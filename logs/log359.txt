Alien life hates you.
Um--I'm not sure
Im sorry Vivix i just had to do it.

60 frames of an alien face, obviously they exist
>impling the government wouldn't try to cover it up.

Well other than military secrets theyre just guys in suits
i still want my fucking hands on a laser weapons
when its a huge televised event...hard to cover up
Yes we know you :P
governments are always completely honest
Yeah, wikileaks are just making that stuff up (Sarcasm)
The government hide OPERATION NORTHWOODS look it up
wikileaks guy should be shot for treason
Dari, do we know the prime minister?
The conservatives are trying to skrew over small hospitals.
Yeah.

you do realise, that we are all being SARCASTIC?
harriest Johns, Prime Minister :D
...Harriet Jones I mean
Vivix: love and tolerate every one and every thing :)
Everyone knows who you are.
Prime Minister the aliens have told you to suck their PAENUS!
i dont like the ending to this episode, but to be fair the doctor doesnt either
yeaah-- but hes probably indirectly killed and hurt more people with wikileaks than helped anyone
WHAT SEARGENT?!
...Harriest Johns...what a porn name
Sarcasm is hard to detect over the interwebs.
They told you to suck their penis!
Martians look different, duh.

Dark_Horst: its allways been a crossover
I want to visit Alpha Centauri sometime so why arnt the aliens doing anything about it?
HELP US!

Dohoho

Nice one Meanwhile :P
Sycorax Tom

Heya everyone, whats happenin
...SOI FON PONY. Ah, back when Bleach hadn't jumped the shark http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8hns1fHk_pc/TzRPSS6IyrI/AAAAAAAAeQw/85BWMh_ySA8/s1600/128745+-+bleach+ponified+Pony_UnTastic+Soi_Fon.png
no moop the U.S goverment wouldn't do anything like that! right...right?:(
Doctor who is happening
They couldn't
Hazard3: Have you met an advanced race of super beings?
They aren't exactly an advanced alien race of super beings. They're galactic parasites on a ship made of asteroid.
ah dr who
Hardly the Q continuum by any leap or bound.
no and I highly doubt they would act like teenagers
"no, I don't love him"
Because I'd say compared with all other life that we know of we're an advanced race of super beings.
EPIC SEX SCENE
And we're all dumb as fuck most of the time.
"Yes, we AGREE"
lol
Truer words were never spoken dari.
STASIS
How goes it bronies? :D
"durrrrr"
ohai [SWAG]thehated5689
lol
no one sees that
mind control
What if we're the most inteligent species in the universe?
...
doctor who?
eh
yay
I don't mind
The universe is bucked
Gumri: what a horrifying thought.
Right now WE ARE the most intelligent species
ohai [SWAG]thehated5689
is this actually dr who?
Yes.
Nothing will change that till we find it
because your smarter than them dumbasses
"JASSOon, PRESS X TO JAAASOOON!!"
How large the universe is, it's not unlikely that there are aliens out there, but who knows if they're smarter than us or not.
Was that Nick Frost...?
should be
we were late
too the roof
then they start to jump off like on Dead Space
kim you say a large univerese as if we know how big it could possibly be
*jim
JUMP!
Doctor Who?
JUMP JUMP JUMP JUMP!
neat
So it is.
everyoneclaims that aliens are smarter but has anyone thought that they might be stupid
hmmm.... zombies on the roof that could be ba- OH HELL YEAH;F REE RIFLE!
Have you heard of the ps vita before?
Well, even if there were an early race, they could have exterminated eachother, just look at nuclear weapons
true
/me nomnomnom
I'm more than a little worrried they would be like conquistadors.
*strokes beard* true
ohai Stallion_of_War
hi
lots of roof space i guess
"nothing, we will just give up like PUSSIES"
so what will kill us first? Aliens, Natural Disaster, or Each other?
Each other.
well, it's safe to imagine that, if aliens have found a way to accomplish intergalactic travel in a feasible amount of time, that they are at least more technologically advanced than us.
Im worried that they would be like a bunch of routey teenagers.
Aliens that cause us to destroy each other with natural disaters
Leaveo ur planet!
or THE STALLION OF WAR
YOU CANT TELL US WHAT TO DO!
well, gtg guys, see you at BMN

i feel reminded of that inception fanfic
a fanfic
Pinkie needs to meet Spongebob desperatley
well, maybe it's not a mistake. Maybe there was an era before Luna and Tia, where they used that flag as a representation of all 3 pony races together as 1, and Celestia and Luna are just personifications (er, Ponyfications?) of those symbols on the flag.
Patrick is Pinkie in disguise
this is soo full of freindship <3
i now want nothing but this video. screw good grade
Epic PMV is Epic

Makish: brony i think
oh of course, Grass type vs Bug type works perfectly, but Flying type vs Bug Type, loses in 2 shots. BULLSHIT.
prepare for trouble
make it double
Ho ha hah ho
pffffff the fuck?
Dari! No spoilers!
OH JUST STEAL THE POKEMON YOU TWITS
Flamethrower is only obtained by cahrmander at level 42, meaning he stops all of his evolutions. Therefor, Ash never evolves his pokemon. He is an absolute idiot
oh gawd
Rocket is best team
OH GOOD LORD!
Link says spoilers warning in it
Kabuki. They's surprisingly good at this.
How do they afford all the costumes if they're broke and trying to steal Pokemon for money, anyways?

Rape face
Surrender now, or prepare to fight!
Yeah
13that's it, we have to ban daribot now

Why is meowth the only pokemon who ever learned english?
omg a talking meowth
Maybe then he'll go to bed.
Meanwhile he did it to try to woo a girl meowth
BRB
Meanwhile: because then it wouldnt be funny
epic fail time!
Master Roshi: ....did that cat just talk?
CK|TheKittyIsSleep: because they have a pokeball filled with costumes they stole.
Shizuka: nonsense. if we did, who would troll otakon?
He went out of his way to.... it's why he can't use Payday.
It isn't funny anyway.
I would rip that coin off of Meowth's head
GASP
James used stringshot!
"Aggh!"
He got shot down horribly by her anyway..tragic really
Psyduck!
:D
dat psyduck

Meanwhile: fair enough, there is an actual explination somewher about it consuming 'experience' but meh, its pokemon
Psyduck sucks.

>Liqueribriam?
You forgot?
HOW
lol
Meowth used voltorb bowling
lol at dat "electric attack"
Wabuffet is better than Psyduck
You can't even shout out a real attack? just "Electric Attack"?
Do Voltorbs die when they explode?
Team rocket you can steal Psyduck if you want
PUNT
Not even Team Rocket want you.
We wont miss them
Veewave: Of course, there would be no point to the otherwise
Why are pokeballs modeled after voltorb? Dont remember the series ever touched on that one...pretty tough to tell the difference between an inanimate object & pokeball pokemon with selfdestruct in the game...Thank Prof. Oak! -_-

Psyduck for SSB4!
...this is bullcrap
dammit, would it have killed the writers to learn the names of attacks?
The only "Confusion" here is the show's inability to show attacks correctly! D:<

It only works with a headache.

Theres four plants for each element and only that element gains anything from eating it, and one is the favorite of each skylander so they get a lot more if they eat that one

Samurai Jack is the best series created
Why didnt Aku do that to begin with?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDY5YpLqypk
Because Aku is arrogant beyond words.
Gondor was busy needing years of therapy.
He didn't want to
He's like Trixie, if Trixie could do anything useful.
Foooreeever
Pinkie samurai jack will be best cross over
Hnnng dis opening~
Joined by Pinkie Pie
Because he knew he would come back later
I REALLY wanna watch the full Series
Jack meets Han Solo. How awesome is this potentially?
who wants to hear a joke?
He wanted him gone but that was a last resort.. to send him in the future
I watched the pilot and thought it was AWESOME

omg tara strong
Is that...Tara Strong's voice?
yay
@Luna I love animanics!,Could you do satam!
And this cartoon was already cool!
To be fair, she IS in a lot of series.
Twilight Sparkle is best alien
Mulch.
...And that's Tom Kenny voicing the yellow robot
0,14also, mfw that looks like the Blockade Runner
^
Dat ring.
da RING
They do sound really similar
0,14Where was Gondor when space aliens went into the Ring?
The ring of fire
SaxyPretender: this reminds me of Symbionci Titan
Tara Strong does EVERYTHING when it comes to cartoons! (I mean that in a good way, of course.) :)
SaxyPretender: LONG AGO IN A DISTANT LAND
That's what I just said, otakon ;3;
Don't get Cocky
They evolve into fluttershys
how did twilight get in this situation
Why do the ships look like WII Spitfire planes
0,14...
And Timmy Turner
LadyCanary: you too?
Who also does magic oddly enough
0,14so much Star Wars references
Her name is Ribena?
SPACEBALLS
And just like the falcon it breaks
I said the prince and princess remind me of Alana and Lance from Sym Bionic Titan otakon.
Cypresswolf:tara strong as does this character :) in mlp fim!
ENGLISH ROBOT
...can't identify VA for Ribena's brother
Where the silk!
Evil will always triumph over good, because good is dumb!
Earth!
....I still can't get over the fact that's tom Kenny voicing Mulch
LadyCanary: this is probably where the idea originally came from
Dat wet rock
Jerk aliens
Lol
Twilight Sparkle and Jack have met before FACT
Oh noes
LOL
Dumb rock
Lol
Probably, except these siblings are getting along a lot better than Alana and Lance did, otakon.

Oh no indeed.
Akubugs!

What is Aku's obsession with them?
run you fool!
Aku is best robotics genius
lolnope
You will see Aku. Because I said so.
well, he was fairly polite
I think I'll work on my fanfic some more.
Oh my freaking....

Aku is supposed to be a japanese demon right? How the hell does he know robotics?
Magic.
Jack has the Robotics Expert perk
/me likes the design of the insect royal's wings.
It's the future
He took over Japan
from where?
Yeah Know
"I'm Samurai Jack, and I'm here to rescue you!"
Plus he's had the entirety of the time since ancient Japan to advance technology.
^^^^
And no one was able to stop him..at all
Exactly.
this is CENTURIES beyond what originally happened
Jack has the Highest Karma stat ever
He's invincible except to jacks sword.
"Sup, my Peeps"
And high sneak stats
And we never get to see Aku die
Pity
Nope we know it happens though
Who made this show?
I'm pondering whether i should continue eating these cheetos
Mako died

Flash back?
Well, it is a world that is incredibly crime free...anything that isn't proper to Aku, means Jack is involved
See? N'yeah!
what would twilight sparkle do..... oh wait
So Aku was a dick even back then?
Crime free my ass.
eeyup, SymBionic Titan
He was ALWAYS a dick
See, Twilight Sparkle meeting Jack
What a story Aku.
Aku is a Master of Evil.
Aku dont give a buck.

He is Discord in Disguise

But it is a ordered horrorable side of evil
Wilt Chamberlin?

They need to chop things up but can't have any blood, so everything is either robotic or some form of demon that turns into dust or smoke or something.
Who was the male bug's VA

Relaxing like needles on your bum.
13and then bronystate was lalalalala unto movie night
LadyCanary: you say that like you've never had accupuncture
I have not.
Because I hate needles....
cordless electric needle injector
13acupuncture, because opening hundreds of tiny wounds is somehow good for you
well then you'd know needls in the ass are very very relaxing.
0,14so is this video is the new Pinkiequest
needles are not magic
Shizuka, not hundreds
just a few dozen
Shizuka, at least not for any treatment i'm aware of, is normally 15-30ish
sounds like fun
I would pop
also, MFW people use "fear of needles" as a reason not to get a tattoo. IT'S NOT EVEN A REAL SYRINGE.
10,02Setting something else up, gimme min
13you are injecting foreign particles into your SKIN
Still, I've heard it hurts terribly.
60, 59, 58, 57, 56
LadyCanary: tattoos or acupuncture?
Tattoos.
13sb should lrn2testcard
what's your name?? tattoo...
LadyCanary: depends on the artist. Some have such a light touch you barely feel them, others had such a heavy hand it feels like the ink is gonna bleed through the other side of your body.
really the best thing to do when getting a tattoo is to have some music or something playing on headphones, and try to zone out until the artist is done.
13tattoos, because when you want to make a decision that sticks with you forever, make it a misspelled slogan that won't be witty next year, much less decades down the line
hi
hi ho Ganon181
Shizuka: that's the stupid ones. Others get tattoos that are extremely meaningful.
and make sure you pick a dragon that will end up looking like a unicorn 30 years later
ohai Ganon181
for instance, my mom had the Tree of Life tattooed after she nearly died, to symbolize her zeal for life and what it has to offer.
my aunt has her kids' names tattooed as a bracelet around her wrist.
yo mah boi
is anyone elses stream working
That's beautiful, WRITEity.
no stream here
10,02lrn2testcard?
10,02Stream is back up

tom is best freeman

Hmm
emangamer: http://i40.tinypic.com/2n9fck8.png
Shizuka: have you heard?
13the voice of the player character in all six myst games died
RawketLawnchair: silly, that VA was male
awww
10,02Wait, does Gordon Freeman even say anything in the game?
What? nooo!
13but that's not all
emangamer: eenope. She just had an AMAZING range.
13they also voiced alpha 1 in freespace :<
voice actor could've done both male and female voices
SuperBrony64: ...that's the joke.
SuperBrony64 nope
SuperBrony64: nope
Males can do feminie voices, emangamer.
I see a distinct lack of a stream... Oh, well...
10,02Then how could his VA die if he never said anything?
Doctor Freeman needed no lines, just a crowbar
Vaception.
Does anypony remember what the A movie was for the week where the B movie had aliens ressurecting the dead?

did TOY_PON3 go to bed?

i know i just asked but then i got DCd
that's a guy who can do a feminine voice
I forget what movie that wasm emangamer... and the B movie was Plan Nine from Outer Space.
10,02I get it...but I didn't know he never said anything when I heard it this morning :/

I like that.
Well... it was Ed Wood's film he was most proud of. That says a LOT... he was-- honestly-- trying to make it a significant message film. Honestly.
Ed Wood made a LOT of shitty films.
/me pokes Ganon181 with a turkey leg
he was a Z Movie Messiah.
wha?
DINNER.
It does have the unique distinction of spawning Criswell's only "prophecy" to ever come true. "I predict that this is the film you will be remembered for."
the uwe boll of ancient movie making
well.....this brony is off to bed everypony.....ga'night.....

The thing about Wood, is, well, yes there were a LOT of bad flicks. But Ed's were sincere. He wasn't trying to make a quick buck off teens at the drive-in making out. He was trying to make MOVIES. Serious, quality movies. He was just very very bad at it. And it shows... these are flicks that just somehow... you get it?

How do I put this... Plan Nine... You can watch it and enjoy. That movie just mentioned that never actually got shown and there was 90mmins of dead stream but no-one minded... well...
The chat MUST DIE

Epic Movie does not exist. There is no such movie with that title. It was NEVER Shown, NEVER streamed. We enjoyed, happily, a 90minute blank stream. END OF DISCUSSION.

Ingwaz: I don't know what it was for me tbh

WRITEity: indeed, and Sony is no better with their VITA plans
MelaPonie: Im not joking about being insane... i stayed up for 4 days straight once and i hear and sometimes see things that arent there...

WRITEity: i could understand UMvC3 if it had been say...1.5 years after the original
but 8 months is unacceptable
ya know, paul... from yesterday... hotmail chat?
MelaPonie: at least you got sleep, i didnt... and i was drinking the whole time too it was amazing
I don't get it. Where is Mario?
Ingwaz: I couldn't You release a new game, you have it be more than just adding a few more characters to the roster.
¦¦¦
oooooh.. right, yea you are the one with the rabbit picture?
Midnight_Tempest, yeah... i had less drugs involved
It gets creepy when the talking head on the tv screen starts insulting you personally
WRITEity: i....i dont even
Pills here!

speaking of drinking, i think i fixed my skittles vodka recipe proportions

srry if the link is too long
and now i have to turn the stream off, need the cpu power to compile firefox
cause a stream uses soo much cpu power :P
it does
pegs one of my cores
actualy laggs the chat, flashplayer only uses one core
i highly doubt that the firefox project actually supports multiple processor compilation
ohai
it does
super silly cider squeezy
unfoundbug: its jumping betwene using two cores and one, doesnt suport it well but it does
he flies
you only on a dual core machine?
yup
next one will hopefully be a quad

your concerns make more sense now

yeah, on a quad now, new one in a few months should be an 8 core
DeadpoolDash: well he is a pegasus, lol

04Apache
04F-22
/me searches
Drake
honestly
I think we should create entirely new models
04surewhynot]
because remember this is 2069
04True
milk!
we'll be past sixth generation models even
04But we'll have to base it off of current manufacturers
probably 7th or 8th gen, whatever that is
cider
04Like Boeing, Lockheed etc.
haha the Apache's nice
yeah
well
remember the next generation air dominance page I showed you?
04oooooh
04Yes I do
root beer
04The F-22 looks badass
its like superbrony is some sort of magical creature
yeah
he created a lake
it's one of the best jets of 2011
lets go swim
we should draw concept art
uh
*you and Xeli should
he's a wizard!
04XD
04Drawing machines is difficult
04But if it's just sketches

there should be a water bomb to fill that hole

i know right? seems like a lot of work just to fill it up
I prefer the raptor Drake

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_generation_jet_fighter
04But then it's your choice
Yeah I showed you that one yesterday
they look similar
04I know
I'll probably redesign it
04I'll*
04:)
what?
04Unless you want to draw it
wish I had a bucket of infinite water, that'd be sweeeeet
Yeah but if you accidentally tipped it over it'd be hell to clean up.
would make a really good hydroelectric plant thoguh
both good points, infinite power
04Meaning
04I thought I was drawing the designs
04I'd obviously take directions from you
00,10MahBoi777 you should look in to the technic pack then
I won't draw it Drake
I'll probably make a nice little scribble
let you do the rest
and describe it
I'm good, I don't play Minecraft anymore
04XD
04alright
04But if it's your design you'll still need to tell me what to do

what LVl are you?
direct energy weapons what does this imply
and of course pewpew
04I'll accept them here because it's a plane
just pingin ya for the heck of it, lol
04But I imagine a straight beam, rather than the Star Wars autocannon lasers
yeah but I wasn't expecting that
Lol
probably
it'd takeup a shitload of energy
limited use time then
yeah
BAM balanced
well it'd probably be used in short shots
rather than long beams
also the beam would have to weaken with distance
so that balances it out
04And in fact
!!!
!
04The beam probably WOULD cause an explosion
out of nowhere
04not simply slice through whatever it's shooting at
/me looks for the article

hi DainboRash, lol
04http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams
04It's TVTropes but it's accurate
04It has some useful notes on lasers as military weapons
Heya :)
Anyone need a 55 gallon barrel of personal lubricant? http://derpy.me/XLumR
well lasers would definitely just cause a small dent
or similar
i will be back but mutch later going over to a friends place
knock out stabilizers and such
accidently spelled ur name wrong:P
Well I imagine like
unless it hits the engine
industrial lasers maybe on a little bit of steroids
then it kabooms the engine
so it's not PEW through a big titanium block
well
whut
seriously
bye bye every pony
using star wars as an example yet again
which is basically what you say
55gallons
04Apparently lasers are generally meant to target explosive parts of the target
?
any of you seen a star wars laser hit something that's not a person?
couple of those and a waterslide would be epic
04so that it results in an explosion
mostly aircraft
Logically because warmth.
04So using a laser on an aircraft and hitting the fuel tanks
04kaboom
And I don't get why lasers explode on impact in so many sci-fi movies anyway
causes a minor explosion depending on the size/distance/etc.
yeah
Indeed
even comes with a pump
definitely
if you hit the engines etc.
knocks it out
04Which means that lasers, if the energy and time it takes to fire them is somehow reduced, then they're actually pretty effective
04Especially against aircraft with defenses against missiles, like heat/IR flares
lol at the product description, certainly being honest
normally if you hit the wing or similar you'd knock out the stabilizers
and suddenly the chat was quiet
so basically a precise, virtually unavoidable (lol speed of light) disabling utility thing
makes sense
big adult party? lol
it'd be pretty fucking overpowered if it;s a beam
04It'd be more
04A single strike weapon
04A split second of intense hear
04heat
still
04To knock out stabilisers, as NS said, or the fuel tanks.
Well im off to bed I'll be back later night everypony

warning: long post
I'm a particle physics PhD working at CERN, on the Large Hadron Collider. We try to keep all 27 kilometers tunnels as slippery as possible at all times, on the theory that if the hadrons are already going close to lightspeed, maybe that will help push them over the edge. We make sure they're always going downhill, too, and we use fans to give them a boost. The fans dry out the lube some, which is why I can only give it 4 stars, b
rofl
oh god a crowd control weapon using microwaves
hot
LOL + 6_9
04so punny
a 1 star for no instructions
I am afraid to play minecraft...I could see myself just wasting way to much time on it
too
hah
its not that bad
im looking at the review now....surely most of these are jokes?
unless you REALLY mod it
must be
still
No kidding, I've wasted like 2 hours just watching
"Who in their right mind would try to stop 10 lubricated angry gorillas from stealing stuff? "
they're should be lasers by 2069
Minecraft <3
DeadpoolDash: people build some awesome stuff in Minecraft
there
im reading the "sliding back into the game" review atm
fffs
04Just not constant laser weaponry
04Like BEAM SPAM
yeah
Rhy's energy daggers are fine
I know
lol lubricated angry gorillas:D
due to having a physical object as a base
04A few lasers to intercept missiles or as quick-fire weaponry
Who's streaming?
I am just scared of my creative side coming out and ruling me
Sounds more like plasma tbh
with the thing at the base
but anyway imagination etc
04A few plasma weapons, as long as they're practical
04A sword in a gun setting isn't practical at all
:D "i experianced the heat thing when i had an adventurous incident with a toaster"
you got to the "no instructions" review yet, by far my favorite
A sword is pretty unwieldy anyway so it's good it's daggers.
I got tired of it after a loooong while
a sword is only unwieldy if you swing it
or it's one of those heavy ones
04http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyRabbitRomanceIsForKids
04Against guns?
not saying minecraft is bad, it's good, just gets kinda repetitive after awhile like most other games
04It's still impractical
im on the awkward lube first date atm
daggers are a good compromise
out of context we sound crazy
and yeah I guess there are things more wieldy than like
claymore swords and such lol
04Because no guard is gonna wield a plasma sword when they've got an assault rifle that reaches infinity times the distance
crazy is good
04AND is easier to use. That's why swords have fallen into disuse
but they require aim
and aiming sucks
04Only for you
/me runs
Besides
04That's why guards receive training
04To get better at aiming
at close range swords are far more potent
04Of course
04But with guns you can take down foes before they get close
if you're fast enough that is
yeah
once they're close
you're screwed
04Of course the enemy will get close sometimes
04Like by surprise
unfoundbug: i just read the no instructions one, you're right, its hilarious :D
04But that's why soldiers have combat knives
i can just imagine that actually happening which is quite worrying
dat lube
and that's why Rhy will kick their ass
and make them go crying to mummy
or kill them before that
im reading the one beneath it...its turned into fire escaping, and tripping over "1 of 37 pet muskrats"
o.0 the prison one

Who is streaming?
XD
Anyway Drake
10,02Me
10,02:3
I think we should name the aircraft
SB ^^
of course, I suspect we'll have our heli blown up several times
so we'll cycle through names on that
Rhy needs one for her jet
though
04Her jet will never be destroyed
04Maybe at the end in the climactic battle
04But I dunno
04The jet is so cool
04It's basically her signature item.
probably at the end
yeah
but name
that's what I'm saying
04http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=2119
04hurr lucky bitch
04Well
I used to think "Storm Rider" but hurr
that's just lame
04Storm Rider
04no
we could go with something like "Raptor", "Thunderbird", etc.
04"Black Fury"
04or
04"<insert colour here> Fury"
minecraft boats.....how do they work?
eh
"Night Fury"
no
anyway
eh
04XD
Minecraft water
04"Phantom Storm?"
lame
try one word stuff
doesn't need to be 2 words
04I keep getting the idea that Rhy would come in with the jet, bombard the ground targets/air targets, and disappear
and minecraft walls
04"Skyscraper"
04Holy shit that's a cool name for a jet
/me takes note of that
hm
not bad
Top of the morning everypony! :)
10,02Ohai RaveBrony :D
Mmorning
Good morning RaveBrony
Hi :$ are you streaming SuperBrony64?
10,02Yup ^_^
Awesome! I need to get this game... :D
04"Viper"
04"Nightingale"
04"Gladiator"
...
fuck no
Nightingale is okay but that's a bloody singsong bird
the other 2 are gay as shit, Drake
04I still like "Skyscraper" because everytime I imagine a plane flying and water vapor trails from the wing I imagine it literally scraping the sky
yeah I know Drake
Skyscraper could work
04Eh
04Maybe
04I prefer to go with more metaphorical names, but again it's your plane
04Skyhawk is just redundant
hey everypony can I get the schedule for movie night?
10,02Hey, check the home page
^
10,02But, here, let me link you the latest newsletter
k
What about bird names?
thnx
04If you don't use Skyscraper I'm totally using it for something else
like Falcon, Eagle, etc.
Im going bowling with some pals after school today, hope i dont miss it! >.<
heh
10,02We're having a special schedule on Saturday.
well, I like Skyscraper
O.o
oh damn I wont be here
just thinking of other things and then comparing
Phantom Hawk would be suitable
shortened to hawk
since bird of prey + phantom for the same reason you stated before
10,02http://i.imgur.com/rqUNd.png
on Saturday night and Morning but not in the day
but eh
04I keep thinking "Phantasmagoria" but I just want to legitimately use that words
what
10,02In PST it is 3:02 AM
10,02In EST it is 6:02 AM
04http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/phantasmagoria
Babble with Bronies? What is this? O.O
hmm Top Secret
nah
lol
design would probably be grey/silver to black
oh I have a great idea for a movie...Police Academy 2
depending on what we'll be using it for
woah is 10pm here on friday night :D
(pink flowery and rainbow)
nope.avi
now red
04The colour of the jet doesn't matter as long as it's grey/black really, because then at night time it's easier
04to stay in stealth
I still like Raptor
10,02Babble with Bronies is a podcast that does interviews with bronies.
Its 6AM here O.o
:o
04In daytime it doesn't matter what colour it is. It'll still be seen.
it's 3 here
Sweet! lol
Skyraider?
04NS Raptor means Theif
04Skyraptor?
2:04 pm friday
Rhy is a sort of thief
maybe
Strange :P

that's somehow related to clouds what is this

04Nimbuslancer?
yeah
Sure Drake
04Nimbo makes me think of a whore

well
04Becase bimbo

04giggity
d'awwwwwwwww
nah
stratolancer
04Stratosphere
no
04It wasn't a name
04I was figuring out the etymology of the name
Stratus clouds
04Ah
04I prefer Numbuslancer
I studied clouds in my free time in year 5/6
04Nimbuslancer*
Nimbus
it's a bit long
sounds like 2 words
04Stratoslancer
04I prefer the s in there
I don't
04But again, your choice
well
it's our decision
04Stratolancer then
04Not really
what do you think, Xeli?
yes it is
04I want to keep our individual items our personal choice rather than a group decision, unless it's stupid
still
04Like a 5 clip rocket launcher as the signature weapon
er

04That's an awesome name
what are you
slapping me for
naming our helicopter
04To get your attention
or at least the 3rd one
04Our third helicopter
alrighty everypony it is early i'm gonna get some sleep see ya on Friday stream
04So the first is an Apache
04Are we gonna change models each helicopter?
Cya OneTrickPon!
*OneTrickPony
well
Take care!
uuuh
Rhy's gonna modify each one like fuck
later OneTrickPony
I have no idea you 2 are better at names
except for the commando
though she'll still do it a little
04Well, alright
I say the heli gets destroyed at the last mission
though that means Nathan and Leo have no transport
hi everpony
ohai Kipkat07
i thought the chat broke for a minute there
04ground vehicle they steal?
MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!!!!!
nowhere near as fast
or they could steal another heli
but that defeats the entire point of having ours blown up
I mean
04Who says they travel fast?
04Rhy might have to wait for them, or they might not travel very far.
if Rhy used the jet at a slow speed on low altitudes
they probably would be able to hang on
or maybe we can create a cargo space in the jet
12 HOURS 30 MINUTES TILL FRIDAY STREAN
Eeyup.
04I like the idea that they get split from Rhy and they have to travel via vehicle to a meeting place not far from a city
mmhm
or at the very least
Rhy provides cover fire
or leads the aerial enemies away
Indeed :P
04yeah
04But it's not as if they're being actively huntefd
04hunted
04It'd be in the middle of a warzone with the Mercenary Company told to shoot on sight, with the US/Russia/China/Japan armies converging or something.

Episode 17 of season 2 "Hearts and Hooves Day" airs in 1 days, 3 hours, 57 minutes, 0 seconds (Feb 11 2012 15:30:00 GMT)

thats scary
not dari
ffs
mind's not working
04XD
04Yeah
Haha,i had watch EP17
either that or Rhy's forced to leave the Skyscraper somewhere
and in the sequel/future/whatever
04She's gonna keep it one way or another
she comes back and uses it again
04yeah
saviour!
04XD
that'd be epic actually
and it'd make more sense
04Yeah
Have ag good sleep
let's do that
Night SB
04:D
she'll be bitchy about it for a while
but that means we'll need to give her a new jet
in the sequel
like the Skyscraper II
10,02Thanks everypony for tuning in, I'm off to bed. Night ^_^
04I'd assume that by the end of the story Nathan doesn't have the preference against killing he once did, so using his .50 cal isn't out of the question
04Not really
04Maybe she just finds where she left it?
or Skyraptor/Skylancer/Skyraider
04And like
well she'll definitely find it where she leaves it
I intend for that
04Nathan and Leo are pinned down, and Rhy pulls a Big Damn Heroes with the recovered Skyscraper
but still
it'll be in the far future
or somewhat in the future
and yes
XD
that'd be awesome
04There's no hope left...
04Then...
04*whistling sound, slowly rising*
04KABLAM
xD
Good night SuperBrony64!
Thanks for streaming! :)
well anyway
we need to make a plot
so
how do we start out?
night SuperBrony64|Zzz
04I would figure that it starts from Rhy and Nathan being friends, close family friends
04Their two families go for an outing and have a car accident or something where they are the only survivors
lame
04Then, they're both kidnapped by the company who has had their eye on them for some time, but couldn't just take them because of their family.
that's magic
aka unrealistic
04well then
probably shouldn't know each other
04I just don't want us to have anything to come back to
04Like
04Neither of them have any family left, so they basically go along with the company because there's nothing else to do
Rhy could kill her parents
/me hides
okay no
but
I think Leo should probably start in
and be all disdainful of Rhy and Nathan
when they join
04Yeah
04I imagine he'd be in the company for a few years before Rhy and Nathan
yeah
Sounds good
04Because he's the professional and all
and yeah
and the cold dude
but yeah
I'd imagine that Rhy and Nathan would be in similar places
when the kidnapping occurs
perhaps a bomb blast at a zoo or similar
04TERRORISTS
04or
but they don't previously know each other until they meet on the transport
04maybe the mercenary company had been hired for a job
and then shoved into teams
Leo should be there
04they get caught in the crossfire
yeah basically
that's why I said zoo
04And their parents/family dies and they're forced to work for them
he should grab us and be like "you're coming with me, kiddos"
04surewhynot
DRAKE
ohdear
People
You're both in my fucking story
and
04XD
drake get name
Yay! Slice of Life!
lmao
:D
sounds good to me
Anyway Drake
:p
anyway
wait >rhy
04aye?
penis or no penis
?
Female
sounds good to me
04no penis
It would be bad for everyone
):
04yes
04indeed
you just spoiled my lifelong dream
anyway
Drake
I say bomb at the zoo
so we have this now
Generation III
Base for Septem: Kazesho Ikezawa
Kazesho Ikezawa // Zanacross Redcloak // Uyen/? // Dirge // Vruet/? // Nathan Hallmark // Rhy Feng
or bomb at the airport
perfect!
or CAR BOMB
04airport
04bombing a zoo doesn't make much sense
04or a car bomb is good too
car bomb would be too coincidental
airport makes the most sense as a target
though so is airport
and yeah
airport
I'm going to antartica and Drake is going to the artic
8D
04XD
ok no
since my name implies I'm semi-chinese
I'll be going to china
Drake will be going to the US
both from Australia
but there is no china! ;o;
this is a diff story Majin XD
well then
04XD
I'M GONNA SPAM TF WITH NONSENSE ABOUT MINE
actually i explained the entire plot before
one moment
lmao
anyway Drake
so airport
we line up
04airport
04then kaboom
waiting at the register
then
kaboom
yeah
then dust etc.
we find out parents/family are dead, scream
Rhy survives because she lags behind her family
Nathan survives because he's in the loo
but then there's toilet bombs
anyway
Leo picks me up first
because I'm unconscious
04XD
then he finds Nathan in the loo
and at that point I'm back awake
and then he's like
"you're coming with me, kiddos"
chat is ded
I'd say that Leo's 18 at the beginning of the fic
and Nathan and Rhy are 12-13
or younger
04no
04way
this is the prologue
04I wanted them to be 15 at least
04Well
04alright
04prologue sure
or if you want no prologue
04wait no
04because
04no
meh
04prologue
Chat is ded
then 15
04I want to detail how Rhy, Nathan and Leo bond
and Leo is 20
or 18 even
19
