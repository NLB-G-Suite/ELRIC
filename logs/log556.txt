roll your way to victory~
the yellow ones
Huzzah!
The fighter was my second guess
Dark_Horst: i think they look both similar
Unicycle to the finish.
00,02didnt actually expect that to take off
physics sees Phase4 rollin', it hatin' (but PP don't give a buck)
seya guys in a bit
bai brony_swan
bye for now brony_swan
um hey sergio im not gonna play ZPS im gonna be busy re writing my fic
Bye brony_swan
Later everyone, I am gonna go get some lunch
Quick_Thinker: no worrys mate,i lost the will to play too :)
this fic is a mess and i think it needs to be thought out more
Bye MegaMoonShine.
What would AJ, FS, and RD do with Physics?
bye for now MegaMoonShine
sergio_scriptor: worries*
as well as changed entirely
Bai MegaMoonShine
Quick_Thinker: well good luck writing it then :)
That looks like some kind of cargo dropship.
Bye MegaMoonShine
yep in fact chapter 1 is gone now
Bamf.
OmegaMetroidBrony: no drag/friction/etc for RD
/me Is gonna play some TF2
backflip
its still on fanfic i cant delete that one easily
backflip x8
Racing physics
however the FIMfic on is gone
00,02and then everyone lived
00,02the end
I like how it wouldn't take off slowly but instead went straight into "Do a flip" mode.
Quick_Thinker: well i cant wait to read the pre-version and the after version
THAT looks BADASS
Well that went well.
O_O
:D
OmegaMetroidBrony: AJ would probably make days like 30 hours long for extra working time...
Deploy parachute AFTER flight. AFTER. Not before.
i might even send the beta read to some of you guys to gvie sugestions
Or not change anything and keep it Twilight Standards
Phase4: you want to explainus what was that :P
But who knows, she's stubborn as a mule
*explain us
It tripped on a rock.
extra long runway...
00,02it go boom
00,02big bada boom
That thing is too fat to take off.
FlutterPhysics would make everything soft, serene and not very frightning/surprising
OmegaMetroidBrony: and she'd slow down time a tad
because she is made of dark matter
Phase4: burn all of the grass
Well, it's in the air.
That's progress.
Inquery on why time would be slowed slightly
Meanwhile: it's the sound of progress
morning, everypony! :) How are we all today?
Moin Sylandest
Pfft, the snap on the parachute broke half the wing off.
morning, OmegaMetroidBrony :)
OmegaMetroidBrony: sudden actions and stuff wouldn't be as sudden
Hi Sylandest ,fairly good,we are watching Phase4 impossible machines shows
Allo Sylandest.
Morning Sylandest.
Ah
'splosion with no death...
I was thinking along the lines of AJ time extension not matrix like
seems legit...
:P
Sylandest: good afternoon (from where i live)
/me hugs CrazyCherry, Meanwhile, sergio_scriptor, seatsea
/me hugs Sylandest
sergio_scriptor: so i can see, lol
I'd bet Derpy would be God Tier at Physics
or at least Demigod
/me hugs Sylandest
/me kisses Sylandest on the cheek.
Dat stumble.
/me kisses CrazyCherry back on the cheek :)
OmegaMetroidBrony: she's immune to all other physics... she does what she wants.
Pfft, what happened there?
Can't argue with that
-.O
having a wiered problem with my browser frezzing going to reboot my pc
Bamf.
It's an exploding fish!
seatsea: i had that problem to early in the morning actualy
*too
And again, the wings just fall off.
someone give me a song to listen to on loop for an hour or so...
Derpy's Great Muffin Adventure
I guess I'll be getting rickrolled for the next hour or so...
PonyNegZero: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZcmTl_1ER8
well played Meanwhile...
You're welcome.
sergio_scriptor: No non image links during stream.
well shit man is it hard to write stories if you have Aspurgers XD
Meanwhile: PonyNegZero we asked for it :|
sergio_scriptor: So?
sergio_scriptor: give me, not post in channel
All it needs is a yellow coat of paint and the Beatles
Meanwhile: so i should shut up ?
hiya guys :'(
sergio_scriptor: Mhmm.
Kewl boat
sergio_scriptor: when I wrote "give me", that is a cue for a pm...
glitch?
my TV provider is getting rid of viacom channels!
Oh cool, it works as a boat.
PonyNegZero: :| my bad
thats 26 channels!
O.o
sergio_scriptor: not a problem
Phase4 smash!
/me never watches TV and can't really sympathise.
I'm guessing that includes The Hub
possibly
When did kerbas get boats? with rocket thrusters
O_O
sagas: Since the wings broke off.
00,02screw physics, i'ma boat plane
:F Dat boat plane :F
whats that sound?
Phase4 is Pinkie Pie.
00,02Sylandest, bugs
sagas: at about 1290 during the great kerbal water revolution i think,they wore lead by wiliam kermin that discovered the only rive in the planet
00,02many bugs
Phase4: ....you're obliterating them! XD
uhhh my body decided to wake me up after only 3 hours of sleep
and guess when it changes?
sergio_scriptor: a brave kerbal indeed
Meanwhile, Pinkie is running the Physics Department. Twilight's asleep.
tonight at 12:01 AM :'(
vroom vroom vroom!
the hay explosion and then a sudden burst of speed
um your gonna run out of land sooner or later
well this came is cool
WOAH
Best parachutes ever.
:D
phase you still awake?
no way
still alive
And yet somehow they survived.
he died
00,02Alpha-Omega, going to bed soon
Obviously they had enought minerals to buy the armor upgrade on the capsule
Alright good you were awake all night
the wing is flying away :D
Wing fragment doesn't care.
its a UFO!
^
Hahahaha
:D
Aliens Everywhere!
magnets!
I gtg enjoy the viacom channels
i like how the wing lands so softly and then explodes
see ya
have a great day :)
You too
Nooooo phase nooooo
Im sure I wont
:'(
Is it me or do the explosions look kinda like spiders?
Meanwhile: a little bit
Next time I go to bed I will not listen to music
Meanwhile: wut.
Alpha-Omega: I still have 50 minutes to go before I can turn off this rickroll...
....
a carrousel rocket ? lol ? :P
rickroll?
Welp.
:D
And landing.
now it's a shroom
of death
that...was...AWESOME
I love the smell of dead kerbal in the morning
lol
looks like a space station
and root beer since our coffee machine is missing...
It kinda looks like R.O.B.
This can only end in tears.
So what the point in making it spin besides just fun?
it reminds me of a carrousel
sagas: That's all the point you need! :D
lol
:D
It just ripped off
Rocket has no time for you, it wants to see the world!
sagas: technically, it will go straighter because of gyroscopic effects...
Detached too early
Follow your dreams rocket!
it's still going
there it goes
PonyNegZero: Yes, but I dont think this game takes that in effect
It followed it's dreams into the ground. :/
sagas: not according to Pinkie Pie it doesn't
Shame it had to end that way
does anyone else think the kerbals look creepy?
Yes.
I thought they were monkeys at first
Alpha-Omega: i think they look a little bit cute
Alpha-Omega: I like them
PonyNegZero: Gotta love artificial physics
and some kerbals just want to see the world burn... deal with it...
dat background
O.O
Smoooooooze
SMOOZE!
OmegaMetroidBrony: the first time i saw them i thought they wore fish :P
bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow
Whose streaming?
sagas: more or less
sagas: Phase4

Meanwhile: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lm7jzrrxem1qjv48ho1_1280.jpg
Forget my last statement compared to that kerbals are adorable
nice OC Phase4
Phase4: did u sign up for source filmmaker?
Rickroll and smooze... interesting combo...
XAX: >_>
Bitches brew?
I wonder how they stopped the smooze in the show?
oh god not G1
and then all sexual happend...
Meanwhile: I was kinda slow with that image because the speed at which Safari on my iPod renders websites is atrocious.
XAX: Well. Ok then.

Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: he was already said in a vlog that he suports the fandom,but he is not a fan of the show,says it looks good,but not a die hard fan
I'm bored. What could I watch while eating foods.
Your food.
Meanwhile: well played

Watch that video of Bear Grylls eating a maggot.
*Ignores stupid comments*
and now the ad is done and i will never see it again porbely and now i can watch pewdipie :D
FairysHuff: any shows you've been meaning to catch up on?
Sylandest Sadly there aren't any. ~_~
The next streamer will stream when he/she feels like it, nobody knows...
also does any pony want to beta read my fic of MLP FIM crossed with Day Z
FairysHuff: Cartoons?
Sylandest I would catch up on my anime but I don't feel like anime today
08,01sergio_scriptor: i can't; i'm at work
PonyNegZero: :'( yep
FairysHuff: aww...*huggles* well, why dont we find a show you might be interested in?
08,01as to the next person to stream, the official roster says "N/A"
08,01so you'll have to do without for now, i'm afraid

Sylandest Sure, but where to start?
Who wants to do my work for me and not get payed!
You.
Illegals
FairysHuff: hmm...well, you said no anime...what else do you like to watch?

Bai sergio_scriptor
laters, sergio_scriptor
Bye sergio_scriptor :)
Sylandest I liked Babylon 5 and the Stargate series but there are no new shows that have space sci-fi to them. Maybe I should just rewatch those >_>
Seeya sergio_scriptor
bye guys,dont let the slenderman catch you :)
ahhh music
sergio_scriptor: mmmhmmm
bye serg--gone
I'll buck up slenderman with a coffee pot
FairysHuff: perhaps...have you ever considered watching Doctor Who? It's somewhat along the same lines, but very good, in my opinion
Fuck....
Sylandest I'll consider it.
FairysHuff: There's also the ever enjoyable Star Trek series' to consider :) But its up to you
Watching that play through of Slender...
Sylandest Seen them all ^_^
fine
I'm playing slender
FUCK!
FairysHuff: hehehe, me too. They're always good for a replay through though! So there's that! :)
Fucking jumped!
Sylandest True.
OmegaMetroidBrony: :3
That bastard!
But yeah Its electric
Sylandest I shall think of something, if nothing else I suppose I could just watch more Kikoskia lets plays.
ME GUSTA
FairysHuff: sounds like a plan. We won't let you get bored, hehe :D
I would recommend this to a friend of mine...
Sylandest ^_^
He already has SCP-087
i cant tell which is more scary, SCP or Slender
Some of the SCP's are pretty creepy
What's SCP?
I must look more into this SCP thing.
what MegaMoonShine said.
Oh, we're talking about SCP now? Which ones?
Humorous SCP link
http://www.scp-wiki.net/10-30-a-m
I like the SCP's, they're neat.
hmm
All about the new guys
I'd like to thank alexxm for those SCP links
Dafuq did I just read?
OmegaMetroidBrony: I wanna punch a shart
shark*
Good
Because you will punch sharks, think about punching sharks, research punching sharks, dream about punching sharks
OmegaMetroidBrony: Am I meant to be freaked out? Im laughing my ass off here...
No
You're supposed to laugh
Good.
It's working.
I did say humorous SCP link
Slender, still scarey with one headphone
I wanted him to come at me
I dare one of you guys to test SCP-288
he didn't so I got bored
Shit...
I think I know which one that is but....
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-288
SCP - Slender Containment Protocol
Have fun.
Sylandest I decided on DrWho. I haven't watched that since I was a child ^_^
FairysHuff: ee! Good choice! What series are you going to watch? :)
I read that one ages ago
Hello?
Oh hai Rainbow
howdy, Rainbow
Hey Omega.
It is now 12:09 am :P
Hai Rainbow
Sylandest The newer series that restarted the franchise in 2005 with Eccleston as doctor.
Hiya.
10.09 am here
Lol
Good Mornign Omega XD
Sylandest I haven't watched any of them
2:12am here
According to my iPod
*Morning.
Which is probably wrong.
lol
Nearly been up 34 hours
*24
AND I NEED TO PEE BUT SOMEONE IS IN THE SHOWER! OH GOD THE PAIN! O_o
Oh i was gonna say 34
FairysHuff: good pick! Its a good place to start. When you reach the tenth Doctor, you'll be caught up with me, hehe. David Tennant ftw
FairysHuff: hold it! Hold it for dear life!
Whuts Streaming?
Mines still buffering.
Rainbow: The ring
^_^
Buffer circle
Rainbow: nothing at the moment. No scheduled streamer. Tis a dead period
Aw..
I need to keep working on just under 7 hours of sleep... my clan match last night took way too long (opponents complained about lag on our server...)
FairysHuff: is there a second restroom in the house?
MY FAVORITE SHOW
Sylandest Nope.
hey guys
Sylandest Unless you count the kitchen sink. ^_^
We now return to "The buffer circle".
:P
Maybe I should invest in a chamber pot for times like this O_o
FairysHuff: ...bugger. No, i dont count the kitchen sink :D But you gotta watch holding it too long
third tree on the left
How do you do that BOLD name thing with the notifaction?
hey guys
Hey!
/me pokes Rainbow.
Sylandest Shower just stopped, guessing another 20 minutes before bathroom is free.
hey Rainbow how have you been
Good.
/me starts looking online for chamber pots.
Bored. But good.
FairysHuff: tell them to hurry the buck up! :D
Lol.
just barge in, nobody will care
pony_7007: nice dubs
:C
GDI I can't find any decent SCP's
/me is rageing because the stream dosent want to load
Lol
seatsea: no stream...
Seat they havent put anything up.
PonyNegZero: what dubs?
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1981

WHERES PHASE4 WHEN YOU NEED HIM.
PonyNegZero: Oh, those dubs, thanks i like them too
facehoof
Rainbow: he went to sleep...
Where was Gondor when there was no stream?
how do you do that?
Rainbow: Sleeping.
OmegaMetroidBrony: http://i.imgur.com/LzUBs.jpg
Where was Meanwhile when Gondor actually was here for once?
Where was Gondor when Gondor was gone?
Rainbow: he has been streaming for a long time he can have a break
How do you do the {BOLD NAME} and ding noise thing?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT I tried playing Civ 5 but found it boring. Too easy and little to do.
I was asking Gondor where it was all the other times.
Meanwhile: That's Minas Tirith, fool!
Rainbow if you want to ping some one just type their name
Like so
MegaMoonShine: You know in almost a year you're the only one who's told me that.
OmegaMetroidBrony Hello
?
Oh hai Rainbow
:(
Damn i need some sleep...
it no work
I saw slenderman
See ya in a few hours everyone...
I ran at him
It only shows up in bold when you're the recipiant
Alpha-Omega ORLY?
MegaMoonShine: But I'm not remaking it now.
Apha-Omega where did you see him
IT NO WORK :(
D:
Rainbow you have to be the one gettin the ping, you can't see other ppl's pings
The slender game
...
Oh.
Okai :3
That game is scarey even with 1 headphone in
dat helps.
Even Pewdiepie doesn't help
I saw pewdiepie play it.
OmegaMetroidBrony: chair mode activate!
His screaming made it worse.
You noobs slenderman is not real he was made up as a scary competition contest
Where might I play this Slender game?
PonyNegZero *BOOP*
PonyNegZero: I'm lying on my stomach on a hard wood floor
i know that Alpha-Omega
I know he isnt real jeez.
I don't chair mode is an option
All pictures were falsified as well
We know -.-
kk
:B
alexxm didn't Slenderman provide you nightmare fuel for a short time?
yeah OmegaMetroidBrony
I dont have nightmare about slendy and stuff.
Rainbow: PING :D
He just keeps me from sleeping
MadSurge PANG
:D
lol I can't sleep, I've screwed up the schedule
I didn't either. I watched all the marble whatever videos
:C

Alpha-Omega I know how you feel bro.
brb guys Pokemon the first movie
Lol XAX
enjoy, XAX
Pokemon rules
XAX: Can I come too? :D
De first movie was a good one.
ME 2?
:)
except the new ones. I don't really like them
*2 minutes in* Oh yes, this sound track.
Is Phase4 the only guy that streams?
Nope
No all the other mods are away
D:
Damn.
Bathroom is FREE! O_o *Bolts for the door at lightening speed*
Nah.
Lol.
wow just 5 mods
Hey guys
Most of the mods stream.
sumica streams
FairysHuff: godspeed!
Hey StinkomanFan :)
Oh hai StinkomanFan
Alpha-Omega: I personally liked all of them.
Hey StinkomanFan
Allo StinkomanFan.
PINGS EVERYWHERE.
lol.
Rainbow :D
cool back when I was a slenderman noob I liked them all but found out it wasn't real then I got pissed
I cant ping myself lol.
ofc you can't what purpose would that serve?
Alpha-Omega... HE IS
He isnt.
............no
Slendys just a creepy pasta entry.
One hell of a creepy pasta
^
Yeah 95% of creepypastas are not real
Damnit, you guys have no sense of fun
Slendy watches all p_o
Pokemon Cursed Black is my favorite Creepy pasta.
So is Lavender town syndrome.
hey StinkomanFan hows your day been
I ever tell you guys about my dream wheere my asshole neighbor broke into my house dressed as Slendy?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVS1UfCfxlU
listening to rainbow factory
And why is slendy such a hot topic to discuss.
Morning
Moin Barbetos|Atwork
we played the slender game
hey Barbetos|Atwork you sleep well
Oooooh sweet monkey jesus that felt good ~_~
I dont have the guts.
Slendy's a hot topic because of the video game
StinkomanFan i think you did
Yeah alexxm
I mean, IGN liked an INDY GAME!
I will never play the game.
When does that happen?
Untill that type of horror is outdated.
Damn my lack of sleep... it's making me imagine spiders out of the corner of my eye
/me isn't one for spiders
Ha, I just signed for a package for my workplace - I feel so empowered!
Aw OmegaMetroidBrony Go sleep then.
NEVER!
Why?
Because I'll end up staying up all night
don't wory scary games get too redundant
If you beat one you beat them all
OmegaMetroidBrony, just repeat there's no such thing as Slendy
Wait how does that work.
OmegaMetroidBrony: don't die, dying is bad
over and over again
I defenatly not playing that game..
Now.
Die? idk about you but I have a Yellow/Red/Green herb mixture
For example dead space 1
That I see the trauma its put you through.
Bitches don't know about the y/r/g
was good
Spoilers: SLENDY WILL MESS YOUR SHIT UP
Dead space aint scary.
Just its jumpscares.
Dead Space was startling
I wouldn't say that
played dead space 2 good too
not scary
Dead space 3 looks like lost planet
lol
Lol.
dead space relays to much on jump scares
^
Survival horror will now be known as survival action, unless it is indie survival horror.
Though they still get me
Don't forget the soundtrack
I quote from Dead Space 2, "Cross my heart and hope to die, stick a needle in your eye."
The missing link between COD and Amnesia.
O____________________O

She is my screensaver
You know I intended my name to be Rainbow Taco.

pony_139488: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-CkRtPZMZ8
So... Slenderman
Ok, but there's a problem.
How do we know he's really a man?
Since MLP is considered to be gay to anyone but someone who cares about it, she might be offended, because as always, anybody thinks MLP is for little girls, but a brony.
hmm
I already sent a message to all my friend last night that I'm a brony, and some people reacted with surprise, and some hat, none yet from other bronys.
I stopped caring about what they think of me a long time ago. Besides, internet friends all consider me a nice guy :D
*Hate
I enjoy every show pritty much
Show them ponies, if they don't like it. Live and let live
Sept that only way is essex
probably would like it
just dont want to support them
pony_139488: not the best move, you don't need to "come out"
I appreciate otherponies actually answering my question.
pony_139488: just be yourself and pretend like they knew about it all along
Rain: Herrroooo?
Feel the ground and bring it out casually only if you're discussing other cartoons/similar topics, or asked directly
Fuck me
In for a slow day
That's how I do it, and people still don't want me dead :D
I was reading a my little pony book on the school bus today
no one cared
^
was shit though
Swag.
MadSurge: my parents asked after I started wearing tshirts and whatnot... I wear a brony wristband everywhere...
Swag all the same.
Im sorry tv show books
See, nopony really CARES if you're a brony or not
They have interactive books in the app store
And if they don't like it they're just saying it to be assholes
Mostly aimed at children thogh
Yeah, I saw that after I talked to my friend about it, he was pretty casual.
though
PonyNegZero: my mom yells at me for still watching cartoons, but only when she's already cranky/furious at something else. My parents don't really care what I do as long as I don't get into trouble :D
Just finished reading a fanfic about chrysalis
yeah alpha it was that book
Stuff
MadSurge: kinda the same story here
but then again, I am a severe case of "0 bucks given" when I was in high school...
I want some of the toys but they never look as good as the cartoons
PonyNegZero: If I bring up that it was made by the Powerpuff Girls/Foster's Home creator they will understand :D
The hair just doesn't quite sit right with me
MadSurge: Oh, all of my friends are totally cool with it (all that have noticed it...)
And that the MLP producers encourage more men audiences.
I wish they had bracelets of all MLP characters
Alpha-Omega: if they don't exist, make them yourself
I need to find a way to make my mother make something pony related
Hey guys
...Maybe a soap statue?
PonyNegZero: also my only pony related shirts are from Shed. mov and Magic.mov, the ones with toaster-cozy Derpy and R-DASH 5000 :D
I wear this: http://derpy.me/rdOw7 everywhere
hey Fisheh_Fish hows your day been
Eh, it's just started
Great breakfast though
I have 3 tshirts, 2 belts, a wristband and a lanyard
ok Fisheh_Fish did you sleep well then
Definitely
I just need to learn how to make them
How'd you sleep?
I started an embroidery, but I accidently made it mirrored what it should have been... so I need to restart that
its afternoon hwew Fisheh_Fish
(and RD still stands on top of my right work monitor)
oh
I'm on Central Standard Time
You think a giant soap pony would sell to internets people?
Maybe
Sounds legit
StinkomanFan: that might be a hard sell...
i would buy it just cause i buy everything mlp
man the derpy plush toys go hard on ebay
PonyNegZero, hey when all you have is a hammer
yes they do
I have nothing useful to say so here's Sweetie Belle in a shoe. http://derpy.me/dLFFQ
i don't have enough money to spend on plushies
i want all the plushies
StinkomanFan: clay isn't that expensive...
I'm surprised
somebody at the con over the weekend should have asked about plushies
The handmade mlp plush toys look extremely accurate
Yeah, but I have TONS of soap scraps just lying around
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbIGnY_DSIE&feature=BFa&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ
My mom's a soapmaker soooo
StinkomanFan: well, clay will probably sell easier than soap... just saying
Who wouldn't want to rub themselves with Rainbow Dash?
In the shower
A lot of people would hate to see her dissolve...
Dang I wish I still had a job
..... I guess I'll just try to chisel things out of the wood in our backyard...

hello all!
Heya
hey BronyInstrumental hows your day been

Morning everyone
Hey Dermathil

Anybody wanna play some toribash?
hey Dermathil you sleep well
well for one thing, alexxm, i may or may not have contracted tetanus
OoOoO
BronyInstrumental: don't die, dying is bad
ouch sorry to hear that BronyInstrumental
BronyInstrumental: go get an anti-tetanus shot as soon as possible.
i'm looking into it
but it's the dumbest thing ever!
Anybody got Toribash installed?
Anti tetnis are preventers not curers
i stabber myself in the arm with a braddle in DT by accident

I scraped myself on a rusty car tire (couldn't get it off since it was rusted on...) luckily, I was up to date on my shots
Hi guys!
I know, Radish. But one preventer shot is better than no shot at all
hey Flyboy hows your day been
its been ok
Anybody wanna play some Toribash?
/me bugs BronyInstrumental sorry to hear about that
AntiTetris shots
Dermathil: ME!
/me hugs BronyInstrumental sorry to hear about that
:)
I love sucking at Toribash XD
i had a wicked bad stomach ache for the half of it though
Thats what is said
and there's also a gaping hole in my fretting arm so playing guitar hurts like a bitch
Hole?
i stabbed myself by accident
Is it big
How did we play this game again Dermathil ? :P
not big but still hurts
start the application, I'm trying to make a match
ouch BronyInstrumental sorry to hear about that
Vordox: what game?
Well now I think part of my Ds is broken
The L button broke off
SpadeMagnes[R]: don't die, dying is bad
It can go back in but the metal attached to it wont go back in with it
The button still works
Flyboy: Toribash!
most technology is not meant to last unless it's nokia
Hi folks.
My Ds is old
go look for Dermathil room
only 1 person in it
/me breaks the rules
Vordox: what tthe buck is Toribash?
Nokia N-Gage
Flyboy: A very strategic game, it's like Fighting game with Chess. :D
Dermathil: You still there?
The indistructitaco
Flyboy: one of the gloriest, most bloody fighting game simulator
Dermathil: its messy
Good afternoon everypony
I've played it and it can get REDICULACE
Vordox: you had me at 'strategic
SpadeMagnes[R]: Same here, I owns the original DS model for...idk 6, 7 years now, and the touch screen isn't working properly.
Parts fly everywhere
hey killerpony7733 hows your day been
Flyboy: http://www.toribash.com/downloads.php
DARNIT FKING BROWSER
What happened to the N64?
yeah I'm still there
yep already ion it XD
VenHur96: Mine has a chunk of its hull missing where the top part moves
alexxm: Just woke up at 5:47 AM :D
look for dermathil room
alexxm: PM
You could take a sledgehammer to that beast and it'd survive
Nintendium
will Do Derm
alright
wait... you can get weapons!?
can you design your own!?!?!?
Gameboys could withstand a nuclear blast for godsake!
Shit was tough back then
But you drop a DS and everything's gone
The GameCube. One unit was demonstrated to survive bludgeoning with bats, thrown like a ball and towed on pavement by a moving car. It still worked.
Everything
SpadeMagnes[R]: Mines is still alright besides some straches, however, like I said, the touch screen of it isn't working at times, it's all...white.
I don't know Flyboy
Get this
a guy once wrote in to Nintendo Power, saying his SNES and Super Mario World cartridge survived a fire that destroyed the rest of the house it was in!
That shit is tough
i want to make a golf club and make a move where you kick the guy to the ground and wack his head of with the golf club
I doon't know if it can be easily made
they're pretty much mods
SpadeMagnes[R]: Whoa, whoa, whoa, really? Damm, that catridge must of has been Chuck Norris in disguide.
Says on the page i have up the famicom cartidges can shrug off getting ran over by a truck
One LPer took a FIRE TO POKEMON RED
AND IT STILL WORKED
When Carlos Mencia decided to destroy a Nintendo 64 for his show Mind of Mencia, it took two strikes from a large mallet before any visible cracks formed in the case.
Seriously what the fuck did they use to build stuff back then?
Flyboy: Seems like a concept for a Mortal Kombat fatality, only you remove the golf cub and replaces with a...idk, a chainsaw or something.
SpadeMagnes[R] hell i once saw a game boy that was in the first iraq that apprently still worked
VenHur96: you replace it with the guy's arm XD
Flyboy: xD Yeah.
i has got source filmmaker thingy
...Has anyone ever tried to destroy a Wii, out of curiousity?
dont have a wii :\
Flyboy: My first Mortal Kombat game was Trilogy on the N64, never owned another MK game until I got my hands on MK9 for the PS3, Kratos inculded.
my first mortal kombat game was shaolin monks
I liked Shaolin Monks.
But now you drop a disk on the floor and it's too scratched up for anything
It was fun with a mate.
Teehee, Mate. It's funny because it implies something in the States
I like the ironic idea that Street Fighter wasn't well known from the first game, but it was the sequel, Street Fighter II, that actually made the series famous, weird...maybe it's was because of Guile?
Who wants to play rainbow dash ayyack?
I has a Wii, but never EVER wants to destroy that, or any other consoles, y'see, I been a longtime Nintendo fan, and I even owned all the consoles expect some handhelds.
attack
anyone wanna take a peek of what im drawing right now?
Is it pron?
NES, SNES, N64, Gamecube, Wii, GBA, and the DS.
That's all I has.
not porn, but a bit suggestive
I wish I had an NES
Or an Atari
Gamecube was best console
Now for my other consoles, I has an Xbox, the original, a PS1, a PS3, and a PSP. I used to has the PS2 though...
I want it as an app
Nah, the Nintendo 64 was. It revolutionized multiplayer.
WELCOME TO WARIO WORLD
Braviary: meh
i had a gameboy colour gameboy advance ps2 xbox ps3 and xbox 360
Don't you meh me, Mario Party 2 was the shit.
I have a PS2 and a PC. WHAT NOW?!
Majora's Mask is a awesome zelda game
Gamecube was the console of my childhood, Melee, Luigi's Mansion, Simpsons Road Rage, SA2 Battle, Metroid Prime 1 (and 2)...sigh, Good times.
<3 Luigi's Mansion
who's streaming?
mario sunshine
Gamecube was the console that managed to show its powers better than the other consoles at launch
Remember that Hanging Luigi easter egg?
Melee was good, but Brawl has to be my favorite SSB game. And my Luigi's Mansion broke before I beat it.
Luigi's Mansion is awesome
Oh yeah, and Mario Sunshine, couldn't forget that either, my first mario game I played...
They need to rerelease Super Mario Sunshine for the 3DS.
The first Mario game you played was Sunshine? You really picked the bottom of the barrel didn't ya.
Meanwhile, there was nothing wrong with Sunshine.
sunshiner is legit
ahh my preteen years
I like how the fact of why Chuggaaconroy don't play just games, he played games some peoples never heard of.
In the phone room for a SPLIT SECOND if you catch it Luigi's shadow in the lightening turns into his figure hanging from the ceiling
Braviary: That's a matter for debate. One that I do not feel like having.
It was kind of boring
Personally, my favorite was SM64DS. It was SM64... with Luigi!
ok guys after a long time of typing i have re writen M Little Pony Day Z is Magic
And Wario
And Yoshi
Not Waluigi though
StinkomanFan: I never seen the hanging Luigi secret, but I later found it out in a top 10. When I sawed it, my childhood wasn't the same...
Yes, but Luigi was the big one.
...ever again.
Hai
That was just a peek at how scary Nintendo could get
I remember this forum I regulared for a few years, the number of people who came asking how to unlock Waluigi (and Sonic) were astounding.
I mean, god Nintendo, I know Luigi has his own game now besides...Mario is Missing but...DANG!
VenHur96, that's not an Easter Egg, that's a glitch with the shadows.
And just as Luigi couldn't feel more sorry for himself.
Remember Eternal Darkness?
It's just a COMPLETELY FITTING glitch with the shadows.
brb
Which is why I love Luigi as my number 1 favorite Super Mario character.
who's streaming?
It's unknown if it's a glitch or an Easter Egg
>New Mario games
Nintendo couldn't be scary if they made a game avout it
>Mario gets rich
>Luigi gets traumatized
Alpha-Omega
Kirby
Marx, Zero2
back!
I heard of Eternal Darkness from Screwattack, it's this horror game with a dark storyline, at first, It seemed like another basic game, until...
The closest it could get to being real would be if Nintendo noticed the glitch and kept it in. They would not add it intentionally and be able to keep it as an E rated game.
Welcome to Carousel Boutique, may I help you? http://youtu.be/JEmjwpOuQGY
*my tv turns off, my point of view* "What the hell happens to the gam-" *gameplay comes back on* "...Mommy?"

>ALL SAVES DELETED
Weird *yay* doesn't scare me but interests me
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
He doesn't know how
It's hard to be scared by it when you know the game is screwing with you.
I <3 Kirby. That little black hole in the form of a cute pink...erh...thing.
/me throws a boot to the head of everypony in the chat
Kirby is awesome
Kirby is fun
Scary but fun
http://youtu.be/sCcmjiLdzRY Kirby is indeed awesome.
Secret butt fun.
Ha I'm immune my mom throws shoes at me. It's kind of normal
Eternal Darkness was probally made by the Trololol guy...because, y'know, game's trolling at times.
>Miss one tomb in a level
VenHur96, har har dohoho I am laughing right now

sagas: why
I know, Right?
alexxm: Remember Rainbow? This is my new account.
Freefall29: He gets annoying
fuck it im getting off i need sleep night every pony
Bet its the same...
got a some guilt on the way, but great...guess I have to compliment someone at the next opportunity
Excuse me?
Buy sneakers!

Dem stereotypes

sagas: Uncle Ruckus is funny bro
nighty Quick_Thinker
Ahm walkin' to the liquor store.
8,6they're still active, they just hide it better

/me mustn't comment the show or gets kicked again ^^
Iraq is black?
Babboon.
sagas: some parts of it. its very, very close to africa

Oooooh snap!

Freefall29: No theyre Arabic...

CELESTIA DAMN TORTURE MACHINE
THis is just pathetic
Freefall29: Yes.

Freefall29 it's BET, of course they can
ok for serious im getting off to sleep ponys night :)
Cya Quick_Thinker!
this is a broken man
Dat ass.
Just asking, can you RP as your OC?
He cant stand black porn...
It's electric torture. The guy who built it only thought of how much power to channel through the victim's body without any thought of how to manage that power.
Lol film crew.
Just keep filming
Is this the episode in which Ruckus goes to White Heaven?
sure why not
Sewercide?
XD
ok i'm back :)
No
2 million views on youtube
everyone knows reality shows are scripted
WB BronyInstrumental
DEAD.
just let him dangle
"Ruckus was here"
clearly they didn't go to harvard
i love black people...hate niggers. but love black people
the actors in these reality shows get only 250€ per day...one of 20 gets through the casting
rap music and 40oz
Are we allowed by Bronystate rules to roleplay as our OCs?
ShadowQuill: You are not allowed to rp here, period.
We can't RP here
Only maid hour
and they all dream of being discovered as actor
Meanwhile: I wasn't going there, but it is good to know.
xD
what qualifies as roleplay?
not even maid hour last I heard.
But VERYVERY VERY Lightly
When is it gonna change.
ShadowQuill: No but there are RP channels here
is this maid hour yet?
dat KKK poster6_9
BET: We Hate Black People
Is that a fucking KKK dude picture on the wall?
wait wait he is anti black?
RP channels?
this is what BET actually belives
ShadowQuill: So if you want to RP find one of the RP channels
What's an RP?
Roleplay?
BOONDOCKS was made by a black dude
killerpony7733: There's a such thing? Where are they? Just curious.
rolePlay
KNEW IT.
lol
OctaviaDashPie1797: Aye.
that is a KKK guy on the wall
BET. If its not limiting black people to rap, and other black stereotypes, its a bet.
this is easy
Link, please.
Dat profound insight.
THis is strange
Where are the RP channels?
Yeah blame the black intern
made by Aaron McGruder. WHOM IS BLACK
God damn sibligns
ShadowQuill: I can't remember the link to it, Also ask for the link in a PM not here
Sounds legit.
*siblings
lol
yeah white.....
ShadowQuill you can check by typing /list
50% white?
This is reatarded
Where are the RP channels?
obviously
sagas: oh lighten up a little bro
Status Quo is God, I guess. I was hoping for some character development.
i wanna take that test :p
Doctor is like ":|"
OctaviaDashPie1797: Type /list and find out.
8,6if you want to find an RP channel, type /list and search through the different channels

MaidSurge they have plenty of good songs
UnFoundBug: Oh right. The Johnson is a boat, which is often used for fishing, and the Wunder Boner is for fishing,.

>inb4 GH3.
:D
00,10but nah some one else is in line to stream.

UnFoundBug: unfortunately they all sound similar :|
MaidSurge you need to turn your music up then
UnFoundBug: So you can have your Johnson AND the wonder boner when you go fishing!
GENIUS
Kammerjunk ikr
Why won't you let the wonder boner die?!
oh crud im on the wrong nick :S
MaidSurge: Similar? All Dragonforce songs sound exactly the same.
Thats better
I acctually discovered this song on my sisters computer (tho she never listened to it) way before GH3 got released
Chuck Norris beats this song on expert mode...with no hands.
Meanwhile: Because every household should have a wonder boner.
i saw these live before GH3
and a johnson
Kammerjunk: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.
they are absolutely NUTS
VenHur96: Noone likes Chuck Norris jokes anymore
"They all sound the same". Is that sort of like how my parents claim that Coca Cola and Pepsi "taste exactly the same" despite that clearly not being the case? You guys telling me you're getting old already?
Chrysalis what were they like live
you gotta fish with your wonder boner on your johnson
CK|Catnap: Coca Cola and Pepsi have mostly the same chemical structure.
dat face
XD
alexxm theyre actually pretty damn amazing, one of the few bands iv seen where they are actually as good live as on CD
what was crazy is they play some of there stuff FASTER live
Chrysalis damn
Kammerjunk: That's nice. I can still tell the difference easily. :p
ikr
Chrysalis my friends think they are overrated
mosh pits to dragonforce are just crazy
Kammerjunk: Can tell the difference between the regular and decaf stuff, too.
CK|Catnap: The mind is a powerful thing, though.
Dunno what to do... continue writing, draw something, or just go to bed early...
CK|Catnap but can you tell the difference between coke and pepsi?
Draw.
SCOOT best Rock singer
Chrysalis: dat true. This song live must be quite a thing.
oh yeah
Chrysalis: Yup.
this is a really lonmg song
for the intermission they did a techno mix of this on a keytar
that thing was just out of this world
FUCK YEAH
this song is so hard to do in geuitar hero :S
WUTS DAT EPISODE
Chrysalis: It's....not hard actually. Pepsi has pretty much no flavor by comparison. >_>
feeling pinkie keep
yeah
CK|Catnap i usually find it easy to tell because pepsi has an aftertaste that coke doesnt
ooh top10 songs
don't coke and pepsi taste the same?
NO/

THEY DON'T.
No my good sir

You can tell the difference between regular and decaf Coke/Pepsi, too, if you pay attention. The decaf stuff usually triggers a headache if you drink too rapidly, and the flavor is off.

Damn good at the game.
so those kids have kinect?
NOOBS
I'm no Silverscreen, but:The Wild Gunman video game in Cafe 80's was specially made for the film. Wild Gunman was an actual light gun game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, but was never a dedicated arcade cabinet. It was, however, included in many of Nintendo's Play Choice 10 machines, hence why a lightgun was on the cabinet. The sound effects heard in the movie are from the game, but, the on screen

Then some future cilvization digs it up and remarks "In the year 2013, a wise historian named John de Lancie documentated a society of people who spread love and tolerance called Bronies." Then the future cilvilzations view it as a religion and then Bronyism becomes a cult
