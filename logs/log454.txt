dken2021

Nittany_Discord: Then we need to save it! :O
Hi everypony.
This reminds me of that TMNT episode with the mutated cows
00,10if only they had some way to cut the power to the electric trains
Nittany_Discord: did you say...beer???????
why would automate a train carrying toxic chemicals
hai Bobeh@
LOL!
hi Bobeh
stupid adds
Sumica: do u have like all 4 seasons?
Code Lyoko? I used to love this show.
I haven't seen this in a while.

Bobeh: same
00,10flutterfriend, get adblock+

Sumica: It'd still take them miles to stop without breaks.
John Swamp
these guys have REALLY big heads
is the best name
00,10yes Alicorn_Prince_Shane
Sumica: they probably would if only it didnt make too much sense
---> fallout
Trainobyl
This reminds me of a stereo typical math problem
Swamp , Quagmire , giggity ?
the only episode i remember is the one where the school gets buried
Om: Yeah, only in the maths problem they're not on a head-on collision course. :D
The only one I remember is the one where he wins the lottery
Sumica: after this ep can u plz show the first ep of the series
hai Bobeh
GilDash: Yes, well adds a bit of ecitement to it.
kids are mean.
I hate word problems, too much thinking and less math solving
00,10electric trains have break systems that are engaged when the power is lost.
Om: That's terrible. :D
GilDash: Pluss then you can calculate the fallout.
troll!
lol
ewwww
Sumica: Huh, I never knew.
what a gemdog
Om: That's grim. :D
lol
he called me a muuuuuuule
GilDash: I suppose.

That keyboard is quite large.
His computer is an elf.
Airpuff: the one with the crown?
dat ultimate nerd
Niiiiice.
she never notices anything.
She bloody never notices anything.
Irish_Pony: crown? o.o
shut their mobiles off? do people say that?
Brits.
Irish_Pony: shes got a helmet.. though xD
00,10another fun fact about trains is they can be prevented from moving with a hand full of pennys
Airpuff: Thats what i ment :P
how dark.
WHAT A WHORE
flutter_spin: I prefer "gone silent". :D
AHHH
she's a dog murderer
Irish_Pony: ahaha okai xD
Shut there satelite tele-mc-phones~
SHE'S SUCH A BIIIIITCH
Sissi :[
:(
11,02That's true, the engineer must keep his hand/foot on the brake otherwise the train comes to a halt.
poor kids
their*
whoa, fifteen minutes
11,02switch*
such a long time
Sumica: Because they just keep spinning their wheels, right? Coins can't derail a train though.
the first time i saw this after my childhood was on the stream from Sumica
no pets!
00,10no I meen if the train is not moving GilDash
ugly pet > not a loss
11,01This is why you don't automate things.
:'( no pets!?!?!!?
woot
WHAT
A
WHOOOOOOOOORE
Massive forehead.
ugly kid > should die in a hole
11,01Too bad it's too late for customer service.
jk that's mean.
11,01I hate automated answering services.
00,10take and put a penny infront and behind each wheel on the head unit the train cant move
Irish_Pony: Is that yours?~
Nyria: which one?
OH MY GOD
noooo flutterfriend wants pets! :`(
dat chaos
not sure why are they worrying, they got time travel on their hands
lol Sumica
I THOUGHT THE CHAIR WAS PART OF HIS HEAD
00,10they cant lift their own weight, they can only pull it
11,01Just go back in time.
Irish_Pony: Well the profile~
Sumica: Yeah. I've seen a demonstration where a train ran over many pennies on a track, so I knew that wasn't the case. But I supposed it wouldn't have the traction needed, seeming as it's steel on steel.
dat looting
/me loots
:'(
SO I THOUGHT HE HAD A PONYTAIL
of course.
Nyria: eyup...
Epic loots!
now she sees it.
00,10the engin is too heavy for it to lift
we need to watch angel beats! :)
immmmmmmmediate departure
maybe if she did her freakin' job instead of sitting around on her ass all day.
flutterfriend: i agree
what does she do when they aren't talking to her?
she obviously isn't looking for towers...
bad timing
but really, what a fugly dog
ooh, they have trading cards
airpuff lets suggest angel beats for next time
PinkiePieFTW: What do regular security guards do according to the movies? :D
/me 11,01plays synth theme song

PinkiePieFTW: she lives in lyoko so idk
>alarm set for 8:30

Meryl: You'd never risk it. :D
inb4 they get to the tower and everything gets back to normal.
hey! no phones!
Phase4: Impressive. :D

"I need to go to the bathroom"

11,01Don't you remember when you could play games when /you/ wanted to?
stupid gym teachers :P
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pey7f/ Why not zoidberg?
Nittany_Discord: No. :D
how could she not see that.
Why does this remind me of Blue Dragon?
Don't stand there. Run!
Dat luck
GROUNDBREAKING COMPUTER GRAPHICS!
yeah wasting time
00,10was that an ed edd and eddy comic book?
I just saw Fap in that comic "Tihi"
absolutely stupid kids
11,01GilDash: Yeah. You didn't have to have internet or anything.
Nope Baman
Rave|Happy: Don't worry...be happy.... why are you happy?
Nittany: Apparently Blizzard's fans do not. I've been arguing with several people who seem convinced that Diablo 2's offline single player was also on Battle.net, and it was also totally hackable.
Indeed
It was Batpan!
NO SHIT
Nittany_Discord: I had it from a very young age fortunately. I remember dial-up and everything. :D
IT'S CODE LYOKO
very clever
always one step ahead
Jim, you ain't bright
ffs, just use the 3G connection on your phone to connect :@
lol
blakka blakka hai hai hai
00,10every thing is hackable so long as you let the user touch it
oh poo dosent life suck for him?

Dken2021: I am
11,01I was being sarcastic GilDash
Hi everypony
Dunna nunna nunna nunna nunna nunna BATPAN
/me wishes he was drunk right now...
Oh hai Midnight_Splendor
I just saw the dogs anus and balls. WHY THE FUCK HAS THIS GENERATION SCREWED MY MIND?
the anime is horible
Nittany_Discord: well i stole your face!
hello~
Nittany_Discord: Sark and internet don't always mix. :D
I LOVED THIS SHOW
So I'm sort of sitting here thinking "wow that requires such a level of dumb that I can't appreciate it properly".
lol Midnight_Splendor
hes blind!
i mean Midnight_Tempest
Nyria I see what you did there!
nice reflexes samurai.....
this show is so dumb.
LLLLLAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGG
11,01CK|Ded: Sucks to be them.
why do i like it?
00,10yumi still sucks
This is actually a pretty cool show, too bad they canceled it in my area after only a few episodes. (In my area, the channel was removed):(
omg its star wars
this show is so entertaining
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: you tab fail so hard...
oh crappy animators lol
Hey everypony!! :)
They said the Companion Cube couldn't attack me :(
/me smacks PinkiePieFTW
/me 11,01loses points
What show's on?
O hai Rave|Happy
WE NEED A HEALER
/me pokes Midnight_Tempest
Quickly! Activate your trap card~
treating this as video game :P
Hey Rave|Happy
"Code Lyoko"
/me likes to be smacked
/me explodes
So heroic.
Sumica: I suppose one could "hack" a person's Diablo 2 offline files by hacking their computer and manually stealing the files. I suppose that pigs jumping out of a window are also technically flying for a short span of time.
/me contains Midnight_Tempest s explosion
the trifecta!
how do you lose life points when you block every attack?
/me makes fun of the crappy animation
/me joins flutterfriend
GROUNDBREAKING COMPUTER GRAPHICS!
coool
Cheap
11,01It's a lot harder to hack SP accounts when they're offline.
Aren't all of these blaster noises from Star Wars?
I have to go do homework
:c
GilDash: would think so -.-
byebye
Tootaloo Meryl~
Lol
Hey, sometimes the cheap 'fall apart' graphics is better than the 'big explosion'
i wait, fuck off bro. - Dog to guy:D
yes pinkiepieftw as groundbreaking as a pebble
lol his name is a pun.
GilDash: I said that yesterday
Bai Meryl
Jim: ur on tv
Airpuff: I think the credits do make mention of Skywalker Sound, so...
Bronysith: Nowai
Nittany: it's also pointless to do when hacking Battle.net is a thousand times easier.

Oh look, those tiny enemies that are in EVERY EPISODE
Plus he'd be assured to take out the columns in one shot, this plan requires ramming repeatedly into the columns which gives them time to get to the tower. Ergo, bad plan is still kind of bad.

TheRainbowDash: why? xD
00,10so falling damage is bad
What tha hell is this...it looks weird.
dat cannon fodder
they will rematerialize her.
11,01Here we go.
Bronysith: That's what I keep asking.
obviously
she falls in.
13Bronysith: i don't think they ever explain it, but it's a common pattern that once someone's booted out, they don't get to go back in
CK|Ded: no.. he's not... (not in the real life)
13until the reset buttom
11,01He'll have to use that program.
Airpuff: I don't like Dash shipping, only the R34 stuff....:F
Yes, look at YOUR SHAPE! YOUR FOREHEAD IS HUUUUUUGE
:D
Falling damage in my platformer? Hell no.
they use the one-time program to rematerialize her
cause if they had a day of no xana attack?
Even in that state he is better than Umi >.>
Dat ball monster
Derezing
WAHT A TWIST!
Lambo: LOLq
Shizuka: but why not? is there a cool down lol
GilDash: Im gonna take a nap in my barrel...care to join me? ;)

You know, if you take away the video and only listen to it.... it sounds a lot.... well, *blushes*
The ball of doom.
NO ONE SAW IT COMING!

Irish_Pony: How can I refuse an offer like that? ;)
Wow, a giant ball enemy, I did NOT expect that :P
00,10ever notice odd's second sight is always half right
Airpuff: Somehow....
13Bronysith: possibly, it's at least established that they do feel, ish, the pain of whatever killed them
these guys
they all wear the exact same clothes everyday
Lasers are very dangerous kids.
i think i managed to understand how to use that machine
LAZAHS
11,01That ball is back.

So much TIE fighter... :D
Acids and bases are more dangerous than lasers
00,10sounds like angry sex again
MATRIX
Nittany_Discord: I see wut you did there
/me dropped the base earlier
Oh my, slow motion time.
If Aelita dies, shes dead for good right?

Well your boned.....

Lambo: a evil ai called xana who is trying to take over the real world

Jesus took 3 days to respawn, Damn Lag

i hate you all!
GilDash: what?! xD
Sumica: Why are they so worried, shell just come back
Airpuff: I didn't even touch you that time.
Anyway.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
if they fall into the sea, they die, for reals
00,10Aelita needs so save pasword and username
13remotely kill them in case of a fall like that
IM GONNA GET JCAAA, oh shit i missed
This series is lame
TheRainbowDash I've been better
MY BAD
/me hops into Irish_Pony's barrel.
/me stares at GilDash "Do not question a god!" D=
Dken2021: i think they get stuck in the lyoko world
Let's play some Banjoo kaazooie or watch some Ponies
I like how Jeremy's lips moved but he didn't say squat
Ryanier128: Oh, good to hear. I am doing good myself.
Lambo: DONT ASK FOR PONIES
Back to the past? he say?
Having forgone shenanigans for some time, t'is about time for more.
yep ck
pfft Airpuff isnt a god
Recycle Bin/
Dat recycled footage
Lambo: PONIES
?
00,10good thing they have the one time use program
Airpuff: I don't seem to recall any reprecussions for doing so.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: im a god-god
what are we watching?
GarrettBrony: Pretty fast if you think about the fact that there was no Internet back then
but not now interupting a show is rude
he's really going to think about it.
.....so?
She died, shouldnt she be sent back Sumi?
/me 11,01knew this would happen
what an ass.
CupcakeWarrior: she is still falling
WOAH
mmhmm
no
wait what? return to the past didn't renew Yumi?
LOL
You can only run a program once!
GilDash: im so complex you cannot comprehend! D=
One and only one. WOAH
/me 11,01is sad
/me noms on GilDash's mane
Why is this a decision?
No copy paste?
00,10they are outside time loops as they are at teh focal point
Yumi is dead, Aelita isn't
its the use once time scroll :P
ck|ded, that's what i'm saying!
Airpuff: Oh, I know you all too well. ;)
shit was fast
:'(
why did he even have to think?
srsly Jeremie x Aelita
didn't use MySQL
So, they actually die every time they go into the machine?
/me does the Time Wrap (Again)
Youll be okay... you only died
woot
00,10Jearmy has so much blue balls
lol
good news is, jeremie always has his right hand.
I'M EXPRESSING MY FEELINGS IN DIALOGUE.
The thing is with this kind of dematerializing is, that when you get out, you are not the same fucking person - you are just an exact copy!!!
/me kisses Irish_Pony.
lol PinkiePieFTW
So they actually die
Obsidian: only minjor brain dmg and a partially thrown up heart but ur fine
now he can jerk off
Sumica: lol
MANY EPISODES LATER
13presumably it has to do with the stored profiles of their real and virtual selves, you have to keep spiritual continuity
At least she comes to the real world at the end of this season
Lambo: so it's like beaming?
/me walks over to GarrettBrony and says "slap my hand"!
omg rape
xD
*sarcasm* well THAT wasn't scripted
candy genius is best genius
Hahahaha
dat candy
here's your condom
Candy can fix anything.
11,01I hate these kind of stories.
true.
Iknowwhat he should do. He should continually spill candy onto the key board until he gets it right
Can O.o dy
Shizuka: i just dont get the show. still good
Now get in the van
00,10and then he choked and died
Uakh: XDDD

And then he choked to death on the candy
... dat incoming rape-feeling
Sumica: :D
Meanwhile: xD
why does this show exist.
/me slaps DiscordsMaker 's hand
Suddenly credits
Now lets watch some pony
Wait, that ended? :D
13like i said, season 1 is weak compared to the rest, they were still finding their niche, establishing the mechanics and whatnot
or whatever
Airpuff: soo right
PinkiePieFTW: cause its awesome
YES!
*yay*
YES!
WOOOT
i like this preview

hello Canadian_Brony
11,01Volcano!
Derpy_Hooves: Can you give me a muffin?
but urine is produced as well, not completely based on the amount of water you drink, it's a filtration for your body so it always happens

if you happen to drink a lot of soda though, it stretches a bladder
not really ll
03also ow, my fricking neck hurt
03s
cool...
For sages, they aren't particularly adept.
Funfact: momo was originally planned to be the reincarnation of Monk Gyatso, but they ultimately scrapped the idea before revealing it.
03from how I was sleeping
03or something
NOPE
nope.avi
RAWRity: hmmm interesting
Canadian_Brony really? I just randomly made it up one day
not when sex and suggestive topics seem discussed quite often
Nikoooo my cousin!
huehuehue
Derpy_Hooves: Well... then I'm not gonna tell you the secret of the Soul Reaver
FlareChaser: lets go bowling
so don't even start when it's something legitimately important
03inb4 saturation saturation
Bronysith: okay...
dat anti-fire racism
Chukata chukata chuk chuk chukuta
YOu can actually see some of that when you watch Momo's actions. Often times he acts like a tacit mentor/source of comfort to Aang, especially in the first season.
O_O
03OK anyway though
goddam it stream
03I guess what I don't get is like, I'm not drinking anything in my sleep (obviously) so why do I have to keep getting up to pee
anyways drf, tl;Dr soda has serious effects on bladder
RAWRity: hmmm do you think that's still a plausible theory?
just saying
because
00,10avatar roku was good at mine craft it seems
FINALLY
legacyofvrak: WHAT?! FINALLY!
its what you drink during the day
Ryanier128 huh, really? If that's so, then I would ask you not to use it anywhere else. I made it up about 8 years ago
rite?
urine is not based on water content
Can firebenders bend Magma and Lava?
/me is bored
NOW.... TO PLAY IT!
Sumica: and yet he couldn't stop the ultimate creeper: Sozin
I think magma and lava is more earth than fire.
Bowser's getting very lazy in his design
....Octavia time? Octavia time.
RAWRity: makes you think about when King Bumi says "you're missing a very important member of your group... where's Momo?"
/me 11,01chases FlareChaser
goodbye fillies
/me runs from Nittany_Discord
Canadian_Brony okay, this is the only place I use it
Bai legacyofvrak
Or perhaps too little like either.
it's a filtration, it'll be produced as you sleep or awake
bawk
OmegaMetroidBrony: I think that the earth benders area of expertise
FlareChaser: Yes :D
00,10well to be fair no one ever knows when a creeper is sneaking up on them till itsssssssssssssss to late
11,01At least you're not bored.

He's a double traitor! Totally calling it.

O hey Woodenfan well it seems ya'll like it here.
Do not get covered in the repulsion gel.
Sumica: Crap.....I forgot you had wings....
/me 11,01gets covered
Twi pain count 4
dammit, poor twi
Twi is so derp.:D
00,10lol
celestia died lol
Weeeeee
!lol@!
do not get covered by repulion gel... best instructions ever
RAWRity: I'm not asking for her to be a main character, just a little bit more frequently recurring
the lady still Lent him money even though he's clearly stupid
This is a nice one.
/me want's a Portal Gun
That's like saying Bumi is "underrated" in avatar, simply because he isn't in every episode. Or that Harle Quinn was "underrated" in B:TAS
aww dis turret
she has a pet turret?
this is such a cute video
is the new one actually out yet?
lol cute
that squee
11,01Squee
of course she does
anypony notice how cute fluttershys squeak is?
A pet turret? I'm afraid it'll shoot me.
Where's the stream at?
fluttershy's sqeak is getting annoying actually
way too much used
Refresh Woodenfan
ok
RAWRity: no it's not, I recognize when you've got to conserve a character's screentime, like Bluto in Animal House, but Luna IS underrated
dat logic
dat Portal flash in background.
Sounds like a plan Fluttershy.
Through the window?
oh yah I love this one
Nice.
so cute
hang on brb
Woodenfan: SO cute
fluttershy has hacks
lol forever alone
11,01Flutterhacker.
/me dies
HAX! *throws computer monitor*
surprise!
awww her face
Luna is the only pony not of the Mane 6, CMC, or SPike to have HER OWN EPISODE. She is easily the MOST represented supporting character, having more combind screen time than Zecora, who actually lives within walking distance of ponyville.
FlareChaser|Octavia why?
Nittany_Discord: More like fluttercry.
aaawww
Awwww
tso obvi
D'awwwww....
INSULINE!
DAT PINK PORTAL GUN
DO WANT
omg.. thats... adorable
/me revives FlareChaser|Octavia in a pagan ritual
Dat Flarity
awwwww . . .

/me dies again

Aww
YAAAY

00,10still need a rarity ep
/me revives FlareChaser|Octavia
OMG OMG OMG
And then more Avatar.
RAWRity: welllllll that's debateable
avatards! assemble!
Sumica: nah its ok
You want more Luna? that's fine. But she's by no means "underated, or underrepresented"
Mineturtle Says Hello *Explotion*
i never saw the last episode
I miss winter solstice pt 2?
she might be a supporting character, but that doesnt mean they automatically get minimal screen time. she gets less screen time then the other supporting characters
i miss this show
i miss the movie.
previously on avatar.............
it was a pretty good movie.
but the nex series is good and based for an older demographic
I miss
luna has only 1 episode. spike has had about 3 so far, cutie mark crusders about 3.. and so on
RAWRity: but you can get where we're coming from, right? I can respect your opinion if your respect mine.
Good TV
like naruto whats it called
I missed it, I missed avatar rokou kicking ass :)
anyone agree? I found it suprisingly faithful to the source material.
Great. I come back in time for the end of the pony segment
screw the 2010 movie! watch the show!
Great I got kicked yet my screen name stayed logged in.

WallDives: SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH D:
oh nvm
Um, let me see if I can explain. Haruka hit Naota on the head with her guitar which opened an intermensional gateway within his skull called N O. His brain is on the other side of the gateway, on a planet far away, which is sending robots through. That's why they come out of Naota's forehead.
omg hi SunderlandPony89 im great you?!!

It's all a matter of building up a tolerance to spicy food. I started putting Taco Bell's mild sauce on my chicken patties. It was hot at first, then I got used to it. I moved on to Hot, and later Fire.
I had squid before, it's kinda rubbery
The curry's shape. O_O

FAKE? Just like Rarity's eyelashes?

GilDash: ...............................oh really?
mario_pony: Panty and Stalking With Garterbelt
She's actually kinda small.
0,14TheGreatAndPowerfulT, you just saw episode 3 of my second favorite anime ever
now if she just plays teacher

WallDives: I'm not being charged with psychological related offences. :)
GilDash: Never heard it said that way, you are a writeing nerd.
Thanks for moving Fleur
/me 11,01is fake
RAWRity: ...............hawt?
GilDash: I am NOT saying one way or the other. I'm just...observing.
FLCLPretender: I see why you like this anime so much
75% done
00,10I prefer if they play nurse
I got a question. Besides "Satan Pit" and "Blink", what other awesome Dr. Who episodes (one or two) should I watch to get a more feel of how Doctor Who talks and moves
GilDash this is what I think of when Neomoari hits something with her guitar. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce_PIZ_8bXg
GilDash: I know but that was a lot of elipses in a ro
do like this song
w
I demand elipsis of two-and-a-half dots length.
11,01Maids are better.
0,14Good music + good animation + funny story
FLCLPretender you sure is not called LSD ?
The glasses are fake..........just like Rarity's eyelashes
0,14very sure
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... better GilDash ?
Om: I have a particularly good grasp of punctuation; like the semi-colon.
Another?
00,10alrightnow you are gonna get so much random you wont know what hit you.
FLCLPretender, what story?
Bring it on.
my body is ready
Incoming Last Ep!
0,14there's a story to FLCL, GabeMoist
rand(infinity);
Any other Dr. Who awesome eps?
GilDash: I see. Facinating.
0,14you just have to kinda look for it
0,14:3
I never figured out what it was
I've watched Pani poni dash and bo bo bo, i'm used to random
People seem to think FLCL is "random". It's not.
0,14oh man, that ep
Om: Sometimes - in rare cases - I'll even uses dashes just because I'm bored of commas. :)
XD
GilDash: you have a great grasp of punctuation, except for that there's no hyphen in semicolon
woot
0,14I loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove the song at the end of Full Swing
LOL
0,14Crazy Sunshine
dat Excel Saga
I think that's ironic on several levels
GilDash: That makes me pause while reading it in my head.
CRISIS CITY UGGGGGH
GilDash: Are you now messing around using the freakin' puctuation marks?!
hey Sumica do you have any of the "Tales of" animes ?
this song has the best lyrics.
Om: That's the idea behind punctuation. ;)
as JesuOtaku said in her review, "Random" just means doing something crazy and then making sure you never do it again. FLCL is DELIBERATE and CALCULATING in its weirdness.
you do realize that I really like that Lyra seapony on thhe lower left right?
:( yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
00,10never heard of it
GilDash: so we will discuss this more to-morrow?
/me coughs
I take it we aren't watching 26? :3
Dat cough
Ninjazz: I'm just explaining how I enjoy correctly applied punctuation.
I never watched Excel Saga
GilDash: I suppose. Well later then I guna go take a shower.

On a scale of one to ten, RAWRity, just how serious is this anime?
there is no fourth wall in this series
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: roflmao!!
I'm generalizing Sumica, I was never a fan of anime.
Is this a show where NOTHING makes sense?
When he finds out about this, his punishment for the kid responsible: Get him to photoshop him into his own, personal porn collection.
well it is popular there Woodenfan
hell, I'm not sure there's even a third

Kill the creator of the manga the show is based off!
Not my anime and manga, those bastards
here we go again
see, this is why I like tohoku-ben. the voices are TOLERABLE.
Heh
lol
In GTO, Onizuka essentially tells the kids "If school is seriously making you unhappy, or you think it's turning you into a bad person, then FUCK the establishment. It's more important to be a good person."
save the artist, save the world
O.o
:D
HAHHAHA
oh god my head
0,14...she crazy
That artist is the one that created the manga this anime is based of.
that's one way to self-insert yourself

That girl needs therapy.
Dat english-ish
SQUEAKY FLOORY
dat engrish.
11,01This is more odd than FLCL.
spongebob feet
hen3ry: that's why she sounds familiar
Oh, I see. That's what they meant by pushing the envelope.
and considering the tales I've heard from japanese schools, I'd say that's an important lesson to put out there.
so is he drawing his own death?
well at least she isn't friends with Higurashi
He's drawing manga ponies
WallDives Kandarihu......Ok, but he didn't die 3 TIMES, like this girl!!

Dark92Enigma: it isnt Marvel. Death is a revolving door there.
Remorse!
what the hell are you.. hahaha
Nittany_Discord: that's because FLCL had a story they wanted to tell in a weird way. Excel Saga is basically an exercise in trying to give TV cencors ulcers.

GarrettBrony: Honest statement here. if you try to learn japanese legit, you will have to unlearn a lot of shit.
I'd love to see a manga/anime where the artist decides everyone's fate in the show itself. Like the Neverending story, ya know?
I like both Sumi
