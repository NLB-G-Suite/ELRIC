02*insert some reason here*
first time ever i get picked
what the hay man. what the hay

i'm like the reverse, that was my first time at the lottery
which one did you pick?
10hmmm
10that's too bad
sonic rainboom
LOL
i would have picked that one anyway
really
mostly to see what people would say at the beginning with fluttershy
02Lol
02What, you were really considering it? .-.
it's clearly the best episode
not only because of yay
that too
oh yeah, and the a movie choice sucks :P
i honestly can't tell which one is supposed to be the A movie
tboth look B to me
evil dead is a parody of bad films (so is black dynamite), across the universe is just sappy shit
02That makes sense
12hmm
thankfully it's at the end, so i'll either leave or make fun of it
02And my computer isn't doing any better with anything right now
then again, we make fun of good movies as well
12What about a game of TF2? XD
^
bronystate is all about making fun of things
02I don't have it

06And night everyone who says night to me or themselves. lol
there?
10niiight
02I don't get it
12I had to turn off some background programs and install some more ram to be able to play it. In other words, I can now play it if I want (I think) XD
02How would me being used to a crazy framerate have anything to do with my computer?
10how do you install more ram
02You use magnets
easily lol
12It's actally rather easy, you just need to buy same somewhere
desktop or laptop?
12Actually* Some*
Feather
http://www.downloadmoreram.com/
you need to know what kind to get too, but that's generally not hard to find out
/me hides
lol
02I wish more people were excited about Legend of Korra :<
12I used to have 1.5gb of ram, now I have 2gb ram

Did you know that passing kidney stones is more painful than giving birth?
I've passed 2.
I dunno.I never had a kidney stone.
You don't want them.
Is there an age you need to have kidney stones?Just askin.
No.
Oh.
I blame the local water for my only two.
12o-O
The water's so hard here, you could probably shatter glass with it.
That's why I avoid drinking it at all costs.
I stopped passing stones when I stopped drinking the local water.
03just saw the final Harry Potter
I say that 'cause i'm 12.(close to 13 mind you)
*in Shatner voice*WATEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!
Where ARE you anyways?
Is that a good thing?
12was justin bieber in it?
O.o
DRF
LOL!

03and no I didn't cry
03also, EW OWNERSHIP SCRIPTS
U sucks

LOL
03well
State College, PA.
03I ALMOST cried tears of joy when they took back the castle
In a valley.

Yay :D
03but I didn't
Now back to watching Rio
/me is owned by Kosoveon for 9 days and two miliseconds
03you know what's crazy though
03...EW RIO
03anyway
xD
Weeks ago?
Yeah
Yeah.
03that scene where they see all the dead bodies after the battle with all the death eaters
03I swear I've seen it before, even though I haven't
okays :>
03so it must have been really good description in the book
03XD
They changed a few things
03yes I'm aware ZXD
03-Z
I've hired Black Dynamite to kick their asses.He's on the way to their HQ as we speak.
Sadly
04nice drf
04and sadly? No, I like some of the changes
But the snake lols
03LOL I just failed at Mario Party
I didn't care
DRF fails at all parties ;P
04Like what happened with the destruction of the cup horcrux
03my friend and I both died in like a millisecond
04XD
03what happened in the book? I forget
Well, if you read further, Adult Swim went brony.
For a bit
ORLY?
It was in Eq.D.
Oh.Now i remember!
/me hasn't seen HP7 part 2 yet
Haters gonna hate, and then they get curious...
03I jut saw it in IMAX
03~45 minute drive each way but so worth it
03plus an hour of waiting in line
03etc
03I've been gone sincd 3
03(it's 9PM here)
03*since
03and now my friend and I are just playing Mario Party
03well, MP2 to be precise o.o
03just saw HP7.2 in IMAX
I'm about to
I'm on my way now
03oh
03nice
03see if you can film the IMAX intro while you;'re at it :P
03(which is fine, there's not much to see LOL)
nope
and banned from it
I'm only filming the intro
its awesome hurr
03Like, the thing that shows off the IMAX projection
Granted that's bad too, but not as much
03I got away with it
03it looks natural XD
what happens then?
On my way to the train
Wheee
03o.o
03WUT.
03train? o.o
They become bronies.
03our IMAX put decorations up all over
03tgo make it look like Hogwarts
03I got pictures
03remind me later XD
Or neutrals.
But I lean towardy bronyism.
makes sense
after all this is the final Harry Potter movie
And my side pain is going away.
so I can see why they would do something big
03well
03they had the same decorations for 6 and 7.1 too
03they're basically little flags with the 4 houses that hang down from the light fixtures
Bronyism:Cures side pain.Take THAT Next Wave!
03they also have a banner with the crest(?) of Hogwarts
MSN had an article about the Harry Potter movies recently
dealing with what they called "post Potter depression"
Il come back in a bit, waiting for the train
Link plz?
it was a few weeks ago
it gave suggestions for how die-hard Potter fans can deal with this
03LOL fail
Hia
hello
Emo Potter
my advice: write HP fanfiction
11Allo.
Read the books over and over again
03LOL fanfiction
that too
03my advice:"don't become so fricking addicted to something
How are you, Silver?
11Beh, annoyed.
O.o I write FF's, Danny
Ohai.
it was suggestions of alternate series to follow
that kinda hurts
or alternate movies to watch
03I said LOL fanfiction
03not ew
11Hi, Destructor.
Hm
Hey Silver.
11hi, Dari.

Holy crap! Silver is around!
/me 7blinks.

7Ah, fanfics.
03well I'll kindly disagree.

03I actually gave BW anime a try
03Ash acts like he's 2
03I'm like... nope.
12again
11I heard the zombie series is fucked up...
12:P
to me its been garbage since the end of the fifth season
His movie was cool, and the last game he was was good.
03I liked it til Battle Fronteir
03again, Veronical Taylor or GTFO
03-l
11which movie?
He commits suicide in an alternate Marvel universe.
I tried Diamond and Pearl but hated Dawn along with seeing a great deal of staleness

I tried Black and White but again, same story
The 2000 version.
/me 7pokes Feather.

I haven't seen Warzone.
03haha I just cheated at a minigame
03YAY TURBO BUTTON?
Silverscreen: *brohoof*
Yay!
11Warzone is shit. And I don't even have to watch it to see.
Advanced Generation I also tried but aside from a few episodes I can't stand it either
11to know, not see.
BONER.BONER BONER.
11BONER
ERECT PENIS.
03I liked AG
11XD
11I'm laughing.
03because unlike you I don't ONLY care about Misty
Another A-movie idea: The Punisher.
Also, why are they rebooting Spider Man?
11Boner.
The last trilogy was good.
I think Hollywood is just out of ideas now.
those are trash
and DP
Paul. >>
Kanto, I liked so much I got all three US DVD sets
Orange Islands, same story
Or are just playing it safe by not being innovative.
03I have all the DVD sets of all the Pokémon anime, even tghe crappy new ones x.x
11Because they fucked up the third movie too much.
@Next Wave:Bronyism.It cures side pain.Take THAT Next Wave!
Like the gaming industry.
Johto, got those sets too
11Even though all they had to do was bring Venom back and BAM!
I can't justify the purchase of box sets for later seasons
11I watched that show.
03you got the crappy telecined sets
03but w/e
THOSE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE NOT FREAKING RARE
SciFi Channel:Because poor literacy is kewl!
11It was good for a quick laugh and enjoyable.
seriously $120 for just THREE EPISODES!?
no thanks
that is a MAJOR rip off
Next Wave?
MFW it's possible to run out of ideas when you can do absolutely anything in a film/game.
11agreed, Linkara.
oo
11those original movies were SHIT
MFW AAA industries are mainly profit-driven.
ALAN MOORE FTW.
When you care mostly about money, you don't want to take risks.
the region 4 PAL sets are a great deal easier to obtain
11I think Watchmen is overrated...
12o-o
So you don't ask for new IPs because they are risks.
11but that's my opinion.
11...
because unlike Viz, Magna Pacific actually is consistent with releasing things
11Sexual misadventures...
You just keep milking the ones you have.
That's why CoD is yearly, and that's why Halo is being re-booted.
Lost Girls:It's clopfics,just without ponies.
03well I'd rather pay more to get properly encoded stuff
03as EW MOTION BLUR
03and I have all the Johto NTSC stuff, I already offered to send you copies P
03*:P
11 95 fucking bucks?! o.O
Except Kotick is just a greedy bastard that admitted years ago to yearly IP exploitation.
HAUNTED VAG TIME!
I want to have legit copies of as much as I ccan get
*can
and besides, you got royally ripped off
dari http://www.petitiononline.com/p1nk13pi/petition.html
11Catwoman + big Boobs = win.
11<.<
by the price gougers of eBay
03actually not really
03a good half of them I got at the list price of $14.99 each
Aggred Silverscreen.
03from a store that had a huge surplu
03s
03there were only a couple I had to spend triple digits on and hence why it took me so long to get them all
11your vagina is haunted.
this is why I did not get the Master Quest sets from the US
11i'm laughing so hard.
price gouging
and scalping
My day has been made.Thank you Linkara.
Seems like a good idea.
Haunted vags are even worst than Candy vags.
03see
But I'm wondering, has a petition ever actually worked?
03the Master quest sets I bought from a brick and mortar store for $30 each
03now
11Candy vag is good vag.
11...did I say that out loud? <.<
I think so
No harm in trying I suppose.
03I'd like to replace mine as they're getting a little scratched up
03if you want them I can give you mine XD
Edible vag?
Vag?
03and replace my sets
Oh nvm
you would have to get the discs resurfaced
03no
NWM
03they aren't that badc
*NVM
03-c
03the yall work fine
03just minor scratches
I know what it is.
if you did that and they skip on ANY DVD player I have
they are coming right back
HAPPY GUN?REALLY?
03they're in good enough condition that DVD Decrypter rips them without giving any errors.
03That's all I cna say, really
03*can
Wow 2750 signatures, that's good.
plus I already have the region 4 PAL Master Quest set
mhm
and a DVD player that works with them
Bye everyone.Enjoy the line-up that i posted.
I go to bed now.
You think haunted vags are bad, try a vagina dentata
03well whatever you want
03I wanna see if I can get them for a reasonable price
03like, I just made a major profitable find
03the score from the first Transformers movie
03is uber rare and out of print
03to get it from Amazon.com or Amazon.de is like $200+ toi get it new
03and it's not even on ebay
Yeah.
03well Amazon japan has the "US Import" BRAND NEW in stock for about $19
03so I just bought 5 of them
03with shipping it's like $120
03imagine if I sell them at $50 each, keeping one for me...
I don't have money to burn so the common stuff is fine for DVD sets
I'm hoping maybe they'll make a white Celestia, someone at the MLP convention even said to an employee that she was paying $100 for an artist to paint it white.
But apparently "pink ponies sell better". :/
11LINKARA WANTS AN ANSWER!
yeah pink celestia bugs me too
we got one pony set the other day, it came with spike too
I also have an MLP backpack :P
11oh god.
7!scramble
Scrambled word is "teoluoscmrce". To guess at what the word is type !guess (Your guess here). Type !hint, !hint2 or !hint3 for a hint.
7!hint3
The first four letters of the current word are "occl"
11Abe Lincoln, Vampire Hunter.
11They're making a movie of it.
LOL
You serious?
11Yes, serious.

Woah, you've got a Spike?

XD
!digimon

Sorry that isn't right! Keep trying!
11ha. he no like Hulk 03. :D
:P
!digimon
yeah it's like a small figurine set
This chat makes me want to play The Punisher.
11...
Go through the game on hard.
7!endscram
Ended the current game. Word was "occlusometer". Better luck next time.
It's a pretty good game.
Also, the backpack's awesome (yay, it has ponies), though I'm not sure I can pull off that look. :P
there is a twilight and an applejack too I can't remember the others though....one min I'll look
7Well, didn't get the first part. o.O
7!scramble
11the stuff they left out of Watchmen was NOT that big of a deal, IMO.
Scrambled word is "imahemoprg". To guess at what the word is type !guess (Your guess here). Type !hint, !hint2 or !hint3 for a hint.
7!hint3
The first four letters of the current word are "mime"
7!guess mimeograph
it has spike, twilight, applejack, pinkie pie, and (pink) celestia
11It focused on characters that had nothing to do with the plot, and for a movie that's only an hour and a half long, the plot gets priority over trivial side-plots.
amazing
I have the ORIGINAL AAA cell that would have come with Pokemon Pinball in the package
11SUPPER EFFECT! :D
its date code says June 1999
and that is not all
11Good comic.
Awesome.
03!pokemon

03yeah all the digimon names sound the same to me
03I wouldn't be surprised if "fakemon" was a legit nam9e XD
03-9
Bakemon exists
he's a ghost
First person in line ftw
And only half an hour til show time
Whoop
LOL
I misread as "Hour and a half"
03LOL
03I failed when I went
03my friend and I were in line, right
03I go to get in line to get popcorn
03and they start letting people in
11I HEARD THE INCEPTION SOUND!!!
03I was like CRAP, get out of line, and miss my friend
11Linkara is in a dream within a dream!
Lol fail
03so I just politely cut in front of someone and went in anyway
XD
03and luckily he saved me a seat
Who is Linkara?
03an
03and then when I went back to get popcorn I just cut in line again LOL
11The geek in the fedora and glasses.
I have no idea. A guy who reviews bad comics I suppose.
03I swear, I look so not suspiciou\s noboedy cares
/me is choosing Inception as the A movie if he ever wins the A-movie lottery.
/me 11brohoofs Nittany again.
You look weak/innocent enough anyway xD
/me is choosing The Incrdible Hulk if he ever wins the A-Movie lottery
03yeah
/me brohoofs Silverscreen again.
03o.o
I've never seen Inception.
03Wtf
It might be as cool as The Matrix was around it's time.
11BONER!
11You have to pay close attention in the first half.
Which is still my favorite movie.
The Matrix and its sequels were good
Lawl, this is a playlist?
11yeah, this is on a playlist.
03It's weird when an MSN file transfer continues after they went offline
perhaps they set themselves to Appear offline
/me 11is gonna go get a shower then catch up on Nostalgia Critic videos. Might even watch some LInkara as well.
11G'NIGHT!
I was big on The Matrix when it was popular. I need to open up and watch my copy of The Animatrix, though.
Anyone watch AVGN here?
Since you talk about his friends.
11I watched a few AVGN vids.
Win
I've seen them all pretty much.
03well if they did no messages can get through
03someone name themselves Neville and do some shipping
I don't know what AVGN is
/me runs
11He's good, though, in my opinion, he's slightly less funny than NC. >.>
11Angry Video Game Nerd.
ah
I should see more NC.
Let's not
03LO
I know :p
03L
03anyway brb
Lul
11NC's best work is a couple of months after the first vid.
AVGN relies of massive use of explicitives and toilet humor (a little more than I care for), but he's still funny.
ohh
11It's then that he gets into the groove.
11agreed, Nittany. Too much on cursing and shitting, not enough focus on the humor itself.
!shipping
:)
I'll be missing that for work :<
/me bans cocks
11I'll be missing about 3 hours for school.
Unless my co-workers are bronies.
Which none of will admit to if we are.
o.o
such a shame
I'll be on and off
sharing with my brother

Trolols
Moar disconnect
Meanie connection
I need to watch the series through again to get a better feel for the characters in the fanfic I may write (Everfree Wind).
Though it's more of a disaster fanfic.
I just may need help with character personality.
He loves you
But I finally have a nice story for it.
What if it's a she?
Same different :p
*difference
12Wb
My connection is female and very much finds offense in you calling it male
Sorry then :<
She is happy now that you apologized :)
I bet she is happy with you...offline
:<
12lol Luna
I'm sure she can't help it! Just a little turbluence
Glacyyyyy

Don't you know why?
I'm sure she knows how you're distracting
I'm not the one using all the bandwidth

Gordon Freeman?
Oh
12o.o
lol
I'd have to question that individual's particular tastes, or to even test the susceptibility of his affinity for retro video gaming as reviewed by a person who doesn't seem to know the first thing of an NES cartridge, but why not.
or relatively content
?
12i'm sure sore
Well it was a 'Linkara' video at first.
The rest was just what was in the playlist.
12*just sore

Linux is only good for servers. :P
(Which I use my computer for, but meh)
03I shared that a while ago
It works pretty good on my craptop
Ah
I don't have to worry about viruses, etc...
I missed it then
I have suse 11.4 I think.
...
Stupid windows.
I need to run sfc /scannow some time.
I dumped windows gladly.
And I'm not a mac fan :/
Viruses probably messed with my windows files at some point.
I have an old lenovo laptop with 2.5 gigs of ram and a dual core processor, and it runs like new with linux.
lol
Its such a lightweight operating system compared to windows.
cats!
and I have a desktop cube :P
Yeah, I tend to screw up the user accounts on windows every few years.
So I have to switch around.
I've used all of the accounts that were made to start with on my computer.
This was my sister's old account. XD
lol.
I've broken mine, my mum's, and my dad's.
yeah windows is touchy.
So, I'm on this one now.
hard to maintain, very sensitive to viruses and crap.
Have you considered partitioning your drive?
Not really.
might work good for stuff like web browsing.
you don't pick up all the crap you get with windows.
So you use your computer as a server?
Yeah.
Web server, IRC, etc.
what all do you host?
and its an irc serve too?
cool :D
I wish I knew more about computers than I do. They are one thing I want to know more about.
Oh yeah, DNS server too.
I don't know anything about servers. or coding.
It's fairly easy to pick up.
I know people who di.
Also what dari said.
:O
ohai nittany :)
Hi.
The internet is the greatest resource of EVERYTHING. You can learn anything from the internet. XD
Yep.
I don't learn well from articles.
I learn a lot better hands on or with someone there to explain stuff too me.
It helped with my thesis when I needed to learn how to do certain things in Perl and C.
You don't really need to read articles.
You just have a look at some really well commented code.
See how it works.
Disect it.
mfw I don't have to read articles
*facehoof*
You can also learn a lot just be experimenting.
Yeah.
by*
I'm hoping setting up my own server will help alot.
Also, people will sometimes help others by giving them example code.
It's how I learned how to do variable file names in C.
I'm going to start searching for a donor desktop soon.
I'm shooting for a DC CPU and atleast 2 gigs of ram...
I think this will help a lot with speed, etc
Do you host any websites dari?
Well if I hosted sites myself they wouldn't be very fast (and my not be set up such that it's well protected).
03gg
I tend to host websites on my computer only as tests.
:<
To show people how a website I've made looks.
Then I'd set it up on free web hosting (which is actually pretty damn good).
03o.o
/me isn't leaving
12oh o.o
For example I just finished setting everything up with the bronystate website.
/me randomly typed stuff because he is bored
03xD
Free domain, and free web hosting.
12oh oxo
wow
/me cuddlez :3
it looks good!
/me 12cuddles back :3
...
Net split.
Lawl.
?
what the heck
why am I still here?
Because two servers on the network just disconnected from each other.
Well, two or more I suppose.
So the people on one server got separated from us on another server.
Because there was a net split.
Ah, there we go.
Servers reconnected.
glad I picked charizard.
Why?
XD
They were all on the same server, they didn't DC. :P
We were separate from them because we were on charazard.
We seem to be some of the only people on it. XD
oh I think I got it
MFW everyone is pinging.
and what's with the pinging? :P
Every so often the server sends you a ping (like a short message).
To make sure you are still connected.
If you don't respond to a ping for the set time (usually 120 seconds), the server disconnects you.
ah.
Netsplit again.
I see.
hmm
servers are being silly huh
Eeyup.
IRC servers usually have net splits every so often.
well anyway
since me and are you are close in age
what are you going to go to college for?
I've not decided what exactly (since there's a massive range of choice with computers), but some sort of computing/computer engineering
I might do pharmacy.
Its a very stable profitable field over here
and easy compared to being a doc.
Hm, sounds good.
I can't imagine myself working in any job for a long period of time that's not computing.
I would want to be a doctor but med school is 12 years long :P
It's only 7 years over here.
:P
pharmacy is 6
over here
the US is pretty tough on doctors... There's a lot of foreign ones now.
Well, 7 years in university (your college over there I think), then you have a number of years sort of more practical stuff.
I'd assuming shadowing other doctors, etc.
because they train in another country for 2, then transfer their license from whatever counrty and start making a ton of money.
hi Kosovoeon
-o
03E:3
well... just me you and the bots now :P
Eeyup. XD
;o
Are you the youngest one on the bronystate staff?
Yeah.
its cool that you know wo much about computers at such a young age.
*so
especially software and coding.
It really opens up your future, because computers really are the future and all that stuff.
It's nice that I'm sure that what I do in the future will be something that I enjoy.
I have one friend who knows a little about hardware, but nothing about coding.
03nini
he's a jerk but the only other person around here that is willing to talk about somputers.
*computers
and that too.
>friend
>jerk
Wut?
Its a love-hate thing.
12nini
I love him but he has an obnoxious personality.
Ahh.
You can only take so much being around him.
and like I said he's the only other person who knows computers.
well there's one other guy but he's too wrapped up in gaming to learn anything useful.
dat flash plugin
XD
Yeah, flash going really slowly for some reason, so I ended its process.
http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/koma-comic-strip-its-only-fair.jpg < Yawn
/me sleeps
I need really need to run SFC /scannow. XD
that'll teach it.
nini
what's that?
Compares all your windows files with the CD to see if any have been modified/removed.
ahh.
Not sure if I know where my windows CD is though.
aww...
you have windows 7?
XP
ah.
I liked XP best.
I love XP.
Its what was on this computer before I switched to linux.
Vista is just horrible.
Vista is horrible.
I hate it.
Vista was a mistake XD
And windows 7 is alright, but I think they're trying too hard to make it just look pretty, so people go "Durrr, IT LOOKS SO NIIIIIIIIIIICE".
and I don't care much for 7 because its not as modifiable as XP.
So it has all this unecessary stuff.
It's like a mac or something.
You can't even uninstall IE on windows 7, its integrated into the systen.
"LOOKS PRETTY, MUST BE GOOD"
Wut.
yup.
*system
You can't...?
God damn.
I didn't even know that. >_>
oh. yeah. You can't uninstall it like any other program.
its stuck in there with system files or something :P
>_______________________________________>
Just finding some registry entry I need to chaange.

good thing I'm on the same one as you.
Need to restart for the registry change to take effect.

What?
I get OP when its just me and the servers split
I kicked myself!
yeah...
XD
are all episodes on tonight or tomorrow night?
tomorrow
mmkay
at 12 est
I think
Check the home page to be sure.
For me it's today already.
Plus the person's already left Polar. :P
needsmorepony just now left.
aurelelia left before
but anyway.
Damn.
:P
what?
I got them the wrong way round then.
oh XD
yeah I get a message anytime someone leaves or joins on my new client.
Haha.
who is GGgala?
Dunno.
yeah its kinda annoying during the stream, but its ok at times like this.
What kind of music do you listen to?
I like most music, but mainly what I listen to is metal.
I listen to some metal... not much. My main stuff is 60's to 90's rock
Cool.
:3
Went to see my friend's band play the other day.
well that's good you are going out for something you like as a career
oh that's cool
They're really good.
I want to join a band when I go to college/university
Got any videos of them?
My friend's even played in front of 1000 plus people before.
:O
Nah, but their EP is going to be finished soon.
wow
They're getting it recorded at the moment.
That's awesome.
I don't know if I like pharmacy that much... its just a job I guess
but they say if they pick something you love you will never work a day in your life.
Well, I wouldn't call a computing job work anyway.
I'd probably do half my job in my free time. :P
lol.
Just because I love doing it.
yeah.
What kinds of grades do you get?
Then you have to retake them if your grades aren't high enough?
yeap. you get marks at the end of each marking period for what all classes you are in.
And you would have to retake a class if you fail it, yes.
Oh.
Every so often we would get something similar at our school.
they are usually a percentage, with anything above 70 considered passing.
Except they aren't really at all important.
You never have to retake stuff like that.
Ours are pretty important in the long term, but only in short term if you fail.
Colleges/universities look at how you did in high school.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_gt6OJc6Ec&feature=related
In terms of that, you'd get a 1-5 for achievement (1 being highest), and A-E for effort.
Achievement, I'd get fairly average, because most people at our school don't during the majority of school.
Without hopefully sounding too conceited, we don't have to.
We can just put in work for the last month of school and get better results than most of the rest of the country.
hmm
very different from what I'm used to XD
yeah.
liike final exams?
you do*
Though there isn't that much of it.
there's a lot of it for us.
but I usually only do enough to get by.
The education system here is designed for the average person
I'm not really sure about ours.
and I find it extremely easy.
Almost all of the people I speak to who don't go to my school but live in my area are expecting marks much lower than just about everyone in our school.
I'm ranked 5th out of a class of 105 and I spend literally 0 time studying/doing homework outside of school.
That's really good.
Sounds pretty similar to our school compared to the population actually.
If I tried/cared I could probably do better.
But as long as I stay in about the 7th percent I don't care much.
And people are our school are supposed to be in the top 5% for intelligence in the UK.
at*
Do you go to a private school?
No, it's a grammar school, I don't think they exist in the US.
It's government funded, but you can only enter if if you pass an entrance exam.
Drf
I got it lol
nope. We have public and private schools. Similar to what you describe
03Nice
except private aren't gov't funded.
hence "private"
No video, my camera couldn't pick it up
We have private schools too.
ah.
Audio though, that's what I wanted, I got it
Some have entrance exams, some don't, it just means they're fee paying for us.
Then yeah, public schools are government funded, no entrance exam.
03yeah
03same with the IMAX here
I wish the US did something like grammar school.
Grammar schools tend to have a more 'classical' education.
They are too "every child deserves the same education"
You are required to take all the sciences and maths, and either French or German at our school.
And English of course.
Dome screens and phones, nope
03Fail
03it was a dome screen?
03I HATE those
but the only way they can do that is if they make the materials very simple and easy to understand.
Like Latin and Ancient Greek.
wow.
That's pretty cool.
It actually isn't too bad
Normally they are
This time was decent
The people who did Latin AND Ancient Greek regretted it I think. XD
The material here is made for, like I said, the average intelligence and its honestly boring
03well
03Harry Potter was clearly not intended for a dome screen LOL
almost depressing, to see what the standard of education is.
This is try
True
Ki yu xd vb ooo
I can see why japan is kicking our asses with education and stuff.
But I got the song woot
Like I said, school is too easy for me. I'm honestly bored with it.
I would have thought it would achieve better results than the UK system, because you are required to work throughout your time at school, unless you want to retake stuff (but not if you're clever enough I suppose).
Like yourself.
I think most bronys are smart.
Do you have anything between highschool and college?
I haven't met a stupid one XD
no after high school you either join the workforce of continue your education at a university.
Hmm.
Or if you are an idiot you drop out of high school all together.
After the age of 16 education becomes optional in the UK.
You usually finish your GCSEs at 16, then all education after that is optional.
wow. Its "mandatory" until you are 17/18 here.
GCSEs being the qualifications your work for at secondary school (highschool).
you*
hmm
Then after that at 16+ you are working for A levels.
Interesting.
Either your secondary school can have a sixth form.
03uh
So you can stay and do A levels there.
03she already left
Or you could leave to go to another secondary school, which has a sixth form.
14LOL
That makes sense.
Or college, which over here is a school that exclusively deals with education from 17-18, A level time.
The system here, you go through grades 1-18, then you graduate, and move on to college if you want.
Hmm.
I mean 1-12.
Sorry.
You go to school until you are 17/18.
High school is considered grades 9-12.
Oh.
College.
You can actually drop out at 16 in the us.
it's just.. highly unrecommended.
it is discouraged though.
yeah.
School after grade 12 is called college, and the schools are called universities.
O_o
It costs a lot.
Ok.
or you can go to a technical school and it costs less.
:3
Yeah, university is expensive here to.
We used to have polytechnics over here in the UK.
grade school, (1-12) is gov't funded(free). After that you are on your own.
But they got phased out and either become universities or shut down.
too*
yeah technical school also.
but I don't think they are as good as college.
Student fees are something like tripling over here for university the year I'm going. >_>
Mainly for technical degrees.
like you could be a licensed mechanic or technician.
that sucks dari...
Oh God.
god yes.
This video.
It is all I wanted.
Non-G4 ponies.
Wut.
wtf
Oh yeah, I am upset about that though.
Creepy.
XD
its cherilee!
XD
I'm beginning to feel the fear.
annual tuition fees - which were a flat rate of £1,175 - have, since September 2006, been varied from nothing up to a maximum of £3,000 (index linked)
okok
I've had enough >_>
music?
or can you read us something :3
now
play the rarity version
noooooo
riddled with plot
Just let me check how much debt I could be in after university.
Ok, if I did a 3 year course.
And was living somewhere expensive, for example London.
12guess she didn't want to talk to you drf
03:(
03Not in the mood for jokes x.x
I could be about £71,000 in debt, which is $115,648.
Enjoy elephants again.
T_T
12ok
holy crap.
I'm sorry
I can't hear you very well

12It really depends on the university however
dumb fabric
wwwhoa?
oh?
03yeah but I've never heard of a university with a 3 year program
03usually it's 2 or 4, or even more if you want a master's degree etc
12Because some university’s in the US would have you in even more debt
Yeah, we have 3 year courses in the UK.
Back on stage girls.

03you can copy PS2 games, but in order to play them you'll either need a modded PS2 or a hacked memory card which I have
pinky ozzbourne.
02Not PS2
03PS1, I've heard rumors that you can just copy and play them, never beena ble to test it
02Just PS1
03some people have said you can play them
03others said it doesn't work
02They work :P
duck shooter of whatever the fuck this was called XD
03I think it depends what model of PS1 you have
03apparently there's a model that doesn't care about copies
03LOL, lucky you then
03I only have a PS2 and (EW) PS3

0oh yeah do different voices.
Do the voices!
Yes
0no, just do the voices.

I'm playing tomorrow during the stream
Because it's not during a scheduled stream time it was only 10 people instead of 250+ though.
YES
that's brilliant
Which is some consolation.
million bronies died today due to alcohol poisoning
Why?! Why must I have a presentation today?!
XD
what presentation?
12<3 Liiiiiiiiiiiiink
Hey dari why are there so many mods?
school project most likely
It seems like they have a lot of time on their hands.
No one pony should have all that friendship
to kick me.
because they all work on the site x3 making it better
Because we are anticipating when we stream S2 episodes live we'll have even more people.
and to kick polar
So we'll need a lot of mods.
We have to present our recommendations around the strategic plan for a local summer camp.
You managed to find all the Equestria Daily banners?
Mainly to kick polar
What are you talking about? O_o
ah.
that seems easy dashite
and yeah I recognized that.
why aren't you talking to us anymore dari :(
Yeah, didn't way it was going to be hard. Just that I have to be there for it.
I dunno, I suppose I'm out of things to say. :P

But it sadly does not make you any money. :/

Maybe.

Once the operation that fuses Luna and Celestia's body together is complete
Celunia will finally get into the cookie jar.
And we will all revel in the chocolately goodness
Maybe i need to see if Polarfire is really dead.
12:3
12o.o

Gummy: My manifestation into an invincible physical form will be complete.

Gummy: Then nothing will be able to stop my complete takeover of equestria.
I Like freezing
Gummy: even celunia's combined powers will be no match.
Beats sweating

Celunia: NO! NOT THE BEES! NOT THE BEES NOT THE BEES!
12don't you ever shovel snow?
OUR INVASION WILL BEGIN
OMg yes
Celunia: Wait... I think I recognize that place...
HAHAHA
But we bought a snow blower this year
:D
AND THE BEST PART
/me takes it away
NOPONY WILL HAVE AND IDEA WE ARE COMING
THEY WILL BE DEFENSLESS AGAINST THE ONSLAUGHT
Celunia: Dragonass point! On the other side of the Everfree forest!
NOW
WE MARCH
:(
CHAAAAAARGEEE!!!!!
12^^
THE TIME IS NOW
*end of scry
In 2010 I had to shovel 33 inches of snow
I'm a veteran
;p
Celunia: The only way we can stop this is by using the elements of harmony.
12o-o
Celunia: But the elements can only turn into their true form if they are combined
Celunia: but since Twilight and co. ARE the elements...
12!weather 88001
Celunia: We will need to combine them.

Celunia: The surgery starts tomorrow.
12Yay, it cooled down XD
Celunia: Only then can they turn into...
*parasprites buzz in the distance*
Flutterlightappleraredashpie
But we have no time! The parasprites will be here in hours!
Don't u like snow Umbreon
12no
Celunia: Then we will have to fight. Fight until it is finished. Change of plans: The surgery starts now.
12i hate it
Gtfo
Its awesome
All fluffy and white and cold
Celunia: Send all the troops we have into battle. Gummy must stop.
It purifies the landscape ;o
Celunia: Unlike them, we have the element... of suprise.
*Scene change to PolarFire*
HEHEHEHEHE
12not when you have to shovel it
/me is flying a balloon above the parasprite horde
RUN MY ARMY RUNNN
SOON WE WILL CONTROL EQUESTRIA
Trixie: But I thought parapsprites fly?
Oh trixie haven't you learned anything?
There!
12Well, I better be going right about now
Trixie: What?
The lights of canterlot in the distance!
12Good night everyone?
THOSE FOOLS
12!*
They have no idea!
We will destroy them!
Trixie: Haha! They actually think they can WIN! How quaint!
Come Trixie! ONWARD TO BATTLE!!
*scene change to MidnightStar*
Trixie: We can't really go faster in this balloon.
I have an idea that just might work...
I shovel it
I enjoy it
How about instead of the paras eating us...
We eat THEM!
Especially when it snows so hard you clean the driveway and turn around and see it's covered again
12heh
Lol
Celunia: Genius! That also eliminates the cost of rations!
Celunia: How is the surgery coming along, doctor?
*nudge nudge*
Doctor: Its going marvelously.
They.... them.... IT will be ready in less than an hour.
It is VERY IMPORTANT
12not to mention driving gets more dangerous in the snow
Celunia: What ponies have you combined so far?
All of them.
I just need to finish the skin overlap.
I do donuts in the snow
They MUST be kept away from the parasprites.
With my car
Celunia: The troops... They
Lol
They're being devoured...
12crazy
Any exposure to the sprites will disrupt the elements...
and then all is lost.
I'm afraid the parasprites will reach here before we finish
Unless...
You just gotta have fun
Unless we go.
Forget the annoying parts :p
We must retreat.
The parasprites are devouring the troops...
Our only hope now is the elements.
the troops do not have our level of magic.
But they are being eaten so ravenously...
We, celestia and luna might be able to hold them off just enough to finish.
Very well.
We have shielding powers...
We can create a barrier.
I'll continue the surgery.
You work on the shield.
It's our only hope now...
*starts channeling magic*
*parasprite scouts begin to fly through the wondows of the castle*
Derpy: What was that buzzzing noise?
Derp it must just be me
Herp Derp
*Parasprites engulf derpy*
HEEERRRRPPPPPPPP
Celunia: The barrier is finished. As long as we stay alive we can keep it up.
They are all stable...
It will only be minutes now.
abomination: FRRRIIIIEEEENNNDDDSSSSSSS
It is ready!!!
GOGOGO
*elements activate*
Abomination: *rolls towards parasprites*
*the room is filled with a blinding light*
NANANANANANANA KATAMARI DAMACYYYYYY
*parasprites begin to burn in the radiation*
Zombie Polarfire: What??
What is happening?
Celunia: I am afraid my magic is sapped.
What is this???
My troops are dying!
What is that light in the castle towe?
*tower?
Abomination: MY LITTLE PONYYY MY LITTLE PONYY
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Trixie: Whay is happening?
Trixie: THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU PROMISED
Gilda: Did it just get hotter all of a sudden?
*blinding light engulfs the area around canterlot*
Reverberations eminate from the sbomination, wiping parasprites away like dust*
Zombie Polarfire: NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
Doctor: The only creatures that are immune to the effects of SUPER CANCER are zombies! We should have gotten them all!
*balloon containing Zombie polarfire and Trixie bursts into flames and plummets towards the ground*
Celunia: *cough* take... it to Dragonass point... Gummy must be almost done now... *cough*
Yes, I will continue your wish Celunia.
*scene change to dragonass point*
Abomination: AUDHAWUFHAWFHIUAFHA Translation:We can handle it from here.
*it rolls into the secret base*
*scene change to throne room*
Very well. I will see what I can do for celunia and what is left of the ponies of canterlot. I might be able to heal them....
Abomiation: He seems to be deeper into the base.
*scene change to crashed balloon*
COUGH COUGH
Zombie Polarfire: fuck this shit I'm moving away....
I'm sorry master gummy....
Trixie: Wait!
Trixie!
Ghoul Trixie: Don't leave me here!
You are alive!
well sorta...
Ghoul Trixie: My skin! My skin is ruined!
My perfect skin!
This is all your fault!
Away with us! We shall not deal with it any longer...
And don't worry....
we'll find a nice body for you to posess later.
I hate you. *turns around*
ugh.
You said we would win. You lied.
*scene changes to dragonass point, gummy*
Abomination: Hello? Is anyone here?
Gummy: So...
This is what greets me...
this is what destroyed my army...
well.
No matter.
I am invincible.
Pinkie pie head: Gummy, don't you remember me?
They were merely slaves designed to do my job for me.
Now you will see the power of my TRNE FORM
Pinkie pie head: DO YOU WANT TO THROW AN "ALL YOUR ARMY DIED" PARTY?
*grabs pinkie head*
Gummy?
What are you doing?
*head manifests into a half-alligator half-pinkie monstrosity*
GNOTNED IUO FELX (NOW FOOLS)
GNYIUT WTYU (FACE MY WRATH)
*charges abomination*
rarity: WHY ARE YOU BEING SO MEEEAN TO USSSS
STOPPP ITTT! ITT HURRTSSS!
*rolls out of way
unleash the elements *hint hint*
Twilight: I get the feeling we should release the elements
NWARTIG LINGRET (Nothing can stop me!)
Ready?
They have an army of guards and they send me... this? What is this?
Surely celunia jests!
All: Ready!
What??
EEXXXPLOOOODDDDEEEEEEE!
Hey what are you doing?
NNNRAAAAWRRR WHAT IT THISSS
NOOOO
I
AM
INVINCIBLE
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO MEEEEEEE!!!!!
Twilight: Invincible means you cannot be harmed
NNRWAAAA
Applejack: We just harmed you, sugarcube.
*pinkie's head separates from the mutation*
Pinkie: OH BOY! LET'S THROW A PARTY!
*Gummy is left in the ray of light the elements give off*
NOO
MY BODYYYYY
*Gummy vaporizes*
Aww. We were having so much fun.
*scene changes to canterlot*
The doctor was able to save celunia,
and they... it lived on.
But what about the cookie jar?
The abomination was able to be separated, but some body parts got switched.
Fluttershy now has 3 ears,
and rarity is missing a tail...
ZombiePolarfire lived on to put up with ghoulTrixie's nagging
And gummy is no more.
Blah.
I'm tired now.
Peace reigns over equestria again.
What've you guys been doing?
The end :3
ohhh dari you missed out big time bro
:2,15'(
Me and midnight just made the most epic clashchat ever
and I saved every bit of it.

On the stream.
Yeah its better
Woo, also video finished.

Youtube are pretty clever.
They just remove the first part.
So you can't watch it anyway.
Clever company
Hmmm
Don't trust the japanese people
YFW it actually works.

BAD WOLF
Those robots.
They're robot versions of Trinny and Suzana, they're two women on some sort of 'makeover' show.
Like Anne Robinson in the Weakest Link is the Annedroid in this.
I don't watch those shows
04hey Xeli
Basically all the shows in this episode are spoofs of current shows.
I probably don't know about them cause they're regional
I suppose.

nuuuuuuuuuu
I want that Twilight Sparkle
Unfortunately
Got it off eBay.
I only have the McDonald's toys at the moment
Nice
They're only sold in Germany at the moment, blind bag ponies.
Though they're coming to the US.
Nothing for the UK. T_T
I see only G3 pony toys here
The McDonald's ones are the only G4 ones
McDonald's ones haven't come here yet.
/me randomly casts a magic spell that makes everything try to kill you
Not sure if they ever will.
>_>
Where do you live?
U.K.?
England.
Huh
We get McDonald's ponies before you guys
Funny
The show only came over here on July 4th.
So there's not been much time for any merchandise to come along.
/me sits back as the curtain, keyboard, speakers, monitor, desk lamp, table, chair, bed, wardrobe, floor, ceiling, walls, windows, iPhone, and everything else in his room starts trying to kill him
Oh noes! My bed is trying to murder me!
Argh! My keyboard is trying to eat me!
I got the Twilight Sparkle for £4 including P+P.
Nice.
o
heya Skylands
10hiya
so dead from profile editing x.x
10lul
I hate CSS ):
10Same, as I hardly know how to edit it
I do but doing the profile thing like on TST is annoying
takes too much time
10Your work will pay off regardless
lol what work?
10Fixing up the code for profiles?
oh lol
I'm lazy :p
it has about 1000 bugs
and the links don't colour properly and so on
and I'm sure I've left things out because I'm lazy and couldn't be bothered to be thorough
10Heh
and the dropdown menus weren't colour because I didn't try, and some of the stuff I couldn't figure out
/me fools around with the new code now
good luck
it's messy as crap
10I don't care, since my current old profile code is screwed up too
10:P
10!espeon !umbreon
/me now belongs to Skylands for 7 minutes
/me now belongs to Skylands for 20 minutes
true
10Hm
10Unclicked hyperlinks are red and change to white once you've clicked them?
uh
You can change it.
a:hover is when you mouseover them
and yes, unclicked hyperlinks are red
10k
and clicked ones are some random shade of white
a:visited controls that
if you read my post, a:link which is the unclicked hyperlinks
is broken atm probably due to some other part of the code
I'll fix it tomorrow
Ohai NewDCD.
ohai dari
You gunna start streaming now?
everything's ready on my end
Ok.
7and here I thought you went resting :o
I've only slept four hours getting all the episodes, but no matter
I've tested the playlist, everything's in order
should anything happen to me, the show will go on
So my stream was...37 hours long.
Wow.
Dari
you
I just stopped streaming now.
were awake THAT long?
So my stream was 37 hours long.
And now we're having a 10 hour pony stream.
God damn.
I slept during one of the videos, it was 13 hours long.
XD
...what were you guys watching
Lots of Torchwood, Doctor Who.
We watched some Adventure Time (which I thought was pretty creepy O_o).
PMVs
An hour of someone counting.
An hour of myomyomymom.
Something called linkara.
And a lot of videos in some plalist.
playlist*
Oh and I was on mic for more than an hour I think.
Got blackmailed into singing Winter Wrap Up. XD

Already am. :P
11Just sent the Monday Email.
11DCD: Here's the Discussion thread if that's what you wanted: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/36293225.html
7lots of background noise I hear
11I hear it too.
disconnected a cable
how about now?
BTW what FPS, and kbps do you use for FME DCD?
30 FPS, going to use 350 kbps because people were complaining it lagged
some people just didn't have a good enough connection, but yeah
7still hear the background noise
7pony image looking great
7gone now
how about...kay
11It was lagging for me last night.
Gone.
now tell me about the stream's volume
11Who was streaming then?
No more background noise.
7great
11BG STatic noise is gone.
11Napping.
I can turn up the volume a bit more up if you want
Looks good from my end.
Volume good on my end too.
7looks excellent
11Volume's great.
7and sounds excellent too
Sudden quality drop?
7yep
that's due to the action scene
Ah.
11Quality is a bit fuzzy now and then, but that's expected in stream.
that's why I hate streaming at lower-than-possible quality
http://www.nhne.org/news/NewsArticlesArchive/tabid/400/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/4220/language/en-US/Lightning-Strike-Turns-Surgeon-Into-ComposerConcert-Pianist.aspx <- oo
11Unfortunatly, higher quality means more lag.
10Silverscreen!
10sup :3
11I prefer no lag and lower quality.
restarting
11ohai RainBroDash.
500 kbps testing
The part where Simone and Lina turn into tiger women is so sexy ;~; [Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]

XD
not sure if should stream in 500
a few people complain to lag
not MANY but still
11Much good, yes.
im getting a bit of lag but mostly down to the really rubbish connection where i am
11That's likely because of connection.
when the stream starts ill be in a better location
/me 11gives a cupcake to Insert Cupcake.

*Yeah
I've been streaming different things from the end of the Saturday stream till now.
Oh well, In that case I'll have to stick around longer after the movies end this week.
I made last night's line-up happen.
To be honest what you posted was a small portion of the stream. :P
/me 11goes to watch some AT4W until the event starts. :D
It was pretty long, people seemed to like what you posted though.
YAY!
OMG!FreddieW posted a new vid on his channel!

Sorry.

I don't remember hearing this song before
9Investigations 2
so that's why
9Objection! 2011 - Miles Edgeworth
Investigations 2 will never come out here.
/me 11has only played the first Phoenix Wright. Should download the roms for the others.
I guess I should look for an illegal version then
OBJECTION!
nyan cat?
9Investigations 2 has no plans by Crapcom to come stateside
11NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN
9luckily it's being fan translated
NYAN CANNON ACTIVATE!
11Did you hear that Crapcom blamed the fanbase for that Megaman game being cancelled?
9dude
9what HASN'T Capcom done?
They are just trolls now
9puh-lease
9Trolls have more decency
9I'm still in awe as to how a single game company can FUCK UP so royally in the span of a week
11It's a good thing I bought Street Fighter IV before all this shit happened, because I sure as hell wouldn't be getting it now.
/me 11headbobs.
Can't remember if it was someone here that showed me this, but oh well.
I'll post it anyway.
11HEY!
11DCD!
11I WAS HEADBOBBING!
11WHAT THE HELL?!
9KEIKAKU DOORI
Capcom can't make new games.Proof:Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3,Super Street Fighter 4,Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition,etc.
Someone told me capcom was just phasing out megaman because the creator when he retired was saying bad things about them.
11Destructor236: It's a selling ploy that they've always used. They made, like, fifteen different versions of Street Fighter 2 before moving on to Street Fighter III
True dat y'all.
11The problem is that....IT FUCKING WORKED!
11Not once, but TWICE!
They only made 3 SF3's as far as I know
9yeah and the SF3's were a bit different in that regard
9they were actually sequels of one another
true
9that said
9I don't know
They were broken as all hell though.
9perhaps the only way I'd forgive Capcom is if they undo everything they've done this past week
9localize Investigations 2
9....and include Elena in SOME game
11Release Investigations 2
11Get that Megaman game uncanceled and given a release date.
9because seriously Elena deserves to be in a new game.
11Get working on Capcom vs. Mortal Kombat.
11Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat*
Elena is wierd.
9she was also fun to play
I trust you.
9the healing Special Art was a pretty cool addition for a fighting game
9and she's hot as hell /thread
HEALING?WTF?
That's worst then Gill's Resurection bullshit.
9the healing is pretty balanced though
9I'm surprised you played the game and didn't come across that
9also, music related
I didn't play the game.
I played MUGEN against a perfect conversion of Gill.
And since i got like 100+ characters in my MUGEN,it's random who i'm gonna fight.

9A Pyramid must be tri-dimensional!
@InsertCupcake What are you made of?
best day EVER
awhu?
IT'S A 2D PYRAMID DEAL WITH IT
11Destructor236: InsertCupcake is made of Pinkie Pie. :P
Are you a cupcake InsertCupcake?
9this is
<.< >.> yes...
9my final piece of evidence!
im a peanut butter cupcake
This is my favorite song in the series
9The dictionary definition of PYRAMID!
9a. A solid figure with a polygonal base and triangular faces that meet at a common point. b. Something shaped like this polyhedron.
9This...
InsertCupcake: I wouldn't mind inserting my cupcake into you if you know what i mean ;)
9*FINGER POINT*

I think I know what you mean
@Silverscreen But how CAN it be made of Pinkie?

11Destructor236: Do not question the ways of the pink one.
@Silverscreen I am questionning the ways of the Cupcake.

Japan.... >:[
ANIME...
9>hating Japan just for hating Japan
How do I change name
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
Black RX was best Kamen Rider, NewDCD.
Thank you.
9also this is a live action series
Holo's Wolf Whistling song!
Something happened with Kamen Rider Amazon though. That was terrible.
9also
I really liked the line about going beyond infinity
Eddie_the_Curious_Pony: OOOs is awesome. :P
9>hating animu irrationally
Irrationally?
I request "AT4W Full Theme".
9>loving FiM, which obviously has some animu inspiration
I'm still not sure where this counter is. . .
Yoiu wanna start this?
9hey, lately, anime has been shit, yes
YOU WANNA INCUR THE RAGE?
9but there are actually good old ones, ja?
NewDCD: By the same token, anime (old anime) was inspired by the crazy adventures of Scrooge McDuck.
9pretty much
^
9yeah
9I consider both animation
9can't love one and hate the other
9because they are the same medium
And Betty Boop.
And Tijuana Bibl- Oh.
Oh, did it work then Silver?
11AH HAVE THE POWAH!
11yes, Dari, It worked.
Meh, I just call them cartoons.
Hey Doc.
9*shrug* pretty much
Dari,can you play my request?
11How is it hypocritical?
I'm not streaming. :P
11They're two entirely different styles of animation.
It's a song.
9because they're both animation/cartoons, and ergo the same medium
11It's different styles though.
9yeah
NewDCD: uwu
ARGH
Third video, NewDCD.
Kinda like hating on oil paintings :P
9the key word is
9"Hate"
9you can say "I dislike anime's tropes" or something
>translation
>what
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wavpWRK6IX8
This is hilarious.
9but when you go around hating on anime like that, yeah...
9I mean
9it's like
Reminds me of the silly translation of that Green Leaves song. . .can't remember the name. The performers were five japanese guys wearing fig leaves.
9hating on people because they like cartoons
9and yet, YOU like Cartoons
06girl = negative
06boy = positive?
9in that sense, there should be no distinction
06?
/me runs
;P
9you can say "it's not my taste" but not openly antagonize people for their likes
You could still argue conceptual and stylistic differences and still get away with it.
9yeah, but he wasn't doing that
9he was just being...well, you get me
Thanks for playing the request by the way.
Yay!
9after this, back to poni
What is this i don't even.
The only Kamen Rider to have a tofu cook off... to my knowledge.
10Girl should be positive

/me hides
I BE TRIPPIN.
9well in Agito there was a tofu HANDLING-off
this guy just asked
to be an admin on my BNC service
COMPOUND THOSE PIRATES
THEY DRIVE ME TO FIGHT
Well maybe, but that's not quite as bad ass
Getting tofu to not taste like crap? That's hard.
Don't forget the rum.
http://pastebin.com/Yt94ranJ
9Tofu tastes like egg to me
Q'APLAH
9at least the one I've eaten

I misread ranJ as rant
Probably the only song I legitimately love outside of being a Tokusatsu show opening.

I thought I was watching Japan's take on Crysis for a moment.
9but yeah. He was coming across as intolerant of other people's likes as well as other cultures

Wear a pink t-shirt?
9SAME FOR THE WOMEN!
9NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN IF YOU JUST STAND IN THE SIDELINES AND WATCH!

Nope.

I wonder if there are any plans for a big budget MLP game.
9>licensed games
9>big budget
9sadly, the world doesn't work that way
It did.
At least, not for E.T.
I guess not. There are some pretty good licensed games, but they're not exactly in the majority.
9yeah
have you seen http://www.ponyspin.com ;:V

9I can only think of the Spiderman games
11OOOOOOOOOOLD!
9and Arkham Asylum
9but then again
9superhero games
I like the Lego games.
11Arkham City :D
Ponies can be superheros
I thought X-Men Origins Wolverine was a pretty good game.So was Spider-Man 2 and Arkham Asylum.
sup bronies
That Wolverine game was awesome for me up until the point where you lose all powers. It just seemed to be the opposite of what should happen.
That never happened to me.
If Wolvering lost all his powers. . .wouldn't he still have the adamantite skeleton?
GOOD DAY EVERYBRONY.
It's just temporary, after you get out of the tank. Still bugged me.
Hey Dermathil.

hey guys.

But while the flower is initially shown to have eight petals, it's depicted as being completely lacking any later. The rearrangement of the flowers in the vase is minor by comparison.

11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: The title of this episode references buck season, which is a time of year in which the hunting of deer and bucks is allowed in order to cull their numbers. This also references the time of year when their apples are being collected. The term 'applebuck' also plays on the word 'buck' which can both mean a deer, as well as 'a sharp, sudden,

11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: The muffins that Applejack made in this episode would not cause food poisoning in real-life, as the ingredients are used in a variety of other foods. The only way to suffer food poisoning from them, is to remove the muffins from the oven extremely early. Additionally, it is chemically impossible to bake muffins (by definition)
11without the core essentials being flour and baking soda (or alternatively baking powder). However, the stomach problems may have been caused by the muffins containing worms, since real ponies cannot eat meat

0WERE SENDING YOU TO REHAB
uh oh time for baked bads
anyone ever made these?
0Derpy Muffins time
11RANDOM PONY EPISODE: This episode, along with Fall Weather Friends and A Bird in the Hoof, had arguably hinted that Equestria's ponies may have omnivorous tendencies, making them more human-like than horse-like. In the case ofApplebuck Season, Applejack seems to regard earthworms as edible since she did not question Pinkie Pie's (misheard) baking instructions
They were all courageous, technically.
11Additionally, Spike kept pandering at his pony friends to try out the muffins, and he was assuringly aware of the earthworms inside the muffins. However, Applejack was not thinking straight while the muffins were being baked, so the contradiction may have simply slipped her mind, and Spike, being a baby, might not be fully aware of the pony diet.
9>suddenly Guy Shishiou comes in from a Portal
11In any case, Pinkie's song in Over a Barrel clearly states that ponies are "strictly vegetarian." AppleBloom wasn't asked to help because she hasn't made an offical opearence yet.
>Equestria need more horses, they are braveer.

0.9 repeating / 3 == 0.3 repeating. What's 1 / 3?
north = up
Oh no! A seapony! Kill it! Kill it!
oh no I missed so much
1/3 = 0.3 repeating
1/3 is 0.333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333
1/3=.33 repeating
11Move left, but stay right.
and more
I liked the explanation that .9 repeating is the same as 1 by using the explanation that two different numbers always have another number that is between them, and since .9 repeating has no number larger than it but smaller than 1, they must be the same.
sure is
PINKIE PIE
because .9 repeating = 1
^^
dsnesmith true true
0title theme
Smidgemeter is a standard unit of measurement
HES HUMING MLP THEME!!!
Robotpinkie: 0.9 repeating IS =1
So 0.9 repeating == 1, exactly
flawed maths at their best
Stop humming the intro
OMFG!!
spike was humming the theme song ^^
Spike breaking 4th wall
0heckup
Smidgeameter
Spike evolved into a Spaminator
lol that's what I said, there seemed to be some protest.
Course, then I remembered using integrals and such to show that converting .9 repeating into a fraction ends up creating 9/9, or 1.

Silvermane thinks that trixie talks about trixie far too much. Silvermane believes Silvermane to matter much more than Trixie.

With crap like that bear and the dragon in the Everfree forest, how does Ponyville not get constantly destroyed?
That.
MAJORLY
2nd major-joke
She already did when she defeated Nitemare Moon
/me RANDOM PONY TRIVIA IN HONOUR OF SILVERSCREEN:"The Great and Powerful Trixie" refers to herself as such or is called so by other characters a total of 20 times during the episode.
so many references to herself in the third person at this point i think trixie crossed over into the 4th and 5th person prespective
Minorly
Spike's voice actress rocks
Ponyville: the Tokyo of Equestria
volume up too loud, must turn down. (who invited skrillex to the party)
despite being tiny and rural
Trixie is credit to ponies. She actually tries to fight the Ursa Minor off.

It's okay, trixie. It happens to the best of us
Silvermane, we all new that already, you silly pony
/me RANDOM PONY TRIVIA IN HONOUR OF SILVERSCREEN:This episode shows Rainbow Dash ISN'T immune to motion-sickness, despite her acrobatic-routines, although her nausea could have come from Trixie catching her off-guard.
