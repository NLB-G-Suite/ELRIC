But the snake lols

It was in Eq.D.
Oh.Now i remember!
/me hasn't seen HP7 part 2 yet
Haters gonna hate, and then they get curious...
03I jut saw it in IMAX
03plus an hour of waiting in line
03etc
03I've been gone sincd 3
03(it's 9PM here)
03*since
03well, MP2 to be precise o.o
03Sakuya
03just saw HP7.2 in IMAX
I'm about to
I'm on my way now
03oh
03nice
03see if you can film the IMAX intro while you;'re at it :P
03I got the one from my theater but unfortunately you can't see anything, only hear it
03(which is fine, there's not much to see LOL)
that is about the best way to get you thrown out of a theater
and banned from it
I'm only filming the intro
its awesome hurr
03nickstr, I said INTRO
03Like, the thing that shows off the IMAX projection
Granted that's bad too, but not as much
03I got away with it
03since everybody texts at hte theater until like 2 seconds before the movie starts anyway
03it looks natural XD
On my way to the train
Wheee
03o.o
03WUT.
03train? o.o
03our IMAX put decorations up all over
03tgo make it look like Hogwarts
03I got pictures
03remind me later XD
Or neutrals.
But I lean towardy bronyism.
makes sense
And my side pain is going away.
03well
03they had the same decorations for 6 and 7.1 too
03they're basically little flags with the 4 houses that hang down from the light fixtures
Bronyism:Cures side pain.Take THAT Next Wave!
03and when you step into the theater they have a sign that says Platform 9 3/4
03they also have a banner with the crest(?) of Hogwarts
Il come back in a bit, waiting for the train

03Sailor Moon is good
03I liked it

03granted I only watched the "classic" series
11cowhead..turtles...what?
MFW streaming for a whole 24 hours now.
Funfact:The Punisher is Eminem's favorite super-hero.

Pokemon's anime is garbage now
03but it's still pretty good
yeah xD
The Punisher rules.
03I actually gave BW anime a try
03Ash acts like he's 2
12again
12:P
to me its been garbage since the end of the fifth season
03I liked it til Battle Fronteir
03again, Veronical Taylor or GTFO
03-l
11which movie?
He commits suicide in an alternate Marvel universe.
11the early 2000 version or the Warzone sequel?
The 2000 version.
11Nittany: *brohoof*
I haven't seen Warzone.
03haha I just cheated at a minigame
03YAY TURBO BUTTON?
11Warzone is shit. And I don't even have to watch it to see.
11to know, not see.
11BONER
ERECT PENIS.
03I liked AG
11XD
11I'm laughing.
Another A-movie idea: The Punisher.
Also, why are they rebooting Spider Man?
11Boner.
The last trilogy was good.
I think Hollywood is just out of ideas now.
those are trash
and DP
Or are just playing it safe by not being innovative.
11Because they fucked up the third movie too much.
@Next Wave:Bronyism.It cures side pain.Take THAT Next Wave!
Like the gaming industry.
Johto, got those sets too
11Even though all they had to do was bring Venom back and BAM!
11I watched that show.
03you got the crappy telecined sets
03but w/e
THOSE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE NOT FREAKING RARE
SciFi Channel:Because poor literacy is kewl!
seriously $120 for just THREE EPISODES!?
no thanks
Next Wave?
MFW it's possible to run out of ideas when you can do absolutely anything in a film/game.
11agreed, Linkara.
oo
MFW AAA industries are mainly profit-driven.
When you care mostly about money, you don't want to take risks.
the region 4 PAL sets are a great deal easier to obtain
11I think Watchmen is overrated...
12o-o
11but that's my opinion.
11...
because unlike Viz, Magna Pacific actually is consistent with releasing things
11Sexual misadventures...
You just keep milking the ones you have.
That's why CoD is yearly, and that's why Halo is being re-booted.
Lost Girls:It's clopfics,just without ponies.
03as EW MOTION BLUR
03*:P
11 95 fucking bucks?! o.O
Except Kotick is just a greedy bastard that admitted years ago to yearly IP exploitation.
HAUNTED VAG TIME!
I want to have legit copies of as much as I ccan get
*can
and besides, you got royally ripped off
dari http://www.petitiononline.com/p1nk13pi/petition.html
11<.<
03actually not really
03a good half of them I got at the list price of $14.99 each
03from a store that had a huge surplu
03s
11your vagina is haunted.
this is why I did not get the Master Quest sets from the US
price gouging
and scalping
My day has been made.Thank you Linkara.
Seems like a good idea.
03see
But I'm wondering, has a petition ever actually worked?
03the Master quest sets I bought from a brick and mortar store for $30 each
03now
11Candy vag is good vag.
11...did I say that out loud? <.<
No harm in trying I suppose.
03I'd like to replace mine as they're getting a little scratched up
03if you want them I can give you mine XD
Edible vag?
Vag?
03and replace my sets
Oh nvm
you would have to get the discs resurfaced
03no
NWM
03they aren't that badc
*NVM
03-c
03the yall work fine
03just minor scratches
if you did that and they skip on ANY DVD player I have
they are coming right back
03they're in good enough condition that DVD Decrypter rips them without giving any errors.
03That's all I cna say, really
03*can
Wow 2750 signatures, that's good.
plus I already have the region 4 PAL Master Quest set
mhm
and a DVD player that works with them
Bye everyone.Enjoy the line-up that i posted.
You think haunted vags are bad, try a vagina dentata
03well whatever you want
03I wanna see if I can get them for a reasonable price
03the score from the first Transformers movie
03is uber rare and out of print
Yeah.
03so I just bought 5 of them
03with shipping it's like $120
03imagine if I sell them at $50 each, keeping one for me...
But apparently "pink ponies sell better". :/

It might be as cool as The Matrix was around it's time.
11BONER!
11You have to pay close attention in the first half.
Which is still my favorite movie.
The Matrix and its sequels were good

I'm going to build an awesome one when I get the cash.
Nice.

that's when I get the money...
I'm looking at about an 850 budget

It works pretty good on my craptop
I don't have to worry about viruses, etc...
I missed it then
I have suse 11.4 I think.

I need to run sfc /scannow some time.

I've used all of the accounts that were made to start with on my computer.
This was my sister's old account. XD
lol.
hard to maintain, very sensitive to viruses and crap.
Not really.
Yeah.
Web server, IRC, etc.
and its an irc serve too?
cool :D
I wish I knew more about computers than I do. They are one thing I want to know more about.
Oh yeah, DNS server too.
I don't know anything about servers. or coding.
It's fairly easy to pick up.
:O
Hi.
Yep.
I don't learn well from articles.
You don't really need to read articles.
You just have a look at some really well commented code.
See how it works.
Disect it.
mfw I don't have to read articles
*facehoof*
You can also learn a lot just be experimenting.
Yeah.
by*
I'm going to start searching for a donor desktop soon.
Do you host any websites dari?
Well if I hosted sites myself they wouldn't be very fast (and my not be set up such that it's well protected).
03gg
I tend to host websites on my computer only as tests.
:<
To show people how a website I've made looks.
Then I'd set it up on free web hosting (which is actually pretty damn good).
03o.o
/me isn't leaving

Net split.
Lawl.
?
why am I still here?
Because two servers on the network just disconnected from each other.
Well, two or more I suppose.
Because there was a net split.
Servers reconnected.
Why?
XD
We were separate from them because we were on charazard.
We seem to be some of the only people on it. XD
oh I think I got it
MFW everyone is pinging.
the rest are hooked up through the dragonite server I guess
and what's with the pinging? :P
To make sure you are still connected.
If you don't respond to a ping for the set time (usually 120 seconds), the server disconnects you.
Netsplit again.
I see.
hmm
servers are being silly huh
well anyway
since me and are you are close in age
I might do pharmacy.
Its a very stable profitable field over here
I can't imagine myself working in any job for a long period of time that's not computing.
It's only 7 years over here.
:P
pharmacy is 6
over here
the US is pretty tough on doctors... There's a lot of foreign ones now.
I'd assuming shadowing other doctors, etc.
because they train in another country for 2, then transfer their license from whatever counrty and start making a ton of money.
hi Kosovoeon

XP
I liked XP best.
Vista is just horrible.
Vista is horrible.
I hate it.
Vista was a mistake XD
and I don't care much for 7 because its not as modifiable as XP.
It's like a mac or something.
"LOOKS PRETTY, MUST BE GOOD"
Wut.

You can't...?
I didn't even know that. >_>
oh. yeah. You can't uninstall it like any other program.

aurelelia left before
but anyway.
Damn.
:P
I got them the wrong way round then.
oh XD
Haha.
Dunno.
yeah its kinda annoying during the stream, but its ok at times like this.
Cool.
:3
Went to see my friend's band play the other day.
well that's good you are going out for something you like as a career
oh that's cool
They're really good.
I want to join a band when I go to college/university
Got any videos of them?
My friend's even played in front of 1000 plus people before.
:O
Nah, but their EP is going to be finished soon.
wow
They're getting it recorded at the moment.
That's awesome.
I don't know if I like pharmacy that much... its just a job I guess
Well, I wouldn't call a computing job work anyway.
I'd probably do half my job in my free time. :P
lol.
yeah.
Oh.
they are usually a percentage, with anything above 70 considered passing.
Except they aren't really at all important.
Colleges/universities look at how you did in high school.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_gt6OJc6Ec&feature=related
In terms of that, you'd get a 1-5 for achievement (1 being highest), and A-E for effort.
With effort I'd usually get low pretty much all subjects.
Achievement, I'd get fairly average, because most people at our school don't during the majority of school.
Without hopefully sounding too conceited, we don't have to.
hmm
yeah.
you do*
Though there isn't that much of it.
there's a lot of it for us.
but I usually only do enough to get by.
The education system here is designed for the average person
I'm not really sure about ours.
and I find it extremely easy.
That's really good.
But as long as I stay in about the 7th percent I don't care much.
And people are our school are supposed to be in the top 5% for intelligence in the UK.
at*
No, it's a grammar school, I don't think they exist in the US.
Drf
I got it lol
03Nice
hence "private"
Some have entrance exams, some don't, it just means they're fee paying for us.
Then yeah, public schools are government funded, no entrance exam.
03yeah
03same with the IMAX here
I wish the US did something like grammar school.
Grammar schools tend to have a more 'classical' education.
They are too "every child deserves the same education"
And English of course.
03Fail
03it was a dome screen?
03I HATE those
but the only way they can do that is if they make the materials very simple and easy to understand.
And you also have the option to take subjects that aren't available in other places.
wow.
That's pretty cool.
It actually isn't too bad
Normally they are
This time was decent
The material here is made for, like I said, the average intelligence and its honestly boring
03well
03Harry Potter was clearly not intended for a dome screen LOL
This is try
Ki yu xd vb ooo
Hmm, the American education system interests me.
But I got the song woot
Like yourself.
Do you have anything between highschool and college?
I haven't met a stupid one XD
In America.
Hmm.
Or if you are an idiot you drop out of high school all together.
After the age of 16 education becomes optional in the UK.
wow. Its "mandatory" until you are 17/18 here.
you*
hmm
Then after that at 16+ you are working for A levels.
Interesting.
03uh
03she already left
Or you could leave to go to another secondary school, which has a sixth form.
14LOL
That makes sense.
Or college, which over here is a school that exclusively deals with education from 17-18, A level time.
The system here, you go through grades 1-18, then you graduate, and move on to college if you want.
Hmm.
I mean 1-12.
Sorry.
You go to school until you are 17/18.
High school is considered grades 9-12.
Oh.
College.
You can actually drop out at 16 in the us.
it's just.. highly unrecommended.
it is discouraged though.
yeah.
School after grade 12 is called college, and the schools are called universities.
O_o
It costs a lot.
Ok.
or you can go to a technical school and it costs less.
:3
Yeah, university is expensive here to.
We used to have polytechnics over here in the UK.
too*
yeah technical school also.
but I don't think they are as good as college.
Student fees are something like tripling over here for university the year I'm going. >_>
Mainly for technical degrees.
like you could be a licensed mechanic or technician.
that sucks dari...
It is all I wanted.
Non-G4 ponies.
Wut.

Oh yeah, I am upset about that though.

Ok, if I did a 3 year course.
12guess she didn't want to talk to you drf
03:(
03Not in the mood for jokes x.x
I could be about £71,000 in debt, which is $115,648.
Enjoy elephants again.
T_T

I can't hear you very well
College is pretty expensive over here too, not sure about numbers.

THEY WERE SPYING ON US
Welp, that sucks.
ha.

12It really depends on the university however
dumb fabric
wwwhoa?
oh?
03yeah but I've never heard of a university with a 3 year program
03usually it's 2 or 4, or even more if you want a master's degree etc
12Because some university’s in the US would have you in even more debt
Yeah, we have 3 year courses in the UK.
Back on stage girls.
livn' in uhpawney worl'
Don't you have 12 year courses in the US?

02Just PS1
03some people have said you can play them
03others said it doesn't work

Which is some consolation.
Why?! Why must I have a presentation today?!

12<3 Liiiiiiiiiiiiink
school project most likely
It seems like they have a lot of time on their hands.
to kick me.
Because we are anticipating when we stream S2 episodes live we'll have even more people.
and to kick polar
We have to present our recommendations around the strategic plan for a local summer camp.
You managed to find all the Equestria Daily banners?
Mainly to kick polar
and yeah I recognized that.

02I like the second top comment on that
03well the preview was in 3D
whats that?
03so I dunno
03it could have just been a conversion though, it happens a lot
03which i hate

that
that's grade-A badassery.
03movies that are filmed in 3D, fine, but if it's just converted... do not want

Unfortunately
I only have the McDonald's toys at the moment
Nice
Though they're coming to the US.
Nothing for the UK. T_T
I see only G3 pony toys here
The McDonald's ones are the only G4 ones
McDonald's ones haven't come here yet.

10hiya
10lul
I hate CSS ):
10Same, as I hardly know how to edit it
I do but doing the profile thing like on TST is annoying
takes too much time
10Fixing up the code for profiles?
oh lol
I'm lazy :p
it has about 1000 bugs
and I'm sure I've left things out because I'm lazy and couldn't be bothered to be thorough
10Heh
good luck
it's messy as crap
10I don't care, since my current old profile code is screwed up too
10:P
10Hm
uh
You can change it.
a:hover is when you mouseover them
10k
a:visited controls that
if you read my post, a:link which is the unclicked hyperlinks
I'll fix it tomorrow
You gunna start streaming now?
everything's ready on my end
Ok.
7and here I thought you went resting :o
I've only slept four hours getting all the episodes, but no matter
I've tested the playlist, everything's in order
Wow.
Dari
you
I just stopped streaming now.

And now we're having a 10 hour pony stream.
I slept during one of the videos, it was 13 hours long.
XD
We watched some Adventure Time (which I thought was pretty creepy O_o).
PMVs
An hour of someone counting.
An hour of myomyomymom.
Something called linkara.
And a lot of videos in some plalist.

Got blackmailed into singing Winter Wrap Up. XD
And read part of some fanfic.
WB
11Allo.
Already am. :P
11Just sent the Monday Email.
7lots of background noise I hear
11I hear it too.
disconnected a cable
how about now?
30 FPS, going to use 350 kbps because people were complaining it lagged
some people just didn't have a good enough connection, but yeah
7still hear the background noise
7pony image looking great
7gone now
how about...kay
11It was lagging for me last night.
Gone.
now tell me about the stream's volume
11Who was streaming then?
No more background noise.
7great
11BG STatic noise is gone.
11Napping.
I can turn up the volume a bit more up if you want
Looks good from my end.
Volume good on my end too.
7looks excellent
11Volume's great.
Sudden quality drop?
7yep
that's due to the action scene
11Quality is a bit fuzzy now and then, but that's expected in stream.
that's why I hate streaming at lower-than-possible quality
http://www.nhne.org/news/NewsArticlesArchive/tabid/400/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/4220/language/en-US/Lightning-Strike-Turns-Surgeon-Into-ComposerConcert-Pianist.aspx <- oo

/me 11derped. XD
MUCH GOOD!
XD
not sure if should stream in 500
not MANY but still
11Much good, yes.
11That's likely because of connection.
do we have
an /oat/ thread?
11no thread on oat.
someone please get on that
11just discussion thread in /chat/
11can do, yes.
also please mention the fact that the stream's signal is set at 564 kbps
11okay.

Hi
*Technical
How was last night's stream?
There was a stream last night?
Hey.Atop the 4th Wall episodes played last night.
*Yeah
I've been streaming different things from the end of the Saturday stream till now.
Oh well, In that case I'll have to stick around longer after the movies end this week.
I made last night's line-up happen.
/me 11goes to watch some AT4W until the event starts. :D
Here it is!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71YsRO6G7Ks&feature=channel_video_title
It's called "Cowboys & FreddieW".
Sorry.
9nah s'okay
11We're not in the middle of an event and there's no stream being played....
(lol Derpcraft joke)
06Are the awards bugged or something? o.o
06Or perhaps some of them are just not permanent :P
10Only displaying one? Probably
10Hi Ecco

11OBJECTION.
11^ obligatory.
I don't remember hearing this song before

Can't remember if it was someone here that showed me this, but oh well.
I'll post it anyway.
11HEY!
11DCD!
11I WAS HEADBOBBING!
9KEIKAKU DOORI
11Destructor236: It's a selling ploy that they've always used. They made, like, fifteen different versions of Street Fighter 2 before moving on to Street Fighter III
11The problem is that....IT FUCKING WORKED!
11Not once, but TWICE!
They only made 3 SF3's as far as I know
9yeah and the SF3's were a bit different in that regard
9they were actually sequels of one another
9that said
9I don't know
9perhaps the only way I'd forgive Capcom is if they undo everything they've done this past week
9localize Investigations 2
11Release Investigations 2
Elena is wierd.
9she was also fun to play
I trust you.
HEALING?WTF?
That's worst then Gill's Resurection bullshit.

I'm not streaming. :P
11They're two entirely different styles of animation.
It's a song.
9because they're both animation/cartoons, and ergo the same medium
11It's different styles though.
9yeah
ARGH
11It's like saying American Superhero Comics are exactly the same as Manga.
Kinda like hating on oil paintings :P
9the key word is
9"Hate"
9you can say "I dislike anime's tropes" or something
>translation
>what
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wavpWRK6IX8
This is hilarious.
9but when you go around hating on anime like that, yeah...
9I mean
9it's like
9hating on people because they like cartoons
9and yet, YOU like Cartoons
06girl = negative
06boy = positive?
9in that sense, there should be no distinction
06?
/me runs
;P
9you can say "it's not my taste" but not openly antagonize people for their likes
You could still argue conceptual and stylistic differences and still get away with it.
And there's getting to be less and less difference between american and japanese cartoons nowadays too.
9yeah, but he wasn't doing that
9he was just being...well, you get me
Thanks for playing the request by the way.
10Girl should be positive
10Girls > boys
/me hides
I BE TRIPPIN.
9well in Agito there was a tofu HANDLING-off
COMPOUND THOSE PIRATES
THEY DRIVE ME TO FIGHT
Getting tofu to not taste like crap? That's hard.
Don't forget the rum.

9Tofu tastes like egg to me
Q'APLAH
9at least the one I've eaten

I misread ranJ as rant
xD
Ultraman is awesome.
I thought I was watching Japan's take on Crysis for a moment.
9but yeah. He was coming across as intolerant of other people's likes as well as other cultures
9IF YOU WANT TO BE A MAN!
9FIGHT FOR SOMEONE YOU WISH TO PROTECT!
9SAME FOR THE WOMEN!
9NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN IF YOU JUST STAND IN THE SIDELINES AND WATCH!

It's just temporary, after you get out of the tank. Still bugged me.
9>/THREAD
hey guys.
9that kind of fits with our last incident

Maybe the reason why it never happened to me was because it was the PS2 version i played.
