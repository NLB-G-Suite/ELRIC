/me sees MeanwhileStatue.
Must know
96.5% more wub wub
fluttercry: Oh no D: is your house alright?
fluttercry: What happened?
i think the voice works very good
i didn't like her voice too :'(
/me makes "You shouldn't have done that...." Echo through Meanwhile 's mind.
lets agree to disagree
05,15It's fine now, but someone in the apartment upstairs let their toilet run, and it ran down the walls and into my apartment.
/me likes Derpy's voice
.....
>.>
that sucks
ewwwww
ew
TOY_PON3: i agree
05,15And I had to move everything out of my room and sleep on the couch
/me can't hear MeanwhileStatue over the usual voices in his head.
...

The voice is too cl- wait I already said thais last night
That's a big toilet.

The4thwall|shower: are u taking a shower right now?

/me transforms into him as a statue
/me stands tall
Chickensnake thing?
one does not simply tell Wrek to fix something
Cockatrice
05,15On the bright side I finally got around to cleaning and rearranging my room
Yay

Enjoy, Wrek!

05,15Later Wrek!
05shut the fuck up untill its done, once its done you can complain, not during
have a nice food
:P
Bye Wrek
Well said. c:
Lol rainbow got told
Well, you got told.
But there's nothing TO complain about
Dat herdmind.
Yeah rainbow, no criticing until its complete :$
05,15Wrek laying the smackdown on fools
Youre gonna need some butter cause your buns just got toasted :P
^ :D
HA!
Thanks for reminding me about the smell of butter TOY_PON3 ¬_¬
I pity the fool who complains while Wrek is drawing.
Mind if i steal that, TOY_PON3?
Besides. It's a fucking amazing picture. I wouldn't beable to do that.
Meanwhile: :D
Can anyone link me to Wrek's DA?
Excuse me >< Anypony*
why was Wrek cussing?
SayWhat: Go ahead
Bluestrom_S: Someone was complaining about his drawing
Well I'm gone ya'll.
The poor fools
unfoundbug Thank you
*foals
wait. what's wrong with his draw- *goes to bronystate*
Gah! You're right. What's wrong with me? ><
Eurostream in 50 minutes :3
okay? but did that justify saying "shut the fuck up" to them?
True
that Fluttershy drawing... dear god
but you shouldn't be lashing out to your viewers like that
no matter so annoying they can be
why can't I steal someone's skills like they did in Space Jam
looks like I missed some drama
05,15CountDoofus become Kirby
Besides, until the creator says otherwise, you aren't really allowed to criticise their creative works.
Indeed
Wrek is mod, he does as he pleases :D
But mods have limits too RaveBrony
Who watches the Watchmen?
TOY_PON3 not really, they enforce the rules
viewers can say what they like or don't like, if your hosting (streaming) you cant just say to people "shut the fuck up"
what if people started saying shut the fuck up to wrek or the other mods?
Bluestrom_S You can, but it's not wise.
yes they can its their stream
it wouldnt go so well
Yeah, but meh, I lash out too when people critic my drawing (mainly becuz they arent worth garbage)
05,15Look maybe Wrek went to far. Maybe not, but just let it go.
So i understand his ways :P
unfoundbug: If a mod doesn't do it's job other mods can vote to demod you or ban you
o.o
Or atleast I think it works that way
and then we lose one of the best streamers
They're just bronystate mods, not military training instructors. They're not supposed to be held to a higher standard.
unfoundbug: Of course
%Fluttercry is right. Let it go.
....bronie's are kinda edgy today, it seems
Tovler: Exactly
Inb4 some ponies get Da Boot for continuing the convo :D
That's kinda untrue Tovler.
Tovler Lol Like MTI's are held to a higher standard
05,15No no no one's getting the boot. I'm just asking everyone to let this go.
So, we meet again, my old nemesis - Wheel of Buffering.
It makes sense to hold people in positions of power to higher expectation, but Wrek is...well, Wrek.
fluttercry: Will do
Oh, ok :3
so, how bout them ponies
^
Dark_Horst Well, what do you expect? no ponies this week XD
Would probably be a good idea for someone to take the reigns of the stream to take viewer's minds off of the topic
So who likes Derpy?
:3
Except ValtheJean. He's kind of a policeman-ish mod.
I.E. play a vid or something
well then, everybody aqueeze a beanbag or something
TOY_PON3 really?
Val hates Trixie, he is automatically absolved of all wrongdoing.
this convo... again...
unfoundbug: Lol I know everypony does :D
BTW,
Well, im still confused... who is TRULY best pony?
Val hates Trixie? :(
05,15SO WHO LIKES PONIES
I should mention, that i was syndicate...
if you have a resposibily to keep mod or viewer otherwise to need to keep to those resposibilities especialy if your a mod because you need to show/lead your viewers in the proper etiquette
all except TOY_PONY, he may chew on a brick that has "i will not bring up controversity in the chat" written on it
already pretty sick of the argument, unless it goes down on hubworld or somewhere more official than itunes
Anyone with a working brain hates Trixie.
I LIEK PONIEZ
I<3 ponies
%fluttercry I DO
Val says Trixie should die in a fire
ponies? you serious?
its just apple covering their asses
Meanwhile I...kinda like Trixie
fluttercry: i does!
I say Trixie should be run over with a steamroller.
luna best pony!
^
Dark_Horst: Yeah thanks bro :|
you're welcome B
I myself was offended that he lashed out like that because someone complained about he's drawing
05,15That's a funny way to spell fluttershy unfoundbug
*B)
good old viewers, attentions spans of a goldfish lol
I lik Twilight and Pinkie
05,15Bluestrom_S Seriously let it go
Mods here are mods for their tech skills and refreshing personality. not some moral code.
Trixie is OK, but I have always said that Silverspoon and Diamond Tiara should be forced to fight to the death and then we kill the winner
so why do you liek poniez?
but discord rules them all
fluttercry: you can't just say let it go and assume that fixes it.
Morning everyone.
Dark_Horst: Sorry if I started it :(
Engage the dialogue and work for an answer.
Placebo: <3
05,15Well it really does need to stop. It's just going to turn into a big issue, and it really doesn't need to
fluttercry, nope i just dont think fluttershy is best, i believe she is third on my list
somehow i'm getting the feeling that certain events suudenly have us all twitching in our seats today
I agree with fluttercry
Don't insult art and don't expect manners especially on the internet. The End.
yes, the derpy issue has us all finiky
or most of us
I also agree with fluttercry
ok I'm going to shut up, I just wanted to say what I wanted to say
^
Now I have to rewind. I was watching Archer
Man this is because we don't have a new pony episode today! :(
^^
^
Resolution. So anyhoo.
Its tearing us apart! :(
imagine what it'll be like when season 2 ends
=3
indeed TOY_PON3
Pinkie Pie is best pony.
and we have six months of downtime
Why can't we all just get along?!
05,15The Great Pony Draught 2
sundaysmile like this :[
^
Damn you Discord!! Show yourself!!!
Yoy_Po3 is right
When Season 2 ends, College student will be home and epic PMVs will ensue
TOY_PONY:i think that's what doctors call cold detoxication
Indeed
When season 2 ends, the amount of work done by bronies will take a massive increase
Wait until the delay between seaons 2 and 3.
:o
Oh man....
it's gonna be a bloodfest
unfoundbug: Sk true
So
so, lets find a tf2 server to flood with ponies
Then you can complain about being denied new pony.
^
Yay tf2
Plus, it'll be summer. Summer Summer Summer Tiiiiem
watching the stream on bronyfunds, you kids go ahead and play ;)
Eternal Summer
Time to kick back and unwind
*facepalm* Today is rather lame
I don't even know summertime anymore.
Meanwhile: I'll be ready for that
is that live?
TOY_PON3 has weed
yay summer :)
o_o
Nope I'm straight edge :3
I hate summer.
I do too
srsly is this live
guys is there something wroung with the stream its not loading...
I love Spring
why ? :'(
not at the moment saske
It's hot and there are bugs everywhere.
My electric bill loves summer.
oooooooooohhhhhhhhh
ok
Its not live, atm. The streamer went to eat dinner
I like winter.
I say we go bring Bronies to a game
it will be live as soon as Wrek gets back from eating
I like the cold and the wind and the ice.
And then no one recognised my Dashie shirt at the ACTA protest.
Hate the wind
i don't like summer that much. against the cold, you can tank up
We need Fighting Is Magic, Now! :D
annoying as hell
but heat? completely at mercy
05,15awww Kammerjunk
RaveBrony: Indeed we do
RaveBrony We need 30cc's of Fighting is Magic, stat!
Seriously, in an area with 12000 people protesting against ACTA, how could I find NO bronies at all?
Kammerjunk: first world problems.
What Kammerjunk?? D:
Meanwhile: I know, right.
Lol :D
Maybe they noticed it but didn't say anything
Poor Kammerjunk :(
I feel bad for you Kammerjunk why would fellow residents of the internet not atleast recognise it
Kammerjunk Likely they just were nervous about being Bronies
Any idea when Fighting is Magic and Ponykart are actually coming out? lol
Perhaps.
^
Closet Brony is worst brony
I agree
Just saying
^
i think the only answer to that will be a "when it's done"
ikr.
oi, some of us have reasons to be hidden
05nom

hi wrek
Hi Wrek

WREK

I live in a country where gays can be married in the church, which is pretty darn neat. People here should be comfortable in their bronydom.
unfoundbug: you're friends with the Pope?
I had a Pasty. :P
unfoundbug same here
i just found something made by DJ pon3
Wrek made me hungry now
unfoundbug My non-bronie friends have either converted, or just laugh at me XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGjvBrRRek&feature=related
isn't "with con" kinda like saying the same thing twice?
Umm ...is anypony's livestream still loading?
I cant find my damn vinyl Sctrach t-shirt :(
frozen for me
*Scratch
Probably because nothing is actually being streamed yet.
mfw I dont have a pony t-shirt :(
^
itd be nice to try to convert, only brony i know of in a hundred miles
05i got a raid now so i wont stream untill after EBMN

BritishBrony: It costed me around a hundred dollars to get two brony shirts shipped to Denmark.
Crap. D:
Kammejunk Try being a Brony in alaska
Yay for Drunk playing :3
Sky_Pirate_Brony: No shiz, but I want to know what he's raiding and whether I might have some input.
At least my wife is a pony fan to..

Wrek Drunkenly Wrecks Deus Ex?
I'll be there.
(neat. Nisemonogatari is out.)
So I went to Wal Mart the other day and the blindbag pony box was empty. I asked a worker if she could check if there is a toy in stock. She screamed across the store to someone else "This man is looking for a toy". So glad I didn't say I was looking for a My Little Pony because that would be akward to hear screamed across the store
i was referring to AFTER deus ex
THIS MAN IS LOOKING FOR MY LITTLE PONY.
Midnight_Fyre: Did you laugh at her for her ignorance?
noooooooooo. They changed Derpy's voice? oh come on!
sounds like pinkie broke out again, eh?
THIS MAN IS A BRONY!
CALL THE PARTY POLICE
Midnight_Fyre: I'd proudly scream that in walmart
It is cute, but I will always know her from the original voice work
no, I just explained to the other lady what I was looking for. There weren't any in stock unfortunately
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2CRjPO73Dg
SOUND THE PINKIE ALARM http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez-OJ4zPfC8
You should totally have laughed at her.
do you think that store clerks are starting to notice more grown men bying MLP toys?
i'd be screaming that in a walmart too.... mostly because i live on the other side of that whole lot of water, but hey, details
CCCP probably all use the excuse it's for their daughter or something
And then told her to look up "bronies".
Sky_Pirate_Brony: ya
Well, I just asked her if she could check on a toy, and then she called to the other lady who is in charge of toys
Oh.
05,15I still need to check my McDonalds
It's like that.
http://i.imgur.com/925X7.gif
wait WTF? derpy got a new voice?
Bluestrom_S: woah
Dude.
Here we go again XD
I used to do a pricecheck on some of the most embarassing items when I worked in a store
yeah, new voice
I can see infinite.
the horrible thing is: the pony merge over here is a fucking trainwreck
I think the McDonald's toys don't start until March
enjoy
http://i.imgur.com/UooHK.jpg
*merch
11,01I'm back.
is there no stream atm?
Yeah, they're not selling ponies over here.
McDonalds still has the old Star Wars toys. Just came from there.
AW MY EYES
Wb Nittany_Discord
god help you if you came to my register with a tube of "Itch Cream"
welcome back Nittany_Discord
They will have new toys March 5th
Midnight_Fyre Wait, wait, wait...Pony toys?
http://www.bronyfunds.com/?page_id=13 Anyone?
Let me rephrase.
Hey guys, if you're bored without a stream, check out: http://www.bronyfunds.com/?page_id=13 and join #bronyfunds , where we're raising money for a former bronystate mod who's landed on hard times
We should all change our voice in protest. I'm talking like Bullwinkle until this is reversed.
They're not selling ponies with Happy Meals over here.
At McDonald's? Yes, they are coming in March
BritishBrony: made my donation already.
Placebo: I would, but I'm broke until the 1st.
:/
i personaly dont think that they should replace derpy's voice but is it really that bad?
i have my hopes that by some impossibility of marketing the mecdonalds ponie will swap to here
but that's a small hope
CCCP have you seen the edit yet?
CCCP I think they should replace it, BUT derp it up a bit
11,01I'm fine with the voice replacement. Not so much with the rest.
yes i just did
Derpy should talk in G major.
I find it amusing that the new voice is cute and would fit her, but I now know Derpy with the "original" voice
11,01XD
All the time.
What flutter_spin said
It'd be like her normal voice.
I know that feel bro
11,01G major Derpy XD
agreed. the voice is nice. eyes not. namecensor not
i loved her voice
Heya Everypony :)
Allo Pyrexo
Agreed Dark Horst
especially when she said ARe you okay R
The new voice is OK, though the old one really grew on me, but removing her name was unforgivable
11,01That would be possessed Derpy.
especially when she said ARe you okay RAinbobw dash? anything i can do to help?
Nittany_Discord: I still think it should happen.
Oh yeah Derpy! Terrible about the new "The Last Roundup"
wow type fail
I have the original on my harddrive.
Should've left her name intact.
Oh though the hub's fan inbox was shut down soon after the news was released
i just want to know who came up with this. just to ask for a reason. i want to understaaaand
/me loves how she cheerfully and disingenuously says "My Bad" now.
05,15We should take Hasbro...and BURN IT DOWN
Yep.
EQD noted that the DVD will still have the uncut version
11,01Don't spread blame yet.
/me hits fluttercry with a cinderblock.
it was reopened an hour later but was shut down again
Dark_Horst: Because the voice actor thought Derpy was male.
presumably their inbox was full...
05,15ouch
05,15I never get to start a riot :(
Derpy....male...?
but that'S not the reason for cutting the name and fiddling with the eyes
11,01Hasbro's probably shut it down due to the incoming mail.
:S
dont worry comrades one day Derpy will rise from the ashes back to her former glory
Kinda extreme, don't you think fluttercry?
http://escism.net/omfgdogs/
indeed
Oh right, it was Tabitha.
05,15...that's the joke Midnight_Fyre
11,01I'm sure a lot of it is hate mail sadly.
I know, so was my post
Bluestrom_S: :D
Bluestrom_S: that should come with a warning.
Nittany - most of it was automated mail send via the petitions
I don't see anything on the screen, is the stream currently down or am I lagging?
When I hear "Tabitha", I just automatically think Black Mountain Radio.
its rainbows of dogs
05,15WTF did I just see
sent*
you! ameribronies! stalk thiessen!
Not streaming right now
/post warning
find out!
Bluestrom: :O Should've warned us it was dogs
doggies :3
Ameribronies? I like that
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/derpy-has-been-modified.html
11,01I like that dog gif.
Should've warned us it can cause seizures.
lmao thank you Bluestrom
It's so hard to find my Dashie cursor in that rainbow dog thing.
REGARDING DERPY: i stumbled upon something that might ease your minds
yes?
That an animator said she'd be ok
Also: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/01/new-falloutequestria-side-stories.html I guess for you Fallout MLP guys
CCCP just linked it
already read it
Kammerjunk Dashie cursor?
it does not ease my mind
I want it.
Derpy_Hooves: oops didn't see
/me shudders when he hears "Love and Tolerate"
Sky_Pirate_Brony: Hold on.
Derpy will be fine...Faust and the team love us, remember
Looking at some graphic equalizers for my laptop. I like the look of Realtime equalizer, does anyone know of another program out there?
I -think- I can find it again.
It's easy to say love and tolerate, it's a lot harder to actually do it.
She'll be fine...? As in...?
it's an airy definition
Pyrexo she'll be her normal derpy self before long
I know somepony on BronyState made it.
But I'm having difficulty remembering who.
Kammerjunk don't worry about it. Thanks though.
made what?
05,15I'm just afraid that they will never shout out to us again after all this
It was Flaria wasn't it?
Yes!
05,15because I know I sure as hell wouldn't
o-o
Flaria.
Flaria
/me drowns his screen in Derpies
deeeeerp
they might but it will probably be not as blatant
Derpy's*
Sky_Pirate_Brony yay :D then why are people getting angry?
maybe renaming heartstrings to Lyra or something
i'm still kinda scared. because now it looks like a few screamers without reason have won. and i'm afraid that might happen again
Pyrexo Because it's not for sure. I'm just saying I doubt they'll let tit go..
tasting blood and all
Oh, the naming situations?
Derpy getting new voice
NO
just
NO
Mmm We can only hope :)
The thing that really concerns me about the whole Derpy thing is that they are going to be less likely to give out fanservice like that in the future, and likely start focussing more on the target demographic
Is there an offical response on what the issue was and why it was changed?
Hope is an immensely flimsy thing.
I like my current derpy
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2CRjPO73Dg if you missed it
It was already confirmed that derpy would never speak again.
It was changed because of an outcry that it was offensive
Derpy getting a new voice? I've gotten used to the first one already, albeit disliking it first time round
Was it?
it's also unlikely that she'll speak again
Midnight_Fyre I REALLY doubt that. They started with us, and they KNOW they'll lose 90% of their audience if they dropped us.
whos streamning?
Tovler That's, sadly, more likely.
and that really rustles my jimmies. a lot
True, but if they 'dropped' us, would we really notice?
Hasbro has YET to release an official statement, it's only been comments from the animators and staff
Derpy is best secondary
05,15Sky_Pirate_Brony I'm pretty sure we don't make up that much of the commuinty
Meanwhile: yeah
They could completely ignore the fandom in every possible way, it'd still be MLP.
05,15in fact I'd say really we're a very small fraction
I wasn't there when Derpy was made. So I guess that kind of takes some of the glamour away from her.
It's not like they'd stick a sign on the start of each episode "You're weird if you're watching this and over 14 years old"
And now future shows will be afraid to embrace their fandoms.
I don't know many that do?
A small fraction can ruin an engine
Is it just me, or is there nothing on the stream and it's just buffering?
:( true
nothings on
Nothing is streaming.
%fluttercry The side demo is what makes most of the fanbase...If they acctually made it that it was more chilidsh and girly..
not yet anyway
no livestream
the same way a small fraction can start a revoultion
but if this small fraction never voices, nothing will happen
Be prepared for nothing to happen then.
and do what? boycott MLP? and risk putting it out of business?
the bronies are what made the series big, hasbro noticed that and started coming towards us. if worst case scenario of them driopping us would come through, it would be noticable
you want that?
Hasbro response: Look at Princess Cadence. Isn't she beautiful and she's getting married!
woot! stream
Since we lost to some screamy whiners.
uhhh
I didn't mind Derpy's original voice. I don't think I'll mind the new one.
play the boondocs
lol yeh

Without having seen the series, I just gave up on the movie. Stuff just happened for no reason to me. It's like watcingh a random numbered Naruto Movie.
Derpy was killed by HASBRO today. They reuploaded the last roundup. But derpy was no longer mentioned, and was un-derped.
Is this the kind of movie that requires tons of baCkstory!?

Just like in exorcist movie :-D
GO SERENITY
BPPBS\
Update 5: The Last Roundup has been put back up on iTunes. Derpy's name has been removed, and her voice changed so as to not be as silly as it was before. Unfortunately, this means that the name 'Derpy' has been retroactively un-canonized, due to being 'offensive'. Her eyes have also been mostly 'un-derped' in the animation.
tied everything up too abruptly
Sundaysmile: I fear the worst
spider girl spider girl does whatever a spidergirl does can she swong from a web no she cant shes a girl look ooouuuttt she is a spider girl

AttackWithHugs: That's what I'm telling anybody who asks about a new episode this week. Because it's been said 3 million times that THERE'S NO NEW EPISODE.
A movie isnt a movie without a crazy out-of-nowhere fight scene.

05,15I'm so excited for Raiders
thats above the brastrap
RAWRity: I knew there wasn't a new episode this week. That much I knew. I thought it was because of scheduling, like when S2 first premiered.
oh hai regulars of a State of the Brony variety
double!
MY BALLS!
We accept Scott Pilgrim random fight scenes. I smell a double standard
Allo IshBestPony
we accept this too Tovler
Raiders is the first Indiana Jones right?
05,15Scott Pilgrim is best movie
Texas
AttackWithHugs: it is. But at this point people asking has become so annoying, I feel the need to fuck with them a little.
this scene isn't random
Eta kuramna sme
And then she passed out.
it just hasn't been explained yet

Don't say them out loud.
hmm, so it's possible they rescheduled the new ep to next wek because they forsaw the Derpy thing happening and didn't want it to ruin the ep?
TopHat: etocorum nas mei
I bet you'd like to know, ey TopHat ^^
Mr British
I watched RoboCop every day before I went to school for like 2 years and I've seen it about 30 times after that too and I STILL love it (I'm known to get borde of movies fast)
Marx: eenope.
05,15I can't really say I have a favorite movie. but it's for sure up in my top 5
No, seriously. Can a 6 episode miniseries be a B movie?
Marx ,,,i think you were right
Oh well, it was just a thought.
no, tovler.
Tovler: probably not.
lol 90lbs
movies only.
RAWRity: It's because people are now used to episodes airing every single week and it's turning from "I can't waiit!" to "WHEN IS TEH EPISODE DFOFJODHFOHDJACSDF!" People just have no patience at all.
Marx: if they had shown a new ep today there probably wouldn't be as much focus on the derpy thing right now

DAMMIT
05god*
Dat dogsend.
11,01The safe word is Fluttershy.
AttackWithHugs: it's not even that. It's the fact that every single place pony related has a timer set up to TELL these people when the next episode is. And they don't fucking check it because they're morons.
/me glomps everypony in here
The Holy Avenger doesnt like having a flesh bomb on his ship!
I'll pick it anyway. Mods normally ask you to pick a different movie if you're their for the lottery, right?
RAWRity: chill out.
I just looked out my window and its like a blizzard but it was sunny 2 minutes ago
It's like how people don't realize the difference between the timer counting to the euro show, and counting to the episode stream.
Mind control
Or how they can't be arsed to check a damn world clock to figure out their time zone. This is simple, easy to figure out stuff.
WARity: there's a counter to the euro show?

It was printed on a piece of paper. And the guy couldn't pronounce it.

They did an awesome job with the guy's character, but they really push the limit on the humanity / monster morality issue

nicolas cage is perfect for the movie; he plays a character with no soul
Welcome to Reaver space, leave your face at the doorstep.
05,15but are there bees?
Except his kryptonite is BEES
^
Reaver space, where everyone hears you scream
XD
beeeess
so reavers are space pirates basically?
no
buzzz
This reminds me of Star Wars
Speaking of Nic Cage, is Bad Lieutenant an A or B movie?
They explain that in about 15minutes
Space pirate cannibal loonies.
Please let something epic happen.
space cannibals
Sounds like a car alarm.
Reaver space: Even though it's in space, they can stilll here you.
wow
space pirates fear reavers
And the Matrix
space train
Combustiblelemons: if space pirates were completely insane and had hour long rape sessions as they slowly ate people to death.
that was all?
zombie space pirates
i heard a space train
like space cannibal rapist serial killers
Okay, I'm back. what'd I miss?
And a few other movies where they shut everything off
You so impatient. They explain stuff afterwards :P
wow ._. dark
Reavers are utterly insane, they're like space vikings with less morals and more shouting.
AD?!
Attack
reavers sound like cool guys
and noone can kill them?
best match up of cannibals: Painis cupcake vs Reavers
AttackWithHugs: people died
Meanwhile and Much Much more rape
There's a lot of them.
They're human. Technically.
Combustiblelemons: nobody can ever accuse Joss Whedon of being too cheery.
well noone wants to do anything about them?
you can kill em, there is just a lot of em
Do what you want cuz a space pirate is free! You're a space pirate! YAR HAR TEEDLEEDEE! Being a space pirate is alright with me!
it's yoda
lol fair enough
this movie is making me want to play ME3 even more now
Combustiblelemons: They explain stuff here in a moment
good
Eat who you want cause a space pirate's free, you are a space pirate.
Combustiblelemons: It's kind of difficult to kill them, what with the aforementioned murder/rape/cannibalism combo.

go get him nappa
11,01Good anytime!
You made me smile smile smile
good Mornight.
good now
you know...bit odd that they clearly have space age technology, and only have regular ballistic weapons
According the schrodengers cat we can assume that the ship is both dead AND alive.
Why fix what isn't broke Ingwaz.
Nothing replaces bullets.
Kinetic weapons is best weapons.
Ingwaz: they have more "futuristic" weapons, but regular guns are easier to come by.
Hi~ dead room is always dead during eurostream~
you can't beat the old fashioned guns ingwaz
ice beam
Not always
did the chat get killed :O oh no!
Just usually.
What is this place filled with so many white
Ingwaz: Regular balistic weapons work though
Meanwhile: thats the kind of reasoning that keeps us with engines in our vehicles that only operate at 26% efficiency
nv
nvm
Just because we have computers noa doesnt mean we dont use 300 year old gun tech
In the series, most of the shipments (including money) are "marked". It is easier to get standard weapons then advanced stuff
Ingwaz: What a story.
On TV you see spike balls, nail guns, staple guns, death rays, and lazers that the ehro survives but I bet you 10 dollars that if they got shot with a bullet, story over. The ened.
*end
That dead guy has a funny face.
xD
They're sleeping.
Ingwaz: AK47's are a bit out dated but they still work very well and are relativly cheap
11,01They're being dead.
chilling
...Forever
sleeping
they sleeping
ZOMBIES!
indeed KwakLad, but weapons can be made more efficient
Patience. They explain this in a moment.
they're saying...nothing!
Dun dun duuun
… wut?
they speak in tongues!
What a twist
xD
they're dead attention whore
/me feels dizzy
Shes starting to damage my calm.
So they're all saying "Nothing" all the time?
Everybody's dead Dave.
like the word "Nothing"
get up dead bodies! be zombies!
she is starting to damage my car?
Hes deead Jim
My calm
Ingwaz: they can but not everyone can afford the top of he range, so they will take what works and is affordable
She is starting to damage my calm.
ironic theyre rescuing search and rescue
11,01The calm has been damaged!
Repair crews are en route.
There actuallly are lasers, they're just not very common.
when going on dangerous missions, weapons are very important KwakLad
It's life Jim but not as we know it not as we know it
Only elite Alliance troopers use 'em.
/me returns with eggs topped with cheese
now you broke it
well point for you~
/me shrugpony
No you never move the thing
It's life Jim but not as we know it, not as we know it Jim.
If you move the thing everything blows up
oh it's Anya!
their weaponry is archaic, but they have space ships
its the pax
Star Trekkin, across the universe...
the paaaaaax
nooooooooo
Its worse than that, it's the pax :T
Like I said, nothing replaces guns.
TT_TT
they died tripping
the haxxx ?
Pax, pacis.
Dat Latin
...Except swords.
layed down and died
i call hax
ಠ_ಠ
11,01Ahh. A lazy gas.
They were so calm they died.
>_>
Ingwaz: yes, having weapons that you can have that work is important does it matter if your enemy is dead and slumps to the floor or if your enemy dies and is thrown across the room by your weapon? not really as long as they die
If you had to chose between a gun and a sword for a fight, what would you chose?
How very mellow.
that is one damgaed calm
I just noticed the topic lol
whoa
pax? THE PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX *throws a computer into space*
depends is te gun loaded ?
gunblade
reavers?
pax means peace
THEY MADE THE REAVERS GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASP
example
damn
Called it
beavers
the origins of reavers :o
THE ORIGIN OF REAVERS.
rape scene
Playing Terraria, gets pinged by "He's dead, Jim", look back on game and I died there ^^
And this is how reavers came to be.
Om nom nom
pax romana, the roman era of peace
I think Battlestar Galactica had the best futuristic technology balance.
Jim never dies due to pings at home...
All your face r belong to us
A ZOMBIE
And that is how Equestria was made.
lol daibow
Jim that was me, Im sorry bro, Ill pay you in terraria gold for what you lost
lol Meanwhile
I lost the game
FUUUUU
/me hits ApplejackDaniels with a cinderblock.
I lolled DainbowRash
weres the juggernaut and the speedcola when you need it
ew use a bucket
Doesn't matter, had almost no gold on me and I got back anyways
wheres*
or the sink
indeed KwakLad, but, which is more useful, a pistol with ballistic shells, or a plasma pistol that uses ammo more efficiently and is more damaging, most likely stronger against armor as well
I lost the plot. Whats going on?
she was the 10%
Ding
11,01Damn that lazy gas.
Jim thats good, sorry to botheryou anyway
KwakLad: thats like saying that you are okay if you stick with a sharpened stick rather than a steel spear
Jim playing on a server or solo?
NEXT MAJOR SCENE IS AWESOME
Ingwaz: but which is easier to come by when you're flat broke and having to steal everything you can.
ding ding ding
XD
quit dinging
We're playing on a server
omg dings
The drums!

The sound of drums.
Ingwaz: if i cant afford the spear and can kill the guy with my stick then im happy
The never ending drums
I aim to misbehave.
easy on the lens flare, joss
*slow clap*
The noise The Master hears in his head.
yay an actual fight sequence
Lets sing a song!
the bloom is so darned high
Hi y'all.
KwakLad: its possible you can kill them, but, your chances are better with a spear than a stick
/me 11,01explodes
Ingwaz: if i have to be ingenious with how i use the stick, then so be it
ok my name is pinkie pie and i am here to stay....
2 armies vs bitty cannon.

Itty bitty cannon is adorable /)^3^(\
*Rocket to the face*

i hope nothing bad happens to him
NOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Dermathil: it was a joke
Ow
Uh oh.
I know ingwaz
dat girl be fine
Ingwaz: in the show they never claim to have the best weapons anyway, in the series its quite clear the alliance has higher tech weapons, but they are happy with and have their own weapons
dat judas reference

He's such a meanie-pants
11,01Aww: <

REAVER SHIP

Embodiment_Of_Awesom: its a movie based on a show called Firefly
Embodiment_Of_Awesom: it's the movie conclusion to the series "Firefly"
Serenity is a movie that extends past the series
I never watched Firefly.

Get ready for this.
Oh so thats why he called it Firefly in the begining!
Meanwhile: slap that turian council member with a singularity
Firefly is... awesome-sauce

silence in space....
I was like "What?" This is called Serenity
11,01Sneak failed.

damn that's evil
flutter_spin: well, they HAD to. This was the last hurrah as it where.
Nittany: nope, harpoon
yeah. Still sad :(
PRAY they dont end MLP the same way

Nittany_Discord: No, harpoon from Reaver ship.
NEVER!

Well, sort of. It was "in the air" machine thingy but... yeah
Stay positive Jayne.
goldfish
no heavy machinery?
>supposed to stop aggression
Their job isn't to make everybody part of the Reavers. Their goal is to put a little bit of Reaver into everybody else.
>makes people go completely insane and kill everyone
it was chloroform~
Seems legit

mexican*
FLYING KICK
derp.
05,15Because Dari says Rainbow Dash is best pony
shot in back, can still climb... seems legit
.
XD
Ingwaz: The alliance has claimed reavers are the result of people seeing the edge of the universe, and he says at the beginning that He's not interested in secrets, he' interested in keeping them.
i hope for her sake thats a torque bow
Embodiment of awesome why not?
11,01And Dari is right.
CountDoofus: earth pony
No reason. I was just wondering.
because they mispelled twilight
damn how many reavers are on a ship?
Silly dari, that isn't how you spell Pinkie Pie.
nades tiem
05,15Though IMO Rainbow Dash is worst pony
Fluttershy is best pony
shaving cream...future wound sealant
11,01Over 9000?

dingdingdin
08,01AttackWithHugs: only two, i think
silly Dari, thats not how you spell Fluttershy
08,01apart from the society logo
Rarity is worst pony.
Ingwaz: his jobs to stop Mal. Then he'll take out whatever Reavers are in his way.
%fluttercry: I thought photo finish was worst pony
Jaynes hit!
Noes. The faces!
>it's the future

05,15at least not for me
gthen Rarity was best pony
flutter_spin: no. 30 million on planet. .1% became Reavers.
No, its how you spell Twilight Sparkle.
>don't fire at ships till they're in visual range

Most Illogical.
she seems more hyperactive now
i have so much in common with pinkie pie
otakon: since they just moved into a dark corridor, yeah.
Fluttershy is in season 2?
08,01AttackWithHugs: no no, it's cool; if you actually know your shit then i'm all ears for anything you'd like to say

Combustiblelemons: don't say that until you actually see her episodes!
Rarity ishbetpony in season 2 RD isbest pony season 1
AJ is best pony, RD is coolest pony, fluttershy is cutest pony
Bam.

Ooooh this is sad.

The girl snaps and wipes out 250,000 reavers with her hands.
GTFO APPLJACDANEILS
My mom yelled "You Go Girl" during this next part.
Did he died
Yeah
Tovler: Helped RD pick a pet, helped RD save Spike and Rarity.
ApplejackDaniels :[
Yeah

no victory sex?
11,01And now you're a toilet.
Yeah
SonicRainboom: predict the future much?
08,01AttackWithHugs: oh yeah, i know
fluttershy is adorable, twilight is adorkable, pinkie pie is pinkie pie...the list goes on and on

Fluttershy tamed a Manticore and made a dragon cry, you're argument is invalid
indeed
They're Goku and Vegeta. They can take as much as they want.
Ingwaz: because the experiment meant to weed out aggresion in people, but in .1% of the population, it had the opposite effect and made them go batshit angry rage monsters.

River is in no mood for your bullshit.

some jack sparrow swordsmanship there
For some reason that fighting scene reminds me of Kill Bill
05,15that's 3 halves!
that fight scene brought me to tears
^
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: that would be 3 halfs of things
so beautiful
Half man half bear and half pig.
i dont think you can do that
those guys should attack at the same time. That would get her.
Meh, needs more Ip man fighting.
:P
fillyfillyy: i know ~
Srsly what was on the video The Operative watched just now?
:P
Ip Man was awesome.

they don't stand a chance
Stop! You violated the River

So what was the point in getting to this planet?
11,01Lad.
To broadcast the signal.
11,01*lag
It's where Mr Universes equipment is
11,01Nvm
Bloodshot eye
the equipment to "send all"
<_<
dat red eye
So they could broadcast the recording of what happened to Miranda
Dat FUture Tombstone.
And sending the message did what?
They buried universe :o
I want a snow globe grave
River remembered somethinged important on said planet, and they found the origin of the Reavers which was the Alliances fault.
let everyone hear of what the Empire did ... creating reavers
Let the entire system know what about what happened
Reveal the origins of the Reavers to the universal population.
Who's tombstone is the one with the rocket?
05,15I feel like watching this would make more sense if I saw the series
A snowglobe grave with derpy.
^
yep. You need to see the series
Here here
What are we on?
that would be epic.
only one place strong enough to send singals everywhere? seems legit... stupid future
The Alliance are dicks.
ding
.-.
/me he will ding four times
11,01Aww. A 1 bottle rocket alute.
exactly my opinion, fluttercry, i didn't understand much too
Midnight_Tempest: more like only 1 place strong enough that wasn't run by the Alliance.
11,01*Salute
%flutercry: dunno, i've never seen the series but the movie was kinda straightforward
Oh god, is she using PAPYRUS?
and let the shipping begin
/me hugz and nomz everypony
yay new paint job and firefly is fixed
Where did they get the money to fix it?
Yup
The movie was a good standalone, but for more backstory - you need to see the series
Tho it is a little harder to follow the plot and the chat at the same time
indeed.
Sexy tiems
SEXEH TIME
dat sex
no AttackWithHugs, shes using comic sans
SECKS
Papyrus? That's old school.

Yes.

Lol Stallion_of_War
That's the Operative.
How is he alive.
well he never existed in the first place
05,15I still can't get over how much he looks like Nathan Drake
/me is too sexy
AttackWithHugs: Sounds cool. How's that going for you?
so SonicRainboom you predicted the future pretty well back there
05,15I mean...it's WAAAAY to close
It's gotten to the point where our class would point out design errors automatically because our teacher taught us well
oooh upthrust
Dat double meaning.
fluttercry: you do know Nathan Fillion INSPIRED Drake's design right?
fillyfillyy: He was here when the movie was streamed yesterday lol.
whos flying the rust bucket?
fluttercry: surely you mean Nathan Drake looks like him.
Yea, not choosing Nathat to play Nathan would be a BAAAAD idea.
sEPTEMBER: hE DIDNT DIE. tHE GUY PARALYZED HIM AND LEFT HIM FOR THE AREMY.
sorta reminds me of han solo personaly
11,01Green light? RED ALERT!

wow you're a mod now :o
AttackWithHugs: so where are you hoping to go with the graphic design stuff?

Shizuka - Using a TARDIS to help with the drawing ehh?
Also Shizuka, I just saw that card you sent me on dA, it is awesome, thank you. <3
Wait I missed a bit of thise, Simon dead?
13<3
No TopHat if you do that you will be mocked. And then kicked.
TopHat: no, you'll still get kicked
XD
Creepy.
aww dari got a valentine? :P
The first rule of flying is: You don't talk about flying
dawwwww
13nO tOPhAT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH that
I'm still not kicked though
September: Simon's busy having sexy times.
Flight club?
Work for a screen-printing place for a while then probably start my own small screen-printing business.
/me is too sexy for this shirt, too sexy it hurts
Ah.
The second rule of flying is: You don't talk about flying

So River is ... Rarity?
First rule of helicopters. Don't touch anything with your helicopter.
aLL CAPS iSHbESTpONY

Rarity's sane.
13the third rule of flying is: don't stop flying unless you're on the ground
more like fluttershy/pinkiepie
river is batshit crazy rarity
because I love getting my hands dirty. which is why I chose graphic design.
River is Pinkamina.
River is Pinkamena

13so much for that buffer panel
Yes, they are.

If the series was so popular why did it finish so quickly?

One does not simply have an intact ship.
WHat was that?
I just don't know what went wrong!
Shizuka: can you help me?
Im on a drug. Its called ponies.
Curse your sudden but inevitaable betrayal.
at least it got over 5
/me is a model and you know I mean, and he shakes his little tush on the catwalk
good point dari
We shall calll this land.... this land.
13didn't it not get popular until it was cancelled?
Fox didn't think that Firefly got enough views and killed it
11,01It was cancelled.
dis music
no!!! the ad popped up right before that happened i have no idea what it was!
05,15didn't pay attention enough to vote/10

Only famous when they're dead. The irony. XD
13it's the "did terribly on tv, did amazing on dvd"
even though ii came in halfway through
Dem credits
nothing special but it's alright
Adam Baldwin/10
The series was only popular among people with a sense of quality, not the general public that like things such as jersey shore
mlp time?
AD?!
6_9 /20
agreeed flutter_spin
fox screwed up the episode order, had long breaks between episodes, changed the air days and times to much, etc.
later everypony
ja
so what movies got picked for next week?
13aren't there only like seven episodes or something?
Ohai everypony
05,1512
fox tend to fuck everything up though

05,15I think it's 12 episodes
Pony time?
otakon?
OHai, emangamer
otakon: whats wrong
Hai emangamer :)
12 or 13.
i help you otakon
otakon: your internet gain sentience?
fluttercry fox is run by morons and half the people who watch fox are morons
When was the last time Fox cancelled a good show? Heck, when was the last time Fox aired a good show at all?
All my flash applications keep going white
otakon: Whats wrong?
2 millions viewers? That's a low number by broadcast standards.
me love theme that plays when you battle dragons in skyrim i learned the lyrics
Mid.
11,01Also The X Factor, which was thrown out of Britian.
13reinstall flash
Keep going...white?
11,01*Britain
FFirefly was 2001.
Shizuka: okay, but I just updated
05,15When Fox cancelled arrested development...I was done with them
That's racist.
Fox had the same problems coming up with Simpsons... but I guess they worked that out
13sounds like a crash, or a plugin blocking them
/me is impailed by a harpoon. x.x
/me licks everypony :3
That was a while ago
IshSexiestPony is sexiest pony
^
/me is licked?
05,15Arrested Development was one of the funniest shows EVER. And Fox killed it...for Family Guy
That isn't how you spell Princess Celestia emangamer.
fluttercry: well, at least you're finally getting the movie?
there should be another channel like fox but for people who have a brain.
Princess Luna IshSexiestPony...
The only thing I watch on Fox is The Simpsons. Because there's other stuff on TV
/me needs an Adult
11,01Arrested Development was meh.
13never saw arrested development
Hey Family Guy is awesome!
Fox News. Enough said. :P
Meanwhile: that isnt how you spell twilight sparkle
13or... really any sitcom
Shizuka: DO IT NOW...its really REALLLY funny
and networks are still putting their faith in crap like Whitney while shuffling around The Community.
family guy is getting old :/
Moreso now than before. The first few episodes were boring.
emangamer: because you know how to spell?
Nittany_Discord: how dare you
Don't think Arrested Development was really my thing.
13eman i have not watched TV since 2007
I don't even watch TV.
Correction: Family bGuy WAS awesome
can we have ponies now plz?
Shizuka: but its HALIRIOUS
it's funny every now and then but now it's just boring.
Shizuka: and besides you watch ponies...
arrested development wasnt that funny... it was good, but not that great
13and even then i hardly watched it after 2006 when i got real internets
NO TV SINCE 2007! :o
00,10ohhi
13sumica~
Shwos are better later on. When they start they're scared and have to play it careful. Then later when they're popular they just do what they want.
Allo Sumica
I don't watch TV any more.
Really, at this point I know damn well that the Arrested Development movie, no matter how good or bad it is, will NOT live up to expectations of the fans.
11,01I haven't actually seriously watched TV in years myself except when I was in Tulsa.
XD
same here...tv is overrated...only have it for guests
Torrents got fast and youtube began to exist.
Dat speedup.

Not mucvh worth watching
IshSexiestPony is Sexiest Pony

Hes fast forewarding it
warp speed ahead!
11,01My friend kept it on the news channels.

Lol.

That was one of many downward changes in the show
Now what?
facehoofs
then stuff like fast DVD releases, Netflix, and Hulu… yep. eff TV

But the credits song at Cloverfield was amazing.
05,15oh never mind
Ponies like clover
:P
mocern spells are classics huh?
00,10Cloverfield made me motion sick
Cloverfield was OK. A decent monster flick
11,01Secret of my Excess.
upside down heart
A field of clover would be delicious
QUESTION.
05,15Cloverfield was HORRIBLE
That's one horn to pierce through the whole book
ah this ep again?
How does Spike digest gems?
13way way too much shakycam
Cloverfeild :p
Cloverfield was a rental I thought.
he has epic stomach acid
Beetlejuice foar B movie
I thought Cloverfield was pretty funny. especially when you're already slightly amused *cough*
Floor = World's largest shelf
spike is smart
13even on my monitor it's a bit much, and usually i don't get motion sick
Considering the insane hype for Cloverfield, it turned out pretty well.
Cloverfield would've been better with actual filming.
05,15Run dude!
At least Cloverfield was supposed to look shakey. I can't stand movies that use shakey cam for no reason
05,15DUDE RUN GET OUT OF THERE
freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeenz
:3
Cloverfield was one of those movies that is only fu ot watch in a group and criticize MST3K style
Wall of teeeeext!
lul friendz
13i agree meanwhile, if they had stable camera work they could almost have pulled it off
inb4 kicked
wait what was the name of the show we jus watched before this
oh shit, my mom left a plate of orange rolls! hell yes!
wall of freeenz
^
13ORANGE ROLLS
they sort of refined the camera filming idea in chronicle
13GIVE GIVE GIVE
00,10I kid you not I got up and left the movie at one point cause it made me throwup.
aside from the the 15 minutes, which was basically an Abercrombie and Fitch catalogue.

13derpy_pony: OH GOD YES

05,15He'll have to pay for it
everypony says rarity is a harlet for not wanting him to eat it...would be like if someone was going to destroy a very beautiful piece of art and you were an artist
11,01Rarity uses charm.
this is why i am not fond of rarity
anyone notice that crunch when she bit herself? ouch
(you got a heart container your health is now increased by one heart!)
ah yes, The Secret To My Excess, aka "How many times can we draw Rarity with bedroom eyes?"

It was a pain to carve into a pumpkin too

You see, Cavy, it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission
sooo all of you are from Europe?
The llama is a quadruped which lives in big rivers like the Amazon. It has two ears, a heart, a forehead, and a beak for eating honey. But it is provided with fins for swimming. Llamas are dangerous, so if you see one where people are swimming, yell out, "Look out, there are llamas!"

neither, we all know that the METEOR card beats all
because dari fell asleep
Who would win in a staring contest? Chuck Norris or Fluttershy with her accursed STARE.
Chuck Norris single-handedly forced Expendables 2 to be PG-13. … so yeah
FlutterDash because you touch yourself at night
6PM CountDoofus? Sweet, I no longer have to wake up at a proper hour.

Kipkat07: she will rise again
Ingwaz: at the very least, you'd think they'd give you a third of the selling price
and i have to go for a bit, afk
Maybe if publishers didn't insist on their games being sold for 60 dollars, perhaps people wouldn't buy used.
mmmm toast
lag
there is so many sounds that shouldn't be there
How do you all know when these random sounds occur?? Am i lagging? O.o
and then it froze
freezy
frozoee
it froze
I'm laggin' to
RaveBrony: it's Wrek on the soundboard
hahaha\
CCCP: mabye youre right... :'(
Fixing the sync
derpy has kept her eyes
CriticKitten: US gets games for extremely cheap, try buying a game overseas, you'll be begging for a $60 price tag
and lawyers and doctors
that flower stomp
But the publisher loses all right to have a say the moment they sold it off.
HERE COMES TOM
hey, you think with all this arguing , it would've been a PM discussin?
tom?
so, Anger=/=Laughter?
TOM!!!
I have torrents running so of course I'm seeding
Yeah, otakon, but everyone is saying the sound Right as he does it :D

sweet elite slayer on ridgeline
tom is best compresssed carbon
holy guacamole batman!
Ingwaz: That's because publishers hate other countries, it has little to do with used sales.
so gray
Ruin his finish! DO IT!
Kipkat07: u see i think derpy wont ever have a spaeking role again but the artist will find clever ways to hide her like they did in Hearts and Hooves Day
hey, I don't like backseat modding, but you think you guys could take the debate in the PMs?

their so mean :(
craft
FS deserved it
Mine!
But fact of the matter is, when something is sold, the original owner has no right to demand conditions be met on that product. They no longer own it. It's the customer's now.
I didn't. http://www.gameinformer.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Components-UserFiles/00-00-55-19-52-Attached+Files/4572.tumblr_5F00_lrocgkLILx1qfgjtno1_5F00_500.gif

CriticKitten: if the publishers are losing out on a huge amount of potential profit, you cannot really blame them for taking measures to get some of those profits
*grabs croll* BACK, BACK I SAY!
^
twill ight you need more overlords tto defend your book
lol pinkie
looking badass
If the customer wants to sell it to Gamestop for 5 dollars of store credit, and Gamestop then resells for 50 bucks, that's their choice in both cases. The publisher has no say in that, and if they want to curb it, maybe they shouldn't overprice their games in the first place.

toooooiooooooom
I guess you could say, that window got STONED
Hehehe, its even funnier becuz spike doesnt even have wings.... :D
Ingwaz: Yes I can. If they're making a product less convenient for their day-one pre-order purchasers (which they are), then screw them and their "lost profits"
so...you're upset about the publisher choosing to charge $60 for their product but okay with the store only paying a fraction of the original cost?
So much troll here.

Hell, want to cut out the middle-man? Sell games for a pittance and make buttloads of buyable DLC. Gamestop gets none of the money from that DLC, allowing the game to make its money while still providing service to the customer rather than seeing their customer as an enemy. >_>

Lol.
Derpy is chewie
08,01"Intellectual property (IP) is a term referring to a number of distinct types of creations of the mind for which a set of exclusive rights are recognized under the corresponding fields of law.[1] Under intellectual property law, owners are granted certain exclusive rights to a variety of intangible assets, such as musical, literary, and artistic works; discoveries and inventions; and words, phrases, symbols, and designs"
Lolwat?
And indeed most of the time when a company is pushed to court for facing an EULA situation, they would rather change the EULA than bother going to court.

dat luna Midnight_Fyre
No sad Luna!
Stop posting sad Woona winks
rmemember the origin EULA fiasco? the first version of the EULA was downright a gangraping of the consumer rights
Happy Luna is best Luna
/me explodes
Anyways I don't particularly care myself. I tend not to buy things from companies that flip me the bird. :p
Poor sad Luna :(
so...the company is wrong for making it so you have to buy a game new to access some of the content, but a store is perfectly right for buying a used game for a small amount and reselling it at a high amount and keeping all of the profits? the company is getting royally screwed
08,01Dashie_Dashie: we need more Zeus Beefslam
11,01They still are consumer-right gang rapers.
Hwi
11,01Not my problem.
Perhaps everyone else can whine about it, but that's their problem because they're the ones who keep buying it.
11,01Publisher should take that up with the company.
11,01Maybe add bonuses to the new product.
Nittany_Discord: NOT SAFE FOR WOONAA
00,03Hey all!
I stop buying from dudes who are trying to break into my wallet and steal from it.
The company is entirely within their right to sell second-hand. Just like there are entire car companies dealing with second-hand cars and such.
the ONLY reason those companies loose money in ANY way would be that they made a shitty game
heyo Scoot-Scootaloo
11,01Instead of cutting content and holding it ransom.
00,03My mechanical Dog died :'(
hey Scoot-Scootaloo ~
which is their own fault then
GOOD NIGHT EVERYBODY
so, screw the companies that make the game and spend millions of dollars making top notch games but give money to the stores who contribue absolutely nothing to the game and make a ton of money off used sales
YES
Move it down
08,01Jim Hunkleg
piracy doesn't hurt artists or software giants
11,01I guess.
Now up
Ingwaz: Yup.
00,03He died helping me kill Legate Lanius :(
You know what I do if I dont liek or agree with something? I dont support it. You stop playing video games and show them big bad meanies whos boss! Meanwhile, I have Mass effect 3 and SSX to look forward to
08,01Thud Stompmouth
Move it up now
nor does re-selling
11,01Just like publishers make money off of the hard work of developers.
not the mech dog!
Up more
Now, that I agree with. Gamestop can burn.
A little more
If people want to keep selling to them, then by all means they deserve to make money.
08,01Bark Redflail
Piracy has been linked to helping because people try the content the decide to support it unless you suck
nvm
dat twilight based browser
11,01And fuck with free-market capitalism.
oh look, gmod
aw that one
11,01Both ends are crooked.
that'S a nice vid
lol
guys
GO INTO THE OTHER ROOM
Nittany_Discord: indeed they are, both sides are wrong, but many people are blaming the game company alone
The whole Piracy thing is very grey on this, so either way both sides loose
Allright the talk is about games, goodnight Everypony!
the text walls are getting a little ridiculous!
nigth Smash_Lampjaw
The whole Super-PAC thing means only republicans and corporate democrats can get elected.
11,01Well, game companies aren't giving gamers reasons to like them.
DAH!
GUYS! other room!
Dat heavy
00,03I never really liked gamestop. they keep asking me for game insurance.
00,03What the eff is game insurance?
dat sandvich
lol Scoot-Scootaloo i bought game insurance a few times...never again
What is it
it's insurance to keep paying for their wallets
CAKE IS A LIE
But it's not a matter of right vs wrong, it's a matter of "are you really dumb enough to keep selling your games to them knowing they'll make absurd profit off of you?". And if the answer is yes, then nothing can stop them and nothing can save you. :p
game insurance is only good if you live with a bunch of toddlers
Game insurance is nice if you have a tendency to pick up your xbox and make it scratch the DVDS
Oh on newer games discs are becoming more fragile 0.o
or scratch them yourself
04NS
04WAIT
04BRING ID
Scoot-Scootaloo: basically if the game stops working bc it gets scratched/damaged over normal course of use you can get a new copy to replace it
like ubisoft's drm. limiting the reinstallation count of a game AND THEN programming it so crappy that something as simple as the change of a graphics card COUNTS AS ONE OF THOSE THREE REINSTALLATIONS???
11,01Back a half-decade ago, all you had to do to play a game was buy it and register it. You go the whole game.
Dat happy trail
the fuck ubisoft? the fuck?
Break Window Repair Window Break Window
adn back though the SAME WINDOW
00,03Sounds like its for Irresponsible 12 year olds
dude, I love Ubisoft. they're european
who needs that anyway? it's not like you would be using your game as a frisbee
Diglet
11,01No limited installs, Steam/Origin, Ubi DRM, online passes, DLC, or other bullshit.
When DRM makes it harder for someone that actually buys the game compared to someone who pirated it. Something has gone wrong.
Scoot: So my brother
11,01Well, Steam was around 5 years ago.
i just think its ridiculous to be okay with, as you admit, a store doing something thats wrong, because hey, theyre making money. but a company that produces a product to use methods to encourage you to buy their product so they get the profits is completely wrong and should burn
00,03Maybe...
anno ahs them
Ingwaz: No, not encourage.
You mistaken their intentions.
for anno 2070 it's three installations only. after that you're fucked
They are not trying to "encourage you" to buy from them, they are trying to FORCE YOU to buy from them.
11,01Online passes are not encouragments.
Like Black Ops, i purchased it with a few friends, we came home and wanted to play right away, but nope. We had to register through steam and download the entire game from stea. So the DVD was empty except for a manual+ key.
how so? with things like ME2, if you didnt buy it new, all you lost out on was some dlc, nothging special
11,01They're punishments.
get present, play with the box
good times
imagine you have hardware troubles or gotta reset your system. one day you suddenly can't play aqnymore. maybe you made an upgrade once?
00,03Don't even get me startted on online passes..
then your money and the game is gone
11,01Oh, I forgot.
00,03I can't play BF3 multiplayer even though I own a copy :(
FOOTBALL
otakon: the dlc was not hugely game changing, you still had the product you paid for
Why Scoot-Scootaloo?
Ingwaz: Arrival is important to ME3
POW POW POW NIET
08,01Wrek: let's watch some Red Dwarf
11,015 years ago, a publisher couldn't lock you out of your damn game for any reason.
scoot that seems to be a far spread problem
otakon: not required, me3 will explain it all if you didnt do it
00,03Someone used the code to play online!
05i settign up stuff
05its only to pass time
k, I don't think anyone knows what they are talking about in the main.
08,01noice
I LOVE THAT SONG!
00,03i was SOO mad
the engineering behind bf3 is an insult to the gaming community
GUYS! TAKE THIS CONVO TO REGULARS PLEASE!!!!
Don't yo hate it when that happens to tyou?
11,01Publishers are an insult now.
don't really feel like talking about dmr and online passes ~
what are you talking about?
lol
oh, nvm
i just dont get how its okay for a store to rip you off, but not okay for a company to do the same to preserve their profits
i myself can play, but the internet browser based server platform is buggy as gell
*hell
the least they could do is take it to the PMs
Ingwaz: Didn't say that, read again
What make me mad is that people have been banned from their entire origin/steam accounts and locked out of all their games, jsut because something they did in another game.
11,01Holding part of a game hostage to preserve profits is not ok.
11,01NEVER.
guys
we're in an age where anyone will do anything for $
well, its either that, or they make no profit
04NS damnit
REGULAR ROOM TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION PLEASE!!!!!!
04answer
However on the other end without Publishers we wont have the games that we have today, hate it or not we need Publishers even though I dont like it
/me facepalms
11,01otakon's right.
ohai Pegasister16
Nittany_Discord: thank you
00,03Tres bien
Hey!
I'm okay with a company ripping people off if they're seriously dumb enough to keep making the same mistake over and over again. I'm not okay with a company screwing ALL of their customers for the sake of annoying a few of them.
11,01We don't need publishers.
hiya Pegasister16!
Shhh, SOLDIER! is asleep
lol
HAha epic sax guy
fine, I will go to the regular room ....if I can remember :P
epic sac heavy is best epic sax guy
So this is what i return to O>O
lol
o-o
lol
i think the discussion is pretty much over regardless as its pretty obvious neither group intends to yield to the other group, and i have things i need to do
if you disagree with it, boycott it and dont buy it at all, thats all i've got to say on it
11,01Pretty much.
What?
Exactly. :
11,01I've boycotted pretty much any AAA publisher.
turtles!
*:P
11,01So, already done.
I like tuh'tles
Digimon
we could all grab a stick and fight to the death in a ring at the next bronycon
Nittany_Discord: yes you have, have fun not having a hobby anymore
stuff is still coming out of that box?
bets can be placed
Don't like, don't give them your money. I don't give money to people for things I don't like, simple as that.
11,01otakon: Indie gaming.
00,03Will derpy get her voice fixed?
Indie gaming ftw
Nittany_Discord: is still sparse and underpopulated
00,03Will bronies be content?
Indie gaming is very good.
11,01I don't care.
00,03Toon in next time on Dragon Ball Z!
dem Gmod
Scoot-Scootaloo: depends on what you mean by fixed, hasbro already "fixed" it
lol
the world may never know Scoot-Scootaloo
11,01I don't feel bad about supporting an indie developer.
oh, nvm
dat DR2
Lol
I wouldn't say indie-market is sparse and underpopulated.
I know this reference
Snuffsis: it is on consoles that's for sure
Drake: She's gone
Well except for some games. I'll still emerge from my shell of hipster-ness to play games like GW2 because ArenaNet are good developers and I'd happily throw money at them for extended periods of time whenever they asked me to.
00,03:D
um WHA?!
04I realised
I just don't know what went so wrong
GW2?
wut
I like the indie market, it's when they do nothing but pixels games is kinda lame
suddenly hlemets
11,01Indie market's growing especially on PC.
11,01Valve is helping out.
Guild Wars 2
only 43 kills in BTB halo
where is that store ! i want a point and shoot hat !
Good thing it was not me.
otakon: OH yea, compared to PC Definitely, but it is growing on consoles aswell.
11,01And kickstarter.
ahh of course
but I don't mind the pixels,
00,03Have you guys ever wondered about the future of gaming?
Snuffsis: true but not fast enough
yes
Yes i wondered
Valve has great support for indie developers with Steam.
11,01I don't really care anymore.
He hasa cart for that?
00,03We have all these games that look so lifelike and stuff, where else is there to g?
i'll definately try GW2. it looks promising
Scoot: I used to wonder about the future of gaming but then I took an arrow to the knee.
/me ducks
spy!
I was gonna talk about how the Wii U will support indie titles, but I don't have any sourses.
Scoot-Scootaloo: eventually it will become all Digital Disturbution at an even higher price
00,03CriticKitten: -_-
Scoot-Scootaloo: physical controls, rather than controllers
I used to make arrow to the knee jokes
11,01The future is indie gaming on the PC and digital distribution.
I dont know, who knows what would happen to games during this generation
Then i took a mace to the face
big red music button... i want one
Digital Distribution being more expensive is fucking ridiculous.
the future of gaming is pixel art
she is dead
11,01Or cloud gaming since publishers will have full control over their products.
Snuffsis: it is, but that's how it's going
lol
00,03Oh and it seems that EVERY new game that comes out is a shooter, or some combat oriented genre
Just as a fad
murdering is in
11,01Only the ones that get press.
Snuffsis: mfw GotY Fallout 3 is 40 on Steam but only 20 for a physical copy at Wal Mart
And not a single fuck was given that day.
There will be new types of games coming out with the Wii U
Dark_Horst: Aye. I think if it came out as it is right now, it'd be the best game of this year.
To be honest, I am tired of shooters, unless it does something new and interesting to it then I would be interested in a shooter
The derpy sitution solved
Nintendos comeback as a non-family oriented gaming company
Ninja Gaiden 3
All i gotta say
I would add to the discussion, but this debate is getting a bit tiresome now
oh god
See?
otakon: hope that in the futureu it will change. Since today it's only more expensive due to, if you believe TB, pressure from retail stores.

all this discussion is boring me now, I'm otta here, bye everyone
in a way
the reason so many games today go for bloody murder is that singleplayer gaming slowly goes instinct. it's all multiplayer on global contest. and that will keep getting bigger. and what's the best way of two teams to contest each other? stabbing, slicing, cutting, hacking, beating, shooting and blowing up each other

08,01Snuffsis: why is he a dick, though? is it not a legitimate cause to buy them? or are any of the others' motivations more legitimate?
not a dick move though
but still is a business move
I sure wish I had 5 bucks...

... every "yoink" take a drink
okay, so the rules are every reload, headshot and "oh fuck" ?
brb guys biobreak
its an action rpg but its still an rpg so looting is #1 concern

Wrek: USE YOUR RADAR!
1,3we're gonna add "yoink" too

Ohai LadyCanary ^_^
i made that level with a taser and a pistol
...that's actually a lot easier
its a trappppppp
people don't shoot you that often
1,3the game is more entertaining on a non-lethal sneak run
and that's why you TAKE THE TOXIC FILTER FOR YOUR LUNGS!
kirzstryfe agreed, and easier usually
cept the bosses
this makes me want to reinstall that game
well Wrek has thrown that out of the window
kirzstryfe: agreed trying to do non lethal is more fun
00,03Dat quickscoping
^^
1,3if you're never spotted, never kill, and hack everything, you can get almost every upgrade
00,03dat no scoping

I'm to young
to drink
Ahhhh, Dues ex.
just holding that amount of liquid will be hard
whisky here så cheers
Play TF2

Nevermind
