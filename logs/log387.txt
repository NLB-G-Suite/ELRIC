Gah! You're right. What's wrong with me? ><
Eurostream in 50 minutes :3
okay? but did that justify saying "shut the fuck up" to them?
looks like I missed some drama
05,15CountDoofus become Kirby
Besides, until the creator says otherwise, you aren't really allowed to criticise their creative works.
yes they can its their stream
Yeah, but meh, I lash out too when people critic my drawing (mainly becuz they arent worth garbage)
o.o
Or atleast I think it works that way
and then we lose one of the best streamers
%Fluttercry is right. Let it go.
....bronie's are kinda edgy today, it seems
Inb4 some ponies get Da Boot for continuing the convo :D
05,15No no no one's getting the boot. I'm just asking everyone to let this go.
Oh, ok :3
^
Would probably be a good idea for someone to take the reigns of the stream to take viewer's minds off of the topic
:3
I.E. play a vid or something
well then, everybody aqueeze a beanbag or something
Val hates Trixie, he is automatically absolved of all wrongdoing.
this convo... again...
Val hates Trixie? :(
already pretty sick of the argument, unless it goes down on hubworld or somewhere more official than itunes
Anyone with a working brain hates Trixie.
I<3 ponies
%fluttercry I DO
its just apple covering their asses
I say Trixie should be run over with a steamroller.
luna best pony!
^
I myself was offended that he lashed out like that because someone complained about he's drawing
*B)
good old viewers, attentions spans of a goldfish lol
I lik Twilight and Pinkie
05,15Bluestrom_S Seriously let it go
Mods here are mods for their tech skills and refreshing personality. not some moral code.
Engage the dialogue and work for an answer.
somehow i'm getting the feeling that certain events suudenly have us all twitching in our seats today
yes, the derpy issue has us all finiky
or most of us
^
Now I have to rewind. I was watching Archer
^
Its tearing us apart! :(

Pinkie Pie is best pony.

Why can't we all just get along?!

I don't even know summertime anymore.

It's hot and there are bugs everywhere.

I like winter.
i don't like summer that much. against the cold, you can tank up
We need Fighting Is Magic, Now! :D
but heat? completely at mercy
Lol :D
Maybe they noticed it but didn't say anything
Any idea when Fighting is Magic and Ponykart are actually coming out? lol
Perhaps.

Oh.
05,15I still need to check my McDonalds
It's like that.
http://i.imgur.com/925X7.gif
Dude.
Here we go again XD
I used to do a pricecheck on some of the most embarassing items when I worked in a store
I can see infinite.
the horrible thing is: the pony merge over here is a fucking trainwreck
I think the McDonald's toys don't start until March
enjoy
http://i.imgur.com/UooHK.jpg
*merch
11,01I'm back.
is there no stream atm?
Yeah, they're not selling ponies over here.
McDonalds still has the old Star Wars toys. Just came from there.
AW MY EYES
http://www.bronyfunds.com/?page_id=13 Anyone?
Let me rephrase.
We should all change our voice in protest. I'm talking like Bullwinkle until this is reversed.
At McDonald's? Yes, they are coming in March
:/
i personaly dont think that they should replace derpy's voice but is it really that bad?
yes i just did
11,01XD
All the time.
It'd be like her normal voice.
agreed. the voice is nice. eyes not. namecensor not
i loved her voice
Heya Everypony :)
especially when she said ARe you okay R
11,01That would be possessed Derpy.
especially when she said ARe you okay RAinbobw dash? anything i can do to help?
wow type fail
Should've left her name intact.
/me loves how she cheerfully and disingenuously says "My Bad" now.
05,15We should take Hasbro...and BURN IT DOWN
Yep.
11,01Don't spread blame yet.
presumably their inbox was full...
05,15ouch
05,15I never get to start a riot :(
Derpy....male...?
but that'S not the reason for cutting the name and fiddling with the eyes
http://escism.net/omfgdogs/
Oh right, it was Tabitha.
11,01I'm sure a lot of it is hate mail sadly.
Nittany - most of it was automated mail send via the petitions
I don't see anything on the screen, is the stream currently down or am I lagging?
05,15WTF did I just see
sent*
you! ameribronies! stalk thiessen!

Ameribronies? I like that

/me shudders when he hears "Love and Tolerate"
Looking at some graphic equalizers for my laptop. I like the look of Realtime equalizer, does anyone know of another program out there?
I -think- I can find it again.
She'll be fine...? As in...?
it's an airy definition
Yes!
deeeeerp
Derpy's*
i'm still kinda scared. because now it looks like a few screamers without reason have won. and i'm afraid that might happen again
tasting blood and all
Oh, the naming situations?
NO
just
NO
Mmm We can only hope :)
The thing that really concerns me about the whole Derpy thing is that they are going to be less likely to give out fanservice like that in the future, and likely start focussing more on the target demographic
Hope is an immensely flimsy thing.
I like my current derpy
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2CRjPO73Dg if you missed it
It was already confirmed that derpy would never speak again.
Was it?
it's also unlikely that she'll speak again
whos streamning?
Derpy is best secondary
05,15Sky_Pirate_Brony I'm pretty sure we don't make up that much of the commuinty
It's not like they'd stick a sign on the start of each episode "You're weird if you're watching this and over 14 years old"
I don't know many that do?
Is it just me, or is there nothing on the stream and it's just buffering?
nothings on
Nothing is streaming.
not yet anyway
no livestream
Be prepared for nothing to happen then.
you want that?
woot! stream

If the customer wants to sell it to Gamestop for 5 dollars of store credit, and Gamestop then resells for 50 bucks, that's their choice in both cases. The publisher has no say in that, and if they want to curb it, maybe they shouldn't overprice their games in the first place.

11,01They still are consumer-right gang rapers.
Hwi
11,01Not my problem.
11,01Publisher should take that up with the company.
00,03Hey all!
11,01Instead of cutting content and holding it ransom.
which is their own fault then
GOOD NIGHT EVERYBODY
YES
Move it down
08,01Jim Hunkleg
piracy doesn't hurt artists or software giants
11,01I guess.
Now up
00,03He died helping me kill Legate Lanius :(
08,01Thud Stompmouth
Move it up now
http://th00.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2012/021/c/a/tears_of_a_princess_by_tinuleaf-d4n723z.png
nor does re-selling
11,01Just like publishers make money off of the hard work of developers.
Up more
Now, that I agree with. Gamestop can burn.
A little more
If people want to keep selling to them, then by all means they deserve to make money.
08,01Bark Redflail
Piracy has been linked to helping because people try the content the decide to support it unless you suck
nvm
dat twilight based browser
11,01And fuck with free-market capitalism.
oh look, gmod
aw that one
11,01Both ends are crooked.
that'S a nice vid
lol
guys
GO INTO THE OTHER ROOM
Allright the talk is about games, goodnight Everypony!
the text walls are getting a little ridiculous!
http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/346/6/2/comic_luna_by_ellispony-d4ix5s1.png
It's not Gamestop's fault that people are gullible enough to sell their games to GS for a pittance. That's the fault of stupid people. GS deserves to make money off of the stupid even if it's not moral. :p
The whole Super-PAC thing means only republicans and corporate democrats can get elected.
DAH!
GUYS! other room!
whoops I changed the subject.
it's insurance to keep paying for their wallets
Oh on newer games discs are becoming more fragile 0.o

They are not trying to "encourage you" to buy from them, they are trying to FORCE YOU to buy from them.
11,01Online passes are not encouragments.
11,01They're punishments.

Don't yo hate it when that happens to tyou?
11,01Publishers are an insult now.
don't really feel like talking about dmr and online passes ~
lol
oh, nvm
i just dont get how its okay for a store to rip you off, but not okay for a company to do the same to preserve their profits
*hell
the least they could do is take it to the PMs
11,01NEVER.
guys
04NS damnit
REGULAR ROOM TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION PLEASE!!!!!!
04answer
However on the other end without Publishers we wont have the games that we have today, hate it or not we need Publishers even though I dont like it
/me facepalms
11,01otakon's right.
00,03Tres bien
Hey!
I'm okay with a company ripping people off if they're seriously dumb enough to keep making the same mistake over and over again. I'm not okay with a company screwing ALL of their customers for the sake of annoying a few of them.
11,01We don't need publishers.
Shhh, SOLDIER! is asleep
lol
lol
lol
if you disagree with it, boycott it and dont buy it at all, thats all i've got to say on it
11,01Pretty much.
Exactly. :
11,01I've boycotted pretty much any AAA publisher.

*:P
11,01So, already done.

11,01I don't care.

lol
11,01I don't feel bad about supporting an indie developer.
oh, nvm
dat DR2
Lol
I wouldn't say indie-market is sparse and underpopulated.
I know this reference
Well except for some games. I'll still emerge from my shell of hipster-ness to play games like GW2 because ArenaNet are good developers and I'd happily throw money at them for extended periods of time whenever they asked me to.
00,03:D
um WHA?!
04I realised
GW2?
wut

Yes i wondered
11,01I don't really care anymore.
