he nearky died

10No, the lifeguards gave me this heat pack and told me to keep it on for 30 minutes to ooze the pain

Somehow I've never been stung by a jellyfish - even though I see them pretty often in the sea.
Anyone here been stung by a jellyfish?
10Me LOL
Hahaha, you're a magnet for stining creatures.
10This jellyfish was just floating around when I was swimming in the deeper end of the ocean
6Pretty sure.
10It wrapped its legs around my arm
I was at the beach once and there was someone scooping up jellyfish and putting them in a makeshift lagoon someone made
and there was children all over looking at them
Yeah, I've seen a couple of people catch them for whatever reason.
I did once have the bad luck of walking on some fish hook someone left in on the beach though.
lol

i got it to only say it once
after 4 seconds

10[15:33] <Jerry> just wondering, did anyone go for the E3 conference? <- No, but I heard about the Wii U announcement
6And no, Roboshi, Celestia is not the lord. Celestia is an evil being that should be dethrowned. And taking that seat... you just left. >>;
Same here
I watched the E3 on the DVR :P

6Good evening.
about the PSPVita=me goes o.o
It was probably just cheaper for them not to provide it (like after a year no PS3s were at all backwards compatible).

%bffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
10"^ lol, I watched that show once. Never again. :P" <- Meaning you saw one episode or the entire thing?
Just one or two episodes.
An acid trip.
10Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt (PSG)
O_o
o.o
Oh, that
I loved that show/anime, even though everyone else should hate it :P
(Do not watch, if you like sanity .v.)
take a wild guess when they watch this
You are right :P
/me hide
You liked it
You told me :P
!admincommands
10No
WHY
someone else
try
10I laughed at a few things
and see if it notices you.
10Never said I liked it
!admincommands
We'll see about that after season 2
That show was more just disturbing than anything.
Wat
10Just weirdest anime ever
It's like an acid trip.
in the bot's status window:
USER Not enough parameters
USER Not enough parameters
USER Not enough parameters
Which makes it good :D
10Puella Magi > PSG
10:3
wat
8sprinkles, i didnt know you were a getter
But with subtitles.
Since I dislike regular anime
6Yes.
I dunno.
Nothing wrong with the script.
6I'm top 3 currently.
It works fine for me.
6Though the top 5 is INCREDIBLY close.
/me RUNS
10Speaking of that, it's amazing that I've kept the same forum theme for over a month
8nice
13I still need to watch PSG sometime
10I usually change every week or every 2 weeks
lightlugia: I suppose we'll agree to disagree then.
8i dont get, but i have gotten dubs, trips, quads and quints before
/me SHOT
6I have the magical inability to GET quints.
I've kept the same theme for ______ months.
:D
!admincommands
10It does get boring
6They would skyrocket me to the top of the list, just can't GET them.
/me didnt change it for a year_
8i got them accidentally one day
'cause I'm boring like that.
A couple of episodes are boring at times :P
year+
ergh
i'm gonna ask i #mIRC
But the others are odd
in*
10Especially episode... 7? With the Transformers reference
8yesterday, i got devils trips TWICE
That wasn't boring at all XD
/me checks
Now episode 8/9 I think
Fun
6I saw that.
8i was a little worried
13How many episodes are there?
6My first post on ponychan was actually a 777.
Twelve I think.
13ish
1013
10with an OVA
Including a 10min episode thingy
Good luck, Angel.
I finished in January XD
10The one thing that's good about PSG is...
10the soundtrack
Or something close...
Yes, the music
And the suggestiveness too :P
Nah.
Soundtrack only.
8nice
8my 1st was a dubs
10And the best song is the angel's transformation theme
I tend not to like anime anyway.
8 1st as a tripfriend i should say
10Espy, I think it's too much similar to PPG XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASOHCJ9FO-E&feature=related
;o
10Or PPG Z rather
6I didn't have trip at the time.
Timing
6Well, not before posting not-anon...
6If that makes any sense.
/me approves of HML's link
"You are NOT the father" *plays that theme*
06=o!
Draw Stocking
/me hides
8after a few weeks, i realized that it was not at all similar to 4chan
06Or rather no
I once beat a snake in a staring contest.
o.o seriously?
6I used to lurk 4chan. Never posted though.
ya.
it was tough
but I prevailed in the end.
snakes are skilled and clever foes.
How? Don't they have no eyelids?
Very carefully.
(I don't know much about snakes)
8lol
Get two pens and use them as chopsticks.
lol
...lol
I did that once at school.
Problem is
8me too
6Same.
Screw it, I'm using fingers
Maybe stop gnawing on trees?
6DCD needs to be done getting dragged on errands now.
02Fingers ftw?
8lol
Back.
Hey.
4Are you going to be around for the BMN tonight?
Maybe, I doubt I can make the whole of it though.
Because it ends at something like 2 AM without the aftershow for me, and I have a fair ammount of work to do.
6I I I I DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T
6That was well timed, too. XD

2COOKIES NAO
4Until AFTER I posted
but...
Yeah, that's unlucky.
but...
4And then it hit me like a ton of bricks when I realized that if he says *one thing* to me, the entirety of Ponychan would rush to his aid and swarm me with bullshit
4That's the kind of intolerance I'm talking about on Ponychan
2NUH UH D:<

8IMMEDIATE SHITSTORM
4Huh, I remember that thread. I lurked but I didn't read much
4Where was the thread at, Hip?
4@dari: Bags supposedly said "who cares if the rest of the world thinks we're all pedophiles?" yesterday
/me bites Black_Latios's neck "MINE!"
/me crys
I guess I can give you one

HAH! MINE!
/me 2tackles lightlugia and uses Ice Beam
4I hope you're right
/me falls over but isn't affected by icebeam

http://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh235/thelugia/100_1330.jpg
8also, remember how i said i was convinced the soldier was inside my head and was translating my thoughts into eloquent posts?
8he just did it again
4Where?
He said something I don't at all agree with.
Wut
/me stuffs it in Black_Latios's beak
2O-o
/me throws masterball at it!
8ghosties, in that thread i made
4Ah, yeah, I just saw his post
4Oh, did some shameless plugging for a "what are you doing?" thread on /oat/ :D
mfw I began learning english at ~10 yo
I like you guys
/me takes his and stuffs in in Black_Latios's beak :#
Other than if you had reached the point at 13 where you couldn't be bothered to learn it.
4I barely remember any Spanish at all : /
8i took spanish every year starting in 6th grade
8still not particularly good at it
8hell, my roommate is majoring in spanish, has been taking it for 3 years at an advanced university level and lived in spain for a few months, and he still isnt fluent
He didn't put much effort into it and wasn't very good.
When he was older he paid for lessons, and is fluent.
mfw I used the wrong name.
Age has nothing to do with it.
At a younger age than most school starts.
13Hows it goin everypony
4Alright, I suppose
2bbl
8dari, studies have shown that young children learn languages more easily than older people
I've seen studies that suggest the opposite.
hows it going everyone?
13When does the uh
I'm kinda surprised that quit message is still getting used. lol
13Er. Nvm.
4Nah, I'm just fucking with ya
D: Y U NO LIKE ME D:
oh lol
4I hate everybody
4*shrugs*

Mrs. Orly, really now - lol
for me its a debate between fluttershy and rainbow dash
PINKE PIE!!
Everypony knows Applejack is best pony
Orly Tates
@Pungrongo Dash, Fluttershy, Dash, Fluttershy DEAE LORD I SUCK WITH DECISCIONS
Rainbow dash/fluttershy are best. no questioning it.
Furthermore, if we were doing a pre-show, would people still have to post their suggestions in the discussion thread on /chat/?
Eyup.
Women watching My Little Pony? Preposterous! Ponies are for the manliest of manly men type men! Women watch girly gunk like wrestling and football.
Shocking!
Fluttershy, Raindbow Dash, Applejack, in that order
OH REALLY, MS. ORLY?!
Oh really, Mrs. Orly?? XD
Flutteryshy/Applejack
I don't really like applejack
yeah, but we arent tonight
is just
wow
damn, the stream keeps cutting out on me
Pinkamena (crazy Pinkie), Trixie, and Twilight in that order
pinkie pie is my 3rd favourite ^_^
DashiePie
DAT LIFEBAR
I have Fluttershy and Rarity tied as my favorite ponies
obviousley apple jack
Cool
Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Applejack, Twilight, Pinkie, Rarity.
Neihter have I
Derpy is the best pony
I just hope it won't be pushing our luck
THERE IS NO LOCKET ON HIM
There's no locket!
Rainbow Dash is best pony.
Luna haters
DUN DUN DUNNN
Fluttershy
I honestly can't decide. I like them all.
inorite
Luna is best royalty
Anyone had a pony dream yet?
You know you're correct when the music stops.
Not yet
Trixie is best Trixie
The butler did it
I did
I have
It's like watching cartoon law and order
Dreams?
they are slowly invading my mind :/
0Rarity, Fluttershy, Twilight, Pinkie, Rainbow, Applejack.
combustablelemons, I have
I've had dreams about everything but ponies
its fluttershy,rainbow dash,twilight sparkle,pinkie pie
dat face
I wish
:'(
my friend had one though
DON'T CROSS CELESTIA, OR YOU'LL BE GIVEN A ONE WAY TICKET TO THE MOON
I had my first Animal Crossing dream in like a decade.
it was fun
I did. T'was pretty awesome
But the moon is in...
And you'll be in SPPPPAAAAAACCCE
pinkie pie was kind of trying to kill me, but applejack convinced her not to
heya
I had one where Rainbow Dash took over the world
:?
I had a GTA IV dream the other night
I haven't remembered a dream in years.
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
That would have been fun, had ponies gotten involved
dont be too hasty :D
4I dreamed Fluttershy was playing the Wii last night
Wii U Mad?
i want a pony dream ;_;
4Skyrim
lol wii u
4of all games : /
Skyrim on wii?
I had to go on a trip, and Rarity offered to make me a suit
O__o
On the Wii?
Oh, it's this case.
This fandom is severely lacking in Apple Pie shipping, clearly Apple Pie is the superior ship as apple pies are tasty.
wii suuuucks
4Yeah, haha
wii uuu wii uuu
I had a dream of "Cupckakes"
i forgot about that
4It is a DREAM after all, right
4?
I had a dream that I was rainbow dash
I had another dream that was strangely like a full episode
Mmmm apple pies
Skyrim on Wii U would be epic
Rainbow Dash breaks her leg after failing to do a trick
4There's no way Skyrim would ever be ported over to the Wii
Unfortunately, they only ever happen on weekdays
Wii U. Now I play videogames while I play videogames.
4...maybe the Wii U
when I had mine I automatically went and posted it on PonyChan before I could forget it
6Is this girl like, 5?
Alright
