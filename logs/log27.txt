6I plan on it.
6Maybe.
6Hmm... I step away a few minutes to get coffee and somepony new enters the chat.
6...and now he's gone. *shrug*
armagedon
you there? :s
yeah
I made a really simple speech script for my bot
on text
to reply when someone says hi to it
It should work
but
it's not
i probably made some nubby mistake when i made the script
but could you look at it? lol
o-o
on *:TEXT:*hi*:#: { msg $chan reply here }
@ luna
I didnt want to have to do a new on text
for each optional reply
so i did this
!espeon !isukra
!isukra
:(
I put a picture of Nightmare Moon as my iPhone wallpaper
And took it out today
Oo
o.o
o-o
I don't even now
Also
06Would probably be smart to only make it reply if one actually says hi to the bot and not if anyone says hi :P
No Pokémon BW merch in Singapore still
Also no ponies
/me hides
Accidental quit
;p
yeah that's what luna actually did
Ew iPhone and ponies
Worst mix
Whut

What do you need?
You all with your fancy consecutives.
well
I gotta show you all who's really on top
Your bot can't be worse than mine :o
I bet it is
mine locked me out of it's standard commands
.... lol
WELL MY BOT IS JUST FINE.
One moment.
and it also
doesnt know how to fucking say anything
other than greetings
>_>
hi lunaron
Greetings :)
that's all it can do atm
lol
ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
it has a ban protection script
Y U ASPLODE START MENU
but when it rejoins it doesnt say anything :<
YOU'RE BLOCKING HALF THE FUCKING SCREEN
and lol majin
i see fgvhdeidfrhjcewjf majin
what do you want
have plenty of spaces
lmao
i see blank.
hi hi hiHIH HIH IHIH I HI MAJIN
fuck you
lmao
Once I win the four way, King will be easy pickings (NOT due to his condition, but the fact that I always beat him)
Ololololol.
majin is a derp
majin has daddy issues
alright this is pissing me off
brb nuking wmv
/me runs circles around majin
weeee
oh
now it closes
6I've got 39 points, puts me 1 below Circuit and King (not counting King's imagederp)
as i fucking hit ctrl alt del
it fucking closes.
6I still have to get quints, XD
my ctrl alt del
doesnt work
on winblows
.notice luna msg # is just by itself. What are you supposed to send to the channel?
SUCKS TO BE YOU.
lol
...
... lol
Stupid . key.
...lol
derp
;.;
it's supposed to say
what it says
luna
It doesn't say anything.
i give you a task
on the 5th line i think
{ .cs unban # | .timer 5 1 join # | msg # }
make script so each time i speak, a 3 is randomly placed in my words
That's yours script, the rest isn't included.
don't question it
You opened one bracket, closed it at the end there, and all the rest is outisde the on KICK.
outside*
need to have { { at front
herp
ohai Skylands
No you don't, you just don't need to close the bracket at the end of that bit at the start.
yeah
i noticed that
lol
oh
Exactly. I still think this consecutive thing is just some new extravegance that you guys are using for point fishing
i don't know msl stop yelling at me
{ .cs unban # | .timer 5 1 join # | msg # }
Message the channel what?
6I already was rank 3 without it.
msg # Derp.
6Tied for it, but rank 3 none the less.
10Heya
msg # $ip
>_>
msg # penis
6With it I'm ahead. XD
msg # $penis
/me adds $penis to alias list.
lol
sp
so*
it needs a timer still
because it's messaging too fast
what timer, .timer 1 1
or at
wat*
derp.
...
O_o
it messages
right before it joins
because of the join timer being 1 1
I see dat GET thread.
.timer 11 join #
1 1*
so i need a slower timer for the msg
Add a timer to the msg # part?
^
ya
but
i heard what happend, how are you now?
what ammount
lol
10 1
Lawl.
Do 0.1 0
10Huh?
Don't do that.
:P
it still
messages
too quickly
So make
the timer
wait
for longer
Also
why
you talk
like this?
idk
you were stung? or am i still not better? X.x
6lulz and then you get consecutives.
10Oh, I'm fine
6Now who's farming for phish?
10It only hurt for an hour
Don't I have to at this point?
6Pretty much.
good
I'm tied for fifth now
but I have a plan
6You need to get a better palindrome.
That too
6My palindrome is worth the most. XD 6 points because only 2 numbers.

Because it's an on KICK
No idea. Maybe you activated the trigger in here?
And you got kicked.
I got kicked
And it activates in any channel, and is not specific to username.
now the bot
not*
It doesn't need to be the bot.
on KICK activates whenever anyone gets kicked.

10On my vacation trip, I was stung by a sting ray
ich
not good
06Oh :<
lulz
So who's hosting today? DCD again?
10Yeah, this one was pretty small though
You have to be pretty unlucky to get stung in the head by one though.
You know, my dad told me that one of my uncles was stung by a sting ray too
he nearky died
*nearly
10Depends on the size
10This one was no bigger than a small bowl
hmmm
you still want to be careful
Seen a doctor?
10No, the lifeguards gave me this heat pack and told me to keep it on for 30 minutes to ooze the pain
Ah OK
if you feel funny though, get a doctor really fast
10And they also noted, "If you haven't had your shots in the last 10 years, you should consider getting them"
10Which I have, in fact last back in April, so I'm good
06That's good.
Somehow I've never been stung by a jellyfish - even though I see them pretty often in the sea.
Anyone here been stung by a jellyfish?
10Me LOL
/me gets bad luck
Hahaha, you're a magnet for stining creatures.
10This jellyfish was just floating around when I was swimming in the deeper end of the ocean
6Uh... I think it's Redfield. DCD has something to do.
6Pretty sure.
10It wrapped its legs around my arm
I was at the beach once and there was someone scooping up jellyfish and putting them in a makeshift lagoon someone made
and there was children all over looking at them
Yeah, I've seen a couple of people catch them for whatever reason.
I did once have the bad luck of walking on some fish hook someone left in on the beach though.
10As if that scarred me enough to avoid the ocean, this sting ray was right by the shore line
So no Kamen Riders Rape? Glory glory glory
lol
hm
i got it to only say it once
and I ewas telling everyone, don't touch them and don't get your feet in the water
after 4 seconds
but
or the jellyfish will sting you
it's still doing it for anyone who gets kicked
*was
You probably didn't put everying inside the if statement.
Skylands › It wrapped its legs around my arm <- you mean its tentacles
10Whatever
6You never know.
10Exotic creatures like me, I've never been stung by something more common such as bees/wasps
6He is a friend of DCD's.
Blarg
try #spam or something
heh
I don't get why people who aren't alergic are so afraid of bees and wasps.
I won't be here for the movies, but I always enjoy the preshow
for wat
the most I have here are mosquitoes
and I never got dengue fever
I guess I'm lucky
That reminds me, they had some freaky super mosquitoes in France.
Dengue fever is a real problem in Singapore
Bigger then the ones I see here and they were sort of red.
your Lunaron bot
than*
The government freaking out and making 10000000% sure they don't breed
Mutant mosquitoes
6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130771543534.jpg !!Rarity is amazing.
I guess

Damn things didn't even wait until night, there were just swarms of them on a trail outide.
oh, im testing it in a different channel already
SKYLANDS
:D
I think
06:3
I'm getting obsessed with Nightmare Moon
Pony time? Pony time.
NIGHTMARE MOOOOOOOOOON
To much pony time
NEVER ENOUGH! :P
There is always enough :P
its a kiddie show for god sakes
Too much of pretty much anything can kill you. Only if so much pony that you die is it too much.
I don't even.
Her, !!Pinkiepie, and !!Spike are my favorite mods
I think I have to stay very very far away from that park that offers pony rides that I mentioned a long time ago
Before this pony craze
6Agreed on all counts.
Otherwise
><
6Also, !!Rarity is a guy.
STILL
6Only female mods are !!PinkiePie and !!Scootaloo
He's awesome
6He is.
;o
*yawn*
I MUST hide this from my sister
Or else
I will NEVER live it down
Hide what, this?
She is already teasing me for Pokémon!
This pony thing?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
</Darth Vader>
Is it really the end of the world if she does?
=\
YES
It's the end of EVERYTHING
EVERYTHING
why didnt i delve into the magic of pony chan sooner
I could rather get crushed to death by 200 bendy buses
Also
Hope you're just trolling.
No
I'm sereious
*serious
/me goes to tell his sister about his pony obsession
"Um. You've got a yacht. And... Boys! Loads of fellas. Hunky guys down there. Possibly even a boyfriend! Who's to say at this stage. But, a lot of good looking fellas down there. And, ah, a boy band as well! That haven't seen a woman in years. And they're not picky at all. They don't care if you've got a bit of brain damage. If you've been running around sweating. And... A farm! A pony
farm! And... Just jump down, would ya?"
Wheatley says that at some point in Portal 2
If you go back to the bottomless pit
Oo;;;
Eh
Dunno what to say but honestly why get scared by your sister if she finds out about Pokemon chat sites...
Unless she'll send you to the nearest asylum for it
Then there's a problem
I now know why Portal 2 and MLP: FiM gets crossed so much
she might
MIGHT
she will
anyone with a MLP: FiM obsession needs to go to a correction center

Such an old GIF, still good though.
06I mean I really don't care about the ponies in any way - neither positive nor negative - unless it's like PONIESPONIESPONIES in the middle of some actual conversation.
06Same as spamming really.
06:3
Generally there's no one talking when I post ponies anyway, and I don't spam it, so I don't see why people complain.
It's pretty easy to ignore, hell, they can even set me to ignore so it doesn't show up.

Were they made in China?

what does cliche mean somewhat
4But, if that's your decision I have no choice but to accept it
I still don't reallly know
13cliché = something that is used so often it becomes rather predictable and loses its effectiveness

6Hello. XD
8what about it sprinkles?
6Just your voicing your general fed-upness.
6Yes, that's a word now.
No you're not.

You're shitting me.
Quite possibly not? Impressive, eh?
8yeah

6Wow, all my tired just hit me like a sack of bricks.
No die

8of course the soldier unleashed one of his brilliant posts while i was writing, so now im sucked back in
Pretty much that's what I meant
6Soldier does that.
8its so weird
Remember the white lines are for loading and not the red lines
8its like he reaches into my brain, takes my thoughts and makes them coherent
the red lines are for loading and the white lines are not
6He seems to do that with a lot of things.
you idiot it the white lines that are for boarding and the red lines that are prohibited
6But I don't like the giant wall of text thing.
/me doesn't get whaled
6I love that he gives great advice, but the walls of text are... bleh.
lol Airplane
8i normally dont, but im ok with it when he does it
8most long posts like that i dont read because i dont want to invest the time, but its totally worth it for his posts
Pot pies always taste better when you have to wait unreasonable amounts of time for them.
6Cursed sleep schedule and my lack of one.
6I'm probably going to go get coffee soon...

8why does it refresh?
lolz no wai

6Just does it every now and then.
6All of Chrome refreshes for some odd reason.
8wut
8i have chrome and it doesnt do anything like that to me
6It's my comp.
6My comp is just... weird.
6I need to fix so many bugs, really. XD
6The other day it wasn't letting me access any images except the ones in my Recently Changed or whatever it's called.
6But I got that fixed.
Hai guys :)
8weird
HML :D
/me glomps
8i had a virus for a while that wouldnt let me shut down my computer
6That's... incredibly odd.
8so i had to manually turn the power off everytime and run scandisk
8it also made it so that, after a certain amount of time, no programs would open
/me falls over
6Oh, one of those.
6I've only ever herd about those a couple times. Are they as a pain in the flank to get rid of as they say?

/me agrees
8!!PinkiePie finally autosaged that thread
Lol, you know that's an MLP meme right?
6Thank the lord.
06The 20% cooler part I assume because calling rainbow text a meme would be madness

/me gives Espeon a cookie

Celestia?
02Hi~
Espeon: yeah.

floof

6Hey Ghosties

lol
6Good evening.
6And good to hear DCD
about the PSPVita=me goes o.o
It was probably just cheaper for them not to provide it (like after a year no PS3s were at all backwards compatible).
3G+Wifi? come on..you have got to be kidding me..

Just one or two episodes.
Episode of what?
An acid trip.
O_o
o.o
What
Oh, that
I loved that show/anime, even though everyone else should hate it :P
(Do not watch, if you like sanity .v.)
everyone here is insane
take a wild guess when they watch this
You are right :P
PSG style > MLP

You told me :P

someone else

and see if it notices you.

We'll see about that after season 2
That show was more just disturbing than anything.
Wat
10Just weirdest anime ever
It's like an acid trip.
in the bot's status window:
USER Not enough parameters

10Puella Magi > PSG
10:3
wat
8sprinkles, i didnt know you were a getter
Since I dislike regular anime
:|
6Yes.
I dunno.
Nothing wrong with the script.
6I'm top 3 currently.
It works fine for me.
6Though the top 5 is INCREDIBLY close.
everything >owns> JB >likes> MLP
/me RUNS
10Speaking of that, it's amazing that I've kept the same forum theme for over a month
8nice
13I still need to watch PSG sometime
10I usually change every week or every 2 weeks
lightlugia: I suppose we'll agree to disagree then.
because your just that awesome
8i dont get, but i have gotten dubs, trips, quads and quints before
13I've been told that I might get bored of it after a while, but we'll see :B
/me SHOT
6I have the magical inability to GET quints.
I've kept the same theme for ______ months.
:D
!admincommands
10It does get boring
/me didnt change it for a year_
8i got them accidentally one day
'cause I'm boring like that.
nope.
A couple of episodes are boring at times :P
year+
ergh
i'm gonna ask i #mIRC
But the others are odd
in*
10Especially episode... 7? With the Transformers reference
That wasn't boring at all XD
/me checks
10I thought so
Now episode 8/9 I think
Fun
6I saw that.
8accidental both times, because all my gets are accidental
8i was a little worried
13How many episodes are there?
6My first post on ponychan was actually a 777.
Twelve I think.
13ish
1013
10with an OVA
Including a 10min episode thingy
13Ah, I'll probably watch the whole thing then :B
10I finished it in 2 days (yesterday, and the day before)
Good luck, Angel.
I finished in January XD
10The one thing that's good about PSG is...
10the soundtrack
Or something close...
Yes, the music
And the suggestiveness too :P
Nah.
Soundtrack only.
8nice
13The art style is good too~
8my 1st was a dubs
10And the best song is the angel's transformation theme
I tend not to like anime anyway.
8 1st as a tripfriend i should say
10Espy, I think it's too much similar to PPG XD

I once beat a snake in a staring contest.
o.o seriously?
6I used to lurk 4chan. Never posted though.

it was tough
but I prevailed in the end.
snakes are skilled and clever foes.
How? Don't they have no eyelids?
Very carefully.
(I don't know much about snakes)
6Wow, I MUST be tired.
6I just realized I was furiously refreshing when I still had to wait another 900 posts for a big GET.
8lol
So I made ramen for lunch, but the employee lounge apparently ran out of plastic forks
So I'm using coffee stirers for chop sticks
Get two pens and use them as chopsticks.

6I know. That's why I did so many more.
4What the fuck
6XD Ghosties.
6Randomly dari posting in red.
6With a red name. Oo
6XD well I don't want your silly notices that make it seem like I'm seeing things.
6GET OUT OF MY HEAD
6...too easy to make a joke out of that.
6I don't have a house, silly text voice.
6It is, silly willy walnut head.
4Oh jesus
4Well, this could go very bad
6I'M DANCIN' I'M DANCIN'
6So am I, silly chat voice.
4You guys know there's a thread over on /pony/ about the Wired topic that talked about Bronies, yeah?
6Did not know that, Ghosties.
4Well, there is
6What question, silly voice?
4I said something about how the media always finds the worst representations of communities to portray to the rest of the world, and I said that the general public now probably think we're all middle aged manbabies with Asperger's syndrome that have nothing better to do than collect MLP toys from McDonalds
4Now, I didn't read anything else in the thread, I just said what I wanted to say
4After posting, I scrolled up a little and do you know what I saw?
6...we can do that?
6Explain how, silly voice.
4I saw Luke Allen
4posting
8luke allen?
2hiya everyone
4The middle aged manbaby with Asperger's syndrome that collects MLP toys from McDonalds
6Oh, I saw that thread already, Ghosties.
Itsa bl
Heya BL :3
8ah
4This could end very, very baddly
4*badly
6...tell me how, oh wise voice.
2hey Aurora
2TWIINIE :3
2FUDGE
4Like I really need Luke Allen to comment on me commenting on him
Hi :D
6That would be cool, Ghosties.
2I miss being here constantly D:
4Dude, Sprinkles
Heya! :)
Lol
2meep o-o
8thats gonna end in a shitstorm
and
4Yeah
4Exactly
AURORA
/me glomps a Aurora
long time no see :o
4The entirety of Ponychan is gonna come down on me

/me huggles the Wing
6How? Where?
2i'm gonna be out of school for good on Wednesday, FINALLY graduating
4In the Wired thread. All Allen has to do is see my post and reply to me and it would commence a torrential shitstorm that targets me
/me is already out of school
6Wow, it does load a LOT faster.
8well shit man, i dont know what to tell you
8too bad the soldier isnt here
2has LL been on in a while?
4I don't even wanna get that guy involved
04Mew
04BL
04:D
I dunno, havent see her much
4The last thing I want is for Soldier to come "save the day"
or it*
so BL, how's life?
04also yay I got attacks to deal damage
Where's the thread anyway?
04http://www.megaswf.com/serve/1129686
4I think I'm just gonna ask the mods to take my post down because I REALLY don't want to see what the result is gonna be
awesomeness :o
2boring except for my boyfriend
4It's in /pony/ dari
ah, okays.
6Dari, you are amazing.
2but I need to hang with more people than just him
I see
2nobody else ever calls me to hang out anymore, and it makes me sad
2yes
04:c
wow
04that sucks BL
you didn"t knew? o.o
04Go out and meet some people?
nope
ah, okays. thought you did.
8just delete it ghosties
BL: hang out with bffs?

2yes, down the road
8weird
2or up
2LOL
thats what she said
2D:<
4Okay, never mind
4I got it
4What a fucking relief
2I like cookies o3o
/me 2noms cookie
Why did you want to delete it so badly?
2COOKIES?!]
2fjrsgurguifhejd
/me 2noms more cookies
4I mean, I'm not afraid to speak my mind but I sure as shit don't wanna be ostracized from the community because of some guy that everybody probably looks up to as an "inspiration"
4I have no doubt that people in Ponychan flocked to Luke Allen
Don't even know who that is.
4So any kind of negative response was going to be met with immediate mudslinging
/me walks into the woods and noms on some of his cookies
8did you read the wired article?
4I did, I read it yesterday
I TL;DR'd it.
2cookies*
6Dari, this is amazing. You are my god.
Hahaha.
/me runs
(:
/me hides in a cave with many halls
2COOKIES!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!!??
i read balls
/me flees
MFAO
4Luke Allen is a 31 year old guy with Asperger's syndrome that collects MLP toys from McDonalds. And as sad as I think that sounds, I was using him as an example of how the general public will think of the rest of our community
L*
[03:54:54 pm] <luna> i'm gonna ask i #mIRC
herp
/me hides behind a rock
Ohhhh...Ouch...
4I didn't realize that he was posting in the thread, however
2COOKIES NAO
4Until AFTER I posted
but...
Yeah, that's unlucky.
but...
4And then it hit me like a ton of bricks when I realized that if he says *one thing* to me, the entirety of Ponychan would rush to his aid and swarm me with bullshit
4That's the kind of intolerance I'm talking about on Ponychan
2NUH UH D:<
/me 2snarls
4People wouldn't understand where I was coming from and would IMMEDIATELY call me a parasprite and shit
4Except for Max Rain, he knew what I was talking about *shrugs*
/me eeps at lighty coming out of nowhere
o.o
/me hides
8too much drama on /pony/ for me
8it gets way too serious
/me growls "MINEEEEEEEEE!"

/me tries to sneak of with his cookies down the hall
-was*
/me 2blinks
People seem to want to make out as though there's some big dramatic thing happening the whole time.
8i think part of it is The Great Pony Drought of 2011
(hi black latios :3)
/me runs
4Do you at least know where I'm coming from, Hip? I really didn't mean to insult Allen, I was just commenting on how the public probably think we're all middle aged men with Asperger's syndrome that collects MLP toys from McDonalds. I admit that I shouldn't have left the "manbaby" part in there, that was a huge mistake on my behalf.
Hahaha, quite possibly.
2hiya Nick :3
8oh no, i understand and agree with you ghosties
/me is tackled to the ground
4Good. I know I can be an asshole, but I do care
8but like i posted in that thread about the picture of dash in the kitchen today
/me still hold on to the cookies
8IMMEDIATE SHITSTORM
I'm not really bothered about what the media says.
4Huh, I remember that thread. I lurked but I didn't read much
2cookies pwease? o3o
4Where was the thread at, Hip?
4@dari: Bags supposedly said "who cares if the rest of the world thinks we're all pedophiles?" yesterday
4I mean, do YOU want the rest of the world to think every guy that likes MLP is a pedo?
/me crys
I guess I can give you one
2meep?
I'm still not bothered, if they think I'm a paedophile for watching a TV show, then they don't deserve to talk to me. :)
/me steal it
HAH! MINE!
/me 2squeals with joy and eats cookie, keeping a stern eye on lightlugia
Somehow I doubt anyone will really care anway.
/me 2tackles lightlugia and uses Ice Beam
4I hope you're right
/me falls over but isn't affected by icebeam
"Ohh, adults watching ponies, that's sad" is probably the extent of it.
/me trys to walk away with the rest off his cookies minus the ones he gave to them
how long till the pre show?
8*ponyshrug*
8whenever DCD gets back
i see lol
8hopefully it will be soon though
/me trys to walk off into another hall
/me 2hands a cookie to lightlugia and turns away, crossing her arms
http://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh235/thelugia/100_1330.jpg
8also, remember how i said i was convinced the soldier was inside my head and was translating my thoughts into eloquent posts?
8he just did it again
/me sits and enjoys another one of his 50 cookies
4Where?
He said something I don't at all agree with.
"Part of my wants to blame the schooling system here. Most areas only have the option of Spanish or French and don't begin teaching them until Middle School. I didn't begin Spanish classes until 7th grade, or in other words, until I was 13. A 13 year old's mind is not able to perceive new languages well."
Wut
You can't learn a new language well at 13?
2O-o
You can learn a new language at any age. :/
/me runs of into a secret room
I hope i CAN HIDE THESE COOKIES
/me 2sits there confused
a wild charizard entered!
/me throws masterball at it!
You can learn a new language better at 25 than you can at 13.
8ghosties, in that thread i made
4Ah, yeah, I just saw his post
/me eats another one of his cookies
If you're learning a new language at 25 it's because you want to, and you will put effort in, at 13 you most likely aren't bothered at all and will put no effort in.
8i think he was talking about as compared to young children, which is true
4Oh, did some shameless plugging for a "what are you doing?" thread on /oat/ :D
mfw I began learning english at ~10 yo
I like you guys
You can learn a new language easily if you grow up with it, sure, but that's REALLY young, you probably wouldn't ever remember learning it.
/me 2smirks and noms cookie
At 7 you wouldn't learn it better than at 13.
Other than if you had reached the point at 13 where you couldn't be bothered to learn it.
4Dari, I tried taking Spanish in the tenth grade and then Spanish 2 in the 11th grade.
4I barely remember any Spanish at all : /
8i took spanish every year starting in 6th grade
8still not particularly good at it
4I'm sure you're better at Spanish than I am :P
8hell, my roommate is majoring in spanish, has been taking it for 3 years at an advanced university level and lived in spain for a few months, and he still isnt fluent
My uncle took French when he was 13.
He didn't put much effort into it and wasn't very good.
8but my 6 year old brother, since they taught spanish at his pre-school when he was a toddler, can speak spanish better than i can
When he was older he paid for lessons, and is fluent.
mfw I used the wrong name.
Age has nothing to do with it.
4I dunno, Dari. I've heard through psychology that your brain absorbs information better at a younger age, thus making learning another language much easier than trying to learn it later in life
OHAI
4Hello, Peanut
8o hai peanut
At a younger age than most school starts.
13Hows it goin everypony
4Alright, I suppose
2bbl
8dari, studies have shown that young children learn languages more easily than older people
I've seen studies that suggest the opposite.
hows it going everyone?
13When does the uh
I'm kinda surprised that quit message is still getting used. lol
4I HATE YOU, COMBUSTIBLELEMONS
At a younger age you put little to no effort in and I know NO ONE who has become fluent from taking a lanugage at shcol these past 6 years.
13Er. Nvm.
4Nah, I'm just fucking with ya
D: Y U NO LIKE ME D:
oh lol
4I hate everybody
4*shrugs*
They tested how much 25 year old people learnt, against how much 13 year olds learnt, the 25 year old people raped the 13 year old kids.
ghosties is secretly francis from l4d
/me walks down the hallway with his cookies
8im talking younger though
4I bet you'd like that, wouldn't you lemon?
8like 4 year olds versus 14 year olds
Rochelle would
Lol, if you could get the 14 year olds to put in any effort they'd do better.
4Nobody likes Rochelle
I could go and learn a whole French dictionary in a week.
4Nobody
But I'm too lazy to invest the time.
So uh
Hai
A 4 year old couldn't do that.
I don't thats for certain
Why did bill have to die D:
Glad you could find us, lol

I've done pretty much no work in all my years at school.

better
4I was just about to say, haha
8dari, that post basically described me in high school
4Well, I suppose I'm glad that somebody likes me
aww :(
Lawl, Ghosties, don't pretend we don't all love you.
Us bronies gotta stick together
we all love you ^_^
4I have some pretty unpopular opinions on Ponychan
8at the risk of sounding like an arrogant dick, i am very smart, but i put in 0 work in high school because it was pointless and boring to me
4Hipster's such an arrogant dick
13I used to have that song
^agreed ^^ lol
<3
People in my family tend to get good results at school, but we put in pretty much no effort other than for the final tests that actually matter.
ooh. People are already here
meh i think having a fun life is more important than school
8having homework assignments where you match people to the dates they were born is not productive to me
8and yet, that's what most of high school was
8and word searchees
I got pretty good at avoiding all the punishment, hahaha.
8searches*
Tell them I handed in my homework, make them think they lost the book.
4@Apokalipse: Yeah, we should be getting started fairly soon. The actual BMN will begin at 7

LOVE LOVE LOVE
Elky: Yeah, pushing stuff on people is the easiest way to make it more univserally disliked.
^exactly
yep, it comes dangerously close to trolling
if people waste their time trolling us though i find that sad
10Nevermind, I figured it out
so why should bronies do it back?
Well at least when I started this Epic Rap Battle business, it was on accident.
06And Sky LOL at that pic, somehow it fits better than expected.
8DCD, so much hate
our way is tolerance not fighting fire with fire :/
8whats happening?
HATE HATE HATE when my mom gets a weekday off
She siphons all my time with her errands
Not home yet and it's almost an hour and half to showtime!
I feel sorry for anyone who can't stand that song.

From your computer.

November is good because it's closer to ponies.
@Combustiblelemons I just had a mental picture of Obama standing outside the queens window holding a stereo playing some love song from the 90's.
6Yep, especially since they rearranged the place so all the outlets are RIGHT NEXT to the singer.
hi guys
6I could reach out and touch the guitars from here.
Beat, i think that may happen one day
Well, so much for not being on for a month, damn you guys, tearing me away from my work. :P

When I first got mIRC so many years ago, someone gave me a 'calculator' script.
Of course what it actually did was let people control my computer.
Hahaha.
8i'll just put it in the selection thread, DCD
may I post ponified what is love by haddaway?
They turned it off.

8that way it will bump it too
Taught me an important lesson.

6...I really want to see that...
nooo, that means a smaller chance for me
we need a bit of entertainment here I think :/
Don't accept when you don't know what they do. XD Sort of, they could use the command to do pretty much anything.
well? D:
lmao
Like make me post my IP address and stuff.
uh...
why didnt you just unload the script, lol.
6...anypony else care?
I'll put it up anyway :/

Helps me to understand what does what and etc.
Ah yeah, I need to get back to the mumble, I'm having withdrawal issues.

And Gene Wilder Curt
So we aren't looking at black screen. It's just me.
First three are great

@ Combustiblelemons: Its really funny

black screen
No, I cant see black screen, I see Attorney at Law
Also I'm probably the only person here who LIKES the Mario movie
Never seen it
No, you're not the only one.
live action mario?
I see Phoenix in a beanie, myself.
yes
Super Mario Bros is the bad movie?
eww
im back 8D
8for people who don't know, we randomize our schedule each week so it doesn't get predictable and boring
EWWWW
yes
it depends on what you mean by like it
Statement: I am also fond of the Super Mario Bros. movie, master.
hello :)
all movies based on video games fail
Is anypony else experiencing mild chat lag?
except for a certain few
can we get a little insight into todays randomized schedule? :3
I expected to see a movie. not ace attorney
what if they make a halo movie?
nope greyfire
That movie was too gloomy for my interests as a kid.
Maybe put today's lineup in the channel topic?
DON'T. EVEN. SAY THAT. MLP.
yay, I can see
FOREVER
I consider it an unironicly good film
Halo already sucks, so the worst case scenario the movie sucks just as badly.
you suck
>.>
Metal gear solid 4 is practically a movie
People don't get murdered over simple games?
6 hours of awesome cutscenes :D
apollos getting recked
I'm Sahara hasn't played in honor of Uncharted.

MGS4 sucks
Weren't there stories of people getting killed over video games?

MGS 4 a movie? I guess if you like movies that take days to finish
BLASPHEMY
y does it suck?
It owns!
nooo! I wanted to see what happened next!

too hard trying to make the plot deep
not really
Ooh, we need to watch the Final Fantasy movie some time, Spirits Within, not Advent Children.
there are stories about people getting killed over anything
11Wazzup?
they're tying up all the questions we had from mgs2
About half a dozen times in the past decade have people been in the news, being killed for games.
Hey Silverscreen
final fantasy is a movie by itself
they did it well I say
I've never seen Spirits Within, which game is it about?
None.
None.
wait
its not canon ff
I see.
im confused
Yeah spirits is its own thing
whos the laywer for the defendant

OBCEPTION

and whos the prosecutioner lawyer?
Hello, everypony.

I think the player is the one with the red coat
hmm..
Hipster_Brony theres a play button? i cent see it...
*banishes the internet to the moon and trots away*

heck, I'll try IE
8lol internet explorer
@brownd try reloading the page

Wine bottles can be pretty thick.

and then exploded
and exploded again
lol
brb
NOPE. Mountain Dew Pitch Black still tastes like shit.
8brownd, did you try closing your browser and opening it again?
6Brownd, restart your comp.
Why not use Firefox? It's 20% Cooler than IE.
4Alright
i dunno with enough force to kill someone a bottle should smash
6Gets it working every time.
8yo ghosties
hairboner
hello
unless the glass is like 3 inches thick
Violence against hair
Thats what you get for having an ostentacious Japanese hairstyle.
If the bottle smashes the force will be dramatically reduced.

Mrs. Orly, really now - lol
for me its a debate between fluttershy and rainbow dash
PINKE PIE!!
I wonder if playing this game will help me pass my Government final...
Everypony knows Applejack is best pony
Orly Tates
@Pungrongo Dash, Fluttershy, Dash, Fluttershy DEAE LORD I SUCK WITH DECISCIONS
Fluttershy is a tree
Rainbow dash/fluttershy are best. no questioning it.
Furthermore, if we were doing a pre-show, would people still have to post their suggestions in the discussion thread on /chat/?
fluttershy is so cute
Eyup.
Women watching My Little Pony? Preposterous! Ponies are for the manliest of manly men type men! Women watch girly gunk like wrestling and football.
Shocking!
Fluttershy, Raindbow Dash, Applejack, in that order
orly miss orly?
OH REALLY, MS. ORLY?!
OH REALLY, MISS ORLY
Oh really, Mrs. Orly?? XD
You do know Fluttershy isn't a tree?
this game
Flutteryshy/Applejack
I don't really like applejack
yeah, but we arent tonight
is just
who was phone?
wow
damn, the stream keeps cutting out on me
6I love how the judge is holding info and you get it as you go. Real courts totally work like this.
Pinkie pie is clearly the best pony. How can you even think otherwise? Read Cupcakes too much?
Pinkamena (crazy Pinkie), Trixie, and Twilight in that order
also, in the future, im just gonna have people do it on the /oat/ thread
Pink Pony is Best.
pinkie pie is my 3rd favourite ^_^
DashiePie
DAT LIFEBAR
I have Fluttershy and Rarity tied as my favorite ponies
obviousley apple jack
the great and powerful? Pfft.
the suggestions will keep it bumped, and it doesnt look like the mods are moving it
totally have no idea how this game works
damnit, mr justice!
So, this is ace attorney, never seen gameplay before...
Cool
Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Applejack, Twilight, Pinkie, Rarity.
Neihter have I
Applejack? Silly, that's not how you spell Pinkie Pie.
Derpy is the best pony
I just hope it won't be pushing our luck
THERE IS NO LOCKET ON HIM
There's no locket!
is this a video or live gameplay?
Rainbow Dash is best pony.
Luna haters
Yep, it's all true.
DUN DUN DUNNN
Fluttershy
I honestly can't decide. I like them all.
Spike is best dragon
inorite
Luna is best royalty
Anyone had a pony dream yet?
You know you're correct when the music stops.
Not yet
Trixie is best Trixie
The butler did it
I did

I had a dream of "Cupckakes"

I can only ever remember the dreams I have after I've already woken up, and I've dozed off again in bed
Yeah I thought this was Pheonix Wright, I'm confused
Mmmm apple pies
Yes, that's Phoenix. Defense attorney gone defendant.
cool story bro
sounds more like an ambulance than a game system
If she's Ms. Orly where's Mr. Yarly
Skyrim on Wii U would be epic
and a dream where I met Twilight Sparkle in RL
Rainbow Dash breaks her leg after failing to do a trick
4There's no way Skyrim would ever be ported over to the Wii
This is Ace Attourney, yes.
Unfortunately, they only ever happen on weekdays
i dont think so, derpy was the only one who ever objected to it, and he said he wont move it unless it gets reported
Wii U. Now I play videogames while I play videogames.
4...maybe the Wii U
why is Apollo Justice playing?
And Phoenix Wright is in here.
when I had mine I automatically went and posted it on PonyChan before I could forget it
6Is this girl like, 5?
It's just the Apollo Justice line
Alright
0In this game, phoenix ain't a lawyer anymore cuz he did something wrong. Can't remember what tho.
I haven't finished this game.
had a daughter?
spoilers lol
I got a lot farther than this though.
Lol, methinks.
Because Miles Edgeworth can be kind of a troll
HOLD IT!
But now he has an awesome beanie to make up for it.
YELLING
I played the first two ace attorney games
Oh, this one.
She's gonna take of the coat. Just wait.
"Methinks"? I didn't know this is 1605
then I got sick of all the KEEP TRYING EVERYTHING UNTIL YOU GET IT RIGHT
0Played the first 3 Ace Attorney games.
4Wow, DCD HOLDS everything lol

PRESS HARDER
7000, why not 900 points D:
HOLD IT!

I see what they did thar
9000*
OBJECTION!
OBJECTIION

the hell
Poker chips r poker chips
9I know the contradiction
Mmm, fish and chips...
9just looking where to present evidence
Don't need yer fancy maths!
I think there's only one or two spots where pressing harder is a bad idea.

If that.
I wish courtroom cases were like this in real life

4Huh, you don't say
KYM, I'm such a newfag

how did everyone here become a brony?
I am VERY intent on this video...
watched the show
ITS A CONSPIRACY
I hope it will be an ero ero movie
curiousity
KYM is dominated by bronies.
Dikekike
a friend introduced it to me, and i loved the show
But KYM IS a good source of pics
didn't even think of that, I've always looked at it in the confines of a television show
The planets aligned
KYM here too.
Luna, what does the scouter say about Twilight's friendship level?
4chan pointed me to the show
Mind = Blown
mryardovich made me a brony on youtube
Oh, me? FunnyJunk.
I watched the show = Brony
I become a brony while reading the MC forums.
over 9000
true
I got swept up in /co/ ponies all the way from /tg/
I was curious after looking at all the fuss online
fellow brony pointed me to the show
KYM MADE ME A BRONY!

Ahh, that got it.

4I blame Bandpuffs for telling me to watch the show
Saw it being uploaded by MAST3RLINKX, then saw it on KYM, then decided to check it out.
TWO ACES OF SPADES!
Watched funny pony videos, watched show, fell in love with Fluttershy.
Pony Photo
I found it on Equestia Daily.
two ace of spades, from my point of view
what no
Bandpuffs is awesome
First i saw some awesome desktop wallpapers, then i watched the show as it piqued my interest
why did it change my nickname?
OBJECTION!!!
1 ace spade 1 ace club
Four aces@
one is a club
I just came here from equestria daily what in the wide wide world of equestria is this?
Thats a clubs
each has full house
Some of my IRC friends are the reason I'm a brony.
yeah bandpuffs
HOLD IT
Alrighty finnaly got the chat to work

Thing is, Cheat isn't obvious.
Is this his first time playing Apolo Justice?
Thurz two aces of spadez!
Although this would appear to be that Lawyer game.
FOUR ACES, ITS FOUR ACES
4Combustiblelemons: Yes, he is
HOLD IT BRONY

A hand! very funny...
I guess it depends on what the next movie is.
I'll never understand how anyone could think they can get away with playing a fifth ace when everyone knows damn well a deck of cards only has 4
A hand!? EPIC PUN IS WPIC
ba dum tiss

Why not, Bristle :/
Anyone seen the pinkie pie core?

Yeah, where is the Phoenix Wright/Pony Cross over game?
I want to see pinkie pie core after this case concludes.
Because there is no way I could guess that XD
I wish real court was this exciting...
A brony is still working on a Portal mod for pony
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/2471
fancy mathematic
I hope nopony references cupcakes during the show...
if only courtrooms were really this intense
bristle, you missed last week
the origin of flutewood
Portal or Portal 2?
*hammer*
That's why we've been trying to change the mod room so it's less obvious
They are in Japan!
I've been in court before. It's boring...
haha start coming up with pony names for random characters
@lyarbon YOU JUST DID YOU FOOL
hammer!
well when i saw her get pissed at rainbow
The Pony Phoenix wright crossover was awesome
0@mib_womx5c give him all my money.
Phenox Wright would make the BEST judge Judy episode
our legal system is messed up over here in britain :/
I see, good idea actually
i staretd thinkiing bout it
wait, why not look at both?
So I got introduced to what is apparently the weirdest anime ever.

USA
We were making a table?
PAYNE

Because the fourth will never reach the US
i love the music for this game

If I remember right

they always do
theres a lobster
so far it hasnt been an issue though
Yeah.
This is the last coutroom game by the phoenix wright people.
Yes, she got the death sentence.
it's my mom's old one from like, ten years ago
wait is her second name Orly?
This chapter has already had it's murdered character.
So I suppose it doesn't matter.
@misterbristle this is the fourth one that has his "prodoge"
So much clicking
I prefer Miles Edgeworth
she comes back without the coat
D:
HAT
Yarly, she's Orly
Then there was the investigation game with Miles Edgeworth.

Should we get on lyrabon for contstantly posting links to music?

OBJELADCTION
Besides, what would the cutie mark of a pony who's talent was being ridiculous even look like?
CORRECTION
dari, we'll make one for next week
0Can't wait for Layton vs wright. Even if i can't understand anything!
So is it safe to say that Mario should start around 7:30?
Oh jeez, now i have to play this game
no
Wright's boyfriend dumped him
think mario kart
Now boys and girls, who implied who was using Blue Cards?
the defendants defending himself
never played mario kart
except you can completely customize everything
Is someone making a pony version?
Obama
ghosties, they can post links until the stream starts, you might want to let him know ahead of time tho
I think I heard about it.
no, but close
blue is just a darker shade of red
0So thats where i have seen that guy before (Phoenix)
OBAMA
He looks so.... laid back
where can i get this game
What wwould Payne's cutie mark be?
He who has himself for a lawyer has a fool for a client.
I like how Phoenix as the witness goes around trolling his defendant
that was our first game we got for our PS3
13 12 minutes everypony
and my first character I made was Pinkie
13=D
during
I think it turned out
is this the same phoenix?
*yaaaaaay*
bristle, DCD is playing it to kill time before the stream starts
after!
What would Aphex Twins cutie mark be like as werid as his music
ya-hoo!
Same pheonix, yeah
hed have a pedo mark
We need a Payne pony
Hmm...am I actually here now? *unsure how this thing works*
I want the blind bag ponies.
I'll get a screenshot and show you guys
This is the same Phoenix, but older.
BUT TWELVE BACKWWARDS IS 35
Blue is just red, a little further up the spectrum.
cool
But apparently they're only made in Germany. :/
and whoo, brony movies are midnight. Silly timezones
Objection i have bird hair!

Heya Raider, fellow UK Pony <3
Timezones... can't explain it.. fukken magic o.0
11:49 here

Im form the UK aswell
oh yeah, sure
WORLD, Y U NO FLAT
TIMEZONE! HOW DO THEY WORK?
what do you need it for?
Olga Orly?
I am also form the UK.
I am fine with this. Many UK ponies
Rainbows and magnets
I don't think this case will conclude by the time the movies will start.
Pft, we should do away with timezones and all run on the same clock.
Lol, this chat is TQ;DR (my coinage of just now).
Oh, and I sent a PM to lyrabon to stop posting links when the show starts
critically anyway
i never really understood timezones either *shrugs*
It's 3:50 here'
I is from the UK, xD
Her names Orly? Mind=Blown
Doing away with time zones would make no sense!
West Coast
Orly?
6:51
Getting rid of timezones would be nice, but Celestia's sun doesn't allow it
I isn't from the UK
But he looks like a crazy hipster/jogger/rapper dude, what is wrong with him!
let me just upload it again
and im from texas, i say we need to seceed again
Hello, everypony!
Yup!
The world isn't flat, Equestria on the other hand is
You'd have people waking up at midnight because the sun would be rising.
I didn't understand timezones until I had to learn them to wrangle out scheduling conflicts for TF2 highlander stuff.
heh
heh
might want to warn publicly next time, so everypony can see it
EHEHEHEH
Finland here.
Moon>Sun
hivemind
heh.
Now I can do them easy.
184 bronies in the chat now.
Getting close. :P
hah, TF2 highlander matches.
Will do, Hip
Good times.
Midnight>Noon
moon>sun indeed
If equestria is flat then why are the sun and moon in the ponyverse round?
Pinkie pie is hilarious in this episode
Jood: Eeyup.
a new direction
I don't have a preference. I love the sun and moon equally.
luuunnnaaaaa
that's why i'm awake now
would you like emokarp or my badass mudkip as well?
Luna is pleased with these brit ponies watching films at midnight
Banished to the sun!
13I have no idea what's going on in this game.

7Same here Peanut

0pony>9000

8 9 minutes until the movie
I DON'T GET IT ANY MORE
luna should banish trollestia to the sun
Phoenix Wright logic
Is there a we need an offical pony steam group
We have one.

It seems that the Chat and Video only work if I'm typing or moving the mouse. Any ideas why?

Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

KAMEN RIDER.

OBJECTION, My finger is pointing!
8armlec: young frankenstein and super mario bros
@Klonoa79H You are awesome officially xD
There's another Kamen Rider fan here? :O

MLP FiM>everything

Kamen Rider Black RX was the best.
Nails on a chalk board>Kesha.

Twenty Minutes, great. I can watch an Episode of Ponies whilst I wait...
THIS EVIDENCE CLEARLY INDICATES SOMETHING ELSE
Recess? IMMA PLAY ON THE SWINGS
I never saw Black RX.
Is there a time when next weeks selections will be made?
Gravity-defying hair is a logical objection to everything.
I told you bro
But Hibiki is my favorite Kamen Rider.
9KAMEN RIDER
I remember why I didn't like the story on this game that much. It doesn't really flesh out Apolo as an important character very much, but its still fun.
I know, I'm weird.
9KUROI BODY
4Hi ya'll~
9KAMEN RIDER
9MAKANAMEEE

Everyone seems to hate Go-Onger.
So... is Maya in this one?

Giga Drill Breaker?
slide ftw
6Mine is the drill that pierces Objections?
I'M CALLING OUT TO SCATMAN'S WORLD
Problem with Apollo Justice is Phoenix just steals the Main Character slot at critical moments in the game.

Hi lollercoaster
Hey, everpony!
I always thought dash made her house, she moves clouds for a living
I hope it does wolf...not gonna lie...still cant stand the intro song -_-
I owe you for all this
"répondez s'il vous plaît"
The opening should be anime like
Does anyone know why my video freezes when I'm not moving my cursor?
I hope they extend the theme at some point
I'd imagine clouds are the absolutely cheapest building material ever, so you can afford to make your house extravagant.

Uh oh she is being chased

SCIENCE DOESN'T FUCKING WORK LIKE THAT
That's asking a lot of the audience?
mario mario and luigi mario
So Luigi is a conspiracy theorist that happens to be correct.
oh good god it's not
6My Italian heritage is dying inside right now.
It's Daisy's Mom!
This looks like a job for a fat guy with a 'stache
NEW ZEALAND FUCKING REPRESENT
Then it would be... nothing like the Mario games. At all.
Maybe, DCD, but Silver, Hipster, and I agree that it gets annoying
End well, this will not.
HI SHE'S DAISY!
well time for the first borring 20 mins
The fuck?
shing
DCD, it's not a problem to be used now and then, and yes, the viewers like it, but it starts to grind when you do it every five seconds.
Science shouldn't be about "why?", it should be about "why not?"!
*rub
that said
it's macguffin time!
Nice egg, good egg
Give her a Tanooki Leaf if you want her to be safe.
Hahaha, SirSprinkles, I feel sorry for you. :P

Good going egg
13i think i'm gonna watch game of thrones instead
Illusion is my hero now
I am more italian then this, and I'm half irish
or the episodes, for the matter
Do we ever find out why she's running?
gonna do them after them
Yeah, the italian in me is hurting too.
if sony fused with nintendo this is the new mario
I wouldn't care if you did it like once
followed by the next boring 20 mins
0Its Zelda trying to GTFO of this movie
Please look after my baby Krptonian, oh and don't let her near any glowing green rocks from space.
lolnun
Now that's a good idea.
did john williams compose this music?
Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that someponies just should NEVER make real life movies that are video game adaptations.
Gotta say, the music is quite nice
A nun is the new mario?
But not over whole scenes or whatever
she wants out of the movie
Holywood sure makes really bad movies
Make for a good post-show.
Mostly as a pinchy elbow.
ok, i can live with that DCD
im not italian and my italian is hurting
Five minutes in- more complicated than Inception?
hhhahahahaha Arcesious you bet
post show is a good idea
Post show would be just fine
Man, the milkman just doesn't do his job like he used to/.
Why couldn't they have made a Portal movie?
I'll go watch True Grit
Jay Walking?!
Chika, lawl

I'M more Italian than this, and I'm mostly French!
Just not actually during the stream, yeah?

Suddenly Jesus
We want a Portal movie, dammit!
omg I know my composers then lol
ugh...my typing sucks
Praise the lawd
The makers of this film were some of the first trolls in the world, they deliberately made this shit trolling all the kids who were excited about it just to joke on them
