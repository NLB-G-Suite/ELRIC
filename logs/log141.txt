Someone ponify it.
DO IT
06,15Ponify everything! Leave nothing unponified!
>been leaning on left shoulder while laying down since 12pm
>just got up
>HOLY SHIT THE FUCKING PAIN
06,15Sounds painful, pony
I know that feel.
I shift too much to know that feel.
Ponify all the things....?
Ponify ALL the things!
06,15Well, name one thing that shouldn't be ponified... I dare you.
Hmmm.
06,15(ponies don't count)
The Last House on the Left.
I can think of a bunch of unmentionable things, anyway
Should NEVER be ponified.
Babes in Toyland
A-
Awww.
herospirit: THIS
06,15Babes in Toyland might have been bearable had it had ponies in it, though...
06,15....probably not, actually
Would you really put the poor ponies through that?
I could see Ponifying the plot MAYBE working. But I highly doubt it.
/me feels terrible
06,15>ponifying the plot
Ha
06,15...I apologize.
Why Nat?
06,15Not sure it's been announced yet.
...can we have a hint?
/me is taking care of a cat
06,15So I won't :P
Hi?
does it have to do with ponies?
Tell us, try to say no to THIS http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/e81c0d64f592ac63f188594d527aecdc/62885%20-%20derpy_hooves%20pony_must_lick_pony%20screwball.png
06,15screwball, is that her fanon name now?
hi :)
Yes.
06,15Makes sense.
yep...
It's on her flank....
06,15I'm guessing it's also the official name, really.
maybe
Her appearance was probably the best 2 seconds of the entire show imo, and the show is pretty damn amazing.
06,15Yeah, I loved the opening 2 episodes of this season

yo
WIN
Been ninjad again, but still WIN.
I'm going to find the most non-pony songs I can and Ponify them.
Example. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abJYXY3mPjs
Unless it's already been done.... Hmmm...
Ponify an opera song
It can be done
I've already gone through four color revisions of this damn book, herospirit
Whyyyyy
I approve of Pony Opera.
Actually pony opera's been done before
Try finding a picture of Twilight with a book
And steal the colors.
Really?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5u7so6UvRg
That's the opera I was talking about
Oh, for the YFM songs, I specifically want to ponify "My Balls" and "Orphan Tears" :P
"Batman Gambit"?
"You six ponies are Equestria's only hope!" -lets them go off as they will-
Wait.
Guuuuys. When Pony Emblem is finished you'd best play it. :I
I'm not making these portrait sprites for nuffin.

I've been devising an e-mail for my company for about an hour
It's glorious
Oh?
Then I'll work on my shirt design on Illustrator
We quadrupled our bandwidth last night
I think using "everypony" in my e-mail might not be very professional
But maybe if I use a strikeout...
yes it is...
ponies are always professional
I'mma do Fluttershy's cursors last, 'cause moving butterflies is gonna be hard.
It's the HEIGHT of professionalism. :P
someone done that before
wish that would happen for me....
I saw a rage comic where someone did that, and apparently their superior responded with "My Faithful Student..."
lol
I heard that story once.

dont stress youself luna :D
It's alright.
/me hugs luna
The mods are working on the problem, but you might want to start by asking them for the link in the #bronystate
Hey guys.
04Why thank you, Val
hi lunatheforgotton!
04As do you
2,14 :D
I mean sometime today Episode 2 should run if I´m not mistaken
BATS IN MY FACE
04Why?
thanks
04What's he gonna do, make fun of it?
It already did
darn
04People have been doing that for years
2,14 because it's one of the few things that can bring tears to my eyes :P
Oh.
04Huh, I see
nothing yet
Is there a stream right now?
It's already up
06,15FFX is probably the best FF, though I still hold some weird nostalgic attachments to FF7
damn I should get sober already^^
07,1yes there is...
/me regains consiousness
07,1just not a regular place
/me takes her jacket off
04I also enjoyed VIII
That might help
2,14 8 was awesome
06Dat jacket~
:]
06,15FF8 was great, except the draw system was too tedious
full of trolls D:
You'll get a pneumonia.
07,1this community is warm
07,1:)
06c:
Luna: BAAAAAAWWWW *tear in eye*
2,14 phfff, the draw system was easy if you did it right
=D
/me meows at Luna
2,14 just card a few mods, card refine. Boom. You're done
2,14 mobs*
/me stands back up
06PEGACORN DETECTED
06PONYPOUNCE INITIATED
06,15Easy? Yeah, but it took unnecessarily long.
07,1is it still lagging?
/me ponypounces Pegacorn~
07,1good.
04Not to mention Sephiroth
06Sephiroth is a cutie~
04Fans eat them up
2,14 Kefka > Sephiroth
06You are just jelly~
07,1we might switch again to the mane room after the movie.. but I did not want to keep you waiting
06Luna is victorious!
Luna: We are not worthy!
My stream is just not loading.
Boone is still the best
07,1Luna go here: http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=SaturdayNightLive
Yes I saw that, thanks^^
2,14 lol
CosmicChan: Refresh it.
06,15I don't like Sephiroth fanboys, but you do realize that he does a lot more than that, I hope...
np
I finally found it on YT
GET OFF OF ME vv!
again
Boone
*VV
Still Best
06,15He's just a boring character.
Thanks Luna:)
07,1your welcome
06Cid from FF7 is SOOO hot though!!! <33
2,14 whereas Kefka actually fucking DOES it
07,1we might switch back after this movie
06,15Because how well written a character is depends on how much of the planet he blows up :P
are we talking about the same things?
?
you just got teabagged :3
/me vaporizes the teabag
2,14 Well I'm just saying that since Sephiroth is such a bland character, we only have his actions to go off of
2,14 which, is pitiful
07,1Sorry guys & girls
/me Pegacorn's been teabag'd. ey?
2,14 whereas Kefka is a delightful villain :P
07,1I just got home.. from a conference
06ish tay~ :3
07,1had no idea we had tech issues...
Might I ask you if you know a good YT channel for episodes?
/me hugs Luna tightly
hey brownies
SuperBrony64,No WAY!
/me runs with arms flailing randomly
04Ah, I'm good
04Just refresh
why is the stream not loading?
right now I only found a rather choppy one
That's why Ulysses is just an awesome antagonist
I mean
07,1for now this is the best I can do
04REFRESH, I SAY
Just enhance and zoom in the stream.
Someone mentioned Kefka?
04Val did
2,14 that would be me
hey its back =D
but i just DID refresh
2,14 Kefka= Best villain
04FFX was like an experience
06,15Bjornfot, http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=SaturdayNightLive
Not really
04I experienced it
04Yeah, it really was
2,14 and since then it has only degraded
Heath Ledger is best villain.
06FFX had an epic beginning song. . .
11 had good music. <3
2,14 Espy: the universe would implode
06,15I have some issues with the American voice acting in FFX, but otherwise it's amazing
2,14 I actually really liked the VAs in 10
kk^^
04I'm like an inverse of Ermac
2,14 but then again, Bender as Wakka is rather awesome :P

Hurray for books!
/me does not tend to acknowledge things
04Like An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge and The Yellow Wallpaper
06,15I only remember the ones I've read.
RobotPinkie:…I wouldn't expect anything less...
I haven't read that book in ages.
06,15The implication that just because you haven't read one "classic" book you've read nothing else is silly.
The villain of this movie is none other than…BOO RADLEY!
just thought you'd like to know
*biff*
Yeah, I said it.
to be able to teleport myself to equestria..
the power to have my comments always be read and replied to when i want in any given chatroom
06,15Being a pony in Equestria would be my superpower.
2,14 *Cartman voice* The power to have all the powers I want
04What are you doing working in Applied Sciences?

The gun is now a stapler.
06,15I think that's when the show jumped the shark, really.
/me is getting away with Bjornfot's T.V.
06,15I mean voting in Equestria?
The first episode we see Luna in.
/me waits for people to get her reference~

this really could have made a amazing movie
should have been a made-for-tv movie
yeah this would have been a great movie
he's chaotic evil
Chaotic random perhaps
poor spike- I know that feel.
04He really should have been a supporting character that occassionaly follows Twilight around and gives comedic feedback and provides antics
I sympathise with spike.
tbh, this and look before you sleep were the worst episodes
Best part
*except
2,14 Shivering Isles was an amazing expansion

/me agrees with luna very much
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SECURE THE RAP
after all, its hard to change direction on a ballon
I agree, these two episodes should have been a movie.
shuuuuuun
2,14 and people were worried S2 wouldn't be as good :P
:D
07,1huuuug
part 1 was great, part 2 was a massive letdown
i liked this ep quite a bit.
04We won't really know until the third ep
up to this point I thought it was good
insta wingboney
04Since this was made at the end of S1
it's this part I think could do with revising.

Fight the power!
perhaps it's just rarity

Hey.
9 *mach
I was thinking,Dont you think a halloween special would be cool for the next episode?
Are we watching all of it?
9 Not NOW, but eventually
The first two seasons of this show are wonderful.
9 thismight be the last thing I stream fortonight
9 I actually have never watched Nanoha
heeeeeeeeeeeee?
AKU!
did card capture sakura rip this off?
9GRATUITUOUS ENGRISHI
Master, this came after CCSakura.
oh
It's Digimon
damn mathematics, they always muddy the issue!
Ive never watched this show ironically.
I think Card Captor Sakura came out in the mid-nineties. . ./me checks wikipedia
Yup, mid nineties.
was that probection?
spelled out?
Both the CCS manga and anime ended in 2000.
atleast she has something covering her lower half. unlike another magical girls show I can think of -cough-strikewitches-cough-
>stand by ready
Fate wears a mizugi, just saiyan
LOLWUT
eventually they'll make a magical girl anime and try and handwave away that they have to wear clothes
The world is being consumed by shitty animated shows
or movie
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This
/me trollfaces
9>Watching Nanoha for theplot and not for the BEFRIENDING
usualy 80 people and about 20 speak
her too!
Not 20 currently
Seriously, the punch to the face happens in a flashback in this show.
/me speaks
was earlier...
Only like..6-8
her hair fringe flipped!
Yup
Nanoha doesn't /actually/ need magic powers to BEFRIEND people. It's just more fun that way.
She can do it by punching people in the face.
9Yeah. They just explode twice.
People were thinking he would say "Suprise!" and just fly away somewhere
there are weirder ships in the universe
I just saw one though
They're just imaginary friends that slowly vanish as she grows up.
<3
9 Right. I forgot.
theres one!
you can see the back of his head
;):):(:'(6_9:S:[<3:|:P:D:O:$
9NANOHA, TEACHING US JAPANESE
So,Do you stream anything else?
KIHEN IS FLUTTERSHY
He's a men
Note, Nanoha never met Jail. Fate fought him, supposedly.
Everyone is just humoring her slowly disappearing delusions.
I AM A STEGOSAURUS.
When you have enough magical power to blow up moons, you're far more willing to play along with harmless things like that.
PIANO!
QUICK,SHOOT ME IN THE FACE!

I meant for myself
It was a good un.
The first Maiden was that girl in the cage.
Wako is another of the four Maidens.

THEY HAVE NO MOE
Aside from the 14-year-kid I know from Ponychan.
He's alright, but I'm 20 years old and would like someone at least a year older
Ripe for the picking
or PLUCKING
or dicking
Have it but havent watched it yet.
I have it all downloaded, but I still have only watched up to ep4.
I'd probably hang out with her if I could
But for some reason 14 feels awkward for some strange reason
Probably due to the fact that 15 is accepted as the age when one (mainly young ladies) start their road towards their adulthood in Latin American cultures
lolpedo~
but yeah
Nichijou doesn't have Penguin Chiyo.
Azumanga has charming moments of silence. Not sure if this one had them.
DAT AFRO
lol
I think it's a cultural thing
14 years are still seen as kids here, and 15 year olds are already treated like adults
lol
1 year plus or minus...
5 or 6 younger, i'd hit him anyway
it's made of random
inorite
yes, epsylacopa, i did
:I
it's like, common knowledge
Either is fine but confusion is a terrible thing for bystanders
remember when you streamed yourself?
srsly wtf is wrong with this show
he was sitting on a can?
You could have just said you were bi man D:
yesh
that must of hurt after a while
i'm not gay
you don't have to be gay to like the same sex >_>
built by a child.
bisexuality is actually very common and trendy nowadays
i don't like labeling myself, though
i'm just... sexual
i don't discriminate
ahhhhh I see
That makes sense
/me is allergic to cats.
Meow.
/me is also allergie to moe. ACHOO
/me hates cats....
men, women, transgender, hermaphrodites, ponies...
yeah labels are kind of a necessary evil
They're convenient but can lead to problems and discrimination
all ok in my book
Pansexual
>Ponies
i'm a STOP LABELING ME AND LEAVE ME ALONE
label *
Talking cat!
But I like youuu. ;_;
only FiM ponies
Also what's with that cat's face?
Let's just say you're omnisexual
i think it would be ok, to bang them, if they were real
:D
._.
Dat face
GIVE ME 10 OF THEM NAO!
unbeatable bargain!
:I
....
/me goes to the back room to check if there are more Bjornfots
that said
Scream? I dunno if you can call it that
mk
/me only has 1
darn...
It was more like....he suddenly had asthma.
We can order more
only 1 bjorn....
but, really...
because of the Empathy Effect
fuck taboo
fuck morals
fuck society
case in point: chances are we're very, very distantly related
it's not society, though. It's a species' natural progression
fuck norms
/me grabs handgun
eeenope
Not norms, but rather, a method of natural population control
/me grabs Dash's other gun
you see
/me 's gun goes "cha-chick"
/me did not think this through....
thousands of years ago
IDEA!
/me solved this with bigger triggers
more gun?
/me flys to his weapons bunker and grabs a missle
OH SHI-
/me flies above everypony holding missile
brb. Sociology lesson later
/me fires mooncannon
awww
/me is on the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
maybe...
Shoo be doo?
...on the moon
/me still has Dash's modified gun
...Substatue?
/me goes faster on the moon
It's physics
Why does she have a massive gun?
Kay
because...who doesnt carry a gun to school
she is Tsugundri
Substitiary Locomotion?
/me has massive gun
yeah right
fuck that shit...
>self-programmed
i got a missile
/me does not need such a puny weapon
beastiality is just fucking wierd....
end of discussion
LOL
I change window to irc
good argument
first thing is see
"weird"
04:37:01 < DashWithRainbows> beastiality is just fucking wierd....
/me does not care
Wat.jpg
wierd is 100% subjective
this response was brought forth by a reason: to avoid abnormalities in the gene pool, for one, and for two, to actually bring more variety to the gene pools, resulting in offsprings more fit for survival
A woman with 2 heads is normal to some.
/me flips shit
>mfw coming back to #bronystate to see MobileDCD's posts
conversation over
lawl
...how can we know any of that for sure?

I think therefore I am right
Why can animals speak?
i mean, there couldn't have been many records where they like, wrote HEY WE LIKE INCEST MKAY
I am confuzzled
pshaw
By studying population patterns, evidence, and because it's manifested in pretty much every other living creature in the planet

NI
CHI
JOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
First magic, then religion
DAAAWWWWW
AWW YEAH MAGIC
GASP
ya
Sanity is a one-trick pony, it only gives you one thing: Reality
But when you're good and crazy, the sky's the limit!
"Normal" means "that which manifests itself in the area of a graph with the highest probability of an isolated occurence"
In other words, it basically means "most common aspect"
No
sufficiently advanced technology (aka science) is indistinguishable from magic
I GOTZ A FEVER (no really it sucks) AND THE ONLY PERSCRIPTION IS MOAR PONIES
/me is tapped out of ponies
You could search for a "normal" area for an isolated characteristic, but nothing more
nichijou
I see I see
going to refresh the stream here in a moment.
/me agrees
Everybody is strange in some ways
common knowledge: "normal" does not exist and is not achievable
back up
Which episode?
3
And...."Normal" is not necessarily good, nor "abnormal" is necessarily bad.
hm
and yet, people keep calling out others saying they are not "normal"
Oh! Beautiful yet hypocritical species of mine!
yeah
we ar elike that
'meh.
if we listen to our instincts and emotions too much
dem legs
Enlightened Anarchy?
Sux to be you all of existence would say

Oops my bad
you must remember, however, that no two souls are identical, and no two viewpoints, exactly alike.
Some might believe the words of Voltaire and Rosseau, while others might dwell on the thought that we are sinister by the nature of our own conception.
THERE I SAID IT D':

And now we wait for 2 weeks.
...Right?
WELP. this is an embarrassing point to have not been using headphones
3 seems morelikly
lol
i can't tell. they're just all lumped up
oh boy Sugar Cubes again
have some more of the wrong ponies wille I go get some more ziacam
Oh hi GG
I hate how they discontinued the Pre 3 before it was even released :(
Or at least before it was released Stateside.
Really? For real?
yes
Does it say the name of the episode?
I am looking at my cable guide
hey
Uggghh…why do they need to repeat part 1 and 2 over a two week period?!
was up
It's a great two-part episode…but damn…two weeks...
hello?
:|
3 really
eh. i can live.
Here's hoping for some Christmas/Halloween specials :D
yah :D
Kinda sick of "yay" 'louder"
That would hurt…a lot
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-Tc8y3Guo&feature=related
That's to get maximum Pony.
/me has watched 202 3 times already today.
i'm downloading the ep right now actually
Awesome! On iTunes right?
i hate itunes
Uh-oh…that means you piratin'
ohgod 1080p version
tsk tsk
apple rapes artists
just donate directly
they actually get the money then
Me too.
apple takes 99.99% of the money you pay
:P
pretty much
but they would get more if you just send them a paypal or something
and bypass the middleman
I dont think they are hurting for cash if FiM brought in 5 mill last year.
lol
They got a good portion of that money from iTunes I would suspect.
in fact I am sure that is why we have S2 and 3
and viewers on the hub
I would but from Itunes if I was't limmited to I devices
apple might be ok. i don't like their products but other people can. that's cool. but itunes....is discord
Only reaision I have an I phone is cause i found one after a tech show at work.
put android on it
I've tried using a lot of other phones out on the market, but none were as good (IMO) as an iPhone.
apple products are ok. pricey for the hardware but software is just different.
Not as good, interface was much slower, scrolling wasn't as natural, and there's no guarantee of apps working on a specific phone over another.
i hate the style and how you can't mess around under the hood but that's me.
i hate win7 phones
4 background programs in my taskmanager
I've used that and it's got an interface that is near as good as the iPHone
background programs that sit in memory looking for me to connect my phone or othere moble Idevice
used to, though
3 i can close and one is only if I want to share music
I'm not saying other interfaces and apps don't work, I'm just saying it isn't as 'smooth' of an experience as I would like.
especaly when streaming.
For example, the browser on Android doesn't have the same fluidity in scrolling and zooming that Safari does on the iPhone.
The best thing I like about the iOS is the addition of iCloud in Apple's next update.
thought about jailbreaking mine but I dont want to brick it.
all i need are my contacts, dates, and whatnot
i handle files myself, since it's easy
iCloud does more with App data, Phone backup, etc. That's why I'm looking forward to it.
oh this

I do like the Android tablets though. :P
10.1*
honecomb tabs are nice
i've seen my tablet overclocked to 1.8ghz from 1ghz
<3 nvidia
bet that is a power drain.
ewwwwww x86?
IT depends if the processor is underclocked in the first place
;-;
excited to see that baby :3
I really want to get the PlayStation Vita
i only run 1.4
Haha, that sums it up.
and i get like 9 hours
since i got it all tweaked
nah mine can idle for at least a whole day
i haven't really tested it
Have to remember to turn off my wifi when I am not using it, kills my battery in like 3 hours
but like i said i've tweaked it a lot
yep
wifi burns
bluetooth
power saving profiles
task killers
I jack work networks

You should play my awesome playlist that I've been perfecting :P
not bad animation.
FFFFFFFFthis cold.
I'll just leave my playlist here in case anyone's interested: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF62EACEFD4FD1533&feature=mh_lolz
:P
Although I've never actually linked a playlist before…so hopefully that's the right link...
Oh, and my nose is bleeding now
looks like alot of the one I have seen at some point
My PL is in a fine location too =p
Well good news then! My playlist has 99% Ponies :P
dumb isp
Century Link is the current name
1 Gbps for $70 a month >:(
costly
But 1 Gbps
That's ungodly fast
Streamers :P
we pay $100 for 1.5mbit
that's just Dl speed
and have latencies 800+ on a regular basis
upload is never that fast
i'd like to host my own servers
Lol, I did?!
I'm paying $30 for 15-20 Mbps down
NorCal FTW
they are supposedly upgrading here soon for 100down
Woah. Sure is less people in here.
i have a feel that i am lagg
Noting realy going on on a saterday.
that all
I may end up emulating my namesake against two of my roommates before the weekend is over.
I see
mad*
OH LORD
I tend to do anime and Burnnotice
Hiccuping Pinkie is best Pinkie
I have the distinct feeling I'm going to end up backhanding my roommate. :/
There are many things I'll put up with, but blatant disrespect is not one of them.
oro?
Oh boy!
oh man my ears dont need this >_<
inb4 9999999999999999
uuuuhhhhhhh
He's from Alabama. Go fucking figure.
5 across the eyes
Spider_Jerusalem: Smack him with a trout
5 across the eyes? That means pimp slap?
?!?!?!?!
brrbrbrbrbrbrbbrbrrbrbr
Hmm…that was enough spam for one night.
yes backhand em or just say gtfo
no rent payed and name not on the lease
And if he keeps it up.....
just be mindfull of where you do it, dislocated a guys jaw with a knucke backhand.
*troll face*
Haha
wait, are you guys roommates? =p
No.
no I only hang here and eqd
He's my roommate. But not the bad one.
I have three roommates.
In a 2bed 2bath. :/
Force 'em all to pay rent or slap them with some trouts.
Derpy is fine.
ACtually, I'm not paying rent right now, due to being involved in legal matters against two seperate businesses.
I had a roomie that liked to go loose his pay check at the casinos before he got home.
I lose my paycheck to Ponies :/
:P
Nah, I'm just kidding...
I don't get a paycheck :(
second time I told em to gtfo
hub was't around back then.
if it was it was still discovery kids

Fluttershy is awesome!
Uh-oh, mods are here. Hide the ponies!
Anywho.
Actually…I think his client just reset :P
But nevertheless…hide the Ponies...
Can't be too careful
Tell him he's just in time for Pony videos
that is why i keep my system in my room.
Once I get a job, and sort my legal shit out, if he doesn't have a job, he's getting kicked the fuck out.
And I'll do it in the asshole way.
Spider_Jerusalem: Are you the only one on the lease?
I kind like this vid
"Approved for all ages!"
NOOOOO
Nah
Me and derpy are on the lease.
in fact I am saving it to my random list
Douchebag and his girlfriend aren't.
Derpy, huh?
Derpy from ponychan
Anywho. Douchebags girlfriend is a long time friend of mine.
And I haven't told him to GTFO yet because she'd insist on moving too. And they don't have anywhere else to go at the moment.
speaking of niconico
I do enjoy dem Ponies
Dis song
You not awesome or something?
I think it's more we play it too often
If only there was someone elses playlist we could play to end this monotomy...
=p

What's the joke?
http://www.facebook.com/BroniesCommunity/posts/253106294731527
the comment there

How about this one
he commited suaside
only spelled right
"My mate rang me and asked, "What're you doing at the moment?"
I said, "Probably failing my driving test.""
lol 2 letters off? close enough!
lol
MeteorVenture: Icwatudidthar

No hard feelings…FRIENDSHIP?

Okay. I'll share my favorites.

as per part of the deal i guess i have to post my shamelessly self-promoted channel
Nickelodeon?
Woo
Douche roommate was in the bathroom
I didn't have to fuck him up
Spider_Jerusalem: Cause he already went to the bathroom…?
Those Japanese anime girls and their skimpy outfits...
As in he was in the bathroom the entire time I was out of my room.
They make me angry.
One reason I like One Piece is they make fun of anime stereotypes
Topless? really
that's the English tey're going with
Yeah it's realy bad jinglish
*they're, dammit
The other anime I really like is Yatterman, but that went away after a season or two :/
Starring the best character names ever!
Yatterman-1 and Yatterman-2!

Can I make a couple of suggestions

Maybe Twilight could have read about humans in a history book which makes her less surprised. At the moment she takes meeting an alien very calmly
I like trains.
She doesnt know right away that he's an alien.

G1 is one of the best series from my childhood.
Dinobot's "Code of Hero" episode was wonderful.
