pony_2841: SLOWPOKE.JPG
G4 is too rushed
Not anymore. Stream just ended.
Well.
september 24th...
also there be no spelling here
So apparently AJ == Han Solo
some were worried early on, but I knew you guys would pull it out...bowchickabowwow
That WAS the re run
From what I've seen of episode 1.
2,14 lol
going on the tubes.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omhSnagjOL0
It might be up now.
DAMN
I dunno if Babes in Toyland beats A Pig's Tale for worst movie. Babes in Toyland is officially too long, though.
The Day Ponies not only defeated Discord...
you know...it should of been better when apple bloom was the cause to bring apple jack back to her honesty but again, thats just me
And Celestia makes Twilight and her friends do everything while she gives slight hints as to what should be done, all while clopping up in her tower.
G4 is Awesome you shut your whore mouth
But took over the whole internets
Thanks Turtaguin
your timing was off bro, you're an hour late
The ending to Babes was so schmultzy that if forced crying emotions
Keep and eye on EqD for youtube episode updates.
lemme recheck if they're there
If no one else is streaming, I'll stream requests I suppose.
why is it just lifestream
i mean
Clop Clop Clop
There's probably some stream replaying the whole thing somewhere.
Will Discord be back? :(
No my whore mouth is busy with surprise and licketysplit
had my doubts about season 2, but so far its awesome ^
I repeat Gurren Lagann!
Nah
Spider's Web was laughably bad, Babes in Toyland was literally painful to watch and it was TWO HOURS AND TWENTY MINUTES LONG
im going to go cook me some pizza :3
i hope to see everypony next episode, goodbye!
why cant they put up the episode like on youtube
Megas XLR
...
or somethin?
#vinyl_scratch is our request channel everyone.
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/62770 heh

Will Mark Hamil be the next major villain?
08,1xD
The site may not allow it.

Celestia counter-trolled Discord with the letter spam.

Ended predictably but not how I was hoping. lol
And his name IS Marcus.

With the windows down.
And there was no Luna at the end ;~;
YEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH!
AllisZero: can you give me an MP3 download link of this song?
the episodes ending reminds me of star wars episode 1
Markus Person
Like a boss
lol
2,14 well, as much as I'd love to stay with the most fabulous room, I'm going to get some sleep now

But I expect that's because of when the episode was made
he is leader of Mojang
If everyone will excuse me, it's time for College Football.
2,14 fare thee well bronies
Discord IS a boss
A worldwide cult.
I thought Star Wars ep 4
DashWithRainbows: Just search for Avast Fluttershy's Ass, the video has an Mp3 download in it
We should have plenty more Luna this season, i believe. >:u
Laters
haha yea
We had a Star Wars reference in an episode with a Star Trek character. I will never get over that.
even though that person left. lol
They worship the creeper.
heh
Hahaha
what a story notch
:) <-- best pony
Hopefully so
I have football and finish cleaning the garage so I'm outtie 9000 as well.
NEXT WEEK BEST ROOM!
my little creeper, explosion is magic
type in google
Sleep well, Val!
*has Luna/NMM epicface pic for my avatar on the forum I go to*
;)
I do believe the star wars reference was from episode 1 I believe
rarity?!
and i was the first to request
http://youtu.be/egl076EHmFU
It's been Luna with a tophat and monocle, but then I found a NMM one and was like HNNG xD
Oh boy... taking advice from strangers...
Star Trek Wars... I feel trolled
XD
mine craft fourms
*4
somepony said that the testiculates dont have arms
Well techinacally episode four, which was the first movie
yeah 4
the NPCs?
The ref was for episode 1
oh the have
Fluttershy is fave pony, and I <3 Luna very much, but I try to not include her in my favorites until we see what she's actually like. lol
/me takes off nerd glasses
but they do, they are tucked into thei coats
four?
because Twilight was Luke
Testi-whats?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIg8Vs-MVZA&feature=related
A New Hope
no NPCs
<3 fluttershy
derp me >_<
npcs
The villagers?
there all called testificates wight now
lol someone uploaded the Throne Room scene to KYM
right*
yes
Though the Luna vs. Microwave and the fics of the same series... That's about what I'd expect of her
the take of the hall is the biggest give
oh right
Speaking of college football, Penn State needs a better kicker!
from SW
ashleylovegood: Fluttershy ftw :D
AHAHAHA
I don't count the new movies
oh yeah
i was close enough
oh! Yeah, it's just a play on the work "test".
Fluttershy is best pony for me, Flutterbitch is best bitch
Baylor v. Rice today
you got it
etc.
#19 Baylor v. Rice, excuse me
wtf
KYM will explode with Star Ponies memes
stream getting stuck for anyone else?
how makes this livestream?
I wonder what they'll be like.
honestly when they were grey i liked rarity the most. lol
yeah
yay...
yep
Who?
yup
did I miss the episode?
if twilight is like...celestia is obi wan?
i think if you give them items
Greedy Rarity was indeed awesome
is luke*
Yep
they give you some back
eyBARK
if you attack them
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cvhGp9t2AU but it's on YouTube already
inb4 hundreds of Star Wars/Star Trek/Pony Crossovers
in other news
biggest give was the MUSIC
crap, oh well
they attack back
it's almost a direct reference
oh, ok then
something like this
cool
I'd have to go with her or Flutterbitch being my favorite reversed pony
thanks
I know someone have already did Star Wars and Space Balls pics
Think they'll expand?
ended at 10 east
who does the background music again?
yeah
I will laugh with the pony/star wars XD
hope so
naming a "diamond" tom. lolol
I wanna see something affect the landscape.
Tom is best rock
@Aponymous Don't forget Big Crown Thingy for MLP/TF2 crossovers
whoever is manager of this mainstream
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSBaaeaqHiE
Other than creeper explosions.
Tom and Rarity forever~ <3
I heard the music and I thought: OH NO THEY DIDN'T!!! XD
yeah ^^
put on flutterguy singin zakoras song
Clemson is fighting Florida State. This is going to be interesting.
we will never speak of this again!
Who needs Giant Rock when you have Tom?
Hey folks
I know that has been posted a million times
AJ: *speaks of it*
Luna is Darth Vader
lolz
DSNesmith: Daniel Ingram
please
but why did the CMC showed up there the cause of discord's breakout, that just bothered me alot
awwww yeaaaa
no Ingram does the singing songs
who does the BGM
Are there any sites replaying the episode? I wanted to avoid the rush
that might have been the best episode i have seen of anything ever quite possibly.. yes i'm entirely biased
Oh? I thought he did them all.
damn
Any idea how big we peaked here?
:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|
wrong button....
It was pretty good.
DONT TOUCH IT. FLUTTER: IM TOUCHING IT!
1600

rofl
1.6k I think was the estimate
Though time will tell its quality over the others.
youtube
watch in awe
well this certainly is...inetresting...
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3642/3386195953_f3ceaa433c.jpg this seems relevant...
Highest I saw was /almost/ 1.5k
and lying AJ's lieface was the stuff of legends
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cvhGp9t2AU
kind of
I think it was better than 201
nah but seriously it totally ripped my expectations apart and did better
so much skipping
bye guys, see you soon
Diftraku: over 1200 when i counted...
watch in awe
I'm getting some lag.

Too much hot sauce?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ABmFoAJfvo&list=FLApr22djnx7PuxbxZ_XXolg&index=2

scoots is a dodo
HOW cool was it when Celestia was sending back all those letters, and then it dawns on you, "OMFG LEARNING FROM THE STUFF SHE ALREADY LEARNED, HNNNNNG"
>:(
i wonder what age do you think the mane6 are
well anyways, cya I don't want to get spoilered
Both the audio and video are broken
or not the video, it just skips a lot
I'd guess mid-teens, around 15-17
I'm getting serious lag.
wow.....
disturbing.......
Later ponies
i would volunteer to stream with bronystate except my internets suck :(
Anyway, it's been fun everypony, but I've got homework to do :P. Later!
with Flutterwin at least a year older than Pinkie, of course. lol
so how long do you guys think before someone cuts together the ending with SW music?
Can't believe I fell for that one...
a day tops
Enjoy!
/me hugs SuperBrony64
Well, I think more 16-17
Peace~

Twilight = Luke obviously

/me is patiently waiting for his favorite part of this video
Hmm...
I see flutter as being younger and pinkie and rainbow younger
dat lag
Who'd be youngest? lol
Hm, interesting question. They all have important jobs (farming, weather management, wildlife carer (or ranger), baker etc...) yet I would put their mentality somewhere in the mid-late teens.
wow
rainbow
or pinkie
maybe
...how have i never seen these pony thread simulators before
lolwut
feat = feet
good job applebloom
Is the stream lagging, or is it Youtube?
yeah, one of those two, or somethin... lol
NO
FRAAAAAAAAANCE
Eazy-E does make everything complete
stream is lagging
just freeze framed were derpy is in the ending, her eyes!!! what happened to them, they are normal!
this animation is better than the actual show
SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
ahahahahaha SHOO BE DOO

FlutterSea Pony.
And I see Fluttershy as being a little older than everyone else, and that just making her shy factor even cuter. lol
SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
SHOO BE DOO
shooooooo beeeeeee dooooo
I'm a seapony motherfuker SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwe0daWswqc&feature=feedu
i see it as: rarity, twilight, applejack, flutter, pinkie, rainbow
Besides, when she got her cutie mark she was the only one shown as being bigger than everyone else
*nod*
but i just pulled that out of thin air
so actually, I think Fluttershy is the oldest
trippy
lol
lol

Lag is getting old.
GG that aint a ba thing
lol
The Grand Galloping Collab.

DisciePie discuss
Edward_Newgate: nope.jpg
re-watching the episode for potential memes i may have missed, so far all i got is spike=rainbow dash, and pony clones....dont think the clones are gonna catch on though
Wow that chat really has slowed down
I believe the proper name is DiscoPie
i go on things like EQD and Bronystate in class, people look at my screen and dont give a shit...
Not even
LordCelestia = Twoface Brony
Flutterbitch will be huge
family doesnt care about me much anyways
I've been saying Discie Pie since the first episode came out
Screwball better become memetic.
I can think of a few others.
perhaps tom the rock
Screwball is awesome.
I demand fanart of the new best Pony
Tom is canon, so that's awesome
Oh yeah, I can stop calling him The Rock now.
Kung Fu Rarity...
DID DOMEPONY SAY CANNON?
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/454985.html
those spike = rainbow dash pics came quick
/me prepares moon cannon
Tom^
Every time my mom comes over she laughs and asks why I still watch cartoons/
Not sure if I'm okay with that...
Aponymous: Yeah, it was getting confusing between Tom and the rock that gave her her cutie mark
yea, saw some shooped spikes already
The Spikedash pics came REALLY fast, I was shocked.
Yeah
/me says to mom "It isn't cartoons it's ponies"
lol
pinky pie singing chocolate rain came pretty fast last week
This means I need to make an alternate version of that line art I colored the other night.

It's called putting your alarm in a place you need to get up to go and turn it off.
star wars ponies, that will probably catch on fast too
That's what I do!

I thought it was called having something to look forward to.
A fanfic
Seriously

Hiya interior_gummy

Spam chat such
Pretty much everypony.
lol dat pic
:D
Rarity was quite IGNEOUS.
/me "kissed a girl and I liked it"
Veewave: Okay then
seriously, it was way too rushed, and they basically trolled us by not having luna (which was foreshadowed for the last episode a billion times), discord went down too easily. it was funny, but they sort of half-assed it just like look before you sleep
:)
07,1hey everypony
Hi
Hi
07,1how was ep 2
meh
new background GET!
Both episodes were too fast. I chalk it up to trying to put too much into 22 minutes.
This episode was written before Luna had exploded in popularity so much.
Nice
Still enjoyable though.
Yeah, I thought Discord went down too easily
So it's kind of unsurprising Luna didn't show
Still pretty good though...
still, she's the co-ruler of equestria
you'd think she'd appear
just finished watching cause I overslept, Luna -_-
@ Luna was worth the wait, i do not care what others say, it was still awesome
but it was good
07,1i might willmat some point
really good
They're saving Luna for her own episode, I'm guessing.
07,1dear god irc on ipad is ugly
I think so, yeah.
Well, the thing is, this was more 'End of season one' than 'start of Season 2'
It'd be better for her to get her own episode, too. More daw time.
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/be0b4ebff52b6074220a7be8653750f9/62830%20-%20starwars.jpg
Yeah GabeMoist

Hello~
Ohai Nat
/me waits for their glomp to end then GLOMPS HEROSPIRIT
Anyone gonna see the movies later?
Ohai LordCelestia
ohai
Horrible night last night. Four hours of half awake nightmares, and then I barfed up all the contents of my stomache.
oh my god
whyd all that happen?
Hero D:
Just sick.
:(
Still feeling ill, but a lot better than last night.
I might watch Batman Begins later, you'd have to put a gun to my head to make me watch Babes in Toyland again though. And I'd probably still take the bullet.
Lol, Aponymous XD
lol
Aponymous: I'm with this guy
herospirit did babes in toyland give you nightmares?
That :movie" was terribad
That could be part of it, LC. :P
I've never seen it myself, and I'm in good shape, so I could use a little mind warping
/me sends "get well" via telepathetic brainwaves to herosirit
I always skip the B movie unless it's a good one. Like the Evil Dead movies or any b-horror.
Or a cult classic
/me hugs Flutteryay
Flutteryay outta nowhere~
On the bright side, we can now endure any movie
/me hugs Natelyn
And suddenly, flutteryay
so how was babes in toyland
since we endured toyland
Endore Troll in Central Park
GabeMoist: Maybe. If there's anything like that again....
CriticKitten, you have no idea what you're getting into, for your soul, DON'T watch it
and WHY are there 125 people here but onyl a handfull of them are talking?
interior_gummy bad

Because this is bronystate.
run away
It's like that all the time, LC
Also herospirit, get well brah
Thanks AllisZero and Veewave
It's really that bad?

Fantastic.
Rock puns are best puns http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/041cf1512f23635c40cda33c9596d121/62844%20-%20%22YYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH%22%20Rarity_Applejack_more%20another%20bad%20get%20gonna%20jokes_probably%20meme%20pun.jpg
No, it's bad in a bad way.
It's so bad that it's so good that it's terrible again.
So eye-bleeding bad rather than "lol, oh you"
indeed
Aponymous: http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/e940851af6c3015f20584b6afcfe8454/62845%20-%20another%20applejack%20pun%20rarity%20rock%20yet.png ?

GabeMoist: YES
LOL

I would rather watch Spider's Web
alert
oh mygod
Mehpie outdid Tacowiz AND Bjornfot, I didn't think that was posssible
that
and THAT is bad
WAS FUCKIN AWESOME
W00000000T
Yes Natleyn.
I became mildly depressed because of Babes in Toyland.
And then ponies and I was fine.
Four of those already? Man, are rock jokes turning into a meme now? XD
Ponies helped a lot.
they will run out fast...
/me shrugs
I'm waiting for an Igneous joke.
epic episode
/me helps Tom set up a rock band
Ponies: They are an antidepressant, morning stimulant, medical cure for just about everything, ultimate reaction picture generator, ultimate meme generator, perfect victim of dubbin and editing, and a weapon of mass destruction.
Rarity and Tom had a bit of a rocky relationship
After that, I'll wash my hands of it.
when's the next one delayed to
?
Two weekends without no new pony
in about 2 weeks
And supposedly after that, new ponies
Hm not too bad
^Whaddaya think?
2 weeks?? WHY???
we dont know
they're repeating the discord episodes
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/b9f3f1246816fad78a862926ec3c3a29/62847%20-%20Discord%20Hustler%27s_Hallmark%20pimp%20pimp_claw%20tf2.png
Hiya Rainbow-Dash

Ohai Spike!
Hey Natleyn

/me goes on the mspa forums
Well hello there little pony
/me pokes Fluttershy` with a hoof
Lol, these star wars comments
/me twitches
"Discord Star was blown up by Twilight﻿ "sparkle" Skywalker."
/me checks the local pony thread
.....
http://s3.noelshack.com/uploads/images/8787574524663_fluttershy.jpg
Wat
wut
whut
wat is this shit?
wat
He has more too
XD
inside joke?
Arrogance killed Discord
e.g. bird for brains?
/me doesn't know what to do?
Pretty much
No, I think he's just random. XD

he didnt bother to notice they got their colors back...
his discription;
"Like that time when fluttershy was a birdcage ?"
More Star Wars? Sure, wynaut
Still I say he beat NMM by atleast 20 points
Han Solojack?
Oh wow
the scene are more similar than I thought
I can't get the birdcage picture out of my head.
HAHAHA! Apple Solo xD
Then there was Twilight looking at Spike
I need some seaponies
Another masterpiece one of the people over at the MSPA forum MlP FiM whipped up.
http://s3.noelshack.com/uploads/images/6268505416767_applejacks_hands.jpg
Yep
wat
wat
He was a lot more enjoyable villain
And the description:
Yeah
Oh God What
"This new masterpiece I call it "Applejack's hoofs are now applejacks". The story behind it is that appeljack's hoofs are now applejacks. So she can't walk now because it hurt the applejacks. That makes her unhappy."
WHAT THE HAY!? :O
wat
she was more of a Cruela De'ville villain
Wat
everyone was forced to hate her until she turned into Luna
wat
/me can now not remember the birdcage picture
The artist should be hired by Hub, no?
His plot ideas are brilliant.
no
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/f032772008c6eed8c97143ea3f7410d0/62859%20-%20tagme.png
YES
Ponibooru, y u so SLOW!
What would the plot be? Ponies on bad trips.
You know it Veewave
Okay
nevermind
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/17424738ff75462423acd39335e93f48/62858%20-%20tagme.png

Wow that was fast

Come out of Hiding Natleyn.
What do YOU have in your tabs, Natleyn?
The other one works too, I suppose.
Has Bronydome lost interest in Drawball?
Every picture I'm stalking on Ponibooru.
how is that even possible to draw something like that in like two hours :O
At least it gives me another link to bother my friend with! :D
It's John Joseco. Thats how.
Woot :P
all John Joseco does is draw ponies
Oh Joseco
Why are you awesome and obsessed awesomely
Gotta love artists like that
so hes really good at it and does it quite fast
/me listens to Pony Swag
and especially artists like that
John rolls out of bed and into his drawing chair. :l
and draws ponies
for us to enjoy
All the ponies
his bed is his drawing chair silly!
Beds tend to be uncomfortable for that sort of thing...
BUT JOHN IS PONIES!
He doesn't actually sleep, his existence is sustained by drawing.
Specifically ponies
Oh great, now he's the chuck norris of drawing

That's strange.
Definitely not what I get.

Hmm. After the things I've already searched, the first "most popular search" thing is "Twilight Sparkle rule 34".
Oh, yeah.
That was there.

Fighting is magic has an article..
RAINBOW DASH
Aponymous: Yes.
I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN I WAS SO ANXIOUS FOR THAT.
Why'd you have to remind me D:
Oops
Lol
I wanna beat ponies with other ponies already! D:
That game will be so cash, I hope Spike is in it.
They've confirmed there will be at least one non pony character.
If it's not Spike, it better be Discord, if not him...
That comparison video betwen star wars and pony wars is blowing my mind
I murder them all.
I didn't think it's that accurate
:3

Aponymous, the one they confirmed can't be Discord.
We didn't know about him yet when they confirmed it P:

I like this one best.
Yeah, I figured
So.... that bumps up Spike's chances :p
I hope it's not Gilda.
Really, the only two I can imagine it being are Spike and Gilda

DO IT
FILLY.
06,15Ponify everything! Leave nothing unponified!
>been leaning on left shoulder while laying down since 12pm
>just got up
DashWithRainbows: Numb much?
>HOLY SHIT THE FUCKING PAIN
06,15Sounds painful, pony
I know that feel.
I shift too much to know that feel.
RobotPinkie knows what he/she's talking about.
06,15Well, I do love me some ponies.
Ponify all the things....?
Ugh! There's this cat named Leo that comes by everyday and taunts my cats: It's really starting to tick me off.
Ponify ALL the things!
06,15Well, name one thing that shouldn't be ponified... I dare you.
Hmmm.
06,15(ponies don't count)
Do we really need to go there, RobotPinkie
The Last House on the Left.
I can think of a bunch of unmentionable things, anyway
Should NEVER be ponified.
06,15Oh, well, I guess that's true.
Babes in Toyland
A-
Awww.
I WIN FOREVER.
herospirit: THIS
06,15Babes in Toyland might have been bearable had it had ponies in it, though...
06,15....probably not, actually
Would you really put the poor ponies through that?
I could see Ponifying the plot MAYBE working. But I highly doubt it.
/me feels terrible
06,15>ponifying the plot
RobotPinkie: Lols.
Ha
06,15...I apologize.
Why Nat?
so everypony, what's the special event next friday?
I put that in there just for you RobotPinkie. :P
Thinking of what I was thinking.
06,15Not sure it's been announced yet.
...can we have a hint?
06,15I could tell you, but then I'd have to ban you from the entire intarwebs.
/me is taking care of a cat
06,15So I won't :P
Hi?
does it have to do with ponies?
Tell us, try to say no to THIS http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/e81c0d64f592ac63f188594d527aecdc/62885%20-%20derpy_hooves%20pony_must_lick_pony%20screwball.png
Testing irc app
06,15screwball, is that her fanon name now?
hi :)
Yes.
06,15Makes sense.
yep...
It's on her flank....
saw cutie mark "her name is now Screwball"
06,15I'm guessing it's also the official name, really.
maybe
Her appearance was probably the best 2 seconds of the entire show imo, and the show is pretty damn amazing.
06,15Yeah, I loved the opening 2 episodes of this season
wow... someone has already drawn a sketch of human screwball...
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131688214986.png
Human Screwball already? I may need to give her her own folder soon at this rate.

You are worthy Natleyn.

/me brohoofs Natleyn
I'm going to find the most non-pony songs I can and Ponify them.
Example. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abJYXY3mPjs
Unless it's already been done.... Hmmm...
Nope, can't find a PMV of it.
Ponify an opera song
Soon every song will have a Pony video. Even songs from Ponies.
It can be done
I've already gone through four color revisions of this damn book, herospirit
Whyyyyy
Also I want to PMV some "Your Favorite Martian" songs.
I approve of Pony Opera.
NAAAAAAAAT :[
Actually pony opera's been done before
Try finding a picture of Twilight with a book
except it had some epic not so opera at the end
And steal the colors.
Really?
I was gonna ask if the turret song from portal counted.
Question: would Celestia's use of the scrolls count as a Batman Gambit?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5u7so6UvRg
That's the opera I was talking about
Oh, for the YFM songs, I specifically want to ponify "My Balls" and "Orphan Tears" :P
Purple`Prose: I'd say yes
'cause it supports Trollestia.
"Batman Gambit"?
"You six ponies are Equestria's only hope!" -lets them go off as they will-
A Batman gambit is a plan hinging on them doing EXACTLY what you want them to do, that could easily be destroyed if they don't. So yes, I think so. Twi could have easily ignbored the scrolls and left town.
Wait.
I'm going back to see if they started making Star Wars references earlier
I wonder if a good flamenco song PMV is possible
I recall somepony saying "I have a bad feeling about this" in one episode. And that line is in every Star Wars thing ever so.
Guuuuys. When Pony Emblem is finished you'd best play it. :I
I will play the hay outta it.
I'm not making these portrait sprites for nuffin.
Pony Emblem? Like Fire Emblem? DO WANT
/me hugs Natleyn.
Hero, I'll load that onto a flash cart so I can bring it around with me

Yesh Aponymous, it's a hack of the rom for the Fire Emblem on GBA
I joined the art team for it :D
Awesome. I didn't know there was a Pony Emblem romhack going on, I'll keep an eye out for it.
It'll probably be a long time though. They just put together the art team like a week or two ago.
I'm patient, I'm still waiting for the Samurai Jack movie.
They had a competition. I got second place, so I get to design an OC to be one of the bosses.

And... Samurai Jack movie? WHAT? :0
Test
damn mobile irc
I think its finally working
It's been in development for years, something to wrap the series up. Last I heard was two years ago they got JJ Abrahms I believe to be the producer.
Thank god

What works?
06,15lol yeah, I'm guessing a lot of people noticed the Star Wars similarity.

RobotPinkie: There are at least 3 good videos about it already

There's another one with them side by side

Thank you Aponymous :3
Rarity without eyelashes is funny lookin
she looks so wierd...
06,15Thanks <3
Apparently Twilight is Luke
Applejack is Han
Celestia is Chewie
Spike is C3-PO
i can see this being a meme

Aponymous: Not r2d2?
Hiya ValtheJean
Lol
:3
And in comes AllisZero as well
2,14 L.O
Thank you!
06,15Ohay, ValtheJean
Eh, Either or, he does fit R2 better though, come to think of it.
hey ValtheJean and AllisZero :3
Oh hai everypony
RP!
Ohai ValtheJean and Alliszero
It's glorious
Oh?
Then I'll work on my shirt design on Illustrator
Still working on this bloody book cursor.
We quadrupled our bandwidth last night
So I'm letting everyone know
I think using "everypony" in my e-mail might not be very professional
But maybe if I use a strikeout...
yes it is...
ponies are always professional
I'mma do Fluttershy's cursors last, 'cause moving butterflies is gonna be hard.
It's the HEIGHT of professionalism. :P
AllisZero: Did you start the letter with "Dear Princess Celestia..."?
Oh god
That would ACTUALLY be very funny
someone done that before
found out that their teacher was a brony
wish that would happen for me....
I saw a rage comic where someone did that, and apparently their superior responded with "My Faithful Student..."
lol
I heard that story once.
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131688421960.png
spot the animation error
Doing that NOW
GO!

DashWithRainbows: Guards are being all "Dat flank"?
the statues actually
guards become statues...
The statue guards?
Plot twist
2,14 don't blink
I figured that was it, but dat flank is funnier :3
so...no pre-show?
I'm gonna go pass out for a bit.
Head hurts, can't focus on the screen.
Bleh.

More best pony!
Because Big Mac as a dog ain't gettin' old any time soon
http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/62915
what is this? i dont even....
DashWithRainbows: The hat?
I actually didn't care much for Big Mac until he turned into a dog.
LLUL SHOULD I DO IT
Eugh, the hat thing.
it looks wierd
Dear Princess Celestia Destination Rewards,
Princess Celestia has a strikethrough
go on...
Laters
Seeya Purple
you should send that in the email
bye purple
Later PurpleProse`
Should I?
Or should I not
I'd do it, but if you're adding more stuff, I'd only do the Princess part
More stuff like?
Once might be funny and excusable, but personally I'd get annoyed and make the feeling known if there were more pony references.
finish with the "from your faithful student (strikethrough if you need to)
In a business email, anyway.
and your name
I usually crack jokes in all my emails, it's all in good fun
Oh.
Good on you, then xD
That's why I would even consider this, everyone usually thinks my emails are funny
I was gonna say don't do it, but if you usually throw jokes in, go ahead.
Due to the magic of load balancing, we now have about four times the bandwidth of before, so your web services should load smooth as butter even during times of high traffic.
Should I say "magic of friendship" and strike it through, instead of Dear Princess etc?
-shrugs-
Eh, whatever
Hi.

2,14 you know, I'm starting to dislike screwball
2,14 she's taking the rightful place of Derpy
2,14 and that is nut gut
I love this fandom's instant creativity.
I like Screwball, but she's more the discord-y wacky kind of pony that I never wanted Derpy to be, so...
No conflict imo.
Or rather, in my eyes.
I don't think I need to say anymore about Screwball than I've already said.
Welcome back, Flutterguy

I provide links when I'm not being lazy.
haha why the lazieness then? ;P
um
hello?
Is it working for anyone?
Its not working for me
-_-
Sometimes I don't feel like googling something.
Natleyn is very helpful when i need a link e.g. a pony song
I provide Links when Ganon threatens the world
My computer doesn't like to cooperate all the time, 'cause it's pretty old.
I love it, but it's slowly dying.
I provide links when ever I can
aww
That sounds just like my laptop
same here sort of...
i havent been looking up as much pony as i should have been =p
asked my dad to get me a laptop instead of a car
anypony?
Hello?
laptop will be more useful for sixth form + will conatin shitloads of pony
hello?

can you read this?
my laptop is like overflowing with pony pics right now o.O
My laptop is possessed by a demon which upon losing my battery will destroy the world.
mine would be if it wasnt a family laptop
why is that stopping you :-P
My laptop sounds like a coffee maker

thatd be useful
Vee, your laptop contains Discord? o_o

No. Not even
Alright here I gos

Hey guys
So losing your battery results in chocolate rain?
hi flutterguy =)
yes
/me fluttercheers AllisZero
Ohai Flutterguy
ok yeah it looks like no one's here :-/
JTeeth: its because my family always checks recent saves and downloads so i cant do shit,
Yay Natleyn <3
choclate rain is a good thing =D
unless i have my flash drive then i can
just be like "so? deal with it" lol
Be stealthy
they delete all my stuff and then change the password to the laptop
so why is it not playing?
Are we in the wrong room?
oh yeah that sucks
The synchtube one seems empty as well
chnage the password first
Wierd
aww that sucks =(
thats why i want to get my own laptop soon...
dunno I clicked brony state and there's people there but they aren't from rt
Chocolate rain is good, but chocolate Tidalwave is bad
that and download all pony episodes
can you get a virtual pc?
Dash, download a program called Truecrypt
Wierd
but u can surf on it then
DashWithRainbows: No flash drive? D:
Create a virtual HD for you hidden somewhere, save your things there.
Lets go find a synchtube room then
Ill go look for one and link it
Natleyn: i always have my flash drive
ohai stream
cool
Stream out of nowhere
/me doesn't have a working surfboard
Damnit Joseco
Truecrypt creates a virtual container, kinda like a Zip file, and puts a password on it with AES encryption.

ValtheJean: It's called 'Ironic'
xD

But then again, I'm bad with naming things that are ironic…and that in itself is ironic *troll face*
That's ironic
MC Doesn't know what ironic is\

SuperBrony64: Yep
04In other news, how bout dat Final Fantasy X HD release coming up on PS3?

First dumb question. Do you need Xvid to watch the streams or are there alternatives
SuperBrony64: Do you know there's a Screwball Fanfiction already?
Ghosties: What?! I never heard of such a thing.
2,14 Ghosties: WUT?
/me wants it

Derpy eyed pony from S2E2

Edward_Newgate: I thought it was DiscoPie o_o
Also no.
I'll just leave this right here: http://www.gamesradar.com/tgs-2011-woah-final-fantasy-x-hd-remake-revealed-vita-and-ps3/
No.
/me cleans his hooves of the business
I've been saying DisciePie since the day after the first episode, so it'll always be DisciePie to me
No stream is up now anyway, ey
/me is unconsious
But wow, Vita too?! Not bad.

My favorite Final Fantasy was 13.
/me slaps SuperBrony64

04FFX is definitely my favorite FF
07,1sorry for the troubles guys... I just got home... i'm still wearing my jacket...
2,14 Ghosties has good taste
/me hugs Luna
06FFIX is my favorite. . .
dont stress youself luna :D
It's alright.
/me hugs luna
The mods are working on the problem, but you might want to start by asking them for the link in the #bronystate
06Is okay Luna~ Take your time. . .
06,15I want a girl with a short skirt and a loooooooooong jacket.
Hey guys.
06And Hallo LunaTheForgotten!
Luna: It's okay, you don't need to take your jacket off on our account.
04Why thank you, Val
VioletVanilla: I'm stuck between FFVI, FFVIII and I wanna try FFIX :<
hi lunatheforgotton!
04As do you
2,14 :D
I mean sometime today Episode 2 should run if I´m not mistaken
BATS IN MY FACE
2,14 Dari must never know of my love for X
06inb4 I realize I am wearing a short skirt and a long jacket. o.o
04Why?
thanks
04What's he gonna do, make fun of it?
It already did
Violet, oh you.
darn
04People have been doing that for years
2,14 because it's one of the few things that can bring tears to my eyes :P
Check out Youtube
ValtheJean: Wynaut
Oh.
04Huh, I see
nothing yet
Is there a stream right now?
It's already up
VioletVanilla: It's okay, I'm wearing red socks…quite comfortable.
06,15FFX is probably the best FF, though I still hold some weird nostalgic attachments to FF7
damn I should get sober already^^
2,14 just play the ending theme music, and I'm like a little girl who had her dolly stolen
07,1yes there is...
Only because they are the color red…which is for FIRE
06;3 Superbrony64 that sounds lovely~
/me regains consiousness
07,1just not a regular place
/me takes her jacket off
04I also enjoyed VIII
That might help
2,14 8 was awesome
06Dat jacket~
Luna: Don't do it! The internet is a cold place!!
:]
06,15FF8 was great, except the draw system was too tedious
full of trolls D:
You'll get a pneumonia.
07,1this community is warm
07,1:)
06c:
07,1I mean ponies what more can a girl wish for
Luna: BAAAAAAWWWW *tear in eye*
2,14 phfff, the draw system was easy if you did it right
=D
/me meows at Luna
2,14 just card a few mods, card refine. Boom. You're done
2,14 mobs*
SuperBrony64: Fire socks? I'm jelly
/me stands back up
06Lava socks Natleyn, even better~ o:
ValtheJean: <3 VIII
06PEGACORN DETECTED
Lava socks... @.@
Natleyn: You bet, every step is a new degree of burns.
hey pegacorn is back =p
06PONYPOUNCE INITIATED
/me tackles Pegacorn for fun
Lava socks sound too hot.
2,14 8 is a great story. And It bothers me that everyone complains how "emo" Squall is, and yet drool over that idiot Cloud
07,1is it still lagging?
/me ponypounces Pegacorn~
not much lag
07,1good.
/me glomps pegacorn again
04Not to mention Sephiroth
06Sephiroth is a cutie~
04Fans eat them up
2,14 Kefka > Sephiroth
06You are just jelly~
07,1we might switch again to the mane room after the movie.. but I did not want to keep you waiting
Hit the #bronystate tab below your chatbox
Oh dear, a window is telling me my system doesn't support a plugin needed to play the video that is playing in the background...
2,14 What does Sephiroth do? Stabs a few Hippies
06Luna is victorious!
2,14 Kefka destroys the entire balance of the god damn world
06,15FF8 had a much better story than FF7, yeah. FF7 just had a lot more fun stuff to do in the world.
2,14 oh, and becomes god
Luna: We are not worthy!
noooo the stream froze for me D:
My stream is just not loading.
Boone is still the best
Kefka is OP
Only reason you even win is because he got bored
07,1Luna go here: http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=SaturdayNightLive
Yes I saw that, thanks^^
2,14 lol
CosmicChan: Refresh it.
06,15I don't like Sephiroth fanboys, but you do realize that he does a lot more than that, I hope...
np
I finally found it on YT
GET OFF OF ME vv!
again
Boone
*VV
Still Best
06,15He's just a boring character.
SuperBrony64 likes to talk in the third-person as well.
2,14 feh, he kills a few nobodies. the rest of the story is how god damn emo Cloud is
Thanks Luna:)
Better late than never, right?
2,14 "Oh, Imma blow up the earth" - fails miserably
07,1your welcome
06Cid from FF7 is SOOO hot though!!! <33
2,14 whereas Kefka actually fucking DOES it
nooo chrome froze
07,1we might switch back after this movie
07,1just so you know
06,15Because how well written a character is depends on how much of the planet he blows up :P
/me grabs a wet teabag and throws it a Pegacorn "you know what just happened to you...?"
are we talking about the same things?
?
you just got teabagged :3
/me vaporizes the teabag
2,14 Well I'm just saying that since Sephiroth is such a bland character, we only have his actions to go off of
SPOILER: Someone in this movie becomes Batman.
2,14 which, is pitiful
07,1Sorry guys & girls
/me Pegacorn's been teabag'd. ey?
04Is the stream frozen for anybody else?
2,14 whereas Kefka is a delightful villain :P
07,1I just got home.. from a conference
06ish tay~ :3
07,1had no idea we had tech issues...
Might I ask you if you know a good YT channel for episodes?
/me hugs Luna tightly
SPOILER: Batman dresses as a bat
hey brownies
SuperBrony64,No WAY!
/me runs with arms flailing randomly
04Ah, I'm good
ghosties: me
06,15Well, he DOES become god at the end, too, that's kind of a common thing in Final Fantasy :P
04Just refresh
why is the stream not loading?
right now I only found a rather choppy one
That's why Ulysses is just an awesome antagonist
07,1we will switch back after batman most likely
I mean
07,1for now this is the best I can do
04REFRESH, I SAY
Just enhance and zoom in the stream.
Someone mentioned Kefka?
04Val did
2,14 that would be me
hey its back =D
but i just DID refresh
06And your best is all that we expect. :)
2,14 Kefka= Best villain
06,15I do think FFX has a much better story, though
04FFX was like an experience
What would happen if Kefka and The Joker met?
06,15Bjornfot, http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=SaturdayNightLive
04I didn't just play the game
Not really
04I experienced it
2,14 FFX was the highpoint of Final Fantasy games
ghosties: invent an autorefresher D:
04Yeah, it really was
2,14 and since then it has only degraded
Heath Ledger is best villain.
He goes and attempt to launch a Nuclear Missile at the Long-15 to take down the NCR and to get pay back at The Courier
06FFX had an epic beginning song. . .
11 had good music. <3
2,14 Espy: the universe would implode
04I'm only one ghost, CosmicChan :O
nope
/me brohoofs SuperBrony64
Ghosties: But yet your name is pluralized....
The mods might help in the main chat
04Don't let the name fool you
^ what he said
Ulysses is Best Villan ValtheJean
06,15Biggest FF game ever, pretty much.
2,14 I actually really liked the VAs in 10
kk^^
04I'm like an inverse of Ermac
2,14 but then again, Bender as Wakka is rather awesome :P
/me brohoofs LunaTheForgotten back
lol i have no idea whats being discussed as i have never played final fantasy :D
04Whereas he is multiple people in one body with one name, I am simply one ghost with a pluralized name
When is the stream going to start?
06yfw I can perform music from every FF game~
Bjornfot is back?
07,1Stonegaze
YAY
ok its laggy for me, time to play pokemons ant wait for it to be fixed, and talk in irc ^^
Ghosties: Then…you are the essence of pure evil?
2,14 Violet: RECORD IT FILLY
sup
07,1stream is up at: http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=SaturdayNightLive
04How do you figure?
CosmicChan: what pokemon you playing....
I can perform the original music from all Fallout games
/me already recorded Terra's Theme.
finishing black =p
2,14 <3 Terra's theme
then playin emerald ^^
i has black but i need to find my DS charger
Ghosties: I don't know…took me years of research to figure it out.
I wish I had a butler like Alfred.
2,14 I'm actually really glad for this FFX remake though
Ghosties: http://www.atom.com/blog/files/2009/10/ghost.jpg
i love you right now CosmicChan as that is my favourite pokemon game
04Nah, it's not me. It's some other ghost or something
06,15I need to get FF6 for the GBA
2,14 because my FFX disc is broken, so now I can just buy the remade version
it was my first one =3
GabeMoist: OMG Rarity's Ghost!!
still my fav as well =D
06,15I hope the FFX HD version isn't just on PSN :(
2,14 and your worst is still better than my best :(
just needs to be redone like soul silver was but include stuff from black e.g. your pokemon moves during battle
Why the stream isn't being shown here on BronyState?
06,15That would piss me off so much...
Ulysses, Still Best Villain EVAR
/me took a minute to learn Otherworld from FFX
04It's gonna be on both Vita and PS3
RobotPinkie: Actually, it's PS3/Vita Exclusive.
04So I imagine it's gonna be disck
2,14 the hell is Vita?
i bet they will remake emerald for 3ds =3
06I just did it for you Val~
07,1We are looking into that stonegaze
@ Stonegaze because it was really laggy
2,14 <3 violet
07,1this was the best we could do for the moment
ValtheJean: Dear God…The Playstation Vita...
06,15Doesn't really mean it'll be on disc, but we'll see
/me has no idea what that is
@ CosmicChan i wouldnt like it on 3DS
06,15I sincerely hope so
04That is true...it may only be digital like RE4 was
ValtheJean: :(
would be pretty bad, as alot of users get headaches
does anyone of you have acces to the website?
Don't do it Bruce!
aww, i dont mind the 3d on it
you could just replace the iframe yaknow
got mine first day havent had a hedache, but i know some people do
yep lets justt walk down a dark alleyway
might be rapists you know
Bruce gets his parents killed!:O
2,14 I hope it isn't digital....I only have a 20 gig PS3...and I've only got about 200 MBs left
IT BEGINS
06,15Ouch
04Then delete stuffs :P
2,14 you mean my saves?
I hate this part :(
06,15I have a 250GB PS3, though
Bruce is winning
04Yesh
MY PARENTS ARE DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAD
2,14 it literally is only game saves
2,14 all games I play =/
RobotPinkie, I am jelly.
04Then delete whatever else is filling up your storage
ValtheJean: Buy a larger hard drive for like $50-60
2,14 it's ONLY games
> has xbox 360 20gb hard drive
04Huh
04Well
04You're doomed
/me reaches for his trident

Took him for granite
I thought Rarity said that we weren't to speak of that again?
04DO HO HO
Tom will always be a diamond to us.
that slaps me on the knee!
04Tom is diamond in viewer's eyes
not mine...
04Get out
i dont have eyes
06,15He was a rock that you could lean on.
because im a sandvich
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
04Man, this chat is too punny
Well, a giant rock /was/ her destiny
/me has got a gun (nobody move)
/me moves
/me does not move.
/me moves freely
*bang
04Lol, umad bro?
Best part was when Twilight bashed through the wall with Tom.
04HERE COMES TOM
/me is a terrible shot
/me transforms back into a Pegasus
04I was like "Fuck yeah, Tom!"
Crap, wrong stream

04Wrong stream?
This works: http://www.veemi.com/embed.php?v=SaturdayNightLive&vw=700&vh=585

/me is unamused
inb4 Jackie Chan reference

"A long time ago in Equestria far, far away…"
/me puts on hazmat suit
Best comment ever.
/me offers a trade for Bjornfot's jacket
/me loves hugs~ She hugs Revolver back!
/me hugs Natleyn "there there, you be alright"
Jacket?
04Fool?
MU~~~RDER?
04I would say Tom Foolery...but then I thought Tom Sawyer
This guy sounds so familiar...
04And, well, Tom Sawyer is a badass song
Did he play in Star Wars?
You mean Qui Gon?
06,15Tom Foolery sounds like the poor man's Sean Connery
2,14 he's qui gon
Of course he does
Oh damn, lol, that makes sense now the jokes from yesterday.
04Ra's is like an inverse Qui Gon Jin
04Ironic, considering Neeson plays both
/me hugs DashWithRainbows
Ghosties: Quite literally.
06Ololol~
Stop being stupid, nose. u.u
Chat sure has slowed down.

I'm hungry for Carbs...
MEGATRON IS BEST PONY
Discord is best pony

MEGATRON IS BEST SINGER
/me brohoofs DashWithRainbows
Ballet buffalo is best buffalo.
/me brohoofs back
The_Si: Have you seen Screwball's Fanfiction?
06,15How can you fight criminals without killing indiscriminately?
No.
06,15Silly Bruce.
It's somewhere recent on Ponibooru.
Silly Bruce, bats are tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala.
04Oh, look, it's hanging cotton mouth
Ghosties: Discord? *troll face*
04Except Discord's is a goatee
04Which is perfectly fine
04This guy has hanging hair at the mouth
04At the sides of the mouth
/me becomes an executioner
04Wait, wait
04Is the cotten mouth Ra's?
Ghosties: Therefore he must be eating cotton, why so much hate for cotton eaters?
04I though Neeson was?
My brother in-law's father has a moustache like that.
2,14 nope
2,14 Neeson just takes his name
2,14 Raz really is chinese guy
04Well
04It looks like Ra's is dead
/me must destroy Gotham
04Chinese man go bye bye
Ghosties: Quite literally.

06,15I c wut u did thar

04In the depression?
No LunaTheForgotten.Kick-Ass is Kick-Ass.
04Not the Great Depression, I assume
Can't say that I've seen that movie.
RobotPinkie: Quite literally.
06,15You're going to say that to everything, aren't you? :P
RobotPinkie: Quite literally.
2,14 huh
2,14 never caught that
I'm MC_Doesn't-Know-What-Literal-Means
2,14 Mr. Sazh
04Oh shit

Oh come on, some of you must get the reference
Bruce Wayne is best Billionaire
04nope.jpg

04My post directed at SuperBrony64's
o
/me throws Ghosties copy of 'To Kill a Mockingbird'
SSSSSSsssssssssssssssssssss
04OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
04That book
04Good story...completely forgot about it
06,15We're not that cultured, geez.
GABE IS CREEPER
Ohhhhhhh, I get it know,SuperBrony64
*now*
/me is now very sad for this chat
Bruce Wayne stumbled across a cave filled with Batmans
04Bah, don't worry Val
06,15lawl
04I still remember classics
TheStartled Batmans flew around him
Hurray for books!
Then he became Batmanman
/me does not tend to acknowledge things
04Like An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge and The Yellow Wallpaper
06,15I only remember the ones I've read.
RobotPinkie:…I wouldn't expect anything less...
I haven't read that book in ages.
06,15The implication that just because you haven't read one "classic" book you've read nothing else is silly.
The villain of this movie is none other than…BOO RADLEY!
/me is not the goddamn Batman
just thought you'd like to know
/me Bat-punches Veewave
06,15I was SURE you were the goddamn Batman, though.
*biff*
Hey guys,if you could have any super power, what would it be?
Transform into a Pegasus.
Yeah, I said it.
to be able to teleport myself to equestria..
mines better :3
04Why hello thar, God
the power to have my comments always be read and replied to when i want in any given chatroom
06,15Being a pony in Equestria would be my superpower.
/me would want electric powers
2,14 *Cartman voice* The power to have all the powers I want
DashWithRainbows: We'll work together.
04What are you doing working in Applied Sciences?
06,15...that's a super power, right?
see the usefulness?
The powers of Hiro Nakamuro from heroes.
ValtheJean: YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT POWER! I'm the freakin' DM here!
Transformation into a pegasus pony. :0
/me has the same power as ValtheJan
I would have the ability to travel between dimensions
06,15The power to roast people in the belly of a dragon.
*ValtheJean
Ouch
I feel…violated.
I would tear open a portal to Eqvestria
lol now i'm wondering if anyone actually did read my comment o.o
I changed my mind; I wanna be able to be ValtheJean
2,14 :P
GabeMoist: The German version of Equestria? Your wish is my command.
Photo Finish's homeland
/me hugs MeteorVenture
06,15Actually no, the power to teleport every single blu ray set of seasons 1-230 of MLP:FiM from the future to my living room.
^This
Spray painting a black suit black...
/me is thankful
Good one RobotPinkie.
friiiiiiiends
04Bad move, Robot. Everyone knows FiM goes downhill after Season 198
06,15Well yeah, but I'm a collector, Ghosties :P
04I see
This is where I came in last night.
2,14 Now now Ghosties, you can't forget that classic episode with Caramel saving the worled in Season 213, everyone said it was the best episode ever
.....Wait a minute.Where did Bjornfot go?
2,14 world* even
04Really?
RobotPinkie: Your wish is my command, except they don't come out till they create a new Region lock that will only play on Blu-Ray players located in United States of Russia.
/me killed Bjornfot
no ValtheJean, it sucked
06,15Darn...
04I remember people calling Caramel coming in as a poorly implemented excuse for a deus ex machina
Episode 23 of season 219 was the best ep
04And Dari was very adamant against it
VEEWAVE YOU BASTARD!
2,14 yeah, but no one complained because everyone loved Caramel so much that they voted he become the new Celestia
The gun is now a stapler.
am i the only one who still likes season 42? :C
GabeMoist: That was the one where Spike finally gets Rarity as his girlfriend. Good episode.
BJORNFOT YOU'RE NOT DEAD!
06,15I think that's when the show jumped the shark, really.
YAY!
/me is getting away with Bjornfot's T.V.
What about the 2 parter where Granny Smith took on the Smooze horde?
06,15I mean voting in Equestria?
I like season 23 episode 18. It's a classic.
/me is so confused~
/me is goin' ghost
nah pegacorn, only half dead
/me shoots Veewave in the head with The Ambassador
No, ValtheJean, that's the episode where he gets killed
06MOSTLY dead, but not all dead~
RobotPinkie: No voting in Equestria. Princess Celestia makes any and all decisions alone.
The first episode we see Luna in.
/me waits for people to get her reference~
fuck the trident
/me can't bother to be killed right now please try again later
06,15I know, SuperBrony64, that's why the voting in of Caramel as the new ruler was a bit too much for me.
dat wing boner
2,14 but that's what began the great Revolutionary War of Equestria
and Caramel got killed by both sides
2,14 where soon freedom, equality, and muffins were given to ponies of all sides
I wish I could use that material to make a new and improved Rainbow Dash costume.
2,14 don't make me ban you revolver
S105E14 was awesome, when Rainbow Dash finally came out as a fillyfooler
Bjornfot,I NEED ANWSERS.
06,15All we are saaaaaying.... is give Caramel a chaaaaance
Bjornfot: lol
Oh boy!
uh oh...
Yay videos!
ummm, yes, pegacorn?
Ponies and Scrubs.AWESOME
The there was season 45 which had 30 eps
Gotta go guys
Bye
04See ya, Luna
Bjornfot, you're dead

i look around and what do i see? a great friend coming to greet me.. i look straight ahead and give my dog a bone.. i'll always be FOREVER ALONE
........
Bjornfot,just tell me the truth.
no, it was actually pretty lame
RobotPinkie: If that wasn't a troll comment if I ever did see one :P
/me mounts Pegacorn
so i'm not gonna tell it again
:D
...AND NOPONY ELSE WILL TELL HIM
>made that up >had to say it
06,15You've never seen me make a troll comment before, SuperBrony64? :P
RobotPinkie: Quite literally.
*troll face*
You keep using that word. I do not think you know what it means.
Inconceivable!

Oh, right. This is the European stream?
That stands, quite literally, for "be right back". I coined the phrase and acronym itself.
yes Crickettwb
I just came on. Is it just me or is the stream still a bit choppy?
/me is unaffected and leaves Bjornfot to figure out why
RobotPinkie: Quite adamantly.

hey guys look! i found secret butt fun at the vet http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4599956544_b26cae2951.jpg
these custom ponies look awesome
OMG
I don't think I was made to work with vector graphics
@ Pegacorn i used to but the disc broke :(
MeteorVenture: Haha
equestriadaily
Why not Allis?
I have L4D2 on Steam.
i found it by searching "give a dog a loan" in google images
....
had it on xbox, all DLC. completly love the game
not very many related jokes popped up surprisingly
having all the chats spread out like this for movie night is weird
I don't get why they think Batman is the villain...
Not sure Nat, it just feels clunky to use
Of course it's because I don't know how to use it yet
Ahh.
hey Silvermane
had a quick look round and people are spread out, most of the theatres are a bit quieter than htis
But never really managed to work well with it
Bluh, umad?
no, just confused, i'm used to things being pretty lively in here so it's weird that people are spread oout
Go to the main chat.
Ohai Allis
(unless there isn't actually a move on tonight)
what's the channel for main chat?
The #bronystate tab
#bronystate
I gotta get me one of those
/me wins
Hey Pega
:P
>took his time
How's it going/ Haven't seen you in a while
SILVERMANE!
SuperBrony64: They don't. But vigilantes, especially ones who damage property and such, are generally frowned on
XD
/me glomps
dude who just directed me to main chat: thanks, was so confused there
/me is still riding Pegacorn

So where is the stream at now?
Gonna play Gmod.Seeya all later!

Ohai Combustible
It's on
06bye Pegacorn~
Combustiblelemons: Nope, still going.
04If you had your pick, what should I get. Force Unleashed 1 or Force Unleashed 2? Keep in mind that I've already beaten the first one.
Later Pegacorn
/me hands Veewave a large tuna instead
Force unleashed 2
bye Pegacorn !!!
/me hugs Pegacorn goodbye
You just said you beaten the first one, so why get it again?
06,15Second one if you've already beaten the first, I guess.
04Because I've heard the second one is much worse
/me can't lift that unreasonably-sized tuna
06,15First one is better, yeah.
I'd get Super Mario Galaxy 2 instead.
have we picked a movie yet?
06,15Not sure why it's only a choice between those games, though, can't you get something else?
04So what say the chat?
Yeah, but why waste money? Get the second one and see how it is for yourself!
Ghosties: Super Mario Galaxy 2
04I could get something else, but I kinda had my mind on those two. Also, I don't have a Wii
good, the wii is dead
Ghosties: Then we know the answer to this debate...
Combustiblelemons: For next BMN?
yeah
06,15What format are they for, Ghosties?
Incredibles and...
uhh.
/me loads LordCelestia's mooncannon and aims at DashWithRainbows (Via con dios)
Get red faction =p
That was my pick.
I'mokaywiththis.jpg
07,1thanks violet
Ghosties: What system do you have?
Veewave: im already on the moon biatch
Call of the Cutie and something else are ponies.
04360 as of now
Mounties
06,15I hear the biggest problem with Force Unleashed 2 is that it's very short
I put the large tuna in the cannon
Get Halo Combat Anniversary :P Ghosties
beyetch
i can fly in space = easily dodge
/me is not a fan of Halo
RobotPinkie the first one wasn't that long either.

/me enjoyed it. . .
It was worse than Babes in Toyland
Can't wait for Babes in Toyland after this!
Oh wow

06Natleyn.
Natleyn: Our minds are in sync
06NOTHING
At the end it seemed they were like "lets get this over with".

A little bit.
/me is as bad as Babes in Toyland

06I need a hero
Overall, I liked the ep
And just think, eps 201 and 202 were made at the end of last years eps. just think how much better 203 will be with the upgraded hardware they got over the break.
06I am holding out for a hero till the morning liiight
/me is trying the same
Yay Batman. :3
07,1Soon over

The train was the REAL hero in this movie.

Sleazy businessman is pwned by business tactics. Irony is wonderful

06Gordon from Batman = Gordon Freeman
06;D
06,15What DashWithRainbows said.
Even if Morgan freeman was the villian, he'd still be the hero
06,15much like Tim Curry
gabe: wanted
06Tim Curry <3
get used to me being better than things you liek, Revolver.
Wait... wait, is Babes in Toyland next?
even if Morgan Freeman was a character that died in the 1st minute he would still be the hero
it's soon
When he died at the end of wanted I was sad D:
06,15Tim Curry has the best name ever, pretty much
swarm of the century is first
06,15I love indian food, so I just get the urge to lick him
Even if Morgan Freeman never appeared, he'd still be the hero
Hero, check yer pms

I DIDN'T ENJOY THE B MOVIE.
FOR THE LOVE OF CELESTIA
it was the worst night ever
NOT AGAIN
me...
^
04We won't be showing Babes in Toyland, thanks to the Worst Movie Clause
woot!
thankyou.
THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!
04However
04However
Hurray!
06HOWEVER
oh god...
Aw, pity. :p
even worse than spiders web?
06AS PUNISHMENT
04There IS the Disney version
D:
Oh dear...
06GHOSTIES WILL DO A DANCE
06ON CAM
Wait what?!
04And it was made some time in the 60's
06FOR EVERYPON
Wait, who suggested BiTL?
OH GOD WHY
04So
OOooooooooooo
Oh that good one.
04Question
A dance
04Would you guys rather see that Babes In Toyland instead?
do eet
06;3
07,1We would like your input
oh dear i think my cold is acting up again.
How about we just watch "The Santa Clause"
no ghosties
Whoever chose Babes in Toyland should win an award
He defeated Bronystate
i wasn't here for that yesterday
Ghosties: I'm all for Disney version.
herospirit: This
2,14 let's make this clear: the decision is show the new one, or NOTHING. You aren't picking between this one and the one we showed last night
There should be a rule on B movies
i wanna see what all teh fuzz is about
NO CHANCES
07,1there is from now on
o
a b movie must be somewhat watchable.
How about i show appleseed luna =p
I'm fine with no movie.
y
06Either the Disney version, or no second movie.
why not?
Oh, well, how about Nothing and we just stream requests?
04We're never showing the remake
04Ever
04Never again
2,14 because it's so god damn awful
don't you have it or something?
2,14 it is physically painful to watch
07,1Alright no B movie
but i wanna see it
04So it's either the Disney version or PMVsx
/me deleted it off the hardrive of the person she downloaded it from.
i missed it yesterday
04*PMVs
Let's do eet
PMV!!!
No you don't Bjornfot
PMVs.
PMVs!
07,1and no... we still have the pony eps left
yea
No question about it.
07,1including season 2 ep 2
06,15:O
Ghosties: that was a bit idiotic asking between Toyland and PMV's wasn't it?
06,15omg
what dash said.
aww come on mods, y u so flankhurt
04We felt the chat was the better entity to make the decision
it couldn't hav been THAT bad
ugh
IT WAS,
way too colorful in here
04Bjornfot, it was so bad it was bad
prove it
So was Lisa dead all along?
2,14 bjorn, you're welcome to watch it on your own time
IT WAS THAT BAD AND WORSE.
/me is a happy pony without Babes in Toyland
2,14 but the decision was made last night
it was worse than spiders web.
2,14 and we're sticking with it
06,15It could, Bjornfot, just download it and watch it.
it truely was.
Bjornfot: I became depressed for the length of that movie
or are you gonna force me to download it and watch it by myself?
04So, PMVs I guess
The Disney version is up on YouTube
Ah well.
2,14 we aren't forcing you to do anything
yep, sorry bjorn.
2,14 if you download that atrocity, it's your own damn fault
hi derpy
for your own safety, don't watch it
well i simply must see what allt eh fuzz is about
I've never seen it and likely never will, so no loss there. xD
and how i can beat it
I stopped watching it because it was 4am and I didn't want to miss MLP.
/me watches ninjas
lol
06,15No it's not "so bad it's funny" or something, Bjornfot, it's just bad
Veewave: impossible
no one can see them
04It's so bad it's bad
/me is not impossible
i still don't like that i'm not teh most hated anymore
So the B movie rule is it can't be so bad it's bad.
04There is no good
i thought G1 MLP was unbeatable
06,15Haha, lawl
2,14 hah
2,14 I would GLADLY watch G1 over it
g1 mlp wasn't as bad.
2,14 I would gladly watch G3.5 OVER IT
06,15inb4 Bjornfot wins B movie in two weeks time
nowhere near as bad.
but next time you better prepare your anuses for G3.5
2,14 THAT'S HOW BAD IT IS
G1 had the Smooze.
04Okay, for one, Babes was 2 hours and 20 minutes long
I'm with ValtheJean on this
04SERIOUSLY
This had...
07,1Alright BRONIES we are switching back
IT WAS LIKE LORD OF THE RINGS, EXCEPT BAD
IT JUST KEPT GOING
AND THEN WE THOUGHT IT ENDED
BUT CD2
Lmfao XD
D:
07,1the stream will go down now
I'll watch Spider's Web, G1, G3.5 simultaneously while reading spiderses over it
lol
What Gabe said.
04I pleaded for the movie to stop
2,14 hell, I'd rather read a clopfic staring Caramel over it
CD2 = Despair Event Horizion.
04I've never asked for that
It's true
2,14 and I'm dead fucking serious
06ohmy~
/me is distracted
06Val would clop to Caramel o:
we can fix that, valthejean
...by ninjas
It was like watching a car crash in slow motion
So bad, it got deleted from Fanfiction.net
06THIS IS CANON
Bashing that!
you wanted to look away but couldn't.
who wouldn't?
Just to see the disgrace in the chatroom made my night
06,15*slow clop*
/me hugs VioletVanilla
clop clop clop
That movie was like watching paint dry.
/me has the logs of it.
Except the paint was vomit.
I wonder if the makers of that movie commited mass suicide afterwards.
07,1and we're back up
06,15Watching paint dry is infinitely more entertaining.
dude...
I'd rather wtahc Manos
paint trying is so INTENSE!!
But RobotPinkie
drying*
ha, forgot i even had this window open. then, suddenly, derpy out of nowhere
06,15Manos is hilariously bad
At least Manos has Torgo
There is NO METAPHOR capable of describing the AWFUL.
07,1http://www.bronystate.net/theatre
06,15Indeed, GabeMoist, and his goddamn KNEES
He has his own walking theme
hey, where did pegacorn go? i'm alive now...
Have we seen kill bill in here yet?
It's so awful.
he left Bjornfot quite a while back
D:
If aliens watch a movie from our planet, I pray to god the first they see isn't babes in toyland.
I wonder if Nostalgia Critic would watch it?
I NEED MY PONYCEPTION FIX
06Went to play Garrys Mod Bjornfot
brb clopfics
I think the aliens would burn our cities to the ground and burn them again.
manos the hands of fate?
brb

07,1hey TheMaster
evening master
Hey TheMaster
Eeyup.
Why do I love everything about this show?
Ohai Master
bonjour TheMaster
2,14 lol...I love that Carrot Top voice
because ponies.
I was just thinking how much I like the sound of the walking.
The sound of the fucking WALKING.
ValtheJean: <3
you know, its actually within themasters character to watch something like mlp
Mah boi
DINNER
Carrot Top, too. <3
gabe: herdmind
2,14 Pinkie needs all of that excess sugar in order to violate the laws of physics
These treats are what ALL true warriors strive fooor!
i need some of dat sugar now
=p
Breaking the 4th wall is not easy
Oh hey what's going on in this thre-
oh.
ValtheJean: To power a drill MC Pee Pants has created
DINNER.
/me marvels at Pinkiepie's cake eating skittles
I'd wash your hair if I were you, Fluttershy.
/me want
other than fluttershy?
with all these sci-fi references lately. I wonder if we'll get more trek/star wars stuff in later eps
Pinkie knows.
or maybe even battle star galactica
She knows all.
super brony: did u just make AHF refrence? =p
cylon ponies
bbrrrrrrrr
ATHF*
dat wig size
Too bad all the younger generation watching the show will be like "LOL wat is star wars??"
Hard to say TheMaster, keep in mind 201 and 202 were made at the end of last years eps.
Dash is not amused.
GENTLEMENTLEMEN
A little 18th century if you ask me.
That just makes it all the more obvious the writers are total nerds
CosmicChan: Quite literally.
Eat them. EAT THEM.
And Ladies.
@ SuperBrony64 younger gen watching MLP FiM? your such a silly filly!
I PRESENT THE TWILIGHT SPARKLE COLOR THEME CURSOR SET
YOU MUST EAT THE PARASPRITES.
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20458213/Pony%20Cursors/Twilight%27s%20CS%20Themed%20Cursors.zip
Pinkie knows how to deal with trolls.
DashWithRainbows: You're right, what was I thinking? This is an adult show.
natleyn, you win an internet
troll the trolls
I think the new hope reference was great, any adults watching with their kids would have lol'd
lol spike
No Mac, I don't want a report on me force quitting Google Chrome...
like the beatles ppg episodes
pro trolls.
the parasprites a gremlins
Natleyn: YEEEEES.
Rainbow Dash's Mansion
Also, which pony should I do next out of the mane six?
Dash has an awesome house.
Has a mansion
she probably built it herself, she can control clouds
Sleeps outside
Makes me wonder what other massive references that Season 2 will have in store for us.
Rainbow dash =3
Her bikini zone!
They started off with Q and Star Wars.
07,1ewwww
natleyn: rainbow dash! =D
maybe a lotr reference
I see.
or my favorite, a dr.who reference
also did you make those cursors? =o
benny hill shows they're familiar with some british culture
CosmicChan: Yeah.
I'd suggest Jack Harkness pony
natleyn: i love you so freaking much right now
A pony hitting on Rarity and Big mac at the same time :P
^
Captain Jack Harness

oh, i'd love to see a 2001: a space oddessy reference
less dramatic
07,1fling spring marathon :o
inb4pinkie'ssuperfastgoingbackwards
Oh boy! I didn't know we were watching a marathon.
maybe a magical robot HAL "I can't let you do that Twilight"
Perhaps a "it's full of stars"
well take care fellows i got to log off

/me hugs MeteorVenture goodnight

06,15Always ruining it for Pinkie Pie... those damn ponies...
;_;
04Oh my god, StarsFull from Civ III. So good
what about civ3?
seriously Twilight Sparkle has a spell for anything = Over-powered much?
most of her spells don't work
still knows them...
still over powered
well she is like, the most talented magical pony bar celestia/luna
what if they started eating them? D:
Your Twilight Sparkle cursor set is missing a "Working in Background" cursor.
Discord would be proud.
well, they didn't eat their crops.
No Parasprite
HOW.... WHAT...
You are the words
what these ponies need is some Klingons. Parapsirtes hate klingons
/me could really go for some words right now
/me seconded
Who did the Twilight Sparkle animated cursor icons?
inb4 Twilight snap
Natleyn did....
twi finally snapped...
induring twilight snap
/me raises a hoof
Yo, Natleyn, your cursor set be missing the "Working in Background" cursor.
best poka ever
07,1Poor Twi
Pinkie Polka time!
I use the same loading cursor for both.
=D
pied piper. I see what you did there ^_^
Dat face
Celestia "what the fuck?"
lol love this part
"Hit much traffic?"
In general, most people don't need to differentiate between the two, EspyLacopa, but I could work on one.
Celestia seems to always have her wings flaired
Is it basically just an animated gif style image?
because shes a bawws
Constant wing boner?
/me cracks open the GIMP.
EspyLacopa: Yeah, pretty much.
Not sure if that'd work, but if it does, lemme know
Oh right how is the cursor set coming along?
07,1Also
07,1as of next week
/me is so proud of Twilight
Twi's done.

We could control Twilight completely by writing her instructional books. :I
OOOoooOOOOooooo

In the future, there will be 500 TV Channels…but with nothing to watch

hiya Pegacorn
Woot! Pegacorn is back!
07,1you missed good news!
Good news?
07,1yes..
yes Good news everyone!
Ya know, i've always thought that this episode really documented how messed up Twilight. Who in their right mind carries on an entire slumber party step by step from a book???
lol dash, i totally just read that with farnsworths voice
She's so deprived.....
thats the point :D
i done it while typing it
Crickettwb: Definitely a Pony who hasn't had many friends, like Twillight.
xD
nope
anyone here play osu?
fun, fun, fun.
07,1so much fun!
inb4 it is on
07,1it is on!
inb4 total warfare.

GOOD NEWS EVERYONE I'M A HORSE'S BUTT

Rarity vs starscream anyone?
07,1you are?
watch out, feathers!!
Bad news nopony!
.......Bjornfot is yet again gone.
WHY AM I ALWAYS LATE?
=o
Still looks more like pillow warfare to me
he said he is alive btw Pegacorn
Call of pillow
call of pony 4 pillow warfare?
but we told him you were playing GMod
Twilight has a lot of pillows...
Lemons/CosmicChan; I'd buy it :P
So, is there going to be a Princess Luna cursor set?
you can never have enough pillows
...Where DOES she keep all those pillows.
Comic about this scene is best Pony comic ever!
Espy, there already is one
07,1tis magic
That was the first one Natleyn made :D
What? Where?
REVERSE STRIPTEASE
<3
GERONIMO
omg omg omg natleyn made another one b4???
AJ wins.
EspyLacopa: I already made one
cute snores...
Liiiink
I made Luna first 'cause I needed new cursors, and I ran with it
2,14 Applejack snores are adorable
natleyn just wins the internet now

EspyLacopa: I'm making all my favorite ponies as cursors
lights suddenly on.
Which is a lot of ponies.
'cause almost everypony is my favorite pony.
honestly natleyn you made my day
which is everypony...
Budgin, Ain't Ah.
inb4 camping
:D Luna cursors? Yay.~
o_O
I'll say everypony is best pony, but I'm not a big fan of some of the background characters, like Ace or... I dunno.
Other random ponies.
Lol.
Poor Ace.
if it can be called a pony, ill love the shit out of it
Ace does not get Natleyn's love.
/me pats Ace on the back
ace? whose that
Sorry bro.
tennis player pony
Ace is the tennis pony in Call of the Cutie
oh him
Ace was the owner of the Tennis Racket that Apple Bloom used in Call of the Cutie
with the awesome sideburns
Yes.
speaking of applebloom
hi applebloom!
But Mane six first, then Celestia, then random order of other ponies.
Inb4 Nat makes cursors for every single creature ever seen in MLP: FIM
speaking of apples...
/me gets his head out of the wall
Ace themed cursors
herospirit: Not doing a parasprite cursor :3
"Time to work on Parasprite #324"
hi everypony :)

Nat, since we "Dungeons and Ponies" together, your new nickname is Nat 20.
2,14 because Rarity/Fluttershy or RD/AJ are obvious pairs
To go with my NMM background and Chrome theme.
I used that as my nick during one campaign herospirit

Applebloom Enjoys this episode
so discord is basically helping twilight get the elements :/
dat title drop
You know i kind like how they ripped the Q snap and teleporting.
it really is like he wants to be turned to stone again.
Fun fact
choclate rain, some stay dry while others feel the pain
well he's a trickster bad guy
AJ must really like Tom
I still think that Meanie Pie is the pony version of Francis from L4D. :P
(I'm back)
Pinkie Pie is looks at twi when discord teleports them both back in time
superbrony: maybe so
Tom is best pony
This music is awesome!

Meanie Pie hates mountains.
Wow, Flutterbitch rules.

ohai bjornfot
DISCORD TURNED THIS POST INTO SOAP!
chaos, chaos everywhere
AHHH SEVRENNAAAAA!!

Let's play Twilight IN The Middle!
inb4 spike is new RD
Spike owned Flutterbitch
GIVE ME THAT BOOOK!
GIVE ME THAT BOOK
07,1autsj..
GIVE ME THAT BOOK
So. . . . . where's twilight's magic right now?
spike is rainbow dash is going to be a recurring theme in comics.
cat fight
nom
or so called pony fight
Clearly, Twilight isn't actually thinking, thus can't use her magic.
u mad, Twilight? =D
I'LL TAKE A BOOK...AND READ IT
BIG CROWN THINGY
too easy
the elements
Dat element
the elements
lol interior_gummy
when twilight gets stressed out she's at her best
Well then, that was anticimatic.
DISCORD TURNED THE ELEMENTS INTO SOAP!
what was pinkie doing with here hair?
necklace, necklace, necklace, necklace, big crown thing
Doesn't this mean that Discord vandalized one of Twilight's books?
love it how pinkie is is cleaning tom
this episode was such a letdown
inb4 Spike Dash
07,1big crown thingy
07,1brilliant
07,1:D
new rainbow dash!
BIG CROWN THINGY!!
*just about
the brute.
spike is now rainbow dash
YOU'RE RAINBOW DASH
YOU'RE THE NEW RAINBOW DASH
inb4 HERE COMES TOM
yay spike got promoted
Rainbow Spike?
too bad, your rainbow dash
yay! Promotion!
Spike is best pony
07,1ahahhaah
Spike got the highest rank possible D:
07,1this ep is amazing
We need to make sure to have dari change how @pony works with spike =p
i totally agree
Discord is best troll
Luna: Best episode ever
hah, thats fast
its been only like a few hours
That was fast Diftraku
inb4 fail.
Where's Spike?
FAIL
FISSION MAILED
lol
DISCORD TURNED OUR FRIENDSHIP INTO SOAP!
Spike never got off the ground.
MINE
MINE
ninjad
07,1flutterbitch
sheesh francis pie
07,1lolll
I wish this episode could of been better and wheres sweetie belle, me and scootaloo since they are the cause of discords breakout
Haha
i can't wait for the l4d videos
lol the sounds as he claps
Applebloom: You mean you don't know??
each clap had a diffrent sound
maybe a sound board with the mane cast
The Fellowship has failed.
speaking of princesses, why the hell was luna missing in this episode? isn't she co-ruler?
inb4 monochrome twilight
07,1oh no :(
Poor Twilight :(
because she was obviously cleaning up the rest of equestria
I hope that sound board thing luna has gets updated with discord.
wat
Aww. . . . NOOOOO
after discords mess
Screwball time!
ohai screwball!
We need an alternate ending where Discord wins.
:0
I almost wish that this two-parter episode had been a three-parter, and give more time to bringing the others back to their senses.
07,1ROFL
there will be fanfics herospirit
don't worry
:D
lol
<3 Discord!
Instead of. . .Twilight Learned Vulcan Mind Meld! It was Super Effective!
so much fanfic
soooo much
yeah, exactly but twilight cheated
this really could have made a amazing movie
this episode was way too rushed and discord went down too easily
04Discord isn't so much a bad guy as he is just...well...chaotic neutral
DISCORD TURNED HER NEW HOME INTO SOAP!
should have been a made-for-tv movie
yeah this would have been a great movie
he's chaotic evil
I agree completely Gummy.
Chaotic random perhaps
Discord turned the moon into swiss cheese
poor spike- I know that feel.
chaotic selfish omnipotent god
inb4 I knew a friendship Spell.
04He really should have been a supporting character that occassionaly follows Twilight around and gives comedic feedback and provides antics
I sympathise with spike.
i love this part
tbh, this and look before you sleep were the worst episodes
Discord grabs a cotton candy cloud, uses it to refill his glass with chocolate milk, drinks the glass, then throws the milk over his shoulder. Whereupon it explodes.
Best part
So you want him to be Q Ghosties ?
I agree, with both Ghosties and Gummy, xcept that I didn't think this was a bad ep
04I want him to be Sheogorath
FREAKING DUH TWILIGHT
*except
MLP already has a Shoggoth. THE SMOOOOOZE!
2,14 <3 Sheogorath
Sheogorath. xD
2,14 Shivering Isles was an amazing expansion
FOR PONY!
epic twilight pose
Sheogorath.
FOR EQUESTRIA!
Ruler of madness
07,1rofl
07,1wtf
big macindog
Cuhthuga is best elder god
flying pigs XD
big molentosh
Dog Mac <3
PONY FOR THE PONY GOD
Dog Macintosh!
i fight for my friends
anyone notice how aj reverse eat the apple?
and then a million TwiMac fics were born
Rape!
Where does Sheogorath come from?
Da Magics!
Dis music...
2,14 Elder Scrolls
im awesome
2,14 the Prince of Madness
Applejack's thinking: "Uh, Twi? Your horn's touching me....
04He's a Deadra
2,14 Sworn enemy of Jyggalagg
No you're not, dude don't lie.
04Daedra
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoggoth <-- I prefer this.
04And Jyggalagg is the Daedra of Order
bondageshy
Dont piss Sheogorath off, unless you want a rather unpleasant freefall..
lol
BONDAGESHY?
Let us never speak of this again...
07,1dumb rock!
LOLWUT
GET AWAY FROM TOM
rip tom
DUMB ROCK
FACE THE JUDGEMENT OF....
or they banished him to the everfree forest
not a shoggoth
sheoggorath from oblivion
CHAOS FOR THE CHAOS THRONE
or friendship for the friendship throne
so really, twilight just does the reverse of discord
forcibly mess with her friends minds
2,14 I know the best reward! CHEESE FOR EVERYONE! Well...unless you don't like cheese...in that case, CHEESE FOR NO ONE!
I TURNED GREY! HAHAHAHAHA!
JYGGALAGG!
inb4 that's nice
04Actually
what? i don't recall typing so fast
04Now that I think about it...
RainbowDash: Cool story Bro.
inb4 Applejack owning Rarity
04Pinkie Pie is like the pony version of Sheogorath
I love how she says awesome
Appletroll is best pony.
2,14 oh fun little note
honesty doesn't mean you can't troll
2,14 when RD loses her loyalty
2,14 she becomes Gilda
Soooo....
07,1rofl
fluttershy makes my day here
Gilda is BAWS
07,1flutter
Best line ever
"rainbow dash, can i rape you?"
Why didn't Discord just teleport away before being painbow'd?
cloud monorail
Herospirit, what do you think of this episode?
interior,may you shut up.
Epic balloon chase
07,1this is amazing
07,1I love this ep
I like it, but it was rushed.
because then he couldn't lose and the episode couldn't have ended
wonder why she doesn't change direction
/me agrees with luna very much
Pegacorn, dont shun other peoples creativity. XD
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SECURE THE RAP
yes but Discord was toooo passive
flutterrage time!
after all, its hard to change direction on a ballon
what herospirit said.
fluttershy is so freaking awesome
flutterrage
I agree, these two episodes should have been a movie.
shuuuuuun
Sonic Flutterboom
herospirit, indeed
2,14 and people were worried S2 wouldn't be as good :P
:D
it wasn't so far
07,1huuuug
part 1 was great, part 2 was a massive letdown
i liked this ep quite a bit.
04We won't really know until the third ep
up to this point I thought it was good
insta wingboney
Well gummy, remember S1E2?
04Since this was made at the end of S1
it's this part I think could do with revising.
he drink the glass xD
RD?HOLY GODDAMN.
inb4 chocolate boom
Oh man, extended edition of the Season 2 opening, as a full-blown movie.
i love this guy
Imagine it.
people apparently expected a massive, unstoppably huge battle.
/me bows before RD
Law of anime there
explosive chocolate milk ftw.
herospirit: yes, but i didn't join the herd until june
07,1bubble :o
i like how this played out actually
Erm.. Are you talking to me or the actual character?
yay bubble!
9 Guys
Pegacorn*
9 Guys
wow explosive chocolate milk was awesome
9 I figured something out
Guys
Hi DCD
hey DCD
I just wanna know why Discord just sits here and takes it.
RUN RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!
ohai dcd
9 It's enver explained who spammails via Spike
lol he's so cocky
see?
inb4 rarity car alarm
TELEPORT AWAY!
9 It's assumed to be Celestia...but wouldn't that feel unnatural for her?
06Dat attack~
why he isn't doing ANYTHING
Ohai DCD
its obvious thats its celestia
They said celistia did it DCD
I think it's because Discord isn't aware that the others fully recovered.
/me hugs NewDCD
maybe he's bound by his own nature to be overconfident
Discord was smarter than this earlier.
07,1what the...
Hey NewDCD
9 Nay, my mind has come to the conclusion...that it was LUNA who sent the letters, not Celestia
pew
Sonic Flutterboom
After all, last time, he /did/ just sit there.
pew
04PEW PEW PEW
pew
TASTE THE RAINBOW
/me fired
pew
taste the rainbow motherfucker!
pew
06Neigh~
2,14 but celestia is already a confirmed troll
Discord DGAF.
2,14 one or two letters would have been more than enough
NOOOOOOOOOO!
He should have put his shades on.
07,1too soon!
inb4 Star Wars ending
07,1TOO SOON!
2,14 instead, she kept sending them to the point of inflicting pain on spike
moral of the episode: friendship is magic
2,14 that spells troll to me
06NOT SOON ENOUGH!
herospirit: until the rainbow actually worked, it looked exactly the same as their failed attempt
induringstarwarsending
lol star wars ending
Cool Reference
star wars ending
2,14 que star wars music
inb4 DCD sings
06lol
Nerd-gasm
9 Celestia would know the effects on Spike. Actually, that brings forward another point: the reports on Friendship? They serve a double function, and one of them is educating Luna on Friendship before she can feel comftable with the New Equestria
herospirit: Also, he calls them frenemies, assuming they're still angry at each other.
Except they weren't grey anymore, Natleyn
04LUNA SENT THEM
04THAT'S WHO DID IT
:0
Maybe Discord is color blind.
overall, discords final fight could have been made into something more than an "okay I'll get turned into stone again"
07,1dat heroism
Your wrong Ghosties
herospirit: yeah, but he didn't notice that.
Philomena sent them
this made me feel so awesome to be a brony
just wait till the continuation "Discord Strikes Back"
Who knows how Discord's mind works.
How could you... not notice that...
He's /Discord/
celestia never told you about the elements
/me cries no Luna
04But Philomena is just one bird
/me shrugs
2,14 and then Discord becomes Twilight's real father
she told me enough! she told me you stole them
oooo now what we gonna watch luna?
/me hugs Combustiblelemons
TwilightSparkle is gonna miss discord
04HOW CAN ONE BIRD HAVE SO MUCH POWER
^_^
I SHALL TAKE OVER
AND USE ZA POWA
No...you are the elements
Twilight stole the elements
i know you can't do much of an epic battle, but at least have him last a bit longer, and have the transformation sequence back to normal
No no. Discord. . .is Twilight's real MOTHER!
its celstias pet Ghosties
Its magic Ghosties, I dont have to explain shit :P
GLORIOUS
longer
celestias*
I demand a redo! Someone wake up Discord!
NO ONE BIRD SHOULD HAVE ALL DAT POWAH
07,1hmm the battle was a bit too short
love the streams =3
so in other words, this couldn't work as a 22 minute episode
hilariously quiet theatre
Fight the power!
perhaps it's just rarity
w/e thanks bronystate
start a argument and he will come back
bronycon was awesome
should have been a feature length film
are you going to stream something else?
RETS GO RETS GOKAIGER
Quick, someone get the Cutey Mark Crusaders!
04Don't forget that the "battle" with Nightmare Moon was also short
also, whoever can go to new york comic con should go
this battle needs at least 4 eps
twilight didn't even activate her bankai
pff, lame
Ghosties: yeah, but the setup to it in the everfree forest made it better
regardless rarity is still best pony and theatre
07,1I would have loved a little more chaos
^
Nightmare Moon also actually tried fighting back =/
in this one, they simply walked into ponyville
so would I
04And there was setup here
Then Twilight befriends Discord Nanoha style
and killed him
/me brohoofs golfcourse
Aww yeah.
3 episodes of discord would have been alright imo
Nightmare Moon fought back? Huh?
04Most people preferred Nightmare Moon
the first half seemed rushed
streamception!!!
STREAMCEPTION
07,1all over :P
ohai youtube
discord can't beat nightmare moons butt anytime :D
SNUGGLY WUGGLY
meh i'll stop complaining
Lol, the second recommended vidoe
video*
Woona
She stood there and got toasted by the rainbow too, what "fight back" exactly? O.o
Nightmare Moon and Twilight charged eachother head first. Twilight just activated the EoH before she could do anything else.
9 I'm ready
07,1alright
Discord almost got away with it, if it weren't for that meddling troll princess!
SNUGGLY WUGGLY
The videos recommended to you are based on what you search for
07,1DCD is taking over
and discord tried to forcibly pull all her friends to him.
so yeah, this was meh, but i liked it a little better the second time
Luna
07,1you folks have a nice night
What have you been watching
9 Just for a little while though
04See ya, Sath
2,14 see ya woona
by luna!!!
/me hugs Luna goodnight
G'night LUna.
DCD, do an improvised entertainment again soon :D
Thanks Luna!
bye Luna
Night Luna
discord better than nightmare moon :)
Bye Luna
night Luna
and bye luna!
/me glomps Luna
bye luna
night Luna
/me hugs luna
Later Luna!~
bye luna
hopefully you appear in season 2
/me waves goodbye to Luna
/me demands improvised entertainment
see you in a few episodes
9 And we're live
9do you get signal?
also, they trolled us by not having luna in this episode
yup
ywa
main screen turn on
04Set us up the bomb
yes*
we copy loud and clear./
she was mentioned a million times
Release all Zig!
All your base are belong to us
and never appears, even though she's the co-ruler
hello gentlecolts, all your ponyville are belong to us
wuts this
9 You do. NOW LET'S GO FULL RETARD
...I have no idea what this it
YES
This episode was written before the fangasm over Luna. :p
but it looks like magical girls
Now what is this
>is not an anime fan.
9 Nanoha.
she's still the co-ruler, so why would she not appear?
One of my friends just said R34 Paheal is down, and people are blaming the MLP S2 Premier
NewDCD: What anime is this?
LOL
HUEG EYES
*gets heavily flamed(
9 AKA: MAGICAL GIRLS POWERED BY HOT BLOOD AND MECHA TROPES
what if that vision that applejack had was maybe true you never know
TAKE OFF EVERY ZIG
night everyone!
9 IT'S LIKE I'M WATCHING GURREN LAGANN WITH MAGICAL GIRLS
so...anime my little pony?
07,1sound is gone
anime??? awww
/me hugs NewDCD
AWWWW YEAH
sounds fine for me
9no sound?
uh... derp derp. Y no Robuts?
07,1and fixed
i'd have voted for doctor who, but i'm a hopeless fanboy
still got sound here
9oh okay
07,1was on my end
Better question: why would she? She's been imprisoned for a thousand years and hasn't experienced the world in all that time.
goodnight everyone :)
goodnight Combustiblelemons!
Good night
because she theoretically is supposed to co-rule with celestia?
goodnight combutiblemons :)
I'd figure she'd be out exploring the world she's been so removed from, and learning about the power of friendship that helped save her.
night lemons!
Guys
hero
oui?
R34 Paheal is down, and people are blaming the MLP S2 Premier
9 God someone should make a Nanoha parody with ponies. It's the only natural conclusion. THEY ARE MANLY SHOWS FOR MANLY MEN.
Lol
Yeah, but when she tried to get moon duties back, Celestia sent her TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAA.
DCD i issue you a challange, change my views on anime =p
get your spoony ass in the session
lets go
NEWDCD! WOO!
Why do magical girls need wands?
why do ponies need friendship?
why do men watch a girls cartoon?
To channel. . .da magicks!
Why does Discord need an umbrella?
why does spike not have a moustache?
for utter chaos XD
04WHERE WAS GONDOR
Hey NewDCD
these are the questions we must know!
Do you like Fate/Stay Night?
I do
I do not.
....What is this?
04CosmicChan, what's your opinion on anime?
silver!
9 Never watched it.
psst!
not a very good one =x
Herospirit is gone.. :(
04Why not?
not a fan
/me let is get away
i need your help to be a NPC!
so all in all, this episode disappointed me, but compared to the rest of tv it was decent
NewDCD: It's really just a bunch of GAR.
Herospirit is here.
it*
RIGGGHT HEEEEERE
>.>
idk i never really liked it thaat much, idk why
9 Anime is cartoons made in Japan. One should judge on the individual basis rather than on a so-called "genre" in general
used to bore me, this one looks cool tho
Fate Stay/Night bored me to tears.
anime is ass, bro.
04Hmm
I prefer Berserk
too many high school, perverted stuff
I didn't like that much either, because it doesn't make sense when the CMC caused discord to break out in the first place
04You should watch Cromartie High School. I'm not a fan of anime much myself, but Cromartie is unbelievably good
MrChang: You should go watch Usagi Drop.
damn hasbro probably limited it to two episodes so that they could show more PINK BABY PONIES
9 MrChang: I hate those shitty shows, but not all animu is that
and they never showed up
y'all should go watch Gintama
most down to earth anime
ever.
What NewDCD said.
sooo what's this? it seems awfully girly
hmm
9 Gintama is too fucking long
its the ONLY one i watch
04Everything Japanese is girly
04...wait
Just like almost everything, about 95% of japanese cartoons is crap.
04No
/me is watching 3 anime right now at the same time
9 Bjornfot It's GURREN LAGANN WITH MAGICAL GIRLSSSSSSSSSSS
IT"S A GUNDAM!
04That's not true
when it should have been n 88 minute episode
i'll go back to watching who
o rly
what.jpg
u guys watch PSG?
ITSA PEENCH
04Fist of the North Star is the manliest damn anime ever
Ghosties: Puella Magi Madoka Magica?
9 People call Nanoha the "Gundam Magical Girl"
Ohai Nanoha
fist of the north star and the DB series are the manliest
Gintama is the most funny anime to ever live.
Morning Guys
07,1goodnight everypony
No, TORIKO is manliest.
berserk is the manliest
hands down
wait, why am i still complaining about the mlp episode?
9 I suppose that makes Madoka the Evangelion Magical Girl...
04Night
night Luna
night luna!!!!!!!
night Luna
goodnight luna :)
'Night uuuuuuuu
Good night Luna
they're all doing crap in high school
You guys will love the transformation scenes
9 Also >yfw I'm planning on streaming The Legend of Kenshiro OVA
/me hugs Luna good night
to be honest, high school isn't even THAT interesting
*hugs luna goodnight*
is it in english?
There's always Ouran High School Host Club.
04@FriendshipCannon: Trust me, Fist of the North Star isn't high school
04Now
9 KISS KISS FALL IN LOVE
LOL
think fallout 3
9 That said I avoid most high school stuff
with kung fu
fist of the north star is just so manly
9 It's boring
04Cromartie is, but it's incredbily entertaining
still, it was the worst episode of the series along with look before you sleep
I love Cromartie
NewDCD, you should stream teh Gurren Lagann Paralell Works
ATATATATATATATATATATA
9 Impliedincest.avi
though most of the bad episodes were due to executive meddling
Cromartie High was great
NewDCD: Azumanga Daioh
YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD.
beep beep
Everyone aboard the Yukari-mobile!
04BEEP BEEP IMMA JEEP
9 Yeah k Madoka can we get to the part in which you BEFRIEND THE SHIT OUT OF EVERYONE USING THE STAR LIGHT BREAKER?
Cromartie is soooo manly. (giggles)
TheMaster, I dont think FO3 anymore, I think FO:E
I needed some Nanoha-style friendship
That's what MLP needs
thats true, I think of the doctor as a pony sometimes to
9 Magical Girl Lyrical Lyra
Discorb being befriended Nanoha style
9 And Bonbon Testarossa
so much new my little brony stuff on the vote page
Ding. :o
>derpy appeared with normal eyes
Inb4 a horrible MlP FiM anime is made.
Spike Scrya?
so in conclusion, meh episode, but still hoping the best for episode 3 next week
It'll happen
they made an anime about wolverine and ironman
they both suck.
They did it to PPG
9>Next Week
9 I have news for you.
OOOoooooooooo
the PPG anime was confusing
Jimmy: mah rittle ponee?
Applebloom Perhaps the CMC Will Appear in Episode 3
9 There's at least a two-week hiatustill Ep 3
FURENDSHEEP BEAAAMU
LEMON
DCD, you should stream PSG at some point
ON
YOUR FACE
twilightsparkle: you really think so twilight
CONFOUND YOU HASBRO
Is the newsletter out yet 'cause I did not get it if it is.
NOBODY GIVES A SHIT ABOUT FAMILY GAME NIGHT!
9 WINNING WINNING WINNING WINNING
Twilight and Applejack with Celestia?
VINNING
Applebloom I know so Applebloom its gonna be a good season
wining
9 BE QUIET-U
BE QUIET
So, if they make a bad MlP FiM anime
Which Pony will have a giant robot?
twa
Fluttershy
all of them
9 >Bad Anime
Spike.
scootaloo
9 >Giant Robots
>ponies
I don't want to be in a bad anime :(
Snails
It happens DCD
pick one
TWIST
IMPOSSIBRU!!
Celestia is best giant robot.
9 Son those two phrases don't work in the same phrase when you mix it with FIM
I now understand why people hate this chatbox.
.......
I could do it DCD
9 And then MTFs became canon
If I tried, I could do it.
ohai Trollestia !
No you could not
tasukete
/me hugs Trollestia
9 Jimmy: I'm actually designing Pony-use mechs for a crossover scenario
Hiya
well, more pokemon time =3
NewDCD: This is why I love you
Do it DCD. DO EET.
9 I HAVE FOUND A FERRET
/me is just collecting the network adress to use my client.
address
AND NOW I AM GOING TO PLEASURE MYSELF WITH THIS TROUT
olol
Why a trout?
9 They're called MTFs (Mount Frames) and take advantage of the innate magic of each of the three pony classes
why not a trout?
mmmmm, trout
Nanoha
actually im gonna go for a bit now, ill be back later, bye guys =D
06Going to bed now everypony . . . Ich liebe dich alle! :3
bye CosmicChan
/me hugs VioletVanilla goodnight

SPOILERS: The doctor is the villain
06Bye SuperBrony64~ c:

Look what I did *squee* http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/63124
Jimmy, send me a PM. I cant find you on the user list -.-
Wait guys. If they made an MLP anime....
Later VioletVanilla :3
9 Poor Nanoha
3 Good afternoon
Spoiler: Men don't actually exist in the world of Nanoha. That's why they slowly disappear as the series progress and she grows up.
How would they make Fluttershy any more moe?
9 Oh wow she's smart
/me hugs Denied_Existence
Hello~
so, why the brief pony hiatus?
Hi Denied_Existence
06Danke schön Veewave~
/me 3hugs Natleyn
9 Ferret Care: the anime
/me gets hit by a train
9 also this segment was obviously made by a different animation house
hi Denied!
Fluttershy probably *couldn't* be more moe.
9 Goddamn it Nanoha just befriend something already
gabemoist: hi
Yeah did't this show start as a spin off of a hentai DCD?
/me is driving the train
Anybody here?
i just felt something....
Sumica: Yes.
9 Apparently. And then it became MAGICAL GIRLS: THE MECH ANIMU
yes
#bronystate
is the main chat
I have no idea why an anime is playing on the left of this..
Triangle something I think
SOOOOONEEEEEEEC UDAINBOOMU
Just watched the episode
9>Please come to me
because its better than Babes in toyland
9 BOW WOW CHIKA BOW WOW
Confound you, DashWithRainbows!
AWESOME!
REVENGE!!!
Heh.
Seriously, we need to make a cheesy MLP anime.
rawr
Homework Time! Later everypony!
I cant pause it either.
its a live stream
9 AWW YEAH
/me slaps Dash with a large trout
we are all watching it
Oh.
ow...
9IT'S BEFRIENDING TIME
Here comes the Befriending.
Bye SuperBrony64
/me runs away
/me hugs SuperBrony64 goodbye
Is it on the mane stream or backup?
FRIENDSHIP!
bye superbrony64:
muhuhaha
Im figuring during the stream of part 2 you couldnt pause it,Could you?
Bye SuperBrony
so is this hentai?
hugs superbrony64
No.
no
Lol dat ferret
This anime is not hentai.
nope
no sorry
9 And here, good sirs, is where we divert from most magical girl animus.
we are not mods
/me win
we just help out
O.o
Is it lagging a tiny bit for anypony else? o_o
dat ferret
Which stream is it?
Where, DCD? The giant killy thing?
dont claim victory yet Veewave
One thing,Where exactly is this steaming from?
*streaming*
No
Like..What channel?
its is being streamed by the moderator known as NewDCD
The friendship
Watch out Nanoha, Ganon is trying to kill you!
no channel
The friendship man
Veemi I think
:0
but screw it, i'm too mad about today's pony ep to think about ponies too much
Yeah. I know i ask a shitload of questions :l
i dno*
Friendship? :0
not really.
your just curious is all
Better ask the mods in the bronystate tab
It's Aku, the shapeshifting master of darkness!
^
His word is law.
so fuck it, the show is ruined until the next episode, when i will hopefully fall back in love
Throw the CHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESE!
2,14 ....really?
So if a new MLP episode comes out its streamed here?
I haven't seen episode 2 yet, need I gtfo in the meantime?
It wasn't that bad gummy. :0
9HENSHIN.....GUNDAAAAAAAAAMMM!!
2,14 not going to lie, that's rather pathetic gummy
yes
but it is said the next episode is in 2 weeks
ValtheJean is right.
Movie night is on friday
I got told 3 weeks
Just go to EqD, they have links Trollestia
Raising, or Raging?
some people just can't be pleased.
well its just a rumour
2,14 but hey, love and tolerate and whatnot. So you're entitled to your opinion
i know, but it was so damn overhyped
Is there anyway you can make like a homepage in google chrome?
9 let's go, GUNDAM!!!!!!!!!!
At least Nanoha had the choice to design her own magic outfit. That's way better than most other magical girls
i dont have google chrome, sorry
this anime is reminding me of a other anime oh yeah,sailor moon
ask someone in #bronystate for help
YOU GETTIN' MUGGED,KID!
Imagine if the next episode of MLP would be a halloween special,Sort of like Edd Ed N eddy went down.
And she doesn't use a wand. . .she uses an actual Staff.
LOL SAILOR MOON
dude...
Better for befriending/hitting people upside the head with.
Nope.You're getting mugged.
Applebloom: Silly, thats not how you spell magical girl animes
9Ohai Gundam
AAAAAAAAAAH HOW THE HELL DOES THAT EVEN WORK?
Ed. Edd n Eddy is one of my childhood cartoons
I know man.
/me can leave this one to Dash
3So how did everyone like E2 today?
/me hugs Pegacorn
Welcome back
/me GTFOs to EQD to watch episode two.
damn right you will
It's a Gundam?
Denied_Existence: I loved it :3
Heh.
still going to et revenge for the trout
get*
/me is damn right
Who the hell is Flaria anyways?
TOTALLY NOT SAILOR MOON
Natleyn.
I still think that would be a good idea
The Gundam aspect becomes very, very, obvious in the second season. Wherein the tools have bullet-shaped cartridges that they use to supercharge their spells.
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
9>Sailor Moon
Who the hell is Pegacorn anyway?
halloween episode would be good
I mean,Discord is defeated
9>All Magical Girl animus ever
flaria: well... the transformation reminds me of it
So whats next
?
my lover/bitch, trollestia
3Robots, robots everywhere....
oic
YOU GETTIN' MUGGED TROLLESTIA!
no one knows...
Pegacorn: lolno
/me mugs Pegacorn
thats why we wait for next episode
Nanoha also loves being a magical girl, and trains her ass off.
No muggin's please
/me is now richer
IT'S A GUND-...MAGICAL GIRL.
Nope Veewave,you're getting mugged!
DAT RIKA VOICE
She actually ends up hospitalized because she trains too much.
It's totally Rika

/me is mugged *sad face*
I just wish
Veewave,it was a asdfmovie4 reference.
The people who made these awesome backgrounds
Knew how to actually draw the ponies
/me is oblivious
if you have any other questions, i am willing to answer them (if i can)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYNdUM2gRsg&feature=related
THERE.
AllisZero: What?
Well i got like a sort of Poll question
if you dont have any more questions just go into the main chat
go ahead, what you want to ask?
Alright,I will be right back
got to wait for my next who episode to get loaded up. guess its time for more magical girls
9 Fun Fact: Even with that tame first episode, this animu includes Magical Girls flying at unholy speeds and breaking building windows with the sonic boom at match speed
Nvm
Hey.
9 *mach
yay
I was thinking,Dont you think a halloween special would be cool for the next episode?
Are we watching all of it?
9 Not NOW, but eventually
Dont forget the labrinth bypass methyod DCD.
The first two seasons of this show are wonderful.
9 thismight be the last thing I stream fortonight
9 I actually have never watched Nanoha
heeeeeeeeeeeee?
/me throws the cheese
AKU!
ok NewDCD, i will go to bed when you stop...
did card capture sakura rip this off?
because it looks similiar from what I remember
I can pick after you are done DCD.
9GRATUITUOUS ENGRISHI
Master, this came after CCSakura.
oh
9 SUDDENLY FANCY MATHEMATICS
It's Digimon
Fancy mathmatics to muddle every issue
damn mathematics, they always muddy the issue!
Ive never watched this show ironically.
:l
I think Card Captor Sakura came out in the mid-nineties. . ./me checks wikipedia
Yup, mid nineties.
was that probection?
spelled out?
thats what i saw
9 DAT STAFF
Both the CCS manga and anime ended in 2000.
atleast she has something covering her lower half. unlike another magical girls show I can think of -cough-strikewitches-cough-
/me marvels at winged staffs
This show started in 2004.
That staff reminds me of something off Yu-Gi-Yo..I really dont know why.
>stand by ready
LOLWUT
eventually they'll make a magical girl anime and try and handwave away that they have to wear clothes
They will never make a new anime,Sadly
The world is being consumed by shitty animated shows
have hope, they're making a new berserk anime
or movie
Like this new shit on CN..I mean come the fuck on.
9 They're making a new Rurounin Kenshin anime too
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This
9 also: I should totally stream My Life Me sometime
/me trollfaces
...not sure if serious
OH, the by the way, you think I was joking about one of Nanoha's friends being a vampire? HA!
9>Watching Nanoha for theplot and not for the BEFRIENDING
So I click back and there's a talking ferret. wut
Ok, not a vampire. She's a ghost with a grudge against everything living.
Odd,about almost all of the people here arent talking. lolwut
im watching it because its on stream...
Then Nanoha punched her in the face, and they became friends. True story.
who would wear their hair like that?
@ SploogeTheFish that always happens
Im watching it because its a tad entertaining.
with a giant...blog on the side of your head
usualy 80 people and about 20 speak
her too!
Not 20 currently
Seriously, the punch to the face happens in a flashback in this show.
/me speaks
was earlier...
Only like..6-8
9 Nanoha fucks your shit up with MAGICAL POWER OF AWESOME and somehow that makes you befriend her
her hair fringe flipped!
probably about 7-9 max
Yup
9Nanoha has what I like to call FULL-CONTACT FRIENDSHIP
Nanoha doesn't /actually/ need magic powers to BEFRIEND people. It's just more fun that way.
She can do it by punching people in the face.
9And she also is the poster girl for Defeat Equals Friendship
9I wish I could befriend people by Rider Kicking them ;___;
NewDCD: Have you tried it?
9Yeah. They just explode twice.
Ah. I suppose that /would/ be a problem.
I was reading on the pony thread on funnyjunk,people said they where a little dissapointed how discord was already done
9 Man how would it be if her love interest was a ferret. Let us be glad that Nanoha is into Fate : 3
People were thinking he would say "Suprise!" and just fly away somewhere
>implying discord had a chance of making it past episode 2
there are weirder ships in the universe
dc has a gorrila and a brain in a jar as a canon gay couple
What was his chance? lolwut
9Case in point: Fluttershy X Bloomberg
/me is in love with distractions
Besides, now Celestia can get back to trolling.
NewDCD: Remember, men in Nanoha's world don't actually exist.
What would you do if all the ponies got turned onto discords side? (aka turning grey)
I just saw one though
They're just imaginary friends that slowly vanish as she grows up.
<3
9 Right. I forgot.
theres one!
you can see the back of his head
;):):(:'(6_9:S:[<3:|:P:D:O:$
9NANOHA, TEACHING US JAPANESE
So,Do you stream anything else?
What about Jail Spaghetti from Strikers?
She's got a mental block where her dad is concerned: he actually got killed by terrorists when she was 3 or 4 years old.
Terrorists during 9/11 im presuming.
KIHEN IS FLUTTERSHY
He's a men
Note, Nanoha never met Jail. Fate fought him, supposedly.
alright, time for more doctor who
Everyone is just humoring her slowly disappearing delusions.
I AM A STEGOSAURUS.
Admin?
When you have enough magical power to blow up moons, you're far more willing to play along with harmless things like that.
Admin? D:

BroNYCon was hype
So, what's this about?
i have no idea!
k
Hi Val
2,14 hello
9 Aww man I've never watched Star Driver. I really should. AlsoCaramel is totally a GINGA BISHOUNEN
9 Also I figured something out
3Hey ValtheJean
It's about giant robots and school life.
Vals back?!?!?
3Connection derp
9If Nanoha was a boy.
9He'd use RAGING BONER to transform instead
why did that guy have half op?
/me rimshot
Eeyup!
Must...resist...color
2,14 hmmm....I think my internet be derping....the stream is lagging really bad for me
She's my favorite pony.
those croquettes
Teehee. Dropped the link to Flutter F to a non-believer. Commence conversion. :p
Why do you people call voice "half-op?"
no lag here
/me also got his hair cut today. But he had to leave BroNYCon to do so.
2,14 because he is a half-op, but the chat we merged with doesn't have a half-op status
Caramel is dazzling the stage?
Wait are we calling Takuto Caramel now?
2,14 damn...the hell is wrong with my computer? it's just stuttering like fuck
in4 everyone gets raped
9Of course Espy. After all, why do you think he was in Cloudsdale
They need to watch out for crocs in the pool. Unlike Gummy, these have teeth.
sounds like a personal problem *Trollface*
any one else havving issues or is it just Val?
9 Those wings were fake, he was just there to DAZZLE THE STAGE with his transformation
Bjornfot!Y U ALWAYS THINK ABOUT RAPE?
/me thinks about rape

Sumica: I know, isn't it awesome?
yep
That's just how faaabulous this show is.
gonna show a second ep
For what I saw,that was pretty awesome.
and if I suddly drop blame the thundarstorm rolling in to the vally.
I ended up marathoning this show after its run ended instead of watching it as it was released.
after this perhaps SRW OG
and back to dr.who
I dont have Dr who, that is Dari
I meant for myself
I forgot there was a new Dr.Who tonight.
ah
It was a good un.
we had a pretty awesome who marathon last night though
indeed
For those who didn't catch the first two episodes: The fabulous villains are trying to find all four Maidens of the island to destroy their mystical connection to that phased place they fight their giant robots in.
got some new converts too
The first Maiden was that girl in the cage.
Thanks EspyLacopa.
Wako is another of the four Maidens.
The other two haven't been revealed by this point.
Each has their own song that they sing during their respective arc when the Crux is gearing up their Robot of the Week.
oh yeah, so how was the new episode stream todya, guys?
Amazing, of course.
9Pretender: went without a hitch. Glad it did, after the fiasco last week

/me plans on naming his son Davis after Davis from Digimon.
Val: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=momjHvCbwTc
Spoiler: The Third Maiden has already been introduced. I forgot to mention that earlier.

zplayer would not do that video hang.
NewDCD, Val already ragequit :p

Zoidberg's an Emperor

She's a caged bird, of course there're chains.
AND THEN EVERYONE WAS ZOMBIES

Zombie PONIES
Oh, the age regresser is in the /next/ episode.

9 well gotta go, later
aww
"rawr"
sudnly opening
later, NewDCD
later DCD
take care DCD
bye, again
The Maidens have a rather poor job: They can't leave the island so long as they're connected to that fancy fighting place.
Maintaining the seals.
/me waits in NewDCD's bushes
And it's not that They made a vow to stay on the island. They literally cannot leave the island.
Bye NewDCD!
/me hugs NewDCD goodnight
The second Maiden finds out the hardway how that works.
I want that.
GUNDAMNS
Gundam Alex is best Gundam because it has my name
inb4 sex
The series sorta kinda maybe hints at where the mechs actually came from, but it's very very vague.
No Bjornfot, not at all.
aww
>implying sexual tension ever leads to sex
breking a maidens seal sounds like simbolsium.(sp)
bow chicka bow wow?
Spoiler: Takuto breaks Wako's seal
dammit caboose
I dont know GGgala, you could have fooled me.
hey all
piiinch
anyone interested in populating my Equestria MUSH?
Sounds like work.
/me has no clue what mush is
Never cared much for Mush's.
populating?
if you mean what i'm thinking, I'M IN
lol, rite
Multi-User. . .something something?
/me thinks the same as Bjrnfot
...
Blue glowy heart!
I know MUD is Multi-User Dungeon
Multi User Shared Hallucination
that would be more like repopulating Bjornfot
aww...
it's kinda like a cross between IRC and world building
why do you guys always have to spoil my fun?
text based mmorpg
a wild DCD reappears
suddenly mobile phone
it saves us from having to mop the floors later Bjornfot
anyhoos, it's on test.du.cx port 4201, if anyone wants to connect
currently it has nothing in it
/me likes spoiling Bjornfot's sexbased plans
because it's 2am here and i'm too tired to write
but i'll work on it a bit tomorrow
but, zombiewave, I NEED MY PONYCEPTION FIX
grab yourself a MUD client or just use telnet
guys what if I drew Magical Girl Sparkler Twilight
Is Cupcakes canon there? That would be fun.
/me NO SOup for you
DO IT DCD
should be cool dcd
Ok
saw twilight gundam the othere night on a drawfriend.
I'm getting the hang of this
should she befriend Trixie
DCD, ja
Sumica: if it was the Unicorn repainted, that was me
no it was bipedal
no I mean as in the RX-0
ohhh yeh
The Unicorn Gundam
probably was yours then.
Fabulous transformation sequence.
hold on
Gonna fetch mine in Ponibooru for cross-reference
Dazzling the stage!
everyone is gar for galactic pretty boy
I don't think you know what gar means.
...Stupid cowardly mech.
Wait, this isn't Star Driver
Yes it is.

Oh, so you just missed the fabulous transformation sequence.

Sam the Squid-Piercer? How do you earn that nickname
I swear
Piercing squids, of course.
evil Zoidberg? noooo
Bones got some hobo from the streets
loots of booze and a late night at seaworld
Wait, this is by Sunrise isn't it
Anyway, they got some hobo, gave him LSD and a notepad
Told him to write the stories that chick tells
That's why, Sam the Squid-piercer
So, what's next on the stream?
nichijou
Ah, haven't watched that.
then Bebop
never heard of nichijou....
it translates to "my ordonary life"
lol wut
what was that a live action of...
Good commercials
'The Most Beautiful Death in the World'? what
BROWNIES
How goes it?
dat video tearing
yeah I hate VLC for that
NICHIJOUUUUUUUUUUU
cat!
:I
Zplayer never dose that to me
<3
:U
ohay Prison--oh crap is your show on tonight?
now which anime is this?
It's on tomorrow
I keep coming back to different ones
OHIO BRONIES MEETUP WEEKEND 2011
Hmmm. This looks delightfully silly.
oh it is
The Ohio bronies and I just went to the Renaissance Festival today
mmm, not sure if want
Shoo be doo? Did I hear that right?
...wtfisthis
THEY HAVE NO MOE
I wish there were bronies in Panama
Aside from the 14-year-kid I know from Ponychan.
He's alright, but I'm 20 years old and would like someone at least a year older
Sumica, you watched Usagi Drop?
But at 14, they're fresh.
Ripe for the picking
or PLUCKING
or dicking
Have it but havent watched it yet.
if you only read your last sentence, dcd.... it sounds like, um...
'Cept his male and DCD's barn door don't swing that way
I have it all downloaded, but I still have only watched up to ep4.
Mai, is always trolling.
one of those talking girl shows like Lucky Star?
Slice of Life, you mean
MobileDCD: Best euphemism for sexuality
what I mean is, I hear madmax is 15
I'd probably hang out with her if I could
But for some reason 14 feels awkward for some strange reason
lolpedo~
Azumanga Daioh is still the best slice of life.
a genre of slice of life
Azumanga Daioh? That's not how you spell "Nichijou"
but yeah
Nichijou doesn't have Penguin Chiyo.
Azumanga has charming moments of silence. Not sure if this one had them.
DAT AFRO
lol
I think it's a cultural thing
14 years are still seen as kids here, and 15 year olds are already treated like adults
I also think I feel more comftable with a 5-year age gap rather than a 6-year age gap
lol
1 year plus or minus...
Hey Bjornfot, did you die for our sins?
5 or 6 younger, i'd hit him anyway
What is with this show?
it's made of random
inorite
yes, epsylacopa, i did
but hell didn't want me so they sent me back
Bjornfot I thought you weren't into guys but in the last few days I've been inclined to think otherwise
:I
:l
mobviledcd, you know veyr well that my barn door does not discriminate
it's like, common knowledge
Bjornfot seems to like any thing with a pulse as of late.
so are you or are you not?
Either is fine but confusion is a terrible thing for bystanders
Bjornfot is Captain Jack Harkness?
remember when you streamed yourself?
when we made you read me x pegacorn?
where was Gondor when DCD streamed himself?
Gondor was on the can
srsly wtf is wrong with this show
he was sitting on a can?
Bjornfot you said you weren't gay at that moment
You could have just said you were bi man D:
yesh
that must of hurt after a while
yeah mobiledcd
i'm not gay
A robot girl?
yes EspyLacopa
Captain Bjornfot Harness
you don't have to be gay to like the same sex >_>
built by a child.
bisexuality is actually very common and trendy nowadays
i don't like labeling myself, though
What just happened?
i have no idea what this discussion is about...
i'm just... sexual
i don't discriminate
ahhhhh I see
That makes sense
/me is allergic to cats.
Meow.
/me is also allergie to moe. ACHOO
/me hates cats....
FLUFFY!
men, women, transgender, hermaphrodites, ponies...
yeah labels are kind of a necessary evil
They're convenient but can lead to problems and discrimination
all ok in my book
so you are a Trysexual? Try any thng?
DashWithRainbows: You make me sad. :(
no sumica
Pansexual
>Ponies
Thaaaaaaat's going a bit too far bro
i'm a STOP LABELING ME AND LEAVE ME ALONE
im sorry but i just dont like them :l
im just gunna Bjornfot as Bjornfot
not real ponies, mobiledcd
label *
/me gets labelgun
Talking cat!
But I like youuu. ;_;
only FiM ponies
Also what's with that cat's face?
/me marks Bjornfot down to half-price
because it wouldn't really be bestiality, since they have human intelligence and can talk and all
Let's just say you're omnisexual
Because everything sounds cooler with omni- before it
i think it would be ok, to bang them, if they were real
:D
._.
Bjornfot for half price!?!?!
Dat face
GIVE ME 10 OF THEM NAO!
unbeatable bargain!
:I
....
/me goes to the back room to check if there are more Bjornfots
guy screams at a doll.
that said
Bjornfot, human intelligence on non-humans raises an interesting point I wish to address on my fics
Scream? I dunno if you can call it that
mk
/me only has 1
darn...
It was more like....he suddenly had asthma.
We can order more
only 1 bjorn....
but, really...
everypony would be ok with, like, spike x rarity, right?
nah im just gunna go buy more jetpacks instead
because if the non-physical aspect of love is based on kindred spirits and complimenting personalities
so why not human x spike or human x rarity?
because of the Empathy Effect
Spike's underage. Otherwise, w/e floats your boat. :p
fuck taboo
fuck morals
fuck society
case in point: chances are we're very, very distantly related
what is the discussion between Bjornfot and MobileDCD even about!??!
screwing ponys I think DashWithRainbows
it's not society, though. It's a species' natural progression
fuck norms
/me grabs handgun
Does Bjornfot wear a skirt or a kilt?
eeenope
Not norms, but rather, a method of natural population control
/me grabs Dash's other gun
i'm not that hipster.. yet
im ready to end this shit
when it gets out of hand... i mean hoof...
you see
/me 's gun goes "cha-chick"
how you gonna work the trigger with a hoof?
/me did not think this through....
thousands of years ago
IDEA!
/me solved this with bigger triggers
more gun?
/me flys to his weapons bunker and grabs a missle
OH SHI-
when the homo sapiens started to appear upon the Earth
/me flies above everypony holding missile
/me gets in mooncannon
does this answer your question?
brb. Sociology lesson later
/me fires mooncannon
awww
so you want to kill every one that has even heard the conversation?
/me is on the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
maybe...
Shoo be doo?
only if it gets seriously out of hoof
Now I will be the only survivor
...on the moon
i live on the moon, i will be returning...
/me still has Dash's modified gun
bullets will go slower on the moon
/me goes faster on the moon
and i use a jetpack to fly in space
It's physics
Why does she have a massive gun?
Kay
So, it's not because of the norms of society that we avoid these situations, but rather, due to a biologically self-programmed population response in our species
because...who doesnt carry a gun to school
she is Tsugundri
/me has massive gun
yeah right
/me realises he has Heavy's Sasha
fuck that shit...
>self-programmed
i got a missile
When the homo sapiens started to roam the Earth, incest was rampant, and we're talking the father/mother/daughter/son/uncle/ect. Type
so basically, anyone you mate with is related to you...
Later on, the concept of "parentship" came forward: incest was then reserved to the same generation. Parental incest dissapeared almost completely, but sibling incest was very common
/me attaches Dash's spare jetpack to Sasha
...but what has incest to do with bestiality
/me does not need such a puny weapon
Dash: it's a likely possibility that a person is related really distantly to you. Remember, though, that the human race was distributed unevenly across the globe
hold on Bjornfot, getting there
true, true...
/me has very expensive bullets "fuck your one shot"
anyways
beastiality is just fucking wierd....
end of discussion
LOL
I change window to irc
good argument
first thing is see
"weird"
What about necrophilia?
04:37:01 < DashWithRainbows> beastiality is just fucking wierd....
/me does not care
Wat.jpg
this response was brought forth by a reason: to avoid abnormalities in the gene pool, for one, and for two, to actually bring more variety to the gene pools, resulting in offsprings more fit for survival
A woman with 2 heads is normal to some.
/me flips shit
>mfw coming back to #bronystate to see MobileDCD's posts
conversation over
lawl
well, this chat has seriously screwed up at some point
Basically, at first, the human race first concentrated on "quantity" of the production, while later, it focused on "quality".
natural progression, considering that death rates during the rising of our race were higher than 50%
Hey ponies what are we watching?
...how can we know any of that for sure?
thing is
wild mass guessing by so called scientists?
yes
wut
I think therefore I am right
Wow this chat is so fucking interesting!!
i mean, there couldn't have been many records where they like, wrote HEY WE LIKE INCEST MKAY
I am confuzzled
pshaw
By studying population patterns, evidence, and because it's manifested in pretty much every other living creature in the planet
the amount of fucks i give!
also brb food
Religion was essential to the development of human civilization, now it's outdated.
/me gives a fuck
^
NOT
lol
Poor Sakamoto.
*wtf-animeface*
wee wee
poke
Did my chat die?
no
nope...
/me "Let's never talk of this again."
back
Hiya DCD.
now we return to the main event!
k, so it's not slice of lice.
Whats the name of this anime?
Nichijou
>SLICE OF LICE
the argument that makes me not give any fucks about humanity
NI
CHI
JOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
yeah, religion made them taboos surge, but yeah, it's basically a preprogrammed response
First magic, then religion
DAAAWWWWW
AWW YEAH MAGIC
Science is next?
GASP
What comes after science?
also Bjornfot: "normal" is nothing more than a statistical concept people misuse and wield to justify cruelty
ya
Sanity is a one-trick pony, it only gives you one thing: Reality
Suddenly, pony chat is now philosophy
Magic, Science and Religion?
But when you're good and crazy, the sky's the limit!
The fuck did we turn into an Index chat now?
/me thinks this show will cause death
Well, logically, eventually Science will be irrelevant by that arguement, and thus we'll be onto the next stage. In the same way as leaving behind Magic and Religion.
Ponies has made me fear death. I can't die until after the show is cancelled.
"Normal" means "that which manifests itself in the area of a graph with the highest probability of an isolated occurence"
In other words, it basically means "most common aspect"
Science is magic
My goal in life is to become an erogenous cloud
No
Friendship is
sufficiently advanced technology (aka science) is indistinguishable from magic
Friendship is SCIENCE
I GOTZ A FEVER (no really it sucks) AND THE ONLY PERSCRIPTION IS MOAR PONIES
I don't view it like that, Bjornfot
/me is tapped out of ponies
however, the "normal", being a statistic measurement, only works for classifying isolated characteristics, and not for a whole being, specially as complex as the human race
You could search for a "normal" area for an isolated characteristic, but nothing more
BTW what are we watching?
Bebop is next
nichijou
I see I see
So, once our magic gets sufficiently advanced in a thousand years, will we be back at Religion again?
however....that means a simple thing. Nobody can truly be "normal", nor is fully not "normal"
going to refresh the stream here in a moment.
of course, dcd
/me agrees
Everybody is strange in some ways
common knowledge: "normal" does not exist and is not achievable
back up
Which episode?
3
Opposite is also true
hm
and yet, people keep calling out others saying they are not "normal"
Oh! Beautiful yet hypocritical species of mine!
yeah
we ar elike that
we're... human
'meh.
speak for your self.
if we listen to our instincts and emotions too much
In your striving for a commonly accepted standard, you blinded yourself to the fact that this is neither achievable nor desireable!
dem legs
if everyone used their brains instead, the world would be a better place
Enlightened Anarchy?
Truly, how lackluster life would be, should we all be equal beings cut from the same chipping block! Abhorrent existence!
Sux to be you all of existence would say
and yet, these classifications, like "that man is not normal", have no end in sight. Such is the curse of the nature of the emotional animal that is the homo sapiens.
and yes, DCD likes Victor Hugo's writing style
yes... go on...
but Bjornfot, I'm done
...
I've ranted for far too long XD
oh...
what
kay?
also food is here brb
so, what was your point?
or did you just feel like ranting?
video derp
wat
lawl
kat on kb
good evening gentlemen. what are we wathcing?
I have returned, my wounded arm healed

/me glances at Sumica

Depends on what you like

write me down as oficcially traumatized
Just watch and talk about it with other bronies, that's why we're here anyway
i listened to the german dub of mlp
well i have not even heard of this show, but still your better off in the main chat #bronystate
alright, i'll be there
this room is pretty much a help room that Veewave and i watch...

To bed!
And delicious, magical, science.

INTERNET HATE MACHINE
this is amusing
i need something amusing after that mental rape
back
Rgr
This I did not expect-- Cowboy Bebop?
is there anything known about the science of this series?
fallout lolol
/me "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."
that guy augmented?
also Bjornfot: my point is that these "normal" behaviors exhibit themselves due to human protection mechanisms
Cowboy Bebop? Really? I did not expect that.
you forgot the part where i showed you my empty table and said "here is where i could keep my fucks, if i gave any"
Quote some random guy on YT
looool
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO not the normal stuff again.
lol no securing line
he could have floated off into OUTER SPAAAAAAAAACE
And then I was like OATMEAL, are you crazy?
oh.
but since this is a charater with future storyline, it worked
YESH
hi everyone
Hallo thAr
Hi LordCelestia
Magnets: that's how it works
how everybody doin tonight?
Sudden disturbing mental image. FlutterFaye. DEFY anyone to realise that!
look! a classical deal standoff
IN SPACE
dat standoff
why, Veewave? Do you not enjoy a good philosophical discourse? Nothing is greater that trying to analyze human nature: that vast, endless, and hauntingly ephemeral metaphysical existence that is impossible to grasp.
For doing so, is an impossible yet possible dream, a beautiful maiden intoxicating us with the fragrance of her perfume
Oh hi DCD
dat 9mm in sci fi
ohai LordCelestian
I've heard this discussion with my friends before
^auto correct? haha
That's all.
BULLETS IN SPACE? What a contradiction
why does that gatling sound like lazers?
why dose a gun in space sound like any thing?
TRUE!
Whalers on the moon: a new discussion
Sinc when do lazers make sounds?
ALSO TRUE
bullets in space are ANYTHING BUT a contradiction
I hear they carry a harrrrrrpoooooon!
since star wars
well they wouldnt go very far
ballistics in zero grav is your friend
Oops my bad
your right
you must remember, however, that no two souls are identical, and no two viewpoints, exactly alike.
Some might believe the words of Voltaire and Rosseau, while others might dwell on the thought that we are sinister by the nature of our own conception.
THERE I SAID IT D':
in fact, james isaac newton is the meanest motherfucker in space
LOL SOUL
dat mass effect quote
truest words ever
so, will the mood ALWAYS be so casual in combat situations?
MobileDCD, messing with your mind ever eince ever
i mean, we had bullets, missiles, all that shit, to the music of a shopping mall
ok, it's 04:17, i should get some sleep
night, BronyState!
Night Bjornfot
*yawn* peace out folks.
Let your dreams be filled with troll
bye veewave
Perhaps, a soul is but a word we can use to describe the psyche. The essence of a person, if you will. Religious concepts do not weight on the identity of some.
hush now quiet now it's time to lay your sleepy head
This is okay, but Pony Bebop is better.
those james bond hands
yeh Kencolt but it's harder to remake the whole show with ponies then it is just the OP
Oh, I would PAY so see a whole Bebop ep with ponies!
/me really enjoys discussions of a deeper nature, as you can see
fuel? not a drop. oxygen? NOT A WORRY AT ALL
The Mushroom ep. HAS to be the mushroom ep.
O2 can be scrubed, fuel not so much.
but at one point you run out of it
and a tiny craft like that can only carry so much of it
That face just screams bad guy.
So does that one.
SALAD STAB
greenpeace of the future!
Greenpeace gone WRONG.
i already like that show
And here's where he gets screwed.
funny, no fuel
but still in orbit
He ALWAYS gets screwed.
LOW orbit
KNEW it.
dat product placement
Faye is such a halfwit...
you forgot to bring up power for heating Dark_Horst
Holy shit
I hate vectors
SO MUCH
the galaxy is safe with this guy
Over the barrell...
why do you hate vectors?
I just hate working with them
Either I don't know how they work
Or there's something wrong with my brain
FUCKIN VECTORS HOW DO THEY WORK
they make anything around them transparent
wasy as that
*easy as that
...dat airlock
Swirly.

quite stealthy for a giant tank spider
good shockaobsorbers?
look, android tits
Okay. Naked suicidal androids. Got it-- no, wait, I don't.
No no
It's obviously because the flux capacitor doesn't have enough SOlar energy because the holt member of kagatsushi passed out in the suntan area
It makes total sense
well okay, i see your point
BUT WHO WAS PLASMA INJECTOR?
Phone was
shiiiit
Or maybe it was Dari
If dari was phone I would squee.
He... he complimented me...

I think DCD is ignoring me.
DCD doesn't exist
That comment was a ghost
that wanted us to ship Twist and snails
Damn wispers in my ghost.
The evil ghost was merely using DCD's body
Or rather his account
Guys, not to interrupt, but this is SO epic and you should watch where I set it to start off. it's too epic to not watch twice

It's a cyborg thing.
YET THEY'RE JAPANESE
And then suddenly
WOT
My name now has 2 extra numbers
well its not like the japanese are going to draw themselves as asian stereotypes
"I will fight crime... BARE-ASS... before I fight crime in that thing." Quote from Hancock when Will Smith is offered a tight superhero suit.

Besides, face it-- the Major CAN pull that look off.

Boobs require food?
YOU'RE AN A FUCKING SPACESHIP

Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

Why do I suspect the guy with the girly hair is gonna be real important?
they're called A CREW
Cause the camera is on him the most?
The guy with girly hair is the main characteer
naw
He also sucks in SRTZ2
becasue he already built up sexual tension with a female character
Also he sucks*
that's as much of a dead givaway as a red uniform
Hey, a space colony within a glass dome, WHAT COULD POSIBLY GO WRONG?
Yes she just said he can fap to her if he wants.

Combustible lemons
GOLD bricks with lemons
It's not about Celly as Aramaki. It's about Twi in the Major's gear.
*brohoof*

HOLY FUCK
so the bisiohen takes his place.
i thought that dude with the green hair was a girls
In fact, that geat has an advantage-- it's high cut enough that her mark will show.
you are overthinking that Kencolt
I can't HELP it.
I was surprised about green hair on a guy as well.
True you do like her.
Great, I won't sleep tonight
you can never overthink twilight in other characters outfit
It just... just...WORKS.
Damnit Kencolt, I'll be thinking about that
so More macross?
aall night
it shouldn't but it sure does
so, why do you people like that show so much?
/me does a Pinkie Pie jumping fest. "It just works! It does it does it DOES!"
didn't look that compelling to me
....phone.... sure
Best phone ever
/me pants. "And a bikini. Just because. Even if there's no rational reason for her to wear one."
I can't sleep...
The dive helm too Kencolt?
man, i hate japanese intros
Why hORST?
dunno
Um... not sure about the helm...
allergic reaction, i guess
Is this like bronystates latenight squad?
But maybe a seifuku? So cute.
i mean, come on, it'S so... so.. JAPANESE
kinda
seen that already Kencolt
late night? that'S fun
Nah, we usualy watch DCD play SRTZ2

I like it
MUST SEE MUST SEE M<UST SEE!
spot the gay crewman
Can I train like that?
Please
that armor doesn't look protecting
usually, that'S the girl'S armor's job
it's a flight interface suit Dark_Horst
Oh, no armor that's worth anything LOOKS like it is.
that's why i like western sci-fi
I am sure you can find it if you try Kencolt
Skimpy is magic.
if western sci-fi gives you an interface, they give you neural helmet shit
not as bulky as this suit thingy
oh look, plot
...they're not letting that lkid into a 100 tons worth of battlemech?
tell me that they won't
Wow. OK-- Tei in both the Major's outfit and some of these...
They all have the same underwear.
dont make me get the hose Kencolt
Yeah. I'm Twilighyt opbsessed... why do you think I'm in this channel?
What's up with that?
pagent
...you're NOT in the twilight channel
It says I am.
huh
you are in both
i'm in the #bronystate
how come i see you

series about giant battlemechs in space ---> fashion show
Yep, that's a mecha anime for you
So... the new Miss Macross rules havee every girl in the same suit? Makes it fair, I guess...
the fuck was THAT thing?
vending machie
so the future has vedning machines with the abilities and mindsets of salesmen
indeed
... i'm getting a gun and a bullet tomorrow
I predict a major "Oh, Fuuuuuuuu" moment coming up...
AND THEN SUDDENLY A RED THING COMES
"sank you"
Mewmories of Robotech...
well this is robotech, er well robotech was a english remake of macross
so is that a race or a skirmish?
3 on 3
What I mean is, something is about to happen...
incoming song
ooooooh... so cute.
what are the bets that they DON'T use practice rounds?
lol
*headmic*
And so DUMB.
Oh GAWD-- even the idol singer outfit?
let me guess you want to see Twi in taht too =p
boy, these guys sure have good inertia dampening
No. I have more respect for her than that.
Who wouldn't like to see Twi in everything?
If I say I want to see Twilight in suggestive clothes
LOOK OUT, RUSSIANS!
Would that be weird?
Not the Ruskies!
I'm not saying suggestive== just attractive.
the majors outfit is both, I admit...
did't we cover the what is weird thing earlyer and end with it's all relitive.
sooooo... what are these red things anyway? aliens?
yes
mechs? big insects?
Yep
Dress up ponies, it's fine, not as if they normally wear anything anyway.
big bugs
Big insects would be correct
Who hate us.
wonderful
what show is this anyways?
/me is reminded of Gunbuster
Love and Tolerance does not, apparently come easily to the mind of giant space bugs.
huge insects with megahuge particle beam weapons
Macross Frontier
THAT'S evolution for ya
Dat delicious Klan
THAT is one HELL of a rack.
don't you think this character could use a liiitle more tits?

When in doubt, add more tits.

OK. I DO want to see TRwilight in the Zentraedi uniform!
Veewave: LOVE
/me does not judge Kencolt
it's where the ones with the odd hair colors go from normal sized to super sized.
I''m sorry. But5... well...
/me : Starflower: Much Love
It's cool ken

And now we wait for 2 weeks.
...Right?
WELP. this is an embarrassing point to have not been using headphones
3 seems morelikly
lol
i have... i have 7 or 8 blankets on my bed
i can't tell. they're just all lumped up
so for bed tonight. i'm probably just going to tunnel my way under them
oh boy Sugar Cubes again
have some more of the wrong ponies wille I go get some more ziacam
Oh hi GG
I hate how they discontinued the Pre 3 before it was even released :(
Or at least before it was released Stateside.
So acording to the guide 10/1 is ep 201 twice and 10/8 is ep 202 twice
the 15th will be ep 203
Really? For real?
Or is that your estimate?
yes
Does it say the name of the episode?
I am looking at my cable guide
It just list it as MLP ep 203
hey
Uggghh…why do they need to repeat part 1 and 2 over a two week period?!
was up
wait. two weeks till a new ep?
It's a great two-part episode…but damn…two weeks...
hello?
So the rest of the eps line up with the fall show starts
ctrlx: Unfortunately, yes.
:|
3 really
eh. i can live.
yah :D
But if those first two episodes are any indication of what's in store for Season 2, then this will be the best season EVER! :P
I am just wishing for more eps so people have more to work with on pmvs
i haven't had time to get attached to the new season yet
ctrlx: Episode 2 didn't win you over?
Kinda sick of "yay" 'louder"
At least Season 1 wasn't the final season of MLP
That would hurt…a lot
SuperBrony64, i love ponies. and i like the new season. but i've only seen ep2 once so far. i have to watch it again to get a feel for it and then i have to see the rest of the season to become attached to it
Oh god we have this on our playlist?
SuperBrony64, it won't be. but friendship is magic can only go so far.
ctrlx: Darn, no wonder why. You need to watch episode 2 AT LEAST three more times :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-Tc8y3Guo&feature=related
That's to get maximum Pony.
/me has watched 202 3 times already today.
/me brohoofs Sumica
Every showing keeps getting better and better
i'm downloading the ep right now actually
Awesome! On iTunes right?
i hate itunes
and have a strong detest for apple products in general
Uh-oh…that means you piratin'
ohgod 1080p version
tsk tsk
Do what you want cause a pirate be free
SuperBrony64, when you buy off itunes, you're killing the industry.
apple rapes artists
just donate directly
it's a good thing I count as a nealson family else mlp would be loosing viewers by watching our stream.
they actually get the money then
ctrlx: Not really, money goes to the animators still. I'd much rather buy them from iTunes than pirate them.
SuperBrony64, talking about itunes. ITUNES
Me too.
apple takes 99.99% of the money you pay
:P
ctrlx: No they don't.
pretty much
but they would get more if you just send them a paypal or something
and bypass the middleman
I dont think they are hurting for cash if FiM brought in 5 mill last year.
also what Sumica said
lol
They got a good portion of that money from iTunes I would suspect.
in fact I am sure that is why we have S2 and 3
i'm planning on buying some new merch
SuperBrony64, nobody uses itunes
merc mostly for what I read
and viewers on the hub
ctrlx: You don't use iTunes, but a lot of people actually use iTunes.
omg itunes is so horrible coded
But I mainly use Apple products anyway so it's no big deal.
Sure you noticed how much I hate not being able to use my prefered video player
apple might be ok. i don't like their products but other people can. that's cool. but itunes....is discord
Only reaision I have an I phone is cause i found one after a tech show at work.
put android on it
I've tried using a lot of other phones out on the market, but none were as good (IMO) as an iPhone.
I will say I like it but would not pay the price they ask for one.
not as good? or just different than what you were used to?
Not as good, interface was much slower, scrolling wasn't as natural, and there's no guarantee of apps working on a specific phone over another.
i hate the style and how you can't mess around under the hood but that's me.
The only other phone I would go for would be a Windows Phone 7
background programing s a bit bulky
i hate win7 phones
4 background programs in my taskmanager
I've used that and it's got an interface that is near as good as the iPHone
Sumica, for your desktop or phone?
SuperBrony64, it's just way too simple and restricted for me
so i can connect my phone to my PC
Sumica, do wat?
Sumica, memory on your desktop or on your phone?
on my PC
SuperBrony64, i never have a problem with stuff not working.
used to, though
3 i can close and one is only if I want to share music
I'm not saying other interfaces and apps don't work, I'm just saying it isn't as 'smooth' of an experience as I would like.
but it bugs me to have so much running in memory
especaly when streaming.
For example, the browser on Android doesn't have the same fluidity in scrolling and zooming that Safari does on the iPhone.
SuperBrony64, mine works fine on my tablet. scrolling and zooming are beautiful
my phone is an old android though. so it's stuttery
both are hacked up so they perform better than stock versions
The best thing I like about the iOS is the addition of iCloud in Apple's next update.
thought about jailbreaking mine but I dont want to brick it.
Sumica: You won't brick your iPhone haha
like google sync?
It's like Google Sync, except it's more involved.
I kinda want to click that table flip link
all i need are my contacts, dates, and whatnot
i handle files myself, since it's easy
iCloud does more with App data, Phone backup, etc. That's why I'm looking forward to it.
this video needs poneies
The biggest thing I hated was having to sync my phone to my computer to put new content onto it from iTunes
SuperBrony64, oh i have backup stuff like that already
But with iCloud, it does it over the internet.
oh this

discord
I'll just have to see what the iPad 3 offers when it comes out
should i get another ssd or double my ram?
Double your RAM
If you already have an SSD, bumping it up with slightly better specs won't make that big of a difference.
SuperBrony64, android tablets are pretty nice. different from phone android since they have more horsepower and some kernel differences
:3 16gb 1866mhz
I do like the Android tablets though. :P
SuperBrony64, i was gonna raid the two ssd's
My personal favorite is the Galaxy Tab 10.11
10.1*
honecomb tabs are nice
any tegra 2 tab will pwn
But I went with the HP TouchPad cause it dropped down to $150 :P
i've seen my tablet overclocked to 1.8ghz from 1ghz
<3 nvidia
bet that is a power drain.
ewwwwww x86?
IT depends if the processor is underclocked in the first place
;-;
But it will make a difference in battery life nevertheless.
the new psp is gonna have a quadcore arm from nvidia
excited to see that baby :3
I really want to get the PlayStation Vita
But 3-5 hours of Battery life hurts.
nah it's on-demand frequency scaling
so it'll only drain more if i'm actually using that much more power
It's the same as the 3DS, but I was hoping it would be better.
how did pennyarcade put it
8hours if it just sits there, 5min if you want to play a game
i only run 1.4
Haha, that sums it up.
and i get like 9 hours
since i got it all tweaked
nah mine can idle for at least a whole day
i haven't really tested it
doing something that pushes it to the max i get like 3-4 hours
Have to remember to turn off my wifi when I am not using it, kills my battery in like 3 hours
so an average day i get about 9 hours
but like i said i've tweaked it a lot
yep
wifi burns
bluetooth
power saving profiles
task killers
I jack work networks
a proper frequency scale scheduler
lol DCD must have added this one.
and then basic screen timeout, etc
to the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
you can boot backtrack5 on tablets now
0_o
You streamin' Sumica?
yes
it's the bronystate playlist
You should play my awesome playlist that I've been perfecting :P
not bad animation.
There's a hidden annotation on her tail near the middle of the video
It links to another video that's unlisted :P
FFFFFFFFthis cold.
I'll just leave my playlist here in case anyone's interested: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF62EACEFD4FD1533&feature=mh_lolz
:P
Although I've never actually linked a playlist before…so hopefully that's the right link...
Oh, and my nose is bleeding now
:S
looks like alot of the one I have seen at some point
Sumica: Maybe so, but it's now in one convenient location :P
My PL is in a fine location too =p
just need to split mine as it has things from before I became a Brony
Well good news then! My playlist has 99% Ponies :P
God I wish my new internets would be set up already.
dumb isp
What's your current ISP?
what name would you like? The one when I started with them or the current one =p
Century Link is the current name
I'm upset that a town that's near my home town is becoming a test market for some high speed internet
1 Gbps for $70 a month >:(
costly
But 1 Gbps
That's ungodly fast
yeah but who needs that much
Streamers :P
we pay $100 for 1.5mbit
that's just Dl speed
ctrlx: Is it satellite?
and have latencies 800+ on a regular basis
upload is never that fast
SuperBrony64, dsl is typically 3mbit
i'd like to host my own servers
I will be paying 50 for 15 down 1.5 up
cloud computing
SuperBrony64, you win!
It's testing some new equipment, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was near that speed for upload.
Sumica, depends on the connection. with fiber it would be
Lol, I did?!
true but most towns wont have fiber.
I'm paying $30 for 15-20 Mbps down
SuperBrony64, southern cali?
NorCal FTW
they are supposedly upgrading here soon for 100down
Woah. Sure is less people in here.
i have a feel that i am lagg
Noting realy going on on a saterday.
oh hey. xchat2 says 41s lag
that all
For some reason, I have this video repeating itself in the background: http://youtu.be/PH8jpLwt4W0
SuperBrony64, i knew they were testing fiber in cali
I may end up emulating my namesake against two of my roommates before the weekend is over.
I have started using xchats lag chat to help me know if I am stream lagging.
Sumica, it's a test thing to see if it's economically viable to give fiber for the masses
I see
ctrlx: Yup. Which is why I'm made my hometown isn't in the test market
mad*
I know my old HS had T3 set up neare the end
and this lagg is killing me so i'm going to bed. BED. under my blankets. A WHOLE PILE OF THEM
ctrlx: Have fun :P
Hmmm. Doctor who?
OH LORD
Dari Dose Dr who
I tend to do anime and Burnnotice
Hiccuping Pinkie is best Pinkie
but right now it's filler playlist cause i think i will go ptfo soon.
I have the distinct feeling I'm going to end up backhanding my roommate. :/
There are many things I'll put up with, but blatant disrespect is not one of them.
oro?
Spider_Jerusalem: He stealing your internet?
Oh boy!
oh man my ears dont need this >_<
inb4 9999999999999999
uuuuhhhhhhh
No, one of my roommates, who has yet to pay a dime to rent, has been trying to tell me what I can and can't do, in my own fucking apartment, in the most condescending disrespectful tones..
John Madden
He's from Alabama. Go fucking figure.
aeiou
5 across the eyes
Spider_Jerusalem: Smack him with a trout
5 across the eyes? That means pimp slap?
?!?!?!?!
brrbrbrbrbrbrbbrbrrbrbr
Hmm…that was enough spam for one night.
yes backhand em or just say gtfo
no rent payed and name not on the lease
I think that next time he starts it up, I'm going to look him dead in the eyes, and tell him that the next time he starts it up, I'm going to backhand the teeth out of his mouth.
And if he keeps it up.....
We must be in the same boat Spider_Jerusalem. I keep telling my roommate to change his ways and I don't pay him rent as well.
Michael?
just be mindfull of where you do it, dislocated a guys jaw with a knucke backhand.
*troll face*
Haha
Actually, my roommate pays me half of rent so we both on same page.
wait, are you guys roommates? =p
No, this is along the lines of him demanding that I stop what I'm doing and go hole up in my room so his guest can couch crash.
No.
Sumica: Lulz no
Just pulling a Discord
You know Derpy, Donut bar Chef, on Ponychan?
Spider_Jerusalem: Force your roommate to start paying rent if he wants you to change.
no I only hang here and eqd
He's my roommate. But not the bad one.
I have three roommates.
In a 2bed 2bath. :/
Force 'em all to pay rent or slap them with some trouts.
Derpy is fine.
ACtually, I'm not paying rent right now, due to being involved in legal matters against two seperate businesses.
I had a roomie that liked to go loose his pay check at the casinos before he got home.
But I also have the only working car, and constantly run people to and from. :/
I lose my paycheck to Ponies :/
first time he did't pay up I turned on the child lock on the cable box and set it to pbs
:P
Nah, I'm just kidding...
I don't get a paycheck :(
second time I told em to gtfo
Dis video
Sumica: Should've set it to The Hub. That'd show 'em…wait a minute...
nutron bomb ponyville
hub was't around back then.
if it was it was still discovery kids
Fluttershy is awesome!
Uh-oh, mods are here. Hide the ponies!
Wrex
Anywho.
Actually…I think his client just reset :P
But nevertheless…hide the Ponies...
Can't be too careful
Douche roommate demanded that I go to my room early, so his guest that he brounght over unannounced could sleep on my fucking couch.
This video is trolling
indeed
Tell him he's just in time for Pony videos
that is why i keep my system in my room.
Once I get a job, and sort my legal shit out, if he doesn't have a job, he's getting kicked the fuck out.
Sumica: To keep people away from the Ponies?
And I'll do it in the asshole way.
so I dont have to deal with people in my home
I'll wait until he's out at the karaoke bar, like every fucking week, with his friends, and pitch his shit outside, then lock the door
I'm the guy who will annoy the shit out of someone with Ponies if they annoy me :P
Spider_Jerusalem: Are you the only one on the lease?
I used to anoy friends with pony, then they became brony and said othere streams suck
Oh God Sumica, skip this video...
I kind like this vid
"Approved for all ages!"
NOOOOO
Nah
Me and derpy are on the lease.
in fact I am saving it to my random list
Douchebag and his girlfriend aren't.
Derpy, huh?
Derpy from ponychan
Anywho. Douchebags girlfriend is a long time friend of mine.
dis vid maeks mah brianmeatz hurt a lots
And I haven't told him to GTFO yet because she'd insist on moving too. And they don't have anywhere else to go at the moment.
this video is like somthing out of niconico
speaking of niconico
I do enjoy dem Ponies
Dis song
not a fan of this song.
You not awesome or something?
I think it's more we play it too often
If you don't drive your mom's ride, you not cool *puts on sunglasses at night*
If only there was someone elses playlist we could play to end this monotomy...
=p
I'll just push this on the table: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF62EACEFD4FD1533&feature=mh_lolz
Let the enticing fumes of its fresh baked goodness fill the room
have this random while i go look for some cough meds
No wait
NOOOO
*ears bleed*
i thought that linked me to my favorites lols
MeteorVenture: Does it? :P
Never linked a Playlist before
:S
nah it's a playlist
Hurray! Then we have success!
bleh this stuff is like cherry ass.
it just looked extremely similar to what my favorites probably look lik
like*
Oh Hi MeteorVenture
hey sumica:D
I could put one of Dari's nightmarefuel picks on repeat for you all =p
i just made a joke that took me like 10 minutes to make.. just for a simple comment.. WORTH IT
What's the joke?
http://www.facebook.com/BroniesCommunity/posts/253106294731527
Sumica: You wouldn't dare...
the comment there
man walks in to a bar, says ouch
first read the main post
i'm chunkatuff
I'm going to go have a smoke and make a sandwhich. If my roommate says a goddamned thing, I'm beating his ass.
Have fun storming the castle
hells yeah
DIS HOMEWORK (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
it took me a while to find the right emoticon lol but it paid off
Not to be mean…or dense…but I don't get it :S
My favorite joke
your hands hanve pinky fingers.. i wake up with 2 of them every morning
have*
"Hitler wasn't such a bad guy, after all he did kill Hitler"
How about this one
i would probably need to know more about hitler to get that one
he commited suaside
only spelled right
ah then ya
"My mate rang me and asked, "What're you doing at the moment?"
I said, "Probably failing my driving test.""
lol 2 letters off? close enough!
lol
it's late and I am on cold meds so my rubish spelling will only get worse.
MeteorVenture: Icwatudidthar
And your video selection choice! :O
:(
No hard feelings…FRIENDSHIP?
wait. what? lol
you looking through my favorites?
oki one last anime I think before bed.
(when you somehow found my youtube page)
You looking through MY favorites?!
Sumica: Yatterman!
dont have
YouTube it
how about we look through each others favorites?
culture!
Gunbuster…:<
but really if you wanted to that's an actual offer:P
wait.. is this your favorites?
or just a ponies playlist?
Okay. I'll share my favorites.
Fluttershy and Scootaloo
Now you share yours.
lol i mean like your favorites list on youtube
but i don't have favorites in that regard
Woah now, we just met
hey it's open to the public anyway:P
but i've been around here lol
Well, just check my YouTube page
k
It's the same as my username here :P
So what you dont like gunbuster?
i don't have favorite ponies btw.. i like em all basically
Sumica: I like One Piece and only One Piece.
feh
here's my account if you want to see my favorites http://www.youtube.com/user/chunktuff
as per part of the deal i guess i have to post my shamelessly self-promoted channel
Nickelodeon?
Woo
Douche roommate was in the bathroom
I didn't have to fuck him up
Spider_Jerusalem: Cause he already went to the bathroom…?
but serious.. why so serious?
Those Japanese anime girls and their skimpy outfits...
As in he was in the bathroom the entire time I was out of my room.
They make me angry.
Spider_Jerusalem: Oh! I see what you did there...
One reason I like One Piece is they make fun of anime stereotypes
Topless? really
Morning Guys
that's the English tey're going with
I'm going to bed soon :D
Yeah it's realy bad jinglish
*they're, dammit
you should totally watch the world god only knows
the double entendre can't be unintentional...
You will see
The other anime I really like is Yatterman, but that went away after a season or two :/
Starring the best character names ever!
Yatterman-1 and Yatterman-2!
This comic wins the most-depressing-comic-I've-seen-all-night award.

*BroNYCon

bRoNyCoN
(BroNYCon because of NYC)
Ack.
Let's play a game friends.
/me fires Chaos Rising up.
which game
It's a game I like to call, "Where the hell did Spider put his damn phone?"
I'm not doing too well right now.
I seem to be losing.
Badly.
Bathroom? I forgot quite a few things there
As I cannot find my damn phone
I'd suggest calling it but that requires having your phone...
is it your mobile or house phone?
mobile
call it with your housephone
http://i.imgur.com/nbZKt.jpg
point goes to Mantis
Well. It's dead.
And I have no House Phone
I think it's time to go "Accidentally" wake douche roommate up.
Fuck! I have a long day of busting my ass ahead of me, and that phone's got my music on it!
AHA!
SPIDER FOUND HIS PHONE!
^flawless victory
Not really.
It was on my bed the entire time, while I turned my room upside down..
It was under a pillow
/me *facehoof*
XD
For my shame, I shall go brew coffee... Without turning the grinder function off.
/me drinks coffee
How do you take your coffee?
much sugar
but sometimes black
Hudson is aweseom
new best pony stats are available
https://gist.github.com/e49da2478f847df04df5
Apple Jack is least liked
I think we all saw that coming.
derpy is less liked than discord?
discord is better liked than twilight XD
I'm sorry, but where the fuck is Tom?
(where is flutterbitch too!)
Tom is too awesome for the list
08,1:<
new list is being generated
thanks to awesome Kabaka
Tom will be on it
Tom will be the only one on it. XD
something tell me Tom will be better liked than applejack
Tom is a ROCK! A beautiful, beautyful Rock
he should be on zeroth on the list
and here is the new list
https://gist.github.com/329a63cbbc7c8f8348c9
it seems like tom is better liked than flutterbitch
I heard Discord was ground up into cupcakes
Discord as an ingredient would probably give you Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Cupcakes...
so he would troll ponies from the grave
And only the worst flavours too
i would love if a less powerful Discord could appear like Q and troll Twilight out of boredom
Where can I find fanfics of Big Mac and Twilight
;D
The clopfic repository.
i was gonna say...
that sounds too..... cloppy for me
eeyup
Also. Hell yeah Flutterbitch.
You gave me the wingest boner.
where are those numbers coming from? that was fast
How many ponies were in the chat on the stream yesterday?
i heard 1600+
:O
over double the S1/Basil34 days
One of the writers should be paid for an official book
just on Fluttershy
Hey guys
Oh hey... I'm just stepping back now...
huh?
LordCelestia you must be in a good mood today! :D
Well, why wouldn'tI be?
I don't know, sometimes you send people to the moon
But I'm sure for good reasons
Ooooh, I'm just foolin around. It's a thing I do
I'm not even a mod so i cant technically do anything :p
phew
When were you here that I was sending people to the moon? I'm on here every day at some point.
whoops ^
I am also Hat!
Oh, hey hat! didnt recognize you obviously
LordCelestia, My liege
I don't know why
:P

TIME FOR A TALE OF HILARITY!
So.
Yeah I see it fine
moar phone shenanigans?
I can't see the stream
Yesterday, I was talking to my parents. In conversation, I mentioned that an Irish pub was opening up near my house.
Oh I see it now
Out of nowhere, my parents told me "Hey, you should be a bartender. We'll pay for the school."
the school?
Yeah.
Bartending school.

ok whats going on now? Now it's not streaming
Interesting
ITs over I think
sorry, gotta go now, can't stream for a while
and who will stream?
okay, thanks for the entertainment
I would stream if I could download stuff to this computer
but I can't download stuff to this computer
I can stream but its okay if you don't let me
I would probably show everyone all types of headgear
It's not really up to me. I'm not a moderator. I'm hoping to be one someday
You have this anonymous brony's support
Thanks,
very interesting...
OMC
I have to get up at 1 oclock tomorrow
and I assume there's a completely different site with a BronyState password for streamers to access.
I think thats how it works at least.
OMC? huh?
What for?
something other than bronystate :/
that smiley looks presumptious
Yeah, it looks nothing like :/
wait a minute
...
Ohai everypony
hello Pegacorn?
Aren't pegasus and unicorns called Alicorns? hehe
.........If only you knew how many times i was asked that.
Don't forgot they also have Earth Pony properties!
True, I am quite strong.
Are we allowed links
They usually don't like it whiloe streaming. I would allow youtube links and image links.
I AM PUNCHING YOUR SALAD
Noooooooo
nice
Did I ever show you my fanfic im writing?
No :o
now i have a s2 ep 2 plot count =D

Thats the prologue

/me throws a train at Pegacorn
/me gets hit by the train
2 trains in one? Thats impressive!
Fluttershy` you can throw a train? Damn you strong!
/me grins. "Screw gravity!" WHOOOP
/me : :D
There's something on your face!
/me punches Pegacorn
08,1IT WAS PAIN
lol reversed tactics ftw
Now Fluttershy' don't touch that cactus.

i liked your fanfic LordCelestia, it reads very smoothly
^ thanks
Can I make a couple of suggestions
Die potato!
sure
Maybe Twilight could have read about humans in a history book which makes her less surprised. At the moment she takes meeting an alien very calmly
I like trains.
She doesnt know right away that he's an alien.
Ah I see
Nice story!
Its like seeing a new animal. But talking creatures aren't new to them. Like the dragons
or buffalo
Oui
they all talk too
Hey, Pegacorn, where do YOU wanna go when you grow up?

/me pokes the chat
hey Derm#
Cheese?
OMG I LOVED THAT
someone 6pooled?
I was saying that in the stream during this episode
its a BIG... BEAUTIFUL... OLD... ROCK
the pioneers used to ride these for MILES!
The Giant Rock of DESTINY?
and its in GREAT shape!
brb guys, gotta go eat some lunch
k
/me continues munching on pizza
Flaschen,you win for bringing back my childhood.
yeah. don't know how I got a hold on it *LierJack face*
IT'S A ROCK!
love the timing on that bit
THE PIONEERS USED TO RIDE THESE BABIES FOR MILES,AND ITS IN GREAT SHAPE!
Tom is our Destiny!
Lead us Tom!
TOM
Tom is better than best pony, He's bestest Pony
Sorry,but Megatron is best pony.
He is the Über Pony.
MegatronXPinkiePie
search your feelings, you know it to be true
Flaschen,YOU ARE WIN
Megatron is propably a brony
What about Magneto?
He is best Magnet
Magneto and Megatron tie for best pony.
Which version of Megatron?
Prime
Prime AND G1.
Long Live Frank Walker (he was also in the G1 Pony movie I think)
FRANK WELKER IS BAWS
I don't know, the Beast Wars Megatron was fun.
/me Slams trout on his head since he messed up Welker's name
Yeees
ssss
BWMegs had a Rubber Ducky (which was propably the real Leader)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5KA8kmlfQs
ARE YOU READY FOR THE HOT NUTS
Are you ready for the Fireflies in the Sky
/me is propably wrong
I see that Espy is a Transformers fan.
Of course.
Always good to have a Transformers fan around.
we need a whooves ep with Ditzy/Derpy as extra
Did you two also love the 80s movie of TF
/me has that on DVD
But of course.
Look out,here comes Megatron!
/me pushes Megatron into the chat
/me still refers to The Touch as the best power-up song ever
One of these days, I'll get a proper Optimus Prime toy.
The Touch=Best movie song EVER.
I like Zoids more than Transmorphers
Pegacorn: GO-BOTS
**** Michael Bay
Heh
>_>
/me hides the bayformers dvds
Michael Bay is a terrible person.
Bayformer's Optimus Prime is awesome though
I went into the theatre expecting giant transforming robots beating the tar out of each other. And that's what I got.
say what you want, what he did right was just incredibly good
Bumblebee was awesome too.
And the second movie had even /more/ giant transforming robots beating the tar out of each other.
Jetfire was best.
and the third had an hour of giant robots beating the tar out of each other
DE has now the Word
Nope.The second one had Megan Fox showing her ass and two dogs humping.And also Devastator showing off his balls.
3...ok..
BIRD IS THE WORD
3Pegacorn...I dont even want to know what the hell you are talking about
It did?
Huh. I must have missed it with all the fighting.
Son,i was talking about Bayformers.
Yes, I know.
I personally can't believe that Megan Fox refused to gain a few pounds above starvation for the role
BTW,when i said son,i was talking about Denied_Existence.
Ah. I can barely read Denied_Existence's text. Dark text + Dark background = pain to read.
Morning Luna.
3My green is dark?
thanks to DJ Dash3r i now think of Twilight picking up some Artifact that makes her an Alicorn for a short time
07,1morning Espy
07,1good to see you again
Hello Luna
Ohai Luna
07,1hello Flasch & Pega
/me welcomes Luna with a friendly hug
07,1hmm someone tried to steal my nickname...
Espy, Pega I personally loved the original Cartoon, and you?
It has a special place in my heart.
Looking back at it now, applying the standards of today? It's crap designed to sell toys. I still loved it though ^_^
do you have a favourite TF?
G1 is one of the best series from my childhood.
Personal favorite Transformer series is Beast Wars / Beast Machines
Dinobot's "Code of Hero" episode was wonderful.
I thought Prime, BB, Devastator and the Dinobots were the best
3Sadly I will not be able to be on here much until friday :(
Dinobot in BW was awesome too
NOOOOOOOOOooooooooooo~!
"A stick? Against a transmetal?"
07,1how are you all today?
now to wait 21 days for S2E3
"Broken, damaged beyond repair. Beaten. What can you possibly hope to do?" "Improvise."
good, and yourself Luna
07,1enjoying my lazy Sunday
3Wait...is it 21 days or just 14 days?
IMPROVISE
And thusly, Megatron is defeated by a Stick with a Rock on the end.
07,1ripping House to have it ready for streaming next week
next week S2E1, After that S2E2
MEGATRON IS BABY
the week after THAT S2E3
He had a Transmetal!Rubber Ducky. your argument is invalid
also DE that's what it said on EqD
3You can just see them on youtube...
I'm just repeating them
facts
The characters on Beast Wars were great. Rhinox saves everyone.
3...wait....how are they facts when I myself have seen both S2E1 and S2E2 in the past two weeks....
They repeat them on the Hub apparently
Gonna go play on Steam.Seeya everypony!
Hopefully I'm just wrong
3Wait...ok, you are confusing me....what exactly are you waiting for then?
in 21 days is the premiere of S2E3
3I thought the gap was only one week long
if I'm correct (hopefully not)
Hello bronystate
3Hello Apokalipse.
Not a very talkative chat today I see
07,1hello Apokalipse
07,1great to see you again
Hello Luna. Great to see you too
Hello Apokalipse
Isn't that a song?
It's also an animated movie
And it was selected on the lottery
07,1I did not, I do like the beatles though
Well there's plenty of beatles songs in it
07,1but i'm not sure it will beat RHPS ±P
07,1damn keyboard! >:
Well the pop art animation is interesting to look at
It's a vary strange movie though
very*
It's a perfect BMN movie
plenty to talk about
07,1as long as it's not something like....babes in toyland...
Haven't seen that yet, but considering what everyone says about it then it's miles better
charlotte's web?
only one movie?
or what's the other one
Incredibles I think
07,1you do know we won't air them next week?
Yes I do
