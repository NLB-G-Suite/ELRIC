Damn it.
10also
10I like how we've influenced you into using the 'me and soi' crying face
10with the ever extending "________"
10how cute
...
>_>
Well I influenced you.
10>_________>
Into
:>
:<
10not singing?
No.
I can't influence you into singing.
At least it seems to make the Wi-Fi auto reconnect somehow.
I have to leverage you into it.
>_>
:<
/me noms
._.
10trololo implying you can get leverage
10:>
13Wait, do you eat yoghurt or drink it?
>implying I don't have leverage
o.o
naughty zoroark
eat
I don't do either *shudders*
it's too solid to drink, or at leat for me
XD
not yogurt
10>implying there will ever be a practical -and- effective time to use it
/me runs away
On a tablet, the Wi-Fi periodically disconnects for no reason.
timeouts?
>implying I won't just get as many people on movie night as possible to see it.
10during a BMN?
I may not be able to post them here.
10exactly ;)
But what I can do is tell as many people as possible to go to another channel.
And post them there.
:>
10nor link to them without like a different hostname
Yeah I'm not sure why.
I don't need a different hostname.
10cause if someone links to a place with confirmed rule 34 while knowing it, the mods will get suspicious
It just seems to lose sign a
l somehow
10if it's your hostname
10and/or just pissed off
>implying I won't say I'm gunna post something NSFW.
10why would people open it?
You underestimate what I'm willing to do to hear you sing.
It's called morbid curiosity dude.
Novi: ;)
10shit true
10wellllllllllllll
10hm
10XD
uhhh :O wat :O?
Especially if I say it's R34 of a mod.
10also implying those pics are actually -really- leverage tbh
10lawdy~
One mod in particular.
;2,15)
10best mod
10<-
Best mod would sing for viewers.

10best mod doesn't need to prove himself by singing
10best mod is best mod inherently
Lies.
Best mod is earnt.
:P
wait so what about hipster? :P
/me snickers
*trollface*
10trolololo
10;D
I don't understand?
XD
>implying best mod was not in this chat
Usually I have to go to settings to reconnect, I suppose this is more convenient.
and thus trolling
10he was saying we were referring to Hipster as best mod
Oh.
10silly pony
>implying either RBD or I care about being best mod
10^
What kind of tablet
You need to go deeper, Val.

04hey

Dari, can you teach MirthTinker some tricks on control and dominance?
10haha, sounds like an average saturday afternoon in reading tbh
Who would you like to be unceremoniously facefucked by?
Probably.
Also, more Durrgan?
10I would say SoiPony, but dari would quote it, innit
There'll be people around us, they'll just be getting stabbed with different kind of knives.
10also: not gay
yfw knives are toys to me
10yfw this country isn't silly enough to legalise guns:D
show me a semi-auto, then i get nervous
I suppose.
Can't remember where the link to the game is though.
silly? but then how will i open beer cans
Supposedly my friends found an out of use warehouse which had a crate in it with smoke grenades and a gun.
Not sure whether to believe that or not.

12Nope
RodBroDash, you're so right

YouTube needs to start requiring some actual proof from people who flag videos for DMCA
Tits
hotrod are inherently dirty
It's too easy to troll YouTube by claiming to be from a copyright holder.

Ziltoid: it's a 4chan meme.

Fire
that's fire
10"Refers to the black vans that many US Federal agencies use when surveiling or arresting suspects. To be "v&" or "vanned" means receiving a visit from the party van which inevitably results in an arrest, specifically by shadowy, federal authorities. No one wants to visit the party van."
Heya DRF
And lol typoes

10I live in a party van
03yay, got my $20 iTunes credit

03Nice
03what made you decide to return?
2I don't really know
`\(°.o)/´

Astronauts save Luna what
Water Temple is best temple.

2Think I pressed the wrong button..
the water temple is terrible
2I was always good at that
it's 50% weak to electriciy
I always heard it was so hard, but it didn't seem that much harder to me...
2Is that Feather I see owo
try it on Master's Quest
Deugan is ALWAYS highest level fro some reason
03yeah, but she's always idle
2Ah
Wish I played masters quest
2Not spoken to her in a good while
Never got the chance
it doulbes the cost, halves the damage, but hits ALL enemies
they are a key ingredient in lip balm
lol
hey, you got 3 of those things you'll never use until they are useless
/me sets new alarm, tries to get classic rock station to come in
make sure you pay attention to the 'Turn Order' bar at the top; if you focus on killing upcoming targets, you can reduce damage to the party
she can regain mana by melee attacking
there is another who uses those weapons as well
a wallet
a watch
waffles
i love how i'm the only one talking...
if Dari wasn't talking, i'd feel lonely
talkytalky
*sniff* i'm so alone...

You were right. :3
I appreciate all beauty
2I was?
drop M DMG and pick it up
at least until mastered
Yeah, rather quiet..
03o.o what
it's okay to take downgrades for a time
it's only 10 attacks on Emela, it'll be fine
I still wonder what the person in charge of doing the MLP: FiM facebook updates thought the first time s/he saw a bunch of bronies commenting.
2All chats get there quiet times, Zem >w>
Also, have you guys seen the dinkypage?
What, about anonymous?
no idea. and yes, the Anon attack?
yeah
It's been a long time, don't blame me. ^^;
I lol'd for some reason when I saw it

12maybe more
2Sounds about right owo
2Loooong time
the total HP of enemies varies based upon a simple level matrix
12i see
Base HP + Level x Upgrade Rate
2How are you?
12frustrated
12o-o
each enemy has it's own formula; stats vary with it as well
2Aww D:

2I have a pound sign there.. xD
Faaaaiill
Silly keyboards
Just copy and paste it off of the internet
pffffft. stats are for pussies
2Yeah I'll have to
2I know there's a button combination for it though..
What kind of keyboard do you have anyway?
i think there is a valuable weapon or armor left to find, besides that sword
it's been a while, so i forget
2Oops I just joined channel
... yeahhh
2I still fail after all these years
Manaberries used to have a different description before Chapter 3 caused major updates to all 3 parts; It used to be 2 berries, and it said "eating these highly suggestive berries will... etc."
That's one thing that will never change~
03LOL
Chapter 21? OH MAH GAWD
Once you're like a Demi-God or whatever, do you get the attack Mollywhop?
2Shhhh you
... sure, why not
Cause that would be awesome
Antipodes is apparently on par with Past Sins (neither of which i've read)
12hmm
also, the author comes on here quite often
It's not hard to be on par with Past Sins
he even hung out last Friday
2hmm
Not that I'm dissing the author of Antipodes
EdwardNewgate, ouch
Just saying. and Dari, WWHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
No fanfics, AT ALL?
EVER?
of course, i don't have opinion of it yet; I just know i'm going to go fangasm over Nyx if she is as they say
She'll have to beat little Midnight first though; that filly has my OC heart
!umbreon
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 10 minutes

12nooo
;3
2Good ol commands 8D
Cupcakes, so sweet and tasy, Cupcakes, don't be too hasty
Pffft. No one can beat Little Pip in my heart
2I remember how we used to abuse Darkness's ones
But Silvermare is a close second
^
Dammit!
/me 2runs

<.<
The one above that!
I'm okay with this
03LOL
Rainbow Dash is... honestly, kinda last place
03Yeah, well, script abuse isn't funny :|
2Nope
Absolutely not, Pip is SO much better
...
but i totally got shipped to taht
2But we were silly/daft people back then D8
03yep
i'm sorry, but she was my canonical first ship
2Don't worry I don't plan on doing so anymore xD
2But do any of Darkness's ones still work?
Durrgan, OH YOU
I really can't pick an OTP
One of my RL friends who is a brony has fluttermac
whats everybody doing?
/me 10is back
I can, for whatever reason AppleDash is my OTP
My somehow-favorite ship is TrixShy
2Playing HeartGold and catching up with old friends
and Fluttermac is a very popular straight ship
I prefer Rarijack, but I have no problem accepting Appledash
some famous titles use it
Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash
Best ship. ^
2Hi
heya J!
Rarijack was my first ship ever
So clearly, Rarijack isn't an OTP
Strait shipping was best ship
hello there. welcome :)
what is OTP
Isn't there a clopfic about DashXDash clones?
One True Pair
heya!
... probably, Edward
thanks Freeze
There's a clopfic and a non-clopfic. That aren't related
You know what, there is. It's on my computer
2Say... is 'meep' still a common phrase here?
03yes
Yes
Sadly :P
Poison: Deals 5% of max health every round
03xD
i say it
...not that I, read clopfics or anything
2Didn't think that would ever change xD
we all do EdwardNewgate, don't worry. Except dari, he's... CLEAN
SilverMane: I shall join dari in that category.
just wait for Mardek to become OP WTF Roflsauce
Also, Twilight x Book is canon OTP http://i.imgur.com/Ifvrj.gif
Did you just say enema?
oh yeah, so crazyi f you did that dari
FAILSAR
lawl, poison ftw
check to see if you found all chests; then light thingy
Also, I really only like ships that make sense to me. For any fics I read
Exactly, Edward
same EdwardNewgate; i hate 'I just met you, and i Love you' shipping
My biggest thing with shipping is if it's well done.
Trixshy is my favorite, replacing Twixie, due to exactly ONE fanfic
12defrag taking ages
Like I like AppleDash because it makes sense the most
2D:
and Twixie held that spot for almost my entier fanfic career
03defrag always takes ages
12lol
12considering i just uninstalled steam and tf2
And?
I like Rarijack because of the fact that those fanfics are few and far between, and they tend to develop the relationship really well.
Rarijack makes sense too, but AppleDash seems more fan-approved
03yay
Lo all
03finally some sensibility
FreezeFrame, Swayback Mountain much?
Good!
hello Sumica
Hey Sumica
03^
Hello

One down, half a community to go
12it's still on this one
12XD
..oh
03LOL HML
i like this plan, Dari
Darn
;.;
although i know of a Twilight x Trixie x Luna
and it was GOOD
12i want to get this other laptop ready for going to college and using it
12so that means hiding all my pokemon stuff XD
and then Trixie was pregnant somehow
Twilixie?
lol wut
Polyamory? In MLP? It's more likely than you think. :P
How good?
lawl
2Ohlol
drf went to college & didn't hide his pokemanz
/me stumbles over current conversation.
But didn't you see that comic
Ow. Damn word stream.
clopclopclop
12this is la crosse
03xd
03*XD
EdwardNewgate, the original story was so good, it has fanfics about it.
College and Pokemanz arethe best fit :P
2Yeah at my collage everyone was pokemon mad
12liking pokemon is met with stabbings in the parking lot
12XD
also, he doesn't even need pre-readers on EQD anymore to get uploaded
That sounds good
Out in the Cold

My favorite ship is gummy x pinkie pie
man, i hope reticentsmolder/mirthtinker is alright; haven't seen hide or tail of him/her today
Gold Guest then?
12at least i can spell February
Because some are very good
Oh the irony.
LAWL
12which is like the top 5 most misspelled words in the english language
yfw those are green
Because some published books are fanfics
12that and Wednesday
hi hi!
Perfect timing Silvermane. :p
Wednesday
i know right?
NES in wednesday :p
Your old site was hacked by Anonymous?
Marry a NES day
Hrm
I think of wednesday as "wed-nes-day
"
Not ours.
the hole Dinkypage did
12yeah
Just dinkypage was being used for anonymous.
dinkypage
2Same here
because I'm such a nintendo geek
XD
To hack stuff.
will the hacking affect friday night's livestream?
i LOVE crying from stories; sadfics make me happier overall
12wedding ness day
No.
2xD
It's nothing to do with us.
12Feather's favorite day
Nothing at all.
ewww no
4chan is on the warpath lately.
It's like I'm wearing nothing at all
Heloooooo
(it was my fault. sorry, i said they were losers who couldn't hack shit)
well, I have a hard time seeing how people won't be concerned when they try to come here and get a redirect by dinkypage saying they were hacked
/me gives Kosoveon a memory foam bed
Immature kids at war. Sad.
there life sucks making his better by comparsion perhaps?
2I need one of those...
/me ^_^
I enjoy an occassional sad fic

/me floofs Umbreon as a result
Severe immaturity is why I don't go to chans. I've been reminded that today.
12o-o
@EdwardNewgate you'd enjoy Last Man Standing then, its a conversion bureau spinoff, but the best of the bunch
12Bluewing
12the one you aren't sleeping in
probably why i listen to others problems so much
ooo, that one made me bawl my eyes out
it hurts to see them in pain, but the helping feels good; as does the listening
Sounds good
2Yes..
Conversion Bureau... i really need to read that one
dari just needs love
yeah...there are a lot of points in the story that hit you in the get
Man.
2All the beds I've had I wake up in pain D;
Honestly, I like a good sappy lovey-dovey fic
The problem is so few are done well
@SilverMane the main story was never finished, but it spawned several excellent spinoffs
But you read them so well =p
they're both shortish
Pony Psychology is also worth a look for sadfic fix
12that's why you don't sleep in a bed
12and they don't cause you harm anymore
So, write your own fic
12the floor does
2owo
2Floors do too >w>
o.o *tackles bluewing!
12lol
Give him an amazing horse.
You're not supposed too
2Hi Nick owo
/me makes Nick play League of Legends
where do you keeo going!?
look at my horse, my horse is amazing
12to find darkness!
Give it a lick
2Me?
Of Mare's and Magic's original ending was PERFECT, and it was a worthwhile read; i disliked the epilogues fix for the ending, but i was happy for it going that way
/me brohoofs ReticentSmolder
it tastes just like raisins
2Long vacations
Silvermane out of everything, what is your OTP?
Have some lemonade.
easy jet?
/me runs
I foget the next line
2Ha we actually have those here now
With a brush of its mane?
so do I :D
I almost cried at the original ending of of Mares and Magic; glad it changed
Sure you have all read it already but I just started Past Sins.
It turns into a plane
EdwardNewgate... my favorite atm is Trixshy, although that's only as long as Kindness's Reward keeps it's place of honor. It used to be twixie, but that's still toppish
Razyn, it was how it should have ended
Sumica: Just finished it.
2They actually managed to fit another plane into Jersey's airport without another falling off the end of the island
I meant outside of MLP
Well, "finished" it.
I don't get all the popular fics with Trixie.
Trixie sucks.
And that ending hurt but... it was perfect.
WHAT
Like mine is RonXShego from Kim Possible
Hallo all
Trixie on the SHOW sucked; in fanfic we explore her character and find reasons to love her
There are some damn good fics of it
hai barry
hello Barry
ohai Barry
Yeah, but I only consider canon stuff.
hello Baaaary
Like of Two Minds?
All the built up personality in fanfics I disregard.
Which is why Luna sucks.
typy typy
Because she has one line and no personality.
:P
There's very little canon personality right now
if you only consider canon, then of course fanfic is useless
heh
Dari, that should change in Season 2
But that's what makes her character great. You can do pretty much anything with her
LOL SHAFT OF LIGHT
well its nice to see you back ;)]
Ziltoid already did
2Thanks :3
My shaft is made of light
Personally, I'm hoping for an entire episode detailing her backstory, up to her transformation into Nightmare Moon
mfw when prankster Luna is canon

I saw that on TV days ago.
A few times.
Why is there a little girl in that advert? This show isn't for them.
Notice two things.

A. White Celestia.
I know right?
B. ALL ponies are now princesses.
WAIT WHAT
I swear the Celestia isn't proper white.
Still pink tinted.
play it again wasnt here
dari, the show version has pink edges
It's not as bad as that one commercial that claimed Celestia was the only princess
HHHHNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGG
how do you think they could include that in the toys?
So?
You can't see the pink edges much.
you still can
they have the jewelry from EPISODE 1!
Yeah, but Hasbro obviously doesn't know anything about governments.
You can't seem them at ALL there.
Lol.
It should just be white.
Not pink tint.
It looks like shit still.
:P
Pink Celestia = Sunburnt Celestia.
My take on it.

hey
she has a summer castle in the Caymans

There are a shitload of girl toy commercials all over the cartoon channels. MLP is going to pop up there eventually (like it did).

if you have any serious 'must know answers in guidebook quality' questions, you can refer to the site fighunter.com and go to the wikia section
it's basically full of EVERYTHING about the game; bios, background, stats, locations, strategies, dialogue scripts, etc
Why are you talking to that Bloke?
zak looks like he has a peg leg.
Awwwwwww, he has no friends
I'll be his friend
hire Zak
bookcases. the most useless of all RPG paraphernalia
What is every one is this bare name Bloke?
er bar*
Look at all those Blokes
Bookcases are awesomesauce. full of random knowledge; and bloke is a title, not a name
man these blokes are slohed
so raceist
BLACK SNOOTY
What the fuck
toldja they were useless!
You can't read bookcases
You read books
...or maybe it's a secret entrance to something then, if you can normally read them in this game.
zach has no mouth
he probably missed that one. fighunter did the WHOLE game on his own, music and all
kick his ass
depends
no, you have to haggle!
it's good to get him early so that you can get him skills now
alright. you get a 5th party member later, but max combat party size is 4
so you may have to juggle a bit; try to balance skill progress between all 5.
good lord
I still say it looks like he has a peg leg.
Zach is a non-magical warrior; he has various offensive skills and uses a powerful weapon
he also can put himself into a rage
Of course it's because he's black
no raceist would be saying to put him in the back row
or I guess cause it's combat put him in front.
sprite?
Spirit
SPR=Spirit silly
and Don't sell any monster loot, like drills or wings
they are uber-useful in chapter 3
sprit is usealy like mana regen.
there are way tooo many people in that house.
there's one woman in this house? where is she?
oh that lady
Only woman and she's naked
Who needs clothes?
All these chaps.
if you say so lady
Wait, I just want to fuck you
a dozen Chaps and a Girl.
/me is laughing for real right now
i LOVE this game so much
i'd seriously pay money for this trilogy
this game is so random.
And then they fucked?
FigHunter is a crazy man who made a 60-hour RPG (chapter 3 of this) on his own, music graphics and all
is the trilogy complete, or is more coming out in the distant vague future?
so like Zun with less moe?
YALORT backwards is TROLAY.
ROYALT
GGgala_, the game is planned to ahve 8 chapters
but he mentioned it might be less than that
ah
each chapter is its own game, and save files transfer between them
at this point i would not be supprised to have a person in that town great you Pinkie pie style.
inb4 zombies invade necrophiliac ladies town
seems like it might be done by 2021 at the current rate
>chapter 2, 2007. chapter 3, 2010.
lol, he's taking a break from Mardek
^
He did.
/me derpface
a large part of chapter 3's length was that he completely overhauled the combat system
he redid graphics, updated both chapter 1 and 2, edited all items, altered all equipment systems, removed the #dx damage system, etc etc
created almost 100 songs on his own for teh game as well
Was this translated poorly from another language?
much of the game is written poorly on purpose, to recreate accents and moronic characters
I agree !
you know how well it is written when you read the books and talk to the intelligent character
's
these names...
mfw wifetta
Husbert
these names warrant the creation of an evil me...
He had dozens of names to come up with; can't be a gem each time
should have been Dautera
also, return to talk to Elwyen whenever you can; she has a present for you at some point

Beserk increases his damage by about 50%, and since he doesn't do anything else yet, that's fine
ah, guess I have played too much FF.
Beserk tens to result in the party member kicking his own ass more often then not.
no, FF Berserk makes you stronger too, doesn't it?
yes but you cant control what who the target is.

Yeah.
Reaction skills gain AP via usage; every attack or defense that has a succesful reaction gives 1 ap to coresponding skills. Defending a melee attack gives 1 ap to all melee defense reactions, etc etc for magic

Emela can gain MP by melee attackin
I'll be over here
That's FLAC format
the bitrate gets up to 6000
crazy shit
Even so that still isn't as long as the track I have
I wasn't going for length
If I had the file I have in that same FLAC format it would be around 2-3GB lol
but this is straight from the BD
:(
if it deals 0 damage, the total defense must be too high against it. typically a defense of 30 against melee or magic means immune to that attack type
And you wonder why you don't score...
LOL

lmao

mIRC is easy as hell
03LOL wut
saves me the problem of programming an IRC interface
I use a minimalistic libary for the network stuff, nick handling and triggers.. the rest's mine.
and I just finished the first rough sketch of my userinfo database.
now to syntax-check the code..
yay for implementing a simple dry-run debug mode.
heh, I periodically maul myself
with some of the mIRCscript I do

even though it would be easier for me to add a few nicks and make it halt when I use those nicks, but THIS KEYBOARD AND NO MOUSE - I'LL WAIT UNTIL I GET HOME
lmfao
and obviously this nick implies SUDDEN afk-ery. Not really today as it's still like preperation and such but oh well~~

06And, how are you all? =o
02In hell
Ima be good, not countimg the 3G
06o.O
06Why's that Ray?
02Because I'm bored :D
06oh of course
06speedtest tiem due to school
02Good luck(?)
04back
06Drakes
04heya Xeli
06besides the ping... my connection at home is faster o.o
Its a schoo
What did you expect
06Well it used to be like
06silly fast
06dunno what happened
04Lately I've been lagging alot.
04It's only on my browser and various online games though. mIRC has little lag.
06Heh
04Thus I cannot play TF2 online. Sadface
04Although I did find an item while playing with bots, which was amusing.
Which item?
04The Loch 'n Load Grenade Launcher
06I'm curious too :3. And items can be found even with cheats activated so xD
06Oh, that one is pretty fun but hard to use though
Lol cheata
04Yeah
04I noticed
06what I just like some slow-motion action with my bots ;-;
Gotta go, bbl
04When it said 'shattered on impact' I thought it meant 'explode'
04Obviously not
06.. not like that
04Cya Darky
06And yeah, many thought that at first xD
06and see ya ¨¨
06~~*
04Still, bots are fun.
04Too bad you can't get achievements, although engineer achievements would be ridiculously easy to get.
06Yes you can.
04THEY NEVER LEARN THAT THERE'S A LEVEL 3 SENTRY AROUND THE CORNER
06But it requires console swag
04You can?
04oh
06as in in-game console, not like an Xbox LOL
04I don't even know how to bring up the console lol
04obviously
06if your ~ key is over your tab key
06click that
06if not (like me) it takes a bit more
04That's what I do on Spore. 'moremoney' pz
04Nah, it's there
04plz*
06Then you just have to enable it in options (enable developer console) and click tilde
06I think
06I just enjoy doing it that way because I can add MOAR bots, mess up respawn timers and in general make things as super unserious as bot games should be
/me dies
06however, running tf2 on this computer would basically be assisted suicide
04XD
04I can run TF2 perfectly fine on moderate graphics (I think high graphics -the motion blur would be fine as well but I don't want to try), it's just I lag even when my internet is working 'properly'
04I average a ping around about 200
06motion blur chomps down resources and makes you motion sick, also makes scout and other aim-heavy classes harder to play :P
06And aww, you should try to go to the server list and sort by ping
06I've played on some australian servers
06(obviously lagging like a champ)
lmfao
06I run everything at low low low low even though I can run it on medium or high. But then again I am a member of FPSaholics anonymous soo
06And I know I seem MORE talkative while at school but it's lunch now anyway so nothing weird there :3
04XD
04That's fine
04So then I can talk (and waste classtime even more) with you guys at school :D
sup
06:3
:p
Drake, I'll bet you that they have it firewalled
aka portblocking
04Maybe
and you can use colloquy
06this nick can be considered "here but suddenly vanishing for 5min - many hours at a time"
or run mIRC via WINE
I'm not sure if xchat runs on macs but I assume so
04We all thought that my friend could get away with breaking through the filter, but not 2 hours afterward the IT guys called him up during class
haha
04I was thinking about colloquy
04Still, we've gotten into the Admin accounts on our laptops before - easier to do something when the IT guys aren't watching out every move.
04Seriously, if you're connected to the Clarence internet, they can see everything you're doing on your computer until you disconnect
06No matter what I'm sure your it guys are smarter than the ones here..
06I mean they do their job and "smart" is probably wrong to say
My guys are ;-;
06they just trust us too much
I /still/ haven't managed to get past the firewall/proxy
after 4 years
06I mean I can juggle irc and schoolstuff but at least they finally realized facebook should be blocked
06not everyone has dat willpower
/me shot
lmfao
04XD
/me goes back to editing Reminiscence
And Drake
the events in this chapter
are so predictable
06brb going home it seems
espeon is on the other side of the world?

Cool, thanks
Great song, this

Nope, how do I do that?

7this playlist takes 8hrs
7lol
7:D
Haha, ohshi-!
>doesn't mind 8 hours of ponies
7a little less since hasbro is taking down ponies on youtube :(
aren't they just taking down full pony eps? :O
7yea I believe so, but some vids are no long available..so i'm unsure..oh well we'll find out soon
Though as long as they don't go after PMVs and such, I'm good, pretty much.
ello
heya fry :p
7indeed
7maybe soon ponies on dvd!
7+ I have all eps on hd already ;)
Well, even so if they only release a DVD set, I'll buy it
There's bound to be some nice extras on there, too.
If they release a Blu-Ray set, my head will explode with joy
7me too!
/me is bored

Weeeee
04hi

"At least you'll get to see the Hensh again."
"I'm not entirely sure if that's a good thing."
04XD
I noticed they have all the fully molded ponies at the toy store that's closest to me...
I'm really tempted to go buy them all.
Hey Sathi, don't let that happen when more people are in
also ohai Rodman
7what happen?
Hai RobotPinkie
7RobotPinkie: you should totally get them!
Your messenger just popping into the stream
7there was no id :)
7and yes I moved it straight away
Just saying. email was there
Should I get them today, or tomorrow?
DO EET FILLY! But yes, if you can afford it, buy them
7and post a high res picture!
Yeah easily, I have plenty of money over
^^This. We want to see them!
but I do feel a bit silly when I have all the brushables, too :P
7your a collector
All the brushables, with no Colgate
/me 7nods
Naw I have a tube of Colgate in the bathroom. :P
well I have the Mane 6 brushables, anyway
7I wanna see!
KEKSI KEKSI KEKSIIIII
Come on, show us!
Hai Dari
7Don't think Dari is on yet

Oh, ok
That right there has to be one of my favorite Pinkie/Twilight scenes
I can upload a pic of the brushables, but not like... a really good one, right now

04And here I wasted my Sydney Sleeper on crafting the Bazaar Bargain
7sound quality okay?
Its a bit low, but overall good
7better?
Has anyone here ever tried the Blu e-cigarettes?
And I think that pic just gave me diabetes
Actually, thats better. Thanks
they hurt my throat :/
XD
And on my previous comment, saved
I'm thinking of buying the starter kit
well.. you can try it lol
but personally i thought it sucked
nothing quite beats a real cig :p
7I did the same :)
http://i.imgur.com/q77bD.jpg
02That gun is awesome
That's my bwushies, only Rarity is styled though.
Nice!
02and I still haven't gotten the Sydney Sleeper :<
02Bad luck ftw?
Even though only Fluttershy's and Rarity's hair looks accurate, thats still very nice
/me yawns
7so cute <3
WINTER WRAP UP YES!
I've only brushed Fluttershy's hair out, it was just... really bad to begin with
Hey Sathi, what program do you guys use to stream?
Only mods can stream though, right?
7yep
7not even all the mods
7you need to have a decent connection
Yeah, that I figure is a must
Aw man, I'm torn between wanting to just run out right now and buy them, and wanting to stay home and clean up a bit.
7my bf is cleaning the house :)
Do it in this order
>Clean shrine to ponies >Go buy ponies
Wish I had a bf to clean the house for me. :P
7your a woman too?
No, I'm a guy
7Ah
and well I do have a gf :P
7Yay CmC song
But she ain't cleaning your house ;P
but she's on the other side of the planet atm, so...
7ohh how come?
working in South Korea
Oh?
She is, not me, lol
Wait, you're from the US right?
No, though apparently you can't tell from my accent lololol
Haven't heard ya talk :V
Oh lol
7Yay love this one
Same issue here
but yeah, I'm from Sweden, I was just really obsessive about learning English as a kid.
Why wub Sweetie Belle in this song
On my end, always preferred speaking English instead of Spanish
Trivia: Apple Bloom's voice actress sings Sweetie Belle's song
Haha, really?
7this is awesome
Really

Looked like some sort of monkey
04Then I combined that with the Eyelander to get the Bazaar Bargain

7morning
04Are having an engineer vs Spy contest
Hai Pegacorn!
04Melee only
7pre-pre-pre show is up
'sup Pegacron
06possible facestab versus the weapon with the highest crit rate in the game
06... sounds oddly fair
04XD
04It's fun
I have mixed feelings towards it
On one side, I really liked the movie and the song was just lulztastic
On the other, I hate the US, so it was awkward at the time
I hate the US too,but the movie was a satire of the US's attempts to be the police of the world.
I know, thats why I really liked the movie
Cool.
I say AYE!
I would like that alot.
Though, whether it classifies as an A movie or B movie, I wouldn't know
7a moment pls
Totally an A-Movie.
06the new spy revolver sounds really fun if you play against oblivious engineers
7is it with puppets?
Yes it is
Yes.
04Which one?
7http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372588/
7looks A to me
It's... kinda really low budget...
inb4 Everyone has AIDS
04The Diamondback?
lol
Thats why it was funny RobotPinkie
Yeah I know
06yes
Best part is "so ronery," btw...
I for one though, would like to introduce my bronies to one of my favorite movies of all time
04XD
or that's my favorite part, anyway
06but then I read about the damage and they were clever enough to make the stored crits not strong enough to lolOneHit scouts

The "Lord of the Rings" of China, basically
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425637/
04awww
Red Cliff?
Ooooh, I want to watch that.
I've been one year in Taiwan, and I've got to say that is one of my all-time favorite movies ever now
My favorite movie of all time is Kick-Ass.My second favorite movie of all time is Scott Pilgrim vs The World.
04XD
I'm so not hip, my favorite movies are Fitzcarraldo and Dead Poets Society...
BTW,i request this:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EdAAZ2x5-E

Diablo III

I simply love games like it
Be it Diablo, Sacred or Fallout (I and II)
I think I'm a bit of an anomaly being an old-school Fallout fan whilst loving both 3 and New Vegas
Most will only side with one or the other
7I only played Wow ever since the closed beta

02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"
That's what I get for assuming they'd still have them. FFFFFUUUU
Oh well, got Pinkie Twi
ohai Dman, alsos
Sup robotpinkie
... pinkie twi? what? (just joined)
(so i have no idea what's been going on :D)
I'm good. Tax refund = Pinkie + Twi fully molded ponies
oh? link to this?
To what?
or what is this
No I mean I got money back on my taxes and decided to put it to good use. :P
my mind is full of sand (i'm still dazed / chillaxed from beach) i have no idea what that means. OH OK taht's what haha
fully molded thou? so like, off ebay?
Nah, the official ones
there are fully molded official ones?
Tiny ones, yeah
not as cool as the brushables, IMO, but on the other hand these I can keep in my pocket
oh the blindbag ones?
:S am confused, is there pictures of these?
blindbag? never understood what that was
the tiny ones
where RD and Fluttershy are recolours of each other's models
Yeah I guess those are the ones... though nothing blind about these, they're in transparent packaging
yea they are in blindbag sets AND a few other sets :D
and woohoooo!!!
you got TWIIIII
and Pinkie!
You KNOW what this calls for
Really love how both of them look
also, still g2 go back to Toys R Us to get me more ponies, but not yet
This calls for slow Twi zoom? :P
and yea the tiny ones are so :3
twi zoom been done, but yea
:D
/me sneaks off to stalk some more around Chernobyl
oh stream's offline?
yea
lol ohai Dermathil
I wonder if Dermathil was made a mod, if he could stream :D
Oh I'm pretty sure I could...
yay!
Would you stream a live playthrough of STALKER?
oh wait, u got synctube. we could go there. maybe.
that would be awesome :D
Synchtube only is for youtube videos
(>yfw you'd hear the 28 weeks later theme in STALKER
yay
also dermathil if u do playthru (plox do) i request you play legendary music at awesome points
It makes it SO MUCH BETTER
example: libera me from hell / nikopol when epic fight
something like that
Pinkie looks srsly nice
>mfw mane6 fighting is magic has 5 more gifs
:D
If I find a set, I'll give these two to my nephew, he loves pink and purple
i want a rd for my pocket at all times robotpinkie
also yah, if i need to buy new ones that come with repeats, it's brony sharing time : D
Dman, I wouldn't need to play awesome music.
It could only ruin it
: / okay
Well.... MEOWception, at least, at SOME point... right?
hahaha
you have the file, robotpinkie? the .mp3 i made?
Nope :(
(looped it so it can be used for lulz)
no?
u wantin'?
I made this like 5 mins after NewDCD darp'd and linked
Sure, you have it on mediafire or something?
already, yea
http://www.mediafire.com/?g87rbdmnm54j7go
meow meow meow
Yay! Thanks
lul
I might use that in a video one of these days....
Like normal PMV, and suddenly.....
hahaha
...i have a billion ideas for a trillion PMVs and can't decide on which one to sit down and do : /
i've done a few shenanigans, and - i can lip sync perfectly :3. i just don't know which song to actually use, i have so many I like
I only have one PMV I really desperately want to do, thankfully
I also have ONE song i'm making - a sort of compilation / medley :D
though I do have a pony related video I want to make....
RobotPinkie - unless it's something you really want to do on yer own, want help?
Maybe, though I'm too tired to work on it today
:(
it's only 5pm here
Kinda blown out from too much GIMP
HEY did you make any more vectors and stuff?
same here :P
Not yet, no
u have my timezone? <3
Couldn't find a good pic to do
ah well
anyone here play chess?
Thankfully I'll have all weekend off with nothing to do, yay
so ur too tired? : /
ah ok. I just need an idea to do...I might start one of my planned pmvs nao...
if i'm motivated to
maybe
Right now I'm kinda exhausted, it might get better after some more caffeine :P
ah ok then
...screw it, i'm starting one of my PMVS now then
It'd be fun to do another coop thing, though
coop? YES!
I'm pretty good at isolating animations and stuff like that
btw skills: pretty much anything with videos. i mean it. anything. any effect. but i fail at imagest thou
yay we should totally do something awesome then! <3
That'd be great
yay
but not today? you're tired?
Maybe a bit later, I'm not sure
Right now I just need to relax a while and look at ponies :P
okies
mfw fluttershy and daisy on my desk !!!! : D : D
still way too happy about getting those girly toys XD
Yay!
and u have like 6!
I've cleaned away everything but ponies and epic D&D game collection from my desk
has anyone seen them / asked you bout them?
lol several people have seen them, only one has asked
what happened?
It's the potential brony friend who asked a lot of questions about them :P
ah
/me sneaks off for reals
orly
Other people have at most just looked at me like I'm crazy
lul
Which I'm fine with, really
If I could, I'd get that giant Pinkie that was at comic con and have it in the middle of my living room. :P
eyup!
I mean I don't want people to yell at me and call me names, but as long as they keep it to themselves they can think what they like
Time for some Robot Chicken, I think...
i'm looking for clips of fluttershy that could be used for singing : D
robot chicken! love that!
I assume you already have looked at the clips of her actually singing, then?
yea just on it :D
NOPE
NOPE?
Nah.
Whuh?
lulwut
also ohai Ziltoid
Oh hey rb
:3
ohai also ziltoid
So yeah clips of who siging?
hi dman
Fluttershy
:3
ziltoid - just started on my first PMV. for the lols
i guess
Oh making one?
Well, your MW3 Inception trailer was awesome, so...
What are you trying to make?
ah thanks robotpinkie, but if you don't mind me saying first that was a request from a friend, and secondly, it's kinda pathetic. timing and fadeouts only thing used there.
but glad ya like it! just that i hope this PMV will be aLOT prettier
ziltoid - it might not be to the liking of some bronies, cuz of weird song genre, but 'Libera Me From hell' from gurren lagann, an anime. to ponies. =]
Cool
Hi
hi barry
Ohhh
ROW ROW FIGHT THA PONEHS
ohey barry!
also 'sup barry
also still haven't done much, busy with tidying up our lunch.
will actually begin in like 10 mins =]
(i wish i could like stream it or something, would be nice to have on the spot feedback :()
Not fast enough connection to stream anywhere?
i do, but dunno where i could
How are you guy?
Maybe ustream? I dunno
i'm good, barry : )
i guess i could try
i'd love to try, actually =]
I think you need to download some special program to reroute the desktop to the webcam stream somehow
i wouldn't mind :P
manycam
No idea how it works, really, but it doesn't seem all that hard
it's free and there's an option to remove watermarks
sudddenly rainbro
ohai rainbrodash
it's good for a starter anyway. you can't get the desktop sound out, but you can still use your mic while using manycam as a 'desktop webcam'
suddenly edward AND rainbro
also ohai guys
I'm lurking :P
Oooh, hot
ohai Pinkie
they see me lurking they hatin
internet derped
back
u jelly of my Pinkie and Twi toys?
Livestream allows you to stream for free doesnt it?
yeah, I use Justin.tv though
is Justin.tv better than ustream?
Justin is annoying because of their adds
i know all the starcraft streamers who -were- using ustream moved to justin.tv a while ago
but meh
Also, does anyone want to piss Dari off?
yes
always
What was wrong with ustream?
i jelly
idk
If you win the movie, pick the movie "Womb". Matt Smith is the main actor
^
lawl
no chess players? >.>
...Is it a good movie?
lol I kinda want to stream some lets plays in the future, that seems to be popular
No, it has Matt Smith
but pissing Dari off is enough for me
Oh, so in other words it's FANTASTIC
but yeah anyway I'm going back to lurking. kinda in limbo between watching K-On! and playing guitar
alright, rainbro, see you later
bai bai
Have fun lurking
cya rainbro
Yeah, tomorrow right before the lottery I'm going to try to convince people to pick it

Dr. Nyan, M.D.
And yes tonight is movie night
lawl metroid
Metroid Zero Mission.
What did you mean Rodman?
I need to play zero mission sometime
I played fusion
That game is pretty good
but not 0
I am still happy : 3
fusion was fun
nice video
Pegacorn, just saying. Dead Air hated you
I know
damnit...brb with metroid :D
Then again, the gauntlet part hated us all
Metroid 3 is best Metroid.
Fact.
Holy crap, that was hard, even in Normal
Super Metroid was a remake of 3 wasn't it?
or am I thinking something else...
Super is 3
um no
nice
Yeah, Super Metroid is Metroid 3
Super Metroid is best Metroid
show her your moves dude
Indeed it is!
I'll drink to that!
you guys remember the boss that you can electrocute to death? :D
Sexy sex talk
Second best Metroid is Shadow Complex.
FACT
shadow complex?
Ziltoid,wut chu talkin' bout?
Best metroid is Other M. :D
fuck you
lol what
Dashite be trolling
it's not a Metroid game, it's a Metroid clone for XBLA :P
I know
pokerface
but its still not funny
Dashite, obvious troll is obvious brony
DASHITE IS SPY!
BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY
test
I never played other M, never will, stuffed so full of weeaboo anti-feminist bullshit I don't want to see it
Really really good, I'd recommend it if you like Metroid 3.
The game itself actually isn't bad.
Anti-feminist?More like Pro-feminist!
uh-huh...and how are the controls working for you bro?
Controls are fine.
I don't mind the gameplay, I like it actually
Its what they did to Samus what I despise
@Pegacorn, so having Samus not turn on her fucking missles until her commander tells her to is empowering?
How's that game ending bug working for you?
"you may feel a small prick in your ass"
RS, he wasn't saying that.
oh
I hate feminism.They think they're all sooooooo great,while they aren't!
He was saying you used the wrong phrase.
Back
Rodman wanted something?
welcome back Dman.
Yes, Dman
Pegacorn: So do I.
thanks roxsnow25
inb4 breach
And ReticentSmolder,sorry,never played that goddamn game.
what Rodman?
hey dman
Did anyone ever send the RD vid to EqD?
it doesn't portray women in a positive light, much less a female role model in video games
Well, I didn't
sorry Pegacorn
Metroid 3
At least I hate Feminism that puts women above men.
Why are we watching house?
House still on1
THanks Sathi :3
Because House is cool.
its like Zelda...the second you give Link a voice people will hate it
7episode 3
Seriously only metroid game that's awesome
Imma go do it then, since Dari and RP didn't either
Of course, I'd recognise the quote anywhere ^_^
What?
lol
and besides, i left for 20 mins after ep1 so yea
RobotPinkie be trolling now.
@RobotPinkie behind 3 Prime was pretty fucking awesome
...Rodman u wat
Yeah I am trollan :P
I hate:feminism,eco-tards,Twitards,hippies and douches.
I wub Prime 1 and 2
So, has anypony been watching the new Thundercats?
Send it to EqD. Unless you don't want me to
*feminists
you can have feminism and radical feminism, there's a difference
Fusion wasn't bad either
I konw rodman, and i honestly don't mind, but 0___0
yeah, I liked fusion
Fusion had the SA-X
It IS 1/3 yours rodman my man
New Thundercats?DO NOT WANT.
HATE YOU SO MUCH~!
and the Fusion suit you could get into Prime :D
MLP is about feminism
Other M though? Uhm....
SA-X. the only thing I was scared of in GBA
*footsteps*
Other M had the best Ridley boss fight in the series.
And i meant feminists that put women over men.
Those parts where you had to escape the SA-X?
the only had metroid prime and all I remember I was being scared of the phazon mines.
SA-X is probably one of the best Metroid villains created, I think she was the inspiration for Dark Samus
MLP is about friendship
Was like "CRAPCRAPCRAPCRAPCRAP!"
and magic
Only saw the first one Prose
I actually have my suspicions that Lauren Faust is mildly feminist. Just mildly.
that too
BULLFREAKIN'HORSESHIT!
eyup
Yeah, running away from the SA-X was pretty nervewracking the first time.
SA-X and Ridley are among the top tier of badass villain figures in gaming
Not feminazi, but if you look, you'll notice it.
Nothing wrong with feminism. Might be a misnomer, at worst.
Epic Sax SA-X?
Running away on Hard mode was pretty bad too.
Offtopic,but does anypony else think that L4D Tanks are overpowered?
lol
lol
Nope
Lauren Faust? Feminist? You're shitting me Nittany_Tiger
yes
Pegacorn, u playing L4D2 much then?
L4D tanks are not overpowered.
Pegacorn, not that much
7he died :(
Auto-shotty > Tank
I was playing it this morning.
who died?
tank ai is overpowered in L4D2, player tanks can range from good to terribad
7Pega
ah
lol
well, at least he's playing the game :P
lol
I died about 5 times in the same goddamn level!
7we should play more Dman
Rodman: I didn't watch PPG because of it's negative portrayal of boys.
It was directed by Faust.
I watched PPG.I thought t was good.
Tanks depend more on where the spawn than anything else.
Though animated by Genndy Tartato..whoever.
But i hate most shows that portray boys as douchebag morons.
LAWL
hehe...just got zero mission
Sathi, i wouldn't mind, but cuz still saving for new pc, as current one plays at like 5 to 10 frames per second, so i'd like to but maybe some other day
I'm live now :3
still, thanks for hte maps ^_^
Genndy Tartakovsky, Nittany_Tiger
@Nittany PPG did make boys the villains more often than not, but you have to remember it through guys a bone with the single dad shtick
Personally, I really liked the show
Yeah PPG was good.
through guys a bone with the single dad shtick <- What?
the Professor was a good male role model in the show, balancing the incompetence of some of the other male characters (the mayor in particular)
I meant threw*
stoopid mom
Hallo
hello there Barry
I sense a fight.
http://radionintendo.com/listen.m3u this would be that link :p
Feminism is lessened in MLP, but you still have the fact that the first two male characters you see in MLP are Snips and Snails, and they're both morons.
wait, so zero mission is a remake of 3?
lol true
What about Big Mac?
and no reticentsmolder, it's a remake of 1
with extended ending
No, Zero Mission is a remake of 1
oh
lol
Ninjad xD
NINJA'D!

I was just about to post that...

Thats because 1 and 3 take place in the same planet
lol
all the metroids look the same
illegal downloads.
though, the soundtrack (even for GBA sounds) is quite good
exept not
1: Wreck Zebes. 3: Blow it up.
totally legal downloads...I own it
>mfw no one's played Shadow Complex
reticentsmolder, yea it does look similar. also, wait till u hear Fusion ... unless you have bfore
>don't have 360
I plyed shadow complex
Jerks.
I didn't mention downloading it
2. explore, rodman

03you know how you get 9 steps to find the island?
you guys never play metroid?
0___0
/me almost had a heart attack
03so at most you'd see 9 Pokémon per trip, right?
WALL.E
"i told them WAAALEEE"
03well in reality there's about 20, each visit to the island
Huh? Who never played Metroid?
suprise wall.E
03they're just in random places.
that's pretty much how you kill each boss, lots of missiles to the face
6Yep.
whutwasdat wall.e
03This script finds and gets all 20. :)
6o.o

03I got leveled up by my friend using his hack-script on my account
03he used to have to use some tools and do it by hand
03until like 3 days agto :)
03*ago

lol
wikipedia: "EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator)"

DinkyPage died
03since I don't want to actually give it away
7no..dinkypage got cut off
6:D
6Thanks. :>
03I always find it weird how the Entralink calls it the Entree Forest
i heard it was attacked by cyberterrorists : <
03are they serving my Pokémon for dinner now?
Entra>Entry>Entree
Dman, its heaven.
7 Our old site is still down thanks to Hacktivist group "Anonymous Columbia"
Sounds disgusting :P
mfw I watched the inhaler vid
it was used to attack other sites by cyber terrorists
...Wrek, i like the dance at the end hahaha
Naw the cyberterrorists used Dinkypage to attack
6Entry + Tree = Entree. :P
6</obvious>?
its a darn shame really.
then the cyberpolice were called
compared to Hairi(nk)>Hairi>Hairu(tree)
cyperpolice are pretty active man.
03oh
03Tree as in tree
i justed wanted to say
muh
yes, tree as in tree
03I was thinking Entree as in, the French word for meal o.o
:>
hello there :)
more like Dinkypage's provider was called, er called them and told them they were suspended
Body piercings on bacteria.
ok
/me sets his C-gear back to the basic skin
;p
I like the cyberpolice idea better
06or entree as in dutch for entrance
aw, skating Pikachu is bad?
03it's really distracting LOL
how bout them cyber detectives!
Samus, y u no space jump boots?
so much pony on my table right now... SO MUCH OMFG
no pony on mah table
03I'm gonna need to reboot to get my NDS Adaptor Plus or w/e it is to work
ROBOTPINKIE I WANT UR DESK....soon....
TEH WINNING
/me 's head explodes
epic pic dashite
saved
6Hmm, DRF:
nice custom.
Wow
03?
wouldn't it be hard to walk on 3 legs and fire with the fourth?
6Would it be possible to 'hack' to send multiple pokemon from the Dream World to your game?
that's awesome Dashite
03nope
/me lays low
bluesun says no :<
03I don't think the script can do any hacks server-side
um reticentsmolder i guess to move, but could walk on all 4 leaning on canon.
6Okay.
03if it could I'd want 999 Oran berries :|
Well, it's an appropriate name for it.
once you choose a Pokemon, the server deletes every other Pokemon you've befriended :/
After seeing the cut scenes from Other M, I'm pretty sure Samus is Derpy
Hn
:(
so even if you make your way back to the tree the list is empty
Derpy became a bounty hunter
03LOL, imagine actually getting 9 pages of Pokémon a day
wouldn't the 4th be longer to leave room for the leg and the cannon?
03you'd fill your boxes up in like a week
03XD
Guys, hey guys
http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=655
13DW always implies you can send more than one Pokemon at a time :<
Dunno if old news, but DAMN!
nice shirt
06BBL, Shower
yeah, it would have to be walking on 3 legs while keeping the 4th up and shooting
well, you can in certain situations
03yeah, like events, right?
you can stock up Pokemon in the demo ver and then when you register a GSID you can transfer them over 10 at a time
iirc
and events, yeah
03LOL what
03inb4 using the hacking script on a demo account
6I sent my normal pokemon and event Espeon at once.
lol...I don't even want to imagine pony screw attack, but the sprint booster would look nice
I dunno, I mean she wouldn't be able to run as fast, for sure
13I mean other than events .w.
... pony screw attack. probably just like normal, a load of forward rolls ^_^
sure a power suit could comensate for that
robotpinkie - she could run fine, just not shoot and run
12Has that dodgy idea gone where if you send a shiny pokemon to the dream world it comes back original colours?
yeah, it comes back shiny
Pony Samus would use something like the shoulder mounted weapon Predator used.
echo II
I mean she could probably run and shoot, just not nearly as fast....
yea
maybe...maybe the suit would have a built in sling for when she needed to run and shoot? or it would drop a stand?
....why am I discussing the physics of a pony samus.
/me is back from college
Back-mounted gun
12I'm not going to risk that anyway xD
7wb Dermathil
@Sumica, because someone posted pony samus
sumica, it's what we do
hey dermathil
ohai dermathil. what u get up to in college?
or maybe she runs on her hind legs while shooting, did you think of that? :P
I gots my schedule and list of books to buy and stuff
i thought of that ,but then went 'hmm...nah. it's ponies, they're not bipeds'
back mounted gun...she would have to duck her legs, and then it couldn't be an arm...erm LEG cannon anymore
That would, of course, look absolutely ridiculous...
how does it look for next year for you dermathil?
yes but i just caught my self joining in sort of a wait wut moment in my head.
Dman, well, the next 15 weeks looks like they will be crammed full with studying.
good lukc then man
Also, I moved one of my classes from Wednesday (I DON'T want 7 hours of class in a row that jumps my dinner) over to my previously empty friday.
It always looks like that at the start and then I end up slacking off. :/
lol
No 7 straight hours? :p
I feel like Zero mission is babying me...actually telling me where I'm supposed to go? ppffft
RS, can't you turn that off?
maybe?
every time I get an upgrade the fucking statue says: GO THIS WAY
lol Smolder, if you ever play Shadow Complex, turn off the guide lines
sathi, do you know Professor layton?
THis lady is crazy
Makes it just ridiculously easy to find your way... not fun.
7yes I do
okay
oki off to go get payed for doing nothing again. Be back later.
yay~ my request may or may not be 2 minutes of it =]
7see you in a bit Sumica
later, sumica
later sumica
03why would you send a shiny to DW in the first place?
later sumica
so wait...in Super Metroid you're actually /returning/ to Zebes?
lolol trollan
their faces when
stream... behaving a bit weird for anyone else?
yea reticentsmolder, i think so
nope
nope
to show it off?
Nope, all fine here.
Robotpinkie - it disconnects me every 5 or som inutes for some reason
but both Zero Mission and Super Metroid take place on Zebes with different maps
how is it weird for you?
03it'll look shiny on the island?
nah
03so then what's the point?> LOL
Hi AE and DRF
It sometimes freezes the video, and disconnects me sometimes
reticentsmolder, super metroid you go back to zebes. wiki: " She then follows Ridley to the rebuilt base on Zebes to stop the Space Pirates in their new plan to clone the Metroids and use them as a weapon. "
RS, they had the technology. They rebuilt, bigger, faster, tougher.
Yea robotpinkie, same
Most of the time it looks fine, though
7it's fine here i'm tuned in myself
/me is Espypet :3
d/c and occational 1 second freeze before continue
13:3
it's just veemi
well, there are shiny events, like crown raikou which would be recognisably shiny via their OT
03you mean cannon fodder?
^^
No
:|
Might just be my connection that's fucking up, too.
03oh god
03running two VMs at once is really slow
:/
: / *. stupid wink face D:
;)
hah, I knew it, who was saying that it didn't? :P
lolol
because the regions are all named the same, just different maps
7mibbit needs new smileys
@Sathi...yes, yes it does
DAMMIT I KNEW IT WAS THE CLEANING LADY
DAMN OLD PEOPLE!

House is such a boss
I hope MLP:Fighting is Magic comes out soon.
House doesn't make mistakes even when he's hallucinating.
House is BAWS indeed.

some of the bats and shit don't actually pursue you, I'm talking in terms of aggression
i like how that's random colours on my xchat
That's only because Samus is such a baws.
indeed
Rofl
hmmm?
Samus:BAWS bounty hunter.
6Are you using the percentage signs as a means of gradiation?
yep
there's nothing like the feeling of going back to a place you recently visited with the proper upgrade and finding a shit ton of expansions
6There are actual symbols for that purpose.
lol
6And in multiple shades.
BAWS stands for Bad At Wearing Suits
nope
relay?
really*
because she fucking loses her suits at the start of every game.
6Yes.
have you SEEN the metroid prime suits?
It's boss but in 1337 speak.
theres not a single suit Samus can look bad in
Loving that PED suit.
hell, she could rock the zootsuit, and OWN it
Not that she looks bad IN them
can you show me?
she's just bad at keeping her suits
6Sure.
true
she loses one every fucking intro XD

@Dermathil, is it another RTS?
I get redirected to a suspended page.
Episode 6? Maybe 7
http://bronystate.co.cc/theatre/

mfw Pink Floyd
Ohhhh, different page. No more dinkypage.
espylacopa, dinkypage was raided, and is down, so use Sumica's link
lol, I'm still using the dinkypage, but using a google cache :D
this is ep 6, i think ,dashite
who said pink floyd?
House
M.D.
is this the ep: "A mother, Lucille Palmeiro, collapses after a blood clot travels from her leg to her heart. After arriving in the hospital, she begins to vomit blood, causing House to expect a Vitamin K deficiency. " ?
a /brohoof you him then
Yeah!And i was once sitting at a table and then,outta nowhere,Nick comes out and shoots me!And worst of all,he stole my burger!
yes baseball is verry sad.
OH THIS IS SAD DAY!
He stole your burger? What a jerk! I hate him!
I hate him too!
robotpinkie, dermathil can't let you do that :P
oh pegacorn, u so entertainin' =]

7indeed it is
ah
Always calling me a sweater wearin' wuss.
What an asshole!
so we're going to episode 8 today?
or was it 9?
I don't know why the rest of them always save him. He seems to hate everything.
(BTW Dman,i have 2 tabs open.I'm both Pegacorn AND L4DSmoker)
Yeah.Even Francis didn't hate that much stuff!
=D nice one pegacorn
@POMFmeter House (yeah I know it's not working
NO BLOOD
don't like that automated shit
/me 4has a confession to make
No, no blood. no, no blood
/me 7is all ears
ORLY Ghosties?
We're listening Ghosties
/me 4much prefers House to Gokaiger and Japanese men in tights
"NotScripts encountered invalid encryption for this site's settings / Exceeded storage quota on http://wbe003.mibbit.com/?settings=6339e493f99fcc0d705aeadfabb4751f&server=irc.epic-chat.net&channel=%2523BronyState"

....Ok Ghosties.
It's fine to not like things.
4I know, I'm sure I've rattled all your world
4But it's the terrible, terrible truth
Chrome + NotScripts seems to dislike embedding now. . .
*shock*
but it's GOKAIGER
*cough*
GOKAI CHANGE
Not really, House is better than most of the things you mentioned
GOKAI CHANGE!
It's finally done. Chapter one of my LoZ: MLP story
...just not better than Japanese men in tights :3
http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7303278/1/My_Little_Pony_An_Oceanic_Adventure
Gokai *cough* Change *cough*!
Is the stream lagging to everyone else?
yes
4And I just don't care about Gokaiger
BARRY WOOHOOOOO!!!
Nope, no lag here.
theres a slight lag but nothing major
Yeah freezes up from time to time here
Ok, so nothing unusual then
same robotpinkie
Maybe once an episodethe video will freeze for about a second or so.
wow
Just let me know what you think
but yea not unusual
we need a priest!
4...that's that one woman
THAT WOMAN IS A SPITTER!
4I can tell now
hate those rogues sleathing arround hemorraging
get a bucket in here plenty of blood now.
7if it lags a bit just refresh
4Oh, what the fuck was her name
I wonder what the other survivors think of Nick.
*cough*
Ghosties, I don't think wtf was her name
I think it's probably related to veemi, because I've checked, I'm not having connection problems.
Nick is tasty.
yea robotpinkie
happens to me too D:
He sure is.
I wonder if the survivors know that.
*cough*
Dunno.
mfw there's a vitamin K?
eyup
BTW Dman
Sent
Maybe if we offered to share?
yes, there is vitamin K
Yep, it's what helps blood to clot
rodman ... D:
it's in yogurt
4The woman played Angela Orosco and Claudia Wolf
Hemophilia is a lack of vitamin k
:D
4I'm sure of it, I'd recognize that retching sound anywhere
and EdwardNewgate vitamins: A B1 C D B2 E B12 K1 B5 B7 B6 B3 B9
Gah, so many
I wonder how the survivors would react seeing us comming.
Usually with bullets. :/
With bullets, like always
b-but wheres my vitamin F or G?
NINJA'D!
Yeah,they're so mean!
Not discovered, yet?
*cough*
Not on my screen Rodman. :p
/me pounces on Rodman and starts to rip him to shreds
GAH, STOP DMAN MY HEAD HURTS
vitaminF, wrek, is just fatty acids, and there's more than one vitamin F
and vitamin G is riboflavin, too common to relaly be a 'vitamin'
WOAH WOAH HUNTER!CALM DOWN!
/me puts rodman together again and revives him
/me performs the EPIC PELVIC THRUST OF MANLINESS, banishing the Hunter to the Moon.
*cough*
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
also, wrek, vitamin G is now called B2, aka riboflavin
Dman, thanks but i was jsut mkaign a joke, a bad one at that but still. adn now the news.
/me jumps around on the moon
Whoa!
Aaaand Rodman...you sent it? D: D: D:
Look how high I can jump!
that's alot of hamburgers
Yup
I CAN SEE THAT HUNTER!
Wrek Chimpanzee, Monkey news
/me soars through the air
Dunno if Seth will even see the email
/me tries to look at the moon.
But its in his database now
/me gets a running start
:(
However, if he sees it, I don't doubt he'll post it
/me leaps back down to earth
Hum....Infected....on the moon?
Do not want.
Seeing as Sethisto favorited the original Twilight one
Rodman uhmm....
Yay!Hunter is back!
*cough*
uhmm....?
uhmm Rodman- why did yo-... O_____O
/me lands on Rodman for 25k point pounce
Lolwut
WOW!
*cough*
BECAUSE I'M LAWFUL EVIL DAMMIT!
haha
Hm
How do I set FireFox to save my tabs when I close it?
06lots of silly events in tf2 to render for no reason besides fun it seems.
/me receives the Hunter with a second EPIC PELVIC THRUST OF MANLINESS, this time banishing to the Sun.
06And I can't remember, I've just gotten used to task-killing Firefox to close it
06|D
Herp
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Hm?
7Abort firefox.exe. :P
06Opens in "Restore Fans" stuff
7Or...
Ah
/me drags Rodman with him
/me saves Hunter
7History, Restore Previous Session.
I GOTCHA!
wtf is going on in this chat
*cough*
I have no idea
13My firefox gives me the option to restore previous session every time I open it o-o
Whee! Smoker saves!
These two
K
skitsofrenia
It doesn't for me
XD
I'll task kill it
06Mine did too but I accidentally clicked "don't show again"
06and it never really had an impact anyway
^
re-learning new timing on the wall jump fucking sucks
/me nukes chat
Skitsofwutnao?
13Mine doesn't do that o-o
Erm
@ Espy
Wut :p
AjNwodjwpd
Schizophrenia
I probably butched the spelling
7You can find it again under settings or whatnot.
I always found Zero Missing timing to be much easier.
@ Don't Show Again specifically
There it's OVER
13It takes me to the firefox google homepage and underneath it says "restore previous session"
I'm too used to Super Metroid's
Oh man if that video gets featured on EQD, my head will explode
What does Schizophrenia mean?
06also my pc does not like rendering
06xD
You mean Zero Mission, right Dashite?

Pegacon, ninjad

Espy mine does ;3

High-def effects? :P

Did an Espeon fall on you when you shot it while it was hanging in the sky?
ORBIT.SPACE ORBIT,IN MY SPACESUIT SPACE.
DAMNIT, I can't wall jump for my life anymore :(
SPAAAAVE :P spave
Woah
Freezing hard now
its upsetting...
Reticentsmolder, still rockin' the M:ZM? nice one mate!
nice one!
*cough*I don't know why the survivors hate us so much.
RS, it's really not that hard.
The stream is freezing quite a bit for me
l4dsmoker, don't attack the survivors then :3
yea i got that too rodman : /
Me too
just refresh occasionally
They shot at us first!
Sathi, could it be to do with quality you're uploading?
*cough*Yeah,they did.
@Dman, well, in my defense I'm trying to wall jump to bypass the space jump boots in an area :P
perhaps it's too high for some? I mean it looks fine to me, and runs fine, but maybe for others?
Ah reticentsmolder, u ninja
:P
But really,i shouldn't attack too much.It's a bad habit i have.*cough*
I love the wall jump exploits, but I think they tweaked zero mission so you can't use them in certain places, ie places before space boots
one more time
dat slap
7harder!
dat House
"thank you sir may I have another"
lol
You got to hand it to them
/me grumbled softly...
probably ReticentSmolder
They don't like Sequence Breaking
Why does my nose hate me...
So they fix it
OMG I GOT IT
*cough*
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD IT FEELS GOOD
ummm...expansion...feels good man

06and someone who doesn't understand how FRAPS noms so much hdd space so easily
Damn Jockeys,always stealing my survivors away!

I see i see of course
well, I got the basic concept, I still have to traverse the wall, I'm bypassing a part using wall jump instead of space jump to get into a hallway leading to a chozo statue
4I'd like a fim pony
13Oh shit, Is it lupus?
A Hugh Laurie pony
06space isn't really an issue for me atm but

holy crap RobotPinkie your twi and rarity are INSANE

RobotPinkie - Excellent :3
ahhhhhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhHhHhHhHHHHHhHh
but then they would have to retool the whole asiambly line instead of just using the crap they have already.
youritebrah
@Dman, I always think that game is Double Dragon for some reason...probably because that's the only fighting game from that era I played
(RobotPinkie can u post pics of ur mane6? i made a folder for you and would like to have them :3)
I'm not gonna get it :(
ReticentSmolder, It's Ninja Gaiden. One of my all time favourite games.

Heya again Razyn!
Dman, what are the other 3?
Dman no i have the tf2 one on the main, and then matching on the ones with same resolution
02Why do people don't rocket jump? ;-;
4It better damn well be. Silent Hill 3 is the epitome of terror
Dementium: the ward, LSD Dream Emulator, and silent hill 1.
no other game has scared me
Ohai Razyn.Did you meet my pal L4DSmoker?He's a Smoker from L4D.
12WHY is my confirmation letter slow and all my other friends get theirs on the day/day after

SATHI WOOHOO
Dman, Thief?

Pegacron, we've... met.
Dashite - played that. and instead of 'this is meh cuz it's only scary and i'm not scared' i was actually all'YEA LIKE A BAWS HIDDEN FROM U LIKE A BAWS' lvoed dat game
4It didn't do anything for me. Perhaps it's not fair that I played the three other main games before getting to number 1 : /
hmm
1 was my first
hello
Dman, damn straight.
Hammer Haunts still creeped me the hell out.
then 2 then 3. but i haven't played any others other than shattered memories. Ghosties: Shattered memories is AWESOME, so well done. not scary thou.

Even though the chicken+veggie mish-mash isn't in the pie, it still looks delicious.
07o.o

Silvermane is back!
also dat 4th wall in final scene, ghosties, made me shiver so damn much. ' you gotta stop hating your mother,' cuz demographic was teenagers, and most teens hate mothers. I don't hate mine :3, but friends said they shat themselves during that scene.
4Kaufmann was definitely my favorite character though, at least in Shattered Memories. I loved Cheryl too
hey Razyn, Dashite
how Dman, since youve been so nice, decide what i should draw, i have a hard time deciding
now*
Kaufmann awesome
So, L4DSmoker, that girl with the weird mouth... How'd that work out?

A House is fine too
"endure"?
12..my mum is officially mean.

House is awesome.
12She put a criminal programme on that I want to watch now
11House is an asshole.
House is an awesome asshole
An awesome asshole
Eeeeeyup
RobotPinkie, Silverscreen, ain't that the truth
awesome asshole mind
11He's cool to watch, but I would end up decking the fucker if I ever met him.
also ohai Silverscreen, didn't see you there
4Who here is aware that the guy the patient is married too was a co-protagonist in the other FOX series "Prison Break?"
13Watch the program and do your student finance at the same time

interesting fact
4And on the topic of Dr. House, I think the guy's awesome
Minecraft, y u so addictive
I dunno, House does some.... really major league asshole things
I'd give him a gravity gun and a crowbar
BUGGER chrome derp

4Dear god, she's House's Garrus
Turian finger quotes
Character development

Garrus?
4There's ALWAYS character development when calibrations are involved
Silverscreen, sorry what was that a reply to? chrome derped
House IS indeed an awesome asshole.
oh the hug?
*cough*House is cool.
4Garrus is a character in Mass Effect and in Mass Effect 2. Whenever you talk to Garrus, he always has to do calibrations
also, can you kick Dman? or does that not speed up his removal, so I can be Dman again?

PeanutButterWolf, next week it's LOTR marathon, yes. that's fri sat sun.

I was so confused
however, PeanutButterWolf, two lottery draws still to be done for the 2 eps per day for LOTR
11House just pulled a Sherlock Holmes
(is this correct sathi?)
omg that blinging was the stream?
7I prefer Nyanspeon. :P
holy fuck
yeah ValtheJean
(will all 6 FIM eps be chosen today? or 2 today, and 2 fri 2 sat?)
I got a Gmail chat from my sister..like..EXACTLY at the same time
asdfeon>all
4House and Wilson pretty much are modern day Holmes and Watson. Even the creators have said so
eyup
oh fff- that's right, no movie lottery this week, I guess
ghosties, you're a mod. can u answer it pleeease? I'd like to know what's going on
hes Deeeenar
but but RobotPinkie 2 fim eps per day for LOTR!
That explains why I like both
FUCK YO DNR

4Wait, what?
7On August 26-28 we will be streaming an End of Summer Lord of the Rings Special. Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King each night at 7 PM followed by two pony episodes each.
Yeah I know!
4Dman, PM me

He's House
DNR: Do not revive
got that, sathi, but when / how FIM eps picked? is it saturday lotto?
7yes
07Lucario > asdfeon
/me runs
11House would not last a day in an actual hospital. XD
She will sue him so hard. Right in the face.
/me actually agrees
House would get fired for sure
ah okies. so 6 lotto draws this saturday then?
if so
/me finally gets it
House could just say he did not see the paper
7We will discuss it and get back on it tomorrow
07:P
oh? still not actually decided? : /
ValtheJean ^
He would actualy need to see the pice of paper for it to take effect
11That move alone would have gotten his medical license removed.

yea MrPoniator
I'm so glad Hugh Laurie seems like a nice guy in real life...
sure is
give or take
Um, MrPoniator, just incase you don't yet know, From FB: "The line up for tonight is: Goonies, Cutie Mark Chronicles, Buckaroo Banzai, Boast Busters."
07Why you sitting on me?
RobotPinkie, he bloody is an nice guy, a very nice guy.
Yeah, I knew the lineup
he is awsum
Just had to check the time
okie dokie loki
that face
installan / uninstallan?
mfw i've yelled SCALPEL twice during kinky doctor and nurse play
I love Hugh Laurie's songs
Dat install screen
RobotPinkie, did you know Laurie made about 1/5 of the music in House MD?
:D
well, helped make
07Hi Aero =D
he ACTUALLY fully made about 10 or 15 songs for the show just on his own
hi pat!
Did not know that, though I'm not surprised he did some of the music
That's quite cool
7Ah, Nick, I feel like I should be RPing with you. :P
Hugh Laurie is one of those humans you just can't help but look up to, because of how much stuff he's done in one lifetime.
I kinda find it funny how you can get court martialized for actually saving someone's life
He wrote a lot of funny songs for A Bit of Fry & Laurie, of course
11House meets Law & Order
Oh hai, random window
That statement sums House up perfectly.
My favorite comedy show growing up :D
he's written a book, plays 6 instruments perfectly, acts brilliantly in many different (completely different) roles, perfectly, has a family, knows more than one language, has seen the world.
Hugh Laurie is BAWS
I think I might love Stephen Fry even more, though
he is outside of 'baws' tier, imo, pegacorn. that good

11Hello, Batman's Gambit
Gambit?WHERE?
Stephen Fry is the final BAWS of the entire world, I think. :P
ohey der, inb4 pegacorn owns him :D
Wish I could win a court by talking to a judge like that
7Dman to get back to your question tomorrow we do the lottery for only the pony episodes
/me 11tosses a card at Pegacorn's head
02*sunglasses*
I pwned Gambit with a single slap.
Eeyup
Ah thanks sathi! just one more question, if that's alright. will there be a lotto on saturday for next friday's 2 eps, and one then for sat's 2 eps, and one then for sun's 2 eps HHHHHNNNNNNGGGGGGg or 6 draws this saturday for all 6 FIM eps next week?
may I ask but how does this lottery during the MLP episodes work?
i'm kinda confused
03<Pattyrick> Yay, my PC works =D <- using that Wi-Fi adapter I sent you?
QI might be my second favorite show on TV right now...
MrPoniator Been in courts that often?
11Pegacorn: If you're talking about the Gambit in the Wolverine movie, I would totally believe that.
still, thanks for taking time to tell me sathi ; )
07not at the moment
07my old PC needs it, though
07xD
/me is falling asleep
03oh

07Yup
07actually
Silverscreen, gambit was a pretty cool guy
/me is totally unaffected by the card.

RobotPinkie, you took caffeine in the end?
WhatPayne, nah

nah, i'm not gonna force you to something, pegacorn
03*like
I know.
My neighbor unfortunately took PCP and is banging his walls again. Not because of me, mind you.
10Bjornfot, how's it going buddy? Nice to see you
...whew
but you know you want me~
07No, he didn't crash it from viruses
7Bad news everyone I don't have the time to take requests after this episode
I meant that the shipping begins.
07IDK how he crashed it, tbh
awwwwww
07he just said that he used it hard and, within a few minutes, crash
: / robotpinkie does caffeine wake u up? it don't do anything to me :( i can't stay up
03prolly Error_Dumb_User_Alert
/me hides
07but he said that, for a PC, it's very good
oh look he's not dead
home-made pot pie is delicious
You're going to bed, Dman?
sathi - that's fine. you said you might not aniway so it's ok
Goin' good, RainBroDash! We're even making some progress in the game, and I won an argument, so we'll have romanceable Spike!
7DRF, I'm going on wi-fi.
It's Lupus!
RobotPinkie, aww heel naw! but when I DO get tired, i literally can't the brain.

He's too stubborn to die? I would like to have that condition too
7In the wi-fi room.
I've got a parking sandwich and a chicken ticket because i can.
i aint' sleepin, if u ain't sleepin, RobotPinkie, my same-timezone brony
03I was just about to go "Crap, I forgot to put the Pokémon in my partyh"
10Hahaha Bjornfot, you're a crazy viking, but I'm glad you got your way
03-h

So sad :(
07Nintendo needs to up the ante on their tech
Which is why I use old school windows start menu
Nintendo does fail in their approach to wifi :\
03they have, but the DS is old now.
Pegacorn i don't get you. do you like love or hate Bjornfot?
or online gaming
WE MUST SAVE THE OSIRIS!
It's complicated, I'm betting
Nopony gets me,i'm the wind!
(lol Tom Servo)
Dman: in RL i think he likes me like a bro, and in RP he alternates between love and hate
7Reconnected; still don't see you.
7You sure you're in the wi-fi room?
03maybe I have the wrong friend code?
03yes
03let me check something
7We've traded before, so..

(Brb,gotta eat.)
RainBroDash, Nurse MirthTinker and Doctor Silvermare would like to see you...

7Can you try disconnecting and reconnecting?
That's just how House rolls.
Though I'm sure Dari will read me some one of these days. :P
13Never been able to connect successfully on the first go with anyone in that game >>;
I understand everything by just reading about it once, or hearing it during class. I don't need to "study".
oh Dman, don't be silly; mai waifu can't walk in on another reality; just watch it on tv

HIPSTERS GONNA HIPSTER
03Um, TMI?
/me hides
I thought the dial only went up to Pony Pony Swag.

EspyLacopa, I went ponyer (DUUUUUUUUUUUUN)
03nope
03This is White version
03it still says that

11"It'll either cure me or kill me.....I'm okay with this."
"youll get your arm back, or you'll die. win/win" made me lol
07tbh, I'm not a big fan of football either, drf :P

Hi tech colour xrays here

RobotPinkie, ya got mane6. any other ponies?

07a few people recommended I try out for lineman because they thought I had a good build for it
03LOL
07and I figured I should challenge myself
Like the brushables are available, obviously
03people have said the same to me
Even though that wasnt an xray but meh
07hi bluesun
like, RobotPinkie, for example, do you have rainbow cloud or daisy dreams?
and the tiny tiny ponies
I'm always rather disgusted by those shots from inside the veins etc
03since I could easily tackle people
03but I was like no
13hi
yeah, we only have the brushables
03LOL "Would you like to play with Quany again?"
I don't know, Dman

Thanks
lulokie
Hai. When's the LotR marathon weekend again? Is that next week?
7next week
Dman, with Rarity you basically just soak her hair in hot water and wrap it like this http://www.ponychan.net/chan/merch/src/130726040057.png

I'm looking forward to Skyward Sword. Might actually give me a reason to use my Wii.
And don't cut Rarity's hair, srsly.
Some people say you need to, but it's perfect the way it is
Cut rarity's hair
FOR HEAVY MODDING
what in the derp. I save an image, and this happens
Oh god, please don't say I mised important hair styling comments
Yay, more surgery.
FOR GREAT JUSTICE
Still, Assassin's Creed, Skyrim and Skyward Sword are coming out within like a week of each other. Not enough money, not enough time.
7Espys?
herp. what the derp?
Pirate it? lol
CrimsonStorm, seen latest AC trailer? (2 days old?)
Just told you not to cut Rarity's hair, Dman :P
Im waiting for Payday: the Heist and journey
At least with Skyward Sword, you know it'll be about as good as all the previous Zelda games.
By AC, you meaning Armored Core?

Has anyone here made baked bads?
EVEN IF Applejack killed most of PonyVille!
hmm. well RobotPinkie ive read about 1/3 of brushables thread, and saw a few for her. i just want her to be like show, with long hair flowing on flooor for mane, and hair on head coming off left with curls, and right over one eye slightly with a small curve at the bottom :3
I wonder how the earthworms are still alive despite those muffins having been in the oven or so
Dmann: Let's just say that if Hasbro ever release a life size Fluttershy plushie, I'd literally be all over her. Or at least, my bodily fluids would be.
Well, at least Spike likes them.

Ah grats Cross, good to see you with us even if they did't give you color yet
Also, no. I would not watch MLP if the ponies weren't ponies
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The original poster art (not used on the video tape box) featured the cast dangling from the feet of another with the top one hanging on a rock. Some of the newspaper ads featured slightly different artwork with the characters drawn in a different order from top to bottom.
*ponyshrug* at least I didn't get kicked
brb
yay the goonies :D
13First thing I saw when I glanced at this chat was "then I start sucking again", and I started wondering what you were talking about o-o
