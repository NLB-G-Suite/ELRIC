02Good luck(?)
04back
06Drakes
04heya Xeli
06besides the ping... my connection at home is faster o.o
Its a schoo
06Well it used to be like
06silly fast
04Lately I've been lagging alot.
06Heh
04Thus I cannot play TF2 online. Sadface
04Although I did find an item while playing with bots, which was amusing.
Which item?
04The Loch 'n Load Grenade Launcher
06Oh, that one is pretty fun but hard to use though
Lol cheata
04Yeah
04I noticed
06what I just like some slow-motion action with my bots ;-;
Gotta go, bbl
04When it said 'shattered on impact' I thought it meant 'explode'
04Obviously not
06.. not like that
04Cya Darky
06And yeah, many thought that at first xD
06and see ya ¨¨
06~~*
04Still, bots are fun.
06Yes you can.
04You can?
04oh
06as in in-game console, not like an Xbox LOL
04I don't even know how to bring up the console lol
04obviously
06click that
06if not (like me) it takes a bit more
04Nah, it's there
04plz*
06Then you just have to enable it in options (enable developer console) and click tilde
06I think
/me dies
06however, running tf2 on this computer would basically be assisted suicide
04XD
04I average a ping around about 200
06And aww, you should try to go to the server list and sort by ping
06(obviously lagging like a champ)
lmfao
04XD
04That's fine
04I'm currently trying to find an IRC client for my Mac (LLOTS found one and I'm going to try it out tomorrow)
04So then I can talk (and waste classtime even more) with you guys at school :D
06:3
:p
aka portblocking
04Maybe
and you can use colloquy
06this nick can be considered "here but suddenly vanishing for 5min - many hours at a time"
or run mIRC via WINE
haha
04I was thinking about colloquy
06I mean they do their job and "smart" is probably wrong to say
My guys are ;-;
06they just trust us too much

I'm really tempted to go buy them all.
Hey Sathi, don't let that happen when more people are in
7what happen?
7RobotPinkie: you should totally get them!
7there was no id :)
7and yes I moved it straight away
Just saying. email was there
Should I get them today, or tomorrow?
7and post a high res picture!
Yeah easily, I have plenty of money over
^^This. We want to see them!
but I do feel a bit silly when I have all the brushables, too :P

7I wanna see!
KEKSI KEKSI KEKSIIIII

04And here I wasted my Sydney Sleeper on crafting the Bazaar Bargain
7sound quality okay?
Its a bit low, but overall good
7better?
Has anyone here ever tried the Blu e-cigarettes?
And I think that pic just gave me diabetes
Mightyena, i have
they hurt my throat :/

nothing quite beats a real cig :p
7I did the same :)
http://i.imgur.com/q77bD.jpg
02That gun is awesome
That's my bwushies, only Rarity is styled though.
Nice!
02and I still haven't gotten the Sydney Sleeper :<
02Bad luck ftw?
Even though only Fluttershy's and Rarity's hair looks accurate, thats still very nice
/me yawns
7so cute <3
WINTER WRAP UP YES!
I've only brushed Fluttershy's hair out, it was just... really bad to begin with
7flash media encoder
Only mods can stream though, right?
7yep
7not even all the mods
7you need to have a decent connection
Yeah, that I figure is a must
Aw man, I'm torn between wanting to just run out right now and buy them, and wanting to stay home and clean up a bit.
7my bf is cleaning the house :)
Do it in this order
>Clean shrine to ponies >Go buy ponies
Wish I had a bf to clean the house for me. :P

Wait, you're from the US right?
Americans are always surprised to hear that I'm not
Oh lol
Same issue here

On my end, always preferred speaking English instead of Spanish
Haha, really?

That riff
;_;
04Yeah
04I crafted mine

I have mixed feelings towards it
On one side, I really liked the movie and the song was just lulztastic
I hate the US too,but the movie was a satire of the US's attempts to be the police of the world.
I know, thats why I really liked the movie
Cool.

Fusion wasn't bad either
yeah, I liked fusion
Fusion had the SA-X
and the Fusion suit you could get into Prime :D
SA-X. the only thing I was scared of in GBA
*footsteps*
And i meant feminists that put women over men.
Those parts where you had to escape the SA-X?
the only had metroid prime and all I remember I was being scared of the phazon mines.
Was like "CRAPCRAPCRAPCRAPCRAP!"
and magic
Only saw the first one Prose
that too
BULLFREAKIN'HORSESHIT!

Yeah, running away from the SA-X was pretty nervewracking the first time.
Nothing wrong with feminism. Might be a misnomer, at worst.

>House talking about ethics
>Watch me
03well
03the reason why
03is there are two colors of them
03both exist on Dream World
03XD
mfw I hear the next boss in Zero Mission from the other room >.>
03my friend made me a Dream World hacker
...no
03I got 9 entire pages of Pokémon in like one minute :)
6o_o
6How?
RS, which boss are you at?
03Hacking.
03well not really
first
03I wouldn't call it hacking
hearing in next room? is that the wormy?
the worm, tunnelly thing
6What is it, then? ovo
03it basically just sends a script to the site
yeah
03that says "User completed the minigame"
03so instead of taking 90 seconds
03it takes like one
Him
03if that makes sense
6I see.
03but the other useful
03*thing
6Tell me if you get a female Wooper. :P
03sorta.
Wut?
???
....
also...timely missile upgarde
mfw
03It can't hack anything server-side
03but
03listen XD
03you know how you get 9 steps to find the island?
you guys never play metroid?
0___0
03so at most you'd see 9 Pokémon per trip, right?
WALL.E
"i told them WAAALEEE"
03well in reality there's about 20, each visit to the island
03they're just in random places.
that's pretty much how you kill each boss, lots of missiles to the face
6Yep.
whutwasdat wall.e
6o.o
waste allocation ... load lifter ,earth edition!
Sathi be trollan
oh, its his soundboard
6Golly.

13I wish I had more motivation to get points on DW
03unfortunately I can't share the script right now
it was Eve-a I thought
13sky/ocean please
03LOL
E.V.E., but walle said 'EEVAA'
:3
03see
FOREVEA
mfw he called her an idiot
03I got leveled up by my friend using his hack-script on my account
03he used to have to use some tools and do it by hand
03*ago
lol
wikipedia: "EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator)"
NO TIE FOR YOU
EdwardNewgate, have you seen the scene with the inhaler?
No
it's hilarious basically, but oh well

03I always find it weird how the Entralink calls it the Entree Forest
i heard it was attacked by cyberterrorists : <
Entra>Entry>Entree
Dman, its heaven.
7 Our old site is still down thanks to Hacktivist group "Anonymous Columbia"
mfw I watched the inhaler vid
6</obvious>?
its a darn shame really.
then the cyberpolice were called
compared to Hairi(nk)>Hairi>Hairu(tree)
cyperpolice are pretty active man.
03oh
i justed wanted to say
muh
03I was thinking Entree as in, the French word for meal o.o
:>
hello there :)

Body piercings on bacteria.

6Okay.
Well, it's an appropriate name for it.
Hn
:(
03LOL, imagine actually getting 9 pages of Pokémon a day
wouldn't the 4th be longer to leave room for the leg and the cannon?
03XD

Dunno if old news, but DAMN!

well, you can in certain situations
03yeah, like events, right?
iirc
and events, yeah
03inb4 using the hacking script on a demo account
I dunno, I mean she wouldn't be able to run as fast, for sure
13I mean other than events .w.
sure a power suit could comensate for that
echo II
I mean she could probably run and shoot, just not nearly as fast....
yea
maybe...maybe the suit would have a built in sling for when she needed to run and shoot? or it would drop a stand?
....why am I discussing the physics of a pony samus.
/me is back from college
Back-mounted gun
12I'm not going to risk that anyway xD
i thought of that ,but then went 'hmm...nah. it's ponies, they're not bipeds'
That would, of course, look absolutely ridiculous...
yes but i just caught my self joining in sort of a wait wut moment in my head.
good lukc then man
It always looks like that at the start and then I end up slacking off. :/
lol
No 7 straight hours? :p
I feel like Zero mission is babying me...actually telling me where I'm supposed to go? ppffft

have you SEEN the metroid prime suits?
It's boss but in 1337 speak.

Still, Assassin's Creed, Skyrim and Skyward Sword are coming out within like a week of each other. Not enough money, not enough time.
