lol
MEXICO
I want to play but I can't find the server :(
Is this game we're hearing being broadcast anywhere?
might I have permission to link a short (15-20 second) youtube video? :)
Chat is ded.
Java: TALK TO ME
I got kicked to do that before :(
TheBatman: Swear to you?
o.o
O.O
These voices...
Java: I don't know, I just want to play on the server, but i can't :(
No queue line?
TheBatman: It's full~
you can look it up on youtube if you are so inclined and yes they did dun it
You don't say?
I thought Valve implement queue system?
00,10ewww Celestia, every one knows Luna is better
The server is full.
Java: It did, but I can't find the server.
:(
Praise the Sun
haider.
Everyone's entitled to their own opinion. :)
TheBatman: Oh well, enjoy the video here
Psh Sumi. Chrysalis ftw
Java: Why do that when I can try to play? :(
13psh canary
13canary ftw :P
What about Cadence? :3
Since I love Dark Souls, I allegiance myself with Celestia.
Orause the sun
>/////< Oh hush you Shizu
oops
13<3
00,10princess LadyCanary, hmm has a nice ring
>__<
LadyCanary sounds like a superhero name
Sumica: agreed
Java: Funny you should say that!
it is?
Black Canary is my favorite DC superhero.
Pardon me as I go draw something~
LadyCanary: was about to say that lol
So that's how I got the name LadyCanary.
Like, I know that Sandyd's is the name, but the server isn't public or something :(
/me searchs for a MLP princess base
Black Canary is always awesome character. good thing DC don't screw her character yet
I KNOW Java :OOO
Java: yet
Ponies47: Go for a Celestia princess base. :3
NocturnalBlade: yet >:)
Gail Simone is the only writer I will trust with her. Among others.
maybe the server is friends only
Nah. I was kidding AJIsAwesome. I'm just messing around =P
fr4nky: D:
fr4nky: then how did that kid get on there?
Ponies47: okay. jpg
fr4nky: its full
I'm a silly pony~ :3
but it wasnt on the list then it wasnt full
So who will play Dark Souls 2 in their PaniniStation?
But I cant be a princess, Sumica. Wreky is best princess. ]:3/
well im looking at the players in the game and its full
LadyCanary: As Record_Discord, I remember that.
00,10lawl
these voices x.x
IKR?
Remember? I wrote Wrek as a princess when I got banned for liek 20 minutes
XD
SHHHH He might hear you
Fiiine
/me 13hoofs canary a mug of hot chocolate and a fresh muffin <3
Shizuka: I could use a mug of hot chocolate
and/or a muffin
Thank you Shizu! <3
I want a muff too!
Oi brb
Java: You smelled grandma's muffin, didn't you?
I'm content with my chicken sandvich
Java: i think you mean muffin :D
Ding ding ding
Banana Muffin!
It is
SHEIT
KILL KILL KILL
/me headdesk multiple times
00,10this is why I replaced my damage sound effect in tf2
RING RING RING
00,10also why I mute most players
the ding is annoing as hell
it's like nails on a chalkboard
SHUT THE FUCK UP KID
Sumica, replace the ding sound with Pinkie saying "fun" :$
Sumica: You've never even heard mah voice :p
Lol.
I like the ding.
^
Lol you don't sound your age Ponies47 XD
the ding aint too bad
please tell me these are randoms and not bronystaters, cause if the are bronystaters, im going to call them out saying how annoying they are
It's pretty bad
don't you hate it when some kid boast about being the best driver in halo and then completly sucks at it?
sooooo randoms? or bronystaters?
00,10I dont mind a damage sound I just cant handel the dig cause I play pyro
Derpy_Hooves: they is random lol
00,10ding*
My voice is deep for a 15 year old ^^
Derpy_Hooves: Are you talking about the chat room?
Hai Derpy_Hooves
how deep?
My damage sound is the one from Quake 3. Works perfectly
TheBatman: stram
Mine is DEEP.
STRAM!
Ohai Derpy_Hooves
00,10if you have ever had 5 things burning at once you would hate the ding
I have a DEEP voice for a 15 year old.
Sumica: Can't you change the ding?
I'm like a white James Earl Jones
Almost
00,10yes you can
00,10hence why i did so
But no one have a Depp voice when they are 15
ish
13me too
magmablock: A twist: you are the reincarnation of James Earl Jones
13much better ding from tribes vengeance
But he's not dead
13could link if ponies are interested
magmablock: Are you sure?
Yup
james ear Jone s is not dead uet
magmablock: Are you SURE though?
Same at you Java
Indubitably

Night all

Okay, what if I told you that I WAS JAMES EARL JONES?
night Maid_Major
/twist/
Or you are actually Jones Earl James
13ERMAHGERD MORK
Java: No, I'm James Earl Jones. Ask me anything.
TheBatman: He's not a immature person who can't read the rules for a website that's for sure~
/me dusts Shizuka
Ponies47: ... What are you insinuating...?
came back from an anime convention got this :D http://i46.tinypic.com/1qg7qo.jpg
TheBatman: Did you read the rules?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Nice!
Ponies47: Of course I have.
nice haul TheGreatAndPowerfulT ^_^
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: NICE BRAH
a lot of loots!
Nice TheGreatAndPowerfulT now get some frames! :D
i want pony merch too
TheBatman: Then what's one of them?
Ponies47: Mods have authority.
I remember a Brony who made wooden automaton of Fluttershy that sold for 1300 bucks
You took way to long to type that. Case closed you didn't read them TheBatman
Ponies47: Oh yeah? Don't troll.
THERE, THAT'S A RULE
Ok. How many times have you been told to stop the canterlock. Multiple and yet you still don't do it~
*do it
Ponies47: Fine, no more Canterlock. I dare you to try to break the capslock disease. It requires several years of therapy
Just follow the rules and you'll be fine~
^
If you don't
Your gonna have a bad time
Ponies47: Look, I can make tildes too ~~~~ T~T
can the both of you calm down, Ponies47 if he wants to break rules let the mods handle it :)
I can also reference memes. Fuck me right?
NocturnalBlade: I'm not fighting silly pony :3
i didnt say fighting
is that kid a brony or a random?
Hehe :$ http://fav.me/d5gwcet
Neither am I! (read)[Let's go bro]
fr4nky: random
either way, he's annoying
AdamTheDuck: Wahahahaha
fr4nky: Which kid?
AdamTheDuck: Dat's my terrible drawing O.O
in the game
AdamTheDuck: :D
I know, i am in game, which one
I made that! XD
The Pony is my OC Navy Numbers XD
Ponies47, yes you did make it :P
Ponies47: i like it :)
so i just tried mari0, its meh
Ponies47: You should take pride in your work. :D
the controls are a pain and portals onlt make it worse
twilight_sprinkle: its better with 4 people lol
fr4nky: I am in the game, which one is it?
I just found a diaper store called "Poopee Whoopee"
NocturnalBlade: maybe
Java: I just found a coffee shop called Java
the speaking Blazing_Beatz
twilight_sprinkle: watch the Rooster Teeth Lets Play of it, its hilarious lol
I sitting on an island called Java
Java: I am drinking JAVA
fr4nky: Not much help, im talking too....you mean Pie man right?
I'm gonna remake that at some point. But I might have one of the mods OC 's holding the ban hammer instead~
TheBatman: you drunk my island!
yeah Blank_Flank
NocturnalBlade: not a fan of rooster teeth
Java: You sank my battleship!
i mean Blazing_Beatz
Ponies47, make it Wrek XD
Ponies47: sounds good ^_^
TheBatman: but not my cloud
twilight_sprinkle: aaaw, still funny though lol
Java: And my axe
TheBatman: And my wife.... oh wait
Java: That's a fuckin' good milkshake
AdamTheDuck: Nah. I know all the mods want me gone. So I might make it were I'm surrounded by them and all of them are holding ban hammers~
TheBatman: I know ;)
00,10if you are meleeing the giant robots you are dumb and dead
Java: Oh wait, we already did this, din't we?
if you are missing the giant robot
yep
you should stop playing
Ponies47: I'm sure they don't want you gone. ._.
But this time with my waifu :p
Java: Lunaismywaifu.
no, not derpy :(
great, I need an emoticon that doesn't show pony
<3
Not Fluttershy too!
Take that emotion
igh
sigh
Why do they want you gone Ponies47? .-.
I feel like TF2ing but I don't want to leave you beautiful people
Kidding. I know there ok with me
Ponies47: Oh. XD
Being a silly pony as always :3
/me noms a slim jim like a fatass
/me noms a Kipkat07_Scarf like a fat fuck
No chat derping! DX
slim jim? what that?
If there's Slim Jim then why is there no Fat Jam?
fr4nky: Think of it like this... It's a stick of assorted animal parts stuffed into a skin. Tastes like Murica.
Whoever started PMing me. Send me another message
Egh, I never licked Slim Jim.
*liked
AJIsAwesome: I could never lick them myself either... Although I don't really like them either.
mmmm cildhood obesity....
fr4nky: Don't bother. They're not that tasty.
fr4nky: Obviously. Every 'Murican knows what they are.
tastes like blood clots
No thank you
Source: I'm Murican. I want to move to Canada.
I wanna move to the UK
Kipkat07_Scarf: are you sure?
What does the tape recorder machine do?
sapper
Java: Positive
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Brony 101: Leaving the Fandom
Kipkat07_Scarf: good luck then
Thanks, twilight_sprinkle. I like it. :)
my only problem is that I want to join the USAF
Kipkat07_Scarf: whats USAF?
thx
United States Air Force
My dad was in the Air force Kipkat07_Scarf.
mine was in the army and air force
Ok I love that latest EQD article
^
I still wonder why people always saying "Leaving the fandom" over the most trivial matter
Just watch and enjoy the damn show!
i think i wont leave it ever
Every era has its downside
^
Trust me, the 50s are not better
its the whole world
YOU CANT LEAVE. YOU ARE HERE FOR LIFE.
in the 50s there where no ponies
Kipkat07_Scarf: Then why don't you try helping making this country a btter place if you don't like it?
Living in the past does not solve the situation.
*better
Java: better than dubstep, unnecessary nudity, douches, etc?
its a lot harder getting in than out
It's us vs the world, always. Either you lose, or you say to the world "FUCK YOU! I'M A MAN AND I'M PROUD OF IT!"
I'M A MAN, AND I'M PROUD OF IT
>dubstep
Kipkat07_Scarf: Douches exist all the time
really Kipkat07_Scarf? dubstep is a crime?
Kipkat07_Scarf: You prefer to live in an era where showing a little cleavage will brand somegirl a whore?
Kipkat07_Scarf: We all do. Come away with me and my friends to a small, uninhabited island.
hmmm... yeah
Java can come too
Kipkat07_Scarf: So why don't you do something to change it?
cowvarkian
This era is good, racism are lower and we actually living in better life standard
AJIsAwesome: You're invited
eyjey said golden words
people today blame the world and do nothing about it
Unless we can get a country to convert to ponyism I doubt the world can improve
they act as though its evil and has nothing to do with them
true that twilight_sprinkle
but the world wont change on its own
You know, people who complain about something and don't DO anything about it can practically be just as bad as the people who are CAUSING the problems.
bbl guys ^_^
Im not going to be able to make an impact
Laters NocturnalBlade ^_^
Bye NocturnalBlade
moving to a different conuntry wont change the world, neither will it be better
twilight_sprinkle: climat :3
bye NocturnalBlade
BYe, NocturnalBlade.
hi all

Hi Mutterguy :3
Running from the problem doesn't help you, it just makes it worse.
well,i would probably prefer britains weather too, but still
Kipkat07_Scarf: you can kip, everyone help
/me gives up and goes back to his corner mumbling about the past
Kipkat07_Scarf: and even if you cant make an impact from above, then do so from below
kick the world in the dick?
...no
awww
Kipkat07_Scarf: If we need to.
tough love baby
i mean if you dont plan to go into politics and make an impact there, make an impact is an ordinary citizen, for individual lives
*as
I'm no Xenobiogeologist but i don't think the World has a dick.
and with the internet its easier to get your thoughts out too
Gaia is a she
twilight_sprinkle: Get our thoughts out... Fuck the police! I do what I WANT!
You must act within the boundaries of society in order for people to understand your ideals, instead of just forcing it onto them.
AJIsAwesome: Tell that to Jehovah Witnesses or Mormons...
Well... I could blow up Mount Everest. People would notice me then, and I could theoretically kick the world in the dick
Reminds me about the latest Fox News blaming the recent shooting on video games.
Again
The taste of wine is getting easier and easier to drink.
take*
Java: AGAIN.
TheBatman: AGAIN
Not on guns?
Java: AND AGAIIIN
Mutterguy: Remember me?
Mutterguy: Guns don't kill people, mentally damaged people kill people.
yep
Instead of complaining about the problems, we should be finding ways to fix them.
guns dont kill people, people dont kill people, loss of blood and damage to organs kills people
Blow shit up?
...yes, blow shit up
twilight_sprinkle: None of those things kill people. Joss Wheden kills people.
Kipkat07_Scarf vaguely
Assasinate dictators?
because games make you run amok -.-
Done that. Not effective
Declare war on the ocean?
it doesnt have to involve murder or destroying anything
welll more than vaguely but there is an quite of crowd here
fr4nky: Remember Legend Of Zelda? That game made me lose my shit. I chopped up a couple of plants.
Kipkat07_Scarf: Done that too, not effective
Kill the hippies?
like i said, just set good morals for yourself and set an example for others, and help others with their lives and morals
^
The hive of scum and villainy
Tried that
SHIT SHE'S DEAD
and if someone doesnt behave like you want, you mustnt give up either, and keep going
OH! I KNOW!! Kill all the profane rappers!!
Kipkat07_Scarf: that'll work
Kipkat07_Scarf: but not Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, those guys are the SHIT.
Java: There's always hope that it'll be better.
AJIsAwesome: I hope so.
or we could censor everything
AJIsAwesome: I need to be more positive
There must be something wrong with my headphones, because I can't hear a thing from this video.
they've had a chance to get better since the day they started
and they haven't improved so far
Off: do you hear this ping?
I prefer staying in Polygon for now
no
can you hear system sounds Off ?
Off: is your computer muted maybe?
hmm, possibly. I'd better check the control panel.
00,02ooo, there a spot avaliabe in the game?

Nah, they didn't have that much trouble with it.
You rarely see a spy in MvM
You really rarely do.
OHMYGODITSTEAMFORTRESS2
00,10yeah I know Ponies47 that is why i like it
00,02tried it on one of the normal modes iirc
Ponies47: How did it go?

/me repeatedly punches his cat
To bad none of those guys have high five taunts :/
/me repeatedly licks Kipkat07_Scarf
It's because it is rare to get in a crate or you have to pay £5 for it.
Unless you find one for a good trade.
AdamTheDuck: You not a duck. Your a dog! :o

Night yall
Goodnight?
Hellloooo~~?
Night
I feel so special
Yes, you should...cause I said goodnight to you
but... But... Where's everyone elese?
eh, idk
Like... Kipkat07_Scarf? Or Java?
Tell them I wished them a good night.
Meh.
k
lol
night
huh? whazzat?
:p
indeed
it's noon here
/me takes Kipkat07_Scarf to bed
/me squees
I haven't
I know
Java: neither have I
You replied tome
I don't go to bed until after the sun rises.
MURIKA never sleeps.
Soulless_DCLXVI: being a vampire suck?
my foot is asleep, does that count?
We always watch over the world, ensuring Communism doesn't try any funny buisiness.
im the last of the MURICAINS to sleep
I'm only 15. So I'm young and stupid and have lotsa energy :>
along with a few others
Java nice pun there. And I wouldn't know :)
Soulless_DCLXVI: At least you're not Twilight's vampire :p
SO thats what its saying...Sex Robot
Yeah. That WOULD suck.
:O these ponified emoticons make me smile
Who made them?
Damn that metal on metal clang is annoying.
no
/me cant stay up till past 0000 or he will pass out
thats the pings telling you got a hit
But yeah, it gets annoying when playing MvM
Still it helps you see damage and if you hit someone
in pings
Anyway to lower the volume of the ping or change the sound entirely?
you can lower the stream volume
No, I mean for those playing the game.
not sure
never really looked
I find it difficult to believe that TF2 is really popular if hitting enemies with bullets results in physical pain.
thats only if you have the ping selected
its avaliable to be turned off
I have to go sleepies :3
nighty
Oh. So you can turn it off? Allright, that's good.
Nighty night then Kipkat07_Scarf
night Kipkat07_Scarf
'Night Kipkat07_Scarf
/me joins Kipkat07_Scarf in bed
good night and all that jazz
sexy time?
Java: hell yea
Bronysith: I didn't know you swung that way.
yeah, you dont have to have the ping for damage, its only there for if you want to know if you hir something
Soulless_DCLXVI: love is blind my friend
True
until you hit a wall :p
/me grinds Java
Ponu up :)
-_-
Pony*
ponies up, mules down
face down, plot up
So many QWERTY typos. I wonder who here use AZERTY (not me)
So is this PvP or PvE?
MvM
it's a pve system
I'm unfamiliar with "MvM"
as opposed to the normal pvp deathmatch thats in tf2
MvM is Man vs. Machine
Mann
yeah
always forget that extra n
So PvE then. Why make up a new, more confusing acronym?
More fun that way?
because it's TF2 and MvM is the only PVE system thats in the game
excluding the training
Oh oh OH! The AI are all modeled after robots and unmanned vehicles. I see.
Lol, thats why its called Mann vs. Machine
Soulless_DCLXVI, indeed.
I can see why the ping would make sense then.
no..the pinging is for anything
So close
I use the damage ping in any gamemode
Soulless_DCLXVI, the ping also takes affect when hitting humans in normal mode.
twilight_sprinkle: What with Twilight "come tither" eyes?
Allright then.
Yeah, The Ping is used to tell you if a weapon of yours is hitting someone, and to show how much damage is being done
Java: *shrug*
G'night everypony! :)
night gildash
bye GilDash
Well, goodnight everypony. Ima hit the clouds

Go to bread Sumi ;3;
yes, I could go for some wrek arts
aw, i can watch this bear forever
/me quest: do a barrel roll
I just need that... juicy... wonderful.... stream key
so many damn hackers in ps2
JUMP
00,02hmm, my suspension appears to have stability problems
QUEST COMPLETED!
gdlk_ouo: not that many hackers bro
gdlk_ouo: just good players
and after all that you STILL can't open the truck
trunk
simon says jump
really i just saw how peoples start dying for no reason in place where they really can't
what is sumi trying to do?
idk
05a spawn room?
gdlk_ouo: team killing? infiltrators?
dat sound is so sexy
05did the base flip to an opposing faction?
or what wrek said
no it was ours
and no enemy infs there
05ive played the game since early beta
05ive seen 1 hacker in all that time
gdlk_ouo: team killing probably
05and i got him banned
i want my brainless stream back. what did i said?
I was playing TF2 the other day and this guy was hacking like crazy ;_;
lol
00,02my car exploded when i ran into the debris of a previous model XD
thats the downside of shooting game, ppl cant handle losing so they turn to hack
oh mornin' Wrek :P
Click it or ticket Sumica ;3;
whats hte plus sign next your name mean phase4?
maybe is something just was a render problem then we did'n see some enemies
00,02linkkirby, voice, i can talk when the channel is muted
virtually all actions in ps2 are ran through the server to check they are 'true', so youd have to be a hella skilled hacker to be able to kill the opposite team in there own spawn room
oh ok
i recorded video if you give a fuck, i can't really say it was real hackers or just some bugs
gdlk_ouo: what faction/server are you on?
terran
05soulero: i remember a glitch where on certain spawn buildings (this was before painfields) you could squeese yourself between 2 panels but you had to have a tank or sundy pressed agaisnt it
05and voila
05inside
brb
00,02this is totaly safe
Is the new Ace of Spades worth it?
but really i can't say it was real but it looks very strange then peoples just start dying around in room where no enemies units
Sumica is the greatest fire fighter ever! :D
I also can't wait for Street Fighter x Mega Man
i wonder if you call another will they come to you
00,02wonder if you could sheer the truck betwene two trains
Wrek, also yes i saw yesterday gates that stand near 2 meters of earth and you can just go under them
Sumica: take the train
you will most likely lose your head
this will work
inb4 fall
flawless
ded
Sumica should steal the train
00,02you interupted his dubstep
All da wubs
need song
soulero, justice, waters of nazareth
Sumica: take a minivan. ^_^
mad song
i didnt mean it like that d3rb- but, whatever
fine! i wont help anyone any more :P
GOOD!
now im gonna be a prick (more so) to everyone!
00,02d3rb-, i was wondering that actually, cause it sounds a lot like another song i've heard from hustice
00,02if only i could remember the name of that song
to winamp!
00,02nico is perplexed by this ledge
00,02why is there fuel in a show room car XD

00,10Well it was't realy an interview and we had more then one guest
AppleBloom: potato
Oh don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining in the least cause I still think its awesome that she would go on here
I missed the Interview :/
Good morning Bronystate
I just wanted more is all lol
Hello Gold_Demona
hi gold demona how are you
Ponies47: wut intervew
Mornin' Gold_Demona
hello Gold_Demona
morni Gold_Demona
I missed it too. T^T
AppleBloom: what time was it
/me hugs Gold_Demona
I was too sleepy to stay for the interview ;~;
geeky: 8:00am west coast time
It was right after the episode aired
how've you been Gold_Demona
AppleBloom: buck i was a sleep
00,10I woish they would update the rover mods though Phase4, they are kinda broken with the new pod layout
alexxm: I've been good, thanks. U?
i'm good Gold_Demona
Hasbro needs to get there (squee) together. The new episode that aired Saturday was leaked out on Thursday T-T
AppleBloom: wait 8 this mornin
geeky: yes
this song is funny
is this evanescense or however its spelled
AppleBloom: lol i slept till 1 in the afternoo
AppleBloom: no
00,02yeah, the rover mods are cool
geeky: I miss those days :'(
00,02wish they'd add some parts to the stock game
AppleBloom: online school for the win
Waking up in the afternoon... I remember what that was like...
geeky: I praise you, but despise you at the same time
00,02Sumica, what we really need is copy and paste, so you can construct individual components and paste them onto larger craft/launch vehicles
00,10yeah
AppleBloom: frinedameme
00,02gets anoying having to rebuild stuff all the time
is wrek using paint toll sai?
Yep that's SAI
It very fancy ^3^
Fanceh
/me holds up a cup of tea
/me puts on a bowler hat with a fake moustache
/me clanks AdamTheDuck's cup with water bottle! *Cheers*
I have it and still have much to learn about it. First of I all I need to get a tablet
*off
High sensitivity mouse ftw~
It's hard to draw with a mouse <.<
Ponies47: Where'd did you download it from? I dont trust the interweb for program downloads anymore lol
damn the cider went cold
AppleBloom: It was a gift from a friend of mine ^_^
Ponies47: lucky......
05currently enjoyign a ncie cup of molded wine
AppleBloom, official PaintTool SAI site? .-.
cold apple cyder is crap
AdamTheDuck: don't they charge though?
Yeah, $15 I think, can't remember
AdamTheDuck: 15$ or virus... weighing options here xD
AFK
If you pay for it I think it's worth it to be honest. It's worth it. It's 1000 times better than something like MS paint ^_^
i thought SAI was 70 bucks
00,10yeah it was defenatly noticeable to in the viewers numbers Ponies47 that the leak hurt us
Ponies47: I've been thinking about it, because for a hobby or side job whatever you wanna look at it. I design and paint guitars
i use pint lol
Ponies47: So a program to edit and paint my idea's makes my life 10 times easy, rather than sketching and drawing by hand
AppleBloom: i prefur sktch by hand
Sumica: I stayed up way to late the night before and slept in and missed it ;_;
geeky: I do too, but for tri color paint jobs I can always sketch those
AppleBloom: Yeah for something like that. Get it
AppleBloom: ah most my art is hand drawn and colerd and or painted
AppleBloom: u got a DA
Sumica: How big of a difference was the streams numbers compared to previous weeks?
00,1050%
geeky: Nah, I am too mervous about posting my work on sites. Just hate getting crituqed by non customers lol
nervous*
AppleBloom: ahh i got yah
Sumica: Damn. Like I said. Hasbro needs to get there (squee) together T-T
as a constant reminder of shame
My art is junk but I'm trying to get better
Buytoast: My art is made out of wood, fire cleanses all lol
Ponies47: lies its not junk
AppleBloom: im suer its better than fire wood
fire will never cleanse shame from our beings
that's why we must always have some
geeky: meh, I tried to replicate van halen's guitar design... I slammed my thumb in a car door as punishment xD
AppleBloom: o.... okay
/me gives AppleBloom matches
Was it me, or was spitfire's voice different today?
Yeah it was
i did not see the ep
im behind
I like her old one better imo
yeah, but new one wasnt bad
Frenchy: You can't. Nobody recorded it

i have been watichng to much Doctro who to watch MLP
geeky: is there anything wrong with doctor who? lol.
Frenchy: You missed everything. Sorry~
Ponies47: i'm so sad :S
AppleBloom: no
If xbox supported flash and I could stream from my xbox I would have recorded it
If you could recorded it and uploaded it, it could be taken down to violating rules.

Ponies47: i always keep faith in the fandom ^^
Gold_Demona: NEVER!

Whoops closed chat
What could there be in the fandom for you to have faith in?
Ponies47: Way to go.
Shut it Kammerjunk T-T
Buytoast: Well, call me old fashioned, but I have faith that we will one day worship the Sun and Moon as powerful gods.
And fear them.
amen

ashens is now 36
Who is now what?
00,10ok artwork in the same day as the ep I get but ffs plushies

Yup
Hell, a friend and I made a cuddly wuddly Ghast and Creeper in two.
...They ended up very round.
Thanks for the stream everyone :3 Now i must go read my 2 daily chapters of Fallout:Equestria :3

08,01i don't know; last night i felt a bit off, emotionally
:<
Sorry to hear that :c
08,01and this morning i'm having full blown depressive episodes and panic attacks
Cheer up lad
08,01i've tried taking some HTP-5, hopefully it'll help
HTP-5?
Im am bored
08,01Cheshire: it mediates seretonin production, i think
08,01it's a precursor for seretonin
05if you wish to watch :o
I wub wrekky art streams :3
All da awesome music :3
Maybe I should use the name everyone knows me by
easier than starting from scratch
AdamTheDuck: I knew it was you :3
05fun fact
05this sabaton album
05goes through the history of sweden
05how it became an empire
05and how said empire ended
05in chronological order
05from first to last song
Wrek: We had an empire?
05aye
hai
when? o.o
Wrek: Even Twilight of the thunder god? :P
05remember when we owned finland, denmark, norway and the balticum?
Oh yeah that
05during 1500 iirc
Ohai Havok
I'm not sure "conquering" our brothers would count as a Empire :p
owned...or pwned....I'll show myself to the door
More like...mi casa zu casa
/me hugs AdamTheDuck
It's funny...
500 years ago we would be at eachother throats.
Nowada ys...
We're all buddy buddy :D
The magic of friendship compels you!
05i woyuldnt mind norway denmark finland and island switched off EU and fromed the scandinavian union
05then again
05norway wont gain anything from it so i doubt it will ever happen
That would be a ....dream but a nightmare
05but it would be nice
Yeah Norway is pretty safe where it is
Good morning, everypony!
In many cases safe economy and things
Hiyo Pinkies4thWall
Good morning Pinkies4thWall :)

Wrek: And then we raid and pillage everyone yet?
05fins are a lost cause
/me enters sleep-ish mode
It's not THAT hard(Lives in Skåne, closest to Denmark)
Wrek: Not really, they are forced to learn Swedish in school
Weird
05Vordox: my dads from skåne so i dont have that hard of a time either
05but my friends up here
Wrek: I can almost understand Swedish half the time.
Goodnight Pinkies4thWall|Zzz

Lil_B: Wie ist Ihre Animation geht?
05keep it hush hush though ;)
/me takes Lil_B's monacle
Will do Wrek =3

Vordox ... please, for the love of language, stay english xD
I haven't sprechen deutch in 10 years
Give me a break :p
I gotta go get dinner going in my crockpot. brb :>
You may have my monocle, but you will never get my Top Hat Chrysalis !
i misread crockpot there...
lol same
Vordox the animation is going good, even though getting Internet has slowed down production xD, currently cleaning it up so everything looks fluent, , but 6/12 Frames are done, just have to add the Spear later
Great =3
How's tail/Mane going?
ALSO, I must say this
Eating Crisps with Fork with Dip...
was enticing and nice actually
Vordox Well, the Helmet prevents most Hair Stuff, and the Tail looks good /actually, the Tail animation is just 6 frames, and repeats itself twice during the 12 frames
Lil_B: Repeats itself?
You sure?
Hmm, so what are you working on Lil_B?
05hmm
05how about some...
Lil_B:
AdamTheDuck A Desktop Pony Animation, which Pony, or whos OC it is is Top Secret though
Hmm, ok.
Lil_B: You suck at keeping secrets secrets
:P
08,01Vordox: ich hab die animation von Lil_B geseeht
Vordox you too :P
XD
True...
08,01it was good
ist gutt, ja.
08,01and this morning i'm having full blown depressive episodes and panic attacks
08,01whoos

darubet wissen sollten...

Vordox who should know about it , Wissen=Knowlerdge, or to know
/me headbangs.
Lil_B: Ah, only 3
05vordox

05grandparents
05we should totally try and plan a meet of sorts
08,01oh sweden... http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20739778
Sounds awesome, if we ever have time
But a warning Wrek.
Introvert....akward akward introvert
Like Phase4 *1000
05introvert?
In real life.
I talk big on internet. But irl you know =P
05oh shy
Yah

Where's LadyCanary
She loves this song

But yeah sure, Someday Wrek
Unless you go to conventions, like anime
Wrek makes me hard.
Cool guy.
o.o
wow video game ads in the 70/80 were crazy
JRP2234: Actionpacked
JRP2234 yeah, they were really, REALLY strange
JRP2234: One of the reason it got shunned :D
Like Nerf Guns nowadays
Or Ga'k
LAWL
You're using derivates
....
Dat double kick :P
Vordox: You are surprisingly good at this.
I talk before I think
Yes, even writing is going unthought
...Does unthought exist?
I talk and write as I think of what I want to say.
And the backspace key is for the weak.
Kammerjunk: XD
Hmmm, I wonder Wrek...
Uhh I need to catch some sleep
Goodnight everyone. Enjoy Wrek drawing the eyes :P
Heard of the Gary Moore?

Whut Chrysalis ?
05these guys hsould be to your taste though Chrysalis

Chrysalis seems to be a heavy European Metal fan
if you didnt ban the word, i wouldnt want to say it XD
ok, ä works
Yup, got em from your megametalist
Lil_B: That's cheating :p
guys ebooks are shit
Lil_B gák works as well
spread the word
Vordox every derivat is cheating i think xD
PONIES!
<
Lil_B: Heh :P
right there
I second the notion of ponies
Yeah artist , Wrek is drawing
Chrysalis I only get a {?} xD
He's doing a Spitfire on Anneli Heed's request
wrek, mr super detail guy
<3 I'm happy(And surpised) That Anneli even wanted to become famous as a Brony
anneli? who?
Anneli Heed
The "other" Tara Strong
uh.....what?
Tara Strong = Brony Queen of USA
yeas i know
Anneli Heed = Brony Queen of Eu
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Swedish Spitfire
^ÄppelPaj
Vordox I think the Animation shrank in size during the animation, about 1 pixel less high and 2-3 pixel less lenght
<3 anneli heed
Lil_B: O.o What?
How'd that do?
Vordox: anneli heed, is spitfire?
Chrysalis: You heard her aftershow talk?
artist: Yes, the Swedish One
I got Annelis Autograph! Now I can... Pin it to the wall... I guess :/
a fair amount of it
ERHMAGEHR
artist: The famous "Äppel Paj" quote
then my girlfriend woke up
Vordox: never heard it
I'M TRYING TO BE INFORMATIVE HERE
Vordox: link it :D
/me throws gák at Vordox
in pm no?
Vordox It fit better with the Animation, but it's not noticable as long as you don't have the oiriginal Sprite standing really right next to her xD
/me dodges it
I'll PM it
Lil_B: That unforgotten rule :D
hmm, wonder what would happen if i were to code a gák bomb, like a hug bomb, but with gák
You... totally unforgotten Rule... ... ... I haver no Idea which rule you are talking about :?
Oh
"If the resolution is lower, you have less freedom, but doesn't mean you should take it"
wow I am kinda ashamed of myself forgetting that a new ep was out ill be back when im done
Basically, "a sacrifice" :P
<---- Dem Eyes
if you say "the word" 3 times, will you get banned? like FOREVER!
artist: TRY IT
*poofs off to the world of youtube and ponies*
Too fast Romm
Vordox: i didnt get it, the appel pai thing
artist: You don't get the Äppel Pie?
I tHOUGHT YOU WERE A BRONY
HERETIC
Vordox: eppel paiiiii
The word, the Word, the Word...
no, why is it "famous"?
Cause her voice
like, orgasmic voice? XD
Listen to it closely
Nah
Her accent comes through with a commanding voice
:p
Also, she's the Queen of Bronies in EU, also helps
SLUUUUUT!
heard it 3 times, still dont get it XD
Vordox my Spritesheet looks awful xD Behaded Sprites and Floating Head everywhere!
05this song was inspired by the movie alien
Vordox I'd object
Lil_B: It's the smart one
Lil_B: Having templates makes it easier
I don't use it though, I like each sprite being unique
None of the sprites I made are copied
Lil_B: Anneli started 1 and a half year after
Give her time.
<---- I still see no Wrek Desktop POny
;_;
The ONLY complete DP i have made
ijallfall sorins eppelpai

Vordox: neh, bot my pc
brb, SURFING THE INTERNET

Vordox I also drew all the animation myself, just things like the Head that basicly just change their Position, I copyed over to the next frame, or Copying the body and thanm erease the legs and drew them again, but I alsways had a previous running animation from the Desktop Ponies
05only way to get it to work would be if all draw animatiosn are in one big GIF
... why do I always Post L wall-texts when someones Pusy >.<
Why did you get the streaming software?
i dont get this creepypasta
05i think this is my fave raubtier song

Wrek: Why use xsplit?
XAX: yes, its a creepypasta aswell
05Vordox: cause the water makrs

http://i.imgur.com/O1ipu.jpg This one Chrysalis?
Wrek: This one song reminds me of Pökarpåsen. :p
JRP2234: I would pay a rediculous amount of cash to live there.

Hey Dark92Enigma
wb Dark92Enigma
que hablar conmigo para charlar
..............................................................................
/me glomps Dark92Enigma
RD, whats the problem? Why must you dot spam?
probaply looking for attention
What gave you the hint?
....
you did
>_>
I didn't give anything.
you sure?
Yep.
realy realy sure?
What tools did he download?
I'm really sure.
dat jaymoo
then you lost your memorie
What's a memorie?
memory*
-_-
alo?
What a shame. Too bad.
jemao!
What tools did he download? I really want an answer
jaymo
because you gave me your soul tbh
jaymoo ;_;
XD
What do you want aniderp?
JAYMOOOOO!
umm are you ok? D:
oh
I'm fine, and what do you want artist?
hi
Yeah hello to you too.
:L
Jmo, im suddenly curious. what does your OC look like? :P
I have no OC.
:O
^^
go to bed
/me hugs jaymoo
I don't see why you'd want an OC, anyway.
/me huggles aniderp|bestcakeever
my head hurts ;_;
my heart hurts
its fun
I mean, if you draw a lot or otherwise release a lot of stuff, I could understand, but most people don't.
mr widemouth
and it's because i cried at the top of my lungs
yesterday
I have a question concerning the stream.
Oh boy here we go.
Kammerjunk: But I NEED OC! I need black OC and I need to ship it with RD ASAP!
Kammerjunk: when my tablet stops freaking out. i am going to start on my tumblr ask thingie
so i do need one xD
Jmo: it's ok, you don't have to hear the whole story, and btw I'M. NOT. LEAVING. if that's what you think
I like OCs when theyre drawn, Using pony creator is just.... no, lol
Malavolent: It also needs to have dragon wings and reptilian eyes.
And a rainbow mane.
requesting to post non-picture material
And, of course, be an alicorn.
I wasn't expecting you to leave.
I like to use pony creator as a means to get together a color scheme and a basic design.
who knows how to speak Russian?:)
...I can say about three words in Russian.
That's how I came up with my OC. Once I had the basic design down I drew it from there.
what is this pony creator thou speak of?
That's a lie, about five.
My new computer can run skyrim on full graphical capabilitys fine but MINECRAFT the framerate drops lower than hell! Well that's what I have this old beauty for.
Wrek: requesting to post non-picture material
And not one shit was given.
indeed
Yup
Minecraft requires more RAM than you'd expect, if I'm not mistaken.
05gona BRB real quick
Jmo: oh, sorry.....my mistake........but you said: Oh, boy here we go......may i ask why?
05gotta get soem lunch
Sweet! \o/
Minecraft only requires alot of RAM if you're hosting a server.
Well still it is a 2.5 thousand dollar computer.
okie dokie Wrek
pfft
Have a good lunch
minecraft and alot of RAM
only when redstone
00,02cant very well answer it if you dont ask :P
i play it on high everything
<3 doing redstone
with 1GB RAM
who of Severck?
only when redstone i cant play
Jmo: oh, that was it :$
Jmo: Then what does it take a lot of? I mean, it IS written in a language like Java.
au?
Doesn't require alot of anything. It just depends on several things.
Aha.
1-2GB RAM, 512MB GPU, 2.4GHz~ CPU and you'll be fine playing Minecraft normally.
It's once you get more intensive into it you might require abit more of a system.
does anyone have seen the picture of my oc how it is currently? the person who is drawing it for me gave me this update picture how it currently is
Fair 'nuff.
requesting to post non-picture material!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
But hosting Minecraft servers, you need to feed them RAM.
who know Russian?:$
omygod do i try"
What tools were downloaded to produce such picture?
o my god do i pray
anyone wanna see?
Snow: Show me.
yes
its not done yet http://i.imgur.com/UeLfz.png
Yup, it's a OC.
wrek died
No shit.
wrek went to get lunch
What'd you think it was gonna be?
oh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4
Jmo: <-- didn't get the joke.
hsit
I don't see anybody laughing.
ha
you risked a kick/ban for THAT vid?
*facepalm*
Jmo: You should look better.
00,02not sure what you meen
I am looking.
00,02oh, the drawing?
00,02i'm actually elsewhere, not watching stream, Zacklego: i belive this is sai paint tool
aww
Jmo: Try opening your eyes while doing that.
:D
My eyes are open and I still can't see anyone laughing.
So shit luck mate.
Open your eyes and see... Your eyes are open...
NO SHIT
Wear no disguise for me... Come into the open...
Jmo: Dunno how about you, but my eyes see that they're taking the hobbits to Isengard.
Pffft
When it's cooooold... Outsiiiiiide.... Am I heeeeere... in vaaaaain!~
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9Uz1icjwrM
That unallowed link
Gold_Demona: When there are no mods, who can punish you?
I'm jsut sayin'...
just*
I know.
Since when has the rules about links became so strict?
he/she's just sayan
They always have been.
^
i know the program but i would like to know what tools he uploaded into sai
Well the mods never really banned everyone who dared to post a link.
They only kick people who do it, unless they spam the link.
Then they'll earn themselves a ban.
Strange,
I've never got kicked for that.
Strange how? It's just courtesy
Nevermind, a rule is a rule.
yup
Also, mods are asleep, post pony links.
It's fine when there's no stream going on, but right now there is
chat suddenly fell silent
Yup
I just got here
/me gives Gold_Demona muffin
Yey!~ Muffin!~ :D

Last night was the most interesting chat i've had in a long time
Aka, Spiderman 60's flooded the chat
XD
Dis Nittany_Discord <3
Holla everypony! :)
Morning, GilDash
Hello GilDash
GilDash: Evening (from where i live)
this is wondeful art of me
I take it rek was impressed by Spitfire in this episode. To tell the truth, I prefere the friendly laidback personality when shes not a flying instucter. I guess running a flight school/boot camp you have to put on a tough appearence.
Afternoon GilDash
hey guys
*Glomps Gilash*
hi depy :P
didnt spitfire used to be laidback in her previous apperances
Mmmhmm
She is
Spitfire? I approve.
Mmmhmm
/me hugs Rex_Mundi back.
Spitfir *drools*
Hai alexxm
She's just putting on the tough appearance for a flight instructor i guess
how've you been DerpyMuffins
She's got to be a hardass to keep the other cadets in line, obviously.
eah, her true personality is kind and laidback
GilDash: agreed.
Alright you alexxm?
Problem is it seems like in the episode she had never met Rainbow Dash.
IKR?!
Ikr i thought that too
It's almost like they wrote the part for someone else and then went, "Hang on, let's use Spitfire."
I said that exact same thing
She can't show favortism
GilDash: She cant treat Cadets she knows special
i'm good DerpyMuffins
Yeah, but she can at least agknowlage them
DerpyMuffins: True, but she doesn't even acknowledge that they've met. I would have thought she would have brought it up after Dash stormed off..
WAit
I didn't see anything odd about the way she acted. She was just being a drill sergeant.
Has it been 24 hours yet?
Just.
yah watching mlp too
I can't connect to servers on TF2 anymore.. :|
Like literally, by 2 minutes.
^
2 minutes ago
So, does this episode prove that flight squads like this are some sort of Military/
Flight squads usually are.
Seems like it
<_>
So GilDash, we sure did have the conversation yesterday eh? :D
I see the Wonderbolts as like the Blue Angels here in the U.S.
Honestly I think they were looking for an excuse to do a Top Gun reference
6_9
MadSurge: Oh trust me, I've had longer conversations about much weirder stuff too. XD
They're a small elite branch of the Air Force who also do awesome air shows
What if... The woderbolts acadamey is actually a military academy?
Why, was there a Top Gun reference?
Rofl.
/me never saw that movie
Jaaaaymo~
I never saw Top Gun
MadSurge: Cuz Top Gun references is funny? :P
Allo Fluffeh
The entire episode was a Top Gun reference
Not sure if it's an academy for the military or just the Wonderbolts, but in a way that influences cadets to join the military.
Wrek, this Spitfire is sooooo se-... makes me happy!<3
/me nuzzles jaymo and gives him cookies
/me huggles AssaultWithEmbraces
adorable
/me has never watched Top Gun, so meh.
Gold_Demona: no, were there Top Gun references? I didn't see that movie
Heya thelonepony :)
Ohai MLP_Brovakiin :)
I heard of topgun. never seen it
AssaultWithEmbraces! <3
I prefer the A-Team refrence in the Babs Seed episode
MadSurge! <3
MadSurge: No direct ones that I can recall. Other than the whole episode being kind of like it. =/
Top Gun's a good movie. I highly recommend it
Not sure I can stand that much Tom Cruise. XD
And afterward, I recommend its parody. Hot Shots :D
god those eyes
I don't really get the hate for Tom Cruise aside from how he is outside of the movies. As an actor he's not that bad. =/
Ughh.. i hate having to get upp :\
Isn't Top Gun just "jointheArmyjointheArmyjointheArmy" for a movie's length?
In any case, Spitfire had a different voice this eppisode, I liked the older one better.
MadSurge: Join the Air Force, but yeah.
I think most people preferred Spitfire's original VA from season 1.
Air Force ≠ Army
Gold_Demona: shows how much I care for modern war assets :D
I prefer Sweedish Spitfire
Afternoon everyone!
brb joinging the Roman legions
Morning YokusaHHart
Applepiiiieeeee
They should get Swedish Spitfire to to English Spitfire.
^
Phase4: Mind help me out here?
I like Wrek's new desktop pony :)
Morning YokusaHHart :P
Geez I love Spitfire
Why does swedish Spitfire get hate anyway?
English Spitfire with a Swedish accent? That'd be funny. :D
Heya YokusaHHart :)
Polish Spitfire ftw
MadSurge: Who hates Swedish Spitfire?!
Nopony hates Swedish Spitfire
Man, that last song reminded me of that really wierd PMV
Rex_Mundi: Exactly.

Hello everypony!

Wrek is a Glorious Faggot
Aww, I was expecting an epic battle to the virtual death
Love445: http://nextlol.com/images/2173-my-detector-is-off-the-charts.jpg
agreed
Installing Paint.net.
Love445, watch your mouth.
Has the fandom decided on the ship nickname for Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash? I find those cute names amusing.
you mean my fingers?
Lighting Dash, Rainbow Dust.
Dark moon ur faggot detectors invalid
No more words Rex_Mundi
I bet you, I BET YOU that there is already R34 if LD and RD
How is it unvalid?
It wins
no discussion of R34
Alright. As much as I love this Infected Mushroom, I gotta go for a few hours. Stay cool, please.
ur faggot detector is ran by a clone spiderman
Bye Kandarihu
BrightPage: This is the internet. The episode was even leaked, so I bet it was out before the episode aired.
:)
Infected Mushroom?
We'll try
05*sigh*
i am the real spiderman.
/me gasps
Kandarihu: See ya! :)
True GilDash
Wrek gives up.
Whats up Wrek?
What's up? Can't you see the idiots in chat?
http://i.imgur.com/JrcMb.png forget RD and LD, this is the new OTP
Bye Kandarihu :)
Maybe geting a drink?
Or a sandwich?
MadSurge: lol
*pats wrek on the back*
Wrek's just swiging Mjolnir around, obviously.
I know that feel
That drawing is amazing
GilDash: :D
Yeah, its lovely isnt it?
Why can't i draw like that D:
_Dark_Moon_: wait until it's finished! :3
MadSurge: That is best pairing ever. XD
Dat feel Dark I know it well
Cloud Chaser and Roid Rage? XD
Gold_Demona: Ikr :D these are the only pairings I approve of
05some people huh?
Roid rage X cloud chaser?... Naaaaahhhh
I much preferred Rarity and Thunderlane.
I can't stop laughing at these spiderman 60's memes
GilDash: RareThunder
GilDash: boo :P
They're from /b/, hows the make you feel?
that*
05hm?
Just gotta ignore them and keep moving forward Wrek, tis the best thing to do in my opinion
good evening all
Hi ekips
o hai
MadSurge: Pffft, bet you approve of FlutterMax as well. :p
Hey guys! ^_^
xx
TwilightSonata: Holla! :)
Rommulus: Do you ever feel bad for killing Remus?
Hi TwilightSonata
Heya TwilightSonata :)
GilDash: max? O.o
Huh, another Aussie.
yey :[
so many kickbans
Doesn't surprise me.
wreks on a roll
Kickbans?
Huh?
MadSurge: Sorry, FlutterMac. XD
Rex_Mundi: He had it coming, you should of seen the things the historians didnt find out about.
What's with the string of kickbans today? O_o
GilDash: Big Mac gets all the ladies
rule breakers, they never learn
Trolls enter. Kickbans ensue. Not really a hard concept.
MadSurge: Pffft, Braeburn any day.
Stupid router
I must not be paying enough attention to the chat...
Gold_Demona: some genius is calling Wreky a homo :(
Go home and be a family man..
What's happening again?
I hope we see Lightning Dust again. wait... what about Gilda X Lightning Dust? LightningGilda?
*pulls out walking stick* back in my day, trolling actually required more effort than just randomly insulting people with synonyms with "gay".
MadSurge: Missed that entirely. The dummy. >=/
I gotta say that Wrek has some interesting taste in music
Rex_Mundi: Pffft, my name's half done anyway. It's be GilDust, obviously.
Rex_Mundi: Gildust?
Gold_Demona: people still using "gay" as an insult :|
lol yeah
< I mean, come on. The template is right here. XD
GilDashDust?
GilDash: :D
GilDashDust... that'd be interesting to see...
"gay" is so outdated as an insult. I prefere the original olde Tyme usage of it.
Rex_Mundi as in everypony is gay when ponies come on
tradtional meanings
having a gay old time
make for awquard sentances
Rex_Mundi: as in Gay = Happy
05what i find funny is
then again, there is the song based on the differences
05takign time organizing people
05changing proxy
05over and over
05and all i gotta do is rightklick/klik
05and voila
lol
I know, and it was such a pathetic attack. XD
GilDash "attack" isnt the right word
not really an attack
Why do they even bother showing up :P
more like a light tickling
cause its far more amusing than anything
A poke maybe?
wa happend
dat black screen
05a silyl filyl that got pissed at me yesterday
05for kick/banning him when not abidign rules
05so
05hes been trying to botehr me since yesterday
yah im back
That's sad
It was an 'attempt' at an attack. It was just so shit you can barely recognise it for one.

_Dark_Moon_: thats why i ask all the time... where you here on thursday by any chance? :P
if you break the rules when wreks around
your gonna have a bad time
You're*
What's up everyone
Pizza when you french fry..
u gonna have a bad time.
just saw the new ep
_Dark_Moon_: i'll take that as a no
_Dark_Moon_ wth?
:P
isnt the new ep still under spoilers?
Oh sorry thelone, no i was'nt.
ah, out by like a minute
No, spoilers lifted half an hour ago.
Chrysalis: nope! LET'S TALK!
Chrysalis: it is till 24 hours after air time, which just have passed I think
Yay!
yeah it would of just finished airingh
We were *just* within the threshold when we started talking about Spitfire's new VA. XD
was never clear on that, is it 24 hours after it starts, or 24 hours after it ends
I watched the new episode 3 times yesterday
I think 24 hours after it starts
see i would assume 24 after it ends
in either case, the time has elapsed
imo the new ep had a huge ptential, but didnt quite use it. It was a decent ep none the less.
so we can all go, "finally the RD ep is over so we can watch more important ponies"
actually, i need to ignore tom
Oi, I like Dashie.
There we go, maybe this time i wont get the ep name spoilt
Sudden urge to play RE6..
this music, makes me want to jig
Alchemist: still might be the weakest episode of the season for me... goood episode nonetheless
and i can't jig
MadSurge: it surely didnt have much impact.
It was better then the season opener.
Though to be fair, Spitfire, so I'm biased.
yeah, spitfire was awesome
GilDash: well, the season opener had some lore building, and maybe a bit foreshadowing.
Alchemist: Yes, but that was all of 5-10 minutes of about 40.
yeah the opener did feel more like setup than selfcontained
And so far we've seen nothing else interact with it yet.
05i liek this song
If there's an arc, it'snot arcing very well.
/me jigs
What is this building up to? AAAAARRRGH
WTH is wrong with my space bar?
05srsly
05this song
05:D
I imagine this song might make more sense if I knew Swedish?
Howdy y'all!
who wants o go o he rainbow factroy
Heya Everlasting_Joy :)
Good, I didn't miss the drawing :).
Howdy MLP_Brovakiin!
Hi Everlasting_Joy :)
Howdy thelonepony!
Everlasting_Joy: Holla! :)
Howdy GilDash!
Hai Everlasting_Joy
GilDash: I know I saw you on the other day, but it's been a while.
Howdy AssaultWithEmbraces!
BOO! haha did i scare you
Hiya
no
/me slaps kidzrul732
Okay, he comes in, says it's been too long, then buggers off. XD
Site crashed, I'm back.
Everlasting_Joy: Tsk, running away? XD
GilDash: >_><_<...
Everlasting_Joy: Aye, too long. I've been busy but hopefully I'll be more available now. :)
GilDash: :), I know that feeling.
i like poptarts
Everlasting_Joy: You seen the latest episode?
GilDash: Yep.
Everlasting_Joy: Thoughts?
dis band :D
I like to put chocolate on my pizza!
kidzrul732 is it a cookie dough base?
with red icing for saure
sauce*
and white chocolate cheese
Chrysalis: That sounds awesome.
GilDash: It was solid. It's not my favorite, of both S3 or over all, but I enjoyed it. I do have to give big props to the ending, that was awesome to watch.
Chrysalis, I guess you could say that
I want one.
GilDash ikr
you could chop up gummi worms for pepporoni
Everlasting_Joy: I know, right? I don't think it was my favourite S3 either, despite Dashie being my favourite pony, but that Spitfire...
05"wherever in this world i turn, i stand here with empty arms, waiting for somebody to save me"
Chrysalis: We need to get on this for 2013.
05basicalyl this sogn in a nutshell
GilDash: What of Spitfire?
Wrek sounds so sad :(
Everlasting_Joy: She's... awesome?
Chrysalis: If we can get hold of him. XD
GilDash good look there
GilDash, I am ok with Spitfire, I think her drill seargent self is another side of her personality we just hadn't seen before.
^
^^
Chrysalis: Exactly. We might want to wait until later. XD
RainbowAsh or just put on for the recruits
RainbowAsh: I think that's the point. She's a hardass on the recruits but a nice pony when she's off-duty.
There's a difference between military life and civilian life.
The way I see it, she was just doing her job with the drill sergeant bit.
05it is a sad sogn Chrysalis :o
I bet she thinks of how hard she is on them sometimes. I can see her sitting down with a glass of Applejack Daniels and feeling sorry for herself. XD
/me passes flaggons of mead around
I don't think so.
mead is gooooood
I don't see Spitfire as that squishy of a person
just realized something, did we see Spitfires Cutiemark?
We should have.
probably at the end
Rex_Mundi: Yep, and it was awesome. ^_^
She may think about whether she was too hard on her recruits or not, but in the end her job is to weed out those who can't make it.
letme just get teh ep up
Gold_Demona: Everyone has a bad day.
And yes, we did see her cutie mark
Rex_Mundi, I am so starting up VLC to look it up right now
GilDash: Yeah, but I don't think she'd go feeling sorry for herself over it.
Heck, it's better to weed out the chaft and take the wheat.
[13:52:00] <Snow> evolves into a mothaf*cking strong thing
DAMNIT
Rex_Mundi, A flaming wing. Spitfire's cutie mark is a flaming wing.
http://theadmin.co.uk/NewImages/hCL89G.jpg
If the recruits aren't up for the challenge, they are than presented the ability to go home, before they hurt themselves.
wut
looks like a flame?
why the ping Chrysalis?
https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=231730606960417&set=a.202672753199536.52391.202672286532916&type=1
Cause he derped.
Snow accidentle copy paste
there is a point early on when she is talking to rainbow dash or just got done talking to her, I can't remember. but she is hovering and flapping her wings. so you can get full view of her mark
Chrysalis, or maybe an owl on fire. I definitely see a wing shape there, but there is a bit at the bottom
They need to do her with her hair down.
Like proper off duty, out of uniform.
does Wrek need the CM?
spitfire_01
spitefire in this shot http://theadmin.co.uk/NewImages/Nanqcs.jpg
http://images.wikia.com/mlp/images/6/69/Spitfire_yelling_at_a_stallion_S3E7.png i found a pic of spitfire's cutie mark
05SpeccyRush: the one i have is so blurry so sure, pm me it :)
dat browse url
Derp.
Wrek http://theadmin.co.uk/NewImages/hgBpoe.jpg
Maybe she has a phoenix cutie mark?
theres a really clear shot
It does kind of look like a phoenix, actually.
and then I blow all previous pics out of the air with this http://derpiboo.ru/183403
brb
SpeccyRush thats someone re-drawing it though
not from the eop
ep*
kinda cheating
looks just like the one from yours
GilDash, in that it's a flaming bird, yes. But phoenixes in MLP have a longer body, I think.
05a bird eh?
05thought it was a branch with "fire" leaves"
Hiyall
It is SpeccyRush.
RainbowAsh: Like I said, kind of like a phoenix. It looks like it's wearing a crown as well. XD
NightFury: Holla! :)
actually i do see the bird now its been mentioned
SpeccyRush has the correct one, I think
What if it is a breath of fire? You know, like spit fire
Oooh livestreamed drawing C:
it looks like a flaming wing for me
hey everypony
whats going on
Hi AssertiveFluttershy1
this song
is rather upbeat
indeed
RainbowAsh: Can we get her some flaming sambucas and try it out? :D
how are things AssertiveFluttershy1
not bad
Hi AssertiveFluttershy1
bin awhile since I was on here
Hai
GilDash, maybe that is how she got it
Snow: Looks more like a Phoenix to me
Catchy song by the way :)
ikr
RainbowAsh: Can we try and find out?
Spitfire cutie mark story?
GilDash, go right ahead. Don't expect me to stand in front of her, though.
CMC get on it!
wha?
hmmmmm
RainbowAsh: Who said anything about standing in front of her? I'll be enjoying the view from behind. ;)
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
interesting idea
Spitfire cutie mark story...............
Chrysalis: She always wanted to be a Wonderbolt, and had a firey personality to back it up.
:)
ohai DWR
Soarin' should've been there as well. It'd be nice to see the most well-known Wonderbolts cutie marks.
Hey Chrysalis.
I think i prefer cartmans version of this song
Chrysalis: I don't give a crap about whales so you can hug a tree
Chrysalis: Her mark represents her passion behind her desire to defend Equestria and her hot-headed attitude as an officer.
E_J|Homework, she doesn't appear to be exceptionally hot-headed, though.
05dont ask me how i found these covers
i find littlekuribohs version of this song funnier xD
do like this one though
RainbowAsh: Just a thought, but yeah, I can see that angle.
Wrek: Any chance you went to Google and typed in "pokerface cover"?
Wrek how did you find these covers?
You know this is getting ridiculus.......... I excpected alot of fan art of lightning dust maybe even rainbow dash....... Instead I look up the episode and I'm greeted with a torrent of sexual spitfire images!!! :P
I don't think Spitfire's hot-headed, really. That's more a facade for the recruits. I can see her being very passionate about her job and duties though.
^
oh wow.... this cover
well, i gtg bronystate. fries are ready
also, Wrek you made me spend money :( I bought Van Canto last night
Take care Snow!
thanks for the stream Wrek
'night snow
Bye Snow. Enjoy your fries
later
Can we have Dope's "You Spin Me Right Round" after this? XD
I think most of the peoblem here is people mistaking her on-duty attitude with her off-duty attitude.
Bye Snow
Bye Snow :)
Snow: See ya! :)
Being a drill sergeant, she has to be all business.
o_O
But it's not a phoenix. >.>
wait
ck
im back
WTF
Gold_Demona: Let us plant our epelliptic trees, damnit!
Oooook, whatevs
Gold_Demona, it doesn't look like Philomena, but maybe they are different kind of phoenixes, like with ponies or dragons.
Wrek: You ever played Vanilla WOW?
RainbowAsh: It doesn't look like a phoenix at all. It just looks like fire that's kinda shaped like a wing.
And only kinda
To me it looked more like a fiery wing or fiery flower, just my opinion
Gold_Demona: Well, I thought it looked like a phoenix when I first saw it, so there. :p
Hey, how did Spitfire get that tie on?
Did you play Vanilla WoW Wrek? =3
Though I also thought it looked like an autumn leaf at one point. XD
Gold_Demona, the lowest part could be the body of a bird. But yeah, at the beginning I thought flaming wing, too.
05started late vanilla
DerpyMuffins: You know what, I don't know and I don't care, but it suits her.
GilDash, that wouldn't fit her persona at all, though.
Wrek: I wonder, do you remember a certain Overpowered Orc NPC?
RainbowAsh: I know, that's why I dismissed it. XD
But if you look at the closeup of it, it just looks like fire...
Eye of the beholder...
umbarelllllla
http://derpiboo.ru/183403
GilDash, it would be an interesting angle to have some ponies with unifitting cutie marks. "So my special talent was diaper changing. But I said fuck that and went to the foreign legion."
Seriously, look at this
you know, this is a good cover
05hmm
05no
05i dont
RainbowAsh: Well, just because you have one thing you're good at doesn't mean you can't do other things as well. Generally though, cutie marks are supposed to represent what you're good at AND what you like doing, so you'd likely make a job of it if you could.
Hence "special talent" and not just "talent"
GilDash, on the other hand, Rarity's cutie mark is tied to her gem finding spell, not to her dress making.
RainbowAsh: Again, depends on the pony. She uses her talent to help find gems for her dresses though, so it's still used to an extent for her job.
GilDash, I see your angle. What then, if some event makes a pony turn away from their special talent, because bad memories are tied to it?
RainbowAsh: "Cutie Mark Failure Insanity Syndrome."
FUUUUCK
YOOOOOOOU
GOOOOGGGGLEEEEE
lol
They deleated a 7 year old video
THAT I LVOED
loved*
Even from BEFORE YOUTUBE existed
you mean youtube?
You know... SPitfire's cutie mark could just be based on the contrail she leaves when she flies.
damnit video.google.com
or not
you know after working on so many shows
this song actually appeals to me
Like how Rainbow dash's is rainbow
its goood
Vordox: what was the name of the video?
High Overlord Saurfang gets MC'd
Vordox, download what you like. You never know how the net will be tomorrow.
GilDash, I can see why they would be an unhappy pony... but insane?
Gold_Demona: Maybe... what was Lightning Dust's cutie mark? She left a lightning contrail...
It's lightning with some stars
RainbowAsh look at Screwloose's cutie mark
Her talent is being insane
DerpyMuffins, is that the pony in the discord episode or the one in the Dairing Do one?
Daring DO
It was Screwballs in the Discord one
The one in the Discord episode is called Screwball
I just realized we're listening to Tenacious D. O_o
GilDash, those are acute reactions when they can't make their talents work. But what if a pony decided to never try their talent again?
Videoklippet är inte längre tillgängligt eftersom det YouTube-konto som är associerat med videoklippet har avslutats.
YOOOOOUUUUTUUUUUUUBEEEEEE
DerpyMuffins, maybe she used to be a contractor and had a terrible accident.
RainbowAsh: If you never did anything you liked again, what state would you be in? Severe depression at the very least.
Then how do you explain Screwballs's cutie mark RainbowAsh
It's been totally deleted from the internet...
Wow...
After 6-7 years. ;_;
hai bronystate
One of my favourite nostalgia videos. :'(
RustyMeat: Holla! :)
Hi RustyMeat
Vordox: What vid you bitching about
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsCHIKTRYRk
?
Heya RustyMeat :)
Vordox: that means you have to go to every site to lool for that video :P
Hi RustyMeat :)
WHERE'S THE CHEETOS
look*
CrystalPhoenix no vid links during stream
CrystalPhoenix: That's a stream
there's a stream>
?
refresh
Yes
GilDash: A very famous WoW video from the Old days of WoW
ustream mixed me up
well sorry for that
GilDash: One of the best edited videos ever made from a hijinx(Before everyone started to do videos)
DerpyMuffins, the crazy pony's cutie mark from Read it and Weep is just a screw. The discord one got a screw and a ball, but she might as well be a creation of discord himself.
Vordox: I'm sure it's out there if you search hard enough.
E_J|Homework: You're talking to someone that goes through EVERY WHERE
Including other languaged websites
RainbowAsh: That's different if you grow out of it. You've got the time to see yourself getting worse and can mentally compensate and prepare yourself. If you stopped, immediately, for a reason that emotinally affects you so deeply, it would have bad reprecussions on your psyche.
When I say it's dead and gone.. it is =P
What if your special talkent was prostitution?
talent
you know, i want to coin a new phrase
Theres a fic for that
Chrysalis, I am liking that idea.
because no matter how messed up the conversations here get
DerpyMuffins: Well, we don't even know if it's illegal in Equestria.
theres always a fic about it
this ar is amazing
Chrysalis, bonus points if you are read well enough to also provide a title.
Can't remember i'm afraid
i remember it involved celestia
Oh, I got it
so Wrek ... gonna include some Äppelpaj maybe?
someone needs to do a training montage for AJ/RD with this song
Spitfire is awesome
This sounds like a Stan Bush song.
wow, the eyes look amazing
Drew this is wrek, thats a given :P
RainbowAsh: I'd be surprised if they were completely healthy after it. We could be seeing PTSD and worse.
stream dead?
/me HALO jumps into the chat
Died for me
hiya
D:
back up
refreshing helped
D:
Btw, what do you think happens to Lightning Dust now? Is she going to be thrown out, or just a stern talking? My head canon is that she and RD just switch places as leader and wingpony.
/me tackles Kipkat07_Scarf >:I
she got kicked out
ripped uniform and everything
:)
GilDash, yeah. Giving up your talent could well be a symptom of PTSD, if the traumatic situation involved it.
Well, turns out I don't have it
But it's about a pony with a cartoon dildo as a cutie mark
Woah, wut
RainbowAsh: Or it could be the trigger for it. I can't say I have a good understanding of psychology, but I know everyone's different and we all break down differently.
Thats a little more detail than is allowed in this chat...
Chrysalis, but wouldn't that be a bit much? After all she did not even get a single warning.
lol, this song
RainbowAsh so? she messed up BAD, and ponies nearly suffered really bad for it
and she showed no remourse
5 ponies could of died from the last mistake.
hey guys. i see Wrek is painting
sad realism but true
GilDash, if you decide not to do your talent anymore out of your free will, that can't very well be traumatic. If you are forced to, on the other hand, that would be a possibility.
implying fluttershy wouldt have rememberd shes a pegasus all thre way down
Theres a fic for that
hi Chrysalis
heya FlutterMEDIC
4 of them then.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Remix/Vocal Music: The Changeling (Ozzwald's VIP) / Trixie's Return / Through the Night
Chrysalis, she was encouraged by Spitfire all the while, though. Also, I think they would give her a second chance on account what she could do with all her power without proper guidance.
Hi FlutterMEDIC :)
RainbowAsh: Well, it can. You might have something of a "I'm shit at this, why am I doing it?" and decide to give it up. That's hurt you pretty deeply.
Lol new R34, there is a fic for that, no exception
Heya FlutterMEDIC :)
you can't do anything with power if there is no will to control it
I love this song <3.
I dont think the option for wonderbolt is open any more for her however its not like she has been kicked out of all aspects of flying.
Thank you Sakojima5555.
GilDash, I don't think you would get PTSD from that, though. It might already be a symptom of a depression, though.
You are now imagining this song killing the aliens in mars attacks instead of the aweful yodeling!
you are now imagining pink elephants
Lmao
There is a fic for that
Rommulus, I think she would have problems fitting in with a lesser flight team. After all she has the skills and the drive to be on top.
Chrysalis: on parade, too!
You are now breathing.
AssaultWithEmbraces DAMN YOU
RainbowAsh: I'm not saying you'd get a specific kind of disorder, just that you wouldn't be mentally healthy after such an event.
i hate that one
Chrysalis: :D
AssaultWithEmbraces: http://i.imgur.com/GolOX.png "Be?":D
GilDash, what if your cutie mark was terrible? Like a talent of stealing from old ladies? I think you could learn to give something like that up and be contend with it.
MadSurge: What's the "Be?" for?
RainbowAsh: I think the show tries to preach that your cutie mark also depends upon your perceptions of it. It could mean one sees it as one thing whilst the actual bearer sees it as something else, and that is what the talent actually is.
AssaultWithEmbraces: she says "me?" like she had a cold
RainbowAsh: I agree that she would have problems fitting in with a lesser flight team, however I imagine after what happened she wouldnt be able to join the wonderbolts, putting 5 ponies at risk and 4 possible pony deaths is kinda serious.
MadSurge: Ohhhh
DerpyMuffins: no, but that pony looked a bit like her :D
Anyone here good at finding pics?
<3 this song
so many mosh pits were had to this song
Yay, Prodigy! :$
Pendulum
?
pendulum remix of Voodoo people
/me moshs
/me dodges Chrysalis
The original is pretty good too
Oh my are those eyes pretty!
Rommulus, on the other hand, RD helped her with everything she did, and she got out fine. Even if she was the one who notified Spitfire, that shouldn't cleanse her record completely, especially when it comes to offenses you get thrown out for.
/me </mosh>
GilDash, we have seen cutie marks with non-obvious interpretations, but I don't think we never saw a pony who had to ponder what their mark's true meaning was.
/me bobs head
RainbowAsh: I'd assume they would know the moment they had it. It's a moment of awakening for each and every pony.
RainbowAsh: That is true in the regard that RD did get off scot free however RD was against it, saved their lives and did the right thing by telling Spitfire what was going on. She should of got some sort of punishment however did not, whether it be favouritism or just their view on the situation.
http://i.imgur.com/fE22e.gif WHERE ARE MY COMICS AND/OR MY SECRET SANTA GIFT çD
:D
Is that a meme already?
Rommulus, exactly. That's why I think that Lightning Dust also wasn't thrown out. It just wouldn't be fair at all.
oh god, MadSurge's gone Pinkie. Run for the hills!
DerpyMuffins: only for me

/me comes floating with baloons tied to arround her "Run for your liiiiiiiiiiiives!"
/me noms cheeseburger for breakfast
baloons.

All right, I must take off. Take care everypony!
You know what I mean, Jmo.
arround.
:P
RainbowAsh: Exactly, it wasnt fair however I believe she was thrown out due to the torn uniform and not even recieving the badge.
AssaultWithEmbraces: join me, there's an amazing world beyond the fourth wall!
CHESS
Bye E_J|Homework
GilDash, I think so, too. That's why you could later on come to be discontend with what your mark turns out to be.
CHECKERS
IT IS FRIGGING CHESS
<3<3<3<3<3<3
One NIght in Bangkok! <z3

why not select the black and invert?

MadSurge: Really? Do they have cotton candy?
yes
wait
Wrek: <3 THANK YOU FOR PLAYING THIS REMIX
no
AssaultWithEmbraces: yesh :3
<3 I love Chess SOOOOOO muuuuuch!
/me grabs MadSurge and destroys the fourth wall in search of cotton candy
RainbowAsh: Maybe, but it supposed to be something you love so much you'd never give it up.
Rommulus, I am not that familiar with military customs. Is ripping the uniform of a cadet to throw him out really a thing?
NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP
NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN
something something something blah blah ROICK ASTLEY
GilDash, unless the cutie mark magic can look into the future, how could be sure?
RainbowAsh: It's magic.
/me gets some satisfaction
What if... a cutie changes?
What if... a cutie mark changes?
Theres a fic for that
THERES A FIC FOR EVERYTHING
Oh no, Microsoft Sam is grooving out! :D
this song is so badass
the music video is awesome

next year next gen consoles come out
maby
lame
but most likely
unlikely
maybe 3/4 quater
but not for summer
< I wouldn't mind seeing that in the office every morning.
I remember when a single game console lasted for several years before they came out withanew one
Time to order some PIZZA
fun fact my laptop is still more powerfull than the next gen xbox
Haku1013 this current generation has been the longest ever
Chrysalis shut up
This generation's been going for 5 years.
its old, outdated
2007-2012.
we need new hardware
SHUT UP I WIN
Not ending it in 2013 would be utter stupidity.
055?
also, the games are showing the age of the hardware
05more liek 8
Really? 8?
05aye
they should of ended it years ago
Fuck...
05crysis 1 still looks better than the newest one
05why?
05consoles
I think we can all agree I won this argument
Wrek its a sad fact
Oh, aye. It pisses me off PC's neglected for consoles these days.
They didnt even release crysis2 on dx11
until they got ALOT of hatemail for it
Wrek: crysis 1 was made for pc in mind. crysis 2 was made for consoles in mind
There should be an online TRansformers game
naturesfury actually neither
05yeah i already stated that naturesfury
crysis was made to show off their new engine
RainbowAsh: I believe the torn uniform is being used as symbolism to reffer to LD as being removed from the group, as she was not given a badge and was also not shown in the final shot with all the ponies in the air flying and thus leads to my opinion of LD being thrown out.
/me dances
theyre new engine for 2 was heavily console optimised built for the current generation
the old engine was them building for the generations after
wub wub wub
Gaah this song reminds me that I'll probably never get to see deadmau5
nyeh
05this is as close techno gets to dubstep withotu eing dupstep
Rommulus, yeah, but she got lead away, so she couldn't be in the final shot. Maybe she got chewed out and came back later with new uniform and silver badge.
05the bass threw that b upside down
Wrek you ever listen to hardcore at all?
05probably not
Lel Ghosts 'n' Stuff
fair enough
I should REALLY watch the new episode
bass speaker is happy
/me glomps Jmo
/me huggles AssaultWithEmbraces
/me sneaks into the love ball
<-- With an expression like that, you've got to wonder what she's called you in for.
hello everypony
RainbowAsh: Rash and irresponsible decisions in any institute that could lead to deaths, especially 4 - 5 would cause someone to be thrown out of that institute. If someone was to endanger 4 - 5 peoples lives in cadets I am damn sure they wouldnt be there afterward.
http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/381980_10151566915984966_887727501_n.jpg
repeating my earlier point, she didnt care that she did it either
Hi texasboykc09 :)
she showed absolutely no remorse for nearly killing 4 ponies
05brb grabbin' dinner
Shit... ive forgotten to feed my neo pet for the last 10 years
Lyra` know that feel bro
Lyra' Dude... its dead
Neo pet... why does that sound familiar?
you dont know that!
Pfft, Neopets.
Tamagotchi or gtfo.
Lyra' Its gone, let it go
Its alright Lyra` you can get a new one.
Jmo: Tamagochi was the shit.
Rommulus, Spitfire was generally ok with the tornado, though. And LD couldn't possibly know that a balloon would suddenly appear in the training area.
THEY SHOULD REBOOT NEOPETS
didn't viacom buy neopets for their nick brand?
Oath it was.
Haku1013 Hah. I know right. But that is a funny way to say that it should never come around again.
Theres nothing wrong with reboots
RainbowAsh: However she may not know that the balloon would appear there were still other students thats lives were endangered by the tornado.
Didn't think Wrek listened to music like this.
Surprised.
The music is too.
Jmo: Though my tamgochi always died over night.
RIP
They offer a new way to look at something old, for a newer generation. Sometimes, it's tuhe reboots that are better.

Wrek is doing a good job at drawing spitfire
I still say unicorns are better
Lyra' Um... I don't think there are any other kind.
earth pony is best pony
/me doesnt like bacon either
Other kind of what?
Haku1013: Heresy!
Other kind of Burger Kings
Australia has Hungry Jacks AKA Burger King.
/me could go for some Whataburger
Only a few remain with the old name in NSW, but is mainly called Hungry Jacks.
There may be a single BK spot in the UK
I want some Five Guys
I supposed that counts. They should of named it Austrailian Burger King.
There's plenty of BK sports in the UK. I had one only the other day.
Do they have The Outback Steackhouse in Australia?
Steack?
How to engrish.
Steak
Haku1013: :|
RainbowAsh: Yet it is still irresponsible, all it takes is 2 of the ponies to collide in a tornado that LD and RD couldnt control and they would plummet to the ground.
Oh Jmo, your such a gnazi.
Yeah they do.
Do they have The Outback Steakhouse in Australia, or is it just called food over there?
They have 6 of them open, 7th to come.
Speaking fo which
Malavolent, you're*
i lovemost of you

duh
which induces muscle spasms
hola everypony
WE INVENTED THE HOT DOG
theyre all stolen, made with cheaper materials and sold on
except twinkies
and youlet them die
Twinkies are dead now
Rommulus, irresponsible and reckless? Yes. But I don't think that is grounds for a permanent exclusion. Those recruits are still young, and LD might well have learned her lesson.
Twinkies kill
So Wreks is doing art, and that looks like... Spitfire
now how will zombie land come to pass
Jmo: Come on, their's no need to do that.
mitamakng: hello
actually....
/me likes the cupcakes better than twinkies
Malavolent, oh you.
is that how zombie land came to pass
You make me chuckle.
its so hard to find a twinkie because theyre are none left
LD was a hothead who never realized she did anything wrong, she wouldn't have learned a lesson even if she had just been punished
Jmo: You wouldn't think I don't grammar, right?
A man once sold a twinkie on Ebay for 300000 dollars
Anyway it was just a fantasy camp.... I think
You're ever so silly Malavolent.
what up
Lol, I still have a box of Twinkies from 2005
There's that one company that's thinking about buying twinkies from Hostess
Haku1013: wut?
Yeah
Haku1013: smart man, fool the buyer
Haku1013 yeah a mexican company
TWINKIES ARE NOW MEXICAN FOOD
Mexican Twinkies?
:D
well, and MLP
/me is now prouder to be of mexican/hispanic descent
Haku1013: /)
RainbowAsh: Again, RD seemed to have a bit of favouritism and not even get a slap on the wrist and LD did get a severe punishment but it was within good judgement, LD caused RD to clip her wing which does not show good leadership when flying and showed no remorse for doing so, she showed shhe could not work in a team or be pacient when she and RD knocked all other flyers away and endangered many lives with the tornado. This showed she was able to b

Chrysalis: yeah, because english candy is so horrible right? I mean what
MEXICO
Australian here
05i didnt try brittish candy
Wrek: You've been drawing for quite a few hours today, haven't you?
05but what i can say is that the food sucks
Wrek: Depends on where you go.
horrible? seriously brittish sweets are so much better
0590% of everythign is concentrate with essense of various fruits
I might get sent out for 6 months next year to Stockholm :)
Huh, forgot you were Australian as well Rommulus.
I am offended by that Wrek
dat spitfire o.o
Rommulus is it true that everything is trying to kill you over there?
05but to fix that
Not sugar.... the horror
seriously how you guys ruin chocolate so badly i have no idea
Of course, I prefer Italian cuisine over British food anyway. XD
05IRN'BRU and a superb asian citchen
05kitchen*
Haku1013: >.> <.< Fear the drop bears....
oh yeah, i generally prefer indian to english
05srsly the take out asian food was fantastic
05specialyl the thai
I LIKE FOOD
Asians know how to cook
GilDash: smart man :3
no one in brittain ever actually eats brittish food
FOOD IS AWESOME
Rommulus, the last part of your message was cut off. Still, it was her first offense. If she was made wingpony and managed to stay in line with her leader, she could still become a valuable asset.
we just have it for the tourists
MadSurge: I quite like Indian curries as well. ^_^
i
GilDash: I never tried curry :O
Chrysalis: They don't eat fish and chips errday?
Actaully I don't know why I was trying to defend British food at all. I'm not a big fan myself. XD
Malavolent god no
But the books say they do!
You know the most popular food in brittain
is an indian curry
RainbowAsh: Thats as if saying attempted murder (long stretch there) should be a slap on the wrist offense.
Chrysalis: That's because it's awesome.
08,01hmm
I always wanted try spicy curry, like from that one naruto episode
GilDash i know right
08,01i'm thinking of being a bastard
although apparently the brittish versions are nothing compared to the indian
08,01my dad has made this loom program in VB
Chrysalis: How about irish cooking?
08,01and he's designed some hardware to go with it
really want to go to india for a big strong curry
08,01it's taken him months to design it and put it together
he deserves everything bad that happens
08,01i'm considering reversing his hardware and coding up my own software in python
08,01and then releasing it open source
do it in lua
Rommulus, the difference between LD's offenses and something like murder, is that the latter is done out of malice. LD was reckless, but she didn't want to hurt anyone.
08,01(he wants to distribute his as closed source shareware)
LD did not learn her lesson, that was the problem
nyeh
nothing wrong with shareware
08,01RainbowAsh: yeah, kinda; but i'm not convinced there's a market for it
mitamakng, she did look quite shocked in the end.
08,01i'd just be doing it for the fun of reversing it
05check stream
That was over getting kicked out
08,01so i'll probably not be a bastard
Not over what happened
RainbowAsh: She may of not wanted to hurt anyone but she also did not show any form of care for hurting after she had done so to RD and almost done so to all the others. I think she was expelled however I believe she would be allowed to return once she has proven that she is no longer as reckless as she once was.
08,01texasboykc09: unfortunately not; he's not released it for distribution yet
nice picture
08,01and i don't have it installed currently
Rommulus, expelled, but be allowed to try again next year? Yeah, I could see that.
I just want LD to be a RD rival
RainbowAsh: So we agree on this? Hooray long winded debate over XD
Heya alexxm, how have you been?
I miss Trixie being a rival, we need a new one
08,01Wrek: oh wow
i'm good Malavolent you
alexxm: Well I'm kinda tired, but it's okay.
05also
05love this song
I wonder if they will bring back Gilda at some point in time.
05punkadelica
i hope not
mitamakng, I don't think Trixie's trixing days are over yet. But yeah, I would love to see LD as RD's rival. I think she would be better as a rival inside the Wonderbolts instead of independent from them.
i hate ldd so much
ld*
Here is how I see it, LD will blame RD for losing her shot, the rivalry writes itself after that
GOTTA GO BYE
I couldnt help but to think mybe Derpy will appear in the beginning when they were waiting for the mail pony...
Gary Oak of MLP has been found it seems.
they will never bring back derpy
to much contravusy
flutterfan99: it seems so
flutterfan99, give them time.
Okay the Ustream ads are a bit much
I agree Alchemist, I was really hoping derpy would be there.
05i saw these guys live almost a year ago now
05it was awesome
I know this song by heart
oh wrek
Fallout :3
this music
i meen ofcorse i want them to
chat derped
<3 This song <3
i should play fallout
Fallout music
mitamakng, if LD remains in the Wonderbolts, she is still set back and no longer a leader. I think that would suffice for rivalry without making her a bitter character.
the offical theme song to any nuclear wasteland
Why not bring in the Shadowbolts?
Agreed RainbowAsh
I would bet there is a fic of LDxRD
Wrek: what software are you using?
As in the Year set back thing.
im back, awesome, the ink spots
looks like Sai
Imagine if LD finds the jealousy that possesed Luna
texasboykc09 SAI
Then thats some bad news bears going on mitamakng
What exactly is the role of the wonderbolts besides doing some parades?
Fallout new Vegas > Fallout 3
mitamakng, what would her villain name be then?
micheal jackson made sonic 3's music
They seem to be military like.
Lightning Dash?
Alchemist: I imagine the same role the Blue Angels play in the U.S. Air Force.
/me parachutes into the chat
hiya
Rainbow Lightning
Alchemist, I think the shows are the main stay, but they also fight dragons apparently.
Alchemist: I see the Wonderbolts as protectors of Equestria, as they were sent in when Spike had grown due to greed.
yeah
damnit wrek!
Oh my god... good music..........
Am I the only one who sees the Blue Angels connection?
Gold_Demona: They were based on the Blue Angles, so no...
The Wonderbolts are the Blue Angels, they are a publicity for the Equestrian Air Force
That's waht I thought
what*
RainbowAsh: maybe we just see them during shows because... there arent that many wars going on in equestria :D
Alchemist: fair
Gold_Demona, I think there was even word of god that the Wonderbolts were inspired by the Blue Angels.
2 bad they were nowhere to be seen when spike did actually grow or during the dragonshy episode
I also couldnt help to notice how they avoided RD to say that her friends nearly got killed :D
Alchemist, when RD talks about the Wonderbolts, she is always talking about the shows, not about defending, though.
They also seem to a sports team, they race other teams and such
Cuz the Blue Angels are a legit military force, but they're also known for their air shows.
Alchemist, "smashed to pieces" was a rather obvious way to paraphrase that, though.
I second the notion of the Blue Angels.
The Blue Angels are the best pilots in the Air Force
In the dragonshy episode, the dragon wasn't out on a rampage. It was just sleeping in the wrong place
Blue Angels = Navy
I can see wanting to be part of the best fliers in Equestria
gah
wrek
all this music
you're thinking of the Thunderbirds which are Air Force
and its feeeels
RainbowAsh: and I think "demolished" was the other word she used. Its just funny, those are not the words that would spring to one's mind.
Oh yeah! That's right. Blue Angels are navy!
They're the navy's fighter pilots
As a Navy brat
didnt the woderbolts fail to stop spike when he went all big and greedy
wonderbolts*
As a Navy brat I love the Blue Angels, take that Thunderbirds
Funny thing about the Blue Angles doing air shows, that must be a left over from earlier times where inlisted men can customize their equipment. Lets see an airforce piolet todat paint a big boobed lady on his plane.
Alchemist, maybe they got a code what they can't say in the show.
i do a smashing rendition of blue moon
Whats on?
it involves blue body paint, a cane, and a tie, just a black tie
oh shi-
Frank Sinatra is pure good.
that looks really good
>best flyers in equestria
>fails to stop spike
Wrek: idea: add a big pint of cider to make her look RAF?
RainbowAsh: they CANT say killed in a kid's show. My poit is that in this episode it was comedically obvious.

The ponies were almost killed by a Hydra in season 1.

Rex_Mundi, it just wanted to play.
Actually the 80s were 3 decades ago. :P

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Uncertainty / Remembrance / Dust to Dust
Rex_Mundi: I agree. And with the equestrian army actually holding their own and not just being a backdrop.
Equestria has an army? all ive seen was the princesses guards
WUBS
thelonepony: Full Metal Jacket reference
Rex_Mundi: I assumed since they have guards, they also have an army.
^
To keep the Zebras and Saddle arabians out I assume.

Oh wow it is 4:03am XD I am ment to wake up in 4 hours.
:o
Night all! Cant wait to see the finished product on DA Wrek
I think we have all come to an acceptance that ponies are really rascist
They are the Spartans of Equestria
no?$
Night Rommulus
Rommulus: night
Night Rommulus :)
nai Rommulus
bai*
Alchemist, there are already Cows and donkeys in equestria, they need to stop imergration or Equestria will be full of... Lamas and stuff.:'(
bye Rommulus
Llamas has two Ls I think
Rex_Mundi, the ponies migrated to Equestria themselves.
Rex_Mundi: all them foreigners are taking the ponies jobs! Lets round them up in ghettos I say!
RainbowAsh: ah so the Buffalos where there first
Bah, If the Buffalo really wanted that land they would have planted apple trees themselvs.
thelonepony, probably.
test
oka
y
Rex_Mundi: I am not that familar with that episode, but didn't the buffalo go first
I love your music taste Wrek
mitamakng: they did
Huh, this joke has gotten so manifest destinyish and somewhat Nazi-esc.
http://i.imgur.com/usEWl.gif
So the evil pony settler came and tried to take their land, probably for beads or something
the buffalo was there first. then the settler took that land form them.
In seriousness though, the land that became Equestria seemed uninhabited to me, the Buffalo lived south of that and only recentkly have the two had problems, otr so it seems.
/me returns to the chat
Littlest pet shop is good this week
Rex_Mundi: by how that ep. started thee had problems for a while.
*they
Rex_Mundi, since the ponies had at least Roman age tech back then, the days when there was a thing like unclaimed land were long gone.
I remember seeing some where that the land of Equestria is actually made to look like Pony Island or something like that.
It also went on to say that Equestria is a really small part of the overall world.
Barbetos, from the official map, it looks roughly like NA
RainbowAsh, the ponies had lived someplace before they came to Equestria, maybe up north. But just because they had roman tech doesnt meen anything in a fantasticle fictional History.
Rex_Mundi, of course, anything goes in fantastic realms, but unless it is canonized I'm going with common sense. And that tells me that sentient life must have been around for many centuries and in that time all available land will have been claimed.
I also wonder how many tribes of ponies exsisted, were there other clans besides the 3 that initially made equestria, maybe there were earth pony tribes and such that never joined equestria.
Rex_Mundi, you mean like the Chrystal Ponies?
RainbowAsh: yeah, that proves there are pony realms outside of Equestria.
05...
Rex_Mundi, or at least used to be. After all, the Crystal Empire was in hiatus for a thousand years.
And maybe the heartwarming's eve story isn't entirely true. That usually goes with these old stories
Perhaps hostile wild pony tribes would be interesting
Rex_Mundi, definitely. Also, don't forget about the other sentient creatures that are around. I especially hope to see the Griffon empire one day.

Lil_B: dude is dedicated to the pony arts
so much detail
If Wrek had a cutie mark, it would be an eye with all the detail he puts in it.
in the end that hard work wont be so apperant, since its so small
But the picture would be poor
I would like to see dragons in this show that arnt jerks, other than spike.
*poorly made
Maybe a female Dragon should be introduced?
Rex_Mundi: have an adult dragon explain dragons' society! :D ^and that too
a female dragon? let all the shipfics begin
maybe a female dragon that shows interest in spike but spike rejects her
maybe characters from On a Cross and Arrow?
or humans?
Only Megan should be allowed to ever show up
My guess is that there many species of Dragons, there are ones that migrate, ones that sleep for 1000 years, etc.
Bacon and Applejack.
It's bacon and applejack!
Either Spike gets Rarity or he gets a female Dragon in the end, no?
05gona finnish anneli's request tomorrow probably
Males migrate and stay out all night, females actually do shit and build cities :D
A female Dragon would allow spike to get shipped with someone other than a pony.
05then gona start on libmans
05but for now
05i need a break from drawing
05hope ya like watchin!
well im gonna go
Thanks for stream Wrek, awesome as always :P
I would not like Spike X Rarity to become canon
Wrek: watching? I LOVE WATCHING! 8D
Thanks for the stream, Wrek

slenderman is coming to town
XD
sonicandmario85: why does yours show less mods
The only reason anyone talks about it is becuase it was streamed or put on youtube by "insert famous youtuber here"

The justin.tv stream does'nt work with it barbetos
Atleast for me
Oh.

It works, when I'm not signed in and when I'm in incognito mode, because that makes sense
Yeah. Same here
Im using incognito
I just went to the actuall justin acount.
you can sign in into chrome?
Yeah i can sign into anything on incognito, it just does'nt save any data/history

Shame I don't have an ipad though. This looks fun.
DayZ not streamed at all yet?
_Dark_Moon_: the walking simulator?
Snowden: good one.. not if your a bandit
Snowden: more like a Survial
survival*
Get your hands on a team of freinds and a weapon and you'll be killing people ;)
Ive played DayZ. its walk for, like, goddamn 45 minutes, and either get shot or hackers
SuperBrony64: if this is The Room where's Tommy Wiseau
/me noms a slim jim
The aim of the game is survival. you don't go out and run around aimlessy.. head for a town or something
13NO
13Kipkat07_Scarf: YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG
13YOU MUST SNAP INTO IT

it took us a week just to FIND eachother
guys... my dad said he loved me o.O
locked chests with keys inside that open locked chests with keys inside: the game.
I have tried restarting my browser many times, and how to I get the CSS to load?
Snowden: Yeah it really sucks cause bandits and hackers OWN that game. I would usually lay low and get some weapons and gear before heading out
_Dark_Moon_: my friends recomended War z
Socks: it happened to me, refresh
Snowden: Im getting the DayZ standalone
coolio
Ughhh.. 2 tests in the morning
Dark92Enigma: What do you think I've been doing for the past few weeks, it's been like this for ages and won't fix :(
Good thing is school ends at 12:30am this whole week
Socks: Reinstall your browser?
Socks: OH. :O
That box is like puzzel-ception
GilDash: Will probably try that if nothing else works
Socks: What is the browser? i lost the picture link :)
http://s11.postimage.org/ov9i29x2r/Twitterz_is_derped.png
Soz for small size but I think you get the idea :P
Socks: That picture really is rediculously small. XD
I'll see if I can grab a better one
Socks: Emm.. try reinstalling chrome i suppose. if not i'll try find another solution
MadSurge: Why can't you just smash 'em with a hammer? XD
Socks: how old is your computer?
GilDash: that's a Gordian Knot approach! :D
MadSurge: Normal humans dont have the patience to make or solve such a thing
thelonepony: Not sure, only got it recently but it is second hand
It's a Windows XP so im guessing it's old

/me fininshed snapping into the 50 cm long slim jim and now needs some wayer
Is what the words tell me
*water
The release of your PC was in 2009
MadSurge: No, it's the "Get things done" approach. Or the Jeremy Clarkson approach. XD
God im gonna fail Gaeilge.. not lucking forward to 2morrow morning
Socks: It's probably a browser issue. Reinstall your browser.
Ok, reinstalling browser it is... Smoke me a Kipper, I'll be back for breakfast

Nice
Ace Rimmer
All my love for red dwarf :P

MadSurge: Yeah, but using a hammer/sword/whatever didn't do that to him. XD

11,02_Dark_Moon_: It's a puzzle
Man this game is tickling all kinds of fancies here. I wish it were on pc.
It's a crazy puzzle.

killerpony7733: That's what you get for playing SWtOR. :p
Buytoast: It's a room with a clock in it.
what do you do in it?
<--- What would it take to build one of these?
Looks like the top screws off?
Is the objective to like.. open the clock or something?
And it did! cool
GilDash Nope my laptop decides to crash or BSOD when it wants. Be it while doing simple things or playing games. So no that's not what i get for playing swtor
11,02You solve puzzles
k
GilDash, i guess mostly Nerves
Man with a game like this I don't even care about the objective. Solving the puzzles is it's own fun.
killerpony7733: I was just joking. XD But that sucks. Does it happen regularly, like every couple of hours or something?
/me noms a cookie and gives one to SuperBrony64
Invi: I don't think I could build a puzzle piece out of nerves. :D
o u :D
hey SuperBrony64 wanna cookie?
GilDash Nah it doesn't comes about maybe once a week or so? not bad really. But yeah it does unexpected stuff at times.
/me noms a cookie and gives another to SuperBrony64
11,02:D
/me noms on the cookie :3c
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: i liek cookies :3c
/me gives cookie to SuperBrony64
i know you like them :P
killerpony7733: I had an old PC that used to BSoD every couple of hours or so. Never figured out what was wrong with it, but at least I could time when it would fuck up. XD
My old PC used to shut off by itself
Urgh! Having to use IE to download chrome does not get more pleasant with time.
It's 3/7 SuperBrony64
uuuuugh!!!!! sooocks
There has to be a clue as to the correct date to set the time to.
And it didn't work :(
GilDash Oh well
Socks: Your using IE? nightmare
Speaking of which, hiding a secret in a clock by usiing the hands seems rather impractical, since once a day you'd have your secret compartment fly open on it's own.
Chrome is reinstalled and my twitters still no working :(
anyone here got lego LOTR?
Socks: There might be a problem with your drivers or something. Alternatively, it could just be Twitter.
/me weaps into his pillow
Nyst, but it only works with the glowy stone he put into the clcok
*clock
Thanks for the help guys, guess I am doomed to forever be without twitter, ah well, not a great loss :P
did this only start happening recently?
i hardly ever use my tiwtter
I was speaking in general secret clocks, but good point. Glowing gems solve everything.
_Dark_Moon_: No been happening for a while :(
/me sobs cause her tummy hurts
Socks: give a day or two
/me rubs aniderp|bestcakeever's tummy
Socks: Woah that's strange.. maybe Gildash is right.. problem with drivers? :P
6:05 is probably it
/me pretends he knows what that means
13drivers do not cause browser rendering issues
cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer
How do I fix the drivers
13he's not receiving CSS
Fianlly
13drivers have nothing to do with it at all
Finally
Oh right.
Shizuka: What does that actually mean?
So df is wrong with CSS?
Wait what...how did all those things fit inside the box if it was hollow?
13i don't know
Cascading Style Sheets
I don't even know what that means lmfao
Shizuka: Fair enough. XD
13all he's posted is a miniscule screenshot
Nyst, satanic ritual

/me should be studying but is on bronystate instead :P

Nittany_Discord: But the world is ending in a few days, whats it matter? Hurr Hurr Hurr!!
By the way......by ''stick it to ___'' one means ''stick'' as in ''stay together'' or ''hit''?
We wish.
Hi gurrrrrls
Invi: Well, thank your pal for me as well. :)
Sooo many of my friends in Florida are relying on the world ending :D
:D
When is "the world ending" anyway? Is it the 21st?
"Screw tests, world is ending"

Hey sonicdude558!

Hi sonicdude558

Hi sonicdude558
Due to calenders not having leap years in mayan times the world was supposed to have ended... yu know the rest ¬_¬
Chrysalis: Also, your attitude disgusts me. Sorry.
I just think they don't want to finish the calender lol.. "Nah im bored"
A year ago if you don't :P
Ponyplushies is having a $10 discount on their Twi plushie... Its $75 now

Chrysalis: Someting must be gnawing at him. I've not seen Nittany like that. :S
75$ for twi plushy? :O

RaveBrony: the slideshow fucked up apparently and needs to be fixed
who in their right mind would pay 75 smackers for a stuffed toy?
I would Like a Rarity plushie....but Good ones are so hard to come by....

WOAH
DerpyMuffins: Van Canto - Last Night of the Kings
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Invictus
w was watching it this morning.. now it's just woahhh ..
Sung this for my School musical audition :P
00,10now to see what was all the pings
Didn't get any part :(
Sumica: We were talking about your OC
i muted the steam but i can still hear the music 0_)
Anger: You can't have muted it properly then. :p
Wrek is still drawing?
00,10so I see
RustyMeat: He just started drawing
Wish I was as good as Wrek
oh
Ok, I better go, this work aint gonna do itself. Bye everypony :)
RustyMeat: Or at least just started the stream with this drawing
Bye Socks
Socks: See ya! :)
/me rides out on a ridleyiddley
Cya Socks
ahh van canto
these guys are so coo
00,10thought I was doing rather well seeing as it was my first time useingthe Bolt rifle and I already got Bronze
actually bought their albums last night
Sumica: what game?
00,10Planetside 2
oh
00,10I kept snipeing medics
I swore I saw "Bolt Action Rifle" not just Bolt Rifle
oh God this
00,10well it's both
ah
damn if only my PC could run it
DAMMIT
00,10a bolt action bolt driver
I can't wait to get my new gaming PC
00,10not sure why a what is basicly a railgun needs a bolt
Is her nose the only thing holding the shades up?
00,10just like on the ep DerpyMuffins
Heh. I downloaded PS2 but haven't even touched it yet really
DerpyMuffins: You can get glasses like that in real life as well.
Pony physics
Sumica: I thought she folded her glasses when RD came in to see her?
00,10she did
00,10she has ear bits on them
00,10but if you look at it they sit below the ears
Sumica: ... That's a bad design. XD
00,10twas how they did it on the show
What rank is Spitfire exactly?
DerpyMuffins general?
00,10no point of reffrence to tell
No, I just meant from a general design point. Why have handles if they don't rest against anything? It's just added mass.
She looks like a commander
whos drawing this ;o
DerpyMuffins: we don't know how rankings work in Equestria but she's obviously top dog of the Wonder Bolts
Wrek
00,10Wrek is
DerpyMuffins: She's rank BADASS.
Suzano: Wrek
Suzano: Wrek is
ok.... imoficialyblown away
Wrek is best artist :3
Yeah, Wrek has that affect.
00,10it's rather amazing how far he has come in a year
Suzano: Wrek has been doing this stuff for over a year now here, and he's IMPROVED since I got here if you can believe it
I can't draw for squat XD
^
at least on PC, I suck with a mouse
im drawing since 6....
It's quite inspiring really. Even I've got the urge to try drawing at some point.
and im not even close
But yet over 30 people stalk me on DA <.<
Ponies47: they're coming for you....
I use a tablet to draq
draw*
Chess <3
I can draw. I just need a compass, ruler, and pencil
_Dark_Moon_: Wrek USED to use a mouse all the time until he got his tablet
How is the drawing going Ponies47
but theyre only just comics
I have SAI but I need a tablet. ;A;
otakon: The tablets are very useful. Helps reduce mistakes
yeah
I use them for my art exams and stuff
DerpyMuffins: I rage quited on it. Couldn't get it right ;_;
lawl alienware
CrystalPhoenix: World peace
DerpyMuffins, do you have family?
Half a country away yea

Wrek: What program is that your using?

Chrysalis: It will be. I've got a lot saved up for it.
Yay :D
/me puts Socks on his hooves and plays with his scarf
Socks see my excuse it i have to wait for one of my 2 spare phones to charge enough to actually see which ones work
Socks: Thats a point, I have exam prep to do, damn bronystate XD
I think I've watched people play Just Dance a little too much.
/me has not got a scarf :O

Scoot-Scootaloo: :P
/me Thanks Kipkat07_Scarf and noms on his KFC
Hi Scoot-Scootaloo :)
rdibp
the hell is that? O.o
It's football in Europe. Fusbal in spain. and Soccer in USA
I don't play footbal
I do, im a goalkeeper and right back :)
It's football everywhere, you all say it wrong
Socks: ikr
/me gets Ponies47 an ipad
I call it football
Futbol is best ball
WHo invented the game? I think you'll find we did therefore you call it what we call it :[
Broke my thumb goalkeeping once.. damn was it painful!
_Dark_Moon_: Ouch
I never play sports. :p
Im a amazing goalkeeper when im onform though
/me broke his leg playing football once, and has never done any kind of sport since
Wrek still has that wing to do
Socks: If you look back far enough, it was probably invented by the Chinese or even before that. England just made the modern game popular.
Socks: Not wearing shinguards? :)
GilDash: Shush you ¬_¬
Try Tennis
_Dark_Moon_: Nope I was around 7 :D
You really don't run that much
I suck at all sports! :D
Tennis can be fun, It's the only sport I'll play with my dad
I got tennis going for me
Pelotas para jugar con tus manos? Me gusta~
I wear gk leggings, kit shirt, Rival Pred gloves, and Predator X boots.
I prefer squash to tennis.
Though I'm better at tennis than squash. XD
My history teacher is a huge football fan so he and my other classmates spend half out lessons shouting at each other about whose team is best :D
*our
Socks: That's sounds like a typical history lesson. So much crap that you waste most of it. XD
here are my gloves:

I saved 5k on college by playing tennis
120 euros double padding fingersave ultimate ii
I have had epic history teachers, my GCSE History teacher got bored of teaching us one day so we all put the tables on their sides and played castles :D
Socks: Lucky.. my school is super strict.
I think my history teacher beat me once
Socks: Are you in Highschool?
They're still allowed to do that!
Socks: That sounds like a pretty crap teacher, actually. A fun guy, a crap teacher. XD
^
^^
thelonepony: I'm in Sixth form now, that teacher was in GCSE
^^^
05wait!
Socks: ah, i see
Sixth form?
05i know a prefect song for this
oh yeah
GilDash: He was acctually an excellent teacher, I learnt more from him than any other teacher in my school. That was just one day when he could not give a shit. And he wasn't as bad as my headmaster whom I consistantly had shouting matches with.
/me is pissed.
My school was many things, strict was not one of them
What's wrong Kipkat07_Scarf
Lucky you, I had a nun for one of my teachers
_Dark_Moon_: his phone got stolen I think
If my phone got stolen i'd hunt them down and take people in for questioning :L
I went to private school from kindergarden to 8th grade. Worst fucking years of my life -_-
Wrek: Danger Zone Top Gun OST? :P
My teachers were the best thing about my school though, I went through three years of near silence because no one would talk to me :(
I just love my GK gloves.. can't be without them :)
My aunt comes over and then she says she has to cut my sideburns. I however want to grow them out and she says they look unruly and I dissagree. She then says that I look quote "gay" with my sideburns like that.
Socks: I know dat feel :s
she then cuts them fucking short
Socks: same here
I managed to get one friend, but she was friends with the people who wouldn't talk to me so... yeah... sad times :(
Top Gun music for Top Gun episode
05brb
Ugh i feel like the odd one out :|
I dont want to look like a jock asshole. I just want look how i wanted to look
_Dark_Moon_: Y?
Dat Spitfire
/me huggles thelonepony and Ponies47 "I know dem feels"
I've only had one real friend in my life and then he betrayed me -_-
I know everyone and are freinds with everyone in my area :\
Still trying to figure out what she's thinking...
i had one friend through Kindergarten to 3rd grade and then I moved across the fuckin country where I had one friend there too
I play alot of sports and i get to go to alot of places around IRL/UK
Talk about fast http://ponybot.net/?i=6383
I managed to make it through my early life with around 5 friends, I have lost them all pretty much :(
05back
You guys will prob see me on TV on Sky Sports playing football soon :3
Cuz im playing in front of Liverpool and stuff over in England in Spring
Socks: but i was able to make friends earlier, i moved when i was in 4th grade, came back in the middle of 7th
_Dark_Moon_: Be sure to let us know when you're on, What team you in?
DerpyMuffins: JJ cheated because he saw the episode on youtube earlier this week :P
/me hugs Socks "I have no friends right now. Like I've said. I've only had one true friend and then he betrayed me"
Im playing in front of Liverpool, Wigan, Stokes, United and Everton
So i hope i sorta make the big breakthrough
/me hugs Ponies47 back
Ponies47: the one that came up with that name for you?
/me does not know what playing in front of means
Scoot-Scootaloo: my aunt is a bitch :<
/me kidnaps Socks
X-MEN!
Sucks man :/
woo best them music ever
Kipkat07_Scarf: tell her "dont like how i look like? go suck a chood"
Socks: It's like.. trialing. you play in front of them in football and if you do good, they'll contact you and ask for your signature
thelonepony: My OC's name? No I'm talking about IRL people.
Ponies47: ah
I'll be earning 15,000 a friggin week to prob sit on my ass and watch a match!!
_Dark_Moon_: Oh ok, Well good luck, I hope you get in :)
_Dark_Moon_: You lucky sod
Say im injured and i can't play
Sit back and relax and get payed
I have been very lucky with friends as it is, but I've lost enough to appreciate it when I have them.
Ahh NItty isn't here
thelonepony: she works at a prison and her husband is an ex-cop asshole
I know TOO many people.. i can't keep up with them
thelonepony: i enjoy being alive thank you
Kipkat07_Scarf: wait, wut?
I had the perfect Spitfire pic for him
Being alone with no friends IRL sucks ._.
Kipkat07_Scarf: ah, well sorry :<
My phone has over 450 contacts -_-
too many teeeexts.. my phone is being raped D:
oh yeah pokemon
Oh snap!
POKEMON
Is that Pokemon?
Sometimes i like to just sit back and talk to awesome peeps on the internetz
you teach me and ill teach you!
Must resist...singing... I'll look weird...er
It's sort of the reason I connect with fluttershy, she's not good with people and any friends she has have fallen into her lap out of sheer luck, if she loses them then she aint getting any more :(
Ponies47: remember what most of us told you, Join a Club, do some sports if you want, Get in the tech group whatever you do. You will find people to talk to
I can relate to Rainbow Dash cause im pretty sporty :D
my headphones only play sound in one ear :'(
Hell, Join the Acting club to Show them your acting~
Kipkat07_Scarf: that sucks, what brand?
thelonepony: Yeah. I looked into that. All the clubs they have I was not interested in. I suck at sports so that's outta the question. :I
Ponies47: Go to places, find clubs, I found a filming club, the majority of people I would call friends now, I found at that club
I gotta give a shoutout to bronystate on Sky Sports lmao :3
thelonepony: MY BRAND
Phase4: Dat awake Australien
Ponies47: what do you like to do?
/me slaps thelonepony around a bit with a large cow
thelonepony: Sit at my computer all day and that's it really.
Guys play football and even if you don't know the people you'll make freinds with them over time!
/me slaps twilight_sprinkle around a bit with a Large chancla
is this Powerglove?
_Dark_Moon_: Give a shoutout to me! :P
Socks: I will :)
Ponies47: Tech, debate? :P
Nope
/me will send Socks some of my 15,000 each week

Damn chat crashes -.-
Im not depressed.. for some reason i just want to grab my football gloves and dive around in the dark outside looking like a complete tool
And how may i ask him?
/me goes to listen to 1 pound fish song again
I'm sorry. What did you say before thelonepony? My chat crashed agian ;_;
Ponies47: Tech, debate? :P
thats what i said
you said no
Wrek: that looks so awesome right now
For you people who "dissed" Lightning Dust
And then the chat crashed and I just heard a ping when it happened
_Dark_Moon_: ikr
He'll do that to you ;_;
I didn't diss lightning dust :'(
Everytime someone draws something amazing, your art looks like stick figures compared to their work...
jojoyasmin: haha ikr
Vordox: She has to learn somehow.
GilDash: Eeeyup
I also assume he is using a tablet
I see a really old HP monitor under the stairs and im thinking
"is that for my alienware?"
Vordox: I never dissed her, But arrogance caused her being kick out. I only wish she gets redemtion for what she done
GAH I know this song, but I can't name it!
thelonepony: She didn't get kicked out
Vordox: she got demoted
demoted, yes
Vordox: really? damn memory is shitty for me today -_-
i need the pills
brb
thelonepony: Agreed
joyjoyasmin, it sounds like a remix of an old batman movie song. but I am not sure
freaking epic song.. gets me pumped before matches :http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9ekXmri0lk
It is batman!
Vordox: It wasn't really clear, but it looked as though she was kicked out to me. Hell, she had guards escorting her.
GilDash: I doubt she was sacked on the spot.. i'd say demoted
GilDash: We'll never see
the_real_pony_1604: Once you said batman, I figured it out XD thanks
_Dark_Moon_: Considering what she did, possibly.
I missed the livestream so i watched a MASSIVE full screen 1080p youtube episode.. it was win
Vordox: wait, her name is Snowflake. I never knew :O
?*
thelonepony: No, Snowflake is the guy :P
Well, have to go. bye everypony :P

sonicandmario85: you cant be here it your 10

being young isn't an excuse for being annoying
sonicandmario85: there wasn't an age limit then.

13welp
You know, you COULD just lie about your age...
but not here though
Here comes the ShizuTrain
13scoot
toot tooooot
13you should not be encouraging users to break rules
can i please stay though? my mom knows im here
NUTIN'S BETTER THEN A PINKIE PIE PARTY
sonicandmario85: okay do you at least have your parents permission to be here?
yes
Shizuka: although he DOES have perental permission it seems
no...
05i smell lies
why does it matter we're not pedos
05oh rite
05sleep
sonicandmario85: don't lie
13parental permission lets you be on the netowkr
Wrek: yes sleep
Shizu, someday we need to watch death note. Someday...
13however we do not permit children under 14 to be here
i do have permission

13oh god death note... couldn't stand death note
meh, death note
that's that potato chip show right?
Shizu, why naaawt? D:
eeyup
death note is kinda boring..
Deathnote was MLG D:
besides i like this chat theres no other ones like it
/me writes everyones name in the book
13it just got ridiculous the longer it dragged on
death note was good
You will all die. >:3
theres a stream and everything
ScootaChicken's school is doing a Deathnote play
BlazeAngel: i have no life, you cant kill me
i agree wih that shizuka
13"AHA I KNEW YOU WERE KIRA BECAUSE I HAPPENED TO BROADCAST THIS ONLY IN THE EXACT NEIGHBORHOOD YOU LIVE IN"
^
13"AHA BUT I KNEW YOU WOULD DO THAT SO I KILLED SOMEONE YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT"
:P
and the brilliant kira fell for an obvious trap there
Ever consider streaming Card Captor Sakura?
stream real animes
I've never watched it, and Im a sucker for magical girl anime.
like inuyasha
13might have to pick up cardcaptors some time, don't remember hardly anything from it
or naruto
LadyCanary, I love you
But... Death note had good animation... *The excuse sounds stupid in this case, eh?*
shit
.... Buytoast pls go.
I want to watch Card Carptor Derpy
ok bye everypony
but naruto is the best
errrr Sakura I mean
BELIEVE IT
Bye texasboykc09.
see ya tex
bye texasboykc09
god it hurts to even type that
13sumicasan~
Everyone knows that Dragon Ball Z is the only acceptable anime
Oh my god I thought you were being serious Buytoast
naruto is good minux the fillers, but they put those in every ep, so its prety bad
there we go
LadyCanary, there's even this little mini-lion called Kero
pff dbz
I am aware of that.
Gosh now I want to watch that anime
13need to show akira some time
13KANEDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
05what should i watch as i fall asleep?
Anime in general is just like "LIFE AS WE KNOW IS ALL FUCK FOR NOTHING WE HAVE TO DO THINGS BY CERTAIN RULES TO DO STUFF"
WREKY!
/me hugs Wrek tightly
13reki? :P
13wreki?
dbz is best anime evar, it has the strongest characterz tht cud pwn all the characterz in ur favorit anime!!!1
shit i dont even watch enough anime to have tastes on what's good and what's bad
Reki = Reikem?
05:3
lel?
13i hope wreki does not contract the feels, haibane's about to start delivering by the truckload
what's the best place to download anime?
Not too sure.
Wrek can you draw some scenery sometime?
05mebbeh
...
/me gives Wreky a blanket and pillow.
I would rather have something more direct but ok
I've never seen Haibane, tho I've heard it's really good
did sonicandmario leave?
twilight_sprinkle: he did said what was his age
asume that he was kick/banned
aw
I doubt he was banned
BANNED
he wasn't banned
with a GIANT hammer
he was TERMINATED
thats why i have the / there
calm yer self
no yeah sonicandmariodude got banned
besides Shizuka, if you really want wrek to contract the feels, queue up either Air or the most recent Kanon
again
moving on
13oh just wait
what are those floors made of if the plate leaves a trail
BUT THEN HELL MAKE HIS EPIC RETURN IN FOUR YEARS
and will still be equally dumb
why
because who the hell learns anything at that stage of life anyway?
What is this the Credits for?
13twilight_sprinkle: wasn't a plate, it's a lid from a paint can
or the intro?
outro
for Haibane Renmei
I know I didn't learn anything intil at least 12
OH GOD
XD
dat plot
this...
huh
THIS...
Gods why?
Mikuru
oh look is ep 1
she's definitely the Fluttershy of the show
is that.... a playboy bunny!?
yes
yes it is
Its a bunny girl
Why am I reminded of playboy everytime I see this
tha happens to be busty as hell for a high shcooler
DerpyMuffins: playboy bunny outfit
um is it me or does the animation look rougher than usual?
otakon: not in this show genre
it felt as if millions of perverts cried out in joy and then silenced
is it jsut me or does this sound like incredibly cheap studio equipment?
^
dat....singing...
I think that's what they were going for
13it is
that's the idea with episode 0
XD
this from the R1 dvd?
large cabbages...
my cabbages!
the life of a cabbage salesmen is always a destructive one
MY LARGE CABBAGES!
>girl in bunny scostume advertises
>noone minds
right
it's Japan
seriously that's probably commonplace
it's after watching this for a few minutes that reminds me why I skip episode 0 in the first place
i dont understand the aguage and you can tell it was scripted
ah yes the BEST place to stuff an envelope
13CURSE YOU WAL MAAAAAAAAAAAART
bob bob bob
bouncy bouncy bouncy
XD
in anime japan perhaps, i dont think its common irl
otakon i doubt her suit have any pockets
Byon
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: good point
13oh and i'll be interjecting later in the episode :P
interjecting?
13you will see
an esper? I think theres therapy for that
what about time travel?
...Why is she wearing a Bunny Costume in the middle of the night?
she is from the future, of course, a combat waitress bunnygirl- from the future
because haruhi
DAMN YOU KYON!

Yukiyukiyukiyukiyuki

Goldframe: hello
/me blows Goldframe with a massive mouth beam
13mikuru beam didn't work?
13should have used ramiel beam

Nah, BlazeBeam
G beam!
scene change?

13rebuild obv

i'm still kinda confused as to what this anime is actually trying to tell me
lol
damn straight
BlazeAngel: naw, your move has a Small radius
13HIGH QUALITY VISUAL EFFECTS!
ow
Shizuka: ah, the "FUCK EVERYTHING IN THAT DIRECTION" beam
dawwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Shizuka: considering that they are reality altering beings it's surprisingly good
kitty
13seriously the entire ramiel segment in rebuild 1.0 is one "HEY YOU DIE NOW" after another
DAMMIT MIKURU STOP BEING SO CUTE
dramatic left

meh i dont care what anyone says, haruhi is cuter
13DUN DUN DUN
13dat midi

.....Yuki......
hiya Lyra`
supah zoooom
so this is basically a show about a few highschoolers trying to make a no-budget movie?
Tsuruya!
yes
the hell?
zombies?
XD
i know, i know. but fear not, your benevolent leader shall return
Tsuraya is OOC
Lyra`: yeah yesterday
so theyre filming this movie and the twist at the end is that theyre all actually aliens?
...and you're going to miss my birthday Lyra'! D:
i did no such things, Scoot-Scootaloo, i was harrasing SuperBrony64 the whole time he was talking to her ;3
twilight_sprinkle: no idea
Magnetic mind control?
11,02O3O
DARK_Horst: no its more about high schoolers pleasing a single chick
lol that girls hair is HUGE
Scoot-Scootaloo: wait, when?! :O
Zeus: bc if they don't she'll blow up existence
that is unfortunate
January 11th :'(
sarcastic narrator is best
:O
hey Shizuka, got the rebuild on that system?
Scoot-Scootaloo, most didn't care for my birthday and I didn't mind
I'm getting old..
then how am i going to miss it?
otakon: which is pretty hilarious
13on dvd ja
i get back on the 2nd of january
Oh.... well that's good!
Scoot-Scootaloo: naw, you're young man :3
"where the hell are you taking her, bastard?"
hmmm
well, i was denied my credit card
13but this will already be a long stream and sb wants to go after
rape time
tentacoo grape
ah
well you could just queue up just the ramiel scene aka, the "OH MY GOD! GAINAX ACTUALLY SPENT MONEY ON CGI FOR THE FILM" scene
the narrator sounds like that ordinary guy in the team. maybe theyre filming all this for haruhi
yes
twilight_sprinkle: have you never seen haruhi?
Goldframe: ive only seen some eps on stream
To summarize Yuki: "I'll explain later"
twilight_sprinkle: its a good series, although a rough 2nd season
ok?
Recomended

ULTRA DIRECTOR!
FLCL?
oh god...the dance
@Shizuka: ponies didnt like the saddest stuff ever?
13we didn't get that far
Angel beats wasn't on the level of Kanon or Air
@zeus, the band CPDs song Saddest thing i know?
13we made it to the giant fish before people said WHAT IS THIS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND GO BACK TO PONIES
My copy of this anime has this nice... buzzing sound... when it plays
or even the fuko portion of Clannad
Goldframe: god damn air...
Makes it hard to listen too.
or kathleen turners rendition of nocturne on 9 no 2 on the violin
Shizuka, so what gen did you hit them with?
13i didn't
at any rate i recomend it
awwwesomme. Well I was gona fix my server stuff, but Shizu put anime on.
DROP EVERYTHING!!
/me drops the bass
love this opening
Zeus: Is it because of the jiggle effect that Mikuru gives?
Goldframe: no dude becuase ima sucker for eye rolling Japanes numbers
13yuki is cheating
creepy girl is still creepy
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
god i love this scene
...is everyone a pervert
in this show
Well, Yuki has that ability, so it's not really that much cheating
what is japan without maid cafes? :)
a country with rich history
^
/me hugs twilight_sprinkle
and suddenly perverts everywhere
/me hugs Pinkies4thWall back :3
ohai twilight_sprinkle
http://danbooru.donmai.us/post/show/77242/
ive been here all day, but hi Ryunosuke :P
lol
:p
lol Kandarihu
/me hugs Ryunosuke. HUG PILE
I just read what had to be the single silliest WoW related thing ever. I was on the forums, and someone couldn't find a certain set of dailies-- not impossible. And one person asked "DO you have to fly there? Because I don't have a flying mount."
hey Pinkies4thWall :)
...less than a second after I posted that link, I just remembered something.
what?
Hi Ryunosuke :)
I am now om the way to being a regular at two sites
Kencolt: is that the whole story?
hey thelonepony
13throw a ring and throw away your life
13i'd fund it
Well, even if the player was level 90-- and she was-- I could see that as possible. Then I see she's a druid. Any WoW player here will see the ingerent problem with that.
13oh right
13this is the haruhi singing ep isn't it
yup
band4life
yes
yes it is, and it is a good one
13MEHHHHHH CHOIR WAS ALWAYS BETTER
i havent played wow for years, do they still get the flying transformation spell thing?
Kandarihu: and i say it was an accident and you should forget about it
13woo mosh pit of five
I'm already a regular here. Next stop on my list is Celestia Radio
Zeus: A freaking DRUID. Yes, they do, Ryunosuke . WHy does a druid complain about not having a flying mount?!?
Kandarihu: incident?
thought so
:)
13suddenly haruhi
lol
ima newb bout da wow
Dat face
inb4 song
i saw amvs about it
dat fear and confusion
i laughed a bit too much at that guitarist's playing
Incoming epic time
prepare for the ham and cheese everypony
are there gonna blow stuff up?
13the time to turn you your volume is now
Turn it wich way?
QUICK
TURN IT UP EVERYPONY
up
LEFT
Wait. Shizu. Volume up or down?
13UM
13SIDEWAYS
dat engrish, shizu's watchiung too much dubs
GOOD ENOUGH
oH YEAH THIS BIT
I LIKE LOUD NOISES!!
13my brain's been mush all week .-.
Shizuka: a'www
/me has seen this sung live
<_<
:x
theyre totally i faking, thats not even her voice lull
it is
I have, at a con. it wasn't as good
*faking it
/me morphs into what is now known as Shizu
twilight_sprinkle, accidents are no excuse. I'm not that very much trusted. It's VERY easy to think I posted that link on purpose and claimed it to be an accident. And unless I can PROVE that it was an accident, I'm as good as guilty of doing it on purpose.
this, sket dance, and flcl is the only music ill listen to from anime so far
I can't hear this at all over CR. :P
Oi SuperBrony64, you dere?
Kandarihu: what did you do?
BlazeAngel: you are not Shizu
otakon: Hm?
Kandarihu: yay for being guilty until proven innocent
the_real_pony_1604: let me guess, Anime Expo 2007 in Long Beach?
/me noms on BlazeAngel's + hat :3
Kandarihu: well you dont have to prove it to me, i know it was an accident. and it wasnt even a big deal, weirder things have been streamed
crap
wow i still remember God knows
is anyone else getting random buffer?
no
naw
Goldframe, na local small con.
otakon: eeenope
seriously i just watched a whole damn movie from YT and this is giving me buffer
nope
WHY ?
only in Japan will you have lyrics like this
Needs more Yuki
Lost my music is better
needs more pony
^
ah
So cute.
/me asplodes
13catch yo breath haruhi
how the hell did that stay on youtube then
Eh, it had some woman topless in it, which some other things I stream do has sometimes anyway
Kandarihu: well for starters it wasnt really pornographic, it was just weird, it was an accident and more explicit things have been streamed
have*
not that pornographic then
youtube doesnt even have anything pornographic
13an MD wat
She just ran out of air
sad thing is, I actually still have an MD player
nah i bet she knows circular breathing
"Lost mai musicku"
i like how they had that, her out of breath, added more reality to it
like, Ohm just sang your heart out, well, your perfextly ok, no sweat
lol
Who wants some barbed wire?
Later on, I looked at the entire video. The rest of the video was too creepy, even the 99% of it that wasn't porn. In short, mouths for eyes.
BlazeAngel: me!
/me shoves barbed wire down twilight_sprinkle's esophegus, and out his/her anus
i want some :3
Graphic huh?
DAT ENGLISH
da hell
BlazeAngel: any constantine wire?
13gratuitous english in japanese songs is usually... weird
well... that escalated quickly
13especially if they aren't fluent
/me drags twilight_sprinkle around with a magnet
Shizuka: eeeeeeeeeeeeeeyup
Derpy_Hooves: Nah, but I have a rusty chevrolet.
yeah XD its so fun
BlazeAngel: constantine wire is deadliest wire
Okay, okay. I guess I never set the no linking stuff at all in the main channel in stone, only the #Vinyl_Scratch honorban from posting links until it's been opened 30 times. I'm kind of cheating by counting yesterday moment as one instance, so it's 29 now
naot as bad as a Duckbunny Kandarihu. is it a Duck or a rabbit... no one can say for sure.
Derpy_Hooves: Nah, Limewire is deadliest wire.
can't argue with that
ok Bronystate... love you and all but this Gray pony needs sleep x3
Night Suzano!
G'night Suzano
goodnight! Bronies Tight!
Kandarihu: at least make it 3 times and not 30, 30 is several years
Night Suzano :)
twilight_sprinkle, too late. That much is set in stone.
Good night Suzano!
Schoolgirls...
Oooh.
Kandarihu: how can it be set in stone, its your own decision, not like its physical
goddammit
Kandarihu: tbh, i cant remember that video :$
twilight_sprinkle, I made a promise.
I keep getting buffer every few seconds and I don't know why
alright gonna try clearing the cache
Kandarihu: I think the important thing is that nobody cares~
13still leeching neighbor wifi?
otakon: hows your internet to the site?
Lol
Shizuka: Oooh, ima do tha- DAMN THSE PASSWORDS.
someone should open-close #vinyl_scratch 30 times so Kandarihu can keep his promise :P
Shizuka: yes if you must know, my mom for some reason see's NO point of getting proper internet put into the house
considering the fact that I would pay for it, installation and sevice
Seriously, I'm stretching it too much too much by counting yesterday morning. If you open it 30 times just for the sake of my honorban, I won't count it.
One tree
a tree worthy of the gods
and skippage again
otakon: pay to have your neighbor to have kick-ass internet?
13dat character development
Kandarihu: then at least change it to 5 or something, seriously, 30 times is several years
Snowden: no, I'm using my neighbors wifi and I want to get proper net but my mom doesn't want it installed since we have the neighbors wifi to work off of...
13HARUHI USED GRASS ATTACK
Fail
13it wasn't very effective
and still getting buffer
I don't know why
I just watched a 1h33m movie from YT at 360p with no buffer issues
http://derpibooru.org/174501
otakon, if the internet bill is going to be in your name, it's your account, not your mother's.
13otakon: because youtube loads the video into your cache
13a stream is realtime
360p is demanding
bugger
isnt*
Ponies47: mmphmphm?
Kandarihu: true but that doesn't matter, she doesn't see the point of buying it if we can leech it. I keep telling her it's so we don't have to deal with NOT having it when her's goes screwy.
thelonepony: mmphmphm!
at this point I think I'll just turn my Tablet into mobile wifi and pay it off with debit
mphphmm :3
teach your neighnor how to put a pass, can't longer leecht it, get internet
Rozen Maiden?
oh no
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: no see, my mom doesn't use the net as much as I do and could care less if we didn't have it or not
this song is going to be stuck in my head again
Desu maiden
13oh desu
wow never seen this one before
"Kneel down and lick the bitter tastes of love"
Yeppers
it got to odd for me halfway through the second season
Quick, i need a backstory.
living dolls
otakon pay for it yourself ?
she won't let me get people in here to install it
twilight_sprinkle: http://derpibooru.org/82134
there's your backstory Snowden
okay is there an issue with anyone else's embed volume control?
I can't turn it down
Goldframe: Living Dolls? Got it!
otakon: does that, refresh
otakon get a mobile card ?
I have refreshed
thelonepony: still havent watched cromartie :P
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: like I said I'm going
ogddammit
twilight_sprinkle: well, go watch it :D
SHOW YOURSELF
refreshing the page, this is getting annoying the volume control on the steam is acting up
Mutterguy: do i have anything in any pockets i may have
Criminal scum.
thelonepony i was hoping for a stream of it
it won't stay where it's supposed to
Give it to me.
NOW
twilight_sprinkle: ah, well patience is bliss then
looks like optimus hasn to get in line for that one
thelonepony how long is it?
13uh oh
13suigintou is now xana!
oh shit
just a piece of paper with an address. below it says FIND ME
PURPLE RING
twilight_sprinkle: cant remember tbh :$
it's the bitch!
k
does warratny cover that?
and coma
Mutterguy: getting a Cry of Fear vibe
oh and the pice of paper is an expired coupon for Froghurt
molested by a doll
milestone
Dark92Enigma: irony?
also since we were speaking of several year bans, i feel like i should say this,imo it wouldve been better if we gave a chance to sonicandmario, maybe he wouldve been a cool guy
Mutterguy: go to this Froghurt of which you speak and ask for any wierd recent happenings?
otakon: Dark_Horst, maybe
13twilight_sprinkle: he's more than welcome to start his own channel
what irony?
13it's not hard to make IRC channels, just join one that doesn't have people in it yet
Say shizu, where did thy get thy name?\
Shizuka: but hasn't he been coming for quite some time?
13BlazeAngel: is my name
who is the dark one?
no idea
I've missed too much
I know that shizu, what is it from? Biblical, or what?
Nah the coupon is just a red herring.
BlazeAngel: it's Shizuka
Shizuka: yes but he wanted to talk with the people here, he hasnt done anything wrong so far
^
except for being under age
/me thinks
twilight_sprinkle: But you know how it goes in this chat
and if you have your guardians permission you can come here
randomness
Mutterguy: is the address close by?
otakon: he did have guardian permission though
Our hell... A land of broken PCs...
were talking cities, not blocks
twilight_sprinkle: he said he did
we're pretyy apropriate for an internet chat
Why was Sonicandmario banned anyway?
Kandarihu: under age user
Kandarihu: because he said he was 10
he can ban appeal it however
Oooooh, I see.
you don't know. you remember very little.
What is playing?
also we've had 10 year olds in here
say there
there was one last year
otakon: well he was honest enough to say he was 10, and getting parrental permission isnt something that needs to be lied about
bottom of the stream window
Oh I see it
twilight_sprinkle: dont you remember when wrek stream that Episode of Bullshit? he didnt thought it through
that's why Wrek puts the 18+ warning on it now
i know
seen it in school
dammit
stupid buffer
Lol
STOP PAUSING!
Mutterguy: Explore around where i woke up, look at the addresses to find out my relative location to the adress on the paper
thelonepony: actually, what resulted from that was triggerhappyness on someone elses part. that episode was not more explicit than other things we had on stream. like, game of thrones or misfits (wich had been streamed the same week). nobody cared about that though
Dark_Horst: ah yes, i heard that this place did stream those
meh, imo the religion ep was way more flammable than the pornography one
"Hahahaha"
twilight_sprinkle: true
where is Pinkie when you need her?
...
welp that's a mind break
and BROKEN
D:
Welll...As far you can tell it's on the otherside fo the city. Better stop here . Getting too much into RP for this channel.
Owned by your mind.
But dreams are a manifestation of our desires...
Mutterguy: wrong channel?
Mutterguy: Ok, but that was good for on the spot
this tune. it has drilled a hole in my head
BlazeAngel: and our fears
+BlazeAngel: maybe to a Fruedian
twilight_sprinkle nah I'
True
This is so creepy
http://i.imgur.com/3cZIK.jpg -- this, i lol'd, kill counter maxed, BLOODIEST VIDEO GAME EVER :)
Zeus: you dont need the +, just say the name. press tab to autocomplete a name too
Ryunosuke: lol
*'m just baring in mind the rules.
twilight_sparkle: thanks for da tip
You can tab fail twilight_sprinkle
Mutterguy: oh nvm, i didnt read what you said before, my bad
oh yeah, lol
13WHACK
DerpyMuffins: still better than typing it out
Zeus: Didjoo know, that pain is weakness leaving the body.
Ryunosuke: lol bananas are no laughing matter :D
um
DerpyMuffins: so whats the misping count at anyway?
she has SIX FINGERS!
154
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I was referring to shooting a chicken... with a bow :)
Ah lol
SHE HAD SIX FINGERS ON THAT HAND
otakon: So? She's a doll
Ryunosuke: lol oh yeah
BlazeAngel: modeled after a person
and then the whipping began
otakon: Modelled sure, but changes occur
So what is this anime about?
Snowden we can probably continue, we better just take it elsewhere.
magical dolls
BlazingAngel: yeah dude and fear is just the coward in you slowing your manlines down
Barbetos: Stuff
Stuff is my favorite.
Alright. I'm going to permit myself to post links in the main channel in keeping with the rules. However, there was an important link I wanted to post about a week ago, that a lot of us would be interested to see. It actually pertains to something that's being released tomorrow.
Zeus: Tab fail
Mutterguy: lets save it for another day. im really bad at RP's when im tired
Snowden okies
:D
ok im not gettin this tab stuff
Kandarihu what is it?
Forget the link, TELL ME!!
Mega Man X Street Fighter
Kandarihu: does that include the vinyl_scratch honorban?
Oh.. Huh..
Anyway ever play MorrowWind?
twilight_sprinkle, like I said. That's the only thing that's set in stone.
They made Mega Man look like that fat blue yellow thing did they not?
13morrowind is the best
^
Shizuka: YESH
Shizuka: Dragonborn is good though, GET IT
Morrowind mod for skyrim?
13i tried setting it up to stream but it crashes after like five minutes
Barbetos: Dragonborn comes very close to it
I can't wait for TES online honestly.
Barbetos: What is the point of that?
i like oblivion a bit better but morriwind was good too
Barbetos, Rockman is the same as we know him. It's everyone else who's 8-bit.
Shizuka: lower setting to minimum?
13wat
13no way
Kandarihu: at least reduce it by half or something, 30 times is too long..
also, NEW MEGAMAN ON THE 17th!
and it's FREE
Shizu, nice hustle tons-a-fun, next time eat a salad.
Shizuka: well do you want to show it or not?
Are we watching chibi?
Aight... Sooooo.. Where get Mega Man?
13otakon: the problem isn't the graphical settings
I mean gototherightandjumpman
Barbetos, the Capcom Unity site.
Barbetos: check the capcom site
13asuka doesn't bat an eye at the piles of shaders and enhancements modded onto it
FUCKING DRAGON WINGS
what kind of r63 of sephiroth complains about getting teamed up against
13it's that the core engine is almost 10 years old
Shizuka: yar?
Shizuka: Nice hustle tons-a-fun, next time eat a salad.
whose streaming?
Shizuka: what do you mean its ten years old?
13morrowind is from 2003
whats up bronystate!?
13or was it 2
RDash5000: that depends on your choice of axis
it was 3
I think it was 2
heyo RDash5000
Shizuka: That reminds me of that engine that valve used. Forever.
and was that terrible joke, im afk~
13yeah but at least source is from 2004
*with that
derp
13and they've improved on it
I remember getting a budget copy in 2005
13goldsrc on the other hand is still pretty crap
The problem with posting the link now, is the question of being disrespectful to Shizuka or being disrespectful to SuperBrony64. I won't disrespect either of them.
twilight_sprinkl|afk: you smartass you
theres the bitch slap

adblock and adblock plus do nothing for safari on my mac. I had to install chrome just for freaking ustream stuff

Shizuka: how would they...?
the_real_pony_1604: chrome is better anyway imo

Using a spellchecker and making sure you use proper punctuation and grammar would make it look a lot better to start with.
On an appeal you don't generally say why you want to be unbanned, rather state why you were banned, and what will do differently, what you have learnt, why we should give you another chance, etc.
