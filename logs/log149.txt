I actually do not like Screwball's color scheme...
because luna is amaze
violetvanilla Screwball is Derpy's sidekick
SCOOTALOO WAS FLYING LIKE A CHICKEN
she's a maze?
We maim because we love, Luna.
poor Spike
lol
so the elements are inside her?
Screwball is the new Screwball.
o.o
13Screwball got popular and fast
Luna is corn?
THE princess
>This is pretty amusing :3
cause corn is niccceeeee
which one?
I'd really like to know about #lobby.
Cele, you benevolent sadist
There were only 26 episodes. And only 25 letters.....
Screwball is 4th jock pony
kill......me........
Derpy > Screwball FOREEEEVEEER

Kind of now.
I think Luna helps them
Though none of us would dream of maiming YOU Luna.
(5 bonus points if you get the place the quote is from)
Because stuff going down, yo.
oh god poor Rainbow Dash
NATURAL HORN ENHANCEMENT
Luna?
This bit's the closest I've come to tearing up in ages, thanks ponies
So that's where Screwball comes from.
RUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAA
since Celestia never did anything helpful
nice one GGGala
 Why were there like 100 scrolls when only 24 episodes had a message at the end?
RECOLORED
LordCelestia implying there weren't adventures we didn't see
thats a hell of a lot more letters than i thought
07,01i'm a little busy in the background :)
TvTrope: Crowning Moment of Heartwarming
LET'S DO THIS
and letters we didn't see
Ghehe, no worries.
This was really a good way to cap off Season 1, actually. Am surprised they waited for Season 2 to do it.
Twilight likes to send spam-letters.
because of all the adventures we didn't get to see
inb4 spike explodes
inbtween episodes mor stuff happens
first thing you said?
poor spike lol
maybe stuff happened that we didn't see, LordCelestia?
08,01o-o
wait they actually referenced nightmare?
Yes.
is the sky falling?
luna maiming is a crime
EPIC STANCE
08,01I dunno where she be. She be busy?
It's this scene that makes me think this works better as a Season 1 finale than a Season 2 opening.
and then he explodes again
A heinous crime.
06She sent multiple copies of the same ones?
you mean "All the ponies in this town are crazy!"

zecora was in the crowd
yea
that was a good short movie
didn't you notice?
"Behold, peons! Your future predator!"
i know right?
oh wait theres more
this makes so much sense
Scar ate the mouse!
there are also zombie ants but something different happens
oh hi scar
ohai mark
Zecora must have left when Simba vanished and Scar took over.
suddenly veemi offline...

I don't know, Frollo burned down quite a bit of Paris.

Silly Flaschen, not enough love given. If Luna was single and I was near her, I'd totally hit her and get dumped in a few seconds
Foreshadow!
All the while /knowing/ that he was in the right, as a just and pious man.
Lord Mufusa.

Scar is a pussy(see what I did there)

FORESHADOWING
3I think Fluttershy` exploded
Phallic Symbol Mountain!

Hope not. D:
so simba you can not rule where the sun dont shine.
Maybe she exploded...then exploded again
Same Kirz.
....can you do that? Can you explode twice?
o.o
Yes
I thought that was behind us!
phallis is now known as pride rock.
Nice C&C mouse... ?
all connected by canibalism
wtf
Dat SE song.
Ah, this is the remastered version.
I dont recall this song.

So many puns
This is new.

:P
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOORNING REPORT~
I can't even remember most of this film, haha

06What about #lobby?
We haven't paid the hornbill

this should be in the special features, not main movie
I love his voice.
07,01this is the SE :)
See? :)
07,01I was included
Mufasa voice is smexy
who is the VA?
He's james earl jones.
Simba's voice is sexy!
i think i preferred it without this song
is that a girl singer?
you would know him better as Darth Vader or Thursa Doom (from conan)
yeah this was defenatly not in the movie when I saw it.
What's it for?
Doesn't make the film any worse, really. It just feels a bit surplus.
except for the puns
Same.
killing the bird runs in the family i guess
i love the puns
07,01it's just a song
08,01o-o
07,01don't worry
Oh
HE IS VADER?

was not worried, was just unexpected.
ohoho

simba is such a tool
10,2So, it's bad for Hyenas to hunt in pride land and it's good for the Lions?
Remember this for later
Hyenas are not worthy!
tempting fate at his best O_o
exactly SuperBrony64
Scar is a Monkey's uncle
RACIST!
...HAHA I SNUCK IN
"Quit rubbing it in, you little brat -_-"

WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME?
An uncle saying "it's our little secret" is creepy in this day and age.
06It is for Fluttershy to go in and stun the rest of the chat members with her shyness and beauty and stuff~
the question of the day is. who is nalas father
Dat plot-lick
I am the father!
Da wata ho'? Wat so great 'bout the wata ho'?
"My body is ready!!!"
Zazu!
checked on Wikipedia, Scar's birth name was Taka

what about kingdom hearts?

it was easy
specifically 2 cause the first one sucked
Uhoh.
kingdom hearts 2 was a sad excuse compared to 1
....
Nala is rainbow dash
A debate on which game's the better of the two? :P
nala wub woo
lol
This can only end well.
I am mad jelly of their singing voices xD
was taht dashes so awsome face?
i enjoyed the combat more in 2
1's felt too clumsy
Getting video game flashbacks.
what? Mash Triangle to win everything?
It's ALMOST as non-controversial as a debate on the quality of Sonic games.
RAAAAGE.
Count me out! Out of Service! Out of Equestria!
lol Si
Oy you two, that'll do! :P
Wish Disney movies still had musical numbers.
you're not alone
:D
:P
lash that doesnt count
/me whispers to Lasharus, "Should I mention the gameboy version?"
(Anyways,i'm bored.Seeya all some other time!)
is this a new verse?
they did make a pretty good one with the frog princess
07,01nope
What, Chain of Memories?
WE DONT TALK ABOUT THAT
but that really only happened because racism
hehe
Neat story, clunky execution.
TABOO
it didn't exist...
07,01princess and the frog was amazing :)
Oh shut up.
I love all Disney movies!
i hated this level on the game
like the mythical 3rd matrix film
07,01Also.. how about I up the quality a bit?
there was no such thing
Tangled made me cry xD
TABOO
all propaganda
Story-wise it worked. It was just bad gameplay.
10,2I hated this level in the video game :P
Do it filly!
THE BLUE MONKEYS
if you can do that Luna
yes luuna
I hated the video game: full stop
without streaming
it also made no fricken sense
without stopping the stream
yesplz
:D
the video was hard as alls
Actually, it's understandable.
07,01hehe .. I have to stop the stream a moment
K.O
lol
you have to remember to forget? memories how do they $&)($*# work?!
Do it filly again!
07,01alright here we go
I never got past Level 2. :(
Dat Rhino.
13Dat rhino plot
what didn't make sense of the mirror-world castle that existed above and below ground and stole your memeories?
I just can't wait to be king!
13Is even biggesr than mine
~~
OMG STRERAM!
Well yes, but if you consider that, none of the Organisation makes sense either.
13Inb4 impossible!
Impossibru !
dat face
3Y U PAUSE!?
10,2Good stopping point :P
i didn't say impossible so =P
dat face! :D
Smug cat.
thats cause its a final fantasy game
best pose to pause
face = Bitch Please
did the movie pause?
yar
Luna did it
No, that's because it's a Kingdom hearts game.
luna paused it
13;P
Octavia's Plot is still the most Glorious!
and then the stream was no more
with her magic moon powers
There're completely different writers behind it.
Bitch please, I'mma be king!
10,2Stefan: Why is your name Stefan?!
Dat quality is so much better!

Bitch please, I'm Simba
07,01and we're back
<3
Roleplaying
Smug Simba is smug.
i think were getting side tracked
inb4 massiv lag
Why hello Aloe~
/me hugs Aloe
disney games are bad because they're disney games, kingdom hearts is a final fantasy game with disney characters, different development
/me is now known as... oh, wait...
cat fight!
cat fight
07,01if it lags i'll switch back
ninjad
doesnt make the story any less derpy
I still quite enjoy Kingdom Hearts.
girl's on top =p
GET OUT OF THERE!
works fine
Even makes sense that Nala keeps winning those little tussles.
why does Nala have a southern accent?
i recently played through KH2
she sounds like AJ
13She likes being on top..
dem bone
And really, the stories in the Final Fantasy games are of fairly good quality.
but higher pitched
I'd rate them above most of the regular ff games that have come out recently
Remember who does the hunting in lion prides.
dem bones
they like it, kitty style ;)
Isn't her VA used on MLP as well?
Some exceptions exist, of course.
07,01who does'nt
07,01:P
13 was an absolute goddamn atrocity.
xD
I disliked 12.
Oh Luna~
07,01Evil luna!
who can't wait for 13-2 YAAAAY
-.-
omg Octavia and luna stop taking my mind there =p
what like final fantasy 13: a movie disguised as a game?
And (Arentius will kill me for this) 8 was horrid.

Yes Scar.
This i a kids movie, we don't need sauciness!
13Hmm...
Luna getting dirty. WHAT IS THIS MADNESS?
11 + 14 were online only so don't count, 13 was waaaaaay too linear
oh simba, you so brave...
I wrote a review on 13, actually.
dude I always say that line with the film
13LunaxOctavia shipping.... goodness!
taboo
Oh-kay, time to leave, methinks
EU RIO DA CARA DO PERIGO AHAHAHAHAHA
Best ship ever!
The summary: A 60-hour movie where you're allowed to press a button or two.
8 was a fine game...the junction system was just too complicated
/me likes Luna getting naughty
..... i'll be in my bunk.
1 was the best
>yfw you didn't understood shit
And the story was batshit.
once you got the hang of it it was fine
GUINAN IS A HYENA!
...the story was fine
Sorry Alex, but there're too many bullshit plotholes.
Growing up, I always thought Zazu was saying "Major Dodo". I now realize he was saying Majordomo.

unicron but a femal
0.o a birdy boiler.
"yeah, I'll join a terrorist group for a random city I couldn't give a toss about because I want to spite my dad. Also, have this train-base"

Didn't the Galbadian army NOTICE one missing!?
she just used it
QUIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEET!

Foreshadowing much?

Jeremy Irons! I WANT YOUR VOICE!
mmm, wildebeest.
Mostly because, having used Alex's strategy for it, you could break the one in 2 completely.
but in kingdom hearts one you couldnt do infinite combos with berserk
That's not clunky.
jeremy iron cereal, there is no prize at the end of the box
That's 'unbroken'
I'm so hungry, i could eat a wildebeest.
dat "go" face
dat chameleon dgaf
*rawr* = *yay*
Is "let's go" face a refernce to something?
STAMPEEEDE
I always wondered what that thing was when I was a kid.
i honestly couldnt do it without berserk
Just being awesome Tovler.
Oh shi-
The horror the horror

WE NEED AJ'S HEARDING SKILLS!
WHERE'S APPLEJACK?!
i love the use of voice in this soundtrack
its freakin hard
I'm too slow for everything, I quit Dx
lol
l2type
Wildebeest dun give a fuck.
:D
considering one of his moves is a one hit KO
After hearing Alex' strategy, Sephiroth was a pushover.
we cheat, Scorchman1337 we know the movie already.
sephiroth 2nd game?
took him out at lvl 30
Widebeest should have been one of the Teen Titans
This is my first time =(
13This part of the game make me rage sometimes.
Death, Betrayal
liar
Child's movie
Like I said we cheet,
nope
...
13*made
Herdmind.
you cant fight him at level 30
this was the first use of computerised flocking in film
Sure you can.
the final level is level 50ish
you can..it just usually ends in horrible death
scortchman1337 ZOMG wat? Awesome. Welcome to best disney movie.
I never completed the song part lol
What of it?
if you dont kill anything you dont need to
you can get there low level
pimp slap
I was deprived as a child =(
06>yfw That is Mr. Bean.
Low level games are doable.
and i didnt grind at all and i still hit 50
Poor Zazu.
Very poor Zazu.
Nala. WAT.
I had no NES or Genesis
Everyone beats up Zazu.
nom
GLOMP
Dat part now
Mulan is best disny movie
you need to anti grind
Nope, but if you don't run away from fights, you barely grind, but you do hit around lvl 50.
this is second
That voice actor is Mr. Bean? :0
no, TLK is the best
*SNES*
Mulan was second
seriously?
I am best movie
wow
>imo
Let's get down to business
if you just ignore everything but bosses and forced fights
i dont think i want to do that
but yeah
06Zazu is Rowan Atkins, Ja.
Home on The Range. trollface
It's not necessary.
that sounds aggravating as hell
;_;
Grab my paw mufasa!
Nala: no he's not? really?
reflectega when sephiroth does his fire pillar
nope.avi
cast it 2/3 times
ADVENTURE!
There's only one way he could do that voice.
07,01meanie!
But beating Sephiroth is simply easy. Abusing Reflectga and you're done.
nope.avi
you'll wipe out about 6-7 hp bars each time
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
LONG LIVE THE KING!
Long Live the KING
http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/
Magic *snort* *snort*
aww thats dumb
The king is dead Long live the KING

thats cheating
06http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/
Yup.
damn I cried at this part
That big....dumb....MEANIE
3Looks like he failed his climb roll
06Ja he is.
then hit him with a combo to finish him off
just unequip all combo boosters
No, that's breaking the fight with standard mechanics.
cool!
3 hits done
Lmao I actually clikced the no button xD
LOL Crikettwb
it's just not fair *sniff* you know?
The Kingdom Hearts 1 version of the fight was infinitely more complex.
Arrest those wildebeest
pff id rather just berserk his health down and have a REAL fight
rowan atkinson is amazing
have you ever seen his stand up?
nah I'm not watching this 2 times in a day
Having around about 4-5 phases, as I recall.
daddaddaddaddad.
Gonna pass out the tissues now =(
At least pixar movies still make you cry.
i did have a real fight...i just didn't realise people in SOLDIER were idiots :P
07,01we streamed mr Bean in the pre-show
games have been getting dumbed down for years, just look at WoW
again, aggravating as hell
you probably thought Mufasa was real...Nope! Chuck Testa
Uhoh.
WoW debate.
DAAAAWWWWWWWW
taboo
omg no Tovler, Pixar movies make me bawl my eyes out
i can't stand Mr. Bean
Fuck I am crying right now
He is deaded.
TABOO
/me is sad he missed preshow now
/me has seen him live when she went to visit Oxford.
You'll excuse me, I'll go sit in a corner now.
I am supposed to have grown up
10,2The moment that has been imprinted to the hearts of millions of viewers :(
but i like pretty much everything else rowan atkinson has done
The circle of life!
after the miilion times I've watched it
06His stand up is funny.
That noo button ruined this moment, I can't stop laughing
Did anyone get the license plate for that herd of wildebeest?
not debated, just stating fact :p
Yes.
/me saw Bill Bailey live in Edinburgh
A debatable fact.
Rowan is a comedy god
'cuz dere's been a hit-and-run
/me can handle it once. But Twice a day? He just starts sobbing.
okay we need a crying break =(
Now stop that.
TABOO
hehe :D
so is Bill Bailey
I know I'm too easy to drag into these kinds of discussions.
rowan is a master of comic timing
HA! Nemo's mom died
/me cries
That black bastard!
deliopen And now I can't stop laughing over your comment!
WHY GOD WHY!
Incidentally, anyone who states an opinion as fact in any discussion, I consider the loser of the discussion.
i will eat this roast beef sandwhich

This is the first time I've teared up in a long time ;_;
Disney knows how to make me sob. :(
/me is still giggling about the "noooooooooo" button

/me is wondering where Simba is right now.
Hey!
Nope.
KIll him.
newp
/me initiates Group hug
He's the Brit, I'm the Dutchy.
/me takes her pizza back
I love this music.
However, I sound more British.
how positively not british of you luna
Hello Rainbow-Dash
and the first thing lash ever said to me was "piss off you git"
/me is a Dutchy too
Hi
just as he said "kill him" i got a message on reddit, so derpy said "i brought you a letter!"
That was because you were whining at me being OP.
Zeph, this is my last slice! :(
kid's on a roll
i can flyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy......ok,maybe not
I have been here, just had to refresh the page
Which I weren't.
No i said mages were op
hey there T_T
still implying that Hyenas are dogs
its not my fault i was a noob
Sumica: DAT PUN
ahhh, memories.
The last is always the best
NOM
dat thorns!
and then all the mood died
In case you're wondering - we've had this debate before.
couldn't tell ;p
many many times :P
Cactus butt FUN
cactus butt! ha!
Cactus butt~
I think they added theis part to stop the audience from crying.
Well it's your bloody fault.
you think Kalisia?
still crying
Yeah! It's probably a good idea to let the enemy run away without killing him!
unless you come back in 5 years way bigger then you are now.
yep
pfft
pretty sure I've heard this debate before too, and not from you two ;)
just because i was wearing all whites and meleeing...
This plan cannot backfire.
^
ominous shadows are ominous.
nice moon luna
So, in the course of these two years, why doesn't Scar get any off-spring?
07,01ty
THE DARKNESS SHALL RULE. . . . . . . .FOREVER!!!!
as a hunter....
Luna always has the best skies
fuck Celestia
what.
haha
why
Espy: Three words: Lion King Two
Maybe he's sterile, EspyLacopa... ?
Luna is best alicorn
and her bright cannot-look-at-it sky
i was a noob back in the day
because...
He was lvl 26 or so.
give me a time machine
CriticKitten: There is no such movie.
lash was lvl 19
Just started playing.
Mind you, I was just as bad. Just better.
Scar chose Nala as his mate (Stage Musical Version)
EXACTLY
Lauren faust is best alicorn
im going to smack the younger you upside the head
he had decent gear for a start
did he at least have a pet?
yes
i did
And that's why Scar never had kids.
07,01So who is gonna try guildwars2 ?
I think so, yes.
i wasn't that stupid
Probably on passive.
critickitten there's only 1 and 1 and a half
ME! :D
07,01me too
it's
Not me luna, was too dissapointed in GW1

Not me Luna. I'm still enjoying WoW. I really can't afford another MMO impinging on my time.
get in the car
07,01I was dissapointed in GW1
I'm moving to swtor
Yes, the Vultures were going to eat Simba.
gw2 is shaping up to be so much better than gw1
i might but im playing vindictus
07,01but GW2 looks promising

it's lion!
Lol, it's a little lion. A white lion.
13Horey shet its a car! Get in the lion!
06XD
07,01and who's getting SS3?

06Yes, get in my belly~ >D
swtor is too much like wow for my taste
which one is ss3?
eh i'm going for the pvp aspect
/me climbs up Zephirdd's nostril

Crickettwb: Yeah. I'm glad they never made any sequels. Just like with the Matrix.
/me doesn't know wat a nostril is due to non-nativity on English
O_o
Trying to load that comic and now my stream is derping up xD
/me is depressed

HAHAHHAHA
timone and pumba are hilarious
I already said I'd pick it up Luna. :P
07,01why did you do that Scorchman1337!
The Lion King is copied from Kimba The White Lion, if I remember correctly
It's the hole in your nose, Zeph. :0
Timon is a dick
Who wants bacon?
07,01goodie good!
LOL.
Holes. Plural
Idk, I'm sorry Luna D'=
You gotta your behind in your pass.
I had my faith in GW2 shaken when they announced with much hoopla that you could JUMP in this one.
*put your
Critickitten: The only Matrix movie i've ever seen was the last 15 minutes of the last movie. I don't know why everyone hates it. I thought it was awesome. I need to see the first though.
I'm.... not sure why he's invading your nostril
07,01can you fly?
brb, dad is cutting the internet for a second
07,01:o

Not in RL, no. :P

So timon and pumba are rosecrantz and gulderstern?
i has jetpacks
07,01yay
In WoW - without much effort.
Mostly because it makes no sense, Crickettwb :P
and here comes history
07,01I know in WoW...
akunamatata

Crickettwb: the first movie was so much better than the other two, that people hate them
yes TheMaster
(but then, none of the trilogy does)

Well, if we're talking in our personae Alex, then yes, I can fly.
07,01Still have me LK drake..

0.o must see first now.
The Egg Carrier is still perfectly airworthy, after all.
07,01I was talking about GW2
Same here Luna.
I have no idea if you can in there Luna.
i don't even know what my persona is...
wow, this song is English... ehh... huh.. sucks.

...Timon just shaved off one of Simba's claws. Do those grow back?
in GW you just push the city's button and you're there, beats flying
07,01ik stonk altijd een uur in de wind

Yes.
Oh, good.
I'm confused Luna.....
I invited a friend to try wow...and they played without me and nobody would help or even talk to them

I should relearn my Duch German and Japanese
06Google Translate will not help you here.. .
06XD
Which means I have to do a bunch of questing in the outlands to get access to the dungeon the key itself is in.
13Oh goodness... online translators, lawl
07,01You won't need keys for the crypts..
I remember those days, when you needed keys and quests to actually raid
Google Translate is for the week
Rafiki is so awesome.
It's for the week, Dumori? Then what's next week?
You are, a squashed banana?
Raiki is...interesting

too easy ^^
YEAh
Cretin.
i have my moments but come on
indeed CriticKitten
07,01so yea.. what do you like about Cataclysm and what not?
Smacking him with the stick, that is. I never realized how perfect that was. *appreciation +1*
inbr D:
13I got the Brewfest kobo on my druid this year... and I have it on acouple 80s too, cant remember which tho... lol
*inb4
cataclysm is what caused me to eventually quit...so yeah :P
*stroke*
13I mean my DK
disappointing :(
not much love there
07,01yep me too..
inafter inafter inb4
it does many things right, but equally many things wrong.
though wotlk was the worst
13But my DK also has the Big Love Rocket, and thats my mount of choice. ;)
I am disappointed. Can't find a Discord shuffling gif animation.
07,01I never expected I would quit WoW...
I don't think the problem is with Cataclysm specifically, but more with the game's age.
yo dog i heard you liked being in
Rafiki is G-Monkey
Hey guys, the king has left the building.
its not even the games age
I feel it is.
its the mentality of the playerbase
Who's on first?
the game is fine
13Cata made the game a little harder than Wrath at least.
http://www.discodiscord.com/ <Nittany_Tiger
That's definitely true.
I'm prone to taking several month long breaks in between a month of playing.
wasnt Scar the uncle of a Monkey?
but everyone wants everything for free
13Wrath was stupidly easy.
IM FRIST LOL
Epic run music.
which was wraths fault
YOUR FRIST LOL?
RUNNING SEQUENCE GO
07,01I loved the LK fight
I want to exercise to that music.
wotlk needed more ulduar
YA I FRIST U JELLY?
And yes, *you're.
I think TBC was the best in terms of difficulty/accessability
If the Monkey's Simba's Uncle and Scar's a Monkey's Uncle. WHO IN THE PRIDE MARRIED A MONKEY?!
07,01and the vid at the Wrathgate
Awesome deliopen. Thanks.
YA I JELLY
13Ulduar... that was the best one in Wrath.
If he's in the desert?
so,did scar throw a nuke on pride land?
Sure thing, Nittany.
07,01Yea, I agree
"Let's get down to business..."
Wouldn't he be running the wrong way?
lol
oo wrathgate chain was my favy
it had more than 2 difficulty levels on most of the fights, made it a lot more challenging
13The cinematics too, all nicely done.
kind of hard to change it this way in another way
But it's not a downloadable .gif
everyone below the line is jelly because Im frist

For heaven's sake, if you plan to threaten me, do it right.

I do have standards you know, I don't just let ANYONE threaten me.
13Eh, I think people will start loosing more and amore interestin in WoW before Blizzards like "lets just pull the plug"
a rusty spoon!
oh definately
10,2Somehow…somewhere…my evil twin is trying to destroy me...
i mean numbers are rapidly dwindling atm
i will slit you're throat and bring you to a world where pain is god and I am the pope.
though i think it's steady atm
13Yeah, WoW is already loosing its players a little bit
\m/_ d^_^b _\m/ rock
scar you are not pinkie

Scar is stupid lol
OH HE MAD
Let's be fair, they're kinda running out of villains in the game.
Scar: From Strategic Mastermind to Pussycat. OH HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN
breakin out da pimpin hand
07,01Well.. to be honest.. I hate activision
they have killed most of them
yup
activision ruined wow for me
07,01yep
13Its still massive of course, but yeah, its loosing a little at a time now
they also buggered up the guitar hero franchise
Imba
did i threaten you with proper mechanics lash?
they just flog the horse until it dies
then flog it some more
it's not just activision
James: no Willam: no :bill: no
Many companies are good at that.
07,01it's shareholders too...
EA.
can't blame half the company :p
UbiSoft.
Tell me why shouldn't I kill you RIGHT NOW
I think there's the head titan in charge of the Burning Legion (I don't think he's been killed yet), and I know there's still some Old Gods kicking around.

EA didn't push out 11 incarnations of the same game in 1 year
:3
sargares got knocked off in sunwell didn't he?
yep
'Twas a good game.
Pick now, die or die.
Horde lost a lot of awesomeness when Thrall stepped down as warchief.
Nah, that was Kil'Jaeden Kirz.
he didn't "die" i think
07,01Thrall will be back
Violence solves everything. Psh, go for it.
07,01eventually
And he didn't die, he merely got banished back into the Twisting Nether.
was? SC2 is a fucking awesome e-sport
:|
thrall didn't leave...he's just taking care of the deathwing problem
I pick the second option Sumica, its obviously the one where you fail to kill me.
07,01But Garrosh.. I hate that guy...
LIES
Thrall did step down as warchief.
13Garrosh is such a hardass lol
07,01I do love my little gobbywobby though
Garrosh is a tit.
Granted, if he comes back and tells Garrosh to piss off. . .
they did that to push more of the alliance/horde pvp side of it
And I'm not very fond of the Goblins, if I'm honest.
13But I'm not familiar with the deeper Warcraft lore
NO EVIL GLOATING!
At least the Horde Goblins.

/me hugs Luna ~yay~
It's the US proposing a law. Of course they want it global.
d'aww
(sorry, that was a bit crude of me, wasn't it? :P)
its to "end piracy"
they are still fighting it, but its probably going to go through
however

NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Wait, are you putting that one Robbin Williams movie on again?

videogames are ok
http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/
just movies and tv
07,01yep

that's because most people in my country are idiots and believe their ideas are right for everyone else
apparently its been ammended
thank fuck for that
/me did a Disney movie marethon once where she watched every one up untill The Emperor's New Groove in a four day span.
also videogames count as art which you cannot copyright

The worst part of The Lion King is the fact that it's over now. :(

That makes perfect sense Scar.
Better hope they don't try and tell that to Ebert and Roper.

Huh, the Tier 3 Raid set isn't available in the game anymore?
07,01Don't worry too much

Pirates find a way to circumvent what the lawmakers want. They react.

Kay, now I think i'll start on the report due tomorrow. Toodles to you all!
if they are going to say "I have an unbeatable system"
It has humans on it?
/me probably can not watch the second movie again. .
Thank you Luna!
because Luna is best pony
someones gonna go "LOL NO YOU DONT"
06No more tears left ;A;
Indeed. :D
/me hugs Nala
regardless, unless i find a way to secretly use this proxy and not get caught, im screwed
they then say "prove it"
SCAR I HAVE IT
I'll watch the livestream
http://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/226195.jpg
I'm glad for the restream or else I would've never known how amazing this movie was xD
and share my screen with you
07,01I don't think so.. people will always find ways
mwahaha
07,01but we'll see in due time I guess
Yeah, it really is.
07,01alright brb
that would work, if my comp wasnt broken to hell and couldnt run screen share
07,01refilling my glass
espy just use the transmogrifier
What Dreams May Come is a good one, too.
*could
Wish there were films these days at this caliber.
/me hugs Luna back~
Just doesn't happen as often.
right seriously time for a spoon and nutella brb
Arentius: I know. But you have to own the item that has the appearance you want as well as the item you're changing.
ahhh i didn't know that
fail :(
Put it this way Scar - these laws are only to scare off the dumber pirates.
When you get right down to things, they're practically impossible to actually enforce.
poor Luna forsaking sleep for our entertainment
but what if they do?

OMFG
you cant tell me its impossible, because its not
its improbable
I just strongly doubt they would.
but possible
First step really is to remove anonymity on the internet.
and as long as that possibility exists i have a problem
>YFW that's Lauren Faust OC as the mother
But what about luuuuuuuunaaaaaa
Put it this way: If you watch a stream of copyrighted content, you could get sued?
well imma head out guys, need to study for macroeconomics, later guys and gals
lol, just saw that one
Do you know how many lawsuits that would result in?
no, they will shut off my internet
cya scorchman1337
its apparently a 3 strike thing
Even that would be hard to get through.
is jonathan coulton coming over the stream, or is it just me?
but still POSSIBLE
Internet companies wouldn't like to lose about 50% of their customers.
ill be right back i have to empty my garbage
Because enormous amounts of people WILL watch streams regardless.
okay, it's just me
i have no idea how that turned on
06JoCo~ <3
have you heard his new album?
especially if ponies are involved
06o:
And Espy - that won't happen.
06New?
bacckkk
Wb.
also its up to the individual company to prosecute you
and i doubt hasbro will care about ponies being live streamed
/me is dancin' to the beat
yup
just released
07,01and back
it's called Artificial Heart, and has some awesome songs
From what I know, they've actually stated that they don't mind.
indeed
x3
they haven't endorsed it, but they haven't banned it, which is what you'd expect if they were going to allow it
Huh, there's a recolored version of that tier 2 set in BC heroic dungeons. . .
I know.
There's also a mage T1 recolour, which I own.
I also own the Warlock T2 recolour.
I'm a mad collector :P
obsessed collector*
(18 sets and counting)
Heh
oh btw lash
/me has already spent a bunch of cash to get a full set of portable holes
i never did use my light of elune
Hah.
This comes as no surprise.

07,01I deleted all my old sets...
i dont think you can even earn the item anymore
/me cries
/me hugs Luna.
LOL
You poor thing :(
yfw 3600 dollars plus 200 shipping
/me cuddles luna
/me is deeply disturbed by some of the siderooms
its ok
07,01I needed space!
yfw shipping has lots of meanings
I'm SURE it'll hit $4000.
So do I. Believe me...
It MIGHT hit $5000.
lawl
06>yfw the last bid was Dari

Dear Princess Celestia, I learned never to stream on Sunday afternoons during football season. Your friends will dislike laggy quailty.

Tears as in what comes out of your eyes, or tears as in clothing?
07,01maybeeeeee
/me hugs Zephirdd
For my EYES, you.

07,01I had alarm clock like that...
As sad as it is, I have to study under Celestia's sun instead of Luna's beautiful moon
It was the first date movie my girlfriend and I shared.

Well, first romantic movie.
07,01Goodnight Arentius
Goodnight everyone and catch you later :) sweetdreams

Lol
FreezeFrame: That's terrible! D:
I heard that sucked.
07,01yep...
:D
Top gun was the first vhs I ever saw =p
and so our numbers dwindle
Heh, bad SyFy movies are only good for hanging out, rarely for romantic nights. xD
actually we're back to 10, same as when I got here
:P
Actually, we enjoyed it
07,01Also...
Which one was it?
07,01let me use my powers!
Not the movie
07,01Tadaaaa!
The date we made out of it

Ah, that's the best kind of way to watch them. :D

07,01* Luna sets mode: +o Octavia
ohhh
Uhoh.
07,01Octavia is a mod now in this room

People're going to whine for mod-status of the channel now Luna. :P
hehe
im just kidding
Point proven, thank you Scar.

07,01Well Octavia is a team-member :)

Dead people
Not worth watching again.

I think Luna's mod name is Sathi.
06Was a weird and messed up one, but still very good :3
/me smiles at Viola
but what is your team colour
I was talking about the fact that you're marked as having Twilight as your favourite pony on the 'about' page Luna.
I'd be happy as long as it was AJ, lol.
07,01we dont have team-colours
Flutterguy: What Dreams May Come
07,01also my name should have been updated..

And this is how one should not catch cars.
What Dreams May Come, pony_1757

/me missed the LOL part

It's nice to have active mods in this channel btw. :)
/me hugs Luna and Octavia.
Heh, Silverscreen's favorite movie was Lion King.
Dear Celestia, what the heck am I watching
So just DEAD then?
13I hope some actually try for the DA Art Competition >.<
yep dead
07,01yep
13I'll be sad if we get no entries. :(
That's... one /hell/ of a car accident, flying through the air like that
Awful way to die. Just trying to help someone else. :(
my chat just froze up
nope locked in syndrome
Don't look at me Octavia, I'm afraid I have no drawing skills whatsoever :(
07,01there will be
07,01give it time!
I'll be putting something in, just have to get an idea first :p
13Awww. XD
oh god blurry nacked people
I should really try my hand - or hoof - at writing again though.
just remember
infamous 2 is mine
13I'm patient, I'm patiant! Dont I look patient! *big grin*
The car didn't even screech its tires
no horn
i will write infamare
07,01eeeeenope
13D:
13>:|
"Doc"?"Time doesn't count"? Dear god he's in a dream sequence with doctor who
Ghehe.
/me AJ poker faces
lol
evil karma twilights story must be told
/me plops AJ hat on
If I write a crossover, it'll probably involve Robotnik.
Though someone was there before me :(
just to kill off zeke rainbowdash
(good fic though, that)
he just saw the ramp and Robin Willians and said Challenge Accepted
was i the only one who played infamous 2?
Possibly.
so nopony is going to get it when i write infamare?!
One of the hardest conversations to have with your child.
More or less :(
Tovler, acheavment unlocked.
played the first one
but infamous 2 is so much better!
Sorry Scar, but I can't play EVERYTHING.
sigh
I had that conversation twice. I know.
and is also still $60
rainbow
Double* rainbow.
it's easyer if the kid has a fish
Both my pets died within the last year ;_;
so nopony will feel sad when zeke dies?
Who's Zeke?
/me hugs deliopen
they get mad if you try to flush any thing fluffy.
/me hugs deliopen.
Heh, death discussion is very difficult. :/
the main characters best friend
brohug
my cat died just over a year ago
but i have a new cat now
scam artist
he betrayed him for powers then risked his life to try and save him
unfortunately, i have also developed cat allergies...
Deliopen, both my dogs died within 2 years. I know the feeling too.
and in infamous 2 hes doing all he can to make things right
they reconcile about 80% through the game
I had a dog and a rabbit, the rabbit died in the last month.
and in evil karma
Also, thanks guys
you have to kill him
Oh good. A moral choice system.
Of course.
except you have become attached to him
so you feel really bad
now imagine that
but with ponies
My dog died while I was at college. We arranged to have her put to sleep at a time that I could be there. It's always really tough. *hugs deliopen*
with twilight as cole macgrath, the electric mare
I know what it's like, too - my family usually has three or four cats, so I'm used to dealing with it, as sad as it is to cope with, or to say
Oh yes, now I recall.
my mother killed my cat by accident
the demon of epiyah ponyville
the cat could only eat through a syringe and was on her way out anyway
I saw a Zero Punctuation on that.
oh
Oh wow. :(
well yahtzee hates everything so shush
07,01sooo what did I miss?
my mum was trying to feed her, but the cat choked on the food
my rabbit was like that, till we put him down
that's depressing.
07,01was dealing with kitty litter...
That'd make me cry, trying to feed my kitty like that.
Scar's infamous 2 rant
just me marking my territory for infamare
I don't take Yahtzee as actual reviews Scar, I'm not THAT thick.
with ponies
/me hugs all the sad ponies
13I just love the face she gets when shes lieing... hilarious.
i claim the fanfic
its mine
i have pictures of it :(
He tells us what he dislikes in a comedic manner.
Nothing wrong with that. I love his style, in fact.
derpy just brought me a letter!
:'(
Yahtzee didn't hate Portal.
ITS BUCKING MINE!
yeah I am done watching this chat for some time till the mood gets better.
07,01he did?
My rabbit tried to refuse to eat and drink. It's terrible when they won't eat and drink.
And he was remarkably positive about the last two games he reviewed.
dont touch
I wasn't planning to Scar...
mine...
6_9
You sound like Rarity in greed-mode.
/me hugs all around
"MIIIINE"
/me hugs everypony
id be so mad if someone stole it from me
Mmhmm.
/me tries to cheer up everypony
:(
I don't play the game, nor do I particularly want to, so the likelihood of me doing that are low, at best.
/me hugs everypony tightly
/me pulls all night writing mode, steals fanfic.
/me hugs everypony
:)
:'(
06It will be okay~
That's a good idea..
...
06Shhh shhh~
:[
Nyahahahaaa!
right on cue, my cat has come and sat on me
Also, yeah, I agree with deliopen and Sumica
and now i can't breathe
Sorry, my Robotnik-fanboyism leads me to break out in evil laughs every once in a while.
It's a tic.
thanks cat
that.
don't worry, I can't write that fast unless I get some really good inspiration
Yeah. Always get mushy-eyed when I talk about my doggy. Best move to another topic. ^_^;
07,01Well...my cats just went to the litterbox...
It's a cat thing they know when you feel down.
http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/
i dont think ill be complete until i write infamare
and I'm more in the picture side of things than writing
/me giggles
SO MUCH SAD ;___;
06My cat would run across my keyboard
curently i have 3 cats naping on me.
Then get on with it Scar. :P
07,013?
07,01oh my!
07,01pic?
yes
07,01must see that!
Wow Sumica.
I have no drawing skills Kirz, writing's more my forté, as it were.
Ick. Wrong thing to do, Robin Williams.
i need to get the game again
i have to get it down to a tee
one is on my legs one is on my lap and one is on the back of the chare I am siting on across my sholders
07,01that's soooo cute!
07,01I just have one sleeping behind my monitor now
yeah but I want a drink and cant feel my legs
Did anypony here bid on that giant plushy?
07,01hahaha
down to the nitty gritty
even the scar
That's up to you.
Hehe. My kitty's ...somewhere. Hm. I should look for 'im.
I'll stick with what I know.
/me huggles herospirit
You~
07,01How many you have Critic?
woiw
AAAAAAAHHHHHHH
AHHHHHH
what is he doing?
hunting her?
Just the one. He keeps me busy enoug....oh, there he is.
He wants uppsies.
also, if anyone can find me a twilight sparkle version of cole, you get a shoutout
and this is how they had the idea of paranormal acticity
some how i think you could pay some one 5g to make a better rainbowdash.
...
now I'll have to make one >.<
06I love cats
07,01me too
06I love every kind of cat
/me felt the paws tapping his legs to ask for permission to get on his lap. xD
thanks
06I just want to hug all of them but I can't
06can't hug every cat. . .
I prefer dogs
Most cats try to claw me or eat my game system cables.
I like both.. I'd like a cat, but I have allergies to their dander..
AWWWW
hahaha

Hehe, and he wastes no time leaning up close and finding a comfy spot on my lap, haha. Good, I'll have a snugglebuddy to make it through the movie. :p
Sorry, I tend to hug a bit much. I'm clingy.
Yo dawg, I herd you liek paintings, so we put a painting in your painting so you can admire while you admire.
./hug luna

firing orbital friendship cannon
I would love so much to go to that place.
07,01this movie is good.. even in higher quality
Oy oy oy!
/me hugs Luna, laughs at Scar
Just to go there, stand, and admire the scenery and the landscape.
I own the Moon Fortress, I give clearance to fire those!

06Close Critic
06Iceland~

Heaven is new zealnd

(Mind you Clearance IS granted, but really now)
look closely, you'll see canterlot on that mountain o'er there
That works too.
06It oculd be either. . XD
07,01Well since this is the post show...
Eugh

Dancing on water...?
hehe, that's a good one
heaven is best zealand
D'aww :)
BTW Luna, despite me not being allowed to link stuff here, did you check the link I linked regardless?
Add New Zealand and Iceland to the places I wanna go.
New Zealand has too few tornadoes.
youre not allowed to link?
i am
(I reserve the right to relink it if you didn't)
07,01in the post-show you may link
Well, I was only allowed links related to the film at the time, according to Luna.
huh
/me is SO TIRED D8
... too few?
...so may I link? :P
07,01+ this is a silent room ;)

my bad
The combination of my two fanboyisms.
You need to sleep /*SOMETIME*/
07,01lol
It's FANTASTIC!
06Never! >~<
Dual Controls :3
Well isn't it? :P
ya it is
Viola could go lay down, but she wont fall alseep >.>
/me sings a lullaby for Viola
06Why do you say that Rainbow-Dash? >:
The fanfic for that one is actually quite good.
Cogito ergo sum
mfw I eat a pizza, then mother comes home with more food and I keep eating
the one posted recently?
Yup.
ah
it's on the big list of fanfics I still have to read >.<
But then, again I'm a relentless Robotnik-fanboy.
If heaven is conjured by the imagination...
I know how THAT is Kirz...
it keeps getting bigger 6_9
Yup.
I'd have the biggest server farm. xD
hey kirs quick question
This is an astoundingly productive fanbase.
... Can I make myself a pony?
Biggest LAN games ever.
07,01so where did this Robotnik fandom come from?
The Sonic games.
/me brohoofs Flaria
And Robotnik doesn't really have a fandom.
Yes.
Yes you can.
I'm just a fan of the character.
kirz were you serious when you said youd make me a picture?
/me thinks this heaven is best heaven.
/me brohoofs Flutterguy
might take a bit, but I put it on my list of pics to make
The main fanbase is the Sonic fanbase. But at least Robotnik is more than a paper cutout character, in my view.
yuuuurrr
Flaria, have massive LAN games of Quake, Doom, Battlefield, etc.
A while ago, a friend of mine challenged me to do a full raid and use ONLY Robotnik quotes whenever I had something to say.
Pulled it off too. Four hours. Wasn't easy. :P
Because you have to much energfy to fall asleep Viola
Flutterguy: I love you for saying DooM. <3
Energy*
07,01back in good old nax...
Only because Doom is amazing!
ok
07,01we had a GameMaster joining us
no Half-Life? ;_; *hit*
That happened in the earlier days of WoW Luna. Fun occurrences, usually :)
07,01yep
Half-Life too.
It was included under ect.
07,01and I loved the Safety dance
Ah. :P
Think I annoyed my GM with my Robotnik quotes...
robotnik is a pretty good character
Usually when he was explaining tactics.
"Enough of this nonsense!"
Yes Kirz. Yes he is.
has had a lot more development compared to most of the other characters
Flutterguy: Have you heard of Skulltag/ZDaemon?
Yyyup.
Heard of it, but I haven't actually looked into it.
but I used to read the comics, get more from those than the games alone
The Archie series?
yeah
Still read those.
Robotnik FINALLY got over having gone completely insane, rebuiilt the death egg, and pretty much WON.
v tec just kicked in.
Skulltag is DooM+, ZDaemon is DooM enhanced, ZDooM is like ZDaemon, but it's coming along better IMO
Have to admire that, no?
this will do nicely
Sounds pretty sweet!
haven't read the series since around issue 200 I think, but yeah, he gets around
Skulltag adds stuff like weapons and runes, ZDaemon and ZDooM just enhance the original DooM
Yeah, he goes mental in issue 200.
what film is this?
07,01Kirz
Takes him 25 issues to regain his mind. So a little over 2 years.
JC_Denton What Dreams May Come
*urgh*
?
What Dreams May Come
Dang. xD
:)
It's a beautiful movie
Ninja'd :D
pay attention, I've said I will be :p
It's very beautiful.
/me blushes
Be nice to Luna.
:D
/me hugs Luna.
07,01Sorry head full of ponies!
It will also make you B'AWWWWWWWW
i was just playing daggerfall
IDE, Internet Doom Explorer is my favourite DooM server browser, but ZDaemon and Skulltag have their own browsers
When... did I get here.
When did I log in. :I
When DID you get here herospirit?
herospirit: 'bout 10 minutes ago
:I
that is acceptable then :)
so much pony for a stream that has streamed 2 pony things today
Flutterguy: ZDaemon and Skulltag both have their own IRC servers, too.
is the lion king coming or did i miss that
Oh Hi hero
06Energy. . . x.x
And about 173289321069 pony emoticons.
You missed Lion King
That's pretty awesome
They do help.
07,01Well... i'm not watching the movie.. :)

I'm lagging a bit, so if I don't respond or speak or anything.. I'm lagging.

Luna's looking at stuff not inside the red box
Would you know that this does not come as a surprise Luna? :P
ill be quick doont start the suprise without me
07,01exactly
07,01How come your lagging?
No idea, internet's just been.. weird today.
Didn't we have the surprise already?
Time is an illiusion, lunch time doubly so.
07,01yep we did
07,01but I might be in the mood for some more nostalgia after this movie
please tell me it was recorded
07,01even better..
You re-streamed Lion King?
07,01it's on our playlist
Nittany_Tiger: Yep.
lol
...the singing?
Oh deary me.
I was driving home when it was playing.
07,01So bronies!
07,01How about some more Nostalgia after the movie?
Please?
ohh?
/me is running on energy drinks
More nostalgia?
Pwease woona?
yes please!
Yes pweese
I love nostalgia
what... kind of nostalgia?
07,01okidoki-loki!
Luna: What kind of nostalgia?
video games
Code Lyoko nostalgia?
this wouldn't happen to be something I could find online would it?
If by nostalgia you mean all of Samurai Jack
MY BODY IS READY
A Let's Play of Lion King?
My brother is using my PS3 and I'm doing work (slowly).
Samurai Jack was beastly.
07,01Just one samurai jack ep and more other stuff :)
If you would WANT to.
Nostalgiarific!
m bison yes

Tovler: I've been feeling like that ever since I started teaching high school kids in August.
07,01youtube.com/bronystate
No, he means the singing.
07,01well the second vid is the singing

07,01in the playlist
Hang about.
Dearest Princess Celestia
You taged me?
07,01no idea.. G+ anypony?
?
No thanks.
Sumica: First comment on newest EqD.
Mentioned rather than tagged, but I'm used to tagged.
I dont do first post.
06> mfw I hit 2 for her to switch to her pistol
ohhh
06BATTLEFIELD 3!!!! D<
Battlefield 3 was.. meh.

06Get out.
/me just got his dad's air rifle
No.
imma go hunt bunnies
best MP shooter is still UT2k4
though preferrably pigeons
,,
so what's G+?
pigeon tastes nicer
06I will agree with FreezeFrame.
07,01Google +
Google+, I assume.
BF3 certainly looks stunning. Haven't played though so can't say
Bugger, just a bit too slow.
06but Flutterguy, BF3 is gorgeous.
06CriticKitten get into the open beta ;3
It is.
ah, yeah, have that too
BF3 is indeed gorgeous.
BF3 looks interesting, but still not interested without Steam
06And we can go love each other <3
mfw my computer seems to hate BF3
Viola, origin name so we might play?
(This should really not come as a surprise :P)
07,01Feel free to add us: https://plus.google.com/111173542573917460290/posts
D'aww.
07,01I did see that :P
I've uploaded a massive one videos too.
Ghehe.
I'll need a better computer first. This thing....well, it sucks. :p
Hey, does anyone here use the PS# and have BF3 beta? we can play :D
PS3 *
LordCelestia, I have you added, remember? :)
how long till this movie finish
It's a long one
07,01an hour
Oh, youre superhero right?
Wait, is that a girl?
or something?
I am.
Anyone else? we can all play or something. PS3 names
....d'aw. Kitty asked for shoulder time. xD
My PS3 is broken
(he likes to perch his little rump on my shoulder for some reason)
06Awwww~
This movie is depressing me a bit, but I don't wanna stop watching it! ;_;
Derpy. xD
Derpy!
By the way, speaking for Robotnik Corp, Equestria has been officially whitelisted on the "worlds not to conquer" list.
when I gro up I wanna be asain
Sumica: xD
lol
Besides, that list is a bit pointless while that hyperannoying hedgehog still lives...
so which exit off of the multiverse highway would equestria be?
Why wait?
*kicks to moon*
i'm not entirely certain.
07,01it's ponyverse!
/me kicks Sumica to Asain Land
XD
07,01ponynet & ponyweb
So hard to type with kitty on shoulder....
I have high hopes for my HA Missile though.
(Hedgehog Annihilator)
Coax kitty off of your shoulder?
*Sir, launch failure. The missile detonated inside the silo. The setback will last for months!*
Yes, that was a scar on her wrist.
...bugger.
Naw, he's comfy. I'll let him sit until he wants to get down.
blame uncle chuck
I'm well past that.
He hasn't been part of the Eggman Empire for years.
I can't rule out sabotage, of course.
cat owners will almost never displace a kitty
(incidentally, if we're going by the actual Archie Canon here Kirz, I'm sitting on board the Death Egg II, having won)
(more or less)
won't last :p
Highly likely.
07,01Can I borrow somepony to test something?
But allow me my illusions, would you?
sure
Sure Luna.
can someone fill me in on the plot?
Damnit, i wanted to be of help.
:P
lol
everyone's dead
Octavia's plot is best plot?
I would post a pic, but it seems.. inappropriate.
Sumica right?
*facepalm* nt what i ment
ok then yeah every one is dead.
Done. :)
Going to bed. Bye everypony
Night Rainbow-Dash
Bye RD!
Bye Dashie
There, he's down now. Flopped in lap. :p
07,01thanks
And Kirz, replied to you on the wall :P
07,01what wall :o
Also, this movie is dark. ._.
The main channel comments Luna.
(I.e. the comments on the main DA page)
07,01ah yes.. thanks both!
It's depressing, but it's still romantic
So wait, what happens if you're aware you're breaking the order of things but commit suicide anyways?
Not so much dark as.. deep.
lol, yeah, reverse order between the 2 spots
Ghehe.
Happy to assist Luna. :)
*cue gurren dan motto*
07,01I needed to make sure people were able to reply on it
Ahh.
I suppose that's true, Flutterguy. Just....wow. o.o
Right, where was I?
Oh yes, cackling maniacally on board the Death Egg II.
MWAHAHAHAHAAAA!
lol
people flying
ITS HOGWARTS!
Hogwarts in heaven?
WANT
I wonder if she'll stay dead this time.
im back'
she's been dead a few times already
what did i miss?
Welcome back.
Now all we need is Quidditch, butterbeer, and the Whomping Willow.
Nah, only once Kirz.
Flutterguy: Best LAN party is Hogwarts LAN party
Then Sonic 'died' and returned.
XD
any ground breaking plot twists?
So did Knuckles, who ACTUALLY died and returned.
Seriously, the Archie canon needs help. :P
and then dropped his transcendant form
Ah yes.
He regains that though.
Then there's Shadow.
Hogwarts LAN party with the characters(not the actors) is better LAN party Flaria :P
test tube hedgehog
Who probably died 2000 times by cutting his own wrists and rapidly healing.
(Me? Dislike Shadow? Whatever gives you THAT idea?)
The voice of Skyrim again!
lol
DOVAKLEEN
Depends on how long they've played video games, Flutterguy. xD
MARIAAAA!
im dom from gears of war!
FUS RO DAH
cant wait
HURRY UP NOVEMBER. GAWD.
and im also an anthropomorphic hedgehog
"Hi, I'm grim, gritty, completely one dimensional, and rather more angsty than should ever be allowed"
Easy kills Flaria, easy kills XD
11.11.11
Flutterguy: True that xD
Ever played Shadow the Hedgehog? Yes, he had a game.
It was basically Sonic. With guns.
"i also have a counterpart named shadow
How do I shot rocket? *dead*
And vehicle sections.
oho see what i did there?
Shadow can break the SOUND BARRIER while RUNNING!
that was a bad game
Why the hell does he need a motor cycle!?
111111
goes with the black leather jacket
one of the good endings he takes over the universe
11.1.11 is the date I'm waiting for MrChang.
He doesn't have a black leather jacket.
He does Scar?
Neat.
he does now
im waiting for 10/25
its a GOOD ending though
because I'm on the internet and said so
/me hugs FlutterBro13
Welcome back!
I hate Shadow the Hedgehog even more for another thing.
That's a maybe.
Hey FlutterBro
Robotnik actually DIES in a variety of the endings.
Hi FlutterBro
>mfw I care less about ep 3 than ep 4
DEMENTORS
yup
which is dumb
How they managed to reconcile all the bloody plot threads is beyond me...
because there is only one
And as with all the other Sonic games in recent history:
all the other ones arent real
The Voice Acting was SHIT. Except Robotnik's.
only the true ending is the real ending
>mfw I care so much about ALL of the episodes.
Ah.
Really hopes this is what its like when he dies
they play off all of the games as non-canon
everything else is a false plot twists
"Enough of this nonsense! The Chaos Emeralds belong to ME! All of them! Now move aside, or I WILL crush you!"
....
07,01holy hell...
What.
This is now trippy.
As opposed to Shadow:
funny luna
fact sonic heroes was the sequel to shadow the hedgehog
Everypony! Stop CONSUMING SHROOMS.
Okay, how is that not hell?!?
shadow the hedgehog was the sequal to SA2
"Where's that DAMN chaos Emerald?" "Damn" "Damn!" "damn..."
sonic adventure 2 sequel to sonic adventure
And how often can one character get amnesia!?
Seriously.
well hell never remember that he did
After the third time, you'd think Shadow would take a moment to write a goddamned DIARY.
i wish i was good looking enough to have an attractive girlfriend ;(
but he forgot he forgot
Well, I wasn't expecting that F-Bomb at all
except he can't remember that he's had amnesia
lol
ummm
Oh my
Woona whut do
Yeah, but he also remembers the times he forgot.
he was a good man what a rotten way to die
So no, he's full of it.
WHATS GOING ON?
And thick.
Very, very thick.
heres the explanation
MARIA!
Thanks for that.
DOM we gotta kill some locusts!
07,01Hmm?
"Now to input the password... MA-RI-A. Maria!"
but i have to find the chaos emeralds to save maria
hi there u guiz
I still wonder where Robotnik found a keyboard using two-lettered keys.
Hey Cupcake

Thunder_Dash lol
BTW, who here played Sonic 2006?
Flutterguy: It's only 10:21 xD
taboo!
a slap in the face!
was that sonic 4?
And if yes, did you or did you not contemplate suicide?
No, Sonic 4 was 2010. :P
Oh.. ._.
i did
Actually Scar, Sonic 2006 has two saving graces.
werewolf sonic?
Nah, that's 2009.
2006 was just an atrocity.
Yeah. 10:21 and yet I still feel kinda out of it. :/
king arthur sonic?
I go to sleep around midnight but I get tired early...
what could possibly save that abomination?
But with, as said, two saving graces.
its 3:22 here
One:
am
Robotnik at least did reasonably well.
8:22 P.<. here
3FlutterBro13!
P.M.
7:22PM herew (PST)
*here
3Wo bist du?
His plots were mental, but that's the story board going completely off the record. At least he pulled his role off.
10:22 here
Two:
He rebuilt Sonic Adventure's Egg Carrier!
07,01he's Fluttershy's brother
they have interspecies romance!
That ship was bloody AWESOME!
that cancels out any saving graces!
How do I made sandvich?
Noted.
BUT!
Luna
The Egg Carrier is awesome.
07,01yessems?
I haven't a clue
Wo means where
3Wo=Where
interspecies!
3Wer=Who
That TF2 flash was amazing LC
EGG CARRIER!
It appeared first in Sonic Adventure.
It was
Which didn't feature that problem.
EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE GAME!
teaspoon of bologna~!
Ick. Flashback to that scene? Please no. ._.
That did NOT just happen!
Nah, Sonic Adventure wasn't that bad.
A THIRD AND FOURTH HEDGEHOG!
Child funeral, ick. ;_;
You're still on about 2006 then?
YES!
Hang on, who's the fourth?
lol
Oh, Mephiles.
What happened to his son?
The story of that game was an enormous clusterfuck.
Seriously.
Son and daughter both died in a car wreck at a young age.
I've played it through, and I can't make heads nor tails of most of it.
and then mephiles turned into a mutation of the final boss of SA2
Hit by a truck.
;_______;
They like trains
Huh.. then what was that they just showed? An alternate timeline?
/me can't imagine anything more horrific than going to a kid's funeral.
rawr
What, the Biolizard?
^
Flutterguy: Flashback
How does THAT work!?
So many flashbacks
they look kinda similar
im goin top play BF3
And did I miss that part?
flashception
That, or I blocked it out.
Bye then LC!
you didnt see the final boss?
07,01k baabai!
Like I said, that entire story was a gargantuan clusterfuck.
its a clone of SA2s
We need flashbacks within flashbacks :l
Nope, don't think so.
Going to your classmate's funeral when he died one block away while you slept completely undisturbed.
And that's sad.
Seeya LordCelestia
he goes super say- i mean super sonic
Flashbackception Flaria!
lol
Mind you, SOnic Adventure did start one bad trend.
and then flies up and hits the weak point
/me brohoofs Flutterguy
A non-Robotnik final boss. :(
Chaos was fine as the final boss.
Freeze: Been there (twice). That's pretty high up there, but I imagine if your kid died before you, it'd be even worse.
But then in SA2 you had the Biolizard.
In Heroes you had Metal Sonic.
biolizard was actually pretty cool though
Oh certainly.
I'd never be able to handle that.
metal sonic has always been a good fight
Having to attend your kid's funeral would be much worse.
Then Unleashed had that "dark gaia" thing.
do a reality check everyone
Yeah, if only Sonic heroes weren't a bad game Kirz. :P
07,01So... do you guys play left4dead?
i do
/me pats CriticKitten on the back again
Lunaaaa.
i have l4d2
07,01yay
I'm in the middle of a rant!
lol
/me giggles
/me sniffles.
I've tried it, but zombie games aren't my favorite
07,01so much ranting!
Well, to reply to the final point then - Scar, I liked the Biolizard as final boss, certainly. But sadly, the trend was set. Robotnik hasn't been a final boss until Sonic Colours.
(that was a fun final fight, that one)
You know I used to turn my tv on for sound in the room. till I started coming here.
true
metal sonic from sonic 2 was a pain
God yes. :p
Harder than the Robotnik armour after it. :p
Mmm, I wonder what Cuba has been doing recently...
"let's put a boss in the zone, no rings, not save, and one tiny, tiny little weak point"
07,01interesting quit message..
Ponies will fill my apartment at school. Nuff said.
i wish this place will stream more often
Luna ikr?
'swhy I get squirmy with child funerals. So awful.
i liked the super sonic part of the biolizard, but i could never figure out how i won it
Yip :P
I know what you mean there Scar.
i just kinda....did it
07,01Well we stream during the week too
It did feel a bit like "uhh, so I charge now?"
I can only imagine
we stream HOUSE MD
JC there are occasional streamers throughout the weekdays.
I can't even imagine how that'd feel. XP
But Sonic Adventure 2 deserves enormous praise for this:
07,01and Dr Who
And hope I never have to.
Since my current plans include a childless marriage (I'm indifferent, my long-term gf who I'm 99% likely to marry doesn't want them)
when and what gets streamed during the week?
07,01and Nostalgia content
Robotnik had possibly his best showing in the entire sonic series there. he was playable. And awesome.
I LOVE DOCTOR WHO!
If you stream Ed, Ed, n Eddy I will LOVE AND TOLERATE you
Luna: You gonna stream new Haus?
that reminds me I need to get a dvd player set up here so i can stream Stargate.
07,01once I have it, I will :)
you know the vs mode?
Yup.
Didn't play it much.
No TV streaming capability?
did you think dark chao was broken as shit?
Never had a second Dreamcast controller :P
its on gamecube dude
/me hugs Sumica
chrono trigger battle theme
but anyway
That one wasn't part of the ORIGINAL Dreamcast release.
07,01the new House is not airing here (yet)
Yay House. That'll be a good break from the sad stuff this weekend. XD
I think I am the only one with a capture card.
Sonic Adventure DX was a port from the Dreamcast mate :P
it was only in the gamecube version?
So was Sonic Adventure 2 Battle.
Yup.
New Haus is tomorrow night.
07,01GGgala too
huh
i already saw the new house ep
Chaos and Tikal weren't there either.
well dark chao can 2 shot
but house is on when I work so no luck
really?
Yup.
woow
i prefer the port
an unfinished version
Well, they just added a few features.
I don't.
Some of the added features were bugs.
Quite a lot of them, in fact.
does easyCap count as a capture card? >_>
could you still glitch out of the normal and dark chao gardens in the dreamcast version?
07,01yep
Probably. never tried.
i know you can in the gamecube version
I want a capture card :<
Though they redesigned the Dark Chao garden in the GC version.
oh right sorry forgot GG has one too.
Good bye Bronystate.
07,01Goodnight Kalisia
later Kalisia
._.
Bye, Kalisia
did they have blood instead of water in the dreamcast version?
Bye Kalisia
/me hugs Kalisia
How is this not hell again?
Hah, not quite grim enough for that. :P
But they did change chao mechanics around a fair bit.
they did in GC
This is just.. freaky.
The base game remains the same though.
One thing that always irritated me about Sonic Adventure 2 though:
they will come here....one day. *Evil laugh*
"There's no punishment or judgment". I call horseshit on that, sir!
Robotnik suddenly adopting the name "Eggman".
Horse manure*
hes got the maassta plan
And hers is the only face in that entire field that isn't a greyish color
He treats it as a nasty insult in Sonic Adventure 1, and then suddenly he takes the name?
The idea is that the only torment your soul goes through is that which it inflicts on itself.
you do know the story on that right?
Pony fecal matter*
Yes, the song was bloody fantastic.
Yes, I know Kirz.
:p
07,01Oooh this is the point where I got naughty right..?
I don't care if it was Eggman in Japan first.
I grew up with Robotnik. :P
no, not that
/me giggles
I think so. xD
Oh luna~
Um, Luna, what are yo- o.o
/me huggles Luna
Then what?
Flutterguy: <3
/me hugs everypony
forget when exactly, but the original universe robotnik was destroyed in some dimensional/explosion/something
Someone needs to make that Twilight-slowly-coming-closer vid with Luna, now. :p
Oh that.
Yes, but we're talking game canon now.
/me hugs Luna back. xD
I'm on it!
^
XD
Most of the Archie storyline has precious little to do with the games.
/me glomps CriticKitten "FUND IT"
Luna? Be naughty? Better get MoonDasher
Even though I'll probably have crap editing skills.
/me kicks MoonDasher "WRONG CHANNEL!"
oh! i just remembered! i have a horse riding lesson tomorrow!
i remember the last sonic comic i read
:o
Awesome.
with the sa games they pulled more from the comics didn't they?
mib_svcycf I heard someone say Naughty Luna
Flutterguy: once
:p
the green guy from sonic riders beat up sonic and then i burned it up
I know, MoonDasher, I know
SILVER :o
when i was an itty bitty twinkie pinkie
never have, never will :(
Oh hi silvermane.
hai
hi *
/me waves at Bronystate
Night guys
yes! that is a fantastic idea!
Ohai Silvermane
/me hugs Silvermane
/me hugs Flaria
ah
I heard that guy talk ONCE in Sonic Riders.
Hello~
/me waves at Revolver
Hi Silvermane, bye Flaschn
/me brohugs Silvermane
hey Thunder_Dash
one day, i shall own a horse
/me brohugs(?) MoonDasher
:)
hehe
i shall call her Rainbow Dash
Some things should really not be allowed.
bro hug. A manly hug
>.>
then i can ride rainbow dash
why does sonic need a board?
or a car?
/me hugs Silvermane
and life shall be awesome
he can run faster than a rocket car
Well, they explained away the car.
he did it in the show
you need to paint it first
how did they explain it?
"It wouldn't exactly be fair to have Sonic running in a fair race"
Rainbow Dash? Silly pony, that's not how you spell Twilight Sparkle!
oh bullshit
Yes yes, Sonic R did that.
although... with enough generations of selective breeding and pelt alterations...
thats not an explanation
you can get COLORED HORSES
At least they made the effort :P
You all have such a weird way of spelling Rarity.
MoonDasher, with the hearty back slapping?
And Robotnik is FANTASTIC in Sonic & Sega All-Stars.
/me does not get a hug in return from Silvermane?
my Kindle is already called Twilight Sparkle
He takes his mini-flier.
if they attached like a colar that explodes if he breaks the rules, then i could see it
It's FFVII ALL OVER AGAIN
it would get confusing
/me sobs on the moon
And converts it into a bloody monster truck.
oh FreezeFrame, that's not how you spell Fluttershy
*win*
Man, am I the only one who can spell Applejack right?
(trollface) twilight gritter
wiw
wow
/me hugs Luna
/me did not see Luna's hug due to not wearing glasses
biwinning
I called my Nook "Yomiko"
/me is banished to the moon where he has nothing to do but hug Luna
/me is content with this new life
/me hugs Silvermane
/me hugs Luna "ILU"

"Thanks, Luna! What do you do up here?"
and a load of bananas?
(here's to hoping that link works. It won't load for me blast it :P)
*facehoof*
I don't get to go to the moon?
hold on
ive gotta get new pants
Ah, it did work for you then? P
/me smiles and says: "Watching bronies. What brings you here?"
yep
*power kicks Revolver to the moon* why wait?
/me nods, thinking. "Well, I did something stupid, so I got sent here. I forgot to hug you."
I'm sorry, but that's bloody awesome.
I suspect Scar agreed.
/me lands on the moon
soo coool
07,01"You are forgiven Silvermane"
Hey Silvermane, hey Luna
"Hooray! Hug?"
/me hugs both
:P
07,01"What brings you here Revolver?"
/me hugs Luna and Revolver. It is a very manly hug.
Completed the entire game as Robotnik. :P
Was pretty much a given when I bought it.
"I got powerkicked here."

>_>
<_<
/me gazes at the moon with his telescope
Put it this way: If you like Mario Kart, you'll most likely like Sonic & Sega All-Stars racing. It's essentially just a well-executed clone.
/me squeaks! "Gently please!"
/me moons Dumori
/me flies to the moon, lands and hugs Luna
i hated mario kart
its luck based
/me launches himself to the moon
lol, nope :p
there is very little skill
/me giggles at Luna's Rarity quote, hearing it in her voice.
/me feels like flying to the moon but..
/me suspects there's about to be a party on the moon.
Well, Sonic & Sega All-Stars has one very big plus over Mario Kart.
hey that is cheating Flaria
No. Blue. Shell.
no power ups?
I want to go to the moon too. D:
no blue shells?
lol
oh hell yes
shall I brake out the song
/me turns on the disco ball on the moon.
/me wonders how a brony can fly up so high!
There IS an ultimate move.
But it helps the one who uses it.
/me boogies down.
what is it?
So if I'm in 8th and pick up an all-star move, I get the boost.
The magic of friendship, Luna!
Rather than nuking the nr. 1 for no real reason.
/me giggles
Varies per racer.
oh ok
Sumica, I have fire.
so it doesnt screw everyone else over
/me turns the entire moon into a great big disco ball!
I am my own jetpack.
it helps just you
Robotnik transforms his monster truck into his flight form. Equipped with cluster missiles.
No air in space means no fire Flaria.
/me builds pony pyramid to reach moon.
/me licks Flaria
*trollface*
uhhh
Oh, it screws over those near you. :P
what?
06What have I trotted into?
06o.o
but fire needs air.
Flutterguy: Doesn't matter if I reach velocity before exiting space :3
Viola #bronystate?
07,01A party!
LUNA! :D
the correct velocity*
/me glomps Luna
07,01Even better
07,01A party on the Moon!
/me hugs everypony. "Shame I forgot to put on pants first!"
/me teleports to the moon even though he is a pegasus.
/me gets a unicorn to teleport him to the moon.
problem with hight speed there Flaria
Moon party now?
06Am I invited to this party?
06o:
07,01Indeed you are
It's a lot easier to say Celestia banish physics and just do it.
:3
what up faaaaam were dead so it doesnt matter if i teleport through space and time
yay party. :3
stoping is and issue when in space.
:P
/me gets to shufflin'.
But yeah, basically you just get a speed boost and a special ability tailored to your character.
/me begins dancing with herself~
/me hugs Luna very tight. "If you are ever in need of shipping, you know where to go." He kisses her noisily on the cheek.
Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to go super.
Erryday I'm Discordin'
So does Shadow, unsurprisingly.
in a car?
/me overheard Silvers comment
a car?!
:o
/me giggles and blushes even more
yeah, he loses the car for the duration.
Try not to ask.
WHAT?!
/me is a fillies-colt
its not fair for sonic to run
/me joins Viola's dance
but he can run
Fly, technically.
Everybody do the time warp... again....
Amy just speeds up and busts out her hammer.
/me joins as well, since there are fillies. and he is a single-minded pony
damn magic ponies be havven all the fun.
Knuckles uses the Master Emerald to power up and use a powerful ground slam.
Bitch to have used against you.
/me is a pegasus)
thats not how the master emerald works
then there're characters from other famous Sega franchises.
Just watch out for the whalers up there.
/me dances with Luna~
Ryo Hazuki, from Shenmue.
it is not how it works!
AAAH
Ever play that?
nope
/me dances with Viola and Luna
yeah you also got punted up there.
Moving on then.
07,01"Well, Viola is a earth pony and she got up here too.. Why can't you? "
do they have mike thorton from alpha protocol?
/me gets crazy
Well, frankly, all the characters I really know in the game are the Sonic ones. :P
Nope.
aww
They're whalers on the moon, they carry their harpoons, but their ain't no whales so they tell tall tales and sing their hearty tune
Crazy Taxi is featured.
Space Channel Five.
his special would be a tranq gun
^
Alex Kidd, for some reason.
She knows the back door? *shrug*
:(
or maybe duel smgs
The Zombies from House of the Dead.
Sad movie is being sad.
/me teleports all remaining ponies to the moon using his shipping powers.
/me searched though his libary for a spell that will let him "too the moon"
And a couple more.
/me hates whalers with a fiery passion
I'll stick with Robotnik's cluster missiles.
My favourite part.
06. . .
Dumori, go to LordCelestia's castle. he'll show you how to get to the moon.
In the middle of his all-star move, he announces, calm as anything:
what is on stream anyways?
would that be shipping to the moon then?
"Now, allow me to introduce you to my latest creation."
/me will destroy all whalers.
yes Sumica, yes it would
I'd rather babel to controll it
fighter jet
you babel things?

/me licks Luna on the cheek then Glomps Viola. "FOR NO RAISON!"

/me giggles, "llwat?"

/me smacks Silvermane around "KEEP IT TOGETHER MAN!"
"damnit"
"I mean, oh good."
07,01that "yet"
Flutterguy: This
"Wouldnt want that would we"
/me picks up MoonDasher by the collar. "So transparent."
Nightmares dont last forever
oh Luna, you know you'd love to star in one of the infamous Silver-Shipping stories
lol, that's one on the list
nah
she probably wouldn't
06Eenope? o:

I dread to think of what's next from Silvermane. Like a TwilightxManticore fic..

Viola, who would you like?
Silvermane: That's not how you Scoota-Eww
Silvermane, I don't wear a collar.
Nope.
He was complaining about bleeding ears, as I recall.
Isn't Trixie x Hat x Cape already canon?
yes it is
And I think that one's on my reading list.
I keep throwing my cash at the screen but no fics of Trixie x Hat x Cape are being made!

Yfw I randomly have a street sharks vulgar

Luna: even? those shows were actually good

Wow, those cops are almost as incompetent as the ones in Ace Attorney
deliopen: guys that got mutated into half sharks half men via gene therapy that allows them to swim through the earth and make terrible one liners

load them in what, you jut burryed them.
Heh, not really.
Just hammering in the point a tad.
Lol, I get what this is...
it's funny because these sharks barely have any teeth
...it's a bad TMNT knockoff.
yeah
Amusingly bad though.
we all know
Which is why it's hilarious
lets go over there and throw a ferris wheel at him
we are watching for the lulz
not the how god it is

It appears I forgot to autojoin.
Oh hi
Did I miss anything good?
Hai.
only Street Sharks
It was so jawesome
not the word i would use.
no no
it fits
seeing as it's the shows catchword
admitedly the first ep
wasn't as god as the rest of the show
was epicly slow
needed more eating random things
So you all looking forward to luna in the halloween ep?
Oh GOD YES
way to much tbh
What? Halloween? I thought it was just for Luna.
Luna <3, I feel bad for the moon thing now.
it seems to hint at pony halloween in the synopis
what it being Nightmare night
or such
Meh. Just Luna would be better.
Synopsis: It's Nightmare Night and the macabre celebrations are in full swing when Luna herself shows up in Ponyville, determined to change her frightening public image.
ta-dar
>macabre celebrations
Dammit.
candy ponys
seems the plot will still revlove around her even if it's themed
macbre
...
yeah
sure
Stupid Luna nostailger streams
they are mopre appealing than most invites out I get
that and nights out suck hard being broke
wait sut?
nah I just got asked if I want to think a club I like tonight
simple ansues is nope Luna's streaming Danger Mouse and Samurai Jack
oh oki

For a second i thought we started RP and i was like wait I need my hat and cape.

that is temping
actually they've swaped the Monday night club line up
still looks like I'd have to room swap a fair bit all 3 dj's are lookign to play shit soem of the time
still ska-punk on the line up that's a rare choice these days
still I can't belive its one of the best alternaive clubs in the UK
it isn't that good IMHO
I like that cornor shot with the shot gun
hehe
it also won best night club at least two years running
maybe I'm spoiled by it being so close
lotoa cops

and I'll feel ill and hurt all over
stupid training
i work at a nursing home so throwing up or diareah and it's straight home
any way hope you feel better soon ctrlx
I can guess
I know in some places its two days after you stop feeling ill you can go back to working in high risk places
yah it's just our infection control policy
it makes sense
but it must be a bummer if you don't get sick pay while off
wb ctrlx
lol dc
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaPEr1Mg2i0&NR=1&feature=fvwp
guess I should get back to training soon

Hi Fluttershy`
08,01dohoho
08,01I returneth
08,01hiya
hey hey hey Fluttershy`
I need more pony music
I only have a few 100 tracks
at best
likely 100 tops
/me needs more pony music too
07,01but some of it is crap..
true
but I'm sure there are more good tracks I'm missing
in fact I'm almost sure
08,01I RETURNETH TRIUMPHANT
08,01lol mIRC is awesome
07,01eeeeyup
/me is using a black background with point 9 calibri text
08,01point 9? >> I just mean.. 9
08,01lol
08,01thinking in led
07,01As long as you do not use comic sans...
08,01uuughh no
08,01not papyrus either lol
08,01or fixedsys
08,01XD
D: comics sans
I really should mIRC
but right now I like my bastard child of an IRC client
08,01what are you using?
a mostly self coded
hack based of the very limited IRC support in .libpurple
it has b
bugs
08,01oooh it's like what flutterbro13 made in Java...
it's a bit fuggly but UI and code wise
yeah but in C
well C++
but I think a few plug in might be in C
08,01flutterbro knows... java, c, c++, c#, ruby and some other obscure programing languages I know
wait... libpurple
it's a real mess
Doesn't pidgin run on that?
yeah
it's basicly self hacked pidgin plugins
08,01he's a friggin' programming genius... he made a whole game engine from scratch
but I have a pidgin less .exe some place
08,01he scares me with how much he knows >_<
my programing is admitedly rusty
but I'm not bad
I take it pidgin has no built-in irc support?
it dose
it's just bad
:P
to make a game engine from scratch.. you must first invent the universe
I'll stick with SSH + Screen + Irssi
there are a few open source plugisn that make it better
so I took those hack thme to bits
08,01MeteorVenture I don't know exactly how he made it of course.... but I saw the result
russeled up some more stuff
08,01and the result was awesome XD
3d or 2d?
lol alright
2d I've done a few times
3d I get pissed at as I try and make good modern 3d and it's soo hard to code for
2d is way simpler
that and I get lazy and diftracted easy
3d has that annoying Z-vector
yeah
and all that drawing the 3d too
ugh
then AI is way more fun to code
08,01I'll have to get him to show some of his stuff...
simpley put I get so easly side tracked form any thing
I don't like coding frontend stuff
I like doing more backend things
I think I'm the same
Diftraku:
UI and GUI's aren't fun
just tedious
Very
I can do frontend if needed
I can design them fine
I just hate coding them
after thaty
Same
/me missed his code monkey job
:(
/me has never coded for work
it's so so x3
I self-learnt PHP even :P
I've had two coding jobs
one freelance one as a code monkey
freelance was bam heres a brife cod it ALL
code monkey was mostly the other porgramers spoting my eye for detail ans slaping me in debugging
half the fucks didn't even coment
lol
hell one guy sent me a mess of go-tos
lmao
with no coments of documentaion
I just recoded it
VB?
not sure now
Or basic
Both had gotos
a few others do too
C and C++ do
it's not bad if used right IMHO
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU
but these days object based porgraming removes any "good" use 90% of the time
Yeah, _if_ you use it right
10Obligatory post, since there are people talking about coding
:P
it;s use full in say loops if you need to recur in an odd way
I just use foreach/for and break when needed
If I need to recursively go through an array I can use internal classes for that
Got to love PHP :3
:D
php not much knowledge of tbh
any more
it's all faded to the back ofmy huge memeory vault
http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chatroulette-trolling-and-thats-why-i-could-not-finish-my-homework.jpg
I've made bots for web games with it before ect
:P
I had a bot for Fallensword
It went through the whole map by first downloading the map from the server
Parsing which blocks were passable and which were impassable
(Caching these results of course :P)
I had a team of them for a web based clan v clan turn based game
Then it would systematically go through the whole map and kill everymob on it
I basicly just made a clan of bots
what hella funny
perfect timeing in a turn based MMO
can;t beat it
Yeah :P
It helps I was able to rip most of siad MMO's code
and use it to make a master client
lol
I was a massive black hat in my early teens
I made Runescape my bitch a few times
Haven't really hacked anything
including ripping all of it's code and data
and making a free auto updating clone sever net work
and adding a new line or two for the death messages
At one point, I knew how WoW logs on to a server
From start to finish
so every now and then it says more than "Oh dear you have died"
Starting with the handshake and challenge
and abuses you for dieing
:P
Best part of the first Runesacpe hack
the soical part
I hit a huge road block a ceritan error when it tryed to update, so I worked out what was cuasing it and worked out if a legit client could ever get it
they could so I got support ot fix it golbaly for me, allowing my hack to work
lol
yup
I'm glad I stoped hacking when I did though
it's got a quite nasty secen in places
with major organised crime groups hopping in. I'd rather not cross such types I value my limbs and such
Yeah
I whent white hat at the end
stoping fraud groups, CP rings ect
but I dropped out after a member of our littel group got some heavy IRL pressure put on him
I think most of us did (at least lay low for a bit after that(
No wonder
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLwPQcai0F8&hd=1
The fug am I watching
ugh my rus is none existant
I have to say I've had a fun 19 years of life
10What was it that made you go whitehat in the end?
the challenge
10Understandable
soem of the pople I was up agaist where as good as me if not better and didn't want to get caught
that and the slightly more legal side of it
and I guess some moral prangs at just random romping round the internet
ANy way time to write steam/electropunk horror seeds for my upcoming RPG game
I'm hoping to run soon
10Fancy :P
It's only an Unhallowed Metropilse game
Hey RBD
10Ohai
10Ahhh that makes sense :D
10How you been doing buddy?
Good
Not getting as much sleep as I should though
Thanks to Flaria I'm hooked on romance novels again.
10xD
10My sleep has been a little wonky for my first week of uni, so much drinking D:
I read through an entire book at work (I have problems.)
Gotta love 3G
Mad ups to the portable internet.
Hey.
07,01hey

Hi Darius

Hah, been a while since I've seen that show.

07,01Oh and I saved some Mr Bean for later tonight :)
rowan atkinson =D
07,01oui

You beat me to it
Lucy in the sky with LSD
Hey guys. Look http://www.ebay.com/itm/My-Little-Pony-Friendship-Magic-Rainbow-Dash-Handmade-Plush-/150667913782?_trksid=p4340.m1374&_trkparms=algo%3DPI.WATCH%26its%3DC%252BS%26itu%3DUCC%26otn%3D15%26ps%3D63%26clkid%3D3217869397637698714
will you still love me? will you still have me? when i'm 64
look at the price...
Damn.
300$+
A lot of money.
.____.
Thats a pretty good price on one of that quality though.
it looks good but i would not pay that much for it
I would buy it if I had the money
28 bids
yeah me too
i'd buy it if it wus fluttershy
the life size one highest bid is $4000?
I'll buy it at a high price.
Hasbro Y U NO make plushies?
close to
if not over by now DashWithRainbows
if only i had the money to buy one :(
$4002 to be exact
300 dollars is nothing though http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=170703151061
It works out at over a grand a week for makign one
being geniorus with the manhours
and assuming a full time job of making it
Rainbow-Dash thats what im talking about already xD
they howry shieeeeeet
4000$
the other one looks better IMO
the smaller cheaper one looks better imo
the other one isn't 4 feet tall
but yeah 4 foot smaller one would be the shit
yeah but its alot cheaper
But the real question is: Will it blend?
yeah
if you got the right blender
It would blend in my room quite nicely Veewave
only have a few wired s in the legs
from 105$ to 4002?
DashWithRainbows. Dont even think of doing something like that
that guy will be rich xD
yeah
asuming they maded it as a full tiem job and it took 120 hours ot make
that's a grand a week
i would laugh if the next day, hasbro now releasing life size pony plushies!! for $100!
I can see life sized main 6 poping up soon enought
the guy who bought it would be pissed.
really would you turn down that money
strange when fanmade stuff is more appealing than the official stuff
yep
even assuming a price dro
if hasbro made official ones that looked anywhere the sort of quality of these fan ones id buy em
same^
btw 4000$ are a little too much
i think
agreed
if they sold ponies in more franchises in the UK that would be good
Ponynomics^
yeah, uk is pretty dry when it comes to pony merch
if i do want something, i have to pay ridiculus shipping prices
same here
u should see belgium... the toys are here but not the show
lucky^
same here in italy :D
brofist?
*Brohoof
even better
dat correct term
i want to the toystore to look at the toys
i swear i wish a clerk came talk to me
I think toy R us stocks them UK
but I'm not going that far for pony
the blind bags i think Dumorimasoddaa
plus I'm too broke
but its rare to find one that stocks them
honestly the decorations around the toys looked better than the toys themselves
Tesco = sponsers MLP:FiM so they might sell the toys?
x3
but my dad works in the local tescos
yeah i can imagine the akwardness of me going into toys r us and asking about the mlp fim toys
awrkward buying that would be
Kdude i wouldnt care about the awkardness
Kdude I'd do it
how ever buying them form the shop your father works
i didn't find any good one to get that far
prepare to squeee!
thats a whole different kettle of fish.

hmmm

D'AAAWWW

hi allis
hey AllisZero
http://www.ebay.com/itm/Pinkie-Pie-Custom-Handmade-Plush-My-Little-Pony-Friendship-is-Magic/270826208862?ssPageName=WDVW&rd=1&ih=017&category=230&cmd=ViewItem
i think looks pretty good
not bad price either
same guy
i know
i dont have that kind of cash to throw at expensive plushies unfortunately
I need money I can sew
^
Euro plushies quick cash in on this craze
i bought 3 games this month and i have a con later this month
x3
so i really need to save a bit X3
I own $7
£7*
saving money up for FushiCon in november = spare cash will go towards buying halo anniversary
I'm so rich its mad
saving up for Unhallowed Met Revised and 40kRPG: Black Crusade
my bank account has 7000 euro. mom's even counting on me to have backup money in case something goes wrong
tesco sells some of the MLP:FiM toys...
im checking their website now
My account has $130 and decreasing fast.
Family takes up all of my salary and it still isn't enough
Shitty times I say
i'm nigh on broke and I waiting on welfare money so I can eat decent food.
i can never find any stores that sell MLP:FiM bedsheets
mom asks 250 euro to cover my room and food
a month?
i really am lucky for being mentally disabled
yup
I couldn't use FiM bed sheets
Heh, I pay $900 for living expenses at home, but actually chip in about $2000
I shoudl file for disability
i wish hasbro would just make some standard accurate-to-the-show pony models so i would have something to put on my desk :(
I doubt I'd hold a none fexable job with them
i got it years ago. went to a school that drove me nuts
some weeks i'm luck to get 2 useable days
Kdude dont we all wish for that?
if i wasn't mentally disabled before i entered the school i definatly am now
i would give them my money, why dont they want my money :'(
i want plushies
i demand plushies
i get over 900 euro a month but half of that will dissapear when i get a job
i pretend plushies
though I don;t really want to go though all the bull shit needed to claim disability
all those Doctors and such
not really worth it. the change of school made me lose any friend i had left
and when school ended once again
any of u have that friend from school you hang out with after school?
obviously...
that was only possible for me as long as i went to school
06Burn me
/me burns VioletVanilla
Uuuh.
/me douses Violet flames
:3 fire cleans everything
when it ended i barly even hear from them. tough my best pal still sends me usefull sites
fire is fun
so crackely
and hot
pyro?
maybe
Hey The_Flyin_King I'm your alter ego!

07,01in a bit there will be :)
hallo folks
hey Arentius
how are we doing today
08,01furururu
well now i'm just confused
Woona
Wait if theres no air on the moon does that mean luna has to ALWAYS use magic to keep her breathing?
07,01ya rang?
Hi
she made a special force field that has air
07,01Hi AllisZero
Howru
06Delicious and yourself? ;3
Sleepy as a 'mofo, had insomnia most of the night
And the rest I dreamed of scary shit
Unless luna is using cyro or something
The force field made sense though
otherwise she would just fly back to equestria
somehow
08,01VioletVanilla~
08,01check da shower O_O
Hey.
how're you dari?
/me slept in the shower~
08,01what a surprise! so did I!
08,01XD
wow 5 server disconnects that was fun and laggy
08,01srsly tho check showerchat if ya can lol
I'm ok thanks, and yourself?
Well I gotta get back to school.
Bye
Pretty good thanks :)
you had a good day?
that is because it is amazing music
hey there
07,01hey it's a great movie too
listen to ALL the songs!!!!!
aloha kirz
if I don't respond at first it's because I'm working on a picture, checking the chat every 10-15min
08,01sooo Luna anything on stream yet? and which one will you be usin'?
hehe fair enough
not like much is going on at the mo anyway :p
06That is great movie. . .
/me for some reason wants to have another s1 marathon... sigh
I must have seen every pony episode at least 12 times
only 12?
you're letting the team down:P
08,01I've only seen each ep about... three times
*pinkie pie style gasp*
maybe i'm just an addict..
08,01eh don't have much personal time
by 12 I mean my least fav must have hit 12 by now
oh thats ok then
I has too much
its fun not having a life :D
and I don't sleep
i has loads o time but most of it goes into the fanfic
tough lately i'm a bit stuck
/me yawns likes ans lion
08,01well, it's not personal time in that sense so much. I have a dorm room all to myself...
08,01so I probably could have a marathon
08,01but I like to be on bronystate a lot
08,01o_O so I can watch you guys...
08,01XD
same ^
x3
haha yeah bronystate has kept me up till like 4-5am the past 3 days in a row..
learn to window oh Fluttershy`
07,01amazing right? :)
or dual screen
08,01I do know how to window
I haven't really left all weekend bar sleep
08,01I just love BronyState so much
you're partially to blame for my sleep deprivation Luna!
i only sleep about 4 hours a day anyway so bronystate either keeps me up longer or just keeps me from being bored
/me is sowwy
I wasn't complaining ;)
/me hugs Woona
08,01sleep deprivation...
Luna I got asked to a gig tonight for free
08,01mmm
turned it down cos nostailger is way better
sleep dep mays everying better
08,01bronystate + irl problems + rping with Silver = no time for anything else xD
sleep is for the weak
/me currently training for a 2 week no sleep
why would you do that :o
2 weeks is likely rather dangerious
yeah just a bit
hallucinate = ponies
08,012 weeks?
need i say any more
08,01isn't that technically impossible?
dude you need 72+ to hall
anyone wanna help me with my fanfic with suggestions?
hey ppls
2 weeks will most likely kill you
i;ve done a week and a half due to my insomnia
Dumorimasoddaa i done a week without sleep...
then i slept for 3 days
that was badtimes
crazy ponies
same Arentius more or less
wasn't by choice
I hate losing dats
it's weird
my dr wouldn't give me sleeping pills cause he thought i was lying -.-
08,012 weeks of no sleep is impossible
08,01it will kill you
and I can treb!
nah theres been a recorded case of someone staying up for 3
he was clinically insane
but alive
Fluttershy` im willing to test it... if i feel really terrible then i will sleep
yeah
08,01....how about you just not risk it
08,01I would be horrified if you died ;___;
and people have done huge amount of time on really little sleep
i'm a little stumped cus i want the Spy and Rarity to have more interaction. any ideas?
ooo you're the writer of the TF2 fic? :o
voyerism?
You cant kill yourself from lack of sleep, your body will shut down whether you like it or not.
it's a form of interaction
Rainbow-Dash not true
08,01true... but still... :< there are ways to force one to stay awake from energy drinks and caffeine pills..
other wise people wouldn't have died from it
your body de-toxifies when you sleep
Arentius: Talk in the main channel then, more people. :P
if you have enough caffiene you just become immune
06Rainbow-Dash
if you dont sleep, it makes a strain on your body, your brain is not going to function properly and etc
I am talking in the main channel! but i like it in here cause its slower
but 1 week done nothing to me
Hm
I'm almost reversed in the effect caffien has on me
sorry i disconnected for a sec
I makes me sleepy soem times
lol
i dont like the taste of coffee, only the smell
I love coffee
laterss ppls
anyway meke sure it's the right TF2 fic ur thinking of. on fanfic.net im #8 XD
checking now >.> only seen one though
08,01PINKAY
/me glomps RobotPinkie
06,15:O

06,15all you have to do is take a cup of ramen, add it to the mix!
I have £7 to my name but I cant really take it out the bank
Sodium and Noodles DashWithRainbows, its awesome.
Lol
I've had like 10lbs of meat to eat in the last 3 days
hmmm... i may try it
08,01now just add a pinch of flavor, salty and full of fish!
06,15That's.... a bit excessive on the meat :P
a man can never have to much meat to eat RobotPinkie
06,15lol Fluttershy`, that was amazing
Never can have too much meat
06,15I dunno, had a bit of mutton this weekend, from parents' own farm. I like that kind of thing.
06,15Can't really afford it on my own, so...
I had lamb and pork from a smokehouse
08,01I like thin strips of beef that are cooked in breadcrumbs and curry~
I want ramen now
I have 5p
I like meat and bread
Also
I can;t even afford noodles
ewww curry
Cheese pita
06,15Curry <3

*ew
A burger without meat
10Arentius, battered cod? With chips?
Rainbrodash: Yup I live 5 mins away from a chippy on the seafront
08,01what?
06,15The only cod I can accept is cod 2-4
and lots of salt and vinegar
10I so jelly
omnomnom
/me offers the mods tasty tasty fish
06,15MAYBE World at War, too
bad pun is bad Rhobot
10I live a little while out of Brighton, I live @ University of Sussex in Falmer now... So I have to take a bus to my nearest chippy
06,15because Keifer Sutherland
:o you're not too far from me rainbro
10So sad to leave my hometown and my chippy
10:<
Pompey lad here
10Righto :3
06,15I know, Dumorimasoddaa
/me sings "its a small world afterall"
10XD
06,15would you rather me make bad puns or discuss my favorite pizza place? :P
robotpinkie: can you make bad puns about your favourite pizza place and give us the best of both?
I'm on.
06,15I... don't know
don;t really miond now
10Try :D
08,01I technically live about 10 or so miles away from Val XD
you must! you must you must you must!
06,15I probably could, but I'd feel really bad about it
i've engange stoic hunger mode
/me has returned with his triple decker sammich
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSUzIU03dFo&feature=related
well rainbrodash is like...30 mins by train from me...apparently....and now i feel like a stalker
moist and delicious!
*cough*
greetz
Hey bronies, how's it going?
lo rod! not bad yerself?
06,15Yeah there's this amazing pizza place near where I used to live, only pizza place I've seen that's actually owned by an italian :P
So, my dorm room is about to take the first ponification step
9/10 for effort pinkie, I had to slice off a bit for going with the obvious though
08,01moist and delicious?
10Orly FreezeFrame
08,01Moist. And. Delicious.
08,01XD
Free signs at the student lounge = 20% cooler sign
Specifically, Danger: This room is 20% cooler. Enter at your own risk.
my sammich is filled with ham, cheese, cucumber and my favourite BBQ SAUCE!
Hmm
ewww BBQ sauce is a violation on everything bug chargrilled steaks
its good on chicken...
RainBro used to live about 20 mintues from me.
06,15lol no Arentius, that's no joke, I literally haven't seen it elsewhere
Then he went to uni. >_>
10Dari hurry up and turn 18 and we can go drinking in Brighton
10kthx.
robotpinkie: i'm sad you missed my little return pun :(
llol
Speaking of making dorms 20% cooler, I recently found this place in town to print posters
10Rodman do eeeeet
Pubs are overrated, come back to the fields, yo. :P
I simply NEED to stop by there, take my USB, and print me some pony
06,15No I got the pun, but presumably you were still serious about me making a joke :P
10XD rofl dari, o u
why are all the mods living withing my vicinity of the country! ....uk brony meetup needed
oui^
lol Dari
06,15I don't like pizzas with soggy crust...
I'd walking there
no one does RobotPinkie
I can make that
walk it*
06,15If there's a huge brony meetup in the UK, I'd totally go even though I'm not from there...
agreed robotpinkie crispy thin based pizza ftw
I think we should sort a UK brony meetup
/me is a South Yorkshire brony
Fushicon would be a good meetup xD
i can't make it to that end of the country :(
06,15Unsurprisingly, perhaps, italians make really good pizza :P
hey Lasharus
Good evening :)
06,15I wonder if they're also good at plumbing, or if that's just fiction...
i should get a cooler
bahaha
and write "20%" on it
Crusty pizza, good stuff
Hey everyone I know.
And hey everyone I don't know.
06,15Hay Lasharus
I did get a rainbow dash drawn on my dominoes pizza box
nice^
Hi Lasharus
but myf riend stole it :(
Arentius, pics
Awwww
tell me where he lives, i will kick him in the dick
I'll get another one done :P
Be nice DashWithRainbows. :P
i think it'll have to be fluttershy next
stealing is wrong = must be punished = my foot is justice
06,15That was an amazing idea with the dominos request... I wonder who thought of it
I've seen it done a few times
so tested it myself
Seen several images of weird requests on pizza orders that were actually fulfilled.
06,15I'd just try with "draw best pony on the box"
Might be pushing it. :P
can't guarantee that they're all bronies, after all.
...i really want to order dominoes now
just for the pony
Heh, I already ate.
same
i just want my pony box
06,15Well, obviously they're not all bronies, but I'd still like to try...
You'd get Dash back of course.
06,15and if I got a box with Pinkie Pie on it, my head would explode
i could order dominoes but i am saving up cash for Fushicon and Halo anniversary
Point taken RobotPinkie.
That's a weird way of spelling Rarity, dari
That's not suspicion.
You might've confused that name for Twilight's.
Dash is best pony.
^
:P
Therefore if you ask for best pony, you can only receive Dash.
robotpinkie: my plan is to get all the ponies eventually
Actually, I'm with DashWithRainbows.
Dash is my favorite
Imagine if you ask for best pony and you get a drawing of Taste the Rainbow
Agreed Dari
06,15That sounds like a pretty cool plan... then upload a pic with all the boxes in it, Arentius?
Unless the people at Dominoes have some sort of twisted reality stuck in their heads, of course.
dash is best pony
Being a loyal person myself...
robot pinkie: I will do!
I'll avoid promoting "best pony". It appears to be a bit of a wasp's nest to get into.
Lasharus: It's all in good fun.
Well I've run out of big Mountains to take Twilight up in the UK.
...what
Oh most assuredly FreezeFrame. :P
All ponies are best, but Dash is my favorite.
MFW capital 'M' for no reason.
:)
INB4 Everest.
I would love to do tht.
That'll work for me denied_existence. :)
/confluttershied
06,15Prince Blueblood is most definitely not best pony :P
that*
It's not like I'm threatening to hateshank bronies who disagree.
inb4 Ben nevis
^ already done
...did you just say that Alex?
RobotPinkie: I think everyone can agree
You mean inafter
:P
08,01shower
RainBro's shower?
08,01and plots
08,01lots of plots
such a demanding girl now isnt she?
And yes, hateshank you with your own horn is my favorite saying thanks to a comedy shipfic.
...that's a novel sentiment FreezeFrame.
It was a Rarijack where AJ carried their child.
XD
08,01plots and showers... oh gawds...
And had twins
RobotPinkie: You misspelled BRIAN BLESSED. :P
Makes me wish i had wings...
That's Twilight atop Ben Nevis.
06,15lol oh of course, FreezeFrame
It was damn cold up there.
my god....
I had ice forming on me.
08,01it's so cold here...
...what the hell.
08,01brrrrr
And I was soaking wet because I'd climbed up a stream for a shortcut.
I would totally give people wing hugs.
06,15I should start taking pics of Pinkie Pie in cool places in Sweden....
08,01I live in the friggin' mountains :<
this is reaching epic proportions from which my head explodes
Where's Ben Nevis again?
/me is basking in wondrous 60 degree temperature
08,01and it's SO COLD
Iceland?
It seems like Iceland.
Ben Nevis is the biggest mountinain the UK.
wooo mass of messages
06,15On top of the Globe, maybe?
and yes i did lash
because i can
06,15...though that'll cost some money...
Grmpf.
It's in Scotland.
Anyway, how is everyone?
So...
Pardon me. Everypony?
Ah, cool.
Geographic, or magnetic?
/me puts DashWithRainbows head in a bucket to prevent mess
08,01I live in UTAH
Something about wrapping myself up with a pair of wings just sounds warm and comfy as hell...
08,01but...
/me is proud she did the Ben!
Since he's a UK citizen, it's easy enough for him to get to Canadia
08,01it's so cold ;___;
08,01especially at dis elevation
Dread Pirate Woona?
Canadia....SRSLY BRO??? IT'S Canada! GRAMMAR NAZI AWAY!!
I did Ben Nevis in 2 hours and 10 minutes.
I'm pretty proud of that.
I was so disappoint I didn't make 2 hours though. XD
06,15You mean SPELLING nazi, DashWithRainbows. :P
DashWithRainbows: I was doing that intentionally.
For gods sake, if medical technology advances enough, I am getting a pair of goddamn wings.
That was overcapitalisation RobotPinkie.
08,01biotechnology ftw!
I don't care if it's for the purposes of emphasis.
/me flips a table "look a distraction!"
I'm well aware that the 51st state is spelled Canada. :P
07,01suddenly
07,01silence
And then I will just lie in bed wrPped in them for like a week
Hey Luna. :)
/me slaps Lasharus with a large TROUT
06,15:P
08,01not for long!
...what was THAT for?
stupid chat keeps breaking
Ow!
Pinkie stop destroying reality!
/me glomps Luna
wrapped*
woooonnaaaa!
06,15No one likes trouts?
/me wishes he could his computer to hsi bed
I prefer Tuna
Well, not to the face, no.
08,01I like trains
i prefer Cod...
really wants to nest
06,15Ohay Luna
/me glomps Luna.
Been there dari
is a fun hike
But yeah RobotPinkie, if you want to slap me with something, something non-fishy would be appreciated.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAXhIQoRYvs <-- O.o
Wooonnnaaa!
Optimus must have a cold.
/me slaps Lasharus with a tree
...that'll do.
Snowdon took 1 hour 34 minutes.
Now I want to take one up Mount Marcy
seen it EspyLacopa
06,15I'll remember that next time, Lasharus :P
No stench. The splinters are mildly annoying though.
It's the tallest mountain in my state.
it was a varnished tree...
/me slaps some pony with some other pony
A...
A varnished...
It was so much more hospitable, it had a damn cafe at the top.
..............
07,01what happened...
Arentius: Why are you hitting people with Fluttershy? :P
06,15Ohay again, LunaShy
argle.
07,01I just dc-d..
Ben Nevis was like... I dunno, a different world. O_o
dat LunaShy
Ah. Welcome back Luna. :)
*prods lash* ...i think i broke him
brw?
Woooonna! welcome back
Nevis a real hike
Freeze: i was wondering who would make that comment...and because shes soft fluffy and unable to actually hurt people
5,344 feet (1,629 meters)
or be hurt by it herself
wubble?
Heh, that's bigger than Ben Nevis FreezeFrame.
Still not tall enough to have a snowline
*gargling noises*
yeah no British mount has a snow line
*pokes lasharus again*
The article picture on it is in the summer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Marcy_%28New_York%29
yeah definately broken
/me shakes himself.
Sorry about that gentlemen. I can't be quite sure what came over me.
*pilfers wallet*
/me smacks Arentius.
Should've been a BIT faster.
/me has a lot of mountains in his state.
:(
L;(
:'( *
/me retrieves his wallet. Nice try Arentius.
/me thorws a brick at Dumori
not sure where that L came from
Since the Appalachains, Catskills, and Adirondacks are all in upstate NY
Anyway, not sure what happened to my brain. Apparently someone said something so inconceivably THICK I shut down for a moment.
my bad
And given that it would be someone saying something THICK, the blame naturally falls on Arentius.
See?
well, the Appalachains go through, I should say.
*waves to everypont and bows*
i give up on spelling -.-
Spelling is for the week
And, should you try to drive me nuts again, on life.
Dumori? I may have to injure you now. I'll try to be nice.
go ahead
*NUKE*
Well, I tried.
nuke pfft lazy
Dumori wins
*sigh*
I /could/ go into WoW to hunt down rare items. . .but I'm finding a lack of interest now. Possibly due to lack of ponies.
WoW needs pony mounts
...I now wonder if there's a mod that converts models into ponies.
you could hunt rare ponies in WOW
no idea if they exist but thats why you hunt
Herdmind lash
Ghehe.
...What if the Worgen were werePONIES instead of werewolves?
06,15If they just reskinned the entirety of WoW to a pony game, I'd buy that
:P
that would be awesome...cause when they go into running free mode they can just be normal ponies
06,15Just pony mounts though? I don't think so
I'd racechange so fast your head would spin Espy.
someone might be working on that
Don't know Treb.
OK someone needs to make World of ponycraft a real game
And until now they've been ruled by Nightmare Moon, but during all the Cataclysm nonsense, they finally deposed her and regained their senses.
It's not as easy as just reskinning.
That's one way of working through Gilneas' storyline Espy. :P
You could have nightmare moons followers and celestias followers for the factions
What, the Nightmarish Horde and the Celestial Alliance?
in essence
:P
06,15Sounds good to me.
Could work.
Would be 200% cooler than goblins.
Garrosh would work as nightmare moon
Except the Horde are not evil
then set it back during the first war
That's ok, Luna isn't evil either.
when they were bloodthirsty and demon posessed
Yes, but NMM is
Celestia helping out the Alliance, Luna with the Horde, working to bring both sides to harmony.
With the Nightmares teaming up with the Twilight Hammer cult.
the twilight hammer cult needs to be redone in lore
sweet sweet coffee
The Twilight Nightmare Cult?
...to be obsessed with twilight
I come back from lunch and there's talk of World of Equinecraft?
Oh deary me.
Essentially so AllisZaro.
and twilight becomes an old one
Welcome back.
AllisZero: Because WoW doesn't have enough pony.
I blame Lash
C'thwilight, Arentius? :P
hence why shes celestias prized student
Yep, it does not
xD
Also hi everypony, RobotPinkie
Thank you Kirz. :P
06,15Hay AllisZero
I take the blame happily.
...goddamnit, I'm going to have to start writing a fanfic now, aren't I?
Lash lets get on it
Well, that could work. :P
So I figure the werePonies could get say, Paladin, Druid, Warrior, Hunter, Priest, and Mage.
06,15I think I need to go play a bit of ICO
D'aww.
i disliked ICO
And that could work Espy.
Applejack - Paladin; Fluttershy - Druid; Twilight - Mage; Rainbow Dash - Rogue; Rarity - Priest; Pinkie - Death Knight (?)
06,15I love everything about ICO, except the battles...
I've played as a mage for over 6 years. Race-changing wouldn't be a problem whatsoever. :P
06,15Unfortunately there are a lot of battles, but eh... they're not that hard, just boring...
Nah, Death Knights are for every race, I don't count them.
Pinkie as a warlock?
i would put pinkie as a warlock
/me actually dislikes WoW. So this cnovo is way over his head
Wow.
I totally forgot about MY Class
Heh, sorry Dumorimasoddaa.
she breaks the fourth wall too much
np
That's kinda sad AllisZero :P
never played WoW, never will
it's better than food
Yeah it is...
every talking about food
I guess Warlock isn't just a class for me, it's a lifestyle!
when you ve just said youve hardly eatten for 5 days
06,15In Batmare, Pinkie Pie would totally be The Riddler. That's all I have to say. :P
Oh dear...
Not 100% sure RobotPinkie
In Batmare, Pinkie would be Mister Mysterio.
Complete with fishbowl hat.
06,15that would be Spider-Mare, wouldn't it? :P
So much rage on the Battlelog forums
No no, this is Batmare.
But remember. Pinkie Pie.
no batmare pinkie would be the riddler...or the joker
HAHAHA
I just googled Cyanide
To get quickly to Cyanide and Happiness
This is my first result:
Purchase Of Cyanide Everyone Wants to Pay a Low Price. Deals - Purchase Of Cyanide! www.NexTag.com
........wot.
I'll admit that that's vaguely disturbing.
Right, tonight's raid is going to be hilarious.
I'll be on the chat here, raiding in WoW, and transcribing a text for uni.
...Got voice chat for your WoW raid?
Yup.
06,15Wow, low price on cyanide, where do I sign up? :P
Going to break into song during a break in the raid?
God no.
I don't sing, I play guitar.
...Keep the guitar close.
Why?
I got banned from ventrilo once for playing the FiM soundboard... a bit too much
Hah.
lol^
06,15Sing WWU during LK raid, srsly...
RobotPinkie, could you fix something for me quickly?
My raid leader is a narrow-minded douche so what can you say
Arentius DC'd, but he's still 'in' the chatroom. Could you kick him so he can rejoin?
I'm actually planning on writing a Healthstone song based on Cupcakes
06,15It's not going to help, Lasharus, he won't be able to rejoin until ping timeout :(
Imagine if you started singing WWU during said LK raid. . .and other raid members joined in.
Bugger. How long'll that be?
250 secs +/- 5
06,15200 something seconds
Ouch.
tell him to join with _ at the end of his name
Oh well, I informed him on Skype.
06,15If he joins under another name, he'll be able to see when Arentius times out though
then just /nick the name back
Eh, his internet's committing suicide on him, apparently.
Oh damnit. Heroic modes.
and this is why you reg and ghost every pony
06,15Yeah now he can join again :P
06,15and did.
i return!
Welcome back!
06,15Welcome back, Arentius
Also, what do you mean Dumori?
thankies :)
We suffered thru heroic Alysrazor last night
set it to ghost
Two hours of pain, and people STILL getting hit by the nerfed tornadoes
then you can rejoin and it will auto kick the other name
but it works best if you have a dedicated irc client
want to know a random fact?
i'm almost out of tolerance for my net -.-
random fact :o
06,15Yeah, registering your nick is a good plan...
I dislike wow to play but I used to do builds
I want to know a random fact.
in wrath
x3
Can I register my nickname from this in-browser chat system?
And neat Dumori. :P
06,15I'm gonna go play a bit, have fun everypony
full statistics ect
bye RobotPinkie!
bye pinkie!
You too RobotPinkie :)
06,15and yeah I'm pretty sure you can, Lasharus
...I need to know commands. :P
I lost all my sheets when my PC ate it's self and couldn't be arsed to do them all again for Cat
Fact: The Forsaken are douches.
plus you know patches make it a faff too
Fact: Yup.
did the same for PvP and PvE guild wars builds
06,15I know :P Pretty sure it's /ns register PASSWORD EMAIL
Fact: you are currently using the internet
get the full list of commands and such
That one does nothing.
(the help request)
humm odd
06,15it's because there was an additional E at the end
Ok
We're going to do a little test.
oops added an e
Can you see the stream?
one sec
is their cake at the end Dari
I cannot see the stream
Yes I can Dari
do i fal?
yes
fail*
yeah
....*sigh*
I can see
works
Yup
07,01what do you see?
Black.
07,01tell me tell me tell me!
blocky needing AA words
Jonathon Creek
Jonathon creek
Jonathan Creek
now a sad naked clown
Bewbies
07,01hows the quality?
Fairly good.
a bit blocky luna
also why nude clowns
Hmmmmm. A bit on the pixelated side.
no stream for me *sulk*
07,01arentius
07,01clear your cache
07,01and try again
okie dokes
Hmm.
I'll change quality.
One sec.
/me twiddlethumbs
/me twiddlethumbs?
Ok, no more movie, but what is there. . .text? Maybe?
Too pixelated to read.
wait thumbs? WHAT BLACK MAGIC IS THIS!?!
Okay, I'm now registered with this name.
How do I 'log in', as it were?
Hmm.
Ah.
....luna has thumbs...she is luna it is allowed
password does not need brackets
Luna, I dunno how we can change FMS to make the quality better.
for example
Oh yes, there we go.
Why did it need my e-mail address then?
Yeah, it works.
It's watchable, it just happens to be pixelated still.
06,15So new streaming service?
wha
oh
How does that whole ghost thing work then, while I"m at it?
It looks as though it's being filtered through something that is forcing the resolution down to 240p or so.
Might as well learn al I can, after all :)
Luna can i have the test link again please? :)
I concur with the others though - it does seem a bit pixellated.
ty
it works
!
:)
That it does.
On the plus side, it's not lagging.
But as said - it seems a bit pixelly. Still, nice. :)
06,15The whole ghost thing is most likely done by /ns ghost USERNAME PASSWORD
This is our own streaming service, set up FMS on Luna's spare PC.
it keeps freezing for me...though thats most likely my internet
it's ghost nick pass yeah
so what do you do to register the nickname? had to refresh and missed that part
nick being the reg'd/grouped nick
What ghost thing?
So, still some problems to work out.
/ns won;t work on some clients
It will
its probably me with the lag Dari so exclude that for now unless someone else mentions it
It's a network built in alias.
I've registered on equestria daily just not here because i'm more active at equestria
/me 's client waves
06,15It depends on server, not client, Dumorimasoddaa
It will work on every client.
same nickname
short name times
06,15so on this IRC server, /ns will always work
Eeyup.
and now you know my name is short for a longer one
Oh, wait, that's for identify.
nope
my client don't likey
What client?
its a bastard of a client
You'll have to do the identify when you log on each time.
If it doesn't work, then your client is actively blocking it.
Which is a stupid feature.
the fubar'd one I hacked up
yeah
I know
I'm not sure where that "feature" is in the code
06,15So what's streaming right now?
as only half the IRC code is my own
I'm restreaming the first episode of Jonathon Creek. XD
RobotPinkie Jonathon Creek
Since my hard drive isn't connected.
06,15Ooooh, nice
06,15I haven't seen this episode in... I dunno, couple of years I guess.
06,15and here I was gonna go play games :P
not a creek fan tbh
You suck. :P
/me has decided that he's gonna use jawesome way too much
06,15:O
A quick check - the test stream is running, but the actual stream's not started yet, right?
she has returned!
yes^
What actual stream? O_o
looks that way
06,15Yeah House is in.... not sure how long
Ah right.
06,15or is House on hold this week?
About an hour and a half, I understood.
(according to Luna)
08,01>;3
07,01oui zat is correct
/me isn't trying to work out an so jawesome face
Yeah, I thought people were talking about an official stream.
08,01hehe feel like being PinkiusPiacus for a bit!
I was going to say, lawl, that's not till Friday.
/)^w^(\ so jawesome
06,15Pinkius is best Piacus
it semi works
Yay Luna. :)
Thanks for confirming.
08,01I'm in a Pinkie mood right now! Yippee!
Uhoh.
06,15Pinkie mood is best mood!
I had caffine and I'm also no sleep hyper
Yes, but two pinkies?
The world will end...
06,15Double Pinkie all the way across the sky?
Lasharus we normaly have 10 Flutters
08,01PINKIE!
Lasharus as long as they discover caffeeine we will be okay
Point taken Dumori.
dont discover*
caffeeine is best ien
08,01Hehehee!
06,15omg, so intense!
I like caffeine
08,01omai goodness!
keep the pinkies away from relentless
This won't end well..
random bass heavy pinkie remixes + my curent state
08,01everypony is transforming!
08,01hehehe!
this is fun :D
06,15HENSHIN!
we can transform!?
cos I can make pun names
:3
/me sulks in a corner with his imaginary friends
08,01Awwww
/me juggels turnips
/me joins RobotPinkamena
/me and ROCKS
/me 's hair goes PFOOMF
08,01Yay! -hugs RobotPinkie-
/me hugs PinkiusPiacus
06,15Much better, now.
/me hugs PinkiusPiacus while still juggeling
I might just tag every pony song I have with the pony genre
06,15I need to keep practicing my contact juggling...
my name amuses me too much
Ghehe.
06,15Pony is a musical genre?
i wish i could contact juggle
I tried
i kept dropping it on my foot
06,15>tried
I'll stick to fire staff/flowersticks
06,15What you do is practice for months and months :P
i did
06,15I can barely do anything yet.
i crushed my foot 20 times
xD
06,15ouch, you need to start with a fairly sizeable stage ball, srsly :P
Juggeling is fun
I keep forgeting how IRL
i have a proper contact ball acrylic 160mm
06,15Starting with acrylic is a sure way to fail, pretty much
stupid dispraxia makes everything harder
06,15ouch, yeah, that's not fun when you drop it
i decided to start practicing over my bed
I couldn't catch a ball thrown at me till I was 12
so it goes fwumpf
instead of crunch
06,15You're good with flower sticks?
06Ohmy~
Ouch.
Getting there
I can chain a few tricks together
I wouldn't say i'm great but i'm passable :0
08,01hehehe
Ghehe.
I have all my martal based skills
06,15I can't juggle that well yet, so...
My skill at juggling can best be described as not.
not very flashy though
juggling is also fun
No ball sense whatsoever.
I am? Oh, thank you, you're all too kind. :D
06,15I can do 3 clubs, decent flourish with each hand
Clubs annoy me
I can try to juggle and drop all the balls immediately, if that helps.
06,15Still, I'll always be an amateur
mainly cause i can't do them
but still
I'm going for my CRB in staff teaching soon
right now I can't juggel but I used to be able to trick juggle a full dice set
06,15lol clubs are hard to start with, I got so many splinter hemorrhages the first couple of months
d4-d100
06,15CRB?
is harder than is sounds so small
teaching certificate
and they like to tumble and boune off you hands
I'll be legally allowed to charge people for lessons
and run workshops
06,15That's really hard, DoMorePinkie, yeah, I couldn't do that
thats 7 dice
06,15I can't even do 5 balls yet :P
in air at once and doing those visral tricks
EQD hits 50 million tomorrow woot
I don't know how I learnt that tick I must have gone eh this would look fun to do as a GM
and tryed
but I just tyhrow my dice around a room now
06,15I can barely do 4 balls, and not for more than 20 or so throws, lol
i evne geeked out so much i bought an ultrasaber to use for staff spinning xD
try a few d6
just 3
even*
its weird
they down like staing in you hands
06,15that's cool, Arentius, lol
3d6 isn't too bad
;D
Lawl
Stabbed her.
hehe
Sorry if my activity drops a bit for now btw guys.
I just know basic poll arm fighting
I'm sorta in mid-raid just now, so yeah. Apparently they need me :P
06,15Yeah 3 dice is pretty easy, I do that all the time during pen and paper games...
staff fighting is fun too
from bo-staff to pike
most useless skills EVER
hardly
hwo ofthen do I need to use a pike
Go to a public place with a friend then duel
get crowd
filmed
youtube fame
become richer than rebecca black
??????
profit
I mean bo-staff and quater staff I get
but why did I learn bills and pikes ect
I'm also a passable warsword duelest
mostly self taught
06,15Yeah I can't do anything like that
but one of my ex's is a renactor so I learnt more of him
06,15some basic staff twirling, no fighting :P
and I'm a wanna be pro fencer
Hm, I tried fencing a couple times.
I like fighting
if you can twirl a staff you can fight with one, the two skills transitio well
it's fun
Once in France.
So hot.
oh yeah
Full suit + helmet.
try a 15 min bout in that
X_X
06,15Hmmm, maybe Arentius, but I'm betting it still takes a lot of practice to get really good
while moive up and down the peice liek a daemon
Oh most definately Robotpinkie...i've concussed myself more than once
I've spent most of today training
Nooo, the site I used for downloading MLP:FiM episodes collapsed.
This comes as no surprise...
solid aluminium cores + 100ml kevlar wicks on wet ground do not mix well
for 18 months
06,15I've gotten some really nasty bruises from juggling clubs, but I don't get them much anymore thankfully
At least the clubs weren't on fire.
I have scars from epee duels
Not seen anyone really hurt themselves with clubs yet
Really shouldn't have clicked that link. :P
Yay chatroom breakage.
Hah, I have some pretty good scars.
from my right wrist all the way up to my armpit
06,15They're pretty well padded, the practice clubs, but they travel at pretty high speeds
it's just fencing scars are rare bar accidents with all that gear
but it was from a massive friction burn
06,15seen someone get a really nasty split in the lower lip, but yeah, nothing that won't heal :P
hehe
Don't be so sure RobotPinkie.
Worst injury i saw is someone hitting themself in the face with a light fire staff
I've had to stich my own wounds before
Arentius here hit himself in the face repeatedly. "nothing that won't heal"?
I haven't
-.-
was to the bone on my leg
*grin*
die in a fire....of tolerance
06,15Fire clubs aren't so bad though
IT BURNS WITH KINDNESS!
healed neatly too but I did go the A&E with it
06,15just... don't use them before you're fairly handy with the practice clubs :P
x3
Ghehe.
but but but
FIRE
so pretty
Fire's fun for all the family. :D
Spoken like a true arsonist.
I burned myself during a burnoff once...fireballs kinda turned into fire pillars half my height, scorched both arms xD
06,15Yeah, I mean just doing a 3 club cascade with fire clubs looks awesome
it hurts, it warms it even lights up the room it's new FIRE!
has a hint of pyromania
06,15ouch, Arentius, that sounds painful
How about a whip lit on fire?
You can't really resist it though, you have something flammable, and a lighter. *set hand on fire*
It isn't so bad RobotPinkie, i only lost my arm hair xD
06,15lol oh okay
^owch
not like my friend who set his head on fire
muppet forgot to soak his hair in water
Well, that sucks.
06,15I need to get some fire clubs, but the good ones are so expensive :(
firetoys.co.uk has decent prices
hehe
/me has an entire arsenal in my attic basement to suit all your needs.
06,15Yeah I want a special set though... :P
Hair smells funny after being exposed to fire
you can get special sets from firetoys >.>
I shoudl know I used to have hair down to my waist
06,15Well, I'll have a look
Always fun.
Is anyone currently on the stream, or should I end it?
well...they range from £17-30 per torch
maybe not
07,01I think you may end it
07,01since no pony responded
Ok.
im not on the stream, i wasnt aware you were streaming
yeah you should end it, i lost interest in the first 3 minutes
OOO firetoys updated their flame dyes
Pfft, if you don't like Jonathan Creek, you suck.
06,15it went offline? :(
07,01lol..
Well no one was watching it?
06,15I was watching, damn... oh well :P
hay guys
06,15I'll look up the rest on youtube
Zeph's back, quick, everypony hide
Well I'll leave it on anyway.
06,15Yay! Thanks
o hai
06,15and yeah, they don't have the torches I want to buy, unfortunately, though good prices.
lol stryfe
pity :9
06,15It's a VERY special design I'm after, you can modify the flame mid juggle
they have fire swords though
*is tempted
oo cool
06,15Costs maybe 10 pounds extra, but I think it'll be worth it
So
anyone read this yet? http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/story-dairies-of-equestrian-overlord.html
Yup.
Quite amusing.
god I loved it
for only £10? deffo
I want that flame dye though
Green flame would be awesome
and I hate the fanon side he followed, of the troll crazy Celestia
D:
06,15Well it's £10 extra per club, compared to pro torches
still worth it
06,15Well, yeah. I just have to find them again. Used to be sold at a Swedish juggling store
Hi everypony :D
always a pain when yo ulose them :(
06,15I know it was a Swedish brand, too, but I don't remember the name :(
hey Flutterz
gotta go to oddballs now
06,15There's pretty much one juggling store in Stockholm, lawl
Evening
hi flaschen
lo flutterz and flaschen
oh and flutterz
kinda missed
:P
it happens :P
I love capital cities, they always have the best niche shops.
well mostly
06,15Yeah, though they can be hard to find
yeah
I know
just found out the the second win7 that i got in a row from ebay is fake >.<
the fencign supply shop in London is a reall bitch to get too
gonna have to get the person to give me a refund, again
but I'm very tempted by a for and epee both french grip
06,15I'm always tempted to buy more juggling stuff, hehe
you and me both Robotpinkie
06,15I'm like a kid in a candy store when I go there, so much fun stuff
same i could live in oddballs
06Für Tod und Deutschland!!!
06,15:O
/me runs as she launches herself off the cliffs of dover
http://www.leonpaul.com/ I could this site for days. So much quailty and such
/me puts a trampoline under violet
just you know expencive sport really
06,15yay more Jonathan Creek!
Bwuh?
plus I'm an amidexrus guy so I need to buy at least two of each blade type I use to trian fully
:z
/me shrugs to the actions of Violet "I have no Idea what she's doing."
06,15Oh wow, you too?
you have to be ambi to be a juggler
lookign at £30 per blade not including the grips ect
going cheapest
06,15Not really, no, most jugglers just practice twice as hard with their left hand :P
i'm left handed so HAH!
06,15I have to practice slightly more with my right, though
>assuming everyone is right handed
<_<
>_>
I'm technicaly no handed
I'm sure
due to my dyspraxia
the awkward moment when most of bronystate is actually lefthanded
06,15Most jugglers are right handed, the rest are mostly left handed, precious few are ambidextrous :P
you mean like any given population? :P
lol I liked Art of the Dress rock version
dyspaxia is a fun disability the lack of co-ordination, the lisp I love it.
06,15Pretty much, yeah
evey thing I can do with either hand has to be fully taught
06,15I'm ambidextrous, used to rely more on my left hand than my right, but one of my teachers flipped out on me over it one time too many....
Lefthanded.
for example I cant write left handend but I can shoot and fence
06,15She was very religious, which was probably connected :P
I eat left handed.
Also being an ambi fencer is the ULTIMATE troll
06,15Haha, good to know Arentius
;)
right v left is a bitch for the one not used to it
and left vs left is also a bithc for pure left fencers
as they are used to the guard being on line all the time
06,15Yeah... people don't like southpaws :P
Nadal is OP on Tennins
thus you can legaly swap hands to troll for best advatage in a torny
because of southpaw
I loved swordfighting as a lefty...it annoyed everyone
/me parties
06,15and they like it even less when you start out in orthodox stance...
yeah Arentius its better ambi
as you can then make the leftys hate you too
;)
it's also really nice with a warsword
as I can flip my stances on demand with no real weakness on my part
06,15I don't do any kind of sword fighting though, obviously...
with archery it's a useless skill
same more or less with rifles
how did I do that dice set juggle
they are so light I cant launch them one by one
i like pony
06,15I wouldn't know, DoMorePinkie :P
I know I've done it
06,15hold the others down, presumably
as my old group calls me out to do it now and again
yeah but 7!
06,15I have to do that when I juggle 3 dice...
lol
06,15Well it's just 4 in one hand maximum, shouldn't be TOO hard to hold :P
I'm so annyoed at thsi old tick now
06,15hopefully last bit of Jonathan creek before House starts...
06,15I'd think the biggest problem would be trajectory
ugh I can't even relaunch the d4 the fecking wobbley bitch
06,15very hard to control the flight path of something so light and uneven
RAAAGE!
MUST KILL BOSS!
RAWR!
I can get flight path as I never did the tick that wide
its making the dice not fly off my hand when they land point down
gah
Still the talk of juggling things?
06,15Oh okay, but with 7? You'd have to get a pretty high arch...
i'm going to use the stare on virgin media if i get my hands on them
sorry bout that :P
yeah
high but wide won't work too small
Did your net die again Alex?
if anyone said anything to me you'll need to repeat it
yeah
:(
Arentius you're and Alex too
Indeed
Yeah, sorry, it's a habit to call him Alex. We've known eachother a while now :P
a while is a bit of an understatement
/me can't even two d20's right now
hehe
*high fives*
Lawl
Suck his face off with that hoover.
am honstly concidering adding Dumorimasoddaa to my name as a middle name
06,15oh lawd
just don't do what that finnish guy did
06,15...ever?
lol
I know
thats just too far if you ask me :P
but nah Dumori has been my name for years
fair play
it's more or less my name in my head
and its a completely unique string
I'm the only person on earth ever to use it
thats oddly cool
:P just a bit
06,15Man, my inverse cascade kinda blows now... should practice more with balls.
inverse cascades are fun
it's technicaly a discordian name
06,15Yeah, really hard when you start out though.
true
Mills still makes me rage
but seeing as most discorsian's randomly gen their name or parts of it
as do takeouts
06,15Pillars are the trickiest for me, just to get them completely straight each time
so what are you raiding right now?
haven;t tried pillars....i can throw a ball under my leg in the middle of a cascade...thats about it xD
also have a link to how I made my name. http://armistis.com/en/generator/
it's a fun program if you need random name ideas
it;s very customisable you can get to much more than random sayable strings
I prefer inventing my own names :P
hehe
06,15looks good, but yeah, I like trying to think up names... or writing my own random name generators :P
same but it's grown alot form the early days when I first used it
Firelands.
06,15only two more parts, I think
Specifically: Majordomo Staghelm.
(slow response, I know. Sorry kirzstryfe :P)
np
saw a vid on that fight a while back, mechanics didn't impress me much :S
06,15Haha, his conclusions are flawless.
06,15Suddenly, silence
sshhhh relish in this unique opportunity :P
http://i.imgur.com/NYM7i.png
http://i.imgur.com/w82RF.png
behold
I'm hunting wabbits.
Products of my boredom
Based on http://derpy.me/nKHA7
06,15lol I was wondering what the logo was based off
06,15love the Derpy
I felt it needed derpy, since the colors and the bubbles are mainly from Derpy
It's actually reasonably well done.
The heroic mode is quite nasty though.
06,15What is her cutie mark, anyway?
bubblewrap
:P
didn't see heroic mode, but isn't normal half saber lash, half meteor-type damage?
Or that's how I read it
06,15lol makes sense
something to
06,15I figured it was snow or something, but I'm not sure how that'd make sense...
I thought it ws just bubbles
not bublewrap >.>
It is.
bubblewrap works if she becomes a mailmare
Derpy = Mailmare in my headcanon :P
Closest I came to raiding was a few runs killing trash to get enough rep for the fancy cloak.
well lauren said she liked the name (i think) and also DJ-pon3 stuck
so maybe she'll be a mailmare too!
and maybe they made dinky ;D
06,15Well, Feeling Pinkie Keen would seem to support that
Personally I hope they don't include any fanon.
And that's how they seem to be going.
they already have after a fashion
nothing majore..but i think names are going in some places
i doubt they'd take our entire idea of certain characters
So far just DJ-Pon3.
06,15There are so many different fanons, so
And that's a character most likely not returning.
06,15I don't think they'll go further than the occasional nod
and Derpy...lauren mentioned her name ages ago and said she wouldnt want to take the name from the fanbase
hm
but they never said if she'd be more then that
so *shrug*
were the hell is he
Lauren said she'd be happy for her to be called Derpy, but it's never come up in the show.
So it's not really canon.
thats the one
2,14 Ditzy*
I couldn't remember exactyl
No Val.
^that would be so awesome)
and I also prefer Ditzy
The original name was Ditzy Doo.
But Lauren said she'd be happy for her to be called Derpy.
Derpy just seems derogatory imo
Ditzy "Derpy" Doo
I prefer Derpy to be honest.
2,14 no, she said that if she were to assign Ditzy Doo a character, that it would be Derpy
07,01NOTICE
07,01in 30 mins House Starts
Good point
yar i remember that Val
better get some snacks ready then...
06,15Jonathan Creek is almost done
Gaaaah
Why is dA taking so long on processing my upload
Because it hates you.
"Background ponies have no name, and their butt symbols are picked at random, so she can be Derpy if everyone likes"
2,14 when was this in comparison to the other comment?
But really, everypony has their own names for the ponies
06,15I like that she calls cutie marks "butt symbols"
:P
06,15This should be canon
Word of God. It is canon. :p
cutie marks are hereafter renamed butt symbols
let it be done!
who?
06,15lawl, timing
hehe
xD
08,01:D
06,15"she's using the evil voice!"

;D
I lack empathy
nah
the one with cuddy trying to adopt are always sad
that's the only time any has made me sad
Yeah, they have some sad ones. That one bugs me 'cuz of the doggy dying. :(
I've seen that before
i havent cried in years
the internet took my soul away as well.
oh I cry alot normaly randomly due to mood swings
internet took my soul, but the ponies found it and brought it back :)
Nice
but sadness due to empathy totaly new to me
i do get emotional at some things just not to the point of crying
there are some songs, specifically chanting (of the sad variety) that tugs on my heart strings on occasion.
Just need a Smug Applejack image
I mena I'm not sobing deffinate leaking though

I wonder if the shows writers knew who was going to get fired/stay at the season start
Alright thanks.

Fluttershy` gets... really deeply into character. to the point of being disturbing
Silvershipper is a mess.

it's all been downhill since they joined >_<
yep
They?
:)

I rather suspect that Weird Al is fundamentally embarassed by this, when he looks back on this.
