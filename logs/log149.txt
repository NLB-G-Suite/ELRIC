The summary: A 60-hour movie where you're allowed to press a button or two.
8 was a fine game...the junction system was just too complicated
/me likes Luna getting naughty
..... i'll be in my bunk.
1 was the best
>yfw you didn't understood shit
And the story was batshit.
once you got the hang of it it was fine
GUINAN IS A HYENA!

Growing up, I always thought Zazu was saying "Major Dodo". I now realize he was saying Majordomo.

My body is not ready, I am not prepared!
YOU ARE NOT PREPARED
I am not prepared
13Haha, nice Saturn
inby streams of tears =(
i found the combat unweildy, the voice actors not close enough to the real ones, and the bosses were pathetic
Herdmind, Crickettwb
NAUGHTY BOY
The combat in that world was fine.
mmmm no
sephiroth was fun to fight though
*rawr*
*yay*
3Dohoho
I preferred that fight in Kingdom Hears 1.
10,2Foreshadow!
Foreshadowing much?
mmm, wildebeest.
Mostly because, having used Alex's strategy for it, you could break the one in 2 completely.
but in kingdom hearts one you couldnt do infinite combos with berserk
That's not clunky.
That's 'unbroken'
dat "go" face
dat chameleon dgaf
*rawr* = *yay*
Is "let's go" face a refernce to something?
STAMPEEEDE
i honestly couldnt do it without berserk
Oh shi-
The horror the horror
WE NEED AJ'S HEARDING SKILLS!
WHERE'S APPLEJACK?!
I'm too slow for everything, I quit Dx
lol
l2type
Wildebeest dun give a fuck.
:D
considering one of his moves is a one hit KO
After hearing Alex' strategy, Sephiroth was a pushover.
took him out at lvl 30
Widebeest should have been one of the Teen Titans
This is my first time =(
liar
Child's movie
Like I said we cheet,
...
13*made
Herdmind.
you cant fight him at level 30
this was the first use of computerised flocking in film
Sure you can.
I never completed the song part lol
if you dont kill anything you dont need to
you can get there low level
pimp slap
I was deprived as a child =(
Low level games are doable.
and i didnt grind at all and i still hit 50
Poor Zazu.
Very poor Zazu.
Nala. WAT.
Everyone beats up Zazu.
GLOMP
Dat part now
Mulan is best disny movie
you need to anti grind
this is second
no, TLK is the best
*SNES*
Mulan was second
seriously?
I am best movie
wow
>imo
Let's get down to business
if you just ignore everything but bosses and forced fights
i dont think i want to do that
but yeah
06Zazu is Rowan Atkins, Ja.
It's not necessary.
;_;
Grab my paw mufasa!
Nala: no he's not? really?
nope.avi
cast it 2/3 times
ADVENTURE!
There's only one way he could do that voice.
07,01meanie!
But beating Sephiroth is simply easy. Abusing Reflectga and you're done.
nope.avi
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/
Magic *snort* *snort*
aww thats dumb
then its just dodge everything until he casts it again
thats cheating
06http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/
Yup.
damn I cried at this part
That big....dumb....MEANIE
3Looks like he failed his climb roll
06Ja he is.
then hit him with a combo to finish him off
just unequip all combo boosters
No, that's breaking the fight with standard mechanics.
cool!
3 hits done
Lmao I actually clikced the no button xD
LOL Crikettwb
it's just not fair *sniff* you know?
The Kingdom Hearts 1 version of the fight was infinitely more complex.
Arrest those wildebeest
pff id rather just berserk his health down and have a REAL fight
rowan atkinson is amazing
have you ever seen his stand up?
nah I'm not watching this 2 times in a day
Having around about 4-5 phases, as I recall.
daddaddaddaddad.
At least pixar movies still make you cry.
i did have a real fight...i just didn't realise people in SOLDIER were idiots :P
games have been getting dumbed down for years, just look at WoW
Uhoh.
WoW debate.
DAAAAWWWWWWWW
taboo
Fuck I am crying right now
He is deaded.
TABOO
/me is sad he missed preshow now
/me has seen him live when she went to visit Oxford.
You'll excuse me, I'll go sit in a corner now.
I am supposed to have grown up
10,2The moment that has been imprinted to the hearts of millions of viewers :(
but i like pretty much everything else rowan atkinson has done
after the miilion times I've watched it
That noo button ruined this moment, I can't stop laughing
Did anyone get the license plate for that herd of wildebeest?
not debated, just stating fact :p
Yes.
/me saw Bill Bailey live in Edinburgh
A debatable fact.
'cuz dere's been a hit-and-run
/me can handle it once. But Twice a day? He just starts sobbing.
okay we need a crying break =(
Now stop that.
TABOO
hehe :D
I know I'm too easy to drag into these kinds of discussions.
rowan is a master of comic timing
/me cries
I AM SUPPOSED TO BE OVER IT AFTER THE 20TH TIME
Be told.
:(
okay, i'm crying now
i never cry!
I'm feeling random and sleep-deprived Luna. it happens.
brohoofs all around!

/me is all T.T
07,01how come you feel random?
This is the first time I've teared up in a long time ;_;
/me is still giggling about the "noooooooooo" button
I have no idea.
Luna post show Blackadder?
/me also adds Kalisia to the hug
06BLACK ADDER

/me is wondering where Simba is right now.
Hey!

/me initiates Group hug
He's the Brit, I'm the Dutchy.
/me takes her pizza back

/me is a Dutchy too
Hi

still implying that Hyenas are dogs
its not my fault i was a noob
ahhh, memories.
The last is always the best
dat thorns!
and then all the mood died
In case you're wondering - we've had this debate before.
couldn't tell ;p
many many times :P
I think they added theis part to stop the audience from crying.
you think Kalisia?
still crying
Yeah! It's probably a good idea to let the enemy run away without killing him!
unless you come back in 5 years way bigger then you are now.
yep
pfft
pretty sure I've heard this debate before too, and not from you two ;)
just because i was wearing all whites and meleeing...
This plan cannot backfire.

I'm moving to swtor
Yes, the Vultures were going to eat Simba.

06Yes, get in my belly~ >D
swtor is too much like wow for my taste
which one is ss3?
eh i'm going for the pvp aspect
/me climbs up Zephirdd's nostril

Crickettwb: Yeah. I'm glad they never made any sequels. Just like with the Matrix.
/me doesn't know wat a nostril is due to non-nativity on English

07,01I never expected I would quit WoW...
Rafiki is G-Monkey

Epic run music.

I think TBC was the best in terms of difficulty/accessability
07,01and the vid at the Wrathgate
YA I JELLY
13Ulduar... that was the best one in Wrath.
Sure thing, Nittany.
07,01Yea, I agree
"Let's get down to business..."
Wouldn't he be running the wrong way?
lol
oo wrathgate chain was my favy
it had more than 2 difficulty levels on most of the fights, made it a lot more challenging
13The cinematics too, all nicely done.
kind of hard to change it this way in another way
But it's not a downloadable .gif

Garrosh is a tit.
Granted, if he comes back and tells Garrosh to piss off. . .

And I'm not very fond of the Goblins, if I'm honest.
NO EVIL GLOATING!
At least the Horde Goblins.

/me hugs Luna ~yay~
It's the US proposing a law. Of course they want it global.

(sorry, that was a bit crude of me, wasn't it? :P)
its to "end piracy"

OMFG
you cant tell me its impossible, because its not
its improbable
I just strongly doubt they would.
but possible
and as long as that possibility exists i have a problem
Put it this way: If you watch a stream of copyrighted content, you could get sued?
lol, just saw that one
Do you know how many lawsuits that would result in?
its apparently a 3 strike thing
Even that would be hard to get through.
is jonathan coulton coming over the stream, or is it just me?
but still POSSIBLE
ill be right back i have to empty my garbage
okay, it's just me
i have no idea how that turned on
06JoCo~ <3
especially if ponies are involved
06o:
And Espy - that won't happen.

I saw a Zero Punctuation on that.

my rabbit was like that, till we put him down
that's depressing.

Naw, he's comfy. I'll let him sit until he wants to get down.
I'm well past that.
He hasn't been part of the Eggman Empire for years.
I can't rule out sabotage, of course.

Highly likely.
But allow me my illusions, would you?

Sure Luna.

Hey FlutterBro
Hi FlutterBro
>mfw I care less about ep 3 than ep 4
DEMENTORS
yup
which is dumb
because there is only one
all the other ones arent real
The Voice Acting was SHIT. Except Robotnik's.
they play off all of the games as non-canon
everything else is a false plot twists
....
This is now trippy.
Everypony! Stop CONSUMING SHROOMS.
And how often can one character get amnesia!?
Seriously.
i wish i was good looking enough to have an attractive girlfriend ;(
but he forgot he forgot
Well, I wasn't expecting that F-Bomb at all
except he can't remember that he's had amnesia
lol
ummm
Oh my
Yeah, but he also remembers the times he forgot.
WHATS GOING ON?
And thick.
Very, very thick.

Nah, that's 2009.
2006 was just an atrocity.
Yeah. 10:21 and yet I still feel kinda out of it. :/
But with, as said, two saving graces.

One:

His plots were mental, but that's the story board going completely off the record. At least he pulled his role off.
10:22 here
Two:
07,01he's Fluttershy's brother
they have interspecies romance!
Cerberus is a shipwreck?
that cancels out any saving graces!
Noted.
BUT!

How does THAT work!?
they look kinda similar
flashception
That, or I blocked it out.
Bye then LC!
07,01k baabai!
Like I said, that entire story was a gargantuan clusterfuck.
And that's sad.
lol
and then flies up and hits the weak point
But then in SA2 you had the Biolizard.
biolizard was actually pretty cool though
Oh certainly.
I'd never be able to handle that.
do a reality check everyone
07,01So... do you guys play left4dead?

Yup.
07,01GGgala too
huh
really?
Yup.
woow
i prefer the port
an unfinished version
Well, they just added a few features.
I don't.
Some of the added features were bugs.
Quite a lot of them, in fact.
does easyCap count as a capture card? >_>
07,01yep
Probably. never tried.
i know you can in the gamecube version
I want a capture card :<

/me hugs Silvermane
he did it in the show
you need to paint it first
how did they explain it?
oh bullshit
although... with enough generations of selective breeding and pelt alterations...
thats not an explanation
you can get COLORED HORSES
At least they made the effort :P
You all have such a weird way of spelling Rarity.
/me does not get a hug in return from Silvermane?
He takes his mini-flier.
if they attached like a colar that explodes if he breaks the rules, then i could see it
It's FFVII ALL OVER AGAIN
it would get confusing
/me sobs on the moon

Hey Silvermane, hey Luna
"Hooray! Hug?"

07,01"What brings you here Revolver?"
/me hugs Luna and Revolver. It is a very manly hug.
Was pretty much a given when I bought it.
"I got powerkicked here."

/me gazes at the moon with his telescope
/me squeaks! "Gently please!"
/me flies to the moon, lands and hugs Luna
its luck based

/me giggles at Luna's Rarity quote, hearing it in her voice.
No. Blue. Shell.
no power ups?
I want to go to the moon too. D:
no blue shells?
lol

There IS an ultimate move.

Erryday I'm Discordin'

AAAH
Ever play that?
/me dances with Viola and Luna
yeah you also got punted up there.
Moving on then.
07,01"Well, Viola is a earth pony and she got up here too.. Why can't you? "

Crazy Taxi is featured.

:(
or maybe duel smgs
Sad movie is being sad.
/me teleports all remaining ponies to the moon using his shipping powers.
And a couple more.
/me hates whalers with a fiery passion
I'll stick with Robotnik's cluster missiles.
My favourite part.
06. . .
would that be shipping to the moon then?
"Now, allow me to introduce you to my latest creation."
I'd rather babel to controll it
you babel things?
Silvermane: restream from earlier
06It is a harsh movie. . .
its quite starkly
Luna is such a nice person
/me licks Luna on the cheek then Glomps Viola. "FOR NO RAISON!"

/me giggles, "llwat?"
/me hugs Luna

that's ceiling|Dumori
thats lite mode of creepy form my mind
then I do write horror
08,01dohoho
08,01I returneth
08,01hiya
I need more pony music
I only have a few 100 tracks
at best
likely 100 tops
/me needs more pony music too
07,01but some of it is crap..
but I'm sure there are more good tracks I'm missing
08,01I RETURNETH TRIUMPHANT

08,01uuughh no
08,01not papyrus either lol
08,01or fixedsys
08,01XD
D: comics sans
I really should mIRC
but right now I like my bastard child of an IRC client
08,01what are you using?
a mostly self coded
hack based of the very limited IRC support in .libpurple
bugs
it's a bit fuggly but UI and code wise
well C++
wait... libpurple
it's a real mess
Doesn't pidgin run on that?
yeah
it's basicly self hacked pidgin plugins
but I have a pidgin less .exe some place
08,01he scares me with how much he knows >_<
but I'm not bad
I take it pidgin has no built-in irc support?
it dose
it's just bad
:P
I'll stick with SSH + Screen + Irssi
08,01MeteorVenture I don't know exactly how he made it of course.... but I saw the result
08,01and the result was awesome XD
3d or 2d?
lol alright
2d I've done a few times
3d I get pissed at as I try and make good modern 3d and it's soo hard to code for
2d is way simpler
that and I get lazy and diftracted easy
3d has that annoying Z-vector
yeah
and all that drawing the 3d too
ugh
then AI is way more fun to code
I'd be a good coder if my attention span wasn't ~6ms
I like doing more backend things
on the plus side I'm now a writer, coder, fencer, physicist, mathematician and philosopher.
I think I'm the same
UI and GUI's aren't fun
just tedious
Very
I can do frontend if needed
I can design them fine
I just hate coding them
after thaty
Same
:(
/me has never coded for work
I self-learnt PHP even :P
I've had two coding jobs
freelance was bam heres a brife cod it ALL
half the fucks didn't even coment
lol
lmao
with no coments of documentaion
I just recoded it
VB?
not sure now
Or basic
Both had gotos
a few others do too
it's not bad if used right IMHO
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU
Yeah, _if_ you use it right
10Obligatory post, since there are people talking about coding
:P
it;s use full in say loops if you need to recur in an odd way
I just use foreach/for and break when needed
If I need to recursively go through an array I can use internal classes for that
:D
php not much knowledge of tbh
any more
it's all faded to the back ofmy huge memeory vault
http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chatroulette-trolling-and-thats-why-i-could-not-finish-my-homework.jpg
I've made bots for web games with it before ect
:P
It went through the whole map by first downloading the map from the server
Parsing which blocks were passable and which were impassable
(Caching these results of course :P)
Then it would systematically go through the whole map and kill everymob on it
I basicly just made a clan of bots
can;t beat it
Yeah :P
It helps I was able to rip most of siad MMO's code
and use it to make a master client
lol
I made Runescape my bitch a few times
Haven't really hacked anything
including ripping all of it's code and data
At one point, I knew how WoW logs on to a server
From start to finish
Starting with the handshake and challenge
and abuses you for dieing
:P
Best part of the first Runesacpe hack
the soical part
lol
yup
I'm glad I stoped hacking when I did though
it's got a quite nasty secen in places
Yeah
I think most of us did (at least lay low for a bit after that(

Hey guys. Look http://www.ebay.com/itm/My-Little-Pony-Friendship-Magic-Rainbow-Dash-Handmade-Plush-/150667913782?_trksid=p4340.m1374&_trkparms=algo%3DPI.WATCH%26its%3DC%252BS%26itu%3DUCC%26otn%3D15%26ps%3D63%26clkid%3D3217869397637698714
look at the price...
Damn.
300$+
A lot of money.
.____.
Thats a pretty good price on one of that quality though.
it looks good but i would not pay that much for it
I would buy it if I had the money
28 bids
yeah me too
i'd buy it if it wus fluttershy
I'll buy it at a high price.
close to
if only i had the money to buy one :(
$4002 to be exact
300 dollars is nothing though http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=170703151061
It works out at over a grand a week for makign one
being geniorus with the manhours
and assuming a full time job of making it
they howry shieeeeeet
4000$
the other one isn't 4 feet tall
but yeah 4 foot smaller one would be the shit
yeah but its alot cheaper
yeah
from 105$ to 4002?
yeah
asuming they maded it as a full tiem job and it took 120 hours ot make
that's a grand a week
really would you turn down that money
yep
even assuming a price dro
same^
i think
agreed
if they sold ponies in more franchises in the UK that would be good
Ponynomics^
yeah, uk is pretty dry when it comes to pony merch
if i do want something, i have to pay ridiculus shipping prices
same here
u should see belgium... the toys are here but not the show
lucky^
same here in italy :D
brofist?
*Brohoof
dat correct term
i want to the toystore to look at the toys
i swear i wish a clerk came talk to me
I think toy R us stocks them UK
but I'm not going that far for pony
plus I'm too broke
but its rare to find one that stocks them
x3
awrkward buying that would be
i didn't find any good one to get that far
prepare to squeee!
thats a whole different kettle of fish.

I need money I can sew

i bought 3 games this month and i have a con later this month
x3
I own $7
£7*
my bank account has 7000 euro. mom's even counting on me to have backup money in case something goes wrong
tesco sells some of the MLP:FiM toys...
My account has $130 and decreasing fast.
Family takes up all of my salary and it still isn't enough
Shitty times I say
i can never find any stores that sell MLP:FiM bedsheets
a month?
yup
I shoudl file for disability
I doubt I'd hold a none fexable job with them
i got it years ago. went to a school that drove me nuts
if i wasn't mentally disabled before i entered the school i definatly am now
i would give them my money, why dont they want my money :'(
i want plushies
i demand plushies
i pretend plushies
though I don;t really want to go though all the bull shit needed to claim disability
all those Doctors and such
not really worth it. the change of school made me lose any friend i had left
and when school ended once again
any of u have that friend from school you hang out with after school?
that was only possible for me as long as i went to school
06Burn me
Uuuh.
when it ended i barly even hear from them. tough my best pal still sends me usefull sites
and hot
maybe
it's really the least of my issues though

Wait if theres no air on the moon does that mean luna has to ALWAYS use magic to keep her breathing?
07,01ya rang?
Hi
she made a special force field that has air
Howru
06Delicious and yourself? ;3
Sleepy as a 'mofo, had insomnia most of the night
And the rest I dreamed of scary shit
Unless luna is using cyro or something
The force field made sense though
otherwise she would just fly back to equestria
somehow
08,01VioletVanilla~
i'm sticking with immortal and not needing air >.>
08,01check da shower O_O
Hey.

/me slept in the shower~
08,01XD
wow 5 server disconnects that was fun and laggy
08,01srsly tho check showerchat if ya can lol
Well its only luck that they are both female if they are immortal otherwise you would have massive alicorn overpopulations
I'm ok thanks, and yourself?
Well I gotta get back to school.
Bye
Pretty good thanks :)
you had a good day?
that is because it is amazing music

06That is great movie. . .
/me for some reason wants to have another s1 marathon... sigh
I must have seen every pony episode at least 12 times
only 12?
you're letting the team down:P
08,01I've only seen each ep about... three times
*pinkie pie style gasp*

08,01eh don't have much personal time
by 12 I mean my least fav must have hit 12 by now
oh thats ok then

08,01sleep deprivation...
Luna I got asked to a gig tonight for free
08,01mmm
sleep is for the weak
/me currently training for a 2 week no sleep
why would you do that :o
2 weeks is likely rather dangerious
yeah just a bit
hallucinate = ponies
08,012 weeks?
need i say any more
08,01isn't that technically impossible?
dude you need 72+ to hall
anyone wanna help me with my fanfic with suggestions?
i;ve done a week and a half due to my insomnia
that was badtimes
crazy ponies
wasn't by choice
I hate losing dats
it's weird
08,012 weeks of no sleep is impossible
and I can treb!
nah theres been a recorded case of someone staying up for 3
but alive
yeah
08,01....how about you just not risk it
and people have done huge amount of time on really little sleep
ooo you're the writer of the TF2 fic? :o
voyerism?
it's a form of interaction
08,01true... but still... :< there are ways to force one to stay awake from energy drinks and caffeine pills..
other wise people wouldn't have died from it
if you have enough caffiene you just become immune

06,15Yeah there's this amazing pizza place near where I used to live, only pizza place I've seen that's actually owned by an italian :P
08,01moist and delicious?
08,01Moist. And. Delicious.
08,01XD
Free signs at the student lounge = 20% cooler sign
Hmm
Then he went to uni. >_>
10Dari hurry up and turn 18 and we can go drinking in Brighton
10kthx.
llol
Speaking of making dorms 20% cooler, I recently found this place in town to print posters
10Rodman do eeeeet
Pubs are overrated, come back to the fields, yo. :P
10XD rofl dari, o u
oui^
lol Dari
06,15I don't like pizzas with soggy crust...
I'd walking there
I can make that
walk it*
Fushicon would be a good meetup xD
i can't make it to that end of the country :(
06,15Unsurprisingly, perhaps, italians make really good pizza :P
Good evening :)
i should get a cooler
bahaha
and write "20%" on it
Hey everyone I know.
And hey everyone I don't know.
nice^
but myf riend stole it :(
Awwww
I'll get another one done :P
i think it'll have to be fluttershy next
stealing is wrong = must be punished = my foot is justice
I've seen it done a few times
Seen several images of weird requests on pizza orders that were actually fulfilled.
06,15I'd just try with "draw best pony on the box"
Might be pushing it. :P
...i really want to order dominoes now
just for the pony
Heh, I already ate.
same
You'd get Dash back of course.
i could order dominoes but i am saving up cash for Fushicon and Halo anniversary
That's a weird way of spelling Rarity, dari
That's not suspicion.
Dash is best pony.
^
:P
Therefore if you ask for best pony, you can only receive Dash.
Dash is my favorite
Imagine if you ask for best pony and you get a drawing of Taste the Rainbow
Agreed Dari
dash is best pony
Being a loyal person myself...
I'll avoid promoting "best pony". It appears to be a bit of a wasp's nest to get into.
All ponies are best, but Dash is my favorite.
MFW capital 'M' for no reason.
:)
INB4 Everest.
That'll work for me denied_existence. :)
/confluttershied

08,01lots of plots
such a demanding girl now isnt she?
XD
08,01plots and showers... oh gawds...
And had twins
Makes me wish i had wings...
It was damn cold up there.
I had ice forming on me.
08,01brrrrr
And I was soaking wet because I'd climbed up a stream for a shortcut.
I would totally give people wing hugs.
06,15I should start taking pics of Pinkie Pie in cool places in Sweden....
08,01I live in the friggin' mountains :<
this is reaching epic proportions from which my head explodes
/me is basking in wondrous 60 degree temperature

It seems like Iceland.
wooo mass of messages
06,15On top of the Globe, maybe?
and yes i did lash

Grmpf.
It's in Scotland.
Anyway, how is everyone?
Pardon me. Everypony?
Geographic, or magnetic?
08,01I live in UTAH
08,01but...
08,01especially at dis elevation
I'm pretty proud of that.
For gods sake, if medical technology advances enough, I am getting a pair of goddamn wings.
08,01biotechnology ftw!
I don't care if it's for the purposes of emphasis.
07,01suddenly

Hey Luna. :)

08,01not for long!
Ow!
Pinkie stop destroying reality!
/me glomps Luna

06,15No one likes trouts?
I prefer Tuna
Well, not to the face, no.
08,01I like trains
i prefer Cod...

06,15Ohay Luna

Wooonnnaaa!
Optimus must have a cold.

Snowdon took 1 hour 34 minutes.
No stench. The splinters are mildly annoying though.
It's the tallest mountain in my state.

Woooonna! welcome back
Nevis a real hike
5,344 feet (1,629 meters)

wubble?
Still not tall enough to have a snowline
*gargling noises*
*pilfers wallet*
Should've been a BIT faster.
/me has a lot of mountains in his state.
:(
L;(

Since the Appalachains, Catskills, and Adirondacks are all in upstate NY
...maybe my subconcious wants me to read deathnote again
my bad
See?
well, the Appalachains go through, I should say.
*waves to everypont and bows*
i give up on spelling -.-
Spelling is for the week
go ahead
*NUKE*
Well, I tried.
nuke pfft lazy
*sigh*
I /could/ go into WoW to hunt down rare items. . .but I'm finding a lack of interest now. Possibly due to lack of ponies.
WoW needs pony mounts
you could hunt rare ponies in WOW
I'd resub for that
no idea if they exist but thats why you hunt
Herdmind lash
Ghehe.
:P
that would be awesome...cause when they go into running free mode they can just be normal ponies
someone might be working on that
Don't know Treb.
It's not as easy as just reskinning.
in essence
:P
06,15Sounds good to me.
Could work.
Would be 200% cooler than goblins.
Except the Horde are not evil
then set it back during the first war
That's ok, Luna isn't evil either.
Celestia helping out the Alliance, Luna with the Horde, working to bring both sides to harmony.
...to be obsessed with twilight
I come back from lunch and there's talk of World of Equinecraft?
Oh deary me.
and twilight becomes an old one
Welcome back.
I blame Lash
Yep, it does not
xD
I take the blame happily.
...goddamnit, I'm going to have to start writing a fanfic now, aren't I?
Lash lets get on it
Well, that could work. :P
06,15I think I need to go play a bit of ICO
D'aww.
i disliked ICO
And that could work Espy.
06,15Unfortunately there are a lot of battles, but eh... they're not that hard, just boring...
Pinkie as a warlock?
i would put pinkie as a warlock
Wow.
she breaks the fourth wall too much
np
Yeah it is...
every talking about food
Oh dear...
Complete with fishbowl hat.
06,15that would be Spider-Mare, wouldn't it? :P
But remember. Pinkie Pie.
HAHAHA
This is my first result:
........wot.
I'll admit that that's vaguely disturbing.
Right, tonight's raid is going to be hilarious.
Yup.
Going to break into song during a break in the raid?
...Keep the guitar close.
Why?
I got banned from ventrilo once for playing the FiM soundboard... a bit too much
Hah.
lol^
06,15Sing WWU during LK raid, srsly...
Bugger. How long'll that be?
250 secs +/- 5
06,15200 something seconds
Ouch.
tell him to join with _ at the end of his name
Oh well, I informed him on Skype.
then just /nick the name back
Eh, his internet's committing suicide on him, apparently.
Oh damnit. Heroic modes.
06,15Yeah now he can join again :P
06,15and did.
i return!
Welcome back!
thankies :)
We suffered thru heroic Alysrazor last night
Two hours of pain, and people STILL getting hit by the nerfed tornadoes
but it works best if you have a dedicated irc client
want to know a random fact?
random fact :o
I dislike wow to play but I used to do builds
I want to know a random fact.
in wrath
x3
06,15I'm gonna go play a bit, have fun everypony
full statistics ect
bye pinkie!
...I need to know commands. :P
Fact: Yup.
did the same for PvP and PvE guild wars builds
just /msg Nickserve help
get the full list of commands and such
That one does nothing.
(the help request)
humm odd
Ok
06,15do /msg nickserv help
Can you see the stream?
one sec
I cannot see the stream
Yes I can Dari
do i fal?
yes

yeah
....*sigh*
I can see

Yup
07,01what do you see?
07,01tell me tell me tell me!
Jonathon Creek
Jonathon creek
Jonathan Creek
now a sad naked clown
Bewbies
07,01hows the quality?
Fairly good.
a bit blocky luna
also why nude clowns
Hmmmmm. A bit on the pixelated side.
no stream for me *sulk*
07,01arentius
07,01and try again
Hmm.
I'll change quality.
One sec.
/me twiddlethumbs
/me twiddlethumbs?
Too pixelated to read.
Okay, I'm now registered with this name.
How do I 'log in', as it were?
Hmm.
....luna has thumbs...she is luna it is allowed
password does not need brackets
for example
Oh yes, there we go.
Why did it need my e-mail address then?
Yeah, it works.
It's watchable, it just happens to be pixelated still.
wha
oh
I concur with the others though - it does seem a bit pixellated.
ty
it works
!
:)
That it does.
On the plus side, it's not lagging.
But as said - it seems a bit pixelly. Still, nice. :)
06,15or "/msg nickserv" instead of "/ns"
nick being the reg'd/grouped nick
/ns won;t work on some clients
It's a network built in alias.
I've registered on equestria daily just not here because i'm more active at equestria
/me 's client waves
my client don't likey
its a bastard of a client
Which is a stupid feature.
the fubar'd one I hacked up
yeah
I know
I'm not sure where that "feature" is in the code
06,15So what's streaming right now?
as only half the IRC code is my own
I'm restreaming the first episode of Jonathon Creek. XD
Since my hard drive isn't connected.
06,15Ooooh, nice
06,15I haven't seen this episode in... I dunno, couple of years I guess.
06,15and here I was gonna go play games :P
You suck. :P
/me has decided that he's gonna use jawesome way too much
06,15:O
she has returned!
yes^
looks that way
06,15Yeah House is in.... not sure how long
06,15or is House on hold this week?
About an hour and a half, I understood.
(according to Luna)
08,01>;3
07,01oui zat is correct
Yeah, I thought people were talking about an official stream.
06,15Pinkius is best Piacus
it semi works
Thanks for confirming.
08,01I'm in a Pinkie mood right now! Yippee!
Uhoh.
06,15Pinkie mood is best mood!
I had caffine and I'm also no sleep hyper
Yes, but two pinkies?
06,15Double Pinkie all the way across the sky?
08,01PINKIE!

caffeeine is best ien
08,01Hehehee!
I like caffeine
08,01omai goodness!
keep the pinkies away from relentless
This won't end well..
08,01everypony is transforming!
08,01hehehe!
this is fun :D
06,15HENSHIN!
we can transform!?
:3
/me sulks in a corner with his imaginary friends
08,01Awwww
/me juggels turnips
/me and ROCKS
/me 's hair goes PFOOMF
08,01Yay! -hugs RobotPinkie-
I might just tag every pony song I have with the pony genre
06,15I need to keep practicing my contact juggling...
my name amuses me too much
Ghehe.
06,15Pony is a musical genre?
i wish i could contact juggle
I tried
i kept dropping it on my foot
06,15>tried
06,15What you do is practice for months and months :P
i did
06,15I can barely do anything yet.
i crushed my foot 20 times
xD
06,15ouch, you need to start with a fairly sizeable stage ball, srsly :P
Juggeling is fun
I keep forgeting how IRL
i have a proper contact ball acrylic 160mm
06,15Starting with acrylic is a sure way to fail, pretty much
stupid dispraxia makes everything harder
06,15ouch, yeah, that's not fun when you drop it
I couldn't catch a ball thrown at me till I was 12
06Ohmy~
Ouch.
Getting there
I can chain a few tricks together
I wouldn't say i'm great but i'm passable :0
08,01hehehe
Ghehe.
I have all my martal based skills
My skill at juggling can best be described as not.
not very flashy though
juggling is also fun
No ball sense whatsoever.
I am? Oh, thank you, you're all too kind. :D
06,15I can do 3 clubs, decent flourish with each hand
Clubs annoy me
I can try to juggle and drop all the balls immediately, if that helps.
06,15Still, I'll always be an amateur
mainly cause i can't do them
but still
d4-d100
06,15CRB?
teaching certificate
and they like to tumble and boune off you hands
I'll be legally allowed to charge people for lessons
and run workshops
06,15That's really hard, DoMorePinkie, yeah, I couldn't do that
06,15I can't even do 5 balls yet :P
in air at once and doing those visral tricks
EQD hits 50 million tomorrow woot
I don't know how I learnt that tick I must have gone eh this would look fun to do as a GM
and tryed
try a few d6
just 3
even*
its weird
they down like staing in you hands
3d6 isn't too bad
;D
Lawl
Stabbed her.
hehe
I just know basic poll arm fighting
from bo-staff to pike
hardly
Go to a public place with a friend then duel
get crowd
filmed
??????
but why did I learn bills and pikes ect
I'm also a passable warsword duelest
mostly self taught
06,15Yeah I can't do anything like that
and I'm a wanna be pro fencer
Hm, I tried fencing a couple times.
I like fighting
it's fun
Once in France.
oh yeah
Full suit + helmet.
try a 15 min bout in that
X_X
while moive up and down the peice liek a daemon
Oh most definately Robotpinkie...i've concussed myself more than once
I've spent most of today training
Nooo, the site I used for downloading MLP:FiM episodes collapsed.
as I've been out of comissiopn with survier migraines
solid aluminium cores + 100ml kevlar wicks on wet ground do not mix well
for 18 months
06,15I've gotten some really nasty bruises from juggling clubs, but I don't get them much anymore thankfully
I have scars from epee duels
Not seen anyone really hurt themselves with clubs yet
Really shouldn't have clicked that link. :P
Hah, I have some pretty good scars.
from my right wrist all the way up to my armpit
06,15They're pretty well padded, the practice clubs, but they travel at pretty high speeds
but it was from a massive friction burn
06,15seen someone get a really nasty split in the lower lip, but yeah, nothing that won't heal :P
hehe
I've had to stich my own wounds before
I haven't
-.-
was to the bone on my leg
*grin*
die in a fire....of tolerance
IT BURNS WITH KINDNESS!
healed neatly too but I did go the A&E with it
06,15just... don't use them before you're fairly handy with the practice clubs :P
x3
Ghehe.
but but but
Fire's fun for all the family. :D
has a hint of pyromania
You can't really resist it though, you have something flammable, and a lighter. *set hand on fire*
06,15lol oh okay
^owch
Well, that sucks.
firetoys.co.uk has decent prices
hehe
06,15Yeah I want a special set though... :P
you can get special sets from firetoys >.>
I shoudl know I used to have hair down to my waist
06,15Well, I'll have a look
Always fun.
Is anyone currently on the stream, or should I end it?
well...they range from £17-30 per torch
maybe not
07,01I think you may end it
07,01since no pony responded
Ok.
yeah you should end it, i lost interest in the first 3 minutes
Pfft, if you don't like Jonathan Creek, you suck.
06,15it went offline? :(
07,01lol..
Well no one was watching it?
06,15I was watching, damn... oh well :P
hay guys
Well I'll leave it on anyway.
06,15Yay! Thanks
o hai
06,15and yeah, they don't have the torches I want to buy, unfortunately, though good prices.
lol stryfe
pity :9
*is tempted
oo cool
06,15Costs maybe 10 pounds extra, but I think it'll be worth it
anyone read this yet? http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/story-dairies-of-equestrian-overlord.html
Yup.
Quite amusing.
for only £10? deffo
D:
06,15Well it's £10 extra per club, compared to pro torches
still worth it
06,15Well, yeah. I just have to find them again. Used to be sold at a Swedish juggling store
Hi everypony :D
always a pain when yo ulose them :(
the shops down here all stopped stocking juggling equipment
gotta go to oddballs now
06,15There's pretty much one juggling store in Stockholm, lawl
Evening
hi flaschen
kinda missed
:P
it happens :P
well mostly
06,15Yeah, though they can be hard to find
yeah
I know
gonna have to get the person to give me a refund, again
but I'm very tempted by a for and epee both french grip
same i could live in oddballs
06Für Tod und Deutschland!!!
06,15:O
/me runs as she launches herself off the cliffs of dover
just you know expencive sport really
06,15yay more Jonathan Creek!
Bwuh?
:z
06,15Oh wow, you too?
you have to be ambi to be a juggler
lookign at £30 per blade not including the grips ect
going cheapest
06,15Not really, no, most jugglers just practice twice as hard with their left hand :P
06,15I have to practice slightly more with my right, though
>assuming everyone is right handed
<_<
>_>
I'm technicaly no handed
I'm sure
due to my dyspraxia
you mean like any given population? :P
06,15Pretty much, yeah
evey thing I can do with either hand has to be fully taught
06,15I'm ambidextrous, used to rely more on my left hand than my right, but one of my teachers flipped out on me over it one time too many....
Lefthanded.
for example I cant write left handend but I can shoot and fence
06,15She was very religious, which was probably connected :P
I eat left handed.
;)
as they are used to the guard being on line all the time
06,15Yeah... people don't like southpaws :P
because of southpaw
I loved swordfighting as a lefty...it annoyed everyone
/me parties
06,15and they like it even less when you start out in orthodox stance...
as you can then make the leftys hate you too
;)
it's also really nice with a warsword
as I can flip my stances on demand with no real weakness on my part
same more or less with rifles
i like pony
06,15I wouldn't know, DoMorePinkie :P
I know I've done it
06,15hold the others down, presumably
as my old group calls me out to do it now and again
yeah but 7!
lol
06,15Well it's just 4 in one hand maximum, shouldn't be TOO hard to hold :P
06,15hopefully last bit of Jonathan creek before House starts...
06,15I'd think the biggest problem would be trajectory
ugh I can't even relaunch the d4 the fecking wobbley bitch
RAAAGE!
MUST KILL BOSS!
I can get flight path as I never did the tick that wide
gah
Still the talk of juggling things?
06,15Oh okay, but with 7? You'd have to get a pretty high arch...
i'm going to use the stare on virgin media if i get my hands on them
sorry bout that :P
yeah
if anyone said anything to me you'll need to repeat it
yeah
:(
a while is a bit of an understatement
/me can't even two d20's right now
hehe
*high fives*
Lawl
Suck his face off with that hoover.
06,15oh lawd
06,15...ever?
lol
he changed his legal name to "rainbow alexis dash"
I know
thats just too far if you ask me :P
fair play
it's more or less my name in my head
and its a completely unique string
I'm the only person on earth ever to use it
thats oddly cool
:P just a bit
06,15Man, my inverse cascade kinda blows now... should practice more with balls.
inverse cascades are fun
06,15Yeah, really hard when you start out though.
Mills still makes me rage
but seeing as most discorsian's randomly gen their name or parts of it
as do takeouts
06,15Pillars are the trickiest for me, just to get them completely straight each time
haven;t tried pillars....i can throw a ball under my leg in the middle of a cascade...thats about it xD
also have a link to how I made my name. http://armistis.com/en/generator/
it's a fun program if you need random name ideas
it;s very customisable you can get to much more than random sayable strings
I prefer inventing my own names :P
hehe
06,15looks good, but yeah, I like trying to think up names... or writing my own random name generators :P
Firelands.
06,15only two more parts, I think
Specifically: Majordomo Staghelm.
np
06,15Haha, his conclusions are flawless.
06,15Suddenly, silence
sshhhh relish in this unique opportunity :P

behold
I'm hunting wabbits.
Based on http://derpy.me/nKHA7
06,15love the Derpy
It's actually reasonably well done.
The heroic mode is quite nasty though.
bubblewrap
:P
didn't see heroic mode, but isn't normal half saber lash, half meteor-type damage?
Or that's how I read it
06,15lol makes sense
something to
not bublewrap >.>
It is.
bubblewrap works if she becomes a mailmare
Derpy = Mailmare in my headcanon :P
06,15Well, Feeling Pinkie Keen would seem to support that
Personally I hope they don't include any fanon.
And that's how they seem to be going.
they already have after a fashion
nothing majore..but i think names are going in some places
i doubt they'd take our entire idea of certain characters
And that's a character most likely not returning.
06,15I don't think they'll go further than the occasional nod
and Derpy...lauren mentioned her name ages ago and said she wouldnt want to take the name from the fanbase
hm
but they never said if she'd be more then that
thats the one
2,14 Ditzy*
I couldn't remember exactyl
No Val.
Derpy just seems derogatory imo
I prefer Derpy to be honest.
07,01NOTICE
07,01in 30 mins House Starts
Good point
yar i remember that Val
Gaaaah
Because it hates you.
2,14 when was this in comparison to the other comment?
But really, everypony has their own names for the ponies
:P
06,15This should be canon
let it be done!
06,15lawl, timing
hehe
xD
