Hey i had some griefers on fortresscraft and i kicked some of them out cause i do not trust any griefers at all cause i had a huge grief in my world
Most embarrassing thing is when you read a paragraph, start reading the next, and realize you don't understand it because you never actually read the first.
<otakon> goddammit
probably me though tbh

whats a anti grief?

^
well its paused my screen here
13afaik it's mostly ma bell's fault
those "Trolls" dissapoint me
I assume nothing, I merely mock all
13breaking up ma bell left us with local carriers with exclusive control over the pipes
11,01That might be the problem.
00,10saves me having to dig up logs
11,01Low competition = high prices.
11,01I don't know if there are more carriers in other countries.
I'm on my ISPs minimum level. They also offer 50mbps, 100mbps and 1000mbps, iirc
11,01US consumers are weak.
2 carriers is basically no competition.
00,10yeah you have choice of DSL or Cable
Monopolies are BAD
It's always a good idea
bad unreliable service, or unreliable bad service. Same price.
11,01The US has laws against monopolies that can be helped.
Dailup still exists?????
11,01Yep.
Oh crap thats not good
11,01Some places can only get dial-up.
13Nittany_Discord: well we have the antitrust laws, but in 90% of cases where you have one operator in the area, it's the city/county/state that said "only this provider can operate here"
11,01It's called natural monopoly.
13so literally no other company can come in and lay line
Industry. shudder.
hows is he going to get his stream working again?
11,01If it's hard to get another carrier there.
Franchise laws, right?
11,01Sucks.
13yup
11,01And low competition = high prices.
Dag nab it
I loved it
00,10xxMoopyxx I wait till my ISP is done working on the lines in the area
Years ago...

oh cool
13and the telco whined and sued

well stream it
\o/
11,01MakerDusk: Not a US carrier?
I liked both Bioshocks. I should replay one sometime soon....

00,10ok you want a stream go ahead and hit refresh for one ^_^
11,01Best go to Denmark.

11,01Or somewhere else.
Way the systems built

oh it's Derpiculties
DERPICULTIES
TECHNICAL DERPICULTIES!
13i'm still hiding from vegas though...
11,01Not just pirates. People that are getting shafted.
00,10ahhh
it's just a shame it uploads very slowly
11,01Turning to piracy or at least backing them.
13if anyone out there knows how to get an iframe for synchtube, let us know

13speaking of jon st jon, i hear he's doing voices in dota 2?
I got around 120 GIG of bandwith
in my imagination derpy's eyes are making the bass sound
13d3rb: the details that are coming out aren't pretty
sigh
11,01They're making more than losing, and piracy figures aren't even accurate.
fuck
and the DLC from it is extremely predictable
oh ffs, that games SUUUCKED though.....BETRAYEL
13sounds like singleplayer is nonexistent, requires origin, MASSIVE DLC at launch

Also, you got to use a drill. this pleased me to no end.
13it's probably only because of WoW and CoD they're still floating
11,01Activision is growing because of CoD.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
11,01Yep.
11,01Game companies are crazy.
Derpy problems. They let Derpy run the stream
I only play MW2 to hack it. :D
pardon?
13i haven't heard anything of this supposed monday malware
how does one reset dns servers anyway
Yeah
It's been down for a while
But
okay, that is utter bullshit
13one doesn't
Fourdeltaone is back up. :D
13of the 13 root nameservers i think eleven are anycasted, which means they don't exist in one place
whats an alteriw net?
alternet
00,10back in 2011 som group set up some Redirect malware and a bunch of DNS that used it
well I'm fine
11,01It's a dedicated server mod for MW2.
my computer is less than a year old
not only that
I read about that DNS changer thing.
11,01So you could have dedicated servers in MW2.
bc I do NOT want to lose my net
13considering most people are going to be getting their DNS settings from their provider's DHCP, i doubt there's anything you have to do
13if it's a case of the FBI stopping service to a DNS server, the ISP should pick it up
wish I'd known about it before tho. The most common 'net outage I get on Cox in Vegas is DNS server fail.
http://www.examiner.com/article/internet-malware-shutdown-monday-check-computer-online-advises-fbi
Having a backup DNS wouldn't be bad.
13i think i tried a couple times switching our house to google's dns but the router didn't like it much
13preferred to get everything from DHCP or nothing at all
okay apparently I'm fine
This is one wierd ordeal. Hats off to the FBI for this.
00,10http://www.dns-ok.us/
yeah that
At least in the US... it's the FBI scan site.
well I'm okay
X3
It's like when the music kicks in
You know shuts gonna go down
11,01Not verbatim.
stupid consoles
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_DQ2J-0a-o&feature=g-u-u
Ine must applaud the FBI for this action.
00,10after stoping the group the FBI took over said DNS and matained them for the last year to give people time to fix the issue

00,10that's some nice face typeing

It would not load for me
I've been hearing about people's Firefoxes acting wierd for weeks now.
wha?
it kept freezing
11,01Also, this is the first time I've heard about this malware.
00,10yeah same here Nitt
13yeah this monday thing i haven't heard anything about, not even from the tech reddits
00,10I just heard about it on the news last night
13speaking of news
oh. The FBI set up DNS servers which 200000 people are using to locate sites for mail, banking, etc. They're shutting it down soon, though.
and I have themes...
Nice Technical Derpiculties screen, by the way.
13seems to have been received well
13you probably don't have to do anything
11,01Could check EqD.
just let me try

http://derpy.me/uUVJq
13meaning it'll automatically update if anything needed to be changed
lol
13probably a lot of sensationalism around
apparetnly Homestuck spawned an anime
*Moopy has rejoined chat* hello
13it would be unimaginably hard to kill DNS
MakerDusk...what break the stream this time? whats wrong with you man...
13also
The ponies were g3
hey are you guys seeing this on screen
13inb4 "why"
yhw
it is
Por qua?
I guess you have to do it at a specific place?
the walking derpy has straight eyes
Go on.
the hair is wrong?
the tail?
her hair and tail have a different colour?
00,02Shizuka, on the derpiculty thing
00,02?
asking us to stretch?
11,01Grammar is one.
11,01Capitalize.
13the one that would cause the most rage
13pff grammar it's a stylistic thing
straight eyes?
00,02and the walking one looks like a reskin of rainbow dash
11,01"We are currently experiencing technical difficulties."
13i would lowercase "bronystate" if we branded that way
13you two are close
13but why is that rage inducing
/me shrugs
oh mai
lolololololollolol
00,02Shizuka, walking one isnt walleyed?
00,02^
13i am probably in the wrong crowd here... reddit would see it before i finished the post
but reddit is stupid
are you guys still seeing it on screen here?
it doesn't look like comic sans, though
Well, Derpy isn't even walleyed all the time.
and 4chan is the one that rage the most
13owlicious sees it~
00,02XD
13comic sans
oh. That was it?
/me flips out
00,02lolfonts
13i wanted to use mead bold for it but comic sans felt more properly derpy to me
it's readable, that's all that matters
comic sans...
13come to think of it
11,01Who cares about Comic Sans?
oh wow I forgot about that
Woot? Tech Diffs?
13"BronyState" should be in Papyrus
00,02XD
:D
11,01It should be in Curlz MT.
00,02i dont get the comic sans rage
00,02^
00,10Font rage is shortbus specal
13it's a bit more subtle but sticks way out to me
00,02entire thing should be in windings
Oh is the stream whats being discussed atm? :o
ok i think i should back out and come back in i think
Yup
Hmm
00,02no scrunchy face?
13every hint i can think of would give it away..
hang on a minute here
straight eyes?
:o
13it was an issue i couldn't solve in vegas, was introduced in the render process and i don't know how
We isnt capitalised?
ok it says the same thing
the walk cycle is nice
00,02Shizuka, walking derpy only has one wing?
Is it the fact that her pupils get clipped in one eyes where they don't in the show?
DAMMIT
11,01Yes!
I noticed that awhile ago! :D
I just saw that
13the gif was perfectly looped but for some reason it introduced three skips in rendering
If i can read it, i don't care about font too much
ya
:\
13all the fades were too fast for it
Rain bow dah
we all see the same thing, not necessarilly at the exact same time
13if i were doing it in after effects i probably could have pulled it off, but i threw the thing together in like an hour and a half
oh, that sucks
Brb guys
i wouldve made my OC desktop pony a long time ago... :(
13nah it's that the source gif was perfectly looped, but after the render somehow there were skips introduced
In some parts the eyes skip to the beat...so i thot it was intentional :D
13it's only a problem for me... and all of you now that you know the eyes skip
dem technical difficulties :D
13YOU CAN NEVER UNSEE IT
okay I lied
GODDAMMIT
Derpy is now best pony
Anthing I can do to help?
13there is that
ok i just checked the roomlist it all says the same thing
13http://i.imgur.com/nKj61.jpg
xxMoopyxx...well then read it and wait for the problem to get fixed...damn
O.o
13maybe next month i'll get back on the intermission project

13otakon: because i can
13yep
BECAUSE I CAN GODDAMMIT!
Well good night
>watching an episode of MST3K
00,10wuh huh?
eyup.
wait it is
you could.
bc that would be awesome
I don't know how
wait let me go check
brb
Lol
13i think there were two or three tracks for music, mostly for shizu-style mixing
13s/were/are
http://derpy.me/okRtj
Did derpy walked out of the chatroom coming from the right side?
ya she did
How do I equip it?
13of those i have content for i think four
let's all go the lobby!
ok
13when it comes time that the intermission 2.0 is ready for render i'd just do it overnight :3
I think its auto equpied for that one
Hey derpy stop walking out of the chatroom
:D
should be the one that lets you harvest from the sisters
13the award show was fun *liarjack.avi*
derpy is best intermission
13nah that's just my storyboarding/framework
Aha
Oh.
I chose to rescue, because, well...
I can't kill little girls.
i know right
13ja by the bay to starsfull is probably one of my best transitions
Simcity music ;)
Hmm?
13though Where The Streets Have No Name into Saihate is my best
Maxis has best music
hey everypony lets all relax of this amazing music that were hearing right now
/me still says that one part was probably his favorite
Even if they're little monsters, I just can't kill them.
Grrrr. Now I gotta look up those videos.
this is pretty good music
13Re-Development here is one of the longest tracks on the SimCity 4 OST which is why i used it
Dang now i feel like playing SC4 again...
yeah make it long to
Well... i best go back to homework ^-^
music from any sims is relaxing
Still, it's a moral thing.
:$
13http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0CF3464B4CD08038
How to go about it...?
13this is Re-Development off the SimCity 4 OST
i mean the name of it
Set up traps
have a plan
lol
nuke it with the best shit you got
http://derpy.me/okRtj
00,10Simcity 4 was good but made me sad in that disasters were no longer random.
13you'll always refresh to the start of the video/playlist
night all :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ-QLl5qjLg random music
00,10noting is wrong with it othere then no streamer atm.
nothing
Agreed.
Hm
Really, REALLY doesn't help that the Little Sister is just plain bleedin' adorable.
oh that's why there was a simcity discussion earlier
13http://youtu.be/66klKlUtJPI?t=4m30s those looking for the best transition ever should look here
just go into there chatroom just say something in there if they say anything
13nope don't have sims OST
13only simcity 4
dangit
Allo All.
13the intermission is pretty much set music-wise, still debating how to handle the area after starsfull though
00,10which Sims OST did you want?
ask them if they still have me muted in that
Hey Everypony!
hello everypony
13there's just enough time for the TechnoMix we use from civ 3 but like two or three minutes left
13have very few tracks at my disposal to fill that
I want to play sims now
how is sims fun?
13makes me sad
ya but why is it fun?
HOW IS THAT NOT FUN
...You're right, it's easier if I remember that I'm saving them.
:)
but seriously though
it's killing the sims that's fun
that's it
00,02gona reboot soon
00,02Shizuka, :(
00,02myst > sims
13<33
13myst is the reason we got games on CD
Right, done with that for now, and hopefully I won't have nightmares as a result.
13i could probably run my potpourri playlist for a while
13asuka might put up with that..
Sims has no story. Case in point.
00,02laptop right?
13desktop
13tower
00,02hmmm
00,02ah
00,02cut a hole in the back?
00,10yeah i had to do alot of work with mine to keep the temp in the 60's
00,02its usualy quite hard to make towers overheat unless you have a gtx480 or something
13she's idling at 56C now
13streaming immediately pushes to the 70-75C range
1380 if i'm trying to do Source
00,02Shizuka, have you tried taking the side of the case off?
00,02should help a little
13not entirely sure if i can
00,02CrimsonPhoenix, nice and toasty isnt it
13well
13obviously i can
13but with where it is i wouldn't really want to
Less active silicon?
13yeah.. just been too hot this week to disassemble my desk
00,02iirc'
11,01The 470 is infamous for running hot IIRC.
11,01It's the one I have.
13http://i.imgur.com/7Yy6q.jpg
13that's my world from a couple months ago
Looks like a pretty nice world.
Well I do have an antec case, I can't remember the full name of it though
It has like 5 fans?
Goodnight everyone
13yeah..
00,02probably very bad for my lungs
00,10I dont trust caned air.
00,02not sure why i never thought of it
00,02dust is less of a problem where i am though, much larger problem is running out of thermal paste
13i'd use canned air and have a vacuum nearby
13glorified power strip
00,02wow
13modem is hiding behind the dr pepper and coaster on the left
00,02clearly it needs more buttons
yup
13i like it
13yeah everything needs dusting
00,02does look usefull actually, bit overkill imho
13it's pretty old
13and it did for a few years til i finally got the main screen
00,02explains the colour scheme
13http://i.imgur.com/tv2UA.jpg here's december
O_O
13back when one of the two tracklights overhead worked
whats the story?
13it's slowly falling apart, think it's a little over a year and a half old now
Haven't published it yet but it's about Changelings and that sort
13not sure if i want to stream potpourri playlist or not
hmmmm
/me 11,01wishes for a motherboard
11,01or a working computer
Lol
13i had help on that part, but the clouds you see there were me
13wonder if either of the wom remnants would have that citybuild saved still
Heh yeah right
13i want to upgrade to the G510 but $100
11,01I made a Saturn 5 replica and an incomplete model of Yellowstone in WoM.
13indeed
11,01I have a PoS keyboard and mouse.
13http://i.imgur.com/PX3l7.jpg
uhh whut
whats lode runner?
:O
13riven was the first time i actually paid attention though
11,01What is up with Screensnapr?
13screensnapr has been really flaky for a couple months
Hm
Well, if you ever do stream Lode Runner, I'll make sure to be around. But for now, night everyone.
shmoopy...the name reminds me of someone i truley dislike..
13not sure if http://i.imgur.com/f002Y.jpg or http://i.imgur.com/Mtt1p.jpg is my favorite that i did
2nd one is best

13does not compute

13so many icons ><
XD
13>fraps
00,02woah
13>use free version
00,10if only there was some way to get full version
13still does not compute
13it's 100% improvised
i wish i could of been there
lol
13the rest was all based around building pillars at regular intervals
13the tavern is my favorite though
00,10I want pony widgets

And here's my mouse pad: http://bbsimg.ngfiles.com/1/24027000/ngbbs4fdc13160debd.jpg

11,01Can't show off my desktop right now.
13http://i.imgur.com/Szbld.jpg normally putty is maximized on screen two but i wanted to show the wallpaper off
11,01People have seen my desktop wallpaper.
11,01Not my laptop wallpaper.
wat is it?
00,02celestia only knows why, its insanely anoying
00,02Eddmario, you say that, yet compiz :P
13i found i can't use my winamp shortcuts during Source as much as i used to now that i have two monitors
13my next track macro apparently contains the "move this window to the other screen and do it in such a way it can't go back" shortcut when i'm moving forward
13rain rain~<3 http://fav.me/d56hj7a

/me leans back in his recliner
13not sure if should gm_construct_flatgrass or just flatgrass
flatgrass
13or maybe excess island, that has launch facilities
Don't forget to delete System 32
00,02Shizuka, i'd prefer there be something around
00,02i assime flatgrass is the pure flat one

netcat is awesome
netcat?
it's like cat
except it can work with sockets
I can't explain why, but I listen to certain genres when doing certain things.
For example, if I'm messing with hardware, it's metal.
00,02shana, i like the bash variables
00,02cant realy do that from cmd.exe
hmm
00,02well, i could but then i'd have to add more to my path
cmd is useful for certain things
00,02and its already 8 feet long
00,02yeah
00,02inb4 i just reboot
00,02i'ma just reboot

00,02hmmm
00,02chrome dislikes this svg
...Do I hear Bastion perhap?
00,02EspyLacopa, that you do
and ctrl-c isn't handled gracefully in the script, sorry ^_^
you need to first dump it into a file
08,01boing
00,02that all looks correct
00,02ohai Saturn
hi Saturn

00,02they never change, only add
00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, on ffmpeg thats probably 1kb/s
00,02not interested in running it that slow
can i see the delay time
00,02hmmm
00,02ws4gl apears to be gstreamer based
00,02shana, as such the java api is massive
00,02and only going to get bigger
:$
00,02shana, its own
yesh
08,01baaaaahahahaha
but I do have to put up with baby pictures

Saturn: nah, I didn't
08,01ah, okay

swedish
I hate projects without makefile ^_^
08,01and had the most EPIC of beards

Paintchat
00,02wow
00,02netbeans sucks

00,02which makes sense
00,02this is the offical java ide

08,01becuase its impossible for me to ssh on a software keyboard
00,02still not sure if this worked
00,02i'ma stop stream and try this
Thanks for streaming
00,02avconv -v 0 -s 1024x768 -r 5 -f x11grab -i :0.0+0,0 -f rawvideo -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 5 -s 1366x768 tcp://127.0.0.1:55567

08,01Barbetos: awesome!
Saturn it was alright, though we had watched the movie version afterwards, and it wasn't as good as the book
Saturn, its starting again!

Saturn, which movies?
08,01Unnr: aye

How come nothing is on?
08,01Toranaga: nothing is on because noone is streaming
I'd volunteer if I knew how.
Only mods get to stream
08,01unfortuantle, one needs to be a moderator to stream

Konnichiwa
Ouch, that looked like that hurt

How do you even become a mod?
08,01you can apply when we open up mod applications
Mkay
Hasn't that been ages since though Saturn?
Agh... I have to go to the store but I don't want toooooooooo
08,01killerpony7733: only a few months
I'm dumb now?
It's been about 5 months since the newest mods were brough in IIRC
If that's the dumbest thing you ever heard then prepare to be baffled
08,01aye
08,01about that
it's currently 12:08 where I am.
But what's dumb about it?
^This
I was never implying that.
hello everyone!
pfffffffft
Then why blame me for the implication if you know that it's not meant?
08,01ponies, chill
why are we arguing about implying?
>ponies pls
XD^
I did not mean to say that mods are only here for our entertainment.
-_-
alrighty then
08,01Toranaga: well, technically we are
How is everypony?
This is the match that never ends
08,01but we also have our own lives
Aha!
yes it goes one and on my friends
*cough*
08,01and we need to sleep
Of course you do, and I know that. That's why I said there should be more mods
In different timezones
^
the vid wont play...:/
personally, I think we have enough mods, we don't want to be like everfreeradio
Though that was a nice return on the cross volley
08,01Toranaga: we already have like 20 mods
Saturn: exactly
anyone gonna stream soon?
20 mods is alot but to my understanding this site is growing very popular.
Exactly.
technically, if the mods felt like it, there'd be nothing until BMN, and nothering after euroshow

00,10feeling rather chill
can't wait to watch it
it was 5 bucks
08,01gene wilder is hilarious
wait... you needed flipflops
no one needs those things
reserved for pedophiles
he's gone
dat autokick
lawl
/me snickers
0,5*snicker*
lol
REALLY?
08,01yup
Saturn Same
0,5xD
and having NOT read the books but it is one of my favorite movies
0,5Indeed I am!
The books don't interest me, they sound quite... dumb
I know why he cut it, but I do wish he had shown up
0,5Orly?
still, LotR movies were pretty damn faithful otherwise
08,01unless you did
08,01otherwise, you dont understand
they were as faithful as they could have been to the books and still be accessible to a mainstream audience.
Saturn: I've read The Hobbit, I've read the LotR series
films are never failthful to the books
08,01otakon: no, i mean dahl
they are always shockingly poor adaptations
Saturn: oh
http://youtu.be/09I31XwKkx0
they are not
Saturn: dammit I know of one but cannot remember it.
08,01Starship Troopers DOES NOT count
Saturn: dammit
08,01because it was a pisstake
Saturn I hated Starship Troopers.
08,01never seen or read hunger games, actually
well
Saturn: the book is fantastic
not really a movie
Saturn its just an americanised Battle Royale with less awesome
Saturn ... Needful THings I thought was alright
and more idiot proofing of the story
To Kill a Mockingbird was just as good
08,01FairysHuff: he wrote the book on which Starship Trropers was very very very loosely based
08,01mitamaking: ill give you that one
and yes, I have read the Sooki Stackhouse novels AND seen the TV series to the end of the 2nd season
which only really covers like 2 of the books
08,01otakon: agreed
Hunger Games was an alright book, and was translated to an above-average movie.
But that is just because both are classics
08,01FairysHuff: it was really stupid. it was basically written as a pisstake of heinlein ingeneral
also, this Song of a Earth Pony is really good actually
Saturn WHys that?
08,01mitamaking: oh frak off :P
NOT Hercules
08,01otakon: yes!
goddamn misspelling
>_>
no
I think myths are a bit overrated, except the Odysee
Oh fine, Haraclese
08,01GilDash: i liked it too, even just for the irony
08,01otakon: aye
Hello, everypony

music is more important.
i don't like arguing....
^This
And we /are/ listening.
English is a language that is a mix of French and Germanic
08,01"i could care less" establishes an upper bound of caring
couldn't care less : to care the planck amount , because caring less for all intents and purposes equals not caring at all
Bicycle!
BIIIIIICYCLE
11,02BICYCLE
08,01"i couldn't care less" is correct in its semantics, as it establishes a lower bound, which is the intention of the phrase
Bicycle.

Saturn, Here have some BEES
08,01i just saw a *really cute* mantis nymph
NOT THE BEES
08,01GabeMoist: i has a bees
08,01GabeMoist: y'know, my bees are arriving next week
the worst of all bees

YES!
08,01have i ever shown you pics of me in a beesuit?

08,01Flyboy: bees
06Dance dance~
08,01well

Yusss
There's also an ant that travels in packs and has dismantled entire horses

hello everypony\
/me does the truffle shuffle.
08,01Flyboy: and i keep them
OH NO NOT THE BEES! AAAAH THEY'RE IN MY EYES!
brb guys need a drink
08,01bees are actually quite docile
^
08,01unless you piss them off
Yer
Bees die when they sting.
Saturn, unless they're Africanized
Saturn: Unlike wasps. =_=
Bee's scare me :(
08,01GilDash|Dinner: wasps are bastards
Bees are fine... I hate Wasps
Africanized bees hat humanity
Saturn: Yes, I know. :D
>steps on a wasp
*hate
08,01actually, hornets, which as basically large wasps, are also docile
08,01so if you see an absolutely massive yellowjacket, it's just as likely to sting as a bee
08,01or rather, jsut as unlikely
08,01also, bumblebees don't die when they sting
08,01only honeybees
Saturn: Depends on their aggression level.
08,01AttacktheAndalite: also depends whether you're a horse
08,01bees hate horses
08,01i don't know why
it depends on how bullied they were during flight school!
08,01horses just seem to rile up bees, in my experience
Heck yeah~
Saturn: maybe its like cats and dogs
Saturn: just incstint

I SAID HI GUYS!
08,01prince-dari: do you always use the correct genetive case when you talk?
00,10dari has never heard of sacrafise meening just to make the words ryme

11,01"I couldn't care less about the dress."
08,01prince-dari: if you never use the word "whom", then you cannot comment on the correctness of language
Saturn: Genetive case? Such a thing doesn't exist
Do ho ho. :P
Now I thought of Pinkie's Mouth stretching....
If this pointless argument is going to continue, I'm going to take off.
I really want to main rairty even though she's coplicated

dammit I hear nothing
08,01to use "who" in the phrase "for whom" is technically wrong, though it's now accepted as correct. as i say, language evolves, sometimes in ways that are technically incorrect, even semantically.
The sound of silence.
there we go

YES!
THERE WE ARE!

You can't have "I could care less" in place of "I couldn't care less" though.
PLEASE!
08,01i'd have to look it up, but i'm pretty sure that the cambridge style guide now indicated that "who" can be used instead of "whom"

It's not accepted at all.

Broth?
It's still the minority.
can we just get over whatever this arguements about
BGM is louder than Vibro.
Until it either equals correct use or exceeds it, it'll still be wrong.
That's the thing, the stream sends the first audio, then digitalize his voice, then send it, causing a delay of 0.01-0.2 sec =P
08,01prince-dari: well, i agree with you that it's wrong in a semantic sense; it completely changes the meaning of the phrase. i'm never goign to use it as a phrase myself, but i wouldn't say that it detracts from the rest of the song.
08,01at least, not in any significant way
08,01also, it's called artistic licence
08,01which i probablt just spelled wrong

She's evil. She's allowed to break the laws of grammar, considering all the other law she's trying to break.
