The CMC revealed their own identities but didn't seem to ever expose Diamond Tiara. Realistically, they might face reprisals for what they did, but DT won't get any more trouble since nopony knows she was responsible for that.

00,10now if it was pbj and milk
It's just wrong how McDonalds is trying to pretend it's health food. It's meat and buns damnit! It's unhealhy junk food. Delicous, delicious unhealthy junk food.
That joke is a clever warning to kids not to overpop their popcorn.
MALK: I dont mind the weird looks - I've been collecting them since last october
/me turns Sumica into a fluttershy
<-- I wanna hear that song now
00,10I got wood

Huffy the magic dragon live with twily
Nyst: Well true that, Here in denmark though they use alot less fat in general but still junk food is junk food
HUFFY THE MAGIC DRAGON
I identify with that scene too well, always eager to correct people, even if I don't have to.

killerpony7733: yeah that's my point. Even if it's healthier now, it'll never be health food like that advert made it out to be.

Stupid nickname.
Fixed.
sonicandmario85: Delete system32
I was talking about strawberry shortcake my sister watch's it
Then you can stream from TV
^ :D
FAV ZELDA, ping me your favorite zelda game
Kandarihu: a HD cable or something like that?
00,10it's not a program, it's hardware
i know what happens when you delete system32
It's where Microsoft puts all their restrictions to stop you from unlocking troo power of PC
Woah stargate
an HD*
Otherwise it can fire lasers into space
Count-Bleck: you will see you will like this show :)
it crashes your computer
True story
/me deletes System 30
if you delete it
system 32?
/me raises the glass
System32 is where all your viruses are stored
True story
delete it and you'll be free of virus forever (that's true since you won't have a system anymore)
has anyone else besides me noticed that the origin logo and the hub logo are too damn similar?
00,10I keep all of my viruses in weapons online

Pfft
sonicandmario85: calm your tits, it's called joking
¨
AV softwares never catch all the viruses
^
And it's true that often viruses do infect system32
to all you final fantasy nuts...like me. what do you like better? dancing mad or one winged angel
Because that's where all the cool shit is stored
00,10I use 7 diffrent programs to scan my system

0,5Ohai
hi there BaconMane
dat BaconMane
hi BaconMane :)
0,5I had a wierd dream about ponies last night
0,5And I rarely have pony dreams
^
wut was it about BaconMane?
BaconMane: What did you dreamed of ?
BaconMane: mane 6 ponies or background?
0,5Alright so first it wasnt about ponies, i was bike-riding with my little cousins
0,5it was a nice time
0,5then the dream gets scary though
hmm?
im going with pinkie pie invades it
BaconMane: tell us...
0,5my cousins ride out into an intersection and get hit by cars
ummmmm
BaconMane: that is dark
:( ah man
0,5so i panic and run over, and i get run over
iv had similar so far BaconMane
i dont have dreams often
0,5and then suddenly the world is dull and bleak. cloudy. And i looked around and there were factories everywhere
Quick_Thinker: if yoyu start to keep a dream jornal you will get more
most dreams i can't even remember
does the dream journal have to be a normal journal or can it be any type of journal
0,5So i look around and I get captured by these soldiers or something
Quick_Thinker: when you write in one you start as soon as you wake , its easyerst tat way
0,5and im thrown into a camp with a bunch of ponies, and then my point of view is suddenly from a child pony, not me.
killer can i get a pmd link tthe stream?
0,5and they're like, torturing him with shite-hot metal rods or something by putting it on his hoof and keeping it there
bye
What the hell is wrong with Teal'c ? :\
BaconMane: my god...
damn stream frooze for a sec
and i missed it
0,5And then my point of view goes around to all sorts of different torture places, and its pretty dark
so what was the dream trying to tell you?
0,5I dont know, but it got happy once more
mosst dreams tell you things symbolicly
0,5suddenly the main 6 ponies leap into the factory and use their pony magic and they make the place all pretty and magical and better
Quick_Thinker: iv aways found dreams trying to tell you something hard to believe
BaconMane: hurrah :)
Heya everypony!
hi Zanon :)
0,5and then they go to the next torture camp, and the next one, and i see them on a big map of the factories and they're going from place to place making it better
hello Zanon
maybe its trying to tell you push through the pain and there wwill be a light at the end of the pain
Zanon:
0,5and then suddenly im back in my living room, with my family around me saying "Well that was neat."
Hi all :P
Or it's telling you that you're into some weird shit
0,5as if we were watching it on TV or something ><
hi Major :)
Hi Major
0,5Noooo I hate torture
so what happen to the bodys?
So,they both exist ? :O
Plot Twist
well i have to go and baby sit for the neighbors wish me luck
good luck Quick_Thinker :)

hopefully it doesnt turn into a pinkie pie episode

Hey guys
hi JakyBoy98 :)
all pyro... a success
hello JakyBoy98
what we watching?
stargate sg1
awesome
Ahahahahaha
Teal'c feels left out
inb4 still sends bomb
so how does SG1 get later on? good or bad? lol only Star Gate I saw was the 90's movie :$
Sketch_Toku_Brony: it get's better with time :)
Sketch_Toku_Brony, SG-1 is awesome until the last couple of seasons.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: just wait till you get to the Ori :)
Sketch_Toku_Brony: depends on who you asked. the later seasons played more on action than the early ones. i think it got better
huh ok
only a few 100 years
The Ori ARe freaking awesome
Sketch_Toku_Brony: SG-1 is pretty good all over, except for the 2 last seasons, at least IMO. They're not bad, they're just not the best ones I think
and back, TF2 over for me for now :)
that they replaced oneill with that mitchell guy stepped a lot of people on the foot

Meanwhile: so you are not a brony ? :\
This wasn't
If you're going to argue, PM each other about it.
Meanwhile:how about you just ignore me if you think im annoying its that fucking simple
o.O what is this epic...stuff?
Meanwhile isn't a brony? MIND = BLOWN

OW OW OW OW OW
But the guy in this scene is the founder of parkour
Sergio_Scriptor: I fail to see the relevance of that.
David Belle
parkour has been around for a long time
yup
sonicandmario85: It's equally simple for you to not talk.
Epic jump
DerpyWhooves:meanwhiles not an brony :O

04Two Towers is kind of the meh point in the trilogy for me
LOL meanwhile XD

05,15But....Helm's Deep
Everyone knows the fan club is an important part of the credits

DaringDerpy: i shal write a very strong recomendation letter to the mods then :|
michael :P
yeah
and its cool that Tolkein had more to tell then just Gondor vs. Mordor
04I don't like how everyone is so scattered and divided in this movie
Best part of all the films is pretty much at the start of Two Thrones for me

04Gandalf goes up against Sauron, orcs, an evil wizard, AND a freakin' Balrog
<@Ghost_of_Gandalf> Which one there are so many mr. mod
dumbledore isn't a maiar though.

Kandarihu: you've heard of Tenser?

<@Ghost_of_Gandalf> That would be badass
otakon: SERIOUSLY?!
I prefer Dumbledore just because he never seems phased by anything
wow i didnt know that otakon
They should just make a movie with Gandalf fighting the Balrog :) I'd watch the *squee* out of that!
Dumblewhore: Lolol dat name
I see bottoms every time I close me eyes.
Ghost_of_Gandalf: actually just the Witch King of Angmar, Saruman, Orcs/Goblins/Uruk-Hai AND The Balrog.
Sergio_Scriptor I mean everyone knows that,, I haven't watched the movie and I know that, so, but yes better not spoil it
Don't ever look down.
they made a book about that Cypresswolf. its called the Simirallion.
And he looks down.

Gimme my precious1
04Gollum just wants his sausages, guys D:
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Gollum/Smeagol is a CGI character, but Peter Jackson wanted the character to be performer-oriented, so actor Andy Serkis, the voice of Gollum, played the character in a motion capture suit. Serkis also played scenes with Elijah Wood (Frodo) and Sean Astin (Sam) on set to give the actors a focal point. On those occasions when Serkis was actually in shot Gollum was
1,11composited over him in post production.
HE BITES HIM!
ouch
Can anyone explain Gollum's origin stories for me?
Yes, MY PRECIOUSSS stream is back!
'GIMME $20'
AJIsAwesome: you'll find it
might be a euphamism Ghost_of _Gandalf
i finshed my model :3
THE PRECIOUS
04You'll find out later
04AJIsAwesome
my PRECIOUS.....
yup. Thats what makes gollum so memerable. Andy Serkis put everything he had into the role. including nearly getting hypothermia
i wonder what a slenderman pony would look like
daw
best cry ever
QUICK STAB HIM
AJIsAwesome: He used to be a Hobbit, but then he took a Ring to the soul.
:(
now back to the movie!
AJIsAwesome: it's beter explained in the third movie

doggiedoggiedoggie
whts this moive called?
oh its back
because killing Gollum would be cruel. Gandalf discussed this with frodo in fellowship
oh hey it's a diamond dog
Barbetos thanks
Pikachu: -_______-
OUR PRECIOUS GEMZ!!
Pikachi - Terminator 2
our.......PRECIOUS
Is..is that drool? Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
kk thx
AttacktheAndalite, that's a collar
The whole reason frodo can actually complete his mission to destroy the ring is because he's kind and able to do things Sauron can't comprehend (Ie. Mercy)
Seems legit.
kk
OohShiny: Okay
i thought this was harry potter XD
Gimli what was number 1?
lolz that fact
TheMaster, I see.
Gimli, what's the #1?
04"Myyyyy...sausagesssssss"
I don't believe you
LIAR!
the sound is kinda low, i have my computer volume maxed
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Gollum says the word "precious" twenty times in this film.
/me dont believes on gollum
05,15I think it was "Frankly my dear I don't give a damn"
Azuredragon: Same.
Ghost_of_Gandalf: we need someone to do something with that
!
i think #1 was frankly my dear , i dont give a damn from gone with the wind
only 20 times>?
/me has a tub of ice cream :3
thats why mt.doom isn't guarded actually. Sauron believed there was nobody in middle earth who would even -want- to destroy the ring.
Samwise: The smartest hobbit in the entire film.
THEY'RE TAKING THE HOBBITS TO ISENGARD!!!
feels much more than that.
says it twenty times? CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!
Frodo: The dumbest.
only 20...I thought I'd be more
wait what?
its actually impossible to throw the ring into mt.doom. its too corrupting.
what have you done!
silly frodo :P
Ohai SuperBrony64
You will lead us to the Black Gate - Nope!
I can barely hear the movie, too. I practically have the sound maxed.
1,11He moves like one of those annoying as f**k video game leaders.
Yup, still extended edition :D
Meanwhile: I need that screencap of Gollum climbing down earlier!
lol
Tha BLACK GATE! suddenly I wanne see Ultima
dat advanced schizophrenia
about the only being in LOTR that could do it is Tom Bomdail, and thats because he's sort of god
05,15Ultima was awesome
accepted he doesn't lead you off a cliff.......twice
otakon: That hurt my ears.
always the great eye
:O
bwaaaa
Gollum is tardis
Hey!
Gollum giving new meaning to "Talking to Yourself"
Meanwhile: but I need it
gollum is tardy
Dat split personality
otakon: And again.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Andy Serkis said he based Gollum's desperation and cravings on the withdrawals of heroin addicts.
05,15did he call him a bell end?
PitViper: :D
Lil_B: This story would be much shorter if the Avatar showed up.
Hai AttacktheAndalite :)
otakon you don't need it.
04>heroin addicts
I NEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD IT!
Gollum does not meanz it. Gollum just want precious.
<= They taking the hobbits to Isengard!
wtf? XD
Orcs in sunlight? This is heresy!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Merry and Pippin are being carried off on the back of the Uruk'hai, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are in reality being carried on the backs of two stuntmen wearing oversized costumes and a false enormous head to give the impression of height disparity.
Gimli: seems about right
dem orcs
04Didn't we discuss the addictive effects of The One Ring yesterday, too?
gollum does look like a heroin addict now you mention it
Maggots.
I'm surprised Sam & Frodo can keep up with Gollum so well, running through the rocky mountian rocks barefoot
faggots
Ghost_of_Gandalf, yes we did.
soldier would like him
its planet of the apes
maggots
weren't orcs afraid of sunlight?
these facts..............why!
CriticKitten depends, at the beginning of a game or the end ? XD
I can understand that the Urukhai are out in daylight because of Saruman
1,11Ghost_OF_Gandalf, yes we did.
OohShiny: faggots are tiny bundles of twigs
but the mordor orcs shouldn't be able to be out in day
Gollum looks more like a crack addict to me...
smile!
Remember Hobbit feet are covered with fine hair and are actually more comfortable barefoot than when wearing shoes.
funfact. Orcs are corrupted elves.
05,15Blood?

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Orc juice that is poured down Merry's throat is a combination of peach juice and Sodastream cola concentrate.
Grog.

MisterBen: it's basically strong beer
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Tell-tale signs (grayer hair, blotchy skin) are introduced to show that the Uruk'hai are an inbred set of creatures, who are already starting to erode.

The herd is on the move
Tell me your secrets rock!
Squallken, it is 7PM though

Oh yeah the actor who play Aragon is a danish actor or well sorta
Dwarfs are the best race
He's like a T-Rex.

Viggo was awesome in this movie. He really threw himself into the Aragon role
and then they danced to the isengard rave
lol Gimli falling behind
1,11<CriticKitten> Gimli is very dangerous over short distances.

IMMA GONNA MAKE YA'LL-* snores *... eh... wha?
oh hai Ghost_of_Gandalf.
YFW new zealand is where middle earth is.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the wide shots of Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli running after the Orcs, all three performers are running injured. Orlando Bloom had a couple of broken ribs (from a fall off a horse); Viggo Mortensen had a broken toe (from kicking the helmet in the Orcs funeral pyre scene); and Brett Beattie (Gimli's stunt double) had a knee injury. Peter Jackson said that all three
1,11were very dedicated and continued to film the scene, often yelling "ouch" or "ow" after "cut" was called.
Legolas's elven eyes can see many things, but can he see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch?
XD

And now my favorite line
lol

RaveBrony: Medic: "I HAVE NO IDEA!"
Saruman's patting himself on the back a little hard there. He didn't even fight with Morgoth

Sergio_Scriptor: So, ok
I love how he pronounced Morrrdorrr XD
AJIsAwesome: Loll!! :D

It's the tallest freestanding clock tower in the world
1,11Title drop. It's purposely placed in all three films.
Nooo not the fluttershys
Moredor wants More!
not fluttershy!:O
Sergio_Scriptor: That means there won't be some cheesy fun?
"I'm a Lumberjack and I'm Ok..."
a title drop is when they say the name of the film in the film
04Do the books explain how Saruman came to be corrupted by Sauron?
Stop murdering Fluttershy's family!
burn all the things!
Combustiblelemons: Okay then
Count-Bleck: not today unfortunately :'(
no problems
Ghost_of_Gandalf: not really
Lil_B: :D
eww
Ghostie. Saruman wasn't corrupted by Sauron.
Ghost_of_Gandalf money, might and virgins
New Born Orkies
mud babies
That is still disgusting
he was jealous of Gandalf
._.
1,11Agreed, Sergio.
Anypony excited for "The Hobbit"?

WILD DUNELINGS!

1,11Sadist.
Nice teeth.
saruman is amused
well i'm out.......thanks for the great time guys.......cya next time...........
05,15The men of the East?
sudden skippage?
Ghost_of_Gandalf: I think that in the book, he believes that after he defeats gondor, he can become more powerful than Sauron, thus becoming just as bad as Sauron
Bye eyesfire2
Samwise_Gamgee: yh
wait did he say france
buffer!
bye eyesfire2 take care
bye eyesfire2

Oh god, this scene.
bye eyesfire2
Too long have the ponies stood against you....
Whats the difference between Sauron and Saruman?
11,01Saruman was on the toilet one day, and Sauron stole the TP and held it hostage. Saruman agreed to side with Sauron in exchange for TP. That's how it happened.
^
11,01It's in the book.

Nittany_Discord: Invasion mode on steroids

Because he's the king.
Gimli: what really... man that would of been neat to see
11,01PaladinDrakkenwolf: I have no clue what you are talking about.

04Worm Tongue employs the tactic of misdirection
Nittany_Discord: nvm
The King is "high" on power

Nittany_Discord: Resp?
Combustiblelemons: i think that there was a film critic that for this movie he said a 2 word critic "people walking" :D
1,11I'm sorry, but that line is so random and strange, even from Legolas...
Hey, are there German Bronies here?
04I remember there being an influx of people that wanted to move to New Zealand and the government was like "No, no more people can move here >:I"
New Zealand had a whole government department made specifically for this movie

Dont anger the trees http://ponybot.net/pix/4208.png
They are for torture, though :P
uhh, that sounded wrong...,
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: As the Orcs have black blood, it was only natural that the inside of their mouths should not be pink but black as well. To achieve this, the Orc actors had to swill a liquorice-based mouthwash prior to each of their scenes.
Tasteh legs.
BRB bronies
This is why we can't have nice legs............
bleh
whats neat is to see the uruk-hai face off against the mordor orcs
Eugh

TheMaster, likely
1,11The actors in this movie were all pretty damn into their roles weren't they? Acting through injuries, swilling nasty drinks, working in heatwaves and such....
hi is this the 2nd movie ???
Dumblewhore: Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
yes Saigneur
they are pretty good actors indeed
Gimli its lord of the rings. You can only do a movie like this once
Saigneur: yes :)
Gimli: Which is part of the reason they're all so PERFECT at their roles, too.
04Well
Stealth
04Not exactly TheMaster
its been called the next great addition to english epic literature.
11,01Got pinged to hell as Sauron yesterday.
Gimli: That dedication to the role that exceeds the norm.
04After all, The Hobbit comes in December of this year
HI EVERYPONY SORRY IM LATE d:
Gimli: You heard one of the injuries frodos actor got during that boat scene? back in the first part
hello
abrony: Hi!

Why is no-one ever happy to see them?
so hat did i miss

srs business
Oh I know this joke
So a man, and elf and a dwarf walk into a bar...
BUFFER
I still am suspicous about a whole 3th part creation of the hobbit when the first 2 are as good as finished...
Sounds like the beggining of a joke
Kencolt: they are bastards :)
Gimli is applejack
badass legolas
He's too honest
Oh, the catch phrase of Lloyd Irving, protagonist of Tales of Symphonia.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) had lost the tip of his left middle finger in a farm accident when he was younger, so special prosthetic fingertips were made from a cast of his right middle finger. During shooting he decided to pull a prank on Peter Jackson. He cut the tip off the prosthetic finger and filled it with fake blood, then went up to Jackson and said "boss, I
legolas doesnt like his buddies threatened
1,11had an accident."
:O
Legolas is RD :P
04LOL
05,15lol win
Gimli: Oh?, Then my bad i kinda got a bad memory there but seriously getting a buck ton of glass shards into your food is just bad

legolas is not amused
LOL
Legolas is the element of loyalty
Gimli: foot*

1,11Davis is part-troll.
Gimli: :D

dat trolling
Good thing Aragorn took that "Diplomacy" perk...
inb4 the shipping
all but one of the fellowship actors got tattoos of the number 9
05,15Aragorn is OP...needs nerf
for their role in the fellowship
He's cunning... and a cunt
04Who was the only one who didn't get the tat?
Aragorn would be RD, he's way more loyal in my opinion
Gimli's actor I think
Gimli: dat trivia:D
/me does spy check to aragorn
05,15OohShiny Sam is loyalty embodied
but Gimlis actor spent the movie series in misery. he was allergic to the makeup of his beard
fuuuuuuuuu
My Hobbits are DEEEEAAAAAAAD!
damn the buffers
so his movie was puffy and red for years

:'(
:(
WHY DOES THIS KEEP BUFFERING
11,01This movie needs some ointment.

Just a gift of horses???!?!?! OKay... :D

11,01It's so puffy and red. :
horses are better than hobbits anyway
May these little ponies bear you to good fortune
11,01:p
=P
this movie needs to stop crying
so the reson im late is because i was watching cry of fear :p
1,11Davis was the one member that didn't get a tatoo. He sent a stunt double in his place.

So, the actor was in real pain from that?
Mah toe!
FFFFUUUUUU
Dumblewhore: that makes it even more realistic
raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Viggo Mortensen broke two toes while kicking the steel helmet by the orc pyre, and that take is the one that actually appears in the movie. Peter Jackson said that he was really impressed with the shout of pain Aragorn cried out for the fate of the two hobbits, realizing only later that it was real pain for his toes. He was also impressed by the fact that Mortensen
1,11continued acting even while so seriously injured. Mortensen later remarked that the only reason it was even mentioned on the DVD release was because he was an actor and that the stunt crew were injured far worse and pushed through it.
get those steel toecaps next time brp

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Dead Marshes were actually a water-filled parking lot, the same one that had doubled up for outside the mines of Moria in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Passengers in passing trains on the adjacent railway line were able to see Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and Andy Serkis performing on set.

i'd go!
it's a real thing
lol fluttershy is best pony
1,11Nah, bronystate wouldn't throw a convention, but it'd be cool to host a panel at Bronycon and possibly rent a room for a Real Life BMN...
funny that
The power of Gandalf compels you!
05,15That would be amazing
Gimli: that would be awesome :)
that would be epic :D
I would love it!
The Power of Dumbledalf compells you!
That would be volcano bakemeat.
The power of Sauron compels you?
Gimli: yea, watch a movie on the big screen with alot of bronystaters
Dammit, nothing.
You can do a good Q and A
so ponymon is for... pc?
or whut
Gimli: That would be aesome. But where would it be held?
04An idea had been tossed out once for a real life BMN where people would come in and watch an A movie and a B movie on a projector
ObLiCody yes it it
yay
does anyone have a stream?
gandalf, all of mky money to go to that.

ObLiCody: it's for a gameboy emulator

i'll lower my expectations

No really. How did they fall into the depths of a mountain and land ON A MOUNTAIN?
He leveled up
and now gandalf heads back to the undying lands to explain why he died

so a Space Odyssey
I CAN SEE EVERYTHING!
Ganjalf can see through infinity.
1,11...
so yes a space odyssey.
*Gandalf:)
Wouldn't the battle of pelenor fields have been far more awesome if Mordor brought an army of Balrogs?
So... He's still going to die? :'C

yay Flutterguy
Dat poem
Uncle Fluttershy
flutterguy again
TRIVIA!
This movie series had some fantastic one take shots :)
Ent poety is almost as dull as Vogons...
FLuttertree
John Rhys Davies voices Treebeard
1,11Dat poem
fluttertree is best tree
Don't be hasty, not until i've seen those street fighters pummeled to dust...
Gandalf is one of the Mythrandir, i forget how many there were , Gandalf the grey , Saruman the white , radagast the brown , one was green and one blue but i forget the names
Ents, man.
http://ponybot.net/pix/2973.jpg
1,11otakon: I gave that trivia earlier. :P
dammit
04I figured Davies voiced Treebeard
Meanwhile it sounds very similiar to Vogan poetry too.
the other two istari left for the east right as soon as they got to middle earth
Boring ass tree.
Azuredragon: That's epic.
all out of trivia are we?
/me snores*
Meanwhile: Vogon Poetry isn't dull at all. The vast majority of the galaxy wishes to hell it were.
/me is getting sleepy
Frodo's thoughts: Man.... we could travel 12 mph faster than this guy....
Radaghast, Saruman and Gandalf are the ones who were around at the start of the trilogy
Great this just made me yawn
-wha-what?
1,11AzureDragon: That reminds me of the animation from Fantasia 2000
Fluttershy always make us sleep
but Saruman fell to Sauron and Radaghast was hugging trees
I has a sad ;_;
TheMaster, what happened to Radaghast?
05,15so what happened to Radaghast?
C:
Shirelings
I wonder if Ents see normal trees the way we see monkeys.
i wonder if they packed a towel before they went on their adventure to mordor
Hush now, quiet now...
04"Sleep to morning light..." *sprinkles salt and black pepper over their toes*
in the council of elrond (in the books) they discuss how they went to find Radaghast and say that he was gone but probably not killed/captured by the enemy
i cant wait for the tree to suddenly go on a rampage and kill them.
call all the fluttertrees
D'aww, he's kinda like Fluttershy
he was in woods inbetween rohan and gondor
Nyst: probably
so he apparently just missed out on the action like Luna
SirGanjalfTheEmerald he's fluttershy
so, what exactly is a brown wizard?
TheMaster: and Gondor
Gandalf, speak up.
The Ent Councel > Jedi Councel
the wizards are like angels, they're not harry potter wizards
OohShiny: I like to think of him as Fluttershy's granddad:p
Is this Fellowship or Two Towers?
1,11Friend is asking me to take him to Best Buy to have his computer fixed. -_- How far are we into the movie?
Gandalf = Sauron technically
master of puppets!
Gondor: Does the word Scatomancy ring any bells?
PinkiesthWall: Two Towers
Gimli: about 30 %
Gimli: not even a third
they're both the same sort of beings. Minor gods in the general order of middle earth pantheons
Gimli: a fair way in. but much more to go
PinkiePieYoshi64: dat 4
Aww geeez Dx
Gimli: your friend needs a bike
Gimli: About a third.
dahell
I can still barely here the movie, and I've got my volume at max.
Sauron use to be a Lieutenant for a much more evil and powerful being called Morgoth.
LoTR is amazingly long but even so it misses out parts.
All I can hear from Gandalf is mumblemumblemumble
until Morgoth got his ass kicked
MisterBen: Speakers or headphones?
god knows how long it would be if it missed nothing.
MisterBen: you got to get Phonies :)
AJIsAwesome: Speakers
1,11I'll ask if he can wait until the break...
the magic of friendship
Morgoth is pretty much LotR's universe Satan, right?
yes
thats who tolkein based it on
gasp!
MisterBen: Ok. Do you have headphones?
DUN DUN DUUUN
the black gate!
I need headphones for thism my computer speakers don't show anything D:
TheMaster: Morgoth was the dude who created the drakons and Balrogs for his armies
Ba doop!
AJIsAwesome: I do. I might try that.
*dragons
Who be streaming tis?
Morgoth didn't create anything. He couldn't
he just corrupted

Dumblewhore: could you up the volume just a tad?
I DID
not my native languagwe
they did indeed
Gimli, I hear bad things about Geek Squad.
04The setting is at its highest, Rohan
Tolkein was very specific that Morgoth couldn't create anything. Only Eru can create (the god of LOTR)
04Sorry
MARCH, MARCh, MARCH, MARCH
Men of the East
TheMaster: Didn't Morgoth the one to corrupt or turn sauron evil?
AJIsAwesome: haha :D
oooooooooooooo
TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT
trolls!
One does not simply storm the gates of Mordor
dem castle walls
BRUMAK
TheMaster: wasn't*
lol
Gandalf_the_White: ah well thats ok then :)
dem trolls
big scary things.
dont feed the trolls!
my chat is derping
Gimli: Ask your friend to find a better computer store. Geek Squad overcharges for every service they do, and don't always do it as well.
TrololololOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLLLLLLLLOL!
yes. Morgoth corrupted many minor gods. All the balrogs are the same sort of thing as Sauron
I saw that
Ok. Headphones on. That's better.
Rohan: check your stream volume, your computer volume, and see if your speakers/headphones can adjust volume
Morgoth also corrupted elves to create orcs
Dat fail
fail
Trolls "We're being opressed!"
Gollum's in his happy place...
EPIC FAIL
O NOE
05,15Easterlings!
I still don't get this bit
thats one way down
Where was Gondor when stupid fat hobbit almost gave them away?
Human eyes?
How can they be sliding down the cliff
Yeah. Headphones make a significant improvement.
NullRadix: all at max, but on a laptop
I think those are Harradrim not easterlings
TheMaster, so Gandalf = Sauron = Balrogs?
And yet the two guards don't see anything
You've been spotted... disengaged... repeat... disengage!!!
yes. basically they're all the same thing
They're not hiding till they get to the bottom
I am now pikoRing!
Are those human guards?
Dumblewhore: it's magic :)
A ROCK?
05,15TheMaster is their a difference?
Stealth Rock
:D
That's my disguise?
Thats my destiny!?
05,15there*
and not a single lookout spotted them sliding down the cliff! Like a Boss
sneaking +100
All I see is a rock...
Elven Cloaks.
Huh? what was thay noise!
Good thing I didn't iron this!
A ROCK
dat stealth
seems legit
Well they all look different. As minor gods they get to decide their appearance
A box?
That rock is a SPAH

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Extended Version reveals that Aragorn is 87 years old. This is said to be due to the fact that he is a descendant of the Dunedain, gifted with long life. (Readers of the book knew this already.)
so whicj one is this
05,15wuuuuut
04What race is Gandalf exactly?
yup. Aragon is old
Bring his whores.
Barbetos Pinkie Pie smells like cupcakes
Gandalf is an angel
he's a minor god
Dayum. He looks good for 87.
Meanwhile: :D
Saruman and Gandalf are not humans
We WILL
04True, Aragorn looks not a day past 30 for being 87 years of age

"You have some skill with a blade?" SHING! "I'll take that as a yes."
WATCH OUT WE GOT A BADASS OVER HERE
If I recall the book had a less empowered view on women no?
If the women of Rohan learned this long ago, then why are none of them ever fighting?
OohShiny: no , dumedian , i think thats how its spelled
Rohan we do
MisterBen: smooth
Dunedain.
A long long time ago Elrond had a brother who decided to be human. His descendents eventually founded Gondor

They will have women...and children - Saruman Gusta!

WARG
it was a different time. Plus Tolkein was writing a original tribute too old scandanavian sagas and germanic stories. They did not include themes of female empowerment
Aye. Wargs.
04Oh yeah

Samwise_Gamgee: yea
we'll kill your men and steal your women!
SARUMANS A PEDO

04Andy said the water was so cold he almost got hypothermia
goo gollum :D
Because. Duh.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: For one shot where Gollum is crawling and splashing down a river after a fish, Andy Serkis was actually in the water. It had been snowing the previous night, and the snow had melted, but the water was still freezing cold. Peter Jackson was worried that Serkis would forget about the cliff due to the cold and would fall off so he put two crew members near the edge
1,11to stop him in the event that he got too close.
Worgs are ... not unlike Dire Wolves, but more vicious
TheMaster: Shield maidens, Valkyries and such
Because he's evil, Frodo, you fucking moron
He is having a whale of a time :D
Norse women fought plenty often
And Smeagol is able to swim in water not even a foot deep
damn that is some dedication
He is so cute that's why
He's full of evil.... like your father......
NOTHING
WATCH YOUR WORDS, BOI
Yes, but Lord of the Rings is more Beowulf then Nibirngun (or however its spelled)
giant hyenas
Mr. Frodo, you're yelling at me
Sam has more intelligence than you, Frodo. >_>
The ring makes him a nice guy?
It's because you're bi-polar, Mr. Frodo.
Beowulf has...very few women
the ring is a horcrux
frodo is mad
sam is the real hero of the story.
pikoRing: of course :)

TheMaster: Beowulf had to fight grendels mother too

04Good camera tricks here
NO YODA! DON'T DO IT!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Andy Serkis was pitched the role of Gollum by his agent, who rang him up and asked him if he wanted to do three weeks' voiceover work in New Zealand. However, Peter Jackson was so blown away by Serkis' audition that he decided to have him perform the movements for Gollum as well.

SNAP OUT OF IT!
how far away is the battle for Helm's Deep?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Andy Serkis said that he based Gollum's voice on the sound of a cat coughing up a hairball.
where is Spike when you need him?
:'C
Who're you.
Golum has been warped by the ring. Smeagol is the original thing that gollum once was
Gimli: Sounds....about right
Poor Smeagol.
so he's a little crazy
ME!
PinkiePieYoshi64: Gollum clearly has a split personality disorder
Just a guy who plays the sax.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Gollum's pupils signal his frame of mind. "Treacherous Gollum" has narrow pupils; "friendly Gollum" has slightly wider pupils. This is most obvious in the scene when the two sides of his personality struggle with each other.
Err...used to.
Oh hey Alex.
Oh hai =P
Poor smeagol
Just popping in before I get my hair cut
TheMaster: "Little" is an understatement:P
....I see it. That's really clever
As for how far Helms Deep is...a while, I think.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Gollum spits in disgust at Sam's cooking of rabbits, that is Andy Serkis' very own spittle flying through the air. Serkis lists that scene as his favorite from all three films.

When this movie was new, I heard a hiphop mix of this on YTMND
Wrrrrrrrringling!
Smeagol isn't quitea hobbit
raaar
yup he is a hobbit
05,15I've never had rabbit
he's more like a ancestor to hobbits. Smeagol is 500 years old
1,11Huh...That was an almost-civil conversation between those two...
04Smeagol was a hobbit
rabbit is pretty good actually
dink.
He used to be a Hobbit... But then he took-NAH
Samwise_Gamgee: It's alright, but not very filling.
usually use this nick with the lightIRC embed if I want to check up on chat and I don't have much time to be on it
I've had rabbit. It's not bad, but lacks many nutrients.
then the ring turned him into gollum
i don't like rabbits so i can eat them.
Evil men!
I remember when that was on Albino BLack sheep.
Mr. Frodo... the Ding has landed....
Ninjas!
Gandalf_the_White: not exactly but close
Fair enough.
TheMaster: are people from 500 years ago not human?
:O
Im getting tired sitting here
Middle easterners
To be honest, I've always wanted to try rabbit
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Andy Serkis drank bottles and bottles of "Gollum juice" (a mixture of honey, lemon and ginger) to keep his throat lubricated for his intense vocal performance.
the easterlings
pwny: Then.... Sit somewhere else.
raaaaaar
Gollum was actually a stoor. A pre-sort of hobbit
Just because they're easterlings don't mean they're evil. Smeagle's just racist

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The role of Eowyn, the White Lady of Rohan, was first offered to Irish actress Alison Doody in December 1999, who had to decline the part because she had just given birth to her second daughter. Miranda Otto then auditioned for the same role.
you can stop being an elf. Arwen is actually Aragons distant cousin
Technically, that means Arogorn is related to Elrond, and so he is related to Eowyn. 0.0
he's gonna wake up
Elrond had a brother who decided to be human instead of elf
04My word
awwww
and thats arwen. Eowyn is theodens daughter
If you sleep in a dream... then....

Yes, they're cousins about 20 generations removed.

eosforos: Hi!:)
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Warg attack against the Rohirrim was originally supposed to be set at night, and at Edoras. After working on the Edoras set during the day, Peter Jacksondecided that it was too windy and too cold to bring cast and crew back for a night scene, so the scene was re-written to happen during daylight.
Uh oh....

DANG
Hi it is Two Towers
Canadian_Brony: Hi!:)
that has to heart
That scout is a spy!
Canadian_Brony: are you from a blog?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Although Wargs in the novel are described merely as looking like wolves, the filmmakers decided to add in elements of hyenas (which are not members of the wolf/dog family) to their build, to create a uniquely fearsome appearance.
she's one of the oldest beings in middle earth
they've killed the Diamond Dogs. Those bastards!
Dat epic music!
05,15What about Tom Bombadil?
Tom Bomadil is...probably god
my stream is a slide show...

Tolkein wasn't clear
Michael . . . no. I'm from Canada.
Legolas is like: TARGET: ACQUIRED
Wolves are scarier than hyenas imo
Either god or the personification of Middle Earth as a whole.
Suddenly this reminds me of the mountain figh scene in Mulan...
Probably
isn't that the same thing?
Tom Bombadil is Tom Bombadil:P
Tom Bombadil is the only thing uncorrupted by the ring. and tolkein said no being of middle earth couldn't be corrupted.
Canadian_Brony: i mean do u write something in a page named screwattack?
Legolas uses Premptive Strike! It is super effective!
So he's probably Eru
God = the Universe as a whole
Wargs? Huh, now I know where World of Warcraft got it's worgs from.
this is reminding me of Narnia, the war at the end of the first movie

Elves have 20 dexterity

Wolves have a very different build, though, and almost a graceful appearance in some cases. Adding a touch of hyena works here because it really does make them seem beastly and brutish

Well you can
Besides, it's all soulbound anyhow.

ShadowQuill: Cool! What is it?
/me hugs araagorn
Samwise_Gamgee: It's fine when you can ensure the enemy will not breach your defenses, and assuming you have a way out. But that's not how this is set up.
O.O
I have to turn them all the way up to hear what's going on.
lord of the surprised face.
WAIT YOUR SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD

Okay.

AJIsAwesome: I have no videos yet, but my account name is ShadowQuillSecond
Is it safe to assume that the intermissions are being placed at the half way point of each movie
Kandarihu: Try using headphones.
she looks tired
dat drain
i smell huge fighting scene...
the problem with turtling in a castle is food. In the medieval ages, it was a tactic to starve the enemy out.
Riders: yes
sharklion: You could say he's.... HEAVYILY ARMED!
idiot
our only weakness is this hole we dug into the wall. might as well give them a fair chance
have no fear. there is plenty of movie left to go
Kandarihu the movie is really quiet actually. I tried using my speakers, but went back to using my head phones.
ShadowQuill: Me neither. I usually make comments on videos.

Because Sauron uses Science and it's evil!
:O WERE SCREWED
"wow, i did not see that coming"

Pony: "GET THE FUCK UP, no time to be sleepin' boy."
How does the horse know he needs to get to helms deep?
Close enough.jpg
Agent Smith grew his hair out
Fl00tersh41: his horse is amazing
Colt_45: GIVE IT A LICK!
Remember kids..........FRIENDSHIP ALWAYS SAVE THE DAY!
would have been awfully embarasing if it took him to edoras
05,15why are we whispering?
That horse just can't feel like a horse without about 150-200 pounds on his back.
Oh hi Fl00tersh41 :)
hah. flootershy
that would beprettyfunny
There is always hope
Colt_45 it tastes like raisins
and then he beat her.
...
Sergio_Scriptor: sup
Fl00tersh41: Hi!
How old is Arwen?
Fl00tersh41: what took you so long ? :D
Arwen is probably several hundred/thousnad years old
I heard Agent Smith there made a lot of money that year. Being in the matrix and LoTR..
as are pretty much all elves
Been here since Gandalf the white showed up
TheMaster he's 87
ooops
Arwen, not aragon
Samwise: Because it's night, and walls in Rivendell are paper-thin
that is wrong
read aragon
sorry
I AM OFF TO WATCH PONIES
arwen is pretty young
Then he'll be Aragon the White!
she is about 25
:'(
Fl00tersh41: O_o holy crap you are a ninja
that is when all elves
arwen is 3500 years old
what movir his is 2 ine ?
:'(
>_>
it's The Two Towers
/me hands fluttershyFTW a tissue
considering he is 3000 years old, 25 is pretty much straight out of the womb isnt it?
05,15Sexy Cry
just saying
05,15ONLY ONE TEAR ALLOWED
She is 3500 years old? That cradle snatcher!
*Sexy Cry Time*
Sergio_Scriptor: I and my pirate ancestors deeply resent that comparison!
:(
Fl00tersh41: well then i will say this only now :"Welcome " :)
but she didnt in order to stay with aragorn
Going after a poor young 87 year old
Ryunosuke: they live a long time, they mature at teh same rate as a human
not 25 250
im not crying im sweating through myeyes
Samwise_Gamgee: OOh! I just saw a 2nd tear!
2 TEARS

Fl00tersh41: :D well you had the european ninja,the berserkers :)

:P
NAILED IT!
and off the elves go to the undying lands
....
sparkle sparkle sparkle
NOOOOOOOO
Sparkle, Sparkle, SPARKLE!
let the sex jokes begin
Sergio_Scriptor: Berserkers don't sneak up on their victims nor dress in silly pajamas
DONT DO IT
If elves live forever there are no elf years
otakon: "You, your mate and your johnson,"
Elrond stays to watch the war
This music reminds of Night Elves from WoW
FUCK YEAH SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE!
XD
Fl00tersh41: :D true...
Unless you kill them first, then there are elf years!
wait, if arwen is 3500, that would mean that elrond is at least 4000, possibly as old as .... OVER 9000
The elves are rage quitting middle earth!
Hope you've seen his reading of 50 shades of grey. it's hilarous XD
damn french people
in LotR
They probably barely realise time passes
Well the elves had a lot of grief in middle earth
Dumblewhore they say that elves live forever because normal people never seen elves dying from advanced age
Combustiblelemons: He read fifty shades of grey?!:D
They must be fed up with Saurons hax
In a stunning twist of fate, it turns out that the Undying Lands were actually Antartica. That's why there are no elves left.
:O THE DARK BROTHER HOOD

EYE SEE YOU

Combustiblelemons: :D:D I have to check it out!
MrBen: EYE SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE!
they did impressions of droopy dog, mickey mouse, the monarch and zoidberg
it was epic.
Where was Gondor when Gondor was asked where it was?
:'( nooo frodo is going to die
or is he
Everyone dies.
fluttershyFTW I doubt it, he's a hero
and he's the protagonist
why are men always the dicks in fantasy?
Riders Yo dawg I heard you like Gondor
Combustiblelemons ohh, NC reading "50 Shades of Gray"? LMAO!!
yup
well Faramir has some daddy issues
OohShiny: so was gandalf
sharklion: cause...Humans
sharklion: Because men are dicks in real life
That huge EYE
it's as hilarious as it sounds
cratorkid he did not die
Nicolas Cage . . .
TOOTHLESS
Pfft I've heard a better reading of 50 shades of grey
nicolas cage was hilarious
Elrond and Arwen are half-elven. Earendil (man) wed Luthien (elf) and had 2 sons. Elrond who chose elf and Elros who chose human
OohShiny: he did, he just came nack
They guy who voices the parrot in Alladin
yes
:P
"spread your legs baby"
gilbert gottfried reading fifty shades of grey will get you aroused in an instant
Dumblewhore oh gawd
Dumblewhore: Gilbert Gottfried
Dumblewhore: Could you PM it?
cratorkid because it's the protagonist power
Buytoast: FUCK NO
there really isn't such a thing as 'half elf' though.
elf is more a status then a race
Dumblewhore: He was the guy who did the Aflack duck too! :3
sharklion: because the idea of fantasy is to imegine worlds that have perfect sutff in it. and men arent perfect. it's al in the comparison
he has the voice of an angel
okay, the HELL is "50 Shades of Grey"?
05,15Gilvert Gottfried read 50 shades of grey? Oh hell yes
search for it on youtube
Buytoast: if it smoked 20 packs a day
Samwise_Gamgee: It was so many levels if hilarity
50 shades of grey = twilight porno fanfic
OohShiny: what about sean bean? sure he not the MAIN protag but still
fine I'll look it up
otakon: It is some stupid smutty book
brb
Dark_Horst: not sure if many fantasy worlds have perfect settings. seems to be a lot of death and destruction.
otakon: A revised fanfiction of Twilight based around sex and bondage
cratorkid if he's not the main he can die
otakon: a fanfic of a 14 yrs old wet dream
Could you guys stream that? That'd be hilarious!
05,15Twilight porno fanfic that was published and out sold Harry Potter
05,15HARYY
The goblins will strike hard.........Im not even going to say anything
i kinda died a little inside when i found a copy in my roommates' bedroom.
05,15POTTER
wait. 50 shades of grey outsold harry potter?
otakon: That was actually published
If Gondor is weak, why isn't Mordor attacking them earlier?
WAIT WHAT!?
Samwise: Wait, what?
my mom read that book and it's sequel
Samwise_Gamgee, PLEASE tell me you're kidding.
Samwise_Gamgee: wat?
whatis wrong with people?
Wut
...
IT OUTSOLD HP!?!?!?!?
It outsold Harry Potter?
NOT POSSIBLE!
^
No way
Samwise_Gamgee: Which part?
dafuq
i didn't know fifty shades of grey had two sequels
until then
IS NOT POSSIBLE!!
IT OUTSOLD HARRY POTTER!?!!!!!:O
Buck was awesome!
O_O
its poorly written porn. I could write much better
sharklion: not settings. elements. elfs for example. they're there for the sole purpose than having something better in there
what outsold harry potter?
Fuck that
twilight?
IMPOSSIBRU
wtf
Considering, HP is the highest selling book series ever, I doubt that
read this and you'll see what it's all about
05,15The series has sold 40 million copies worldwide, with book rights having been sold in 37 countries, and set the record as the fastest-selling paperback of all time, surpassing the Harry Potter series.
http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/50+shades+of+wtf.+not+mine+found+it+funny_1898d3_3870795.jpg
Everyone go out and buy more Harry Potter books now
/me I DON'T WANT TO LIVE ON THIS PLANET ANYMORE
Maybe a single book
I can write better then 50 shades of grey.
This can't stand
Dark_Horst: fair
And chat became butt hurt about Harry Potter.
Buytoast: I'm only aware of Fifty Shades Darker.
OohShiny: Fifty Shades if Grey
My... brother.
50 Shades of Gray is a Twilight fanfic?
omg
Oh, ok fastest selling
not most sold
Samwise_Gamgee: Funny, 50 Shades of Grey actually showed up on the Nostialgia Critic episode :P
i believe a third one is either being made or is out
My Boromir are dead!!!
It was the FIRST entry when I started typing
it was originally a twilight fanfic
AJIsAwesome never heard of it
the twilight series fanfic.
I'm scared
....
this
Its target market is 40 year old women
Kandarihu: Twilight Style fanfic
is
the names were changed later
bad
i dont get why is 50 shades of gray any popular,when any well written clopfic can do much better :|
OohShiny: You don't want to read it.
*insert Spy joke*
I think we should stop talking about 50 shades
^
I'm reading rainbow factory to my kids.
one day.
rainbow factory is not scary, read them cupcakes
As long as it's not MLD.
don't read that trash to your kids
cupcakes isn't scary either

SEAN BEAN!
TheMaster Cupcakes is scarier than Rainbow Factory if you ask me
Combustiblelemons: Maybe that's a good thing.
theres only one moment where I winced with cupcakes
:O
XD
brb
Combustiblelemons: you will be >: D
there's a difference between scary and torture porn. for example, the saw films. not really horror, just gore porn.
cupcakes is just gore
maybe.... maybe....
Sean Bean's only role in this film: playing a dead body.
yay boromir
oh hey its ned stark
How far are we in?
MrBen: what now?!?!?!

It's so difficult to know when it's a flashback.
*FLASHBACK*
I really like these flashbacks, as they show that Boromir was really a good man before the ring began to affect him.
Looks like he was breaking 4th wall.
*RACCONTO*
Fartherly love at it's finest
04Boromir was a good man even before his death
05,15Well, to be fair, Boromir totally redeemed himself
Hey if Gondor surrenders what colour flag do they put up?
Something tells me he doesn't really like his other son.
Fluttershy flag
05,15almost immediately after trying to hurt Frodo
Boromir, Faramir... Their dad wasn't creative at all
Meanwhile: black ?

USE THE RING AND GET THE BUCK OUT OF THERE!
using the ring is a bad idea
otakon: But then the shadowbolts will come D:
dont do it
it would draw every evil thing ever to him
ring is a piece of shit... just makes you invisible
Taking him where?
00,03lik dis if u laff evertim~
TO DISNEYLAND!
can't blame the dad for not liking farimir, he's an asshole
it only turns hobbits invisible
Scoot-Scootaloo: -___-
TheMaster: using rings is ALWAYS a bad idea :|
scumbag one ring
-_-
TheMaster: turns everyone invisible actually
beings powerful enough to wield the ring wouldn't turn invisible
precious`
ze ring has taken you!
sauron wasn't invisible
OohShiny: It's a powerful weapon, you just need to know how to use it
I don't get it. Why would every evil thing become drawn to you if you became invisible?
And no one ever liked this guy ever.
and gandalf and galadriel wouldn't turn invisible
dont do it
because the ring is alive
AJIsAwesome: it's like lighting a beacon
in Soviet Middle Earth, ring puts on you to turn invisible
the ring is basically saurons soul
TheMaster: Sauron wore mega armour
otakon: Ok.
SirGanjalfTheEmerald they didn't show any ring power actually
AJIsAwesome: magic :)
brb need to check baking potatoes
just invisibility
Wait....
The ring.....
otakon: Never saw LoTR before.
it makes me sleep...
Haoaoaoao
The ring always seems pretty useless
:s
in Xbox360
oh this wont end well
I have to pay, to use the marketplace?
did someone put that tape in with the static?
YOU DONT UNDERSTAND
it's his precious
LEAVE MASTER FRODO ALONE
The ring is alive, its saurons soul and only beings able to use it wouldn't turn invisible. Hobbits like to hide and not be noticed, thats why -they- turn invisible
I need gold membership to use the marketplace?
The Mountain....of DOOOOOOOOOOM!
Turning invisible wouldn't help you destroy the world
One does not simply . . . oh who cares?
AJIsAwesome: niether have I
no non-hobbits wear the ring so we don't know what they would do if they wore it
TheMaster: Isildur turned invisible in the flashback.
what happens when men wear it
You want the Ring? Take it.... then a crazy fill will soon crawl out of your television... breaking your fourth wall... then all of the things you have become.... shall vanish....
Canadian_Brony: I do......
dat army
TheMaster: I see your point
that would be the movie though, I don't recall that being mentioned in the book
O_O
ze ring
They die in 7 days fluttershyFTW
AJIsAwesome then you finish it.
and even if it did.isildur was trying to get away from a ambush at the time
well, if I get the ring I would be what... I am a pacifist. Maybe I get iron skin or something.
I'd like a peanut butter and ice cream sandwich right now
fluttershyFTW: destruction happens
OohShiny: They don't really need too. Everyone probably realises how poweful it is. Think of it as a LotR version of Nuke. One random person couldn't do anything with it. In the right hands however...
-_- really
sorry couldn't help but make a the ring refeence.
7 days....
:O the girl that comes out of the tv is actually the rings owner
Canadian_Brony: One does not simply look at that scene the same way again
fluttershyFTW: yep :P
And Isildur was still a human. A minor god like saruman or gandalf could tap into the rings power just like sauron
Good pony!
The Ring?
OohShiny: And then everyone around you would be like "Ooh, shiny!" Do you see what I did there?
good horse :)
SirGanjalfTheEmerald no such thing as "In the right hands" for the ring
pikoRing yes
dat dwarf
05,15So what do you think Gollum's allignment is. Chaotic Neutral?
*gathers around*
Gondor is no place for a pony
Samwise_Gamgee: Neutral Evil
sauron is a
GIRL
he is alive! i'm gona kill him
okay.jpeg
Samwise_Gamgee, both evil and neutral.
whoa he sounded like a guy
Canadian_Brony: Well Sauron's hands are "right hands" probably. From his point of view:P
XD
Has Helms Deep started yet? Or did I already miss it?
Samwise_Gamgee: he looks out for himself for the most part, but willhurt/kill others to get what he needs/wants.
no
helms deep is going to start soon
magmablock: bot yet
great
soon being relative
its almost here
soon
yay
O_O
dat scene
like a baws
Samwise_Gamgee: chaotic evil, he doesn't care about others or rules of any kind, only what he wants
LIKE A BOSS!
the return of the king
04Here it comes
I reenacted that scene once IRL
FAEC ZOOM
10,000...

over 9000
DRAMATIC POSE
fluttershyFTW: foreshadowing!
dun dun duun

Gandalf_the_White: Here what comes
04I hope Meanwhile is around
OVER
10k...
This bit is awesome
9,000!!!!!!! D:
LET THEM COME
Sauron's eye is red and dry, maybe he'd be happier with Clear Eyes.
I think 10,000 could destroy the world of most things
:O
WHY WOULD YOU PING ME
Every man and strong lad
How long is the director's cut for Return of the King?
What 9000!
Meanwhile: bc we like you
10,000 is a small army

goddamit, I think i missed something
Ping Meanwhile?
because it torments you Meanwhile
Like, 5 hrs.
Dumblewhore: nowadays yes
WAAAAAA
An army 10,000 strong? BRING IT ON
Dumblewhore IKR?
05,15Riders like....5 hours
why would we ping meanwhile?
i think i remember the battle in the ps2 game, defending the walls and stuff.
everyone, ping Meanwhile
Dumblewhore: when the population is only 100K it's a big one
pinging Meanwhile would be mean!
/me puts on glasses
dat quote
Very descriptive, Gimli.
we should ping Meanwhile for the precious
/me pings that cinderblock-throwing person in the chat
Gimli is NOT happy
we need chucknorris
They are all elitle class with high level equipment
Gimli knows
"THEY HAVE BIG ARMOR. THAT MAKES THEM BETTER THAN NORMAL ORCS."
are people pinging you meanwhile?
fluttershyFTW: :D indeed
CriticKitten: That's what Legend of Zelda taught me.
well saruman did enhance the urukhai
CriticKitten: have you seen the armor of the typical Orc/Goblin? it's scraps
allright... who's pinging Meanwhile?
so they are sort of better then regular orcs
stop pinging him
somepony_else: you
too much buffers
IDKY but mt toast tastes like chocolate
saruman used magic to enhance the urukhai. they're superior to mordor orcs but he has less of them
somepony_else: Everyone but me. I like being alinve
we need a hero
alive*
psst^^
Turned my ping off...much better.
otakon: That's because Sauron is a cheap bastard
CALL UPON THE SEAPONIES!

If they had flamethrowers back then, the ents would probably think twice.

Don't cross the memes.
sharklion that's emotions

Where was Gondor when only Two Towers was worth it for memedom.
Anyone speak Elvish here? :P
Canadian_Brony: :D

Canadian_Brony LotR taught us about teamwork
I am fluent in klingon and elvish
"they are going to die" basiclly
I only speak Halfling.
I only speak Elven, not Elvish. Sorry.
Dat lighting.
legolas says that theyre doomed
00,10funfact, the program they made for the upcoming battle had to be midified to alow the defenders a chance
Dumblewhore: not sorry,i dont speak the language of Elvis Presley
The are noob feeders"
Dumblewhore: preety much "this is folly" " i dont care"
This shot is so DAMN cool!
that speech
I wish I could speak Elvish
Don't be Elfish, share what they are saying
I'm surprised Orlando Bloom never quite took off any further than he did after these movies.
and theoden really is the most depressed man i have ever seen in a movie

The children must not fight...
Canadian_Brony: lol
You're in the army now

Cupcakes, don't be too hasty
OohShiny: I'm surprised there were any Spartan's at all
It looked AMAZING when I saw trailers of it a year or 2 ago
otakon Kandarihu IKR? We all got to draw the castle, but I finished my other projects early, so I got a head-start. IIRC, I got an overall mark of 44/55.
WHICH SHOULD BE ANY MOMENT NOW
Yeah, take your time Ents. It's not like world coming to an end or sth
Canadian_Brony: nice man

Combustiblelemons: (\
Aragorn is the sort of guy you'd want leading your army.
hai sonicrainboomer259
Okay WHY isn't Gimli packing Dwarven Chainmail?
That sword is bad and you should feel bad!
Ther's always hope... you just have to Pony up!
Deeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaad.
05,15I have that sword
I just figured something out. Ded spelled backwards is... ded.
And that scene really solidifies that fact.
CriticKitten: he IS the One True King
hi sonicrainboomer259

YES! YES!
otakon: because hes packing dwarvel plate
lol
ohai MASF123

Hello sonicrainboomer259! I love you!

Hi Pinkies4thWall

Gimli gains huge chainmail +5 defence -3 agility.
he said hes forgiven

Samwise_Gamgee: full scale or letter opener?
05,15woah
hi Pinkies4thWall

04Ah shi
Bye-bye sharklion, love you!
Gotta love 3 way bromances
DA HORN
Yay elves
Dat horn....
Elves!
WHAT A TWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEST!

BILLY BROUGHT THE ELVEDS!
Samwise_Gamgee: moice
And then suddenly archers
Allies.... :D
04*ahem*
*cue Imperial March*
*noice
Gimli gains +5 defense, and for being a Dwarf he gains extra +2 defense for every armor he's using.
That's a lot of level 20's.....
04Maybe not, but still, the elves honor the old tradition
LOL This is bringing back Warcraft 2 matches with my buddies. ;_;
The elf army here wasn't in the books, right?
05,15Also if I recall correctly. In the books only men held Helm's Deep. The Elves didn't join the fight
too bad they're only using Masterwork gear
aww i was expecting chuck norris
for a sec, I thought I heard a part of "Meet the Medic"
impossibru!
Look at this, Where was Gandalf when Rohan fell!?
Samwise_Gamgee: yh elves didn't show up
yeah they fibbed this part
Fl00tersh41: yep
it's a nice addition though
Id spam night elf archers until i could build an army of tree ents
and it does not feel out of place
So why did they add them into the films?
brohug
hugs
I didn't think there would be enough elves in middle earth to fight in this battle anyway
Dumblewhore: no idea
...
Becuase elfs are pretty to look at.
IM A HALF-ELF
04Because friendship, fuck yeah
04That's why
because it makes it more likely that the defenders survive
TheMaster: not for a whole army, but a division of archers is useful
elves*
Dumblewhore: Because Peter Jackson has a hardon for elves
so are the other dwarves all dead?
Dumblewhore so they could get tall people with long blonde hair into the film
It makes a better movie...
or what
dat march
Question: How much food do u think an army like this needs a day?
Because Pinkie Pie!
Mainly because in the books the elves wre busy fighting off Sauron's forces on their own front but obviously this can't easily be portrayed in the movies so instead they had the elves join the army at Helm's Deep.
LoTR is like the longest movie ever
Hey isn't that the bad guy from Pirates of the Caribean? The East India Trading company guy?
PitViper: thanks :)
the quiet before the storm
Oh shit
it appears that some of the mods have changed thier names into LOTR and harry potter names o_e

It's like watching every Bioware conflict in existence if the people involved weren't petty
they are approaching!

gim li is so small
Oh, yeah. I love this battle.
I loved this line

gimli*
MDL: good times indeed
of course it rains
"Get the dwarf a box."
otakon: Especially elven archers
could of picked a betta spot!
Where was Gondor when the storm came?
Ded.
inb4 counting
MrBen LoLz
There are longer films. Experimental ones, mostly.
05,15The Two Towers and Return of the King were the only good movie games
Imagine that sight.
Give this Dwarf a stool!
Corpsing?
if i were fighting in a war i'd love a guy like gimli at my side
Heavy rain
Rain!
Have you noticed, on top of everything it's raining?
and suddenly rain
Samwise_Gamgee: what abotu Peter Jackson's King Kong? that was pretty good
Gimili is always awesome.
at least it isnt raining ....oh snap
damn rain!
The sight of thousands of enemies marching towards you as you sit there, backed into a corner.
Rain
PREPARE THE GIMLI PULTS
Troll weather
That would be terrifying.
damn rain
I LOVED THE HELL OUT OF THE TWO TOWERS!!!
where is Rain?
dont shoot or anything
Meanwhile: that a bad sign
04Corpsing is a term for when an actor accidentally breaks character when he means not to
atmosphere buiding
@Samwise_Gamgee = I think Spider-Man 2 would like to have a word with you
hey look, Rain is here. Hi Rain! You're on LoTR!
I suddenly have the urge to play Battle for Middleearth again...
otakon: TF2 last I looked.
ah
I thought it meant they laughed?
Gandalf_the_Brony: That's a little morose of a term.
Dumblewhore: that too
04You could say that too, yeah
it's an omen
I have the urge to play The Third Age again
otakon: And I'm sure random pinging is just as irritating nonetheless.
04It's mostly used for when they laugh
Gimli is like that wisecracking guy from Brooklyn in the old WWII movies. Except he lives.
lol
HUUUUUUUUUUU
Zephyr: sadnly, no
Meanwhile: oh really :P
*sadly
hmm

Combustiblelemons: Turned my ping sound off, deal with it.
Ryunosuke: yes they are
04But knowing the movie, I'm sure it was meant to happen
Meanwhile:
"do not give mercy for you will not be given it"
i bet that uruk would make an excellent death metal vocalist
thats what aragorn said
LOL
Fighters! START YOUR ENGINES!
05,15Kencolt I never realised it but you are right. The wisecracking New Yorker never survives
they need a gatling gun
Btw they are making a Lego Lord of The Rings =_=

otakon, how many people here are only 2 days away from retirement?

Theoden uses Human Arrow Barrage.
First row of enemy minions is down
The Uruk-Hai wouldve won this if they didnt rely on zerg rushing a fucking CASTLE
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: On the wall of Helm's Deep during the battle, a one-eyed warrior turns to the camera, revealing his scarred empty socket. The performer who played him showed up as an extra, wearing an eye patch; director Peter Jackson politely asked to see what was under the patch, and then inquired if the gentleman would be interested in appearing in the film sans eye patch. The

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In an earlier version of the script, Arwen was to have fought alongside Aragorn at Helm's Deep. Footage of Arwen fighting some Uruk-Hai was shot, but was not used in the final film.
Little_Mac_Green_Glo: love and tolerate doesnt mean being a dormat. :P
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The scene with the Uruk-hai before the Battle for Helms Deep starts, where they stomp their spears into the ground, was inspired by the same act the stuntmen would do between takes to pass time. After seeing it, Peter Jackson liked it, and put it in the movie.
OR...We can punch THEM!!!!
