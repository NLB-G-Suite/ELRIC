00,02Shizuka, i've been meening to play one of the myst's

00,02there is a demo
00,02downloading now
That does not look like Vector. :P
13it is very draining mentally
00,02dumps the eula to the terminal
00,02no less, just all to the terminal
13it's why i have civ 3-5 but never play them too

deus ex hrhr
00,02yeah, dx:hr has good music
This music type?
Hmmm...
13i usually avoid lyrics cause i run the playlist all the time
13lyrics interfere with code
Progressive Harmonics with light choir....
13progressive trance is my home genre, ambient comes next, especially in the vein of the Myst OSTs
i give up on talking until i finish this download. when i download things, it leaves none of my net for anything else.
13A State of Trance is where i picked up a handful of the tracks i used in the cathedral mixes
04Hello everyone
my music type is mostlike Metal but i still like to hear something else sometimes :3
00,02wait....
00,02is this downloading all of tf2
13probably
13the server has to understand everything
Got any "spooky" trance music?
04How is everyone doing?
13spooky no

How 8 bit trippy music this is...
04*nor

13ah ja and i have probably 100 tracker files
hello everypony

XD
00,02ACS13123, yeah

Noone has asked for ponies :P
13this is about the only one off that album i liked enough to throw in the potpourri list
00,02ACS13123, not public yet
13nope
04Lol thanks
Recommend you take a listen to them, they have an interestin mix you may enjoy
Hopefully
Nono, the music of course.
13ja but it dampens my interest in their soundtracks usually
13oh now i see the problem, i forgot to actually put the Myst OSTs in the list

I actually watched that not too long ago
13http://fav.me/d4l0l42
Anyone here got a PS3?
No, it's not
I'm not wasting1 and a half hour for watching soemthing that's has no effort in it

04I thought they added drop-in co-op now
My goodness, that Pyro's high on his own fumes xD
I meant on a scale of badness. If you were looking for the worst possible movie to watch with a bunch of friends to make fun of, Birdemic wins hands down.
I need to rest, for I give blood tomorrow.

-lol

Where have I heard this before?
13EDGE OST
EDGE?
EDGE!
I don't recognize that one...
Thank you WTF is.
/me thinks and thinks.
I'll see you guys... next time I see you, I guess :$
/me dances
FML
Iron_Edge...eek you spent 18$ on that thing..
Wow this song. :O
13silly winamp i told you stop after current
Ooo, Lilium
dat lilium
/me has a midi of this as his ringtone
13two versions of the song
/me sings along~~
this song...WHERE have I heard it before?
13plus like three others at the end
13Elfen Lied
oh
13basically
04Elfen Lied is definitely pushing it
kite
13the first six minutes are a naked girl tearing people apart with psychic powers
This makes me want to play Assassins Creed...
13and every episode after someone is similarly torn in half with massive fountains of blood
13the story is very very good, but you have to get past the gore first
13true, and we've shown worse movies
the gore is part of it and i like it awsoem show :3
04I KNOW
04Cromartie High
queen's blade
13elfen lied has an amazing payoff at the end
CROMARTIE HIGH!
04Zero gore and it's PG
manyuu hikenchou
04But it's like the funniest anime I've ever seen
13haibane renmei~
XD
oh neat
04...HEY! Some anime! There's been hardly any movement! *pencil falls on floor* O-Oh..it's moving
/me is 50% awake now
13it's a little like inception where you're not sure if the story got closed or not
13iirc the anime finished before the manga
gantz
^
13but at least it did end
Same happened with the StarOcean anime. That drove me nuts
13unlike other series that just.. won't... die...
04I can tell you why Cromartie High is the greatest anime ever: An entire episode is devoted to the students trying to remember a song from the radio
13this is Riverdance
13it's the only album of its kind i have, but that's okay
Hey everypony!! :)
13Ghosties: isn't there a scene where the whole school has to answer whether milk is the main ingredient in yogurt?

00,02turns out it needs to download all the tf2 for that

13plus maps are massive things
00,02yeah
all the things
00,02maps are ~60%

13maps pretty much start at 50MB and go up from there i think
00,02Shizuka, i'm seeing some smaller maps, but mostly yeah
the most advanced hat simulator ever created
13itemtest is the smallest
13or should be
13of the stock maps... i would guess..... koth_nucleus is smallest?

http://www.fimfiction.net/story/35421/
Here ya go, it's my first FiM fic

>mfw there was a lottery and I missed it.
00,02oh yeah, i missed the lottery too
00,02who won?
I woke all itchy and dry and dreamt of foreign coins for some reason.
00,02Rain, they just re-used last weeks
the same link and everything?
00,02Rain, no, the entries
oh..
00,02ACS13123,
00,02derp
/me isnt sure if she put hers in last week but hopes she did
00,02should be on the website but i didnt see it earlier today
not like I would have won anyway
the coin dream clearly come from my repressed regret of spending my gold-plated quarter.
/me writes a fanfic where Fluttershy becomes invisible and never finishes it.
i never get pony dreams
it was a good one this time, no nightmarish scenarios
I still remember that one O_o

o____o
That's... a lot
i've heard good things about limbo and amnesia
04When I got Terraria, I played it for a month straight
Amnesia is amazing
04Limbo is excellent too
04Incredibly atmospheric
and SPIDERS!
but replay value = 0
04Whereas Terraria has HIGH replay value
I don't know if I would play Limbo all day long, too.
04However, Limbo is fun to go back to after a while
Gas chamber o_o
you would finish limbo before you could play it all day long
^dat as well :D
O.o
Dang, i wish Mircosoft Flight was cheaper...
04Yeah, it was a great indie bundle this time. Too bad I already own Limbo, Amnesia and Bastion

00,02mips mehaves wierd
00,02behaves'

00,02i probably shouldnt be building rockets
fine for me
00,02ah well

there we go, only seconds behind now
still 3 seconds behind >.>
00,023 seconds is briliant
3 seconds behind is an acceptable delay.
00,02infact its probably some kind of record
00,02nominal delay is at least 20
more like 12-20 seconds
00,02so yeah
both
why is stream bcking up?
shuttle module
00,02RainBowJack, wish i knew

08,01well, afternoon
Saturn: Afternoon from here

04Saturn and Luna missed the kids
08,01i'm actually at a con
08,01KIDS?
Hi Saturn
Awww
04Yes, kids
04Dumb kids

08,01it's more likely than you think
kids that deserve a beating
^
00,02suddenly yellow

:D
kids that tried to steal my innocence
hey Saturn how did the presentation yesterdyy go?
00,02huh
00,02dis thing cant lift itself
00,02that could be a problem
sure it can
just add more bombs
08,01<3
Or a bigger engine
How does it feel to be named after my favorite planet, saturn?
00,02bigger engines
08,01turtlegod98: it feels fantastic <3
00,02by which i meen more engines
and also, firing the solid boosters would help
08,01alexxm: interesting
lolded
o_o
wat?
:D
that went well
00,02wow
At least the Kerbals survived?
this should be fun
weeeeeee
MAYBE
Hey guys
I would go to just about Every con in Florida....now..... nothing :'(
Wait....
00,02RainBowJack, allmost
00,02different in design and intent though
Aw crap
i assume that wasn't supposed to happen
At least it had parachutes
/me wonders how much of the thruster cone evaporates
^
Yeah. You staged too early there
Ooh, landing upright would be cool.
Sure did, thx for asking
All ended well.
00,02omegasparkle, a few
04...but how does it taste?
seems legit
OOO,i might buy Waves :3
play one with gunz
And the gerbils lived
the end
Or not
:p
:D
you might regret it
TF2
doesnt regret it
One does not simply order the streamer around
^
:D
I like TF2. My favorite server is a deathmatch server on a farmville map... Alot of spawnkillers but it is all fun.

might be more
Oh wow :D
:D
00,02ok
He has also made a trip to the further moon, and got back too
00,02dis stage has to get the upper stage (shuttle and tanks) into orbit
There is a further moon?
00,02the upper stage should be enough to shoot for and land on mun/minmus
00,02provided i land somewhere flat
00,02TheRandomkid321, minmus
00,02Dalekkahn, nah, just experimenting
This wont work!
00,02i want something that can land on minmus/mun then make it to the other one before returning home
00,02TheRandomkid321, thats the fun bit ^_^
sho' nuff Dy-no-mite
by bribing then with pony pics
00,02alexxm, i have no idea
00,02Mutterguy, its utter crap
hai everypony
00,02not too usefull and booring to pilot
and time travel
I think i am behind on the stream... Oh well...
00,02this seems safe

00,02wow
00,02dat exploded faster than expectedf
spoilers!!!
D:
We are still like 2 minutes behind
you haven't even launched yet
00,02o i
00,02the boosters are inside one another
00,02that could be problemati
00,02c
00,02ah well
00,02just have to deal with fewer boosters
it's inside itself?
moar rockets within rockets
it's the middle one
lolded
00,02Dalekkahn, ikr
that went well
Boom!!
moar boom!!
wait
wut?

i heard wordz and it drew my attention back to this tab
Dat everfree radio!
00,02k
00,02this craft wont work
/me bobs his head to the beat
00,02at least not properly
needs more struts
Needs more thrusters
00,02whats suposed to happen is the outer tanks on the shuttle part should be drained first
00,02fuel lines are doing nothing
/me mutes stream, its in conflict with my own music XD
00,02unless the directin has something to do with it
stage&
00,02Dalekkahn, i did that
Holla everypony! :)
and i cant hear steve's voice
00,02need to wait for the boosters to run out
00,02i'm not sure where the stream is
you just made a bunch of pipes
you were just adding some fuel lines
00,02ah
The stream is about 3 minutes behind real time
you just said fuel lines are draininh
draining*
00,02the way you lay fuel lines decideds which way fuel can go
00,02so i fixed the problem
00,02this can work
00,02note to self

04Before we get into any arguments, the side rooms are closed
04So he can only be here
Damnit
00,10hmmmmm
i didn't use any profanity
00,02as imposible as it is to land
04Read the rules if you have to, but just don't get too explicit with sexual content
just suggestive wording
00,02Dalekkahn, my birthdays are quiet
oh yea
00,10we seem to have a puppeteer
-_-'
i forgot that
00,02Sumica, you on stream?
00,10nope
hey guys

00,02i was orbiting at 2.2k
00,02i deserved that
Aw.
00,02Sumica, restarted stream, you should see the vab now
04omega, the side rooms are closed right now
00,02the first stage needs a little more power
00,02enough to get it into orbit
00,02i burn through a tank and a half in the upper stage doing that
/me stops being and AntiJoker
04And we don't advertise other channels either
..
brb
dindin
aha! sound!
00,02omegasparkle, and now the wating for season 3 begins
SOUND!
00,10odd shuttle
00,02lol nice, stream isnt too far behind
04Red?
00,02Sumica, the upper bit can allmost reach orbit on its own
04Haha, hello :P
How are you still awake O_O'
time sure goes fast, huh?
cuz i never sleep
04No idea
yup
dat time...
other half is next week... /nervous
Here we go!
ok

>D}
Damnit!
00,02ALLMOST enough for orbit
00,02Sumica, havent noticed the issues
00,02and trying to use all stock parts
00,02no fun in mods, they make it too easy
the stream literally just rewinded like 3 seconds
and the song referred derpy doo?!
or did i hear it wrong?!
Ikr
10Meep
no, you heard right :D
that's a long song...
12Sky :D
So...hows everypony doing>
I find the word Derpy awesome.
chaotic
My Keyboard layout eppearently just changed ...
And then, people were expecting 24/7 ponies on stream again.
04Ah, in that case:
spinning only annoys the astronauts
Smiiiiile
yup
or ^
i seem to be making you type alot
youd think it was a chatroom
:D
04Oh, I didn't type that. I simply copypasted
i see wat you did there
04It's on the website
I just released my first song
04Then you should, I dunno, READ THE RULES
weeeeeeeee
10Soi!
weeeeeeeeee
Also, never say you haven't read the rules.
its mostly just lyrics right now though
00,02i'm not using the shuttle bits cause its a shuttle
04>salt and vinegar
hiiiiiiiiiiiii :3
04You disgust me
00,02i'm using them cause large light tanks
10hi Chimew

Great, now I want a huge bag o' chips

/me purrs and returns snug
00,02oh cool
00,02it floats
00,10every thing flotes
yesh
It's just lyrics right now though.
04Hey Derpy, please stop advertising unless you can get permission
Success!
00,10there is no underwater to realy caculate
it didn't explode
00,10........why wheels if no wings?
oh ok
advertising is posting links.
and said that I made it
00,02i feel dis needs more rockets
04Advertising is also going "Hey! Check out my stuff!"
I did not say that
00,02wanted to try land on wheels on the mun
"Never argue with mods"
I wasn't advertising
00,02Sumica, the mod ones i think, stock ones explode like normal
neverrrr
00,10aye
04Stop
00,02Sumica, theres a problem with the nosecone, if you hit it just right it'll fling you into orbit or through the ground
00,10it's also realy bad with the SRB's
04You have to get permission first
00,02XD
00,02Sumica, wish you got a recording of that
00,02would be great tos ee
00,02to see'
00,10that second set is just extra weight with no extra thrust
It needs more rakkit!
00,10mind you that's 83m to the bottom of the C&C bit.
00,10it's probably another 10m tall frm there
epic flight contraption you got there
00,02those extra srb's have added the boost i needed
00,02Sumica, yeah

00,10so much overheat
*heart

:o
another flock of haters maybe?
oh and hello again everone
00,02hmmm
00,02not quite enough
dawww
08,01>says 'Saturn V'
08,01>pings Saturn
/me looms over Saturn
yeah i should have spaced it out
Lol
12Congrats! :3
Saturn, how much do you know about Archlinux?
10Thank ye
no
I SAID BOOURNS
live on stream
08,01Gunny: i've never used it
08,01so ask away
00,02it looks kinda prety
00,02when transfering orbit
The Plastic on one of the lights ast Bronzcon began to burn >&
/me sees Kerbantartica
00,02seeing the other planet aproach
/me waits for them to turn off the lights
00,02no stress on anything
00,02i could slingshot around mun and go for minmus
oh my gosh
http://twitpic.com/a2pj8r
that's just wrong
why is that light still on
a latter
wait, a ladder
oshit
a Stepladder_
ladder, but not a light switch
man, that is an AMAZING announcer
hope nothing goes wrong
?**
00,02theres actualy not much point to slingshotting around other planets
SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
GHOSTBUSTERS!
aww\
00,02the difference betwene a mun transfer and minmus transfer from kerbin is bugger all
why is that light still on ffs
00,02might as well just go direct
does this count?
TURN THE SODDING LIGHTS OFF! :D
wrong lights
WHY THE FUCK HAVENT THEY cut the power yet
soo dangress
please don't turn the camera off
is the floor alright?
it is right above the seating area of the main stage
wow
the cut it
well, at least the lights are out now
00,02spaceflight is beautiful
08,01so this just happened: http://imgur.com/Jjr8V
someones taking photos
wtf
LANDING ON THE MOON
.jpg
00,02o
00,02i'ma try actualy land this time
you need rockets for that
it looks like it is a normal diffuser that all the lights have. that one just had a problem
overheat
00,02none of this low orbit crap
parachutes won't work
00,02AskDerpyDoo, i have 3
I see
there's no air on the moon
there goes the bulb
Are they just letting it burn out? :D
is this the FREE version>?
Ohh... there's the bulb.
EBIL I SAY
besides
metal roof
yup
But where are the firefighters in all that? :P
did you land?
getting there
nice ladders
theres just a pool of burning molten plastic
00,02i'ma try de-orbit carefully
lost signal?
LOST SIGNAL
Depends on what's inside the bulding too. A building full of explosive material probably shouldn't be left to "burn out."
We get signal
its you
the light was above the stage :O
UNIT LOST
we got movie sign
lost signal
we got a sign of LOST... never watched that show
^
Power went out, cry
Twas a great pyre
http://vocaroo.com/i/s0m1YewucsMI my reaction to lost signal
lol datEQD post
00,02the rcs isnt realy neded on this craft
00,02its there to help with takeoff and landing should i need a sudden burst
OF THE MOON
00,02under power though it doesnt matter
The announcer was annoyed at how noone was turning off the lights.
00,02rockets have vectoring
i'll just wait for the signal to come back
00,02makes things nice and easy
I think I was an early contributer to the flood
how do you plan on getting OFF of the moon?
Oh godd guys guys listen

On the main stream at Everfree-- that joke passed by 100 times in a minute. As did all the others.
I used to be an adventurer like you...
did the interviewers get hijacked?
"The light fixture was burning calmly." lol
Light fixtures always burn calmly, because they're incapable of getting excited.
Well, at least the light fixture wasn't burning nervously. That would have been a disaster.
Combust, you say?
