Yes
I grew up with Megaman :s
DoctorTimeyWimey: not at all, LOL
me too
but whatever.
I grew up with Rockman though
dem derp eyes
i think rockman is more appropriate considering it was done with a musical theme and the music of mega man games is not only very important to the feel of the games, but epic as well
Placebo: REally? :O are you his bro?

It was a school band hah and the band I was in a band but I quit.
Phase4: I don't understand...
DoctorTimeyWimey: Hugs. Go with it.
/me is unconscious
This song is dank!
/me proceeds to hit MahBoi777 with a baseball bat to help put it out
/me hugs Phase4 " Hugs are good "
/me Loots MahBoi777's unconcsous body
" I miss being in band" << few way;s to interpret that
no loot there
Improper use of the word dank ftw
:)
hugs are good
i can only think of a very few ways Phase4
hugs are indeed good
Could be a music band, a band of brothers, a band of bees...
but dont you get any funny ideas if my hoof accidentally touches your flank, it wasnt intentional <.< >.>
wut.
god i hope they give trixie some screen time in this season
Think she and the flim flam bros are gonna be one time appearances.
Ingwaz: it MIGHT happen
or at least make her part of the season 3 openner
oooh!
I just had a idea
Ideaaa
i hope not placebo, i can see flim and flam, but trixie has more potential to return
Trixie, Gilda and the FF brothers meet up
i dont like this idea already
LOL
Give it a chance.
ofc you wouldn't
:'( poor trixie
I;m sad :c
;.;
Poor tr-dammit Phase4
:'c
lol, my stream is at least 3 s behind all of yours and i still ninja
#1 gilda's a hater, #2 flim and flam have epic music but theyre conmen and for that, TO THE MOON! #3 i'm hoping for some development from trixie, perhaps turn from her former ways
sudden Ingwaz
I wasn't lookin' at it.
I want BIG MAC development
I was watching this image, the music suits lol http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/245002

Redeeming herself
Say what..?

Phase4: If you like anime, it's worth a shot.
RawketLawnchair: waffles are like cocaine thats completely legal, everyone loves them
Geass is for people who need Geass
Sudden Big mac n braeburn rivalry?
Placebo: not much for anime, to me its just a different art style. do realy like some of what i've seen though
what is the original anime name?
Pokemon
lol
Phase4: Give it a shot. Funimation dubbed it, if you prefer English. It's not bad. The show itself is great
its originally just called code geass
dubs suck

You lot are scary yo for real.
SuperBrony64: I'll send you the money for it if you stream yourself making/eating it. Lol
THis almost works.
Phase4: true
Its not that we have teh most dumb, its that we have one of the larger populations
I can't even imagine what it would be like not being able to graze.
You guys can't graze right?
Like, on grass.
P0n-3: I eat things that eat grass.
Hawkpony: but theres still proportinaly more than the uk for example
10,02Placebo: LOL, deal :3
I ate grass once
It's like... you're hungry, find a nice patch. Most ponies don't 'cuz plain grass kind of sucks.
10,02We ALL eat grass silly
But if you find some nice rich stuff it's cool.
Being a wolf, not so much. I mostly eat Parasprites. We have many ways to serve them... and yes, we have Parasprite bacon.
10,02WE'RE PONIES
can humans still process grass? i think thats what our appendix's are suposed to do
/me Eats cows =s
oh my, it's so delicious looking
Placebo: heck, I'd love to see that, LOL
clover is tasty
All these bitches and all this cheese
Phase4: There's no nutitrion in it for us. We don't have the bacteria to break it down
damnit, now i'm hungry
Yeah, as usual, SB64 forgets I'm a wolf. SIgh.
Most ponies pay for food because, well, stuff that's made into more appealing stuff is nicer to eat.
I need to leve
Phase4: I'm fat and I'm proud
leavel
Placebo: ah, that clears that up
But we all eat grass sometimes.
MahBoi777: preach it brother
Roughage is good for you!
Jamba juice!
:D
we get less energy out of it than the digestion costs
Phase4: It's why most grazers (cows, bovines in general) have multiple chambered stomaches.
I'm gonna go get some ice cream
We're called gramnivores, dude. Or ungulates at least.
nerd = glasses, got it
Placebo: makes sense
Eeyup.

And they're like what's up, horseface. And I'm like yeah, my horn is the awesomest part of my face. I can pick stuff up without my mouth. Except food.

Congratulations. Every stereotype about girls eating being sexy just DIED FOR-EVVERRRRRR.

P0n-3: It's his only appearance in the show. We aren't supposed to care about him =s

Or at least Dr. Who.
Any Dr. Who.

Who's that? I only know dr whooves and dr doolittle
*Gets behind the shield with Hawk* I don't know enough about them to tell them apart, sometimes.

08,01do any of you use Tor?
not famillier with that
08,01it's an anonymising service
'night
08,01creates an encrypted anonymous circuit
08,01so anything you do over it can't be traced back to you
08,01buuuut
08,01it also has another useful purpose
08,01it provices a pseudo-top-level-domain, .onion
turns out my computer seized. first time i;ve ever had the problem and not a clue what caused it
08,01so you can host hidden services on it

gn
08,01your .onion address is a hash of your private key

cool, I guess
08,01including services and a nifty little web client

I thought pegasister was the female equivolent of brony o.o
i started watching in august after hearing about on the internet
I found a PMV for "Trouble Is A Friend" last year
05brony is gender neutral in a majoritys eyes
I considered myself brony but whatever
Ah ok then, so how did you all become bronies?
05saw a forum thread, got directed to the first ep
05the rest is history
08,01Thunderpony: i [censored] a [censored] until it was [censored] and the sun came up
PMV that came out after the second episode last year
08,01what a night.
January last year. My friend told me about it. I though he had gone insane. He mentions Lauren Faust and here i am
anyone goin to broNYcon?
curiosity, they were everywhere, could'nt ignore them
08,01but srsly, a friend of mine who wasn't a brony suggested we watch it ironically, but i was in germany at the time
Friend told me about it, made me watch videos. Told him it was stupid, i watched the first episode and he gave me a trollface and stated "Welcome to the herd"...i still have to get him back for that.
08,01i mean, uh, watching MLP
xD
05lets see
08,013 episodes in, i was hooked
Brooklyn rage?
05what to do...
05ah i know
08,01Wrek: inverse fleur 63?
Could be fun
08,01Wrek: draw a non-euclidian space!
Rule 63? What's Rule 63?
gender swap
O.o
gender bend
08,01Thunderpony: r63 is sexy sexy sb64
08,01i hope that clears thigns up
Thunderpony: google it. its a rule of the internet
Can you just tell me how to practice proportions wrek? Oh he's playing a game
streamception. do ho ho i'm so witty
this is a doom mod I believe
05nope not a mod
So that is doom guy?
Back in the days when the gun was centered
Dancing demon!
God this soundtrack is awesome
Those things remind me of watchers
So i never played any of the doom games, how is it?
If you consider yourself a video game fan
you should absolutely play it
The map is not linear? What is this sorcery!?
And yes, doom is awesome
I know he's killing demons but where the hell is he and why are there demons there?
he is on Mars
Whut?
They opened a portal, people got possesed
and there are monsters because it's doom
doom just has them
dont ask questions
He is killing that is what he is good at
thats basically what doom does
Is it hard? Because i like to play hard games
to start its pretty easy
05if you play on ultraviolence doign a nostrafe run...
05yes if gets unforgivingly hard at times
what he said
Sounds like a game i can enjoy
I'll try to pick up a doom game behind the new ninja gaiden thats coming out
have we streamed marble hornets
05a tip
05buy the pack fro msteam
05extract the WADS
05and use a 3rd party program to run them
Like DOSbox
That's a emulator right?
05doomsday or zdoom are alot smoother to use than clinky dosbox
I'll register zdoom and doomsday into my memory
And by that, i mean i'll take a cellphone picture so i don't forget
xD
Saved!
I had forgotten how awesome this soundtrack is
It makes you feel so alone
I like
I feel old whenever I remember that this game seemed so damn advanced
So does this have the infamous BFG that even non-doom players know about?
05ofc it has
A plethora of guns in your arsenal and walking over healthkits to get healed. My type of FPS
Sweet
Holy hell
05fucking ARCHVILES
heya all
Pyro demons?
This game have it all
Owned
Rocket launchers, those haven't been in decent shooters for a while.
nice trap
05fuckign archviles
05and even worse, teleportign archviles
I hear epic music
dat tune
Is the quit screen actually calling you out to continue?
05always does
05taunting and insulting
05different message each time
Lol, i like this game
those days when games were epic...
Nice
05oh yeah, welcoem to bronystate thunderpony, read the rules and enjoy your stay :D
Oh thank you very much!
I was just wondering how you get proportions so well, is that something you work at or is there a technique for it?
Good morning everypony
Morning Jim
05always both
05one may have talent, but talent is worthless without practice
So how did you get proportions right and things like that?
Just practice?
well i'm off to bed, night #BronyState
Later phase
g'night
good night Phase4
On it

I think so HeavyMetalDash

good morning Dken2021
Its dead Jim
lali-ho Jim
Not if we can do something about it :P
How are everyone?
Internet why are you derping （╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
DJ you should be tossing internet instead of tables.
I woke up at 2:30 pm today, but that's because I fell asleep at 7:30 am
good, one of my puppies doesn't seem to want to eat his food for some reason
not sure why
┻━┻ ︵╰(°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
you tried letting the other sniff his food?
O_o
yea, but she still doesn't want to eat it
Sometimes when one of my dogs does that the other tries to get his food, and then all out of the sudden the first dog chases him away and eats anyways XD
she used to get definsive about it, but now doesn't even care
oO
Maybe she's just not hungry or it's just that she's in a grumpy mood
been able to get her to eat by hand though
ooo ok
I guess, thanks for filling in i suppose
She'll eat when she gets hungry enough
I have a cat who always is nagging for food, but if we feed him he just smells him and leaves
So we feed him at set times of the day
well if she does eat when you feed her directly it has to do with discipline rather than schedule/health
so that's good~
slow chat this morning...
indeed
Yeah
So...How about them ponies?
ponies you say?
wait ponies? what madness is this :)
I don't know, I was talking to this guy once, and he was like "Dude, PONIES" and I was like "No wai!"
oh god nostalgia bomb...
It was hilarious, you should have been there
watching old Jeoparty show - category is Networking (names several programs, you name the network)
the answer: "Teen Titans," "SAmurai Jack," "Cow and Chicken."
Oh my, that's awesome
I agree
oh im back. something i missed?
Wasn't someone streaming nostalgia night on saturday night?
i believe that's Sumica, and he does it just whenever
i'm not sure all i have up is the chat window
no stream right now - Wrek left
who here is going to be here for the friday episdoe?
me!
whoops episode
I will probably be here the entire week
^
this is my first time being here since last night so i want to give it a try
it's friday at 7 p.m right?
7 est yes
good :D my first live streamed chat MLP video!
also welcome to bronystate, we get silly sometimes
Sometimes... I dream about cheese.
Cheeeeese.
incrediously silly
but it's all in good fun
i know you guys get silly we are bronies!
Everypony becomes a silly filly once in a while
08,01so i just watched the new episode
I quite enjoy the silly filly aspect
08,01and honestly, it looks like Anusbis mated with one of H.R. Geiger's aliens
a filly is a kid pony right?
08,01*Anubis
Lol rainbow dash=epic tact
I must say, Battle Clouds, do want
bronyfan - that's a foal
MirrorImage: then whats a filly?
the episode this friday really reflects on what first time bronies do to thier friends
not this Brony
I was expecting a great episode, but it's still good nonetheless
they hide their addiction
08,01next week is a fluttersode, yes?
correction, i guess filly would be a kid; though specifically a girl
bronyfan: a Filly is a girl Pony
I was all like "Dude...PONIES" when I first discovered my obsession
I think it's the valentine's episode next
Randomnerd: oh ok. aren't almost ponies girls anyway?
HeavyMetalDash: That's exactly how I react when I meet other bronies in real life
lol
i feel in love witht his because of the interwebs
08,01bronyfan: well, horses are matriarchal by tradition
I've only met one IRL and I was the one who converted him
bronyfan: well, in Ponyville, yes, lol. Other towns have a bit more even a spread, if you've noticed
/me 08,01wonders what the ambient temperature of a pony is
08,01i would like to cuddle a fluttershy
I think there are more stallions in appaloosa, not sure though
08,01for science
lol
You nice person
I think horses are warmer than humans?
Randomnerd: like equstria there were male stallions who were very formal
08,01Randomnerd: i've heard from... a source... that this is the case
Between 99.8 and 101.3
F
one of my little cousins has a dvd of the show, she knows few of the characters
not C
08,01pah, use a sensible mesure like Kelvin
i have yet to have a cousion thats a little girl like this show
08,01Randomnerd: for sanity's sake, shall we assume i do?
I know right, Kelvin all the way
yes i have one of my friends who like this show and i told her
she doesn't know who luna is apparently
she was like what duuu?
08,01bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh
I've been going out with a girl recently, she thinks it's adorable.
but I suspected it since she only has the dvd
But she watches lots of cartoons.
08,01that's my bruh face
08,01pah, girls
08,01what do they know about ponies...
ikr?
lol
/me facehooves
08,01in other news, i think my brother's dog is attempting to assert his dominance over my father's leg
Bow chicka wow wow
whee!
I've probably got to clean some more, had pizza/movenight yesterday
movie*
Jim: Nice!
everypony is a brony here right? or a pegasister?
bronyfan: There are pegasisters who regularly comes in here, not sure if there are any here now
Jim: oh well
we sorta adopted brony as a unisex term
*Epic Sarcasm* Brony?...I'm afraid I am unfamiliar with the term...
I also like to call everypony just Brony, regardless of gender
but don't mind the term pegasister
08,01i hate
08,01ahem
08,01i *hate* the term pegasister
I think it's fine -I'm strange about language.
08,01there's no reason why females can't be called bronies too
Bronies is like adressing a mixed sex group as "You guys"
08,01i think rainbow dash would rather be a brony than a pegasister
08,01because brony sounds cooler
You think it's just one of those "Yes, I'm a girl on the internet, pay attention to me" thingies?
We do it, but it's technically dumb.
08,01Jim: no
08,01i just think that
08,01 people are a bit too stuck in gender binaries and political correctness sometimes
Brony is an all encompassing title that transcends gender,age,race it is the one title...To Rule them all!!!...or something like that whatever
The one fanbase. To rule, them ALL.
bronies have the *bro*part inthem. thus makes them a certain gender
as if
Well, it's stuck now regardless.
bro ponies?
like my name suggests
08,01i call girls "dude" all the time
^this
^
And they've never complained?
:)
nope! chuck teta
You know more easy-going women than I do, lol
08,01conversely, i also call my guy friends "lovelies"
:P *chuck testa
LOL what the?
The only one I've ever heard complaining about being called "dudes" are just those very stuck up ones
You know more easy-going MEN than I do, as well. lol
I usually call everyone my dear or dearie at some point IRL
08,01Randomnerd: no, they're just manlier
I don't call anyone by affectionate terms, come to think of it.
is there a video up?
not atm
because all i have is the chat window
I used to call my girlfriend by her first name, rather than anything affectionate.
I was pretty void of emotions untill recently
don't we call everypony by their first name?
08,01i call my brother f**ktard, but that's mainly because he is, on the whole, a f**ktard.
classy
bronyfan: I mean I never called her "honey" or anything like that.
oh kays
lol
thinking.jpg
08,01Randomnerd: i used to call my ex "wench"
+s
That's so piraty
trolol
Anyway, I think the term pegasister is fine (Dark Crystal reference ftw) but frankly, the name for the fanbase is Brony.
brony=male,pegasister=female
correct me if i'm wrong
you're right
:D
08,01bronyfan: you're wrong
I have never used the term "Brony" out loud, anyway. I say "Fan of MLP"
:(
only if you want to be really specific
I prefer the generalization
how was it the first time you told one of your friends that you were a brony?
they don't know yet
08,01i dunno, to me, making that distinction is like saying that Rainbow Dash must be a lesbian because she's a tomboy and has a rainbow mane
girl-:D :D :D whos the best pony? boy-(none yet)
my cousins on the other hand think I am weird, but they always thought of me like that
08,01also, Pinkie Pie is obviously best pony
They all know and I never asked nor cared what they thought about it or me...they still talk too me so I guess they're accepting of it
oh yea RD is a tomboy
That's not what was intended, any more than "Brony" is supposed to insist that "Male" is the default for Pony Fandom
when did bronies come to life?
08,01bronyfan: we were made out of pink, squishy clay
Anyway, the divirgent personalities of the Mane 6 demonstrate there's no WRONG way to be a girl.
:O yuk!
in the firey depths of 4chan my friend bronyfan
08,01our hollow husks were fired and filled with love
08,01then painted with a glaze of tolerence
when did people even become bronies?
Rainbow Dash isn't a lesbian because she likes athletics any more than Pinkie Pie is housewife because she bakes.
I became a brony once a friend of mine showed me the show
Simple as that
Same here, Jim.
08,01Randomnerd: yes, but you can't deny that she *is* a gypsy
and do your friends accept the fact that you are a brony?
I became a brony on my own through curiousity and an open mind
it was popping all over the internet and it got me curious
08,01s/op/oo/
i liked MLP because the interwebs liked it. so i had to see whats up
Dken2021: i know right? curiosity
lol my spelling sucks thats what I get for being up all night :P
08,01i became a brony because i'm stubbornly masochistic when bored
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P3HHpf-fZY is what got me interested.
08,01and then was proven wrong in my assumptions
watching MLP much? Dken2021 ?
yup
What is this, Firefly and MLP, this is relevant to my interests
lol
Krakass: Holy jesus sooo epic!!!!
:-)
ohgod
how did they do the vocies?

oh man where is the real video!

well not that I don't wub and enjoy talking too everpony online right now. I'm thinking that I now have to go and do some pony inspired artistic endeavors for a few hours.

Me, I don't give a toss, but I'm stuck going to a party anyway.

I like fotball not a big fan of handegg though
handegg? Is that what they're calling it now?
Oh, you silly europapeons
Well, half the time, it's in their hands
I'm not a sportsfan, what is this.
handegg is all the rage where I live
Handegg? Like what Silly Putty comes in?
hello everypony =)
Jam that over a picture of a ponie and pull it off
ohai StickySyrup
lali-ho StickySyrup
now you got two ponies
"Football" is Soccer. I prefer to refer to our peculiar sport as "Gridiron" -It's a nickname for the field, anyway.
Im so happy ... work got cancled because of snow
Germans like it, to my understanding.
What happened to 'pigskin'? That term disapeared when they started making footballs from leather...
And now they're synthetic
just like the fields
well some fields
Some fields still have real turf.
/me decides to listen to some Rick Astley

Cricket is a more violent baseball
Untrue.

Rugby is a ruffian's sport played by gentlemen.

umm... fail emote? :D
we're the nicest of all the internet
I got it, tears of joy
Dken2021: so i've heard
I'm imagioning battles between France and Britain were fought like gentlemen
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuHmEo0Bx7Q - My thoughts exactly, This is a day for Football! :[
>:D
what is this talk about pony rules?
StinkomanFan: Sort of. The age of Linear warfare was fought that way because weapons were not accurate enough for target shooting.
i don't understand
Animal Planet has a little special called "The Puppy Bowl"
The english longbow was more than accurate enough
-the soldiers stood in lines and blocks because there was safety in numbers, and the enemy shot at them because they could bring massed fire to bear
They round up a bunch of puppies, put them in a football themed room and let them run around for an hour
Yeomen never sniped French Knights, though. They filled the air with arrows
Again, it was massed fire that made the difference in a battle.
Except for the Half Time show, where they let kittens run around for ten minutes

Actually, I disabled all vital testing objects when I got back into my body.
Including Portal Guns.
veryfunny, master
Don't be contrite, don't be a parasprite?
Chell is the only one who still has a working portal gun.
I dunno

I'm going to a Super Bowl Party in about 2 hours
crystal skull reference
they'll have TONS of food there

I won't take off until 6 EST
i didnt even know the super bowl was today
i stopped rhyming for the moment, now it will bother you, wont it?
i think...I might be a nerd

you ARE!
The Puppy bowl is more important
YAY
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

randY?
*stabs you, too*
00,10I have a supperbowl party that I get to work tonight
family guy refference
08,01i've never really got what the superbowl is
08,01and why it's such a big deal
brb - apparently i got thousands of birds flying over my house right now
00,10last game of the seasion
and last game fo the season
its a big deal because its the championship game of football, and football is a big deal
Favorite superbowl commercial?
Pointy objects are ineffective; what was your mission directive?
Ive never watched a superbowl
now that leaves us with WHY football is a big deal
and to that I can't answer
Moop: the streaking sheep
Bud light
i dodge the stab you throw at me, you will have to try harder to suceed
00,10I watch it for the advertisments
otakon: YES! :D i love that one
...
me too
00,10and halftime
*ignores*
08,01NullRadix: football? for some reaosn i thought it was baseball related
argh
00,10baseball is spring
08,01which one's the baseball one?
go ahead and ignore, you are doing my job for me
World Series
HOW long has Soccer been called football?
00,10world serise
has any Bronystate regular been featured on fimfiction?
08,01oh, and by football you mean that rugby for wusses thing you yanks play?
yh
:/
08,01heh, armour...
He's pregnant.
he's a druggy!
00,10right "armor"
yh
that doesn't really work that well
08,01colourful armour.
bc there are still TONS of injuries
back
Rainbow in a wheelchair? This is too much; I would never be able to think of such
08,01yeah, we don't tend to wear that here
I wonder how our Football players would fair in Rugby?
08,01wait, hang on, which one's the one where they only play for like 10 minutes?
i feel like this is an older episode
no
it's an hour
dat NEC
It is Moop
08,01well, it's an "hour", but it's really just 10 minutes
15 minute sessions
Rugby is more intuitive than Gridiron Football.
00,10dont know of any sport with a 10min clock
08,01i can't remember if that's "football" or baseball
it's neither
00,10Baseball plays till it's over
08,01to be honest i wouldn't be able to tell the two apart anyway
But they're pretty tough without their padding.
Baseball is by plays
Football is time and plays IIRC
00,10football is 15 min quarters
A football play lasts about 10 seconds followed by a break.
08,01what if you play a quarter too long?
good morning everypony
08,01will you ever get that quarter back?
I'd start listening again if they did.
good evening ;3
Perhaps i should dial it down; i don't want to drive you out of town
where's football for dummies?
hiya MoscowBrony
08,01i know just enough about it to make terrible puns
It stops if you go out of bounds.
I think I remember hearing there are SPECIAL RULES to allow the clock to stop MORE often in the 4th quarter
08,01is that like the off-side rule?
00,10damn almost a mill
damn
08,01Randomnerd: i had a halfback once. turned into a fullback and a lot of drinking.
what are the testing?
:3 Good morinng Everypony.
they*
00,10off sides is crossing the line of scrimage before the play starts
i will not drive me out of town, so please refrain from dialing it down
Hi Dismo
/me 08,01bows

Poppy seeds and failing drug tests.
inb4 brokeback joke
you* not I
lol
08,01IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE BROKEBACK MEANS GAY
so if I eat enough poppy seeds....
08,01Cypresswolf: surprisingly little poppy seeds are required to fail a drug test
00,10yes Cypresswolf
08,01and even less cocaine
^_^
cosmiclatte is all mad, perhaps my rhyming is that bad?
everypony knows how to turn off status-messages like "pony_1234 has quit" in ajax webgate?

"Yeah, we're going to be painting our friend in paint."

and to think, that simple request forces them to revisit this myth later
at Adam's expense

Yup
Rectal thermometer.
Fun.
Yup.
now he gets a portal can
based on how much Adam was laughing, i'd say so
Goooooldfinger!
It's been so long since I've seen these episodes it's like watching them anew.
me too
and I'd be ded by now
I have no stamina
stamina is something you have to build

hmm.. it might be a good idea to ponify smb to see first episodes one more time
and now.... the fun part
but I HATE running
cosmiclatte, dont you hate, youre the one leaving us at a later date
you have access to a gym? with ellipticles or similar "run in place" things?

Globetrotter: it does

Oh, my.

Oh my.

08,01hey, everypony! <3
Radu: Indeed
Radu - that's because we actually have random things to talk about
for example: ponies
Dat MirrorImage
all the amazing forklifting action
08,01here's my crappy attempt at my OC in pony creator: http://i.imgur.com/wiCii.png
Even greek gods browsers crash...
cool
Hallo bronystate
its pretty cool
Lol
08,01and it doesn't afraid of anything
I need to make an OC now
isn't you mean?
no planet on it's flank?
woof
Athena: Good luck with that.
This is amazing footage you have here. It is music to mine ears.
woof woof
Thanks
wooooof
everypony should make an OC!
08,01alternative smarmy version: http://i.imgur.com/7zVFf.png
I already HAVE an OC.
Lol
Dat censored cutie mark
Hey RAWRity
Hey, want to thank the bronystate crew for streaming us from the Dutch meet :p
it was so awesome!
08,01it was!
/me has to work on OC pony today
o.o
08,01TOY_PON32: give it lasers
Give it a pet!
I love critikal.
Soo, ratings on last episode? It was a personal favourite for me :)
DAT ASS
Eventually
9.5/10.
08,01Radu: i'd only give it 6.5/10, i'm afraid
im watching a vid on the grren beret spec forces
wat ^
I loved it
yay netflix
What did you dislike about the ep?o:
10/9.5
Radu: Rainbow Dash is best Egghead
I liked the BARKING PONY.
xD
08,01it felt like it was forcing a message, and it didn't really have much individual charm to it
I see.
^
Goodbye, fellas.
Bye R2-D2
EQD said it was gonna be a fluttershy episode
Last episode was so good
Moar Fluttershy
08,01MirrorImage: one of my favourites is Over a Barrel, actually
Its probaly my new favorite
Latest ep was maybe 6/10 for me. While I don't think it was really forcing its message, it's something I've seen too many times personally. Plus, the rest of the humor for the episode was just kinda average. Though I do give it points for giving us breaks from the traditional setting and characters with the Daring-Do stuff.
http://i39.tinypic.com/28he9n7.png That's my OC.
her name is Pinkie Pie
08,01MirrorImage: yes.
08,01>.>
08,01i thought Over a Barrel was funny, well thought out, and kinda epic
i called her Lightning Flash at first but then I changed it too Pinkie Pie, because that name hadn't been used before.
08,01loved the Bugsy Malone-ish pie fight
i liked dragonshy
Nopony has PS3, :c That makes me a sad Dismo
i have a ps3
I've been asking if anyone has ps3 for the past week!
i think ps3 is poop

I think we are all guys.
JarlCelestia is a dude like RAWRity said and otakon said
Well, it still doesn't explain why he put bacon in the soap.
it's a common thing around here not to know who's wat at times...
to smell bacon fresh?
We are all guys right?
yh
um no
I hope so...
yep
not all of us are guys here
Let me check.
Globetrotter: not all. there's the occasional female here.

Then what is chimmy cherry?

This is the Little Girl's 'father'.
PinkiePie101: it's when you fill a chimney with Cherries
Krakass: Sheperd
Epic fail. I said 'you told me.' So he says 'What is my name?'
oh cool
lol
I don't really have an opinion on the layout, didn't get any major changes from the feedback I was given
Fuck you all and stop insulting my kid!
Pinkie Pie can be really selfish
no one is insulting them
chimney with cherries... cool
This is still going on?
pony_8262: trolling?
Weird...
rarity catch me!!
how are we insulting you?
so who is getting Mass Effect 3
also, no one is insulting her right now. ._.
no idea
Moop, no doubt.
pony_8262: Good parenting there, letting your little girl into a pg-13 site.
08,01to be honest, i think it looks a bit... i dunno, 90s
Cleverbot fail.
05hey otakon

08,01but i think the basic layout of the site is fine
Wrek: yes?
I am a good parent!

Wrek: I don't have Minecraft

pony_8262: love
What am I missing?
tolerance

*give pony_8262 the boot*
Love and tolerance.

05then get it otakon of the filly will cry again
08,01and, of course, we have wrek et. al. here
Wrek: no money
We do, but if we want any artistic changes we have to instruct him well
you got 3 minutes Tovler then the real fun begins
and give him the time to do it
someone please get me popcorn
Alright, everybody just calm down and let's figure out what happened here.
Shit, this guy's thick.
did we kick pony_8262?
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-depression-dash.png
someone let their daughter into a PG-13
site
ikr
I don't see any kick messages
me either.
CB:WRONG!!! What's my name?
dat rainbow dash
the hell did i just see?
08,01okay, well, i say we maybe stick with this for now, as it works, but for BN we maybe take a different strategy to design (either wrekify, or i can make some calls)
scared.jpg
bronyfan: no, they didn't, it's just a joke.
eeyup
08,01i'll talk more about BN in a bit
04That's fine
okay, brb need COFFEE
what is this i dont even
RAWRity: about to say...
04In fact, I surmise that we'll make a different layout entirely for BN
also, http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-so-thats-what-she-does.png
i'm a filly and what is this?

Cleverbot: No, my name is CleverBot.

One AI, three names.

Seriously, little ponies though?
*Gets 1000 more friendship canons*

*POW POW POW POW*
Just show me a god damn episode of this show.
pony_8262: it's entertaining
i know its weird but trust me ull like it
GO F***K YOURSELF
WTF
What do you watch then pony_8262
once rainbow dash hits mach one... we are going to see some SERIOUS friendship
Did we make a decision on having a bar to show whether there was a stream up or not?
Someone get a youtube link of an episode
we just gotta wait
mario_pony: calm yourself
hold on
need a youtube
pony_8262: its called youtube
Show him Party of One. It plays up to the "lolponies" thought process then destroys it.
mario_pony: done :)
So, taking bets now, will this Year's Half-time Show be worse, or better than last year?
jusy type in MLP PinkiePie101
Show me episode 1...
hello everypony :)
08,01oh, aye, i think we were gonna put that in
Hi dashiee
Hello.
hello dashiee
13i think after the backlog plugin i'll look into something for an irc bot to poke to update
!
TS face looks cute :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUwsllMMiP4
:)
I didn't care much for the first 2 episodes
i just convinced that my name is twilight sparkle :D
I kinda liked them
^this
http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/005/787/i%20wub%20woo%20every%20day.jpg
Not as good as the other ones though.
well there just introductions
;)
true.
setting everything up
08,01oh, that reminds me, are we going to start using redmine for this now?
Otakon.
i think this weeks episode was on bronies not telling their friends
Why the story book starting?
yes Dismo?
08,01i think most of this is on the forum anyway, so maybe it'd just be more hassly
trying to hide their addiction
08,01*hassle
You're my brother. c:
idk buecause it is a book lol
Ooh, it's daytime
:\
:/
she is reading a book
:|
because it's telling the begining
"Once upon a time, in the magical land of germany..."
:B
I still say Party of One is the best first-impressions episode.
brb mc
;?
Who's that purple pony???
bronyfan: like me?
:)
"There were 2 regal sisters who harmed all the land..."
08,01also, next point, is rollout timeframe dependant on rollout timeframe of BN?
Stream bar gunna be in the theatre page?
08,01are we releasing them together?
The purple pony is twilight sparkle
i think you should show him dragonshy
Moop: what do you mean?
bronyfan: I'm confused, are you a Brony yourself, or just a FAN of Bronies?
08,01aye
both
http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF252-Carolyn.jpg
Theme song sounds good...
mario_pony: I already put it up
I'd say give them BS before we launch BN
i'm a brony and a fan of bronies
Latte-chan is leaving now <3
it wants to go out with me 6_9
Baiiguise :)
I think he's becoming a brony :-o
if that makes sense
Most people became bronies through fanart and AMVs anyway.
Wait...her name is Twilight?
bye
well the fandom is a interesting bunch
Considering we haven't started much work on BN, release BS 2.0 first.
Yes
*skips off for her date*
04^
I know what you're thinking.
08,01yeah; BN is going to be a more protracted project
pony_8262: lots of teh characters have names like that
i became a brony because of the internet! XD
05twilight sparkle is best pony
I can swear I've heard that from the 80's or something..
^^
and Sparkle , hows that for a vampire joke
I though this was ver interesting http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=UE7I_IDX98g
why do the vampires in twilight sparkle
R U high? RD is!
pony_8262: there was a original Twilight Sparkle
08,01at the Team Meeting, noises were made about releasing together
i dont rember if its real or dubbed but i rember a clop with discord holding twilight and saying "they will tremble at the power in my pinkie" :D
There was?
how should i respond
:\ I remeber watching MLP as a kid.
eeyup
08,01okay, let's set a timeframe for testing and realease, then
back in the 80's
http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF118-Missing_Grandfather.jpg
from the original intro
I don't think many team-members know about BN...
they only know I purchased the domain name in Dec
and the dragons called Spike?
which was shown here for the trolling amusement
08,01yeah... i'm going to come to that in a sec
eeyup
do you pay or do i
Heard that one too.
yup
04Unless you count my lofty speech in G a while back
most of the characters are redone from G1
so we are all bronies here correct? some pegasisters here too?
Is this show based off the 80's?
http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF090-Mrs._Hammer.jpg
05to an extent
but given new designs and personalities
what 6_9
Oh.
Yeah.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-the-big-lepony.jpg
Lol the part where his face is slammed on floor. xD
RAWRity: that is delightfully twisted
references 5 years olds won't get
the respond
just said yes
yep
and a fair bit of slapstick humour too
no no no. eeyup! alabama speak!
and TONS of fourth wall breaking
08,01i think we could have BS2.0 ready by next week; dari and shizu, do you think this is realistic?
OH
08,01(not iuncluding testing)
fourth wall?
ooh
Pinkie pie usually breaks the fourth wall.
13backlog could be done by then
mine little pony
thats what it said when i asked
hehehe
whats the 4th wall?
Ask it if it likes italian
i used to wonder what mining could be
bronyfan: it refers to when a character in the show more or less notices the audience
Princess Celestia...
:\
Soudns reasonable.
yh, no Queen
Also, it wants to know what i look like
http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF106-Billy_the_Bunny.jpg
05Q is best discord
Get used to it, it's a name.
Wait.
Q is in this?!
dari's awake
yeah!
05eeyup
:>
RAWRity: once again, good stuff
Showmeshowmeshowme
Second Season
Episode?
http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF228-The_Masculator.jpg
1 and 2
i asked it said "yes i do its one of my favorites"
pony_8262: he does the voice of the main villain in the Season 2 opening eps
season 2 episode 1
said i look like a duck
http://img.memecenter.com/uploaded/1Scumbag-Derpy_8a23a0d2ad653d4a0429e95185ecacc8.jpg
season 2 episode 1 and 2.
:D
08,01okay then; in that case, i'll stick with what i've got up on the forums in terms of feature ownership, i suggest you two write up features you want to implement on the forum too, just so we all know what we're all up to
yh
there are LOTS of nods to other shows and stuff
yeah.
08,01so far as testing goes, there's not a hell of a lot to test
08,01and we're testing as we go
that white little pony is dictionary. :3
oh yh
yes
well, one of the dictionaries
sweetie belle's the dictionary
but
and the orange one is a dodo. :3
and the third is a chicken
08,01i'll give the site a quick run down for security holes next week
applebloom is the other dictionary
oh god, it's awful, but I can't stop laughing: http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF187-Way_Too_Much.jpg
and scootaloo is a chicken
08,01then, barring catastrophe, we should be all set
RAWRity: agreed
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ff-R-kSwY_I/TxWlVHW2ilI/AAAAAAAABJM/n8JEMo6LsQM/s1600/karma+clown.jpg
Elizabeak is an orange pony
08,01right, moving on to BN
ok
hey
08,01unless anyone has anything else to add about bs2,0?/
but why is there a big orange pony in that class???
08,01pertaining to what i've covered, at least
11,01Hi.
big orange pony?
hmmm
04I don't
Snails
stream ain't workin :'(
OH YEAH!
hi Nittany
Snails.
is there something playing? cause i cant see adamn thing!
08,01dari, shizu?
No
no one is streaming
Nope.
nope
13nope
08,01excellent
Alright.
11,01Try this again.
11,01Hi.
hello!!
Hi.
must go!
The ONLY time there is going to be a stream is if there is a little live Icon on the player.
Hello Nittany_Discord
/me hugs Nittany_Discord
Hallo~
ohai Nittany_Discord
THEN and ONLY then is there a stream.
I am the first chicken it's talked to.
oh hai Nittany_Discord
has anyone seen shed.mov?
we don't talk about it.
damn gotta go to work bye everypony
bye
you mean scootaloo its talked to
bye!!
08,01so, first point is... i'm slightly miffed that the first i heard of BN was at the team meeting. if this is something that's been in the works since december, it might have been better to let us know about it when we joined to work on BS2.0 (i don't know if shizu knew about it or not)
byr Pon_Jovi232 stay brony!
bye Pon!
08,01i think there are some things we could have done differently, and some other considerations we'd have taken with bs2.0 if we knew about BN
13like luna said all we know is the domain has been bought, but otherwise i didn't have any idea about it
BORRRRRRRINGGG!!!!!!!!
aw. pony_8262 left. …who was that guy?
no idea
08,01okay
but they seemed to be digging the show
(guy from before, flash crashed)
lol
the father of a 5 year old
Omg this show is awesome.
ah
08,01what i'm getting at is that i, for one, feel pretty left out of the loop with regards to bronystate affairs sometimes
hey
new chat with cb
Well we talked about domain names and the next big step for BN.. but untill early January there were no concrete plans.
Ponies + Perry Bible Fellowship = http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF222-Gamblin_Man.jpg
you can change you nick to something else
he's back
said all your base
with /nick yournick here
Cool.
ima try that
reply was ocho and endor base
are there any pegasisters here?
08,01aye, but i think that's soemthing that techies should have been involved in the discussion of
/me /nick yournickhere <it'll look like that
04And again, mods caught glimpses of it when I spoke that speech
that's awesome
so is there going to be a stream anytime soon?\
no idea
cool.
I agree, that's a lesson learned for future plans
wait
said all your base are belong to us
bronyfan: hmmm, there are a few, but most are out atm
ad
didnt work lolz
08,01aye
We will include you.. but some of the information we share with you is not meant for mods
can we stream iz i saw my little boy watched that
but do they come here?
08,01aye, i understand
Especially if we're in the concept /idea phase.
yeah
they do
but it's really come and go
why is nobody streaming?
no streamer atm
ima try again
Wait...
I think so
yea
everypony run!
I am here. :3
:3
she will try to murder you!
i changed my name to sweetie derelle
:3
from Portal?
08,01basically, if you shoot ideas, we can tell you what can and can't work from the tech perspective, and other considerations such as integration
08,01but anyhoos, enough bitching about that
I'm pinkiepie101, I changed my name :3
I don't believe there was any bitching but I do appreciate the feedback.
still...........nothin6_9
08,01aye; also helps from a timescale perspective.... but moving on
http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF024-Puppy_Wish.gif
awkward silences happen sometimes
pinkie that is going to be confusing
04Indeed, the more communication the better. But yes, let's move on
deal with it.jpg
08,01right, so, 000web...
then ill change my name back
there
i am now typing "bacon" again and agian
08,01if we're to become the next big brony site, we simply need a better solution for our infrastructure
if theres nothin to see here,i'm goin to lord of the rings online
BROHOOF!!!!
k bye! sonicrainboomer259
have fun
hell
k good luck with that
I'm watching YT atm
*sees the user "spy"*
Pony.
ARE YOU A SPY?!
um...lol
Spy be sappin' mah spy
I have no idea!
08,01000 are pretty good, but if we want to store content, and if we expect a higher rate of traffic, we're going to find ourselves very limited very quickly
what 6_9
:|
:|
I am Heavy Weapons Guy.
Pootis
:S
Spy!
04What do you propose?
This is scout, rainbows make me cry!
Scout!
08,01what i suggest is we either use paid hosting, or rent our own server/vps
:[
that scout was me c:
bout to sign in
:'(
Heavy!
HUDDAHUDDAHAUDH
Medic!
and then TF2
woah
6_9
04Hmm
Scout is back
wait what
08,01the latter would be preferrable, and while it sounds prohibitively expensive, it can actually work out quite cheap
That's something we were gunna discuss when we switched over to BN I think, because then we can actually start taking in money.
:$
exactly
[Insert TF2 theme here]
04Yep
04Then we can possibly market
ARE YOU A SPY?
08,01well, as i said in the group meeting, we can start making money now through merch sales and commissions
I'm black
08,01but!
6_9
08,01kinda on the side
Spy is Spy!
08,01i spoke a bit about amazon EC2 the other day
Friendship is Magic!
08,01do you guys know what it is?
I am SPY
I'm black
04I do not
No wait.
Friendship is Pootis.
and now this place devolves into TF2 again
argh
He is Spy!
<3 all the things
I am not disguised as Heavy in any way!
So, how about them hats lads?
Nope
Guys, isn't this a brony chat?
Yes...HATS good!
08,01okay, so it's basically a cloudy woudy thing run by amazon that lets you run an instance of a virtual machine on their cloud
:D @ all the non bronys
So why are we being TF2 characters...
08,01or lots of instances, if you wish
Action hat simulator go!
sorta.
04cloudy...woudy
08,01it's very scalable and pretty cool
No.
/me tilts head
Just no.
that deosn;t mean we have to talk about ponies all the time
Speaking of which.. my dad is gonna provide us with a server.
oh so this cleverbot hates mlp fim huh
True...
You know about 'the cloud' Ghosties?
Puppy Bowl is on everypony
08,01oh!
04But would we have to provide funds to Amazon?
08,01that solves a lot of problems!
/me what
/me puts TopHat on his head.
04And I've heard of "cloud" but nothing much
ge the cb to sing the MLP intro
Spy: Medic!
Me too
Typed in My little pony
04But yeah, Luna's dad is providing us a server
and I don't mind chipping in some funds too...
o.o
wow i guess i cant draw the line :/ i cnat sotp watching anything from mlp from legit story to fan-fics to even *gasp* shippings :/
said to me
08,01okay, cloud basically means abstracted computing services
Oh wow.

Watch the Puppy Bowl! >.>
08,01the virtual machines are abstracted away onto a cluster of computers
do you know you're all my very best friend
No, watch the pony bowl.
And bring a spoon.
a you are mine
:|
i have very few friends
/me would watch the shit out of the pony bowl
same here
08,01so they can basically deliver things like virtualisation, storage, and content distribution as a service
04So you're saying you could use the software without actually being on the hardware or server it's installed on?
08,01platform as a service, i think it's called
13long story short, spikes in traffic are handled smoothly
04Interesting
13no matter how big the spike
Pony Bowl hasn't been made yet do at the mean time...WATCH PUPPIES!
04But since Luna's dad is providing the server, will we need the cloud feature?
*Pony bowl gets made*
08,01Luna: what exactly is your dad providing us with?
yea we do
Okay, time to watch the pony bowl
why wont the mods play something already?
08,01and for how long?
:(
when will some start streaming
well... he saw... the machine running paintchat and started crying..
Heavy Weapons Guy: POOTIS CUPCAKE!
04Oh my
Painis cupcake.
Lawl
Puppies>Ponies
>.>
Heheh
04That couldn't have been a nice sight ._.
are they gonna stream the superbowl
i have no idea 6_9
Hello.
6 year old lappy ghost
...
It's me.
046 years
How about they stream the super pony?
04man
08,01also, i'd just like to point out that designing infrastructure before developing our software is probably a more sensible approach than waiting
The one with AFK is fake.
Okay then.
08,01Shizuka: aye
It has had a long and arduous life.
:P
AAAAAH
Me
04Well of course, more communication will make it easier on all of us
Princess Celestia
When will someone be streaming?
/me is confus
04As Luna mentioned, it's a lesson learned
Cleverbot
/me is completely real
Princess Luna
/me doesn't know what Jim was trying to say
what :P
/me is real
08,01okay, lemme explain something about my EC2 idea before i go any further and ask luna some more questions
this entire department step.. is a huge step for bronystate
|AFK is the real one :P
08,01aye
remember it all started out of fun and giggles
No I am!
is confused
/me is singing
6_9
/whois does not lie :P
Start typing in the characters' names
08,01so EC2 is part of amazon's AWS, which provides services like i described above
your not the only one
I know! Ignore both of them
i suggest a drunken knife fight
08,01now, one of the great thigns about it is that you only pay for what you use
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME! :[
cool im in!
It's gonna be SO AWESOME
08,01and another great thign is that they have a free usage tier
Tarku: Give me question only real TOY_PON3 would know
TOY_PON32's i can tell which one of you is real
i actualy entered all those charecters
ok come at me mario_pony
"YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME!" that's what she said
08,01what this means for us, is that we can have a small server chugging away running our site for free for a year
Yes Tarku.
What's the bandwidth limit on the free usage tier?
Do it.
/me stabs alexxm in the kidney
i have a perfect question!
whenever you say some thing it remebers it im pretty sure
I'm backkkkk
both of you PM me
08,012 secs
slashs mario_ponys nose off
13on the order of many gigs i think..
Is the video down for everyone else?
welcome back Dashie_Dashie
08,01http://aws.amazon.com/free/
where do you live Toy
Dashie_Dashie!
1315 gig bandwidth
yes
hey where did the new guy go?
13and 30 gig storage? 35?
/me throws blodd at alexxms eyes
Fresno, California
drinks the blood
04Would that be able to handle our requests?
be more specific TOY_PON32
/me stabs alexxm in the leg
omg
hi
Okay.
Hmm
gmo
000 has 100GB bandwidth
um TOY_PON32|AFK is the real one!!
guess waht cb said to me?
Sorry if I may sound like an idiot, but how do you do those actions? 6_9
stabs mario_pony in the eye
what?
http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo124/AkimiTwilight/My%20Little%20Pony%20Friendship%20is%20Magic/u_mad_sorry.jpg
it's
Mods should totally stream the super bowl just for the commercial. :>
/me /me
08,01FUT gives us a small (1 core, 512mb memory) VM running 24/7, 30GB storage, an aditional 5gb of s3 (i'll get to that in a bit), 15gb out bandwidth
I already knew that fillyfillyy
i'm leaving the room now
OH.
08,01i think that's all that currently apply to us
mkay
TOY_PON32 and TOY_PON32|AFK : which nickname did i use when i first go there A.) coolguy_ncb B.) vinylscratch_ncb C.) String_Shredder
:(
i spammed cb with "princess luna"
/me punches alexxm in the face
*got here
08,01as you can probably see, one downside to AWS is that bandwidth on it is expensive
wow lol
and then typed in "derpy hooves"
So it knows Bon Bon
13well, build small
._.
A.
String_Shredder: C
stabs mario_pony in the nuts
and it asked me why i dont like Princess Luna
13the stream is still an iframe so as long as the rest was small
TOY_PON32 is right
:(
i was like "wtf"
dang!
/me tries to stop this war with friendship
/me cuts alexxm across the stomach
08,01but i think this is offset by the spec of the machien we get, the scalability, and rich featureset of everything else aws provides
You win this time TOY_PON32
08,01that we may or may not use in the future
so are we able to suggest videos?
cuts mario_pony's ears off
/me backstabs alexxm
/me cuts alexxm cutie mark off
next question!!!!!!! wat does "ncb" stand for according to when i first explained it????
08,01form my initial rough calculations, we should be able to stay within this for the most part
" running our site for free for a year" so what happens after a year? How much is it then?
mine said princess luna is best princess
00,10dont make me seprate you two
lol
did i even have one
08,01give or take
:D
Sumica: I didn't start it.
mine said that too
08,01again, that's very rough estimate
This is the end my alexxm, oh I'll be sad when you're gone... :3
good lord the VIOLENCE!
Princess Luna is BESTEST
/me says sorry and shakes alexxms hand
08,01if we go with this, we'll have to monitor our usage and make more accurate predictions
okay brb
and she is mai waifu
/me says sorry too
04$10 isn't bad
08,01after a year, we can either stay with AWS or move somewhere else
04We could all easily chip in for that amount
/me Uses Friendship Hug!
TOY_PON32 my full name is?
I'm visiting tonight
shakes mario_PONY'S HAND AND APPOLIGIZES AS WELL
It was super effective!
08,01or, er, make a new AWS account and use free tier again
it asked me what is princess lunas sister
Fine I admit that I'm fillyfilly! D:
08,01but it gives us plenty room to expand
say celly
WTH no
._.
lol
im fillyfillyy
see what it says
no i am
u gots some 'splainin' to do...
i have 2 Ys at the end
08,01but... this poses another problem
WHO'S THE REAL ONE?
like im supposed to
it said "what is love"
i dunno
ok I missed something
\_o_o_/
*facehoof*
lool
How much is the bandwidth if we go over the 15 GB limit?
08,01if we have money coming in and going out, we *really* need to be on top of it
Okay TOY_PON32, what is my organization that I made?
well if you are me TOY_PON32 how did i get this name
I AM sO CONFUSED!!!
LOOOOOOOOOOOOL

BURRRN
!
exactly, I knew TOY_PON32 wouldn't know
"IsNOTTOY_PON32"
Know what?
wut
08,01as this is a pay as you go service, we'd have to have some sort of "zomg, lots of traffic" contingency plan in terms of funds
wait Pinkie... if ur pink y do u explode into purple?
Oh, next question. What is me and fillyfillyy's secret society?
Maybe I explode into pink...
KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!
1,3good afternoon everypony :)

I lied again
I'm actually PinkiePie101!
SAY WHA-
ohai kirzstryfe
hai kirzstryfe
what are the benefts of AWS for us?
that was a coincidence, it sounded like he quoted rarity
No you're not!
>:o
i told it "Princess Luna is BESTEST pony!!!!!" and it said it will worship me
Yes I am!
Your a...clone!
Yes!
No
Yes
I'm the real one
maybe?
08,01scalability, and ease of use, mainly
You're a clone
No I am.
08,01also, reliability
No I am!
Nu-uh. Your the clone.
/me stabs TOY_PON32
08,01at those prices, you're looking at 99.9% uptime SLAs on anything else
I AM!
hat are they actually offering us that 000 doesn't do?
08,01AWS has 99.999%, i believe
/me punches PinkiePie101
/me pulls out gun and shoots at TOY_PON32
08,01ah, okay
well... we got a Sixth Day ripoff going on in the chat...
Thank god I'm not the real TOY_PON32
/me dodges
NO, I AM!
lol watching e 16 for the first time now i never make it to the premere :C
/me strikes again
I am!
I
freaking
am
08,01well, do you mind if i answer the more general question of a hosted service vs managing our own server?
i asked it what the airspeed of an unladen swallow is, it said "African or European?"
confused
/me sighs and hugs fillyfillyy
lol
/me also confused
oooh busted wing ouch
after this discussion let's get into a little more detail about my dad's server btw.
08,01aye
No, I'M confused!
Not you.
/me cheers and hugs IsNOTTOY_PON32 back
No
000 has 99.9% uptime too I'm fairly sure
I'M CONFUSED MORE
whats going on here
I'm confused even more!
Guys
BRB
13their free says 99, pro 99.9
I have a question for all of you
BronyKing: Identity crisis
monty python
Ah, 99%, ok.
what do u guys think of this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4xpOsCcWIw
Chimmy cherry, or cherry changa?
08,0199%? that's terrible...
fun
Chimmycherrychanga
both
I don't think the site has ever gone down though.
fun > secret butt fun > scary butt fun
/me burns the chat down with a flamethrower while dressed as a Pyro 'MMMPH MMMMMPH MMPH!!'
13but in the real world they generally amount to "always up" anyways... not like they take you down cause "oops we hit your 99% uptime"
neither, kumquat
08,01aye, but with uptime SLAs, the 9's really matter
wtf!? ponys heal broken bones in days? not weeks? mind= blown
I am PinkiePie101!
KUMQUATCHANGACHIMMYCHERRY
08,01it's the difference between being out 3 days in the year, and 3 minutes
ben1994: just a fracture, and RD is TOUGH
It knows Still Alive
If you're me
Then I'm you!
08,01aye
oh... rite
hiiiiz
And if you're me
Then I'm you!
And if you're me
otakon: Save me this chat is scaring me
Then I'm still you!
13but it's not like those 3 days would be right after each other, and even then what does that mean for us... miss a movie night?
And if you're me still
13and if it's spread out it's not bad either
;)
Then I'm you still!
morning #BronyState

And if you're-OKAY THIS IS GETTING OLD
Bah blank screen

its evening in england
1,3hehe :)
/me is scared
It's singing the Portal end credit song with me!
08,01with a hosted service, we have absolutely zero control over anything: issues with this have already arisen in terms of what extensions php was compiled with, what version of php was used
better one maybye
/me is revived
say whaaa-
what is going on
it's mid afternoon on the US East Coast
And if you're revived
whossss your fav pony

Sumica: I meant save it from this organized chaos
i love this song :P

Hi me!
rainbow dash "im an egg-head" dun dun dunnnnnnn 0_0

hiya thehated5689 RUN
Oh, I've got my swag cause I'm rainbow dash
http://www.existor.com/
13security is good though... the bigger we get, the more probable that the irc bot attacks would expand to attacking the site
phase4 i usually only have it f Haku or Acorn is on
08,01we can't do that with free webhosting
COMMON SENSE TIME
run?
ben1994: translation=I'm a brony!
ah
08,01exactly, shizu

Ok, I'm lost. Who's the filly faker?
BS 2.0 is no problem on 000 web?

well BN is not that far away ;)
start singing still alive line by line
13not *that* far, but far enough that there are more pressing things to get through now
08,01i'd like to think that BN could be as close as a month or two away
omg, that faker is still here!
huh. it the last scene of 'read it and weep' they forgot to put rd's wings on her
YEAH APPLEJACK, WOO HOO!

-_-
I'm back
u saw nothing
:(
Yes I did
c:
lol, nick fail
Yes we did! I have it print screened! *squee*
OMG im so confused which TOY_PON32 is real?
that gives me the time to talk to a friend who used or uses AWS atm
yay gi tthe / this time :D
I am
08,01okay, but the sooner we plan it, the less liekly it is to stagnate
04BN a month away?
i will settle this
04...I'm surprised
fillyfillyy: HMC
i am!!
c:
13^
thats all
08,01well, it could be! if we all put a lot of work into it
HMC???
evie says octavia is best pony :D
will the real toy pony please stand up?
let's launch BS 2.0 first ;)
08,01asye
/me stands up
13^^^^^
Ham Mane Crusaders
problem solved
I'm a chicken
/me sits down
now i have no idea which one is real
Someone let Fluttershy's chicken out.
13i have only three requirements for the backlog plugin, one of them might not be needed anymore
/me called sweetie belle
but you TOY_PON32 made one fatal mistake
13and another might not either if we figure out a workaround..
^
http://e-wot.com/2010/01/the-cake-recipe-portal/
/me stands up
/me facehoofs
we havent namesd our group yet!!!
Hey
How about
I named it!
Let's call it
HMC!
THE PIN TWINS?
wait what
cleaverbot has adhd
wait
Ham Maned Crusaders!
13but they are a recent version of PHP that supports DateTime::add(), GD, and write access to the backlog file (and maybe directory for posters)
I was scootaloo
:3
WHAT TIME IS THE NEXT STREAMMM
if i said operation: nom on hams who must be in the main chat?
I say we should go ahead and plan a BN meeting after we launched BS 2.0
Yo bro, I like your afro.
lol
wb fillyfillyy and xcanox
IshBestPony
Swimshine: no all caps, no stream right now and he got kicked
ha!
08,01shizu: either that or i could host BS2.0 on one of my servers until we make a decision about BN infrastructure
1,3that kid is not gonna last -.-
ok that is correct
If you're rainbow dash, you are the best pony
c:
ok how old am i?
1,3nah, he left on purpose, he's been jumping rooms
Guys, did you notice this in the new episode?
ah
Yeah! :D
Rarity said in the previous episode
29
probably a troll then
notice what?
"When I get back you're gonna get it rainbow dash..."
fillyfillyy: 15 years old
oh yeah
and then hospital
*rainbow dash ended up in the hospital next episode*
no
RD crashed
:D
1,3or some kid on a sugar high
\_o3o_/
that's all
Hmm. :/
and what math class am i in?
She used magic to make me crash.
08,01Luna: aye, but i think we should work on the assumption that whatever direction we take it in, we'll need at least a bit of capital behind us.
lol
:( I'm missing the puppy bowl
ohai otakon
brb, reading Daring Do!
13datetime i might be able to work around, maybe, and GD might not be necessary but i'll get to that
otakon: It was a hit Rarity put on her
Don't confuse me with your fancy mathematics
hiya Phase4
indeed we do, but like I said I don't mind chipping some funds..
Puppy bowl eh?
nope not possible
Twilight!
08,01to be honest, i'd rather not host it, as i don't actually have any i'd consider production environments
no magic aura
Tolver: its still on
How did you get here?!
conspiracy?
TOY_PON32 what math class am i in?
and no "curses" either
I have no idea, rainbow.
We'll be discussing funding when we discuss BN properly though
We didn't actually see RD crash.
besides
I'm scared.
we HEARD her
Hold me Twiligt.
08,01aye
fillyfillyy: Advanced Alg. 2
TOY_PON32 is real!!
/me holds RainbowDash
Whats wrong?
Of course
Have you been reading cupcakes lately...?
These...other ponies...
had to be sure

They say Rarity made me crash...
Wow.
cleverbot is "derpy"
Seriously?
08,01though i have a server that i'd consider reliable enough to host bs2.0 for a few months
Yes...
Okay then.
Well
/me uses magic to make RainbowDash feel better
There. c:
*squee*
/me sits back and drinks cider
08,01okay, let's move on with bs2.0
i ask who is best pony it says 'my little pony'
08,01i was going to talk about a streaming server
lol
08,01but honestly, with BN coming up, i don't really see th epoint anymore
Pinkie pie: Hey dashie, want some cider?
Rainbow Dash: *squee*
08,01i mean, we're quite happy with our stream embeds, right?
*Pinkie pie dumps the cider*
08,01oh, wait, iw as gonna talk about that too
Pinkie pie: Umad?
:3
13mips causes grumbles now and then, but everyone knows to get adblock to solve it
08,01oh, shit, i meant to do some benchmarking this week
Ffffffffffuuuuuu-
PINKIE PIE!
(why I oughta...)
08,01okay, next week, i want to do some benchmarking of stream embeds
/me whispers to rainbow dash
08,01because we're getting very varying performance on some
otakon i see what you meant by wierd
"kill her."
>_>
08,01particularly when it involves intercontinental CDN
CleverBot's speaking in tongues!
/me whispers back
"So it is cupcakes the other way around."
eyeah
"are you serious?"
08,01so i'll make a survey and get viewers to fill it out
oh no
not here
"It's not like you can make me kill her, anyway."
seriously
Please don't go there
Sprachentze Deustch?
Silence?
do not
1,3so yeah, www.bronystate.net/rules
08,01on stream laggyness, geographic location, etc.
1,3read them
hiya kirzstryfe, finally a voice of reason!
#_____
cupcakes = Kick (possibly ban)
wait, what am I saying?
1,3lol
you can't talk about cupcakes fanfic!
08,01do any of you notice any stream crappiness?
yeah, it's a rule
08,01or rather, how much do you notice?
08,01and under what circumstances?
it causes too much drama
1,3No cupcakes or similar content, www.bronystate.net/rules
13keeping in mind also that most internet surveys are going to tend towards the extremes... "it's fine" or "it totally sucks"
What if we do it in another channel?
#PonyRP ?
13as long as it's not one of ours
08,01aye, but even that's useful
Generally the streams are fine for me.
we could.. add it to the lotto survey
for once
1,3can't just let me work on my picture can you >.<
Hmhmm.
hm
08,01Luna: actually, i'd like to do it in realtime, so people can comment on how the stream is at a certain time
no stream?
08,01so i can make inferences about why it's like that
awkward turn of events made things awkward
awkward silence that is.
akward!
eeyup
/me stretches again and gets back to work
hiya Flaria
13i vote putting it in newsletter tomorrow, people that pay attention will give feedback, people who don't will probably ignore it and just be watching the stream anyway
so um.... what now.
/me spins and hugs Cy and otakon before going back
pokemon!
/me hugs Flaria back
/me hugs Flaria
What is this aiming to achieve?
LETS BATTLE!
RAINBOW DASH, I CHOOSE YOU!
hello again, i'm distracted from my distractions thismorning
/me explodes right before the battle
/me sumons snorlax
evie said Rainbow dash doesn't stand a chance to Luna
owwww
Oh sh-
#PonyRP
'ey SuperBrony64.
08,01there are some streaming services that are consitently bad that i think we shoudl drop, or some we should use more than others
08,01or for specific purposes
/me glomps SuperBrony64
08,01i'd like to see what each one's strengths and weaknesses are
Hey SuperBrony64
f
j-just battle....
x.x
08,01it's rather pernickity, but i think it'll reduce overall complaint about lag
Psst, TwilightSparkle, #PonyRP
Oh...
Umm...
Open google translate in one tab, then constantly switch the language you're speaking to Cleverbot in.
Twi?
Language tag.
/me is dead.
/me kisses Twi
...
guys
RP
/me is going brb now.
you go
hey]
do that dere
have fun
1,3Please do not advertise other channels
08,01anyhoos, i'll get that organised tonight or tomorrow afternoon
So what's next?
08,01moving swiftly on to my last item...
04Dari would know more about that, probably
/me yawns and does homework
/me 11,01touches RainbowDash and TwilightSparkle
so.....
Hey guys! I found a cool channel called #awesomechannel !
O_O
bah, homework
and hey Acorn :D
It doesn't even exsist!
07,01xcanox you troll :P
hey hated
That's how awesome it is!@
ohai [SWAG]DisplasedAcorn
I don't know, I don't know anything about it. I was told about it after I returned from being away, so I didn't have any influence in decisions about it or any information about what it will do, and when it will be finished.
and xcanox
hey Nittany_Discord and Luna
hello phase
13not even sure how much it's being worked on, haven't seen him check in the site revamp group in a while
/me is back
so are you guys going to stream the super bowl :o?
Totally.
11,01Hi TOY_PON32
hello?
04In any case, he's in the tech room and I'd assume that he had been making some kind of progress.
08,01okay, how much of a "thing" is it right now? do we still need it, do we still want him on it, do we want one of us to implement something instead?
Dashie_Dashie: Who are you going for?
dem giants.
No, we shall stream the um...
football i think
Maybe the....
super pony?
:D?
TOY_PON32 SHED
Bronystate does not have the express written consent of the National Football Association
I just want to see it for the commercials.
Well I'm not really sure what it's supposed to do
Dashie_Dashie: Haha no
04In regards to that, his position was strictly temporary and once BS 2.0 was finished he was to leave
BronyKing: O U
lol
^
50 bucks on the patriots
crap, I blundered the joke.
08,01okay, because all he seems to do is just hang around the bs2.0 skype group
04And it's up to the tech team. If you think he's not doing much work, but his work could be salvageable then finish it.
I'm not twilight sparkle anymore :3
i typed *dies* it said *smiles*
National Football League
08,01not that i'm complaining about that; i just wan tto know what his role is
im with mario_pony on that one, though i dont pay to much attention to it
04We could probably talk to him about it after this meeting is over and see where he stands
10,02Ohai everypony ^_^
Patriots are gonna win either way
08,01aye
..........
There's the official Super Bowl stream here, http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/46/live/sunday?module=HP11_more_now
I'm gonna go now.
hello!!
1,3hey
hola Superbrony64
Bye everypony!
GIANTS all the way
Well, there will be.
hey SB
ohai SuperBrony64
. . . . . . .
hi SB
/me hugs SuperBrony64 "oh hai der"
ohai SB
?....
08,01if he doesn't have the time to finish it, i have a bot that can be extended with the functionality we want
first time i am here saw this chat like stream on youtube today
multiple dots
ohai SuperBrony64
how goes it robot?
yeah
/me has a GIANT cooler full of beer for everypony
What would it do that I haven't already written scripts for though?
SuperBrony64: Do you liek poniez?
1,3welcome :)
i found it funny to see how the room was like all crazy when Derpy talked ^^
/me takes one "Cheers TopHat"
08,01to be honest, i have no idea. i did know before, but i can't remember
well i just decided to replay one of my games
which one
08,01what *was* his bot meant to do?
Cheers :)
rules enforcement.. I believe was part of it
13that i know of, DumbFabric's spec was to watch for colors, kick for spam, and synchronize bans across the mane six channels
1,3most of the chat happens in the #bronystate channel, the side channels are usually pretty quiet when there's not an episode or movies running
Giants? Ha you ponies are hilarious.
ratchet and clank future:tools of destruction
08,01but... daribot pretty much does that
/me drinks cocacola instead
i hope i can get here when the new episode come out
how are you?
yea then there's no real use
BTW nice to meet yas
huh, turns out i cant see the superbowl streams from australia. how unfortunate :P
For once, we'll have a boring Superbowl.
/me drinks caprisun *underage*
10,02Eugggh...ponies?
hiya SuperBrony64!
10,02i liek poniez :3
inb4 the beer turns out to be moose urine
lol
08,01actually, that's a point, i had a small suggestion for daribot: instead of ignoring colour by name, could you get it to ignore by privilige level?
:3
tastes about right
08,01i.e., voice and above aren't enforced
1,3:)
need to shower. hopefully it's actually 10 minutes today
08,01for colour kicking and rate limiting
1,3the new episodes get pretty crazy
13apart from that, what i would want out of an irc bot would be a command when streaming, to sync up channel topics and maybe post to twitter (and a "now streaming" banner on BS2.0)
doin fine, jus bored
I'm Canadian. It's Canadian beer
It ignores by name and rank, maybe I didn't add voice to the ignor
ignore*
it might be moose urine >.>
08,01ah, okay
yeah i love the Brony community
Give me a sec, I'll check it.
my clock is next to the computer just quietly ticking away
i typed *pulls out gun* it said *pulls out god*
oh i do have a question for BS 2.0
that would drive me crazy
08,01does it also ignore for rate limiting, or just for colours?
to bad i dont live in New york i wanted to go to the Bronycon
tick.tick.tick....ikr
what about the lighning system?
Yay Kitty halftime show :3
I'll take a lok
look&
traffic lights*
what channel is it on?
Hmm
1,3well, good news is there seems to be a lot of groups popping up all over the place
08,01oh, bugger, yes, that was something i wanted to discuss too
^
animal planet
so did ya catch the last show?
new episode?
im on commercials :C
Oh... right... this was going...
13what were the lights supposed to be for?
of MLP
08,01okay, so i'm actually thinking a bot might be a good idea
Same
hey y rn u doin HW
i'm too hightech and lazy for normal clocks
it's not on till 4 overhere
Well originally.
yeah i life in holland and i was invited in a brony meet here it was so much fun
13they were only green forever and a day and now just blank
XLVI = 46?
i caught you TOY_PON32 the jig is up
all you have is digital?
Most of ours are normal and THERE WAS A NEW EPISODE!
The IRC script would set channels to invite only when one had too many more than the others.
I'm doing it but it's on either way
For the main 6 channels.
08,01it could report channel activity and be used for stream/twitter update like shizu said
>_>
still talkin on here
loololol
yea, yesterday
got to go bye
>.>
I liked it..
better watch it
it was nice to balance the rooms
1,3going to have a meetup at the comic/anime convention here in 2 weeks, should be a good time
And then the bot would update a file which would result in the traffic light becoming red.
i loool alot
13ahhh
now RBD / TS / Fluttershy are stuffed
hell yeah u should
/me goes to do homework
08,01i could code up some js to do what the flash currently does, using data exposed by the irc bot
Or yellow, if it were nearly at the limit.
this time forealzies
The problem was
When we had a pony ep
/me calls TOY_PON32 on his bluff
It just froze up my PC, since the xml file for the traffic lights was just hosted locally on my PC.
alright guys
alright i am
I'm out for now
see you all later
Have fun otakon
good... good...
Later otakon
It was the easiest way I could update the XML file from IRC
bye!!
going to a super bowl party
bye
08,01okay, i can think of a better way of doing that
kool
go patriots!!
;ater ota... oh poo to slow
08,01an irc bot could be running somewhere (thi sis something that *would* sit quite happilly on one of my servers)
ahd typod
herpaderp
08,01it would monitor, not by number of users, but by traffic volume
when a friend told me about MLP FiM i was like 6_9 but when i watched epi1 i was like meh 2nd epi still meh but then it was like 3, poof last episode
imma try to find a random MC server
Suggestion: use a single IRC Bot for all the channels
13^^^^^
08,01aye
Already do
No use having 2-4 different bots
reading is for eggheads? but i like to read :)
13i think that's what dumbfabric aimed to achieve
Since I'm in all the channels
And
The scripts run in all the channels
13rather than scripts out of dari's client
i mean :(
One bot
1,3lol, that's how it's been for a lot of people
08,01my bot has the code in place to do that already
its was like Hook line and Stinker
It needs to be able to be configured over DCC
Eggdrop style
still i think to many people think worng about us
Ie. disable certain commands, set limits, etc
08,01aye
I just set that up for commands in the mod channel
1,3it's unfortunate, but not all that unexpected
So !command off !command on etc
But no one ever used the commands anyway. :P
13we also don't know about them...
1,3many people lock themselves into their own little worldview and never try anything new or different, and if anything I feel sorry for them
well there is a group that wants to hate something just to hate on those people
where is everypony
Well, the scripts were written a while back
Frankly, I didn't even know we had a VCS in place
I told the mods back then
None of them ever used them.
08,01okay, so waht should we do about the traffic lights? are we going with bot/js, or darixml, or scrapping, or what?
So everyone just kind of forgot about them
Nor was I aware of using pogoplug
superbowl party ? is that like a tupperware party ? but for large bowls only ?
13from a recently-a-viewer perspective, daribot is only there to watch and kick for colors, and to beat you for 6 messages in 10 seconds, that's all anyone ever sees of daribot
Phase4 I found your cave
04I was under the impression that the lights don't work, and unless we can get them properly up and running then I say we should scrap it
Can't we use channel flags for limiting flood?
The lights used to work
But I turned them off
True i feel sorry for them because well they just dont see what the "bronies" do we do good stuff like give money to charity and stuff
you found my cave?
13yes dift
Diftraku: Not as for as I know onf shadowIRCd
Like I said I liked the lights
I asked the IRCops a while ago
13you can, let me grab docs
08,01Ghosties: well, i'm proposing rewriting the system using a bot
And they pretty much told me no
wishes he had friends to parrty with
I found your cave
Well, the IRCd on Canternet supports exceptions
outa ma cave!
04Dari, would you be okay with a bot controlling the lights?
Because I asked if they had something like +f on unrealIRCd
Like allowing ops to use colors
And they didn't
13https://bitbucket.org/uranium/shadowircd/raw/ef3b9dff52cb/help/opers/cmode unless they've modified the IRCd, you can
/me bats Jim over the head with a broom
Ghosties: A bot already does control them. :P
But I'm hiding from zombies!
It's just turned off
this is what clever bot said
What is your favorite kind of pie?Pinkie Pie.My favorites Fluttershy.
13you can set up a forward channel, people that can't join channel A due to invite or join limiting or whatever instead join channel B
try the cave next door, they got some spare room
04Why was it turned off originally?
NNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRDDDD
thank u:)
I turned it off because I couldn't host the file on my PC with 1000s of people coming from pony eps
And the IRC bot had to write to the file
Can't I stay the night? Zombies will eat me brains
And the easiest way for it to write to the file was if I hosted it locally for the traffic lights to get it.
/me facehoofs
Unless you got a gigabit line
I don't recommend doing it
13yeah you don't want to host our high volume stuff off a residential line...
Heheh, that's why I turned it off.
but i just love the show and i just cant w8 till next saterday/sunday
Hallo
1,3hehe :)
i loved the songs they use in season 2
08,01so what's the verdict? scrap or keep? because if we keep it, i say we rewrite it.
ohai Ziltoidian
1,3I love the Rarity songs personally
I am a zombie....
But yeah, I don't see a mode like unreal's +f in the docs for shadow.
Danial ingram makes good music
Hi....
brains are 20% tastier...
lemme geuss Art of the dress?
13+f Forward - Forwards users who cannot join because of +i j l or r
Have a cron run every 5 minutes to scrape channel usage and update the load on the website
Not the same as unreal's +f Shizuka.
13unreal's a straight flood protection isn't it?
You have to remember, this is shadowIRCd
Unreal's is a filter for kicking if a certain number of messages are sent in a number of seconds.
Yeah.
shadow doesn't have it which is why I wrote the script for daribot.
13yeah that... not going to work here... just look at the derpy reactions
yo
08,01Diftraku: ooor, just use a simple ajax call to an irc bot...
13oooooor
Whats up
1,3I like Becoming Popular more, but I do like both
13irc bot pokes a serverside script now and then with user count
So are we keeping the traffic lights or not?
You have to remember the file will be hit constantly
1,3amazing VA to sing to the music
yeah Becoming Popular is a pretty sweet song
13assume not, not at least for initial BS2.0 deployment
thats also why i love the series is because of the VA and the singers
If needed I can edit the traffic lights though, I still have the flas around somewhere
Having it as a static file on the webserver that's updated with a cron job is waaaaay more effective than polling the bot directly
13^
You have to remember
lol
We're talking about possibly 4-5k people here
lol
That's 4-5k hits at minimum to the bot
funny comic
08,01aye, couple of thousand people, got it
Wait, how is your bot supposed to work?
With response times of 50ms to the ajax it will slow it down
13yeah we're having a lot of conflicting ideas here...
BTW kirz where do you live?
The originaly way was all the bot had to do was +i the channel if it had too many people, and update the file to reflect that the channel was closed.
Which isn't taxing on the bot at all.
It was just because I couldn't host the file
picked up some more game stuff from a game store thats closing up
13^ rather than update file, poke a script serverside that updates, same functionality, less load
cherrychanga
08,01aye
chimmycherry
Let Apache do what it does best
Serve content
08,01post to a server side script
Cool...like what
chimmy cherry cherry chonga? chimmycherrychinga!!
13not post, just get, add a key to the end
08,01changing values, use post
oh just some boxed console displays
kumquat kumquat!
13you're just sending "i locked this channel"
08,01yes, you're changing a value, so you use post
1,3Florida, USA
okay cool
08,01that's what it's there for
also.. speaking about balancing the load.. what about the maneroom? can we in somehow delay the messages in there?
i thought it was cumquat not kumquat
hows the weather there?
during pony eps... it's hard to moderate it
no ur right its kumquat
1,3definitely not winter lol
That's the problem with mane
It just won't work during pony eps
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumquat
To limit the messages it means leaving annoying mode changes for people not using the chat embed.
Not too bad
Too many people on it
08,01um... i have a daft suggestion
1,3hasn't gone below 50 F more than 3 times this year >.<
did any of you ever have a dream where you had kinda meh superpowers ?
/me is listening
Either +q or +/-v
08,01maybe mute mane during pony episodes
sigh cant say i didnt see the ending of e 16 comeing great story tho :)
^
und enforce m6?
We have 6 channels
08,01that way, people won't have a central place to be all talky in
yeah can say that agian its cold here in holland like -11 degrees at night
1,3brr :(
08,01and it'll effecively auto load balance based on the distribution of peoples pony choices
Well I'm gonna go watch the superbowl, see you ponies later.
Though we lose stuff like chat reaction videos to the eps.
13it'd be easier to spread us out over six channels with less people than six plus mane with everyone
04You want to mute main chat? That's...pretty daft
We wouldn't have stuff like the mass 'derpy' chat reaction.
BTW whats the timer for>?
have fun dashie_dashie
13the reaction video was pinkie pie room only though wasn't it
And that got us a quite a lot of PR.
im watching the puppy bowl :D
08,01oh, well, i guess
the vid was made in the pinkie room :)
not the main room
Oh.
04...gotta admit, I'm not a fan of muting main
08,01though we'd still get those reacionts, just more spread out over the 6 channels
Yeah, the idea was always to delay main, not mute entirely.
I once had a dream where I could fly, but only intermittently. Or were talking about powers more like Milk Man's?
08,01the reason mane gets so much chat is that it's specifically designated as the main room
what's the puppy bowl?
13you can't delay messages, even unreal's flood protection is per-user, and we need per-channel
Well we can
But if floods mode changes
08,01if you force people to use 6 equal biased rooms, they'll spread themselves out
it*
Which is fine for people using the chat embed.
were puppies play football
08,01if you say "this one is the main one" they'll all use that
But for people using proper clients it's a bit annoying.
its something put on by animal planit and they put a bunch of puppies in a little thing that looks like an arena and they put a ball in there and they kind of play
just go watch it
13okay, reading modes for what's possible, here's my suggestion
eeee
touchdown!
is it for the next MLP?
no flying works , i had a dream recently where i had some telekinesis , i could levitate small objects and kinda hover just above ground , not very exciting but that would be soooo useful for ... fetching a beer , the remote ....
a puppy doing a touchdown? Neat
13take the mane six rooms, put them in some random list, set +l <some limit> on them all, +f <channel> to the next in the list
13no bot required, but on the other hand no way to update lights
Problem with that is we never know how many people we'll get.
they held the ball in their mouth and crossed into the inzone
And if we assume it'll be around 5k
13for instance, the absurdly low limit of 100 in #rainbow_dash, the 101st person gets sent to twilight instead
We'll end up with one room really full of people first before any of the others get users
If I had telekinesis just strong enough to turn the steering wheel, I'd be in heaven.
13yes
BOOM!
1,3hmm
13but as more join, they get pushed along
BANG!
08,01Shizuka: but if oyu're only doing that with the 6 rooms, the mane chanenl will still be flood-o-rama
POW!
1,3I think it's set for the friday night movie stream right now
another touchdown :D
oh wait i tought that was at the HOME part right?
nice episode
13then add +m to mane chat, or +i and +g for the pony ep
the movie
08,01i think a combination of that plus +m for mane
08,01aye
#101
Well... we could have a round-robin to force people to the less loaded channels
does the timer also keep track when the next MLP epi comes?
1,3the front page shows the current newsletter, the movies get streamed through the same page as the episodes
1,3it does
Brain....
08,01i like shizuka's idea
giveme Brains!
cool
08,01especially of +i rather than +m
If they want to, say, join #RBD, let them
1,3it just doesn't get changed to that timer until after the friday movies end
my video isn't working.
08,01once we reach, say, 500 in mane, we +i
Also, disable knocks on mane
If you set +i
08,01aye
Why would we +i main?
i really hope i can be here when it starts
/me gives brain to zombiedash
13does shadow even have knocks?
Everyone is supposed to be in main.
That's the point of it
Well
WAIT ZombieDash dont eat that derpybrain , you gonna get a wicked bad tummy ache
It doesn't work
It's a fucking disaster zone
So you mean +m
Not +io
+i*
/me eats Derpy brain anyway
13+i to prevent new joins, but also +g so that people in mane can invite others
/me helps nom the brain
Again, that's pointless.
08,01and let them filter to the other 6 channels
/me eats everyone's brain
+m makes more sense
More brains...
Everyone is supposed to be in main
13dari you're not listening
Otherwise it isn't main
hmmm you know the HUB has alot of commercials 6_9 thats kinda irritating
/me is now brain less.................
13if mane chat is too flooded for us to do our jobs there and watch the mane six channels
i lost my brain yesterday
:D
Im so bored :/
/me needs brain back
does no one remember
Main would then become just another one of the main6 channels.
my brain blew up :(
13it's still main during the week
l im going 2 leave. bai
so...how bout that Puppy Bowl?
08,01^
yep
+m makes more sense than +i, there's no point in it being the main channel if you're going to +i it.
13please everyone keep in mind we're talking about a half hour span of time, maybe more before
08,01this is just for pony episodes
whats this feeling ....h=gaaaaa guuuuuuuh waaaaaaaaaaa yaaaaaaaaaaaaa
it's not on till 3
04Why don't we lock the mane6 during the week and BMN and then open them up during the new pony eps?
/me is now a zombie
13that too
mine is full of f*** , you dont want to eat that
mario_pony: it's on right now for me.
08,01*+m
lol RAWRity you know you wana watch it too
I'll have to agree with dari, here...but that's just me
Mane would remain mane for the week, and during pony eps, mane would be restricted, leaving the satellite channels to have the load spreaded
fillyfillyy: implying I'm not watching it right now.
where are you?
^
hahaaa
East Coast
1,3the station is largely ad-driven, can't avoid it :(
08,01exactly
13^
uhuh
Hello everypony!
Since I don't know about you, but the mane is unreadable during a pony ep
ohai Discord
And it sucks
Considering most of the talking happens in main, we'd probably end up with 6 unmoderateable channels instead of 1.
08,01it'd mean that the first n people in mane would still get to talk
what about "message throttling"? That was one concept we never got to implement...
so rarity is you fav pony?
whats up with those bowls ? and whats in them ? potatoe salad ?
08,01rather than no-one getting to talk
13can't throttle messages
the wallaby can and will
We can
04That's why I'm saying we should lock the mane6 during the week and then open them again during new eps
/me corrupts Jim for saying something to him
rawr
TrixieMuffin: no, just Puppies
04You could switch off, actually
As of now, they'll be a lot less conversation, and a lot more killing.
hello
You say manageable, I'm not so sure.
5000/6 is better than 5000/1
08,01Ghosties: no mane 6 during the week, but no mane during the pony episode?
dari-o had a plan for that if I'm not mistaken
Guys, I'm having tacos for supper
didn't even bother to lurk
Oh you, bronystate is filled with the power of friendship, that won't work here ^_^
04During pony eps, main is muted or locked but main6 is open. During the week, mane6 is locked but main chat is open
1,3Vinyl Scratch actually
Not if 5000/6 means 6 unmanageable compared to 5000/1 1 unmanageable.
haha
Eat well TopHat
why is there no stream
ikr
FRIENDSHIP is magic
13you're still not listening..
alexxm: cus
1,3I just keep an eye on all of the channels around here :)
04I say this because it seems like there's a lot of leaks and cracks that trolls and other neerdowells can enter from with the mane6
ok
Yes I am Shizuka.
13there would not be 5000 in each of the mane six
I just don't agree.
hehe
Yes it willl!
I'm Discord!
13there would be significantly less than that in each of the mane six, adding up to 5000
08,01to be fair 5000/6 is still a lot of people
^ exactly.
Suuuuuuure
BRAAAAAAAAAAAINS:[
are you the nicer version?
11,01As am I.
And I'm saying 5000/6 is 6 unmanageable numbers.
Nittany_Discord is the real discord
Where as just 5000 is one unmanageable number.
08,01but i think it'd be more managable now because we have new mods
deal with it
Nu uh.
I am.
orly?
that just means it has a 50/50 chance of working , no matter the odds ^^
08,015000 is unworkable, 1000 * 6 just requires more people
i am!!
13which we have
There gets to a certain point, where however many mods you have, the chat is impossible to moderate.
08,01exactly
I am!
11,01Now, now. I always welcome a little company.
sorry, still kind of working on ebay stuff
He's the faker.
And I think 800 people is beyond that limit.
08,01but i don't think ~1000 is that point
/me curls up in ball in corner and naps
13why are you out of uniform
Because I ate my uniform.
/me softyl pets FillyFillyy
/me 11,01jumps on top of Discord's head.
That's why.
08,01i remember when there were ~1500 in the chat; it seemed okay to me
:D
08,01not too fast to be unmoddable
1,3>.>
Get off my head, faker.
There is only ONE true chaos maker here, and that is ME.
*snore*
/me noms fillys brine while napping
08,01and we have the manpower now to scale mods horizontally across the channels
13ident you silly filly~
*brain
/me glomps Nittany_Discord
**squee
During a pony ep, given the amount that people type, I'd be surprised if it were not turbo chat.
Discord: I thought it was I
I am the real Discord.
08,01instead of vertically in one clusterfuck of 5000 people
^
Sir, I will corrupt any one here.
Ohai der MakerDusk
/me dreams of meeting the mane6
the chat as it is now is a huge stressfactor.. if we could balance the load... that would be lovely
okay Discord, do me
04^
Okay!
13bringing in ghosties idea of reforming mods in charge of certain rooms too
Hey.
04Yes
yeah?
04We need to get that situated
fillyfillyy: that's what dreams are for
Everyone thinks your the worst chat owner ever.
13DarthNigger: please choose a more respectful nick
04We had that idea originally, but it kind of fell to pieces
dashie is the softest to hug
yep
Look at all your friends, teasing you behind your back.
Anyway, +m the main room, I'm fine with, but not +i.
XD chat owner?
/me filly lses body parts untill she is gone wakes up in cold sweat to find is really missing her leg :/
+m it is then
04If we lock out main room during pony ep, we could really concentrate on the other rooms
DERPY TALKED
Well, mod.
lol Ishaq
/me 11,01discords kirz|art
da fuq are you talking about?
13good boy..
1,3<3
Im not a mod. XD
we just need to INFORM our viewers
Well...
member.
04Though I do have one small question
I think he's looking for me
Whatever.
Sure
I'm happy! I'm jolly!
Haha no its fine
Anyone, everyone hates you.
there is one thing we're not considering right there
I'm not a mod either ^_^
Look, everyone doesn't care about you.
13dusky is an ircop
13he sort of outranks everyone
ben1994....she??? im deeply hurt
Yesterday, Wrek told me you were the worst person he SAW on this chat.
did i say she?
stalking you mean
crop
11,01Now, where was I before I was rudely interrupted? Ah, yes.
yes u said she and her
Shizuka: am not, this network has no IRCops... we haven't seen the need
dillop
sry im bad at that
/me 11,01steps on Discord's head. Lovelly view.
04What about my idea of locking out the mane6 during the week? My reasoning is so that we could keep trolls out of those rooms that is usually weakly moderated or looked after. RBD room in particular is a lawless wasteland full of banditos and renegades
Shut up fake me, I'm TRYING to corrupt someone. >.>
Discord is free from the stone?
XD
13network admin, oper, ircop, it's all the same to the general public, you have the power to do anything
/me pokes Discord off my head
what happened here?
true that
/me 11,01hops.
I'm the true chaos around here.
08,01yeah, good idea
04By forcing them into main chat during the week, we can root them out much easily
Your just a waffle to everyone else.
11,01Now now, no need to ruin a fellow draconnequus' fun.
and that is "viewer reaction"....some viewers might love the idea. Others could hate it....we have to somehow make sure it doesn't become an "unpopular decision".
i get it u have to assume on here sometimes dont u ben1994
And yes, I did say waffle.
No idea.
MakerDusk litterally could do circles around yo in this chat Discord XD
*you
:/ yea...
You appear to be op
/me pokes Nittany Discord
04We could test it ^
I'm the real one.
/me 11,01explodes
04Let's try for one week and judge viewer reaction
See?
Good point DCD.
He was fake.
04Because I thought about that too
08,01to be honest, i think this is more an executive decision that needs to be made based on how well we can mod the channels
I don't explode.
I also don't turn ponies into stone.
11,01He's right. I'm too chaotic!
though I do agree with Mane 6 Weekday lockdown
not particularly stalking, not really
he knows about this net
Yeah, channel has unregistered for some reason, it seems.
XD
11,01Of course. Stone ponies are boring.
yeah i guess his logic is sound :/
But I might have to turn a draconnequus into stone.
11,01Try cheese ponies.
04We don't need to piss them off
you should register it just to piss off SR :P
what DO you turn ponies into ?
NS!
/me explodes because he is too dictracted to stop it
nope, we don't want to stress out or mods either
I turn them into waffles.
I haven seen you for a few days D:
Lawl
it should be win/win :)
That sounds delicious
but im already a muffin
Then I give them to whatever, and ponies eat ponies.
11,01Waffles? Waffles? Why?
Because waffles are good.
That's why.
11,01Oh, that never works.
08,01though, i can't see many people thinking this is a bad idea
11,01Ponies don't like waffles.
Cupcakes!!!
Of course they do.
Hell naw
08,01you can't get a word in edgeways at the moment on a saturday morning
11,01Especially pony-shaped waffles.
04As mentioned, I suggest we try this idea for a week and see how it goes
08,01any step is a step up
where is Pinkie when you need her
Well then;
08,01aye
sure, works for me
I'll turn them into colourful sparkly rainbows.
down*
04But are we in agreement with locking the main6 during the week and then muting main room during new ep?
That sounds fun
You cant get on my bad side ,because i only have good sides . You can get on my bedside however!
rainbows are SPICY!!!
The channel's just unregistered for some reason. O_o
but we have to inform them via the newsletter or in another way?
I'll give them to Rainbow Dash, and she'll do it.
11,01Cannibalism is above me. There is no chaos in cannibalism.
(In the rainbow factory)
08,01Ghosties: i still think it should be +i rather than +m
Oh god...
But there's a C in cannibalism.
Is it just some reregister issue?
13+i mane six during week with +f #bronystate, +m mane chat during pony ep with mane six open
As there is in Chaos.
You'll have to remember you can't be kissing everyone's ass
But anyway,
Wow, that logic
Mai gawd
/me 11,01flicks Discord, turning him into a rainbow.
Eventually, somepony won't like some of the changes we make
do it filly :3
also true
04This isn't kissing ass, Dift. This is making sure we don't drive away our lifeblood
That's something you have to keep in mind
Oh please, that only works on Luna.
13they're called #brony >>
04^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
04THAT
11,01No grimdark fanfic discussion. Also, you don't need ponies for rainbows.
04We do NOT want shit to escalate with them
13sorry did i say that out loud .-.
04I'm telling you
hey Trixie so me some magic
04We need diplomacy and tact
08,01shizu <3
But you do need THIS for rainbows.
/me pulls out a Nintendo 3DS
okay, next point? :)
XD
08,01well, that's all i had
13well... they're also outside our jurisdiction, we can't go through every decision trying not to rile them up, cause they'll do that on their own
04Shizu?
/me does'nt want another 8.5hrs meeting..
11,01I've created rainbows with objects as simple as water droplets and the sun itself.
I have one point.
this was made in the 1st century by ME.
04And that's ture
13if they start escalating, we must call in opers, that's all there is to it
04Oh, Luna?
I presume you also invented bread?
I was wondering.. which requirement does the BS server need?
No idea
I invented you, little one.
As in processor / memory und what not
I have a question?
/me casts the want it need it spell on herself
What?
mufffin!!!!
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
it's a bitch on icechat
i'll just copy pasta that to dad :)
the chicken lol
scootaloo
"Did you hear they were going to use Troy Ackman for the new Twilight movie?" "... buck Twilight... AND BUCK THIS ELEVATOR!" :[
We currently have a MUCH better standing with #brony....and 50% of the time their criticisms held a degree of truth in it. We should use that constructively.
08,01processor doesn't really matter that much; anything over 512mb ram should be fine; so far as space goes... it depends on how much content we serve
trixie your G A P T
I laugh so hard every time I watch that
512... lal.. that's no problem
so no quadcore and what not?
who's troy ackman?
I have to apply it each time, and I cba to learn how to do the script for it
or even if icechat supports that kind of thing
more ist better?
08,01well, if he's offering >.>
Football player?
What server we talking about?
a big derp
hah
13not much to process, depends on what wordpress' specs are
Yep
well paintchat will run on it too
+ vi's radio thingy
He REALLY hates elevators apparently
6_9 serping into infinity be back never
and since the epic-chat website has been down forever, as well as absent from mibbit I really have no choice but icechat
08,01okay, let's not be so conservative in our estimates, jus tin case
indeed
I want a Disco TARDIS
08,01say, dual core with 2gb ram
Have dance parties while in deep space
i want a dancing black man
11,01Psst, game consoles?
08,01that'll handle paintchat and our stuff fine
PC

Tardis parties are the best parties

You came first.

I REALLY feel like playing Kingdom Hearts 2
I'm the Discord from BEFORE.

But not the Nittanity one.
The other one.
11,01Yes, there are two mes, but don't get confused on who is who.
Hmm
I'm him.
He's me.
11,01We are alike with all but personality and looks.
It's as simple as can be.
[NOTICE] There is already a user named Discord: You are now identified as Discord_

-_-
You know you can manually enter network addresses into mibbit to join them? :P
I think he came first dude
That was a good game

13we pay for 12/4, we get more down and less up though...
I have some terrible news.
08,01also, if you can tell me wha tISP you're with, where in the country you are, and what technology your connection uses, that'd be helpful
13i don't trust speedtest at all because comcast throttles up the first x bytes of a transfer, which conveniently falls within speedtest's range
Very terrible.
fibercon / netherlands / edutel bv
Do you want to hear this terrible news?
No
Okay, here it goes;

Hi everypony!
XDDDDDD
08,01um, guys, i just remembered something
we had to get spike to light a flame in there
Awkward
08,01i have a server at uni

wait...
wow, just wow.:|
that's better

What sort of server you got then?
:P

08,012gb ram, i think
Captian Picard?
Yup
/me tries to corrupt Nittany_Discord
08,01only problem is it's currently sitting in a cupboard, rather than a rack, but i can get it set up in a few weeks
08,01or less
http://www.ovh.co.uk/dedicated_servers/
wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle YEAH!
08,01basically, i need to go through a load of paperwork to use the compsci facilities
Ohh Celestia, you always were so... boring...
Those are few dedicated servers for comparison
but yea what's it gonna be?
/me noms Nittany_Discord
we're going OTR
off topic -r

/me is still trying to corrupt Nittany_Discord
*chirp chirp*
anypony know a Radio host called GHOST?
Yes.
No
He's the last part of your name with ass added onto it.
11,01*shrug*
Hey!
The more power we have, the less we have to worry about the server coughing blood when shit goes down
Straw!
girl look at that body, girl look at that body,girl look at that body, i work out!
/me noms the cricket
I'm not finished with you, Nittany_Discord !
/me chases after Nitttany Discord
11,01I'm not running.
i kinda wanna Ask him why he hates bronies
08,01aye, i think if luna's dad's gonna get a server anyway, that'd be a good place to host
08,01the connection seems fine for us
awesome
Regarding BS 2.0 then.
been so busy
11,01Ghost probably hates bronies because A) They troll him. B) He's conservative.
and school
Did anyone else have anything to say?
Hai
13my topics are 50% content
13http://pastebin.com/BdpACpgY
Not all conservatives hate bronies
Nittany Discord, can I say something to you?
You just did
11,01Sure.
That's essentially what we don't want to happen
This sentence is false!
13rules in particular needs to be much clearer, don't think we'll go over that today but that will need to be ready before deployment, especially if we're looking at next week
Pinkie representing users and Rarity the server
11,01OK.
Rules aren't really something fora tech meeting, yeah.
i'll schedule another R&R meeting
13but it's content
with your feedback
Umm... True...
OK, that was easy.
13my main point is that if we're keeping the dropdowns everywhere, then rules *must* have a clear header line, then details
/me is nomd
No!
It's a paradox you idiot! There is no answer!
It's a paradox!
There is no answer!
11,01OK.
i think Ghost has the Wrong idea about bronies
Umm, False
I'm a bit opposed to the dropdown
Well we could always just do the rules without dropdown
Instead, have a ToC
11,01The follow sentence is true. The previous sentence is false.
If I don't get back into my body the entire facility will self destruct!
Easy.
Both have no answer.
With clickable links that point to the appropriate part in the page
moob u melted my eyes _.
11,01If you confine yourself to logic, you'll find yourself confused.
11,01Also, chaos is illogical.
Ain't that the truth..
11,01Except with chaos systems.
13i feel the advantage to the dropdowns is it gets the gist of the rules across quickly, with details available
when i walk on by, girls be looking like "damnhe fly"
13having everything all at once just looks like your standard TOS, and no one reads TOS ever
That song...
^
:'(
i love that Q was the voice of Discord it was so fitting
13if our goal is to have all viewers reading the rules before the jump in, we need readability
It hurts my ears
For rules I don't think dropdowns are good. They have to click to open every single part of the rules, and most members can't be bothered to start with.
Indeed it is
so should we register the channel?
13^ this is why i say they *must* have a clear header
08,01i agree with shizuka here
/me snaps
It's much better to have something they can glance at and easily read without having to actually do anything.
Aha!
13No Trolling rather than Being a Parasprite
I know!
Now if you'll excuse me, I have some chaos to wreak!
13No Non-Image Links During Stream rather than Links in Chat
Content of the rules isn't really something for discussion here.
08,01a short summary
Hey Nittany_Discord , guess what
08,01then click for clarification
How we display them is, but content of them, no.
hey!
13again, the point is we can still have details, but the headers absolutely must be clear
Yo!
11,01Yes?
its just the chara discord looked so much like Q snaping his fingers ( claws)
Chicken butt
No one likes you or your chaos.
I'M SEXY AND I KNOW IT":P
It's terrible.
13such that they could be the whole rules page on their own if they had to be
I would call your chaos not chaos.
/me 11,01hugs the Discord collective.
It makes everyone happy.
Not sad.
So just give up.
11,01Everyone's here. Let's have fun.
We are Discord
I think dropdowns are a really bad idea for rules to be honest.
THOU, ART GOING TO LOVE US!
The number of people who will bother to open up all these separate dropdowns are likely to be few and far inbetween.
The chaos disease is spreading.
11,01Oh silly, having chaos is about not caring what others think. You have to let emotional chaos loose as well.
13it was specced in dift's list of 'things to fix' when i was brought on, just following issues
11,01It's all part of the fun.
I give up
/me gets corrupted
Now I will dedicate my life to making everyone HAPPY!
:D
13but consider also... say a rule of Chat is rated TV-14, dropdown has a clearer description of what that means
Yaaaaaaaay!
pfft
08,01i disagree; i think a short, concise summary of the rules, with clarification on clicking, will make more people understand the rules, by giving them the oppurtunity to give thema cursory glance
When I'm Chaotic
/me drop it!
11,01Oh well. Chaos isn't for everyone.
/me 11,01dances
The user shouldn't have to 'do' anything to be able to receive the rules.
i suggest a drunken knife fight
08,01er, that is to say, i disagree with dari, no shizuka
That is a VERY bad idea.
No! I didn't say dance! I said drop it!
11,01Ohh, yeah.
13they aren't doing anything, the headers will be clear enough
13but if they want more information they can get it
I’m lucky you didn’t mean me, you remember thou is singular ;)
/me becomes un corrupted and dance
13the rules are as much a resource for us as them too
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qwRbOm2Pvg&feature=related
/me hits the stero
It is if they don't get a clear idea from just the header.
I hate that song.
i really like you be my private dancer our bodys moving
13then. make. the. header. clear.
And however clear the header is to you, it most likely won't be to other people.
When I'm bored
Everyone will interpret it differently.
Let's listen to this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R677MV--WI
Sometimes more clarification than just a couple of words is needed.
So many discords in here
eeyup
08,01"no gore, no porn, no colours, don't be a dick" <-- pretty clear
To you maybe.
I say...
When i'm Magic
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJP11_BkU8Q
Should listen to - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVBcm_BZRs&feature=fvwrel
/me has a sad
My little metal!
08,01i don't think i'd want to chat with someone to whom that is not clear...
"5DON'T BE A COMPLETE, PEDANTIC DICKWEED AND/OR ASSHAT"
13there comes a point of clarity that if they still don't get it, and still still don't get it after the dropdown, they're only here to troll
Considering most users don't even read the rules, thinking they'll want to clarify these headers is laughable.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajxyWHz3VtA&feature=related
/me hands MasterBrony 2 happies
/me mmm, yeah!
They should receive the full rules without having to work for it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R677MV--WI&feature=related
13which brings me to a point brought up at last week's meeting and not on my list
/me has 2 happies and a sad
when i am MD http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c16MROw6veI&lc=xB82Egjdt_XX0hUNcFmp_stts_Kse988E8jSAEf0rws&context=G2d17f5aFAAAAAAAADAA&feature=g-all-c
I'll have to side with Shizu and Sat here
The sumaries will still be there for them to read, in bold, big text, just with explanations beneath each.
Oh right...
because TL; DR
The explanations for the summaries will be easier to access.
Therefore more likely to be read.
Qweb IRC can be hacked to have customized emoticons
I know I wouldn't read it
13headers are better discussed at a rules meeting, i'm just here to take whatever comes in and make it code
I support Dr. Fluttershy
08,01example: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/
I am real Discord
Nope
I fail at life
13you guys can argue until you're blue in the face, but please not while i want to get my topics out before we're all too tired to care
i loved that song of DR house
The rules there are outlined exactly as I say.
1,3?
08,01vs: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/legalcode
Why is the countdown timer at the top wrong?
Not how you are
/me snaps
You are saying they should have to work to receive the explanations
better
Because I did it.
Dooooooi.
Where as on the first link you posted, the explanations are just there in plain text.
For all to see.
2 days in a row, I turn what is supposed to be a 10-minute shower into an hour-long ordeal.
08,01waaay less text
08,01okay, maybe not waaay
We aren't discussing the content of the rules now.
08,01but less.
I've said that already.
08,01no, we're disscusing UE
1,3eh, it happens sometimes
so many discords
I should put like, Avatar or something in a seperate window so I can have that "stream" feel
But...
13no, we're arguing UE
13and wasting time
2 days in a row?
Next topic!
If we are not discussing the content of the rules, why are you talking about the amount of texT?
That is irrelevant.
Leave this for latter
13DARI
my reaction to latest ep: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-the-newest-episode.png
We're down to Discord and Nittany I believe
13thank you
Hiii yah!
The point is dropdowns vs plain text.
13About Us and History pages on my site, is the copy good as is?
Pokemon battle!
Why leave it for later?
hello!!
We haven't come to a decision?
oh great.
That is the point of the meeting
To make decisions.
Because we're wasting time on a single bucking thing
So now Mario is dressed as Discord.
08,01okay, all in favour of dropdowns say aye
watch. next thing you know, it'll be 2 hour-long 10 minute showers in one day.
I know!
08,01aye.
RAWRity: +3 internets for Pinkiebama
1,3if there's nothing else going on, yeah
there!
13not taking a vote, this can be better argued at a rules meeting
^
13if they decide paragraphs is best, then that's what i put up
I'm going to corrupt you both in a minute or two.
13if they decide short headers with details is best, then that's what i put up
Indiana Pones
08,01fair enough
And a minute to me is a second or two. ;)
Fine.
13i have been trying to get feedback on content for weeks
and the temple of Doom!
DOOM!
13About Us and History pages, is the content good and up to date as is?
13considering it is apparently from many months ago now
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&list=PL837883F65F45179A&v=i4Ykf4R8lLM
screw it i changed it back
DOOOOOOM!!!!

What's all this discord talk?
Join us!!!
Hey guys is this dropdown like "hover over header get box with extra info while your mouse sits there"? Cause that'd be awesome. Anyways carry on this is just me being a slow typist on phone.
Nope not today
You have to click each dropdown to open them separately.
Good night everypony
Do it or die.

Hello guise

/me corrupts SuperBrony64
There.
so, somepony should totally stream the Puppy Bowl now, just so we can take bets on who Best Puppy is.
i is discord king
10,02O U
Buck puppies
RAWRity: no, that is the dumbest idea I've ever heard
/me spots an SB and glomps him to nom his tail
No seriously.
That's awesome Moop ^^
10,02U IS ALL SILLY :3
unless they'er puppies OF WAR
Your corrupted.
1,3site mod
10,02My tail O__o
Jim thanks :)
emantrollslayer: pah, philistines.
1,3hehe, just wait until I finish this picture SB ;)
/me corrupts SuperBrony64
/me slays RAWRity "this has been long overdue"
You are corrupted.
And you shall do chaos.
kirz|art: what's it of?
kirz|art can i see progress so far?
/me slaps Discord around with a herring, that's my SB
13http://du.cx/shizuka/?page_id=4 good? yes? no? up to date?
emantrollslayer: you cannot slay what cannot die!
1,3it's still a sketch, no digital version yet
1,3involves SB being nomm'd on
/me slays RAWRity anyway because BUCK logic
/me corrupts Kirz|art
Most epic thing ever? : http://www.obviouswinner.com/storage/post-images/epic-win-boba-fett.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1321285261532
Oh your sketching it on paper then scanning it?
/me nomms on kirz|art's pic accidentally eating it
you're*
1,3yeah, that's not gonna do much Discord ;) :p
sorry, I just dont know what went wrong
emantrollslayer: all you're managing to do is dull your battle axe, it doesn't even harm me.
contact us is not up to date
1 hour till Super Bowl i so excite
04Will there still be a history page?
What?!
RAWRity: who said I had an ax
13http://du.cx/shizuka/?page_id=6 history page
04Good
13i believe the decision from last week was to move former mod information to History
well you can't slay trolls without one. Any other intrument only serves to temporarilly disolve them.
1,3sketch, scan, then touch it up digitally, add color, etc
then they come back more powerful than ever.
RAWRity: no I slay them using my pure concentrated power of will
>Touch it up digitally.
Mental image engaged.
04I recall leaving former mods out, but I could be wrong
emantrollslayer: so you throw dandelions at them, then?
04For that matter, the only one I'd really acknowledge is Hipster
hey mr/mrs/ms mod.....
RAWRity: didn't you know? dandelions are acid to the troll
why is there no stream?
emantrollslayer: eenope.
13former mods won't be on the main mods page anymore, but we could remove altogether
Lawl
:P
emantrollslayer: that calls for you taking a chill pill
13i think that was still up in the air, whether to remove former mods altogether or move to History page
ummmmmm....
I just love him ok?
toys, not spoilers
inb4 candence isnt pink either
1,3nobody's available to stream anything
cadence'
1,3the usual reason why there wouldn't be a stream ;)
i didnt know that lol
im new here
i thought it was borked:P
I say move them
somepony who's nick starts with S just joined
1,3nah, unless VioletVanilla is doing her radio show it's usually slow on Sundays
wow this chat is ded....
why dont YOU stream?
1,3plus with the superbowl I think most of the other streamers are busy
like a wise philosopher once said "Time is Candy
1,3I don't have the connection to support it unfortunately
has anyone seen the crow
football is boring...i like watching chess :D
http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyw7p1wFap1r1b6b6o1_400.gif
brb, i hear true blood theme on TV downstairs.
1,3lol
I see twilight knows how cod players play
I'm not busy (don't need football), but don't know how to stream
I'm so bored...
love the sound board lol
1,3yeah, I don't follow football, I'm just working on a picture right now
13all in favor of moving former mods to history page
and soccer too!
when i'm bored
13aye
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAALLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RAWRity: dont you wish you were victoryful at so many things like I am?
i can stream..i work 12hr shifts on sunday
aye
a spy just joined
/me shrugs "aye"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkj9uTEnz64
and have access to the interwebz
why don't we take down a brony hater site
Fine.
lets make poetry on how the stream is still loading, 4th.
11am to 11pm
we should stream the super bowl
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Xx62U0GW9ew
emantrollslayer: nah, I wouldn't like to be succesful at failure.
Because we love and tolerate
like actually
1,3lol
RAWRity: dat contridiction
hi
thats REALLY illegal
pirating is one thing
13former mods will be moved to history page, is the content there otherwise good and up to date?
even though they tried to take us down Jim
yeah thats true XD
1,3pretty sure they run their own stream you have to pay for
Yeah, we shouldn't steep down to their level
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-so-thats-what-she-does.png
...they have a Parrot at the Puppy Bowl using twitter.
the superbowl is a whole nother game (no pun intended)
forget the actual superbowl, stream the commercials.
puppy bowl's on!!
emantrollslayer: posted it already
Don't they sync the stream to one time zone's time slots?
RAWRity: I know but there are new people that weren't online when you posted it
Commercials would cause legal issues too
SO THERE
04History really needs to be updated
emantrollslayer: always following in my footsteps.
13job for the lit department?
People make serious money betting on these football games.
we need to add something bout live eps yeah
definently
well kirz....as an offer
RAWRity: always being a soulless dick
i can stream on sundays if yall want
oh D:
just an offer
uhhh
04Luna is known as Sathi in the history
1,3lol
04Yeah, it needs to be really updated
ends say, 2pm est, relatives call to cali, cali residents bank off it
04I could probably get something to Val and see if he wants to rewrite the history for us
1,3only certain mods and techies get to stream, there's a level of trust there for accessing the site's accounts
emantrollslayer: well, I would hope my penis doesn't have its own soul. That'd just be weird.
ok....well if i earn it..the offer is still valid
sure
Half OPs were streaming yesterday...
oh god it's too cute!!
Like SlurryMoon
RAWRity: in that context dick was an adjective used to describe your personality
1,3technically they were being restreamed by SB
just saw a TV ad for The Secret World of Arrietty. Can't wait!
technically :p
If anyone doesn't understand why, reason 1: Anonymous
so much this: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/8e83aeab-df90-48c2-aa07-7c2a8d80bb9c.jpg
i really think they need some kind of schedule for streaming
13should they update About Us too?
Why can't MLP be more like that^
like "person on on Mon and Tue" etc
emantrollslayer: technically you used "dick" as a noun. "Soulless" was the adjective in that sentence.
one on*
1,3it's been tried, having a set schedule locks down that person during those times, and if something comes up it causes issues
Don't you confuse me with your fancy mathematic
ok
puppies!!!
was just an ide
idea
RAWRity: you can have two adjectives describing the same noun. in that sentence RAWRity was the noun
1,3we're working on some stuff to make it easier to know when streams are starting up and running
who the f:[k came up with ..has been doubled jokes about differentiation???
The internet police are here! http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ez-OJ4zPfC8
is it a sad goal to be a mod somewhere?
emantrollslayer: the way you constructed the sentence, "Dick" is indeed a noun.
thats like one of my goals in life
Soooooooooooooooooooo topic change... Super Bowl?
sucks
wtf did i put "like
Yes and no, i think
"
Puppy Bowl
XD
i have my own forum
that thing is adorable
XD
i like puppy bowl better... fund it!
but
but serious -_-
Pony Bowl
super bowl
there is NEVER anyone on it
so thats as close as i get ot being a mod
i am srs... sucks, prefer baseball
.....a dead web forum
1,3if it's something you like, go for it, but it's usually a lot of work
PUPPIES!!!!
i dont mind work
thats your opinion I guess :p
10,02i liek puppies :3
Super Bowl will be boring, broken up by 30 mins of terrible brought to us by Madonna, LMFAO, and Nicki Minaj
10,02With that said, brb.
im on teh interwebz like 8-12 hrs a day
1,3if/when we do need more mods, the announcement usually goes out in the weekly newsletter
i kinda like madona.a
are there certain criteria necessary?
RAWRity: At least Kelly Clarkson starts it off
http://snfallaccess.nbcsports.com/ SuperBowl livestream
Good stuff DiscordKing, but imma watch it on TV
If your goal is to be a mod in a specific place, then it would suck to be a mod for something without life canging results
RAWRity: Who cares about relevance? Shes good :p
i just care abput who wins and the commercials.
13may as well, so... task for Lit department: Rewrite/update About Us and History pages, due by end of next week assuming we're aiming to deploy then
GIANTS
*about
they should have Rebecca Black sing at half time
1,3maturity and responsibility are big things, how long you've been a part of the community, how you've behaved, availability, plus a lot of other different things
no!
so a noob like me has no chance huh?
RAWRity: ... just watch for the commercials at least -_-
:D
13http://du.cx/shizuka/?page_id=25 mods page, will be updated to move former mods to History (need to confirm who that means)
1,3usually no one thing will make or break your chances
1,3:p
yeah, sounds about right
that would be great moop
they should have fluttershy.
pinkie pie
1,3if you stick around, by the time we're looking again you won't be a noob ;)
13are we sticking with the Location/Favorite Pony/Favorite Movie/Duties layout, want to add anything, and is it up to date for all the current mods?
both
Derpy
would it be playing favs if i asked you to look at my mod app and tell me what to change?
I don't like adverts.
13and shall i continue with the ornaments or shall we switch back to avatars
everypony
:O
one site i tried for wanted a 500 word essay as a mod app
and i still have it
Ornaments look good to me.
RAWRity thats the reason most people watch it
But on the plus side, getting to mod status is serious work, and as such, is a good kind of goal to set as it requires diligence
Quality over quantity my friend
Moop: well, those people are easily ammused I guess. Never understood the "watching it for the ads" thing.
ornaments is a grand idwa. I want to modi
*modify mine though : 3
yeah like sometimes they show trailers for movies that are gonna be out.
RAWRity: i get amused by looking at paint dry
13http://s13.zetaboards.com/BronyState/topic/6880917/ i also have a thread up asking the newbies for details
08,01i'm back
Avengers!!!
When I was asked the question "Why?" on my Philosophy final, 500 words means nothing when you could just write "because"
trailers I can watch online? AWESOME!
I did so and got an A+ :p
do yall want to read my app?
Brotip: asskissing will get you nowhere.
as for Former Mods.....Denied Existence, Octavia, Shy, RobotPinkie, Hipster, Flutterpeanut...who else?
sssteal my info and ill make sure you "expire"
no trailers that are only shown their first.
XD
i dont asskiss
I wouldnt do that
lol
i tell it how it is
in a polite manner
goood good
much luck to you.
any one else using Tor?
MasterBrony: I wouldnt worry about applications until the oppertunity presents itself
him too
Is Silverscreen still with us or not?
im sorry what?
so...watching 4+ hours of a game for 2 mins of video that will be available online the next day?
eenope
yep
yea he is
just inactive
Tor a search engine that makes u untrackable by any one
05UBCF: Istanbul would be the name of my brony starship
same as RBD
I don't get people.
well
being prepared never hurts
RAWRity: How am im not suprised?
*I
I <3 Turkey
yeah but if you see it you can go online and tell everyone who hasn't seen it yet.
<3 chicken
The day Silverscreen returns, as the prophecies have foretold, shall be a glorious one.
that is the best name for a starship Wrek
sorry *everypony
1,3it'd probably be better if I didn't, I don't know who would be looking them over, and it'd be unfair to other apps if I had looked your over before
indeed Wrek
ok
thats why i asked
11,01Everyone and everypony is welcome here.
i dont want anyone to play favs
i hate that crap
mario_pony: and I'm sure all those people on the internet will be very jealous.
thanks anyway tho
FootBall http://duckbar.mirror.waffleimages.com/files/bf/bfd31b86b449057acb49467be3deed3e23aff762.png
Anyway, moving on.
What's next?
I would spend less time worrying about the app and get to know the users here better to see how you ft in and what you can do to benefit BronysState
it's weird i always crave apples when i watch my little pony.
13looking at the thread, i said to list duties if they know what they are, is everyone accurate so far?
Why, apples are delicious
Waffle images sounds like my kinda place
mario_pony: it means you're slowly turning into Applejack.
i crave human flesh
And when the oppertunity presents itself, you already have an idea of what your writing about
13(same for current mods, maybe a mention of which department you're in?)
The duties sections aren't very accurate anyway, haven't updated them for a long time
Moop: john madden
^^^
makes sense.
Moop: well then, the latest MLP video from hot Diggedy Demon must be for you.
13which is why it's on my list
08,01crap, must abscond again; i'll catch up when i'm back
Phase4: aeiou
1,3best thing you can do is just have fun :)
the last apps just wanted to know about myself and what about them would make me a good mod
SHED
damn, cant load that image, internet to slow
RAWRity: there are no humans in MLP
i'm on the fun boat
indeed kirz|art
Moop: that's what you think.
/me nomz Kirz
RAWRity... brb apples
/me noms with agreement ^_^
There are humans in MLP, but not in FiM
1,3me, I'm the silly one :)
Did you say... Silly?
As in...
SILLY FILLY?!?!?!
/me nomnomnomnomnom
:3
Jim: that is true
i like silly fillies
:O
1,3Glomp PILE!
/me starts a glomp pile on Wrek
they are cute
and awesome
so does Big Macintosh.
/me hops on glomp pile
:D
/me glomps Wrek
MasterBrony: then Ive got the channel for you m friend
specifically, three silly fillies.
13so if i could get a canon list of duties for everyone, maybe add a line for department (department leads?) would be great
glops Wrek with knife
big mac is teh bestest stallion
ohyes.
he's red so
im not a big cmc fan
of course, he wins
duh

hi
13the only other thing i have is a couple things on the backlog
