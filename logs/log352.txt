not famillier with that
08,01it's an anonymising service
'night
08,01so anything you do over it can't be traced back to you
08,01buuuut
08,01it also has another useful purpose
08,01it provices a pseudo-top-level-domain, .onion
08,01so you can host hidden services on it
08,01PHASE4!
SATURN!
08,01wow, our nicks have the same length

08,01including services and a nifty little web client
/me mumbles, 'i liek poniez'
/me slowly drifts off to sleep
thats right! tor is the one that uses onion
gimi a sec, got most of a tor client setup on my laptop somewhere
http://www.flashflashrevolution.com/FFR_the_Game.php beat me in multiplayer here.
neat, its just pacman -S tor and then start the daemon
wow, musta been doing something real stupid last time i tryed
-sigh- maybe shoulda did it earlier than 4 am -_-
well if no pony wants to challenge my skill, then i guess i have no reason to be here for now.
08,01wait a minute...
08,01they made a 3rd missioni impossible film?
Saturn: got it running, that was trivial. comeing out somewhere in germeny

Not if we can do something about it :P
How are everyone?
I woke up at 2:30 pm today, but that's because I fell asleep at 7:30 am
good, one of my puppies doesn't seem to want to eat his food for some reason
not sure why
┻━┻ ︵╰(°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
you tried letting the other sniff his food?
O_o
yea, but she still doesn't want to eat it
she used to get definsive about it, but now doesn't even care
oO
Maybe she's just not hungry or it's just that she's in a grumpy mood
been able to get her to eat by hand though
ooo ok
I guess, thanks for filling in i suppose
well if she does eat when you feed her directly it has to do with discipline rather than schedule/health
Yeah
So...How about them ponies?
ponies you say?
It was hilarious, you should have been there
watching old Jeoparty show - category is Networking (names several programs, you name the network)
the answer: "Teen Titans," "SAmurai Jack," "Cow and Chicken."
Oh my, that's awesome
I agree
me!
whoops episode
^
7 est yes
Cheeeeese.
incrediously silly
but it's all in good fun
Did you like it Saturn
08,01and honestly, it looks like Anusbis mated with one of H.R. Geiger's aliens
08,01*Anubis
Lol rainbow dash=epic tact
I must say, Battle Clouds, do want
08,01anyhoos, the episode earns 6.5/10 on the Saturn scale
I was expecting a great episode, but it's still good nonetheless
they hide their addiction
08,01next week is a fluttersode, yes?
I was all like "Dude...PONIES" when I first discovered my obsession
I think it's the valentine's episode next
lol
08,01bronyfan: well, horses are matriarchal by tradition
08,01it's kinda ingrained into their culture
08,01i would like to cuddle a fluttershy
I think there are more stallions in appaloosa, not sure though
lol
You nice person
I think horses are warmer than humans?
08,01Randomnerd: i've heard from... a source... that this is the case
Between 99.8 and 101.3
F
one of my little cousins has a dvd of the show, she knows few of the characters
I hope you mean a Vet, Saturn.
08,01pah, use a sensible mesure like Kelvin
i have yet to have a cousion thats a little girl like this show
08,01Randomnerd: for sanity's sake, shall we assume i do?
I know right, Kelvin all the way
Saturn: Very good.
08,01bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh
I've been going out with a girl recently, she thinks it's adorable.
but I suspected it since she only has the dvd
But she watches lots of cartoons.
08,01that's my bruh face
08,01pah, girls
08,01what do they know about ponies...
ikr?
lol
/me facehooves
Bow chicka wow wow
whee!
I've probably got to clean some more, had pizza/movenight yesterday
movie*
*Epic Sarcasm* Brony?...I'm afraid I am unfamiliar with the term...
08,01i hate
08,01ahem
I think it's fine -I'm strange about language.
We do it, but it's technically dumb.
08,01Jim: no
08,01i just think that
08,01 people are a bit too stuck in gender binaries and political correctness sometimes
The one fanbase. To rule, them ALL.
as if
Well, it's stuck now regardless.
like my name suggests
08,01i call girls "dude" all the time
^this
^
And they've never complained?
:)
You know more easy-going women than I do, lol
:P *chuck testa
The only one I've ever heard complaining about being called "dudes" are just those very stuck up ones
You know more easy-going MEN than I do, as well. lol
I usually call everyone my dear or dearie at some point IRL
08,01Randomnerd: no, they're just manlier
I don't call anyone by affectionate terms, come to think of it.
not atm
I used to call my girlfriend by her first name, rather than anything affectionate.
I was pretty void of emotions untill recently
don't we call everypony by their first name?
08,01i call my brother f**ktard, but that's mainly because he is, on the whole, a f**ktard.
classy
oh kays
lol
thinking.jpg
08,01Randomnerd: i used to call my ex "wench"
+s
trolol
brony=male,pegasister=female
correct me if i'm wrong
you're right
:D
08,01bronyfan: you're wrong
I have never used the term "Brony" out loud, anyway. I say "Fan of MLP"
:(
only if you want to be really specific
I prefer the generalization
they don't know yet
08,01i dunno, to me, making that distinction is like saying that Rainbow Dash must be a lesbian because she's a tomboy and has a rainbow mane
girl-:D :D :D whos the best pony? boy-(none yet)
my cousins on the other hand think I am weird, but they always thought of me like that
oh yea RD is a tomboy
Anyway, the divirgent personalities of the Mane 6 demonstrate there's no WRONG way to be a girl.
:O yuk!
08,01then painted with a glaze of tolerence
Rainbow Dash isn't a lesbian because she likes athletics any more than Pinkie Pie is housewife because she bakes.
Simple as that
08,01Randomnerd: yes, but you can't deny that she *is* a gypsy
08,01s/op/oo/
08,01and then was proven wrong in my assumptions
yup
lol
:-)

Some fields still have real turf.

Untrue.

You can't be obnoxious, otherwise the other team would murder you.
umm... fail emote? :D
I'm imagioning battles between France and Britain were fought like gentlemen
>:D
i don't understand
Animal Planet has a little special called "The Puppy Bowl"
The english longbow was more than accurate enough
They round up a bunch of puppies, put them in a football themed room and let them run around for an hour
Yeomen never sniped French Knights, though. They filled the air with arrows
Except for the Half Time show, where they let kittens run around for ten minutes

Saturn: think us championship
Favorite superbowl commercial?
Ive never watched a superbowl
and to that I can't answer
Bud light
00,10I watch it for the advertisments
...
me too
00,10and halftime
*ignores*
08,01NullRadix: football? for some reaosn i thought it was baseball related
American Football*
Saturn: :/
argh
00,10baseball is spring
I forgot to specify, AMERICAN football
08,01which one's the baseball one?
go ahead and ignore, you are doing my job for me
World Series
HOW long has Soccer been called football?
00,10world serise
Saturn: World Series but that's a misnomer
08,01oh, and by football you mean that rugby for wusses thing you yanks play?
Saturn: yes
:/
08,01heh, armour...
He's pregnant.
he's a druggy!
00,10right "armor"
that doesn't really work that well
08,01colourful armour.
bc there are still TONS of injuries
back
Rainbow in a wheelchair? This is too much; I would never be able to think of such
08,01yeah, we don't tend to wear that here
08,01wait, hang on, which one's the one where they only play for like 10 minutes?
i feel like this is an older episode
no
the rhymes are starting to get worse, i just hope the dont get perverse
it's an hour
dat NEC
08,01well, it's an "hour", but it's really just 10 minutes
15 minute sessions
Rugby is more intuitive than Gridiron Football.
00,10dont know of any sport with a 10min clock
08,01i can't remember if that's "football" or baseball
it's neither
00,10Baseball plays till it's over
08,01to be honest i wouldn't be able to tell the two apart anyway
But they're pretty tough without their padding.
Baseball is by plays
Football is time and plays IIRC
00,10football is 15 min quarters
A football play lasts about 10 seconds followed by a break.
08,01what if you play a quarter too long?
08,01will you ever get that quarter back?
I'd start listening again if they did.
Saturn: it stops during some times
good evening ;3
Perhaps i should dial it down; i don't want to drive you out of town
where's football for dummies?
08,01i know just enough about it to make terrible puns
It stops if you go out of bounds.
I think I remember hearing there are SPECIAL RULES to allow the clock to stop MORE often in the 4th quarter
Saturn: There's a Quarterback, Halfback, and Fullback.
08,01is that like the off-side rule?
damn
08,01Randomnerd: i had a halfback once. turned into a fullback and a lot of drinking.
:3 Good morinng Everypony.
they*
00,10off sides is crossing the line of scrimage before the play starts

08,01oh, that reminds me, are we going to start using redmine for this now?
Why the story book starting?

08,01*hassle
idk buecause it is a book lol
Ooh, it's daytime

:/

"Once upon a time, in the magical land of germany..."
brb mc
;?
Who's that purple pony???
:)
08,01also, next point, is rollout timeframe dependant on rollout timeframe of BN?
Stream bar gunna be in the theatre page?
08,01are we releasing them together?
08,01aye
both
http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF252-Carolyn.jpg
I'd say give them BS before we launch BN
Latte-chan is leaving now <3
it wants to go out with me 6_9
Baiiguise :)
if that makes sense
Wait...her name is Twilight?
bye
well the fandom is a interesting bunch
Yes
*skips off for her date*
04^
08,01yeah; BN is going to be a more protracted project
I can swear I've heard that from the 80's or something..
I though this was ver interesting http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=UE7I_IDX98g
R U high? RD is!
08,01at the Team Meeting, noises were made about releasing together
There was?
how should i respond
back in the 80's
http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF118-Missing_Grandfather.jpg
I don't think many team-members know about BN...
they only know I purchased the domain name in Dec
and the dragons called Spike?
08,01yeah... i'm going to come to that in a sec
do you pay or do i
Heard that one too.
yup
04Unless you count my lofty speech in G a while back
most of the characters are redone from G1
Is this show based off the 80's?
http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF090-Mrs._Hammer.jpg
05to an extent
Oh.
Yeah.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-the-big-lepony.jpg
Lol the part where his face is slammed on floor. xD

and TONS of fourth wall breaking
OH
08,01(not iuncluding testing)
fourth wall?
ooh
Pinkie pie usually breaks the fourth wall.
13backlog could be done by then

08,01right, moving on to BN
ok
hey
08,01unless anyone has anything else to add about bs2,0?/
11,01Hi.
hmmm
04I don't
Snails
stream ain't workin :'(
OH YEAH!
hi Nittany
Snails.

13nope
08,01excellent
Alright.
11,01Try this again.
11,01Hi.
hello!!
Hi.

The ONLY time there is going to be a stream is if there is a little live Icon on the player.
Hallo~
THEN and ONLY then is there a stream.
has anyone seen shed.mov?
we don't talk about it.
damn gotta go to work bye everypony
bye
bye!!
bye Pon!
08,01i think there are some things we could have done differently, and some other considerations we'd have taken with bs2.0 if we knew about BN
13like luna said all we know is the domain has been bought, but otherwise i didn't have any idea about it
BORRRRRRRINGGG!!!!!!!!
no idea
08,01okay
but they seemed to be digging the show
lol
the father of a 5 year old
Omg this show is awesome.
hey
Ponies + Perry Bible Fellowship = http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF222-Gamblin_Man.jpg
you can change you nick to something else
he's back
with /nick yournick here
Cool.
reply was ocho and endor base
are there any pegasisters here?
08,01aye, but i think that's soemthing that techies should have been involved in the discussion of
/me /nick yournickhere <it'll look like that
04And again, mods caught glimpses of it when I spoke that speech
that's awesome
no idea
cool.
I agree, that's a lesson learned for future plans
wait
ad
08,01aye
can we stream iz i saw my little boy watched that
but do they come here?
08,01aye, i understand
yeah
they do
but it's really come and go
no streamer atm
Wait...
yea
everypony run!
I am here. :3
:3
:3
08,01but anyhoos, enough bitching about that
I don't believe there was any bitching but I do appreciate the feedback.
still...........nothin6_9
08,01aye; also helps from a timescale perspective.... but moving on
http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF024-Puppy_Wish.gif
awkward silences happen sometimes
pinkie that is going to be confusing
deal with it.jpg
then ill change my name back
there
i am now typing "bacon" again and agian
if theres nothin to see here,i'm goin to lord of the rings online
have fun
k good luck with that
I'm watching YT atm
*sees the user "spy"*
Pony.
um...lol
I have no idea!
08,01000 are pretty good, but if we want to store content, and if we expect a higher rate of traffic, we're going to find ourselves very limited very quickly
04What do you propose?
08,01what i suggest is we either use paid hosting, or rent our own server/vps
bout to sign in
:'(
HUDDAHUDDAHAUDH
and then TF2
woah
6_9
04Hmm
That's something we were gunna discuss when we switched over to BN I think, because then we can actually start taking in money.
:$
exactly
[Insert TF2 theme here]
04Yep
04Then we can possibly market
08,01well, as i said in the group meeting, we can start making money now through merch sales and commissions
08,01but!
6_9
08,01kinda on the side
04I do not
No wait.
and now this place devolves into TF2 again
argh
<3 all the things
Yes...HATS good!
08,01or lots of instances, if you wish
Action hat simulator go!
sorta.
04cloudy...woudy
08,01it's very scalable and pretty cool
No.
/me tilts head
Just no.
that deosn;t mean we have to talk about ponies all the time
Puppy Bowl is on everypony
08,01oh!
08,01that solves a lot of problems!
04And I've heard of "cloud" but nothing much
Me too
Typed in My little pony
and I don't mind chipping in some funds too...
o.o
said to me
Oh wow.
this one hates it though
0_0
Watch the Puppy Bowl! >.>
08,01the virtual machines are abstracted away onto a cluster of computers
do you know you're all my very best friend
No, watch the pony bowl.
And bring a spoon.
a you are mine
i have very few friends
/me would watch the shit out of the pony bowl
same here
08,01so they can basically deliver things like virtualisation, storage, and content distribution as a service
04So you're saying you could use the software without actually being on the hardware or server it's installed on?
08,01platform as a service, i think it's called
04Interesting
Pony Bowl hasn't been made yet do at the mean time...WATCH PUPPIES!
08,01Shizuka: not necessarily; they *can* be, but with just one server, it'd be the opposite
yea we do
Okay, time to watch the pony bowl
why wont the mods play something already?
08,01and for how long?
:(
04Oh my
Lawl
Puppies>Ponies
>.>
Heheh
04That couldn't have been a nice sight ._.
are they gonna stream the superbowl
i have no idea 6_9
Hello.
...
It's me.
046 years
04man
08,01also, i'd just like to point out that designing infrastructure before developing our software is probably a more sensible approach than waiting
Okay then.
08,01Shizuka: aye
:P
AAAAAH
Me
/me is confus
04As Luna mentioned, it's a lesson learned
Cleverbot
/me is completely real
/me is real
08,01okay, lemme explain something about my EC2 idea before i go any further and ask luna some more questions
|AFK is the real one :P
08,01aye
No I am!
/me is singing
6_9
/whois does not lie :P
Start typing in the characters' names
08,01so EC2 is part of amazon's AWS, which provides services like i described above
I know! Ignore both of them
08,01and another great thign is that they have a free usage tier
TOY_PON32's i can tell which one of you is real
i actualy entered all those charecters
What's the bandwidth limit on the free usage tier?
Do it.
I'm backkkkk
both of you PM me
08,012 secs
slashs mario_ponys nose off
13on the order of many gigs i think..
08,01http://aws.amazon.com/free/
where do you live Toy
1315 gig bandwidth
yes
America.
13and 30 gig storage? 35?
/me throws blodd at alexxms eyes
Fresno, California
drinks the blood
04Would that be able to handle our requests?
omg
hi
Okay.
Hmm
gmo
000 has 100GB bandwidth
guess waht cb said to me?
Sorry if I may sound like an idiot, but how do you do those actions? 6_9
http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo124/AkimiTwilight/My%20Little%20Pony%20Friendship%20is%20Magic/u_mad_sorry.jpg
it's

i'm leaving the room now
America, California, Presno.
OH.
08,01i think that's all that currently apply to us
mkay
:(
i spammed cb with "princess luna"
*got here
08,01as you can probably see, one downside to AWS is that bandwidth on it is expensive
wow lol
and then typed in "derpy hooves"
._.
A.
:(
i was like "wtf"
dang!
08,01but i think this is offset by the spec of the machien we get, the scalability, and rich featureset of everything else aws provides
08,01that we may or may not use in the future
cuts mario_pony's ears off
08,01form my initial rough calculations, we should be able to stay within this for the most part
00,10dont make me seprate you two
lol
did i even have one
08,01prince-dari: i worked it out to be about $10/month
08,01give or take
:D
mine said that too
08,01again, that's very rough estimate
good lord the VIOLENCE!
/me says sorry and shakes alexxms hand
08,01if we go with this, we'll have to monitor our usage and make more accurate predictions
okay brb
and she is mai waifu
/me says sorry too
04$10 isn't bad
08,01after a year, we can either stay with AWS or move somewhere else
I'm visiting tonight
shakes mario_PONY'S HAND AND APPOLIGIZES AS WELL
Fine I admit that I'm fillyfilly! D:
08,01but it gives us plenty room to expand
say celly
WTH no
._.
lol
no i am
u gots some 'splainin' to do...
i have 2 Ys at the end
08,01but... this poses another problem
WHO'S THE REAL ONE?
it said "what is love"
i dunno
ok I missed something
\_o_o_/
*facehoof*
lool
How much is the bandwidth if we go over the 15 GB limit?
08,01if we have money coming in and going out, we *really* need to be on top of it
LOOOOOOOOOOOOL
08,01http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/

Hey look!

08,01the fact that this is a high profile vuln, and 000 still haven't patched it is... worrying

hahahahaah
Of course you do!
Yup
It's a song about me!
HERESY

I changed my name
Hey Everypony :D

08,01we can't do that with free webhosting
COMMON SENSE TIME
run?
Are we talking about this hosting for BN, or BS 2.0?
i know that one
13^
once i clicked the link
I'm back!
08,01BN
Hi!
no here
its a quote
in #bronystate
Hey!
I am back
MAster, CB knows still alive
trrolrorlrolrrolrol
/me exploded
BS 2.0 is no problem on 000 web?
13can we get back to BS2.0 then? seems to be BN is a long ways off, like past anniversary even
O
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R677MV--WI&feature=related
G
um
in case yu dint se it
08,01i'd recommend BS2.0 either remains on a seperate server, or at the very least a seperate IP address
not sure
oyus
/me AFK
pretty cool song
*facehoofs
spelling fail
WOOOOOO
Ugh I need to do homework!
I change my name too much D:
well BN is not that far away ;)
start singing still alive line by line
13not *that* far, but far enough that there are more pressing things to get through now
08,01i'd like to think that BN could be as close as a month or two away
omg, that faker is still here!
huh. it the last scene of 'read it and weep' they forgot to put rd's wings on her
YEAH APPLEJACK, WOO HOO!
:):):):):):):):):):)
but yea let's focus this meeting on BS
._.
-_-
I'm back
u saw nothing
:(
Yes I did
lol, nick fail
Yes we did! I have it print screened! *squee*
I am
08,01okay, but the sooner we plan it, the less liekly it is to stagnate
04BN a month away?
04...I'm surprised
i am!!
13^
thats all
08,01well, it could be! if we all put a lot of work into it
HMC???
let's launch BS 2.0 first ;)
08,01asye
/me stands up
13^^^^^
Ham Mane Crusaders
problem solved
/me sits down
now i have no idea which one is real
13i have only three requirements for the backlog plugin, one of them might not be needed anymore
13and another might not either if we figure out a workaround..
^
http://e-wot.com/2010/01/the-cake-recipe-portal/
/me stands up
/me facehoofs
we havent namesd our group yet!!!
Hey
How about
I named it!
Let's call it
HMC!
THE PIN TWINS?
cleaverbot has adhd
wait
Ham Maned Crusaders!
13but they are a recent version of PHP that supports DateTime::add(), GD, and write access to the backlog file (and maybe directory for posters)
:3
I say we should go ahead and plan a BN meeting after we launched BS 2.0
lol
ha!
08,01shizu: either that or i could host BS2.0 on one of my servers until we make a decision about BN infrastructure
1,3that kid is not gonna last -.-
ok that is correct
If you're rainbow dash, you are the best pony
ok how old am i?
1,3nah, he left on purpose, he's been jumping rooms
Yeah! :D
Rarity said in the previous episode
29
"When I get back you're gonna get it rainbow dash..."
oh yeah
and then hospital
*rainbow dash ended up in the hospital next episode*
no
RD crashed
:D
1,3or some kid on a sugar high
\_o3o_/
that's all
Hmm. :/
08,01Luna: aye, but i think we should work on the assumption that whatever direction we take it in, we'll need at least a bit of capital behind us.
lol
:( I'm missing the puppy bowl
13datetime i might be able to work around, maybe, and GD might not be necessary but i'll get to that
Puppy bowl eh?
Twilight!
08,01to be honest, i'd rather not host it, as i don't actually have any i'd consider production environments
Tolver: its still on
How did you get here?!
conspiracy?
and no "curses" either
I have no idea, rainbow.
We'll be discussing funding when we discuss BN properly though
besides
I'm scared.
we HEARD her
Hold me Twiligt.
08,01aye
Whats wrong?
Of course
These...other ponies...
had to be sure
(*.*)>[/] caprisun
Wow.
cleverbot is "derpy"
Seriously?
08,01though i have a server that i'd consider reliable enough to host bs2.0 for a few months
Yes...
Okay then.
Well
*squee*
/me sits back and drinks cider
08,01okay, let's move on with bs2.0
08,01i was going to talk about a streaming server
lol
08,01but honestly, with BN coming up, i don't really see th epoint anymore
Rainbow Dash: *squee*
*Pinkie pie dumps the cider*
08,01oh, wait, iw as gonna talk about that too
Pinkie pie: Umad?
:3
13mips causes grumbles now and then, but everyone knows to get adblock to solve it
08,01oh, shit, i meant to do some benchmarking this week
Ffffffffffuuuuuu-
PINKIE PIE!
(why I oughta...)
08,01okay, next week, i want to do some benchmarking of stream embeds
/me whispers to rainbow dash
08,01because we're getting very varying performance on some
"kill her."
>_>
CleverBot's speaking in tongues!
/me whispers back
eyeah
"are you serious?"
08,01so i'll make a survey and get viewers to fill it out
oh no
not here
"It's not like you can make me kill her, anyway."
seriously
Please don't go there
Sprachentze Deustch?
Silence?
do not
1,3so yeah, www.bronystate.net/rules
08,01on stream laggyness, geographic location, etc.
1,3read them
#_____
1,3lol
yeah, it's a rule
13drop the subject
it causes too much drama
#PonyRP ?
13as long as it's not one of ours
08,01aye, but even that's useful
Generally the streams are fine for me.
we could.. add it to the lotto survey
for once
1,3can't just let me work on my picture can you >.<
Hmhmm.
hm
no stream?
08,01so i can make inferences about why it's like that
awkward turn of events made things awkward
awkward silence that is.
akward!
LETS BATTLE!
RAINBOW DASH, I CHOOSE YOU!
hello again, i'm distracted from my distractions thismorning
/me explodes right before the battle
/me sumons snorlax
owwww
Oh sh-
#PonyRP
08,01there are some streaming services that are consitently bad that i think we shoudl drop, or some we should use more than others
08,01or for specific purposes
f
j-just battle....
x.x
Oh...
Umm...
Language tag.
...
guys
RP
/me is going brb now.
you go
hey]
do that dere
have fun
1,3Please do not advertise other channels
08,01anyhoos, i'll get that organised tonight or tomorrow afternoon
08,01moving swiftly on to my last item...
04Dari would know more about that, probably
/me yawns and does homework
Hey guys! I found a cool channel called #awesomechannel !
O_O
bah, homework
and hey Acorn :D
It doesn't even exsist!
hey hated
That's how awesome it is!@
13not even sure how much it's being worked on, haven't seen him check in the site revamp group in a while
/me is back
Totally.
hello?
04In any case, he's in the tech room and I'd assume that he had been making some kind of progress.
08,01okay, how much of a "thing" is it right now? do we still need it, do we still want him on it, do we want one of us to implement something instead?
dem giants.
No, we shall stream the um...
football i think
Maybe the....
:D?
I just want to see it for the commercials.
04In regards to that, his position was strictly temporary and once BS 2.0 was finished he was to leave
lol
^
50 bucks on the patriots
crap, I blundered the joke.
08,01okay, because all he seems to do is just hang around the bs2.0 skype group
04And it's up to the tech team. If you think he's not doing much work, but his work could be salvageable then finish it.
i typed *dies* it said *smiles*
National Football League
04We could probably talk to him about it after this meeting is over and see where he stands
10,02Ohai everypony ^_^
Patriots are gonna win either way
08,01aye
..........
I'm gonna go now.
hello!!
1,3hey
Bye everypony!
GIANTS all the way
. . . . . . .
?....
multiple dots
yeah
1,3welcome :)
/me takes one "Cheers TopHat"
08,01to be honest, i have no idea. i did know before, but i can't remember
well i just decided to replay one of my games
which one
Cheers :)
rules enforcement.. I believe was part of it
13that i know of, DumbFabric's spec was to watch for colors, kick for spam, and synchronize bans across the mane six channels
Giants? Ha you ponies are hilarious.
ratchet and clank future:tools of destruction
08,01but... daribot pretty much does that
/me drinks cocacola instead
how are you?
yea then there's no real use
huh, turns out i cant see the superbowl streams from australia. how unfortunate :P
For once, we'll have a boring Superbowl.
/me drinks caprisun *underage*
10,02Eugggh...ponies?
lol
:3
tastes about right
08,01i.e., voice and above aren't enforced
1,3:)
need to shower. hopefully it's actually 10 minutes today
08,01for colour kicking and rate limiting
I'm Canadian. It's Canadian beer
It ignores by name and rank, maybe I didn't add voice to the ignor
ignore*
08,01ah, okay
Give me a sec, I'll check it.
my clock is next to the computer just quietly ticking away
i typed *pulls out gun* it said *pulls out god*
that would drive me crazy
08,01does it also ignore for rate limiting, or just for colours?
tick.tick.tick....ikr
I'll take a lok
look&
traffic lights*
Hmm
1,3well, good news is there seems to be a lot of groups popping up all over the place
08,01oh, bugger, yes, that was something i wanted to discuss too
^
animal planet
Oh... right... this was going...
13what were the lights supposed to be for?
Same
hey y rn u doin HW
i'm too hightech and lazy for normal clocks
it's not on till 4 overhere
Well originally.
XLVI = 46?
The IRC script would set channels to invite only when one had too many more than the others.
I'm doing it but it's on either way
For the main 6 channels.
>_>
still talkin on here
loololol
yea, yesterday
got to go bye
>.>
I liked it..
it was nice to balance the rooms
1,3going to have a meetup at the comic/anime convention here in 2 weeks, should be a good time
i loool alot
13ahhh
/me goes to do homework
Or yellow, if it were nearly at the limit.
this time forealzies
The problem was
When we had a pony ep
alright guys
alright i am
I'm out for now
see you all later
good... good...
It was the easiest way I could update the XML file from IRC
bye!!
bye
kool
go patriots!!
;ater ota... oh poo to slow
ahd typod
13^^^^^
08,01aye
Already do
No use having 2-4 different bots
reading is for eggheads? but i like to read :)
Since I'm in all the channels
And
The scripts run in all the channels
13rather than scripts out of dari's client
i mean :(
1,3lol, that's how it's been for a lot of people
its was like Hook line and Stinker
It needs to be able to be configured over DCC
Eggdrop style
still i think to many people think worng about us
Ie. disable certain commands, set limits, etc
08,01aye
I just set that up for commands in the mod channel
1,3it's unfortunate, but not all that unexpected
But no one ever used the commands anyway. :P
13we also don't know about them...
well there is a group that wants to hate something just to hate on those people
where is everypony
Well, the scripts were written a while back
Frankly, I didn't even know we had a VCS in place
I told the mods back then
None of them ever used them.
Nor was I aware of using pogoplug
13from a recently-a-viewer perspective, daribot is only there to watch and kick for colors, and to beat you for 6 messages in 10 seconds, that's all anyone ever sees of daribot
04I was under the impression that the lights don't work, and unless we can get them properly up and running then I say we should scrap it
Can't we use channel flags for limiting flood?
The lights used to work
But I turned them off
you found my cave?
13yes dift
Like I said I liked the lights
I asked the IRCops a while ago
13you can, let me grab docs
And they pretty much told me no
Well, the IRCd on Canternet supports exceptions
outa ma cave!
Because I asked if they had something like +f on unrealIRCd
Like allowing ops to use colors
And they didn't
13https://bitbucket.org/uranium/shadowircd/raw/ef3b9dff52cb/help/opers/cmode unless they've modified the IRCd, you can
But I'm hiding from zombies!
It's just turned off
08,01prince-dari: but the buttons are buggy, and it doesn't work for high volumes of traffic
04Why was it turned off originally?
NNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRDDDD
thank u:)
And the easiest way for it to write to the file was if I hosted it locally for the traffic lights to get it.
/me facehoofs
Unless you got a gigabit line
I don't recommend doing it
Heheh, that's why I turned it off.
Hallo
1,3hehe :)
i loved the songs they use in season 2
08,01so what's the verdict? scrap or keep? because if we keep it, i say we rewrite it.
Hi....
brains are 20% tastier...
Have a cron run every 5 minutes to scrape channel usage and update the load on the website
13unreal's a straight flood protection isn't it?
You have to remember, this is shadowIRCd
Yeah.
13yeah that... not going to work here... just look at the derpy reactions
yo
13oooooor
Whats up
1,3I like Becoming Popular more, but I do like both
13assume not, not at least for initial BS2.0 deployment
If needed I can edit the traffic lights though, I still have the flas around somewhere
13^
You have to remember
lol
We're talking about possibly 4-5k people here
lol
08,01aye, couple of thousand people, got it
13yeah we're having a lot of conflicting ideas here...
It was just because I couldn't host the file
13^ rather than update file, poke a script serverside that updates, same functionality, less load
cherrychanga
08,01aye
Serve content
08,01post to a server side script
13not post, just get, add a key to the end
08,01changing values, use post
oh just some boxed console displays
13you're just sending "i locked this channel"
1,3Florida, USA
okay cool
hows the weather there?
during pony eps... it's hard to moderate it
1,3definitely not winter lol
That's the problem with mane
It just won't work during pony eps
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumquat
Not too bad
Too many people on it
08,01um... i have a daft suggestion
1,3hasn't gone below 50 F more than 3 times this year >.<
did any of you ever have a dream where you had kinda meh superpowers ?
/me is listening
Either +q or +/-v
08,01maybe mute mane during pony episodes
^
We have 6 channels
08,01that way, people won't have a central place to be all talky in
yeah can say that agian its cold here in holland like -11 degrees at night
1,3brr :(
08,01and it'll effecively auto load balance based on the distribution of peoples pony choices
Well I'm gonna go watch the superbowl, see you ponies later.
13it'd be easier to spread us out over six channels with less people than six plus mane with everyone
And that got us a quite a lot of PR.
08,01prince-dari: would that be such a loss?
08,01oh, well, i guess
the vid was made in the pinkie room :)
not the main room
Oh.
08,01though we'd still get those reacionts, just more spread out over the 6 channels
Yeah, the idea was always to delay main, not mute entirely.
I once had a dream where I could fly, but only intermittently. Or were talking about powers more like Milk Man's?
what's the puppy bowl?
13you can't delay messages, even unreal's flood protection is per-user, and we need per-channel
Well we can
But if floods mode changes
08,01if you force people to use 6 equal biased rooms, they'll spread themselves out
it*
were puppies play football
08,01if you say "this one is the main one" they'll all use that
But for people using proper clients it's a bit annoying.
its something put on by animal planit and they put a bunch of puppies in a little thing that looks like an arena and they put a ball in there and they kind of play
just go watch it
13okay, reading modes for what's possible, here's my suggestion
eeee
touchdown!
a puppy doing a touchdown? Neat
13take the mane six rooms, put them in some random list, set +l <some limit> on them all, +f <channel> to the next in the list
Problem with that is we never know how many people we'll get.
they held the ball in their mouth and crossed into the inzone
And if we assume it'll be around 5k
We'll end up with one room really full of people first before any of the others get users
If I had telekinesis just strong enough to turn the steering wheel, I'd be in heaven.
13yes
BOOM!
1,3hmm
13but as more join, they get pushed along
BANG!
POW!
another touchdown :D
oh wait i tought that was at the HOME part right?
nice episode
the movie
08,01i think a combination of that plus +m for mane
08,01aye
#101
Well... we could have a round-robin to force people to the less loaded channels
1,3the front page shows the current newsletter, the movies get streamed through the same page as the episodes
1,3it does
Brain....
08,01i like shizuka's idea
giveme Brains!
cool
08,01especially of +i rather than +m
If they want to, say, join #RBD, let them
08,01once we reach, say, 500 in mane, we +i
Also, disable knocks on mane
If you set +i
08,01aye
Why would we +i main?
i really hope i can be here when it starts
Everyone is supposed to be in main.
That's the point of it
Well
It doesn't work
08,01prince-dari: to stop 5000 people talking at once in one channel
It's a fucking disaster zone
Not +io
+i*
/me eats Derpy brain anyway
08,01prince-dari: no, just stop people coming in once we reach 500
Again, that's pointless.
08,01and let them filter to the other 6 channels
/me eats everyone's brain
+m makes more sense
More brains...
Everyone is supposed to be in main
13dari you're not listening
Otherwise it isn't main
hmmm you know the HUB has alot of commercials 6_9 thats kinda irritating
/me is now brain less.................
you're a no-brainer
i lost my brain yesterday
:D
/me needs brain back
08,01prince-dari: i think we have to draw the line somewhere for that; 5000 in a channel is not conducive to anything, and doing +m is pointless, as it means they can't use it
does no one remember
Main would then become just another one of the main6 channels.
my brain blew up :(
13it's still main during the week
so...how bout that Puppy Bowl?
08,01^
yep
+m makes more sense than +i, there's no point in it being the main channel if you're going to +i it.
13please everyone keep in mind we're talking about a half hour span of time, maybe more before
08,01this is just for pony episodes
whats this feeling ....h=gaaaaa guuuuuuuh waaaaaaaaaaa yaaaaaaaaaaaaa
it's not on till 3
13that too
mine is full of f*** , you dont want to eat that
08,01prince-dari: but there's no point there being the channel at all if it's -n
08,01*+m
I'll have to agree with dari, here...but that's just me
Mane would remain mane for the week, and during pony eps, mane would be restricted, leaving the satellite channels to have the load spreaded
where are you?
^
hahaaa
East Coast
1,3the station is largely ad-driven, can't avoid it :(
08,01exactly
13^
uhuh
Hello everypony!
Since I don't know about you, but the mane is unreadable during a pony ep
And it sucks
Considering most of the talking happens in main, we'd probably end up with 6 unmoderateable channels instead of 1.
whats up with those bowls ? and whats in them ? potatoe salad ?
08,01rather than no-one getting to talk
13can't throttle messages
We can
04You could switch off, actually
As of now, they'll be a lot less conversation, and a lot more killing.
hello
08,01Ghosties: no mane 6 during the week, but no mane during the pony episode?
dari-o had a plan for that if I'm not mistaken
Guys, I'm having tacos for supper
didn't even bother to lurk
Not if 5000/6 means 6 unmanageable compared to 5000/1 1 unmanageable.
haha
why is there no stream
ikr
13you're still not listening..
04I say this because it seems like there's a lot of leaks and cracks that trolls and other neerdowells can enter from with the mane6
ok
13there would not be 5000 in each of the mane six
I just don't agree.
hehe
Yes it willl!
13there would be significantly less than that in each of the mane six, adding up to 5000
08,01to be fair 5000/6 is still a lot of people
^ exactly.
Suuuuuuure
BRAAAAAAAAAAAINS:[
are you the nicer version?
11,01As am I.
And I'm saying 5000/6 is 6 unmanageable numbers.
Saturn: it's less than having 5k on one channel
deal with it
Nu uh.
I am.
orly?
08,015000 is unworkable, 1000 * 6 just requires more people
i am!!
13which we have
08,01exactly
I am!
11,01Now, now. I always welcome a little company.
He's the faker.
And I think 800 people is beyond that limit.
08,01but i don't think ~1000 is that point
/me curls up in ball in corner and naps
13why are you out of uniform
Because I ate my uniform.
/me 11,01jumps on top of Discord's head.
That's why.
:D
08,01not too fast to be unmoddable
1,3>.>
Get off my head, faker.
*snore*
/me noms fillys brine while napping
08,01and we have the manpower now to scale mods horizontally across the channels
13ident you silly filly~
*brain
**squee
08,01instead of vertically in one clusterfuck of 5000 people
^
/me dreams of meeting the mane6
04^
Okay!
Hey.
04Yes
yeah?
04We need to get that situated
13DarthNigger: please choose a more respectful nick
04We had that idea originally, but it kind of fell to pieces
yep
Anyway, +m the main room, I'm fine with, but not +i.
+m it is then
DERPY TALKED
Well, mod.
lol Ishaq
da fuq are you talking about?
13good boy..
1,3<3
we just need to INFORM our viewers
Well...
member.
I think he's looking for me
Whatever.
Sure
Haha no its fine
Anyone, everyone hates you.
there is one thing we're not considering right there
I'm not a mod either ^_^
Look, everyone doesn't care about you.
13dusky is an ircop
13he sort of outranks everyone
did i say she?
stalking you mean
crop
yes u said she and her
dillop
/me 11,01steps on Discord's head. Lovelly view.
XD
/me 11,01hops.
08,01yeah, good idea
11,01Now now, no need to ruin a fellow draconnequus' fun.
And yes, I did say waffle.
No idea.
Chanserv has disappeared.
*you
:/ yea...
I'm the real one.
/me 11,01explodes
See?
04Because I thought about that too
08,01to be honest, i think this is more an executive decision that needs to be made based on how well we can mod the channels
I don't explode.
11,01He's right. I'm too chaotic!
though I do agree with Mane 6 Weekday lockdown
not particularly stalking, not really
he knows about this net
Yeah, channel has unregistered for some reason, it seems.
XD
yeah i guess his logic is sound :/
04We don't need to piss them off
NS!
/me explodes because he is too dictracted to stop it
Lawl
it should be win/win :)
Then I give them to whatever, and ponies eat ponies.
That's why.
11,01Oh, that never works.
08,01though, i can't see many people thinking this is a bad idea
Of course they do.
04As mentioned, I suggest we try this idea for a week and see how it goes
08,01any step is a step up
where is Pinkie when you need her
Well then;
08,01aye
sure, works for me
down*
You cant get on my bad side ,because i only have good sides . You can get on my bedside however!
The channel's just unregistered for some reason. O_o
but we have to inform them via the newsletter or in another way?
I'll give them to Rainbow Dash, and she'll do it.
(In the rainbow factory)
08,01Ghosties: i still think it should be +i rather than +m
Is it just some reregister issue?
But anyway,
Wow, that logic
Mai gawd
That's something you have to keep in mind
Oh please, that only works on Luna.
13they're called #brony >>
04^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
04THAT
04We do NOT want shit to escalate with them
13sorry did i say that out loud .-.
04I'm telling you
04We need diplomacy and tact
08,01shizu <3
okay, next point? :)
XD
08,01well, that's all i had
13well... they're also outside our jurisdiction, we can't go through every decision trying not to rile them up, cause they'll do that on their own
04Shizu?
/me does'nt want another 8.5hrs meeting..
I have one point.
this was made in the 1st century by ME.
04And that's ture
13if they start escalating, we must call in opers, that's all there is to it
04Oh, Luna?
I presume you also invented bread?
I was wondering.. which requirement does the BS server need?
No idea
I invented you, little one.
mufffin!!!!
it's a bitch on icechat
13not too terribly much i would think... saturn?
512... lal.. that's no problem
I have to apply it each time, and I cba to learn how to do the script for it
or even if icechat supports that kind of thing
08,01well, if he's offering >.>

I REALLY feel like playing Kingdom Hearts 2

But not the Nittanity one.
The other one.
Hmm
I'm him.
He's me.
11,01We are alike with all but personality and looks.
It's as simple as can be.
-_-
You know you can manually enter network addresses into mibbit to join them? :P
I think he came first dude
/me predates Celestia

11,01Hi.
http://www.speedtest.net/result/1754340541.png
13we pay for 12/4, we get more down and less up though...
I have some terrible news.
Very terrible.
Do you want to hear this terrible news?
No
Okay, here it goes;
NOOO!!!!
08,012 secs
the end.
OH SHI--
http://www.speedtest.net/result/1754342043.png
and that ends today's News report.
oh wow..
Fuuuuu

it was a real stinker too
(u mad, Nittany Discord)
TeliaSonera Finland, Fiberoptic to CAT-6 outlet, 100/10 line
he aint even mad
we may need to renew our router at some point
Hi everypony!
XDDDDDD
08,01um, guys, i just remembered something
Awkward
08,01i have a server at uni
20€ a month for that
wait...
wow, just wow.:|
@pony
cheap dift!
13we don't get anywhere close to 24 down
Lozzle cakes
oh wait, another news report comes in!
08,01or rather, the computing society (that i'm president of) does
Here it goes;
shh
Luna: Cheapest Interwebs in Finland
11,01How am I mad? I am busy, though.
@pony
the end.
Saturn: You got access to a 100/100 or a gigabit line there?
that's all it said.
08,01we have a 1gbit line all to ourselves
Dedicated?
i-jelly
:P
08,01it's a dual opteron
08,012gb ram, i think
Yup
08,01only problem is it's currently sitting in a cupboard, rather than a rack, but i can get it set up in a few weeks
08,01or less
http://www.ovh.co.uk/dedicated_servers/
wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle YEAH!
08,01basically, i need to go through a load of paperwork to use the compsci facilities
Those are few dedicated servers for comparison
but yea what's it gonna be?
we're going OTR
off topic -r
13^
*chirp chirp*
Yes.
No
11,01*shrug*
Hey!
The more power we have, the less we have to worry about the server coughing blood when shit goes down
Straw!
girl look at that body, girl look at that body,girl look at that body, i work out!
/me noms the cricket
11,01I'm not running.
08,01aye, i think if luna's dad's gonna get a server anyway, that'd be a good place to host
08,01the connection seems fine for us
awesome
Regarding BS 2.0 then.
and school
Did anyone else have anything to say?
Hai
13my topics are 50% content
13http://pastebin.com/BdpACpgY
You just did
http://th08.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2012/032/1/e/trustfall__by_amidnightflight-d4obp71.png
11,01Sure.
This sentence is false!
Pinkie representing users and Rarity the server
11,01OK.
Rules aren't really something fora tech meeting, yeah.
i'll schedule another R&R meeting
13but it's content
OK, that was easy.
13my main point is that if we're keeping the dropdowns everywhere, then rules *must* have a clear header line, then details
/me is nomd
No!
There is no answer!
11,01OK.
Umm, False
I'm a bit opposed to the dropdown
Well we could always just do the rules without dropdown
Instead, have a ToC
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/8e0f7c6781ceeee7f01d30d33341ca2f/2917%20-%20handsome_superman%20meme%20photoshop%20twilight_sparkle.jpg
Easy.
Both have no answer.
With clickable links that point to the appropriate part in the page
Ain't that the truth..
when i walk on by, girls be looking like "damnhe fly"
That song...
^
:'(
It hurts my ears
For rules I don't think dropdowns are good. They have to click to open every single part of the rules, and most members can't be bothered to start with.
13^ this is why i say they *must* have a clear header
/me snaps
Aha!
I know!
Content of the rules isn't really something for discussion here.
08,01then click for clarification
How we display them is, but content of them, no.
hey!
13again, the point is we can still have details, but the headers absolutely must be clear
Yo!
11,01Yes?
It's terrible.
13such that they could be the whole rules page on their own if they had to be
Not sad.
11,01Everyone's here. Let's have fun.
I think dropdowns are a really bad idea for rules to be honest.
13it was specced in dift's list of 'things to fix' when i was brought on, just following issues
11,01It's all part of the fun.
I give up
:D
Yaaaaaaaay!
pfft
When I'm Chaotic
/me drop it!
/me 11,01dances
The user shouldn't have to 'do' anything to be able to receive the rules.
That is a VERY bad idea.
11,01Ohh, yeah.
13but if they want more information they can get it
08,01prince-dari: but it's not receiving the rules, it's clarifying them
13the rules are as much a resource for us as them too
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qwRbOm2Pvg&feature=related
/me hits the stero
It is if they don't get a clear idea from just the header.
I hate that song.
13then. make. the. header. clear.
And however clear the header is to you, it most likely won't be to other people.
Let's listen to this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R677MV--WI
Sometimes more clarification than just a couple of words is needed.
08,01"no gore, no porn, no colours, don't be a dick" <-- pretty clear
To you maybe.
I say...
When i'm Magic
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJP11_BkU8Q
Should listen to - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVBcm_BZRs&feature=fvwrel
/me has a sad
My little metal!
"5DON'T BE A COMPLETE, PEDANTIC DICKWEED AND/OR ASSHAT"
Considering most users don't even read the rules, thinking they'll want to clarify these headers is laughable.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajxyWHz3VtA&feature=related
/me mmm, yeah!
They should receive the full rules without having to work for it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R677MV--WI&feature=related
13which brings me to a point brought up at last week's meeting and not on my list
/me has 2 happies and a sad
Oh right...
because TL; DR
Therefore more likely to be read.
Qweb IRC can be hacked to have customized emoticons
08,01prince-dari: have you ever been to the creative commons website?
I know I wouldn't read it
I support Dr. Fluttershy
08,01example: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/
i loved that song of DR house
The rules there are outlined exactly as I say.
1,3?
08,01vs: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/legalcode
Saturn: The first set it exactly how I am saying they should be
Not how you are
/me snaps
You are saying they should have to work to receive the explanations
Because I did it.
Dooooooi.
Where as on the first link you posted, the explanations are just there in plain text.
08,01prince-dari: that page has less text than our rules page
For all to see.
08,01waaay less text
08,01okay, maybe not waaay
We aren't discussing the content of the rules now.
08,01but less.
I've said that already.
08,01no, we're disscusing UE
1,3eh, it happens sometimes
But...
13no, we're arguing UE
13and wasting time
Next topic!
If we are not discussing the content of the rules, why are you talking about the amount of texT?
Leave this for latter
13DARI
my reaction to latest ep: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-the-newest-episode.png
13thank you
Hiii yah!
13About Us and History pages on my site, is the copy good as is?
Why leave it for later?
hello!!
We haven't come to a decision?
oh great.
That is the point of the meeting
To make decisions.
Because we're wasting time on a single bucking thing
08,01okay, all in favour of dropdowns say aye
watch. next thing you know, it'll be 2 hour-long 10 minute showers in one day.
I know!
08,01aye.
1,3if there's nothing else going on, yeah
there!
^
08,01fair enough
And a minute to me is a second or two. ;)
Fine.
13i have been trying to get feedback on content for weeks
and the temple of Doom!
DOOM!
13About Us and History pages, is the content good and up to date as is?
13considering it is apparently from many months ago now
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&list=PL837883F65F45179A&v=i4Ykf4R8lLM
screw it i changed it back
DOOOOOOM!!!!

You have to click each dropdown to open them separately.
Good night everypony
Do it or die.
lol horse
its not night
Take a look on the site
10,02Night*
No!
08,01i need to abscond for about 15 minutes
He shall be corrupted.

Hello guise

No seriously.

10,02My tail O__o
You are corrupted.

/me nomms on kirz|art's pic accidentally eating it
you're*
contact us is not up to date
04Will there still be a history page?
13http://du.cx/shizuka/?page_id=6 history page
04Good
13i believe the decision from last week was to move former mod information to History
well you can't slay trolls without one. Any other intrument only serves to temporarilly disolve them.
1,3sketch, scan, then touch it up digitally, add color, etc
>Touch it up digitally.
Mental image engaged.
04I recall leaving former mods out, but I could be wrong
hey mr/mrs/ms mod.....
why is there no stream?
13former mods won't be on the main mods page anymore, but we could remove altogether
Lawl
:P
13i think that was still up in the air, whether to remove former mods altogether or move to History page
toys, not spoilers
1,3nobody's available to stream anything
cadence'
1,3the usual reason why there wouldn't be a stream ;)
i didnt know that lol
i thought it was borked:P
I say move them
why dont YOU stream?
1,3plus with the superbowl I think most of the other streamers are busy
1,3I don't have the connection to support it unfortunately
football is boring...i like watching chess :D
http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyw7p1wFap1r1b6b6o1_400.gif
1,3lol
I see twilight knows how cod players play
I'm not busy (don't need football), but don't know how to stream
1,3yeah, I don't follow football, I'm just working on a picture right now
13all in favor of moving former mods to history page
and soccer too!
13aye
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAALLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
aye
/me shrugs "aye"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkj9uTEnz64
and have access to the interwebz
Fine.
lets make poetry on how the stream is still loading, 4th.
11am to 11pm
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Xx62U0GW9ew
like actually
1,3lol
hi
thats REALLY illegal
pirating is one thing
1,3pretty sure they run their own stream you have to pay for
Yeah, we shouldn't steep down to their level
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-so-thats-what-she-does.png
...they have a Parrot at the Puppy Bowl using twitter.
forget the actual superbowl, stream the commercials.
puppy bowl's on!!
Commercials would cause legal issues too
04History really needs to be updated
13job for the lit department?
we need to add something bout live eps yeah
definently
well kirz....as an offer
i can stream on sundays if yall want
oh D:
just an offer
04Luna is known as Sathi in the history
1,3lol
04Yeah, it needs to be really updated
ends say, 2pm est, relatives call to cali, cali residents bank off it
04I could probably get something to Val and see if he wants to rewrite the history for us
1,3only certain mods and techies get to stream, there's a level of trust there for accessing the site's accounts
sure
Half OPs were streaming yesterday...
technically :p
i really think they need some kind of schedule for streaming
13should they update About Us too?
like "person on on Mon and Tue" etc
one on*
1,3it's been tried, having a set schedule locks down that person during those times, and if something comes up it causes issues
ok
puppies!!!
was just an ide
idea
is it a sad goal to be a mod somewhere?
sucks
wtf did i put "like
Yes and no, i think
"
Puppy Bowl
XD
i have my own forum
that thing is adorable
XD
but
Pony Bowl
there is NEVER anyone on it
i am srs... sucks, prefer baseball
1,3if it's something you like, go for it, but it's usually a lot of work
PUPPIES!!!!
i dont mind work
10,02i liek puppies :3
10,02With that said, brb.
1,3if/when we do need more mods, the announcement usually goes out in the weekly newsletter
i kinda like madona.a
are there certain criteria necessary?
If a drunk man from england is in america and says he loves to not hate soccer witch sport is he talking about?
http://snfallaccess.nbcsports.com/ SuperBowl livestream
GIANTS
*about
no!
:D
1,3:p
they should have fluttershy.
pinkie pie
1,3if you stick around, by the time we're looking again you won't be a noob ;)
13are we sticking with the Location/Favorite Pony/Favorite Movie/Duties layout, want to add anything, and is it up to date for all the current mods?
both
Derpy
I don't like adverts.
13and shall i continue with the ornaments or shall we switch back to avatars
everypony
:O
one site i tried for wanted a 500 word essay as a mod app
and i still have it
Ornaments look good to me.
Quality over quantity my friend
ornaments is a grand idwa. I want to modi
*modify mine though : 3
yeah like sometimes they show trailers for movies that are gonna be out.
13http://s13.zetaboards.com/BronyState/topic/6880917/ i also have a thread up asking the newbies for details
08,01i'm back

Tor a search engine that makes u untrackable by any one

FootBall http://duckbar.mirror.waffleimages.com/files/bf/bfd31b86b449057acb49467be3deed3e23aff762.png
Anyway, moving on.
What's next?
13(same for current mods, maybe a mention of which department you're in?)
The duties sections aren't very accurate anyway, haven't updated them for a long time
^^^
makes sense.
13which is why it's on my list
08,01crap, must abscond again; i'll catch up when i'm back
1,3best thing you can do is just have fun :)
SHED
/me noms with agreement ^_^
1,3me, I'm the silly one :)
Did you say... Silly?
As in...
/me nomnomnomnomnom
:3
i like silly fillies
:O
1,3Glomp PILE!
they are cute
and awesome
/me hops on glomp pile
:D
specifically, three silly fillies.
13so if i could get a canon list of duties for everyone, maybe add a line for department (department leads?) would be great
ohyes.
of course, he wins
