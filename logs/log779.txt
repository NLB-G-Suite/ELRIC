Obsolete: I don't know, that third one voided any chance of it winning "best series" awards.
04Suuuuuuuure, Obsoolet
it's true that the us (and other countries) fight too much for oil, but terrorists should never achieve anything with how they work...
This scene may have gay undertones. I don't know.
Ghosties: Mass Effect is a rare form of game known as ART.
Dump the fuel!
DON'T CROSS THE STREAMS'
Don't cross the streams
04*Obsolete
The president from metal wolf chaos was still better

Far cry is good too.
Batteries dead

final fantasy 4=art
LOW BAT
fcking bat
SOTC is art, not MAss Effect.
plane can dodge missiles on auto pilot but doesn't have redundant wiring
If you cut em all, youre guaranteed to get the right one
Quick cross it with the milk!
oh what a convinient moment to lose signal...
Mass Effect is a mass defect in making a good game series.
its always RED!
Must be using an iPhone battery
Fine time for a dead phone.
Speaking of far cry, I'm playing far cry 3 after this shit is over.
CHOOSE
Pretty shitty batteries.
DON'T CROSS THE STREAMS
1 out of 4 ..good luck
Don't cross the streams
OohShiny Ys would like to have a word with you

Ghosties: please meme arrows more
MGS was a reallu fucking strange game series
Seriously?

that Low Battery Dx (happens whenver I'm making an important call too xDD )
GREEN LCD of Death!
he wont cut murica wires
Bomb defuse / Presedents wins
GREEN AND YELLOW
Dr_Fumbles: Yeah the Mass Effect games are good. The third was pretty crap though, and not just dat ending.
Doing it on a hunch...
HOLYYYY
THESE COLORS DONT CROSS

RED WHITE AND BLUE NEVER FAILS!!!

MURICA levels are rising! 4500%! Take that terrorist SCUM!

04But MGS is still a unique experience
Bloody hell am I immature -_-

Plane is taking a dump :D
Yay! I just got word I don't have to work tommorow! I can watch the episode with everybody else! YAY!
^
and the fuel lands on someones campfire
CORNO?
Gun is best copilot
757s can stay in the air for 7 hours after all engins have stoped
Unique does not equate 'art'
AJIsAwesome: what did he say?
:$
04Nice, Rookeealding

AJIsAwesome: wut?
All I can say is
Yeah but none of those countries count, they are the jobbers of the world.
Don't say that, MakerDusk. :P
stormtrooper accuracy :I
Anytime someone says MGS was serious, I point out Fatman.
Dat Spray and pray!
i have a death fetish :P
'It's an experience.'
Hopefully this time there are no spoil sports ! they ruined it last time!
REAL RUSSIANS USE AK74 INSTEAD OF MP5K
Gonna do a light jog here
That gun would be out of bullets by now
LOL
AJIsAwesome: he's jinxed now XD
04Point out Fatman and I point out Running Man
Laugh and grow fat!
VenHur: Salutes you right back
Obsolete or Psycho Mantis?
so, by the time BMN ends, I'll drink my 17th cup of coffee
guys quick question
Fun fact: A clip that size would only last 3-5 seconds of sustained fire before being depleted
He fell for that
Ashles: at least is better than my aimming :D
04The series has moments of dumb things
Bottomless Magazines, anybody?
anyone here has BF3?
MakerDusk: All thanks to you. XD
'MURICA

no
thelonepony: aww :'3
AJIsAwesome: I'm evil, duh XD
O COME ON
04But at its core it's still a serious, intelligent series...albeit being quirky and confusing
pony_9229: ak47 might not be the best choice for a plane fight
Top Gun
MakerDusk: EVIL?!
Maybe.
It is that. MGS is amazing.
lol
EEEEEEEVIIIILLL!!!!

Top Gun
Ded.
MGS3 was also fucking depressing!
She's not very good at this negotiating thing.
so this is a problem for the good guys how?
just let it crash, make it easy for everyone
This is physics: Without lift, the plane crashes
They didn't try hijacking the Russians, because they'd just shoot the plan out of the air.
so who's he gonna kill after 50 minutes?
Where's Ivan where you need him?
Inb4 They pulled a Super Mario Bros. 2
....at that point I'd say fuck you and shoot the plane down
SNAAAAKE EAATAAAAAAAAAAA

00,10explosive bolts Phase4
^
they do this shit all the time
Phase4: And for a good reason xD
^^^^^
Airport 1975!
Phase4 - which does a heck of a lot of good at pressure
that guy has balls of titamium to do that
Totally legitimate idea.
seems legit
That must be real scary.
that's how the movie should end
I want to do that
look! Snake gonna save them! :D
The door seemed to explode out, they used some emergency mircoexplosvies to break it out or something
'Mazing
Thunderlane343: they'd probably get more viewer in their 20s-30s XD
and he through it on the ground
look so fake :d
o, HAI
Ohh Mai

This isn't entirely insane, at all.

I thought Dr. Jones didn't know how to fly a plane.
Bug on a windshield
airforce 1 this is redleader do you copy
So who's ready for The Ultimste Showdown (of Ultimate Destiny) *aka tommorrow's show*?
00,10is it bad i picture the bit from galexy quest as the guy slide down the body?
Nice Green Screen!
cachi01|ProjDIVA: wrong force. well said.
Phase4: pressure*
Whos plan was this again?
PULL ME IN! PULL ME--*fail*

PUSH HIM OUT!
Someone's gonna fall out.
MakerDust and they would have better quotes too
Wow, an hour 49 minutes and this movie's still going?
"Fly, yes. Land no."
Why didn't this guy just bring over some extra parachutes?!
SPY
My tit are cold
Push him out the plane!
*Snake* "Major,I've reached the plane of the president..." :D
04Sooooooo Gibbs

OK yep a one cab can hold all that
If they are not kid movies
Uh-oh

Everyone's calling him Gibbs... I'm still calling him Percy. XD
WEEE
05,15DaringDerpy I don't think we started late
Couldn't they just brought more parachutes??
The Engines are failing perfectly
hey r-dash

That looks liek so much fun
lali0-hgo r-dash
hi r-dash
:S
yay
For the love of Mother Russia?
Hello r-dash
Derpy's ideas are always great!
The moment you go into the kitchen and realize there was never any popcorn.
They could have throwed parachutes :"
DERPDERPDERPDERP: YES IT IS SHUT UP
yay
sending the first man with 5 parachutes?No i guess,too easy
DSNesmith: Because he's an evil communist.
he's still alive
fluttercry: the movie is that long? ok
dem PJs
hey Suinide
yay
watch someone fall out of the plane
He's the president... They could always just make another Air Force 1.
lol i thought he just dropped him off the plane
that would be fun zip lining over the 3rd world
Wheeee!
Woman and Children first!
Did he Just say BJ?
XD
Instead of sending men they should send parachutes
...wat
yay
DSNesmith: right? he can perfectly save himself and blame a ded
WAIT, did they ALL just forget about the traitor?
Hiya
00,10movie is 2h5min
I mean...
BJ Blazkowitz.
Goin Titanic on this plane!
Preparing to "recieve"

GET A YELLOW INFLATABLE LIFEBOAT AND JUMP OUTTA THERE!!!
And my Bible. Do not forget my Bible.

that would be so epic to do XD
well they'll trace the leak back to him eventually

WHEEEE
04So when does Gibbs turn?
how does she hear?
WEEEEEEEEEEE

it would be easier to just send some parachutes over
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
when is the spy gonna make his move?
"receiving position"? OHH MYY!!
and to think, we've got 4 pony episodes and an hour movie left
yay'
Hell with Harrison, security guy there has survived a bullet wound to the heart for several hours without even a bandage

This is really daring.
my next vaction ziplining from planes
Meh, try doing that 10 times.
I WOULD SCREAM WEEEEEEE WAAAA HOOOOO
They went DOWN.. and then back up the same line?
