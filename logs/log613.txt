11,01It stole my diary.
woot woot ^^
who going to stream now...
Nittany_Discord: it still can't explode AGAIN though.

Oh boy, gone for a weekend and lots of new videos to watch
Did you guys see the CMC Everfree panel? :D
No I hven't
MadSurge: yes
it was awesome
I don't keep track of those things anymore.
Not after...what happended.
MASF123: it can be hard to
Wish all girls were that funny :D
MASF123: and what did happen?
MASF123: I don't follow very much panels...
Phase4 what it doesnt list
is it will go after the dispenser if the sentry dies in the mean time

<.< Don't give me ideas atm, I need to focus on this coding
Phase4: can you please give me the link to that song

waddafaq?
Are wings still bugged?
fly u metal bird fly
Hmm...I keep getting a weird message in the stream.
00,02not sure what music to put on
...is that a fin propulsion bug again?
00,02Dark_Horst, yes and no
Dark_Horst: more like a wing hovering bug :D

It's going up! :D
yup it is
daft punk
00,02you'd think something with soo may control srufaces would be... controllable
FUCK PHYSICS
it's a pinkie pie ship
00,02Chrysalis, its up here
refresh now
it's up
yeah just came back up
00,02but yeah
00,02it will hover at about 8k forever
00,10not if you roll it
00,02true
00,02but dont do that and it flys forever
00,02plus its got tonns of fuel
00,02not controllable unfortunately
00,02Sumica, aparently its not working
00,10odd how it can float but as soon as you roll it on it's centerline it drops like well it shoud
00,02i'm climbing still
00,10no the roll controlls
00,02no, falling now
00,10q and e

that looks awesome
Dat Blue pony
crash you wont you wont do it you wont you wont
00,02the debris is still doing loop-de-loops
00,02should totally try use that instead of a parachute some time
00,02why not now
Phase4, what's with the rocket on your OC?
Phase4: go for it...danm you used a parachute
00,02MASF123, you ever played kerbal?
no...but I've seen in on the stream and Robbaz play it.
00,02seen rockets in the early design phase?
no...
00,02google it and suddenly it will make sense
00,02MASF123, i'll show one on stream
That screen your OC opens up? It's the chat?
MASF123 yup
no...Phase4
cause phase always tabs to the chat
Search up Robbaz
:/
Lol
that feel when a torrent is missing a peice...
and the trackers reporting seeds active but I see no eveidence
/me is up before the Celestia

this peice has been out of the swam for hours...
and killing kerbals
00,10nothing will beat tower of power
00,10and so many stageing failures
I once built a ring of soild fule boosters round my main rocket
Add moar rockets. :3 Is what Robbaz always says.
once I got it stable
and added a seconed ring stage on top of the soilds of jet fule and stoped it warping
11,01Going to try and sleep now.
it was WAY too powerful
night Nittany_Discord
see you
g'night Nittany_Discord
00,10his launc pad looks so diffrent
WOOOOOOOO
May lunas stars watch upon your sleep
you killed so much kerbels Phase4
,_,
the thrust to fule ratio and the stanges droping huge amounts of mass ment as soon as your other shell droped and if you survived that you rocketed out of attmo
Goodnight Nittany_Discord!
00,10I can see alot of this guys problem
/me is currenlt working on a rocket laucnhing space plane
00,10rcs on and full throdel
00,02wasnt my video
00,02i went through that stage though
00,02now i know how to build rockets
that was a youtube video.....

00,02struts almost break the game
How much RAM does your computer have Phase4?
00,02MASF123, 16 GB "{
00,02:P'
I on;y have 256MB....VERY LAGGY Lol
256 ram
godz above that's Jarassic these days
yeah 256MBs of RAM
would 4.00 gb ram be good to play garys mod and left four dead?
should be decent
plus it's like Â£40 for 4gb of DDR
3
00,02256 is really not enough for modern os'
00,02os's
MASF123 you need a new rig chummer
256 is tiny
no I mean 4 gbs
is decent
and my processor is Intel core i3-213m CPU 2.10GHz 2.10GHz
not mine.
00,02hmmm
00,02rocket might be a bit heavy
would that be able to play garys mod and left four dead
00,02no, nvm
00,02its all good
I have 6 gb of DDR3 in this, but my GPU is meh and my CPU in mid end
plus I'd really like more RAM
but this MB can only take 8GB tops
space space
where do you go to bye more ram
like at ofice depot or something'
a place that sells PC parts
more a tech shop
00,02hmmm
office depot then
What is CPU and GPU I always wondered.
Space core: i made it to space dad
or order online
they sell a lot of computer stuff there
MASF123 Central and Graphics processing units
I doubt an office depo will stock componets though
Yeahb but what do each do?
process
as a unit
...
Dumori: so online would be the best place then
Maybe
Can I upgrade them?
/me brohoofs Dumori
I don't know your nation or local area
MASF123 depends
are you on a mac
no Windows
then your fine, upgrade away
as long as the chip fits the MoBo
and the GPU doesnt overwhelm your PSU
And the bios likes it
And processors? What are those about?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor
Phase4: Space http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGo4eNFeIQo&list=UURZhlUwr0YARzVBTRoZGA_A&index=1&feature=plcp
woot woot ^^
I can't explain processors with out being insanely indepth of so vage it's useless
X3
cow334 no vid links in stream
Chrysalis: sorry
I balme my comp sci history there
Go for it, I just might pay attention if your lucky.
00,02cow334, after music
lol that bunnymustard
MASF123 basically the cpu does all the game stuff
the gpu draws it to the screen
ok
Phase4: okay
a CPU is the thing that dose all THE THINGS
most of the things
hmm...so the higher he number the better and faster is processeS?
no no
more or less ALL
things like physics are moving to the GPU now as well
is a Intel core 13 good
theres even some AI routines built for GPUs
or dedicated PPUs
LAWL
but the CPU still passes them along
no one uses those any more
Chrysalis yeah they do
PhysX was a nice idea
just not in a desktop for home use
Dumori you do realise they actually are just graphics cards right?
but without texture lookup stuff
depends on how you define them
etc
not quite
massivly parrallel computation chips
00,02rocket seems legit
So RAM is virtual memory...CPU handles all processes and GPU places it on the screen to watch. Sounds complicated.
MASF123 RAM is temporary memory
dude that's the simple and "wrong" version but yeah
Random Acess Memory
00,02'virtual memory' refers to something else
00,02ram is volatile
... :(
virtual memory is a file on the harddrive to trick the computer into thinking it has more ram
http://funnyjunk.com/funny_gifs/4026930/uhuahuahua/
00,02it requires the computer to be on to exist
00,02ksp is lagging my pc hard
00,02i think its going up
GPGPUs are the way forward though
plus you can just strap them together and make a PC
won't run any "real" OS
Wuut.
00,02somehow i havent exploded
but I have a mate who has a BANK of nivida cards for cyrpto work
General Purpose Graphics Processing units
basicly
Dumori nice
it's a GPU that can do other math
So your won't have any software like WIndows running but the computer will still run?
00,02operating systems generally depend on a 'mmu'
it also heats his flat
00,02gpu's dont have it due to performance reason
00,02plus the instruction sets on gpu's are tuned to the kind of work they do
I am looking for more ram for my computer
Phase4 as is the silicon
00,02altimiter gave uop
Phase I think he has a MB and a normal CP in there some place
00,02up'
you try to bother the order of how it runs
00,02Chrysalis, not really afaik
but it's somethign like 6 500s
you will get into ALL sorts of issues
I would buy new things if I had a job...but they are so hard to get in this econmy
00,02unless you meen the masks, silicon itself is the same stuff they use in desktop cpu's
00,02this will insta explode when i stage
00,02watch
i mean the way its all laid out
00,02in a sec
00,02Chrysalis, well thats the mask
for examply using texture stuff in earlier shader stages will slow down the chip horrifically
http://funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/4027918/There+is+no+sugar+on+the+rape+cake/
Phase4: turn the camera to the sky, that might increse the performance alittle
Let's break the game :D
Who issues best Graphic Cards? Nvidia?
IMHO yeah just
MASF123 depends what you want it for
00,02it'll speed up as i move away from the parts
but it's more or less level
00,02there we go
with each having their quirks
http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/342/085/17c.jpg
yeah
many seem to prefer nvidia cards for gaming though
but you only hav Nvida and ADM these days
NVIDIA chips are a PITA to code for
/me glances longingly to his framed Voodo 3
(fist Graphics card I saved up for my self)
IIRC
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/283/635/900.png
00,02i broke the altimiter
Dumori i still got my old voodoo too
Do you take classes to know about computer things or do you research on your own time?
hell i still got my old p2
and i think i know where my old p1 is
00,02i've got a dual cpu p2 board around here
I have my Dad's old ZX spectrum
00,02cant get it to boot but its here

00,02testing this as a parachute replacment
I really hope that at some point we get an epic Labyrinth 2-parter. Though I guess the Ssn2 premier stole the whole maze-thing's thunder
reason 12 Dumori never streams stuff
But, y'know, a 2-parter devoted to a Bowie-movie-reference
my tast in music is a "intresting"
00,02there we go
00,023KM/s
accel?
:P
00,02thats a good entry speed
well ok got to go
00,02need to see how this works
3KM/s-1 would be how many g
00,02XD
00,02it works
00,02new parachute design found
00,02lots of canards
what is wrong with your space sjip
....
O-o
00,02that was a re-entry
What am I watching? It looks very cool!
00,02tSparx, spaceships
did you know that in fallout new vegas old world blues addon, if you have the wild wasteland perk, the trauma suits say "hey, who turned out the lights"?
Yep
Yay spaceships! Oh hey, I can see me on the screen. Hi Mom!
i knew
00,02damned thing is climbing
Hey everypony
00,02ohai Serenity
is that ship heading anywhere in particular?
wut?
Yes, I'm back again
00,02tSparx, its heading..... here
00,02physics bug
00,02kinda floats around
Found out my mother paid for wireless interent at the campsite
wait I can't work that out I lack a mass...
PYSICS DERP
been what 3-4 years since I did any mecanics of that vain
http://funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/4027713/Pewds/
Dumori: So you're piloting a massless spaceship around? Neat!
nope
I wasw going to work out the G 3KM/s^-1 would be
but you need a mass
FM=A
and all
D.E.D

yep yep
Squalalaaaa
00,02spaceship is still floating
avengers gag reel?
nice
dat altitude
Anyway, Internet doesn't seem to be too fast, but at least I can talk to you guys ;)
Serenity: Happy-dappy internet-having!
Heh, yeah
00,02i dont know how but this thing is pulling 15 g's
I have it until Thursday
X3
ouch
15g
00,02Serenity, what connection are you on now?
poor piolts
would this be worth the money or would it just be better to upgrade the computer you allready have http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/pd/Maingear-SHIFT-Super-Stock-X79/productID.247345300/categoryID.57613200/list.true
00,02Dumori, should have seen what it did on re-entry
Phase4: I'm on a campsite connection in Scotland
00,02ah
00,02cow334, www.microsoftstore.com << theres your problem
I don't think you ship is safe for organics
why is there a giant metal birdie hurtling through the sky?
00,02proud of you microsoft
or most mecianical things stb
00,02ohai SuperBrony64
00,02Dumori, its not safe
00,02infact it should have exploded
00,02several times
00,02it did explode once
Phase4: O-o what but i thought microsoft was good
what was the G on reentry
?
00,02<<< look at stream
00,02thats what their site shows
I can't
cow334: ridiculosuly overpriced, if i ever saw it
00,02"The request to this fragment failed. The request to this fragment failed. The request to this fragment failed. "
Phase4: What the hell?
my PC is busy eatting my bandwidth with other things
00,02Dumori, i'll check what it was when the misson ends
plus I'm trying to "code"
That is one wierd rocket. And I'm seeing one sweet lighting system.
00,02it records max g-force
to really loud eceltronic music that's mostly German
like that good old days
00,0224.5G
horizontaly
cow334: if you want that hardware, get the parts somehwere else. you could probabyl half the cost
ok thats death to any man
like eye poping brain hermerage death
Hi everypony :)
Damn, that rocket is huge
00,02i've bugged the game out
UMG, U BRAEOK IT
00,02Dumori, thats 'your face and your butt are now occupying the same space' level gforce
not quite
you can hold 17g in the right orientation for a while
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates August 21st (Morning)
Actually, that G at a constant rate should kill you
Quickly
Â in a series of rocket sled deceleration experiments culminating in a late 1954 test in which he was clocked in a little over a second from a land speed of Mach 0.9. He survived a peak "eyeballs-out" force of 46.2 times the force of gravity, and more than 25Â g for 1.1 sec, proving that the human body is capable of this. Stapp lived another 45 years to age 89, but suffered lifelong damage to his vision from this last te
in fact 25g is survile able
it has been survied
but I doubt it was only a small peak
i think the highest g-force bearable over periods of time is somehwere at 10? with 9 being the safety-limit for combat pilots?
I 'm gonna get a computer from dell instead
It's 10, yes
im tired of microst
Dumori: only in impuklse form though
10 is the black out range for most humans IIRC
but 12 for a minuet shoudl be no lasting damage for most healthy people
the rest depends on orientation
I haven't really experienced, but the most G I've done is around 4 in a car corning at 70 mph
and it's effect on blood flow
3*
:/
I've hit 5-6 once IIRC
oh yeah Phase4 would you want a man co box for your sandman or a ambassador
no no healthy just horizontally
not vertically
00,02cow334, a what now?
what's that song called anyway?
vertically blood presure across th body goes funky
Phase4: from teamfortress
00,02Dark_Horst, " Alex S. (feat. Ghost) - Melting Pot of Alcohol "
horizontally it's much more constant across th ebody
A crate Phase4
Phase4: thanks
00,02Jmo, i was wondering
Phase4: One of those crates you open with a key
00,02cow334, no
o.o
00,02i've got lots of crates already :(
I sold my HHHH for 3 keys :3
00,02no one wants them
^ You'll be amazed
Phase4: oh what would you want for it i dont know any thing about stuff I have
00,02Serenity, if you have someone who wants crates i've got a bunch
i have crates. anybody wanna?
00,0215 or 20
i have a lot of creates
Phase4: About 70% of the trade server population wants crates
Tf2?
12 if faceing the other way
00,02Serenity, i think they want keys
Nope, crates
00,02if you want the crates you can have
Serenity: where can i find this trade sevrer?
Does bronystate have a trade server
what is your favorite class on team fortress Phase4
Dark_Horst: There's loads
00,02cow334, no real favorite
00,02kinda flip betwene soilder, engi and... i forget the last one
Mine's the Soldier and Snaipah
if you have a favourite class on tf2
00,02soldier'
your not really playing it right
00,02^
heavy. brass beast. nuff said
oh... hmm well would you want a sharpen volcano fragment from pyro
fav has to by pyro or demoknigt
best likly sane demo or engi
night yall
night thegt90
Chrysalis: Actually, that's kinda false, since everyone can play all classes, but simply prefer one out of them all
Scout has mad milk
why wouldn't you choose your class depending on the make up of your team in order to maximize cahnces of success?
that's just shameful
well i dont have that much of a favourite class. but i knwo what my least favourite class os
Buytoast: I think Serenity's saying that you can do both.
its the one thing that bugs me about MvM
after a couple rounds
Buytoast cause I know if I go spy I might as well shot the spawn wall
Have a fav but still play what's needed
your locked into your clas
or you waste too many fund

00,02Chrysalis, i'm planing on a mun run, so this will take a while
I wanna watch the rocket!
i suppose i could try an all enig match
widowmaker is NASTY on MvM
Idon't get why everyone's like OMG SENTRY BUSTUH
00,02assuming it doesnt explode mid way
00,02Dumori, ikr!
because people are fools Serenity
00,02penetrating shots + field of heavys = DOOMED HEAVYS
Phase4: Pack up your sentry, run to it, wait to arm, run away
Serenity large AoE
Phase4: all engi mvm is fun... until an all sentry buster wave runs in
penitartion, speed, no reloand and 100 hp on kill
they'll spend the whole round running away from a buster
rather than let it boom n miss
Chrysalis: Since it comes to you, easily avoidable ;)
00,02woah lag
I love griefing with the Sentry buster
One was chasing me, so I went to 2 other engies and let it explode their stuff
remind me never to play with Serenity
ahahaha
oh god
that's beautiful
Chrysalis: Don't worry, as long as you don't annoy me, I can play quite peacefully
00,02rocket is normally less stable than this
griefing is always fun
00,02lag is making it more stable
00,02Serenity, XD
00,02running from a sentry buster is always fun
00,02they bug out soo hard on doors
00,02Serenity, you know mannworks?
6sec lag heehee
Course I do
Done it like 5 times
I just run past a hole on coal and let the pyro fix them
00,02Serenity, know the brown building?
00,02with stairs on the side?
Yeah, the one in the middle?
00,02you can get a sentry up there
huh
theres a near completion on this server
Where do I recognize that pig noise from?
00,02if all sentrys are up there, and a sentry buster spawns
00,02it insta explodes off the map
Er, Pigs
Lolwut
Good morning, Bronystate
That's...silly
morning Gold_Demona
Hey Gold_Demona :3
Good morning, Gold_Demona :)
/me wants to play MvM now...
Well, I would play TF2
SuperBrony64: u here?
But my Internet avalible isn't really good enough
And my laptop isn't here
Still needs fixing. And El shitbox is still at home, which still can't run it anyway
Dat intermittent music
00,02not sure why thats happening
Phase4: Aliens
Deadspace pretty much
This band just really hates interrupting noises in space that we shouldn't be able to hear.
I'll bet it's your little astronaut dude. He keeps hitting pause to make sure nothing's wrong. =P
I just realized that dragon called Luna tacky! OH NO YOU DIDN'T!
you lost soemthing
Want some space/Comfy music, Phase4 ? =3
00,02my rocket broke
00,02Vordox, yeah
Phase4: No shit
00,02heard all these songs many times
Think we all say around 70 pieces come off :3
00,02MIGHT be able to land this thing
00,02but its not easy
Now brb, because I'm hungry
00,02need a bigger rocket
Phase4: to glory from two steps from hell works good with starting rockets
Phase4: EXPLODE you wont do it you wont you wont do it you eont
Best JRPG i've played <3 Star Ocean 2, nothing have beaten it yet
00,02yeah, not enough power for the mun
Phase4: Can you break orbit and just send it aimlessly floating?
and thus ends my summer. ima go to bed now, cyall
00,02tSparx, i can, not with this rocket though
night twilight_sprinkle
twilight_sprinkle: Night!
Bye twilight_sprinkle :)
Night twilight_sprinkle
Enjoy school
<3 This music. so goooood.
What are you aiming to do, Phase4 ? =/
00,02re-enter
It's 5:55am. I have school tomorrow.
00,02i wanted to reach the mun but that failed
00,02after this might try for all-engie mvm
Just let it drop then? :P
Well... today.
I'm up for that, Phase4 .^^
Phase4: Never give up
Well, gratz, I think you've signed up for no sleep.
I'll play mvm all egin
Phase4: YOUR ROCKET IS THE ROCKET THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS... or at least the atmosphere
woot woot ^^
What you think of the music, Phase4 ? =3
00,02Vordox, its not really my kind of thing
00,02but could work in a game
Phase4: Hmmm... More spacey you want?
00,02space jrpg i assume
00,02hmmm
It's middle, Space and Old World
00,02lets just let it re-enter for now
what about this Phase4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHyHK0fqIrA
Halo doesn't really mix with kerbals getting exploded and murdered
cow334: No links in main chat unless permission
Oh I see Serenity :D
sorry Vordox
Serenity: lol
Serenity: Benny Hill Theme
No. overused
Bumblebee
TTGL OST
OH GOD
00,02very calm re-entry
The DDR "Bumblebee" or the classical "Flight of the Bumblebee"?
Phase4!
00,02Vordox, ?
just play some Spanish Flea
oh god
Whee!
there are some photos of me with god aweful face expressions
from buck
Theme song for Kerbals.
Oh god...
ooh, my favy!
Yes
Awww yeah
Just. Yes
Imagine kerbals space program with this song
00,02first thing i've ever made capable of controled descent
So horrible yet so...
"And let's not forget the Turbodrive!"
Phase4: It... still never left gravity :P
00,02theres the instability
Love how the SAS (is it?) is going batshit crazy to control the ship
wow that's shaking more than an eskimo with parkinsons
Lol, it looks like the rocket is dancing to the music. XD
lol
Tiny Tim <3
woot woot
Altimeter is broken?
that space corn must be shitting his pants
Looks like it's not actually falling anywhere
How many g's is the pilot experiencing just from the rotation, I wonder.
00,02i'm staying in the one spot
00,02this is getting us nowhere
lol
Haha
blow him up
Phase4: nose down, rocket on, BEAT THE SYSEM!
he knew the risks
Do you have a rocket still attached to your ship?
00,02parachute is all wierd
Or can you get it to straighten out for a moment?
00,02i think thats actually the direction we're moving
00,02also i think we are gaining altitude
How is that even, I mean, is your spaceship just super-light or something? It seems like its terminal velocity would still be REALLY FAST DOWNWARD
00,02using the rocket for a vapor trail
tSparx: physics in this game get all wonky with certain designs
lol
lol, This seems oddly fitting. XD
That very unfitting music...
lol
Vordox: that very fitting music
This is actually kinda fitting in a strange way
Is it just me or is the altimeter broken?
I think Phase4 is just grinning :P
lol
00,02Vordox, :3
It's Rocket Ballet he's probably doing right now :D
He broke physics
This music is going to be fitting for a few seconds.
00,02eventually this thing will land
"Eventually"
Maybe
00,02aeiou
lol who ever picked the mario brothers music is awesome this gose perfect with this
I think they forgot how to gravity
Woot woot ^^
Can't you make it become still?
i still say you should blow it up
Snake! Snake! SNAAAAAAAKE!
It almost looks like it IS falling, but the camera angle is changing to obscure it.
Phase4: Isn't it spinning faster and faster?
00,02i'm honestly not sure what its doung
And now it's gaining attitude
:D
Are you sure you haven't escaped the planet's gravity and returned to the planet just to taunt it's gravity? =P
00,02the parachute's angle looks soo strange
Turn off the engine phase
what is up with that ship...
lol]
00,02Gold_Demona, that would explain a lot
00,02MegaMoonShine, its on VERY low
00,02just to generate a trail so i have some refference
00,02plus the engine itself is like farting
mai Space ship gose soi soi soi soi soi
00,02doesnt move much
most annoying built ship ever =P
OH I KNOW
Phase4: !
Well, if you keep accelerating the rotation of the ship, eventually internal stress will solve your landing problem.
!
We HAVE PARACHUTE
Also, dat Star man theme XD
Kinda...
Woop
It'll provide enough drag to straighten it out.
lol!
lol
00,02soo much music request
00,02also the parachute broke
HOW DID IT BREAK!?
00,02right now i'm straight up hovering
00,02Vordox, bug
You were like super slow as hell
it'll never end
00,02yeah
00,02as i said
00,02bug
Hello, nameless pony!
Wow...
Aww,just a few minute too late for "Spin me right round baby"
XD
Would have done it faster, bleh
Not exactly spinning there Phase4 :D
Can't you break off the wings somehow?
alright now it's just fucking with you
00,02cant spin
Phase4: Can't you just fire your rocket at this point?
00,02the damned thing is stable
Yup. I knew it. You're just taunting gravity.
Oh no wait, you're facing up
00,02tSparx, i could
Phase4: Never build anything stupid like this again? XD
00,02i could detatch and fall
00,02but that would kill...
00,02'Edbin'
Oh no, poor "Named" Kerbals
I think ths song would be AweSOME for a kerbal montage
:D
What's the name of this ship, Phase4 ? Dandelion?
00,02real problem is i broke the altimiter
00,02Vordox, 'Pinkie Pie'
....Makes sense
BWAHAHAHA YES
i still say it should be the S.S. Fuckitall
LOL That explains everything!
00,02i'ma go get some food
Well, maybe he'll live.
Nah, that way when its tail wiggles you know there's a meteor show
shower*
Phase4: Starting up TF2 while you do that
halo OST?
woot woot halo 2
oh crap
This isn't the Halo 2 theme -- this is the original theme, and I love it!
MLP stuff is actually gettin to the UK now
my poor bank account
Chrysalis: you lucky bastards
Or maybe it's not, idk. But I love the not-mjolnir-mix versions of this theme.
Vordox: can you add me on steam
germany is a fim-merch wasteland
the uk is usually
but there seems to be a big blindbag wave comin
and then the t-shirts that are out soon
cow334: I don't even know you
Dark_Horst: I'll trade you FIM-merch for German auto engineering. Send a Veyron my way if I help you complete your collector's set? :P
Vordox: Just asking you don't have to if you dont want to
howdy bronies
Howdy!
hello Thunder-Crescent
howdy Thunder-Crescent :)
did anyone else hear some pirate just now?
cow334: Meh fine :P
Just add me
Yeah
TheRealVordox
No that was phase's Avast
Chrysalis: >2012 >still nothing much at all related to MLP in New Zealand
Vordox: I cant
cow334: ?
Vordox: I have to purchase something first
cow334: Ooookay?
No for real
tSparx: had you asked me a few months ago i could've sold you a golf4 in varying states of repair :P
Vordox: My name is cow224
Dark_Horst: xD
hey, it's still volkswagen
Couldn't even offer a Pheiton (sp), no
haha
woot woot
XAX, I'm gonna have to ask you stay still xD
Edbin's probably ready to take a nap by now.
tSparx: Cant help it ;~;
Phase4: How come you havent fallen yet
I figured, just teasing xP~
Your ship looks like it is just still
cow334: it is
cow334: he built a ship that makes the game ignore physics. This is the result.
cow334: The ship forgot how to gravity
Basically
tSparx: wwhhaaatt Gold_Demona is that even possible
cow334: Sure, in a video game ;)
cow334: It is when your ship is named "Pinkie Pie. =P
00,02cow334, physics got bored
lol
^^das^^
Wait then dose that mean it's just going to stay like that
ForEEEVVVEEEERRRRRRR~
phase4 I built a ship powered by flaps and ASS
Dramatic music is dramatic
you "trun" a few times then asa kicks in a spazzy the flapps like a mad man
How about a ship powered by love and friendship?
and suddenly free power
00,02Dumori, is it a 0.16 craft?
Oh
.`5
00,02i found one for 0.15 on the fourms
That. Fucking. Boss. The improsoned
00,02ah
.15
it might still work in .16
not tryed
00,02its not falling
The Legend of Groose
00,02Dumori, nah, they changed some of the core stuff
00,02this craft is hovering
I know but I've nto tryed
00,02as in its not losing altitude
so it might still work
00,02average altitude anyway
00,02and its gaining speed
cos it's actually producing thrust from flapping
00,02Dumori, thats just it
00,02it isnt
it's a orhocopter
00,02sas is of
00,02off'
00,02i'm not touching any controlls
no my plane that uses sas to fly
well phases ship broke physics
...
ossim possim
It's SO CLOSE
Or is it?
LAWL
lol
FECK YOUR PHYSICS
No, no it's not
Awww....
Ded
He lived, ish
NNNNOOOO
abort
R.I.P. Edbin. :<
00,02sooo
00,02two plans
00,02Gold_Demona, he broke the laws of physics
00,02the punishment for which is death
lol
xD
Only Pinkie Pie may legally break physics
they should give them a reward for doing that not death
00,02pinkie pie is not legally alowed
00,02they've just never managed to catch her
lol
^^das^^
00,02now
00,02two plans
00,02a: all engie MvM
00,02if we can organize 6 players
00,02b: Amnesia
00,02i'd rather not b
ill be up for mvm
i'd mvm
me to
and i
Ill play mv m
What was b: again? I've forgotten.
00,02that was fast
*buh da boom, ching*
00,02tSparx, a terrificly designed game
00,02that is terrifying
Aleady ready to join Phase4
00,02too bad wrek isnt online
00,02or is
00,02either way, guns of icarus would be fun
Well, he's the one who just booted Vordox
Actually Phase4 ...I can get some more tickets if you want to
00,02tSparx, thats a script
Phase4 IKR
Phase4: Question: Have you played or plan to play Darksiders II yet?
they finally added parties
Bots took our jobs
00,02Vordox, not really looking foward to another advance mode
00,02i meen yes and no, not now at least
Hehe
00,02wonder what map the server is on
00,02aww, its decoy
Phase4: Can we try the endurance match?
00,02already done all engi on decoy
Phase4: What's wrong with Decoy?
I've only played like 3 maps out of the 6 ones.
00,02Serenity, already completed all engie on it
Play SNAIPAH then
Hide in the brown house, and you win
Umg, Ballooniorn
wait Phase4 all engin
Phase4 Nyx isnt on decoy atm
00,02could try nix
00,02nyx;
i'm connecting
00,02mannworks will be interesting with all engi
00,02Serenity, i opened a bunch of crates, two of them were balloonicorns
00,02kept one, gifted the other
OHHHH you were not talking about actually crates earlier, haha
Phase4: Son of a bitch, I got freaking strange weapons, no hats
When I joined back in, I was wondering why you were going to ship Serenity a bunch of crates.
which server is this?
Well, I'm all outta keys, I only had 3
Phase4: which series is that?
But I can do some more conning for keys
Wish I got Bills hat
I bought L4D a few days AFTER the deal
Engies everywhere
hey phase 4, what's this server ip and such
i aint got this one it seems
Man, modern FPS's are so confusing >_>
Also http://sporkbot.tumblr.com/post/29863949432/love-and-tolerance
please tell me you guys know how to take a joke
ahaha
that seems about right
CrimsonPhoenix: Depends, if it's funny. If it's not, death ensues
Serenity just read the thing
11,02Sleepies time is soon for me /).(\
SuperBrony64, why aren't you sleeping even
Anyone else joining?

Well, that was a waste of 5 minutes.
Besides, any sane person would have just shot him in the face already ;)
Or is that just me?
Phase4: When a Sentry Buster aririves, Pack your sentry and run to him, wait for him to arm, thenr un away
night SuperBrony64
O__o the fuck are those? Bomb robot ostriches?
MadSurge: They are called Sentry Busters
And they are literally bombs on legs
Serenity: not really following TF2, sorry :D
MadSurge: At least I'm not alone ;)
MadSurge: Don't worry about it, it's still only a couple days old
is the server full?
I've played TF2 since release week 2007
11,02Night cow334 :)
SuperBrony64: Moo ^^ may the cows be with you
/me hugs SuperBrony64 tightly
Anyway, I'm off. Nice to meet y'all, thanks for being a cool channel ;)
pony up boys
Well, you met around 40% of the regs, so yeah, no newbies are online yet
/me hugs Serenity back tightly ^-^
I've considered joining a game, but I've never played the game other than the tutorial...
Gold_Demona: Don't worry, I've played TF2 for 5 years, and I still can't play a demoman
im an engineer
"Engi's a goner" lol, which one? XD
I love heavies death messages
I died, and heard one go "SOLJUH IS DED"
sentry power
pony up boys
Is it me or do I keep hearing Saxton Hale?
When a sentry buster arrives
My god, I feel like I've been up ages, yet I've only been up an hour
Serenity i STOLE YOUR ENERGY i'VE BEEN UP 19 AND i FEEL LIKE i JUST WOKE UP

Right, I need to finish my line of sight mechanic
Phase4 i just crashed
00,02i see
00,02Chrysalis, rejoin?
is the server full Phase4 ?
00,02we need our scout
00,02d3rb, yes and no
00,02sumi was spectation but he left
ah okie dokie
00,02Chrysalis, rejoin Quickly?
00,022 minutes till start
00,02some silly pressed the ready button
um
I can scoot
currently loading
I wish I had a better Computer
Laptop I'm on is even worse then shitbox, but shitbox can't run TF2, and my Laptop can't really run it that well
pony up boys
time to start saving for an upgrade Serenity
Serenity shoudl I tell you the specs of my old PC that I played pro on
in 08-10
Alright,
cos it's slag
nvid 5200LE
ADM 2200+
in 1 sentence
512mb ram ddr2
LOL
lol
I knew it :P
should have done it in a single sentence
Also, that's still better than shitbox
Bahahaha
/me shugs
it don matter I have an alt on here
Dumori: Those specs are still better than Shitboxe's
hehehe
that got 15fps top on tf
9 on a bad day
I kicked but
does shitbox have a rat in a spining wheel for a pwer supply or something?
on severs in Aus
IDK how I was good with that much lag but I was
d3rb: No, it's just as powerful as a calculator from WWII
retro :)
512 MB DDR, Ati Radeon 2400, 1.6 gh/z pentium 4 processor.
hehehe
yeah
hell yeah p4, my old computer has a p4 1.7
Not DDR2, not DDR3, but DDR
I got my 2200+ to 2.4gz
cos overclocking king
fyi that ram might just be DDR
Overclocking on my machine would probably set it on fire :S
I'm unsure
yit will be ddr1 no doubt
sd at worst though :D
Guys, did you know
That my 512 MB of RAM is DDR
braking the silence
hey guys
howdy
Hello
Anyone here?
how you doing Thunder-Crescent and Anotherguy
Good.

That's why there are too many engies...they are too close
Serenity: dat computer

They have different flavors
i can't peanut butter my dick in your ass
/me runs
Horrible joke.
But I can jam your butt
Phase4: Before you go asking me, I am not equipped for TF2.
You need medicine to play TF2?
Are they in a Mann up server or Boot camp?
I am
Phase4: My nana has an old HUGE compaq desktop. runs Win98. Gonna get it off her once she gets all her photos off it. I bet it'll run doom 2 like a champ.

Ello there, everypony.
00,02speaking of which
Hi Malavolent
Malavolent: hai
how you doing Malavolent
alexxm: As usual, it would be great here if it weren't so freaking hot.
00,02when your laggign a fairly powerfull machine with ksp your doing it right
I really don't bear hot weather well.
its working :P
Malavolent: you sound like my husband. =/
:D
Gold_Demona: how have you been instead?
Gold_Demona: Don't lie, girls don't watch MLP.
Malavolent: he/she never said he/she was a girl
:O
00,02i blame discord
PsychoticDoc: It was either homosexual or girl. I tried the latter.
I dont think it really matters
Gold_Demona: everyone at BUCK said it was so friggin' hot, but I thought it was perfectly warm! Maybe it's me, it gets really hot around here in summer :D
im new so, whats BUCK?
a convention
oh ok, thanks
Well it's never really hot in UK
a brony one specifically
Hot weather complainging is fo chumps, im stuck in 80% humidity for the most part of my life
^
I like humidity.
I should move to UK.
It's acclamitsing that's the issue
But then again, there are weird people.
I dont, unecissary sweating just aint all dat cool
The uk is X for so long
MadSurge it was absolutely roasting in the party
That our yearly hot month is a shock if it's actually hot
Da BUCK is the brony uk convention
Chrysalis: yeah, with that I agree
oh :3
and was held this weekend
00,02oh god the lag
00,02soo much lag
00,02even when i try to make it faster
im in OR :/
kill that thing with its performance and whatnots
00,02i have to throttle down a smidge
00,02problem is the frame rate is soo low, i cant
00,02the slightest tap sends it to half throttle
Everytime you launch the shuttle - photoalbum.
00,02well here goes nothing
come on phase4! You got dis!
i wonder if there are secret haters here just waiting to strike :O
probably
00,02i need Less lag
Da: its very unlikely
Da: Haven't seen any haters here since I've joined.
but possible?
what kind of a beast is needed to run this smoothly?
I hate many people.
It's not a secret.
a terrible beast
Everyone does.
kill them all
A magnificent beast?
kill the corn people
Buytoast: i hate literally evrybody until they can give a reason not to
and the tomato people
guilty untill proven inocent PsychoticDoc ?
This isn't supposed to happen
That's a good way of thinkin doc.
oh god its going down
d3rb: its essentialy court
00,02the bottom stage is lagging everything
I think the right direction should be up.
never know who you can trust nor like these days
Phase4:
00,02cow334
á¶ à² á´¥à² á¶ï»¿ crash
00,02should restart itself
:l its broken
i get that to a point but you cant hate everyone, even if some people really deserve it PsychoticDoc
00,02this thing is soo much heavier
00,02and yet it floats anyway
woot woot
you gotta love and tolerate
:3
I dont realy like the term love and tolerate any more
oh well that is just me
way overslept this morning O_o - thats what I get for staying up til 2
:/
d3rb: I have really low tolerance for people, im actually unsually really not social
i just like, dont be a jerk
woot woot ^^

Malavolent: Hmm... *checks inside shirt and pants* Yup pretty sure.

If i were streaming then I am streaming Xbox and Wii :p
On Xbox i stream...
killerpony7733 there was nothing wrong with how everything was planned
Skyrim..
had the audience more questions all would of been well
Need for speed and sims 3 pets.
i have nothing to do :L
Chrysalis: True true, Still it could had been a little mor smooth but else i agree
more*
killerpony7733 really? i thought it went incredibly smooth
no major delays which is what i was expecting
a couple of no-shows but they were outside of control
Chrysalis: Well i just thought from what i could gather that everyone that got up on the stage there wasn't really prepared or anything like that
It was a bit random
oh no, not at all
still rather fun
:) my cats are barking at me
:D
cats can bark?
Cats can do anything.

indubiadly
00,02this rocket seems to be working

Ninjazz|Quiet: because Rarity is fabulous!
Oh lawd
MadSurge, Yes!
Serenity:flu shots arent good for you...
Goddamit, flash died
ERMAGERD IT SPINS
Uhm, not to complain, but there's water down there.
Phase4: what you think

Ninjazz|Quiet: there was also a blonde girl with a full Fluttershy fursuit :3
Make sure you don't fall in the ocean

that suiccccide... Kidz GL
00,02nut its all the way over there
00,02but'
00,02and i'm going this way already
At least it's not hovering this time
did your diretion somehow change?
MadSurge, Hmmm. A little interested.
yesh
It's going slow down
I think gravity is broken
more zelda
so it's looking good
Serenity:if you think flu shots are good for you there not AND you dont need them because the germs make you sick its not because you dont have a flu shot and i havent got sick in like what? 2 years?
or is it just me
This is looking promising
This music is awesome. =D
sonicandmario85: That wasn't my message at all. I said you should have a good immune system
^
00,02damned things gliding too well
Dummeh is so good at these.
Serenity:i already do i had a flu shot when i was a baby but it wasnt one that wasnt good for you but it was a healthy one
You need to get outside and all and avoid being in sterile enviroments cause if you do, Your chances of getting deadly ill or just badly is high
dat non-aerodynamic gliding
DAH DAH DA DAAA
HAY GUURLZZ
YOU GOT A THIIIIIIING~
Phase4: try this on next http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rLLVDck4xE&list=PLAE1C556AFD532944&index=60&feature=plpp_video if you want to
MARIO
So much awesome music. =D
killerpony7733: My immune system is really good, but colda really really get me
do do od od odo dodo od o
Ninjazz|Quiet: http://i.imgur.com/gQsXe.jpg sideways -__- these aren't mine anyways
woot woot ^^
Oh great, now it will rain
Slowest descent ever :D
Oh look. it's pissing it down
Serenity: Yep same, I in the run of a year get sick less then 10 times with the time very largely spread inbetween
No seriously. it's raining
I think he accidentaly broke gravity, MadSurge
sonicandmario85: the purpose of flu-shots is to keep your immune system up to date. antibodies always configure to most frequent and recent threats. flu-shots are basically practice runs for them
No wonder this thing blows up easily its made of some sort of cardboard and alot of fuel its glidding like a butter through knife
Jim: :D
Dark_Horst: Exactly and vaccines or that helps quickly building immunity towards certain things
Phase4: what you think about these songs
Dark_Horst:god didnt give us flu shots when us humans were made WE DONT NEED THEM
MadSurge, Hmmm. Can't get into it. :$
sonicandmario85: Other than the life expecancy being < 30
00,02cow334, when they say 'synthetic orchestra' they meen it, it lacks the blending you get in natural sound
00,02BUT
Ninjazz|Quiet: a little creepy but also cute :D
sonicandmario85: it's a simulated flu infection with deativated virus cells so that your immune system canr eact if thereÃs a real flu virus in your bloodstream
00,02it is very well done
00,02not fair to compair synthetic stuff to real, cant really record an orchestra propperly
sonicandmario85: yes, god didnt give us flu shots, which is why people died of flu all the time before modern emdicine
You can't ever get immune to Flu, since there's more than 150 different types at once
sonicandmaario85: God didn't give us shots for anything. Which is why he gave us the ability to make medicine. =/
MadSurge, creepy yes... Cute?... Well, perhaps if he or she was a bit shorter. :$
00,02Serenity, what if you caught all 150?
Phase4: Say your prayers, dude
Phase4: thanks woot woot ^^ would you want to hear more
Phase4, Gotta catch 'em all.
Dark_Horst:i havent taken any flu shots and it seems my bodys doing pretty fine
your choice
phase, then you are a pokemon master
00,02Boltasar, XD
although, there are 101
151*
Gotta catch 'em all!
Serenity: You techinally have a near immunity to it, But some things can adapt and change quickly surprising your immune system not being able to know if that's it or not
*cough sneeze choke*
I'm talking about viruses, not fookin' pokkymans
00,02i know far too much abotu the original pokemon games
00,02though mostly tech details
Ninjazz|Quiet: http://i.imgur.com/YKD2X.jpg faraway pic of the girl without the 'Shy head
00,02i like how i'm not piloting this rocket
00,02its just gliding
Why are we arguing about flu shots?
sonicandmario85: May i ask. Do you spend your time away from people and usually only being indoors?
00,02and its a rocket
Phase4: I know too much too, like several ways to do the missingo glitch, AND I NEVER PLAYED THE GAMM...
mah, the rocket is descending so slowly that I thought my stream froze for a moment
GAME*
Phase4 is best rocket glider
killerpony7733:yes
sonicandmario85: that good either mean that you have a strong immune system or didnt get in contact enough with flu. the latter would that if you get infected with it, the next one'S gonna be a nasty fucker
whos here from Melbourne Australia... Wondering
*could mean
Phase4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnCNCqaPr-g&list=PLAE1C556AFD532944&index=66&feature=plpp_video
Nope, I'm Lincs, England
i actually fogot this was bronystate XD
00,02Boltasar, i've played all three (red, blue, yellow) and have performed both the misingno glitch as well as the working mew glitch
Phase4: I know its not real orchestra but it stil sounds very nice
00,02i have a pokemon blue cartridge with two mew's on it
germs make you sick not the planet
00,02cow334, they do sound nice
Most bacteria is useful
sonicandmario85: Well bad news. You are techinally in a sterile enviroment and having never taken flu shots or anything- You are highly and i caps it HIGHLY in danger of getting sick very quickly if when you begin to having to go out and be near people
Phase4: but green exists, in japan...
Phase4: yup
00,02Boltasar, havent played it because japanese
OMG Donkey Kong Country was my childhood!
DKC IS BEST GAME EVER

This is a nostalgia trip this music right here
Dummeh, y u brilliant?
00,02wasnt untill 3rd gen that the games had any reall differences, and even then they were mostly meeningless
Serenity, Never had a N&4
killerpony7733:and you can make yourself sick by thinking you are yes the human minds that strong
N64*
Donkey Kong Country <3
00,02bad guys wore blue instead of red kinda things
Jim: WHAT? Deeeewwweeed. Buy one
sonicandmario85: Well that's what it does. But i'm talking long term health and ability to do things around people
sonicandmario85: somethig entirely else
I bet you could get an N64 for 30 euros
00,02almost there
Why are we still arguing over sickness?
Goldeneye 64 <3
i have a cold :l
Banjo Tooie :3
sonicandmario85: One is mind power and fooling yourself, The other is a actual threat to your body
beats me Gold_Demona

Hahaha, the music goes so well to the spinning

Serenity, Awesome!
Heya Gold_Demona and MegaMoonShine :)

sonicandmario85: Still not a healthy way to go, Your body becomes more unstimulated and practiced with every day germs and bacteria and it gets weaker.
Heya HiImSpike :)
hello HiImSpike
sometimes i just go outside and sit out there or i chase the chicken around the yard XD
sonicandmario85: Cause you will have to go out one day and spend time around people.

Sad music before they all die horribly
this cant end well
nvm
sonicandmario85: here'S the thing with preemptive vaccines and antibiotics: vaccines are injections mainly with nonfunctional virus cells so that your anibodies get a genetic blueprint of what they have to defend against. flu shots reinforce your immune system. if you've been sick and took medicine, you've probabyl taken antibiotics. the problem with those is that they are NOT healthy. quite the opposite. antibiotics are like napalm st
BronyInstrumental: play more online, or mods, both can extend the game quite a bit
whoa,w all
Te-te-te-text wall.
lol
Dark_Horst:it was the try a medic medicene or whatever its called
regular shots are a lot healteir for you than getting sick and curing it
Dark_Horst:it was for kids too
flu shots are still ebtter
ugh, gotta restart my computer... brb gurlzz
Boltasar: i used the tekkit mod pack, and only ever played online. still bored after a week
Phase4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qLpwObLgfw&list=PLAE1C556AFD532944&index=51&feature=plpp_video another one
Or you can just get a medic to Ã¼bercharge you right before the viruses and bacteria attacks you
I DONT NEED NO FUCKIN FLU SHOTS I DO WHATEVER THE FUCK I WANT WITH MY LIFE
);<
:*
We are just telling it's not a good way to go
BronyInstrumental: agreed i got bored real quickly of it.
You know for a 10 year old you tend to swear quite abit.
And then sonicandmario85 got sick.
alrighty then
BronyInstrumental: tekkit modpack... Equivalent Exchange kills the need of making awesome redstone contraptions or huge buildcraft machines
How much music does that guy do?
Love how the kerbel people have no cities on their planet and yet they have the knowledge to build giant spaceships
Heya Jmo :)
I HAVE GOTTEN SICK IN LIKE 2 YEARS

sonicandmario85: Still you haven't gotten so due to being in a enviroment your body knows well. If you spend more time with people and what not. You would be very quick with getting sick

Ohey look! There's wittle kerbal scientists walking around.
and back
BronyInstrumental: At it's current state, I agree.
killerpony7733:sometimes my bro jojo visits or my other bro david
figaro all the things
I recon living in space is really bad. Having to live in cramped enviroment, bones deteriating and ears are slowly becoming blunt and most being sucked by the vacuum of space
xD sunddenly opera in the chat :P
sonicandmario85: Still not too bad for your body, It was talking with generally being outside and not in your house and everything
HiImSpike, that's why you have to go through ALOT of tests and exams before you're taken into space.

WHAT A FINISH
sonicandmario85: and that's why there' vaccines. they use a wide spectrum of different virus dns to make your immune system able to defend against most virus variations. dryruns for other environments, so to soeak

You can even use the wiirimote to turn your monitor into a multitouch tablet
True crowd was a bit nope. They didn't even ask anything
Wrek: I was watching from everfree radio it looked awesome hope you had fun
Hopefully more asking and talking will be up next year
ded?

:p that sudden stop in the chat
Eeyup
MaxTheBrony: I take it you want to go to next years B.U.C.K?
I wish i could :S
it would be cool if, next year, if there's another bronystate community panel they let all the bronystater atendees up to the panel too. that'd be cool
Hmm anything stopping you?
Family , friends
Im not that outward as a brony aswell... im too "shy"
or weak*
BronyInstrumental: Umm that's what happend, But it was very poorly thought out in that they suddenly asked the bronystaters to come up, Instead of telling them the panel will be there and they are welcome to go up there and be part of it
/me slaps MaxTheBrony around a bit with a large trout
08,01WREK!

GilDash|Gaming, in all honestly, everypony like's to be appreciated, but I'm always used to be the working horse, I like a thank's here and there naturally, but usually I rather enjoy putting up stuff to make others happy (even if it requires me to take the charge of things for a while), for example ordering that Pizza for the crew, and forcing most to eat some...
05who is Pony_Zen?

Serenity: sumicas face? i never seen him ever

Gott mit uns, as we all stand united, all together Gott mit uns
And mabye Unarmed, if I can survive being without a single weapon
GilDash|Gaming: Welp we can always continue reminding him
05too bad the lyrics dont match up pony_zen :<
I know...
05Serenity: if you brohoof properly
GilDash|Gaming: But a alot more planned out and more informed BS panel for any bronystaters that want to get up there should be a good thing
05it can be used as a mean of self defense
funny thing is, I think I actually understand some of them, Wrek
Well, if you can stand left handed hooves, I'd probably break my wrist brohoofing
well wrek knows about music
GilDash|Gaming: I'm thinking more of the, ''If you want to go up to the panel and be part of it. You are free to do so'' way
killerpony7733: That's what we tried to do early on. No one wanted to come up. XD
what language is this?
I'm gonna go dressed as my most classiest self

05this is more epic metal
05and im not meanign epic as in the term awesome
Major: You don't complain when I use it. ;)
Wrek: you should listen to firewind some time
05im meanign like theres folk metal, glam metal
05and epic metal
i think power or battle metal is a good way of phrasing it
05albeit this is one of the less emtally songs
05with a touch og glam
GilDash|Gaming: well dont bother to use on me, apparently GL owns me for 3 days :$
:3 epic metal is good
Pony_Zen: That's far too much science for me right now. Let me recover first. XD
Wrek: did you forget the body below the table of the pony in the middle with his head on the table?
Major: Take a camera with you. ;)
05Spectrum_Rush: why sketch it out if its gona be black under the table?
GilDash|Gaming, I did leave the science out of the con at least didn't I :3
GilDash|Gaming: well she did say 1 other pony can come with us :P
tru, but you should still be able to see it is all for the perspective atleast
Wrek: ^
Pony_Zen: Ah, so *that's* why we didn't have a fire! :D
Major: If that's an offer... ;)
GilDash|Gaming: well all you need is a tumblr and show her your OC and your all set :P
Major: Tsk, somepony already drew me my OC... ;)
Pony_Zen think of evolution as stats in a game, what humanity sacrifices physicaly, we more than make up for in unholy levels of intelligence. Well, most of us anyway>_> yes Im looking at you politics.
GilDash|Gaming: I know :P
GilDash|Gaming: Doh ho ho ho. Iknow who your talking about ;)

More Pirate Rarity? :D
Major: Tell her to get her flank on Bstate too sometime. :)
MadSurge: Umm... no? :p
GilDash|Gaming: I will :P
nice drawing
HALLO EVRYPONY
DoctoDoctorWho, I do not argue with the fact our species have superiour intelligence (at least from all the species we know), but I still find our some of our disadvantages unnecessary by all logical sense. I mean, we have brains and technology the prevent a lot worse from coming or more likely being, but still... There could be so much more, we have examples of people with perfect memory, without they never even having to work for
it, perfect cardio, as in my previous link, and much more... with the fun fact, they only have small DISadjustments... It's like evolution is trying to keep us from beng more superior on purpose, which defies all logic.
Tl;dr
yo wtfflutter
Saw that coming a mile away. :D

Pff, I got a jar of dirt

Lil_B: you went to GalaCon? I went to BUCK! :$
Peguins live inside of it
MadSurge, same
I went to the restroom :'(
Lil_B: Holla! :)

Bonjur GilDash|Gaming

Pony_Zen in a sec XD
Lil_B, realized too late I could have afforded your flight too... :/
Much clearer now
05rarity with a golden pegleg ecrusted with precious jewels and spikes scales
I got some dirt from Sjin Independant Trader
Wrek: of course
05it also has a hidden spike in it
MadSurge I wanted to see the Lievstream of BUCK on Bronystate, but on SaSunday my Internet connection went out for 2 days :(
In the pegleg?
Kakumy: haha :D
05Anotherguy aye
Huh
What was BUCK?
Lil_B: aw, too bad!
Wrek: one day you should draw Homage and LittlePip together unless you did... just telling..
Did you want to do this Wrek, originally, or is this because of that commission you did at BUCK?
mitamaking: A UK brony convention
MadSurge butr the videos showed me that it was better than GalaCon XD more people, more Cosplay, better Location and more/more interesting guests of Honor and better organisation
Ah, last weekend?
Lil_B, would you join us in any UK meet if I got ye the flights?
So Rarity has a jar of dirt then Wrek? :P
Lil_B: the CMC panel was great :$
Captain Jack Rarity :D
mitamaking: F'ing amazing, that's what.
Lil_B: if only I could have gone to Everfree!
It looks like a jar of mud from here...
That is 3 cons last weekend at least, I went to Brony Beach Minicon and Everfree North was last weekend too
05Merri: the guy gave me the idea
woo...attack level 92
05the digital one i made at buck sucked
05so now im doign it properly
I wish I could draw as good as this. :I
Ah
Merri: don't be sad :(
Practice is your friend.
Pony_Zen maybe, talkt to me when the time comes, I will check everything then
Fair enough. :P
05brb grabbin a bite and something to drink
Lil_B: but one of the organizers, Perrydotto, is awesome and a delight to talk with! (she also was at BUCK and she's a fellow Ponygoon!)
true Jmo... true..
fair enough, need more familiar names to next one :P Lil_B
Who is the guy?
AJIsAwesome: you watch RoosterTeeth?
Kakumy: Of course.
AJIsAwesome: well sorry Michael hates AJ :P
Pony_Zen next Meetup in Frankfurt is on September first, I will be there again :)
Kakumy: :(
Bronycon never happens in Asian countries... most are Anime..
the Frankfurt is just so damn expensive to travel :/
Kaumy: you make it sound like it is a bad thing.
Dreamtale :3
killerpony7733 any close to finish ?
I got a jar of dirt! I got a jar of diet! I got a jar of dirt! And guess what's inside it!?! ^^
MadSurge I liked the Legends of Equestria Panel at GalaCon and... well, just talking to people XD really, it didn't felt like a special thing, more like a big meetup
*dirt
Wrek, I'll kindly remind you that I love you now :3 J. Aho <3
Diet?
Sabershy|Cleaning: Yes it is... I will never experience Bronycon :(
Kakumy: At least they get anime conventions. There aren't any conventions where I live.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Yeah yeah. Quickly eating my dinner which should be 5-10 minutes
âª
âªâª
make one
killerpony7733 k
If Anime I'll just go to K-ON, Haruhi, Naruto and some others...
Kakumy: I won't to get to experience either. :\
heh awesome
Lil_B: but it was a meetup about PONIES <3 BUCK was so much fun
Chrysalis: I don't even know how or if I should.
Btw when is Season 3 releasing... people say Aug then some say Sept...
I'm back
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
MadSurge there were 4 cannons
Lil_B, also I'm busy pushing Fins to handle next Helsinki meet up
So Season 3 not confirm yet 100% at all..
Chrysalis: EVEN BETTER
Kakumy: Nope.
all went off at once
Amazing.... and Wrek takes forever to get a drink and snack
Lil_B: If you go next year, you'll meet me
2 drinks and 2 snacks
05back
So do I know any of you from BUCK?
05adn the snack ended up being about half a pizza
Oh as soon i said you come back :P
Lil_B: And I'd have welcomed you with open arms. :)
Wrek: Some snack
Lil_B, (GilDash and PONY)
Wrek: um....half a pizza IS a snack
Wrek, I'll kindly remind you that I love you now :3 J. Aho <3
Kakumy: we're getting pony comics though, real quality comics! :D
especially if it is thin crispy crust
:O
Pony_Zen how many meetups do you visit?
So Wrek you said "the guy" gave you the idea...who is the guy?
Lil_B, apparently many
i like thin crust more than thick crust..
I love deep pan
05some guy that was in the audience of the bronystate live event
Merri was there?
Can't stand pussy crust
Lil_B, and apparently I'm trying to help on as many as possible
GilDash|Gaming and Serenity I|m so goin to BUCK next ZEAR!!! even if I have to skip GalaCon 2013 for it!!!!
Yeah, I was the slenderman.
xD
AWESOME!
you were badass
Lil_B: Peh. screw galacon
Slondermon
Oh I see
Lil_B, don't be afraid to ask help with the flights from me
MadSurge: If my friend was never angry at this girl I would be saying MLP is gay... lucky I ended up to knew
Go to BUCK, I promise I won't be armed
Wayup gomro

Wrek: im still recovering form that

Pony_Zen, Lil_B: And of course, if you need a driver... ;)
Wrek: What are you on about? My wrist is only snappable because the links are weak
Kakumy: that sounds quite the story :D
GilDash|Gaming, /)
Pony_Zen: (\
SING LIKE A STAAAAAR
Ponies47: Same here.....:(
MadSurge: Ya... though Teens React could make me at least to watch 1 episode...

GilDash|Gaming you are all so wondeful :'( I hope I will keep all uf this up for 1 year
hello :3
next year will be awesome
sonicandmario85: Hi!
Lil_B, I got to give Gildie a gift :3
Bloody TF2 was littered with ponies and stuff, so I was like "dafuq" watched it, loved it
Ponies47: I only live 2 hours away from manchester but stll couldn't go
05when did the last ep of season 1 air?
/me hugs Lil_B
Lil_B: any souvenirs from GalaCon?
next year will be at least 20% cooler
I'm gonna do my best to help that happen
Wrek: Around the samish time S2 ended only a year earlier
I kind of hope I can make it next year. I would love to meet some of you guys :3
Ponies47 it should be awesome
05then i became a brony not long after season 1 ended
Ponies47: I'll try not to bring any waepons with me, might scare you ',..,'
Wrek: May 6, 2011.
Wrek, ye basterd, stop playing Dreamtale... I'm getting all hyped
I became a brony in early April.
I can't ponify the microsoft icon :(
05ok so a bit over a month after season 1 ended
killerpony7733 tf2 just updated so we stoped playing just letting you know
Chrysalis... not sure if we met?
i started watching MLP in mid febuary of 2012
Wrek: How long have you been around Bronystate?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Awww,
Lil_B: You will, and I will see you at the airport when you land. :)
I became a brony on Septemeber 22nd 2012 (the day A Friend in Deed aired) :P
05since october iirc
05no wait
05earlier
Wished I had watched the show sooner.....
Wrek: No, much earlier
*I mean Febuary
CCCP: started before Derpy episode
05end of july
Like December or Jan
Thought so, you were around the time I joined
Kakumy oh
MadSurge my first and only Brony Shirt (RD as Nyan Cat) the nice looking GalaCon Journal and Autogramms from german Twilight and swedish Spitfire and met some nice guys (one of them ordered 15 crates of Blindbags... he now has the Blindback monopol for MLP in germany... really)
05also Pony_Zen
Wrek : how did you become a Brony?
05NEVER
05dreamtale is awesome T~T
i wonder who was the first person to ping me...
/me hugs CCCP back... hard because it was so late :(
I became a Brony around this time last year, or more accurately around the end of July... Then I started harassing the Fandom around November anonymously, became Zen around December
CCCP: Me. I did
Wrek, IKR?
and then LoL is perming live maintenance
Wrek, J. Aho never should have left
Wow, it will almost be 2 years since I became brony
Serenity really? (like i honestly dont remember)
performing*
CCCP: It was probably me, or some other reggie
Really?
Lil_B its oaky :)
05Maid_RainBow: long story
:D
yep
World of Tanks anypony?
so it means you can play
Long story short, Maid_RainBow, Wrek watched ponies, and became brony
/me puts Wrek in a viking maid outfit
but probably lag and disconnects everywhere
lol
Great.

Chrysalis: Are you trying to draw attention to us? :p
wait Sumica did ya ever do the expansions for gta4?
:P

Wrek: are there plans to host buck and EFNW at different weekends next year? so people dont have to choose?
Serenity ikr, im saving up to get one commissioned
Chrysalis: Pffft, sod that. Go and get a loan. XD
Chrysalis: oooh, I saw him then!
GilDash|Gaming is it bad... i did for this years...
But, I can snuggle with my M60

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Huffington Post Interview Tonight!

GilDash|Gaming: Except getting shown on a livestream with BS watching and some at everfree
GilDash|Gaming, at least you were ON STREAM
Wrek mind if i link the photo of you on panel
Oh, yeah... the stream... *ahem*

I am the one who avoided every single cam somehow :P
Pony_Zen there arnt that many of me either :P
Yeah, I would of probably avoided every camera
I seriously can't afford to be camerad
Chrysalis, read -at all-
theres probably one with you in it
05Chrysalis link it to meeh

Serenity: i know what you mean. me and my profile are sworn enemies
05so far i have yet to see any image at all of myselg
05f

My dad is sworn enemies with bronies
Pony_Zen, Chrysalis: Have all 3 of us managed to mostly avoid the cameras? XD

http://i.imgur.com/g0idZ.jpg
00,10that is one dapper looking spiderman
Serenity: assassins should be in the yellow pages
alexxm: He's a goon
That right there
Hey Guys... whats up
is your lord and master
Wrek
Goons hate fucktards.
Unfortunately, 80% of the brony population is full of fucktards
YourLittleDashie : hi
Sumica: like a boss
08,01so, did anyone here about the fire?
GilDash|Gaming, It seems so, I saw you in one of the party pics though, just faintly
Who want's some D'aww with their awesome Heavy drawing?
08,01BronyCon had a fire, but we wanted to outdo them
i heard a guy got kicked out
but not a fire
08,01we were so awesome that we cause one of the buildings *across the road* to catch fire
GilDash|Gaming, before you ask, nothing to do with me!
Chrysalis: There was an electrical short, which started a small fire
lol
Pony_Zen: Yeah, but that's okay because there's so many people it'll be hard to say who. :p
08,01Dark_Horst: there was a small fire at bronycon
08,01there was a larger fire in a building across the road from BUCK
that automatically makes us better than BronyCon
Serenity: come to Ponygoons then, it's full of refugees from SA and they're all nice people :D
MadSurge: Already signed up :P
Been signed for months
08,01Chrysalis: i have heard so many people say that BUCK was better than BronyCon
when exactly was bronycon? i'm starting to get confused
I just entered the bronycon chat as the fire started
08,01BronyCon was in July, i think
Last month
GalaCon guys also have admitted BUCK taking the lead
some
*
00,10wow, nice gala pinkie cosplay
08,01we're working closely with Galacon for next year

Wrek: Is that you, looking very MLG there?
Spectrum_Rush: oi

Serenity: yep!
05Serenity: yes that is me
let'S sing!
we just dont know what went wrong
Serenity http://i.imgur.com/xogPE.jpg
theres a better shot
Well, other than his face, I pretty much knew who Wrek was
:3
/me is totally not a stalker.
seems legit
o hai alexxm
I kinda thought wrek had a little longer hair but else i kinda guessed wrek would look like that
how you doing Pony_Zen
AWESOME
killerpony7733 i would agree longer hair, but i expected wrek to look more... viking
Serenity: I recognized him from his OC pony :D
Right, attention returns, what's being drawn? :3
Well, mane colour and hair colour are slightly different
Chrysalis: Hey you should see me and you would be surprised how unviking i look for a dane
Pirates
oh wow
MadSurge i never thought of comparing him to his OC
just wow
Peh, we all have our physical weaknessess
Mine is simply size, I'm 5"3' and 15 years old. I'm a midget
Serenity and Chrysalis: hairdo and glasses match :D
05Chrysalis: ill tyr to grow a proper beard until next time
Serenity: I'm 4 years older than you and I'm 5'4. :P
05no promises
Lol, awesome
Meanwhile: Are you the same generation as me?
Meanwhile, but you have a moustache... you have no weakness
18 and 5"4.
Wrek: know that feeling, stupid facial hair
Wrek: Haha i got a light ish beard so meh, :D
i had a beard on sunday
Yeah, what Pony_Zen said, you can't beat a moustache
Serenity: probably not going by the "4 years older than you" part.
but that was due to forgotten shaver :P
^
hello Meanwhile! :3
same
Allo MadSurge.

MaxTheBrony: why you so surprised, youseem to be a pretty talented artist yourself
Hello everypony. I see Wrek is drawing today.
Who's he drawing?
this right here
is so true https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/7/29/mILUmlZx-0aENf5PzsCctw2.jpg
Canadian_Brony: Hi! Pirate Rarity.
Canadian_Brony hes finishing Pirate Rarity
Spectrum_Rush i appriciate your words but i dont see my self as talented :s
Oh . . . for some reason I thought Rarity had green eyes.
-_(\
:p
MaxTheBrony: I know one thing. You're a better artist than I am.:)
MaxTheBrony, do you want to be talented?
MaxTheBrony: you do art? got a gallery link?
I wish i was talented :p would make drawing so much easier.
defenitely better than what I can draw
MaxTheBrony: the only thing i see wrong with your art is the sevwere lack of ponies
MaxTheBrony: Hey, don't shoot your foot about drawing skills, you're not that bad
MaxTheBrony: You're kidding, right? You're an amazing artist!:O
not talented he say...
:) Thanks guys
MaxTheBrony: I love that RD Wallpaper you did. Would you mind doing one of Twi :$
Serenity defenitely don't shoot your foot! I did with a paintbal . . .
oh hai Canadian_brony
MaxTheBrony, don't say that you cannot have talent
with that you're pretty much what an artist should be
lowfn sad Twi?
Chrysalis: that picture could also sum up me, except as well as MW3, there would be about 5 other games in each frame.
MaxTheBrony: Happy.
We postin' dA links? :3
the idea is still the same though
i play far less games in general
now i have ponies to watch
lowfn i can try :) but that will have to wait abit , got alot in school :)
MaxTheBrony: Okay. :)
I don't play many games because my computer won't run them.
Merri: you are welcome to post yours :)
but ponies are fine
ninja'd ;)
Canadian_Brony: Pah, paintballs are so mediocore.
It's all about shotguns now
Serenity still hurt like hell.
http://fav.me/d5c1boi dammit CosmicUnicorn
You get used to it
y u so good
my art is all traditional, i don't use computer programs :P so mine looks quite a bit worse than most people's, seeing as it's all done by hand
Haha Merri your comic about the Book xD
:3
BronyInstrumental, for me just because you're doing it by hands makes you a better artist than most people here
Alright, I'm off for tonight

CrimsonPhoenix i agreed with what you said about doing drawings by hand .. cause on the computer i can just Ctrl z and remove any errors on papper you dont get that many chanes
Agree*
MaxTheBrony, exactly
Serenity http://files-cdn.formspring.me/photos/20120123/n4f1e259fac26f.jpg
MaxTheBrony: On paper, don't you just DRAW SO MANY CIRCLES

Canadian_Brony: Aww, you're too kind
then should i link my DA?
Yeah do it
Im left handed so i found that Art on computer is less hard for me
Cause on paper all i do is smudge everything with my hand
MaxTheBrony: Same here.
MaxTheBrony: I'm a lefty
Left handed people unite!
Left hand?

Boltasar: Night!
No no, I was talking to MaxTheBrony
:)
tSparx: Sorry.:$
AJIsAwesome: I appreciate your enthusiasm ;)
MadSurge: Now that you think about it, I do too!:D
Thanks!
CANNOT UNHEAR!!!
So who's on stream?
tSparx Wrek
tSparx: Wrek.
Hallo nameless pony!
tSparx Wrek is drawing Pirate Rarity
Back. Mah SPAHGETTI is ready yet :/
pirates and ponies somebody fund it
*isn't
done
Well that's the coolest thing to happen so far today. One of the many reasons I love ponies and bronies: they always put me in a good mood :)
I already threw $20 at my screen
Canadian_Brony: I already threw my life savings at the screen.:D
Canadian_Brony annoyingly i had the chance to throw actual money at wrek
but the cash machines were all empty :(
i'm not old enough to have a credit card, so cash machines are obsolete to me :(
BronyInstrumental your old enough for debhit
There's a minimum age on credit cards? Huh.
Chrysalis: i'm too LAZY for a debit cart
I wanna go to a Brony convention or meet-up or something like that.
I always liked debit cards more than credit cards anyway.
i had my debit card at your age
credit cards are a TERRIBLE idea
Debit is better than credit IMO
Canadian_Brony: Me too me too! I've never been!
no chance of debt
i'm too lazy for either
Canadian_Brony: Same here. There's one near me on Friday but I don't think I can go.
Chrysalis: I don't think CC's are evil, just need to be careful with them. I don't have one.
there is no advantage of a CC that an overdraft doesnt match
my parent's don't trust me with anything anymore, so i'm not gonna put a debit card by them :/
parents*
BronyInstrumental a debit card is fine though, if there isnt enough money
the transaction is declined
rather than getting charged for borrowing
AJIsAwesome I have to wait 2 years until I can drive. And I don't mean get my L license, because that isn't driving. That is controlling a car with your parent in shotgun hoping you don't kill them.
Chrysalis: ik, but they still don't trust me
/me Hugs BronyInstrumental "I'm sorry to hear that" :(
AJIsAwesome driving is when you get atleast your N, 'cause then you can drive alone.
BronyInstrumental: Parents are weird, eh?
or with 2 friends
they think i'll waste all the cash on ponies. "waste", peh, whadda they know?
OH YOU CRAZY CANADIANS WITH YOUR LETTERED LICENSES
BronyInstrumental quite alot
theyv done it all before
Chrysalis: well, my dad didn't do it right. he's homophobic and racist and just plain discriminatory.
Canadian_Brony: Not to make you feel bad, but I already have my license so I can drive. However, I have a lot of things to do concerning college. I REALLY want to go to this meetup before heading off to college.
brb
05cona continue on this later
tSparx I can get my L (Learners) license when I'm 16, then I can get my N (Novice) after 1 year with my L. To get my full license, I need to drive for 2 years with my N.
05but for now
05gona let shizu take over the stream
05hope you enjoyed :3
wut two beta community access
Thank you Wrek for the always awesome stream.
oooh shizustream
time for a show
Wrek: Take your time, dude. We dont mind.:)
oh right i got the badge a few days ago
thanks for the stream and the music Wrek
AJIsAwesome then go! I have 1 week before school and I'm making the most of it!
Thanks for the stream Wrek
Origato, Wrek-san!
I'm certain my college won't have any bronies......:(
Canadian_Brony: Thanks.:)
AJIsAwesome: It's *college,* what the hell do you mean there won't be bronies? That's where most bronies are!
AJIsAwesome: I'm sure there'll be at least one :)
tSparx: Not the college I'm going to.
tSparx: Thanks.:)
I'm hoping for the best.
I feel for you guys going to college in the US. We don't have to stay on campus at all for college, but apparantely you guys have to stay for atleast your first year.
ouch
AJIsAwesome: If there aren't any bronies at your college, I'm gonna refer to it as "Dumby-Dumb Stupidy University"
Canadian_Brony: Yep. Sucks.
tSparx: :D
Canadian_Brony: It depends on what college, but that's the norm. At my college, I have to stay on for 2 years.
I'm going to University anyway. It's the only school near me with a Mechanics wing.
Or live at home, if your home happens to be within X miles of my school.
Hi
tSparx: I live a hour and a half away from my college.

11,01Hi MaidSurge (sorry for the late Hi.)
Shizuka the chat or stream?
kirzstryfe That's not Meanwhile. Where is the mass amount of tea?
Shizuka:unless we dont refresh?
13yes unless you don't refresh
13ponychat is a separate service, but if you rely on our site client to chat, don't refresh
k
can people create a client and connect it to the chat?
There's no reason why not!
Sounds complicated though O.o

if so i dont know how so ill stick with this
13irc is not hard...
You can download a client and use it to connect to ponychat sonicandmario85. Etc, mIRC.

WB name
Shizuka so when should the site be back up then
pop-out? WHY THE FUCK DIDNT I THINK ABOUT THAT BEFORE
Shizuka: Sure, but I imagine programming your own client would be. From scratch that is.
i preffer fighting normally in oblivion
13don't know how long it will take them to upgrade the DB
13hopefully not long
13certainly not forever

13no more youtubes please, we're about to go live
k
finally relented and got a new battery for the mower after my tinkering with the blades didnt work - if a new battery doesnt work, Im going to have to take the tractor to a repair shop - I'll put the battery in later - too hot outside
:O
Shizuka:also firefox is using alot of MB on here and it lags the video a bit so i have to pause it for it to stop and play it again
yay
Shizuka:if i use another browser will it stop?
13that's because firefox has become horribly bloated
13better than IE
found some blue set blind bags while at Walmart for the battery - got 6 of them
maybe mozilla will fix it sometime
Firefox memorly leaks like fuck
I recently read Cheerilee's Garden... I somewhat regret it
Chrome is on the top step
it used to not use up so much MB
I am back! From god knows where.
sonicandmario85: That would require a major overhaul in how FF wants to evolve right now.
sonicandmario85: Still doesn't, but something screws up, and it memory leaks the living shit out your PC
hi Sabershy|Cleaning. Would you like a slice of pizza? It finally arrived
11,01Going live Shizuka
Sabershy|Cleaning: Welcome back!:)
WUBBA DUB DUB MOTHER*SQUEEE*
STREAM!!
Ohai stream
is gone live
sonicandmario85: I mean, I still use FF, but I'm not sure that problem is likely to fix. Fortunately, this is really the only thing that needs much memory on a regular basis.
I ask my self why do I read the Grimdark fics when I know I'm getting my self into crap?
ill go download chrome
hai stream :)
and ill return
Who's streaming?
Chrome pony is best pony
1 - clear silverish Twilight Velvet
Canadian_Brony: I would love it. Too bad I am on a diet. :\
I beleive it's Shizuka. I don't recognise the OC
MASF123 either Shizuka or Nittany_Discord, but I think it's Shizuka
I see 2 OCs
That's roseluck in the right ._.
Serenity the left one is Nitt, the right is Shizu
the one on the right isnt an OC :P
IIRX
*C
I never played Baldurs gate
AW YEAH
The one on the right is roseluck methinks
13it's roseluck
oh
AW FREAKING YEAH
See >:3
2 - purple metallic Amethyst Star
aww yeah
Roseluck = Shizuka's favorite side charactar :3
I have no sound from stream.
aww cute kittens
13i love sarevok's laugh
Shizuka: I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU! :l
Is there any sound?
What laugh?
Guys, it's being sorted
I hear nothing
11,01Shizuka doesn't have a desktop pony yet.
Shizuka sound isn't getting through
13nittany check sound?
i cant hear anything
Nittany_Discord no sound lad :P
SpadeMagnes[R]: You can't hear it, but in the cinematic he has an awesome laugh.
I am painis cupcake
Nittany_Discord: not a finished one atleast
theres no sound
Dead
dat blood
:O
This game was my junior high.
The power of catsup/
I have always been a geek, true ;)
I shall fill the sound quota with cartoon sound effects
Or not
there we go
w00t!
:O
13sound now?
05wee baldurs gate
this should be good
you're playing the BEST game ever?
Eeyup
holy crap I was watching a youtube video and this started
I see a Shizu :3
13let's see that again with sound :3
hmm new game for me
boy am I happy I kept this on.
The chances of me getting anything done this afternoon just went to zero
is this like ff1
i heard the theme and I was like "oh god when did I turn bladurs gate on?"
11,01Sound.
name: It's a computer game based on a D&D universe
what class are you going for?
oh
Wrek: Asked teice already, hoping three times a charm: Have you played Darksiders II yet? :P Sorry if you've already answered, but I must know.
13when it comes to dnd i usually go rogues that can tank
ooh hes dead
shit just got real
13so primarily rogue but with plenty of combat
shizuka do you have tutu?
oh yes he can
dat voice acting
13also... you hear sarevok get a running start to bash the door... but when you see him there's like three feet
13where did he run from X3
05dont like darksiders
obviously he ran up the stairs
i like darksiders
05plus im a PC gamer master race
13ded
ow
Wrek: It IS on PC
is this going to be through tutu? Tutu is best mod
05yapyapyap
13yes tutu
played the first game sort of god of war ish like
05Serenity: its a port
well that was a short game
Tomato sauce!
short game for him
13the end
well its better than falling to your death :P
not every bhallspawn can be so lucky
im an adept in all gaming systems
though to be honest this game isn't as good a story as planescape torment
Someone explain Tutu to me, because back in the day I never messed with mods.
So was Skyrim, but you don't complain ;)
13Baldur's Gate Tutu is a mod that runs BG1 on BG2's engine
Tutu takes baldurs gate 1 and uses all the neat stuff in BG2.
Ooooohhhh, me like!
13and adds BG2's magic and mechanics
Serenity GASP!
05skyrim is able to mod away that
13seeing if val is able to multiplayer
so basically you can jump from 1 to 2 without having to reclass or anything
I can multiplay!
3 - crystal Pinkie Pie - 4 - Metallic Applejack - 5- Twilight Sky (clear stallion) - 6 - another stallion Mosely Orange - nice results in the blue blind bag set :)
i shall be out
seeya MASF123
if only skyrim was multiplayer
do you have game ranger shizuka?
MASF123: bYE!
goodbye MASF123
bye MASF124
saiyonara desu, MASF123
hello there
Skyrim wouldn't work as Multiplayer
who is the vein pony in the bottom left?
13nope
name I am sure a mod will come out around the time TES Online comes out.
13aww yeah i forgot i rolled DEX 17
bye masf
The way the whole came works, it's designed for singleplayer
Athgaar Nitt IIRC
but i play on ps3
13i'm a little dense though... INT 10
Gameranger is the fastest way to host bg games i've found. without crazy port magic and stuff.
11,01Vein pony?
see you Canadian_Brony. AJIsAwesome, thelonepony, tSparx
also you know theres a baldurs gate pony mod right?
"little dense" >.>
:3
red and blue branching lines
kirzstryfe: Hi :3
WHA
Nittany_Discord: The hairstyle.
Oh course, of course he does, kirzstryfe
13well the rule of thumb is below 9 you are incapable of whatever that stat controls
05skyrim works jsut fine as multiplayer
TheMaster: BG pony?!
05the skyrim online mod pr oves it
well then do we get to loot each other
yes there is a baldurs gate pony mod. let me find it
13so like INT 9 and below means you can't talk right
There's an online mod? :U
05as for TES online
05why would i want anotehr button masher MMO
what is this?
baldur's gate
http://saber-scorpion.com/gaming/mods_mlp.php
11,01I think IRL, I have an INT of 18, but CHA of 9.
05id rather have a multiplayer TES with coop osomething
Baldur's Gate
oh...
18 int is rare
Question guys: What can you do to get a better signal reception from your wireless router?
05becasue skyrim online is a mod
and baldurs gate already has multiplayer. its just not easy to play it online because of ports
05the game wasnt made with it in mind
13hey look, phil and lil as BG characters
05so theres a lot of broken shit to deal with
no if you die do we get to loot each others if you die
05we dont want another MMO
...
Get a less whiny voice
Shizuka why not use the baldurs gate ponymod?
11,01I assigned my stat points to intelligence and forgot to balance before God kicked me out of the Life start screen XD
get the one that sounds most like a pony
Yeah, I think GW2, WoW, YTOR, Rift, Aion and some others are enough
I get soooooooo picky with character creation.
ooh vget the irish voice
TheMaster: Is it just human!Ponies?
i just watched braveheart BTW
me too Canadian_Brony
failing that, scream guy
13hm
well you can't make the sprites ponies
Well hello TheMaster
13will go with the more noble one
Shizuka: Choosethe silliest one
oh its you
hi TheDoctor
13i miss my cold killer voice set in NWN though
13i love that so much
http://saber-scorpion.com/gaming/mods_mlp.php check it out though.
Hi Canadian_Brony
I need to hunt my neighbor down - I loaned my skyrim to him, he's been playing for over a month, still hasnt beaten the game yet - he's trying to do everything before returning it
its got the voices, character sets and pictures.
so as far as a mod its not a big deal
Cypresswolf wrapping a game like Skyrim doesn't sound like an easy task
im half way done moost of the side quest
Cypresswolf: Loaning Skyrim sounds like a dangerous proposition.
Cypresswolf: Want to borrow my supershotgun?
who names a coast "sword"
It's the Sword Coast
:O
Hi everypony
hi CrazyHippie1234
took me about 3 months to do a majority of the things in the game
hey CrazyHippie1234
Ghost coast?
Named because it's all dangerous and stuff.
13Athgaar: The Sword Coast, so named because of the bandits and adventuring and whatnot
because the coastline is apparently dangerous and hard to sail down
Call it the death coast
yes
Or fluffy kitten coast
13the only problem i have with tutu is it doesn't keep the background music during these bits
Well Hi Canadian_Brony and slinky
11,01Text seems hard to read. Should I go fullscreen?
so what party are you going for Shizuka?
i havent gone that far
What are we watching?
13well imoen is always my sidekick, minsc too
Nittany_Discord: Yes, please.
i havent discovered alll of them
Serenity: no, that wont be necessary - I know where he lives :)
Minsc is a requirement
13usually i keep khalid and jaheira for the last two
Cypresswolf: Aww.
i finished halfway of the one i discovered
also Grey Delise
CrazyHippie1234 Shizuka and Nittany_Discord are playing Baldur's Gate IIRC
13i've only ever finished once
oh you're both playing together?
Buy NOTHING
11,01Only thing about going fullscreen: I don't have FMLE set properly for it, so stream quality may drop.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Gorion sounds like a dick
spam
dat spam
Nice.
Gorion is bestfosterfather
Let Shizuka play the game
11,01Mind if I try fullscreen Shizuka?
13can try
my first kick and spam
INB4 first ban
SpadeMagnes[R]: No he's the best
13hopefully livestream isn't compressing it all out, the text is pretty small and i'm already fullscreened
Hey
man, it'd be neat to set up a full party of multiplayers
:(
also it looks like your framrate is very, very low
by how slow your sprite walked
name: (;
TheMaster: The game runs at 20-30 FPS I beleive
13buh... it kept my stuff!
you can set it to what you want though
:P
princedarri: :P
13(you can tell i haven't come back to this in a very very long time)
don't forget to get the golden pantaloons
Shizuka: Yes
hello
13i think i had minsc hang onto the pantaloons..
without the golden pantaloons the game is meaningless
derp_derp: Howdy!
you know what happens if you keep them right?
11,01Livestream is compressing it out.
hi derp_derp
Has anyone here played A Bard's Tale for ps2 or xbox?
wut?
13hm
if you import your baldurs gate 1 character into bg2 you can keep the golden pantaloons
What's it about?
how you doing derp_derp
Wait, there's actually a reason to keep hold of those?
13dual monitors will make this...
where do i need to go to download adblock?
13hmm..
yes. because in bg2 you can aquire...the silver pantaloons!
on chrome
Shizuka dual-monitor is SO USEFUL!!
Wish my laptop would get fixed
and if you import your bg2 character into throne of bhall.
im using it right now
you can get bronze underpants.
13yeah but it's breaking mouse scrolling
which combine into. a giant robot suit of armor
Hahaha
sonicandmario85: google
:P
which is the best armor in the game
13SO MUCH SINGING
Oh that's awesome! I did not know that xD
also why does it lag when i chat..
its the ultimate old save bonus
Shut up!
My ears bleed
sonicandmario85: Because your computer is most likely terrible
D=
sonicandmario85: Streaming's tough on the server and on your comp.
:[ MOAR BUTTER
listen to what they're saying. its important
11,01This is a pre-EA Bioware game IIRC.
Even shitbox can run Chrome
13i know
in a game or two
11,01Just saying, not starting.
why do i har allah
this is one of the best d&d based games ever made
13the wise alaundo can go eat a cow
though planescape is the better story
in the same genre as this game - you play a bard that gets roped into a mission to save this princess and there are several multiple choice quests bringing a different end depending on your choices in most missions
i heard a guy same allah
Shizuka: Poor crow
Fucking shut up!
say*
Planescape <3 infinite love from me.
13i am protected from
13EEEEEEEVIIIIIIIL
SHUUUT UUUUP!
No no, he's talking about Alaundo
though they don't make for very good streaming games.
Name
/me pokes Shizuka
im evil
13gah
You know what we nee dto stream?
Magika
13oh i see the problem
/me blinks
for that matter these games are tough to play multiplayer
wish I still had that game...ended up selling that and several other ps2 games for game cube
13there we go
because everyone runs off and does there own thing
SpadeMagnes[R] Phase4 has done that befoer I think.
13i like that the tutorial is split up into all those guys standing around
Cypresswolf: No regrets, the cube is a good console
bad trade off now that I think about it
We definatly need to stream the pumpkin game
Shizuka: 'Show I remember it
most were good games
Shizuka the best kind amiright?
so shizuka. did you only beat baldurs gate 1?
13yeah
Bg2 is even better you know
13BG2 i stopped at like chapter 4 i think
Shizuka: You can skip straight past this stuff I think, though.
blasphemy. thats only the underdark
13neat... crashed
Game Cube did let me play Twilight Princess & Animal Crossing :)
TheMaster: It's also a LOT harder, haha. Took me a long time to beat it.
i had no real issue until really the final boss in throne of bhall
I was wondering why my stream froze
great
she's one of the hardest bosses i've ever faced.
13well in that case i'm jumping forward to my save..
irenicus went down easy to me. but then again I knew where all the hidden loot is
bing
TheMaster: I never claimed to be great at this game. I'm really, really bad at it actually, haha. I just really enjoy it :)
its awesome. i've beat the game 3-4 times
11,01Fuck you Windows
wish I had people to multi with.
13iiiiiiii forget what i was doing at this point....
Nittany_Discord:im using xp i dont get those errors
test
Shizuka: you were talking about how BG2 stopped at Chapter 2 or something :P
11,01XP isn't as good for streaming as 7.
the key to beating irenicus is getting the best gear.
11,01In fact, I've never seen that error before.
gaddam keyboard
and having the right party.
13oh
Keldorn + carsomyr=instant destruction
Just once, I'd like to play my games without Windows crashing - JUST! ONCE! :|
..
and if you can get a mage the staff of the magi, robe of vecna and ring of gaxx you're also basically the god of magic
:[ MOAR BY
BUTTER
lol skydoesminecraft refrence
XD
what's on stream?
That error is annoying
sorry, I will contain my nerding out of baldurs gate
The chat derped about 20 minutes ago and I just nocticed O_O
been contemplating getting a Mac, but some games arent availabe for mac :(
Its best to keep your theme in basic to avoid it
target and walmart each have a different set of blindbags... >.<
hello every one
Also Basic helps with performance
hello cow334
..
cow334: Hi!
and I cant afford a $1000+ new computer right now
this chat needs butter....dododododo *starts throwing butter everywhere* oh yeah butter......dodododo
baldurs gate 1,2 and planescape torment are actually all on gog for 10 dollars each.
Nittany_Discord probably better than Vista. This thing is a RAM hog. XP runs TF2 with only 2GB of RAM, but Vista won't with 3GB
I should upgrade to 64-bit and get more RAM
this is a different game.
/me waves at every one
hi cow334
13of COURSE i've been waylaid by enemies and must defend myself!
did you travel through time Shizuka?
Random encounter?
im seeing smexy time from here in my tv
woah
so much chat lag
11,01If that message comes up again, I'll switch schemes.
Oh Minsc. you are best party member
also if i dont type very fast its because i have to take a shit and im holding it in because it hurts but im gonna have to go sometime DX
11,01I just killed a few non-essential to streaming programs.
random mode activate
so Nittany you're playing?
13i am
name: Chairmode activate
11,01No. Shizuka is.
Oh. but you were level one hanging out in candlekeep
how did you teleport?
13loaded save
ah
13cause it crashed on combat
String_Shredder: boop
so you went the canon party group eh?

I prefer to grab the ranger west of bereghost
he's pretty l33t
superioir numbers just do it
Night everypony

Night Serenity
Night Serenity :)

why did you kill Viconia?
We're lagging behind, Shiz, don't spoil it!
ok
11,01K.
unless you don't have the game, but then you wouldn't really need the mod then now would you :P
name: Just giving a warning.
oh you killed the guard
good.
13hm
do you like barrrels
Should pick viconia up but you don't have any room in your party
13i can't drop any of the other four or their buddy will run away
you can always grab viconia in bg2
13and theeeeeen ARROWS IN THE BACK
13no
pick her up
13oh there is a road
Viconia was voiced by grey delise. better known as azula
NUH-UH!
Crazy-awesome world!
lo pony people
follow the yellow bricked road
IshPonyPony: Hi!:)
lo IshPonyPony

13where's this yelling guy
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Know Your Mare: The Great and Powerful Trixie!
Hey IshPonyPony
Hi everypony
hi every1
Dashee: Hi!
how you doing IshBestPony and Dashee
hi Dashee
linx: Hi:)
hi Dashee
hi IshBestPony
Hallo Dashee
...
hai Dashee
in bg1 especially mages are best used for their debuffs and buffs
How are you all tonight?
TheMaster: And their badassness!
hello Dashee
Hey, what's u-HOLY SHIT BALDUR'S GATE
its almost a garuntee victory if you can get off a mass confusion, slow or other spell
well yes. In bg2 it becomes a whole other game between opposing mages. spells and counter spells
hi SirGanjalf. Eeyup
and most encounters in bg2 involve an enemy mage
how can you beat a mage
nyahahaha
Cool story, bros
...magic
nyahahahaha
;P
so he kicked him in the head till he was dead. nhahaha
kill em
only magic can defeat magic
also arrows
MAGIC MUST DEFEAT MAGIC
woot woot
EXPECTRO PATRONUS
basically in bg2 you're screwed if you don't shut a enemy mage down
bad things will happen to you very quickly
:3 very random today
"Basically in BG2 you're screwed" -- my playing experience :3
kick the *squee* ack to oblivion
what did you pick as your main character?
oops wrong game
/me glomps Nittany_Discord
I've finished BG with Xan & Branwen, istead with Minsc & Dynaheir. Yes, i'm weird:P
tSparx it helps to play baldurs gate 1 so you can get a good feel for your playing style
xan?
hai Bronysith
how did you put up with his emoness?
hi Bronysith
brb
/me licks name and Canadian_Brony
TheMaster: That Elf Mage with his fancy sword
/me was licked
/me 11,01hugs Bronysith
I know who xan is
TheMaster: Oh I beat the hell out of that game! Took me a while, but I got through it!
/me eats Bronysiths arm
did you import your character from bg1 into bg2?
taste like shicken
chicken*
TheMaster: Yes, i did
Excellent. with the golden pantaloons right?
TheMaster: of course
TheMaster: Yeah. I remember I had a guy named Zeth, but nothing about his class.
TheMaster: I do love Rangers for D&D, but who knows what I went with
tSparx what do you want
Mages are the way to go in my opinion. if you can survive long enough you become basically a god
though Edwin is always fun as a party member
name Oi?
stop pinging me
I'm not attempting to ping you :/
my ears hurt i have ear phones on
its because your setname is very pingable. you should probably change it.
name it's because of your name. I suggest you change it if you don't want to be overloaded with pings
aww i gtg bai
Oh is it because I keep using the word name? Hahahahahaha
seeya name
bye name!
13there it is
In sequel i've had Imoen, Jaheira, Minsc, Jan Jansen and Aerie. Then, in ToB i've exchanged Aerie to Sarevok.
Where what is?
13the golden pantaloons
oh
who did you romance?
TheMaster: Edwin is a must if you have an evil team
TheMaster: Jaheira
11,01Can't wait for Shizuka to find the whatever cursed belt.
/me picks up a book and starts reading
TheMaster: But some glitch occured and i've never finished this quest, though:(
/me puts Nittany_Discord in a ninja maid corset
God damn it computer stop buffering the stream
G'night everypony! :)
My latest final party was Keldorn, Viconia, Imoen (I can't will myself to abandon her). Minsc, Anomen
I hate my computer so much....
13oh the belt that reverses your PC gender
^Give to Edwin
Night GilDash
11,01Shizuka: Yep.
and I replaced Minsc with Sarveok in TOB. I hated to do that but minsc just couldn't keep up
g'night GilDash
if he's in your team, ofc
11,01And it's cursed, so you can't remove it unless you go pay to have it remove.
13yup
11,01*removed
BTW: Yoshimitsu - never forget:(
Keldorn with Carsomyr is neigh unstoppable
*Yoshimo
especially when you upgrade Carsomyr too +6
Yoshimitsu's from Tekken:$
Nittany_Discord how is that useful?
its hilarious
Discord (Mage, CE), Nightmare Moon (Warrior, NE), Trixie (Mage, CN), and that griffon girl (Ranger, CN) would be a fun evil party
11,01It's not. It's a cursed item.
tSparx: Nah, Dicord is Chaotic Neutral
Nightmare moon would be a mage too
11,01BG has bad items, but you won't know they're bad until you equip them.
*Discord
Nittany_Discord Oh! That makes sense
Well however you wanna put it. Those cats are often vague anyway.
dat line
11,01As far as the r63 belt, you don't know you have it until you equip it.
I prefer the Viconia romance myself. But thats because I fanboy over greydelice
Aerie is whiney and Jaheria is glitchy
Canadian_Brony Nittany_Discord You can use it to evade guards. If you're being looked for by a group of people, and then switch gender on them, they won't know who to look for
evade peeps*
I am going to bed now goodnight guys <3
Nittany_Discord: what about the maid wand you casted on me?
Night!
g'night
seeya MLP_Brovakiin
11,01tSparx: That would be an interesting mechanic.
11,01Bronysith: What maid wand?
Nittany_Discord: you waved a maid wand over my oc
Nittany_Discord: But because it's so hard to remove, it's not easy to use all the time.
and he became a maid
11,01Bronysith: I don't have a maid wand.
It's 5:14pm in my slice of the globe, and people have been saying g'night all afternoon. I love the Internet.
tSparx hah, 3:15pm
tSparx well its 2316 in this slice
A Briton, Chrysalis ?
Yup
:)
23:16 here to
tSparx: Same here.
11,01You're talking about that pic Bronysith?
Nittany_Discord: yes, the pic you drew of my oc in a maid outfit
None of you Brits happen to know how Sky fared in the Tour of Britain stage today, do you?
13i love that we're all leveling up from killing little worgs
Yeah I didn't think so :P
nope sorry tSparx
nope
hello ppl
*sigh*, it's a truth I had to learn doubly hard here in the States: no one but me cares about cycling, haha
iv been too busy recovering from BUCK

05i can safely say
05that buck was my gala
05best
05night
05ever
Chrysalis It was in Manchester right?
Dashee yup
11,01My depression has prevented me from waving the maid wand some more.
Wrek: orly? any hot mares or stallions there?
05both
Nittany_Discord: Whats wrong?
Chrysalis Too far for me :(
Wrek IKR, that 12yo said it best "this weekend has been the best one of my life"
wrek good answer haha ;)
05specially melted a bit at this one dashie cosplayer
Dashee wrek came over across the channel
Conventions, meet-ups, collections, everypony's got something to show off except me.
hell i went a couple hundred miles to get there
Chrysalis Need money to travel
not so much nameless pony now am i tSparx? :p
^^das^^
05i went from the far north off sweden to manchester
Er, what Dashee said
05totally worth it
Dashee it was announced in april
plenty of time to save
JakyBoy98: Nope! ;)
13we are so lost
XD
Chrysalis: You have to make money first! Haha
Chrysalis It's hard to save when you can't get a job
job-seekers
anyone seen blacjak lately...or well i guess youd call him scoot-scootaloo?
thats where alot of the money i spent came from
anyone know if there is way to return an order from welovefine?
Chrysalis Save from Â£50 a week, that's still pretty hard to do
Quick_Thinker they have a returns department dont they
05it was the wrong size or?
JakyBoy98 not in a couple days, but I don't see him often anyway.
well my mom wants to return it
Dashee not impossible though
Shizuka: You'll find your way. This area always messes me up too.
yet i dont want to
Hey guys, I need your help. I just got a webkinz punk princess cat and I need a name for it. Help?
05then say no
well ive only seen him on Celestia Radio
Chrysalis I know, Mybe i will go next time :)
Kawaii_icybeauti: Doom Kitteh
she already called customer support and left a voice mail what can i do?
I come back and what game is this?
do it
i think its diablo
tSparx: Hmmm....That's actually a good idea
MadSurge: Baldur's Gate
BUCK II is gonnna be so much bigger
05id ratehr have my kids be bronies than hang around with the standard gorusp of bullies, gangsters, douchebags and drug abusers that exist at the teens
Wrek isnt there an image about that
Quick_Thinker: Is there a reason why she wants it sent back?
Wrek: /)
Kawaii_icybeauti: Anything named after Doom Kitty is a good thing in my book xD
Chrysalis: can't wait! :$
um its this http://www.welovefine.com/2876-twilight-face-hoodie.html
I could name it after Rarity's cat.
aka im boy so yeah :L
Chrysalis: Buck II: BUCK IT!
I will start saving now for BUCK II :)
05Quick_Thinker: i dunno, hope that they explain to her that "hey, whats wrong with it? "i dont want my son to wear such an abomination" "lady, grow up, your son clearly has."
See i dubbed it the BUCKening
Wrek: i agree
Quick_Thinker: :O
Wrek ugh, I know that group all too well. I seem to be the one who gets all the "attention" from them
I want that RD hoodie!!
even before I was a brony
Quick_Thinker: How old are you, if you don't mind my asking?
Quick_Thinker: I don't se the problem. You want to wear something you like. Have you told her you like it?
well she wants me to make friends and other shit (i dont have a lot of high school friends
05makign friends doesnt work liek that
Quick_Thinker: If you want to make friends, just be yourself. YOur true friends will come in time.
even though i dont want half of the people there to be "friends" not the greatest of influiences thet ar
nyahahaha
'Cause if you're 16 or so, I'd say it's time to do every teenager's least favorite thing: actually stand up to your parents.
fuck
Quick_Thinker: Making friends is easy woohoo
i kicked him in the head until he was dead
is this smite
oh and just saying i drew my pony OC on a canvas today XD
tSparx make sure your correct before you do though
I named it opalescence.
and have evidence to back it up
05Quick_Thinker: wish i could be there and help ye
05but sadly
05its a hard thing to do
what is
05then again if you are the purchaser
05only you could theoretically return it
05unless the parental rights cover that stuff etc
CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP
well this also arrived it looks damn cool http://www.welovefine.com/1844-read-a-book.html
05becasue if there's nothign wrong with the shirt
i changed my steam pic
Man those crickets are noisy as hell.
Quick_Thinker: This is a thing worth fighting for. You make friends by being who you are. I never lost any friends worth keeping because I wore purple.
05I WANT THAT BAG
^
well the thing is no one in school knows what the hell a brony is
Quick_Thinker: This may sound dangerous to do, but you must stand up against your parents. You are expressing who you are, and you have the right.
Quick_Thinker: And?
Is this Diablo?
they dont even know what steam is
Canadian_Brony: /)
13okay
13no resting here
13run away time
Quick_Thinker: Well then I think it's time for you to explain what one is.:)
well things kids dont understand they go with the easiest choice be an ass
Quick_Thinker that is always a nightmare. Thankfully for me, one turned 5 into bronies, including me.
i did
TheKoreanBrony1354 /)
ooh gems
and heres what they said GAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYy
Quick_Thinker: Man, you don't have to wear the hoodie all the time at school, haha.
I've always tried to get'em all
dose anypony know what the friday movie is
But you should keep it, wear it when you can.
Enjoy it.
Live it!
also have the wonderbolts hoodie from hot topic
05when it comes to life
and all of the cutie mark shirts
hey i wana ponify my computer some more anyone got some suggestions?
05lookign at highschool as the following
Quick_Thinker: You are in the same boat I was when I was a closet brony. People will make fun of you and they probably won't ever change, but that's because they are being ignorant and judgemental. You can change the social norm at your school. You have the power to do this. Just believe in yourself.
05it will be hell
05people with be fucking idiots
05but live through it
05and everythign will feel so much ebtter
just realise
the main reason those people are assholes
What Wrek said, too.:)
is they have absolutely nothing going for them
I'm an out bisexual male at an all-guys school. I promise you, I got through it, you will too :D
and are too lazy to actually do anything about it
dat dream
Quick_Thinker: its cool man
Only My best friend and my older Bro know i'm a Brony
tSparx: /)
Er, was at an all-guys school, haha. A moment ago...
tSparx: That takes courage, my friend.
wear it with pride Quick_Thinker
Dashee my entire school and closest family know I'm a brony thanks to one person.
and get to a meetup/convention
well im hoping i can find a way to stop welovefine from telling my mom she can return it
13woo cure light ability
youll never feel so proud to be a part of such a wonderful community
Dashee surprisingly, that was not my younger sister
Quick_Thinker: What was your parents' reactions to this item?
Who was it?
tSparx: Nah, when you're bi, you can placate them with talk of Carmen Elektra etc. etc.
*were*
Canadian_Brony who was it?
Er, AJIsAwesome
they "think" im going to get beat up
even though no one gets beat up anymore just mentally abuse now
hey anyone mind giving me the short of what this convo is about?
tSparx: No problem. I make the same mistake.:$
JakyBoy98: Quick_Thinker bought a twilight hoodie and his parents want him to return it.
ah
thanks
the thing i dont get is they are fine with the bag but not the hoodie
they said ITS PURPLE YOUR GOING TO LOOK GAY
Return it and get the Rainbow Dash one :)
Quick_Thinker: Well and even so, you'd get through it, haha. And maybe, as a compromise, you can just agree not to wear it at school for a while.
whats so bad about a hoodie with ears and a horn?
Quick_Thinker: you're*
yeah a compermise might save my ass
Dashee an old friend. I told him over Steam chat I was a brony. The next day, he tells a friend at school who is also a brony I am. A week later, I invite him for dinner and tells my parents and 6-yr-old sister I watch MLP. I never felt my face turn redder.
Quick_Thinker: "Ma, pa, here's the thing: I wait until I've made some friends, and I won't wear the hoodie til then, but I'm not taking it back."
i might just wear it around home and at Canterlot Gardens con
Quick_Thinker: Definitely at Canterlot Gardens.
tSparx you might just have saved my ass
might
/me puts a bananna in Nittany_Discord s ear
Quick_Thinker: I have some experience here. Just stick up for this, and be patient with them, and you'll work it out. I believe in you :)
Quick_Thinker: Don't worry. If you ever need advice, just ask.
your the banana king Nittany_Discord
Chrysalis: You're*
AJIsAwesome: That's what friendship and magic are for!
/me slaps Meanwhile with his own cinderblock
my mum's okay with me being a brony, my dad, not so much
tSparx: Eeyup!:)
Meanwhile: ouch
My family couldn't care if I was a brony.
my parents dont care about what i do/watch :P
/me 11,01is the banana maid king
*that I am*
well since this topic is settle for now anyone wanna play some CS:GO?
Nittany_Discord: the manliest maid, don't forget
Oh right, My older Brother waled in on me while i was on this site, We were watching an episode from Season 2 i think, he just looked at me with a weird look on his face.
linx my parents are totally cool with me being a brony, but I( was surprised when my grandmother talked to me about it.
heres a question which iv never gotten a proper answer for
My parents are the most liberal, laid-back, awesome parents I've ever heard of.
why do you feel the need to tell your parents?
its not like it actually affects them
Chrysalis beats me. After all, I wasn't the one who told them anyway.
Chrysalis: Well because we have a desire to be open to our parents, relate to them, share our interests.
I haven't told my Parents, they wouldn't care much what i watch anyway
Chrysalis: Fuck knows. To tempt the disownment fairy?
But yeah, I'm in Dashee's camp.
tSparx do you share everytime you watch a new tv show?
Chrysalis: ooh thats a simple one, kids need the approvel of there parents... for some mentl reasons
oh yeah and for some note taking and evidence the entire chat about the hoodie is being saved in word to use effectivly
"coming out" as a brony
Spectrum_Rush: their*
No, they don't even know I watch MLP, but that's 'cause it's never come up.
00,03>Coming out
Meanwhile: yeah yeah
00,03eh...
makes it sound like you see being a brony as a negative thing
/me glomps and licks Scoot-Scootaloo s earhole
whos coming out
NONSENSE
hi Scoot-Scootaloo.
Scoot-Scootaloo i couldnt think of a better phrase, hence the quotation marks
/me EWWW DX
Is coming out as gay a negative thing!?
Canadian_Brony: my dad's one of those "its wronge to be gay" dad's.so he dosen't agree with it
Why do people make such a big deal about someone els watching a tv show?
Please please PLEASE don't make a joke about that! I'm tempted enough myself!
Scoot-Scootaloo: :D what did your friends think of you watching ponies?
Chrysalis: You have a point, but if you haven't reassured to your parents what you're doing, they'll be confused and possibly think that you don't want to confide in them and trust them. I don't know.
its ok Quick_Thinker: we dont judge
00,03I mean it's not bad, but to use that term is... I dunno, doesn't sit right with me :S
Dashee: IKR?
00,03Eww, who watches ponies? :|
humm scoot?
Scoot-Scootaloo you can offer an alternative :P
Scoot-Scootaloo I do.
I just shouldn't have to censor myself in front of my parents is all.
Scoot-Scootaloo: I do..........:(
Scoot-Scootaloo: I'd imagine that you do.
Scoot-Scootaloo: WE ALL DO :D
My Brother just says, you're turning into a Brony, then laughs
AJIsAwesome theres my point again, is being a brony that bad it needs to be confided
i do well actually i havent watched them in while hmmmmm MARATHON TIME
/me heres my philosphy... like what you want, give no fucks what others think. simple easy
00,03What hath God wroth when men watch ponies :(
the only reason my parents dont know im a brony is they have never asked
scoot_scootaloo why not call yourself blacjak21 on this then humm? XD
WHAT HAS SCIENCE DONE?!
well that entertained me
i dont hide it
Scoot-Scootaloo: you're funny today :D
Scoot-Scootaloo why do you refuse to let a terrible joke die?

SpadeMagnes[R]: It tells the tale of what woud have been the origin of Nightmare Night, and the catalyst element that forced Celestia to banish Luna. After defeating Discord, Canterlot was witnessing a very slow recovery. Misery could still be found everywhere around, specially for the ponies that had less means.Luna thought that expanding the kingdom and founding a new pony colony elsewhere would give a solution to the problem, allowing the ponies

Dismo: bc it's not specifically stated in the rules that it's against them and he was in another channel and didn't realize the changes would carry over to bronystate channel.
Anyways, excuse me, my brain needs a reboot. You see, I just read pure concentrated stupid and it's damaged my mental harddrive.

This is powerfull...
world domination gone wrong

Wrek: For now
She is Pitt.

too bad we cant watch that episode right now XD

otakon: Totally possible. You see, EA just made another announcement about C&C Generals 2.
A hard drive cannot be repaired, only replaced.

NO poni can oni two poni while pony
Who the shit is this?
CriticKitten: besides them ripping off another series designs?
boxxy!
OH GOD
hey its boxy
lol
O.o

No poni can poni two ponies to poni. It's up to each and every poni to poni that very special someponi for themselves.
WHAT!?
SpadeMagnes[R]: Boxxy.
Who the fuck was that>
Who the hell is Boxxy>
who the HELL was that?
Iiiiii...don't remember that bit.
08,01i am a terrible person:
otakon: Let me quote it directly.
Meanwhile: me neither
SpadeMagnes[R] Some bitch nobody cares about
i don't get it
Guys, gtg, rain in my area.
PUNCH!
08,01it's an accurate analogy.
bye VenHur take care
SpadeMagnes[R]: nothing
11,01The video used to end with Fluttershy saying the N word.
he's worried about being PC
Nittany_Discord: AH
Niggle?
08,01Nittany_Discord: nitrous?
It always sounded like Niggle.
otakon: According to EA and Bioware, Command and Conquer Generals 2 will not have single player. This is, in their own words, part of a strategy to "get back to the roots of what made Command & Conquer great."
Nigle?
yh sounded like niggle to me
nicotine?
Nigel?
08,01Meanwhile: fo shizzle.
If he did NOTHING then why is he discussing it? :O
neville?
05im sure the word was nutrient
Yaaay!
YES THIS
lol
CriticKitten: one more time? I got kicked...goddammit.
rofl
11,01CriticKitten: I liked the Single Player of C&C.
so cute!!!
Luna for 1000 years...
Nittany_Discord: <3
How was this a punishment?
EAT ALL THE CHOCOLATE MUFFINS
THIS IS WHAT LUNA DID FOR 1000 YEARS
He said the secret word!
aha!
05CriticKitten: the SP of the first C&Cs is waht made it so great
what does this video call?
05i loved the cheesy cutscenes
11,01I also love how EA speaks for Bioware.
Wrek: the mission briefing
Wrek/Nittany: Exactly! Thus why the statement from Bioware made my brain just SHATTER.
11,01I like the story.
I WOULD LIKE 10 BILLION KRABBY PATTIES!!!
Oh no, it's Bioware, Nittany.
Memories. <3
11,01Bioware didn't make C&C.
That statement came from Bioware's general manager.
They're the ones making the new game.
Nittany_Discord: bioware was indoctrinated by the rEApers, of course EA will speak for them
11,01They're probably being forced to make it a spin-off.
inb4 Nittany_Discord EA rant
XD
05if generals 2 wont have any campaign
05then fuck it im not buying it
EARTH
05i was LOOKING FORWARD to know what happened in that universe
05but oh well
Well then good news, Wrek, you don't HAVE to buy it. You see, it's a free to play game.
/me 11,01wonders if EA is trying to fail now. *shrug*
05would probably be Origin only anyways
11,01^
/me walks in and sees the video. Slenderman performs a perfectly executed headpalm.
They announced that Generals 2 was going to be Free To Play through Origin, and now they've said no campaign mode.
ok then... im going to continue on applejack beating the sh*t out of a SWAT
Origin is the future of gaming.
Steam is dead.
So basically IT'S NOT A GODDAMNED COMMAND AND CONQUER GAME

Wait.
Wrek: "and heres where i would put mass effect 3! IF IT WAS ON STEAM!"
She has nails?
So stylish

SpadeMagnes[R]: couldn't*
11,01EA is trying to fail.
God, that article....it just makes me want to cry. C&C is....like....it's my childhood condensed into a tangible form. My love for video games STARTED with C&C.
Nittany_Discord: so they can do like Enron did
Anyone want in a MvM game?
I bought The First Decade just to replay the old games.
I'm guessing EA is shitting all over another franchise?

Fluttershy cheers in different languages?
They also wanted to ban that Tentacool episode.
05CASUE WE WERE NEGLECTED AS KIDS
Wrek: kk :)
Wrek: 4kids logic
For being like 9/11.
Nittany_Discord: Mad Day by Rabies Bun(pony related)
More than half of the banned Pokemon episodes are badly arranged clips episodes. So rightfully banned, not even WE want to seem them
SlurryMoon
You mean like we cant say someone dies? We have to say they went to the shadow realm?
And that tentacool/tentacruel episode was bitchin.
None of them D:
11,01Wrek, you mean that r63 ep?
misty x tentacruel
yes god forbid we educate people ON THE CONCEPT OF DEATH
I saw that episode before 9/11. It was an okay episode.
05Nittany_Discord: im talkign generally
Also that tauros episode
Since it was banned where the shit did the 30 tauros coem from
wasn't that because of guns
Explain it 4kids ya twats
SpadeMagnes[R], I wouldn't characterize a story with killing in it as inherently educational.
yay!
SlurryMoon
dat top comment
Dat comment?
:D
Oh no, he pulls a gun out on Ash!
where?
BETTER PULL IT!
where is SlurryMoon?
iis that his tongue, or bottom lip?
otakon: did the baby start crying after i said space ninjas?
Azura: looked like his bottom lip
Bronysith: no
Buytoast, it's pretty much the ONLY episode in which it happened.
UP!
GO UP!
God forbid we dont show guns
Like yugioh
otakon: but i would totally understand if she started crying after that lol
Invisible gun fingers

11,01I don't want r34 to pop up, so I'll screen that for later.
Bronysith: I will teach her of games later on
Fuck, they even didn't show a Jynx episode because they thought it was too racist or some shit.
otakon: good, make her a true gamer instead of these wannabe assholes
Stream the pumkin avi full
Buytoast: black face, which is not really funny
Although they did it with popo
yup
oh yea
good times
WHICH WAS BULLSHIT!
goddamn blue Popo
ugh
Oh god this video
11,01Remember the days Ren and Stimpy was acceptable?
it's not like the Jynx would be saying "I LUV ME SOM CHIGGIN SIR!"
they didn't even DO IT WELL
Creepy as fuck
Wrek: I do.
it's a bloody pokemon.
Nittany_Discord: Oh, definitely.
Censoring the one episode of Pokemon in which guns are seen makes sense (except for the manner in which they did it). Censoring the guns in One Piece was absurd.
Love this song
...
Blue popo looks like more of a rapist than regular popo
poni poni yaaa
poni poni
Kandarihu: oh so much, and SO MUCH UNNECESSARY censoring too
twilight?
is that you?
cigaritte = lolipop :3
OMG
05want it need it is creepy
Kandarihu: not just the cleavage or guns, but stuff for the hell of it
05but awesome
Didnt one of the main characters in One piece actualy die?
Kandarihu: Those edits were the main reason why I hated 4kids
ace died
The chick with the blue hair i think?
11,01I do remember when the old Looney Tunes was regularly shown.
Hai guys
SpadeMagnes[R]: yh but the 4kids never got that far
/me bops head
Yea they just forgot that bit
What the fuck did I talk into?
11,01With violence and stereotypes and all.
the original video freak me out :O
SpadeMagnes[R]: oh yeah that, instead she get's imprisoned forever
11,01And Popeye the Sailorman.
evil twilight is evil
11,01I know old Looney Tunes did WW1 to death.
/me tackles Shamroc
well it's Dance of the Pink Elephants ALL OVER AGAIN!
I hated 4kid's style of censorship
ow?
11,01Now WW2, WW1.
11,01*Not
Video games got WW2
SpadeMagnes[R]: I hated 4 kids for killing some of the greatest shows on television.
You think 4Kids cutting out the Safari Zone episode made a huge plothole, they cut out two canon ARCS of One Piece creating more than two gaping plotholes that took further editing of later arcs to try to fill in.
05donald as nazi still is my favorite disney short
SpadeMagnes[R]: oh god so much here too. also, considering you NEVER see any nudity in One Piece I don't know why
Wrek: I should watch that one again
and been a shit long time since i came to this dead place
11,01Might I stream that?
Kandarihu: IKR?! I was pissed when they did that.
05well
SpadeMagnes[R]: POISON SUCTION
11,01It's on YT.
05im ok with it since its satire
Nittany_Discord: Yes please. I've never seen it before
PINKIE
otakon: STUPID POISON SUCTION.
AJIsAwesome: lol
Posion suction?
otakon: whats the first game you are going to show her?
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE POISON SUCTION.
Wrek: dur fuhrers face?
I got sick of the dub of one piece so I stopped watching it
^
I enjoy watchign the japanese dubs
I SAW A FIREBOY166 VIDEO
The actual good versions
i want what they've been smoking
11,01Before that, a new trend to lol at.
Kitty!
/me gives alexxm a bag
SpadeMagnes[R]: Some bad guy in the japanese dub used poison darts. 4Kids changed it to poison suction.
00,03To those living in Texas: Good luck out there!
SpadeMagnes[R]: when Don Krieg fights Luffy he hits him with MANY poison darts....in the 4kids version they changed it to Poison suction darts..that still caused Luffy to bleed and the voice actress acted like they took effort to remove
/me smokes whats in the bag
cat watching a video on tv...
lol
lolo
well i am off. bye everypony
I dont see the issue of the darts
lol
SpadeMagnes[R]: ............
AJTheMightyGamer: Bye!
Why take them out
otakon: how about when they removed 14 episodes IN HTE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION
goddammit you don't see the issue on how SUCTION DARTS CAN BE POISONED?!
or LEAVE BLOODY WOUNDS?
AJTheMightyGamer: bye AJ
I do
bye AJ take care
I dont see the issue why the darts had ot be edited I meant
SpadeMagnes[R]: I'll have to find the video of it
SpadeMagnes[R]: The fact they tried to edit something for an older audience to make it suitable for kids.
toast
otakon: you know they skipped 13 or so episodes in the middle of a sentence right?
HA

Too bad theystopped at the Skypiea saga. If it wasn't for 4Kids, One Piece would've been one of the most accaimed television shows next to DBZ.
