Too much synth in this song. >_<
Not enough synth!
Never enough synth!
When I joined my first forum I knew just enough to know that wouldn't work, but not enough to know how to actually do it
Synth all the things!
cool :)
and autotune ikr
7I kinda feel like I wasted my time on SC: surrounded by computer geeks, decided to learn nothing about coding or hacking.
http://cheezburger.com/6830415872
Can we move on to another song? One that ISN'T synth-heavy?
Though, it was still pretty solid.
Not all of us were computer geeks; I definitely wasn't at the time

Technically the entire universe would end, actually, not just Earth.
THATS EVEN WORSE
you know, I woner how the people in here would react to watching season 2 if they are reacting this way to season 1
13caught the glove, does that mean we win?
Wait...I seem to not care about type speed
Wow. That was a fast pitch.
13well i'm not doing season 2, and sumi's not doing season 2
Even, TENTACLE MONSTERS?
Why does everyone cheat in baseball?
my end is lagging immensely
13and then kyon gave the hax bat to a college team, which then went on to rule the world
13nice going kyon
Well the only reason they aired the episodes out of order is because the season ended boringly.

YEEEEEEEEEEAH
Pretty much, yeah.
and then the cloppers mock the furries.
and the furries die.
I've learned to accept Furries, actually.
It's just someon's fetish. Bestiality in practice is rape, because an animal cannot give informed consent.
hey all
hay
I'm sorry, how did this discussion come up?
lol she did it again
Cause it should be dropped.
said hi and left
Well, two links, really.
No...
heyyyyyyyyssss
one was an following link tbh
No one was trying to start this.
Yeah, let's go ahead and not discuss that topic kplz? ._.
yeah, lets
I figured we were going to have a conversation?
Get out.
Okay, we can drop it.
>Fall down a well
Not you.
complete tolerance not
Keep that shit to yourself or take it to another channel.
Fucking ad.
get adblock
It's the WEEKEND when things get stupid.
pendejo
:>
Why is the burden of action on me?
No need to use that kind of language YOUNG MAN
This ^
Yeah, just like how I completely ineffectively "tolerate" my brother. :)
But with the other one I could...you know...skip it.
get ad block and everything is fine
just get that ad blocker doohickey
Hai everypony
I don't use adblock on this site since I wish to support it
something wrong with the stream? it's laggy and the sound stutters here
You can still be tolerant and refuse to tolerate intolerance.
00,02CrazyHippie, we don't get any ad revenue :P
let me rephrase
specifically the 10th one.
00,02ohai
wt..
i won't tolerate you talking about tolerance like that
where's the problem?
:)*
my audio is crackling like popcorn
-Karl Popper.
Okay.
alright.
I'm done
There, we actually had a conversation.
it's just me or the audio is stuttering heavily
Yeah, audio stutter is getting bad. Stream keeps stopping too.
Guise, apparently its popcorn thats doing it
I feel like I'm on crack.
audio is a bit crackly and the stream is lagging. please fix
YOU ARE.
But I am a bit on edge cus I had two pots of tea today.
I'm the most into caffeine.
Yeah, why is this sped up
Tomokazu Sugita always talks fast.
the Bripsters
...
got to*. Too many verbs.
not working
the stream is still flawed
I dont always open the door...but when I do I get on the floor and walk the dinosaur
lol
must be an american thing
the walk the dinosaur thing
Walking the dinosaur?
I don't get it
well.
its always been all over 4chan
Less hot girls, though.
Didn't Walk The Dinosaur originate in the UK?
is it me or is there audio problem?
Meh.
or is this some upload speed issue
I dont always pony...but when I do, I pony pony pony pony pony
13i get it
13i can't do anything about it
Must be the file
but stiil :I
13no it isn't
still*
13it's vac
I adore amazon.com...
I dont always ship...but when I do, I ship Rarity and Spike.
what's going on?
Aaand the stream exploded.
the stream is going crazy
13people have been bitching all episode over an issue i can't fix without breaking the audio setup
break it then
13so i am understandably a bit miffed
13the problem is fmle is incapable of attaching to a process like every other stream program
I was talking specifically about the song Walk The Dinosaur. Someone said it was an American thing and while I can understand that because they're an American band, the song was released in the UK.
13it means i have to have my speakers blaring
And you shouldn't have to go deaf
I'm ok with this. :P
Then don't do it. I can read subtitles.
Um. Couldn't you just physically turn the speaker off or separate the mix volume? I thought both still worked during mixing.
(I wish I understood Japanese)
also that song
13pony_970: yes which completely defeats the point of audio, and no
I can see the headbobs
The band is American, but the song was released in the UK.
13normally i use virtual audio cable to send the player audio to line 1 which is then sent to FMLE
No, I'm missing the nature of the problem. Isn't it the case that you wouldn't strictly need to hear the stream for us to?
I have to get to school in an hour
it's interesting how many computers have their way to works
thanks everyone :)
say good night*
But physical speakers usually have volume controls or power buttons of their own. Shouldn't those be unaffected?
13i send it to earbuds
13thus going deaf
:I*
Oh.
Then that's different, yup. :P
Dang.
13and as for sending to speakers, that hoses my volume leveling for nonstreams
and ITS really loud on my end
13which is why i use line 1 for streams
I dont always use line 1...but when I do, its for streams.
13unfortunately VAC is a shitty program that likes to stutter randomly like that
13there isn't anything i can do about it
it has stopped for now
13i'm glad you're all grateful you get a stream at all
sure
okay all, brb have to download an update for FF
must be the GNAA
she should try yoga
I'll say this about Haruhi
I wouldn't be able to STAND HER
It's not unrealistic, that's a school-issue computer.

Hi guys, i know it's old but could some1 tell me wht happened during last saturday episode stream?:)
BY THE CHINESE
I mean magic duel stream
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ_xo2oTEY
Ok thx i thought it got hacked again?
You shoulda said saturday not last saturday
it did
05we didnt get hacked the episode before that either
Easier to understand
oh nvm
oh giod
here we go again
WATCH IN FEAR AS HE DISSAPEARS
k
05how hard is it
05to understand
05there
05never
05was
05any
05hack
yes technically it wasnt a hack
they'll never learn
05they simply found the keys to the stream the provider had hid under the doormat
13also it wasn't GNAA
got it
13they just want the credit
-_(\ ok hijack not hack
got it
Politically correctness
it was a single person right?
13yes
13who wanted traffic for his own stream
And he got his just deserts.
Did he?
GNAA i mean
13twixie_sprinkle: completely different problem
how desperate do you have to be
13that was a worm that spread via a tumblr vulnerability
13most likely GNAA taking credit for it too
Wht are u guys talking about?>_><_<
Oh yeah that, GNAA is taking credit for the tumblr worm thing too
"It's evil unless I do it."
And I know that wasn't them either
13nope
13so as professionally as i can say
lol
hello everypony
Quite
13also some dumbass tried to phish our limev details
yup
Miniature Ionized pony Sections
It was hijacked.
The streamers used
it's a special stream for the horses
13now we use ustream
Thought we used a different stream for FiM in Season 2.
13http://i.imgur.com/tXhTd.jpg
ha!
05besides
05when veemi crashed during magic duel
0510 secodns downtime
13yes do recall that we experience seconds of downtime at best

05WE JUST WENT THOURGH THIS
there can only be
reoccurances
/me scrolls up
i was there when more then half of the people left
Wait a sec,is that hijacker professional, and is it already dealt with?
PROFESSIONAL
05pfft
ahaha
05it was a reg idiot
wht?>_><_<
05regular*
lightIRC doesn't really work too well with scrolling; it freezes up sometimes as a result.
this aint no air force one son
on the other episode that got hacked
Yeah, it's why I decided to get my own IRC client
how about some Pinkie Jazz to cheer us up eh? :$ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8EF6L2Zo8Y&list=FLIWobWFql_3X0c2sKFQCW1Q&index=69&feature=plpp_video

yup, lets just relax
drop the subject
i already disliked it

05then copypasta it into the face of the next person that asks
You know someone is going to take the bait

00,02why would anyone use a streaming service that does that
i've not experienced ad problems
only reason i caved for that ad block thing

Okay, I'm back and I finally got that adblock plus thing.
D:
Pinkie is the best pony
theres a site that shows a pic of a kid flipping you off if you have adblock
I prefer Celestia, to be honest :$
Actually dude everypony is the best
there are too many pinkie fans here
hoodi shaddup, search ur feelings, u kno it 2 be tru
We need more Cmc fans
Pinkie Pie is an awesome pony, I'll give you that much. But I still prefer Celestia/Twilight/Rarity
I prefer Celestia over Luna, to be honest.
lunar republic ftw!
cmc is kewl too ofc
COME ON YOU BASTARDS YOU CAN'T LOSE TO HER

no idea
toothpaste you can swallow I think
but its really tasty
TRAINING TOOTHPASTE.
man this a crazy match :D
I wish i could play...
same here
*wish
a toaster could play TF2 on lowest settings can't it?
yu
WUBS
I liek wubs
also, there are tools to turn the settings even lower than the menus allow
There is no computer that cannot play it
hey the moon!
you dont need a good gfx card
Good times, good times. :<
Play TF2 without any textures XD
just enough storage for all the hats
This is a good song
Guys.. Far cry 3 is amazing. I cant believe the improvement from 2 to 3
o cool a stratch skin rofl
Farcry 2 was complete and utter repetitive shit. Far cry 3 is pretty damn amazing. HOW?
supply and demand
and crazy people
and then a tiger attacked me ;p
wubwubwub
/me ROCKS TO THE BEAT
Well that was eventful
or just cause
And they go down quickly
And in Farcry 3 they somehow made the funs extremely satisfying to shoot
D:
the pinkie clones kinda creep me out
Cya
Hey whats the name of that awesome music i want to look it that up later
Is.. is that fucking rainbow dash in TF2?
Hm? I can't hear the stream.
And theres helicopters and dogs and shit chasing you XD
Cant believe they included a semi-Rpg skill system to it too
at least killed someone
K, well, I needs some sleeps. Latas Bstate
3 talent trees, and most of the talents are really, really useful. Like being able to pull around guys after you assassinate them
/me flies away to his bread in the sky
Far Cry 3, I believe
yep
Oh.
Carry on
Cant believe the drastic change from Farcry 2 to 3. because farcry 2 was utter shit.
Every aspect is improved, especially the story

I dunno if that would be a good thing or a bad thing. Even though it's EQUESTRIA.
PONIES
Equestria has PONIES
I suppose I could live off ponies
If we all did voiped to Equestria, it'd probably be just like District 9.
lol
Would you be turned into a pony yourself?
If it meant being able to use unicorn magic I probably would
hit the frog
you can still hit it

Hello
Oh? :>
h
How cute! =D
08,01had a bit of a river tam moment just now
08,01my mum was making us some sandwiches, and she had two piles of bread
08,01she took one pile, and put it on the other
08,01so i said "it's a stack"
08,01she looked at me and said "what?"
08,01i pointed to the bread, "it's a stack!"
08,01she gives me that sympathetic look that mothers give, "yes dear, it is"
08,01"you pushed 2 pieces of bread onto the stack"
08,01"what?"
08,01"if you have another stack", i put my hand out, "you can pop from that stack onto the second stack," start transferring bread to a pile in my hand, "and they'll be in reverse order"
08,01"what are you doing?"
Saturn: :D
08,01bread is now in reverse order on my hand
inb4 Saturn was kicked from #bronystate for posting 7 messages in under 10 seconds
08,01"see! reverse!"
08,01and i put the bread back on the plate
Nah he's a mod
shh! saturn story time
^
08,01i then start wandering off into the living room, then call back to her "of course, it's more interesting if it's numbers!"
eh
08,01go on then
08,01you tell us a more interesting one
08,01we're all years
Many, many times.
Well.
08,01pony_021222: the channel is muted and you have the stage
Alright then.
This is a story all about how
LOL XD
xD
Rofl.
:D
lel
That's how we handle nubs
That was brilliant, Saturn :D
Saturn: A+! BRA-VO! :D
Lol
Wb random pony
He was right though, that nearly put me to sleep.
08,01anyhoos, i went back into the kitchen and said, "it's more interesting if the bread is numbers"
I've got to be honest, no one cares about the bread.
It's always about the numbers isn't it?
No one is riveted to their seat with anticipation about the result of the bread story.
The NUMBERS
It just isn't very interesting.
08,01pony_021222: right in the Fuhrer's face?
lol
08,01Meanwhile: well, no-one else is talking
08,01or rather, was
08,01otakon17: aye
Dammit
I was interested in the bread story :<
You do?
You've never struck me as the egotistical type.
08,01so you think my rampantly innuendous jokes *aren't* a cry for attention?
08,01mercy me
It's that self awareness that causes the image to paint itself this way.
Oh lotd
08,01but maybe it just means i have no modesty either
Lord*
Saturn: You are silly
You don't appear egotistical because there's a subtle realisation that you're doing it for the attention.
It's a good thing, really. Makes you not look like a pillock.
hi
Same person.
Oh
Hah.
I
/me hugs back
I had a moment there
I'm gonna get a coffee
Clinical terms makes it look sterile.
It just makes you look like a bit of a rapist, tbh.
Oi. Keep shit like that out.
:D
MolestWithGropings.
it somebody say 'rape'?
nope.avi
oh
Thingy? O.o
08,01DefileWithCuddles
Uhhhhhhhhhh
Saturn.......
I'm a thingy!~ 8D
I belive 'thingy' is the correct term.
08,01AssaultWithEmbraces: heh, sorry, maybe i got a bit too carried away there...
Yey~ \8D/
Saturn: oh u
Lol
http://phlim2.tumblr.com/post/36874268989/brbshittoavenge-etonia-lessthangrace
Made me lol
Yes, because hugs are such a terrifying weapon :D
I'M A MENACE!
Hugs are the #1 problem in America.
/me goes into hiding
:3
yup
Ponyfags are the #1 problem in America.
Oooh
Oh
Oooooh
And the world, for that matter.
America is a problem.

And that's you haven't changed you nick?

I hate to admit it, but now I'm intrigued.
But I've returned.

No stream

Maybe it's because I've been around a while.
No, you're lying.
Maybe it's because I'm infamous.

Then press F4.
lol
That is the most legitimate of advice.
No
I know that trick.
I'm not an idiot.
it closes ur program
Mostly because stupidity incenses me.
And yet it does still work sometimes.
Stupid only pisses off the ignorant
how could u say oOo

Did you like it?

Alright everyone! Goodbye!

Nooo Derpy. Don't hit the kitty

Am I the chat's chronicler of idiocy?
Do I record every instance of dumb that crosses my path?
If I did I'd be too busy to say anything.

You could diggy the shiggy daa doo.
08,01when it's too stupid in here, i just go to xkcd's irc channel

Probably more than you realise.

Sorry, that was my cat.
Dat wall of numbers
That's why my keyboard slides in.
:)
And more importantly, why do you find it acceptable to masturbate to the protagonists of said show?
lel
Immoral?
Um... wut?
Sorry, I can't hear you over the fact that I don't touch myself to pastel-colored horses
^
Utterly deplorable and more depraved than the entire furry fandom?
I like lasagna. It's delicious
Yup. That's me. As depraved as they come.
Furries are understandable, to a degree.
Whilst it's still sickening, the animals the members of said fandom violently pound their prize turkey to at least retain humanistic qualities.
I don't masturbate to ponies
lol
They are anthromorphised to some degree.
:$
And yet with these... horses.
>implying furries are just the hypersexualized ones
^
Implying /mlp/ isn't a totally accurate portrayal of the fandom.
That is all they are, stylized horses.
They walk on all fours, they eat fucking hay, they snort, they gallop.
Hey, I snort all the time.
Why do you ask us, ask /mlp/
>implying most of you don't go on /mlp/
I don't.
I don't
I avoid the horror that is FourChan
I already said that.
Don't steal my material.
You still frequent a channel that these pathetic fuckers dwell in.
Wasn't aware I was, don't see why you are.
Festering in their own bullshit and filth.
Somebody's upset.
:D
Alas, I find myself frequently disappointed.
Things always change
Was there ever any doubt?
It really did, but frankly you've brightened my day.
Watchu dl'ing?
Whatcha downloading?
Ah~~
Both of whom are absent 90% of the time.
Still pops in now and again.
Huh
Skyrim, egh.
dari is still here, but fuck knows if he pays any attention.
Hm?
Barely.
Ha
Oh you are alive dari, hey.
Howsit going dabi?
Not bad, how about you gaymoo?
I'm good.
That's a good lad.
Oh I bet he is.
I...was actually talking about the "OOOH Now you fucked up" comment but yippadeedoodah.
It used to be great.
Thats a bit rude
Exactly, whoever you are.
The truth hurts.
Fair point
Not just a bit.
DId I say thousands?
I meant like, 5 people.
Because those people are honestly all that's left.
goddamnitwrekbot
Eh, the 'good old days' change depending on when you joined.
Things change, they always do
And people tend to be averse to change
dabi pls, you're obligated to say that because of position.
But this isn't being 'averse to change', Dairy Queen.
example, when i joined this place in late-febraury
This is an opinion that is shared by just about everyone else in the same position.
and by then i guess Hipster_Brony left
They don't like it as much since it has changed
i found out about him via newsletters, that's how i ''know him''
Be completely honest.
Well Excuuuuuuuuuuse me
Newfoals can't hope-in-dabiforce.
and not just by stream change
I might have preferred things back in the 'golden days', but that's just me.
yeah i agree right here
there*
I do enjoy it still
Maybe not as I used to, but I still do.
I enjoy it for these brief moments.
That's understandable, Darikins.
BBL
And anyone else who's been following this amusing little affair.
I wish I knew.
I'll humour you for a while.
You're not Sprinks are you.
Come on Gaymoo, Kittywhile.
Hah, I wish I was Sprinks.
Or RX.
He couldn't of become this intelligent overnight.
...
But I digress.
Neil, it's notyou is it?
oh well i joined at a fun time
But, I guess I should stop now.
That was fun.
00,10Oh we going all nostalgistic now?
Pfft.
Wow Neil.
Anyway.
You fucking twat.
bad guess :D
lol
If you weren't lying.
00,10again?
i'm not lying :(
otherwise i would use this >_> <_< (AND THIS DOESN'T COUNT AS A LIE)
>.>
<.<
6_9
Hrm.
I'm surprised you didn't catch on earlier.
Except we still haven't.
Skype is too quiet, never made the connection.
Of course, that would have let you narrow it down to people inside the regs group, which was my intention.
this is like some warped scooby doo shit
^
Except BORING.
oh
Nothing happened.
move on.
^
Hey everypony
dont worry, i wont ask again
Don't get into it.
Implying I'm not friends with him anyway.
Frankly this has only made it a funnier experience.
Maybe

Anyway, back to my complaint
/me JOKE ABORTED
Anyone who's taken apart tonnes of PC's know how to get a PSU with a slightly damaged screw out?
unless you want to keep the PSU
00,10have to drill it out unless you got one of those cutscrews
Ahh bugger
I kinda *need* the PSU
/me gives a glass of warm lemonade
00,10then drill carefully
.-.
What's a careful?
00,10somthing you do when you want to keep the PSU
Ahh, I see
Makes sense
you could also try grips
and turn it the hard way
'warm lemonade'
Give me some hot kool-aid while you're at it why not.
00,10but yeah cut screws are a nice tool
00,10if you have a dremmle you could try and cut the screw head off
worth the extra cost
not sure if sarcasm....
<_<
/me hates not being able to detect sarcasm or a joke
only the cut screw lets you actually use that screw point again though
He can NEVER detect jokes :D
:D
Cause I can.
