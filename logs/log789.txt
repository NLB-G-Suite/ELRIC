BWOOMP
Flutterderp

GilDash: what JFFS said ;)
7hahahaha
7I liked the Mako.
Hey Wrek!

woops
trixie_squirtle: Funny. Google translate came back with "Rainbow Dash is best pony."
wubs
HAH!
7You're a fucking hover-tank! You refuse to drive over any of the liquids presented to you in-game without exploding. why do you hover?!
Well, could be worse, you could be one of those people that use them IRL.
WREK!!
:P
GilDash: well, we all know google translate doesnt work so well
@Wrek
7I'm unfamiliar with MFW
trixie_squirtle: Even Bablefish is saying it though. :p
7also, I often do.
My Face When
trixie_squirtle yeah that's how i got it :D
i think its a good thing Hasbro is getting rich from us
That is a mistranslation GilDash. We all know Rarity is best pony
:o
rarity and trixie are also acceptable ansers

Oh here we go... remind be why I didn't use "favourite" again? XD
Oh dear God
Rarity is my favorite pony :3
i always use google translate for appleness to engrish
who thinks that the Hub should remake Animaniacs
I think Spitfire is trying to kick Dashie off of my No. 1 spot anyway... :S
No
RainbowDashie: maybe
Not remake
why
Really? :P
7stop saying that it means nothing.
Todays censors would ruin the show...
DERPY
Animaniacs was perfect with all of its innuendos that bypassed 90's censorship.
good point
It wouldnt be as open as it once was :(
GOOD NIGHT EVERYBODY
^
Yes, 90s censors were the best because they never actually gave two shits about what shows that they let past.
rave that was amazing sexual innuendo
bye RainbowDerpy and RaveBrony
Bye RainbowDerpy :)
And speaking of 90s censorship...
I am a Pianist!
RainbowDerpy: G'night! :)
Bye RaveBrony :)
-_-
So many people dont know Animaniacs o_o
North Korean archeologists have discovered a "Unicorn lair." I laugh so had when i heard that
[adult swim] is gonna finally release Dexter's Rude Removal!!
bye RaveBrony
that was a reference to Animaniacs
GigabitHarmonie, my ears XD
RainbowDerpy: too late, you must go now!
i just need some snacks from my bacon tree
You say "Good Night Everybody!!!" when something that sounded dirty was said, lol
NOPE
RaveBrony, see this is why I like you. You get it XD
alexxm: Really! It's gonna be an adultswim.com exclusive.
:D
Panda: (\
RaveBrony: /)

Dexter's Rude Removal will be added to adultswim.com in the next week or so.

RaveBrony to be fair i said because i saw other people saying bye

RaveBrony: Really? Never heard of that before.

Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that "it doesn't work" means "I'm too impatient to wait so I'm going to make you run up 5 flights of stairs to make it faster."
GilDash: Look it up, im sure there plenty of compilations on youtube. Theyre great :D
this Xmas music is giving me a headache
Its basically Yakko's catch phrase, lol
RaveBrony: Maybe when I'm capable of lucid thought. :D

Too much synth in this song. >_<
gunthler: yes :|
Not enough synth!
gunthler: but i fixed it
Never enough synth!
so HA!
When I joined my first forum I knew just enough to know that wouldn't work, but not enough to know how to actually do it
oh hi GigabitHarmonie :) u streaming?
Synth all the things!
Eeyup cachi01. :)
cool :)
GigabitHarmonie: I NEED MORE COWBELL
and autotune ikr
7I kinda feel like I wasted my time on SC: surrounded by computer geeks, decided to learn nothing about coding or hacking.
http://cheezburger.com/6830415872
Can we move on to another song? One that ISN'T synth-heavy?
Though, it was still pretty solid.
Not all of us were computer geeks; I definitely wasn't at the time
picture: observe all shuks what i was given!
What the FUCK is this?!!
hey wat is pink and disposible
gnight everypony
Hahahaha.
I still feel like I don't know anything compared to a lot of people on the internet, but whatever, I don't want programming to be my life anyway
That is the power of Screwball.
hey wat is pink and disposible
Pinkies mouth
GigabitHarmonie: Applebloom: "Seriously"? :P
RainbowDerpy: bye
bye
Ahh, no synth.
yes
Just how it should be.

RainbowDerpy: so now pinkie has a t34? Cool!

http://cheezburger.com/6814163712
I can't tell you exactly how many times I've wanted to hug Fluttershy but realized I couldn't.
Hello VenHur!

GilDash: your breakfast is a full meal for me :D

beans: WAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
/me is alone apparently
I wonder how many people would believe I can do that
MadSurge: It's a full meal here as well. It's usually actually eaten at brunch and serves as breakfast and lunch because it's so big.
GilDash: makes sense
hmm hmm
MadSurge: It takes ages to make, but it's so worth it...

It ain't.
I didn't know Bon Jovi has a restaurant with no price on the menu.

That is for you to find out, trixie_sprinkle.
DashWithRainbows: well until i find out, i'll have to keep experimentating myself then

You're missing out, trixie_sprinkle.
Bronysith 3
Damn fine series.
alexxm: FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALSE
I have more taste in Fossil Fighters Champions.
Bronysith which one is it
trixie_sprinkle: It's easily one of the better Pokemon games out there.
I'm at the part with the foggy forest, GilDash.
Only started last night.
alexxm: fallout 1
Dat Celestia
DashWithRainbows: Ah, I think I remember. It's been a couple of years.
She took a shower.

GOD that is disturbing
kk thx DashWithRainbows

pony_1502: just go and quit your bitchin
Not much to do, sorry if I offended you.
Jingle Bells, Batman smells, Robin laid an egg...
GilDash It's name Fogbound Lake.
LUNA
The Batmobile lost a wheel and The Joker took ballet
Not sure you may remember it though.
DashWithRainbows: Is that before or after the guild expedition?
/me hugs luna
so many awesome magic duel pics now
It is the expedition.
aww
DashWithRainbows: Ah! That explains it then! XD
The only part about this expedition is the following:
This reminds me of how I got banned 3 years ago.
YOU'RE PAIRED WITH A BIDOOF
GYAAAH
Now I remember
annoying part*
DashWithRainbows: Yeah, but to be fair, rollout isn't all that bad.
pony_1502: huh, i dont think bronystate was around 3 years ago
He never uses it.
Only growl.
Sure seemed 3 years.
But it really felt like 1000
DashWithRainbows: Just deactivate his useless attacks and leave only Rollout on... if you can do that.
You can't modify his moves
Which sucks.
Headbutt is alright with the cringe affect on it.
DashWithRainbows: Oh, is he on as a guest member at that point?
Yep.
Balls.
Bidoof forgot Giga Impact to learn Growl!
i remember buying one of those fake pokemon games as a kid, pokemon jade. was trippy stuff
DashWithRainbows: In that case, don't forget your reviver seeds. :D
Pokemon Creepy Black for sure.
i never beat it either, didnt know what to do at some point
why would you do that pony_1502
I always pack at least 5 reviver seeds.
Whenever I see them in the shop, I buy the,m
It was just kinda funny
them*
Is it bad that I still build cars out of Legos
Nope.
What song is this
She's afraid someone can see her somewhere off camera?
dat jaymoo lurking?
DashWithRainbows: I played Explorers of Sky, and they had the Spinda shop. It made getting gummis really worthwhile, because you made a drink from them and got stat increases.
Oh, it's the cameraman.

Hello everypony :)

Forgot about the series after a while until I found my old PMD case.

Isn't there a new one on the 3DS in Japan?
It was pretty good, not many of my friends liked it, I loved it however.

There is one for the 3DS out right now, only in japanese though.
Awesome times
Looks okay, still prefer 2D.

Ok, Not missing too much, I can get back to writing.
GilDash I remember a dungeon with 99 floors.
It was torture
so fucking old posts
DashWithRainbows: Yeah, but that was the "Congrats, you've beat the game, now beat this."
True.
That videogame is steam powered.
I think you find either Mewtwo or Deoxy's in it though.
Not worth 99 floors
dat cheerilee
Meh, it was if you wanted a good challenfe.
challenge*
I can see myself staying up all Saturday playing that one dungeon
That's what I did.
I just wanna say
I love all you guys

I don't think I'd ever finish it.
wub
Love you too!
Love you too Polygrammar o3o
Infinity mode: Play till you drop
Sat on the sofa, bottles of soda and some pie in the kitchen, grinding the hell out of it.
DashWithRainbows: I think there was one that was also 99 floors but removed all your items and set you to level 1.
Yeah, I think that was it.
wow
Get to level 100 by floor 32
Bloody hard but was an amazing challenge.
Made you want to grind your EXP before taking on the next floor.
what game are you talking to?
what? Thousand Year Door?
My teacher isn't a pony. Just a 47 year old Science human

DashWithRainbows: Who are you running with? Mudkip and...?
I think NFS Nitro
i got totodile once
I'm a Cyndaquil.
lel
I got Cyndaquil when I played
and a Phanpy friend
Suddenly Mafia
nice radio voice.
I got Piplup
But I kept doing the test until I got Cyndiquil
Ironic, Typhlosion is my favorite pokemon of all time
Wait

DashWithRainbows: I think that was Sky only.
Derpy_Hooves! :)
Dayum.
Lucky.
/me hugs GigaplotHarmonie :3

/me hugs Derpy_Hooves back!
DashWithRainbows: Eh, he wasn't all that good to be honest.
First pokemon I got to Level 100 was Typhlosion
o,o
dem plot pics :S
Hmmm
/me gives everypony hugs
and what's this about pokemons
Oh look! It's my mousepad!
XD
i kept on doing the test until i got totodile
I went with this pair because of the weakness/strength could cover each other.
/me never got any pokemon past level 50 :(
How many times did it take you?
derpy <3
You rub your mouse on his face? How could you
/me hugs RainbowDerpy :3

P-HAA!
pony_1502: whats your project for it?
Mealworms eating either Corn/Apple/something else
I wish I could've had Ralts as a starter.
See waht they choose
/me feels alone
Ralts would have been pretty cool.
Alas, I had to go with /actual/ starters.
/me hugs aniderp :)
My first ever Pokemon game was Crystal. Best storyline of all games I've ever played
i never gotten The sky and darkness mystery dungeons yet
Crystal was pretty epic.
>animation error in new episode
Hey YO wuts up everypony:)
Heya scout19_tf2 :)

Heyo, Scout
The fact you could go to Kanto as well was a brilliant addition.
Yes
YES
YEEEEES!

Not in any other game D:<
THE YOUFAIL.ORG SONG
my fav pokemon games was gold/ruby, never played crystal/emerald though unfortunately
Something with WIZARDS

Are those prerecorded messages or is he doing them at the time?
You should be able to go to more than just Kanto and Johto
Play me Manheim Steamroller and Trans-Siberian Orchestra the rest of the year. I'll be in a happier mood then :D
/me hugs aniderp btw :3
The best we have is the World tournament in BW2, pony_1502.
AW DAMNIT
I was abotu to go to sleep
And then this song
:P
my fave pokemon game is Hey you pikachu! its one of the best games ever for that sony system
:)
Someone did house lights to that song.
How does the level system work if we can go to more than 2?
:D
Someone yelled at their TV at 2:00 in the mornig playing that
if Snorlax isn't your favorite pokemon well then why are you even trying anymore

after all you have some inferior creature in your heart, you are destined to failure

:>
and now i doing it for fun
or a portal gun
pony_3045: so wuts ur level
wat level?
I've been playing a whole ton of NFS Most Wanted latelt
The new 2012 reboot is awesome
pony_3045: in bym
wat bym?
I outran Koenigsegg's and Bugatti's in my Nissan GT-R
pony_1502: they made a reboot of most wanted?
Yes
nice
pony_3045: if u didt get veni vedi veci from backyard monsters den where did u get it
nope
Fave car is Nissan GT-R. Look up my username on Google (berberborscing) and I was on a blacklist for NFS World
My car is Nissan GT-R
The nissan GT-R is faster than a Bugatti Veyron?
:P
i talked about vvvvvv
I race-tuned my GT-R
I like the R34 Skyline better
wut?
O.o
People like to tune the Bugatti but... they can't control it. Fail
great now i want to go play nfs or forza
:I
search vvvvvv veni vidi vici
youtube
kks
So who's playing music for us atm?
giga is
The two fastest cars are the Bugatti Veyron and the Ultimate Aero
oh nice!
and that what twilight doing at chrystal empire )
I'm quite enjoying the music right now, actually.
Koenigsegg Agera R recorded a top speed of 271
so thats why shy Twilight Viridian
MPH.
was the fastest
Hush now, quiet now
oh i know this song
its from that pony show
Bugatti is a heavy car that i think is overpowered
that adult like
weeeiird
I was so glad that Koenigsegg beat it in Bugatti's face
bugatti op nerf plz
this is nice
is this smile smile smile by applejack?
lol I don't want to go to sleep
Bugatti: 1001 HP and top speed of 260? That's not overpowered?
no sweetie belle rest ur head
I loved the McLaren F1 until that Bugatti smooshed it
what about the ultimate Aero
I don't care much for the aero
Bugatti is uglu
but people drive caused by performance
When I raced the Bugatti when I played, I drove next to it and crashed it into the wall 7 times.
:) Hope you enjoyed that interlude!
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSC_Aero
I did
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agera_R
pony_1502: thats a nice looking car
Yea
Bugatti is so fat and... well... Slower!
:I
there
damn
So one time I went to shake and steak and got one of those free cars with the kids menu once
pony_3045: oh now i under stand well they also use dat frase in bym
and I put huge paper hubcaps on it
k
and when i was done with it, it was a box of cardboard
Wait, I thought GigaplotHarmonie left BronyState?
stuck inside out
ScootaChicken: Why would I leave? :(
Well, either way it's great to see you! (even though I talk to you on skype loads anyway, haha)
Trixie's Wild West Show
GigaplotHarmonie: I read somewhere on the front page that you and Allegr0 had left the site.
Starring Trixie
the SSC Aero is 2,800 lbs
Maybe one of us will meet me online, and get to race my Black Nissan
GigaplotHarmonie: Glad to see you:). Glad you're still doing Gigabit's Hamornies here
WAT
FLutterboom?

hi thelonepony :)
ohey thelonepony:)
/me noms on MLP_Brovakiin o3o
Pinkie is...well...PINK.
i was thinking the same thing :P
Hi scout19_tf2 :)
I have one of those OBEY posters in my room
VenHur: IMPOSSIBRU
cut that out and stick it on the wall somewhere
pony_1502: he was just joking man :)
would get so many wtf looks.
hahahaha
pony_1502 who is fluttershy
/me slaps thelonepony around a bit with a large cow
^
StinkomanFan: Haven't seen you in ages man, how've you been?
thelonepony: wus goin on :)

VenHur Im gonna beat a mothabicka with another mothabucka
StinkomanFan: I've been alright too, loads of schoolwork mind.
thelonepony: You are no longer a cubone!
/me slaps VenHur with a thelonepony
You are now a grown up orphan
ScootaChicken: at least this semester is almost overwith
cube is now pony
cachi01: Blasphemy!
One does not simply kill Dashgor with one arrow!
glomps Bronysith
Yeah, yeah... I've been working in my senior year.
BRB
VenHur: lel
/me carries Haku1013 to bed
<3
I've got a horn, I can, you know, use magic?
/me doesnt want to go to bread
Oh yeah Bronysith, you like Death Note, don't you?
ScootaChicken: well, up till after you died >.>
This is a rather... ambient song?
nyeh
If you're a unicorn and can just teleport, who needs flying
Sounds like something from a videogame of olden times.
If only you can teleport
Bronysith: Well here's a thing me and my friend did: https://docs.google.com/a/ucs.org.uk/document/d/1EIu-tNpU026JkFT-Ful4koBPrRdGWyQ7E9y1Oxg7g-8/edit We're performing it for our next GCSE assessment, I'd appreciate any feedback you have :3
GilDash: indeed...
ded
Sames goes for anyone else here who happens to like Death Note.
this song reminds of terraria
GilDash: just mute and listen to other pony songs
Teleporting is obviously a very difficult thing to do, since Twilight had trouble with it at first even though her talent is magic
Just be careful to not violate the document too much.
She formed that talent with practice, anything is hard at a toddler age
ScootaChicken: what a fanfiction? or just acting out? XD, sounds fun
Telekinisis is probably the only thing any unicorn can do by default
Yes, but she used telekinis in the 3rd episode
Reading minds?
guys
Bronysith: We adapted the first half of the show for our next assessment, but we need the script to be as good as possible.
I'm not complaining, just noticing.
And she looked exhausted after just 3 times using it, and those were just short distances
why not
ScootaChicken: right, ill read it and let ya know, grammar and all or other cliches you could possibly avoid XD
Applejack didn't learn anything.
I learned that the Flim Flam brothers suck.
Is that real?
YES
RANDOMNESS
:)
Bronysith: This is me you're talking about, I doubt there are any grammatical mistakes, and even if there are, it's mainly the content I want feedback on (particuarly the last few acts, which I changed rather dramatically from the source material.)
He's teaching us how to stram
stream*
I've basically made the last couple of scenes a Death Note Yaoi fangirl's wet dream.
flim kissed applebloom
yay
Molestation is imminent
btw whos streaming dis
Giga.
I was preparing to type Jinx.
oh k tanks doc
Nice program, what is it?
What DAW is this, Gigaplot?
Bronysith: Lawl, I wish, this is a GCSE piece for school.
Giga is the professional
im very hungry, gimme that Apple
ScootaChicken: ahh
I'm sorry, I sell pumpkin pie.
Bronysith: The guy playing Light is actually one of the worst actors in the set, our teacher chose our groups for this, unfortunately, it's lucky I got to be in the same group as the guy who's massively into Death Note.
ScootaChicken: ahh okay
Is GigaplotHarmonie streaming? :O
I'm a fan of the Vectorman games.
yep
Back!
You're performing Death Note in Drama, ScootaChicken?

If any one don't know what is Vectorman, it's a game from the Genesis, it got a sequel.
Throw *ALL* the instruments away ! o/
why the fuck is there an origin symbol on my desktop?
Why is it always just Tia, Luna and Cadence? Why is there never Blueblood?
:P
What's the name of the software in the stream?
Ohai GilDash :)
woona
Here was a trick question I was asked in my school:
thelonecubone: Holla! :)
Luna freemare
Woona Freeman
Haku1013: becasue they sent him to a zebra bootcamp after his diisplay at the gala
Now I am pokemanz
/me throws a ponyball at thelonecubone

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Poll Results: Did Your Opinion of Trixie Change After Magic Duel?
It seems to be more...disturbing than a good tune.

Thanks :3
ScootaChicken: instead of 18 more episodes of stupid shit, well done bro
MUFFINS!!!!!!!
:)
GigaplotHarmonie, what type of setting are you trying to achieve in this piece?
sound futuristic
Bronysith: I don't think it's how the series should have ended. I do however, think that the series shouldn't have had all the time skip bullshit, it should have ended with L and Light.
Near and Mello are a pair of fucking bellends.
ScootaChicken: exactly....but seriously, im sure all the fangirls are going to love you
I'm gonna find a correct remix of a song I like and post it
i think Death Note is slightly homosexual
...
slightly?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_qF_FSfm8E
is that...
maybe not so slightly
A FORBIDDEN LINK?
pony_1502, no video link during streams
That is a song from Most Wanted's Soundtrack
Sorry, forgot rules over such a time
pony_1502, now u broke the wools!
I dyed! Goddamm ir

pony_1502: Decent song.

Thanks
Nice background song for the stream
gigabit streaming goodness?

I want to voice something
CountDoofus: He's streaming dubstep, but I don't know the software.

^ Underrated song is underrated.
ded
VenHur, OH GOD SOMEONE ELSE IS WITH ME
I LOVE Flim Flam song
^^^ is an amazing song
so hard to sing
I love Super Squeesy Something 6000.
and I just watched the music man like yesterday
I think that some cars that are overrated pwn when tuned
well that is the greatest song
It's one of my favorite songs too :)
i love how they kissed applebloom
so at least you aren't completely wrong
flim flam got higher in my top music list
Ooh, Ustream
Someone online pounded 3 guy's butts in a Porsche Panamera in most wanted
I could hear this in a video game
of course in a spacey level
We'll be coming back?
It is in a game
so this is a remix?
nope
Yes, KillSonik remix, that exact song is in the game
some guy makim one
a remix of what?
*makin
Calvin Harris' "We'll Be Coming Back"
pony_1502, not that
Oh
the one GigaplotHarmonie is doing
you dolt
<3 Calvin harris
i still like dat babs seed remix:)
Any one knows the program GigaplotHarmonie is using to make the remix?
Cause I would love to try it out for myself.
letme check
Oh, is this GigabitHarmonie streaming?
let's go in fulscreen and zoom
is GigaplotHarmonie making really a remix?
VenHur: why dnt u ask him
my guess is that its FruityLoops, but im not on stream
Also VenHur you good in music composition?
scout19_tf2: Cause he stealin' muh brownie.
Boredd. So bored I see double D's.
either way, i would recomend FruityLoops
I shouldn't be watching this. I've been thinking about trying to make music too, but then I'll lose interest in drawing. Same thing happened when writing fics, then moving on to drawing :|
CrystalPhoenix: Not really, but I sometimes like to make either a remix or an entirely original song in general.
freaking ad scared the dizzle out of me
GigaplotHarmonie, you better type it out
Mixcraft
lel
MAI MACINTAHSH
GigaplotHarmonie: Dat voice.

A trial version, eh?
GIGAPLOTHARMONIE

I hate USTREAM, I mean, sure there's no lag, but I hate the ads that appears briefly.
And its a sick baseline
VenHur: adblock
i love ustream
VenHur, spoiler: Adblock+
But the whirring doesnt fit Imo
No ads here. Yay Firefox.

VenHur, you should've had that ever since you downloaded Chrome
lol
i already have it on chrome

Speaking of "Chrome"... has anyone here tried Chromebook? I'm wary of google's attempt at a Netbook.
CrystalPhoenix: Yeah, I guess you can say I had no brain sometimes...or maybe I does...
Hm..
Randomnerd: wat.

G'night everypony! :)

J_E_Smith71: LOL wasnt paying attention to stream xd
trixie_sprinkle: :D
Blueblood's a prick
RainbowDerpy, Rainbow Dash always dresses in style but she needs clothes for that. Who's making clothes? Rarity that's who
Thus, Rarity is best pony
VenHur: after the last episode its practically canon that she has a mean side to her
inb4 rarity is 2nd best poneh
since when does RD make sunglasses
VenHur: as in permanent mean side
Ooh, my dad gaved me a muffin...
RD only said that in G3
whats G3?
VenHur: DERPY MODE ACTIVATED
oh yeah
Generation 3
oh yeah
dat RD pic
friendship is magic right?
Its Mario Kart 64 noises
thats G3 right?
stupid sexy rainbow dash
THE WORST GENERATION
the G we like is G3.5 right?
G3.5 IS WORST KILL IT WITH FIRE
but i thought we were G3.5 fans
G4 IS BEST OUT OF ALL GENS
G3.5 makes Chuck Norris cry.
We like G4
i can tolerate most of G3 and 3.5 BUT NOT NEWBORN CUTIES
RainbowDerpy: whats G4?
g4 doesnt exist
cachi01 I love how you still manage to bait people
THIS ONE DUMBASS
G4 is the ponies you see now
CrystalPhoenix: lel
srry

That should be my avatar on BF3.
RainbowDerpy: well yeah. thats kinda what i was lookin ay
trixie_sprinkle, now look at that, Rarity is indeed best pony
for*
no RD is best
Rd is worst
duh
no DH is best
CrystalPhoenix: eehhh..shes on the top 3 at least :P
RD is best
DH is 2nd best
how can a background character......
>Best pony
trixie_sprinkle, you do not grasp her complexity then
Rainbow Terrible is one of the worst horses
next to white selfish
oh forget it
So what we screwing with
>Opinions
DashWithRainbows, we're just having fun
CrystalPhoenix: but twi and trixie are complex too
there's a song called "Shot Yourself In The Foot Again"
Shush
the only correct choice for the best horse is yellow quiet
don't ruin it with that word
You're ruining mine >:l
OH NO BUFFER
trixie_sprinkle, twi is mary-sue and trix is tsundere
ITS PONY TOAST
yellow horse has huge angerm anagement issues
NOT HORSE
pony_9001 is over 9000
PONY
elemt of kindness my plot..
trixie_sprinkle: r u sprunkls in a disguise?
they're horses
^
=3
THEYRE PONIES
whats a horse?
big jack is best pony
CrystalPhoenix: dunno either of those
whats a pony?
ITS A HUGE DIFFERENCE
cachikorita01: no >_>
What's oxygen?

RainbowDerpy: you

Celestia.
you are a human
Some type of bread I think, RainbowDashie.
RainbowDerpy*
lel at the tab fails
One does not simply fly into his lair
Only one
Shut your face :3
lel
Barbie there is no rainbow-colored alicorn
hell, the only horses that may be better than yellow quiet would be the cider sliders
its is PONY not horse
Pony are the smaller ones.
pony = horse
what is a horse anyway
Twilight, no grammar fixes plz
Omg, Its pony. Take some freaking wakeup pills.
but still, white selfish is the number one worst horse
*pony>horse fixed
lel at the newbz
Ponies are smaller horses
and are better
purple magic is the middle horse in it all
its PONY
cloud fast is best horse
Cach, atleast I can spell Chickorita Right.
If Ponies are smaller horses, what about those two horses from Magic Duel with Celestia?
Lol.
xDX
although pink obnoxious is an alright horse i suppose
u guys are brony n00bs
VenHur proper horses?
pony_9001: atleast i know how to use tab :3
alexxm: Seems legit.
and let's not forget queen horse
and suddenly shit is /mlp/
she's a pretty big thing
Saddle Arabian ponies. Other far-away nation, other builds?
hm
Cach, I do too dumbell.
/me facepalm due to everyone saying 'horse' instead of 'pony'
^
Saddle Arabian ponies...
FORESHADOWING
Horse is a dirogatory term
Use pony instead
its discriminating
pony_9001: and its chikorita
so u double fail
RainbowDerpy: I know. THey should just go out and get a horse if they want one so bad.
Wats a pony?
i still dunno why so many people like Evil Horse
/me facepalm
Fyi, I thought Friendship was magic when we are fighting.
Can't afford a floating cloud for mine.
barbie u are retarded
more than derpy
oi bronystate
oi
oi bronystate
Derpy ain't retarded!
She just silly, ya know

Buytoast if you say horse one more time, I think you might give RainbowDerpy cause the speed the process of 2012 up
Daw, look at the Fluttershy picture.
THE END TIMES!!
Feel that love.
she is, thats why we call her derpy
:3
meh, gray unfocused isn't all that great of a horse either
I thought Derpy wasn't a female at first.
/me blows up world
And then everyone died.
I can totally imagine one of the horses Princess Celestia brought from Saddle Arabia could be named Laurance.
IT IS PONY U IDIOTS
NOT HORSE

GigaplotHarmonie... are you actually playign that???

bronysith quite trolling

You have a piano connected correct?

it was a typo
GigaplotHarmonie, how is it connected? USB?
celestia is best horse princess
Ah, dammit... why did I have to pawn mine.

you know, does apple horse even have that many fans?
Buytoast: she is outshined by muffin fucker
idk
Buytoast, she does have some fans. I'm a fan of hers.
i thought applehorse was a bakground character
Dat Twi face.
Hey Everypony
fair enough
hi ImAProYouDontKnow
dar horn
are u saying 'horse' just to piss us off
cachi01: *Background, and are you talking about Applejack? Applejack isn't a background character;
GigaplotHarmonie, how is it connected?
confused twilight is confused
DinkyDoo: she isnt?
CrystalPhoenix: via usb.
i wonder which horse is the most forgotten
RainbowDerpy: only you are getting pissed off
Oh alrighty
no im talking to cach
cachi01: NO. She is the element of Honesty, part of the Mane 6. MAIN 6.
no its Mane 6
not Main
cachi01 Bronysith you two knock it off stop fucking with the newfoals
:L
Main sounds like Mane.
Both are used
sowwy Shammy :I
So in case you don't get why its called the ''Mane'' six, I used ''Main''.
Most of the Crystal Ponies, I'd say they are probably the most forgotten.
its a pun
probably
horses have manes
the rock horses aren't all that memorable
DinkyDoo: uhmmm you do know i was just messing a little wit u guys right?
Now add some base and snare and you got a hip hop lullaby!!!
cachi01: *I, With, You. (Sorry, I had to correct..)
cachi01...a little? come now stop being an ass
DinkyDoo: lol
Dinky its a pun, horses have manes
even with sombrero horse assaulting them and such
Oh...
Mixcraft?
LOL
lol
Lol.
Yep.
lol
XD
XDDDDDD
DAT AD
Gunna go get it
:D
ownership is magic
That's right. King Sombra is more notable than the ponies he was trying to conquer. And then we gripe about how weak characterization he got.
At first, I didn't know what Mixcraft is until I found out.
at least we dont see shining armor or cadance ever again
I'm gonna fall asleep listening to this music sooner or later..
hopefully
Kandarihu: well they all had weak characterization
Thanks to the holy grail of Google's search engine.
Bronysith: inb4 they appear in next ep
hey who here can name any GOOD cartoons on nowadays besides MLP
don't corral your horses before the running there boy
And it's true that he did have weak characterization, compared to the other villains.
the mary sue horse force will strike again
that's hard
and they will save the world again
cachi01: wouldnt be surprised, considering the last episode was one giant fucking mash of all the fanfictions ever
Wait, who is streaming..
RainbowDerpy: gravity falls, adventure time, gumball, regular show
it was hilarious like that
Gumball sucks
they said in 2014 NFS will work with Disney to make a movie
Bronysith: indeed it was. one of the best imo
Hmm
Guys
cachi01: I agree on Gravity Falss, but the rest I can't agree on..
Give me a food name.

DinkyDoo: you know getting that ending is fucking hard right?
Buytoast Brilliant.
DinkyDoo: one does not simply get it by accident
get wat
cachi01: What, I got it once...
GigaplotHarmonie: so when do you and alleg0 do your show
/me licks GigaplotHarmonie
I watched the Season 3 premier again lately. And you know what? It's not even about Sombra. It's not REALLY about the Crystal Ponies either. It's about Twilight Sparkle trying to follow Princess Celestia's directions and prove herself. This is an odd case where the primary antagonist could be seen as a minor character.
ew
Wait who even brought up Super Filly Avdentures?
RainbowDerpy: blank flank ending is super filly adventures
in*
Who even brought that up?
THe Experiments of Twilight Sparkle ending, now THAT was scary
uhmmmm

LAVENDER TOWN

Lavender Town: Missing Frequencies
If I hear one more ping
pinky pie style!
IKR
lul
The missing frequencies scare the heck out of me
im back computer crashed
i do too :3
I LISTEN TO ONE SECOND OF LAVENDER TOWN MISSING FREQUENCIES.
RainbowDerpy: well that sucks
sonicdude558: was your plushie a commission?
yep
I feel like i'm going to die.
huh>
you remembered?
I HATE LAVENDER TOWN
Then don't do it, Dinky.
It scares me.
sonicdude558: you bought a twi plushie right?
DinkyDoo : Tell me about it.
DinkyDoo: THIS IS UR TIME TO PAY
Yes it was a commision. The person apparently moved and lost internet
THIS IS UR JUDGEMENT DAY
cachi01 : Shush.
DinkyDoo: I find Lavender town fascinating
so my parents don't know where its @ right now
I declare judgementation.
That's on 12/21/12
The Lavender Town I like is the Lavender Town theme from Pokemon FR/LG.
that already happened
sonicdude558: ohh, i see, you didnt already pay him did you?
oh brother the doomsday nonsense again
her
the mayans didnt know about leap years
lol
yes we already paid her... $300
MINE!
But LD:MF (Lavender Town: Missing Frequencies) just makes my ears hurt..
Okay I should stop getting on the internet now : PrincessCholestrolia
back on OCt 22
/me is ready 4 12/21/12
/me takes the 300 dollars
You better run, I heard a ping
/me takes the 300 dollars
I hear the sound of his keyboard.
/me blows it on pony stuff
ha you won't be getting it for 2 months
PrincessCholestrolia: Tag, you're pinged! :P
SUCCESS
I hear the sound of myself typing because I'm right next to it
Keyboard Cat :D
sonicdude558: wow thats terrible. i hope you get a hold of her again, try tracking her down in some way. what she's done might not even be legal
Venhur: You never said no tagbacks
hey which of the CMC is the cutest
RainbowDerpy: fluttershy
Dont care.
scootaloo~
Applebloom.
I was suggesting that my parents should spend the extra $100 and get a Whitedove plushie
sweetie belle
Who wouldn't resist the face?
not a valid answer cachi
applebloom
RainbowDashie: i mean zecora
HOW you can stay mad at the face?
she isnt either
when she stole your boyfriend.
spike then
he isnt either
sonicdude558: do you have any idea how long it takes to make a plushie though?
...
waaaaaaaaaaaaaat
just kill one pony and stuff it
cachi01: *What
Etsy said it would ship on Nov. 14
not too hard
No shipping notification after that
trixie_sprinkle, I don't know. Sounds like it's akin to ordering something at the drive through of a fast food restaurant and then driving off after paying for it. Not really illegal, but just messed up.
I wish I could sing
do u even know who is in the CMC cachi
Cutie Mark Crusaders
dat princess miyamoto and random dad of twilight
lmao
THAT'S HER BROTHER
/me facepalm
cachi01: That is not her dad.
sonicdude558: so 2 months then approx since order, k got it thx
maybe after getting my microphone I might consider singing lessons
no
cachi01: princess miyamoto XD
neither of them
oni_link: i just had to make that pun :D
and those arent their names
Princess Cadence (i think) and Shining Armor
you dont say
Kandarihu: yeah it probably wasnt a leal contract unfortunately, i'll have to be careful if i ever buy a plushie, which i wanted to do..
cachi01: And the princesses name is Princess Mi Amore Cadenza.
legal*
its italian
cachi01: Princess Cadence, for short..
DinkyDoo: dem fanon names
cachi01: that was hilarious
those are the CMC
There's the CMC
oni_link: lel
cachi01: Do you know anything about ponies?
dem backgroudn ponies
i doubt it
background*
APPLEBLOOM, SCOOTALOO, AND SWEETIE BELLE!
theyre not background
they're main characters sometimes!
cachi01: what did i say! stop being a dick!
they have speaking roles and whole episodes
if only it was made to order...
Shammy: ok sorry lol
Anyone wanna have their ears bleed?
If so PM me
cachi01: *Okay

RainbowDashie: pls learn to tab
Row Row fight the Power
Do the impossible, Break the unbreakable... Row Row fight the Power!
cachio01: One does not simply learn to ''tab''.
u dont have to be old to spell cholesterol
It's nice
cachi01: Don't you mean ''Type''?
One does not simply do something simply.
DinkyDoo: nope
DinkyDoo: tab
One does not simply eat something you do not believe is butter.
o my
EXACTLY
One does not simply find a shiny Pokemon.
One does not simply say 'I can't beleive it's butter
such a cute fluttershy
My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my stack of butter!
lol
BRB
damn
One does not simply breathe oxy- nevermind.

/me slaps RainbowDerpy around with a large trout
Leonnatus: boom

PrincessCholestrolia, just don't let it get out of hand. Too much RP gets annoying.
For spam I beleive?

This sideshow should be playing more often instead of that old buffer show.
Anypony agreed?
VenHur: Since we're using UStream the slideshow has been used all the time. No more buffer show

So, once again Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 is on discount. For once, I have money in my Steam Wallet and no more probation against spending it. Is there any reason to buy L4D1 with L4D2 or not?
Great games, worth the cash. Some people prefer L4D1, I'm in the middle.
I actually like L4D2 more.
AGH!
Shizuka time
But they are both good games.
I had my volume up so high. :D
The Dark Shizuka Rises
Oh, I was planning on asking this question to Shizuka specifically. I didn't know she was around.
And she's looking for your chocolate.
yay :3
Shizuka!
When the stream is in ashes then you have my permission to stop streaming
Yay!
Im thinking about getting into the dawn of war series, which one should I get?
FOR YOUR CHOCOLAAAAAAATE!!
VenHur: did you say...chocolate?!
SpadeKyurem[R]: Yes sir! With or without nuts?
VenHur: CHOCOLATE? CHOCOLAAAAATE! CHOCOLAAAAAAAAATE!
I have 6 days to get £10 for copies of L4D1 + L4D2...
I think this can be done.
/me runs away
Man, as of Friday evening, I was under three self-restrictions at once.
sounds kinky
Im thinking about getting into the dawn of war series, which one should I get?
jcelios: :S
Kandarihu: How so?
I don't like doing Homework.. D:
One of the restrictions was for a billing screwup with Steam. Nothing that would get me in trouble, But for reasons I don't want to go into, I decided to restrict myself from spending from the Steam Wallet and running Magicka, which I had already recently bought DLC for.
DinkyDoo|Homework, I don't think anyone really does unless it's interesting o^o
Kandarihu: Ah, I see.
weylin|Blarg: Homework can be interesting. :D
I just have to read for Homework, though, so its not that bad....
is it just me or is the ausio wacky?
*audio
Dark_Horst, I get cracks here and there
The second was less of a punishment and more of a challenge. In Space Pirates and Zombies, the save file in which I got the Freighter Hull in Chapter 2 got corrupted and I forgot how to do it. So I had a hard time figuring that out again.
Kandarihu: Ouch, that stinks.
weed...?
Anyone wants to have their ears bleed?
Damn dat ytp fad
No thanks, CrystalPhoenix.
In other words can anyone help me out on something
She had DISAPPEARED.
CrystalPhoenix: That depends. What do you need help with?
Well, it turns out that the key is having UTA assistance and using bombs to knock the Freighter off course.
comcast, i hate you so much
LOST. So does that mean ded?
And the third restriction was the harshest. I honorbanned myself from Bronystate again.
and i'm back, for the fourth time :I
shitty comcast :I
I need a food name for a Minun.
Oh, AJIsHaunter|Homework, I didn't notice you were gone.
Well, it turns out that the key is having UTA assistance and using bombs to knock the Freighter off course.
What should it be?
dat naruto
Kandarihu: Ah, my apologies. My chat crashed and I had to reboot it.
/me pokes cachikorita01 o3o

No longer with us.. is Kuu dead?
So the third restriction was the harshest. I honorbanned myself from Bronystate again. 72 hours. I missed BMN, the episode premiere and EMN and whatever awesome stuff happened around then.
Kandarihu: you missed slendermane
Wing Cancer :_(
^
cachikorita01, So a ponified Slenderman?

CrystalPhoenix: of course it isnt lel
CrystalPhoenix: im just naming her like that in the mean time the fandom gives her a name
cachikorita01, lol. Dat creepypasta.
13oh i see what you mean about the derps
13moment
So, were people spamming R63 too?
I did Youtube the episode. It was the first time I ever went to Youtube for the episode.
cachikorita01 Regarding that image link; TL;DR
DashWithRainbows: lol
DashWithRainbows: its about the faceless pony being a virus or something
Now if only this guy with the Warez-BB thread would release the WEB-DL 720p version. All he posted so far is the HDTV 1080p version.
THAT'S the crappypasta?
it's even more far fetched than i thought it was
Meh.
13dammit vac stop derping..

AJIsHaunter|Homework: Because we hate you
CurlyQ: Haruhi Suzumiya, I think.

HoodyKazam: Oh shush! :D
/me noms on thelonecubone :3
Well then.
Did that girl's boobs just jiggle?
/me noms on HoodyKazam :3
/me slaps tehlonpot around a bit with a large cow
:3
/me ran
13the last three times i streamed this people were jumping over each other to watch..
13why so dead
Brother_Aura: Yes. Yes they did
Alright, Haruhi!
Shizuka: Haruhism is dead
well my leg has been hurting all day so i cant jump very well
/me slaps sprunkls around a bit with a chancla
have no idea
13RIP GOD
i have no idea whats going on anyway
maybe times change Shizuka
/me slaps himself around a bit with a bucket ;~;
thelonecubone: i hpe that thing is clean
Shizuka: Do they ever expand on why Haruhi has these powers?
omg i love her voice.
Hmm for some reason people think Bronies are pedophiles on the Internet.
13she just does
/me slaps hoode around a bit with a chancla
:3
I'm theorizing that it's all withing Haruhi's dreams or something.
[Alpha]: Blame society?
does show have any plot left though?
13NOM
Oh no the dreaded Chancla it used to be scary
is this bleaaaaaach?
dam nom
naw
Hmm. I see that as a big plothole for this show, then.
I blame ignorance and society
cachikorita01: its has more of an a adventure
cachikorita01, It's haruuuuuuhi
hey everyone
so its Jojo Bizarre adventure's blachi
Hi TROctavia :)
13AJIsHaunter|Homework: i think it's mostly because the question is academic
Kandarihu: EHRMAGERD GUD KNAUS
13the only thing the universe needs to care about is that haruhi has the ability to wipe it and start over
Buck it. I'm permanently changing my name to Golden Cyanide
thelonecubone: lel
cachikorita01, YUSHUH!
Shizuka: Yeesh, she's pretty dangerous.
So I'm guessing she's not from Earth?
13we may never know
AJIsHaunter|Homework, the only alien in the group is Yuki.
:D
Alright
And she's also a robot.
Kandarihu: Ah. So everyone else are humans, just with special powers?
dat ass
13AJIsHaunter|Homework: yuki's an alien sent by the Data Integration Entity or something like that, mikuru is a time traveler from the future, and koizumi is a psychic
Mikuru is from the future, pretty boy is just an extremely gifted psychic.
And we just basically said the same thing. :P
Shizuka: Ah, I see.
Hmm
Back..
Welcome back, DinkyDoo. :)
I don't think I said ''BRB''..
AJIsHaunter|Homework, well, yes. Mikuru is from the future. Itsuki is an esper (but was born human). Kyon is the most special of all to her. He spoke to her in class when nobody else would.
13aww dammit kyon let the humans a thousand years from now deal with the effects, CHEAT MAN
say any chance we could watch cromartie high school some time? preferably starting wednesday next week or later
..
Finally
Kandarihu: Okay. Now I understand.
13probably best ask sumica
dawww
13he has more drive space to acquire things
okay thanks, its more of a suggestion if we run out of stuffs
I'd probably have to watch this show from the beginning in order to fully understand. This is one of the only times I've ever seen this show.
on my iPhone
[Alpha] is my old username now I prefer this one
Sumica: You there?
oh yeah, u stream works on iphone, which means stream during class :3
13AJIsHaunter|Homework: you were not here for the last three streams last week?
*ustream
cant beleive it works
lol this is my first time watching this show too
AJIsHaunter|Homework, the episodes as aired are all over the place. Shizuka's streaming this in chronological order.
Shizuka: I was here, but probably AFK or working on college work.
AJIsHaunter|Homework: you want to ask about cromartie?
he's asking about this anime
dawww
sprunkls
..
I like how he literally said "a bashing /party/".
ook
Japanese baseball?
If I ever did see the streams of this last week, I probably saw short snippits of it.
I think he was trying to imply he would be made into a pinata.
man if we randomly started cromartie this week it would probably cost me my finals grade
Wait, is snippits an actual word? I'm trying to say I saw short clips of it here. :S
lol pwned.
...
Holy crap, since when did Team Rocket have a baseball team?
I would say so
AJIsHaunter|Homework: i think its a word
Whatever I'll stick with this
Ah, I misspelled it. I meant to say "snippets.
*"snippets"
inb4 god gets pissed over baseball and destroys the universe
I joined in late here.. why are they playing baseball
Eddmario: since that episode they played baseball for pikachu. or am I thinking of Sonic X
XD
The fact stuff gets warped to a pocket diminsion when ever god gets pissed worries me
Hmm
typing on the iPhone sucks
Kind of
what they need are some bats and balls and gloves with autotargetins systems (i wonder if anyone will get the reference)
PrincessCholestrolia: That's why you should switch to the Galaxy SIII
jiggle physics!
twixie_sprinkle: I was going to ask Sumi what that anime was where they have to battle in virtual reality in order to upgrade to higher classes in school.
@twixie_sprinkle, Fairly Odd Parents, I think?
Oh geez that escalates quickly
Lmao.
I take it they're lesbians?
pony_970: nop :P
*jiggle jiggle*
hmm... i sense :( here..
No, wait, Jimmy Neutron.
pony_970: yes :D
I knew it was one of the shows on Nick.
my momS phone
And both of them had a baseball episode involving cheating. :P
cheap I
I don't like Samsung
Magic points?
Need more Mana
wut is she..
ohai
Fuck
what me?
so this is how they play baseball over there
doing..
XD
Kinky
So how long have we been using UStream?
not very long
dat punishment
AJIsHaunter|Homework: well google isnt helping so idk what its called
WHOA WUT
Kandarihu: Ever since a couple days ago, IIRC.
/me has no idea what the fuck is playing right now
twixie_sprinkle: That's cool. Thanks for looking for it, though. :)
/me hugs his imaginary Twi plushie then ustream
np
AJIsHaunter|Homework, so, since Saturday?
and then the world was ending because they're losing a baseball game
Kandarihu: i think it started out like 2 days ago
whats going on suddenly?
/me pulls out his imaginary Twilight Sparkle plushie, based on that one Lyra plushie from a couple months back
Hey whoever is using an iPhone. I recommend using irc999 it's a good app or chat clients
Kandarihu: Ah, now I remember. It was early Sunday, that's when they started using it.
Im waiting for the eventual "panic" when the 21st rolls around
frickin commercial just ruined the moment.
For
hey look I can use my voice too
so are we watching this in chronological order or broadcast order?
I'll just be sitting at home playing Wow and watching ponies
AJIsHaunter|Homework, ah, okay. Thanks
the_real_pony_1604: chronological me thinks
the_real_pony_1604, chronological
For those of you new to the series, he was bucking serious. The world will literally end if Haruhi gets upset enough about this.
Kandarihu: No problem. :)
SpadeKyurem[R]: I'll be sitting here laughing at the idiots rioting and all the chaos going on.
i see haruhi and i think i missed an ep of haibaine
13and just like that the world was saved
way faster than typing
pony_970: Wow. :S
Wait seriously
Or I'll just be sleeping in
The world fucking ends if god gets pissed?
SpadeKyurem[R]: over a high school game of baseball, yes
13yuki, start your hax
pony_970: thats pretty scary.
SpadeKyurem[R]: That's impossible. After all, how can something get pissed if they don't exist?
Baseball got alot more serious
She isn't aware that she's god. Her teen angst will manifest in disasters related to closed space.
it's like I can talk to you guys
13that run
oh fuck :o
HAX
hah
13>what does that mean
damn
13>HOMING MODE
just like jimmy neutron
WHY IS THERE ALWAYS CHEATING IN BASE BALL!
Homing mode?
So, she's a Tohou, whatever the fuck that is?
oh dang that bat got bucked up.
*lurk*
Oh, now I see.
"there is a limit to ridiculousness" said the anime character
har har
13no no
The bat homes in onto the ball, correct?
I would fucking hate to live in this universe
oh god theres a spider cricket... :'(
13"there is a limit to ridiculousness" said a character in HARUHI
A girl who doesnt know she's god has to be happy enough or the fucking world ends
my iphone is going crazy
This reality sucksd
*sucks
well, at least god is cute
Forget this I'm gonna go play Borderlands 2
HAX
SpadeKyurem[R]: It kind of does when you think about it.
Shizuka: never seen this before, i take it they dont think too highly of logic and physics?
im scared..
13THE BALL IS HAUNTED
SO, is it true all the high schoolers in Japan are white and look like they're in their 20s?
Technically the entire universe would end, actually, not just Earth.
THATS EVEN WORSE
pony_970: ........
I can talk in the iPhone so I can type faster than any of you
13Dark_Horst: well, your god is a moody teenaged girl who doesn't know she has the ability to destroy the world in a heartbeat
this is a riged game of baseball
you know, I woner how the people in here would react to watching season 2 if they are reacting this way to season 1
13caught the glove, does that mean we win?
Oh Celestia, the Endless Eight.
Shizuka: well, it's a start
Wait...I seem to not care about type speed
Shizuka: Hazarding a guess but is there a episode where she ever figures out she is god?
Wow. That was a fast pitch.
13well i'm not doing season 2, and sumi's not doing season 2
13SpadeKyurem[R]: nope
So, I take it this anime has almost every Japanese stereotype in it at one point?
13but now that the plot heavy episodes are out of the way, this series is free tobe crazy
SpadeKyurem[R]: If she ever found out, it would be even worse. She's an immature teenage girl. What do you think she would do with /deliberate/ omnipotence?
Even, TENTACLE MONSTERS?
Why does everyone cheat in baseball?
oh god frickin spider cricket is right in front of me and im flippin out. :(
my end is lagging immensely
13and then kyon gave the hax bat to a college team, which then went on to rule the world
SpadeKyurem[R]: Because it's fucking hard as hell to play without cheating?
CurlyQ: Capture it and release it?
13nice going kyon
man just imagine having a girlfriend that would destroy the universe if you did something wrong
twixie_sprinkle: So...normal then
SpadeKyurem[R]: yeah :D
Now way.. im a total arachnophobe
Hmm sounds normal enough
Well the only reason they aired the episodes out of order is because the season ended boringly.
twixie_sprinkle: Aren't all girlfriends like that?
I want wanna piss her off
Japanese croque?
it jumped on my leg earlier..
Lel
i wonder if killing her would make things easier
SO THAT'S WHERE THAT DANCE SCENE WITH FEMALE LINK ORIGINATED!
Kandarihu: The season finale was when she was in that monchrome space of her school?
good mother of celestial this is just a cartoon
*monochrome
im just gonna rage at the thing till it leaves. :[
Kitty!
cats are evil
you're going to love him
although i guess she would get to her godly form and kill the universe then anyway
AJIsHaunter|Homework, in terms of episode airing, yes. They scrambled the whole thing to save the best for last.
what if we are evil and cats are only trying to save the world?
There's NO way those 2 guys are straight if they dance like THAT!
Kandarihu: Ah....
conspiracykeanu.jpg
So, the next episode's the hentai one?
WOOOHOO HENTAI
More desu! :D
i should know by now that after haryhi my ear are in danger
que no cachikorita01 :I
Hello peoples :)
ali project ftw~
hoi Rainbowish
Uh, I don't remember any hentai in Haruhi
13Eddmario: can't really trust the "next episode" catches of haruhi, they're out of order
AJIsHaunter|Homework: desu desu desu~
hello Rainbow ish
Well, I'm outta here.
Red Hamster X has to be the best name ever
Hi Rainbowish
thelonecubone: Needs more desu.
desu desu desu
13when we last joined desu and friends, the plot of the series had kicked in
thelonecubone: :(
oh shizz idk where the cricket went...:S
Kandarihu: They wouldn't run hentai on here anyway:p
malo cachikorita01, malo :I
this group has some neat music
cachikorita01: Yeah, no. I doubt they'd air that kind of stuff on here.
thelonecubone: :(((
/me hugs raonbowish
cars!
are we watching the whole playlist?
AJIsHaunter|Homework: LOL HOMEWORK >_>
so are you guys going to evetually stream all of haruhi? and if so will the OVA be involved
thelonecubone: dat russian?
whoa suddenly depressing..
cachikorita01: Oh, shush! :D
suiseiseki
this opening reminds me of another anime :I
TROctavia: Of course we see the whole playlist
twixie_sprinkle: naw, spanish
thelonecubone, Code Geass?
^
^^
oh boy
eh, somewhat close
always the kid in glasses
thelonecubone: its the same group that did the first code geass intro, ali project. i looked them up a week ago, they have awesome music
twixie_sprinkle: but me speaking/writing spanish is broken to me
and ah
okay
thelonecubone: also, malo means "not much" in spanish?
1 does not simply say 1 does not simply
I think I missed the recent episode. I'm guessing Shink was injured to the point where she's unconscious?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Spotlight Music: Babs Seed - Daks Edit- / Have You Met This Pony Yet? / The Other Half
thelonecubone: or not enough, little?
twixie_sprinkle: Malo means bad, if I remember correctly.
Another day, another Babs Seed remix
twixie_sprinkle: naw, Malo means bad
ah ok
*Shinku
AJIsHaunter|Homework: eeyup

Was there a old fish in..bed?
Oy.

Shizuka: Unless the blinky light has burned out
SpadeKyurem[R]: I think he was wearing a blanket.
I feel really bad for Mr. Krabs in this episode.
XD
Love this
SpadeKyurem[R] I bet you'd like an old fish in bed
Shizuka: I never understood that either
13well, the tick tock then
im still wondering if mr krabs reeally fucked a whale......

I got the most feels from Azumanga Daioh

FlutterMEDIC: I actually thought they were going to die.
Shizuka: Even in the winter months?
13you will all be bawling like tiny baby men by the end of this series
i hate dogs and cats being put down in movis ;_;
lol I cried during one of the pokemon movies when ash turned to stone.
i be like a crying baby woman shizu?
CurlyQ: OH GOD IKR
cachikorita01: Of course. Everyone doesn't cry at the same things.

Shizuka - backstory on the fake wings?
Azumanga Daioh make me bawl.
13wing covers

I cried watching Hachiko
oni_link: Hachiko?
Azumanga Daioh is kinda similar to FIM.

13silly rakka you're only supposed to take off running when the guards spot you, then find a convenient bale of hay to hide in
Why is there hay in Japan?
lol AC much
13hay why not :3
THERE ARE NO HORSES IN JAPAN!
O.o
o i c wut you did there
ba dum tch!
and dont tell me ponies eat hay too.
Everyone knows the national dish of Equestria is the cupcake
13HAS THAT GIANT MADE YOU CRY MISS? FEAR NOT! SIR QUIXOTE WILL ASSIST YOU!
DrawMotherbucker: are you daft, what about hay fries?
DrawMotherbucker: there were horses in Japan dude
oni_link those have only gotten one mention so far...
FlutterMEDIC I haven't seen em. Japan is also too small.
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mebv9ukODI1r5xybio1_500.jpg
still you can't go and say cupcakes are the official dish
Sent to me by a friend

They've gotten more mention and screen time than hay.
lolol
So her wing is injured?

LOVE AND TOLERATE PEOPLE
YEEEEEEEEEEAH
Pretty much, yeah.
and then the cloppers mock the furries.
and the furries die.
I've learned to accept Furries, actually.
It's just someon's fetish. Bestiality in practice is rape, because an animal cannot give informed consent.
hey all
hay
I'm sorry, how did this discussion come up?
lol she did it again
Cause it should be dropped.
said hi and left
Jmo: by one link
true story
Well, two links, really.
hiyo Sarah_B
No...
heyyyyyyyyssss
one was an following link tbh
No one was trying to start this.
Yeah, let's go ahead and not discuss that topic kplz? ._.
Randomnerd just felt the need to reply to me and get on his soapbox.
I was just mocking about the famous Brony motto which is a complete joke
yeah, lets
CrystalPhoenix: ikr
I just posted on reddit's gonewild. props to anyone who can figure which one is me ;)
I figured we were going to have a conversation?
Get out.
but you know, idiots and internet
Okay, we can drop it.
>Fall down a well
CrystalPhoenix: maybe its a joke for most, but that doesnt meant it shouldnt be followed
Jmo me?
Not you.
Sarah_B.
Sarah_B, why would you, like, post something like that here?
twixie_sprinkle, common sense should
Oh god, Kokoriko viliage flashbacks...
The whole thing depends on the community, I think. Bronystate has the reputation to be quite stuck up and intolerant.
complete tolerance not
Keep that shit to yourself or take it to another channel.
DONT TOUCH THE RUSTY METAL YOULL GET TETANUS
Fucking ad.
CrystalPhoenix: tolerance is common sense in a way
get adblock
Bronystate is fine, most days.
It's the WEEKEND when things get stupid.
twixie_sprinkle, would you tolerate a burglar barging in your house and steal your plasma tv?
Or Bronystate can just switch back to the stream that doesn't require me to sit through fucking ads.
DrawMotherbucker: get Adblock then
pendejo
CrystalPhoenix: tolerance doesnt mean ignoring someone, it just means not hating
:>
Why is the burden of action on me?
No need to use that kind of language YOUNG MAN
13DrawMotherbucker: protip, they all have ads because they are all free services
Which stream actually doesn't use ads?
This ^
13we don't have ads even though we pay a fair amount to keep running every month
That's what I mean, Randomnerd. It's turning into a closed community.
Yeah, just like how I completely ineffectively "tolerate" my brother. :)
But with the other one I could...you know...skip it.
get ad block and everything is fine
just get that ad blocker doohickey
Hai everypony
DaringDerpy: Why should we be tolerant of people pissing and moaning about a Colorblind Casting for Cinderella?
I don't use adblock on this site since I wish to support it
something wrong with the stream? it's laggy and the sound stutters here
You can still be tolerant and refuse to tolerate intolerance.
DaringDerpy you sound like The Doctor.
so basically being okay with it
00,02CrazyHippie, we don't get any ad revenue :P
13< important scene btw
let me rephrase
Karl Popper explains the logic of that...
Randomnerd: wuttttt....
Randomnerd: thats selective tolerance, which isnt really true tolerance
specifically the 10th one.
Hai Phase4
Phase4: Brb gotta switch it on
00,02ohai
hi Phase4
twixie_sprinkle true tolerance is a myth.
wt..
let them bitch and moan, Randomnerd
i won't tolerate you talking about tolerance like that
where's the problem?
DrawMotherbucker: only if you dont try to achieve it
Hi Phase4 L)
:)*
DrawMotherbucker: and it doesnt even have to be perfect tolerance, just as tolerant as one can be
Bronystate is great, may get crazy go nuts on the weekends with all the people just coming in for the new eps, but the regulars and the mods are some pretty fun people. That's part of why I keep on coming back
“”Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them...We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.
my audio is crackling like popcorn
-Karl Popper.
Okay.
DrawMotherbucker: and i mean genuinely as tolerant as can be, without self justification
alright.
TROctavia: same.
U win the debate twixie_sprinkle.
I'm done
TROctavia: Turn off the microwave. Your popcorn might be overcooked
There, we actually had a conversation.
Randomnerd: like i said before, tolerance=/= ignoring, it means not hating and condemning
takes it a bit far, Randomnerd. "be intolerant or else be destroyed." ^^
CrazyHippie: Ok, i'll go check
it's just me or the audio is stuttering heavily
it is TheGreatAndPowerfulT
and now the OP is sped up -,-
Yeah, audio stutter is getting bad. Stream keeps stopping too.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: it's the same here
Well, if someone's trying to destroy you, DaringDerpy
Guise, apparently its popcorn thats doing it
Why is the OP sped up?
I feel like I'm on crack.
audio is a bit crackly and the stream is lagging. please fix
YOU ARE.
yes. I am lagging very much so.
But I am a bit on edge cus I had two pots of tea today.
pony_970: naw, i'm more of a pot person myself :>
I'm sad to have to miss out on this now
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: PMV: Inspiration / Curelle de Vil / Day Three: Pain
I'm the most into caffeine.
video sounds a bit too fast for some reason
Yeah, why is this sped up
Tomokazu Sugita always talks fast.
if someone is trying, he will find himself destroyed. but this doesn't apply to our fringe groups. neither the cloppers nor these permanent "oh my god spaghetti"-moaners
DaringDerpy: yeah the spaghetti thing is more like a "hah im so much better" thing
twixie_sprinkle Lets call them the Brony Hipsters
the Bripsters
I'm missing a joke, aren't I? What's spaghetti got have to do with it?
...
got to*. Too many verbs.
it's the people who always complain about how embarassing 90% of the fandom are
Just go to Know your meme, search spaghetti and you'll know.
Randomnerd: spaghetti is social awkwardness, often used in regards to brony fans who are doing something that might create an awkwardness around them unintentionally
DaringDerpy: Well, there's always something wrong with someone.
Open the door get on the floor spaghetti everywhere
clean it up with sock
not working
the stream is still flawed
I dont always open the door...but when I do I get on the floor and walk the dinosaur
lol
DaringDerpy what?
the walk the dinosaur thing
Walking the dinosaur?
I don't get it
well.
its always been all over 4chan
This is basically life as a professional web designer.
Less hot girls, though.
when people explain stories in green text, if its all a fake, then sometimes at the end they'll throw in the walk the dinosaur
Didn't Walk The Dinosaur originate in the UK?
is it me or is there audio problem?
Meh.
or is this some upload speed issue
AJIsHaunter|Homework: Perhaps
I dont always pony...but when I do, I pony pony pony pony pony
13i get it
AJIsHaunter|Homework, do your homework :I
13i can't do anything about it
thelonecubone: I am. Just came back to see what's on stream atm.
ah
Must be the file
but stiil :I
13no it isn't
still*
13it's vac
I adore amazon.com...
I dont always ship...but when I do, I ship Rarity and Spike.
TROctavia: I've seen this quite a few times. Still doesn't make sense. People find it funny, yes. Maybe only because others find it funny.
AJIsHaunter|Homework, those guys were the band that did walk on the dinosaur
DrawMotherbucker, you monster
um what
CrystalPhoenix: Ah. I thought they were just taling about the song. It said that the song was released in the UK in 1987.
what's going on?
DaringDerpy: It's a very strange form of rolling
Aaand the stream exploded.
the stream is going crazy
13just shut up and let me work
CrystalPhoenix what's the problem?
Probably got that virus from Haruhi's site.
Shizuka: I JUST got in here, no need to be snippy
DaringDerpy: Not rick or duck rolling, but similar
TROctavia: so this actually is all about it
13people have been bitching all episode over an issue i can't fix without breaking the audio setup
DrawMotherbucker, I do find the whole spike crush cute but actually shipping him with best pony? Heeeeeeh Yeargh!
break it then
13so i am understandably a bit miffed
What issue is that? The audio and stream skipping?
CrystalPhoenix you haven't read Like Fine Wine then.
Shizuka: I'm sorry but I just walked in and I was asking what's going on in general, the "um what?" was the only thing directed at the stream. Sorry it's giving you issues
13the problem is fmle is incapable of attaching to a process like every other stream program
13unfortunately every other stream program has no idea what to do with video players
DrawMotherbucker, and you haven't read Green
13because the last time i tried attaching to the player people complained that the video was too small
Shizuka, have you tried up Stereo mixing
CrystalPhoenix I'll look that up
13this is stereo mix
13it means i have to have my speakers blaring
Shizuka: bah small video that WORKS is better than video that doesn't work at all I say
13because stereo mix applies the system volume control before sending the signal to the input
13which means i go deaf for your enjoyment
And you shouldn't have to go deaf
I'm ok with this. :P
woah wait what am I saying
small sacrifices
Um. Couldn't you just physically turn the speaker off or separate the mix volume? I thought both still worked during mixing.
(I wish I understood Japanese)
I use stereo mix to mixed up microphone and speaker
also that song
13pony_970: yes which completely defeats the point of audio, and no
I can see the headbobs
catchy song Shizuka
13normally i use virtual audio cable to send the player audio to line 1 which is then sent to FMLE
Well, I'm gunna go to bed anyhow, so, good night everyone
No, I'm missing the nature of the problem. Isn't it the case that you wouldn't strictly need to hear the stream for us to?
night TROctavia sleep well
13this takes the player audio as is so i don't have to be deaf with system volume
good night TROctavia :)
Good night fellow spaghetti lover
I have to get to school in an hour
13stereo mix allows all sounds through but at the expense of requiring i have system volume turned up
Night TROctavia :)
Night, TROctavia.
it's interesting how many computers have their way to works
thanks everyone :)
I dont always so good night...but when I do, its to TROctavia.
Shizuka: could you possible funnel it rhough a headset instead of your speakers for that to work?
say good night*
But physical speakers usually have volume controls or power buttons of their own. Shouldn't those be unaffected?
13i send it to earbuds
hey, who told you to stop working ayejay? :O
13thus going deaf
:I*
Oh.
Shizuka: :(
Then that's different, yup. :P
Dang.
otakon, do you recall where we heared this song before?
Hell my headset is at 30 locally
13and as for sending to speakers, that hoses my volume leveling for nonstreams
and ITS really loud on my end
13which is why i use line 1 for streams
CrystalPhoenix: I swear it sounds like mario
I dont always use line 1...but when I do, its for streams.
13unfortunately VAC is a shitty program that likes to stutter randomly like that
13there isn't anything i can do about it
Shizuka: so nothing you can really do about it besides just huh?
If they're earbuds, couldn't you just remove them from your ears instead of listening to potentially ear-damaging levels of sound?
13can't restart it, can't exit it, can't modify its settings, all because it's in use from boot up to shut down
it has stopped for now
I dont always stutter randomly...but when I do, Im a shitty program.
13i'm glad you're all grateful you get a stream at all
sure
I'm not always grateful...but when I am, its cus I get a stream from the lovely Shizuka :)
lul theyre using internet explorer
okay all, brb have to download an update for FF
must be the GNAA
she should try yoga
I dont always use Internet Explorer...but when I do, its because I'm a Japanese high school girl.
I'll say this about Haruhi
im fine with espers, alien robots, and gods in the form of teen girls, but using IE? this anime is soooo unrealistic
I wouldn't be able to STAND HER
otakon: but shes cute!
It's not unrealistic, that's a school-issue computer.
OH LOOK THE SHY ONE!
it's the show's Fluttershy
i dont always use internet explorer. but when i do, its because im high or crazy as fuck
pony_970: well good point, although most school computers do have firefox
I use IE because bing is best search engine
Why are the skirts always shorter than need be?
Depends on your school. My high school never had FF.
DaringDerpy: you're drunk, go home
DaringDerpy: HAHAHAHAHAH no
bah i hate bing
pencil stache?
DerpyMuffins: I have no idea. :S
:P
she's not meanwhile she can't pull off that look
Shizuka: Yeah it's no problem at all when its something you can't control over. I hate seeing when people make you get fustrated
i see my ass
otakon: lel
how is that even possible
oh wait it is
cachi01: With a mirror
I dont always bring a visitor...but when I do, she gets interrupted by a fucking cat.
cachi01: you're able to bend that far?
wait
what did she say?
Whoa that cat
oh God
thelonecubone: just a little
dat boob grab

AJIsHaunter: bc she's a bitch
Nagato is best robot.
AND THEN SHE'S STILL HUNGRY
So she's got Goku's appetite
DaringDerpy: that doesn't look right
CriticKitten: except she's not nearly as kind ...
did she just
13they're in davy jones locker!
Wasn't the VA for adult Goku the same as kid Goku in the Japanese dub?
SHE JUST BENDER TALKED
welp, gonna go to bread, night everyone :)
She /is/ a robot.
Night, thelonecubone. :)
AJIsHaunter: I kind of doubt it
13she's an alien
night thelonecubone sleep well
...they ARE in Davy Jones' locker. Why are they there? O.o
An alien robot.
good night thelonecubone
At least I'm pretty sure that's what they implied.
Shizuka: isn't she a robot though that is ALSO an alien?
oh great
i thought she was just an alien species that acted like robots
13she's pointing
alternate space that trapped him
.....welp
THE FUCK IS THAT THING!?
happens in the best families
otakon: I hear the Japanese version kept his kid voice because he's still kid goku, just older considering his innocence to things.
PROHIBITED!?
If I were to wager a guess, otakon, I'd say.....the End of Days?
Oh.
KATYDID!
Close enough.
GIANT FUCKING KATYDID!
Giant cricket?
HARUHIS A CUNT
Shizuka: remind you of anything :3?
13i wanna cast magic missile
Wait, Haruhi made it? :D
it's your friend and mine, THE GIANT WETA!
/me throws crayons at Shizuka

Hrm.
Welp, this ought to be interesting. Roll for init!
Wait I was just calling Haruhi a cunt cus she transported them to the desert
Good night everypony ^_^

Oy.
hey everypony :) is that a scarab?! :D
13that was easy
Hi, Sketch_Toku_Brony. :)
wat
Shizuka: yeah inb4 SECOND FORM
13this battle brought to you by staples
But they didn't even DO ANYTHING
pony_970 Kyon or Koizumi?
....
The computer club leader. Can't remember his name.
He doesn't have one.
...
That....
Might be the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
He was inside that thing, so I'd imagine it was taking data from his mind to create that space, including his love of games.
PETABYTES?!
You're kidding me, bc she DREW something she CREATED an ENTIRE DIGITAL RACE?!
13this is why web design is hard
okay this chick CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO ROAM
13you have to make sure you aren't unleashing eldritch creatures
It has that high of an amount of Petabytes?
Maybe. I have seen some pretty freaky shit in anime after all, have to weigh this mentally.
I know, right, Shizuka? And even if you're careful, sometimes IE will turn it into an eldritch creature anyway, but at least it's usually retarded then.
Shizu: Yeah, little known fact that one wrong html tag and suddenly Cthulhu's wrecking your shit
13what else do you think rendering errors are
:D
It's almost thirty THOUSAAAAAAND?
oh crap
13IIIII SAW THE SIGN
13something something ace of base i saw the sign
No
SHIT
No
no
a million times no
ok yes
what?
ace of base haunted my childhood.
Hello everypony
hiya texasboykc09
Hi, texasboykc09. :)
I dont always bring in Kimidori-san...but when I do, it's to ease Haruhis boredom.
Okay have ANY OF THEM thought what would happen if Haruhi just... I don't know... DIED?
13so now yuki is god
13we're so doomed
What are we watching
the melocholy of susimia haruhi texasboykc09
i wonder anyone made a pony ver of the dance... :D to the internet!
well yeah technically it's Suzumiya Haruhi
Okay, weighed it mentally and I suppose that isn't the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen, so I take it back. It does rank pretty decently though.
Episode Eight: Nekkid people
The hell is this show about anyway?
well that was random
YAY!
Whooo!
Shizuka: tell me more comedic shenanigans ensue
I wish I knew more about this anime than I do.
And more desu? :D
or is this a srs bznss ep?
13nope
ah hey Rosen Maiden havent seen this in awhile :)
13this gets feels too
Ah man, not the feels! ;~;
all I know is these two moe girls are living dolls.
Feels? I HATE feels!
NOT THE FEELS!
/me hates feels.
DrawMotherbucker: there are three of them actually
and that Suisei seki is a bitch.
Who's streaming
Hehehe. This is actually a good show.
texasboykc09: Shizuka is. :)
Hmmmm.
Shizuka: bad thing is I STILL don't understand teh premise in general of this show
What anime is this?
Rozen Maiden. :)
a bitch who really needs a smack upside the head
Ah. Haven't seen this show much. Watched an ep or two, wasn't interested.
Only reason I haven't watched this is because I cant find it on Youtube.
No.
:D
Mike: no Shizuka doesn't do fanservice heavy
waht

Mike: No. :S
WHY DID HE DO THAT?
Yep.

Not the car! It was so MLG~
B-b-b-b-but i wanna see borderline clean hentai!
otakon: yes :D kinda funny when ya were saying how Shizu doesnt do fanservice at that EXACT moment :D
Mike: bah just get Eiken it'll cure you of that

DrawMotherbucker: not really no
Flashback~
HEEEEEEEYYYYY ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL

Hey Emily_T
AJisHaunter: No matter what, i always read posts that end in '~' with the gay lisp and inflection.
Mike: it's sing song for me when that pops up
13you want fanservice
Oh dear.
13convince the other mods to have me air elfen lied
13you will regret asking for fanservice
Shizuka: YEs
xD
Shizuka: Elfen Lied?
sad
Ppphahaha.
What's Elfen Lied?
Elfen Lied is....an experience
LET'S WATCH FRUITS BASKET!
Of sorts
AJIsHaunter: a very gory anime
CriticKitten: ?
13elfen lied is a series guaranteed to make you hate humans
.........oh my.
Shizuka: like I said, have him see Eiken.. that'll turn him off of fanservice for QUITE a while
EVIL CHICK AHOY!
EVIL?!
EEEEEEEEVIILLLLLL!!
Evil chick needs to stop shedding feathers everywhere
EEEEEVIIIILLL!

Seriously, dropping feathers everywhere is rewd
CriticKitten: She's dirtying up the floor, and I just cleaned it two minutes ago!
/me gives Shizuka a muffin

CriticKitten: wiat what?
CriticKitten: ?

Suisei Seki huh?
damn ads >~<
otakon: She was talking about she'd eat that stuff every day, and they said "the day after tomorrow".
so they call each other by their full names?
oh
CriticKitten: May I ask what that is?
....Gardener's Scissors?
CriticKitten: no idea
I keep forgetting thats a girl
Is....is that a thing? I know some gardeners do have clippers for trimming, but....they're not ordinary scissors right?
why do i keep remembering Zatch Bell everytime i see these dolls?! :D
Sketch_Toku_Brony: bc that show was pretty funny
CriticKitten: SOme use scissors, some use clippers.
13you will recall suiseiseki can travel into dreams and aid the plants that grow there
otakon yeah it was :D
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Zatch Bell was a great show for me. :D
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Boing Boing :P

13because desu
009's manga/writing was done by Shotaro Ishinomori who even wrote and produced the Toku shows still popular in JP such as Kikaider Super Sentai and Kamen Rider,sadly he passed on in 1996-99 due to heart problems :( but i LOVE his artwork and shows to this day :$ there is even an ENTIRE museum in his honor and he won the guiness record for having i think it was over 100,000 pieces of art done :)
desu
Desudesu.
I wish i knew the plot better so i could understand what the hell is going on.
Shizuka: don't summon the Desu
I'm guessing she's sexist?
OH GOD THAT!?
13desu desu desu desu
desu desu desu desu desu desu
....that bird is obnoxious.
OH GOD NO!
Desu

Sketch_Toku_Brony: He has a museum? :O

ITS THE KEYBLADE"S SISTER< SCISSORBLADE!
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Wow.
Shizuka: wait the four of them are supposed to KILL EACH OTHER?
13suiseiseki just loves her sisters more than she wants to play the game
13more than four
Shizuka: okay WHY?
13because plot
EVIL
Shizuka: dammit
She even has pink eyes.
That gets explained right? Why the hell Rozen was such a sadist he made a bunch of dolls into little girls and make them kill one another?
Don't trust her! Don't you believe her! :I
13it's basically highlander
Shizuka: lovely
SHE EVIL
13only one of the dolls gets to live with rozen

I wonder, has Cirque de Freak been adapted to an anime yet? I'd watch the shit out of it.
dolls are horrible demons that watch you as you sleep

HoodyNinja: sweet :3
If Trixie doesn't trust wheels, then neither do I!
thats the spirit hoodi!

Square box thingy!
square box thing is awesome ,i proclaim it my new god!
Toot sonic warrior
No one even cares that she just ran off into the night for no reason
say does anyone know the name of that animated dubstep PMV of Chrysalis? cant remember it :D
An effective way of not having to deal with Trixie later
dont
its dubstep
Smart writers
its bad
HoodyNinja: I was asking myself why too
oh im sur etrixie will be back later at some point
shes still the rival
Buytoast: I could say the same for *insert genre here*
It's not hard :I
Trixie in S3 == Luna in S2
Sketch_Toku_Brony: which one?
Inb4 trixie starves to death in the woods
Polydunami: well not exactly, luna is their ally, trixie i still somewhat of an antagonist
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaQqkypEbuY
I'm heading to bed, night
*is
Polydunami: Only with less screen time and developement
As in, they show up in one episode and are completely forgotten about afterwards.
have no idea why I've been in such a sonic mood lately
luna actually had less screen time
NocturnalBlade: that "Its about to go down,we gonna have a showdown" PMV ya know?
You would know
and about as much development
Give her time, twixie_sprinkle
Oh, nice
ah yes that i know, here Sketch_Toku_Brony http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6OWfUNLFjo
Okay, I lied
Cmc is best ponies
Hi guys, i know it's old but could some1 tell me wht happened during last saturday episode stream?:)
WE GOT HACKED, FOOL
HoodyNinja: No we didn't. :S
BY THE CHINESE
Metronome: you mean the trixie episode?
WORKING WITH AL QUEDA
I mean magic duel stream
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OJ_xo2oTEY
HoodyNinja: that was the one before
Metronome: the embed simply crashed. nothing else.
Metronome: i dont know if we can talk about that...right?
Ok thx i thought it got hacked again?
Not at all, Metronome.
Metronome: Nope.
NocturnalBlade: thanks :) i really liked the editing with this vid plus its not wub the entire time :D it abit but not as much as other vids are :D
You shoulda said saturday not last saturday
It's been over 24 hours, NocturnalBlade
it did
05we didnt get hacked the episode before that either
Easier to understand
oh nvm
05getr your facts straight
oh giod
here we go again
I HAVE SUMMONED THE ALMIGHTY WREK
Sketch_Toku_Brony: no prob, i like the song myself ^_^
Metronome: we got hacked for a bit later that day, but it was intentional to track them
WATCH IN FEAR AS HE DISSAPEARS
NocturnalBlade: ikr :$
k
05how hard is it
Ok ok so it simply crashed or some1 hijacked it?
05to understand
05there
05never
05was
05any
05hack
Wrek, it's too alte
I like that we're watching Jurrasic Park on Friday.
yes technically it wasnt a hack
they'll never learn
05they simply found the keys to the stream the provider had hid under the doormat
13also it wasn't GNAA
got it
13they just want the credit
-_(\ ok hijack not hack
got it
Politically correctness
it was a single person right?
13yes
13who wanted traffic for his own stream
13dead serious
Shizuka: they also made that virus post with the pony tags recently though, but i know that doesnt rove anything
And he got his just deserts.
Did he?
GNAA i mean
13twixie_sprinkle: completely different problem
how desperate do you have to be
Ah wow
13that was a worm that spread via a tumblr vulnerability
13most likely GNAA taking credit for it too
Buytoast: Desperate like me when I haven't eaten in 2 days
Wht are u guys talking about?>_><_<
Oh yeah that, GNAA is taking credit for the tumblr worm thing too
Metronome: theres some virus posts on tumblr
Did mips ever respond?
"It's evil unless I do it."
And I know that wasn't them either
13nope
What tumblr?
13so as professionally as i can say
13fuck mips
lol
hello everypony
Quite
Hai SkunkTauri
Ustream works better IMO
Hi SkunkTauri
13also some dumbass tried to phish our limev details
Hi, SkunkTauri.
Well, the mips era of Bronystate is over.
yup
Mips, you will be missed, even if only by me
what are mips
Mips was a stream provider we used
Miniature Ionized pony Sections
The site has to evolve and adapt so just remember that
It was hijacked.
The streamers used
it's a special stream for the horses
13now we use ustream
/me pokes chat
Thought we used a different stream for FiM in Season 2.
13http://i.imgur.com/tXhTd.jpg
ha!
05besides
The one with Mother 3/NiGHTS filler
05when the single guy found and abused the mips exploit
05isntant response was instant
05when veemi crashed during magic duel
0510 secodns downtime
Gonna make you Smile :) kinda has a jazz feel ya know? so catchy :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8EF6L2Zo8Y&list=FLIWobWFql_3X0c2sKFQCW1Q&index=69&feature=plpp_video
13yes do recall that we experience seconds of downtime at best
05sure is enough to get some people to flip a table
Wrek: lol
what happened?
13but i do appreciate people coming in raising hell like we were down for days
05i dont
People feel insecure
Calm down
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yqflb4xU2Q and suddenly kung fu cutman
b-b-but we're entitled to interruption free viewing on a website
y-y-you big bullies
/me 13sharpens a pool noodle
I have no idea what happened other than GNAA again.
13sigh
05...
I hated that over half of the people watching the show just gave up and left after that one hiccup.
oni_link|egg: Kung Kung Kung Fu Cutman~
05AGAIN?
there is no end
13when will people learn to pay attention or at the VERY least learn to scroll up
05WE JUST WENT THOURGH THIS
there can only be
reoccurances
/me scrolls up
i was there when more then half of the people left
Wait a sec,is that hijacker professional, and is it already dealt with?
PROFESSIONAL
05pfft
ahaha
So pro ;~;
05it was a reg idiot
AJIsHaunter: beep beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep
wht?>_><_<
05regular*
lightIRC doesn't really work too well with scrolling; it freezes up sometimes as a result.
this aint no air force one son
didnt we have almost a thousand viewers?
Polydunami: Yeah, I have that problem too.
aint no special secret internet services guardin the stuff
on the other episode that got hacked
I think we all need to just calm down. :S
Yeah, it's why I decided to get my own IRC client
how about some Pinkie Jazz to cheer us up eh? :$ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8EF6L2Zo8Y&list=FLIWobWFql_3X0c2sKFQCW1Q&index=69&feature=plpp_video
it keeps happening
yup, lets just relax
stop linking that video
05really Shizuka we should compile exactly what we jsut said into a single text
i already disliked it
give me another one
05then copypasta it into the face of the next person that asks
You know someone is going to take the bait
Wrek: we get it Wrek :3
Take what's mine! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzRcIvFU-YM
I think u should post wht exactly happened in the main page
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMcrbfCVdsw
05and if that dont work
Take what's mine ::[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzRcIvFU-YM
05im going to personally fill said askers every orphace with ASCII
lol
It never works Metronome; people come in here to ask questions that can be answered by going to the home page.
All the time
what is ASCII if youdont mind asking?
hey, i actually understood ASCII
basic programming finally paid off
SkunkTauri: its like a letter library
05Metronome: there is a post on the front page
shit i wonder if i still have that print out
05and everyday someoen asks something that c an be answered by the rules and FAQ section
[](/twisquint)
05but people are outright too lazy
I 've seen it but it's not so detail

The voice has been doubled
Luna's gone mad
What if twilight wore the Alicorn Amulet instead of trixie
Hey phase4 did your mouse pointer get bigger all of a sudden?
What if it was Fluttershy? :O
SkunkTauri: What if?
SkunkTauri: well she wouldve gone mad too probably
twixie_sprinkle: ikr :D though ive seen a bunch of Twixie fics even a Colgate/Trixie that was pretty funny,lol Colgate drop giant toothbrush in front of Trixie and w/ wide happy eyes says "Brushie!" :D
What if spriggles wasn't such a big fan boy?
twixie_sprinkle: she will, but at a slower pace
SkunkTauri: why slower?
HoodyNinja: What's wrong with supporting a character?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: yeah i dont really read fics that much :P
AJIsHaunter: :3
twixie_sprinkle: she has more control over her emotions and would slow the corruption
HoodyNinja: eh im not really that much of a fanboy, i just felt like changing it up
twixie_sprinkle: trixie wanted revenge so she got corrupted faster
Oh no, Pinkamena. :D
twixie_sprinkle: oh 6_9 theres some pretty good ones out there like an amazing Luna fic thats nearly finished that made me almost in the recently uploaded chapter :( but really good
SkunkTauri: i guess, altho the final result would be the same, and twilight would be a lot more powerful too and might notve fallen for the trick trixie did
pinkamena
dat Majora's Mask final hours theme
Sketch_Toku_Brony: well ive read two fics, wasnt really impressed with them, but im sure there are better ones out there, just dont have the patience for most of them
jujuuuuuuuuuuuuu

I seem to get the most annoying advertisements with this stream
^
i got adblocker on
but ustream ads have kittens!
HoodyNinja and Polydunami: Adblock?
How?
I knew someone would say something
Polydunami: You can Google it and downoad it.
twixie_sprinkle: ah i see yeah theres thatll get ya hooked :D like Magic in the Stars,Son of the Princess/Son of Chaos,ect. :$
No harm done?
It'll be a Firefox add-on if you're using it.
*theres some
Polydunami: Nope.
damn, someone said something on a public chat? hoodi u r nostradamus :3
Nosferatu~
I think the link to ad block should be featured in our faqs
twixie_sprinkle: I do my best :3
AJIsHaunter: o u nosferatu~

Lira: Are you on coccaine?
0_o
:D
Is this some kind of boss rush where one player is the boss?
Polydunami: It's basically an all vs. one.
Hmm
Someone controls the Pony while the others try to defeat her.
However, the pony/Saxton has a high amount of HP and can kill just about anyone in one hit.
damn
hit you from a mile away
yay
00,02saxtons almost always only have mele
wonder if therell be a Discord or Chrysalis mod? :D
00,02Buytoast, yeah, lag is not a kind mistress
Plus, if the game times out the Pony/Saxton will win.
00,02Sketch_Toku_Brony, theres a chrysalis hale, no discord
Phase4: oh i see
Sketch_Toku_Brony: "You ponies are the most amount of fun I've had in EONS!" XD
And once you're dead, you're out for the game?
Polydunami: Yep, for the round.
AJIsHaunter: :D YES

Hi myself!
00,02asking you to not drink/drive
ah i ihad an ad with kittens
I CAN SEE INTO FOREVER
Wait, does are the ads for this embed? :D
Ohai AJ
*those
/me smashes SpadeKyurem[R] into the wall
It's even worse, Phase4; these ads interrupt the stream.
00,02Polydunami, ah
00,02thats gona be a problem during pony eps
Well anyway..good night
00,02infact thats a problem during anything
I should go to sleep
00,02why would anyone use a streaming service that does that
Night, SpadeKyurem[R]. :)
night SpadeKyurem[R]
i've not experienced ad problems
Phase4: Why not twitch?
yeah, these ustream ads are brutal
only reason i caved for that ad block thing
Polydunami: what browser you use?
HavokOC: Twitch redirects people to a different site for some people who can't access the stream on Bronystate embed.
00,02i got adblock after youtube started making me wait 30 seconds for a 15 second video
Phase4: WHAT?! :D
I use Firefox, but never considered getting adblock.
yeah Fighting is Magic Dash's theme :D
oh shit, ad block works for youtube too?
maybe now you should cause it'll block that ad type
Buytoast: Yep.
well hot damn
mozilla adblock even allows blocking separate flash applications
Is friendly fire on?
i use google chrome
Seems like that is not the case...
00,02yeah, thats the other reason i blocked ads
go go go go go go
00,02soo much bandwidth
hehehe
00,02all wasted
00,02plus it doesnt help when you get video ads, playing, with sound, simultanious with an actual video you want to watch
you cant defeat the great and powerful trixie
G&PT is OP. Nerf now.
so for adblock is it the one for your browser or adblock plus? :$
what song is this?
Its nerf.......or nothing NERF!
lol Moopy
HA!:D
Sketch_Toku_Brony: isnt adblock plus for the browser too?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I think both are for your browser.
So...
Phase4: Have you ever encountered any Spy crabbers on TF2? :D
I like turtles
00,02AJIsHaunter, every now and again
Discuss...
(or however you say that)
:3
00,02i hate the documents folder in windows
HavokPhone: I like trains

Sketch_Toku_Brony: press the firefox icon on the top left and choose addons, and search there

Okay, I'm back and I finally got that adblock plus thing.
D:
HavokPhone: :O *takes off shades* my god
what server is this?
Pinkie is the best pony
wow this Smile remix is catchy :3
theres a site that shows a pic of a kid flipping you off if you have adblock
I prefer Celestia, to be honest :$
Actually dude everypony is the best
oh god Pinkies :O
there are too many pinkie fans here
what we need is more twi/rarity/trixie fans
The models of the ponies look pretty good, at least compared to MLP Heroes
twixie_sprinkle: Nope
i like all the Mane 6 equally ^~^ i cant decide since they all are so daww :D
everytime i hear pinkies smile song, i cant stop smiling
hoodi shaddup, search ur feelings, u kno it 2 be tru
We need more Cmc fans
Pinkie Pie is an awesome pony, I'll give you that much. But I still prefer Celestia/Twilight/Rarity
didnt know they added Chrysalis to PF2
HoodyNinja: i like Sweetie Bell
I prefer Celestia over Luna, to be honest.
AJIsHaunter: LIES
lunar republic ftw!
So... is this server private?
cmc is kewl too ofc
COME ON YOU BASTARDS YOU CAN'T LOSE TO HER
HoodyNinja: Nope.
00,02Dr_Fumbles, pirate?
00,02oh
00,02private
00,02no
lol there needs to be a Colgate w/ the Brushie song as her theme :D
00,02i misread
lol
What server is it?
best villain in my opinion is discord
PFft
yep
Tom is best villain
Discord will always be best villian
Discord made tom
PFft?
inb4 Mandark laugh Ha haha ha haha ha ha haha! :D
discord is probably best, although im not nuts over his voice
^ yeah
element of chaos and disharmony
*spirit, my bad
His voice is the best part ;~;
meh ive heard better voices
Poke
rarity has best voice in mlp
^
i wonder how discord wouldve sounded if he was voiced by Robin Williams or Gilbert Godfried :D
Phase4 play with me
mrbean.jpg
John de lancie is the best discord :)
twixie_sprinkle: indeed :D love her lip pout she does,so daww
/me slaps JRP2234 around a bit with a large trout
00,02magnet boots
imo trixie has a neat voice too, altho it was a bit off in the last ep
They all have good voices
wtf is this game mode, everyone vs ponies?
Pip has best accent
youre right about that HoodyNinja :)
THe models look so good
pfft, british accent, overrated as hell
twixie_sprinkle, D:
^
Pfft twixie, overated as hell
Chrysalis: Saxton, just with Ponies.
HoodyNinja: So is Luna.
OMG awesome cover http://soundcloud.com/radiohooves/already-one-year
Metronome, please, no non-image links during streams
^
???
It's not a video
Metronome, read it agian >.>
AJIsHaunter: Could say the same for Celestia :I
all ponies are overrated! :D
HoodyNinja: Celestia is overrated? :S
mlp is overrated, it sucks and its fake and gay
Metronome, Non-image meaning everython except image
twixie_sprinkle, ikr >_>

Chrysalis: Yep.
Chrysalis: yup
i didnt till last night
twixie_sprinkle, wat XD
Chrysalis: YUP
rather interesting supprise
i believe its called training toothpase, dafuq is dat anyway
no idea
toothpaste you can swallow I think
but its really tasty
twixie_sprinkle: Training+Toothpaste?
WHAT.
TRAINING TOOTHPASTE.
ah ok jcelios that would make sense
man this a crazy match :D
/me hugs chat
I wish i could play...
I wsh my computer had the capabilities to play this game. :D
same here
twixie_sprinkle: 0_o thats horrifying :D
AJIsHaunter, solution: duct tape + rockets
*wish
My computer is so damn slow
a toaster could play TF2 on lowest settings can't it?
like a turtle
AJIsHaunter: Beat the fuck out of it
yu
WUBS
I liek wubs
jcelios: Provided said toaster can hold +10 GB and has a decent graphics card and processing speed.
also, there are tools to turn the settings even lower than the menus allow
There is no computer that cannot play it
hell even my old netbook could play it
Ah, I remember my old netbook.
hey the moon!
you dont need a good gfx card
Good times, good times. :<
Play TF2 without any textures XD
just enough storage for all the hats
This is a good song
Guys.. Far cry 3 is amazing. I cant believe the improvement from 2 to 3
o cool a stratch skin rofl
00,02poor engi
Malmortius: i wanna get that! how is it so far?
Farcry 2 was complete and utter repetitive shit. Far cry 3 is pretty damn amazing. HOW?
I wonder why the hats cost more than the weapons themselves in terms of purchasing even though the hats are usually cosmetic.
Its pretty damn exciting Sketch
supply and demand
and crazy people
Constant skirmirs all over the map. I just ran out of ammo and i had to sneak around and avoid the guys driving around in cars
Malmortius: i heard its the Skyrim of shooters
and then a tiger attacked me ;p
wubwubwub
/me ROCKS TO THE BEAT
Stupid comparison, alot of people have been saying that just for convenince sketch
They're nothing like :l
Well that was eventful
Its better to compare to something like.. well, far cry 2 lol
or just cause
Great game up to now though
Malmortius: ah i see :) well one said that in a review so i wouldnt know lol that and ive never played Skyrim :D but Farcry 3 looks awesome
Holy crap, look at all these players on the red team
And they go down quickly
So is that rainbows awesome rock and roll music?
I think with the comparison to skyrim people are saying, its a giant open world with lots to do. thats about the only similarities
lol they need to make red team ALL Pinkie going "Fun! Fun! Fun!" :D
And in Farcry 3 they somehow made the funs extremely satisfying to shoot
Special attack! DRYING PAINT!
D:
the pinkie clones kinda creep me out
Gtg :c
Not sure how, they dont have alot of recoil or whatnots. they're just.. super fun.
Cya
Hey whats the name of that awesome music i want to look it that up later
Bye, HavokOC.
Is.. is that fucking rainbow dash in TF2?
Bye HavokOC
latas Havok
Malmortius: You'd be right.
Malmortius: wow i want it even more~! :D hows the story?
so far anyway.
I thought i wouldnt like it sketch, but its incredibly well done for an open world. The opening scene has you escapign with your military buddy from slave traders, basically.
you are a pussy to begin with, lol. your character that is, hes just a normal guy.
Malmortius: oh yeah! that Vaas guy huh? ive seen previews of him and he sounds all F:[KED up :D
Hm? I can't hear the stream.
pony_8482: Check the volume on the embed.
Vaas is crazy insane. I thought i wouldnt like a character like that, they always seemed forced but with this guy.. you generally believe hes insane lol
like... Joker insane?
The reason you escape is because after your escape attempt he says "i admire that, now fucking run while we shoot at you!"
And theres helicopters and dogs and shit chasing you XD
and your guys like "ohshitohshitohshit"
Malmortius: :D thats crazy!
It's set for Max, but my comp's audio bars only show barely 10% of the audio bar detecting audio.
Its terrifying and insane
Cant believe they included a semi-Rpg skill system to it too
at least killed someone
Malmortius: did ya see the live action thing w/ the VA? He's like Vaas INCARNATE :D
K, well, I needs some sleeps. Latas Bstate
Bye, HoodyNinja.
3 talent trees, and most of the talents are really, really useful. Like being able to pull around guys after you assassinate them
Good night, HoodyNinja
Goodnight HoodyNinja
cya HoodyNinja
Malmortius: wait. what game are you talking about?
/me flies away to his bread in the sky
wats with the PHP stuff
Far Cry 3, I believe
Farcry 3 Pinkies4thwall
yep
Oh.
Carry on
Cant believe the drastic change from Farcry 2 to 3. because farcry 2 was utter shit.
Every aspect is improved, especially the story
God Farcry 2...
Oh, it was a headphone problem. Not my comp or the stream. Nevermind.
00,02brb
yep... farcry 2, game that takes 10 shots from an automatic rifle to kill anyone
That was game was so boorrrring /).(\
Oi guy, kill this camp for some diamonds, ok now kill this camp for some diamonds
*Phone rings*
"Oi help me kill this camp so you can kill this camp easier"
hallo AdamTheDuck
Everyone here knows about that Mayan Calender thing, right? A family member saw a show about the Mayan Calender in the Discovery Channel awhile back. Apparently more Mayan Calender stuff was found recently. The 'End of the World' calender is actually a calender that leads to the date of a Mayan Ceremony. This was evidenced by more calenders found that function past the 'End of the World' calender.
/me flips table
DED
Dat wall
Snake!!!
Ohai taoumi
/me licks taoumi :3
Farcry 2 is like, heres a giant world and a gun, go kill some guys. Farcry 3 is like, heres a giant island and a gun and hunting and minigames and high quality combat and crafting and looting and purchasing and exploring. go have fun.

Hello MahBoi777

Hi, MahBoi777. :)
I can't wait for the rioting, pony_8482
Because it WILL happen
Finally i think games are mosing away from the muddy, dusty gritty realism shit.
awww that's cute. i'm working on the manes for lunas. the hard part is over now i jsut need to put the pieces togeather :3
moving*
Due to a lack of information.
Thank god I don't have to work on the 21st
pony_8482: really? :D bet those idiots on Doomsday Prepper are kicking themselves in the junk for teaching their kids to eat bugs and what not :D
That would be chaotic
/me pokes Pinkies4thWall
This thread is now about....
MAHBOI
Air raid sirens on the 21st?
/me hugs MahBoi777
/me hugs Pinkies4thWall back tight :)
Polydunami: ALL THE AIR RAIDS
Oh hey, MahBoi777
Is this a stream from the Friendship is All talk? The one with the VS Ponyvill?
hey Polydunami, how have you been?^^
AFKed, what is going on here? :/
Not too bad

Pinkies4thWall: awesome lol
Hide and Seek? What's next, Pin the Tail on the Pony? :S
SPOILERS. 12/21/12 is the end of the world AS WE KNOW IT. We will all actually be transported to equestria.
EVIL VENT FROG
I guess I'll join that server. I'm Shadow.
does Equestria have internet?
I dunno if that would be a good thing or a bad thing. Even though it's EQUESTRIA.
^depends on internet
jcelios: who cares/
PONIES
no internet? D:
Equestria has PONIES
I would think that would be the least of your agenda
I suppose I could live off ponies
Frickin' PONIES, bro
Why would you need Internet when you have magic all around you?
If we all did voiped to Equestria, it'd probably be just like District 9.
lol
Would you be turned into a pony yourself?
Polydunami: by the grace of Celestia herself, one would have a choice.
Pinkies4thWall: u broke it AGAIN
If it meant being able to use unicorn magic I probably would
wipergone2: you expected otherwise?
00,02stealth phase
earth or pegi... I'd miss hands
phase
hit the frog
it is looking at you funny
Stealth Phase is best Phase
pony_7268: He's locked into position. He can't move.
so?
you can still hit it
So he can't hit the frog.
/me implodes
Even if he could, it would give his position away.

Cereal is canon?

Sweetie burns everything
even water
Hope we get more AJ and Rarity episode this season.
If not, maybe later seasons.
PUPPY
I use Firefox. I was told it was better than IE.
I'm hoping for a more Applejack-centric episode.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #515
Dammit, I've watched too much LOST. I'm calling them centric episodes -_(\
true, we need more rarity and and aj eps, and less yellow horse eps
Ooooooh, so you're ~CosmicObserver AJIsHaunter :$
AdamTheDuck: :$
huh?
Now who the hell is Razaza? 6_9
Fluttershy is a backgroun pony, of course she won't get any episodes
>:(
RawketLawnchair: that would be nice
I'd actually like to see more of the princesses in later seasons.
well considering the whole book thing they will probably play a big role in one more this season
AJ's singing VA will be gordon freeman :3
Me too, actually
twixie_sprinkle: XD
bye everypony
bye wipergone2
Also, I would not mind Derpy having more speaking lines.
Bye, wipergone2. :)
AJIsHaunter: Probably gunna get to see Celestia, because who gives a damn about Luna
bye wipergone2

Bye wipergone2
RawketLawnchair: I don't mind Luna, but I prefer Celestia more.
See you, wipergone2
AJIsHaunter: cosmic observer?
I can see why people love Luna so much, but I don't like her as much as Celestia.
00,02waiting is boring
twixie_sprinkle: Yep. dA name. :)
AJIsHaunter: a ok
Phase4: No. It's the best part.
Hey phase4 what do you have to do in that game map?
most of the luna love seems to be fanon stuff
And all her fanon is 'abloo bloo bloo so sad ;_;
Ok guys, i think i shall go hit the hay :) thanks for the streams as always and see yall later ^_^

Phase4: i had no idea mechanical engineering took so much programming
I can understand comparing Celestia to Trollestia as a comedic joke. But when you actually believe that she's a troll princess? That's when there's a problem.
celestia suks, i vote trixie for new princess :|
I appear to have a huge boil or something on my back.
eew
lance it
Pinkies4thWall: Ouch. You should get that checked out, mate.
ewwwww gross dude
It hurts
Pinkies4thWall: Have you seen a doctor about it?
it's affecting my sleep
:(
Pinkies4thWall: Yeah, you should see a doctor about it if it's affecting your sleep.
It's about the size of a nickel

hi all
Hi, Mutterguy.
Hey there, Mutterguy_
* Mutterguy_
Derpy's Rage reminds me of the Mushroomization status ailment from Earthbound. Except eaiser to counter.
yeah I think I left my IRC running back on my PC...
Ah yes, Earthbound. How I love that game.
Wait. is phase speaking?
Yep, I got that when I was a kid. That was when the game was released.
No, you would recognize his voice
does the voice sound australian?
What I find stupid is that I was in a bookstore this summer and I found a copy of the game. But they told me that it was "Display Only". :I
Kinda
Well, it is a really rare game.
so then eyjey killed them all and took the game, the end
Well, not stupid. Maybe inconvinient. Poor choice of words there. My apologies.
twixie_sprinkle: What? D:
AJIsHaunter: where did you hide the bodies, huh?? dont think you can hide them forever :|
But I didn't do anything. ;~;
liar!
;^;
you just confessed!
I'd donate to that server to be able to choose what boss I'd be, but I'm poor.
twixie_sprinkle: I did it! I took the boots! They're here, under the floorboards!
[03:31:36] <AJIsHaunter> you're right, it was me all along. but you'll never find the bo- oh, wow, i dont even need to forge this fake confession anymore
WHAT?! :D
>_>
I find it funny that I do more damage as a KGB Heavy on that server than a Heavy with a Minigun.
Liarjack, EF BEE EYE
twixie_sprinkle and AJIsHaunter :D did walk in on you 2 playing LA Noire? :D
Sketch_Toku_Brony: <_<
:D
Except against a knife boss. They always one shot.

Do I seriously have the latest time here?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: IM SO ALONE!
Goodness sake
/me hugs AppleBloom
So how much damage does a non crit from Pinkimena do? I was overhealed and died. Normally it takes two hits.
/me yawns
00,02pony_8482, no idea
00,02lots
Yeah, some bosses take atleast two hits to kill me as a overhealed Heavy. Sometimes one shot.
00,02raven makes for a terrifying pinkamena
00,02berrypunch y u timeout
And I heard a KGB Heavy gets a defense boost.
00,02huh
00,02so theres a reason berry is dying
00,02vps went
Nope.avi XD
00,02i might need to change providers again
00,02getting sick of doing that
Still, I got over 500 damage in before I was turned into a cupcake.
Anyway, Pinkimena is not that scary. But a mix of Pinkimena and Kinkie Pie would be a REAL terror.
is that..spy's arm?
Goodness, that would be a sadomasochistic nightmare
Yep, twixie_sprinkle.
wow
and its all rotten too..
and its still moving somehow >.<
twixie_sprinkle: The scout has a weapon with a fish wrapped in a newspaper. XD
Sketch_Toku_Brony: thanks sketch, sorry I would have replied sooner but was playing guitar lol

Sketch_Toku_Brony: there's a lot of things you dont know about me, I would tell you them... But then i'd have to kill ya. :)
bronies kill ponies in their free time

AJIsHaunter: yeah i remember dat :D
I think it's supposed to be used mainly as a embarass kill or a shame kill. :D
yeah like knifing in counter strike i guess
inb4 one of them Spycrabs XD
ive killed so many show offs who tried to knife me
After a round is over as a Changling, I tend to Spycrab as one.

MLP movie to be released in the theatres. Good idea or bad? Discuss
Depends on how well-written it would be.
Farcry 3 man... farcry 3.. It might just be my game of the year.

Silent Hill TF2 edition.
So TF2 has rat-maps, too O.o
AppleBloom, It would be very good to see a well writen and designed MLP movie, but ive always thought of a movie that is made off a series to be used as the series closer or final, so i wouldnt really like there to be one.
AbsoluteZero: I agree to a certain extent, but, most other shows dont have a following like this one does.
very true
'Tavi :3
I'd certainly like to see a characterisation for Octavia.
AppleBloom: if i wanted an mlp movie made i would want it to be like Space Jam but 20% cooler :D
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Michael jordan should play as big Mac
00,02hmmm
00,02wonder if i should pick a boss
You want to take a stab at it?
Guess you have to give up on adventuring now.
AppleBloom: lol i meant the ponies bring Lauren Faust to their world :D but that could work too
A wild advertisement appeared *clicks run* You can;t escape
Phase4 do some old dos game for onestream and recive a cookie
Sketch_Toku_Brony: have the voice of bugs bunny be celestia since bugs bunny is best troll
00,02AppleBloom, terrible pun XD
AppleBloom: oh god i can hear it now :D
Too bad; Mel Blanc is long dead.
00,02i was going to say 'Loki v Pinkie pie, write it now' but i've read that one
INORITE? it made me laugh though
I still don't understand the Lottery, how can Hot Fuzz be an A, but Brother Bears is apperantly a B movie? How is this accurate?
Perhaps have luna as daffy?
Trollestia banishes Luna to the moon for 1,000 years "Of course you know.. this means war"

Polydunami: perhaps if you helped us come up with ideas, we could make it a good idea
I would, but I don't remember very much of Space Jam
Hmm
So what, do we still have a human basketball player as the main character?
Or whatever sport we'd have here
Polydunami: I dont know o.O What would be the considered sport of equestria? Horseshoes?
jousting?
I think there may have been at least one basketball seen in the show

Nopp
Deeeeeeaaaaaaaaad.
there was a person playing a mlp game on her kindle.. she wouldnt let me play ;_;
meanie
MadSurge: That's such a cute message. :>
I could see Pinkie saying that, too. ^_^
i shoulda took her ipod at lunch one time >.>
to teach not to leave it at table
or it could get stolen
I would NEVER leave something that expensive unattended.
Gold_Demona: apparently it's a Bob Ross quote, but it fits Pinkie too :3
i would take and hide in my pocket or something
she had me watch it
she lucky i stayed at table with it >.>
MadSurge: *nods* Yeah, I could see Bob Ross saying that too.
MadSurge: That sounds like something he'd say. :D
i have my my ds in a drawer, in a box at work
so it stayed safe :>
Ohai
last time it went in a box for safekeeping
i have to convert all the doom 2 midis to mp3
Brb
Good luck with that
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/f6c013eb155f9ce115be5e8ccd41b79b.png Remember when Applebloom and Sweetie Belle masqueraded as their bigger sisters? :D
i smart with my things right?
have them hide or put them in drawer while at work
i keep my ipod in my pocket
Although JRP2234. I HAVE mp3s of a lot of the midis in Doom 2.
Gold_Demona: good music :)
Yesh :>
yes but im useing a sound font
a sound font that makes it sound good
a 250mb sound font
Ah. So more like remixing
unlike her.. im super protective of my eletronics
Gold_Demona i hacked doom 2 into the ios app
Heh!
Vivix, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoxRxGHYTsg :P
/me listens
one sec
Cuz the MP3s I have are of the songs the way they originally sounded. It's pretty cool. :>
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A9Q11h1CIAAOaib.jpg:large
Vivix, oh crap you sent me Explosions in the Sky, sorry wasn't paying attension to chat at the time :$
hehe

heres the screen
Vivix, yup :3
woop :3 s nice
I remember I used to have a MASSIVE collection of midis.
I love the dreamy roomy sound of music like this- never heard on hour before the trip, before
"Dreamy" yeah that's a nice word to describe the kind of music I like :3
Frekin hippy.
the old sounding mp3 rips might be useful if you had the ipad render the game in its softwear redering
Ohai Jmo
Oh shush Jmo :3
/me sneaks behind Jmo and gives him a good ol' hug :3
ill upload a vid of it

MadSurge, the thing with ustream is that it pops up an ad during the stream
HavokPhone, and that can be avoided with adblock+
HavokOC: not with adblocker and Chrome :D
I mean HavokPhone
Ik, but not everyone got adblocker :P
HavokPhone: for Chrome it's free
HavokPhone, but everyone should get it
it's free for every browser
I know >.<
So the only excuse for not having it is laziness. :P
:O
But for example, during pony stream

Surely it would have been more tactically sound to hide by the sides of the door as opposed to in the open several feet from it.

i dont know how i got sick, but im pretty sure Sumica had something to do with it
LOL:D
That's pretty sweet actually. Too bad they cost so much to unlock.
Alot easier to type here than that stupid iphone yesterday

So what're they going to do with sea monsters?
I didn't quite get it.

gonna get on my shoes
You haven't by any chance played Super Filly Adventure, have you?
All the characters live happy usually except Luna
GTG. Bye everypony
It seems overpowered?
Whereas they can drop you in about two quick pops.
This is Halo + Star Wars in my opinion.
I play NC, so I can't really say how they handle, but they have an advantage in rapid fire. Thing is they don't hit as hard, so it's sort of counterbalanced.
05^ its the opposite really
It's like being pecked to death by pigeons.
Gold_Demona: want some more of the yummy cake me? :D
No thanks, aniderp|bestcakeever. I'm full :P

Hiyo HavokOC
Wb HavokOC!
Hello
Gold_Demona: I "made" a surprise for fluffeh :3c
Oh? :>
h
Gold_Demona: http://i.imgur.com/SpCrZ.png her OC drawn by Momogirl :3
How cute! =D
Gold_Demona: she was so happy :)
08,01had a bit of a river tam moment just now
08,01my mum was making us some sandwiches, and she had two piles of bread
08,01she took one pile, and put it on the other
08,01so i said "it's a stack"
08,01she looked at me and said "what?"
08,01i pointed to the bread, "it's a stack!"
08,01she gives me that sympathetic look that mothers give, "yes dear, it is"
08,01"you pushed 2 pieces of bread onto the stack"
08,01"what?"
08,01"if you have another stack", i put my hand out, "you can pop from that stack onto the second stack," start transferring bread to a pile in my hand, "and they'll be in reverse order"
08,01"what are you doing?"
08,01bread is now in reverse order on my hand
08,01"see! reverse!"
08,01and i put the bread back on the plate
Nah he's a mod
^
Also newbie how do you know about that?
08,01i then start wandering off into the living room, then call back to her "of course, it's more interesting if it's numbers!"
Zawan: But it's a really boring story.
eh
08,01go on then
08,01you tell us a more interesting one
otakon17: I've seen you get removed by it.
08,01we're all years
Many, many times.
Well.
08,01pony_021222: the channel is muted and you have the stage
Alright then.
This is a story all about how
Where was Gondor when that was incredibly dull?
LOL XD
xD
Rofl.
:D
lel
That's how we handle nubs
Lol
So I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there.
Wb random pony
He was right though, that nearly put me to sleep.
Ohai pony_021222, welcome to bronystate. Where mods can do whatever they want :D
Meanwhile: thanks bro, nice to be appreciated.
08,01anyhoos, i went back into the kitchen and said, "it's more interesting if the bread is numbers"
HavokOC: Tell them I said 'Seig Heil'.
I've got to be honest, no one cares about the bread.
It's always about the numbers isn't it?
pony_021222: k
08,01so she gives me the 'you are absolutely crazy' look, and says "i don't know if what you just said is something very clever, or somethign very stupid"
No one is riveted to their seat with anticipation about the result of the bread story.
The NUMBERS
It just isn't very interesting.
08,01pony_021222: right in the Fuhrer's face?
lol
I love that song. :D
08,01Meanwhile: well, no-one else is talking
08,01or rather, was
Noone's forcing you to listen Meanwhile :|
08,01otakon17: aye
Dammit
I was interested in the bread story :<
MadSurge if you want to kiss ass do it the old fashioned way, on your knees quietly.
Stupid iPod chat won't autoscroll
You do?
You've never struck me as the egotistical type.
An inappropriate weirdo, but never an egotist.
08,01so you think my rampantly innuendous jokes *aren't* a cry for attention?
08,01mercy me
Meanwhile: Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed?
It's that self awareness that causes the image to paint itself this way.
Oh lotd
08,01but maybe it just means i have no modesty either
Lord*
I dunno who this Meanwhile guy is, but he seems like a pretty righteous dood.
It's a good thing, really. Makes you not look like a pillock.
/me scoots back on her pillow
hi
Ohai AssaultWithEmbraces :)
Ohai AssaultWithEmbraces :3
Hello AssaultWithEmbraces
AssaultWithEmbraces: Do you know AttacksWithHugs?
Same person.
Can't tell if serious.
Oh
I hope so.
/me hugs MadSurge, HavokOC, otakon17
Hah.
I
/me hugs back
I had a moment there
Silly otakon17 :3
I'm gonna get a coffee
It basically says AttackWithHugs, just in a, uh, friendlier way?
That's your way of making it look friendlier?
Clinical terms makes it look sterile.
It just makes you look like a bit of a rapist, tbh.
Oi. Keep shit like that out.
08,01next, it will be RapeWithCarresses
:D
MolestWithGropings.
it somebody say 'rape'?
nope.avi
oh
wheres Gold_Demona thingy
Thingy? O.o
08,01DefileWithCuddles
Congratulations Gold, you're a thingy.
Uhhhhhhhhhh
I'm a thingy!~ 8D
I belive 'thingy' is the correct term.
08,01AssaultWithEmbraces: heh, sorry, maybe i got a bit too carried away there...
Yey~ \8D/
Great, now my name makes me look like a serial killer. Did not expect that
Lol
http://phlim2.tumblr.com/post/36874268989/brbshittoavenge-etonia-lessthangrace
Made me lol
Well, at least randomly hugging is better than just straight out stabbing someone in the face with a rusty kitchen knife
Yes, because hugs are such a terrifying weapon :D
I'M A MENACE!
/me goes into hiding
/me hugs AssaultWithEmbraces
:3
HavokOC: This is...random.
yup
Don't touch me, I'm taaaaainted ;`;
Oooh
Oh
I sense ban
Oooooh
And the world, for that matter.
^
^^
And that's you haven't changed you nick?
Speaking of which, I met a brony on the street on the way home today.
This Jmo guy has the right idea.
Aussie, Brit shut it
How about no?
Awesome, Kammerjunk
He had purdy crystal toys.
Kammerjunk: >Bronies
>going outside
Well I never.
Not without trailing spaghetti.
I go outside with a Derpy shirt, hat and phone charm. No spaghetti anywhere. Just chocolate muffins.
pony_021222: Most of us have orders from the police to stay inside.
And idiot drives
drivers*
So pony_021222 what brings you here then to a site which is SPECIFICALLY called Bronystate?
/me hugs pony_021222 :3
otakon17: So I can see what you fags talk about, probably.
He wants to troll bronies, I guess.
Why do I have the feeling that pony_021222 is someone who frequents this place? Or am I losing it?
I dunno, being mad at bronies is so 2011.
/me gives pony_021222 a muffin
pony_021222 is a silly filly
pony_021222: I'll have you know I'm neither a small bundle of sticks or a cigarette
That's right.
I am a cigarette.
You're a potato.
I'm a spud...
Joy
lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTW8_PgzMjk
otakon17: I thought you were a baguette.
pony_021222, u not tolerate mothef~
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AHx4Xz5Jqo&list=FLCrJ6Rah3q2YaUhrS9gWLcg&index=3&feature=plpp_video
/me tries to ponder the concept of pony cigarettes...
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A9R-SIyCUAIFBFq.jpg:large i did nothing to the menu <_<
pony_021222: :/ how do you know that?
pony_3045: Say that one more time.
I dare you.
I double dare you motherfucker.
How dare you? :[
Double Dare was a pretty good game show.
^
Wait a minute... BaconMane?
BaconMane? Where?
So, pony_021222, who are you actually?
Meanwhile: Now let's think for a second.
^
If I was someone you knew, hypothetically.
You'd be Elsie.
What do I gain out of telling you who I am?
Nothing, on account of I'm not attempting to benefit you in any manner.
Yeah
...E-peen?
By remaining under a cloak of anonymity I'm deliberately avoiding revealing my identity to you to create some kind of aura of mystery.
Meanwhile benefits no one
Meanwhile is part of a complete breakfast.
It's true, the world would be a better place without me in it.
Thanks otakon.
If you genuinely, really want to know who I am though.
lol
night people

Night JRP2234|Zzz
pony_021222, DONT LET ME SEE YOU ON MY﻿ PONYLAN AGAIN!1

Lies.
You cannot be Tacowiz.
Lol
:O
Aura of mystery? Where?
Dun dun duuuunnnnnnnn
I WILL NOT LET YOU BE TACOWIZ.
Dun dun dun!
Search your feelings, Meanwhile.
You know it to be true
Tacowiz is the most unforgivable of chatgoers, but only dari'd be aware of that.
doom2
zzz
Lol
Unforgivable?
Well, Imma go shower. brb peeps
Just joking.
Tacowiz abandoned bs long ago
Of course you are, Tacowiz is dead.
As did I.
I hate to admit it, but now I'm intrigued.
But I've returned.
no stream?
And you might be intrigued as to how I know so much, how I seem so knowledgeable about the site.
Go to bread, JRP2234|Zzz.
Though chances are if that's true, I probably won't remember you anyway.
No stream
no stream?
Maybe it's because I've been around a while.
No, you're lying.
Maybe it's because I'm someone who no longer comes here.
Maybe it's because I'm infamous.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAZDY3b_TG0 look at what i did to doom
maybe i'm taco
Ok Elsie now you're trying too hard.
^
emangamer: You're a phony!
Anyway I'm out for now
Bbl, take care
Later otakon17!
/me goes to get breakfast

You'll never receive that from him.
you don't want to live long I figure VioletGreySha
So Meanwhile!
Take your best guess.
/me hits Meanwhile with a large trout
Elsie, now you're /really/ trying too hard.
* Vivix
Give me your best shot.
SpeccyRush, well, it would be a nice way to go

/me is a potato
Meanwhile: hey
AssaultWithEmbraces: :D
You're aware I can monitor the name changes Elsie?
:)
wipergone2: What.
lol
/me hits Meanwhile with a large trout
/me hits wipergone2 with a brick.
ow
Meanwhile: Of course.
/me dies
I have to inquire Elsie, exactly what hallucinogens did you take that made you decide all this was a good idea?
After all, I know you must have a client or are at least using the IRIS IRC, only dumb dumbs use the built in lightIRC.
Meanwhile: Who said I was Elsie?
I'm assuming you are, regardless of what you say.

Hello universe and all who inhabit it.
Hi pony_840009
How do you change your name?
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
/nick ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
pony_840009: Use /nick [nickname]
pony_840009: What you need to do is hold down the Alt key
Then press F4.
lol
That is the most legitimate of advice.
No
I know that trick.
Lucid: lolumad?
I'm not an idiot.
it closes ur program
wipergone2: Now I am.
Lucid that 'trick' is older than the internet
Mostly because stupidity incenses me.
So is 'delete system32'
And yet it does still work sometimes.
Stupid only pisses off the ignorant
how could u say oOo
And it's those times that it's gold.
Well did everyone see the new episode?
yep
fuck u trixie
Stupid makes me not want to go back to school for IT and computer science
Did you like it?
yup
Alright everyone! Goodbye!
Shizuka go back to bread
>_>
Vivix: And, y'know, the people who don't like people with the mental age of 7 year olds and find the caps lock key to be the most interesting thing in the world.
bronystate not talks about ponies, silly
I don't care
Vivix: That much is evident.
Well, that was a shortlived visit.
Meanwhile: lolhi

So is the troll still here? O_o

Meanwhile: so who was that loser?
What makes you think I know?
AssaultWithEmbraces: is tht on tht server
:)
What am I, the keeper of stupid?
Meanwhile: :D
Am I the chat's chronicler of idiocy?
wipergone2, what? I have no clue what you're saying.
Do I record every instance of dumb that crosses my path?
AssaultWithEmbraces: tht pony server with phase4
If I did I'd be too busy to say anything.
Meanwhile: we should do so we can guess who's the dumbest troll ever
wipergone2, I'm not sure. You'd have to ask him yourself.
08,0115:54 < Meanwhile> Shiggydiggydoodad.
08,01quite.
i think its on tht server
08,01Meanwhile: you could just leave the chat if you don't like it so much
You could diggy the shiggy daa doo.
08,01when it's too stupid in here, i just go to xkcd's irc channel
08,01not you in particular
Probably more than you realise.
well not according to Meanwhile :D
08,01but yeha, it often gets vapidly asinine in here
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Episode 10 Synopsis Revealed

I think what Meanwhile is trying to say in as nice a way as possible is that this channel has the combined brain power of a crippled fruit fly with downs syndrome.
I wasn't trying to be nice but that's a fairly apt metaphor.

Sorry, that was my cat.
Dat wall of numbers
That's why my keyboard slides in.
pony_6699 It's ok
:)
So tell me, all of you.
What is it about this puerile, infantile little girl's show that attracts you so much?
And more importantly, why do you find it acceptable to masturbate to the protagonists of said show?
I doubt what I say will change your opinion of anything, so it's the little girls.
>implying every brony finds horses sexy
lel
Surely there must be some small part of you that hasn't been entirely blocked up with year old Italian food.
Nay, imploring you, screaming at you that what you're doing is wrong?
Immoral?
Um... wut?
Sorry, I can't hear you over the fact that I don't touch myself to pastel-colored horses
^
I like Italian food. Not so much the pizzas, though. But they're alright, I suppose.
I return from my shower to find that the topic of chat hasn't changed at all. ¬_¬
Utterly deplorable and more depraved than the entire furry fandom?
I like lasagna. It's delicious
Welcome back Gold_Demona :)
Yup. That's me. As depraved as they come.
Furries are understandable, to a degree.
I don't masturbate to ponies
lol
They are anthromorphised to some degree.
:$
And yet with these... horses.
LucidDreaming: It's really your own fault for believing /mlp/.
>implying furries are just the hypersexualized ones
^
^^
Disney is full of furries but noone says anything about them
Implying /mlp/ isn't a totally accurate portrayal of the fandom.
That is all they are, stylized horses.
Well DUH
They walk on all fours, they eat fucking hay, they snort, they gallop.
Meanwhile: A big part of it, possibly.
So why is it that they are considered spank bank material?
Hey, I snort all the time.
Kammerjunk: Cocaine doesn't count/.
Why do you ask us, ask /mlp/
Hell, I wouldn't know where to find cocaine.
>implying most of you don't go on /mlp/
I don't.
I don't
>implying MLP isn't an entirely accurate representation of this pathetic cesspool of a fandom
I avoid the horror that is FourChan
I stay away from 4chan entirely :S
I already said that.
I tried seeing what /mlp/ is like. I don't get it.
Don't steal my material.
Meanwhile: Good for you, I don't see why you're acting so high and mighty.
You still frequent a channel that these pathetic fuckers dwell in.
Wasn't aware I was, don't see why you are.
Festering in their own bullshit and filth.
Somebody's upset.
Meanwhile is already capable of criticizing us, we don't need someone else :D
:D
That's true. But frankly I do so because I cling to the vain hope that I'll load it up and it'll be like it was when it started.
Alas, I find myself frequently disappointed.
Things always change
Meanwhile: What's the point? Mane chat went down the shitter a long time ago.
Was there ever any doubt?
All that remains now is a few of the original people from the original BronyState.
It really did, but frankly you've brightened my day.
Most of the people who made it great have vacated as it is.
Which made it even better
Vivix: You amuse me.
That's the point, isn't it? You're bored, I'm not
I am bored, this download is taking forever :I
Watchu dl'ing?
Whatcha downloading?
I am bored, I can't think of anything to do.
Downloading the new Skyrim DLC o3o
Ah~~
I never completed Skyrim. Did a bunch of side stories, then got bored.
there's only two of the original founders left.....NewDCD and Ghosties........
My internet is awful though :c
I thought DCD was gone?
Nope.
Both of whom are absent 90% of the time.
Still pops in now and again.
Huh
Skyrim, egh.
Nope, he comes and goes
Vivix: He pops in from time to time :)
Kammerjunk: /mlp/ =/= MLP FIM?
Ah
Dark92Enigma-: /mlp/ is a board of 4chan.
dari is still here, but fuck knows if he pays any attention.
Hm?
Barely.
Holy shit.
Ha
Kammerjunk: oh. i never go to 4chan, so i don't know how it affects the fandom
Meanwhile: OOOOOOOOOOH
Meanwhile: Now you f***ed up! :D
Oh you are alive dari, hey.
Ohai
It's the little pretty princess.
Howsit going dabi?
Not bad, how about you gaymoo?
Tell me Dark92Enigma- exactly how underwhelmed are you by the way that went?
I'm good.
You enjoying running around in a tutu and waving your fairy wand around?
I'm having an absolute whale jaymoo
That's a good lad.
Mayjoo dabi is the best princess, you don't even know.
Oh I bet he is.
Meanwhile: good question.......when i came down here, the chat was going full speed, because it was basically one of the few streams running. Now that there's like 9 streams, and more people frequent those ones, less people come here, and even with 112, there isn't that much to talk
Meanwhile: 100+
I...was actually talking about the "OOOH Now you fucked up" comment but yippadeedoodah.
Meanwhile: OOOOOOH. that comment :D
Dark92Enigma-: That's because, and this is an unfortunate fact, mane chat has simply had a rather sharp decline in quality.
It used to be great.
Thats a bit rude
Exactly, whoever you are.
I know thousands here who can attest to that.
MLP_Brovakiin: It's also a bit true.
The truth hurts.
Fair point
Not just a bit.
DId I say thousands?
I meant like, 5 people.
Because those people are honestly all that's left.
goddamnitwrekbot
Meanwhile: it's because you said ''fuck knows if prince dari is still awake'' and he said ''hm?'' like if he was behind you. and i laughed
But anyway, there's what, 100 people in here? 110?
And how many of these people remember BronyState from the 'good old days'?
I doubt it's a high number.
There's about 10 if you count the people who actually say anything.
LucidDreaming: It is still quite early, some people are still in school/work
well, yes the mane chat isn't exactly gold nowadays.....but i still love this place
MLP_Brovakiin: That means fuck all.
Eh, the 'good old days' change depending on when you joined.
What I'm trying to say is, the chat these days is more or less never good.
Things change, they always do
And people tend to be averse to change
dabi pls, you're obligated to say that because of position.
But this isn't being 'averse to change', Dairy Queen.
example, when i joined this place in late-febraury
So your 'good old days' may differ from people who join now, and will see these times as being the 'good old days'
This is an opinion that is shared by just about everyone else in the same position.
Everyone else in the same position being people who joined around the same time as you.
and by then i guess Hipster_Brony left
They don't like it as much since it has changed
You can't deny that quality of chat has dropped significantly over time.
Obviously other people find it enjoyable or they wouldn't be here.
i found out about him via newsletters, that's how i ''know him''
Princess-Daria, tell me, do you honestly enjoy mane chat now?
Be completely honest.
I remember when we used to discuss politics and high philosophy, I mean what?
Princess :D........please, come on
Well Excuuuuuuuuuuse me
Newfoals can't hope-in-dabiforce.
Again, that would be speaking from the perspective of someone who was here in the beginning, and has witnessed the place change.
It's not better or worse, just different.
and not just by stream change
I might have preferred things back in the 'golden days', but that's just me.
yeah i agree right here
So your answer is no.
there*
I do enjoy it still
That's all I needed, High Commander Darius of the 13th Legion.
Maybe not as I used to, but I still do.
I enjoy it for these brief moments.
When it's not entirely bogged down in molten spaghetti.
That's understandable, Darikins.
BBL
So Meanwhile!
What.
And anyone else who's been following this amusing little affair.
Who do you think I am?
Give me your best guess.
I wish I knew.
I don't know but I love you.
I'll humour you for a while.
I repeat, BaconMane.
You seem so familiar, yet nothing comes to mind.
Dave the plumber?
You're not Sprinks are you.
Come on Gaymoo, Kittywhile.
You can do better than that.
Ok now you have to be Elsie.
Hah, I wish I was Sprinks.
Or RX.
I really doubt it is Elsie.
He couldn't of become this intelligent overnight.
Actually, it's probably otakon who wishes he was Sprinks, then he could be the one inserting his rugged torpedo into she who must not be named's fluff taco.
...
But I digress.
Neil, it's notyou is it?
oh well i joined at a fun time
So I think it's time I stopped leading you all on.
Meanwhile: Good guess, you're getting closer.
But, I guess I should stop now.
That was fun.
00,10Oh we going all nostalgistic now?
Combustible Lemons?
Pfft.
Wow Neil.
Anyway.
Are you really that bored?
Nail you fucking glorious prick.
You fucking twat.
bad guess :D
lol
Of course, that's what I would say.
If you weren't lying.
Sumica: save us this chat has gone spoiled :|
00,10again?
i'm not lying :(
otherwise i would use this >_> <_< (AND THIS DOESN'T COUNT AS A LIE)
Ah but what if you're lying and it does count as a lie?
>.>
<.<
6_9
ohey thelonecubone
Ohai :3
This has been fun, Meanwhile, Jmo.
I used the Discorded AJ icon, but i just put them there, explaining in parenthesis that it's uneffective because i just put that disclaimer
Hrm.
Heya thelonecubone :)
Meanwhile: but otherwise, it would still be a lie :D
I'm surprised you didn't catch on earlier.
Hi MLP_Brovakiin :)
Except we still haven't.
I left a fair few clues: Notice how whilst I was talking in skype as well, I never talked at exactly the same time as LucidDreaming?
SuperBrony64: I got myself a pro controller, its pretty neat
Skype is too quiet, never made the connection.
Go fuck a cactus Neil.
Of course I commented on what he said, but there was always a slight disconnect.
The second clue was within my usage of in jokes and old memes that no one who didn't have access to the skype group would even know about.
Well, you pat yourself on the back for a job well done, I have to go lock the chicken coop.
Of course, that would have let you narrow it down to people inside the regs group, which was my intention.
this is like some warped scooby doo shit
^
Except BORING.
Buytoast: we need the Scooby Doors now
I was surprised you spent so long dwelling on whether it was Elsie or not, given that my style of typing is fairly different to his.
oh
Buytoast: I did get away with it, even with the intervention of those meddling kids.
Getting away with what? Being an ass? :|
MadSurge: wait, what happen?
Nothing happened.
move on.
^
ah, okay
Hey everypony
Oh hush MadSurge, play with some building blocks.
What happened in the past hour will not be discussed.
dont worry, i wont ask again
Jmo: I missed something retarded didn't I?
Hi Serenity :)
Heya Serenity :)
Meanwhile: someone is sore about not having a new troll friend? :P
MadSurge, shoo.
Don't get into it.
Serenity: You missed, as Buytoast so eloquently put it, 'some warped scooby doo shit'.
Implying I'm not friends with him anyway.
Meanwhile: <3
Frankly this has only made it a funnier experience.
ScootaChicken: <3
I will burn your house down Neil.
Jmo: no intention of doing that.
Jmo: Keep trying, Watson.
I will ;__;
So it's been what, two times in a row you've been fooled by someone in the regs chat posturing as an anon?
ScootaChicken: Aha
dat jaymoo here?
Hi aniderp_work :)
aniderp_work: yeah
Maybe
Hai aniderp_work :)

Uninteresting.
thelonecubone: Good thanks, you? :)

thelonecubone: Pfffft misping

GERZ
MLP_Brovakiin: doing good so far, doing a porject so far thats due on friday.
TEH WERLD END ES SERN!
and i havent put a dent on it :D
Brother_Aura: EHMEHGERD
Nah, it's not gonna end.
thelonecubone: a project about what?
let us watch the pretty slideshow involving fan art!
The chances of it ending is very low.
MadSurge: stuff <_<
>_>
All that is likely to happen is Yellowstone erupt, which will have a global effect, but not a terrible one
AssaultWithEmbraces: they claim it since the start of civilization
Ohai
Hai HavokOC :)
MadSurge: "claaim" And we've had how many false "end of the world" dates so far?
Fi: The chAnces of tHe WoRld enDing is SixTeyThree peRcent
Hi HavokOC :)
AssaultWithEmbraces: exactly
MadSurge: eggsactly
If the world was going to end, it would've ended 4 months ago.
13actually
remember the whole Y/2k?
dumb maims didn't assume leap years were a thing.
look at us right now
Ohai Shizuka :)
13the gregorian calendar ruins the mayan calendar
13if you take that into account
13the mayan calendar rolled over in like 2006
13so we've been dead for six years now
I stopped trusting calanderes after mine was a day off.
Shizuka: :D
Shizuka: That's nice. I'm dead. Thanks for brightening my day
So that's why.
So thats means i could do anything right niow? :D
now*
It makes so much sense.
We're all ghosts in an imaginary chat room talking about nonexistant ponies, yaaaaay!
How are you today Shizu?
Yay :23
:3*
13exhausted
13two hours sleep
that would kill me
Go to bread
I like bread
Shizuka: we might get snow soon! *mixture of happiness and road-related unhappiness*
MadSurge: 2010?
brb
Serenity: eh?
MadSurge: You were there, you know what I mean. Us buried in 6-8 ft of snow
Worst snow since the 70's
Serenity: wasn't that this year?
MadSurge: No, it happened in 2010, cuz I remember all the schools being shut
Especially around North Lincs and Scotland
Serenity: I dunno, the snow last february was so bad it was almost impossible to go around even on car
Ahh, we had sod-all last year
13meh snow
vee
13ours melted
Aorund mid december 2010, North Lincs was completely pwned by snow
13wish it would stay that way
Shizuka: yay for you! :)
Shizuka: So you can get floods?
13nope
13drainage is good around here
shoveling snow is nice
13snowblower :)
My gramps has a land rover, so we don't have problems with shit-tonnes of snow
but with a snowblower you don't get to launch the snow all over the place
Making a huge snowman is the obvious solution.
We hardly get snow in South Carolina because we're closer to the Equator, which sucks. I like playing in the snow
AHAHAHAHA http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/ec59310b6d1c661edd8ede8e75657b96.png Swim swim hungry!

That really rustled your jimmies didn't it MadSurge.

Morning everypony
Afternoon, AppleBloom
Meanwhile: I prefer baby talk over fake trolling
G'dat AppleBloom :3
tis a lie! it is morning :P
Ohai AppleBloom!
wow chat's quiet, and hello MadSurge and HavokOC
Eww, island keys
No stream often means little chat activity
I'd probably say it's more the time of day.
It's not prime time
Naah
Since even when a stream is on there's no guarantee chat'll be lively.
This time yesterday when sum-i streamed digimon/random anime there was peoplez
Tide yourselves over with this. http://i.imgur.com/8Svsa.gif
lol Meanwhile everyone loves that scene
Don't want to. I'm doing stuff.

Woah

Leomon!
HavokOC: mental resistance 100+ :D

alexxm: a fire monster got owned by a fire attack. Clearly this anime runs on no logic
00,10WIth luck our awsome techies may beable to come up with a work around for those that still dont have adblock
OMG! that digimon looks like those marshmellow things from doctor who
it attacks with bubbles?
MadSurge good point
Adventure gets so good later on! But is never as good as Tamers.
00,10Brb, gonna go grab some chow
"marshmellow things from doctor who"
Wat
HavokOC: one second I show
If it's a video, pm it :P
I've never seen Digimon in Japanese before, I wonder, is the monkey still like elvis?
anime never has logic thats why i love it so much!
so how long before they resort to canabalisim
...
* puts hand up *
Digimon has no logic because it is set in the intetnet... no joke that's where they are :)
Socks so where are the ponies and 4chan
HavokOC: I present marshmellow aliens http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinogee/5095320002/
Ooooh, those
The flesh people
Well

And dayum, screen got yellow >.<
ah right i forgot Socks
meanwhile in digimon world...
moonslicer in pokemon world.
yea
And then they died. The end
Jmo in Milky Milk world.
Mayjoo you'll never be in Milky Milk world.
It's pretty much after this episode that things get pretty epic. <---Huge Digimon nerd
MadSurge: good ending

Good afternoon, everyone. How are you all today? :)
THIS AIN'T NO POKEMANS
Omg Sumi thank you! Thank you so much!
Jmo, that's what I meant.

00,10true, altho a distant friend is a bit more beleavable then an never before mentioned brother
yup
but they both just fucking SUCK
00,10meh I like Cadace
Cadance is best missile
I can't even bake pre-made cookies without burning the bottom lol
AttackWithHugs: I know that feeling. :D
:D
00,10you have the pan to low in the oven if you are burning the botom before they top is done
I don't mind Cadance and Shining Armor, as long as they expand on their character.
right, cause they need to focus on 2 recently introduced characters more than previously established ones
00,10soch a strange combnation
00,10Space time magic police
/me sucks at baking cookies. But her porkchops and chicken comes out delicious
but Bronysith
the mary sue horse force is the main focus of the series
00,10funny thing is AttackWithHugs, cooking is an art, bakeing is a science
Magic School Bus taught me that, Sumica :3
Bronysith: I did not say that they need to focus on them more than others. I said that I wouldn't MIND it if they focused on their character if they got the chance.
Shizuka, that your dvd of the horses?
00,10spin off shows for all ponies
Sumica, I enjoy cooking though I don't do it more of it. I've made a burrito wrap-thing that can count as breakfast and lunch

AttackWithHugs: put some trouts on that sammich

that counts as cannibelism for joomay
:>
What's that wolf creature doing there? :D
AJIsHaunter: oh, yes......i think the same about them too
trouts and spiders? that sounds unsafe
hola thelonecubone!!!!
AttackWithHugs: That's the point. ;)

Anyway, back to my complaint
/me JOKE ABORTED
Anyone who's taken apart tonnes of PC's know how to get a PSU with a slightly damaged screw out?
Serenity drill
unless you want to keep the PSU
00,10have to drill it out unless you got one of those cutscrews
Ahh bugger
I kinda *need* the PSU
/me gives a glass of warm lemonade
00,10then drill carefully
.-.
What's a careful?
00,10somthing you do when you want to keep the PSU
Ahh, I see
Makes sense
you could also try grips
and turn it the hard way
well wat else do you want jmo? i dun know wat u drink in yer sparre times
'warm lemonade'
Give me some hot kool-aid while you're at it why not.
00,10but yeah cut screws are a nice tool
00,10used for removeing broken and damaged screws
00,10if you have a dremmle you could try and cut the screw head off
worth the extra cost
not sure if sarcasm....
<_<
/me hates not being able to detect sarcasm or a joke
only the cut screw lets you actually use that screw point again though
00,10indeed Chrysalis
AttackWithHugs, I'm used to not being able to detect sarcasm... kinda
Kandarihu: I take things way too literally, even with my friends and family. Having a logical mind sucks at times.
AttackWithHugs, true dat
AttackWithHugs: you sound like my brother :D
He can NEVER detect jokes :D
MadSurge: Together, your brother, Kandarihu and I shall form the Anti-Joke Coalition Club Thing
:D
AttackWithHugs: :D
I'll burn your club to ashes.

Cause I can.

AttackWithHugs: sorry for fishing again, but did you like my present? :3
Toodles
Aww
I'll kill everyone.

Jmo: You can try, but you won't succeed. :3
AJIsHaunter! :$
MadSurge! :$
Don't test me boy.

I'm so excited that I can't express it.
You just don't know how much I missed you.

I bet you do.
Jmo? Sarcasm? No......
AJIsHaunter: you could tell you sillieh fillieh :3

You'll learn. A plot develops!
This thing has a plot?!
MadSurge, most of these characters will become important later on.
ah good one, MadSurge ;)
^
MadSurge: Just alot of forced jokes
H.E.L.P.E.R. is adorable.
ikr
These guys all look like Spiderman villain rejects
http://i.imgur.com/tf6Dk.jpg is that really your best way to describe a game?
MadSurge: :D
MadSurge: they probably are
even then "skyrim with guns" is just fallout

god machinima you are so stupid

Bronysith: ... you and your hatin on skyrim
http://i.imgur.com/VSe3S.jpg oh....oh shit
Eli: im not hating on skyrim, at all
yay 21 & 24
just saying, there are better ways to describe your game
Who the hell are those butterfly guys?
Such a happy family.
Bronysith: well... then you're preaching how fallout is better... it's still just an opinon
00,10the wrath of the monarch
i didnt say fallout was better
i really love her face
all i said was "skyrim with guns, is just fallout"
voice*
Eli: quit saying i said something that i didnt say,
Bronysith: you said that before...
yea, but not today
Orpheus you crazy motherfucker.
dr strange?
Tatyana!
alexxm: Dr O
Well The Elder Scrolls and Fallout are both from the same company.
http://i.imgur.com/4cGYr.jpg okay, this is cool
Kandarihu: yup, so another company trying to ride on anothers success is utter laziness
Bronysith: Skyrimous? :D
;D
XD Oh 24.
:D
he became a tuff at the end of series :3
pony_3045: No spoilers please.
ok
SPHINX
wait, wut?
damn you spoilers >:I
sorry
but it really far far away
00,10if you were sorry you would not do it

i just love 21
sorry i think everyone know about him
i didn't
=___=
GOoooooooooooooooooooood soop

No way out from up there
Sumica: <3
Ah, Megas.
MEGAAAAAS
Oh, fuck yes! ^_^
is this the space pirate episode
Who are 21 and 24?
Who digs giant robots?
YEAS
http://i.imgur.com/sYKs3.jpg
YES!!!!
I used to watch this show all the time
everyone
i believe 21 was the fat guy
Sith, can you stop linking irrelevant images?
and 24 is the skinn guy, that are both friends
Hehe
Bronysith: clearly nintendo fans are insane
they are*
The lorry reversing sound always tickles me
thelonecubone, yes.
MadSurge, that fatty guy with wings is 21 and his friend 24
MadSurge: no shit
the problem with that mario image is that the bottom two strayed away from better examples while the top two merely ride mediocrity
HALO
00,10Halo before halo
super mario sunshine was awesome
Oh
So its Reach
oh i liked sunshine
i'm mainly talking about sticker star
living here in jersey, fighting villans for afar~
from*
/me is still waiting for Mario Sunshine 3D
00,10more like Marathon ACS13123
I. DIG. GIANT ROBOTS.
wait, wut? :O
Nice ;)
LadyCanary: who doesnt?
who doesn't dig giant robots?
Ill just go with that
Cause I have no idea what you are talking about
:S
Bronysith: People who don't like giant robots, of course.
Clearly Bungie ripped off this cartoon
00,10Marathon came before Halo
I think I might have seen this one before...
anyone else oozing with nostalgia?
Hey
...
zombies?
woah
If Bandai Namco ever wants to get a non-OG Super Robot Wars game published in the U.S., they need to get in touch with Cartoon Network and get the rights to use every single mecha franchise that has ever been on the channel... maybe even Titan Maximum.
WOAH http://i.imgur.com/l4S17.jpg
No powah
Break everything Coop!
Break ALL the things!
whats up?
I would probably be, IF MY VIDEO WAS WORKING
Problem is, they'd need other publishers or else it'll just be nothing but Supers
Bronysith: SuperBrony64's keyboard :D
^
MadSurge: i want one
00,10then handels seem silly
try to search 'The Venture Bros.: What Is Left Of My Bathroom' thats why i just love 21 and 24 :D
i needs it
OH LOOK; CYBERTRON
whops
excuse that
pony_3045, that's from later on, though.
POWAH ON
RUN
Just finished presenting some code to my class... the professor turned it into a debugging session and kept us 10 minutes late
And then the universe died
Dem MLG skills~
7The scoundrel?
"The mysteries of the universe are revealed when you break stuff."
but this series not really going straight with episodes so there is no spoilers
just awesomness
Gah, constantly behind on the stream
of them
Any gaems on zem?
Coop, stop thinking about games all the time. :D
You waek up and you have a computer with no games
Wat do?
someone halo'd hard
ACS13123: Either download some, buy a console and get some, or just continue on life.
Dat dodge
they so cool :D
i play tetris.
lucky kid
ACS13123, Nethack is an excellent game that will run on systems that won't run anything else.
wut's this?
lol
Megas XLR
00,10heh even with it on the screen peopel still ask whats this.
Sumica: Not everyone can read
his face when
00,10then why ask what they cant read?
Sumica: I like this thing showing what it is being streamed
Serenity, and the difference between reading the text on the screen and the text in the IRC is...
Sumica: I'm guessing people are too focused on the video to pay attention to the title above.
Kandarihu: People are ignorant
this is one of the best giant mech shows ever
also Triana reminds me Rose Lalonde c:
00,10who knew meagas was bigger on the inside
Who?
Serenity, ... the text in IRC respond to their asking, but not the text on the stream. I guess they're just seeing the text on top of the screen and not noticing that it's the title of the show.
who'S triana?
Orpheus daughter
Dark_Horst, Dr Orpheus' daughter
00,10damit coop
COOP
YOU IDIOT

You dun goofed.

BATTER UP
Sumica: TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANK
AJIsHaunter: i remember you asking this yesterday, did this show have a finale?
Wow
Bronysith: If you want to, I'd suggest you inform people tat you want to.
There is litterally no buffer now
twixie_sprinkle: I'm not sure.

THERES THE TANK

twixie_sprinkle: it ended on a cliffhanger :(
-____-
Thanks to Dari I've been introduced to Doctor Who, and thanks to Sumica I've been introducted to Venture Bros.... Wonder what epicness will happen next.
PAWNCH!
MadSurge: so it was cancelled and not ended?
gg
oh that sucks :D
gg no re
Yup :(
MadSurge: That sucks. :<
AJIsHaunter: indeed
MadSurge: how do shows like this get cancelled, i just dont get it..
Just like the Splatterhouse reboot :(
I wonder why some of the best shows out there are cancelled without a proper ending given.
you are worthless
Because either budget issues or stupidity.
^
Because we need more shows like Kiddie Teen Ghost Hunters and crap...
LadyCanary speaks the truth
00,10damit coop
Stallion_of_War: Kiddie Teen Ghost Hunters?
oh shit
What, Stallion_of_War? And MadSurge, I could do without the sucking up.
no budget for shows liek this Is stupidity
It was on Cartoon Network for awhile.
Was it live action?
LadyCanary: eh? I don't suck up to anyone
I think so
This is pretty cool
live action shows on a cartoon network?
bah
sounds like modern disney and nickelodeon
TACTICAL NUKE INBOUND
This and Samurai Jack... Resquiet In Pace good cartoons..
ITS OVER
speaking of disney, i still need to watch gravity falls

My true greatest fear of all is related to Coop's fear
the only thing you have to fear are dolls
or being locked in a pitch black room with dolls lining the walls.

Buytoast: or being with a communist
THAT MONSTER!

Hello everypony!

hi VenHur
Hi, VenHur. :)
Hi VenHur :)
alexxm|foal, I don't remember the missiles flying in a wild course.
I LOVE this show! As a tyke, I thought it was boring and unappealing to me.
DENIED
Heya VenHur :)
...BOY, WAS I WAS DUMB?!
how are things VenHur
lolol
keep at it coop
Punch 'em!
00,10sadly VenHur many thought that way about it
You show 'em, Coop!
00,10it was marketed wrong
I loved this show as a child. I love it even more as an adult. :D
^
^^
GilDash: (\
00,10it should have been put in an a more adult time slot
&^^^
Stallion_of_War: /)
This show was mainly aired around dinnertme in the UK
dem tentacles
so whats the deal with his car being a giant robot?
Oh shi
Sumica: After I seen Aurtach of Flame's video about this, my opinions about this changed, thus, I'm a fan now.
He's ded
No
They ded
the end has come
Wait
Japan's worst nightmare. A planet-sized tentacle monster.
Why not just do the robot jesus thing you did last episode
DIE MTV DIE
Stallion_of_War thats their nightmare
Keep lookin bro
00,10next to the ham button
Ham
gotta have a ham button
jcelios, the robot was sent back in time from the future, but it's head was lost. Coop found it in a garbage dump and bought it for $2 and fixed it up in his own style... including a car to replace the head
m:D
:D*
The buttons were always the best of this show
fire everything@
*!
haha thanks
Kandarihu: He never payed the 2 dollars
Yeah. I wonder what that "Sorry Bro" button does.
Actually, MTV is a gag in this show, it always appeared as a marketing in any forms before something or someone blows it up.
$2 for anything in that pile.
Pew pew
That and the "Conviently empty building" labels. :D
I guess the producers must of hates MTV...
A LOT.
I dont know what javascript autocomplete in rails is.
AJIsHaunter: "Museum full of priceless and unreplacable artifacts"
I think there was some dispute between them and MTV
00,10Because this show was supposed to be on MTV
Serenity: I never saw that one. :D
00,10then after they had the deal MTV backed out
It was on Toonami in the UK
Sumica: Holy shit, really? [NBC: The More You Know]
But then MTV would have good shows on it :o
00,10causeing alot of issues and stalling the show for many years till CN took it over
The universe would have exploded!
Sumica: so its a Take That running gag?
Oh, this scene.
00,10yep
Take That?
More like OBJECTION!
Pretty much this http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ with a rails model behind it
Fak
Agreed, Coop.
Sumica: Speaking of MTV, they revived Beavis and Butt-Head.
00,10meh
Sumica: No, I mean, really. I had proof.
ALL the spikes!
00,10and i meen meh, never cared for the show much
Oh.
Lol
Suddenly stable orbit
Ohhright...
00,10rant
I wasn't into Beavis and Butthead as many other people were. It never really appealed to me.
RANT
/me dat Star Trek parody music
me neither
I don't even completely understand it so it's kind of hard to explain =/
Can I ask you guys a question?
Just find the "Destroy Planet" button]
Well, LittleKuriboh liked that show...
Sure, glitchdetector.
But i'm just saying.
I see there is a lot of people watching the stream at almost all times.
i dont care for littlekuriboh either
VenHur: He's welcome to like the show if he wants to.
What is the reason for that?
little kuriboh <3
ENEMY EMP
they are just idling in IRC I think
the father of the abridged series
ELECTRONICS ARE DOWN
That might be true
Well
glitchdetector: Because the streams are entertaining?
Makes sense
hai people
EMP Fridge
:D
But hey
We were expecting a bigger torpedo, buuut, that'll do.
[shrug]
how does he manage to reverse-engineer future tech so well but not know what an emp is
I havent opened my Pony Advent Calendar today
Here we go
wonder what I get
twixie_sprinkle: mechanics
Did he said...CUPCAKES?!
legit physics
...
twixie_sprinkle, well clearly he's not going on technology levels.
VenHur: Yep. He stored them in the fridge.
Bronysith: he would have encountered electro-magnetics very foten if he were to reverse-engineer such a robot
...Yup, he's a Brony before Bronies were Bronies.
twixie_sprinkle: just shut up and enjoy the show
NEEDS MORE GUN
daaaaaam
OH NO HE SAID CUPCAKES everypony panic blah blah blah
Bronysith: you could just say "i dont know".
twixie_sprinkle: Just do it.
Bronysith: You can criticize a show and still like it.
DAYUM
VenHur: he was a brony......before it was cool
THATS DESTRUCTIVE
Well that was lucky
MAI GUD, DAT'S TEH BIGGEST GUN I EVER SEEN!
HOLY SHIT!
VenHur: No it isn't. *Pulls out bigger gun*
Because he's a good guy.
THIS SHOW IS AWESOME!
how is everyone?
fine
Serenity: [mother of god face]
Welp
HAHAHA.

Coop..... XD
--"
Coop is the most responsible son.
I just found a owlolishious i cant spell that in my Advent Calendar
A conventional EMP generator is an electrical generator crushed by explosives while running at full-tilt. Perhaps if that's what the EMP torpedo was, he'd be the kind of guy to enjoy cannibalizing something like that.
how do you spell that name
00,10dont do it coop
