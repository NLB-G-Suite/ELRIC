thats the only qualifier anyone has attached to it
I have nothing whose line related
I know i have My fair share of problems
the anxiety might not be a condition and rathter an aritfact of aspergers, i'm mostly over it now
yes
00,02yeah
11,01I've been accused of having it, and I'm wondering if I do. I'm intelligent and an excellent problem solver, but I have social problems.
Welcome to the ranks of most intelligent people on this Earth.
00,02THANK YOU
00,02IT FINALLY WORKED
Nice
11,01I mean, I took high-level math for fun in college.
00,02Barbetos, i was trying that, but my old account is bugged

Old account? Did you play Global Agenda?

this is one time I kidna want a 360, but I'd have to pay alot just to stay online, which is total bullsh*t.
We're gonna watch ponies on XBOX
:I
11,01I hate assholes and fear them a bit IRL.
*the
Castle Crashers!
:D
11,01Since even a little criticism can hurt me.
Psychopaths just have a demonstrable lack of empathy and sense of social responsibility. In a sense they're just disjointed.
but yeah, empathy is one of the things that people aspergers lack, you have to learn it
brb, I'll get my xbox set up now.
at all
Wut
11,02Guess I don't exist :<
hello voice
Oh I get it he's playing Wolfenstein 3D! :3
who's voice is that?
11,01If someone comes in depressed IRL, I wouldn't know how to act.
the theory that makes most sense to me is that aspergers is a lack of 'mirror neurons'
wolfenstein!!
11,02:D
hello
maybe the xbox is crazy
fuck it mines Owning The Hand
lol
Woah
KILL ME
the best way i can descirbe it emotinally is detatched
Basically, Aspergers is social awkwardness in genetic form.
11,01I care about things. I care too much in fact.
Also, Nitt, Aspergers has been around since 1944.

And half of them, at least, aren't really all that great conversation.
It's really a problem of numbers.
Damn those Trojans

I stopped watching pony ytps becuase it ruined the episodes and the characters as well for me.
11,01And average age.
can i keep you?..

Hey
We should do Maid Hour in here.

11,01Maybe.
I assume we're all mature enough.
This episode is really light on the drinking according to my list.
11,01Yeah.
those cute eyes
11,01And if people start changing to their maid nicks, it'll trigger a maid hour in main.
as long as the average maturity is high enough, chats can regulate themselves

To be honest, this is my opinion on shipping. If you do though, you're welcome to.
Ponykart's still up.
moral: shipping is bad and you should feel bad!
It's open source, they've got a background character designer open.

leading farm animals around isn't taming
then there is slime, my greatest pray...
i told him about taming and about something else.

That's like selling a fanfiction, isn't it?
You can sell fanfiction if you want to.
No you can't
Not without getting sued
This is a land of opportunity...Merica.
Yeah, but there's a thing called copyright law?
That's why you buy the license like I said.
You can't sell something that's made with somebody else's property.
Read my posts plz
Like it's that easy to buy a license
it is
I'll be right back.
ok

Goddamn it son of a bitch!
08,01so not many people know this
08,01but i have... i dunno, a fear, an extreme distaste, of bins
Like waste bins?
08,01yes
O_o
08,01the thought of touching one fills me with abject terror
o.o
...germaphobe?
08,01so she opened the bin, and dug through it to find the packet
08,01i nearly screamed
08,01i freaked the fuck out
08,01i demanded she wash her hands 3 times
Oh, you mean touching the CONTENTS of the bin
08,01Gold_Demona: contents or actual bin
08,01anything to do with bins
Oh... hm
Recycle bins on the computer scare him too.
08,01she was refusing to wash them the third time, and i nearly broke down in tears; that's how upsetting it was to me
08,01my brain is weird sometimes
...that's kind of sad. I guess.
00,02ohai Saturn
08,01Gold_Demona: well, yeah, but it's not just like "eew, gross", it actually freaks me the fuck out
08,01i told this to my best friend in edinburgh; when i made bad puns or horrific jokes, she'd chase me around her flat with a broom she'd dipped in the bin
I can't say that's the weirdest phobia I've ever heard, but it's right up there.
oops wrong tab again :D
That is cruel of her Saturn * There we go.
08,01AdamTheDuck: well, she knew not to actually touch me with it, or corner me; it was all in good fun
I have an irrational fear of personally interacting with people I don't know.
08,01i'm sort of like that about plants too
08,01but not to the same level
plants aren't much of a threat to humans. Some can be poisenous
It's really stupid, cuz I have a hard time even making phone calls to get important things done.
08,01MASF123: i just find them tres creepy
I have a phobie of some kinds of raugh surfaces, like Cartboard Boxes
They ok
I can't touch them without my hair thanding streight up
Saturn do you suffer from any past truamas?
08,01i don't have many fears, but the ones i do have are rather strane
is it still +phase4 streaming this?
08,01*strange
Hi all
could be something you can't remember
a type of really cheap wall...
Oh, like drywall?
08,01Lil_B: plasterboard?
elevators and escalators...how are they for you, Saturn?
08,01sammiver: <3
Saturn exactly
@saturn <3 <3 <3
oh...
Saturn how about a Patanostra?
08,01Lil_B: i'm absolutely fine in those
bins...why do you fear them?
We're discussing fears? I was terrified of lizards when I was little :D
Was afk :3
it's normal.
08,01MASF123: *you're
Fears? Well, that would be jellyfish
hello
They are not animals, they grow line plants but they are not plants either and then they float around like animals but they are not animals..... wtf
08,01sammiver: the weather in scotland is great too
well, I have fears of Hights too XD If I'm more than 23 steps on a ledder or bending over a railing without having my hands on something to hold me I'm close to becoming uncouncous
2 Steps*
And some are even immortal (capable of selfregenerate cells and reprocude themselves withexact copies)
Screw jellyfish
I'm now scared of twilight.
phobia
@saturn that is good :$ is the weather there usually good ?
Jellyfish used to be normal fish, but when the other fishes saw them they laughed at them and said "You Jelly?" because they couldn't swim
08,01LadyFluxum: actually, they *are* animals
08,01(according to wikipedia :P)
Oh
Still freak me out
wohai Saturn
wikipedia
/me gives out hugs
They're just one of the animals that fall under "really freaking weird".
But their cullular makeup is more of a hybrid of plant and animal
08,01LadyFluxum: it blew my mind when i foudn out that virii are not actually alive
some Jellyfish even have developed some early stages of Eyes
Saturn any other fears?
I think it looks fun
Hi :)
08,01i had American Mountain Dew for the first time last week
00,02we won
Saturn different from the MtnDew here?
Saturn: lol, IKR?
Yep mountain dew tastes sooo good

But suit yourself
ALL DEM GAMES SHOUT OUTS :D
i like fluttershy
I hate to say this. Rainbow Dash is my least favorite.
:(
200 hours to validate magica
hmmm uh i dont like pinkie
Argh! I gotta restart..*grumbles*
Well, if we're only talking about the mane six, Twilight's my least favorite.
I like each of the mane six, all for different reasons
Fluttershy, Twilight, and Pinkie Pie match my personality. Rarity is unique, but more complex (which makes her interesting). Applejack intimidates me, but she can handle herself. I just don't like competition, which is why Rainbow Dash is there.
my little sis is BUGGING ME
Saturn awesome
awesome Saturn
"Det va nu danskt"?
I <3 LUNA
Saturn: very cute
She used to be sixth favorite, but she bounced her way up as the series progressed. =P
Pinkie went from bottom to near top to me aswell
No. Fluttershy is my favorite. Twilight is best. Pinkie Pie is just fun lovin'
is anyone here a clopper?
<.<
yeah
what're we watching
"Magicka"
/me bites Jmo's ear
Hiiii
I think my top three is Fluttershy Rarity and Pinkie
are they speaking a twist of civilation language and simese?
Actually, I'm incredibly shy when meeting up with people.
*cilization
it looks like noone here is a clopper.........good
hah
http://www.redbubble.com/people/scrittah/works/7620933-stealthy-pink-e-pi-shirt
Well atleast Pinkie is on that list.
this ones quite clever
Well time for me to hit the hay, night everyone. :)

I guess the tentacle outfit is a fun reference
bah whatever
haha
Wow
I know
I heard
DED
<.< why are guns in magicka
They're magic guns! :D
It's also one of the buggiest games I've ever played
LOL
Saturn should i get http://ih0.redbubble.net/image.11689703.1906/fig,black,mens,ffffff.jpg or http://ih2.redbubble.net/image.11677277.3756/fig,navy,mens,ffffff.jpg

in the middle of the night
YES!
eww psn
Personally I thought 8 was boring.
the story rivals or beats just about anything ever made
Not NEARLY as boring as 12, but pretty boring.
I thouht you had 8?
Is it one of the 800 hour long ones?
and only on the 2nd of 4 disks
Is it one of the games that's 60% cutscene?
if 8 was the one I played, it didn't have that many cutscenes
Ok
but the cutscenes are georgious
is the stream on?
no
http://youtu.be/-6b6HYHcF0A
As far as FF's, I liked 6, 7, 9, and 10 the most.
In that order
though 6 and 7 are interchangeable
which one was the 8? The one wiht the train?
back :)
the stream doesnt work for me....
its down
Welkommen
:)
hmm
That might have been the one I was told to play-
Doesn't make up for boring story and characters though.
gunblade is ridicilous
hehe
*spelling
most ff weapons are ridiculous, but- you don't see them very often?
thats it
I like the ridiculous weapons in FF mostly because they're unique
Like Sephiroth's katana. Seriously. That thing's ridiculously long.
WOW
fuck it
yeah it was like odd 3D
the live stream doesnt work for me....
it was not in the beginning--I think...
the beginnign was like in a --place and you went dancing
/me master of memory
Anyone playing on Desolation on Gw2 :P?
Okay, then I've played 8 and tiny tiny tiny bit of 6 when I was a kid
As far as story, I think 6 and 7 had better-developed stories.
00,02?
but, retrying is fun
I remember ff8's battle system being annoying.
Mostly because I sucked at doing those "timed trigger attack" things
ok
Ew

/me cries abuse, shouts for help
WTF kind of program cant install an upgrade made for it?
08,01soem AMAZING photos there
00,02Saturn, i gots ipv6 working :3
I lost faith in their ability to tell a good story
They're graphics are gorgeous but that doesn't excuse crappy storytelling
AKA FALSE GAMERS
00,02Saturn, next year i'ma try get to the uk and attend
:) I've pretty much destroyed the outer casing to Rage Quitting - throwing the thing across the room just about everytime 7's installation was cancelled and restarted
00,02o_O
the discs are fine though :)
08,01Phase4: <3
08,01Bronysith: <3 too
worst part -I cant take it back - too damaged :D
Hehe
I wouldn't call them false gamers. They're just easily impressed
:3
I havent attempted to reinstall it for 7 months now - I know the end result all too well
Saturn dont i get <3?
:(
I don't believe false gamers exist, but- I know theres a flux of casual and mainstream gamers
CASUALS!!!!!!
and I don't mind
more money for the companies is good for me
00,02Lets settle this argument: Graphics are not everything, nor are they meeningless
08,01Bronysith: i mostly play games for the graphic
08,01s
Saturn: you said you liked TES arena
Beat those Vivixs!
i recognize Saturn as a gamer
08,01heh
00,02Saturn, also i get a /56 prefix for some reason
08,01that's ironic, because i don't like computer games, really
08,01whoops
08,01i just find them kinda boring, mostly
<3
08,01Phase4: on IPv6?
Atm, my obsession is next gen physics
00,02sammiver, yes
00,02Saturn, yes
Herbal Essence ad
08,01Vivix: generational physics?
Saturn: well at least you dont say you are a gamer like most assholes nowadays
08,01Vivix: like particle physics?
08,01Bronysith: i'm the antithesis of a gamer
08,01oh
... these Remix War Requirements are bullshit... why do I have to use Box.com or Minus.com as upload sites and not Mediafire?
08,01i've coded physics simulations before
00,02ma prefix is 2001:44b8:4196:e800::
Fluid Dymanics intregs me and pisses me off at the same time
hehe
00,02there are many like it, but this one is mine
X3
yeah, I think all the traffic planners go by fluid simulation now
Saturn: EXACTLY
08,01my favourite branch of physics is particle physics
particle pysics is ok
erm... is someone here good with photoshop or another Programm to edit a picture?
08,01which kinda ties in with particle physics in the sense of accelerator design
electromagnetisim is awesome
when I was 13 I built a guass gun
and I did all the math
well most of the math
and maybe I was 14
but still
IDKY but i is fun
Hehehe, oh yes there it is
00,02every now and again
08,01Dumori: that's awesome
Saturn I've nto touched electronics since I was 16
more or less
08,01Saturn boast time: i got a scholarship to St Andrews
Sation fuck you I got a U in A2
math
Saturn*
+phase4 yes
00,02Saturn is best Station
08,01Dumori: i got a scholarship for the Comp Sci degree at St Andrews without having any qualifications in the subject
I dropped out and went to a no-degree music school
/me unemployed
Tbh I just tossed off at college
like the exam
!
LOl
08,01i'm going to be studying acoustics and music technology for my Masters degree
08,01it's gonna be AMAZING
00,02sammiver, depends on how good a swimmer you are :P

00,02gota swim all the way to aus
Saturn: very nice
Saturn I R JELLY

08,01ho-ly-shit

weell, she's halfblooded or something
She ages at rate of Twilight, and marries a mortal. I don't think shes full blooded
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW578GeFTw4
I would do a more active contrast for her mane, make her less yellow
alicorn+mary sue
haha its just a description I got from a quiz
I feel sweaty and exhausted
my OC's are a Cervine mix and a Goatalope hybrid- I need a pony
fucking alicorn ocs
not very creative
at all
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmaUjvUetmQ&feature=player_detailpage
baaam
Cant we agree that pretty much all OC's suck?
alicorns
Wow, harsh guys
^
Ijust like the fact I have wings
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkcU54BO6Q4
00,10\
Alicorns are fine, as long as they aren't Mary Sues.
the pinkie pie hair is still up in the air...
00,10almost done with a mann up
I got otns of OC's, none based on me
00,105 bonus tickets
:o
00,10HI ^_^

Instead of being dicks and insulting people, why not just give them advice?
/me glomps Saturn
Saturn: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkcU54BO6Q4

haha blame the ok cupid quiz for that
0,5CCCP
:o
WHOO!
0,5See See See Pee
this is too amazing
Some people are just hating
0,5Oi Saturn
0,5>>
00,10whats the worst is people with Alicorn OC's =p
08,01Sumica: what's wrong with alicorn OCs?
oc
0,5inb4 13
I just thin it's odd that people think OC means "The pony that represents me"
Saturn, Mary-sues
I agree
0,5I think alicorns are fine as long as:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZmwlQy5bJk
0,5They dont have some dumb backstory
more than 10
0,5They aren't related/involved with canon characters
00,10no but he had one on his crew Saturn
0,5They arent made in pony-creator
08,01LoGaN: i'm younger than you
00,10her name was infact mary sue
0,5Then they're fine to me
Woah!! I thot it was +m for a sec there :D
Saturn: thats impossible
00,10yep
0,5Yeah its wierd
08,01MASF123|: i'm 12
O_o
0,5Even ANIMATIONS are being made with pony creator
Lol. me too :3
jk
0,5Its sickening -_-
00,10oh then I have to kick you now Saturn
08,01>.>
0,5Yeah
hi guys :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAjDAU2RhmE
0,5He's a nice person and all but I don't like the way he animates
08,01i'm actually 25
I'm 21.
I'm 28. Does that make me the oldest?
I'm 18.
put a vector and wobble it
0,5Wha? Nooooo
13
(will not saay age)
I hatez him
I think his style is good, but I don't like his movies
08,01life is fucking awesome
18 is an awesome age
O_O
*say
I think they're a bit dull, but his style is very fluid and neat, but too cartoony to be cool for anything but a joke
yaeh
Of course, but I don't think it's funny- it's not my taste, but his style is very suited to it
the man is a sicko.
nah id hate to live a day over 18
WWWWWWWWWHHHHAAAATTTTTTT Saturn !!!!!!!
DId he ever make SWAG.MOV yet?
no bones, too fluid, rubberband reality changes to designs, etc
08,01LoGaN: i'm not even making that up
wait is there a flim on?
18 is an awesome age
if i had a dollar for every alicorn oc there is...i would be soooo fucking rich
wish I can be 18 again
08,01but that's just for the summer
I liked the .MOV series until it got to the most recent one, PARTY.MOV. That was disgusting........:S
08,01LoGaN: http://www.bronyuk.org/about-us/staff.html
But hey, if you like the .MOV series? No problem.
I have seen under 5 alicorn OC's in my time at FIMFiction, unless I hunt for them I won't find more
Saturn: /)
It's not my intention- I like his style. Sorry
OC's are ok.
08,01AJIsAwesome: (\
Shipping makes ne Lol.
Saturn: aww the fahking uk? mother******
me
agg, I think I would be the oldest here, but I could be wrong
and I do believe Hotdiddgey can do more than that cartoony style
08,01LoGaN: for the purposes of this conversation, yes
08,01also, goddamnit guys, it's "you're"
Pretty much yeah
Lol! :D
08,01as in, the contraction of "you are"
yeah its you're retards!
Saturn: no. they ask if you own a girl :P
I am just 20 years younger from them
08,01Eli: yes to that as well
>__>
any other pegasisters here?????
08,01i keep her in my basement, and only let her out for cooking and sex.
08,01Jmo: thank you. i try
Saturn: ... no comment to that (but it's kinda hot)
Fuck! :( i have to go
aww
08,01CCCP: yes you, back to the basement!
Saturn: >.>
:D
Bye ccce
Dat ccce o.o
damn... gotta go afk. cul8r
no he wasn't
How does one 'belive'
08,01MadSurge: i really am!
Lol! :D
Unless you just wandered on stage from the street. Which you may have done
Hey guys. Just got home from church
08,01i'm making tea!
08,01darjeeling, to be precise!
0,5Quite
Saturn: you never say hi to me when i join and ive been here since april
08,01LoGaN: I'M SORRY FOR MY SINS :(
0,5Come now let's not be that way
08,01LoGaN: absolve me?
WHATS HAPPENING?!?!
0,5EVERYTHING
LOUD NOISES~
0,5LBGEIGBEDG
0,5>>
0,5<<
08,01but that's also a joke
0,5cornucopia?
08,01because... well, what's the other term for cornucopia?
:D O U
08,01yes, that's right, "horn of plenty" :P
0,5horn of plenty
0,5ooooooh
0,5So it means you're horny often
i want oc
lol I was gonna say "There's another term for cornucopia?"
i want OC how i get one?
Thanks
0,5LoGaN assuming youre not kidding around you just make one
0,5Draw or think of, you dont gotta draw it
0,5Choose good colors that look handsome though
0,5Dont give accessories
0,5Broken horns / chipped ears / accessories = NO
Applejack has like 5 million cousins, not too far fetched
:o
0,5Also no connections to canon characters
/me gargle gargle (blood fills mouth from Bronysith)
0,5Its generally frowned upon
I don't know why it's frowned apon, since OC's haven't been important until they've been used in an actual story
Well damn, my OC has accessories O_o
of course not, fanon either unless they're used in a story
Well, hes clothed, lol
alicorn image with handbag on his head, is more an avatar than an oc since he has no story or use
Yes, but I don't quite get why people care unless they're used in something they read or use
0,5Yes
0,5Using pony creator is fine
0,5But dont make an attrocity of an OC ><
I always have glasses when I draw my OC. Maybe because I wear glasses IRL
I've made a few, none of them ponies, and of course, none of them based on me or related to me in any way. But I haven't used them in anything
Well, they're hardly OC*s, just designs
0,5Youre right
http://i.imgur.com/PPryN.gif
0,5THey're just Cs
08,01but in pony form
but mine have no stories or character. They're just designs
Saturn: :D
:o
08,01BUT HE CHOSES NOT TO
o_o
0,5Lemme guess: He's married to Celestia and gave birth to the mane 6
I kind of like my pony, but the yellow seems too yellow
0,5o__e
Saturn is going to get nerfed next patch.
08,01BaconMane: no, of course not; he's celestia's cousin
0,5GAAAAHGVKEG VLKJVG LEKBGUGE
Lol
hehehe

0,5This is my OC

0,5Stupid tumblr people, accusing me of being a friggin' carnivore
/me 0,5licks blood off his lips

0,5I guess Ill link me thingie

http://mivix.deviantart.com/gallery/?catpath=scraps#/d5ar5ci This would be the closest thing to OC I have, a goatalope. But my avatar is usually just a nameless deer

0,5hehe
Are we watching the buffer show again?
I regret nothing
working on color for my pony was something that I just have to tackle
0,5Colors on an OC
0,5Are the hard part
0,5Nope
0,5You must wait
0,5You need to find the right color combo
dat Ash
0,5My other OCs took me a while to figure out their colors
Oh wow.
after I make my pony, I might make a page on FB
I'm abused!
I like to color...
and to draw
OH MIRC color.. ahh
0,5On a light blue coat....
08,01sagas: i blend in with all the other pinkie pie cosplayers :P
0,5yeah I can see it.

Saturn: : O Pinkie pie?
08,01VioletLynnScraton: exactly
08,01VioletLynnScraton: my hair is actaully naturally very curly, and i've had it long for years
oh WOW

Okay.

One million years
:P
._.
0,5Actually
Close enough.
0,5I think it has been one year
:I
I've been here 9-10 months I guess. But not a frequenter very often
