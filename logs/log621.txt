Aw....so thats why i dont get to see much...
1,11Because randomness.
11,01But I think the worst is over for me now.
Nittany_Discord: Oh dang, i know that feel x_x
Hello everypony! :)
twilight_sprinkle, it's not the music
*awkward silence*
Erock made a gangnam style meets metal =D

hi saber
Sabershy: Hello!
it's how out of the blue it is
holy carp! http://derpy.me/bIHvp
ooops
hi Sabershy
11,01Yeah. It's torture.
hello Sabershy
twilight_sprinkle - i guarantee you, Gangnam Style is going to become the new RickRolling at the rate it's going
that's why people like it
holy carp! Dken2021
that being said, ALL CHAT: YOUR MISSION - turn Gangnam Style into the 'new Rick Roll'
does anyone here knows how Rick roll began?
unless you watch the movie first, then i guess it won't suck so bad
MirrorImage it hasn't already?
MirrorImage: at least rickroll had good singing and a point to it, gangam style is just crappy pop thats catchy and earns them money, its all they need
Trolololo became the new Rickrolling a few years ago
Canadian_Brony - not that i know of
I'm baaaack
CrimsonPhoenix: Check Know Your Meme.
CrimsonPhoenix it began as Duckroll on a image board somewhere

You do realize that most of us here are messed up in our own special ways anyway, right?
you do not realize how much I had to search for this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX68XhPs--k
11,01I guess.
Yeah, lol
00,02i cant get my beta key for smite to work
11,01We couldn't act like this in public, though.
:(
00,02"incorect syntax neat '='"
11,02Dat LadyCanary :D
No, I mean, I bet most of us here are IRL messed.
00,02this thing is full of bugs i somehow manage to find
^_^
11,01Yeah.
In our own special ways, some of which are more obvious than others.
Ohai LC! o/
And some of which are easier to cope with than others.
Where are you putting it in Phase4?
Aspergers, depression, minor fragile x, anxiety

At least here in regs, we really don't have a right to be intolerant.
00,02Barbetos, ingame
:)...what shall I post tonight...so many vids to choose from....
11,01You have Aspergers?
yay
And we watch bloody ponies, for Celestia's sake.
11,01Or are you just being general?
Whose Line
Phase4 what is it exactly?
General.
SuperBrony64: Play Just Dance on Wii and make sure there's a cam. :D
Cypresswolf I'm covering
dammit
Nittany_Discord, high functioning
I've got my own issues that I don't talk about because that would mean self-analysis and that ends badly.
11,02Spell-of-Gaming: Oh mai o////o
I'm covering "Whose Line"
thats the only qualifier anyone has attached to it
I have nothing whose line related
I know i have My fair share of problems
And psychology doesn't work well with a mirror.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtorTGaqf5Q This is a funny Whose Line
the anxiety might not be a condition and rathter an aritfact of aspergers, i'm mostly over it now
is it for Smite Phase4?
yes
00,02yeah
I'll just share my new findings
Polydunami I love that one
Ah okay. You need to put it in at a website: https://account.hirezstudios.com/login.aspx
11,01I've been accused of having it, and I'm wondering if I do. I'm intelligent and an excellent problem solver, but I have social problems.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf6__NZ3Hgg Her voice still gets to me. "Hush Now, Quiet Now" cover
Just Dance looks fun
Welcome to the ranks of most intelligent people on this Earth.

00,02THANK YOU
00,02IT FINALLY WORKED
Login, and then look for the Games tab, then activate key I think
Nice
11,01I mean, I took high-level math for fun in college.
00,02Barbetos, i was trying that, but my old account is bugged
I have great social skills, but regardless of how much i love problem solving, i suck at it :D
imagine an internet, where there were no arguments whatsoever
I have it too, but yet to play it. Let me know if you do decided to try it Phase4. I will join you.
11,01I can learn a coding language quickly.
Old account? Did you play Global Agenda?
STREAM

11,01Well, maybe not that hard.
Oh and I am so excited for Brony Fan Fare. Getting to meet fellow brony state bronies will be best birthday present ever

So you can help me with any math questions i have? :$

i think otakon ragequit
Dang you computer
XBOX?
Phase4: I'll pass, give it to someone who would truly enjoy it
Why? Because life is like a DnD game, and we only have so many points to spend.
11,01Could solve that with a taylor series XD
:L
11,01See.
H GODNESS
11,01I'm doing math!
11,01Lol.
/me starts college in a week
11,02Whoever has an Xbox 360 and Xbox Live Gold is free to join my party :)
00,02FSCK YEAH, BORDERLESS WINDOWED MODE
00,02i could stream this
to bad i dont have a Gold membership currently :<
Anyone who can combine insane intelligence and social skill without a lot of practice is hax and ought to be either nerfed or banned.
11,01I'm thinking of going back to school.
Lol!
XBOX HURRY UP AND POWER ON
Anypony have psn?
eh, i'm going to go play some Brave Fencer Musashi. Swear that game should've been on the t100 list earlier
what are you playing?
Nittany_Discord, social interaction just doesnt quite make sense to you?
SuperBrony64 Too bad it's 5:34am here mate. I think I've spoken to you before.
FlutterShyFan8895 I got one, but no PSP/PS3
aww...:) Can't post the next vid - but if you havent seen it, look up The Garden by mmmandarineorange
gO FASTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRr
Maybe we're gonna watch G4.
My computer decided to be a silly filly and hibernate on me ._.
SuperBrony64: Sorry. I don't have either. :<
11,01No. It's just complicated.
my gold membership ran out 4 days ago :<
Oh dear
hey therer CiderIsForDrinking
twilight_sprinkle: :D
11,01I don't like to go out and do things frequently.
Although, I might be on in about... 25 mins SB.
heres the big one that tells you wether or not you have aspergers
11,02Come on, we can't have a live Pony reaction video without ponies willing to talk in the party :D
Nor do i
People are more complicated than high-level mathematics. Science fact.
Nittany_Discord, when you see someone who's sad, do you also feel sad
i would talk so much id have people wishing id shut up
SuperBrony64: AkamaruZX is me...
i think the universe would blow up
Wait 25 mins SB, then I should be on.
I didn't have gold for like a year
I hate actually going to meet people, but if i have to (say like, for class) I will.
11,01I do hate to see people sad.
love to , but I don't have a 360, and even if I do, my connection might be crap anyways
11,02Unfortunately, I can't capture my voice on stream, but if you're in the party, you'll hear me :)
SuperBrony64 ponies? You should have warned me in advance! I'll grab the Fresca
Phase, isn't that one for psychopaths? Lack of empathy?
Skype anyone? i have to leave text chat to go on my ps3 :(
SB - whatcha playing?
does it trigger an intrinsc emotional response though
11,01It's just in real life, I never know how to comfort them.
11,01Especially females.
11,01I don't know Phase4.
Aegis Wing? :P
your a maybe
Females are so bad for me, its my male friends i dont know how to comfort x_x
*arent
Castle Crashers?
Reikim, probably, had i grown up different i could be a very not nice person
Scott Pilgrim?
No I mean
SuperBrony64: If only you we're doign htis on teh computer and on Skype :/
11,01I kind-of choose to stay away from it.
*this
What have you in mind?
this is one time I kidna want a 360, but I'd have to pay alot just to stay online, which is total bullsh*t.
We're gonna watch ponies on XBOX
:I
11,01I hate assholes and fear them a bit IRL.
*the
Castle Crashers!
:D
should make a mobile Brony app
11,01Since even a little criticism can hurt me.
Psychopaths just have a demonstrable lack of empathy and sense of social responsibility. In a sense they're just disjointed.
You do realize they are putting Castle Crashers on Steam, right?
but yeah, empathy is one of the things that people aspergers lack, you have to learn it
:) If Im still up after this stream (if noone else takes over) I'll post the bedtime story again ;)
um SB64 it says you odnt exist
brb, I'll get my xbox set up now.
at all
Wut
11,02Guess I don't exist :<
hello voice
What is going on?
Oh I get it he's playing Wolfenstein 3D! :3
yay a voice
who's voice is that?
SuperBrony64 You exist in the silly universe.
11,01If someone comes in depressed IRL, I wouldn't know how to act.
What is aspergers exactly?
wolfenstein!!
11,02:D
hello
can i get your xbox gamer tag in chat
11,01It's a light form of autism.
maybe the xbox is crazy
11,01From what I read.
RaveBrony, one of the many, many , MANY forms of autism
fuck it mines Owning The Hand
Netflix Canada! Y U no have ponies?
lol
Woah
KILL ME
What
Aspergers is, I believe a form of high-functioning autism, characterized by lack of empathy among other stuff.
/me kills flutter_spin
OH god kids
11,01It's actually fairly new since the disease didn't officially exist when I was born.
Meh I havent done much today, been playing alot of Mario Kart 7 and Starforce 3
the best way i can descirbe it emotinally is detatched
I dont fully know what autism is either. I hear it all the time, but never really read up on it.
Basically, Aspergers is social awkwardness in genetic form.
If anypony cares. My Skype is "Ponies47" if you care to add me. :P
11,01I care about things. I care too much in fact.
Also, Nitt, Aspergers has been around since 1944.
Canadian_Brony same here at mexico
dat random singing
11,01I care too much about what people think sometimes.
i have all the emotions, i have all the senses, i get the signals from body language, but they dont 'connect'
Pony should pony pony
11,01Reikim: Didn't know what.
SuperBrony64: what is your LIVE tag man?
My skype is cachi01^_^
Ponies47 kay I guess, I have a skype but no one to talk to
WHOA
cachi01|mobile atleast Youtube has every ep.
WOAH
JESUS
Spademagnes[R]: Hey! What's up?
WUT
Hi there!
yes he is Pinkies4thWall
aspergers has existed for as long as humans where humans :P
Dken2021: Plenty of ponies on Bstate on Skype XD
11,01But anyway, the fact that I'm so sensitive to criticism is why I don't like online gaming.
11,02Dat preloaded Xbox 360 music...
infact i had a cat you could call autistic
if anyone wants my skype, it's dken2021
11,02otakon: SuperBrony64 :)
Wuuut...
o
Issues with social interaction, narrow interests, speech issues, lack of empathy
11,01Because I hate how people get so hateful there.
makes sense actually
Autism is where people cant communicate well?
well SB64 your xbox gamertag would help to know
Motion and motor control, gaze avoidance
just saying
11,01Unfortunately, I can become just as bad as them.
MY EARS!
Other stuff
I'm not even logged into Skype. Hogs RAM.
RaveBrony, its more than that but yeah
i added you ponies47
minecraft! :P
Ah...
Also, Aspergers hasn't been around forever.
Minecraft?
It was a mutation that cropped up at some point, and keeps cropping up.
Awwwwkward.
lol
ohai DashWithRainbows.
thats possible, but its a fairly common mutation
naw. Talk about ponies.
Howdy Canadian_Brony.
Either that or the human mind is just really fucked up...which it is.
DashWithRainbows when did you aquire the '+'?
11,01It is.
LOL
wut?
Smile! You're on Candid Camera! :)
What
BULLSHIT he doesnt exist
My ex's bro had autism... i tried talking to the guy and i got th esleeper hold and a knife to my face... :'(
Why don't you have a seat right there? Just take a seat right there.
The size of Trixies horn?
Canadian_Brony Saxy set the mode I think today since I'm part of the art team.
ok
11,01I'd like to see research advance to where we can treat and cure mental disorders without medications, ECT (brain zaps), or surgery.
PONY'S! :[
the human mind is what you get if you have a billion monkies randomly connect neoruons and build a brain, one of them happens to work
That's called therapy and it works to an extent.
ew ponies
its the ultimate form of order from chaos
ponies are gay.
UHF yes
11,01Therapy worked well for me.
heh. RockaDoodle
there we fuckin go
Therapy is the way to treat mental disorders.
Ponies? Ponies are for little girls =P
old movie.
therapy never worked for me
More or less.
Ive never been to therapy... although ive been told i need it..
11,01But since I've been out of it and since moving back home, I relapsed into severe depression.
dat anime
Well that sucks.
ah man i was kid when i saw that,classic
Oh nuts
anime? :( anything else?
all you could do to me was show me whats going on, i had to figure it out
Dat Wilfred image
Im in love with a pony
dat fanservice on the cover
MUSHISHI
Nothing is better than a guy licking another guy's face.
SGT FROG
OH GOD YES
Rex_Mundi: which pony?
11,01And therapy is expensive.
I've been threatened with therapy.
11,01But it works wonders.
I liked Neds Declassified
Ruby Gloom? :3
flutter_spin: I love Ned's Declassified.
Currently, Applejack
Danny Phantom? Danny Phantom.
Gabriel Iglesias
jimmy neutron
Oh ho ho, Happy tree friends.
no. Not any Happy Tree Friends
Dken2021: What's your Skype username?
Therapy...
AjIsAwesome same here
All i do when im depressed or upset about something is 'verbally' beat the hell out of myself in the mirror... Maybe thats why i need therapy :D
Ponies47 dken2021
I think we already saw that episode.
flutter_spin: Oh God no! D:
boooo ponies are gay
I couldn't stand the idea of wasting the time on it.
Oh boy this one
11,01I had therapy during my last semester of college. It wiped my depression and anxiety out and got my life in order.
Dken2021 i added you :)
I came here for ponies dang it! :[
Hearts and Hooves Day?
Too much to do, not enough time.
I dont know any other way to deal with such things
Nonononononono.
Dken2021: Okie
PAUNCH
Nothing happens at the right time.
cachi01|mobile yaI got ya
needs a little bit more GLITTER
It needs more glitter!
I'm never at my laptop when I'm inspired.
it needs all the glitter!
Alot of glitter!
lol YES
Why this episode though?
G3 ponies would be fun to watch
I vote for yes!

11,02flutter_spin: Because it's there.
RIFF
SO awesome dash
lol
RIFF
RIFFTRAX PLS
RIFF
11,01I spend too much time on here. That's why I took a walk today.
goddamnit, that ytp ruined this episode for me forever
in order to make fun of that is
11,02It had the chance to /NOT/ be there, but it chose to exist, therefore, we must watch it.
lol was that a JAWS reference?
11,01Because being here wasn't doing anything to make me feel better.
inb4 france
^^
and all the desynci
11,01But walking half a mile worked wonders.
twilight_sprinkle: That's why I don't watch pony ytps anymore.
JAPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
SuperBrony64 That, and CheriMac 5ever.
Funny hearing your voice SB
man im bored
dammit, computer's being a d*ck
Nah, it was being here in general.
BIG
And sucks
time to sing the song of our people! :)
Although manechat could depress anyone, at times.
AJIsAwesome: it wouldve been easier to forget if Nittany didnt stream it every time :P
Yeah.
lol it id
scuffed up floor
*is
I swear to God, I remember CheriMac starting the shipping wars against Fluttermac.
MIND BLOWN
11,01Cheerliee's a whore.
When I was younger "Happy Tree Friends" scared the (squee) outta me O~O
11,01:p
so many mean new viewers :(
11,01No. I love Cheerilee.
Nittany_Discord: :D
Fat pony
Nittany_Discord: damn you, all i see is that ytp when i watch this!
Ponies47 glad i wasnt the only one
hey its the pony from the Goonies
look Pinkie :P
11,01twilight_sprinkle: Me too. Sorry. XD
I don't really pay attention to shipping conflicts :P
this episode is pretty light on the drinking
sus
G2 Bon bon was a fat pony too
And half of them, at least, aren't really all that great conversation.
I had to take care of a Trojan virus in my computer, did I miss anything?
It's really a problem of numbers.
Damn those Trojans
Too many people, less of a chance of good conversation.
not much
I stopped watching pony ytps becuase it ruined the episodes and the characters as well for me.
11,01And average age.
YESBECAUSE THIS IS HOW LOVE WORKS
CiderIsForDrinking: SB is streaming with a bunch of xbox friends
can i keep you?..
Mhhm
Confound these trojans
Mental age, let's mind.
cheerilees a whoooore
11,01It's why things like Maid Hour are more dangerous to do.
cachi01|mobile: CONFOUND THOSE DOVER BOYS!
CHEERILEE'S A WHOOOORE
11,01Since the teenagers will throw it to R34.
Song! DRINK!!
Skype why you derp out on me!?!?! :[
I love her voice RIGHT HERE
Yeah... i remember it awhile ago. Such a fun hour :)
I'm sure there are some younger viewers who are quite mature, and older viewers who are not.
FUNERAL
11,02But...i liek silleh :<
dat funeral
IT IS CANNON
11,01You're right. It's maturity.
Average mental age is still down the tubes, though.
Caramel
Polydunami just the singing voice
SuperBrony64: thats you?O.o
Damn it Caramel
I meant this song :S
11,02Dat jelly pony
And then you get the people who are just irritating in general.
Damn it Whooves
NIEGH Gusta~
lies! caramel is gay
he jelly
GUSTA
And then the trolls
dat jelly
all the good ones are tekkeeeen
Derpy's brother?
Molestia approves?
Jelly pony is so fucking fin XD
Fun*
Yeah, i was just about to say.
Hugh Jelly
Super fast!
And then I move over here pretty much permanently.
but they talk about boobies, thats mature right :P
qbert ponies
Yup!
eeyup
CUE CREDITS
11,01If we had more maturity in chat, things like RP would be more acceptable since we wouldn't have to worry about people taking it too far.
/me bashes his head on the keyboard in an attempt to forget the YTP
You get those people who just want to destroy it for others.
cue credits
I don't know what ARE doing SuperBrony64?
lol Q-bert
twilight_sprinkle: it will never leave
/me joins with twilight_sprinkle
No!
Hey
We should do Maid Hour in here.
twilight_sprinkle: IT WILL NEVER LEAVE
11,02idk, what ARE doing is doing?
what are we watching?
lol
otakon: :'(
11,01Maybe.
Wow that lag
I assume we're all mature enough.
This episode is really light on the drinking according to my list.
Heart and Hooves on SB's xbox with a party of friends
problem is /nick will show up in #bronystate too
Spademagnes[R]: it's lIVE
11,01Yeah.
Damn, that's true.
What YTP?
those cute eyes
I wonder what would happen if he used both legs...........
otakon: i knew i shouldnt have watched ytps for this show..
is it juat me or is it hard not to sing along with them
She'll buck him!
twilight_sprinkle: it'll ruin your mind
11,01And if people start changing to their maid nicks, it'll trigger a maid hour in main.
as long as the average maturity is high enough, chats can regulate themselves
I remember when i first came to Bronystate, theres was a bit of RP, but it was silly and didnt get out of hand.
lol what are you talking about
lol.
inb4 PAWNCH
twilight_sprinkle: Same here. It KILLS the episode and the characters.
so far, I am on 1 drink for this episode.
otakon: it already has. just like the time i was watching a crapton of hitler parodies, when walked out i kept seeing hitlers out of the corner of my eye
11,01RP issues started with a mod we had called Octavia.
Smacking others with fish, and 'throwing' things
Wow i didnt know they had a MLP FIM orchestra album :)
That's Fluttershy.
you dont say?
lol
History lesson?
11,01When people would RP about her butt.
dat apple tree
11,02Scootaloo is best CMC Pony.
Bloomberg
11,01All about Octavia's plot.
O.o
I disagree
SuperBrony64 agreed
whats with the backround talk?
false, Sweetie is best cmc
...What.
0,14Ah those days =P
Scootaloo is best cmc
No Applebloom
Wait, the Octavia we helped in the charity?
Eulshy: group of people :P
11,01Yep.
Mac the TOOL MANE Taylor lol
never mind haha
CMC are best CMC
Totally Applebloom
Eh this is amusing, SB doing commentary on it this time
Sweetie Belle is best pony BTW
How did that hammer not fall on Applebloom's head?
Equestria gets XBL?
Eulshy: it's the LIVE party that SuperBrony64 is apart of, and one of them is watching the stream on PC
Wasnt here whe Octavia was a mod :(
Spademagnes[R]: it's Netflix
*I wasnt
11,02Can you hear me? o.o
Scootaloo needs her own episode
i gotta go use my ps3 now:(.... bye everypony!:)
Pinkies4thWall: turn your PC down
I hear tons of voices
SuperBrony64: Yes.
11,01And I don't want Maid Hour to ever become the next Octavia's Plot.
Is that bad?
SuperBrony64 I dunno. Say "Rainbow Dash is best pony."
no no no
man those EYES :$ so cute lol
Canadian_Brony, why Rainbow Dash?
I wonder what would happen if i join the party lol
OH COME ON
OH COME ON!
Canadian_Brony: that's not how you spell Fluttershy :P
OH COME ON
OH COME ON!
CrimsonPhoenix because she is best pony IMO
dat oh come on echo
Hell, I'm almost glad to be a newbie, for once.
what they said!
otakon I wasn't spelling Fluttershy
Canadian_Brony, but Rarity is best Pony
I mustve missed the bad maid hours.
Canadian_Brony: yes you were, you just had a derpy moment is all
otakon he was spelling pinkie pie
Twilight is best pony

Rape time?
Sweetie Belle is best pony BTW
TWILIGHT WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!
cuteness overload
*2 DRINKS!!
otakon: btw fluttershy is worst pony
FINALLY!!!
I wonder what that other book is that she was going to give them?
11,01Like one where some member RP'd sawing off Ponies47's wing, and he was RPing bleeding all over the channel.
WHY WOULD YOU GIVE THEM THAT BOOK
4!!!
RD IS WORST PONY
BUCK YES!!!
*was*
That's a little overboard.
twilight_sprinkle: no, that would be Diamond Tiara
^^
And I fail to see how being a maid leads there.
I missed like, 1 and then the next time it was brought up, i remember Nitt telling me that some stuff went down.
I am on 5 drinks for this episode.
otakon: ok, her and diamond tiara
inb4 punch
well I'm getting tired
It's okay to not like things, but don't be a dick about it.
twilight_sprinkle: NO NO NO
otakon: tiara is just a kid tho
AJIsAwesome: its the storybook from the first episode
why connection, why you abandonming me now? ;_;
perrrrrrrrfect
twilight_sprinkle: YOU DO NOT GODDAMN LUMP FLUTTERSHY WITH FUCKING DIAMOND TIARA!
GLITTER
which is new considering it's only 8 minutes to 1 AM
Quick_Thinker: Canterlot Gardens is gonna be awesome! Can't wait to meet up with you ^^

Be that giiiiirl!~
Assuming all goes well.
I wouldnt Dare get the leaked stuff tho... that was quite a shame...
I'm guessing Applebloom secretly wants a piggie back ride...
I think Fluttershy's almsot done, based on evidence.
Buffered in midair
They went looking for her VA a while ago, I took that to mean they had progress.
heeeres SHMOOPY DOO
No use for doors...
SCREW DOORS AGAIN!
Ponies47 u going to canterlot gardens roght?
And they had the OP version a while ago, so there's at least some work.
Cheerilee is a TAAAANK
Right*
cachi01|mobile: Most likely
Why?
So, I guess we'll see Fluttershy as a character release...sometime in the fall, and then Rainbow Dash with the full release.
Ponies47 say hello to max gilardi for me lol

0,14iirc, they're planning to have everyone playable at Canterlot Gardens
I get some info and then I postulate.
0,14and that's in two months
To be honest, this is my opinion on shipping. If you do though, you're welcome to.
Your flanks are so grounded
What ever happened to PonyKart? I heard about that a While ago, but dont hear anytihng else about it.
Saxy, if that happens, I will cry manly tears of joy.
Ponykart's still up.
moral: shipping is bad and you should feel bad!
11,01I thought the FiM team as going to stop doing updates since their game got leaked?
It's open source, they've got a background character designer open.
11,02Derpy's flank was grounded.
Unless a pony has magic ability, hoof made construction isnt put together well - how do those houses stay up in the first place?
no pony can pony two ponies to pony
PaladinDrakkenwolf unless it's an official one

They were amazingly chill about it after they calmed down a bit.
Dken2021: but aside from Cadence and Shining Armor, there is no canon ships out there
I'm not into shipping, but if you are then I'm cool with it. Just don't force me into a conversation about it. I will drone on forever.
That tease
And then a bit later they released the full RD stage theme, which is badass.
Next!
PaladinDrakkenwolf ms cake and mr cake
brb
oh right...
THat needs the caption: U MAD BRO?"
I still prefer the leaked version of RD's theme. You can tell the difference between the two though.
11,01And you can think about how sos you are when you're...
Is it just me or am I the only one who cant get Friendship is fabulous out of my head?
Some peep is behind somewhere :P
Play Friend in Deed and try to sing Smile
If you ship more power to you. I won't judge. But don't shove shipping down my throat. I've HAD it with other fanbases doing that to me.
I prefer the more refined version.

SuperBrony64 but.... they're never in a highschool....
The trouble is that teens actually take pointers from shows like this :P

Personally, I think the full version is just more balanced, tweaked, and altogether easier to listen to.
Wow, this theme fits RD very well :D
POR QUE

Actually, I wouldn't mind if the commentary broke suddenly :P
Arthur was one of the best freaking shows on PBS at the time. The books were great, too.

Pinkies4thWall: srs?
Canadian_Brony: Yep. Plus I can't look at the animation any more. I actually liked the first seasons of Johnny Test until CN decided to change everything about it.

I have a folder dedicated to him.
11,02The Adventures of Dinky Doo.
*Taht
WHAT WAS I SMOKING?!
this is basically inflation porn for children
Is this the crappy version of Peewee Herman?
Oh hey, Phase4, were you here when that guy told us about meeting Makkon?
Quick_Thinker you alright?

he's dying
this show is the best show ever

SuperBrony64: someone needs to make that miniseries/fanfiction
otakon who is?
WHat otakon said! I think somepony drugged me! O~O
the perspective on that building is all wrong
wow, i haven;'t seen so many of these shows since my sisters stopped watching em
It was pretty funny, because he didn't know Makkon yet.
NO
STOP TROLLING US YOU NIT
NO GODDAMMIT NO!
Ponies47: What did they drug you with?
SuperBrony64: PLEASE MAKE IT STOP!
LEAPFROG

Also, note Phase4, on that song: Art by Makkon.
Dken2021 compared to the PC version, it is very outdated. They recently got wolves.
YES YOU DO
oh
princess molestia is coming for you SuperBrony64...
Funny, innit?
Apparently he's focused more on the art than anything els
Reikim, wait, makkon made the image?
Wow, thanks guys, these are Great!
Yes
Yes Makkon did that.
wow, interesting

I guess it's good for if your PC is crap at running it
So far as I know, he does the art for all his songs.
Dken2021:or you just like the xbox
He's mentioned he'd like to pursue his art over his music. I had a slight panic attack.

SKin Packs
I didn't even know they were instrument blocks in Minecraft. Cool.

oh wow
So soothing :o
I have cried listening to that song.
AJIsAwesome "Note Blocks" you right-click them to change the note and put different blocks underneath it to change the instrument. You can either punch it once or power it with redstone to have it play a note.
I wrote a whole fanfic using (mostly) that song as inspiration.
Quick_Thinker is taken . . .
And it's probably the best thing I've ever written.
hmmph
I assume the cobble is blocked off lava
If I could have a song played at my funeral it would be that song.

AJIsAwesome godl and diamons are some of the most useful things in Minecraft. Diamonds can be used to make the strongest tools and armour in the game. Gold can make quick but fragile tools and show-offy armour, but it should be used to make clocks, powered rails, and other numerous goodies.

Fly wins: Fatality

if it's in a liquid state you can drink it
11,02Night Wrek :)
Thanks twilight_sprinkle. Good night!:)

g'night Wrek

Night Wrek.
SHMOOPY DOO!

Cya Wrek

so Buytoast , you must be bored of this place right now im guessing? :P
How dabuq do i get out of this mime xd
Mine*
Bronystate?
What?
Buytoast: si seniore
i've been coming here for about a year
ain't too bored of it yet
<.<
I've lost count of how many months I've been coming here
more than 3
who's streaming
SB64
cowvarkian: SuperBrony64
inb4 SuperBrony64 falls in lava
ah
Buytoast: mkay, i just figured you were trolling pretty hard today so i thought you were bored and not caring about ban :P
Daaaahhh
i ain't bein that bad today
Canadian_Brony: he did before? :D
dat lava
lol
But Buytoast your not even a brony, What do you do whenwe're watching ponies? O.O
dat name
that was me
hey now, i enjoy the show, i just hate the ponyfags
and it depends on the episode
Buytoast: whats a ponyfag then?
Buytoast: Oh. Sorry :$
the ones who hate the show and won't shut up about it, or the ones who force you to be a brony?
the people of the my little pony fandom that are absolutely disgusting and terrible
____fag isn't always derogatory
and force it everywhere
Don't we all?
Buytoast By ponyfag, I'm guessing you mean bronies who spout "love and tolerate." and post pony related things on things that are not pony related?
they give us a bad rep
mainly yes
ponyfag can mean any pony fan
holy sh*t dat lava
Buytoast: true, thats annoying, but tbh there are worse people than that in the community
oh, i know there are
psychological entertainment
*physical
psychological
you don't know that
or do you
im guessing
since i can understand that
aight sorry
man, i ain't even starting shit and people are gettin riled up
Buytoast: youre just that good :D
You see when I was still a young brony. The top thing to do was make my brother into a brony. Lucky for me CrimsonPhoenix knocked some sense into me before I got TO carried away :$
and suddenly daimond
a big beautiful bedazzling DIAMOND
. . .
twilight_sprinkle: It's a STONE, Luigi.
, , ,
twilight_sprinkle: :D
-_-
_O
that's a nice Tom you have there SuperBrony64, it would be a shame if something happened to it...
O_O
I get it now
tooke me that long
<3
Ponies47 ah, I was like that too, but then I realize it's just another fan thing, and I didn't do this withthe other thigns I like
the sprinkle part is actually her pornstar name from a ytp...but i just like it cuz it sounds cute :3
I didn't have to know that
ah yes
hot
pony
dick
I don't want to know that
Canadian_Brony: the more you know ~
Bed time for me... Good night all! Take care! :)
and now I can't erase if from my brains
*brain
g'night RaveBrony
Night RaveBrony
Buytoast: twilights a girl tho, she doesnt have a dick
bye RaveBrony
Dken2021: Yeah. I tryed but now I don't. All I really say is "If you ever get curious just watch a episode and see what you think"
Night RaveBrony
twilight_sprinkle Futanari for a reason.
but she's magic
Well good night.. its 1:11 here

Night Spademagnes[R]
bye Spademagnes[R]
ah futanari
I need to stay up and fill out an application from
*form
I think I have.
there's a few
I prefer images to clopfics.
So. I have my student ID for high school already. Still a bit nervoius :S
you better not be jerkin to ponies
<_<
>_>
this is the internet
Don't be silly!
we get off to absolutely everything
if it's humanized have at it
but if not then go find a farm instead
Um, no.
Ponies47 We get new ID's every year. We get them after half of the first semester is over.
dat Swedish hair fact
but I don't ant to be the guy, you see the things the kid has to deal with? floating apples, spikes, it's too much for me
Humanized, yes. Anthro, yes. Pony? No thanks mate.
Canadian_Brony: I see. I get mine when I turn in the boring paperwork :$
My temper gets worse when I break stuff in anger, then it, well crap, now this has to be replaced out of my pocket before someone else notices
I should get back to filling out this application . . .
anthor is dangerous territory
anthro*
Meh, like I care.
Anthropology?
anatomy's the killer
Canadian_Brony: Suddenly it has a whole new meaning XD
anyone who gets that reference
Ponies47 ah, starting off as freshman?
might as well call yourself a furry and fetch a comfy fursuit if you get off to anthro
Dken2021: Yesh :S
okay guys I'm off to bed
sleep weell
11,02Night otakon :)
g'night otakon
see you all later, SuperBrony64 thanks for the stream mate
otakon: dream of ponies
the whole mlp furry thing is pretty much just the result of adult/teen male hormones+a show bronies think about a lot that has acartoon ponies, its not that surprising
bye all
bye otakon
nighty otakon
Buytoast You do realize that dressing up in a fursuit is more in the furfag area, right?
well yeah
I do enjoy looking at anthros though.
no, twilight
So if that labels me as a furry, I don't care.
im cool with trolls :P
the problem is that the mlp fandom is internet-based
suit yourself
i like to troll sometimes too, im hip!
there is nothing wrong with appreciating anthro characters in a clean context
"Anthropology" is a story on fimfiction.net about Lyra and her continuing research about the mythical being called a "human"
I will make my house mob proof if it kills me! repeadedly!
lol so technically she's a "Humey" huh Canadian_Brony?
okay with that I'm out, g'night!
wha . . .
Athgaar: 4-chan based no less
g'night ota
dammit
im going to bed
who's streaming and punching rock
bye Spitfire
11,02Night Spitfire :)
I've read the first 2 chapters of Anthology, good fanfic
making fun of your voice would be too easy
Athgaar SB64
Athgaar: superbrony is
i am going to bed as well
g'night Spitfire
We should install beds in the chat so people don't have to leave.
bye Derpy_Hooves
Anthropology...whatever its called
night Derpy_Hooves
not to mention i don't even know who you are
minecraft question!: can i make smelting go faster?
Canadian_Brony: Have you read A Ghost Story?
no
Cypresswolf yeah, it's a story. Rated everyone. IIRC, tags are "Comedy", "Adventure", and "Human"
dovah: no
Night Derpy|Asleep
Dovah no
g
dammit
g'night Derpy|Asleep
the only way is to build multiple furnaces and split the workload
Cypresswolf never heard of it.
/me Still hasen't played Minecraft yet ;_;
Canadian_Brony: fuck... 200 iron ore going to take long time....
what does +v do
Dovah make lots of furnaces and split the workload.
Voice
Athgaar
make's you a voiced guy, with a +
btw is dinky being derpys daughter legit canon? i hope not
Canadian_Brony: i can do that? cool thanks
it's not
twilight_sprinkle no.
good
derpy is not the mother-type
twilight_sprinkle pretty much 95% of speculations is fan made
Dovah eeyup. I have an entire room in one house dedicated to smelting.
Dken2021: thats good
damn near everything in the poyfag fandom is fanon
of speculations? 100% by definition
why do you think veryone bitched everywhere when the luna episode came out
Canadian_Brony: Its a human in Equestria story - person dies, and finds a gateway to equestria in the afterlife but realizes he cant interact with Equestria's denizens - 18 chapters now http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23419/A-Ghost-Story
unless you count the ones thrown into the story
Canadian_Brony: lol this is my first house on survival so it isnt all that great yet :P
My mind is still bucked up from listening to that reading of "Cheerilee's Garden" O~O
Very good story
NEVER read that story
Buytoast: the rage at vinyls eye color was also funny
NEVER
Minecraft, eh?
Cypresswolf that's a cursed blessing, eh?
yep
people will always bitch about something if it doesn't fit in with their special hug boxing precious fandom
Cypresswolf . . . wait, yeah. I've heard that somewhere before.
Where is this guy?
hi Slenderman. In his mine.
I mentione it at least a week ago
I probably wasn't her
test?
*here for it
Hello Canadian_Brony.
hi Dken2021
/me says hi to slenderman
SuperBrony64 Protip: When starting a mining adventure / continuing one, always bring half a stack of wood.
Cypresswolf: Oh yeah, I read that. Didn't quite care for the snarky, superpowered protagonist, but it was pretty funny.
11,02>>
11,02<<
my chat is behind D:
/me throws pokeball at SuperBrony64
I'm still watching
11,02O.o
Dken2021 refresh stream and chat
/me is captured D:
I'm outta high school and i don't like your vocie
Fuck yeah
/me sings the pokemon-capture song

SuperBrony64 has a "silly filly" nature? Forget that. *releases SuperBrony64*
but that was the final fantasy victory fanfare
hehe, nice skin you got here
minecraft again, I see.
Havent found many pony fanfics, especially in a series, that keep me to the end - mainly read the short one offs
yeah lol, you sung the final fantasy song
Hello Bronystate
hi TheKatPony
not the pokemon one
allo TheKatPony
hello The_Browncoat
wups misping
hello TheKatPony

Athgaar SuperBrony64 is streaming. Yes he does.
I have about 2 dozen fanfic links I'll eventually go back and read through
I meant in minecraft
a place where he can go and make a few more picks
Yes he does.
in Minecraft
Cypresswolf: lol i have at least 74
how would you do the skins for the 360 version? unless you connect with your MC account I guess
fanfics to read that is
One I read recently that started out good, but didnt care for the ending was called Dont Go Outside - kindof a Resident Evil crossover
lol
There's a part 2 to it, but dont care to read it
Dovah, Cypresswolf, 178. I am super procrastinator :P
Petrified_Discord: .... ...... ............ ummm
Yay i made nether portal =D
lol ^^
I'm trying to write a fanfic. Currently, I'm in concept and story development.
Canadian_Brony: Spoilers?
HiE

poor proygon, forever doomed for not appearing in an anime ever again, even though it was pikachu's fault
i cant wait for 1.4 i wanna spawn a ghast in a portal in creative and someone in its on survival mode and it attacks him ill spawn 100 LOL
Read one a little bit ago, Luna Eats an Oreo
cachi01|mobile: i lost my first diamond pickax trying to make a nether portal, i succeded but i fell into lava :p
Lol
im so evil
i beleave it started in 200
2000
digimon's not that much of a ripoff
lol
Cypresswolf Ah, that one. Nice story seeing that it is really short and pointless.
i hate lava, I've lost count on how many times it's killed me.
00,02http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m94hv2f8o41r2sb8go1_400.jpg
DashWithRainbows it's a one-shot, right? If it is, that's the point of a one-shot.
ohai Phase4
and the best part of 1.4 i can bring my wolves with me to the nether :3
00,02dat minecraft on the xbox
totally forgot it was a one-shot.
Mmmm
TheKatPony:DONT TOUCH THE MMMM
:) put a smile on my face - I'd like a sugar high from just one oreo :3 a whole pack will last me 2-3 days
Funfact: Porygon came before Digimon.

digimons a simillar name to pokemon...
i wonder how long itll take them to dig out of there
ya don't say
those fucking barrels did it...
:D I still have the link to fanfic about Nittany
I love how those guys are just letting SuperBrony do all the work xD
How I feel about the stream: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b97zJxKEqAk
pocket monsters, digital monsters, meh
no non-pic links during stream please Petrified_Discord
written by lowfn - forgot about this one, I'll read it tomorrow - http://www.fimfiction.net/story/44655/Nittany-Discord%27s-first-adventure
it's very difficult to get two people to hit something in a 1x2xn staircase
constructively at least
lol Cypresswolf, be scared of that story.
It's crazy :<
oh wow, fimfiction
I'm already half crazy, it wont be a big loss, I'm sure :P
i haven't been on that site in some time

I wish I could remember the first fanfic I read - was a bit twisted had at least 2 chapters

Buttflustered?

Cypresswolf: So is it a thing to name HiE fics "Over the Edge and ..."?
XD ^^
yeah im a paciFIST too
i actually didn't know if it was him or not
probably?
so, i have 4 iron golems guarding my house, that's good for a beginner right?
yes
they'll kill you in the dark of the night
also incredibly pointless but yes
yay!
oh wow that sound effect
lol that scared me
is there a stream?
a creeper blew a hole in my house (which is on water so it flooded) so i vowed to make my house mob proof
yes
it's very dark though
Magical_Pablez94: refresh
who's the streamer?
64
Superbrony
okay.
The stream is a pie.
a falsehood
no ponies?
There are no ponies, only Zuul!
you must know the one possilbe truth, there is no spoon
Hai
anyway i am not sure that refreshing the chat client of my phone will help me to watch the stream, DerpDash.
oh ok
there are only ponies
hello Gunthler

Nick's gyros might be
Cypresswolf i quote DerpDash

Fridge better not be open. Don't wanna let the cold air out.
There's a family-run pizza place that has 24-hour service.

Cypresswolf: All that stuff + bowl = snack

dovah: that's just bad luck then
what do you need a desert for
card collection?
yeah i could use some cacti.
00,02reboot time
this map could use more sand
all they're good for is decoration and green dyes
Rare Rarity card. Huh. :/
well...Bear Grylls would eat it for sustenence for sure....*sigh* this will certainly be an experience *goes to try it* probably going to regret this....
and causing pain to things.
there are better ways to cause pain to things
Trololololo :3
I can see the surface!
I regret watching any of it
Come on....
JUST GET IN MY TRAÑ
TRAP
eveeryone and their cat has watched FiW

is that overkill?
no
make the golems

^
Dovah: not when ur a pyromaniac
also use your snow golems
and make a snow fort
bones
depends on the animal
wolves, bones
right click on them with a bone i believe
Fuck up college. Ruin life. GG.
walk up to one and right-click
for cats it's raw fish but be careful, they like to run around
ok then what is better or can i have both?
you can have both
yay!
cats= raw fish if i am correct, wolves=bone, all the others follow you if you have wheat in your hands.
but he asked about taming
then there is slime, my greatest pray...
i told him about taming and about something else.
I can NEVER find those things...
cause i am bored
Alright, I'll see you gus later. :)

Petrified_Discord Deutsch silly
or no mods are awake
All other's voice by Rina- Chan
*voiced
Yeah i saw that animation in the morning at equestria.net
Equestrianet*
Naïve is one of the few common English words to use the umlaut
that's because it's not an English word at all
Equestrianet.org
Athgaar yes it is it's in the English dictionary
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87oeJOteWIg&feature=related
it's a loanword though
EquestriaSkynet
So is every other word in English.
depending on how loose you want to get with the definition, yeah
HI GUYS!
hi
HI TROLLGHOST
Blond and Blonde is a fun weirdness in English.
i actually came on the chat 5 minutes ago and was just being dazzled by your riveting conversation
Hi thelonepony :)
hay everypony
Only common word with Gendered forms
tart and tarte?
I thought it was always "blonde"
Nope
Hye thelonepony
*Hey
cachi01|mobile hai there
hai Ponies47
Ohai trollghost
Penis and pingas
Dumorimasoddaa: so its blonde when using it on a chick, but blond when using it on a dude
Gray and Grey
grey.
colo(u)r
that how i always spell it
colour
POW http://grammarist.com/spelling/gray-grey/
trollghost yep French lone word that kept gender
We have a few very obscure other words
hey, HEY, you speak our language mofos, you speak OUR language, english, your gonna do it right
so you say colour
But they tend to be Latin lones
So Rina-Cahn is going to be at Canterlot Gardens... EPIC! :D
nah
and favourite?
we took a lot of stuff from French
*Rina-Chan
its only ONE extra vowel, or cant your brains understand how to parse that many vovels?
vovels
Meh rina chan is in everything :/
unless its the word hamburger.
duke > rina chan
wonder if Rina will be at Equestria LA
Rina-Chan the one who voice colgate for a video?
thelonepony she voices every freaking thing
*crickets*
In all fuxking videos
This is why my favorite word is tmesis. Because who needs vowels?
thelonepony: Yeah. And Twilight in the Pony.MOV series, ect
into a bra?
DUKE > RINA CHAN
trollghost least this time I didn't read bar...
trollghost: u like anti jokes?
no
oh
Cause that has happend
i like gross out homour and regular jokes
Then I've read fig and fish before
So yeah fuck letters
They hate me
oh shit i spelt humour wrong
I thought twilight was voiced by a friend of maz
Max*
/me kills self out of irony
that's not how irony works
Knock Knock!
go away.
Athgaar: What if he kills himself with a bar of iron?
or a clothes iron
or iron ore
that's not "out of irony"
or an iron ingot
Athgaar it's ironic to misspell something after just hammering on about how you spell things
its "out of ironing"
not quite
iron bucket?
Buck it
Aha
knock knock.
who's there
Come in.
Athgaar, friend, amigo, pal, if i ironed my face with a clothes iron whilst bashing myself with it, that is dying "out of ironing"
a shizno
Athgaar: to
3:04....
3:04 here
DerpDash: gtfo we dont want mormons here
at my doorstep
T-T
go take your fancy fliers elsewhere
trollghost you don't use "out of" in that sence
It would be by
Dumorimasoddaa I do
Well you are wrong.
also it was a play on words, not an actual sentence.
[/thread]
that was odd
Dumorimasoddaa: Dafuq is a "sence"? :P
Guess what......
Sense
I cant hold it anymore
cachi01|mobile: All those cats?
Then drop it?
every cat
I gotta go to sleep...

Athgaar: ever wondered where ectoplasm comes from?
03 heheh, I kept trying, but it was hard
trollghost: honestly, no
Athgaar: well, now you know...
03 I hate it when cool things happen for only one time...
03 I'll keep trying and see what I did. I'll try to recreate it
I was always satisfied with "ghosts" and no further details

hi there
/me gives you tea and cookies
Hello Pearly and MASF123
hey there, how are you?
hai Pearly and MASF123
I dl'd this yesterday and gave it a whirl; I could never get my rocket to angle properly, always went straight up unless I tried to adjust it, which always ended up with me over-torquing and losing all stability
00,02tSpx|Reading, use adv sas
Now, I got 6,000km up going straight up, but it was still a pain
Phase4: I did.
Oh just fine thanks Pearly :)
:D
00,10you ran in to your couplers
Phase4: When I try to adjust pitch/yaw with SAS on, it won't let me change course from straight up, and the moment I take it off I just start tumbling
My name is Pearly Pie, :D
00,02woahj
00,02i accidentally opened this in a new window
00,02one sec
Dat chat
00,02there we go
AdamTheDuck: He and I have roughly the same settings, including the black bg, monotype font
the monotype looks weird but looks oh sooo puerty on my end
it looks rather ugly if it were gold
00,02font was the default
00,02black backgound i had to set
00,02the default grey is ugly
00,02Macvey kerman, i'm feeling good about this, are you?
00,02he looks like he's been labotimized
I am on mac, using xchat aqua... black bg white font coloir
lol
Well the firework in the middle was cool
i just use the sites chat server
But then you hit the horizon
/me hands out tea and cookies with a golfd ribbin around everything for everypony
gold*
alexxm I'm often trolling 1 or 2 other chans, and it's easiest for me to do that in a 3rd party client.
00,02every now and again i get worried that i might have too much rocket
Phase4 Lawl.
There is never... too much rocket...
Are those all solid-fuel boosters?
00,02tSpx|Reading, eyup
...
00,02it used to be nothing but, except i need a bit more controll for this misson
Phase4 What mission is that today?
haha
00,02same as last night
Phase4 Operation Luna Beta?
00,02go real high, then turn around and go the other way
Oh kk
00,02yay
00,02it didnt instantly explode
haha I should name my mac Big macintosh next time if I want to ponyfy my computer
600km*
What's on the stream right now?
I only have chat embed
MASF123: Kerbals, rockets and explosions.
MASF123: It's Ps4 playing Kerbal and listening to Makkon
ded chat btw
pm me a link?
or link it
what kind of music
Let me ask you everypony a question... I know I am not alone on this... have you felt like you feel bored wqhen you can't wait til MLP comes on even though its reruns?
Pearly: I don't rewatch that many MLP eps, usually only on Movie Night.
Pearly: I really just miss canon MLP developments, new stories, y'know?
00,02so
00,02i'm getting bored of doing this misson legit
00,02add a cheat rocket?
00,02i'ma add a cheat rocket
Phase4: your game, you have fun how you want
If cheat rocket = more explosivo, then it's fine by me
I gave a booster 10,000 thrust once, it blew through my rocket and killed all the kerbals
they will die
00,02RD_is_awesome, i have legit rockets that crush themselves when i throttle up
00,02its very anoying
00,02stupid stage seperators
00,02weeeeeeeeeeeeee
00,02the rocket broke itself off
weeeeeeeeee indeed
tSpx|Reading, yeah. I just watch whatever is on the hub for me
00,02so
00,02i cant go above min throttle
00,02or the rocket breaks
Hi

Exactly

Mythbuster's words of wisdom.
00,10so Phase4, have you ever just watched the title screen when it's the mun?
Lol, i love the mythbusters!
00,02Sumica, little bit
00,02sometimes theres a sand castle
00,10some times a kerbal goes rolling past
00,02i thought it was just the helmet
lol, I wonder if the NASA astronauts were tempted to make a sandcastle on the moon
I can't wait for the KSP team to add an entire solar system
00,02^
00,02i want to go to murz
00,02jeb likes this rocket
00,10that would be nice but they have alot of bugs in the sim to fix too

Well just wondering, i like it, and can speed rap it.
/me steals all of DaringDerpy's cookies
/me steals Agrolds hat
00,02do you know that if you go up from kerbin, and escape its gravity with a velocity of 10KM/s and are going the right way
noo, not my top hat:(
00,02you'll hit kerbin in about half a year

Anyways, Lauren Faust is epic...

Agrold: Kerbal Space Program

MixManiac: it's kinda inappropriate to advertise your stream during a stream here
WHAT?
lol
wow
You know, since we're already watching a stream?
Just trying to get myself known for my rapping? xD
MixManiac: Please ask a mod for permission to share non-image URL's during a stream
WAIT WHATY?
MixManiac: No one's mad!
there are enough other channels
Youa re?
MixManiac: Just, in the future.
Oh leave him be DaringDerpy , I don't think he intended to cause any harm. :)
just saying
Anyway, well, go look at the speed rap recording later when i finish, i just want feedback
Not really into raps though MixManiac , sorry. :/
More of an instrumental sorta guy.
same here
That and very meaningful lyrics in a song.
try ponychan. you will find interest there
no barriers
What're these two celestial bodies floating out in the middle of nowhere?
I'm loving this music that's playing right now. =)
Gold_Demona: Makkon, I believe. A lot of it's been Makkon anyway
tSpx|Reading: All of it actually :D
AdamTheDuck: 'Swhat I thought
It's most of the reason I keep the stream open. The mods play lots of good music. =)
Whether I stay active in chat or not
00,02stupid controls bug

Suddenly no music :(

Someone at the radio station's getting fired for that dead air
Do my comments go through when chat derps?
You said "suddenly no music" and then "damnit chat derped"
Ok so it does go through, cool.
Yeah, it's just nobody's talking. =P
Nah but I don't see my comments as well
Too busy watching the rockets I guess
For a sunday this is standard
Chat just seems to freeze and but I'm still able to type. :/
00,02stupid thing wont turn
Freeze? How can you tell when nobody's talking?
froze?
ded
that's how
Gold_Demona: That's the thing, I can't tell the difference so I occasionally type something in to see if my comment pops up
Gold_Demona: It's not a radio station, it's just Ps4 playing music.

This music :o its so calm

MaxTheBrony: It's Makkon, so it's likely to suddenly explode into awesomeness.
It's lovely. =D

MaxTheBrony: That's the beauty of Makkon.

Yeah, Tara's the one who started the whole "licious" thing. =P
Do i need to install anything to watch the stream or am i just doing it wrong? :S
I know that...but still.
The other VA didn't give a shit or something.
Then again it is Tara's thing she stole from a song. So...
00,02surprise game start
It's just that Tara's the only one who really dove into the fandom and claimed them as her slaves. =P
"Every week I get trolled by Tara Strong" :D Love that line in the Brony Song.
Alright thanks. I might check if i have the newest flash :D
Sometimes I wonder...about goin down under.

/me sighs
/me revives chat with a defribulator
O.O
/me realises this isn't Battlefield and remains ded.
CLEAR!
/me revives chat again
x_x
Fine...I'll just put it out of it's misery then.
/me holds magnum to chat's head
Any last wods?
:O
words
You got to revive chat Gears of War style
You mean run up and tap it on the shoulder?
They don't need some crummy morphein or defib
Real men just shout at downed soldiers and tap them and they instantly man the fuck up!
I like the morphein in Kane and Lynch
What game is this?
I always find it funny they stick the needle in my ass.
SirGanjalf: Guns of Icarus
thanks, AdamTheDuck
/me shouts at chat: MAN THE FUCK UP.
gonna play Gears 3 I guess.
See there, that's how you revive chat.
/me chat dies
OOOOH SHIT. :O
AdamTheDuck: Nah, battlefield style. Just generally touch them anywhere on the body with shock paddles and YOU'LL BE GOOD TO GO BUDDY.
FUUUUUU
what is this game
Shortcircuit42: Guns of Icarus
/me rushes the chat to nearest hospital
Oh noes! The chat has amnesia! They don't know what game this is? :O
00,10mann up is got some real specal eds tonight
/me fails at being funny
XAX: But in Gears of War, soldiers don't even need shock paddles or any fancy medical equipment. :3
Sumica: Pardon?
AdamTheDuck: lol.
Sumica oh?
AdamTheDuck, they die like real men do.
00,10had a soldier with a rocket jumper
LOL.
XAX: They simply yell at downed soldiers to get the fuck back into battle, like real men :D
00,10and a piro that spent all his time bitching about no one geting money as he stood in the back with a flare gun
00,10on a piro wave
wut.
Do that twice in Gears and they still die.
LOL
AdamTheDuck: "I DONT CARE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR BODY HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH LEAD. GET BACK IN THERE SOLDIER."
My point exactly :D
its not really replaced though
its added
^^
true.
i think tonight i shall order KFC
Mmm Chicken
Chrysalis: get dat double down burger
im gonna go for the wicked zinger probably
That works tooZ
too.*
apparently its nice and hot
Dat awkward silence
i think people got the wrong meaning of hot
Maybe
im gonna see how much bandwidth TF2 uses
maybe i can get some games in
this game needs about 20% more steampunk
steampunk?
GoI?
Wht are we watching?
Metronome: Guns of Icarus
thx
looks kinda boring to me
An indie steampunk airship battle simulator Metronome
Is it multiplayer?
Chrysalis: Looks more like this: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockPunk, to me
Eeyup
OMGKFGJSEGJSETHSREH
Best Game everrrrrrrrrrr
Lol nerdgasm :D
00,02Chrysalis, usualy no more than 50kbits.s
00,02Metronome, eyup
00,02need a bit of polish
00,02but damn
00,02i'm amazed that no ones made this before
Phase4: Ikr
00,02seems like theres no one online
00,02they're gona have trouble getting players
00,02unless there are more pre-orders than i thought
00,02which would be awesome :3
I might get a 4 pack later this month :3
it is still beta. a lot of people wont even touch a beta of an indie game
Don't know who to give the other 3 copies to though :D
00,02RoboGerbil, closed beta
Phase4 where you queued for?
00,02exited the game
o_O
lol queued to exit?
00,02Chrysalis, theres no one in lobby
00,02like a total of 15 people playing globally right now
fair enoug
Phase4 theres 40 in the water one
and 10 in dunes
00,02wait, what?
00,02mine had completely different numbers
well thats a good sign
so howd you get into closed beta?
00,02the tital music is reall nice
00,02RoboGerbil, by getting keys
00,02i dont have any
hax
o wells guess im gonna go slay some zombies in l4d2

00,02Chrysalis, queued in angelic raiders
00,02though i'd rather not be captin
same really
00,02wish Wrek was playing
they NEED to put AI captains in this game
00,02ai captins would suck
00,02what they need is more players
yeah, but at least we could play with the current low player count
playing with poor AI is better than sitting waiting
Holla everypony! :)

Lil_B: Lolwut :D
08,01heh
FUUUUCK
:[
Guns of Icarus....really?
yeah, the grammar is kinda off XD
:L
wrong gender, it’s „Ein Kuchen“
Son of a....
or did you mean kitchen?
I HATE this game.
Mane 6 Fighting is magic is better
Please VioletLynnScraton , everyone has their preferences
Is this hl3
Clutching is forbidden. :(
AdamTheDuck: more like opinions...but ok
wow i havnt been on bronystate for a month......feels good to be back :$
Same difference
.....GRRRR.... The FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
Welcome back sammiver
did i hear...
OPINIONS?
what is on stream
Buytoast: Nope.
who's the fucker thinking differntly
Hat: Guns of Icarus
what game is this?
Thanks Duckty
Who is streaming anyways?
sammiver: Guns of Icarus
VioletLynnScraton: Phase is.
Phase4 is streaming
ok
I'm like the answer man :3
AdamTheDuck: true.
/me gives AdamTheDuck a hat that says "answer guy" on it.
FUUUU- :{
AdamTheDuck answer man is best pony
;[
:[
Yay another hat to add to the collection :3
lol
sammiver: More like Vinyl Scratch..
Still trying to find a bowler hat that isn't valued at $200
Good luck with that. =P
Phase, Y U NO STREAM PONIES
Fuck my life.
+Phase4 is best streamer
MASF123: no thank you :3
what is the point of this game?
AdamTheDuck: Have you tried ebay?
Gold_Demona: Yeah but they're all really cheap quality
ah
If i were to call Phase4 on skype, he'd probably deny it.
:L
I got killed by I Ilovefatasses22
if only Mane 6 MLP: Fighting is Magic was multiplayer....
I would K.O. everyone with mah trusty Applejack. :D
VioletLynnScraton ... it is, they already showed on Stage VS matches
yeah it should be an indie game for xbox
MASF123: Yes. I shall send that to Microsoft.
You realy should
I might if i can get their phone #
But... it's a fan game...
use their contacts on xbox.com
Alright, i will l83r
so what they can profit if they buy the license
.....?
That's like selling a fanfiction, isn't it?
and bronies will buy it regardless so why not they will get more money back.
You can sell fanfiction if you want to.
No you can't
are you bloody insane?
Not without getting sued
even MURIKA would sue your ass to the ground for that
Yeah, but there's a thing called copyright law?
That's why you buy the license like I said.
You can't sell something that's made with somebody else's property.
Read my posts plz
Like it's that easy to buy a license
it is
I'll be right back.
ok
fuuuuuu-
Goddamn it son of a bitch!
08,01so not many people know this
08,01but i have... i dunno, a fear, an extreme distaste, of bins
Like waste bins?
08,01yes
O_o
08,01the thought of touching one fills me with abject terror
o.o
...germaphobe?
08,01my mother has no such qualms, and i was arguing with her over whether the bacon was, in fact, ham
08,01so she opened the bin, and dug through it to find the packet
08,01i nearly screamed
08,01i freaked the fuck out
what was in the packet?
08,01i demanded she wash her hands 3 times
Oh, you mean touching the CONTENTS of the bin
08,01Gold_Demona: contents or actual bin
08,01anything to do with bins
Oh... hm
Recycle bins on the computer scare him too.
08,01she was refusing to wash them the third time, and i nearly broke down in tears; that's how upsetting it was to me
08,01my brain is weird sometimes
...that's kind of sad. I guess.
I can understand not wanting to touch the stuff in the trashcan. That stuff's gross.
ohai Mark!
ohai
08,01Gold_Demona: well, yeah, but it's not just like "eew, gross", it actually freaks me the fuck out
08,01i told this to my best friend in edinburgh; when i made bad puns or horrific jokes, she'd chase me around her flat with a broom she'd dipped in the bin
I can't say that's the weirdest phobia I've ever heard, but it's right up there.
i have many fears...some I don't even remember what they are.
00,10what's wrong with the bin folder, most my steam stuff is in there.
who is streaming still?
That is cruel of her sammiver :/
oops wrong tab again :D
08,01AdamTheDuck: well, she knew not to actually touch me with it, or corner me; it was all in good fun
I have an irrational fear of personally interacting with people I don't know.
08,01i'm sort of like that about plants too
Ah, the way you made it out it sounded like she was being mean :3
08,01but not to the same level
i have a fear of slender
;__;
plants aren't much of a threat to humans. Some can be poisenous
It's really stupid, cuz I have a hard time even making phone calls to get important things done.
08,01MASF123: i just find them tres creepy
I have a phobie of some kinds of raugh surfaces, like Cartboard Boxes
They ok
I can't touch them without my hair thanding streight up
Lil_B: Bet you hate sandpaper then. =P
08,01MASF123: i don't think so. the only fear i have that i can ascribe to a past trauma is my fear of lifts
08,01i don't have many fears, but the ones i do have are rather strane
is it still +phase4 streaming this?
08,01*strange
sammiver: Eeyup
Hi all
Hello LadyFluxum
What game is this?
Sandpaper is fine actually, I don't know what it is -.- Cardboard Boxes and erm... whats the english word
could be something you can't remember
08,01basically, when i was 5, i was trapped in a lift in india. all the walls, the ceiling, and the floor of the lift were mirrors. i was trapped in The Box of Truth for about 5 minutes, but it felt like hours. From then on, I've not been able to travel in lifts (except glass ones)
a type of really cheap wall...
Oh, like drywall?
08,01Lil_B: plasterboard?
i love the sound it makes every time someone sends a messege to you on bronystate :)
I getcha, Lil_B. It's that particular texture
08,01sammiver: <3
08,01MASF123: escalators are fine; lift is the british word for elevator
sammiver: How ya doing, bro?
Gold_Demona yeah, it's really just some strange ones
oh...
ok. so lift you ment elevator?
ladyfluxum im doing fine, bro
08,01Lil_B: i'm absolutely fine in those
sammiver: Massive torrents and thunderstorm here atm :/
Hello Bronystate! :)
/me hugs MadSurge
Hi MadSurge
/me hugs MadSurge
ladyfluxum :( where do you live? in sweden right now the weather is great
bins...why do you fear them?
/me 08,01hugs MadSurge
sammiver: I'm swedish aswell
Hello MadSurge
We're discussing fears? I was terrified of lizards when I was little :D
and LadyFluxum this is Guns of Icarus
08,01MASF123: i think i'm just afraid of germs in general, but it doesn't really affect me apart from the bins thing
Was afk :3
it's normal.
08,01MASF123: *you're
Fears? Well, that would be jellyfish
08,01AdamTheDuck: it's not being a grammar nazi, it's being an educator.
hello
ladyfluxum :O awsome atleast in stockholm the weather is great but im not sure because i cant look out of my window
08,01sammiver: the weather in scotland is great too
08,01AdamTheDuck: i'm light as a feather.
well, I have fears of Hights too XD If I'm more than 23 steps on a ledder or bending over a railing without having my hands on something to hold me I'm close to becoming uncouncous
2 Steps*
Screw jellyfish
I remember Monk suffers from many phopia and fears. It's a funny show though.
I'm now scared of twilight.
phobia
MASF123: Ah Monk, is that the show that runs for about 2 minutes about a raging white dog?
noooo......
MASF123: Monk also has OCD, so that doesn't help any of his fears any. :P
MASF123: Damn... :P
Monk is a great detective.
Jellyfish used to be normal fish, but when the other fishes saw them they laughed at them and said "You Jelly?" because they couldn't swim
08,01(according to wikipedia :P)
Oh
Still freak me out
wikipedia
/me gives out hugs
But their cullular makeup is more of a hybrid of plant and animal
/me hugs Chrysalis back
08,01LadyFluxum: it blew my mind when i foudn out that virii are not actually alive
some Jellyfish even have developed some early stages of Eyes
Oh god....
yes god
Lil_B: Like Tentacruel?
who dumped a gallon of mountain dew into the ocean?!
WOW i just took off my headphones and its a thunder storm outside and i thought the weather was great :'(
sammiver: told ya
Lil_B: Or maybe a metroid?
Gold_Demona: Nah, metroids doesn't develop eyes untill the gamma stage
LadyFluxum: Oh yeah, I forgot. :P
i still dont see the point with this game
Maybe jellyfish are getting into the gamma stage. :O
Gold_Demona: at zeta stage tey got 8 eyes ^^
I think it looks fun
Who dumped Mountain Dew into the ocean?!
MadSurge: Does that mean they're gonna eat our brains?
sammiver, you're part of the crew of an airship teaming up with the crew of another airship against two other airships.
Gold_Demona: no, but they'll gladly eat our cells
Who wants.... a kinda creepy music video countaining ponies>

00,02derp
00,02MaxTheBrony, dont think so
00,02unless you get it with the pre-order
Isn't the essentially "buying into the beta" though?
00,02i hope the game gets a bit of polish before its released
It seems like a fun concept
and I'm back... I had to show my mother how to copy pictures onto an USB_Stick and the mean of a "Double Click" ...
Ooh Phase4 , can I creep bronystate with my song? No video though, just music.
i have been away from the computer for 10 minutes....have i missed anything?

HEY, im a khajiit, BUG OFF!!!!

killerpony7733: Aww, dude.
How was Oblivion, compared to Skyrim?
Phase4 Ikr?
but i think robbaz lives in a city in the north of sweden or something like that and i live in stockholm
So, how much fun did I miss during the GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0 show last night?
Oblivion! you sicken me.....
sammiver where in stockholm?
Ahh Oblivion. I once spent four days trying to get all the mods to work before I gave up.
in a place called Enskede
Fisheh_Fish: soso. Mostly talked about favorite games, GamesRadar top 100 games, MMOs, and their fundraiser for them to go to Bronycon Fan Fair
ah

Picard.
DUDE IN A DARK ROOM
Okay flutter_spin . Still wish I could have been there for it :(

After we wach Phase spend an hour making his face :3

I tried Oblivion for 5 hours, but couldn't get much into it. (I was borrowing it)
Slender = most overrated game ever
Phase4: no mods?
Phase4 You can get 100 immunity to disease if you get a ring that increases that
sammiver: Slender is a "cat jumping on a piano" simulator :D
Phase4 Meaning you got no way to get poisoned or diseased
00,02Nyst, no mods
OH MAH GAWD JUST PLAI SLENDER
00,02VioletLynnScraton, NO :<
Wow...that should be something then.

Phase4 Oh that too. that's even one of the better traits
Its scar and i love it

11PM
flutter_spin: I have the same problem with Skyrim and the four Assassin's Creed games
00,02Dark_Horst, 23:00
Gold_Demona: informative/humorous LPs are still the best
sammiver: you only see the back of the head though.
00,0211 PM
MadSurge: True dat
lol. Ditto Phase4 . After the 5th crash/bug I gave up. Barely got out of the first place.
Phase4: where are yu?
Nyst Umm tbh i wen't away from what it asks to you try out and wen't with the main traits going for repair weapons heavy heavy armor or light armor idunno. I just remember going for weapon skill and several other related things
00,02Dark_Horst, australia
Odd, My lightIRC flash isnt working :(
oh boy
00,02we got many magicka players in here?
Let our journey to meet the 7 voice actors begin!
nyst but the back of the head is ugly too
poor widdle golakka
I play it sometimes Phase4
00,02golakka, :(
Nyst Repair or smithing as a major skill is very very useful
name your
00,02if we get three magicka players we can play that
oops
Alright
Count me in Phase4
Ive not hit people with ARSE mines in ages :D
killerpony7733: See I thought stealth or lockpicking were better. But then I like playing as a sneaky character.
Magicka? Now why does that sound familiar
Repair will allow you to build Weapon Repair kits... wait...
+phase4 name your character Willie wonka!
Magicka is a friend killing simulator.
Nyst Oh sure lockpicking as a major skill is a big yes
morrowind>oblivion
So that should be one of the major skills
oblivion however is an amazing game
+phase4 or John de lancie
00,02how does one close oblivion
Alt F4
00,02there we go
Alt F4 doesn't work for oblivion
00,02golakka, didnt work
Ctrl Q
You need a mod to use alt F4
how could someone make the most useless character? pick athletics, acrobatics, illusion as major skills?
00,02AdamTheDuck, wat
yo ho
wut?
Phase4: That's the Bethesda you know and love.
AVAST ME HEARTIES :D
IM on steam justnow if you want to get a magica group going
+phase4 is and always will be the best pony
Phase4: I should rephrase that to: You need a mod to use the alt F4 shortcut in Oblivion.
Applejack is my waifu
I'm loading my Magicka
00,02alt+f4 is handled by windows
Hmm, according to steam
i dont have internet
00,02you need code to stop it closing a window
00,02its opt-out, not opt-in
MAGICKA
No really. I don't know this game.
Phase4, whats your steam?
Still, couldn't the devs make the game so it closes to desktop when alt+F4 is held ingame?
lol, dat password

And its crashed!
lets talk mlp
00,02golakka, verify the integrity, we;ll try let you join at the next checkpoint
kk
fluttermac That would get boring quick in most cases. We generally talk about things we like etc and what now
fluttermac: pinkie pie is best pony
But suit yourself
ALL DEM GAMES SHOUT OUTS :D
i like fluttershy
sammiver: I agree
MadSurge: IKR
steam is such a useless program
:| Vista's being a jerk - wont load up ES:Oblivion...or much of anything else for that matter
your punishment must be more severe +phase4
fluttermac: /) *yay*
fluttermac: me too! What about your least favorite pony?
I hate to say this. Rainbow Dash is my least favorite.
:(
fluttermac: fluttershy and rarity keep fighting for the "second favorite" on my list. :3
200 hours to validate magica
hmmm uh i dont like pinkie
Argh! I gotta restart..*grumbles*
Well, if we're only talking about the mane six, Twilight's my least favorite.
flutter_spin: me too actually
Ok, Im just running the IRC now, no stream
hopefully it will be faster
I like each of the mane six, all for different reasons
Gold_Demona: 5th favorite
08,01i just bought the dark grey hoodie version of this: http://www.redbubble.com/people/pixel-pie-pro/works/7830340-i-can-count-to-muffin-mlp-fim
Fluttershy, Twilight, and Pinkie Pie match my personality. Rarity is unique, but more complex (which makes her interesting). Applejack intimidates me, but she can handle herself. I just don't like competition, which is why Rainbow Dash is there.
my little sis is BUGGING ME
I just saw the antagonist poster, and laughed so hard at Silverspoon and Diamond Tiara
MadSurge: Rainbowdash is 5th on my list
"Det va nu danskt"?
Gold_Demona: Pinkie is your fav, right?
MadSurge: Yesh
Gold_Demona: /)
I <3 LUNA
She used to be sixth favorite, but she bounced her way up as the series progressed. =P
Pinkie went from bottom to near top to me aswell
No. Fluttershy is my favorite. Twilight is best. Pinkie Pie is just fun lovin'
but, I love the bottom pony too
(\ MadSurge
is anyone here a clopper?
<.<
Gold_Demona: similar with Rarity, she was least favorite but now she's 4th :D
i miss derpy
Vivix: Me too. I love all of the mane 6. I just love some more than others
yeah
sammiver: we don't need to know that thanks :D
what're we watching
chat is PG rated, keep it that way
"Magicka"
MadSurge: Rarity started out in the middle for me, now she fights with Fluttershy for the Number 2 slot. =P
/me glomps Vivix tightly
/me bites Jmo's ear
Daaaaaaaaat Vivix.
Hiiii
I think my top three is Fluttershy Rarity and Pinkie
are they speaking a twist of civilation language and simese?
Actually, I'm incredibly shy when meeting up with people.
Vivix: Me too, but it's Pinkie first.
Gold_Demona: realized I love her drama queen routines :D
*cilization
it looks like noone here is a clopper.........good
hah
http://www.redbubble.com/people/scrittah/works/7620933-stealthy-pink-e-pi-shirt
Well atleast Pinkie is on that list.
this ones quite clever
Well time for me to hit the hay, night everyone. :)
/me got up 5 minutes ago
sammiver: there might be, but we're not allowed to talk about it
pro or con, don't talk about it
MadSurge: Rarity won me over completely with her whining scene.
The whining scene was one of the first things I saw on youtube, that made me just--have to see the show
im in canada
Chrysalis: I want that shirt. :O
dat kandarihu
lol
Gold_Demona: I was giggling so much at the "AHM SO PATHEHEHEHETEEC" scene :D
hehe
I still don't know what we're watching
Rarity is adoreable
ok Phase4, magica validated, gonna try again
whoa
MadSurge: Yes, I loved that scene. XD
iam wathcing this day aria literil
00,02K
MadSurge: "Do ponies wallow in pity? Oh, listen to me! I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in!!!"
It is like Diablo
this needs to be a t-shirt http://ih1.redbubble.net/image.12149818.6899/pp,375x360.jpg
whats he playing an why is purple tentacle in it?
"Magicka"
I guess the tentacle outfit is a fun reference
Gold_Demona: Oh Tabitha :D
so, I ask about three times, and Dark_Horst asks once...
bah whatever
haha
MadSurge: She's brilliant
Wow
cowvarkian: they're playing Magicka
I know
I heard
DED
cowvarkian: they tend t sleep at times
cowvarkian: I've been answering the question too many times. I've been trying to get back to my fic
<.< why are guns in magicka
They're magic guns! :D
cowvarkian, Vietnam
Gold_Demona: the best kind of guns
obviously
So, I've had three hours of sleep today, and I'm going back to school tommorow
wow. There are a LOT put into this game
It's also one of the buggiest games I've ever played
Banana?
LOL
I didn't think they would put it in the pause screen. I thought the guy was kidding
Ouch
Chrysalis: the second one
whats with the teletubby
Made it! Yay~
lol. Is there a way to turn off friendly fire?
noo
why would you want to
it makes the game extra hard
08,01Chrysalis: the latter would suit you better
aw ok. and more fun?
yeaa
3-0
and then they instantly die
like that,hehehe
yeah im getting that one
LOL
KA-BEEEWWWWWWM
wooow

Dammit Vista! Y U Gotta Make Me RAGE? :| all these stupid confirmation questions - Are you sure you want to install? Do you want to make this a trusted program?
euch, so much RD material
How about we do it tomorrow night, Phase4?
streamception
00,02l
00,02k'
Aww, I almost only catch the end of your streams Phase
damn timezones
I woke up early today. I never do either.
I downloaded the MGS HDC on my 360...
dammit
i just got magica working Phase4
argh
00,02XD
/me 00,02hugs golakka
in the middle of the night
Chrysalis: should i get final fantasy 8?
YES!
whilst watching hell on wheels
Bronysith a million times yes
Chrysalis: i shall buy it later on the PSN
Install screen just loaded an ad - download Oblivion on your mobile phone....O_o Really? I cant fight baddies on a 2 inch 2 bit screen :|
dat old ass ad
eww psn
Chrysalis: is the story pretty good to 8?
Bronysith its one of the earlier FF's
Personally I thought 8 was boring.
the story rivals or beats just about anything ever made
Not NEARLY as boring as 12, but pretty boring.
I thouht you had 8?
Is it one of the 800 hour long ones?
cowvarkian not 800, but im a good 20hours in
Or am I thinking of some other game
and only on the 2nd of 4 disks
Is it one of the games that's 60% cutscene?
if 8 was the one I played, it didn't have that many cutscenes
nope
Ok
but- it wasn't my kinda game
but the cutscenes are georgious
is the stream on?
no
http://youtu.be/-6b6HYHcF0A
As far as FF's, I liked 6, 7, 9, and 10 the most.
In that order
though 6 and 7 are interchangeable
Gold_Demona dont drop F bombs like that
Gold_Demona: noone likes 8 :D
which one was the 8? The one wiht the train?
back :)
the stream doesnt work for me....
its down
Welkommen
:)
Vivix: 8 was the one where the guy's sword was also a gun
hmm
Gold_Demona: which is BAD ASS
That might have been the one I was told to play-
one of the first cutscenes is eh a ballroom dance?
Bronysith: I will not argue that. Gunblade is awesome
Gold_Demona: until lightingin in ff13 makes it lame
Doesn't make up for boring story and characters though.
gunblade is ridicilous
hehe
*spelling
most ff weapons are ridiculous, but- you don't see them very often?
thats it
Vivix: there is a train on 8, but you practically just fight a boss on it
I like the ridiculous weapons in FF mostly because they're unique
And only the characters in the game can wield them. XD
Hm, MadSurge it miight- be the one I played, I can't remember. Friend lent it to me on PS2 I think
Like Sephiroth's katana. Seriously. That thing's ridiculously long.
final fantasy 8 is the fastest selling final fantasy?
WOW
Vivix: if it was 3d then yes it was 8
fuck it
yeah it was like odd 3D
im buying this game for my colleciton
Vivix: There are trains in several FF games. 8's primary mode of transportation was... a city.
Computer keeps freezing up because Vista keeps rotating my windows around in different orders when it sole purpose should be intalling a game :|
What should I have played to get into the story?
a flying city that was slow as molasses
Vivix: the other with a train dungeon was 6, but that was 2D
the live stream doesnt work for me....
7 started with a train.
it might have just been a short train sequence-
sammiver: there's no stream right now
it was not in the beginning--I think...
the beginnign was like in a --place and you went dancing
:[ Window Roulette over here :|
/me master of memory
Anyone playing on Desolation on Gw2 :P?
In 8, I remember Selphie going nuts "I LOVE TRAINS!!!!"
MadSurge: what happened to the stream?
Gold_Demona: yees, I think I remember that
Vivix: That was 8
Phase4|2 went away
sammiver: Phase4 just stopped streaming
Okay, then I've played 8 and tiny tiny tiny bit of 6 when I was a kid
As far as story, I think 6 and 7 had better-developed stories.
sammiver: now to wait for the next mod up to streaming...
00,02?
hn, cause yeah people seem to love FF, but I wasn't too fond of the battle system, and didn't get the story back then
but, retrying is fun
sammiver: Now you can post youtube links btw
MadSurge: ok i went away from the computer for 10 minutes and when i came back it was like this
MadSurge: how do you post links?
I remember ff8's battle system being annoying.
Chrysalis: so tell me what makes ff8 so good?
If it doesnt install right this time - Fallout - if that crashes - Minecraft - and if that crashes I might as well call it a day because I'll be too ticked off to bother any further
Mostly because I sucked at doing those "timed trigger attack" things
Gold_Demona: then you wouldnt like legend of dragoon
sammiver: just post it on the dialogue bar o__o
Gold_Demona: lots of that in the game, mostly combos in fact
Cypresswolf: ;__; crashing and annoying windows functions are the worst
ok
Bronysith: Combos? Like the kind in Chrono Trigger/Cross?
Gold_Demona: no i mean timed button presses in turn based
Ew
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5jKuYOotsA
Uah
I bought W7 after using Xp for years- skipped Vista because of friends reviews
Bronysith: Yeah, that stuff's annoying. If you're gonna make button combo things, then make it a real-time adventure game thing, like Kingdom Hearts was.
Gold_Demona: but that was the appeal to legend of dragoon, along with an awesome story and characters
Bronysith: If the story and characters are good enough, I can usually overlook annoying gameplay
I have window 7 - for about 2 years now - every attempt to install it has ended up with Vista stopping the entire installation because it found (or made up) an error :|
whaaaat-
That's terrible-
/me tackles Vivix
No, that is.
I bought a new HDD when I bought W7, cause I broke my old one
08,01heh, still getting posts about BUCK:
08,01http://www.fobequestria.com/2012/08/mission-005-buck-debrief-part-1-photo.html
/me cries abuse, shouts for help
WTF kind of program cant install an upgrade made for it?
08,01soem AMAZING photos there
Gold_Demona: well i didnt really give 8 a fair chance, because i did just finish 7 which is a hard act to follow in a game
Bronysith: For example Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance has awesome characters and story, but I HATE the battle system.
Bronysith: True.
Cypresswolf: you bought upgrade or full W7?
Bronysith: I played 8 all the way to the final dungeon and couldn't finish it.
Gold_Demona: so ill give it a fair shot to it. cause i do love a GOOD jrpg
Gold_Demona: and most final fantasies are
Gold_Demona: 6 7 and 10 were good
Bronysith: The older ones anyway
Gold_Demona: not this bullshit 13 bullshit
BULLSHIT FINAL FANTASY GAME
Bronysith: I didn't even bother with 13 cuz 12 was so horribly boring.
Its Windows 7 home premium, same type as my Vista os -
Gold_Demona: i quit 13 in 30 minutes
00,02"Some great cosplays on display at BUCK 2012. Here's one of TheLivingTombstone."
I lost faith in their ability to tell a good story
Gold_Demona: not kidding
They're graphics are gorgeous but that doesn't excuse crappy storytelling
Cypresswolf: okay, well if its the full and not vistaupgrade, you could backup what you want to save into USB disk, format the computer, and do a clean install. Shouuld-work. but if it doesn't- yeah
Gold_Demona: lets be honest now
Gold_Demona: most people are impressed by graphics to be the better game nowadays
AKA FALSE GAMERS
:) I've pretty much destroyed the outer casing to Rage Quitting - throwing the thing across the room just about everytime 7's installation was cancelled and restarted
Didn't know that you could lay golden eggs Phase4.
Cypresswolf: hehe, sounds like my old computer
00,02o_O
Oy all, real quick: is there an official time BronyState goes by? GMT/UTC? Eastern?
Bronysith: My honest opinion. Graphics don't make the game, but they are nice to have.
the discs are fine though :)
08,01Phase4: <3
Gold_Demona: yes, but not that important
Bronysith: Just because a game is super pretty doesn't make it a good game
08,01Bronysith: <3 too
Gold_Demona: nope, but most gamers nowadays whom are impressed by skyrim cause of the graphics are false gamers
That being said, retro isn't for everyone. I couldn't play Morrowind until I installed MGE Xe
worst part -I cant take it back - too damaged :D
Hehe
I wouldn't call them false gamers. They're just easily impressed
I think one of my fav RPGs is the original Fallout
But honestly, a full format should work, but you might loose all your stuff if the backup goes wrong
Gold_Demona: false gamers
wow, by that number of people on Bronystate who wanna go to Buck next year I need to bring along a big Cardboard with "Bronystate" written on it to find everyone :)
Bronysith: judgemental much?
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
Gold_Demona: easily impressed=false gamers
;__;
:3
I havent attempted to reinstall it for 7 months now - I know the end result all too well
:(
Gold_Demona: sorry, gaming is my passion since i was a little kid
Bronysith: Hey hey hey. I'm easily impressed.
I don't believe false gamers exist, but- I know theres a flux of casual and mainstream gamers
08,01Chrysalis: you get so much <3 that it goes without saying
CASUALS!!!!!!
and I don't mind
Dan VS Casual gamers
more money for the companies is good for me
00,02Lets settle this argument: Graphics are not everything, nor are they meeningless
00,02Bronysith, SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
Phase4: ikr
:) Oblivion is done installing - time to saciate my rage :)
Phase4: Exactly
Cypresswolf: beat those mudcrabs!
08,01Bronysith: i mostly play games for the graphic
08,01s
Beat those Vivixs!
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
08,01heh
08,01that's ironic, because i don't like computer games, really
08,01Chrysalis: you get so much <3 that it goes without saying
/me cries. "Jmo, you're so mean"
08,01whoops
I usually don't judge a game by it's graphics, but it's definitely a bonus if a good game si also pretty.
08,01i just find them kinda boring, mostly
I love you too Vivix.
<3
08,01Phase4: on IPv6?
Gold_Demona: that's how I tend to think
so +phase4 stopped streaming but he is still here?
Atm, my obsession is next gen physics
00,02i get 2^72 static addresses + 2^64 dynamic for the ppp session
00,02sammiver, yes
Herbal Essence ad
08,01Vivix: generational physics?
08,01Vivix: like particle physics?
08,01Bronysith: i'm the antithesis of a gamer
08,01oh
... these Remix War Requirements are bullshit... why do I have to use Box.com or Minus.com as upload sites and not Mediafire?
08,01i've coded physics simulations before
Hi bronystate
00,02ma prefix is 2001:44b8:4196:e800::
Fluid Dymanics intregs me and pisses me off at the same time
hehe
00,02there are many like it, but this one is mine
hi FillyFlam
I am in love with Soft body physics destruction, like that Cryengine 3 car demo video
X3
My true coding love
08,01Dumori: i love fluid dynamics! especially because one can apply fluidic concepts to traffic!
Hi FillyFlam
Traficc control simulation office, GO!
is the demo secen way fo magic insanely small programs via generating the rest of the program vis a seed...
yeah, I think all the traffic planners go by fluid simulation now
08,01my favourite branch of physics is particle physics
It just annoys me cos some times it's "guess" work more than pure math
particle pysics is ok
08,01but i also have a soft spot for macro electromagnetics
erm... is someone here good with photoshop or another Programm to edit a picture?
08,01which kinda ties in with particle physics in the sense of accelerator design
electromagnetisim is awesome
when I was 13 I built a guass gun
and I did all the math
08,01Dumori is my new favourite princess
well most of the math
and maybe I was 14
but still
Good morning
00,02you guys and your greater understanding of math than me
all these nice childhoots ... All I got to do was go to the doctore, play PC and meet the (way too big) family :(
the guy who helped me with the math whent on to get a scolarship at cambrige after getting 100% on is A levels
Because the stream buffer is up, I'm marveling at Phase4's Firefox, safari and opera and IE icons
08,01i built a tesla coil when i was 18 and did most of the math; but at this point i was studying physics as a degree, so it's not as impressive :P
00,02Vivix, chrome should be on there too
I love i
IDKY but i is fun
Hehehe, oh yes there it is
Testing stuff with them?
00,02every now and again
08,01Dumori: that's awesome
more or less
+phase4 can i get your autograph?
Sation fuck you I got a U in A2
00,02i want to build stuff like that but i has no money
math
00,02sammiver, over the internet?
I has spoiler Nows
+phase4 yes
I messed up my 18th year SO hard
I actually have a C or D in compsci
cos I did no corsework for 2 years
I dropped out and went to a no-degree music school
08,01Dumori: you're still my favourite princess <3
/me unemployed
/me glomps Vivix
Tbh I just tossed off at college
I got a B in math though
like the exam
/me hugs Jmo
20% attedence in pysics almost kicked out of the place for that
got 98% on the final
!
+phase4 or i can go to your house and get it where do you live?
LOl
08,01i'm going to be studying acoustics and music technology for my Masters degree
08,01it's gonna be AMAZING
00,02sammiver, depends on how good a swimmer you are :P
The end of community college, the music school, me and my friends went to maybe--one class a week. and since it was project we got no absence
00,02gota swim all the way to aus
all self taught stuff
Nice
08,01well, either that or particle physics
Though to day I gave up on music as a hobby, cos I cba with it
i can swim very good....and by that i mean im just going to take a boat
08,01i've not decided yet
TRIVIA TIME BITCHES: what is the first animated movie ever?
dunno
08,01Bronysith: your mum and a big black dude
Rotoscope horse animation test?
^
your jelly? Can I be beanut Butter?
dat beanut butter o.o
peanut butter*
Hi all :P
I kinda want to go back to school, and work my way into performing arts college
but I need a job, so that might be a bad idea
Bronysith define film in that question please.
How are you everypony?
Dumori: full length movie
I good, you good?
humm IDK then
I am good
well full lenght movie would be what..1940s?
Dumori: snow white nad the seven dwarves
most animations were preshow things for cinemas, not full length
I doubt it sir
Bronysith: Snow White and the Seven Dwarves?
+phase4 DO YOU LIVE IN AUSTRALIA I LOVE THAT PLACE BUT I LIVE IN but i live in sweden which is the other side of the earth :'( but i will still get your autograph
Gold_Demona: yup
Dang it I type too slow
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ap%C3%B3stol
Gold_Demona: Indeed you type slow
Snow white was maybe the first full length, but it was far from the first animated film or show
I can dispence several messages in the matter of a minute

Vivix it's not even the first
Gimme my box!
first in techicolour though
Gold_Demona: at least you don't make typos :D
Dumori: mmm, was Steamboat Willy full length? (80+min)
MadSurge: I try not to anyway. I don't always succeed. :P
that's the first with synced sound
Gold_Demona: same
So first might have been..Fleischer animation. If any of those were over 30 minutes
+phase4 when are you going to stream again?
Education is important
00,02sammiver, maybe tomorow
But Phase4, it is tomorrow. :P
Vivix: I doubt any of those older cartoons even go UP to 30 minutes
Gold_Demona: true..now I'm curious as to what IS the first full length, though
morning everypony
08,01ho-ly-shit
I found out that The Story of the Kelly Gang was the first (in 1906)
Gold_Demona: yeah, like..audience warmup
08,01you know Malcolm MacDowell?
ya?
+phase4 ok......but i still want your autograph....send it as a messege please i will pay you with muffins
Kelly Gang was full length?
08,01the guy who played Soren in Star Trek: Generations
08,01and the evil guy in Tank Girl
ja
go on
08,01and Linderman in Heroes
+phase4 MUFFINS
08,01he's the same guy who played the main character, Alex, in A Clockwork Orange
08,01mind = blown
Aah-
X3
how Horrorshow
I went to see that movie with friends, really excited cause Al Jean said it was amazing. I left half way through
FYI that's why I'm called Alex due to A Clockwork Orange
it was 70 min long
Vivix you wern't a fan of a bit of ultraviolence?
Pearly: I think that's full length, now I kinda want to see it
TheMaster: the violence wasn't that bad, it just felt pointless to me, so we left early
Vivix: read the book
To each their own
it's better imho
Me too now
Hmm, well maybe I'll read it if I find it
My favourite trad.animation film is Bambi- never really seen enough before that era of style to know much about it
Bambi I've never fully seen
I saw it properly this year, after seeing it as a kid
IIRC it freake dme the fuck out as a kinder
and it was..so good
Bambi seen it as a kid.
but I'm talking toddler
and the documentary abou the making of it? oh my god
yeah, I didn't remember anything of it from seeing it as kid
What is blue and fluffy?
I laughed at the birds going crazy and later getting shot part. I was a fucked up kid.
08,01MASF123: yup
hehe
most kids are
The kelly Gang is on ebay but in PAL

Eli yeah... good thing I have both Soundtracks XD
what other color should I have in my hair? http://i48.tinypic.com/2m5xugl.jpg
Sazh's theme is so chill :)
i liek Vladimir Lenin
Pearly: shame on you
^
Pearly: it is just a yellow pinkie pie with wings
no me gusta Joseph Stalin
Bronysith Dat alicorn OC
Pearly: so uncreative man
Bronysith: and a horn...
Pearly i liek it
:3
LAME OC IS LAME
well my name is Pearly Pie
>__>
Chill Bronysith
Pearly: and you make it related to pinkie pie
DOUBLE SHAME ON YOU
I would have a contrast in the hair completely
Bronysith thats not very nice
Hey guys. Even if it's uncreative, we sjouldn't be dicks to Pearly.
*shouldn't*
/me nomths Vivix
^^
well the colors, not what it lookslike
AJIsAwesome, urge to complain....wising
/me agrees with AJIcAwesome
rising**
guys don't be so awful about it... but there ARE more than enough over the top OCs out there...
Dat Ic o.o
Pearly: I'd try to find a contrasting colour for mane, and just have a related shade as second mane
Pearly: either make it a unicorn or pegasus
Pearly: I like it. It could use some originality, but I like it.
I asked what other color should the third color be for my hair
Pearly: not a stupid alicorn. TEHRE ARE ONLY 3 ALICORNS
lol typo
USSR > Western hemisphere
2 alcirons Bronysith, and several winged pegasi in the royal family
Pearly: Try not to focus on making it an Alicorn.
winged unicorns*
Vivix: whatever
a megasus with nor horn?
Vivix: So Cadence isn't an alicorn?
Vivix: winged pegasi?
pegasus*
For some reason bronies hate alicorns that arn't Canon... cus bronies are wierd
weell, she's halfblooded or something
Vivix: WTF
Winged unicorn*
Bronysith: i wouldn't say that. there can be more alicorns, but if you create an alicorn, do it in a possible context
Vivix: I THOUGHT ALL PEGASI HAD WINGS?!
She ages at rate of Twilight, and marries a mortal. I don't think shes full blooded
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW578GeFTw4
Bronysith: it's a typo, chill
AJIsAwesome, I am going to redraw, here is the drawing I did
My celestia bronies. My dad took me for a long walk
http://i50.tinypic.com/2yxopk2.jpg I see that is too ywllow and gold
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN3AOyNVFrU C:
if i see another person make an alicorn or winged unicorn and they are just rip offs of the mane six i am going to bust a nut
I would do a more active contrast for her mane, make her less yellow
Pearly: It's nice. If you're going to give her a personality, don't make her a Mary Sue.
alicorn+mary sue
God no
haha its just a description I got from a quiz
I feel sweaty and exhausted
my OC's are a Cervine mix and a Goatalope hybrid- I need a pony
fucking alicorn ocs
Mine's just a pegasus.
AJIsAwesome, Oh I am tring not to
not very creative
at all
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmaUjvUetmQ&feature=player_detailpage
baaam
Nothing special about her. She's just a pegasus.
Cant we agree that pretty much all OC's suck?
Are we seriously going to complain about people's OCs. If we keep this up, we'll be no different from Sonic fans.:|
OC = Original Character, so I do not agree
CCCP: yea, cause most OCs are alicrons
AJIsAwesome: is truth in those words
alicorns
going from scratch would be rather hard, would it?
Wow, harsh guys
OC's are original charaacters, all the char's in MLP are OC's
^
Gold_Demona: I don't have an OC, but it would be an earth pony just out of modesty :D
Ijust like the fact I have wings
thats enough final fantasy 8 for now
Bronysith i mean if people like them im fine with it, but most OC's are the same
/me hugs Pearly
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkcU54BO6Q4
CCCP: BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL ALICORNS
/me hugs CCCP
00,10\
Bronysith: Mine's not an alicorn. >=/
Bronysith Alicorns arnt that bad
Gold_Demona: i said most, not all
Sumica hello
Hey there, Sumica :)
CCCP: people insist on making theirs alicorns
yeah, made my OC a pegasus too
most aren't alicorns, because of what OC is by definition
Bronysith: only Faust can have an alicorn OC! :D
/me glomps Sumica in rage
MadSurge: THANK YOU
Bronysith do you have an OC?
Alicorns are fine, as long as they aren't Mary Sues.
the pinkie pie hair is still up in the air...
CCCP: yes, A UNICORN
00,10fucking game crash
Pearly: get rid of it
Hey Sumica!
Pearly: it is just a yellow pinkie pie with wings and a horn and it looks fucking stupid
00,10almost done with a mann up
I got otns of OC's, none based on me
the color is what I asked
00,105 bonus tickets
:o
Hi Sumica
in the 1930's people in the Mid west ate road kill :C
00,10HI ^_^
Bronysith, yeah
CCCP: ewww
Bronysith: Don't be a dick. Instead give advice on how to change it instead.
/me huggies Sumica
Pearly: get rid of that OC and actually make an oc
MadSurge its cus of the Great Depression and the Dust bowl so they couldnt grow food
Pearly: how about instead of using pony creator, get someone to draw it on a tablet
08,01rainbow have faith!
AJIsAwesome But the fact is that's not the case as most are OP as hell when they are alicorns meaning they are better then all
08,01you see i will bet you
Instead of being dicks and insulting people, why not just give them advice?
08,01somewhere out there is a pet that will get you
08,01RaveBrony: <3
CCCP I found it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QaGGSiA3yI
:$
Oh I will.. Bronysith
I don't care if people have crazy technicolor rave alicorn OC's, they're having fun, and that's--it
Because Capitalists are evil! the Great Depression wouldn't of happend if Capitalism wasnt real!!! :[
hi GigabitHarmonie
/me goes boom boom
0,5Ohey der
That song just literally give the feeling to RUN
BaconMane: Hey, BaconMane!
Pearly: and make sure it is actualy creative instead of named PEARLY PIE
CrimsonPhoenix oh awesome! :D
CCCP: don't get me wrong, if it depended on my life I would eat disgusting food. Still...
JUST RUN YOU KID THE GROUND'S FALLING APART
Pearly: relating your OC to the mane six is incredibly unorgiinal
Oh that is just from a quiz
Hello BaconMane! :)
08,01LoGaN: <3
MadSurge *huggies*
yay!!!!!!!!
Bronysith: come on... leave him be. he can make his OC how he wants
00,10that realy iratates, that close to the end and a ton of items
08,01hey CCCP
haha blame the ok cupid quiz for that
00,10and the game crashes
yay my name was in yellow :3
Eli: OC means original character, SO NOT ORIGINAL
But I do like the name Pearly though, without the pie
0,5CCCP
:o
CCCP: "(V)_(º,,,º)_(V)" zoidburg!
WHOO!
0,5See See See Pee
this is too amazing
BaconMane yay
Bronysith: That doesn't mean you have to be mean about it. :C
I don't think Original means what you think it does. OC are all characters not precreated, no matter how similar to things
OC's rock
0,5Oh god, OCs
CCCP: so was mine!
Some people are just hating
LoGaN :o
LoGaN /)
/me 08,01ships BaconMane and his OC
CCCP: /)
Bronysith: well... it isn't yours, is it? it has to be original for him. i don't find it very original either, but i don't judge him for it
0,5>>
00,10whats the worst is people with Alicorn OC's =p
Can we seriously drop the OC debate? We sound like Sonic Fans.:S
CCCP: how old you
Sumica, you mean like Rina-Chan?
08,01Sumica: what's wrong with alicorn OCs?
oc
0,5inb4 13
haha AJIsAwesome
I just thin it's odd that people think OC means "The pony that represents me"
LoGaN uhh
I agree
08,01CrimsonPhoenix: so?
0,5I think alicorns are fine as long as:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZmwlQy5bJk
0,5They dont have some dumb backstory
08,01i'm pretty sure Captain Kirk was a Mary Sue
LoGaN less than 20
0,5The dont have some OP status
more than 10
0,5They aren't related/involved with canon characters
im 13 the youngest brony here
08,01my OC is a god
0,5They arent made in pony-creator
08,01LoGaN: i'm younger than you
00,10her name was infact mary sue
0,5Then they're fine to me
Woah!! I thot it was +m for a sec there :D
Sumica, the original Marysue?
BaconMane Yep but how often is that now? just about most have that
00,10yep
0,5Yeah its wierd
I don't mind any OC's no matter what, cause I'm not reading abou them anyway
LoGaN actually i was born in 1917 kinda
08,01MASF123|: i'm 12
O_o
0,5Even ANIMATIONS are being made with pony creator
Lol. me too :3
jk
and what is this
0,5Its sickening -_-
/me hgs Gold_Demona
08,01>.>
BaconMane, you mean like BronyDanceParty?
/me hugs Pearly back
0,5Yeah
:D You go Sumica!
yeah I don't like those video either
hi guys :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAjDAU2RhmE
0,5He's a nice person and all but I don't like the way he animates
Hai Pikachu
im 16 :s
who?
Pikachu: Hello!
08,01i'm actually 25
Hot Diggity Demon?
I'm 21.
I'm 28. Does that make me the oldest?
I'm 18.
put a vector and wobble it
0,5Wha? Nooooo
13
isntant youtube hit
0,5Hot Diggedy Demon is awesome
(will not saay age)
I hatez him
I think his style is good, but I don't like his movies
0,5I love all the .MOVs
Is Wrek the oldest?
08,01also, i'm sitting at my computer with a box of Belgian chocolates
08,01life is fucking awesome
/me agrees with BaconMane
18 is an awesome age
O_O
*say
I think they're a bit dull, but his style is very fluid and neat, but too cartoony to be cool for anything but a joke
Vivix: HotDiggedy?
yaeh
0,5The whole thing is a joke, thats why it's funny
08,01LoGaN: chairman of a brony convention
Of course, but I don't think it's funny- it's not my taste, but his style is very suited to it
the man is a sicko.
Vivix, define too cartoony
very talented animator
nah id hate to live a day over 18
DId he ever make SWAG.MOV yet?
no bones, too fluid, rubberband reality changes to designs, etc
AJIsAwesome, not yet
08,01LoGaN: i'm not even making that up
wait is there a flim on?
He's GOOD, I like his style, but it's a joke style that I wouldn't enjoy in a serious thing
your fahking pulling my leg
18 is an awesome age
08,01LoGaN: i'm also a research assistant in Computer Science at University of St Andrews
if i had a dollar for every alicorn oc there is...i would be soooo fucking rich
wish I can be 18 again
Vivix, well it IS a parody
where you live well what city?
Pearly: (\
08,01but that's just for the summer
You'd have around 250 bucks bronysith
I liked the .MOV series until it got to the most recent one, PARTY.MOV. That was disgusting........:S
Vivix: add 10 more digits
Eli, ?
CrimsonPhoenix: Oh yeah, I'm not hating on it. It's just his style, and I like it, but it's only really suited to that kinda jokes
Vivix: a bit more i guess
08,01LoGaN: http://www.bronyuk.org/about-us/staff.html
HDD reminds me of the guy that animated Ren and Stimpy who has been to jail.
But hey, if you like the .MOV series? No problem.
I have seen under 5 alicorn OC's in my time at FIMFiction, unless I hunt for them I won't find more
Vivix, I'm sorry but you do make it sound like it's bad
Pearly: 18 year old brohoof /)
It's not my intention- I like his style. Sorry
OC's are ok.
08,01AJIsAwesome: (\
Shipping makes ne Lol.
me
agg, I think I would be the oldest here, but I could be wrong
08,01i'm also the princess of the night
Gold_Demona: you're two years older than me... :O
and I do believe Hotdiddgey can do more than that cartoony style
Vivix: i have once read a story with a pegasus that could do magic... worse than alicorns :(
08,01LoGaN: for the purposes of this conversation, yes
CrimsonPhoenix: oh yeah, he seems like a very talented guy. He's probably chosen that liquid style for the type of show hes doing, you know?
Pearly Oldest user here is like about 50
08,01also, goddamnit guys, it's "you're"
Pretty much yeah
Lol! :D
08,01as in, the contraction of "you are"
Indeed
killerpony7733, ah ok
yeah its you're retards!
Eli O.o that's odd. Yeah, In stories I'm very critical. But I don't tend to tell the author anything unless I think it would actually help him or her
I am just 20 years younger from them
08,01Eli: yes to that as well
>__>
any other pegasisters here?????
08,01i keep her in my basement, and only let her out for cooking and sex.

08,01LoGaN: absolve me?
/me hugs PillowPoni

WHATS HAPPENING?!?!
MadSurge; I lold at that too
0,5EVERYTHING
LOUD NOISES~
0,5LBGEIGBEDG
0,5>>
0,5<<
08,01MadSurge: heh, the censored cutie mark is just a bronystate in-joke. the actual one i normally use on my OC is a cornucopia
08,01but that's also a joke
0,5cornucopia?
08,01because... well, what's the other term for cornucopia?
:D O U
well, I will be 35 this november
08,01yes, that's right, "horn of plenty" :P
I don't have an OC and I'm happy with that
0,5horn of plenty
0,5ooooooh
0,5So it means you're horny often
i want oc
lol I was gonna say "There's another term for cornucopia?"
Pearly: Happy eventual birthday!
BaconMane: from the old myths :)
i want OC how i get one?
Thanks
0,5LoGaN assuming youre not kidding around you just make one
LoGaN You think of one. =P
LoGaN: You just draw one.
0,5Think of it in your head
You get it from your head
LoGaN: you commission an artist to draw you one
0,5Draw or think of, you dont gotta draw it
LoGaN: describe them w
0,5Choose good colors that look handsome though
umm long lost cousin of big mac
0,5Dont give accessories
LoGaN: what you want and have them draw it
use ur imagination LoGaN
/me murders LoGaN
LoGaN: that means related to applejack, related to a mane six member
0,5Broken horns / chipped ears / accessories = NO
Applejack has like 5 million cousins, not too far fetched
OC has a two pillows for a cutie mark
:o
Bronysith why? :(
0,5Also no connections to canon characters
/me gargle gargle (blood fills mouth from Bronysith)
I love broken horns and chipped ears, but not so much on ponies
LoGaN: If I were to give some suggestions, use the PonyMaker as a rough draft. Then draw your OC as the final draft.
0,5Its generally frowned upon
I don't know why it's frowned apon, since OC's haven't been important until they've been used in an actual story
there is mike none for pinkie pie at all...
0,5They arent supposed to be important in mlp canon
Vivix, haha 5 billion
Well damn, my OC has accessories O_o
of course not, fanon either unless they're used in a story
Well, hes clothed, lol
like Littlepip is an OC, NyX is an OC, and so forth
alicorn image with handbag on his head, is more an avatar than an oc since he has no story or use
I don't know if I should keep my OC a colt or not. I usually make them female.
Dat box should be your OC Vivix.
0,5I see ponies with like, earings and hoof bracelets and capes and spots on their face and dragon wings and lizard eyes and they're like "HEHEHE MY OC SHURE ISH PURDY"
Jmo: yeees
Vivix: It's generally frowned upon in ANY fandom
Yes, but I don't quite get why people care unless they're used in something they read or use
BaconMane: You mean, using that stuff in Pony Creator?
0,5Yes
Not drawing them in general? O.o
0,5Using pony creator is fine
0,5But dont make an attrocity of an OC ><
Vivix: I don't know either. I make OCs anyway cuz I think they're fun
BaconMane: as long as you don't abuse it/make a walking joke
I always have glasses when I draw my OC. Maybe because I wear glasses IRL
I've made a few, none of them ponies, and of course, none of them based on me or related to me in any way. But I haven't used them in anything
0,5Exactly MadSurge
Well, they're hardly OC*s, just designs
0,5Youre right
http://i.imgur.com/PPryN.gif
0,5THey're just Cs
Well, yeah. Some, but Original in legal terms
08,01but in pony form
but mine have no stories or character. They're just designs
You have a right to do whatever the heck you want with your OC, just like I have a right to gag at it
08,01he can buck things and make plants grow
:o
08,01he can also destroy equestria if he wants
08,01BUT HE CHOSES NOT TO
o_o
0,5Lemme guess: He's married to Celestia and gave birth to the mane 6
/me 08,01can feel BaconMane twitching
I kind of like my pony, but the yellow seems too yellow
0,5o__e
08,01BaconMane: no, of course not; he's celestia's cousin
0,5GAAAAHGVKEG VLKJVG LEKBGUGE
Lol
And then BaconMane rage
Pearly: Maybe make the yellow a little more faded?
hehehe
08,01MadSurge: and i've not laughed so hard all weekend
0,5!!!!
yeah thats what I was thinking too Gold_Demona
trololololol
I still have the PSD so I can do that
0,5This is my OC

Gold_Demona: I like your OC, it's unique without being ridiculous :3
but the outline, hrm..
0,5Stupid tumblr people, accusing me of being a friggin' carnivore
/me 0,5licks blood off his lips
MadSurge: Thank you. =)
hehe
BaconMane: dude, hay bacon strips as well.
lol BaconMane
Hay bacon strips ftw
0,5Exactly
08,01i once sneaked a pack of vegan bacon into the cinema
0,5its like melted down hay
BaconMane: fat joy and happiness. I love you.
0,5:D

Did I ruin your moment BaconMane?
0,5yesh ;___;
:>
0,5hehe
Are we watching the buffer show again?
hai VioletLynnScraton
I regret nothing
working on color for my pony was something that I just have to tackle
thelonepony: hello
0,5Colors on an OC
0,5Are the hard part
BaconMane: Tell me about it! Oy!
0,5Aaaand Ash joins to THAT
my internet derped can someone kick alexxm
0,5Nope
0,5You must wait
0,5You need to find the right color combo
I almost always draw black and white, or red and blue, so I hate colouring and choosing htem
dat Ash
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
Lazy Vivix.
alexxm u could of refresh the page u know
That's really hard. It took me forever to end up at the color combo I have on my OC/avatar/whatever-you-wanna-call-it.
Jmo: Whyyy...yes..okay but colouring is boring!
0,5My other OCs took me a while to figure out their colors
Jmo: Don't be mean -_-
Jmo: Is that an actual command or just "/me"?
I'm not being mean! I wub Vivix ;~;
Oh wow.
after I make my pony, I might make a page on FB
It's a mIRC command AJIsAwesome
I'm abused!
I like to color...
Shush you Vivix.
and to draw
Jmo: No u.
BaconMane: is a silver mane compatible with a blue coat for an OC? the blue is the color of RD but a tad bit darker.
I always get bored whiel colouring- but I love designing new characters, so it all ends up like uncoloured sketches
OH MIRC color.. ahh
/me glomps VioletLynnScraton
0,5Hmmmm. Silver mane...
0,5On a light blue coat....
08,01sagas: i blend in with all the other pinkie pie cosplayers :P
0,5yeah I can see it.
08,01i was camouflaged!
[17:01:57] <@BaconMane> Are the hard part - God damn it LC.

Calling me Ash, here!?
0,5Ucant say god dammit LC
BaconMane; okay then
Shame on you.
0,5>:
BaconMane: Are scars okay as long as they represent symbolism?
08,01VioletLynnScraton: bright pink curly hair
potato_pony, hi there
my goatalope has a blind eye due to being a sterile hybrid
0,5Uuuuuh, yeah, scars are okay, as long as you draw them in yourself. At least that isn't a pony creator fature
Morning everypony :)
Suddenly ALL the joins
08,01VioletLynnScraton: exactly
cachi01|mobile: Mornin'!
08,01VioletLynnScraton: my hair is actaully naturally very curly, and i've had it long for years
Morning cachi01|mobile
08,01so i dyed it pink
0,5I love how people are looking up to me as some kiind of OC advisor. I will change the world with handsome OCs!
oh WOW
anyways, brb
BaconMane: I know. If anything I use pony creator for rough drafts, then I redraw it and fine tune things.
cachi01|mobile, morning
cachi01|mobile: Hello!
/me gives cachi01|mobile cookies and some tea
Yay =D
I use pony creator to come up with color combos mostly
BaconMane Still way better than alicorn OC's with strips and are more powerful than the princesses :P
/me eats cookie and uses tea as a hat
Gold_Demona, same here
stripes*
anything more powerful than any of the princesses or queens make me frown
0,5Good thing LordCelestia wasn't a zebra!
in stories-
08,01alicorn male celestia with bacon for hair
08,01OH WAIT
08,01:P
This is nce. We're talking to each other more ofthen when there's no stream.:)
0,5Or powerful
LC could only manipulate bacon
*often*
my first thing to have somepony looks like fluttershy...
0,5Wait a god darn second, I never said LC was more powerful than princesses. I said he lived in a wacky alternate equestria where everything was about bananas and bacon. And communism.
08,01Pearly: heh, funny story...
for my pony
0,5>:I
story?
08,01we had a moderator on here way back when, whose OC was fluttershy but with slightly different coloured hair, and glasses
BaconMane Ah, yes. Lord Bananabutt was his nickname, wasn't it?
Pearly: story is optional. My pony has no story. :P
0,5I remember her o:
08,01she was... a little cray cray
0,5Well duh
oh I remember her. and hten she spammed us like crazy
0,5CRAI ZHAY
There's nothing wrong with being crazy. ;~;
0,5DashWithRainbows: stuf <:

Manwhore
Gold_Demona: More like R34....

Nope.avi
DaringDerpy: Yeah, I'm like huh?

You will in a minute damn you.
/me puts Vivix on a jet

Vivix: Sexologist? Did you just make that up? :S
there is no stream
Oh lord >.>
no, it's a branc within psychology
Nope that actually exists
hai spitfirecolt no stream right now
and yeah, interesting stuff, but I would be far to nervous to actually be a therapist
I wub psychology. So interesting.
Hey I'm new to this site...what is it?
TiNYCL0Ud: It's Bronystate! Welcome!
Welcome tinycloud :)
mostly about horses
hi TiNYCL0Ud
Vivix: Too awkward to be a sex therapist. Probably mostly couples counseling
hay everypony
Technicolor little horses
hey spitfirecolt
Hi spitfirecolt!
I know what Mlp is =3=
welcome to Bronystate TinYCL0UD
/me gives spitfirecolt some tea and cookies

I love the Newcastle Ale commercials :D
/me takes takes the tea and cookies gladly
What is sports?
Tinycloud ok here is what we do. We wait for someone to stream PMV or a series or some youtube videos
TiNYCL0Ud: most of the times someone makes a videostream
Ok...
:D enjoy spitfirecolt
the rest of the time we just do horse stuff
Tinycloud then in fridays we watch 2 MLP episodes and 2 movies =D
Cool c:
saturday for us european slaggers
Vivix: Wow that sounds like a very useful field. Very rare and specialized im guessing. I can see them working in prisons
i love movie nite
Ah, welcome TiNYCL0Ud. Bronystate is a site wear bronies come together to watch movies and pony episodes on Friday (Brony movie night) and on Saturday (Same movies as BMN, just at a more convenient time for those in Europe, so it is known as the Euroshow.) During the week however, moderators may stream things such as games to art. Though, please take note to freshen yourself on the rules.
AJIsAwesome: sports ew. Why not talk about fluffy and fun stuffs?
tl;dr
Movie night is best spammin night lol
sagas yeah, a lot of them do I suppose. And counseling for couples, and just general research.
:>
/me is watching Starship Troopes again

Ok then
cowvarkian: Its one of my favorite shows. I have the first 5 seasons on DVD

RD and Twilight Sparkle get fused together because of some mysterious accident.

I'm questioning my broniness. I listened to some Animal Crossing music and had a much stronger reaction then I've ever had in MLP outside of Derpy speaking.
Sumica: actually, yes :) all ponies are best pony

also best pony is rarity obviously
RD is best pony. period.
WOOOOOOOO! BURN NOTICE!

Welcome back Dark92Enigma
vince vahn?
cachi01|mobile: Tsk tsk tsk. Don't worry. Just tell him the truth. No need to lie. If he doesn't like it just ignore it and go on life and enjoy what you enjoy. If you watch MLP and he can't tolerate it to bad.
Tovler: It's okay. Not everyone has a huge reaction to MLP related things.
Hello Dark92Enigma
how you're doing, alexxm?
I would just let him get burned and walk away
i'm good Dark92Enigma
Dem lSD..colors.
Pinkie pie > rarity = twilight > AJ > rainbow dash

Oh yeah this video. I love it :3
00,10the re-watch on my end is fine
Woah, when did Miss fleur get here?<3
I instantly became hooked on the show when Applejack first appeared on the show.
Pinkie Pie>Rainbow Dash>Fluttershy>Applejack>Twilight Sparckle>Rarity
I like Rarity myself.
my opinion don't kill me for it.
Your favorite is fluttershy? http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7642/
Sweetie Belle is best pony
toy with hime some more why dont you!
MASF123|afk: No problem.:)
Im a Rarity fan, love that classy gal;)
giggity
I think it is all down to personal preferece but AJ is my favorite
However that's my Name 6 pick.
/me resents Fluttershy since he's just like her in real life.
I got hooked on the show into the first 5 minutes of "Lesson Zero" watch every single episode that was out at the time that same weekend.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7721/
lPonies are best, and with all ponies I mean rarity
free long distance is best long distance
how convenient. I wouldn't show an intruder how much time he has
Ponies47: Lesson Zero is best episode
cachi01|mobile: Haha
All*
sagas: One of my favorites
dat bomb
I like AJ because not only is she down to earth, she is the most openly supportive and caring for her friends (IMO).
^
no gloves?
Lesson Zero and Party of One are pretty much the best first-impressions episode.
no fingerprints left, DaringDerpy
RD > Twi > Pinkie > AJ > Flutter > Rarity
Sweetie Belle is best pony
Maxiburgers Tumblr is up to episode 19, it seems to me that the most popular pony in japan is Applejack.
Spy!
I'm not related to AJ in terms of personality, but I find her inspiring.
:D
Rex_Mundi: IKR?
00,10I cant pick a fave CMC
Bet its Vahn
AJIsAwesome: As in hard-working, and honest?
explosives
stable people are the worst
AJIsAwesome: Yes, Applejack is a rolemodel, more so than... Pinkie Pie, for example.
sagas: vince vaughn?
such a drama queen
cowvarkian: not quite...
mmk
so hard to pick best pony
All the CMC are awesome :3
Dark92Enigma: More than that. She seems like a friend I could've needed when I was at my lowest point in life.
Dem CMC
Skootaloo is best CMC!
00,10seen some cute CMC pictures with soldier
Sweetie Belle is best pony
all dem rads
Can I pick Sumicas OC pony for best pony at this moment?
I don't have a worst favorite pony or best CMC.
sure
Ill agree, Rex_Mundi
*least*
/me cries after listening to AJIsAwesome.....
My real favs are: Pinkie Pie>Cheerilee>Apple Bloom>Trixie
Asking someone who is best CMC is like asking a gamer what is his favorite game
worst favorite
kill Vahn before he gets to you and connect the dots!
I disconnected so
ah cool Burn Notice havent seen this on the stream in awhile :)
Such inspiring words.....:'(
/me hands Dark92Enigma a tissue "It's okay."
all quiet on the western front

08,01hm
nemnemnemnem
CrimsonPhoenix: Hahaha! That's awesome!
08,01question: the only uni in this country that does a particular masters course i'm interested in is what i would consider a crap university
CrimsonPhoenix epic episode is epic
08,01but i think i could really make something good of the course they give
Sumica: our website too :(
08,01even if 90% of people who do that course do not
00,10ohdear
08,01let's just say that one of my hobbies is going around the scottish security conferences, winning CTF competitions
08,01and i was really not impressed by the standard of people doing this course at their own CTF
Rex_Mundi: What are you talking about?
Rex_Mundi: Kind of like Radio Graffiti. At least HIS broadcast is over.
Rex_Mundi: Oh wait. I know.
08,01(CTF = a hacking competition to pwn boxes provided by the conference)
fun
08,01what do, bronystate?
Radio Graffiti was awsome, it was a joke y'know.
AJIsAwesome its at £130 last i checked
Rex_Mundi: I know. :D
Chrysalis: :O
Rex_Mundi: I feel JS should just go off air. He's nothing but a scum sucker.
£133 AJIsAwesome

AJIsAwesome £141 now

Everlasting_Joy: *sigh*
Everlasting_Joy: JS was good at one point, but at this time its just a wraith, devoild of all merit.
£151
damnit
im not going above £150
Chrysalis: WOW.:O
AJIsAwesome: Hey, we don't have to listen to him or Springer, and by not listening or bringing them up in conversation, we're going what we want.
08,01AJIsAwesome: http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/221115039977
I think it would be fun if we had tals like ponies.
08,01my current bid is £200
08,01feel free to outbid me
08,01i doubt i'll be bidding any more on it, to be honest
I'm more into shirts and other merch than toys IMO.
you know, we COULD deliberately bet to £190
ohhh noes MakerDusk lost fluttershy D:
what
http://theadmin.co.uk/ScrSnp/Tx6a80.png
network issues. the fluttershy ponychat server is gone
=o
i think im just gonna give that £150 to bittertea and get myself a plushie
08,01Chrysalis: i woulnd't particularly care if you did; i bid £200, and that's what i'm currently prepared to pay
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: fluttershy has always been my least favorite pony anyways :p
yeah somethings up with the chat server i guess
Wait. Ebay doesnt have a questions section?
00,10yeah they know pony with long string of numbers
Tara strong is right, nopony should go on springer, he just wants this to be the bronies equivelent to Chewfox on the Tyra banks show.
08,01Chrysalis: well, it's going to a good cause. not sure what cuase, but i'm sure it's good.
pony_232525: the city of chicago is down... lets have a moment of silence for all the poor people there who can no longer get online
Rex_Mundi: Yep.
unless its to actually bid more than £200, anyone betting is just makin you pay
MakerDusk: What's going on in CHicago?
Hi :)

MakerDusk: Alrighty then
What is this? These aren't the videos... or jokes... that I know and love
also, our backup website will be online within a minute
lol
you see, when a server goes down, it's actually because they forgot to feed Kabaka again, so he gets hungry and eats servers
Was I the only one that crashed right now?
wait, im jim
Why not gut his, well, gut?
MY EAR SMELLS WEIRD
how ca you smell your ear
Bronysith, how?
OK
Bronysith: How do you know that?
/me sips his tea
RIGHT
cowvarkian cut it off, ask van gogh
hmm
true
Who ells want to see an episode based on Twilights mom and dad and the other parental figures in the show?
/me puts a moth in Major s tea
Rex_Mundi: it was not, no
Um....
Okay...
Rex_Mundi me, I'm always interested in Backstory on everything
if you want to see what servers you were on, the command is /whowas <nick>
/me gives Major a box
kirzstryfe: I so tossed that comment of yours into the opers channel
>.>
Okay...............
So, can we just assume AJs parents are dead?
also, /whois and /whowas were both down right after the netsplit, is that normal?
:D
Major, dont you want to know whats in your box?
<.<
Okay, I guess that was a full-episode punchline to a joke that I missed the setup to.
sure
Bronysith: Nope, its just another box for starting a fire for me....:P
00,10Kandarihu, it was the pitch pilot
Major, sotr of right
Ah, I SEE.
kirzstryfe: they were working for me
Major, it is an incindary grenade and it just exploded
I never saw that on Adult Swim
this is neat
Major,so now you are on fire
What is this song?
probably on my end then
discord
Dance Sumi, dance
Bronysith: yay~ Now I can make Smores! :3
Major: Mmm!
anyways, off to work with me
catch you all later
Rex_Mundi: Let's wait for Season 3 to explain.
Take care MakerDusk!
MakerDusk: Bye!
Cya MakerDusk
AJIsAwesome: let's wait for canon to fill us in :D
/me licks Midnight_Stormwing
AJIsAwesome, and then instead we'll have a Granny Smith is dead episode
fun
that'll be in season 4
MadSurge: THat's what I say to most fan things.
I can imagine that there can be based on Fluttershys parrents. What if she feels like a dissapointment to them because she doesnt fly as well as them? Like what if Fluttershy is descended from a proud line of fast flyig ponies and shs the odd one out?
CrimsonPhoenix: that would be a riot :(
00,10s3 needs seaponies
you know, the "wierd shit that hasnt happened yet season"
agreed Sumica
Diabeetus.
other 20% falls on twilight
Sumica: :D
season 4 = wierd shit that hasnt happened yet season
ONE TWO
AND JAB, JAB
SB needs to be here everytime we play this :).
00,10yes they need a body swap ep and a gender swap ep
unless its something like (anything with j.j. abrams)...
season 3 needs more CONSISTENCY
cowvarkian: just wait till the next pony generation (G5)
hmm
00,10but most of all s3 need 26 eps >_>
I actually considered working out with this video.:D
Sumica for the body swap I want the voice to stay with the body and not soul
will it be executive produced by j.j. abrams? Rex_Mundi
Sumica: I'm worried about what the new villain might be :D
Sumica: I wouldn't be surprised if there's something in the background we aren't aware of concerning episode count at this point.
00,10new villain is megan for g1
Nptice how Applebloom changes color every time AJ kicks.
*Notice*
Sumica: :D
BOOOO RD
with some stephen speilburg...
Sumica: What a twist!
*spielburg
00,10WOW dat heavy system lockup
ANIME TIME
GHOST IN THE SHELL!
00,10thought my computer died

I think........:S
G5 mlp, executive producer j.j. abrams, and stephen spielburg...
noooooo!!!
Ghost in the Shell time!
cool GitS love the op and ed themes
DIE DOLL
gits sac?
Im guessing that the season from now on will have less episodes, so they can have the show have more seasons and thus on air longer. Plus this gives time for hour long specials and maybe movie/s. If thats the case than i might be OK with 15 episode long seasons
Is this show still continuing?
Good afternoon y'all :)
haha Squall <3
Never seen this show, looks good.
Fisheh_Fish: Hello!
YES YES YES
Hello Fisheh_Fish
Sumica: stream Perfect Blue, please :D
as long as they have an actual plot in it, Rex_Mundi
Just in time for Ghost in the Shell
Sumica, if you stream code ment ill let you stab my shins
00,10would have to use hulu for that one
Rex_Mundi: I don't know how many episodes there are, as long as they're good.
Rex_Mundi: I don't *mind* how many episodes there are, as long as they're good.
00,10not exactly a stealth tank
I remember this one
I sortof want MLP to stop being seen as a show for girls, but meh
That tank needs +5 Sneak.
/me glomps twilight_sprinkle
twilight_sprinkle,hi
was the chat ded?
Scorpion tank?
cowvarkian: Same here. It was meant for ALL AGES.
DED
sure
00,10server issues twilight_sprinkle
ITS BACK UP
/me nomz Bronysith "Hai :3"
Sumica: mkay
Sumica: it works now
lol. Hey Bronysith . You having issues too?
dat tank needs to be nerfed
flutter_spin,it wokrks now
i thought it was server issues, since i couldnt log in from any broser or my phone
Especially how people percieve male viewers of the show/ people who arent in the "normal" target demograpic >.>
but yeah
love that spider tank
dat talking robot :D
aaaaaand i'm back. first: stream lagging hard. secondly: what just happened with the embedded chat?
cowvarkian: Who, or better yet, why, care what others think?
Oh, I don't
Am i the only 1 who gets a lot of constant random buffer
cowvarkian: IMO, there's isn't a show for a specific gender. Any show can be for any gender.
what is this called what is the movie called?
rainbow: ghost in the shell. deries
*series
"Ghost in the Shell" TV Series
rainbow: Ghost In The Shell. TV show.
i want MLP to stay a show for children and not have it more adult-oriented
anyone else lagging?
^
nope
I just don't like how people percieve shows should be for specific genders, AJIsAwesome
twilight_sprinkle: I actually want a mixture of both, IMO.
Why make AIs if you know they'll go berserk? /)_(\
But its just societies gender roles
ghost in the shell Ajisawesome? whats that
little lag, but I'm hoping it will work out
cowvarkian: Same here.
Is is wierd that I greatly prefere Brushable toys compaired to the Blindbags because i like the pretty brushable hair?
rainbow: Cyberpunk anime.
this is my fav anime
ok
a bit lag here and there
Good. It's working agian :3
AJIsAwesome: id prefer it if it stayed mostly for children, a few adult jokes are fine as long as theyre clean. but other than that, if i wanted tgo watch adult stuff id watch something else
Rex_Mundi: Nope. Everyone has quirks that make them who they are.
00,10I like the McD's brushables they atleast look like em
Rex_Mundi: huh. I'm the opposite, because I like small nonmovable figures
lol, yeah Sumica
who banned me?
Rex_Mundi: No, nothing wrong with that at all. Heck, I'd prefer the brushables due to their (generally) better quality then the blindbags.
and...is the stream down now for everyone else too?
i missed the entire McD pony wave :(
lag!
But, people give no shits if women watch shows targeted towards men, or boys, but if men or boys watch shows for women, or girls then shit goes awry
DaringDerpy: stream is up, chat was having problems earlier
oh
twilight_sprinkle: True. If I can ask you a question, what do you think about the abundance of adult jokes in Animaniacs?
boring
cowvarkian: double standard
mhmm
But what men would want to watch Twilight ... the movie that is
AJIsAwesome: ive never seen that show, sorry
no stream for me...but chat works again
I love that, AJIsAwesome
why dis so boring
twilight_sprinkle: I wasn't a brony until after the McD waves........:'(
I loved animaniacs
Double Standard is BS:|
oh...now I have stream
flutter_spin: snark potential? :D
there we go
00,10because you touch your self at night
/me puts Sumica in a ghost Maid corset
No lag for the past 2 minutes for me.
cowvarkian, most media is targetted at men anyway. For a woman to limit herself to watching female-targetted media can be very limiting.
sumica whut the hell up no one likes you go away
it somewhat works now
AJIsAwesome: i want a twi from mcd, but buying a toy from mcdonalds feels odd..
im back
I actually liked this episode
and barely did i say itt, another buffer
true, Kandarihu
s
00,10how cute it's trying to provoke
lol
he just trolling
i think mips is being a bitch again
twilight_sprinkle: Animaniacs is a cartoon show made by Warner Bros in the 90s. It had a LOT of adult jokes that most children wouldn't catch. Suprisingly, it had a lot of seasons and is critically accaimed.
alt least in gemrnay
Dark_Horst: its ok for me
Hugs @Sumica <3
Oh. Jibogachi = Chekhov's Gun.
IM BACKKKKKKKKK6_9
Dark_Horst: im not in Germany tho
Yeah, it was a wonderful cartoon, AJIsAwesome
sumica you really pis me off
00,10that's nice
Hye fluttermac welcome back :3
rex are you gay or something
*Hugs* AJIsAwesome
Sumica: Wait, what's rainbow doing?
I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT WRE WATHCING
Rex_Mundi: Why did you hug me?
Ghost in the Shell: TV Series
fluttermac, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex
stream is being not good
AJIsAwesome: well some people like adult jokes, im usually not a fan of such things. i like Mlp because it lacks the vulgarness of real life
hi everyone
00,10commuting on the short bus AJIsAwesome
Uhhh, because AJIsAwesome?
it's fun, becasue the german dub has the voices of stargate. all 4 of em
Hey Darkts3|Trader|MLG2
Rex_Mundi: Okay.:)
I love this tank backstory
why is celestia watching luna sleep:O
because rex is a gay lord and likes too hug he should be called happy spanas
or something like dat
Is that a no? Rex_Mundi
its Fleur
There's nothing gay about hugging.
steam needs moar G 3.6 :)
O_O
dat gun
im not gay
unless you're starting to hump the one hugged
dat music
twilight_sprinkle: True. I only like specific adult jokes and there should be only a few. Not every episode should be littered with them, IMO.
i think rainbow needs a hug
kandarihu dont try guard him because your gay too
seems legit
Well, animaniacs really wasnt for kids
rainbow: I think you need a hug.
rainbow, I'm not gay either.
/me hugs rainbow
lololol:P
AJIsAwesome: as long as theyre not sex-related,im fine
/me Hugs rainbow :3
/me is bi
twilight_sprinkle: Same here. I never liked sex jokes. Too raunchy.
that's a huge-ass AM rifle
Everypony hug rainbow! :D

woot!
^
what show is tis
/me spins
Because they're immature and stupid? LunarSS
ponies your gay too next thing your gonna be sucking dicks
uigg
LunarSS: Because they can't think.
LunarSS: IKR?
:)
/me thinks that making a big deal out of sexual preferences is silly. Hugging is hugging is hugging.
Wht's up with rainbow? so un-Brony
rainbow: Shut up and leave.
I prefere gay in its orriginal uage, oldtimey for carefree and happy!
Oh a troll:|
/me coughs on swallowing a chunk of tomato whole
oh rainbow u terrible troll
then why do you bid at all, Chrysalis?
AJIS what about no
rainbow: It's okay to not like things but don't be a dick about it.:|
rainbow: It's Ponies47 and I like hugs. Hugging is nice and friendly :3
yay im a troll
Good salad. Just have to watch for those tomatoes
I fear he will go that far, Chrysalis
I'm fine with people calling me gay...
00,10nah you are not a troll.
AVOID TROLL BAIT.
So he's a Brony troll??
00,10Trolls are clever, you are just sad

Mom bought me them. Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Little Mermaid.. she got me all the CDs
^_^
This is beauty and the beast
hmm
I have those torrents, or most of them, flutter_spin
TheKatPony tarzan has an amazing soundtrack
flutter_spin, cds?
lol probably cuz ur downloading to many mods
/me Never saw Beauty and the Beast
you know, compact discs
Tarzan songs were good, yeah ^^
i should have watched all these old disney movies to get this right?
long ago CrimsonPhoenix , music CDs
OH
MUSIC Cds
that's pretty cool
they came before the internet
TheKatPony: there were songs in tarzan?

Tarzan songs are the only songs i like from a disney movie

Maybe
all my music on cassets and all my steam games on floppy disks
And the Taking out Trash, song? Trash Camp.. something
That and the UP theme
/me likes all disney movies, but probably because of childhood
Yeah, the Tarzan songs were really good

<.<
lol. Dat "Belle" mouth
No one is gaston like gaston
Everlasting_Joy: isn't gaston the ahole?
yeah
the cast in this is well done
I thought Sweete Belle would be Bell
she doesnt have as many thigns to take from
*things
irrelevant, How to join multiple channel????????
Everlasting_Joy: more like "noone is rainbower than Gaston" :D
Eli: Yeah, but if you haven't seen B&B, Gaston has a phrase to him, "Nobody X's like Gaston."
DerpyMuffins, name aside Belle LOVES books
Finally. Pinkie.

YES more SaC :3
brb
ok?
why should you care what they think, Fisheh_Fish
bye
this show is just fantastic
bye
other then the whole parent tbing
*thing
I used to stay up and try to watch it on Toonami
I'd make a "budget" joke here, but clearly GitS had a great one.
cowvarkian: I know I shouldn't care, but their comments and looks that they give me when they see me watching it irritates me
hmm
Eli Thx for somehow reminding me of Xion :`(
And they give no shits about the actual community surrounding it, or anything?
cachi01|phone: poor xion :(
Fisheh_Fish: I showed this to my mom watch. She was NOT amused.
We watching anime now
?
DerpyMuffins: Yes.
showed my mom winter wrap up......
DerpyMuffins: yep, Ghost in the Shell
Ghost in the Shell.
She has a thing versus guns.
ded
she loved it :)
Oh this one. This one is weird.
my mom has seen some mlp, she's fine with it
Wow ^^
Eli its so freaking sad how nobody will remember who she was
SPLAT
I just went to magic town and talked to the fairy lady and she told me to talk to her friend and her friend disappeared .o.
My parents don't really care :/
Suicide?:S
My folks don't know.
Yep.
cachi01|phone: that reminds me: i have an old ds and the 2 ds games around somewhere^^ got something to do now
yeah, mine don't really care either, but they're fine with me watchign it
then she decided to watch 2 episodes with me
Eli lol
ɾ
Damn i need moneh for KH 3D
TheKatPony: Yeah, my parents didn't care at first, but now they just shoot me glares
Naw. My mom walked away after 15minutes of the first episode. She did not approve.
This stream is toast for me.
because you watch cartoons for girls? Fisheh_Fish
Flutter_spin she laughs at me
I just finished watching Mirai Nikki
flutter_spin: So she doen't want you watching it?
Everlasting_Joy: she liked it
Cherileee's a wwhhoooorrrrse. :S
*doesn't*
with good voice acting, and writing
cowvarkian: Yeah, what's up with that? What guy would ever watch a cartoon for little girls?
Biltasar is it like a yume nikki fan game?
and a nice community built around it
and yeah, ikr Fisheh_Fish
She has this way of denial/disapproval. She rather I ... <insert X here>... then waste my time with <insert Y here>
Sumica erm GITS?
Boltasar*
00,10yeah Panda
I actually watched like, winx club and shit when it first aired...
My sister isn't happy with me liking the show, though. She doesn't really believe I really watch it lol
my mom would prefer me watching/listening Nicki Minaj rather than MLP because that's normal...
and other girls cartoons
my dad doesnt really care that i watch it and my 2 bros are also bronies :)
they're actually mostly pretty good
cachi01|phone: no, its about a survival game, survivor gets to be the god of time and space
teets are important plot element yo
To be honest, no show should be for a specific gender. I know guys who like Strawberry Shortcake and Hello Kitty.
Eli: Or obsessing with Justin Bieber or something lol
back
Ponies47: Welcome back!
cachi01|phone: in english it would be called Future Diary
Boltasar sounds cool
wb Ponies47
When I say "girls cartoons" i mean "cartoons marketed towards girls"
Jeris are all being turned into sexbots.
Nikki is diary yeah
TheKatPony: i would rather kill myself
If I watch something with guns, she will say "Don't watch that. It has guns in it." and walk away
Sumica I dont recognize the episode, is this before or after the laughing man
My mom LIKES me watching MLP. She's goign with me to Canterlot Gardens (Does she bucking have to? -_-) my dad is meh and doesn't really give to flying feathers
00,10before
Lord of the Rings - she is totally cool with

Ponies47: THat's awesome.:O
so, guns are no, but swords and shit are yes?
I live with three sister that are OBSESSED with Justine Bieber. X_X
cachi01|phone: but if you are gonna watch it I advice looking for it with its japanese name.
Justine XD
justine bieber....
Ponies47 u r 14 i think she has to lol
TheKatPony: :(, I'm sorry to hear that.
I always typo that
cowvarkian: I know.
mhmm
Sumica D: I havent seen anything before hand!
TheKatPony: i know someone though, who is obsessed with him. and her dad has the money to back it up. she met him a few times. doesn't speak a word english, but she's sure she's gonna marry him...
Oh, I just noticed that it's been a while since the last buffering
Eli: :S
might be going to Equestria LA :)
cachi01|phone: I know Quick_Thinker is going. We're going to meet up there
I hate it when girls think they are gonna mary someone famous.
AJIsAwesome: right?
Oh cool :)
"DONT TOUCH JUSTIN, HES MINE!"
lol
TheKatPony: when you say girls, you mean teenage girls, right
or just the insane ones
or both
cowvarkian: yep, im not like that though.
My Toys R Us has a Justin Beuber cardboard cutout at the front gate. Gets a load of attention (and a bunch of laughs)
i know lot's of crazy ppl. most of them are my friends. ok now i'm starting to think there's something wrong with me
TheKatPony: He'll be a fad, just like the Jonas Brothers.
Yep ^^
I guess the people in my house aren't the only ones who suddenly learned how to randomly teleport for no reason o__o
I forgot they existed, their voices changed, right? AJIsAwesome
then they split up and actually became something good
sortof
I know Kevin got married
flutter_spin: Any moustaches on him?

Eli: We're all crazy, but that makes us who we are. That's why there are so many different people in the world.:)
flutter_spin: Huh, well, there is good there isn't any for Toys R Us's sake.

cachi01|phone: It varies depending on airline and which airport you leave from/go to
Major: proper grammar is the difference between life and death
Ponies47: bad idea. they don't know i'm a brony

AJIsAwesome: what's there?
Bronysith: Yeah, you don't want the Grammer Nazi's hulling you off.

Everlasting_Joy: exactly
My coworkers think its cool I'm a MLP fanfic writer, more than I watch MLP
Bronysith: so proper grammer is gonna stop a bullet? :P
Eli: Tell them before Canterlot Gardens comes around. You have a little over a month to do so and get everything you need

^
/me knows how to shoot a gun
They get Jeris to have something to hug, because Sweetiebot isn't real.
Bronysith: Ive shot a gun before, and I can take pictures to prove it if you want :P
I play TF2. i sure know how to use a gun :P
You just take the safety off, aim and pull
I have never shot a gun but I have held one
cowvarkian: no, you press the trigger
>.>
cowvarkian: theres a little bit more to that :P
Ponies47: same here ^^
cowvarkian: pulling it affects the trajectory actually
I was putting it in basic terms
Bronysith: you dont press triggers, you PULL them
geeze
AND FRIENDSHIP
Major: if you go 1 week without stupid emotes i will give you one game off steam
Dark_Horst: no
lol
Bronysith: orlly?
Bronysith: yes
Dark_Horst: you press it cause if you pull it, it affects the aiming
Bronysith: will you give me one game off steam, I never use emotes
cowvarkian: i just want Major to stop with the emotes
I know
^^
yea, this episode was very weird as I recalled :P
Bronysith: triggers are being pulled. they have ever been. hell, the german word for them has pull in it
Bronysith: alright, if I go one week without using emotes you will give me any game on steam I want?
I need to buy some more pony shirts for Canterlot Gardens ;_:

Dark_Horst: well my instructor said to treat it like a press because when you think pull you might pull the actual gun UP
oh shit ^^
Canadian Amb?
Major: even when im not here you cannot do it
Ponies47: I haven't found any wristbands of any kind......:(
Bronysith: how hard does he pull it?

cowvarkian: to blow your mind, her body isn't exactly real
Dark_Horst: kewlio at least you aren't faking it like Major
Ponies47: All I have are shirts and pair of sunglasses.
cowvarkian: 1. not police 2. she is a robot
ikr flutter_spin
be that way, LunarSS
Major: now
LunarSS, she's not a robot. She's a cyborg.
oh, ok
Holy spit. The voice acrtess of Applebloom and Sweetie Belle is going to Canterlot Gardens as well! :O
cyborg
Ponies47: Have you checked out WeloveFine?
Bronysith: again, I can take pictures of those targets I shot if you want
Ponies47: IKR?:O
Ponies47: OOOO!
Major: pictures of targets does not prove anything
duh.
Kandarihu: well her body is fully robotic
Ponies47: you're trying to emotially kill me right?
Bronysith: even with bullet holes in them?
Major: a video of you shooting the targets might prove it
free will.
LunarSS, yes. But her brain is real. That's what separates her from being a robot.
AJIsAwesome: Yes! I have plenty of shirts I want from them
Eli: No :(
Major: i can take a picture of a poster with holes in it and say i did it
Major: not that hard
dat hand story
TheKatPony: eeyup

ghost, in the shell?
ah, ok so real brain and robotic body

Bronysith: well whatever, you believe what you want and I'll stick to the truth
kirzstryfe: YEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
<.<
Major: that your girlfriend is a liar?
that was fantastic
dial up tone
Major: and you also made up a lie about me?
Every... single... exchange.
lol
Bronysith: She isnt a liar you moron
/)ō3ō(\
Major: no one gets shot, next day sees a movie and goes back to paris in 3 days
fin
/me applauds
Major: a hospital holds you for a week from getting shot and flying affects the wound
All right, I'm going to go play some TF2. Take care fillies and gentlecolts!
hmm
Brave
Major: she is a liar and so are you
Everlasting_Joy: Bye!
later Everlasting_Joy
Everlasting_Joy: bye my brother
so, why is Bronysith being an asshat?
Bronysith: it was a miss understanding, I would explain it to you but I don't think that you'll understand logic
cowvarkian: aye
I swear, I thought the lyrics at the beginning were "She's so cooly human."
^
Major: what? she said she got shot and flew to paris 3 days later, YOU CAN'T FLY AFTER GETTING SHOT not that soon actually
hothothot
Major: who the hell are we talking about
Major: and i never hit on your girlfriend, you lieing marine wannabe

No wait I'm 14 and if your 13 you get in free at Canterlot Gardens. So if your 13 or younger your mostly treated like a kid. So my guess is if I'm 14 they treat you like a adult

No.
NO.
501 dollars per adult.....
NO.
Dammit
Major: you cannot fly after being shot that soon

Oh, Pinkie.
Are these special Halloween servers?
Well I have to find something to eat. See you guys later.
cowvarkian: who knows, he started this stupid fight ever since I met my girlfriend

It would've been nice if the Engineer's Sentry had been locking onto the ghost until it died, at which point the sentry would just go back to search-mode
