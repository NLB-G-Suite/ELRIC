You know, I think it would awesome to hangout with Pinkie. So much energy

Metal Twilight !
DIE
Ganon in the tub
Screw you guys, I like G3.5
I just had a crazy thought. If someone hooked a chip to your brain so that you get a virtual pony in which only you see and hear, what pony would you like to meet today?
Lol
/me slaps and grabs WindWhistler
WindWhistler: GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF
/me is immune to Bronysith[M]'s slap

WindWhistler: Has you gone mad?! You destroying logic! LOGIC! NYAHAHAHAH! *jumps out of window*
WindWhistler: *hugs* I actually enjoy all of the generations. G3.5 is my least favorite, but it has it's moments.
wow wind DAFUQ

Without G3.5, we wouldn't have many of the G4 characters...
ultimate randomness
CURSE YOU TALKING DOG!

Pinkie Pie, Cherilee, Scootaloo, Sweetie Belle...

Honestly, the thought of "a pony rotation for each day of the week" would be kind of cool, but if I had to choose - Twilight
this is hurting my eyes
LOL
*GASP*
Pinkie is not a good pony to play KSP with
WHAT?!?!!?!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6BDvfgRF4s

Sylandest: Oh yeah, and if you have anything to say to me directly, a pm would probably work better, I am distracted.
Om: no problem, you're all good, hehe. I'm just bopping about
Irish_Pony: Maybe only for the salute, but the march can be still or moving
00,10minmay is a bimbo
SolairePony89: Well to bad I have no bloody idea how desktop ponys work :P
I wonder what Cadence's name would be if she was a Molestia. Luna's Lunaughty, I just wonder what Cadence would be
She falls asleep REALLY quickly
random thought over
ping?
Irish_Pony: That sucks
00,10Irish_Pony, it's rather simple realy.
Using the Earth's gravitational field to power a weapon? I don't think that would work

0,14Robotech?
/me misses his bunny :'(
Listen to ALL the old guys
Suddenly, a 5 year old screaming orders at me
0,14...holy crap, it IS Robotech
Sumica : i miss the good old days when this anime was on TV
00,10he did't speak as much in the JP version so he had to deliver lines fast in the US version as they used him alot for exposision
0,14also dat Sumica desktop pony
00,10yep
Who... is that OC?
00,10guess Panda
sumica
oops
Sumica: you?

Sumica: saxy gave it away first ;)
Panda: very good!
Meanwhile, thousands of miles away...
But the idea was cancelled when it would cost serveral millions of dollars :P
Irish_Pony: That's a LOT of paint
0,14>.>
Sumica: why is your OC doing the "monkey"?
0,14the only thing I know of Robotech is the game for the Gamecube
I don't understand why that would break anyone's morale
It looks more like Twilight's dance
Panda: Ho ho ho!
Same here Saxy
SaxyPretender: THIS HAD A GAME?!
00,10why paint the mountain red when you can bomb a few citys instead.
Lucid[M]: They're defacing a symbol of their country
I can read some of this
00,10cause it is WindWhistler
I'm taking a Japanese course
I dont think it's possible to humiliate the Japanese. Only piss them off
0,14yep, Irish_Pony, Robotech: Battlecry
Actually Irish_Pony, it had two that I know of
wait a second.. is that a Sumica maid?
0,14there was another game for GBA and for Xbox
flutter_spin: yes
SolairePony89: With all the products they sell, it'd be possible to humiliate them...
SolairePony89: BANZAI
heh
Sumica: Well Mt. Fugi is like a god to them, and japan is very religous so...ya...:P
Err..I mean...TYPES of products.
MahBoi777: KATANAAAAAA!
lol
2,14 Battlecry was also on the PS2
xD
2,14 and it was amazing
awesome Sumica maid..
WindWhistler: I honestly dont think they care enough to be humilated
It was also on the Gamecube, if that hasn't been mentioned
00,10not realy a maid if you look at the pic wrek did
Also, there was Robotech:Invasion on the PS2
lol.
Looks more like a metalhead poni

Tovler: I agree with the English language.

I vote for Ghost in the Shell
German always sounds like someone is yelling angrily at you
CriticKitten: im watching him now~

I vote for ponieez/
/me gets all the mares.

/me gets all the welcomes
How is that GabeMoist ?

Lucid[M]: sarcasm

Lolololl.

Its annoying how every Japanese word has a different meaning.

Lucid[M], if you can't tell just by looking at it, then you will never undertsnad
XXXXXXXXXXDDDDDDDDDDD
The cat speaks?!
yeahhhh
Just like Luna from Sailor Moon :P

Actually, it is Japanese, so nevermind
ofc the cat speaks its anime

What I want to know is how many ponies here can create sprites...
Colbert watch out! Drone!
It SEEMS easy to do, but sounds hard
I'd totally vote for Colbert. >_>
Lucid[M]: If I've learned anything from Japanese writing, it's that you gotta be there from the beginning in order to have even the slightest chance to figure out what's going on
Colbert 2012? we came close XD
Have him do the show every night out of the Oval Office.
heh, reminds me of the fanfic of Colbert being thrown into Equestria
Dat ant crossing.
Twilight Sparkle 2012
Nah bro, Luna 2012
Oil Spill all over again!
CriticKitten: He almost won the Republican nomination (or at least beat Ron)
And that is how equestria was created/
and that's how she became a ballerina
Like a boss.

Lucid[M]: you can get coffee in a can here in the US, too.

So...why do all of the robots have products on them? 6_9
And they just use the actual product name!?
WindWhistler Free advertising!
And like the primary sponsor was like Pomegrantite Juice
0,14all right, for those who aren't too familiar with Tiger and Bunny, it's essentially what if superheroes were around and were sponsoered
WHAT IS THIS WORLD COMING TO?!
I thought WacDonalds was clever.
00,10Some one has to pay for all the proptery damage heros cause
FlareChaser you have the brony community to hang out with :)
Yeah, they can't all be Bruce Wayne XD
But don't they usually create fake companies?
BUNNY?
Flutter_Riff in truth, no one can
True...
Biglaw: Yes, but the Brony community isn't very exciting in my opinion.
00,10some are fake
00,10I think
FlareChaser well, why not hang out with some friends?
cue the woman
Irish_Pony: D'AWWWWWWWWWWW

CIRCLE BIRDS!
Where Othello spies on Cassio and Iago
Circle birds

yaaaaaaaaah
call upon the sky vultures, when you're in distress
BIRDS
that's a good scene
sokka "oh look a AC-130 o w8 just some birds "
and this kids is why you dont do drugs
hold hands?
Iago has his little "Now will I question Cassio of Bianca / He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain from the excess of laughter"
CIRCLE BIRDS= bufferring?
monologue thing
owlicious: Helpful as can be vultures, simply signal CAAAAAW
flutter_spin: and tails
Sokka is best druggy
yeah it's good
NOT THE BEES AHHHHHHHHHHH
:D
Sokka is best non bender
00,10lawl sakka
but it's hard cus' you have to coordinate actions etc. for Cassio and Iago while Othello talks in the middle of it
rawr
and it's infinitely awkward
MahBoi777: the circle birds where doing the play version of the buffershow
0,14XD

XXXXXXXXXXDDDDDDDD
Oright

Well I suck at acting
Petrified_Discord: shhh wit your logic
but oh well

the sad thing is that Cassio and Iago do a lot of manly stuff in this scene
0,14I'm expecting him to say "ONE MORE THING" every other line
DeathStar: hai sis how was school
hah
masculine gestures and all that
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: alright
The White Lotus were much cooler in this series
lol Zuko
especially when Cassio mocks Bianca
that old guy sounds like amon =/
SaxyPretender: /) for having watched that series.
Also we coordinated this really really rude gesture in the middle of it XD

WindWhistler: It's probably the most logical choice, since they don't have a firebender with them. High-pressure water is used very often to cut metals.
Water is a primary force of erosion...

hi Chrysalis
*Licks cake of off face Pinkie Pie style* SO GOOD!
how is everyone today?
Phase4: maybe 632m/s in the wrong direction?
good
04BronyState chat, I would like to ask a question to you guys
What?
00,02ohai Ghosties
?
Ohai Chrysalis good thank you
?
: ( Don't worry phase, geosync is overrated anyway.
ohai Phase4 listeining to Miracle of Sound
00,02diddutz, its the right direction
i'm all ears
yes Ghosties?
04Do you think getting Soul Calibur IV for the PS3 was a good idea?
was getting a PS3 a good idea?
/me has never even heard of that game
04Yes
Is this bad?
Ghosties im afriad i have never played it, what has caused the doubt?
04But that's not the question
Wow, Ive just heard of this band, and they are already one of my favorite bands
it is for me
And also, evening Ghosties.
04I'm not asking about my PS3
CupcakeWarrior they do some really good songs
04:I
why do u ask Ghosties di u not enjoy it as much?
I don have a PS3 nor have I heard of Soul Caliber :S
did*
now getting it for a 360 might have been okay
04@Chrysalis: I've heard fighting gamers say it's not as good as SCV
soul cailber wait like those arcade ones but ps3 verstion?
360 pffffft
BRB
PS3>360
lolz
come on guys dont start the ps3/xbox argument
04^
its just gonna end with PC winning anyway
lol
04Now, wait just a minute...
I haven't played a console in over a year anyway
04Oh, Cupcake, what band were you talking about just now?
00,02:<
00,02kerbim has 6 hour days
00,02:<
00,02time to change my orbit
Ghosties: The band playing the music on the stream
BACK :p
04What's the band o_o
i like this persons tastew!
taste*
I get my gaming on PC pretty much exclusively now
Ghosties: Miracle of Sound, I believe
Ghosties this is miracle of sound, the current song is "dead dont shuffle, they run"
*Yawns*
04Ah
04Thanks
all there music is game inspired
04Oh, and I also picked up Virtua Fighter 5 for PS3 two days ago
Ponies47: bless you :3
Chrysalis: What game is this from then?
thanks fort the band name!
04Unlike Soul Calibur IV I do not doubt Virtua Fighter's depth

Phase4: What are you trying to do here?
Yep. It was great
DeadpoolDash: theres a stream on
thats why I asked
00,02CupcakeWarrior, see if it was realy in geosync orbit
00,02its drifting VERY slowly
00,02so :3
Oh boy do I remember him
do I ever
cough cough
it's almost like my throat is raspy from some sort of fire injury
LOL
yea
cough mine too cough cough
i was like OMFG OMG OMG when i heard his voice
i was shits gonna get real now
is it who i think it is O.O
Yea, I don't quite know where they're going to go with it
damn embed link, I meant to use this http://youtu.be/dcNfKLQQ1vE
theres obviously a massive fucking fight
lol
mario_pony: shhh
:O
00,02dont think i can get this too land
Phase4: don't worry, no kerbal left behind is the marines saying, not the space program
this is gonna sound oddly specific, but does anyone know a program that will record an audio feed but only while a button is held?
internet crapped for Phase4 again
Audio feed as in mic in? or audio feed as in desktop sounds?
dat Mistress_Molestia
0.0
Mistress_Molestia: where?
basically a mic in
Here
00,02interderped
/me hugs Mistress_Molestia
00,02stream should fix itself
derpy gets all of us all of the time
without just recording the entire audio stream, cause my keyboard is really loud
Basically google for audio recording with push to talk feature in it.
what do ya guys think a young Draconequus would look like? kind of a pony like shape or what?
and Phase4: don't worry about it. No kerbal left behind is the marines saying, not the space program. :P
hello everyone
ded
Hi OneTrickPony
Chrysalis: off the top of my head (and google) I don't know of any well know ones. You might be able to use audacity and clip off or dampen the keyboard sounds.
hey OneTrickPony hows it goin?
Hello OneTrickPony
o hey
Hello OneTrickPony
Chrysalis: here is the link to the current version: http://audacity.sourceforge.net/
If you want to check it out and see if it will work
for those of you who havnt played this, i recommend it http://www.comdotgame.com/play/rainbow-dash-attack
Audacity is good for being able to remove certain sounds. I was able to even get rid of the sound of background airflow using it before.
does anyone know if it would be worth getting a synth for producing music?
Carpathia: yes! I did not know this existed
00,02had to do stuff
but as the games go on for an hour
trimming all that audio would be a nightmare
trim all the audio :$
hmmm....:S hows does an idea of a wandering pony helping saved Equestria,but at a STEEP price and redeeming himself and regaining that which he lost as a story?
00,02still in geosync orbit :3
00,02has drifted slightly to the right, if this were a real satelite it'd have stationkeeping motors
00,02so
00,02what to do next
00,02nother satelite?
00,02visit a planet?
00,02or blow shit up
No kickbot?
Phase4 try and hit the new sattellite with a rocket
blow shit up
00,02bugger
I just used a short recording of airflow with no other mic input and spread it to the whole video, and it worked. I think you could probably do the same thing with a short audio clip of you typing.
00,02interderps
00,02i'm getting lag
OtakuTom i have a mechanical keyboard, it can be louder than me speaking
spy sappin my stream!
ah
skyrimjob
well im off 2 bed cya everypony :)
is that a tardis module?
00,02Chrysalis, that would be insanely dificult
hey everypony
Phase4 yes, thats why it would be fun to watch
night Sketch_Toku_Brony
Phase4: OMG IT's the tarids

sorry for late reply about audacity, but i use it to remove bgm from mlp episodes so i can get just the voices

Not really how the T.A.R.D.I.S. works, but oh well.
00,02i have no clue how to intercept
00,02well this game has no controls for space-time warping
00,02so its just a rocket with huge power and near infinite fuel
Phase you gonna make deaspace happen up there
:D
You need to be able to land in london and have it's fuel recharge.

IT HILLARIOUS :D
If you want a look, I'll PM
its*
i guess ill look
ah what the hell, send us the link ill have a look
its worse than the lyra one though
Phase4: me likes
i THINK its actually larger than the lyra one...almost full sized
Now I wait for responses.
oh god why :[
omg

I have to get it for Neil.
It would be fucking hilarious if his dad found it
wait till hes in call
Alright
i wanna hear the reaction to that

I'll remove the link from the skype group then
o.o
ah no wonder i didnt get it by that then
It will let me savour everyones responses later
hey Phase4 any word on if we will be getting an aj emote anytime? :)

maybe you should warn people first DashWithRainbows :D
Oh man... When that plushie came up on my Tumblr dash, I almost cried from laughter
Oh dear.... thats a little disturbing. O_o
FairysHuff: You are not serious
Oh
Derb There isn't much too it. They have the option to click the link AND I tell them that it is similar to the Lyra plushie
They know what they're getting into
http://vocaroo.com/i/s0ppWiMiCUIj
Besides, it's funny as hell.
DashWithRainbows its not similar to they lyra plushie
thats true
its wrong as hell
i think its worse
Uhhh, yes it is.
It's the same purpose
its far far worse
as a coin purse
I wish I hadn't seen that O_o
Could've been worse
It could have been used
ok, this one is more than just a "pocket" though
that thing needs a bigger NSFW sticker than a porn site

I want it
so friggin' much
:o
You want that plushie?
No
I want it to... minus the obvious part >_>
I want to witness otarage once more
oh yeah, minus that bit, that plushie is amazing
Oh boy, this game...what is this game?
it's the best entertainment you can have in a skype call
Chrysalis: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0ppWiMiCUIj
DashWithRainbows you should hear him on XBLX
I would use that plushie as an iPod carrier
And it would be awesome
Yeh. Despite it's disturbing nature it seems well made and large. I like large cuddly plushies
Chrysalis Meh, I would piss him off. I troll like mad on xbox
I'd attach a strap to it and carry it everywhere
man i would love a lifesize luna plushie
Chrysalis: me vista
AUTOCORRECT
I want a life size Lyra plushie
just for great big hugs
me gusta*
I think the only way we're going to get any MLP plushies is by making them ourselves. ~_~
I want a giant Tom plushie

Phase4: Trust me, it's good!

00,02BroKnee, yeah
I'mah get on
Phase4: BUT WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
[B]JRP2234 Because he's streaming
it's his choice
That disturbing plushie that was shown has made me think of something even more disturbing.
00,02is that vocaroo link ok?
Phase4: If you call JRP singin Friday really fast, then yes.
A futa MLP plushie O_o With batteries
FairysHuff: Oh god why
Futa? Where?

DashWithRainbows ^
Because she is jailbait trap
i remember octofuta fake page from terraria wiki

/me actually enjoys futa
Neil*
heh, remember that futashy sketch from wrek?
XAX Neil is Scootachicken
Ah.

Chrysalis: .____. when was this.
I like futa as well. But I wouldn't want an MLP plushie of one. O_o
YAY!
Phase4: i promis is not yelling
XAX it was a while ago, he did a sort of requests part of stream, and it was basically a load of shipping
Monday Fight Club!
I don't bother with usernames people from the skype group have here, only if it's quick to type
including otakon and futashy
Or what's it called
Like Nyria and Neil.
Fun game! I prefer this over TF2 anyday :P
I would like to see one, because that would be pretty funny to me
Chrysalis: And he drew fluttershy with a dick?
Lol.
Vordox this is Super Monday Night Combat
Im back
Chrysalis: Yep :P

Hello again Mistress_Molestia

FairysHuff: would it be a unicorn :P
LOL! ^_^

XAX linked

And yes. It would be like a sex toy
this reminded me of tf2 somehow
00,02i'm confused
k thank you Chrysalis for telling me
It would need to be easy to clean though. It would see a lot of use.
really can i see?
ok guys, that is WAY too in depth a convo for the chat
Phase4: that looks like a furture version on teamfortress or like on crack version
Chrysalis: That is true. *Bows in defference*
Phase4: tf2 time
tis fine, just try to keep is SafeForWoona
00,02yeah
00,02this is a little different
Chrysalis: give me a line to read
00,02cow, its like tf2 if tf2 were a gameshow

FairysHuff: :|
Phase4: so this game is a game show basically were you kill people for the game of it? that is wierd
Phase4: can i play with you on tf2?

Anyone else looking forward to the X-COM remake?
00,02unreal tournourment is suposed to be a gameshow in-universe

BroKnee: how many minutes left?

/me Luna y u so OP

What do you mean, your first PC?
The one I have now was like $2000 dollars
My first computer
<Kammerjunk>I pity the fool with less than 1 MB download. <--- I am not a fool
The first one my dad bought me
Im not at my house right now, but when I am, I never see more than 120 KB/s download speed
the fastest my internet ever goes is 350 KB/s
CupcakeWarrior O.o Really?
:<
http://derpy.me/CueMg #shpwingoffalittle
Jeez
Yeah, and correct me if I'm wrong, but your download speed should be limited by your what kind of bandwidth you pay for instead of your computer's card (Unless it's really bad)

If my parents would let me I would buy you guys Exactly what I have O.o
Meh. My family pays for 50 Mbit download and upload. I'd settle for 10.

Eeyup. I'd try to explain what I mean, but I don't think gymnasiums are anywhere but Denmark.
We are such a hipster nation.
Chrysalis: ahh but ya need to be skilled still
Kammerjunk I thikn Denmark and NZ to=ied for the peace index?
*tied
I have no clue, to be honest.
The education system here is 10 years of one school, then 3 years of another, then whatever you choose.
Wait, Princess Luna is playing as Celestia?
I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall.

"According to Raymond Kurzweil, by 2029 the kind of computer power it'll take to equal a human brain will cost about $1. You could paint them on your walls." IDEA!
Does anypony have a working time machine just lying around? I'm too impatient to wait 17 years + I'll be old by then
ill be 32 xD
Well, time is relative. All you'll need to do is move at the speed of light.
I can legally go 85 on the highway, but my Jeep is not capaple of light speed travel
CrazyCherry: what toe? You're a pony! :D
Oh. What a shame.
MadSurge: Ok I hit my hoof, I HAVE SO MUCH PAIN RIGHT NOW.
CrazyCherry: pardon but a hoof is hard as hell please tell me how that works that it hurts?
NASA won't loan me a spare rocket - I'm good for a few hundred billion...it'll just take a few million years to work off the bill

I'm gunna get off here at 8.. wait, will this site play live episodes?
Reikim: Oh yeah I remember that...
Reikim how'd it do that
6_9
00,10twice realy if you count poorly planed zombie event
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRbsISDS8kk
alexxm: There was a bug that would hop from player to player when they interacted. Predictably, it spread like wildfire in area with high player concentration, i.e. cities.
i just watched a pony mareathon yesterday to celebrate the sun celebration
danishbrony: that video is like heavan
Reikim was it anything to do with the undead classes?
yeah i love it XD

Sumica: it was a fun event, though. I took part in it. I even got to play out a mock-drama moment when I had to kill my guild leader XD
Sylandest: Oh god that must have been hilarious.
wuuu
00,10the event started off well till human nature came in to account and they used it to troll low levels and hide in santuary zones where they could not be attaced but could still infect

SMILE MSILE SMILE is the best mlp fim song EVER
night firelight
00,10Chrysalis, wow during the lich king launch event
Im probablly the only one that thinks this, but BBBFF was my favorite MLP song :$
Sumica: I miss lich king...that was my expansion of enjoyment. I had not one single complaint for the entire expansion
My personal favourite song from FiM is Winter Wrap-Up, followed closely by the Flim-Flam song.
CCCP: It's good like so many others
:) yup
Ah, i only joined just after lich
Reikim: thank you. thsoe songs are great. my faves are.... Smile smile smile. Winter wrap up, may the best pet win. and at the galla
smile smile smile is 2nd
I actually didn't like the Gala song :P
that much
oh good god what was i thinking, just looking at some of my old (6yrs) code, and it is horrific
Reikim: oooh. and bbbff and love is in bloom
aaaaghhh
00,10funpart was the event just before it where I got geared out in items that let me do 200% more damage to the undead.
BUCK YEAH
Mica nice one all the dps
why does this game have windwipers that can turn on
Bronysith: you like BBBFF too?
Sumica: oh yeah, I remember that...I tried to go after the gear, but then I gave up and went back to questing, lol
danishbrony: Why do i get the feeling your danish? :D
Chrysalis: I can one-up that with some of my art from...hm...seven to eight years ago? Absolutely revolting stuff.
CCCP: it is far superior to this day aria in every way
:D Dat theme
Bronysith: that i agree with /)
what game is this
Garbage Car Simulator 2012?
Physics!
Bronysith: Chill, man. Let's not start a flame war. Love and Tolerance, and all that.
Reikim i feel physically repulsed by it, and have to clean it up for fear of someone seeing it on my drive
haha where are you from killerpony7733?
SirGanjalf actually... i think thats correct...
Best kind of physics
00,10the hell
what is this i dont even
Chrysalis: Delete it. Delete it ALL.

alexxm: i am considering that possibility
DISCORD
00,02Bronysith, yeah
That truck is a Transformer. It's the only logical explanation.
where are you from killerpony7733?
Chrysalis: That is indeed a valid alternative option.
Phase4: are we all on acid?
danishbrony: take one educated guess, if i know what danish means then you would know easily :P

CCCP: And then it ate her, and there was much rejoicing.

/me slaps Chrysalis with a cinderblocj.
Why is Trixie so awesome?
meanwhile keep it sfw, we dont want to know bout you eatin trixie
A curse on my inability to aim at the right letter.
Goddamnit Unfound.
this is what ill do if i see a mclaren http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/669/
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCjyiEOZP44
CCCP: Cause she's not
She's not
CCCP: SHE SUCKS PLOT
Because Meanwhile loves her :P
BUCK TRIXIE
Videofreak1127[M]: D:
CCCP because shes a pony, all ponies are awesome
|Discord|: LIES
Shaddup Irish_Pony.
also, meanwhile loves trixie
And shaddup Chrysalis.
Chrysalis: This is true
CCCP: SHE WAS A BITCH TO APPLEJACK.
he loves her so much hes embarrassed about it
AND shaddup CCCP.
so he hides behind an aggressive facade
Stop shipping me with Trixie!
Meanwhile: I should do that
Meanwhile oh but i thought you like had a thing for Trixe ;)
but we know, that behind that facade, is the beating heart of a man in love, in love with trixie
I saw a picture that made me feel sorry for Trixie
CCCP: but... trixie is best sham :)
why can't everyone just shut up about this
WindWhistler: same here
I hate you guys sometimes.
Unfortunately, I can't remember where I found it.
|Discord|: but shes TheGreatandPowerfulTrixie!
Meanwhile: oh come on the way you can tell something is really good is when a british guy with a sexy moustache loves it :3
Panda: Give me yo money :[
lol
Well, actually, I know where I found it, but the thread is probably long gone by now.
The reason I do not discord trixie is because she seems to be doing fine on her own.
/me gives Om all his bits
CCCP: That's why she's not awesome
/me sashays of
off
CCCP: If she was humble, then I'll be able to stand her
Om: btw, my ballances is 0 :)
I will never feel sorry for Trixie because canonical she's a horrible person.
/me realizes he is awesome. He forgot
why dont you try seating her Videofreak1127[M]?
Panda: So is mine :)
One fanfic about Trixie made my opinion about her make a 180° turn. Fanon-wise, anyway.
Chrysalis: Practice what you preach
Canon, she's still a bitch.
Videofreak1127[M]: but she IS awsome!!!!!! her character is much more deep than you would think
Videofreak1127[M] i like all ponies
Panda: Good mornin to you by the way
u know what i love
Ponies?
Trixie > Luna >:3
thegt90 Mmmmmmbananads
I can ignore Trixie's fanon interpretations because frankly they are irrelevant.
yes and pony cars
CCCP but Luna is best pony, your math is wrong
Luna = worst pony
CCCP: She was in one episode, 2 if you count Queen Chrysalis. Faust wrote her so that kids would learn humility because no one can stand her boasting
JK! :D
No! The true best pony is....ALL OF US!
Wait one second...Trixie had some of the same powers as Twilight Sparkle...could Trixie be Twilights aunt trying to get revenge on her sisters daughter?
CCCP: YOU'RE HEAD SHALL BE ON A SILVER PLATTER!!!!
OMG CANNON\
Videofreak1127[M]: shes still a good character
Fluttershy's my favorite, but I killed her in a fic I'm writing. Go figure.
CCCP you were lucky you recinded that
Irish_Pony: awwww
i was planning a lynching
http://chzgifs.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/funny-gifs-while-on-a-diet.gif
Chrysalis: :P
but to be honest i never understood why people like Luna soo much
Om: good morning to you too ^^
derpy_pony: :D
derpy_pony: Is that nutela?
yep
CCCP: I just don't like her. I wanted to punch her in the face so bad when I watched that episode
yea
A NUTELA AND BACON SANDWHICH
but then I'd break my computer
Time to get ready for my gradutation everypony, ill bbl!! :)
SOUND GOOD ANYPONY?
Videofreak1127[M]: wow, the only character i everf wanted to punch in the face was Gilda
bye RaveBrony

CCCP: I wanted to punch Gilda too
oh bai RaveBrony
|Discord| make it happen
alexxm: I WILL

Videofreak1127[M]: lol
Trixie is just a show-off. Now Gilda is somepo... somegriffon I'd like to punch repeatedly.
by RaveBrony
hey BrOnyxia some people argueing about trixie again
Bye RaveBrony
Cya, RaveBrony :)
CCCP: I find that I wanted to punnch a lot of the antagonists, like the parasprites
alexxm: ;o
damn my connection lags a lot, i think i need to be off now
I hate show-offs.
Later, valoreins
When gilda yelled at Fluttershy...I cried and promissed to get revenge on her, DISCORD vs GILDA, battle of the assholes
Videofreak1127[M]: aww i like parasprites
bye valoreins
CCCP: They're cute, cuddly, balls of DEATH
And I return
What are cute balls of death?
Videofreak1127[M]: lol
Videofreak1127[M]: I made them
hey Nebula-Grey hows your day been
Nebula-Grey: parasprites
Kirby is a cute ball of death
He's a black hole with feet
That does not surprise me, Discord
alexxm: idk.. dun rly like her tho but wouldnt care if someone has a different opinion
the death star is a cute ball of death
I made everything in the everfree forest
Well Kirby is a psyhcopath, so cute ball of death describes him pretty well.
How do you type the lines like in Discord's name? I'm a bit of a noob at this.:'(
I just learned an interesting fact: The guy who played the candle in Beuty and the Beast is in Law and Order :P
Get back in your stone prison
BrOnyxia i'm just staying out of the arguement
Videofreak1127[M]: azerty or qwerty?
NO I AM FREE AND BUCK YOU
CountDoofus: qwerty
BUT RP IS NOT ALLOWED
they had a role for a candle...
alexxm: kno... pointless argument if u want my opinion :P
Also says on the news on my comp a felon bit a police dog
Ah, can't help you there. I'm using azerty. Sorry :|

00,10to quote wrek, Colts are hard to draw
G.I. JOOOEEEE!!!!!!
BONK

ouch
alexxm: Tiring. All the meds I took over the past few days hit me at once. Lots of muscle weakness
I just wish I didnt find Sumica's oc to be sort of sexy
FairysHuff: Miko Outfit?
Also because Sumica looked sexier with a thong
NUDE
Makes me feel dirty
>.>
Pretty sure that was a factor in the R63 too, Sumi
how come you're taking meds FairysHuff
VDXRetrotainment: Japanese shinto buddhist preistess
FairysHuff: Ah, Reimu desu
00,10so you are saying you dont want to see the orginal drawing that the desktop pony is based on then Acid-Ace?
VDXRetrotainment: Hai
Sumica: i wanna see :)
Hello all.
may i ask what gender Sumica is?
Sumica: I've seen it
FairysHuff: It's kawai neee :)
Damn, it's hot out.
I have a thing for Mikos.
hey Randomnerd
And it still bothers me how I find it sexy
Lets have a siriou-NAKED PERSON-s moment.
hey Randomnerd hows your day been
Sumica ooh that would be cool
token black character in the opening credits
Acid-Ace you should see SB64's OC. =P
though its annoying to find a decent gif editor
lol indeed
alexxm: It's been okay.
00,10lets see if I can pull up a link
Chrysalis: Jasc Animation Shop, or ULEAD
SuperBrony64: I actually havent seen your OC, may I?
Oh, God, Okinawa. I forget it's actually such a nice place to live
I would like to stay and watch FMP but I hate the main female char. She gets on my nerves.
VDXRetrotainment either of those free?
suddenly white hair is hot
Chrysalis: Nope, but you can still aqquire them... :P
sovieta?
Sumica: what gender are you?
FairysHuff: Maybe she is supposed to?

Dark_Horst: Soooomewheeere over the rainbooow.
TELETHA TESTAROSSA. <3
Sumica: wait... I thought you said some other OC, ive seen yours ^^
Sumica yeah, but once wrek draws you female, you become it
yep, she got into the military....suuuuuuuure
lol
Dark_Horst: She's whispered.
FairysHuff: I'm sure that is the point >_> <_< probably not though...
00,10well seeing as every one stuck with that.
VDXRetrotainment: i have absolutely no idea what that means
Dark_Horst: Lots of militaries have conscription.
Sumica. You know what...what would SuperBrony64's OC be? XD
