What kind of retarded IRC rule is this Wrek
>retarded
<.<
Are you implying that spamming isn't retarded?
in o i want 2 use color lol
05Its really simple. it distinguishes mods from the regular folks
Derpy: Retared how? I like being able to tell the mods apart from the regular people.
Plus, color spam.
08,01because we're better than you
What the hell is that weird noise.
I hear a weird whooshing sound over and over.
seems easy
bad ass momma
08,01but seriously, it's mostly because we get high traffic volume during BMN and episodes
guys stop confusing can normal users use colors as well or what what the heck!
BroHoof: No
Bold allowed?
Lolno.
08,01so announcements are easier if people can actually see us
Gold_Demona, oh alright
>colors
Derpy Thing is nothing that makes you highlighted over any other users when you aren't a mod is not allowed
>kick for using bold, colors? nope
Simple as that

Hello Major
Hiyo Major
count flapular CX
<BroHoof> Derpy, how the hell did you do that ._. -err, i just used colors? implying everybody's using some kind of webclient
08,01Kecleondarihu: wikipedia says that it is a "word for a system of racial segregation enforced through legislation by the National Party governments"
XD
ha
Derpy: A lot of people in this chat are on the website, which doesn't have the option for colors.
thought so
haha
lolol
that took some time XD
Derpy, well yea but... you are a normal user right? then...uhh im confused ._.
...
LOL
BroHoof, I don't use webclients for IRC
BroHoof: Derpy immediately got autokicked when colors were used.
>mIRC
BroHoof: You're not understanding, are you?
Spell-of-Gaming, no no i got it now
XD
Ooohh! He has Technoviking abs now.
Gold_Demona, LightIRC can do colors, but we all know the consequenses for non-mods using it.
Kecleondarihu: I know that. I'm trying to explain it to BroHoof
what a idiot
/me facepalms

05mmm this avocado is delish
potato chip ice cream?
Don't bother counting it, just weight it.
Wrek: Avocado is pretty much win
I need to get some more pretzels
Wrek: my sister loves avocado
omnomnom pepernoten
Potato chip ice cream?
I'd eat it!
MY EYES
What flavor potato chip...?
Potato chip ice cream?
I just had a chicken club, probably the only thing I like from McDonalds
Are you serious?
Wow. That's a world-class gut, there.
Jonny fat
You're going to put salt in your ice cream?

Oh... wait.

How nice.
Coke + milk = weird
Ew
I want to try seasalt icecream :3
I'd drink it!
oni_link: same
MURIKA!
Its the original Mr. Krabs!
>Seasalt Icecream
Lolno.
I want it to be a fictional food and that's it.
oni_link: the guy who made kingdom hearts 2 enjoyed seasalt ice cream enough to make it a kepart of the game
O_O
wtf?
NOW he has techno viking abs.
Bronysith: wow
have you guys ever made icecream with liquid nytrogen?
um wow
what the fuck
BEN: hell yea

um...wut?

Have you made ice cream out of oxygen?
It tastes milk-ish but it's aerated ofc :)
Too Many Johnnys!
I made coconut milk icecream.
This is why the 90's were the best
yep
meh...
Animaniacs is better
P0N-3: I love coconut icecream
Me too! It's sooo good.
old cartoon network was better
^
NO SHIT
NO FCUKING SHIT
lol XD
P0N-3: <3
:D
i want some now
though the Hub is bringing animaniacs back
I was sad to see Care Bears is going on the hub.
Bronysith: They are?
omnomnom coconut icecream 
Major: you honestly didnt know that?
WHAT, i didn't do anything
maybe i should get some cookie dough
Bronysith: dont have the Hub channel
:P
same
cool hair XD
I don't have the hub because I live in Canada.
I don't have Hub either
Curse you Canada!
We don't even have Netflix.
Derpy, indeed you didn't. His kick script false positives like that every now and then
Major: D:
But it's rare
Animaniacs, and Batman the animated series are the two best cartoons ever
Major: You poor poor thing. :<
05only false positives if you've used colors once
Hey guys
Hi everybody :)
hi
Derpy: who doesnt?
Too Many Johnnys!
Oh, this is the revived series. I didn't like this as much as the original version.
Hey has anyone noticed MLP has a thing with clones? I think they're just trying to explain away the background doubles.
First the changelings, now a magic pond.
I just cant wait till tomorrow because the day after we can finally start celebrating the best holidy ever
P0N-3: maybe
Major, some people already have.
LOL Poor Johnny XD
O_O
Wrek, Sumica didnt even distinguish colours, bold and italic
05bold and italic use the same code types
05script detects them
05and frankly for the best
anyone else remember Medabots?
05besides once youve used them only then does the fasle positives occur
Back into the mirrow pond with ye, Johnny clones!
mirror*
Bronysith: I do
oni_link: yay
Bronysith: those things were cool
yay
Bronysith: I remember I wanted a medabot. :>
Yay! A classic cartoon!
Gold_Demona: who wouldnt want a personal robotic companion?
oh wow we goin old school
YUSH

Spell-of-Gaming: Only in Red/Blue is that true

Spell-of-Gaming: From Gold/Silver onward Charizard can learn Fly
Megas XLR is pure win as well

WOW
My country's Cartoon Network still plays these episodes from time to time. :3

Since it wasn't actually a "series' per se
this is truly one of the few who has transcended the generations
05actualöly yeah
055 shorts a year
For hand drawn animation that's impressive
Gold_Demona: how can i stop my rage on myself? ;_;
yep mad
MadSurge: What do you mean "for hand drawn animation"?
05this episode is one giant piano piece for isntance
aniderp: wat? y u mad and :o
Gold_Demona: not using computers/flash :D

Cool.
Gold_Demona: kinda, yes... am I being dumb?
Could we stream some Eddsworld after this maybe?
aniderp: have you told her to put it back after?

MadSurge: The impresiveness should be the other way around. When Flash animation can actually look good. >.>

aniderp: why?
Gold_Demona: that too
05srsly

Chrysalis: all I'm saying is: excellent pun :D
i had the wierdest moment at work
a) i was annoyed i had to wash my hands at work before i could eat lunch
b) i was kinda amused that it was because dealing with £1000 in coins is messy
Oooh liking the Pon3 there wrek

05so far no luck
your music collection is awsome so far

05aaaand nope it couldnt
05*sigh*
05screw this
05lets raubtier
08,01 i really want to include the phrase "colloqually known as 'the arse end of Fife'" in my report...
08,01because that's where i was teaching, basically
08,01pretty much bottom rung
05you havent commented vinyl yet

05if you can
08,01Chrysalis: i am
08,01i'm writing a report
oooh this is why i want to watch stream on phone
Wrek: Could you get one of those scripts that posts to IRC what's playing? In your case it would actually be useful. :)
so wrek can be the dj to my life
and it would be fantastic
05or i can do this...
08,01oh wow, nice wrek!
08,01i love the socks!
08,01and i *LOVE* the choker!
08,01my god, chokers...

Chockers like that need a little bell though
08,01Chrysalis: hehehehe
or a pendant
/me 08,01has a hting for chokers, if you couldn't guess
maybe a treble/bass cleff on the choker Wrek?
08,01i'm gonna make Chrysalis wear a choker with a bell for BUCK
AWWW YEAHHH GOOD MORNING PONYVILLE
I got my girlfriend into wearing one, best decision ever
08,01i once had a girlfriend who was utterly obsessed with cows
08,01really obsessed
08,01everything in our flat was cowprint
MOOO
05now this is good shit BEN ;)
08,01so i got her this cowprint bra and panty set
Nice
Goddamn home network randomly disconnecting my phone and shit
08,01i didn't realise that it came with a choker with a little bell
:D
08,01she wore it, came out, and i pretty much fucking pounced on her
Swedish metal is just awsome:P
understandable
08,01i'm ashamed to say that my ex in cowprint getup was one of the hottest things i've ever seen in my life
Literal cowgirl! :$
08,01lots of sex was had that night
08,01lots.
Awesome :D
iv got my current/previous girlfriends to do MUCH worse
08,01oh, if we're talking about *worst* things we've got partners to do...
08,01i have a list.
lol
08,01nevaaar!
08,01but yeah, we can continue this in THE OTHER CHANNEL
oooh basscleff pendant <3
lol
08,01wink wink
other channel?
08,01nudge nudge
"Let the napalm rain"? What a title!
that channel scares me
i have no clue what that could be
08,01oh my fucking cod, wrek
Ohai
euch, my old chemistry teacher used to call me napalm
08,01that is just TOO CUTE
08,01Chrysalis: because you're flaming and sticky?
/me 08,01falls off his chair laughing
well it was close to my real name
annoyingly
it stuck
hey-oooo!
and every science teacher since then that has taught me
has called me napalm
i only made thermite in class ONCE
08,01i'm gonna go with my expanation, hun
but she made it a challenge
08,01also, because we have 2 Nathans on staff at BUCK...
08,01oh yeah, you guessed it.
and this is our floor manager
napalm
i umm... i made toxic fumes out of lead and some other stuff. it was a heating reaction.
we dont need no floor
and i kinda melted the glass tube... and the floor.
and yeah.
Rose`Garden we caused the science dept to evacuate after "accidentally" making noxious ammounts of chlorine in the air
:D
i want to go to your class
serriously, bad behaviour + top set = BAD THINGS
smart enough to know how to really screw things up
and unfortunately, we worked togetehr
Chrysalis: I know that feeling
08,01wrek, can i has your babies?
Wrek thats almost criminally cute
hey, that looks like the collar i bought my sl...
nvm.
cause i sure am
08,01i am
08,01anyhoos, back to work
work is boring
do what i did
took the afternoon off
seriously, an afternoon on a thursday does WONDERS
wait ive heard the song some where before
08,01urgh
08,01what's a tactful way of saying "an area that is rough, poor, and shitty"?
Stream ded?
rustic
08,01well, i'm looking more for a phrase than a word
Stream is ded to me :c
*for me
HavokOC: try refreshing
No, wait
Works now
:D
an area of social decline
08,01"Kirklands High School is based in Methil, and area that is rough, poor, and shitty." <-- this is what i currently have
08,01Chrysalis: thank you!
;)
08,01"Kirklands High School is based in Methil, an area of Fife where the population are not generally well-off, and may be considered to be in social decline."
an area with little developmental appeal , except maybe for organized crime
good pye paycheck
08,01i think well-off might be too colloquial...
are generally considered below the poverty line?
Sylandest you mean the world atm
need to show they are affected more than most
could be conciderd aslum
Chrysalis: Ahh, fair point
This song is sooo wtf >.>
08,01"Kirklands High School is based in Methil, an area of Fife where a lot of the population are near the poverty line, which may be considered to be in social decline." <-- nailed it
half of that was written by me!
08,01heh, aye
08,01<3
08,01you're a useful tool, Chrysalis
:O
ooh wrek has expanded the megametalist

yellow quiet is the greatest horse
05no talk about unaired eps
05at all in here
!rules
05but i wont
Wrek: why....? i didn't do anything.......i quoted Rarity from the ''pONYville Confidential episode
aaw
05this is your only
05warning
Someone should add !rules to tom
05same goes for you Zompony
Wrek: again, i quoted Rarity from a previous ep
05i dont give a fuck
05its still relevant to the plot of the next EP
Ok, ok.........:(
Kk wont happen again
05good
05you are both in luck casue thats already been spoild for me
05had it not
Wrek going badass in here
SPOILERS TWILIGHT SPARKLE IS A PONY
05BEN: those count
Shit gets real when you see a lot of red during a Wrekart stream .-.
Wrek: i bet it isn't.......
<BEN> is that username supposed to be a refrence to the BEN Drowned in Majoras Mask Creepypasta?
Yep, that story is amazing
probably
Adam: it's brown
05J_E_Smith71: no talkign about anythign related to unaired eps
since many people here have the originality of a wet bag
jbh1145: I'm gonna look that up now, brb
AssaultWithEmbraces, I mean Wrek's chat colours.
05that includes eventual comics portrayign the plot of said eps
<BEN> yea great story with a scary as hell face
Yeah, but the mask salesman i creepyer than the statue i think XD
<BEN> oh no the statue is WAYYYYYYYYYYYY creepier
Adam: i know. it's brown for me
AssaultWithEmbraces, it is? .-.
Okay maybe Cx
Meh
I'ma go take a look on the new RD Academy
05tail done
Adam: mIRC says its brown
grrr shopping is so depressing
ooh epicmusic as usual
Today is gonna be a double edge sword for me at work, I don't have to go in till Noon, but i wont get off till 11:30 or midnight tonight :(
hey everypony :)
Ohai Sketch_Toku_Brony
hi Sketch
Hey Sketch_Toku_Brony
Okay if the dont know the creepypasta you can read itttttttt here: http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/BEN_(Aka_Haunted_Majora%27s_Mask)
http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/BEN_(Aka_Haunted_Majora%27s_Mask)
Rofl.
XD
dang it cant link it
y cant i link to that website
No non-image links during stream jbh1145
Just google BEN drowned and take the one from creepy pasta wiki
oh
if you want to read the story, its scary bet very good
still haven't read all the way through BEN
im honestly glad the story uses a much less scarier photo instead of that statue
i'll get to it eventually
don't bother
it aint nothin good
I think its good :P
<Buytoast> really?
Buytoast: yeah, usual creepypasta. cracked game, scary stuff, etc.
id say this one is better than some of the stuff ive seen
<XAX> with 2 creepy faces to boot
But the guy who wrote it went to the effort of making an actual hack rom following the details of the story perfectly, and recording it as "evidence".
2 creepy faces!
well slap my ass can call me fran drescher
how utterly terrifying!
just search ben majoras mask on google images
That right XAX way better than some pastas like bound to death, that one is so unoriginal
thats*
This is the best video game creepypasta. no doubt about that
i agree, tails doll aint got shit on Ben XD
i guess if you still sleep with a night light it can be kind of scary
its so creepy i dont ever play zelda majoars mask
the creepy thing is that the guy that made the pasta didnt make the statue, it was in the game
or well he edited it in
but it would appear if you played the elegy of emptiness in the real game
thats one thing that always REALLY creeps me out
?
moving the leg when the picutre is looking so good
yeah when you play the elegy of empitness or something like that
ok i must be off everypony.......see y'all later if i can
05prefered minish cap
bye Dark92Enugma
The pasta i think is worst, might be suicide mouse
Surely he based it on that he knew it was there, BEN?
Bye Dark92Enigma
<@Wrek> but is there a really famous creepypasta about that?i dont think so
>.>
who gives a shit if there's some crappy story about made up spooks
Que?
for tv creepypastas, probably the best are squidwards suicide and its sister story red mist, dead bart, and suicide mouse
and for best non tv non video game pasta it has to be the rake or jeff the killer
<BEN> nupe squidwards sucide is the best tv related one
Hey Everyone..
I think it was good, but the discriptions kinda made me wanna vomit, it was really macabre like russian sleep ekspiriment
Hello Firelight
Oooooh loving the light effects
<BEN> but it is very morbid with those weird poictures that appear for a split second like they say
Yep
hi Wrek
i dont really think smile dog or slenderman is that good, and theyre also kinda overrated
the irony of that statement is overwhelming
Zompony, yes he does.
i was actually going to ask to zom XD
Thx AdamTheDuck :)
08,01who fancies doing some more proof reading for me?

Me likeys, Wrek

Gorgeous Wrek :)
No, don't think so
welp nvm
hell I liked it when it was just Vinyl in socks
Wrek: Could use a textfront at the bottom left corner for a link to your dA profile. And a "made by".
little to the left
Wrek: But nevertheless, it looked amazing.
08,01oh wrek, i do wish you would paint on bigger canvases; i'd totally buy *all* your prints
it's zoomed out you silly scot
05this canvas is 5000x3500 pixels silly
08,01otakon: i know that
08,01Wrek: it is? i swear it looked smalled than that earlier
08,01did he?
Good morning everypony :)
08,01oh!
00,10yeah
08,01right, yes, i remember!
sorry
05haha
xD
Morning BladedWings
05paintool
05ran out of memory
00,10lol
00,10damn wrek
00,10you got as much system memory as I do
Sumica: hi
00,10then again you also maxed out layers again did't you
it looks amazing right now ;w;
00,10Hi wipergone2
Sumica: u ok?
00,10meh
00,10been doing invotory at work so I is in pain
08,01i'm so getting a print of this
Sumica: invotory=inventory?
05yeah
05im max on layers
05backround is only 12 layers
Wrek: For how much?
05vinyl herself is 240ish
08,01can i pay you by sticking notes in various parts of your clothings?
05SafariMonkey: depends on hwo the prints turn out
Wrek: Wait, you ran out of 16 gig?
05this is 100% zoom
geez
so big
I haven't even used 6 gig yet. Then again, I haven't been using painttools and such
08,01oh shit, i'm getting distracted again
Serenity: A visual arts person's work will always expand to fill the RAM it is in.
08,01and i have about 1000 words to write
i haven't even filled 4 gigs with ae & ps
well guess they use swap too
and hdd
I haven't even filled 3 TB with all my crap yet.
SafariMonkey: Ahh okay
I have a 1tb hard drive, used about 200 gig
Mostly games
I have 3 TB total, using around 2.5 TB.
there goes my flashplayer again
Maybe I should wipe them at some point.
05hahahaha
Chrst, I remember when 1tb ExHD's costed 5000 quid in 2006
05memory errors
Oh wow.
How big is this thing?
Serenity: I've used 400GB in my windows half, and who knows how much in my linux half. 2 year old comp. :/
00,10hey wrek, make Mica prints =p
As in size.
huh, my hdd is only 120GB
Serenity: 1TB total
I mean on the disk.
Kammerjunk, 5000x3500 pixels
That is fairly large.
Wrek better save it before memory crash xD
Chrysalis: Until 2 years ago I had a 37GB one.
my 1tb drive is nearly half full
can't wait until 1TB SSDs
How can you people live with so little disk space?
its like blue turd fireworks :O
Jake: Probably about the same
i have most of my data on the externals
whoops 2 tb of course
I use 1 TB for films and TV shows alone, and that's not even on this desktop.
Kammerjunk: Because I don't download films and such
this is so going on my desktop ._.
Kammerjunk i have a PC as a dedicated file server :P
i download films from my tv
05aprox....
Anytime my drive goes over 300 gig used, it's usually used for temperoary files
Fair 'nuff, but still. On this desktop, I use 2.5 TB for Luna knows what.
0516x11 inches maybe?
05had it been on paper
hey Wrek whats the filesize on this thing?
Wrek: Huh, what?
Waaahhh
When is BUCK, anyway?
Dayuuum
Wrek: Will you release PC resolution size ones free?
Kammerjunk: August next year I presume
Alrighty, thanks.
Kammerjunk http://www.buckcon.org/
August 30th to September 1st
05so its roughtly printable on an A3
Like I said, I'm off next year
05if my rough math is correct
NICE
08,0116x11, aye
Hm. I presume this one's full, so I might get tickets for the one after that, if there is to be one.
Wrek: If not, I'd pay.
what dpi will the print have
08,01and A3 is about that
08,01300
/me recently added third TB external
Kammerjunk tickets are not on sale at this moment in time
Goe awaeuy, Sumica stoppit
Chrysalis: To be expected.
08,01Wrek: how big is your sai file in terms of space?
00,10oi I need the space for all the things I stream
Kammerjunk we will announce via twitter etc when they are available
Hmm, true
so follow and see :)
00,10aprocheing 200gigs worth of pony
steam sure uses a lot of my disk space
Heh, my drive is only 200 gig used u
up*
Jake thats why i have a steam only hdd
05let me chech
And it's because of games and such
05its currently using 3gb of mem
Chrysalis: Will do.
00,10primary is 750gm
00,10er gb
05out of the 3gb reserved
05save file itself
Oh wow.
05lets check
Main drive is 500gb, secondary is 500gb
05savign takes eons btw
It runs on RAID
go system count steam
Serenity why raid? go SSD for speed
Jake: Same, including stuff I don't even own (installed from other accounts when they wanted to play their gtame on my comparitively powerful comp)
Chrysalis: Because I can
Also, it came with it
08,01Chrysalis: raided SSD = fastest
00,10Ewww SSD
Games loading off of SSD are so god damn nice
not much faster than normal ssd
Mines SATA
slow FSB :(
08,01Chrysalis: yes it is
Hm. I only have ~77 GB of pony.
Wait, SATA II
00,10SSD does not balence cost to size well
08,01Chrysalis: striping increases parallelism
05here goes
:D Fourze trolled Trollestia http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/286/457/5f7.png
05its 1.142.168Kb
05which is
Sumica you dont get an ssd for the size, you get it for the speed
/me headbangs
05...
I'd get an SSD, but right now I'm more concerned about size than speed.
1GB:O
05help me convert that to gigs
steam= 199GB in 185967 files
051.1 roguhtly yes?
08,01Chrysalis: with RAID5 and enough drives, you will max out your bus speed
Wrek: Kb or KB?
08,01you won't do that with a single drive
05kB*
00,10dont care how fast it is if it's not large enough for many games to even install directly on to
05the file itself
05is
Sumica i run a fiar amount of the games i play on my SSD
051.08GB
08,01Chrysalis: on sata III? don't think so
and keep all the backups on my HDD
08,01i've not kept right up to date, though
00,10yeah as i said I care more for storage then speed
kB? OK, then yeah 1.142GB
00,10having to truffle shuffle files around just so I can load a game faster is silly to me
Wrek: I certainly hope that's the project file and not the image itself.
2 steam installs :) http://screensnapr.com/v/Lt6fRF.jpg
so about 340 GB are filled with games
00,10when the cost to size comes down I till think about geting SSD's
Why would you install Steam twice?
I beleive my drives are 2gb/s
Kammerjunk i have one on my SSD and one on my HDD
Ah.
Wrek: Or if you meant kiB and GiB then 1.089
games load SO damn fast
no loading screens on any games
except PS2
05if i get an SSD for gaming? ill keep only my most played games on it
but ssds break faster if you writ on them a lot
oh yeah, i only keep games im actively playing on the SSD
05shitty thigsn are so small
00,10PS 2 is one of my fastist loading games
PS2 is the only game i notice loading
00,104sec from play to hud
because it does so much networking
08,01Chrysalis: from what i'm seeing, even recent SSDs will only come close to maxing out the bus by about 80%, and that's during high block size sequential reads
00,10and frankly that's plenty fast for me
08,01for nominal (4kb) block size random reads, it's much slower
also, MC on an SSD is godly
00,10oh good they are bringing back the AMAS system to gal's soon™
so far 43,5 Gb are filled with ponies only
PS 2 is demanding, that's why
08,01>argues with the computer scientist
08,01>loses
08,01:P
and today it will bve about 0,98 Gb more
What the hypothetical buck, why do I have ~880 GB of games?
I play like 3 of them.
08,01Chrysalis: i did not, actually
08,01i'm sure you told me at some point, but i forgot
Systems programmer for Barcrest
00,10because you dont uninstall
Sumica: True, I have a tendency to leave stuff lying around.
08,01or engineering
00,10bulshit, computers are not science.
00,10they are magic
*snort snort*
08,01Sumica: it's common knowledge that all electronics work on the principle of magic smoke
power goes in magic comes out
00,10and a serise of tubes
you can release the magic blue smoke
<3 we both made the same reference
08,01clearly, we are made for each other
Computers are like magnets.
this is the best most intelligent thing i heared all week
00,10nah computeres hate magnets
08,01Kammerjunk: you can only place 3 inside your urethra before things get awkward?
00,10clearly they are opposing classes of magic
Sumica: Espeically hard drives, ow my hand
oh wow
i would still be at work normally
<3 afternoons off
08,01what do you do, Chrysalis?
Crossovers are Decade's fault! :D http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/285/841/c05.jpg

08,01apart from annoy the Bridgewater Hall with me?

08,01Chrysalis: that's actually pretty cool

08,01aniderp_work: what'd you do?
oh
i hate people
i hate my mother
when i get the effort im getting into programming on it
but the opengl wrappers are useless
she pissed me off before i left for work and not\wim in bad mood
i want to use mine as a mediacenter or for a cnc machine
08,01aniderp_work: i know that feel; what'd she do?
IF IT ARRIVES
can't VNC and use opengl at the same time
i wanted f\to cry in lunch.. im holding it in
Jake should do well in both regards
i dont wanna be near people riht now
aniderp_work, it might be better to just let it all out :/
08,01>BUCK staff member says Jake
no i would go to the bathroom and cry
well my arduino uno probably arrives in january
i hate people seeing me cry
08,01aniderp_work: what'd your mother say?
she takes my cord while im at work]
meaning it dies after awhile when im home
which led to the hitting my shoe on my head yesterday
08,01Jake: Jake is the name of our Vice Chairman; the bad cop to my good cop
aniderp_work, :/
08,01widely reported to have absolutely no sense of humour
08,01(though this is untrue... just)
mad aniderp is not a pretty site
well im not that jake
08,01i know
05good news
/me starts to cry silently
05i can make this a 24" x 36" pritn if i wanted
05unsure about how it would look but oh well
08,01it's just an automatic response now; i hear "jake" and i immediately expect to be yelled at because i'm telling my staff to spend too much money
Wrek, does this mean I don't have to be at BUCK to buy a print? :3
08,01AdamTheDuck: no, it means you have to buy one now, one at BUCK
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

AdamTheDuck: then I might risk uploading it to bronibooru XD
08,01i want to be the first to buy a print
00,10hey wrek, why the watermark?
05refresh and it should be fixed
Hi, Morning everyone

05that was awesome
MadSurge, check again :P
05love how it turned out
00,10have em doing........another pony =p
There there aniderp, just get through the day, when you get home you can let it all out.
It was Wrek, thanks. :)
05if i enable a print
05and you order it
i wont hit my head with my shoe again..my head hurts
05can you grab one of the largest oens to see how the image looks or something?
05dont want it to be pixelated
08,01seductive pose on a chaise longue
05then i know what print size to mass produce for BUCK
I absolutely love it now I can see the full res! it's absolutely brilliant, wrek!
well.. i have to go
08,01Wrek: generally, you don't want to be going below 150dpi
05SafariMonkey-: its actually set to restrict
bai ;_;
You take care aniderp, when you get home you can let it all out.
08,01so A2 is your hard limit, i'd say
05waht you see is only... a bit less than half original size
Bai :)
08,01but for best results, somewhere between A2 and A3
Bye aniderp_work, try not to hurt yourself. :?
:/*
Wrek: (not *full* full, but a lot better than what I saw over stream) :P
05whtas the inch size of an A2?
08,01hey wrek, would you mind if i commissioned my OC letching on your OC?
Guys i've made some gif, if you want to see it go ahead c: http://sta.sh/0f93btii5un
08,0123.4 x 16.5
08,01Sumica: same question to you
00,10Twi is the only pony for wrek.
00,10well twi and LadyC
08,01Wrek: you can be looking disdainful
So?
hey Wrek how big is the original after its flattened?
my first attempt to do it in photodhop
Goodnight everyone. :)
0512 megs
05adn thats in PNG
Jake pretty :3
nite AdamTheDuck
08,01gah
05holy fuck
08,01i'm outta ideas
0555£
05for the largest print
05xD
do the macarena
08,01seriously?
cause i am
00,10that sounds like alot
05and thats not even the maximum size the iamge goes
Sumica it is a fair amount
00,10DA over charges cause they do it per unit
08,01for that, i can have you just send me the file and get 5 prints that size at my local print shop...
00,10they dont get the bult rates
08,01Wrek: we spend a lot at our print shop; might be able to organise a discount for you
05and
05like
05remove the need for me to bring the pritns with me when i come
also, Wrek its actually £68.65 here
05i can even let you in on profits...
05xD
cause they charge tax at uk rates
08,01Wrek: well, yes, but that means *i'd* need to bring them then
08,01and i already have a ton of stuff i'll need to take
05true
08,01did you see my suitacse last time?
Wrek i can do it if youd like
05yes i did in fact
considering i live in manchester
05that would be fucking wonderful Chrysalis :3
08,01i had to bungee mic stands and a carboard roll to it
08,01SafariMonkey-: they are, but it'd be cheaper for wrek to just take them as lugguage
I can just bring my suitcase full of prints for you if youd like
Wrek: now your Vinyl is on Bronibooru :3 along with some more stuff you did
05link
05also Chrysalis: if i could send more than jstu the vinyl pritn aswell
05if you have a locla printer that is
of course
Wrek: http://bronibooru.mlponies.com/post/show/55307/crystallized-headphones-vinyl_scratch-wreky it still needs to be approved by a mod though
theres a print shop not too far from where i live
ill go
and do
...well stuff
bb
08,01Chrysalis: i can recommend you a print shop
05also
05all prints from buck will then be signed ofc
05givign them extra nieche
euch money dust takes ages to wash off
05in stead of peopel buyign them of DA
LOTS of pens
sign everything
05heck
^
05like
05if i end up with only one left
05or sumthin
speaking of boorus, Wrek I got one of the admins to remove that unsavory comment on that luna pic of yours on derpibooru

Hey IMMABRONY
Welcome back VenHur :)
SafariMonkey: No, I haven't. :D

Welcome back, VenHur. :)
I was looking at some Youtube videos on E3's history.
Welcome back, VenHur
how've you been VenHur
No one's streaming at the moment, IMMABRONY. :)
Oh, fine and all.
AJIsHaunter: Basically, british weather is pretty wet and rubbish most of the time
hey guys
At least it doesn't rain here in Denmark. Over here, it's just kinda dark.
I for once never attended any E3s, but there's a similar convention here in Mexico.
SafariMonkey: If that's the case, then I would like it there very much. :D
(I named myself fag because when ever someone replus it'll say "blah blah blah fag"
IS ANYONE ON THE CHAT TALKING?!
nope.avi
whats avi
idk
i know mov and jpeg and wmv
*jpg
this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvdf5n-zI14
AJIsHaunter: When I say rubbish, it's by here's standards. I kind of prefer it to 45*C heat or (worse) 35-40*C w/ 100% humidity
100% humi wtf?
That is a lot of humidity.
So does anyone remember the good old TurboGrafx-16?

omg, i forgot to "watch" wrekk
wrek*
oh my
whats ur guys fav miyazaki films?
The one with the people in it.
I've been noticing some of the drawfriends have been getting duplicates of ones from previous drawfriends
SpadeKyurem[School]: Well, it must be hard to remember every image posted in a drawfriend.
Bronysith castle of caglistro by degault
default
No..I mean the last drawfriend had the same spike picture as the one just now
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YME40ObCkVI
Its weird
did he make one where this warrior in feudal fapan finds this wolf dog princess girl and it was pretty gorry?
Oh.
nutbar
also
Imma make cookies :P http://i.imgur.com/gwMaJ.jpg
made that last night.
Anyway...back to reading more Dwarf Fortress
um wait what naturesfury
otakon: sec im looking for it right now
was that english? I looked like english
SpadeKyurem[School]: is dat game fun?
It*
Oh it can be loads of fun
principessa Mononoke
especially seeing how crazy your game can spiral into chaos
what its called
er sec
otakon: is secret of mana good? i dont think its good
that the frence name for it
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates - November 29
Secret of Mana is GREAT
nice ^^
Some times I have a hard time telling if Dari is a bot or not
it is a script
he is. dont let it when he actualy texts fool you
only when the text has color is it dari
anyway all I have to get ready to go to work
see you all later, take care
otakon: enjoy
and i swear none my of my fav fics never update :|
otakon: BRING ME SOME NUTS
naturesfury: I know dat feel
Bronysith: I'm a dishwasher not a squirrel
I whish I could have such forms
/me is out for now
bye bye
bye otagone
so how many of u read fics?
only clop fics
I have read and archived every fic I have ever read.
But not that many.
o you
Wait...
Yeah, I haven't read that many fics either, Kammerjunk.
I just said that I've read every fic I've ever read?
Kammerjunk: Yes.
I really need to get to sleep a bit earlier.
Kammerjunk: yup
Kammerjunk: u read my little alicorn, bringing up blueblood yet?
naturesfury: Eenope. Been busy with school and some physical books.
i still need to finish game of thrones
the book
not the series
they released a gmae too right?
sucked
Most tv show/movie games suck
i saw it in game informer mag, i ive never seen one on the shelves yet
Anyone seen the newest Game Grumps video of Sonic '06 yet?
Nope
nah
Only run of Sonic 06 I ever watched was Brainscratch's
the reason why sonic 06 sucked is because of the fans
I've seen Brainscratch's run of it. I loved it. :D
<.<
The game was shit regardless
the fans demanded it be released early
before they had time for proper completion
The physics were nonexistent
not the fans
hey
Hay
you are a sonic fan, so of course you are biased saying it is segas fault
<.<
Right because a game company can never be at fault for the quality of their game
and everyone knows sonic fans are some of the worst fans ever
You can be a fan of something and still be non-biased.
And Im pretty sure Sega has full control when they release a game, not the fans
https://www.humblebundle.com/
hm?
hey
Yeah?
I know of some underrated games!
VenHur: legend of dragoon
Bronysith: Cubivore for the Gamecube.
underrated games?
tales of symphonia
And I know the Sonic fanbase isnt the best ever, but saying their at fault for Sonic 06 sucking is utter bullshit
super mario sunshine
Custom Robo.
how bout sonic heroes? :D i love that gam
Actually, Super Mario Sunshine isn't that much underrated anymore.
jbh1145: I had a lot of fun with that game, but it does have its faults. :D
Same goes to Luigi's Mansion.
Chibi Robo.
God help you if you got the PS2 version of Sonic Heroes
people hate it cause there brain cant handle switching between chracters
oh no i have gamecube version
A game about a home robot that cleans up mess and throw away garbages.
The ps2 version has horrible framerate
I had a great time with Digimon 4 as well.
Thanks god I had the Gamecube version!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vcrga9bBj7o Speaking of Sonic Heroes
oh yea
still
legend of dragoon is incredibly underrrated
How about Skies Of Arcadia?
Billy Hatcher and The Giant Egg.
YES.
I loved that game, VenHur.
i honestly think shadow the hedgehog is kinda underrated too.'
The gameplay kinda sucked
jbh1145: It's a meh game to me, but I did find it enjoyable as a child.
I mean, WHY is it overrated?! They even put "From The Creators of FREAKING Sonic The Hedgehog" right on the cover!
Kinda?
dont make me laugh
I didn't mind the gameplay of Shadow.
The morality choice was non existent
It wasn't a problem to me.
its extermly weird for the sonic universe to go dark all of a sudden but the game is still pretty fun
I help you black doom, so get your soldiers to stop attacking me!
i also think majoras mask is underrated
oh you guys, talking about games n shit
No matter who you help, everyone tries to kill you
sonic 06 on the other hand.............sucked (duh)
Bronysith: Um, I'm pretty sure MM is NOT underrated.
underrated to other zelda games
It gets plenty of love as of today.
I feel like Sonic 06 is more of an "rushed" game rather than the game that was made on purpose.
If you're having Sonic problems, I feel bad for you, son. I got 99 games, but Sonic ain't one.
if i said i love 06 you guys would come and falme war me
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFMCVI0iTAo
jbh1145: I would? It's what you're interested in, I'm not gonna judge you for it.
well i still hate it
Depends on what you love it for
Oh, I love Sonic, too bad no one ever heard of Knuckles Chaotix any more.
i hate 06 no matter what
VenHur: OH, I wished I played that game as a kid.
I mean I wont fault you, unless you actually think its good designed
Some people actually think Sonic 06 is a good game...
...Now why Knuckles's Chaotix wasn't in Sonic Mega/Gems Collection...
SpadeKyureum who does
...On the other hand, why isn't SegaSonic The Hedgehog too?!
VenHur: I hear it was cut due to time constraints and copyright.
What I find bullshit is the exclusion of Sonic 3 and Knuckles in the Ultimate Sega Genesis collection
Since the person who created the design of Mighty quit Sega and took the copyrights with him.
okay i still like the 06 version but it dosent hold a candle to the orginal
They said it was disc space
YET THEY RELEASE A VERSION WITH IT ON IT
The fuck!
I'm going to be honest. I didn't mind the Werehog segments of Unleashed.
I dont see the issue with the Werehog really
AJIsHaunter me too
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVCvqT4qKi0
if your gonna say unnleashed sucked cause of the werehog, well idk whatas wrong with you
In fact, I had a pretty good time with the Werehog segments.
I can't believe this song is SO overlooked, it despicts Shadow's path of what's he is, and what's he suffered. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rryQVEGuI9c
I still find it stupid to have like 10 different endings but only one of the paths is cannon
...Am I the only one that sort of liked those levels? [FLAME SHIELD ENGAGED]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qZLTYb7mvA
Agreed, SpadeKyurem[School].
The only canon path is the one that gets you to the Black Comety
*Comet
YES
The worst line in Shadow has to be "Hey Shadow we're going to the ark! I guess that means we're going too!"
It had its message and feels.
SpadeKyurem[School]: I remember just sitting there for a second and saying "Did Sonic just make a grammar error?"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbndyrUQkEc
SpadeKyurem[School]: And I was like "No shit, Sherlock..."
Also I personally prefer how Heroes handled shadow
They left it ambiguous if he was a robot or real
I found the music in the game somewhat enjoyable as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kz2lecW2Y
Especially The Doom and Lost Impact.
I loved the music in Lost Impact.
Personally I pefer to having shadow being ambigous if he is a robot or real oposed to a alien
I love the game but I HATE the Hero Mission with the one trying to kill all the Artificial Chaos!
Also the line rouge says at the end of the dark team is a massive error
Hey everyone!
I just...freaking hate it...for trying to find...the last. FREAKING. ONE!
VenHur: I didn't have a hard time with it, to be honest.
She says "Did I ever tell you shadow is a robot" The origional line is "Did I ever tell you shadow isnt real"
aw.... no one said hi back :'(
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MWEHwvcnyM
hi everypony
Hi Woona!
SpadeKyurem[School]: So based on the ACTUAL line, the real one's supposed to be dead?
Its left ambiguous
Ah.
By real i think she means he was artificialy created
how are you VenHur
It was left ambigous if he was a robot or the real shadow
Good!
Ah, I see.
yes
anyways off phone shopping xD
And I liked how they handled that
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfIQEMQg_E
Then they pulled alien bullshit
I don't know HOW did Shadow survived at the end of SA2 and the start of Team Dark's story in Sonic Heroes.
btw the ending of shadow the hedgehog confuses the heck out of me, how does shadow suddenly appear in the ark and y does he say "goodbye shadow the hedgehog"?
Robotnik explains that in Shadow
He says one of his robots found him
You have to spend like 10 minuets in the final fight for it to show up though
Maybe Doctor Eggman must of found it and he's all like "I'm just going to put his dead body in a pod, It's clearly for fanservice! Ho ho ho ho ho!!"
Well Robotnik says if you spend 10 minuets in the Doom fight that one of his robots found him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB1Z338gcsU
I still haven't gotten all the emeralds in Heroes.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er4_p-yWP-Y
Egg emperor- CHARGE!
Flight is completely broken in Heroes. :D
wpw. that game is an insult to code
lolol good on you microsoft, this is actually a good promo video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD9FAOPBiDk&feature=player_embedded
Dark_Horst: Which one?
READY ALL CANNONS, OPEN FIRE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4VwbejD0yI
that sonic one
Dark_Horst: Which Sonic one?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9dFZJtQWc
Initiate Rottary attack!
hell if i kbiw, the one he posted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MWEHwvcnyM that one
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPSxVvkv004 I love the music for Eggman vs. tails from SA2
I know of another underrated game from SEGA besides Samba De Amigo and Billy Hatcher.
this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NocwTvB7puU
Amazing Island.
is Wrek here today?
Time for a change of pace
VenHur: Hmm, I've never heard of it?
*.
AJIsHaunter from this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmQREKsbIwQ
But my god the Egg Dealer is retarded
Uggh, I hated the Egg Dealer.
Who the hell builds a machine that shoots your self
AJIsHaunter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6r883n9uRY
But the other Egg robot, I actually kind of liked.
Egg Breaker?
ARGUMENT TIME
which was better... Ocarina of time or majoras mask?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MS6lVWKaXg Time for a change of pace!
Both
first of all
which was better
Story wise?
They're both good storywise.
worse water temple
Water temple isnt that bad
Pfft, the water temple wasn't that bad.
how bout this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqnrgaTsw4
majoras mask water temple was worse
Master quest makes it even easier
It's the Fire Temple that annoyed me
Its enterly possible to do water temple first
Majora's Mask's Water Temple wasn't that bad either.
The temple wasnt bad
I hated the boss though
mrponiato
Fucking fish
r
Yep, I hate that fish.
GOD DAMN FISH
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOWEV9miNpc
Other than that, the temple's not that hard,
Boss fight!
*.
oh you guys are talking about majoras mask? well might as well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSj-6QUOK5g
I've never tried to kill the stone temple boss without the giants mask
How hard is it?
fun
SpadeKyurem[School]: It's not that hard.
It sort of reminds me of Shadow of the Collosus
You can need to time your arrows.
Even though MM came first
only not as awesome
*just need
shadows of the colossus is awesome
The boss music for MM is catchy as fuck
:D
Same with Ico. I loved Ico.
what do you think of the ben drwoned creepypasta?
jbh1145: Not scary.
i think its preety good
y'all need some real music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxmjgZCbdxI&list=FLfoIzLWoeuz-u2bui2wZORw&index=6&feature=plpp_video
fuck that
00,10might as well stream for a bit before work
Oh hai sumica
Bronysith: no sir, fuck you
hey sumica
The giants mask is pretty usless after the stone temple
SpadeKyurem[School]: you need it
Actually it doesnt do anything outside the temple
Bronysith: when will you stop complaining about the context and just injoy the shit that'S been linked? like, oh i dunno, music?
for the fierce deitys mask
00,10so back to nanoha
Thats about it
Alot of the masks dont have any functional use except to get the super weapon
i said i think sonic heroes is underrated then a big sonic disscusion started which turned into a big zelda disscussion? i have no clue how that works
Its bronystate fuck logic
Card Captors?!
It kind of sucks that you need a mask just to hear the end of the stories of the grandmother.
chats work that way
no this is good music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jmty_NiaXc
I have the Deity mask but I hardly use it
Sumica's streaming at the moment, jbh1145. :)
It feels like cheating to use it
oh
Hi everybody :)

00,10well it hurts
how about gun
good thingie chats alive again
Nah, I'd rather use the Bat Credit Card.
00,10alive is a relitive term
00,10who knew auto play was so importatnt to keeping people active
00,10seems sudden stream was important
there is a stream?
well most people probably have the page in teh abckground and the sudden stream just directed their attention back

Hi, EEVERSTI. :)
what is this anime thingie?
how've you been EEVERSTI
Sumica, have you ever thought of using the XSplit function of streaming directly from your computer?
artist: Magical Lyrical Girl Nanoha
MadSurge: longest name ever
00,10you meen use a direct file rather then a player
the eyes! O.O
artist: the sequels have longer names :D
say them!
ohai alexxm, long time no see well nothing much, just finsihed drawing official cover of my mlp comic http://gyazo.com/0dda49dbd3f6de1c3d6b21867c103c77
EEVERSTI: Looks nice. :O
rebirth?
nice EEVERSTI
Well, I looked up on the list of features that Premium XSplit has, and it has that capability. I guess having anything less than godly upstream will make that useless.
artist: my upcoming mlp comic which have been for over a year in making
00,10well I can have it open the file directly but it wont support playlist options
EEVERSTI: sounds awesome.....GOOD FOR YOU!
00,10and the playlist plugin only sees mp4
EEVERSTI: wuts it abut?
00,10would be a pain to have to open file for every pmv
00,10and it looks like shit with out a pre-render when streaming tv
00,10so better to use mpc to act as both with ease of use
Bronysith: YOU!
?
00,10if i had a second screen I could use the directx capture
Imagine mom Testarossa married with Gendo Ikari. PARENTS OF THE YEAR :D
EEVERSTI: borderlands 2 reference?
00,10they could take turns beating their kids so they did't get tired
YES
lol, RD
lol
artist: what u want?
booooh
Sumica: you found this, eh? :D
Bronysith: hi

Thanks RainbowAsh I'll make sure I take full effect of the night clubs and gaming oppurtunitys XD
brb
Just realised those two really don't go together
back
pot80: norly
board games + night clubs = ????
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Pinkie Pie box Revealed from Enterplay
the board club?
cowvarkian Video games! :O
pot80: hmm
welp, brb gonna be on y home laptop
00,10vida games on cardgames
my*
blood :O
Michael: what a shocker
00,10that's realy gonna mess up his aim
that's a guy?
so what was that incedent I read about on the main page with the stream?
pot80, during the last episode, Bronystate got hacked by /v/
nope
AHAHAHA
00,10was not V
was GNAA
wasnt /v/
00,10was not a hack
people still think it was /v/
we got hijacked
no proof was gnaa was either
CLAIMED to be /v/, but more likely the GNAA.
what was it then?
Why interrupt a stream when there are about ten of them
just some chucklefucks hijacking mips
Hat: they interupted more then one
nothing more
pot80: some dumb people hijacking the stream
pot80: anyone couldve done it, as i understand it was just a mips stream override
Whoever it was-- it was a jerk. Little more need be said.
Hat, they interfered with all of them
Okay
13for root's sakes we're still complaining about the mips security hole last saturday?
did you get in a hastle with anonymous?
13the problem is fixed
13end
Shizuka: apparently
13of
13story
not complaining, just wondering who did it
Shizuka: aye aye
sorry Shizuka I wasen't here an was just askin :(
Shizuka, mips is safe to use now?
KILL HER
13no, they never replied
Hit her with your golden hair!
will you guys SHUT UP?! ITS OVER WITH
13considering that hole exists in the first place, i doubt they care enough
Oh god I hate this one level of Sticker Star
Bronysith: no thx
let me guess
the snow fort
Bronysith: Seeing how we have people who never knew about the hack, no.
No the giant fish level
00,10rocks fall, every one dies
in the jungle?
the mighty jungle
avalanche!
WHY WHY anime?
Getting riled about people talking about the hijack won't help either, Bronysith.
but that one aint too bad
So that's the end? What a shitty final boss
It gets harder the second time through
00,10and then I cliffhanger cause time to go to work
MadSurge: of course it is
The whole place asplodes. To be continued
MadSurge: its a final boss
They all danced the end
y anime :'(
Its way more agressive and the raft isnt the most manuvearable thing

You don't know what sick means?

Chrysalis: I can just addforce with that in vector on release, and just reduce the addforce to "fake" Friction with the help of Cross.
disturbing?
Chrysalis: To get a "I just released and going that way"
CriticKitten: *vomits profusely*
I haven't gotten it working yet, but if I get ths working with my own motor, I should be able to use Cross to do such a thing as well

Yeah, it's why you should always be thankful for your health. Because at least you don't need your blood filtered by machine because your kidneys don't clean the blood properly. It's one of those things that I learned from my parents (both medical workers) that always horrified me. They had horrible work stories at the dinner table.
CriticKitten: Too long, didn't read.
Yep
Pft, if that's too long, you're too lazy. :p

CrystalPhoenix: k
shhhh sonicdude558
flutter_spin: I don't I can see this happening
Dem maids o.o

Kipkat07_USAF, watch every Doctor Who
ello everypony
Douche!
Har har, racism is....wait, nope, not funny.
or at least from Cristopher Ecclesion
Kipkat07_USAF: Well, you can start from the serial
Why is SuperBrony64|Zzz sleeping?
well the tenth does say it once
Moo360: Because everyone needs sleep? :D
alexxm|foal: not to good, you?
Kipkat07_USAF: start with Cristopher Ecclesion like CrystalPhoenix said
He gets no sleepies
I honestly did not like Donna.
MODS SuperBrony64|Zzz IS SLEEPING ON THE JOB
alexxm|foal: got my iPod stolen today :<
if you're REALLY interested in the whole universe after you're done you can research in the earlier episode
Rose good. Donna, not so much.
I LOVE Rose
nurse redheart
Martha was soso. I hated the ending of that season
oh this episode :$
DH WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo
then again Donna is cool as well
My sister used to watch Doctor Who all the time
lol
IT KEEPS HAPPENING
thats gotta hurt
flutter_spin, though it had him
all the reason to enjoy the finale
Ewww...that isn't Matt Smith.
Semi Douche.
sup Phase4 new bundle is out, sadly is windows only
I learned rather quickly the season finales are not to be taken too seriously. I love how the seasons wrap up with all the elements intact but...
Moo360: and we all know matt smith is best doctor! :>
twilight_squirtle: IKR
Moo, David Tennant i awesome! They all are!
Moo360: I like Tennant :<
Yesh. It is like "hey lets make super chaos"
Dream diaries and stuff.
Typhloni_link: You like FAKE STUFF
Pssh, Tom Baker was best doctor
twilight_squirtle: Don't let dari catch you saying that :I
MLP_Brovakiin: you just pinged him D:
:O
sorry :I
Moo360: I haven't gotten to Matt Smith and I don't want to yet. Im enjoying the Tenth Doctor
Pinkie Pie :O FTW
Rose :(
Typhloni_link: 18th Doctor is best Doctor
she seems to calm, i bet shes an enemy
Cool, the TARDIS!
lol. Dat 18th doctor
too*
I don't want to wait for the episodes as they come out
I like watching em back to back :(
This is the worst adult film I've ever seen.
B<3<3<3H.
My uncle mocked me for watching Dr. Who. Then again, he mocks me for a lot of things.
flutter_spin: whats wrong with watching it?
There's maids in it but yet they are fully clothed...I don't get it...
what.
What's on third.
sometimes he says things that are right! :O
He rolls 20s on his perception checks
After thinking about a response, I don't really have a good one.
beer time
My family has a habit of "you are wasting your time with..."
flutter_spin: ah I've been there

Am I the only one that enjoy Ecclesion a bit more than Tennant?
Doctor Who!!
Aeroplane
CrystalPhoenix: At first I was like that but I grew to like Tennant more
thats a weather ballon
9th doctor ~ too aggresive for my taste. Tennant ~ fun and lovable. Matt ~ crazy and mysterious
how come this guy looks so fimiliar
clearly swampgas reflecting the light of venus
lol Trixi
Not a very good shield if he can walk through it
flutter_spin: I kinda thought the same with the 9th doctor as well
CriticKitten: its a trap
CriticKitten: not a shield
not a shield, its a cloak
flutter_spin, maybe it was the aggresiveness that I enjoyed
I loved Rose, but her Mom... oh my word... her mom...
ESPECIALLY When he gets super serious mode
wut
flutter_spin: I agree
:I
I didn't like Rose....
EXTERMINATE!

probably latin
Must I explain Moo?

flutter_spin: Do explain.
Moo360: woe to men?:D
O U
ugh. I don't feel like it
You know what I like about this show? People die. As messed up as that is, I like that. They stay dead unless they are necessary to live.
LOL
I love that part
Typhloni_link: You mean like real life?
Moo360: no because in real life we don't have time lords coming to save people that are supposed to stay alive.
I would like to see her with long hair
Typhloni_link: Time lords are made of Jell-O.

CrystalPhoenix: Not sure, are the specials excluded on Netflix?
but then army gave me M16 :(
Nope.

LOL
ARSON, MURDER, AND JAYWALKING!
cowvarkian: essentially
looool
I witness the dead of my grandfather from my very own eyes recently

I haven't shed a tear
This is the worst companion
But the best doctor

Not really big on her
way to waste all the scarecrows
lol
AHHH THE SCARECROWS! IM ALERGIC TO HAY!
noi
/me dies in hay
/me duck duck duck duck duck goose
I like Rose and Martha more
spoilers: britain enters world war one
o they have more scarecrows
Donna is meh
Here's a how to get rid of scarecrows
bring in the Ponies
Donna was the best in my opinion.
they'll eat them
DOOOOOOOOOOOOCTER
goddamnit cowvarkian im still reading that history book!
lol
donna was the funniest in my opinion
Donna was pretty funny
She was sassy :D
And it was a nice change because she was never a love interest
way too sassy
I remember watching both parts of this plus the Utopia trilogy back to back to back to back to back. Best 4 hours ever
especially in the living fat episode
mhm
He's doing the eye thing again
Aww poor John Smith
:'(
John smith is the fattest student in my school. You dont want to be him Dr.
john smith is best pony
Time And Reletive Dimension In Space
I crie every tiem
O,_,O
wat acting, i crie evertim
Dari, that's a complaint I have in this new show. There's rarely a woman compainion who ISN'T a love intrest. Rose, Martha, even Amy at one point...
I would love to watch the Utopia trilogy after this
Holla everypony! :)
Blaze: apparently I can't see that
hey GilDash
Blaze dude, almost every female companion of the Doctor has had feelings for the Doctor
You're forgetting River Song
hola GilDash :)
I didn't mind some sort of love interest, as long as it was accidental, not like Rose's mother
River Song was the only character I watched for after Tennant left
Typhloni_link, you can catch the charity specials in youtube
Ah thanks CrystalPhoenix
Haku1013: But have the feelings ever been both ways?
Haku1013: so, feelings for = love interest?
Hi, GilDash. :)
well it's a good thing they had a lot of river song episodes
Its only gone both ways a few times
Blaze: I didn't think so
Blaze: except for river song
or maybe rose
River Song is the only love interest who actually got THE Doctor as far as I know
bah
Dr. Who?
Rose was definitely both ways
no, doctor frankenstein
:O
Yeah, but she got a clone
She didnt get the real Docotr
Rose got her own freaking doctor to love
Yeah, but the clone felt exactly the same way he did
She got A Doctor
'it wants to be held'
Was exactly the same other than a human life span
cowvarkian: Rose kissed the Doctor before, Martha WAS for a while, and Amy almost got to second base with the Doctor.
This quote
Love it
He is like fire and ice and rage
Yes, but real Dcotr had to live on without her, even though he DID love her.
all those references
Rose was "both ways" with the doctors.
Blaze: hmm
Hell, I even think JACK had a crush on the Doctor!
its an invasion
Jack had a crush on everything
ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun
hes likee fire and ice, hes like darkness of night, hes like the shizzle to mah hizzle
yeah and we both know that Jack crushed on everyone
Jack was gay, butwe only saw him a few times in this show
dari, Jack WANTED to crush everything.
Comedy Clip of Amy & Rory. Now that was funny.
Jack was both ways
Jack was awesome
he flirted with EVERYONE
why are we speaking in the past tense
with EVERYTHING
he was ready to die a fwe minutes ago
Jack did kiss the Doctor once to be fair
why not now
I loved Jack's humor. I didn't like how much he flirted
He was a good character
poor john smith:( :'( :S
Dari, Ellecsion or Tennant?
I dont want to go
;:'(
I want a "The 13 Doctors" special
Eccleston wasn't it?
:'(
yeah he spelled it wrong
yawn
:'(
Definitely a tearjerker, this episode was
so...you come here often?
Ecceleston was a good Doctor.
Probably. Really, I just LOVE Ecclestion's Doctor, but Tennants is just AMAZING. Smith is pretty good, too.
One of the better episodes. And one of the sadder.
I would show my feels, but dari is watching o_o
flutter_spin: right in the feels :(
Doctor's Wife - That episode rocked
why is he suddenly such a wimp, he was ready to give himself to the aliens a few minutes ago
you know, that lady looks like Smith in a wig
Yes, then you wuold be hit with the ManUp.jpg hammer
Tennant = Our "4th Doctor"
BLINK NEXT!! OR THE BLOOPERS!
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the only thing to remember in this episode is the watch really
Indeed
Blink is one of my favourite episodes
Hahaha
inb4 kick?
Now THAT is harsh
Let him see how life would be
Then take it all away from him
Yeah thats pretty fucked up
Is this doctor Who(oves)?
and then SNATCH IT AWAY
yep
and the aliens dont kill him in that life?
Old Doctor
Cool!
agh! old doctor
lol "everyone safe"
I forgot, does the Doctor remember being John Smith?
So....uh...what's happening?
he does
He died. GREAT.
Eccsleston was a Doctor recovering from a war, and trying to forget it. Tennant was a Doctor slowly coming to terms with that and learning from it. And Smith is/was a Doctor who had, very much, the closest thing he ever had to a family and lost it. They all echo across each other to my mind.
He even references the name 'Mr. Smith' a few times later on
just do it you wimp
This part ^^
please
so theres two shorts/ specials that conclude Tennant's arc right?
clever clever doctor
I LOVE this bit
he made himself an idiot..
wish me luck, BronyState, i haver a date tonight ^-^
seems legit
dem aliens make better bullies than Babs
smitty ur an idiot
Rose`Date: good for you
PrincessLuna: he became human
Good luck Rose`Date :)
inb4 its a trick
Rose`Date: I think I have never heard that before here. ^_^
^-^ thankies
Good luck Rose`Date :3
im aware, i was quoting them Typhloni_link
THERE
lol
oooh good luck Rose`Date
nice Rose`Date have fun
:)
That's where I started to LOVE this episode
PrincessLuna: ah
OWNED
AWWW YEAH!
lol
dat doctor:)
:D
da glasses
DEM BUTTONS
<3
YES
clever clever doctor
HOLY SHIT OWNED
<3333 Run
Run
Run.

yeah I love how he outfoxes people <3
I LOVE this ending though
push ALL the buttons
KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
They should have all eaten an apple
he takes up on a ride
This ending is amazing
Rule One. The Doctor LIES.
yep. Love the ending too
if they had an orange they would have been ok
he fought with gods?
lol
:O
twilight_squirtle: yeah
wow
yay
I love this one
How'd do that?!
....This is... Isn't the doctor! This is a cruel thing!
he cant just kill them?
Monkey's paw.
Thats something Ive always wondered: how the fuck did he put her in a fucking mirror?
hes still doin da face even in death
Whats the fun in that?
twilight_squirtle: They wanted to live forever, they got their wish I guess.
the doctor DOESN'T KILL
dayum, he a dick
twilight_squirtle: The thing about the Doctor, is, well... he doesn't have superhero powers, not really. He doesn't have incredible abilities. He's just clever. But... he's SOOO VERY CLEVER.
Anyone up for Mann Up?
he just gave them what they wanted, twisted like a genie's wish
damn
AJIsHaunter: dick move
weeping_pegasi82: have you watched this season?
Pity? Pity he is still alive.
Nittany, you nekked
ohai Nittany_Discord
/me dusts Nittany_Discord
well sometimes he doesn't
Why is Nittany_Discord not light blue anymore?
Hmm
I dunno
i suppose i's be up for one Nittany_Discord
Maybe
no
yes
Because he is lazy
:(
maybe\
possibly
i'll play Nittany_Discord
:(
miost likely?
Nah
Hi
yawn
this isnt sad at all >_>
hi SayWhat
SayWhat Bobobo!
Wha?

Cheerleading is biggest troll. I have to be at my competition this weekend at 10:30....:'( And hi everypony...
this is my faverit doctor
twilight_squirtle: I see what you mean, but there is a price to pay for these kinds of things.
what is dis?
hey SayWhat
AND THEN SHE WORTE A BOOK
poor smitty:'(
Hi, Kawaii_icybeauti. :)
worte?
WROTE
SHUT UP
Hi AJIsHaunter
ah
hi SuperBrony64
The problem is-- she can look inside hsi hearts-- and there's one too many.
/me is getting tired
/me pets sonicdude558
hia Kawaii_icybeauti
/me slaps sonicdude558 awake
What is this? Hi scout19_tf2
dOCTOR whO
huh?
Doctor WHo
sonicdude558: its only 731
DOCTOR WHO
What do you mean "What is thi?!?!"
AJIsHaunter|Studying: sucks for the people they took voer too
*over
Don't give me those big sad eyes, Raggedy Man
oh yeah... I gotta do hw in 30 mins
this music
Howdy doo, I love you! :D
Kawaii_icybeauti: this is doctor who
Can't wait till there's a new Doctor
Im the Doctor. Doctor who? Exactly
30 minutes later!
NO WAYY!
I might start watching again
ikr
a wild Ponies47 appared
*appeared
okay in ready
I'm happy they killed off the new companion
should i give matt smith a try?
Here is an idea: Why can't the aliens shapeshift into the doctor :P
dari who'd you want to play the new Doctor?
hug;)
Ponies47: Insert terrible shriek here
I think the story is what helps Matt Smith
Rowan Atkinson was awesome
matt smith ofc :>
Doctor Who. England's answer to Star Trek, and has lasted-- on and off-- far longer. And it's mostly about a very sad, very lonely man... whi is forced to be more.
hi Ponies47
When he played the Doctor
Dari, is Smith THAT bad?
AJIsHaunter|Studying, :3
what
Pfft
lonely? Reminds me of :( anyone?
Ryunosuke: well duh
Not possible Ryunosuke
What if it turns out he's Hitler?
Matt Smith is like David Peterson (The 5th Doctor). He's not the best Docotr, but he's good. Sadly, he came after one of the best Doctor ever and has to live in the long shadow left by his predecessor.
awwwwwww:$
doctor who?
Smith is my personal fave. It's very close between him and Tennant, but he just barely wins
sonicdude558: thelonecubone?
:3
I found about 9 pop tarts wrappers in my room today... :|
:)
We'll see
I'm gonna guess FERB is going to be the next doctor :3
huh MLP_Brovakiin?
And, I missed te TARDIs...
To the future
SayWhat: No Milky Ways?
SayWhat??
hi MLP_Brovakiin
BACK TO THE FUTURE
sonicdude558: Oh don't worry :P
Hai LoGaN|nothing :)
That poor ostrich.
do i here David Tennant
nothing just doing nothing
yes, you, do
flutter_spin: Poop Farts > Milky Ways
I mean Pop Tarts
Hi LoGaN|nothing :)
how long has Doctor Who been going?
fun fact, the serbian assassin failed his first attempt to kill france herdinand, it was luck that gave him a second chance
hi
to the right to the right...
Well, I have to commence studying for my math test....And practice is being extended tomorrow, so I'll see you all after I watch the episode.
Haku1013: Smith is also-- to my mind-- one of the most "Alien" Doctors... less human, and in his way, trying to be more so. Thus his long-- and tragic-- relationship with Amy, and driving him to be-- for once-- proactive.
MLP_Brovakiin: and you ping me because i'm lonely? :3
ever wonder what the last emoticon will be?
Why so many hyphens?
and Hi Ponies47 :)
thelonecubone: Maybe >_>
hey Ponies47
dat background music
Kencolt finally someone who understands
hyphens are cool
Dat old boy
o7
If he wants to use hyphens -- let hi

Haku1013: Well, tome it's obvious- she was there from a cvhild to an woman to a loss-- closest he ever came to a family, in a way.
I've seen Blink three times already and it's still awesome

Kencolt damn straight

please?
so... whats now? moar Doctor Who?
No kidding, dari.
HEll yeah Dari
IKR <3
i cant tell which is better Doctor Who or MLP
that came out wrong
Blink was my first episode to watch. It made more sense after watching through all the season.
Neg?
who da hells talking
<3
How about the Utopia trilogy?
Utopia?
"Doctor's Wife"
tis epic
This show is just fricking amazing, I can't believe I never saw it before BS.
i wub woo dabi
blink!
I like Blink
dr donna!
do eet
Have you shown the Library one?
doctor who stinks to me
Blink is shown too often here
you know what?
LoGaN|nothing: blasphemy!!
who da fack is talking?
Doctor Who ft the Gyrobowl
scout19_tf2: god
make it happen
what?
scout19_tf2: dari
Chan, Chantho gets on my nerves, Tho.
Lets watch... ponies
nnnnnnnnoooooo
Torchwood.... It's AWESOME!
heyeayeaeyaeaeyaeyaeyaeyaeyaeyaeyaeyaeyaeyaeyea....
oh
Haku1013: shush you
scout19_tf2: God.
What a nice simple ping, lol
oh the queen, all hating on the dr
dont play it!
so in the series, when does The Waters of Mars take place?
has anyone watched the show Torchwood?
YUS
lol. I didn't want to go through the hardache of the spinoff series.
well praise jesus haleuiah
....
oh god
Gyrobowl!! \o/

XD
gyrobowl is fake
<3 dari
Damn you dari

weeping_pegasi82: ^^^
hahaha
all praise gyrobowl, our lord and master
also, dates in 7 minutes
That bowl is made of witchcraft
gyrobowl OP

It's not kid proof, my mom got me one
twilight_squirtle: you mad that your god isnt featured? :>
:)
Fuck gyrobowl
Gyrobowl
IT
My god is Luna
NEVER
SPILLS
pff bitch please, gaк is the true lord
so daris a brit :D big serprize there
the song sounds like Animaniacs
Rose`Date: you're eating dates in seven minutes, or your date is in seven minutes
thelonecubone: to be expected of gyrobowl propaganda!
Well, it's kind of simple to me. Rose Tyler was the great romance of his life that never really worked out. Amy POnd was... family, that grew up around him, in a way... Daughter, sister, mother-in-law-- that last was awkward-- and family.
yay!
guys I am getting dizzy
wait, there's a Torchwood episode that latches onto a Dr. Who episode?
Barrowman!
PLAY SOME ANIMANIACS
Oh my yes

Industrustible
Dont dig into them idiots

The land of Angst and Bado Piercing?
The fact that there was even an END of the universe states that the 11th Doctor was succesful in fixing the Big Bang.
*Body
shhh. It is part of the episode Kencolt
yes
yoda
DAVID BOWIE
Haku1013: doesn't mean that it won't start over
He can't die
looks like a good time to me!
HYOOOOOOMAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNN
Well, I suppose he can't be killed
Is more accurate
He can die, he just comes back about a minute later
eeyup because of rose
But, spoilers
Dr. Who explains it in this episode
Thing is , if you stream Utopia , you kinda have to stream "the sound of drums" and "last of the timelords" as well , dont you ?
(;
HUUUUUMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANN!
hehehe
brb
Dagh
well unless the allusions to him actually being the Face of Boe
TrixieMuffin, of course
is real
but shhh
lel
Zamer: hush

Death is a mere slap on the wrist for Jack.

CrystalPhoenix: <3
Spoilers
Ooh, THIS episode!

O.o
drums op
lol CrystalPhoenix it's not a spoiler since it's never actually stated nor proven
WAT
Zamer: tis implied, tho
We should leave
This whole 3-part episode feels like a movie.
^
Funny how this trilogy works when you never seen the older episodes
But he can't leave never knowing
wtf lol moved my covers some and my remote behind my laptop jumped up and hit it
There must be a doctor who movie
:#

JAAAAAAAAAAAACK

Fuck right off
:P
Gotta run
I watched this season before season 1... made this some weird season
lel
The Dark Foce versus The Time Lord?
Derpy_Hooves dun did it
Blaze: It'd be a censored bar because he'll literally FUCK anything that moves if given the chance.
Derpy_Hooves: thats premise for a paddlin'
MAI GUD!
EPIC CROSSOVER IS EPIC
Eddmario: IKR
EddMario: True.
and lookin goooo
d
OH SNAP
lol
Martha be jelly
Blogging
BLOGGING!
baby momma drama at the end of the universeeee
So, I won't be here for next week's movie night, as I'll be watching the VGAs live.
blogging?
conglomeration
dat word
tweeting now
Eddmario, VGA?
as in
Video Game Awards?
because science works like that, right
where call of duty is game of the year every year
meh not a fan of Spike for anything other than MxC
lel
CrystalPhoenix: Spike TV video game awards.
screw science this is Doctor who
Bronysith, last year it was Skyrim
Virginia Awards? :3
Eddmario, yeah
don't watch that
not worth it
Spike was fair for maybe 1 year or so. Then G4 happened and... I stopped watching
heck last year was absolutely ridiculous
G4 is bad too, theyre trying to become the new Spike
But G4 is good!
VGA's are ...
G4 is HORRIBLE
Typhloni_link: wasn't g4 first?
CoD MP could use less dying too fast.
they ruined Tech TV
I dont like them to be very honest
Totally CrystalPhoenix
i dont watch anything that reviews games that are from huge companies, easy to pay off
get to da sylar
Why is everyone hating on SPike? I like Spike.
"Mass effect 3s ending is the best in any game series ever"-game informer, LIARS
Dem teeth
Spike is meh with me
HUMENS
Teeth
G4 though
cowvarkian: but in terms of the content and the feel, it was actually about tech, games and the culture. now its like Spike. For men blah blah blah
Haku1013: because it's a worthless piece of shit
oh THAT Spike
basically the way I see VGA's is the one with the biggest advertising is the winner, there are exceptions, but tbh, thats what I feel the VGA's are
Those advertising dollars.
Bronysith: I think they were sarcastic
Ryunosuke, here's how I feel about VGA
Blaze: they gave the game a full 10/10
Who remembers 'The Screen Savers'?
Haku1013: yeah, spike is best pone, but the TV channel is yeah...
you know
Are any video game reviewers ever actually honest?
LOOK AT US WE ARE SO GAMER AND MAINSTREAM
Trillions of years in the future and they still use bullets. Because kinetic weapons are just better
CrystalPhoenix: well
SpadeKyurem[School]: Can't say.
SpadeKyurem[School]: no
flutter_spin: I remember
inb4 mane
I don't believe them.
I still think IGN is the worst
it insult the gaming culture
Bronysith: ......Never mind. Altough, I think they're the most unbiased group in the world. >_>
Any game that isnt CoD is utter shit
Blaze: they were paid off by EA man
/me covers mouth
Le Mast6er
*Master
oooo Spades. What have you started?
This is Ponies47 I named my OC this :p
Bronysith: You sure? >_><_<
"A Doctor of everything?! Finally, someone who can check my prostate!"
true, but the games that usually win, are big name games, games by the big producers, Blizzard, Micro$oft, etc, despite them being "Bad" games in terms of playability, replayability, coding, bugs, etc
SpadeKyurem[School]: Halo, Kingdom Hearts, Skyrim, Fallout, Spyro, Crash Bandicoot. Your argument is invalid.
Ign seems to think otherwise...
EA and Activision have all the major reviewers in their pocket. Its no surprise
Not that I listen to Ign anyway
i dont even listen to IGN
Typhloni_link, O.O
I go by word of mouth tbh
Same o' Jack
Typhloni_Link: That's why I watch Yahtzee Croshaw!
if a game is good, I will hear about it :)
I don't really like multiplayer games anymore...
Blake, Yahtzee is satire
You'd think the English language would change a bit in all that time
Dr. Who has the best words
Lawl
Jack
not even portal 2?
Down boy
You have to judge games by yourself
Hahaha
magmablock: it is INDOMITABLE
yahtzee can be a bit ... biased, but ... he does give his idea on what games feel like :)
Bye guys :)
you can enjoy the worst game ever
jack
/me passes out everypony a Twi plushie
:D Doctor Who time?
Bye sonicdude558 :)
CrystalPheonix: It's still his opinion
AAAA Tennant <3
heck look at Sonic 06 Game Grumps
LadyCanary: eeyup
Dat LadyCanary
CrystalPhoenix: hahaha they have fun with how bad it is
hi LadyCanary
So, are all 3 parts gonna be streamed back to back tonight?
To me, the BEST games ever are the most influential and enjoyable, not the most profitable and biggest.
Typhloni_link, exactly
hi LadyCanary
Yep
and that's what video game should be
FUN
Wait a second...THIS IS A DABI STREAM?!
Spy!
CrystalPhoenix: :D that was a funny episode
for example, going back to EVE, yes, it can be a grind, and there are ALOT of things that feel like a second job, ie. Diplomacy, HOWEVER, just like PS2 EVE is best played with friends and not alone :)
Mebbe
>_>
Haku1013: Sadly, game companies ddont care about that
<_<
no matter how you can catch it
Dabi bby :3
Ohai LadyCanary! <:
Chan, here we go, tho.
Haku1013: If it doesnt sell a fuck ton, they dont make more
stopp it
Ponies47: what was with the face?
http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/People_Jack_Harkness_2676.jpg
ohai LadyCanary
maybe later blue
oh Jack
Good to see a stream of yours, Dari
What a man-whore
Typhloni_link, IDK. Just being silly as always :p
LadyCanary: YEAH IT IS
magmablock: broken link
Haku1013: Well, that's a matter of taste, because-- after all-- those games wouoldn't have been so big and profiable if some people didn't enjoy them and find them playable.
Silly. Fun doesn't pay the bills.
Ryunosuke: no, Neil is
Ponies47: ah :3 Silly is good
ahh
the doctor's hand
lets give her a HAND :D
The manwhore one?
yeah
Typhloni_link, Yesh it is :3
whats new dude?
Eddmario: Huh. Works when I click it
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Applejack's Awesome Apple Acquisition
Im gonna be the last human
<.<
Or notn.
Kencolt true, but the sometimes the same game just starts being rebooted with different maps and slightly different weapons. *cough*CoD*cough*
When I first saw him in Eccleston's last ep?
yeah
?
The reason CoD keeps getting made is because people buy that shit
He only had one line or something, but I thought he spoke weirdly
what
Wasn't really sure what to make of him
O.O
Haku1013: THAT one I won't argue.
"BARCELONA!"
^
Yet good games dont get more...for some reason
How about we be quiet and enjoy the Doctor??
Hermits United!
how bout the first episode of his season then?
HERMITS, UNITE!
what
Can't really remember weeping_pegasi82
>.>
it hasn't been 10years since the previous meeting Blazed
Blaze^
favorite episode with Tennant dari?
Lmao
This chat is confusing.
Aww.... Hermits, disband.
Probably Blink
Ive only seen Doctor Who with this guy O.o
Dem drums
Well ther was another guy with a scarf
:3
I've seen Doctor Who with David Tennant and the new guy.
I notice most people's favorites for Tennant are written by Moffat, not Russell.
Scootaloo stop playing the drums
one of us
the tall pale guy that kinda looks like a vampire
The empty child two parter is awesome
My favourite Eccleston
GottaHugEmAll: I have seen EVERY Doctor-- but I'm -- considering-- old. At least, been around longer than most here.
that the one with the gas masks?
hello everypony
HAH
Hi SkunkTari
:D doctor who :3
so, why do we still have wheels trillions of years in the future
Fantastic!
and gates
and humans
Kencolt: I want to watch some of the earier Doctors except for the 80s series for some reason
the tenth doctor is my fav
cowvarkian: Because Wheels WORK.
cowvarkian havent you been listening?
Haku1013: a bit
o.o
Humans are indomitable. We ebolve a little but then always revert back to the fundamental shape and form
DIAMONDS
Haku1013: I don't think thats how evolution works
big beautiful DIAMONDS
Haku1013: love that line
Lucy in the sky with Diamonds~
Don't call me Stella
O_o
Don't call me shirley
BIG BEAUTIFUL DIAMONDS http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7973/
cowvarkian actually it kinda is. Whatever works best is what stays. Evolution is all about what is able to keep the creature alive best, but Humans dont need to change because we dont change for our environment anymore, we change our evironment to fit OUR needs, thus allowing the same HUman form to aways stay.
CrystalPhoenix: *clicks* O_O those eyes! :D
Man, this old guy is SO nice!
EXTRA POWAAAAA
Professor Yana is my favorite Doctor Who character. If you've seen this 3-part episode, you'll know why.
Haku1013: whatever you say, george
GET ON WITH IT!
Haku1013: Could NOT have put it any better.
one of us...
Eddmario: I have !
Eddmario, shhhhh
1, 2, 3, 4...
So why does he always hear drums?
do
You'll see
Hahaha
Haku1013, http://i.imgur.com/YPVsy.gif
Has the Master always heard drums?
Haku1013: just wait
Eddmario spoilers
Haku1013: You'll know why.
I KNOW WHO HE IS
Remember, spoilers equal kick
Haku1013 just watch
IVE SEEN THIS SHIT COUNTLESS TIMES
Pfft
needs more desu
It is if you don't really watch Doctor Who
does anyone else wanna see a ME like Doctor Who movie as much as i do? :D
There IS a Doctor Who MOvie
oh :$
It features the 8th Doctor
but it wasn't that good
The only time we ever SEE the 8th Doctor is in the movie, then we read about him in the books
There was a movie back in the 90s, made in hopes of rebooting the series, but it didn't go anywhere. That's why the 8th doctor has less than an hour of total time
what is going on?
well i meant w/ the 10th one lol the alien chick reminded me abit of Mass Effect :D now im picturing Do Who in Shepard's armor lol
The 8th Doctor has to the real badas of the series since he's the one who fought in the Time War
weeping_pegasi82: It's considered canon, I think the movie was very good, and McGann's Doctor has a long history if only in text and radio.
Maybe for the Doctor Who 50th anniversary next year they're gonna show 8 regenerating to 9
uh oh
well to me it wasn't
The 8th Doctor has to be the real badas of the series since he's the one who fought in the Time War
EddMario: THAT WOULD BE GREAT!
music is good
DEATH
This Is Gallifrey is still best music
Ever
Didn't 8 look like a mix of Roger Daltry and Robert Plant?
this is galifrey is the best music
mhm
Number 8 did the most difficult thing. Which is why I think number 9 was kind of hiding from himself and his memories.
^
o_o
lolz
oops dead
leave him
Kencolt, so the time war......that was in the books?
:D
G'night everypony! :)
Too great, lmao
Cya GilDash!
night GilDash
Night GilDash
Night GilDash :)
dammit Jack
you sexy beast
why don't just take the suit
Wait.... Mario, you can't show 8 become 9, since he changed during the TIME WAR.
It makes sense-- before thatm the Doctors all kind of kept... and Eccentric appreanace. the Ninth was trying SO DAMN HARD to get away from that that he tossed out verey coat, lacy collar, and fancy cravat and went leather and skinhead. He simple HAD to hide from himself.
uh oh
dat Tardis
Blaze not really. We just know the 8th doctor fought the war and the 9th came after him sometime after the war. it could have been a long time after the time war before 9 came along.
Stray javelin, damn
But... he didn't do a very good job at it. Because you can't ever really hide from yourself. Even a Time Lord.
too an extent
closet thing though
Oh god!
He dies, but he always comes back
EGGS
Become a god
We have to see that
i'm back everypony, and it looks i have a chance to get to BMN and the Magic Duel episode after all.....
I loved when rose did that
Time lord becoming a god
vengeful god
O_O
EGGS-TER
actually he does become human during the events of Miracle Day
Obsidian: so he's the kenny of the doctor who Universe
cool
pretty much
:3
and thelonecubone Rory is the kenny
EGGS...TER...MIN...8
EXTERMINATE
FANTASTIC
Fantastic! He said it!
Oh damn
Jack. Possibly the human that can really understand the Doctor.
That's just BRILLIANT
Old man is going loco in the coco
Yeah
Jack who will always love everyone he loves and cares about
Same as the Doctor
lose*
Ouch
OH
MY GOD
WAT
THE WATCH
wait
what
Dun dun dun
WHAT
IT CAME BACK!!!
wow i thought it might be him, but seemed too farfetched
I KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT I WON'T TELL
Kencolt: for the earlier series, whats a good starting point?
i'm back again.......sorry my dad's computer derps a lot
._.
steal it martha!
Is it possible? Is he a.... A...... NO! IT CAN'T BE!!
stop this madness now!
Typhloni_link It's hard to find any-- I rather like them all... but I always had a fondness for the Fourth.
wb Dark92Enigma :)
IT'S A TRAP
hi thelonecubone!
still dont get the drums tho, or were there drums in that ep
twilight_squirtle: You'll see later
they're all on netflix but those are the ones that survived the BBC fire back in the 80's they're still recovering episodes though
twilight_squirtle: don't worry, by the end of this you'll know why
Kencolt: I'll try with the fourth then, thank you. And wish me luck on the hunt
ok
Y
A
N

Zamer: oh yeah, alot of the episodes were lost to that right

Badababum
oh noes!
:O
BEST
SHOW
EVER
:O
YOU. ARE. NOT. ALONE.
Typhloni_link: This series has been going on for 50 years in one form or another. It's got a LOT of backstory.
EPIC MOMENT + EPIC SONG = SUPER!!!
you..are..a...winner! just enter your email to receive a free car!
no... FANTASTIC
....I guess you had to watch the whole season/series?
Im lost.
:D
no RaveBrony each doctor starts off as a fresh start
Kencolt: Yeah, that was one of the appeals for me. A show going on this long MUST be good . And I was right :3
and RaveBrony this is near the end of Tennant's series
Ah
WHAT'S HAPPENING!
She has idolised him her whole life
Typhloni_link: same here!
Must suck for her
he still has another season right?
Dark92Enigma: /)

Im going to try to stay very quiet about the Master but I loved this 3 part-er
But what was up witht constant drums? What did they have to do with anything in his life?
NICE
:O
were they just a reminder saying he's a time lord?
Haku watch the End of Time two parter and you will find out
Oh no.
Haku1013: Drums sound like a Time Lord's heart/
Zamer yes yes I know
Typhloni_link: Same here. The Master's my favorite Doctor WHo villain. Well, the only stuff I've seen is 9th doctor and later. Haven't seen older series...
Yeah, you don't find out about the drums till S4
hes like old biff who stole the delorean
I HAVE SEEN EVERY EPISODE OF THIS SERIES I JUST NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE DRUMS
HAKU! A Time Lord's heart is like a drum
DA MASSSTAAAH
oh boy
REBORN
:O RAINBOW REGENERATION!
Haku1013: Have you seen "The End of Time" special? It explains the true origin of teh drums
Blaze is that it? Thats a little lame.
Ohai Sam from Life on Mars
RECASTING
UNLIMITED, POOOOOOOOOOOOWEERR
Eddmario: hes kinda the reason I want to see the older stuff. That and the 60's theme was awesome :3
RaveBrony: there you go.....the professor is the master (too late, blame my mom)
Haku1013: Eh. It's okay.
Eddmario yes yes i have again I have seen every episode
Haku1013: It's a link to the present that the old time lords have
Haku1013 they explained the drums in Tennants Last of the Timelord and End of Time just rewatch them again more carefully
Deadpan Snarker in 3....2....1....
ohai harold saxton
so whos the master guy? an evil time lord?
HA HA!!!!!!
Haku1013: It also explains a lot of why the 8th doctor... did what he did.
Dark92Enigma: O.O
Yes twilight_squirtle
yes twilight_squirtle
master
RaveBrony: mind blown
Master?
TOUGH
THOUGH
Wait...... MARTHA KNOW'S HIS VOICE?>!??

Yeah, The Master was introduced in the Third Doctor era as a recurring foe.
Bye bye!

RaveBrony: All you need to know is The Master is a bad time lord
.....Why the "", cubone?
ah damn, I wish I had the BBC
yea DoctorWho can do that to you RaveBrony
Blaze: not sure if it is a utopia atm
especially when you try to align the timelines
WAT :O
Yeah, all the humans went to 'Utopia'
....The CBC? Canadian Broadcasting Corporation?
RaveBrony: quick heads up. Doctor = Good Time Lord. Master= Bad Time Lord
See the posters? VOTE SAXON?

Ded
Sounds like a sitcom
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN
Swag

RaveBrony: He... He's a nutbar. An evil nutbar. Which would not be such a problem were he not a Time Lord. Which means he's an incredibly clever evil nutbar.
Dat smile
I see what you did there
How did he become prime minister without a back ground in Britain?
IT'S A TRAP
Kencolt: Ah, haha
well put Kencolt :3
Haku1013: Hypnotic shit
Explained later
And close up on the smile.
RaveBrony: And this is NEVER a good thing.
He made one up.

11 so far
._.
The Master and Captain Jack Harkness NEED to return during Matt Smith's run as the Doctor.
Not counting the movies.
Typhloni_link: Well, is there any other way to explain the Master? I thought I summed it up nicely.
becoming prime minister seems aiming kinda low for a time lord
Well there's only one Doctor at a time...Usually.
So it's not that confusing
Oh o:
the Doctor is the same person just with a different face
I was about to say... "Where the hell are they??" Lmao
Kencolt: I liked your choice of words though, nutbar hehehe
twilight_squirtle: Oh, you'd THINK...
what about the time several doctors materialised on the same planet
RaveBrony: When he dies he chagnes his body
twilight_squirtle: How else would you take over a planet? Do it from the inside!
except for "the Three(?) doctors?"
That's what each new Doctor is
or was it five
I forget how many it was
Same person, different body
:)
Eddmario: i would use aliens
Yeah, there's been a few multi-Doctor crossovers.
Wankahs
Ponyko those were the same person just from different timelines
So there's only one at a time, other than when they cross over the same timeline
Ponyko An exception. Time Lords arent allowed to meet themselves unless the situation is very dire
Yes Bronysith
tru
Ryunosuke: And "Time Crash"
Eddmario: and why take over earth, seems like a lousy planet anyway
And the Nutbar iws shining through.
he is Blaze
Blaze: Yeah
right
twilight_squirtle: Isn't his whole scheme basically revenge againts the Doctor?
And this is SOOOO english.
ded
(y)
The second he put the mask on, I would've RAN.
Eddmario: heck if i know, i dont watch doctor who
Sounds like the Republicans in congress... the final ones
lol Saxton is Pyro :D
Eddmario: Pretty much
Ponyko The Doctor has had to literally help himself several times. There's The 3 Doctors, the 5 Doctors, and a short where 10 meets 5 for a few minutes.
RaveBrony: I recommend you watch this show, its good :3
1 2 3 4,1 2 3 4.
TORCHWOOD REFRENCE!
There's also a Sixth/Second Doctor crossover.
ye i thought that episode was cool, old but cool
"Ohhh, like it matters"
Lel
vote for Saxon
hehe
Typhloni_link: Oh yeah, my friend showed me an ep awhile back. :D
The knock four times started here and then went to Torchwood, didnt it?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yZzhP1pxm8 <-- . . .this movie actually -exists-?!
I swear, the actress who plays the Master's wife seems familiar...

Lol, Sharon Osbourne...
Anne Widdecombe
hmm
Oh, that was him?
ok there it is
Martha's family were-- in this arc-- well, jerks. But they had no reason not to be. The Mster is good at what he does. It's just what he does is usually bad.
He's good at being bad
Man, Harriot Jones was a BITCH!
Harriet Jones? Real or Doctor-verse?
vote saxon
/me stares with wide-eyed horror at the titanic animated musical
i must admit i like the story ark through this series

EspyLacopa: RUN! RUN BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!
Didn't she play a character in this show during Rose's time?
RUN YOU STUPID WOMAN!
Blaze: Just watched the Nostalgia Critic episode on it.
allo!

Buytoast: But he has HAM

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
......Comedy in this moment?
to ease your minds
Blaze, that's why I love the Master
I heard those pings, dari. XD
<:
two masters?
That was genius.
Blaze: Dark humor. The Masters favorite
hmm what are we watching now..
So, who thinks the Breast Milk joke will become the new G which shall not be named?
Only if we let it
breast milk?
no
Blaze: It's a part of Doctor Who. It was originally meant to be an education children's show after all, about an old man with a magic box learning about history. It.... evolved.
:S
1,2,3,4...
:p
Does the mention of the g-oozeslime still auto-kick?

EspyLacopa: Eyup. Even linking to something that even has the word automatically kicks you
Once it said "We come in peace" I screamed FAAAAAAKE!
Deacon SWAG is dead, now and forever.
Nothing ever comes in peace
we come in peace, shoot to kill!!!

But they are yummy.
Well, he can't STAY dead.

They are like jelly bean insides, but more fruity, and less sticky.

Woah. Now THAT is a trip.
Twilight_Is_Best_Pon: it wasnt a hack, some guys hijakced the mips embed, its overwith, stop asking
Twilight_Is_Best_Pon yea, that happened, but it was a quick fic
*fix
My oc is called Strawberry-Twist

not really
Twilight_Is_Best_Pon: eh, i thought it was kinda funny
my oc is called lOgAn
Must have been a huge surprise though
So the spheres are supposed to be descended from humans?
I instantly changed stream, and did not find amusement in it
they are humans Polydunami
Polydunami they are the humans, from the future
so.... I heard of this site through memebase and....what is this site exactly if you dont mind me asking...
Polydunami: No, they ARE humans. Technically, they're cyborgs
Very well

The Great Gatsy... ugh, I hated that book. It made me realize that I liked The Catcher in the Rye.
Dat fluffeh
It's abpout to become wonderful.
Twilight_Is_BestPony: why the fuck would you tell us that?
Twilight_Is_BestPony: go die in a fire
Wtf?
Dat Jaymoo
Make some coffee

Twilight_Is_BestPony, I hope that's clumping litter in there.
welp, this chat is just awful now
Calm down Bronysith
SayWhat: a fly sat on the curtains, must symbolize his sadnes!
Isnt the Catcher in the Rye a book for serial killers
My cat once threw up in a plane, so the people made coffee :D
Oh hey, Jmo
i miss my uncle
it is clumping litter *phew*
Kandarihu lol
Moving on. What WOULD the Doctor do? :P
oh Master you're so silly
also
Oh my, jeesus my keyboard IT, WORKS
okay I am back
so if i'm following this right, he bounced back and forth in time to make a paradox to rule the universe?
this chat turned to shit, literally
How did I not pay attention to the Master's delivery of "I can SEEEEEEEE you!"?
The Doctor would do what he always does; run.
Huzzah fluffeh.
dafuq am I watching o.o
The Doctor? He'd probably let it happen actually, what with there being no other option. :/
At least you saw most of the ep
Polydunami would it involve timey wimey stuff?
Buytoast: EYup, and to get revenge on the Doctor.
Jmo, I knoww
Twilight_Is_Best_Pon Doctor Who?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Entertainment Weekly's Magic Duel Exclusive Clip

Noble sacrifice
failure to launch
;__;
:'(
yes I love Dr. Who :D
couldve actually shot him
holy hell
Eddmario: Except it's from EQD
Eddmario, it's his script
atl least mightve distracted him
Dr. Whooves is one of my favorite ponies :)
Citizens of Ponyville
than i said oatmeal? are you crazy!
suddenly Helicarrier
Deacon: tell me, you're joking :D
i dont like the guy they have as the doctor atm
LoGaN|nothing: LOL
Ponyko: Same here, hate Matt Smith's Doctor
^
I havent seen him
Spell-of-Gaming: I posted a link on EQD earlier this week, and almost got banned because it had "spoilers" in the post
Dark92Enigma they've got a clip of the new episode
he is too zany and a clown
Matt Smith is a Good actor and a GOOD Doctor, but no one likes him because Tennant lift such a large shadow and high expectations.
That's not why I don't like him Haku1013
when i was five my poppy dropped a wrench on my head... :'(
I think he's a bad actor
I hate his Doctor's character
Haku a lot of people like Smith
agreed
I like Matt Smith.
some even prefer him over Tennant
Lel
Rather, I haven't watched anything of the eleventh doctor.
Smith? As in Will Smith? Now listen up, here's a story, all about...
another countdown
That's fine
this guy LOVES countdowns
Just because I don't like him doesn't mean everyone has to
/me punches SayWhat
:(
will smith as new Doctor~
nye
nyeh
MYAAH
:D
TEH FUCK HAPPENED TO HIM!?
nyaah
otakon he aged, alot
He's 900 years old otakon

yes
Why is Venus Venus?
He looks his age.
yeah just about
Time Lord stuff
Timey Wimey STuff
Timey Wimey Wibbly Wobbley Stuf

DOCTOR
Polydunami: Exactly
CrystalPhoenix oh, where you gonna say that?
Doctor.

Deacon, no just....it was so clever
Doctor \o/
Super Jesus mode.
Lvl 100 activated
What exactly is happening here?
Yeah they got this ending from Okami and Earthbound
Doctor house for new doctor? . . . no? ok.
LoGaN: DeadMau5 and Skrillex stage pic
so i missed an earlier part of this ep, but how did that work?
this isnt even his final form!
Pshhh, Not even his final form
no idea, but I'm sure it'll be explained later
:D
The Doctor has reached level 101.
SayWhat: Hugh Laurie is too grizzled
lol RaveBrony
SUPER SAIYAN MODE!
Hugh Laurie? Pft. Totally Rowan Atkinson.
RaveBrony: /)
twilight_squirtle: The satellite network
Psychic field that the Master established

THE FINAL BATTLE

You're talking about wh the 12th Doctor would be? Psh, easily the guy who played Aurthor Dent in Hitchhiker's Guide and Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbity
Magic doesn't exist, it's science. Friendship is Science

otakon: Just like in every FPS ever made!
Are those the things junior jedis train on?
He's been sitting there for a year
lel
BY THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP!
And psychic things don't tend to be physical
immune to bullets? just shoot more and put on a better manface
I'm guessing he can do it from within the cage
it'll sort itself out
this seems to be a awesome site :D
What if... somewhere in the series, the TARDIS' ability to change it's appearance is repaired.
hello every one
Twilight_Is_BestPony: *an
I suppose
Hi bigmac
Hey there, Bigcheese
Kandarihu: it would only happen at the VERY end of the series as a whole
FIRST TO SAY HI!
lali-ho Bigcheese
Dat face
Satellites probably focused it or something
88 miles per hour!
Hi guys!
truth be told I probably wouldn't tell if a awesome site was wrong
otakon, there's no way such a thing would happen to a British series, especially this one.
Hey there, Bigcheese
isn't it generally bad form to tell random muggles that time stuff is happening
god I need to watch more of this show
well gtg everypony good luck with your sucky who :D
i am sick today
thanks for teaching me :) and I mean this without any sarcasm. promise
...okay, there's no way it would happen to this series.
Athgaar: Eh, wibbly wobbly.
seeya LoGaN
@bigmac I am sick as well
aw no more saxon on mount rushmore
NORMALITY
lol TDK
cold :(
Deacon: DO EET! Especially the current season, as it's pretty epic!
The Doctor could repair the chameleon circuit
They all undied
Twilight_Is_BestPony, you don't need the @
But he kind of likes it the way it is now
President still dead
^
Eh Obama will take over
Yep
awww
Twilight_Is_BestPony: yeah you dont need @, just start typing a name and press tab to autocomplete
Eddmario but I need BCC channel for the current stuff :(
oh thanks
we MAKE HIM EAT DIRT!
test
dont do eet
Dem eyebrows
Do it!
noi! yo'll create a paradox!
MAKE HIM EAT DIRT
train him!
Oh damn
teach him HMs!
lol
Deacon: http://www.doctorwhomedia.co.uk/ has every Doctor WHo episode that's ever aired that's in Digital form, and they upload the new episodes after they air in the UK
ded
._.
OMG
make him an HM slave
O.o
O_O
or not :/
Too bad the site's down right now though...
NOPE
Master nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ;__;
Welp, Im back, and no longer sleeping in my room tonight since I left to kill a random brown recluse.
Aww, missed all the action?
Eddmario ooh, thanksies
Deacon: Or you could use Netflix to watch everything that's available right now
refuse to regenerate?
Wait
the feels
woah
Eddmario yea, got netflix, but I didn't think it had the newer ones
:'( WHO else will be his evil counterpart?
YES
This Is Gallifrey again
he crossed his eyes before dying
best doctor who music by far
;~;
;_;
T_T
:'(
master ded
damn time
So, they were friends??
though I do like This is the doctor
Or...
Used to be
Its like Vader
RaveBrony: Rivals
Wow. His major nemesis, straight up dead. Wow.
When they were younger
SpeccyRush: o u
Vordox: Ah.
LOL Vader i was thinking the same thing
But he kind of went crazy
And turned evil
Doctor Who is an amazing show
RaveBrony No, mortal enimies. BUt The Doctor is the last Time Lord, so when he found another, he thought he didnt have to be alone anymore
that had respect
RaveBrony: nope....used to be friends, rivals now (or at least until now :'()
Never use to be friends
Haku1013: He says in this ep that they used to be friends
Hmm
Good point
So, timelord really IS a race?? O.i I thought they were chosen or something...
lol
Friends. Rivals. Kindered spirits. Enemies.
Okay, I'm going to start Doctor Who tomorrow. Which Doctor do I start with?
Well that was random
RaveBrony, Species
AssaultWithEmbraces: 1st doctor
I can see why you love the Tennant era so much, Dari.
but yeah
For new Who start with Eccleston
AssaultWithEmbraces, either the first one or the 9th
9th would be the best since it's the reboot
and now this happens
Bronysith, do they still have those episodes?
AssaultWithEmbraces: 1st, it will start with mystery before getting to the action though
AssaultWithEmbraces: have fun trying to find em
RaveBrony, they were a race. But the Doctor is the last of his kind
Do they have episodes of the 1st?
Haku1013: Oh ive seen those things o:
Man, the Doctor should have had a cameo on Torchwood. Hopefully the next season/whatever of Torchwood has a cameo of him...
Kandarihu: Ah, i see.
AssaultWithEmbraces they do but majority of them were lost in the BBC fire back in the 80s
Eddmario well family's mostly been using Mediacom, which means it has to be bought seperately, but I'll just use netflix and that site you gave me, thanks though
dis part
AssaultWithEmbraces: of the first Doctor? Yeah but they're basically lost to history ;_;
Because the war could never end
AssaultWithEmbraces: hold on....i'll pm you with the episode list
This is some good tv
otakon, Zamer, awww :<
Im so damn left out on this.... so many pings explaining ;_;
Poor Jack
otakon most of the 1st episode ever is on youtube
Can you PLEASE stop with that random popping
Some episodes are lost, AssaultWithEmbraces. But the audio is still intact.
The face of Bo
Everyone has seen this! Haha
Dark92Enigma, coool~
face of bo~
Eddmario: it's his ping
face of bo
holyshit
he has the face of my dog?
poping?
Mind = BLOWN!
NO WAY
....the face of.....WAT
mind blown
NO WAY
wow
NO
Eeyup
i love when people learn that.
WAY
MIND=BLOWN!
the face of bo
thank you tv i owe you a lot
HE WAS THE FACE OF BO
......
i dont get it
:(
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN
you know from that second episode
HOLY SHIT
I already knew it
whos bo
Haku1013: he WILL be The Face of Bo
of the very first season
eh nvm
That just blew my mind so hard
My face when I first saw the end of this episode: :O
smooze
wait, so that giant head in the jar is jackie boy?
he IS the face of bo, or at least WILL be
dammit where is a Sumica "WOAH" when you need one?
yup
twilight_squirtle: Looks like were left out on that one :(
So.....he's the face of BO? :'(
eeyup
this revelation http://i.imgur.com/UmpOi.gif
Buytoast: eventually yeah
Buytoast: Well they never really confirm it properly, but that suggests it
if he is the face of boe then that he would die many years later
THE FACE OF BO WAS THE WISEST CREATURE EVER WHO ONLY MET THE DOCTOR TWICE. THE 2ND TIME TO TELL HIM HE WASNT THE LAST TIME LORD.
in a milion years he is
so...the face of Bo?
Just....wow. Damn this show is amazing.
RaveBrony: heh :P
Look at those red shoes
actually otakon they have not officially stated if he would become Boe, they just thrue that in as a joke
Wait a minute. The Face of Bo eventually died, right?
Haku1013 ah
Kandarihu: Yup
Yay
Yes he does die
Haku1013, actually three times
Good guy is undeded
thx for the explanation Haku1013
lol
Deacon eeyup. Just a big head in a big jar.
Obsidian: and it's a Heroic Sacrifice at taht
Hah!!
ye the Face of bo gave the last of his energy to save people, and told the doctor that there was another Time Lord
AGATHA CRISTIE
<3
I LOVE THAT EPISODE
Why did I not start watching this earlier?!
;_;
stop leaving the doctor :'(
Eventualy the Face of Bo does dies, so that means that Jack DOES dies sooner or later
yup
The Doctor is now SINGLLLLLLLE
ladies~
episode before catherine tate character?
AssaultWithEmbraces: i asked the same question a year ago.....
yeah, he should blow up the world just to try it. you know:)
eyup
y u leave Tennant, the man is a sexy beast.
Donna is better
O.o
time for new assistant
what ?
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Tennant
Haku1013 they never officially stated that Jack would become Boe, alluded to but never confirmed
thus the search for another companion continues
nvm
Roses' departure isn't actually that sad
Zamer good point
Well, it is for the Doctor
AND THEN HE MET THE 5TH DOCTOR
so it's all fan assumption
But for her it's good
and back
i almost wanted a chav doctor that WOULD be hilarious
Thats the only Doctor ive seen, what are the others like? O____o
I like how all of his companions get their own themes
dat break-up
*a
Get some Hagen-das ready, Tennant
oooooooh she's out
Hah, would be cool
RaveBrony, the earliers were older
well look older
O.o
Ive seen a guy in a scarf, lol
RaveBrony all the Doctors are awesome
but only 1 ep
yeah each time he has a new body he's younger
RaveBrony that was the 4th Doctor
Ah yes, the 4th
Which Doctor is this one?
FORESHADOWING
ring~
the 4th doctor has a ridiculously long scarf
10th
11
ok gotta dash, see ya all tomorrow

I MEANT TO SAY BOOP xD
D:
Nah. I'm not even gonna paste what he said
oh well
it just striked me as queer
little mistake >.>
So I saw Stephanie Buscema last night. I got a few comics signed.
Big mistake Twilight_Is_BestPony
a very unusual name
Well, it's feminine, shaggy. Fits with the streamer's gender.
little mistake :3
Big moistake.
little mistake
:3
slightly larger than tiny mistake :3
I'll make it a big mistake in a minute.
I also have a cahier with her art on it, so I'm going to have her draw in it at future conventions and such.
ok its still very... erm odd to me. not saying its not a good one though
Genders on the Internet? I thought you were all crazy voices in my head'
/me tosses a pie in Jmo's face
13queer?
I liek appel pies
Here we go.
(Stephanie Buscema did the cover art for th MLP comic)

/me pulls up a chair for Jmo, AdamThePsyduck and myself
Doesn't shizuka mean quiet, though?
dafuq am I watching nao
no offense >.>
I just dont know
13coming from someone who named themselves shaggy?
This is only an intro, Twilight_Is_BestPony
okay
/me passes AssaultWithEmbraces the popcorn
Remember "Something Queer" mysteries?
well you have a point:)
/me buys some skittles for the show
Gwen taps her braces!
Shizuka: olei
i should be less judgemental
"Something Queer a the Library"
That balloonicorn. It's SO DAMN CUTE
And now a show
nice intro
Let the stream begin!
A very... introspective show.
Shizuka: so winged peoples again?
I guess?
why do you guys not know what queer means?
we dont want to know shaggy
shaggy: we do it just doesn't bother us
doesnt queer mean weird?
shaggy: even those who fit that stupid label
aww...shame I can't stay up much longer - :) I'll be back early in the morning with insomnia, of that I'm certain :) Goodnight All
night Cypresswolf sleep well
shaggy: why are you talking about it?
Bye, Cy
Goodnight Cypresswolf
Good evening everypony.
Cypresswolf: See ya
what is this show called?
Hello there Canadian_Brony
Bye, Canadian_Brony
Oh, taking inventory?
yes queer = odd or weird
Also, Sumica is in this show o_O

Cause there can be
Is this like Atlantis from that whatchamacallit game?

I need to wreck my damned desk and build a new one :(
Polydunami: you mean before Cosmo sank Atlantis 9 times
lel
No no, I was looking it up. The Journeyman Project 3
HEEEEEY ITS A STREAM :)
I can never remember that game
Journeyman rules!
13re volume, i would turn on leveling but it tends to overcompensate a lot
how is everyone?
13so haruhi after this, ease into higher volume
Right
Are there only females as angels? No wait, I see males now
The volume is fine for me
it's a little low for me
Do the Haibane never age?

but I have it down load
Low for me too, but I have headphones so they'll be lowuder for me then
suddenly a confused shaggy appears. aren't we watching stuff or did we stop

GODDAMMIT INTERNET STOP SLOWING DOWN WHEN SHIZUKA IS STREAMING
Push play, shaggy
shaggy: refresh

Polydunami: doing just great

Is the deadline already passed?
Are you saying good night, Athgaar?

13you didn't see ep 1 then
13you don't start with them, they burst out first
sounds painful..
so they are not in heaven
13it was
plus wings would be bad if you get caught bear a plane
Yeah, the Haruhi episodes didn't run in order.
then where did the halo come from
13from a bagel press
lol
you mean it wasn't frmo donuts Shizuka
As long as chat is quiet, Is anyone here going to be going to Anime Detour in MN in april?
bagel press halos
the next breakfast item
I like bagels
lol, what are donuts6_9
they're light halos that's why they float, much less carbs than normal halos
shaggy . . . wat
you don't know what donuts are?
its pronounced bagel
or danish
Okay I'm back. I'll be here after all :3
oh well, i tried.
pronunctiation doesnt work on the internet without voice
true
Pronunciation?
not used to chat rooms sorry
Hello Bronystate. How's everyone today?
Hey there, Silver_Soother
hello Silver_Soother
I'm well
there should be different styles of text for pronounciation, like "Sarcastia"
ello everypony, what we watching?
Good to hear Polydunami :)
hey Silver_Soother. Tired and hungry, as per usual.
hi LunaRoyalGuard. No clue, not watching it
Hey there, LunaRoyalGuard, see the bottom of the stream
but what are donuts? are the types of bagels?
well now i want a doughnut, thank you very much chat
Canadian_Brony: I know how that feels. Just add bordem to the list and it's complete.
that's a cool word Canadian_Brony ... "sarcastia"
Woo, Avast! updated.
And I need to update Malwarebytes
Big_Macintosh_1992 IKR? Totally gonna make that a font some day
Welcome to the wonderful republic of Sarcastia :|
Been a while since I've been here. What's with VEEMI being a streaming provider?
temped to change my name to "Sarcastian_Brony"
13because mips sucks
you know what, that was a stupid question. i can just google it:)
just cuz :p
short version Silver_Soother stuff happend
Silver_Soother: The last stream mips was hacked
long story short: HAX! HAAAAAAAX!!!
hack =/= hijack
I see. Thanks for the responses everyone. :3
whats the conflict of this story
did I lose connection or did it just get really quiet?
Silver_Soother: It happened twice for a few minutes during the last new episode stream
It's supposed to be a slice of life kind of story, shaggy
Kind of like Seinfeld but with a different kind of atmosphere
AlienWarhead: I see, so I'm guessing Veemi is more secure?
Also, it has a story
Polydunami: Interesting way to put it, I like it.
ah, so it has lots depression huh
Not at the beginning, no
not my cup of tea
I need an admin to like... kick Big_Macintosh_1992 (me) so I can log back in. I lost connection and now it says my name is already in use
im more of a happy ending kind of person
Guys, I think I'm broken
Silver_Soother: We'll find out on Saturday, but seriously I'm sure this is more secure
/me fixes Brother_Aura
pony1234 Big_Macintosh_1992 is gone
I don't ship rarityxspike ._.
Just wait a few minutes and you'll be back pony1234 if that happens.
ok, thanks
pony1234: /nick <new_nick>
ohai MakerDusk
spin
AlienWarhead: Hoping it is too. Been wanting to watch MLP on here... Haven't yet, I'm a bad brony. :P
:3
I don't ship rarityxspike ._.
oh, nice music
also, a kick isn't good enough, you need a /kill or to ghost the nick if you have it registered
hello Canadian_Brony
Silver_Soother: It's ok I'm sure you're a good brony:)
ah, I'm back.
You can use /nick Big_Macintosh_1992
good to have you
Oh dear
AlienWarhead: I like to think so. I've helped one of my friends get into MLP. So I must be doing something right.
/me brohoofs Silver_Soother
oh dear yes
Is this the right one?
/me brohoofs AlienWarhead
Polydunami: it wouldn't have let me i don't think, wouldn't let me connect as me and It's password protected
this was a very interesting anime. and i love it
forcing your friends into liking something is not good
Big_Macintosh_1992: of course you can
oh
I'd change nicks, but then I'd get alerts in many channels and be flooded with pms for the rest of the night >_<
/me blames you!
>_>
oh lord
it's Haruhi
Buytoast: Dunno if you mean me, but I didn't force them into it. I sent them a link to an episode and they liked it. They asked me questions on it and I answered.
I don't trust her
MakerDusk when in doubt: blame Saxy
MakerDusk: blames... me?
Big_Macintosh_1992: you, the users
plural
XD
it's 1234
Well I just beat sticker star like 10 minuetes ago

hey bronies did you know that trixie is returning to ponyville?
Shh
Insert slowpoke gif here
spoilers~
Hi
stahp lying sugarponi872
oh boy
13actually, the anthropic principle is more like "we see the universe contains the conditions to evolve life, precisely because it evolved life
sugarponi872: but spoilers arent allowed so shh
I only got kicked when I say the word or phase of the day like fight club
i don't think i've seen a more blatant rule violation other than youtube links
:s
Shizuka: Put simply, "This impression fits me perfectly," said the puddle. "It must have been created just for me."
I like cheese
that one takes the cake better than Encyclopedia Brown
youtube links of spoilers during streams :o
I assume I cant se the stream again but there is one?
Somtimes I dream about cheese
ultimate rule breakage
13it's a pretty simple axiom
can I have a cookie?
CCCP: Yes there is a stream
13"the universe supports life because we're obviously here"
AlienWarhead well may you please tell me what it is? :)
Shizuka: And the universe has conditions perfect for our existence because our existence means the conditions are correct for it.
I want a cookie!
CCCP: haruhi suzumiya try refreshing till you see it
Shizuka: Hence the danger of assuming that the universe was created for our benefit.
Sometimes I wish I could have a tea party with fluttershy! =D
13yep
either im missing something, or that theory is a noshitsherlock theory
how does that cab driver not think those kids are insane!?
AlienWarhead no i won't be able to, streams rarely work for me. :P
or that philosophy i guess
twilight_squirtle: You'd be surprised how many people don't realize it.
CCCP oh sorry
So did you find Twilight Sparkle in the MLP Comics yet?
DocSane: how, we're alive, so obviously life can exist
AlienWarhead it's not your fault! lol
/me hugs twilight_squirtle :)
CCCP: 6_9
/me hugs CCCP :)
twilight_squirtle: It's the people who use that as "proof" that an intelligence created the universe for our benefit.
:3
Haruhi == rational? That just makes my day :D
DocSane is this a religious conversation? :s
CCCP: philosophical
CCCP: No, just using that as an example of what happens when you don't consider the anthropic principle.
hey guys I heard that spike has a crush on rarity!
lies
:3
sugarponi872: :O
sugarponi872 SSSHHHT! *whispers* who told you?
DocSane: i dont see the connection of that theory to god, how does it prove it wasnt an accident
sugarponi872: You don't say????
DocSane Oh :P whats that mean? :S
Hi sugarponi872
oh, hey guys, are we watching this in chronological or air-date order?
matrix?
13chronological
13ep 5
thnx Shizuka
twilight_squirtle: Consider what I said about the puddle assuming the depression it sits in as being created for it, because it fits so perfectly.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Simple PMV: Keep drifting / Dumb Ways To Die / Affirmation
Chaos?
DocSane: but it doesnt fit perfectly, and who says we fit perfectly, i dont think its so perfect, earth will get destroyed at some point
THE FUCK
Well, then
hi otakon
SpadeKyurem[School]: lol I thought that too
So when she gets pissed off she destroys reality
lovely
looks like a angel
it's PMS over 9000
13blossom! bubbles! buttercup noooooooo!
Did you know that My Little Pony began in the 80's?
So we have a emotionally unstable gd
13koizumi wants to be a powerpuff tooooooo
*god
SpadeKyurem[School]: basically and she doesn't even know it
That bodes well
sugarponi872: Eeyup
13well that was easy
sugarponi872 Im not trying to sound rude but honestly... who doesnt know that?
at least our god is hot
Shizuka: yeah inb4 they get their asses kicked
twilight_squirtle: Just saying that some look at the fact the universe supports life as prrof that it was created for our benefit, as opposed to we having arisen because its supported conditions for our existence.
Dont mind the possibly hundreds people dead
SpadeKyurem[School]: pocket universe, they're fine
^
DocSane: k thx for explaining
he should have taken the red pill
I wanna be a pegasus!
or "Closed Space" in this case
And the cab driver says nothing
DocSane are you now talking about inteligent design?
13cab driver's like "maaan these guys are higher than me right now"
^
HA
sugarponi872: I want to be a unicorn
:D
Cab drivers are payed to drive not ask questions
CCCP: Again, just talking about the anthropic principle and its implications.
Cab driver must be a robot
DocSane But what does that even mean?!!!
CCCP: Am I not being clear?
Hey guys Spongebob told me that 2+2=4!
2+2=fish
DocSane oh sorry i didnt see your last post my chat is having some problems
2+2=fish
o damn

Japan seems to be full of shit that can wreck reality
Shizuka: I guess but damn if I was in that situation I'd be scared shiless.
i have never seen this Anime before
Can i have a cookie?

Why is Sombra obsessed with stairs
i love how in everything the school bell is consistent.
Yeah I'm not dead Canadian_Brony I'm just really really really really quiet :P

He slaughtered hundreds of mooks for a fucking cake.

silly Polydunami, learn to catch with your hooves, not your face :p
SpadeKyurem[School]: Someone stole my cake? Welp, better go on a murdering spree to find out who!
unless you have a super-long tongue..
/me uses LICK. It's super-effective!
what would happen if Kirby swallowd Death?
What I dont get is why the cake was stolen in the first place
CCCP: Death Kirby?
I mean the squeaks are treasure hunters
SpadeKyurem[School]: To troll Kirby?
why is a computer the first logical place to look for a doll
13SpadeKyurem[School]: suiseiseki trolled hina ichigo
AJIsHaunter but would he die?
13PrincessLuna: screensaver is on, therefore she didn't move anything to hide there

00,10So whats with all the humanised pegasisisisisisis?
angels
it's anime, but I haven't been paying attention
Heaven looks dull
SpadeKyurem[School]: Even if a woodchuck could chuck wood and a woodchuck WOULD chuck wood, I doubt that a woodchuck would chuck any amount of wood.
Flash-sideways: The Series
seems legit
00,10Hmmm i should queue up to finish that clif hanger from earlyer
Heaven has electricity?

Heaven has crows.

AJIsHaunter: why is that bad that game is awesome
13kuu's halo fell off, she's gone on

Angels can die?
twilight_squirtle: lol

SpadeKyurem[School]: then thay go to super heven

Moved on
00,10oh I know this song

13the series implies that the world of the haibane is a sort of purgatory, but doesn't explicitly state it
Kuu ascended
AJIsHaunter: wold i be a dick if a loled
INVISIBLE DESK CHAIR

BMN is not for everyone, admittedly....
DeathStar: oki doki loki
Kurra: Well, whichever one you prefer is the better option you can do first and then do the second option later. :3
Kurra, all it is are 2 movies, you don't need to be a brony to enjoy a movie.

Sorry guys! Think I'll go get blanket hoofies and smooches X3

*seasons
00,10and then it turned in to a harum anime
a star shaped mole??
What'll happen over again? :S
so she actually created a new world? cuz my internet died for a minute
The end of the canon as of the end of the first series was slooow
So Mikuru's a tool for Haruhi? :S
twilight_squirtle1: I'm guessing they just returned to the old world.
k
EIther that or the new world was based off the old world.
13the rest of the series is slice of life
this show is wierd
In a way, Shizuka, yes
00,10one very crroked slice
my mind just went hjskfzjldfsnzaghf
geeky have you watched Eva?
heh eva
PrincessLuna: no
Daaaaaaaaaammmmmn that sudden jump again
Goodness, Rozen Maiden is LOUD.
Man i love this intro <3
00,10so either dot hack or that one with the dolls judgeing by the music
Why does this intro remind me of Code Geass?
dolls
Shizuka: so did haruhi actually create a new world after he kissed her? my internet died a bit there
Dolls.
PrincessLuna: well it make go full retard like the last show just did
AdamThePsyduck: because its sung by the same band
00,10desu desu desudesudesu
13twilight_squirtle: we'll never know
Shizuka: oh wow, ok
chat can't stay sit too watch dot hack Sumica too slow for them sadly
geeky: depends on how you take the ending
00,10yeah i know TheGreatAndPowerfulT, I tryed
13dot hack is like an MMO right?
PrincessLuna: then ill more than like go full retard
AdamThePsyduck: sung by eli project, i looked them up yesterday, they have some neat creative songs

Wow
I just saw the worst facebook status
This is slice of life but with sentient and intelligent dolls.
PrincessLuna: i saw parts of the eva rebuild movies. theyre pretentious as hell, but its an enjoyable mindbuck and the music is awesome, as well as style and animation
im so confused
00,10roll for stealth
It said "Hey. Do you. Brush Your Teeth? Like If You Do!"
You'd think Yuki could consult the Data Integrated Thought ENtity, or Mikuru could try checking for another time fault to be sure, though.
twlight_squirtle: watch the series, but i cant say itll explain much more
13SHINKU PAWNCH

13not as powerful as the crocodile of truth though
it shall peirce your soul
hi
it has +3 honesty though Shizuka
with the drills of truth
cant really spell sry
Shizuka: your strem is raping my mind
13and like haibane
13the plot has arrived
Well, then.
and like haibane, only took 6 eps
Its a trap
Again, this is a bit too much pacing
13i like their pacing
ep6 too... it's a pattern
13you get to know the characters, and then the world goes to hell
i cant stand this pacing tbh..
da hell
13it's like how half life starts with a normal day at work, or doom 3 starts with normal mars
apple
13you learn the world, then it breaks
Except that happens pretty quickly
i dont think it should take 6 eps to show the world though
go to mars they said, no horrible things could possibly happen they said
welp, gonna go to sleep, night everyone :)
if done well, can be done in 1-2 eps
nite thelonecubone
night thelonecubone
