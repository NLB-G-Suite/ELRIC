Bold allowed?
Lolno.
08,01so announcements are easier if people can actually see us
>colors
Derpy Thing is nothing that makes you highlighted over any other users when you aren't a mod is not allowed
Simple as that
08,01Derpy: we believe in the fine principle of apartheid
G2g
08,01we separate the coloured folk from the non-coloured folk.

08,01 i really want to include the phrase "colloqually known as 'the arse end of Fife'" in my report...
08,01because that's where i was teaching, basically
08,01pretty much bottom rung
05Saturn!

and it would be fantastic
05or i can do this...
Saturn IKR
08,01and i *LOVE* the choker!
Chockers like that need a little bell though
08,01Chrysalis: hehehehe
or a pendant
/me 08,01has a hting for chokers, if you couldn't guess
Saturn i do too
I got my girlfriend into wearing one, best decision ever
08,01really obsessed
08,01everything in our flat was cowprint
MOOO
Nice
Goddamn home network randomly disconnecting my phone and shit
08,01i didn't realise that it came with a choker with a little bell
:D
Saturn NICE
08,01she wore it, came out, and i pretty much fucking pounced on her
Swedish metal is just awsome:P
understandable
Literal cowgirl! :$
Saturn thats not too bad
08,01lots of sex was had that night
08,01lots.
Awesome :D
iv got my current/previous girlfriends to do MUCH worse
08,01oh, if we're talking about *worst* things we've got partners to do...
08,01i have a list.
lol
08,01nevaaar!
08,01but yeah, we can continue this in THE OTHER CHANNEL
oooh basscleff pendant <3
lol
08,01wink wink
other channel?
08,01nudge nudge
that channel scares me
euch, my old chemistry teacher used to call me napalm
08,01that is just TOO CUTE
08,01Chrysalis: because you're flaming and sticky?
/me 08,01falls off his chair laughing
well it was close to my real name
annoyingly
it stuck
hey-oooo!
has called me napalm
08,01i'm gonna go with my expanation, hun
but she made it a challenge
08,01oh yeah, you guessed it.
and this is our floor manager
napalm
we dont need no floor
and i kinda melted the glass tube... and the floor.
and yeah.
:D
serriously, bad behaviour + top set = BAD THINGS
and unfortunately, we worked togetehr
Saturn you glad i suggested bell/pendant?
hey, that looks like the collar i bought my sl...
nvm.
cause i sure am
08,01i am
08,01anyhoos, back to work
work is boring
took the afternoon off
seriously, an afternoon on a thursday does WONDERS
wait ive heard the song some where before
08,01urgh
08,01what's a tactful way of saying "an area that is rough, poor, and shitty"?
Stream ded?
Saturn: degraded?
08,01well, i'm looking more for a phrase than a word
*for me
No, wait
Works now
:D
an area of social decline
08,01Chrysalis: thank you!
;)
08,01"Kirklands High School is based in Methil, an area of Fife where the population are not generally well-off, and may be considered to be in social decline."
an area with little developmental appeal , except maybe for organized crime
good pye paycheck
08,01i think well-off might be too colloquial...
Saturn: good sentence though
are generally considered below the poverty line?
Saturn: Perhaps you should try "where the population face economic difficulties"?
need to show they are affected more than most
could be conciderd aslum
This song is sooo wtf >.>
08,01"Kirklands High School is based in Methil, an area of Fife where a lot of the population are near the poverty line, which may be considered to be in social decline." <-- nailed it
half of that was written by me!
08,01heh, aye

05J_E_Smith71: no talkign about anythign related to unaired eps

05that includes eventual comics portrayign the plot of said eps
Yeah, but the mask salesman i creepyer than the statue i think XD

08,01who fancies doing some more proof reading for me?
/me 08,01is crowdsourcing
Saturn, I would, but I'm too sleepy :$
08,01http://du.cx/pics/u0U6ip.png
proof reading as in grammar and spelling?
08,01AdamTheDuck: i do, aye
08,01i'll probably be citing it in this report
Saturn: sure, as long as I'm not being solely relied upon as I'm feeling a little unreliable
08,01heh, aye; i just need a second pair of eyes on it
anyway, back to reading
wouldn't it be a constructivist?
I only wish i could do something like this but i dont have the talent for it all my artisc talent is in music
Saturn: "for real" seems to be a bit informal...
i want to be graphic in future :o
but everybody telling me that i wont find a job
^
I wish I could draw :<
Sometimes corny is still good :D
but i ment every word of it
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Microtransaction / Project
hai everyone
Saturn: and maybe it would help to say "and which may be considered..." to help with the flow
Ahhh
and that all really anyone can hope for man
bye thx for tips :)
60 to 90 mins
oh
05pretty much
Hey everypony
05howssat?
Toasty
is SAI free ?
liking the equaliser
welp nvm
little to the left
it's zoomed out you silly scot
08,01otakon: i know that
08,01Wrek: it is? i swear it looked smalled than that earlier
08,01did he?
08,01oh!
00,10yeah
08,01right, yes, i remember!
sorry
05haha
xD
Saturn: PM
05paintool
05ran out of memory
00,10lol
00,10you got as much system memory as I do
00,10then again you also maxed out layers again did't you
it looks amazing right now ;w;
00,10meh
05yeah
05backround is only 12 layers
05vinyl herself is 240ish
05this is 100% zoom
Saturn, oh you :D
geez
I haven't even used 6 gig yet. Then again, I haven't been using painttools and such
08,01oh shit, i'm getting distracted again
08,01only got 1.5 hours until i need to submit
08,01and i have about 1000 words to write
Saturn: Any more to proofread?
Saturn: Good luck with that.
Saturn: you got this
i haven't even filled 4 gigs with ae & ps
well guess they use swap too
and hdd
I haven't even filled 3 TB with all my crap yet.
I have a 1tb hard drive, used about 200 gig
Mostly games
I have 3 TB total, using around 2.5 TB.
there goes my flashplayer again
Maybe I should wipe them at some point.
05hahahaha
Chrst, I remember when 1tb ExHD's costed 5000 quid in 2006
05memory errors
Oh wow.
As in size.
huh, my hdd is only 120GB
I mean on the disk.
That is fairly large.
my 1tb drive is nearly half full
can't wait until 1TB SSDs
its like blue turd fireworks :O
i have most of my data on the externals
whoops 2 tb of course
I use 1 TB for films and TV shows alone, and that's not even on this desktop.
i download films from my tv
05aprox....
Anytime my drive goes over 300 gig used, it's usually used for temperoary files
0516x11 inches maybe?
05had it been on paper
Waaahhh
Dayuuum
Alrighty, thanks.
05so its roughtly printable on an A3
05Saturn
Like I said, I'm off next year
05if my rough math is correct
NICE
08,0116x11, aye
08,01and A3 is about that
08,01300
/me recently added third TB external
00,10aprocheing 200gigs worth of pony
Heh, my drive is only 200 gig used u
up*
05let me chech
And it's because of games and such
05its currently using 3gb of mem
00,10primary is 750gm
00,10er gb
05out of the 3gb reserved
05save file itself
Oh wow.
05lets check
Main drive is 500gb, secondary is 500gb
It runs on RAID
Also, it came with it
08,01Chrysalis: raided SSD = fastest
00,10Ewww SSD
Saturn not really
not much faster than normal ssd
Mines SATA
slow FSB :(
08,01Chrysalis: yes it is
Hm. I only have ~77 GB of pony.
Wait, SATA II
00,10SSD does not balence cost to size well
08,01Chrysalis: striping increases parallelism
05here goes
05its 1.142.168Kb
05which is
/me headbangs
05...
I'd get an SSD, but right now I'm more concerned about size than speed.
1GB:O
05help me convert that to gigs
steam= 199GB in 185967 files
051.1 roguhtly yes?
08,01you won't do that with a single drive
05kB*
00,10dont care how fast it is if it's not large enough for many games to even install directly on to
05ok yeah Saturn
05the file itself
05is
051.08GB
and keep all the backups on my HDD
08,01i've not kept right up to date, though
00,10yeah as i said I care more for storage then speed
kB? OK, then yeah 1.142GB
00,10when the cost to size comes down I till think about geting SSD's
I beleive my drives are 2gb/s
no loading screens on any games
except PS2
05if i get an SSD for gaming? ill keep only my most played games on it
but ssds break faster if you writ on them a lot
00,10PS 2 is one of my fastist loading games
00,104sec from play to hud
00,10and frankly that's plenty fast for me
08,01for nominal (4kb) block size random reads, it's much slower
also, MC on an SSD is godly
00,10oh good they are bringing back the AMAS system to gal's soon™
PS 2 is demanding, that's why
08,01>loses
08,01:P
I play like 3 of them.
08,01Chrysalis: i did not, actually
08,01i'm sure you told me at some point, but i forgot
Systems programmer for Barcrest
00,10because you dont uninstall
08,01or engineering
00,10they are magic
*snort snort*
08,01Sumica: it's common knowledge that all electronics work on the principle of magic smoke
power goes in magic comes out
00,10and a serise of tubes
you can release the magic blue smoke
08,01if you abuse them, the magic smoke escapes, and the device no longer works
<3 we both made the same reference
08,01clearly, we are made for each other
Computers are like magnets.
this is the best most intelligent thing i heared all week
Saturn: Thats CT logic
00,10nah computeres hate magnets
00,10clearly they are opposing classes of magic
Saturn: wat
oh wow
i would still be at work normally
<3 afternoons off
Crossovers are Decade's fault! :D http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/285/841/c05.jpg

05Saturn: if you do that can you print otehrs aswell?
08,01Wrek: we spend a lot at our print shop; might be able to organise a discount for you
05and
05like
05remove the need for me to bring the pritns with me when i come
05i can even let you in on profits...
05xD
08,01Wrek: well, yes, but that means *i'd* need to bring them then

I really need to get to sleep a bit earlier.
the book
not the series
they released a gmae too right?
sucked
Most tv show/movie games suck
nah
I've seen Brainscratch's run of it. I loved it. :D
<.<
the fans demanded it be released early
before they had time for proper completion
The physics were nonexistent
I heard Sega wanted it out for christmass
not the fans
hey
Hay
<.<
https://www.humblebundle.com/
hm?
hey
Yeah?
I know of some underrated games!
underrated games?
tales of symphonia
Custom Robo.
Same goes to Luigi's Mansion.
people hate it cause there brain cant handle switching between chracters
oh no i have gamecube version
The ps2 version has horrible framerate
I had a great time with Digimon 4 as well.
oh yea
still
legend of dragoon is incredibly underrrated
How about Skies Of Arcadia?
YES.
The gameplay kinda sucked
Kinda?
dont make me laugh
The morality choice was non existent
It wasn't a problem to me.
i also think majoras mask is underrated
underrated to other zelda games
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFMCVI0iTAo
well i still hate it
I mean I wont fault you, unless you actually think its good designed
okay i still like the 06 version but it dosent hold a candle to the orginal
YET THEY RELEASE A VERSION WITH IT ON IT
The fuck!
I dont see the issue with the Werehog really
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVCvqT4qKi0
In fact, I had a pretty good time with the Werehog segments.
I still find it stupid to have like 10 different endings but only one of the paths is cannon
...Am I the only one that sort of liked those levels? [FLAME SHIELD ENGAGED]

mhm
:'(
I crie every tiem
O,_,O
wat acting, i crie evertim
Holla everypony! :)
Blaze: apparently I can't see that
You're forgetting River Song
River Song was the only character I watched for after Tennant left
well it's a good thing they had a lot of river song episodes
Its only gone both ways a few times
Blaze: except for river song
or maybe rose
bah
Rose was definitely both ways
:O
She didnt get the real Docotr
'it wants to be held'
This quote
all those references
Rose was "both ways" with the doctors.
Blaze: hmm
its an invasion
Jack had a crush on everything
ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun
yeah and we both know that Jack crushed on everyone
Jack was gay, butwe only saw him a few times in this show
dari, Jack WANTED to crush everything.
Jack was both ways
Jack was awesome
he flirted with EVERYONE
why are we speaking in the past tense
with EVERYTHING
he was ready to die a fwe minutes ago
why not now
I loved Jack's humor. I didn't like how much he flirted
He was a good character
Dari, Ellecsion or Tennant?
I dont want to go
;:'(
I want a "The 13 Doctors" special
Eccleston wasn't it?
:'(
yeah he spelled it wrong
yawn
:'(
Definitely a tearjerker, this episode was
so...you come here often?
I would show my feels, but dari is watching o_o
Doctor's Wife - That episode rocked
you know, that lady looks like Smith in a wig
Tennant = Our "4th Doctor"
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the only thing to remember in this episode is the watch really
Hahaha
inb4 kick?
Now THAT is harsh
Then take it all away from him
Yeah thats pretty fucked up
and then SNATCH IT AWAY
yep
Cool!
lol "everyone safe"
So....uh...what's happening?

He died. GREAT.
He even references the name 'Mr. Smith' a few times later on
just do it you wimp

Rowan Atkinson was awesome
Dari, is Smith THAT bad?
Pfft

Smith is my personal fave. It's very close between him and Tennant, but he just barely wins
:3

We'll see
And, I missed te TARDIs...
To the future

yes
He can't die
He's not immortal
looks like a good time to me!
HYOOOOOOMAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNN
Well, I suppose he can't be killed
Is more accurate
He can die, he just comes back about a minute later
But, spoilers
Thing is , if you stream Utopia , you kinda have to stream "the sound of drums" and "last of the timelords" as well , dont you ?
(;
HUUUUUMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANN!
hehehe
brb
Dagh
well unless the allusions to him actually being the Face of Boe
There is a subtle difference. In his case. He can die. He can even be killed. It just plain doesn't take.
is real
but shhh

Ign seems to think otherwise...
Not that I listen to Ign anyway
i dont even listen to IGN

Bye guys :)

CrystalPheonix: It's still his opinion
AAAA Tennant <3
To me, the BEST games ever are the most influential and enjoyable, not the most profitable and biggest.
Yep
FUN
Wait a second...THIS IS A DABI STREAM?!
for example, going back to EVE, yes, it can be a grind, and there are ALOT of things that feel like a second job, ie. Diplomacy, HOWEVER, just like PS2 EVE is best played with friends and not alone :)
Mebbe
>_>
<_<
no matter how you can catch it
Dabi bby :3

its pronounced bagel
Okay I'm back. I'll be here after all :3

Pronunciation?
I'm well
there should be different styles of text for pronounciation, like "Sarcastia"
Woo, Avast! updated.

Been a while since I've been here. What's with VEEMI being a streaming provider?
temped to change my name to "Sarcastian_Brony"

Kuu ascended

with the drills of truth
13and like haibane
13the plot has arrived
Well, then.
and like haibane, only took 6 eps
Its a trap
Again, this is a bit too much pacing
13i like their pacing
ep6 too... it's a pattern
i cant stand this pacing tbh..
apple
13you learn the world, then it breaks
Except that happens pretty quickly
i dont think it should take 6 eps to show the world though
go to mars they said, no horrible things could possibly happen they said
welp, gonna go to sleep, night everyone :)
if done well, can be done in 1-2 eps
