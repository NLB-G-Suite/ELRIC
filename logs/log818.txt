0,5Wat?
But I like fiddle songs D:
08,01Dark92Enigma: for it not to be a vapid word-repeating childish jaunt
BaconMane: hi!
0,5I didn't say anything >_>
BaconMane: ok ;)
08,01Bronysith: it was less than half-arsed
08,01it was quarter-arsed
08,01and that's being generous.
08,01except the fiddle in it
08,01that was cool.
https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6900657408/h677F2741/ how i see the moon
Dark92Enigma: it was just this "raise this barn, raise this barn, 1 2 3 4, raise this barn"
thats the whole song
maybe it was infinitesimally-arsed
08,01to be fair, the fiddle was awesome
08,01and not many other kids' cartoons will actually have a real fiddle in a song
they got the same devs and everything
Bronysith ok, point taken. :S
i admit it
08,01JRP2234: a nice thought, but i'll bet you the new one will be rubbish; i just have visions of DNF all over again...
Nittany_Discord: interesting, is there some kind of name for these symbols that I can google?
08,01Bronysith: i'll bring anything into anything
Hey everypony
/me 08,01brings a lion into a bar
08,01the barman says "you can't leave that lion there"
so is it just random images right now
08,01and i say, "that's not a lion, it's a giraffe"
08,01and the barman says "you're in the wrong joke, mate"
08,01so i take the lion, and try to find the correct joke
08,01we set out on an epic quest, through the metaverse of humour
08,01we run into many foes and tribulations along the way
08,01but also make new friends
so are we just showing a slide show right now?
jcelios: http://tornado.sfsu.edu/geosciences/classes/m201/WeatherMapAnalysis/wxmap.jpg
08,01though we end up back home eventually, the journey has changed us, and we will never be the same, innocent and inexperienced children we once were
08,01*ba dum tsh*
true
rcman914: yup
/me 08,01has the best extended metaphors
Welp. Off to my parents' place for a few days. If I don't come back, it's safe to presume the flu finally got me. Otherwise I'll see y'all near the end of the week.
Nittany_Discord: oooh neat! thanks

Bronysith: kat

Bronysith: first of all when u get ur vita. DO NOT UPDATE
cachi01: can i still install my final fantasy 6-8 on it?
And secondly, I thought the Vita didn't have Backwards compatibility
Bronysith: u bought them online?

cachi01: final fantasy 6 7 and 8 on the PSN
Bronysith: then yes
cachi01: i can do that without updating?
BerryPunch has been demoted :(

cachi01: so i do that after i get the exploit then?
jcelios: Laaaayyyyte

yea
facehoof
god
milking much square enix?
cachi01 slowpoke
Deacon pls i was the 3rd to comment on the ign trailer
lel
anyways, The only games ill be playing on my vita are, persona 4 golden, Final fantasy 6-8 and chrono trigger when i buy it
Bronysith: good man
and Legend of dragoon if its playable on it
Bronysith: its square enix, of course they're milking it
jcelios: so far, i dont like final fantasy 8 as much as 7 or 6
Bronysith: its way different
cowvarkian: yea, i miss square soft T~T
jcelios: the magic system is balls
HAHAHAHAHA
lelwat
LT Data got stuck in a chinese finger trap
HAHAHAHAHA
Bronysith: totally, probably the worst square's ever done XD
until the next game
was FF8 that bad?
I really like it, but the magic system is bad
Deacon: the magic system is way different, the story is meh, and the characters arent as likeable as 6 or 7
ill be honest, people are way too hard on Cloud...even though he does DREAD AND FUCKING ANGST
i mean Dart Feld pretty much went through the same shit, and even then some, and he doesnt dread or angst
those sound like things that would make one hate a character
in fact he just pulls a kamina and moves on
Bronysith same thing for cecil
cowvarkian: yea, but cloud did go through a lot of shit and at one point believed his entire life was a lie
im too tired to finish my song
Deacon: which final fantasy is that?
4
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: "Apple Family Reunion": Episode Followup
/me has never played a final fantasy game
^
cowvarkian: final fantasy 7 is a great introductory final fantasy
cowvarkian: after you beat that, play final fantasy 6
5 is also a good start, gameplay wise though
when I was little I thought the gun blade was the most ingenious idea ever... combining a gun and a sword? how awesome is that!? Sigh lol
you're making it sound like I'm ever going to play a final fantasy game
which I'm not
Deacon: are 4 and 5 on the PSN?
Hey guys~
Ohai Ponies47 :)
ohai Ponies47
Ohai Ponies47 :)
yo Ponies47
hello Ponies47
Bronysith iirc, yea
Deacon: so many games to play on my vita
hai Ponies47
cachi01: if only there was a larger library for the vita though....ah well, persona 4 golden makes it worth while
cause JRPGs are usually great games
cause you are guarentted at least 100 hours of gameplay, story wise of course
Bronysith though it be better to download ff4 complete, it has the original game with overhauled grafics, and a sequel
*graphics
Deacon: aight
though i really dont care for graphics, if its 16 bit i love it
cause 16 bit final fantasy <3
if it's one thing I dread about RPGs, its that I keep picking up more, and never finish any of them
I keep thinking today is monday but it's sunday
Deacon: i recommend persona 3, you wont get RPG syndrome and its only 5 bucks
Sup :D
ohai Havok

too bad shes 14 T~T
the second one probably is true
and a cartoon, Bronysith
don't forget about that
cowvarkian: and?
she's a cartoon
cowvarkian: and?
not real?
and?
pfft... cartoon*mumblesabouts2lunamumblemumble*
Is any of this real?
pretty sure it is
last time I checked, I existed
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide... no excape from reality...
and have a less convoluted back story then a one year old anime character
/me that feeling when your office chair's recline bar slips out of place and you suddenly go tipping over backwards at an alarming rate.
that was funny
And that's why you reseat your anti-recline bar on a regular basis everypony.
the more you know
and knowing is half the battle
and booze is the other half
sounds like a shitty battle
I want a briefcase full of gold/money to come down the chimney
oh you, Bronysith
oh you
I'd rather have Luna than gold, tbh
I'd rather be rich than insane

Anyone want to RP?
RP is not allowed in this room
*Want to RP In the PM?*
FillyRD: wrong chat
which room?
scout19_tf2: any brony state room
unless it's bronysith and BDSM related that is
so why not dis one
Bronysith is going to stop his RP as well.
scout19_tf2: because they are the rules
it just pisses people off and floods the chat with stuff most do not want to read
probably
Chrysalis: yes there are rules but they neva put those rules in da rules thing
nvm yes it ends january 5
08,01i *love* Tolkien's creation myth from the Middle-Earth mythos
08,01it's so awesome
13it was sneezed into existence?
"Bronystate is not an RP channel, and as such, excessive Role-Playing is discouraged"
08,01i'd totally follow that religion, if i was in need of one
its in the rules
da rule
z
scout19_tf2: it's there also some rules are obvious and if everything was put there the rules would be so long and boring noone would read them
08,01Shizuka: the material world was created as a physical manifestation of a song which one of the "angels" had sowed thoughts of discord into

voice says press I
shizumobile: wat game is dis?
oh synaesthete
08,01one thing i don't like about the Middle-Earth mythos, is that a lot of it (the bits concerning Sauron) are essentially saying that technology and science are bad
im back
Somethings wrong with yotutube...
You'll want to up your volume :3
This music is awesome
Eulshy: nah they just changed the layout :P
jcelios: exactly
No, whenever I try to watch the nes mlp episode, my player crashes
BEN stahp fakin round with bronies
And it only crashes for the new episode
Eulshy: There's always something wrong with youtube.
shizumobile, what is this game called?
synaesthete
lel notes just liek mario
the lore in this game is batshit
I think I like it
Java, I checked the video, the ad loaded, on every different one i tried to watch of it, it always crashed as it came it
Eulshy: BEN
So, what's this game?
synaesthete
No clue wtf that is
Kandarihu: synaesthete
Eulshy: Go get adblock?
Hmm, I guess it's not on Steam
You know, if you don't want to listen you only had to say
/me parachutes into the chat
Kandarihu: nope

/me really wishes he was on shrooms for this stream

Shizuka, lost stream

yup just came back up for me
It came back up without a restart
refresh
sound is fine
Turn up btw
Shizuka: is this like a multitasking game?
Best track
hardest multitasking game is bronystate/homework
collect notes while playing the song
jkljkjljk
twilight_sprinkle: wha is homework?
cachi01: im not sure, i think its something on bronystate
cachi01: I heard it was a hard paper that makes you learn and practice
blasphemy
ikr
I just googled this game. It's a Digipen student's game?
Going to download it.
Is it okay if I put the download link for this game here?
well i better make a note in my phone called ''cool indie gmes i must download in my new pc''
cachi01: or write it down in a piece of paper
HAHHAHAHAHAAHHA
nein
dats humwahrck
cachi01: you might never know that you lost your phone
I'll put the link mmmkay
https://www.digipen.edu/?id=1170&proj=383
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
thelonepony: o_o
Those people at Digipen made awesome game ideas.
cachi01: well, i lose my phone constinly and i find it the next day
oh lol
bahs tiem
lol, indeed
The Voxel King is attacking the stream!
scintillant hues!
thelonepony, is there another phone you can use to dial your main phone, like a landline?
Kandarihu: nope, i said before that i find it the next day
This looks addictive
its funky beats have got a hold of me!
anypony here has an amazing gaming pc?
4ish years ago mine was :<
cachi01: nope
my computers sucks
its because idk what graphics and how many ramn and what processor i must buy >.<
ram*
i want mah pc to run everything
no lag
cachi01: depends on your budget
but i dont want to spend 200 dollars on I7
if you have a very large budget, a top end i5/i7
for medium range
cachi01: You can ask someone who know how to build pc in your budget range.
go for a AMD Bulldozer
Buy a supercomputer cashie, should only cost a few hundred million
twilight_sprinkl|mob: lol

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: (Rumor) Possible Upcoming Episode Title
oh thx Kandarihu :)
cachi01, no problem
so i can ignore it
oi Chrysalis you hung over?
Bronysith: i dont get hangovers
Chrysalis: good on ya
Kandarihu: i think i'll go for an outstanding thx :)
now i just need to show this to my dad
I've got my eyes set on making something akin to a Very Good
I hope you can afford all the parts, though.
Kandarihu: anyone on about building a serious pc
should realise that you should consider money a none object
to get a proper rig
op op oppan tiger style
yeah outstanding or excellent
Chrysalis, I don't have the kind of budget to even build a Destitute class right now. Not unless I'm going to go through super saving mode for several months.
seriously your assigning ship classes to desktop rigs?
this is an amazing idea
dibs on titan class
>.>
NAS are generally a pretty good idea
large portable storage without actually needing to move it
anyone around
So the NAS would just be sitting in some part of the house, and the main box would be in an HTPC on top of my VCR/DVD player.
i would definately recommend an SSD as the main drive
Why did it have to be snakes
whats a floppy disk?
yeah
that can't be healthy
I know what a floppy disk is Im just joking. Dont hurt me....
are we live?
/me takes Kipkat07_Scarf away to slumber
/me slumbers
pony_1242: yes
well, the stream is live
ok
:P
does the stream keep bufferingn for anyone
then why are watching a video game?
alexxm|colt: not here
jcelios, as long as there isn't a point where internal air pressure isn't contained, it should be okay.
pony_1242: becauase that is what is currently streaming
hiya everypony :p
but a video game isnt pony related
no
we do not stream pony related videos at all time
or it would get old
oh
Get over it
this is bronystate, not ponystate
so is there anything we can talk about?
pretty much anything
so... how are you doing all, and what game is that?
everything else is in the rules
Michael: this is synesthesia
i know chrysalis
Chrysalis: looks good :3
looks hard
also that :)

Barbetos so I could play it
:|
What did you buy it for though Lil_B
pony_1242: calm down, he'll be back

If I missed ya, I'm sorry.
jcelios, I don't know, I think they're a group of unnatural colourful adolescent equine
/me kirby suplexes Everlasting_Joy
Everlasting_Joy: no problem
AdamTheDuck: sounds gaaaaaaaaaaay
Guys, have any of you heard that WarZ got pulled of Steam because... well, basicly they lied to everyone?
/me vanishes into a start.
Lil_B: yup
Lil_B, rofl WarZ
Lil_B: yea
lol
Lil_B, what happened?
dayz came first
What are we watching?
well, the Guy behind WarZ was also behind another infamous game
I knew that game was going to die somehow, but not this bad XD
I'unno what WarZ is
He also worked on "Big Riggs" xD
hello\
GabeMoist: nothing important XD
Big Rigs is a swell game
Hello rcman914
warz is incomplete
Chrysalis, was it?
what is this game?
AdamTheDuck: yeah
they were selling a incomplete game?
terms and license was a copy paste, and part of the company history was fraudulent, I think
it was a pre-release on steam
warz IS NOT the first zombie mmo
Chrysalis, ... A lesson for any other developer who wishes to release an unfinished game and "patch it later".
AdamTheDuck: minecraft
Well, to be honest, there have been games before that got sold before they were incoplete on Steam
Stronghold 3
speed gel
Chrysalis, I was thinking more like Fallout New Vegas
But at least they didn't lied to the consumer as WarZ did
Chrysalis, Minecraft was in beta anyway
FNV worked on launch date to me
bronies
AdamTheDuck: it was sold back in alpha
minecraft's never been on steam
NICE
Oh yeah, alpha, not beta
yay
brony state
bronystate
yeah

BrownieStaet

cleaning
I bought it in alpha
http://i.imgur.com/kcZ3o.png
What I didn't understand was, why did they charge you for the game, then the microtransactions?
u can have 100% refund
Lil_B inception
no, I can't, I didn't buy it on steam
and I didn't feel scammed
/me suplexes a nuclear Rocket
boing
god that hurt :P
yes, Steam is offering 100% refund for WarZ

/me is nuclear rocket
/me is nuclear jcelios

jcelios: 7.49 right now

If you like western rpg with a bit too much mmo style, it's great, I enjoyed it despite that hint of mmo age
AdamTheDuck: eh, i still have persona 3 to play
What is a game?
Ah I remember this game. The team who made this game got hired by Valve for Portal 2
howdyx: a miserable pile of secrets

they needed this in portal 2
in fact it was going to be
yeah would have been really cooler
and it was supposed too be purple
This is where portal got it I am pretty sure.
Chrysalis: They did. The team who made this game got hired by Valve.
Chrysalis: Probably, but my dad would of probably barfed half of his body weight up
So this was the Digipen project?
Java: Nah, that was nebacular drop I think
yes
Unless they hired this team too
Vivix: yep
Nebacular Drop
so sticky
that's what the team did before Portal 1, Portal 1 team disbanded a bit before Portal 2, and some of them made some other potal style game
Nice stick!
Never tried Nebacular Drop, can't see stream so don't know if that's what's on
Vivix: Quantum Conundrum right?
think that was remnants of the orig portal team, yes
and many checkpoints where checked that day
John De Lancie voice that game
oh god watchign the camra move is makign me sick
Not a huge JdL fan
needs more blue
at least the game is fun
"Stupid advertisement.
Never tried quantum-
Looks alright, though
Everlasting_Joy: Go get adblock or Ghostery

Barbetos: Paint world is best world

4 colours is enough
...
If this is how it was for real painters then I would feel like I have the wrong job.
imagine u could do that irl
wikipedia really is an amazing educational reasource :o
The kinds of cop chases we would see
it would be expensive as fuck
jcelios: IKR?
kidzrul732: this game's developers have been actually hired by Valve to work on Portal 2, so maybe thats why :)
Benderkeeps dancing on my screen.
Lol
Michael: Wikiuniversity and Wikibooks is awesome too though most people don't know about them!

aw
the BUCK acyronem confuses me
http://i.imgur.com/QX8w3.jpg So... This is why the 21st did not happen the way it was supposed to according to the Mayans
Rex_Mundi, from my understanding, it wasn't a unicorn, it was a Kirin. And it's not scientifically proven. It's just the NoKo government making a silly claim that astonishes it's own people and entertains the rest of the world.
Kandarihu: It was a joke statement, I also dont belive that Kim jung il invented Golf. Whats a Kirin?
Rex_Mundi, not sure.
Barb|Lappy didn't randy savage save us well
I sure hope Bronycon doesnt keep moving away. New York is a decent travel from Massachusetts, but Baltimore is even further! gahh!
What did you just say? http://i.imgur.com/ZGRbj.gif

Well. I have a new webcomic to keep me occupied for a while
BronyCAN. Canada's premiere Brony convention, being held in Beautiful British Columbia.
Canadian_Brony: Is it west coast, its still powerfully away if its in Montreal or something.
nvm
Barb|Lappy: lolcats xd
it's far if I have to leave the province or mainland. Vancouver Island, Alberta, Yukon, and whatever state is below me.

Grammar nazis take it to the streets, and make sure you are historically accurate now. http://i.imgur.com/jebk1.jpg
If you gona offend, then do it correctly.
Do East coast canadians go to Bronycon, or is there a major east coast brony convention in canada?
like i said yesterday.. if i get derpy hoodie i will take picture of me in it and post here
nah, they probably go to Bronycon. BronyCAN is the first Canadian brony convention and it's over here on the west coast, so I would suspect they'd head south.

13or a stream going bork <<
Does anybody Wrek planning on drawing again sometime soon
08,01heh
Shizuka, there was a spam attack yesterday on the chat .-.
08,01it's funny because it's true.
Well its a good thing noone is power hungry like that
right?
08,01also, stop everything you're doing
08,01right now

00,02yeah, afaik i can kick anyone except Tom
Phase4 beautifull driver beautifull break foot
well, noone can /kick Tom...
right?
it depends on the number of flags, I think
because kicking tom would hurt your foot/hoof
logicz
also /paw
13nope
13[18:34] *** Tom #bronystate Cannot kick or deop a network service
00,02tempted to try

13your stance could use improvement
00,02:)

08,01and today i realised i'm really bad at spelling #bronystate
00,02XD
13you have to ground your weight with your feet
aw well
13then turn your whole body into it
if there is ever an episode with g..k in the title , will !cd result in tom trying to kick himself ?
that would be amusing
Shizuka: if /kick has a stance, how the hell do we keep it with the siderooms during EPs
wheres flutter chu
pony_1242: give him some time
Oh of course!
13you know you stand in one spot your foot is a blur and you just keep kicking

08,01well... yes...

Applejack is LEAST PONY!...<_<>_>
08,01racist barn, racist barn...
one two three four
08,01anyhoos, yes
/me 08,01aways
/me wasn't here during the time his nick said "|AFK"
"racist barn" what?
/me WASN'T HERE
so nothing is on right now?
/me dammit
Rex_Mundi "Raise This Barn" sounds like "Racist barn"
from the new episode where APPLEJACK SINGS and WRITES A LETTER TO PRINCESS CELESTIA
first for the series AND the season
yup
/me walks away singing "racist barn racist barn 1 2 3 4~"
wasn't her first one that stated that she didn't learn anything
technically, Applejack still does not have her own song
also the new ep was meh
technically shut up
if you look in the begin of that song, bonbon is techically a member of the apple family
you see her in the crowd
applehorse's song sounded like something barney would sing in an amish episode
rcman914 Applejack writes the first letter of the season
Canadian_Brony|AFK: false
pink obnoxious wrote a letter son
Ponies singing is just... a thing
Canadian_Brony|AFK: pinkie pie did dumbass
do you even horses?
Bronysith oh, well one of 2 then
didn't her first one in seaon 2 said she didn't learn anything
yes it did
I have a shirt that says it
mah favourite shirt http://www.welovefine.com/1708-drink-cider-learn-nothing.html
best part of new ep was FiddleSticks
actually more quarter ass
1/8th ass
Infinitesimal Ass
^
Bronysith: more like I had a terribad experience watching the ep
huh http://derpiboo.ru/191010 seems Cloudchaser is also an apple
Herro.
I think it would be cool to have carrottop some distant relative of applejack
and make her a carrot farmer
You know what the people should stream?
99 luftballons
A Disney movie.
they have
you missed it
SuperSanjitenks1989: you should shush and they stream whatever the fuck they want to stream
for all the background filler ponies they used I miss Derpy...
Bronysith: Geez man, sorry. No need to be harsh.
wat? carrot tops an apple?
RoboGerbil: she's a carrot obv
Bronysith: no, the Rainbow_dash room did >_<

also that fic is retardedly overrated and horribly written
oh sorry
Heh, 24th in Australia :P
I still got 6 hours to wait for Hearth's Warming Eve -__
Same here, but that does not seem to stop most families.
-__-
well
that face...
0,5What pissed me off once was in bronycon
Spaghetti?
0,5When there was a fire, and the guy yelled "everypony get out" or something
lol
HAH!
0,5Well, other than the unprecedented amounts of spaghetti
lol
Isn't it just GRAND!?
BaconMane: that was tara strong
man its been shot dead not has it
oh, puh-LEASE. Don't get me started on spaghetti..
0,5It's like, you can't put the stupid ponyisms away for two seconds?
BaconMane What if everyone but you was turned into a pony? Not RP. Serious question.
holy shit shut up about spaghetti
i can enjoy the tasty dish anymore
can't hold all dis spaghetti...
0,5I mean, people shouldn't say ponyisms in real life to start with.
my chat just losts its nuts
yep this definetely is my fave colossus
i say em in real life
BaconMane: the regulars skype caht changed you
and im proud
Well.. Yeah. Its different for Tara. She gets PAID to do it.
0,5Barbetos: I can't take that question seriously at all.
BaconMane I dunno why I seriously even considered or asked it honestly
0,5Bronysith: I haven't used ponyisms purposely for a long time.
Just my random I guess.
I don't go out of my way to say "everypony" irl, but I have said it before just to piss off non-bronies :p
Lies, BaconMane.
You use them all the time in skype calls.
0,5*purposely*
Make a craptonne of references to the show and watch the dumb bastard squirm *evil grin*
Recent DWR ?
recently*
Every time.
Actively hiding your power level is the way to go. Not using ponyisms helps.
So yes.
He loves his ponies :3
are we fighting :'(
yes
/me punches jcelios
LEVEL UP
He has over 9000 spaghetti !
all i know is ppl dont mind me using ponyisms in real life
/me ductapes cachi01|SOTC's mouth shut

0,5Ashie Poo
mhmhmhm
hmmhmm!
0,5Hey
ooh yeah
cachi is best pyro
sowwy
Canadian_Brony: lel
no, I take it back!
dats shizuka
Shizu is best pyro
0,5There's like a billion other channels for RP in the IRC
Hm?
Canadian_Brony: exactly
0,5Why must you do it here?
http://twilight.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/134659929002.jpg
BroPony|MEDIC No no no.. all we know for sure is people are not expressing their true feelings on the matter. You should ask them if they have a problem with it
i guess rp'n is just impossible not to do
0,5Be like "yo man, let's do some rp" if that's your thing
0,5And take it elsewhere
0,5it's NOT THAT HARD.
It is, BroPony|MEDIC.
And this is coming from BaconMane
Barbetos: I have, and they told me they dont care. just dont get carried away and i make sure not to
It is possible*
I know. I have been kicked before for excessive RP, so I know the limit.
trust him when he says this
hehehehe
0,5Trying to purge chat of idiocy here
BaconMane: oh can i help?
BaconMane: you are wasting breath
BaconMane: i just came and u lied alreadu :|
BaconMane, one does not simply purge idiocy from the internet
I got a 1-minute ban...
One must use FIRE >:D
Canadian_Brony: both typical
Role Play is not a sign of idiocy last I checked. More like... annoyance for people wnating to just... Chat... In, you know, a chat rooom
Canadian_Brony: so i had a 2 month ban :
Ive been kicked at least a good 100+ times now
:|
Then agian.. Some Role Play does beg the question.
i mind my Ps and Qs here
0,5Yeah, Barbetos, and the RPers not getting the clue that it isn't a room for RP
I've been botkicked. I flood accidentally sometimes. :(
Am I a masochist for not playing Bayonetta with Accesories?
I type too fast.
"lightening bolt! lightening bolt!"
0,5That is where the idiocy spawns
0,5Or, rather, shows
0,5Also, *lightning
lets sing the song of the lonely mountain mah brothers
BaconMane: oh god, back in May
0,5May?
blah
thats when it was worse
the RP
I spel everything exactly the way I mean to every time I spell it.
*worst
0,5Ah
0,5I don't keep track of months
0,5The next month is August, right?
0,5:3
Yep.
yes
this is a place where brony meet to watch streams and chat not rp ya ropleplayers
0,5Oh sweet I was right :D
Canadian_Brony: some mods naturally get pissed off more easily than others
and talkin bout stream
then its november
and after comes November.
BaconMane: may u plz turn on some youtube vidos
then july
Yes. It can be August. Infact I am fairly certain all the other months of 2013 are just not going to show up.
then march
0,5I don't stream.
and then monday
Dont, elsie.
August is the only one brave enough.
Wait a minute it's July? Why do I have a tree up>
So we have... August, then Jan 2014
*?
0,5We can do IRC games
YES

WE SHOULD PLAY WAREWOLF!
0,5Let's try this out.
Mad Libs over IRC.
im still learning
0,5Alright, simple and easy, hangman. Let me think of a phrase
BaconMane: movie titles?
like last year?
this should be fun
or hangman...
i guess
0,5Let me have a moment or two to figure out how this will work.
k
How about cheesey movie titles.
BaconMane: like when i ask ppl to ask me questions?
BaconMane: what about 6 mistakes = we r fucked
I like the game where you are given the genre and initials of a movie title and have to guess what it is
^
BaconMane: what will hapen if someone hack a admin account?
Canadian_Brony: die hard
Prince_Lightstar: Here's a question: Do you know how to actually spell 'people?'
i won
damn

There was no price.
Prince_Lightstar: for irc or an op account on irc?
/me flips Canadian_Brony

0,5Alright
either way they'll wish they didn't XD

0,5Let's try this method first.
and ow
Canadian_Brony: .-.
Canadian_Brony: dont judge me im nuht murrican le
DH...
MakerDusk: no im talkin about hacked into an admins account on here like lets say someone hacked into Sumica's account and banned everyone?
0,5I will ask one person to guess, and they will give their guess, so we don't have everyone guessing all at once.
got it
0,5And turns will be taken before someone solves it.
that works
cachi01|SOTC: ...damn
that isnt it?
Wait...
Deck the Halls?
BaconMane: wat will hapen if someone hacked an admins account
no thats DtH
Prince_Lightstar: then they should have used a certfp
enough shadow of the colossus for today
MakerDusk: :|
0,5Phrase is the following: _ _ _ _ - _ _ _ _ - _ _ _ _ _
other than that, I get alerts every time a password is entered wrong
cachi01|SOTC: mainly cause you are almost done
Canadian_Brony: as i thought
Bronysith: exactly
is that your guess?
BaconMane: at a letter?
Bronysith: that last collosus was awesome
0,5Yeah
e
and if there are multiple attempts to breach an account, I'll be there pretty fast
0,56 mistakes = f**ked

0,5The amount of guesses you get is the number of letters in the phrase.

0,5Longer phrases mean longer times.
BaconMane: and i cant guess ofc

0,5_ _ _ _ - A _ _ - _ _ _ _ E _

oh oh
Pat, I'd like to buy a vowel!
ya'll wanted the D
0,5Still 4/13 guesses with 4 letters in.
CrystalPhoenix hangman, now wait your turn to guess a letter.

bled ass?
08,01wait, so there's no E in the middle word, and no D... IT IS ASS

It won't become popular unless 4Chan praises it like it did MLP
0,5There are n-..... W? Really?
I'd like to buy a vowel
hey bronies I'm watching Animaniacs!
For all we know the middle word could be all
no Ls
I KNOW
it wont be popular because its not good.
SOMEONE SAY G
hi kidzrul732. Kewl
Actually, if BaconMane is smart, he'll accept payments over Paypal for as many free vowels as we'd like to guess, $1 per vowel.
0,5There are of course no Ws in here
08,01my god, who said W?

Feel free to guess the phrase any time
and it doesnt work.
0,5Oh right, then I take it back, 6/13 guesses
...
"Adult humor"?

Ah SpeccyRvsh is gonna get it
Cold Ass Honkey
Wtf kind of children's show is this?
YEP
0,5Speccy, you mean the phrase?
do i guess again or did i blow it?
0,5Yes, that is it
a lot of the phrases will fly right past a kid's head.
. . .
WTF
wat
Damn
0,5C O L D - A S S - H O N K E Y
Knew he'd guess it
WHO MADE THAT PHRASE?!!?
wtf is a honkey
it really was ass
So?
i knew it was ass
so are all of these phrases going to be inside jokes or what?
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Canadian_Brony: yours truely :3
The rugrats were the same way
wow
honkey: slang for white person
wtf.
Canadian_Brony: a quote from a song
0,5SpeccyRvsh, please PM me with the next phrase. Remember, nothing too inside-jokish
08,01I WAS FUCKIN RIGHT
^
I'm not defending them
Wut?
Im saying, it doesn't have the same appeal beyond children that mlp does even though they attempted to make it as such.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=c9s9sPXXkqw
Right about what?
hey Meth
I'm just thinking they may not be trying to mimic MLP
Hey
SpeccyRvsh knows
Good to know.
Hi meth
08,01Barbetos: i'm always happy about ass.
What's going on here?
How's that python tutorial going?
Imma gonna go eat and watch animaniacs
I'm just thinking they may not be trying to mimic MLP So SR is here...
I am working on modelling haha
IRC hangman. Welp.
whats a cartoon?
So you haven't started it, have you?
Yea
TheBucket we're playing hangman. Wait your turn and BaconMane will ask you to guess a letter.
08,01what's cartoons, precious?
I'll watch it when I get home
similar style characters, same voice actors, attempt of adding elements that older male fanbase would "like" (tried and failed).
0,5If you guys want a turn soon, you can try and grab my attention as well.
WAIT A MINUTE
ive forgotten what letters
and SpeccyRvsh is the phrase maker. tis gonna be rigged like a sailboat
errr
I'll try an episode then
wrong message
one sec
[21:39:52] <@BaconMane> No Ls
Canadian_Brony: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=c9s9sPXXkqw
if you watch one of each series you will see the attempted similarities.
But I don't watch MLP, so I won't be a very good judge
well then it doesn't count :P
ahaha, yeah thanks but no thanks
13elsie cheats
13everyone knows this
I get enough of MLP culture from the fandom
13he is naughty
0,5U kno it bb

Quiz me
anyways I dont know why im debating this, I was just pointing something out.
you should see him with Jmo

Yea, I'm probably not gonna watch it
okay I'm back

20 hours dungeon , no trial
Besides, I'm trying to reread Homestuck
/me protects otakon from chat
I'm starting to actually understand what the heck is going on
hi otakon. We're playing hangman. Wait your turn and BaconMane will ask you to guess a letter (as soon as Speccy decides what the next phrase will be)
You can't protect one from the chat
do you like cheetos?
dont know what that is
what I miss?
i liek trains
/me kicks TheBucket
oh
otakon: hangman
Why do ya'll like MLP
um is there a stream?

OW THAT HURT Bronysith
I LIKE CHEETOS
otakon the end of the world.
I dont think everyone here does.
0,5We have a phrase!
we are still alive
Homestuck is a web series that is basically... Too difficult to explain
LETS DO THIS
neat , what is it ?
08,01yyyeEEAAhhhh
inb4 to easy
gotta go fast?
lol
also otakon, I have determined that your computer is capable of performing tasks that do not require internet access.
This should be interesting
0,5New rule for you guys
I watched one episode, thats it. ive been meaning to watch more just because
0,5Since we're trying this out and all.
rules aren't fun, but ok
I think its a good series, thats why I watch it.
0,5THe number of tries you get is the # of letters in the phrase, x 1.5
http://www.snotr.com/video/8965/
Quick question is there going to be one new rule added after every game
BaconMane: k :)
a'right
mmm
let's do this
okay back
ANOTHER flash crash
lol
lolololol
0,5So our phrase from SpeccyRush is _ _ _ _ - _ _ - _ _ _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ which gives us 24 guesses.
this is ridiculous that's one a day now
otakon: Arent thay just lovely
0,5Everyone except Speccy can guess
gee i wonder what SpeccyRush is up to
BaconMane that's just about the entire alphabet there.
0,5Now we begin
Wow
oh
A
Four words hunh
hmmm
TheBucket: its not your turn
I'll try whenever I get called I guess
*Huh
BaconMane: U
:o
otakon: happening to me also, about one a day :<
:/
DerpyMuffins: ITS NOT UR TURN
0,5Otakon, guess: _ _ _ _ - _ _ - _ _ _ - _ _ _ _ _ _
no
his name is ota
sounds cool
get it right
lelelelel
Yea
It's very long
uhmm
quiet cash
also, made a new video yesterday. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O5qBb3Y_Zs
better than my previous haha.
otakon?
still kind of boring.
oi potato answer
/me planks on Canadian_Brony head
0,5Times up
0,5Canadian brony, guess: _ _ _ _ - _ _ - _ _ _ - _ _ _ _ _ _
otakon! You imbecile!
err

he's sure taking his time
0,5Nice one!

hooray!
0,5There are four E's
Nice
EEEE
hmmm
How many points do I receive?
thats a hexa
oh
none
Nope
Oh wow
stfu speccy
0,5_ E _ _ - _ _ - _ _ E - E _ _ _ _ _
oh snap
Canadian_Brony, I award you no points, and may god have mercy on your soul.
lelel
Thats three you imbecile
let me guess flutter chu is not here
0,5oops
this is my mini quad. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLVp-0Ih0yc
LELELELEL
0,5_ E _ _ - _ _ - _ _ E - E _ _ _ _ E
ooh i know, its EEEE EE EEE EEEEEE
0,5there we go
I was about to say
no camera mount on the mini quad though
twilight_sprinkle: lol
I've been wanting to make a quad with my raspberry pi
whats going on?
I need a proper mount for my hexa so I can stick a gopro on it and not the shitty contour.
hmmm
0,5Cachi01, guess
0,5_ E _ _ - _ _ - _ _ E - E _ _ _ _ E
T
i think i know 3 out of 4 of the words
But I don't know how to get a battery that's both powerful and light enough to run 4 motors
cause theres obviusly a THE out there
Whatever you say Mr. Brad
T
I wouldnt use a raspi for flight control.
0,5There are two Ts
teen titans tower
0,52Ts
Why not?
0,5*2Ts
now that's surprising
i am real super sand
sweet
seems like it would serve better for a different project.
i think i know 3 words too
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: The Truth / This One Counts! / A Present for Twilight / Rarity's Calm and Collected Solution / Gem Fever
dunno the last one tho
0,5_ E _ _ - T _ - T _ E - E _ _ _ _ E
taoumi: yay <3
cachi01: super pooper scoopers are just legenduh
oh, nop nvm
0,5Bronysith, guess a letter
I didnt think it was possible to play hangman in a chat
BroPony|MEDIC: you'll see freezy pop! im stronger than an ant
BaconMane: was B taken yet?
ooo, hangman
I would probably use vision tracking on it too
weeping_pegasi82 it is now
the flight control needs a very tight control loop for functions, and its probably going to be a ton of extra work to make a raspi work when theres other options that are quicker.
0,5There are no Bs
if an ant was this big ( )
please*
use raspi for vision processing and a dedicated board for flight control
BaconMane, your colour script needs improvments :P
I have an arduino, but it's not powerful enough to run vision tracking software
Good idea
The first word is stumping me
BaconMane: S then
sup every pony
uhm ( )
0,5There is 1/24 guesses
Por que no los dos?
Phase4 yes, now be patient and BaconMane may ask you to guess. Just don't be like ota and run away.
Why you naked Phase4?
0,5Phase4: halp me ;__;
i think i know two possible ones for the first word
Ah, you're just fuckin with me
Bronysith: you get only one guess at a time
atmega328 is powerful enough for basic flight control
idk the last one
using arducopter.
0,5Bronysith, you cannot ask if a letter is taken, and then ask another one.

can't imagine why
SO MUCH COLOUR
Phase4: lel
BaconMane: i was asking if someone already said B
Dem colours
i dont get it
I don't Phase4...
0,5i cnfyrt see whtay im toyping
Aww
0,5u made me nhlind
You know I love that god damn rainbow text.
:D
Let me check which arduino I got
If you want to get flying, a KKMulticopter board is basic and like $25,
lol
0,5Allrighty
that's pretty much the same thing bronysith
http://ohn1ne.tumblr.com/post/38680555599/this-shit-is-real-i-have-a-bottle-of-the-special
0,5So there is 1/24 tries
can i guess a letter
and has an atmega32u i think.
0,5Buytoast, guess a letter
0,5_ E _ _ - T _ - T _ E - E _ _ _ _ E
crap baskets
O
Et go home
I have a mega 2560
Im a DJI Dealer so I sell all the DJI copter products.
0,5there is one O
Of course theres an O
yeah thats more than enough.

TRY STUFF FOR THE FIRST WORD
Derpy_Hooves lol "Dip Shit - for fruit!"
????? to the ?????????
0,5_ E _ _ - T O - T _ E - E _ _ _ _ E
BaconMane, for various reasons there doesnt seem to be any way to fix that problem on mirc
hi
nuu, do the last word
h
I only run DJI flight controllers.
H!
silly dev decided to make his own language and didnt include any proper string formatting
00,10Alex, i would like to buy a vowle
goddamnit
What's DJI?
a company that makes copter stuff.
Zohrd hush and wait your turn.
because why would you possibly want to format strings in irc scripts
Why did someone say my name?
Aw cool
Sumica they're free. Now wait your turn like the rest of us lesser folk.
dead to the ??????????????
I crashed a dji s800 into my trampoline
lol
00,10pffff turns
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHngxVg732U
lol
inorite?
to bad they EXIST in this game
@Neo, I get it
Thats not a cheap copter. Thats the dji professional series.
I LOST THE GAME
Why don't we have both?
what game?
0,5TheBucket, guess a letter
0,5_ E _ _ - T O - T _ E - E _ _ _ _ E
but I don't have the status to complain about these things
Umm
hell, I don't have the status to complain at all
Um
U
"Um" is not a letter
U is
is mayonaise a letter?
Is the 34th letter twilight_sprinkle
no twilight_sprinkle, mayonaise is not a letter.
That would be cool
Horseradish is not a letter either!
:<
with or without flight controller, if you wanted to do your own I have kits that just have motors, escs, frame, etc etc
BaconMane: IS THERE A U
NO U
08,01my god, why hasn't anyone said H...
"No Skrillex, a mac book is not an instrument."
You'd be surprised how much weight they can actually carry
0,5There are
Well I have an arduino and a gyroscope
0,5No U's
Do you sell a Pony Copter?
large LiPo batteries are not a problem.
FFFFFFFF-
dammit dont say h
Really?
hah
yeah
*sepukku*
08,01twilight_sprinkle: there's an H in it, you silly
0,5That's 2/24 guesses.
0,5Twilight sprinkle, guess a letter
0,5_ E _ _ - T O - T _ E - E _ _ _ _ E
The lipo packs I run on my hexacopter weigh the same as my hexacopter itself
Fuck me
when it doesnt have the battery pack.
0,5no thnx
I've never used anything smaller than a car battery for robotics projects
Hmm
N
08,01BroPony|MEDIC: you'll have to buy me dinner first
0,5no N's
fudge
/me does a little dance
If you want a quadcopter, a decent battery would be about 250-300 grams.
0,5That's 3/24 guesses. You know, what, only 10 guesses from now on. new rule.
08,01BroPony|MEDIC: excellent
Again dang
BaconMane: i want to guess the word
08,01i like indian food
Seriously?
0,5That's 3/10 guesses.
yes.
how do you do that SpeccyRush
0,5_ E _ _ - T O - T _ E - E _ _ _ _ E
0,5Cachi, guess away
BaconMane: dead to the equine
SpeccyRush please do not continue the lyrics.
Wow, and here I've been using car batteries for all my projects
My mind can't handle it.
0,5"To" and "The" are correct
damn
0,5You also nailed the H
last word dammiiiit
0,5H E _ _ - T O - T H E - E _ _ _ _ E
I run 6000mah lipo packs on my hexa and get a solid 15 minutes of flight time for each pack.
08,01L
wait...
08,01no, damn, P
Can i solve it baconMane?
Nice
BaconMane: you're not supposed to fill words unless the whole guess is right :|
08,01doggamnit
Now let me see what I already have
0,5Buytoast, if you think you have it.
On the s800, I run 2x 6S 6000mah packs
I think I may
for 20 minutes of flight time
/me 08,01isn't good at waiting his turn
goddammit
Head to the Engine
0,5Wrong.
now i dont know the last one
hmmm
WRONG
Those are massive packs, but the s800 is a massive copter.
shit
that is THREE TIMES flash has crashed on this site for some reason
I have an Arduino, so I could probably use that as the controller
0,5otakon, guess a letter
0,5H E _ _ - T O - T H E - E _ _ _ _ E
its not that simple.
?
L
otakon don't fuck it up this time
08,01otakon: it's because you touch yourself at night
You need a lot more than just an arduino
dammit two l's i bet
lol
0,5There are no L's
08,019instead of me)
I need motor controllers too, right?
hmm
welp
Get a KKMulticopter board
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
0,5That's 4/10 guesses.
its cheap and has everything.
that first word ain't "hell"
08,01HOW IS THERE NO ELL
0,5H E _ _ - T O - T H E - E _ _ _ _ E
lol
no L
so it's not help
the kits I have come with precalibrated motor controllers.
i want guess
or hell
oi wait your turns, no helping
Seriously?
it really depends what quality you want and how much you want to spend
Ponyfied versions of the countries you live in?
These disconnection are getting troublesome
0,5You going to guess?
I have almost nothing to spend.
for a quality DJI quad with a Naza Flight controller is $420
08,01oh right
dammit still last word
$230 of that is the Naza flight controller.
08,01have we had A yet?
no
i know the first
0,5There are no As
0,5That's 5/10 tries
OH COME ON
fuck
08,01goddamnit
Could I use Jaguar controllers?
that's ALL the vowels you idgit
08,01cans.wav
I like this game
*yay*
I dont know what that is
Or would those be too haevy?
mmmmmmmmmm
otakon no
helllpp
i dont even know what letters have been said already
0,5otakon: there is yet another vowel
"I" hasn't been asked iirc
08,01OTAKON NOOOOOO
We still have Y
I GOT IT
0,5Anyone want a turn?
no you don't
BaconMane: i think i know
I do
BaconMane: heir to the empire
I dont
0,5Are you sure?
LIES
for $190, you can get the quad frame, arms, motors, motor controllers, and props
BaconMane: ME
inb4 sprunkls won
0,5Huh, you got it right.
"Props"?
propellers
dufuq
http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Heirtotheempire.jpg
well shit, i was thinking heil to the Empire
08,01shit, twilight_sprinkle is good at these
Ah
wat
0,5heir to the empire - SpeccyRush
i forgot that heir is a word
i have no ideas for the new phrase though
Gah
if everyone would click my link
0,5I'll make a phrase.
okay
then figure out the flight controller for yourself, or buy a flightcontroller kit from somewhere else.
is is "Shizuka is best pony"?
DENIED
*it
SpeccyRush: #1 best seller!
I think the fun would be to figure it out myself :P
Or buy a Naza, which is like the best easiest plug and play system you can get.
(I hope)
0,5Intermission!
it depends if you want to tinker or fly.
cue the music!
Tinker
k brb gettin some pringles
Definitely tinker
Canadian_Brony: *Vivi
then a KKMulticopter board is what you want
or an ardupilot board.
I've only been chosen once :P

hmm i have an idea for the phrase, might be very hard to guess
/me 08,01thinks he should maybe shower first...
if you want to try to make your own from scratch, you can, but it might not be as fun when it refuses to work after days of tinkering :P
HOLY CRAP TODAYS THE 23RD
I know it would be, but for me the fun is in building it from scratch
brb
lol
but yeah buy the basic kit from me and you can build your own flight controller.
0,5Okay!
Bronysith INORITE?

Why not make a 2nd forum?
I mean, there can't be many MLP forums... Right?
all one million of them.
ShizuKlaus: you can break it more....
I came back here to spam. LOL
13IFDreebs: We did that last year but it got old after a while

aybody heer about the sine flu?
darkspyro and spyroforum
Sorry

there used to be spyro fans anonymous
Let me rephrase the question
snoop
loGanN, almost as bad as Cosine flu
i only heard about the cosine flu
How many Spyro forums are there that don't suck?
I win
twilight_sprinkle: Do you have, like, 100 of you so I can put you on this cookie?
1
tangent flu is best flu
Yea

but i r gaben

Tanflu was horrible
dammit GabeMoist
Of course, the UI could be better
i love you all
but if your going to count every little createyourownfreeforum spyro forum..
The UI is pretty classic
There can be only one Gabe here
Petrified_Discord: nah, still wroking on the cloning machine
And so, nopony noticed Kip's fabulous scarf and always thought of him as the candy. Eventually he went crazy and fainted. He was eaten alive by the chat.
guy299443: There is a 3 in your name, you know?
Kipkat07_Scarf: lol
createyourownfreeforum?
cachi01: XDDDDDDDDD
13say if someone would like to pop into #help or poke MakerDusk to keep an eye on that guy proxying
.com
weee
New website I'm making
maybeh if i hide here they wont find meh..
oi MakerDusk
I actually had a free forum site half done.
ShizuKlaus: Who´s proxying now?
Lol
oh
ShizuKlaus: NOOOOOOOOOO
ShizuKlaus: you summoned him
why?!
every free forum would run punbb all running off of one main codebase.
and then Bronysith was ceasar?
Rex_Mundi: derpy.me is your friend
13because there's a proxying spammer that needs killing
lol
ShizuKlaus: ai
individual sqlite isolated databases
OI MakerDusk where are you?
http://www.forumotion.com/
ive been awake for 27 hours :) :P :D 6_9
@shizuKlaus did someone say gaben>??
ShizuKlaus I'm a bit weary of that RainbowPIEH person.
13yep proxying
couldn't you just do a wildcard ban on just guy*@* shizu?
+b *!*@199.255.psz.rzl
oi MakerDusk we need u to stahp evil
/me puts on his good pony hat
each forum would be allowed to install plugins and such
13wow you're stupid
and a ton of themes.
[04:47:37] * Joins: RainbowPIEH (gyjksibmmg@199.255.syr.vnv)
but I got bored so I never finished it.
wait, what's happening?
Some spammer is using a proxy.
I wish there was a new type of forum
lol
How?
oh great -__-
One that didn't run on BB
I don't know
Who is that spammer?
Call the cyber police
im stil watching the fir e-_____-
I no see spammers
Backtrace it
----________----
13i can't i left my visual basic GUI at home
guyys i cant mov
scoot: you can pause you know
lol
Something that was more modern. Didn't require any BB codes, was much more friendly. Nicer organization
ok :3
DashWithRainbows: what was the name of that server where i was the boss? i need to make sure to avoid that place >.<
I like punbb because its simple and lean.
And Appew Fwittews
The problem is that I'm so use to BB forums, I can't even think of what it would be like
/me knits a pony into his fabulous scarf
It's the VS Ponyville Texas server.
you can use a wysiwyg editor... but lots of people prefer bbcode.
okay
I want a god damn Double X Gundam
Kipkat07_Scarf: Sounds like a gorefic :P
Why do you want to avoid it?
It's an awesome server.
I don't mean a wysiwyg either
/me is bored to death
/me dies
DashWithRainbows: cause i was immensely stupid
I don't really *know* what I mean
ShizuKlaus: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJwyW9ngLNg >.>
So?
Petrified_Discord: NONONONO.
Keep playing and you'll learn.
I don't see the "gaben" spammer anymore, hopefully he was either murdered by a PonyChat mod or he just left.
Something that doesn't feel like 1998
Just like with any other game.
Kipkat07_Scarf: :D
hey guys, you know how there are Starwars transformers toys? What if there were MLP transformers toys?
i dont like chistmas verry much it justt remimds me how lonly i am
THE BOOK FACE

Rex_Mundi: wat
twilight_sprinkle: ah, Tf2 you gotta kill them sprunkls >:3
lol
Not a Facebook style either
DashWithRainbows: i guess, i hope they wont remember my name..
Meh, don't worry about it.
We've had much worse.
Or, hell with it, they should make Pony gundams
okay :$
KrazyNoobs: dat drama
RainbowPIEH132 (gyjksibmmg@74.115.o.txp) Quit (K-Lined) OVERKILL
I made one.
http://therealspyro.forumotion.com/
Rex_Mundi: eh, why not, ponies have already ruined everything else
KrazyNoobs: and im very thankful for that
13lol
cachi01: They did 2 days ago...
KrazyNoobs: no more shouuting and shit
guys i shokked my bother with two batteries
DashWithRainbows: whats funny is that i was Just about to ask you about special powers of the bosses before i got chosen
ha bold
13color wat
13oh
i forgot
"Your first forum"
my bad
Nice
thelonecubone|BL2: i was doing ok on other servers, but i really messed up on the boss map, i didnt know how it works
But that's exactly what I dislike. There's too much clutter
DashWithRainbows: *how special powers work
Well, I could write up a pastebin of those I know.
Something simple. Elegant.
cachi01: Shouting?
yeah they fight alot
i miss my uncl
only colors I see on my screen atm are shizu, but then again I'm using mIRC as opposed to the web chat
13so for the one person maybe watching my map, i'm digging out the basement
lol
I know.
Meh, I would know if I saw it
ShizuKlaus: i noticed
Rex_Mundi: no because the show would be shitty after dat
ShizuKlaus: Im watching.
Protip twilight_sprinkle: When it is an admin boss, prepare for incredibly OP-ness.
cachi01: They just disagreed on something and then my dad took off to New Zealand.
i'm watching :P
DashWithRainbows: well, if theres a lot i'll just ask someone else over voice, that'll be easier instead of typing it
It's always in good fun though.
0,5Shizu: did you make the minecraft thing yourself?
13dynmap is a plugin
KrazyNoobs: oh damn sorry bout that........
twilight_sprinkle There is an minimum age required to use the mic.
13otherwise it's showing me in realtime more or less
cachi01: what if it happens after the show ends?
cachi01: Thanks, I don't think it is going to last long anyway.
DashWithRainbows: hm they get special special abilities?
0,5As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted by gabens
Rex_Mundi: mass suicide
Rex_Mundi: that would be cool then
0,5Thanks for being my guinea pigs for Elsie's first IRC game time
0,5yey
why is my brother twiching
DashWithRainbows: i know, im pretty sure im over that age :D
and yeah lotsa suicides lol
Ya'll should sign up for my forums
loGanN: cold i guess
BaconMane: Youre welcome :3
DashWithRainbows: i didnt plan to use mic anyway though :P
BaconMane: Did you manage to have that guy terminated by a PonyChat Mod?
They have 90k health usually, incredibly powerful rage that I think they get instantly.
Haha
No
For example.
cachi01: no it hot and hes like spazzing
Or hell, after the show ends, they should periodicly make TV/DVD specials and a full length feature film, just to Keep FIM alive until G5
I sell scarves and scarf accessories.
The Lauren Faust hale uses ALL the rages of other hale's at once.
thenks for conducting your experiments on us, BaconMane :P
BaconMane: whenever u need some guinea pig well, here we are :)
The show is not going to end anytime soon, everypony.
DashWithRainbows: lol i didnt even know there is a Lauren boss
Only way to survive it is to stand on top of a health pack as a pyro, I think.
twilight_sprinkle Admin only due to being so OP.
pwease
the last thing we need is another "darkspyroandcyder293.freeforums.com"
seriously
:P
Appledoom is my favourite admin hale though.
spyroxcynder4000yolo.freeforums.com
im crying and i dont know why its freaking me out
XD
register it
I would join
:P
loGanN: you just need to relax and distract yourself, or try to go to bed if you can
I would definitely join haha
You see, The Hub went from $350,000 per annum in 2011 to $35mil per annum in 2012, 98% being FIM's doing (EQD wrote about this). If DHX Media and Hasbro had any plans on cancelling the show (which would be stupid, they would lose money rapidly), The Hub would beg them to continue. Season 4 is already confirmed, I hope it keeps going.
/me hugs loGanN
DashWithRainbows: perhaps theres a site with information about them?
twilight_sprinkle: he says his bro is twitchin
and spazzin
Sorry for dat wall
Wait, the ending episode for season 3 will have twilights older sister (who is never mentioned until that point) doing... marring somepony ells that we havent heard of to that ponit to!
lol nice
cachi01: twitchin n spazzin how?
so we do gifts early.
Hmm, I think I can grab you the link to their site.
idk
twilight_sprinkle: i have been up for 34 hors in like 30 min ill be 35
Rex_Mundi: lololol
Rex_Mundi: cadenco
aw that sucks
34 hors!?
hors what are hors
someone's gotta.
I want one of those Wii Us
hors devours/
Thats perfect for you SR
I finally bought gifts for my brother and sister
im scared
Now just my parents I guess
hors are those people who do stuff with people
horse, or prostitutes?
you'll know when you're older
hours not hors
both
I bought my dad a soundbar for his tv
and my grandma this tea steeper thing.
I got my sister a crap ton of makeup
Rex_Mundi: i doubt they would repeat the formula :D but then again, (new) Spongebob did this sgain and again
But I personally think that they are going to make Ep10 of Season 3 amazing, have a large waiting time until the other three, and, hopefully, make an epic three-parter halfway through the wait for Season 4. This is probably far from the truth, but it still may be possible.
i got my sister some headphones
again*
and my brother a PSN card
isnt it spelled whores
I didn't go nuts this year
and some chocolate pretzels
:p
oh yeah only 13 episodes right?
it is, but i was making a funny :
:P*
I would like to buy someone who doesn't have an xbox 360 an xbox live card.
Why the w and r?
and we are already in episode 7 right?
that would be funny.
sees candy is the best
yup
shit
I want candy
this season was 3 months long
Meth, no one wants to.
dafak
Sorry but I'm not a fan of forums
why did you make one?
kafad
No one wants to join a forum that doesn't even have any posts
cachi01: long drought incoming...
Because we have no information on S3E10 11 12 and 13, (thus, no possibility of spoilers), what do you think the episodes will be on?
Because Spyro Forum needs more competition or something
:(
you gotta make like 30 user accounts that are all you posting and talking to yourself.
thats the secret to getting forums started.
lol
friendship
lol
twilight gets a visit from the future
That's not what happened with spyroforum
Something you did before SR?
from a guy called doc brown
GabeMoist: You just won 10 internet points.
cachi01: y is it only 13 eo?
Unless all of us starting members are secretly SR's alt accounts
thats how I started soliforum
he is riding a time traveling delorean
and don't actually exist
and twilight has to saaaaaaaaave the wooooooooorld
and a few other earlier forums
loGanN: eeyup
lol
spyroforum had enough initial people it didnt matter
cachi01: Y
cachi01, then they meet the doctor
yeah but he dies
cool
and ride off into the sunset on the backs on transformers?
the delorean crashes into the tardis
Y is it only 13 episods!!???
but really
I am hoping, for 10, a huge reference to pop culture or some more Equestria History, while for E11 - 13, a three parter going more into depth about the Crystal Empire... and Discord, we need lotsa Discord
soulrider95: oi dat season 4 premiere spoiler
You have to realize too Meth, our own Spyro forum here is not that active
because god hates us.
XD
We would rather have our forum more active..
I aint talking, they tried to get me to talk before, but i dont aim to now by gum.
loGanN: I am guessing Littlest Pet Shop had to be made to
than move to a brand new forum
awww
if you're actually serious about trying to compete with SF and dS, it's really not gonna happen
now im crying
I'm not gonna try and compete
Ill crush you like a bug.
No reason too
Spyro really doesn't have an audience that uses the internet
LPS! Y U TAKE AWAY FROM PONY
haha
at least not anymore
BECAUSE HASBRO
THATS WHY
we're like the mafia here.
loGanN: I watched Littlest Pet Shop, and it is just some cheap rip-off of MLP, in my opinion (no offence to LPS fans, sorry. :( )
you wanna open another forum ehh?
lol
well lets just see about that.
BAN BAN BAN
well, give it some time, eventually the kids will grow up and maybe join this place :)
well.
I blame Gaben
I need ponies during mid-terms and finals. I NEED PONIES.
it is
watch them both
/me goes crazy with a banhammer
happy crhristmas eev everypone
Ghoasts, commie ghoasts what dont know their dead. plotting to use our rockets to fly up and paint the moon pink and draw a lenin face on it.
lol
I appreciate them both.
:o
First member who joins will get ADMIN
thats why spyroforum is dead
haha
D:
all the members grew up.
I hate LPS, and hopefully, it doesn't go into Season 2. If it doesn't go into Season 2, we will probably have 26 episodes for Season 4... i dunno, it is complicated
is there anyone here that used to watch true capitalist radio?
noooo
mwahaha
the one with ghost?
except us.
yea
lol
you could always unset my flag
I don't watch radio

Does that mean I can destroy the forum?
I just would be silent for 3 seconds, and then quietly say the n-word
You'll be admin of no one
no one else will ever join
:P
Doesn't matter
nein

pony_3059 Sorry do say this, but he quit on April 29, 2012. (smartest thing he did since he started Radio Graffiti)
soulrider95: im sereus i forgot
like clockwork.
Geez that guy's annoying
srs?
What would you do if MLP got cancelled right before the season finale and the show was permanently destroyed from all medias (youtube, TV, internet, etc.)
send him back to xbox.
What do you expect from a guy who does Meth?
:P
Hey Guise
How about we all sing a campfire song?!... 99 buckets of oats on the wall, 99 buckets of oats. take 1 down, pass it around. 98 buckets of oats on the wall...
13not possible
Kipkat07_Scarf: nothing, I have all of them on my harddrive
lol
what do you expect from a guy who IS meth,
Meth seriously
METH
Stop impersonating other users
soulrider95: srs? sereus? yes? i dont no
Ghost wanted it to be something fun, not something taken over by trolls and bronies. Radio Graffiti is no longer there, and Ghost is no longer talking for True Capatalist radio
watch the chaos
DAFUQ
soulrider95: all destryoed
ok I seriousloy need to talk to this guy
noep.
Wow
Raid5
his main twitter just got banned, and this guy who calls himself FLAWC ( https://twitter.com/Gh0stP0litics ) hacked his backup account (Gh0stp0litics is his backu account)
I would most likely have to jump off of a bridge when I crack from stress
soulrider95: i dont know whare i am
p
"my wife left me"
I really hope I wasn't this annoying when I was 14
wow this thread is going to turn out good.

LOL
p
Then he will be banned
...maybe
I really hope that happens :P
q?
i think i need slep
Face it, if he did that...
Kipkat07_Scarf: I know a guy who decided to off himself by going to Mexico and jumping off a pyramid... dont know if it worked,
http://www.funnydictionary.com/img/entry_images/900/vr7KUExgR8r.jpg
You would not ban him...
No I wouldn't
Lol
BaconMane: do i need slep?
Rex_Mundi: wat

LOL
yup
It's probably okay if he uses a name that no one else does
ShizuKlaus: wleep is for the seak?

We used to have a rule that you couldn't do that

Hey Guise

<justin beiber pic here>
pony_3059: Sending spies into the GNAA is impossible sadly. They're like Anonymous. They have no leader and thus each member does what they want. Yes they can launch organized attacks but they are usually from a local area or website. Rarely is there ever a large scale assault and in the off chance that there is, they are rare, unpredicatble, and hard to prevent.
my sister got justin beiber perfume.
so...
lolwut
KrazyNoobs: i love you...
I asked her if she now smells like justin beiber.
i shel star new utub zreas
Why did I start a dolan riot... WHY?!!!
I love everyone here. Full homo
Is your sister hot?
I thought Justin Bieber wasn't cool anymore
ehts goin 2 b culld th uncl twoiloight show
There are plenty of bronies in the GNAA, me being one (I have no connection with the hack)
soulrider95: me too
I thought it was all about one direction now.
Haters hacked us
soulrider95:
Yeah
Meth[Television], too hot for you.
My cousin is obsessed with them
/me takes Kipkat07_Scarf to mah bed
more like hijacked
If I knew how to hack I would maybe join Anonymous because they hack the people who deserve it.
Hook me up with her ;)
^
Meth
=/
hahahaha
But I knew about it, and when I see what those Ns put up on this site, I was laughing, but at the same time, crying, because I just wanted to see the episode.
^
dude you're 14, don't be stupid
yay, I found a gun similar to the Hunting rifle :3
Only if you're rich.
You can't even get your friend's girlfriend out of your mind
Anon doesnt hack, they only DDOS....
oh wait
KrazyNoobs: wait... you KNEW?!!
We can talk about the latest episode now right?
Anonymous is good, GNAA is evil.
My sister is 16
soulrider95: thats what I meant
True
racist barn racist barn
goddamn are you people STILL going on about the hijack?
together we can racist barn
get over it already
Buytoast: looks like it
RACIST
ikr
BARN
I make $200k a year though, doesn't matter
13yay fireplace works
:I
Kipkat07_Scarf: Yeah, but everyone else in the GNAA hated the ones who were going to hack them anyway, they were the stupid ones that hacked.
DDOS is easy, hacking? near impossible.
Really?
Yes.
Through what? Modelling?
Thats "well off", not rich.
True.
most 'hacks' recently were just backdoors left open, no cracking or anything required.
Did we see apple Fritter in the latest episode, i dont think I saw her.
But if you are 14 making your own money -- more then your parents put together, it is all good
KrazyNoobs: so why U in teh GNAA
All they had to do was connect their ManyCam to the site by hacking it, and then they played our anthem while showing ChickenMan.
Theres well off, then theres rich, then theres "fuck you" money.
by the way, how did they even hack the site anyway? does an admin here know?
pony_3059: hijacked
Hijacked*
not hacked
Kipkat07_Scarf: For trolling idiots, not trolling bronies. I am a brony, and I would never do a THING to other bronies. They are mah bros.
it wasn't a hack
and it wasnt the site
now drop it
it was the stream
I am not lieing
kks
everyone, Drop it
"hacking it" lol
i need slep
KrazyNoobs: Space is 20% Cooler is our anthem
It was the stream.
rich is when your pulling in millions
it was silly mips security
Just, drop it
meh, same thing
Well, I came in at a MARVELOUS time :|
well off is hundreds of thousands
I NEED SLEP
Hey there, everypony!
/me : Okay
lol mips and security in the same sentence
then fuck you money is pulling in billions.
Ohai Polynomial
hello Polydunami
/me knocks out loGanN
:P
/me drags loGanN to bed
ok
lol
Kipkat07_Scarf: no u didny
nighty
Polydunami: u missed hangsman
*snuggles up to Polydunami*
Just to sum it up, I am a member of the GNAA, but I do not support hacking. I just crapspam IRC boards (not this one, I respect this one too much to do something like that)
pony_3059: nope its not, haking needs skill, Hijacking is taking over
That concludes our economics class of the day.
how did they hijack it then?
You mean where you guess letters, cachi01?
there is a difference now drop the convo pls
Because I know that as hangman
teach us about poor people
yep
magic
Polydunami: how did that fucking s got there?
You don't need to learn about them
They be poor.
so how bout dem sea ponies
Polydunami: I won two rounds :D
like broke college students
INCOMING!!!
Oh wait, I can do that
Just make sure you know it's illegal to be poor
There are automated programs that send 100 messages per second on any given IRC board, before I was a brony, I did that ONLY ONCE on here, but forgive me for that. That was long ago, I have almost no involvement in the GNAA now.
Is it too late for more rounds?
I used to be poor -- But I got myself where I am today
Broke college students are worse than poor people because they actually think they are going to accomplish something.,
Polydunami: eeyup
yup
0,5"GNAA"
dat fire
hahahaha
I told that to a few other friends
and they be mad.
0,5Calling that group an association is nonsensical.
KrazyNoobs, hpw about what heppan this morning
kk, thanks
Broke college students are worse than poor people because they continually complain that they're poor but they can still afford to go to school
What happened this mornin'
KrazyNoobs: wait
0,5It doesn't even deserve an acronym.
GNAA sounds like a angry sheep. GNAAAAAAA
G'day all what are we watching?
Except they can't
Everything about the name is nonsensical, BaconMane
0,5And KrazyNoobs that's enough out of you.
Or have enough credit to get a loan to go to school
BaconMane: But then news channels would say the name on television
they pay for it with loans
KrazyNoobs: was it u last year january?
BaconMane: Okay, I be quiet now
lol
ah the good ol' shizu fireplace
KrazyNoobs, spambots
and you don't need credit for student loans
If you have $20 in your pocket and no debt, you have more than like 35% of amercians.
BaconMane: I don't do that stuff anymore, that was over a year ago
now lets drop it
pls
/me goes to his happy box
0,5We don't need to hear about your supposed "hacking skills" or whatever or your involvement in some pathetic internet troll group.
I'm okay with dropping it.
0,5People are complaining.
/me goes to happy sphere.
lol
^^
i cant pay attention
I think it really depends what you are planning to major in
i cant sllep
its 32*c in australia atm
i cant think what happening
cool
35 over here
*mutes fireplace* *turns fans up full blast*
/me rolls his happy box down the stairs
lol
AHHH FUUUUUUU-
/me hits his head and faints
You guys are lucky in the southern hemisphere :|
<Insert circlejerk about philosophy, art, and english majors>
Yeah, as long as you don't do something dumb like liberal arts or philosophy or art history
u sure u want me to drop it? http://historylink101.com/ww2photo/atomic-bomb-fat-boy.jpg
lol
Boom
:D
Called it
beat me
:D
Polydunami: And why would that be?
At least that's what I keep telling myself anyway
:D
Meth please don't start that again
It's just obnoxious
High temps?
Okay :p
Almost word for word too
north > south
i need to SLEEEEPPPP oodbye mery crhrismas
because cold > warmth
0,5Okay
Buytoast: yup
you cannot prove me wrong
I don't think English is _that_ bad
But I like the cold, Poly.
13basement's done
0,5Now I am going to leave
I do
It is summer here in Australia.
I'd never major in it
Bye BaconMane!
0,5But the other mods and regulars will be watching
bye BaconMane
Bye BaconMane :)
So we better be good! :P
http://members.ozemail.com.au/~slacey/images/antarctica_map.gif
gooooodbye BaconMane have a goooood night
tho
cya BaconMane :)
always_watching.jpg
0,5If I get one more complaint about what's being said in here, we're going to have issues.
But it's not _completely_ useless career wise like philosophy
There are not enough jobs available for English majors unless you plan to teach it
0,5Understand?
Yeah, actually, I kind of prefer the cold air to hot myself
goodniye
13i guess everyone left mah map
/me is watching
cya baconhair
Never mind :P
Yes, Baconmane.
sorry ShizuKlaus, firefox crashed.
no pings? awwwwwww
just did some research on the gnaa...they declared war on us 6 weeks ago. I didn't even notice
bye
Even that is difficult to get into
they mad
What war?
And now I have it back up.
:S
DaringDerpy: They are stupid people, let's just drop it now, please.
STEM majors all the way
ok ^^
SO HOW BOUT THEM PONIES? HMMM?
lol
you're doing good so far, shizu :)
soulrider95: gaaaaaaaaaay
I think a good combo would be some sort of business major, english minor, some phycology, and religious studies.

*fixed
Welcome Kipkat07_Scarf
I dont think it needs to be fixed.
cachi01: yes.
I don't think it can be fixed
Buytoast: I prefer spicyness for flavors sake, not just to be hot. But if it isn't hot enough, the flavor can't save it. Tis a delicate balance.
welcome to the herd :)

Hey Neo

Just for fun?
:D
lol

Umm
I am trolling bro
I don't
Not a good idea
Kipkat07_Scarf, welp. Hope you don't regret it.
lol
If you were a real programmer
thigh tattoos sounds even more unhealthy..
I am a true Troll
Youd know how to change that
i would
Beeeeecauuuuse duuuuudeee.
but no
;)
Srsly.
Hair.
Seriously, I *will* accidentally ban myself if given op
I am going to regret the pain
lol
Can you ban yourself
That's pretty hard to do if you don't know what +b does
or kick yourself?
:P
i ranbow dash cutie mark tattoo on your thighs... yeah im seeing what Ninjazz is talkin bout
Yup

Dare you

I have 3 years to think about it though.

Kipkat07_Scarf: and you will regret when you try to remove it
RainbowDashSavior, ohgod
RainbowDashSavior: at least that one seems temporary
+kick All
What did he stuff in his underwear? :P

RainbowDashSavior: no, more detailed

hello ouo
I had some tutorials on the epic-chat website
No, I mean, you have to pay thousands to get it removed and it's painful as hell which i had heard from
Some more advice. Never get a tattoo in a language you don't understand
Ninjazz: i had a bunch of good rarity pics, but you didnt show your byrobowl-worshipping butt in here often enough
I can't kick anyone
SPIDER
ohai texasboykc09 :)

Neither do people who type "y" instead of "why"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz9uLp4ymA8&list=FLOYWgypDktXdb-HfZnSMK6A
haha
But typing 'why' requires the use of typing 'y'
I am currently laughing out loud.
The string literal contains the character literal
that's why I said instead of
:P
Remember that this is still a stream going

But it wouldn't be instead of!

ShizuKlaus: I wish I had minecraft :(
^^
twilight_sprinkle, would you believe that I /just/ saw that one a few seconds ago?
Ninjazz: where?
The first one I meant.
Shouldn't you actually be writing "why" instead of not typing the letter?
Who's streaming?

Gensokyo*
hello guys! :D
/me arranges teh blocks on top of texasboykc09 and pyrocatboy

valoreins, Starbucks is mainstream.
Kipkat07_Scarf, while using a Mac?
/me blocks fall on top of me
GabeMoist: hehehe

Hi valoreins

lol
@Kipkat07_Scarf do you have Gentoo?
In order to be a total hipster, you need to be in a far more obscure restaurant that still uses wi-fi, while writing a book on your Mac. It has to be running Linux, and it can't be Ubuntu, any of it's varients, Debian, or Gentoo.

RainbowDashSavior: I have ubuntu but I want to start using Debian soon
Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjGSMUep6_4
what are you? Penguin?
keep watching till you Install Gentoo
I feel like I'm missing out on some really big thing
But I can't make myself care enough to get past the first part of it
I guess I wouldn't mind Ubuntu. I guess that makes me a sellout to Canonical.
Lol
The first part is boring
I tried reading it twice
It gets exciting and confusing after
It was incredibly boring
I read through the entire thing once already. I'm trying to again because now I can understand it
any /g/entoomen in here?

can we start a google chrome vs firefox war in here?
Firefox is better. Kthx. :>
chrome wins. Game over
Maybe link the image rather than the google image page.
Nope.jpg
OH ITS ON.
agreed, firefox is better.
RainbowDashSavior: yeah let's not
chrome ftw
^
^^
:>
I seem to load pages faster with Firefox but that's just me
:P
How about we just all get into agreement than IE is worst.
:>
that*
Man I'm bored
naw IE is best
^
IE is the worst
^_^
I prefer Netscape
Opera all the way, baby
I prefer safari over IE. -.-
IE is the best piece of software in existance, kthxbai
Firefox has everything google chrome has, even without addons. Firefox also has a much larger add on community, and i dont decide which browser to pick based on a few millseconds of startup speed.
pwned.
firefox takes a ton of cpu
chrome takes way less
it takes 7% of mine
Lol, I think flashplayer is taking up all of my usage cause of the stream.
and i got an amd 955
one page on firefox is 20ish percent, which is about how much 7-8 tabs on chrome takes
Firefox is taking 00-02 atm.
20ish for me that is
Firefox eats up alot of cpu
Google supports CISPA.
:d
Chrome wins the internet. Nuff said.
13anyone still watching? roof going up :)
chrome and firefox both have their pluses and minuses
Shiza, why is the room on fire?! D:
and multipliers
ShizuKlaus: I wish I could help...I want minecraft so badly
My video is just a fire... .-.
firefox>chrome tho
in terms of everything but speed
speed And cpu usage
I always thought firefox was a lot easier to navigate through and I have always felt like it was a secure browser since I started using it.
thats speed too lol
and cpu usage is one of the most important things, and so is speed
Chromium is best browser
its not the same
one is the result of the other, but not the same
I have never had a single unwanted pop up with firefox. And firefox tends to warn me a lot better than google chrome does about malicious websites.
Pokecolt: odd, the opposite for me
alot of tabs RainbowDashSavior
My clarifications with the three is this: IE: Most compatible. Firefox: Best security. Chrome: Best for running on dinosaur PCs.
so do i, but 30 tabs in mozilla takes too much cpu for me
my glorious tabs
13hahaha ie compatibility
i usually have 35ish tabs on chrome
IE can run any website ever without problems. xD
I somtimes reach 100+ tabs
13except any site using reasonable CSS
75 is my max for tabs
10 for me
I have found sites that still make me use IE to run them.
It's really annoying.
:l
13yes because IE thinks standards are for the weak
13microsoft has always preferred to pretend standards don't exist

Maybe.
Lyra is gonna be piiiised
Welp, I'm goin nao
Bai gais
i was gone for the apple famly reunuon and it didn't record so i need to watch that soon
bai bai
Bye GabeMoist
I am listening to the raise this barn song.
Kipkat07_Scarf: so what, you actually like colonization?
Whoops, I forgot about LyraxBonBon
And saw bon bon and cloud chaser.
>.<
twilight_sprinkle: yes.
I ask again
The apple family is everywhere right?
Hello eerypony:)
Hey there, Sabershy
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: problaly
yea, thats what they said in episode 1
How the fuck is Applejack poor again?
Hi Sabershy :)
Kipkat07_Scarf: you realize colonization requires murder of innocents, as well as aggressive and unjust behavior?
Seriously
Spade, applejack is not poor obviously. She has purchased almost 3 barns worth of wood already this season.
2 during too many pinkies episode.
And 1 in most recent episode.
twilight_sprinkle: not always. In some cases the ruling party is benevolent & understanding to the colinists desires
AHAHAHA
twilight_sprinkle Soo can that include the mass murdering of the indians?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXZbQ0ZI4E4&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
Kipkat07_Scarf: there is always nationalistic elitism of a country that took over its new territories, they are always used for resources, and its people are always oppressed
easy there, we did a fare share of that also killer
considering how much acres of land applejack owns, and the amount of appletrees she harvests ever year, she should be a millionare
*sigh* what a day
I cant stand countrys who think they're the best
Fucking snobs
^
^^
yep..
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Cough*amer*Cough*ica*cough
You're no better than the rest of us asshole
The only superior country is Uncle Sam's own pride and joy.
me to
you bite your tongue
*Too
Kipkat07_Scarf: oh really, youre sayign britain is the best here
Uncle Sam didn't give his life for you to squander his beautiful gift.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvsX03LOMhI
Aw shit AMURIKA!
i wana make a pon. but i need to make my blanket first.... but blankets are so BORING nuergh
traior
Kipkat07_Scarf: it doesnt matter, that is nationalism, it is irrelevant where you are born
^
nationalism is even worse than racism as it puts one nation above all others
Of course I know how.
IE Germany
We wrested it from the hands of Communists who wanted us living in caves.
in fact they all said the opposote
But we showed them.
I bet'cha almost none will recall how the indians were murdered and pushed out of their country and forced to accept it.
twilight_sprinkle: move to my town...
MURIKA will stand tall and proud as the leader of this brave new world.
twilight_sprinkle: I have a hard time telling if Buytoast is beign sarcasting or dead fucing serious
Buytoast: Sure as soon as Obama fucking leaves town
N ALL DON TERK CRERP BOUT MURIKA'
...merika?
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: sarcastic
taoumi 'MURIKCA
MURIKA!!
N WE MURIKANS WLL RERISE UP N TERK ALL THUR LAND
Obama was chosen by the spirit of Uncle Sam himself to lead this country.
im back everypony
ERR THER LURND
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmEay7Ys83g&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
Don't you go defiling the rpesidency because of your racist ways.
TURK ERR JURBZ
Buytoast: Then Uncle Sam must have been drunk off his ass to pick him
DURKUR DURRR
Now arguing about countries? LOL
kipkat has a point on that
He couldent run a buisness properly
The only thing Uncle Sam gets drunk off of is patriotism.
As we all are.
Not me
stralia
Let us all drink deep from the waters of MURIKA and eat the Burgers of Oppurtunity.
YEAH STRAILIA
I'm from Canada. All we get drunk on is whiskey.
Kipkat07_Scarf: they have their own problems too, even if less perhaps, but its far from perfecy
BERTEN! WOO
For we will stand strong and lead all in Uncle Sam's honor.
Australia is a total bro though.
come from Equestria!
*I
Kipkat07_Scarf: also i recall you once saying that british people are smarter, and that is nationalism
Buytoast: as soon as we get decent government and out of debt
Is it warm there, Sabershy? :3
EREQWERSTERA!!
N TERK, N TERKK, N WE MERIKANS N NO CER BERT UR LEURD, N WE MERIKANS R THE FREE PERPLE OF ORU LEUURD
Funny thing is, here in Australia, only the Westerns and Outback people have Kangaroos. Only very few of us have kangaroos as pets on the East Coast
Although Kangaroos are everywhere in Australia
Why yes, Polydunami. Yes it is. :3
Debt is merely the price of our superiority.
true
Buytoast: More along the lines of stupidity
Kipkat07_Scarf: but in terms of higher education, its actually one of the best countries
i was not talking to buytoast
We've saved the world so much that our enemies are using money in their latest tactic.
I was wondering because I don't see the ponies wearing much in the way of clothing :$
But we shall overcome.
Right... "saved"
twilight_sprinkle: but we could be doing better is all.
why would you buy toast? i know you can but i still don't understand why
Because all toasters toast toast.
Er, toast BREAD.
Kipkat07_Scarf: thats not at all what you said though.
Polydunami: Its like saying is it warm at that nudist beach... >_>
We won the Revolutionary War, the War on Terror and the War of 1812 all by ourselves!
and preetaosted toast tastes funny
We can handle a little tab.
Australia is best because of the spiders.
Uncle Sam will see us through.
But Equestria isn't a nudist beach... is it? O_O
You mean like we "saved" those people in Iran?
Polydunami: a huge one
If they die, Uncle Sam willed it.
Buytoast The French helped us with the Revolutionary War.
LIAR
Anyone here from Perth?
Polydunami: We... have... fur...?
Buytoast: we also got the white house destroyed by the canadians.
kay bak to dragons nest. fun game that
Well, that's better
I mean, warmer
So the Canadians are our enemies as well now?
damn you Communism.
HELL NOW
So....stream or is the fire going to be on all night
*NO
Canadi-what now?
Oh hell naw
Kipkat Don't mess with the Canadians, they will kick your ass.
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Fire. I hope fire.
fuck Communism
I liek canada ;~;
but seriously, all countries as all people are equal.
The Communist Terrorists will not win so easily.
We will destroy them.
And we will be victorious.
twilight_sprinkle: except for those damn hippies. loljk
when people start imagining inequalities, thats where aaaalll the problems start
Sounds like a job for liberty prime eh Buytoast?
Australia tends to avoid conflict.
Welp, saying this now, We're gonna die by nuclear war
probably
It's NUCULAR.
:P
Buytoast jeez, Communist Terrorist, what else are they, Nazis?
The Nazis have already lost you silly goose.
Uncle Sam deemed them unworthy.
Also I hate Obama's wife she is so retarded
Now are we talking about Nazis? O_o
My political views align heavily with socialism
agreed spade
And we don't need a Liberty Prime.
We need only Uncle Sam.
She has crap like suggesting to recycle old stuff to give as gifts
And our MURIKAN spirit.
Allo
Buytoast and apple pie.
Or eat healthy, when she has a fucking gigantic ass
Hey there, Major
Socialism would be good if it worked.. but it doesn't

Oh, and she also got me some G4 welovefine shirts. It would be safe to tell her the G3 sucked, but I will tell her I love the shirts, because, of course, I do.
mailorder business really sucks right now. no one orders anything anymore since a week ago
She got me a 20% cooler shirt and a red 20% cooler hoodie, along with a Pinkieception shirt. :)
brb, gonna go thank the crap outta her
something is wrong with this chat. the app freezes every few hours
00,02DaringDerpy, yeah, lightirc isnt the most stable of clients
00,02but theres technicall reasons why we use it
DaringDerpy: If I were on the PC, I would give you a nice cracked version of mIRC.
I have one, XAX
00,02why mIRC? hexchat is free
desmon the moon bear
00,02hexchat > mIRC
but...I want it with the stream and all
Phase4: b-but... muh paid client
00,02free and cross platform
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQnU5nSReNA a typical day in soviet russia
/me 00,02scoffs at XAX and is purchased software
lol
IRC is interesting, I love how customable it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhHVHhN7guQ&t=7m07s ALLONS-Y
lol
i love g1
00,02the irc protocol is quite simple
ohwait I'm getting a laptop if I can pick one.
00,02XAX, you could start your own channel
Phase4: 2lazy
00,02but its litterally /join [channel that does not yet exist]
+v My pingas is sized of god -v
Phase4: Yeah, I know. I just don't want to be the one guy "Join my channel join my channel hey have you seen me channel you should join it"
00,02XAX, thats the bit i don't get, how channels get users
00,02KrazyNoobs, i forgot about that XD
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhHVHhN7guQ&t=5m20s lolwat
00,02only ever made one and it's not used for much
PonyChat is fairly advanced, in my opinion.
Phase4: dsauce happened from mass invite and the people that came never clicked quit I guess >_>
00,02by 'not used for much' i meen its there for BerryPunch to join and dump kick messages
00,02XAX, that can also happen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhHVHhN7guQ&t=5m58s WAT
Phase4: Thinkpads are the only laptop computers are allowed on the international space station.
lobbyism
00,02XAX, ...why?
Phase4: I dunno. Because MUH IBM?
With mIRC, you can use color (which I will not do at the moment, because it is against the rules. Ctrl + K, you know)
00,02i meen thinkpads arent bad laptops but still... why
They look pretty solid.
00,02IBM doesnt own the thinkpad trademark anymore
this will not change before we have private spaceflight
00,02sold it to lenovo
oh.
what does IBM do now then? :|
00,02while they are a bit more expencive, before being sold thinkpads were exceptional laptops
>zecoya
00,02XAX, buisness and high performance computing
00,02plus some other things
Oh, and we have a name for S3E10! :) (i will not say it... you know... spoilers?)
00,02they're still heavilly into research, as evident by watson and other such machines
Phase4: I've heard about the zecoya or whatever it is. Other than that, nothing else.
a good thing about ibm notebooks is trackpad
and they have it on lenovo
00,02"In 2011, IBM gained worldwide attention for its artificial intelligence program Watson, [...]" it's funny because watson isn't an ai
A cool think about thinkpads is the clitoramouse on the keyboard.
...as its called.
00,02it's a fancy search engine
XAX: I hate that thing...
THING
colour off
I'm Badk
XAX, https://xkcd.com/243/
Back*
Phase4 powered down.
/me eyes are burning from too much white
ouo, older thinkpads were built really well, cast aliminum frames and everything
LOL Nipple mouse. XD
Phase4: lel'd
yeah ibm was better
IBM's also doing a bit of hardware research
look up 'Racetrack Memory'
Brb, again
Merry XAXmas!
cya Uboa-san
Phase4: How did you conjure up that comic link so fast? .-.
really wierd type of memory, stores information magnetically on a loop of metal, putting current through the metal causes the magnetization to move along the path
XAX, google
see what I did there
Mutterguy: HA! You too c:
XAX, neat trick: xkcd keeps the comic text in an invisible div, google indexes the contents of that div
you can google xkcd comics by their text
Phase4: >magnets
ThinkPadState.net
how do they work
XAX, via some really wierd math
really wierd math that no one explains right
Phase4: Did you see that programming language comic I linked you on steam from /g/?
yeah
Is it accurate? x3
i actually replied in steam :P
I didn't see. :c
link it again and i'll remake the reply
well, brb in half an hour
b-but... the thread probably 404d, and I'm off MUH PC...
I'll try find it...
its a cyanide and something comic
i forget what its called

Aww
was gonna be best fruitcake ever
You will just have to be best fruitcak. :>
fine
XAX, PHP
TO GOOGLE!
you saw all 4 slides?
Phase4: I found it on /g/. It might have been edited there. >le 4chan exclusive face
i've seen the edited comic before
the smaller one is just more common
2 new notes
Secret Santa resulted me having +1 pony. Hasbro's combs are terrible.
http://derpy.me/nEY5d
^ true story
Phase4, ... so true...
oh lol
so true about java
programing is still a young discipline, we're still figuring out the best ways to build things
and i totally didnt have to google discipline >_>
ouo, true about most all languages, java just sucks
all languages have ridiculous things :D
because peoples made them
Phase4: MUH connection drop
Find it?
nope
Phase4: :c
critisizing programing languages can be dificult because you always have some jerk who things the language is awesome
and comes up with things llike "a good programer can work in any language'
also that greatest trolling about 'functional and imperative' way to programming :D
and as i said, young discipline, lots of opinion still
XD
i'm still working out the distinction betwene the two
Phase4: >C#
http://ponilauta.fi/int/src/13303713909052.png/pinkie_pie%20yaranaika.png
C# java
XD
C# > java but thats not exactly dificult
really honestly i never seen good interface on java
Phase4: Is there a "hardest" language?
without bugs
>assembly
>machine code
XAX, define hardest
and always is so slow
as fuck
Phase4: don't know shit captain
theres a reason its called that btw
lol.
Who would make that...
ikr :D And it turing complete
XAX, some guy, was essentially for teh lulz
wanted to see how small a vm he could make
why not
Phase4: Did he completely finish it and use it in something? .-.
200bytes later he had brainfuck
i love do some code with turing machine :D
for fun
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck
XAX, its REALLY small, 8 opcodes
also The Emperor new mind
greatest book i think
i ever read
should read that
my father give it too me
he such a great man... i hope i'll be him sometime
i plan to impliment brainfuck using mod_rewrite to prove that its turing complete
sounds fun :D
i've got the HOW figured, but getting around to writing it is a diffrent matter
lots of fiddly regex
also just Try and do math in mod_rewrite, its insane
Phase4: lol examples on wiki. That code just to print "hello world"
XAX, yeah XD, its got to incriment until it gets the value of each char
later Gold_Dereindeer
Turing-completness is such an interesting concept
if something is turing-complete it could in theory simulate a universe, given enough time and memory
also if you manage to write a universe simulator in brainfuck then you win life
Hey everypont..okay then, Phase4
ohai Serenity
Ohai Serenity
also this is beautifull http://www.google.com/doodles/alan-turings-100th-birthday
Ohai Serenity :)
its a turing machine : D
Reinforcement arrives, and Phase just says about universal stuffs
/me noms on cake
Phase4: http://boards.4chan.org/g/res/30106013
Serenity, we were talking about turing-completeness, by which i meen i was talking and the channel was otherwise silent
XAX, apple and MS refused to suport webm
Back!
i imagine the mpeg consortium were around with some big cheques, just to be safe
Welcome back Uboa-San :)
plus the whole DRM thing which is a faulty argument either way
Wow, wow....just...wow
i'd be ok with everything suporting h264 but there are licencing issues which prevent firefox from doing so
Just realised I could zoom in thr webpage and I get better display on this website
Serenity, o_O
/me facedesks into his cake
Originally, I had a lot of spare space
Phase4: I don't even get it but I lol'd at the squabbling http://boards.4chan.org/g/res/30104172
i'm certin they are trolling
hai guys
well, some of them are trolling
ohai Chrysalis
meh i'm too lazy to programming for money
Ohai Chrysalis :)
so i do it fun :D
then i'm not lazy :\
hai Phase4 and MLP_Brovakiin
Ohai Chrysalis
Lua is pretty confusing at first
im the best fruit cak ever!
Mainly because organisation is a HUGE issue
Phase4: I figured, because 4chan.
so i got many not complete pieces of code on random languages :D
but it's still fun
Lua is quite an easy language as far as scripting is concerned
Lua feels like its for a certin type of software that i just never seem to use
as such i've never actually used it
It is, compared to a lot, but you have to remember all the tabbing after the if statements and such
Phase4: use computercraft in minecraft
lua controlled turtles <3
Chrysalis: Yeah, that's basically my full use of Lua
turtles!
Chrysalis, i was actually looking at using redpower computers
6502 FTW!
who likes fruit cake? :P
aniderp|bestfruitcak, /)
Phase4: also good, RP is 1.4.6
Phase4: That uses BIOS, doesn't it!?
and is in the DW20 pack on FTB
im the best ever!
Serenity, o_O
im sooo good :P
Also Scala is new and hipster
Serenity: yes it does, it fully emulates the CPU
ifyouknowwhatimean
which is how you can get entirely new OS's for it
FORTH is a really wierd language
at the same time its kinda neat
guiys... wish me luck about getting pony and zelda stuff tommorow!
and maybe pokemon
Chrysalis: Seen Star wars on FComputercraft?
http://boards.4chan.org/g/res/30106018#p30106404 lol
yup
i'm never tried it
You need a tonne of monitors, but in creative it's fine
<3ing the new updates to redpower. tubes in frames. the world will never be the same :D
Actually, what's the difference between a normal computer and an advanced computer?
colour
also i love PDP assembler, this is so neat and fun!
Chrysalis: Colour? That's it?
the advanced ones have the ability to change background and text colour
bad thing
yup
Ahhhh
i want to write a PDP emulator
I thought you just meant the golden case colour
got bored when it turned out theres a lot of different PDP's and boot disks are anoying to find :(
Phase4: Can't you just copy/pasta some code?
uh... not sure what you meen
Phase4: If you're still talking about minecraft (knowing my luck, you aren't)
nah he aint talkin about minecraft...
PDP emulator in minecraft would be godly
lawl
Phase4: enjoy :P
i wnat to see it :D
actually... wonder how hard it'd be to build a PDP in minecraft
Java probably couldn't handle it
Phase4 do it do it do it
redpower makes it a lot denser
the hard part would be balancing how much to do a tick
i want it "D
Thing is with me, the only thing that keeps Minecraft installed on my system, never mind play it is mods
as soon as you get any amount of automation TPS drops
oh yeah
vanilla is so far behind what the modders are putting out
They've got so much shit to do if they are gonna get someone who played since Alpha 1.0.0 back
who wants a peice of me? :P

i hate notch for java, but i love him for beard
I feel bad for Dinnerbone, he had to fuck around for a week to try and fix that shitty lighting bug, in vain
Lighting isn't even that hard to code in a game like that!
really someone tell me about one interface app on java without shit glitches in it
and it's mostly slow as hell
C# never did it with his .net
thats why net > java but still sucks :P
i got some neat jello c:

Phase4: TEEHEE

some classic need here
AI - Already Intoxicated
it's a concept film about the philosophical implications of robots becoming self-aware by experimenting with viruses that act like drugs
sounds fun
but in the end, cell phones become the dominant movers and shakers in the market, crushing PCs
ya mean like now
so in the future, everyone satisfies their sexual urges with tiny semiconductor cubes that emit holograms
DoYouWantToGetHigh: That is a horrific future
it's like THX 1138, but without the creepy dick vacuum and blad dancing black people in the nude
phone are an abomination now
I hate phonwa
phones*
exactly
but they will never replace desktops
or will they
it's also a nod to how the illuminati's power can be bought and sold through wars
DUN DUN DUUUUNNN
nope
photonics > everything
cause a phone can never be as powerful as a desktop
hey look, insane conspiracy theories
The most portable computer is a PDA
those still exist?
They aren't bad, but they are outdated as fuck
it's not insane
/me puts on a tinfoil hat
it's accurate
hey guys

Heya, alexxm
screw portable

hey santaduck you'll be better off trepanatng
how are things SantaTheDuck and Serenity
DoYouWantToGetHigh: so, illumaniti existing/ running everything from behind a meta physical curtain, isn't insane?
the CIA made a brain scanner thatcuts through aluminum by excavating alien tech from Hell
My internet deserves to die for being slow, other than that, fine
not at all
it's more sensible to think that our right's haven't eroded completely
HA HA HA HA HA HA
SantaTheDuck: Where do ya live?

DoYouWantToGetHigh: Australians are britfags
Oh shit, I'm a britfag
britfags? .-.
um I was implying that new zealand has a greater attachment to the UK than australia
this is not a bad thing
I was speaking historically
At least the NZ's spell correctly :p
look at events like the falkland island war and kultur of the two states
colour, honour, humour
Serenity: +1 to that
hey look, correct spellings of things
>implying English is inherently correct only in GB
yes
thats because english is from england
not bastard english
DoYouWantToGetHigh: well I spelt like that, in the US, when I was in 4th grade and told I was wrong
so, yes it is correct
you disregard the fact that language assumes regional differences
yes, yes I do
it is only correct as per the region of imposition
What about that stuff they speak in what's it called. Welsh.
you assume that being somewhere else means it can be different
if its named the same, it should be the same
thus i reject your complex of long gone british supremacy
your empire is a mere commonwealth tackered to the States

Am I the only one that thinks the title of the next poni episode is absolutely_distgusting.jpg?
!cd
Episode 10 of season 3 "Spike at Your Service" airs in 5 days, 2 hours, 36 minutes, 41 seconds (Dec 29 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
Hmm?
no
Spike at yer service
Oh my
I like the title
Oh.
considering how bad hasbro are at naming episodes
The one after that...
they should be classed as spoilers now
not the spike one...
didn't see it
does it involve things near or within RD?
I hope not
DoYouWantToGetHigh: >within
lol.
nu ha ha ha ha
made you laff
you're welcome
That was an extremely random topic change
as most should be
oh yeah, we are an empire, aren't we
you do realise no one likes you right?
yeah
nor you for that matter
that's the price of being WASPS i guess

britain is an island
goddamned attrition conflicts
cowvarkian: i have heard none of them actually used
well I don't live in the UK, so I wouldn't know
anglo-amerikan kultur exchange is like those odd cases where you're friends with a woman who had an abortion in college
yeah, no one actually uses those in real conversation
hi everypony
you have this feeling you understand why she's so unsettled at coat hanger jokes
there are so many things wrong with what you just said
moonslicer: leave while you still can
hi moonslicer
why cowvarkian abd hi chrysalis
Greetings moonslicer.
mostly because of him
I haven't met you before, but I nontheless offer you a warm welcome.
of who?
How are you?

cowvarkian: come now, i trust i didn't ruffle your feathers tooo much
you didn't at all
you were actually quite entertaining
you sure act like i did
cowvarkian i can handle this...
after all... im the biggist troll on the internet well my friends say so
good
you see, people who take the "you were fun" approach are just inwardly compounding their own disgust and putrid constipation of better responses
thats nice
not for you
cool story
ok ok break it up maybe if you can just start over!
brool story co
I don't think the majority of the bron y community can release grudges.
/me doesn't get grudges
despite their indoctrination of ideals
"whatever"

they still take things rather personally
though you'll probably say I do
i don't hold grudges
denial is not just a river in egypt
this makes me think of warm thoughts
its also a feeling
so, how bout those ponies
awesome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33eKeMbgCok
also, inb4 eww ponies
can we have a pony video on
I like Story of the Blanks.
i fried knot
Why aren't there more things like Story of the Blanks?
because you touch yourself at night
with your significant other, yes
and because I don't have a real answer
DoYouWantToGetHigh: of which I have none
boo hoo
MY GOSH YOU TWO BREAK IT UP
story of the blanks is how i got into this
no, just destroying the joke
moonslicer: never had one
...
you did a poor deconstruction
TROLOLOLOL
Na, keep going. This is humorous.
ikr jaymoo

well, it appears the anger is surging through jack cowavarkian
make sure to milk those udders

wouldn't want you to piss and moan more
zombie ponies are the best, and zombie pinkamena is awesome

Night gentlemen. Merry birthmas.

ok how about you two strip naked and run around saying im from the future!
I'm up for that
lol
sorry, im not gay
I'm sure you aren't
im not gay im a girl
nor am i a lesbian
sure you are
...
people who openly mock others for admitting their sexual orientation most likely have issues maintianing their own
your kidding right>
how did you know
DoYouWantToGetHigh: but I wasn't mocking
i fell in love with someone called micheal to bad my friend chelsiea too him away!
you were appyling sarcasm
i dont smoke
DoYouWantToGetHigh: as I do to most things
which is indeed a method of insulting another
doesn't mean I was mocking
i doubt that
well I wasn't mocking
They'll never catch up.﻿ NCIS has two guys on one keyboard, but little do they know that the hackers have three guys on one mouse.
:D
you might percieve it as that though
do i have to look at a fireplace for ten more hours?
sure
yep
if you're so sarcastic, what reason do i have in believing anything you say
hey hey i got a joke!
moonslicer, do you like bananas?
no
DoYouWantToGetHigh: none, you don't have to
why
im not a fruit person
they yum actually
i hate fruit
then how can i judge your claims accordingly
i love apples
i like bananas
and bacon
Hey i got a joke!
oh well, im reading too far anyhow
DoYouWantToGetHigh: *shrug*
ouo put them together
i sure do
apathy is not an excuse for insincerity
ok
what happens when a dragon lands on two people argueing!?
I really don't care
what's okay?
you're statement
*your
you seem like you do
hmmm
anyone know?
moonslicer, seks?
no
well i pass
death?
death seks?
Nothing! because the two people argueing would be turned into pancakes!!
so, death
zombie seks
ouo, Keep that shit out.
* troll face *
but nothing implies that the arguers states haven't changed at all
ya, pancakes, woohoo
moonslicer: dohoho you really got me there :p
so how can they be pancakes
is the dragon a worm hole from another universe?
its a joke
they commonly use exageration
aren't jokes supposed to be funny
it's a staple
if the dragon was fat then two ponys would not be able to lift it
if the dragon was heavy
i just have a picture from Dead Alive movie :D
theres your dragon pancake maker!
so the debaters are ponies?
my brother is half dragon half pony
everythings a pony
lel dat bad OC
horses
hmmm
if one's a unicorn pony he could stop the dragon with magic
but ponies aren't much related to horses
moreso to dogs i believe
ponies are horses :S
yea is the dragon sat on a unicorn horn it would break
im aware
damn typos
lol
A pony is a small horse[1][2][3] (Equus ferus caballus). Depending on context, a pony may be a horse that is under an approximate or exact height at the withers, or a small horse with a specific conformation and temperament. There are many different breeds.
mhhm
last part
did you get that from wikipedia
because i don't trust wiki
ok something really weird just got into my mind
nope >_>
he cheated
it looks like you left the source note numbers in there
ha, proof
you know i said i had a OC thats half dragon half pony right?
i have sources
in my mind
moonslicer: dat bad OC
no
if it's half dragon, that immedietly makes it bad
*spelling
not mine
whatever you say, george
he is nice
as bad as twilight possibly beecoming an alicorn?
DoYouWantToGetHigh: yes, that bad
...
ANYSWAYS

DoYouWantToGetHigh: that if twi became an alicorn the show would be ruined?
anysways? wtf kind of a word is that
mmm
if i was doing live stream, i would play dead space 1 through 2 , then play dead space 3 when it comes out
ANYWAYS
CNN BREAKING NEWS: brony civil war negotiations taking place in internet, more srs and respectful discussion follows

in other news, Israeli-Palestinian crisis still not solved
:(
Keep them to yourself.

So Jmo, what exactly did you find humourous about my previous conversation?
ya know what..
moonslicer: you won't like me when I'm angry?
i hope you dont go to my school

ok, i have to go play borderlands 2, bye

Brace yourselves, as control is impossible.

So much time.
KrazyNoobs hai again :D
Jmo: :D
People don't have a tendency to listen to roleplayers who enjoy Pepsi to the point of kicking others in the genitals.
Cola > Pepsi
exactly my sentiments, DoYouWantToGetHigh
DoYouWantToGetHigh: uh... wut?
my sister left because you two where argueing

You're just repressing the rage of drinking liquefied babbies.
Fight the powah.

So cola is liquefied babies? :D
HOCKEY EH

YEA BUCK DA POLICE

Ahhh
Coke made of rainbows

Coke was made with cocaine extract
I like coke :3
cocaine is made of rainbows and cupcakes
was used in hispitals
To liquify a baby, you have to liquify the bone, and the bone makes the entire thing taste more plain...
coke yes
:3
Just remove the bone before you liquify it.
it was also a favoured drink of the Nazis : (
DoYouWantToGetHigh: thats hilarious
ewwww baby eater
no srsly
EatingAndLiquifyingBabiesState.net
DoYouWantToGetHigh: I know you are
but it's just hilarious the very concept of it

DoYouWantToGetHigh Fanta was nazi product c:
YES
SOMEONE ELSE KNOWS
Thank you.
yawn
i read it
while ago
and saw some movie i can remember
See, Fanta was the replacement for Coke after Coca Cola GmBH pulled out stakes in Deutschland after the big wallop.
oh well i dont really want to look at a fireplace burning to hell so im out
hey look, wikipedia has that information
HQ in Georgia told GmBH to get the fuck out, but GmBH wanted to turn a profit.
Eating Babies is stupid... it is illegal, for one thing, and it is also very hard to find a baby supplier.

she was still...recovering
they could've flown down from the moon
you know, from doing ecstasy and rubbing pipsqueak too much into the carpet
the moon was just a large kidney stone of luna's
so still luna
A-well-a everybody's heard about the bird B-b-b-bird, bird, bird, b-bird's the word
so what, luna was just in rehab for being an alcoholic?

ah
that's the cosmic lottery son
duh guys
no clue
everyone knows that nazi from the moon
they invaded the moon before we did
that's why we filmed the landing because we knew we couldn't touch the surface
just ask the ruskies
don't ask me :\
remember the one that almost died from vacuum pressure?
I didn't think that inanimate objects could die
Yeah, he just happened to rip open his hermetically sealed suit outside by accident
In all srsness, the soviets really ganked their space programme to the macks.

another cold war
another war
ooohhhhhh snap

Well, we got one with the Chinese
yeah
we do a bit
btw, that trick is pretty annoying, i should stop (not even a trick)
except they're out largest trading partner
*our
thing is, they still have coal dust on their cities
cold war c: sounds fun
they're their own biggest ally and enemy
just imagine what's gunna go down when riots break out over here and the ethnic divisions in China starts to crack open
martial law, both ends!
then I'll go to *insert name of country that isn't either of those*
No snakes alive!
good luck

Good morning everyone! :)
why would I get colon cancer anyways
it's at the early signs they give you a 40 percent range
hey RaveBrony
if it's not one cancer, it's another
why would I get A cancer at all
cowvarkian, Australia!
its incurring agents lie in things we use everyday
ouo: too hot
not to mention the environs we inhabit
i would move here too if some shit starts growing up c:
cowvarkian hot but fun! There is so many wonderful creatures
canada's just the soft spot on the baby's skull

the fires of Hell burn hottest for those who do not take sides
well hell always did sound like fun
indeed!
if it even exists
all my friends would be there
if it exists
even then, you'll probably get stuck in some old guys version of heaven
try watching ponies there
hell is just a state of mind
I doubt I would get stuck in any heaven
and the grave an eternal thought
maybe fire is hot, but i'll be with pitchfork
an old man's heaven is a young man's hell
if it exists
the point is, hell will not be what you think it is. to me, the fear of dying is worse than any hell.
especially if you've been at that edge before
DoYouWantToGetHigh: old man heaven actually sounds fun
08,01 /win 13
your lfe does flash before your eyes
good to know
and all of that suspended fear and disbelief crashes down
i don't like how you belittle that experience
DoYouWantToGetHigh: I wasn't
I was sincerely saying that it was good to know
that is a problem for our children, or what's left of them, to decide
you mean the 2 billion or so kids?
>_ >
<_ <
I frankly wouldn't want to live forever. Suffer with my problems for eternity? No.
Mmmm, living forever? I wish.....
Living forever would suck
And who's going to keep me up forever? I may not even be able to work.
What if you got a life sentence in prison?
also internet did us free in information, there is no boundaries and boxes, if we got somehow fast matter transmission, physical boundaries will be useless too
you mean the deconstruction and restruction of particles?
Living forever is great if you're of perfect mind and body.
maybe but i know it's impossible
:\
i'm talking about the two billion or less people who will be alive once the world has succumbed to war, famine and other strain
if vertebrate life still exists after the first ICBM is fired, then science will pose some rather intriguing questions to mankind
O_o
as always, he will find a way to pervert inquiry to his own ends, replacing question with more inquiry rather than legitimate answers
so this is the topic we're getting into now
great
im not a fan of the gene roddenbury alliance thing
aww, you not first who thinking about it...
DoYouWantToGetHigh: I am...
then you're naieve
yeah, a bit
i didn't say that to be mean, it's just not likely
I know
I don't take offense easily
hello
The best way to cure imortality is to either jump in lava where it will melt every particle of you, or to give yourself an absolute SHIT TONNE of morphine to make you sleep for a long long time
*don't easily take offense
sounds interesting. who are you talking about?
cryogenics may be a solution
in which statement
but that's only been tested on dogs and limited cases of humans
not sufficient to sustain persons, and if so, technology can rejuvinate them
all your limbs wouldn't work after being frozen that long

*can't
Eugh, transhumanists.
Eventually, you would be able to move
Maybe with hydraulic joints
true
i think there is never be a 3d war, and i bet we never get a fast mattere transportation, the most real think for us - increasing life period
otherwise, you'd better not age faster than a rotten pear and have some good life support systems
I still think lava is the best cure for imortality
ouo: 3d war? What about the 3DS?
:D
or the cold dark depths of space, Serenity
I'm so bored right now
then go to sleep
there may be a third, fourth and even fifth war
shit will have to break like it usually does
and dephs of space is bullshit before with our life cycle
I can't go to sleep now, otherwise my sleep patterns of the next year will be affected
geopolitick and not enough resources contrive dangerous scenarios
isn't there this wonderful thing called mutually assured destrucion, DoYouWantToGetHigh
yes
clean again
oh, you're a communist
just like God intended
The day scientists find out how to make hearts and spines regenerate will be the day imortality and old dodgerness is cured
"if I can't afford it, it's worth nothing"
Serenity: hearts are easy
communism growing up from capitalism :S But we have never build it right
and never will be
thats because each time it was attempted, there was no capitalism to grow up from
that's the degeneration of socialism
DoYouWantToGetHigh: you know nothing about that
about what
i dont need to be an aconomics professor to know about history of nations and their politick
*an economics
*politics
i prefer politick and other teutonic expressions
you think you can project the history into the future? you think nations will be relevant in 500 years?
yes
please
you can't see into a crystal ball
most likely,there will be no nations for people to build
because there will be no people
lel
DoYouWantToGetHigh: Why? It's not cloudy or opague?
you are high, right?
not as high as you are
i'd not want to drink your kool aid nor smoke your crack

A basket contains 5 apples. Do you know how to divide them among 5 kids so that each one has an apple and one apple stays in the basket?
Here's what I would do
