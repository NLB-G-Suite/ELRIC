0,5Wat?
But I like fiddle songs D:
08,01Dark92Enigma: for it not to be a vapid word-repeating childish jaunt
0,5I didn't say anything >_>
08,01Bronysith: it was less than half-arsed
08,01it was quarter-arsed
08,01and that's being generous.
08,01except the fiddle in it
08,01that was cool.
https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6900657408/h677F2741/ how i see the moon
thats the whole song
maybe it was infinitesimally-arsed
08,01to be fair, the fiddle was awesome
Saturn theere rebooting rott
they got the same devs and everything
i admit it
Saturn: it just goes to show that the studio doesnt care at all for applejack
08,01Bronysith: i'll bring anything into anything
Hey everypony
/me 08,01brings a lion into a bar
/me slaps Saturn
08,01the barman says "you can't leave that lion there"
/me eats the lion that Saturn brought
Saturn do you want to stream?
08,01and i say, "that's not a lion, it's a giraffe"
08,01and the barman says "you're in the wrong joke, mate"
08,01so i take the lion, and try to find the correct joke
08,01we set out on an epic quest, through the metaverse of humour
08,01we run into many foes and tribulations along the way
Saturn: somehow TNG theme goes fittingly well with this
Oh hey, Saturn! :)
Saturn: the possibilities are endless
08,01*ba dum tsh*
Saturn: best joke ever
/me 08,01has the best extended metaphors

LT Data got stuck in a chinese finger trap
was FF8 that bad?
I really like it, but the magic system is bad
ill be honest, people are way too hard on Cloud...even though he does DREAD AND FUCKING ANGST
i mean Dart Feld pretty much went through the same shit, and even then some, and he doesnt dread or angst
those sound like things that would make one hate a character

Feel free to guess the phrase any time

08,01LC! i should come visit you when i come to america!
oh
um is there a stream?
0,5>_>
/me 08,01shall spank LC for being naughty
Saturn: be gentle with him
I LIKE CHEETOS
I dont think everyone here does.
0,5We have a phrase!
worst apocalypse ever
we are still alive
Homestuck is a web series that is basically... Too difficult to explain
LETS DO THIS
08,01yyyeEEAAhhhh
inb4 to easy
gotta go fast?
lol
This should be interesting
0,5New rule for you guys
I watched one episode, thats it. ive been meaning to watch more just because
0,5Since we're trying this out and all.
rules aren't fun, but ok
I think its a good series, thats why I watch it.
http://www.snotr.com/video/8965/
a'right
mmm
let's do this
okay back
lol
lolololol
this is ridiculous that's one a day now
0,5Everyone except Speccy can guess
0,5Now we begin
Wow
oh
A
Four words hunh
hmmm
I'll try whenever I get called I guess
*Huh
:o
:/
0,5Otakon, guess: _ _ _ _ - _ _ - _ _ _ - _ _ _ _ _ _
no
his name is ota
get it right
lelelelel
Yea
It's very long
uhmm
quiet cash
still kind of boring.
0,5Times up
err
I call next! :3
he's sure taking his time
0,5Nice one!
quadrocopter?
hooray!
0,5There are four E's
Nice
EEEE
hmmm
How many points do I receive?
thats a hexa
oh
none
Oh wow
stfu speccy
oh snap
lelel
Thats three you imbecile
0,5oops
this is my mini quad. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLVp-0Ih0yc
LELELELEL
ooh i know, its EEEE EE EEE EEEEEE
0,5there we go
I was about to say
no camera mount on the mini quad though
whats going on?
hmmm
0,5Cachi01, guess
T
i think i know 3 out of 4 of the words
cause theres obviusly a THE out there
T
I wouldnt use a raspi for flight control.
0,5There are two Ts
teen titans tower
0,52Ts
Why not?
0,5*2Ts
now that's surprising
i think i know 3 words too
dunno the last one tho
oh, nop nvm
0,5Bronysith, guess a letter
ooo, hangman
I would probably use vision tracking on it too
the flight control needs a very tight control loop for functions, and its probably going to be a ton of extra work to make a raspi work when theres other options that are quicker.
0,5There are no Bs
please*
use raspi for vision processing and a dedicated board for flight control
Good idea
The first word is stumping me
uhm ( )
0,5There is 1/24 guesses
Por que no los dos?
i think i know two possible ones for the first word
idk the last one
using arducopter.
0,5Bronysith, you cannot ask if a letter is taken, and then ask another one.

0,5Buytoast, guess a letter

Of course theres an O
yeah thats more than enough.
G
????? to the ?????????
hi
nuu, do the last word
h
I only run DJI flight controllers.
H!
silly dev decided to make his own language and didnt include any proper string formatting
00,10Alex, i would like to buy a vowle
goddamnit
What's DJI?
because why would you possibly want to format strings in irc scripts
Why did someone say my name?
Aw cool
I crashed a dji s800 into my trampoline
lol
00,10pffff turns
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHngxVg732U
lol
inorite?
@Neo, I get it
Thats not a cheap copter. Thats the dji professional series.
Why don't we have both?
0,5TheBucket, guess a letter
but I don't have the status to complain about these things
Umm
Um
U
"Um" is not a letter
U is
is mayonaise a letter?
That would be cool
Horseradish is not a letter either!
:<
NO U
You'd be surprised how much weight they can actually carry
0,5There are
Well I have an arduino and a gyroscope
0,5No U's
Do you sell a Pony Copter?
large LiPo batteries are not a problem.
FFFFFFFF-
dammit dont say h
Really?
Saturn: If i got chosen ._.
hah
yeah
*sepukku*
08,01twilight_sprinkle: there's an H in it, you silly
0,5That's 2/24 guesses.
0,5Twilight sprinkle, guess a letter
The lipo packs I run on my hexacopter weigh the same as my hexacopter itself
Fuck me
when it doesnt have the battery pack.
0,5no thnx
Hmm
0,5no N's
Saturn: that can be arranged
If you want a quadcopter, a decent battery would be about 250-300 grams.
08,01BroPony|MEDIC: excellent
Again dang
08,01i like indian food
Seriously?
0,5That's 3/10 guesses.
yes.
0,5Cachi, guess away
My mind can't handle it.
0,5"To" and "The" are correct
Saturn: I know of 14 restraunts that serve indian
damn
0,5You also nailed the H
last word dammiiiit
I run 6000mah lipo packs on my hexa and get a solid 15 minutes of flight time for each pack.
08,01L
wait...
08,01no, damn, P
Nice
08,01doggamnit
Saturn hush silleh filleh
0,5Buytoast, if you think you have it.
On the s800, I run 2x 6S 6000mah packs
I think I may
for 20 minutes of flight time
/me 08,01isn't good at waiting his turn
goddammit
Head to the Engine
0,5Wrong.
now i dont know the last one
hmmm
WRONG
Those are massive packs, but the s800 is a massive copter.
shit
0,5otakon, guess a letter
its not that simple.
?
08,01otakon: it's because you touch yourself at night
You need a lot more than just an arduino
dammit two l's i bet
lol
0,5There are no L's
08,019instead of me)
I need motor controllers too, right?
hmm
welp
Get a KKMulticopter board
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
0,5That's 4/10 guesses.
its cheap and has everything.
that first word ain't "hell"
0,5Saturn, guess a letter.
08,01HOW IS THERE NO ELL
lol
i want guess
Seriously?
These disconnection are getting troublesome
0,5Saturn?
0,5You going to guess?
for a quality DJI quad with a Naza Flight controller is $420
08,01oh right
dammit still last word
$230 of that is the Naza flight controller.
08,01have we had A yet?
no
i know the first
0,5There are no As
0,5That's 5/10 tries
OH COME ON
fuck
08,01goddamnit
Could I use Jaguar controllers?
that's ALL the vowels you idgit
08,01cans.wav
*yay*
Or would those be too haevy?
mmmmmmmmmm
helllpp
0,5otakon: there is yet another vowel
"I" hasn't been asked iirc
We still have Y
I GOT IT
0,5Anyone want a turn?
no you don't
I do
I dont
0,5Are you sure?
LIES
for $190, you can get the quad frame, arms, motors, motor controllers, and props
inb4 sprunkls won
0,5Huh, you got it right.
"Props"?
propellers
dufuq
http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Heirtotheempire.jpg
well shit, i was thinking heil to the Empire
wat

Gah

0,5I'll make a phrase.
okay
is is "Shizuka is best pony"?
DENIED
*it
I think the fun would be to figure it out myself :P
Or buy a Naza, which is like the best easiest plug and play system you can get.
(I hope)
0,5Intermission!

I actually had a free forum site half done.
Lol
oh
http://leopurofriki.deviantart.com/art/Rainbow-Dash-passive-PNG-306420258
why?!
every free forum would run punbb all running off of one main codebase.
13because there's a proxying spammer that needs killing
lol
individual sqlite isolated databases
http://www.forumotion.com/
ive been awake for 27 hours :) :P :D 6_9
13yep proxying
+b *!*@199.255.psz.rzl
/me puts on his good pony hat
each forum would be allowed to install plugins and such
13wow you're stupid
and a ton of themes.
wait, what's happening?
lol
How?
oh great -__-
One that didn't run on BB
I don't know
Call the cyber police
I no see spammers
Backtrace it
----________----
guyys i cant mov
lol
Something that was more modern. Didn't require any BB codes, was much more friendly. Nicer organization
ok :3
I like punbb because its simple and lean.
And Appew Fwittews
/me knits a pony into his fabulous scarf
you can use a wysiwyg editor... but lots of people prefer bbcode.
okay
Why do you want to avoid it?
It's an awesome server.
I don't mean a wysiwyg either
/me dies

I got my sister a crap ton of makeup
But I personally think that they are going to make Ep10 of Season 3 amazing, have a large waiting time until the other three, and, hopefully, make an epic three-parter halfway through the wait for Season 4. This is probably far from the truth, but it still may be possible.
i got my sister some headphones

dafak
why did you make one?
kafad
No one wants to join a forum that doesn't even have any posts
Because Spyro Forum needs more competition or something

13yay fireplace works
:I
DDOS is easy, hacking? near impossible.
Really?
Yes.
Thats "well off", not rich.
most 'hacks' recently were just backdoors left open, no cracking or anything required.
Did we see apple Fritter in the latest episode, i dont think I saw her.
All they had to do was connect their ManyCam to the site by hacking it, and then they played our anthem while showing ChickenMan.
Theres well off, then theres rich, then theres "fuck you" money.
***Stormy really overestimates my gullibility
Hijacked*
not hacked
it wasn't a hack
and it wasnt the site
now drop it
it was the stream
***Neotyguy40 would like to know how one does the three asterick thingy
I am not lieing
kks
everyone, Drop it
"hacking it" lol
i need slep
It was the stream.
Just, drop it

I NEED SLEP
Hey there, everypony!
/me : Okay
then fuck you money is pulling in billions.

lol
nighty
*snuggles up to Polydunami*
Just to sum it up, I am a member of the GNAA, but I do not support hacking. I just crapspam IRC boards (not this one, I respect this one too much to do something like that)
/me is very gullible
how did they hijack it then?
there is a difference now drop the convo pls
Because I know that as hangman
teach us about poor people
yep
magic
You don't need to learn about them
They be poor.
like broke college students
INCOMING!!!
Oh wait, I can do that
Just make sure you know it's illegal to be poor
I used to be poor -- But I got myself where I am today
Broke college students are worse than poor people because they actually think they are going to accomplish something.,
yup
0,5"GNAA"
hahahaha
I told that to a few other friends
and they be mad.
0,5Calling that group an association is nonsensical.
kk, thanks
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America ?
Broke college students are worse than poor people because they continually complain that they're poor but they can still afford to go to school
Except they can't
Or have enough credit to get a loan to go to school
they pay for it with loans
lol
and you don't need credit for student loans
now lets drop it
pls
I'm okay with dropping it.
0,5People are complaining.
lol
i cant pay attention

IE is the worst

I prefer Netscape
Opera all the way, baby

IE is the best piece of software in existance, kthxbai

speed And cpu usage
thats speed too lol
Chromium is best browser
its not the same
one is the result of the other, but not the same
i usally have 30 tabs open daily, its not much of a problem for me
my glorious tabs
13hahaha ie compatibility
IE can run any website ever without problems. xD
I somtimes reach 100+ tabs
13except any site using reasonable CSS
10 for me
I have found sites that still make me use IE to run them.
It's really annoying.
13yes because IE thinks standards are for the weak

They look pretty solid.
00,02IBM doesnt own the thinkpad trademark anymore
00,02sold it to lenovo
oh.
00,02while they are a bit more expencive, before being sold thinkpads were exceptional laptops

00,02XAX, buisness and high performance computing
00,02plus some other things
00,02they're still heavilly into research, as evident by watson and other such machines
a good thing about ibm notebooks is trackpad

ouo, older thinkpads were built really well, cast aliminum frames and everything
LOL Nipple mouse. XD
IBM's also doing a bit of hardware research
look up 'Racetrack Memory'
Brb, again
Merry XAXmas!
really wierd type of memory, stores information magnetically on a loop of metal, putting current through the metal causes the magnetization to move along the path

programing is still a young discipline, we're still figuring out the best ways to build things
all languages have ridiculous things :D
because peoples made them
Find it?
and comes up with things llike "a good programer can work in any language'
and as i said, young discipline, lots of opinion still

really honestly i never seen good interface on java

well theres esoteric languages like brainfuck
lol.
ikr :D And it turing complete
why not
200bytes later he had brainfuck
for fun
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck
greatest book i think
i ever read
should read that
my father give it too me
he such a great man... i hope i'll be him sometime
i plan to impliment brainfuck using mod_rewrite to prove that its turing complete
i've got the HOW figured, but getting around to writing it is a diffrent matter
lots of fiddly regex
Turing-completness is such an interesting concept
if something is turing-complete it could in theory simulate a universe, given enough time and memory
also this is beautifull http://www.google.com/doodles/alan-turings-100th-birthday
its a turing machine : D

plus the whole DRM thing which is a faulty argument either way
Wow, wow....just...wow
hai guys
meh i'm too lazy to programming for money

Lua is pretty confusing at first
Mainly because organisation is a HUGE issue
but it's still fun
Lua is quite an easy language as far as scripting is concerned
Lua feels like its for a certin type of software that i just never seem to use
as such i've never actually used it
It is, compared to a lot, but you have to remember all the tabbing after the if statements and such

colour, honour, humour
hey look, correct spellings of things
>implying English is inherently correct only in GB
yes
thats because english is from england
not bastard english
aka american english
you disregard the fact that language assumes regional differences
yes, yes I do
it is only correct as per the region of imposition
you assume that being somewhere else means it can be different

Did they help the South win AK-47s?
Yeah, I thought not.
both
no clue
they invaded the moon before we did
that's why we filmed the landing because we knew we couldn't touch the surface
just ask the ruskies
don't ask me :\
I didn't think that inanimate objects could die
Yeah, he just happened to rip open his hermetically sealed suit outside by accident
another cold war
another war
ooohhhhhh snap
night. :)
Well, we got one with the Chinese
yeah
we do a bit
except they're out largest trading partner
*our
they're their own biggest ally and enemy
just imagine what's gunna go down when riots break out over here and the ethnic divisions in China starts to crack open
martial law, both ends!
then I'll go to *insert name of country that isn't either of those*

wouldn't you normally die if you get colon cancer?
early stages are reasonably fought
it's at the early signs they give you a 40 percent range
if it's not one cancer, it's another
why would I get A cancer at all
ouo: too hot

even then, you'll probably get stuck in some old guys version of heaven
try watching ponies there
I doubt I would get stuck in any heaven
and the grave an eternal thought
if it exists
especially if you've been at that edge before

good to know
and all of that suspended fear and disbelief crashes down
i don't like how you belittle that experience
I was sincerely saying that it was good to know
we won't achieve immortality in our time
that is a problem for our children, or what's left of them, to decide
>_ >
<_ <
you mean the deconstruction and restruction of particles?
maybe but i know it's impossible
:\
O_o
great
then you're naieve
yeah, a bit
i didn't say that to be mean, it's just not likely
I know
I don't take offense easily
hello

cryogenics may be a solution
in which statement
but that's only been tested on dogs and limited cases of humans
http://humanityplus.org/
*can't
Eugh, transhumanists.
Eventually, you would be able to move
Maybe with hydraulic joints
:D
then go to sleep
there may be a third, fourth and even fifth war

clean again
oh, you're a communist
"if I can't afford it, it's worth nothing"
no, everyone would be too poor to afford immortality
thats because each time it was attempted, there was no capitalism to grow up from
that's the degeneration of socialism
*an economics
*politics
i prefer politick and other teutonic expressions
yes
please
