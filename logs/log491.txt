03Asize = size(A);
03for(x=0; x<Asize; x++)
03if (sum(B(:,x)) == 1)
03C = [C x];
03end
03end
03I think that might work? o.o
DeathStar: why cant they make the pew noise in space?
in space, no one can here you "pew"
There is no air for the vibrations to reach your ears
hello.
Rainbow_Crash: there's no air for the sound to travel through
o hai WallDives
Hey there WallDives :)
thats not how you do FOR LOOPs in matlab
it
s not C
03then
Damn, the Heat are not letting up
03how do you do for loops
they invented their own syntax
03which is?
help/g00gle/coursenotes
i hate space movies
but nvm who needs physics when you can have the blues brothers chase sean
03sig
03*sigh
ohai DeathStar.
jappleack: all of them?
I want to see The Blues Brothers on here
hi WallDives
yes all of them
Polydunami: same
I voted for that movie
jappleack: so you've seen all of them?
03wait
03for k=1:R <- the frick?
Speaking of space movies, Prometheus. I am dying to see it.
03that was simplefor.m
03that my teacher did
03for k=1:2:R
for 1 to R
StupidSexyCJ: ikr?
spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
for 1 to R in steps of 2
lol
maybe?
03well how would I do the equivalent of what I did in C-syntax
Well, I voted B movie on Blues Brothers, but still
03I just need it to repeat using variable x
no i havent seen all but i just hate the space genre
03while x is less than ASize
I just watched Alien 4 to prepare for it
jappleack: ^-^ don't worry it's ok if you don't like space movies
（￣へ￣）
03such hostility
DeathStar: correct me if im wrong, so you mean that because sound is vibration, then how can sound traval through space if there is nothing to vibrate thus traval?
Wait, wait, wait
Space is a genre?
sci fi
i mean
Rainbow_Crash: pritty much yeah
Yeah :3
DeathStar: i sound like an idiot trying to sound smart LOL
Rainbow_Crash: naw you just sound like a smart person who has troble explaining things useing proper english
did anybody else get grossed out by the changeling queen in the last mlp episode?
meh
i forgot her name
I like Chrysalis, most huggable bug ever
I can't read with out my glasses
^
well, except for the evil part
Chrysalis wasn't so bad imho
Yeah
she is nasty with the holes inside her
03for x=1:Asize <- I suppose this might work?
freaks me out lol
03loop from 1 to Asize
03using x
03hm
Deathstar: the awkward moment when english is the only language i can speake :P derp
speak*
ok, this is complete garbage.
sorry death
What do you mean, WallDives?
>Last in league >Quarterfinals of US open cup.
03OH HECK YES
>.>
03It actually worked
03LOL
jappleack: I like gross-looking bugs :D
lol
03though apparently you have to use 'string' instead of "string"
what the hell.
WallDives: something wrong?
Which sport is this?
Soccer.
futball
Rainbow_Crash: yeah most people who's only language is engish can't use it right all the time (one exaple of that is me)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPnqmbvPv40 Welcome to the eighties ;)

I'm sorry, I goddamn hate it when people call each other gay based on what they like
is anyone streaming?
Rainbow_Crash: I know a couple of regulars who are from ausy but I'm from new zealand
Polydunami: I know that feel. Especially when it comes to this.
my life every day: wake up from dad yelling at me, browse the webs, play videogames, sleep then repeat
Polydunami: you gay because you have a different opinion to me!
Yeah, yeah
yeah, I hate that...
jappleack: preach it brother
although not too many people say it to my face.
jappleack sounds familiar to mee
DeathStar: my dad is NZ thats why my name is Heremia
lol
We need some smooth jazz.
Hey Ninjazz, I have some eighties
Rainbow_Crash: ah i see

/me goes to Polydunami's link anyway
SO SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTH
my sister wouldnt let up about it, she refused to even give it a chance before bashing it and me for watching it, so I forced her to listen to me recount the history of MLP and the bronies while we fixed a fence
although the best I could come up with your be something like Jazzy NYC 99'.
/me slides around the chat on how smooth the jaz is
would^
:3
who wants to hear a sad story
not me.
My bro will never be a brony. He has listened to 3 episodes and 2 songs and some other stuff. He didn't like (So he say's)
thats what life is for.
jappleack: does it involve puppies?

Phase4: Not even a hug is gonna cheer me up. I've had the game for a couple of days now and I haven't been able to play once. I could put the game on my dad's computer when I'm over at his place but he doesn't need to see what my username is and see who I play with :|
Waaait...

Recently, I've been able to finish Touhou 9
something you dont expect but then it rapes your eardrums
With Marisa. Yaaaaaaaay
Hey Phase4, I'm trying to add the server you were on to favourites. Unfortunately, my game is wigging out due to lag, so I'm having issues. Could you give me the IP?
Spell-of-Gaming: My God. Er...which one was that again?
Spell-of-Gaming: Oh yeah, PoFV.
Spell-of-Gaming: How do you deal with Komachi and Aya? They always stonewall me.
I've reached Episode 9 with Cirno on Easy Mode.
00,02http://www.ponyfortress2.com/ LIST
00,02there is a list :3
Thank you Phase4 <3
Now to figure out how I've managed to not find out about these servers until now...
apploosa
I had to use 1 continue with Marisa on Easy Mode. :I
Spell-of-Gaming: Have you beaten 8 yet? I need tips for the bunny and Eirin's Last Spell...
I haven't, unfortunately, Reikim.
I should be free on weekends to finish it, though.
Reikim: I'm still dumbstruck at how godawful Marisa/Reimu are
scary
there it goes :D
first time iv seen this game aswell
Spell-of-Gaming: Oh, Marisa's NOTHING. And Reimu's not too bad if you know the patterns in advance.

I mean
Tab fail, that was supposed to go to AzulaSurge.

DAT FEAR
Grunt

ZAMBIEZ
Musical HELLO
Take the chair. The chair will protect you.

Light the candles
Rainbow_Crash it's to survive

Spell-of-Gaming: EASY MODO? Sorry, meme reference was unavoidable.

04And why do you need my help
madagascar 3 dosent really look good
Phase4 was streaming.. but it seems his pc crashed AlienEd27
04I don't know anything about coding
Greetings everypony.
hai
00,02:<
Hello, EggWhite
Hai EggWhite
4 gigs of RAM, two cores clocking at over 2 GHz, and I still can't play TF2 on anything other than basic settings. Although that might be my connection, to be honest.
00,02power dropped THREE TIMES
00,02:<
04Except basic Python
Wb Phase4 x)
ok, i see, hope he comes back on then Airpuff
:$
OctoReikim: Could be your graphics card
00,02that washing machine has to go
still Drake
/me is ded X_X
00,02keeps tripping the rcd
I could get Sazerac in
Phase4: wanna trade some stuff :P
Very_Silly_Filly: Yeah, probably is.
/me 00,02hugs Vordox
and Nyx is far better than I am at python
=3
I hope to see you play with us now!
You know what I should do Drake
Atleast test it out =3
I should every single task on that competition
My Graphics card is brilliant, it's an ATI Radeon 6400 HD and the computer it's in can't run TF2
00,02if i'm lucky
I should write*
00,02YES
in mIRC script
Becuause of it's crappy 1gb :/
6_9
00,02THEY FIXED THE STREAM BUG
:}D
04LOL
00,02:3
:D
Stream bug?
Wat bug?
00,02you should see a stream now
04doit
Yeah.. xD
Party with pinkie! awesome song ^_^
hell ill play with ya as soon as i fix my damn pc
I do.
I'm tempted to
Very_Silly_Filly: Ram is cheap though, why don't you replace it?
it seems to fit into the requirements for what language you want to use
Streams can get ill?
so presumably it'll work
mwhahaha
Very_Silly_Filly: Want to get together and combine our machines?
00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gfniCDbbzg << i like this version too
00,02little lighter than the original
otherwise I'll use python/C
Phase4: No utube while streaming, damn noob
Well, chances are other than RAM mine probably would be the more dominant
I never knew that stream had a bug O.o
Your computer probably just needed restart?
00,02Vordox, its when you loose a connection
Phase4 is now a hypocrite now :D
Lol Shimmer ...
00,02it would lock server-side and stop me from streaming
:)
Oh...that's kinda derp. Good thing they fixed it then. =3
Very_Silly_Filly: Whoever said that RAM is cheap is completely right. Hell, buy a 2-gig USB stick and hook that up as RAM.
I know that, but I don't have ANY money
A warning, Phase4 , There's plenty of updates on L4D2. So be careful with the download. :P
00,02i'ma start that downloading
So Phase4: when its installed...
00,02Vordox, not a problem, i get free steam downloads :3
Very_Silly_Filly: A USB drive costs what, 10 bucks now?
I'm gonna get my laptop fixed and get a graphics card
<.< Oh..Erm...no idea how but GREAT!
OctoReikim: We only have enough money to live on atm
Getting 16gb for my new pc, that costs me like 150USD I think
Very_Silly_Filly: Ah, okay.
Not sure how to check my graphics card...anyone else now?
Plus RAM chips are retarded for DDr2
*knoe?
*know?
OctoReikim: I do
hello everypony :)

Drunkown, good morning.
00,02Vordox, i know nothing!

TERRARIA SERVER: 85.197.171.168:7777 Pass: bronystate
Yay
drunktown: only 7:30 for me, but good morning regardless
I'm at work :(
Erm Lil_B better show him how to do stuff. D:
I TRUST YOU TO TEACH Phase4 before he meets ANY WRAITHS!
Vordox yes, start a new map with new characters?
00,02any what now?
Lil_B: Hmmm...Might be a good idea. <.<
User0: so sorry :,(
We have unlocked Hard mode on this World
Which means....Everything will one shot you :P
00,02no copy paste aparently
vordox: playing terraria?
who is streaming? ic tf2
ingwaz: Yep, server is up :P
Although it's hard mode
So Lil_B, a new map for now, or try and "gear him up quick"? :P
Phase4 our world is in hardmode, Enemies would one-hit you with a new character, but our characters are way to overpowered for a new map, so we will all start at zero
00,02what the shit
00,02i was slain by a gravestone
oni_link: oh well, but it is casual friday - RD is on my desk and I'm wearing my mlp wristband and belt.

ninja-pony: eeeexxxxxcelent :3
Why is there Lightsaber sounds?
mods
WorldTraveler: I say I say you got issues boy
this looks like minecraft
Someone has a lightsaber in game
Spell-of-Gaming: i have respect for all cereal, this one is just my everything though XD

you won't believe how many mods there are on that server
jappleack: A LOT

http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/132634025570.jpg
it looks like minecraft omg is there like copyright violation or something?
It does not look like minecraft -.-
have you even played it?
wel im going to go to sleep now ladies BYE! everypony sleep well :)
night ninja_pony
gnight ninja_pony
it looks like a 2D version of minecraft from what I'm seeing
WorldTraveler: there are SO many mods, the code is 100% different.
goood night ninja_pony!
rdibp: F*CK YEA
night oni_link and every other pony night! :)
Besides, notch would be the last person to rip on people for copyright claims
listening to this with your eyes closed dosent sound good
The coding is DEFINATELY different. Minecraft is Java while this is pretty much something made out of scratch.
I wish they would released pre-modded versions of mincraft
rdibp: *impure thoughts*
I can never get mods to work on mine
oh and 1.3 is going to be amazing
WorldTraveler: They're trying to implement a Mod API system
WorldTraveler: I heard that there was nostalgia or something which can revert minecraft to older versions...
http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/133909019770.jpg
WorldTraveler: wait, I read that wrong
Phase4: u still streaming?
le classic derp
00,02yeah
they have pyramids, cocoa trees, jungle temples, boats don't crash into lilypads, villager trading, etc.
WorldTraveler: just grab technicpack and keep going
emeralds, TRIP wire, its gonna be great
Phase4 It looks like no more can join :(
00,02:(
You want more player to join?
Give me a mom
but I follow the instructions to install mods and they still don't work
/me gives vordoz a mom
Terraria is an overated game anyways...just like minecraft
WorldTraveler: grab technicpack, done
and a server kicked me out for asking for help. A brony server!
I kinda don't know the hype about Minecraft.
Okay, I'll restart the server
get the technic launcher. does the work of installing the mod for you
The default for a server is 8
I understand liking it but... the damn fandom
IT'S HUGE
hence grab technicpack, done
not yours... I mean a different server. Brohoof
Spell-of-Gaming: Talk about shit for a community
My internet is not crappy for there is others that have the same problem
is there a way to play 4e D&D online?
00,02Vordox, lost connection
Phase4: same
Yeah
He restareded sever silly

Bronysith: Terraria
Terraria
b-but we're your friends lul
hey Deleted_dreams hows your day been
Bronysith: Terraria
Hi Deleted_dreams
lol this is hilarious
Anyway this meme will get old
like all other memes.
MLP isn't a meme.
like all the other trolls?
lul: > implying this is a meme
alexxm: Good :) valoreins: Hey Elondras: Heyy
I'm not a troll i'm a hater
fandoms aren't memes
MLP isn't a meme. It's a way of life.
And oni_link
trollface been goin strong for around 11 years now
its a part of life, not meme
You keep saying implying. Got any else to say you fuckhead?
Yeah, watch yer language mister
lul: Yes. Get out.
lul: No it is buckhead I belive
technically, under the actual definition of a meme, it is indeed a meme.
people will get tired of MLP when people get tired of porn.
MLP has the definition of a meme
But not a meme
in other words, never.
but then our meme is upgraded into lifestyle
but the definition of meme extends far beyond what we consider to be meme
Pinkie pie = a fucking disgrace to the world applejack = a stupid fucking farmer rainbow dash = a flying faggot fluttershy = a bitch and rarity
lul you what a meme is?
Dont even let me get started on rarity
lul: what
lul: For a hater, you sure know a lot about the ponies.
lul: Why are you even here?
I watched one episode
he's a brony
It got boring i fell asleep.
lul: you fail at trolling :)
he knows the characters of the show :D
lul is closet brony
lul is a closet brony! :o
lul: Admit it. You love it. :D
FINE
I LOVE IT
welcome to the herd lul
Yay
Welcome
lul: You have never watched the show tehrefore everything you say is invailded
schweet
ONE OF US
lul: oh... new meat?
lul: :)
one of us
lul: WELCOME
yes becuase you can judge a lot about a show and its characters by falling asleep during the one and only episode you watched...
Welcome welcome welcome, a fine welcome to you! Welcome welcome welcome I say how do you do?!
fishy story was fishy
lul: The power of ponies compels you! :D
Bronysith: Hes bad meat
:D
let's all talk in posh english to confuse him even moer
G'day!
WindWhistler: Capital idea old sport!
so what game is this

BRB EVERYPONY
Elondras: No video links

sorry about that
a being of the mythical world known as a troll, also a term used for immature squablers looking for attention in the place known as the internet

lul: Wait...I need to give you the discord welcome...PAINIS big boom high ho!
Hard to believe it's already been three months since I first came here...

Camp Slaughter was pretty crappy in the beginning

Phase4: hey... WallDives thought th esame thing :D
Phase4: Printing vs. Browsing requirements?
i don't get it Phase4
I make dem mods go bad.
:3
00,02SELECT is an sql keyword
We'll just assume no one but you knows Phase4.
Phase4: Oh! Internet Explorer with MS Word?
Id post a pic on facebook
00,02they are making their sql queries incorrectly
Phase4: uh... what?
but my sister will be here in minutes demanding I give it to her LOL
nowai
Internet explorer? :D
Phase4: internet explorer is the lol in there! :D
00,02you could dump their entire database with SELECT * FROM *
Oh!

Dammit, I forgot about that, Phase4. :I
00,02FlareChaser, XD
Oh.
sqee
Oh!
That would be bad.
:D
never knew...
imma rest my eyes
and theres no chrome.
Phase4: Like I said, only you knew that.
fluttershy squee is best squee
12how did you win it again? =P
why is there no chrome?
yup, IE is for lols
00,02allso thats the password field, so they are storing passwords in plaintext
00,02which is HORRENDOUS
no jappleack!!!!!!!!!!!
/me clicks something, Vinylx
Phase4: Dear god.
Phase4: oh... wow.... well thats a lol to someone who knows that stuff XD

and as an owner of xbox 360 i feel ashamed about that e3 2012
if i dont rest my eyes im gonna fall asleep
valoreins: get a PC.
wait..
FlareChaser: Smash it then, and enjoy typing using your mouse.
valoreins: why that?
why halo 4 is coming
05sooo yeah
00,02as someone who's only working console is a Wii, i care little for E3
i dont have pc, i only have my laptop
Reikim: okay :3
05lets hope skyrim doesnt crash again
Suddenly, Wrek .
00,02lol skyrim
Phase4: Amen.
but youre gonna fall asleep like that
it was a club nintendo offer at the start of the year, to celebrate the soon arrival of kid icarus, register two selected games (I used Resident Evil Revelations and Pokemon Rumble) and dl kid icarus 3D classics free
00,02Wrek, your turn?
Wrek: skyrim is a b** when it comes to crashing -.-
05if this crashes ill rpobably stream tf2
Morrowind is best Elder Scrolls.
ive been using mods for skyrim
Wrek: Should I hope the sun doesn't set while we're hoping for impossible things? :3
Airpuff: brb, gotta brush mah mane :D
00,02just tell me when
Phase4: wii u does not dissapoint
Elondras: dont you see the microsoft conference? its made of fail
:)
panda: :D
00,02oni_link, probably not but i have no money
valoreins: you still doing college stuff? :3
yup
but also you can enter into a prize draw for it if you choose so, and hte more selected games you register the higher your chance of winning so I used the two mentioned along with Mario 3D land, Mario Kart, Starfox pilotiwngs
valoreins i only saw the Halo 4 Gameplay and that one was awesome!
panda: i dont get how you manage to get on, BEFORE work :D
i know that feel phase4
plus there was 3,000 to be won so a good chance really
00,02and now i play my outro
12whoa why did I not know of this LOl
splintercell is looking good too
12I still need to register all the rest of mine XD
thought you did .-.
Smooze.
Goddamnit.
Wrek: So you'll be playing Skyrim?
dead space 3!!!!!!!!!!!
I HATE YOU! I CAN'T HAVE VOLUME!!
12Congrats dood! :D

Elondras: Halo 4 was fine for fps gamer, you don;t wanna see more from that conference
05Phase4: tf2 time :P
Airpuff: waiting for parent to finish mowing the lawn first, lol
TF2 sounds good.
Wrek: what a surprise.
Wrek: it always crashes
00,02k
Also Wrek has the best music, so this works.
Sylandest: 6_9
what is this:D
Elondras: i gave up on COD. i am dissapoint. MW3 was full of fail
Wrek: in fact it crashes so much. the insurance company should be paying you
Airpuff: I take my breaks when I can get them! :D
NOTHING CAN STOP IT!!!
00,02Wrek, streams free
The smooze?

WallDives: howdy again!
Sylandest: ahaha, well thats good :P

Hey WallDives

Elondras: One of the most random videos that we show here.
00,02Meanwhile, 6_9

how far CriticKitten
CriticKitten: Tell me about it.
User0: O_O really? all at work? damn, I have to wear a dress shirt and stuff
and then this happens.
MFW I wonder why the soldier's golf club is floppy.
random broohoof /)
CriticKitten: - you mean apart from the places that don't alow teachers to give a grade below 70%?
even if the correct grade is "0"
FlareChaser|Octavia: And then no one cared. Ever.
hi ecco!
HiImSpike: i miss pc gaming, the orange box is a joke on 360 and its online is dead
lol
panda: I am wearing a nice shirt and khakis, but it is friday so I can justify the belt
!pokemon
Nick, you are a 7Snorunt.
Can't give below a 70? holy crap!
or something like that... might've been 60
Dem boots.
regardless, there were a few districts around the country that basically said you can't give a failing grade
period.
MirrorImage: Where the hell is that happening?
How are you all today?
don't remember - this was a few years ago i believe
happy as you know :)
Bronysith: Get ready, I'm getting Diablo III today :P
FlareChaser|Octavia: im writing in my chapter man
oni_link true have you got your new tower yet
Fu,Diablo 3
Bronysith: yay! new chapter! :D
CriticKitten: And you said...?
60 euro
That's really weird. But on second thought, they literally pass anyone in my school to get them off their backs.
basically
Yes, that's right: a kid with a 48% for his class work and 45% on the final, and the conselor wanted me to swing his grade with last minute work. >_>
I said no.
FlareChaser|Octavia: no. im writing in my book
Because I had already gifted him several HUNDRED points in the past two weeks.
>in shipping with 5 different users on tumblr >feels good man
glad to hear, ^^
00,10What to do with my new found day off.
HiImSpike: nah i gotta save up. i havent been to work like in 3 months cause of a skating accident. dat california lifestyle
Sumica: ponies?
LOL scoot scootalo is doing a livestream reading my little dashy
Sumica!
Sumica: Ponies.
Sumica: You live in Vegas. What do people usually do in Vegas?
i believe there's a mini-marathon on The Hub right now
Sumica, you buy a ps3 and then play a game with me
The only reason he had a 48% was that he received several hundred points in the last week or two that brought his grade up by well over 10%.
or rather, they don't normally show 4 separate episodes in a row like they are like now
>_>
00,10but i am broke due to having to replace car battery erlyer this week.
Sumica: We hold a massive TF2 tournament culminating in a showdown between regulars and mods.
CriticKitten: Those are the kids who don't care until like the last week and then complain about how unfair their teachers are for not handing them a passing grade on a silver platter. They deserve to fail.
that sucks, sumi
People usually spend the whole year not caring.
Wrek is =+PRO+=
Sumica: Gutted. Well, stay inside all day watching tv and eating ice cream.
So I was like "dude, I already gifted him way more than I feel morally correct in gifting him, there's no way I'm going to drive thirty minutes back to school just to grade something ELSE so he can pass".
oni_link what are going to have in it, besides if you have steam you can redownload your games to your new computer hold in their buddy
I have to go now. Class is ending. Bye guys!
bye
Seeya ic-gine.
gone*
valoreins: whatcha doing? :3
byr
00,10Will go in to work later to get payed but yeah. Worked too far ahead the last few days
CriticKitten This kid should be thankfull that you already gave him this point's
bye Icybeauti
To fulfill this hypothetical scenario in which he passes? I'd have to drive thirty minutes to the school, grade whatever assignment I gave him, and then fill out the paperwork to change it. I was like "yeah no."
Alright, time to stalk wrek.
FlareChaser|Octavia: I'M DOING NOTHING! NOTHING SUSPICIOUS AT ALL!
wrek - that was a kritzkrieg, not a medigun...
valoe....that makes me suspicious..
valor*
valoreins: you are now completely suspicious
CriticKitten: Kid deserves to fail. Little bastard.
HiImSpike: yeah i didnt have much on Steam cause i had discs (which i lost) i guess i can get TF2 since its f2p now and i think i had SFIV on steam
He's a nice kid, don't get me wrong, but this is something I had to take a stand on.
One does not simply übercharge with a kritzkrieg.
o.o
valoreins: what are you doooing? :|
Meanwhile: unless you're playing Vs Saxton Hale
/me backs away from the bronystate lounge
Hi everypony!
Eh, I never use kritzkrieg.
CriticKitten: I find teachers these days tend to be way too lenient. Congratulations.
im back
ohai LoGaN
Allo LoGaN.
00,10Kinda want to play some redfacton some more. so I will
FlareChaser: he acts suspiciously...pursue and capture!
Hi LoGaN
hey LoGaN hows your day been
:p
ok i guess
Sumica: Hammer time?
/me grabs valoreins "where are the cupcakes?" :|
I must have cupcakes.
WAT CUPCAKES?!?!
Oh no, don't get the situation wrong. He's a good kid. He's just very lazy because he's decided that he can't do math. Unfortunately, while I like him as a person, I can't justify helping him graduate when he did much less work than the people I *did* save
one does not simply snipe Wrek.
oni_link sorry for your loss man hurts to hear
i'm off for a while i need to check what my gamer clan is doing...
FlareChaser: I've traded headshots with Wrek
If you lower the bar too much, they'll trip over it when they get to the real world.
CriticKitten: Well that's unfortunate. That's always the worst case, isn't it? When the student just gives up.
FlareChaser: so have I.
cya elondras
HiImSpike: I wasnt a hardcore TF2 player but its my motivation to get a new tower now :)
Meanwhile: yeah its pretty easy, except I use the Sydney Sleeper.
Reikim: I *hate* when it happens. It makes me really sad because they're always so close, but they just....stop.
mt lil pwny
CriticKitten: Amen there.
my*
Reikim: They often don't realize how close they were.
Sydney Sleeper, pfft. What a stupid idea for a weapon.
FlareChaser: /)
Genius.
Actually, its helps my team a lot too.
Meanwhile: Machina isn't much better...
I use a classic. I have done for several years.
I only quickscope...
User0: ...no..
00,10indeed hammer time
sidney sleeper is good if you can prioritize right
Meanwhile: Yeah, but most people have to work up to the vanilla rifle.
it's also fun to skeet-shoot rocking jumping soldiers with it
"PULL!" *pfft*
00,10guess I'll set up
05or not sumi
Holy crap
can we all agree that cod4 is best cod? :)
Meanwhile: I had to use the piss-rifle briefly before I figured out the sensitivity of controls, where to hide, and whatnot.
I have no respect for anyone who tries to pass the sydney sleeper off as a weapon that has any place in the game.
00,10oki have fun then wrek
I never knew Android smartphones were that generous
Or anyone who mains it.
so the whip makes you go faster
dat snipe
Meanwhile: i main the Huntsman actually
Meanwhile: it helps your team a lot, I dont see whats wrong with it.
MirrorImage: That's nice?
They're asking to transfer iPad data to your ANDROID smartphone.
but i'm just saying that the Sleeper isn't "bad"
it's just different
A rifle that can't make a headshot isn't a rifle.
Meanwhile: *cough*Huntsman*cough*Degroot*cough*
yes, but a rifle that makes your heavy on the front line go "lolded" even more than he normally does...
insert jarate instead?
TF2 is about teamwork, not headshots and kills.
00,02^
00,02^^
TF2 about hats
00,02if only i could get my brother to understand that
00,02allso dat DaniilScit
kills are good, but it's not what it's explicitly supposed to do
00,02:P
this is also why BF3 and FS are good FPS titles as well
00,10tempted to join
Phase4: Does your brother play CoD? Because that might be the problem.
so much whipping
05each headshot helps the team
Protip, you support the team more by killing the opposing team and the classic is better for that.
TF2 about hats and metal
00,02Reikim, no but he wants to
Exactly.
indeed, and so does Jarate
2.99 ref
about 2.99 ref
You can deck a fully healthed heavy in one good headshot.
00,02dat 2.99
dat riding crop
Hat for 2.99
ref
what excuality does the whip do
Assuming you can aim anyway.
alexxm: Speeds up teammates you hit with it.
got to go everybrony
thanks Meanwhile
Well, I think I might go play TF2 now.
bye HiImSpike
HiImSpike: bye :)
Sumica: go play :3
Brb all

Meanwhile where
Eeeeveeerywheeeeere
alright then
Just remember...Everyone is a spy..

Samsung is one generous company
Prefer the equalizer personally.

i didn't know the solidor was the kinky type

Gonna put this out here now: every team needs more medics. No exceptions.
Idk, I've seen enough people wander into sentry gun fire because of unexpected speed boosts to question it's use.
I make a great medic
^
Reikim: I had a game where we were all medics - it failed pretty badly...
User0: I'm referring mostly to the fact that so many players refuse to play medic.
Spell-of-Gaming: i plan on getting an S3 at the end of the year
Didn't know you played Rain.
Reikim: I know, but I took screenshots of so many medibeams
every now and then
yes
:3
You have steam?
Hey everypony how y'all doing?
User0: The ultimate medic train.

User0 how badly did it fail
Good EggWhite :)
Im joining as soon as my desktop reboots
it wasnt letting steam open :\
hey EggWhite hows your day been

very much so... very badly - people don't understand how to work together as medics
everyone popped, then everyone got mowed down...
My days been good I've been playing Terraria how about you?
User0: That's bad. It's supposed to be pop-Ubersaw the crap out of the team-switch and pop.

i'm good EggWhite is terraria good
but a wall of shimmery blue people was funny...
iLivid plug-in advert, y u no go away

For some reason it doesn't recognise that ad,.

Thanks. <3
im listening to flutterwonder
anypony?
so whats the worst game you guys have played
hmm...
idk
did everyone die
Hrm.
READY THE PARTY CANNONS!
alexxm: recently? I'd say Vanquish or Bulletstorm
FI-YAAAAAAAAAH!!!
Right now, the only two games that come to mind are Rise of the Robots and Pitfighter
AzulaSurge how bad are they
bulletstorm is fun
Kandarihu never heard of the robot one how bad is it
gg
I'm not sure I've every played any truly bad games.
Oh, wait.
Lair.
Honestly, I loved Lair, but it had so many flaws I had to force myself to finish it.
LoGaN: it's a modern FPS with fun weapons that you can't use properly because the enemies never collaborate :D
that the dragon one that was supposed to demo the sixaxxis controller Leadhoof
Leadhoof: the graphics are better than normal for the SNES and there's this nice SPC guitar riff in the beginning, and that's al that's good about it.
valoreins: you...are...going..TO FINISH ME!
Yup, alex. That's the one.
Well, that was fun. Can't play while eating though.
It's a fighting game where the main character doesn't, to my knowledge, have any special moves.
FlareChaser: that sounds kinky...
valoreins: ....you shall...finish...my DRAWING!
is this pitfighter or rise of the robots Kandarihu
oh lol
RotR
ah right thanks
wait 1 more week until i finish my finals
LOVE ME!!! :[
/me hugs Randomnerd
hey thats mine!
So yes, there is ONE protagonist who fights different robots during the story mode.
I wanted it to be great. Freakin' love games like that, but that sixaxis was just...ugh. So unresponsive and hardly ever did what you wanted it to. Honestly, motion controls don't belong in certain genres on gaming.
/me hugs alexxm back.
wont let me talk
02LOL
And the Vs mode is just a reinactment of the story mode battles with p2 controlling the bad guy. So Player one can only choose the hero to play as.
there we go
Leadhoof i thought the heavenly sword bit with the arrows was a good demostration of sixaxxis
02drf is in the very middle of everyone
You know what? I didn't really hate playing Pitfighter after all.
(\
Let's see...oh, right. Mission objectives were thrown at you left and right and many times you could fail if you didn't figure out which one you had to jump on ASAP, which, again, would be a problem when the sixaxis didn't do what you wanted.
11,02Cupcakes ^-^

So sweet and tasty
Oh, this music. It's too awesome

Congratulations, SuperBrony64|AFK
lucky SuperBrony64|AFK
There was a little stylized arrow at the top of the screen that pointed you in the direction of your objectives. Sort of. It was angled in such a way that you couldn't tell if it was poiting in front of you or behind you.
SuperBrony64|AFK: Your so lucky, SuperLucky64.:D
11,02i liek lucky :3c
hi TheRainbowDash|Busy
Good points of Lair: Loved the scenery and the story, and the music is brilliant. I bought the soundtrack on iTunes.

Has anypony played the new Twisted Nipples game for PS3? : D

<3
MASF123 what is that an actully thing
No picture at the top and no paintchat. It was literally stream and chat when I joined Bronystate

hello everypony! )
even the editor is awesome looking
:)
I felt almost the same way when my friend literally survived death by a thread
he was unhappy though. :/
I thot of suicide once..... but that very day, i met a friend, and the last thing he said (as a joke) before he left school that day was "Oh yeah, and dont die, thats bad"... snapped me back into my senses
CAN NOT GET STUPID SCREW OUT OF IPOD
This is light years ahead of Unreal Engine 3
13so terrible...
(though that's a good thing obviously)
He is very very lucky to be alive, and even sane
er
Very_Silly_Filly: What happened?
lol unreal engine 4
i'vebeen in his situation before
He had a car accident and was hit by some debris
time to spend 2000$ on another PC to get it to run at 1FPS?
i'm not gay though, so yeah
a riding crop
Completely mashed his eye and it also hit his brain
Wrek here arent anyponies there
Pony_9001: Remember, if you're going through tough times, you can always count on us to have your back. No-one should loose his/her friend. Especially if he/she is close to you.
He was on life support for about 2 weeks, to awake like a cabbage.
<3
Nothing wrong with being gay..... but it took me SO LONG to figure that out.... Im so ashamed of my past self....
i'm straight
i have no problem with gays
I thot that since im straight, i was superior...
:'(
RaveBrony: Im bi
We payed so much money to get surgery on his brain, and he's about 60% fine now

Hi kirzstryfe
anyone remember steam summer sales last year?
Yep
those were AMAZING
I joined steam in 2004 :)
2011. :B
When it was first avalible, my dad bought Half life 2 and it said on the box
"Works on steam!"
time to try tf2 :)
Very_Silly_Filly steam was around back then?
Steam was released the same time HL2 was
steams been around for a long time
That's 2004
that's a long time.
damn its older than i thought it was
I've been a member of Steam since it's first week :)
my favorite steam game is l4d2.
I got steam with the orange box
the size for max payne 3
30 gb's, oh my god
13only a kdr of 0.1 so far
Bloody hell
Erectin' a wingboner
Shizuka: Wow,
Then again, TF2 is not like CoD
the only reason i play mw2 for pc is because of 4D1. <3
FPS games are meh
13it's only horrifyingly terrible
they're already, but they get boring
*alright
TPA is good
/me dat sniff
In Counter strike, if you get a KDR of 10.0 or higher, you're pretty much instantly called a hacker
^this
You seriouslly have to be poopsock quality to get that :3
i did good with a tmp in counter-strike and i got banned for hacking
/me wonders if there are any spots on the brony server open yet...
13yes
Shizuka: man tf2 is fun right?
13shamrocs picking on a girl when she's down
/me wonders if somepony would show him where the brony server is
think i'm getting sick, nose is runny. :'(
13finally a mode i'll be remotely useful at
Sounds like somepony has a spot of the sniffles
Is this payload, I don't understand German
Wait, what
Herp. I meant Swedish
Shizuka - point me to the server?

Kandarihu is it good
You can do amazing amounts of damage, but can take very little damage.
but its not bleeding
dat MIDI
:O DOOM <3
....
And team damage is always on... so you end up killing each other as much as the enemy.
anyone know the bible game that used wolfensteins source code
And they say this causes kids to be violent ;)
ikr?
^^
alexxm: Super Noah's Ark 3D

Kandahiru: but that's the fun part of coop :D screwing your team over
So it's not really Co-op. I've heard it described as Troll-op.

Kids=Violet
ded
god so many games I want such as MGS3D and KIU
So, shit. i cant reallu game
10BlueFlare
I troll-op everyday in l4d2

.
Kandahiru: as long as it's in good fun it's the best troll-op ever
hello DerpStar.
I micspam Fanfics FOR TEH LULZ
Oh Hai WallDives
what consoles do u currently have?
why was this contoversual again
hey WallDives hows your day been
Butthurt Soccer Moms The End
alexxm, alright.
Dances_With_Discord, more like mute user the end.
alexxm: violence and the possibility to turn your enemies into gibs
gibs?
thanks AzulaSurge and Dances_With_Discord
current: 360, Wii, DSi, 3DS
w0w
*Shrugs*
AzulaSurge: L4D has the limited function of helping fallen team mates up before they die. Magicka gives you a spell to ressurect dead team mates just so that death is cheap.
but there's actually games I want for the PS3 mainly the new Sly Cooper and the smash bros style game
*Is pretty hyper*
DOOM!!!!! :)
No Wrek, use rockets/machinegun/plasmagun against revenants! :D
*hugs Wrek* I'm know that feel bro :(
but yeah I'd also like GoW3, MGS4, Killzone 2&3 and try the uncharted games certainly but if all those goes to vita then I'd prefer that
HERP
DERP
herpaderp
but PS3 has better download titles such as the PsOne and PS2 classics, but then again I want the original PS3 for its backwards compatability since i have a tonne of PS2 games still
my PS2 died :(
Right now, the game alone is $2.49. The game with all the DLC is $6.24. Next week, the next major DLC is coming out and will retail for a normal price of $4
AzulaSurge: oh :D
ask drf
I've played this mod, it's hard
Twilight pls!
back
:P
he might have an original PS3 for sale
speaking of butthurt soccer...
Dat Cold
