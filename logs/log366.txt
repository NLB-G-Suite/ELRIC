interesting science fact, regular lightbulbs operate at only 8% efficiency, the rest of the energy you're using generates heat and is wasted
[SWAG]Haku: that's Mirror's Edge
Nom its FreddieW
*No
True
catmario anyone ?

Ingwaz: actually only 1/25 of a bulb is light, the rest is heat yes.

I remember the original release of Chrono Trigger on the SNES, and I wanted to buy it. But it was too expensive at the time, 60 bucks for a brand new game IIRC

MARIOOO
I remember constantly renting SMB3 from the store.
Dat Genesis! Leader of the 16 bit revolution!
:'( i never had a snes
/me hugs back.
otakon: one time I saw a place selling a nes for 5 DOLLARS. but my father wouldn't let me buy it because "I have too many consoles"
good ol' NES for me
It was forever before I owned SMB3 myself
pissed me off so bad
had 2 nes
I had both..but then both broke :(
emangamer: that SUCKS! I would have JUMPED at that chance!
Super Mario World was the best, and Yoshi's Island 2 was a good game
Lul, that goomba.
.... i cant keep anyones attention long enough... maybe i should forget trying to do the livestream... obviously a false hope...
otakon: oh and it came with SMB
jus wanted to bring more entertainment to bronies here.... guess they're good..

TOY_PON3: that game is awesome
10,02Not on my Wii, but on the N64, yes.
Nice
well, all the smash bros. games are awesome :P
I hate LimeV ;A;
I have it on Wii
04The Banshee is cooler
00,10what's wrong Simon?
F-Zero on the Wii U (please change the name) needs to happen
Always Server not found
04And I have a feeling my use of the term 'Banshee' is going to cause confusion in this conversation
like Phase4
00,10odd
ohai Simon
hi Phase4
OMG DONT SAY
8D
dammit!
but the princess is in another castle
Really Toad?!
lol
Haha
Sumica: http://pastebin.com/digK7vDG << dead router
If it doesnt get lasered off spawn than the defenders are beyond retarded.
hehe
Silver world?
I'm suprised mario just didnt give up ._.
Toads need a troll face
Hasbro would have made the trees white

:S Epic Fail Much?
the router at 206.130.126.61 is dead and its blocking access to limev from some places in the world
PLOT HOLE: Mario can't swim?

1,3water hazard, -1 stroke
00,10I asume your saying you are unable to conect cause of that
Sumica: isnt it :3
Sumica: yeah
MahBoi777: You're damn right I'm mad!
04NS I doubt we'll be able to have 2 aircraft when we're basically fugitives
:|
LOL

That reminds me of an image of Toad I saw a while back
how can you guys quote tht fa+

04And Zealot, how many phases are there in that map?
00,10so it's an isp issues or is it teremnating insides limev's network?

*BROs

Sumica: its betwene limev and me
That never changes.

Sumica: Simon is going along about the same path
hi
206.130.126.61 belongs to 'westhost.net' so lets blame them
I know dat feel
1,3hey
*feels ignored*
00,10sounds like US Backbone issue
THEN MY RETARDED TEAMATE TOOK IT AND LOST IT.
ohai AttackWithHugs

I got to 216.256.0.6
I know a game they should play on the net...
Sumica: yeah
/me attacks AttackWithHugs with hugs
Rainbow Dash Attack.
denide
AttackWithHugs: Didn't see you there
lol
ohai MahBoi777. I was talking about the idea of a Brony Award Show
00,10sadly we have no one on to swap embed to mips
Hay, that star just commited suicided.
hi MahBoi777
10,02Red_Pegasus: LOL
MahBoi777: I didn't see you there
Simon: um, thats an invalid ip
400
That level was hard as hell
one of the plumbers said "I'm like, freaking out man." Then he ate my wife's prized petunes and spouted some drug fuled delusions about spitting fireballs.
How can I copy the texts in cmd.exe?
mario should stop stealing goods
hai Simon
04XD
:D
why cant all the mods swap enbeds
he ate some magic mushrooms too
The star didn't commit suicide it just fell to terraria
man, he was big
04You call everyone who isn't at your skill level retarded and/or a noob
TOY_PON3: I like to sneak in when noone's looking, lol
Simon: right click and click select, then select text and right click again to copy
NOO
DENIDE
/me drink tea
MahBoi777: That sounds wrong :D
me *drinks
win
04NS just leave Rhy with the Skyscraper. 3 people can't run and maintain 2 aircraft and a whole host of weaponry at once.
I was doing well, then he takes it off the elevated spawn.
AttackWithHugs: awards show you say?
would never win award
TOY_PON3: don't make it sound wierd :D
only 1 life left? If this was 3D Land, you'd have 90 lives
Yeah. My boyfriend and I were watching some of setzertrancer's PMVs and the idea just popped in my head.
And you'd have a super mushroom so you couldn't die
.....
10,02My stream derped for a minute there ;A;
i wonder what will toad say
You know what I think of this game? Smashinh.
PFFT
Your princess is here
GAME OVER????????
:D
I got a good mix that match though, skilled people and idiots. Typical MM setting.
Fireballs? yum
a faq did just happend?6_9
Think about it: we have awesome musicians, artists, and meetups. Why not an awards show?
Like I said...Superbrony64, you should play Rainbow Dash Attack.
Back to world 1
04Speaking of spawns, I like how you can put weapos on a 'fixed' physics setting to make them stay still, but when you drop them again they just float in mid-air >.>
rage quit
ha no fuck that
SuperBrony64: SUUURRE...thats why you died alright ;)
SB is now in World -1
http://pastebin.com/ANu8ayjw

It would have to be a livestream though.

EEYYYEESSS
Drake
Everyone must experience its awesomeness.

A dick?

I like how Spartan Skirmish has elite weapons
but in the sequel
YES
GabeMoist: I KNEW IT!
when we possibly go back to stop the war
LOL

Thank goodness. Skyward Sword is the worst game of all time, according to the internet.
dat little troll
I've never played a Zelda game...'_' *waits for the ambush of hate and disbelief*
but Skyscraper survives
Atleast it dosent have Navi.
Hey

Tovler: I will kill you using nothing but my pure consetrated hatred
hey
AttackWithHugs: hate

I meant that I wanted to see skyward sword
Superbrony64: Look up Rainbow Dash Attack...and play it. Its awesome.
/me attacks AttacksWithHugs with attacky hugs
YES!

O_O
NRUUUUUUUUUU

04Listen to what I'm trying to say
woooo coool!
I am
04I know they both die
<3<3
04But after we're on the run
Max.
04and we're alone
Well duh
Simon: http://pastebin.com/d7ZXruie funny thing is when i try to get to my broken one i make it to your broken one
043 people can't maintain 2 aircraft

AttackWithHugs: I only played Twilight Princes9:P
So my browser finally decides to open the chat frame up again after 5.5 hours
when we actually get another helicopter
lol Phase4
Wiered. I can't reach hosted-by.zenex5ive.com [50.115.119.10] but i can see the stream.

04But we're not talking abotu sequels now
er
model names
owlicious: traceroute, you'll stop right before it
I know
/me glomps The_4th_Wall, but not hard enough to break it
it ignores ping packets
we need to come up with model names
I didn't grow up with Zelda.
Ohai Flaria
since this is the future
I remember this, in one of the season you have to fight Santa.
/me waves
this is everything 80's
hey Flaria
10,02Hai Flaria :D
can't use the same ones we have now
MahBoi77: I've never played ANY of them. Mainly because I had my Playstation for a while then got a Playstation 2 and now the Wii is home with my brother.
I may replace twin grav lifts with a vehicle grav lift. I made an Invasion Slayer version (Based off Fallout New Vegas) and it works well.
ohai Flaria
ohai The_4th_Wall, how iz u?
04Easy
AttackWithHugs! havent seen you in a while
Hello Flaria,how are you?
04Boeing AH-98 Apache

/me hugs AttackWithHugs
04Just change the numbers lol
Sorry about earlier that was rude
Phase4: Lol my hard drive stopped working around near-December and I had to use a liveusb of Linux and add school...
Reminds me of Deadmau5's headwear
hugs are a weapon
04You realise that the producers are gonna stay the same right?
can't we make new ones?
04Like Boeing, Grunman etc.
Also: Fallout NV Hoover Dam Invasion map.
/me hugs MahBoi777 and asks, "What's for dinner?"
maybe
is it just me or does the newest wooden toaster song remind anyone else of hot for teacher?
AttackWithHugs: dead hdd's are the worst :(
TOY_PON3: it's hokay. I'm a forgiving person.
I'm back, so pretty good, MahBoi777
yay~
sam & max <3
/me is hugged, and while gasping for air yells PIZZA MAH BOI!
Thoughts, Drake?
You need cheese.
:D
Pizza you say?

Phase4: I know, and seeing as I'm in my 6th quarter of school and I have 2 more left, and Dreamweaver is one of those classes, as well as Capstone. I NEED my computer.
SKittles
/me likes pizza
eez what's for dinner
SuperBrony64: do you have the homestarrunner game for the wii?
note to self, small doses of alcohol make me sleepy
Simon: 216.156.0.6 is perfect for me but the next hop (the 206.something) is dead for both of us
Ill take 100.
so, i think i'm going to go to sleep now everypony, night night
/me may be the first person to possibly have a cheese fetish

Yes I do.
NO ONE TAKES THE WARTHOG INSIDE

Aircrafter: I bought my friend a robot unicorn attack shirt once
/me begins watching Party of One
BEST EPISODE
The_4th_Wall: oh, you mean the best episode so far?
I changed it Drake
i love that episode
Aetherwing
which one?
1,3sleepy time for me everypony, have a good night and see you all later :)
Is it a stealth jet Drake?
Party of One
i was just DCd so i didnt see it
though Rhy could easily equip it with stealth stuff
Psychotic Party Pony Pwns Perfectly
night kirzstryfe
and yea thats a good one
gnight kirzstryfe
Epic alliteration
Hum....
Mods are asleep, post ponies
:)
along with col. Jackson down the mighty missisip
LOL
:D
:O
04I figured it'd be multi-purpose
TOY_PON3: GOOD IDEA
I just opened a conversation with MYSELF.
04Like, she'd outfit it with different specs depending on the mission briefing
Well
in the name?
it is a stealth craft by default?
lol Aircrafter
04Stealth Interceptor, yes
it makes you feel important i know
i did that b4
@_@
whats he have to say Aircrafter
okay wealth
well*
He said...He loves me
and will always be with me
HEHEHEH
04Originally designed as an all-purpose air-to-air and air-to-ground stealth craft
HEHEHE 8D
o.o
night kirzstryfe
I got a funneh video http://youtu.be/QerOwpd3WBc
-pinky pie crazy eyes-
Theta-class Ghost Aetherwing Intercepter X9450
I wanna help pick eps on the Hub
Legend of Zelda invasion
or Theta-class Aetherwing Stealth Intercepter X9450
04lacks air-to-naval capabilities
omg must do
04Second one, NS
i see a happy couple Aircrafter
04Adding 'Ghost' there seems unneeded
DVR= Tardis
actually
I wish HUB would stop showing MLP so fucking early...
probably shouldn't be a stealth inceptor
ikr?
Inorite
Intercepter*
or*
because stealth craft aren't designed particularly for speed etc.
I can't get up dat early, lol
I do not have the time at 6 in the morn too watch....MLP....
04Alright then
We bronies need sleep!
I just realized I have hub too @_@
their design is different
but then id have yo stay up later
04But then, think
I imagine Rhy will add stealth capabilities
i need no such thing TOY_PON3
04It should still have SOME stealth capabilities
Rhy will add them
and by default all craft have some form of stealth capability
04Like hiding heat emissions, IR detection avoidance etc.
Dear Hub: 5:00 evening, Bronies AND children are at home
though stealth craft are better designed
Exactly
stream may be dead, but chat lives on, lol
yes it does MahBoi777
Actually, most stealth aircraft move pretty fast. Assuming you aim for realistic.
Dear HUB: Show nothing else but MLP FiM and Dan vs.
Increase your viewership by OVER 9000
HAHA
I end up sleeping past ponies. The reason I was able to see some of season 2 early was because I had school those Saturday mornings.
Do it HUB!
:|
and We actually make the showings
In Stream, Mortal, In Chat, Eternal, In Silence, LOL CHATS DEAD 8D
Blackbird is an example.
EVERYPONY WINS
i love dan vs
04Could blackbird engage in frantic dogfights?
Depends.
04We're going for as realistic as possible while still maintaining drama/action
plus, I'll buy the lesser demanded figures
well Rhy will add in vent/grills later
lol
HUBDan rocks
well
I might as well record them, until my parents see that I am am and are disappoint.
stealth aircraft can't match other aircraft in dogfights
Aircrafter: Don't be ashamed
I suppose a blackbird could have weapons.
Yeah that.
As in this afternoon, this afternoon?
YA! TOY_PON3! I'M A TRUE BRONY! I CAN DO IT!
^
....Eh....Maybe later though....
speakin of Dan and MLP...http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz6x82Ryv41r8uiq6o1_500.jpg
04I can't imagine a blackbird doing the kind of stunts I'm imagining.
04Dunno why
Eh...I'll give it some time...
Pinkie O U
lol
https://twitter.com/#!/IdidNOTjstsatht/status/168549746502406144/photo/1
I doubt stealth aircraft would be able to engage in dogfights with other aircraft
Blackbirds can, just dont have firepower.
LOL
i love that tumbr
That's me
In BRAND NEW SHIRT
Omg I want that shirt o_o
Cool
Got it at FYE
...... <_<
dat shirt
Eh...Maybe I should just wait a bit though...
Banshees are stealth but can destroy anything that approaches them.
shit I haven't been to FYE in forever
made by Mighty Fine, so available on welovefine.com
dat advertising
The_4th_Wall is best salesman
lol
When my tax money comes in, I'm getting a shirt from MightyFine.
04It also happens to look butt ugly
I want a Derpy shirt
I put it back in bag after taking the pic so no fur
04It is also ancient
Still stealthy and has massive nuclear firepower.
DAMN PETS
me 2
04>Nuclear
04Big no
Ancient wat.
Oppurtunity
I missed the time when everybody went Crazy when it was official that it would be...Derpy...Hooves.
/me will buy out welovefine
Dat Derpy Hooves
and thanks, MahBoi777
I need 100 Derpy shirts!, lawl
Aircrafter: I missed out when Rainbow Dash said Derpy.
/me has bought stuff from welovefine
Sir, it is in 2552. Its not really ancient.
Now I'm angry...Because I have a friend that was in the Pinkie Pie chat room when it happened.
Does it work?
Attackwithhugs: Ya, thats what I meant.
>2552
AttackWithHugs: U must see it!
04oh you're
Nculear fuel rod bursts, equal to balistic missle.
disclaimer is stupid
04oh

04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_F2H_Banshee
I should've been in the Pinkie Pie chat room when it appeared..
04That's what I thought
Aircrafter, MahBoi777: I saw the video on Youtube. I lol'd.
Same here
those reactions
Same.
anyway Drake
LOL
I read the whole thing, it almost makes it so God can't win them in court
I just slammed my head into a wall.
Do we have laser weaponry?
I'm looking too convert my friends too Ponyism.
for aircraft
it was like ...
All you hear is is Derpy, OH SHIT appears in the chat and it just blows up
04Limited laser weaponry
then SPAM
IDEAAAAA
I always go ONEEEEE OFFFF USSSSS.....
hmm... i come back and no stream, mods must be asleep... POST PONIES!
OH SHIT DERPY!!!!
but main weapon on aircraft?
sorry bout all caps
What exactly are you doing?
>.>

Midnight_Tempest: they is, and hi

Canon cannon sinks all fanon ships.
04NS, no, not a main weapon
Ah.
Anybody uh...See...Cupcakes?
cut backs off them
yo Placebo, lol
Aircrafter: MisterDavie?
sew together
ohai MahBoi777
Lasers on aircarft. Not realistic tbh.
Where Pinkie Pie...
Midnight_Tempest: I said that already :P
04My guess is that it would be something Rhy grabs sometime after Delta Commando dies
....Too..Rainbow dash....
LOOK GOOD COMING AND GOING
hiii Placebo
and then...
04This happens in 2069 Zealot
T_T OH GOD.....
TOY_PON3: Ohai. How ya doin?
04Plus I'm not imaginging Star-Wars esque lasers
/me is genius
04imagining*
Placebo: Sleepy and you?
Aircrafter: Fitting song was fitting
genius man!
Still too early. Effective combat lasers would be to bulky for any use.
its stilled burned into my mind.
04More like quick beams to target fuel tanks, stabilisers etc.
TOY_PON3: Haven't done a damn thing all day. So.. great.
04Think the focus rifle
Same here lmao
hey... Aircrafter, we dont talk about... THAT... fanfic here
Forced my roommate to watch the first episode of MLP.
Sorry...
I suppose by then magnetic electric attacks would be available?
SOON, he will join us.
I just joined today...Still alarmed.
How u gonna make it that small, Willis?
And then Celestia was socks.
SOON
Placebo you know what i did from 9AM to 9PM... i was asleep!
I saw the thing today too.
i slept all day
Aircrafter: You a newbie?
CUPCAKES SWEET APPLE
Aircrafter: it's k
oh
okay
04Conceptualising
fillyfillyy: Haha. well rested?
pretend I didn't say anything
/me hands Placebo a 6-pack of sarsparilla
and maybe
I havent been a brony for long either
i was running on 28 hours of no sleep
04NS
atm laser weapons are like
04Give the plane a rail/coilgun
/me runs
Good job
Ouch. So, roughly caught up? lol
I know right?
For the first few days I couldnt get enough of it :P
the size of 3 trucks
what happened was
has been brony since July
Anti-material plane.
I became a brony right after season 1 ended
don't think they'll have downsized to usable aircraft weaponry by then
^^^^
I'm new on Bronystate, but a Brony of half a year
i decided i had the energy to be able to lay on my bed for half a second and then i passed out
Midnight_Tempest: Truer words have never been spoken.
04my railgun idea or the lasers?
.50 rounds on a plane in 2069 sounds right.
Fallout...and Equestria!? MY Two favorite things!?
Mee
too
Placebo: /)
Noooooooooo -head splosion-
@toy
TOY_PON3 i became a brony right when the day after The Last Roundup came out
Aircrafter: Don't start it unless you have enough free time. At over 600,000 words, Your looking at about 50 hours of reading time
what?
Midnight_Tempest: (\
Bro converted me
Oh I have plenty of time.
=w=
I converted myself
Then I highly recommend it.
04well
04NS
Aircrafter: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/04/story-fallout-equestria.html
my friend converted me
fillyfillyy: That's really late
04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_Laser
MahBoi777 sneaked ponies into my youtube, and converted me >_>
i know
LOL
I became a brony through the music.
XD Already googled it.
Aircrafter: the fix is bloody brilliant, and emotionally charged... a definate must read for any Fallout fan
04Not saying it's possible
04But give it some consideration
A more realistic weapon would be nuclear missles.
I heard who created it... watched willingly :P
3Night all you ponies! :3
fic*
SlurryMoon: sleep tight.
Night SlurryMoon
In 10 Seconds flat
Night, SlurryMoon

04considering they'd be way better funded
Hmmm...

04No I'm not suggesting they be weapons used by regular aircraft
Rhy has to have some secondary weaponry too
I sense a disturbance

XD
04No
Mooodddssss!!! :'(
04Kinetic weapons
Search Michael Cox to find my twitter
So right Midnight_Tempest So Right.
derp
what about aircraft weaponry?
04I don't want fucking lasers as assault rifles
:)
Plasma too.
04No plasma
04No lasers
plasma's gay
Michael Cox= Facebook
well
04We're using fucking bullets
I have a addiction too old tv shows.
First I love lucy, now Twilight zone.
04Just so when Nathan shoots a .50 cal bullet at someone's head it explodes
Rhy needs tertiary weaponry too
both awesome show
well
s
wreky come back to me dari
Plasma is more effective than lasers. Think shooting mini-stars at your enemy.
Definetly.
I'm being stalked by a golden retriever
04But we don't want to shoot mini-stars at our enemies.
BUT ITS FUN.
04We want to shoot hunks of lead
Madam la flour
we'll go 2076
hehehe
no your not... that just me O___O
04THEN GO PLAY HALO YOU SCI-FAG
Wait...Did you get a good look at it The_4th_Wall....
04loljokes I play Halo too
because if we go too high we'll start getting laser weaponry
It could just be...FLUTTERSHY DUN DUN DUN!
Mods...where are you?
NOU. ACCEPT CHANGE.
Someones should stream Kablam!
http://youtu.be/bdZ1va0AQYc in case noone has seen this yet
and Drake
Rhy needs a tertiary weapon
MahBoi777: just to make sure right
the mods are sleeping cause some have probably been awake for more than a day... just to watch the mare-a-thon

AttackWithHugs: I haven't seen that show in forever!

I faved immediately
04Railgun
AttackWithHugs: Indeed

I think fallout aircraft has lasers. I'll check.
/me gets an example
Phase4: yup, just makin sure, lol
I missed the mare-a-thon ;.;
MahBoi77, TOY_PON3: Favorite skit was Prometheus and Bob.
Placebo: Me too! :'(

BronyKing: Thanks I needed that

Well Drake

It has gatling lasers
04That's
04stupid
first time
I imagine they'll have to take time to recharge
04in the extreme
Party Hard
Tubs Gusta!
04NS it'd be used as a high-powered artillery shell
04like
otherwise it's overpowered
04OHKO
man does seth love toys
Well
MOD!!!
04You can't rapid-fire a railgun
nah, it's a bot
Yeah I know
but OHKO
PANIC!
Now too listen too some smooth Jazz.
nope, just chuck testa
04Basically
04Rhy comes swooping down
Rhy could just fire 5 times in a dogfight
lol
and win it
04fires the railgun
Unless they get back up.
Party hard, huh?
04and blows up a wall
TOY_PON3 wins
Here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SboSv6diNOw
Who likes Spahs?

04The railgun would be hard to use against a plane NS
I always win thank you very much
party soft
14-minutes of seizure
04It basically fires in a straight line
Its precision, not spread.
Yeah, Drake, that's not hard
Thanks now I need pills
how fast is it?
Pillz here!
04Very.
mfw I realize how many ships i've read lately.
>_>;
04The bullet is like, instantaneous.
OH GOD. THIS SONG
exactly, so it wouldn't be hard to hit a plane
Honeslty, gatling laser would make it seem more realistic/fair.
04Gatling laser
Best numa
04You are fucking kidding me
mfw I realize how many clopfics I haven't read yet
:P

/me pumps arms

Dear god!
Download Double rainbow syndrome VIDEO
Takes chrge up time bro
pinkie doing cocaine....
04There is nothing realistic about a gatling laser
Mediafire: http://www.mediafire.com/?q7ow3idz75agju7
I thought I had forgotten about it....No...
04Because in real life
04lasers don't act like star wars
nah, dat's sugar
LOL

Drake
They also have regular lasers. As in pistol.
04No lasers
I say the railgun takes time to charge on Rhy's aircraft
04NS of course
TOY_PON3: LOL

and a couple of missiles
-puts on sunglasses- Cause I'm a Boss.
is that so Aircrafter : o?
i'm done trying to understand what you bakas are saying
;o;
04I don't think you'd need more than two guns
HEHEHEH
Aircrafter: O RLY?
04Two on the body, right next to the wings
/me explodes, like a BAAAAWWWSSS
04or on the nose
Well...I do have a cat that flies through space with rainbow dash fusing their rainbows MAKING A DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL ACROSS THE SKY.
Aircrafter: I've gotta ask, what's the inspiration for the name?
WOWOOOOW
yeah, but in the air Rhy needs firepower anyway
04either way, the barrels would be hidden inside the hull to aid with aerodynamis
Aircrafter? Well I dont know. Just came up with it one day ._.
04aerodynamics*
same here
04Maybe
044 cannons then
Got'cha.
@_@

04Guns don't go on the tips of wings.
2 double-barrelled rotating/gatling guns
flight sims are best games... space sims are best of flight sims
No I dont....
04Not on planes
I play Ace Combat day in, day out
@_@
http://youtu.be/lHr5mi9graw LMAO
jet
04Yes
04They don't go on the wings
well they're attached
like X-wings in Star Wars
Ace Combat 4, 5, 6 and Zero are best Ace Combats
04NS
Egoraptor. xD
Lol MLP screamo
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyIy_5Fl_pY&feature=related
04You physically cannot put a gatling gun on the tip of a jet's wings
/me has 4,5,6 but hasn't beaten them yet =w=.....
Derpy.
Have AH?
ME GUSTA http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu2Bv8Y_pCs&feature=related
the gatling ones are attached to the main body/hull
you can if you try!
I'm on Assult Horizon ALL the time
no, i havent had the chance to buy it and no TV to play it on atm
TOY_PON3.... You have nice taste.....
I know right?
TOY_PON3 oh myyyyyyy
/me has 6 & ah
but 2 separate cannons are on the wingtips
04Why

TOY_PON3 Well, we know who the Moony Maiden is now
none on the wingtips
04No, NS
04Explain to me
04Why
Eeeyup
i love the soundtracks to the Ace Combat games... especially 4, 5, 6 and Zero :D
Roxsnow: GT?
it's for ships that have a different size/shape
so if they're both firing at each other
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UB9ELCC-kM&feature=bf_next&list=LL_NHpcOwW6HoNa7XqEaDn4w&lf=mh_lolz

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if4RJd7UF30&feature=bf_next&list=LL_NHpcOwW6HoNa7XqEaDn4w&lf=mh_lolz appropriat

/me is sad now
oh lol TOY_PON3
from watching\
/me sold his soul to Namco
i dont even use my XBox anymore... im a PS3 guy
04The wings are too thin for a gun to be on them in the first place.
lol, I know the guy that made that fillyfillyy
04You can attach missiles on the wings because all they need is to be attached and detached
http://www.thetoyshop.com/media/toyshop/products/Hasbro/StarWars/Zoom/346874_obi.jpg
lulz ps3

Perfect plan?
But I was imagining guns like that
except
Needs moar bullets.

/me is not sure to feel scared or wtf
rotating guns are fun
Night, all

hey Sumica, what is the magic word?
04Missiles, 6 machine guns
04a RAILGUN
Cupcakes?
no one looks in the SECRET refridgerator
00,10blatherskype
railgun needs time to reset its position
04Not to mention the TYPES of missiles she has
well
darkwing duck ref
and duck tales
I don't think she can have more than 4 missiles
04And the railgun does not rotate
00,10Ducktales actaly
of course not you fucktard
why would THAT rotate
^
04Then why do you say "reset its position"?
00,10did they have gismoduck in darkwing?
because
it fires
yes
yup
00,10dem hips
Plants vs Zombies on steam for 1.99..
You can rewrite history...
Yes please.
and as to not overpower it
just saying it needs to reset the mechanics
How is Plants vs Zombies?
almost like recharging
then load the next bullet
Discord!
GismoDuck made a few appearances on Darkwing
SuperBrony64 played it one time, it looked fun
: 3
04ok
04fine
Cool
04Honestly I'm starting to think it doesn't need a railgun
04In what conceivable way could Rhy put a railgun on a jet
:O
dang it... can't stop staring at miss fanservice.....
epic pie time!
04She's not that smart
Discord is best troll
orly
@_@
04and nor is anyone in the company

A HAT!
Thats a Nice Hat.
Oh pastries, pastries
that IS a nice hat
Adam West, actor
Thats a nice pie.
holy crap, I found out Valve released a free mod in Skyrim in which you can have Space Core in the game :o
And Drake
SPACE WA WA WHAT!?
/me can't stop staring at miss fanservice....
aren't all mods free?
railgun requires "recharging" so she can't constantly use it
lol its dick
TOY_PON3: you serious? that's awesome!
04We established that
I know
04multiple times
well Valve specifically released it
Dicky boy XD
they didnt bake the pie
04Goddamnit this is frustrating
just in case you didn't get it after we established it multiple times
:D
A PARTY
gay party?
SSX Dicky
04You're trying to turn the Skyscraper into some sort of superjet
Grace, Dick
lmfao
Roxsnow: lmao
no I'm not
04I'm beginning to realise having a railgun on a jet is impractical
>future
Holy godly batman. We go up giant poles.
okay.jpg
04breaking the aerodynamics
Oh mai.
with tights
04making it a lot heavier
Adam West is so smug
dammit my neighbor is drunk and he keeps setting off the alarm to his car -.-
04and requiring a lot of power
omg... Adam we out of his costume?!?!?!
well
In and out of tights.
propose an alternate then
ONE MILLION DOLLARS

00,10great at getting it out
...
04Such as?
wait...
No idea
04I want Rhy's prowess
how do they...Just...
@_@
dat pole.
how did they change so fast?
Rhy needs something that's not as limited as missiles and more powerful than guns
04to be about skill more than a superawesome jet
magic
yes I know
gotcha
:D
...
good gravy dick!!!
They used Phillip J Frys Thoughts.
dat Dick
04Like going "Fuck you" to someone tailing her and flipping the jet, getting behind them and tearing them to pieces
It certainly is Dick
I think my campy gland has just erupted
04And NS, not really.
LOL
well
good gravy dick...
let's remove the rotating guns
BIFF!

but Sumica, those sexy hips don't lie : 3
04The

better than a railgun
04You're stretching the willing suspension of disbelief NS
lmfao
Alistair has been staring at the wardens hips. and Wynne is noticing.
Drake, it's quite plausible
get back! I have an umbrella!
or at least a dumb missile launcher
.....I play alot of dragon age origins.....
Did Alfred just sorta write a letter to Celestia?
instead of homing missiles
04You have missiles
04And not all missiles are homing
ok... im gonna go to bed now gaiz, night!
I know
04Shit you need to do your homework

gnight Midnight_Tempest
04Then she doesn't need a fucking bazooka
no
man I love this commercial
lol......
the bazooka/cannon/thing launches the dumb missiles
homing missiles are an entirely different stoy
story
and these dumb missiles
Drake, does your TV float during the night?
It's just what I need >_>
Adam West: Dear Princess Celestia, somebody keeps stealing my water.
are far smaller than normal missiles

LOL DERPY.
Derpy!

That is all.

04NS if you want a missile that deals damage but doesn't outright destroy use a rocket pod and just don't launch them all at once
Down in dirt so i can grow a bunch of fluttershy trees. ha ha. Ha. ha.
I take it the next MOV is GLASS.MOV?
That was horrible.

:$
/me facehoofs
/me feels tired.....

nah, I can handle at least another 30 minutes :o
: 3
That's what they all say :P
Lol... Vi just got a bunch of pings out of the sudden :P oh well
still watching RD play with a ball
Aircrafter: Rainbow Dash playing with a ball was the one thing I was missing in life
wants to continue his self destructive path
Roxy what time is it there
I bring success too everyone.
1:36 AM Starflash : o
hmm yeah. go to sleep
night
SadBrony is sad
anyway Drake
so true
I can fix that.
I suppose I can deal with that
=w=
/me just looked at clock...its 4:30 feels like 12:30
[10:37:13]
fillyfillyy: that paddleball passes the time, don't it?
the rocket pod will be in the railgun's previous position
Bureksa etc. europe?
/me is back to playing with paddleball
no one will remember me
04what
Wibbley wobbley time wimey stuff : 3?
04is your
04obsession
huh? ohh yea sure whatever
Sadbrony. This is a new unnofficial treatment that I wish too try out.
04with putting weapons on the jet's back
what?
Roxsnow lol :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJIMQ3aeu_I
why not?
04weapons don't go there
The missiles are on the bottom
it's retractable
:U
/me cuts the string on paddleball
04THAT messes up the aerodynamics
04put them on the wings
so, it seems I won a bet!
yes but it's retractable
no
/me hugs SadBrony
/me replaces string with awsome
SadBrony: NONSENSE MAH BOI, this shall cheer you up http://youtu.be/mghhLqu31cQ
Benfica - Nacional 4-1 Yeah!
How do you feel after having watched Pinkie pie randomly do nonsense for 11 seconds <_<
so you know Starflash : 3
o_O
come on, Drake
Timey wimey, yeah
Omg...Rock NYAN!?
everypony knows that
Aircrafter: YUP!
Vocaloid MEME
Leekz...
/me slaps Drake
Loituma.
trololololol
/me avoids
y r they playing with celery??
no u Drake
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B_FV5DCfrs
but seriously
Aircrafter , look at that video : 3
Its not celery
Its a leek.
it won't mess it up if it's as temporary as Rhy uses it lik
o_o ok
it's all internet memes, isn't it beautiful SadBrony?
/me sighs
04I don't like it
04at all
04but fine
o.o
is no longer sad
...B...
o_
HUZZAH
BRONY!?
Oh hello Bronyking : o
:D
like*
how you return : o?
although
il be gone soon
that /kinda/ defeats the point of having missiles, Drake
since I imagined Rhy flying towards a wall
you must remember me
from above
The KING returns!
letting loose a missile
The KING will live on forever
then flying up
remember the king!
ohai TOY_PON3. You bring the stuff?
divebombing in other words
LOL
04missiles are for aircraft
GOTTA LOVE MEMES.
/me really misses Lyra for some reason.
04rockets are for ground targets
Ohhh yeah...about that...
04done
Yes?
Aircrafter: IKR?
o_O
i will remember you...
/me has frosting all over his mouth and grins
Hi there
:)
Its what makes the internet SPECIAL
O U
rockets are straight line
though
that pretty much makes sense
What about Billy mays? How are we going to bringi him back without sweets?
it does indeed
that song was awesome
ikr?
since it's bloody hard to hit targets with straight-line rocketsanyway
+space
We bring him mighty putty...
that's just crazy enough to work..
rockets are for any static target really, Drake
or slow moving ones
Mighty Putty can fix anything!
Bwooey~
:3
We'll take ALL the mighty putty..
and PUSH it into him.
So, was Airplane aired alst night or?
Um...any modern warfare fans in here?
brb need to get some for realizies
like boats/ships, carrier planes, cargo/transport vehicles, ground vehicles, ground targets, etc.
lol.
makes sense, Drake?
Aircrafter: I've played it
I have something you might like.
Meh.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPeI7tN1jx8&feature=related
wait Placebo: Push it in him from where? :o
04yep
meh
though, Drake, would it be able to destroy a destroyer ship?
I don't really think so
or she'd have to hit it several times? idk
Aircrafter: dat was awesome I gotta admit lol
TOY_PON3: I just brought the streamers, bro. That's your job.
K
/me Gives TOY_PON3 rubber gloves

So therefore, there's not a whole lot to talk about at random ^_^

Eeyup.
k ima post my question
youll find it
I've had more luck finding myself on Omegle.
This is my question
Who is the best pony (My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic) (Rainbow Dash FTW)
Fluttershy for me
whiiiiich I wasn't supposed to answer here (derp)
is it just me or did the internet get faster?
Probably just you
ok then
So I didn't manage to find you yet. But I'm still finding ponies left and right.
Why do they sterilize needles for lethal injections?
Because they'll kill them if they don't
oh, wait..
you'll find theres some legal reason why they have to
unsterilized needles can allso hurt
yeah but its a LETHAL injection
Don't ask, just accept that that's the way it is.
Guess they sterilize them to make it as clean as possible, with reduced risk of unneccissairy pain for the victim
i have so many stupid question its rediculous
Hey guys, what if air is actually poisonous, but it just takes 80 years to kill us?
It actually is
conspiracykeanu.jpg
wat
Oxygen oxidizes our cells, decaying them
LOL
that's why we age
our cells gets more and more damaged
Hm.
You know what? I give up.
I literally have an easier time finding myself thrice on Omegle..
Not easy finding people on Omegle, ey?
I have managed multiple times making myself the asker, Stranger 1 and Stranger 2.
and I can't find Kipkat07.
I'm going to go play Fallout or something.
doh
have fun
Will do. Just finished Dead Money.
That was fun.
I converted someone into a brony on omegle
That is awesome.

So I stabbed him and took his mints
So i saw the summery of the new twilight episode
I can't believe that twilight learns how to travel through time
spoilers dude
It's on EQD
behind a spoiler tag
It won't be out until the 10th of march
How is that a spoiler?
...sorry to break the silence, but what is going on?
because it reveals details that someone who hasn't seen the episode wouldn't know
No one has seen the episode
exactly
-_-
and i believe people have been kicked for episode summary spoilers before
Are you kidding me? They regularly post EQD updates so you get kicked for repeating one of the updates?
Anypony home?
if anyone wants to wach a stream just ask me for the link
then hopefully we can revive this chat with something
FFFFFFFFFFFF :O that
I'm too bored to do anything
(revive the chat, hmm...?) I would even watch a stream of G1 just to have some background noise...
well here's the link www.livestream.co/ishepy
www.livestream.com/isheepy **
...seriously...?...I was only...
I thought we weren't supposed to link...
dont worry the's no G1
OK. What is on?
well if it keeps the chat going then meh

Anything but g1 - g3.5
Howdy' everypony!
Hello Sonic!
Princess_Luna Hi!
Would you mind brushing my mane for a bit? By the way, did you know I've been a filly for a month now? I shouldn't have touched that spell book...
Princess_Luna: we're not using these channels anymore; only for pony episodes
otherwise, these channels are closed
use #bronystate instead
08,01good morro everypony
Hmm...how am I here then? The episodes didn't let me in here? Did you mix up the explanation?
Well, i'm not a very good hair brusher, these quills of mine were grown naturally spiky. And with the filly problem, maybe you should consult Twilight Sparkle
I...don't want to show Twilight...it's kind of embarrassing having your sisters apprentice see you little...
/me 08,01grabs a brush in his mouth and procedes to brush Princess_Luna's mane
08,01DashWithRainbows: why?
08,01it's 2:40pm
its 9:40 AM :P
08,01DashWithRainbows: only if you're offering to be in the same bed
08,01<3
hmmm... true... Try looking in that same book but carefully this time and look for a spell to change you back.
Well...the spell was sort of made by a psychopathic unicorn...I don't think I'll find a cure...
Still ate it anyways.
I have cookies instead of bacon, good enough?
Nope, Bacon always wins.
even against itself.
...aw...
rawr
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCx7RpWme9w&feature=g-hist&context=G27a008aAHTyw13wAAAA
But cookies are high up though.
Tell me where this psychopatic unicorn is and I'll go deal with him myself. No one messes Princess_Luna !!!
Hello, my mailmare! and yes cookies are great...
The unicorn has been dead for five centuries...
Umm... Dang it... (looks embarassed)
It's fine...I've dealed with it thus far...(as long as I make it to a year...)
08,01DashWithRainbows: but... how can you say no to someone drinking a juice box? http://imgur.com/o9uXx
Get Zecora! The Zebra!!!
i need to get ahold of either violetvanilla or any other mod thats awake
/me stares at screaming homer
A potion for a spell...I would sooner jump dimension and look for the Celestiadamned chaos emeralds...
but still, dat juicebox looks mighty tasty.
I can lend you them but I don't know what good they'll do... their more for reviving and giving power, not breaking spells, sigh.
...I'll just wait it out instead...
/me yawns and scratches his eyes...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCx7RpWme9w&feature=g-hist&context=G27a008aAHTyw13wAAAA
If you wish... Say! Maybe you'll cheer up if I bring you to a friend of mine, a hairstylist, he can get you practically any hair style! Even mine if you want! Spikes wouldn't look bad, eh?
:) Not sure what was on the stream after I left, but it seems to have left everypony exhausted
Hi
Morinng
Hmmm...Now that my hair is already stopped glowing and all...I guess it wouldn't hurt Sonic...
Lol
Can I bother somepony by having them check out my drawing?
yeah, sure
just link it here
I don't think so, I would like to see it...
work in progress, fyi
also, bad camera
oh my, that looks good
08,01http://i.imgur.com/fSeJe.png
08,01CountDoofus: that... IS AWESOME
i need to get ahold of either violetvanilla or any other mod thats awake
:O
Looking good, :) I look forward to the finished product
Derpy_Hooves, my mailmare, just PM them by right clicking their name and opening a query.
If I can just find a way to upload that page to my hard drive without using an iPhone camera, that'll be grand
thanks for the comments though :)
tthey are all asleep :P
CountDoofus: You could try buying a scanner
That...sucks...but it explains why ponies aren't getting kicked for links...
stepdad has one, I'll nab his :$
...
chat ded
hnnnngg
How about Hasbro's White Celestia? :)
I love it and I want it naoooo

or red
It was the first pic I saw of that new pony product post
or brown?
Over my dead body
/me takes ALL the vinyl toys
>:3
/me steals VinylScratches stuff
because the first Princess Celestia toy was pink
D:
qq
:P
there shall be pink but Pinkie Pie!
I'll have to spend alot less time on ebay til they are released. Extremely happy about the Vinyl Scratch toy, vinyl has gone quite high in several aucions
*auctions
and that for a background pony that has been in just 1 episode, on screen for no more than 3 seconds
*Vinyl Customs
That NEVER happens! Outlaw Star didnt even produce a full line of character toys!
/me dies of bordom
Gene Starwind & Melfina were the only chara's made into figures.
/me Digs hole puts fullyfillyy in it
/me fillyfillyy *Facehoove*
Then Official Trixie & Nightmare Moon! ^_^ Some of my customs will have to move over
Murrrnapples :3
Ponies the Anthology on YT. you're welcome
/me is burried
If Hasbro is coming out with real Celestia & DJ Pon3 - Derpy Hooves won't be much of a long wait after
or a Doctor Whooves
Yes!
Colgate, Berry Punch, Lyra, Bon Bon... the list goes on ^^
somepony in EQD's comments suggested Hasbro come out with costumes of Daring Do, Mare-Do-Well, Nightmare Night with their Pony Play sets! I'd be happy to buy them, if those costumes were included
the only problem with that is that the costumes would be sized for a 10 year old, at best
or... wait, you mean for the toys?
I'd buy them only for the costumes, but I digress
Yes
for toys
lol
O_O I hope they come out with toys for the creatures Equestria has: Timber Wolves, Ursa Minor, Ahuitzotl, Parasprites...
butbutbut my wallet!
My wallet is light too...from all those customs...
lol, derpy in the land of muffins.
hello everypony is anyone streaming?
hi, and don't think so
sheesh, spent over 180 on a Gilda Griffon custom alone
you have a gilda costume? Awesome!
*anger level rising* Gilda...
lol
Gilda isn't that bad
Hiya guys
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTQazPuO6Z4
Made from an artist in Houston :) Gilda is all Texan ^_^
Just popping in a moment
nopony (or gryphon) makes a Fluttershy cry!
and hi :)
Hiya moop
is there anything on the stream?
At least I can excuse Trixie for just trying to make a living.
No idea
ebay page is gone :( been too long
With Gilda, I can not.
hello moop and otakon17!!!
Hiya mario_pony
(funny how Gilda says part of my nickname in that clip)
i heard on the news someone tried to sell a baby on ebay.
Not surprising
hi otakon17 and mario_pony
http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo309/woosiemlp/Pony%20Customs/gilda1.jpg - This one! Artist Woosie
"Why don't you just watch where you're going, CountDoofus?!" just doesn't sound as good.
They should have used Craigs List
:D
I have to admit i kind of hate Gilda
It's okay. Most bronies do.
I don't hate Gilda
I just really really really really dislike her.
I love her character design.
^
Wat Kammerjunk said
hot dog hot dog hotdog hotdog hot diggedy dog
Um
Until given a voice, character is a blank slate
mario_pony: Have u been watching Mickey Mousapedes?
It's the same with canon Trixie for me. I like the character for the personality, but not because it's a likable character.
nope mickey mouse clubhouse
Ah
Same diff
http://texasbronygroup.4umer.com/t41-pony-collection-thread - posted almost my entire collection here, under Cypresswolf

I may post an updated photo when all my blind bags and other customs come in
I approve of your Trixie, Cypresswolf.

Still waiting on a Shadowbolt to come in ^_^ been 6 months waiting, Im told its almost done and will be shipped soon
08,01Kammerjunk: for a moment, i thought that was a duvet

Kind of like "Oh, Goddesses."

It's fine, I'm only used to ponies saying oh Celestia...I don't mind though!
Yeah, well, Luna is best princess.
Pip says so himself.
Luna is best god bar Eris
Eris just wins
Do ho ho.
I see what you did there.
Eris in pony form
Now
and that's why pip was never seen again.
08,01Luna, you get all my <3
08,01except the <3 i save specially for Molestia
I'm still best princess ri-oh thank you Satuyrn...
Eris pony is the best pony
I wonder if a discodian brony has done a eris pony
artist of the Screwball custom must have a mold made, there's a new one up already
I detest the sun, for it wakes me up during a day off
i share all my <3 equally

Well more "There is always a female version of a male character"
O_o I wonder how I havent gone broke yet. I could have bought a full set of furniture for what I spent on customs since July. Worth it though, fit in quite well with all my anime stuff. :) No one thinks me any weirder
....exactly how much have you spent on customs?
I don't agree on the eris as discord like but female though
Well, let me put it this way...

Honestly, I think everyone is an idiot. That's why we learn through mistakes. It's also why it's important to practice love and tolerance.
i'm not good at proving my self but i admit that yes, i am an idiot
Interesting opinion ...
everyone's an idiot, huh? well then, if you ever find yourself in Belgium, grab your chocolates and run like hell :)

PonyGirl_82: i'm sorry please forget everything i said.

oh hello Athena!!!
I'm sorry to hear that Globetrotter~
Hey mario_pony~
I thought having a cat was cheaper as well till mine decided to get hit by a car last week.
S'alright. He had a good life of being fat.
i had 2 male dwarf hamsters
Now all he eats is canned cat food.
cats are great pets, excetp for the vomit
Did they have beards?
Bluestar: lol
oh hello Athena : 3
I had a hamster. He tried escaping from his cage, fell, and my dog swiftly killed him mid air
Roxsnow!
/me hugs Roxsnow~ <3
/me hugs Athena back : 3
<3
/me hugs everypony!
I had a guinea pig named Bart after Bart Simpson (coz he had a spiky tuft of yellow hair on his head) and a cocker spaniel called Phoebe (after Phoebe Buffay from Friends because she was blond and dumb XD)
/me hugs Globetrotter back

08,01PonyGirl_82: sweet celestia, i know that feeling
Try laughing. It usually warms me up.

I once went camping without a tent
I like alcohol when I'm cold. Doesn't actually warm you up, but you don't care.
That was cold
the film?
Hell no
08,01don't worry, the aunt i mentioned is really just a figment of her own imagination
/me gives PonyGirl_82 a hug and a blanket~
PonyGirl_82: why not?

Nice
05the furries image share site of choice!

Well, if I saw it it would just be seeing your hair for the first time, not seeing its progress.
Ramen with frozen broccolli and canned chicken isn't that bad.
Why not Globetrotter?
PonyGirl_82: why you have no money?
What game is this?
08,01right, you can't really see the hair under the cap in this light

I only have to manage till Thursday night then Friday morning the money will be in my account
I hate to break it to you, but your hair has a plastic bag sheen to it.
Would it be mean to say that I had ultimate chocolate cake today?
;)
thats 4 days, I think I can live on ramen and tomato soup until then
08,01Sumica!
That hair reminds me of bread~

Was that a Phone on the stream?
PonyGirl_82, you can't have tomato soup without grilled cheese.

Howdy everypony.

Everlasting_Joy: Hi.

rawr
What's wrong Everlasting_Joy~
0,5Ohai Derpy_Hooves :3
but there are no places near her that deliver flowers to a PO box
hai lordcelestia
does anypony here live in Boone NC?
I won't go into the details just yet, but let's just say something completely unexpected happened, and it was the worst possible thing that could have happened.
I've recently had the urge to learn how to play the violin or viola
/me 0,5hands Derpy_Hooves a bacon muffin
I don't know why.
wait... is Vis rad radio this week? I cant remember
0,5Aaaw
MasterBrony: just stand outside her window with a jewkbox and play some romantic music
Go to the store and get her some choclates?:)
4 hrs away
/me hugs Everlasting_Joy
08,01Globetrotter: learn the cello
remember:P
0,5I'm sorry to hear that E_J :(
I hope it gets better soon for you :(
its Mission Impossible MasterBrony just send her a card, if she's worth your attentions she'll appreciate that you thought of her, if she's a gold digger and only wants material things, you just dodged a bullet
08,01Globetrotter: if you learn the cello, i can give you skype lessons
Ooh
/me is thankful everyone is so supportive <3.
I'm sorry to hear that Everlasting_Joy~
Cello is rather large though
/me hugs Everlasting_Joy~
Globetrotter: if you learn the guitar, I can give you skype lessons
or the bass
I was going for the other two because it;s something I can carry and guitar is too mainstream oh god did I just say that?
What game is this? DOTA?
Yes you did Globetrotter, and you disgust me.
/me 08,01hugs Everlasting_Joy
hipster!
aaaaaaargh
08,01Everlasting_Joy: we're all here for you if you need to vent
Why me!?
my original plan was to send her 2 roses of each color of RD's tail with a note that says "to the girl thats 20% cooler then the rest"
08,01or just need to get things off your chest
does that sound corny?
/me hugs Everlasting_Joy too
/me gives Globetrotter some ironic glasses
Buy them at a local flower shop and send them USPS?
05is she a brony?
yes
MasterBrony: corny in a good way
05then it will work
/me curb stopms the ironic glasses Pony_Girl82 gave him
oh god it's Valentines day soon
but no place around here or there makes custom bouquets
buck dat shit
08,01that said, i've got something planned...
i don't have school on valentimes day yaay~
MasterBrony: Then I don't know how I can help.
I don't even know what Hallmark is?
sigh
back to the google
does anyone here want a Valentine's card?
08,01lemme just find it
Vamlumtimes day is serious times!
thanks anyway everypony
http://www.hallmark.com/online/

08,01Everlasting_Joy: not really; i just don't need a specific day as an excuse to show someone how i feel about them
^
Bluestar is is srs bis (TGS <3)
Valentines is just another day for me. If it weren't for it being all over everywhere. I'd probably not even remember what day it was

ScootaChicken

LOL ScootaChicken
Valentine's Day is a very big day for me. I work for FedEx. :-(
Valentines day is a reminder day. If your significant other hasn't gotten you anything for long enough for you to care about Valentines day...
I work for...oh wait, I'm unemployed
Ah Tescos Value, how would I live without your nutritionally deficient cheap crud <3
Do you do singing telegrams Krakass?
Krakass I'm sorry to hear that.
ikr PonyGirl_82
valentines day is just another day for girls to bitch about how much you don't love them.
Sundaysmile, oh god no. I'd come home covered in rotten vegetables.
We appreciate your work, Krakass.
I'm holding a forever alone LAN party with my mates.
valentines day is a day when you can send a girl flowers and she's like "awww" but any other time of the year and you're a stalker
We're going to play Age of Empires 2
omg cool
I love AOE2
Damn straighgt

Sundaysmile Yes, yes it's all true.

Forever alone LAN party with mates on valentines day, totally not homo
Pony_Girl82 Imagine if they remade AOE2 on a modern engine?

it was incredibly gay
hey now

I like LOTR
Same here,
Globetrotter: yes, gay in a FABULOUS way
LOL
Infact I'm a bit of a Tolkien-geek
I, too, enjoy spending my time gaily.
Tolkien ftw
We should totally get together and play AOE2 whilst watching LOTR
we should watch the director's cut of LOTR here at some point
I'm down with that XD pity you're so far away from me
We did
Globetrotter: c: HI!

"I'll give wal-mart a few more days before I just cave and order a couple blind bags from Amazon." I said, not knowing that the very next day Bronies would buy out the blind bag sets, and thus the Amazon price would more than double. Well, fuck me.
oh hello Dismo : 3
Is this League of Legends? Why is Derpy using colored text?
DerpyHooves`: Oh, quite good to know I'm not breaking the rules! ;D

Dovashy: the rules have always excluded outside links except for pictures, but a lot of the time the mods only really care if it's Youtube videos
mario_pony: I feel thine pain.
Don't wario mario_pony It gets better.
Yup, Globetrotter went through puberty before it was cool.
tee hee hee
06^ Ponies. . . no worries sweets. . . You may post image links, but out of respect for the stream youtibe links during a mane stream are out. You may still PM them to each other ^^

Well yesterday during the film some bronies in here were very rude to me about complaining about spoilers/links/etc. Basically suggesting I had no right to my opinions. So excuse me if I'm a little defensive when people start questioning me
Do what I did mario_pony

Bluestar: lol i will

^ ^ /) question! I'm a filly just in case you didn't know. Can I still have cider?
/me giggles
08,14Of course you can sweetie <3

I love your videos!
Why RJ?
Glad ya like 'em

Globetrotter: Yeah, it's the same over here in Denmark. You can buy beer and cider from the age of 15, too.
Is it really you MrPoniator?
well your still a filly
Apparently
Aww...so...
Princess_Luna come to England, then you can drink whatever you want whatever you're age as long as it is in the privacy of your own home
/me puts a shot of vodka in Princess_Luna's cider when she isnt looking
if a little girl watches MLP FiM is she considered a brony?
Succubus1982* can't spell my own user name
man it sucks being underage!
moop: Yes. Always.
Wait, little girls watch this show?
I have to wait another year before I can drink. Legally
/me put's ethanol in Princess_Luna's cider
mario_pony: Not over here, it doesn't.
It hasn't affected my judgement much...
mario_pony: so true
you're not missing much AttackWithHugs
I will return shortly...though my username will still be here.
Ah.
Kammerjunk: why not over there?
Likewise AttackWithHugs
08,14See you soon Princess_Luna c:
neat
I love being underage. It means people expect less from me.
08,146.9
I'm 15, and I drink on a oh-hey-a-party basis.
Same
Except I'm 17
Have done so for what, 2-3 years now.
So I'm more awesome
hehehe
if you go out to drink it bankrupts you and if you stay in to drink you always drink too much
Globetrotter: I'm 20
Kammerjunk: law breaker!!!!!!!
Ten points to Athena!
mario_pony: Not in Denmark.
I'll be 30 in March
Nice Valentines day card Athena : 3
Im 15 and i drunk 2 bottles of beer when i didn't get drunk i felt bad
/me hugs Athena <3
/me hugs AttackwithHugs
05big fight time!
AttackWithHugs you have to be 21 to drink I have to be 18
PonyGirl_82: wwwwhhhhhhaaaaaaaatttt!!!???
/me hugs Roxsnow back~
Princess Luna was here
????
beer tastes like shit
Globetrotter: Lucky you
WHERES MAI WAIFU!!??
moop I agree.
I don't know what either taste like.
AttackWithHugs Yeah. Totally.
Only shitty beer tastes like shit.Good beer tastes like beer.
Let's go with that.
i like beer
german dark beer is best
08,14^
08,14Though I prefer wein .-.
a bunch of people in my school drink and do drugs an d smoke i just think their a bunch of dumbasses
Coors Light is best beer.
mead is good
also im never ever ever ever ever gonna smoke cigarretes again
;-)
and i like coors light
/me prefers wine >w>....
/me has coocokes
cookies*
/me prefers vodka mixers cos he's apparently badass
I don't drink :)
..
mario_pony: Quite.
mario_pony: u are judging them
Losers don't do drugs.
moop: Good for you! I've lost more friends to cigarettes than I have pennies to vacuums.
/me gets really drunk with wine REALLY easily =w=;;;
tequila is my fav liquor
it's funny my cousin did drugs now his mom loves me more than him.
moop - it's not entirely unjustified
I kind of like vodka.
05goan grab dinner brb
Vodka is best liquor.
Well every one judges people puts them into stupid catgoriesWe all do and its natural ... but its not right
Krupnik
Try that.
I dont really have a critical taste for liquor. I just drink it XD
moop - it depends on whether the category is a justified one
moop: Vodka is best liquor because it's used to make Taste the Rainbow.
http://tinyurl.com/7alj6ys
i don't have full context on what's going on, but what i see is a bunch of high schoolers are smoking and drinking
Vodka Skittles?
Yes please
Kammerjunk: what is justified?
what that tells me is they have little respect for the laws (smoking until 18; drinking until 21, etc)
To judge is natural. To act indifferential to how you've judged another is righteous.
Drinking is 18 over here MirrorImage
moop: I don't know, what did I say? I can't remember.
Globetrotter: Ha! 16 or something here.
Globetrotter - and here it's 21, but i'm still talking about high schoolers
I honestly don't know the exact age.
I will say this: Farenheit makes more sense for day to day temperatures than Celsius
I don't know what a high schooler is
You have a different school system
08,14-10c here. . .
08,14.-.
thats pretty cold :p
does anypony here work for the military?
08,14feels cold mann. .
08,14;A;
high school here is equivalent of years 9-12
i have a question for them if they do
Evening everypony
DepyHooves`: Laugh through the cold!
heya Frank
evening'
evening, Frank
Evening Frank!
:D
Hello, the man who stopped wars.
Ahh, so I would be in the last year of high school then MirrorImage year 12? First year of 6th form over here.
I've been the cycle for liquor, cocktails of all flavours and contents, wines, beers, ales, liqueurs, sometimes even neat liquor. Nowadays though I can't stomach much more than a glass of wine
-2 `C here :{)
Its been the warmest winter here... 50 F average per day 0_0
It's 4C here. Personally, I think anything below 13C is cold.
year/grade 12 here is the last year of public school
MasterBrony: I will be conscripted into the army this autumn
I'm not a cold person, as you might see.
ok

AttackWithHugs: I would only donate my brain to Cave Johnson.
how old are you Princess_Luna?
what are said laws my sweet Princess Luna?
I'm a woman

ta ta Lord_Greener~
I mean LordCelestia~
oh come on, why is the dog the only one that gets a closeup?
/me loves to brushie Princess Luna
/me loves being brushied
Will any pony be my special somepony?

I will moop
if you could have any superpower what would it be and what would your name be?
05casue he has extra crit
I would like...a muffin!
05they closeup when they crit
Bluestar: Does this also work for long-distance because my boyfriend and his pals are about 2 and a half hours away from me
Globtrotter: yay
i would have the power to become an Alicorn
Any superpower...the ones that I have.
and my name would be Brony-man
To be able to transform into any animal or object mario_pony
hmm. ok. I guess that makes sense.
I would shapeshift into Pinkie Pie
/me gets Luna a miffun
and I would be called George
/me noms muffin
Muffffinsss~
hey my name is jorge wich is george in spanish
Awesome
/me hands Athena a muffin
I'm actually called George
/me brings Luna a tray of rare deliquicy muffins
/me noms on muffin <3
Yay~
The amount of teasing you get from that names is ridiculous over here.
AttackWithHugs: Yes, it most certainly does. It simulates a LAN server, but it isn't restricted to a local network.
i would have the power to shapeshift and my name would be jrgn8r
/me would like a muffin =w=.....
NO
these are for LUNA
Bluestar: Awesooooome
/me gives Roxsnow a muffin :#
:3*
I can give a muffin or two.
/me hides muffins from the rest of the ponies
thank you Athena : 3
/me noms on Muffin : 3
AttackWithHugs: I should mention though, everyone who wants to join the server will need the program in the link.
only the royal tongue can taste THESE muffins
MasterBrony, you should start giving a muffin...
/me noms homemade ultimate chocolate cake

I remember seeing that moooop~
/me gets no welcoming hellos :(

HELLO emangamer !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ohai emangamer
Wrek whats this gamr called?
OWWWW...dammit that hurt
/me gives Princess_Luna some homemade ultimate chocolate cake "Sorry."
Is this the work of SB64 bad skills?
/me takes the cake from globetrotter and gives it to Princcess Luna
05Heroes of Might & Magic 6

T-thank you Globetrotter *sniff*

/me steals cake
brb everypony. I need to do something magical!

That's so cool :)
AttackWihtHugs: No its a tire
Nice alliteration Athena : 3
the radioation from nuclear war turns us all into ponies?!?!?!
((mario_pony, you are stuck on the ceiling with reverse polarity. Leave the building and you will fly into the sun))
my sister is listening to sexy and i know it.
FIRE THE MISSLES!!!!
Thanks~
Athena, moop: A tire in Equestria? WITCHCRAFT!
I'm back.
mario_pony: im listening to die die my darling the metallica version
ohai Everlasting_Joy
moop: That could be a wheel to a carriage.
girl look at that body girl look at that body i work out
Hi Jim!
welcome back Everlasting_Joy : 3
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle wiggle wiggle, yeah!
I think equestria is what would happen if you turned on the GECK in fallout 3~
Princess_Luna: i think it's way to thick
Howdy Roxsnow.
oh and mario_pony: WIGGLE WIGGLE WIGGLE WI- damnit AttackWithHugs
when i walk on by girls be looking like damn he fly!@
I know it sort of looks like a tire...but Earth is in a seperate dimension.
im telling you its the radiation from nuclear fallout....FIRE TEH MISSLES!!!
we turn into ponies from the radioation
MasterBrony now now, first have a nap.
String_Shredder: I see the video everytime I sing it.
why do i need a nap?!?
Mutations + GECK = Ponies~ I think
Any pony played Bastion?
me too
we have missles ot launch!!!
Princess_Luna: how can it be? They have only one sun. They Have very similar thecnological advances
Ooh, this pony loves Bastion, flutter_spin.
just because they have a tire doesn't mean that it's Earth
I've been contemplating in getting it. Not sure if its worth my money
it just means they've discovered vulcanized rubber
Princess_Luna: a similar atmosphere
moop: I...don't question further...
the implication is no different than another alien culture discovering that pure oxygen is flammable
You know, they could have tires for their carriages.
this shit is bananas b ana na
help me launch the nukes......WE NEED TO BECOME PONIES!!!
They DO have trains you know.
I like trains...
/me trots up to MasterBrony "buit i already am a pony
If you like smooth and reliable gameplay, beautiful environments, enthralling narrative and strong-silent-type MCs, Bastion is a great game to pick up.
But the trains are pulld by ponies, mostly
/me presses the huge red button right next to the coffee machine button "ops"
Oops*
Except the one that goes to Canterlot
Princess_Luna: noooo!!! *get hit bye train*
radiation turns us into ponies....we must cause the radiation falllout.....RALLY TO ME, MY BRETHREN!!
The trains are pulled by a steam engine AttackWithHugs
Oh no Athena...you hit the muffin button. And sorry moop!
/me survived and is back
Globetrotter: I know. I was thinking of the one in Over A Barrel

Athena run for the hills!
/me runs to the fallout shelter~
Quicly! Get in!
It was the muffin button you pressed, nopt the one for nukes.
/me and the sky rains muffins on all the unsuspecting ponies
Princess_Luna: it didn't hurt that much actually cause i can't feel my lower half of my body
Our nuclear bombs haven't even been developed fully yet...
/me and those in the fallout shelter got no muffins

http://derpy.me/2vFah
what language?
This chat is getting ridiclous.
^
yay
^
Just a little bit
flutter_spin: That was HILLARIOUS ^^
/me "How is that so RawketLawnchair, you are the one with...that name"
Don't make me put on my battle armor... http://images.wikia.com/saintseiya/images/7/72/Athena_clothlkoggh.jpg
/me glomps luna
agreed RawketLawnchair
that is some godly armor Athena @w@....
The whole video is funnier in the comments below
But that part just cracked me up
OK, stop MB, or I will leave...
So...any stream soo? :)
soon*
I'm leaving until there is some semblance of sanity.
/me "Athena, I admire your armour. It is well crafted"
/me cries
is there ever sanity here?
Athena: I would hate to go up against you..even though that will never happen
Princess_Luna: where will you go? the moon?
I hate that when ever i go on to any website people make fun of me cause i'm a brony
RL, you were causing most of the insanity..
lawl panting like a bitch
moop except here.
Thanks~
why would you leave a poor defenceless foal like me?
Ingwaz, I find that offensive...
/me pulls MasterBrony off of Princess_Luna
Athena 's armor is best armor : 3
Thank you mario_pony...
Princess_Luna: i hate that for you then
/me bites mario_pony
/me Slaps MasterBrony with a large trout
Everlasting_joy: Thats cause this site kicksass
Roxsnow: I know right? :)
/me dodges the trout
so of a ****
Ingwaz? Did you say you hate me?
moop: Go to the bethesda forums. No one really harrasses you and we have our own Brony thread
/me "MasterBrony, because you, colt, are being too friendly"
Princess_Luna: nope, "i hate that for you then"
Indeed TOY_PON3 : 3
/me grabs MasterBrony
my mom came in. Had to hide.
Oh K.
/me bites mario pony again
tgl1992: i'll try that
I think...therefore I want a cookie.
/me ties MasterBrony up
Ingwaz: comas, they're a life saver
/me gives Princess_Luna a cookie
:)
/me picks up MasterBrony, carries himout of the room and then locks the door.
Thank you TOY_PON3!
son of a ***** bit me!!
/me teleports himself back to lunas arms
You're welcome Princess :3
Princess_Luna, instead of making MasterBrony a foal, why not petrify him?
/me "MasterBrony can fly and is a unicorn?"
...good idea.
Tarku: how would a comma have changed the meaning of "i hate that for you then" at all?
im an ALICORN FOAL!!!
/me petrifies MasterBrony as a foal
No you aren't
/me "Pray tell, is MasterBrony an alicorn or merely a gifted unicorn?"
is nothing on:(?
/me unpetrifies himself
Now you are petrified though...
Ingwaz: "I hate that for you, then" would be proper
im an ALICORN
/me aliSLAP
Its always the Alicorns huh : /
*petrifies and puts him in Celestia's room*
/me snickers
Well, a nice stature never hurts...
you know what sounds fun?
oh dear....
playing gothem city imposters
/me unpetrifies himself and sstart crying.....
What Derpy?
Roxsnow: I'm no Alicorn I'm a talented unicorn :3
amazing TOY_PON3 : 3
Tarku: i disagree, a comma denotes a slight pause in the speech. The phrase I typed needs no pause and is meant to not have one. It would however, have been proper to include the comma had the statement continued on after that to include something else
My oc~: http://imgur.com/NLpdw
/me covers MasterBrony's mouth with tape
Good for you then PON3
Derp_Hooves: That's awesome

I guess...
That's a cool OC
Thank you~
Mine is just simple, but it still works :)

Alicorn OCs are not generally accepted, but as long as she doesn't act like a Sue, I'm fine...
Simplicity is sometimes best ya know TOY_PON3 =w=

Roxsnow: Indeed

/me "but all the stories agreed on one thing, if you cut off of it's head, it grows two more!"
@_@

ScootaChicken: lol
What happend to the dragons discord was reviving?
ARROW TO THE KNEE!
People does not care for arrow to the knee jokes
eeyup
tis in bad taste
I don't like the joke. I didn't like it in the game and it wasn't funny after I heard it the second time
arrow in the knee jokes were never funny
I had no idea what the arrow to the knee jokes were about until I actually heard a guard say it XD
I only heard it once in-game
I agree with ScootaChicken~
I USED TO NOT CAR FOR THEM..... THEN I TOOK AN ARROW TO THE KNEE!
making fun of arrow in the knee jokes was only slightly more funny
I heard it everywhere.
Then i got a RAINBOW to the knee
I didn't car about anything, but I cared about it~
CARE
I used too hate My little pony, But then I got a season one too the brain.
^^

will somepony please hold me? im a poor defenseless alicorn foal.....
I started watching MLP Season 2 Episode 4. I saw an episode or two and started from scratch.
this conversation needs more ponies... *puts on pokemon hat* Thaats better!
Then rewatched the whole thing in a week
where is SaxyPretender...
Started following the series after that
Found out about bronies from the Learn about Meme video
/me feels ignored and leaves the chat to go do other pony things
The reason I dislike it is that my firend made the worst joke, *guy just got out of the hospitol with a broken knee* Friend: I used to be able to walk... then I broke my knee. *punch*
Vi radio isn't the same without Saxy's presence ;____;
my eyes hurt
And... everything followed after that
I miss Saxy..
hope we go to sesson 8,atleast, like ranma did..
I miss ranma 1/2...

[/me is going to shower
0,5I like this song
I miss Best Fort
^
agreed TOY_PON3|Drawing
lol. I watched Ranma on Toonami Aftermath
this song already <3
i watch the whole series.
What i think of the show?
Fucking... GENIUS
/me " Lake unguwandura was massive, many miles in circumference"
Ranma was weird. It started off interesting and then just got nutty later on. I stopped who knows when.
Wait.. New pony toys? HUZZAH!
/me "But the surface was flat, reflective like a mirror, reflecting the place blue sky"
I think it had to be the grandpa. Ruined it
The last episode.
i really hope that new set makes its way to the uk
/me "It was quite hypnotic really"
Atleast watch that.
PLease.
Athena: New mes?
NMM looks brilliant
Indeed?
I know I really outdid myself with White Celestia

/me 08,01completely forgot
I'm sad though....
rawr
damn missed Drake
have a hug otakon
I missed alot of the show bc of LAG!
/me hugs otakon
damn you LAG DAMN YOU!
08,01otakon: that was a poster that someone at st andrews rotary club asked me to design
thanks Princess_Luna
09,01I think I understand after rereading a bit....however, would that really be a good idea? Considering the fact that, aside from the money, several of our staff members do not have ponysonas. Myself included.
ah
08,01LadyCanary: bright pink
You are welcome.
No WAI.
/me 08,01going a bit pinkie pie
Silly filly.
aww you guys dont?
LadyCanary: imagine a 6 ft scotsman with pink hair
....Mother of god.
09,01some do
and I mean SCOTSMAN
otakon :O
what?
One does not simply go a little bit Pinkie pie.
Is steam derping for anyone else?
he IS a Scotsman
Just like in Samurai Jack!
Jim: it's over for now is all
with the kilt and everything...
oh god, I realised I have to cut my hair tomorrow ;____;
Ewwwww.....
09,01I don't. I don't really feel comftable with being a pony. I like picturing myself as a human...it's my pride in my species.
I mean STEAM, not stream
lol
Scoot-Scootaloo Same here...
09,01Maybe because I am in the medical field?
Freaky...
oh
I mean ScootaChicken.
people who have seen my hair will know how much of a loss this will be
-_-
x3
prolly
Did someone say STEAM?
09,01but in any case
ScootaChicken: Crew cut
is anypony streaming or is my internet down?
09,01several of our staff members do
otakon: nope.
09,01albeit not all of them
no stream atm
mario_pony no one is streaming.
/me pats ScootaChicken on the back.
get a crew cut ya HIPPY!
08,01LadyCanary: here it is after bleaching: http://imgur.com/DJeDl
09,01from the admin staff...I think only Luna. And that's because she's. Well. Luna.
SaxyPretender: I won't be able to wear my hair in a ponytail anymore ;____;
o____o
like I said LadyCanary imagine THAT with pink hair
...?
and a kilt
He will be BESTEST PINKIE PIE
dat hair
it wont be the same if not all of you have ponysona's so iguess it wont work :<
with a bastard sword
09,01I have a provisional ponysona but I don't like whipping it out. Mainly because of what I said earlier. And maybe also because I don't like being associated with a pony...I'd rather be associated with myself.
um
08,01<3
/me is a grown alicorn again
Beard off?
.....It'd be like 1,000 pinkie pies singing at once...
I wonder what would happen if I dyed my hair pink...
Beard off.
09,01well there's the fact that
his beard outranks mine by far
and then all getting hit by a tain.
train*
09,01we also have several artists on board as well
mind you, my hair is completely black
i wanna grow a mustache like marios someday!
09,01myself included
getting it pink would be rather difficult
ScootaChicken: you'd look ridiculous
09,01(even if I only sketch random crap....)
have some pinkie pie
otakon: nope. I'd look epic.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSbX0HYWFfk
ofc, so would I
I like trains...
09,01thing is, a project like that should be discussed with the art department, mayhaps
*hit by train*
09,01as well as the administrators, because it constitutes a partnership.
Sorry!
09,01In other words, you should propose that project to my bosses
whee watching Star Wars Ep III on dvd
