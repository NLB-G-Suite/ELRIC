Exactly
HAHA
Do it HUB!
and We actually make the showings
Blackbird is an example.
EVERYPONY WINS
04Could blackbird engage in frantic dogfights?
Depends.
04We're going for as realistic as possible while still maintaining drama/action
plus, I'll buy the lesser demanded figures
lol
HUBDan rocks
well
I might as well record them, until my parents see that I am am and are disappoint.
I suppose a blackbird could have weapons.
Yeah that.
As in this afternoon, this afternoon?
^
....Eh....Maybe later though....
04I can't imagine a blackbird doing the kind of stunts I'm imagining.
04Dunno why
Eh...I'll give it some time...

/me still feels a mod is among us
Hmmm...

Now too listen too some smooth Jazz.
04Basically
04Rhy comes swooping down

and win it
04fires the railgun
Unless they get back up.
04and blows up a wall
Here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SboSv6diNOw
04The railgun would be hard to use against a plane NS
I always win thank you very much

Its precision, not spread.
Thanks now I need pills
how fast is it?

04Very.
mfw I realize how many ships i've read lately.
>_>;
04The bullet is like, instantaneous.
Honeslty, gatling laser would make it seem more realistic/fair.

I say the railgun takes time to charge on Rhy's aircraft
04NS of course
but its weight is reduced as a result

It's always forward facing

two double-barrelled rotating/gatling guns
:P
ooo zat looks good
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OBkq_AkzV8
Yes, Yes!
*fast
also guns that are situated at the end of the wings
Everyone likes me.
I have no idea!
probably some on the wings too
and a couple of missiles
-puts on sunglasses- Cause I'm a Boss.
;o;
04I don't think you'd need more than two guns
HEHEHEH
04Two on the body, right next to the wings
/me explodes, like a BAAAAWWWSSS
04or on the nose
WOWOOOOW
04either way, the barrels would be hidden inside the hull to aid with aerodynamis
04aerodynamics*
same here
04Maybe
044 cannons then
Got'cha.
@_@
You play flight sims

04Yes

the gatling ones are attached to the main body/hull
you can if you try!
I'm on Assult Horizon ALL the time
I know right?
but 2 separate cannons are on the wingtips
04Why
okay fine
none on the wingtips
04No, NS
04Explain to me

it's for ships that have a different size/shape

Gamertag
well
04Are you saying the guns on the wings would point to the sides?
mine's MetaMiek
lol i forgot
oops!
lol
Rhy just has them anyway, k?
or she can have retractable guns that come out from inside the wings
:(
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if4RJd7UF30&feature=bf_next&list=LL_NHpcOwW6HoNa7XqEaDn4w&lf=mh_lolz appropriat
04But if you have the gatling guns already why would you need guns on the wings
/me is sad now
from watching\
04The wings are too thin for a gun to be on them in the first place.
04You can attach missiles on the wings because all they need is to be attached and detached

04you
04stupid
/me headdesks
ded!
that's why I said rotating guns, idiot
D:
oh dat alfred
can somone catch me up on whats happening?
[18:46:37] <~Armageddon> but most of them are forward facing
[18:46:44] <Drake> Rotating guns?
[18:46:48] <Drake> You mean gatling guns?
[18:46:52] <~Armageddon> whatever you call them
:D
04I thought
brb
04when you said rotating
Annnd BREAK!
/me runs off
no
04you meant the guns with multiple barrels that spin
nooooo
whyyyyyyy
no need for that
04a lot
she already has a mass of guns
O_o
these are for fuckers on her tail
^
00,10soon™
they don't constantly rotate
Thats just plain scary.
04When a plane has enemies on their tail they manouever to get around them
otherwise that'd be too hard to control
yes
HAHAHAHA:D
but still
04Not spin their guns around
/me is not sure to feel scared or wtf
rotating guns are fun
Night, all
and by whatever year we're in
04Because then it's not a plane it's just a fucking weapons platform
we're bound to have them
dude
04And why the fuck would a company give Rhy a weapons platfornm
or today you mean
-sigh- My dreams always go unfufilled.
and they didn't give it to Rhy
she modified it
00,10need that picture
04A gun
04on a plane
04does
04not
04rotate
/me rolls eyes
/me hugs The_4th_Walls
04because
04THEN
it also attacks enemies from the side
04You're overpowering her
okay fiiiiiiine
yup
04Missiles, 6 machine guns
04a RAILGUN
00,10blatherskype
railgun needs time to reset its position
04Not to mention the TYPES of missiles she has
well
I don't think she can have more than 4 missiles
04And the railgun does not rotate
00,10Ducktales actaly
of course not you fucktard
why would THAT rotate
^
04Then why do you say "reset its position"?
because
it fires
yes
yup
00,10dem hips
You can rewrite history...
Yes please.
and as to not overpower it
just saying it needs to reset the mechanics
then load the next bullet
: 3
04ok
04fine
Cool
[18:43:05] <~Armageddon> Let's put it this way
04Honestly I'm starting to think it doesn't need a railgun
[18:44:00] <~Armageddon> It's always forward facing
[18:44:05] <~Armageddon> no rotating
[18:44:20] <~Armageddon> And it's mounted inside the aircraft like the missiles
[18:44:37] <~Armageddon> and when activated, pops out and fires

and that for a background pony that has been in just 1 episode, on screen for no more than 3 seconds
*Vinyl Customs
That NEVER happens! Outlaw Star didnt even produce a full line of character toys!
/me dies of bordom
Gene Starwind & Melfina were the only chara's made into figures.
/me Digs hole puts fullyfillyy in it
Murrrnapples :3
Ponies the Anthology on YT. you're welcome
/me is burried
Yes!
the only problem with that is that the costumes would be sized for a 10 year old, at best
or... wait, you mean for the toys?
I'd buy them only for the costumes, but I digress
Yes
for toys
lol
butbutbut my wallet!
My wallet is light too...from all those customs...
hello everypony is anyone streaming?
lol
Hiya guys
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTQazPuO6Z4
Just popping in a moment
nopony (or gryphon) makes a Fluttershy cry!
and hi :)
is there anything on the stream?
At least I can excuse Trixie for just trying to make a living.
No idea
Not surprising
"Why don't you just watch where you're going, CountDoofus?!" just doesn't sound as good.
They should have used Craigs List
:D
I just really really really really dislike her.
^
Um
It's the same with canon Trixie for me. I like the character for the personality, but not because it's a likable character.
Same diff
But WRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYY?
is cuz my younger brother loves it.
Fanon Trixie, however, I absolutely adore.
I've bought alot more customs since then
08,01gilda is awesome
08,01i <3 her
Oh Saturn
Hi
08,01she's just got a lot of rage

XD
Odl
08,01but i've offered her help and advice
Odl
oh gos lion king's on.
I found a few potential helpers
*god
But they need details
08,01Kammerjunk: for a moment, i thought that was a duvet
08,01that would be AWESOME
Saturn: Oh, Luna.
Yes?
That's awesome and terrifying at the same time.
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/internet-memes-its-a-conspiracy.jpg
Saturn: I thought the same
I was like man any one with that for their bedding <3
then it wasn't bedding :(
Kind of like "Oh, Goddesses."
the circle of liiiiiffffeeeee!!!
It's fine, I'm only used to ponies saying oh Celestia...I don't mind though!
Do ho ho.
Now
08,01Luna, you get all my <3
I detest the sun, for it wakes me up during a day off
i share all my <3 equally

it's the gender swap rule
Well more "There is always a female version of a male character"
....exactly how much have you spent on customs?
Well, let me put it this way...
*thinks a moment*

Or, because they inverted it for some reason, Might & Magic Heroes VI.
Ayup everypony!
(Series has been known as Heroes of M&M for five parts, but somehow it makes sense to now invert the title)
