There's hundred of Vocaloid songs out there.
And literally a song with declaring war is popular
And people aren't aware of the meaning of the song.
The masses interpretation is not allways concurrent with that of the artists.

Photonic sneeze reflexes?
13bright light makes you sneeze
I don't have that
13for me it's usually when i'm brushing out my hair, the tingling from pulling out knots coupled with the light tends to send me into sneezing fits .-.

I can imagine- ee
Sometimes my palate starts itching for no reason and I end up sneezing my lungs out
At least you don't have a cleft palate

Dunno- curiosity I guess

lol
Hello.
not to 100%
No stream right now?
woo s4
not really, I think
I think 13 episodes is because of DHX contracts and some time constraints
but next season was said to be full length, according to..Andrew something
no, they saidn ext is full length a long time ago
but that means s4 wont be until fall 2013
nooo
Could the movie be this summer then?
no, there's no movie being worked on I think
I think DHX bought a studio, and had to complete some contracts that wouldn't allow them to do 25 episodes- but don't quote me on that
I think a movie is a foregone conclusion
only 13 episodes, a half season. I think they are pacing them selves for something
yeees
he als osaid "Seasons" on purpose he said
so- s5 is possible
6 seasons and a movie
I doubt there's a movie coming noow, but maybe near the end of the run
I think I heard that
PPG, Foster's, KND, a few more I forget, are all 6 seasons and a movie
?
Fister's is six?
damn- I need to get those
I only saw 2
she doesnt write for them anymore
not fanfics
I also thought they aren't encouraged to look into fanfics
oh okay

Faust hasn't been involved since season 1
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/6/19/iQSxUQ5pxU6YoA9wKSydrA2.png
Faust did a great dev work though
Faust isn't part of the regular crew any more but she still works as a consultant
I don't think she consults anymore either
since faust left the show has been going down in quality slowly
He husban is working on she show, Faust still has some influence
her*
I think the show has increased in quality greatly since s1, and I thank thiessen and the other leaders of the show
She was involved at all? I thouht she stopped consulting iiin mid s1
Nah, she didn't know anything bout the season closure for instance
as in other people boucing ideas off of her
Okay, I haven't looked into it, but yeah she did consult for a while

I can't move I'm stuck in ice
13IN OTHER NEWS
instead, we should talk about season 3?
not allowed. spoilers are forbidden
I know spoilers are forbidden, but surely there is a difference between speculation and spoilers
We shouldn't discuss either, especially if speculation is based on spoilers-
Alright spoiling times.Trixie is coming back in S3......that bitch needs to die already
Hey

How about no?
kthnx
my goal to avoid all spoilers people throw at me.

But but trixie is worst pony
But everyone already knows
Not to me she's not
and till now it worked pretty good
Yeah, it's getting harder though
I mean even EQD is something I avoid in fear of episode names or pictures now-
one post said "We all know now that'''' is returning"
i even avoid pony talks with friends
and was like "WHAT!?"
....
thats why he posted that
I know, but that post wasn't about Trixie

Hello Guys :)
Hiya
hello everypony:)
dont need that there anymore.
Monday, it all happened. I had every tooth in my head ripped out (and there was much blood) and am not wearing "training" dentures that are irritating and somewhat wobbly.
that might have interesting chst reactions
finally got a normal Music Project to work on again, A Waltz version of This day Aria, siddenly came to my mind, I always wanted to make a Waltz
dutch is fun to know
hi again. My web browser derpd. 6_9
especially when people from forgein language try to pronounce duth sentences
the accents
they make me laugh
maybe, but I dont want to invest at least 2 years to know a fun language if Its not practical for me.
the stream is broke
you're right
is the stream broke for everypony else?
like--chh noise?
yomeone fix it
also that
gtg I'll be back alter :3
but brittish people for example
and no, we only "flem"on the letter P
like instead of a mild ch noise, they like hack their throat and choke on the noise
/me feels weird
you know, like a parody
thats all.
to be fair though, getting the th right isnt that easy either^^
jaai heeh tuuhr
Mornin' everyone :)

You see, I give no shit towards politics, but it made a reference to Coke and Pepsi tasting similar.
kk?
05,15I belive there isn't a stream on at the moment
05,15Pepsi is clearly superior
I was making a point?
coke and pepsi taste the same
05,15Pepsi is sweeter
and it has a milder taste IMO
especially from plastic bottles
08,01pepsi is vile deathdrink
|Dr Pepper beats both Coke and Pepsi
never heard of it Saturn
I personally don't see the difference between coke an pepsi
*and
Saturn: Any fruit soda > Cola... And add in Ice Cream :p
Saturn: Is that a regional soda only?
Well that answered that
