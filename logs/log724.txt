well... That was interesting
13J_E_Smith71: i'm sure other eps will get voted more
the terms of ghost and shell are meant to be more poetic. You could think of them as physical body and supernatural eternal soul instead

05,15First you have to register with the federal election comission, then you receive your voter I.D. Card, then you click on the link on the front page and select an eppisode
0,14and yes, those reasons too
05,15God I'm tired
fluttercry what now??
0,14as am I
SaxyPretender: so slow computer. :P
Man I can't decide which ep to pick:p
net won't loooaaaaaaad.
SaxyPretender: Sonic "You're too slow!"
well actually I was about to vote the show stopper but I feel like Cutie Mark Chronicles is essential
I am tired it is now 4am and I have school in a few hours... :D
0,14the one time I tried to test streaming, it broke my webcam driver
/me brohoofs fluttercry for making the newsletters and announcements
Scoot-Scootaloo: You're too cheap.
0,14I don't even know how that happens
so there
05,15RDash5000 (\
did someone say my name?
No.
Scoot-Scootaloo did you need someting?
Eqd post my song I need feedback so I can improve
(and I guess I'll have to do my own 2 season marathon on sunday)
Meanwhile: You're too meanie!
Wait
SaxyPretender that shouldn't be possible. O.o
I mean they need to
Scoot-Scootaloo: Silver: "It's no use! It's no use! It's no use! How bout this?"
I made it my picture on Skype and changed my named to Mitten Ropmney
Phase4
05,15I still haven't tested streaming. I'm 98% sure my internet and computer can handle it. I just...haven't got around to it yet
JRP, busy
13HEY CHEESE BRAIN
HEY
ASS BUTT
fluttercry: might wanna test that :d
HOLD IT
OBJECTION
13HEY TROLL BAIT
05,15Does he have a mullet?
JRP, needs more 303
D: He kicked his glasses off.
HOLD IT!
Yes he does :D
Swag.
KEYBOAAARD!4
After Friday BMN?
0,14Togusa's hair is too awesome to be called a mullet
Dem 4's
That was hot.
Togusa's hair is cyberhair
Canary isn't "ass butt" somewhat redundant?
ill mullets
that means the marathon will last ALLLLLLL NIGHT long?
05,15lol it's totally a mullet
I don't have a favorite episode because i'm an indecisive faggot. So what vote for.
lolkiwi
XAX: lesson zero :3
0,14SIR
0,14SIR
so.....I'll have to pull of an all night for season 3?
0,14THAT HAIR IS NOT A MULLET
His hair has cyberhair that dives into camouflage conditioner and all you can see of it is volume and shine
0,14YOU WILL TREAT IT WITH THE RESPECT IT IS DUE
13the letter is to the japanese government btw, we'll find that out next ep
What kind of up speed is needed for streaming? 100kb? 6Mb?
not a lot
Depends on what quality you expect.
05,15My hair is dangerously close to a mullet right now
Dear Japanese government, yer ma's a slag.
13depends on how much you want to do in addition
Love, Gendo.
I think 2Mb
i have a neckbeard at the moment.
0,14Someone once called my hair a mullet, I had to restrain the urge to send him to hell
13but then you cut your GLORIOUS LOCKS
100kb is enough for low-rate 360p. You'll need several megabits for 720 or 1080p.
XAX: same! High five! :P
13well, we stream at 640x480
so yeah All night MLP Marathon
13personally i use 350kbps video and 128kbps audio
SafariMonkey: *handslap*
0,14well, that incident was a year ago
My body is ready
at least bump it to S-Video (720x480)
0,14my hair has returned to its glorious length
hey shibaru
Shizuka >tfw upload speed is a total of 0.1mbsp
haven't seen you in ages
i hate my net
We have technology for 1/GPS internet WHY U NO USE IT
mbps*
13because free stream provider
yep I'm here
13it doesn't support anything higher very well
13500kbps video is about the most you can do
0,14holy crap, that's Kari's voice from Digimon
OH NOEZ
So many robot pinkies
dawnmew I see. I should be fine if I ever want to then. (50Mb down, 6Mb up)
Huh, It is.
I was talking bout home ips
Can't believe I even remember that.
13that tachikoma just pointed out photoshop
Tachikoma's can tell by the pixels.
SafariMonkey, where are you streaming?
prepare the nooks!
SafariMonkey Yeah, 6Mb/s is plenty, you can probably approach 1080p with that if you care to.
ok
http://www.speedtest.net/result/2289007871.png
I'm going to be taking a short leave of absence
We speedtest now?

Hello Josh
Sumica: So this is the ending to the series?
It had a confusing plot
00,10yep
New Tachikomas
Barbetos: Gurrrl that is so edgy~
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire - Part 1" airs in 4 days, 10 hours, 12 minutes, 13 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
Round the clock Cherry Blossom op
00,10there is a SAC movie
theres solid state society movie
So...what I missed?
So the best characters died and everything else is boned.
so the blue robot spiders are dead and get replaced with green pillbugs?
more or less
Would Solid State Society be A or B movie?
00,10Not sure
Probably B.
I saw the movie! It was GLORIOUS
Anime is really confusing
I somewhat doubt it sold that well.
It is A movie
Most likely B trying to be an A
00,10aye probably B, never got a US theratrical
I can't tell if my new driver is making a difference
It is AA+ movie
Well, that was confusing.
oh noes its over
know about what? me being gone for a little bit?
who is singing?
damn, feel sorry for eggman and that silver hair guy
00,10yoko kano
13ilaria graziano
Meanwhile: Must be the parts where you have to see all the episodes
Oh, she's singing in English... I think
Probably.
eggman was a douche
bag
other than trying to take over, what did eggman do?
The form of the music, I can't grasp it
yeah
Feels? Feels.

HoodyNinja: Not in this show, since it was only based on Zelda 1
Odd looking cartoon

Link and Zelda have the Triforce of WIsdom.

I can't wait to play Halo 4
I can wait

I can wait forever
DeadpoolDash: No, it's just black and silent
Nah we're just having a buffer show marathon
It's an avant garde video
so whos with the Lunar Rebuplic
probably too obscure for you
I know and its going to be awesome
thegt90: is nutral
nutral with a 357. magnum
No love for the .22
thegt90: im for united equstra to under the baner of the grate Luna
u really want to know what i like
AdamTheDuck: nuthing like a 44 magenum
thegt90: shuer
Lunar-geeky, nothing screams manlyness quite like going to war with a pink derringer. http://derpy.me/kv9Dn
AdamTheDuck: hell ya .... is that realy your gun or some pic you found
Lunar-geeky, lol nah, gun laws in Australia are very strict.
.44 Magnum is horrible for a combat cartridge
AdamTheDuck: ah
i really need to buy more guns
Engi: so it makes big boom and big whols in pepols face
hold on computer being stupid
It also has too much recoil, the bullet is too slow, and it doesn't work in pistols.
Well, most pistols.
The Automag and the Desert Eagle can use it
How about the golden desert eagle gun
Engi: im taling abut the gun 44 magmun the reover
oh
this is my favorite pony right here http://www.sgtjd.com/73Mustang/Mach%201%20Pictures%20Large/IMG_5503.JPG
Hehe, reminds me of the .50 ae M4 conversion kit.
Lunar-geeky: .44 Magnum is a cartridge. There is no firearm simply called "44 magmun"
.454 is used alot here
It's just screams: There's no kill quite like overkill
.454 Casull is purely for range queens.
Engi: realy dam well waht the name for the reolver that hulds it
we have have bears
DeadpoolDash: Then use a .45-70 or a .44 Magnum.
Watch as your IQ slowly burns from the madness .-. http://www.listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=AiRrYbte1GI
Lunar-geeky: There are thousands.
Engi: i like revoers
AdamTheDuck: You mean .50 Beowulf, right?
AdamTheDuck: what do you mean my IQ is ardy there
Can't remember >.< I was just surfing the net one boring afternoon
have you ever ran into an Alaskan brown bear? You need a large caliber side arm to even have a chance
Alaskan bull worm
DeadpoolDash: What did I *just* say?
05eye inflammation, sinus inflammation... when will it end...
Hello wrek
/me licks Wrek .-.
Ohai~
a 460 is nice since you can fire a 454 and a 45 colt out it as well
moo
Wrek, maybe an IQ burning video will cheer you up .-. http://www.listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=AiRrYbte1GI
...
.460 S&W.
yes
When you absolutely positively
have to punch a 3 inch hole into someone? .-.
both ends/
need to burn over a dollar every time you fire
I spend over a dollar on ever .308 round i fire anyway
every
.308 is also a rifle cartridge
It's arguably worth it
05.308 isnt very cheap :p
Yeah, at least a dollar/round

/me definately knows what Phase4 is talking about <_<
the computer in my shed has a wifi card and a prety sweet antenna
and my neighbours have poorly secured wifi
:3
You're an ass phase.
Oh wow Phase4 XD
bah, they're plan has no excess usage charges
and they never use it
like litteraly never
Still not cool >.>
i was checking for activity for over a month
at one point the printer... i think it printed something, hard to tell
XD
but yeah, afaik theres a printer on the network and thats it
/me "Do eeet Phase4, you don't know when you're going to get back your brandwidth"
Jmo, if they didnt want their wifi hacked they should have used wpa
Are they old folks?
Jmo, considering their usage patern of "they dont" thats quite likely
That'd explain it.
If you were cool, you'd let them know that their wifi is non-secure and help them with it :P
Jmo, not sure how though
Maybe they'll bake you cookies or something.
its not like they have computers on their network
Jmo, oh you :$
and remember i have a very good antenna
theres like 15 houses it could be
Just keep on stealing it.
It's not like anyone cares.

Hi everybody
Ohai The_Engineer
:)

Adamtheduck
AdamTheDuck: I have a question fo yo
I liek questions \:3/
Unless they're math questions
1+1!
then the multiple choice answers will be a, c, d and c respectively
and every other short answer question is 42.
/me nods once
AdamTheDuck: What time does Bro0nystate run in?
The_Engineer, umm...
I want to put it so I can come watch with everybody.
>.>
<.<
EDT I assume
EDT
the bot does UTC0...the place itself is very international-
?
I want to se it as my computer time
the mods span most of the time-zones
Set*
Is it USA?
The_Engineer, yeah I think
http://www.timeanddate.com/library/abbreviations/timezones/na/edt.html
uhh
is it just you guys in here?
+0*
/me doesn't know
I don't know what GMT
is
Tomorrow on Tuesday @ 7 PM EDT we have Left 4 De
Announcements are in EDT so I assume EDT.
The_Engineer, its the globally accepted '0'
in terms of time
What
Oh yeah that's true adam
...
The_Engineer, well your time zone will be a gmt offset
I don't understand GMT
GMT and UTC are the standards, computers usually use GMT as their standard in clocks in windows
What does GMT stand for and what does it mean
Greenwich mean time, I think
greenwich meen time
...
something like that
What the heck
Wasn't it meridian time?
if you open your windows clock, it should say your timezone in a gmt + -
or something
Gmt is weird for me
Oh there we go
UTC+04:00
No it's Mean, you are right.
Mine is UTC +04:00
Hello Everypony :D
UTC is about the same thing as GMT
Hello Allie
Ermagerd
Allie
they're different in ways that dont matter to the average person
ohai Allie
Were not ponies were bronies and humans.
EDT is GMT-4 and EST is GMT-5
Can't you just say everybody....
and AEST is GMT+10
+11 during daylight savings
So phase
Is my time correct?
uh....
not sure what you meen

Oh well, the hunt sent my on a nostalgia trip
Almost a million views .-. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u72aqP2_hxQ
At least I know the world isn't doomed to the type of music played on the radios nowadays.
Hehe
http://youtu.be/Gtl4oRYlRB8 this was one of my all time fav bands when I was a teenager, only 5k views ;__;
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9n0ui7xJd1rw70wfo1_500.png this was a unused portal file
Haha
oh, still, glad they didn't use it
funny that it was taped on though
Is that Japanese Vivix?
yeah
Despite never being an anime fan or things like that- I was, and still am I guess, veery into japanese music
Specifically this genre and the more grungy things-
When I think Japanese all that comes to mind is all those J-pop songs .-.
This song is very unexpected
for me anyway
ah yeah
yeah jpop is very--very pop
I was more into things like this
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9fhpgDqcE1rw70wfo1_500.png
many bands like it in the late 90s
hai everyone ^_^
Ohai OneTrickPony
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wEVfIj1vc like this, which I thought was a cool use of autotune, because even with autotune it sounds wrong
Hiya onetrick
and holy crap I have no idea what is happening throughout that music video :$
Hehe
o.o
What's with the robotic voice?
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9bgdvbodO1rw70wfo1_500.png <<<WHAT

Wish I knew what the lyrics translated to ;~;
Hehe yeah, I spent a lot of time reading translations those days
pumpkin head is more of a "just for fun" group though, so most of the times their lyrics made no sense
and INSANE engrish at times
Engrish is best enligh \:3/
hehehe

/me huggles Jmo \:3/
"Oh I just keep On Famous P.Man Be Like You I don't know Ward Peace."
oh my the last line: "So ren mey I'd way iron cade part death West run may soda way so lie"
wat :D
Engriish
Anyone's guess what that song is about, but hey, Jet sounded nice
Still not as bad as Nicki Minaj
Something more slow from Jet... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD1cxSE25ck
hehe
oh! This song I've heard
But damn... 6 years ago...
time flies
I'm only in my late teens... I feel old now ;~:
/me pats
You;ll feel older later ;)
One day you'll see band on stage younger than you
I was like "Oh, are they teenagers?" then they all had a sip of beer
I felt really old
Oh , and as you probably see now, there is a reason for the Disney-like music video.
Ah?
/me is at 3ish
and done, but yeah I liked the disney-esque
Wow, I didn't know Jet made that song :O

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmF7Rbe89fM only way to watch Yuru Yuri correctly :D
wow... currently browsing through "Woman Quotes xD" A woman is as old as she looks before breakfast.
:D
Lil_B: so Pinkie is still young because she's always hyper?
well... I think that doesn't mean what the quote was impülying xD
When thou goest to woman, take thy whip. - Nietzsche
Nietzsche, ugh
yeah, good ol Nitesche... reminds me, I need to check out Kant
Kant is better than Nietzsche, no ubermensch bullshit
The desire of a man for a woman is not directed at her because she is a human being, but because she is a woman. That she is a human being is of no concern to him.- Immanuel Kant, well basiclly wehat he's saying is "Man can love everything female, doesn't need to be human"
MadSurge Übermensch bullshit? never heard about that, but I'm actually not that teached about them
Alright, just got back from the polls, and I can say I have voted in a presidential election for the first time.
Lil_B: eh, some men are better than others and they should lead society :|
Did you vote for Vermin Supreme?
Jmo: what?
MadSurge oh :/

there is just 0 reasong for me to got there
brb
Lil_B: what about AMAs?
Hi CrazyCherry
:)
AMAs?
Ask me anything (AMA)
Though the guys from SA that made the Round Stable site are all nice people :)
never heard of it
Lil_B: it's the ex-Ponygoons
It's got a nice forum without any "kawaii" bullshit or blatant trolls
I'm not that much of a Forum Guy :/
Lil_B often someome, sometimes famous, will say what/who they are and Ask Me Anything
oh
I hear pings. O.O
Giana Sisters or Retro City Rampage?
/me flips coin
well, I guess it's time to drive on the Sidewalks again \m/
:D wut
MadSurge retro city Rampage, driving over Peasents, awesome xD

Good Morning.
Morning Tenderheart
:)
:3 SafariMonkey
:3
So how's it going Tenderheart?
Good, kids are off to school and I'm looking up were I vote for the upcomming election. Listening to some Tomestone, and sippping tea. ^u^
Ded chat? Hai everypony :3
Hello, and it appears so.
Nomnomnomnom
My school is showing a screening of Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 2
Which apparently is child-friendly
Well for thoses that like the series.. good.
heyheyhey
Spell-of-Gaming: my condolences
http://www.artige.no/bilde/42424
Ohh a link... *clicks*
:)
My god.
Sometimes I find my school iritating
Biker Mars From Mars.
Mice^
Spell-of-Gaming: sometimes?
How long it has been since I've watched that.
how about all the time
yay jaymoe!
I like the sketches at the bottom.
The last time I had my exams, we had to sequence on when the events happen
Sorry disconnect.
Tenderheart: who would win in a fight between those 3 guys?
No worries... WB
The Biker Mice?
no
between the eastwood and god and pulp fiction guy
Did you say something Tenderheart?
It's between Samuel and Morgan but I'm leaning towards Samuel since he wouldn't hesitate.
Just this if you missed it:
[08:50:04] Good, kids are off to school and I'm looking up were I vote for the upcomming election. Listening to some Tomestone, and sippping tea. ^u^
Tenderheart: morgan would probably win...you know...being god and all
Nice. :)
Kinda depends on the terms of the fight
Pretty sure God just wouldn;t get involved.
Tea, so are you British?
It's just not as o
* popular in many places
Tenderheart: yeah, but he is not just god, he's also morgan freeman.
artist: Hehe.. ture
artist: Love the pencil sketches. :)
Tea is pretty much stereotypical british-thing.
me tooooooooooo
Like Professor Layton.
Tenderheart: he's also drawn pewdiepie XD
artist: Saw that... :squee:
Spell-of-Gaming: humans.....
There's hundred of Vocaloid songs out there.
And literally a song with declaring war is popular
And people aren't aware of the meaning of the song.
Deaaaaaaad chat.
The masses interpretation is not allways concurrent with that of the artists.
I'm multitasking so replys are a tad slow
shhhhh Tenderheart i'm listening to music here :|
*smirks*
Tenderheart you *don't* consider yourself *a*typical?
OK guys I gotta go to the airport
Why?
See ya
careful out there
Have.. fun?
Oh I'm going back to britain
:)
Cool.
Yay!
... take me with you?
hehe
Tenderheart I would but I don't know where you live. :P
No wworries. I'll probably be over for BUCK next year.
Tenderheart why?
I have a number of friensd over there I need to meet and it's a perfect time to visit.
Tenderheart: :$ see you there then!
I mean it's not like there aren't cons over here
:3
TrotCon and Canterlot Gaurdens are in a 2 hours drive from my house so yeah I know.
Will be at Brony
..con 2013 as well.
OK bye
Bai!
*waves*
WE ARE THE CUTIE-MARK CRUSADERS!
so quiet here dammit!!!
On a quest to find out who we are
hello
Hi Dishwasher_EXTREME. :)
so disney maby buying out hasbro. good or bad. what do yall think?
......
No...
Just... No
:'(
consolidation, in general, not so great imo
but ponies in kingdom hearts guys!!!
If they leave it alone.. I'm okay with it.. but I doubt Disney will keep there little paws off.
.... okay... that would be cool... but still.
they more or lees left marvel things alone
+ deadpool 2 the game will have pinky pie in it >_> hopfully
The part worries me the most is Dinsney lawyers are WAY evil.
Lol
if they get Hasbro.. that will pretty much all but end BronyCons
i dont see y they would it wouldstop people from wanting to buy there products. if they cant see that they dont need to be in entertainment buisness
They are control freaks. Everything is controled and approved for the "Disney" image. Thing is the Brony image is not compatible with the Disney image I think.. there are parralels but Disney dosn;t Love and Tollerate.
Morning :3
Morning Ponies47
morning Ponies47
and generally, what Tenderheart said. Disney operates completely differently
hmm
G'day
Disney is a business. and they control every aspect of the IP's so they can control the outflow of products and thus the demand and prices for them
Hasbro is far more laxed
I don't understand all the worries about disney
^
disney makes great things
Yes they do but they tend to crush independant artists
ever heard of a great fan made disney thing?
also arguable: Hasbro straight up didn't expect, and doesn't have experience, controlling their IP like disney does
remember when they took marvel?
marvel makes so much money now
i wonder how much hasbro would be if they sold hmm
luscus was how much?
Fun fact: there were several fan-made pony apps on the Android app store for a while there. However, hasbro DMCA'd them shortly before Gameloft announced theirs
if Disney does acquire hasbro
hopefully their pony toys improve in quality
^
so while they're more likely to "leave well enough alone" for most of the fandom, they aren't completely letting the fandom run itself
Hello
Pixel Toxic and John are licensed by Hasbro.
The terms are not that bad from my talks with them
Perhaps, but I still don;t like it.
safe word is BANANA
lo lord
I prefer Kiwi
I thought the safe word was chloroform
rufies
... well that escalated quickly
lawl
... sorry
*smirk*
and btw
i thought wrek was baned for a month. not hating or anything, just that he was on some yesterday
banned from *streaming*
ahhh
I'm back!
welcome back Enigma
*lurks / AFK*
:O
So quiet
yes
yeah... unfortunately there's this thing called "work" I'm technically doing...
there's little bits of "waiting for computer to do something"
XD
O.O
Chat=DED
a stream would certainly change that
Ikr
/me Pokes the chat with a stick
/me wakes up drooling, wondering what's with all the poking.
/me dies from death of chat
so dat halo 4 came out....
That's a vidergaemz right?

u just killed 90 people dude. not cool
I heard that the crystal empire episode(s) are written by Meghan McCarthy. Sooo... I'm willing to bet that we'll have at least one mental breakdown.
The day SpeccyRush killed 90 people it was apparently not cool
for him it was Tuesday
Hey guys i saw the videos on youtube about 'chat reactions to (insert episode name here), so i decided to check it out on The Crystal empire episodes! :3
I know it isnt for another 4 days or so, but im so excited that im on here anyway!

sigh

I'm not the only one trying to get shit done before ponies start I take it... heh.
well there's work, and then there's work work
rainbowfan, welcome to Bronystate. Be sure to read the rules and enjoy your time here.
xles, maybe Meghan McCarthy should write an episode with a scene where a stallion loses his cool and makes it crystal clear that NICOLAS CAGE NEEDS TO VOICE THIS GUY!
hahaha
Hai everyone! :)
So, those politics.
/me imagines a Twilight "everything's fine" scene... then a stallion runs by yelling "I'M A VAMPAIYAH"

Whoa, @Jake, Ep1 of S2 is airing in Germany?
Rainbow: Whudda, dudda, HUH?
Hey Ameribronies, today's Election Day! If you're registered to vote and you're not disillusioned by the process, GO VOTE
If you are disillusioned, WRITE IN DERPY. Because a vote for Derpy is a vote for MUFFINS;.
Fuk dat im in africa
IFDreebs, that's just like voting independant
L
:D Vote for Derpy!
I can't be disillusioned in politics... one side is made by jerks who are in it for themselves (Italian politics, hooray)
Welp gotta run off to school now. And in honor of season 3 I'm wearing pony shirts to school for the rest of the week :3
Bye guys

Jakeryii: you bet your pants it will!
brb
yay!
My mom scheduled a freakin chimney sweep for nov 10 @ 10 am and the chimney is is the same room as the tv with the cable box...
And the whole world stands still for multicoloured small equines... :D
ello :)
Allo derp :D
Hi :3
Hayo
Chat must be slow this morning .-.
VERY slow
Hai derp :3
Hai
And no stream :(
I can't wait to see the chat explode once the season 3 episode comes on
that'll be hilarious
^
I saw the video showing their reactions to the royal wedding
the whole start of the video I was laughing
Will the site make the numbers of the horsie wedding? :D
I have no idea.
I expected the chat to be a bit less slow considering there's like, 20 people
Best moment was people freaking out over the end of the first part :D
unless they just stay up there even when they are offline
Actually yes they do
Ikr? everyone was like "OMG TWILIGHT IS DEAD"
the chat went crazy
Yeah, turnaround on ep1 of wedding was pretty sudden
suddenly zombies and hellfire
0,5Oh god
?
:O hi BaconMane!
0,5I remember that video
0,5Loved it
BaconMane: Ikr
yeah
Well at least we know there's one mod awake :D
0,5IM ALWAYS AWAKE
thank god mods are not asleep
...sometimes
0,5We always know >>
._.
they have informants everywhere
dayum
No stream yet?
Nope





Bwahh, I need to see RD's cutie mark story!
*losing hope of sr*









inb4 ban
gay
It's a home-run.



Wooo
Spam
i love spam
13oh good



gay

Lawl






But I like being gay. Being gay is better than being depressed
0,5Backup has arrived
Shizuka, just go and mute the channel
13should keep him out
0,5Hah
0,5He underestimates your power
I'm going to laugh if it fails.
0,5POWUH
Nuu I missed rainbow's story!
0,5ded
13hopefully it means everypony is out voting
05,15They all went out to vote
I didn't.
o_O
13GO DO IT
I hope they voted for Derpy.
05,15Like my history professor said this morning "If you don't vote, you forfit your right to bitch"
13^
:P
13if you don't vote, don't complain
I can complain actually
Since I'm only 16
13get off mah lawn then
And don't have control over anything in this election.
05,15you damn kids
05,15making all that racket
/me is watching the elections from across the pond
13i need it to warm up a little more before i head over, polling place is about a mile away across some dense streets
I'm quieter than most adults.
13CHANCE OF SNOW... NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
13do not want snow .-.
It's snowing here.
And don't be such a pansy.
13i live in minnesota
13once snow falls
13it won't leave until may
I live in WI.
13see?
13snow won't leave
05,15What if you run really really fast?
That's why you man up and just fucking go.
05,15Rev can you not be a dick please?
It's not like you have to wear your wet clothes all day.
13not snowing now silly
13but snow annoys me because albedo among other things
13photic sneeze reflex does not appreciate blinding white outside windows in the morning
I'm still going to complain about politicians
Also hi Shizuka and fluttercry :D
I vote, and still don't complain
I just found out recently that only every 3rd-5th person has photonic sneeze reflexes. I thought everyone did.
mainly because I have no idea what is going on in our politician world-
Photonic sneeze reflexes?
13bright light makes you sneeze
I don't have that
Rev: you look into the sun or at a bright light and sneeze.
13for me it's usually when i'm brushing out my hair, the tingling from pulling out knots coupled with the light tends to send me into sneezing fits .-.
Wait, there's that reflex too? O_o The human body is weird sometimes
13which is not fun when half awake
I can imagine- ee
I can't sneeze, properly, so I cough-sneeze instead, sometimes that hurts my throat
Sometimes my palate starts itching for no reason and I end up sneezing my lungs out
13the worst is when you know you're going to sneeze from bright light, so you kind of focus on it... and then you don't sneeze
13it just kind of hangs there taunting your nose
At least you don't have a cleft palate
13true that
Shizuka: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/1f47be399f9ccc6b136a7751b3a73c51.jpg Derpy knows your pain
13^
13so much that
Well, apparently I'm not going to school at all today
13it's like COME ON SNEEZE DAMMIT
your luungs hurt because you're preparing, so you sit there with your mouth open and eyes tearing
looking like a complete weirdo-
/me slaps Vivix
CRY.
I just hope that my mom doesn't get pissed at me for something I couldn't control
/me dies of tears
Sometimes I sneeze so powerfully my throat and nose start to hurt out of nowhere :|
I'm allergic to dust, and that makes me sneeze
Must be fun >_>
/me that's why i try to avoid the maid hour, except when i'm wearing a maid suit
:D
Last year we had so much snow, it was unprecendented. The roads were so devoid of cars/people you could hear the snow touching the ground! It was eerie
twoo years ago I think, it was so cold I got a brainfreeze while walking outside
snow on forehead and no hat
Hey everybody.
ohai #bronystate
hiya

*sigh* why is the chat so dead?
voting time for the muricans

well, the lowest I've seen was about 70 ppl
Doshwifreenblows
wut
u stank.
I bet most people here are lurkers
wut u want, aussie?
Oh
:>
okay den...
yup
when mlp comes on, we need to stream it. im booored.
It's on today?
aight im back i had to go watch mlp on tv over here sorry it took me so long though but yeah
if you are asking about S3, then it will be on saturday
There's a replay of a episode.
brony thank you fund ad? i missed soemthing, didnt i?
an*
Want ponies?
Yeah, 16:00, just need to stokc up on popcorn
Here's an idea
go to youtube...
Give dem ponays.
Dark_Horst: you did.
o u ashie-poo
so helpful
Alchemist: tell me more?
Alch, i'm saying later today an episode of mlp is gonna be on.
Dark_Horst: here is the ad with outtakes, background etc: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN-FM-j8FA0
rainbowfan: which replay of what episode?
Alchemist: so, basically a bunch of bronies said thanks. and that aired?
Dark_Horst: pretty much...yeah...
Its a charity ad, more than anything
foor toys for tots
Alchemist: how much did that cost?
Dark_Horst: dunno but it cost far less than the documentary
I think around 15 grand
documentary?
JdL
damn, i've been out of the loop
Dark_Horst: where have you been? :D http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/257527888/bronycon-the-documentary?ref=live
rainbowfan: no answer?
Dark: Party of One
Alchemist: happen to know when it will be done?
Dark_Horst: if you check the "updates" tab on the kickstarter link I think its there, im not sure.
k, back
Hey Everypony! :)
Hi, Dr. Nick
That made me laugh more than it should have
<3
well, cant be long now. they already had the prescreening
Yep. But I personally am not really interested in it.
Though it was jaw dropping to see the funds it got :D
i'll watch. if only becasue de lancie is in it xD
Same- I already know the things it explores, you know?
It could be interseting for outsiders to see though
Vivix: exactly
Hi
problem is, why would an outsider watch it?
Dunno- curiosity I guess
this isnt something that will be shown on history/discovery channel...
I guess it'll do okay for sales, because bronies who like JdL and friends- and a few outsiders
trekkies porbably
maybe some trekkies yeah
this is probably the most dead I've ever seen this channel ._.
Im not worried about the sales profit its gonna make.
Hi everypony
I would just wanna see how they want to portrai Bronys
Yeah, I dunno what happened to all the peopel that started turning up again
been a long time
I do am interested in that Lil_B
I'm very interested in the bronystudy though
Hey seatsea :)
Welcome back seatsea! :)
hoping next part of the survey comes soon
Alchemist well, it doesn't really need any, it got everything Via the Kickstarter
People just need to idle here all the time like I do, then it'd be fine. :P
Vivix: I thought that was completed already.
two or three part completed
Hai Lil_B !
but they will probably do one more on the darker side, since the previous was on the borderside and community control thing side
according to jdl, it will be respectful, insightful and very entertaining
hey Alchemist :)
sounds fun
Lil_B: that money they used to actually make the film, they didnt get profit from the kickstarter funds.
Dark_Horst: I do trust Q :D
Yeah, haha
Alchemist that I ment :)
but they won't loose money, so any made from sales would be an ok profit
I kind of started doing that, but sometimes I have to unplug my laptop :P
99.
101
MadSurge: of course
100
wat?
What are those numbers for
Heheh im so confused...
Umm... Chocolate milk. >_>
ohhh
i know what the numbers are
oh amount of users
yep
Resistance is futile
You will be assimilated in the herd
... if that's alright with you
Can you imagine something liker the Borg invading Equestria?
Thank God for desktops. :P
John delancie's words about the portrayal of bronies in the documentary: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGRdp9CcW0U from 29:30 to 32:00
pony_of_borg: porbably would get their asses handed over in two seconds
Can you imagine Pinkie Pie raising havoc on a Borg cube?
The borg or the Ponies?
Tervicz: The pink equine is completely illogical! Our systems fry trying to predict her actions!
I could see Fluttershy's stare forcing a drone to break is connection to the borg hive mind
The Borg might start puking rainbows....
And borg sheilds only defend from energy weapons, being bucked by a strong pair of hooves will be very effective
Hello everypony!
...I don't know who to vote...
why doesnt the federation go all projectile weapon on them?
that always bugged me
I always wonder that
would soleve so many problems
hi VenHur
you see picard using a machine gun only once on the borg, and that is in the holodeck
hey Dark_Horst, have you read that german brony article?
"we are the borg. lower your shields and prepa-" "TAAAANk MISSILE!"
Worf sticks to his trusty batlift
Invi: dont think i did
should i?
7me shrugs
Hmmm... They could have used them on that episode of DS9 where they defended that sensor station
Machine guns
(yeah, actually 7 mes >.>)
or nuke
s
Hammers?
I wonder if the Borg could adapt to Twilight's magic missle
probably not
"We are the Borg, you will be assi... -hey, you guys like bananas?"
so far it'S been esablished that magic is it's own for of energy
least i think
Bananas are irrelivant
Next thing you see the borg are stuffed with yellow fruit
Hey everypony, what are talking about today? :P
hi RaveBrony
i wonder if they could assimilate bananas
Borg vs Ponies
Borg?
O.o
borg
Hiya Invi :)
sounds swedish,d oesnt it?
from star trek
LOL
Hai RaveBrony :)
fun thing is, it actually does
Ah, lol. Im not familiar with star trek :D
is there no streaming?
Borg means fortress in swedish I think, does in Norwegian at least
indeed
Hey Spartan_Brovakiin, you get Halo 4? :D
Hey Thar Invi and RaveBrony !
Vivix: It does indeed.
hi Lil_B
Hey Lil_B :)
G'day :D
RaveBrony: Maybe >_> :d
Lil_B, have you been on EQD today?
Lmao
Hai HavokOC :)
I alwys thought that Borg sounds somewhat Scandinavian
Invi nope
Lil_B, well then behold that 1st ppst there ^^
*post
I assure you, scandinavians giggle at the mention of Borg every time. =P
Borg? sounds swedish is a line spoken in one of the Star Trek movies
I wonder why there's no Jedi in Star Trek :p
Hey Spartan_Brovakiin :D
Wrong Galaxy/ Universe LOL
(dat response time)
Tervicz: Because Jedi is in a galaxy far far away, a long time ago. duh.
Jedi Ponies?
Unicorns?
also, xles. I don't giggle at the mention of Borg
I rofl
Jedi in Disneyland....Soon :p
Would the Reble alliance symbol be there cutie mark?
Star Wars was already been in Disney Land since the 80s
HavokOC: Well fair enough then. I giggle. =P
:3
only now disney do nto have to pay royalties for it
Lil_B, what do you think? ^^
Smörgasbord means what in swedish? Because in Norwegian it sounds like butter goose table
there are no jedi in star trek because jedi are fantasy cast
star trek is scie fi
Vivix: Smörgåsbord, literally Sandwich table.
Invi "Wenn Männer rosa Ponys lieben" "Der Düsseldorfer ist Fan der Serie "Mein kleines Pony" ... Thats insulting to me as a guy who likes the show and a guy who liky grammar and the coherent use of one language within an article
Aah
lol
ja
whats with people and trying to translate names and titles all the time?
Min lille ponniii min lille ponni æææ æææ æææ æææ
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
well, stupid people have to understand the name of the show Dark_Horst ^^
Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology
Dark_Horst yeah not even the show does it, and the german name for Pony is not Pony xD (well... one might argue that nowerdays -.-)
Dark_Horst: you dont want to know how the mane 6's names sound like in hungarian...
Its not that Jedi is fantasy and Star Trek is Sci fi
What is it in german anyway? Something along the lines of Esel or something IIRC?
i imagine htta to be mildly entertaining xD
Invi "Der Brony weiß, wie es ist, auf sein Hobby angesprochen zu werden." well, I ose 2 times in school wearing my Rainbow Dash Shirt, and I didn't gfot a single Question or weird looks :/
Esel is donkey I think Eselhengste
xles: no. thats a donkey
Trek tries to make everything sounds plauseible with terminology and star wars is like becuase we can
heyo guys
Hai Eli :)
Donkey, pony, small horselike creature...
Probbily in Equestria Thamagurgy is a reconized area of science
Lil_B i think they mean cosplay ^^
Pony is ponni in norwegian, not sure where the word pony originated
thing is, everybody nowadays says pony too
Invi nope, the picture just showes a normal guy, and no mention of cosplay whatsoever
with slightly different pronkuncation
Lil_B, actually pony is a german term
Pony in swedish is Ponny...
oh okay then /me shrugs
pony = horse horse != pony
xles: funny, that'S how we say it xD
Dark_Horst: ever heard a german say it? it sounds soo stupid in german...
yeah... now it's a german word...
/me checks etymylogy
written Prony, spoken Ponni
Eli: i am german B)
written Pony*
mid 17th century: probably from French poulenet 'small foal', diminutive of poulain, from late Latin pullanus, from Latin pullus 'young animal'
However, for some reason, when I talk about mlp ponies I always type it as poni...
Well English is a germaic lanuage so it is understabable some words have carried over
Dark_Horst: well it does sound stupid. :P
Lil_B, '' In Deutschland gibt es nicht nur die Unterscheidung zwischen Pony und Großpferd, wie international üblich, sondern zusätzlich auch noch die zwischen Pony und Kleinpferd.'' -Wikipedia
pony is french origin
Eli: works both ways^^
thing witih pony is that it's a height and build classification, so not all countries have it natively
languages*
Invi well, I like Wiki for sources of Knowledge, but not as a source of Grammar and Rechtschreibung :P
lol
Dark_Horst: what do you mean?
french for pony is poney
yeah
the english origin is probably poulenet
Eli: imagine that the english pronouncation sounds just as different to us
Lil_B, ''Pony
Incidentally poney is also gump for pony.
my little pony in frnech would be mon petit poney
Invi noo! I will barricade behind my wall of disbelieve
:D
Forest Gump ran and ran, and gave a poney to his beloved jenney. #truestory
speaking of mlp and languages, have you guys seen the polish "find a pet" song? its awesome!
sadly no
Invi "Deutsches Reitpony" "Ponyzüchtung" I surrender -.-
Pondoo
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
Hehe
^^
I was working on a story where Discord and Q was the same being, the same person if you will
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1OQ6p9dsG4
informal a small glass or measure of alcohol:
a pony of vodka
wat
Dark_Horst: i feel flattered that you think i'm english, but i'm swiss. i still think it sounds dumb in german (swiss german just as well)
pawnduh ^^
the more you know
" meist zwischen 16 und 34 und heterosexuell" I don't care if the writer of this Article was pro, contra or neutral, or if I'm a pazifist or not, I wanna Strangle him now
hiya Invi ^^
pony_of_borg: i am :P
/me huggles Panda !
LOL
Hai Panda :)
Oi Pondoo
Ei Grüß Gott Eli!
xles: shit, blew my cover
/me huggles Lil_B
Jmo yeah?
I would be confused for a ape if I ever go to Equestria so why not
why would that need to be written n an article=
Lil_B, xD well they try to wipe out stereotypes ^^ but it gets better ^^
"I hungry." "I hungry." "Stop" "I hungry."
Lil_B: what are you copypastaing in here? article about bronies?
Eli: Well... That would explain your lack of punctuation... *whistle*
Jmo ^^ danke
or a really odd looking shaved Diamond dog
Eli: yep
Eli yeah, the linked artikle on EQD
Eli stuff like that really gets me raging >: ( and I watched enough Internet Critics to know how to rage properly xD
xles: nope. my lack of punctuation is just because i'm stupid :P
/me huggies dat pawnduh ^^
I am just lazy
Eli: Good as reason as any. ^^
and its the internet
Lil_B: if they say "mostly 16-34 hetero" is that bad?
lazy excuse is better than internet excuse
Eli nop, but I kinda don't like that this is what his description starts with
Lil_B, german Discord 1 is out :D
You know. I think I'm gonna' go check the VA panels from EQLA.
so much germany ^^
I it me or from the websites graphic banner, Rainbow Dash is broed with what ever film they are watching
Invi yeah, finally wanna hear John De Lances new Voice Actor
me too...
Lil_B, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QMHmipjkrc
and aparrently: Dragoneequus = Drachenpony (= translated dragon pony)
Lil_B: what happened to the old one?
Dark_Horst the Voice of him who did Q for example died in 2009
well, crap
Lil_B: nothing against homosexuality, but if they started to say bronies can be hetero too (in the news opinion, didn't use to be like this) i have nothing against it.
german discord doesnt sound that bad.
pony_of_borg: RD only likes action movies :D
a bit infantile maybe
I imagining they are watching some animated film
Meep
Eli I don't really care at all for the mentioning of the sexualitys, I just hate that he felt like this was the thing to start of the description...
Like their version of a Disney movie, and they probily just got to one of the many musical numbers
i know that voice
damn. where did i hear him before
I think it is why Pinkie and FLuttershy seems to excited
Lil_B: ok. well, could be worse. have you seen College humor's opinion on bronies?
shh don't spoiler me Dark_Horst ^^
They have opinions?
Vivix: nope. they just copy/paste fox news
Hehe
Eli heard about it, I ingopre Stuff like this, both to avoid Haters and to avoid Bronys who act liked angared Wasps
I think I saw their animated skit
I don't look at outsiders opnions of stuff I like. I don't need others to validate my own opinions
I didn't think it was bad, not super funny, but--just a joke
well, wherever he was in... that doesnt really fit discord
probably, they are a site about humor after all, but I honestly don't enjoy their other Stuff ether
Same
I did like their skyrim hoarding thing, but--that's it lately
if..that was them
well you shouldnt enjoy ether that much anyways, its bad for you in the long run :D
Vivix: who are we talking about?
College Humour
hey guys
ah
Hiya alexxm
hi alexxm !
Hai alexxm :)
how are things Vivix Alchemist and Spartan_Brovakiin
Lil_B: same
S'good here, yourself?
pretty good thanks
i'mm good Vivix is there a stream
noot as far as I know
I think most of the mods are out starting their day
Lil_B: when planking was popular, i would have liked to kick them in the balls for their vid. 5secfilms did good tho
Eli: hell yeah they did :D
Alchemist: NO!
LOL Discord has the Voice Actor oif German Patchy the Pirate from Spongebob Squarepants xD
08,01it's 6pm for me
Dark_Horst is Discords VA the same VA like that parrot of Alladin?
08,01i only woke up about an hour ago
7 here
You completely missed the sun!
08,01Invi: Discord's VA is Q from Star Trek
his Voice isn't bad, but I unfortunetly have not his other roles in the back of my head xD
6pm, only woke up an hour ago, wat
Invi german voice of Q
Lil_B, it is?
08,01oh
Originally the studio was going to use someone that sounded like Q, but they found out they could get John DeLancie who actually played Q was a better choice
08,01i was just talking about JdL to the head of Galacon
whats JdL?
John deLancie
oh
Lil_B: your comments are getting kinda blurry... do you get enough sleep?
Eli yes, I always type derpy actually :) it's 7pm too xD
good evening
Lil_B: i know :P some 100 km south, remember?
hi Diamond_Tiara_2012
Eli yes, I know xD
Hai Diamond_Tiara_2012 :)
this is so wrong :D http://i.imgur.com/lBdDC.jpg
hi Diamond_Tiara_2012 and Spartan_Brovakiin
Alchemist I don't know, shall I laugh or cry?
so is the newsletter out?
by the way...........what movies are we watching this weekend?
Alchemist thats wrong
Lil_B: I think the absurdity mkaes it hilarious
alexxm I checked about 30 min ago, I didn't get it

ermagerd Perrny advertscerlender
I saw a really nice official one on ebay, german and scandinavian text
hexagon shape
Vivix hhmmm I could ask how much shipping for a calender would cost xD
Advent Calender again yay!
so Lil_B is there chocolate or ponies in?
08,01urgh, advent calendars...
Chocolate Ponies?
http://www.ebay.com/itm/German-G4-FIM-Advent-Calendar-My-Little-Pony-European-Blind-Bag-Mein-kleines-/140879344664?pt=TV_Movie_Character_Toys_US&hash=item20cd103418
meh. Epiphany > Advent
woops longling
:c
Invi probably Chockolate http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GyJQYQnDuwk/UJji0OC6NzI/AAAAAAABA0E/Yi53_hbQ_nk/s1600/2.JPG
i like ponys
the ebay one has chocolate and ponies I think, I can see twilight at least
fuchs?
choclate... foirget it, it's Schokolade
PONYBASTARD: you dont say?!
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/11/rumor-discussion-disney-looking-to-buy.html
Lil_B, how much does it cost?
/me this wont last long
you gotta be shitting me
i love trains
Invi no Idea, I'l check Lidl
Dark_Horst: slowpoke.jpg
Dark_Horst awesome isn't it= xD
We'll see what happens;
well, it would certainly raise the chance for a movie
Dark_Horst: seems news travel slower nowdays around you :D
then again, disney doeas not like their stuff on youtube
yeah
havent checked eqd during the weekend
Hasbro as licensor and Hub as network is better than disney and disney channel
actually, i barely check it at all lately
Dark_Horst: well people always find a way to upload stuff.
Lil_B, theytranslated fabulosity with fabelhaftigkeit xD
At last there might be a movie
nooo- at least 3 more seasons before movie pls
Invi well... I tcould be worse... I guess...
I'd prefer that the movie will be the last they do.
get us a few more seasons before that
indeed
needs more seasons in4 a movie
same
a movie would just be terrifying at this point
Ja, ich hast flow.
oh god I'm butchering the language
Lil_B: what? german discord?
well the storyboard artists do not write the movie
ja deutsch Discord
SpeccyRush yes :/ spoke it as stiff as a stick
a movie would probably be well produced, but- what if different studio is needed due to time constraints? Who would write it?
it's too early, in my opinion
Lil_B: which line
man the mini grab bag of Princess cadance looks weird, its a repaint of Celestia
I wonder if older gen villians will ever appear...
Is there a Stream?
so is the one of Luna, dont see me complainin' :P
I agree we need more Tirek and Gogrog
maybe the shoomze
:D smooze
yeah that
i want smooze ^^
Hey what happen to the talks of making Dr Whooves a canon caracter in MLP?
Could be interesting, who knows
I saw eh..
can't remember who, but someone drew ..g1 princess I think in G4 style
goorgeous pony-
hasbro once had talsk with the BBC about it
pony_of_borg: he's apparently named Dr. Hooves. Lawyers said they could get away with that much, but Whooves would be too much
last I remember hearing...
SpeccyRush when Discord talks to Rainbow Dash in the Labyrinth before he hypnotizes her
Invi searched for Pony on the Lidl Site, but I couldn't find anything... exept Sony
lol
nobody home?
Well I heard his name might be cahnged to Time Tunner
SpeccyRush thje one for Luna?
Lil_B: which one what now?, I can't remember what I said
nuuuuuuuuu :c
Won't be able to watch the season premiere untill it gets out on youtube or something like that D:
I'm moving when it streams here
:(
why so streamless today?
just noticed
oh look, a tumbleweed
suddenly, irc pops spam
Dark_Horst, you also got spammed? >.<
SpeccyRush [19:10:38] <SpeccyRush> so is the one of Luna, dont see me complainin' :P
Gots to love dem kickbots.
hello everyotter
G1 Galaxy with G1 Majesty's colour scheme-
>.>
spammed?
Yup
server slow, and i got spam kicked
dont thinkso
Invi I just found out something about the german BBBFF Song xD
hmm
Lil_B, what? ^^
but my chat didnt do anything and then jumped downwardfs
I thought Dr Hooves was named Time Turner?
appearatnly it lagged
Lil_B: ah yes well what i was saying is the mini blindbag of luna is just a recolour of celestia too just like the cadance one is in response to borg pony guy
SpeccyRush oh, sorry than :(
It just dropped like over 30 messages in about 5 seconds
Vivix, thats that the trading cards ended up calling him
Okay, cause I kinda like that name
wat http://derpiboo.ru/144484
Invi well, in german it's GBUBF , which sounds amazingly Dorky if you say it xD
but I really wonder if that pony have a tardis or not
Lil_B, ikr? xD
Invi "Er ist mein GBUBF!" I love it xD
GBUBF sounds like a secret weapon's codename
maybe it will read Pony Box instead of Police box
lol
So seems season 4 just got confirmed
Hello.
not to 100%
hi TVNOOD
Allo TVNOOD
mitamaking got a link?
Hai TVNOOD
No stream right now?
basically we will have a "normal length" S3, just in two pieces?
woo s4
not really, I think
Alchemist, we will?
I think 13 episodes is because of DHX contracts and some time constraints
pony_of_borg: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/11/possible-season-4-official-confirmation.html
Invi: well, I guess S4 would also be 13 eps
but next season was said to be full length, according to..Andrew something
no, they saidn ext is full length a long time ago
but that means s4 wont be until fall 2013
nooo
Vivix: I missed that. disregard what I said then.
Could the movie be this summer then?
I can't remember who it was, but I think it was the bgm guy who wrote a blog about why 13 episodes and what is up for the next seasons
no, there's no movie being worked on I think
Lil_B, at least she doesn't use GBUBF in the song ^^
I think DHX bought a studio, and had to complete some contracts that wouldn't allow them to do 25 episodes- but don't quote me on that
I think a movie is a foregone conclusion
only 13 episodes, a half season. I think they are pacing them selves for something
Vivix: bgm guy? william anderson?
yeees
he als osaid "Seasons" on purpose he said
so- s5 is possible
Invi well, nor does "BBBFF" gets used in the BBBFF song :) only the whole words
6 seasons and a movie
I doubt there's a movie coming noow, but maybe near the end of the run
trrrrru ^^
that sounds good
You know G3 MLP never went out of production
I think I heard that
Only time will tell what is going on, but that's my understanding of it-
I mean six seasons and a movie would be great. Not too short, not too long, just about right.
I'm secretly hoping for eight, but- six sounds good to me
depends on how many ideas they have Alchemist
PPG, Foster's, KND, a few more I forget, are all 6 seasons and a movie
okay so
?
Fister's is six?
damn- I need to get those
I only saw 2
what part of Lauren faust has nothing to do with MLP FIM now
she doesnt write for them anymore
Invi: I think six seasons would still be good if only 3/4 of it is based on good ideas
hm true
Who cares about faust, it's all about wooty and thiessen
I nopice with MLP FiM they are willing to adpot some fan ideas and fan fics for ideas for show plots
not fanfics
trust me, writers never read fan works
The only reason Derpy showed up so much because the fan base loves her
it can get them into shit-tons of legal trouble, simpsons trash fanscripts on receival
I also thought they aren't encouraged to look into fanfics
Vivix, how do you know?
oh okay
they cant. of they had idas in the show that stemmed from fanfics, they could get sued
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_md2v0ie2HG1r3xauuo1_1280.png
11,01I don't even think Faust is involved with MLP anymore.
if they read something and use an idea, they can get sued
Actually the 7th book of Harry Potter is based on fan fics
Nittany_Discord: she isnt
Faust hasn't been involved since season 1
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/6/19/iQSxUQ5pxU6YoA9wKSydrA2.png
Nittany_Discord: also hello Aniki how are you today?
Faust did a great dev work though
Faust isn't part of the regular crew any more but she still works as a consultant
11,01Good Bronysith.
I don't think she consults anymore either
since faust left the show has been going down in quality slowly
samurai jack is only 4 seasons I think, Dexter's lab is even less, but Im not sure.
I totally disagree Bronysith, but we know you don't care about our opinions
Alchemist: samurai jack had nothing to do with faust
I think Dexter went on too long
He husban is working on she show, Faust still has some influence
Vivix: i never said that
Bronysith: I never said it did...
And Samurai Jack needs more
her*
I think the show has increased in quality greatly since s1, and I thank thiessen and the other leaders of the show
Nittany_Discord depends, if she's off the credits than yes, if she still is... whats the name... consultive Producer than she might still has some influences in some minor design or Story things
Sorry Bronysith, but last time you kinda sounded like it. I shouldn't assume though
Vivix: i never said i dont care for peoples opinions
im not my moronic father =_=
I don't think she's involved at all anymore Lil_B, I think Thiessen and wooty took over all her responsibilities
Sorry Sith- you never said it, but-- yeah, assuming is bad, so sorry
Imagine Luna using the tradtional royal canter to yell out loud as she can, "Crytalist's mother was a stinkbug"
and you here a distant ARRRGGGGG being screamed
Vivix yeah, but thats the kind of thing where I really wanna see some kind of official statment that at least hgints atr it, but yeah, even for S2 she was only helping in the first 3 eps
She was involved at all? I thouht she stopped consulting iiin mid s1
Lil_B you're drunk go to bed
Lauren might be involved unoffically as well
they made the show what it is from the great development Faust did in S1
Nah, she didn't know anything bout the season closure for instance
as in other people boucing ideas off of her
Vivix no, she said it herself, I think it was at Bronycon, could be wrong on the location thoug, but I know for she sure that she said it
Okay, I haven't looked into it, but yeah she did consult for a while
SpeccyRush I don't even drink Alcohol, nort do I take drugs or smoke

I can't move I'm stuck in ice
13IN OTHER NEWS

instead, we should talk about season 3?
not allowed. spoilers are forbidden
CRYSTAL PONIES ARE MADE OUT OF CRYSTAL
SPOILER BROKEN
HEY LOOK A MOOSE!
I know spoilers are forbidden, but surely there is a difference between speculation and spoilers
We shouldn't discuss either, especially if speculation is based on spoilers-
true dat
up until a few weeks ago I didn't even know episodename- ;___;
Alright spoiling times.Trixie is coming back in S3......that bitch needs to die already
and i almost achieved my goal.
Hey
The_Engineer
Yes
How about no?
kthnx
my goal to avoid all spoilers people throw at me.
13protip, read the channel topic
The_Engineer: asshole
13s3 spoilers means ban
But but trixie is worst pony
But everyone already knows
Your opinion.
Not to me she's not
and till now it worked pretty good
Good for you The_Engineer.
The_Engineer Welp enjoy your incoming ban
Yeah, it's getting harder though
I mean even EQD is something I avoid in fear of episode names or pictures now-
one post said "We all know now that'''' is returning"
i even avoid pony talks with friends
and was like "WHAT!?"
Vivix Seth has a massive crush on trixie
....
thats why he posted that
thanks vivix
I know, but that post wasn't about Trixie
I won't say who it was about
05,15Silly Shizuka you know nobody reads the topic
05,15...or reads at all
Or can read at all
13yeah but it's the same thing we did at goon haven
im thankfull you cencored the spoiler part
I do :/
13having it there means people have no excuse :)
Okay, i'm back and- *sees Barneystate comments* KHAAAAAAAAN! KHAAAAAAAAN!

Lil_B: ikr?
suddenly, german chat
dutch have it easy. I believe it takes almost no effort for them to learn english and german. Half of the vocabulary is already there.
:P
08,01Alchemist: actually, German is like Hard-Mode Dutch
dutch looks interesting-
08,01Snow: seer leuk
Heldige de ja
Vivix: its one of the most hardest languages to learn
well... if that would be true, than Dutch is appearently too easy for me to understand xD
I should learn a second language...
I mean third
yeah, but like with Norwegian, some dutch looks almost similar, but used differenlty
it looks bizarre
Alchemist: ga nederlands leren!
like taternorsk
Snow: I think russian/french/german would be more useful
uh
Ouch, everyone. I have returned, with pain.
Hello Guys :)
Hiya
hi Kencolt and sonicdude558 !
Hi, sonicdude558. :)
hello everypony:)
Alchemist: everyone in germany knows english, so thats out of the question.
dont need that there anymore.
Hi, Etharian. :)
when wrek gets back on air he should stream a german episode of ds9
Monday, it all happened. I had every tooth in my head ripped out (and there was much blood) and am not wearing "training" dentures that are irritating and somewhat wobbly.
that might have interesting chst reactions
finally got a normal Music Project to work on again, A Waltz version of This day Aria, siddenly came to my mind, I always wanted to make a Waltz
dutch is fun to know
hi again. My web browser derpd. 6_9
especially when people from forgein language try to pronounce duth sentences
the accents
they make me laugh
maybe, but I dont want to invest at least 2 years to know a fun language if Its not practical for me.
Snow flem everywhere?
the stream is broke
Vivix: uhmmmm....Flem?
you're right
is the stream broke for everypony else?
like--chh noise?
yomeone fix it
Snow: spit
stream stuff!
also that
gtg I'll be back alter :3
I notice a lot of people overdo it insanely when learning languages
but brittish people for example
Snow: I mean flem=spit
that sounds hilarious
Vivix: what do you mean, overdo?
and no, we only "flem"on the letter P
like instead of a mild ch noise, they like hack their throat and choke on the noise
/me feels weird
you know, like a parody
its just the accents that make it funny
I just wanted to swing by and say hello, so now I'm leaving BYE.;)
thats all.
ah, know what you mean
BYe, Etharian. :)
lol hello and goodbye Etharian
Bye Etharian
to be fair though, getting the th right isnt that easy either^^
like, try to make a brittish guy speak german for example
If I could choose freely i would study polish. russian sounds too barbaric for me.
Yeah, I've had fun listening to british try to speak Norwegian
jaai heeh tuuhr
Though russian might prove useful if I wanted to intimidate someone ina dark alley.

I think its a screamer
I am not very sure
Nope
Because Monday I had every tooth ripped out of my6 head to make room for my new dentures that don't quite fit right yet and until the sutures heal I can't have anyof that in my mouth.
and no its not a screamer
never got past those damn stairs
stairs
odd, the stairs were farily easy for me

twilight_sprinkle: so a game about pressing buttons to try and walk has a story/ending

Kencolt: well at least dentures means no cavitys

:kickcount Dark_Horst
Dark_Horst: Dark_Horst has been kicked 0 times
lol
that cant be right^^
MadSurge whats terrifying is its been seen in several states
and the staff wont do anything about it
pfff
Pffff
It's Bush jr all over again
Interestingly enough, certain machines in early voting districts were shufling Romney votes to Obama. Seems less sabotage and more machine failure.
well good night everypony bed time for me
who knows...
Night, Mistress_Rainbowdash. :)
Gnight Mistress_Rainbowdash
goodnight Mistress_Rainbowdash :)
00,10so is the stream even working or no?
Kencolt: yeah, faulty computers seem the case
They're having the problem all over the place, on both sides.
its working
^
There's some machines apparently changing Obama votes to Romney ones.
it works!
Works for me
And vice versa.
Hi all
yes Sumica
Hi, JRP. :)
hoi JRP
ohai JRP!
Which just goes to show, why would you trust a machine to count votes anyways?
and yeah those machines are just glitchy im thinking, itd be stupid to make the cheating that obvious if they really intented it
CriticKitten: we still trust people doing it in fact
Holla everypony! :)
Hi, GilDash. :)
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/6334460982a724ddac0a80e15011f117.jpg :O 'tis so epic
I like this girl
Hello GilDash!
ohai GilDash!
MadSurge: I don't trust people much more than the machines. There's been some serious funny business with the primaries, too.
It won't stop raining. I guess I'll stay home today.
MadSurge: zelda + MLP? great :D
Like one district which reported zero votes for Ron Paul, despite at least two large families professing to have voted for him.
CriticKitten: maybe one person, but multiple people? Naaah
Oh you better count on it.
http://i.imgur.com/Rp0Fg.jpg
maybe he is legion.
okay, this is where it gets bullshit
We're just a few steps away from blatant ballot box stuffing.
magic? fine. no arguing with that
but a wire net?
no
A few very small steps.
Foo fighters has best concert
00,10Dont need magic to kick his ass

here anyone can set up a part so long as the pay the $300 to the electoral comission and they get into parliment if they get either a electorate seat or 5% of the vote
Why Pirate Party has my vote
I liked that filibuster thing Bernie Sanders did.
11,01The US needs a couple of Pirate Party seats in the house. Keeps the copyright monopoly in check.

Lunar_Brony: ....
Lunar_Brony: My point is what again?
Thanks for DA watch Nittany_Discord, I watched you back ^^
11,01You're welcome Ponies47.
You see, I give no shit towards politics, but it made a reference to Coke and Pepsi tasting similar.
so I went straight towards the Coke and Pepsi ref
kk?
05,15I belive there isn't a stream on at the moment
Lunar_Brony: Your point...?
05,15Pepsi is clearly superior
I was making a point?
no it isn't fluttercry, Coca-Cola is
Lunar_Brony: Speaking...-> Point there
coke and pepsi taste the same
05,15Pepsi is sweeter
its pretty much fact that Coke is better.
that's one reason why I'm not a big fan of Pepsi.
and it has a milder taste IMO
especially from plastic bottles
08,01pepsi is vile deathdrink
08,01coke is not much better
08,01everyone knows that the true fizzy drink is Irn Bru
|Dr Pepper beats both Coke and Pepsi
I secretly feel that way about alcohol in general
I personally don't see the difference between coke an pepsi
08,01Lunar_Brony: that's because it's scottish
*and
Funny. Despite the fact I like both Pepsi and Cola (Cola wins for me) I also refer to them as "liquid death". XD
Well that answered that
I like Dr Pepper J_E_Smith71, but it has a unique taste. I'm comparing Colas, see
08,01scotland is one of the only countries in the world where there is a more popular soft drink than coke
08,01that's what irn bru is
08,01no-one in scotland drinks coke
but the superior soft drink is Mountain Dew Gamer Fuel
08,01everyone drinks irn brew
Irn-Bru is fucking lovely.
I want that stuff.
08,01Buytoast: sorry, irn bru beats the dew
And orange.
especially when washing down some Nacho "Master Cheese" Doritoes
But especially lovely.
don't forget to buy Halo 4
08,01see, GilDash knows what i mean
One day, I will fly to Scotland and drink Irn Bru
08,01GilDash is a cool guy
05,15Doritos and Mtn.Dew teamed up with Halo 4 to bribe Geoff Keighly
sounds 'bout right
I also like Dandelion & Burdock, but that's the Yorkish in me.
he could've at least sold out for something tastier
like cheese popcorn
OOH FOR FUCK SAKE
05,15http://images.eurogamer.net/2012/articles//a/1/5/2/2/9/2/6/lh18_1.png/EG11/resize/600x-1

yep. shame he died from moon poisoning. why luna, why!?
Done & Done :)
I really really really wanted to write in Derpy Hooves on my ballot because I hate both candidates, but I ended up voting for Romney just because I have to live with my parents and they would never let me hear the end of it if I voted against Romney
i feel your pain Midnight_Fyre
Midnight_Fyre: You can *lie* to them, you know. I voted against my father, but I lied to him about it.
Not if there's a voting receipt
08,01hehehehe
I'm a horrible liar. I wouln't have gotten away with it
08,01i was just on to tech support for Rackspace
Im going to relax the best I can tonight - got my favorite food - Enchiladas Verdes from my fav restaurant & my traditional whiskey stein - if that don't settle my nerves, nothing will
08,01and the guy was a brony
Doesn't matter anyway because my vote doesn't matter
08,01and so was his manager
:O
that's awesome
08,01told him to come on here on saturday to watch the new series with us
Well, next general election I'll be casting an "interesting" vote. XD
Cypresswolf: nice
08,01sonicdude558: i'm dead serious
Steam is working for me, Nittany_Discord
/me 08,01is setting up new load balacning systems for saturday

Steam is back
Hopefully one of these thousands of papers will work so I can register
it is?
GilDash: By the next election I'll be moved out and I intend to vote for whichever fictional character I damn well want to
poop
not here
yes
ya cuz all i get is captian buffer
for me at least.
then why the hell am I still offline?
all I see is that dreaded buffer wheel *gets dizzy watching wheel* O_o
And why the hell am I AFK?
VOTE FOR TWILIGHT SPARKLE
Midnight_Fyre: Oh, I'm not voting for anyone. I'm going to write something to the effect of, "You're all the same anyway; why bother?" Perhaps not as nicely put though. XD
Good thinking
if they don't then too bad, I'm not going back there again
Fun fact: Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse get thousands of write-in votes every presidential election
"Dear Congress: you can go fuck youselves! Sincerely . . . ME!"
Lunar_Brony|AFK: well, past you went looking for you and told us if you got back before you returned to keep you here
Today is also my birthday. My parents bought me sushi for dinner. It's yummy
I end up mocking the accent of the person I'm talking to.
Happy B-Day. :)
Thanks Time
/me agreed to take a 24 hour shift, in exchange for booze
Midnight_Fyre: happy b-day! just becareful of the fish parasites that eat you fomr the inside, ok!? :)
after all this time, I have finally got ***suits out of my head.
Midnight_Fyre: i love specialty sushi
Cypresswolf really? Well, if you see my past self, tell him to get the fuck up and do some baking. Then I wouldn't have to.
StuffCrusader: Thanks ;)
my cat just crawled al over my keyboard, and is now in my face....
/me slaps Bronysith around a bit with a large trout
Lunar_Brony|AFK: Will do :)
But the universe doesn't work like that, so I'm going to have to do the baking -__-

Cany cane text
*Candy
is that double talk for stupid?
Oi. /
im in the army, and i dont want mitt as my commander
man, i'm not really very politacal at all. all i want is a dude that won't screw of nation over.
a rich white man, who abuses money, with his own army.
i dont like that.
05,15I saw a graph earlier that showed international views on the candidates and it was a shit load of Obama and like...no Romney
Oven Mitt Romney
Lyra Mitt Romney?
nope
he just doesnt seem like a trustworthy man
also, his wife is annoying
fluttercry: Pretty much the only country outside the US that supports Romney is Israel, and that's because he'd back a war with Iran
:D
so... how was everyone's day? :l
daris posting bs again
Romney has very far-right views that he initially expressed, but has suppressed saying them for the purpose of gaining more voters. Essentially, he's saying what he believes he needs to to win. Barack generally keeps along the same line as before, making him seem much more trustworthy. The UK right now is getting good at spotting political BS with all that has happened in the coalition government right now.
Sorry for the text wall.
lets stop with this plz =_=

Politics :|
if i hear anymore political bullshit in here

politics is bullshit

either vote for retard A or retard B
OMG
or do what i did and write in Molestia
11,01Lol Bronysith.
11,01I voted for a real candidate.
im playin story of the blanks right now. WTF is this
Bronysith: Right now the country's in big mess, so it's you job to pick the guy who will screw up...less
J_E_Smith71: either way we lose
one way we lose slower than the other
I should have worn a black beret; scare some white folks.
Bronysith: Not sure if you saw my post earlier, but I really wanted to vote for Derpy. I ended up just giving my ballot to my mom and telling her to fil it out however she wants because I got sick of hearing my parents lecture me about how to vote
naturesfury: OH... GREAT... just what i need
naturesfury: as if luna games 0-5 wasnt enough
You you what's more reliable than ballot machines... semipermanent markers and paper
Also most forum polling systems.
i don't give a shit about who wins, but what i have been hearing about romney worries me...
lol all political campaigns better be like THIS in the future :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEIi3X9NCMU
Are more reliable than ballot machines, I mean.
My parents were mad I didn't vote early - when asked why I didnt, told them I wasn't worried about Romney winning Texas - Obama is pretty much vilified around here anyway
same here Derpy_Hooves

ugh... chat's getting boring. there;s nothing streaming. gonna leave soon if nothing intersting happens.

I'm eating grits for dinner. :P
05,15Ross Perot was awesome
No, his veep was awesome. Dude turned his hearing aid off during the Veep debate.
Smartest play in political history.
Were I old enough at the time I might have voted Perot, but alas 7 is too young :D
WHAAA- oh 1% for South Carolina
05,15Lol there's a commercial on slamming socialism.
Anything gonna stream soon? :$
Is the stream not working?
I'm trying to turn them all, though.
i hear halo4 came out today.... gogo mods
socialism isnt bad
Hai guys, wassup?
fluttercry: I was in elementary school when Ross Perot ran against Bush/Clinton and we had to give presentations about one of the candidates. The teacher ended up having to assign people to do Bush and Clinton because everyone wanted to do Perot
Socialism is grreat!

I for one have nothing against Luna, but if war broke out I'd side with celestia.
Shizuka, check your email, also aparently you should 'recive a bag' if you;re in the beta
celestia would win me over
molestia is bestia

Celestia vs Angry Sun from SMB3
Phase4 linux beta started ?

The BBC need to stop wasting money on these infographics. They're horrible. :S
13i bet i won't get a invite in the first wave cause i took the survey from asuka, who is windows :3
who wants someone who wears dark colors and moons you all the time.. thenyells whenever she tanks
Phase4 and what is dis bag you talk about ?
Shizuka, i was in windows at the time also, doubt they count that though
13is k
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, no idea
Shizuka: wouldn't they want people who use windows? They need to make the transition easy
13i'm not on laptop enough to quite need it at least
has anyone seen Hellsing Ultimate Abridged ep 3 yet?
60k responses, so 1/60 chance

YAAAAY gangnam style
DoctoDoctorWho, uh... super computers can't do real time tasks like video games
Desktop computers FTW
weeping_pegasi82: I like to listen to them back to back
DoctoDoctorWho, i meen you could probably make them do it with dificulty, even then though you cant split the games workload across numa nodes

Ryunosuke: that reminds me of one of the first debates about Equestria not long after I got into this fandom - was about why there was a need to raise the sun by magic - the planet could be stagnet, no rotation, so instead of Celestia raising the sun, she's rotating the planet - this was way before season 2 was thought of
