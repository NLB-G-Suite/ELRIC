Hey....Hitler was a great leader and outstanding public speaker, you show him some respect.

Yes he is a bad person, but the man had skills.
AW SHIT AMERICA
The follow up however...
Well not really
Kennedy was also charismatic, but people complain about him wanting to start Vietnam.
Nazis were only trying to purify the world.
well, terrorized is a bad term, i meant oppressed
MegaPirahna. :3
$10,000 budget is all they need to make a great terrible movie mock-up.

FOX News as a whole isn't that bad, it's just select commentators that everyone makes fun of.

They probably could.
/me sleeps on Angel's Head
Fox 'News'
If the truck had a GPS, you could hack the truck, control it, overheat the engine.
4chan is more politically correct than Fox News is.
8,6gonna set up for some music requests and be back in just a minute
FOX is closer to the center as a whole than MSNBC.
Since stream's down, this is the clip of evil racist babies
I do enjoy listening to Fox occasionally, though. It's quite amusing.
It's only 1 minute 30
XD
The only difference is that MSNBC is rather sad, and Fox is rather hilarious.
Alright, I have to go. America is great, kill the terrorists!

Hiya everypony :)
8,6ok, going to be taking some music requests in #Vinyl_Scratch, keep the requests clean though, music only
Crud
Good, good :)
Or rugby.
nice luna remix
I tried watching American football once
nvm
They played for 2 minutes, then stopped for 5 minutes to comment on the 2 minutes.
Then played for 2 minutes again.
XD
It's kind of annoying to be honest.
Still not yet caught yet
0,5MURRIKA
Rugby has a lot more action IMO
Aw shit, AMERICA!
its very easy to bring nittany out of hiding
I dunno, I think it was some superbowl thing.
i think this is metal remixes of a bunch of pony songs
But near the end, they take HUGE pauses between each play because everyone's trying to drag out the remaining clock time.
woop
8,6just realized how low my sound was
kirzstyfe
kk thanks :p
Why be complex when you can be easy
wait, that came out wrong
Or the world could stop playing team sports and paying players millions to kick a ball and actually contribute to society. But thats my opinion.
lol
*they
a rumor not quite as it seems
to be honest sports doesn't really intrest me the closest thing to a sport i'm intreasted in is pro wrestling
