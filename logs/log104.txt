:8
That's a hueg fish.

Huh, I don't remember him sounding so squeaky as a halfling
Where was Gondor when a halfling was drowning?

SHINY......
Where was Gondor when the ring was found again
DAT FACE
hi guys
11One's Gollum/Smeagol, the other is a random hobbit.
8o hai radiance
Well at least I almost died with a shiny object in my grasp.
hi
So... shiny... MUST KILL!!
Where's radiance?
I lose fish, but I FINDS A SHINY!
Dem ears.
ew
Does anyone think it would be cool if this guy became gollum instead of Smeagol?
lol
6One's Gollum/Smeagol, the other is Deagol.
Looks like shit.
what became of the dwarves' rings?
8shes here, arwen
It's a golden band thingy.
Random Trivia: The opening scene - in which Smeagol discovers the Ring and starts on the slippery slope towards ultimately becoming Gollum - was actually directed by Fran Walsh. Originally it was set to appear in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, immediately after Frodo first revealed Gollum's real name.
Where was gondor when Smeagol killed his brother?
Shiny...
I started everything

Rough sex.
OH GOD NOT THE EYE GOUGE ATACK
10not bad shadowlurker, you?
*wave* Hello everypony!
spoiler:thats Gollum
Man, this is intense.
this doesnt make any sense. Hobbits are resistant to the ring's power
well, certainly better than just tossing it into a stream
i really don't get what this ring actually does whats its purpose
Sirius_Black? COMBO BREAKER
ring is shiny, therefore it is worth killing people for
LOGIC.
Suplex him
my internet seems slow...
Hate detected
there's no way this is going to end well.
thats why you should use lube
thump
Rapidly press Square!
thump
Smeagol is probably very weak willed.
thump
Ring used Frenzy on humanoids. It was super effective.
PRESS X TO NOT DIE
:C
It is the beating of his hideous heart!!!
lagy as hell
THERE IS NO SQUARE BUTTON ON THE KEYBOARD
Fire the friendship cannon.
*cue God of War theme*
They aren't quite hobbits

Mmmmmmmm. These are some good muffins I'm eating.
GREETINGS EVERYONE
3Devolving, Smeagol is doing it right.
Given that the ring can change sizes, I don't think it would mind gaining a hook and latch to fit on somepony's ear.

11That was weird.

If Pinkie was there it would be the best party in the universe

I mean, who else could've thought up that song on the spot for those two?
Rainbows make Aragorn cry
Gandalf has doubts?
/me is flying Gmod style in the bunker
I read the script. I know he lives.
LOL FRODO IS DEAD
Scary
Frodo's Twitter: "Lol...I totally ignored Aragorn's wall posts"

And Elijah Wood has voiced Spyro in his last 3 games. Now everything's been bought full circle
In this scene Gollum talks of cuisine of living beings
oh
Sam's like "Oh not agaaaaain"
Helm's Deep

IMBECILIC OBESE HALFLING
.....................................
HE'S FAT AND THEREFORE BAD
"If he tries anything, Sam will kill him."
HRWAAAAR
GET HIM GUY FROM THE GOONIES
Frodo: Your lifelong friend of 30-40 years or the thing that's tried to kill your uncle and you at least three separate times. Which do you trust?
HE'S FAT=EVIL!
6I AM NOT A DOUCGE, FILTHY HOBBIT
/me punches Legolas
Where was Gondor when Frodo was a dumbass?
PEGACORN PAWNCH
Clearly the latter
He's a villaiN!
HE ARE VILLAIN
Man, Frodo is dense
villain?
A VILLIAN!
4Doucge?
Yeah, a trolling guide
He has a twirly villain mustache, even!
I believe the proper term is "antagonist"
That Gollum is a spy!
10Doucge.
/me 3stabs Pegacorn with an arrow!

A rogue!
4Little Smeagol

Where was Gandalfs spell check when i misspelt douche?
(execute.power.reroute.exe?) *route found* initializing.......
HE ARE VILLAIN
Frodo doesn't read the scripts of the movies he is in
gollum is trolling them.
A coward, bully, cad and thief!
/me is now confused
Frodo= Good Guy Greg
/me does the Dougie
4That is all kinds of incorrect
............................
T.T
I'm always on the good side.

Doucge with a side order of Sarumand

Damn it, Frodo Baggins, YOU'RE HEALING AN ENEMY SPY!
/me does the dinosaur all the way to Mordor
Littany_Tiger It was a nice try though
Can't stop thinking about balls
Gandalf is asleep. Post ponies.
pippin's got balls on the brain
Frodo is griefing. !votekick
one does not simply dinosaur into mordor Gabemoist
Open the door get on the floor, everybody walk the dinosaur.
Littany?
gandolf gets the good room.
ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY DINOSAUR INTO MORDOR
DuskShine, my mind is still tainted from what you said
Light my Littany.

Legolas *foreign file encountered* Execute aversion.exe. files averted.
so they deleted the rape scene?
3WELL I DID ANYWAY
STOP HIM
It's RAPE-TIME!
gollum techinically is neutral in this thing right he only cares about the ring for himself
14THEN DONT WAKE ME UP!
Pippin, mmmm 'ss good
I've read enough high literature to see where this is going
More people are killed by doing the wave every year than by sharks.
Light sleeper
Adventure Time!!
yea man!
/me 8is trying to get some action
Pity sex
Caring about the ring for himself does not = neutral. It makes him a selfish bastard
Eowyn's whispering every line, Aragorn has an elf-boner now
You know, normally I'd feel sad for Eowyn. But she ends up hooking with Faramir, who's way beeter than some crappy ranger :P
/me 14denied Aragorn said action
well hes on neither side
I had a dream, it told me to take my clothes off for you
He's nuts is what he is
/me performs the forbidden facepalm
/me 8was cockblocked
AND THEN HOT SEX
Technically. But he's still evil rather than good.
I have a dream!
I think Aragorn might deserve some action after saving her entire country
I thought she ended up with Eomer?
6Smeagol = good; Gollum = bad; Split personalities are fun!
Where was Gondor when Eowyn was frigid?
Well, I... I apologize, Pinkie_Pie. For whatever it is I said.
/me 14missions is now complete!

Amazing rock!

ORLANDOOO
Wow. New Zealand has awesome mountains
I do believe that link is be-fucked
He always moves. Looks all over the place.
7that was a quick mission
what does the ring do i honestly dont see anything that's such a big freakin deal except that ohh you turn invisible
Pippin needs his fix
He in some ways is bad
8damn straight, anon!
Did anyone else see the supernova a few days ago
?
Test #8, I hope for a response this time. What age of middle Earth does the three movies take place in?
No problem, just dont say whatever it was you said again.
Lol
Where was Gondor when the eye of the enemy was moving? D:
LOTRivia: Peter Jackson is arachnophobic and based the Shelob design on the types of spiders he feared the most.
Slumber party!
4Did I mention that I can sleep with my eyes open?

Okay, I'll make sure I don't.

Gandalf is dead!
It's why Deagle was so easily corrupted by the ring. He was very slightly corrupt himself.
4You viewers creeped out yet?
Frodo congrats
Gandalf watches you even when hes sleeping
gandalf sleeps with eyes open? badass
That's.... scary
11Gandalf is so badass, he sleeps with his eyes open.

14Fluttershy certainly invades my mind too
LOTRivia: A normal major motion picture averages about 200 effects shots. This film had 1488.
Is that a tree in your robe or are you happy that i am alive, Gandalf?

For the love of Luna...
every one of the guards at these posts slept with the guard-captain's daughter

Too much trolls, not enough mods
noooooooooooo!
Aboutish CopperCogs. But i read a weirder one on a picture. That one ended with "Then Twilight was tree"

Artemis is technically gender neutral
The moon has traditionally had feminine connotations, Dusk.
hammer time
I heard Ahnuld!
I never knew a crater-covered rock in the sky could be so... feminine.
...
It makes it rather hard.
@DuskShine makes sense
b.a. dragon thing time
0That's because the moon goddess was traditionally female.

Gandalf, did you summon that dramatic music?

NO HOPE.
CAn't they just walk around minas tirith and destroy everything else, therefore forcing all their soldiers to fight them in the open and not in a massive castle?
That spell needed to be a rainbow
Paladin mage outta nowhere
Gandalf used Flash. Super effectve.
Trolls hate the light
Gandalf used epic choir boy music
/me wants to learn that spell.
I wish I could summon dramatic music just like that
it was super effective
use don't fdeed the trolls
0Gandalf used flashlight. It's supereffective
One does not simply walk around minas tirith
0I can't find anything to back it up, but I was told there used to be two main pagan gods, traditionally. The sun god was male, the moon god was female. And the moon goddess was the god of fertility and sex.
Both Masterlinkx and Mast3rlinkx are gone ;-;
MWAHAHAHAHAH!YOU WILL NEVER FIND ME
lol, I like where you're going anon
we have been defeated, but the war is not yet lost
Gandalf used castrato.

My eyes they burn with my lack of sleep

11Gandalf_The_White: They're all bipolar
STILL climbing
0Oh wow, I didn't know you guys were so afraid of sex. My bad.
@Gandalf_The_White I blame inbreeding. You know the middle ages was rank with it
He wants pictures! Pictures of Boromir!
11and what valthejean said
Gandalf_the_white, they all have ear infections. It's affecting their balance.
*clicks* tl;dr
I have no time for links, watching LOTR
Gollum: :D
6Crimson, stop breaking rules, maybe you won't get kicked.

6We have a no links rule. >>;
YOU CALL THOSE STAIRS, YOU SICK FUCK?
Best part coming up
He's warning him about those stairs
What stairs
I warned you about those stairs, Frodo.
These stairs suck
0I don't mind being kicked. Sorry. Didn't know.
I told you, dog!
come to meeeeeeeeee
COME TO SMEAGOL
Those stairs are poorly designed, who's the engineer who made them? No guardrail or anything?
eff stairs
Wish I didn't have to scroll down to comment so I can see the movie
its a bloody cliff
shiny things change people - fact
Why doesn't Gollum just throw them off the cliff?
psych
3Smeagol And that link pretty much r34
and there's still troops marching out of that citadel down below
@Dashite: Because then he has to go get the ring back :P
Smeagol kicked his ass that one time
Called him fat, that's what
I kinda wanna click that link now
You could try having two windows open, one with the stream running and one watching the chat.
Because then he would have to climb all the way down to get the ring.
Fat one
0Not even!
goddammit frodo, grow some grey shit in that log of a head of yours
Where'd all these fat insults come from?
Alternatively, zoom out.
DuskShine, I have three.
Gollum could have gotten the ring and killed both of them SO EASILY right there
You dumb frodo?
/me 11has been doing what DuskShine said
frodo is not a clever hobbit
FAT HOBBITSES
0Do it, DSN. It's just a bunch of words. No pics.
his virginity?
There were hardly any in TT
3I don't need religious sex guides in my chat thank-you-very-much
LOTRivia: The Lord of the Rings trilogy became the most nominated film series in Academy Award history with 30 nominations, surpassing both the Godfather trilogy (28) and the Star Wars franchise (21).
4Damn, Smeagol passed the speech check
He is only here to troll kick the parasprite!
sam vs gollum is my fav part
Movie, Chat and Photoshop
i swear frodo is derped
4I'm impressed
Fat Tricksy
Sam looks fine. Healthy.
And obviously he's more trustworthy than my friend for several years
TROLL THEM ALL
0SORRY! I was only trying to back up the thing I said about Luna!
Know gardener whole life, listen to thieving little schizo

Steward of Gondor has totally hit Level 4 *somewhat doubts anypony will get the reference*
Pippin wasn't thinkig
Is there any black actors in this trilogy?
Fool of a took
too much white
LOTRivia: According to the cast commentary, although Lawrence Makoare was the person in the Witch-King's costume, his voice was later performed by Andy Serkis (also playing Gollum).
you weren't thinking anything. like usual
For some reason I can only think of Monster Hunter Tri when I see the nazgul
Stuck in the waiting room

ValtheJean, sure he was. He was killed by like 1 arrow. What a wimp.
Was,
eh hold that thought, Monster Hunter IS awesome
Spoiler: No he won't.
Why "was"?
Fealty? eewwww
Where was Gondor when Monster Hunter was awesome?
@Dashite : Phfff....technicalities :P

With Liberty and Justice for all.
He goofed up the speech

Yes, you will be rewarded.

You could say your reward will be... eternal.

Father of the week, every century.

Oh I see, i you put a number sign at the beginning it creates a link, that must be inconvenient
He's an awesome dad to one kid, horrible to the other. On average... he's a pretty okay dad.
And then he falled
Denethor is more honest than Applejack is
Don't forget your armor.
CriticKitten, beaten by half a second. :p
I haven't read the books in a long time. I really ought to buy them again and get to that.
@Ham993 he sent his other son to his death

Dude, that bread was delicious. D:
FAT HOBBIT.
SNEAKING?
XD
FAT HOBISSES
He doesn't sneak, Sam! What do you think he is, a spy?
6And I think that you shouldn't use it at all.
Those aren't even numbers
6End of story.
Fat hobbit is funny
SneaKINGASS usual I see
SNEEEAAAAAK?
SNeakers gonna sneak
SNEEEEK
Sneaking
SNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEKING
Secret ways that are painfully obvious.
Smeagol should change his name to Sauron.
U MAD, FAT HOBBIT?
I don't see [hidden] above his head so he wasn't sneaking....oh nevermind
Problem?
Smeagol confirmed for ninja
Hat fobbit
8SnooPINGAS usual i see
smeagol but that's boring
Skinny Tricksy Gollum
This is a SNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEKING mission, Snake.
frodo is a heavy sleeper
I bet Smeagol has an Unusual Conniver's Kunai.
It's not that dark
!
There are no cardboard-boxes on top of the mountain to sneak.
Anyone know how to get a hold of MrChess from Synchtube?
Problem, stupid fat hobbit?
The fat one ate it
Smeagol is a closet bread addict
>Crumbs on his jacket.
Gollum is such a ham in this scene.
Jesus...Loyalty doesn't exist in this movie...
jacketses
Doesn't eat it, can't have taken it. DAT LOGIC
HE TOOK IT
oh snap
aw.
>implying
Man, I'd throw that little fuck off the cliff right there

How did those stay on that cloak the whole time?
Sam is just an asshole. A good thing Smeagol looked RIGHT THROUGH IT
XD Frikkin' fat hobbit
Gollum-flavor ham?
ELEMENTS OF RINGBEARING
Sam, you are my best friend, which is why I don't believe you over gollum
PAWNCH
4But it's good he wasn't thrown off
dat ground & pound
RAAAAAGE
Sam is the real hero of the series
poor sam.lol
Applejack, they don't have Rainbow_Dash
8gotta hand it to gollum, he can take a beating like no other
Gollum's thinking "Woooooorth it"
4If Sam had killed him, then who knows how the story would have ended
as much as Ben Linus
We already rested!
Frodo has a 2 in Intelligence
Rainbow_Dash is here too?
Sam has a short temper
gollum can take a punch like a bus.
that anger
o.O
7we never know
i guess so

0Huh huh huh, he said load

Apparently I have twisted mind. :/

If Gandalf were there he could summon more
Samwise has left the fellowship.
frodo why you so gulliable!
Samwise is best friend.
Fancy helmet
He's too stupid to know any better :( It's like Of Mice and Men
They love the troops
Faramir is about to raid ICC with a party of lvl 60s
Don't worry, Rudywise. Your time to shine will come.
bai gais. have fun dying
To be fair, Frodo does have the ring working on his brain
YOU ARE NOT PREPARED
in b4 suicide
YAAAY TROOPS!
Bye bye. Have fun dying.
STEP ON THE FLOWERS
He would tend the rabbits but Sam killed them for the stew.
Suicide by orc.
They can barely contain themselves
isn't that the little girl from the first film?
STEP ON THEM ALL
I would have put the ring in a lead box
Send out the last defenders of your city to get killed to punish your sun = GRANTED SUCCESS
FARAMIR> I LOVE YOU
Gray... thingy
Faramir! Don't do it! We love you. ;_;

He sure has some serious daddy issues
...Who is that actor?
Faramir is the Caramel of LotR
Gandalf uses love
That guy from 300
Faramir is a man's man
YUP

Gandalf, quit spoiling the story!
there we go Meanwhile
Faramir is Seth
brb gona die quick
fights under kings and lives
ValtheJean, but he isn't in love with Aragorn (Big Mac). O.o
Faramir has to die by author's feat. To make space for ARAGOOOOOOOOOOOORN
I have no idea what his name is
I knew the was familiar
But he's in 300
@Dashite I WILL KILL YOU
Yeah the storyteller
man faramir is loyal
STARE
So basically, it is because of Aragorn that Faramir dies
8so much pony
11DAMNIT GANDALF, USE SOME SPOILERTAGS WHEN YOU SAY STUFF LIKE THAT!
I remember now
And so my king died, and my brothers died yada yada yada

For the very last scene in the movie, even though Jackson had the take he wanted, he kept doing the scene again, and again just to delay the official end of filming

Middle Earth is hell. Every other location is evil.
LOTRivia: According to a magazine article, Peter Jackson hated the Army of the Dead; he thought it was too unbelievable. He kept it in the script because he did not wish to disappoint diehard fans of the book trilogy.
inb4 Army of the Dead..."Shoo be doo"
G3.5!! There doomed if they go in there
Pft. 200k? So why worry about numbers then if you've already got no shot? XD

I hate it when I love stuff from G1.
No no sea ponies
Sea Ponies are awesome.
Dealö with it
SHOO BE DOO SHOOP SHOO BE DOO
14Lyra as a seapony, lmao
Arwen, out of nowhere
Sea ponies were at least funny.
"SHOO BE DOO MOTHEF**ERS"
"Who is, you is, Applejack"
....suddenly I want someone to take the audio from Sea Ponies and transcribe it onto the Army of the Dead scene, ValtheJean
Sea Ponies are ok
3NOT LYRA
I didn't know the MLP franchise existed until Physics Brony
4That's because DCD knows most people hate sea ponies
ping
@CriticKitten I'm telling ya, it'll happen
4HAHA

Oh dear
I actually wouldn't mind sea ponies showing up in Friendship-

AAAAAAAAHHH

Aragorn killed the stream!
Twice.
11that was awesome.
So did it land on the ground or what?
WHERE WAS GONDOR?

DDD
4EVERYTHING WAS ALL A DREAM
4But yeah

4As soon as he wakes up "the end"
14Inafter lots of spam

4Anyways

/me 11is laughing for real right now
4Please remain patient
6We wants it... we needs it... we must have the stream...
11oh, that timing was too perfect.
Where was Gondor when the timing was awesome?
take all the time you need to fix the stream
LOL, it went off line when he woke up! Perfect timing!
RINGCEPTION *BWOOOOOOOOONG*
THE SUSPENCE
My hand is a dolphin!
Well, I went out to prepare supper when Gollum framed Sam with the bread. Would anypony mind telling me what has happened since then?
oh man
That was kinda cool.
> Stream explodes
GONDOR WAS WHERE GONDOR WAS DAMMIT! IT CAN'T MOVE!
> Chat follows shortly afterwards
And then they all fucked.
Pippin did a sad song while douche king showed bad manners.
We beta-tested season 2, sotha
@Sotha: Shit got fucked, and little people sang songs
/me reads that Brief History of Religious Sex link.
Stuff happened.
Hopefully it'll run more smoothly on my computer when it start back up
WHERE WAS GONDOR WHEN GONDOR COULDN'T MOVE?
Faramir is sending everyone after the orcs
That was fucking awesome timing though
Where was Gondor when gondor was where?
DAMMIT MEANWHILE! :p
Merry has an awesomeface when he gets geared
Where was Gondor when the movie went off line at the right spot
WHERE WAS GONDOR WHEN I WAS DAMNED?
aeiou
At this rate, come 7am GMT, my parents are going to find my withered husk and catch the start of the credits.
Aragorn had a dream then the dream ended as soon as the dream ended
john madden
My hand is a dolphin!
Should this be any other place I'd be pissed, but here Bronystate the stream dropping is just as fun as anything else.
Darf14, Gondor ceased to exist because it's fictional and without the stream there was no Gondor.
stream*
DREAMCEPTION
Can I have a link to the stream? Sorry.
11Guys, consider this an intermission while we try to figure out what happened.
My eyes hurt
i need caffine MONSTER TIME
ok
Oh, is it just overall down?
Good words of wisdom Dashite
How much left in the movie?
But intermission is supposed to happen right when they call for Grond!
We can't trust an intermission with an unspecified time limit!
Well time for drink
woohoo, no classes tomorrow!
So the stream going offline worked as a kick for Aragorn?
It's almost 4am here.
oh, its Drawfriends time then!
How will i know if i have time to grab some caffiene?!
caffeine
Faith
mmm
Have some tea
That takes time!
6The technical problems are being worked out, everypony.
0mmmm, caffeine....
Time i may not have!
Have some rum
6One moment please.
RUM?
Well, then i will continue to write my fan-fic.
MY RUM IS GONE
RUM!
LOTRivia: Elijah Wood is noted for his ability to stare fixedly in front of him for ages without blinking, which came in very useful for the scenes where the comatose Frodo was wrapped up in Shelob's web-like cocoon.
Drawfreind is good today
WHERE WAS GONDOR WHEN THE RUM WAS GONE?!
Take your time. It's almost morning anyways.
Why is the rum gone?!?!?!
Take some ground up coffee, put it in your mouth and swish it around with some water

No time for that, just grab a bag of coffee beans and eat them like candy.
How about a nice cup of tea?
11The huricane screwed up Veemi, and Veemi is screwing up BMN.
Just a moment! You can’t leave a tea party without having a cup of tea, you know!
Darth Vader: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
Can we put a timer on this intermission?
I don't function well without schedule
Good thing I live away from water.
Dammit
3NOPE SORRY, YOUR /NICK IS DENIED

Gollum, don't beat yourself up over this.
Which means you're lying. And liars get imprisoned. Then banished. Then imprisoned in the place they were banished to.,
You want some cake?
FOR THE NEXT 3 HOURS, SIT QUIETLY AND WE WILL CONTROL ALL THAT YOU SEE AND HEAR.
PPPP

Screw that. I'll play my own personal Return of the King and sync it here.

Oh crap.
Why'd Aragorn have to stab the camera guy anyway
0I was actually watching the movie on one computer and chatting on the other.

Meanwhile, I weigh one stone. It's just a really big stone.
Dual monitors has NEVER been this useful :D
Who heres wants to know how discord looks like?
I use 2 windows side by side
Dashite outta nowhere.
Reaver14, YES
hes probably BLACK
Dusk, let me impart to you a word of wisdom from Celestia... Solaris himself.
"Run."
Wait, we're streaming from FRANCE!? :wut:
XD
Everyone assumes Discord will look like male NMM
Meanwhile 7 stones = 98 pounds. I guess I do weigh more.
TWO WINDOWS IS THE NAME OF THE GAME
Meanwhile, outta no where? Bah! I've been here the whole time!
blub blub
I was watching it on DVD an keeping it synced with the stream
0Dischord is going to be like the adults in the old Charlie Brown comics where you never really get a full view of him.
I hope discord will be black and red evil.
Discord will be an amorphous spirit
0Is the secondary stream working for you, guys?
no
no
Meanwhile But you're still adopted
Nope
nope
Discord will be derpy's true Identity
I can't get the secondary stream to work. =/

Discord will sing a pony version of Toxic Love

The .co.cc stream is up

Michael Bay directed The Rock.
michael bay?
michael bay shouldnt present anything
LOTRivia: In the scene when Denethor attempts to burn Faramir on the pyre, the pyre could not truly be on fire because Gandalf's horse would not go near it. To solve this, the crew reflected a real fire onto a pane of glass in front of the camera so that it looks as though the pyre is burning.
He would have called it Friendship is Explosions.

Where was Gondor when this movie was fucking epic?
4With the plight of the army being washed away, BronyState sweeps through the city cleansing it of filth and stupidity
Final tally
everyone knows Legolas is a glass cannon and Gimli is a fighter/carry, naturally he'll pick off more small fry
EQD is saved

Maenwhile that...wont be....neccesary....
noo?
who was that?
spam no
I normally am annoyed of P Jackson slowmo deathscenes but....:(
3Welp, sorry Eowyn, I guess your dead
WAT
did she died?
This one gets me
what about the theoden?
overdramatic
14:(
inb4 liv tyler song
I thought she lived
nah, she just hurted herself
4....I thought Eowyn lived >.>
WHAT. HOW DID SHE DIE
Man I haven't seen this movie inforever, I forgot EVERYTHING
remember, she has to marry Farmir :P
I think he was trying to convey an emotion of some sort
WELP, best set her on fire!
Faramir*
magnets killed her
she inherited her dad's singing ability
She stabbed the Witch King
11The same, Gandalf_The_white
i'm confused
ever had a shield shatter while your using it?
.....Neamwhile?
8same, crimson
DON'T BE SO QUICK TO CALL HER DEAD
WeanMile!
Neamnile?
She lived in the book, yeah
Is this why Faust never got to do Season 2?
Dang magnets, they can kill now
she lives, this is one of those cut parts
Gandalf_the_white, she did.
MEANWHILE!
like hell she dies
8last time i saw this movie i was high off my ass too
4I like how it's Aragorn that helps her, not her brother
yeah, I remember reading in the book she just needed medical attention because of the deep rooted poison for coming so close to a nazgul
Eowyn will live, but she's not going to be the producer on Season 2
3OH WAIT
I think the director wanted a less dramatic "No" but he couldn't be bothered filming it again
Tragic Tragic...
YFW season 2 is meh
She just under the effects of the Witch king
3MABYE SHE IS ALIVE
Aragorn has more ranks in first aid.
Homer is not important!
3D'OH
@Gandalf_The_White the reason is that Aragorn was a master healer
4Well, he IS a ranger
so this is what they filled 1 extra hour with?
4WHOA
4FARAMIR
Aragorn is a ranger. He has Heal as a class skill.
And so, folks, Lauren Faust became just a counseling producer.
4AWESOME
Damn it, DSNesmith, now season two of Lord of the Rings is ruined.
>yfw in the books this scene is longer than the battle
<boing>
Phew... for a second there I thought this movie was going to be stupidly dramatic for no reason...
lol...I wasn't lying :P
Over 1000 people died and her death is more important, I guess royalty gives you that kind of attention
4We need moar Faramir in this film
And herbalism
So near yet so Far.
oh hai there Faramir
amir.
Scoot scootalooo
YO MERRY, WHERE YOU AT
@gandalf_the_white YFW season 2 isnt as good as season 1

4Awesome bromance moment

Dashface, right there.
Meanwhile You have no idea how much Science was done after that battle
BOIL HIM MASH HIM STICK HIM IN A STEW
Heart surgery, your doing it wrong
Sam leveled up
beggin your pardon but they haven't
BROMANTIC STARE SCENE
I, um... shared the load...
Sam just countertrolled all of Mordor
POTATOES
owned
SHARE THE LOAD
I thought I'd... lost you....
3Loyalty +6
"frodo will you marry me"
ThunderDash SHUT IT
About dam time Sam gained a level, now he is at level 5
SHARE THE LOAD
xD
share the loaaaad
yeah alright, give the crackhead his crack
Sam.
Sam's too stupid to have the Ring take him over
Load load load load load
SHARE THE LOOOOOOOOOOAD
You're welcome!
nothin at all, nothing at all, nothing at alllll
*eats the ring*
I don't know if Sam ws hesitating because of Frodo's obsession or because the ring was tempting him.
Sam shares the load
ALL THE SCIENCE
both?
share the..... loading..... loading....
So that wheezy sound is the ring being tempting?
dat boy chest
Was it both?
Feels good bro
4It was probably both, DuskShine
White Hobbit's burden
this is a metaphor for marriage
Meanwhile 124,385,396,106,863,285,175,089,294,342.12 SCI's of Science,
i agree with Gandalf DuskShine
yeah what would the orcs think
One cannot simply walk into Mordor naked,
>implying one can walk through mordor
Makes sense.
ALMOST THERE
How much is left?
its 4chan
Oh hey Discord
>mfw a conversation is going on inside the conversation
or....
11...
There's the 4chan Server
they be in 4chan
Discord
they got their proxies on
Dat armor.
11what's with the bird helmets?
This is not gonna help with Treebeard's whole hobbit/orc confusion
lol at the helmets
nice beak
Meanwhile in terms of Science, that's actually comparatively little
4Mordor = Moot's home
So many anonymous!
the trolls
Moar Door say "MOAR"
orcs be stylin
ITS HIM
"We did it Mr. Frodo... we made it to the third book... and it only took us over half the third movie."
THE MODS!
MOOT!
THE EYE
take a stroll through mordor road...
quick pretend to be bird men
8o hai sauron
Nice mask
It's an Oblivion gate!
The eye of MOOT!
They got the "Special" Orc armor.
that one sunny spot in back is /f/
14He lost his contact lens
Frodo: We're SoL, oh well, lets go back to the shire and piss around with the ring
There in the heart of 4chan.
moot is dead, sauron is the final boss of the internet
maybe you can steal saurin's contact lense
6Aren't you a little short to be an Orc?
4Welp, time to give my thoughts on our strategy again
Souron is the king of /b/
He lost his signal
Psychic powers!!
Or maybe Suaron= internet hate machine
Suddenly, Han Solo is an orc
Smeagol, you win
gimlie, sitting on a throne
lika a boss
Meanwhile very well. Think of the number I told you, and multiply it by 352,457,374,948. THAT is how much Science I do DAILY.
Over 9000 Anonymous.
6So much weed in these movies.
And not a single f*ck was given by Gimli.
On the one hand, we've won the battle.
4Oh well, my bad
Gimli just wants to drink and smoke.
cool story gandalf
He doesn't mean to be cruel, he just wants a damn smoke.
over 10,000! That's a lot of people that go to 4chan
On the other hand, the ring is in Sauron's territory and his army is in a prime location to snatch it up.
... yeah, we're doomed.
Time to troll 4chan
Meanwhile Yes, I am.
counterraid time
Smeagol = How else would you unwind from shit this serious
14I would need a lot of weed to get through all this too
We can't give up DuskShine!!!
Now we march towards 4chan!
Aragorn u crazy
A diversion!
TOWARDS 4CHAN
What are we waiting for?
11what are we waiting for?
The final pony raid of /b/.
To get rid of hate in the internet, they must destroy 4chan once and for all!
Darf14 4chan gets ~5mil unique hits a day
8ITS A TRAP
14Gimli is all for it
6Let's all go get banned! =D
Gimli = Leeroy Jenkins?
Meanwhile Yes, I am *ERROR* Irony Core Malfunction, (please reboot)
There over LV 80, the main characters will be fine
Gimli should have is own comedy special
Aragorn's so badass he takes his sword to make phone calls
Darf14 thats 5mil people a day
/me likes thisplan
Gimli is Dash for their cockiness
OH SHIT HE CAN SEE THE world

inb4 aragon ends up at the gate with a jar of dirt
O HAI SAURON
Aragon is a sexy man

4Aragorn, you're so fucking crazy and that plan is sheer ludicrousy
@Spazturtle Dang! I didn't know that! 0_o

Aragorn contacts Sauron thru skype

He's being read Cupcakes
I've seen enough hentai....
Im not afraid of you 4chan!

We need a pic of Gimli watching MLP

Aragorn has the sword of Lauren Faust.
Nonchalant.
Trolls on the march, it must be cateday
We need a pic of the entire Fellowship watching MLP.
Just imagine Gimli.... "AHAHA! Pinkie Pie, you're so random!"
fly casual
Bad vision
Wow lol

aragorn, gimli and legolas, in front of a tv, watching ponies
brb
Uh oh
14Just didnt even notice them lmao
Herospirit LOL
I wonder how they feed the orcs

Fuck the mods!
:P
NOTHING IS GROWING THERE
14Now they did!

Trojan hobbits
11wow, that worked better than they thought.
Rezo2, big farms in mordor

Good thing they wear that Anon mask

There's the stream, in case you're wondering.

Frodo and Sam have tripcodes, it's only a matter of time till they're discovered
wow 4chan mods are mean.

6DuskShine, let the mods handle it.
Mods handle all things.
Sorry.
3SamWise=SamFisher
6Especially since you gave the link we're trying not to give.
Then Gimli and Legolas killed the two hobbits. THE END
toot
2 streams open at once. ECHO
Trolls... organized?
Where was gondor when the mods were handling things?

Halt your Company
Ork WHAAAAAAAG

14INSPECTION!
/me feels awkward now.
troll inspection.
lmao. Orc Inspection
a test inside a test
4Damn
TESTCEPTION
That chain must hurt
"They have... TRIPCODES"
=/
Dat lack of nose.
Tripcode check? *hit*

He wasn't joking when he said it was a burden
ECHOOOOOOOOOOOO

It's like enemy AI in every stealth game
Mod was asleep. Escape ponies

This is why 4chan mods suck
One does not simply DDoS into 4chan.
Wait...there is someone named why?
Meanwhile What did I miss?
Hello.
why is there a dude named why in here?
yeah
I asked that a while ago.
idk
Why is why's name why?
why a b c d e f g
Why not?
why?
ehy indeed?
6One does not simply Metal Gear Solid into Mordor
This is the third movie of the trilogy, correct?
inb4 why spam
-.-
yes
7yes it is
yes
4chan mods sucks because they're practically chosen at random.
i why
need moar cardboard box
why, yes it is
One does not simply QWOP into mordor.
Everyone say why
Not sure why, but I don't remember anyone answering so... *shrug*
I regret discovering that name by accident!
why?
frying panXD
WHY
Needs more "!"
What.
what?
?
11stop with the Why
Maybe take the armor off?
i think the ring might have turned into lead
SAY WHY AGAIN. SAY WHY ONE MORE GODDAMN TIME.
That stupid ring just weights 5 gramm, you pussy.
Dam it all!
Meanwhile ARE YOU BUCKING KIDDING ME, THAT WAS MY FAVORITE GOD DAMN PART, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Which?
what a good plan
go straight that way
doesnt a trilogy have 27 books?
Why should I?
THEY SPEAK ENGLISH IN WHAT?
No
wow nice plan getting rid of that armor.
inb4 kick
running naked through mordor
he lost his pack ratm perk
weeeeeeeeee
what are we watching?
y throw it? couldnt they just leave it there lol
A trilogy has 3 books.
DSNemith: Why?
no a trillogy has 999992637 books
Celestia is channeling hope.
ENGLISH MUTHERBUCKER DO U SPK IT?
sam, use cardboard box and porn, that always works
shipping scene
Random lightning bolt!
Woo! Mordor naked guild run!
Trilogy = Tri = 3
ALRIGHT CHUMS LETS DO THIS
Loads... they shall be shared.
One does not simply run naked into Mordor.
4Sam, finding beauty in everything
LEEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY
4He's like Fluttershy
sauron has a terrible detect hobbit skill
SHARE THE LOAD
JEEEEENKIIIIIINS!
TRI= 9999992637
They have searchlights?
-.-
Meanwhile I would never Neurotoxin you
14Dat spot light
Samwise is still best everything.
*The prediction of what the 4th chan War will be like*
Just kidding.
6So... who are Frodo and Sam?
they need to find the red key for the gate
Water...
OUT OF PONIES
work that sack
need... reaction images....
Frodo=Applebloom, Sam=Dinky
The 4th chan war shall not be like that.
OH MY GOODNESS THE STREAM IS ON
"there's a few derpy images left."
DRINK FRoDO DRINK
6Not what I meant.
This battle has tactics.
Work that shaft.
Oops.
Sams a total bro
:(
Frodo = The bearer of the one ring. Where the fuck have you been for the past 6 hours, Smeagol?
Frodo and Sam are hobbits
6I meant if this entire thing is like the battle of ponies and 4chan.
14Cue sad music
There's one tactic for all battles....CHARGE!
Exactley.
I wanna be Sam
oh right
11CrimsonRisk: Down a big hole.
4Sam is Fluttershy
And the hobbits are the 4 CMCs
inb4 the Mouth of Sauron
lol
There would be even less intelligent tactics.
Smeagol Frodo = Lauren Faust, Sam = Jayson Thiesen
ham993 no.. really?
a bromance at its finest
4That's my impression
= my favorite cut scene
its like they are all controlled by Total War AI
Let's get those Trolls!!!
Frodo = Artic Tempest
3Well I think sam is the element of Loyalty
Yes, it's true!
Good pathfinding for hobbits
A question:
I though Eowyn was Faust
3Therefore RD for me
Dman how much does that weigh now.
Who is Daniel Ingram?
and Gollum is the author of Cupcakes
What is the next movie to be livestreamed?
6And Gollum is... the writer of the fic we shall not name.
STUKAAAAA

Daniel Ingram is Merry
Death by stare!
Soarin MY TURRETS
THE STAAARE

Daniel Ingram is Pippin
HOLY FIERY VAG

Smeagol: We wont name the fic, but, completely unrelated, am I the only one hungry for cupcakes?

I fucking love sargeant Sprinkles. That guy is hilarious.
oh right, my bad ><
0love this part
who is responsible for this website?
inb4 negotiations....
I liked that moment in the game
Wait, Merry was the one who sang an impromptu song, right?
or not
Turrets have amazing orchestra skills.
Pippin was the one that sung
=_=
or yes! I was right@
LET THE LORD OF 4CHAN COME FORTH
FORRRRTH
Can Sauron come out to play?
6Define responsible, anon.
I've never met sgt sprinkles.

SUDDENLY IRISH
8crimsonrisk, y u do dis to me?
Okay.
11COME OUT AND FIGHT, BITCH!
COME AT ME BRO
Final boss of the internet
And so the small refugees of EQD face the full force of 4chan
Why did Aragorn turn Irish there?
Aragorn's sounding... irisher than usual
oh... my.......
and once again here is a example of Total War games Diplomacy
Dang, it takes way to long to login into 4chan
one does not charge into morador
is that the voice of sauron?
So Merry is Scootaloo, Pippin is Sweetie Belle, Frodo is Apple Bloom, and Samwise is Dinky?
so who's this guy in our internet war
WAIT... if the Nazgul was Moot, who could Sauron Possibly be?
Radiance, come to Pacce's drinktube sometime. He's usually there.
SHIT IT'S MOT'S PUPPET, THE CHIEF MOD

Alright i want a clean fight. No hair pulling or slapping.
0lol Marilyn Manson
8oh, that was him, crimsonrisk?
I didn't mean to, Aragorn

Sauron is the collective conscience of 4chan and the Anonymous.
She doesn't get to be a hobbit.

"Well I guess we came all this way for nothing, GREAT JOB ARAGORN."

I love how their tiny army is totally cool with letting itself get surrounded.
SONS OF GONDOR, OF ROHAN.
That does not mean I am a mindless troll.
Turret: are you still there~?
LOTRivia: The runes on the helmet worn by the Mouth of Sauron, when transliterated, say "Lammen Gorthaur". Lammen means voice, and Gorthaur, which is mentioned in the Silmarillion, means Dread Abomination, another title by which Sauron was known. The complete phrase, "Voice of the Dread Abomination", identifies the speaker as the Mouth of Sauron.
Lulzsec is on their way
Luna will save us
herospirit those are not ponies, those are horses
I beat the internet, the last guy is really hard
*drawn its gays*
I frequent /tg/, not /b/
*hit*
LOTRivia:The scene where Aragorn's army assembles in front of the Black Gate of Mordor was shot in a desert that was used by the army as a training field. Because it was still littered with mines and bombs that hadn't gone off, the army had to sweep the field with metal detectors to make the danger for the actors and extras acceptable at least.
Aha I don't think starlight is watching chat, you're correct ^_^

Gandalf_The_White: Join the hug bro!

I meant friendship
Halt the friendship, time for metal
And some say that Sam's arm grew stronger 3x that day.
This looks like a job for mr jenkins
look out for Gandalf's watch
And Sauron's eye grew three sizes that day :D
The power of love, is a curious thing
i hate my laptop with a passion
Slow mooootion
Mordor does not simply stop friendship!

PIPPIN, MERRY AND FRODO SHOULD BOW DOWN TO SAMWISE
it makes them feel tall
Bow to the four CMCs
they look like an emo band
It's 8:24 on the west coast. I imagine y'all on the east coast are exhausted by now.
Dwarves? They all up at Lonely Mountain, fighting off one of Sauron's armies.
I bet they feel embarrassed
damn...should've brought the GOOD sweatervest
3YAY SAMWISE
Frodo of the niiiiiiiiiiiine fingers
Nightshade they all died

SAMWISE IS BEST HOBBIT
this is one weird episode of Wilfred
Duskshine, it's only 11:30. :/
BOW TO SAM
7DuskShine: it's 5:24 am here
Not really DuskShine
Needs equestrian national anthem
think of how much damage a fuckin catapult would do there
HOW DO YOU THINK US EUROPEANS ARE GETTING ON?!?!?
And thus it was... the 4th age of the internet began.
3We elements of loyalty gotta stick together
and thus it was still not over.
8:23 PM
AND MAGIC
good God.
4TH AGE OF THE INTERNET

Damn they got off the volcano like 15 minutes ago
Eeyup

It's supposed to be controlled by Wormtongue, is it not?
And the 4 CMCs rode back to Sweet Apple Acres
Back to /oat/...
like a boss.
*glare*
we'd be here another hour for that
0friendship, love and magic everywhere
'sup bitches
and it only cost me a finger
no Ham
He is not impressed
Fool of a Took
y u no approve
that was the human town before there
11In the meantime: Shire folk acted as shirefolk, doing nothing special and nothing of much importance
Yo, check out that epic armour!
Big pumpkin
because friendship IS magic, that would be like saying friendship and friendship
Bree.
Blazanax lol
things will never be the same
Legolas prevented the Scouring.
WHY IS MOVIE NO END
They can't exactly have the scouring of the shire when Saruman and Wormtongue are both apparently dead, right?
small pumpkin
deep looks between all the hobbits....
Wormtongue and Sauroman should be in charge here.
this scene is so sad
oh right...
not in the shire
And they all were bored as hell
they'll never be the same
Oh and I guess this is Ending 3?
Act 3 of 4 of this movie ending.
4Partying just isn't the same anymore, you know : /
Big fight, hobbit's kick ass ... then Wormtongue kills Sauraman.
LOL
and thus Peter Jackson removed the main theme of the entire book, which COMPLETELY takes out the entire point
Well... now what?
11Must feel strange being around people your own size.
they need pinkie there to cheer em up...
DRINK TO FRIENDSHIP
"Hey, guys, let's go kill some dragons sometimes"
WHY IS EVERYONE SO SHORT
Pumpkin.
4After nearly losing our lives multiple times, singing just isn't very fun
So we saved the world....now what?
A toast to friendship
wait, what was it, ValtheJean?
the ending is halfway finished
ya score with the bar maid
Rosie!
>mfw all the hobbit's curly hair deflates.

now we have sex
Sam gained the power of self-esteem!
everything is better with Count Dooku i mean Lee
dooodoodu dooododood
HOBBIT SEKS? HOBBIT SEKS.
drinking Liquid Confidence.
Now that I've saved the world... now to get some chicks!
BUT HE HAD IT HARDER THAN YOU FAGGETS
And then Nyx shipped with Caramel.
CONCERNING HOBBITS AGAIN
You fought off a fucking spider. DO IT FAGGOT.
"BITCH. FUCK ME."
we bronies saved the internet, now what?
Dem hobbits.
You would think she would have met some one in the last year.
BUT I CAN CARRY YOU
YES!
11They made out right then and there.
SAM WINS
AWWWW YEAH
@ThePretender the scouring of the shire reiterates the main theme that even the smallest of people can do great things
YAY SAM!
That proves it, hes not gay
FUCK YES
the next morning
Look at Sam pretend he's straight
GO SAM!!!!!!!!!!!
MARRRIED IN LIKE, 5 SECONDS

4The pub immediately turned into a wedding
SAMWISE GAMGEE GETS ALL THE BITCHES
AND SO THROUGH AN EPIC CUT THEY GOT MARRIED
We don't exactly need that reiterated.
lucky guy
14I wanna go!
I mean, we all saw Samwise, Frodo, and even Gollum at the end.
And then they all fucked
The end
ah, thought as much. I dunno, I though the bowing scene got that point well enough
Sam actually goes off to be Mayor of the Shire winning dozens of reelection. He is the best hobbit
FOREVER ALONE
That was in real time
"It's okay, Sam, i want you to be happy."
congratulations, you're a woman now
FRODO - Forever alone
*tear of happiness*
Random Val rage
Frodo is gunna score some elf chicks

FUKKEN END!
HOW DO I HOLD ALL THESE OLD LIVES?

GOODBYE WE LOVE THE SHIT OUT OF YUO GANDOLF
"We have heard tell that Legolas took Gimli Gloin's son with him because of their great friendship, greater than any that has been between Elf and Dwarf. If this is true, then it is strange indeed: that a Dwarf should be willing to leave Middle-earth for any love, or that the Eldar should receive him, or that the Lords of the West should permit it. But it is said that Gimli went also out of desire to see again the bea
uty of Galadriel; and it may be that she, being mighty among the Eldar, obtained this grace for him. More cannot be said of this matter."
best ending ever
*SUPERBROHOOF*
The End :) :( :)
