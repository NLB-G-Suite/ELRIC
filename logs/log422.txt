BUFFER
43 wing beats per second
D:
ValtheJean: It's not horrible, but taken at face value it makes little sense to the rest of the series and that which it stands for. It throws former concepts out of the window and more or less solves the main issue of the game through "space magic" plus you don't find out what happens to ANYONE of the many important secondary characters or even your closest friends.
BUFFA THE VIDEO SLAYER!

Fuck buffers to hell.

Radu: not a chance in hell
Litwick: inorite
i remember this now..
lack of buffer comments is inconvenient, i cant tell if im lagging or the stream is. this is why i say "buffering" comments are useful
Seeing as how we're the only fandom that can accept "friendshipping"...
otakon: If you want, I wouldnt mind to take the shipping for you...
2,14 he was not afraid to ban, oh brave Sir ValtheRobin

"Whenever I do a parody, it's really a homage to the original song and the original artist ... Some people do parodies that are kind of mean spirited, I try to stay away from that because ... I like to keep my relationships with the song writers and the publishers and people like that and I also like to think it's more of a challenge to have fun with the song as opposed to being demeaning

everypony is a jerk in this episode
Don't you call RD a bitch, you bitch
it really doesn't help that the person who reviewed my essay didn't seem to even like weird al
This episode is so controversial...
His special talent is smoking....
This episode would be much better if the other mane 6 had actually tried to talk to RD at all.
Not Mr Waddle!
yay spiderman!
nooo save the old people!!!!
Ew.
Oh, shoot. I'm too late.
I dont like this one at all =c Being a fn of rainbow dash....
11,01Rainbow Dash is still my favorite.
i sensed a really negative personality in between the lines
HML, as much as I hate to say it, it's not the worst thing ever
It's a Spiderman parody
RainbowAsh: Then no drame.
:P
Suddenly, string of Ponyville disasters.
DERPY
yay spiderman knock offs!
oh my
Drama*
that being said, all I'm doing is IRC
lol seeing that photographer pony makes me want a Frank West pony "He's covered wars ya know." :D
05aad she's so happy
for anything actually useful it's kinda not possible
Ninjazz, I could totally see RD blowing them off.
XD
05aaw*
RD is too stuck on herself to be my favorite
drf you have experience with windows server 2008 right?
I say the same Nittany_Discord: But still.. i dont like this ep x)
slick moves
...I never thought of it that way. It's like, the only role the Mane 5 seem to have is foreshadowing for what they do for the rest of the episode.
the author of this episode got death threats for this
yes
RainbowAsh: See.
Spiderman? This is a reference to Batman: The Animated Series.
same here Airpuff. I'm not a huge fan of this
anything with DC?
...silly.
pinkie is my favorite, because shes silly
Ninjazz, it doesn't need to change anything but make the ponies likeable
Sooo, whoever voted this the worst ep of Season 2?
and the fact that Firefox can't even remember a simple preference is retarded
DC?
Deal with ti!
domain controller
inb4 kiss
DEAL WITH IT
active directory
I love the one with Daring do though..
Radu, me. Not worst episode ever, though
Deal with ti
<Twilight> Applejack, what is Rainbow Dash's ego level? <Applejack> It's over EIGHT THOUSAAAAAANNNNNND!!!
Can we just call her Danger for short?
11,01This episode was my least favorite of S2.
I've used Active Directory
but not DC
*pitchfork* Navk shippers! BACK!
^
KISS
RainbowAsh: Hmmm.
LET ME GO DASH
Kiss?
11,01Just because there was nothing special with it.
kiss
No, not the kiss!:O
that rumored kiss
I Liek Attention
"Don't use such big words around me, Dashie."
11,01Just meh.
i can't seem to get my windows 7 machine to log into my server 2008 server
so yeah x-x
(sighs):|
its an important lesson for kids tho
Rainbow Dash is attention whore
Cya, night everypony
^ Nittany_Discord
giggle at Spike
do both of them have usernames with a password?
Her Ghost Rider
as that's required
Spike`s a Ghost!
Spike's a ghost!
jinkies
Rainbow Dash is the only pony who has a bigger ego than me
nittany_discord i think secret of my excess is probably my least favorite. it just makes me cringe a bit
Don't you dare call RD a whore.
This is my least favorite episode, yet this was the new episode the first Saturday after I became a brony
Those wigs need to be real
yeah. totally not bitching around.
kk bye Nitram: =P
Actually. Isnt this like the 3rd time we watched this episode this month alone?
SPIKE'S A GHOST?!? *disconnects*
Congratulations, Spike. You're the new Rainbow Danger Dash.
Bon Bon is a RD fangirl
Radu: Wait, who did now?
sorry a bit slow, defragging
Twi's face is priceless
anyway...
well, she is a whore of attention this episode
Spike as the Ghost Rider Spirit of Friendship lol
Radu: RD is a who . . .
bye
Listen HASBRO make those wigs real and sell them!
never fear your friendly naborhood spider-woops I mean Rainbow Dash is here
I would wear that wig every day
How weird is it that I'm watching commentary of this episode? :P
i want thta autograph card
after defragging is done i'll open up the VMs
This episode nevewr made sense
She stole Twi's balloon!
Rainbow Dash: Excellent time management skills. What's wrong with that?
A little wierd DavidCortez
Radu: lesome individual in some other episodes.
10 seconds
And crashed it
a challenger appeared
11,01Purple!
BATMAN
Pinkie
The Lesson is if you're friend becomes too much of an attention whore, brutally defeat them at EVERYTHING
aim high, but not for the imposibooru -> yeah. funny
how was she faster
the dark night !
HAXXXXXX
Failure...
knight * xd
or aj
DINKY
MadSurge lol dont ya mean Bat-Mare
DINKY
DARKWING PONY
ohai dinky
"What about the OLD hero?" "TOO LATE MOVING ON"
was that AJ or PP?
*your
AJ
the mayor is totally in on it
...See why I have a problem with this one? :P
Jumping = Pinkie Pie
Pinkie Pie
I wish we'd have 10 seconds of buffering right after RD boasting about having 10 seconds to spare.
I love how the ponies forget about Rainbow Dash almost instantly
That was the MMDW
my pc is so slow i have to watch mlp on my phone
Jumping roof to roof
They just forget about Rainbow?
RD becomes supervillain.
mayor-do-well
Pinkie Pie is best free runer
well. it wasn't RD
RD over reacts.
dat jealousy
metal gear solid music?
We never find out
I love this music
hey, Sparkle Sparkle
Rainbow Dash would make an excellent supervillain. But the rainnuke would make her OP...
Hey, music reminds me of Metal Gear Solid
Music reminds me of metal gear solid
music is great
That was odd
mg music ^^
AJ
FUCK YEAH SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE
that's what I was thinking! Metal Gear
MDWAJ
NEVER FEAR. ALCATRAZ IS HERE... if only ppl understood the reference
dat spiderman rescue
Wow, ZombieBrony /)
That's what I call
Well. partly. I mean, she could rob a bank in ten seconds flat, but if she uses too much power, there won't *be* a bank. Or any bits.
my home connection seems to randomly die for a few seconds
putting the horse before the cart
The hell you doing Dash? Quit giving the speech and stop the damn wagon
YEAH SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE
why do they have that road anyway =
I`m old enough to get it Roflbot
^
Super Strenght = Applejack
And then the gears start turning...
Skateboards.
GameTaco, well, she could blow some stuff up and demand that Celestia pays her to stop
Kandarihu (\
spoils
RANSOM!
mysterious mare does well. Call her Mysterious Mare-Do-Well? seems legit
wb drf
after i'm done defragging
lol Yellowquiet good point
i'll open up the Vms
VMs
Storm_Charger: not really superstrength, but AJ does have very well developed legs from years of applebucking
Hm. But then, that would be challenging Celestia, which is pretty daring.
PP
;)
see somepony actually gets it
LOL defrag
and wait
When I first saw this episode I thought it would be awesome if MMDW was Luna
Rainbow Dash, youre not spiderman

pinkie!!!
VM?
That might be why
Toing. Toing. Toing.
haxxxxxxxx
11,01OSHA hammered down on Ponyville after this incident.
try putting Windows Server on an actual computer LOL
Nah, Luna is taller
from memory what i was coming across as a problem was the windows 7 machine was no logon servers to proess the request
man the pony community sucked that day
lol
Pinkie Sense FTW
"Must. Resist. Urge. To. PARTY."
so it's PP,AJ,PP
lol
:D
i can't
the force is strong with this one
Pinkie Mare-do-well :3
it's part of my project
for class
XD
odd
lol
well i've done it before
well I dunno, as VMs are different :/
Why do we keep watching this episode?
Who was Mare-do-well in baloon scene?
Faint
Pinkie's Pinkie sense is an interesting superpower... wait..... PINKIE PIE IS SPIDERMAN!
debris sure falls far in equestria
You do know RD, you'd be more helpful if you'd just go ahead and save them instead of announcing yourself every time
the ip settings are correct and the windows 7 machine is using the windows 8 machine as a dns server
!
DO NOT WANT
Except for the one that you *did* save.
dat face
DAT FACE
dat grow;
that face
Indeed
I love the fact that the person she saved ignores her
deep female voice colt is right
dat bgm
Radu, well, if the alicorn states are like the super sayain levels, it could still work out
DASH. AAAAHHHHH. SHE SAVED EVERY ONE OF US!
DAT FACE
*shot*
Safe.
Why Hydroelectricty?
I love Rainbow Dash, she is so attractive<3
Fixed forever
dat logic xd
You are a stupid
lolol
Wow Dash.....:|
Because Magiteck
WELL DONE
Fail.
Don't you dare call RD a stupid

Shoooo-by-doo, shoo-soo-by-doo.
Hi TDR

Hello DerpStar! (waves)

/me 11,01cues Soviet Tetris song.
nat screws stuff up
RD did a stupid
;d
or maybe it is NAT
Totally not someone she knows.
meh
HAXXXXXX
NAT is nice though
epic music
actually yeah it's NAT
I usually use NAT
IshBestPony: You must not have any cocky friends.
Twilight confirmed as OP
but I don't do networking between VMs either
This is what gave it away for me
/me plays tetris on Nittany_Discord
BEST TETSI
Ok, PURPLE AURA MAGIC. HOW THE FUCK DOES SHE NOT KNOW IT'S TWILIGHT
*TETRIS
funny thing is how this failure couldn't be blamed on Rainbow Dash, but is anyway
11,01Ahh! Blocks!
The writers screwed this episode up. They could've just telled RD to calm down
/me dances
i'll need to do more tests i guess after the defrag is done

/me TS pats herself on back
/me facehooves
Hello ponies
I'm considering getting this
I'm back
yes wwe do
maybe it was Luna, AJ, PP, TS, FS
I found it for $111 on another site SXD
-S
With a slightly more full stomach
Rarity would never brag
or something like that
mawdest
At last! Someone draws the line over spam!
ZombieBrony, this was Merryweather's debute. She never lived it down, at least with the ponychan crowds
This basically ges on all the RD fans' nerves.
/me dances
MahBoi777 Foreeeeeeeeeeever
EXCLUSIVE! Rainbow Dash is Jealous!
Sounds like Twilight's being a bitch to her friend
Spike west
dat jealousy
and this is crule
(sighs) Spike....:|
^^
Poor Merryweather
defrag done
Radu: lol no she isnt.
Mane 5 are doing exactly what they are teaching rd not to do. BRAG.
O SHE JELLY
Why is RD bothered about being a Hero
my pc is so slow i have to watch mlp on my phone
not gonna happen ^^
Ninjazz: Very much on my nerves, even to the point of hating this show.
Wish RD became a super villian here
11,01Merriweather improved with Hearth's Warming Eve.
I can watch MLP on my 3DS:3
She should team up with Dr. Adorable.
Super villain RD!
Radu: shes trying to teach dash a lesson/
EEyup
TheRainbowDash: A little sad, Dashie...
Live Action Fairly Oddparents movie foar A movie
now to load VMs
otp?
Nittany_Discord, I loved HWE and DQ.
you know
Ninjazz: Yeah, it is....
NO
NOO
That movie was terrible
*trollface*
They could've just talked to her, not bitch-slap her and making her feel awful, you know?
errr,,,
Yes
Fluffy tail.
-.- I hate this episode..
This episode made me hate RD tbh
Didn't Merryweather write Hearths warming eve
tail in a bun
HER ASS IS IRON
I hated DG and how it promote RarityxSpike
The trolling would be immense
11,01She co-wrote Putting Your Hoof Down.
TheRainbowDash: CONSIDERING the huge amount of episodes where she is showered with love...
Rainbow Dash x Granny Smith
the cronicles oh lamebow dash begin. your too awesome for this. stop it.
Granny is not amused
Radu: talking isnt as effective.
Radu: She can ALWAYS get a nice ego shaving
bitchslap? RAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Impression of RD is below 0..
And it really wasnt as bad as I thought it would be
Radu, yes. Even if RD wouldn't have listened, it would have made the characters work
O_o
dat grunting
Radu: and why do you say only twi is being bad?
Its pretty much the same as the episode with twilight.. but they just make her look so bloody bad -.-
hey Guys
after the Trixie incident, RD should have learned about boasting ;)
why does mai housekey smell like ass?
Show of power!
oh brother
And then otakon would start a threesome with them
dat voice
nomf
I has 4 play coins. I am so happeh :3
Tubs of jelly
dat bite
Dat neck crack
rofl
All of them are being bad. I just highlighted Twilight in that scene
11,01Spike didn't like being babied by Rarity, which was OOC of Spike IMO.
Oh boy, fans of different ponies are fighting.
:O PONIES?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Unicorns op
Nittany_Discord, I disliked Putting Your Hoof Down, as Fluttershy was just as one-dimensional in it as Dash is in this one.
umm...
Ninjazz: Aww yeah, those episodes definitely overshadow this one.:)
Ugh... WHY DO WE WATCH THIS EPISODE WHEN ALL IT CAUSES IS ARGUMENTS?!
Yaaay~
*tap tap tap*
Damn us not having hands!
Yes.
this is just a fun final project drf XD
heeeeeeeyyy... she stole twilights magic color!
dat neck crack. It sounded like the one from Happy Wheels
You're *always* amazing.
create a domain
Indeed purple unicorn
I'm gonna play faceraiders, and there's nothing you can do about it!
/me milks TheRainbowDash
Radu: theyre teaching rd a lesson
This episode just makes the entire mane 6 look bad
I've never *created* a domain
LAME
One does not simply mow the lawn.
SHORYUKEN
CupcakeWarrior: O_O.....what...
Radu: rd might jsut ignroe talking
attack the weebles
Talking is the key to solving things.
Nittany_Discord, I thought Spike's reaction to Rarity was in character, because it happened just when his self image as a dragon was pulled into question
Weed
WEEVILS
11,01CupcakeWarrior: Eww.
Not bitching your friends
oh great now my phone is fuckin up!!
Actually I think putting your hoof down led to great character development
11,01Mayve.
Whens Lottery?

CupcakeWarrior: Moo :3

Who cares about you.

Yes youre body is very sleek<3
But why am I all alone?:'(

11,01Same colorful picture on my flank.
I Hate Losing
DerpStar, but Fluttershy already had the whole seriousing up when necessary down by Dragonshy

Et tu Scootaloo?
Scootagrin.

whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
yes my phone works
And Sir Bufferton the 5th has arrived
DavidCortez: That'd be a shitty episode.
table for hamina?
DerpStar, true, but in older episodes she wasn't such an extreme doormat, that she couldn't even buy food.
Guys, do I have a brain made of steel? Because I've had the 3DS's 3D on for 3 hours straight and no eyesore or headache, and I can see perfectly.
Dat derp
DavidCortez: She would have blew em off.
derp face
but its not as much fun
Moar Buffering
While chasing Mare-Do-Well, a lumber yard burned down
Well.. i guess this episode isnt all bad.. she learns humility making her even more awesome than before >.>
lol so much skipping
That's impossible
...And I would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for you meddling ponies and your stupid dragon...
plot twist, you were all right, except you people who said Rarity
I think the buffer improved the scene immensely. xD
That's the point of the ending DavidCortez
A witness, kill her she knows to much
I used magic
O.o
SARREEE
'salright.
Hello everypony
you know, pinkie wasn't around for the entire episode until now
Very_Silly_Filly, what did you play?
Failed murder attempt
Saarry!!
Very_Silly_Filly: That's nothing
hmmmm
ti- uh... i mean Kicks McGee
HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?
Rarity was pretty underpowered here...
Because you're a bitch.
fly-by:THIS IS PONYVILLE, MUTHA*****
Then who saved the balloon
Hmm, okay
This episode deserves to be sucked into a void.
Knock that shit off Rainbow dash
But WHO saved the mare from the BALOON??
Played a bit of this, bit of that
and back
A LITTLE?!
When this one first aired I first thought it was Rarity due to the giant hat :3
:D
Evo_Kaer: Noone
otakon: Keep hiding.
ZombieBrony: Pinkie, I guess.
Luna was balloon hero.
true
And then Pinkie got... Carried away...
Dat Face

Chocolate cake.
DANDANDAAAAAANN

=c She learned something! =D
Totally.
Roflbot, no, A Dog and Pony Show is much worse

"It's NOT the Rainbow Dash show."
Still episode makes her look like a total bitch =c
Dat Broken Aesop
MahBoi777 what do you think of mai theory
05,15oh hai
Soooo. Can we actually not watch this again until like a month?
I fthought it was more than one of them after the construction site
YOu want some chocolate cake jammed in your face dude?!?!
Heart and hooves day was the worst imo
its because home users don't need that
Has the lottery already been made?
Yes but RainbowAsh it was demonstrating how she was being abused by anypony when she wasn't on an adventure with the Mane 6
or most don't
Lol Pinkie.

Eat the Rich foar B movie
11,0163
The suspense is killing me.

11,02Arcane_Flame
Windows 7 was an upgrade by the way

RX-78-SweetieBot: no prob, but Unfound is not back yet from The Avengers(DAMMIT I WANT TO SEE THAT MOVIE!) I wonder if it's up on Pirate Bay yet.....
11,02Apollo 18
14"so you want to install this software... how about our toolbar?" "no" "well...this downloader?" "no" "well...other crap that you'll never use and will suck your ram?" "NO"
11,01Ooh.

05,15waaaait
Hmm.
Apollo 18.
Oh thats a good movie

Apollo 18 woo
Was that the recent one?
1,3space horror flick
APOLLO 18
I'll watch that.
Hm
ohgod
Oh, I kinda liked that.
11,02Bit of a low score at 5.3/10
Meanwhile I think so, isn't it the one with the moon?
I WANTED TO SEE THAT MOVIE BUT FORGOT TO
that one is schlock
05,1525% on Rotten Tomatoes
11,01About a secret mission to the moon gone wrong.
Inb4 a million luna jokes during that movie
I've heard it got bad review
2,14 you sure that wasn't his B movie pick?
04May have make it B
04*to make
man, pick another!
Budget was only $5m
So pretty low for 2011
it got 25% and a 5.3 for gods sake!
2,14 what was his entry for B movie?
05,15low budget, low rating
movie reviewers are idiots anyway
ouch
Hm. May be a repick.
2,14 he might have swapped them by accident
11,02lunopolis was his/her b movie
low budget, low rating PASS!
hmm
04The fuck is Lunopolis?
netlogon server is stopped
and won't start
seems legit
11,01Luna would know =p
the hell is Lunopolis?
6.2 IMDb
11,01It's probably on the moon.
I think it would be awesome to be a bronystate mod
wonder if the movies gunna get tossed
even I have never heard of that one
Fuck if I know
But I want to see Apollo 18
05,15"When two documentary filmmakers find evidence of a hidden base on the moon, they quickly become entangled in uncovering a secret history of earth that was meant to be long forgotten. "
Moon madness there
no idea
do i need to activate windows 7?
spaaaaaaaace
no idea
11,01I was half-right.
RX-78-SweetieBot: nope, doesn't fit the criteria sorry man
low budget, low ratings=not being shown
What song is this?
Or is it the same song?
It's from Civilization III
hell the B movie is rated better
11,02alright, since it is neither a really good movie nor a high budget one, we'll reroll for another A Movie
please activate x-x
dat repick
11,01Aww.
i've used the key already so
Reroll, as I suspected.
Sweet, reroll.
11,02156!

YAY! We haven't had a reroll in months I think

There is still a chance!

11,01Probably better than Apollo 18, but not A.
UHF?
Not an A apparently.
What's his B movie pick?

11,02Their B Movie was Clue

Meanwhile: Weird Al movie
UHF rings a bell for me...
05,15which we can't stream again
11,01Already shown.
1,3which is ineligible
11,01And too soon.
And they picked Clue as the B movie. Again,.

04Just show the OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD part
11,022.4/10
AWESOME
11,01!
04And there you have it
11,011
04Troll 2
You do realize that it will be IMMEDIATELY WMC'd right?
inafter OH MY GOOOOOOOD spam
11,02Alright, pony episodes...
Just loop that clip for an hour
2.4!?
Jesus...
04That's the only thing anybody knows from that film
That film sucks
troll 1 got like a 1.8 i think
there one of them finally shut down, now only running 3
Horribly.
This will be the first and LAST time Troll 2 is shown
low
kenne: actually the first troll wasn't too bad
Nah, WMC is for stuff that's both bad and not entertaining.
11,01I might not even know that part.
And it should be lower than 2.4, but people ironically vote it up
11,02Number 127: pikorar
11,02Fall Weather Friends
LordDerpington: yeah, but Troll 2 IS bad and unentertaining
11,01Hasn't been shown in a while.
doesn't even deserve to be called Troll 2
otakon: YOU CAN'T PISS ON HOSPITALITY]
YEAH
3nice
but think of it this way drf, would you like to be able to back up your data in one fell swoop in case your internal hard drive crashed?
nvm its 3.8
ScootaChicken: lol
kenne: no, Troll 1 (which is completely unrelated to Troll 2) is a much better film
3I haven't seen that one in months
or have some extra storage without breaking out the screwdriver?
11,02165: DSNesmith
1,3nah, we can't have that pick, it makes pikorar happy, and that's not allowed
It's still bad, but much better than Troll 2
Midnight_Fyre: thank you, the story is more coherent and the FX ar better
11,02Sisterhooves Social
3also nice :)
11,01OK.
It's better than Troll 2, but less entertaining than Troll 2.
11,02That's all for the lottery today ponies!
11,01We'll take this as our next movie pick.
lol pikorars not allowed to be happy
Yeesh, that was an ordeal.
1,3A Movie: The Silence of the Lambs - derpy_pony
1,3B Movie: Troll 2 - LucidDream
1,3Pony 1: Fall Weather Friends - pikorar
1,3Pony 2: Sisterhooves Social - DSNesmith
otakon: plus it has a character named Harry Potter who defeats an evil being with magic :)
11,02Stay tuned for a special event, an interview with Babble with Bronies!
ScootaChicken: Troll 2 is a bad film and you should fell bad.
Who's pikorars?
Midnight_Fyre: this was BEFORE teh books by teh way
otakon: The Room is also a bad film, but we all love it.
A MOD DIDNT WIN
WAY before the books
yep
Eat the Rich foar B movie
ScootaChicken: I hated that "movie" with a passion
now time for the interview thingy
otakon: But they're both incredibly entertaining.
They epitomise the phrase 'so bad it's good'
Ponies.
+m over?
Scoot Scoot scoota-bell
Bummer you didn't get to me the way A-movies were falling
FINALLY, I can talk now! God, I was so tempted to make so many silly comments during your lottery. -_-
now im just waitiing for the crow to get picked for A movie
/me hugs SuperBrony64
Where was Gondor when this lottery was so very much like the early days I actually got nostalgic?
Sisterhooves Social FTW
HELLO EVERYONE
That was just ridiculous
/me hugs Kipkat07_Mare
Aanndd we're back
4 FUCKING TIMES. Holy crap people do not know how A movies work.
Oh hai CrimsonPhoenix
hey
were back :)
/me noms SuperBrony64's mane
My god, that was the SILLIEST roll ever
^
Can we switch to LimeV now?
I'll get B Movie one day! *evil laugh*
Anypony find the pony referance in the Aquabats yet?]
RAWRity: Ask yourself that question.
omg omg movies yay!
Competition week-end next
Is The Crow A?
Thank you for *not* choosing Appolo18 - it _sucks_.
Dat 4th roll :D
was a shame apollo 18 wasn't shown
I'm excited :D
so...ehhh. how does the lottery work?
I think we need a Bronystate guide to A movies. Since there seems to be some confusion.
hang on...
Good thing I'm not signed up
I liked apollo 18
Meanwhile: I wasn't asking a question
Hmm... borderline.
we decided no apollo 18.. but we got troll 2?
troll 2 ftw
Interview Time
and I cried when you turned down zombieland
http://i.imgur.com/vGp2t.jpg
ouuu
05,15FillyFlam check our FAQ
SuperBrony64: soooooooooooo many rerolls. the intermission ended before B pick :D
Roflbot: Oh my goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
Roflbot: Troll 2 was in the right category
I chose Pirates of the Carribean for the A movie myself
All you need to do is IMDb your film
I always thought of it as a cult film
Check rating and budget
1,3imdb > 7.0 or rotten tomatoes > 80%
thres a difference between APOLLO 18 and APOLLO 13, they're not the same movie
RAWRity: Oh, my bad. It looked like a question.
should I get Graffiti Burger or HoundDogs pizza
Yeah, that's kind of hypocrtical. We say no to Apollo, yet we get Troll 2.
. 1 B, avoids confusion...:/
I chose Bat 1989man
Midnight_Fyre: should be
/me hugs RAWRity.
Apollo 13 was about the miracle that happened with the astronauts
05,15Litwick nope. because Troll 2 was in the right catagory
We get trolled?
Litwick, there are different rules for A and B
!pokemon
Meanwhile: don't let trixie see. She might get jealous
B movie
Alright, good night everyone c:
If i nominated The
Troll2 was only picked for that stupid fucking like, I know it.
Night Radu
D:
IshBestPony: Do you live in Columbus?
line*
Gnight Radu
If i nominated The Matrix For B movie.... would it get turned down????????????
Midnight_Fyre yesh
13yes
they should just show two movies, instead of 1 A and one B...distinction seems silly to me
Night Radu don't let NMM or Molestia bite
Midnight_Fyre are you a spy
Roflbot: yep
13because the matrix is an a movie
The problem with Apollo 18 is that it's not really good, or so bad you can make fun of it.... it's just Meh.
pizzaaaaaaa
Knew it! :D
hey kirzstryfe zombies/
fine The Matrix Revolution it is
Wait, columbus Ohio?
Go for the Hound Dog's
Midnight_Fyre: budget of 15M and rating of 7.5 seems like it to me
Problem, Mr. Anderson?
What would Robin hood men in tights be?
/me dances
great
13which based on budget and return is also A
DrGNs: B. and we've showed it before
so these two computers work
11,01The Matrix is definite A.
I used to go to OSU, so I lived in Columbus for a while. Now I'm up near Cleveland
IshBestPony: Columbus, Ohio?
05,15DrGNs probably B
so it's something i'm forgetting
11,01Sequels less so.
yes RX
What about the Matrix Revolution?
it never made sense
Imma leave it here tonight everypony, see you all tomorrow!
Well shit, Im just over in Hilliard
hiii
I think I may have found a new B movie to vote for.
3We haven't shown men in tights before RAWRity
Nittany_Discord: No, they're still definitely A movies. Budgets were HUGE
Which is tragic because my old one hasn't been shown yet.
bye DasPinkie
Bye DasPinkie
Waterworld had a huge budget. :P
I have such a B movie. I ain't changing votes until it gets shown.
?
What a dilema.
13like back to the future, matrix 2 and 3 only work together as one film
Did either of you go to the meetup in Cleveland a month or so ago?
13on their own the plot is fractured
hiiii~
05,15what are your two picks?
RAWRity: huge budget does NOT just qualify for a A movie, Apollo 18 had low budget AND low ratings, it's Z tier.
02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
Havent gotten around to looking at local meetups yet
Voting Troll 2 for Z tier.
05,15A is budget AND ratings
otakon: I'm talking about the matrix sequels
hopefully i get picked sometime in the future :3
Silent Hill?
I would vote for Braindead, but I don't know where it is
i picked the movie "red"\
I don't want to name this new one, but the old one...Grr. I've been tight lipped aboutthat one as well.
troll 2 will be good fodder for parody
RED is a great movie
hm... how did Titanic 2 never become WMC
RAWRity: oh, well I guess.......The Matrix is way better then the last two movies though
05,15Dead Alive/Brain Dead would be a B
Well, I saw what I came for. Goodbye everypony!
You have to say one of them Meanwhile
Mahboi777 IKR?
I hope we soon get Zombie Ponies
13matrix 3 enjoys a 6.5 on IMDB, which is higher than some As we've shown
the bakery I work at had me go to an autism fundraiser last night to give outs samples, lots of rich ponies there, and in my head I was playing fun games such as: Spot the Plastic Surgery, Botox or Notox, and my favorite, Real or Fake: Booby Edition
MahBoi777: it IS! my GOD RED is a great movie
Cause Titanic 2 was a blast to MST3K
We haven't really seen a lot of animated films picked for the Movie Night so far.
intermissions over again
For the past year I have kept the title of my B movie a secret, but now that I might swap it...
RED is an amazng movie!
Shizuschlafen: how you been today dear?
Shizuschlafen: I agree 100% I can't only watch BTTF 1 without watching 2 and 3. That's why I hope it never gets picked for movie night,
Then it will be my B movie choice fluttercry
YES
what movies won?
I'd vote for "The Moon", but i'm not sure which category it belongs too.
That was the first one I went to, and probably the only one I will for a long time since I can't really travel too far in my current financial situation
Silence of the Lambs and Troll 2
11,02ALright, give us a few min
Prepare your emulators bronies... We're in for a long movie
that feel when my movie renderer has been on 99% for 2½ hours...
Just how long?...
=/
and now for....the b movie...."shivers"
PrincessDismo: email bronystate and ask that we have a trilogy night once a week during the dry pony free summer
JoseEnriquez i is playing my chrono trigger
clop clop clop
I'd propose Amadeus
everypony..... run.
0____0
this B movie is so weird
What movie are we in for?
Heh, thats largely why I havent gone looking for any meetups yet Midnight_Fyre
this movie is actually very good
Run from this film.
It's not that it's long.... it's just that it's so terrible it feels long
Renard: oh thats a good one, i thought of proposing that too
twilight_sprinkle: Slither is good, isn't SHivers about the parasites that make you a sex fiend?
I could stare at this pic forEVER. :)
Mahboi777 RED is one of the very FEW movies where humor and action mix really well, know what i mean?
what's the flic?
wingboner
05,15I really like her.....mane
Next movie is supposedly good...yet shown as B..:/
Is that?...
I could stare at this pic forEVER.
and native German speakers will love it
well not that terrible but entertaining enough to kill time
Is that?...
I remember when someone drew that on stream... I think
fluttercry: What would a film with a really high budget but a really low rating be?
SB?
otakon: .....what
90's horror flic about a detective
Or vice versa?
The pacing is just so SLOW. If the pacing was a little faster I wouldn't mind but.... good CELESTIA.
twilight_sprinkle: you never seen Slither?
Actually vice versa would probably be a B
Hmm. What's the lowest "high" rating for a film on imdb?
05,15pony_4588 it's BORING
ScootaChicken, Twilight
Any chance someone saved all of Ghosties's chapter titles from last night??
otakon: no
We should stream Titanic 2 again.
Can't afford a hotel room, and I won't share one with a bunch of people who stay up partying until 5:00 am because I'll never sleep and my car is junk, so I don't trust myself to drive it far
twilight_sprinkle: squick horror movie witha bit of comedy
ScootaChicken: a waste of money
Im not easily bored
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068182/ b movie
Derpy_Hooves: yes, it's one of the few awesome action movies out there
laggy
if the movie is any good
otakon: havent seen it
twilight_sprinkle: it's a little slow but has high gross out factor
RainbowAsh: I'm asking for A and B categorisations.
I'd rather watch the Gen 1 MLP movie than Aguille again.
Ya how did Aquire be a B movie with 8.1????????????????
pony_4588: oh you will be....YOU WILL BE
MOD LOGIC
(mostly because I want to vote for Twilight but I'm not sure which category to put it in)
Roflbot: it's a cult film and ValtheJean's pick.
You didn't just read that.
Napolean Dynamite has to be an A
2,14 rating isn't everything
well see :)
so..
That's totally not my evil plan.
thats lies
im surprised nobody is voting Harry Potter 7 part 2
Was playing L4D2, we all ragequit'd
2,14 and besides, when you desire to claw your eyes out of boredom, then you'll understand
It buffered again. I'd recommend switching to another stream source so that way these ponies can suffer through every moment of it :)
Roflbot: it's REALLY a damn eccestation(I cna't spleel today)
o.o
I really don't get why Aguire was supposed to be a good movie, definitely must've missed something
Great, german movie .__.
Litwick: they are setting up
That's why chat is here... Right?
i dont know if i should refresh or unpause this picture
=/
and now time for Fairly OddParents
sooooo
Ninjazz: Ghosties kept us going last night with his chapters
now I want to see the movie RED again, lol
this B movie has an 8.1
Caillin u still there
/me will get graffiti burger
yay watching children's cartoons at 21 :P
the circle of buffering
Gah ffs I can't find a budget on this movie.
Chapter 1: THE BUFFER CIRCLE!
Now I'm interested.
Chapters of what?
Oh.
hm... is it playing? i'm buffering round and round
:D
How'm I supposed to know whether it's A or B?!
I'm suprised no one got a number for Harry Potter
So... is there anything going to happen now?
Will u help us agains Ghosties?
Meanwhile: it's a B for sure
pony_300: It's the sort of movie you need to devote all of your attention to. It can't really be appreciated in a chat setting
I just noticed the N64 controller-Cute Mark... could be my Cute-mark :/
Meanwhile: its a damn speech is what it is
Not the one showing, this one I found while looking for a new movie
Spell-of-Gaming: "thats what i said ya crazy cunt hehehe"
Meanwhile: what is it?
Can't say.
Original NES controller cutie mark is superior. :P
where da stream at?
Ehhh. Harry Potter is too mainstream.
Meanwhile: then HOW can I help you find out if it's A or B then?
im going to nominate Twilight as a B movie
NO ONE CAN HELP ME.
IshBestPony: they are setting it up
twilight_sprinkle: :P
Ninjazz = hipster
and ill pick the LONGEST one
brb need more noms
hahahahahha
i still havent seen harry potter 7 part 2
TWILIGHT??!?!?!?!!?!??!?!?
Arcade-style joystick
/me listened to DRF's show the other night :P
as did I
/me puts on glasses
Roflbot, be careful, though. I heard the last one was partially watchable
04Probably not, that B movie took the most out of me
otakon x nom
nice
did you like it?
10I recognized all the songs pretty much
awww
hahaha 5.3 AND PPL STILL WATCH THE SERIES
10Yrp
s
10Yep*
Twilight is not a B Movie, it's a S-movie --> Suicide movie
yay XD
will there be a movie?
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1099212/
dance music is unusual on the radio
Ghosties: Chapter 101: The re-run
Sooo is B movie worth it or not?
ni
which is exactly why I'm doing it
no no no
Evo_Kaer: i agree
Oi! Twilight is pony, not an terrible movie.
Twilight is an R movie, as in Rifftrax movie
you might be filling a niche
Starflash I heard not
Yes
I wonder...this could probably pass as an A movie.
this is why some people like college radio
I could have my cake AND eat it.
niche formats
wat happenned to the stream?
I didn't know the lottery was this early, because it's around 3:00 am in my place
where did it get its high rating from :T
Someone should request Twilight JUST to troll us.
the problem is going to be getting enough songs for the upcoming weeks
I have enough for next week but that's about all the music I have
05,15We're setting up for the interview mentioned in the newsletter that you should all know about
eat the rich foar B movie
/me dances
I qwonder if the mods would take it
Great Now you gave them ideas
YES, INTERVIEW!
fluttercry: oh
oh
....question is it buffering for others?
wait, so no B movie?
yay
thats wat i was waiting for .. so cool
yeah
interview?
it's still setting up
Shamroc for everypony
Litwick: and if they do (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻) table will be flipped
ahh
otakon x Shamroc
wow no B movie, you eurobronies are lucky
Not sure if I should stay for it... I *had* plans for today. Hm.
IshBestPony...wat?
finally
i think success
Indeed they are
Of course, I haven't watched a single thing on here all day, I'd rather chat.
I'm going out in an hour anyway
ValtheJean: If you want to claw your eyes out from boredom check out Silent Light. It's much slower than Aguirre, a lot less happens, it doesn't even have an interesting setting, and it's almost an hour longer
oh it's the interview THEN the B movie
WHAT?! No B Movie? I want to see Klaus Kinski!
mips.tv sucks.
Yeah.
then otakon sexy tiem
I was looking forward to this :/
IshBestPony: what?
i got the welcome to <domain> window
what is this interview?
Guys, dont refresh the page.
otakon x everypony
otakon...just now heard of the interview like 4 minutes ago from kirz....
the B movie sucked
That B movie was awesome
At least thanks to sticking around I can finally cross Monty Python and the Holy Grail off my to-do list.
i cant refresh
that was that bad of a movie
Roflbot, you can. It just doesn't help
I didn't see the ending of Holy Grail
the stream is giving me a Website offline :/
ive seen worse *cough twlight
Next on my list... Krull?
lil same
Ninjazz: They get arrested. THE END
Shane377: At least stuff happens in Twilight.
KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHN
Same here
MadSurge: :O
Yep.
And then the website crashes
eek
Not kidding
its for historians maybe
:O
must not press f5!
it seemed realistic, but not something for this place
And then the movie trolls you with organ music :D
You guys are scaring me... Is the B movie THAT bad? It got an 8.2
Yes.
FillyFlam: http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/demotivational-posters-one-of-these-is-incredibly-gay.jpg
Ninjazz: its what i said
05,15Ninjazz it's REALLY REALLY BORING
Ninjazz: It sucks. IT really sucks.
Ninjazz, it's boring
It sucks like a black hole with a smoothee
What sucks?
Sounds boooring
02I liked it. Didn't have to listen to the same songs you everyday
Ninjazz: not for ordinary audiences, its for people interested in history
the chat was way more entertaining
Im going to need ALOOOOOOOOT of coffee...
wonder why the site downed
Ghosties looks inactive. I pray for your souls during the showing of this movie
FaithHeart: it almost allways is
Without wanting to sound arrogant...it just might be that this here is the wrong crowd for this kind of movie..:/
Ninjazz: it was sort of like a representatino of conquistador raids
Ninjazz: It's one of the best films ever shown on Bronystate. I'm serious
Screw it, I'm trying that movie I found as A next time.
02hear*
oh godammit
05,15twilight_sprinkle I'm going to college FOR history, and I still hated it
lol
I think the site is down
For now though, I require tea. My dapperness levels are low.
pony_4588: thats what i said
pony_4588: I think you are right
I collect movies and this movie was on my to- do..i was thrilled when I saw they streamed it here^^
otakon: yeppers
Ehhh.
Meanwhile: you are at 50% dapper atm?
Midnight_Fyre: Why did you like it?
I assume the homepage is being updated? It shows an error that says 'The website is online'
Hmm, I refreshed and I got an error page from Cloudflare.
That counts as low.
So am I the only one whose stream is buffering?
Ninjazz 1/3 of the budget got spent just on Klaus Kinski, the crew almost starved during the producton, if the natives hadn't helped them
Website currently unavailable
I can't go below 50% because of the moustache.
Mine is too
I might do some early 2000s stuff too, as those were still great XD
like ATC - Around the World
fluttercry: well its also about movie taste of course
Lil_B: Holy crap...
same here Kandarihu
not mine lol
was my favorite song for a long itme
I*Time
Now I am scared...
And of course Meanwhile likes tea
FaithHeart, they are setting stuff up. I guess this could take a bit longer
/me dances on buffer
okay
ah i see
What u got IcryAlot ?
thanks RainbowAsh
hmm... refresh isn't working..... is God trying to save us from The Wrath of Aguirre?
I assume it's being updated for the news
fluttercry: maybe you dont like slow movies like that, some people do, just like classical literature is "slow" compareed to modern adventure stuff
pony_300: ROFL
i like tea CupcakeWarrior
CupcakeWarrior: he IS British
02you should also do some stuff by UB40
I like tea too, but cold
11,02HANG IN THERE EVERYPONY! :>
Obsidian; the buffering wheel
stereotypes ftw
yeah, one of my friends suggested that
I drink coffee.
Ninjazz: Hard to say exactly why I like a movie. Actually I had seen it a few times before last night. It's beautiffully shot, has interesting characters and an interesting setting. The premise is decent. Hard to really put my finger on it
Lots of it.
This website is offline
hence why I made a thread for suggestions :P
can do
i drink water
oh dammit
I need a 1.5 mbps download speed
and milk
I can't hold on! I don't gots no thumbs!
i cant! my ha- hooves are slipping!
spin spin spin the wheel of destiny
Water?
02XD
IS THE STREAM READY YET?!!
Randomnerd: I like coffee too, I drink alot of it
/me hangs in there on SuperBrony64 s head
IshBestPony: no, the site is down atm too.
its THE RING
Midnight_Fyre: Over all. You just don't know.
That would be a good after-birthday present :P
Bah, I only drink that when it's ot and run through coffee grounds.
THE SYSTEM IS DOWN
Ninjazz they litterely went deep into the jungle and shot that movie no matter what XD, aslo the director needed a lot of monkeys for a scene, so he went into a town and claimed to be a animal doctor
/me probably has a heart attack brewing.
the star of the show is not ready for an interview yet
I drink water
I don't normally ship ponies, but when I do, it's with otakon
Lil_B: You're kidding... :O
I like a cold glass of water
It's an art film. Imagine watching something like 2001: A Space Odyssey here. It would be hard to appreciate a film like that in this setting even though it is considered a masterpiece
oh goddammit what have I done
like i said, its not an action movie for average audiences, its a movie for specific audiences
inb4
True...
otakon x cold glass of water
SEE?!
The best part about the movies was someone quoting behind the scenes facts and trivia
funny
space odyssey <3
HAL 9000?
we need a psychiatrist and a jar of japaleno pepper
Midnight_Fyre: ah ive seen that movie and read the book, it was nice, although the movie is kidna slow
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l7g76Mx2_cg/TcZLUiHpwZI/AAAAAAAAEPs/YFD3fiNnK7w/s1600/whylauren.png
otakon x IshBestPony
pony_300: unfortunately, I used up most of my fun facts last night
otakon x Bronysith
How did i just learn this. ._.
lol good inb4, otakon
Most of them I got by watching the director's commentary
Vinyl: thats season 1
oh dear GOD stop shipping me with every conceivable thing!
Ninjazz you are german right? or is my memory wrong?
Honest to god, the facts about the movie's production are more interesting than the movie itself.
02you should play nothing but JB. See how long everyone last :'D
Vinyl, saddest brony-related event ever. Still, the series held up fine without her
internet derp ugh
otakon x mare do well
/me picks up DeathStar and hugs her
11,02i liek poniez ^-^
great, so Midnight's facts is burnt out, and Ghosties is gone.... well, enjoy your Hell, ladies and gentlemen.
otakon sorry, rule of the latest newsletter
twilight_sprinkle if you read the whole thing she isn't working on it anymore. I just learned that. posted a while ago.
/me hugs SuperBrony64 back "so do I"
04NEVER
otakon x conceptions?
Flare is back, back again.
Me too
04I SHALL NEVER LEAVE
RainbowAsh you can see the difference though :P
11,02DAT
11,02GHOSTIES
otakon you have a bad habit of getting shipped with everything that moves
RainbowAsh, at least she's doing other new stuff :)
otakon x otakon
Not animation wise, though,
I can't see the stream
00,10Hi all, how life the universe and everypony?

Ghosties: forever a lerk
Litwick refresh
Good Sumica
About to be dreadful, Sumi.
otakon x his hand
I've refreshed like 5 times so far
Hi Sumica!
Ninjazz ok, then it was someone else XD, also an other weird fact, the director STOLE the camera for to make the movie
Oh hai Sumica, it's not good
I already said that earlier
Is anything playing?
"this website is offline"
What the hoof is goin on here...
No Midnight_Fyre
hi Sumica
boring
Lil_B: NO WAY! :D
otakon x both hands

00,10oh dear sound srs

/me returns with tea.
We shipping otakon some more?
i got buffering circle of doom
otakon x Meanwhile's tea
tea time is best time
What the hell is 12 days with no computer? Are you kidding me?
Vinyl, I am not sure, actually. I mean s2 is different in some ways, but then again series usually develop over time. I find it hard to lay my finger on what exactly would have been different with her onboard.
I have no idea...
Ninjazz: He took it from his art school. He was in his late 20s when he made this movie
/me does 12 backflips into the chat
I'd like some coffee
i heard shipping
/me bonks IshBestPony with a cinderblock.
who started the whole shipping otakon thing?
see?
Leave my tea alone.
MahBoi777: no idea

This movie's got quite the history!

Ninjazz, are you talking about the B movie?
Yes.
you guys. Shizuka x Vivi ist only ship
Woah... just got back...the website is offline?
deal with it
otakon lolololololol
Ninjazz, now I am looking forward to it.
The director's commentary was fascinating. The production was an adventure itself
But otakon, it had enough milk already :(
lol
you DO realize that the love calculator NEVER works right on embedded chat right?
i just refrshed. now it says site offline. what did i miss while iw as away?
13Hi folks.

Well at least we weren't streaming ponies episodes

Dude for fucks sake
13This is not an attack.
Don't imply that there is jizz in my drink

Moving hastily onwards.
NOW MOVING ON
yeah otakon, don't be putting your special milk in ponies's tea
Ninjazz at some point, high water swept the majority of the crews rafts away... he managed to make that somehow part of the movie
otakon: Ooh, okay

I saw the Nostalgia Critic review of BIT
Sumica: The Sure for Insanity?
the 2mbps up was only because we had it before
I think
00,10there is a movie that is 10days long
*Cure
I really want the 30mbps down, 3mbps up
Bronystates true mission: To find some of the worst movies and add them to a list, so that they can better humanity through the warnings on this list.
holy fuck
but that costs a bit more
what's it called?
Yes, It's called The Cure for Insomnia
and they'd have to physically replace our modem
and my parents would obviously have to find out then :P
Sumica: We lost people during Babes in Toyland, are you trying to cause chat genocide?
a 10 day film, were they on crack, AND acid?
LordCelestia x Drying pan
02yeah
I said insanity before didn't I?
"Not really following any standard plot structure, the film mostly consists of poet L.D. Groban reciting his own poem of 4,080 pages, inter-spliced with X-rated film footage and rock music videos."
It are third best ship
Wow.
I'm suprised no one is voting for Scott Pilgrim in BMN

Must draw Bronysith as a pony wearing that hat :3
Everlasting joy nice smile
was that a facepalm there?
2,14 why does everyone think I didn't? I said "Didn't they already reference it?"
ValtheJean: its hard to hear atm
It was hard to hear, Val
Nooo that hat is gone
00,10Sorry between echo from Dari and bronysmith being quite I could not hear you clearly
Giggle at the ghosties. :3
00,10.....uhhhhhhhhhh
=/
She is better than Boba
inb4 Derpy Hooves fanart with her a Boba Fett
yay i got mentioned
*as
IT WAS A TRAVESTY!
00,10Gonna go out on a limb and say he realy likes starwars
Bronysith: did i just get ignored....
Trololo.
I dunno, that might be a stretch...
Bronysith: didnt...mention ME?
Well Tabitha didnt know she was voicinga female pony
hey criken ur a chikn
Spike x Rarity = OTP
Obsidian: yeah, she though Derpy was a boy at first, but that's besides the point. I still think the voice fit the first time
Fuck yeah, shoutout
fcanon ships are best ships
ValtheJean, master of shipping
*canon
Everlasting_Joy, Shipping, GET OTAKON IN HERE
/me dances
What is your opinion on otakon shipping?
00,10I used to ship ponies but I just cant stand the sad looks they give me when I tape up the box
11,01Val only ships with Caramel.
NO DAMMIT DON'T YOU DARE FRIGGIN ASK THAT!
11,01=p
Nooooooo Ghosties
;)
Sumica: ikr? :(
aka bow chikka wow woo
yay
Hahaha
lol
i am alive
I'm very interested in shipping myself. I mean, a parcel from across town takes three days, but I can get the same stuff shipped from hong kong in only two. How does that work?! ...nowait, what are we talking about?
3 Chats. One BronyJenkins. Buck, yes.
Val despises fan EVERYTHING
I like otakon shipping
For good reason
I dont blame him.
we know
xles: :D
wat
Noooooooo
00,10val noooooooooooooooooooooo
NOOOOO GOD NOOOO
FUCK NO
no
Bad Val Bad
epic NO
I think it is safe to say, nopony agrees.
otakon x spike
Well, in Val's defence, Spike IS a baby dragon, and Sweetie Belle IS a filly.
and the questions take a turn for the squicky.
11,02Sweetie Belle and Spike would be so cute together /)^3^(\
note he doesnt say no to this
00,10no no Val was the one that went nooooooooooooooooooo
he must like the idea
^
Great now i need to scrub my brain
They would cease to be the CMC if they get their cutie marks
I agree, SB.
Kammerjunk: well, he's a "baby" dragon but he's closer in mentality to a 10 year old I'd say, Sweetie the same
otakon: Yes, exactly.
Season 3 finale: Wrap up all the sideplots in 22 minutes. GO
I think the CMC will get a blank slate as their marks, because they have infinite potential.
Good points made.
SuperBrony64: well they WERE dancing together at the end of S2 finale
tabula rasa
I drew Bronysith as a pony. Not sur eim me hoofsta
It's Friday Friday, gotta get down Friday.
Obviously, dragons, being a different species and all, don't have the same lifespan as a pony. I assume they have a much longer life expectancy.
no
Biglaw ty man
i was AWAY

Bored? I'm mesmerized
Kipkat07_Mare: Hahaha, I'm a silly filly!:D
those paddles do nothing
I am also nearly about to pass out. So either way. It works the same way.
IshBestPony: It never is, it never stops being boring.
I think I'd prefer the old My Little Pony film to this...
That doesn't look save
I don't mind if there's no explosion, but seriously, i've seen it yesterday, it's incredibly boring, nothing happens, and it even tranforms into some sort of pathetic comedy at the end :p
Everlasting_Joy sparkle sparkle sparkle
Wie is everyone?
Oi. The MLP movie is awesome.
It can't stop being boring if it never starts being boring
you know guys, you don't have to watch it. no one makes you stay here. so stop with the "boring", it's getting annoying
TIREK FTW
IshBestPony: F*** yeah sparkle sparkle sparkile!

/me dances on raft
TheRainbowDash: I am bored. Wanna play Obsidian's drinking game? Take a shot of cider every time youre bored.
Midnight_Fyre: looks like a good thing i missed that
Aguirre: Wrath of Aguirre
otakon: I'm almost done, calm your tits.
Okay....instead take a shot whenever it gets exciting. I gurantee you wont pass out!
why don't you try HELPING THE ROWERS!
All this needs now are Sea Ponies
such emotion
RX-78|FireEmblem: my tits are NEVER calm
*aguirre: wrath of god
Kipkat07_Mare, that game already exists. It's called alcoholism
Obsidian: I like the old rules better
Dark_Horst: Imagine the complaining now multiplied several times
LoL just got here

oh boy
It started buffering right after they started talking
spoiler: theres gonna be more walking and swimming
Kipkat07_Mare: Umm, sure. I'm bored.
and some talking
RainbowAsh: Eh, best start young
lol maybe someone stole that dragon's Mooustache again
Yesterday was fun, the complaining (and mostly ghosties) made it very fun
????
I didn't think val would decide to troll us AGAIN though
What exactly did Ghosties do?
ooooh, he mean
TheRainbowDash: heres your barrel *hands you a barrel of cider*
Narolas: I agree
I'll admit, Ghosties was entertaining
Kipkat07_Mare: Ok then...
He was commenting the movie with very funny remarks
Did anyone see that Cadance eating corn video?
Midnight_Fyre sparkle sparkle sparkle
Dashie... Don't do it.
/me drinks the entire barrel and passes out
Kipkat07_Mare: I will need 6 barrels of cider after this movie is done.:D
Litwick: yes it' strangely funny
Fuck yeah, sparkle sparkle sparkle
Does anyone know any of the character's names. Besides the title character?

Obsidian: blonde guy one, lalalala guy
May I have a link, Everlasting_Joy?
hi Ran ^^
hey Golakka
Yep, just a sec.

/me drops a key to the cider cellar as she passes out from alcohol and boredom
hello Golakka
German
ah
hey Golakka hows your day been
Dont forget the flute guy
Darkts3: at a guess it's danish or german
I mean, this movie isn't the worst, and i don't mind it being long or without "splosions and action scenes", it's just bad, especially near the end, it becomes funny because of the way it's filmed
how risque showin your neck like that
Outstanding! Tickets just went on sale for http://www.bronyuk.org/
Dat face
everything is brilliant!
Personally, the movie may be boring but it is strangely entertaining.
It was originally filmed in English because that was a common language of the international cast, but later dubbed in German
(picks up the key that Kipkat07_Mare dropped, and just stares at it for 5 minutes)
Narolas: one word monkies
SuperBrony64: pm
But hey, watching bad movies is fun, i find it entertaining
Midnight_Fyre: WHERE THE HELL IS THE ORIGINAL ENGLISH ONE!?
the thing is we've experienced so many action scenes and explosions in movies nowadays
TheRainbowDash can i have some cide
What on earth is this film?
when talking to other people about it
Golakka: Good to hear then! I'm doing well too!:)
we're not used to this
i'm quite surprised at how many people can't identify the basic european languages. is it always like this?
No.
alexxm: Sure, have a cup! (hands you a cup of cider)
I understand every language. I just can't speak it.
THUNDER
PONY
I can identify most euro language
THUNDER
They dead
PONY
/me drinks TheRainbowDash s cider thanks
/me dances
/me wakes up and stumbles over to the cellar and falls down the stairs
alexxm: You're welcome.
otakon: The English one is terrible quality. Although English was the common language among the actors, they couldn't really speak it well, so it sounds terrible
SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE
Midnight_Fyre: oh
I personally am a fan of a lot of psychological movies, i'm used to long movies that are considered boring ... this one is just terribly realised :p
IshBestPony: Sparkle sparkle sparkle motherbucker!
otakon: i don't speka any language besides german and english and i can still recognize them
okay, back to ME3, see you there RX-78|FireEmblem
*huggles Ran*
TheRainbowDash: I need more cider!! *hic*

Have fun, otakon.

Dark_Horst: No, they bmade another guy leader
You know what they did to my ancestors? Pretty much the same thing and slavery

But the leader they chose is just a puppet of Aguirre
Do not worry, all. I feel like I had fun with my dad as of today.

Because this is what you want in movies: The legalization of documents!
Ghosties: Uh-oh, the chapters of the movie again? When are you going to publish and release the hard-cover copy of your interpretation of this movie, with 99.9999 chapters?:D

Sumica: I'd have figured Funimation would be all over that
they're kind of cute
pipe*
11,02GET HIM

Kandarihu: you don't say

yay!
yay legend of Korra
Sumica: hell yes

I'll be looking forward to that :D
Cant wait Sumica
oh god
Would I have to have watched all the way through Avatar: The Last Airbender to follow Legend of Korra?
/me yay Sumi
sorta
Is this the movie Val chose?
CCCP: yes
Kinda but not really
they say Troll 2 is so bad:D
oh
Sumica: Funimation ahs eps 3 and 4 on their website.
The question is... how did you not watch Avatar?
lol. outhouse on a raft
inb4 wmc
dat potty
F is for friends who do things together!!
Wait. Accel World is pre-licensed?
Thats where Pollution was invented
No you don't need to watch Avatar
and what i've heard of silence of the lambs does not sound good
There are nice easter eggs if you did, though
Val says he chose it because he hates it and wants us to share his misery, but I love this movie and had already seen it multiple times before last night
Kandarihu: yep. it's on Hulu thanks to Viz
00,10meh
00,10I prefer local copys
but how come it's yours? CUZ I SAID SO, DIE!
it's good, but there are some strange parts
is this a comedy
So what happened in the past 30 minutes? I was washing the dishes.
..... nope its a horror film
Sadly it isn't
00,10besides sage has 720p copys
no its a documentary

Hi Biglaw.
hey Biglaw what you been up to

Midnight_Fyre: proving again that IMDB ratings are horse piss
Titanic 2 makes me laugh

8.1 from what, 19 review?
Titanic 2 needed Sea Ponies
Headshot
so... WHY THEY NO MAKE TITANIC 3
what are we watching? and alexxm it was good
he took an arrow to the head
RAWRity: Film critics often put this among the best films ever made
she ded
TITANIC ANIMATED MOVIE!
Titanic 3: Iceberg's revenge
Titanic 420 bro @_@
lol
Midnight_Fyre: proving that film critics don't know what they're talking about.
Titanic 4: A New Boat
lol
stop the Titanic please
Titanic 2: Return of the Iceberg

Biglaw: too late
There is a reason Val's teacher forced him to watch it in class

CCCP: Oh lawdy XD
:)
HE TALKS WITHOUT A LUNG
what?
LOGIC
His head sounded like a volleyball
Dat ten?
I'm not even a film student, but I can tell that the pacing is awful, the camera work is ridiculous, acting is barely present, and the editing is so haphazard it borders on incomprehensible.
198
Sorry I have the stream paused.
Newsflash: It's a jungle. There are no walls.
So is this the new Avengers movie?
Rawrity: Thats why its in german Derp
nice review
*155 years later* IM FREE
RAWRity: Most critics, and myself, would disagree
And Title Drop.
this guy looks like an ugly edge
Well, I'll go pick it up.
At least "Tree of Life" had the redeeming quality of having good cinematography. This is barely on the level of a student film shot on a camcorder.
Did everypony see my rendation of Bronysith as a pony?
/me yawns
nope
No.
no
http://fav.me/d4xzhg1
Ooo A link!
/me shoves a sock in Espeon's mouth
This movie is meant to draw you in, which is sadly impossible when watching in a chat. It's not meant to be watched this way
This movie is still on? O_o
Not bad
ewwww
So if the movie is supposed to be historically accurate, how come they don't notice someone holding a camera to their face?
Eating algae?
BETTER THAN KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
lol nice Biglaw
Midnight_Fyre: yep
lol
Nice
Watch the rat eat its young

You made me yawn

13inb4 you misread the word "sock"
I'm back did I miss anything?

What's "drawing me out" of the film is the completely aimless direction
DeathStar: you missed some walking and talking
11,02Awesome Biglaw :D
Butterfly?
OMNOMNOM
o.o
Eat eet
What is this place, filled with so many wonders?
LauraP: because back in the day, there were no cameras in anypony's face.

Darkts3: ill tell u when your older
Ah yes. The Rarity-calibur arrows
SuperBrony64|NOMZ I went to East Side Mario's :)
Seriously, am I the only one who likes this movie?
long arrows are fashionable.
twilight_sprinkle: its a joke

11,02MisterBen: Well, if I leave now, I won't be able to swap to the pony episode :P

/me hugs TheRainbowDash
CCCP: okay =D
:)
11,02Biglaw: I don't has nopony to call O.O
You know what? I can never consider this movie to be boring. Surely it's moving at a snail's pace. But these people are on an adventure. Even though it ends in failure, it's better that it has a beginning middle and end.
Darkts3: but that doesn't mean your right
LauraP: cuz it looks cool i guess, lol
LauraP: the ladys love it
SuperBrony64|NOMZ I'd give you mah food if I could :3
swag
lol
Most of these Oscar-bait movies, that are just old people talking to each other, now THOSE movies are boring as heck.
what did you have TheRainbowDash
lol
/me dances
its time to own some noobs
kandarihu: Agreed. The film's pace matches with the general story and message behind it, which is why it works
This is like Minecraft Multiplayer: The Movie
lol
alexxm: Toast as usual, and turkey slices and, yes, some rice!:O
Dat Rice
mmmmmmm rice
rice
wats this rated by the way?
I need my toast, though, vital to my survival, and yes Ninjazz, it is possible that RBD is asain.
Rice is delicious.
TheRainbowDash: :O
Nasi Goreng is delish
Well i gotta go. I might be back if I have time. Later everypony.
he's hallucinating
Actually, may be confirmed...
Somebody ping me when this crap ends

The conquistadors are alone, drifting toward destruction among their own delusions. That is why the tone and pace match it so well
See ya Obsidian!
This dude is tripping

/me PAWNCHES Darkts3 for tricking her
/me dances
TheRainbowDash: You must take care of yourself more, Dashie...
90 minutes of dull, poorly acted pallor, all for a shot of him firing himself out of a cannon. I could dig it.
haha
Oh, if you're on Chapter 100, the movie must be almost over, right?
Ninjazz: I know....I wanted to reattach to my head, but you ate it already...
If only he could start a fire
/me dances with DeathStar
i wouldnt say it was poorly acted
so, question on whether a movie is A or B.
10/10. Love it, but I wish it wasn't so short
WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE
It pretty much is over.
O U Midnight_Fyre
TheRainbowDash: Well, you tasted delicious. :P
Hmm

Now its my turn to be serious
Ninjazz: Umm....thanks?

11,029/10, lost points cause Nicholas Cage wasn't in it
I don't think it was as bad some people made it out to be
SuperBrony64|NOMZ :D
TheRainbowDash: It was the greatest completment I could ever give! :)
Nicholas Cage makes everything better
You're right, dari. It was worse.
also Johnny Depp
yes SB64 LOL
But it's hardly the most riveting film.
Ninjazz: Ok then...:D
It's not bad, it's just kinda poorly done in some places
