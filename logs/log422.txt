That movie was terrible
*trollface*
They could've just talked to her, not bitch-slap her and making her feel awful, you know?
errr,,,
Yes
-.- I hate this episode..
This episode made me hate RD tbh
Didn't Merryweather write Hearths warming eve
tail in a bun
I hated DG and how it promote RarityxSpike
Granny is not amused
Radu: talking isnt as effective.
Radu: She can ALWAYS get a nice ego shaving
bitchslap? RAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
Impression of RD is below 0..
And it really wasnt as bad as I thought it would be
Radu, yes. Even if RD wouldn't have listened, it would have made the characters work
O_o
dat grunting
hey Guys
after the Trixie incident, RD should have learned about boasting ;)
Show of power!
oh brother
dat voice
nomf
Tubs of jelly
dat bite
Dat neck crack
rofl
All of them are being bad. I just highlighted Twilight in that scene
11,01Spike didn't like being babied by Rarity, which was OOC of Spike IMO.
Oh boy, fans of different ponies are fighting.
:O PONIES?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
umm...
Ugh... WHY DO WE WATCH THIS EPISODE WHEN ALL IT CAUSES IS ARGUMENTS?!
Yaaay~

You're *always* amazing.
create a domain
I'm gonna play faceraiders, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Radu: theyre teaching rd a lesson
This episode just makes the entire mane 6 look bad
I've never *created* a domain
LAME
One does not simply mow the lawn.
SHORYUKEN
Radu: rd might jsut ignroe talking
Talking is the key to solving things.

Moar Buffering
While chasing Mare-Do-Well, a lumber yard burned down
Well.. i guess this episode isnt all bad.. she learns humility making her even more awesome than before >.>
That's impossible
I think the buffer improved the scene immensely. xD
A witness, kill her she knows to much
I used magic
O.o
SARREEE
'salright.
Hello everypony
you know, pinkie wasn't around for the entire episode until now
Failed murder attempt
Saarry!!
hmmmm
ti- uh... i mean Kicks McGee
HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?
Rarity was pretty underpowered here...
Because you're a bitch.
Hmm, okay
This episode deserves to be sucked into a void.
Knock that shit off Rainbow dash
Played a bit of this, bit of that

Still episode makes her look like a total bitch =c

11,02Bit of a low score at 5.3/10
I WANTED TO SEE THAT MOVIE BUT FORGOT TO
that one is schlock
05,1525% on Rotten Tomatoes
Inb4 a million luna jokes during that movie
I've heard it got bad review
04*to make
man, pick another!
Budget was only $5m
11,01Apollo 18 was a theater release.
it got 25% and a 5.3 for gods sake!
05,15low budget, low rating
movie reviewers are idiots anyway
ouch
Hm. May be a repick.
2,14 he might have swapped them by accident
hmm
04The fuck is Lunopolis?
netlogon server is stopped

11,01Luna would know =p
6.2 IMDb
11,01It's probably on the moon.
even I have never heard of that one
Fuck if I know
Moon madness there
no idea
spaaaaaaaace
no idea
11,01I was half-right.
low budget, low ratings=not being shown
Or is it the same song?
It's from Civilization III
11,02alright, since it is neither a really good movie nor a high budget one, we'll reroll for another A Movie

Interview Time
and I cried when you turned down zombieland
http://i.imgur.com/vGp2t.jpg
ouuu
05,15FillyFlam check our FAQ
I chose Pirates of the Carribean for the A movie myself
I always thought of it as a cult film
Check rating and budget
1,3imdb > 7.0 or rotten tomatoes > 80%
should I get Graffiti Burger or HoundDogs pizza
I chose Bat 1989man
We get trolled?
If i nominated The
Troll2 was only picked for that stupid fucking like, I know it.
Night Radu
D:
line*
Gnight Radu
13yes
they should just show two movies, instead of 1 A and one B...distinction seems silly to me
13because the matrix is an a movie
pizzaaaaaaa
Knew it! :D
fine The Matrix Revolution it is
Wait, columbus Ohio?
Go for the Hound Dog's
/me dances
great
13which based on budget and return is also A
11,01The Matrix is definite A.
yes RX
it never made sense
hiii
Which is tragic because my old one hasn't been shown yet.
Waterworld had a huge budget. :P
?
13like back to the future, matrix 2 and 3 only work together as one film
13on their own the plot is fractured
hiiii~
Havent gotten around to looking at local meetups yet
05,15A is budget AND ratings
hopefully i get picked sometime in the future :3
I would vote for Braindead, but I don't know where it is
i picked the movie "red"\
13matrix 3 enjoys a 6.5 on IMDB, which is higher than some As we've shown
intermissions over again
YES
I'd vote for "The Moon", but i'm not sure which category it belongs too.
11,02ALright, give us a few min
that feel when my movie renderer has been on 99% for 2½ hours...
Just how long?...
=/
clop clop clop
I'd propose Amadeus
everypony..... run.
0____0
this movie is actually very good
Run from this film.
I hope you all like subtitles
what's the flic?
05,15I really like her.....mane
Next movie is supposedly good...yet shown as B..:/
Is that?...
well not that terrible but entertaining enough to kill time
Is that?...
I remember when someone drew that on stream... I think
90's horror flic about a detective
Hmm. What's the lowest "high" rating for a film on imdb?
05,15pony_4588 it's BORING
laggy
if the movie is any good
MOD LOGIC
(mostly because I want to vote for Twilight but I'm not sure which category to put it in)
You didn't just read that.
Napolean Dynamite has to be an A
2,14 rating isn't everything
well see :)
That's totally not my evil plan.
thats lies
Was playing L4D2, we all ragequit'd
o.o
I really don't get why Aguire was supposed to be a good movie, definitely must've missed something
=/
and now time for Fairly OddParents
sooooo
Caillin u still there
the circle of buffering
Gah ffs I can't find a budget on this movie.
Chapter 1: THE BUFFER CIRCLE!
Now I'm interested.
Oh.
hm... is it playing? i'm buffering round and round
:D
Can't say.
where da stream at?
Ehhh. Harry Potter is too mainstream.
NO ONE CAN HELP ME.
and ill pick the LONGEST one

Oi! Twilight is pony, not an terrible movie.
Twilight is an R movie, as in Rifftrax movie
you might be filling a niche
Yes
this is why some people like college radio
niche formats
wat happenned to the stream?
I didn't know the lottery was this early, because it's around 3:00 am in my place
where did it get its high rating from :T
the problem is going to be getting enough songs for the upcoming weeks
I have enough for next week but that's about all the music I have
05,15We're setting up for the interview mentioned in the newsletter that you should all know about

And then the movie trolls you with organ music :D
Yes.
05,15Ninjazz it's REALLY REALLY BORING

You're right, dari. It was worse.
But it's hardly the most riveting film.
It's not bad, it's just kinda poorly done in some places
