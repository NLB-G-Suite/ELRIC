But then again if they did that we wouldn't have an episode
MA LITTLE PONA
:D
Oh yay, a best pone episode.
1,11Couldn't they just use Twi's magic to float the cake perfectly to the train?
03according to seatguru or whatever that site is, only first-class has the actual power outlets you can charge laptops with
That intro :)
Pinkie can't handle Mac's big load!!
UNTILL YOU ALL SHARED IT MAGIC WITH ME

He's a french chef. He's SUPPOSED to act arrogant. Otherwise he's not doing it right. :P
How long IS the train ride from Ponyville to Canterlot?

05,15Also, I'm not opposed to difficulty. I like "Nintendo Hard" games, but Dark Souls is downright sadistic
dat rarity
11,01*gasp*
DAT RARITY!
=/
lol
Oh Rarity <3.
05,15WHAT IS YOUR SECRET
Man, tabitha st germain is awesome here.

Everybody but Applejack
Rarity, y u false eyelashes
lol
dat voiceacting
dat cake
AND I TOOK A BITE OF THAT CAKE
Oh and i took a bite of the cake.
Rarity
Run around my room in 80 days?
But then again, she IS the Element of Honesty
SUSPENSE D:
Notice how Applejack is the only pony that didn't eat the cake.<3
fluttercry: keep my distance?
Dear Princess Celestia, Today I learned that all of my friends are backstabbing bastards
CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
Celestia Demands BLOOD
fluttercry: i beat demons souls
fluttershy did it?? D:
lady like bite? = CHOMP!
TheForgottenAlex: thats because she can't lie
Dark souls is a lot of trial and error
applejack?
I ate the Moose
Everypony except Twilight and Applejack... actually that's pretty believable.
xD
Applejack is honosty so she wouldn't even think about it...
04I broke the damn
fluttercry: I beat them with the Knight
So either way, she couldnt lie
Spriggals: i noticed
apple jack never does anything wrong.....
XD
04*dam
applejack and twilight didn't get any, neither did pinkie :(
those gargoyles are easy imo
the gargoyles on the church aren't that hard though
HM, now somebody seem to be the odd-pony out, but I can't see to put my hoof on it...
I wouldnt be sorry *shrugs*
^
mostly sorry
Jim: no thats demons souls, dark souls is incredibly unfair
I bet I can do it in 80 seconds
dat aj face
aj didnt do shit
or even less
it was twillight she just framed everyone
Applejack is honest...she would have said it in the first time anyway
just go for the tail
pinkie ate the rest of it
Everlasting_Joy: They are on a completely different mental level. True, the clues are prety obvious, but so were the clues in shows like Blues Clues and they showed that to the audience as they went along. It lets the kids feel clever
Spriggals: makes me wonder why the hell is she there
fluttercry: play demons souls. it is better
"All my friends were there! ...Oh, and Applejack too."
Dark Souls can get very bad
Promotion!
fluttercry: I want to see how you play the game. I cleared the two gargoyles on my first try. Again, you should of summoned Solaire
we need our handy dandy.. notebook
it was applejack she did all of it
that's why AJ is boring
Applejakc is the element of HONESTY. If she had eaten it, she would have just admitted it. :P
Smough and Ornstein especially
dat physics
pinkie has been promoted to leaderhat
Did Applejack even talk in this episode?
its applejack .:U
Shot
05,15Am I seriously the only one that had difficulty with those guys? WHO THE FUCK IS SOLAIRE
/me 11,01finds
Yes.
:O
AJ is a good pony
RivaLz: Have you forgetten about The Last Roundup?
and NOW she can deduce
Midnight_Fyre: But the BC audience and the MLP target audience are different.
Gasp

You can't hide anything from Pinkie. It is hopeless; don't try.
Julia Child...
Side note, AJ and Twilight never got a bite of anything
05,15My only weapons are a halberd and a sword....
Actually no... but it would be boring if she was it Spell-Of-Gaming
i hate the donkeys voice
Also Rainbow Dash again.
ewwww old ladies
I hate her voice
fluttercry: He's an NPC you could summon to help you fight the gargoyles. He's a freakin' tank and can easily distract one. Also, he throws lightning bolts. FREAKIN' LIGHTING BOLTS
i just watched this earlier
They all failed
sure thats eclair in his hair
Midnight_Fyre: It's amazing what given a few years can do to one's mind.
Mullia has a hemroid

Dear Princess Celestia: today I learned that nobody in Ponyville has any impulse control.

My next honor ban will last for 64 hours. I'd like to get through the movie without starting that ban so that I can explain myself and try to make amends.
fluttercry: its not cheating. as long as you dont use cheat codes. and also if you looked up what to do on a agame like PORTAL then it would be cheating

SQUEIIIRIERIERIEREL
fluttercry: ;A; why you make me cry ;A;
you want some cheesy poofs
LOTTERY TIME!
Midnight_Fyre: As much as I'm swinging to "show the clues" piece, part of the problem here is, again, it's too obvious. If they had shown us, it would have taken the hint of mystery out, and would have ruined the episode.
EAT TIME< HOW BOUT ELCAIRE OR DONUTS OR mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
fluttercry: look up the wiki for help
11,02Aww...did I miss the end of Zombieland?

all this talk about dark souls has me wanting to play again
Yeah...
SuperZombie64: yes you did
Are you guys going to keep using that sillhouette from earlier, or is AJ's hat just too big?
:3
YUPIT WAS AMAZING
SuperZombie64: I'm afraid so
Midnight_Fyre: IMO, it was a catch-22 situation, but they took the path they took.
Everlasting_Joy: agreed, still a fun ep
By 22 minutes...
xD
Time to kill some zombies
00,10how cute it linked and quit
So is that lottery tonight?
The end of zombie land in one word:
The intermission music should be by a brony mucision like alllevelsatounce or teithepony...

fluttercry: ...yes, there is. He's where otakon described. Upgrading stuff is really simple and cheep. Also you should at least look up how to get the Drake Sword, it's an extremely overpowered sword you can get earily on
ait
otakon: how is that I only palyed the demo and it seemed kinda meh to me

Dragon's Dogma is reasonable hard, but not bullshiting so, and way too much fun

SuperZombie64: I'll scream.. D:

SuperZombie64: XD do homework
Angel_Cloud: Stop it with the links...
SB.. What?! Sisters can't do that!
Cya SuperZombie64! Nom on some brains for ALL of us!
05dont like l4d2 that much
Everlasting_Joy: I don't think it's a huge issue, I just would have preferred the other way. Were the clues obvious? Yeah, but The goal shouldn't really to make it complicated for the kids but to let them sort of play along and figure it out as it went. It certainly was obvious to Twilight when she saw the clues
I got my cup of yogurt
so much liks today
silly ponies they just dont learn with their video links
So no announcments to +m for this time? But what trilogy are you doing next week?
I go take a pissbreak yeah...oh well i shouldnt have said that anyway xD Oh i need some Orange Juice so brb! :D

...Strange times indeed
DoctorTimeyWimey: good for you... I still don't care
How about you guys?
11,01Oh good, I didn't miss a +m.
08,01XxXSC00t4L00XxX: what is MLG?
11,01Needs more maids.
...what is friendship?
00,03Men Lacking Girls :(
1,11Alright, let me make this perfectly clear.
RX-78-SweetieBot: They aren't that hard to get by if you know how. Just straight up rushing worked for me several times
1,11DON'T POST LINKS TO OUTSIDE VIDEOS DURING THE STREAM!!!
everything in need for the lotery
11,02Let it be known that ponibas doesn't care about ponies apparently.
My way of saying hi: Hey, hey lady, lady, lady, lady.... laaady.... Space
00,03Especially pony videos, those are annoying >_<
1,11That's three kicks and and a ban now because of it.
I am not happy the Max Magic movie could not be found.
1,11It's in the rules. Read them.
Neither am I
It cannot be helped, I guess.
11,01Funny. We usually don't have a problem with people posting video links so much.
Falloutsilverscreen: can i ask a question?
They are realy goddammed annoying still. I ended up using the ring that helps stop enemies from noticing you as easily and then picked them off with a bow
Randomnerd: Mee neither. I was looking forward to it. It sounded on par with Trol 2
I love this song <3
a
well it was durning intermission
1,11Derpy_Hooves: ask away.
Please SuperZombie64 ): I need help.
05dinky: doesnt matter
so that's what +m and -m mean
Falloutsilverscreen: WHAT IS A MAN?!
a stream is still a stream
dat intermission
11,01But PMing the stream for video requests when they aren't being taken...
This is the most quiet after +m ever... O__O
I didn't see anything during the actual movie
A miserable pile of secrets
05Athgaar: during +m only mods and above can speak
Alright...
11,01*streamer

Where was Gondor when short +,ms

Well, +v can talk...
1,11Dinky: Intermission is still the stream.
RX-78-SweetieBot: That's... kinda how the game was meant to be played. One strategy doesn't work? Try another
lol
04Only mods can, Crystalpop
/me is glomped
14I love uppering my glass a very slightly bit, looking at the person and say his/her name as my way of saying hi. But I never do this unless with a certain person because nobody would get the reference b.b
Crystalpop: only mods
Enough talk Have at You!
I'm confused...
Oh

GLOMP PILE ON Wrek

/me is confused
Horray
o3o
04<YorkBrony> Can I talk <-- NO >:I
I know, still annoying.
/me 08,01steals Wrek
Hey do the chat rooms ever fill up when a MLP episode is aired?
04......Yes
1,11Mods have colored text to make them more noticable during the stream.
0,14Very much so
/me eats TheLastTwinkie :3
/me is being glomped all around, but the complers only boucne off.
13I dunno about you but when I greet someone I wave and say hello xD
@TheLastTwinkle: OH NOE

How early do you have to show up?

You have no idea Dinky....

This is a kickin' song.

God damn bloody wollywogs and their damned fat squishing.

XxXSC00t4L00XxX: i know the fail safe for colors
dinky: when a new MLP episode airs, this channel is sealed off and everyone has to go to one of 6 side rooms.
My favorite character is DURRRAGRRRRR
^ at least in IRL
00,03Dragoncon?
Damn, I'm not cool enough

I am cured!!!
Am I only one who got the beep....
I'm not sure what to rate it. Like I said, it tries to do too much and it's all over the place and pushed the limits of taste. But some of the scenes were too good. 7/10? Maybe an 8?

the fart explosion was the only thing that truely made it
SheepCharb: Apparently they're ponies
better than A movie, because it wasnt trying to be an A movie, AND it was creative
Best part was the wedding

FRAAAAAAANCE
I'm wondering if this affects us...I live in Kingston, NY.
04Not what I mean, I'm talking about how in Black Sheep the main character was trying to get over his fears by "being a tree" and the comparison was made to Fluttershy. And the pony episode after the movie? It features the "I'd like to be a tree" bit by Fluttershy. The continuity...it is too rich
Why the hell did Harry Potter + ponies happen.
Harmony, the Goddess of Harmony. NAW

I always thought of Wingboners as a sign of bewilderment instead of sexual excitement. :/
Braeburn is best stallion
what song
The eye close ups are a reference to the Sergio Leone westerns, ex: The good, the bad, and the ugly
SolairePony89: except when it's ponies
drop a rainboom
That really was mean to Pinkie, but she was a Sacrificial La... a worthy expenditure for a well-needed lampshade.
Silverscreen: I've always loved your trivia. I'm sorry to have gotten on your bad side.
I think she made it a lil' worse
otakon, why poor braeburn ? rainbow dash has been shipped even with the kitchen sink

WE MUST STOP SHIPPING RD AND BRAEBURN!
I can't wait until the show starts getting super dark, and there's an episode where a bunch of Apaloosan ponies try to lynch zecora

SuperBrony64: The most definate!
/me hugs Airpuff goodnight.

If i were i pony, i think it would be tought to do everything but run from zombies
Airpuff: NIGHTIS!

/me smacks Reikim
03oh yay, spare battery at 0%
Shamroc: how old are you?
/me dances on SuperBrony64 s head
03good thing I tested it beforehand LOL
:$
Shamroc, GO GET THAT LICENSE.
Hey SuperBrony64, I linked this video to you before, did you ever get a chance to watch it? :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FavUpD_IjVY
17....18 in 6 months
Now if you want something involving sheep that's awesome, watch Sheep in the Big City. Quite possibly THE most underrated cartoon show and some of the funniest television in the early 2000s.
Hmm, If I blind myself and move to Illinois, I could get a seeing-eye pony for a pet.
/me picks up DeathStar and gives her a big hug ^-^
RAWRity: i do NOT enjoy cars...
I use the "Bow of Soul's Twilight" in Skyrim. Soul capture is purple colored magic! :)
how come?
K_A Ranting Swede
Tovler: YES.
This is my Samsung Galaxy Y Pro lock screen. :P https://twitter.com/Spell_of_Gaming/status/213828044249509888/photo/1
Polydunami: That video gave me nightmares...not even I would make something like that.
/me hugs SuperBrony64 back "how are you today silly filly?"
RAWRity: i overthink everything...i feel like it would prevent me from makeing decisions on the road
Very important question here. Is the stream DEAD...or does my connection SUCK? Truly a mystery for the ages, to be pondered by many great sages in the centuries to come.
Shamroc: i know what you mean. I HATE DRIVING
richfiles: Clearly they are bronies. *sagely nod*
11,02DeathStar: Good ^-^
Hey now, it's better than Black Sheep :3
Reikim: The stream's gone.
There is currently NO STREAM
Driving does suck, yeah. Too much to focus on. But once you get over that it's fun.
Reikim: Streamers are sleeping. Post links.
Reikim: the stream is over
SuperBrony64: :3 that's good
Links? Posting? YAY
|Discord|, SPIDER COWS.
Shamroc: I had the same problem. What you need to do is find some place that's closed off from traffic and what not, and get confident behind the wheel.
Polydunami: I WOULD NOT
Reikim: i want a gurren lagann instead
Posting links? icybeauti know the perfect one!
I am the law.

/me takes out RX-78-SweetieBot mechanical heart
Once you've gotten used to driving on your own, you can start going into neighborhoods and the like, and then driving with more traffic, then driving on the highway.
I am so long as it annoys someone in here

Shizuka, you have quantum pockets now. Deal with it.

Shizuka: down side...no airblasts...
Om: I'd ask what you're doing but then you'd take longer.

Don't let the zombies BAAAAHHT

Ooh, NewDCD's here?
Om: Just... hurry the buck up.
Reikim duno, i don't even know why Shamroc says i sometimes play in my unkillable self :p
how about MYPLOTCON
wtf
Shizuka: is Asuka annoying? I heard her english VO played her as such
Lunaughty: no!
Lunaughty: I like that
Shizucon. It sounds nice.
otakon: hoooooboy.
Panda-: wait, he got what?
i want sushi now
Reikim: how about. kaminacon or simoncon?
/me gives TheGreatAndPowerfulT sushi
otakon: Asuka is...a challenging, or challenged character.
RAWRity: um... okay what was that about
otakon, he was trying to get some arcade sticks :)
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: its cause you allways ninja my freaking shots.......and everytime i try and melee you clip outa your hitbox
Asuka is....a complicated character to talk about.
I hereby decree our convention to be named OTAKON.
/me eats sushi
Panda-: ah
otakon: But really, you don't want me to get rolling on analysis of Eva.
How about Shizucon ?
2hi there everyone :3
Merch question! :) When is the last time anypony saw a Fashio Style Applejack new in a store?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: jjust kidding. IT WAS DRUGGED
Polydunami: it's already taken
RAWRity: no I mean was her english VO just annoying sounding?
Oh. Dang
Bronysith even better
03oh hi
RAWRity: not her actual character
hi
GilDash: I am! -___- ugh my brother can do it. Don't be mand!
Alistercon
Bronysith i play medic i'm drugged half of the tiem :p
RAWRity: Another Eva fan! Asuka is indeed complicated. So's everyone in Eva, except maybe Mari, but we don't know much about her.
03http://imgur.com/gallery/GVSTs
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: good point
otakon: Oh yes, her english VA was infuriatingly annoying.
RAWRity: okay just wondering
What are you all talking about ?
crap. I'm missing an anime convo
Still no stream? I took a shower, brushed my teeth, and cleaned my retainers in that time.
Shamroc not my fault :p i just jump around
Alister: we have no idea
Om: I did think it was something important... :S
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: your NOT A SCOOT!
Tovler: i cant wait for dragoncon
otakon: Her english VA nailed the tone of stuck-up bitch, devolved perfectly into psychotic bitch, and later became broken bitch.
Reikim: neat
GilDash: I'm sorry.... Can I make it up to you?
Animu stuff again ?
8,6ok, who wants to play some SC2, US servers?
otakon: Unfortunately, the bitch factor remains constant, so it's not the VA's fault.
Reikim: I wouldn't call myself an Eva fan. I recognise what it was trying to do by adding a darker tone to super robot shows, but I feel that it was ultimately too bloated and up its own ass with philosophy for its own good.
kirzstryfe: already in game waiting lol
I know of Dragoncon
don't own SC2
Reikim: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/992/
kirzstryfe: ME
kirzstryfe: stream it?
Om: Go... to... sleep?
kirzstryfe: Like alwayz
Panda-: he plans on it
Reikim: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/992/
8,6going to try
Well, sense the stream still isn't back up, im going to hit the hey. Bye all.
RAWRity: Point taken. I think it was good at pushing boundaries, personally. And the Rebuild movies are just sex for animation fans.
kirzstryfe: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/992/
La
Bronysith: ...Wat.
Bronysith: I'm so sorry you had to see that Rainbow Dash
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2804/
GilDash: I was thinking something else, but that wruks too!
dumdedum
bye Pyromare take care
Thanks
So the stream's still down. Is it a bad thing that I now have no idea what to do with myself?
Quick: favorite anime
There are literally probably around 100 ponies on my bed right now.
Reikim: i posted u a pick
night night, careful of zombies
RAWRity: Bebop
Reikim: so just go and watch gurren lagann
Likely more! :$
RAWRity: Michiko to Hatchin
Om: Are you actually going to sleep now? :|
Bronysith: Saw it. My response was "Wat".
Reikim: i know

GilDash: I promiste! i;m in bed now T~T
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: thats awesome
PrincessLuna: Holla! :)
Om: I'll wait until you've signed out from chat. :p
RAWRity: Damn, that's a tough question. TTGL's pretty high up there, but I'm starting to pick up some new ones. Madoka, Rah Xephon...and then there's FLCL, which I could never forget...oh, and Gunbuster...and can't forget classics like Cowboy Bebop...DAMMIT I CAN'T CHOOSE
Oh BronySith... Just what I always wanted! :$
8,6ok, if you want to play SC2, either get in game if I have you on my list, or get in game and pm me your nick and friend code
GilDash: You don't trust me :$

Oh hay! :) Red Green is on! :$
owlicious: I can assure you, Oniichan no Koto is worse.
That one Manyuu was pretty bad.
Om: What the fuck is he even doing? :D
Polydunami: watch gurren lagann
Queen's Blade is pretty boring too
kirzstryfe: id play, but im on EU servers :(
GilDash: GHHWA don't stay up on account of meee!
RAWRity: was that the one with the obsessive sister and the stalker girl?
08,01i'll need to find a part-time job as well as doing a full-time masters degree, then i'll be living for 4 years on a pitiful PhD stipend...

FlareChaser: NOPE
..... TheGreatAndPowerfulT im hosting it
/me *medaka
|Discord|: what? :P
Like, I need to impress upon you guys how much I hate Oniichan no Koto. It's the worst thing I've ever seen, and I've seen: Eiken, Master of Martial Hearts, Ikki Tousen, Witchblade, and even fucking Garzey's Wing.
and Oniichan no Koto was worse than ALL OF THOSE COMBINED
Reikim: Get on Steam
Can it be Changeling rush tiem naow??? :$
Shamroc very well then
Madoka Box
Om: It has to be. I write databases all day. :S
/me is lurking about for Pegasisters.
RAWRity: it's worse than Eiken? HWO IS THAT POSSIBLE!?
Pills here!
Never.
FlareChaser: stop that it's creepy
Serious question: Do you really thing pegasisters should be a term? Since the general non-brony consensus is that MLP is for girls?
Right, the stream seems to break every ten or twenty seconds for me. Just saying :$
:S
GilDash: ... Yes, I suppose it does. I don't suppose there is any chance of me winning an argument then
....
otakon: you need a comma man.
Eiken Club is awesome. I wish they'd translate the manga
Octavia: Hey ;)
Om: No. So hurry the F up. :D
lol
FlareChaser: :( you no love me anymore...
Big_Macintosh_1992: yes, as adult women are still out of the demographic.
Octavia: I do! silly! :D
Big_Macintosh_1992: I'm indifferent. If they want to use that term, more power to them.
Tovler: ...YOU GET THE FUCK OUT RIGHT NOW.
im on the skype call ftw
RAWRity: WHOA MAN
RAWRity: ok. was just wondering.
FlareChaser: no I don't, STOP CREEPING
GilDash: Do I get goonight kees? o3o
otakon: k.
Tovler: YOU GO AWAY AND FUCKING DIE IN A DUMPSTER
Om: Are you actually going to bed?
RAWRity: WHOA MAN WHOA!
It's been years since I've looked at Eiken Club so my opinions might have changed.
GilDash: Pinkie Primise,
Tovler: I WILL STRING YOU UP BY YOUR SCROTUM AND PISS IN YOUR EYES.
