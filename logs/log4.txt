<HML> drf.lugia.us lol?
I... see
<HML> Which made ocean screwy >.>
And is now slowly commiting suicide.

<HML> And due to the scripting, my speach won't go through

<HML> YEah
<HML> Like badlyt
<HML> *Badly
<HML> Died every few mins a hour ago
Why
...
Because Nest is gone
<HML> Been safe for over >30mins
<HML> Not exactly
<HML> But the host for the server was acting up
its been working fine since nest was disconnected
<HML> No resolvves for the IP
<%Skylands> 10none
Damn
XD
...
<HML> Yeah, nest wasn't the issue per se
<HML> But the lack of it made this worse
<HML> Since there is only one server to have over 25people'
Well, that's something people have to deal with, I agree with arti for taking it down

6please don't tell me that's a script
<Quanyails> 7And there we go again. o.o
6that's going to go off everytime you join
6.....
6wth?
03Aurora
03that script shows the activitiy on the other server
03because ocean has been having massive issues
03so if people can't connect here they can connect there
03and since it's not actually linked here yet that script shows what's going on on each
6the timing of ocean's problems is weird
03I know right
6plus, I haven't seen it go down once
03well my server is up and running but it's not linked here
03it's gone down like 10 times today
Preordered xD
6BW
03that totally gave it away >_>
03yeah
03both games
6not surprised
6cuz you already told us
03I said I might
03XD
6you intended to
6ah
6well
6anyways

7Oh, yeah--remember, Celebi event comin' up.
6*having
03yeah, I was too, I decided to just buy the stupid thing
6I know
03I got both because I collect the games
6I'll handle it once again
I don't collect them
03until I can get real ones
6because haii has already caused problems on the gallery
03well I have every GBA/DS Pokémon title to date
03well
you still have some work to do
*GBA
6was actually fun
6for a while
6but still
you can pick up the older ones at thrift stores
Yeah
for R/B/Y its a CR1616 which can be replaced with a CR2025 and for G/S/C its a CR2025 which can be replaced with a CR2032
6sigh
6and here's where the freaking galleries fail
6there's no message system
o.o
6so i can't alert her
Oh
6unless I make a random post on something
Don't you have her email?
Well, if she even has it
6yeah but I don't think I ever got an lugia.us email
6I am NOT sending from my normal email
6last thing I need is her having it
LOL I know XD
you need as I said a CR2025 or a CR2032
Really?
6a lot of people have tried it and either it's a huge coincidence
6probably the most frustrating one at that
LOL
6before you get pokeballs
6apparently lasts longer
Yeah XD
Silly button cells, brought 4 for my SNES carts
6but yeah, successfully replaced mine
its an exact replacement

while me doing a kingdom hearts fanfic
tower lighting is required by both the FCC and the FAA for towers that tall
and in other times of poor visability

Can't they use like, hot air balloons or something?

brb again...
/me randomly LOL's at a pea
o_O
03http://www.lugia.us/Peas/?643
XD
I'll check the operblocks, but if there are any cleartext passwords in them, I can't include those blocks until /mkpassword <type> <text> has been done, and the type/hash is provided to me
either that I'll go hash them myself and replace the passwords
03uh'
03Ascendant a little help here? LOL
03I think Arti was fine with you just giving me ssh access though, which might be easier
03unless
03you want access to mine?
yeah
uh hang on drf
03k
Draelen yeah
just /mkpasswd md5 them
unless you use sha1 or something
I'll need explicit confirmation before I can do that ;p
@ ssh
03go email her or something LOL
http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6722.msg256650#new
it's not me that wants ssh access ;p
XD
03but I duno
03*dunno
tst.lugia.us
03also Draelen
but uh, I need to restart it to change the servername
03-
03-
03-
03-ocean.lugia.us- *** LocOps -- Server nest.lugia.us closed the connection
03-
03why do I keep getting that
oh yeah
03Arti said it's nothing on her end o.o
unset autoconnect in nest's link block @ Draelen xD
oh wait
03OK
yeah
cloak-keys
03I have them
03he PM'ed them to me
mibbit info
03and the webirc thing
yeah
I think that's all really
03yeah I got it
oh
modules
03she's just helping me is all
sanitizing the oper blocks now
03hey Draelen while you're at it
'sanitizing'
03can you give all the ircops op-override?
03because when services go down that's kinda needed
to*
or maybe give drf services root
and yeah, mabye something a little more creative than tst.lugia.us ;p
03can't that be changed later?
it can, but it means having to go change linkblocks again
back...
03hm
03you know
03can we just call it island.lugia.us?
03That one's really grown on me
sure
fits in with ocean, I'd say ;p
03yeah
get Arti to add the DNS
03let's do that
03I'll reply on the forum thread
you guys figure out the link block passwords
is the IP static?
03yes it is
64.32.1.34
0364.32.1.34
03yeah
lmfao
generating linkblock now
alright
Liiiiiiiiiink...
made me lol
Are the servers going to be linked with SSL? And which port is going to be used for the server links?
03LOL
sure
03SSL yes, 6697
well
we'll make it +7000
03same ports as yours basically
for serversonly
if that's okay with drf
yeah
6697 is client only
03OK
03yeah I don't care
03whatever works LOL
k well then
let me fix everything up
do you want me to set autoconnect?
checking to be sure ocean accepts serveronly 7000 too
03yeah @ autoconnect
Current ports ocean accepts, FYI:
:10:59:45: -ocean.lugia.us- *** Listener on 72.20.16.202:8080, clients 1. is PERM
:10:59:45: -ocean.lugia.us- *** Listener on 72.20.16.202:6667, clients 19. is PERM

:10:59:45: -ocean.lugia.us- *** Listener on 72.20.16.202:6001, clients 1. is PERM serversonly
services are connecting through 66012
6601*
o_O
I have 6001 open on here
and lol stats P
[22:01:19] -drf.lugia.us- *** Listener on 64.32.1.34:9001, clients 1. is PERM clientsonly
[22:01:19] -drf.lugia.us- *** Listener on 64.32.1.34:6001, clients 0. is PERM serversonly

ignore the server name
We're not allowed to open port 8080 on this thing or it'll get killed >>
160sec user ping freq
oh
but hang on
it's a little more forgiving of timeouts and user disconnections
at the expense of longer time to pingout
and reduces netsplits a little

03<JennAway> that's sad
03<Bubbaprog> i guess there is a mountain high enough
for you at least, need to know which other active opers require it
03the others dunno
hm
add those manually in the link I provided then
hang on
03LOL Arti doesn't have override ability?
03her loss :P
she uses /samode
it's not been required before ;p
requested*
rather
x.x
yeah
maybe drf as services root, up to you though
03just add everyone, I mean, we're ircops for a reason
lmfao
03I mea
well stupid SSH is lagging
03*mean
03everyone that's on the list already :P
/me prefers an explicit list rather than a vauge "everyone" ;p
03well then
I assume ones like TimeShift and etc should not be on there, etc
and TimeShift...left
03yeah
03but I won't ask
He wasn't on when the oper blocks were made
03<EddieGordo> stick them on gnutella
03<EddieGordo> they already have a good collection going
k thanks Draelen

Deploying linkblock for island.lugia.us, you'll only be able to /connect to ocean from islands side, until the DNS entry is fixed
03OK
okay
03right well it's 6:30am here
03just waiting until everything's taken care of
should be just about done
linkblock for island active, it should be able to connect now
alright, I'll just rehash and set autoconnect
yeah I do
I remember when I once didn't do that
x.x

03sigh
03well
Alright, seeya drf
it was the password
well, thats just silly
wtf
I don't get it
it was identical on both sides
yeah o___o
we arent keeping it as 'password' however ;p
yeah
I was going to say that
hm
I have no idea why that wasn't working
oh f
That password thing is still irking me

NS is NightShadow, right?

just make sure that vid works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBi7zwjp20E
and something's bork
oh yes
I disabled it for SW, lol
hmm
6I'm sure if you shmush an orchestra's worth of instrumental notes on one line, it'd sound and look similarly.
03also

elitter is going to lose customers this way
6Ooh, spammy part at end.
good thing about mIRC bots, there's always just using it regularly
03XD
you gotta concider that its a free service too, right
yeah still

6And the tracks are smushed on one line. :P
03well

jasperbot is my best friend, right?
tuesday
03but LOL
03notice how around 2:11 it starts lagging
do you have any friends with one? <<< no
huh
would you have any uses for a server?
other than this, because you can definitely just buy one
if not, just rent one
/me np: Shauna McCoy - He Drives Me Crazy [03:30m/192kbps/44kHz]
whoa Iskierka's right on the money
look
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kffacxfA7G4

yeah LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS
6o.o
i don't have the money for a server
03LOL win
$13/mo?
Epic bieber fail
no
i would give you mine, but its full D:
6Please get off of me, cat, I'd like to get to my binder. ovo
LOL :o
03shoot it out of a cannon.
Yes!
03well
03the other thing we're trying to do
:D
hey
a desktop
with like, nothing installed
just the comp, and whats needed
lol
and a 10 GB HDD
can you even get 10GB anymore?
doesn't look to
o.O
if you're renting a server, it's probably actually a portion of a machine that serves lots of people
which is why it's much cheaper
/me waves
it's a tiny portion of the whole price
Hi Kitten :o
hey

it's generally either intel or amd
o_O
its intel
o.O
i meant comp
right
/me goes to the corner to cry
but i need a whole comp for like less than $100
when I say cpu, I mean the processor
oh

03I misread that as get a room
Extract the .SDAT
...I'm already on a RO... oh.
:)
then go to a .SSEQ file in the .SDAT and replace everything but the header data with 00
Best to use VGMTrans with that actually
Open the .NDS ROM into VGMTrans (click n' drag works, and only that).
Look at its data
LOL
Replace all the track info with 00

03wait
03now it's working
wot
@_@
03hm.
03Music MasterWorks fails too
03I think both of those, as well as Syntehsia or w/e it is, use the DirectShow MIDI parser
03and that's what's screwing up
at script at any language
and its always my bad luck
something doesnt work
or goes wrong
=.=
04back
o_O
it's simpler than you think it is
04ty
learn the basic syntax
then use logic to make scripts out of it
/me hugs back
~(Armageddon) and that if you drop one thing and give up all the time ou're a shithead<- I drop everything and give up most things, and i'm WOOOONDERFULLLL
/me continues idling.
hmmm
perl was desent
decent
as in running
Most of mine are
do you know why i gave up
larning perl
is it because of me
learning*
03...LOL
perl lmfao
python > perl
perl is simple shit
03there's seriously like at least 25 piano notes at once
that's how much I dislike perl :{D
03I need to find a MIDI engine that doesn't screw up like that
and I hate C++
xD
Python ftw
See, I knew it
i though i was a sore loser
but i see that at the time
you sunk even low to like of no ones sunk before
do you have sibelius?
03no
03-j
._.
learn PHP
if you were to lighten up a ton then just maybe people like me wont get pirckish at you
no
you know
well why open a help chan for perl
?
I didn't.
if you dont like help
Other people did and asked me to help
well you let it evolve into one
find yourself a language you'll like
There's english
03...LOL Roni Music
03I see why you like it
the fact is ManiZach whom i trust the most he said
it has lots of knobs :>
03LOL
03can you just tell it to play the thing and not touch it?
meh.
03Ultimately I want to make a WAV of it
audacity
afk now
03u
03*uh
>: sometimes is has its disavantages as i lose self esteem q.q
03Audacity doesn't do midi
03wait
03it does
03but wtf
it took me a month to learn hTML properly
even now I'm not that good at it
03uh
you need patience
03it won't play it
`ew
websites i suck at those
xD
programming languages take several months to properly learn
and don't give up on it
and you'll succeed
anyway afk
I would say the best MIDI synthesizer for windoze is sibelius. it can render offline, and it has realistiche instruments if you install kontakt.
XD
04?
see if thats desently easy
03Finale is awesome
but it still sucks
03but I think that justs uses the DirectShow
xD
anyway afk
03and I've already found out that does't work for this
lol Roby
not the best language
Here, look at this, I came across these forums while googling myself.
seriously, it's a useful language
Remember none of it, but if I can learn it at 10 i figure it's simple
Oh yes and link that I forgot to pasta http://www.supportforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=18
but when i look at it
make me wanna give up
03ew
03Sweet MIDI Player lags just as much as winamp
03I want to say that uses directshow
Take the head on approach with everything
Copypasta enough and call it yours.

03the UN Owen song
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx02KOGhjes

well all of this is bacause at the start
you just want me to render it, right?
03yeah
03as a wav
of my exploring of scripts
03as for the file
and computer languages
wher r midi.

Jibberishness and all.

i just hate clients

why can clients point out
OW look
replace this with thie
this*
If you want to take a whack at perl again, I can devote the rest of my night to helping you, due to the fact I AM PROCRASTINATING EVERYTHING I NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW.
but no
err
ill try giving myself a rest from
i might try perl
i do know perl desently well
=.=
Lol
and the client
03what, the Touhou song? XD
doesnt need
YES
03it's a fricking awesome song
extra "modules
etcs
03wtf is wrong with Audacity
@_@ that does my nutt in
03it's randomly playing tracks at like 1000% volume and hurting my ears
Technically it is using extra modules, you just don't see them.
audacity has no midi support
DUN DUN DUUUN
o.O
ow
03yeah I have NO IDEA
but its like installed in the
they finally add it in?

Yeah yeah.
03I'm multitasking
right
03this is a multitrack audio of a Bon Jovi song
03I'm saving it as ogg
i found my old
03but I'm playing it just to listen to
Pastebin
also, it sems to be playing fine for me
I press apple-J in garageband and reduced the tracks to 1 from 16.
xD
03reduced?
then it only uses 20% cpu.
Neat
03you mean increased? o.o;
thats scary
03I know right
at 5min
no, i am using software that i use to practice music
when i had a keyboard long ago
03dunno
03what program are you using n2
midillustrator
03hm
03and it doesn't use directshow? o.o
must be the size of like
a damn bible
@_@
Lol
no, it's its own thing as far as i can tell
It's past 1000 lines already.
well ya see its well on its way
wait...that does not make sense
chan protection|blacklist|tourney|
sorta thing
03...
03wtf is wrong with this multitrack of Runaway
03it's not Audacity's fault, it's the tracks
i cant tell is microsoft's built in synth counts as midi for you
because i have no clue as to midi
hmm
:/
because right now its 4:30 and i am counting dshot as the set of codecs everyone has but everyone hates
http://i55.tinypic.com/2611z0p.jpg
plays fine for me
even that scary part
xD
03hm
midillustrator
03OK I'll check it out
03which one, Maestro?
yeah
the player wont play mid files
03I don't have problems iwth directshow
03it just doesn't like this midi
yeah but if you are having problems with directshow, this wont help much

Yep, uploader is now on the line AFTER the tag that marks it as the name

03XD
03see I saw fronteirnet and was like, that's Australia?
03LOL, more BNCs?
just on a friend's connection
03uh
03what
03oh

and Iskierka
03LOLwut
you f'd up a } somewhere
wtf is it doing
dunno
in the status window

hm
idk
hang on
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b14kz7Qa62E
oh
now it works
wait that's the old script
.-.
derp
even if I redownload the version I uploaded it looks fine ...
download the newest (same link) and try it?
yeah
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b14kz7Qa62E
x.x
oh
wow it works
and is it loading over the previous or are there- there we go.
guess something screwed up before
Thanks
www.youtube.com/watch?v=b14kz7Qa62E
iiit's a little slow.
yeah it is
but I think most lines have HTML
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b14kz7Qa62E
commenting out "elseif ($regex(%x,<a id="watch-username" class="inline-block" href="/user/(.+)">)) set %ytuser $regml(1)" might increase speed a bit
that's the old uploader-detection which I left in case some videos still use that
o_O
hang on
wat
o_O
that was random
wtf
note that that's the one from ages ago, as evidenced by the fact the uploader is missing
it's the one that didn't come through

That should be about 2013?

4TB SSD hard drive

Over $9000 today, affordable in 2013 or 2014

I don't
to anything other than dedicated server hardware which is already faster
Hmmm.
I'll keep my i7-860, 4GB of DDR3 ram, 32bit OS and a HD4350 until I need to upgradre

Hi Andres!

Hi, Catwat.
AAC is not crap
its a more modern and efficient codec than mp3
03I never said AAC was
heya Luna
03that being said I still prefer MP3 over AAC because the tags actually work in Winamp
the AAC tags work in Winamp too
FLAC tags don't work, either
03gtsdll doesn't like them
FLAC tags work in Winamp too
(we're talking about UTF8 tags with GTSDLL)
utf8 <3
then don't use GTSDLL
its depreciated anyway
03eh
AMIP won't work with FLAC UTF8 on my one
03I prefer gtsdll
sad times :(
I was never able to get it to work
plus AMIP supports more format tags
bbl
AAC, FLAC, mp3, and others
جوجل ترجمة
03ft
basically anything Winamp can play even if its only through plugins
/me hidz
6omg LOL
AMIP does do flac, but
03hm?

someone from my school died a day or two ago D:
6people made ome insaaaaaane arranges of sakuya's theme

I don't use UTF-8 tags

^this song has japanes tags. it breaks
6I'm trying
03Sibelius can change its rendering?
03the default one, well
03it didn't break as badly as DShow but it still broke
D:
did you install kontakt?
03no
I act all wrong.

6ok
6now I give up
03I still need Sibelius?

Welcome back
03ah hm
03but the tempo is off
03I'm trying to find a program that can change that
:O
no
Explain why you did not want spam there then? :o
he was on my shell
well, our shell
10hi
whats up
I was just thinking about RocketGang and looking at the forums
x.x
I am starting to have doubts about that group's survival
03:<
I'm gasping for breath
/me hugs people randomly
hi ariste
/me hugs back :3
xD
not providing anything unique
set 224 bpm.
03wtf though
03in this .mus, it changes temps all over the place
hi aristeoooooo!
03It should be 224 all the way through, yes?
garageband 3 supports fixed tempo.
which I'm guessing entirely
03so does anything else
xD
03but the song itself changes them
fun
G4 supports variable tempo but you need to set it yourself
try without stopping
and constantly panting
sibelius supports variable
then running at the end
/me sits on aristeo's lap
xD
/me takes a step back
03hm there we go
03Music MasterWorks let me just go and delete all the other temps
03*tempos
03let's see how this handles now
lol
this is kinda ez
03you have any use for a .mus file though?
no.
the finale UI is too flashy on a mac.
03LOL
03but I'm used to 2003a, back when it was legitly free
03darn.
03it still fails
03whether it's 1 track or 16 or whatever
try http://www.mediafire.com/?l6b3kd8whfm91 owen16. i fixed the 1:59 problem, i think.
03same problem
03it's the sound buffer prolly
03LOL stupid Macs
humm
03"Jun Hong's Album"

03it's one of those things
03that if they stopped calling themself that
03people would stop
well people can learn to ignore that crap
except they don't
03but they're all "Yo yo my n****" and whatnot
yeah

03well
well you don't use it in arguments
02FFF
03that's why you need a script

03I have over 9000 tests this week
03or something
03then sure go for it
but if used like zomg every damn line
then no, it's not
instead of saying like "gazillion" or "umpteen" or something
if something i HUGE
03yeah
then it's over 9000

oh hey n2, do you have a mIRC mailing script? lol
like, send mail from mIRC x.x
no
i cant imagine it would be that hard to make though
rofl Majin
hmm...unless you use gmail or something
ALL serebii ops are idiots
Tomorrow I'll change my WB message
yeah, sending mail seems really easy
again, if you dont use a service like gmail where SMTP is required to go over SSL
Serebii and intelligence can't co-exist.
Ever.
[09:57] <Espeon> Serebii and intelligence can't co-exist.
[09:57] <Espeon> Ever.

when you take him out of his element
er...take him out of his channel
XD
i think i blew up everyone's heads
xD
Well, touhou music blew up my laptop's music playbac
icba to fix that
well n2
I can use Horde/SquirrelMail
dunno
/me appears.
xD
the key is to use a service that allows you to use an external mail client
if they say it can connect with outlook or thunderbird, you are probabally fine
too easy to break shi..stuff
4chan is too lol
Derp
/me is dissapoint
find a service that allows POP3/SMTP
Oh no!
send the mail via SMTP
and call it a day
:<
knowing how spammers ruined mail though, it probabally wont be easy
xD
well as long as it's not sendmail
initial findings say it should be easy
connect using SMTP and send the correct commands
is it possible to send via cmd?
or well
define cmd
I could use PHP's mail function
get mIRC to message the CLI interface
wtf
-interface
are you using mIRC or PHP
Bah
mIRC
*mIRCscript
yeah
where did php come from?
well, php has a mail() function or something
yeah, but i mean how did php come into the picture here
couldn't you create a page and then have mIRC do some socket crap and do stuf f on the page?
idk
that seems like uncessary overhead?
*unnecessary
idk
you are using sockets to connect to an smtp server?
I don't know much about mail
least of all smtp
fffffffffffffffffff guys
great
but I don't know how they work
xD
hm
and the glorious RFC documents
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0821.txt
would you look at that
xD
a document explaining everything you need to know about SMTP
/me np: Mayumi Iizuka - Rapurasu Ni Notte (TV Anime [Poketto Monsutaa] Endingu Teema Songu) [03:50m/320kbps/44kHz]

take a note from mail clients
*outlook
thats the point of pop3
<MajinMew> http://www.serebiiforums.com/showpost.php?p=12009088&postcount=568

well this only needs sending
not receiving
the simpliest thing in the world
/me pounces her Stitch
it makes sense to me
*the simpliest mail client in the world
Ellie is fail, she needs a gline
:>
most of these protocols are really easy to read
and work with
/me back

ort errors. If accepted,
the receiver-SMTP returns a 250 OK reply.
Also I've made a few posts to the forums
:D
you are even familliar with the style from working with sockets and the http protocol
/me hugs Nekola.
sockets aren't my thing
nice :3
sockets are annoying
but when you need to use them, use them well
/me hugs
yeah
/me hugs the skies.
I don't see why people bother with sites that's not worth bothering with.
XD
xD
also Xeli
just posted TCTL chapter 5
that was my first and last script using sockets
TCTL? o:

16 mins?
how do you figure that?
whois
I have a +E module installed that is for normal users and serves the same purpose as +W
I have it set on myself
I'll see tomorrow.
I'm just wondering where 16 comes from ...
since I'd spoken more recently than that on other channels but far longer here
/umode2 +E
okay XD
03were there any other ones that you made for Cone?
I read it
were things like !define on cone? I could have a go at writing those
xD
03no
You should read Reminiscence
I need to rewrite it though
lol
I have +E on :D
minus the scripts I don't have and !chatstats
I'll set that up one day in the future

how would such work?
B/W are being released soon, right?
As in March
idk
I'm waiting for Yugioh 2011

n2 explained about smtp and everything
and mail protocols
And I'm supposed to magically know the access defaults were changed?
I chose to accuse Ellie because: One, she does have enough access to add and view akicks if the defaults are there, and I doubt they're not. Two, another user mentioned Ellie takes care of the akicks now, in fact quite a few have. Three, I've seen her abuse before myself. I'm not going to dig up logs, do that yourself if you don't believe me.

Yes

I think I said it yesterday

Yeah
I seriously hate my computer
infact
It's completely destroyed my entire connection to the regular serive
*server
with my backround stating it has an infection
hey Griggs
hi
that changes you're backround into 'YOU HAVE A VIRUS'
and basically maleware can't do shit
and since I'm on safety network
oh
uh
boot in safe mode with networking
then go to norton
I am in safemode
Norton?
norton is..what?
anti-virus
you've never heard of norton?
^
No
tell me how to get to norton
or if its downloadable
You get it free with comcast :p
/me yawns
/me goes to sleep on eXAKR's head
norton.com
and it'll install in safe mode?
seriously i can't believe you've never heard of it
it won't install
it'll do a scan

this?
yeah
except
there'
malware-bytes might be for trojans rather than viruses
i don't know
:O
/me eats
hey
do you know anything about that?
There's too many viruses and trojans for me to know any paticular one
unless it was famous
though c:\Ginger doesn't sound like something a malware would hide in
it usually hides itself
well I've tried Malware twice in safe mode
hey!
thats where they'd usually be
whats up?
Griggs; it doesn't work
in safe mode
it wants me to do it in regular mode

come to think of it
in safe mode it's all 2000 theme isn't it

it's under system or something

12no you have no idea how loopy she has gone
12and she is threatening my father behind his back
is she getting help?
12no
Why?
12we called the police to discuss her behavior and they can't do anything
sorry could not resist
12what i think she needs is to stop abusing drugs
And that
People do despirate things in emotional times
Not at the moment :/
hmmmm....
12we pretty much pulled the entire family together
Actually, I might!
Get teamviewer

Well try
yep
12heh
12how goes Quilava
I can't say I understand because I've never had something this tragic happen to me, but the best I can do is offer some assistance
ÒK Installing
I'm here for ya
Done
12thx..
12but don't feel obligated
12i kind of lost a friend over this already
12he thought i was only going to him for comfort and nothing else, then got ticked off and cut contact with me
12:/
and I'm ok
Get an account?
Clearly
12good to hear Quilava
do you want to get off this topic?
12yes a little
Okay then
12thx
12pokemon is also going dumb for me
12this set pretty much changes nothing for the metagame
Legends?
12lost world decks are crap
12yes
hi
sorry
Gengar is the only thing that works
Open up TeamViewer
12not really
Opened
Otherwise, lost world IS crap
Got an account in the meantime
k
PM me
12my friend made an absol/chatot/mime jr. deck that is effective
I can't see it any more effective than gengar
12not as effective as gengar but still decent
Yea
12thing is though that gengar loses to SP horribly
03Weavile :3
/me hides
I'm thinking about making a 3rd deck
out of random
12which still remains my favorite deck
I already have 1/2 the components
/me dozes off
Maybe
Nighttimes~
12unown isn't a deck that is designed to win
It's designed for annoyance
yep
124 Unown ?
124 Unown F (fake pokepower)
124 blaine's quiz 1, 4 blaine's quiz 2, 4 blaine's quiz 3
lol
124 misty's duel, 4 team galactic's wager
XD
12this is my favorite part
Thats an awesome concept for a joke deck
12are you familiar with unown Q's power?
free retreat
yea
12i mean ?
Yes, I used ? 2 years ago
12ahh
12without their basic form
Evil
12and blaine's quiz 3
Not that one
No
12if they get it wrong you draw 3 cards, if they get it right they draw 3 cards
12XDD
hidden power :p
12no
Ooooooh
12and the base set wigglytuff
1 thing though
Aerodactyl fossil set
no evolving
EVER
12already have an unlimited deck with that
12i play it with the unseen forces ursaring
Same difference
12the way it works
12is before DP
12if a card says "trainers" it means supporters, stadiums and trainers
12after DP if it says "trainers" it only effects trainers
ok
This is why sets dont mix
12because before DP supporters were a type of trainer
12what
hah
03lol Nugget Bridge
In BW?
03wut
03It's in Kanto
Bah, whatever

12so boring that i got an exercising machine thing lawl
:/
/me pets Garochi the chimecho :3
12purr
:3
/me hides
and lol I thought 1920x1080 is the standard pretty much nowadays.
orly
/me is a kitty
its not
I'm too lazy to do that even
hmmm
on the smaller ones it makes text difficult or even impossible to read usually
12D:
with the exception of displays such as Apple's Retina
12you can draw
I do some photography work sometimes
And no I don't find text impossible to read here
its because yours was designed for 1920x1080
Hmmm?
Oh native resolutions
right
That's a whole different league
native resolutions determine the "standard"
Well, most monitors should be either 1920x1080 or 1680x1050 nowadays
well no
Except for notebooks, where it's smaller
you are acting like 100% of computer users need 1920x1080
like I said... I could be doing something productive
Hmmm
but likely not going to :/
I thought it was pretty much standard already
/me pets bree
:2
:3
it is not standard
/me rolls
1280x800 usually for laptops

in my search for the last 12 Master Quest episodes I have to deal with
!ew scalpers
10EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SCALPERS
also because I want legally pressed ones because those tend to last
the average lifespan of a DVD+R is calculated to be about 20 to 30 years and then they oxidize and cannot be read anymore
the legally pressed metalic DVDs can last 100 years or more

again
the kill script for cursing
+G is set
People don't seem to understand something
This site had always had a strict no swearing policy
dis place is mean to be :kid friendly:
Nice image :P
I apparently am the only person trying to keep this chau
(out
At tst
sort of an FYI
its stupid
and un-necessary
Then leave
It remains
+G removes any word matching its dictionary for cursing
it prevents anyone from seeing the expletive
Those words, however, aren't used for more than swearing anyway
If you have the need to swear
Leave
The kill remains
I mean
typoes happen
and I is next to O...
Kill remains
End of story
its too extreme
Its not hard
You just told me >>
no it's not hard
you don't seem to understand its function
it's just a little annoying |3
let me get on my computer
because of unstable computers/dns pool/etc
You two are ticking me off
o.o;
/me wants to confess something as part of his babyfur self >.>
I'm not saying "remove the kill," I'm just saying a kill seems a little bit harsh. A kick doesn't o.o;
but first people should get along in here ._.
it is a bit too harsh
03*WB02(Aurora02)03WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
now that you've successfully dragged me on here
6the kill script remains

6it is harsh yes, but this site has remained with that kill ever since before I joined
the network has been highly unstable recently and its difficult or impossible to connect after a kill
6articuno specifically told me yesterday when I emailed her
because of DNS and routing issues
havent been on here much to see you in a while :3
its not a good idea given the network instability
6until then, she wants the kill script kept in place
6as of now, granted I probably missed it
6I haven't seen ocean go down once
6and am i correct in saying we now have the second server?
I have seen Ocean go down on a regular basis
unable to connect
6>.>
64.32.1.34 ..?
/me checks his laptop
and it takes up to a few hours to reconnect after a kill?
6are you really going to die not being online for that time?
summoned Suijin
its more like, 30mins or sth
two to go :3
for the kill to be acceptable
lol
yeah we have 2 servers for the silverings IRC right?
6this rule has ALWAYS been here lol
+G is enforcement enough for this
it prevents the offending text from being seen
<Aurora> are you really going to die not being online for that time? <-- Don't make fun of my addiction ;~;
/me flees
6IT SHOULD NOT BE SAID IN THE FIRST PLACE
i know it has always been there, but because of recent events, this issue has been highlighted.
6I JUST EXPLAINED THAT
6ffs
6if it's a typo, then I'm sorry
The solutions is simple
6but still
<nickstr> it prevents the offending text from being seen <-- that's the POINT
don't swear
:D
6the kill is here
6what espeon said lol
Thank you Espy
:3
this is not the only time that an old & previously accepted rule has been brought to attention because of a change of opinion. i have seen it happen elsewhere, too.
6ok well
6I'm sorry
6but until Arti declares otherwise
I mean, sure it's annoying to be killed and not being able to rejoin
but it's like swearing is something common. besides typos I have typed <censored > on purpose more than I've sweared lol
plus people are going to come up with workarounds for the kill script
6>.>
13HAWKIE!
07Hey.
6but whatever
but
6I've already stated things
how about we ignore this
07Hm
6and yeah
I mean, myself I'm against censorship.
because this debate is retarded.
But if it's a rule
then it's a rule
10lolol #SW
Lololmorefail XD
I would be ok with this if the consequences did not result in a kill
I'm just dumbfounded why my unbeatable logic didn't end it all.
13LOL
6well
http://sareii.deviantart.com/#/d39uczw <-- you suck ;A;
6too bad
6as i just said
6several times
13I just thought of something
That plush is <3
07besides, if there
13Congradulations you just been promoted to censorship. Call right now
07was no kill then the rule wouldnt be enforced as strictly
07if the mods arent there always
07orrr
07may be tempted to be more liberal
07just...
07yeah z.z
07it's there for a reason
07No.
6kill remains
07We can't count on people actually caring
07really
07just don't swear and you're good.
x.x
I am only here because I like some of the people on this channel and they ONLY show up here
6well
6then learn to listen to the rules
if I had a choice I would leave now
Well, is it that hard just... ya know, don't swearing here?
07nickstr
07seriously
Not to be repeating myself but
07god LOL
really
07I'd kick you just for that attitude if I were a mod and tell you to straighten the attitude
07seriously
07No need to be all fussy about it
07and cause people distress, no?

*they're screaming the Pokémon's name
XD
03I thought Diamond/Pearl had just one capital
Actually it didn't
it did
it did?
I don't recall
03I'm pretty sure it did
03hence INTERNATIONAL versions
My Typhlosion still has "TYPHLOSION"
03the American version already did that
03UI dunno LOL
03-U
03anyway sigh
lemme check
03my router is being stupid
03disconnected me from Xbox Live
13hey drfywefy
03and getting achievement points
Heya DRF
03I'm only here for a minute
<3
drf
03I've hda it lying around
03but never bothered to do anything about it
03heh
hur
03yeah i realize that
03whatever
03ffs
03why doesn't the shift key work when I want it to
03not used to using my laptop LOL
I dunno
03but I wasn't gonna bring my whole desktop home just for a 1-week break
03so whatever
:P
03inb4 you try to transfer a Missingno and it borks
/me runs
03nah I know
04hi
03though
03there are actually "gen 4 missingnos"
yep
also whoa
03anyway
03dude
O.o
03ever heard of the Motorola Xoom tablet
720
03apparently it was just launched yhesterday
03-h
03I was playing with it at the Verizon store
x_x
03see
03stupid
also I saw it
03I filled up 100% of my slots
03why can't they just have unlimited
03-_-
erm no
Motorola did
idk drf
03why do they still have a fricking limit
03I mean
03Pokémon Ranch doesn't have a limit
03so eh
I mean you can't have unlimited data
drf
Ranch DOES have a limit
but it's huuuuuuuuge
03yes but they could still hold like 80 million Pokémon in less than 1MB
Because the Wii's data storage > DPPtHGSSBW
actually, they couldn't
yeah
/me cough
03no
03not even close
k
erm
03try about 7KB
...oh yeah XD
03anyway
03http://www.amazon.com/Sonic-Ultimate-Genesis-CO-Xbox-360/dp/B001G3AZS2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1298679612&sr=8-1
lemme open up a calculator
03and i'm going to go back downstairs soon to continue
1 mb is 1024 kb, right?
03yes.
03still
but, they also have to try balance functionality of the system
03anyway
03I don't care
if they just let you store thousands willy-nilly, the system would become impossible to navigate
03so basically like the GT
03S
/me hides
03anyway
yeah
03bbl I guess
k :<
03bye
Okay
Seeys
<Iskierka> if they just let you store thousands willy-nilly, the system would become impossible to navigate <-- exactly. This is why I don
't understand complaining about "BAWW LIMITED SPACE"
But now you can... and more. You still don't need to though

Hello.
jerrah
Like the amateur play I saw, which contains the line "Nicht Schießen!" I'm sure as well as other instances of the word 'schießen.'
Now, the actors playing the Germans were native anglophones. :P

I can't wait for B/W ;_;
Extralink <3
12o-O
10o-o
They kinda are :P
I wish that B/W would have at least 3DS support
like
actual 3D in the 3DS
12well it's not
That would probably change it from a bad business decision to a pretty good one (even though they'd be getting less money than they would if they made it 3DS exclusive)
yeah :<
it's not a bad business decision, it's a good one, because they can get lots of people to buy it before, then release a 3DS version after, and get even more money.
that was Gameboy Color exclusive
ahaha

Why are you here again? o.o
you never come here
7On one of my WikiWalks , if that's at me.
yep
wait where is that?
10which was removed from the menu
http://www.lugia.us/chat.htm
10as well as peas
yeah
7o_o
10Except http://www.lugia.us/peas.htm no longer exists
6peas exist o.o
12o-o
7Erm...
7Huh.
6go to misc.
He just felt like it..?
10Oh
She has
It's not the feel
She really has abandoned it
6I'll probably be next to go then
She abandoned it when she took the name WhiteTail
7Ah.
6so I probably wont be around much longer
7Well, that sorta stinks.
It does
7TST was my first IRC and one of the best communities I've joined.
7I'm speaking like I'm gonna leave already. O_o
It's no longer...what it used to be
the community was much different back then
6lol
Kinda silly imo.
:3
It pretty much is
No you aren't, I am :3
7Well, it's dying as of now.
it's been dying for months
6well I dunno why everyone else is speaking of it
/me runs
6I've dropped my activity over the past 3 months
lol of course it isn't
6unless that went unnoticed lol
even LLOTS has left the main channel
10he left the IRC
yeah
10entirely
10except for his channel
xD
Yeah
7Hmm...
/me 7asks the cause of this moribundity.
10It's developed over time
6um
!define moribundity
-!- No results found
6k...
10and recent events have triggered perish
6define moribundity
!define moribund
-!- stagnant: not growing or changing; without force or vitality
6oh
6ok
7No, not exactly...
6 well
Is why you would choose to abandon this when it's no longer part of the site
6you wont be getting the answer to that
It's still the community
13Happy Birthday Espeon
13sorry
13Late
6wait, was that at me?
6@ascendant
it's not Xeli's birthday
xD
read the topic lol
Yes
6basically
LOL
6I actually considered leaving long ago
:D
6I actually don't-
6tbh
10I don't think anyone does.
err
ANNIVERSAIRE*
As do most people
But we all stay here because we have things in common
.
wat
And we enjoy the company and chatter
6serious issues i tend to ignore for the most part, by remaining idle
7It's decomposed to scripts.
13oO_Oo
6scripts?
taw
o_O
/me doesn't want anyone to leave
6ok well, i guess the kill script yeh
XD
7No?
6fun
6efdgrt
7All the other scripts.
6my point being
7The ones that emulate activity and socializing when there is none?
I admit the scripts would have been my fault
There's no one saying one has to socialize with everyone just because we're in the same userlist.
^
6well
13I don't know why people want to leave here. I only seen a few events that happened but that it
6my problem is just not getting along with some people in here
6which, if that was the only reaosn, I'd still stay
13that be me?
6a lot of things
7I find most of the people tolerable.
6today/yesterdays swear argument a good example
Well, ignore those people
it probably isn't
13WHAT!
Well, I've said my opinion on that.
6as did I
6I also defended the rule
13no don't get rid of TST please
6but when even one of our mods didn't care about it
As have I.
6but now it's just a meh
http://i51.tinypic.com/2uejhmp.jpg
=s
see this, wat do
heh Xeli
7Hmm.
12hi Espeon
I'm quite simply too polite to break rules unless they're incredibly unreasonable, lol.
Hi :3
7Perhaps we'll have to, if possible, bring TST's values back.
13this is all hitting me in the heart
13at once
or forcibly bring the rule down on them
you're an admin/mod
if people hate you for reinforcing the rules
then it's their fault
7o.o
13I can't handle this
And people might go AAAW POWER ABUSE but really, if someone breaks the rules
ban them
lol?
not even kidding
7As the meme goes, haters gonna hate.
derp
6if you manage to bring tst's values back
yeah
6literally
7O_o
Well
6ever
7Note the lack of them in our topic.
6lolol
:3
6course, I'm also running on a slight vent moment right now
xD
7o.o
13please everyone. Please lets try to at least fix this problem
6might be a tad more negative than I normally am
6anyways
6damos, a lot of it is already done if you haven't noticed
Yeah
It's been dying for several months now
12heh
Well, the values are here, but there's more than just the values
there is
why wouldn't there be
Well, I'm pretty sure that I'm not a problem.
And heh
6espeon, lol
7o-o
7o_o*
6points to you for being one of the most level headed people I've EVER met
exactly, Iskierka
but cutting it-
yeah
Quan said it
13how do we make it part of the site again
7Allow more people to access it?
I just go with the logical option, all day erryday
Armageddon's birth day wat
it was already quite far from being part of the site, really
xD
12silly kitty
6it was-
6what Iskierka said
6lol
6they can still connect
LOL
ewwwwwwwwwww do not even MENTION SPP
XD
7But I prefer IRCs over other forms of online communication.
._.
or maybe you do want 400 people to join
Lol that never works out
NEVER
6lol
right
.
that is the reason why I left the SPP channel
6...
dot
oh shit

brb lunch
12k
13brb drink
6well
it's still here
at least for a while...
6seeing as i've successfully caused turmoil here LOL
and now brb
6I gotta go in like
6a minute
Lol.
10Hm
/me also yawns
brb
6ffff
6you made me yawn
:3
6stupid worrrrrrd
13back
I still got it~
12blah Espeon
12my chest is sore
12x-x
D:
12and it doesn't feel well XD
13I don't want anything bad to happen to it
And =s Garochiiiiiiiii
/me licks the kitty
12i'm not concerned
/me flops and lazies all over.
12i don't think anything bad can happen from this
7Whoops, RL got me distracted from here.
10Lol topic change and avoiding the problems at hand
12this is why i've been a bit unattentive
A lot
a little bit of drama
6ok well lol
More like BRB/GTG-fest, Sky.
10k
12this is one of the few times
12you'll see me as the positive one
12i'm usually the pessimist
it'll take something far worse to cause the server to be removed
12better take screenshots
13<nickstr> a little bit of drama< no NO
7I honestly would like to bring newbies here.
6quan
6then advertise the channel or whatever
Newbies are cooldudes
Noobs, on the other hand...
6but we don't want to publically associate the channel with the forums anymore
6ANYWAYS
7Possibly, if Arti just left it.
7Ah?
7I dunno, an IRC would die as well if there's nothing tethering it to the microcosm of the community.
/me sighs
^
I wish the !tstposts script was still here
Lol.
12TST liked or not
12*linked
10Yeah... community.
12in it's basic concept
12a community is a friendly group of people
12*its
10Friendly's definition has lost its lust, to say the least
7Eh, I feel as if half the people I was like, 'friends' with, aren't active.
10Yes
Yeah
10My friends were the older members
or turn into people like me/
10in which most left/drifted
leave for 3 years then mysteriously come back
13it does
Lol
7Hmm.
7Our leave rate is larger than our join rate, no?
10Absolutely
Sure
12right now this isn't a bad thing
5000> members and less then 100 active by me guesses
10It implies... well, every decision we've made up until not
*mu
10Good and bad decisions
10now*
"6268 Total Members with 196 Active Members"
12it's like draining inpurities
7o.o
/me dies
10Half the people here aren't dedicated fans of Lugia/Articuno anyway
10More than half, actually
13I'm sorry
12i don't think you have to worry about being the largest :P
its sort of a niche
7I joined for the community.
10Pokemon*
12same
I joined by random luck
yeah
/me pretends he doesn't hear that
7o.o
Nooooo
12hey
12it's okay if you think espeon is the greatest thing since sliced bread
It's kind of fascinating.
7Hmm.
And good, now I know my thoughts are justified
7Tell that to WikiWalks. :P
inb4tl;dr
12i don't even think that site is still standing
10YT, for me
Ze.. fanfics..
7o.o
7I came here from:
7Lugia's Island, which came from Dragonfly Cave.
10Quan, I've been wondering
10At any point*
7Nope.avi
7Went on it when it was still alive.
and there it plays in my head
10It's not alive at all now
10Faltzer closed it
7And there we see a possible future.
Lugia's Island no longer exists
[13:25:06] <Espeon> Lol.
[13:25:08] <Garochi> TST liked or not
[13:25:18] <Garochi> *linked
[13:25:33] <Skylands> Yeah... community.
[13:25:50] <Garochi> in it's basic concept
[13:26:02] <Garochi> a community is a friendly group of people
I have to agree with that
I gotta say, haven't been many people with genuine
malicious intents here.
AS FAR AS I KNOW
WHich is very limited tbh
XD
7Heh.
lmfao
;o
no
7So...
7What to make of this?
lol?
Going to make a topic on the forums
RUH ROH
and fyi if you think that's a bad idea I don't care.
Damnit
/me doesn't
You are missing gameplay footage that looks amazing :P
Wait
you took me seriously
I wasn't ;p
10Be careful though, NS
"lol"
10We don't want to cause wide panic
10widespread*
that's my specialty
/me mauled
But okay
Wow it's like there's a shark loose near a beach or something
"don't cause panic"
XD
Do it :D
It won't go anywhere.
10Anyway, hurry with that topic because I gtg soon

7Hmm...
7What does everyone else say about killing the game-like scripts?
Do it
10I say move them to #IRCGames
I can't really give input as I don't care :3
but if anything, move them to ircg-
even if that means deleting the OMGZ POINTS
7Yep.
-,

awards
systems i hate
7o3o
7Nice wording in that post, Espy.
i'm commenting on something i noticed while i was on the forums, an awards system
all of the awards look like petty bullshit that i'd equate to achievements
I kinda felt like saying "This is a site with a community, not a personal chatroom" but I kinda have a feeling that wouldn't be recieved too well.
basically
or lurk
Just another example of good in theory, not in practice.
it reminds me of this clan in gg2
everyone hated it
and everyone in it was dubm or just in it for shits and giggles
it had achievements
well
"awards"
or badges or something like that
the clan was army-themed
i just noticed the clan topic still exists
o.o
/me throws his 3 cents in
/me takes back a penny
07oops.
meh i'm rambling
07well
F
T
07MAYBE I AM YOU.
ohmai
07JUST IN AMERICA.
07o.o!!
Leave army-themed clans for clans for FPS's
I wouldn't mind :3cccccccccccccccccccc
:p
mysteries

yeah they're working on 2.3 and it's pretty good at the moment

7o_o
7Really, now?
yes
Of all people
7What trolls?
"all the stupid trolls"
As in plural
noobs =/= trolls

07well
quany

:/
when you went in #brawl to avoid them
don't you?
07I still say that it should go back onto the site

[16:52:51] <drf|laptop> since Arti would just leave to go on vacation and Nest would die 27.5 times, you know?
yeah that...it would die
nini :<
03I mean, if my server dies, it's not like I could actually fix it, but I could at least try to
03and deloop it if needed
03speaking of which

drf
03junh1024-XD, you made this FLAC slightly too fast XD

03but whtaever
I had to guess a constant BPM.
03OK

03I've gotten used to yours being too fast LOL

irc.lugia.us
03when someone types irc.lugia.us
03where it directs
03for example
nest or ocean
(DNS pool)
directs to 2 IPs
03and we know it won't be back for a while
03we could just take it off
03and good IRC admins keep control over that

03so you just opened the MIDI in Garage Band and it played it fine?
yep, i made a few settings & instrument changes
i set maximum instruments to 64.
"CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES ARE REPORTED TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES!"

03>local authorities
03hm, but it can't be exported back as midi?
through logic express
<drf|laptop> >local authorities
anyway, you can use any midi seqiencer to combine 16-track to say, 4-track or something, right?
"I shall report it to the sydney police since they're my local authorities!"
03um
03I have no idea
03I just take MIDIs and open them
if you do one, note events may overlap and conflict with each other.
03and for editing I just open them
"They'll do something about some random person in Michigan!"

right?
if you need to deal with annoying retards then no, it's not fun
otherwise it's usually okay
uhmm, it's not like a forum, but as a site for my dad's company
thats way diffirent and harder than a (simple) forum site
>assuming that I'm an idiot
I was kidding before and being sarcastic but that's not hard
not if you do that for a longer time
considering that I enjoy helping others and programming I don't mind it
lol
meh, i'm still learning how to program
next year, i have ITTL as subject on school, thats where the Theoretical ICT kicks ini
ITTL?
yea, a special ICT subject for the Theoratical learning way
but thats how we call it over here, alot of differences
but it all comes down on the same thing anyway

oh, hiya Quan
7Hey, lightumbreon.
yup
7I was reminded about mymapagainstyourcash's remixes.
my recommendation for TF2 remixes go out after DWL1993
in fact, i'm listening to it now
7Sounds pretty good.
7I also have a strange preference to 'Erectin' a River'. O.o
yea, that one from wazgul, eh?
it's pretty good
7It's just sorta loony but cool at the same time. :P
yes, i have a really good one here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGzAenU-EM&feature=related
7He made a remix of Piece of P---? O_o
yup, it's hilarious!
/me 7snirks.
7Oh yeah, that vid I've seen.
7Hmm...
don't rush it, i've got plenty of time!
7o.o
i figured
7Anywhoo, it manages to make rhyming dialogue in song form.
7There's also mastgrr.
7http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcmVbhpJI8A <-- I've mentioned before I'm a sucker for orchestral remixes.
wait wait wait, YOU made this?
7No.
must have misread something
still nice though
7Nope.avi
lol, ok
7Amazing, isn't it?
it is
7I don't have any videos that I'd upload.
well, i do, not too often, but yes
7On a sorta-random note, my favorite of TF2 remixes must be http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B82g0eQWTYI
7But back to the discussion.
7I don't find too much use for an account on a site I don't actively use.

mhm
/me debates on whether or not to post
02I probably won't post
7If you think it'd help or hinder this dilemma.
02I fear that if I say anything, I'll get ridiculed
10I'm a forum mod for god's sake
10I idle most of the time
7We're all tense about each other's opinions, are we?
/me planned on saying something along those lines in her post
02No, I have that fear when I post anything on any forum thread
soooooo
No need to. If someone ridicules you, they are totaly idiots in this case.
02Yes, maybe in this case
7We're not gonna get off this case unanimously, it seems.
7Well, you're a member of the community.
02Really?
7Would you isolate yourself?
6this whole thing is ablah
02Already done for me it feels, lol

7Well, there's the problem.
Okay XD
02Hmm?
7I had a feeling you'd say something about that.
6I don't even know why i'm posting
02Most likely both?
6whatever though
7What's keeping you here?
/me posted :/
02Two people, won't say their names though
7Okay.
7Not the entire scope of this community, eh?
02Nope

You should play Allods Online with me
7I dunno about that, Espy.
And everyone's "harsh" by normal standards right now. It's what's needed right now.
It's free :3
7O_o
10Tbh Espeon, I expected as much
02That's fine then
hmm
6up until now, a lot of people have restricted their opnions
6now it's unbarred, everyone for themselves
is it java based?
6which, tbh, is yeah needed
7Would you leave TST?
02Me
7Shiny.
;)
otherwise, you know i would
02I'd say I already mainly seperated myself from the forums, I come back now and then, mainly to force myself to be active again.
02Would I leave TST? No, I had too many good memories to leave
6wow guys
02Oh I'm still on the topic lol
7But anywhoo: well, I've quit cold turkey at other sites where I've felt I had to force myself to get on--not TST yet, but yeah.
7It's rather alleviating.
02I've done that to many sites, now and then I'll get back on just to see what's happening, but I don't care anymore
eh wait
7Hmm.
oh
7Well, I can't really correlate to that extent.

02It can be hard to fix a problem

10Unless someone on TST wants to offer
02Yeah...
6I would but I also don't feel like I'm good enough for that lol
02Pssh

XD
12God I hated that show...

12usually you can get top 2,000,000 at the 30-40 range
12How old are you?

12sunds lol

12I like em young

Thousand Suns
/me wants LP to go back to the Hybrid Theory/Meteora style
Old enough to count, old enough to mount.
03hm
Flandre's theme?
03so basically they're saying it's a refised sheet music version?
12;3
03*Revised
03I mean, that makes sense
03yeah
dunno
03UN Owen Was Her is another name for Flandre's Theme
agreed ^
03apparently
&DRF, ne more questions about owen16.m4a?
03I don't play the games
03well
oh no, it's the actual name
:o
Flandre's theme is "UN Owen Was Her"
03Sparky, I know, but "Flandre's theme" is its other name :P
We want it NOW.
…
6anyway, wat you been up to?
03hm
03well
03what exactly causes those problems?
6OK?, just Y!?
03is it just too many notes at once?
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jItz-uNjoZA
yeah
you want to find the MIDI?
'kay
12cheese
too many MIDI events close to each other,
If we had, that would be a sorry excuse for a planned joke. xD
got a hoodie, got dogtags, got a hat, got a wrist band, etc :P phone cover :P yeaaah XD
let me check some things
/me squeak :(
/me has the wristband. :3
03Sparky, I have the MIDI
oh
10wearing it right now
03there's a link in the description
03what I want to know
oh, okay
03the only thing
03that can play it
03without crashing
03>_>
03I mean I even tried QuickTime
03as much as I hate Apple
03it failed just as much
03even Sibelius the godlike MIDI program
03can't play it for crap
03>_>
hmm, it's not in the description
03<junh1024-XD> too many MIDI events close to each other, <- MIDI events are notes?
I'll check the profile
03what's the description say?
notes are MIDI events,
lots of streaking and image sticking issues
03Other than "here is a link to the MIDI"
there are also other types of midi events, like sustain and pitch/tempo changes.
10I was shocked to hear Waiting for the End on the radio
sibelius is not a godlike MIDI program. it is a score program which has MIDI and VSTi/sf playback capabilities.
;o
10or why it is even on iTunes to begin with
10it friggin sucks
03well

its a cruel cycle
I don't mind which OS I use... as long as it doesn't mind people poking and prodding at its innards.
its because of that plus specialized hardware
you try getting an Express Card TV tuner to work under Mac OS
mac os is silly
IF you could afford the card after buying the computer
12dunno
Out of curiousity
in fact that brings up the biggest thing I have against Mac OS
did it have a P4?
Apple's terrible price points
I would NEVER buy any kind of Mac
they have the worst price/performance ratio out of any computer manufacturer today
6have you ever played any Halo games (conversation starter)
nah, it was an AMD.
12nope
$1500 Hackintosh > $4000 Mac Pro
correct
6oh, they're fun games
It just has a poorly placed intake vent. lol
Mac on the other hand... can best be summed up as: "You EDITED a CONFIG FILE!? How dare you! THAT WAS HORRIBLE! YOU HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SUBHUMAN BEING! I ORDERED YOU NOT TO DO THAT! DAS WAR EIN BEFEHEL! SIEG HEIL! SIEG HEIL!"
which also happens to be the size of an unfolded paper clip.
haha
12so ive heard
eh? I do that occasinally, it doesn't complain.
6yea, and they take place,all in one years worth of time
mine had three fans and holes all along the sides, bottom and back
Also, the fact that Mac laptops are made in Taiwan by the same company that produces about most all the other laptops on the planet Earth, means you're paying for basically a not very well pimped Toshiba. :P
putting a P4 into a laptop was plain stupid
rofl
6but, not the best conversation at this point
XD
Did you build it yourself or something? I've never seen a retail laptop with that many fans.
6can you think of something to talk about?
It's like making a Trabant into a pimpmobile... sure it looks blingtastic... but you're going to get about a half block before the engine stalls.
haha
6can be something random, like Halo
12Soso
12Love
it was my brothers, and apparently he custom ordered it
12Kingdom hearts?
brother's lol
plus if you want a flashy OS you can just get PC-BSD
6goog game,but never played it
12:o
12You should
6I want to
and yeah pc-bsd is good
oops
XD
i had it turned off
12yeah
(I forget if Compiz also works on BSD.)
12i'm well aware how it lags you
compiz is pure win
I could not do that
lol
though it's 110% unnecessary XD
6almost all of them
6just not the realy old ones
is there such a thing?
no
sure is
lol
My desktop (which is getting to be old...) is a dual Ubuntu (ugh)/Windows XP system.
12Well then you could get them all I guess
6I could try
6but, no garenty
i have 7 and debian on one HDD, and another with osx86
And if you're wondering, yes I name my PCs.
:P
All after various ships in Star Trek. :P
the processing tools are fairly important for one thing I do
6.......
because the hardware equivalents cost several thousand dollars
12Perhaps
i've named all of my main computers "whirl" for the past 7-8 years
6yes?
dunno why :D
Currently, my box/box-that-was-mine-and-is-now-used-by-mom are named after Constitution-class ships.
12Yyyyyeees
(No, nothing has "Enterprise" as a name yet... becuase if I name it that I'm guaranteed to have something strange happening every half minute.)
LOL
6nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
6oooooooooooooooo
6fine
6lol
12lololololol
My grandfather's boxes are all named after the Daedalus-class ships.
6lmao
6lmfao
Project Excelsior is named after... well watch Star Trek III once. :P
it's been a while since i last saw III
or any of the old series for that matter :(
6hmmmmmmmmmm
heh
;o
the hardware equivalents cost a great deal of money even at the low end
i really should make it work for a select few
6?
because often times when someone uses it, 30 others try it as well
:P
Soom
6hello?
Ho
*hi
6did you change you user name?
I changed it
6ok, made me think you quit
I'm currently stuck on whether to name it Unifactum, Compactat or Concordat.
nah
(Which are NCC-2102, NCC-2103 and NCC-2109 respectively.)
6dont scare me like that,I would have been alone

we may have to continue this talk tomaro
6leave it, it's on topic, we're suggesting things, etc
I didn't see
timezones fail but yeah, it's not too bad
You can merge my post or leave it out
ohadjfasdf
6I'll merge it in

6because even though I didn't read it through, it's most likely on topic
6considering when you created the topic

03what is this I heard about some "no ew" thing
03I mean
03it's just a word LOL
6just read
6it's not the word
03I was going to say I'll stop going EW B/W as much
2b or not 2b
03I've been refreshing the page all dya
03just not bothered to quote and reply
6.....lol
-.-
you can do that all you want around me
the EW B/W thing
03XD
6ok
03back on hoshinet
6guess I'll sit here and explain it out
03which is ultimately where I got it from
6once again
03blame usotsuki for it, not me XD
xd
he was the worst in it
03I got it from him
03heck
03it caught on
uso is cool
03some of my IRL friends
mention something he hated and he would say EW *thing he hates*
03it's awesome
xD
03no
03I wasn't going to say that at all
03in fact
6understandable, but you don't seem to understand just HOW MUCH people tolerate out of you
03I was going to say on the forum
I found it annoying there because he kept bashing every little thing
6wow have you learned?
6ok then, my mistake
03that I'll work on not saying EW B/W as much
03now
03but
03I only do that
I mean EVERY SINGLE THING
03when people bring it up
6tone it down
03and recently that hasn't been much at all
03so
6drf, that's the thing
03I don't think *that* is the problem
03well
03the B/W thing, well
03I realize with the games coming out soon
LMFAO ROFL LMAO, I was in probably THE funniest skype call EVER XD
03that people are going to be talking about it
lol, drf may always be drf
03and there's nothing I can do to sto pit
03So I'll stop with that
03LOL
03I don't
03it's not like I return from AFK to say that
03and then leave again

6yes, we know you hate apple
03OK but see

03toning it down != stopping en6tirely
6it's gotten old
6REALLY fast
03I mean
03honestly
03and I can bet you
tbqh if people are offended by it then it's really their own fault
6tone it down A LOT
03that I haven't gone EW APPLE more than like 10 times in the past month
6ascendant
03it's mostly *other things* that I say EW to
03I realize we have less of them here but
03usually there aren't
03so
6and then leave when he says that
I ate an apple today

03go look at logs if you want
6just, keep it toned down
03I mean other than yesterday when I was like "Random, but EW IPADS"
03and that was me ranting about the Verizon store
03because I kid you not, they turned HALF THE STORE into an Apple store
6ok ok I'm done
03which made me rage pretty hard at them IRL
lmfao
03I walk in there
03I'm like
yeah, that was lame
03you have FOUR IPHONES AND TWO IPADS ON DISPLAY
03you have ONE of each of the other phones
03WHY
03Why do you need 4 iPhones?
03I mean, OK, have one
03maybe two
03that's fine
because they're popular
03they're all the same phone
03I mean display models
oh
XD
03like, the ones sitting out that people can use
03yeah
03They had an entire wall devoted to iPhone + iPad
tbqh I liked Anakin when he looked normal
03it's just stupid honestly
instead of the mechanic darth vader
XD
03I mean, I'm not even going EW IPHONE, even
03Now that Verizon sells the iPhone
03I can understand if they want to have them on display
haven't been to a Verizon store since my sister got her phone updated
03but do they really need FOUR of them?
and that time I was really just sitting and drawing
03I was just there yes[terday XD
03well yeah
03but still
6speaking of which
03I totally have the right to complain about how Verizon redid their store layout, don't I? LOL

03I was using right as an um
and I was like
03affirmative statement

:D
*subtitled
6you posted a prt screen
lol
6anyways
03yeah but
03the point was
oh

6but no one had posted theirs
6I was gonna look at theirs for ideas lol >.>
6anyways
He used unicode
Most likely
I'm using unicode
6anyways
…
oh I thought you were talking about drf
go ahead, think I'm a boy
I don't care
03LOL
03she looks enough like one
/me hides
/me chucks a brick
03I thought you agreed with me
03on that
XD
I know
6I go ahead and type my post up and post it
…
I just wanted to throw something at you
03LOL
03but wait
03Sparky
6no other posts
03are you typing 3 .'s
It's a unicode character
… lol
6but within an hour of me checking
03or do you actually have a "..." character
no?
6there were 6 posts
Alt-0133
03
03LOL
I have an ellipses character
………
03WTF
XD
03WTF mIRC
… … …
6because it took until I posted for them to post
drf
03isn't it easier to type . . .
6and even now
03than do some sort of alt code
not really
You still using mIRC 6.x?
03or whatever you do
6with less than an hour
6only 8 posts in total are there
036.21 is awesome
it's sort of like me typing acksf acksf acksf
instead of something else
Explains things
03you don't have a . key?
mIRC 7.1 and higher is uncode
6acksf?
acksf acksf acksf
therefore it can display such characters with no problems
acksfacksfackfs
…
acksfacksfacksf
..
...
not really much effort
GUI?
03GUI.
03as in
03the way it looks
Anyway, later
03since after all
oh
03IRC itself hasn't changed since the 1980s
03it's just the programs used to get on it that change
6hmm...
03and the newer mIRC versions look dumb IMHO
6wth O_o
XD
03so I'm like, why update?
03since it's just text
lol, see why
6my mum has the computer monitor sitting on a stack of printer paper
…
03and I really don't get why it's doing that
03unless
why…?
6I never noticed it was printer paper, but it's been there for years..
03maybe this font isn't working with it
6and yet
lol
03why @ what/
I like the GUI of 6.35
03I don't
03they changed all the icons
6we like....run out of paper and buy more
03which is dumb
03the /a key for scripts
03the s-> key for send
6WHY IS THIS ON A STACK OF PAPER?
03etc
xD
XD
6WHAT LOGIC IS THIS
6I mean seriously
03hm
03weird.
I know a lot of mIRC's commands and everything
but not x-chat's
03I changed my font and I can see the "..."
6then again, we are realted
6related
03but this font looks sooooo stupid
even though I've been using that for several months
erm
2 months
ahahaha
03hm
03I blame this font :/
03still
03Sparky
6oh...
03don;'t you have a . key>?
yes?
.
03yeah
03so why not just press it 3 times
heh
03doesn't it take more than 3 keystrokes to make a Unicode character?
becaaaaaause that requires moving down
:'D
gaaaaaah health
no
just two
03o.o
03what do you press?
03because last I checked
alt-;
…
03¶
03it does that here
03LOL
03oh
ahaha
03well
03try typing
03control+shift+ue9
03like
that's alt-7 for me
03hold control and shift
03before letting go
03it should make a é
6now we get into the area of health I really would rather sleep through...or something
03LOL
03The fun part :D
/me hides
…
é
03hm weird
6the weeks after aren't
03anyway
03Aurora
03why can't it be PG-13 LOL
I mean I could try switching to Dvorak and see if that changes anything
03since we *SHOULDN'T* have any little kids
03o_O
03Dvorak changes the entire key layout
because there still are
I could not agree more
03no there aren't o.o
6my views on that are weird
03if there are, then they're here against regulations
03because the rules say you have to be 13 to join >_>
6PG we use as a term, nt necessarily the age group
Cynder?
03well
6meaning, some topics really shouldn't be discussed in here
03Cyncer hardly ever comes on
03well
6that being one of them
03people seem to get annoyed when I make suggestive comment
03s
03it's like
03I never acutally say anything dirty
I'm the one
6it's rude to many people o.o
xD
03wait
03how is it rude
03o.o
derp
03that's not being *rude*
03o.o
^
03that's just trying to make someone laugh
04?
03and it usually makes someone laugh
03if not others get annoyed
6course, that's actually my upbringing
03but hopefully more chuckle XD
03hey
03my upbringing was like
03"No watching R rated movies until you're 18"
WISH
03despite the fact that it says 17
03NightSeas wtf
03you're older than 13, yes?
6drf
I am
6that's my point
03then there you go.
6a person may be odler than 13
03but they still act like they're 4? LOL
my parents weren't strict after I turned 5
6that doesn't mean anything other than being legal to be on here
03then they need to grow up >_>
03I mean
/me chucks a brick at drf
03it's not like you have to get the jokes
03you can just be like
03"what"
03but it's not like
03it's actually hurting anyone
but then you go into this huge thing about how I should grow up
I hate swearing a sexual content and such
03Sparky, I only joke about that
drf, it doesn't have to be hurtful to be rude
and*
yeah I know
03I mainly just say that
03if you say you don't get something
03that's a mature joke
03it's my way of saying that it is
03:P
'kay

03I mean
03the people at the registers
03I'm standing there
03and the lady's spending like
0320 minutes
6see

03going "are you sure this is valid?"
03I'm like

03there were only lkike 5 lanes open
03out of about 20
6...
6ONLY LOL
03Aurora, see
03this is a huge Target
03and all 5 lines
I know that was random but yes
03were like 4+ people long
I like it out of all the episodes
03they shoulda opened more :/;
03yeah
03target Greatland
03Ascendant LMAO

03I was like the only one only buying 4 things >_>
6people feel the need to buy out the store
03A pack of DVDs, a gift card, and then a Target giftcard + card
6which is why I wish we could have our express lanes open
the only reason ambernova's and shadow's are about a week is because we had to restart the computers
03that was all
03-w
because of CPU nomming
6but yeah
03is a U-scan
03like grocery stores have
03and like Walmart has
6how the systems are set up, you really don't have to read coupons at all
03I know
XD drf
/me hides
well I like it because for once the bad guys actually succeed in something
6which yeah
6she's just slow

03heh
03I mean
03hi

03we both make fun of me for it

03the lady just hit "yes this customer is old enough"
03wihtout even asking me
03I was only 18
03she must have thought I looked a lot older
03weird o.o

6and she looked at me like I'd slapped her in the face
03LOL
6she's like "excuse me?"
03you should have just slapped her in the face for that
/me runs
6I asked if I could see her ID
6she had the pen for the credit scanner in her hand
6and basically tossed it onto the conveyor bel
6belt
lol
now now people,
6she gave me the card, I scanned it, finished the transaction, and she asked "Now why on earth did you card me?"
why dontu put them up on notalwaysright.com ?
/me hides
6I explained that the computer would not allow the product to be sold unless I had the ID, as company policty
6policy
6she then said "That's complete BS (the full term...)" and crumpled the reciept and threw it back into my station
6I'm like lol
03XD
03I can just imagine Target stores in Texas
03"You want my ID? How about my pistol?"

okay
also ignore that
I'm just like, really high right now
nothing I say atm means anything okay?
well lightumbreon, at first glance, do you think I am a boy or girl?
without checking on the forums
mmmm, at first glance?
Other
eh i mean, Female
XD
hm, i've got a different vision on peoples personalities
actually, then it would be a little mixed
there you go then
Or Lucien
Lucien would definitely be taken as a boy
But it's from like...oblivion
and the correct awnser was?
I am a girl
pretty much
Whether it be from my nick or personality
most people think i'm a girl at first glance here
nicks say a lot of things about people
yea
other than my gaming tag
First impression?
mmmm.......
Acsendant, as in Playfully, understanding, Intelligent, Freindly......
and do i smell a little shyness?
ahahaha
it is?
But well, it depends on how well I know you or how I feel about you
yeah
You see, if I don't know you very well and I don't like you because you're annoying
I can be rather cold towards you
well, thanks
XD
XD
If I like you or you're one of my best friends
funnily enough though
-!- position or state of being dominant or in control; "that idea was in the ascendant"
That's the meaning of my nick
touché
derp ;p
well not really
but yeah
mmmmm, comes close

/me mauled
okay I mean
I would say you're a...
derp
want a hint?
sure
don't freak out, kay?
why would i freak out at that lol
I have a lot of friends that have ADHD or are autistic
There's nothing wrong with that
you're just like any other person tbqh
i know, but why say inabillity to take others as people
xD
well
nothing wrong, but that isn't me
as long as you don't use it as an excuse
I'm fine
nah, it isn't an excuse after all
erm
behaviour*
let me name a few
There's a few but I'm braindead atm
lol
me neither
heh
usually on this network I hate on all the newbies
yep
okay, XD
I just get easily irritated at those sort of people
usually I'm indifferent
but it's a different matter with them
sometimes, i am too
lol
okay I need to go

7Hey, light.
7Don't you wish we had a reset button around here?
03reset button? o.o
why?
7Topic.
i think
Nah
7True.
03god I swear though
We're just leaning
03Articuno must have turned her friends against me :/
...
03she was all "My friends don't want you there"
learning
03I'm like
03what
its not that they've turned against you
Its just...that circle
Yes
But instead of being here, its somewhere else
03what circle though
03all of the UK members I thought were fine with me
Same here o.o
7Hmm.
It's not that they're against you
Its like me and my channel
I don't let you in there
03also LOL
XD
/me hides
03but see
03I won't
03because I'm not that kind of person
Its just having a circle, and then if someone isn't that circle its weird
7o3o
03EW THA....OK I'll hold myself back
03but seriously why does everyone need to have circles :/
03I mean, I PM lots of people but it's not like I'm gonna go make my own group of friends
03in fact I tried once
03nobody joined. LOL
7You know cliques?
03EW CLIQUES
03I avoid them like the plague.
XD
Oh goodness
But cliques happen
03did I ever act as if it wasn't my opinion>?
03k
We should all just make a thread with all the circles created and the users in them
But that's a 100% bad idea~
Um...that's stupid and probably impossible
sooooooooo
Um no
No
10o.o
These circles are blah anyway
That's my point
Circles aren't just friends
Its a group
Which can overlap with other circles
Timing much
Yes
We were talking about you
Sorta
About friends and circles
Oh
But why kinda me XD
/me hides
LOL
lol
13Why did I think of something naughty with that comment
Circles happen, their openness varies
A bad one if most
03the people in the middle are the AWESOME section
13!floof
13!floof
13!floof
I'm in there too 8D
03but yeah honestly I can't stand cliques
And yeah....venn diagram is a good metaphor here
/me huggles
03well
03it could just be me.
03like
03my friends aren't friends with each other
03so I can't really make a group even if I wanted to.
Its not really a clique though
03plus I prefer talking to people 1 on 1.
Its just a circle
03go blame Quany LOL
I know lol
7D:
Yes
Bad Quan :(

/me gives her a punishment- No Tropes or YT for a week
7Apologies.

brb food
7Hmm...
Circles...people can be complete opposites
03Also LOL circles
LOLthat
That movie was weird
Though, I didn't see too much of it
Heck, circles can be just 2 people
It's just natural, there's nothing weird about it at all lol.
03two points is just a line
I guess with them at the right position, they can be in a 360* XD
03:P
03or a 69 :O
/me hides
XD
Bad :P
As long as people don't go all OMG UR NOT IN MY CIRCLE YOU'RE NOT COOL or something.
Of course.
Wait, isn't thayt like the same thing?
If you close up the 69... nvm
Back to the main point..
03that's a 180
03not a 360
Hmm, well I guess a circle of people would work then
03LOL
"Hey gaiz, lets just lay on the floor and make a huge circle!"
03LOL
03yeah well
03this is not the place for that but there is such a thing ;o
And Espeon, you're not cool enough to join my circle ;P
Yes ;3
/me killed
The thing is, people want the inner circle gone...
03gah that term circles
03too confusing
03because it could mean anything
03whatever
Circles won't be a problem
Its not preference lol
Really, the only way they can be a problem is if people get a feeling of "I'm inferior because I'm not part of that circle"
But I've wasted too much energy on this topic
[15:03] <%drf|laptop> 03too confusing < Agreed
03well
03Espeon, that or if the circle goes "You're inferior if you're not a part of this circle"
03:P

Oh Espie, you're a genius

12i didn't want to use a spreadsheet because then i can't sort them but i don't really need to sort them
i know in excel there are ways to sort them
12hmm
also, make sure that it has the equals symbol
12it does
like "=SUM(blah:derp)"
/me uses MATH and snuggles a gryphon insdead
uh
o.o
Un heya>
6since I can't get my Deino until WAY later
can you copy the formula?
04.

:O
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8qHif3nsfk
12:<
6also, <3 catch effects
But I do have one complaint...
The speed is kind of... Sluggish on some parts
6yeah
6from early last year
Hope they sped it up
6if you look at the newer ones, it's more refined
6since it's still WIP
Got a more reacent gameplay footage?
K
I really have high hopes for this thing :o
/me runs
6LOL
6I have high hopes
6since all 4 japan regions + 1 custom are being added
Oh nice~
Yeah
/me eehs
Rofl
But k
Also hm
You're not starlit
Or where it's located
Since most "hacks" are areas based off NOTHING
6he's got a team there, and it's nice seeing they're about halfway done
6yeh
But seriously
Is it really that boreing? *flees*
6well
6Oblivia, Almia, and Sinnoh are north japan
Sinnoh is its own island
6but if you mean the north/west shore, then yeah it's not been used there
I meant mainland
6yeah
6the north island
6oh
6almia and oblivia are technically mainland I believe
6the northern tip
Oblivia and Almia are north though yeah
Yup
(sp?)
6um
and you can relax i'm not about to cut her. i'm gonna cut the doughnut in half
6I had this all mapped out
6in one of my 100+ sketchbooks
12sigh
K
Bree~
o.o
6I believe I wound up mapping fiore on the southwest
Oh?
That's farther from Almia and Oblivia by a longshot :P
Also, one thing I don't like about newer Pokémon games is that, even thoughthey're basing the regions off of real places which is awesome, they're making animals less and less known
that has ALWAYS been done
Yeah
the very first region was based upon an actual area in Japan
same can be said with up to Shinoh
Isshu is the first to not be based on Japan
/me runs
That's
6I think I mapped fiorre in the kinki region
6whch is south
But.. there was one particular one I can't seem to remember/find
6I think I mapped fiorre in the kinki region
6whch is south
Heh
6http://www.t.soka.ac.jp/chem/CEJ2/JapanMapII.GIF
6kanto is kanto
6obvious
one of the redundancies in terms of episodes is a favorite of mine though
6johto is chubu
Ahahaha
6although, orre is on the west edge of chubu
You can wear Red's outfit
XD
?"
6wait
6nvm
6I think orre was in chugoku
And Gold/Ethan if you wear his
6technically, it changes the sprite, but the idea is just the outfit changes
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkFW2ehm2B8&feature=related < Wow
Hmm o.o
Hm, I guess it makes sense
6they have the animations running and everything
No I mean

White's sprite

if by python dies you're complaining about how it flops quite readily, use try: except: statements on anything liable to fail
XD
Python can be fickle though
I've also learned always do "with var as open(file):" blocks rather than the normal method of accessing files, as the normal way won't release the file if it crashes while it's open.
python is delicate but there's ways around where it breaks down
yeah
C++ makes me rage
python on the other hand doesn't
which is at least something I can give credit to it for

the weirdness factor of not hearing this on 1134 KHz would be priceless
plus not many Americans know of this despite it being famous in Japan
no
for Foobar2000
hmm, does it work with winamp?
no
Foobar2000 only
hmm, could you send me?
I suppose
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=2DCIN9WG
thanks
lemmeguess, did inu give that to you?
yes
that might be my KasumiAMP alteration
oh, no its not
ahso foobar does it via a file read
which is more robust than sockets and DDE server
correct
but more HD access
DDE can be touchy but it works
cuz my wimamp & MIRC config atm,
breaks on UTF8 FLACs
I have never gotten it to work either

How fast could it be if she can only go 85? :P
i haven't managed to top it out yet
170mph

I haven't gone faster than 90mph in my SUV :P

Don't think SUVs were made for racing

How'd you backspace in the window XD
Heya Rora
12hi
Perhaps
Still good though
An easier way to keep the "help" text on screen is to add the line "SET CONSOLE TELNET {port number}" into the pdp9.ini file somewhere before the RUN statement. Then connect with hyperterm or something.

04Nintendo'll probably have a more reinforced server to handle another wave of logins at the time of the US/EU release
Especially if these are all running on the same system
04And since Japan had more orders/sales, I can assume the Dream World is going to be safer here
Since yeah, both US and UK
mm, still, get well soon
04But
You need to consider
04since the UK's getting it first..
The population
04They'll have everyone log in immediately

10Didn't work
O>O
03you're screwed
Try shutting down and loading safemode?
And I weigh like an earth elemental.
03or
03wait
10eh
03try typing in mIRC
10if I restart
/run cmd.exe
10might not be able to get back on IRC
10no, Nick
Bah
like kaspersky or whatever?
10[16:25] <%drf|laptop> try typing in mIRC <- wat
10No, Nick
03meters
03<Skylands> eh
6Sky--I recommend system restore if you haven't.
03er'
03> /run cmd.exe
LOL
03Shadow_Lugia, no
it does work
Amazing
03System restore does absolutely nothing against viruses
Bad idea SL
10Yeah
6Does for me.
Well then, you're luck
10Where do I type /run cmd.exe?
......
/me barely knows computers
03same place you'd type /me whatever
03you type it in mIRC
03yeah
10o.O
YEAH
it works
10Same message
epicl
O>O
03:/
Gah
03then you're screwed.
10Well bullcrap
whoa, it blocks cmd.exe?
10All because I went on Bulbapedia
03it probably was something else
03be like me and blame Apple
/me hides
/me sighs
03well
Well... an idea.
03my sisters had a very similar problem
03we had to reformat
you got it off bulbapedia?
If cmd is being blocked...
Why not try the older more aging one...
03Creideiki, it blocks everything
10Idk, Nick
COMMAND.COM
10but that's when it popped up
O.o
hmm
03* /run: unable to open 'command.com'
Maybe?
10when I was viewing a page on Bulbapedia
03then again
Yeah
Oh.
Sadly
10and that did nothing
Good
Well
(XP has it though. :P
03actually no

Before the Winlogo.
Or before the BIOS
How old are ya PandaFlower
Finishe
*Finishes
03no, not before the bios
03that'll just cause keyboard errors
/me checks the calender
After POST is complete, and the disk drives are recog'd.
Then when it's listing the I/O ports - i.e. stage 1 bootloader - you can star stabbing the F8.
:O
/me is 14
Fail

Okay... killed the wrong application there.
/me yawns slightly.
:(
10Nick, is just says to "scan" it
jokes
Same
03it's really hard to get rid of
I got rid of it since I had MB and safemode+ Net
03the best way is to rename mbam.exe to something else
you know youll kidnap someone some day <3
03actually
03you know another way that works?
/me thinks Andres + [EnterNameHere]
03then install Malwarebytes on that

Query: Does any one know if mIRC supports DCC?

Yeah
Yes it does Creideiki
Most clients support DCC
04Wait

04Skylands

Can you use run
/me pokes back
let's see
yes
like type /run msconfig.exe
Can it pop anything up?
yeah
Good, then try to go to "StartUp"
Well, the installer might be blocked
ok
on startup
/me and his genious ideas
No harm in trying.
tab
Can you look for the virus' name?
04hm
04Skylands
As in ..wait a sec
04I got this thing called iPhoneBrowser
huh
I don't need that
04k
XD
04If this'll be fixed via HML's meathods then that's great :3
XD
04:<
otherwise I'm stuck on my own
04:/
i wanna try freerunning sometime
04oh k

vistrash
Yeah..

startup and..?
04not helping :3
046
after retrieving files
04*^
04yeah
well
04which is why I suggested iPhoneBrowser
BSD lol
Good Creideiki XD
I somewhata agree ;P
I've only ever used BSD with servers
04actually Creideiki
drf's server runs off FreeBSD I think
/me flees
OPINIONS EVERYWHERE
^ yeah
AND
NO
FIXING
OMG
QTTask wat
?
Quicktime LOL
OH RIGHT LOL
/me 6blinks.
stop with opinions plzzzzz
6^
I need help >>
Don't make me kill you with logic.
But, might want to try the registry editor.. later
doesn't seem to be anything out of ordinary
lol
nice ^-^
04yeah
heya
04Ascendant I suggested that
She said no I think
:p
okay well brb
04[16:36:27] That way you can back up anything you wish to keep
04huh
lol
04.
04Skylands is on iPoh
04Pod
04:E
yeh
it would download to the iPod not comp
Wait, yeah
:/
Hm
It's not a download though, it's a step-by-step thing.
I'll TRY system restore, though it's bound not to work
because most viruses and pretty much all trojans "phone home" in order to function
Yeah, it was especially fun for when I went skinny dipping there while basically unconcious.
04Espy
04That link
04It might work :D
04try it SKy
Vodka does not go well with beer....
on my iPod?
NS :3
o.o
04No
/me huggles
XD
well
04|D
:O
I went in safe mod
Hai *says it kirby style*
I think you did it slightly wrong o.o
04...
/me has redbull and beer
04You need safe mode with networking
Did you select with networking option
04it's a different-
Difference
04skylands
LOLM XD
04with networking
k
Well, that is why we can't do anything
04:>
F8 and press down
04Yay problem is closer to being solved
Then once you highlighted "Safe Boot With Networking" and enter XD
something I feel good about knowing XD
and Sneas
dajfshdf
/me hugs back
04|D
Because I pretty much took a sip between every sentence that I contributed to the conversation and every now and then when I didn't
The rest of the night I was lying on my back, occasionally mumbling something in an attempt to contribute to conversation
XD
w00t
Fell onto some pile of rocks somewhen
That night
I can get on
lol wut
XD
Hiya
for now
Only scratched some skin luckily.

Plus update
You should do that to MB too XD
(Once it is on)
did anyone read the book that was then, this is now?
that is a REALLY strong book
lol
10Should I perform a scan?
Yes, perform a scan.
yeah
a lot
and he finds out that it was his brother that was selling it
XD
10quick or full?
FULL
Full
I'd go with full Lol
and he goes to jail
Durr ;D
derp
yeah
same with BSD
04mew
Macs can get viruses too~
(on acid)
well macs are...lol
:O Acid
?
10Probably the first time system restore actually worked
04Espeon
just not on acid
yeah
04Such minority is for geeks
or meth
6Wallah.
Very
That's a stereotype lol.
eew meth
04Geeks don't have much to take except computer parts
derp
and lol
my teacher was like "linux is an old geek language"
04theifs do not wish to take computers; they want their IDENTITIES
04XD
Because fewer people use it as I just said lol
and I'm like "loool"
huh?
i know a place where people always sell
i've got a hello kitty bowl from japan ^-^
LOL i should!
i need to clean it sometime
:O

crap*
Good :3
1036k scanned, no infections thus far
heh
And the other was a BSD boffin.
10or zero changes to 1
36K is nothing XD
D:
/me jinxed it
10D:
/me cries
and suddenly INFECTIONS EVERYWHERE. Happened to me.
took 30 mins XD
I had like
g
actually probably more
/me hugs Sky :3
10:P
lol
this*
Oh mai, my laptop is very clean
especially since it was restricted to minicomputers and mainframes for the longest time
PandaFlower: do you have a blackberry?
unix is awesome
droid
D:
04heh
i don't like blackberries
And the BSD hopper is more in the middle between "desktops everywhere" and "minis + terminals are the shiznit."
/me has the torch
i hate butt dialing
/me has a dumbphone of ancient times :o
At least it takes pictures.
butt dialing??
Andres: lol
04lulz
dialing with my butt silly
80% of the TAs however...
Well 80% of the TAs are Mac users.
ew ;)
Pictures like this! http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/20832_1212026240873_1835297489_395903_3622942_n.jpg
And the other 1% uses Xubuntu
lol Xubuntu
lol
That is the place I go to swim actually :3
lol distro #9000
terminal is awesome
thats pretty cool
ooh where is that?
terminal > cmd
anyway
is that is ethiopia
?
elbonia?
Xubuntu somehow reminds me of Archlinux
No, Estonia :p
XD
dunno why
Northern Europe not Africa.
lol
They're a TA. Do you think they have money? :P
right ;)
What's a TA ;P
http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/35573_1213257911664_1835297489_398624_3654885_n.jpg
Kubuntu uses KDE
yeah
EXTERMINATEß EXTERMINATE
Xubuntu uses xfce
I like KDE.
Look at those bohemians! http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/11452_1096414390649_1835297489_190168_2003990_n.jpg
Gnome isn't too bad
xfce is meh
let's try that again
KDE is...just...lol
Though I kind of liked CDE. :P
heh
Èxtérminätè
/me pokes Sneas to PM
EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!
ethiopia has its own language
?
XD
debian is ool
cool
I have only used parted magic XD
That was decent
and debian
Mostly because I find it's not as "user-friendly" (read "made for people with low IQs") as the *untus.
no
have you O.o
XD
omg!
Plus it's the only thing I've got running on a System/390 mainframe! :P
ubuntu is meh
lmfao
:)
i'm watching it right now :3
imo BSD is the best for servers
(It's also about the only affordable software for an S/390... if you're a hobbyist.)
people seem to like using centos for servers and I'm like "ew centos" lol
CentOS is a pain
"I'd like to run MVS/390?" "Twenty-five thousand dollar, yearly license." "!!!!!"
x.x
haha
That's why mainframes for hobbies... aren't fun. :P
Unless you like hacking obtuse IBM code to bork their license thing.
LOL
And you find a company that'll let you "error check" their install media...
haha IBM lol
I have no clue about Ethiopia, never been there.
WATSON
;o
My school uses ThinkVision/IBM computers
wait ThinkVision is lenovo
Eestil on loomulikult oma keel, ja murdeid jagub kui murdu.
I swear they use IBM though lol
Which used to be IBM. :P
correct
Parted Magic is LXDE lol
And hah XD
Which folders sky?
10Hm?
10I dunno yet
k
10It's not finished scanning yet
10As said previously, brb
That was a semi-joke
and now they don't make them anymore
heh
tummy ache T_T
the PS/2 really pushed things further forward though
The IBM PS/2... was a nice boost... and also a gigantic failure. (Hi MCA! Bye MCA!)
And the IBM PCjr... was hilarious.
that was just a failure
Er go why I said it was hilarious.
The IBM midrange systems were pretty nice as well.
Poor army want a belly rub :o
/me mauled
._.
Though I really wish to go back in time and slap the designer of the IBM System/32 upside the head repeatedly...
bbl
bbl
hmm
Estonia has its own language?
Whereas the mainframes used the 3270, and the PCs didn't exist yet.
If the S/32 used the 3270 one wouldn't need three different terminal emulators if one is working on multiple IBM systems and non-IBM systems. :P
Yes, as I just said in Estonian.
Basically every European country has at least one language of their own.
huh
not england ;)
Right, because English and the various other languages in Great Britain are not their own.
<.<
EXACTLY!
apparently mibbit doesn't like daleks
huh
lol
dont use mibbit

04well
04I'm trying to mess with loop points
huh
my laptop is broke and my other compy is only for gaming
you should get a shell and just run irssi off it
04And apparently atthe end of each track, you can loop by adding "94 xx xx xx xx"
comps*
04:E
:O
i accidentally dropped my laptop and it broke or i'd be on it

I had to kill it from my laptop
10Norton years ago (before it was proven to not work)
I had macafee on my XPS700
My old high school used MacAfee...

10Unless things become hopeless
What's going on?
10Meh
You mean booting the interface for a scan? Or on system bootup?
Or is that AVG
On system boot
10No, GL
10I never planned on getting one
XD
10Though Creideiki insists
You don't really need it
(Going by my grandfather's mildly crap P3.)
Yes, you do need an AV.
10I'm not downloading it either way
No, MB shall be fine enough!~
Only morons, and mac users don't have AVs.

Do YOU want to be a Mac user?
You're calling

ooh she's still alive :D
That's worse than calling me stupid!

Meh, whatever...
10Norton destoryed my computer

Even a day would be interesting.

Of course, that would mean locking myself in a room for the whole day <.<
FF is meh
(And if I do happen to get one, it's promptly removed from being functional before it can DO anything. :P )
Plus, I hate the download manager
10I had one around 20 minutes ago

Too :3
Not too important anyway

Hhaahahaahah
NS: It was "Antimalware GO"

10Looking back at logs
10it was called AntiMalware Go
I just said that. :P
/me is afraid to get back onto Bulbapedia again
Why?
10Cuz that's when AntiMalware Go came
Don't all Windii have Windoze Defenderp installed automatically now? :P

I had that on the vista

OMG AntiMalware Go attacked my computer before I had Norton
Mkay
And play games
10What does? Norton?
No, AntiMalware Go
When I got it I could not go online for anything
02Ah, AntiMalaware
02Got that a while ago
brb. grimm isn't online and someone just jumped in system
I loled hard
02And?
/me doesn't get it
It lived
:D
02So did mine :3
And when you think you got rid of it. It's there
I had Antivirus 2008/07 on my XPS 700 x.x
02I've had no more problems with it
It was horrile
02It's been 3 months now
*Horrible
It was the piece of crap McAfee that gave me it
Never get McAfee
It don't work
02I have McAfee
02Don't use it
02But it's just there
~
/me used to have McAfee
10as stated eaelier
10earlier*
02Yes
10Norton was automatically installed on it
Eww free Norton
10I told her to remove it, she didn't
squeak
10but w/e, it expired a few weeks ago
Sueakes?
Free Norton is cheap and never works
o.o
The only Norton that does work, is 360
10Regardless of the type, I despise all of it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRsiU3-vaJo&feature=related
;.;
It slowwwwws my computer down
EW THAT
6and several other of my friends' computers
Saame X.x
descent freespace
I saved my XPS 700 from it
THANK YOU MB
6but the thing is
6I've no idea how it got on there
6we wiped the computer
6and there it was
6right when we restarted it
10Why should I?
10Malwarebytes removed it
It’s ID is that of a program
10I don't see it listed
hm
Then yeah, just use Malwarebytes
6so yeah
6I've found an interesting link between people with horrible typing skills
6and college students X.x
6all college students, most above the age of 22
14lol
I doubt it
6grammar errors, punctuation fail, no capital letters, spelling issues
04AURORA
04I successfully cracked looping
04:D
6one person actually writes like "i need 2 eat rite to balance my diet"
04:DDDD
6I'm like =+=
6=_=
lol
04so now
13Ew bad typing
14LOL
04or get one
04and BWify it
04and have it loop
04:>
6ANGEL
04Win?
/me 6asplodes
6also
6that's glorious
04Indeed
ANGEL :D
04My theory was correct
Haha heya
04See, the looping is controlled by being (usually) at the bottom of a track
XD
02:U
Saying “what kind of sites are going on”
XD
02Btw, I don't think it's NS's birthday anymore
Oh lawdy
Though my birthday is tomorrow. :P
04It ends with FF, signaling the loop point definition is over
</random>
you+
04So I made the loop point somewhere else
14my birthday is today
Lies ;(
;o
13Happy birthday :D
02FFS
6lol
14thanks :)
14thanks
02I hate it when it doesn't just reconnect me if I've been disconnected
04hm
XD
04I think I has an idea :>
14lol
Type a script trigger
if there's no response, then you're not connected
AntiMalware Go
6of awesome
02That doesn't matter
143 is mine
02Went to say hi to you NS and it disconnected me
02Wasn't talking before then because I was looking at something else
well heya
Yeah XD
14odd numbers are just misunderstood
13I dislike 3 the most, something about it bothers me :<
/me <3 7
14:O
I hate 8
I like two and powers of two. :P
“YOU HAVE A VIRUS” “Push button to clean computer now” AntiMalware Go used to say to me
13is that weird? :<

6Skylanders
6http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2011-02-11-spyro11_ST_N.htm
spyro looks...O_o
heh
XD
XD
10I might buy it for that reason alone
O.o
LOL
and yes, ocean failed
Ba
6the design
6looks horrible LOL
^
derp
they killed his look
o.o
10I was already upset when they changed him once
10Now this...
tbh I wouldn't even know that was spyro unless I was previously told XD
Okay...
there we go
I believe ocean.lugia.us just crashed.
Are there any other SSL enabled servers in the network?
6I actually liked the designs for the last series
02[17:37] <Skylands> 10I was already upset when they changed him once <== Same
6with cynder and all
02But well
n.n
Creideiki, island.lugia.us +6697 / use tst.lugia.us +6697 to connect
<Creideiki> I believe ocean.lugia.us just crashed. <-- It did, but it's back up again
derp
ocean has been very unstable recently
I'm now on ocean again
Naturally it's back up again, I've connected via SSL.
Creideiki, all the current servers on the network have SSL
If anyone here uses/wants IPv6 I'll prod drf to ask if I can install it
04Ugh
well, get it working
;o
I want IPV6 XD
Personal
because drf manages it? lol
Can't say XD
04Ascendant
Don't be evil
04Are you good with it?
04:P
I didn't know of the other two servers on the network, nor that they had SSL.
Now they've been added. :)
04Because this right here is annoying the heck out of me
Creideiki lol, island has been recently added
about a week ago
when nest was taken down...
oh lol that
I'm not too bad
but it's annoying
04trying to find the track offset
04yes
04well
04The track's offset is already confirmed to be 00 51
lol
04But the code is 01 57 07 00
Hm
0457 07 00 is the track offset
04but it doesn't make sense endian or normally
12no meow
Anyone over 2.075secs D:
but not THAT much
XD
04:<
04Thanks for trying to help anyway :P
sorry
;o
Wow only 0.218secs
Sexylag
nice
University paid for T-brillions are awesome. :P
heh
iirc ocean is on a dedicated server
Middle-endian...
04hm
island is on an IRCd shell
04wait
04what
04WHAT
a stable IRCd shell mind you
iiiinnn
04how does that work
04so wait
Try 2^24
Then you'll see how ;P
04it's suppose to be 00 5F 07?
O>o
005 F07 are the word halves. :P
Oh no.. words..

MSL's not too hard
Yes
You could pick it up quickly

6mammoth was a tard
But not smoking pot?

Oh Him XD
6it didn't have the same awesome feel as the first couple arcs
Meh, i like my luckies
cigarettes*
Ojh them XD
my favourite season was the first one

6cinderblock
I loved Episode 4
Epicsode 4 was the first one I saw
.
Episode*
/me saved one for another day e.e.
6which was the 4th one?
6I remember the first one i saw wasn't the first episode...
The one where Slade is disguised
As the old man thing
a few**
6the first one I saw was the thunder/lightning brothers
i got daddy to give me a whole pack ^-^
6...
6yeh that's it
6LOL
...

LOL
lmfaaaao

6I remember laughing til I cried on the inside raven's mind one
but i cant handle the non-lights
i wanted marldoro no. 58
6because it was rather random
LOL that one
6FLOATING STRAWBERRIES
/me has a sore throat
yeah that was random
vhj
LOL
XD
episode 5 or 6 or something
I need to watch them all agin
*again ;.;
To evil ;.;
6robin annoyed me
he's like Slade
6but hey, yeah
lol
6I acknowledge that LOL
/me was cleaning the showe
6also
6did you
Slade was the most epic villain ever XD
6ever think slade was his father?
Yes XD
6cuz I remember
and then i decided to use toilet bowl cleaner
6thinking that
yeah
6for the longest time
6I still do
XD
not noticing that there was bleach on the floor
THE scary part XD
and fizzing up
In the volcano
oh remember in the apprentice arc
and then smoke came out
when half of Slade's mask comes off?
lol fail you made mustard gas
then i called poison control
YEss ;.;
Eeep
6yep
6his hair totally looked like robin's
/me 6runs
and it turned out to be some kind of highly toxic gas
yeah XD
Did you die? :o
mustard gas
Please say yes!
;o
Could be like in Star Wars Episode 5!
Andres: yes, i died
lmfao
I liked Star Wars Episode 3
3 was the best out of all the firsts
but really, it was horrible
I can't remember any of the other chars in Teen Titans
and now my throat hurts a lot
I didn't really like 5
bleach + ammonia makes mustard gas
MAD MOXD
I stopped watching after I lost my 12GB of the episodes
*Mod

6MAD MOD
6THAT EPISODE WAS GREAT LOL
yepp

Old man mod
Like trippy~
oh do you guys remember that episode
Hmm?
where's there's a race for Robin's suitcase
YES
smoking seems to make it hurt more
i dunno why
well It was something like episode 40something or whatnot
/me hazy memory
for Robin's suitcase?
;o
6that episode was weird
yeah it was
6GIANT MOBILE PIT STOP
6it was lol
and it's like "And the T-Car comes 3rd!"
*riding on a 2-wheel thing that looks like a scooter*
XD
6lol
yeah
Maybe because smoking is not exactly gentle on the airways.
Speed buggy physics XD
and then Cyborg or someone always manages to fix it
xD
PandaFlower: i called poison control, they said it was gonna be OK
the teen titans series were pretty awesome
Andres: shutuop
shutup*
/me noticed we're all talking about something we can talk about for once
Yes XD
LOL That
Oh lawdy

Hm
hi Kosovo
Would anyone use ipv6 if I installed it on drf's server, provided that he agrees?
Because if no one is going to use it I'm not going to bother
IPv6
We use IPv4
it's the newest version of IP addresses I guess
[does not know very much about codes]
D; my head is killing me x.x
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6
Yes
Oh, I see
And nothing works with it XD
Well, it is actually rather old
Thanks for the link
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.
that's an IPv6 address
=D
minus the dot
Sadly, iPv4 is only 32 bit based
Be going now~
I swear it was 64 or something, can't remember though
it was either 8, 32 or 64
/me braindead
or 16
Hah
No
16bit for IPv4 is bad
yep :D
IPV6 is 64 bit
>:
look it up
i want a lancia stratos
heya
well
if I installed it, would you use it?
hai
Since 4billion - 32bit
Well, if I can
Since I would need to figure out how to get a IPV6 adress x.x

[11:08:52] <eXAKR> And I just randomly got interested in password cracking <---do you like watching paint dry?
In...50 minutes
lol whut
see you all in 3 hours
@ n2
erps
Lolhow
Nii
12dunno
unless you can solve million dollar math equations, password cracking is the electronic equlivant of watching paint dry
I always type it as eXKAR
I always tab his name
bye
How I,o
it is
Tab never works for me
oo
12i glanced at his name
Reminds you of middle school?
My attention has been lost
12and read snake
i think that i blew up eXAKR's head with P=NP
:<
I've got a bike, you can ride it if you like
12eXAKR
12you can't say you ever made a weird mistake?
it's got a basket of bells and whings and things that make it look good.
I do
Nothing?
Wait
you break every single secure protocol in the world
P=np?
Password= No Password?
I know
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%3DNP
/me makes it into his pet
pretty much all security works on the basis that you cant prove P=NP
if you can however, that means it wont take 4 quadrillion years to crack RSA
Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be efficiently checked by a computer can also be efficiently solved by a computer.
Okay even though that's informal I STILL don't get that
Dx
same
It's stupid ;P
in the simplist terms i can say
No
*k
HE DIEd xd
i think he's arguing with nikki's sister lol
Hate capslock
I never use it
Um
Wtf does that mean LOL
P=NP killing people
As I said
Math = suicide
you can check the zeros using the computer, but can you make a computer actually find the zeros
but the idea is about the same
Haha
D:
I found the numbers
lol
With my EYES.
/me flees
think of it this way
if you prove P=NP
then you win a million dollars
http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/explainer-pnp.html
lol i think i just heard nikki's sister
Rofl simple wikipedia
Oh wow nice
.
Why
Nah
because you broke every single security protocol in the world?
they should give TREE(3) dollars
/me hides
;o
since they all are based on the same principle
Be back in about 40 minutes
K
Math is really fun, eh
NO
o.o
/me squeaks
math isnt one of my strong points
i'm still on the phone with deadcrab
12hmm
Hm
/me runs
but think of it this way, if you solve it
*satellite
Nah
Million dollars isn't enough for me
That or he and a group of g33ks he hangs out with helped find it out, but they're msrt enough to know that releasing the answer would break socoety :3
Rofl
That'd be awesome
Well
If someone solves it but doesn't cash in
Or live comfortable for quite a long time
the proof itself is worth more than a million dollars you know
Then they could be freaking awesome
hmmm
Wait
since it could be used for decrypting encryption standards
If it's worth more than onr million dolars
*one
Why's it inly being priced as such?
Only
Whoa
you could also imitate a US government NIPRNET connection
/me runs
Yes :3
if the other guys didnt beat you to it
we trust encryption a lot in this world
AND SUE YOU
You: P=NP
quickly
I see it
I SEE IT NAO
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN INSIDE OF ME
ENDLESS PO-

Anyone getting Skyrim when it comes out?

Yes, I know NICs are cheap. But... not gigabit NICs.
XD
my desktop has a gigabit network interface built in ... unless you want one with multiple ports or some other specialised feature
My desktop also has (two) integrated gigabit NICs.
I see. Are PCI NICs significantly more expensive than (accounting for the obvious) the integrated ones?
heh
I have 2 PCI ;3
Or, mayybe 3 PCI in my desktop
I have 1 PCI, and 5 PCIe. :P
SKY *GLOMP* :3

just a lot to do
thanks for asking
I hate mIRC
Erm, my touchpad
My old XPs 700 system has..
/me checks
I found a wonderfully cheap rackmountable server case. :P
and I'm not sure I'll really ever need to upgrade the RAM or CPU
Which can have the rack mounting hardware removed while leaving the handles attached.
well, maybe the RAM, but that's the easy of the two
Therefore: Insta LANparty capable system. :P
Hmm.. one PCieX1, two PCIe and three PCi
if it was Jolteon Day then RJ would be getting special attention XD
SLi is the use I'll have for it
It's called QuadSLI. :P

I WANT ONE

(They still need power and cooling up the yin yang. :P )
Hahaah
Ew Geforce period
(unless it is from 2003)
RDX keeps forgetting we exist
too bad Creideiki is probably the only one here that would be able to use a supercomputer since you'd have to deal with entirely different architectures
Crappy Laptop's the reason
16bit <32
Hey
Moreso the drivers x.x
Since the actual specs of the GPU here (intergrated into the CPU) are decent and are like my PC's
Tried, didn't fix anything
;o
And only supports DirectX10
pfft
no comparison
(Which is another reason why I stick to consoles for gaming)_
PS3 for HD shaders on SNES! :)
EW Ps3
HD shaders for PS1 games i ePSXe ;P
mmmmmmmmmmm taco bell
Because it's fun
:O
Works great for me ;P
and while I agree Ew PS3 that's the only bad thing to the newest gen
I'd rather play my PS1 games on my PS2. :)
^Agreed
But I don't have any of my old PS1 disks
(Hence the reason for emulators)
=P
:P
DeadCricket: you listening to the songg?
Anyway, PS3 became epic since geohot/fail0verflow hacks.
And why have emulators when you have the actual consoles/carts?
:(
for convenience. And unless that's a hack to get back all the nice features they removed I don't see how it's that epic
There is.
AbestOS
Lung cancer
They were one of my top 5 fave countries
i've got friends over there
:O
You can even run XP/Vista/7 on PS3 now, I think.
omg
Bit crappy though.
I would think
hrm, not bad then.
still don't particularly like PS3 itself though
/me imagines Vista nomming all 256 MB of system memory rather easily
Totally, the killed the PS3 x.x
*they
Fail revisions mostly
hurp durp
They've just been a bit of a fail.
Also backup managers ftw.
Playing games without the disk and not worrying about getting the disks getting damage. :)

I won't need words
these people are just ignorant
I don't feel that Japan deserved this
I don't feel like hundreds of thousands or perhaps millions of people deserve to be homeless

it IS real
that might be why
my faith in ppl here and anywhere with alot of media is pretty low
if someone is in an accident here
and there's 40 ppl around
I have seen nature's fury first hand

they'll just stand there Maybe
tornados, severe thunderstorms, and yes even earthquakes
or just keep walking
i've seen them as well
but nothing compares to japan
for me
you have to realize how many ppl are on that island country
packed together
millions
ya
you can compare something similar to it
on how many lives are effected
I was comparing the destruction largely but good point
/me yawns
the long term effects are going to be Bad
there already was an explosion
ya
from pressure buildup
but it was NOT like Chernobyl
ogod
certainly speaks volumes of Japanese engineering

12Hi
hi
I just went wat
wishing that the entire country suffered a massive disaster
if you want I can give you the details
I saw
still
opinion != fact
12I don’t think anyone should be hateful against anyone :(
I don't either
well
you have to learn that haters gonna hate
and ignore them
being offended is stupid
12True
opinion != fact as I have said many times before
03see
03I'm not hateful against any*one*, just against inanimate objects
12So you don't hate the user, just the apple?
well drf
03yeah LOPL
you know my quote
03*LOL
I still think that but okay
03yep
12XD
03>_>
lol I get called a jerk
but it's not like I even care
see, once you getting into this so-called "trolling" business then very few things offend you anymore
03XD
03I've been like that because of crap I went through IRL
12I think overall drf, you’re a good mod
only comments from friends and close people etc. have an effect
same
drf is cool derp
03and now I basically never get offended
03unless people constantly call me gay
03THEN I get annoyed
03because I'm not, and I can prove it LOL
and my mum used to abuse me
03but other than that, call me a jerk or whatever all you want, I don't care
and throw insults (still does)
^
03yep
eh
03what does
I swear, I make a joke, and then people send glares at me like I did something bad
03ah

04No it was not
I have logs of when I first joined IRC
i lost those
lmfao
hang on
in like.. 02-03
i can't exactly remember much from that time
xD
other then that i was in a channel full of random users
I joined in like
2008
and they were awesome
or 2009
it was as if they were all hyper non-stop
oh fun

o_o
On the front page
woah
you see 4 entire trains went missing
and they were loaded with ppl
and those boats and cars you see
I saw
also had ppl
their*
Also
Newest estimates puts quake at magnitude 9
I guess the iodine supliments were mentioned already
HAARP
they were from the news sources here in the US
I find that bogus
HAARP in no way could be involved
I'm just reposting everything that was just on the front page of this Chinese evening paper
And just the front page
the situation there just seems to be getting worse and worse
there's missing missiles
just out there
that could get set off?
yes
it seems to be getting worse and worse
just as I said
i'd have to say
in a few decades
their economy was already bad before this happened
release of movie about Tangshan earthquake in China delayed indefinitely
in Japanese theatres
i think anything related to quakes is going to be put on hold
i recall watching an anime which was more of a japanese PSA about large quakes
the anime came out in like 2004
yet even with the details of the risk
they didn't or couldn't do much
about it
ya
:<
probably some random fgt
tracked him down to some twitter account where he reported he was glad to finally make it home
>.>
apparently alot of devs in japan use twitter
ew
ya ew
I thought the Satoshi Tajiri rumor was false
I heard about it yesterday
ya
quite a few companys have shutdown factorys in japan
even some that weren't directly effected by the quake
I am not surprised
its a safe bet
ya
it seems like the right thing to do
especially given how many are missing

Really touching
wow, i even let a tear
It's really images like this that touch my heart
yea.....they can't stop talking about it at school
i know
News bulletins are dedicating a large portion of time to it
splashed on front pages of newspapers everywhere
Every forum I know of have a topic at least on this
OK
I was saying earlier
http://estb.msn.com/i/68/4128EB7453F999EE73676354F5628.jpg
Respect nature, people.
9 = what's happening in Japan right now
9.4 = Sumatra, Indonesia
*9.3
In Chile, 1960
Interesting
1952, there was a 9.0 quake in Kamchatka, far east Russia
1957, Andreanof quake in Alaska, U.S. was 8.6
ouch
1960, Valdivia quake in Chile was 9.5 (worst ever)
1963, Kuril Islands in Russia far east had a 8.5
1964, Alaska had another, on 9.2
Then Rat Islands in Alaska got another at 8.7
lightumbreon, most people don't appreciate being called bastards, ahem.
Seems like the strong quakes happen together in a few years
agreed, pardon me
There's definitely a relation
And this is definitely not a sign of the End of the World
no, i hope not
Just look at 1957-1965
too less evidence for the end
LU you retard
it's possible that large quakes in areas of the world could loosen the plates to allow for other strong events elsewhere
/me puts on glasses
Then a year later they got an 8.6
2 years later an 8.7 in the same place again
Last year in Chile there was an 8.8
And now in Japan we have a 9
I could rather point out the fact that strong quakes seem to "cluster" around a period of years
it's possible that large quakes in areas of the world could loosen the plates to allow for other strong events elsewhere
good one Iskierka!

Yes, that
the 1957-1965 seems concentrated to Alaska
This one is on Sumatra
AVOID.
/me hides
But yeah, you nailed it
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_earthquakes#Largest_earthquakes_by_magnitude
Unfunny joke punishment
right
Anyway, look at that likst
*list
wow, a magnitude 9.5?
now i was thinking about the move from Camperut, magnitude.....i think they made that one purpose
or earthquake
I see mostly Chile and nearby, Russia far east, Alaska, and Sumatra in Indonesia on there
You know
After the India Ocean Tsunami
Whenever I play Pokémon
And one of them goes
"Magnitude 9!"
on my Pokémon
....that move is actually awefull in combination with this
/me hides
(going back to topic)
that wouldn't be too nice after all
That already happened
Indonesia in 2004, Japan now
oh
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_ring_of_fire
yea, that would be VERY unlikely
(it could hypothetically, but only in really extreme circumstances)
One quake along it could trigger another later on
mmm, a chain reaction could be possibele, but as you said, NEVER at the same time
or atleats, VERY unlikely
we do see chain reactions, but because of the stupidly huge scale we're talking about, the subsequent quake can take 1-3 years to occur
ahw, that would be HORRIBLE
-e
On why such strong earthquakes are near impossible
It's a scale that goes 1 10 100 1000 10000 etc., I know
logametric
where gonna discuss it
a quake of 10+ magnitude is exceedingly unlikely
frightening
plus holland
That means I'm included
Since I'm pretty near a coast
From here it's a 20-minute bucycle ride or a 10-minute bus ride to the shore
Most residential apartment blocks are much shorter
i don't live near the coast, around 200KM from it
Mine is 16 floors
The highest is 50 floors
Most here are around 12-20 floors
Hmmm
it would be rather unlikely to have a tsunami that high and no one would be evacuated
I live on the second floor, but if I could run up fast
Maybe I could get to the higher floors of my block in time, then maybe yes
i think i don't want to know
yea.....
Scary
i would cr*p my pants if i saw it
at the very coast I believe tsunamis do tend to have the wall-behaviour
it's resistance from land that stops them
well, slows
But when tsunamis come, the best thing is to run straight away for higher ground
they keep going a looooong way
you never know how bad it could get until the whole thing comes in
One girl saved lots of lives when she recognised that and got everybody to flee during the 2004 tsunami
At the end of the day, when you think about it
This isn't 2012 or End of The World
no, never
The problem is that this happened in a place with millions of people
all the radiation coming from it....
did the japaneese not lear how killing radiation is?
well, when they need energy, screw everything else
Unfortunately
Now that this happened, people are saying "better think twice"
by quite a way
They should really spend money and research on that
Iskierka: that's why I say research
I hope in the mid-term there can be a breakthrough on that
and that's 3 GW at peak output, midday
not averaged over the day
also area is assuming it's built directly on the equator
We ARE near the equator
the problem: we have no land
but most aren't
hmmm.
As I said, research research research
at 45 degrees latitude, which is approx. where much of the population is, you'd need 1.4 times more area on one of the axes
it is not physically possible to get more
Still
The problem is we are NOT tapping into it
1957 at Sellafield
*plutonium pile
Hmmm
But still, I'm not convinced
the radiation is just no good
the best idea we could put research into now is fusion. Totally failsafe purely by nature, as it needs ridiculous energy -input- to run - if there's a failure, it simply can't continue
Still I say
Maybe in the long run, just maybe
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_debate <- reading this now
hello
weapons? you're kidding right?
residual radiation from previously detonated weapons is present all over the world
well, BRB
I'm not sure the US detonated any weapons during George Bush's reign. And I think that Russia may have made more test-detonations
nice.
But are they still living healthily, or...?
(!!)
they're living healthily enough, yes.
harr.
/me can believe that, actually
I'm still not totally convinced, though I think it may have a place in our future energy production
But if anything like this happens -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fukushima_explosion.jpg
Boom.
Yeah, but still worrying
And that definitely won't make people worry less
explosions like that are a risk at any plant
also give me a few moments, I want to try make a fun little calculation
trolol
lol
assuming 100% efficiency
possibly slightly longer, given I'm assuming 1 KW/m^2 and it's actually slightly less, I believe
eya ecco

Chernobyl was an extremely special case

Okay then

Why don't you make the IRC network the main focus?
!dari
And, also NSFE
*NSFW
the IRC is a service/extension of it basically
Not Safe For Eccentrics
that and, if you have a forum with no activity
Well don't you suck then?
Procrastination should seriously go die in a hole. >_>
lol procrastination
doing it now
Same.

*in
I was supposed to be doing things... two months ago
NO ONE PROCRASTINATES LIKE ME
ohyeah?
I was procrasinating on my fanfiction for 4 months
No
beat that bitch
If you have a forum with no activity
xD
And, an IRC network with tons of activity
Lol.
You're not a website from 20 years ago >:/

HoR is literally divided into the site and IRC
the website accidently shits its self?
Forums are for techinical support, and asking stupid questions
proheristation - I've decided that means to put off until yesterday.
the site is very different to the IRC
Shiny-Ho-Oh (HoR's founder) runs the site
perhaps a bit of both
Hmm
/me shrugs
they remain as one though
Is Shiny-Ho-Oh male or female?
male
Gay?
Oh
And I am the font of knowledge on setting up bind. :P

13I also have it on dvd
03Altair agreed, but at least most of 3rd was good
drf
Meh, some of 3rd was good
Yes about 4th
That's suppose to be litteral living trash
Of course it looks like trash
03again
03http://i.imgur.com/2Qpsg.jpg
Because it IS trash
That's just a bad IDEA though
03that was also a bad idea
.....
LOL
Drf
Making anything can be a bad idea
But you have to realize
Nintendo's a company
03I know
03Nintendo sucks now
And opinions for gods sake
03stupid antipiracy crap
=/= facts
03they don't care about their customers anymore
sucks in more than one way
yes this is opinion
03indeed
03I never said it wasn't opinion
but if it's opinion then you shouldn't care
03Altair I know
03at least the Xbox works
Very well then :P
03unlike the PS3, that garbage absolutely does not work
MS sucks
And drf
03yeah I know MS sucks
03nah
03Sony is FAR worse
03because of warranties
heh
03Sony is all
The antipiracy is because they don't want people ripping their games and losing money
However yes
made in 1998
03Chimera
03how many times do we have to mention
But
03that piracy does not actually cost companies money
Best computer speaker set. Ever.
03it's been proven time and time again
is goldrun
Well
It has them make less than they could hae
*have
Heh
:/
Like they need all that $$$
03exactly.'
In a company's mindset
They can go sh-
03most people wouldn't actually pay anyway
They want more
03so it's not that they could be making more
Even though jit sucks
*it
I do both
come at me MS
03If you have WiiConnect24 turned on
...Today at lease >.>
03and can possibly start bricking homebrewed Wiis
Wait seriously
03it's fricking stupid
03HYep.
Wow
03-H
03inb4yes
03I do my research before I hate stuff./
03I have a good reason for hating the companies I hate.
That's fair
03like I bought B/W
Same DRF
/me returns
WB
03I buy games that actually make it worth the money
Same with Dari
wb
03but paying $50 for Pokémon Battle Revolution
03that thing isn't even worth 50 CENTS
03let alone dollars
well, with the exception of some Xbox games
PKBR is battleing only
they f*cked up oblivion's engine
03I know, it's stupid
03it shoulda just been wiiware
if they do that to skyrim
people are going to rage
03I was all OMG THIS IS GOING TO BE LIKE POKÉMON XD
03it's not
03at all
03I wasted a good $50 on that s***
I wish it was
;.;
03so yeah, products that don't deserve the money
03plus
03probably about $2?
03but yet they charge $50
03NOPE.AVI
03EW DRM
03unless there's a way to remove that DRM
03like iTunes
03I have a decrypter
why buy music
As in, they make good main-series games because good gemes sell
o_o
*games
03Altair did I ever say music
Again, I only buy crap with DRM if I can get the non-DRM version.
movies?
03stuff you can't get elsewhere
03mainly TV shows
03XD
03also
oh lol
03this came from iTunes
/me hides
03720p High Def
03of Pokémon movies 2 and 3
03you can't get them anywhere but Apple TV
03which means yes I had to spend close to $300 on crap to record it
03>_>
03$100 for a used Apple TV, $200 for an HD PVR
03but it's well worth it
03I hate this "Aavilable in HD on Apple TV"
^
you bought an Apple TV? o_O
03Yea
03h
03a used one
03for about $95ish
.
2012 seems closer than it appears
03but hey
03go find me this elsewhere
03:P
lol
03this toop
03-p
When Japan got that earthquake
.-.
03LOL
Oh yeah
03speaking of that Earthquake
?
03Nintendo was all
I heard something about the day being altered by 1/1000th of a second
03"That earthquake isn't going to affect the 3DS launch because they're all made in China"
That "POKÉMON EVERYWHERE?"
03I'm all LOL MADE IN CHINA
...
ROFL
03yeah
03they basically came out and said that
03true story
LOL
lol
Okay
03besides renting videos
XD]
Best use.. ever
They don't care if their designs get more rehashes than normal
x-x
03I was considering selling it off to some n00b fanboy but I figured in case they ever release more Pokémon movies..
Or if they look like retards in public
/me runs
They just want their cadh
Cash
i mean, seriously
Since when did this happen D:
or other exclusive issh
they can resell something like a pro
03since the Wii came out
03more or less
Yeah
NDS - DS Lite- DSi - DSi XL
03Dude
03DSi XL is the most awesome thing ever
03don't be hating
DSiXL is pro
yeah ;(
The "Nintendo Revolution" was them changing their ways
03it's like Nintendo's version of the iPad
/me hides
03but seriously I like the DSi XL
Heh
Same, I don't need to use my glasses when playing
But seriously... all they did was resize it.
/me flees~
And I can read fanfics ar night <3
*at
Still don't get the point of the iPad - it's like my iPod, but it doesn't fit in my pocket? DX
It's a DS with a bigger screen
Aka: Most geeks
But people drool over it
X.x
Well my DSLight was dying anyway ;(
Same thing with the GBA line, with the SP and Micro
damt,
SP lol
Mirco was stupid
AFX STOP CRASHING!
mine is...somewhere
The 3DS on the other hand has the glassesless 3D with a D-pad (finally) and accellerometer
anyone want it?
I have four SPs
3DS seems kinda cool
Yeah
Dual camera :3
D-pad is refreshing
Cameras lol
I find it annoying that you actually have to go to a demonstration to see how well the 3DS works.
I can take a picture of myself
IN THREEEEEEEE DEEEEEEEE
/me hides
Plus other fun things
I know.
I'd like to see how well it works, but CBA going somewhere specifically to find out.
Accurately
I mean
Blah
That's not worth my time. XD
^
Fair enough :3
I won't be getting it due to price
/me os chankill #True-Flame

XD
I know, any videos
Wii seemed great when it first came out, but did anyone just stop using it after a while?
I think it's because their skin absorbs the IR or something
I.
Homebrew on Wii FTW
I find that I much prefer playing games with a proper controller.
And GC controller <333
I rarely play games now, but GC controller FTW
:D
Which has been a year ago
Wow
Okay

Why reduce EV stats? o.o
Yes
Effort values
12yes
Why reduce them?
12in the previous games
Why would you want that...?
12incase if they were not EV trained properly or if you want to put different values in
Well
12would be really hard to EV train
lol
Now there's wings
12those don't remove EVs
12they add them
And ride accross the bridge
Get wings
Add EVs

channel, blarget2?
10how much is that Zorua and Celebi card worth?
its like 4 people
03and those are the same style as the DVD cases
okay
12i'm not sure
12probably not much
03but googling "viva elite dvd case" turns up nothing x.x
10Because I want to find the best deal
12it was just relased a couple weeks ago
wait, NS is on Quakenet?
Lol
I'll be disconnecting rather quickly
10though I can't buy from there
D::
12lol
@ blarget2
12me and my friends were laughing about the fact that the card might go up in price
bbl
12because you have to watch the entire zoroark movie to get it
10because it's limited edition
<blarget2>ima totaly get one more person
<blarget2>in 5

12because most of my friends REALLY didn't want to watch the movie
hmmmm
10Buy It Now price is $60 ._.
03ew auctions
XD
03I basically consider the BIN price to be the price
03speaking of auctions
/me checks the item he has for sale
12i guess 60 dollars is.... decent
03darn, still only one bit
03at the starting price of $10 LOL
07wow
12i'm not sure how many mall tours opened up around the country

07they aren't worth /that/ much
xD
10Well

03Umbreon, no
03I didn't see they giving away cards
12shame
03also EW
03the hallway reeks of beer

10Amazon
10XD
03well
03I mean, for the price it actually costs XD
03plus how much I have to pay to ship
10Hm
10maybe
12i should of charged drf for shipping XD
12when i gave him those games
03LOL
10I dunno how I could receive it before my parents see
03yeah yeah
10and go like, "WTF IS THIS"
03well
10:P
12what's done is done
Lolparents
03Skylands well
lol
10Yeh
12i sold it to a friend for 4 dollars along with a couple thinkchip pokedex's and a bunch of thinkchips
10I was thinking
03oh
03that fails then
03well
03I could just not put my return address
10and I could buy it from there
03it's not actually required
10oh?
03to have a return address
03XD
03it's generally just common courtesy
03but I've done it a lot
10and Idk how I'd pay you back x.x
03because like
03it's gonna come from some random person
10so they might think I stole theirs or something
10Probably
03hm
03I dunno then
03but I'd be willing to relay if needed XD
10I'll figure out some way to make this work
10I need a legit excuse

yeah
04maybe
10I'm sorta scared that my mum won't trust me
03Heh
04that's fair
10She always says, "You never win those things anyway"
10also, if that is the case
10How would I pay you back?
04lolz
03um
03mail me cash? XD
03or I dunno
i didnt know you were on XD
04loldrf
10Mailing cash is unsafe in most conditions
04my ROM is sooo slower than my actual card
03true, but I've done it
04When trading
10Using a check could work
04it ends a second or two after the official copy
04XD

03oh
03they have Krogers where you live, right?
10Yeh
Because 100% of all IRC is child molesters
03Kroger sells pre-paid Visa cards
Yup
03that you could just go buy using cash
03and pay that way
03XD
I molest children ;D
03that's how I did it in high school
04o3o
03before I got a debit card
04Sheena wut
Yet you're a child
not just Kroger but other stores too
03well yeah

10How am I supposed to buy one with my parents around? I don't drive yet

ever
lmao
i thought it was like a weird all joke spoof
have you watched any of the channel's over videos?
since some of his songs have non rhyming lyrics
no i havent, but i cant really assume any of them are worse
lmao
theyre pretty bad
and cracking up
you know how everythings funnier when you're overtired?
i wanted to through and through a bullet in my head after hearing it
yes lol
yeah, that lol
03*WB02(Drake02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
the songs and the videos themselves
people are like "bieber had a sex change lol"
lol
fucks sake
12hi
lol
I guess it was on Tosh.0 too
does that mean it's a joke?
or that it was awful enough to be featured on a website
or show
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
fffffffffffffffff
Pretty sure it was just that horrible
man lol
Either that, or its just that great
I'm kind of leaning towards great
dude its just that great
rofl
XDDD
it makes me day brighter
when my mommy drives me to school
o:
while we ride in the pt cruiser
i do, i dont know if i should sit in the front
or in the back..
wait hold on i'm going to write my own variant of this song
ahem
lmao
Word.
lmao

hes in the fast lane switching lanes
because lane rhymes with lane
i couldnt understand him
lol
its not even like
lmao
they dont even credit him in the title
):
to give the illusion the song was sponsored by some "famous rap artist"
lol

):

i cant get it stuck in my head
my brain rejects it as music and as more of a satanic chant
lmao

Please do not swear. You have sworn 6 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
03yes it's a complicated script
03then you need a colors.txt file

lol its hard to copy paste it when its on multiple lines the way you put in in IRC XD
you can use DCC
03well
03you could just ignore the 3 lines in the middle
03saying if my name is in it
03or whatnot
LOL
XD
03sure I guess
XD

I think you shoul replace "on *:TEXT:*!ew*:#: {" with "on *:TEXT:!ew*:#: {" or something like that XD
and XD
03http://pastebin.com/5G66Su5b
03try that
03and put in the name of the channel where I put #ChannelHere
okies
03and the reason I have that * before the script is for people using colors
ahh
its still not working D;
hoome
Which mirc versions do you use?
XD
7.15
if both are using 7.xx, it should work right
03I'm using 6.21.
or does the script need to be changed around for it to work properly
03I have no idea
You'd need to recode it maybe
oh
Oh?*
hmm..im gonna download an old version of mIRC to try and get this darn script working
03I don't
03OR you could just not steal my script :)

03well
03which is n00b.
03*serious
It's the default volume
03it was one of the biggest problems when editing multitrack OGGs
.-.
03was making them not overdriven
03I had to lower the volume a LOT
Drf
trollface.jpg
And you can barely hear it on a DS
it depends on the codec
03it's not just about "loud"
encoder AND content.
03it's all relative volume
yes
And the DS sound quality isn't that high
K
in the case of music not compressed to heck
ctrl
You're right
It's very bad actually
Yet they're perfectly fine in FL Studio
-.-
03what's the point of FL Studio?
03isn't it just like Audacity
03but not
Um
Drf
It's more professional
TRUST me
03professional is just a term
And it supports dls I think
heya
Plus
*heya GL
The way it exports .midi files is the required format for importing
12Hello lightumbreon :3
Or esle the tempo screws up
Bad
03eh
03still
:P
03that program is a complete utter piece of garbage
Premier annoys me
all that matters to me is the quality of the end product
I don't care how you end up with it
03Corel VideoStudio is the most "pro" thing I've seen
03Adobe products are BAD
03save for maybe Photoshop
After Effects isn't that bad actually
just hideously overpriced
12lol, drf
03but that's just because everybody and their brother uses it
Photoshop is pretty cool
correct
Illustrator helps me
A lot
12It really helps me
:3
03I'm sure there are other programs that do the same thing
03they just aren't popular
03but see, I tend to dislike popular products because most of the time they suck
03I mean
03we've already proven that like 90% of humanity is stupid
03so if most people use something
And it caused me a delay!
03it's probably stuipd
03it just goes along with it
Lols
03well, there are exceptions.
03anyway
of a second or two
03I need to go shower
Bai
I don't.
03yeah I noticed you guys swear on that show -_-
xD
!ew swearing
15EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SWEARING
03well
03except when it comes to sex-related humor
03then I go for it
/me hides
LOL
Totally :3
12Eww Swearing
03but other than that, yeah, I hate swearing
i swear on occasion
Same here :(
03I only get edited versions of songs for that reason
03it just makes it not cool
03I actually have a page I made

03I do it all the time
03I mean I say that IRL
XD
OR
XD
12For some reason, I've never sweared both IRL or online before
Feesh
I rarely swear
Only if I'm by myself
:o
03and I cleaned my act up
03well

The censored money XD
it is
but at the same time no transmitters
the processing requirements if any is done are different
Nah, it only requires 150 kbit/s upload or something like that
are you using any sort of audio processing?
I'm not hosting the servewr
I'm just "sourcing" the server, which is in a dataserver in USA
I guess something like Shoutcast or Icecast
thats a common one
both Shoutcast and Icecast are
you can listen at http://radio.mode7radio.com:8000/Chan1-MP3.m3u

Yesh.

when I said I had my own AM and FM transmitters I was not kidding
peer are you resetting peer connections?
OH I GET IT
lmao
cool
icwutudidthar
trollface.jpg <-- why do you keep saying this peer?
trollface.jpg
they are legal low power license free transmitters
under Part 15 of the FCC rules and regulations
How large is the broadcasting area?
FM up to about 400 feet
cool
AM has a power limit but not a range limit
FM has a range limit

12i hate DN
12even for me
12Is DN a Anime?
12yes
13O lol, I have like 6 episodes left of that anime to watch
12the anime was nice
13^
12then it got boring
12bleach
13Also Wolf's Rain, another anime I stopped watching a few years ago even though I only have like 5 eps to go
12not something you watch
12D:
12Wolf's Rain is <3
13LOL
12p
13Whenever I hear someone talking about Bleach, I always say it belongs in the toilet
06And filler
06:3
12i wish Case Closed still played on adult swim
12I've seen all 30 episodes too many times
12the anime is still strong in japan
12there is over 600 episode
12episodes
10Cased Closed made a good manga
12lol
/me hasn't watched an anime in ages
12wolf's rain is good
13I have a list of like 25+ anime titles that I told myself to watch one day
13:|
12a lot of things are unexplained
13Kiba was awesome until that Cheza girl came along
13then it was aaaall about her
13IMO xD
12The world was restarted
13LOL
12I think
13except in season 2 it's all explained to you and it all makes sense
12but why did it restart?
12Had somthing to do with the luner flowers
12And the moon
12exactly
12it's kind of open ended
10Yes
6'kay.
10Yep
12a lot of problems anime have
12is they try to follow the manga
13Manga > Anime
10I remember watching an interview where the creators stated that a great deal of Wolf's Rain is left open for interpretation
13in most cases
12but eventually they move much faster than the manga and eventually catch upto it
13I hate when they do that
12inuyasha was one of the few that said "we caught up, we're done"
12lol
10161 episodes
12161 episodes is nothing compared to some
10It has OVAs too
03LOL
03Pokémon has well over like 700 episodes now
03I don;'t even pay attention to them
10Exactly
03but with BW well underway...
10I prefer to stay away from animes with over 100 episodes
03when aired on TV it was more like 70 something
03LOL
03but not because of the seizure thing
03just because going inside a computer = WIN
03it's the Tron of Pokémon :D
12lol
It's PULSEMAN!
12?
03because they've been OOP for a while
03but for some reason the Canadian store has it
03well
03it goes "Availablity: Usually ships in 5-7 weeks"
:P
03I actually already got both, but the first boxset was all scratched up x.x
03so I'm exchanging it for another
03which just shipped today
/me just realized April Fool's is coming up
12Mr. T pities the foo
10Remember last year?
03last year they put "I'm lost" on all the bus LCD's
10Aurora set a bunch of people's forum avatars ask Magikarp
03yeah
10as*

03I mean, if I had all level 75+ I'm sure I coulda killed Kyurem in 2 hits
03but with me in the 50s, then no.
Maybe yes maybe no .-.
03with each of the deer thingys it only took two hits
03inf act sometimes I accidentally OHKO'd them

03MY F***ING CELLPHONE HAS A BIGGER RESOLUTION THAN THAT
!shipping
03my roommate and I were talking about DS systems earlier
I dunno
03how much the resolution sucks
03I thought the 3DS was like 480p
03but it's not, at all
12!shipping
;-;
03Wikipedia says both screens are 240
03top screen is wider
Wait
03though I don't quite get
That makes
12lol
No sense
03how the top one can be 800x240
.-.
03it's not that wide o.o
03if it's 16:9 it should be like 400 something
03also fail
03the 3DS battery says it'll only last 3-5 hours
03and since those estimates are never accurate
...
03prolly more like 1-2
03lame much?
Kinda
12yes
03Heck, it says the DS Lite battery lasts 5-8 hours on the brightest
03mine lasts like 2
03>_>
03and I don't have it on the brightes
03t
Um
Drf, the screen is 3D enabled
Mine is good
03NightSeas, I'm talking about height.
12oh

THEY ARE?!

SEGA should make hardware again
10lightning*
03XD
03I know right
That's when they shined
Screw the competition
03the 3DS has analog volume
A SEGA Dreamcast 2
03it's either too loud or too quiet
That's a good feature
03which really pisses me off
Would pwn the Wii any day
03digital volume absolutely fails
Analog volume
03the 3DS went back to the slider system the DS/DS Lite have
But at least the 3DS got 8 times the internal storage compared to the Wii
That's a plus that SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE ALREADY
And 16 times compared to Dsi
Wait
It did?!
That's fail
03well
For the Wii
03I had heard a rumor
2GB internal + 2GB sd card
on the 3DS
-.-
03and store games on it
03that you own on cartridges
Orly
03and then no longer need the cartridge
I guess
03but I'm guessing that's just an urban legend
That...
03BEFORE THE THING EVEN COMES OUT
Would be c-
ROFL
well
03well
03it's out in Japan
03but STILL
It's out in other places al-
Yeah
03though
I need one
03they're probably still DS-mode only
;-;
/me runs
03Quack
03go get a CycloDSi
Butbut
03no I'm not giving you one
It won't work
D:
03yep
Can't run 3DS roms
03well
03the CycloDSi can run DSi roms :P
But
03why won't it work?
03they'll update it
I lack a DSi?
I guess a HBC/CFW is the real way to go for 3DS hacking
03...
Um
Oh
OH
03you're missing the point
03it uses DSi features
Well
03like the camera
03WHICH THE 3DS HAS
Um
03doubt it
03it shows up as My Healthy Cooking Coach
Having a whitelist of allowed games
03:>
:3
;-;
DUN EAT MEH
I TASTE BAD
ROTTEN CHERRIES ;~
;
once in a Mawile...
03all of them do that now
Kewl
03the DSTWO shows up as Fish Tycoon
03and the CycloDSi shows up as My Healthy Cooking Coach
lol
03well
03they DID, not sure how
03but of course they all had updates
03that no longer worked
;o
03hm
03well we'll have to see
03but see, even if they did, the CycloDSi comes with a firmware updater dongle
03:P
Personally i think the way to go is a Custom FirmWare or Homebrew Channel on the 3DS.
03same here
03but there also should have been a homebrew channel on the DSi
!shipping
ddddd
fffff
Progress have been made though.
Hm
03so the best they can do is copy the boot sector of retail DS games that are on the whitelist, and then stick their own code in them
Homebrew channel for 3DS...
That'd actually be pretty awesome.
D:
You guys know how much the Wii can be hacked with the Homebrew channel, righr?
*right
Yeah
Also drf fun fact
03but see
03people still don't know the Wii's master code either
03they just find ways around it XD
03I know
03Dreamcast used CD-Rs
03with no copy protection
Is because the protection was GD-Rs
03so you can just burn them
Gigadisks
soumm,
But not many games used the 1,2 GBs
People couldn't dump them immediately
03the Dreamcast used standard CDs.
Then people dumped them xD
10!lag
4 Espeon is paired with Sky|afk
03o_O
It used GD-Rs
10!lag
03You can just burn standard CDs
03which work perfectly fine
03in the Dreamcast
It can read CD-Rs though LOL
mb people can make a Wii master code liek they did with HDCP ?
no see
Commercial games use GD-R
03junh1024-XD you don't make master codes LOL
10:<
o.o
The Dreamcast can read them
:(
However
03I just don't think anyone's figured out the Wii master code
X3
12!Shipping
03all the Homebrew Channel exploits are just ways people found to avoid needing it
03exactly
The Dreamcast can also read CD-Rs
XD
03well there was also Bannerbomb and I have no fricking idea how that works
Igglyboo made it I think
It worked pretty well
Wait
03same with the DSi
Now there's internal saving?
12Is !shipping off?
03why do you care?>
!boating
12:<
If Pokémon ever does that I'll be pissed
03LOL
That's why
03no
:U
03I meant about the script
03also
Oh
03that's similar to how the ESR hack works for the PS2
Still
o.o
03since the PS2 can read DVD-Rs
12lol
03but only if they're videos
YES
/me haunts people
12Never mind
03that way the PS2 can read it without needing a modchip
/me flies away
03it's pretty nice
on my V7 PS2
03someone hacked it?
Yes
03and the thing is, in order to run ESR, you have to have a hacked memory card
03which requires a modded system in order to make
03so it's kinda a catch 22
03what'd they do with the Sudoku thing?
10!pokemon
10Eh
They injected an exploit to the game's file
Brb
Sky, is everything ok there, youre connection looks like its flipping out there or something
03what'd the hack let them do?
Run homebrew.
04well
03o.o
03so there's no longer a Sudoku in the DSi store?
04apparently it was something that allowed the system to be hacked
12Bye for now, every one!
03or did they just replace it with another one
04cya
03hm
03weird
04well
04is there any way for the Exploit to be done anymore? ;.;
12hi
03prolly not
04:/
03rather than a downloaded one
http://hackmii.com/2011/01/sudokuhax-release
03well
10My connection is a bugger
03that does let you run any region's code
03er
03game
03like
03I Could play the Japanese B/W on my DSi with DSi features
Hello
03but, only ROMs, not DSiware.
03not YET.
04:3
04hmm
04If DSiware were to be runnable
03well
04If anyone dumped the Sudoku exploit
03it MAY be
03the problem is
04couldn't it be possible to run homebrew?
03DSIware is in .bin format when dumped
03the card can only run .nds
03The other problem
6hello hello
03there's only like 10 DSiWare games that have been dumped
That would ruin the idea. DSiware has access to SD
03out of the hundreds in existance
03all Japanese.
And the exploit supports SDHC
04rofl
03there aren't any cartridge-based DSi games that can use the SD slot?
03because I'm sure there are
04"Hello world!" on DSi
04XD
04also
04FEATHER
04:3
03with my CycloDSi
DSi cartridges has no SD access apparently
10hi~
03hm
03weird
"The main advantage of DSiWare exploits over hybrid card EEPROM savedata exploits is SD card access, *and* the exploits supports SDHC."
04btw drf
04wait
04:O
04Awesome
04Access to the SD card
03as the CycloDSi doesn't do that
03not actual ROM modifying
04ROM modding?
03sure why not
03well
03DSi ones, rather
03like the AceKard 2i
yeah
03Brain Age Express: Sudoku etrc
03*etc
Most DS games uses EEPROM
03exactly
Wario Ware DIY uses NAND
hi
Hardware anti piracy :P
03EW ANTIPIRACY
:3
03DS games cannot be played with 3D visuals on the 3DS. The games are displayed in a scaled and stretched fashion due to the differences between the DS's top screen and the 3DS's top screen unless the user holds down the Start and Select buttons upon launch of the DS software. <- EW STRETCHING VIDEOS
Don't worry, it's bilinear scaling
Not like when playing GB/GBC games on the GBA with stretching o
*on
03it says "scaled and stretched"
03which implies that instead of 4:3 it'll be stretched to fill the top screen
03which is EW
um... that's actually wrong
XD
03so it'll be pillarboxed?
03then that's fine.
03how do you know though, the system isn't out yet o.o

lol
4ZOROARK WTF
4did not see that coming
honestly, never go for under 500 gigs. most of the time, any drive under that size is at most 10-20 dollars cheaper, and with that minimal of a difference, you might as well go the extra mile/kilometer
I made the very same mistake and I am regretting it
luckily I had aquired over 3 TB of external storage before hand

It's professional, but not boring

They don't know how to use AGC
or don't use it at all
I use an AGC on my setup

I have a pretty good AGC setup on my show...
I actually have two AGCs
one just before the compressor/limiter and one before the output
I had to do the same
Yes

12Hello lightumbreon!
and we are at two hours and four minutes
thanks lightumbreon
Winamp is a good broadcasting tool. Often you don't even need to set AGC to broadcast

no

Anyway, in sweden unlicensed FM transmitters can only have a range of 3-4 meters
XD
XD
its longer in the US
WB
The government did go crazy about those MP3 players with built in FM transmitters but then allowed them...with that limitation
o.o
AM transmitters in the US have a power limit but no real range limit
transmitter grounds are legal though
B000000000000000

two and a half hours is possible

Kosovo, you are a 3Excadrill.
03yay, I now have all of Pokémon season 4 on DVD
03NTSC ones
does not matter
yours are f*** rare
and far outside my price range
no wait, not even 500 more like $1,000
03not really
03I ONLY collect American DVD releases
I don't care
I still have them
and they are far more easily obtained
you don't have to deal with scalpers
they are EASIER TO FIND
which is far more important than "TV system compliance"
ok
03these aren't hard to find either, they're just hard to find for a good price :P
03but I spent less than $50 on each
again
SCALPERS
03so that's less than $350 total
03dude
03$40 for 7 episodes isn't that bad
I paid $50 for the ENTIRE FOURTH SEASON
03it's like $3ish an episode
its really bad
03OK well I only want NTSC releases
you got a crappy deal
you basically got ripped off
03it's not bias
03I collect region 1 POkémon DVDs
03what you have isn't that
03and therefore doesn't count
it still counts
they are still official licensed releases
I have good inverse telecine capabilities

and it was SOOOO hard not to trip over little kids that aren't looking where they're going

03but yet everyone's going all ZOMFG <3 on the forums
XD
4how was it?
12lol
02It was ok
03if it's not Pixar it's basically not good
03in terms of animation\
02I liked the animation, the story seemed a bit rushed, and the songs were kind of bleh
4i loved toy story 3
03but that's Pixar :P

02Due
02Dude*

03but they don't
03so
03it's not
Yes
But
They didn't have that happen
>A>
03whether it was a mistake or not
03it's still messed up
Heh
03>_>
That's an understa-
/me runs
03but that doesn't help
That's understandable though
02Oh gosh
02I'd bet on my emulator
03well
02I lost everone XD
03at least on the emulator
03you can mess with the date
03XD
Yep :P
03but I hate DS emulation
02Yeah, but it's been 4 months now LOL
03it's just not the same experience
Yep
But
03well yeah
Because
03that's why I have B/W
02I guess it's a speed gamer challenge
03without massive patching
02But now
03well
03eh nvm
Just connect with someone lol
03don't feel like getting into it
03but
03Chimera
03it's not that simple
4drf, how do you convert an iso to a rom?
03bluesun told me you need like 2-3 people
How isn't it?
03that have it
o.o
03AND
Wait
No
03meaning they'd have to have their games going for a while
That makes sense :P
02Oh well then
03as the Entralink thing only works with local
03yeah it's stupid
02She'll beat it
Entralink is local
But
WHY?!
02in about a month or two
03dunno
02I could probably just steal off hers then
03again, it's retarded
03D
03*XD
03well
4it was stupid that entralink is loca
03it's kinda a catch 22
4l
Yes
I mean
:3
>>
03but then YOU have them, and THEY don't
03or they can steal yours
03but etiher way
my kitty wont leave me alone
03only one person benefits
03LOL
:o
Wow
But
03it's just stupid
Anyway
4rly?
4wow
03and as far as I can tell
she keeps meowing at me, and swatting at my ankles when i walk by her
03you can't even hack those people back in
Entralink could have easily been online
lol
02Ok Dream World really needs to come now
02I
02want
02Growlithe
I want Contrary Serperior
maybe she wants attention
nooo
i know she does lol
Yes
03there's no way to put those people back in
maybe she wants to be loved
03x.x
Not YET
:(
bitch needs to learn her place
|:<
03well I dunno
/me slap britts wrist
03Pokesav generally doesn't have updates

/me shotdead
Wow.

You shouldn't have done that.
I shouldn't have?
You shouldn't have done that.
I don't know.
You shouldn't have done that.
idk about that
:3
03yeah
03That's Nintendo's problem
03but it never is
03:P
03the 3DS is the same way
03I looked at the tech specs for it
03HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT
Yes :/
How about
03if someone wants to buy me a 3DS...
SEGA makes hardware
03but otherwise I probably won't get it XD
For Nintendo's games
/me runs
03XD
02I only want to get a 3DS for the games
LO
LOL
03what games?
then I think we would win
ya
03There are no good launch date titles
Shouldn't it be the other way around ;3
That would work perfecty though
you suddenly go ASLFDKJjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
02Pokemon Snap 2
03yeah, Sega's always had the upper hand in hardware
yes
With
*runs*
XD
/me sobs
03Shiny-Growlithe
I perfer SNES because of the games :3
SEGA also wasn't all "GRAHH CHEAT GENIE"
03did you get Snap on Wii?
O.o
...
02No, I can't buy things on the Wii
03oh
02I have no money LOL
03well
03you should
03because
example being color portables
02It's awesome? :P
03they actually made a couple changes to it
Horrible lie
HORRIBLE
LIE
03so instead of straight emulation
03if you hit the - key
03:P
Then again
but they were ALREADY beaten by Atari, NEC, and Sega
03just install Homebrew Channel
03and use the WAD installer
03:P
That's funny/weird because of some creepy pasta.
03heh
03if you do it right it's fine
Hm
02Exactly!
02I can't do anything right .-.
heh reminds me of that skype status icon with the pencel, it can turn into a cat sometimes if you have gibberish on the screen
Go back in time
03LOL
It must have got it from people using it.
03well
03I hacked my Wii back when it was Twilight Hack
03which was like the easiest thing ever
03now it's a bit more complicated
/me hides
03Chimera, just make me a time machine
I did bannerbomb
03Bannerbomb was easy too but that no longer works either
Of course
Wait
It doesn't?
03no
Oh wait no
03the newest Wii system menu broke it again
It doesn't ;-;
Well
03this time for good
Drf
03now you have to use some other thing
Yes ;.;
plus the Gameboy Color sucked in terms of its screen
03what
Brawl
03yeah
03I know
It has a permanant exploit
Yay~
Stacksmash ;D
^
No
the colors looked washed out and dull
03LOL
it was a HUGE disappointment
03same idea
03well
Stacksmash is a texture hacking team LOL
Yes ><
I don't even have brawl
But
Worse games
02Oh well

I used to go to #SPP a while back, but a lot of the time, you just had to be a part of the forums as well to really get to know anybody on that channel
SPP as in Serebii's channel
03EW SEREBII
yeah i know
there's a reason I left
/me sees that #SSP is for sale
but I was there before D/P came out
13SPP*
03and now Derezzed is playing
03in the movie
back when the channel averaged maybe 70 people on a good day
before #SPP-Wifi

12team aqua and magma were idiots
Well
Yeah
Bree not really
They were like
Teorrorists
XD
*Terrorists
12lol
03all the groups are
No
Team Plamsa are extreamists
03organized crime = "terrorists"
12didn't have some sort of single minded motivation
12they were just "crime, crime, and more crime"
Wait
12that's why i liked them
Yeah
They wanted to just take over Sliph and be jearks
12all the other teams
12were a one trick pony with a goal in mind
Magma and Aqua wanted to expand the pand/water
12which irritated me
*land
12pand
Bree
12XD
Magma had a good idea
They wanted more landmass for the creatures that lived on the land
Aqua wanted more sea

03this?
yes
thats it!
03I hear Eat It
03ew, this is horrible quality
03it's > 0
but back then they were the flagship for the now defunct Kids Star radio network
most people have sh1t AM radios
03different recording
I would still like to hear both though
as far as I am concerned they are part of Pacific Northwest radio history
heh
03he converted a 192kbps mp3 into FLAC
03Why
03why not just have it mp3 >_>
03you gain nothing by doing that
it's an awesome piece
03he clearly gave it to me anyway
heya lightumbreon
and haha
03like I said he's an idiot
03he literally burned me 4.2GB of FLACs to a DVD-R and sent it in the mail

03I contacted some Channel 955 people via email
PRICELESS!

03bluesun gave me this one XD
03but this isn't edited at all AFAIK
03I like the "holy jeez!" edit
you want to see a crowded ATSC multicast that would be in my area KNMT-DT 45
03faster and higher pitched
no less than FIVE SD channels
03wow
I am not kidding
03I generally don't need to worry about that since my cable relays them all to me
why they packed that many streams into one 6 MHz channel is beyond me
03to be cheap
because the quality is not that great
as you would imagine
issues with blocking at times
03yeah
we also had a VHF LOW BAND DTV station too
the ION station I mentioned was originally on channel 4
03ours is 31
03anyway
seeya
04o-o

04herpderp
mSL is just easy to script in

04Ghetsis was a mean b!tch
04That goddamn Hydreigon
12i think he was kind to me
unfortunately I don't know how to script and can't find any complete tutorials

>:
4whats the point of getting the orbs from d/p/p if you dont catch the legendaries?
/me stretches
its because I don't like the "features" plus the creatures don't really interest me much either
4let me rephrase that
derp...
03you can i9mport the
03m
03and since when you import Pokémon they don't hold items
03that's why

I look at the vore-ish
why?
vore sucks :(
there's a reason why its called a fetish ):
vore is the 2nd most common fetish
I think bondage is the 1st most common

at least its not as bad as scat <.>
I liked scat for a little while then it died off

hoenn was actually decent
12Haters ganna hate XD
I hated Hoenn
4i agree
unlike sinnoh and isshu
03yeah
13Hoenn = best region
13IMO
03RSE were my favorite
4isshu?
I quit before the first gym
RSE were awesome
4derp
4nickstr
4why not say EWWWW EVERYTHING - 1st gen
4xd
4X
I like Johto and Shinoh though
4fingers are spazzing >_<
Isshu and Hoenn are about the only ones I hate
4what about kanto?
Kanto I like
13The only region I didn't like was Sinnoh
13Well, I didn't hate it
13But I found it the least enjoyable
^
4i dont hate any of them
sinnoh was meh imo
I hate Isshu because the games suck
4but i like 1st and 2nd best
hoenn is the best imo
cool
Blarg.
4why do we call it isshu?
none of them are bad
Hoenn because they were trying far to hard to be different
4^kosovo
4agreed
they weren't trying too hard
then i can have JasperBot up 24/7 again
10DANJO
4isshu tried really hard
4but i like most of its efforts
here's how I honestly see it:

!scramble
03it breaks the script
.
!endscram
Serebii because he is something of an egotistical jerk
x.x
o_O
03Sunain is also a jerkish godmod
that's not censorered?
-er
i guess not lopl
03it's a guy's name

03I'm the only one to have this
03well
/me flees
03to have this unwatermarked
03:)
lmfao
Sunain also says she is "just like Misty" as well
03it's in the TST's download section but it's crappishly watermarked
i don't care much
I can't see how
03because I fixed it for her XD
oic
oic
03Adobe Premiere is just the most retarded POS ever
it is
03which made it look stupid
03so I went and fixed it
03using virtualdub
03like a pro
03XD
03then she took my fixed one
03and watermarked it
03x.x
03I use Corel VideoStudio
Sunain is an isolationist and godmod
How can you hate Vegas xD;
12drf
i'ma guess he has something to do with Serebii
12what download section
12the site isn't up XD
03when it was
03I should finish this
03it's the Japanese PokéRAP with the English names
I have no clue how to work that script
03like, the segments from the American ones
12they should make another pokerap
12with the 600 something pokemn
03LOL
03there are 3
03but the Hoenn one sucks
03it was just an audio track
oh LOL, Pokémon music on SegaSonic Radio XD
yes i know it has that umlaut there i need to fix that
k
oh wait
she's always been that way
:p
along with keeping Ash's ego in check
it does
plus its just notoriously bad
03no it didn't
03what was pronounced wrong in the Johto Pokérap o.o;
10the names
10hang on
10let me play it
10Yanma
10They pronounced it Yawn-ma
10I pronounce it like Yaan-ma
10well
10the A sound
10sounds like yeah
10so yeahn-ma
03eh
03yeah I do too but that's trivial
!define cardiaplegia
03what else
-!- No results found
03one name is not "so many"
10seezor
10scizor
03I say it like "scissor"
lol
03in fact
03I have this picture here
03hold on
10quil-ava
03Quilava's sounded fine to me
10flaah-fee
10flaaffy
10I say flaa-fee
10xatu LOL
03http://i.imgur.com/jRu9O.png
03there
03pardon the quality
03this was years ago
13The PBR announcer is such a fail at pronunciation
03PBR fails in all regards
13even in the anime they pronounce it arca-nine
13he pronounces it are-canine
13:|
03well
03the example, Bonsly
13One of the many reasons I disabled the announcer's commentary |D
xD
03and they said it like "bons-lee"
03then in Battle Fronteir which was Pokémon USA
!ew 4Kids
13EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW 4KIDS
03they said it like "Bons-lie"
10I remember that @ drf
10They were aired around the same time too
03yep
13Oh yeah LOL
03well "aired", the movie was a DVD
03but regardless
03same
034KIDS may have butchered it, but IMO it's just not Pokémon without them
03but still, it'/s proof that 4KIDS can't say the names right XD
03Rayquaza was another one
03I say it like "ray-quah-zah"
03they said it like "ray-quay-za"
10Used to say with 'quah' too
10but I prefer 'quay'
03I don't
10Found one
10Growlithe
03o.o
o.o
10They said Growl-liiithe
10not Growl-ithe
/me 4is finally back
10But regardless
10Original Pokerap is awesome
03look at when they say Graveler
10Yeah
03Cartoon Network fixed it, oddly enough
03yeah they said Charmander weird
03putting emphasis on the "char"
10Obviously XD
03Pidgeotto was said odd but that's just to fit it in
03I've actually never noticed that before LOL
/me runs

03yeah
I swear, you manage to find everything XD
03Master Quest has two boxsets
4sparky...
I got that for $50
03Quest 1 and Quest 2
yeah?
03nickstr we're not talking about the PAL DVDs

03I know

03I SAID they're rare
03but they're all single layer

I gave up and imported
03then 9-12 legit
03yes I know it's DP but I'm collecting
03Pokémon Advanced boxsets are still being sold, but only at Amazon.ca
03not sure why, but eh
10Johto League Champions, does that have a boxset?
in Australia yes
because Magna Pacific wins like taht
*that
02my earsssss
02OOWWWW
02;__;
03so as far as American releases go, no
10k
03there's 7 total
/me writes this down
03which I finally have
03I just got the last two discs I was missing yesterday XD
03so I now own all 7
10Hm
03heck, I bought the 7th one back when it wasn't OOP
03as did mine
03yay DVD Decrypter?
10just of a few eps though
02Fine here :3
03Skylands I can send you DVD+R copies of like, the whole series LOL
02just with a cold but bleh...
02anyways, you?
03or at least the out of print ones
10Well
10Not copies
03same
03but it ends up being really pricey
10but if I ever become desperate, sure
10Meh
03heck, with Johto Journeys I would have taken copies
03but I couldn't even find those
03LOL
/me never sees Sammy no more ;-;
03that's how rare they are
03nickstr not all of us have region free DVD players
the PAL discs are far more common and cheaper
you do if you have VideoLAN
03they're also PAL telecined
03if I'm going to use a computer
03I'll just stick to the VOB files
plus DVD players convert between TV systems
03no they don't
03my DVD player exports whatever the DVD has
02.-.
03I've had region free PAL discs
03and it exported it in PAL>

its just a DSi with a bigger screen slapped on it

I never got a Dsi
02ohai NS
/me was stuck with a breaking DS lite for over 3 years
I never got a DSi because I did not see the need for it
I already had a PSP and that pretty much beats the DSi in multimedia

the DSi sucks in multimedia compared to the PSP

besides, I ask you (what) twice if I care?
*pokes* ??
And whether it really is good or not nearly everyone bought one.
Hey.
Power isn't everything anyway.
I am isolating hardware from games here
it really is
they both work at up to 1080p
02*sigh* I'm just way to lazy to read all this xD
the Wii can only do 480i at the most
plus its years behind in processing power
k
the Wii is a joke compared to the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360
Which is why the wii tops in sales?
Seems like it
By a massive margin?

xD
Yup :3
After they screwed the playstation series with the PS3
It's not that important.
the picture on the Playstation 3 looks sharper and more detailed
13thankiezs
the Wii looks fuzzy and pixelated in comparison
Makes no difference to me.
I already have glasses :3
its more than "a tiny amount"
That's subjective.
I have seen the two side by side before
the Wii can't come close
…
WHOA
that was WAY faster than usual
and I just got fixed with one picture
The wii have 84 million sales worldwide compared to only 50 million and 48 million Xbox, and PS3 sales.
has*
02nope.avi
I don't really like any of the companies that much.
yes you are
02I still would like a PS3 before the wii just by the fact of more games for online
02not for the graphics ¬¬
I use the PS3 over the wii just for the controller.
02xD
Hello ppl
02^
02how ever, I haven't play'd either both games at fully
02so my opinion doesn't count :3
*gamers
It's a family console.
A more social one.
wow trippy
the Wii is just gimmicks on top of gimmicks
i'm back
say my name when you come back
02lol PS3 reference
>>
where u gone
:P
02"the wiimote is a givemenick" time later here goes the PSMove
the only reason why those gimmicks have worked was Nintendo's marketing
PSMove is the crappiest thing I've ever seen.
which is everyone
02Agree with you @dari
I agree that portable systems just seem to be remakes of the same thing.
02true
they waited until 2001 to adopt CDs
02PS and XBOX otherwise the really DON'T Change...
02they are just remakes of the first thing...
xbox introduced a reliable internet-based gaming network
which is why a lot of people get it
02but the console was STILL the same
i'ma go poof
things to be doing
:/
ttfn
02yeah, that's the fun thing about "Inovation"
which is why the xbox was a success
where is that umm
which is why the PS1 was a success
which is why the Wii was a success

trollface.jpg
indexing them for AVI Synth
oh, yup
\
\
did you have anything else you wanned to say/ask me?
but I still have a concern about changing the framerate
fucking ladybugs
one just bit me
selecteven().tdecimate()
no for both, i think. i suggest my line, which brings it down to 24, analyzing for motion.
ok
I already indexed the AVC transport stream and brought it into AvSPMod along with doing color balancing and changing the brightness/saturation/contrast
3
I used tweak(sat=1.2,cont=1.12) #colours
coloryuv(gain_v=-5,gain_u=+10)
his apparently is already 5.1 surround
but i might change my mind, whats yours?
after I switch on the 1 TB external
(same for m2)
actually I did
it looks legit
most people don't have surround systems, also
Converttoyv12()
ColorYUV(gain_u=3, gain_v=-2)
Tweak(bright=-2, sat=1.5, cont=1.1)
hmm, the saturation is a bit high on yours
you may not need Converttoyv12()
unnecessary colourspace conversions may reduce quality
and its not needed
good thing we caught this now rather than later
only by like, 1%, minor
still an improvement as far as I am concerned
if only there was a native 64 bit version
there is avisynth64, i think. but there are like, baisiclly no native 64bit filters,
and don't expect any speed increases, either
oh, really?
yes
my M2 coefficients might look crap
the two seem to have similar tints
tweak(sat=1.12,cont=1.02) #colours m2coef
coloryuv(gain_v=+0,gain_u=-8) #m2coef may look crap
you have m2 ts on you?
yes
again stored on the terabyte external

03it was WB HD
03well
03it wasn't 720p
03he downscaled them
no, i'm ta;lomg about the japanese cap
03but the watermark actually said WB HD
03oh.,
03the WB ones were HDTV
03hence why I used them over Japanese TV
03here we are

ty
oh thanks for opening after a whole minute you piece of shit
nyek
okay hiddenhosts should now be synced x.x
wb
Have to enable remote connections
and whatnot
well
the thing is
when I direct port 5900 to it
it lets you in without a password
and I don't think x11VNC/whatever is even running
oh
it is running
wtf
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7503868/Screenshot-32.png - Hmm.
Then again I ssh more than I VNC.
I need to set up ssh on this lol
but I'm lazy
Speaking of.
repod@repod-desktop:~$ sudo gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Port 9876
repod@repod-desktop:~$ /etc/init.d/ssh reload
XD
Could not load host key: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
Could not load host key: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
\:D/
OpenBSD o_o
FreeBSD is nice
XD
/me connect to repod on 9876
well I use ssh for most servers
Yeah Griggs , I reset it to 21
put it on 34
:(
isn't 21 used for ftp or something
i forgot the port leave me alone
but 21 isn't forwardedededed anyway
21 is ftp
22 is ssh/sftp/random other shit
I was close.
and then universehosting makes me shit bricks every time I have to get into it
I have to -p 47185
/me runs IRC on port 9001
and I keep forgetting that
and it's like "RAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE"
heh
I have several servers on the one comp
I run servers on like, port 34, 9001, 6666 and more
used to have one running on 1337

anyway bbl
12what is he looking for a newspaper?
maybe
12not very many people would want to publish a book on the history of a kid's cartoon
12i should know when i tried to do a school report on dbz
12and wiki wasn't an allowed source
12well
12then again
12if he/she/they are that resistent to the truth
You can use the source Wikipedia cited

did you just learn that or something?
12not much you can really do
yes
12nah
the person insists on talking to Veronica Taylor
12okay sorry
I mean
I'm not offended anymore
I used to get offended by that XD
it's fine, seriously
12it's just that everytime i see HoR ever since i first saw it
>freedom of speech
12i thought of that word and kept to myself
Is that why you don't like us calling it HoR?
12that's why i always refer to this place as "that place"
12XD
12and yes
03LOL
12everytime i see it, my mind goes into the gutter
wat
12Veronica Taylor wouldn't tell the truth anyway

but she still shows up at NYAF

03the shame is that Maddie Blaustein was actually the most willing to work with forums and such, and she died

they can get lost and become no-life losers
nothing wrong with that
the shame is that Maddie Blaustein was actually the most willing to work with forums and such, and she died <- this
Rachael Lillis does work with fanclubs

We'd have to do it across the network xD
No, we need to name ChanServ "SkyNet."
please!
That is the best idea ever!
:P

Or that!
You don't screw with SkyNet.
Arnolds start popping up everywhere when that happens.
Blargness owns Skynet

Awkward
/me chalks one up.

I still say we should rename Chanserv for a month lol

People always find something to whine about
about ChanServ being renamed
not like anyone really talks around here lol

He ate that one.
You're all going to help me find one by e-mailing me a full list of everyone you know between the ages of somewhere around my age
Yes
Oh, wait, no, she broke up with me
YOU ATE HER?!
D:
Oh
/me points to her parents
THEN you ate her, right?
You just had to consume her flesh.
Oh, no, it was a mutual break up
She just proposed the motion
I seconded it
Her parents influenced her?
The board chair asked for any objection, and seeing no objection, he ruled that the motion carries
She wasn't really the right person for me
And she liked me but her parents didn't want her dating anyone
DUDE
that was crazy
O.O
o_____o
Soooooooo
/me is glad she's not outside
WE know.
She's a cute too :3
But
She doesn't appear to be very delicious.
Yeah
I feel like being blunt
I'm drinking tonight

Painful.
Why would anyone think the whole world wants to hear that?
Reckless intercourse is in vogue.

They actually said lolzrawr?
No, another exagguration :(
Oh, just a little embellishment.

Not really. It's older than that.

Wait, he's a Ballchinian.
Yeah, not for eating though

I don't think I'm gonna find anyone down here though xD
/me is too different :3
still thinking of moving to Canadaland?
/me nods
I think you should have two separate partners. One for the gradual consumption, and one for actual dating.
/me is really interested in Canabananada
I hate you
Good man.
/me 's eyes grow wide and he waits expectantly.
not at the moment why?
Just curious.... I like keeping track of these things
I'd like to but I can't really do that at this point and time
Because I think she likes you
I know she does
You and Glace broke up then?

/me googles

Oh
She was a JW?

03isn't there a furigana too?
in katakana would be "ナシ"
furigana is the tiny letters written on the sides/top of kanji (depending on the orientation)
okurigana is the hiragana/katakana that comes after the kanji
03LOL THAT CHARACTER
03it looks like a fricking face
…

I NEVER noticed that
03I keep referring to that as the "Japanese smiley face"

03I mean the actual naming scheme
03both are based on UNIX.
oh
03hence why the terminal is the same
03well, the commands rather
orer, POSIX
not if you consider the kernel but I am splitting hairs
03o.o
mach-O , iirc
I am not totally sure about the exact name but I do know its Mach

03"Supercard 3DS"
03Um, no?
03there's no such thin
03g
there are also some illegal folder names, such as prn and com1
interesting that HFS would block those things
just a few more to add to my gripes about windoze, youknow?
man I HATE the Android 2.2 low battery alert
its way too loud and scares the crap out of me every time
oh yea
03weird

03I sent FMA a router and he bricked it
and I thought he was a tech person
03he is
how did that happen
03no idea
how did you debrick it
03I didn't
03he still has it
let me guess
DD-WRT firmware
03yeah
03I wanted him to make it run faster for me
03as even using stock firmware it was going hellishly slow
just like my WRT54G v8
03this was a WRT150N
03the one HE recommended to me
04o-o
risk or brock.
04;:|
*of brick
04:|
I hacked mine
plus the features are incredible
wut features?
lik,e hosting ur own servar?
03virtual access points for one
03you can have as many as you want on one router
04some weird tech talk
/me listens
04or reads
04w/e
03LOL
I can't list everything in DD-WRT
yes
if you are a business using a router with the firmware
the bandwidth monitoring features might be useful for you Jun
i just login to my ISP's page
ok
DD-WRT lets you do that from the router firmware
i herd SVG was gettin ditched or something
I have no idea
but most browsers should have it
you can also do things like increase the transmit power for WIFI
I boosted it a little bit
in fact given this I recommend the WRT54G
for a couple reasons
1. they are cheap plus 802.11g is fine for most people
the WRT54GL I also recommend
/me pokes
have you read Reminiscence?
/me tackles
04I read some of it
go read the rest then
I spent 6 months writing it >:B
lol WRT54
WRTs are decent
sometimes
i have a wired modem from D_LINK
the official VXWorks firmware is crap though
the two I mentioned are pretty much identical except for one thing
as does the WRT54G up to version 5
o_o
wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
12what?
XD
Dlink lol
vxworks RTOS, ae?
they're okay
12interesting
it sucks to say the least
12the only reason to get an apple device is for the autocorrect
speedstream routers
12it's a natural comedian
mfw
in fact I am starting to see VXWorks as an oxymoron now
and ATT routers
12pff
also kinda afk going to be like
configuring bind9
and failing
some of the mistakes I have seen one make are HILARIOUS
one of the best was mistaking "his track meet" for "histerectomy"
owel --> Peel (that wan i encountered myself)

k
03well that's odd
03but yet, the DSTWO specific one that utilizes moar CPU doesn't do sound o.o;;;
oh, there's also a kernel panic, and iirc, a BSOD screensaver for mac, too
nice
wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

03to 5th gen
03anyway
04and I'm like
04LOWER LEVEL
03Chimera, same here
03it's all about type advantages ZXD
03-Z
04actually
04regardless of types |D
03my Haunter does that same thing
03but
03it has low defense
o_o
03so I just gotta out-speed themXD
10o.o
04Yeah :P
heya
10hi
04Mine aren't the speediest
04But dang Serperior is freaking fast
04He's suppose to be
03exactly LOL
04Arcanine's not a starter though :3
mine is the real deal too
03I know
04but
04he's still cool
04Stone evos are usually boss
04:E
03I'll get a team of 3 starters
03Chikorita, Charmander, and um
Hm
03that isn't 5th
10Shiny's on TST's server
04:P
hes on here too
not joined to any channels
03I said STARTER
04starter
03wait no I didn't
03I mean starter
i was about to say that xD
10lolwhy
04forgot to add that
second
04It depends
Totodile
04lol
03hm
03I kinda like Blastoise myself but eh
04Alligators ftw yeah
Feraligatr is pretty cool though
04drf
04are you looking for stats or appearence
04:P
03which one is stronger?
03stats LOL
04k
03I mean
04lemme check
03as fire/flying is pro
03and I just have an attachment to Chikorita XD
03and Bayleef/Meganium whatever
10http://th03.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2011/079/c/b/a_winner_is_n_by_mudonite-d3c3enu.png
03Meganium can learn Leaf Blade, can'tit?
04I think
03k
04But um
03though I dunno
03is Sceptile stronger than Meganium?
04lol 82
04lemme check
03well
04but its defense is
04100
03I don't see why that matters
04um
04Leaf Blade?
03k
03nvm
0485
04for Sceptile
0484 XD
03o_o
03what's Sceptile's defense?
04erm no, 83 I think
0465
03ew
03so it's stronger but weaker
03I like tanking grass types LOL
03just because they seem to be the weakest type
04120 speed
03what's Meganium's speedd?
03-d
04LOL Sceptile's actually faster than serperior
04um
04slow
04very
04slow
0480
03so you'd suggest going with Treecko over Chikorita?
04Hm
04It kinda depends
03well
04I mean, its faster
03so yeah
04So if you can tank its attacks with ones that'll knock out virtually anything that can kill it
04you'll be good
04with Sceptile that is
03heh
03well'
03I <3 Chikorita, but at the same time, Sceptile is really awesome
03it's hard to decide :/
04I mean
04its stats

04x-x
04yes, the turning point of battles
04lol

well, youre only proving my theory even more right
other than that...I have been fantastic :D

Sat 19th Feb '11 - Silver's Saturday Show: 48
no one has ever had it below 60 before
And if you quit, you'll be the first person to get 0 :(
well, i keep asking myself every saturday, "is this really worth it if no one really honestly cares"
And I can't be there at that time to bring activity
hmmm
well, everyone seems to be busy that day :(
which is right after my show
hey, does this sound right to you: 4-7 minutes of 4 player Co-op gameplay (L4D2)=roughly 4MB of data transmitted?
Seems fair
hmm, that's not that bad then...
If you could get that down to 1-2 MB-ish, dialup players could play.
(Not joking)
I suppose.

Hi
Animal Crossing 3DS preview much x.x
(:
lol...
I am just assuming
I could check next time I play L4D2
Please do :D
Right now
oh, I am not worried about speed. I just want to know how much data is burned through during a session
/me is doing english homework involving it
Assuming average speed is the same for you, we know how much usage per hour you have
I can read Shakespearean but hells to know if we know if he dies
if we never heard the story before
/me is now away: gone (22:52:57)
04nickstr, it's that one part
04besides
prolly is not, but if I run at les speed than you(likely,as I am using a 3G network for my connection), then I prolly am burning through less data
04it's kinda not really meaningful anyway
3mbir wireless here

it is
but cannot trade
04Why not?
I don't own to DS systems

I would have to have someone hold them for me when I switch cartridges
04I only have two because my sister doesn't use hers anymore lol
alright, 106ms ping time, 996 kbps download, 419 kbps upload. Not the best, but it is playable

Hi
today i tried Motion instead of after effects for a bit
How was it?
its based on a different ideology
Heh
K
Also junh
You think you have any idea how I can fix my problem?
Hm
which is good if you're a noob and want something to move,
EW PIDGIN
Maybe it's because I installed it onto my I:/ drive...
I'll check into that tomorrow
you can do keyframes in motion tho
Warning: Some content may be found unsuitable for some users. Discretion advised.
its just not "preffered", i think?
o_O
Heh
woah
Interesting
but one consequence, is
I preffer keyframing because it's easier to me

IT'S ALIVE
say you wanted to have an object continuisly rotate.
Keyframes
Are kinda naturally workable for me
omaigawd
You can move keyframes ;3
or else, you can use expressions, if you're comfortable with maths/programming
ooooh that reminds me
yea, you can also move start & end points of behaviours
K
beeen using a a bit of expressions lately, kinda handy.
probably.
i've put like, 30hours into one project in AFX. i probably don't want to switch.

particles on text
err, particles of text

one thing that i've been wanting to do for a while is to "rain text" of specific letters, say a phrase.

you may be able to change codec independent of container using some tools, and vice-versa,

Starmie is incredible
I have been battling with them for years
12what
12we aren't friends?
12pff
03XD
12lol
03http://sale.images.woot.com/New_Level___p1qDetail.png <- OMG @ this shirt
03I should totally buy that
oh thats right
12o-o
STARMIE, USE THUNDERBOLT!
03you know
03this music always makes me sad
03when I listen to it
03but yet I can't help it
03x.x
03well it's just a really pretty tune
03that's addicting
sort of like ABBA's When All Is Said And Done
addictive but sad
03I'm making a thead on TST forums about DVD collecting
03this *is* about Pokémon
ok
12o-O
12massive updates
night all
03http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6870.0
03I think that's pretty accurate XD
12night kos
12what's there to figure out about collecting DVDS
12the end
03LOL
03because some of them have more than one release and others are confusing and/or hard to find
finding rare or import ones might be good information to add
03what's there to figure out about Pokémon cards, you just buy them
12drfsupercenter
12what are those type dvds i see out there now
03The majority of people don't own region-free DVD players and it just makes things more confusing
Master Quest, Johto Journeys, and Johto League Champions
ANY NTSC region 1 discs that is
03yeah
03oh
ANY NTSC region 1 Johto Journeys, Johto League Champions, or Master Quest discs are rare
03which are stupid
03they're just the normal episodes but rearranged
03though I think I'll add it to the thread
03Umbreon, raking in more money
03I bought them just because I collect them
03but they're dumb
12how many episodes are in each element one? XD
or calling Viz out for their licensing idiocy
033
or there release idiocy
03so it's really a waste of money
03No idea
03the only use for them
03and this is why I got the
03m
12narrows it down to every episode ever made
12XD
03since those had like 12 episodes a disc
03rather than 3
but they frick rare
03that's really the only use I see in those and most people aren't quality wh0res like me
and frick expensive
03Orange isn't rare
03I have both
03but my first set is pretty scratched up :/
12and it was the very last episode in the set
12XD
12lucky me
I am just annoyed with Viz
Magna Pacific FTW!
03eh
03Magna Pacific released movie 8
03honestly I don't like them much
03and I mean
03movie 8 was only like 3GB
03and bad quality
03why not fill the stupid disc up
03I know
03the only way to get it in widescreen
and they are all easy to find!
03so did Viz, they just stopped making them
because they are idiots
03if you were to buy them several years ago you woulda been fine LOL
03I know
03I hate VIZ too but I'd rather have NTSC
03since it's native NTS
03*C
trollface.jpg
03Woah
03Contains Episodes 206, 327, & 727

well here is the post
03Umbreon I have but I have no idea how to eve find that program
12o-O
12google?
12or is that too nooby?
ok, finally to take a break from the frightening tablet
03the problem is
03as in 1000 billion
03so yeah
i suggest pidgin: its free
http://www.trillian.im/
03EW GAY-M
found it
12i never had problems
03well I know Helios uses Trillian
03and likes it
03so eh
might as well suggest trying Boolean searches as well
i use pidgin & liek
12oh
12pidgin doesn't appeal to me for some reason
the Trillian Android client does not look too bad
I might have to try it
/me can also recommend Trillian.
03WOAH
03the audio is completely f***ed up
03apparently it doesn't like LPCM.
2.2 is supported
plus the slogan is amusing
03hm
03so far only one file plays LOL
yes I would certainly like more power for R2D2
or C3PO
I am just going to charge the battery now
03hm
03seems the DSTWO only truly works with XVID
03newer codecs tend to get screwed up
oops
redundancy
03it can play WMV, but it skips a lot
03etc
still a bit on edge
I guess that has a coprocessor
its the only way since the DS does not have much processing power
03yes
03the DSTWO has a 400MHz ARM processor on the card
impressive
03*player
03whereas usually you have to use Moonshell on specially-encoded files
ANDROID ANYONE
/me runs
03LOL
03hm
that would be cool
DSTWO running Android
03that one works
03but then again look at the resolution LOL
that could be why
03yep most likely
lower resolution means of course lower processing power required

10"So let me get this straight: If you have both versions and two accessible DSes, are you in good shape as far as regaining lost trainers go?"
03yeah
nah
03I had said, if you don't mind wasting a lot of time and effort, sure
Not everyone regs as soon as they join
03either one or the other
connect, rather
yeah
they get the message to reg don't they
and there's also guests
no
filters out idiots

7A'ight.
7Just looking for one to fill my pokedex.
Just send Dr. Hax after them XD
hah
getting botnets like at least once every day
the only problem with this is how annoying it is
which part, how often the botnets are happening, or Dr. Hax's catchphrase XD
I'll get my men working on it.
/me disappear in smoke.
XD
06ah, skiddies

03LUCKY EGG.
Why do you say that? XD
I'd have to agree.
what's with the sudden my little pony fetish lol
it's a thing going around
the show got a fanbase on 4chan and now everyone's watching it
wow
that's just creepy
oh the joys of being an IRCop
trolls one day, botnets the next
I've seen the show; it's not bad
0.o
The My Little Pony show isn't bad?
wow never thought I'd hear you say that
It's different than the show from the 80s (apparently)
still lol
06But yeah.
03:3
/me makes a gagging noise
because they'll have to watch it with their kids
rigghhhhht
What's that?
:P
it's a podcast lol
LOL Did you know that "Dammit I'm Mad" spelled backwards is "Dammit I'm Mad."?
06Spaces doesn't agree with you
:p
sorry but this is just too gay for me lol: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/MyLittlePony-RunawayRainbow.jpg/220px-MyLittlePony-RunawayRainbow.jpg
It's a "reboot" of the series
04o-o
04QUAN
XD
04What is the sprite size limit in B/W?
04Is it still 80x80?
ohh you must mean this
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_is_Magic
bah, my computer's going crazy... brb
yeah, that's it
wow
sorry but even that is too gay for me
I'm not expecting you to like it XD
7O.o
/me 7checks.
arg
http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic
just no
04ok...thanks
blah
03the sprites in BW suck
03they look a lot worse than HGSS
7Eh, they're not bad.
04phew
03right, they aren't bad, they're AWFUL
0495x64
03pixeled as f***
he's not
Lol
04Just within
7You mean when animated, DRF?
wb AE :3 ^_^
03I mean both
03especially the rear-facing ones
03as in
03your Pokémon
03it's fricking pixelated
04it's only when they're animated.
03it looks a lot worse than HGSS
03but the sprites are ALWAYS animated
:P
04I don't mind that
03it looks horrible
You can interrogate him about it when next time he's online if you want :P
7We have opinions. Deal with them. :P
lol
nah
that would be creepy
if he wanted to roleplay as a pony
I'm not that dickish
o_O
03pretty much everyone I know who's played BW has agreed the sprites look a lot worse than DPP/HGSS
/me cross it off the list
06Good night
06nini
7Everyone?
list of words I haven't used before lol
03yep
04gnight
Unless you ARE one and you've been lying this whole time
DUN DUN DUN!
03besides the music it's really the only thing I like.
04The music is incredible
of the OST
03same here, but when it comes to Pokémon, the Pokémon themselves are a pretty crucial part
13Of course, beautiful graphics are nice to have too
it is in more ways than one
03exactly
03and in order to really enjoy it you need to either speedrun or hack
03or both
04^
04I enjoyed the graphics.
/me flees
03yeah
03third gen has the best of a lot of things
03and the reason why? They didn't try to make it too complicated
03as in
7Speaking of complexity, Triple/Rotation battles.
04lolololol
03most retarded thing ever
13I'm terrible at triple/rotation battles
04Triple battles was a stretch, but Rotation?
13|D
03yeah
03Double battles were already bad enough
13They're too damn difficult for me :<
03*WB02(Aeroslash02)03WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
04Really, it's too complex.
7Double was okay.
03that's a GOOD thing
03if it was any more I'd rage
03Quanyails, that's correct
03there's only one
04Same Quan
7Mmm'kay.
7You're usually warned beforehand.
03yeah
7Ah, random probability.
7The priority?
lol
03what the frick is Carracosta
03my Staryu is plenty fast
03that's why you don't use 5th gen.
03:P
04I prefer to only use 5th Gen
04Dunno why
13It ALWAYS activates for them
03that's just stupid though
04lol AE
I thought you liked Cynder
03pretty much any 5th gen can be pwned by a 1-4 gen
03heck
I did
7Not necessarily.
I still do in limited doses
when it's not abused
as it has been
I remember a day when that was considered the RARE pairing to write about
hard to believe
7Hold items?
yeah I know
7I have passive, non-battle-boosting ones.
the LoS fandom seems to be dying down though
I haven't seen a Cynder fantard in a while
03EW THAT FACE
7Still managed.
eh they'll come and go
03yeah I used those twoo
03-o
03but that doesn't actually help you :P
7Exactly.
03Exp share just helps with leveling
04?
04Huh
Yeah
03but seriously
03when I beat the Elite Four, I had less than 10 Pokémon.
especially now with this Skylanders crap
03because all I did was trade 6 relatively good first-gens and pwned everyone with them.
7Caught?
Have you been playing Mass effect
03and it wasn't even level-abuse, they were normal levels.
03Yeah
03they were from HeartGold.
03well
7I catch everything. :P
03"forced trading"
03as do I
03but
03if it's 5th gen, I don't catch it.
04yes
7Lol.
7Ah, such a bias.
03it's because they're fricking stupid
7Your opinion.
04^
03the opinion of about 90% of Poké;mon fans.
04Me to
7[citation needed]
03it's just you
7@ DRF.
04The opponent ALWAYS uses crits, but I never get them.
13Because in nearly every battle I have, the opponent lands a critical hit on me
13:<
12Opinion! = Fact
03NightSeas, it's a fact that lots of people have an opinion.
7I have a Unfezant I've oriented especially toward crits.
13Trainer battles are even worse, I've had 4 critical hits in a row happen to me before >:/
04ouch
7She crits about 50% of the time.
03well it also depends on the move
03I just rely on type advantages
03ultimately, just get a team of 6 different types
03and you sould be set against about 95% of enemies.
04It's not that I want them
04It's that they always land on me
03LOL
13They always happen to land the critical hits right when I don't want them too
7I've based my team off of types as well.
the Forces of Chais
04I have a single tank
*Chaos
04Carracosta
13and the damn thing 1-hit-KOs me with a move that is "not very effective"
03I have Vileplume and Arcanone
03*Arcanine
04Half my team are sweepers
04I dunno
04It depends
04The Council would ignore them
03the only thing I lack is ground
03well, and ice
04And most good guys would try and open negotiations but get cut down
And how would they react in Warcraft?
yep
looking forward to it already
03yeah
03electric.
7Lol.
03I was forgetting my 5th
03*6th
Right
04Or a fighting
03and really
I am being sarcastic of course lol
04Something to balance it out
7Against Psychic types.
13Bug types and fighting types all over the place in B/W
04um
I'll totally pay $75 for anything that has Spyro in it, even if it's crap
Oh, I know lol
03er
03right
7o.o
03I had that the other way around
04Espy, I don't like any of them XD
03ghost is strong against psychic
7You mean weak?
04yeah
yep
03both strong and weak.
already looking forward to it
03Strong if you're using it
03weak if you get hit
03:P
03so yeah there you go
7Yes.
03what's the point of dark?>
"old"
7Because the damage is not amplified on both ends.
04Dark was to balance out the overpowered Psychic in Gen 2
03heh
03well
03that's my only problem with Haunter/Gengar.
13In a way, normal-types are just as bad |D
13Not super-effective against anything, and plenty of types resist it
03well yeah
03normal is kinda stupid
03unless you're like
03Chansey
03that thing is awesome
04It has a wide range of moves
03fricking tanks
04And only one weakness
7:P
04^
04I never got that
13I still dunno how it happened |D
03and get this
04It's like a stalemate
03:P
03and I have proof to back it up
I agree with you drf
03I know you do
how dare you forget to mention me
>:(
04Um
04LOL
xD
03but whatever
XD
7Hmm.
I try to be as open-minded as possible
04Gen 5 has the extreme of both good and bad.
13and I don't really care about any of the others
^
03I have yet to see any that I actually lik,e
o_o
03they're either ripoffs of other Pokémon, or ripoffs of objects, or just plain stupid
04I mean
04Hydreigon
03Dragonite. Fix'd.
04I've been waiting since Gen 2 for a Dark/Dragon type.
7Ripoffs, right.
03like what's that cat thing
03it's just a ripoff of Skitty
04Leipard and Purrloin
03it looks exactly like Skitty mixed with its evolved form.
7They're called expies, DRF.
03ex pies?
03they used to be pies?
03nice to knlw
03I'm gonna go eat one
7No, you fish. :P
<Drake> I've been waiting since Gen 2 for a Dark/Dragon type.
04OOOOH
03no
well Sanzador or w/e it was called
03that move sucks
sucks
7Yes.
fly sucks
03Dude
03fly is the best thing ever
7Rattata = Sentret = Zigzagoon = Bidoof = Patrat
7Lol, DRF.
fly MISSES
oh lol stall
03no see
03yeah
I can't stand stalling
03poison them
03then use fly
03wtf is tailwind
03ew
7It does 33.25 damage average a turn.
03delete tailwind
7@ Fly.
03er
03what
03it does 90
03and it takes two turns
03that's 45
03yeah
03apparently
03either that or Fearow hx
/me runs
03*hax
04I thought it was always 90...
03me too
13^
03and I hate move slike that
04...no
7Lowers stats?
03oh
03then that
03I was thinking CLose Combat, my bad
7Waaaait:
04lol NS
03but yeah
03I hate both moves
close combat is actually good
7It's been 90 since Gen. 4? O__o
03they annoy me
03Yep.
04Hey
/me 7LOLs.
03Fly and Surf are like the most pro things ever
surf is good
03yeah
7I've got the Gen. 3 stats in my mind.
03lik even in battle
03it's fricking epic
7Surf is good.
hydro pump can die in a tsunami or something
7Fly is meh.
03well
03I'm like
03who cares if it takes two turns
03they can't hit you
03when you're in the air
03so it really doesn't matter
7Thunder?
they can with twister
03but as I was saying
twiiiister
twister...twitter
03the battle animations in BW give me a massive headache
mind blown
03because of how it keeps zooming in on the Pokémon
03it's like AHHHHHH MY EYES
7I like them, lol.
03well
7O.o
03I hate the camera effects.
wat
