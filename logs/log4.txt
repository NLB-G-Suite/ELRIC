What is the script for sky
http://basicinstructions.squarespace.com/storage/2010-04-21-explain.gif
postage to US for 500 grams costs $18 nzd, and weight is unknown
10none
:D
10Flareon is fire + floof
10= firefloof
:o)
and postage by weight scales linearlly-ish
so i'd say, you can pay me like, $~70usd for both incl. shipping ish
10Hi Bree
a bubblewrap bag and a box costs about the same, which is $2nzd, which one do you want?
Breeee <3
03gtffhtftg
03o.o
floof
lols
lulz
Soo, I might take off the bridge soon
10London bridge?
<HML> No this bridge
It's falling down.
Wut
<HML> Since I can't have mIRC on all the time on my laptop
...What is this I don't even
<HML> drf.lugia.us lol?
<HML> His new server for TST since nest was sadly taken down
I... see
ohai n2 \o
<HML> Which made ocean screwy >.>
Seems so.
Ocean cries for the loss of its comrade.
And is now slowly commiting suicide.
<HML> Ocean dies of the loss of its comrade
Apparently so
|D
<HML> And due to the scripting, my speach won't go through
<HML> Since Remotes can't be used by the person holding it lol
I see your speach.
Wait
So ocean is messed up now?
Wth
<HML> YEah
<HML> Like badlyt
<HML> *Badly
<HML> Died every few mins a hour ago
Why
...
Because Nest is gone
<HML> Been safe for over >30mins
<HML> Not exactly
<HML> But the host for the server was acting up
I make theories. None are ever right. So there.
its been working fine since nest was disconnected
<HML> No resolvves for the IP
All this is new
What is the script for sky
<%Skylands> 10none
Damn
XD
<HML> Ever since nest :|
So yeah
...
Nest went down almost 48 hours ago
This problem started just a few hours ago
Since it was fine even this morning
<HML> Yeah, nest wasn't the issue per se
<HML> But the lack of it made this worse
<HML> Since there is only one server to have over 25people'
Well, that's something people have to deal with, I agree with arti for taking it down
03wtf
03my Xbox won't let me transfer a *demo*
03weird
yeah I dunno
03well right now I'm offline while transferring stuff so I can't talk to LL

Dhdhheha
7Rora?
Hmm
.....no?
I've been gone all day
7Ah, well...
02Time to go
...
Let me get on the computer I guess
[QUIT] HML has quit the server on drf.lugia.us
yay, I just unlocked 4-bit Meat Boy!
and finally got that last damn bandage in world 2
WOW
Okay, that failed
Asked who about what and when
7Well, the moderators, I suppose--here, I'll get the exact line (It's not yet approved).
Wait
I'm connecting from my computer
7Eh?
Its hard to do this from my phone
7Okay.
/me 7waits, then.
03*WB02(Aurora02)03WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
7'kay.
ok what now?
6I didn't realize the gallery requires a separate ban >.>
/me 6does that
7o.o
7Okay.
>x.x,
6first of all
6explain the whole story to me
7http://mibpaste.com/wEBRi0
7Well, that failed.
6lol yeah
6don't worry, I'll read it
7Thanks. :P
6please don't tell me that's a script
6that's going to go off everytime you join
6.....
6wth?
03Aurora
03that script shows the activitiy on the other server
03because ocean has been having massive issues
03so if people can't connect here they can connect there
03and since it's not actually linked here yet that script shows what's going on on each
6the timing of ocean's problems is weird
03I know right
6plus, I haven't seen it go down once
03well my server is up and running but it's not linked here
03it's gone down like 10 times today
03btw Aurora
03you'll never believe what I bought today
Preordered xD
6BW
03that totally gave it away >_>
03yeah
03both games
6not surprised
6cuz you already told us
03I said I might
03XD
6you intended to
6ah
6well
6anyways
03when I heard about video chatting
03I was like
03do want
03portable webcams ftw
6@quan, I'm mixed feelings about letting her on there
7Oh, yeah--remember, Celebi event comin' up.
6*having
I am still a bit mixed on Black and White
7Aye, but that's what we came to you for.
03yeah, I was too, I decided to just buy the stupid thing
6I know
03I got both because I collect the games
6I'll handle it once again
03as for the stupid 5th generation Pok√©mon I'm gonna just ignore them LOL
I don't collect them
03until I can get real ones
03well I have every GBA/DS Pok√©mon title to date
03well
03not counting the Trading Card Game for GBC as that was stupid.
what about Gameboy and Gameboy Color?
you still have some work to do
Get a GAB
6TCG game for GB color
*GBA
6was actually fun
6for a while
6but still
you can pick up the older ones at thrift stores
but might have issues with dead button cells
Yeah
for R/B/Y its a CR1616 which can be replaced with a CR2025 and for G/S/C its a CR2025 which can be replaced with a CR2032
6sigh
6and here's where the freaking galleries fail
6there's no message system
o.o
6so i can't alert her
Oh
6unless I make a random post on something
Don't you have her email?
I replaced the button cell in a copy of Pokemon Gold which now works perfectly
Well, if she even has it
6yeah but I don't think I ever got an lugia.us email
6I am NOT sending from my normal email
I need to do crystal, since it keeps giving me a corrupted file
6last thing I need is her having it
LOL I know XD
6ok, apparently there's a glitch in crystal version
6I want to test it
you need as I said a CR2025 or a CR2032
Really?
6a lot of people have tried it and either it's a huge coincidence
6or an actual legit glitch
6probably the most frustrating one at that
And a special scredriver and soldering kit
6something that seriously increases the chances of finding shiny pokemon
What happens in it Rora?
they are both 3 volt lithium button cells but the CR2032 is slightly thicker
LOL
6before you get pokeballs
6apparently lasts longer
Yeah XD
Silly button cells, brought 4 for my SNES carts
6but yeah, successfully replaced mine
6so lovely
Lucky ;(
its an exact replacement
7*random fangirlish moment*
7I haven't had one of those in a while. O_o
so you had the right idea
So is a topic change randomly needed?
6hmm
7Eh, that's just me.
6I think I can lift her ban, but still prevent her from posting
7I've gotta sleep soon, so don't expect me.
6that will give me enough time t send the PM
7A mute?
/me idles
A mute on a forum, madness
What a shock, DRF idling for once
7Gotta go.
7Hope this gets settled.

God damnit Kingdom hearts reference
lol where?
holy sheet at that video
I know
some TV and FM transmit towers in the midwestern US really are that tall
I have seen one that is 1,676 feet tall
12?
but its all done in the name of coverage
with VHF and UHF the higher the better because you have a clearer line of site
TheUnversed
I got sweaty cold feet and palms just by watching this
Kingdom Hearts BBS enemies
I know
but that job had to be done
ahh
xD
lololol
while me doing a kingdom hearts fanfic
oh joy
tower lighting is required by both the FCC and the FAA for towers that tall
basically its to keep airplanes, helicopters, and other flying vehicles from hitting the tower at night
and in other times of poor visability
D;
Can't they use like, hot air balloons or something?
yay i'm out of the hospital ^-^
Or maybe give these people parachutes so if they fall, the parachute can break it?
i got out around lunchtime today
it might be a good idea
i also herd that bees are dying because of cellphone towers &
anyway rbr
honey will be more expensive

You can't resist him
ok, I could resist him in every way other than body-shattering violence
and fire
and acid

See?
Seeeeeeeeee?
ok, I could resist him in any way that doesn't involve harming him
is that specific enough?

Couldn't be more awesome than my dream.
did you check?
where I live is remarkably free of poisonous creatures, thankfully
nuhuh
england is like the anti-australia
everything in australia is out to kill you
04Mine was where I was this psychic kid trapped on a floating fortress by this psychic master and I had to escape with the help of other psychic kids. Then we ran across a country from the master because he was hunting us, and one by one we died.
i misplaced a box of live bark scorpions that was for my aunt :3
why were you keeping scorpions in a box?
04Then I was the last one left.
04Then the dream ended.
because they won't stay in a shoe =3
/me wants to go to sleep
erm
his*
04Now I have the urge to write a story about it.
04Because it's AWESOME
maybe i should've gotten emperor scorpions =3
but why keep scorpions at all?
as pets?
they make great pets
my neighbor has 3 emperor scorpions named larry moe and curly
noooooo
/me clings to Curly and she is not a scorpion

Somewhat, online from work currently ;p
03LOL
Sorting through some files
First off, who wants the server info pasted to them?
03me ideally
o_O?
yeah we kinda need the cloak-keys
and oper blocks...and link block crap...and such...
brb again...
/me randomly LOL's at a pea
k LL
o_O
03http://www.lugia.us/Peas/?643
XD
03I dunno why but I literally started cracking up
I'll check the operblocks, but if there are any cleartext passwords in them, I can't include those blocks until /mkpassword <type> <text> has been done, and the type/hash is provided to me
either that I'll go hash them myself and replace the passwords
03uh'
03I think Arti was fine with you just giving me ssh access though, which might be easier
03unless
03you want access to mine?
yeah
uh hang on drf
03k
just /mkpasswd md5 them
unless you use sha1 or something
I'll need explicit confirmation before I can do that ;p
I use md5 so yeah
@ ssh
03go email her or something LOL
http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6722.msg256650#new
it's not me that wants ssh access ;p
XD
03yeah that's what I was interpreting as it was OK
03but I duno
03*dunno
what is the name of the server that will be linked?
tst.lugia.us
but uh, I need to restart it to change the servername
03-ocean.lugia.us- *** Notice -- Connection to nest.lugia.us[nest.lugia.us] activated.
03-
03-ocean.lugia.us- *** LocOps -- ERROR :from nest.lugia.us -- Link denied (No matching link configuration) [@72.20.16.202.60939]

03-
03why do I keep getting that
oh yeah
03Arti said it's nothing on her end o.o
oh wait
I juped it, should sort those errors, will configure the blocks soon
03OK
yeah
cloak-keys
03I have them
03he PM'ed them to me
mibbit info
03and the webirc thing
yeah
/me checks what else
I've pasted that stuff already ;p
I think that's all really
03yeah I got it
oh
modules
03she's just helping me is all
sanitizing the oper blocks now
'sanitizing'
03can you give all the ircops op-override?
03because when services go down that's kinda needed
to*
or maybe give drf services root
and yeah, mabye something a little more creative than tst.lugia.us ;p
03can't that be changed later?
it can, but it means having to go change linkblocks again
back...
03hm
03you know
03can we just call it island.lugia.us?
03That one's really grown on me
03it sounds cool XD
sure
fits in with ocean, I'd say ;p
03yeah
get Arti to add the DNS
03let's do that
03I'll reply on the forum thread
you guys figure out the link block passwords
whats the IP of the new server?
is the IP static?
03yes it is
64.32.1.34
0364.32.1.34
03yeah
lmfao
generating linkblock now
alright
Liiiiiiiiiink...
also drf, do a nslookup on the IP from your command prompt
made me lol
Are the servers going to be linked with SSL? And which port is going to be used for the server links?
03LOL
sure
03SSL yes, 6697
well
we'll make it +7000
03same ports as yours basically
for serversonly
if that's okay with drf
Thats what I was meaning @ asc ;p
yeah
6697 is client only
03OK
03yeah I don't care
03whatever works LOL
k well then
let me fix everything up
do you want me to set autoconnect?
checking to be sure ocean accepts serveronly 7000 too
03yeah @ autoconnect
Current ports ocean accepts, FYI:
:10:59:45: -ocean.lugia.us- *** Listener on 72.20.16.202:8080, clients 1. is PERM

ignore the server name
We're not allowed to open port 8080 on this thing or it'll get killed >>
90 second server ping frequency, if wanting to keep those synched
open proxy etc.
160sec user ping freq
oh
I left that stuff as default like I usually do
but hang on
it's a little more forgiving of timeouts and user disconnections
at the expense of longer time to pingout
and reduces netsplits a little
ah
I just set it on 160
so, link block stuff?
is it windows or unix?
unix
some sort of bsd I believe
/me checks
yep
FreebSD
As for oper blocks, let me know which flags you need included in your ocean operblock
cleaning it up a little
Uh...
I'm not an oper lol
03<JoshtheRipper> Brad do you have any issues with " burn in " on your plasma?

03<KnaveBrad> I have it bolted to the wall, so they can't really take it without some serious work
03ROFL
lmfao
if anything
if you really want to add an oper block for me go ahead...I'll only really need to use it for backup purposes
in case something kabooms and stuff

03I literally LOL'd at that
lmfao
drf has the oper block, finishing the link block
alright
PM me the oper blocks, drf?
oh nvm
xD
so SSL and ziplinks for the server connections?
03does that give us op override btw? LOL
or leaving ziplinks off
I'm assuming you are maintaining your own operblocks on that server
I didn't allow ziplinks
And as for here, I added can_override
03<Casey8> Diana Ross' husband died
03<Tarrier> how
03<Casey8> fell while climbing in South Africa or something
03<JennAway> that's sad
03<Bubbaprog> i guess there is a mountain high enough
for you at least, need to know which other active opers require it
03Aurora and Kyu
03the others dunno
hm
add those manually in the link I provided then
hang on
03LOL Arti doesn't have override ability?
03her loss :P
she uses /samode
it's not been required before ;p
requested*
rather
yeah, you can usually /samode but it's a services admin thing
x.x
drf, Kyu, Aurora?
yeah
and probably Feather too
maybe drf as services root, up to you though
03just add everyone, I mean, we're ircops for a reason
lmfao
03I mea
well stupid SSH is lagging
03*mean
03everyone that's on the list already :P
/me prefers an explicit list rather than a vauge "everyone" ;p
03well then
Feather, drf, Aurora, Kyu
03Kyu, Aurora, Feather, me
03yeah
Indeed
03not sure why Umbreon isn't on that list
03but I won't ask
He wasn't on when the oper blocks were made
03<Phaelax> so what am i suppose to do with 175GB of wrongly named mp3s?
03<EddieGordo> stick them on gnutella
03<EddieGordo> they already have a good collection going
03^ so true
/me adds that to his facebook quotes page
and haha
Deploying linkblock for island.lugia.us, you'll only be able to /connect to ocean from islands side, until the DNS entry is fixed
Ah
03OK
what about the password?
that will follow shortly
okay
03right well it's 6:30am here
03I should be going to bed
03just waiting until everything's taken care of
should be just about done
linkblock for island active, it should be able to connect now
alright, I'll just rehash and set autoconnect
Also, make sure you have a u:line configured for services.lugia.us, or bad things will happen ;p
yeah I do
I remember when I once didn't do that
x.x
bouncy modes yay
What is the network name used on istald?
Does the case match pertfectly?
island*
/me fails at typing
Yeah should
TheSkyTemple

03o.o
uh what
03but yes it does match as my autoconnect works there LOL
hm
I think it's the pass
hang on
:11:33:27: -ocean.lugia.us- *** LocOps -- Link denied (Authentication failed [Bad password?]) [@64.32.1.34.61440]
yeah
idk
I used the pass you gave me
the hell
is the servers name island.lugia.us? I suspect so, but just making sure
yeah it is
it's a bad password error...
In that case, remove the $ and + from the password
okay
done
03wtf
03still giving me that error
port 7000;
yeah
I have that
do you also have nohostcheck;, and ssl;?
oh, nohostcheck I don't have
hang on
I'll pm you the link block
seems to be a password error
03sigh
03well
03I'm so tired now that I can barely read my screen
:|
Alright, seeya drf
holy crap
it was the password
well, thats just silly
wtf
I don't get it
it was identical on both sides
yeah o___o
we arent keeping it as 'password' however ;p
yeah
I was going to say that
hm
I have no idea why that wasn't working
oh f
That password thing is still irking me
...well.

03yeah
03well not me myself
03I'm paying for the server.
Oh, that's why Arti got rid of nest?
03she got rid of it because it kept having problems and nobody cared enough for her to keep it
03and I offered to get the new server
I see
Oh nice, island :FD

Then again, I could understand why; nest was hosted on consumer-grade hardware, behind a consumer-grade router, with a consumer-grade internet connection, using a consumer-grade OS and likely a consumer-grade ircd too.
And gah >.>
And Alienware just isn't known for its five nines uptime :)

i'm here!
I sawie
I was multitasking
@ the thing Sky said: If a founder doesn't want something, it's not implemented (and the other way around) - no exceptions.
lol
Of course, unless an owner is just being totally stupid and/or trolling his/her community for some reason, then everyone should just leave, point and laugh.
lmfao
You should have binded to one of the vhosts
03nah
03I don't really care
03though
[08:20:24] <Espeon> Of course, unless an owner is just being totally stupid and/or trolling his/her community for some reason, then everyone should just leave, point and laugh.
duh
!vhost tst.bot
not like Shiny would anyway lol
03...
03forget it
03not bothered to register it
you're lucky, i was gonna pickpocket you, steal your caps and stick a plasma mine in your pants =3
lmfao
10I don't see him doing anything near that
Well guys
03k
Here's how to settle this
for temp vhost, or I can add a vhost block in for it
I never said that. But I can never say "That's how it is, end of" without mentioning some extreme examples~
03yeah I see
03do that then
so you can /vhost TSTbot password
and get that XD
Whoever pays for the server makes the rules
10lul
10he lurks
10and hasn't appeared in a long time
10so no
10he is not "top" in charge so to speak
Shiny is the founder
Altair and I are administrators
/me pickpockets guest and steals all of their caps =3
Skylands and Espeon are moderators
so to speak
yeah, Shiny is the 'top' really
or should be
Who pays the bills
13wow drf
13I'm surprised
yay now i has money for bullets ^-^
:D
/me pickpockets Panda and sticks a plasma mine in her pants :O
10Slender man
/me runs away
/me shot
/me asplodes

03why
i took tha admantium skeleton perk and the lifegiver perk
oh, I *knew* "caps" sounded familiar

03why
and the one that gives you +10% resistance to damage
13I never seen you learn from someone on chat
13ever.
Or
03well now you have
You can look at it like baseball
You have the owner and the manager
the owner can do what he wants but he lets the manager do everything
/me giggles
10want me to add that to your opinion on the topic?
10too late, already done
i'm not even in the debate so do what you want
or i can go in a corner
10corners don't exist here
10sorry for the inconvinience

O_O
>getting filmed
7So...
HELL NO
/me gets filmed down
7Does anyone wanna give me tips on IVs for Celebi?
/me 7pokes Umbreon.
you should be poking Kyu
See that
I'm not on jack
All I see is a drawing
/me is watching you
02Everyone on the livestream is watching you
02Exactly
your lagging
badly
7o3o
10Security cams
/me 7pokes Kyu
03EW THAT FACE
07well first of all IVs are random so you can't do anything about them
07it's EVs lol
/me kills SSH
lagging piece of
02Not my fault
02That just happens on LS
10Security bree :3
7No, Kyu, IVs. :U
security bree?
7I'm resetting my event Celebi for them.
10Bree is short for Umbreon
10the Pokeyman
07.-.
I know what it's short for
but why security bree
07that's so annoying to do lol
7And nature, too.
02Because
02That's why
10well
you know what
10one of my forms are Umbreon
get a mirc theme
10so yeah
10I'm on security duty
7The event Celebi has Leaf Storm, Nasty Plot, Recover, and Healing Wish.
7Any suggestions? :P
Alright drf, vhost block is set
10by watching this livestream
works for me
10even though I can just keep the mIRC window open
07modest
maybe i can steal it's hand without having to kill it ^-^
now I poof
10dumb idea? maybe, but Idc
7'kay.
07and as for IVs just get them all as high as you can
that's the right way of thinking.
03wait is Celebi a wifi event?
07mainly in attack and speed
7Gamestop event.
10yes
03EW GAMESTOP
10putting more effort into something that's not worth it
lmfao
7Hey, the Legendary trio was Gamestop, too.
7And wi-fi.
02I like my background lol
xD
Good luck!
bbl
k
later yo
going to school/dentist appointment
Those things are hard little sucker
.-.
Those things are hard little suckers
....... I dare you to go all the way through the deathclaw quarry
/me 7can't believe Pearl's already 4 years old. ._.
My first Deathclaw in the first Fallout was horrible :x
I only had a pistol :x
10dentists are always fun
scratch that. RUN AWAY!!!!
Or some light weapon at least.
Trying the game again lately has always ended up in being killed in the bandit village near the first city x3
03well yeah it cam eout when I was in high school
03I remember playing Diamond in school
03Pearl I didn't care too much about
yo
i hear a noise that isn't my tv
where are my headphones
oh
that's what that noise is
02Lolol
tell that guy you press the numbers and hit start to use a microwave
7Well, Kyu, I got a Modest Celebi, but its stats are like, middle-tier.
07good IVs take forever lol
07I don't really care for them since EVs do more
That was random, and indeed
/me 7resets, then.
then tell her to press the numbers and hit start
numbers and start buttons are very confusing indeed.
02They can be
Also I like my timestamps better
10^ because they fit your timezone?
no
superiority.
10pfft
10seconds
10who cares about seconds
10they're meaningless
02If you press a number on my granparent's microwave, the number you push is how many minutes it will microwave for
07you only have like...a 1 in 100 chance of getting a modest one with an IV above 25 .-.
10No wai
07with a sp attack IV that is
my grandmother's microwave doesn't even have buttons, it's just turn the dial to how many minutes
02So therefore figuring out how to make it microwave for seconds instead of minutes can be difficult
02Logic disproved
I dunno what you're talking about
I don't get under your skin, right Skylands?
.
Yeah yo
02Lol
10People that get me mad are people who don't listen to my warnings
And you've never warned me for anything
10Right
02I have yo
You're not skylands and don't say yo
yo is mine
10yin yang yo
10whatever happened to that show
02I don't have to listen to you yo
02And I can get just as mad at people who don't listen to my warnings
well basically
disney realized it can't do cartoons anymore
and so it stuck to using 16 year old girls
02Who is the creator of this site/chat?

03OK well
03we want the YouTube script for the new bot
03and she can't really figure out how to get it to display runtime and stuff
03and you had the one that was on Cone, right?
I made the script, yes, or at least took an outdated one, improved it and made it actually work
03OK
Well it's a little longer than a PM but getting the length is just one line
i wish they didn't have to go o_O
I wish meat was vegetable.

err
03that is some seriously awesome stuff
there is some out there, but they all have a catch
guys
the trailer
watch
03because it's messed up
the best thing to do, is find an old box, and just run it off that
03if you say anything after it
03it won't work
weird
03which is why we want your script :P
Ah, I'll tidy it up then

ok
Just making sure talking before the video didn't cause anything
6DRF: the first part...
6Sounds like a bunch of different instruments on one line.
just make sure that vid works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBi7zwjp20E
ohai
No statistics available for this video!
and something's bork
oh yes
I disabled it for SW, lol
okay, once again, quick test then the bot goes: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBi7zwjp20E
No statistics available for this video!
hmm
6I'm sure if you shmush an orchestra's worth of instrumental notes on one line, it'd sound and look similarly.
03also
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdUy70dh8LY&feature=related
03check that out
i got annoyed a while ago
6I saw it. :P
well this is brilliant, my bot is broken
03LOL
lol
elitter is going to lose customers this way
6Ooh, spammy part at end.
good thing about mIRC bots, there's always just using it regularly
03XD
you gotta concider that its a free service too, right
yeah still
if you have an extra box lying around, i can help you get it up and running with eggdrop
which i do no0t
not^
trying it in another channel though my bot works fine with that link

03but the song has so many notes that it actually lags the program LOL
ah
03hm, apparently it was in the Touhou games too
fixed yay
Make the "YouTube" look like the logo like the past script plz?
/me flees
6DRF:
6You notice the notes are in different colors?
03um
03yeah what about it
6That means it's for different instruments. ovo
03o.o;
do you have any friends with one?
03it sounds like a piano the entire time to me
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ_wODRJCDs (Classic example.)
on hickstr, in dp193, theres a small photo of misty+brock+ash
6Well, because it's on a piano-MIDI program.
Make friends with one!
6And the tracks are smushed on one line. :P
can anyone find a video with more dislikes than likes so I can test something? (preferably less than a thousand of each though)
true.. true
03well
6Beiber?
that will have more than a thousand
D:
:O
I say.
6True.
I say, umm..
BLAM.
tuesday
03but LOL
03notice how around 2:11 it starts lagging
do you have any friends with one? <<< no
huh
would you have any uses for a server?
other than this, because you can definitely just buy one
if not, just rent one

yeah LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS
i know for a fact that you can get one with 10GB disk space for $13/mo
yay, even with significant 25 Hz components filtered out this is working great
6o.o
i don't have the money for a server
03LOL win
$13/mo?
Epic bieber fail
no
i would give you mine, but its full D:
6Please get off of me, cat, I'd like to get to my binder. ovo
LOL :o
03shoot it out of a cannon.
Yes!
Gorey death
hmmnice, I think now all I need to be fairly happy with the YT script is something to strip commas for a calculation ...
03well
03the other thing we're trying to do
:D
03is make it so quotes don't show as ;quot; or whateve rit is
that is possible though will require a bit more work
hey
how much would a small comp cost
a desktop
afkish class
with like, nothing installed
unless we're really lucky and mIRC already has a function to parse that, which I doubt
just the comp, and whats needed
lol
and a 10 GB HDD
can you even get 10GB anymore?
doesn't look to
o.O
if you're renting a server, it's probably actually a portion of a machine that serves lots of people
which is why it's much cheaper
/me waves
it's a tiny portion of the whole price
Hi Kitten :o
hey
wanna do my Java coursework for me?
it's horrid D:
huh
hi.. no?
03oh hi
yo
03we're talking about scripting
03XD
heya
hey Kitten
yeah I saw
AFK myself
Cat: no, but if you can find me a comp Without an HDD at a good price
i want it for like $50
I already have one of those.
or $75 er something
without a HDD?
yes
or with
idrc
i already have like 8 hdds here
like, a new cpu costs ¬£50 on its own unless you plan on buying a shit one
D:
CPU with everything?
there are companies that sell refurbished old computers
xD
my cpu cost ¬£146 :P
oh, and it cant be loud
03http://lostinthecloudblog.com/2010/03/13/john-stump-composer-of-faeries-aire-and-death-waltz/
03]hm
same goes for my graphics card
mine = $460
in its day
what is it? o.O
IBM
$260**********
lol
ah
I got kicked in the nads by my own owner-identifier on the bot, it seems
which is why it was ignoring me
but i want like a server to watch movies on
what kind of weird pc are you using?
IBM thinkpad
Thinkcenter*
surely the cpu itself isn't actually by IBM
it's generally either intel or amd
o_O
its intel
dual core
so why did you say IBM?
o.O
i meant comp
right
/me goes to the corner to cry
but i need a whole comp for like less than $100
when I say cpu, I mean the processor
fool
oh
I NEEED A COMP FOR LESS THAN $100
I set it up on the assumption that I'd have the same hotmask as the bot
6By the way, DRF: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_music
it seems I don't, so it ignored me
I'll trade you mine for a $1000 one.
for a server?
ok :D
yes
for a server
you can probably get it for less than $100 used
where?
ebay? NO
amazon? NO
check the local ads in the paper? i dunno
what's wrong with ebay or amazon?
03LOL nice
they dont have cheap ones
03so apparently Death Waltz isn't really Death Waltz.
I know you certainly can't build a new pc for less than $100
i could go for craigslist
an one here?????
go for it
03it's a piano arrangement of a Touhou song that was falsely named

13YAY
03assosis
13I've been picked
/me </end>
Well, left click the PC monitor icon on your taskbar (for your internet connection).
yeah
Click properties on the window that comes up
lmfao Sneas
yeah properties
03no
On the list of items in properties scroll down and double click Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
Click advanced
Click the DNS tab.
Click add
I like science but this pH shit is gay
ah
Type in Altair's IP address.
Enter
oooooh
And then scroll it up the list so it is at the top - it will be called before yours, or your ISP's or any others you have listed.
Using the green arrows to the right of all the DNS's listed.
:(
it'll either be noisy as hell, or it won't be capable of what you want it to do
/me starts shuffling cards
Then click ok
Ok, again.
ill stick to DVD player then :)
do you have any spare cases?
Okay, when applying to a local community college, and when I'm trying to state what country I live in, I don't need to scroll past North Korea, Afghanistan, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates to get to the United States.
Ok again.
13!shipping
Open up CMD
LOL
Type ipconfig /flushdns
That is very racist, and convenient
6Hmm...
you could get a mini-ATX motherboard for ¬£30 or so, a midrange dualcore for ¬£40 or so, and a case for ¬£30
6It's weird when I get existential. Ovo
that's ¬£100 though
and you'd still need a monitor and power supple
*supply
and keyboard and mouse
I don't mind scrolling past Canada and even Mexico
But not Tunisa and the Congo
o.O
Yesh
So I guess not Tunisa
When you get to Tunisa, you know you've gone too far
I have to scroll past all those to get to United Kingdom
D:
ok, that is strange
13Your not evil
ah, will that disconnect it?
No.
That's how you do it without DCing.
Ah
Just flushes your DNS caches.
It makes sense to put the countries where most of your visitors come from at the top for convience.
Ah right
Okay, thanks, we'll try that
I always put USA/canada/australia/UK at the top.
03*WB02(Kosovo02)03WB* - <Kosovo> Oreos, floofburds, and killer octopi...what more can you ask for?
when I restarted the service though last night, it kinda died
gave some random error
:O
my uncle lives in tunisia
6ovo
6You're*
6But other than that, that's an obvious comment.
and yes, it is very conveient, that way, you make the other countries feel bad *smirk*
13I know
03oooooooooooooooooooooooo
I didn't have an alarm clock yesterday, so I just made one on my computer with flash. XD
Nice

Also - http://www.ps3iso.com/showthread.php?t=26432 - lol at the 9.39TB list of PS3 games I can download. :)
;o
9.39TB
owwwww
Oh, 9.98, whoops.
!pokemon
._.
Altair
Kinda takes a whole day to download one game though - most are about 20GB big.
heya
Dragon Hearts 2 Demo is out
and dari, you can download that in a DAY?
pff
Dragon Age
Yeah, but I mean literally a day, 22 hours or so.
Yes, make sure you feel really bad because your country isnt listed on the top of a country list for an online form.
It's only about a constant speed of 250KB/s which isn't that fast, just seems it in comparison to torrents.
I want my users to be able to signup fast, and if 99% of my users come from those countries, it doesnt make sense for me to make them take longer to find their country in the list.
That's good
I guess I should also translate every one of my sites into every language I can so im not discriminating.
So apparently N64 emulator for PS3 soon.
and translate it to braille somehow for the blind.
13!pokemon
Lol, a braille PC monitor would be pretty cool.

It's just poor website design in my opinion
In fact, according to Alabama law, if you're not a US citizen, you can't enroll into a community college
!lag
Erm, if you're not a resident of Alabama***
Or something like that
They should remove every country thena nd just do states/
oh
well then thats not even required :P
!lag
O-O

Also, for billing forms, don't turn the credit card field into a password field

Wow there isn't one already?
I didn't think there was an N64 emulator on anything other than PC.
Hahahaha
who did that?
There's one on the wii, pretty sure there's one on DS
also look at this site http://www.apdsl.com
they claim to do webdesign for people too.
Hm, maybe I'm thinking gamecube then.
ipod too

PS3 security only got raped a few months ago though.
Isn't the guy who did it getting sued
geohot? Yeah, and team Fail0verflow
Crazy stuff
lol geohot
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iUvuaChDEg <-- He released the first PS3 jailbreak.
They're trying to sue loads of other people though.
And they're being sued for the same thing they sued geohot for.

I don't really sleep intentionally.
One of my friends has insomnia, virtually never sleeps.

They're even DRAGONS THEMSELVES
<Donnyku[Neptunia]> this game copied YuGiOh also
<GeneOB> >Blue Eyes uses White Lightning

oh that song that never played for his death?

yeah in kai it didn't
in the original it did
13you do have freedom
6I direct you to TV Tropes page And I Must Scream.

6not to my knowledge
6why
I want just the interface sounds
um... no?
But with BGM, eh.
That was how I got the VS Recorder sounds in Diamond and SoulSilver
Well, you'd probably want to do this
Get a ROM
use Nitro Explorer
03I misread that as get a room
Extract the .SDAT
...I'm already on a RO... oh.
:)
then go to a .SSEQ file in the .SDAT and replace everything but the header data with 00
Best to use VGMTrans with that actually
...You know what just use VGMTrans
Open the .NDS ROM into VGMTrans (click n' drag works, and only that).
Ah
Find the pokemon center music
Look at its data
LOL
Replace all the track info with 00
Bad DRF
done

immma kick the bloody

many damn errors

o_O
hah
03hm
03Music MasterWorks fails miserably at this MIDI
03wait
03now it's working
o-o
okay Drake
wot
@_@
03hm.
03Music MasterWorks fails too
03I think both of those, as well as Syntehsia or w/e it is, use the DirectShow MIDI parser
03and that's what's screwing up
o-o
imma give up
im so damn usless
at script at any language
and its always my bad luck
something doesnt work
or goes wrong
i cant have a damn simple bot
=.=
04back
o_O
wb Drake
it's simpler than you think it is
04ty
learn the basic syntax
then use logic to make scripts out of it
/me hugs Drake
/me hugs back
/me continues idling.
hmmm
perl was desent
decent
I'm willing to bet most of your errors are typos
as in running
Most of mine are
do you know why i gave up
larning perl
is it because of me
learning*
03...LOL
perl lmfao
perl is a pain in the ass
03QuickTime Player almost gets it right, then it just randomly borks
python > perl
perl is simple shit
03there's seriously like at least 25 piano notes at once
python > C > C++ > perl
that's how much I dislike perl :{D
03I need to find a MIDI engine that doesn't screw up like that
it gets a worse rating than C++ does
and I hate C++
But but but, my bot is total perl awesomeness
xD
Python ftw
See, I knew it
i though i was a sore loser
but i see that at the time
you sunk even low to like of no ones sunk before
do you have sibelius?
you were a bit of a prick
03no
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx02KOGhjes <- I'm curious what program that is thoughj.
03-j
everytime i asked for your wisdom in helping

03I've seen a bunch of MIDI videos on YouTube that use that same interface
also, try sweet midi player
._.
03you don't happen to recognize the program used in that YT video, do you?
learn PHP
if you were to lighten up a ton then just maybe people like me wont get pirckish at you
no
And you know for a fact im right
you know
well why open a help chan for perl
?
I didn't.
if you dont like help
Other people did and asked me to help
well you let it evolve into one
Wait you mean powerplant? That's my chill channel, all mah homies hang out there
im just pissed that i know for a fact there isnt a language out there were it comes nautrally
find yourself a language you'll like
so yea i admit i suck at all kinds of script
There's english
03...LOL Roni Music
try PHP or C
03I see why you like it
the fact is ManiZach whom i trust the most he said
it has lots of knobs :>
03LOL
03can you just tell it to play the thing and not touch it?
meh.
03Ultimately I want to make a WAV of it
audacity
afk now
03u
03*uh
You try hard and you fall hard, doing this is called trial and error, eventually what will happen is you being pro at everything.
>: sometimes is has its disavantages as i lose self esteem q.q
03Audacity doesn't do midi
03wait
03it does
03but wtf
it took me a month to learn hTML properly
even now I'm not that good at it
03uh
you need patience
03it won't play it
`ew
websites i suck at those
xD
programming languages take several months to properly learn
so just try one
and don't give up on it
and you'll succeed
anyway afk
I would say the best MIDI synthesizer for windoze is sibelius. it can render offline, and it has realistiche instruments if you install kontakt.
Drake go give him the "GO GET EM" talk or something
XD
imma move on to ruby
:[
04?
see if thats desently easy
Finale Notepad is not too bad either
03Finale is awesome
but it still sucks
03but I think that justs uses the DirectShow
xD
Ruby has some perl pythonishness, so I think you'll have a great time
anyway afk
03and I've already found out that does't work for this
Finale Notepad is eh
lol Roby
Ruby
not the best language
try C
Here, look at this, I came across these forums while googling myself.
seriously, it's a useful language
C is pretty simple, I learned a bit of it when I was 10.
sibelius and garageband & logic are options for mac. you could also use Finale Notepad but that is meh, as i said.
Remember none of it, but if I can learn it at 10 i figure it's simple
Oh yes and link that I forgot to pasta http://www.supportforums.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=18
c++ mani love
but when i look at it
make me wanna give up
03ew
:[
03Sweet MIDI Player lags just as much as winamp
03I want to say that uses directshow
you can also install commercial VSTi s such as Garritan and whatnot.
03can you just try this midi with your tools and see if anything can play it without horribly skipping?
Take the head on approach with everything
Copypasta enough and call it yours.
which wan
03the UN Owen song

well all of this is bacause at the start
you just want me to render it, right?
03yeah
03as a wav
of my exploring of scripts
03as for the file
and computer languages
wher r midi.
>flac, not wav.
you just want to play midi
MSL look hard so i used to C/P and call it my own
03http://www.sendspace.com/file/fl5im5
03there
or actually do something with it
=.=
03just play it
03and yeah flac is fine.
you try trinity?
loooked*
thats what i use on linux
past tense
pretty sure it has a mac port
03I'm on Windows.
I understand like none of it, but that's cause I never really got to use it much
/me feels stupid
032:12 on that YT video
03there's so many notes that most programs just start lagging horribly
Jibberishness and all.
¬¨_¬¨
i just hate clients
that over act for a tiny error
>:
why can clients point out
OW look
replace this with thie
this*
If you want to take a whack at perl again, I can devote the rest of my night to helping you, due to the fact I AM PROCRASTINATING EVERYTHING I NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW.
but no
err
ill try giving myself a rest from
dear god someone made a midi version of this song
getting a bot
will none of this stuff die
maybe in a few days times
i might try perl
i do know perl desently well
=.=
Lol
and the client
03what, the Touhou song? XD
doesnt need
YES
03it's a fricking awesome song
extra "modules
etcs
03wtf is wrong with Audacity
@_@ that does my nutt in
03it's randomly playing tracks at like 1000% volume and hurting my ears
Technically it is using extra modules, you just don't see them.
audacity has no midi support
DUN DUN DUUUN
o.O
ow
03yeah I have NO IDEA
but its like installed in the
they finally add it in?
ot script
03wait whast
03-s
:/
bot*
Yeah yeah.
03I'm multitasking
right
03this is a multitrack audio of a Bon Jovi song
03I'm saving it as ogg
i found my old
03but I'm playing it just to listen to
perl bot on
Pastebin
also, it sems to be playing fine for me
I press apple-J in garageband and reduced the tracks to 1 from 16.
about 3 days ago in fact
xD
03reduced?
then it only uses 20% cpu.
Neat
03you mean increased? o.o;
oh my god
thats scary
03I know right
at 5min
no, i am using software that i use to practice music
btw. is it 240bpm or what?
I've got to work on the new version of Luka, which is basically a huge rewrite of everything to make it a more "user friendly" experience. along with solving a million problems with stuff.
when i had a keyboard long ago
03dunno
03what program are you using n2
midillustrator
03hm
03and it doesn't use directshow? o.o
your luka
must be the size of like
a damn bible
@_@
Lol
no, it's its own thing as far as i can tell
It's past 1000 lines already.
well ya see its well on its way
wait...that does not make sense
The thing is, after you get past the things it needs to connect and parse 400 messages, all you need to do is add commands, which is nothing so you're pretty free from there.
all i wana as my ideal bot is
chan protection|blacklist|tourney|
sorta thing
03...
03it's not Audacity's fault, it's the tracks
i cant tell is microsoft's built in synth counts as midi for you
because i have no clue as to midi
hmm
:/
because right now its 4:30 and i am counting dshot as the set of codecs everyone has but everyone hates
03DirectShow is the Microsoft thing, yes.
Wow I type long lines, most of these nearly reach the ends of my screen, and I have a pretty big screen, and a small font. Interesting.
http://i55.tinypic.com/2611z0p.jpg
plays fine for me
even that scary part
xD
03hm
03it's called what?
midillustrator
03OK I'll check it out
Yeah I'ma play with minecraft seeing as I still don't want to mess with Luka.
03which one, Maestro?
i doubt it will do anything if you have problems with directshow
yeah
the player wont play mid files
03I don't have problems iwth directshow
03it just doesn't like this midi
yeah but if you are having problems with directshow, this wont help much
03LOL "Base 1"

03see what that does in your MidiIllustrator
03it makes a skippy sound
03and the parts after it, like in the 120s don't sound right either
hmm..
when it will start i will tell you
yeah, i see what you mean
03OK
fair enough then
03it's because of the sheer number of notes
03Windows' MIDI rendering just breaks
lol
that sounds a lot like any of these crazy japanese things
03it is
03it's a Japanese song
i know
i have the flac somewhere
and the game that it went with
and i was refering to anything in general
i also rush into thing to fast expecting to instantly learn it

03I wish I could change it to English though
the biggest i crated
+h
was like a super simple
its a japanese application
query blocker
which i lost
=.=
at least be happy its not in shift-JIOS
*shift_JIS
due to a computer reset
which is what this stupid website is in
xD thanks
shift_JIS?
i got a youtube identifier
japanese input system
based on a old
hawkee script
wanna see it
its kinda like ASCII for japanese characters
its used on older stuff
while newer stuff moved to UTF-8
ah
03wait wtf
03it's asking me for some sort of serial number or somethign
well pretty much all the scripts on NS|VNC are coded by me
with the exception of the weather scripts
and the scramble scripts are modified versions of something I found on hawkee
but that was when I was a noob at msl
so I'm going to rewrite those scripts
hmm...
03I don't speak Japanese so I really have no idea x.x
the regex bit i really copyed out of an old hawkee script
:/
ah you POS
jengjaenrgjvaen
like the regex to me is soo mind stressing
04bed

Can't stop laughing.
nice tune
bah dmanit
i am out of time
to deal with japanese-language installers: install ATLAS translation dictionary (by pirating unless you want to pay), then Translation Aggregator (first google result for that), then there's a setting in TA that lets you inject a dll that translates windows menus
the installer is the same in english though...
xD @ cazzy's picture
haha
some installers do things differently on occasion so having a way of telling what it wants on a random screen is useful
The uploaded bit doesn't work x.x
and it doesn't work when there's no http://

[03:16] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b14kz7Qa62E
wtf
is it just lagging that badly or did that just not show or I have it on ignore?
o.O
that's from the local client
wtf
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b14kz7Qa62E

03uh
03what
03oh
though it's irritating that apparently it can't find the uploader, again.
it's giving ELSEIF unknown command
03LOLwut
	ELSEIF Unknown command
... what.
you f'd up a } somewhere
wtf is it doing
dunno
and the alarm is going off so that is my cue to leave
there's like a hell lot of ELSEIF Unknown command
in the status window
in the huge block of elseifs I edited I didn't even use {} since they're not necessary
xD
good luck finding where it is necessary then
I also didn't add in non-HTTP:// support but I can put that with this next update
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b14kz7Qa62E

does it say what line?
nope
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b14kz7Qa62E

iiit's a little slow.
yeah it is
maybe I can speed it up by adding something like a check for any HTML tags in the line, so it'll skip any pure-text ...
but I think most lines have HTML
so the regex for that would make it even slower

epic lag
... I hope.
bot miiiight want restarting just to clear everything
oo
Touhou.
http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/24/apple-unveils-thunderbolt/ <- Oh great
my computer feels obsolete again
fun
Never mind
I will get a new computer when Windows 8 SP1 comes out
That should be about 2013?
2014
Then I will ask for the latest and greatest in everything'
full suite of Thunderbolt and USB 3.0 ports
latest 8-core or 12-core processor
12 GB of RAM
4TB SSD hard drive
over 9000$
Graphics cards that will even make Crysis cry
I have doubts how useful 10 Gb/s would actually be
Over $9000 today, affordable in 2013 or 2014
I predict
I don't
to anything other than dedicated server hardware which is already faster
Hmmm.
I'll keep my i7-860, 4GB of DDR3 ram, 32bit OS and a HD4350 until I need to upgradre
I should still be on my Logitech Solar Keyboard by then
I don't see this getting obsolete or breaking anything soon
*anytime
And as for my monitor
If Dell makes an affordable LED IPS monitor with glossy black bevel and white accents, I will buy
Otherwise sticking with this one
I have an i5
But I also use 4GB of DDR3 RAM
I have a HD 4670
And 64 bit
64 is meh to me
I have no real use for it
Well, sooner or later you are going to run into apps that demand or run best under 64-bit
You know
Talking about displays
And that'll be when I upgrade my entire PC
What could be best is to have an LED IPS monitor
with auxilary holographic projectors
That is my future fantasy
Keyboards of the future will either all be flat and thin with scissor switches
Or bulky with Cherry or buckling-spring switches
Mouse, no more
In the future everyone uses a touchpad or touchscreen
And in the future everyone uses USB3.0 and Thunderbolt
Computers of the near-to-mid future will have 8 cores or more
4 cores will be the minimal standard
And computer cases will all look sleek and minimal
with no obnoxious lights
I hate touchpads
Well,
Touchpads with multitouch technology
I'm intending to get a Wacom Pen & Touch
My fingers are too sweaty to use them
It's a tablet and touchpad rolled into one
I think that should be better
than using a mouse
You know
Screw it
I might as well start saving up on buying a new iMac now
Or a new Dell
If I'm going to buy an iMac, it's just to annoy drf
Buy an iMac
Post a picture of it here
EVERYDAY
Sing praises about
it
Annoy him to no end
(I will still install Windows 7 on it)
/me hides
Or maybe Windows 8
I don't like what Apple is doing to Mac OS X
They are cheapifying it
In Lion, especially

computer cases tried sleek and minimal previously, everyone moved to fancy, I doubt it's going to go back
4 core minimum is unlikely in the near future
mice going out of use is more-or-less impossible, the mouse is too precise a tool for everyone to go to something less precise just because it's better for the wrist of something
even less likely to occur because the new proposal is fancier

that's a really bad sign
when i pulled her from the car she was covered in blood
:(
but i couldn't exactly leave her in there, i smelled gas
:/
yea that sounds really bad
yeah :(
sorry :/
and my fricking head hurts like hell :(
altho i'm gonna have a wicked scar on my face when it heals

Scars are awesome by default.
Hope you and Nikki will heal well and such D:

Hi Cat
hello
this time it won't let me get on anything except IRC
!musicftp
ftp://pkmnmusic:pkmnmusic@fma1394.hoshinet.org
Do you know what the problem is?
I refuse to meet their network requirements, so it boots me off
it'll work for a while before realizing I don't have what they want
Hm.
Hi, Catwat
it worked fine for all of first semester
Can you ping google?
Oh, I'm still connected to the internet, so probably
What happens when you try to go on a site?
it just redirects me to the "remediation" page after a while
Hmm.
he's at school
it's only a list though.....
can't acsess it
it looks like...music libary's?
Your connection has strep throat. Should be fine in under a week.
That'll be 176 dollars.
Maybe check packets sent/received by a computer that does meet their requirements and compare it to yours?
When you try to open google or something.
Hmm
How do you check the packets?
You could dl net tools.
Keep it on the DL, though.
Lol.
O_o
It's riiiiiidge racer!

I'd look at it but I"m at school
can you screenshot it or something?
because my internet at home has been really crap
03like, there are a lot of Japanese MIDIs on YouTube that have that same program
03and that thing can obviously handle the most insane music
can i 128kps AAC instead?

03there's your screenshot

6yeah it does
i think so
6I'm looking at some of the other videos
6and yeh
it's not that that program doesn't lag
6wait...
03I even tried Sibelius
it's that some program combined 16 midi tracks into onw.
03that lagged too
03ah
03that's what the Japanese one did XD
*0ne
03can you just send me the midi?

6that program
i can send you a .gband

Hm?
03o.o
and heya Xeli
03so it can import MIDI but not export it?
03wtf kind of crap is that

Hi, Catwat.
This is channel in mourning! As you can see from the black text in the topic :o
AAC is not crap
I'm not good at mourning :/
its a more modern and efficient codec than mp3
03I never said AAC was
03I said whatever program can import MIDI but not save it
heya Luna
03that being said I still prefer MP3 over AAC because the tags actually work in Winamp
the AAC tags work in Winamp too
FLAC tags don't work, either
03gtsdll doesn't like them
FLAC tags work in Winamp too
(we're talking about UTF8 tags with GTSDLL)
what?
utf8 <3
then don't use GTSDLL
its depreciated anyway
AMIP works better
03eh
AMIP won't work with FLAC UTF8 on my one
03I prefer gtsdll
sad times :(
I was never able to get it to work
plus AMIP supports more format tags
bbl
AAC, FLAC, mp3, and others
ÿ¨Ÿàÿ¨ŸÑ ÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖÿ©
03ft
03OH MY GOD
basically anything Winamp can play even if its only through plugins

03hm?

I said you can use Pok√©sav to modify a .sav file to be like the one on your cart
03dude
03no
If not you can just make it so you're at the ruins :P
03unless you actually have a dump of it
03it's REALLY REALLY REALLY hard
03to make a legit save
03same with making Pok√©mon from scratch
ho
Nah, I did it a few times
03Pok√©sav should only be used to modify small details, not try to recreate an entire save
err

i'll make another render with a 16track. now it's 44% cpu.
oh

Some details that can be edited in pokesav aren't always that small btw o.o

Welcome back
03ah hm
03Finale NotePad managed to turn this into a one-track MIDI for me
03but the tempo is off
/me hug Sky ^^
03I'm trying to find a program that can change that
Oh, so it is your eMail? :o
:O
no
Explain why you did not want spam there then? :o
he was on my shell
well, our shell
and wb Skylands
10hi
whats up
I was just thinking about RocketGang and looking at the forums
tired, class
x.x
/me also tired
I am starting to have doubts about that group's survival
03:<
I'm gasping for breath
/me hugs people randomly
hi ariste
/me hugs back :3
/me is now dead because Sneas strangled him
xD
not providing anything unique
set 224 bpm.
03wtf though
I ran fucking maybe 2400 meters
03in this .mus, it changes temps all over the place
03It should be 224 all the way through, yes?
garageband 3 supports fixed tempo.
which I'm guessing entirely
03so does anything else
xD
03but the song itself changes them
fun
G4 supports variable tempo but you need to set it yourself
try without stopping
and constantly panting
sibelius supports variable
then running at the end
so much fun
and the danger with combining it into 1track, is that overlapping notes may interfere.
this is what happened with my 1st render.
xD
hi honey
/me takes a step back
03hm there we go
03Music MasterWorks let me just go and delete all the other temps
03*tempos
03let's see how this handles now
lol
this is kinda ez
03you have any use for a .mus file though?
03that's the original sheet music of all of it
no.
the finale UI is too flashy on a mac.
03LOL
03I love that program for Windows
03but I'm used to 2003a, back when it was legitly free
i liek sib better
and ive only really used sib & gb, so i'm biased.
03darn.
03it still fails
03whether it's 1 track or 16 or whatever
try http://www.mediafire.com/?l6b3kd8whfm91 owen16. i fixed the 1:59 problem, i think.
03same problem
03it's the sound buffer prolly
03LOL stupid Macs
humm
03"Jun Hong's Album"
03it did that same thing to Aurora when she saved a mp3 of something to show
it is too quiet in here
03it just sticks the person's username in the artist field
nah, it's GB's fault.
03ooh
03yeah this new m4a works :)
03though
03any way to make the piano sound more like DirectShow's version?
03it sounds kinda odd
03o.o
you mean using a sh** quality MIDI soundbank?
03yeah

ok
03eh
03if you don't use the first letter at least people don'tknow what you're trying to say

also, since * can stand for any letter, f*** could mean fail

6yeah but
6please don't
03yhv
6if ANY words you use, don't use that one
6even censored
03eh
03I have no problem if people star their words out
03but that's just me
6yeah just you
6junh, please don't
lmfao
I censor myself all the time
6at the f word I mean
I have no problem with censoring too
6while i hate swears in general, the f word is really the only one i'll be strict about
6k well
6good for you
Well
if you really want
6then again
back
6this chat isn't really tst chat anymore
I can set up the bot to kick f*** or similar
6so really there's no point
it isn't?
o-o
6what you seriously thought it was?
6chat was removed from the site, nest was taken down, drf now runs the second server, no one really listens to people anyways
6not relly tst imo
6*really
I see
:3
6anyways
People do listen but you have to enforce it...people show a lack of respect
6for courtesty
I probably do too
6>.>
6ok well
But yes, respect
6it's hard to enforce something
then kick them
6when the other mod here says "i don't care"
haha
it's still your choice though
6otherwise I don't have a problem
so you can actually go ahead and kick the user
6yes I'm aware i can kick people
6and I do
6but at the same time
Well, the swearing rules we have are very important to me
6I was just mentioning to junh
6etc
6anyways
6I need to do homework
6and other crap
6related to school
6cuz it sucks

6it's weird feeling your heart skip a beat O_o
03<Aurora> chat was removed from the site, nest was taken down, drf now runs the second server, no one really listens to people anyways <- how is me running the second server making this any less of TST chat
6like
n4
6literallu
6skipped a beat
o.o
nope
6I'm sitting here measuring my pulse, and it skipped like 2 beats o_o
n1
03hm, so what I can make of this
03the song is actually just called something like S Flandre's Theme
6S?
03not sure where UN Owen Was Her came from, that's probably just some stupid English dubtitle
6where'd they get s?
6no
hi
6that's the original name
and there's an n2 ;o
03the letter S is actually in the title
6I have the japanese albums
6ok
6well
03http://pastebin.com/4FuByW3e
03see the letter S? LOL
6the phrase UN Owen Was Her is english translated
6but a direct translation
lol
well Aurora
!pokemon
Nick, you are a 14Staravia.
Well nobody wants to be a n3
03ROFL
6the s....might be for sister
03Google's translation
6...um, doesn't it already?
6oh
6wait
6nvm
03"S Flandre that black people tried to play more as a part divided into different"
03LMFAO
6yeah do that
it only kicks < censored>
6...wth?
03I just stuck that Japanese into Google translate
03I need someone who actually knows what this crap means
6wow lol
XD
._.
03that's just mode +G
03but see
03honestly
03if someone's bothered enough to censor themselves
03why should they be kicked?
03I'll be like "This is f***ing stupid" and whatnot
03using 3 stars isn't really swearing :P
the thing that makes me support censoring is that without it people come in swearing just to appear to be internet thugs or something
03because in real life I say "this is f'ing stupid"
that is truly obnoxious
6ok
6drf
6here's the original, untranslated theme title
6U.N.„Ç™„Éº„Ç®„É≥„ÅØÂΩºÂ•≥„Å™„ÅÆ„ÅãÔºü

03it's on the very top of the sheet music, at least.
6U.N. Owen wa Kanojo Nanoka? is the japanese title
03weird
Hello Nick
6which translates to UN Owen was her
6yeh
Or you can get just the latin :P

well people can learn to ignore that crap
except they don't
03but they're all "Yo yo my n****" and whatnot
yeah
03so then others use it
03and they rage
03and I'm like
03you brought it on yourself
xD
LOL
Well those use the word almost like some people say "sup bro?"
that's kinda odd
03yeah
and if a white guy says it, OMG RACIST
/me HIDES
The do that to me.... and I'm white lol
/me shot
XD Xeli
*They
Dats so Racist
But yeah.
it's like SpooKy doing yo momma crap
>automatically lose
03yo momma ftw
I remember he did that
03well
I see some people finding damn, hell and so on to be like really offensive, that's not something I agree on personally
03I do your mom jokes all the time
well you don't use it in arguments
02FFF
and yo momma is funny, but not when it's like
03LOL Ray
03that's why you need a script
02yep
because it's basically like you automatically lose the argument
"I ran out of arguements (as in calling people gay) - so I must make a yo mamma joke!"
6Godwin's Law?
^
03well yeah
03but I'll do that when it's funny
Well
Sure
03like if someone's all "oh this is stupid"
03I'm like
03your mom is stupid
XD
Yes SL, just with yo mamma / powerwords instead of Hitler comparisons.
well that's not exactly yo momma @ drf
03Hitler comparisons?
03and yeah I know
uh well
tl;dr everything was funny before people started overusing it
derp
12hi Espeon
03XD
03yeah
!espeon
Just a suggestion, but I do think there should be a kick for poorly censored f words
I don't find internet memes funny
03it depends on what it is
03I find the over 9000 stuff funny
03well
I in general do not find them funny, but I'm not like those
03depends on how you use them
03XD
scroll up and look at the discussion
"OMG it's mainstream now it sucks"
yeah it does
03but if it's like
people
03I have over 9000 tests this week
03or something
03then sure go for it
if it's used at the right time it can be funny
but if used like zomg every damn line
I mean over 9000 is almost a part of my language xD
then no, it's not
03<Espeon> I mean over 9000 is almost a part of my language xD <- this
instead of saying like "gazillion" or "umpteen" or something
yeah but retards who use it every line?
if something i HUGE
03yeah
then it's over 9000
03exactly
I've seen it
03same
This sound wave travels at over 9000 meters a second

IT KEEPS HAPPENING
hah Xeli
is my current catchphrase
xD
BRB, laptop logoff/reset
I dunno whether I have a current catchphrase
Also I find it funny how many people just have "admin" as their router password
/me hides again
although it's probably gtfo or stfu
and Xeli XD
mine doesn't have a password
because I cbf to set one
XD
mine has one, but I didn't know until recently when I dabbled in the forbidden art of MAO out of curiosity
and that's just a glitch in agame, don't think of it
xD
/me dies
xD
[05:49:48] <Espeon> Also I find it funny how many people just have "admin" as their router password <-makes my life easier
hah
oh hey n2, do you have a mIRC mailing script? lol
like, send mail from mIRC x.x
no
i cant imagine it would be that hard to make though
rofl Majin
hmm...unless you use gmail or something
ALL serebii ops are idiots
yay!
Tomorrow I'll change my WB message
yeah, sending mail seems really easy
mew
again, if you dont use a service like gmail where SMTP is required to go over SSL
then you will have to figure out the overhead of establishing an SSL connection
Serebii and intelligence can't co-exist.
Ever.
[09:57] <Espeon> Serebii and intelligence can't co-exist.
[09:57] <Espeon> Ever.
^
ah serebii isnt that bad
:<
when you take him out of his element
er...take him out of his channel
XD
i think i blew up everyone's heads
xD
Well, touhou music blew up my laptop's music playbac
icba to fix that
well n2
I can use Horde/SquirrelMail
dunno
/me appears.
xD
Serebii is a fucking disgrace to the damn internet
the key is to use a service that allows you to use an external mail client
if they say it can connect with outlook or thunderbird, you are probabally fine
because fact of the matter is nobody wants to write a script for a web interface
too easy to break shi..stuff
4chan is too lol
Derp
/me is dissapoint
find a service that allows POP3/SMTP
Oh no!
send the mail via SMTP
Kill it with fire!
and call it a day
:<
knowing how spammers ruined mail though, it probabally wont be easy
xD
well as long as it's not sendmail
sendmail is buggy as HELL
initial findings say it should be easy
nope
connect using SMTP and send the correct commands
is it possible to send via cmd?
or well
define cmd
I could use PHP's mail function
get mIRC to message the CLI interface
wait, what?
wtf
-interface
are you using mIRC or PHP
Bah
mIRC
*mIRCscript
yeah
where did php come from?
well, php has a mail() function or something
yeah, but i mean how did php come into the picture here
couldn't you create a page and then have mIRC do some socket crap and do stuf f on the page?
idk
that seems like uncessary overhead?
*unnecessary
idk
you are using sockets to connect to an smtp server?
I don't know much about mail
least of all smtp
fffffffffffffffffff guys
do you know what POP3/SMTP or IMAP is?
Black/White doesn't have game corner at all ;_;
yeah I know what they are
great
but I don't know how they work
they're protocols obviously
well, thats why god gave us google
xD
hm
and the glorious RFC documents
I wonder if I could do it via ZNC...
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0821.txt
would you look at that
xD
a document explaining everything you need to know about SMTP
D
XD
this actually is a good song for channel separation tests on stereo transmitters
xD
well I'll see what I can figure out
take a note from mail clients
office only uses SMTP to SEND mail, not receive
*outlook
thats the point of pop3
sense
does not make
ah
well this only needs sending
so, what is stopping you from just making your own mail client
not receiving
the simpliest thing in the world
it makes sense to me
*the simpliest mail client in the world
Ellie is fail, she needs a gline
:>
most of these protocols are really easy to read
and work with
/me back
/me is back*

I'd /os chankill SPP if they moved here lol
rofl
DO IT
ah
MAIL <SP> FROM:<reverse-path> <CRLF>
ort errors. If accepted,
the receiver-SMTP returns a 250 OK reply.
Also I've made a few posts to the forums
:D
you are even familliar with the style from working with sockets and the http protocol
sockets aren't my thing
nice :3
sockets are annoying
but when you need to use them, use them well
/me hugs
yeah
/me hugs the skies.
and not halfas..wing it like what i did with mircservices
Tesla attack was effective.
I don't see why people bother with sites that's not worth bothering with.
XD
xD
also Xeli
just posted TCTL chapter 5
that was my first and last script using sockets
TCTL? o:
SPP is a piece of shit, infact brb gonna troll SPP
To Cross The Line
on HoR's forums
xD
/late by 16 minutes
16 mins?
how do you figure that?
whois
I have a +E module installed that is for normal users and serves the same purpose as +W
I have it set on myself
I'll see tomorrow.
I'm just wondering where 16 comes from ...
since I'd spoken more recently than that on other channels but far longer here
Ah.
/umode2 +E
okay XD
Oh yes, your script works really well, thanks
o-o
03were there any other ones that you made for Cone?
:p did some quite thorough testing on the basis of how it works, so after that prompt it only took a little work to get it to that very good stage. And only the forum post reporter
I read it
were things like !define on cone? I could have a go at writing those
xD
03no
You should read Reminiscence
I need to rewrite it though
beginning and stuff sucks
lol
I have +E on :D
minus the scripts I don't have and !chatstats
I'll set that up one day in the future
k
how would such work?
B/W are being released soon, right?
ie; what would it do
As in March
idk
I'm waiting for Yugioh 2011
Cuz if so, I'm fucked
._.
well
it'd mail some stuff to an email address
/me bangs head on wall
Basically, I'll have to decide between CoD and Halo map packs or B/W
:(
o.o
n2 I suck
end of story
XD
and i thought my rants would have meant something :(
/me runs from HML
Iiii could try though it would be useful to know what it would be mailing
well I sort of understood it @ n2
but I don't think i'm good enough to write a script for it

Fail situation
what does it say? I cbf to load on proxy
thanks
k
n2 explained about smtp and everything
and mail protocols
herp no one can akick ellie didnt do it serebii doesnt care shuttup
And I'm supposed to magically know the access defaults were changed?
I chose to accuse Ellie because: One, she does have enough access to add and view akicks if the defaults are there, and I doubt they're not. Two, another user mentioned Ellie takes care of the akicks now, in fact quite a few have. Three, I've seen her abuse before myself. I'm not going to dig up logs, do that yourself if you don't believe me.
?
And since when are network staff useless? Who the **** else are you going to cry to when you're under botnet attack? Make your own network and do everything yourself if you find them too "useless."
Would the Dark Brotherhood take any advantage say
the Empire fell
and basically Chaos was ruling Tamrieal
or Tamerial
Only thing that could be worse than Serebii would be a site full of elitists
oh wait
*Tamriael
I'm getting too tired to use logic now.
XD Xeli
inb4 then taking that as a botnetting threat

heh
if they got botnetted on their own network they'd be like "WTTTTF STOP LEAVING EVERYONE"
I knew Kirby is a prick

Majin, they do have default access levels

nope n2
talking about Serebii if they made a network

meh as a person I don't mind him but his actions well
can't really say much without bawwing
He is as stubborn and ignorant as fuck
well I'm rarely active on PS

I have copied the relevant log section into notepad to avoid losing it however.
ellie's got sop right?
...i can check my logs massive derp
Ellie has op

But I believe ops can akick
nope
though
access of akick can be changed
Yes

Well
I think I said it yesterday

oh cool
Yeah
ah
I seriously hate my computer
and this virus I have
infact
It's completely destroyed my entire connection to the regular serive
*server
with my backround stating it has an infection
hi
Do you have any advice on getting rid of a fucking anoying virus
that changes you're backround into 'YOU HAVE A VIRUS'
and basically maleware can't do shit
and since I'm on safety network
oh
uh
boot in safe mode with networking
then go to norton
I am in safemode
Norton?
norton is..what?
anti-virus
you've never heard of norton?
^
No
tell me how to get to norton
or if its downloadable
You get it free with comcast :p
:|
/me yawns
norton.com
and it'll install in safe mode?
seriously i can't believe you've never heard of it
it won't install
it'll do a scan

this?
yeah
except
there'
actually google norton 360 trial
because with that you have to enter your credit and crap
/me sweeps Ray off his head
So
Does malwarebytes suck ass
or is it because this virus is more complicated than it?
i don't use it, so i can't say
And norton will remove the virus, in what time frame?
malware-bytes might be for trojans rather than viruses
i don't know
that depends on your download speed and on your computer speed
then it can't find this Trojan then
rawr
which is in c:\ ginger something
:O
/me eats
hey
do you know anything about that?
There's too many viruses and trojans for me to know any paticular one
unless it was famous
though c:\Ginger doesn't sound like something a malware would hide in
it usually hides itself
well I've tried Malware twice in safe mode
it probably has some files in system32, and intered itself into your registry
the virus completely took over the regular
hey!
thats where they'd usually be
whats up?
in safe mode
it wants me to do it in regular mode

Does Windows Defender do anythig?

7I think I've found a style that incorporates both my drawing stylel and spriting style.

its like when I got an unknown hard error

and that means

7Of course, my odd mentality has me that I have to decide on all sorts of alternate directions my art goes.
7!generate 1 7
7Script still hasn't been re-added?
'os' meaning original system?
operating system

though it might be an GP

HP isn't an OS
it's a manufacturer
I know, but its a Vista I believe

oh ok
come to think of it
in safe mode it's all 2000 theme isn't it
go to your control panel
and i forget how to get to system restore from there
it's under system or something
i can't remember on that damn 2000 theme

VNC > TeamViewer
Go look for your cards while you're there

Oh?
I should set up a VNC with my computer :E
D
VNC needs ports open and requires complex router configuration
XD
Team Viewer does not
yes
but VNC lags less
yes it does
hm
cool
VNC requires special configuration of your router
ubuntu is a retard
How so
:V
we tried opening ports to Sneas' computer
but it wouldn't work
oh wiw'
*wow
all the config was correct
and 6667 was working
you are required to open ports and in some configurations you can have problems involving accessing said open ports from the internet
but no other ports would
so itw as like wtf
it is
Ports are open for me
o_o
we ended up using TeamViewer
that is when you use Team Viewer
on ubuntu
What version did you have?

you'll have to ask Sneas

03I CAN'T PLAY SONIC WITH THE AUDIO BAD
03IT JUST DOESN'T SOUND GOOD

03LOL
03well
03s7ee
drf what the hell
Sonic Classic Collection
03it's called a Firecore
USE THAT INSTEAD LOL
03aka GenMobile
03dude
03the point is
03this is like a GBA
03as in
03you take a Genesis cart
.
oh
03stick it in the machine
03portable Genesis
03but
03it fails @ sound
03so
03I went and got myself a Sega Genesis Nomad
03that one is LEGIT
Virus
Trojan
:3
._.
fail
what type?
03OK so
03the DSONE
03the screw is missing
03just FYI
it was a /ginger
hm?
Screw?
03so don't throw it around or it might breka
03yeah
in C drive
03the screw that holds it together
tried Malwarebytes in Safe mode
03I went to fix something and lost the screw
03well
doesn't work
03you know where the MicroSD card goes in?
03on Supercards, it's spring loaded
Norton won't instlal
03as in, push down and it pops out
03the spring broke.
03so I had to rip it out.
and Microsoft Defender Doesn't do crap
03now it's just like the CycloDS, you just insert the card, no spring.
ah
K
my backround on normal says 'YOU GOT A VIRUS'
basically
fail
I'll prepare my fingernails for being hurt.
Again.
x.x
nothing works in normal mode
wheres the part where you help me
and I'll get Alex to as well
/me runs
03LOL
03well
03hm
and I'm grateful
never gotten it
03as for the GBA card
03it uses MiniSD
do you have a live boot CD?
03which is a fricking bizarre standard
03would you need this MiniSD to full size SD adapter/
03]?
first
what is that
second
best way is to boot into linux
I think so
I
do
Probably
Well
not
03it only supports 1 or 2GB cards, I'll give you 2GB with it
have
then remove the virus files via that
Linux
03with ROMs and crap too
I had a microSD to miniSD somewhere...
lol
Vista
But idk where it is
03see
64 bit
So just send the minisd
03this is MiniSD to full SD
03oh
:E
03I get what you're saying
03k
unless all vistas have a linux
03yeah I'll just send this
live boot into the linux CD
:3
._.
03lemme check something
03if there are files on it XD
You're so nice sometimes :P
Erm, explain
Since you're making no entirely of any sense
03XD
03well
03if you can get the stupid DLDI to work
03for REIN
03then go for it
03until then, no DS save dumping :/
03that's mainly why I don't want it
heh.
03I managed to get a Supercard that's older and actually works
03so I have two
03this is a newer one
guys there was so much fricking blood i can still feel it on me ;_;
Well
03instead of a stormtrooper on the label
03it's just a fireball :(
I don't play Platinum much :E
they found nikki and me 50 feet from the car in a pool of blood ;_;
03ah here we are
03MicroSD with the files on it
03er
03MiniSD
03I'll make a backup so I can copy it to the card I'm giving you
03yeah I'll leave off my Pok√©mon DP saves
03you prolly don't care about those XD
03they're hacked anyway
03OK so
03I will send you
03CycloDS, still in the box with the MicroSD card reader and crap, Supercard DSONE, by itself, Supercard MiniSD (GBA-sized), and a 2GB MiniSD card + adapter
03sound good?

Hmm?
03This is really odd

03Why would evolution cancel itself automatically in FireRed?
What is it then?
sunday morning
O.o

03I need to get it sometime
12i love how strict your government is
I couldn't care less about the events
I only do them since my sisters want them XD
03Main reason for me is for B/W lolz
Hmmm
12the US people just laugh at the system they don't care, it's almost like the criminals get more rights than the innocent
Zoura
Ew
03yep
Little fox thing XD
They could almost definitely call in the mental ward
/me has all the shiny dogs though
I have the japan movie event ones

12omg
12hi
hi Umbreon
yes it's me
greetings
It's umbreon
12how goes
12yes its me
goes well
12i wish i can say the same
Still ill?
12my mother died feb 11th to cancer
Oh
12and i have an aunt that has gone completely off the deepend and i'm afraid of what she might do
Sorry
/me hugs Umbreon :<
LOL
12murr..
Wha
What
/me goes off for his usual ice + drink
Wish I could do something for you
12don't worry about it
12unless if you have ties to the mafia and can put a hit out on my aunt
/me hides
Maybe you should talk to your aunt
wait what
12no you have no idea how loopy she has gone
You know, keep the family together with what you have left
12she thinks her name is the name of her mother and that her real mother is her mothers sister
12and she is threatening my father behind his back
is she getting help?
12no
Why?
12we called the police to discuss her behavior and they can't do anything
She obviously needs psychiatric assistance
sorry could not resist
12what i think she needs is to stop abusing drugs
And that
resist what?
People do despirate things in emotional times
12she is obviously crazy and with how angry she is with my father she'll probably do anything
I hope you can get the BW interface sounds quickly for me
You just need to stay together with what you have left of your family
the Nazi reference
12after mother died
Not at the moment :/
hmmmm....
12we pretty much pulled the entire family together
Actually, I might!
Get teamviewer
NOW
12from all over the country
12members we weren't in touch with and all that so yeah the family is stronger than it was before
12with my aunt or without
Be thankful for what you do have
12i'm too afraid of what might happen in the future to be thankful
OK
oo
12meow?
:3
Meow
:3
12yay
http://www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx <- This?
Well try
yep
12heh
12how goes Quilava
I can't say I understand because I've never had something this tragic happen to me, but the best I can do is offer some assistance
√íK Installing
I'm here for ya
Done
12thx..
12but don't feel obligated
Now what do I do?
12i kind of lost a friend over this already
12he thought i was only going to him for comfort and nothing else, then got ticked off and cut contact with me
well then he clearly wasn't a very good friend :|
12:/
and I'm ok
Get an account?
Clearly
A true friend would never abandon anyone, especially now
12good to hear Quilava
just bored out of my mind
do you want to get off this topic?
12yes a little
Okay then
12thx
12pokemon is also going dumb for me
12this set pretty much changes nothing for the metagame
Legends?
12lost world decks are crap
12yes
hi
sorry
Gengar is the only thing that works
Open up TeamViewer
12not really
Opened
Otherwise, lost world IS crap
Got an account in the meantime
k
PM me
12my friend made an absol/chatot/mime jr. deck that is effective
I can't see it any more effective than gengar
12not as effective as gengar but still decent
Yea
12thing is though that gengar loses to SP horribly
12since it's so easy to tech a weavile in
03Weavile :3
/me hides
I'm thinking about making a 3rd deck
out of random
12i have luxchomp, dialgachomp, lostgar, and that absol deck together
12and unown question mark
12which still remains my favorite deck
I already have 1/2 the components
12i wonder if i'll ever get all the cards for it
/me dozes off
Maybe
Nighttimes~
Night hml
12unown isn't a deck that is designed to win
12it's basically supposed to piss your opponent off
It's designed for annoyance
yep
124 Unown ?
124 Unown F (fake pokepower)
X
124 blaine's quiz 1, 4 blaine's quiz 2, 4 blaine's quiz 3
lol
124 misty's duel, 4 team galactic's wager
XD
Quick, think for once
12this is my favorite part
Thats an awesome concept for a joke deck
12are you familiar with unown Q's power?
free retreat
yea
12sorry not Q
12i mean ?
Yes, I used ? 2 years ago
12ahh
12well i play 1 of every type of pokemon in the deck
12without their basic form
Evil
12and blaine's quiz 3
12you know what that does right?
Not that one
No
12you put a pokemon face down on the table
12you declare the name of an attack it has and they have to guess what the name of the pokemon is
12if they get it wrong you draw 3 cards, if they get it right they draw 3 cards
12well there are 5 different pokemon in the deck with the same attack
12XDD
hidden power :p
12no
12and the neo discovery Espeon and Umbreon also have Quick Attack
Ooooooh
12then i play the platinum lucario
12and the base set wigglytuff
12so there are 2 pokemon who have "do the wave"
1 thing though
anything not from D/p and up is BROKEN
Aerodactyl fossil set
no evolving
EVER
12already have an unlimited deck with that
12so their basics can't attack or use powers
So does my friend -_-
12and btw
12rare candy breaks out of aerodactyl
12that's why the old dark vileplume is also in my build
Why not new vileplume?
Same difference
12the way it works
12is before DP
ok
This is why sets dont mix
12what
hah
03lol Nugget Bridge
In BW?
03wut
03It's in Kanto
Bah, whatever
LOL
Anyways, off to sleep for realz
/me flops
12!Pokemon
/me looks at Quilava
12having a feline char is weird
being bored all day sucks
12hmm
12it does
12so boring that i got an exercising machine thing lawl
:/
12purr
if I weren't so lazy I could be doing something productive
:3
/me hides
and lol I thought 1920x1080 is the standard pretty much nowadays.
orly
/me is a kitty
12not a chime
its not
12i will just exercise a little so i don't turn into pudding
well there are a number of monitors that are 1280x800 or even 1024x600 for tablets
I'm too lazy to do that even
you only see 1920x1080 on the big monitors
hmmm
on the smaller ones it makes text difficult or even impossible to read usually
I do have a reason for big ones
12D:
with the exception of displays such as Apple's Retina
12you can draw
I do some photography work sometimes
And no I don't find text impossible to read here
for that I could justify the purchase of a big monitor
its because yours was designed for 1920x1080
Hmmm?
Oh native resolutions
right
That's a whole different league
native resolutions determine the "standard"
Well, most monitors should be either 1920x1080 or 1680x1050 nowadays
well no
Except for notebooks, where it's smaller
at the bare minimum what you need for browsing the internet its a width of 1024
I have seen 13xx x 768 on a notebook
you are acting like 100% of computer users need 1920x1080
that is not true
like I said... I could be doing something productive
Hmmm
but likely not going to :/
I thought it was pretty much standard already
/me pets bree
:2
:3
it is not standard
So what's the standard mid-range nowadays?
/me rolls
1280x800 usually for laptops
12eep
laaaa
LL :3
hi
.-.
And to think Apple is planning even higher-resolution, lrger monitors
hai
/me pets
hai o.o
/me is umbreon
Apple Cinema Display
That is all
12...2 drf's
price is another factor
12just what we need
Those are, HUEG
these bigger monitors cost a great deal of money
And I mean, HUEG
egh.
Indeed
Though this Dell cost me about SGD$300+ when I bought it
03fklnkip[pppp
It's TN and non-LED though
But good enough for me for now
/me hugs Quilava
When I start doing art more seriously I will consider IPS

hm
6granted
Well I don't need to replace her
Anywhere I want LOL
6DO IT
k
When I get home :V
6AND DON'T MAKE IT A ONE TIME BATTLE LIKE EMERALD
6cuz
XD
nah
6that's the reason I never battle him
well
6he vanishes after that
6;-;
Aurora, I dunno if I can do anything that advanced :P
I'll see if I can
There's a peadge preening on my window
;o
sure
TWO PEADGE
S
6PEADGES
Like, make it a daily thing like battling Silver
hm
6that
Maybe dipping into HeartGold can help o.o

/me 6glares at homework
PEADGES
Lulz

Did you know that the Kanto gym leader music was left unused in B/W?
/me 6runs
hur
6yeah
6along with kanto champion music
wait
I meant champion not gym leader FFFFFF
6lololol
Blue is also a gym leader though, so |D
|D
6I think
maybe :V
6I'm gonna take a shot at IN again
6cuz
k
6I got to mokou's third card
I can spend a day trying to crack a .sseq file so I can add loop points if you want
:P
Do you want the rival music like in Emerald or the champion music like in R/S
?
6freaking Flying Phoenix spell card though
6I hate that card
6NOT FAIR AT ALL LOL
lol
6um
6champion
k
I love that one anyway
I took a photo of the peadges with my iPhone
hm...
They flew away immediately after
I think I can ask utuber6061 if I can have his .sseq for the RSE Champion remix
6wth........
That would be cool :?>
6IN is on my mac
*:>
6I thought it was on here too
6dfrgdthf
6ok
6time to get my butt kicked
6several times over
I can arrange that
although I beat pcb the other day
since the first time I got to yuyuko i was so confused when she didn't die :'D
6lol you beat it on normal?
no
6lol
to tell you the truth I've only touched that game like twice :'D
o_O
6same
6but I only play normal lololol
I play all my games from easy
no matter how easy they are XD
TST's IRC is sort of dying...o.o;
there's less users than before...
yup
12D:
.-.
12i'm worth at least 5 people
I'm worth the world.
ahahahahhahaaha not really.
I'm heading to bed folks
bye Silver
:'D
xD
TST hasn't hit 30 since Arti left...
well, she took her server down
actually well, it hasn't really gone above 30...
sob
07well that's because the chat isn't on the site anymore
anyone know what's the deal with Arti's server? Apparently she's hosting an IRC server for friends on it...
o_O
really?
07only instructions on how to connect from mirc/mibbit
well true
6DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANGET
well mibbit it's slightly pointless
as I've posted like
6I GOT PAST HER 5TH SPELL
6GASDSFGH,DGNDFNGDZKFJBGKDJFG

.-.
6oh jk

6 4th spell
6BUT STIL
07yeah
07but we're trying to curb the entrance of noobs
/gzline noobs@*
:D
12how was i supposed to know that
I mean hi
07seeing as you have to know a minimum amount of computer knowledge to get onto chat in the first place
true
noobs don't usually stay long on my network...not at all...
they either leave or get banned iirc
hey Aurora

Aurora
I might not be able to put in the music ;.;
I gave him a 1d gline for harassing via PM
Nobody knows how to loop tracks for .sseq files so :/
sseq? what kind of file
Except this one guy utuber6061 who won't tell anyone how he does it
A nintendo DS sequence file
then a 7d for doing it again and a 30d for ban evading
XD
probably still hasn't expired
o
the equivalent of a nintendo DS midi
If you can make a looping .SSEW
*.SSEq
bbl mum home

How's things
Also
I found a version of VGMTrans that appears to work properly
Though I can't edit the hex
You're not suppose to
The HEX isn't an editor- it
's a viewer
I dunno WHY...
But you look at the hex as a base, pay attention to the offsets of the files, and go to them in your HEX editor
Ah
Then how do you put the edited files back in?
I'll help you later with some of this stuff ;P
Nitro Explorer
but again I need to help you later
You're going to replace the note's instruments so they're completely inaudible
If the instruments don't exist it won't play anything :3

6It's a bit tricky drawing folded hands. ovo
6hands in general are tough
in my search for the last 12 Master Quest episodes I have to deal with
!ew scalpers
10EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SCALPERS
also because I want legally pressed ones because those tend to last
the average lifespan of a DVD+R is calculated to be about 20 to 30 years and then they oxidize and cannot be read anymore
the legally pressed metalic DVDs can last 100 years or more

ignore that as the video is flagged as innappropriate for some reason

there seems to be lots of scalpers trying to unload Master Quest box sets on eBay

ugh, nintendo just couldn't leave it....code from more that a dozen of characters long.....
hate that in older Nintendo games
paswords from like +/-35 characters long X.X
12at the bright side
12with passwords that long
12yeah
for continuing on a level? no thanks
perhaps they needed to be that long to encode all the data?
Eon.
lol, dumb people need, not that that is a problem
the passwords generally store info about how you've done previously, how many lives etc. you have, as well as the level, so they can't be pre-defined short passwords
i mean for continuing a level, not for saving data
in the older games
for NES, SNES ETC.
and do these continues also start with the same number of lives, ammunition (if applicable), etc?
nope, only the level and standard supplies
if that's true then yes they are being silly but I suspect that it would want to hold on to things which would have to be in the password. Not even score?
not even the score

03though I love how I was there for like an hour and had the phone hooked up to Verizon's netbook and nobody that worked there cared

What kind of books do you usually look at?
10Borders is closing in the beginning of March, very disappointing..
I never go to a bookstore </mood ruiner>
/me read HML a book
10I read fantasy books and manga
Same
13same here
I read fantasy, manga, nature, and home improvement
I wonder how arti's doing. havent seen her on lately
/me reads Spell Books .-.
/me reads Wikipedia and internet articles
/me labels Ray as Harry Potter
XD
02XD
Last I heard, Arti removed the section of TST that mentions chat
the chatroom?
No, how to go on chat
13how come?
10The chat page is still up
10Or not
she hasn't used her FA for a year now
More then likely revamping it
13Don't tell me she is leaving
No
13!pokemon
13!floof
lol
...
No chat
lol, no more new people
Erm, I said she is more then likely revamping it
02waiit... is she gonna take down the tutorial page for mIRC? o3o
Thats what was taken down
13why is she taking it down?
02.-.
hmmm
To be more then likely revamping it
XD
is she ever on IRC anymore?
Not really
02nope
:(
she has work?
13revamping?
Yes
131!define revamping
13oh
10http://www.lugia.us/chat.htm
13Why does that script hate me
10Still there, just removed from menus
How can anyone find it then
/me shrugs
I hope she's just revamping it
/me sees Arti placing a bomb under chat
10Eh
10"Note: Because Lugia and I and so many of the founding chat members feel that this network has grown apart from the community's original values, you will no longer find us there.

13wow
Erm
13that why Arti is Awesome
13she cares about us
/me hopes that is sarcasm
^
13LOL
bbl
10I bet the fraction of people who actually are allowed to join that network is very few
Yeah
prolly
Anyone who was here originally o.o
I think
and/or friends
10That may also explain why #main was unregistered recently >>
13Sky.....
13#main has been unregister for a year now
13I forgot to telll everyone
10Well
10It was a secret channel for a while
WOOOO SUIJIN
I CAN SUMMON GATE GUARDIAN \o/
10after he left
ima own everyone
with this
:DD
13hes the one that left because he didn't feel that no one understand how he feels?
Yes, I think
/me np: Barbi Schiller - Misty's Song (Radio Edit) [03:57m/928kbps/44kHz]
13LOL Radio Edited
no long fadeout at the end
all the verses are there
13oh
13oh didn't he say that I was the only one that knew what he felt
13about pokemon
10Idk?
/me np: Backstreet Boys - As Long You Love Me [03:43m/128kbps/44kHz]
I am getting kind of burned out honestly
10Backstreet Boys, f yeah
in terms of Pokemon
these songs are being played on the air

10On the chat page
That's could look bad on the chat for new people
that*
10Most people are aware of Arti's hiatus
10Why do you think Aurora and Kyu were admin'd?
and whys that?
I see
It‚Äôs seems to me that she's been slowly tearing down TST to relive the so called good old days
Yes
10Pretty much
It's obvious she wants everyone newer than X years out
Unless they are tolerable

10500 | 9850
x.x;
Lol what
WB :3
again
What
the kill script for cursing
+G is set
People don't seem to understand something
so what is the point?
This site had always had a strict no swearing policy
dis place is mean to be :kid friendly:
Nice image :P
I apparently am the only person trying to keep this chau
setting +G filters that stuff otu
(out
Chat
@ your dA upload
At tst
sort of an FYI
I didn't reply when you posted it because I was away sorry :V
The swear kill will remain
its stupid
and un-necessary
Then leave
It remains
+G removes any word matching its dictionary for cursing
it prevents anyone from seeing the expletive
Those words, however, aren't used for more than swearing anyway
If you have the need to swear
Leave
The kill remains
Why not just a swear block and no kill? :E
I mean
03*WB02(Kosovo02)03WB* - <Kosovo> Oreos, floofburds, and killer octopi...what more can you ask for?
typoes happen
and I is next to O...
Kill remains
End of story
Kinda extreme, but whatever :V
If it was a mistake, you simply rejoin the chat
its too extreme
Its not hard
do you even know what +G does?
You just told me >>
no it's not hard
you don't seem to understand its function
it's just a little annoying |3
if you are so adamant about the over the top kill
mb, a kick instead? because i often have trouble reconnecting after a kill
let me get on my computer
because of unstable computers/dns pool/etc
You two are ticking me off
o.o;
/me wants to confess something as part of his babyfur self >.>
What the heck am I doing?
a kick sounds more fair
I'm not saying "remove the kill," I'm just saying a kill seems a little bit harsh. A kick doesn't o.o;
but first people should get along in here ._.
it is a bit too harsh
03*WB02(Aurora02)03WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
now that you've successfully dragged me on here
6the kill script remains
hey, Aurora.
plus what jun said about instability stands
11.‚Ä¢10¬´11WB10 (Espeon10) 11WB10¬ª11‚Ä¢. 10- WE FULLFILL EACHOTHER
03*WB02(Espeon02)03WB* - * Espeon humps Umbreon <Espeon> *bumps <Espeon> Ahjdahsdsad <Espeon> WTF
6it is harsh yes, but this site has remained with that kill ever since before I joined
the network has been highly unstable recently and its difficult or impossible to connect after a kill
6articuno specifically told me yesterday when I emailed her
6IT WILL REMAIN
because of DNS and routing issues
havent been on here much to see you in a while :3
6the day she ends this chat as a TST chat, will be the day I leave, and will be the day you lot have whatever you want
its not a good idea given the network instability
6until then, she wants the kill script kept in place
Wait what
6as of now, granted I probably missed it
6I haven't seen ocean go down once
6and am i correct in saying we now have the second server?
I have seen Ocean go down on a regular basis
6ok, then what of the second server
unable to connect
6>.>
64.32.1.34 ..?
/me checks his laptop
6otherwise, it's your own fault for swearing when I just explained we keep a non-swearing rule
what about when the network is unstable?
and it takes up to a few hours to reconnect after a kill?
6are you really going to die not being online for that time?
in order for this to work you have to have 100% stability of all servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year
summoned Suijin
its more like, 30mins or sth
two to go :3
for the kill to be acceptable
lol
yeah we have 2 servers for the silverings IRC right?
It's like the swearing kill is something new or something.
6 5. No foul language please, it has occured in the past where young people on the site have been kicked off by their parents after seeing just one innappropriate bit of text. This rule has always been in place so please respect it.
6this rule has ALWAYS been here lol
+G is enforcement enough for this
it prevents the offending text from being seen
<Aurora> are you really going to die not being online for that time? <-- Don't make fun of my addiction ;~;
/me flees
6IT SHOULD NOT BE SAID IN THE FIRST PLACE
i know it has always been there, but because of recent events, this issue has been highlighted.
6I JUST EXPLAINED THAT
6ffs
6if it's a typo, then I'm sorry
The solutions is simple
6but still
don't swear
:D
6the kill is here
6what espeon said lol
Thank you Espy
:3
this is not the only time that an old & previously accepted rule has been brought to attention because of a change of opinion. i have seen it happen elsewhere, too.
6ok well
6I'm sorry
6but until Arti declares otherwise
6this rule will remain
I mean, sure it's annoying to be killed and not being able to rejoin
but it's like swearing is something common. besides typos I have typed <censored > on purpose more than I've sweared lol
plus people are going to come up with workarounds for the kill script
6>.>
6i'm really not sure what you're NOT GETTING here
07Hey.
6but whatever
Well, that should be a 1 warn next ban kind of offense.
but
6I've already stated things
how about we ignore this
07Hm
6and yeah
I mean, myself I'm against censorship.
because this debate is retarded.
But if it's a rule
anyway AURORA FFFFFF
then it's a rule
10lolol #SW
Lololmorefail XD
I would be ok with this if the consequences did not result in a kill
I'm just dumbfounded why my unbeatable logic didn't end it all.
13LOL
6well
6too bad
6as i just said
6several times
13I just thought of something
Well, don't swear then. There's so many more creative ways to let out your rage~
That plush is <3
07besides, if there
13Congradulations you just been promoted to censorship. Call right now
07was no kill then the rule wouldnt be enforced as strictly
/me also punts Hitler :3
07if the mods arent there always
07orrr
07may be tempted to be more liberal
07just...
07yeah z.z
lul
07it's there for a reason
what about a kick?
07No.
6kill remains
07We can't count on people actually caring
07kill will remain as a reminder of stronger consequences for continued repeating offenses
07really
07just don't swear and you're good.
6as articuno said, I'm actually quoting this
6if you feel the need to swear, don't be on this chat
x.x
I am only here because I like some of the people on this channel and they ONLY show up here
6well
6then learn to listen to the rules
if I had a choice I would leave now
6as is life
Well, is it that hard just... ya know, don't swearing here?
07seriously
Not to be repeating myself but
07god LOL
really
and IDK what happens to my typing
I'm tired asdfgh
07I'd kick you just for that attitude if I were a mod and tell you to straighten the attitude
07I've been on the mod team, so yeah
07seriously
07No need to be all fussy about it
07and cause people distress, no?
SORRY GUYS I CAN'T SPEAK WITHOUT SWEARING OR I'LL DIE
/me flees
07cool to hang out with people you like but respect those providing the service
07it's the courteous thing to do.
<3
07seriously, come on.
6is truth for like 70% of people
As I've seen on another site.
6they just CAN'T
07Sigh ://
Being here is a priviledge, not a right.
Or something
and yeah Aurora
13I never sweared on chat
those are keyboard warriors lol
07well geez, people lol
/me never swears, unless it is a quote
<Aurora> is truth for like 70% of people

I WILL ALWAYS USE IT
Oh my god I did something useful :O
/me hides

In international versions of the game, Pok√©mon names are displayed with only one capital letter, rather than having all capital letters prior to Generation V.
FINALLY
Now it doesn't look like tey
*they're screaming the Pok√©mon's name
XD
03wait what
03I thought Diamond/Pearl had just one capital
Actually it didn't
it did
it did?
I don't recall
03I'm pretty sure it did
03hence INTERNATIONAL versions
My Typhlosion still has "TYPHLOSION"
03UI dunno LOL
03-U
03anyway sigh
lemme check
:V
03my router is being stupid
03disconnected me from Xbox Live
03i was busy playing Genesis games
13hey drfywefy
03and getting achievement points
Heya DRF
03I'm only here for a minute
genesis ftw
<3
03yeah ever heard of Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection>:?
nope
03it's an Xbox 360 game
drf
all caps
03I've hda it lying around
sorry :V
03but never bothered to do anything about it
03heh
03well real pros nickname their Charizard "Charizard" without all caps
hur
03so I dunno what the default had
CHARIZARD
03yeah i realize that
03whatever
03ffs
03why doesn't the shift key work when I want it to
:V
03not used to using my laptop LOL
I dunno
03but I wasn't gonna bring my whole desktop home just for a 1-week break
03so whatever
:P
In addition to this, Pok√©mon transferred from IV with their original all-caps name are converted to this format.
I wonder if that applies to nicknames
Hi Drake
03inb4 you try to transfer a Missingno and it borks
/me runs
03nah I know
04hi
03though
03there are actually "gen 4 missingnos"
03also known as invisible shiny Bulbasaurs
13I have the 6 pack Genesis Collection
yep
also whoa
03anyway
03dude
A reduction in boxes in the Pok√©mon storage system from 18 to 8, giving players the ability to store only 240 Pok√©mon, the same as Generation I. Additional space is available once the player has placed one captured Pok√©mon in each of the 8 boxes, then receiving an additional 8 boxes for storage, bringing the total to 16. This cycle continues until the player finally has 24 boxes, for a storage total of 720 Pok√©mon.
O.o
03ever heard of the Motorola Xoom tablet
720
03apparently it was just launched yhesterday
03-h
720 POKEMON SPACES
03I was playing with it at the Verizon store
x_x
03see
03stupid
also I saw it
03In Diamond
03I filled up 100% of my slots
Microsoft got sued LOL
03why can't they just have unlimited
03-_-
erm no
Motorola did
idk drf
03why do they still have a fricking limit
Space limits?
03I mean
03Pok√©mon Ranch doesn't have a limit
03you can dump all your Diamond/Pearl crap htere
03so eh
I mean you can't have unlimited data
there has to be some limit when the card has limited space
drf
Ranch DOES have a limit
but it's huuuuuuuuge
03yes but they could still hold like 80 million Pok√©mon in less than 1MB
Because the Wii's data storage > DPPtHGSSBW
actually, they couldn't
yeah
because that would mean more than ten pokemon per bit
/me cough
to my knowledge, a .pkm file is what, 1mb?
03no
03not even close
k
erm
03try about 7KB
...oh yeah XD
03anyway
03http://www.amazon.com/Sonic-Ultimate-Genesis-CO-Xbox-360/dp/B001G3AZS2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1298679612&sr=8-1
03that's what I've been playing
lemme open up a calculator
03and i'm going to go back downstairs soon to continue
1 mb is 1024 kb, right?
03yes.
5 MB for 720 pokemon
03still
but, they also have to try balance functionality of the system
035MB is tiny compared to the up to 256MB of storage on DS game carts
03they could easily have a huge number stored and be fine
03anyway
03I don't care
if they just let you store thousands willy-nilly, the system would become impossible to navigate
03my Diamond filled up x.x
03so basically like the GT
03S
/me hides
03anyway
around 146 pokemon per megabyte
so
yeah
03bbl I guess
k :<
osnap, new opponent!
03if LL comes on tell her I'm on Xbox Live
03but she prolly will check there first
03bye
Okay
Seeys
't understand complaining about "BAWW LIMITED SPACE"
You don't NEED to catch 'em all :E
But now you can... and more. You still don't need to though
:<
ahahaha this makes so much sense
When a Pok√©mon forgets a move in order to learn from a TM or HM, the move learned takes on the current PP of the move replaced by the new move. This is to prevent repeated usage of TMs and HMs for the purpose of PP restoration.
no really, I gave my Krookadile a TM for level ground (I think) and it ended up only giving half the max PP
I went wtf and went to a center; full PP
Rotom's other forms are now the type of their respective special move. <-- I dunno if this is good, bad, or... what o.o
/me spazz
It's always drug time
o-O

Hello.
wait what
mysterious who at night
Also I find utterly hilarious the people who mix up German pronunciation...
jerrah
Like the amateur play I saw, which contains the line "Nicht Schie√üen!" I'm sure as well as other instances of the word 'schie√üen.'
I don't speak German |D
Now, the actors playing the Germans were native anglophones. :P
6Brb.
lolwat
12you say hi to all of them but you don't say hi to me, umbreon D:
The play was supposed to be dramatic and serious. But honestly me and the other six people that speak German literally laughed out loud at "Nicht Schei√üen!"
you'd be Umbreon?! :DDDDDDDD
12yes
sorry, I didnt knew *tackleglomps*

I can't wait for B/W ;_;
Extralink <3
12o-O
10o-o
lol to be honest, i think Nintendo is making a bad business decision to release B/W before the 3DS
They kinda are :P
I wish that B/W would have at least 3DS support
like
actual 3D in the 3DS
12well it's not
That would probably change it from a bad business decision to a pretty good one (even though they'd be getting less money than they would if they made it 3DS exclusive)
yeah :<
its like the Pokemon Gold Silver release
it's not a bad business decision, it's a good one, because they can get lots of people to buy it before, then release a 3DS version after, and get even more money.
much like Crystal
that was Gameboy Color exclusive
where as Gold and Silver also worked on the Gameboy

7At who, Rora?
wait wtf
Why are you here again? o.o
you never come here
7On one of my WikiWalks , if that's at me.
Aurora, the chat link is no longer on the site
yep
"Note: Because Lugia and I and so many of the founding chat members feel that this network has grown apart from the community's original values, you will no longer find us there.
wait where is that?
If you are interested in talking to us or getting a feel for "original TST", let me know and I may consider inviting you into our private network. Please understand that I will NOT tolerate anyone who makes me or my friends feel uncomfortable there!"
10On the chat page
on the chat page that's been taken down
10which was removed from the menu
http://www.lugia.us/chat.htm
10as well as peas
yeah
7o_o
10Except http://www.lugia.us/peas.htm no longer exists
6peas exist o.o
12o-o
7Erm...
7Huh.
6go to misc.
He just felt like it..?
10Oh
Happy birthday. At least for me in the land of yesterday.
7Does it sound weird that it almost feels like Arti's abandoning this? O_o
She has
It's not the feel
She really has abandoned it
6I'll probably be next to go then
10The fact she created a private server, yes Quan
She abandoned it when she took the name WhiteTail
6I actually specifically said today that I'll be leaving when this chat is no longer tst
7Ah.
6so I probably wont be around much longer
7Well, that sorta stinks.
It does
7TST was my first IRC and one of the best communities I've joined.
It's changed so much from before the time when I was banned
7I'm speaking like I'm gonna leave already. O_o
It's no longer...what it used to be
the community was much different back then
Everyone speaks like it's dead already.
6lol
Kinda silly imo.
:3
It pretty much is
No you aren't, I am :3
7Well, it's dying as of now.
it's been dying for months
6well I dunno why everyone else is speaking of it
/me runs
6but me leaving is nothing new
6I've dropped my activity over the past 3 months
lol of course it isn't
6unless that went unnoticed lol
dropped from staff
10he left the IRC
yeah
10entirely
10except for his channel
xD
Yeah
7Hmm...
/me 7asks the cause of this moribundity.
10It's developed over time
6um
!define moribundity
What I don't get
-!- No results found
6k...
10and recent events have triggered perish
6define moribundity
!define moribund
-!- stagnant: not growing or changing; without force or vitality
6oh
6ok
7No, not exactly...
6 well
Is why you would choose to abandon this when it's no longer part of the site
6you wont be getting the answer to that
6only a few people know what triggered all of this
It's still the community
7moribund: A person who is near to dying; Approaching death; about to die; expiring; Almost obsolete, nearing an end
13Happy Birthday Espeon
7If we open up the chat more, then I'm sure it can be more assimilated.
13sorry
13Late
6wait, was that at me?
it's not Xeli's birthday
xD
read the topic lol
Yes
6basically
LOL
6I've only remained here for the past month or so strictly because of my responsibility to the chat
6I actually considered leaving long ago
OLO
:D
Well then, are you implying that you also don't like the chat?
6I actually don't-
6tbh
The chat makes up most of TST's community tbqh
6I have serious issues with this chat
10I don't think anyone does.
err
ANNIVERSAIRE*
As do most people
But we all stay here because we have things in common
.
wat
And we enjoy the company and chatter
6serious issues i tend to ignore for the most part, by remaining idle
7It's decomposed to scripts.
13oO_Oo
Indeed
6scripts?
taw
o_O
/me doesn't want anyone to leave
6ok well, i guess the kill script yeh
XD
7No?
6that was fin today >.>
6fun
6efdgrt
7All the other scripts.
6my point being
7The ones that emulate activity and socializing when there is none?
/me brbs and gets some ice
I admit the scripts would have been my fault
There's no one saying one has to socialize with everyone just because we're in the same userlist.
^
6well
13I don't know why people want to leave here. I only seen a few events that happened but that it
6my problem is just not getting along with some people in here
6which, if that was the only reaosn, I'd still stay
13that be me?
6a lot of things
7I find most of the people tolerable.
7Or neutral.
6today/yesterdays swear argument a good example
Well, ignore those people
What about the others?
6granted, it no longer matters since the chat is no longer tst
it probably isn't
6but BEFORE the removal of chat
13WHAT!
6rule number 5, this site is a strict no-swear zone
Well, I've said my opinion on that.
6as did I
6I also defended the rule
no holds barred = people trying to look like INTERNET GANGSTERS all the time
13no don't get rid of TST please
13or the chat
6but when even one of our mods didn't care about it
6I take serious issue to that
As have I.
6but now it's just a meh
http://i51.tinypic.com/2uejhmp.jpg
=s
see this, wat do
6since the rules are basically out the door
heh Xeli
7Hmm.
just kick the user in question then
12hi Espeon
I'm quite simply too polite to break rules unless they're incredibly unreasonable, lol.
Hi :3
7Perhaps we'll have to, if possible, bring TST's values back.
13this is all hitting me in the heart
13at once
or forcibly bring the rule down on them
you're an admin/mod
if people hate you for reinforcing the rules
then it's their fault
7o.o
13I can't handle this
And people might go AAAW POWER ABUSE but really, if someone breaks the rules
ban them
a week or so
lol?
not even kidding
You're only doing your job really
7And we've done so.
holy crap lag
7As the meme goes, haters gonna hate.
derp
The problem is obviously that some people never learn, yeah.
6if you manage to bring tst's values back
yeah
6you'd be a god
6literally
7O_o
Well
6I don't see this chat changing back
6ever
What do you think the values are?
7Note the lack of them in our topic.
How positive. And that's hypocrisy, I'm the one who says "I'm not negative, I'm just thinking realistically!"
6lolol
12 Hello, Infamous_Zed and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
I'm a hypocrite* What I meant.
:3
6course, I'm also running on a slight vent moment right now
xD
7o.o
13please everyone. Please lets try to at least fix this problem
6might be a tad more negative than I normally am
6anyways
Aurora, what do you think the values are?
13Lots of us can't bear to see this split up
Yeah
7'Love, friendship", that stuff?
It's been dying for several months now
12heh
6there's a serious amount of tension in here lololol
Well, the values are here, but there's more than just the values
there is
why wouldn't there be
when the entire fate of the chat hangs by a thread?
Well, I'm pretty sure that I'm not a problem.
And heh
10[21:16] <&Aurora> there's a serious amount of tension in here lololol <- Makes me think of the Cold War </random>
6espeon, lol
the chat isn't exactly being killed off, it's just being cut off from the main site.
7o-o
7o_o*
6points to you for being one of the most level headed people I've EVER met
7Yeah, but cutting off a limb will kill it from the original body.
but cutting it-
yeah
Quan said it
13how do we make it part of the site again
7Allow more people to access it?
I just go with the logical option, all day erryday
it was already quite far from being part of the site, really
xD
12silly kitty
6it was-
6so few people even knew we had a chat, tbh this isn't doing much
6a lot of this is just your guys' reactions to what some of us are doing lil
Yeah, but the people who did know?
6lol
6they can still connect
better to have a small chat with good people than to be spp
6it's not like we've torn down the chat entirely
LOL
ewwwwwwwwwww do not even MENTION SPP
XD
7But I prefer IRCs over other forms of online communication.
god no
well that is true, as long as one doesn't approach the realms of elitism.
._.
or maybe you do want 400 people to join
and then you will have to hire mods who act like jackasses
Lol that never works out

/me also yawns
brb
6ffff
6you made me yawn
:3
6stupid worrrrrrd
13back
I still got it~
12blah Espeon
12my chest is sore
12x-x
D:
12i've been starting to work out on this thing that is supposed to work your abs
13I love TST so much
12and it doesn't feel well XD
that reminds me of a pic but I can't even remember what was in it lol
13I don't want anything bad to happen to it
/me licks the kitty
12i'm not concerned
/me flops and lazies all over.
12i don't think anything bad can happen from this
7Whoops, RL got me distracted from here.
10Lol topic change and avoiding the problems at hand
7What'd I miss?
12this is why i've been a bit unattentive
A lot
a little bit of drama
6ok well lol
More like BRB/GTG-fest, Sky.
10k
12this is one of the few times
12you'll see me as the positive one
12i'm usually the pessimist
it'll take something far worse to cause the server to be removed
12better take screenshots
6tbh I think you guys will be fine
7I honestly would like to bring newbies here.
7Or more people in general.
6quan
6then advertise the channel or whatever
Newbies are cooldudes
Noobs, on the other hand...
6but we don't want to publically associate the channel with the forums anymore
6ANYWAYS
7Possibly, if Arti just left it.
7Ah?
7I dunno, an IRC would die as well if there's nothing tethering it to the microcosm of the community.
/me sighs
^
I wish the !tstposts script was still here
10The forums aren't much better than here
12believe what you want but this is still a community
Lol.
12TST liked or not
12*linked
10Yeah... community.
12in it's basic concept
12a community is a friendly group of people
12*its
13no matter what goes. TST and chat will be spiritually linked forever
10Friendly's definition has lost its lust, to say the least
7Eh, I feel as if half the people I was like, 'friends' with, aren't active.
10Yes
Yeah
12time will crush anything into dust
10My friends were the older members
or turn into people like me/
About to say that nothing lasts forever, lol.
10in which most left/drifted
leave for 3 years then mysteriously come back
13it does
Lol
7Hmm.
7Our leave rate is larger than our join rate, no?
10Absolutely
Sure
7So what does that imply?
12right now this isn't a bad thing
5000> members and less then 100 active by me guesses
10It implies... well, every decision we've made up until not
*mu
10Good and bad decisions
10now*
"6268 Total Members with 196 Active Members"
12it's like draining inpurities
12so what is left will be more pure
7o.o
/me dies
7So much as being the largest Lugia and bird community, eh?
10Half the people here aren't dedicated fans of Lugia/Articuno anyway
12there aren't many lugia and bird communities out there
10More than half, actually
13I'm sorry
12i don't think you have to worry about being the largest :P
I'm not a dedicated fan of anything.
its sort of a niche
... almost
7I joined for the community.
10I joined for Lugia originally, but my interest in that Pokemo faded
10Pokemon*
12same
What Skylands said pretty much.
I joined by random luck
Lugia -> Nothing -> ESPEON
yeah
/me pretends he doesn't hear that
12are you saying lugia is better than nothing
7o.o
12but nothing is better than espeon?
Nooooo
12hey
12it's okay if you think espeon is the greatest thing since sliced bread
And lol, I totally found the place by chance. I actually signed up and went somewhere like a minute later. If I left for that a bit earlier, I wouldn't be here.
It's kind of fascinating.
How little random events dictate so much~
7Hmm.
And good, now I know my thoughts are justified
7Tell that to WikiWalks. :P
What
inb4tl;dr
12i found the place through another lugia site
12i don't even think that site is still standing
10YT, for me
Ze Google for me.
Ze.. fanfics..
GOOGLE CONNECTING PEOPLE
7o.o
7I came here from:
7Lugia's Island, which came from Dragonfly Cave.
12did google release their OS yet?
10Quan, I've been wondering
10Were you a member of LI?
10At any point*
7Nope.avi
7Went on it when it was still alive.
and there it plays in my head
10It's not alive at all now
7And there we see a possible future.
Lugia's Island no longer exists
It was in a zombie state for quite a while though.
7The creator died. What does that mean for the community?
[13:25:06] <Espeon> Lol.
[13:25:33] <Skylands> Yeah... community.
I have to agree with that
I gotta say, haven't been many people with genuine
malicious intents here.
AS FAR AS I KNOW
WHich is very limited tbh
XD
7Heh.
and no, noobs or trolls who just learned about 4chan are not "genuinely malicious" =P
lmfao
;o
watch the new skyrim trailer now
no
my internet can barely even load google
7So...
7What to make of this?
lol?
I'm not sure what will happen next.
Going to make a topic on the forums
RUH ROH
and fyi if you think that's a bad idea I don't care.
Damnit
/me doesn't
You are missing gameplay footage that looks amazing :P
obviously Espeon would lol
Wait
you took me seriously
Have you forgotten everything I've told you
I wasn't ;p
10Be careful though, NS
"lol"
10We don't want to cause wide panic
10widespread*
that's my specialty
/me mauled
But okay
I'll see what I can do
Wow it's like there's a shark loose near a beach or something
"don't cause panic"
XD
Do it :D
It won't go anywhere.
10Anyway, hurry with that topic because I gtg soon
/me needs to wake up early to take her driving exam
Reminds me of how the first GTA IV trailer practically broke the internet for a while. UNINTENTIONAL DoS WHEE
;o
Poor whoever hosted it, poor them.
Lol.
/me wishes Sky the best of luck
I'm tired and all but for some reason it's always around this time stuff happens
so yay weekend
and good luck skyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
7Hope it goes well, Sky!
._.
7Well, communication is the first step.
10and Xeli
10(Didn't see your comment right away)
good luck
=p
7Who was it that said that history will be remembered by the silence of something something?
12hmm
o-O?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsJO7dmWT8
7MLK, it seems.
7Reassociation.
I will however agree that this trailer got some swag to it
yay
:>
7o.o
7Cool/
and in the process found out some stuff about .SSEQ files
I'm thinking of learning programming and writing a program to compose .SSEQ files that can loop in games
I need to get some programmers :V
/me runs
For some reason people tend to think I know more about such stuff than I really do :B
NO
Nope.
lol
!espeon
/me still belongs to Skylands for 15 more seconds
I'm just a guy with a black belt in the art of Google
3[6!6espeon vars 4reset3]
!espeon
Espeon; swag? o3o
/me 7blinks.
7Knowing that a traditional black belt only means you've mastered the basics?
Oh okay, so a black belt which is the highest grade in some martial arts (even though there's several "levels" within it) is mastering the basics? Makes sense.
13well good night everyone I'm going to Bed
I assume people got the point of my obviously not serious post
/me forcibly owns Espeon forever
mew
7Well, first-level black belt.
7I'm studying probability. :P
7*non sequitur*
lol.
I HAVE NO IDEA
where that came from
looks good pretyt much
12nothing wrong with that
I love the song mostly
...
and believe since the trailer killed a drake
We're screwed
<Espeon> I'm just a guy with a black belt in the art of Google
xD
Our Drake went to go hang himself
12you aren't a guy
12you're a kitty
Well, night everyone
12night
I know that a lot of people assume I'm a girl just because of Espeon, but I'm very much a guyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Nini c:
Night Bree :3
12heh
Yes, you're still a bree!
12eep
Kinda. I guess.
Fluffy
12hi foxy
!Espeon
D':
12o-O?
hi shenna
hi kosvvo
7Hmm...
7What does everyone else say about killing the game-like scripts?
Do it
10I say move them to #IRCGames
I can't really give input as I don't care :3
but if anything, move them to ircg-
even if that means deleting the OMGZ POINTS
Just take them out of SW, and join ircgames like Skylands said and Espeon tried to say
7Yep.
-,
Well, fyi I have a disable script active
7And the !username scripts?
7And the join/leave scripts?
!pokemon
7Well, just the join ones
blah
hang on
!pokemon
This script is disabled! Join #ircgames to use the script or ask a moderator to enable it!
yeah
!pokemon
This script is disabled! Join #ircgames to use the script or ask a moderator to enable it!
D;
!pokescram
Scrambled word is "ahvancra". To guess at what the word is type !pokeguess (Your guess here). Type !pokehint, !pokehint2 or !pokehint3 for a hint.
um
for that one too?
it's individual
oh
07!pokeguess carvhana
Sorry that isn't right! Keep trying!
You could make it notice the person instead maybe>
07!pokeguess carhvana
Sorry that isn't right! Keep trying!
!endscram
!endpokescram
Ended the current game. Word was "carvanha". Better luck next time.
!pokescram
07oh fish
k it should be disabled now
!pokescram
I screwed it up though
hang on
!pokescram
the join things get annoying after a while xD. And the username ones have died down lately, 1,1I'm unique again
XD
!pokescramble
...
!pokescram
...
oh great
Dead
deadbot :c
I'll fix it
let's see if VNC even loads

7Hmm.
Note that I didn't test anything lol
hur
bah
the music is so addicting
yeah she does. i'll see if i can get her to come on
/me goes to refill his cup of ice, with sadness
nikki's ship is being decomissioned and parked in the field of the fallen
use legal software!
Don't copy that floppy!
OH NO
Not another TG .x.
/me shot
xD
when you use legal software, you will get licensing errors that locks you out of your server until you connect a console
lol pfft
it died
that's why
:D
lmfao infinite loop
Blame iski XD
Or YT
remember, dont copy that floppy
I can't even use a copy
AND I'll COPY IT SINCE IT HAS MY PICTURES ON IT
dont copy that floppy!
or else they will come
I'll copy your floppy :(
and beat you down
/me wonders if n2 is TG in secret
top gear?
Since you sound a bit too much like him
No, another user
Who left here
/me jeremey clarkson!
/me Doctor Phil!
/me dies
and i dunno a TG
Off to get the metaphorical ice
i left 3 years ago then came back
/me cries

they can go to hell
because I don't give a crap

what I did
about a year ago
x.x
7Well, thanks for bringing the situation to TST's... front?
xD
7Naw, it's different.
well I'm not trying to annoy or offend anyone
just stating the truth
people need to know it
7This is creepily ironic. O_o
it is
as for the eleanor roosevelt quote
I couldn't find the one where
actions speak loudest or somethign
I won't be surprised if some people take t the wrong way.
But they awlways do
...
always
Xeli same
whatever
I made some notes not to act like a retard
but who knows
D;
/me dun like glares at him
$5 betting someone will lock/delete it
I have it saved
so I"ll just repost it
if they ban me then well
it'll only show they know it's the truth
mew
now I'm going bbl
:>
<
now I'm thinking I should have added more to that thread
meh w/e
7o.o
7You have a great argument, NS. :3
hm
i thought i turned off notify
well now i have
anyway hay guize
lets just hope no one takes it as a personal attack
10someone will, possibly
10"From what people have said, the core values of TST have 'disappeared'. Well, what do you think they are, then? If not friendship, respect and humour, then what?"
/me expects the admins to give an honest opinion on that
WHY DID WE ELECT OBAMA INSTEAD OF YOU
/me runs
7o.o
im confus, what's going on
sammy said she might come on after the decommissioning if she feels up to it
hm?
also hi Absol
i'm late to the party right
possibly
7You could say that.
but hi
damn
7But, ah, Sky: outside of you, Espy, Rora, and me?
cool idling bro
10I meant Arti and Aurora
10Dunno about Kyu
10he just... lurks
lol lurk
You're kinda right :|
hi
:>
10If you recall from earlier
10Aurora knew something
/me hugs Absol for no apparent reason :E
/me spontaneously conflagerates
10[21:07] <&Aurora> you wont be getting the answer to that
or worse
10[21:07] <&Aurora> only a few people know what triggered all of this
kies
/me spontanteously decomposes into dust.
pop?
/me run
hm
I could spontaneously quickfire..
also o3o
i misspelled spontaneously
oshi
k
o.o;
secrecy is bess policy
7My first thought to that statement was the site revamp.
heh
07o3o
7Hey, Kyu.
Kyu~
I need love :(
contents may have shifted in shipping; aka my mindset, between last i was really here and now
be warned
7Hmm, four mods lurking that thread. o3o
LUUUUURK
I don't think I really know what your mindset was beforehand so
/me sits all over Espeon
INSERT TONGS HERE
7Three.
yep
/me 7goes back to watching montages.
/me sits on Kyu sitting on Espyon
Espeon

She logged in as that name once
But she never told us expicitly
ohai Presea
I dunno.
All this stuff I guess
hi.
night espeon
right then
k
and yeah i wasn't exactly too conversational way back when
idle hero
/me squeakwiggles
i'm still in gg2, it takes up most of my time
i'm an influential member of a probably dying community, it's great
/me clicks the post button
10My response may have not been of much use, but eh
well, a community that is most likely dying
xD
10Also, I edited your first post, NS
7o.o
10Adding a note not to lock/delete/move the topic
now afk again
Skylands I did that
"To anyone who is offended, this is simply the truth. Do not go "BAWWWWWWWWWWWW YOU" if you do not like it. Also, anyone who decides to lock or delete this topic is simply denying reality. Don't be an idiot."
10where?
10well
10I added another one
10because people tend to forget after reading long paragraphs
o-o
k
10Bleh
10I wish I could change #SW's topic
Annoy Kyu.
lmfao
Works wonders
c:

10!espeon
/me now belongs to Skylands for 20 minutes
10[23:01] <&Kyu> but at the same time I'm gonna move it to community
10...
10Ascedant won't be able to view it then
10Nor will whoever else that already knows about this
10and I'm sure they want to give their input too
10ffs
10Espeon help me out
07well bah lol
10I think after the whole thing is over, then we can move it :P
10also where is Alt lol
hi Things!
In community it will just be filled with negativity by the "original members" lol
THINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10say that in #SW :P
I think this is something more than rcm's should be able to see.
But what does my opinion mean.
:3
10D:
02I agree with Skylands
If isolated it will just be overfilled with negativity from people who are already determined to leave.
:D
10^
so hm
what exactly is going on there
10Absol, read it
10[23:01] <&Kyu> but at the same time I'm gonna move it to community
I want to know too D:
10whoops pasted wrong thing

10I just want current members to be aware of
10anyway, gtg goodnight
i'm reading it anyway
i guess if i;m going to actually come back it pertains
to some extent
i'm basically the guy that lurks and never participates in shit but eh
ok bbl it's time for the decomissioning of nikki's ship hms prince adrian
hm
awards
yay
systems i hate
7o3o
7Nice wording in that post, Espy.
i'm commenting on something i noticed while i was on the forums, an awards system
all of the awards look like petty bullshit that i'd equate to achievements
I kinda felt like saying "This is a site with a community, not a personal chatroom" but I kinda have a feeling that wouldn't be recieved too well.
YAY MOTIVATION FOR SPAM
basically
or lurk
Just another example of good in theory, not in practice.
it reminds me of this clan in gg2
everyone hated it
and everyone in it was dubm or just in it for shits and giggles
it had achievements
well
"awards"
or badges or something like that
the clan was army-themed
i just noticed the clan topic still exists
o.o
last post was in august
/me throws his 3 cents in
/me takes back a penny
Wow Kyu, your post is like, amazing.
07oops.
IT FEELS LIKE I KINDA WROTE IT IN A LESS TIRED STATE
meh i'm rambling
I wouldn't call the place dying, it's more of a case of the regulars being less and less open to new people
07well
Q
F
T
07MAYBE I AM YOU.
ohmai
07o.o!!
Leave army-themed clans for clans for FPS's
I wouldn't mind :3cccccccccccccccccccc
:p
mysteries
AND MAYBE I AM KYU
EXCEPT NOT
+=23.16.25=+ <Espeon> I wouldn't call the place dying, it's more of a case of the regulars being less and less open to new people
sounds like gg2
only more dick jokes
07ZOMG
Fun
7o.o
07ALSO WHO ARE YOU
07XD
I AM THE GUY NOBODY NOTICES
07MMKAY
OHAI

HELLO CANADA.

so he's Canada
whoever that is
lol
07who?
/nick Doctor
/me runs
and Kyu, moving it to community would defeat the purpose of it
^
ah
It should be a thing everyone can have an opinion on
that and its hard to keep track of people when, you know, they can change their nick AT WILL
hehe
that's an old change
get with the times
there's chat now
I know
lopl
but the nick changing is annoying
never know who anyone is
chat that i don't participate in
same :|
aliasing is fun
07meh
07I guess
and Absol
2bleh :\
i rememeber
look at Skyrim trailer o3o
remember*
ohai BL oxo
back in the day
2hiya LL, hiya everyone
chat was accomplished through name changes
skyrim trailer?
07but at the same time I don't really like a public post that basically says 'oh this place isn't good anymore'
07.-.
Heya LL and wb ;o
DOCTOR WHO ;o
*BL
oh\hi LL & BL
& HML
also to be honest i have no idea how hard 2.3 is going to affect the players
Well, if people take it that way they obviously haven't read the thread
yeah they're working on 2.3 and it's pretty good at the moment
but anyway
Heya DRF
so i wonder
how many people are going to quit?
/me is getting beaten at L4D2 as usual x.x
hey drf
this is the kind of thing i should be talking about in the gg2 forums
berb
[15:22:40] <Kyu> but at the same time I don't really like a public post that basically says 'oh this place isn't good anymore'
and my stupid home connection is lagging like frick
Also Kyu
OK what is going on here
add the topic to the chat topic please?
Well.. quite a lot now
2hey DRF

drf
well my state is Michigan
/me hides
LOL
http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6744.0
haha
as for the chat not being linked to the site
that was my idea
because of all the stupid trolls
...
lol
7o_o
7Really, now?
yes
Of all people
7What trolls?
"all the stupid trolls"
As in plural
what
noobs =/= trolls
because at that time we had quite a few random mib_guests come on and be stupid
Absol; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbsJO7dmWT8
7And you call that trolling?
07well
being stupid != troll
quany
you remember that
:/
when you went in #brawl to avoid them
don't you?
07I still say that it should go back onto the site
7Yes, yes, I remember that.
2i have friends on Whirled who are trollers
7But compared to total seclusion?
03iffikkxgxthg
busy
03rapey
typing shit in gg2 about 2.3 update
is there seriously anyone on TST that doesn't know that the IRC is irc.lugia.us?
You'd be surprised.
7Do they know how IRCs work?
Yes
I don't know
ew noobs who can't even type in a simple server >_>
07but everyone was once at that point
/me 7points at herself.
07i.e, nearly everyone here
oh right drf totally knew how irc worked even before knowing what it was. That's totally natural
/me flop
I learned from a tutorial
using mIRC
07you're exhibiting the very point of what I posted drf, lol
not this one click webchat crap
beb
Yeah
you learned
see?
*brb
everyone has to learn.
2POPCORN IS DANGEROUS, DO NOT EAT D:
And what Kyu said
I learned how to type in the server myself >_>
I used mibbit for quite a while XD
I wouldn't call the place dying, it's more of a case of the regulars being less and less open to new people
BRB
THAT QUOTED 2TM
erryday
07lol
7Hmm.
so 2.3 will have no chat at all?
07you're not a rapper D:
yeah
as far as i know
thats lame
because chat is a component of vinmod
7Raagh, I'd hate to leave now, but it's close to midnight.
7also
7Au revoir.
7!espeon
/me now belongs to Kyu for 7 minutes
7Oh, joy.
Seeyas Quanny
7See ya, ev'ryone.
i personally like the fact that chat is going away
i say the only useful thing about vinmod is the server features, namely class limits
12o-O
12!kyu
/me 7does a barrel roll! ._.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†|:¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†.-.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†:|¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†._.
which i'm not exactly enthralled about that sort of thing going away
12hi Quilava
hi Umbreon
12:)
/me snugs
~
/me squeaks and hugs back "whats up?"
12not much :/
also Absol, what server do you play on?
ooh.
bai Quan hai Roara
12i got free chinese food from the panda express today
Quilava, depends on what's online
ah.
and free food is always nice
Espeon you're on hecka late lol
....speaking of which, brb
Also
12one of the employees there has known me since i was a little kid
I just got an email from someone
I know, I'm like tired but at the same time not.
From the tst inquiry
o.o
12she heard of the bad news and talked with her boss and insisted that the food i got be free
Someone found a giant lugia plush
For 10 bucks
Was asking if it was legit
The description matched
Why hello Aurora :3
Thrift stores are amazing
and brb
Im way jealous though
the bad news?
well that's.. kinda cool
if you don't mind me inquiring, I have no idea what the bad news is
03hi strange beings.
12my mother died 2 weeks ago.
oh
Now i feel like an ass
12why
:o
Because people usually feel bad when a really bad thing happened and your being oblivious to it
eh back for a minute but still
you usually feel down
I'll continue this discussion when I'm back on my computer
12you probably weren't told until just now
Eh?
12nothing wrong with that
people going all "zomfg TST is dying"
Yeah
Absol, you on right now?
Sorry bout that, didn't mean to cause a panic lol
not gg2 the game no
i'm on the forums
it's not really dying so much as there's a change in members
right? LOL
oh, ok
12-o
Its not dying, its just different
12o-o
it's always been changing.
No one caused a panic, and people who say it is dying is a bit negative I'd say. Especially those acting as if it is dead xD
07it's not really a change in member
And yeah, people coming and going
07s
07I say it's a change in the people who are regulars
That yeah
12heh
07everyone here is being so whiny and intolerant as of late
I think I'll play a little
12not me
12am i?
03lateearly
07like that whole disabling of game scripts just a couple hours ago
12i've been a bit mopey yeah but yeah
...the heck?
Who did that?
I haven't been any different than ever sooo

Sad...
12the employee at the panda express gave me free food today
Sorry about your mom dying
12because she knew me since i was a kid and heard the news
12talked to her boss in chinese then said her boss said it was alright if i didn't pay for the meal
12i said no then they both insisted upon it x-x
12hi
03LOL
03I would be like "free meal? Sweet"
12i figured
12:P
also, drf, the new versions of VRD4
12mr. "i used a coupon twice despite the fact it said one per person"
03I was full and never bothered going back a second time XD
12oh lol
if i do a WAVdump from TS, its out of sync by several seconds
12funny how you said that food made you cry in pain
12that stuff is nothing
also japanese AAC in TS is broken.
12sure the tai peppers are a bit of a bother but they are still nothing if you know how to eat them right
03LOL
03well I just don't like spicy food in general
12lol
03I also find it funny how they call Orange Chicken spicy
03that stuff is like the most tame thing they have
03which is why it's my favorite
03well
12then again a friend did say i eat so much spicy food that my mouth is probably just numb
03recently I've gotten sick of it XD
o_O
03I started getting addicted to Sweet Fire Chicken
12orange chicken does have a mild zest to it
12but it's a really mild zest
mfw TST has a "secret club"

03I don't like beef and I don't like broccoli
03therefore I've never ordered that.
12broccoli is good for you

Seriously, I don't even get why that's a bad thing. It's not like I'm gonna go around svsnick'ing people and banning people or anything..."
Someone seriously said that?
03Yeah
03Aurora did
03at one point
what the <censored>
03she said something about how TST is differnet now because there's no more Nest
03I'm like
03it's just a server
wat
03what's the big deal
03honestly
wat
WAT
>mfw
what
LO
03if anything someone who's *actually here* managing 1/2 the server is a good thing
03since Arti would just leave to go on vacation and Nest would die 27.5 times, you know?
YOUTUBE is lagging from the song ;P
yeah Altair XD
sdjkhasfjkasdf
kf
drf*
wtf
03...LL
03*LOL
I'm too used to typing Altair
03how did you manage to typo drf as Altair
since I spam his nick in PM
03I mean what
about 24/7
03oh o.o
yeah
03Altair is actually an engineering company here
so I spam him
03I applied for a job there
lmfao
03Altair Engineering
03www.altair.com
03;P
XD
hahahaha
Get altair to work there
XD
03I'm dead serious though
03their headquarters is like 10 minutes from my house
lmfao
yeah that...it would die
I love having this song on 1/2 speed using HTML 5
nini :<
03I mean, if my server dies, it's not like I could actually fix it, but I could at least try to
03and deloop it if needed
03speaking of which
03I wonder if arti can give me control of the round-robin :/
Original text:			
360p < Epic fail
03also hm
because the scramble scripts cause the client to kaboom
drf
she'd have to give you control of the site then...
03it's supposed to be 220, not 224
03but whtaever
I had to guess a constant BPM.
03OK
03well
03honestly
07round robin?
but yeah, i was close :>
03I've gotten used to yours being too fast LOL
03Kyu
03the round robin si basically
rounb robin dNS
irc.lugia.us
03when someone types irc.lugia.us
03where it directs
03for example
nest or ocean
03if ocean is dead
(DNS pool)
directs to 2 IPs
03and we know it won't be back for a while
03we could just take it off
03so people who type irc.lugia.us would only connect to island
03and vice versa
03and good IRC admins keep control over that
holy crap
03I don't even think Articuno ever touched that once after setting it up LOL
dkahdfksd
sorry
holy crap
Server:		192.168.0.1
Address:	192.168.0.1#53
** server can't find irc.lugia.us: NXDOMAIN
the IRC domain was deleted
03...
03LOL
03honestly
03it's not TST that's changed
03it's Articuno
03:/
I can agree with that
03her new job must have gotten the best of her :(
>:
Yes
yeah, she change
;(
03I mean she used to be totally cool with everything
03now she's all "I'm gonna leave and go hang out iwth my own friends"
yeah..
03I'm like
03yes certain people here annoy me to no end
03but am I going to leave because of that?
oh?
03no
mmhmm
/me sighs

03I don't have any spare monitors
03just the tower

03that's because
laaaaaaaaag
03whenever someone in my family gets a new computer
03they just keep their monitor
the number of times I've raged at him and Starlit
03I mean, why shouldn't they
03I know right
03Starlit too
03though
03at least with her
03sometimes she can be alright
03it's like 50/50 with her
Starlit is not too bad
when they're together
03yeah
it's horrible
I swear
03god help us all
every time they're together
I end up raging in their face
03to quote Rorschach from watchmen'
03same
and then Aurora goes like "stop being a jerk"
03hey
03people call me a jerk at times too
03I'm just not afraid to call a spade a spade, you know?
i'm more of a jerk than you though XD
03if someone's being a spammer I'm darn well going to call them out as suc
and same
03h

03so you just opened the MIDI in Garage Band and it played it fine?
yep, i made a few settings & instrument changes
i set maximum instruments to 64.
& i changed it from "flute" to "boldt Andre Grand Piano", and volume fixes so it didn't clip.
"CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES ARE REPORTED TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES!"
lmfao
that's on your shell's motd drf
03>local authorities
03hm, but it can't be exported back as midi?
through logic express
anyway, you can use any midi seqiencer to combine 16-track to say, 4-track or something, right?
"I shall report it to the sydney police since they're my local authorities!"
03um
03I have no idea
03I just take MIDIs and open them
if you do one, note events may overlap and conflict with each other.
03and for editing I just open them
"They'll do something about some random person in Michigan!"
03I don't do synthesizing stuff
that was what happened with owenp.
owen16 i did not combine tracks.
owen
>bbl
un owen was her
yeah
And then there were none

at this time doing one of the few night transmissions on the AM broadcast band using the former basket case transmitter
although given this experiment I could easly change the song from AM Radio to AM Stereo and have it focus on the 1980s rather than the 1970s
gosh I bet the people at Motorola will be upset
I‚Äôve been really enjoying the new B&W Pokemon episodes
So much better then the other new episodes
EWW B&W
lol
I do understand why some don‚Äôt like it
Though I love it

03off to bed
seeya

Finally
My Pok√©mon BW Interface Windows sound scheme is near-complete
Just need sounds for logon and logoff
But I don't care about those much
6lol
I wonder if I should have a sound for Menu Command though
a.k.a. make a sound when you click on a menu command
I used the sound when you click on a menu item in Pok√©mon BW
But it seems to get anniying fast
I guess I will try this for a bit
if it gets annoying I will disable those

...wow, just wow.
what?
Aurora DARES to mention the bleurghr SH*T?
Just say it
<censored>
/me lols
xD
bloody hell
they DARE to mention it?
It's Roara
What had you expect
Drake
I am slightly fuming
The spam that I protested against and of which caused my ban in the first place
Oh
I admit I was wrong in the way that I did protest
I see
But I still haven't let go of the fact that they SHOULDN'T have spammed the crap out of the main channel
They can have fun, but no one else does
I don't see why they don't go to #ircgames |D
*
Erm, typo mess
#ircgames didn't exist back then
but the point still stands
Oh
they can join another channel to do crap
no one gives a crap about their "fun"
lol, yeah
and yeah, I'll stop venting now
I still hold a grudge against that event I guess
04Why NS?
04*late*
from Aurora
"My reasons for seeing the difference are very similar to what Kyu said. I can take several examples, should we go back to the bleurugherhgh event? There are a couple people in chat who find it necessary to crush most of that randomness into the dirt. A lot of us actually have fun with that. Half the reason arti split away is because of that I'm sure. I personally miss seeing her in there everyday, and it eventually turning into a swdgknj
drgekrdg fit for a few minutes. TST was fun back then. Take a look at the old peas for example. Half of the really funny ones, the ones you can TELL people are having fun, were from stupid stuff like that. It's so much more serious now, to the point I really just hate being there. It's one thing to get irritated for one person posting nonsense stuff on their own (granted, I've done this, I know I have, and I stop when people ask me to)...
.but when like 5 of us are having fun, yeah."
the blergrgrh shit
still makes me rage

anyone who dares to bring that SHIT up in that topic
I will kill

I understand why though
04As I said to Roara
04Try not to incite personal conflicts due to past actions and focus on the matter at hand
well
maybe

I just realised
that Articuno doesn't have herself as an admin anymore...
she's only in technicians...
mmm cat
wow, so that list shows who work on the site, am i right?
it's the staff page
just like any other staff page
so yes
it does
that is sooo many!
Lol.
i'm the only on who is working on my dad his site, with my dad of course
like being the only admin is boring
lol
but it's fun to do
right?
depends on what you need to do
if you need to deal with annoying retards then no, it's not fun
otherwise it's usually okay
uhmm, it's not like a forum, but as a site for my dad's company
thats way diffirent and harder than a (simple) forum site
>assuming that I'm an idiot
I know what you mean
I was kidding before and being sarcastic but that's not hard
not if you do that for a longer time
considering that I enjoy helping others and programming I don't mind it
lol
meh, i'm still learning how to program
ITTL?
but thats how we call it over here, alot of differences
but it all comes down on the same thing anyway
Ah

10and their opinions
/me could also name a few people who she believes deserves such on the top up her head

6LUCKY D:
02If you've got a Wii and Nintendo Channel, you can get the demo too
Well there..
Oh Okamiden :D
And Arti posted
7*F5*
02Methinks Roara went to check it out
6methinks I will
7I still lurk. X.x
02It's not very long and basically just teaches the very basics of the game
6teaches basics...
6is it the same as okami? or new gameplay?
02Things are a bit different, like how the kid who's on you*hope this isn't spoilers* has a life bar when he gets off, and you control him more, like with Issun.
6yeah I knew that lol
02Otherwise it was general stuff, how to bloom, power slash, and fight monsters
6but hmm
^^
e.e.e whats new?
7'we just find it annoying and he finds it annoying that we get annoyed at him being annoying -v-' <-- Well.
e.e.**
just being sleepy
/me enjoyed Arti's post </sarcasm>
Whaa
Weird line
10Now I feel worse than ever before on what I did

well you did wake up at like 9 a,

Oh joy..
/me wonders if.. nah
mhm
/me debates on whether or not to post
02I probably won't post
7If you think it'd help or hinder this dilemma.
10I was gonna say if Arti doesn't want to work alongside be, then be so
10I don't work on this chat anyways, I never did
02I fear that if I say anything, I'll get ridiculed
10I'm a forum mod for god's sake
10Why she avoids here, who knows
10I idle most of the time
7We're all tense about each other's opinions, are we?
/me planned on saying something along those lines in her post
02No, I have that fear when I post anything on any forum thread
soooooo
No need to. If someone ridicules you, they are totaly idiots in this case.
02Yes, maybe in this case
7We're not gonna get off this case unanimously, it seems.
02But heck, what would I say?
7Well, you're a member of the community.
02Really?
7Would you isolate yourself?
6this whole thing is ablah
02Already done for me it feels, lol
hi Shiny
:3
7Well, there's the problem.
7@ Shiny.
What, me? D:
Okay XD
02Hmm?
7I had a feeling you'd say something about that.
7So you feel you've been isolated by the... chat? Community?
6I don't even know why i'm posting
02Most likely both?
6whatever though
7What's keeping you here?
/me posted :/
02Two people, won't say their names though
7Okay.
7Not the entire scope of this community, eh?
02Nope
7Ah, the question I'd like to ask next would be rather... harsh, to an extent.
NEGATIVITY OVERLOAD UPRISING
7o.o
6lol
You should play Allods Online with me
7I dunno about that, Espy.
And everyone's "harsh" by normal standards right now. It's what's needed right now.
It's free :3
6read that as overlord
7O_o
10Tbh Espeon, I expected as much
02That's fine then
People have to say what they mean
hmm
linux too?
7Okay, so the question, then:
6up until now, a lot of people have restricted their opnions
6now it's unbarred, everyone for themselves
is it java based?
6which, tbh, is yeah needed
or flash based?
No :( I had to dual boot Windows
7Would you leave TST?
10@ who?
02Me
well, my comp cant even handle flash
7Shiny.
so, i think ill stick to not playing it
;)
otherwise, you know i would
02I'd say I already mainly seperated myself from the forums, I come back now and then, mainly to force myself to be active again.
02Would I leave TST? No, I had too many good memories to leave
6wow guys
02Oh I'm still on the topic lol
7I've kept a window open for it since it started.
7But anywhoo: well, I've quit cold turkey at other sites where I've felt I had to force myself to get on--not TST yet, but yeah.
7It's rather alleviating.
02I've done that to many sites, now and then I'll get back on just to see what's happening, but I don't care anymore
It's a fun game! It's like what WoW would be if WoW was actually fun to play and didn't have trolls
eh wait
7Hmm.
oh
7Well, I can't really correlate to that extent.
It's like what would happen if Oblivion and Pixie Hollow were merged together
6I'll talk to you in other channel
No I know about the topic
but I was wnderong why i was nick laerter
6oh
6laerter lol
02Good going Roara your teasing chased her off
7o.o
7I'm assuming we're lightening this mood?
i guess
6lol
6she had to go
02Just my nature to do so
6but she left before I asked where she was going
6it's a bbl
02Oh is that your excuse :U
/me squeaks
6yes
huh
02I bet you hid her in your floof
6mehbeh
02Hey Quil
hi
02wb Seas
Thank you
/me 7floofs a random person.
;oo
;l
7Ye gads, remixes are earworm-y.
02I'm still reading this topic
02Yet it feels like everything is encoded and I have no clue what's going on
7Well, that's not too enigmatic.
10Probably what most forum-goers are thinking @ Shiny
02I just hate being clueless tbh lol
Secrets.. kinda
/me comes back with ringing ears
02But I also think the topic is getting away from what was originally intended. But that's just a thought, could be wrong
02Oh yes
/me should probably get back to drawing
7Sure.
/me lols at quan
/me o3o
arg!
rofl
02Tornado siren

/me sits on Shiny's head
02Yo
02Hiya :3
7Hmm, Rora?
hiya HML
7Do you have any suggestions on drawing distorted reflected objects?
7No, not reflected--refracted.
02Like something in the water?
a scar?
my scar
Heya LU .c.
7Yes, or in my specific instance, off a person's glasses.
02When I start thinking of that, all my suggestions are too bloody and depressing XD
7o_o
/me won't even suggest
7Okay.
6lol distortion
6I hated drawing distortion
6um
6I don't even know how to explain it lol
7So...
6ok
6um
/me farts
6convex surfaces
6extend/stretch the reflection
6concave contract/squish it
6make enough of a concave, it reverses itself (like a spoon
7Okay.
02lol
6glasses tend to be convex, very very slightly
6so an object say, on the left side of the reflection
6just stretch it towards the right abut
6a bit
6egrhtyg
/me yawns
7Hmm...
7I'll think about how to do that.

6DGF
6TOUOHU
6fg
6TOUHOU
02It was for my class, but
02I actually read ahead of the assignments lolol
6you read it for your CLASS?
6I wish my class was that awesome
02Aye
02It was...English 9
6LUCKY LOL
7o.o
02For years I could practically recite the whole poem
7O_o
8000 | 8000
7Dyah.
02And then one year I was watching some super hero show, and the bad guy was reciting the poem in his own way. I found that mildly creepy, yet super funny
6lol
:(
6the ending totally...I wasn't expecting it
02You cannot burn mah floof
6I mean, suspicions
6but yeh
02I wasn't either
6I was like asdwaefsbjkekgr when I read it
6my stepmom looked at me like i was stupid
it's firefloof
But I just did with Dragon fire D:
6cuz I was so quiet all day
pff
firefloof
6until then
02Our teacher ripped out the last page of the book telling us who the killer was
02So I was probably put on suspence for about 2 weeks(even though it was easy to figure out who it was without the last page)
02<3
But there can only be one
and there's 3
02No, there's always more than one
02And wtf
Now there's 2
6yeah I knew it on the second page of that letter
8500 | 7200
02I'm not on the bouncer, so I have no idea why my other one keeps coming up
before i even attack
and then Espeon is the floof pimp XD
02But even if we knew we couldn't say to those who didn't or we'd be docked a letter grade. Which was fine, people don't want spoilers, but I remember talking to my friend and we were trying to figure out who would die
LOLwut
02And who was the killer, and some girl listens halfway in and thought that we totally spoiled the ending for her, so we got told on.
/me sprawls out on Espeon
6lol
6anyways
6I loved that book
02XD
02Yes
02Good book, wanted to read more books like that
6I bought it, admittedly, because "There Will Be None" is the name of a spell card in touhou
6yes, based on that book
6plus, the song is named U.N. Owen Was Her?
/me is an Espeon bed or something.
6so yeah
6HAD TO BUY
6but I also heard nothing but good out of it
6so why not

O.o
6this video is so ausing lol
02Hmm?
10As Quan already mentioned, we need to formulate ideas now
:D
10Enough flaming each other
Epic video :D
6tbh I think a lot of people missed the point of comments being directed at people
6since a lot of that included what's causing the issues at hand
02Aye
10Well, Arti PMed me about one of my questions
10Our conversation ended with she wants us to fix this
6um
6duh
/me feeds cat to her firebreathing cherry tree
6we talk about that on a daily basis
6her and i
10.
6well
6the fixing part
6realized that probably sounded like we were talking about something else
10and I'm not seeing any fixing yet
02It can be hard to fix a problem
6mainly because she's gone and i don't have the patience here anymore
02That you have no idea how to fix
6and you're basically-
6yeh
6you sound liek you're blaming me for it
6like I'M the one who's supposed to fix it
10No
/me tosses where somewhere :p
hi where
Firstly, no one has been flaming anyone.
6^
02I believe it's the community's job, not just to rely on the mods/admins when things go bad
And secondly, yay for going back to the actual topic.
6comments directed at certain people were actually informative
/me catches him <3
And thirdly, Shiny everything you've said has been right today c:
6dunno how to describe that without it sounding like we're supposed to enjoy this
6but
6yeh
6esfdgrf
02:3
:o
/me catches fire
Really, if anyone gets offended by any post in that thread they are stupid and ignorant xD
And :3 indeed
/me waits for Cat to be perfectly cooked
6lol
10I used "flame" for the lack of better word at the time
And I'm only talking about the parts of it that I know anything about btw <<
/me can't think straight right now
My knowledge is limited on certain things and I'll just refrain from commenting on them.
the pms didn't work so i called him
/me huggles Sky
6the way I see it, everyone's going to have to take part in it
Well obviously
it's a community "challenge" if anything
6I care enough about this place that I don't want to leave with it on a negative side, I'd like to see it have something build off of before leaving
6otherwise, I would have been gone yesterday
i wanna make a tree that beats stuff up
back
i've seen the movie that's on but it's still good

Something in that nature but wevs

03@ Feraligatr
6meganium's old concept though

They ruined Cyndaquil
7How many pokemon fans you think know of these old concepts?
6since that's the one they used in the games
03since that was an OLD picture
I mean in that pic XD
03that's what I'm saying
The betaquil is beh'

6trust me, I know
6I was gone from TST for like
6a month
13Persona 3 LOL
6playing twilight princess
6LOL
13I'm over 50 hours into it and it's apparently 70+ hours long
13then there's another chapter of the game to do after that
6o_o
13which is another 30+ hours
13so |D
/me sleeps in Shiny's hug
6O_o
13I loooove long games xD
13It's made me cry a few times too :B
6what is it about?
02:3
o.o
/me will always be there c:
o.o
13Lol, that's one question I always have difficulty answering |D
02Even more :3
6lol
13It's basically about a group of high-schoolers who have to fight Shadows during the Dark Hour (a hidden time that separates one day from the next) in order to save people in the area who are falling to a mysterious illness known as Apathy Syndrome
13buuut that's a very vague description |D
Niice
XD
So, is Persona 3 where they shoot themselves with those "Invoker" things?
02What sistem is it for?
02Nvm
02do not answer lol
Probably PSdouble.
02system*
02PS2
13Evokers, and yes they do "shoot" themselves xD
13I personally think it's awesome
Ah okay LOL. Then I've heard of it xD

13Can't remember if I've linked that before or not, but yeah |D
O.o
02hi
I'll either call that cutscene either amazingly awesome and epic, or as downright freaky as the entire movie of Princess Mononoke
13LOL, I've yet to see that movie
6awesome movie, it is
6this movie you linked....wow
6what did i just watch LOL
6curiously awesome
Yes <3
You just watched awesomeness
And as much as I don't really like animeish videos
I though it was epicellent!
OOh
It's on the PS2 :D
Yes
13Yeah, hence why the game was practically impossible to find in shops, along with Persona 4 xD
13Yay for ebay~
6so wait
6these people shoot themselves
6and it summons that....what is that
And... they die..
A monster o.o
AE, explain nao
13They don't literally shoot themselves, it's not an actual gun :3
13and what he summoned was a persona
13the evokers are needed to bring out the persona that's inside them
6ah
6ok
6making sense
6thats awesome
6:>
/me weegles
13The minute I started playing, I could instantly tell it was so much darker than Persona 4 xD
13made me feel all tense even though not much was happening in the opening cutscene
13well, until the second half at least :B
02Maybe I can find a LP of it
12breadsticks!
02but it looks like an RPG, which gets boring
02Cheeseon!
13It's an RPG, but the game focuses heavily on storyline and plot :3
02I love those games
02But there also has to be good gameplay or I'll get gamerage before I even make it to the next plot point
/me may as well leave
12yep
Hia Bree ^^
12how goes
Good :3
You?
12i'll live
6ok guys
6it's true
6unless the next batch of images proves otherwise
6but
6I've been looking at this
6http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6745.0
6look at the luck this person has
10She could've just bought the plush somewhere online and pretended it came from a thrift store, but I trust her words :P
6I trust those words oddly enough
Same
6I mean, yeah, no proof otherwise
6but
6she emailed me before she bought it asking if I could confirm it
6again, no proof
6but yeah
6why would you make that up LOL
10Other than gloating purposes, dunno
6I'd be like LOOOOOOOK WHAT I FOUND OMG SOMEONE ACTUALLY SOLD IT ONLINE
6I mean
6they're rare enough s it is
02Gaaaah
02Tegami Bachi, why do you torture me sooo
6OMG
6IT IS TRUEEEEEEEE
/me 6cryyyy
o
10Tegami Bachi sounds very familiar
6I got my acceptance letter to one of my universities
6which
6I thought would decline me for sure
6biw I'm like
6asdfgh
02I've probably talked about it, otherwise you've might have seen the anime
02Congrats Roara :3
10Before you talked about it, yes I've heard of it
02you* .-.
02It's only a monthly manga, so when I'm left in suspence I have to wait so long
10http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6744.msg258149#msg258149 <- Some ideas we can build upon
10o.o
10Locked?
6?o.o
10Someone locked the topic
lol
/me unlocks
I wonder who
10Feather or Kyu
10yup
10?
10o-o I didn't lock anything
07me niether
6o.o
Arti..
/me thinks Kyu is joking
10Arti isn't on anyway
07I didn't =|
6arti isn't on-
6wth
10Even with invisible mode
10She isn't on
07in fact I was coming up with a post
Ah
10Well, unlocked it anyway
10Mods can't see invisibles anymore lol
10We can see when they're viewing the topic
6well, she's not on, I don't see her
10It will show up as +1 hidden
10oh
10right
10Good post, Xeli
.
10hm?
Nothing, just :3
6yeah good things reminding me of the competition
6it's kinda been on hold
6for obvious reasons
6but yes, we were trying to get the next one started
I see o.o. What kind of competition? And great point in the post too - it's not "everyone else", it's "all of us" =P
6well
6it's a suprise lololol
6but yeah, I'll prod articuno so we can finish it
i see¬®
10Suprises are fun
6our main problem is the prizes
6we haven't decided on it yet
10Free art?
6that's the thing
10if you're not keen on spending money
6I told her it was a possibility, but she doesn't feel up to it anymore, and i really REALLY don't have the time for that
6but at the same time
6if we can't think of anything else
6that will be a fallback plan
6dunno who would be putting art in for prizes though
10I was thinking of you, but after what you just said, lol
10Unless someone on TST wants to offer
02Yeah...
6I would but I also don't feel like I'm good enough for that lol
02Pssh
10eh, I might be up for it, but I don't feel I'm good enough :/
02PsshX2
02You two are both great :U
6if we can time it right, I'd be able to do something for a prize, but for the next two weeks I'm not doing anything prize related lol
10Yeah
10Give more credit to yourselves
6BFOI has that spot
6considering I've wasted a ton of time lol >.>
10well, gtg
6same
02cya Feather :,

Oh, I see, I'll do that next time XD
"Warning: tampering with the One Ring may result in Invisibility, rushes of euphoria, seeing the ghostly images of the Nazg√ªl, voices in your head that may or may not belong to the Ring, complete and utter dependence on the Ring, loss of clear thought and sanity, and eventual death.

02Oh lol
7Explain.

02Your birfday
Altair needs to fix that
x.x
I need a new spyro game
Actually I'll see if I can fix that
02NS
It's in the CSS somewhere
02It's just showing it's your birfday today
02Nothing else
There's nothing but opinions there.
02Your name is still red
I'm curious now.
Don't we all?
/me is too lol
I beat the original 100% and now there is nothing to do but play the portable one I have almost completed
7?
th enew one looks meh...
but i'll wait and see how it turns out
I only have the old versions, but I heve only rented the dawn of the dragon game
02Curious
and beat it too, almost 100%
Ah
that's weird
95% or so
Don't worry about it
I'm probably just raging for no reason
like I usually do
Well you're not one to get mad about opinions and such that's why I went like
04Probably
/me kicks NS
the fudge yo
and all
02No raeging on your birfday or else :U
04XD
Lol
but now I have to restart
stay away from enter the dragonfly and the eternal night
my old game shark deleted it, but I never cheated at the game
7Kyu, y'done with the video?
07yup
1st game si so easy
Y?, dragon fly was fine when I played it, a bit short though
7Mmm'kay.

so whats everyone up to
7Gah, I've gotta go. D:
o~ cya then .-.
04Ok, cya Quan
hay, are you by chance on the dark spyro forums?
Xeli
there's an exception to that lol
You know I stand up for my friends no matter the situation
some of the things that have been said about my friends is just damn unfair
Well everyone is just being honest in that thread, and honesty is something that is often unfair.
8% downloaded
And I know you mean it well, in your very own way=P
its taking forever
nothing much, you?
xD
hmh
Yeah I know that
It's good that everyone is being honest here
Because that's something that has begun to lack recently...
for me at least
02brb food
not talking about here

nothing at all. :|
/me eats NS
02Ok back

There's a difference between being honest and being an ass though.
Everything has its place

I'm so easily amused when tired
13This is such a late response, but it seems my comp is too much of a fail to play Animator vs Animation 3 :|
it's not even funny
lmfao
it's okay
and really? It's just a flash animation
Wow you've always said it's afail but wow xD
And HIiii :3
use like, adobe flash player although adobe's crap eats up a lot of resources
:D
adobe LOVES some RAM
it must be related to firefox
/me squeaks and sighs
13my computer and adobe don't get along :B
Adobe eats ram for breakfast
as we're talking firefox hogs 756 MB of my RAM. On my old laptop that would actually be a problem.
But then again, YOUTUBE TABS EVERYWHERE
Adobe eats Disk Space for dinner XD
It also eats money, or it wants to do so.
c:
wats that?
13My comp has the minimum amount of RAM to run on
13and it's too old to buy moar
13Something tells me I need a new computer
Adobe Ai Price: $699 I think
13But that costs moneyyy
Wouldn't hurt =P. And if you first get a new one,get one that will last a while xD
[10:57:56] <Espeon> adobe LOVES some RAM
[10:58:03] <Espeon> it must be related to firefox
XD
the more expensive something s the more amusing it is to find the serial keys through a simple google search
13Well this one's lasted for over 10 years, so |D
Wow
Altair's old server was a 10 year old computer
That's quite old in COMPUTER land.
02baack
Wbizzle
02tyizzle
Heh
Of course, I see why Adobe eats up ram
I slapped a new LAN card in that thing and I now use it as a stereo :)
xD
shoutcast box ftw
13Hasn't bothered me too much though, so long as it runs Touhou, Youtube and basic programs fine then I'm happy
13though it IS slow as hell
Adobe works like magic
13but I'm used to it |D
What OS are you running?
Windows on a old box = loss of hair
02NSSS
13XP
mario kart wii
02NSSS
Lol, thats what I ran
;o
If she said Vista I would
[07:00:47] <Altair> Windows on a old box = loss of hair <-only if you dont know how to use it
probably curl up and cry in horror
/me needs to PM youuu
Windows on ANY box = loss of hair
:P
why?
I still have hair.
<Altair> Windows on ANY box = loss of hair
qft
Lies
nonono, let altair speak
Until the day it actually starts annoying me I see no reason to switch xD
you don't need to ask xD
inb4 pros/cons everywhere erryday
Saame Espeon
02I wasn't asking
13!espeon
i want to see altair say linux works with everything
02I was informing that I was PMing you, like it or not
OH MAIZ WindOWZ SuckzORs CauSe TEh SLoWZ
n2, I use Windows on a regular basis
I IZ ImpAtIeNt
/me curls up under Xeli
02Yo Altair
Linux is a better OS, but good luck playing games
no, good luck DOING anything
;P
Haha XD
You don't need luck if you know what you are doing.
n2 finally wins my respect
linux is made by supernerds for other supernerds
As I see it
Who hate other people who aren't
nearly every OS has its use
ah
<Altair> Linux is a better OS, but good luck playing games
02SO YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT
i run linux on anything that has a specific purpose
not like I play games that much
02Because I ate or not
and just like VIDYA GAMING PLATFORMS - pick the one you like and simply leave others alone to do the same
:3
I only use linux for HDD purposes
I dislike Windows because with each release, it gets more bloated
this comp can't run Assassin's Creed ;-;;
yeah Altair
LOL bloated XD
any windows release is bloated
for example, my dns, time server and router run linux
yo
nintendo
oh dns
Altair
so is my webserver
you need to fix bind9
yeah i know
itc opinions presented as facts
you talk about windows being bloated and you run bind?
-.0
*-.-
o.o
hell, my server runs 2003
o-o
Yes
spyro d yo
02~
/me bangs head on wall
sry, im abit bussy, so mario kart, fun game
i hate server03
~ is all-powerful.
it works
Windows 7 is less bloated than Vista which is more bloated than XP which is more bloated than 98/2000 which is more bloated than the DOS/3.1 < Cause of new features?
It serves its purpose
*not
your both here that's good
and at least I can kill Altair's comp
when I want to
vmware hated server03 when i ran it
k
vmware hates everything
vmware likes windows XP?
My room is all clean and nice now |3
don't run it in a vm then
lol
i am not?
Install to your HDD then
15%
Thats good :3
i dont want 5 PCs running linux for different purpose
hi Altair
hi HML
i ran server03 to test out active directory
still taking forever
/me drags Altair to PM on other server
boy did that crash and burn
02So is <3
I'm always cleaning my room, but it's so nice when it's clean ^^
xD
13Clean rooms are cosy rooms
13good for sleeping in
I hate cosy :(
Comfy chairs
XD
xD
o-o
;o
;D
I have no reason to use anything else
I installed it to test it out and I left it on there
:D
It does fine for what I use it for
you cant say that if you do nothing with it :<
13I'm pretty much the tidiest person in the house
13the only reason my room is so cramped and untidy is because my mum dumped stuff into my room that she doesn't want anymore >:/
I'm right on the middle when it comes to tidiness lol
13such as a lovely big set of drawers right in front of the door
Hi, Kitten <3
k
/me is random when it comes to tidiness
hi
13which I still walk into sometimes when I'm not paying attention
i could use regular XP for the server
02I usually don't care one way or another
why dont you?
02And then suddenly I'll be like "I need to clean up my shtuff"
because i cba to switch
:P
13hey Army
and that is the first real answer you gave
13People tell me I have mild OCD because I go insane if my room isn't tidy
13they're all "you're a teenager, your room's supposed to be messy"
13D:
I used to be like
why should i switch?
I knew where everything was as long as it was untidy :3
Now I'm the other way around
13I'll be honest, my wardrobe is pretty untidy
13but I cba tidying that because it's always closed so no one sees it xD
rectangle > any os
02Exactly Xeli XD
.-.
I keep most of my room clean
except my bed
13and yes, my wardrobe is the exception where it's untidy but I know exactly where all my clothes are
I'm so happy I don't have that to highlight me
T_T
13Organised mess FTW
My bed only gets made on the weekends XD
3OS info: StarFOX on WinXP Professional 5.1 Service Pack 2 (Build #2600)
lol army
02I remembered seeing something that reminded me of NS
<Altair> why should i switch?
02what was it now...
it'd also take the server down
02Oh yeah! The end of the world
for like, an hour or so
hello?
an hour?
while you wait for XP to install
:{D
thats not a huge deal
yes it is
13Not only do I make my own bed every day, I'll also make anyone else's bed if I see a bed that hasn't been made yet
more like 6 hours :<
13it makes the entire room look untidy IMO D:
oh yeah 6 hours
xD
XD
you install XP, then you have to install everything else
That IS kinda ocd'ish lol :3
but n2, why should i switch?
ba dum tsch
/me pokes Altair to PM
i am not telling you to switch
i am just venting at you
:P
lol
but i still think server03 is stupid
heya Aero
12aeroo
Hello~
nintendo is playing a game, icedragon hasnt sent anything for a bit
the windows built in server components are failures
unless you treat it like server03 instead of XP; then it will work
12zero called he forgot to give you a pizza
13I also go insane if someone picks up something in my room then puts it down somewhere else
Hmm
13It was in that certain place for a reason, put it baaack D:
pizzaaaaaaaaaa
i don't use them though :P
12too busy trying to plot to steal giaratina again

?
xD
o.o
42%
nah, leave it alone
10Except half of the people affected by this aren't RCMs, so we cannot move it to Community Gossip
sry, go on
it's one person vs. everyone :P
10Yeah
bunnie 's pov
131/0
wat
why did she/he request that?
iah wasn't sure back then did iah make the right choose
and imo it should be a public
thing
also I have to say
Everyone should be able to have an opinion
in this show
there's a character
but some of the crap said in that topic is terrible
10"In the past I have administered a few sites, and unfortunately they have died because of topics like these. This kind of topics split communities as united as I have seen on this one, and only bring demise."
10Like we won't ALREADY split
who keeps complaining about how short her feather is

/me gets drf to divide by 0
10"I can only offer an idea, that is to create a forum or chat (a free one like forumer or invisionize) to deal with this particular issue, and keep it out of reach for the newer members and those that are more sensible to infighting"
hay use punctuation,so I can tell if they are talking or the end of a line
10going against our new rule about ew, but EW INVISION
sure'
that would help me understand a bit better
more like EW PROBOARDS
/me had to say that :/
10That too
LOL
intermission over
bbl
10I told Sunny to let us handle this
good
10because tbh this is how we've solved everything in the past
iah got to be with man of mah dreams.
10being both honest and direct
!lag
Taking it out of view has no effect other than "We're not sure if we can even solve this so we'll hide it ;-;"
Yes

...no.
XD
!lag
/me hopes that was a joke
not bad
yeah
your welcome mason
o
btw
look at ps
;D
10We've had enough arguments over silly scripts like those
10a good example is Kipi
I wanted to see your's guys reply XD
oh yeah
xD
13SKY!
/me tackle hugglesa
Your*
thanks
02I would start one
02But I don't think anyone would want to own me lolol
:D*
lol, Kipi
But yeah, one of the main things causing all these problems
for some odd reason he hates me
and he hates Altair just because he admins HoR
sdfghjk;ljghjyu
meh
12yeah
12fish
02:o
I do
;p
02orly now
Me too. But it needs no script c:
!lag
12omg
02And why is that? :P
12don't even get me started with kipi
x.x
12-.-
Lol
yeah Umbreon
02I'm still wondering why Kipi hates HoR so much
yeah
12the guy banned me from his own channel on another server
wat
12because i wouldn't modify a script that was only active here
Wasn't it because you
.
seriously?
12yes
02I mean, some people's views I understand, but I never figured out Kipi's reason
your !umbreon script or something?
didn't make !umbreon reply you belonged to him permanently or something?
12yes
Lol
.
lol
Because internet is obviously serious business.
XD
12i swear he had it in for me for some reason
Shiny
I agree with you
12i was so glad when he left
probably because some people here hated on us and then he made his decision based on that
but meh, I dunno
well I don't think I was there when he left
but I saw his DA
Lol
and went wtf at his comments on HoR
It seems like he doesn't have a reason really.
XD
10Sunny >>
What did Sunny say now? o-o
10"Makes me really sad that when a few members and myself are trying to save this forums from an evitable demise due to a topicas dangerous as this, you just send me a reply as poor as this, when you have enormous power in your hands that many would kill for, while you seat there and refuse to use them. "
02Is this in a PM?
10yes
10enormous power made me lmao

02I didn't think it was Sunnyblob
02she doesn't sound like that IMO
02which makes me go WTF, and LOL at the same time
xD

Right. So, why are you RPing here?
It's against the rules. :P

wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee i get pinged
Heh, someone on GreenKeys is offering up some pretty retro computer gear.
Then take it the RP channel. I'd like to talk here.
What?
12Lightning: You talkin' bout my man?
02:D?
Like?
And by "pretty retro" I mean "not even remotely retro."
Three impact printers.
OK
6to who?
From the early 80s.
Anyone.
e-Machines computers?
6yes icy
/me hides
6he hasnt said anything
Irrelevant. :P
12Wait.......... what?
New LexMark Z-Series printer, 12" color composite Apple display and that's it.
oo
Of the impact printers, the most "standard" one is probably the most retro.
7Bayes's theorem. :|
7It's confusing me.
As it's for 15" wide paper, 9 pin dot matrix.
although we can rp here its technically against the rules and a seperate chat was made for roleplaying
Dari's not responding, and it seems like Icy's involved in this, so I won't interrupt.
Perhaps I want to be technical.
And for eMachines stuff... I advise the Vintage Computer Forums... lots of people, lots of stuff.
Some actually selling their stuff. :P
you can't get on it though if you signed using spyrochat.com
I could rather have an IBM Model M
Compact sized, with no numpad
6Im on spyrochat
Then I could spraypaint the sides glossy black
o_O
not the rp channel though
/me squeaks

12How old are you?

12DUN DUN DUUUUUN
/me is listening to Thousand Sunds
Suns*
10Linkin Park?
6k?, whats that got to do with me?
12sunds lol
"„ÄêTouhou„Äë [I] made Final fiend sister Flandre‚Ä¢S's sheet-music pitch-black revised version"
10Their new album = crap
the I isn't actually in there
12I like em young
but it's implied
10The only song I did like somewhat was The Catalyst
whats their new album called?
Thousand Suns
/me wants LP to go back to the Hybrid Theory/Meteora style
Old enough to count, old enough to mount.
03hm
Flandre's theme?
03so basically they're saying it's a refised sheet music version?
12;3
03*Revised
03I mean, that makes sense
03yeah
Catalyst, Burning in the Skies, and Reqiuem are my favorites
dunno
03UN Owen Was Her is another name for Flandre's Theme
agreed ^
03apparently
&DRF, ne more questions about owen16.m4a?
03I don't play the games
03well
oh no, it's the actual name
:o
6hay, nintendo get a hold of this, they want my age
03there's no way you could fix it and save it as MIDI?
Flandre's theme is "UN Owen Was Her"
We want it NOW.
ah
‚Ä¶
either way, since im like a MAJOR linkin park fan, i like it all :P
6anyway, wat you been up to?
well it's not the title is what I'm saying XD
I could save as midi, but that would produce similar problems as the original one, so it's pointless.
03hm
Nope.
03well
03what exactly causes those problems?
6OK?, just Y!?
10Consider me a veteran fan
03is it just too many notes at once?
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jItz-uNjoZA
yeah
you want to find the MIDI?
'kay
12cheese
too many MIDI events close to each other,
If we had, that would be a sorry excuse for a planned joke. xD
got a hoodie, got dogtags, got a hat, got a wrist band, etc :P phone cover :P yeaaah XD
let me check some things
/me squeak :(
/me has the wristband. :3
oh
10wearing it right now
03there's a link in the description
03what I want to know
03is what program they used
03to make that video
yeah, that's what I was confused about
03because obviously it's like
oh, okay
03the only thing
03that can play it
03without crashing
03>_>
lolz i wear everything to school XD
03I mean I even tried QuickTime
03as much as I hate Apple
03it failed just as much
03even Sibelius the godlike MIDI program
03can't play it for crap
03>_>
hmm, it's not in the description
I just saw a video from a tube camera which really makes me glad we moved over to CCD
I'll check the profile
03what's the description say?
notes are MIDI events,
lots of streaking and image sticking issues
03Other than "here is a link to the MIDI"
there are also other types of midi events, like sustain and pitch/tempo changes.
10I was shocked to hear Waiting for the End on the radio
sibelius is not a godlike MIDI program. it is a score program which has MIDI and VSTi/sf playback capabilities.
;o
10or why it is even on iTunes to begin with
10it friggin sucks
03well

this is it
03it did a little better of a job than DirectShow
03but not by much
a camera using the Vidicon tube
things about what they used (from other vids) and links to other videos and a link to download the MIDI or the actual sheet music or the original vid and things like that
lolz going to their Concert tomorrow XD
03hm
03and that program isn't ringing any bells, is it?
6what is up with that song?
also, do you want to try kontakt sampler?
03It has to be some Japanese thing though, because pretty much any YouTube videos I've seen that have a Japanese title and are about MIDI music, it's using that program LOL
12*pedo laugh*
o3o
o3o
03EW THAT FACE
if it was LL, you wouldn't complain, ae?
10^ What state?
12He died ;D
Pennsylvania
‚Ä¶ interesting twitter background they have there
That is 1970's/1980's camera technology
03actually I would
Can't be helped
03I told LL to stop with the face LOL
lolz Phili, i think it said its tomorrow O.o
03and she actually uses "oxo" now instead
6he just got on
03as SHE actually listens to me
03:P
It sucks
He was DOA.
Sorry. :/
6he didnt say anything but he can see this
i haet oxo because it's not the original o3o
03how is o3o an original face?
03for that matter
10You "think"?
03how is ANY emoticon origina?
03l
But you will like to know that news organisations used these kind of cameras to record a lot of history
6what-ever
10Then how can you be sure you're going?
03people just use them at will
Why so serious?
xD
brb
‚Ä¶ well their first video is available as an MUS, which is stated can be only opened by Finale
6cause I can be
03yeah
better quality ones though
03I have Finale.
Well that makes o3o just like every other one.
03that's not what's used in the video :/
:O Shut me down.
CCD r also cheap
03Espeon I never sai dit wasn't
03it's just annoying, that's all
Ok.
hmm
12Let's make love
03there are other annoying faces too
03but people here don't use them as much
?
10the website says Pennsylvania was January 31...
I won't repeat what I've said many times earlier and instead just chuckle silently by myself.
6ooooooo, like i care
O.O
Hold on, let me finish with my other partner.
they are now jun
03I'm not saying people can't use it, I'm just saying EW THAT FACE
but were non-existant back in the early 1980s
03You can still use it as much as you want, I'll just keep saying that
03:P
6what your left hand?
12general?
Indeed
Sinister.
12OH SNAP
You are talking about 1980's
Never said anything else :P
6so now its the right
12I use both :)
My first three years of life were spent there
6good one
And I know how low-tech that era was compared to now
That was so clever, I almost died.
03anyway
Shock me, Paddle Girl.
You 1990's and later people are so lucky when it comes to technology
03I'm gonna go for a bit
dammit "Linkin Park concert cancelled Feburary 26th 2011" T_T
03Xbox Live and whantot
03*whatnot

Well, looks like a gtg too

Seeyas
See you.
finaly Its stop kicking me out
02Someone call for me?
hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh ;p
!floof
:P
aww
sup
6the internet crashed for a minut, icy, nintendo, anyone
I hate vim.
12huh...
What's wrong with vim?
I refuse to use that despicable piece of CRAP.
6ok, yea I can talk again
emacs is worse. :P
so like
(There I felt that soul pain again.)
after running Oblivion for four hours or so
;o
12so... what did you mean?
the underside of my computer now causes second-degree burns on touch.
XD
SNEAS
/me hugs
back from a logoff because a UI bug
and lmfao
damn windows >.>
Could have been worse.
Your PC might have caught fire. :P
nah
6the last thing I sent, I dont know what hapend but Im back
okay it's worse
but pico > vim
6I had to restart my computer
I can't stand vim
12ok
6yea it sucked, I thought no one would still be on, but I got here
6anyway, what now?
It works in a pinch.
vim is just different
Also, it's not as bad as some... wonderful... editors that shall not be named.
12idk
12kristen?
(I HATE Lisp machines... SO MUCH!)
6who?
6or what?
12just gotta check
XD
6check what?
12nevermind
6ok
x_x
12p
Altair
before it was burned in a fire
6;) rawr
my old laptop would smoke every time it was plugged in
o.o
Also... I HATE Lisp... SO MUCH!
:P
and before that, it would regularly power down after hitting around 75C or so
:P
lol
12raaaaaaaaaawr
I could NEVER use Linux or Mac OS as my primary operating system
My old laptop used to do that all the time.
6RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRR
At first I didn't know why, then I touched it.
6lol
6:/
I think my finger still has the mark.
:(
12hm
and because people make software for windoze, people make software for windoze
its a cruel cycle
I don't mind which OS I use... as long as it doesn't mind people poking and prodding at its innards.
Which Windows doesn't like... but usually doesn't mind.
its because of that plus specialized hardware
you try getting an Express Card TV tuner to work under Mac OS
mac os is silly
IF you could afford the card after buying the computer
6sooooo, Its late, what to do, what to do
Linux is... well seeing the fact I'm short of a supercomputer only becuase I don't have the money for the powerbill and I don't have enough PCs for a Beowulf boxen...
12dunno
tap off your neighbors >:D
:|
Out of curiousity
in fact that brings up the biggest thing I have against Mac OS
did it have a P4?
Apple's terrible price points
I would NEVER buy any kind of Mac
they have the worst price/performance ratio out of any computer manufacturer today
6have you ever played any Halo games (conversation starter)
nah, it was an AMD.
12nope
$1500 Hackintosh > $4000 Mac Pro
ah
correct
6oh, they're fun games
It just has a poorly placed intake vent. lol
which also happens to be the size of an unfolded paper clip.
haha
12so ive heard
not to mention you can get the same Foxconn hardware in HP machines that you find in Macs these days for less than half the price
eh? I do that occasinally, it doesn't complain.
6yea, and they take place,all in one years worth of time
mine had three fans and holes all along the sides, bottom and back
Also, the fact that Mac laptops are made in Taiwan by the same company that produces about most all the other laptops on the planet Earth, means you're paying for basically a not very well pimped Toshiba. :P
putting a P4 into a laptop was plain stupid
rofl
6but, not the best conversation at this point
XD
Did you build it yourself or something? I've never seen a retail laptop with that many fans.
6can you think of something to talk about?
It's like making a Trabant into a pimpmobile... sure it looks blingtastic... but you're going to get about a half block before the engine stalls.
haha
6can be something random, like Halo
12Soso
12Love
it was my brothers, and apparently he custom ordered it
12Kingdom hearts?
brother's lol
plus if you want a flashy OS you can just get PC-BSD
its very similar to Mac OS X at the kernel level
6goog game,but never played it
12:o
12You should
i can use linux as a daily operating system, but os x is a nono
12!anagram Altair
6I want to
12-define cookie
and yeah pc-bsd is good
oops
Or just use Compiz on a Linux box. :P
XD
i had it turned off
12yeah
(I forget if Compiz also works on BSD.)
12i'm well aware how it lags you
compiz is pure win
I could not do that
12Kh 2 is the best, what systems do you have?
lol
though it's 110% unnecessary XD
because I use some programs that are Windows specific without any Linux equivalents
6almost all of them
because I use some programs that are Mac specific without any Windows equivalents
6just not the realy old ones
is there such a thing?
no
sure is
lol
My desktop (which is getting to be old...) is a dual Ubuntu (ugh)/Windows XP system.
12Well then you could get them all I guess
6I could try
some of the audio processing tools I use are Windows only
6but, no garenty
i have 7 and debian on one HDD, and another with osx86
My future plans once I get a new box, and this one is wiped/given to mom? Take her boring box, and my grandpa's boring old box... and begin Project Excelsior.
though im planning on wiping my osx86 since i never use it
And if you're wondering, yes I name my PCs.
:P
All after various ships in Star Trek. :P
the processing tools are fairly important for one thing I do
6.......
because the hardware equivalents cost several thousand dollars
12Perhaps
i've named all of my main computers "whirl" for the past 7-8 years
6yes?
dunno why :D
Currently, my box/box-that-was-mine-and-is-now-used-by-mom are named after Constitution-class ships.
12Yyyyyeees
(No, nothing has "Enterprise" as a name yet... becuase if I name it that I'm guaranteed to have something strange happening every half minute.)
LOL
6nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
6oooooooooooooooo
6fine
Mum has Defiant. I have Hood. Next box is Lexington.
6lol
12lololololol
My grandfather's boxes are all named after the Daedalus-class ships.
6lmao
6lmfao
(Former box is Daedalus, current is Icarus, next is Phoenix.)
Project Excelsior is named after... well watch Star Trek III once. :P
it's been a while since i last saw III
I use Stereo Tool for on air AM and FM processing and cannot find Linux equivalents of this at all
(Because of it's radical departure from the ships of TOS design, the Excelsior is my codename for a planned Beowulf cluster.)
or any of the old series for that matter :(
6hmmmmmmmmmm
and random, but senior citizens who know how to use computers FTW
heh
;o
the hardware equivalents cost a great deal of money even at the low end
heya Zephyr
6is this going to be an all night chat, or what
i really should make it work for a select few
6?
because often times when someone uses it, 30 others try it as well
:P
plus how often do you see a processor designed for AM that operates in stereo rather than mono?
Soom
6hello?
Ho
*hi
6did you change you user name?
Currently planned server box (which may supercede Excelsior by one PC) is to be named after the Federation-class demi-canon ships.
6or are you new?
I changed it
6ok, made me think you quit
I'm currently stuck on whether to name it Unifactum, Compactat or Concordat.
nah
(Which are NCC-2102, NCC-2103 and NCC-2109 respectively.)
6dont scare me like that,I would have been alone

lol
just look at the first 2-3 lines
and ignore the rest
:{D
My hobby list is exceptionally... insane.
6feels like I started hours ago, but only a few hours
As the other topic was locked with everyone's agreement, we'll start a new one.
Alright, so, what should we do? We've hopefully gotten past the "blame everyone" stage, so let's throw some good ideas out there. It's
but
but
6not even that long
that is an example of one weirdness that I have
it makes no sense
/me shot
that song is actually going out on air
12i know right?
12hmhm, internet does that to you
lmfao Altair
XD
6wow, I wouldnt know this is the longest I've ever been on
if I had a better receiver I would make recordings
/me np: Pok√©mon - Together Forever [03:55m/192kbps/44kHz]
Some random bug was just flying around my room hitting its head on my light bulbs.
6havent had internet for the longest time
Then it fell and stopped moving.
12makes sense
Wonder if it burned itself.
I am thinking AM Radio by Everclear and I Only Wanna Be With You by Dusty Springfield
it endured a heart attack
6yea
o_O
7Good night.
6I like having internet, I can connect to other people
yes, i am off to bed as well
See you both.
I'll probably be heading out in 10 minutes or so,
night people
7See ya.
03wtf
6have you been on a spyro fansite called dark spyro forums, easyer to find on google
I do have to wake early to get back to Brock after spending a week at home. :P
12its fun yes
in the case of airplay on here
D:
12yeah i have
03I just found out Luna has the same birthday as me o:

o_O

6cool, Im on there as well
Brock?
Brock University
oh
In St. Catherine's (Ontario).
I'm currently in Hamilton (Ontario).
6same name
/me np: Everclear - AM Radio [03:46m/852kbps/44kHz]
12me too
6cool
that could be changed
12sweeeeeet
6yea, I had a bad start, but its geting better
instead of AM Radio more like AM Stereo
in fact I am playing this on 1450 AM right now
k...skylands isn't here
wonderful
ok
this sounds more dominant and in your face than normal AM
/me np: Dusty Springfield - I Only Wanna Be With You [02:35m/991kbps/44kHz]
Aurora
there's a new topic
http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6749.0
sry it kicked me off again
6yeah
6I'm merging it back
why?
6there's no reason to have two topics
well
6I'm upset skylands locked it
6I'm unlocking it
the current one is escalating into fail
6because it actually was perfectly on topic
.-.
6I explained it earlier
6yes, things are being said about each other
6but in this current situation

6for people to realize what we have wrong with ourselves, how others view us
True
6and believe it or not, we HAVE been giving suggestions
well your choice
6seems like people are just ignoring it
yeah
6even though I specivially said it at least 5 times today
:|
we may have to continue this talk tomaro
6leave it, it's on topic, we're suggesting things, etc
I didn't see
timezones fail but yeah, it's not too bad
You can merge my post or leave it out
ohadjfasdf
6I'll merge it in
wat
6because even though I didn't read it through, it's most likely on topic
6considering when you created the topic
6it wasn't specific
6it was a general topic that I assumed would invovle both problem and solutioh
6solution
Icy?, I guess I'll see you tomaro?
6;) see ya
/me np: Dusty Springfield - You Don't Have To Say You Love Me [02:48m/832kbps/44kHz]
this one caused a problem with bass distortion
o.o
Well...
I'm heading out now.
wonderful first thing to see just coming back from another window.

Wanted to restart my computer for a bit
03stupid 5th gen legendaries
/me goes to sleep no z_z
03yes I know Reshiram != Zekrom
03but I get confused
02now*
xD
<Aurora> thought you afk'd :P
yeah I did
but I lurk too much
6lol
/me sighs
03to reply or not to reply to that forum debate thread
03that is the question
6might as well reply
I think not
Maybe later
6everyone and their mothers have already
my room wants me to clean it
03LOL
03also
6so does mine! D:
03what is this I heard about some "no ew" thing
03I mean
03it's just a word LOL
6just read
6it's not the word
03I was going to say I'll stop going EW B/W as much
2b or not 2b
03I did read Aurora
03I've been refreshing the page all dya
03just not bothered to quote and reply
my maths teacher's favourite question
6.....lol
-.-
you can do that all you want around me
the EW B/W thing
03XD
03and I find it funny
6ok
because I don't think I will be playing either one of those two games
03back on hoshinet
6guess I'll sit here and explain it out
03which is ultimately where I got it from
6once again
03blame usotsuki for it, not me XD
xd
he was the worst in it
03he's the one who started it
03I got it from him
03heck
03it caught on
uso is cool
03some of my IRL friends
mention something he hated and he would say EW *thing he hates*
03now say EW stuff
03it's awesome
6I say this chat needs to learn tolerance, I predict you say "learn to tolerate my ews"
xD
03no
03I wasn't going to say that at all
03in fact
6understandable, but you don't seem to understand just HOW MUCH people tolerate out of you
03I was going to say on the forum
I found it annoying there because he kept bashing every little thing
6wow have you learned?
6ok then, my mistake
03that I'll work on not saying EW B/W as much
Hi Aurora :3
03now
03I will *never* stop saying EW APPLE
03but
03I only do that
I mean EVERY SINGLE THING
03when people bring it up
6tone it down
03and recently that hasn't been much at all
03so
6drf, that's the thing
03I don't think *that* is the problem
03well
03the B/W thing, well
03I realize with the games coming out soon
6those situations are when you just need to shut up
LMFAO ROFL LMAO, I was in probably THE funniest skype call EVER XD
03that people are going to be talking about it
lol, drf may always be drf
03and there's nothing I can do to sto pit
03So I'll stop with that
6it is not your job to automatically comment in the conversation to say ew
03but seriously, who here doesn't know that I hate Apple? It's like... why do people even care?
03LOL
03I don't
03it's not like I return from AFK to say that
03and then leave again
!ew Apple haters
03well I did once
!ew B/W Haters
...oh
/me RUNS
03and I say :( because I don't WANT it to be off
03someone unplugged i6t
6no but, even when you are here
03I blame the dorm staff
6just....don't comment at all
6yes, we know you hate apple
03OK but see
6and for the most part, we're completely sick of it
03toning it down != stopping en6tirely
6it's gotten old
6REALLY fast
03I mean
03honestly
03look in your logs if you want
03and I can bet you
tbqh if people are offended by it then it's really their own fault
6tone it down A LOT
03that I haven't gone EW APPLE more than like 10 times in the past month
03it's mostly *other things* that I say EW to
6what of the new people, as we mentioned in the topic
03Aurora, well, what new people? :P
6it HAS HAPPENED where new people walk in
03I realize we have less of them here but
03usually there aren't
well that's true
03so
6and then leave when he says that
I ate an apple today
03...
6drf
6still
/me hides
dafhsdf
03give me one example when someone left because I said EW APPLE
6people are frustrated
tabfail
6>.>
03other than when you raged on me
I love eating apples
?
03because I've never seen it happen
03ever
There so good tasting
03LOL
03see
03apples the food I like
6maybe not the apple, but I know for a fact people have gotten upset about it
03believe it or not :P
I like granny smith one the best
03though mainly green ones
03YES
03Same here
>discussion turned into apples
?
I mean hi
03I was just making fun of her for using a Macbook
6...
03I didn't mention it more than like two times
:U
6can you read that statement please
03erm sorry
03replace making fun of with poking fun at
03better?
03I use the word lightly >_>
I don't like it when apples taste too bitter though
6again, read it
6not everyone is the same
03I did, why
6and some people can take it offensively
you've laughed multiple times at my mac applications :U
03XD
03well
03you know now that I'm joking around, right? :P
6it's one thing for people to say "why so serious"
I like them as sweet as they can be :3
03LOL
xD
but I don't really mind 'cause you say that about many things that I seem to like C:
6but in all seriousness...it's just old crap now >.>
03again
03I haven't even done that much at all recently
03go look at logs if you want
6just, keep it toned down
03I mean other than yesterday when I was like "Random, but EW IPADS"
03and that was me ranting about the Verizon store
03because I kid you not, they turned HALF THE STORE into an Apple store
6ok ok I'm done
03which made me rage pretty hard at them IRL
lmfao
03I walk in there
03I'm like
yeah, that was lame
03you have FOUR IPHONES AND TWO IPADS ON DISPLAY
03you have ONE of each of the other phones
03WHY
03Why do you need 4 iPhones?
03I mean, OK, have one
03maybe two
03that's fine
because they're popular
03they're all the same phone
03I mean display models
oh
XD
Drake
03like, the ones sitting out that people can use
03yeah
03They had an entire wall devoted to iPhone + iPad
tbqh I liked Anakin when he looked normal
03it's just stupid honestly
instead of the mechanic darth vader
XD
03I mean, I'm not even going EW IPHONE, even
03Now that Verizon sells the iPhone
03I can understand if they want to have them on display
haven't been to a Verizon store since my sister got her phone updated
03but do they really need FOUR of them?
and that time I was really just sitting and drawing
03I was just there yes[terday XD
6I'm T-Mobile so yeh
03well yeah
03but still
6speaking of which
03I totally have the right to complain about how Verizon redid their store layout, don't I? LOL

I thought you said "I meant to turn right"
03I had to slam on the brakes several times
03no
03I was using right as an um
and I was like
03affirmative statement
03?
"So that's where you spun. You should've gone left"
03LOL
and Drake, his "nooooooooooo!" at the end of ep III is just not dramatic enough
xD
6ok
6so I was having a minor homework dillema this week, right
6my online class
6one of the assignments was to post in the class forum, something about our nutrition analysis
6had to be posted by 11:55 tonight
03anyway did anyone see the picture I posted>?
6we got the assingment on tuesday
:D
nope
6you posted a prt screen
6of the chat
lol
6anyways
03yeah but
What
03the point was
6so I did all my other assignments, and by friday I realized I had to do my forum assignment
oh
wait
6but no one had posted theirs
6I was gonna look at theirs for ideas lol >.>
6anyways
He used unicode
Most likely
I'm using unicode
6anyways
‚Ä¶
03still see a black square
oh I thought you were talking about drf
go ahead, think I'm a boy
I don't care
03LOL
03she looks enough like one
/me hides
/me chucks a brick
03I thought you agreed with me
03on that
6so friday night, I'm sitting there thinking "maybe my teacher blocked us viewing the other posts until sunday", because sunday we're supposed to comment on other peoples posts
XD
I know
6I go ahead and type my post up and post it
‚Ä¶
I just wanted to throw something at you
03LOL
6sure enough, this morning
03but wait
6no other posts
03are you typing 3 .'s
It's a unicode character
‚Ä¶ lol
6but within an hour of me checking
03or do you actually have a "..." character
no?
6there were 6 posts
Alt-0133
03¬Ö
03LOL
I have an ellipses character
03that make;s a black square
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
lol Roara
03WTF
6so I've decided my class is just really stupid
XD
03ah it shows up in Notepad
03WTF mIRC
‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶
6because it took until I posted for them to post
drf
03isn't it easier to type . . .
6and even now
03than do some sort of alt code
not really
You still using mIRC 6.x?
03or whatever you do
6with less than an hour
6only 8 posts in total are there
036.21 is awesome
it's sort of like me typing acksf acksf acksf
instead of something else
Explains things
03wait what
03you don't have a . key?
mIRC 7.1 and higher is uncode
6acksf?
Kyu was always saying "how do you type it that fast D:"
acksf acksf acksf
therefore it can display such characters with no problems
acksfacksfackfs
‚Ä¶
acksfacksfacksf
..
03yeah well the GUI of the new mIRC's sucks :/
...
not really much effort
GUI?
03GUI.
03as in
03the way it looks
Anyway, later
03since after all
oh
03IRC itself hasn't changed since the 1980s
ah
03it's just the programs used to get on it that change
6hmm...
03and the newer mIRC versions look dumb IMHO
6wth O_o
XD
03so I'm like, why update?
03since it's just text
03but that black square is just pissing me off
lol, see why
6my mum has the computer monitor sitting on a stack of printer paper
‚Ä¶
03and I really don't get why it's doing that
03unless
why‚Ä¶?
6I never noticed it was printer paper, but it's been there for years..
03maybe this font isn't working with it
6and yet
lol
03why @ what/
I like the GUI of 6.35
03I don't
03they changed all the icons
6we like....run out of paper and buy more
03which is dumb
03the /a key for scripts
03the s-> key for send
6WHY IS THIS ON A STACK OF PAPER?
03etc
xD
XD
because your mother is silly
6WHAT LOGIC IS THIS
6I mean seriously
03hm
03weird.
I know a lot of mIRC's commands and everything
but not x-chat's
03I changed my font and I can see the "..."
6then again, we are realted
6related
03but this font looks sooooo stupid
even though I've been using that for several months
erm
2 months
ahahaha
03hm
03I blame this font :/
03still
6oh...
03don;'t you have a . key>?
o-o
yes?
.
03yeah
03so why not just press it 3 times
heh
03doesn't it take more than 3 keystrokes to make a Unicode character?
becaaaaaause that requires moving down
:'D
the spambot is on the dronebl
6the next 3 weeks will be torture
gaaaaaah health
no
just two
03wait what
03o.o
03what do you press?
03because last I checked
alt-;
03Mac OSX was similar to Linux for that
‚Ä¶
03¬∂
03it does that here
03LOL
03oh
ahaha
03well
03try typing
6it's been nutrition, illnesses, stress coping, and mental health so far
03control+shift+ue9
03like
that's alt-7 for me
03hold control and shift
03then press u and e and 9
03before letting go
03it should make a √©
6now we get into the area of health I really would rather sleep through...or something
03LOL
03The fun part :D
/me hides
‚Ä¶
I get that with alt-e e
6because I know what you're talking about, only next week is that topic
√©
03hm weird
6the weeks after aren't
03anyway
03Aurora
03something that LL agreed with me on
03when I mentioned it to her on voice chat
03why are we still considering TST chat "PG" rated, since there's a new 13 and up rule
03why can't it be PG-13 LOL
I mean I could try switching to Dvorak and see if that changes anything
03since we *SHOULDN'T* have any little kids
03o_O
03Dvorak changes the entire key layout
because there still are
I could not agree more
03no there aren't o.o
6my views on that are weird
03if there are, then they're here against regulations
03because the rules say you have to be 13 to join >_>
03the only exception was those who were already here
03but I don't know of any that were on the chat
Cynder?
03well
6meaning, some topics really shouldn't be discussed in here
03Cyncer hardly ever comes on
03well
6that being one of them
03people seem to get annoyed when I make suggestive comment
03s
03it's like
03I never acutally say anything dirty
o-o
03I just make hints at stuff
03so I dunno what's so bad about it
I'm the one
03and LL agrees XD
6it's rude to many people o.o
who says dirty stuff
xD
So if anything
that stuff would be my fault
I agree with Roara
03wait
03how is it rude
03o.o
derp
6typical guy response there imo lol
03if I just make a random "that's what she said" comment
03that's not being *rude*
03o.o
^
03that's just trying to make someone laugh
04?
03and it usually makes someone laugh
03if not others get annoyed
6course, that's actually my upbringing
03but hopefully more chuckle XD
03hey
03my upbringing was like
03"No watching R rated movies until you're 18"
WISH
ROARA
6I just find it rude for people to be making jokes about that kind of stuff..
Nope, this chat needs to be friendly to ALL ages. Because I leave chat room that are not
03despite the fact that it says 17
03you're older than 13, yes?
6drf
I am
6that's my point
03then there you go.
6a person may be odler than 13
03but they still act like they're 4? LOL
my parents weren't strict after I turned 5
6that doesn't mean anything other than being legal to be on here
03then they need to grow up >_>
03I mean
/me chucks a brick at drf
03it's not like you have to get the jokes
03you can just be like
03"what"
03but it's not like
03it's actually hurting anyone
but then you go into this huge thing about how I should grow up
I hate swearing a sexual content and such
drf, it doesn't have to be hurtful to be rude
and*
yeah I know
03I mainly just say that
03if you say you don't get something
03that's a mature joke
03it's my way of saying that it is
03:P
'kay
6RULE
6NUMBER
6 1
6 1. Please do not bring up mature content, extreme violence or anything illegal such as drugs. We'd like to keep the site child friendly.
^
^
hooraaaaaay
6I'm not explaining any further
03LOLrules
03we have those?
/me hides
It should be brought to Purplesurge
I always wonder how many people actually read the rules
6...
/me runs
03I'm joking, relax
6today isn't the time to be joking about that imo
03k
Besides, you and LL, are well, never mind
03fine, remind me tomorrow
like, I read the whole terms and conditions before I joined dA
6NS that was...also uncalled for
I doubt most people do that
03LOL
03well
I've also done that for ProBoards things
03I don't read EULAS
03*EUALs
03gah

kjdafksdf highlight
03except for that part about not being allowed to use iTunes to make nuclear weapons
03that made me laugh
NS highlights me
x.x
03and I kid you not, it's actually in the iTunes EULA
03"You shall not use this software to make nuclear or biological weapons"
o3o
03something like that
03I'm like
03OK

03I'll use iTunes to make a bomb
03of course
Aurora people call me NS still
6oh really?

03it's Fixedsys Excelsior
03basically
03I use normal Fixedsys
03but that font is oldish
03that one SUPPOSEDLY supports unicode
03so :/
GAH

03ffs, this font sucks
03Fixedsys Excelsior
03it works fine for normal displays
03but for people who need "larger text"
03it fails
03I need a larger font size because of the insanely high screen resolution of my laptop x.x
hmm

03see

6I do remember us all going SKJSFGBDRKJGHDR LAST EPSODE
6that day it was aired

03I was like the only one only buying 4 things >_>
6people feel the need to buy out the store
03A pack of DVDs, a gift card, and then a Target giftcard + card
6which is why I wish we could have our express lanes open
03for my mom,
the only reason ambernova's and shadow's are about a week is because we had to restart the computers
03that was all
03yeah I know wright
03-w
because of CPU nomming
03you know what Target needs
6but yeah
03is a U-scan
and linux being a cunt
03like grocery stores have
03and like Walmart has
6how the systems are set up, you really don't have to read coupons at all
03it would make everyone's life so much easier
03I know
03tell that to the moron working at register 6
XD drf
/me hides
6if something's wrong, it gives you the error and then you read
well I like it because for once the bad guys actually succeed in something
6which yeah
6she's just slow
and Anakin actually looks sort of cool
lol
unlike the mechanical version of Darth Vader
lol
6I'm fast about getting my job done

03ahem
03new topic
6anyways
6this lady
6at work
6I had to card her, right
6cuz target has some strict rules on some products
6namely, other than alcohol
03o.o
03like R rated movies or somethiung?
03-u
6nyquil/dayquil, a lot of cold medicine
03oh weird
6M games
03I love how
03when I went to buy Watchmen on DVD
03I went to Walmart
6well
I loved StarWars episode 3 too
03the lady just hit "yes this customer is old enough"
03wihtout even asking me
03I was only 18
03she must have thought I looked a lot older
6one can in particular, a dust spray of some sort
03weird o.o
03they aren't strict about R rated movies?
6anyways
6nop
03or Parental Advisory labeled music?
6nope
03LOL fail
6we don't have a restriction on it
6which I thought was weird
03yeah that's dumb
03stupid 5 year olds buying R movies >_>
lolool
6anyways
6and she looked at me like I'd slapped her in the face
03LOL
6she's like "excuse me?"
03you should have just slapped her in the face for that
/me runs
6I asked if I could see her ID
6she had the pen for the credit scanner in her hand
6and basically tossed it onto the conveyor bel
6belt
lol
6she then proceded to aggressively dig out her ID and said "You must be new, good lord"
6which...I don't take kindly to that as that was a direct offense of my job imo, but I said "No ma'am, I'm not new actually...I'm supposed to do this"
6thing is, we need to scan ID, so when she just showed it to me, I asked if she could take it out
now now people,
6she gave me the card, I scanned it, finished the transaction, and she asked "Now why on earth did you card me?"
why dontu put them up on notalwaysright.com ?
/me hides
6I explained that the computer would not allow the product to be sold unless I had the ID, as company policty
6policy
6she then said "That's complete BS (the full term...)" and crumpled the reciept and threw it back into my station
6the next customer was so nice and was like "I am so sorry"
6I'm like lol
03XD
03I can just imagine Target stores in Texas
03"You want my ID? How about my pistol?"
/me hides
6LOL
lol
lolololo

oh you're a guy?
okay
also ignore that
I'm just like, really high right now
you can't be serious
nothing I say atm means anything okay?
without checking on the forums
mmmm, at first glance?
Other
eh i mean, Female
XD
Really? most would think I'm a guy
hm, i've got a different vision on peoples personalities
actually, then it would be a little mixed
there you go then
Or Lucien
Lucien would definitely be taken as a boy
ah, ok
But it's from like...oblivion
and the correct awnser was?
I am a girl
mmm, tell me, am i the only one who guessed it right the first time?
pretty much
so idk
But yeah, most people think I'm a guy at first glance
Whether it be from my nick or personality
most people think i'm a girl at first glance here
that's because of your nick
nicks say a lot of things about people
yea
other than my gaming tag
What is your first impression about my nick?
I don't game so I wouldn't know
First impression?
mmmm.......
Acsendant, as in Playfully, understanding, Intelligent, Freindly......
and do i smell a little shyness?
ahahaha
That's slightly funny
Actually that's really funny
it is?
But well, it depends on how well I know you or how I feel about you
yeah
You see, if I don't know you very well and I don't like you because you're annoying
I can be rather cold towards you
well, thanks
XD
XD
If I like you or you're one of my best friends
then I'm more of what you described me as
funnily enough though
That's the meaning of my nick
touch√©
derp ;p
your nick obviously is some sort of oxymoron
well not really
but yeah
light + umbreon
mmmmm, comes close
now you try, guess what my nick means
-!- No results found
/me mauled
okay I mean
well, from the first glance of your nick
I would say you're a...
caring, cheerful, optimistic person but also a little mysterious at times
almost
derp
want a hint?
sure
don't freak out, kay?
!define autism
-!- (psychiatry) an abnormal absorption with the self; marked by communication disorders and short attention span and inability to treat others as people
what the-
why would i freak out at that lol
I have a lot of friends that have ADHD or are autistic
There's nothing wrong with that
you're just like any other person tbqh
you sure as hell don't act like it though xD
i know, but why say inabillity to take others as people
xD
well
nothing wrong, but that isn't me
as long as you don't use it as an excuse
I'm fine
nah, it isn't an excuse after all
I hate idiots who use ADHD or similar as excuses for their unintelligent behavious
erm
behaviour*
let me name a few
There's a few but I'm braindead atm
lol
and I have no idea why I'm being so friendly today, either
me neither
heh
usually on this network I hate on all the newbies
why is that? are they so annoying then?
yep
okay, XD
I just get easily irritated at those sort of people
usually I'm indifferent
but it's a different matter with them
sometimes, i am too
lol
okay I need to go
so I'll be back in maybe 10 minutes
if not
in about...9 hours
Okies, Bye then
o.o
Mmm toast.

hiya Quan
7Hey, light.
7Don't you wish we had a reset button around here?
03reset button? o.o
why?
7Topic.
ah, i see, not really paying attetion on it, it's not my buissness
i think
Ah
Nah
Life goes on
7True.
03god I swear though
We're just leaning
03Articuno must have turned her friends against me :/
...
03she was all "My friends don't want you there"
learning
03referring to her private chat
03I'm like
03what
its not that they've turned against you
Its just...that circle
Yes
But instead of being here, its somewhere else
03what circle though
03all of the UK members I thought were fine with me
Same here o.o
7Hmm.
It's not that they're against you
03ugh, it's not really TST that has changed, but Articuno :/
Its like me and my channel
7I'm sure this is a dissonant time for this, but Arti might as well be a figuratively literal Broken Bird.
I don't let you in there
03well that's because the people on your channel aren't really friends with me
03also LOL
XD
03now that I'm a server admin I can technically get on any channel I want and set myself as an op
/me hides
Not what I was getting at
03but see
03I won't
03because I'm not that kind of person
Its just having a circle, and then if someone isn't that circle its weird
7o3o
03EW THA....OK I'll hold myself back
03but seriously why does everyone need to have circles :/
That's life
03I mean, I PM lots of people but it's not like I'm gonna go make my own group of friends
7It's human behavior.
03in fact I tried once
03nobody joined. LOL
7You know cliques?
03EW CLIQUES
03I avoid them like the plague.
XD
Again, your opinion
Oh goodness
But cliques happen
03did I ever act as if it wasn't my opinion>?
03I love how people keep pointing that out
03Yes I know it's my opinion, what of it
Probably your timing
03k
We should all just make a thread with all the circles created and the users in them
But that's a 100% bad idea~
Um...that's stupid and probably impossible
I mean theres obvious circles like mine
sooooooooo
rawr
And then some that are not obvious
Um no
No
10o.o
These circles are blah anyway
That's my point
Circles aren't just friends
Its a group
Which can overlap with other circles
Timing much
Yes
hi HML
what timing
We were talking about you
Sorta
Anyways
About friends and circles
Oh
But why kinda me XD
/me hides
LOL
lol
13Why did I think of something naughty with that comment
Circles happen, their openness varies
A bad one if most
03the people in the middle are the AWESOME section
13!floof
13!floof
13!floof
I'm in there too 8D
03but yeah honestly I can't stand cliques
And yeah....venn diagram is a good metaphor here
13I love floof
/me huggles
03well
03it could just be me.
03like
03my friends aren't friends with each other
03so I can't really make a group even if I wanted to.
Its not really a clique though
03plus I prefer talking to people 1 on 1.
Its just a circle
03I wasn't the one who used the word clique originally.
03go blame Quany LOL
I know lol
7D:
Yes
Bad Quan :(
Just stating the difference
/me gives her a punishment- No Tropes or YT for a week
7Apologies.
13brb Lugias
brb food
Cliques are usually groups of people who are the same
7Hmm...
Circles...people can be complete opposites
03Also LOL circles
03I keep thinking of the movie I Now Pronouce You Chuck and Larry
LOLthat
That movie was weird
Though, I didn't see too much of it
Heck, circles can be just 2 people
It's just natural, there's nothing weird about it at all lol.
03two points is just a line
I guess with them at the right position, they can be in a 360* XD
03:P
03or a 69 :O
/me hides
XD
Bad :P
As long as people don't go all OMG UR NOT IN MY CIRCLE YOU'RE NOT COOL or something.
Of course.
Wait, isn't thayt like the same thing?
03isn't what
If you close up the 69... nvm
Back to the main point..
03that's a 180
03not a 360
Hmm, well I guess a circle of people would work then
03LOL
"Hey gaiz, lets just lay on the floor and make a huge circle!"
03LOL
03yeah well
03this is not the place for that but there is such a thing ;o
And Espeon, you're not cool enough to join my circle ;P
Yes ;3
/me killed
The thing is, people want the inner circle gone...
Imo, the inner circle is all of us who know each other
03gah that term circles
03too confusing
Yeah .c.
03because it could mean anything
03whatever
Back to what espeon said, just keep open to new people
Could we just use "these people who perfer these people over these people?"
Circles won't be a problem
Its not preference lol
Really, the only way they can be a problem is if people get a feeling of "I'm inferior because I'm not part of that circle"
But I've wasted too much energy on this topic
Just be friendly and things will be alright.
03well
Indeed ;(
03Espeon, that or if the circle goes "You're inferior if you're not a part of this circle"
03:P
Well then they should get a life
:3
Oh Espie, you're a genius

http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6744.msg258244#msg258244
lol
Someone explain to me what I did lol?
Wouldn't call it an attack.
But at the same time I can't make a "Calling that a x is like calling y a z" joke
:<
XD
That was the same person who's been raging about this whole thing, wasnt it
well not exactly an attack
Yeah
apparently Sunny went and PM'd Skylands
about it and wanted the topic 'closed' because it was 'dangerous' and could 'destroy the site' or something
Lawls
I probably should have deleted that one...
it was completely irrevelant anyway roflamo
roflmao*
That post if yours was the one from the new topic I merged
Of
I suspect it was posted in my new topic
As were the two post after it
because Sunny was like to Skylands (when it was locked) "Thank you yadadadadada:
My post was the first back in that topic
ENORMOUS POWERS
done
okay
oh yeah
lmaaaaaao
Lets make Sunny a mod and see what she does to the threads ;p
And I'm kind of confused why people can't just read the fact that it's time to move on and look at the future instead of the past.
because most people hate change
I do but I've gotten used to it
Used to handling it
derp
hah
I wonder if she'll think counting to 1,000,000 is dangerous too...
/me floofs up
oh here we go
Anyways
"Makes me really sad that when a few members and myself are trying to save this forums from an evitable demise due to a topicas dangerous as this, you just send me a reply as poor as this, when you have enormous power in your hands that many would kill for, while you seat there and refuse to use them.

03Stupid fundies
03I swear
Fundies ?
03those people with the "I love Jesus" crap in their signatures
It will not be pretty if I'm dragged onto the computer again
Lol XD
03makes me wanto to kick them for no good preason
03-p
". I offered yesterday to Skylands to create them a forum at a free host so the ppl involved on this issue could bite themselves to death if they wanted to, and the rest that dont want to have a ping to do with this didnthave to deal with this"
03especially because they tend to act all whiny as we can see from his postings :P
lolol drf
those
/me would say something, but he'd better not
03see
03i'm not even being mean
03it's kinda a well known thing
what espeon said
lol at Charizard El Latino's part of his post there lol
Yeah
"forum at a free host"
lol
03well when they have it in their signatures
How
03it's already rubbing it in your face
Uh, no.
They just say what THEY believe.
drf, you have no idea what the meaning of "annoying signature" is
If it said "I believe in Jesus and will NOT go to hell because of that"
just sayin'
then we're talking
XD
03I'm not saying it's an annoying signature
lmfao Xeli
drf
03go say the words fundies to usotsuki and you'll see what's bad about them
/me hides
It's your fault that you get offended!
03er word fundie
Lolwaht XD
/me BA DUM TSCH
03I never said I was offended
03annoyed != offended
No but really, I just find it really odd xD
But we all have our pet peeves of sorts~
squeak.
<Espeon> It's your fault that you get offended!
lmfao
Hah
03stupid Jehova's Witnesses and whatnot
Oh joy
implying I don't know
I'm annoyed to the max by fundies too
03I'll just say I'm glad we're not allowed to talk about religion on here
03yeah
Same
03I'm just saying people like that are clearly fundies XJD
03-J
but having "I love Jesus" in your sig is not the same as going from door to door and sticking your foot in it
!define Fundies
RRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWR!
Jehova's Witnesses?
Hmm
;o
heya
?
I had a JW friend
03Espeon, it's not only that, it's the whole "if you're not afraid to show it copy and paste this" thing
Hmm.. hard to explain
I'M MEANT TO BE DOING MATHS HOMEWORK NOW NOT BEING ON IRC
okay
03that's just trying to spread it around which is what funldies do best
03-,l
I'm doing business homework
I'm very tempted to reply to El Charizard Latino's post
03s/reply/flame ?
But it'd probably end up as some sort of mini-modding or whatnot
reply, not flame
03orl
03y
Someone just has to say If you have nothing constructive to add to the thread, STAY SILENT
something along the lines of "okay, stop this seriously, we're sick of it and we know what we're doing"
well Xeli, there's been a number of times I've wanted to reply because I think someone/something is wrong/I don't agree but I've kept silent
because it doesn't have much to do with the actual thread lol
Maybe
Then we're two.
Lol.
Or maybe seven
xD
true
heya
662 views on the thread in like, 2 days hahahaha
that's just sad
Sneas :3

So many page refreshes
LOL page refreshes
Xeli
remember Dragcave
and the macro thing we used to refresh the page to get more views? lmfao
I still make it my missions to post the same thing whenever people say "Cilck mah dargons"
Usually in all caps
no one cares derp
:3
Obviously.
Heya Beto
Because cheating on the internet is unthinkable.

I keep thinking back to the days when I first met you...
What was your opinion of me back then, Xeli?
03LOL @ the dragons thing
03I'm all for having links in your signature if they aren't annoying ones
Click me ;D

meh ><
I never delete messages myself, but I seem to get little spam for some reason
03well

13Esp[eon
gijinka? wat
13Espeon

No comment..
gijinka, basically a costume based on a pokemon design
Ah
02Whew
don't say that
you sound like an indo >:(
no I'm not racist
Phew
Now.. what was I going to say
13WHEW
13WHEW
I've just had enough with dealining with indo abusers at GeekBouncer
dealing*
stfu >:(
gijinka of Mismagius
ah
if that helps any
school blocks DA ^^
:D
hmm
Hmm
then again it blocks TST and other sites I want to go on
so I just proxy
8D
13got a Lugia gijinka
So fail :D
wait that might not work
How many catgirls were there?
h Aurora
that actually worked
XD
LOL
well that's DA's image server
not DA itself
Fail school :D
lmfao
02Dunno if I can though
schools fail
oh lol
"Chat MAY be back if one day it's good enough for my site again, as of now the servers are "unofficial", you can get any of the info on how to connect by simply asking around with some of the regulars :>"
Articuno posted that in the "What happened to the chat and pea pages?" topic
6I'm going to speak with her about that
6but first I also need to speak with kyu
Fun
/me falls asleep
6and see that the rest of the people can actually agree to what's been said
/me kills Kyu first
/me puts SG on his back\
6o.o
/me snoozes on Shiny
xD
well
we need action instead of just talk now
I miss her too.
/me puts on the One Piece gloves
we hopefully have passed the talking part
Luffy :D
it's the action we need now
I mean
We need a conference :(
A skype conference
6we HAD a conference
6did you not see-
6oh
6lol
6no
._.
Yeah, bad plan anyways...
So, step 1 in action should be?
bring the chat page back onto the site
but we need Articuno to approve of it...
6no
6step 1 would be what the admins decide on
Bring new users, get them excited and make new frien-
Ah\
6i'm sorry, but this is where we take over now
Well true
I got a couple of those, yeah
but I think we should bring back the chat page first
If Mr. Sleepants comes, then sure
just a suggestion
6continue posting suggestions in the topic if you want, but the first step is putting the admins and mods back in control
yeah that seems to be something we're lacking atm XD
control, really
Indeed
Later, redo of rules
6ok
/me yawns
6stop
6let us decide
class afk
/me yawns
6on what to do

6I'm actually going to attempt the 100 OC challenge to check how many I have
You
o-O
Of all people XD
was that directed at me or Aurora?
02Didn't you have to make up more if you ran out too? XD
6I dunno LOL
You
XD
6but the thing is
6while I don't have a lot of self made OCs
Why would I not have OCs, HML? XD
6a lot of pokemon from my games I consider OCs
That's the point
I write fiction remember
Haha, that
Reminiscence, To Cross The Line, Road Of The Lost Soul, TRoHR
hm, what else
TRoHR is technically a history fic but in my style but okay
I was mainly speaking about in RP/Chat
Ah, I don't RP
6I used to RP
Wolf RP?
6the two RPs I was in are dead I guess
6no
At least not anymore...I might do forum RPs but not chat RPs
6I'm in Dragon RP
6which needs to live
Ah
If you check the RP board you might fight some of my old RPs
I used to be in the Dragon RP too
Yeah, I saw it once in RP XD
I kind of rp, but kind of don't.
DUN DUN DUN
But I can't remember whether I dropped out or just got banned
Xeli you do RPs in PM...
O.o

Black socks they never get dirty the longer you wear them the stronger they get
/mauled

._.
02http://oi54.tinypic.com/2yttx1u.jpg
02No idea either
lol
02I only have an account on tinypic so I can find images I uploaded from when I first got it
oh XD
I mean tinypic has a captcha and that's alright
02Then I can go back to shtuff I uploaded 2 years ago and say "How did I even manage to mess that up?"
whoooooo O:
cool: O
+a
02I got to see the Skorupi he put up for sale

02Yay people
02:D
A..
Mac..

With.. Jap.. text..
/me is still having trouble with them
yessir
good man
you knew it was Japanese, not Chinese
:'D
/me will only say one wthing
Boo
shush
02Lol
XD
it works for me, and that's all that matters
02Why boo?
s'my comp C:
XD
02I don't get why it's such a bad thing
Well, just be lucky it isn't as expensive as my desktop
XD
02Again, why not? :P
I don't either, Shiny
I mean, I seem to always make computers run really slowly
but that's not a mac problem XD
It's me eating the CPU
Orly ;P
02Yes
XD
Well stop running so many things at once XD
butbutbut
I always have like
music
02Multitask
and art
I do
and email
and word
02It's good for the soul and brain
and firefox
:'D
Sometimes art and email
02Keeps it working
EW FF
NO wonder
XD
Get like Chrome
lol
I just hate closing things lol
02Why?
02FF is nice enough
I bet you'll notice it'll be faster
02Should see mine, it has Luffy :D
Like, FF is a memory hog and is slowish XD
hey, I switched to FF after getting a ton of junk from people about Safari and Camino
02Hey, IMO better than IE
actually Camino just sucked
Ew )fur)Persona
and I'm lame, I don't want to download more stuff
XD
Laame
so, HML
THEN WHY UPLOAD STUFF
What's so bad about it having Japanese text?
No
02I have FF too, so yay :D
Upload ‚â† Download
:D yay
/me clams it up
I wasn't saying anything bad about the text
oh
XD
Just that text on a mac
Looks WEIRD
o3o how?
Black and silver doesn't match
‚Ä¶?
Well, for me XD
02Oh well
what do you mean?
02That's your opinion
what silver? XD
I mean that's just a strange combination
The silver Mac OS Gui system?
02I think that's what we call "White" now adays
/me yawns
uh‚Ä¶
Really o.o
GUI?
you mean the shell?
Aka the window you can move about
Shell o.o
‚Ä¶ oh that
Well, weird mac os/Unix term
So guess XD
haha, X11 isn't really‚Ä¶ MAC
Error is a bot btw
My bot
:D
But shell, I'm thinking of DLL
hmm
Goodness, those things
explain DLL
*define
A DLL is Dynamic Link Library, most Windows thing
‚Ä¶
clarify, please? :D
See, programs load Data from them to run like Direct X 10/9 DLL ( AKA. Graphics software)
DLLs basicly are needed to help windows run/load extra things for them to use
ah
They can also be used for new features
Like OpenSSL.DLL
I meant "shell" as in the casing
Yeah, but Windows Shell and Mac OS Shell are different
I'll just use shell as in the windows/boxes for the programs
MMM.
ah
‚Ä¶ the physical casing
Not really physical, but it appears on the screen
03mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
‚Ä¶
LOL
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
/me runs
Who?
/me hops
/me chases
Murr :3
/me flails
02Twinkle twinkle little star
no, I meant the physical casing. You know, the thing that you see
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
/me flails away
Hahaha XD
DDDDDDDDD":
Slightly Confusing still
Shell could also be a command window that does non-gui taks
*tasks
ah
/me hides in Shiny's fur
lol
Heh
/me sniffs
02<3
I wish I was on my comp

berlf
03!anagram jkhgui
yep
I am beginning to lose interest again
I don
*I don't blame you
so how is everyone?
Squeaky high
Pokemon just does not capture my interest anymore
I am sort of "meh" about the upcoming generation
I am dead
You?
so very bored
14It has actually resparked my interest in pokemon
not me
:/
I am drifting away yet again
Same
yep
Toys r Us is going to be better for the BW prerelease
nothing in Black or White I find interesting or appealing
http://pokebeach.com/2011/02/toys-r-us-black-and-white-deal
I can't justify buying a copy
it just seems like a waste of money
this is just like Johto to Hoenn for me all over again
12headache
(I'm currently a bit high, so idleish)
04I DID IT
04X________________X
04god that took a LONG TIME
You did the burd is the word song O.o
hay guize
12hi
I will be totally ignoring stuff
/me rubs on Umbreon
I will not even know when a third game would be released
if I decide to quit
12murr
There might be wheathins on your 3FZ and Blueeraspheyy versions
04heh
12i wish i knew formulas for excel
Mm..
04:V
JKDGH
I will never buy another Pokemon game AGAIN should I decide this
(with a "warning" sticker this big you know they gotta be fun!)
They did it D<
That's what Luke Skywalker said before he nearly got run over by alderrann
I need to track this ost down now
>_>
Who's the gh-ost this time?
can I beat someone up with them ?
well
04[23:09:06] <&Aurora> They did it D< <-- who did what? :3
the only part I get any joy out of is the increasingly distant past
last year they released a "best of 1997-2010" soundtrack for the anime
but a lot of the music was stuff people aren't as familiar with
Gotta buy/download them all it seems o.o
so they released volume 3
*2
More hm o.o
with like all the songs from kanto
Wow
no
the game
C:
I expected that to happen
04:O
so much fun
/me is nommed
the Pokemon anime dipped in popularity after the fad ended
04I envy you for knowing Japanese
04D<
especially in late Johto
ehehe
04so
04that script
04how is it
I should've done this half a year ago :'D
04|3~

THIS IS MORE FUN THAN I HAD WITH EMERAL
04INORITE
D
what do you mean?
/me high-paws the mousie
/me highpaws
Umbreon
04:>
I just learned how to do that stuff
Emerald was too little too late
so that is not saying much
12lol
04I got the fan translation :V
lopl
04.
04Emerald was fun
04shush
04:3
12i want to create a formula
12that will add up an entire field
The Sonou City gym is full of people in waiter's outfits
it's amazing
B'D
04I know LOL
lol
=SUM(A1:E5) example
No matter what Emerald > >HG/SS > Crystal > Yellow > R/S > DPP
Aero likes maids
But that is borked
I like people in uniforms in general :'D
04And it's the first gym to 1have different leaders depending on your starter
04...........
04FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
:D
SO
HARD
12what is A1 and E5 like i know they are coordinates
04I meant to block that out lol
lol
A1 being top left, E5 being bottom right
04actually not with a monkey
04:>
lol Spoilered
04oh shush you
I have the monkey
12would E5 be like 5th field 5th row?
04it's the first gym
yes
but I don't want to use him until the second pok√©mon
12ok
DPP was the worst generation by far
04nobody cares about the first gym
04|D
on the top and left side it has labels
'cause he keeps getting critical hits on my lol
On your lol?
*me
14LOL
XD
12sigh
lol. LOL.
I SHOULD NAME MY NEXT POK√âMON LOL
12i guess that formula doesn't work with microsoft works database
04Just wasn't the MOST fun
Pt was so much fun
04:P
I agree
Mehish
I think alphabet is column and number is row
04HGSS
04<3
I've already got names ready lol

WHY
04XD
...
04Nice name
WHY DO YOU KEEP GETTING CRITICAL HITS
XD
14...
04I'm not naming Zoroarak
04erm
04Zoroark
04because I like that name
I never name
04:>
All I saw in that was like
Zo roara k
04XD
6^
6which is why I did that picture
o.o
XD
6of zoroara
Mind control
04rofl
I remember that
04butbutbut
04Zoroark = FOX
no buttd
04you = WOLF
04species change
So
04:o
‚Ä¶
how is it a fox?
14..
wolfies
12works on openoffice spreadsheet
12sigh
04who knows
14lol
I dunno
6it's a fox lol
04It's the "illusion fox"
6but I also did the fox thing too
12i would be using open office database but i don't understand it lol
04In Japan the "Monster Fox" I thinl
Fantastic?
oh that
Soul Silver actually rekindled my interest for a while
i'm really not quite sure what you're trying to do
04LOL ROARA
this "database" stuff is throwing me off
‚Ä¶
geez, mom
04wannabee Aurora
no need to get angry
/me runs
:T
LOL
12i'm trying to make a list
All I said was that there's no bag in the trashcan because it disappeared
Who's your mom?
OLOL
and that was tuesday
Bad
not monday
12of cards along with quanity
12and i want a cell that will add up everything that is in the quanity field
which is trash day
hence
no, you did not pick it up
12so i know the total number of cards
/me throws them back with added RAEG
is there a little button at the top
that has the sigma symbol
?
/me loves DRAGONS + 1 RAEG
12not that i know of
/me gets a Happyness + 444
12doesn't matter
/me leaves
bbl
Seeyas
12i didn't want to use a spreadsheet because then i can't sort them but i don't really need to sort them
i know in excel there are ways to sort them
/me finds a random dragon and uses it as a snuggle pillow .c.
12hmm
also, make sure that it has the equals symbol
12it does
like "=SUM(blah:derp)"
6Snivy, Swoobat, Zoroark, Sigilyph, scrafty, and chandelure is my team for most of the game I think
/me uses MATH and snuggles a gryphon insdead
uh
12it says the formula contains an error
o.o
Un heya>
6since I can't get my Deino until WAY later
can you copy the formula?
6and legendary is late too
04.
and show it to me
I see
12=SUM(D1:D17)
odd
.o.
:E
which version of excel are you using?
12i guess microsoft works just doesn't have it programmed in
Want to snuggle my gryphon?
12it isn't excel
Also Roara thank you for telling me what moves to give my tean
I've never seen a legendary
Team
/me FLEE
or a shiny
or the Elite Four
well, uh
Wow
wait, I have a shiny pichu
You must of like..
but that's it
12i had the theory though that they are alike and so that formulas that work in one would work in another
Never got past Gym 1
and I didn't catch that
12but i guess they aren't that close together
i don't see why microsoft would change it that much

6and probably one of my favorite pokemon anime songs ever
12apparently they did though
try looking for something like formula wizard or something
12no go
or, can't you save it and import it into openoffice?

12i found this
12so that has me really confused
I've gotta reset this laptop again >.>
maybe make it not all caps
like =sum(blah:derp)
12no diff
hm
like i was saying, which version of this are you using?
129.0
the link you posted was for 4.5
12i find it unlikely that they would remove stuff in an upgrade
yeah
12stuff like that anyway
but microsoft is probably dubm
12yeah
12oh well
lol
14Well, goodnight everyone

Ah
It's not a hack
It's an RPGMaker executable
6it's not-
6yeh
Hm... I wonder how that'll work out
Nice
I mean, I played some kid's RPGMaker version of Pokemon Silver before SS came out
It... Sucked.
:c
Hope this doesn't :3

12:<
6also, <3 catch effects
Pretty well done effects indeed :)
But I do have one complaint...
What?
The speed is kind of... Sluggish on some parts
6yeah
6that's ane xtremely old video though
6from early last year
Hope they sped it up
6if you look at the newer ones, it's more refined
6since it's still WIP
Got a more reacent gameplay footage?
K
I really have high hopes for this thing :o
/me runs
6LOL
6I have high hopes
6since all 4 japan regions + 1 custom are being added
Oh nice~
/me 6punts HML
Yeah
/me eehs
Rofl
I was gonna type that Roara :P
But k
Also hm
You're not starlit
I wonder what the new one's gonna look like
Or where it's located
Since most "hacks" are areas based off NOTHING
or edited versions of other regions with is :c
This guy seems to know what he's doing though
6he's got a team there, and it's nice seeing they're about halfway done
It'd be cool if his new region was northern Japan and the Sinjoh ruins were accessable (even though they're closed off)
6yeh
But seriously
Pokemon is NOT INVOLVED with the upper mainland of Japan AT ALL |D
Is it really that boreing? *flees*
6well
6Oblivia, Almia, and Sinnoh are north japan
Sinnoh is its own island
6but if you mean the north/west shore, then yeah it's not been used there
I meant mainland
6yeah
6the north island
6oh
6almia and oblivia are technically mainland I believe
6the northern tip
Oblivia and Almia are north though yeah
Yup
lol i'm fighting with little jenny over a doughnut
...Where the heck is Fiorre though? :V
(sp?)
i'm gonna solve this argument with a knife
6um
and you can relax i'm not about to cut her. i'm gonna cut the doughnut in half
6I had this all mapped out
6in one of my 100+ sketchbooks
12sigh
:c
K
Bree~
LL hi
o.o
6I believe I wound up mapping fiore on the southwest
Oh?
That's farther from Almia and Oblivia by a longshot :P
The only living ones, IIRC, were a cat in concept art and a dog on the cover of a book in Season 1
that has ALWAYS been done
Yeah
the very first region was based upon an actual area in Japan
same can be said with up to Shinoh
Isshu is the first to not be based on Japan
What, do you eat Pok√©mon now?
/me runs
That's
*That'd be sad tho :x
4-10 working days
6I think I mapped fiorre in the kinki region
6whch is south
/me loled at the old hack video series he used to watch
Connection fffffs :c
But.. there was one particular one I can't seem to remember/find
6I think I mapped fiorre in the kinki region
6whch is south
Heh
6http://www.t.soka.ac.jp/chem/CEJ2/JapanMapII.GIF
the Johto Journeys box set will have some redundancies
as it contains Orange Islands episodes
6kanto is kanto
6obvious
one of the redundancies in terms of episodes is a favorite of mine though
6johto is chubu
Ahahaha
In Blue Chrome
6although, orre is on the west edge of chubu
You can wear Red's outfit
XD
...Or does that change your "skin
?"
6wait
6nvm
Like, you turn into Red if you wear that outfit
6I think orre was in chugoku
And Gold/Ethan if you wear his
6technically, it changes the sprite, but the idea is just the outfit changes

and i realize how truly mediocre i am
.
OI

we got into an argument about the swearing shit
yeah I did Lullabye
but your stuff is also awesome
you're like Shiny ._.
you think too lowly of your work
damn thats cute

They look oddly comfortable
the lack of descipline and my weaknesses show through too much in my work

especially when i try to do detail work
Stop thinking your work is shit
It. Is. Not.
xD
i know its not
its mediocre lol
=.=
im happy with my simplistic designs

if by python dies you're complaining about how it flops quite readily, use try: except: statements on anything liable to fail
ex. with a file-open command try: <open the file and do stuff with it> except (list of potential errors) as error: <error report using variable 'error' as the error statement>
XD
Bed
Zzz
true
seeya Aurora
Python can be fickle though
but C and C++ are worse...especially C++
I've also learned always do "with var as open(file):" blocks rather than the normal method of accessing files, as the normal way won't release the file if it crashes while it's open.
python is delicate but there's ways around where it breaks down
yeah
C++ makes me rage
python on the other hand doesn't
which is at least something I can give credit to it for
bbl piano

python is being very successful at making me rage at the moment.

I discovered a weirdness with the 7809 voltage regulator
it seems when you have its output going into a 7805 it causes instability to programmable oscilators
the issue caused a wavering effect in the carrier on the AM transmitter and also resulted in the 25 Hz stereo pilot tone fluctuating a bit
so its back to crystals when I want to run full power

I have GOT to play this one on the air
the weirdness factor of not hearing this on 1134 KHz would be priceless
so its AMIP, right?
no
its this custom script created by a PocketMonsters staff member
for Foobar2000
its designed for mIRC so its Windows only
hmm, does it work with winamp?
no
Foobar2000 only
hmm, could you send me?
I suppose
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=2DCIN9WG
thanks
lemmeguess, did inu give that to you?
yes
that might be my KasumiAMP alteration
oh, no its not
that is the original
ahso foobar does it via a file read
which is more robust than sockets and DDE server
correct
but more HD access
DDE can be touchy but it works
cuz my wimamp & MIRC config atm,
breaks on UTF8 FLACs
I have never gotten it to work either

Hi
Updating my r√©sum√© with a new photo of myself
The previous one was maybe too sucky
none replied
._.
o-o
So I got a new one
The old one had me smiling like evily
And I was in a t-shirt
no good
So I took one again in more formal wear
And I didn't even try to smile, because usually that fails
Oh yeah
I bought a CD-R to burn that image of Worms 2 I downloaded also
So no more need to insert some random CD in there when I play it
Also
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-qkNEampEA <- Some swearing, but funny
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Bye Cqis.
I am on 157 channels, across 16 networks. I have 10 olines, 90 ops, 7 halfops and 17 voices. I have non-abusive power over 837 people.
/me hidse
157 channels?
now zzz
157 is still ridiculous
I'm on 22, two of which are channels I use only for testing bot(s)
XD
Ah
I'm on a lot of networks though
ten channels per network is similarly ridiculous
I have an average just over four

xD
14sorry about that
14I was trying to get island.lugia.us to work
right, problems with the PC?
try tst.lugia.us if it didn't
14only ocean.lugia.us will work for me
/me chews on a pencil
today is jenny's 1st day back at school since the wreck, i figured she should arrive in style... or at least in something fast lol
14I tried the other two, but neither is working for me
\o/
How fast could it be if she can only go 85? :P
i haven't managed to top it out yet
What's your record? :o
170mph
xD
I haven't gone faster than 90mph in my SUV :P
xD
Don't think SUVs were made for racing
Even with a V8
i don't think the are either lol
*they
How do you have all this spare money lieing around? xD
Buying sports cars and military weapons
this and that :P
i paid $500 for my car

But, Drf server works for me
HML, are you sick?
Slightly
14oh wait, let me try this
ouch, get well soon
not alot of investment for what i got in return eh
14sorry about that hml
14hope you get better
That does sound pretty nice
I paid $8 for a brand new copy of Halo Reach with a wrap on it
nice
Don't even have an Xbox 360 xD
Just didn't want to pass up a good deal
i've already beaten reach tho. i got all 3 different endings
there's one ending where noble 6 doesn't die
14I'll brb
:3
it's just really hard to get lol you have to survive on the last mission which is basicly just holding them off as long as you can for an hour and a half
after an hour and a half you're picked up by some stragglers and taken off reach
14I still koined ocean.....

Woot... I've finally and completely deWindozed a 122-key UNICOMP keyboard.
And it costs absolutely nothing (to the price of the keyboard).
12attention customers, Umbreon says hi to whoever is here
14hello there

Okay... I'm mildly bored before chem lab so...
For any one interested in playing with some really easy to get running retrocomputing stuff: http://upload.cetafurs.com/adss-km.zip
Okay o.o
I've made a very simple (and dumbed down) distribution of the Advanced Software System/Keyboard Monitor for the PDP-9.
Unpack... and just start the exe... on windows as I put some batch into the auto booting INI.
How'd you backspace in the window XD
And what commands are there?
Ah
Heya Rora
12hi
Vanilla ice cream and peanut butter is legit stuff
12too much fat
Perhaps
Still good though
An easier way to keep the "help" text on screen is to add the line "SET CONSOLE TELNET {port number}" into the pdp9.ini file somewhere before the RUN statement. Then connect with hyperterm or something.
12a weird trait about me is that anything that is high in fat usually tastes awful to me
12i hate bacon for starters XD
Sometimes I wish that was me
12i remember having that KFC double down sandwich
12that tasted awful as well XD
Ok well
Stuff like kfc that's basically downing in fat
Tastes gross
I still eat though lol
12lol
It would be easier to use if I could even backspace and edit XD
Delete equals backspace... sort of.
delete is backbackspace
/me cough
The thing is that the PDP-9 wasn't built for video terms so the RUB OUT key on the teletype sent out the ASCII delete code, which was interpreted as "delete the last letter."
So if you made a tipo\\\ypo your lines of kode\\\\code would start ooking\\\\\\looking like this.
But yes... I must go. Time for SCIENCE!
(Also known as a chemistry lab.)
YES!
Baaisz
and hah, delete -= s on there
/me rolls on the floor

Oh
Hi

oh this is funny
someone reported my post as silly
albeit it sort of was
but that is actually really funny
oh, i heard he did that with more posts from other users
Its more of just not knowing
yeah that person is not native english
Yeah I know
I wasn't really trying to make fun of him lol
I know, but don't be making fun if the report either
Of
Okay
04http://www.serebii.net/potw-bw/497.shtml
gaaaaah
04HOLY
I feel like killing my internet connection
tongs :(
cbf to load it, what is it? o.o
04Perversity <3
Serperior
wait what is this
Oh wait, english names or something.
04Serperior is officially the best starter
Not like that means much.
I mean
YAY
oh Serperior is a starter? /fail
It's Jaroda
I can accept tsutarja, but calling it snivy is a crime
What exactly does pervetsity do
04Moves used on the Pok√©mon that raise stats lower the stats, while the moves that lower the stats raise the stat
Oh wow.
....lol wow
04The only thing I can see that blowing up is with Swagger
04Because then you're actually confused AND weaker
04Everything else though is pwn
Ah
Too bad that's gonna be dream world stuff
04true
04But
/no idea of 5th gen
So technically it doesn't exist
What she said :3
04When he's released in the dream world, you'll be able to get a freaking tank
04It doesn't exist
04YET :P
Yeah
But theres a couple hundred other pokemon with dream world abilities
We'll see
thongs?
Also fail at the dream world
hmmmm
Because of the server crash at japan bw release
We wont have dream worldfor a long while
Faailss
;.;
But whatever
same as yesterday, only you
I'll be to busy with the rest of the game anyways
crap I need to update my PO client >.<
THEY NEED TO LEARN ABOUT PATCHES
...the game, lost it
aww
damnit
04hahaha
04anyway
/me runs
04Pok√©mon is apparently HUGE in Japan
And what do you think will happen here lol
04it's not as big
XD
have you seen the preorder sales?!
04Besides, they'll hopefully up their servers knowing what happened first
Internet could go out at any moment!
04Compare the preorder sales of BW in the US to Europe and Japan
04Who has the most?
04erm, had
04I bet you anything Japan had more
;o
Xeli
nu, tongs
Pokemon Online
Perhaps
need to learn
about patches
/me also hugs on HML
-.-
/me hugs on Quilava
But our sales will be more than enough to overload the system again
I'm not too bad, he
*heh
04Nintendo'll probably have a more reinforced server to handle another wave of logins at the time of the US/EU release
Especially if these are all running on the same system
04And since Japan had more orders/sales, I can assume the Dream World is going to be safer here
Since yeah, both US and UK
mm, still, get well soon
did you know that the EU release is two days earlier than the US one?
04well true
04But
You need to consider
04since the UK's getting it first..
The population
Japan is anal
04They'll have everyone log in immediately
...small
O.o
04and then-
04.
o_O
04WHAT
wat
04WHAT TYPO IS THAT ROFL
wat
How did you manage that.
Yeah
Il burn my phone now
xD
04XD
XD
Its a swype type
hah
Its easy to typo things
/me RUNS
derp
That was horrible
XD
why is that not in the badwords lol
well
Ill switch to keyboard
doesn't have to be but lol
04because anal retentive is a term
04:P
true
LOL
04And yes I know Japan's small. However, they have more people in small areas.
But yeah, japan is a fraction of the US population
04It is?
04Really?
I want to compare the sales
04I thought it was more o.o
...
Absolutelynot lol
04yes I know
04small island
The US has like 300 million
04But IIRC, most of Asia is populated in many areas
so 127 million is a "fraction" of 300 million?
Lol wut
Population, that is.
fraction means a piece....
Like, less than?
Well sure, but usually you hear it used when it's like smaller =P
Lol
Well
That is less than half
Also
I think I'm horribly wrong about US pop
897

Same XD
Well
both of my comps. are plain black
If you hate that
03and really, it's what's on the inside that counts (Yes I know I used that line in a different way) - so I'm like... a 500GB hard drive is a 500GB hard drive... why do you need a fancy picture on it?
i hate non plain one's
03yeah, my computer is plain black

03I need to cancel
03er
Maybe your mind is trying to tell you to love gen 5 .
03I need to cancel my BW preorder at Amazon and re-preorder
03because
Why?
Why is this taking so long to fund
Find
03now, if you preorder, you get a $10 Amazon gift card
Djxfn
03so I can get each game for $25
03rather than $35
nice
And looks like game stop will be the failure this time
03EW GAMESTOP
its the one place without a bonus
03I refuse to set foot in that place unless absolutely need be
03why not just use Amazon?
03You get release date deliery
Except the wall clings, but that's sioux
..stupid
03so you get it at your door when it comes out :P
Stupid phone
03inb4 sioux phone
Lol
:–∑ / :–ó / :3 / :¬≥ / —î: / E: / :–≠ / –Ñ: / :—ç
hi Sneas
I'm semi tempted to cancel my preorder with gamestop, but at this point its not worth it
03I'd say do it
03you can get each game for $25 on Amazon
03which is totally a better deal than Gamestop
03plus no tax
03free shipping etc
03LL gets annoyed at me telling her to buy online too much, I'm gonna do that to the rest of you too :D
/me hides
too bad theres no post on sunday lol
03true
03you'd get it on Monday
is it still sunday over there?
03no
03we're talking about when Black and white come out
oh, right, time zone mashup
03though you know
Hi
03I will seriously laugh
03if I get my BW's on Saturday
03it's happened plenty of times before
Lol
03they use UPS 2 day shipping so they ship it 2 days before release date
03but UPS decides to be nice and delivers it after 1
I wish I had my reciept, id cancel today
:3
03of course, I won't be back at my dorm until Sunday anyway so it's pointless
But its fully paid for and I dont have time
This week
03but I totally want to take a picture of me holding the box for B/W on Saturday saying SEE I HAVE IT AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU BRITS
Lolwhat
They get it friday

03that
04That's a fair estimate :P
Class ugh

03I thought there was only one version, and it had the swearing in it o.o
yay the fleet is issuing a new type of missile ^-^
no
there is a radio edit
censored
03what's censored
03?
03the version I have from NOW 6 just plays the word backwards x.x
03which is stupid
:O
Who are you
g**da*n nights and getting h***
?
03yeah, the one I have just plays godd*** backwards
03but it sounds dumb
03the one you have actually mutes it?
yes
03:O
03Can you upload that for me?
I suppose so
03www.sendspace.com
don't want to make an account
03given the bitrate, I'm guessing you ripped that yourself?>
03you don't need to
03just hit upload o.o
I did
03OK
it was direct from the music video
03ah
03wait where'd you get the music video?
03I didn't even know there was one
Youtube
it was an HD version
03oh
with AAC+ audio
03just give me the YT link then
03I can extract the audio myself
i wonder if he knows we're getting new ordinance. he hasn't logged into freespace yet today
I can't remember it
03hm
03the VEVO one only does 480p
03ah I hear the "god" part muted
03kinda lame still but :/
I suppose
03does yours mute the whole word or just "god"?
I would have to play it again
03LOL
03whatever
03can you just upload it for me?
but you see the thing is the neighbors might be able to hear it if any of them listen to AM and tune up and down the bad
*band
03XD
the new missile has a 3million km increase in effective range ^-^
http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/9420/img0250sb.jpg
because of this
03LOL 9V battery
not anymore
I have a 12 volt battery pack
but am back to using a crystal for frequency control
but the perk is the higher power add on works now and the range is about a quarter mile
idk if they improved the laser warhead or not yet but more range is better
10oh bullcrap >>
even if they didn't improve the warhead i'm happy with my new toys ^-^
if I had a better receiver I would record the on air stereo signal
10suddenly my computer is infected with one of those virus software alert things
03you know, we actually do have an AM station here that plays music
03but the quality sucks and it's not my kind of music
/me yawns loudly.
;o
We have a few

/me runs
10DRF, I have a question
03yeah?
10Ever heard of AntiMalware Go?
:O
03no.
10Because it suddenly popped up and yeah >_>
O.po
10Prods me to scan and crap
03yeah it's defintely fake

10Didn't work
O>O
03you're screwed
Try shutting down and loading safemode?
03try just forcibly restarting your compuer then
And I weigh like an earth elemental.
03or
03wait
10eh
03try typing in mIRC
10if I restart
/run cmd.exe
10might not be able to get back on IRC
do you know anyone that might have a rescue disc skylands?
10no, Nick
Bah
like kaspersky or whatever?
10No, Nick
03meters
03<Skylands> eh
6Sky--I recommend system restore if you haven't.
03er'
03> /run cmd.exe
LOL
it does work
Amazing
03System restore does absolutely nothing against viruses
Bad idea SL
10Yeah
6Does for me.
system restore probably wont work cos the malware will most likely embedded itself in that particular section or whatever the term is
03did it pop up a command prompt, Skylands?
Well then, you're luck
10Where do I type /run cmd.exe?
......
/me barely knows computers
03same place you'd type /me whatever
Like in MIRC text box
03you type it in mIRC
03yeah
10o.O
YEAH
it works
10Same message
epicl
O>O
03:/
Gah
03then you're screwed.
10Well bullcrap
So...
SO malwarebytes
whoa, it blocks cmd.exe?
10All because I went on Bulbapedia
03it probably was something else
03be like me and blame Apple
/me hides
/me sighs
03well
Then I guess the malware remover things are on lockdown so =<
Well... an idea.
ooh we're getting an improved version of the screamer ecm missile
03my sisters had a very similar problem
03we had to reformat
you got it off bulbapedia?
If cmd is being blocked...
Why not try the older more aging one...
10Idk, Nick
COMMAND.COM
10but that's when it popped up
O.o
hmm
03* /run: unable to open 'command.com'
Maybe?
10when I was viewing a page on Bulbapedia
03then again
03doesn't exist in Windows 7
Yeah
Oh.
Sadly
I had one I got away by downloading a removal toolkit but I've heard the newer ones block virtually everything so =s
/me uses Windows XP
10and that did nothing
Good
ah
Well
Win7 killed th 16-bit stuff so there's no way to get COMMAND.COM on it then.
(XP has it though. :P
windows xp is a severely vulnerable OS now
03actually no
03it's only Windows 7 x64
03the 32 bit one still has it
Can you try a notepad doc?
Ah
so drf, does iT 9 work now?
I <3 32
go cmd.exe
03hm
also sky what browser do you use?
It doesn't work .x.
03well I'm trying to think
:O
Firefaux?
10Firefox, Nick
Hah
http://myfoodlooksfunny.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/funny-food-photos-foreleg-weak-i-wanted-a-kicker.jpg :D
Hi, LightLie!
03there IS a way to fix that virus problem
03hm
03Skylands is your Firefox still open?
10yeah
03you can load pages with it?
Can you downlaod?
hmm surprised FF couldn't detect a common malware problem like a fake AV
10No
the r&d guys are giving us lots of new toys today ^-^
There is always a way to fix a virus problem.
Ah :|
eek i'm not a boy
most browsers has some form of protection nowadays
It's called reinstalling Windows.
You should of gotten malwareytes .x.
03yeah
she*
:
03OK so
10The bad thing is
:O
03Skylands, here's what you can do then
10my dad won't fix it
03Reboot, press F8 when it's starting up
10after the last time he quit
03screw your dad, I prolly know more than him
/me hides
I just use Avast! becuase it's free... and all you've gotta do is just renew your free license each year.
03anyway
Safemode :|
03no but see
03not JUST safe mode
You are about the same age so Panda's flirting is acceptable.
03Safe Mode With Networking
10reebot internet?
03that will let you get online
Witrh networkng
Yea'
03no
No
03rebooting Internet doesn't do anything
PC
Box
http://myfoodlooksfunny.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/funny-food-photos-tot-sized-pizza.jpg Woah.
03Skylands, reboot your PC, select Safe Mode With Networking
reset the OS he means
like shutdown and F8
03that should let you load mIRC and stuff
03but
or safe mode yeah
Down arrow .c.
03you should then be able to run Firefox
03and download/instlal Malwarebytes
10dunno where to locate the select safe mode or w/e
03run that
03F8
F8 on bootup.
i want it!! it looks so yummy ^-^
03reboot and just keep pressing F8 until the menu comes up
:O
A small menu
Before the Winlogo.
Or before the BIOS
Finishe
*Finishes
03no, not before the bios
03that'll just cause keyboard errors
Ah
/me checks the calender
After POST is complete, and the disk drives are recog'd.
still 15 for a few days
It'll black out for a sec
Then when it's listing the I/O ports - i.e. stage 1 bootloader - you can star stabbing the F8.
:O
/me is 14
Fail
XD
Mace away!
:O
It isn't too hard skylands .o.
=p i'm still older
Okay... killed the wrong application there.
/me yawns slightly.
:(
03Nick, I know the virus, my sisters had it
10Nick, is just says to "scan" it
jokes
Same
03it's really hard to get rid of
My mother's PC had it
03Malwarebytes will work... IF you're able to run it
I got rid of it since I had MB and safemode+ Net
03the best way is to rename mbam.exe to something else
you know youll kidnap someone some day <3
03actually
03you know another way that works?
03make a new Windows user account.
03then install Malwarebytes on that
03XD
03It sounds dumb but it works
LOLwhat X
oh
/me lights a cig
so its not the kind of fake AV that forces you to pay money to 'use' it
Yay booze and gasoline!
?
/me drinks both!
You know what'sm dumber?>
/me lights a spark
I installed a Windows 7 partition JUST to do that XD
seattle
10LOL
10"34 threats have been found"
1034
Ah
LOL
Fail
but he is barely here
Together they are even more terrifying
XD
Yes!
10Meh
10If I'm unable to get back on, expect to see me using an iPod Touch app known as irchon and stuff
Okay
03just reboot into safe Mode With Networking
03that's all you need to know
But you should do that first..
I bet she'll forget :|
o.o
i accidentally closed the tab
X-Chat is starting to act twatty...
Yesh
?

03bbl
yeah i do

they are the future :)
yikes

o.o
u.u. i cant get any here though
stupid Canada
Okay, I think it might co-operate now.

whoa3*
Seems to be working correctly now.

:O
o-O
now what, drf?
Welcome back.
he got me to go intov her channel
if yer really sweet yer bf can be canadian ;)
Jokes
porn
One could try the blindingly obvious plan of attack:
ohai Quilava xD
/me eats all the awkwardness
hi
How are you?
Do you have a REAL antivirus (that's not Norton)?
kinda meh
Maayve
no
Ah
WB Skylands
>:
I dont have any lol
Download malwarebytes
because the ones I did have were all BS
Okay... THAT'S the source of your problems.
Want a direct link?
and avg free
;(
Avg is bleh
no HML
I have a solution
I'm using iPod
Stop using windows
So the plan now: Open browser, go to google, get malwarebytes
certain programs could not be picked up by AVG without malware bytes and vice versa in my experience
That's so solution
Skylands*
BLAH BLAH BLAH
Only real one is to stop clicking every link ;P
And then GET A BLOODY ANTIVIRUS! (May I suggest Avast! ?)
Skylands, live boot into say, Ubuntu
Retrieve your files
no Internet connection
wipe windows
She can't download it lol
put linux on
:{D
go buy one then
Nah
it's like $5
Ew
Go just try to fix windows
problem is with Linux you are shut out of around 99% of mainstream productivity applications
:Like 90% of her old stuff won't work on bawnixz
...
I'm not preaching lol
so I guess I'm screwed
Yes
Well, possibly
Well Skylands
Do you know what virus you have?
HAhahaaha.
I told drf earlier
Okay, so if everyone is done with the Linuxrage... can we get back to trying to help?
and it's AntiMalware Go
can't remember the name
04heh
yeh
:o
04drf's here
04erm
Wow, it looks awkward in here
04no
04frack
also yes what Credeki said
04D:
There are some bad mac viruses now ;O
I'm gonna leave you alone now xD
Skylands: So you can't get to any websites at all?
>scrolling up
/me sings and watches the whole channel die
>CGI:IRC
>no
no
04wow
04That sucks
04x_x
04The virus is doing that?
Query: Does any one know if mIRC supports DCC?
hm
Skylands.. can you try msconfig?
Yeah
Most clients support DCC
Just glitchy for some servers
04Wait
:)
04Skylands
*clients
Well, proper IRC clients
wat HML
04You can connect via IRC?
04WHat?
and there is the payback ^
I no speak computers
Skylands is on her ipod
iirc
XD
04bit
04*but
04she was on mIRC moments ago
yeh NS
xD
<3
Can you use run
/me pokes back
let's see
yes
like type /run msconfig.exe
i wonder if i can practice my singing so i can make people's heads asplode when i sing
Can it pop anything up?
yeah
Here's an idea? Why not just DCC Skylands the Malwarebytes installer? (Solution.)
Good, then try to go to "StartUp"
Well, the installer might be blocked
ok
on startup
/me and his genious ideas
No harm in trying.
tab
Can you look for the virus' name?
04hm
04Skylands
As in ..wait a sec
04I got this thing called iPhoneBrowser
huh
04You can browse and load files into your iPod
Ah, move down until you seee AntiMalware GO if it's there
04Doing so, you'll be able to back up your data
I don't need that
04k
XD
04If this'll be fixed via HML's meathods then that's great :3
XD
yeah I hope so
04what's so funny HML
04:<
otherwise I'm stuck on my own
I had a similar virus on my vista PC
04:/
i wanna try freerunning sometime
Not funny, I was on another chan .x.
04oh k
freerunning?
and me with computers themselves = bad
vistrash
Yeah..
look it up
04^
047>vista
04obviously
linux > windows
so HML
some ppl call it parkhour
anyway
startup and..?
04not helping :3
But, what chan you see in the scrollbar/window?
it's proably easiest just to format your comp
ah
046
after retrieving files
04*^
04yeah
well
04which is why I suggested iPhoneBrowser
I'll list what it says
BSD lol
I somewhata agree ;P
I've only ever used BSD with servers
drf's server runs off FreeBSD I think
But it's still Linux > BSD > Windows > OSX
04BSD > Windows > Linux > ??? > OSX
/me flees
Linux > BSD > Windows > all apply's crap
OPINIONS EVERYWHERE
^ yeah
AND
NO
FIXING
Linux is awesome
OMG
QTTask wat
?
Can't remember what that is
Quicktime LOL
The only place I'll say Linux is better then BSD... is when there's no BSD distro for the system. :P
OH RIGHT LOL
For some I bet Linux sucks, for some it's great. Same for Windows. End of that.
/me 6blinks.
stop with opinions plzzzzz
6^
I need help >>
Don't make me kill you with logic.
I parody freerunning occasionally when jumping off 6 meter high ledges ^^
Linux the IBM System/390 and IBM z/System
But, might want to try the registry editor.. later
doesn't seem to be anything out of ordinary
6Was about to present in a slightly looser tone, but:
Skylands, do you have a windows disc?
lol
nice ^-^
04yeah
heya
It is only like one and a half meters to the water though.
She said no I think
:p
Dont think so, NS
okay well brb
04[16:36:15] But anyways, yeah, if you have iTunes (EDIT: no, iPhoneBrowser), I think there's an option to view the iPod Touch's file system
04[16:36:27] That way you can back up anything you wish to keep
04[16:36:44] Then you can actually reformat your drive with the Windows disc, if I'm not mistaken.
Skylands: Trying to DCC you the Malwarebytes installer.
04huh
lol
I can't exactly ask either, dad isn't home
04.
http://www.precisesecurity.com/rogue/antimalware-go/ this seems very similar to what I did when I got one years ago, and it worked o.o
04Skylands is on iPoh
04Pod
04:E
yeh
mIRC is dead o.o
it would download to the iPod not comp
Wait, yeah
:/
So, no FireFox at all?
USB cable time?
Hm
It's not a download though, it's a step-by-step thing.
I wonder if it disabled the internet too
actually cutting a computer off from the internet is a good idea
I'll TRY system restore, though it's bound not to work
because most viruses and pretty much all trojans "phone home" in order to function
Okay, good luck :|
well cutting a computer off from the internet in the event of an infection that is
Yeah, it was especially fun for when I went skinny dipping there while basically unconcious.
04Espy
04That link
Yay for drinking myself to auto-pilot
04It might work :D
04try it SKy
Vodka does not go well with beer....
04also System Restore doesn't do crap :|
on my iPod?
NS :3
o.o
04No
/me huggles
XD
well
04I mean on your PC, silly
04|D
:O
I went in safe mod
Hai *says it kirby style*
e
true that man
and Internet doesn't work
I think you did it slightly wrong o.o
04...
/me has redbull and beer
04You need safe mode with networking
Did you select with networking option
that is like a killer in its self
04it's a different-
BIG
04haha HML
Difference
which is why I cannot install whatever those bytes were
04skylands
LOLM XD
04with networking
Skylands: Did you go to the networking optioned safemode other wise... well your interwebs will not work.
k
Well, that is why we can't do anything
04:>
So, reboot
F8 and press down
04Yay problem is closer to being solved
derp HML
Then once you highlighted "Safe Boot With Networking" and enter XD
The worst thing was that it all went down in less than twenty minutes.
something I feel good about knowing XD
ALTAIR
and Sneas
dajfshdf
/me hugs back
04|D
Because I pretty much took a sip between every sentence that I contributed to the conversation and every now and then when I didn't
See, so much easier if you do have internet XD
system restore is almost complete
also Altair, I somehow managed to type drf as Altair
The rest of the night I was lying on my back, occasionally mumbling something in an attempt to contribute to conversation
From what I have heard at least.
system restore is something windows just does not survive without
XD
w00t
Fell onto some pile of rocks somewhen
That night
I can get on
lol wut
XD
Hiya
for now
Yay?
Only scratched some skin luckily.
6For now?
Well, when I had a similar one
system restore worked for a limited time
Now download MB lol
so don't take anything for granted :3
ok hang on
system restore is glitchy but anyway
I wanna get back in mai
The next day I was basically spending the whole day in bed.
afk
mirc
brb
No hangover at least.
lol
04k
XD
The limbs were just not very easily movable.
Whee
wb Skylands
XD
10ok
So, seems like we wasted 10 mins on no networking
04hi
Whee :D
lol
/me wants to do that
10Espeon, link?
Hey Skylands
but my mom would murder me
Mah boi
10ty
drink yourself into a coma?
04http://www.precisesecurity.com/rogue/antimalware-go/ <-- this one?
got your comp fixed?
that's not a program btw.
But there is a link to a removal kit there somewhere
probably does all that for you.
10then yes
http://www.techspot.com/downloads/4716-malwarebytes-anti-malware.html < Lawls
Almost
there it is
lol
cool
/me clicks
yepp
My internet is dying
sounds like fun :)
10Done dowloading
lol
10Now what?
Install and run?
10:P
Plus update
You should do that to MB too XD
(Once it is on)
did anyone read the book that was then, this is now?
that is a REALLY strong book
lol
no, like its about this hippie
and he runs away from hom e
he gets high just on weed a first
10Should I perform a scan?
and then hi hangs out in this hippie house
and he gets on acid
Yes, perform a scan.
yeah
windows likes viruses
a lot
and he finds out that it was his brother that was selling it
XD
and then the hippies life gets screwed up
10quick or full?
the guy calls the cops on his brother
FULL
Full
I'd go with full Lol
its because Windows is popular
and he goes to jail
Durr ;D
and Linux is not
acid will do that
derp
yeah
same with BSD
04mew
Macs can get viruses too~
/me will never get high
(on acid)
well macs are...lol
Same ones as windows too ;P
/me will
Obviously. It's not that Linux is like immune against viruses, it's just that less people use resources on a minority =P
:O Acid
?
10Probably the first time system restore actually worked
04Espeon
just not on acid
yeah
10So yay
04Such minority is for geeks
or meth
6Wallah.
Very
im fine with weed
That's a stereotype lol.
eew meth
iirc there aren't a lot of viruses coded for linux
04Geeks don't have much to take except computer parts
derp
and lol
weed? where???
my teacher was like "linux is an old geek language"
04theifs do not wish to take computers; they want their IDENTITIES
04XD
Because fewer people use it as I just said lol
and I'm like "loool"
huh?
i know a place where people always sell
i've got a hello kitty bowl from japan ^-^
the funny thing is, its right beside the police station
LOL i should!
i need to clean it sometime
:O
/me wanst s
wants*
dead
My profs all detest Linux. :P
but that book - some powerful shit right there
crap*
/me pulls the chat back from the land of the dead
:S Sorry Arii
Good :3
1036k scanned, no infections thus far
Then I have two that were "born, bred, and raised" on Bell Systems UNIX TSS 10.
heh
And the other was a BSD boffin.
10or zero changes to 1
36K is nothing XD
D:
/me jinxed it
10D:
/me cries
and suddenly INFECTIONS EVERYWHERE. Happened to me.
I had like 300,000 files on my PC to scan
/me hugs Ari
took 30 mins XD
ya know yer my bro
I had like
g
actually probably more
/me hugs Sky :3
10Unlike you HML, I probably keep my computer space clean
It would probably LOVE my 2 TB of pwn. :P (Sorry, 3 TB of pwn now I've an external 1 TB exposed to Vista.)
and I was like "stuff there, cbf to do anything about it" and wiped windows off lol
10:P
lol
What did you to it ;P
this*
the fact that they are so big on Unix is interesting
Oh mai, my laptop is very clean
especially since it was restricted to minicomputers and mainframes for the longest time
Windows 7 64 on a supercomputer for gaming = profit
unix is awesome
Well, the two on UNIX TSS 10 are rather... old.
droid
D:
04heh
i don't like blackberries
And the BSD hopper is more in the middle between "desktops everywhere" and "minis + terminals are the shiznit."
/me has the torch
i hate butt dialing
/me has a dumbphone of ancient times :o
At least it takes pictures.
butt dialing??
04lulz
dialing with my butt silly
80% of the TAs however...
Well 80% of the TAs are Mac users.
19% use Windows
ew ;)
Pictures like this! http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/20832_1212026240873_1835297489_395903_3622942_n.jpg
And the other 1% uses Xubuntu
lol Xubuntu
Of course, that is Facebook resized, but the point remains ^^
lol
That is the place I go to swim actually :3
lol distro #9000
terminal is awesome
thats pretty cool
ooh where is that?
terminal > cmd
anyway
is that is ethiopia
?
"Why the hell are you using Xubuntu?" "Becuase my PC is a piece of 01,01<bleep>."
elbonia?
Xubuntu somehow reminds me of Archlinux
No, Estonia :p
XD
Then get a better PC
dunno why
Northern Europe not Africa.
lol
They're a TA. Do you think they have money? :P
right ;)
and doesn't xubuntu use KDE or something? KDE is a nightmare lol
What's a TA ;P
http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/35573_1213257911664_1835297489_398624_3654885_n.jpg
Kubuntu uses KDE
yeah
EXTERMINATE√ü EXTERMINATE
Xubuntu uses xfce
KDE is a bloody nightmare
I like KDE.
Ah right
Je deteste Gnome.
Look at those bohemians! http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/11452_1096414390649_1835297489_190168_2003990_n.jpg
Gnome isn't too bad
xfce is meh
let's try that again
KDE is...just...lol
Though I kind of liked CDE. :P
heh
√àxt√©rmin√§t√®
/me pokes Sneas to PM
EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!
I dunno why I'm using Linux Mint
ethiopia has its own language
?
XD
Though, interestingly enough... the only Linux I do happen to enjoy is Debian.
linux mint 9 isadora which uses gnome
debian is ool
cool
I have only used parted magic XD
That was decent
I like RHEL, Fedora and Linux mint
and debian
I've yet to try solaris
Mostly because I find it's not as "user-friendly" (read "made for people with low IQs") as the *untus.
no
have you O.o
XD
omg!
Plus it's the only thing I've got running on a System/390 mainframe! :P
ubuntu is meh
lmfao
:)
i'm watching it right now :3
imo BSD is the best for servers
(It's also about the only affordable software for an S/390... if you're a hobbyist.)
people seem to like using centos for servers and I'm like "ew centos" lol
CentOS is a pain
"I'd like to run MVS/390?" "Twenty-five thousand dollar, yearly license." "!!!!!"
x.x
haha
That's why mainframes for hobbies... aren't fun. :P
ah
Unless you like hacking obtuse IBM code to bork their license thing.
LOL
And you find a company that'll let you "error check" their install media...
haha IBM lol
I have no clue about Ethiopia, never been there.
WATSON
;o
My school uses ThinkVision/IBM computers
wait ThinkVision is lenovo
Eestil on loomulikult oma keel, ja murdeid jagub kui murdu.
I swear they use IBM though lol
Which used to be IBM. :P
ah right
correct
that sounds just about right lol
1050k, 3 infected
Parted Magic is LXDE lol
And hah XD
10Now brb, dinner
until IBM sold their PC division around 2004
Which folders sky?
10brb dinner
10Hm?
BrockU uses Dell, Dell and more Dell.
10I dunno yet
k
10It's not finished scanning yet
My school has Dell and Lev.
10As said previously, brb
Dell isn't too bad
That was a semi-joke
funny considering that IBM developed the modern PC model in 1981
Back in the 70s - going by the computer history exhibit - BrockU used DEC and HP.
and now they don't make them anymore
The IBM PC was nice.
Power PC XD
The PC XT was... interesting and a good expansion.
heh
The IBM PC AT... was a godsend.
tummy ache T_T
the PS/2 really pushed things further forward though
The IBM PS/2... was a nice boost... and also a gigantic failure. (Hi MCA! Bye MCA!)
And the IBM PCjr... was hilarious.
that was just a failure
Er go why I said it was hilarious.
true
The IBM midrange systems were pretty nice as well.
Poor army want a belly rub :o
/me mauled
._.
.c.
Though I really wish to go back in time and slap the designer of the IBM System/32 upside the head repeatedly...
bbl
bbl
Mostly becuase of... reasons unknown to the world... the System/32 - start of the midrange boxen, and ancestor of the AS/400 - made the 5250 terminal.
hmm
Estonia has its own language?
Whereas the mainframes used the 3270, and the PCs didn't exist yet.
If the S/32 used the 3270 one wouldn't need three different terminal emulators if one is working on multiple IBM systems and non-IBM systems. :P
Yes, as I just said in Estonian.
Basically every European country has at least one language of their own.
huh
not england ;)
Right, because English and the various other languages in Great Britain are not their own.
<.<
EXACTLY!
what are the other langs?
huh
lol
dont use mibbit
are you on windows?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Great_Britain
i'm on my phone atm
:O
04hm
do you have a windows comp though?
04Anyone know what reversed hex looks like?
2 lol
Not really
04:/
04well
04I'm trying to mess with loop points
huh
my laptop is broke and my other compy is only for gaming
you should get a shell and just run irssi off it
04And apparently atthe end of each track, you can loop by adding "94 xx xx xx xx"
or just install linux on one of yer comeps
comps*
eeew linux
04the 4 xx's represent where the track should jump to in reversed hex
i'm a windows girl
04But... I'm ignorant as to what the format of reversed hex is :
04:E
:O
have ya tried linux?
/me flops on Shiny.
i accidentally dropped my laptop and it broke or i'd be on it
=)
04unless it's something like: 89 0A F8 00 (normal) -> 00 F8 0A 89
/me sprawls out under Espeon
02:3
04Just wnna make sure it is that
My comp = my laptop = my server are all running off linux
04Sninyyyyyyyyyyyyy
/me hughughughug
/me licklicklicklick
02Hey Sky
10Heya
02Hiya Shiny :3
02Hey Ray
10Thanks HML
10I restarted and it's all good now
hi Shinye
10It found 3 trojans, removed 'em
Shiny ;D
Hiya :3
Breat
*Great
02Hey SS :3
6Nice.
:(
Skylands: Now that it's gone, I highly suggest getting thyself an actual antivirus.
10Any suggestions? Free ones preferably
http://www.avast.com/en-ca/index <-- Avast! free
I'd just keep MB :|
AVAST
10MB?
OVERRATED
10Oh
What you just used XD
10Nvm, abbreviation
02Better than nothing
02IMO
But very much functional
02Hey Quil~
HML: Who cares if it's overrated if it gets the job done?
02Sorry I didn't see you say hi ;v;
10MacAfee is the last one I had
02Exactly
10It was a waste
LOL MacAfee
Baad
I had to kill it from my laptop
10Norton years ago (before it was proven to not work)
I had macafee on my XPS700
My old high school used MacAfee...
The techs loved it.
Because they get paid per maintenance call. :P
/me lolols and thinks we should all ask TG to tell us about antivurs </carcasm>
And typo
/me only has MB on his PC since he rarely uses it
10CARcasm
But yes Skylands, just get Avast (and register, it's free... and you need to reg it any way (whoopdeedo?).)
eeew linux
I don't like any registering
(=) (:) E:3
E=3
Heya Skylands :3
Doesn't avast have popup notifications?
10Unless things become hopeless
That's what disposable e-mail addresses are for, HML. :P
Skylands: No, do not hold off on getting an AV.
rose tyler just died :( she was my fave character
Problems get solved before they happen if you have an antivirus that actively kills the virii dead.
What's going on?
Skylands, Avast is kinda slowish on startup XD
10Meh
HML: How do you mean on startup?
ooh the hunt for red october :D
You mean booting the interface for a scan? Or on system bootup?
Or is that AVG
Skylands needs a antivirus?
On system boot
10No, GL
10I never planned on getting one
Like loading windows and startup stuff XD
XD
Nope, doesn't seem that bad on bootup.
You don't really need it
(Going by my grandfather's mildly crap P3.)
10Don't worry, HML
Yes, you do need an AV.
10I'm not downloading it either way
I'm a linux girl
No, MB shall be fine enough!~
Only morons, and mac users don't have AVs.
....
Do YOU want to be a Mac user?
You're calling
Me ... a mac user?@?@?@?@?
ooh she's still alive :D
That's worse than calling me stupid!
:D
(Since I dislike apple ;p )
10The only Apple product I like to use is iPod
I wish I could be a cute girl for like a week
10So shush
I‚Äôve tried over 13 (free/1month) antivirus programs, and the only one that works is no antivirus and Norton 360
10Norton lolwhut
Meh, whatever...
10Norton destoryed my computer
10destoryed*
10...
My box always has an AV on it. Becuase I prefer not to deal with virii ever.
How?
10destroyed*
Hmm, whats your OS?
10By not doing its job, HML
lol
Even a day would be interesting.
10Windows XP, GL
XP
So I let it, and its firewall make sure I don't get virii. :P
Of course, that would mean locking myself in a room for the whole day <.<
I have XP too. FireFox does the job
I've never gotten Virii on my laptop nor PC
FF is meh
(And if I do happen to get one, it's promptly removed from being functional before it can DO anything. :P )
Firefox is good.
I should get my virtual PC a virus
/me lulz at the fact of her virus causing all of this debate on which antivirus program is the best
FF is slow and rather small in render sizings
I'd probably go after a guy and a girl then
Plus, I hate the download manager
You have a virus sky?
10I had one around 20 minutes ago
What is it's ID?
10Thank god people at TST know their stuff to assist me and my computer
Aka DRF and Me ;P
10Can't remember the name, GL
Ahem.
10I mentioned it earlier
And you
Too :3
Well, my personality would still be horrible, so I would not even waste the time.
Not too important anyway
Was the virus called Windows Defender?
LOL
Hhaahahaahah
NS: It was "Antimalware GO"
lol
10Looking back at logs
10it was called AntiMalware Go
I just said that. :P
I have windows defender XD
/me is afraid to get back onto Bulbapedia again
Why?
u got virus?
10Cuz that's when AntiMalware Go came
Don't all Windii have Windoze Defenderp installed automatically now? :P
:3
Durrrurr!
HML, theres a fake windows defender that finds and attacks your computer
I had that on the vista
yep ^-^
Naturally... it's the one that comes on the OS distro disc. :P
BRB phone call.
OMG AntiMalware Go attacked my computer before I had Norton
Mkay
What happened to it?
It makes it super hard to go online
And play games
10What does? Norton?
No, that fake
No, AntiMalware Go
10AntiMalwareGo didn't let me access anything, so yeah
When I got it I could not go online for anything
02Ah, AntiMalaware
02Got that a while ago
My vista PC had over 130 viruses
I loled hard
02And?
/me doesn't get it
It lived
:D
02So did mine :3
And when you think you got rid of it. It's there
I had Antivirus 2008/07 on my XPS 700 x.x
02I've had no more problems with it
It was horrile
02It's been 3 months now
*Horrible
It was the piece of crap McAfee that gave me it
Never get McAfee
It don't work
02I have McAfee
02Don't use it
02But it's just there
02Hey Roara
~
/me used to have McAfee
10as stated eaelier
10earlier*
02Yes
10also, when my mum got a new laptop
10Norton was automatically installed on it
Eww free Norton
10I told her to remove it, she didn't
squeak
10but w/e, it expired a few weeks ago
Sueakes?
Free Norton is cheap and never works
o.o
The only Norton that does work, is 360
10Regardless of the type, I despise all of it

It slowwwwws my computer down
But hey, I have no virus XD
EW THAT
that's what destroyed my old laptop
6and several other of my friends' computers
What came is this? :o
Saame X.x
descent freespace
I saved my XPS 700 from it
THANK YOU MB
6but the thing is
6I've no idea how it got on there
6we wiped the computer
6and there it was
6right when we restarted it
we've only got 2 divisions that have recieved the new weapons so far in the fleet :(
Skylands, go to ‚ÄúAdd & Remove programs‚Äù and see if you can find AntiMalware Go in there
10Why should I?
10Malwarebytes removed it
It‚Äôs ID is that of a program
10I don't see it listed
hm
Then yeah, just use Malwarebytes
6so yeah
6I've found an interesting link between people with horrible typing skills
6and college students X.x
What is it?
6online courses are hilarious, because the kind of typing we consider "noobish"....is the most common kind of typing in my class
6all college students, most above the age of 22
Be careful though, there‚Äôs a chance that it will start up your computer again, it will start up
14lol
I doubt it
6grammar errors, punctuation fail, no capital letters, spelling issues
04AURORA
04I successfully cracked looping
04:D
6one person actually writes like "i need 2 eat rite to balance my diet"
04:DDDD
6I'm like =+=
6=_=
lol
04so now
.x.
13Ew bad typing
14LOL
04or get one
04and BWify it
04and have it loop
04:>
6ANGEL
04Win?
/me 6asplodes
6also
6that's glorious
04Indeed
13i don't even shorten words when texting, I'd much rather spend an extra 10p of credit typing my texts in full than shortening all the words to make the message shorter :B
ANGEL :D
04My theory was correct
My parents killed me for getting that virus, lol
heya Zephyr /late
Haha heya
04See, the looping is controlled by being (usually) at the bottom of a track
No worries, I respond late all the time
XD
02:U
Saying ‚Äúwhat kind of sites are going on‚Äù
XD
02Btw, I don't think it's NS's birthday anymore
Oh lawdy
04The loop is pointed out by starting with 94, and has 3 strings of hex in Endian
04AKA reversed hex
Though my birthday is tomorrow. :P
04It ends with FF, signaling the loop point definition is over
</random>
you+
04So I made the loop point somewhere else
14my birthday is today
Lies ;(
13FFFF how did I not notice that
;o
13Happy birthday :D
04It's funny: you can actually make the songs sound very, VERY screwed up if you make the loop point not where the other ones are
hAPPY BIRTHDAY TR
02FFS
6lol
14thanks :)
14thanks
02I hate it when it doesn't just reconnect me if I've been disconnected
04But that's not what I'm trying to do so
02Nope, have to type something so it can tel me I was disconnected, THEN reconnect me
1314's my favourite number, so make sure you have a good year xD
04I'm gonna have to find a way to identify when I should have the song loop
04hm

Scrambled word is "osmrhcrpacnucaicuelo". To guess at what the word is type !guess (Your guess here). Type !hint, !hint2 or !hint3 for a hint.

7I was sorta curious because of y'know, my sprite.
hi and bye
squeak?
10o.o
6ocean totally crashed didn't it
o_o
6anyways
Ocean is back up
6this new spyro game....
6is horrible looking LOL
k sorry
I just had to reconnect
there's a new spyro game?
6yeh
Ocean is back up
6Skylanders
6http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2011-02-11-spyro11_ST_N.htm
spyro looks...O_o
10Nice to know they're using part of my username in the nest Spyro game
heh
XD
XD
10I might buy it for that reason alone
O.o
LOL
and yes, ocean failed
Ba
6the design
6looks horrible LOL
10Spyro looks mutant
^
derp
they killed his look
o.o
10I was already upset when they changed him once
10Now this...
tbh I wouldn't even know that was spyro unless I was previously told XD
Okay...
there we go
I believe ocean.lugia.us just crashed.
Are there any other SSL enabled servers in the network?
6I actually liked the designs for the last series
02[17:37] <Skylands> 10I was already upset when they changed him once <== Same
6with cynder and all
02But well
6granted....they looked horrible until the 3rd game
n.n
02Lol, I liked Cynder, and the story was all right (except for Sparx who I can never get that horror of him out of my head)
derp
ocean has been very unstable recently
I'm now on ocean again
Naturally it's back up again, I've connected via SSL.
If anyone here uses/wants IPv6 I'll prod drf to ask if I can install it
04Ugh
well, get it working
04Anyone good with coding hex?
I have my reasons for thinking ocean is way better then island
;o
I want IPV6 XD
lol hex
Personal
because drf manages it? lol
Can't say XD
well it's very obvious
Don't be evil
04Are you good with it?
04:P
I didn't know of the other two servers on the network, nor that they had SSL.
Now they've been added. :)
04Because this right here is annoying the heck out of me
about a week ago
04Format is (0xAABBBBBB). A2 = Track number, B6 = Track offset (RELATIVE to the start offset)
when nest was taken down...
oh lol that
hex ew
I'm not too bad
but it's annoying
04trying to find the track offset
04yes
04well
04trying to find the track offset so I can later edit it
04but here's the funny thing
04The track's offset is already confirmed to be 00 51
Ah
!lag
lol
04But the code is 01 57 07 00
0401 is the track number
!lag
Hm
0457 07 00 is the track offset
!lag
[Kosovo] Lag with ocean.lugia.us is 1.576secs
04but it doesn't make sense endian or normally
12no meow
Anyone over 2.075secs D:
!lag
04Relative to the start offset... What does that mean :/
!lag
uh, I know a bit about hex
but not THAT much
XD
04:<
04Thanks for trying to help anyway :P
I tried to learn hex XD
!lag
[Satoru] Lag with ocean.lugia.us is 1.123secs
sorry
!lag
I nearly painted a picture using a blank .bmp ;p
;o
Wow only 0.218secs
Sexylag
Which is funny becuase my first lag still hasn't gotten a response yet. :P
!lag
nice
University paid for T-brillions are awesome. :P
I will find where Ocean is located and ping when I'm connected directly to it ;D
heh
HML: Directly connected as in connecting from the server hardware? Or from a box on the same switch? :P
iirc ocean is on a dedicated server
Middle-endian...
When one half of the word is big endian and the other half is small endian. :P
04hm
island is on an IRCd shell
04wait
04what
04WHAT
a stable IRCd shell mind you
iiiinnn
04well it's only 3 bytes
04how does that work
Hm .c.
04so wait
Try 2^24
Then you'll see how ;P
04it's suppose to be 00 5F 07?
It's three bytes... but if the three bytes are a word...
O>o
005 F07 are the word halves. :P
Oh no.. words..
04ugh
6yay
Hmm?
!scramble
6just bought shrink film paper
04http://llref.emutalk.net/nds_formats.htm#Sounds <-- This is where I'm doing my research

Arti got rid of it just like Nest?
iirc Altair is better at scripting mIRCscript than I am
Only different is probably that I can be bothered to script lol
MSL's not too hard
Yes
You could pick it up quickly
Didn't you notice? lol
6um
Even by messing with existing scripts
6irc.lugia.us IS nest
I stated that irc.lugia.us no longer existed multiple times
Oh, lol
Should we add a thread
Or, add to chat topic?
That was stupid of me XD
*** Can't find irc.lugia.us: non-existent domain
no
Articuno already knows
She says this network is not the official thing anymore
I mean for the other users XD

6TF proofs D<
..wow
that's my idle time on another network lol
02So... the Idle Master/King/Ruler/etc... is Samui?

6then you have permission to be afraid
02o.o
02...
Who?
04blh
04blah
04HML
04You know any C++?
02O_O
....
.....
02...
.
noooooooooooooooooooO
04.
04:<
/me runs from it
04because
02I NEED THIS GAMEEEEE.
GET.. IT...away..from..mee...
04this program that detects there- lol
6yes I need this game
There are..?
04this program that detects where the track offsets are
04is written in C++
6current estimated release date is march 13th
And compile?
04and it has this
04hold on
02<33333
02Neeed it
02but I wonder... will my BAD pc support such amount of EPIC?
6and then touhou 13 has been announced
6the demo will be available at the next con, which is the 8th...?
6and then yeah, as long as the pattern continues
6we'll see touhou 13 in august
6I still need fairy wars though lol
/me is back (gone 00:18:16)
6I also need phantasmagoria of flower view...
6forgot about that
13I officially NEED that game now o-o
133D danmakuuuuu
6I KNOW RIGHT
6like
6more serious than IaMP, SWR, and UNL lololololol
;o
13Also lol, I've played PoFV against a friend online before
13SO MUCH LAG
02LAG = fun?
13still pretty fun though xD
nah
6aero and I play UNL against each other all the time
Isn't Phantasmagoria a very, very bad FMV game that The Spoony One did an LP of?
6most of the time, it's minimal lag
6freaking fun
Me
:D
13The lag caused the game to go on for ages though since it made dodging bullets a lot easier for both of us
6but yeah PoFV has a LOT more going on than UNL
6being an actual danmaku fight
13I haven't played it in forever though, probably because I don't like the gameplay as much

LOL
6slade is twisted LOL
I love Slade XD
inorite
I rarely saw him XD
I loved the Apprentice Arc
hmm
I need to watch more/finish the episodes
6bumblebee was legit I guess
6not much of her
Was that the one with..
6but she had a kick serious butt attitude
well you are all gonna die anyways
yeah
Aah, that Arc
Been ages
Speedy struck me as a pervert
hi
6JINX
6forgot her
6she's awesome D:
Oops, I forgot to specify. I disapprove smoking cigarettes.
looool jinx
Cigars and hookahs and the like are okay.
6mammoth was a tard
But not smoking pot?
;o
mammoth hahaha
Nope
not pot
Brother Blood
i just sparked one up
Pot can be stuck into hookahs as well.
6that whole arc was interesting
6but weird
It's healthier than ciarettes
And Brain was lulz
Oh Him XD
6it didn't have the same awesome feel as the first couple arcs
Meh, i like my luckies
cigarettes*
Ojh them XD
my favourite season was the first one
6but I like that Beast Boy got to dominate something for once
What about that stone monster?
as it had the most Slade in it
6cinderblock
I loved Episode 4
Ah XD
Epicsode 4 was the first one I saw
.
Episode*
/me saved one for another day e.e.
6which was the 4th one?
6I remember the first one i saw wasn't the first episode...
The one where Slade is disguised
As the old man thing
a few**
and summons the fire monster
6the first one I saw was the thunder/lightning brothers
i got daddy to give me a whole pack ^-^
6...
6yeh that's it
and then Thunder and Lightning do their thunderstorm thing
6LOL
...
;o
LOL
lmfaaaao
/me 6highfive
:O What kind?
^5 XD
haha
sadly marlboro menthol lights
didn't expect that
:O I like malbs
menthol are ok
6I remember laughing til I cried on the inside raven's mind one
but i cant handle the non-lights
i wanted marldoro no. 58
6because it was rather random
LOL that one
6FLOATING STRAWBERRIES
/me has a sore throat
yeah that was random
vhj
LOL
XD
episode 5 or 6 or something
Anyone wanna tell her what happened with the shower?
I need to watch them all agin
*again ;.;
but heh, Robin would make such an awesome apprentice
To evil ;.;
if he ever started obeying Slade like
6robin annoyed me
someone replaced your water with kerosene?
robin was kinda annoying but hey
he's like Slade
6but hey, yeah
lol
6I acknowledge that LOL
/me was cleaning the showe
6also
6did you
Slade was the most epic villain ever XD
6ever think slade was his father?
Yes XD
With the dropped soap
6cuz I remember
and then i decided to use toilet bowl cleaner
6thinking that
yeah
6for the longest time
6I still do
XD
not noticing that there was bleach on the floor
THE scary part XD
and then it started mixing
and fizzing up
In the volcano
oh remember in the apprentice arc
and then smoke came out
when half of Slade's mask comes off?
lol fail you made mustard gas
then i called poison control
YEss ;.;
RUBY EYE
Eeep
6yep
6his hair totally looked like robin's
/me 6runs
and it turned out to be some kind of highly toxic gas
he doesn't look like his comic self...sort of could have been batman in disguise
yeah XD
Did you die? :o
mustard gas
it eats away at your lungs and other tissue
Please say yes!
;o
Could be like in Star Wars Episode 5!
lmfao
And Luke goes into the cave
I liked Star Wars Episode 3
where Anakin goes to the dark side /random
3 was the best out of all the firsts
but really, it was horrible
I can't remember any of the other chars in Teen Titans
and now my throat hurts a lot
I didn't really like 5
bleach + ammonia makes mustard gas
MAD MOXD
I stopped watching after I lost my 12GB of the episodes
*Mod
LOL Mad mod
ENGLISH :D
6MAD MOD
6THAT EPISODE WAS GREAT LOL
yepp
yeah XD
Old man mod
it was almost the same thing
Like trippy~
Austin Modders~
oh do you guys remember that episode
Hmm?
where's there's a race for Robin's suitcase
and RED X
Red X was awesome XD
YES
smoking seems to make it hurt more
i dunno why
well It was something like episode 40something or whatnot
Wasn't that the ep when he stole that stuff?
For that guy..
where they're all racing the Daddy guy
/me hazy memory
for Robin's suitcase?
;o
nope
6that episode was weird
ah okay
yeah it was
but it was funny
6GIANT MOBILE PIT STOP
6it was lol
when Cyborg gets out at the end
and it's like "And the T-Car comes 3rd!"
*riding on a 2-wheel thing that looks like a scooter*
XD
6lol
Yeah, like after the arc with Terra, I stoped watching XD
What
6I love how many times that car got destroyed
yeah
Maybe because smoking is not exactly gentle on the airways.
Speed buggy physics XD
and then Cyborg or someone always manages to fix it
xD
Panda, stop trying to save him, we can turn this into a good thing :o
the teen titans series were pretty awesome
shutup*
6oh and then the episode where Cyborg gets that virus
/me noticed we're all talking about something we can talk about for once
Yes XD
LOL That
Oh lawdy
that one was so random
6that was great lol
they're idiots then
it was like "Cherry!111!!11"
Icecream XD
anyhow, its just my throat that hurts
yeah XD
steak
At the final part
itll be better by tmmrw
The giant dish cone
Tasty :D
FUck poison control, go anyway just to be sure
6man
yeah the cherry XD
6I need to rewatch the series
yeah I do too
Saaamee
the first episode I watched I really loved
After I finish all 730 eps of Doctor Who though :D
Ill go first thing tmmrw
a little time out of your way is better than waking up dead
And rewatch Nogastalgia Critic
And AVGN..
ps. this happened like a week ago
heh
And it still hurts?
I had my saturday boring time passers
yepp
There were like 60 episodes altogether I think
Before IRC]
go in! tell them you've been exposed to homemade mustard gas
does anyone remember Silky?
Yeah that doesn't sound good
6YES LOL
Nope XD
XD
HMM
Ok, ill go in tmmrw
02OMG

Like, really
you better or i'm gonna find a way to canada and come kick your arse
6that series was so random
6but not in a horrible way
Well, I'll keep my hopes up ^^
yeah
a lot of the episodes were random
6they were a prime example of DOIN IT RIGHT
And the animation changes :D
but they were still good
yeah XD
They used Mustard gas in thw wars, because only a tiny ammount would disintegrate your lungs
??
the*
I hate how they stopped the series though ):
6yah
Yeaah
6I mean
02^
6I love the story they have for why they stopped it when they did
Just like with Air Bender..heh
6but they need to continue D<
yeah
i'll be on her at least off and on
*here
Teen Titans is an example of where the series doesn't explode and die
like pokemon lol
Panda, I am currently not in possession of eyes or eye sockets.
02^
Noo
or for that matter yugioh
LOL
02So much true
Your silly spray was ineffective.

Hello Bree~

;o
Hallo HML :3
Hm
hi Kosovo
Would anyone use ipv6 if I installed it on drf's server, provided that he agrees?
Because if no one is going to use it I'm not going to bother
What is ipv6?
ohai
IPv6
We use IPv4
it's the newest version of IP addresses I guess
[does not know very much about codes]
Ah
D; my head is killing me x.x
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6
Yes
Oh, I see
Since my PC has IPv6
And nothing works with it XD
Well, it is actually rather old
Thanks for the link
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.
hmmm no comment on my dream car
that's an IPv6 address
=D
minus the dot
Sadly, iPv4 is only 32 bit based
Be going now~
I swear it was 64 or something, can't remember though
it was either 8, 32 or 64
/me braindead
I didn't know that was a car
or 16
Hah
No
16bit for IPv4 is bad
yep :D
IPV6 is 64 bit
>:
look it up
i want a lancia stratos
heya
there's a joke that lancias only came in black and rust
ah right
well
if I installed it, would you use it?
hai
Since 4billion - 32bit
Well, if I can
Since I would need to figure out how to get a IPV6 adress x.x
12back
Thing is, most ISPs don't support or even know of IPv6, so you can't connect to it using it
they had all the major mechanical firsts
first electric spoiler, first v6, first 5 speed gearbox, first car with turbo and superchargers on the same engine
7Hmm...
Heya Max XD

Other then the fun math facts of it being a Stirling number, being divisible by the sum of the square of its digits, is a First Beale cipher, it and it's reverse are divisble by 7...
Two hints, as to the significance to nerds...

unless you can solve million dollar math equations, password cracking is the electronic equlivant of watching paint dry
I always type it as eXKAR
I always tab his name

How I,o
it is
Actually no I don't,i just felt like sounding smart
Tab never works for me
oo
I was never even bothered with the tab command in MIRC
This class
12i glanced at his name
Reminds you of middle school?
My attention has been lost
12and read snake
:<
What the heck Umbreon
I've got a bike, you can ride it if you like
yay, your not dead!
Oh God P=NP
12you can't say you ever made a weird mistake?
it's got a basket of bells and whings and things that make it look good.
I do
Nothing?
Wait
you break every single secure protocol in the world
P=np?
Password= No Password?
Breakthrough in computer science
I know
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%3DNP
Lul
/me makes it into his pet
pretty much all security works on the basis that you cant prove P=NP
"The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science. Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be efficiently checked by a computer can also be efficiently solved by a computer."
if you can however, that means it wont take 4 quadrillion years to crack RSA
/me introduces a yukkuri into the chat
Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be efficiently checked by a computer can also be efficiently solved by a computer.
Okay even though that's informal I STILL don't get that
Dx
same
It's stupid ;P
in the simplist terms i can say
its saying if you can check for X
can you also solve for X?
No
L
*k
HE DIEd xd
i think he's arguing with nikki's sister lol
Hate capslock
I never use it
Um
Wtf does that mean LOL
P=NP killing people
you know how you can go into wolframalpha and type in your calc homework
As I said
and it will give you the zeros
Math = suicide
you can check the zeros using the computer, but can you make a computer actually find the zeros
he's arguing with a girl trying to get her to go under his car and get a spark plug
math nerds will kill me for making that compairson
but the idea is about the same
Haha
D:
What do you need a computer to find numbers for?
I found the numbers
lol
With my EYES.
/me flees
think of it this way
http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP <- maybe this will make things simplier
if you prove P=NP
then you win a million dollars
http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/explainer-pnp.html
lol i think i just heard nikki's sister
Rofl simple wikipedia
you also create chaos in the world
Oh wow nice
.
Why
Nah
Why would you create chaos
Oh lolol
because you broke every single security protocol in the world?

they should give TREE(3) dollars

12hmm
Hm
In my book I'm going to make Ray the only person in the world who solved P=NP

but think of it this way, if you solve it
you can have free cable TV for life
*satellite
Nah
Million dollars isn't enough for me
That or he and a group of g33ks he hangs out with helped find it out, but they're msrt enough to know that releasing the answer would break socoety :3
Rofl
That'd be awesome
Well
Though it could be enough for me to own a high-end computer for the rest of my life
If someone solves it but doesn't cash in
Or live comfortable for quite a long time
the proof itself is worth more than a million dollars you know
Then they could be freaking awesome
hmmm
Wait
since it could be used for decrypting encryption standards
If it's worth more than onr million dolars
*one
Why's it inly being priced as such?
and say..write your own root certificate so you have one that looks like it is citibank and signed by verisign
Only
Whoa
you could also imitate a US government NIPRNET connection
Or hacking every school computer in the country so we can all have MINECRAFT
/me runs
or you could sign your own PS3 keys
Yes :3
if the other guys didnt beat you to it
Sony: NO TAMPERING WITH OUR PRODUCTS OR WE FORCE DOWNGRADE YOU
we trust encryption a lot in this world
AND SUE YOU
You: P=NP
and the fact that nobody knows how to factor a 32bit number
Sony: ;_;
quickly
Ah
I see it
I SEE IT NAO
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN INSIDE OF ME
THE WORLD WILL GO NUTS AS SOON IT'S PROVEN P=NP
ENDLESS PO-
/me flees
:o
whut

Lyrics
To a song
:3
If P=NP... modern assymmetric crypto goes *poof*. :P
yes!
Lulz
Indeed
And as one of my profs joked.
Sony: NO MESSING WITH OUR PS3s
Us: Screw your encryption I have P=NP!
"Some engineer somewhere probably has proved that P=NP. But the dumbass company is probably using it in a self-calibrating toaster."
lol :P

sadly, this song does not have much truth anymore
and about the only AM station I listen to is well my own
you just can't hear music anymore
You know what would be hilarious to broadcast on a loop?
One of either:
its all political and religious talk
1. Any Grand Theft Auto radio station.
2. Enclave Radio from Fallout 3

oh gosh, this clip was because of me being something of a whistle blower
this came from me picking up the Accurian HD Radio from Radioshack back in December 2006
when I took my radio home and tuned it to a known AM stereo station which was CKMX 1060 Calgary something unbelievable happened
IT ACTUALLY DECODED THE STEREO SIGNAL!
after this remarkable discovery I posted it to a message board but sadly could not record what I heard due to lack of an audio cable
but another person who bought the same receiver confirmed it and provided a recording
which is the one I spammed earlier on
your yellow in your spammer is slightly unreadable.
it depends on the display
(on white background)
it is

that is why I picked yellow for that bit

03I think I'll try Amazon's live-chat
03and see if I can get the $20 credit

interesting
someone figured out how to get Windows 95 working on iDOS
it was basically a DOS Box port
nice
the PSP version actually WILL run Windows 95 as well!
well in the case of Windows
03I love when they advertise medicine and spend twice the time talking about the side effects than the actual stuff it does
and yet I got Windows 3.0, 3.11, and 95 to work on DOS Box PSP
03:O DOSBox PSP?
03I want to play Commander Keen on my PSP
the PSP port of DOS Box
03nice
yours has a custom firmware correct?
03yeah
then you can run it
I am running it on 5.00 m33-6
and could possibly provide my version of DOS Box complete with the DBS utility which allows for loading hard disk images
03yeah mine is m33-6 too
do you want DOS Box?

this version includes DBS
03OK
What DBS
Quilava: What I just pasted?
That's the name of a bank in Singapore you know
And his name shall be Dick.
DBS is a utility for DOS Box that allows for selecting hard disk images
is he the most dismembered stick man ever made?
[19:45:24] Okay, fyi I'm not offended but I'm just surprised
I agree with most of your post though
Ah

It could be so.

Because I saw that Roosevelt quite and I was like, you are bing too serious

<Codi> Windows is unprotected sex. Linux is using a condom, the pill, a vasectomy, and the Berlin wall.
/me lol'd
12lol
no, Linux is not having sex at all :P
So windows is better sex :3
Linux has no gender :(
XD
actually, no, that's Mac
No one can do anything with your IP anyway.
Macs do porn art
06Oh no, are we here again
/me flees
I know espeon
Remember
opinions != facts
Linux is sex only you're a different species and can't transfer anything
Haha, totally
Oor..bestality
/me hides
true
06Because people making any kind of malware are just driven by the same urges as anyone just wanting others to be mad - they want to impact as many people as possible.
Well, they can't do that much lol
06We've been through it all before.
they could easily make mac and linux users mad
06People are a little bit too paranoid about their IP at times.
More like they want to get your money.
or at least mac users, and they'd probably hit more
since there's no protection
lmfao
Totally
06Either way, they want to impact as many people as possible.
linux would be harder due to the hundreds of distros to accomodate
Too many distros .c.
4chan can't do anything either, lol.
TO DESSERT
If they could I'd post up my school's IP address just for the lulz.
06It just makes it even more amusing when those buttsore people go "finding your IP, good luck getting online/on xbox live/whatever tomorrow"
06lol
The best someone said to me was "I've got your IP, I'm going to brick your router"
lmfao
>get a new router
seeya
To be fair I had to turn it off and on, but I think that was unrelated.
My current point of view on Linux is: Why the <insert swearwords here> are you not working with my hardware you <insert swear words here>!
because they don't test it with all hardware.
No, it's because they can't be arsed to write drivers for it.
Anyone getting Skyrim when it comes out?
/me installed on a non-custom netbook and got a distro designed for that brand, only a few details not working
maybe
Dragons. :D
"Oh, your NIC doesn't work... get a new one." <-- Ummm... LOL no, I'd rather spend money on a new video card.
I find it funny that we got dragons on Oblivion with a mod before Bethesda actually put them into a game.
Yes, I know NICs are cheap. But... not gigabit NICs.
Also, again... I've noticed vaguely no gigabit NIC wishes to co-operate with Linux.
XD
Also - mods on Oblivion for PS3 = Win :)
my desktop has a gigabit network interface built in ... unless you want one with multiple ports or some other specialised feature
My desktop also has (two) integrated gigabit NICs.
Which - surprise, surprise - don't work in Linux.
Such a shock ;o
I see. Are PCI NICs significantly more expensive than (accounting for the obvious) the integrated ones?
Yes... if you have to shell out money for PCIe because your only PCI slot is in use. :P
heh
I have 2 PCI ;3
heya Skylands
12Hello Skylands!
Or, mayybe 3 PCI in my desktop
I have 1 PCI, and 5 PCIe. :P
SKY *GLOMP* :3
Should be the other way around ;P
its glomp people day xD
Linux also hates modems.
lol jk
06~
06so suck it
~ x2 2
And I mean hates every modem.
Linux = Francis
I think I've got something on the lines of 1 PCI, 2 PCIe x16, and 1 PCIe x4 (or is the small type x8?)
Unless you shell out an arm and a leg for one of the fully hardware modems... which are made only by USR, and which cost as much as a video card.
Speaking of screwy modems
I DCed again x.x
Yup 2 PCI and 1 PCIe
MiniTowers FTW
ohai
;o
Hey.
04</lae>
04&late
How you doing?
04* *
04holy sheet Dx
I've been better
you?
I'm alright thanks, what's wrong?
just a lot to do
I have a full tower but mATX mainboard. This mainboard provided everything I needed, so the extra cost of full ATX wasn't worth it
Ah, ok.
thanks for asking
I hate mIRC
Erm, my touchpad
My next PC - which I'll probably get this summer I've already planned out.
My old XPs 700 system has..
/me checks
until I can reliably get a fair income I'll stick with very occasional improvements to my current rather than new PCs
I found a wonderfully cheap rackmountable server case. :P
and I'm not sure I'll really ever need to upgrade the RAM or CPU
Which can have the rack mounting hardware removed while leaving the handles attached.
well, maybe the RAM, but that's the easy of the two
Therefore: Insta LANparty capable system. :P
Hmm.. one PCieX1, two PCIe and three PCi
I don't have any use for more than one PCie port, so I win 8D
I'll have use for multiple PCIe ports with the new box. :P
SLi is the use I'll have for it
It's called QuadSLI. :P
College does that to you
Ew SLi
Since it's nvidia ;PO
Quad lol, with what cards?
;o
06It is.
and shush, just cause you don't have epic powerful cards
Damn... where's the list I made...
And I don't game, so no use for anything
XD
You know the only reason I'm getting multiple video cards for is to abuse them for high power computing reasons. :P
If I had the bling I'd buy a tesla. :P
My cute little low power HD4350 would work
Loltesla, overkill
Ha, haven't seen you on in ages RDX.
your HD4350 apparently gets less performance than my GeForce 8600 OC
ew GeForce lol
Derp >:D
And if I had even more bling, I'd try and find an actual supercomputer to abuse. :P (Even though they basically want them GONE after about five years. :P )
suuuupercomputers
I WANT ONE
/me idles
(They still need power and cooling up the yin yang. :P )
Hahaah
Ew Geforce period
And when you play nothing more than old emulated games, your GPU power really doesn't mean anything
(unless it is from 2003)
RDX keeps forgetting we exist
HML you were saying an emulated PS1 game lagged
Crappy Laptop's the reason
16bit <32
Hey
Moreso the drivers x.x
get new drivers
Since the actual specs of the GPU here (intergrated into the CPU) are decent and are like my PC's
Tried, didn't fix anything
;o
And only supports DirectX10
the very base specs of a GPU are fairly irrelevant. My 8600 isn't that far behind a GTX 580 in terms of the most basic numbers
but in terms of actual game performance?
pfft
no comparison
Well this isn't a gaming laptop you know :|
(Which is another reason why I stick to consoles for gaming)_
PS3 for HD shaders on SNES! :)
EW Ps3
HD shaders for PS1 games i ePSXe ;P
you stick to consoles that are decades out of date and easily emulated by new computers
mmmmmmmmmmm taco bell
Because it's fun
Lol, ePSXe is so crap.
:O
nom
Works great for me ;P
and while I agree Ew PS3 that's the only bad thing to the newest gen
I'd rather play my PS1 games on my PS2. :)
^Agreed
But I don't have any of my old PS1 disks
(Hence the reason for emulators)
=P
it's soylent green
:P
Anyway, PS3 became epic since geohot/fail0verflow hacks.
And why have emulators when you have the actual consoles/carts?
not atm i'm streaming stuff about the quake and destruction in japan
:(
for convenience. And unless that's a hack to get back all the nice features they removed I don't see how it's that epic
Thats so sad man
There is.
it's in my url catcher so i have the link
AbestOS
Lung cancer
They were one of my top 5 fave countries
i've got friends over there
:O
You can even run XP/Vista/7 on PS3 now, I think.
omg
Bit crappy though.
Only works well with really lightweight linux.
I would think
hrm, not bad then.
still don't particularly like PS3 itself though
Lightweight linux, I wonder
Sounds like DOS
And anything that annoys Sony is good, since they seem to hate their customers so much. >_>
/me imagines Vista nomming all 256 MB of system memory rather easily
Totally, the killed the PS3 x.x
*they
So many people getting on PSN without their latest firmware, and their temp bans were evaded in less than a day. XD
Fail revisions mostly
hurp durp
So far they haven't issued any IP bans.
They've just been a bit of a fail.
Also backup managers ftw.
Thats so sad though
Playing games without the disk and not worrying about getting the disks getting damage. :)

12Hi
7I came up with Craig's name while thinking about it. O_o
14Patrat is a good name for your Patrat
14very creative
7Indeed.
should be able to finish tonight
20 episodes, half hour eaf
*each
that gives you 10 hours
Did you watch the "OVER 9000" episode?
.___.
lol
Well everyone makes some mistakes, I just can't read things with mistakes every line.
that was awhile ago
way back in season 1
http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4913653/1/The_Gangs_Weird_Day
and actually the episodes are 22 minute each
06Which usually only happens if people are just like "I can't be bothered to correct it, who will care anyway!"
I'm debating whether or not to go on to GT next....I don't like that series as much
That gives you 7.33333333333333333333 hours
:D
Meh, I just read the (good) m-rated fics on my DSiXL ;P
And the imm firin' mah lazor one?
i got one m-rated one
Oh murr, show~
yeah I think I passed that too
it has elise in there xD
/me can feel the powah! XD
that's from DBZ?
Woah
...no
/me never knew that
I've read a nice random one ;X
Yeah, I found that out recently.
lol
does it have the weird face and everything
Looked up the original clip.

12yes...yes i am
we were talking about "imma firin' mah lazor!"
03hto
7Where's that from, NS? O_o

actually I think I should take my leave from Pokemon and focus on my other hobbies and interests

I am basically drifting further and further away and happen to be stuck in 1998-2003 permanently in relation to the anime, movies, and music
it seems like nothing will rekindle my interest now

Too late
Your countrymen has demonstrated otherwise
/me yaaaawns
you can't let the actions of just a few people judge your entire outlook on a nation
that just seems unbelieveably shallow
They demonstrated themselves to be shallow
Why should I not be shallow to them?
it would be like me calling all Germans Nazi pigs despite the fact that this stereotype is highly untrue these days
I won't do that
That is so long ago
This is happening now
XD
hi
clone
:<
!pokemon
!digimon
I feel a bit embarassed that some people from my country are saying that the Japanese "deserved this"
when I heard it was happening I was a bit concerned and still am
hi Presea
I have been through an earthquake more minor than this but it was still powerful enough to cause structural damage near the epicenter and even further away knock books and other items off shelves
hi junh
what's up
New Orleans deserved it
I hope this happens to the entire U.S.
this will teach them
you are really being an <censored> right now
and honestly I am fed up with your death wishes to myself and my nation
jerk
I usually don't do this
But these people pushed me beyond the line
Sorry
how would you feel if I wished that Singapore would become the next Atlantis and sink into the sea permanently
Look at this
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1365546/Japan-earthquake-pictures-Devastation-rescue-workers-fight-fires-search-survivors.html
Now read this
http://karmajapan.tumblr.com/
xD
I won't need words
these people are just ignorant
I don't feel that Japan deserved this
I don't feel like hundreds of thousands or perhaps millions of people deserve to be homeless
probably a bunch of middle schools who aren't aware of what's real or not
schoolers*
it IS real
ya but that doesn't seem to click for some ppl who constantly see things like this in games and media
so they see it as some sick joke
that might be why
my faith in ppl here and anywhere with alot of media is pretty low
if someone is in an accident here
and there's 40 ppl around
I have seen nature's fury first hand
NOT ONE will help them
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U01xasUtlvw&feature=related
they'll just stand there Maybe
tornados, severe thunderstorms, and yes even earthquakes
or just keep walking
i've seen them as well
but nothing compares to japan
for me
the devastation Sendai saw echos that of what happened to New Orleans in 2004
you have to realize how many ppl are on that island country
packed together
millions
ya
so you've seen nothing like what they went through
you can compare something similar to it
but when it gets down to the math..
on how many lives are effected
I was comparing the destruction largely but good point
even if the aftershocks stop, and the nuclear plant doesn't explode
/me yawns
the long term effects are going to be Bad
there already was an explosion
ya
from pressure buildup
but it was NOT like Chernobyl
but not a meltdown from what i heard
a huge portion of Japan will not be uninhabitable
the reactors are light water and of a very modern design
ogod
certainly speaks volumes of Japanese engineering
ya and atm they're using sea water to cool the reactor
>.>
which is good but tells you their situation isn't
they are in a pinch and I am sure it will have at least some effect
I hope all nuclear power plants in the U.S. go boom
That will teach them
teach them what?
they'll be dead
want 250 million dead?
do ya?
>.>
stop being silly
Look at yourselves in the mirror first
you are just being a prick
an arrogant and selfish <censored>
Bicycle repair man
you shouldn't wish for lives to be lost
I don't
exactly
Presea seems to be the voice of reason here
plus if you look at those comments closer you'll notice signs they're probably made from ignorant middle schoolers
>.>
its two against one right now
ya

12Hi
hi
I just went wat
wishing that the entire country suffered a massive disaster
if you want I can give you the details
I saw
still
opinion != fact
12I don‚Äôt think anyone should be hateful against anyone :(
I don't either
well
you have to learn that haters gonna hate
and ignore them
being offended is stupid
12True
opinion != fact as I have said many times before
03see
03I'm not hateful against any*one*, just against inanimate objects
03but people still get butthurt >_>
12So you don't hate the user, just the apple?
well drf
03yeah LOPL
you know my quote
03*LOL
"If people get butthurt, it's their fault"
I still think that but okay
03yep
12XD
03unless it's me who makes them butthurt, then people rage and complain that I shouldn't be a mod
03>_>
lol I get called a jerk
but it's not like I even care
see, once you getting into this so-called "trolling" business then very few things offend you anymore
03XD
03I've been like that because of crap I went through IRL
12I think overall drf, you‚Äôre a good mod
only comments from friends and close people etc. have an effect
same
03back in middle school I got bullied so much for liking Pok√©mon that I'd come home from school in tears half hte time
drf is cool derp
03so I started just not caring
03and now I basically never get offended
I got bullied for being who I am
03unless people constantly call me gay
03THEN I get annoyed
03because I'm not, and I can prove it LOL
and my mum used to abuse me
03but other than that, call me a jerk or whatever all you want, I don't care
and throw insults (still does)
^
people take things too seriously these days
03yep
eh
it gets annoying after a while
03what does
I swear, I make a joke, and then people send glares at me like I did something bad
03ah
12lol
okay, maybe they are innuendos but that's sometimes
/me hides

Xeli corrupted me within a week lol
12lol
I corrupted Drake within 2 weeks
corrupted
04?
how so
04lol not that quickly
12And now your slowly corrupting me D:
well, 2-3 weeks Drake
Xeli got me onto ED and then 4chan
04more like a month or two
nah
I don't think it was more than a month
no really i don't get what you mean by corrupt
>.>
uh well
Drake can explain!
/me moves away
04Basically
ahahaha
04she mindscrews me by telling me about 4chan, ED and Anonymous.
<Drake> PLaying the 360 and swimming in the poo. <Drake> pool*
ah
04Then shows me pron.
then I make you love pron.
well i've been online since 1999
04It was scarring, but I got over it
randomly
so
and then I drew that random crappy pic of dragonsex on the oekaki
and Shiny rages at me for it
/me hides
it's probably been a long time since i was as you refer to as "corrupted"
xD
well, it's bound to happen
why not earlier than later
then again i visit 2chan more then 4chan
lol 2chan
04You're only corrupted if you were once innocent.
innocent
yeah Drake
Want logs? :3
12XD
that didn't really change if you ask me
then again i'm older then most ppl here :<
04Not really.
/me mindrapes Drake with logs
/me cackles evilly
...that was not like me.
/me sighs

I mean hi
04No it was not
yeah I do too Presea
I have logs of when I first joined IRC
courtesy of Umbreon
i lost those
lmfao
hang on
in like.. 02-03
i can't exactly remember much from that time
xD
other then that i was in a channel full of random users
I joined in like
2008
and they were awesome
or 2009
it was as if they were all hyper non-stop
also Presea
I got the pass to my school internet lol
oh fun
how'd you get it

WEP key viewer
even though it was a WPA network

lol
the first server i went to has been dead for like 6 years
and the 2nd and 3rd ones as well
and the 4th and 5th ones
and the 6th server i went to is gone too
this was/is my first server
and from then on i've been to countless irc servers and more then half of those are gone
HoR was my second
after that was sysnet and PS
then hackthissite/HTS
can't rememer what else
remember*
heh
!dns stardust.shadowuniverse.co.cc
Resolved stardust.shadowuniverse.co.cc to: 216.245.198.184
ok
i can't remember the names of those servers as they were kinda odd and long as it was
that's fine
!dns irc.shadowuniverse.co.cc
Resolved irc.shadowuniverse.co.cc to: 184.8.172.15, 216.245.198.184

ah
when did i get here
Time registered: May 04 06:31:39 2007 UTC
o-O
heh
my nicks dropped iirc
well
I grouped with Drake
and then we dropped them
when I rejoined
ah
so I could get them back
oh damn
News from Japan gets worse
o-o
what happened now
o_o
My dad came home with a copy of the local paper
On the front page
80,000 people missing, feared dead
i thought so
2000 dead, 1000 injured
o-o
woah
you see 4 entire trains went missing
2 major cities in Japan flooded
and they were loaded with ppl
and those boats and cars you see
I saw
also had ppl
so i Knew they're guess of 1000 ppl had to be wrong
so 100,000 missing and possibly dead was perhaps a reasonable guess
their*
Also
Newest estimates puts quake at magnitude 9
holy cow
180 people irradiated in the vinicity of nuclear power plant
o-o
I guess the iodine supliments were mentioned already
HAARP
they were from the news sources here in the US
I find that bogus
HAARP in no way could be involved
I'm just reposting everything that was just on the front page of this Chinese evening paper
And just the front page
Holy cow
the situation there just seems to be getting worse and worse
so..
there's missing missiles
just out there
in the piles of stuff
that could get set off?
yes
it seems to be getting worse and worse
just as I said
i'd have to say
so
I am sure Japan will be able to recover
but it will take years
in a few decades
their economy was already bad before this happened
release of movie about Tangshan earthquake in China delayed indefinitely
in Japanese theatres
i think anything related to quakes is going to be put on hold
i recall watching an anime which was more of a japanese PSA about large quakes
the anime came out in like 2004
yet even with the details of the risk
they didn't or couldn't do much
about it
from what I heard a Pokemon episode was never aired due to earthquakes
and never will be
so both original series and Advanced Generation have lost episodes
ya
well not really for original series
heh speaking of which there was a rumor going around the maker of pokemon died, but it's false
i wonder who comes up with these ideas
:<
o-o
Electric Solder Porygon survives on home recorded VHS tapes
probably some random fgt
tracked him down to some twitter account where he reported he was glad to finally make it home
>.>
apparently alot of devs in japan use twitter
ew
ya ew
but anyways i also read that nintendo reported that it was unphased by the quake and that it was "hardly the time to be thinking about video games"
I heard about it yesterday
ya
quite a few companys have shutdown factorys in japan
even some that weren't directly effected by the quake
I am not surprised
a number of people even in Tokyo could very well have family members in the effected areas
its a safe bet
ya
it seems like the right thing to do
especially given how many are missing
lmfao

Please use irc.lugia.us as your DNS if you wish to connect to the IRC network.
Servers: ocean.lugia.us, island.lugia.us (DNS is currently not set up, use tst.lugia.us to connect)
For more information on a specific server, type !ocean or !island. All servers have SSL on port 6697.
Only pros use 64.32.1.34 +1337
where, why?
why?????
hey
only pros use 64.32.1.34 9001 :B
But you said SSL is pro ;P
true
so +6697
is best
I shall create +34
if drf let's me
03sure I don't care
he could probably /addline it
then again

Why do they not have nipples?
drf lol, we should just open 64.32.1.34:0-65535;

OMG

we need ipv6 support
and I need to install ipv6 on shadowfire
Yes c.c
But does anyone have IPv6 even working ;P
we have it on shadowfire
but we don't have ssl on shadowfire
I've been trying to recompile ZNC
but damn RAM problems
How many megs do you did?
*Do you need
dunno
apparently 128 is JUST enough and we have unrealircd running
which I'm not allowed to kill off
-.-
Idk, im as surprised as you mate :(
So you can't use another PC to compile right .c.
well it's a VPS
I mean, boobies gotta have nipples, right?
not exactly a home computer
like flame and rainbow/shadow/ambernova
Ah, fail
rainbow lags
I'm probably going to take it down
flame is pretty damn good, as it has like
a 30mbps connection

7I feel almost bad about luring her into my conversation.
Why?
ohai-i/
*?
/me flees
7She's doing everything she can (and that's not much) to prove that she drew an image she obviously did not.
02back
02and o-o
7I'm luring her by making suggestions, like: 'What, did you use X to make those?'
7And she says yes.
wow o.o
03hm
03anyone here good with Pok√©mon moves?
7In what detail?
/me shrugs
03LOL I JUST GOT 1336exp
03ONE OFF
if you suspect its one of the first five I might be able to help
03well basically.
03it just learned Flamethrower
03according to bulbapedia, the only actually useful moves it learns after that are Heat Wave and Flare Blitz
03Flare Blitz does recoil damage so no.
03but Heat Wave... apparently is a special attack that does 100 damage?
lol
03I don't know if it's worth waiting until level 51
03to learn it
7Well, it hits multiple enemies.
03well, at 45 it learns Crunch which seems nice XD
03it doesn't hit the allies though?
doesnt it lower stats/
03as I know stuff like Surf does
*?
03doesn't what lower stats
/me 7checks.
He-wait
no
nvm
03k
thats Overheat
03ah
7Dang, it only hits one. O_o
7In PMD, it hit the entire room of pokemon, so...
03wait what
03Heat Wave inflicts damage and has a 10% chance of burning the target. Heat Wave hits all other opposing Pok√©mon in double and triple battles.
03it says it does
03but I don't know if it also hits the allies
03or just the enemies
7O_o
7'cording to Serebii, no.
most likely all
7But..
7Gah, I don't know. X.x
03but hm
03is learning Crunch at all useful?
7Against Psychic or Ghost types.
03jhytfyjufgtyufdg
03you know what's weird though?
03I already know Retalliate.
03apparently you learn it at 48
03oh wait
03I think I used a TM
lol
03FRICK
03FRICK
03FRICK
03HOW DOES FLAMETHROWER MISS
/me resets
03the enemy had like 1HP left
03used Brine
03ohko
03X.X
7BTW, anyone serve as a middleman for transferring my event legendaries to White?
03I could
7Now?
03is the issue just that you only have one DS?
7Yep.
03ah
03OK
03let me finish with this battle first
lol
03then I should be able to
7Thanks.
03well
03I can leave the trade going while using my DSi XL to battle XD
what does the timer thingy do xD
03you use the um
7o.o
7Okay?
03that thingy in the start menu
03to transfer them
03right?
but not Ash, Max and Brock... http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/479/x1pbglkvql4bvneu1khulm16lpeavh.jpg
03Relocator I thin?
03*l
03*k
7o.O
7Relocator?
hmm
03yeah.
!kickme
XD
7What point in the game am I supposed to get that?
03I think that's what you use for legendaries
!bomb
!red
03you have to talk to a guy
03and give him a keyword
!cut red
...
Safe wire resets the timer! 54 seconds left! Time's running out, hurry up!
03kinda like how you got Mystery Gift in gen 2
!cut ble
7OH, THAT.
!cut blue
Wrong wire! Kaboom! Correct wire was the green wire!
7Dang, where's the guy and what're the words?
D:
7I remember him.
03I dunno
/me 7Serebiis.
03but you still need someone with another DS, right?
7IRL?
03no
03I mean
03you only have one?
7Yes.
03right
03so I can use the Relocator
03and then trade them back to you
03from White
7Okay.
i didnt get kicked D:
7Trading from Pearl to yours, and then from that to White?
03lemme grab my Platinum
03yeah.
7Okay.
lol
7Got the relocator.
03how many event Pok√©mon do you have total?
7 4.
03I'm gonna catch some Bidoofs XD
03OK
03the 3 dogs and Celebi?
7Yep.
03k
lol
/me goes to catch 4 Bidoofs then
7Thank you. :)
03that you can just release XD
/me asdfasdf
why
7Hmm, wait:
did that randomly
7The relocator is only DS-to-DS.
make me think of the name
03I can use the Relocator to put them in my game.
7Normal trading?
7o.o
03that should put them in "event mode"
03I think
7Okay.
03if not, well
03I'll back up the save first.
I plan on giving Reshi
+?
03that way I get free events
/me runs
03because I missed all but Raikou.
7I'll need to catch four random pokemon, too, right?

You might be.

We're always watching.
god and jesus are always with you watching your every move

oh and satan
waiting for you to fall to his side
because if you believe in god you believe in satan
:<
:(
Don't the mormans believe in god but not satan?
thought he was like an angel still or something
to them
Donno
where as to everyone else he's a fallen angel
i'm an outsider when it comes to these matters though
i like to read up on them
As do I.
kinda have to know these things even if i don't believe in them as i live in the bible belt

Now
BUS and HOUSE on roof

is ship on roof
But even without it I'm utterly amazed at the power of destruction that sept Japan

http://sisinmaru.blog17.fc2.com/ <- And now, maybe something to make you smile
yay! kitty!
http://www.iris.edu/edu/10.5/EQSimulator.html <- This. Is. So. Wrong.
"It is not beyond possibility that a massive earthquake of magnitude 10.0 ( 10 )or 10.1 on the Richter scale could be produced on the planet, in extreme circumstances. This level of quake would cause damage to the earth's crust on a truly global scale, with the fault line likely to circle a large part of the planet, causing massive destruction on many continents and probably unbelievably
high death tolls - although, by contrast, the energy produced by such an earthquake as this is only a tiny fraction of the energy the earth receives every day from the sun in the form of light and heat! Try the "Earthquake Simulator" to see what it might take to produce a "Mega-Quake" here"
If a magnitude 10 quake occurs the earth will literally crack apart
9 = what's happening in Japan right now
9.4 = Sumatra, Indonesia
*9.3
Most powerful earthquake was 9.5
In Chile, 1960
Interesting
1952, there was a 9.0 quake in Kamchatka, far east Russia
ouch
1960, Valdivia quake in Chile was 9.5 (worst ever)
Japan's quake is, I believe, the largest near a densely populated area and/or several nuclear power stations
1963, Kuril Islands in Russia far east had a 8.5
1964, Alaska had another, on 9.2
yea, there are big areas under nuclear radiation, poor bastards
Then Rat Islands in Alaska got another at 8.7
Seems like the strong quakes happen together in a few years
agreed, pardon me
There's definitely a relation
And this is definitely not a sign of the End of the World
no, i hope not
Just look at 1957-1965
too less evidence for the end
LU you retard
it's possible that large quakes in areas of the world could loosen the plates to allow for other strong events elsewhere
/me shuns .v.
2004, Sumatra in Indonesia got a 9.1, and we all knew what happened >>
i know HML, i am a retard, deal with it
/me puts on glasses
Then a year later they got an 8.6
2 years later an 8.7 in the same place again
Last year in Chile there was an 8.8
And now in Japan we have a 9
ouch, what was the beginning? what coused it?
I could rather point out the fact that strong quakes seem to "cluster" around a period of years
it's possible that large quakes in areas of the world could loosen the plates to allow for other strong events elsewhere
Yes, that
Notice that they happen in the same general region as well
one disturbance helps shift the others along, until before long all the energy is released. At that point no more quakes are able to happen, so they settle down and start building up again, until one gives way and fires the others
the 1957-1965 seems concentrated to Alaska
This one is on Sumatra
the fact they're in the same region is more just that those regions have high tectonic activity, making them quake-prone in general
So Alaska and Sumatra is quake prone.
AVOID.
/me hides
But yeah, you nailed it
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_earthquakes#Largest_earthquakes_by_magnitude
/me slaps himself around a bit with a large trout
Unfunny joke punishment
right
Anyway, look at that likst
*list
wow, a magnitude 9.5?
now i was thinking about the move from Camperut, magnitude.....i think they made that one purpose
or earthquake
You know
Whenever I play Pok√©mon
And one of them goes
"Magnitude 9!"
on my Pok√©mon
....that move is actually awefull in combination with this
I think, "THIS IS SO WRONG"
/me hides
(going back to topic)
mmm, what would happen if a magnitude 9 Earthquake would hit the area of the Pacific Ring of Fire?
that wouldn't be too nice after all
That already happened
Indonesia in 2004, Japan now
oh
ah, yes, i suck at geography
Though it is VERY unlikely that the whole thing will go trembling at the same time
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_ring_of_fire
Jolts here and there along the ring every now and then, but never all at the same time
yea, that would be VERY unlikely
(it could hypothetically, but only in really extreme circumstances)
One quake along it could trigger another later on
But they will never go shaking at the same time
mmm, a chain reaction could be possibele, but as you said, NEVER at the same time
or atleats, VERY unlikely
"It is not beyond possibility that a massive earthquake of magnitude 10.0 ( 10 )or 10.1 on the Richter scale could be produced on the planet, in extreme circumstances.

ahw, that would be HORRIBLE
each quake just loosens the plates so that the next quake will happen in a few years, rather than a few decades
so we are talking about a domino effect? eventually?
http://www.iris.edu/edu/10.5/EQSimulator.html <- Max out everything, read the text, and then press create earthquake for a bit of a primere
-e
On why such strong earthquakes are near impossible
note that if the number on the richter scale increases by 1, the strength of the quake increases by ten - a 10.1 would be approaching twenty times more powerful than the one Japan just got hit by (8.9)
It's a scale that goes 1 10 100 1000 10000 etc., I know
logametric
a 35km depth quake would have to shift a 40,000 km fault by 350 metres to create a magnitude 10.7. Holy hell.
ouch, i'm gonna bring this whole toopic up on class tommorrow
where gonna discuss it
a quake of 10+ magnitude is exceedingly unlikely
indeed
The death toll from such a quake could be in billions
frightening
billions is highly unlikely, but millions is almost definite
you can basically write off anyone who lives on a coast
plus holland
That means I'm included
Since I'm pretty near a coast
From here it's a 20-minute bucycle ride or a 10-minute bus ride to the shore
our tallest skyscraper goes up to 280 metres though
Most residential apartment blocks are much shorter
i don't live near the coast, around 200KM from it
Mine is 16 floors
The highest is 50 floors
Most here are around 12-20 floors
Hmmm
I live on the second floor, but if I could run up fast
so most would be high enough, if they could withstand the impact
lol, better start trainign then
that much water is going to carry quite a punch
Maybe I could get to the higher floors of my block in time, then maybe yes
it doesn't come all straight away in a wall of water
i think i don't want to know
It's more like, a bit, then a lot, then HOLY SHEET THE BOATS AND HOUSES ARE MOVING
yea.....
Scary
i would cr*p my pants if i saw it
I think the fact that there wasn't so much water at first might had made some people complacent, sadly
it's resistance from land that stops them
well, slows
they keep going a looooong way
you never know how bad it could get until the whole thing comes in
if it's low, it tends to be little impact but a lot of water dragged a long
high ones are *smash* followed by a comparable amount of water
so, are there anymore "waves" incoming in the Red Zones?
At the end of the day, when you think about it
This isn't 2012 or End of The World
no, never
The carnage is especially bad here because lots of people + nuclear power plants
If this happened in a place with nobody no one could have cared
The problem is that this happened in a place with millions of people
And nuclear power plants
yea, the Nuclear Powerplants screw things up pretty easly
all the radiation coming from it....
did the japaneese not lear how killing radiation is?
referring to the terrorism attack on Hirishima of course
well, when they need energy, screw everything else
Unfortunately
yea, but still, nuclear radiation is NOT funny
Here in Singapore there was talk of setting up a nuclear power plant D:
oh, what a bummer
nuclear power is the cleanest we have when there isn't a leak
Now that this happened, people are saying "better think twice"
by quite a way
Thanks, but I prefer solar
we have a Solar boiler
They should really spend money and research on that
modern reactor designs wouldn't be vulnerable to what went wrong in Japan
and solar power is painfully inefficient
make better solar panels, set up more solar power plants
I hope in the mid-term there can be a breakthrough on that
yea, that would be ALOT better for the economy and enviorment
so instead of <48% (often much lower) we are getting now it will be closer to 70%
/me hugs his solar keyboard from Logitech
and that's 3 GW at peak output, midday
not averaged over the day
also area is assuming it's built directly on the equator
We ARE near the equator
the problem: we have no land
but most aren't
hmmm.
As I said, research research research
at 45 degrees latitude, which is approx. where much of the population is, you'd need 1.4 times more area on one of the axes
it is not physically possible to get more
Still
The problem is we are NOT tapping into it
We should try tapping into it first before we start going nuclear
because it requires ridiculous land areas compared to small nuclear power stations and ends up more expensive
At least we can say we tried better alternatives
solar requires far more maintenance. And nuclear is not worse, so long as it is well-maintained. The UK has only had two nuclear accidents, only one serious, and that was at the very start of the nuclear age
1957 at Sellafield
33 resulted deaths from a fire on a plutonium fire, which isn't bad considering just what the event was
*plutonium pile
and, like I said, modern reactors are not vulnerable to what Japan is now suffering
the new designs are failsafe, if there's a power failure, all rods are dropped directly into heavy absorbant to shut off the reaction
Hmmm
I do wonder if accidents have happened at solar power plants
But still, I'm not convinced
the radiation is just no good
the best idea we could put research into now is fusion. Totally failsafe purely by nature, as it needs ridiculous energy -input- to run - if there's a failure, it simply can't continue
agreed, i've read that they can generate electricity for a small lamp from a plant
Still I say
Maybe in the long run, just maybe
the radiation experienced by the average nuclear plant worker is well below the healthy limit, so assuming nothing goes wrong - which is, again, near impossible in modern designs - the radiation is not a problem
We may have to concentrate on both areas, but I still say solar first
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_debate <- reading this now
hello
weapons? you're kidding right?
residual radiation from previously detonated weapons is present all over the world
oh, golly, mor Gorge Bush stuff
well, BRB
I'm not sure the US detonated any weapons during George Bush's reign. And I think that Russia may have made more test-detonations
Over its history as a nuclear test site, Novaya Zemlya hosted 224 nuclear detonations with a total explosive energy equivalent to 265 megatons of TNT.[17] For comparison, all explosives used in World War II, including the detonations of two U.S. nuclear bombs, amounted to only two megatons.[19]
nice.
that island also still has almost 3,000 people living on it, so radiation can't be that much risk
But are they still living healthily, or...?
(!!)
they're living healthily enough, yes.
Its seismic body wave magnitude was about 5 to 5.25.[6] The energy yield was around 7.1 on the Richter scale but, since the bomb was detonated in air rather than underground, most of the energy was not converted to seismic waves. <-- not strictly relevant but a fun fact about the Tsar Bomb
"By contrast, coal plants create nearly a million tons of waste per day and release more total radioactivity than nuclear plants, due to the uranium and thorium found naturally within the coal." <<- Oh?
harr.
/me can believe that, actually
I'm still not totally convinced, though I think it may have a place in our future energy production
I still think solar is the best way to go
If not for main energy generation, then as a supplement to nuclear
But if anything like this happens -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fukushima_explosion.jpg
Boom.
that was an explosion unrelated to the reactor, though it's feasible the reactor may have provided the heat to trigger it
Yeah, but still worrying
And that definitely won't make people worry less
it's possible new designs could cause something similar but they will start cooling down very quickly by comparison and won't have much chance to
explosions like that are a risk at any plant
nukes .m.
also give me a few moments, I want to try make a fun little calculation
trolol
a solar plant 1 kilometre wide, powering the entire earth (based on the energy consumption of 2008), would be 15,000 km in length
lol
assuming 100% efficiency
possibly slightly longer, given I'm assuming 1 KW/m^2 and it's actually slightly less, I believe
(if you go looking for solar intensity you'll get values from 1.3 to 1.4 because that's if you don't account for atmosphere)
eya ecco
whats up?
just woke up from a nap
always nice eh/ an afternoon nap?
I don't noramlly take naps actually, I've caught a cold so after my two morning classes, I slept from about 10:30 to now, which is 1:20 PM now, xP

Haha, thanks.
I'm bored
lol
You finished watching DBZ then?
yeah
think it took two weeks
Did you buy all the episodes?
I bought the seasons as they came out
So you've got all of them so far?
yeah
How many episodes are there?
291
Wow.
yes I have no life I know
Lol, I wouldn't say that.
nah, many are much worse
I remember I have ~15 days of playing of COD6. XD
Have to work on the original series next
lol
well
God knows how many hours of the regular game I've played
You play any other PC games?
yeah
been playing Dawn of War 2 for a bit now
I'm getting Shogun Total War 2 when it comes out tomorrow
Cool - what kind of a game is it?
which one?
Shogun Total War
RTS
never played any of the other ones?
it's a whole series
Don't think so.
Rome Total War
Oh, yeah.
Medieval Total War
Shogun was the original one
they revamped it looks sweet
I've played Rome Total War before.
10spending the night at a friend's house, I'll be back sometime tomorrow
you have Steam?
Yeah, haven't used it in a while though.
It's become quite convenient for me

03I wish you could ride your bike without stopping the music :(
7And how they merge musicians along the way with the music. :O
7CREATIVE.
03yeah

Ehm
Japan's little meltdown?
oh, that
I haven't heard much about it
other than 2 nuclear reactors had a partial meltdown
Media don't seem to realise, meltdown != boom
Chernobyl was an extremely special case
The reactors in japan have probably already melted down
I don't know much about Chernobyl either >.>
/me didn't know Chernobyl's reactor exploded
Poorly designed reactor, corners were cut, and operational incompatancy
Where as Japan are obsessed with safety

03and see
03I have no dragon or ice types
12i beat her and didn't even have a super effective check
03so I kept using Fly, LOL
03Fly is such an awesome move
03especially
03if you poison them
03:D
03because you waste TWO turns XD
12or you can just play against me
12and keep spamming protect
12i swear...
03EW PROTECT
03her Pok√©mon don't know Protect though./
12computers will spam protect 5 times in a row and get success everytime
03LOL what
12the AI in black/white is a bit sketchy
12in my friends game
12he came across a wild woobat
12that kept spamming attract on his male pokemon, the woobat itself was male
03LOL what

12too bad everything about ozzy isn't epic, that super bowl commercial screamed sell out D:
Umbreon~~~
hm?
12how goes
03hey Umbreon, are you familiar with game mechanics?
12oh well
03of Pok√©momn
12you?
03-m
12yes
03OK well
03when you use the EXP Share
03does the other Pok√©mon get the same EVs you do?
03or do they just get none
it goes
12they get teh same evs
12*the
03OK
03so it won't ultimitely make them weaker than leveling them up individually?
12unless the pokemon with exp share has pokerus
03because I noticed my Staryu has really crap values
03and I leveled that thing up a lot with the EXP share
12i don't think the battling pokemon having pokerus makes a difference
03I don't think any of mine have it
12it's not an easy disease to find
12the only reason i ever got it was because i pokesaved a pokemon to have it
12then infected legit guys with it
03LOL
03well
03it seems in RSE and DPP they got it on their own
03so far in White, no
12lol
12wait till you beat the game
12then you can transfer pokerus over to black and white

I also just realized there was a song that was originaly supposed to be in that remix but i decided not to put it in there x3
ah, ok
it was Work it Out, from Sonic R
it never got in there
mostly because it just didnt fit in properly
too bad
yeah
its fine
it was better not to put Work it Out in the Remix

this also happend yesterday
12Two times yesterday
yea, what a bummer

12Yeah
12TST might be using more web space then paid for
12(not that I know too much about that sort of stuff)
12Or SMF is just being dumb
yea, that could also be the error
12There might be a chance that it does that when Arti works on the main site
like a "under construction" modus?
12Yeah

Hooray i downloaded the main soundtrack to Rayman 3 x_x it took AGES to download it
i still have about 60 extra songs to download
ppffff, those are ALOT
i downloaded about 173 songs
by downloading 3 at a time x_x
cause they didnt have a *.zip folder
12lol
173? by 3 at the time? pppffffff, where do you save them?
04FEATHER
04Hi
04:D
in a specific folder
03it lets you queue downloads
well, firefox queues them as well
or a external harddrive from 4TB, may come in handy with such a libary
12Norton won't let me download most things
thats stupid, go with NOD32
12It keeps my computer safe though o3o
03EW NORTON
and thats the meaning though?
03get rid of that crap and get a real antivirus
04Kaspersky
04I got that for free :3
12It's 360 though
04No piracy ;P
04lol
03I don't care
yea, go NOD32 or something from microsoft
03Norton sucks
03just get AVG
03it's free and it works
12Spent $80 on it
i got kaspersky for free with a motherboard and used for a long time after the trial had expired
03well you wasted $80 on useless crap
04get $80 back
it was great
12XD
04[15:09:43] <Vaporeon> i got kaspersky for free with a motherboard and used for a long time after the trial had expired

03you still using that CPU I sent you?
euw, dell D:
yes
03MSI Makes even better laptops :P
04What CPU? o.o
i've considered replacing it though
04You mean the one you suggested?
03I gave him my laptop's old Core 2 Duo
04oh
04k
fU:
03yeah
12What's wrong with dell?
03same stuff that's wrong with Apple
03overpriced crap
03emphasis on crap
not mine
agreed
mine wasn't overpriced B)
03well you got lucky LOL
12I plan on getting a gateway myself
03LOL Gateway
03dude, just build your own
03trust me, it'll be so much better
gateway is worse than dell
also building your own laptop sucks
get Asus
03I hate prebuilt computers, I'm never gonna buy one again
03well yeah
i mean it's easy etc.
03I'm talking about desktops
oh desktops yeah
03my laptop is custom built but it wasn't put together by me
03I paid for a place to do it XZD
03*XD
03well, it was a MSI retailer
03that built laptops
03so I just told them what I wanted
12Well, I plan on getting an all in one desktop :P
03o.o
i really want my cart from newegg
03still, build your own desktop
complete, pretty good computer for $600
03is it one of those BYOS bundles?
a what
it's a combo deal thing
12Was considering building my own desktop, but it seems so complicated
it comes with everything except video card
and actually
mine pre build was 13-14.000 Euro's
it's a nice one
if it didn't have the video card and screen it'd be $350

you'd proberly own everyone, right?

4i wish
03I'd own everyone with my Fearow
wat
03that thing is so godpowerful
oh
cool
derp
Trololwhat O.o
i don't see any of them as being particularly qualified, and that also goes for myself
i'd abuse the hell out of it
I just don't care enough to try to get staff lol
only place i'm staff of is GG2 and that's hardly applicable because i'm mod of the worst forum
I like being a normal user, lol
yeah that too
being staff comes with responisibilities and people look at you differently etc.
that hasn't happened at GG2 for me because the forum I'm mod of has almost no activity
06Sometimes even in ways that makes no sense.
06"You're a mod, no fun allowed"
06And such
lol you'd be surprised at how often that's emphasized
while not entirely true there ARE limits to the "types" of fun you can have imo
if you still want to remain true to your role
the only fun that's possible is abuse and of course that gets you demodded
lmfao
/gzline *
unless it's GG2
not like it's possible
but you know what I mean
that reminds me
the ball's stuck in GC
06Well, power abuse isn't exactly "fun" - so that shouldn't be a problem to differ from fun =P
derp
as long as the abuse is harmless it's okay enough
some abuse can be fun
and as long as it doesn't affect anyone else really
anyone that isn't okay with it
pretty much
but then there will be people who get butthurt and go like "gomg aboos"
06What both said.
06But if someone doesn't want -any- part of it it's both immature and just stupid to do "small harmless things" involving them either way.
Yeah
06Not everyone likes being kicked just for zomgRandum xDD~
"random"
and spam is something that not everyone likes
04meow
/me chews Espeon
06Very true, even though people should try to just part for 5 minutes before going ballistic about it.
06But stupid spam is usually easy to notice :3

/me hovers and burns some trees down

Baabierbarel
we desperately need forum activity
10:<
perhaps ill join later today ;D
except i hardly even post on TST D;
What all goes on in this forum anyways?
10nothing
10because it's inactive
yeah T_T
o3o my gf is on the forums x3
Well
on Ho-oh Realm
XD
I can't join since I belong to the TS- I'm too busy and inactive on any forum :(
What do you intend to go on there?
he goes there to go, if not than I'd see no point in there
xD
What XD
Hm, Typhlosion?
And yet so active on the chat
my, my
I mean
You know
What sorts of chat?
Pokemon
General chat
etc.
Cause, I want lots of NSFW chats o3o
the one we're on now
06o.o
Spend so much time here yet claim little activity
Well
HEll
There are 36 people online right now
Erm
Less
Due to bouncers
Ah
06Well, good ngiht
06..
06yeah
nii
well
Typhlosion, the forums are childsafe/SFW/whatever, the IRC isn't so much
>:|
and right now I'd say there's around 33 people on
This does not amuse me
And 5 who aren't idle
and the chat is active, the forums are not x.x
Okay then
/me is the idle king.
lol
oHAI
Why don't you make the IRC network the main focus?
!dari
nah, Altair idles like a boss
He reminds me of spicy chips
Since, Forums are slow, and people like IRC Better
Well primarily, the site is what Ho-Oh's Realm is
And, also NSFE
*NSFW
the IRC is a service/extension of it basically
Not Safe For Eccentrics
that and, if you have a forum with no activity
Well don't you suck then?
Procrastination should seriously go die in a hole. >_>
lol procrastination
doing it now
Same.
lolol
o;
*in
I was supposed to be doing things... two months ago
NO ONE PROCRASTINATES LIKE ME
ohyeah?
I was procrasinating on my fanfiction for 4 months
No
beat that bitch
If you have a forum with no activity
xD
And, an IRC network with tons of activity
Lol.
You're not a website from 20 years ago >:/
._.
we're like
1 and a half years old
toddler
Exactly
xD
INFANT
Stop being so Web 1.0
xD
So does that mean
well the funny thing is
HoR is literally divided into the site and IRC
the website accidently shits its self?
Forums are for techinical support, and asking stupid questions
proheristation - I've decided that means to put off until yesterday.
the site is very different to the IRC
and is almost sort of run by different people
Sneas, Altair and I run the IRC
perhaps a bit of both
with Altair and me helping with the technical stuff
Hmm
/me shrugs
they remain as one though
male
Nobody knows
Gay?
Oh
And I am the font of knowledge on setting up bind. :P
Possibly
you're not thinking of having sex with him, amirite?
/me hides
hi nick
.......
(He acts like a girl ;p )
YES
XD dari
He totally doews
/me SLAPS HML HARD

So you can tell what's female and what's male? o3o
What about a hermaphorite?
Easy
Bind is too pro for you then. :P
Male Herm or Female herm?
HAH
14what's up?
THERE IS NO PERFECTLY INBETWEEN
Typhlosion; that depends
But, yeah
are you considering what comes first
I want Ho-Oh sexxings
>:|
hi tr
Hyper is just making fun of me and my gf
Totally :P
;_;
14hey Kosovo
Lies ;(
14o.o
TRUTH
Shiny doesn't much tolerate the jokes here :P
yeah
Who was joking? :o
o.o
what
apparently you need a static IP though
14what?
almost like two states in a nation
Texas and New York
lol the only rules I would enforce here
You enforce rules?
would be "don't be an annoying retard" and "don't attack the network"
haha xD
To run it, or for the redirect IP?
redirect, dari
Because you can just have it redirect on an IP range.
Hyper hates me and Starlit ;_;
second one, yeah
I do not hate you
I just dislike all the drama I hear from it >.>
But beh
03I just hate when people act like 3 year olds
03:P
>_>
Drama, i dont bring it here
SHO? o.o
Because, Longnameislong
oh
lol, just call him Shiny
look at the chat
now back to you
look at the chat
now up at the sky
hah
yeah okay okay I know
Can you really
you don't have to mother me >:(
I'm an immature bitch!
Well thats because I dont have tits

Hey
Altair lurks
04lol my house's internet crashed on me
10lurklurklurk
inb4 Altair or NS stabs the other to PM XD
it happens
buggy firmware in routers can be the cause
Buggy XP laptop and drivers causes that to happen with wireless, but I can't fix it anyway
one cause
but remember routers also have embedded microprocessors and firmware
derp
I flashed my router firmware to DD-WRT
I did too
my Linksys WRT54G is running it
actually WRT54G v8
I think mine is WRT54GS v4
yours is from before Linksys cut down on RAM and before they switched from Linux to VXWorks based firmware
I had to use VXWorks Killer on my router and then flash DD-WRT through FTP
I still wonder what you two do in those PMs
/me pokes Altair to PM
we talk about actual stuff lol
you don't want to know
That makes me want to know even more
it was a little nerve racking but went perfectly

it has autoconnect in its link block, likely

Altair it shouldn't
not from what I've seen
it's weird
it's supposed to... lol
well I'll test that out lol
you could probably ban the server in the conf maybe
and yeah you could turn off server notifications
03yeah but that doesn't stop it from doing that
heh, even that would still put out a server message
hmm
03what all does mode s do?
uh
it holds all your snomasks
including +fF etc.
03what's a snomask

03youc ould have just seen that "yes"
03I was being serious

Well you asked if it was better
I said much
As in
Much better
I'm being serious too o.o
03yay, TM09 Toxic
03rofl
03all 6 of my Pok√©mon can learn Toxic
03GO PIKACHU USE A POISON MOVE
Honestly drf, it just gets old when you make countless amounts of jokes bashing the 5th generation just because you hate their designs to hell and back... Bot not everyone here does, so you're kind of making a joke to only make yourself laugh
Also WTF LOL
I never knew Pikachu could use Toxic
o_O
No
03and others do find it funny
03so it gets old when you say it gets old
/me hidews
But it is still kind of old
03-w
lol
03so is you pointing that out
I don't see anyone laughing though :P
Erm no
03they all are
Vileplume
03except Fearow
wb
03I just didn't evolve them
03Pikachu and Staryu I didn't evolve
Haunter... Is a trade
03and I didn't trade Gengar
13Quick everyone turn to the Scy FI channel
03as Gengar is actually worse
03AFAIK
Yeah
03as doesn't it lose its Levitate?
O.o
It does
?
Interesting
13Chrono Crusade is being played
03I think so
Haunter is cool though :p
03and that's supposed to mean something to us because...?
13AN ANIME ON SCIFY!
03and that's supposed to mean something to us because...?
Gengar's more powerful
lmfao
K fine
NOW someone laughs
:P
03People just weren't HERE
that's pretty much what I thought
when I made the script
K then drf
03wait
03Gengar does have Levitate
03hm
13thanks
Come on not all of them suck :V
03I coulda sworn someone told me it's actually bad to evolve HJaunter
03-J
03yes, they all suck
13turn to SCI FY now
13channel
13Chrono Crusade is being played
13AN ANIME ON SCIFY!
XD
I can name a few previous generations that have as weird designs as the new one
Oh jeez
To be quite honest
I can quote this one comic I saw that's very accurate
03I never said the old ones were perfect
"Pok√©mon aren't getting uglier, you're just getting older!"
03that's wrong
no
No it isn't
03they're getting uglier AND I'm getting older
But
lol
There are a few redundancies within gens
/me mews
13drf gtfo if it wasn't my birthday today
Pokemon are becoming so old they're get arthritis!
Tbqh, after GSC the orginality started going down
so they look old, nobbly and crap
I do acknowledge that the few that looked like evos SHOULD have been evos
and with 5th gen, it's hit rock bottom
13I also have it on dvd
03Altair agreed, but at least most of 3rd was good
034th was hit or miss, most of them sucked
drf
Meh, some of 3rd was good
Yes about 4th
That's suppose to be litteral living trash
So
Of course it looks like trash
03again
03http://i.imgur.com/2Qpsg.jpg
Because it IS trash
That's just a bad IDEA though
03you mean like making a 5th generation?
03that was also a bad idea
.....
LOL
Drf
Making anything can be a bad idea
But you have to realize
Nintendo's a company
So as long as adding new stuff makes a profit they'll do it :|
03I know
03Nintendo sucks now
in a way, i wish they would stop making new Pokemon
And opinions for gods sake
03stupid antipiracy crap
=/= facts
03they don't care about their customers anymore
sucks in more than one way
you're contradicting what you're saying
yes this is opinion
03indeed
03I never said it wasn't opinion
but if it's opinion then you shouldn't care
heh, neither does sony or MS
:c
03you're just "I don't agree with you so you're forcing us to believe you" or something
03Altair I know
03I hate Sony too
03at least the Xbox works
Very well then :P
03unlike the PS3, that garbage absolutely does not work
MS sucks
PS3 is a joke, sorry to those who have it
And drf
more than sonny
sony
03yeah I know MS sucks
03nah
03Sony is FAR worse
03at least Microsoft stands behind their products
03I've gotten so much free crap from Microsoft
03because of warranties
heh
03Sony is all
The antipiracy is because they don't want people ripping their games and losing money
03"It's under warranty but we don't like you, so we make you pay"
A friend of mine gave me a pair of Microsoft speakers
However yes
made in 1998
03how many times do we have to mention
There are a billion people who don't pirate
But
03that piracy does not actually cost companies money
who the fuck
Best computer speaker set. Ever.
03it's been proven time and time again
is goldrun
Well
It has them make less than they could hae
*have
Heh
:/
So
Like they need all that $$$
and I don't think people who pirate care.
03exactly.'
In a company's mindset
They can go sh-
03most people wouldn't actually pay anyway
They want more
So
03so it's not that they could be making more
Even though jit sucks
*it
03I like how Microsoft does it
Hey do it so they can get more money
03"we don't care if you hack your Xbox, just don't try playing online with it"
I do both
03Nintendo's all "If you hack we're gonna find you by invading your privacy"
come at me MS
So yes Nintendo sucks but their mindset isn't abnormal
03If you have WiiConnect24 turned on
...Today at lease >.>
03they can and will spy on you
03and can possibly start bricking homebrewed Wiis
Wait seriously
there's $$ lost from lost sales due to pirazy. there's also $$ gained from sales because someone liked their pirated version so much that they bought it.
03it's fricking stupid
03HYep.
Wow
03-H
03do you think I just make this stuff up before going EW [whoever]?
03inb4yes
03I do my research before I hate stuff./
I buy games that I like from companies I like - I generally only pirate things I would never actually buy.
03I have a good reason for hating the companies I hate.
That's fair
03like I bought B/W
Same DRF
/me returns
WB
03I buy games that actually make it worth the money
Same with Dari
wb
03but paying $50 for Pok√©mon Battle Revolution
I only pirate stuff that is way too overpriced.
03worse mistake of my life
Actually, I never pirate games
03that thing isn't even worth 50 CENTS
03let alone dollars
Bethesda FTW, they release the software they use to make their games.
well, with the exception of some Xbox games
LOL Bethesda
PKBR is battleing only
they f*cked up oblivion's engine
03I know, it's stupid
03it shoulda just been wiiware
if they do that to skyrim
Who made that desicion?
Thanks Altair
Also, I don't buy stuff where the legitimate buyer faces worse annoyances then a pirate.
people are going to rage
03I was all OMG THIS IS GOING TO BE LIKE POK√âMON XD
03but nope
03it's not
03at all
03I wasted a good $50 on that s***
I wish it was
;.;
03so yeah, products that don't deserve the money
03plus
03how much do you think it actually costs Nintendo to make a Wii disc
However, if something I /really/ want has utter horrible DRM, I will - if I enjoy the series - buy the DRM'd version... and play the pirated version.
03probably about $2?
03but yet they charge $50
03NOPE.AVI
03EW DRM
03I refuse to buy stuff that has DRM
Btw I descovered a while ago that Nintendo cares for you so they can get money :P
Becuase screw the blev DRM that breaks your PC.
03unless there's a way to remove that DRM
03like iTunes
03I have a decrypter
why buy music
As in, they make good main-series games because good gemes sell
03so Apple can go kiss my shiny metal butt
o_o
*games
03Altair did I ever say music
Again, I only buy crap with DRM if I can get the non-DRM version.
movies?
03stuff you can't get elsewhere
03mainly TV shows
03they have stuff like Fairly OddParents complete seasons
03XD
I wonder how long till Sony GTFO the PS3 and start on their next console.
03also
oh lol

03speaking of that Earthquake
so drf got the old apple TV, which isn't nerfed liek the new wan.
03you know what made me laugh
?
03Nintendo was all
I heard something about the day being altered by 1/1000th of a second
03"That earthquake isn't going to affect the 3DS launch because they're all made in China"
That "POK√âMON EVERYWHERE?"
03I'm all LOL MADE IN CHINA
and my mom was like ZOMG!?!?
...
ROFL
03yeah
03they basically came out and said that
03true story
LOL
lol
Okay
03besides renting videos
Nintendo is officially made by careless people
03that thing's been sitting collecting dust since I rented the two Pok√©mon films
03and School of Rock
XD]
Best use.. ever
nintendo doesn't care, why should they?
They don't care if their designs get more rehashes than normal
x-x
03I was considering selling it off to some n00b fanboy but I figured in case they ever release more Pok√©mon movies..
Or if they look like retards in public
/me runs
They just want their cadh
Cash
i mean, seriously
Since when did this happen D:
or other exclusive issh
they can resell something like a pro
03since the Wii came out
03more or less
Oh yes since Diamond
Yeah
NDS - DS Lite- DSi - DSi XL
03Dude
03DSi XL is the most awesome thing ever
03don't be hating
DSiXL is pro
yeah ;(
The "Nintendo Revolution" was them changing their ways
03it's like Nintendo's version of the iPad
/me hides
03but seriously I like the DSi XL
But better!?
Heh
Same, I don't need to use my glasses when playing
The DSi XL is for people who strain their eyes looking at the pixels
But seriously... all they did was resize it.
/me flees~
And I can read fanfics ar night <3
Yes Altair
*at
Still don't get the point of the iPad - it's like my iPod, but it doesn't fit in my pocket? DX
It's a DS with a bigger screen
Aka: Most geeks
But people drool over it
X.x
Well my DSLight was dying anyway ;(
Same thing with the GBA line, with the SP and Micro
So, why not keep my DSLight for my GBA games, my GBA-Sp for my GB/GBC games?~
damt,
SP lol
Mirco was stupid
AFX STOP CRASHING!
mine is...somewhere
The 3DS on the other hand has the glassesless 3D with a D-pad (finally) and accellerometer
anyone want it?
I have four SPs
And higher pixel ratio
3DS seems kinda cool
Yeah
Dual camera :3
D-pad is refreshing
Somone who actually likes the 3DS
Cameras lol
I find it annoying that you actually have to go to a demonstration to see how well the 3DS works.
3D pics and movies and AR stuff
I can take a picture of myself
IN THREEEEEEEE DEEEEEEEE
/me hides
Plus other fun things
I know.
Cameras can't record what the eyes can see
I'd like to see how well it works, but CBA going somewhere specifically to find out.
Accurately
I mean
Blah
That's not worth my time. XD
^
Fair enough :3
I won't be getting it due to price
I'm getting it anyway because of the new games getting listed for it and such

Not what you said, but the fact that it is
Wii seemed great when it first came out, but did anyone just stop using it after a while?
I think it's because their skin absorbs the IR or something
I.
Homebrew on Wii FTW
I find that I much prefer playing games with a proper controller.
Classic controller <3
Or on PC.
And GC controller <333
I rarely play games now, but GC controller FTW
I haven't used my Wii since... my house was hit by lightning and half it was burnt.

Which has been a year ago

Why would you want that...?
Ah
12like your beginning pokemon
Well
12would be really hard to EV train
lol
Now there's wings
12those don't remove EVs
Just use your bike
12they add them
And ride accross the bridge
Get wings
Add EVs
:>
12that's besides the point
12they shouldn't remove something like that
Well no harm having greater EVs for backup no?
12huh

false-flame!
10and I don't feel comfortable getting it laminated
12someplace that mostly deals in selling cards and such
Made of lies
03I have like 100 trading card protective sleeves
12laminating would ruin the card :P
lol
03that I'm never going to use because I don't use trading cards

12drf jumbo card
i claim all rights to the room false-flame!
10DRF, this card is different
!shipping
bawwwwwww
!shipping
10It's the size of almost 4 Pokemon cards combined
he thinks we're fake ):
03LOLwut
lmao
12they are like 5-8 times the size of a normal card
o_O
i just took the room
03then cut it into 4ths
/me runs
10No
12well
10that ruins it

03I was joking, sheesh XD
12department stores like wal-mart might have it
10Ok
i already have 1 person
that just left
12there are large heavy plastic cases
03inb4 Wall to Wall Mart
12that you can just slide the card into
- You are now in #false-flame
- Zealot joined
<Zealot>lol?
- Zealot left

12if you really want to go hardcore you can buy a picture frame for it
12XD
lol
ANYWAYS
10Nah
03ugh
03I wish who made DVD cases besides Amaray
03I mean like
10Btw
03brand names
come to #Blargetpalace on Quakenet
10how much is that Zorua and Celebi card worth?
03I know Viva Elite is who makes the Blu-Ray cases usually
its like 4 people
03and those are the same style as the DVD cases
okay
12i'm not sure
12probably not much
03but googling "viva elite dvd case" turns up nothing x.x
10Because I want to find the best deal
12it was just relased a couple weeks ago
10Which is eBay for $14
wait, NS is on Quakenet?
Lol
I'll be disconnecting rather quickly
10though I can't buy from there
D::
12lol
but I'll be back in 3 days
12me and my friends were laughing about the fact that the card might go up in price
bbl
10It will
12because you have to watch the entire zoroark movie to get it
10because it's limited edition
- junglist-834 joined
10Oh..
10Nevermind
12it was just a joke
10the $14 was only the start of a bidding price
oh lol
12because most of my friends REALLY didn't want to watch the movie
hmmmm
10Buy It Now price is $60 ._.
i are got bot kicked
03ew auctions
XD
03I basically consider the BIN price to be the price
03speaking of auctions
/me checks the item he has for sale
12i guess 60 dollars is.... decent
03darn, still only one bit
03at the starting price of $10 LOL
07wow
12i'm not sure how many mall tours opened up around the country
07that's the only one up though

12you went to the 10th ann pokemon tour didn't you?
;o
channel expanded
03Yeah
03I did
03it was the only one within 100 miles of me x.x
I think everyone remembers when we only had around 20 or less constant
03someone call Nintendo and tell them to have more fricking events near Detroit
03as I'd go
or most regulars do
07they aren't worth /that/ much
12did you get the space center card?
xD
now we're like...more than double
10Well
07if you search with an &, there's one buy it now for 18
03Umbreon, no
03I didn't see they giving away cards
12shame
03also EW
03the hallway reeks of beer
03and I hear drunken idiots everywhere
03back to locking myself in my room
12it's pretty high priced
03I just had to go out int he hall to throw stuff out XD
10Kyu, I'm not allowed to use eBay
03o.o
03what ARE you allowed to use then
10Amazon
10XD
03I've relayed stuff for people before, I can buy it and send it to you for a price :P
03well
Amazon ,3
03I mean, for the price it actually costs XD
03plus how much I have to pay to ship
10Hm
10maybe
12i should of charged drf for shipping XD
12when i gave him those games
03LOL
10I dunno how I could receive it before my parents see
03yeah yeah
10and go like, "WTF IS THIS"
03well
10"YOU GIVING AWAY YOUR ADDRESS TO PPL ONLINE"
10:P
12what's done is done
12i have bad habits of doing dumb stuff
Lolparents
03Skylands well
lol
12i had one of those pokemon thinkchip stadiums
03do your parents get the mail before you get home from school
10Yeh
12i sold it to a friend for 4 dollars along with a couple thinkchip pokedex's and a bunch of thinkchips
10I was thinking
03oh
03that fails then
03well
10You could put it up on Amazon
03I could just not put my return address
12go on amazon and they are selling just the stadium alone for 90 dollars
10and I could buy it from there
03it's not actually required
10oh?
03to have a return address
03XD
03it's generally just common courtesy
10They might still question where I got it from, though
03but I've done it a lot
03just say you bought it on Amazon
10and Idk how I'd pay you back x.x
03because like
03if you buy stuff on Amazon Marketplace
03it's gonna come from some random person
10so they might think I stole theirs or something
03so you would ask your parents to get it for you?
10Probably
03hm
03I dunno then
03but I'd be willing to relay if needed XD
10I'll figure out some way to make this work
10I need a legit excuse
/me buuuuuuurps
10a believable one
03OK
03well you knwo where to find me
;o
13FLOOFY SKY!
Couldn't you ask one of your friends too have them recieve whatever you're buying? |D
/me huggles
/me jumps into the conversation
10 days until 3DS :P
/me hides
10Eh
03I just mailed the stuff to a friend of his
03XD
10My friends most likely aren't willing to do it
Huzzah!
D:
You have horrible friends
04^
/me runs
10They can be
04Lc
04*:c
10Another thing, whenever we buy off Amazon, my dad makes the deliver to his workplace
10So if it were to show up at the house without him knowing, he'd find it suspcious
10suspicious*
10so Idk
10Perhaps I should go find a cardboard box and give it an address
lol im gonna be on radio 2 times this week xD

10and they asked for an address for prize delivery
yeah
04maybe
I'm live on Thrusday Night Live or what is now my show for this week
10I'm sorta scared that my mum won't trust me
03Heh
04that's fair
10She always says, "You never win those things anyway"
and then my normal Saturday Show on Radio Nintendo
10also, if that is the case
10How would I pay you back?
04lolz
Which i have a somewhat big announcement regarding that
03um
03mail me cash? XD
03or I dunno
i didnt know you were on XD
04loldrf
10Mailing cash is unsafe in most conditions
04my ROM is sooo slower than my actual card
03true, but I've done it
04When trading
10Using a check could work
04it ends a second or two after the official copy
04XD
10But I don't have those yet
03hm
wb
wb
03or you could just tell your mom the truth and say one of your friends has a Pok√©mon card they're willing to sell and you want it
03or something
03o.o
I bet they'll laugh :(
14what's going on?
10As soon as the words "online friend" comes up in what I say
10Mum would rage
Same x.x
03heh
03oh
03I know what you could do
03they have Krogers where you live, right?
10Yeh
Because 100% of all IRC is child molesters
03Kroger sells pre-paid Visa cards
Yup
03that you could just go buy using cash
03and pay that way
03XD
I molest children ;D
03that's how I did it in high school
04o3o
03before I got a debit card
Yet you're a child
not just Kroger but other stores too
03well yeah
03but some stores sell ones that don't work online
03like CVS and Rite-Aid have Vanilla Gift Card, taht doesn't work online
10How am I supposed to buy one with my parents around? I don't drive yet
thanks
03Kroger's do
HML, it could just be someone younger than me :'D
03oh
03dunno
03got any friends who can drive? XD
the Walmart ones do too
10Nope :/
And I'm 14 :'''D
10I'm the oldest of my friends
XD
Weird
03you're digging your own grave there
Totally
03and hm
03I dunno then
:'D
10If only I could send my parents away on a vacation trip for a week or so... /shot
12lol
14XD
/me nommed
12Why not get a P.O. Box?
10That requires asking my parents to drive me up there
12besides
10Again, they'll question it
12i don't think she can get a PO Box without parent consent
12Oh, true
12Na, parent consent is only for people that are 15
12At least in the US
10DRF, not sure if you responded to this (if you did, I missed it), but you can put it up on Amazon?
03I could
03but what if your parents don't let you get it
10They should
10as long as it's not overly expensive
03hm
03well I can buy the one on ebay and put it on there when I get it
10They got ticked when I bought a Salamence plsuh for almost $50
03I'd have to convert my account to an Amazon seller's account :/
Maybe DRF can really become a supercenter ;P
10That works
10Btw, how much are you selling it for?
03whatever the price is that I pay for it o.o
/me hopes cheap
10I need to start saving
03well ask Kyu where that one is on ebay
10the one he was talking about is the Japanese one
10I want English
03uh
03oh

03oh
03that one?
03OK
that card is awesome |D
10Lol, same link
10Bah, so expensive
03so it would be $20.95 including the shipping
03and then I could sell it for that price XDC
03-C
10Don't charge me for shipping
/me runs
03Amazon will
03they charge a standard $2.95 to ship w/e
10k
03how the frick do I get to Mistralton Cave
10Surf
03from where
10Route 6
07why not just wait for it to be more available
10East side
07people who put it up early are just guessing on price
10Kyu, it may never become more available
10If it does, the price will inevitably increase
03hm
03you sure your parents won'
03won't let you buy it on eBay?
10Doubt it
03doesn't hurt to ask
03and if they say no
03be like
12you should make them buy it
03"If I find this on Amazon, can I get it?"
03that way I don't wind up wasting my money XD
12then you're not giving your address away
12they are

12My parents lat me buy stuff on ebay
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkIOlYxO0QY
10I asked
let*
10They said no with eBay

Ouch x.x
12D:
12i can't believe i got that
12What's there reason why?
10For whatever reason, they don't trust the website
10Even with good feedback from the seller
03well
03if I were to sell it on Amazon, I would have 0 feedback
03would they care?
10Nope LOL
10That's how much they trust Amazon
03k
10since they always buy from there
03well if you're sure this will work I can go ahead and buy it
Same here XD
03well
12Paypal keeps ebay safe
03my parents always buy from Amazon too but they aren't afraid to buy from elsewhere
I might try out newegg soon :3
10Hang on a sec
03k
10Okay
10I should have enough money for it, once I get paid on the 26th
10So I dunno if you want to wait until around that week
10or buy it now and hold onto it
03Delivery:	
03Estimated between Wed. Mar. 23 and Tue. Mar. 29
03so it's not like I'd have it right away anyway
12sounds like your parents need to hear an ebay love song
10Alright

No, just a bit more noisy
oh.

well all right then
absolutely nothing
HML, I'll probably finish it in, like, never.
okay then, good to know
the only reason there's a side is to protect the inside
(That was fixed due to loose screws and the frame when the side was off)
It's a side project.

Oh, so I got Black Version a couple of days ago. It's so addicting.
03I think so

We made an Anti-Apple channel ;3
03nah, more like assisted suicide
I think you're the first person I know who got Black
Besides me
perhaps
but they are also breaking the law then too
Everyone I know who plays Pokemon got White
Everyone around here got Black.
O_O
assisted suicide is illegal in most US states
not sure about other countries though
DRF should join our anti-apple channel that hyper made XD

Hm. The reason I chose Black is because the legendary seems so much cooler, to be honest. xD I didn't know much about the differences between them.
!say hi
People are preferring White because it has the White Forest where you can catch Pokemon from previous generations
what's pokemon
Black just has a city where you can battle people
I think it's a kind of soup.
I forgot how to speak through someone
XD
Yeah, I really don't care much about that. I mean, I'll just get 1-4th gen Pokemon from trades.
Battle soup
:P
Hi
Yeah, that's what I thought
XD
Mew
!help

Apparently it's really annoying to trade though

It's only one way and you have to do some minigame to get your Pokemon back
or at least that's what I've heard
I've never done

I think I've asked this before, but does a person eat or drink soup, or both?
gonna be nothing but pokemon for the next six months
Nah, everyone will have finished the game by then
Lolz
And probably both since it has both solid and liquid
Not to mention the replay value of Pokemon is extremely high.
Yeah, I say both.

last version I played was Fire Red and that was prolliy like two years ago
/me mods drf to like apple
I tried playing Blue
I didn't care for it
Only version I played was Red
Probably because I played the remake first
my sister used Blue
No, I didn't
:O
I wasn't allowed to play the games because they were too violent
That's why. It's difficult to go backward if you started. LOL
LOL
i herd you wanted me to autosuiciding.
Turning off battle animations would remove the "violence", right?
I got banned from watching the show around the time second generation came out
Probably not
you got banned from doing A LOT of things until you went to college
last I rememberd
Ohai Junh ;3
Well, my parents stopped caring about the Pokemon thing eventually XD
Since I wasn't 10 anymore
he did
arg
My seemed to equare Pokemon cards with tarot cards, and thus they contained demonic aura.
*equate
*my mom
I turned on Pokemon a few years ago and my dad was like "I thought I told you you couldn't watch that."
ohai HML
Junh, try doing !cube
well
I just said "that was when I was 10."
!cube
hehheeh
the same thign happened to me and Inspector Gadget...
!cube
And he left me alone
Haha.
What's wrong with Inspector Gadget?
I don't remember
Cyborgs are evil.
i think they said "damn" in one episode
and my mom banned in
XD
"it"
Sounds like something my parents would do
They banned me from things because villains said "I will kill you"
and because characters said "stupid"
Oh my God. This is still funny.
Even though I knew you had overprotective parents.
whe
Where's my PM?!
Lets try that again
they'd probably get mad if they knew I was talking to people about this, haha

o;
yo drf lol, can you send me your !ew script XD I need it for my channel xD
02orly now?
yush
i made an apple channel xD
03on *:TEXT:*!ew*:#: {
03if (! isin $2-) { msg $chan Can't let you do that, $nick $+ ! }
03elseif (<censored> isin $2-) { msg $chan Can't let you do that, $nick $+ ! }

03else { msg $chan $read colors.txt $+ EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW $upper($2-) }
03}
Please do not swear. You have sworn 6 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
03yes it's a complicated script
03then you need a colors.txt file
lol
03in your mIRC folder
03that's what does the colors
lol its hard to copy paste it when its on multiple lines the way you put in in IRC XD
you can use DCC
03well
03you could just ignore the 3 lines in the middle
03saying if my name is in it
03or whatnot
03LOL WHAT
03please deactivate that for here :|
LOL
XD
can you create a text file and upload it so i can properly put it in mIRC XD
03sure I guess
XD
XD
I think you shoul replace "on *:TEXT:*!ew*:#: {" with "on *:TEXT:!ew*:#: {" or something like that XD
Can't let you do that, ctr!
Can't let you do that, ctr!
and XD
03http://pastebin.com/5G66Su5b
03try that
03and put in the name of the channel where I put #ChannelHere
03so it doesn't activate here
okies
03and the reason I have that * before the script is for people using colors
ahh
o-O
its still not working D;
hoome
Which mirc versions do you use?
XD
7.15
if both are using 7.xx, it should work right
03I'm using 6.21.
so, should i download that version instead then?
or does the script need to be changed around for it to work properly
03I have no idea
:S
You'd need to recode it maybe
im such a noob at scripting
lucky you, i am a WRECk at scripting
oh
Oh?*
hmm..im gonna download an old version of mIRC to try and get this darn script working
unless drf knows how to code it for the new version
03I don't
03OR you could just not steal my script :)

03this is definitely my theme song
I'm live now.
WOO
13That song LOL
13I usually hate that kind of music, but daaaamn that song's catchy
03I know right
06o.o
03it's kinda stupid because all the radio edits leave the f-words in
03since they can't understand British accents x.x
03I actually properly edited this
13Lol wut, how is a British accent hard to understand?
03don't look at me
06I never understood that either, unless it's really really stereotypicall thick and all :3
13!espeon
06But then again, all accents can be hard to understand if one goes to extremes
06:3
03yeah
03this accent isn't too bad
03but then again
03I'm used to British accents since I've heard them a lot
Hi Peer
03first time I talked to Articuno on the phone I was like WHAT DID YOU SAY?
XD
Some accents are easy to understand
Thick accents make me want to hurt myself x.x
06I love accents personally :3
03why, since it makes the world more confusing?
my 1st ex had a slight southern accent xD
03o.o
Drf

03k

03and you've already had an ex-girlfriend? o.o

03one of my friends has never seen a DS case that also holds a GBA game
03so I felt like taking a pciture of one LOL
i remember those
03I fricking hate those ecoboxes
:503 SERVICE UNAVALIBLE" Explain
03http://i.imgur.com/wZhsH.jpg <- because that is just unacceptable
03I fricking refuse to use cases with holes cut in them
03I ordered myself a batch of legit DS cases and will replace my B/W with them XZD
03*XD
Lolz
Oh wow those old cases with GBA holders
I have some of those I think
a
03that's not even an old game
Didn't D/P have then?
03yep
Kewl
couple of things,
03most games do
Hm?
Volume is too loud. Not enough panning (stereo separation), and please use AAC, not MP3.
03yeah even the new DSi enhanced games have the GBA holders
03mp3 ftw
...
The format is MP3 because it's a mixdown of the MIDI file
Which I'm importing into a game :|
oh
03there's nothing wrong with mp3, really
The purpose of the export is just so people can hear it :P
03as long as it's not like 128kbps LOL
03192 or higher is good
/me 6is listening to 3¬ª¬ª2 Maneater by Nelly Furtado - Promo Only Mainstream Radio O (2006) 3¬´¬ª2 00:24/03:17 [22,2|2,2|33,3|3,3|3,3|3,3|3,3|3,3|3,3|3,3|3,3|3,3|3,3|3,3|3,3|3,3|2] 3¬´¬ª2 192 kbps mp3 (WinAmp) 3¬´¬´
Ahahaha.....
some 128s sound fine. some 320s sound crap.
/me whistles
03Why are all these songs lacking ID3v2 tags >_>
it really depends.
;p
Oh nvm
Anyway
03o/` maneater, make you work hard o/`
03not sure why I like this song but I do
;3
03especially when sped up by 4%
so in which case, my feedback is irrelevent, ae?
I don't like the quality of web radios using AAC+
03it makes everything more energetic XD
Yes
It kinda is xP
03well
03if you make the volume too loud, it sounds overdriven./
03which is n00b.
Lolz
03no I'm serious
03*serious
It's the default volume
03it was one of the biggest problems when editing multitrack OGGs
.-.
03was making them not overdriven
03I had to lower the volume a LOT
Drf
trollface.jpg
quite true, some 128k mp3 files can sound decent or even good
And you can barely hear it on a DS
it depends on the codec
03it's not just about "loud"
03it's all relative volume
yes
And the DS sound quality isn't that high
like, speech vs. percussive music.
K
03I encode speech stuff at 128kbps
in the case of music not compressed to heck
ctrl
03all the Mojo In The Morning Phone Scams discs
You're right
in terms of dynamic range
It's very bad actually
Some high notes crackle if too high
Yet they're perfectly fine in FL Studio
-.-
03what's the point of FL Studio?
03isn't it just like Audacity
03but not
Song fadeouts sounds bad on DS too
What I exported might not even sound like that
Um
Drf
It's more professional
TRUST me
03professional is just a term
And it supports dls I think
heya
Plus
*heya GL
03as soon as someone says they're a professional, if they use a Mac, nope, they aren't professional. at all.
The way it exports .midi files is the required format for importing
03as TRUE professionals use their own operating systems LOL
Or esle the tempo screws up
Bad
03eh
03still
03I don't buy "This software is better because pros use it"
03that isn't a valid argument to me
Lolz
03I'm serious
Because pro stuff can be done with it
:P
03it's why I don't use Adobe Premiere
03that program is a complete utter piece of garbage
Premier annoys me
all that matters to me is the quality of the end product
I don't care how you end up with it
03Corel VideoStudio is the most "pro" thing I've seen
After Effects is soooo much better
03EW ADOBE
03Adobe products are BAD
03save for maybe Photoshop
After Effects isn't that bad actually
just hideously overpriced
12lol, drf
03but that's just because everybody and their brother uses it
Photoshop is pretty cool
12I don't know what I'd do without Ai and Adobe PS
You can say the same with SAM Broadcaster vs. Winamp + plugins
correct
Illustrator helps me
A lot
:E
I use Winamp plus the Stereo Tool plugin for AM and FM micropower broadcasting
12It really helps me
:3
03I'm sure there are other programs that do the same thing
03they just aren't popular
03but see, I tend to dislike popular products because most of the time they suck
I use SAM Broadcaster to broadcast my RN show
03I mean
and the sound quality coming out of the processor sounds quite a bit like $10,000 to $15,000 digital processors
03we've already proven that like 90% of humanity is stupid
03so if most people use something
And it caused me a delay!
03it's probably stuipd
03it just goes along with it
Lols
03well, there are exceptions.
03like Windows, yeah everyone uses that because it's actually good LOL
Yay <3
digital processors will always have a delay
03anyway
of a second or two
03I need to go shower
Bai
03why, so you can blip out realtime swearing?
I don't.
03yeah I noticed you guys swear on that show -_-
xD
!ew swearing
15EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SWEARING
03I like keeping my stuff G-rated
03well
03except when it comes to sex-related humor
03then I go for it
/me hides
LOL
Totally :3
12Eww Swearing
03but other than that, yeah, I hate swearing
i swear on occasion
Same here :(
03I only get edited versions of songs for that reason
03it just makes it not cool
03I actually have a page I made
D:
i am not
Yes you are
amnot
03check that out
Now be a good doggieh and sit
03it kinda proves that swearing isn't really necessary
03XD
Amazing :(
4,1Minecraft1 time
03wtf happened to the bottom of the page
03some formatting bork
03I need to fix that
You can't replace wtf.
xD
03"what the frick"
03I do it all the time
03I mean I say that IRL
What the Fross
XD
03or as Articuno popularized, what the fish
03which is what LL says LOL
OR
What the Fork
XD
12For some reason, I've never sweared both IRL or online before
Feesh
I rarely swear
03I used to swear IRL but I also did a lot of other bad stuff
Only if I'm by myself
03then my mom caught me LOL
:o
Like what
03and I cleaned my act up
03well
I don't really swear so much online, but i do alot IRL
03now that I'm an adult I went back to doing dirty stuff
/me runs
I am dissapoint :P
03but I never started swearing again, and I don't plan on it either
/me bets your mom found your stash of toys
/me flees
;p
03I don't need toys

03HML, not yet I don't :(
Drf?
03she lives a few hundred miles from me
Aw ;(
03and what
Hell ain't a swear
.-.
03Yes
03it is.
But you have your hands :P
Orly
03when used in that context, it is
trollface.jpg
03it tends to be considered "socially acceptable" in a lot of areas, but around here it's still considered swearing

12I don‚Äôt usually mind when other people around me IRL swear a bit, however
/me hug smart cat
03sometimes in movies it's funny
03if anyone's ever seen The Rock

Stereo Tool on FM I have had good luck with plus the fact that it is able to do scrolling dynamic RDS shocked some people when I mentioned it
Silver and I, we are streaming web radio... that's different from FM radio
it is
you require an internet connection of high bandwidth
but at the same time no transmitters
the processing requirements if any is done are different
Nah, it only requires 150 kbit/s upload or something like that
are you using any sort of audio processing?
Streaming MP3 is what I do
I'm not hosting the servewr
I'm just "sourcing" the server, which is in a dataserver in USA
12Is the new mini moding rule in the site rules now?
I guess something like Shoutcast or Icecast
Icecast is what RN uses
thats a common one
both Shoutcast and Icecast are
you can listen at http://radio.mode7radio.com:8000/Chan1-MP3.m3u
let me try something
/me np: Rei Kondoh - Kamiki Village Having Passed Two Crises (Radio Nintendo! (mode7 Channel 1)) [00:00m/128kbps/44kHz]
there
Yesh.
its a case of older technology meets new
trollface.jpg
the stream works with Winamp so you are on AM right now!
wow
when I said I had my own AM and FM transmitters I was not kidding
peer are you resetting peer connections?
OH I GET IT
oh god haha
lmao
cool
icwutudidthar
okay so it was happening here
trollface.jpg <-- why do you keep saying this peer?
trollface.jpg
they are legal low power license free transmitters
under Part 15 of the FCC rules and regulations
How large is the broadcasting area?
both the AM and FM transmitters are stereo
for AM it can be up to a few miles legally
FM up to about 400 feet
cool
AM has a power limit but not a range limit
FM has a range limit
ahh
the AM transmitter sounds fantastic too
I'm sure the AM transmitter sounds like the 'ZRN
more like a few Japanese stations
But ZRN was mono
the AM side runs a system developed by Motorola
C-QUAM AM stereo
ooh
with a good stereo receiver you can't really tell the difference between this and FM
6My school's commenting on Rebecca Black today. Ovo
one of these days, peer will be reset by connection.
then he will see just how it heels
feels
i've reset my own connection before
I noticed some wind noise
sorry
Probably due to my bad mick
most likely
try not to speak so close if you can
and if needed turn up the gain in your audio mixer
The problem is that i don't live alone and i have to keep the door open
so I try to be as quiet as possible
oh

6Well, that's another ticker for action.
so drf, FL is professional, comprehensive, and as chime said, you can do midivsti/dls stuff in it, which audasity can't.
Audacity is still a great sound editing tool imo
its OK for quick things, but eh
Silver is using Sony Vegas if i am correct

individual windoe management do not liek </3

10Did somebody say N? :3
12lol
6Ovo;
12Volbeat is a danish rock band
12So many N fans D:

12L from Death Note, or N from Pokemon?
10These are the consequences I suffer from having two favourite male characters :/
10Bree, N > L
12lol
/me rarely watches DN
12i hate DN
12it's too dark
12even for me
12Is DN a Anime?
12yes
13O lol, I have like 6 episodes left of that anime to watch
13I just got so bored of it :|
13I know what happens anyway so~
10Bree, what about Bleach?
12the anime was nice
12I love dark anime
12until L died
13^
12then it got boring
12bleach
13Also Wolf's Rain, another anime I stopped watching a few years ago even though I only have like 5 eps to go
12is something you put in your washer
12not something you watch
12D:
12Wolf's Rain is <3
13LOL
12i have the dvd box set of wolf's rain
12and cowboy bebo
12p
10Ginga Densetsu Weed > Wolf's Rain
13Whenever I hear someone talking about Bleach, I always say it belongs in the toilet
13because it's true :B
12I love re-watching Wolf's rain
10make that Ginga Nagareboshi Gin and Ginga Densetsu Weed (sequel of GNG)
06A friend of mine has been watching Bleach for ages, from what I gathered it's the "good old" "Fight someone who is the most powerful person in the world, promise. Oh I lied, go kill his boss"
06And filler
06:3
12i wish Case Closed still played on adult swim
12I've seen all 30 episodes too many times
12the anime is still strong in japan
12there is over 600 episode
12episodes
10Cased Closed made a good manga
12Another anime I‚Äôve been watching a lot is Dragon Drive
12lol
/me hasn't watched an anime in ages
12wolf's rain is good
12but the only problem is that half the time i have no idea what the heck is going on
13I have a list of like 25+ anime titles that I told myself to watch one day
13:|
12a lot of things are unexplained
12The ending of wolf's rain is very sad though
13Kiba was awesome until that Cheza girl came along
13then it was aaaall about her
12the ending of wolf's rain has got to be the most confusing ending i ever saw
13IMO xD
12everyone died then somehow came back to life
12The world was restarted
13LOL
13That reminds me of Higurashi
12I think
12that's what it would appear
13except in season 2 it's all explained to you and it all makes sense
12but why did it restart?
12Had somthing to do with the luner flowers
12And the moon
12exactly
12it's kind of open ended
6Pokemon question:
10The ending is left intentionally ambiguous
6Can rustling patches occur in wild double-battle areas?
10Yes
6'kay.
6You'd get rare pokemon? Ovo
10Yep
12a lot of problems anime have
12is they try to follow the manga
13Manga > Anime
10I remember watching an interview where the creators stated that a great deal of Wolf's Rain is left open for interpretation
13in most cases
12but eventually they move much faster than the manga and eventually catch upto it
12then they have to make stuff up
13I hate when they do that
13then they rush the ending :|
13e.g. Soul Eater
12inuyasha was one of the few that said "we caught up, we're done"
13loved the anime, but the ending was such a fail
12I've never seen the ending of Soul Eater
12then later they made inuyasha the final episodes
/me makes Skylands watch Ranma 1/2
10Ranma is so long
12lol
10161 episodes
12161 episodes is nothing compared to some
10It has OVAs too
03LOL
03Pok√©mon has well over like 700 episodes now
03I don;'t even pay attention to them
10Exactly
03but with BW well underway...
03I know season 1 had 83 episodes, or at least according to the home video releases
The best pokemon episode is the one that caused seizures
10I prefer to stay away from animes with over 100 episodes
03when aired on TV it was more like 70 something
03LOL
03I actually really do like that episode too ctr
03but not because of the seizure thing
03just because going inside a computer = WIN
03it's the Tron of Pok√©mon :D
12lol
It's PULSEMAN!
/me pushes Skylands into the pond of drowned cookies
In fact, Pikachu is actually based of Pulseman, and that episode also borrows from that game
03LOL Amazon
12?
03I'm buying both Pok√©mon Advancded box sets from AMazon.ca
03because they've been OOP for a while
03but for some reason the Canadian store has it
03well
03it goes "Availablity: Usually ships in 5-7 weeks"
:P
03but yet two days after I order it, I get an email saying it's shipped
03so yay just magically coming up with one?
03I actually already got both, but the first boxset was all scratched up x.x
03so I'm exchanging it for another
03which just shipped today
/me just realized April Fool's is coming up
03I wonder what kind of pranks the university will do this year
12Mr. T pities the foo
10Remember last year?
03last year they put "I'm lost" on all the bus LCD's
03and some of the other ones had "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US"
03yeah
10as*
10I wish I had the power to do that
03LOL
10I'd change everyone's avatars to N or something
6XD
12XDXD
03Change them all to Cofagrius
/me runs
12i remember the bet people made
12that the 5th gen starters were real or not
12and the losers had to change their username and avatar to justin bieber and such
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/0435e06b-67f2-4112-ab50-84fa2d0459a9.jpg
10That wasn't for April Fool's though, was it?
03oh that's what that was from?
12no
12it wasn't
03I mean, the Pok√©mon suck enough as is that I wish they weren't real :"|
Meow
12Quack!
12Hi Quacky
:3
ALTAIR
:3
/me hides and quacks
Heya ^^
03there have been tank Pok√©mon in every generation
I was gonna pull a NS and Say PM lol jk jk
XD
03it's just like ZOMFG THEIR LEVEL IS 20 HIGHER THAN MINE
Yes there have
NS isnt here ;_;
Lolz
03I mean, if I had all level 75+ I'm sure I coulda killed Kyurem in 2 hits
03but with me in the 50s, then no.
Maybe yes maybe no .-.
03with each of the deer thingys it only took two hits
03to get them in the red
Lolz
03inf act sometimes I accidentally OHKO'd them
03and had to reset
Mkay
Well
03also
03WTF
10o.o
03Nintendo, I am disappoint
Fighting pwns ice
o_O
?
03even with the 3DS, the screens are only 240 pixels?
that was mega delayed
Huh?
03MY F***ING CELLPHONE HAS A BIGGER RESOLUTION THAN THAT
Lolz
!shipping
o-o
03my roommate and I were talking about DS systems earlier
I dunno
03how much the resolution sucks
03I thought the 3DS was like 480p
03but it's not, at all
12!shipping
4 Umbreon is paired with Luna
;-;
03Wikipedia says both screens are 240
03top screen is wider
Wait
03though I don't quite get
That makes
12lol
No sense
03how the top one can be 800x240
.-.
03it's not that wide o.o
03if it's 16:9 it should be like 400 something
03also fail
03the 3DS battery says it'll only last 3-5 hours
03and since those estimates are never accurate
...
03prolly more like 1-2
03lame much?
Kinda
12yes
03Heck, it says the DS Lite battery lasts 5-8 hours on the brightest
03mine lasts like 2
03>_>
03and I don't have it on the brightes
03t
Um
12i'm sure that all depends on what you do with the 3DS
Drf, the screen is 3D enabled
Mine is good
03240 pixels.
So each other line go to each other eye
12oh
Oh eww
03also WHY THE F*** ARE THE CAMERAS STILL 640x480
03that's so 1995
THEY ARE?!
03Yep.
What x_x
Nintendo wtf
03again, Nintendo I am disappoint
03http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS#3DS_vs_DS_series
10thunder and lightining
SEGA should make hardware again
10lightning*
03XD
03I know right
!ew nintendo
15EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW NINTENDO
That's when they shined
Screw the competition
03at least thank god
03the 3DS has analog volume
A SEGA Dreamcast 2
03I fricking hate the digital volume ont eh DSi
03it's either too loud or too quiet
That's a good feature
03which really pisses me off
Would pwn the Wii any day
03digital volume absolutely fails
Also yay
Analog volume
03the 3DS went back to the slider system the DS/DS Lite have
But at least the 3DS got 8 times the internal storage compared to the Wii
That's a plus that SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE ALREADY
And 16 times compared to Dsi
03but what good is that internal storage if nothing uses it
Wait
It did?!
That's fail
03well
For the Wii
03I had heard a rumor
2GB internal + 2GB sd card
on the 3DS
-.-
03that Nintendo was going to allow you to use your 3DS like a flash cart
03and store games on it
03that you own on cartridges
Orly
Expect huge ass download titles
03and then no longer need the cartridge
I guess
03but I'm guessing that's just an urban legend
03though you know what made me rofl
03I was looking at a flash card site yesterday
03the are already 3DS flash cards
That...
03BEFORE THE THING EVEN COMES OUT
Would be c-
ROFL
well
03well
03it's out in Japan
03but STILL
It's out in other places al-
Yeah
03There are already several 3DS flash cards
03though
I need one
03they're probably still DS-mode only
The Japanese 3DS have been hacked to run DS flash carts
;-;
/me runs
03Quack
03go get a CycloDSi
Butbut
03no I'm not giving you one
It won't work
Those 3DS flash cards are just normal DS cards, but hacked to run on the 3DS
D:
03yep
03that's what I thought
Can't run 3DS roms
03well
03the CycloDSi can run DSi roms :P
But
03why won't it work?
03they'll update it
I lack a DSi?
I guess a HBC/CFW is the real way to go for 3DS hacking
03...
Um
Oh
OH
03you're missing the point
03it uses DSi features
Well
03like the camera
03WHICH THE 3DS HAS
Um
There might be new hardware protection that can block the CycloDSi
03doubt it
03it shows up as My Healthy Cooking Coach
Nintendo uses software protection for DS games
Lolz
03so unless Nintendo is going to block that "game" too
03no I'm serious
Having a whitelist of allowed games
03I might do my video review of the card today
03:>
:3
!pokemon
;-;
DUN EAT MEH
So if a flashcards disguieses as a legal title, it's impossilbe for Nintendo to block it. Disregard the spelling.
I TASTE BAD
ROTTEN CHERRIES ;~
;
!pokemon
once in a Mawile...
03<ctr> So if a flashcards disguieses as a legal title, it's impossilbe for Nintendo to block it. Disregard the spelling. <- that's exactly my point
03all of them do that now
Kewl
03the AceKard and Supercard show up as Alex Rider Stormbreaker
03the DSTWO shows up as Fish Tycoon
03and the CycloDSi shows up as My Healthy Cooking Coach
indeed.
lol
03or some MechAssault game if you tell it to not run in DSi-enhanced mode
Nintendo would have to implement a checksum whitelist.
03well
03they DID, not sure how
03as with the DSi's 1.4.1 update, it broke all my flash cards
03but of course they all had updates
03AceKard used to be Danny Phantom
03that no longer worked
03Supercard used to be Star Wars Lethal Alliance
03both became Alex Rider Stormbreaker after the update, which made them work again.
03the CycloDSi wasn't affected as that thing's brand new anyway LOL
;o
Nintendo did make a last minute hardware fix to cyclodsi on EU/US 3DS's according to some rumors
03hm
03well we'll have to see
03but see, even if they did, the CycloDSi comes with a firmware updater dongle
03that plugs into USB
03so all they'd have to do is just make a new firmware that gets around the block
03:P
Personally i think the way to go is a Custom FirmWare or Homebrew Channel on the 3DS.
03that's what the Supercard did, and I'm sure they'll do it again
03same here
03but there also should have been a homebrew channel on the DSi
.c.
!shipping
ddddd
fffff
03the problem is, nobody has figured out how to run unsigned code on it.
Progress have been made though.
Hm
03so the best they can do is copy the boot sector of retail DS games that are on the whitelist, and then stick their own code in them
Homebrew channel for 3DS...
Using the DSiware game Sudoku, which Nintendo pulled out of the shop within 24 hours
That'd actually be pretty awesome.
03the only reason the CycloDSi exists is because there's a save exploit for MHCC which is DSi enhanced
D:
03wait what? What about Sudoku
You guys know how much the Wii can be hacked with the Homebrew channel, righr?
*right
Yeah
Also drf fun fact
03but see
03people still don't know the Wii's master code either
The reason the Dreamcast could have so many pirated games
03they just find ways around it XD
03I know
03Dreamcast used CD-Rs
03with no copy protection
Is because the protection was GD-Rs
03so you can just burn them
Gigadisks
soumm,
03wait what
But not many games used the 1,2 GBs
People couldn't dump them immediately
03the Dreamcast used standard CDs.
Then people dumped them xD
10!lag
Nope
03o_O
It used GD-Rs
10!lag
[Skylands] Lag with flame.ho-ohrealm.net is 0.093secs
03You can just burn standard CDs
03which work perfectly fine
03in the Dreamcast
It can read CD-Rs though LOL
mb people can make a Wii master code liek they did with HDCP ?
no see
Commercial games use GD-R
!lag
10:<
o.o
The Dreamcast can read them
:(

However
03I just don't think anyone's figured out the Wii master code
X3
12!Shipping
The Wii HBC depends on save game exploits.
03all the Homebrew Channel exploits are just ways people found to avoid needing it
03exactly
The Dreamcast can also read CD-Rs
XD
03well there was also Bannerbomb and I have no fricking idea how that works
neither of us have much lag
3DS games is like the N64, some save to internal, some save to the cartridge
Igglyboo made it I think
It worked pretty well
Wait
What?
03same with the DSi
Now there's internal saving?
:|
10Stupid storm
12Is !shipping off?
03why do you care?>
!boating
12:<
If Pok√©mon ever does that I'll be pissed
03LOL
That's why
03no
:U
03I meant about the script
03also
Oh
03that's similar to how the ESR hack works for the PS2
Still
o.o
03since the PS2 can read DVD-Rs
!pokemon
12lol
03but only if they're videos
YES
/me haunts people
03so it patches the game ISO to make it look like a video
12Never mind
03and then forces the PS2 to boot as a game XD
/me burns DRF's soul
03that way the PS2 can read it without needing a modchip
/me flies away
03it's pretty nice
should test it
on my V7 PS2
03anyway ctr, what is that about Sudoku?
03someone hacked it?
Yes
03and the thing is, in order to run ESR, you have to have a hacked memory card
03which requires a modded system in order to make
03so it's kinda a catch 22
03my roommate has a Swap Magic so I just used that to make mine.
03what'd they do with the Sudoku thing?
10!pokemon
Skylands, you are a 10Skorupi.
10Eh
They injected an exploit to the game's file
Brb
Nintendo pulled it off the store within 24 hours of the exploit
Sky, is everything ok there, youre connection looks like its flipping out there or something
03what'd the hack let them do?
Run homebrew.
04well
03o.o
03so there's no longer a Sudoku in the DSi store?
04apparently it was something that allowed the system to be hacked
12Bye for now, every one!
03or did they just replace it with another one
nope
04cya
03hm
03weird
04well
04is there any way for the Exploit to be done anymore? ;.;
12hi
03prolly not
03short of what the CycloDSi did
04:/
03which is using a retail game
03rather than a downloaded one
http://hackmii.com/2011/01/sudokuhax-release
03well
10My connection is a bugger
03that does let you run any region's code
03er
03game
03like
03I Could play the Japanese B/W on my DSi with DSi features
Hello
03but, only ROMs, not DSiware.
03not YET.
04:3
04hmm
04If DSiware were to be runnable
03well
04If anyone dumped the Sudoku exploit
03it MAY be
03the problem is
04couldn't it be possible to run homebrew?
03DSIware is in .bin format when dumped
03the card can only run .nds
03The other problem
6hello hello
03there's only like 10 DSiWare games that have been dumped
That would ruin the idea. DSiware has access to SD
03out of the hundreds in existance
03all Japanese.
03hi I'm DRF nice to meet you
And the exploit supports SDHC
04rofl
03there aren't any cartridge-based DSi games that can use the SD slot?
03because I'm sure there are
04"Hello world!" on DSi
04XD
03I can use the cameras and stuff
04also
04FEATHER
04:3
03with my CycloDSi
DSi cartridges has no SD access apparently
10hi~
03hm
03weird
"The main advantage of DSiWare exploits over hybrid card EEPROM savedata exploits is SD card access, *and* the exploits supports SDHC."
04btw drf
04wait
04:O
04Awesome
03EEPROM is what exactly
04Access to the SD card
03as the CycloDSi doesn't do that
03it just uses a save exploit in My Healthy Cooking Coach
03not actual ROM modifying
04Wait what
04ROM modding?
03sure why not
03that's how normal DS flash cards work
03well
03DSi ones, rather
03like the AceKard 2i
03they just take the bootsector of the real game and mod the rest
yeah
03hm yep, just searched the DSi store for Sudoku and only other stuff showed up
03Brain Age Express: Sudoku etrc
03*etc
EEPROM is like, sortove flash
03that's what DS games are :P
Most DS games uses EEPROM
03exactly
Wario Ware DIY uses NAND
hi
It took a little before that game got "hacked" because of that
Hardware anti piracy :P
03EW ANTIPIRACY
:3
03DS games cannot be played with 3D visuals on the 3DS. The games are displayed in a scaled and stretched fashion due to the differences between the DS's top screen and the 3DS's top screen unless the user holds down the Start and Select buttons upon launch of the DS software. <- EW STRETCHING VIDEOS
Don't worry, it's bilinear scaling
Not like when playing GB/GBC games on the GBA with stretching o
*on
03it says "scaled and stretched"
03which implies that instead of 4:3 it'll be stretched to fill the top screen
03which is EW
um... that's actually wrong
XD
03so it'll be pillarboxed?
There will be borders on the side of the top screen yes
03then that's fine.
03how do you know though, the system isn't out yet o.o
Youtube videos
03gimme an example?
The owner has uploaded some videos of his japanese 3DS playing spirit tracks
03link me to it?
i will

k
03wtf @ this guy
03"the 3DS has a much bigger resolution than the DS"
03256 is not that much bigger than 192
03it's still disappointing :|
its mod 32
/me hides
03wait what
400x320 is good enough for me
03my fricking cellphone has a better resolution than that piece of crap
03and it's smaller
03:|
i just can't see the reason in implementing a retina screen on the 3DS where it just eats more battery life

03ew
03this 3DS reviewer is making the SpotPass thing sound good
03People being able to update your system without you giving them permission?
03NO THANKS
03I'd expect to wake up finding my flash cards no longer working >_>
it may be good....In japan only
And there's a wireless switch on the side making this easy to turn off
03I know
03I'm just saying the feature seems stupid
03plus what if I want wireless on but I don't want people updating my crap?

03THis review does seem fair
03but eh
03I really just think my DSi XL is the best thing so far XD
Yeah ;P
i have a ds lite
03I have 3 DSes
Won't keep it very long though
03DS Lite, DSi, DSi XL
12i have 2
03I refuse to give up my DS Lite
GBA ;3
03because EW REMOVING THE GBA SLOT
12DS lite with a missing hinge, and a DSi
03And it's useful for more than just GBA games
03but using my Supercard Lite, I can dump DS ROMs and save files
03etc
I only have one GBA cartridge anyway, and I'm going to give it to my friend
12i misread dump
12x-x
03flash cards ;P
03though GBA sized flash cards are super hard to find now x.x
03I'd love to find a store that still carries the non-rumble version of the Supercard Lite
03but so far I can't even find any
03meaning it's like impossible to replace if mine ever breaks :(O
03-O
03but for now it works and it works well
03it's the same size as the slot cover so it doesn't stick out any, uses a MicroSD card, and lets me play any GBA ROM I want *in* GBA mode, as well as run homebrew that reads from the DS slot
03I honestly prefer the DS Phat to the DS Lite but mine broke so I took what I could
03(Nintendo gave me a free DS Lite LOL)

4i didnt know you can change names
4o_o
4thats great!
I think Western Digital, from Newegg
:OOOO
4so i can change my awesome stated exadrill from pancake to somthing else 8D
yeah same one im talking about
i should look into neweggg
Sure[
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136073
40 for that one
4now i can teleceneticaly send my pokemon to my box?
have you seen the 3tb one?
i want that one
but i havent seen it anywhere
12!pokemon
Umbreon, you are a 3Nidorino.
4drat, it autosends out my reshiram
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136764
can i transfer my stuff from my hdd to the other and the os will be transferred and everything?
there we go
umm
if you use a HDD cloner, yes
errr
4wooooow
4giga impact critical hit
4way to throw off the mood xD
03LOLwut
http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136073
thats the price for canada
Fail XD
4it one hit my reshiram
4and i was pwning it
Honestly, even though i hear nothing but mixed results from them, I would say Acronis software is your best bet, as they are more readily available
4but no worries! Pancake saved the day!
hmm
for the Cloning software i MEAN
stupid caps lock
whats a cheap hdd that you can find me thats decent with at least 150gb ?

lol
4ZOROARK WTF
4did not see that coming
honestly, never go for under 500 gigs. most of the time, any drive under that size is at most 10-20 dollars cheaper, and with that minimal of a difference, you might as well go the extra mile/kilometer
I made the very same mistake and I am regretting it
luckily I had aquired over 3 TB of external storage before hand
4ffff
hmm
4this is not my lucky battle
thanks :)
03yeah please stop spoiling
how much am i looking to pay for a nas box?
4how am i spoiling?
o.o
building your own PC?
!ew spoilers
15EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SPOILERS
hmm, NAS is a bit tricky
03just stop talking about what's going on the game.
4:|
I myslef find it difficult to rank each product against each other because alot of them have wildly different features
and in some cases a netbook can function as a NAS
hmmmm
screw the nas
lemme look
nah
its alright
are you building your own PC? Have you done so already?
Heya JL ;3
heya!
yeah
i have kind of built it
i found it
and the put a lot of my stuff inside
so i rebuilt it

12:)
how about that one
good?
It's a good graphic novel, drf; you should read it
or worth paying $10 more for the WD one with 32MB cache?
C: I KNOOOOOOW
12yes
03LOL "read" "Graphic novel"
03more like look at pictures o_O
$15 more**
2hi drf~
03hi
04Feather
04:D
...
OTL
NO
Graphic novel ¬ª READ
most likely, and I think WD drives have a shut off feature that stops them from spinning when they are not being used
03LOL
03well
03I don't like reading so :|
DC comic ¬ªlook
03XD
12how goes soy
that does...
saves energy?
and many WD drives have a disc lock feature that keeps the disc plates from moving in transit when the power is off
6WB Deli
2been bored
yes
12oh
and it saves your drives life
thanks tr

2o:
^ that one
when it spins it is essentially counting down to its death
same at the hitachi
2haneeeeeehs

that would work
hmm
i might get that
ill add it to my wish list
:)
:D
2kyuuuuuuu

07hai
D:
/me throws eggs at Kyu
now I have the HTC EVO 4G
i have one
dammit
why?
/me flails
2are they okay?
i should have gotten android
YES
they are :D
I have the torch
2okay <:
:D
i love it, just some thing about it
2that's good then <:
04YES
04:D
there is definitely some bugs that they have to fix on it
the torch is not terrible, but it is not much of a step up from the Curve
:D
actually, the touch screen makes it 10 times better already
X3
4So appearently there is a limit to how much stuff you can put on a post for DS
12i'm sick yoshi D:
4there goes posting my fanfic
D; ive only got 1 request so far for my show tomorrow ;_;
anyways, much more interactive too
12cold
2:C
i need moar
2aw
2drink
and the screen is bigger, so thats a plus
2uhh
2tea
2<:
2or honey
2or anything warm
12hmm
and before the screen of the blackberry used to be this thick plastic
yes
mine is thin
and looks nicer
also the keyboard doesntg take up half the phone
!tea
;3
2hi HML <:
true
/me hugs :P
:OO Would you like to buy a VPS off me?
I am an authorised seller
my EVO is leaps and bounds better than the blackberry I used to have though. Mine was pretty much one of the first Direct COnnect Blackberries
VPS?
yeah
Server?
virtual private server
the cheapest one is $5/mo
and i can get you a 10% off
thought so, and nah, I have unrestricted access to my friends server, and I don't even use it
/me 2floats about
I have absolutely no use for a server right now
hmm
/me 2pours green tea all over Kyu
07.-.
and when I do need one, my server requirments will be so low that I can just turn my by then obsolete netbook into one
hmm
2mmmm
i have a server, but i get 20% off any vps i want
so yeah
im bored D;
http://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=15160292
my PC build
;_;
2yeah
2same >:
:(
I never got why people don't just make their own servers? I mean, certainly the explosion in demand for servers must be in the low data sector, so building one to fit that role would not be hard
Yeah
but going through all the hassle to build one vs paying $5/mo
really isnt even comparable

sudden silence assumes yes
wb LL
tys Umbreon
12i don't know why i keep listening to volbeat D
12XD
12the name just cracks me up i guess
night all
12night
v.v early shifts FTL
12oww
and i was like
friday
friday, friday ooh
i was like friday friday firday nooo
x_x I hate the song friday with a bloody passion
Stupid Rebecca Black D<
UGH
Worst singer ever
12o-o
seriously, she just sucks
and i thought JB made my ears bleed, this girl wants to make my head explode
o_o
why do you hate that song
I think my ears are seriously bleeding
its really good, and it got 10+ million views
from this horrible song i just heard on YouTube
._.
it seriously sucks
03what song
that is how I felt when I attempted to watch a Diamond and Pearl episode
.__________.
everytime Ash or Brock spoke I felt my ears starting to bleed
drf: Friday by Rebecca Black .______.
03where did that song even come from
03I honestly never heard of it until like 3 days ago
03and now everyone's talkinga bout it
yeah
its the worst song
and Rebecca Black cant sing for crap
she's just horrible
lol
12o-o
12who is worse
12Black or Bieber
Exactly
don't even know who rebecca black is
don't really care either
:x
thats because you have no social interaction
haven't been following youtube's so called culture
ya i have more irl
then on youtube
did you know everyone irl is talking about it too?
not around here
well
if only that CSI Scene with Beiber was real
not around here = your basement??
everyone would PARTAY
;D
i did hear that some random annooying girl got attention on youtube
similar to that other guy
justin something
i mean how socially deprived are you if you dont even know about stuff on youtube
it's what i call Choice
i simply don't give a fuck?
o.o
it's a very very poor choice
LOL i posted a Poll on FB: Here's a Poll. Who's Worse: Rebecca Black or Justin Beiber?
still living in texas btw
if you're that ignorant, i don't think i should argue with you to change your mind
maybe it's best you live alone.. o.o
03you use Facebook?
o.o
cool
yes
i have FB but i rarely do anything on it xD;
03I accept friend requests from TST people :P
shame i don't
okies
https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=636286714
xD;
hell it'd be awesome if i could live alone
but i can't
03LOL your profile pic
who do you live with? o3o
well maybe your mom will leave soon and it'll just be you and your dad..
that would be my Sonic Character :3
oh she might leave
by death
no joke she's been coughing up blood lately
how would you know if you dont leave your basement...
we don't have a basement
so how's your basement
you are a troll
you lurk in one do you not
or are you simply a fail troll
i'm sorry but you have to be very strange to believe in mystical creatures such as trolls
to be honest with you i don't care what you think about me i hate myself as is, and i don't like many ppl irl, however i do know alot of ppl
but i will say this
if you keep it up, i will probably shun you
for attempting to make drama, which i will say is frowned upon here
how am i attempting to make drama when you're providing so much stuff to "bash"
LOL im gonna probably get some major hate comments towards me for posting that poll
feel free to comment
03reminds me of a picture I saw XD
12lol
xD
well
that was easy
btw, i didnt draw my profile pic

o_O
Oh shit
he's attempting to evade
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/funny-facebook-fails-working-for-the-enemy.jpg
which now gives me the right to kill him on sight
what did he do exactly
?
proxy
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/funny-facebook-fails-mans-greatest-treasure.jpg <- HAHAHHAHAA
was he Glined before
?
ya
lol
03but where's the pic I was actually looking for
wtf
Presea do something about this will you
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/funny-facebook-fails-news-to-sam.jpg xD
o_o
I didnt mean that but ok
just ban his nick
he can't join flood
10LOL
so proxying is a big no no?
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/funny-facebook-fails-kleenex-and-fax-machines.jpg
yep
he's using quite a few
how did he proxy?:
it's kinda fun how rapidly he's able to do it
03hahahahahah
12i have evidence stating that drf listened to justin bieber
/me runs
even more fishy
as if he had this all setup in advance
8D
8D
wow
NS is gonna flip right?
ooh
from that
probably
but it's yutss so i knew this would happen
he'll give up
he's not one to try forever
03darn it where's the real picture I'm looking for
12duno
ya
03ah here
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/funny-facebook-fails-a-trolling-how-to.jpg
03that's what I was going to show you when you mentioned having hate comments
03:P
we've gotten rid of a few fucktards on SurrealChat and im not even an admin there
lol
Aanchal, and Mario_Fan_123 were the major fucks
we trolled them both, HARD
oic
and they still kept coming back
Aanchal ban evaded 5 times
before Tab killed him forever
it's kinda funny i'm waiting for yutss to use a mibbit client atm
yet he hasn't used one
everyone who has twitter should just seriously Troll Rebecca Black
i know her official twitter xD
i think
why
idk
for hilarious purposes
i think if you don't like something it's better to ignore it
yeah
although if you want real laughs you'd check 27bslash6
that's why i ignore youtube "pop culture"
i don't like it
its hilarious the emails that he sends to random people
however i do pay attention to other things
good goood
seems yutss has stopped for now
however knowing yutss he'll be back later
or send one of his friends here
ROFL
theres a smile in the Zline messages

Finally... I can set my laptop down and login to IRC without having to logoff again ten minutes later. :P
Hello
04Hey...is it just my computer, or is that Minecraft account not working?
04I can't login with it.
Lemme try
12yay Drake!
It doesn't work indeed
04:\
04Hey Bree
It's possible the password was changed
04Huh. That'd make sense.
I could probably find a new account eventually
04You mean you didn't have permission from the previous owner?
12how goes it
sounds like a cooling issue to me
Not really, but he did say public account so whatever.
04OH
04Oh*
03hi
2hi drf~
03how are you?
03there's like nobody on XD
2i'm pretty bored atm |:
2you?
03same
03just playing White
2oh
2i just got black and white a few days ago
03XD
03have you started one?
2yeah
2i started black
2because i wanted reshiram lol
03nice
03White has better music :|
2i'm up to the fourth gym leader
03I went through the whole game up to the Elite Four without catching more than like 6 Pok√©mon
03just because I despise the crappy new ones
03I made up a team of first-generation ones and used them
2LOL
2the new ones just don't have the old pokemon feel into them
03yeah
03http://i.imgur.com/2Qpsg.jpg
03more or less that
2LOL
12SOY
2breeeeee
/me yawns
or just rehashing older ones but changing them a little bit
dunno if that host is acceptable
w/e
04?
/me gives soy some chocolate milk
Was never informed of any rules on hosts.
/me 2drinks
you weren't?
lol
Nope.
nothing offensive
:x
but
his isn't.. that bad
so heh
i mean like
if you see a host that mocks someone
reject it
Yeah I wouldn't accept that junk
or something with alot of cussing
then again it seems like every generation has uninspired creatures
generation 5 seems to have the most
12at least they didn't take other guys
12and give them evolutions or baby forms
12like generations 2 and 4 did
for generation 2 that is when breeding was introduced so that was a given
generation 4 I have no idea why
12and i heard a rumor that Munna was actually going to originally be part of the generation 1 pokemon
12but eventually trashed the idea
12they recycled an idea
2i heard that rumor somewhere too |:
12well
12i heard the rumor from a friend
12he's marriland's brother
12marriland is kind of a big celebrity in the video game world
2lol
2i know that
12kyu has met him :P
2o:
03LOLwut\
12?
!define marriland
-!- No results found
!define no results found
2LOL
-!- No results found
I heard of Marriland
mostly negative stuff about his forums though
2why?
superfly
;-;
mostly watermarking pictures or stealing them from somewhere else
2oh
12no community is perfect
12and only goes downhill after time
yes
I have seen such a community
Bulbagarden
its gone downhill FAST
especially since some trolls have become moderators
2o:
and the moderators are as biased as heck
they let their bias get in the way of their duties
yes
superfly
is probably more offensive then your host
lol
12:/
12serebii is also bad
its WORSE
FAR WORSE
12lol
2lol
it got so bad that I decided to leave the community about a year ago
12oh
the worst part of it is the Pokemon anime section
when I left it was a warzone
people were flaming each other left and right
2|:
plus there were a huge number of banned topics
Bulbagarden is getting that way but the problem is nowhere near as big
its just a hand full of people causing the problem
but the moderators are so biased that nothing gets done
the problematic people don't get punished and just get to run free causing more problems
trolling and flaming infractions are tiny in point values comparing to what is required to get at least a one or two week ban
its easy to skirt the infraction system there no matter what you get in trouble with
just stay inactive until your infractions expire and your point value drops
thats really all you have to do and you can get away with ANYTHING
/me gives more chocolate milk
/me 2drink
I am a moderator on another forum where the infraction system in the case of trolling and flaming is far more harsh
basically trolling is a 30 point infraction that never expires
flaming is 10 or 15 points
plus a permanent ban is 30 points
but you can contest the ban and prove that you would be worthy of returning should that happen
because those of us there believe in mercy and second chances

makeshift with tpoilet paper/tissues
I heard that Radio Nikkei, a domestic shortwave broadcaster in Japan is airing emergency information now
part of it is radiation readings
its incredible to be able to hear this stuff
I was able to hear emergency information involving the Australian floods and the New Zealand earthquake too

oh crap, i forgot my show is on in an hour, i havent gotten my playlist started xD;
...why when I try to go on to TST's main page that I get a message saying that my account is suspended? O_o
o-o
is TST down again or...?
13I'm assuming TST is down again, or something
13It was fine yesterday, but I remember getting that message when I tried to access from college once recently too so :B
because I sure as hell know I didn't do anything to warrant a suspension XD

02OK, I'm done
XD
the microphone levels seem pretty good
silver's a better mic than i
unlike yesterday the peak limiter in the voice portion on my processor kicked in
the microphone's sound quality is excellent plus I noticed a bed of music
sounds rather professional
it is
although where it came from might make it not sound professional
XD
I do use talking beds as well :P
other than having a topic of which to talk about I would not change a thing
*PICS
It would've been more talking yesterday if it wasn't so that my cohost was absent.
02Lmfao

10YAY Drilbur

06What ab-
06Hi I mean
10Nicknamed it Rufus
then why does gender matter?
Skylands won't mind ;P
10Because I prefer male Pokemon over female?
Orly nao?

10Unless a certain Pokemon, i.e. Chansey always look female
I play a fair bit of Pokemon music sometimes

I had a Game Gear and a friend of mine had a Genesis

PM Me any Reqeuests you have
1980s 8 bit music on 1980s technology
actually mid to late 1970s
hmm power's flickering
1980's sound technology is the FM Chips
Kitten: how come?
And I agree :3
true
but the technology that is making true stereo sound possible on my relay came to be in the 1970s
How do you even see him
WHERE
lurking in a unreg'ed channel
apparently
ajoin probably failed
The first video games with stereo sound came out in the late 80's iirc
here
x_x
when the 16 bit systems came to be
although 8 bit systems could do stereo as well
SNES was the happy and main example
/me uses Sweet Scent! The attack missed!
02Grrrr...
6o.o
the Gameboy, Game Gear, and Atari Lynx for example were capable of stereo sound and were 8 bit systems
XD, suicide'
although on the Game Gear it was not used very much
The PSG isn't really that good for stereo sound
most of the focus was on the "LOOK, LOOK WE HAVE COLOR!"
Too few channels
thing
Yeah
although I could have sworn the Game Gear had sound chips developed by Yamaha
The Game Gear used a PSG developed by not yamaha think
ok
I guess Wikipedia might be the answer
It uses a SN76477
by Texas Instruments
ah TI
they too were pretty advanced
No disregard the model number, it's another
SN76489 it is
TI developed some of the first speech synthesis chips too
the one used in the Speak And Spell was designed by them
!apple
06EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IPODS
the arcade version of Punch Out used speech synthesis
so did the Magnavox Oddssey 2 with an addon known as The Voicce

02Chrono Trigger Music = EPIC
03hm
03so right now the game I'm selling is up to $16.50 in the auction with 5 hours left
03that's about $6 more than Amazon would give me XD

03would like to see it go above $20 but :/
03http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=200586159233
video game music is MUCH kinder than Dragonforce
that is for sure
02DragonForce <33333
You should broadcast Crazy bus music 24/7
because Through The Fire And Flames is a FREAKING SQUARE WAVE
10!pokescram
Scrambled word is "mrshohiso". To guess at what the word is type !pokeguess (Your guess here)
Crazy Bus is aswell
10!pokehint3
The first four letters of the current word are "shro"
10!pokeguess shroomish
That's correct! Great job Skylands! You now have 5510 Points.
02Why does everyone only know DragonForce Beacuse of that song? D:
because it was on Guitar Hero III
10What Ray said
and has the distinction of being one of the hardest in the game on Expert mode
Dragonforce played in the Hexagon near where I live a couple years ago.
!pokescram
Scrambled word is "euklhsc". To guess at what the word is type !pokeguess (Your guess here)

I was trying to think of the name for a Game Gear exclusive Sonic game
I think it was Sonic and Tails
Tails Sky Patrol
it had incredible graphics and excellent game play
Sonic and tails was released for the Master System aswell
Totallly :3
Tails Sky Patrol FTW!
and no its NOT Sonic Blast or Labrynth
03http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/chatroulette-trolling-gender-problem.jpg
Sonic Drift and Sonic Drift 2
k
not those either
actually it was Sonic and Tails I was thinking of
Sonic Triple Trouble it must've been
graphically it could almost pass for 16 bit
actually Sonic Triple Trouble
that was it!
You know somebody ported it to the MAster system
plus its on the Wii Virtual Console today

There :3
Nah, icechat's the only client that doesn't leave a big FPS mark when i am playing games
up to nearly two hours
O.o
LOL
If running an IRC client affects your FPS get a new computer?
I plan to
Yes
X
D
But i'll be broke after the 3DS.
I actually don't prefer icechat too, i use KVIrc on my laptop
no need, that is what I have a compresser/limiter for
making sure that I don't have distortion
It's professional, but not boring
unlike what many do and use processing to add distortion
the FM stations like to sound loud and distort badly along with totally destroying your ear drums if you listen with headphones or earbuds
or a good sound system
They don't know how to use AGC
or don't use it at all
I use an AGC on my setup
along with light processing
I have a pretty good AGC setup on my show...
I actually have two AGCs
one just before the compressor/limiter and one before the output
With SAM's default AGC settings, 8-bit songs sounds distorted
so you had to tailor it yourself
I had to do the same
Yes
heya GL
the attack and decay was fine but I needed a bit more in terms of level
sometimes the higher end treble can cause distortion too
and we are at two hours and four minutes
The show started 2 hours and 36 minutes ago
I started my relay of it a bit late
There is a radio nintendo chatroom on another server
what did you have to adjust for the AGC
just the levels or attack and decay as well
heh, i dun use SAM Broadcaster
I have Winamp with Stereo Tool for over the air
Winamp is a good broadcasting tool. Often you don't even need to set AGC to broadcast
a highly flexable processor
it works with AM, AM stereo, FM, FM stereo
and on FM has RDS encoding (dynamic scrolling text and radio text) along with SCA in the newer beta version
also for FM mono transmitters FM stereo multiplex encoding
you can build a very simple two transistor FM transmitter and use Stereo Tool for generating stereo and RDS along with premphasis
oh wow, Pokemon stuff can be requested too?
And then the FCC will come knocking your door
no
these transmitters are legal under part 15 of the FCC rules and regulations
wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
02:3
Anyway, in sweden unlicensed FM transmitters can only have a range of 3-4 meters
XD
well I guess if I am not too late maybe an 8 bit Pokemon tune
XD
its longer in the US
WB
The government did go crazy about those MP3 players with built in FM transmitters but then allowed them...with that limitation
o.o
AM transmitters in the US have a power limit but no real range limit
you are limited to 100 milliwatts of power and an antenna of eight feet long
transmitter grounds are legal though
B000000000000000
:3
you laugh at this but bear in mind many part 15 legal AM transmitters can cover four miles
:B
:B
and DONE!
two and a half hours is possible
/me np: Pok√©mon - Gotta Catch 'Em All (Pokemon Theme) [03:18m/192kbps/44kHz]
Cool
Okay... so screw you X-Chat....
i got a 22 listener peak :B
and a relay on AM
^^
I wonder how many listened to that relay?
on my transmitter which I am dealing with
yeah
no nickname for my setup other than Stereo 1500 at this time
the transmitter just covers the house because I have some issues to work out right now
harmonics actually
/me np: Pok√©mon - Misty's Song [04:43m/192kbps/44kHz]
/me Taito - Title & Stage 1 - Winamp

Kosovo, you are a 3Excadrill.
03yay, I now have all of Pok√©mon season 4 on DVD
so do I
03NTSC ones
does not matter
yours are f*** rare
and far outside my price range
plus the Magna Pacific box sets are an infinately better deal
$50 vs $500
no wait, not even 500 more like $1,000
03not really
03and even so the NTSC ones are NTSC so there's no crap telecining
I don't care
I still have them
and they are far more easily obtained
you don't have to deal with scalpers
sure they are PAL who freaking cares
they are EASIER TO FIND
which is far more important than "TV system compliance"
ok
03these aren't hard to find either, they're just hard to find for a good price :P
03but I spent less than $50 on each
again
SCALPERS
03so that's less than $350 total
03dude
03$40 for 7 episodes isn't that bad
I paid $50 for the ENTIRE FOURTH SEASON
03it's like $3ish an episode
its really bad
03OK well I only want NTSC releases
you got a crappy deal
you basically got ripped off
all because of your stupid bias
03it's not bias
03I collect region 1 POk√©mon DVDs
03what you have isn't that
03and therefore doesn't count
it still counts
they are still official licensed releases
who cares if they are NTSC or not
I have good inverse telecine capabilities
so I don't care
7X.x
7I both love and hate it when I expand on a minute idea.
And how are we supposed to react to that ;3

Sweet

Man, it's been so long since I've been to a zoo
I wanna go again
We have polar bears and sharks at the zoos around here, but no owls
people make this zoo sound like it's huge though, it's way smaller than the one I normally go to
02I got disconnected :D
and it was SOOOO hard not to trip over little kids that aren't looking where they're going
I ran over some 5 year old
XD

that happens to me a lot at malls
apparently seattle is one of the least kid friendly cities

/me runs
4lololol
03but yeah there's like nothing good out now
03and I feel outnumbered
03by all the people on the TST forums who like those crappy animated films that keep coming out :/
02Lol
4xD
4rio yay!
02Like what?
02I want to see that XD just because of the birds
03I don't
4same
03and crappy movies like Rango
03I fail to see a redeeming quality about that
4!ew rango
05EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW RANGO

XD
so maybe,
02I went to see Tangled
Rio is better?
03EW TANGLED
4how was it?
12lol
02It was ok
03if it's not Pixar it's basically not good
03in terms of animation\
02I liked the animation, the story seemed a bit rushed, and the songs were kind of bleh
4i loved toy story 3
03but that's Pixar :P
4:]
02Due
02Dude*
02I wanna watch Beauty and the Beast
03:O
03Beauty and the Beast FTFW
03See, that was back when DIsney made *actually good* movies
02Speaking of that, I was dragged to that new movie: Beastly
03you know, that movie didn't look half bad
4i need to pwn a pokemon a couple hundred of times thats only 20% chance of seeing...
02It wasn't
03but that's because I have my own personal reasons for it
03XD
02But that story too felt a little...rushed
0220% is better than 8%
4is there a place where i can fight a liepard over and over again?
4without stopping?
4ops
4yes stopping
4between battles
4but like, over and over?
03probably not
4._.
12dunno
02Nope
4i changed my mind
02I remember watching TV on Pokemon White
4EV leveling is too tough
03screw EV training
12lol
03and stick to Eevee training
02And for some reason, for the next half an hour, the TV had to show how much people were stalking me
4xD
12LOL
trollface.jpg
12what kind of world is this
12where if people stalk you
12they don't call the police
12but rather just make a tv story out of it
03the kind of world I want to live in :)
/me runs
02There are police in Pokemon?!
03yes there are
03Officer Jenny, derp
02Blashemy, only kids run the joint
12think of how many nurse joys there is now
12odd family
02But seriously, I was watching TV and they have some cartoon about me

03as an allusion to the original Tron
ROFL peer
03but I don't know the exact name of the song
i swear i see that "trollface.jpg" alot
4Does anyone understand how to expand black city?
03no.
02And they were like "Once upon a time...then things happened...then Riloh(my character) defeated 237 Pokemon in one day!"
03LOL I always name mine my real name :P
02And I was like, "Why would anyone watch me fight and defeat 235 Pokemon? I mean, do these people have no life?...Must be the papparazi"
!define black city
-!- A fekete v√°ros (The Black City, or The Black Town) is a Hungarian novel of K√°lm√°n Miksz√°th set in the town of L≈ëcse, today Levoƒça. It based on a real historical event but the story and the dialogue are fictional.

12i'm going to have some really awkward TV shows

03Just remember, if you don't beat the game in less than 4 days you permanently lose people from White City/Black Forest :(
4hay drf

12they got bored of waiting for you
02Btw, what are your guys' birth months?

03I can't stand crappy lame excuses for a Pok√©mong ame
03*game
4get this, someone i know doesnt consider using an AR to powerlevel a pokemon cheating
035th generation sucks enough that having put up with that crap is just unbearable
4im pretty sure poofing a pokemon to level 100 is cheating
03I hacked in 1st gens
02Yet...
03but they were all normal levels, not super hacked or naything
4i caught 1st gens
02tons of people sucked it up and beared through the game
4and transfered the rest
02You big baby :P

/me flees
3>Implying it's not well known
Piece of @sh@t
4oh
o_o'
its like they are trying to repel people from Pokemon
o~o
i prefer awesomeface
4finally got my lugia and articuno over onto my black ;D
02No
02You're the ones repelling yourselves from the games
by making all these stupid restrictions
hi lightrai
02Like?
4i really enjoyed the game
4so stop whining
I have pretty much hated EVERYTHING I have heard about generation 5
4ok thats great
except Politoed gaining some useful stuff
02Yeah, what you've heard
12i hate going through victory road
4animal crossing lol
you can't polish a turd
03why are you guys defending the game?
4i remember that
Lalwls
and that turd is Black and White
03whether you like the Pok√©mon or not is your own choice
*lawls
4YOU cant polish a turd
03but there's really no point in being Nintendo's polcie here
03*police
4i sure as hell can apperently
02Because we can't even talk about it without you coming in and saying how stupid it is
03did I start it?
03No
03you guys just have issues
02Yeah, but you sure have to be the one to make it worse
03if someone says something negative about something you like everyone gets all butthurt about everything
4i agree with shiny, we started talking and you guys started raging
Baww, we are so 100% )n0t( right
12i picked random guys and made them 100s XD
4i asked somthing about black city
4and everyone rages on 5th gen
03no, I was just pointing out how they made Black City into Animal Crossing
02If everyone can have their own opinions, then why are you questioning why we are defending the game?
4i have maybe 2 lvl 100. but they are LEGIT
I thought about getting White but now I guess not
4then dont
I will wait and see what happens in the third version
assuming there will be one
4zebra verson!
4yes?
12the only game i had patience to build up 6 100s
12was in ruby
Where is allmight Espeon when we need them
4with blitzle as the mascot
12because of secret bases XD
<3
12i'd always trade my pokemon over to another version
03you guys on the other hand...
I loved those
4i loved the secret bases
12record break, trade them back then make them battle themselves
02Said what?
03yeah, Emerald was like the best Pok√©mon game ever
02"You have to like the game or else!"?
03it all went downhill from there
^Yup
03no, but you seemed to be having a problem with what I was saying
It's like people saying Ew Chrome or IE ;3
I just deal with it
;D
03indeed
03I don't have a problem with IE :P
4i like my IE
03I just prefer Firefox
But Ew FF 4?
03correct :P
02Because drf, you basically said what I liked wasn't as good as yours
Yeah, way too chromy x.x
unless there is a way to cheat the clock so more people can be in the White forest or Black City when I finish even if its not within four days then I don't know about even starting
http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/mozilla-firefox-4.jpg < Ohai chrome~
03you just have to be perfect about it
03er not perfect
03careful
03if you accidentally save it after midnight without setting the clock back
12wo
12wow
FF looked too much like IE7/8 at first for me, now it's looking like GC :(
12i can actually swallow now
What happens then?
02Right right
Yay Umbreon :3
12to an extend
12extent
sounds too touchy
4i have a swallow
03and woah
/me nearly types /server -m tailow
03I just noticed another Tron reference in Tron Legacy
Where :o
4o_o
O.o
03When they shoot off fireworks
03they're in the shape of Bit
the clock thing sounds very touchy
03from the first movie
02Tbh what I like and dislike is personal
Bit :D
Yes!
4!fight umbreon
/me uses Scratch on umbreon! umbreon loses 173 HP! umbreon has 824 HP left!
No..
Yesyesyesesyesy
02Fine, so you like something better than I do
12nooo
03yeah Bit is cool XD
03here lemme find a screenshot XD
02Doesn't mean that what you like is better than my likes
OKay
o.o
/me curls up next to Kitten
02Because IMO it feels like you're saying "Well I'm just better than you."
03I never said it was, but there's no reason to get hellbent over me not liking 5th gen Pok√©mon
I might just hack a few which are level 30, 50, and 100 to be in my team
and generation 1 or 2 of course
03the only people who have the right to take offense to that is the people who created them
4im secretly part of game freak
4im offended
So SG created Gen 5
4 8D
Explains why it'
02I don't care about you not liking the 5th gen
03http://i.imgur.com/wQNo6.jpg
4you dont know that!!
03there look at the top right firework
03see how it kinda resembles Bit?
Panty :oi
Whaa
02To me, when you say these things it's like you're saying "You're stupid for even liking something from there
_
:)
hmm
03well that's just you misinterpreting what I'm saying then
New CGI- Yes!
why not take the nick
We need moar Scanty
can we pretend these shorts are a hamburger because I'm fucking hungry
it's not being used
:3
03LOL HML you haven't seen Tron Legacy?
02I didn't interpret anything, it's just what I feel like you're saying to me
4i never saw it
03well I'm not
Yes I have XD
03oh
scanty
I saw it when it came out on a rip
orly
02Then what are you saying?
Online XD
03but you should see the original Tron first
03I'm just saying that I hate 5th gen
03I'm not attacking you personally
/me also notes he was talking from Bit's point of view XD
02Well, now you know why I was defending myself, because I did take a personal hit
Hungry for clothing?
Kneesocks and her ruuuuuuuuruuuuuu~
its like the people at Game Freak assume people who play the Pokemon games don't have lives outside of them
03oh I see XD
03@ HML
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdY9OKjw-2A
03and man, this scene prolly has the best done music in the movie
Hi :3
03when they're all on the lightcycles
12hi
02Well Game Freak assumed right about me
nommm
finishing in four days is difficult if you have other things to do
Glasscycles now (maybe even transparentcycles
4they just want to make it difficult
02Not to mention, what other lives do kids have nowadays besides playing video gams?
02games*
4not somthing you can finish in a week
XD
younger players have homework and school, older players have jobs and in some cases families
03that's the point
:3
4you're supposed to work on it over a long time
oh Panty~
02Yeah?
lol
03you don't get it
jk
4orly?
03you're supposed to work on it over a long time, but the game penalizes you for taking too long
having a time based White Forest or Black City gets in the way of that
02Two words:
02Spring Break
03because if you take more than 4 days, you permanently lose people
4>_<
lol
4no you dont
4you get them back
03Yes you do
4through entralink
/me is now away: gone (00:08:29)
4entralink
03I know how the game works
4you get more
03and no, the entralink doesn't help
4orly?
03you have to know someone else with the game for that to work
02I have not heard of you losing people, like who?
4and?
cya
03and not all of us know people IRL with the game
03did you beat the E4?
4and not really
02Yup
4i just go to school with my c-gear on
03which version?
02White
4in the lunch room there are like 20 people playing
03How many people with names do you have in White Forest
4i can just do it there
!ew ARK Music Factory
15EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW ARK MUSIC FACTORY
02About 10-20 I assume
02Never counted
03...
03no.
03there's 10 MAX
03I only have 4
XD
XD
03and I beat the game in maybe a week?
Drf
03meaning I lost 6 for taking too long
4i have like 10 and i beat it yesterday..
Not everyone has no friends
/me runs
02I definitely have more than that
03It's not that I have no friends
03it's that nobody here actually plays it
02And I beat the game in a week as well
Just wondering who you were :3
Well
:/
/me gives cookiess
03because all my friends agree with me that BW is a piece of crap
12i'm cruel
Then go pro
03at least the actual Pok√©mon
And
12i got the victini event on white
Lol
12and just making the delivery guy sit out there
03the game's only acceptable if you use older Pok√©mon to beat them XD
No it isn't
03orly
02I have 10
yes -_-
02Oh now you tell me ffs
03there are random people standing there that don't have names
03I did say it
02I'd say about 4 or 5
Umbreon
03> How many people with names do you have in White Forest <- first time I asked
Lolwhy xD
03I said "with names"
02Yeah, the shadow is over it
No
o.o
03now do you see what my problem is?
12o-o
02No
03when those people leave
03they take with them the chance to buy items and catch gen 1-4 Pok√©mon
03>_>
03and they never come back
Oh no
No gen 1-4 pokemon
And items I can get other places
That's horrible :(
OH HOW WILL I LIVE?!
03Using pokesav doesn't count >_>
You can't!
OH WAIT
02Then I only see part of your problem
I HAVE MY PREVIOUS GAME
and drf
Yes you can
4PSSST
4dont fiddle with the clock too much
03there are ways to get them back if you know someone with the opposite version of the game and they have lost their people as well
That's just a mass collection of items in one place
4for black and whit
4e
02I wouldn't think you would care since you seem to be the person to hack any other Pokemon in
03no
4apperently it deserts the city/forest
03I only hacked them in right at the beginning because there was no other way to do it
And you're stubborn
/me runs
03my problem is that the game actually penalizes you for taking too long to beat it
03which is just f***ing retarded
03there's no good reason for that
it is
Yeah
I think that was a mistake
Like
03no
03it's not a mistake
03it was intentional
maybe the two of us should write letters to Game Freak and Nintendo saying why its a bad idea
Eh
It's like you not getting stars in mario if you don't beat the level with a certain amount of coins :(
03yep
I already have some good points to make
You have proof of that?
it will because there will most likely be a third version
Yes because he's god
03if it was documented in both the Japanese and ENglish version o the game
/me runs
03*of
03then that doesn't seem like a mistake to me
Oh wow
03he has both games
03imported Japanaese
03and English
03and they both have that
03the time based thing
03They wanted to keep it "fresh", but IMO it's just stupid
03NOW
03If they had that clock start AFTER you reach White Forest for the first time
.>
03that might be acceptable
>.>
03but they don't
03so
03it's not
so chime, instead of making a proper aurora in AFX, since I don't know how to, i Made wan out of text: http://i.imgur.com/DGuM6.png
Yes
That's what I meant drf
Keeping fresh by making you restart your file when you goof ;3
If it started after your first visit to White Forest/Black City
But
They didn't have that happen
>A>
03well go talk to bluesun, I think he knows why the game does that
03whether it was a mistake or not
03it's still messed up
03and is one of my biggest beefs with the game
Heh
03because now I permanently lost 6 people from my White City
03>_>
That's an understa-
White FOREST
/me runs
03and I don't know anyone else IRL who has it
03I know a few kids who just use emulators
03but that doesn't help
That's understandable though
02Oh gosh
02I'd bet on my emulator
03well
02I lost everone XD
03at least on the emulator
03you can mess with the date
03XD
Yep :P
03but I hate DS emulation
02Yeah, but it's been 4 months now LOL
03it's just not the same experience
03which is why I have a flash cart
03so I can pirate games on the actual DS hardware :)
Lolz
Yep
But
03plus save states FTW?
It feels better with the actual copy
03well yeah
Because
03that's why I have B/W
02I guess it's a speed gamer challenge
03because those are kinda hard to use on flash cards
Yay hardware enhancements and stuff
03without massive patching
02But I could care less, I'll just take my time with the game
02But now
03well
Shiny
03eh nvm
Just connect with someone lol
03don't feel like getting into it
02I shall be forever haunted of who those last 5-6 people/Pokemon would've been
03but
Lolz
03it's not that simple
4drf, how do you convert an iso to a rom?
03bluesun told me you need like 2-3 people
How isn't it?
03that have it
tired
o.o
03AND
03those people have to have people who left as well
The hell?
Wait
No
03meaning they'd have to have their games going for a while
That makes sense :P
02Well it's a good thing that we're on a Pokemon forum huh?
Rawr
02Oh well then
03as the Entralink thing only works with local
03yeah it's stupid
02if my friend gets it
rawr
02She'll beat it
03I might start a Black save right now and just leave it going for a few weeks
Entralink is local
But
WHY?!
02in about a month or two
03dunno
02I could probably just steal off hers then
03again, it's retarded
03D
03*XD
03well
4it was stupid that entralink is loca
03it's kinda a catch 22
4l
Yes
I mean
:3
03you can steal their Black CIty/White Forest people
>>
03but then YOU have them, and THEY don't
03or they can steal yours
03but etiher way
my kitty wont leave me alone
03only one person benefits
03LOL
:o
Wow
But
03it's just stupid
Anyway
4rly?
4wow
03and as far as I can tell
she keeps meowing at me, and swatting at my ankles when i walk by her
03you can't even hack those people back in
Entralink could have easily been online
lol
02Ok Dream World really needs to come now
03if I open up my save data in pokesav
02I
02want
Lolz
I want Contrary Serperior
maybe she wants attention
That thing is beast
nooo
i know she does lol
Yes
03there's no way to put those people back in
maybe she wants to be loved
03using a save editor
03x.x
but im reading for school
Not YET
:(
bitch needs to learn her place
|:<
03well I dunno
jk, imma go play with her
/me slap britts wrist
03Pokesav generally doesn't have updates
ow
NO SWEARING BITCH
):
03I mean
/me gets laser pointer
03you know Chatot?
03the move Chatter?
Yep
03there's no way to inject your own mp3 in there XD
03it would be awesome if you could
Aww xD
my friend has a cat that will get in the way of your screen, or step on your keyboard to get your attention
Yep
03and DP Pokesav has been out for years
03but it's never been udpated
02Yeah, you can only have it for so long
Owch
03so the chance of BW's being updated is equally low
03well
03with Chatot, it blurs your voice
03so youc an't like, shout profanity
03XD
02I know XD
what a slut.
03so I was thinking it would be awesome to hackl it
Rofl
02Just need a good melody
03and put in like a mp3 fiole
03*file
02Like Welcome to the Jungle
/me shotdead
Wow.
03but there's no way of doing so
03LOL
Lulz
You shouldn't have done that.
I shouldn't have?
You shouldn't have done that.
I don't know.
You shouldn't have done that.
YOU shouldn't have done that, BEN.
idk about that
:3
You know, Nintendo made stuff that could have worked if done differently
03yeah
I wonder why they didn't...
03That's Nintendo's problem
03"This COULD be so much better"
03but it never is
03:P
03the 3DS is the same way
03I looked at the tech specs for it
03HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT
Yes :/
How about
Nintendo makes games
03if someone wants to buy me a 3DS...
SEGA makes hardware
03but otherwise I probably won't get it XD
For Nintendo's games
oh I hate that Zapdos
/me runs
03XD
02I only want to get a 3DS for the games
LO
LOL
03what games?
then I think we would win
ya
02If they work on regular DSs then I'd be happy
03There are no good launch date titles
Shouldn't it be the other way around ;3
That would work perfecty though
let's say your talking on an IM when they do it
unlike Nintendo Sega did not come up short on hardware
No HML .-.
02Mainly just one game that is only a rumor
you suddenly go ASLFDKJjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
02Pokemon Snap 2
Lolz
03yeah, Sega's always had the upper hand in hardware
yes
03the Genesis was a lot better than the SNES
With
BLAST PROSSING
they were always innovative and always pushed the technology of game systems forward
:x
*runs*
XD
03just that the SNES had better games
02Now I want to play Pokemon Snap
/me sobs
03other than Sonic there was like nothing good for Genesis LOL
I perfer SNES because of the games :3
SEGA also wasn't all "GRAHH CHEAT GENIE"
03did you get Snap on Wii?
O.o
...
02No, I can't buy things on the Wii
Nintendo has always lagged behind
03oh
02I have no money LOL
03well
03you should
03because
example being color portables
02It's awesome? :P
03they actually made a couple changes to it
Horrible lie
HORRIBLE
LIE
03so instead of straight emulation
Nintendo did not come out with a color portable system until 1998
03if you hit the - key
03it posts the pictures you took to your Wii
Rocket Knight Adventures :c
03:P
Then again
That's one game
03also who said anything about paying>?
but they were ALREADY beaten by Atari, NEC, and Sega
03just install Homebrew Channel
03and use the WAD installer
03:P
That's funny/weird because of some creepy pasta.
02I'm so scared to though D:
03heh
03if you do it right it's fine
Hm
02Exactly!
02I can't do anything right .-.
Who wants to modify history
heh reminds me of that skype status icon with the pencel, it can turn into a cat sometimes if you have gibberish on the screen
Go back in time
03LOL
It must have got it from people using it.
03well
03I hacked my Wii back when it was Twilight Hack
03which was like the easiest thing ever
And make SEGA do the hardware stuff instead?
03now it's a bit more complicated
/me hides
I did bannerbomb
And you'll do what :V
Destroy apple
02And while you're at it, make me a sandwich
03Bannerbomb was easy too but that no longer works either
Of course
Wait
Then paradox
It doesn't?
03no
Oh wait no
03the newest Wii system menu broke it again
It doesn't ;-;
Well
03this time for good
Drf
03now you have to use some other thing
Yes ;.;
plus the Gameboy Color sucked in terms of its screen
Guess what :3
03what
Brawl
03yeah
03I know
It has a permanant exploit
Yay~
Stacksmash ;D
^
No
the colors looked washed out and dull
Smash stack
03LOL
it was a HUGE disappointment
03same idea
03well
Stacksmash is a texture hacking team LOL
03that was the thing with Nintendo
03they tend to have better games
Yes ><
I don't even have brawl
03GBC had lots of good games even though the hardware wasn't as good as the Game Gear
my Game Gear from 1993 had better graphics and better color quality
SEGA makes better hardware
But
Worse games
02Oh well
03MADE better hardware
Nowadays at least
/me just watches an LP of the game
Dude
They'd STILL make better hardware
03well I know
03but they don't make hardware anymore
True

Was that Sonic for Genesis and CD was freaking awesome
03want screenshot?
03LOL SEGA CA
Niicce, surte l3
Mario wasn't as much
Nintendo should get OUT of hardware and that Sega should get back into hardware
03*CD
03Biggest flop ever
SONIC BOOM
SEGA CD was a flop
SONIC CD XD
But Sonic CD was pretty fun
Yay gems collection
That's the only good game on it though LOL
I <3 sonic CD
:3
the soundtracks were amazing
<3
IF YOU'RE STRONG
YOU CAN FLY

I used to go to #SPP a while back, but a lot of the time, you just had to be a part of the forums as well to really get to know anybody on that channel
SPP as in Serebii's channel
03EW SEREBII
yeah i know
there's a reason I left
/me sees that #SSP is for sale
but I was there before D/P came out
13SPP*
03and now Derezzed is playing
03in the movie
back when the channel averaged maybe 70 people on a good day

Yep
03LOLwut
03don't recally that line
You're there, bree?
12yeah team plasma didn't draw ANY attention with their speeches in every town
03*recall
In Japan
12XD
!?
They said "We looked at organizations from lands afar.
:D
12it was grunt in N's castle drf
03hm
Team Rocket, team Galactic... They were too conspicuous.
12i think team rocket was the best of the group
That's why their plans werte always thwarted."
12best of the bunch
*were
And kinda
122nd is either team plasma, 3rd was team galactic
No
03there's like over 9000 different ways to translate Japanese

12team aqua and magma were idiots
Well
Yeah
Bree not really
They were like
Teorrorists
XD
*Terrorists
12lol
03all the groups are
No
Team Rocket were criminals
Team Galactic were psychos
Team Plamsa are extreamists
03organized crime = "terrorists"
12team rocket
12didn't have some sort of single minded motivation
Nope
12they were just "crime, crime, and more crime"
Wait
12that's why i liked them
Yeah
They wanted to just take over Sliph and be jearks
12all the other teams
12were a one trick pony with a goal in mind
Magma and Aqua wanted to expand the pand/water
12which irritated me
*land
12pand
Bree
12XD
Magma had a good idea
They wanted more landmass for the creatures that lived on the land
Population explosions lololol
Aqua wanted more sea
YOU'RE ON A FREAKING ISLAND

12team aqua wanted more sea
12which case humans are land creatures lol
Team Magma wanted more land
03no but still
03they both wanted more more more
03I didn't think anything of it

godaddy are retards
03TST is not hosted by godaddy

03overpriced domains etc
031and1 is what I use, free private registration
Amsterdam Netherlands
03hm?
03my site is hosted in the Netherlands, yes
03but my point being doing a whois on my domain won't give my name
03it'll give "1and1 private registration" :P
all it gave was your hosting provider
TST isn't hosted by godaddy? I swear the last time I checked, it was..
03even better LOL
Ah
03it's hosted by some crappy UK company
03that charges way too much
03but Arti's too stubborn to move
03she's all "this is the only place that does databases right"
03I'm like, um, everyone does databases fine
03but whatever

03Dreamhost was like
03"You can't cancel your account because you owe us money"
03I was like fine, be that way

03so they just cancelled it for non-payment
03:D

WNMB 900
mmk
North Myrtle Beach North Carolina
complete with ID
but here is the interesting part
STEREO ID!
recorded off air!
03wait what
!revive peer
peer, you have been revived! You have 1000 HP.
k
its a small radio station on the east coast
the station runs AM stereo
as I said many people don't know of the technology
03oh
so the shock factor is hilarious
03I like FM better
03it just sounds a lot better to me
not me
03plus the AM stations here suck
03they're all talk
03FM has like, music XD
blah blah blah
talk
some AM stations run music
03not in my area
not that you know of
CFCO 600
03well there's 630, that's it
yea
03and it's like fricking classic
03*classica
03*CLASSICAL:
03so it's niothing I like
really
03*nothing
03there are no top 40 AM stations
I thought they were oldies
03hm
KCJJ
Iowa City
03I dunno
1630 KHz
03maybe they are
03haven't listened to 630 AM since I was like 8 LOL
I actually contacted the owner of KCJJ through e-mail before
its really a horse of a different color that is for sure
03I contacted some Channel 955 people via email
hearing Gwen Stefani, Lady GaGa, The Gin Blossums, James Blunt, and other current singers on AM
PRICELESS!
03Nice
03but it wouldn't sound as good as FM
not to mention AM stereo too
oh it comes close
believe me
03what about HD Radio?
03with FM?
!define vice
-!- frailty: moral weakness
yeah, sorry
!define lust
-!- lecherousness: a strong sexual desire
no
HD Radio is proprietary
plus its AM version SUCKS
03I know
03that's what I'm saying
after 30 miles its no good
03HD Radio for FM is good
and even in the station's CITY OF LICENSE its hit and miss
I tried for this type of thing in Portland Oregon and Denver Colorado
the only stations I got reliable locks on were 50KW
in Portland it was KEX 1190
in Denver it was KOA 850
xD
FM HD in both cities was perfect
12HP

I guess if someone tells you to "go to Hell" all you have to do is take a trip to southern Livingston county
03yep
heh
sorry could not resist
oh ha ha
don't you mean a resistor?
but at the rate I am spewing out bad jokes might as well make that a five watt resistor
meh
both of the songs i've heard so far are the kinds of songs i kind of try to switch stations away from
which of course i can't do at the moment
Go to bed.
nah
I'm about to soon.
cool
because a 1/8th watt, 1/4 watt, 1/2 watt, and 1 watt just will not be enough
03what about 1.21 gigawatts?
impossible
03LOL
03I was just making a Back to the Future referencer

03a bit better
03yes I'm hoarding TV edits but why not
03this one appears to be the only one of all 4 that is legit 5.1 surround sound
03the rest are just upscaled stereo
ION in my area is a bit better but the multiplex is still a bit crowded
03well, it's just that they show a bunch of crappy shows
one 720p HD channel and 3 SD channels
03occasionally you get a good movie or two but it's rare
03yeah
03720p here too
03ABC Family is 720p
03AMC is 1080i

03bluesun gave me this one XD
03but this isn't edited at all AFAIK
03I like the "holy jeez!" edit
you want to see a crowded ATSC multicast that would be in my area KNMT-DT 45
03ugh, obviously PAL speedup too
03I can tell from The Power of Love
03faster and higher pitched
no less than FIVE SD channels
03wow
I am not kidding
03I generally don't need to worry about that since my cable relays them all to me
03but obviously it's only as good as the source
why they packed that many streams into one 6 MHz channel is beyond me
03to be cheap
because the quality is not that great
as you would imagine
issues with blocking at times
03yeah
we also had a VHF LOW BAND DTV station too
the ION station I mentioned was originally on channel 4
03ours is 31
digital on VHF channel 4
03anyway
03going to bed

04...LOL
04That is completely different to NS.
12XDDD
12i can't see you being a good Drake either
._.
I might try to make a bot for IRC like I was going to when my channel was busy but I can't see the need right now
its dead much of the time now
12?
XD
mIRC bots are easy, haven't tried anything else
although, you need permission from a mod to have a bot in here
given the channel I had the bot I was trying to play around with was named Togepi
and its ghost was Azuril
ah
but I was disappointed with the script so I abandoned the project
plus most of my regulars had their lives become fairly busy or drifted away from Pokemon
/me blows the mac up
12o-O
12don't blow your food up
12they are starving on mars
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t-x5W5jG5A
awesome music
...even if the percussion section of the band that played it sucks.
12i still think volbeat sounds funny
sad but true
given that I tend to use mIRC just for Pokemon channels given my quit script I actually have to use web based ones for other networks or channels
Mibbit I have used but I think the green tree frog staring at you as a logo is a bit strange
lmfao
I am not surprised
many seem to be
04
12what?
but at least for the Mibbit logo I can look at something else if the frog creeps me out

04SFW by the way
12i hate 2 of the 3 pokemon in that picture
12so i don't care XD
12also
04The general idea of it is awesome.
12when you warn when a picture is SFW that's usually a bad sign XD
04Staying at home playing games with a Pokemon?
04That is cool.
04And lol
12that usually means most pictures posted is NSWF
04herpderp
12derp is what i thought when playing against ghetsis
mSL is just easy to script in
it's rather simple
04Ghetsis was a mean b!tch
04That goddamn Hydreigon
12i think he was kind to me
12his last pokemon
unfortunately I don't know how to script and can't find any complete tutorials
12bisharp could of easily killed my counter
12which was my gurdurr but instead of killing it, he used night slash on it

I could teach you mSL

12i know
12i think i caught the one my friend had

12asthma makes a cold so much more annoying though
12x-x

12my sore throat will finaly start healing then i'll get into a cough fit and make my throat sore again

04I think I have one x_x
12i'm not one who likes to take medication
12i have been sucking on cough drops a lot though
12but they seem to do nothing
13Even if you don't like it, it would probably help :<
13Otherwise your immune system's gonna take a lot longer to get rid of it
13Either way, I hope you feel better soon <3
12medications can't help cure a cold
12only relieves the symptoms lol
04Hi AE :3
/me hug
13At least it'd help you feel better :B
12most symptoms your body displays during a cold

!define taiyaki
-!- Taiyaki|„Åü„ÅÑÁÑº„Åç|, literally "baked sea bream" is a Japanese fish-shaped cake. The most common filling is red bean paste that is made from sweetened azuki beans. Other common fillings may be custard, chocolate, or cheese. Some shops even sell taiyaki with okonomiyaki, gyoza filling, or a sausage inside.
!define teriyaki
-!- beef or chicken or seafood marinated in spicy soy sauce and grilled or broiled

so you can go to the rightmost area
>A>
04:<
03bbs .-.
k
you know what screw it
I'll just Pok√©save my Krookodile
It's a TM anyone could have taught it
SO I TECHNICALLY AM NOT CHEATING
:'D
10:P
/me 7lols at her Zebstrika.
10Scolipede is so badass looking
yes
:O
I love some of these new guys
/me haz Venipede at the moment
as much as others hate them all
03That's exactly what I say when I use Pokesav to EV train :3
/me runs
I just killed an innocent wild Lillipup with Reshiram's Fusion Flare
You must show no mercy
NONE AT ALL
7Heh.
7I find it funny that Grace, my HM mule Swanna, is pretty competent in battles.
WHY IS THERE AN NPC USING FRENCH
AND HE HAS CROAGUNK
KILLING IT NAO
10Ducklett's cry is like a shortened version of Glameow's
finding old pokemon on black feels so strange
/me 7lols at the Opelucid gym leader.
7Her Haxorus just Dragon Danced every turn until I killed it. :U
iris?
lol
7Anywhoo, that's eight badges.
03back
hi
also
Sneas
that's a lie
You can make them have as much EVs as you want
so that's illegitamate
Now, teaching it a TM move it CAN learn is another story
And justified if getting said TM is a pita
10lulz
10I just didn't evolve my Sandile until after level 43 (which is when SANDILE can learn it)
...
go diaf
/me chews >:V
10'diaf'?
die in a fire
/me runs
10:<
nah
I'm just jelly
/me hides
10I do that will all my Pokes
;w;
10so then I'm like on the 6th gym
10and my Pokemon are still babies :3
/me shot
XD
Goo~
/me runs
10never underestimate their tiny-ness~
if a trapinch can create a sandstorm
then yes
never underestimate
/me runs
(read: Anim√©)
/me flees
Skylands: in PMD I don't evolve anyone at all
Even though it's inaccurate |D
I oddly find Deino cute o.o
03*WB02(Kosovo02)03WB* - <Kosovo> Oreos, floofburds, and killer octopi...what more can you ask for?
10because Feather likes Zweilous?
/me hide
...lol
no
I just like it x3
Zweilous looks kinda creeper
10wow
Hydreigon is just
10my guidebook is wrong
x_x; HELP
hm?
10they said the Move Tutor is in the second house in Driftveil
10but when I talk to the people
10no success

What Move Tutor?
I think that's Iccarus city actually
10says Driftveil in my book o.o
Try Iccarus o.o
10not there yet >_<
maybe it's an lolflop
k
10oh wait
10I was getting mixed up

/me hides
10Move Tutor.. I meant the ones that relearn older moves you once had
yeah that's Iccarus

:O
EXCADRILL

10Excadrill is tank
The limit is 255 EVs...
YES IT IS
X_X
MUST
CATCH
yay for Musharna kno-
...
03The limit is 510 overall, 255 for any one stat
it missed
Hypnosis
ah
k
OH
03So you can max 2 statz
so THAT'S why removing EVs was so neccessary
daaaang x_x
Wonder how you remove them now...
03With Pokesav? o.o
CAUGHT IIIIIIIIIIT
10also Golurk
10Go-lurk
10GO LURK I SAY
And I mean legitamately
LOL
drf said that too XD
03oh
Luckkers
*Lurk
03I think there are items that actually remove EVs
In BW?
Where?!
03I forgot what they are though, some kind of berries
10ice cream Pokemon appeared
/me noms
03xD
10Bug Bite or Steamroller for Venipede?
squeak.
So
What now
empty Black City
And no one on the internet has a clue as to why it is like that
13Siiiigh
13first official loss in-game
10what is the season in the game?
13Critical hits always right when I don't need them >_>
Autumn
Also
/me awakens
Hi All :3
10because I heard some things about it being empty in the summer
No idea
10Looks like Nintendo needs to do some more bug testing before actually releasing the games...
BUt seems like from a rough machine translation of that it says some people come back after two weeks
10First the Dream World server fiasco, and now this

When you first visit, it is tiny. There may be no one there. As time goes on, the city's population increases.

hi Janeya =D
sorry to hear about your dad
I have a dad like that
it's ok
always putting me down and making me feel like "the bad guy"
Well it hurts so much because he's never done it before
>:
4whats the point of getting the orbs from d/p/p if you dont catch the legendaries?
/me stretches
but what else can I do?
its because I don't like the "features" plus the creatures don't really interest me much either
4let me rephrase that
4whats the point of getting the orbs from d/p/p in black and white if you cant catch the legendaries?
derp...
03you can i9mport the
03m
03and since when you import Pok√©mon they don't hold items
03that's why
4ooohhh

well
I look at the vore-ish
stuff
what
why?
cause I like it C:
vore sucks :(
there's a reason why its called a fetish ):
Pedobear agrees
vore is the 2nd most common fetish
I think bondage is the 1st most common
:(
at least its not as bad as scat <.>
I liked scat for a little while then it died off

Umbreon, you are a 8Cradily.
03k enough abusing my csript please
03*script
4is tron legacy a remake or continuation?
!define Kosovo
-!- a Serbian province in southern Serbia and Montenegro populated predominantly by Albanians
drf, why else was i trying to get the darn script working on my channel xD
03continuation.
so we could spam it there
!define Umbreon
-!- is the second of the two Generation II Eeveelutions, a Dark-type Pok√©mon. Somewhat uniquely, it was the only pure Dark-type in the generation it was introduced in, and also uniquely, is the only Eeveelution better suited to defending rather than attacking. ...
03LOL
03you know what's pro though
03teach an Eevee Baton Pass
03then evolve it into Umbreon
03and have it learn Mean Look
03you have yourself a Pok√©mon catching machine
12drf
03what
12that strategy is older than you are
-!- No results found
03well good for it
D:
12XD
4whats baton pass do
4?
/me mean looks drf
03switches your Pok√©mon
03but the effects stay
12switches your pokemon
03so the Mean Look will still be in effect
12but the effects stay
wb Skylands
03stop copying me
12basically it allows you to switch pokemon
4mean look makes it so it cant flee right?
10Ty
03right
12and the pokemon you switch with gets all the stat gains, stat decreases
12and most other effects
12that the pokemon that used baton pass had
4I dont see how that i super helpfull
12in competitive
12very
4but thats proboly because i dont understand the finer points of pokemon catching
4?
03because if you use Mean Look and switch Pok√©mon
12you mean look a pokemon
03the Mean Look goes away
12then baton pass into a counter
03that's why you need Baton Pass
4ohh
4i see
4i should evolve one of my eevees to an umbreon
12outside of battling
12i don't see the appeal though
12usually AIs don't switch pokemon
I found ANOTHER Black and White repellant
4great...
the only way I can get Togepi is in the White forest
12and there is only a hand full of pokemon that run away from you
4and?
which is time restricted
12most of them outspeed umbreon anyway
you can't
4just fiddle with the date alot untill it clears white forest
o
4then problem solved
03no not that
not really
03just keep setting the date back
because the GRASS disappears too
4yes
;o
hi Feather
03or
4if you fiddle with the date too much it clears white forest 100%
03what you could do
03I can trade you a Togepi from HeartGold
03and then breed it in White
03XD
4the only way to get it back is via entralink
hi
but there in lies a problem
4WAIT
YOU HAVE TO KNOW PEOPLE WHO PLAY BLACK AND WHITE IN REAL LIFE
4i have a good idea
4really good one actualy
4WHY DONT YOU STOP PLAYING BLACK/WHIT?
4xD
4+e
03he doesn't even own it
4then stop complaining?
4you dont have it
03why don't you
4it doesnt effect you
everyone I know does not play Pokemon games anymore or never even started
that does not make it less of a turd
4but it doesnt effect you seeing as you dont even ahev the game
4have*
Black and White are turds whether you own them or not
wb Sneas :3
4ignore black/white and get the hoen remakes
4then poof
EWW HOENN
4wow
hoenn was actually decent
12Haters ganna hate XD
I hated Hoenn
4i agree
unlike sinnoh and isshu
03yeah
13Hoenn = best region
13IMO
03RSE were my favorite
Ruby I could not play through
4isshu?
I quit before the first gym
RSE were awesome
4derp
luckily this was a ROM in an emulator so no loss
4why not say EWWWW EVERYTHING - 1st gen
4then go play fire red and leaf green
4and live in your own happy bubble
4xd
4X
I like Johto and Shinoh though
4fingers are spazzing >_<
Isshu and Hoenn are about the only ones I hate
4what about kanto?
Kanto I like
13The only region I didn't like was Sinnoh
13Well, I didn't hate it
13But I found it the least enjoyable
^
4i dont hate any of them
sinnoh was meh imo
I hate Isshu because the games suck
4but i like 1st and 2nd best
hoenn is the best imo
cool
Blarg.
4why do we call it isshu?
none of them are bad
Hoenn because they were trying far to hard to be different
4^kosovo
4agreed
they weren't trying too hard
isshu and sinnoh are what you call trying too hard
10DANJO
4isshu tried really hard
4but i like most of its efforts
here's how I honestly see it:
:O

and it's yours as well
13Lol that's pretty much the same as how I see it xD

along with keeping Ash's ego in check
10The Johto Pokerap had so many incorrect pronunciations
it does
plus its just notoriously bad
03no it didn't
03what was pronounced wrong in the Johto Pok√©rap o.o;
10the names
03examples of what names
10hang on
10let me play it
10Yanma
10They pronounced it Yawn-ma
03instead of what
10I pronounce it like Yaan-ma
10well
10the A sound
10sounds like yeah
10so yeahn-ma
03eh
03yeah I do too but that's trivial
!define cardiaplegia
03what else
-!- No results found
03one name is not "so many"
10seezor
10scizor
03I say it like "scissor"
lol
03in fact
03I have this picture here
03hold on
10quil-ava
03Quilava's sounded fine to me
10flaah-fee
10flaaffy
10I say flaa-fee
10xatu LOL
03I say it like it was in the video
03http://i.imgur.com/jRu9O.png
03there
03is that funny or what
03pardon the quality
03this was years ago
10Now to point out mispronunciations in the original
13The PBR announcer is such a fail at pronunciation
03PBR fails in all regards
13even in the anime they pronounce it arca-nine
13he pronounces it are-canine
13:|
03well
03I've already proven that the people who dub the show can't even say their own names right LOL
03the example, Bonsly
13One of the many reasons I disabled the announcer's commentary |D
03the 8th movie was a 4KIDS dub
xD
03and they said it like "bons-lee"
03then in Battle Fronteir which was Pok√©mon USA
!ew 4Kids
13EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW 4KIDS
03they said it like "Bons-lie"
10I remember that @ drf
03so that pretty much proves that they don't even know what they're doing
10They were aired around the same time too
03yep
13Oh yeah LOL
03well "aired", the movie was a DVD
03but regardless
13I stopped watching when they changed the voices :|
03same
03EW THE NEW DUB
034KIDS may have butchered it, but IMO it's just not Pok√©mon without them
03but still, it'/s proof that 4KIDS can't say the names right XD
03Rayquaza was another one
03I say it like "ray-quah-zah"
03they said it like "ray-quay-za"
10Used to say with 'quah' too
10but I prefer 'quay'
03I don't
03it just sounds wrong with quay
10Found one
03o.o
o.o
10They said Growl-liiithe
10not Growl-ithe
/me 4is finally back
10But regardless
03there were also some video glitches LOL
10Original Pokerap is awesome
03look at when they say Graveler
03it's actually a Geodude
10Yeah
03Cartoon Network fixed it, oddly enough
10That's what happens when you have to say 150 names in 3 minutes
03putting emphasis on the "char"
03but so far the names all sound fine
03and see, I'm, sure they spent more than 3 minutes making the video LOL
10Obviously XD
03Pidgeotto was said odd but that's just to fit it in
03I've actually never noticed that before LOL
03I just blame the fact that the dude's black
/me runs
4I was listening to my "perfect sister" get yelled at by my parents. I was enjoying it so much because she never gets yelled at. If it was me down there i would have gotten grounded for EVER. I was happy untill i realised she wast getting punished,..

10but if I ever become desperate, sure
10Meh
03heck, with Johto Journeys I would have taken copies
03but I couldn't even find those
03LOL
/me never sees Sammy no more ;-;
03that's how rare they are
because of your "NTSC or GFTO" bias
03and even so most TVs won't do PAL
the PAL discs are far more common and cheaper
you do if you have VideoLAN
03they're also PAL telecined
03if I'm going to use a computer
03I'll just stick to the VOB files
plus DVD players convert between TV systems
03no they don't
03my DVD player exports whatever the DVD has
02.-.
03I've had region free PAL discs
03and it exported it in PAL>

*pokes*
then your DVD player sucks
03anyway
03gonna go to dinner

then again so does the expensive one bought brand new in 2001 here
Lol.
/me holds up a DSi XL over his head. DA NA NA NAAAHHH!!!! :D
:D
I <3 Dsi XL
wonder were she is anyway o.o
/me pokes Ray
02hm?
I need you to review something
02what is it? o3o
http://pastebin.com/mdLPirc3 o3o
It is that
ohai Ray
trollface.jpg
why
its just a DSi with a bigger screen slapped on it
and nothing else
That's why I love it
I never got a Dsi
02ohai NS
/me was stuck with a breaking DS lite for over 3 years
But yeah, its a fanfiction of mine Ray
I never got a DSi because I did not see the need for it
I already had a PSP and that pretty much beats the DSi in multimedia
Ew PSP
plus I have a DS for Nintendo games
/me 4poofs
Baai
the DSi sucks in multimedia compared to the PSP
4baai
That's why I have a laptop
you really need to stop telling everyone to read your fanfics
Way better than both
even I don't do that
because Nintendo does not really make good hardware
4PSP portable for the win!
Lies
02way to kill my lazy-ness ¬¨¬¨
02XD
And that is obvious
4just wait for the 3DS
Nintendo does not innovate
they just follow
GAH
/me Sets Claymore randomly in the room~
o.o
4yay minecraft is up
some one lives
4bye
ew
Nintendo doesn't innovate?
Lol.
>3> and even lol'ed
Anakin; when I have writers block, I feel the 'right' to do :P
So nintendo followed for the Wii *cough*
they don't
They're always ahead of Sony and Microsoft?
Nintendo is just a follower
besides, I ask you (what) twice if I care?
and it gets annoying
and what you think are "innovations" are just gimmicks so Nintendo can sell hardware without improving the system's other capabilities
Nintendo bring out their motion controlled console years before Sony got their "Playstation Move" out, which is pretty much just a copy.
to you, thats obvious
and yet it was outclassed in so many things
*pokes* ??
And whether it really is good or not nearly everyone bought one.
the Playstation 3 is FAR more powerful than the Wii
It was cheap, Nintendo has the good sense to own the patents to all of their components so their console would be cheap, Microsoft and Sony copied them after they did it.
Hey.
Power isn't everything anyway.
I am isolating hardware from games here
I don't see the PS3 as innovative in any way, it's just a more powerful PS3.
it really is
A more powerful PS2, sorry.
the Playstation 3 was the first console to use Blu Ray discs for storing games along with one of only two capable of HD
only the Playstation 3 and xBOX 360 can do HD video
they both work at up to 1080p
So?
02*sigh* I'm just way to lazy to read all this xD
Big whoop
the Wii can only do 480i at the most
I still don't really see your point.
plus its years behind in processing power
k
the Wii is a joke compared to the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360
Which is why the wii tops in sales?
Seems like it
By a massive margin?
wb Panty and Matt
sty
...or not.
xD
Yup :3
After they screwed the playstation series with the PS3
I don't even really notice the difference between my PS3 in HD on a 32" screen and my wii on a 20" screen without HD.
It's not that important.
im not lazy to read it, i just suck at feedback XD
Ray; well its 61 pages
I notice the difference
so I can see why laziness would triumph
indeed
the picture on the Playstation 3 looks sharper and more detailed
13thankiezs
the Wii looks fuzzy and pixelated in comparison
Makes no difference to me.
I also upconvert my Wii so yay me
either your vision is bad or you need your eyes examinated
I already have glasses :3
then you need to get your eyes checked again
I have 20-20 vision, but when playing a game a tiny ammount of blur difference does not affect my experience of the game at all.
its more than "a tiny amount"
its a big difference
I have seen the two side by side before
the Wii can't come close
‚Ä¶
WHOA
that was WAY faster than usual
Glasses are way more expensive than any console, so I'll pass
usually when I read scary things I get depressed for two or three days
and I just got fixed with one picture
‚Ä¶ I love this person :"D
The wii have 84 million sales worldwide compared to only 50 million and 48 million Xbox, and PS3 sales.
has*
you are just a bunch of Nintendo fanboys/fangirls
so I sort of expected this
02nope.avi
I don't really like any of the companies that much.
yes you are
02I still would like a PS3 before the wii just by the fact of more games for online
02not for the graphics ¬¨¬¨
I use the PS3 over the wii just for the controller.
I stuck with my PSP rather than getting a DSi because unlike the DS it keeps me entertained even when I don't feel like playing video games
02xD
Hello ppl
Black Ops is the best selling PS3 game? Meh I prefered MW2.
02^
02how ever, I haven't play'd either both games at fully
While I like some of the MW2 hacks like QS lobbies there are too many idiots who just god mode now. >_>
02so my opinion doesn't count :3
plus many hard core games go with Sony or Microsoft over Nintendo
*gamers
Nintendo isn't a hardcore gamer consoler obviously.
It's a family console.
A more social one.
wow trippy
the Wii is just gimmicks on top of gimmicks
i'm back
say my name when you come back
02lol PS3 reference
>>
In your opinion, which I think is completely wrong.
where u gone
:P
02"the wiimote is a givemenick" time later here goes the PSMove
the only reason why those gimmicks have worked was Nintendo's marketing
PSMove is the crappiest thing I've ever seen.
microsoft and sony are both trying to get into the wii's target audience more than before
which is everyone
02Agree with you @dari
I hated Nintendo as a hardware maker for the longest time because they just did not innovate especially in portable systems
I got started with Sega and the Game Gear which unlike the Gameboy was in fact a color system that did not require any sort of weird lighting
I agree that portable systems just seem to be remakes of the same thing.
plus the game library was impressive
Nintendo is more of "go with what works"
02true
they waited until 1998 to put out a color portable game system
and even THEN it sucked compared to the Game Gear
they waited until 2001 to adopt CDs
02PS and XBOX otherwise the really DON'T Change...
02they are just remakes of the first thing...
xbox introduced a reliable internet-based gaming network
which is why a lot of people get it
02but the console was STILL the same
i'ma go poof
things to be doing
:/
ttfn
02I can't see any diference between the XBOX and the XBOX360 (aside from graphics/online/gamelist)
true, the xbox 360 isn't much of a departure from the original, but they didn't really need to change much, just kind of update the hardware
Nintendo only changed because what they were trying didn't work
02yeah, that's the fun thing about "Inovation"
heya SLM and Matt
which is why the xbox was a success
where is that umm
which is why the PS1 was a success
which is why the Wii was a success

they've also invited to the reverse world because their "charisma" (something like that) has been reduced

circumstance two (well, more like extension): it's possible for a separate ROM highlink to invite/pull the characters before you get to the town
/me flees

"Even before you get there, the residents' charisma lowers day by day, so they switch between reverse and normal. The first resident should become reverse-ten people by the end of the second week"

13this song is just so beautiful
It can also be a good thing; apparently you can pull whatever residents you like into the area to your liking
/me throws Umbreon into the tickle machine
If you don't care about dated events, set the time to 23:59->(battle or talk to the person you'd like to stay)-> If you save repeatedly after 0:01, then only the person you'd like to stay stays in normal and everyone else moves to reverse. After that, just invite them with a different version
/me gasps
/me chuckles
your gasps amuse me
GASPOSOS
and...?
For people who think "I don't want to send them into reverse, but battling them everyday is a hassle," it's okay if you leave ten people in reverse then you can invite them to a separate version, or leave them be as long as you don't futz with the time. When you cross paths with them, just make sure they're in a place where highlinks can't reach like south of Raimon (who?)

I guess I've answered the phone while asleep and had conversations with people
i'm still determined to get you to talk on the phone
sweet
i'm calling you at like 4 am
o.o

Then I wake up during the conversation
and have no idea what the hell happened

He's moving back here soon, I so excited
cause this place gets hit more than ps
NO LULLABYE

Are you going to party?
Yes.
03Someone probably just hates this place for whatever reason
I swear that's all he does
Fun fun fun?
Looking forward to the weekend.

in fact I have learned a fair bit
caaaaaaaaaaa
what
oh?
no
its ky's server
ok
.-.'
k
s
sx
ky?
a person from another server
;o
yes
name sounds vaguely familiar
(1:53:56 PM) mode (+m )
that was when it started
i would do something but i can't fU:
ok
what did you learn [about encoding]?
trollface.jpg
among other things how to deal with AVC encoded video files
indexing them for AVI Synth
oh, yup
\
\
did you have anything else you wanned to say/ask me?
but I still have a concern about changing the framerate
fucking ladybugs
one just bit me
selecteven().tdecimate()
if I use ChangeFPS or something similar will that throw off the A/V sync?
no for both, i think. i suggest my line, which brings it down to 24, analyzing for motion.
ok
I will give that one a try then
ChangeFPS brings it to any FPS, but doesn't analyze for motion, so it may look jerky.
I already indexed the AVC transport stream and brought it into AvSPMod along with doing color balancing and changing the brightness/saturation/contrast
M2 or m3?
3
I have Uso's encode of Pokemon The Movie 2000
I used tweak(sat=1.2,cont=1.12) #colours
coloryuv(gain_v=-5,gain_u=+10)
his apparently is already 5.1 surround
but i might change my mind, whats yours?
I will have to find it
after I switch on the 1 TB external
I may make some music edits, so i'm keeping it 2.0 for simplicity's sake. also, the 5.1 surround may not be genuine
(same for m2)
I will find out
actually I did
it looks legit
most people don't have surround systems, also
Converttoyv12()
ColorYUV(gain_u=3, gain_v=-2)
Tweak(bright=-2, sat=1.5, cont=1.1)
that is what I have
hmm, the saturation is a bit high on yours
I will crank it down a little
you may not need Converttoyv12()
I just put it in there for safety but will remove it if I find out that its not needed
unnecessary colourspace conversions may reduce quality
and its not needed
good thing we caught this now rather than later
plus it will increase the rendering fps as well I believe
only by like, 1%, minor
still an improvement as far as I am concerned
if only there was a native 64 bit version
there is avisynth64, i think. but there are like, baisiclly no native 64bit filters,
except for the internal wans, so its baisically useless
thats alot better
your white point looks better than mine
and don't expect any speed increases, either
oh, really?
yes
my M2 coefficients might look crap
the two seem to have similar tints
tweak(sat=1.12,cont=1.02) #colours m2coef
coloryuv(gain_v=+0,gain_u=-8) #m2coef may look crap
I am happy with the one given before
that looks so much better
you have m2 ts on you?
yes
again stored on the terabyte external
my gosh hard disk storage has gone up
I remember when a GIGABYTE was huge
this would have been 1996 or 1997
03oh yay

03hm
03I'm debating if I want to try to make my Articuno and Lugia AMV "better"

wow
[18:40:10] TheELite1 @#mysteryzone
03yeah
03hard drive crash
03well, I just came across all the project files
those suck
03like the .vsp file for Corel VideoStudio
I bet
03so I have all the source clips
03but
this was when i had crappy laptop speakers,

so i thought it sounded good
no AAC+ then
nah
03the original one, the two Advanced Battle Articuno episodes had Kids' WB watermarks
03now that they're on DVD
03I could easily just redo that
03so I'm considering it XD
what song, drf?
I would have used AAC+ for 96k
03Everytime We Touch
do not liek.
Cascada
03:<
03That AMV is awesome though
03it's what brought like half of TST's members here
03since they saw it on YouTube
03:>
I remember seeing Pokeshipping AMVs made relating to that song
03it is Pokeshipping
03Articuno + Lugia
03it's kinda meaningless now though
WRONG
03since they aren't together anymore
03Articuno is TST's admin
Pokeshipping is Ash and Misty
03Lugia used to be the other admin
03the two of them were dating LOL
or 112 or 128.
03but they broke up
03so NOW it's meaningless
03but I still want the video for vintage purposes.
/me tickles Umbreon lately
12pokeballs are for high class people
/me eeps
12middle class and pokemon use pickle jars
03there we go, all clips relinked successfully
/me gnaws through
03I suppose for now I'll just save it as XVID again and make it identical to the original
03in terms of watermarked source
03but I might fix that later
03the episodes Numero Uno Articuno and The Symbol Life, from PAB
http://imagebin.org/144090
heya
;o
hello
those start after A Real Cleffa Hanger from what I saw in episode listing
03I dunnio
03-i
03but I should be getting the DVD tomorrow
03and then I can rip VOBs
03at the time I made the AMV (back in 2006), it was a TV rip only
03so I had to settle for a HDTV sourced Kids' WB rip which was better quality than the Japanese one, believe it or not
I love how the botnet hits
1 minute after I have to leave -.-
four or five years ago
03yep
03I know
03that's how old the video is
/me sticks Multi
I am just astonished its been that long
wonderful
the AB JAP raws may had chroma leaking issues.
meh
shit increased from 0 to 461 in a few hours
fucking gay fuck
03yeah
also we need a faster dnsbl
03these were from um
03that one dude in #PM
03who had a way to cap HDTV back in 2006 LOL
thats not HDTV, thats analogue, then
03no, it's HDTV
one of the few HDTV capture cards I know of from back then was made by Hauppage
03it was WB HD
03well
03it wasn't 720p
03he downscaled them
no, i'm ta;lomg about the japanese cap
03but the watermark actually said WB HD
03oh.,
03that's what I'm saying
03the WB ones were HDTV
03hence why I used them over Japanese TV

about a month or two ago we had the same problem
was it an attack?
except it was a lot more frequent

Didn't get it

ohai
I so want to install VNC on this ubuntu computer
wb
Have to enable remote connections

well
the thing is
when I direct port 5900 to it
it lets you in without a password
and I don't think x11VNC/whatever is even running
oh

wtf
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7503868/Screenshot-32.png - Hmm.

Trollface.win
Hi anth
:)
I heard there was a lack of administrators here at TST
so I have come
i even tried ssl
TO TAKE OVER
/me takes out two two-handed swords and charges
/me steals scouts mother
:S
but no seriously
did you try shaymin?
where did Arti and Aurororororora go?
i made it join ecnet and it connected fine
03they left
Hmmm
yes
how come?
did you try shaymin
?
/me pounces Nick
anyways
brb
12's shadow
03long stor.y
03er, move that period over one LOL
lol
/me somehow avoids
They ragedquit to say the least :3
ragequit? D:
We dun liek noobies, lets gtfo
Or something or other like that
5......
basically yes it seems
12Aurora and Articuno are still at the forums however
5That's kind of a harsh statement.
its stupid
/me agrees with RP4L
Okay, time to go
if you want ANY community to grow the best thing you can do is to accept and welcome new people
BRB, dinnah
12They just left the chat
5They just left /this/ chat, if I understand.
12Yes
12They have there own server now
plus they are isolating themselves
12It‚Äôs private though
Chatkill time!
Hdtytifkpgudrdwjdha
hence why I said isolating themselves
12They are
12isolating themselves very much so
5Maybe they're just stressed..?
12There trying to bring back the so called Good ol days
trollface.jpg
10They are, RP4L
10and they're tired of trying to fix it
best version
yeah alot of poeple from "the good ol days" left
5**December
I left too because they left
but I have COME BACK FROM THE DEAD
5Do you remember Icester? And Tanner? (Those were looong ago days. xD)
LOL yeah
and Snowsongg
and Gullking (althought I hate that guy)
still get time out
i left for somewhat different reasons
5Gullking kinda got on my nerves lol...
Arti & aurora couldn't acknowledge that TST chat changes over time, and have no understanding that being a server owner or IRCop doesn't mean what they think it means.
I also underestimated WoW's addictingness
I thought it was gonna be bad but then I got absorbed
and what did Gullking do to you?
5Eh, nothing specific. I don't even really remember. Doesn't matter.
that hit the nail on the head
ow
IRC channels change over time too
the nail hit my foot x-x
people show up and people leave
its a fact of life
Maxi and Bluewing
miss them
and Steelix
10or, used to run it
wherever she went
and Luna, she was my best frie-
wait no she's still here
/me scratches that off
5I remember HL. DD:
HL was..
I own a channel that I am trying to bring back to life
03o.o
I barely remember him
Luna died, obviously
/me shrugs
yeah
I wish Luna was here.
...
Oh?
because most of the regulars left due to their lives becoming busy
I SAID
I wish LUNA was here
ty ^^
or losing interest in Pokemon
:P
5HL; whatever happened to him anyways?
/me hugs Luna
:D
Lunaa :3
just decided to get off TST I guess
/me hugs back
Just like the owners or we
10He left because he lost interest, RP4L
he didnt agree with Motley Crue
5Oh.
CHANGE. NOW ITS TIME FOR CHANGE
Like how I haven't been on much dye to uni
10I chat with him time to time on MSN though
NOTHING STAYS- yeah. you get my point.
/me shot

Onward to the "issue" If you think that the signals are excellent to my modem, then i dont see why you would possibly be testing it, furthermore, if I have full wifi signal, does that mean i would have fast speeds? NO! It really depends on what speed the modem is providing the router. Anyhow, as i see, none of the staff members i have spoken to have actually replied to my comments, all they have done is sent me the same email worded differentl
y, adding more data here and there, so how can i be sure that you arent just generating this crap from a computer? Anyhow, i dont believe that the signal is excellent, otherwise i wouldnt have such terrible speeds, and to be quite honest, your "Speed Boost" advertisement is a sham, as well as before, with a lower internet package I have experienced faster speeds. Is this what rogers believes in? Simply filling their customers with "bonuses" th
at are not true? Also, i have seen that you dont even offer reverse DNS control. Perhaps you can look into that issue, and from what i see, none if your "technical support representatives" know what they are talking about either, it seems as if they are all just reading from a script.
P.S. If you dont look into this issue soon, i will be looking to cancel my service with you, also, if you knew anything, at all, then you would know that PC stands for Personal Computer, and therefore, my Linux computer is a PC, so you should be able to look at my tests from my "PC".
sorry for flood
plus i have both my exes on msn and skype xD
given I am in Hendrix country, Purple Haze

/me goes back to work
I hate my neighbour... WHY IS HE TALKING TO HIMSELF IN THE SHARED BATHROOM SO LOUDLY. >:|
12i'm getting worked up
12over nothing
12how does that hurt
wb
I actually ended up in an argument over the Pokemon anime's year of introduction in Japan
.-.
is it true that it premiered in April 1997 in Japan and that it did not show up in English until a preview in early 1998?
12well...
12you have google
12figure it out yourself :P
he says he does nto believe any Wiki
or any information that exists on the internet
*not
._.
Let me know this guy
I will own him when I get home
anyway bbl
12what is he looking for a newspaper?
maybe
12not very many people would want to publish a book on the history of a kid's cartoon
12i should know when i tried to do a school report on dbz
12and wiki wasn't an allowed source
on person did in relation to Pokemon
12well
12i'm working for your cause
12then again
12if he/she/they are that resistent to the truth
12it's not worth the trouble
You can use the source Wikipedia cited
._.
12if they aren't going to allow any information from the internet to get involved
did you just learn that or something?
12not much you can really do
yes
12nah
I remember the time when I got offended when Crimson Phantom called it that
the person insists on talking to Veronica Taylor
12okay sorry
noooo
I mean
I'm not offended anymore
I used to get offended by that XD
it's fine, seriously
12it's just that everytime i see HoR ever since i first saw it
>freedom of speech
Ah
12i thought of that word and kept to myself
Is that why you don't like us calling it HoR?
12that's why i always refer to this place as "that place"
12XD
12and yes
03LOL
12everytime i see it, my mind goes into the gutter
wat
12Veronica Taylor wouldn't tell the truth anyway
12she is probably drunk on her butt because she lost the best casting position of her life
maybe
but she still shows up at NYAF
12not to mention they probably worked on the dub long before it was actually released to the public
Rachael Lillis too
if I wanted to meet any of the Pokemon VAs it would have to be her
XD
12according to wiki
03XD
well Umbreon, technically you could call it HR
03the shame is that Maddie Blaustein was actually the most willing to work with forums and such, and she died
12the first episode in the US first went on air september 8th 1998
but there was a pilot before that
12but who knows how long they worked on that dub
I like HoR better but yeah, there's THAT word...
I mean, if some random faggot decides to call us that
which aired in the spring of 1998
then it's their problem
they can get lost and become no-life losers
nothing wrong with that
12ahh true
the shame is that Maddie Blaustein was actually the most willing to work with forums and such, and she died <- this
Rachael Lillis does work with fanclubs
if they want to offend someone they can try do it properly WITHOUT the use of silly names
in fact I am a member of one such group
12ahh
12well i threw the idea at you
12because the last 2 people i showed that to thought it was pretty damn funny
it kinda is funny XD
even if it's meant to be offensive
don't get me wrong
I don't like it that much
but on some scale it is quite funny
12hmm
12when you can absorb it as humor
12and not an insult
12comedy can be insulting at times
1290% of the jokes out there is probably your momma jokes
she played Misty, Jessie, Jigglypuff, Pikachu (when Japanese audio was inaccessable), and I think minor characters too
12pokemon should of had guest VAs
12William Shatner would of made a fun character

HILARIOUS!

12darnit

03slightly below my armpit
12below the shoulder?
03yes
03armpits are below the shoulder
Chest pain = you are so fat your heart is breaking down
/me hides
03LOL
12not always
03I'm being serious though >_>
I know
I get chest pains from time to time
12i don't think there are any vital organs thre
12there
03nope LOL
03well
03it's better than a stomacheache
03just that
12except
03it hurts every time I inhale
Heart. Lungs
12i heard of this freak thing
03your heart is on the left
12where this guy had his heard in the left side of his body
03not the right
yes
12*heart
12right side
12sorry
OK, right side
sorry
Maybe it's not the heart
chest wall?
03possible
12could be a muscle ache as well
03yeah that's odd
03if I take my hand and just shove that area that hurts
03it doesn't hurt
03o.o
03like if I put pressure on it
12drf
Anyway bbl in a bit going to close my laptop
12that's how pain usually is for me
03hm,
12if i grab at it like MJ grabs a child
03LOL
12it usually goes away
12at least until i let go
03well yeah
03that's the problem there
03I don't feel like sitting there clutching my chest
12well
03inb4 tournaquet
12i understand if you don't want to take this option
plus its also the universal sign for a cardiac arrest
aka heart attack
12but got any pain killers?
03Tylenol
03but eh
12like i said i understand if you don't want to
03I could always try more Tums, I know that works for heartburn, it mi8ght work for this
12i hate taking medications if i don't have to
12how do you get heartburn below your shoulder?
03because your heart is below your shoulder?
12it'd be like me having a heart attack in my toe
12didn't you say far right side?
/me o.o;
03yeah
03eh
03I could always just try to sleep it of
03*off
03but sigh
03my birthday
03has started off
03crappy
03x.x
12isn't the heart on the left side?
03it is
12i'm sorry if this makes you feel more awful
12but... is it your birthday?
03yes
12happy birthday then :)
03technically I was born at 4PM but yeah
03March 22 is my birthday

12it's called birthday
03XD

on the island of Oahu
03Umbreon I'm just saying
03I happen to know when I was born
12yeah
12same
03I think my mom said it was close to 4pm
12or at least the time i was told
03not sure the EXACT time but LOL
12my friend
the funny thing is I was born on the same island as president Obama
12said that the doctor forgot to check the time he was born
12XDD
12so they second guessed
03LOL
12i have my own problem i want checked on by the doctor
12one of my nose nostrils spews out blood when i blow my nose from time to time
12it doesn't bleed i just blow my nose and there's blood
03ew
there is a funny story about when I was born but I am not sure if I could tell it
12i was worried if it was mixed with the mucus
12but figured that if it was
12blood would also come out the other nostril
12or in the mucus i've been hacking up from the cold
12x-x
12is that sound logic?
ew .-.
/me sighs
03I kinda don't know what to do here
12?
03situation I'm having with a certain person
12care to share?
03I could tell you in private
03It's prolly best not to bring it up in here

MY BLACK CITY IS EMPTY OF ANY ACCESSABLE BUILDINGS
12really?
12i have 3 little houses i can walk into
12a weird big building and a pokecenter
I need to e-mail Nintendo or Pok√©mon.com about this
12i count 10 people

12i beat it in less than 3 days
...
I beat it in 14 days
12oww
Damnit
How now?
12i think drf said that if you don't beat the game in 4 days
12that you lose people in the city
Yes I heard that
I lost interest in a while after the Japan quake
Then drf said that, and I was like PANIC
12:<
rawrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
12i still don't understand the concept of black city
I NEED MY BLACK CITY RESIDENTS

o,o

Can any one sugges a non-crap chat client>
Specifically one that has a UI similar to X-CHat.
AND SSH.
And is NOT the customized mIRC that has been given out on here several times.
!espeon
/me still belongs to Umbreon for 8 more minutes
12!pokemon
Umbreon, you are a 4Smeargle.
Because I have other IRC servers to connect to then this one.
12the way i see it
12either you go mIRC
12or you go to sleep
12XD
CGI
IRC
EVIL IS ME'
/me rages
And is CGI:IRC standalone?
/me is frustrated
I WANT MY BLACK CITY
12it will always have at least 1 person
12you
I dunno, I was joking, it sounds sucky
Plus, I wouldn't recommend anything other than mIRC :P
Now afk
I just need to find a copy of mIRC.
12mirc.com?
Preferably one that I *don't* have to pay for.
Becuase I'm cheap like that.
12mirc is a 30 day trial
12but it's not like the program shuts you out completely once the 30 days expires
Yes.
I'm also a lazy sob.
12i think my mirc client is over 200 days past trial
I prefer to use Y-Chat.
12nope
my mIRC at home on my desktop majorly glitched XD
12349 days
Becuase it's sane, and free.
it says ive used it for 4000 days xD
12and XDD
However... it is not sane on Vista.
(WHich I have a much better name for, but will not repeat due to me not wanting to get kicked. :P )
12you've used mirc for 11 years
12what a loyal customer
12XD
lmfao

12i know some people who bought firefox

03sooooo much black bars
13hey Kosovo
13any white bars?
07what movie is that
O.o
What dvd?
03Crocodile Hunter: collision course
03well
03the movie itself is fine
03but that's the music video
03the Crocodile Rock one
03which is the whole reason I rented the thing XD
Ah, that movie XD
03basically
speeding
03the clips of them singing are "super widescreen", as in 2.35:1
03the movie itself is narrower
>.<
03so instead of being smart about it
03they just put MORE black bars
03>_>
So no stretching :P
03no
03They could have expanded it vertically
03rather than that
03or at least made the music video anamorphic like the main movie...
03anyway, running the DVD through DVD Decrypter
03yay copying rentals and returning them the next day?
Bad XD
03like I really care
13thats what my mom does
03YARR HARR FIDDLE DE DEE
03and such
03yeah, my dad does tha ttoo XD
12I don't see what wrong, as long as you don't try selling the copy
07lol o3o
03yeah
13drf may have inherited it
03like
03EW COMMERCIAL PIRACY
03I'll give away copies but I refuse to take money for them
13Ew
03because that's just a whole nother level of bad
03I've had people offer to pay me for copied movies
03I'm like, no
12lol
Hahah
13you are nice and smart and evil at thge same time drfy
03I'd rather just give stuff out for free :P
03but yeah
03I don't see anything wrong with piracy, it's already been proven to not actually hurt the movie/music industry
03they just need something to whine about
13hey cracky
03but SELLING pirated stuff, on the other hand, is just evil
14hello hello
Yups :P
I just say EW Game pirating cause I'm bored
03LOL
03well
03I buy games that are worth the money
03I preordered Portal 2, twice, in fact
03once for PC and once for Xbox 360
07discussions about your piracy just have to happen all the time don't they =P
03it's not "my" piracy
03I'm just the one who mentions it LOL
13I Lost The Game and by doing so I just Won the Game
03LOL that reminds me
03people are now trolling the Mormons trying to ask if God lost the game
03I'm like LOL
O>O
WHAT
03they got tired of asking how magnets work apparently
Where?
03Mormon.org?
14lol
03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
03just go on art of trolling
03they have plenty of screenshots
12lol, Mormons
03exactly. LOL
07.-.
I have a mormon friend
She is interesting
12Utah was full of them
03I don't have a problem with religion, I just hate people who rub it in everyone's face
03and obviously with a site like mormon.org... LOL
XD Buaha

HAPPY B-DAY
03White Forest is still on the fricking map
most likely not
because Arti is an isolationist
03...
03LOL
meh, true
03"White Forest: A modern city of ongoing development that draws people to it"
12i say we make a new TST group
03that's kinda buggy
Sadly it is :P
Indeed
and cannot accept that groups and forums change over time and that members come and go
drf can run it XD
10I second what bree said
Totaly :3
But I don't/won't get a FB, so I'm not joining
ohai Cass
10Put someone active on facebook in charge of it
12we'll set it as private
12and make cube the leader
Im always on FB XED
Cuuube

you have alot of nicks
:/
04drf
im always on FB but rarely do crap on there i dun like their rubbish games
04it's because of the SAV file
04XD
03except
03that I'm using an actual game
03not a flash card
03;P

Who is gonna make the new TST FB Group o.o
03HML, no
03I have a save dumper
03a little USB thingy
12i doubt we'd be allowed to
yah tru
12if arti saw it she'd probably go on a rampage
So? ;P
she probably doesnt care
12i think she would
I have like
15 here
12ask drf
I use like
2 of them
12he knows her better than any of us

ErmLion?
Or Grasshopper
(Not like OSX matters ;p
No I mean...
OS9 was the last one.
This is OSX
What will the Mac OS with the version number starting with 11 be called?
OS11? OSXI? OSY?
OSX 2?
Or to put it simply: How derp will Apple be.
03!apple
03that says all
Am I really THAT bad of A DJ
:(
I'm pretty sure there are a few Apple users going "What is OSX's version number 10?"
Stormeh!
Ohhoo, what if the variable X was equal to 10 while being the roman numeral 10!
Anakin: /sajoin
Chatdead
What, you want me to do that to you? XD
I don't like using /sajoin
if i'm idle in no channel, yeah
because presea was giving me shit about it

Gaddafi?
when the spambots hit
HELLO, WORLD.
game the system??
a friend of our family's daughter ran off with her boyfriend to do drugs and stuff
he left her
and now what she does is go into the hospital and get free drugs
so could have been that
and a welfare cheque, and free housing
#Powerplant had +R due to defcon
:/ what the hell?
all paid for by the tax payers.
oi
she has her own little apartment, $600 a month in welfare bennifits, and free drugs from the hosptial.
and oh, this network has 2 network names btw .-.
well duuuuh who r thees tax payurs??
yeah
and a TV, internet, furniture in her appartment.
Amber-Novas-IRC-Network and True-Flame-Network
so that might be the problem
Watch the fireworks.

we haven't decided on a normal network name yet...
and get out the popcorn
Is this the Poke SR with a Stick game?

and here I am making barely above $600 working like a slave part time...

Amber-Flame-Network

He has learned to ignore me. Finally.
>long network names
o-o;
Yes ;3
brb, I am in need of emergency 5:00 shadow removal

Im going to report her and try to get her little apartment taken away.
haha
Altair had a nice network name the other day
/me gets physical with LL
it was something like
Welfare basically is what you just described. Except instead of wearing the skin, you just sort of slowly tear it off to keep yourself warm.
The-Awesome-Network-Run-By-Lazy-Opers or something XD
(Activity what powers go)

THE GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR HER DAMN CELLPHONE.
lmfao
Best line ever.

/me oxo
That-Awesome-Network-Ran-By-Lazy-Assholes

Shiny would raaaage though

of course she would never go work or get a job.
yeah
The government even pays for her own personal government.
/me gets physical with Danny <3
that would be paying your own way..
03<3
..ff
Which has its own sect of governments.
/me thinks
I should probably work on that irc muckup thing I wanted to do like 2 years ago
/me ahas
XD
That wasn't the goal. Who are you, anyway?
..That means DRF only has a NickAlert that works with LL
I dunno. I kinda giggled at the randomness of it
he is your master
?
Are you from my forum?
bow before Spyro and worship him as the holder of all things Cheesecake
Keep watching.
When you said something, he instantly replied ;P
XDDDD
Everyone always says they were not trying to be funny or soemthing along those lines when someone points it out.
I haven't laughed harder in a while
hahahahaha

13up and down
/me melts
/me hides
he doesnt have a Kinect...
speaking of which....who are you people
I'd say about 30% of welfare applicants are doing the same thing. Is he pissed about those? No, he has something personal against this girl.
13suuuuuuure
He has another webcam ;P
03LL
make sure you figure out when he will be there, and if it is a scheduled thing, so that you can not tip her off by an ill sloted visit
13bam
13!
03I'll have my Kinect on Saturday
03:)
Im away from any comp
13ooooooooooooooo
But I don't really remember
they're not important
You'll ..touch her using it

..oh the horror]
They should just fuse their bodies together.
13you kids are going to do it on Saturday
03hey
03we aren't kids
Friend of family.
:3
oh friend of the family
yes, but it would be even better if HE was there too
03and I'm now 20 so I'm not even a teenager
Sad
But the animosity he has is unmistakable.
were adults~
03I know
she seriously sits on her laptop and listens to music while browing facebook all day
paid for by the government.
03I missed out on one of the best parts of being a teen :(
13your technically not a grown up yet
well he isn't exactly very skilled at hiding hatred for others
13You can't drink
He's kind of always like this
LOL

He did?
Aww

/me aways
I'm not sensing any sarcasm :P
I know a lot of people who failed it.
Oh well, Wii kinect and move up and down right?
It's not that uncommon.
I failed it my first time
;X
horribly
I almost failed the written part
the driving part was easy
then I just barely passed last summer before going back to school
just...wear protection...girls like that usually have some sort of "infection"
That's right. The greener I am the more attractive I become. I might as well be Kermit the Frog.
Had to pay like $40 for the license because I'm over 18

/me gets back to his rocking chair and old consoles
blarg
I need to find a Job
for real
*sigh*
All I had to do was drive to wal mart, park the car, then drive back
that's really all your test was?
wow
I'm the only person I know who's afraid to get a job and a driver's license, and has no desire to attain either.
yep
damn
that's New Hampshire for you
the written part was a pain in the ass
I'm going to use multiple proxies on our dates, just to be safe.
I was afraid to get a drivers license and a job for a long time
Especially the license
that
that's why I held on to my permit for so long
well don't you feel better now :D
I Need to find a fucking job for real
Not really. xD
lol
*sigh* I'm sick of feeling so worthless
anakin
Altair doesn't know about his dick?
/me runs

I'm getting lucky though. My job applications thus far have been botched by unavoidable circumstances.
Reason pending. :P
Hey!

That's actually a good idea!

I muffin think cucumber is a muffin idea
Exactly

trolls get to roam free

I met this girl
but
She's not my type
So the end
Let's pay WoW and pay $15 a month for it
No thanks
What, she's Ground?
Allods Online is like WoW, but it's actually fun to play
XD
plus its more of a clique community
She's O Negative and you're Just A.
so he would be super effective
*sigh* I have no clue what good Nintendo Soundtracks are out there anymore
Oh, so he might accidentally kill her if they started a relationship.
Have you tried Vortex?
xD
Vortex?
never heard of it
no, he wuld just win all of their battles, therefore giving the relationship an unequal balance of power

I was making sure no one chimed in and got between the two statements. xD
This is Sparta!

No, this is Patrick.

A little :)
Fearfully.

/me nods
Don't kick me! D:

Kick fest!
Now all my channel tabs are in the wrong order
;___;
:(
Okay! So!
just get kicked from all of them in the proper order
/me needs a girlfriend
And
What happened to your other girlfriend?
:o
He ate that one.
You're all going to help me find one by e-mailing me a full list of everyone you know between the ages of somewhere around my age
Yes
Oh, wait, no, she broke up with me
YOU ATE HER?!
D:
Oh
/me points to her parents
THEN you ate her, right?
She broke up with you, so you couldn't let her go.
You just had to consume her flesh.
Oh, no, it was a mutual break up
She just proposed the motion
I seconded it
Her parents influenced her?
The board chair asked for any objection, and seeing no objection, he ruled that the motion carries
She wasn't really the right person for me
And she liked me but her parents didn't want her dating anyone
DUDE
Thunder just made a car alarm go off!
that was crazy
O.O
o_____o
Soooooooo
/me is glad she's not outside
So you ate her.
WE know.
I went on a date with someone else before the dance a little bit later than that
She's a cute too :3
But
She ditched me for someone else at the homecoming dance :(
She doesn't appear to be very delicious.
what a bitch
So *depressed face* :(
Yeah
I feel like being blunt
I'm drinking tonight
M'kay.
I was thinking the whole time "Wow, this girl is beautiful, smart, and we have SOOO much in common! What could possibly be wrong with her?" xD
never ever think that
something is always amist
Well, I didn't think that the whole time :3
/me exaggurated
But I did think that once
She was hotsauce though
fffffffffffffffffbed
And nicesauce, and hadlotsincommonwithhersauce
no wonder
If you addquote, fix my typo.
brb
04brb
And, yeah. Ditched me.
Now they're going out
those are some fine mixes of herbs and spices right there
I think she was tipped off to your cannibalism.
And fled for her life into the arms of another date.
And I had to block her from my Facebook wall after seeing quotes like "That was an amazing night last night... never thought sex could feel so good"
Well, not quotes... just one
Again, another exagguration
ew
Yeah >.<
Painful.
Why would anyone think the whole world wants to hear that?
Reckless intercourse is in vogue.
She got a like from her bf and a lot of friends who were like "haha, finalyl got laid lolzrawr"
brbshower
So
I has hunting hat on again
They actually said lolzrawr?
No, another exagguration :(
:3
Not really. It's older than that.
:3 :3
oh, you mean you're going hunting for girls
ok
Wait, he's a Ballchinian.
Yeah, not for eating though
I thought you meant like how he puts his hat on when he's lonely
haha
I don't think I'm gonna find anyone down here though xD
/me is too different :3
still thinking of moving to Canadaland?
/me nods
I think you should have two separate partners. One for the gradual consumption, and one for actual dating.
/me is really interested in Canabananada
I hate you
Good man.
/me 's eyes grow wide and he waits expectantly.
not at the moment why?
Just curious.... I like keeping track of these things
I'd like to but I can't really do that at this point and time
Because I think she likes you
I know she does
What he means by that is that he's saving the food for later.
You and Glace broke up then?
can't date a JW
Ah
wants me to convert
/me googles
and I aint doing that shit
Oh
She was a JW?
yes
great girl
just too hell bent on the JW crap
ooooh
they think the world is gonna end within the next four years or something
I don't have to work tomorrow
/me grabs some poopcorn
that means I get to party tonight
erm
lucky lucky
/me washes his hands and opts for the popcorn instead
I have to study tonight... some time
throw my hands up. they're plain' mah song. It's a party in the IRC
I get to have a nice little party tomorrow, also known as school.
studying is for wimps
*playin'
Shut up you
XD
:O
I'll fail if I don't
:(
Slapping with trouts like yeah.
XD
hahaha
I'd love to discover the secret of how to move something like "yeah."
/me was yelled at and cries
/me points to the girl who left a message on his facebook profile!
It must be some advanced scientific principle I haven't been taught.
02!pokemon
Ray, you are a 4Teddiursa.

Could yeah be a potential replacement for oil on a global scale? Sounds like it can power anything!
Ray, you are a 11Raichu.
tell her she has a nice ass
02:D?
^ XD
/me yawns
XD
Do girls like that kind of thing?
/me takes RDX's alcohol away and buries it
that depends on the girl lol
/me goes to sleep z_z
just don't call her fat
maybe not
I think they enjoy having their ass be friendly rather than cold.
*to be
Hmmmm
Poliwhirl can learn mudshot
along with earthquake
Tell her she'd be so great with a side of fries.
:3
I think she's flirting with me o.o
I can't tell D:
maybe she's just being nice
The one who said "Nice meeting you today"?
o.o
mebe
I think your reply was very good
yeah
probably doesn't need any further response
/me can't see.
/me can always open FB chat :3
12!pokemon
Umbreon, you are a 10Wurmple.
12noooo
/me wants to figure out of he's attracted to her or not first
What's your protocol for that?
I used a Politoed to turn the tables on an electric type before
lol
/me wonders what the 7 and 6 are doing in there
I've never heard of a rainb7o6w before
Politoed vs Luxray
yes I know you don't really say those things lol
Hmm
the winner of that one might surprise you
02Night everyone~
But I do know....... that I have a monitor kitty on my monitor

Night ray
Monitor kitty is watching me while I type :3

Should we call SETI?
Oh, probably
OH MY GOODNESS
03Happy late birthday lolz

Hmmmm

umm
That sounds like a terrific idea.
Hi

/me floofs on Bree
Go ahead if you want me to say no :P
If it's not awkard in here, I'm not doing my job
xD
Me either.
I was just gonna say
12eeep
I make things awkward in real life situations
Like in my mini-course on Monday
I'd tell that story.... but I want to respect channel decorum :3
/me salutes the channel tapestry
/me looks around and sees no decorum
OH, WHAT A NICE MOTIF
Should I tell the story? :o
7DO EET
Does it involve balloons?
what isn't?
/me checks his rules
XD
It's deifnitely against my code of laws.
Sorry, can't be done.
*definitely
Well
Oay
Okay*
deif-knittly
I didn't get suspended or anything, so, surely I can tell the story :3
So
Haha, yes. He'd come in, call us noobs in orange text, then abruptly leave.
what isn't against the rules
/me chews
don't leave the drunk guy in the dark
ummmm
I think that's exactly where you should be.
he does?
Apparently
/me nods
about?
guurrrlz
:3
oh i luv gurlz
sex drugs and rock and roll
/me asdfs on Sneas for his lateness
I knew a few people in there since English 101, and this was my fourth class with her
So we had a camaraderie already going on
So
03o.o
When we got questions right, or said the correct answer in class duirng the lecture, the instructor would hand out prizes to try to keep us awake and interested
Please tell me you don't eat this one.
XD
:3
Sooooooooooo
man, you ruined the story
now I know what's gonna happen
I got a bouncy ball, and, the lady in front of me who I knew, about 30-40 years old, got a magic wand, and the guy beside her got a bouncy ball
a REAL magic wand?
So there we were, she had her magic wand, the two of us had bouncy balls
Yes, but it ran out of magic
aww
that's no fun
so a tree branch?
wat
spoiler: 1,1you have a small penis that will never satisfy your girlfriend.
o-o
And they were playing around, and he gave her the bouncy ball ... then she made a joke like ".... all I need is another ball and I'll have the whole package"
>+C
So it became an alchemist's tool, then.
uhm
/me hide.
/me smacks with a newspaper
And I said "here, you can borrow mine"
oh wait +C is ctcps i think
/me ponder
i think i'm thinking of c
/me buries his face in a pillow
LOL
You should've rolled with it and acted like you were making a joke.
xD
I didn't mean for it to come out like that xD

well
Did you just make that, or has someone else thought of the same joke?
nah, someone else
they're commenting on how he looks like one
not on how his name is the same as their weapons' names
I like the cute kitty better
I know, but that was the joke I was kinda making.
I hate when people beat me to the punch. xD

I rode a biodiesel-fueled bus the other day
12hmm
It was just an old bus that was probably modified to run on it
its starting to take off as an alternate fuel
I still prefer the CNGs
12one of these days
12we'll have to use soylent green as a fuel
Then again, the CNG buses we have here are newish
Meow
:3

Its your pets birfday

people in the US are doing this
especially those who are environmentally concious

Hmmm
We have Euro 5 buses in here that reduce emissions
By using a chemical called AdBlue
...
!lag
12i'm not a people
12yu however are
One of it's components is urea, supposedly
Which basically is urine oO
wow
in fact diesel engines can run on just about any flammable solution except gasoline
you can run them on vegetable oil, animal fats, kerosene, lamp oil, and other things
plus here is a little known fact
http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk263/A_Grim_Reminder/Gaddafistick.jpg
hi
o3o
the engine's inventor Rudolph Diesel envisioned it to run on peanut oil originally
‚Ä¶ I knew that XD
XD
Lamp oil, rope, bombs, you want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
ohai
lol
Oh
Sorry xD
12does it run on rocks?
for animal fats you have to add a special agent to keep from jelling up the injectors
no
olfkdajfdls I really want to do an MAD with this song or something
I thought my lag was terrible or something
dissolve charcoal in water, make fuel, profit!
o3o
‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶
that's water‚Ä¶
plus ever heard of wood gasification?
yes
or somehow invent liquid charcoal
Liquid charcoal lol
nope, but i can get the basic idea from the name
gasoline engines can run on gasses generated from charing wood in a sealed container
but the problem is the stuff is acidic
/me is nommed
ssssssssssssssssssssss
eventually it can harm some parts of the engine
acids are nomnomnom
omg creepersssssssssssssssssss
brb
hey guys
I have a question
nope
.avi
Argh, I better go to sleep.
Let us say you have a triangle. How do you construct a circle that's tangent to one side and the extensions of the two others?
Nice talking to you people.

OH LOOK A DISTRACTION
sorry got work now
He does eat owls
bbl
'kay bye
and cats
So you never know
this goes back to the alternate fuel thing
I am not sure if these TDI engines can run on vegetable oil but most likely so
wnat a amojito?
No thanks lol

03I'm basically making a list
03with their English names

03thanks to Nintendo
03I lost all but 4
03there should be 10 people
03so I'm trying to put the other 6 back XD
ah
03but in the process I'm helping my friend out
03as he only has a list of the English names
03as in, which Pok√©mon they're responsible for bringing in/out of hte forest
03so I'm just doing JP -> English

o3o
Satoko
03k
‚Ä¶ lol that's Ashley's JP name
:'D
03how do you translate from Japanese symbols to letters
/me remembers Ashley
03I don't want to say Kanji as I think that's wrong
03is it katakana?
lol
yeah, in this case it's katakana
03OK
03yeah I confuse them XD
the curlier ones are hiragana
like "„Å™„Åó"
03isn't there a furigana too?
in katakana would be "„Éä„Ç∑"
furigana is the tiny letters written on the sides/top of kanji (depending on the orientation)
okurigana is the hiragana/katakana that comes after the kanji
03LOL THAT CHARACTER
03it looks like a fricking face
‚Ä¶
XD
I NEVER noticed that
lolz
03I keep referring to that as the "Japanese smiley face"
03what IS that anyawy

03as I can't figure this out x.x
/me waits for loading again
03wait
which two buttons?
03I think the right of the two means "none"
‚Ä¶
03and the left is something else
03on the bottom
03there are two buttons
03the two light grey ones
03wait
03darn it
03OK you see that list of 9 names on the right?
03there are 3 columns

03the first 9 have one symbol
03the 10th has another
yeah
03what are those two symbols

I just need something that can recognize characters
"The Sheep"
/me finds that funny
03LOL
but that's not what we're looking fore
03yeah I think its something like the first one is "yes" and the second is "no"?
(that's the Zodiac lol)
"never" "still" "not yet"
wonderful, banlist increased to like, 900
03hm
"up until now"
anyway bbl
03<bluesun> btw the buttons are Edit.Add.Remove <- so that's the 3 buttons
03hm
other one is "finish [off], get done with"
I think it means like
‚Ä¶
OH
the top of the column says "speak"
so it's like
SON
I am disappoint.
"spoken to:" Êú™ (already done) Ê∏à (not yet)
does that make sense?

hm
my dnsbl is so damn effective when it comes to ban evaders lol
03god I wish I had the ability to properly dump DSi ROMs x.x
not as effective with botnets
as they put too much strain on it
was more but some expired
was around 800-900
and then i accidentally /os szline list
and SCREEN FLOOD HURRRRRR
-.-
03LOL
03szline?
yes
03what's it do
it's basically like akill
except gzlines instead of glines
03the real question is
03why are you banning so many people
botnet attack
I didn't ban, the dnsbl did
I use /gzline not /os szline add lmfao
too much typing
you're lucky there haven't been any attacks here
because I don't think there's a bopm/dnsbl set up lol
brb dinner
03o.o

basically, it's like, something that searches a blacklist for IPs when someone connects
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/funny-facebook-fails-deaf-win.jpg
and if the IP is in the blacklist then it bans it
03eh bans
03more trouble than they're worth
03you get one that one genuine good person who tries to connect but you think he's a botnet
03and etc etc
drf lol, when you get 300 user botnet attacks
03I'd be like
03COME AT ME BRO
that flood your channel

Altair was like that

I was finally able to extract it using the unarchiver on mac, because * is legal on mac filesystems
03or, you just rename it
03I know it's rocket science
I can't. it's in an archive.
03give me a link to the archive

03you also could have used Linux you know :P
03Mac filesystem isn't any different than Linux filesystem
Mac OS uses a totally different file system than Linux
I could have started up my xubuntu VM on my mac, but that'd be jumping through hoops.
Mac OS X uses HFS
03no, I know it uses HFS
03I mean the actual naming scheme
03both are based on UNIX.
oh
03hence why the terminal is the same
03well, the commands rather
orer, POSIX
not if you consider the kernel but I am splitting hairs
03o.o
Mac OS X uses the Mach kernel which is somewhat related to BSD UNIX
mach-O , iirc
I am not totally sure about the exact name but I do know its Mach
taken from NeXT Step and Openstep
03wow
03that totally killed Windows Exploer
03*Explorer
what did
03trying to extract that 7z
weird
well I am having fun here

03Um, no?

there are also some illegal folder names, such as prn and com1
interesting that HFS would block those things
nah, its only illegal on windows

and i was like, Y I CAN"T DO DIS! DO I HAVE VIRUS?
no i don't, but its one of those windows things. and if you do manage to name a folder called prn or com1, say, a mac over the network, bad things will happen.

03I sent FMA a router and he bricked it
and I thought he was a tech person
03he is
how did that happen
03no idea
how did you debrick it
03I didn't
03he still has it
let me guess
DD-WRT firmware
03yeah
03I wanted him to make it run faster for me
just like my WRT54G v8
03he went to flash it and bricked it
03this was a WRT150N
03the one HE recommended to me
04o-o
this is why i don't so dis.
risk or brock.
04;:|
*of brick
04:|
I hacked mine
its quite happy with the custom firmware
plus the features are incredible
wut features?
lik,e hosting ur own servar?
03virtual access points for one
03you can have as many as you want on one router
04some weird tech talk
Wake On LAN, bandwidth management, access point features, revenue generating ads
/me listens
04or reads
04w/e
03LOL
ads, reveneue. really?>
I can't list everything in DD-WRT
yes
if you are a business using a router with the firmware
the bandwidth monitoring features might be useful for you Jun
to let you know when you are approaching your monthly cap
i just login to my ISP's page
ok
DD-WRT lets you do that from the router firmware
you just have to be using a modern web browser with the Adobe SVG plugin
i herd SVG was gettin ditched or something
I have no idea
but most browsers should have it
you can also do things like increase the transmit power for WIFI
I boosted it a little bit
in fact given this I recommend the WRT54G
for a couple reasons
1. they are cheap plus 802.11g is fine for most people
and 2. most versions can run DD-WRT and some up to version 5 can run Tomato
the WRT54GL I also recommend
DRAKE
/me pokes
have you read Reminiscence?

04I read some of it
go read the rest then
I spent 6 months writing it >:B
lol WRT54
WRTs are decent
sometimes
i have a wired modem from D_LINK
the official VXWorks firmware is crap though
the two I mentioned are pretty much identical except for one thing
the WRT54GL uses Linux based firmware
as does the WRT54G up to version 5
12that's not a damaging attack D:
o_o
wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
12what?
XD
Dlink lol
vxworks RTOS, ae?
they're okay
12interesting
better than speedstream -_-
it sucks to say the least
speedstream routers
12it's a natural comedian
mfw
in fact I am starting to see VXWorks as an oxymoron now
and ATT routers
12pff
AWW HELL NAW
also kinda afk going to be like
configuring bind9
and failing
<%Umbreon> it's a natural comedian <-- so is the voice recognition on Android phones
some of the mistakes I have seen one make are HILARIOUS
one of the best was mistaking "his track meet" for "histerectomy"
owel --> Peel (that wan i encountered myself)
wat
!define histerectomy

03well that's odd
03the DOS emulator for normal flash cards works with the sound on KEEN4.EXE
03but yet, the DSTWO specific one that utilizes moar CPU doesn't do sound o.o;;;
oh, there's also a kernel panic, and iirc, a BSOD screensaver for mac, too
nice
the BSoD screensaver would make more sense on a PC though
wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

crappy video card driver for a Chips and Technologies 65555
the Linksys router video I linked before is from someone who is a big fan of Technics audio equipment
I can understand even though I mostly have experience with Yamaha
honestly Natural Sound is really all I have ever known
I really like the sound quality coming out of the two Yamaha amps even though some audiophiles say that it has no character
/me ponders what Drake is doing
the way I see it the sound is uncolored and very true to the original source
;o

04I was having a shower
ohai
12oh
/me furs up the clean Drake

04It took me ages to wash myself. I don't need any fur on me.
12don't worry you can just rub the fur off
04A bit hard when you're still wet.
Heya Roland

[19:51:22] -HostServ- vHost for Roland has been activated
Nice
04Without any priot experience in RPG maker.
if you need any help with it
04prior*
such as learning how to crash the program
04XD
I'll be willing to do it for you
:3
and no problems Roland
although Drake
04We could actually use some help with programming if none of us are able to understand it.
My friend Cyradis is really good at RPG maker
04Although Ben or I should be able to use it.
04really?
Cyradis/greenelephants
yeah
she's made like
pretty damn awesome games with it
I'll talk to her
12http://damnyouautocorrect.com/images/frost-tips.jpg
04Wait until I ask NS
04I'd rather see if we can do it first.
04I'll ask Ben if he can make the scenery and backgrounds in Blender as well.
lmfao Umbreon
04He's pretty good at making models, so I figured it wouldn't be too hard to make a background.
04LOL
well Drake
you do your image shi
t
I'll work with Cyradis on the actual game if you want
04XD
04Alright
04I'll ask if needed.
she's not online atm
I'll see her tomorrow anyway
03anyway
03off to bed
04k
XD
04I was just thinking that it'd be pretty hard to communicate with the other guys about this.
email?
IRC?
drag them on here
04I'll mention it to Dylan tomorrow, as he's really the only one who knows about it right now...
04XD

considering you and your intelligence
>:D
/me hides

i have had my fair share of freezes on both tho
04Especially with History.
04XD
or "I WANT TO KISS YOU ALL THE WAY DOWN TO YOUR BALLS"
something like that
04Because you'd find that interesting.

04Kenyon's not evil.
04But he's damn pessimistic.
also
Student: Okay, so we dismember the bomb...
Mr Henshaw: Disarm, not dismember. You dismembered him.
Student: Okay, shush! It's not my fault you have a stupid scenario!
04Which is why we get along well.
04LOL
XD
Duty Girl: Have you marked the roll?
Mr Henshaw: ...
Mr Henshaw: I *am* the roll police!
Mr Henshaw: ...go away.
*duty girl leaves*
Student: She was only doing her job!
04LOL
04haha

Student: Crap!
Teacher: Toilet's downstairs.
I just heard a snap from where my communications receiver is
XD
04XD
must be the bleeder resistors removing a static charge from the massive wire antenna again
Teacher: Open your laps! I mean, open your tops! Uh...I mean, open your laptops!
my school magazine
has the most epic quotes ever sometimes
*student stabs another student with a fork*
Student: Ow! She forked me!
Teacher: That's not forking funny.
ohgod the lameness of that
and Drake
04LOL
(class is talking about organisms)
Student: Mr Donald, what's an orgasm?
lmfao
04XD
Teacher (chinese guy): Oh no, I got the sex wrong.
XD
Teacher: Oh my god. It's not testicles. It's the jewels in the Queen's crown! So that means it's rare...not that balls are rare or anything.
XD
@ Drake
oh and
04my god
04what is wrong with your school?
Teacher: Naturally, boy attract to girl, like negative charge and positive charge. So, boy try to kiss girl.
hey
my school is awesome
don't diss it Drake xD
and that quote there is hilarious
04XD
oh

Teacher: What's the fastest thing in this room?
Students: What?
Teacher: My pen, it just ran out!
/me facepalms

Student: Are you serious?
Mr Parker: No, I'm Mr Parker.

Teacher: You guys, you are clever, but you suck at multiple choice. You suck like never before.
Please tell me you took that as wrongly as I did, Drake XD
wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
04o-o
XD
Student: Mr Parker, you're so lame.
Mr Parker: LAME is an anagram of MALE.
Mr Parker is the king of lame jokes, Drake, even I can't beat him at that ._.
and DON'T DEBATE THAT
XD
04wat
oh yeah
Drake, you know how teachers usually say stop playing games?
Mr Parker: Everyone, stop doing work, get on your computers and PLAY GAMES!

I have actually used perhaps the most underrated water Pokemon ever
Politoed
....XD
well think of it this way
Politoed can cover for its weaknesses very effectively
and can learn some interesting attacks
mine WON against a very powerful Luxray
one shotted it with earthquake
i know, it's a very interesting but sometimes weaker pkmn
12Hello J Lugia :3
heya
Poliwrath can't learn many of the attacks that Politoed can which cover for its weakneses
Poliwrath is weak against grass, electric, and psychic attacks
where as Politoed is weak just against grass and electric
but can cover for said weaknesses

03<Skylands> [15:56] <Skylands> I found some of the Johto Journey Collector's Edition DVD at the library, but the discs themselves are in horrible condition <- were you just looking to copy them?

12with fur
12hi
03don't worry about playing them
/me watches
03as long as the computer can read them
10Oh?
03all you need is DVD Decrypter
03yeah
03computer DVD drives tend to be more um
03able to read discs
03than DVD players
10If you say so
10k
03http://mrbass.org/dvdrip/SetupDVDDecrypter_3.5.4.0.exe
10Only one of the four DVDs are in perfect condition, it almost looks brand new
03basically
03what you want to do is
03set DVD Decrypter to Mode -> ISO -> Read
03then just write the disc to an .iso file
03if it completes with no read errors
03then you can burn it using whatever
10I have a program to copying DVDs already
03which program?
10Dunno, waiting for my dad to get home
10It's on his desktop
03LOL
03well
03just use DVD Decrypter, trust me
03it's the only real way to get exact copies XD
10Do I click DVD Burning or Ripping?
03ripping
03http://i.afterdawn.com/articles/DVDDec01_02valitseISO.jpg
03that's what you want
10Can't find the file
03wait what
10for the Destination widget
03just put it on your desktop or something
03it lets you pick where you want it to go
hey
/me doesn't speak computer language
12lol
10Do I go to My Computer?
03want to just run TeamViewer and let me show you how to do it?

6Anyone have a Vullaby (or something like that) I can trade for a Rufflet on B/W? Ovo
Inside you'll find the transformer and the x-ray tube. Save the x-ray tube because they typically go for about $50 on ebay. If you like you could save it for future experiments, maybe make a nightlight out of it. Hell you could throw it at somebody if you feel like it, that choice is up to you.
03I don't know what either of those are.

10Ah
Skyday!
ohai Skylands
flustered and bored
you?
13hey Sky
10Mine used to be AngelicLugia when I first joined, but I changed it because Lugia is no longer a favourite
12Lugia, Great plus a number was too much XD
Tired
I got 4 or 5 hours of sleep last night and it's really hot where I work
D: at least it's warm now??
I might just shorten my nick to Hyper ;p
13NO
13its fine the way it is
It actually snowed again last night
XD
...
D:
RIGHT after it all melted
it's warm and sunny here
aw, lucky
12Also, Lugia is still in my favorites, but he‚Äôs not really my ‚Äútop‚Äù favorite anymore
that's Minnesota for you though
13OOO
You can never predict what the weather's going to be
12So yeah, just too many reasons
13T_T
12Lugia is number 3 to me
12Zorua, Latios, Lugia
uh oh
it was pretty funny
what happened
12followed by, Axew Espeon and Umbreon
he just kept making stupid comments about everything SR said
finally SR got sick of it and said something like
"Nothing you've said so far has been remotely funny or informative"
12Mew is my favorite 1st gen Pokemon :3
I just noticed TST is back up
its a toss up for me

13LOL you look for free name
13jk
hi
12Oh, lol
7hey
7I'm bored, the forums I frequent are down. I'm grasping at straws for entertainment
7you like adoptables/pet sites?
12I remember when I first joined I tried to enter Lugia as my name not thinking it was taken XDD
D:
depends on what they are, but generally
7coolio. I have some invites for Gryffs and I think it counts as a petsite because each one has a degree of individuality
/me likes old-school Disney movies :3

he needs to get with the program
he tried to talk to me a while back
7I look back on him with a sense of nostalgia
agreed
13Should've given yourself an Espeon name
13Lugiapower
13hows that?
13:B
7we need to turn this place into new SC
13hey ANgy
is he still trying to get unbanned from SF?
13Yo~
12Never enough Espeon ~
13:3
the saddest part is that he still wants to come back after what...3 years
13SHINY!
02hi
7god who even cares any more? SF is taking its last sputtering breaths as the life support machine loses power
and yeah, we should
indeed
06Hi Shiny :3
02hi
7I'm not sure what exactly the life support machine is in that metaphor
7I'm leaning towards SR but if that's the case then the power cut was a while ago
it was LoS but even now they're not doing that anyways
oh
the number of active members maybe?
04hi drf
13hey drfy
10I hate the stuff we ate
AE, pm?
12lol, what was it
10Chicken stirfry
12XD
13My package hasn't arrived yet
12I'm having rice and egg rules for dinner
13I'm am so looking foward to the Electronic Lugia
13but I wonder if its going to ever get here
12Do they make good Chicken?

6Yeah, an outbreak of Tyrannitar. XD
03I'm about to get my White Forest fixed. :D
7aah
6o.o
03EW POK√âMON TURNING INTO ANIMAL CROSSING
I wonder what the other 10% is.
13well idk
03basically, for every day you don't talk to the people in White Forest/Black City, they have a better chance of leaving
10Whut
03INCLUDING WHEN YOU START THE GAME
It skipped 311
03so in other words
03if you don't beat the game in 4 days or less
Wth.
03goodbye to some people
03x.x
13it was only $50.00 something
6D:
6WAT.
03and those people take with them the ability to catch old Pok√©mon
Only 4 days .c.
03now, luckily I have a save editor ;P
Evil
it skipped 311 because amber wasn't the color of your energy *bah dum chhhh*
still afk
just had to do something for a sec
13ebay
10$50 /is/ expensive
10for something such as that
he may have lost confidence
You missed the annoy SR game
12Okay, back
7aww
7why didn't I get an email or something?
13I got a reciept
13so I can get my money back
10Good thing you did
13but its been 3 weeks now
7explain?
10One of the forum-goers bought one on eBay not too long ago, and they never received it in the mail, and had no receipt, so yeh
7why?
10They were out of luck
7well
7I understand in general
7that's just how he talks
13I just hope it wasn't sent to the wrong address or stolen in the mail
~dns 89.36.225.3
/me sit
wait no

Resolved 89.36.225.3 to: ns1.EforieNett.ro
ic
12Knowing eBay, the seller just kept it
Lolz Rebecca Black. Someone told me that song sounds better slowed down 6 times. XD
13brb
it actually does
13back
Well yeah, but he was only doing it to SR
7how pissed did SR get?
You should've seen before when he pretended to be sad because SR didn't PM him
04drf
04that's why
04you get White version
04do NOTHING
04for a week
04and then get the C-Gerar
04*gear
03but you'd also need someone else
I couldn't really tell
But he was already mad
13but the person I bought it from sells lots of other pokemon stuff
04connect
03who has a game
03who ALSO diddn't do anything for a week
04to your Black version
03whatever
7why?
03I'd much rather
04:3
03just edit them back in
03:P
04Not possible yet
03as bluesun is a pro like that
I would too
03yes it is
04well
03it's totally possible
03he's doing it right now
03:P
04in english
04:V
03...
03dude
03the saves are interchangable
He was ranting about some lazy person who lived on welfare or something
03last night I was playing around with it
04I mean
04the program to do it
03I changed who was in my forest and they were there in English
04is in japanese
03yeah
because I don't know anyone else in my area keeping up with Pokemon games
03it's not that hard to use actually
04and the translation is broken
03you just need to know the names
04beyond repair ;-;
04eah I don't
03you just load the save and click the bottom button
03well
plus buying another DS Lite and a copy of the opposite version is kind of expensive
03that's why you ask bluesun :P
04I messed around with entree forest lol
"THE GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR HER DAMN CELL PHONE."
7SR was taking the moral highground on laziness?
04k
04I'll ask him to remove everybody from White Forest
It's a sex addiction epidemic
04then make another save with everyone there
04|D
03why...
04un
04um
03why not just have him edit your save so everyone;'s there
04Black City
7oh please. he should see the british welfare system
03why would you want to remove them all
04duh
03oh
03well
03it doesn't work that way
he's not really lazy :P
03the people you want to show up on the C-Gear
03are in the "back garden"
03not 'gone'
03when they leave the city they go to this back garden thingy
just with stuff he doesn't care about
03that's why he was able to fix it
...like SF
03because it showed who left
04black garden...?
03so he's just putting them back
03:P
03Back
03not black
04Back garden?
03there's no real name for it, that's just the name the save editor uses
04huh?
03yeah
03picture it as this
03if I'm at your house
03and I want to leave your house
03I'd go out the back door
03into a ... back garden
04ah
/me hides
03again, the name is just what the save editor ues
03there's no actual yerm for it
03*term
04hm
03but yeah, if you just delete all the people, it won't work
03you need to have 10 people in the back garden
04fine
6I just got to White Forest. :)
04I'll tell him to put everyone in the back garden
/me runs
13SL!
03how many people are there
qut
*wut
03and I mean, people with names
03like when you talk to them
03it'll be like Name: Blah blah
03if they don't have a name it doesn't count
03I only had four people when I got there, out of 10 x.x
FAIL
but on Black or White's part
6 2 so far.
6Exploring.
03> bluesun, I made a brand new save
03> and there are 10 people in the garden, as well as 3 people in the back garden.
03<bluesun> k
03> apparently it just takes 3 people at random
03> and puts them there
7hey, anyone here played DA2?
cool
so you CAN cheat the White Forest/Black City BS
03yes
03but
03you either need to be using a flash card or have a $30 Chinese save dumper XD
no problem
03because you'd have to get a .sav file from the actual game card
03I can do it myself, but yeah
6I count 5.
03OK
03also wow
03I had horrible luck this time
03on my random new game
03all but 2 people had a base happiness of 30
no
03it's usually 5 that are 30 and 5 that are 70
03base happiness of 30 = they're gone after 4 days
7don't. Bioware are dirty bastards
03base happiness of 70 = 8 days I think?
why?
7none of the plot questions from the first game are answered and a hundred and forty seven million new ones are raised
04hi Angel
04again o.o
12Ji
13router randomly turned off
13=w=
12*Hi
7I wish to smack them repeatedly
03actually nvm
03base happiness of 30 = they leave after 6 days
maybe they're making a third one?
03base happiness of 70 = they leave after 16 days
7they are
7but it's the way they do it that grates
03<bluesun> there's 20,30,70,80
03<bluesun> aka 4,6,14,16
7Bioware smack you with interesting questions and then run away singing peter pan songs
7honestly
7don't tell me of worldwide rebellion, throw in a Leliana cameo and then roll the credits
7it's Witch Hunt all over again
perhaps
I would have to do a lot of hacking and cheating to make it playable
03Doing that it's also possible to edit first-gen Pok√©mon into your save
03Not really
03all I did was give myself a team of 6 first-gens and beat the game with thej
03*them
10My dad fails
7You are in a forest. You are likely to be eaten by a grue. Suddenly, this comes running at you: http://www.wacabas.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bear-riding-horse.jpg
10He thought I meant the program for burning music CDs
03LOL
/me facedesks
10gtg
03:<
hacking Black or White should not be too bad
04:<
04bye Feathy...
04hacking it how?
04Level geometry? Scripts? :V
03I think he just wants to do what I did
03and put a team of non crappy Pok√©mon in there
yes
that and bypass the stupid White Forest and Black City timer
03I like White better anyway XD, better music etc
03but yeah
03all you would need to do
I still want to sweep her with a Staryu or Starmie
03is after you start the game, within 4 days, dump your save
03then just play the game as you wish
04one hit all the time
03mine do the same
03to 5th gen
03anyway
04and I'm like
04LOWER LEVEL
03then you would just take your dumped save and edit the White Forest stuff
04by 10 or so
03it's all about type advantages ZXD
03-Z
04actually
04Zweilous keeps pwning people with crunch
04and Chandelure with shadow ball
04regardless of types |D
03my Haunter does that same thing
03but
03it has low defense
o_o
03so I just gotta out-speed themXD
10o.o
04Yeah :P
heya
10hi
04Mine aren't the speediest
04But dang Serperior is freaking fast
04He's suppose to be
03I've got Flash officially as my phone has 2.2
03exactly LOL
mine is the real deal too
03I know
04but
04he's still cool
03I think when I start Black
heya Skylands
04Stone evos are usually boss
04:E
03I'll get a team of 3 starters
Hm
03which generation has the best water type
Shiny is online
ohai NS
03that isn't 5th
10Shiny's on TST's server
04Right because there's more than one 5th gen water type
04:P
Shiny is on here too
hes on here too
not joined to any channels
03I said STARTER
04starter
03wait no I didn't
03I mean starter
i was about to say that xD
10lolwhy
04forgot to add that
03which generatiuon has the best water type starter
second
04It depends
Totodile
04lol
03hm
03I kinda like Blastoise myself but eh
04Alligators ftw yeah
Feraligatr is pretty cool though
04drf
04are you looking for stats or appearence
04:P
03which one is stronger?
03stats LOL
04k
03I mean
04lemme check
03I definitely want Charizard
03as fire/flying is pro
03and I just have an attachment to Chikorita XD
03and Bayleef/Meganium whatever
03Meganium can learn Leaf Blade, can'tit?
04I think
03k
04But um
03though I dunno
04I dunno if its attack is the best
03is Sceptile stronger than Meganium?
04lol 82
04lemme check
03and I suppose I can go with Totodile for my water type
04Meganium's attack is 82
03well
04but its defense is
03seeing as how most grass attacks are SPECIAL ATTACK
04100
03I don't see why that matters
04um
04Leaf Blade?
03k
03nvm
0485
04for Sceptile
03so in other words only barely better
04but 105 special attack
03what's Meganium's special attack
0484 XD
03o_o
03what's Sceptile's defense?
04erm no, 83 I think
0465
03ew
03so it's stronger but weaker
03I like tanking grass types LOL
04Sceptile's more speed and attack apparently
03just because they seem to be the weakest type
04120 speed
03it's like LOL FIRE BLAST
03what's Meganium's speedd?
03-d
04LOL Sceptile's actually faster than serperior
04um
04slow
04very
04slow
0480
03so you'd suggest going with Treecko over Chikorita?
04Hm
04It kinda depends
03well
04I mean, its faster
04and has higher attack
03my others will be Charizard and Feraligatr
03so yeah
04So if you can tank its attacks with ones that'll knock out virtually anything that can kill it
04and give it lovely stab
04you'll be good
04with Sceptile that is
03heh
03well'
03I <3 Chikorita, but at the same time, Sceptile is really awesome
04btw, aside from your 5th gen hate, DO NOT GET EMBOAR FOR GODS SAKE
03it's hard to decide :/
04I mean
04its stats
04its highest is its HP
Stats
04but everything else could be better
lol
04x-x
04yes, the turning point of battles
04lol
04:P
seriously 5th gen sucks
04nah it has some tanks
and my level 9001 pikachu can beat that crap
:B
04yes because it can take out a ground type
04OH WAIT
/me flees
Surf
Solarbeam
trollface.jpg
04um
wait not solarbeam
04It can't learn sol-
04eyah
03LOL
04and Surf is an event
04plus
VOLT TACKLE
04Who says the opponent has to be ground type
FLY
SURF
04...
04Fly is crap to ground types
THUNDER
RAIN DANCE
HURRRRRRR
04Volt tackle and thunder do NOTHING
I know
but well
/me runs
my weavile is pr0
you mean Pikachu != Mew
04so is my Chandelure which is fire type
/me runs
Weavile + Lucario + Alakazam
Chandelure is also ghost
Night Slash
04frack LOL
04I ALWAYS forget that
04still
And my weavile has 383 speed at level 100 :V
04:P
04and um
04waitasec
04...
04:E
pokemon online
/me hides
383 would also require 31 IVs in speed
04I know
and why the hell am I talking about pokemon
04um
/me idles again
04there's nothing wrong with it?
06Whoa
04Why the hell are you here if it's that much of a sin to you :E
06Because of me
06\o/
because of my friends lol
and the occasionally interesting talk
-ly
04fair enough :P
04though
04your friends also exist on your site
06!pokemon6s
06=P
04you silly
04there be no S there :3
well
there's no drf there
and drf on HoSHiNET is boring
now two successful Adobe Flash installs on Android 2.2 tablets
drf is more fun here
/me hides
06But I cut it in a proper way.
06!pokemon again for good measure
Espeon, you are a 9Lombre.
!pokemon
06Lol Mexicomon
06also light green
aye carumba
04drf is fun here because nobody gives him the evil eye when he's being a tard :3
/me hides
03LOL
/me uses mean look
/me can't escape!
/me uses Fissure
06:3
06Those moves miss far more often than the accuracy actually implies
Well pokemon do have a habit of blinking
04lul
trollface.jpg
;o
/me sits on Shiny.
06.
06~
!pokemon
;3
10whenever I see the word 'polish', I think of it in the sense of making something smooth/shiny
02Hmm?
06Lol.
hm
wb n2
/me stares at Shiny
02Hai
06Snugglesiiiiiilk
06Oh no not the ponies
/me accepts the pony
14Hey everyone
oh I need to talk to you Shiny
03frtuy;uy
02Kk NS
/me snuggles snugglesilk~
ohai Sneas :3
06Hi
!fight Espeon
/me uses Fire Spin on Espeon! It's not very effective... Espeon loses 50 HP! Espeon has 913 HP left!
!fight Espeon
/me uses Last Resort on Espeon! It's a critical hit! Espeon loses 187 HP! Espeon has 726 HP left!
k
03Last Resort what
03wtf does that do
13It's a powerful attack that can only be used when all the other moves in the moveset have been used at least once in the battle
06Isn't that that move you can't use if all PP is u
06...
06;-;
03define powerful
06140 base
03oh wow
03no recoil?
13Nope
03nice
03is that a 5th gen move?> as I haven't heard of it before
13Though tbh the very few times I've used the move, it hardly seemed to do anything at all xD
14I don't think so
06No recoil, 5 PP itself though
134th gen
06Oh well ·Éö(‚óî‚ó°‚óî ·Éö)
14yep
14o.o
02I'm suddenly reminded of Simon's Cat
03yay, maxed out everyone on my White Forest
heya Multi
Heya Multi ;3
lol last resort
hey hml....
:3...
:...
:>...
last resort is useless
normal type attack
takes too long to use
:o
O:
06It's an amusing idea though.
I'd rather use that 120 base recoil move
double edge
Am I..going to get... nah~
/me feeds snugglesilk
14I found out I was allergic to cats today...
7On another note, I'm really tempted to sneak a pokemon reference in my English essay. >>
o_o'
o-o
06Valuable information.
7So...
7That quote.
4thought you would want to know
/me 7wobbles her paw horizontally.
7Or should I say, along the horizontal axis.
/me 4is baffled by quan's use of mathmatical terms
4geometric*
13Circumference.
13Equation.
13Do I win?

7We talked about shiny pokemon in general.
Blarg blarg blarg "nhcaavra".

02I was just wondering

4WHY WOULD ANYONE BE MAD/!
Blarg blarg blarg "rniodno".

02I don't know.
[20:38] * Disconnected < Timing
And I was going to say that line right after you said yours
02I went to go eat, then had to deal with my parents' fighting, now I come back and just ask a simple question.

Blarg blarg blarg "kicuhap".
Pikachu
You need the full stop. :P
Blarg blarg blarg "magikrap".
02I have these nickalerts in the first place because I easily forget about the chat, so it's an easy way for people to get my notice. And frankly, a lot of people call me Shiny, so hence why I have shiny as a nick alert.
03LOL NICKALERTS
/me does not use them
WIn :D
02I know
02Because you are so addicted to the chat
/me shall never use them XD
7Eh, I think I should set up Quan or something as one. :P
03they just cause more harm than good
02Which I'm not, but when friends come on, I still want to see them
03same with /ignore
7'cause when're you ever gonna use that otherwise? o.o
03quantum physics?
03I dunno :P
03or quantity
7Quan as a sole word, though?
03nickalerts don't work that way
02They just have to be within the word
GTFO MY CONNECTION
!pokemon
WB XD
!pokemon
!pokemon
!pokemon
D:
!pokemon
LOL
theeeere we go
Qwilfish
02And again to drf, you're on all the time unless you have to be somewhere, but then you're just leaving the computer on and you're still on the chat, so yeah nickalerts can probably be annoying
02But seriously, all I asked was if someone called for me. I wasn't mad, I wasn't annoyed, so why did you just suggest that I change the nickalert?
03I wasn't the one who asked
!calc 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 * 10
02I know you weren't, I was pointing that last one at Quan
Lol, he has 2 calc scripts.
hurr
7Meep?
7Because it pops up occasionally when we mention shiny stuff not about you?
02So? I don't mind
02I was just asking if someone was wanting me when I was away for 30 minutes
03woah
03apparently Woot is an Amazon affiliate
03didn't know that
Is that a good thing?
02If it surprised drf
02Yes
03LOL
plus Amazon has an app store for Android now
I got the announcement earlier on this week
Intruder alert!
/me hits alarm button with frantic force.
who was that
o___o
He's from the #epic-chat channel.
03yeah
03but
He's cool, I was just being stupid.
03I heard it used some nasty DRM
/me twiddles his thumbs anxiously
D;
04FFFFFFFFFFFF LIGHTING
04HOW DOES IT WORK
04;_;
03the same way magnets do

04http://www.pokemonelite2000.com/11816/why-is-there-no-pokemon-mmo
04WE NEED THIS ;A;
02Oh gosh yes
02And it needs to be in Colosseum graphics
For the 3DS ;3
Streetpass too
02I don't think 3DS could handle an MMO
02a*
04it could
04if it you know
04ALLOWED ACTUAL DLC ;=;
04And patches
04and didn't have a crappy wi-fi chip
04or whatever it is they use for connecting online >.>
The 3DS chip is improved lol
04I'd like to see that for myself :P
They have IR ports now too :P
04oh goody no more hardware tethering :P
03the 3DS is still a major disappointment
03that said I want to get one
03I might get one on launch
03but the specs aren't anything impressive
:O
>nintendo uses impressive specs
That will happen when they realise they're doing it wrong.
Or basically, when they get out of business.
04i.e. never
Aka, when the world ends.

:P
Amy's theme is worse
blegh, bored out of my fricken mind. I am out of beer(not including that nasty Guinness), out of fresh and exciting games to play, and pretty much out of uninterrupted "me" time
*innuendo alert*
Hyper, outta curiousity do you even tune in to SSS anymore
and EWWW
Erm, nope
:/
I don't even listen to any of my streams anymore x.x
well, youre only proving my theory even more right
other than that...I have been fantastic :D
:O play a new game
lol
beer is gross anyway silly
What theory
That people seem to care less and less about my show
Or maybe people are caring less and less about IRC
night all
eh, I find most beer drinkable. As for the games...I can never seem to hold onto enough self allotted funds to buy a new game. and no, I don't spend it all on beer

:/ I do have a couple of bottles of liquor running around here somewhere. Rum and Vodka
Maybe i should just quit
As you can see, everyone else is lowering too :|
So it's not all your problem
Fri 18th Feb '11 - Chip Out: 75
Sat 19th Feb '11 - Silver's Saturday Show: 48
Sun 20th Feb '11 - L!VE Nintendo: 76 - Half Year Special
no one has ever had it below 60 before
And if you quit, you'll be the first person to get 0 :(
well, i keep asking myself every saturday, "is this really worth it if no one really honestly cares"
i mean, during my show, Chat activity is low if not none
Just be better to try again next weekend and see how it goes, if it keeps dropping, I guess you can look into it
And I can't be there at that time to bring activity
hmmm
um, what kind of puzzle games?
well, everyone seems to be busy that day :(
and like its SUPER active during SNS
which is right after my show
hey, does this sound right to you: 4-7 minutes of 4 player Co-op gameplay (L4D2)=roughly 4MB of data transmitted?
Seems fair
hmm, that's not that bad then...
If you could get that down to 1-2 MB-ish, dialup players could play.
(Not joking)
so that would average around 34MB per day if I played for a full hour, of course a single campaign normally takes less than that...
As in X character does Y action and Z character doesn't know while A audience already saw what happened
:| i dont remember
I suppose.
:D sorry bout that, but on the plus side of things, this has brightened up my day a lot. I now know I can play online everyday using my phone as a modem without burning through my 5 gig a month data plan
04>________________________________<
04WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING
04WHAT THE F***
I can't believe that Pokemon has turned into Animal Crossing
"4-7 minutes of 4 player Co-op gameplay (L4D2)=roughly 4M"
:O
:o
oh waaiit o.O
Hi
Animal Crossing 3DS preview much x.x
(:
lol...
a figure I observed, but it might as well be an arbitrary number. not quite sure what the set of numbers displayed on my phone actually mean
I am just assuming
I could check next time I play L4D2
Please do :D
I'll see what my average net usage while playing is (in speed)
Right now
oh, I am not worried about speed. I just want to know how much data is burned through during a session
That's what I'm trying to help you find out
ah, k
ah o3o
/me is doing english homework involving it
Assuming average speed is the same for you, we know how much usage per hour you have
I can read Shakespearean but hells to know if we know if he dies
if we never heard the story before
/me is now away: gone (22:52:57)
04besides
prolly is not, but if I run at les speed than you(likely,as I am using a 3G network for my connection), then I prolly am burning through less data
04it's kinda not really meaningful anyway
3mbir wireless here
bit*
it is
if you want to catch older generation creatures
04There's nothing to do in Black City but fight somewhat easy battles (no, really, a lot are easy), and nothing to do in White Forest but find wild Pok√©mon from past gens which you can do in HGSSDPPt and trade
04Yeah you can find past gens outside White Forest as well :P
I WANT to find Pokemon from past generations
but cannot trade
04Why not?
I don't own to DS systems
unlike some of you
04oh
;o
04THEN that's a problem :P
I would have to have someone hold them for me when I switch cartridges
04I only have two because my sister doesn't use hers anymore lol
alright, 106ms ping time, 996 kbps download, 419 kbps upload. Not the best, but it is playable
even though I can afford it I don't think Black or White will be worth the $40
04bbl
I would have to hack and cheat
otherwise either one is not worth the money
02LOL Gurren Lagann reference :3

Hi
today i tried Motion instead of after effects for a bit
How was it?
its based on a different ideology
Heh
K
Also junh
so i get the intention that, things are based on behaviours, rather than keyframes,
You think you have any idea how I can fix my problem?
Hm
which is good if you're a noob and want something to move,
EW PIDGIN
Maybe it's because I installed it onto my I:/ drive...
but maybe not so good if you want to move it precisely.
I'll check into that tomorrow
you can do keyframes in motion tho
Warning: Some content may be found unsuitable for some users. Discretion advised.
For help on how to use the bot, _help help. _ajoin add to add to autojoin.
its just not "preffered", i think?
o_O
I need to find out how to clear out some space on my C:/ drive as well >_>
Heh
woah
Interesting
but one consequence, is
I preffer keyframing because it's easier to me
!peak
Yay taking a class on Flash?
Repawd's bot
i'm used to keyframes because it correlates well with audio automation points, which i do all the time
o.o
IT'S ALIVE
I wonder if I was here May 3rd |P
say you wanted to have an object continuisly rotate.
I use Flash
So
Keyframes
Are kinda naturally workable for me
:E
in aftereffets, you draw 2 KFs and hope its big enough. in Motion, you just apply a "rotate", and set the speed.
omaigawd
You can move keyframes ;3
or else, you can use expressions, if you're comfortable with maths/programming
ooooh that reminds me
yea, you can also move start & end points of behaviours
K
beeen using a a bit of expressions lately, kinda handy.
So basically it depends on your preference?
As to what program one should use more often?
it depends on what you're used to before, and or what you want to do.
probably.
i've put like, 30hours into one project in AFX. i probably don't want to switch.
Usually my thought is if its easy its less powerful
But that's sometimes inaccurate :E
hurrrr
true,
one thing i found really easy in M is creating particles from stuff,
Kewl
like text, its sorta hard in AFX but easy in M
Text is hard in AE?
Or should I say √Ü
/me hides
particles based on text
ah
Huh
and the manipulation based on.
Maybe using a combo of both can do wonders? :3
particles on text
err, particles of text
trollface.jpg
one thing that i've been wanting to do for a while is to "rain text" of specific letters, say a phrase.
You made... A bot... Named Hentai?

a codec is a piece of hardware or software that encodes and decodes audio or video information
so saying "I HAVE A MOV THAT WONT OPEN!!!" isn't very informative at all. You have specified the container [mov], but not the compression schemes inside it [h264,sorenson] for video, or [aiff,ima,aac] for video.
which is what really matters.
plus you can find some oddball codecs used in some containers
for example I have seen Windows Media Video in the AVI container
containers [avi,mov,mp4] CONTAIN codecs which use compression schemes [xvid,h264,sorenson] , to store stuff. those are only a few examples. so do you get it now?
hmm..
_help help
darn
you may be able to change codec independent of container using some tools, and vice-versa,
a process known as demuxing
splitting the streams within a container into individual files or streams

03I think that's pretty accurate XD
12night kos
12what's there to figure out about collecting DVDS
12put them away don't scratch them, don't give them to your 3 year old sibling
12the end
03LOL
03because some of them have more than one release and others are confusing and/or hard to find
finding rare or import ones might be good information to add
03what's there to figure out about Pok√©mon cards, you just buy them
12what are those type dvds i see out there now
03The majority of people don't own region-free DVD players and it just makes things more confusing
the rare ones are basically ANY Pokemon Johto discs
Master Quest, Johto Journeys, and Johto League Champions
ANY NTSC region 1 discs that is
03yeah
that is what I mean't
03well 1 and 2 are still being made as are all the AG stuff
12i see pokemon dvds out there that are specified for a type
12like there will be a dark type dvd
03oh
03yeah those are Pok√©mon Elements
ANY NTSC region 1 Johto Journeys, Johto League Champions, or Master Quest discs are rare
03which are stupid
03they're just the normal episodes but rearranged
12well what the heck is the point?
03though I think I'll add it to the thread
03Umbreon, raking in more money
03I bought them just because I collect them
03but they're dumb
12how many episodes are in each element one? XD
or calling Viz out for their licensing idiocy
033
or there release idiocy
03so it's really a waste of money
12and what determines what episodes they choose lol
03No idea
03the only use for them
03and this is why I got the
03m
12electric pokemon
03is for Orange Islands and Master Quest
12narrows it down to every episode ever made
12XD
03they're better quality than the normal discs
03since those had like 12 episodes a disc
03rather than 3
but they frick rare
03that's really the only use I see in those and most people aren't quality wh0res like me
and frick expensive
03Orange isn't rare
12i have the first master quest box set
03I have both
03but my first set is pretty scratched up :/
03it still works thank god
12i remember i only wanted the hocus pokemon episode
12and it was the very last episode in the set
12XD
12lucky me
I am just annoyed with Viz
Magna Pacific FTW!
03eh
03Magna Pacific released movie 8
03honestly I don't like them much
03they make really barebones stuff
03and I mean
03movie 8 was only like 3GB
03and bad quality
03why not fill the stupid disc up
I mean for Pokemon original series box sets
03I know
03I'm talking about the 8th movie Australian release
unlike Viz they released the ENITRE original series on DVD
03the only way to get it in widescreen
and they are all easy to find!
03so did Viz, they just stopped making them
because they are idiots
03if you were to buy them several years ago you woulda been fine LOL
03I know
03I hate VIZ too but I'd rather have NTSC
03since it's native NTS
03*C
for me PAL is better than nothing
far better

03"For Crying Out Loud"
03"Go Go Ludicolo"

03"A Different Kind of Misty!"
03there's also that

03what's the second one?
For Cryin' Out Loud is from Johto
its Misty saving a baby Marill
03ah
03explains why there's a Marill on the cover of hte disc
03*the
on the Region 4 PAL DVD set the disc with For Cryin' Out Loud has a picture of Charizard on it

possibly because Charizard Chills is on it

03oh cool
03so Heroes is anamorphic WS?
I dont have M4, so i can't tell the splitpoint.
yes, its baisically the same as the R2, but blockier because of DTS+AC3+AC3
03er
03the R2 is 4:3
03not WS
03it SAYS it's WS but it's not
R2J
03oh

03I'll just wait til Yauncle rips it then I guess
03no R4s of the Pok√©mon movies before 8 I assume?
I have not seen any for sale or rent
03OK
03that movie 8 is kinda fail
03though, it's region free which is cool
03but it's literally less than 4GB
owait,

03why?
03I'm busy watching music videos XD
eh,
k i was getting a bit tired of typing
03LOL fail
>bbl
03k
/me np: Jessica Andrews - Who I Am (Classic Country 1630) [00:00m/128kbps/44kHz]
this stream I think is what is of what is called a part 15 AM station
12!Pokemon
Umbreon, you are a 11Azurill.
part 15 refers to the section of the FCC rules in the US making this type of license free operation legal
its called different things in different parts of the world of course
12i could use your help
03what
12i don't like the new WLM
12so tell me of another alternative program that is good besides pidgin
03just use the old WLM
03:P
03wait crap
03my server's down
03well you could try aMSN
12aMSN?
03alternative MSN messenger
03yeah
12did you ever try it?
03yeah
03it's alright
03a bit primitive but whatever
03so is IRC XD
12XD
IRC is very developed.
I can downloadin, i can uploadin, i can has script, etcetc
03those are all addons
03Technically DCC isn't really part of IRC
03hence the name "direct client connection"
oh & btw drf,
03LOL a parody of Billy Idol
03watching the video for UHF
i herd you wanted more infos on R4s
hilarious huh
03yeah
03I figured you'd like that song XD
M1 FS, M2 WS,
"LOOK AT MY BUTT"
M3 WS Flippy (Audio/Visually impaired/not versions)
12o-O
I have the music video myself
12!pokemon
Umbreon, you are a 4Pignite.
its on the UHF DVD disc
03woah
03it has an audio description?
03has all of his music videos except the new stuff
its has a something else, i cant remember, but i striped it when i copied it
03oh
03were movies 2 and 3 WB?
yep
03hm
03prolly the same transfer as the R2UK then?
yes
03OK
03what about movie 5 though
M4 WS (I rented the unshrunk REAL DVD6), not the fake shrunk R4 with stripped norwegian audio on ADC/TPB (R2U)
M5 unkown, it was on ssale a few years ago, may still be on auction sites.
03is that one slightly gutterboxed?
03@ movie 4
yes
03as the UK is
03R2UK is dual layer too
03and I own it
M6&7 i have not seen. M8 WS Last of speedups.
03I imported 3, 4, 5, 6
03yeah the non speedups suck
03and you gave me 8
036 I have from the UK
037 only exists in Belgium for whatever reason
03er Netherlands
M9+ WS, telecine of the type that i am unable to fix.
Chronicles, telecine of the type i can fix.
6 r2
*^
well, almost all the DVDs are obslete now, that we have or will have HD rips.
, like my M9 HD & M12 HD
not entirely
03I still want to have DVDs
(i'm talkin about the movies)
as am I
dust & scratches in baisically the same places
wow
so no luck
its from the same transfer then
when did that DVD come out anyway
same xfer, or same reeel
2000-4 or something?
& drf, i compared the R4 of M8 to a NTSC a few years ago, slightly sharper
same reel I would believe
or reels more like it
strange to think that even though its full screen and SD the 2001 NTSC DVD release looks a little better than the HD wide screen released in 2010
03my mom hates this song XD
well, mb cuz the edge dust is cropped off?
I doubt that
trollface.jpg
.-.
I F***ING HATE THE ANDROID LOW BATTERY ALERT
03then turn it off?
its loud, its startling, its sharp, its painful
I CAN'T
03o.o
03my phone can
03just keep the media volume off
03turn it up when you're watching videos, turn it back down when you're done
03if the volume is off it won't beep]
I can't turn the volume down
03wtf
because its from a Chinese company
03there's no volume control?
with incompetant programmers
03Menu - settings - sound settings
03check Silent Mode?
trollface.jpg
I will try that
if not its time to fire off a complaint
because the company who made the tablet does provide support on a forum officially
12amsn is giving me a headache
I tried
nothing
the dangerously loud and startling sounds are STILL active
o_O
03wtf
12drf ever used or heard anything about trillian?
the silent mode does not silence the alarms
so no luck there
.-.
http://www.chinadigitalcomm.com/android-f60/feature-request-system-sounds-volume-control-disable-t3051.html
well here is the post
03Umbreon I have but I have no idea how to eve find that program
but on the plus side Adobe Flash is finally working
12o-O
12google?
12or is that too nooby?
ok, finally to take a break from the frightening tablet
03well Umbreon
03the problem is
03"trillian" is also a number
03as in 1000 billion
03so yeah
i suggest pidgin: its free
http://www.trillian.im/
03EW GAY-M
found it
12i never had problems
03and likes it
03so eh
might as well suggest trying Boolean searches as well
i use pidgin & liek
so does bayalex & a few other ppl
12oh
12pidgin doesn't appeal to me for some reason
the Trillian Android client does not look too bad
I might have to try it
/me can also recommend Trillian.
03WOAH
03I'm trying to play this AVI on my DSTWO flash card
yay, my tablet will run it!
03the audio is completely f***ed up
03and it's my Articuno and Lugia tribute
03apparently it doesn't like LPCM.
2.2 is supported
plus the slogan is amusing
Power up your little robot!
03hm
03so far only one file plays LOL
yes I would certainly like more power for R2D2
or C3PO
I am just going to charge the battery now
03hm
03seems the DSTWO only truly works with XVID
so that I don't jump the next time I switch the tablet on I don't jump
03newer codecs tend to get screwed up
oops
redundancy
03it can play WMV, but it skips a lot
03etc
still a bit on edge
I guess that has a coprocessor
its the only way since the DS does not have much processing power
03yes
03the DSTWO has a 400MHz ARM processor on the card
03so it can do stuff like GBA emulation etc
impressive
03but it also features a video play
03*player
you thinking what I am
03whereas usually you have to use Moonshell on specially-encoded files
ANDROID ANYONE
/me runs
03LOL
03hm
that would be cool
03apparently WMVs do work, if they're small enough

03LOL
03this Scene rip of Tron Legacy works fine

Now it's mostly a way for legacy systems to get upgraded to modern platforms.
(In other words, the only people still buying OpenVMS are those who ran VMS on DEC VAX and DEC Alpha machines, and have a massive vested codebase.)
The only other people running OpenVMS are hobbyists (like me) who are not viable revenue sources for HP.
Indeed
Becuase we're not buying their brand new Itanium boxes. Becuase either we're running VAXen for the history, Alphas becuase of either the history (early systems) or because they're getting tossed in the rubbish bin (later systems), or early Itaniums due to them also being discarded.

If you read the article it states quite clearly: "Actual risk of stuff happening: Well instead of a 25% chance of cancer in your liftime it might now be 25.001%"
right, thats atleast a relief
Or in English "Yeah... effects are zilch, zero, none, absolutely nothing."
And that's from the people working in the plant. :P
The "spike" of radiation outside of the plant would require you to be outside FOR A MONTH, with that very miniscule level.
Which has already gone away becuase... it's decayed. :P

It's up to 25% now
Like, aaaaaaaaaaall the way out
6Eh, if you wanna RP, sure. :P
And it had to be like that for at least an hour or two
12lol
12Yes, I spent 2 hours editing that
My battery on this computer was at 0% for months
/me would pay someone to cut his hair rofl
surprisingly I didn't have to buy a new one
Oh wow :O
12XD
It's really hard to get a battery out of 0% after it's been sitting there for a while...
The battery life is probably like 90 minutes at best, but it still works
XD
/me is back from: gone (been away for 18hrs 50mins 16secs)
I just sort of forgot about this computer after I got my new one...
I'm sure I damaged my battery :x
12Maybe I should do one of N *Shot*
I don't know if running it all the way down once or twice really hurts much
It's happened to me a lot
no that would be cool!

03they made it so jumbo sized that the Pok√©mon logo on the back of it is kinda pixelated
03because that artwork was only made with so much DPI LOL
10Really?
10Can you take a pic of it?
03yep
03I can try
03it might not show
03it's the same design on the back as like
03normal Pok√©mon cards
03and I mean the original first-gen ones I've had since 1998 XD

13That card is huge |D
03but if you look in the center ofthe Pok√©ball, where the black ring is
10It's not bent or anything, yes?
03nope, there's just a little mark at the top
03prolly the post office's fault
03but no bends
10Good

fucking lucky you bastard
also
did you like chapter 18? XD
if you've read it
03FFS
03They take about 15% of the price
03so I'll have to charge like 15% more so I get my money :/
03of course that's only about $2 but still XD
10That's fine
03Our Create a Product Detail Page feature is available only to Pro Merchants

03if the page for the item exists
03i can list it
03XD
04I feel more like seeing how DoI would turn out as a comic so I'm gonna draw a couple of practic pages.
03I just can't create a new one without being a pro merchant
03and I'd have to pay $40 to become oine
03*one
10well
10Amazon doesn't have that card
10which is the whole reason I requested it on eBay
10hm
12Just find something that‚Äôs out of stock
03or if there's a similar card
12Don't have to be a card
03or just a genereic Pok√©mon Card listing LOL

10yeah
10I get home from school around 3 PM
10so if not, save it for Monday
03what I can do is just take this envelope and stick it in a padded envelope
03like, the guy packed it well
ALTAIR
03he took the card, then put it next to a piece of cardboard and put it in a manilla envelope
SNEAS
03I can take that whole thing and put it in a padded one
03as long as your parents don;'t go inspecting the thing
03because then they might be like "wtf is this other address" XD
03or I could like, scribble it out with a marker
Heya
10yeah
/me hugs
10do that
03hi lolz.
10or white out, if it's possible

03hopefully your parents wouldn't mind that the picture's a little different?
10Nope
03k
10I'll tell them there's two different versions of the card
10They won't know the difference XD
03OK
03yeah I hated having to go through my parents to buy stuff
03I'm glad I can do it myself now XD

03Triple battles are retarded

don't need to ask

lots of people are disappointed with the fifth generation games

03about the only thing I like about them is the music

03the only annoying thing about Emerald
next they're going to have 6-pokemon battles.
03is that you can't run inside building
03*s
EXTREMELY FUN HURR DURR
03I was like OMGYAY RUNNING SHOES
Want to help me test this map I made?
03then I'd walk inside and be like -_-
03rofl
some people say that Advanced Generation nearly killed Pokemon
03"Id like to see anyone who complained in this thread design a better game than BW." <- Um, all the other ones?
03well, it nearly killed the *anime*
03the games on the other hand
03I have quite a few IRL friends who had only ever played Red and Blue
03and then got back into it when Ruby and Sapphire came out
03I remember back when I was in middle school when RS were new
03there were like 20 kids I'd hang out with
03and we'd all trade and battle and stuff
I think the Pokemon anime should have died with Advanced Generation
03I was offering hacked Deoxys and Jirachi XD
03XD
06It's just desperately going LALALA I'M NOT LISTENING TO YOUR OPINION
04Hmm...now?
03yeah
03The complaints are valid
Whenever you can.
03I agree with most of them
03except the guy saying he wants more triple battles
03as those pissed me off
03luckily they aren't mandatory
.________.
the show's international staying power has almost entirely disappeared
03but heck, even double battles are bad enough
tell him to go PO himself
03in DPP, at least, you can avoid most of the double battles
03but not in BW
and pit his own teams against each other or something
06lolwut
06Where does that become relevant? xD
03like, in DPP, you see two people standing next to each other
03you're like "Oh look, double battle"
03walk up and talk to one
03it's a 1 on 1
03then do the same for the other
03XD
03but in BW, you talk to one, both respond >_>
06and now DARK GRASS UMAD? all up in it
>dark grass
bug
OH SNAP
I can't believe I remember the days when it seemed like everyone was watching the show and cared about it
06Lol
03yeah
03well
03see
03I only remember the Johto days
03because when Indigo came out I was like 8
and they made such a crappy dark/dragon pokemon
03and most people didn't watch it LOL
03but I remember watching Master Quest when it was current
I remember the days of Kanto, the Orange Islands, and Johto
zekrom and reshiram should have been dark/psychic dragon
06I haven't watched anything after Johto really
now that would have been cool
03Master Quest was the first season I actually watched on the air
03the rest I had to go back and watch my DVDs

03and you know
I was 10 when the show came to the US

03then something came up
03D
03*XD
13Then again, I also fail to see how Gyarados is part flying-type, so :B
06It's a DRAGON THING
lol
;o
06Some types just make no sense anyway
13Gyarados' typing is just BAD though
13As far as I know, it doesn't even learn any flying-type attacks
13so its typing just basically gives it a x4 weakness to electricity :|
06Lol
13Not that I care, I find that thing annoying as hell to fight against |D
06It's kind of amusing that the things you encounter in caves are usually the most annoying things ever.
06;-;
03those people who complain about BW criticism in that thread
03remind me of people here
03someone starts saying how awesome they thing BW is, I say it's not, they baww me and start whining
03:/
06There's a difference between bashing things and having an opinion
0690% of the internet doesn't know
06:|
03when I bash things
06but that thread is mildly amusing
03that's me having an opinion
03but yeah
oh wow

03-:
03I mean yes I know it gets annoying
06Well it can become a littel repetitive lol
06But still
03but you don't think I get annoyed hearing how awesome someone thinks Reshiram is every 5 seconds?
I understand
OMG Zekrom <3

03my 14 year old sister has a boyfriend now too
10I've seen it as early as 3rd grade, I kid you not
13I caught it several times because I was being picky with nature |D
03what is there to like about girls that young? They're fricking flat chested
/me runs
motherfucking
13Though some of my attempts involved me using every type of pokeball I had
10Thing is, they're too young to even know what a real relationship is like
13eventually I caught a Victini I was happy with in the very first pokeball I threw :B
the fuck
how did they get in with +R

03wtf
Espeon; you sure they don't pull something out of their hat? :P
7Does anyone have a Vullaby?
03I have no idea what that is.
It's not a random attack if they're coming on a daily basis
7Vulture.
^
03is it legendary?
probably just some silly skiddie or something
skiddie?
03they'll be assraped
don't you mean kiddies
14no
skiddie
script+kiddie
03then no.
ah o3o
derp
basically a wannabe "hacker"
7A'ight.
7Just looking for one to fill my pokedex.
7Got Hydreigon today, so... :P
Just send Dr. Hax after them XD
hah
bloody hell
getting botnets like at least once every day
yeah, it be funny to see them scared when he's behind them and he goes "HAAAAAX!"
the only problem with this is how annoying it is
which part, how often the botnets are happening, or Dr. Hax's catchphrase XD
I'll get my men working on it.
/me disappear in smoke.
XD
06ah, skiddies
or who
06They're one step above the kids saying "I got ur IP, good luck getting online tomorrow lololol" after you destroy them in a video game, yet 100 steps below any actual hacker

06I get that daily lol
06It's hilarious
inorite
these botnets are so small
is it just me or are they getting smaller?
03they need to be assraped

03LUCKY EGG.
10>best item in the game
Why do you say that? XD
I'd have to agree.
what's with the sudden my little pony fetish lol
it's a thing going around
what like Charlie the Unicorn?
the show got a fanbase on 4chan and now everyone's watching it
wow
that's just creepy
oh the joys of being an IRCop
trolls one day, botnets the next
then again it's 4chan so it doesn't surprise me
I've seen the show; it's not bad
0.o
The My Little Pony show isn't bad?
But it is surprising that so many guys are watching it
wow never thought I'd hear you say that
It's different than the show from the 80s (apparently)
still lol
06People getting mad at trolls just needs better troll detectors really.
06But yeah.
03:3
sorry but even if a guy is watching it
a new one
it's obviously a kids' show, but the creator tried to make it enjoyable for adults too
/me makes a gagging noise
because they'll have to watch it with their kids
rigghhhhht
I'm gonna stick with.....The Ricky Gervais show
What's that?
:P
it's a podcast lol
just three british guys talking about funny stuff
LOL Did you know that "Dammit I'm Mad" spelled backwards is "Dammit I'm Mad."?
06Spaces doesn't agree with you
:p
well, you can see it anyways :P
Dammit Im mad = dam mi timmad
That's not what it is though
It's a "reboot" of the series
04o-o
04QUAN
Still no less bright and sparkly though
XD
04I need to ask you a question
04What is the sprite size limit in B/W?
04Is it still 80x80?
ohh you must mean this
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_is_Magic
bah, my computer's going crazy... brb
yeah, that's it
Bronies
wow
what is the world coming to
hahahahaha
sorry but even that is too gay for me
I'm not expecting you to like it XD

http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic
just no
7It's 96 x 96.
04ok...thanks
blah
03the sprites in BW suck
03they look a lot worse than HGSS
7Eh, they're not bad.
hope your bf isn't into it
04phew
03right, they aren't bad, they're AWFUL
0495x64
03pixeled as f***
he's not
Lol
04Just within
7You mean when animated, DRF?
wb AE :3 ^_^
that's what he tells you
7Or in general?
03I mean both
03especially the rear-facing ones
03as in
03your Pok√©mon
04In general they don't
03it's fricking pixelated
04it's only when they're animated.
03it looks a lot worse than HGSS
03but the sprites are ALWAYS animated
:P
04I don't mind that
03it looks horrible
next thing you know he'll want to be roleplaying and wanting to join the Bronies
04I still think it's better than the old 2 frame distortion animation of previous gens
You can interrogate him about it when next time he's online if you want :P
7We have opinions. Deal with them. :P
04Besides, there is only so much you can do with pixels.
lol
nah
that would be creepy
if he wanted to roleplay as a pony
I'm not that dickish
o_O
03pretty much everyone I know who's played BW has agreed the sprites look a lot worse than DPP/HGSS
new word that doesn't work
04It'd take too long to make extremely high-res sprites for a game with 500+ pokemon. Especially animated as they are
/me cross it off the list
what list?
06Good night
06nini
7Everyone?
list of words I haven't used before lol
03yep
04gnight
so its not this "perfect video game" that some people see it as
you can put "bronies" on your list too
7Well, other than the graphics, any comments on the storyline? (Please keep spoilers unspoiled.)
Unless you ARE one and you've been lying this whole time
DUN DUN DUN!
03The storyline is alright
03besides the music it's really the only thing I like.
04The music is incredible
13Top three things I look for in a game: Storyline, gameplay and music, in that order
i got like 2 versions of Pokemon Black and White
13I don't care too much for graphics, so long as I enjoy playing it :3
of the OST
03same here, but when it comes to Pok√©mon, the Pok√©mon themselves are a pretty crucial part
13Of course, beautiful graphics are nice to have too
03and I'm not saying I care that much about graphics either, hence why Emerald is my all time favorite game, I'm just saying BW is a step DOWN
03DPP/HGSS had much better graphics than BW.
it is in more ways than one
03exactly
03I mean, yeah it's a fun game, but that's stretching it
03and in order to really enjoy it you need to either speedrun or hack
03or both
and this is coming from someone who can't stand Advanced Generation games
7I meandered through the game at my own pace.
04^
04I enjoyed the graphics.
I dont even own the game D;
/me flees
7I'd say sprite-wise, the third generation had the best sprites.
03yeah
03third gen has the best of a lot of things
03and the reason why? They didn't try to make it too complicated
03as in
03they go ZOMFG ANIMATIONS and look what happened. Crapton of pixelation
7Speaking of complexity, Triple/Rotation battles.
04lolololol
03most retarded thing ever
03I hate triple battles
13I'm terrible at triple/rotation battles
04Triple battles was a stretch, but Rotation?
13|D
03yeah
03Double battles were already bad enough
13They're too damn difficult for me :<
04Double battles were a good addition, but not triple.
13Well, I love double battles
04Really, it's too complex.
13but I'm finding it hard to work with triple battles
03I hate double battles
7Double was okay.
04Not to mention it's hard to FIND triple battles
03that's a GOOD thing
7You have Black, Drake?
04No, White
13especially how even their position on the battle field effects what they can do in the battle :|
7I've only found one rotation battle in White. o.o
03if it was any more I'd rage
03there's only one
04Same Quan
03and there's only one triple battle in Black.
13All the triple battles in White are rotation battles in Black, and vice versa
7Mmm'kay.
7You're usually warned beforehand.
03yeah
04I really hate it when the Quick Claw activates when I use Aqua Jet
7They either ask you to have one or in that house in Opelucid city, there's the guy who says that's a building for triple battles.
7Ah, random probability.
03why would you use Aqua Jet o,.o
03that move isn't even as good as most other water moves
7The priority?
04Because I don't want to risk relying on the Quick Claw.
7Helps for cherry picking.
04And because Carracosta is dead slow.
lol
03what the frick is Carracosta
13Priority move, it can be really useful in some situations :B
hell no
03my Staryu is plenty fast
04The fossil turtle
7Turtle pokemon. :P
I'd sooner become a Cynder fan
03that's why you don't use 5th gen.
03:P
13Quick Claw is broken when it comes to the CPU using one though
04I prefer to only use 5th Gen
04Dunno why
13It ALWAYS activates for them
03that's just stupid though
04lol AE
I thought you liked Cynder
03pretty much any 5th gen can be pwned by a 1-4 gen
03heck
I did
13yet when I try to use it myself, it never activates :|
I still do in limited doses
03I got through the entire game without using a single quick claw or anything of that sort.
when it's not abused
as it has been
04For me it activates alot, but 80% of the time it's when I use Aqua Jet XD
I remember a day when that was considered the RARE pairing to write about
hard to believe
7Hold items?
yeah I know
7I have passive, non-battle-boosting ones.
at least the character had teh chance to be developed better
the LoS fandom seems to be dying down though
04The Rocky Helmet is also awesome
7Amulet Coin and Exp. Share. o3o
I haven't seen a Cynder fantard in a while
/me pokes Drake
03EW THAT FACE
7Still managed.
eh they'll come and go
03yeah I used those twoo
03-o
Spyro in general isn't nearly as active as it has been or prolly will ever b e
03but that doesn't actually help you :P
7Exactly.
03Exp share just helps with leveling
04?
04Huh
Yeah
03but seriously
04I never realised how powerful Cruch Claw is on a Braviary
03when I beat the Elite Four, I had less than 10 Pok√©mon.
especially now with this Skylanders crap
03because all I did was trade 6 relatively good first-gens and pwned everyone with them.
7Caught?
Have you been playing Mass effect
04I only catch the Pokemon I'll use for my team.
03and it wasn't even level-abuse, they were normal levels.
03Yeah
03they were from HeartGold.
03I just traded them to White
03well
7I catch everything. :P
03"forced trading"
03as do I
03but
03if it's 5th gen, I don't catch it.
04yes
7Lol.
03I just got a team of 6 so I could trade
7Ah, such a bias.
03it's because they're fricking stupid
7Your opinion.
13Does anyone else have really bad luck when it comes to critical hits on B/W or is it just me? :|
04^
03the opinion of about 90% of Pok√©;mon fans.
04Me to
7[citation needed]
03it's just you
7@ DRF.
04The opponent ALWAYS uses crits, but I never get them.
13Because in nearly every battle I have, the opponent lands a critical hit on me
13:<
03if you go search for like "pokemon black white review"
12Opinion! = Fact
hmm...I've decided against doing an all pokemon music special on my show
7I have a Unfezant I've oriented especially toward crits.
04ouch
7She crits about 50% of the time.
03well it also depends on the move
03use something like Shadow Claw if you want critical hits
03I just rely on type advantages
03ultimately, just get a team of 6 different types
03and you sould be set against about 95% of enemies.
04It's not that I want them
04It's that they always land on me
03LOL
13They always happen to land the critical hits right when I don't want them too
03Same here but several of my Pok√©mon are tanks so it doesn't even damage me that much
13for example, when I bring out a Pokemon with a type advantage over the one I'm up against
Drake; So then, how would someone of a good guy calibur react to say...
7I've based my team off of types as well.
the Forces of Chais
04I have a single tank
*Chaos
04Carracosta
13and the damn thing 1-hit-KOs me with a move that is "not very effective"
03I have Vileplume and Arcanone
04Half my team are sweepers
03both of them are really powerful
04I dunno
04It depends
7I've got dragon, dark, flying, water, normal, fire, fighting, steel, ground as my list.
04The Council would ignore them
03LOL WTF DARK
03the only thing I lack is ground
03well, and ice
04And most good guys would try and open negotiations but get cut down
03I've got fire, fighting, grass, poison, water, flying, ghost, and um
And how would they react in Warcraft?
against THE RUINOUS POWERS OF CHAOS
yep
7Oh, and electric.
looking forward to it already
03yeah
03electric.
7Lol.
03my Pikachu XD
04I have Dragon, Dark, Rock, Water, Flying, Normal, Ghost, Fire, Psychic
03I was forgetting my 5th
03*6th
Right
I'm the god of Chaos btw.
04And I want a Bug Type
03EW BUG TYPES
03I hate bugs :|
04Or a fighting
03and really
I am being sarcastic of course lol
03I fail to see a point in dark
04Something to balance it out
03it's only good against ghost, and so is psychic...
7Against Psychic types.
13Bug types and fighting types all over the place in B/W
04um
13take your pick xD
03then use ghost type.
04Psychic isn't good against Ghost
I'll totally pay $75 for anything that has Spyro in it, even if it's crap
Oh, I know lol
03er
03right
7o.o
03I had that the other way around
04Espy, I don't like any of them XD
03ghost is strong against psychic
03but, isn't ghost also strong against itself?
03like dragon?
7You mean weak?
04yeah
yep
03both strong and weak.
already looking forward to it
03Strong if you're using it
03weak if you get hit
03:P
03so yeah there you go
7Yes.
03just get a ghost type
damn I'm gettin gold
03what's the point of dark?>
"old"
Gold would be nice too though..
7Because the damage is not amplified on both ends.
04Dark was to balance out the overpowered Psychic in Gen 2
03Steel I can understand but dark type was just retarded
03I felt the same way back when gen 2 came out and I still think so now.
I don't know if being gold would be very nice, actually :P
04Psychic was just a gamebreaker in Gen 1, so in Gen 2 they needed something to balance it out
03heh
03well
you are not Khorne
03that's my only problem with Haunter/Gengar.
03the fact that it's not pure ghost
03so stuff like psychic can do tons of damage x.x
03but otherwise my Haunter is a fricking beast
13In a way, normal-types are just as bad |D
03It has a Dark type *move*, but yeah
one of my favorite songs in that game
03I mean, Crunch is a good attack.
13Not super-effective against anything, and plenty of types resist it
03well yeah
03normal is kinda stupid
03unless you're like
03Chansey
03that thing is awesome
03Blissey even more so
04It has a wide range of moves
03fricking tanks
04And only one weakness
7Helpful against ghost types.
7:P
04^
04I never got that
13My Umbreon took down a Blissey in two hits once
13I still dunno how it happened |D
03and get this
04Normal doesn't effect Ghost, and Ghost doesn't effect Normal
04It's like a stalemate
03Articuno agrees with me that 5th generation sucks
03:P
03and I have proof to back it up
I agree with you drf
03I know you do
how dare you forget to mention me
>:(
03but most people here don't care what you think :|
04Um
04LOL
xD
true
03like the fact that people who get butthurt over me EW'ing something need to go die in a fire
03but whatever
XD
13I'm neutral to most of 5th gen
7Hmm.
most people don't care about what others think
04This is what I think
I try to be as open-minded as possible
13I think some are awful, but there's some that I'm practically in love with
04Gen 5 has the extreme of both good and bad.
13and I don't really care about any of the others
^
03I have yet to see any that I actually lik,e
nintendo is the extreme of fail.
125th gen came out with some of my favorite Pokemon :P
o_o
03they're either ripoffs of other Pok√©mon, or ripoffs of objects, or just plain stupid
04I mean
so of course their products would be extreme too
04Hydreigon
04I've been waiting since Gen 2 for a Dark/Dragon type.
7Ripoffs, right.
03like what's that cat thing
03it's just a ripoff of Skitty
7Well, pokemon is getting more 'natural' as the series goes on.
04Leipard and Purrloin
03it looks exactly like Skitty mixed with its evolved form.
7They're called expies, DRF.
03ex pies?
03they used to be pies?
03nice to knlw
03I'm gonna go eat one
7No, you fish. :P
pokemon is technically a ripoff of digimon in a way
7There are certain pokemon in each generation meant to emulate a previous generation's.
<Drake> I've been waiting since Gen 2 for a Dark/Dragon type.
04OOOOH
04Should my Braviary learn Brave Bird?
03no
well Sanzador or w/e it was called
03that move sucks
sucks
7Yes.
brave bird is decent
fly sucks
03Dude
03fly is the best thing ever
7Lol, DRF.
fly MISSES
03especially if you've poisoned your enemy
oh lol stall
03no see
04It currently knows Aerial Ace, Fly, Crush Claw and Tailwind
03here's what you do
03yeah
I can't stand stalling
03poison them
03then use fly
03wtf is tailwind
delete Aerial Ace or Tailwind
04Increases your team's speed for 2-5 turns
03ew
7It does 33.25 damage average a turn.
03delete tailwind
7@ Fly.
03er
03what
04Braviary is fast enough so eh
03it does 90
03and it takes two turns
03that's 45
03where did your math come from
7It's been up'd to 90 in the fifth generation?
03yeah
03apparently
03either that or Fearow hx
/me runs
03*hax
04I thought it was always 90...
03me too
13^
brave bird is powerful
03it's powerful but it only has 5PP and it lowers your stats
I use it with staraptor
03and I hate move slike that
my extremely weird staraptor
04...no
7Lowers stats?
04Brave Bird deals damage like Take Down
03oh
03then that
03I was thinking CLose Combat, my bad
7Waaaait:
04lol NS
03but yeah
03I hate both moves
close combat is actually good
7It's been 90 since Gen. 4? O__o
03any of those 5PP moves that either do recoil damage or lower your stats
03they annoy me
03Yep.
04Hey
/me 7LOLs.
03Fly and Surf are like the most pro things ever
surf is good
03yeah
03I love Surf
7I've got the Gen. 3 stats in my mind.
03lik even in battle
03it's fricking epic
7Surf is good.
7Fly is meh.
03well
surf > muddy water
03I'm like
03who cares if it takes two turns
03they can't hit you
03when you're in the air
03so it really doesn't matter
7Thunder?
they can with twister
which does double damage if you are in the air
03well, then don't use Fly if you're fighting an electric type.
03but as I was saying
twiiiister
03I turned battle animations off so it's just like fly, bam bam damage
twister...twitter
03the battle animations in BW give me a massive headache
mind blown
03because of how it keeps zooming in on the Pok√©mon
03it's like AHHHHHH MY EYES
7I like them, lol.
03well
7O.o
03I hate the camera effects.
wat
03it's like
03picture looking through a camera
XD
03zoom it in and out 20 times a minmute
03-m
7It's a spectacle.
03unless you're like, super hardcore, you're going to get dizzy.
03and that's what happened to me.
03when I first started BW it made me dizzy so I turned them off :|
7No one else commented on the dynamic camera.
03most people prolly don't care
7Yep.
03and the weird thing is I'm not photosensitive or anything
7You do.
03like I've watched the Porygon episode a million times
03and never had any problems
7Gah, I'm pretty late in piano. X.x
7Fish you, IRC.
03well no, that's wrong. After a few loops of it I started getting dizzy.
03but still
/me 7AFKs.
/me JFKs
03anyway
/me NOMs
xD
03I should like
03get dinner
03where should I eat
yeah
03I think I'll do Wendy's
go eat some vore or something
/me hides
03EW
/me runs
03well
03also
03you know what sucks
03in an hour, they are shutting off the water for the entire building
03including all bathrooms and everything
03until tomorrow morning
03so :|
03though being a guy I can always just pee out the window
03I mean hi
x.x
XD
DO IT
lmfao
03LOL
03inb4 I hit someone
XD
03as I'm on the 4th floor
03I would laugh so hard
03they wouldn't
lmfao
kill them with pee!
/me hides
03you know how gross that would be?
03well
or just humilate them
xD
03Ultimately, you don't need to flush the toilets
03I can just use them normally and not flush XD
put julia gillard underneath your window
pee
???
PROFIT
03and washing your hands is overrated
03who?
australia's prime minister
03oh
03LOL
who is a complete retard
XD
03>Politicians
03of course
or tony abbott for that matter
oh gosh
!EW POLITICS
15EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW POLITICS
so true
politicians make me want to rape my own mind
seriously
not like it's possible
this is why I hate most talk radio shows
03LOL
but
they are all politics or religion
03LOL Nick
03er
03on our TV listings cahnnel
XD
03they have talk radio as the audio
03it gets so annoying
it does
03I try to see what's on TV and I have to hear some crap about Libya
03I'm like NO U
03and mute it
but seriouisly
politicis
well, I get to go work now, yay
politics
what sucks is that talk radio is about all you get in some areas on AM
03I know
see ya
03that's why I use FM :P
Politics suck butt
mfw they think they're doing it right
03XD
03you know
03I've had a couple people tell me that I'd make a good world ruler
03who agrees
/me runs
lmfaaaaaao
03first things I'd do
I can imagine that
03shut down the MPAA and RIAA
I have a few oldies stations, a country station, Radio Disney, and one of the last full service stations in the country
03and tell Apple to go f*** themselves
lmfao
XD
03then I'd legalize piracy.
03and then
03???
03Profit
ALSO, you should get rid of every crappy tv show on MTV
x.x
03oh
03yeah
03I can just shut down MTV
03there's no reason we still need it
03when piracy is legal
03:P
not to mention my own AM transmitter so if I don't like what I hear FU I can switch it on and have my OWN music on the air!
03LOL
03why broadcast your own stuff and then use a radio
03that's just lossy
03just hook the computer up to your speakers XD
not really
03eh
03anyway
03gonna go get dinner
03I think I'll do Wendy's
XD
03note I said 's
well
03not "do Wendy"
03there's a difference
plus its really nice for adjusting receivers
drf, make nothing on the internet illegal
make everything free
calibrating the dial
03XD
Make FL Studio Free
/me runs
make everyone give me free dedicated servers
???
PROFIT
03LOL
FL studio is easy to pirate
03:P
and the transmitter is for AM stereo which is GONE from the dial in my area
just download the portable version
XD
so I am making receivers that get it useful again
I have FL S 9 x.x
S.*
but like
03anyway
03gonna go eat dinner
politicians can go fuc* themselves in the ass
oh wait
they already do that
03you guys can start as a "DRF for world ruler" club if you want
03XD
lol
seeya drf
!lag
lmfao drf
anyone want a nintendo ds lite for $70?

03guys, does anyone here have experience catchiung Zoroark in BW?
03I'm curious if it's always female
03or if it can be male
12zoroark is always female
12zorua is always male
0387.5% male, 12.5% female
03not according to this
03or do you just mean in the game
12the special event zoroark is always female though
03ah
12because it's supposed to be a tribute to the zoroark movie
03wait what
03so you get a male Zorua and a female Zoroark? LOL
12yes
12you get a female zoroark if you got the shiny legendary dogs
03k
12and you can get a zorua if you got the celebii from gamestop
03Yeah
03that's what I'm doing XZD
03*XD
12the zorua will always be male
12XD
03is there a particular nature I should look for?
12i'd say for zoroark
03hm
03well
03my Zorua is Serious nature
03so w/e
12something that boosts speed or special attack
!pokemon
12i'd say speed
12120 base special attack and 105 base speed
12i'd say anything that boosts special attack or speed
12and drops a defense stat is good because attack is pretty decent as well
