Polydunami: he walked in and said "here I got you something, since you like girly shit"
I have had real difficulty trying to become a lucid dreamer, I haven't been able to remember a dream in I don't know how long
MahBoi777: cake
CAKE O_O
0,14I've managed to travel in dreams though, there was a neat one where I woke (in the dream), and everything was o the other side
Shizuka I studied lucid dreaming for a bit. It's best to be reclined when sleeping I read
Shizuka: have you tried using music as a focus for the transition?
MahBoi777: yes
MahBoi777: Did you just say cake?
13can't use music
13sleeping with earbuds is painful
Polydunami: and hands me a Power puff girls cup, I just laughed and asked him if he likes fosters home for imaginary friends.
So what girl did he bribe to use the pail, panda? xP
SaxyPretender one lucid dream I had, I was doing Super-Jumps. It was awesome
that ring with the blades inside is called a Fennestron
I MADE MUFFINS!
Shizuka: ooh, true. a fair point

I found one of the best ways to get to somewhat on control in dreams is to wake up a bit earlier than your usual wake up time. Stay up for a bit then go back to sleep. I actually had more memory by then with a dream journal
MahBoi777: (\
NommyDash: It wont fit thought my computer

Guys i feel bad. I can never remember my dreams
Umm, this movie is easy to follow

03which one
03also I never went anywhere
WASN'T SO GREAT?!? WHY I OUGHTA
I mean wut
:D
the guy who got a 0 on his test
03yeah
03I showed it in here too
oh
C is not always the answer
whats the point of chat when no ones chatting?
oi drf
running traceroute on any of the server's IPs
will give the VM's IP
er
host machine's IP
03well
03that's probably normal
03given that it has to go through the host?
raaaaaaaaaage iptables isn't installed
true
but it also reveals the IP
03am I the only person who doesn't care about IPs?
lol well
the host machine would be far easier to hack than the domUs
problem, internet?
definitely
and ohai Feather /late
03wait, why wasn't the bot voiced already
03o_O
03didn't we autovoice it?
03unless I turned the VMs on in the wrong order
03oh also
?
03is there a way to autorun screen irssi at start?
03for the Liknux VM
03-k
probably not
03I have to keep redoing it every time the server gets attacked
03:/
well
blarg
03I should also look into making irssi autoconnect/join
anyone left alive?
03I have to manually do it
if so, my appologies

03uh
03well
if you connect to irc.ponychat.net you'll be back on the network
Why is there only twenty people?
03the command itself is just "screen irssi"
-dmS name Start as daemon: Screen session in detached mode.
you're in a bubble
not on the network
screen -dmS irssi
add that to crons or something
crontab -e
Does anypony know why there is only 20 of us here?
should be @reboot
HOLY SHIT
03uh
03can you do all that

Sumica and the rather annoying effect of space junk building up
Don't worry, Phase4; I was already distracted from going to bed.
and now a flutteryshy song can't remember the name "wonderful place"?
/me 00,02hugs Polydunami
00,10well most of it is in extra solar orbit
HOOOOONEEEEEEEEEEEEY!
00,10also Phase4 I want this song
^
00,02i has a pointless idea
constant universe http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lljcxcfPVC1qiq96ko1_500.gif
00,02dis song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJiZVcxI_0M&feature=plcp
00,02too metal for me
No such thing Phase
:O
Phase4!!! HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?!
Hey sumica whats up dude
One cannot simply experience too much metal
00,02cause my ears are uncomefortable
Phase4: Any chance we can hear the Winter Wrap up? =3
00,02Vordox, ?
This is tame for me.
00,02after this i'm probably gona just put brony radio on
The original, I haven't heard that song in ages(Especially with the animation)
00,02usualy hase good stuff
Dat Dashie solo.
Spectrum_Plush: Lol that dance
dat pinkies verse
hey sumica you playing this game?
00,10want to try my mountan rocket Phase4?
00,10nah it's Phase4
Dat Pinkie part. <3
oh ok
00,02Sumica, i might
00,02first i'ma build parachute
Pinkie's part always makes me smile.
hey phase 4 whats up
I dont think the metal works as well with the orchestral instruments as much as i wanted it too
Pinkie always makes me smile, Applejazz.
GALAAAAA
[03:36:53] <@Sumica> 00,10I like to set it so the side tanks use the fule first so I can shed them when empty
/me hugs Polydunami
Whoops xD
derp.
I tried that, Sumica
00,02lol Rain
and now credits
Hello everypony
I couldnt get it to work
Polydunami: What I ment was that part makes me smile even more than before. :D
Hi BronyinJapan
Long time no see, BronyinJapan :)
lol Rain
hi BronyinJapan.
Rain it helps to have a central booster that seperates as well
oh phase 4 do the rocket nuke bomb fly test
o hai BronyinJapan
Ohey, BronyinJapan! Been a while.
fuck, my laptop crashed
00,10if you hook the fule lines from the side fule tanks directly to the rocket section rain
also, stacked solid fuel boosters are quite useful in small quantities
/me sheds a single manly tear at this song's ending
00,10it pulls from those tanks first
00,10then it pulls from the one the rocket is attached to
Ultimate boosters much?
/me applauds
Chrysalis, I have already reached solar orbit with ease. I just didnt know how to get the liquid fuel to work right
Will the mods be able to see me ghosting someone?
hey BronyinJapan
00,02there we go
very nice, Sumica
hell yeah now fly it
roman candle there
Simon anyone can see it that uses an external lclient
CupcakeWarrior, you can do better. Do like they do in Fist of the North Star: strike a manly pose as you bawl your eyes out :3
INB4 IT COLLAPSE ON the launch pad
Polydunami: But Ive never seen Fist of the North Star D:
Don't you burn a lot of fuel with that?
wtf Phase4 , so much of that... thing
ooo bright lights
00,10file in skype Phase4
Dis game da fank D:
ok nm
now let it drop like a nuke bomb
Oh. Well, imagination is a good thing ;)
Jim your breaking orbit, your always gonna use loads of fuel
/me shines a flashlight at ImOkayWithThis

/me checks steam
Oh wait, the other kind of ships
I'm bored!!!!!
I'm sleepy.
for people in the chat who liked the last symphonic metal piece I have a few more if you want them
it is a bannible offence to name your rocket certain names, of course. :D
/me pokes Magical_pablez94
hey phase 4 do the same thing again but do it for sumica he wants to see that shit
/me checks it again... da fuq
00,10and make sure you got this song ready http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgskINKZWjY
00,02lets see how this goes
StupidSexyCarambola: what?
00,10full burn on the liqueds
no , you gotta play major tom
Can you reach the sun in .14? I know you can't on 13 - had some strange, strange things happen when I tried
That's one helluva rocket
StupidSexyCarambola: what's up?
Well guys I feel horrible so I'll go visit the land of dreams
anyone want more symphonic metal?
That was a good beat going on...
Magical_pablez94: nothin
Sounds like a vuvuzela
I can orbit the sun, cher3ry
Jim: it's beautiful
never tried to hit it
Orbit is easy.
hehehehehehe your tilting the rocket
night~
Sumica you ever had liquids overheat?
BEHOLD the Sumi rocket able to reach solar orbit... or collapse hilariously on the launch pad
metalzeldapony, you've got Trans-Siberian Orchestra on your mind, haven't you?
I hit it. Or tried to rather
StupidSexyCarambola: okay..... <.< | >.>
Or Nightwish
cause they are supposed to be able to, but i never got them to go
Phase4, y u no turn on stabalizers?
00,02well poo
night everypony im tired and im planning on sleep now
sooo goodnight!
ended up going into negative altitude, with a pseudo-stable orbit _inside_ the sun itself
night Shamroc
00,10oh and make sure you use the rcs to stableise once you get to the last set of solids
night Shamroc
Spectrum_Plush: that wud be quite hilarious
Goodnight Shamroc :)
Gnight, Shamroc. Take care.:)
Night Shamroc :)
nite Shamroc
gnight Shamroc!
hey phase 4 what type of computer do you have?
Polydunami: actually no here's what I was thinking of http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mamDP2oRlw8&feature=plcp\
night large amout of pings
goodnight Shamroc. ;)
Oh yeah
00,10too early for rcs
Shamroc only sees us as pings. ;~;
No videos links during Stream, metalzeldapony
Applejazz: http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/174372
00,02'jebediah kerman
00,02'thts the center guy
Phase4: i love the centerguy
00,02Sumica, stabilizers wern't doing it, turned it on for a bit
CupcakeWarrior: Oh you. :D
WinRARity...
00,10yeahjust let it
Rarity wins.
:3
00,02guy on the right is bob
Hey does everpony know who does te voice foer Derpy Hooves on the youtube accont
00,02left is bill
/me glomps Applejazz
Celestia wins :3
00,10so long as it keeps the nose up, drift is ok
00,02bobs shitting himself
phase 4 i dare you to do a barra roll
/me glomps CupcakeWarrior back
:3
00,02xxMoopyxx,
00,02k
bill bob and 'jebediah... one of these names is not like the others
Inb4 immenant doom.
00,10nah this is a proven insain desgin
barra roll barra roll
dat rotation
that's the slowest barrel roll I've ever seen
spaaaaaaaaaaace
So what's the mission?
weeeeeeeeeeeeee
Polydunami: Luna
Polydunami: Go get Luna on the moon
I love how the one in the middle just doesn't give a buck while the other 2 seem to be just completely terrified XD
Polydunami: rescue woona
dat barra roll.
Is that even a barrel roll?
... I see now.
00,10woona!
yes it is
:D
I never could land on that damn Mun
you can use that little arrow at the bottom of the map screen to access the ball and controls in map mode...
phase 4 do a 90 degree angle
00,02gah
Polydunami: actually no what everyone thinks is a barrel roll is actually calle d a airlion roll my spelling may be of but yea
Rain - got there by accident today... no fuel, in a strange orbit, got yanked in by the Mun
So shall we expect a success?
00,02i cannot figure which way is which
*explodes*
Yeah, it's as I thought.
do it
00,10basicly you lign up the brown V on the ball and hit the sas to stablise it
That's because space has no up or down
I didn't know the actual name for it, Spectrum_Plush
The green circle with three lines at right angles to each other is your "forward"
...But maybe Google does :3
lign it up where, Sumica?
00,10kill the rcs
00,10line it up where you want to go.
"And i think its gonna be a long long time till touchdown brings me back again to find , im not the mare they think i am at home oh no, im a rocketmare....ROCKETMARE burning out her fuse up here alone..."
Polydunami: aileron roll http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/AileronRoll.gif
but how do you know where that is?
like is there a marker for the moon?
Mun*
I just found the article, Spectrum_Plush
there's one at 180 with three lines in a bisected triangle pattern which represents exact opposite.
phase 4 when you get even a bit mre higher let your rocket drop all the way down back to earth
Thanks anyway :3
and the orange with the long flat is what way your nose is pointed
00,10if you are looking at the line between brown and blue you are set for orbit
00,10just need to be going fast enough to hold it
00,10the green ring on the ball are orbital track
get up to apogee, and full burn at 180, you have orbit.
00,02i screwed this up
Oh
00,10the green ring with an x is where you are coming from
00,10the other is where you are going.
Phase4: can i link u a ossim song?
Phase4: so u can play it on stream while ur playing
Ohai Alicorn_Prince_Shane :)
00,02yeah but theres no ring for the moon
kill your thrust
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, sure
Nuts
hey Ponies47 y u no sleep?
Phase4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOUcazXL1w
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: ZIP IT!
Ponies47: tehe dat song is making me happy
00,02whats the pink one
00,10so to slow down you aim the nose at the ring with the x
ok while your on orbit in a few minutes let your rocket drop all the way back down to earth no parra shoots
00,10not sure what pink is yet
SO CLOSE!
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I see.
The pink points at Pinkie Pie
close, and he has lots of fuel to make an attempt.
TO THE MOOOON!
... Just like real life. :|
OY FOCUS ON GAME! :P
flo...rida...
-_-
ikr
/me drools
00,10this is not space music
wut.
Om: its a remix
Where's da moon!?
/me tries to whistle along, nut lacks the ability to whistle :<
Who's streaming?
00,10use the sas to stabelise
00,02i'm near enough
00,02just need to slow
Ponies47: Phase4 is
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I don't know how that changes anything.
00,02plenty of fuel for that i think
Om: just love it for wut it is
^
ok mute time
/me whistles for CupcakeWarrior
lol metalzeldapony
nop
/me can whistle along CupcakeWarrior :S
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: What and he's taking music to play?
wow, I agree with him, for once. Sad day.
aim for the moon so that you get closer
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Alright. I can do that.
/me tackles Applejazz
/me whist;es
/me whistles
Oof.
Autotune is putting me off.
inb4 bass
00,10yeah
right now if you burn you will gain speed not lose it
outer ones are like :oh crap! , mioddle one is like : SPAAAAAAAACCEEEE!
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Is he?
00,10point nose at mun and boost
ilikespace
phase 4 when your done do the starfox style
Ponies47: yes
Jebediah is Luffy.
this song makes me so happy
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: AWW SWEET FREAKIN SWEET *Squees*
sometimes i feel like using paint programs is like draw auto tune
00,02where is it?
00,10look where you are aiming
this song club remixed was playing in the Hummer on the way to my formal
00,10use camera
use your arrow keys to rotate your view
00,02i cant find the moon
Ponies47: with 25 k worth of music equipment in it
00,10keep looking
its got to be close
The moon is hiding
The moon is probably pitch black to you.
Ponies47: when the bass parts happen the seats would buzz
look up and then rotate 360, then lower a bit and rotate
I saw the moon there :P
360
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I see
Phase4: Luna Activated the moons Stealth systems
Think that was the earth, Vordox
00,02XD
Earth is GRAY?
On the dark side, yes
Vordox: it was lawl
Phase4 is best space captain
00,10be systamadic
Back in the 50's it was.
No no no, that's Kearth, and it's BROWN :|
look at pink and see what that is
Phase4: a good song if u want to play is Pinkies lie by wooden toaster if u want if thats alright with u
use your arrow keys to scan the sky in a systematic way.
00,02i dont know what this pink dot lis
00,02is'
00,02lets aim for it
aim at it and look
i think pink dot is pluto
you arent looking!
00,10turn the camera so it looks the way the ship looks
in b4 thud.
00,10turn the bloody camera
pfft autotune?
Phase4: ^
right now you're in a lunar escape path
less then That shit song relating to the day b4 saturday
00,02i dont see the moon
00,10less map more tuning to look
damn phase 4 your really high
May I post a link to fitting music, Phase4 ?
its gotta be above or below, you keep looking left and right
Phase4: ^
Green is Kearth
00,02sure
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJzfOA9uV6E <-- You're going to love this
00,02there it is
lol fianlly
Vordox, absolutely.
Look out Luna, here comes Phase!
pfft FF
ah nice. And your aligned right to slow your relative speed most efficiently
DeeeaaaaaaMooooooooonaaaaahhhh!
May we have the first ever Brony on the moon!?
now land on it and get as much cheese as you can
/me noms TrixieBaconMuffin
except now you're on an earth orbit again somehow
Yum :3
Scoff.
burn straight for mun for a burst or two
Dat steering
Phase4: reach the moon!
00,02i cant turn this damned thing
you need to get into lunar orbit first, then slow so you fall into its gravity well
This is why you have 4 paddles. :P x y z
lol this is funny
/me Will Phase4 be the first of Bronystate to land on the Moon? Tune in next time to Bronystate Z
you need to turn on your "R" and probably toggle off the SRS now
Spin spin spin!
lol
assuming you have any manuvering thrusters on that part of the ship...
Use small burst to stabilize towards the moon
00,10keep your rcs on
00,10you are in space fins are useless
hey phase 4 do a 360 spin
Lawl Sumiva XD
fins. in. space.
00,02Sumica, the thing has gyros
00,02plus very little rcs fuel
the stock gyros, yeah
00,10cause you left it on for most of lift off
fins dont work in space , nowegian space program wins !
00,02the sas is doing bugger all
The music Phase4! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJzfOA9uV6E
because it is the stock sas
srs won't do anything in space without rcs...
wait why is there noise in space?
00,10less type more aim
cher3ry, the gyros do
Sumica is Houston! Oh wait I mean Kerbalouston
... Why are there radio waves in space?
noise is louder in space because theres no air to get in the way
i don't hear anyhting oh thre we go
dat logic xD
woop Final Fantasy
00,10do like 10%
NOW TO AIM!
fiiting
no. no noise in space... except for from the spaceship you're actually on. noise does transmit well through metal.
This is about the time I would expect the spanish inquisition
Lol Om!
TrixieBackonMuffin: ( -_-)*\)
Om: lol what a show
This is fitting because it's going nowhere xD jk
00,10just burn slow and corect on the move
phase 4 can you actually try to fly towards to the moon?
00,10sloww burn
It's feasible
Polydunami: It's SLOWLY going!
This is the closest to the Moon yet!
cause it seems to me it takes a long time to get there
So, if you manage to land, you actually have to have enough fuel to get back, right?
I think he's gonna run out of fuel before he can get the right insertion tho...
Hmm. I dunno. But you are close.
Jim: Feck that, WOONA!
00,02thats it
00,02out of fuel
NOOOOOO
NOoooO!
oh your done for
jim - No. You can't actually land safely on the moon anyway. no air for the chutes
00,02time for re-entry
I keep telling you. You need more rockets.
need a lunar lander, and the game doesn't have one yet.
00,10seprate
^
cher3ry: What if you turn the rocket around and use the boosters to slow your entrance
I saw a video of someone doing that
All dem tabs
00,02oh....
jim - then your rockets explode under you when you hit the ground
00,10yeah
Om: this was Sumi rocket i think its got enough
00,02i've escaped earths gravity
Whoa, that's a lot of Youtube :O
they ded
Spectrum_Plush: Never enough.
yup. solar insertion
this is still alpha ?
your way off track dude
00,10yeah should have seprated from all that dead mass
00,02meh
My song fit the most! :D
00,10bit late now
separate again! :D
dat second naught
Pretty sure his chute won't help him now.
Close though Phase4 SO Close!
There are never enough rockets, as demonstrated by this photo. http://derpy.me/fmdxn
oh phase 4 put on that remix song called windows techno remix
wait, the RCS can boost in one direction? :O
00,10yes
00,10break or bost
thats now
00,10nah
00,02hmmm
needs story mode , make successful space flight , aquire shuttle , built space station , go to moon , build orbital lift , ....
00,02i'ma try something else
new*
00,10it's just not listed
how do you do it?

hey phase 4 do it for me show me what you got
Om: I'm not sure what to think with that one.....
xD
you left part of your ship on the pad there... lol

and no one died
What a flash diet
00,02space acrobatics!
do a barrel roll!
00,02back to srs space
That should totally be a sport
00,10try the smaller tanks
noo, when in doubt go bigger
00,10bigger tanks are just heavyer
why not a mixture of both
00,10for what he is doing go lighter, he dont need to reach space
00,10same thrust less dead weight
...that made me check my skype :P
^
ohh hes just doing stunts
yeah smaller then
with loads of fuel tanks
solid*
phase 4 do the starfox style of the rocket

Im Loving this music!! Helps me get my drawing done :) been working on the stupid thing for weeks now =_(\
RaveBrony: doesnt he like pony music :'(
ninja_pony: Im sure he does, buuut, his stream, his likes :P

mood dependent I guess
wrek has rainbowdash skin?

well im going to bail have a good night everypony :)
:P
Cya ninja_pony!
spychicken!

I can see why people play this game, but i dont see how they can play for so long O.o

one must not fine oneself in one's pennis
O_o
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Wrek is :P
Dat... castle.. o.o
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: you talking about the stream or about us?
hard to believe that tower hasn't hit the clouds just yet
RaveBrony: k
diddutz: stream
Holy sheeeyut, dat block thingy :o
Sundaysmile, there are no details in minecraft :D
LIES
5 random ponies
and then some admin made it rain creepers
05the guitarrsolo at the end of this song is orgasmic
or spawn an ender dragon
sounds like dire straits
Well, all the good discounts on that game that will not be mentioned have expired.
dat 8 bit moon luna's getting old school in MC
I hope the rumours of being able to make Ender Dragon statue parts is true
would be an epic addition to a castle turret
whats a "ender dragon"?
big assed dragon
Dragon that ends the game if you kill it
so is this just a random awesome castle _ or one we might know _
whatever it touches, is destroyed
oh i just thought you spell elder dragon wrong :D
05this is the solo im talkign about
big ass castle.....but with no funiture?
interior decoration always comes last
no point filling the interiors if you have to remodel the entire structure
build a Bath tub
The beacons of gondor have been lit!!
just end up doing more work
build a golden bathtub
Back
Welcome back Jim!
hey Jimbo
MOIST TOWELETTES
dishwasher_EXTREME: Where, where?!
LoyalDash on my ass
who's crafting their mine? :3c
Wrek
dishwasher_EXTREME: Uhhh, okay.
Minecraft in swedish :p
LoyalDash they feel......
minecraft in swedish is exactly the same as minecraft in english or german >_>
LoyalDash GLORIOUS !!!!
dishwasher_EXTREME: Umm, good to know.:D
Rain: It does have some text when you hover the mouse over items
That text is translated
and yet its the same game
Fortrollingsbord!!!
Oh, I always thought Wrek was German.
no, VioletVanilla is the german one :3
Oh, okay. My mistake.
What a nice use of half blocks
half blocks are also great for making reinforced windows :)
creepers can go take a hike :3
Is this pre-recorded or just now happening
it's happening about half minute before you see it
dat zombie
good god, Wrek. you've been busy :3
must have taken a while eh?
Oh, I didn't expect there to be monsters on this server.
animal spawns can still happen on servers with no monsters
is that build in place on generated village?
05nope
either that or they spawned em
RAIBOWS
Nice Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy.
You really HAVE been busy
which minecraft version is that?
05latest
how'd you get such a large snow biome?
05luck, its the seed
shame... woulda liked something similar for my own
hehe gamer poop fuck up my mine
05for the young people in here
05that buildign is a replica of the WC2 barracks
Awesome
:o
how long did that take to get done thus far?
this is already beyond awesome
05adn the castle is a representation of the keep, same game
infinity and beyond !!!!!
I see. You're doing a good job on that keep.
SPACE
Some guys are in my room, taking out my window
Jim why/
Because it needs to be swapped
what's the silver thing to the right?
Wrek: is this mp server?
we need a Bstate mc server
I think bronystate had one O.o
Needs to be a PvP server where you invade the village
There used to be one, but it wasn't open that often
poor creeper
trolols
So, are Creepers non-agressive in this kind of server?
all the mobs are non aggressive
They are not agressive when you are in Creative mode
Okay.
people are starting to arrive here at work - see everypony later...
cya
Cya User0
05one hell of a snow biome
/me is eating a klondike bar
it's a gorgeous view
just seeing how far it goes?
/me takes rdibp s bar
05y
/me throws it back to rdibp
its double chocolate :)
What would you do for a klondike bar?
Id eat a klondike bar
and I'll bet right next to the snow is a scorching desert...
Snowy area is snowy
And it changed
Wow, that was rather large
swamp
actually snow is still there
Well, that was a great plot of snow. Too big for any sort of Winter Wrap Up
He should bring out a map
plot of snow?
and chart the area
giggidy
an ass of snow....frosty the snowman fetish?
snowpony?
and then Wrek was lost...
Er... sorry
MORE SNOW :$:$:$
Night All :D :P $ :)
there should really be an applejack emote
It just became morning but, night
is view distance set to far already?
Looks like far, yes

Oh. Because you said you were going to get one.
03I have come to the conclusion that "sleep aids" are complete BS
I'm getting 425ish or so for the month of work
03because eveyr time I use them
03it has the reverse effect
03and I CAN'T sleep
03>_>
03<_<
13melatonin ish awesome dud
13trippin..
Unless there were people who were enjoying the nature hikes. Sorry
13i mean, going to sleep is easy
03uh
03what is it with you and melatonon
03*in
03also
03I can't take pills
03:P
Stream ponies. It's 6:00 am in teh west coast. Time for teh morning dosage.
13Melatonin is a Body-own thing that makes you sleep, it can help you with your sleeping problems
13and arent pills, doesnt even have taste
03how else would you take it then
03if it's not a pill
05implying i would ever cater to the west coast
13Powder?
03oh
03well
03this stuff I tried might have that
bacck
03it's called Dream Water, it's like one of those energy shots but is supposed to have the reverse effect and help you sleep

no
you snort it.

do you see it there, Xeli?
8:16 A.M on my end...why the heck is it so quiet? :O
nope
http://i.imgur.com/CIr19.png
flutter_spin: Omg o.o
10I was gonna say maybe it's just an admin/mod thing but Espeon is mod so wat
thats awesome! :D
totally ^^
I dunno, Wrek just finished streaming Minecraft
10Espeon, do you have access to admin config and such?
03inb4 I can't get no respect
30 seconds in and I'm like "Holy crap that's Bowser... and that's holy crap!"
the features and options and such yeah.
Yeah!! :FD
*:D
I did the same!
but a respect system only for admins and mods would make amounts of sense that's below zero
10and the staff board?
ello everypony
yes
10k
Xeli, change theeeeme
nah
boobs
well
:) Sylandest how are you?
I'm sure everyone around here has some sort of hate attributed to them
atm a couple of people are REALLY pissed at me
nope, never ever changed theme for more than a few minutes because I go ARGH THIS IS NOT WHAT I WAS USED TO
hi
lmfao
wait why are there 2 Ninjazz ?
Ho-Oh <3
and that's why rep/respect/upvote doesn't work
03yeah, I didn't change the theme either
there's no "opinions" filter
03default theme ftw
good just trying to find out any info i can on this derpy doll i payed for
10I use Ho-Oh because it's the darkest colour, a bit more than Shadow Lugia
I don't like the Shadow Lugia theme
chats really quiet tonight....
10I hate bright colours
10especially on a laptop screen
10burns my eyes
I don't mind bright colours that much
http://item.fromtaobao.com/item.htm?id=15765107705&spm=2014.12003210.0.0 <-- starting to think i payed for something that is sold out
Heh
03I hate "colours" at all
03:D
Altair's theme is still the best
03also, lrn2contrast settings
That theme is god damned awesome <3
03black text on white ftw
The background makes it even better
03it's actually worse on CRTs than LCDs.
white text on black
10White text on black FTW
03but yet you prefer the REVERSE on the forum?
03er
03wait nvm
03I misread that
only completely white "burns my eyes" and only when like, in the middle of the night. when it suddenly appears.
lalala.......
03^
03what actually hurts more
10White on black stripes or black on white stripes etc.
and yet I use black text on white bg for irc
hue
03is switching back and forth
03like those websites that have white on black
03and then I have googlke
03*google
03XD
Sylandest: Stop being suspicious.
03it's like OW STOP DOING THIS TO ME
lalala
0,1DERP
03I'd prefer to just
03keep everything white background
03or light colored
also 8,9hurr durr
03you know what makes me laugh a little
03and is more proof that Sony is an idiotic company
hey XAX
03their laptops, have this wallpaper called "low battery use" that's all white instead of darker colored
._. hai dishwasher_EXTREME
03>implying that matters at all
people buy sony laptops?
03apparently
03I mean
Anyway
03look at everybody in Sony movies
/me runs
I promised myself I'd go to sleep early tonight
it's almost 11:30pm
which is somewhat early
03but fine
so goodnight
03go
/me runs
I love you too
Ninjazz2: ill stop being suspicious when I can form the thought to not be suspicious :P
03LOL
tranvesti exacutive
Sylandest: There is nothing to be suspicious about. O__O
bye-face
10:P
03if we end up actually using that
Ninjazz2: but you said I was suspicious? :S
someone should make a thread about the rep thing to determine if it's just you girls going crazy or what
Sylandest: I didn't say that... Ninjazz did. O__O
03see also: the new Google design
welp im bored, bye ppl i dont know
both of you are suspicious especially you Ninjazz2
03a few people got it first, started freaking out, nobody else knew what they were talking about

/me thinks that his permanent name-extension might be inducing bad puns.
He's..a bear
:D
08,01okay, would you like to see somethign amazing?
as long as you dont make any sudden moves that bear shouldnt be interfering with you finding something
Is it... MY HORSE?!
No. I'm the bear. I'm a buddy bear because I'm supposed to always get along with everyone and never disagree again.
ok... I really like Demo Scene demos
no , please show a dull grey wall for 3 hours straight
O.o
show a jar of mayonaise for 10 straight minutes
The Buffer Show! <3
Traxi: and then pinkie pie will crash through it?
08,01so yeah, this whole thing was generated from 4k of executable code
oops
i HATE TAB
look at dat thing go
08,01none of the scenery is texture-mapped
I haven't seen much demoscene, but I'm pretty cool with what I've seen of it.
08,01it's all just done using shaders
round and round andournd it goes... when will it stop?? Only the Mods know!! :$
whos clopping
Hi
o.o
08,01all the camera movement is also done using shaders, as the way it works, only the GPU knows about the surface geometry

Demoception
Getting slight audio lag
yeah, just a tad though
Not sure if it's just on my side
08,01so yeah, all the geometry, all the "texturing", all the music, all the camera movement and effect, all that fit inside a 4k executable
the scrolling is lagging
and choppy vid, though slightly so
so do you guys want to know how I rated Canterlot Dining establishments?
who what where?
This is indistinguishable from live photography. And it's all procedurally generated from a 4k executable? This is astounding.
08,01lag should be cone now
hey Sundaysmile, you do know that its monday right?
I <3 demo scenes , ALL of them... C64, Amiga and These Assembly ones

Scoltish
Lil_B: It's a hard rock/heavy metal festival originally called "Monsters of Rock".
08,01pony_2949: true, but that'd cost me money

08,01and is pretty maxed out
08,01i don't want to put any more load onto it
Knightmare frames are awesome. Specifically, the ejection.

Dermathil: I know, but calling people by numbers is stupid :D
CrazyCherry: ha!
Gildash did metalica
MadSurge: it robs them from their identity, though.
actually in this series.... no
Sylandest: What?
Did metalica play?
Dermathil: just call them pigs or badgers, I dunno :D
Le Louffe?
EggWhite: Yes I did. ;)
GilDash: You wish. :D

GilDash: I hear they are. :$
Lil_B: it's grey morale vs gray morale :D
All I know is I have a rifle and it ain't for looks.
Ninjazz: I've got a recording of Enter Sandman on my phone. If I ever manage to figure our how to upload it, I will. :D
LOL THEY ALL DED

grb.mtrntr4glktrkl
GilDash: download?
he is like Twilight not saying shit about having a brother
Gildash I will but I live in Cornwall and train tickets are expensive, from what I've heard, and I don't have much money so unless the come down to Cornwall (very unlikley :D) I will not be able to see them for awhile.
Didn't someone make an MLP parody of this ending?
don't worry we actually get backstory
C.C.
i feel like no one ever talks to me
o_o
Though I wonder if I should call it a parody...parody sounds a lot like a comedy
Is anyone listening to me?
DUNE!
panda: ... Go and Google Download 2012 festival.
also, DOLLHOUSE
is Dune considered a trilogy?
Guess not.
This is annoying
Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune?
you are a ------ who likes MMMMMMMMMMM bannanas?
Maybe my chat derped and I don't even know it.
:P
Because people are still talking
And HI :)
WindWhistler a parody doesn't need to brbe comedy. look up the definition ^^
I should've recognized the interface sooner...
Invi: Oh, I know that. But whenever I hear parody, that's what I thik of.
GilDash: OH! I SEE!
think*
lol
:D
Shoo bee doo
So I wonder if other people would think that too
You know what I mean, Invi?
the Seaponies are Equestria's NAvy
WorldTraveler: D: no
yes
no
WindWhistler yes. that is the modern understanding of parody because most of them are comedy
the Wonderbolts = Air force
so Seaponies = Navy
LOL... lookm ath these Ponys :D
WorldTraveler: but... the sea ponies help everyone.... they could help the enemy!
Do you like mmmmmmm bannanas?
Royal Guard = Army

Om: ... Get out.
alexxm just got my new order from welovefine so it's been good, and yours ?
Already lost it a long time ago.
Was rewatching footage of the Microsoft E3 conference. At this one point a gal comes on stage to talk about a game....and she has this tattoo on her arm, I couldn't tell what it was at first.
It was G1 MLP. xD
the BB + Battalion back up is a win combo.
GilDash: You must have lost your spark in that week away/
i've been good TheGreatAndPowerfulT what did you order
My day has been great. I was just watching the Ballad of the Brony for the first time.

08,01User0: i have a glow in the dark twilight blindbag guarding my books ^.^
so what have you been up to today Ider0
10Hii
12XD
03hi
03also LOL
03hey, it's not my fault people hate me
I WANT A TWI BACKPACK!
Ninjazz: Oh right, that was panda. Well don't expect much from me.
Good evening everypony.
12No, you didnt even read my post
12and then you replied ovb0
Om: Well, I'm the one who's all snuggly, so I'll deal with it. You get to share in my snugglyness. :)
12*ov0
03I did
03but
Hi Malavolent
Om: Noted. :D
03I have first hand experience LOL
8,6I wish they'd drop more blindbag runs in the US
they say people with autism watching my little pony want every thing they sell of it
12If you'd read my post
/me 08,01looks at his books
hey Malavolent hows your day been
03you say one unpopular thing and get like 20 people giving you bad rep
kirzstryfe: i know right?
panda: then get one :D
12you'd have known that you can';t get negative respect
03and nobody cares to give anybody good rep
03wait
08,01most of them are sci-fi
12I said it doesn't go down
05:O*
Airpuff: :(
12At all
panda: what? :s
User0: If its your money, spend it how you wish
xD
8,6the 26 sitting on my shelf need more friends :3
ohai Malavolent
08,01but a lot are about computing
12So thanks..
alexxm: Okay, how about you?
i don't think its true because i have autism
Airpuff: they dont have them here :(
GilDash: Why don't you share it with CrazyCherry or something. They would love it.
panda: order one?
08,01hey, would any of you like a book abotu networking?
08,01i don't need it anymore
10Articuno, did you see my topic about IPs? It was from a couples days ago, I wanted to make the staff aware of it :3
kirzstryfe: Got any pics of them all?
User0 i have a rainbow dash and applejack brushies on my desk
I am so jelly of your ponies, I have none
12I hate to say this but I can totally see why people rated your posts down if they were like that
08,01actually
Airpuff: :( but... i dont buy online XD
My other problem is that I can't order stuff online since my parents check my credit card statements (mostly for accuracy and fraud, but I can't freely use it)
03oh
03well
i'm good Malavolent
03I read stuff like
03"Don't worry, you can generally tell if someone's being like that by the number of other ratings. If theres 10 high ratings and 1 low, it's obvious what's going on :3 if there's 10 low ratings and one high, again it's pretty obvious. Few ratings should be opinionated to be honest but it's useful for the debate board to know who's opinion is most agreed with and who's isn't."
08,01i'll have a clear out of my books later
03I saw "low ratingS"
Om: I'm too tried to make moves. I know you wouldn't dare. :)
alexxm: from McD?
03and assumed bad rep
03:P
I don't have any either :'(
12I don't think so Skylands, one sec
08,01anyone who wants to claim some of them is welcome to
panda: Omg..
08,01so long as you're in the UK
10It is stickied
sagas: I wish, but college is expensive too
Airpuff: omg what?
12Yeh but my FiRST post DRF
panda: thats the reason? :D
8,6somewhere, let me see if I can dig it up
12Clearly stated that it does NOT go down
GilDash: Fair enough.
03I saw tl;dr
User0 no england hasen't done the mlp happy meals yet
Airpuff: yesh XD well not yet... anyways
03you do the same to me LOL
panda: why dontcha buy online.. ONCE? :$
12OMG
do somebody knows a joke?
03regardless, I hate forum rep systems
The only pony I have is a McDonalds Celestia I took from my 3 year old sister (left it under the couch=mine).
12Not with important stuff where I am actually going to make a reply about it XD
XD
Airpuff: well... at the time being, my account is over drafted... so... doing so will overdraft more...
08,01sagas: shipping would be cheaper than buying some of these books
12Well this one works differently :3
i jump down and tf2 crashes
Om: Although if you want to make some, I wouldn't mind. ;)
03because it turns everything into a competition
Broccoli_Pony: That'll show her!
03who can get the most rep
03on stuff
Broccoli_Pony: Nice logic :D
alexxm: oh, well, I got 3 McD toys, but I don't know where they got to (my mom helped me pack up my college dorm, and I haven't found them yet... but there are a lot of unopened boxes still)
GilDash x Om now cannon :D
panda: aaahh... i see... thats not to cool.
Airpuff: yeah >.>
Yep.
03People are competitive by nature, introduce anything like that and it turns into a competition :|
08,01i have a book on coding theory and information theory that i paid £150 for
08,01heh, obviously, i'm not giving that one away
12If that happens, certian people are to blame and will have cost us a good feature.
panda: I'll ship you with a peanut, you two would be the best pair.
that was painful , im now bleeding from several deep cuts , also internet explorer is garbage , problem still there
that's one expensive book
Om: but i would be too smart for her!
Om: :D
GilDash: Well see gillysuit
03isn't that why you're having a vote to beginw tih?
panda: Isn't GilDash already shipping (hope the notify works :( )
12They are well aware of this, everyone has the power to mess this up
03I already said why I don't like it :P
08,01it's a tiny book too
panda: Doubtful.
08,01but it's very, very good
panda, its just now canon?
Om: :( meanie!
Om: you have turned quite much though... :$
So they take extra paid for quality?
Broccoli_Pony: Yep. My attention is now on you. Good luck. ;)
12I am just telling you that half of your reason for not liking it was wrong!
Airpuff: What do you mean?
WallDives: well.. they both are in the closet together, this is the furthest ive seen their budding relationship
Om: I'm just glad you haven't smacked me yet. :D
panda: I don't like bein shiped.
03fine
03but my other half is legit
07MRS BURD.
Om: well.. you've changed from the first day you joined.. alt! :D
I have no idea how this chat even works besides emoticons and typing....
Sky should watch F-Men and Steward Wittle
12Yeh, but that's why we're testing it D:
dis song is good
Om: you havent been shipped, refer to it as "hooking up"
GilDash: Why would I do that?
12Hey Kyu :3
panda: How could a brony be...mean!?!?!
User0 did you hear about andrew w.k being a brony
12http://www.lugia.co.uk/forum/help-and-feedback/post-rating-system!-v/
12Here what do you think of this?
/me breeeeeees
Airpuff: That happens
|Discord|: idk ask Om
alexxm: Indeed I did
03Having it where nobody else can see your rep might be one thing
08,01Stallion_of_War: non-existent
Om: .. yeah... still you're turning.. to the other side.
08,01we use pounds
panda: Even worse.
12By the way, forgot to say - the post rating stays no matter what, it is the rep we are having a vote on
Om: nope ^^
Oh, I might have the opportunity to get another t-shirt or something today when I swing by Hot Topic - I'll already be at the mall for dinner...
Airpuff: I'm on my own side.
Airpuff: otherside? om is on myside :D
12Sadly the only option is Display or Not Display XD
03o.o
Om: ... sure you are.. :D
03well what they did on Digital Video Forums, initially they just made the reps private
<3 this song
Stallion_of_War it is but we don't use euros
03and then got rid of them entirely a few months later
who wants to join me in a shooting game?
Airpuff: I am :(
03but yay phpBB
03I fricking love that thing
omg 23 was the lucky number , refreshed again and now i got mips
Om: Well, somedays I really think you don't like me...
12Omg thats the worst forum ever
No pony loves meee :(
/me sulks
8,6lol
03at least it works
03:P
/me hugs GilDash
Ew :P
GilDash: Everyone thinks that, totaly natural.
03I don't think I've seen any of the phpBB forums I frequent ever have database errors like yours does
and i see a stream
Om: Good job I know better then. :)
panda: Hipocrit.
GilDash: thats just Om ... :D
03oh, and they're set up so you can't change your username, instant plus right there
GilDash: yeah... while you were gone for that week, Om has been hating me :(
/me runs
8,6yeah, sometimes with that message it's a browser issue, sometimes an isp issue, sometimes a wtf issue
/me hugs sagas.
12Database errors???
thanks for being there in my time of need
8,6:3
12ov0 when does it have database errors?
/me is happy
12You mean Php errors?
Om: how am i a hippo chryte?
Oh right I forgot ponys can't tell if i am joking over the net thanks for the hugs through :)
panda: :D heæs been all over ya
12That's because I am physiocally going in and breaking the code XD
03you know, the reason you kept refusing the hosts I showed you?
03because they suck at databases
03and so on
Airpuff: XD
he's*
*hug*
03and it would give random errors that it can't connet
03*connect
panda: You. Should just get back to your peanut...
12DRF stop, you know nothing XD also I was using Phpbb back then :3
12So there
Om: but you are my penut
GilDash: you should've seen him.. he's like a beast against panda
I really wish I could be joining in the TF2 fun right now...
Flamed hurrr
right Om ? :D
03uh
Gil better be a mare.
GilDash: Om made me cry :(
03no you weren't LOL
User0: Why cant you?
:P
Airpuff: I wish Om were a little beastly with me. ;)
What chat commands are there?
12Yes I was
e_o
03wasn't it the same forum system the entire time it was lugia.us?
8,6sorry nobody responded before if you were trying to get them, prince-lemon is usually afk, and I know Shizuka is still asleep
sagas: I'm at work right now
/me hugs panda
12Yes, but before that, I was using Phpbb.
GilDash: I guess you did :D
03I'm talking about lugia.us
He is a mare?
03it worked a lot better before that
sagas: omg you hugged me! my life is somplete!
panda what did he do *hugs*
03just saying
you can type /nick newnickhere for a new nick and /me and some text for an emote
/me confus

12and seriously, stop, you have no idea what you're saying :/
sagas: coffee cup on my left, RD between my monitors, notepad on my right, brony wristband on and everything
User0: Oh but you allowed to do this?
/me hugs sagas
/me something something
8,6my blindbags http://i.imgur.com/kSIh7.jpg?1
alexxm: he was just mean
03so using other sites and comparing them is irrelevant?
Whoa, that's one huge Luna
kirzstryfe: :O
/me is confused but delighted.
panda: glad i could be of service
sagas: It is lunch-o-clock for me
12Yep
12Because
kirzstryfe: im jelly!
03remember I sent you that video of how it takes stupidly long to login to TST compared to like everything else in existance
Something happened... And I don't know what. But it was bad.
12It was nothing to do with the software
03I'm not claiming to know about the coding, I'm just saying as an end user, phpBB is awesome
8,6the Luna was a birthday gift a friend has custom made for me ^_^
sagas: and normally, I'm on irc - just, less active channels
kirzstryfe: how do you get a blind bag?
that celestia is huge, kirzstryfe!
kirzstryfe: give me your spare flutterguy
sagas: luna
Om: Maybe we should go and investigate? :S
oh
greedy kirz leave some ponies for other people too
What? Scoot-Scootaloo is taken -_-
look similar
I don't play TF2, and have to ask a question: How does a spy deceive you more than once if you can see their username?
03it gave errors, so
Om: what happened?
03what caused them I dunno
8,6I think I have 3-4 of the Fluttershy blindbags
07hurr
12you're saying I have errors because of the type of forum I used..
GilDash: Look in a mirror, that would be a good place to start.
i haz only one blindbag
12if you dunno, then don't say it :3
How do I... What do I... *sigh*
07ratings should be interesting
I has 0 blindbags...
Airpuff: Way to many people talk to me.
8,6panda, depends on where you are and whether the stores stock them in your area
Om: oh...
You need to do RD hair, kir
kirzstryfe how much are blindbags normally
kirzstryfe: well... sandiego california ? :D
03inb4 everybody goes and down-rates everything I ever posted :|
You need to do RD hair, kirzstryfe
07and I don't really see much potential for abuse
No custom Derpy? kirzstryfe I am disappoint
When they use disguise they look like a team mate even close up. and invis you can't see them upclose.
I'm making over a hundred bucks a day working, but I have little amounts of pony swag...
panda: wasnt it you who didnt buy on the net?! :D
8,6walmart runs ~$2, toys-r-us ~$2.50
07you just distrust everyone that much
07|D
12So what? it has no effect on your profile Xd
kirzstryfe: oh shit!
12*XD
thanks kirzstryfe
Airpuff: no i was asking for in store :D
03Kyubree this is coming from back when I was a forum noob
panda: oh :D
03and I'd ask questions
03people kept down-voting them because they thought it was common sense
Om: Omffee. It's my first day back. Play nice. :)
03and I ended up with like, the worst rep on the forum LOL
8,6I'm hoping to grab one of the comic con derpys from one of the vendors that also comes to megacon
panda: would be fun to see ya.. suddenly a random guy comes running into a toy-store and buys a bunch of ponies :D
11.•10«11WB10 (Aurora10) 11WB10»11•. 10- MY MILKSHAKES BRING ALL THE B-
02*WB03(Aurora03)02WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
Airpuff: :D omg they have them at the wallmart down the street from me
12Are you sure you asked questions and not just said stupid things without reading the first post? LOL
panda: ahaha lucky :P
07XD
03um
03if my post was the first post
03then yes.
GilDash: Right. Since you just got back from having all sorts of fun. I would give you a break.
Airpuff: yeah... especially cuz im handsome and tall ^^
Airpuff: JK!
panda: ahahaha
03I'd make threads asking how to do stuff
8,6if you know what you're watching for, you can see the shimmer of an invis spy
12Ok but you don't do that here
Om: I'm glad you're so understanding. :)
03and since everybody there is an expert, they thought they were trivial questions
03:P
panda: whatever you say panda, whatever you say :P
Oh, alright. I understand that.
03No I know
Hey everypony
03but other people do
12So you have nothing to worry about unless you say something stupid XD
03well
Airpuff: XD
03don't you consider everything I say stupid :D
Got 2 cans of Red Bull :)
Scoots are better at stealth though.
GilDash: That was also a joke. Heavy, heavy, sarcasm.
12Yeh but we actually help them here
omnomnom
hello Very_Silly_Filly! Missed you!
panda: im a 10 feet tall purple guy with a massive yellow fro.
Very_Silly_Filly: free red bull at my workplace~
Om: I plough through sarcasm. British, remember? :)
:D
03well I was joking around anyway
12Sorry but that's all :3
kirzstryfe: What is that demon-looking head and hand?
03since you used to call me a n00b atll the time
13it's caused by your browser not sending the referrer header, which is usually caused by something like noscript
03*all
02*WB03(MysticLugia03)02WB* - <MysticLugia> 12And even with help, I am yet not able to get that what I want
12You are one :O
British destroy sarcasm like they do....other things
SPY
03exactly
12lol
07lol
GilDash: That means as much to me, as telling you I'm a bozemanite.
Very_Silly_Filly at least we never destory allied stuff
Airpuff: im getting 600 in the mail... how many ponies will that buy if I bought them at 4 bucks each
12But seriously, have you ever seen any rude/sharp responses to newbies asking questions here?
8,6dragon in an egg, found it at an art show
/me kisses Om.
nice
03I usually just ignore that type of thread all together, admittedly
-_-
12On the forum, not the chat like the way you reply XD
Chrysalis: ...Shaddap
:c
Om: It means I'm going to ignore it and I'm going to love you anyway. :)
12Ok :3
panda: omfg.. D:
:D
03because hey
14stop crashing X___X
GilDash: Swell.
03"if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all"
Airpuff: should i spend the whole school check on ponies?
Dont act like you didnt enjoy it Om
14hi again btw
07hurr, I was thinking that same thing Arti
03on chat sometimes I go overboard since I'm bored
Reading the FAQ... How did Epic Movie get the worst movie clause? I liked it.
03but yeah
07|D
8,6or that >.>
panda: like 150 of them :D
Then, I'm a pretty good shot actually
Om i'd take sagas advice
Airpuff: :D
sagas: That's easy enough. I don't.
03right, hence why I said it would be surprising for me to be in defense of new users
Om: There you go then. :)
03:P
I've had a bit of practise with sidearms
12XD
panda: totally worth it.. as you bathe in ponies :D
03I'm not as stupid as people make me out to be
03only just a little
Airpuff: brb... gotta run to the store for more tea and stamps :D
Om: why not?
panda: more tea?!
You drunk one already? panda ?
8,6this is all I do anyways: http://xkcd.com/627/
Airpuff: yeah! i drink alot!
Jeezus :D
panda: Don't have any fun at all.
panda: .. man..
Om: i wont ^^
sagas: Because.
panda: thats alot :D
Airpuff: waht? i know right?
I've already destroyed one of my cans
Om: go on...
Now for the other
panda: i drink alot myself.. but... that... :$
sagas: I won't explain anything to you.
oh my
12I don't think you're stupid :> just ignorant at times
2fort
sigh
Soldier is longrange taky dmg dealer rockets break formations and good at destorying engi nests
:D
what did I walk into
07you don't go overboard when you're bored, you were just never on the board to go over in the first place
panda|scavenging: enojy the scate then.
/me runs!

:D
Very_Silly_Filly: I get free red bulls and there is a Keurig machine in the office (free too)
Om: Oh your insecure. Thats cool
Airpuff: i will :D omg... i tried doing a trey flip and failed :(
GilDash: By the way, you missed me on caffinee. Not fun for me.
User0: 1. Mejelly, you bastard. Those RB cans are SO expensive, but so nice
03LOL
And 2, why?
03I admit, that was clever
sagas: Very. that and I don't know you.
panda|scavenging: :'( try again you might get it right? :P
12.....I passed history test, and told my mum about the geography fai, which I could still correct....
12LOL
Very_Silly_Filly: My job is kinda awesome like that
Wow that scout was terrible
03also you walked into Arti and I joking around, no need to worry :P
Airpuff: look up what a 360 flip is and you tell me if ill ever get it right XD
Om: According to you, nothing's fun. You really need to loosen up a little.
12Lol I never took history, I only took Geog
Om: okay then. i can respect that
03history is more interesting IMO
Very_Silly_Filly: in addition, there are all kind of snacks and food - I don't even need to prepare lunches in the morning
6hard to tell
07lol
GilDash: I have.
03especially war history
panda|scavenging: One does not simply claim that practice dosent make master! :D
6at times
12Eww history!
12she switched off internet and say that she´ll unregister it on first
14let's not talk about school x_x I might have failed the year
6anyways
14well, I might on September
12Geography for the win XD
I don't
03people might think I'm sadistic for liking to study wards
sagas: You'd be the first.
03*wars
12Omg EW WAR D:
07we have to learn both history and geography
/me me stops the spider
10I like both history and geography
User0: That''s one reason I'd love to work at either a chippie or a burger king
12LOL wards
03but it's actually really interesting
03well
:D
Om: I've got a toy that could help further. ;)
oh sorry had to make sauce
03I agree, I hate war
historyyyyy
03but studying WHY they happen
Just take a meal home after the shift
12That was an appropriate typo
03is actually kinda interesting
well its working now
07and now we know all the states and all the wars that the US was involved in
03like how WWI was started just because someone backed into the wrong driveway :P
07and that's it
07|D
Very_Silly_Filly: I write code all day~ that's why I'm able to be online
Why do I feel like I'm the only one on P+ in here?
/me gives Om a sneaky hu "still gonna give you a hug though"
GilDash: That, scares me.
/me gives Kyubree a carrot
Atm, my Career chase is coding myself
sagas: -_-
/me bree.
12>v>
8,6:)
03oh also, my history teacher in high school had a Darth Vader mask on his desk. Your argument is invalid
12meh, I can´t bear to life without my pals outside the internet, as well as my mate.....
12Who's stolen Xai's name?
Om: ha just messing with ya
I'm trying to learn C++
03wait, stolen?
6kyu didn't you have to learn all the presidents?
12if my mum decides to turn off internet forever
12Lucario is Xai's name..
Very_Silly_Filly: funniest part, I'm a computer engineering major...
03oh
12He uses it at work..
... that awkward moment when your puppy steals your slippers :(
6rukario is umbreon
03that would be Umbreon
I have some books on C and C+
D:
Very_Silly_Filly: I took a class in C++ last semester
03since he can't pick a name and has like 27 of them
03:P
12:/
But none on C++
sagas: That's fine. I mess with enough people, I should expect some back.
14o.o
GilDash: That, terifies me.
12Ok, we need to stop this dropping of nicks after so long
/me chases after Airpuff slipper
03well
03if people don't ever use them
aw what?
07uh
Om: Holy crap, dude. How are you still typing this much?! :O
6xai does
6he's just not here lol
03when's the last time Xai has used IRC
03like two years ago?
12Xai has a script that alternates between Lucario and Xai, but he only gets on at work every so often...
6all the time
07I don't remember learning all the presidents |D
Ninjazz: Practive.
Airpuff: If I was you, I'd of gibbed your pet from bullets by now
12No more like a few months ago :/
14I don't see Xai here since...December? xP
6kyu alright, I know some schools did
i have never seen Xai
*practice
dammit no matter what games I install, I abandon them after 1-2 days... need something to make me relax when not studying...
03^
12and apparently that's too long to keep a name now...
Very_Silly_Filly: :D
in years
6mine did only as an option back in like 4th grade
03last time I saw him was like a year atgo
03*ago
oh hello Ninjazz. didnt see you there
Om: I never said I'd use it on you, silly. :p
Om: Practice* :3
03well
hmmm
Hey there, sagas. :)
6whoever could memorize them, they got a king size candy bar
03I was referring more to the whole thing where Xanbreon registered the nick Lugia
Ninjazz: See *
07didn't it go down from 180 days to 90 or something
6which, in 4th grade, was the best dam present you could get
03Lugia hasn't used IRC in ages either so it seems fair
12Yeh by the way we're not happy about that
GilDash: .. what.. toy...
12Lugia didn't use IRC because I wasn't using it
:D
GilDash: Then why are you telling me about it e_e
03I had nothing to do with that, don't look at me
Om: Sea*
last time I saw Xai i was i thing 15
Airpuff: That would be telling. ;)
12and he was planning to use it now because we need to work on TST....
Ninjazz: :D
03I'm just saying I can see *why* it does that
*think
Dam you :D
D:
Ballad of the Brony is my new video for my parents, friends, girlfriend, and random haters.
12Yeh well it's an option that can be changed and it needs changing
6ok seriously this is a stupid and pointless argument
03remember when gen 5 came out and everybody was registering random Pokémon nicknames for lulz?
03That's precicely why names expire :P
ha
14o.o
Saberspark is quite the cool guy
6except I actually use "reshiram" still lol
12Yeh but that's also why we have server admins
03I know
Broccoli_Pony: I just swag, problem solved
Om: I don't know... I guess I just feel like being in a sharing mood...
Broccoli_Pony: :D
03you're like the only one
GilDash only few wouldn't get what your talking about :$
03most of the other ones just dropped off
:3
mmm
but it's quite long though, don't you have anything shorter?
Currently arsing around on OoT 3D
12There is such a thing as asking the server admin if they could have the name??
GilDash: Uh huh... Yeah...
User0: you still must buy me pony swag.
we can't ask if they are never online
03^
03no
07actually
Broccoli_Pony: do you have a printer?
03Xai is never online
03is what he means
Om: Hey. I'm allowed to be sappy too sometimes. :(
Yes.
07I still have pidove
07|D
03LOL
hello Broccoli_Pony, you are delicious
07it's been like
03so it obviously lasts longer than we thought
6ok again
07a month
what
12Yeh I said server admin, not the user
Broccoli_Pony: then you have everything you need
eh?
07but I use it too lol
GilDash: I'm not sappy...
6this is a stupid and pointless argument lol
getting tired...2 1/2 hours left to go -_- and I still have to drive to some guy's house to get some display cases...before sleeping
b/w but still yes.
14^
ok
@sagas wat?
14people, if you want to use my nick just tell me
Broccoli_Pony: you want clothes, they have iron-on and fabric paper
14we'll find a way
/me RUNS
6umbreon has a thousand nicknames, but xai is never around up until now
Om: I didn't say you needed to be. Maybe I just wanted you to listen...
Broccoli_Pony: you want posters, make them
/me sits on Viri
Broccoli_Pony: I said you are deliciouse
i only have like 3
6so really there is no fault
03yeah I didn't see a problem with it
o-o
03granted
Xai is here
6on EITHER side
darnit what's the command to see the list
I have like 2
ohno
03I don't know why he needed Lucario and not kept it Rukario
hrup
Broccoli_Pony: figurines - pepakura/origami
07glist
03but that aside, w/e
Broccoli_Pony: and nutricious
LOL
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m46x27w0Rd1r5uu2fo1_250.png is the original broccoli pony.
that's what i thought
/me sits on Avis in return :D
GilDash: *sigh* That's fine.
thats if you grouped the name
Ahhh!
Om: ... Gimme a hug? :(
that's what i did months back
. . . . . .Hmmm
God I love the spirit temple music
So...relaxing
ouch
03heh
You can no expire nicks you know
03I still don't see why people need so many names
10drf already has -2 on respect?
Useless crate! Yay!
12i know Xanbreon
Om: Please?
12hence [19:05:48] Ok, we need to stop this dropping of nicks after so long
03oh, so apparently it *can* go down
i only have 3 registered
Rather than disabling the nick dropping feature (which is practical)
Oh..
10Nono
03vyneir or something
GilDash: Why. . .
10It's on the post
what is in that jar?
10My bad
fine
i have 5
buying keys?
well, lunchtime-o'clock is over for me... back to work (kinda, I just can't be in here where I'll get distracted...)
6I don't care though
It's a jar of piss
Bear Grylls approved
Jim: Of course it is!
see ya User0
03I don't "care", I'm just pointing out that he has a bunch of names
:D sorry I asked
should be four
6I have a few as well, two are my mobile and alternate mobile, and three are my main online and alternate online names
12I kinda care that people didn't really think about this.
i thought i manually dropped rukario
I ot a jar of dirt. I got a jar of dirt!
/ns saset nickgoeshere noexpire
6think about what?
And guess what's inside it
Om: I just want a hug from somepony. :(
Blu is about to win
12"Oh maybe I should check with the admins first"
6with what
03I should just go register Rayquaza, never use the name, and set it to never expire
03:D
6nick dropping?
inb4 game over
I just realized I never did make that jar of Derp
/me hugs GilDash
ONE MORE F*CKING DAY
Lots of people have no idea if a nick is "used" unless its registered
hugs GilDash i would hug you :)
03LOL
03hi
12No, before using a name that was in use by admins or other users
GilDash: You know there are plenty willing to ablige
hi guyz
^ LOL
6whelp
6no offense by this
Om: I don't want a number... I want you... :(
tomorrow's my last day of classes
You can force drop nicks, then set it to forbidden
...
or force group it and no expire it
/me hugs killerpony7733 and sagas.
God, I wish I had the money to aimlessly buy a bunch of shit
Then I have wensday off then two consecutive days of exams
Oh mai
14uhm
if you were in my room right now GilDash, I would hug you where you stand
It was going to be a mobile of Derpy Hooves poses spinning around in a glass jar
14I'm kinda lost now
:P
14what's the problem?
14o.o
6xai hasn't been around much, and when he is he uses xai, so I can't really blame umbreon for using it considering he's been wanting it for months
and then my algebra 2 trig exam tusday I think
IRC is majikk
sagas: I know. :)
14ohh
I. Don't. Understand.
12Ok, thing is? We argued about this before
that or many blind bag ponies painted like Derpy in a jar
Depends on your oper flags any oper may be able to noexpire a nick
12That's why I'm disappointed
we argued?
Om: ... Just do it, please? :(
GilDash what sagas said ;)
03LOL expecting people to remember every argument that goes on
sagas: see ya
6and i think this is a load of BS that is being argued about lol...
12and it's probably bound to happen again if I don't make people aware of this
bye
killerpony7733: Likewise. :)
6to be quite honest
6I forgot xai was an admin
12he isn't
12Lugia is
ha
You cant really expect everyone to be aware of all the nicks you are not supposed to use
03^
6...
12Unless
Werk is head shot king
12You've been told before?
GilDash: Is this a trap >.>
6we were discussing xai's name though o_O
are we talking about the lugia incident, this incident, or both
*Wrek
And its really bad that you didnt set a *root* server admin nick to not expire..
12Or if it's really really obviously like Lugia's name?
because now i'm confused
03LOL well Xanbreon
14just stick a topic on the forums about taken nicks? xD
12I am talking about both
Screw work, eat books
Om: If it were a trap I'd be winking at you. :(
03because she did the config
6I'm hella confused now
Problem boss?
12Xanbreon, not my server :/
03is what I meant
03:P
6the lugia thing is in the past and it was dealt with
I cant stand these frowney faces!
Why books when you have Broccoli, |Discord|?
Om has a hard decision to make...
GilDash: I'll remember that. And in stead, you are using sad fluttershys...
12I'm sorry I only just found that out today?>
6but currently people are arguing about a problem that HASN'T been
If i had been malicious its a shortish jump from that to totally taking control of the network
12Or yesterday?
:P
oh boy
6wuh
:/
09,01Jeebus, what a hot day
|Discord|: Paper doesnt digest well
oh hey DCD.
12I wasn't arguing, I was TELLING people what the problem was and how we need to fix it.
14o.o
Im pretty sure you dont have limits on pw attempts on oper stuff
12and of course that it shouldn't have happened in the first place
6ok again, how hard is it for people to just....give up a name and deal with the one they HAVE?
Hello NewDCD! Hows your day been?
NewDCD: Easy for you to say, I'm freezing my blood toes off here
it's because people hate change
03I don't think anybody else here has access to that stuff
Not my job to secure your network :P
03I technically *can* change w/e but I'd end up breaking it
6except you just changed names lol
03so I don't touch it
Oh hi CCCP! I didnt see you there
Om: Exactly. Why uses Fluttershy to tease?
70% of company projects fail due to employee resistance
sagas: hi :/
14uhm
14the problem is that people use nicknames taken by someone else
CCCP: What the matter? :(
14right?
GilDash: Well they are. Because. I don't, like sad flutters... Happy flutters is best.
14or did I miss something? o.o
be right back - :| Have an adendum to add to my safety meeting - *sigh* some new guy burned up a panel
that and we are territorial creatures
sagas: im ok
What's wrong CCCP :(
6viri, Lucario was a name that was dropped
6so umbreon took it, but it was originally xai's
im ok
sinds last update my steam craps on me
03Lugia was already dropped
Cypresswolf: Gotta love safety meetings
Om: Then, hugs? :(
MadSurge: i really am
So all the rooms are the same....
14oh
CCCP: Please do tell
14well, if it was dropped o.O
Aww, cos I was totally srs about that nick
and someone took it too?
can i at least hold onto the nick until xai comes and actuallly asks me personally for it?
12It was dropped by accident.
03LOL I know right Xanbreon
What song is this?
03People need to learn to tell the difference between joking and being srs
12Lucario, that will be tonight if you're around
GilDash: I, don't know. . .
6the problem with "lugia" being someone's nick is that it was a well known admin for the longest time
we'll see
03well yeah
sagas: im ok!!!!! lol really
6many people here would recognize it and think you're him
Broccoli_Pony: only during episodes streams we get different rooms
6and new people will probably have the same reaction
03I don't think Xanbreon was ever being serious though, he just did that for fun and stopped using the name like 10 seconds lager
The problem is that no one bothered to noexpire it
03*later
Om: ... Take your time then... :(
CCCP: But something is the matter! I want to know
or during the movie night.
I swapped to it to make a joke
Okay. How do you guys keep notifying me?
6OK well obviously that's being fixed
03exactly
03it was already fixed
loled when I realised it wasnt regged
03like 10 seconds after it happened
:D
12Wait what?
Broccoli_Pony: Like this
we type your name, Broccoli_Pony.
03not sure why we're even mentioning it now
sagas: ok :)
Hiya everypony
also, tab is a auto complete.
Hi Shimmer
hi Shimmer.
Seriously? That simple?
This week is about safety rules - 3 pages long without me having to add to it
6again this is stupid >.>
GilDash: I don't. See why you want one. So much.
/me flops on Shimmer
it kind of is ytes
yes
Broccoli_Pony: YEP.
UGH, everything hurts!
Maybe I can notify myself...
12Ok thanks for that, basically what I heard was that Xanbreon intentionally took the name knowingly and kept it
Fuuuu... i can't kill it freaking belial killing me on 2 hits...
it's not causing any damage
Om: Hugs make me happy. :(
Broccoli_Pony
darn.
Also /ns forbid nickname reason
well this case anyway
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Are you on Inferno?
Broccoli_Pony: doesn't work that way :D
/me hugs GilDash again so he stops being so frowney
/me flops on Shimmer
↓ is jelly
GilDash: You have goten plenty of them.
I like overpowerd guns and OP classes that use them
Very_Silly_Filly normal lol
Om: I want one from *you*. :(
Err, it was dropped, i regged it cos it was funny, when I noticed that it was a net admin i told NS and she fixed it
Airpuff|Eating: BACK!
Dunno what else you wanted me todo?
12Lucario, it is bothering me, can you not tell?
Hello. Shimmer how are you :D
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Honestly, try the auction house, gear is cheap, so spend some gold in the AH
GilDash: Mine would be no different than anyone elses.
Honestly, REALLY does you good
Discord is jelly.
Om GilDash just wants one from you and your being asked nicely ;)
12She just said she'd take care of it.
yes, i can tell, but it's bothering me as well that something so simple is bothering you
If a nickname is dropped, it should be fair game, if you dont want it to be, reg it stuff
6I didn't want to wake up to find all of this in the main channel
Didn't know that already.
How does the auction house work. Is it for in game gold?
6call me back if you guys decide on something >.>
I 2 hitted Belial on Nightmare
12Lucario, because you took someone's name?
Tied using a Shimmer pony as a pillow. howabout you :)
Thanks to AH
03<Articuno> Ok thanks for that, basically what I heard was that Xanbreon intentionally took the name knowingly and kept it <- hence "people need to learn to tell the difference between joking and being serious"
13k guys stfu for a moment
Om: It'd be from you, Ommy. That's different. :(
12and you've kept it? ov0
13Lucario, change your name back to what it was for now
killerpony7733: And I cant stand it. Make me feel werd
13ask Xai about it yourself later
12Someone with some sense.
12XD
/me is talking to Broccoli_Pony
/me knows already
GilDash: Different, is not always better.
awww i like that song
14meh
03also I do think it should have beens orted privately between Articuno and Umbron
/ns drop nick

Hi AlienEd27

Also you should have all oper nicks noexpired
that mistake has to be honored
Ow, stop it feet
hello AlienEd27! Hows your day been?
Om sometimes overthinking something isn't the answer just do it instead :)
hey AlienEd27 hows yoru day been
Stop hurting!
Om: I'll never know if you don't ever try. :(
Broccoli_Pony: PONYS to the yard.

panda|scavenging: You were getting. Stamps? Right?
WRITE IT DOWN

Om: yeah and tea!
killerpony7733: Thinking is always the answer
It's been slow, but that's not important
↓ is now my slave
NEXT MARE TO POST GETS A KISS D:
GilDash: Use your imagnination.
like when my friend won 5000 dollars at a pokemon tournament instead of 500 because of a typo on the check
AlienEd27: Do tell.
panda|scavenging: What kind?
pokemon internatinal had to honor that mistake and pay the typoed amount
Om: I've expended my imagination. It's not the same... :(
Om: mailing stamps....
internatinal
Go make me a sammich.
Pfft.
oh right >.<

Om: arizona...
03I was well aware he was joking around when it happened a couple months ago
bring me your finest wenches
03o_O
You want me as a slave sure about that?
panda: I am dissapoint
03not sure who made it out to be a serious thing
Om yet you can't see something good to giving GilDash a good?
AlienEd27: Fair enough I have those days too
I mean I thought your "Area" was important to keep
Om hug*
GilDash: Ahh. Sorry to hear that.
Its automatically dropped now anyway
sigh i need time to myself
:P
Om: why? i bought tea bags too, and some earl grey and oolong ^^
killerpony7733: What do you know of this.
Om: If you were sorry you'd hug me. :(
How do you people color your text?
/me noms on the channel
/me blasts Broccoli with MEW before he get's a chance
panda: I cant drink ear grey, way to much caffine for me...
sagas: but it's been like that for ages now, there is nothing interesting going on
If its sitting there, not registered, whats to stop some noob coming along and grabbing it?
Broccoli_Pony, staff only.
With no idea of anything
GilDash: You're breaking my heart!
/me shrugs
Okay.
03I have mixed thoughts on it really
12Xanbreon I'm not blaming you ov0
GilDash: I've never done that before.
03Obviously names like Lugia we don't want people to take
Om: why is that? i mean :(
12I was misinformed
03but at the same time
03if they never actually use the IRC
AlienEd27: Oh that is a shame. You should try doing something
03why should we hold the name
12Someone told me you'd taken it, I reported it and no one told me it was unserious
Heehehe
Poor wrek owned by a machina
Om: I'll have you know that you did hug "it" once.
Om i'm but speaking from my own lifestyle i don't think saying no to something thats being asked nicely from you isn't meant to be turned down
03because Lugia was the only time it happened before this
14people, if you don't stop talking about nicks I swear I'm going to post ponies
/me blows Broccoli_Pony s nuts off.
panda: Before last week, the last time I have had any caffine in quantity. Was 5 years ago.
Om: Then just open up a little. You can get over it and I can feel better. :(
14o.o
03like if I were to register a name like LUcario
03er
03why did I say Lucario
Om: so you dont have tolerabce?
Broccoli_Pony, also, mind the RP, since it really isnt permitted beyond small things.
14x3 jk
poni poni poni
03I meant to say Rayquaza
eats Broccoli_Pony
Wrek u damn good at snipen
s nuts
03because I like Rayquaza
03I use it for a day or two
03then never use it again
03should it really be set to never expire?
panda: None at all.
03that just seems silly to me.

GRATZ!
'afternoon scoot
GilDash: Next weeks Tuesday.
hello Scoot-Scootaloo! Hows your day been?
Broccoli_Pony: not best pony, but best cmc :D
ALL THE GRATZ WREK: D
ew poines :<
Wrek: Hey wrek I will buy hats or ALL of them
03well not to mention Articuno, this was a few months ago anyway
03that it happened
funny thing is
CrazyCherry: That's too damn long. :(
03and again, we sorted it
00,03I see someone tried to use my nick, then again it's not the most original name :D
Wrek is OP!
12Ok, DRF i didn't know this
PONI PONI
there isnt many Demomen on
:P
12It was reported to me YESTERDAY or something
03Xanbreon found some vulnerability that let him become an oper using Lugia's name
sagas if i had the chance, i'd go on some crazy adventure.. but I'm stuck reliving the same day over and over again...
Then who is best pony, panda?
Looks like headshot hour.
00,03And I've been busy recording x_x
Allo everypony.
No
Broccoli_Pony: rarity of course my dear
14oh, Articuno, can I PM you?
not a pony, but best cmc
Not oper, services admin
/me slaps HML with ponies
:P
03ah
14:D
Scoot-Scootaloo: recording what?
03same idea though
hi Meanwhile
Not quite
12Viri only if it's important
00,03Recording for tomorrows event!
03Viri, seriously, slapping someone with stuff you know they don't like
03is asking for people to ahte you
eww :<
03*hate
03just saying
Scoot-Scootaloo: oh hehe :D i cant wait :D
14I was joking :(
You cant actually do anything with services admin without oper
Scoot-Scootaloo: THere is an event tomorrow? :S
AlienEd27: That sound horrible. Go for a walk maybe?
03as much as rubbing negativity in people's faces is annoying, the same goes to the reverse
03:P
GilDash: read the front page ^^
but oper plus SA = yay database
Scoot-Scootaloo: whats tomorrows event?
Guys
/me slaps HML with...with...stuff he likes ?_?
:>
Also your nick password database is plaintext afaik
panda: Damnit, I've just come back and my homepage is the RD chat, okay? :D
GilDash: You were away for 5 days, and I beared it! You should too.
So you could just grab peoples pw's
etcetc
You're just chicken. That gives me an idea! SCOOTALOO! SCOOT-SCOOTALOOOO!
My laptop fan sounds like a hoover, only slightly quieter
Scoot-Scootaloo what event?
03LOL
Is that a good sign/ ;s
GilDash: XD well i read the letters if there is a new one :D
03that might explain something
hiya Scoot-Scootaloo
12Guys, the way the name change was presented to me was that it had been taken and was in use.
00,03Tomorrow at bronyfunds, I'm going to read My Little Dashie and it's sequel with Bree Faith, Rina Chan, and other voice actors for Bronyfunds!
sagas I've done just that for two weeks now, everywhere i go it's just the same thing all over again :(
03I remember the original Lugia got ahold of my password and started mocking me with it
03like years ago
03that's prolly how
Scoot-Scootaloo: neat
12and when I saw Umbreon do the same thing I honestly thought we have a problem here
Sorry for rape punctuation, shift key doesn't work
03if they're really stored in plain text
03XD
GilDash: also, i know what they all are going through....
05whats a good pony relatd name for a knife?
oooh hope it all goes well there Scoot-Scootaloo
00,03dat repitition
That'd be nice if it weren't for the terrible choice in story.
05related*
CrazyCherry: That's 7! :(

AlienEd27: That sucks. Well the internet will always be here for you (as long as you pay the bills)
20PcShaper
03when we first set up the server
00,03^
20PcSharper*
Chrysalis: no, 20%Sharper
I dunno, you would have to ask her
10 seconds sharp?
12everyone should be backwards :D
20pc SHARPER!
Whoever said Spike
me!
Thats genius
:D
GilDash: You're away for 5 days in a shorter time than I so... yeah. :/
05Pinkie Pie's Carver
otakon dont think you can use % in a name
Cutin10secflat Wrek
sagas yeah, the only thing that saves me, or else i would have gone mad years ago
Chrysalis: oh
Yus!
03yeah, honestly all I did was pay for an IRCD host and give the info to her
00,03Chicken Scratch!
Cupcake creator/
Cupcake Carver, surely.
03since at least in this regard, I admit to knowing nothing about how IRC servers are run
03:P
When you get her ACS13123? how you been?
CrazyCherry: Were are you even going? :(
03I read that as "nope"

GilDash: Catholic thing
/me shall call a pet like that in future
...
Very_Silly_Filly: you are a very silly filly ^^
CrazyCherry: ... I've no experience or knowledge of religion at all. Other than to, you know, avoid it. :$
GilDash: you arent religious???
/me is hungry
I'm going to watch pinkie pie sing the smile song :3
13too lazy to get food
12:D
AlienEd27: :D
No religious talk in chat. It never ends well.
panda: why is that surprising?
/me throws a Latté to AE
panda: Why. Are you?
12annnnd possibly
panda i ain't either techinally i'm a atheist though
12Ok question, who is seeing the up and down arrows on the forum and who isnt?
Agrees with Meanwhile.
13I can't see them o.o
panda: Let's just say no and leave it at that. I hate going into detail.
14I don't
I am the problem with the world.
hiya Meanwhile what's up?
GilDash: Atheist type person? Me too. :/ I just have to bear it to get presents.
12Do you just see the 0 then?
It's true, some days are dark and lonelyand maybe you feel sadbut Pinkie will be there to show you that it isn't that bad
sagas, Om killerpony7733 and everyone else, dont you think being a brony is somewhat a religion? we gather on a one spot and stuff... like we are our own sect, per se
CrazyCherry, trufax.
hey Meanwhile hows your day been
otakon: Camping a rare mob on WoW. Not much else. You?
13yes D:
also, sup Meanwhile.
Meanwhile: Meanie
CrazyCherry: Why not just say you're an atheiest? :S
13also the respect thing makes me laugh for some reason
Why is everyone suddenly pinging me.
Meanwhile: bored and jobless, with little hope for the future atm.
lucky crit
I got here like 10 minutes ago.

GilDash: TO GET PRESENTS!!!
13It makes me think "RESPECT YO" followed by a fistbump
Meanwhile: bc we like you
otakon: Know that feel.
otakon whats happening
14I use the shadow lugia theme
14can't see the arrows D:
/me hugs otakon
panda: I like ponies and all, but I dont think they are God or have anything to do with the after-life
12Just to check, you're all looking at other people's posts and not your own right?
otakon: i wish you could come over :(
You do? That's just weird.
lol the shadow lugia theme
13Yes :3
/me kisses Shimmer because I can
it's ridiculous
12Because it doesn't show on your own
Meanwhile: ping
12Ok
I liek it but the font colors are awful
14hey, it's dark xD
14all the stuff in my PC is dark
14o.o
panda one thing and this may surprise you but i am not a brony BUT i like to interact with the community i just don't see myself as one
Meanwhile: That is an odd thing?
sagas: never said that.... im refering only to the dedication aspect of it
mawhahaha :)
killerpony7733: you arent a brony???
when replying to a post, look at the names of the people who posted before you (under your reply)
13but what about when you go to google home page
you can't see half of them
alexxm: nothing, that's what. No one has called me back for job interviews or the like in months. It's like no one wants to hire unless someone dies.
13suddenly
13bright white page
cuz the names are the same font as the bg
otakon: Again, know that feel.
uh
it's not THAT dark
panda yes....but read what i said i love interacting with the community and what not but i just don't see myself as a brony ;)
14AE, stylish.org
14:D
It's the worst when they can't even be bothered to get back to you with a "no"
12that's something i can fix
k
13no u, I tried it once and my eyes hurt from the sudden change LOL
panda: Well to be a religion is to deal with the supernatural. I guess you could say i have dedication, but only as a hobby or fandom.
14Aurora, until someone is going to make a darker theme...x3
14lol
so the post color alternates, the names are the same color as the lighter shade
Shimmer: um...you could just ask them.
killerpony7733 PREPARE TO BE INDUCTED INTO THE HERD!!!
/me hopes shimmer is female too
13I just use the default Lugia and Articuno theme
05this sogn is weird
killerpony7733: oh i see :D well... i wont force you into the herd
05but cool
CrazyCherry: I wouldn't have thought the hassle worth it.
13http://i.imgur.com/H8Guk.jpg the nothing is coming
Meanwhile you say that like its unusual
02^
13ESPEON THEME PLZ
/me is shot
Broccoli_Pony nope you can't change my mind :D
Looks like a bunch of iron, @Shizuka
12Anyone else that CAN see the arrows?
Shimmer: Good godesses that's bad. :D
its more unusual for a company to get back with a no
mare + mare kiss is best kiss.
Shizuka any idea what happened there
Shizuka: what?
GilDash: I wouldn't have my moped if I wouldn't go there so...
than to simply bin the application
Darn it, killerpony7733
Shimmer: Knowing the internet, hes most likely not
sagas: well, the rate we are spreading, i wouldnt classify it as a fandom or hobby
Shizuka: Looks like someone loaded the ink wrong.
Meanwhile: yeah, I had McDonalds MCDONALDS not even call me back after a interview where they SAID they would sign me up for training. How bad is it that even McD's won't hire you?
Holy crap what is that Shizuka?! I should show that to my co-worker. Oh btw my co-worker HATES printers.
07ya
YOU HEARD ME
13that's called toner.... i can't possibly be the only person here that knows what toner is...
Shizuka: Better watch out,
13okay good...
PMV Mini-
12ov0
Madness
02I wants a Latios theme D:
/me runs
12I have no idea why some people can't.. sorry
07also, not espeon
Shizuka: you need to refil your toner :D
Shimmer: It goes in laser printers. Ive sold tonnes of it over the phone before.
07espy and bree
Shizuka: that is kind of scary looking
panda: No, panda, NO
hello Shizuka! Hows your day been?
/me hides
Broccoli_Pony but as i said i very much love interacting with the community *I* just don't see myself as a brony
/me shakes head in annoyance.
whut?
Shimmer: Tab fail. Sorry.
00,03To... ner. Sorry, I don't listen to rap ._.
otakon Mcds arnt always hiring, everyone ends up going to them at this time of year when school leavers realise how crap there grades are
Shizuka oh its not that I don't know what toner is, its just I have never seen toner do that.
Very_Silly_Filly: what?
Do you watch it, killerpony7733?
12What browsers are you using @ people who can't see
Shizuka: Yeah, but toner goes in a laser printer, not over the floor. :D
13Firefox
Chrysalis: It's sad that it's not unusual.
Broccoli_Pony watch what?
panda: I swear you were coming up with a sexual related joke
6firefox
14Firefox
Ohhhh your on the web chat!!!
6latest version
12..I could see them at work and I used Firefox.. weird
13pfffff
6where are they?
07I can see them on FF
Shizuka: Unless a terrorist gets ahold of it. Then apparently its suddenly a bomb on planes. =_(\
I'm using mIRC
13toner goes everywhere
6on the post
07but
Chrysalis: argh this sucks, at this rate I'll have to move in with my cousin on the Western side of MD again and I HATE moving
12On the right
This fan is scaring me
Erryday ahm tonin
Because I've met a few people who watch My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic but don't consider themselves "bronies."
07it's 3.5.19
07XD
so thats why i get my own themes
Very_Silly_Filly: no... why would i be pervy toward Shizuka? she is a mare i respect and she is a lady and should be called as such ^^
/me adpjsfohdgbvhsak zncmx
CrazyCherry: liking what Chat kinda froze on me
I just had to refesh the chat and why does a massive wall of text pop up with a ton of notifications?
Pinkie pie always makes me smile :)
It's sounds like a vacuum cleaner
/me opens Internet Explorer and tries with that
6yeah I don't see it
12It's what? XD
It's pretty loud

It has come to my attention that I need food. Back in a bit.
hello MahBoi777! When you get here? Hows you day been?
AlienEd27: That sounds like love
12Mine hasn't updated either..
Broccoli_Pony ah well i do fill all things to be a brony but i just don't choose to be one i'm what you could call a fan of the show and its community even being part of it but i just don't want to be a brony thats all :$
GilDash: Where've you been for the last few days?
12Let me update
13I keep thinking you mean Final Fantasy
6angel
14I use Firefox because it's the browser I'm using most
6it's not like i LIKE safari
03<Articuno> EW APPLE AND IE <- I get hating Apple, but what's wrong with IE :P
02well, safari is fine on Apple stuff
03IE is actually decent now
6there's a reason I use firefox >.>
14not counting the Nintendo DS Browser (opera) xD
killerpony7733: closet brony :)
6Safari is just there for stuff like this
03LOL the DS browser
Yep. I know people just like that who hate the fandom.
ill make it up to you, ok Shizuka-chan?
Meanwhile: Download Festival 2012. Go and google it like every other that's asked me today. :D
6anyways
03that's such a pathetic pile of crap
hello sagas! I've been lurking for a few minutes, I'm doing fine, u?:D

13I used to use Safari back when flash wouldn't work on any other browser I downloaded
13sad times ;w;
lol
03I love how people these days are like
Very_Silly_Filly2 but i'm not in love! i just seem to breathe so slow that my heart slows down to a complete halt :O
Im doing pretty good MahBoi777
GilDash|AFK: I don't really care about it I was just wondering if you could go back there.
03"My computer's broken, how can I install software to get around this"
03rather than the sensible "My computer's broken, I should FIX it"
hey MahBoi777 what have you been up to today
/me runs
Meanwhile: Next year, sure. :)
12Ew firefox
02drf, it is better than the wii browser if you ask me
6the people who generally say that don't know HOW to fix it
and it feels like it's taken a beating :S
AlienEd27: You MIGHT wanna see a doctor about that
Meanwhile: I'll drag you with me as you're on the way there. :p
03well
Usually shouldn't happen
hey alexxm! nuthin much so far, u?
