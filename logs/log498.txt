00,02lets see how this goes
00,10full burn on the liqueds
Can you reach the sun in .14? I know you can't on 13 - had some strange, strange things happen when I tried
anyone want more symphonic metal?
That was a good beat going on...
never tried to hit it
Orbit is easy.
night~
I hit it. Or tried to rather
Or Nightwish
cause they are supposed to be able to, but i never got them to go
00,02well poo
sooo goodnight!
ended up going into negative altitude, with a pseudo-stable orbit _inside_ the sun itself
00,10oh and make sure you use the rcs to stableise once you get to the last set of solids
Oh yeah
00,10too early for rcs
00,02'jebediah kerman
00,02Sumica, stabilizers wern't doing it, turned it on for a bit
00,10yeahjust let it
Rarity wins.

00,02left is bill
Celestia wins :3

00,02xxMoopyxx,
00,02k
Inb4 immenant doom.
00,10nah this is a proven insain desgin

spaaaaaaaaaaace
weeeeeeeeeeeeee
dat barra roll.
... I see now.
00,10woona!
yes it is
:D
I never could land on that damn Mun
you can use that little arrow at the bottom of the map screen to access the ball and controls in map mode...
00,02gah
Rain - got there by accident today... no fuel, in a strange orbit, got yanked in by the Mun
00,02i cannot figure which way is which
*explodes*
Yeah, it's as I thought.
do it
00,10kill the rcs
00,10line it up where you want to go.
but how do you know where that is?
Mun*
there's one at 180 with three lines in a bisected triangle pattern which represents exact opposite.
Thanks anyway :3
00,10if you are looking at the line between brown and blue you are set for orbit
00,10just need to be going fast enough to hold it
get up to apogee, and full burn at 180, you have orbit.
00,02i screwed this up
Oh
00,10the other is where you are going.
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, sure
Nuts
close, and he has lots of fuel to make an attempt.
TO THE MOOOON!
flo...rida...
-_-
ikr
/me drools

Where's da moon!?
/me tries to whistle along, nut lacks the ability to whistle :<
Who's streaming?

00,10use camera
00,02i cant find the moon
00,10keep looking

I saw the moon there :P

00,02XD
00,10be systamadic
Back in the 50's it was.

Lawl Sumiva XD
00,02Sumica, the thing has gyros
00,02plus very little rcs fuel
the stock gyros, yeah
00,10cause you left it on for most of lift off
00,10less type more aim

NOW TO AIM!
fiiting
This is about the time I would expect the spanish inquisition
TrixieBackonMuffin: ( -_-)*\)
This is fitting because it's going nowhere xD jk
00,10just burn slow and corect on the move
00,10sloww burn
It's feasible
This is the closest to the Moon yet!
cause it seems to me it takes a long time to get there
I think he's gonna run out of fuel before he can get the right insertion tho...

Saturn: Not sure i could afford the shipping
03you do the same to me LOL
12OMG
do somebody knows a joke?
03regardless, I hate forum rep systems
The only pony I have is a McDonalds Celestia I took from my 3 year old sister (left it under the couch=mine).
XD
08,01sagas: shipping would be cheaper than buying some of these books
12Well this one works differently :3
03because it turns everything into a competition
03who can get the most rep
Yep.
08,01i have a book on coding theory and information theory that i paid £150 for
that's one expensive book
03isn't that why you're having a vote to beginw tih?
12They are well aware of this, everyone has the power to mess this up
03I already said why I don't like it :P
08,01it's a tiny book too
08,01but it's very, very good
Saturn How common are Euros in Scottland?
03fine

03I don't think I've seen any of the phpBB forums I frequent ever have database errors like yours does
and i see a stream
/me runs
8,6yeah, sometimes with that message it's a browser issue, sometimes an isp issue, sometimes a wtf issue
12Database errors???
thanks for being there in my time of need
8,6:3
12ov0 when does it have database errors?
12You mean Php errors?
12That's because I am physiocally going in and breaking the code XD
03you know, the reason you kept refusing the hosts I showed you?
03because they suck at databases
he's*
*hug*
03and it would give random errors that it can't connet
03*connect
12DRF stop, you know nothing XD also I was using Phpbb back then :3
12So there
I really wish I could be joining in the TF2 fun right now...
Flamed hurrr
03uh
03no you weren't LOL
:P
12Yes I was
e_o
03wasn't it the same forum system the entire time it was lugia.us?
12Yes, but before that, I was using Phpbb.
03I'm talking about lugia.us

Whoa, that's one huge Luna
12Yep
12Because
12It was nothing to do with the software
03I'm not claiming to know about the coding, I'm just saying as an end user, phpBB is awesome
8,6the Luna was a birthday gift a friend has custom made for me ^_^
12<drfsupercenter> I don't think I've seen any of the phpBB forums I frequent ever have database errors like yours does
oh
look similar
03what caused them I dunno
8,6I think I have 3-4 of the Fluttershy blindbags
07hurr
12you're saying I have errors because of the type of forum I used..
i haz only one blindbag
12if you dunno, then don't say it :3
07ratings should be interesting
I has 0 blindbags...
You need to do RD hair, kir

12*XD
03Kyubree this is coming from back when I was a forum noob
03and I'd ask questions
03people kept down-voting them because they thought it was common sense
03and I ended up with like, the worst rep on the forum LOL

03um
03if my post was the first post
03then yes.
12Ok but you don't do that here
03and since everybody there is an expert, they thought they were trivial questions
03:P
Oh, alright. I understand that.
03No I know
Hey everypony
03but other people do
12So you have nothing to worry about unless you say something stupid XD
03well
03don't you consider everything I say stupid :D
12Yeh but we actually help them here
12DRF the only thing I say is stupid about you is when you try to argue about a subject that you know nothing of
:D
03well I was joking around anyway
12Sorry but that's all :3
03since you used to call me a n00b atll the time

03I usually just ignore that type of thread all together, admittedly
-_-
12Ok :3
:D
*cough* american bad aim *cough*
03because hey

03but studying WHY they happen
Just take a meal home after the shift

12Who's stolen Xai's name?
I'm trying to learn C++
03wait, stolen?
6kyu didn't you have to learn all the presidents?
12Lucario is Xai's name..
03oh
12He uses it at work..
D:
03since he can't pick a name and has like 27 of them
03:P
12:/
But none on C++
14o.o
03well
03if people don't ever use them
07uh
6xai does
6he's just not here lol
03when's the last time Xai has used IRC
03like two years ago?
6all the time
07I don't remember learning all the presidents |D
12No more like a few months ago :/
14I don't see Xai here since...December? xP
6kyu alright, I know some schools did
i have never seen Xai
*practice
03^
12and apparently that's too long to keep a name now...
in years
6mine did only as an option back in like 4th grade
03last time I saw him was like a year atgo
03*ago
03well
hmmm
6which, in 4th grade, was the best dam present you could get
12Lugia didn't use IRC because I wasn't using it
:D
03I had nothing to do with that, don't look at me
last time I saw Xai i was i thing 15
12and he was planning to use it now because we need to work on TST....
03I'm just saying I can see *why* it does that
*think
Dam you :D
D:
12Yeh well it's an option that can be changed and it needs changing
6ok seriously this is a stupid and pointless argument
03That's precicely why names expire :P
ha
14o.o
6except I actually use "reshiram" still lol
12Yeh but that's also why we have server admins
03I know
03you're like the only one
03most of the other ones just dropped off
:3
mmm
but it's quite long though, don't you have anything shorter?
Currently arsing around on OoT 3D
we can't ask if they are never online
03^
12Ascendant's never online now?
03no
07actually
03Xai is never online
Yes.
07I still have pidove
07|D
03LOL
07it's been like
6ok again
07a month
eh?
07but I use it too lol
6this is a stupid and pointless argument lol
b/w but still yes.
14^
ok
14people, if you want to use my nick just tell me
14we'll find a way
/me RUNS
6umbreon has a thousand nicknames, but xai is never around up until now
i only have like 3
6so really there is no fault
03yeah I didn't see a problem with it
03granted
Xai is here
6on EITHER side
I have like 2
ohno
hrup
07glist
03but that aside, w/e
LOL
thats if you grouped the name
Ahhh!
. . . . . .Hmmm
So...relaxing
ouch
03heh
You can no expire nicks you know
10drf already has -2 on respect?
i only have 3 registered
Rather than disabling the nick dropping feature (which is practical)
Oh..
10Nono
03vyneir or something
10It's on the post
10My bad
fine
i have 5
buying keys?
well, lunchtime-o'clock is over for me... back to work (kinda, I just can't be in here where I'll get distracted...)
6I don't care though
It's a jar of piss
[13:10:44] -NickServ- 5 nicknames in the group.'
03I don't "care", I'm just pointing out that he has a bunch of names
:D sorry I asked
should be four
6I have a few as well, two are my mobile and alternate mobile, and three are my main online and alternate online names
12I kinda care that people didn't really think about this.
I ot a jar of dirt. I got a jar of dirt!
/ns saset nickgoeshere noexpire
And guess what's inside it
Blu is about to win
12"Oh maybe I should check with the admins first"
03:D
6nick dropping?
02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
I just realized I never did make that jar of Derp
ONE MORE F*CKING DAY
Lots of people have no idea if a nick is "used" unless its registered
03LOL
03hi
12No, before using a name that was in use by admins or other users
hi guyz
^ LOL
6whelp
6no offense by this
tomorrow's my last day of classes
You can force drop nicks, then set it to forbidden
...
or force group it and no expire it
Oh mai
14uhm
14I'm kinda lost now
:P
14what's the problem?
14o.o
and then my algebra 2 trig exam tusday I think
IRC is majikk
14ohh
I. Don't. Understand.
12Ok, thing is? We argued about this before
12That's why I'm disappointed
we argued?
03LOL expecting people to remember every argument that goes on
6and i think this is a load of BS that is being argued about lol...
12and it's probably bound to happen again if I don't make people aware of this
bye
6to be quite honest
12he isn't
12Lugia is
ha
You cant really expect everyone to be aware of all the nicks you are not supposed to use
03^
6...
12Unless
12You've been told before?
6we were discussing xai's name though o_O
*Wrek
14just stick a topic on the forums about taken nicks? xD
12I am talking about both
Screw work, eat books
03because she did the config
Problem boss?
12Xanbreon, not my server :/
03right, go yell at Draelen then
03:P
I cant stand these frowney faces!
12I'm sorry I only just found that out today?>
6but currently people are arguing about a problem that HASN'T been
12Or yesterday?
:P
oh boy
6wuh
:/
14o.o
12and of course that it shouldn't have happened in the first place
6ok again, how hard is it for people to just....give up a name and deal with the one they HAVE?
it's because people hate change
03I technically *can* change w/e but I'd end up breaking it
6except you just changed names lol
03so I don't touch it
70% of company projects fail due to employee resistance
14uhm
14the problem is that people use nicknames taken by someone else
14right?
that and we are territorial creatures
6viri, Lucario was a name that was dropped
03Lugia was already dropped
14oh
14well, if it was dropped o.O
and someone took it too?
can i at least hold onto the nick until xai comes and actuallly asks me personally for it?
12It was dropped by accident.
03People need to learn to tell the difference between joking and being srs
we'll see
03well yeah
6many people here would recognize it and think you're him
The problem is that no one bothered to noexpire it
03*later
or during the movie night.
I swapped to it to make a joke
Okay. How do you guys keep notifying me?
03exactly
03it was already fixed
loled when I realised it wasnt regged
03like 10 seconds after it happened
:D
03not sure why we're even mentioning it now
Hiya everypony
also, tab is a auto complete.
Seriously? That simple?
This week is about safety rules - 3 pages long without me having to add to it

Didn't know that already.

12Lucario, because you took someone's name?
13k guys stfu for a moment

12Xanbreon I'm not blaming you ov0
12I was misinformed
03but at the same time
03if they never actually use the IRC
03why should we hold the name
12Someone told me you'd taken it, I reported it and no one told me it was unserious
Heehehe
03Ascendant is busy and probably didn't have time to look back through logs
14people, if you don't stop talking about nicks I swear I'm going to post ponies
14o.o
dangit.
03er
03why did I say Lucario
14x3 jk
03I meant to say Rayquaza
03because I like Rayquaza
03I use it for a day or two
03then never use it again
03should it really be set to never expire?
03that just seems silly to me.
Okay.
