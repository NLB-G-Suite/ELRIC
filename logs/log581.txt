that slave outfit
all it would've taken is one organized team really
slave outfit FTW
with everyone else just wandering around doing whatever
That's all it takes in most PvP tbh.

Those squeals that the pig does are horrifying
It's a good fing i've seen this movie, i can just peice shit together

He can do everything that you'd normaly do, except use the tradingpost I guess, also no WvW
shacke*
It ain't my computer :P
considering they've had 5+ years to plan and polish, it's going to come out very well I think
Calco323 not as annoying as Willy's whinning from ''Free Willy''

1,000 years of digesion, plenty of time to escape
I jumped in a sarlac pit ones..
R2D2 is now a bar
once* .. wow
00,10If jaba realy wanted to torture them he would make them go colect the two datacrons .
you'd die of hunger before 1000 years are up
I don't want to imagine the smell of the waste resulted from 1000 year old food...
wOW i have issues
omg.. those datacrons succkkkeeddd
lol
00,10Yeah
lol that too
indiana jones
servers make any diference aside from the people playing there ?
2 Datacrons, what's that a reference to?
have one set Euro and one set NA
/me this is MY HOMELAND, motherbucker
lol
familiar
yummy
Also, some servers may have higher populations than other
why does that thing need teeth?
and then there'd be a ping difference depending on where the actual servers are, but aside from those 3 things, not really
MEG? is that you?
LOL
Oh yeah ofc, EU and NA servers.
Those teeth, they don't look like their very well positioned
A person playing on a EU server could guest to a NA server
Pay back time :)
jabbas boned
/me Nods
Oh that's cool.
11,01I'll have to go back to FU.
11,01Been a while since I played it.

Go Leia!
11,01Into the pit you go.
Boba es ded

There is no tank
I never noticed that Boba just got killed by exident...
didn't try that, but I've never really liked melee classes
There is no healers
Dat tongue
we playing on EU servers or American servers?
No Boba lives
Boba didnt die, altho hes not shown again in the movie
omg.. spoilers!
And people think Derpy is an overrated character among fans... Boba Fett had only a few minutes of screentime then died
Oh that's right Guild Wars did weird things with it's classes.
whats the Whilhelm scream?
he escapes digestion
I find it quite awesome
i see no spoilers
LANDO NO
Its having one heck of a buffet
rape
00,10these gunners must suck at lootship.
she took over the derpy episode with a ridiculous side story
LANDO :'(
lootship.. lol
skip, skip, skip, palys for 3 secs, buffer repeat
No Lando!

05atleast 1 person in the world
Derpy had a few seconds of screen time in every cameo she had over 52 episodes. Boba Fett had a story-relavent role in several continual minutes in about 6 hours of movie time.
r34
05guaranteed
or something
Does GW2 have the same kind of mixed-class mechanic that GW has?
tentacle rape and slug combined into one
/me is about to get banned
It doesn't
I can fly wait no I can't
hey hey hey
each weapon has skills associated with it
*heroic
lol he ded
that reminds me have they chopped off any hands yet?
11,01They blow up over the sarlac?
well i guess jabba just gives you more cushion for the pushin
Starwars? :D
well
DAT SOUND QUALITY
cant wait to try it
Bonjour
soo we watching ponies watch star wars
00,10good thing he had that gloce just siting there
yeah
Yeah
Meeeeeh.
11,01It would suck if he got shot in his real hand.

I found it kind of complex, because of all these elementals you swap between
3yes, of course
yeah, and you have to level out each set per element
3and I have the torrent
05yeeeey!
No you're not old at all.

900 years old
Lol
Do you have to do that for every weapon
I didn't try the ele that far
OVER.......900 years old

Stormtrooper armor can't even protect against arrows

05i used to won a lego techno version of the AT-ST
They have arrows and pointy sticks! Hpw we can stand against that technology!
Yeah, why do they use plastic? XD
and then they saw a yellow brick
it cant protect against midget punches
as armor
I guess the Armor has a AC of 0
Or blunt objects
Stormtrooper armour is made out of strong language.
05that you could turn into one of the beige droids from the "first" movie

11,02Someone should tell the two of them that those lightsabers are just effects added in during post production, they aren't really in a 'To-The-Death' sword fight.
13hm
13that needed more railings
