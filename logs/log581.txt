Fou_Lou: racist
Rain: well okay is okay
R means Restricted
Under 17 has to have an adult
restricted to what?
Zeus Carver
:p
ah i see
more feds
Isnt there something above R?
Come to think of it, I think I heard the F word enough for the MPAA to mandate an R rating. Then we have a huge explosion with a contrived lack of casualties.
Fisheh_Fish: lol fuck that

FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDSSSSSSSSSSSS!
Shooeie: X

Johnsons*
X I think or NC-17
nazi xD
It used to be X, XX, and XXX. It all got simplified to NC-17
If you use the word fuck over 2-3 times, it's usually R
what does NC-17 mean?
The sewage near the payphone....
Kandarihu: um no, XXX is pornography
...
crazypony: nopony 17 or under can watch
11,01No children under 17.
No one under 17 permitted crazypony
Kandarihu: XX is single person pornography
No Children under 17

Kandarihu: X is just full nudity and implied sexual content.
otakon: Seems fun.
No children under 120

IIRC, the rule is that in order for a movie to at least have a possibility of anything less than an R rating, there must be less than 4 uses of the F word, and none of the instances being used in a sexual context.

Looks like half of the people i know, including myself is int that 5%, lol

People who use the internet = Higher IQ? =P

Sumica I think I have a half of the Titanic on the line
simon really outdid himself with that bomb...
SirGanjalf: Its so stupid nobody would expect it
Sumica: About the pascal, It's impossible to Boobytrap the pressure due to that the pressure is caused during activation
Wait... SO I missed why they need to get on the boat?
Because the boat looked cool
11,01They caught something Sumi.

Go fishing, catch a boat.

wrek did it
No kidding :D

Or killed by shrapnel
what Wrek said
Wrek: It's safer to jump from back then front.. :P
Just jump far enough
wrek, fun fact #2: shochkwave woulda killed em
^
05probablu
this is hollywood, most rules dont apply here
Between the force of the explosion and the resistance of the air.
aww, he forgot to take his pills
fun fact shockwaves are amplified in water
Lil_B That ''upgrade'' was done in case of emergency........i'll do it when Star Wars: Return of The Jedi comes around
I went into the #2 :D

So many fun facts! lol

05the density of the water and that the explosion originates from a closed container above the water
00,10still has the same maid
05wouldnt the explosion itself be forced upwards?
Fun Fact Nr Truth: There's alot of facts on the internet.
brb.......dinner break
yup, Wrek
05most of the force would travel the easiest path
05so
05sure it might travel easier in water
LAWL
Asprin is a clue
=_(\
DAT KARMA CLUE
wat\
wait, dinner? what time is it at yours?

TheMaster: yeah Ep 1- 3

00,10Ok so because this is more then a trilogy we will show diehard 4 tomarrow
TheMaster: Watched it yesterday
Empire > New Hope >Return. Only three movies ever made.
Barbetos: why U hate ponies?
Pfft.
TheMaster, we saw that yesterday
lowfn 20-ish according b-day girl Lauren Faust
As we all know.
lowfn fully grown up, but still teene-like
uhm:s why are you asking lowfn? and why is that good?:P
Ah okay.
derpy_pony I love pony... just not g3...
"I have something. But I will not share it. I just thought I'd mention having it.
And you WILL bring the g3 asking for it now.
Sumica YAY! Die Hard 4 is the worst one! I can't wait. It's so funny ^_^
well i haven't scan it
Agrold: Oh hehe... ummm no reason.... hehehe.....
so be it
and haven't done any detail to it :p

I want G3 ponies
STAR WARS dammit!
brb, switching computers
Hey Hey Hey, stay outta my shed
GIVE ME PONIES OR GIVE ME DEATH
so anyway.. can we have some seaponies before I have to go?:3
IT'S A TRAP!
the other 3 are so good it hurts comparing them to the 4. one
everyone wants g3 ponies
HungryForChicken, just no
If we're watching Die Hard 4, and it's the worst in the movie, are we also watching Star Wars 1?
What happened to the "There were only 3!" rule you guys had for Indy and Star Wars?
Yes G3 ponies
lol, dat death
Why was I kicked?
there is no such thing as the star wars prequels. that was a terrible, terrible nightmare
Kandarihu: tarwars 1-3 is next week if im not mistaken
you said give u ponies or death
Fou_Lou, I see.
no G3 ponies!
Gimme STAR WARS followed by Family Guy special, followed by Robot Chicken Star Wars special!
he kicked you and said "ded"
Kandarihu Oh god no. Not even GOD could sit through Phantom Menace and not go insane. O_o
:D
Kandarihu: but since they dont exist. no movies next wee :-P
I liked this scootaloo baby scene. Maybe we can watch it for a while
instead of showing the prequels why not play the redlettermedia plinkett reviews
Fou_Lou: Really? If so what other series are they going to pair it with=
Can we have G3.5 then, if not G3?:P
I wonder how much ppl would hate me if i say g3 where my favorite ponies
Sumica your silly.
red_ony: robocop
G1 ponies are only ponies!
/me dusts Sumica's toes again
Fact: We will get G3 ponies if they decide to give us ponys, or worse,
AND this is why i never wanted to see it on 3d
Fox news bad!
00,10funny thing is it dont matter what client you use. it says why you were kicked.
Fou_Lou: AWESOME...well the first one is...the rest doesn't exist...
Much worse than G3
00,10Faux news?
sumi, even web client??
Sumica If star wars 1-3 is next week I'll be skipping Phantom Menace.... its sooooo bad
00,10even web says why
/me glomps and hides in Sumica s hair
I feel stupid for asking but.... what is glomp?
dat fat outro
lowfn, an attack hug
lowfn tackle hug
So, are we shoing star wars 4-6 anytime soon this summer btw?
EVERYPONY knows There's only one Star Wars trilogy
return is next
00,10flying tackle hug generaly
4-6
starwars 1-3 refers to the original series i hope
4-5-6
Agrold: SW 4-6 was/is this week
dat ass.
/me glomps Sumica's toes and then dusts them once more
Agrold, we've been watching them this week.
/me pokes Sumica
there was only three movies.
Glomp = Rugby tackle with LUUUUVEEEE
Eli, 1-3 are the prequels
Pop quiz everypony: What is the question to the answer of life the universe and everything?
There is no such thing as a star wars prequel
fox news may be bad, but at least they think it's better than terrorisim
:(
42
Eli: no to EP1-3 original is 4-6
ah yeah, remember I saw ANH this week, damn.. forgot to tune in on the rest:(
/me 11,01explodes
Every mane 6 pony = Oh dat ass.
Old Intermission
lolwut??
:D
TheMaster: wrong that is the answer what is the question?
11,01Derpycorn.
00,10btw ponibas i know you used quest.
so.. your saying bronies are terroriest?
/me licks the Nittany_Discord juice and chunks of self
dat old
old intermission6_9
I for one support the showing of the Plinkett Reviews of the prequels directly after showing each one
yay, intermission
For the millionth time! FOX News isn't hating on us! It's just one little show on their network!
timer is missing
i know, i was lookkingfor de kick
05fox network can die in a fire
this is probably the best intermission i've seen in ages^^
Kandarihu: was there a new thing on Fox about bronys?
lowfn, That would be madness in a cinema
oi
Amen Wrek.
so it do
...
so it do
I'd think you'd be more hostile to Howard Stern
atleast fox has to hold back
that self kick
"Why cant canada just take us over with a bat"
/me Agrees with Wrek 100% /)
/me 11,01dusts Sumica with pigeon feathers
i think thats what he said
00,10figure we can use both intermitions
Wreck: If fox news die in a fire, I guess you could call them... firefox! YEAAAAAAHHHH!
Fox brought us Family Guy! :P
sumi, yep
evening bronystate
Agrold, Boooo
Agrold: nice one
FairysHuff, just the corruption can die in a fire.
/me dusts Nittany_Discord 's toes as a reward

mmmm lemon...
lol, Hitch Hikers reference
Hello there
who was in the flame war on 4-chan?
jst a few
00,10countless
Kandarihu That would be nice but unrealistic. The entire system is infected to it's core with the disease of corruption. You'd have to burn it all down and start again.
yep
HungryForChicken, Implying there's been only one flame war on 4-chan
Fou_Lou, you must've heard about it before already. Greg Gutfeld, host of FOX News' watershed comedy show Red Eye is not too fond of us.
WE NEED V
i know jim
Original V!!!
hi
Kandarihu: i just have seen the little thingy with a guy and a girl talking bad about bronys. is it that bit?
FairysHuff, one party is completely corrupt, and has convinced everyone that the other party is even more corrupt (even though there are good parts of it)
V for Vendetta... one of my favorite movies
wait you mean there is a time 4-chan doesn't have a flame war?
we're seeing VI today >_>
yes
V for vegeta
i meant the series "V" but that movie is great too
VVVVVV
^
Darf14: great game^^
/me remembers the 5th of Novemeber
Kandarihu I'll believe that when politicians stop taking bribes from big business.
^ for ^endetta
Fou_Lou, I don't know.
00,10^^VV<><>BA
lol, Sumi
I agree FalonSquirreltamor
W VV Which is the double V? Hint: Its not the right but the opposite of left
Sumica: ya forgot start
Kandarihu: lol. was there more than on instance with Fox news and bad brony press?
This music is making me want to play Ghost in the Shell on my PS2
FairysHuff, that's not the case with every politician
night guys, I need to hug my lonely cold bed now
Kandarihu, Just most, right?
oh soo lonnelllyyy
so lonellllyyyy
Night Agrold!

night Agrold
Hi everypony!
o/
bye Agrold :)
hai Pudge
hi Pudge
inb4 admonishing
dammit LAG!
Kandarihu They are the blessed few... who will also never get into a position of real power to change anything within the system.
Fou_Lou, frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if Greg Gutfeld were compelled to revisit us since we took it so personally.
Hye Pudge :)
hey everypony what i miss?
My body is ready for Jedi Strikes Back
Who was the guy who got the (What is the oldest question ever?) right?
00,10oh that reminds me. Shizu added a new code to the site. put in up,up,down,down,left,rightleft,right,backspace on the theader page.
ok fine...
TO, You missed Die Hard
crap :(
Sumica: hahahahaha...no
proud to say i no longer eat popcorn at movies. now i have mini muffin bites
HungryForChicken, NO non-image links during stream (yes, even intermission)
Sumica: How come the old intermission is up?
nope sumica
Oh are we back to using the old intermission?
FairysHuff, one such good politician pretty much killed a treaty that would've given control of the oceans to the U.N.
dammit sumica
ponibas: ?
Sumica, good one.
That is all I need to say goodbye
everyone does that.
twas a trick!
and my chat derped, brb
all those client closures
Kandarihu: ok i see then were probably talking both over the same instance. Talk bad about us -> get Shitstorm. Talk justified-> get a nice drawing of you as a pony ^-^
It causes the bowser to go back one step in it's history!
HungryForChicken, you linked a youtube vid.. dats a no no
wait, intermission?
at least durning the stream
Kandarihu Yet they can't stop the rampant bribery in their own country? Not very encouraging.

Scoot-Scootaloo: We watch Episode Six then It's a Trap :P
Greedo didn't actually get shot
anyother regulars getting dark souls for pc next month?
BUCK!
Han Shot First. If Greedo Shot First, Han would be dead.
3can't do anything about the buffer guys, sorry
the empire lost. it's all these ponies fault. and the liberal's.
I gotta go! bye everypony!
Lil_B: yeah he exploded
otakon: oh ok. thanks :D i like this one
Greedo never even fired
I don't know, because GW2 is released the very next day
I shot first
Bye Dictonary
00,10i see no buffer
3in fact there shouldn't be a buffer
"we brake for no one"
no buffer here either
I also don't see buffer
I had buffer
derpy_pony: And Obama's
SlurryMoon It's better than no movie
and I know I WILL be busy playing that above anything else
SlurryMoon: Can you lower the mst3k ponies just a little bit?
ponibas: Correct. I have the theory Greedo was working with Solo, since Han shoots the table and greedo smuggles himself later out and lives of his collected money.
SlurryMoon: No buffer here
Sumica I'm getting lots of buffer
Im having tremendarous Visual lag, and sound skips
no money right now, also don't think i'll be able to run it also GW2 is calling me more
hahahaha
dat noise in space :O
00,10I see the empire, there ships are triangular
hmm its missing something.... oh right *activates desktop ponies*

Well, screw this movie, gotta prepare for Packing, and then some Rhythm Heaven Fever on my new bought WII

3honestly, don't talk to me about buffering.
:P
lowfn: quiet but fun in space
i hope they fixed the weakpoint this time
lowfn there is atually sound in space they proved it
This is not the buffer youre....
Everypony get ready for one of the greatest memes of all time.......
how bout space balls for a change?
lowfn:they are making the sound theres no vibration in space unless you create the vibration
okay, dat buffer
3if it buffers, quietly grumble to yourself, say nothing
no buffer, but its skipping for me
05otakon: if the movie is a fixed size adn the cutotu is a fixed size, nothign much to do about it
3I'm tired of the complaining
Und dann SlurryMoon was Marvin the Paranoid-android.
by talking or something
I still LOVE those hats!
Bu-
00,10if tehre is no air in space then why is there an "air in space museum"?
/me slaps himself

DARTH VADER!
/me By the way, why do we need Bea Arthur?
Allo ZappyTheUnicorn.
Sumica: the museum is probably empty
because steam always comes out of the hatch once it hits the ground.
/me SILENCE!
LOL
story board movie!!
by choking people
do you guys know the star wars force unleashed? didnt that take place in this movie?
00,10so why are you bitching about the cutout now? it's the exact same one i use.

im pointing my finger at you.
There's always that five seconds of Star Wars or Spaceballs
Is it almost time for Star Wars?
You have failed him for the last time
zappy, its on
SPOILER ALERT: Darth Vader is actually Pinkie Pie :O
ZappyTheUnicorn, refresh the stream. It's already started
ZappyTheUnicorn it is on
ZappyTheUnicorn THIS IS STAR WARS
Oh. Thanks. :D
who drew the banner again?
Wait.. why exactly are they out there by themselves?
lowfn SPOILER ALERT love that quote
05becasue people always gotta complain sumica
Sumica: well let me put it this way, everything you've streamed has been lag free, but everytime SlurryMoon streams these movies this week has been lagtastic the entire time until the end of the movie, then it is fine.
Good night everypony. The movie is unwatchable on my end so I think I will go beddy byes. *Hugs chat*
Who else thinks the emperor is pretty badass for such a old human?
is it only me who finds the sound choppy
Cantina in 3...2....1.....

otakon i think it's your internet, i have no problem at all ._.
"Bring me Han Solo and a cookie."
otakon, so Sumica's streams are good to you?

Dat ultimatum.
Wrek: thank you
are you calling me chicken?
Inb4 someone does it anyway
that looks more like pulled apart
^
why was I programed to feel pain? :(
/me thinks about it
Bronysith......i have a question......maybe it's because i haven't seen it in a while.....but why Leia is Jabba's slave......''offscreen''? I know it was intended that she tried to rescue Han , but it bugs me off
Pfft.
uh...
WHOA!!
oops
Ultimatum, actually, would be perma ban
aww damnit!

Umm

glad to see everyone agrees
Pudge BUT I WANTED FETT TO WIN

Boba finds this acceptable
JESmith71: true
Having gotten bored of WoW and desiring something else to do I might have to give it a look.
me neither
buffering...
dat thermal detonator
Pudge i still liked the battle though
most mmo's won't pop out a trial until ~6mo after release
00,10Ok it looks like mips has some work being done.
This aint STAR WARS.. This be STAR BUFFERS
damnit
i used refresh, and my lag went away
It's very neat, I absolutely love the World vs World part of the game
Dark92Enigma: yeah it was mostly even
I didn't give that a try, was it good?
sumi, weird thing is, we're getting lag at different times
00,10if you are geting excesive buffering try refreshing and hope you get a better conection to them that they are not working on.
I liked it a lot
I used to be a stream watcher like you, but then I took a buffer to the knee.
wonderful painting
Good night everybrony :) See y'all tomorrow :D
$450?
All these keeps and castles you siege, it was brilliant
Pudge: Thanks for the info
good night MaxTheBrony
Boba Fett is the Derpy Hooves of Star Wars
night MaxTheBrony
/me 's headache has been augmented
someone stole my user lol
MaxTheBrony: dream of ponies
If you have excessive buffer, go get a rag, and clean the screen. The circle means it's dirty
see ya MaxTheBrony
90min until Dawn begins again for me XD
Pudge Yeah......but don't make me start on Luke Skywalker vs Harry Potter
<3 :D
11,01It's flashing!

Saw a bit of that on the Escapist review, looked interesting.

Especially when you manage to apply some real tactics, instead of just zerg everything
Mandelbrony: A SPY
Those effects...
/me Eats samwich

/me freezes Sumica in carbonite
Dark92Enigma: okay thanks, I'll have to watch it later
that was the best part of GvG, being the guy sneaking up the back :)
Of course.
NOM
thats not Santa.....
I am a hooker
NOW KISS
WRONG! It was Fluttershy IT WAS TWILIGHT SPARKLE
FouLou oh, I think if it was school-Time I would stick through this :/
11,01I left my voice in a toilet.
imagine the akwardness if she had said that with the helmet on
That doesn't sound right.
Santa?!
That, is your cue to run.
wasnt Fluttershy*
Dat jabba
/me backstabs Eulshy
o u Meanwhile
Ho ho ho ho ho

FouLou ih you can choose your time? neat :)

JESmith71 Obsidian: I was here for that movie, but I dont remember that happening.
Then we rampaged through their walls and took the castle
BAD TOUCH!
Stealth trebuchet is best trebuchet.
756kb/s why cant i load the stream again?
JELLY MAN
bad memory maybe
Lil_B: yeah. And i dont work fulltime since im still studying.
You goan get raped
Pudge: Happened near the end

/me rememebers why Leia got captured.........
lol
/me positions fingers on print screen key
FouLou oh, ok
big chew
it was a long time ago, bro
Lil_B: its pretty need ^-^

Damn Chewy what happened to your hairdo?
needless to say, our server kicked ass that weekend http://i.imgur.com/ZMPD4.jpg
Surprise buttsex

Han certainly uses the phrase delusions of grandur alot
/me 11,01shines SparkleButt
Lil_B: Computer Sience in munich. im almost done
nice
owloysius 4 years..........in STAR WARS movie standars......eons ago
Damn.
We took EVERYTHING
he has the dark side inside of him!
that slave outfit
all it would've taken is one organized team really
slave outfit FTW
with everyone else just wandering around doing whatever
That's all it takes in most PvP tbh.
The original cosplayer.
/me will buy a slave outfit soon
/me POMF
It's when you get two teams against each other that stuff gets fun.
He is now a LV85 Jedi
11,01No maid outfit?
dat wakeup
Darf14: hes a sith
oh SNAP :O
His face
FouLou I wish I were in a bigger city, I would have done Computer science as well, but chemistry isn't bad eather
Luke lukes like a sith lord
looks*
FouLou how long did you study?
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN
What is really neat, is that WvW will be ranked, like a tournament-ish, so the winning teams will fight winning teams
Lil_B: long enough...
therefore, all the good servers will fight other good servers
.... goddammit it figures
That's clever.
FouLou oh Oo
He activated Jabas Trap Card
lol
damn buffer
hes with thrall
I don't know if it's Slurry's connection, my connection or the movies themselves but EVERY Star Wars movie has been nothing but lag for me.
not the rancor pit
IT'S ANOTHER TRAP
3it's not my connection guys
Also, need to set it up so everyone on here plays the same server.
RANCOR!
3it's mips today
Lil_B: im happy when its over and im finally done.
SlurryMoon: it only happens when you stream though.
Sumica: what are you doing in the movie?
indeed
I'm having little trouble
KILL IT WITH FIRE
I was sure Luke was ready for the trap door
Sumica said that there's Mips issues
Dat monster
3a lot more peole are telling me that they have buffer issues
I have zero buffer and I have crappy connection too :(
A neat feature they have, is guesting
11,01Sumica is a Rancor?
Cute!
SlurryMoon: So it's on other mips channels as well?
00,10yeah as i said, refresh a bit and it clears up
nom nom nom
FouLou who isn't :P
so if a friend of your play on another server, he could play on your server, as a guest
I'm having all the issues. :P
11,01Mmm. Pork.
Those squeals that the pig does are horrifying
Hes hungry for bacon
SlurryMoon: sorry, I'm not trying to complain it just happens. I'll stop.
It's a good fing i've seen this movie, i can just peice shit together
Vordox chacke the Computer
now for the dessert
Lil_B: lol
smart
3but I don't think there's anything I can do
sumi, ive refreshed like 8 yimes
He can do everything that you'd normaly do, except use the tradingpost I guess, also no WvW
Lil_B: I'm an educated IT Personal with heavy focus on hardware and Software, and internal Windows Coding and program knowledge
shacke*
It ain't my computer :P
3I live in Texas, if you don't live near enough to me and have a bad internet, that may be the problem
considering they've had 5+ years to plan and polish, it's going to come out very well I think
Calco323 not as annoying as Willy's whinning from ''Free Willy''
SlurryMoon: makes enough sense
Vordox shacke Yourself
screen shotted that
Dark92Enigma: True dat
No Luke use the door
00,10it's hit or miss ponibas
No Luke.....use the back door
00,10I refreshed 5 times and it's fine now.
No Luke......use the trap door
Luke used Rock Throw!
Not The Rancor!!
he ded
its super effective
ded
nooooooo Sumica is ded
No Luke.......IT'S A TRAP
KO
Pffft use the force silly
Luke uses Rock Throw
3That's coming from Sumica, who never gets issues
11,01Impaled.
I've played online with people in austrailia and didnt have issues
3today, mips is having trouble obviously
poor little guy...
Vordox or shake your Cable provider
still not sure which server I want to set up on though, will wait to see the final list
:'(
Diss random scene
:D
:(
all the Emotions
Sumica: why u have giant door impaled in you?
poor fat guy
His only friend is dead
11,01It's Chief Manboobs.
/me refreshes 10th time
It was his best friend
lol
oh my dear little murder monster... woe is me :(
:(
00,10my back itched
mah pet!
:(
I have good connections when anyone other than Phase4 streams.
:(
11,01Manboobs lost a friend :<
Poor Fluttershy-man...
Sumica: what would dick jensen use...
1 refresh = Stream not working. :P at all
That bad huh
mhm
Together again for the first time
00,02Bronysith, dumpster
11,01Bronysith: Dick Jensen's Rod.
just shoot them in the face
I'm thinking of playing on The Far Shiverpeaks, because my brother will be playing there
Vordox Blame flash... because Flash is garbage :P
All powerful? It's a big thing in the ground. It doesn't even move.
00,10kill every one and loot all things Bronysith
Conyst In years
1,000 years of digesion, plenty of time to escape
Luke needs to work on his speech
He will suffocate before 1000 years
ohai Phase4
Kill manboobs.....then he will join him
I jumped in a sarlac pit ones..
WAIT WHAT?
R2D2 is now a bar
once* .. wow
00,10If jaba realy wanted to torture them he would make them go colect the two datacrons .
11,01Rockin' blue elephant.
you'd die of hunger before 1000 years are up
ponibas: and howd it go?
I don't want to imagine the smell of the waste resulted from 1000 year old food...
Sumica: you played TOR?
wOW i have issues
omg.. those datacrons succkkkeeddd
Sumica, lol
lol
Sumica: that game, never again
00,10Yeah
lol that too
indiana jones
I fell to my death.. i got to respawn :p
I loved the Blue elephant Games on newgrounds
Sumica: i played it for a while...then i got hooked on ponies
Pudge: maybe youre fed a bit by the sarlacc
servers make any diference aside from the people playing there ?
PaladinDrakkenwolf, you played TOR?
2 Datacrons, what's that a reference to?
Soon he shall see a big blur blur
ponibas: lol you mean in force unleashed?
ponibas: yeah for barely a month before quiting
have one set Euro and one set NA
Kandarihu, Star Wars: The Old Republic
/me this is MY HOMELAND, motherbucker
Ah, okay
lol
Well, there will obviously be a difference in the World vs World thingy
giant anus in the desert
pirate execution
familiar
twilight_sprinkle, nah, TOR
yummy
Sumica: actually watched ponies for the first time whilst downloading TOR on my new pc. I had a maxed out assassin loved it.
11,01I thought it a Force Unleashed reference (though there was no Tatooine level in FU).
05that creature must swallow one hell of a lot of sand
Also, some servers may have higher populations than other
why does that thing need teeth?
and then there'd be a ping difference depending on where the actual servers are, but aside from those 3 things, not really
ponibas: ah cool. do you like Tor?
MEG? is that you?
LOL
Oh yeah ofc, EU and NA servers.
Those teeth, they don't look like their very well positioned
/me ba dum tss
I like that thing shes wearing for some strange reason... Hmmm I wonder why... ;)
twilight_sprinkle, I do, but none of my friends play anymore.. lol
Nittany_Discord: there was a fight vs boba fett on tatooine, at least on the psp version, it had a sarlacc
A person playing on a EU server could guest to a NA server
so it'd be fine
Nittany_Discord: there was if you kill vader in the first game
Pay back time :)
jabbas boned
/me Nods
Oh that's cool.
jabbas boner
ponibas: they got tired of it?
11,01I'll have to go back to FU.
11,01Been a while since I played it.
wow... I had exactly oine Lego-Model of a Ship as a kid, and its the one Luke is standing on right now... I didn't even knew what Starwars was back then -.-
ker-spin!
Nittany_Discord: force unleashed?
there now ******
WILHELM SCREAM
/me Oh F***YEAH
WILHELM SCREAM
11,01Bronysith: Yes.
Wilhelm.
woot
WILHELM
twilight_sprinkle, kinda started when no one could decide on a side to play..
WILHELM SCREAM
damit, buffer
they really should have handcuffed him...
00,10nooooooo not wukhelm
Nittany_Discord: ahh. you mean god of war with lightsabers...
now look at the mess
what as wilhelm named after?
I love how we are obssesing over the Wilhelm Scream
I think my main toon will be an Ele though
Boba nooooo
bye bye
BOBBA NOOOOOOOOOOOO
lowfn: once you know it you can never overhear one
I will play a guardian
ponibas: kk, im just curious if a friend of mine should try it
Boba Fett, away!
whump
BURRRRRRP
fail
RIP Boba Fett, he died before we knew him
rofl
boba is such a badass...-.-
om nom nom
no Boba don't go!
Ded
fail
Nooo Boba! ..... RIP :(
Go Leia!
00,10what a cheap death for such a cool guy
11,01Into the pit you go.
Boba es ded
he diddnt die
Whatever the tank class is. I've had enough of rogueing.
ill play it
twilight_sprinkle, no harm in trying.. It's free up to level 15 now
There is no tank
I never noticed that Boba just got killed by exident...
didn't try that, but I've never really liked melee classes
/me Bobba Fett: ''I'll be back on the Robot Chicken STAR WARS special''
There is no healers
ANOTHER WILHELM
Dat tongue
There is no dps
red_ony was*
StinkomanFan: Boba lifes. He appears in Jedi Academy!!
No Boba lives
Boba didnt die, altho hes not shown again in the movie
well so far i only played necromancer
that's the great thing about it, you're you, heal your own damn self :3
kinky
WILHELM
omg.. spoilers!
And people think Derpy is an overrated character among fans... Boba Fett had only a few minutes of screentime then died
Oh that's right Guild Wars did weird things with it's classes.
whats the Whilhelm scream?
he escapes digestion
I find it quite awesome
ponibas: yeah but the question is whether itll get old eventually, wouldnt wanna waste money for nothing
I think my brief stint of the original consisted of being an Assassinrangermage.
i see no spoilers
really funny when the giant dragon turns to 1shot the clothy standing too close :3
LANDO NO
nah... applejack is overrated. She has one appearance in the pilot ans gets so many fans.
Its having one heck of a buffet
rape
I played Ranger for most of the original
pudge, not movie wise.. but story line wise
NOOOO LANDO
00,10these gunners must suck at lootship.
Lil_B listen to an overused scream in this movie that goes like this AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaahhhh!
Lil_B: look it up at wikipedia. its a wiedly used scream. its even used in todays movies
she took over the derpy episode with a ridiculous side story
LANDO :'(
lootship.. lol
skip, skip, skip, palys for 3 secs, buffer repeat
No Lando!
will likely have an Ele, then either an Engi or Ranger
"I'm on a boat!"
if i get guild wars 2
ouchie!
FouLou: Dark92Enigma thanks
i am going with what i know best
He just wanted a friend!
heavy melee
I wonder if someone has a fetish for Jabba the Hutt
The classes are Ranger, Elementalist, Necromancer, Mesmer, Guardian, Engineer, Warrior
no the imps, his eyes!
poor Sarlacc
Lil_B hold on: i'll give you a link
trust me I can't see
Did I forget something?
05i can guarantee it
lowfn: That's...disturbing
lowfn: sadly probably so
Thief
11,01lowfn: I'm sure someone does.
i do
MY MECHANO HAND!
well
Thats humans for ya
05everything has a fetish for it
kerpush
warrior it is then
05atleast 1 person in the world
Derpy had a few seconds of screen time in every cameo she had over 52 episodes. Boba Fett had a story-relavent role in several continual minutes in about 6 hours of movie time.
I think someone out there does lowfn
r34
I like big women but not JABBA big
05guaranteed
/me has earned the achievement "I'm on a boat (10 man)"
anything where i get a giant ass sword
or something
Does GW2 have the same kind of mixed-class mechanic that GW has?
lowfn: if it exists...
/me megusta face
tentacle rape and slug combined into one
00,10waht is that rope tied to?
/me is about to get banned
Kandarihu: so it works out about the same?
It doesn't
StinkomanFan: Fat bottom girls make the rockin world go round
it's more based on your weapons
Dark92Enigma: don't do it!
You play one class, that's it
I can fly wait no I can't
ponibas: pffft, not even heroid? laaame
hey hey hey
Wrek well, that the second definition of r34, everthing canm be considered a fetish
otakon, yeah
each weapon has skills associated with it
*heroic
your skills are based of which combinations of weapons you use
lol he ded
Sumica: plot
that reminds me have they chopped off any hands yet?
11,01They blow up over the sarlac?
Noooooo. Max Reebo!
well i guess jabba just gives you more cushion for the pushin
otakon ok i won't........i just have another idea
twilight_sprinkle, we... were in a guild that tried to be both hardcore raiding nad "family style"
Starwars? :D
So if you equip a sword for mainhand, you get three skills associated to the sword
well
DAT SOUND QUALITY
cant wait to try it
Zawan: Eeenope
Bonjour
then there are two skills that's associated to what you equip for offhand
twilight_sprinkle, it didn't work for kicking people out of raids who didn't pay attention or come prepared
Aloa RAWRity
soo we watching ponies watch star wars
00,10good thing he had that gloce just siting there
Hey, RAWRity
Are weapons class restricted in any way?
Hello RAWRity
yeah
ponibas: so much for family style :P
Lil_B: Look up ''The Very First Wilhelm Scream'' on YouTube
Yeah
Yes, luke. Leave your friends to visit Yoda. That went so well the last time.
Hi RAWRity
Hiya RAWRity
Meeeeeh.
11,01It would suck if he got shot in his real hand.
one class can't use everything
dat symphony
evening RAWRity
would make it hard to balance everything
Bojuourourouroruor RAWRity
Yo RAWRity
Hi RAWRity
vader cut off his real hand right?
Hey RAWRity
11,01Hi RAWRity
/me Why do we need Bea Arthur?............................SILENCE!
RAWRity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
John Williams everypony
I like this music
But if you equip, say a 2 hander sword on a guardian, you get a different skillset than you would have gotten on a warrior
:D
this song says we are the bad guys
hello RAWRity
RAWRity getting more hello pings than I ever have
Mandelbrony: Vader lost everything but his right hand, actually
ahh
John Williams ftw
sounds interesting
LadyCanary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111
Why is Pinkie bowing to that guy
^^
I had a terrible day!
but
SIR John Williams everypony
dark souls is going to have my attention
The songs says "Here comes Darth Vader walkin' through the door, he kicked Luke Skywalker 'cross the floor"
with it being hard
Ele has one of the most convoluted weapon sets though >.<
It's Darth Twilight
RAWRity, i meant luke. vader cut his hand off?
Mandelbrony: yes.
dat laugh
No Twilight is Leiah
its yodes
Pinkie is Vader
at the end dosent he lose 5 limbs total?
glad to be back after 4 hours
And fluttershy is Yoda
imagine yoda and pinkie pie hangin out
damn buffer
I found it kind of complex, because of all these elementals you swap between
yoda
05SlurryMoon: will there be more family guy after this? :3
yoda it is
JESmith So, Much WIN
3yes, of course
yeah, and you have to level out each set per element
Today I got to spend 8 hours driving back and forth across town and waiting in long lines, just so I can be sure I can actually pay for school.
3and I have the torrent
05yeeeey!
and yoda just justs sick
No you're not old at all.
gets*
3so it will be a quick transition
yay
900 years old
Lol
Do you have to do that for every weapon
Yoda is 900?
I didn't try the ele that far
Hes almost as old as the Doctor
OVER.......900 years old
900 years old....wow.
yep
does yoda know luke is vader's son?
yeeeey who said that
He's 900 years young.
D'aaaaaaaw
oh my
I think Yoda really is an amazing puppet... so well done
Darf14: I was going to say that :(
Lenghty process I'd believe
Twilight
RAWRity: well at least it's done and you can watch the stream. My net seems to be fighting with Slurry's net atm I can't watch worth a damn.
dat Twilight
00,10dont let wrek catch you then yoda
05the force has kept him alive untill he has performed his final task
"Twilight is upon me"
sorry lowfn :(
he wants to dream of Twi
05to make sure luke has a chance agaisnt the sith lord
Probably to encourage thinking hard about what you want to do.
Get her off then!
oh god twilight why you kill yoda
i hope he isnt talking about the vampire stories
so 15 skills between all of the weapons, times 4 elements
Wrek: Scumbag force.
NO YODA
Hes almost as old as The Doctor
Run from those movies Yoda!
:$
I just stuck to my greatsword and sceptre and shield on my guardian
Yoda will live on in spirit
lolno you aint
otakon: I don't know, my stream seems to be jerking around too. This green guy's lines keep coming out as gibberish.
VADER
does yoda know luke is vader's son?
RAWRity: -__-
only have an axe and a dagger :p
yeah, people will tend to pick a set they like and stay with it
Mandelbrony: Yes
Mandelbrony: ofc he does
;3;
Mandelbrony: eeyup
does luke know yet?
R.I.P. Yoda
LadyCanary: dat kissy face
Does Fluttershy know luke is Pinkie Pie's son?
i never really liked Star Wars
oh lulz, nvm
Mandelbrony: yes, he was told at the end of 5th
Mandelbrony: um that was the HUGE climax at the end of Empire.
dunnnnnnn
not sure how necro will play, it seems they completely reworked the class
Of course Yoda knows he knows all except proper grammar
cHAT DERP
otakon: know, he's asking of YODA knew
otakon: i wonder if it could be called the biggest climax of cinema history
No kissy face, RAWRity. Sad faec
Well there goes my hope of a sword and board necromancer.
otakon: i mean its legendary
05PRINT SCREEN ALL THE BUFFERS
okay
summon loads of minions :D
Wrek: you're getting lag too?
MISSED IT, DAMMIT
Wrek: been doing that
LadyCanary why?
LadyCanary: that's not a sad face. This is a sad face: :'(
Wrek: http://i.imgur.com/00vkQ.jpg
twilight_sprinkle: hmm maybe.
Here come the space cops
I dont have time to paste them into paint before the next one
Mandelbrony don't you remember ''LUKE I AM YOUR FATHER?''
Wrek: I don't have that much paper...
twilight_sprinkle this is no porno
Meanwhile: OMG that perfect!
I wanted a shield or a warhammer damnit.
RAWRity: seeing the :'( face makes me cry
Dark92Enigma, thats why i said 'yet'
Because Yoda
;3;
Eulshy: ew lol...
Mandelbrony: oh.....sorry
RAWRity: How do you do the sad face, anyway? I've been here for over 4 months and still haven't figured it out.
in the original you could literally summon a horde, did it end up the same way at the higher levels?
foreeeever
someone accidentally Mips
wait, you guys are watching Star Wars?
LadyCanary: don't worry. We'll see him again in the prequels!
FUS_RO_yay: affirmative
Darf14: lovely it's not just me!

this streaming service is a little better
/me 11,01thaws otakon
8,6if you're still seeing the mips embed, hit the little blue refresh button
dat greenscreen
What is awesome for the Sylvari is that they are plant people and have an option to have bioluminescence. So they freaking glow in the dark
otakon: It's lagging for me :
:\
yay no lag!'
okay, brb clearing the cache and refreshing whole page
i'm fine. I can see everything.
its streaming better than mips was for me :\
Rainbow Dash has a huge wingboner for these sccenes.
nah the only things that gave my nightmares were Chucky and It
only thing is that the video quality seems a little compressed, but i can deal
no stream?
ThrackerzodREAL: Refresh
laggy as buck
IT. I like that movie.
ThrackerzodREAL: Try refreshing.
inb4 that makes them giant walking targets :p
Vordox: lol

05ethansight: thats whats so awesome

Nittany_Discord worese
stream is still shite though
gives is a mysterious air
Nittany_Discord: Better for me
also, lightIRC is not working correctly for some reason
Nittany_Discord: not much of a difference for me.
otakon: It's skipping like crazy for me
again
05otakon your stream is always shite. its quite a common ocurance :|
just like last night too
streams much better for me
The reason that one died is because he performed an aeliron roll, not a barrel roll.
allponiesarebestponi: MY LEG=Spongebob's equivalent of the WILHELM SCREAM
11,01Seems we got mixed results with the switch.
You gotta know the difference.
less lags would be better though...
IT, B movie?
otakon: just like every night ever
otakon: the gurantee of your interent being bad is just like the gurantee of taco bell
I freaking hate clowns
i think ppl are just trolling.
Wrek: no it's not, it's not shit usually on Friday's, it wasn't shit with Sumica's stream for the other Die Hard movies.
why are stream different? I dont like change :[
NUB NUB
Bronysith: cheap and terrible?
a wild bear has appeared!
oh god wat is that
Pudge: no
first Ewok?
MY CABBAGES=Avatar's equivalent of the WILHELM SCREAM
I hate those little bear thingies
xboxedd: WHY would I waste my time complaining about lag instead of enjoying an awesome movie?
It's a Grunt
Pudge: diahreaa guranteed from taco bell
PREPARE YOUR ANUS
Bronysith: :D
Wrek: i agree with otakon. Sumicas stream is better. I had no problems with die hard
Bronysith: I like Taco Bell, never give me the runs.
SEE?
Dovah: mips was buffering alot for people so they switched it
Oh......god.......

Dovah: That sucks. Mine started in the middle of a game earlier today. Sure hope it improves tomorrow
Rich people

Star Wars Battlefront was a nice game
RAWRity: I guess..it's pretty humid there.

Scoot-Scootaloo used Disturbing Message. It's Super Effective!

JB is a brony?
Scoot-Scootaloo: fuck, i have to stop watching this show
Scoot-Scootaloo: noooooooooooooOOOOOOooOOOOOOoooooOOOpooooooOO11111111!!!!!1111!!!!1!
Why do people keep caring what Bieber is doing?
/me feels ashamed to be in the same boat as JB
too much tawking
Pudge: Apparently >_>
Bieber now possibly made this fandom 10% uncool
Scoot-Scootaloo: Proof?
and breathing oxygen
LOST THE GAME
NOOOOOOOOOO! NOOOOOOOO GOD! NOOOOOOOOOO GOD PLEASE NO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Do we have to love and tolerate the shit outta JB now?
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: 110%
FouLou it does a little bit
Hey hey hey guys? So what if Beiber is a brony? What ahppened to love and tolerate?

IT'S A TRAP?

Barbetos: depends on the person
At least their is now one positive about JB
lol best line
chewie isnt the most intelligent it seems
If not the "haters" i would probably not know who he is to this very day:|
Oh scoots, u so silly
drop*
robot drop would kill them
Why do we care what justin bieber likes, and don't likes?...
Frankly, I like where JB stands on a lot of things, but I don't care for his music. My opinion of him only improves a little bit.

Unfortunately saying it didn't happen doesn't prove shit
Great. That's what you want to hear the interpreter say.
whats with the differant stream
@SuperBrony64: no why would you do that
oh han
11,01SuperBrony64: Trolling?
Stop posting about Bieber, i'm trying to enjoy motherbucking SW::[
eeyup hes trolling
He's divine we must eat him
And then Donkey Kong Country.
Nittany_Discord: isnt trolling a kickable offense :S
now thats a tree house
Ewoks > Jawas
mmm human stew
11,01If JB is really a brony, "Love and tolerance" is going to get tested.
SuperBrony64: Cause this is TROLLING! TROLLING TIME! An hour and a half is just too long for hyperactive minds! WHOO HOO
Squallken: Blasphemy!
I remember the Endor level from Battlefront. Good times...
how did they overpower chewy?
Lol
Nittany_Discord: i sadly have to agree ....
11,02Uh oh...I'm trolling...that's against our rules... D:
Nittany_Discord: Indeed.
wait i was not trolling :(
Nittany_Discord I heard that hes a Brony a Year ago already... I don't care if he is or not though
mods broke the rules! What madness is this?!
Pfft. Love and tolerance is just a cheap tag line. No one really believes that stupid crud.
dat song
SuperBrony64: okay, email bronystate@gmail.com to appeal this

SuperBrony 63, your a mod, you can cheat the rules

Arenanet made a brony reference in their recentmost video!
SuperBrony64: no wai

C3POs Face reminds of the machine -Human in Metropolis
That's no moon, it's a GANMEN!
Mandelbrony watch Sonic Adventure 2 then if you want to see a moon blow up
Random fact: They didn't know if Harrison Ford was gonna play Han Solo again, so they froze him in Empire

if you have the first game, if you make a character with the name it reserves it
for the first 24h after launch
um
huh offline?
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUN
What if a dude dated, married, and had kids with some chick, and he eventually found out she was his long lost sister?
the broadcast is offline for me

Eddmario: someone did
inb4 servers overload can't access for 3 days
otakon: Refresh
But she ends up sucking at the Force :D
Eddmario: it was weird

You're crazy!
THere we go, just hit the play button
lol
"Oh really because at first I thought you meant C3PO"
otakon: xD
incest? incest
this stream service is just aweful
Well, since you had to have two word or more names in GW, nobody has one word names reserved
Even when you kissed him?
otakon: Really? I remember hearing about someone who didn't know his wife was a dude for almost their entire marriage
(pause for dramatic effect........) DUN DUN DUUUUUUN
Oh yeah, I liked that.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PEICE OF SHI- i..i..i mean the stream
Eddmario: well there was another where the guy was related.
Actual naming convention instead of "Macgooberfour"
And my mother knew it........
We have two refresh buttons right now. The button on Veemi, the button on Bronystate, and those of us who use external IRC clients can safely use the button on our browsers.
HungryForChicken: refresh
HungryForChicken: Refresh
sick
not like it matters
I think they've planned for that actually TheGreatAndPowerfulT :p
there i had to use a new name
bc goddammit STILL LAGGIN
is there a 'shit' equivalent for ponies?
http://i.imgur.com/4pTOp.png
Press the big blue button that says "Refresh" under the stream
oh.. thanks otakon
Guild wars names have always been quite more on the role play side
diablo try to plan for it :p it did not work
Mandelbrony: Shoot
otakon: It's smoothed out for me FYI
Mandelbrony: or hay
Lil_B: lol
fun fact: the blue button and f5 do the same thing thanks to javascript
Lil_B: :D
WalkerPony89: yeah it's still lagtastic
/me has more faith in ArenaNet than Blizzard at this point

for me anyway but hey, it's always just me
Lil_B: danm that was fast
Random bit of trivia: Harrison Ford HATED Han Solo
/me i feel sexfual attractiher toward my brot
owloysius, F5 is a bad idea for anyone using an embedded client.
do they say 'bucking' in the show?
why is my original name not working
ehhh probably you are right
Hi everypony.
Hello BlazeAngel
Mandelbrony: Only when referring to AJ's job.
considering they halved the number of servers from the first 2 beta weekends, upped the number of players, and still had no major issues?
i know.
Zawan I see no reason why it should have taken long :/
ATAT
/me I feel sexual atrractions toward my brother (fuck my keyboard)
yo BlazeAngel
Eddmario, they need to change that
question ? do the character i made last week stays or i have to make another ?
Oh hey look
have to start over for the launch
WAS THAT SO HARD TO SAY
?
An even LESS practical place to use an ATAT
You must start from scratch
Dark92Enigma-RED: I'd see a therapist for that...
that's the usual way of betas though
Lil_B: its just that was your first reaction
shit dood
Dat mole on his face
Hey, kirzstryfe, you there?
shoot did
11,01He had a rod.
Eddmario I'm mocking Leia, bro
Dark92Enigma-RED: I'm not really into keyboards
allponiesarebestpony, wait for your nick to time out. Then you can switch back to it.
I had a level 55 guardian after the second beta weekend
Dark92Enigma-RED: *that's the joke*
Also, impound his ship
What's the max level?
they wiped the server I played on the first weekend >.<
80
Gutted kirz.
thanks Kandarihu ill just use the for now
Point lightsaber Directly at son's face
owloysius i was mocking Leia, btw
11,01I miss when this was cool before the prequels.
i know
...The stream lag is just messing with us, picking the most hilarious moments to pause at
Vader isnt such a bad dude
So son... lets repeat all the Father-Son Activitys we couldn't do over the last 20 years
Um yeah...... lets not bring up the past. Too many bad prequels.
wasn't too bad though, was only in mid-20s I think, was enjoying it and not trying to power level
A neat thing is, there is almost no level curves
and I had work
so every level takes about the same amount of gameplay
FINAL BATTLE INCOMING......
jar jar
and there's not much dead time with all of the side stuff going on
EPICNESS INCOMING
why does everyone hate the prequels?
DA POWAH
can just play and have fun, then hit level before you even realize it
Obsidian: Unless you're counting the newer Clone Wars as well, then there was only 1 bad prequal *cough*Attack of the Clones*cough*
JAR JAR
I got to level 15 in PvE
PsychoticDoc: Most think they aren't as good as the old ones.
then I ONLY did WvW after that
PsychoticDoc, two words. One of them is Jar and the other is Jar
they are all good in there own way people can just chill

I mean come on people, you cant beat the pod racing scene from ep 1
can you?
11,01Jar Jar gave Palpatine complete control of the republic.
Kandarihu: Dont forget the "midichorians"
It's a real cool thing, that you could actually level from 1 to 80 solely from playing PvP if that's what you like
Does PvP grant xp?
yes
SirGanjalf: probaly made of ewoks
Pudge: Don't forget the epic battle at the end too!
Episode 1 is still the only Star Wars Movie I own
^
I always hated PvP in WoW.
Everything is Jar Jar's fault
And Everyone is bumped up to max level to make it more fair
Here comes the scene where Han cops a feel
The PvP in GW is awesome
Eddmario: that was good too. I mean really if you get past Jar Jar it's a solid movie
Theres always a back door
Pudge aside from the bad announcer commentary
0,14so can we blame Jar Jar and not me? >.>
Secret entrance fun
11,01Secret.
it's always been max level, difference is skills and skill
'secret'
back door fun
11,01SaxyPretender: Maybe.
It looks it. I think the objectives is what makes PvP fun. WoW PvP is too small.
Its a Secret for everybodu
A "secret entrance"
We all hate Navi from OOT and that game is still considered the best game
Scret Back Door Fun
Giggity
FouLou: Good, because Wookies are a bit CHEWY

I hate my computer -_-

0,14also, that sad feel when they were supposed to have made Battlefron 3
If they get stuck in a body, they do a lot of damage to the internal organs. It's entirely possible that a Stormtrooper's uniform is made out of a material that can repel blasters or all kind of commonly used weapon. If, by the complexity of the material's design, it's useless against arrows, so be it.

Shizuka Again, including the fans? (like myself)
0,14we;ll have battlefront 3
13it doesn't even stop their own blasters much less a low velocity arrow
dont give in luke
Hi SaxyPretender. How you doin?
Darf14: That reminds me, I hears that Nintendo was working on a Star Fox/Metroid crossover
Inbound BEST Lightsaber battle ever between Father and Son...
DONT GIVE HIM YOUR FRIENDCHIPS
*heared
SaxyPretender: one day...
Shizuka: yeah I always noticed that, why have the armor it it doesn't even work to stop glancing shots?
Why would killing an evil man make you evil, the jedis killed a lot in the prequels?
pew
He caved :(
Maybe the Stormtrooper armor is only useful against the vacuum of space, then.
Tarzan Wookee :D
that tarzan yes
mitamaking: It's because he's killing in anger
oh I heard of that Eddmario , I am still having a hard time believing it unil I see it with my own eyes
dat Tarzan
Tarzan-
Tarzan in cannon
*yell
Nittany_Discord: tabfail
Nittany_Discord: wrong chat?
mitamaking: They never killed for revenge
inb4 best lightsaber fight period.
otakon: Because they wear armour made out of hopes and dreams and harsh language.
Not bad. Had Press visit at work today and got 2 free days now.
Shizuka Um.......everyone in the Star Wars Universe are idiots including the fans? (sorry for asking three times)
I want those hats
Eddmario: Darth Maul
Meanwhile: like my net?
brb
11,01Sorry.
otakon: Your net doesn't even cover the hope part.
uhm, couldn't you shot him?
0,14XD
mitamaking: They never killed him for revenge.
13and if it DOES, it's a blaster projectile with some mass (as light only would exert no lethal force) and small size traveling at extremely high velocity... if the armor blocks that but can't block an arrow traveling at many magnitudes less speed and a much larger surface area..
dat tab fail
That AT-ST is a SPY!
Poor AT-ST
MY LEG
dem legs
Eddmario: What do you call that Obi Wan did to Maul?
otakon: In a fight between your internet and a stormtrooper, for once, the stormtrooper would win.
light still produces heat
mitamaking: Killing him because Maul was a SITH?
insane with inspiration
11,02Wookies liek Cookies :D
13ja but this is visible light
lasers dont have mass, yet the can kill
Too bad he wasn't crushed by that fairground ride last week really Shizuka.
13infrared generates heat
lol he ded
Eddmario: Why couldn't he do it before his master was killed, he did it with anger
that cartoon logic
Ewocks really like ........ socks
I wonder what does AT-STs would count as at an I-Pass area...
Boom! Head strangle xD
Here comes Tom!
11,01Infrared is hear really.
Dem logs
Poor AT-ST
I hated Logs on Star Wars Battlefront :3
11,01*heat
okay how much did those logs weigh?
The stuff the ewoks are doing would work I think
how does it explode?
Why did that explode?
fail
Curse you logs!
11,01My brain is broken again.
3why does everything explode..
derp
13why did it explode just from falling over
Meanwhile: no idea
13moreover, why can't it get up?
SlurryMoon: Baynium
11,02They should really remake these movies.
13it's a dumb design
Wood! My one weakness!
yes he got it...
11,01SlurryMoon and Shizuka. Because movie.
Shizuka: They wanted to show off with their budget
SuperBrony64: BLASPHEMY!
Yay
SuperBrony64: joking
The AT-STs have the same flaw as that robot from RoboCop: Can't use steps
Shizuka: Movie physics
xD
Shizuka: things always explode when they fall over ^-^
Falling over had to be a consideration in the design of those damn things... Why would that make it explode?
Also, Han just copped a feel
dem lines
~yay~
That yay was perfect!
Oh youSB
D'awwwwwwwwwwww
Shizuka because they were carring explosives and nitro in it?
<3
I dunno
Shizuka: Same reason fruit stands always show up in car chases. Movie logic. Fall over = Explode
lol wookee
13i'm totally overlooking the mst3k mantra as our border ponies would have us but come on guys
chewie to the rescue
13admit it, star wars has issues :3
What was his idea?
This is the best Lightsaber battlle ever
11,01In Goldeneye 64, everything exploded when shot.
A lot of issues.

Back from amh shower
11,01Tables. Boxes.
Those are some pretty elaborate traps for an impromptu change of plans after the main plan failed. Ewoks sure work fast.
11,01Everything.
Shizuka: I honestly think you and the other mods should do your own commentary(audio) for one movie.
Wb Ponies47
We know, we just dont care that much
Shizuka: It's a series that sarted in the 70s. EVERY movie back then had issues
11,02Star Wars: A New Hope 3D
Nittany_Discord: no, just the barrels, i think
13someone tell vader his lightsaber isn't in his hand
TrixieMuffin: yh same thing I was thinking.
otakon: HOLY HELL FUND DAT SHIT
otakon: But shizu can't speak.
Obi Wan has taught him nothing, it was all Yoda
0,14SuperBrony64, it's happening
Meanwhile: she can go robot OR we can pitch in for a microphone for her.
13latter won't work
mitamaking: Vader doesnt know that
Shizuka: why not?
otakon: she'll say no anyway. Deal w/ it.
do lightsabers have handguards?
Luke: I have the high ground!
Dat backflip
SuperBrony64: Well, when Phantom Mennace 3D was announced, they said they'd do that with ALL 6 films...
Shizuka: just use a voice changer dear.
to be honest, 3D makes me crosseyed :P
Yes.. Vader... use your hatred...
0,14as in they're planning to release all the SW movies in THREE DEEE
But we won't get IV in 3D until II and III. Booo!
SaxyPretender: NOOOOOOOOO
At least the lightsaber battle made up almost everything <--------
11,02Someone should tell the two of them that those lightsabers are just effects added in during post production, they aren't really in a 'To-The-Death' sword fight.
damn you lag!
This isn't a bad good vs evil discussion
13hm
13that needed more railings
Definitely.
Yeah they're really hitting each other with reflective sticks
indeed
JESmith71: Episode III would be awesome in 3D. 3D might be one of the ony ways II can be redeemed.
13course they have a bottomless pit over there without railings
3D is shit.
FINISH HIM
Fire in space?
13osha's already sued six times
Shizuka: ofc!
lightsabers need hand guards
11,02ZE RAILINGS, ZEY DO NUTHING
SuperBrony64: good one
lol
Hi Wedge
i thought Star wars was in Chronic need of more railings
whats the railing thingy anyway?
SuperBrony64: how can the railings do anything , when there are none
MORE RAILINGS, MORE RAILINGS!
3D has been shit every time the industry has tried it, and it's shit now. I can't wait for it to die.
Isnt is supposed to be pylons?

Nittany_Discord, what if he makes massive changes to this movie, movin the entire battle to Kasshykk and changing the Ewoks to Wookies?
its a carp
Trolol
Ok... this.. is the best scene ever of the film
didn't they see the dead members lying in front of them?
One wonderss what happened to those prisoners
Kandarihu: That would be BAD?
Now does he say NOO or DARTH?
3oh yes Dark Knight Rises
Im supprised that its juggling 3 different fights very well

05his nuts are cookign shizu
13this scene really needs vader yelling no
Und dann he threw him down the vent.
Thats what he gets for not installing more railings
I always wondered why the Emperor just didn't turn of his Force in when he's falling :/
11,02Emperor: "ZE RAILINGS, ZEY DO NUTHING"

11,01Don't kill Luke. He's so radiant.

His only regret was that he was going to die.

Yfw people use that skeleton shot to figure out the extent of Vaders cyborgishness.

I LOVE THIS TRENCH RUN!
Hi everypony
hiya OtakuTom
This level is hard as heck in Rouge Leader
Hey OtakuTom
I remember this level from Rogue Squadron. It was such a btich :P
13right men, our last death star blew up, this time make sure we have enough space to run a star destroyer straight to the reactor
Just in time OtakuTom
>first Death Star has glaring weakness
Hello OtakuTom
Hey OtakuTom
Goddamn I LOVE THIS SCEN!
hi OtakuTom :)
13just in case
This trench run is a good improvement to the other trench run :)
Otakon: I Love this trench run on Rouge Leader, though the level itself is hard to fly through with the Falcon :O
>make second Death Star with an even bigger trench
Darf14: agreed
ENGINEER FAIL
i love how they scream in pain when they explode
/me leaks
CriticKitten: actually it's longer but smaller
11,01Shizuka: No covers installed?
11,02Darth Vader: "We're rebuilding the Death Star from scratch...and you still add in the same vulnerability as last time?!"
Well this isn't really a trench, this one is still being built and has a massive exposed part.
there goes the dish
NOT A SCRATCH
Well, It was in the blueprints...
SuperBrony64: lol
/me cracks his neck.....by accident
Yea, I remember doing this level in Rogue Leader...the outside of the Death Star was easy, the tunnel/trench was a huge pain.
13they wouldn't possibly try the same tactic twice
okay there goes the radar
The shield covered the weakness
FIRE EVERYTHIGN!

Wedge is awesome. We see not enough of him
Hence why they had the shield

It seems to be a rule that the minimal cup size of anime/manga females is a C cup, unless the character is supposed to be "flat"
ah! looks like mips is back
DixInfernus: You haven't seen Eiken have you? =P
I said "minimum"

DixInfernus: true
Dat Maria is going to grow up to a proper lady
Mentally scarred
Vordox: Eiken just goes up to the wall of moderation and shoves it over with boin-force
I googled up this "Eikan" thing...my life wasn't the same.
DixInfernus: True. But I prefer the older animes, where breast size =/= character =P
dingdingdingdingding
VenHur96: Try to avoid...random words unless you pre ask about it. XD
ding ding
Vordox: before the Well... There's Lupon the 3rd... Didn't the females in that series have rediculous F+ cup sizes?
Last good example was probably Pokemon/Digimon, before the Boobie Era started big time :P
Lupin the Third I haven't seen yet sadly.
SuperBrony64: Shall i make you some banana on toast?
I had seen sparse episodes on toonami.
accidently closed the chat XD
I just noticed... Is he called.... Captain Nemo?
But Outlaw Star wasn't boin-a-licious. Unless you count the US banned episode.

Hats DO benifit you ingame
11,01TheRandomkid321: Swag?
Vordox I onyl wanted premium and though the High five was pretty neat actually.
lowfn: how so
TheRandomkid321: because you'll be loved by your team? :P
Good morning everypony.
Nitanny_Discord Isnt that an acronym for Secretly We Are Gay?

11,01Vordox: Aww :<
/me noms on SuperBrony64's ear
TheRandomkid321: Yeah, Bambi got whacked, DAYUM son
11,01I was starting to enjoy them.
yeah makes sense but I'm sure that they have some sort of vet
Vordox taht wasnt me...
YOu barely noticed them! Even if they took 50% of your sight away.
Imma go eat some cereal at 12:28 AM cuz I'm lowfey like that
11,02My ear feels funny O~O
anyone here got minecraft?
That's not low life, lowfn
...I have this curious desire for an Ambrosia apple.
Cereal is delicious... Almost as delicious as sandvich
That's just hungry
lowfn: thats natural
Vordox: I said lowfey now lowey
Thought you meant lowlife
Sorry
11,02Dr-Hooves: I, technically, have it
lowfey is describing something to be similar to lowfn
is it a cracked version?
Dr-Hooves: I do...
Aaand how would people know this lowfn ?
Anime again? Wow.. You'd think this place is ANime State... I know it aint just ponies but damn there is ALOT of anime.
I think I'm going to change my name to nips
Vordox: Idk, Cuz my names lowfn?
:$
TheRandomkid321: YEAH, who would have thought people who LOVE A PONY CARTOON would enjoy OTHER cartoons?
;)
just curious, this is based on the book right?
superretroworld: INdeed
Vordox: theres other cartoons than ponies? :O
:D
Plus the fact that we're kinda between seasons right now, so there's not really much to show.
Vordox I just aint a big fan of anime... it aint that bad but... A little feminine at times... Look whos talkign someone who watches a show about pink, talking ponies.
noname: surprising right?
OtakuTom: Inded.
k, then i better not watch it, i think the book will be better
TheRandomkid321: Ironic, ain't it?
/me goes downstairs to eat cereal since hes lowfey like that
TheRandomkid321: Ainme has ALOT of tastes to offer
ha
Depending on your preference, you just need someone to help you find your choice
Vordox It's just too random for me... I dont really like random things...
HatchetRyda: impossible, I can't accept this.
We should watch hellsing or berserk sometime.
Shounen, Shounen-Ai, Bischounen, Eechi, Boke, Seinen, etc etc.
There's anime out there that isn't random.
TheRandomkid321: What do you like for stories?
TheRandomkid321: Genre wise?
oO.o
DAT EPISODE NAME
OH SH*T
Oh wow I thought someone would point out me not liking randomness and y name being Random kid... Vordox I like comedy and action.
TheRandomkid321: Comedy and action...
What comedy?
Comedy and action...hmm...
/me 11,01puts Vordox in lolita cosplay.
Vordox Australian comedy...
I missed the episode name.
/me strikes a loli pose.
Went to grab cereal.
TheRandomkid321: An easier way of identifying it? :)
DixInfernus, the episode title is Run Marie Run
11,01Vordox, you are so kawaii.
Vordox an a## load of swears...
You mean moe, right?
TheRandomkid321: Ass load of swearing casual comedy wth Action... Hmmm...
dat brushing
HOW ARE THYE TALKING LIKE THA- Ugh I'm fine absolutly fine...
What do I feel like BECK Would be a godo choice...
But I think it's TOO real for your taste. :P
OtakuTom: Indeed, I think TheRandomkid321 would enjoy casual story, probably crime related.
11,01I don't think we could stream P&S due to content.
What about seriousness, TheRandomkid321 ?
Vordox Yeah my favorite book series is like that. Kinda
Figured so much TheRandomkid321
Its got an even ammount of COmedy, Crime, And Seriousness
But got any ideas, OtakuTom?
11,02Uggh...vegetarians...
I wasn't suggesting for stream. Vordox and I are thinking of a show that TheRandomKid321 would like to (hopefully) change his general opinion on anime.
11,01I read about the show. Seems very NSFW.
I would eat it
TheRandomkid321 is too "innocent" to understandd P&S
Yea, probably not...lol
Vegens...
that's a lie
11,01It's me as a kid.
Vordox I bet you not...
So far, Comedy, Crime, Serioussness.
TheRandomkid321: Trust my sense of anime. :)
What abotu supernatural, TheRandomkid321 ?
Dat deer grave.
^
hmmm...I wish I had my anime catalogue with me here...I've got a veritable buckton of it :P
Vordox Urr not really.
ping ping ping
Di-di-ding
Gotcha, that removes quite a few.
Wait... she scowled at the little girl... for making a grave?
OtakuTom: Crime, Serioussness and Comedy...
quadriple ping!
DIDIDIDING
OtakuTom: Closest I can think is Seinen version then.
How about Case Closed?
Dat pissed off wranger
(Detective Conan)
Souless
Case Closed, you mean Conan?
11,01Entertain Minime.
HOW IS HIS LEGS LIKE TAHT!?
OtakuTom: Aha. Might be, But I think it's too "kiddo" for TheRandomkid321
It took me a minute to remember the japanese title
So now I've jumped to the other end of the maturity spectrum :P
Welp, g'night everypony.
I think I'd recommend Baccano to TheRandomkid321
OtakuTom: Even if it contains detective and murders, It's a good start, Shounen brings the action, and there's Crime, minor comedy...
Night Meanwhile
Vordox The books I read have graphic murder and sex scenes in them ;)
OtakuTom: Actually, it may be a good start. And the anime is also going on atm.
Though I can't really consider 6:30AM as night...
TheRandomkid321: I know... Give him that suggestion then. :P
11,02Title theme drop.
/me is back, he was out of damn milk and is too lazy to buy some so he just drank some water
Meanwhile: close enough :P
SuperBrony64: It's still a good song :P
11,02Aye :3
MOOOOUNTAAAAAAAAAAAUGEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
OK. I have no idea what this is... but what the hay is Captain GLoval from Macross doing in it?
pointless montage... Uh... Huh
Kencolt: Geesus how old are you Ke...Oh right :P
TheRandomkid321: It's not pointless.
hahaha, that's what I was wonderingsince last night Kencolt
pointless filler
It's a 39 episode series, there's bound to be some filler
^^
You people think this is a filler? XD
inb4 relevancy
Vordox yes... Bet seeing how you are probably an anime fanatic...
No I think the camera panning to the sun is a filler
OH WOW!
11,01Aww. The little maid hurt herself :<
TheRandomkid321: Anyway, Me and OtakuTom recommend Detective Conan anime. :)
I'm sure it's got relevancy, but I'm just stating that there's bound to be filler at some point if it lasted 39 episodes.
NOT DANGEROUS AT ALL!
It has the genre you may enjoy TheRandomkid321
try watching inuyasha and not getting pissed off about filler
LAWL poor King
CHEW CHEW PUFF PUFF (spam it x9001 times)
Vordox I bet you I wont but eh..

Hello Vordox.
Alpha-Omega, how about Naruto? About half that series was filler (before they did the jump to Shippuden)
Shes going to go the wrong way
TheRandomkid321: I guess OtakuTom may have a good place where you can view it, TheRandomkid321

I'm trying to think of where it would be available...
Vordox I only hate anime because my worst enemy loves it.
OtakuTom: anime44 has a pretty good selections
What show IS this?
00,10you would think she would have notice things like that
I've never been to anime44
11,02And now this entire episode is them walking and singing...it's not a Disney movie everypony.

Vordox, what do you think of Shikabane Hime? Not so much comedy, but it's got some great action.
It's been how many hours and they -just- notice the missing kid?
If you're going to recommend that, Shikabane Hime, what about Gunslinger girl?
Oooh...Gunslinger Girl was great.
Smart Samson :D
