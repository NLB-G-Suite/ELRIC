Barbetos|AtWork: EXACTLY
I've been to busy with chat and not paying much attention to the movie
Thats it?
pot80: me too /)
It seems that chat is more interesting than the movie
DerpyMuffins: And since he's a king, that's pretty much the most important thing he has to do.
you'd be surprised how hard it is for people to speak publically
DerpyMuffins: Isn't it alaways?
always*
but im gonna pay attention to the next movie ^^
rdibp|evil: (\ yay first bro hoof

I'm liking the dissonance of the music
DaringDerpy no, the war started when germany started their attack onto Poland without stating the war upfront , thus making the first move still
Dken2021: nioe, just feel like being evil today>:3
uh oh
Sirens!
Jumping frowards a bit aren't we?
you know....I kinda want to see a parody of the speech where the king's word is being replace by Commander Boreal
Lil_B: this was a regional conflict, it became a world war when britain and france declared war on germany
TITLE DRO[p
Ahh! he said it!
Oh yes! This part!
"But while there's moonlight, and music..."
fuckshittits
I'd like to see speech where every noun is replaced with vagina
I love this part.
oh god yes this scene
._./
DaringDerpy well, in that case we leave it at that, for me it's just one war which started with the first movie
CrimsonPheonix: why? what happens?
DaringDerpy: Still it would escalate sooner or later
just watch
Isn't the only function of a British king to look nice and to hold warm speeches? What is he so nervous about?
Just imagine the entire British population in their underwear.

in need of a new computer myself :/
08,01Sumica: <3
Wait, if he had4 a speech problem, wouldn't they have at least practiced with him when he was a kid, especially if they knew he was going to be king?
You know, Lionel should just start dancing.
That'd help Berty.
exactly
goody for you
So he just muted his pings? Thanks, Sumica.
That'd break the tensino Kammerjunk
and 'LIttle Mix' should start playing
ASoftFluffyThing, the title was about to go to his brother
tension*
ASoftFluffyThing: He wasn't going to be a king
and everybody should breat into dance
00,10ASoftFluffyThing, he was not planed to be the king
They didn't know he'd be king though. His brother abdicated less than a year after taking the throne.
ASoftFluffyThing: his older brother was supposed to be king
00,10he was the younger brother
ASoftFluffyThing: Plat holes, plot holes everywhere
ASoftFluffyThing: His brother should be a king
Satrun: something`s wrong about you, but I cant get my finger on it
Ohhhhhh.
ASoftFluffyThing: But then he divorced and ran
so faaar awaaaaaay...
I do like this piece, very soothing
That's not a plot hole, that actually happened for real.
did guys
Or what if all the pings he got were delayed instead of muted, and we hear them all in rapid succession when the speech is done?
dizz guiz
Thanks SirGanjalf, Sumica, somepony_else, rdibp|evil, and CrimsonPhoenix
and here's the brother
Brother Douche.
Kandarihu, Fluttershy overload

His brrother is the Douche of York:P
*brother
mmhmm
but they had to make it film-worthy D:
Kammerjunk, then be gald taht the brother didn't become king ^^
dat epic music
what I don't get was why exactly did his brother abdicated to be king
Hey, no smoking, solly!
Will it be the full 9 minute speech?
<.< yeah gald. gald > glad
he convicted millions of young people to death on the battlefield. very glorious
CrimsonPhoenix: cause he wanted to marry a slut
what I don't get was why exactly did his brother abducted the king
CrimsonPhoenix: he wanted to marry a divorced woman, which wasnt allwoed for a king
dat Winston

I know, it's terrible.
One of the only "Good" movies out these days.
7/10. A superbly acted and shot film, with some very good writing. However, it suffers from its very, very dry tone and does little to really impress upon the watcher the stakes of him overcoming his stutter.

that would really hurt, since it's melted rock
...dem lava would kill any pony
...
Present the ass!
00,10all the adult dragons are like "fucking kids"
CrimsonPhoenix: :O

The path of shame and farts...

Also you can't sink in lava.
CrimsonPhoenix: *GASP*.............THAT.....that was COSMIC

Sumica: Especially because dragons live so long.
PARTY HARD
Nittany_Discord it is melted rock after all

NO YOU DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!
And rd cares why?

FOREEEEVEEEEEEEEEEEER1'???
and u b like i ment 5 ever
dragons party soft
:O
if you swim in syrup you are as fast as in water. guess that applys for lava too
Spike: SCREW FRIENDSHIP! I HAVE DIAMONDS
Nittany_Discord, actually there are many different kinds of lava, some thick, some very much liquid
all they do is eat a lot
Everfree forest
FOOOOOOOOREEEEEVEEEEER!!!!!
they didnt even get wasted.
Barbetos|AtWork: loyal friend :P
00,10I went on a dragon raid once. I won the roll for the mount.
Yeah
Sure.
Whatver.
dat raid
head smack
whats wrong with that dragan
Rd is the element of RD.
Malmortius: Then again, he IS "in the moment" and doesn't know that Twi and her friends followed him.
...Dafuq
i guess you are gonna MISS the dragon raid
Sumica: You kill me.
o rly Sumica
ok i dont see the problem so far they havent been all that bad
crackle flying
no wings Spike
WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU AND THE MARE WHO RAISED YOU AS A CHILD????
wait, spike, you should be equipping youself before the raid
fabulous costume
rawr
Hoof it
Twilight doesn't use her magic enough :(
Rainbow Dash has a sudden concern for Spike in this episode
lol
Also, Derpys legs
needs big fire breath and wings in S3
Dken2021: Spike level 5 man.
DAT PUN :D
Phoenixes
level 5, man*
<3
isnt that the pheonix from se 1?
I mean, she lifted an ursa minor and a giant metal water tower
superretroworld, nope
phoenixes!
:O
they actually look different
kill them spake
:[
Ho shit son!
00,10the the phoenix boss sucked on that raid
ded
hes ded
S3 needs more phoenix
slaughter tham and bathe in their flaming blood
superretroworld wild phoenixes, the one you saw is own by celestia
00,10noting to tank
oh my
I think Philomena would still be Celestia's pet. These are wild phoenixes.
:O EVIL!!!!
oops...
twilight didnt teleport because she didnt know the area or where thry were going
oh
Dark, dude.
hello again
couldnt she levitate herself mi9000 ;p
:P
well, levitate the 3 of them
I am selling pony scout cookies and was wondering if you wanted to buy any.
Beware the troll phoenixes
^
"You may hate him, but you have to admit... Dumbledores got stlye" XDD
Malmortius, levitation requires energy depending on weight
Phoenix fire can leave burns on dragons that can swim in lava...
36 pound Phoenix.
lifting three ponies by magic is a lot
Harry Potter approves
solar flare
the light!
TAIYOKEEENNN
Phoenix used flash. It's super effective!
Trees. What are they made off in Equestria?
alexxm GET THE TABLES
Oh there's that Dusk's Dawn fan ep I talked about
MY EYES
SOLAR FLARE!!!!!
solar flare
CrimsonPhoenix: but twilight in another episode lifted an ursa minor and a giant water tower ;P
Kaiyo wha??
SOLAR FLARE!!!!!!
moltress lived
yaay
Malmortius: She probably thought it wise to preserve her energy.
FUERA ABAJO
Malmortius, and you saw how much energy THAT took?
And it damn near killed her.
true, true.
Smash it!
.....WHY
she also didnt know where they were going or the area
SMASH THE PRECIOUS!
NO
And I THREW IT ON THE GROUND
dragon used smash
he wont
Hurrrp Durrrrp
I THREW IT ON THE GROUND
She even had to stand completely still due to the force of the magic
dat peer pressure
in this episode, they teach kids that its wrong to kill pets
not
isn't the purple one supposed to be out collecting clow cards?
NO
SAY NO TO PEER PRESSURE
WAT U SAY
this is kinda wierd why do dragons hate pheonixs
time for Rarity to be bad-ass
PUT EM UP PUT EM UUUP
dem ponies
dat rarity
00,10I like this one https://dl.dropbox.com/u/105398260/buffer%20stahp.png

Dken: Taiyoken is basically the original japanese name for dbz solar flare
No means no bra
that Rarity defense
HOOF EM' UP!
Rarity sure is a lady.
lol @ rarity
doctor_whooves127, they don't. they are just douches
The moral of the episode is not to have egg sandwiches
EPIC RARITY!
Sumica: :D
Rarity's a ride or die pony
;)
"ill rip you to peices"...umm...
im more into fashion, BUT ILL RIP YOU A NEW DIAMOND HOLE
Rarity has nerves of steel
rarity is superior
YES
...
Run
i dont normally stand on two hooves but when i do IM GONNA KICK YOUR ASS
And then Twilight threw a ball of plasma at the dragons. Roll credits.
pony_300 oh, sorry, was making a dbz abridged joke
Lyra`_combatmedic: That's terrible. :D

MONTHY PYTHON moment

00,10OP twilie is OP

rarisquel
And then, Spike was still level 5.
grouphug
what was this sound?
D'aaaaaawwww <3
OOOooOO
Malmortius: Maybe it only works if Pinkie tugs on her tail like a gattling gun
Spike left AJ's blanket behind
they would've been raped if it wasn't for twillight
SPike lost 10% of his XP from running away
left out Spike at party again
"i am the daus a macharena" -twilight
i hate that picture

CrimsonPhoenix: For now..........

Malmortius, vote for it for the next lotterly
Lotto yay!
MI9000, well that was a episode late in the season
What does Peewee even eat?
AJIsAwesome, we say the same with tank
AJIsAwesome: ya, the one where theres a pic of spike ripped out and pasted witht eh mane 6

Oh, BaconMane.
All right, follow my lead
Ponies47: I face the same problem.
/me panics
I have no problem finding an A film, but I can never think of B films we haven't already seen.
00,10ok then we will show both parts of a two parter after the B movie
00,10so you all get 3 eps this week
0,5:)
I can think of a few
Surf Ninjaz
*ninjas
thats your B right there
00,10inb4 every one picks two parteres next week
Pony episodes are easy. Nut movies not so much :I
08,01hehe

It only got 5.9 on imdb? It's official, internet ratings are useless
I love how after his initial shock, the professor completely accepts without question the fact that he now has three children who can fly and have laser vision.

You know, to Jojo's perspective, he may very well believe he really IS making Townsville a better place. He's faced nothing but discrimination from them ever since he was smart enough to care. Now he's thinking of how to help them.
And no one realizes what theya are doing

And thus, the Professor turned into the comical character from the PPG show.

BUt even with the antidote... he still retains his freakish intellect, for later episodes.

Dear Princess Celestia: Today I learned that every problem can be solved either by cursing and swearing loudly, or by application of violence. It doesn't matter if you're Pre-WWII Britain or a trio of little girls. Your faithful student, Purple Prose.

NOPE
oh Lauren Faust,you wonderful,wonderful person
http://ponybot.net/?i=2862
also, can i suggest 5 episodes of the orriginal doctor who as a B movie?
needs to see Blazing
...Yeeeeaaaaah...I can understand this movie is the B movie due to being a box office failure, but... *sigh*
Lauren Faust did a lot
Additional Character Animation

dive bomb
Cheerilee was in the library in Show Stoppers

AJ
yaay
damn it my mom is up
11,01The plot has spoken.
See? rarity cares
DAT BOOTYBUMP
wow
why do people always say rarity is a bitch
asssmash of friendship!
Malmortius: *shrugs*
What a coincidence
there was a removed party episode in S1?
I WILL NOT RARITY
http://ponybot.net/pix/2309.png
malmortius: that will be demonstrated later in the episode.
for Equestria!
bewm
dam, rarity
lasor
ALIFLY
Rarity is best friend!
nice one azuredragon
wait, no intro?
Malmortius, I don't know, she's best pony in my book
DERPY
what no there was a party in the 1st ep
gd
Malmortius although she is the element of generousity, people feel like she uses ponies to get what she wants
:P
douchbags
Yep, rarity is my favourite pony too.
:P
pony_300, she actually just got over herself in this episode
Rarity is best
dat tail whip
GINERS
she dies
Sumica, no intro? ^^
gingers
And we're all a bit materialistic :( Rarity cares when it matters
yes
lol
got a problem with us gingers
Fluttertold
Booo
cartman does
That guy sounds like nelson
/me yawns
HAR HAR!
I'm betting season 3 has a rainbow getting kicked out of flight school ep
100,000
HA HA
gg fluttershy, gg
damnit fluttershy
fluttershy stahp
wait if rd did a sonic rainboom and is the only one who can do it... Why are they saying she can't!
REMEMBER OBAMA YOU FREAKING WINGED HORSE..."YES WE CAN!!!"
I thought that too, first time I heard him. It's not though - Nelson is Nancy Cartwright.
hi everypony :) who won the lotto??????'
CrimsonPhoenix: which is also ignored, yup. I think of Rarity as the rich bitch you find on sitcoms, if they hactually gave a shit about anything other than themselves.
flootershai pls
oh flutters..
dont hate on fluttershy
wow,Fluttershy is evil
non belivers
Malmortus: he IS nelson
pot80, because they didn't really get to see it
dem wings
HNNGGG
but rarity doesn't care about anybody but herself
butt wings ^^
so epic
:O
SMASHING
ok what i think the first ep of seaons 3 is they will have to rescue like princess celestias mom aka the quenn
Hi, cachi01. Can't remember. I'll let you know when it gets posted. :)
Wii
Buytoast: nope
NYAAAAR
Nintendo Wii
*queen
pony_300, yeah that's quite a stretch
et ready for drama
WAIT JUST A SECOOOOOOND...ARE THOSE WINGS ON HER FLANKS!?!?!?
...
hi hasbro toy
and if Rarity was rich she would be in canterlot
Buytoast: you misspelled rainbow dash
11,01They're almost attached to her butt.
and now felix baumgartner
L_Y_R_A: No.
Buttwings.
HAX
hiu
sorry,Pegasi,but you're obsolete now.We got magic for that!
cartwheel
they boht don't care about anybody else
:D
it's why they're the worst characteres
*cough* Butt Stalion :P
how did she learn tp fly so face.....
fast
Even with magic, Pinkie would still be able to walk on clouds. :D
*without
Part of the spell, I guess.
Unicorn is OP
^
ooooooooooo
If twilight can make ursa minor float, why cant she levitate herself?
that woa
RainbowAsh: But they were in the race where rd did the rainboom on another race?
seems like lyra learned the same spell also
*episods
WHOAH
Skyra.
unicorns are the master race
Malmortius, have you seen how much effort she put in that?
i dont get how twilight doesnt magic herself with wings one day?
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f4c6MGTL_2Y/UHngIJebEDI/AAAAAAAA8hM/tzevNArkCzc/s1600/1.png I WANT IT NOOOOW
Malmortius, again it takes a shit load of energy
modern tools canon
cant wait for the YEAH!!! moment
twilight_sprinkle: you misspelled pegasus
but ursa minor was huge compared to twilight ;p
cachi01: how? unicorns can do everything
uh oh...
another ping Sumi
in other-words...THE FILLY KILLING ROOM
wait only on fanfiction so were are good
incoming fun
Malmortius, so Twillight will levitate herself CONSTANTLY during the WHOLE episode?
CrimsonPhoenix: she has ambitions to be a part of high society, hates getting dirty, loves fashion, definitely wants to be rich and successful. She's just missing the "treat people like crap" aspect and instead cares and does things for others.
WOOAAAHH!
"Weather" Factory
twilight_sprinkle: but.....but pegasus have.......uhmmm.........wingboners?
back in a sec gonna get a sandwich
and next the rainbow factory
But levitating the Ursa was pushing her into the ground. A weightlifter might be able to lift more than his own body weight, but that doesn't mean he can lift himself off the ground.
Front line on the morning paper: Pony dead. Cause of death: Falling jack hammer.
twilight_sprinkle: "Anything you can do, I can do better. I can do anything better than you."
thus, a not-Rich bitch!
he drop that...Later that day some earth pony died
that rainbow pun
cachi01: but unicorns have horns ;p
pot80, two of them were in the same race, but one crashed and the other was thrown off track right before the rainboom
SPICY
Spicy!!!!!!!!1
them are big snowflakes... as in Baman and Piderman :D
Spicy!
taste the rainbow, motherfucka
SPICY
dat horse sound
08,01DUN DUN DA DA DA DUN DUN
08,01DAAA DUN DUN
Mega_Milk: :D
08,01DA DUN DUN
DAT FLUTTERPIE
08,01DA DA DA
TASTE THE-...Damn it pank.
twilight_sprinkle: Le me abandons thread
boy pony_300, you keep defending the worst pony
what a shame
lol cashieoh-wan
twilight_sprinkle: No, they can't. For example, Unicorns are notoriously bad at farming-- as are Pegasai. The technical term for a farm run by unicorns is desert, and for one run by pegasai is swamp.
uhhh DORK!
I'd taste the rainbow, but it's too hot to handle
oh yea and sometimes she can be self-centered.
RainbowAsh: ok just wandering :P
sometimes?
J_E_Smith71: Oh, you. :P
Kencolt: what about the eps when twi used her magic to harvest apples
you spelled always wrong there
Spoilers: eeeenope
twilight_sprinkle: Harvesting ain't the same thing as growing.
All the other ponies are too perfect, i like rarity because she has an obvious flaw, she can be self centered. But she really cares for her friends when it matters.
dumplings are good :3
Buytoast: heh. I like a bitch who's ready to throw down with the best of them, and is not REALLY a bitch. :p
pony_300, I guess, but if you want me to explain my view on Rarity I would just give you a chapter of a fanfic cause it reflect everything on how I thought about her
bwa haha
Rarity pls go
WA HA HAAA
wo hahaha!
WAHAHA
but she really is a bitch
Dat laugh -lol
Malmortius: only twi is almost perfect~
I love you Tabitha
so much
Rarity you show off
those rarity noises
Buytoast, naw, she isn't
granny smith
Her laugh there was epic
Granny SMith in heaven
dat granny smith recolor
yes
aren't they wondering why she has a horn AND wings?
Kencolt: well maybe, but i suspect they can spawn food anyway
lol a Balloon

If you just got the ability to fly, wouldnt you be a bit excited too? You people think one flaw makes her scum. Jeez, shes a little showoff-y, chill.
i like her mane
k thanks
WORST RECOLOR EVER GOES TO...THE PINK CELESTIA TOY!!!
twilight_sprinkle: Canon hold it as opnly Earth Ponies can successfully grow food-- at least any that's worth a damn. And Twilight Sparkle, is, after all, something of an aberration, most unicorns have no-where the capability she does.
Satern: so true
Dat Spitfire.
L_Y_R_A: amen
but it's an incredible flaw
XD
08,01AJIsAwesome: i do, yeah
that's why she's the worst
Malmortius: but shes rubbing it in
I like Celestia...
CrimsonPhoenix: reading? NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU! Srsly, I do remember the days when I used to love reading fanfics but then I grew out of the groove...... but maybe my developing ADD has something to do with that...
Shes not rubbing it in on purpose.
Dr Whooves
nomnomnomnom haaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
doctor who pegasus
dat Dr Whooves voice
Much on that hay Doctor
pony_300, most likely
umm...when did he get wings?
doctor whooves is easily confused
dat caramel

Leeeeerooooooy!
DERPY
WINGKIIIINS
The Doctor must have been doing experiments on himself to get them wings
which is a shame too cause what I want to share gives a lot of insight in personal life and all
derpy woohoo

This is the only episode i dont like rarity, too much make up :(
twilight_sprinkle: We've seen enough to identify the exceptional from the average.
A bit too much there, eh Rarity?
FINGERS
08,01good thing there's only one of her
Malmortius: WAY too much makeup. :D
08,01other wise, there would be
RAINBOWS ONLY FEAR...FAILURE
Makeup, you've got some Rarity on you.
08,01*sunglasses*
08,01a jam of tarts.

OH hell

youre gona go for kid
hit?
Kencolt: well twi is obviously excpetional, but i dont think weve seen much of average unicorn abilities
yes
:/
humans canon
Can I be honest? I think Rarity looks ugly with all that extra unnesseary makeup and clothing on.
Damn those douchebags
^
05been watching bullshit all day :|
ASoftFluffyThing: Agreed.
She just overkilled overkill.
but that's her inner personality showing
ASoftFluffyThing: you're right..
Applejack2012: humans have been in equestria on g1 tho
ASoftFluffyThing: I feel the same. And she i smy second favorite pony -lol
11,01Wrek watches Toilet TV.
08,01Applejack2012: it was pinkie pie wearing it, so it may only be canon inside her head
why the long face? i dont even know
Then stop watching bullshit and watch ponies Wrek :3
08,01which is perfectly reasonable
Nittany_Discord: its a good channel
There goes rarity ;)
08,01as she is medium aware
Wrek: You watched the twilight movies?
Nittany_Discord: bulls dont use toilets though
1... 2... 3...
lets play with ponies!
boom?
have you ever seen it when a child finds makeup and covers herself in it to imitate their mother/girls in magazines? its like that. Chill.
and now for the moment that convert most people into the MLP fandom
not like that
ASoftFluffyThing: Honestly, I think almost every sentient being looks horrendous with too much Make-up
05no... penn and tellers bullshit
anyone seen guiles theme version of this?
By years she means untill the next ep
shes just went overboard :(
Rarity = Icarus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus
srsly, that lipstick is abit much
11,01And then her wings fall off.
free fall
CrimsonPhoenix: this one? i thought it was when that piano fell on twilight
CrimsonPhoenix, tbh, the photo fnish episode did it for me .__.
yay
shit just got real
ohh no
i am falling down
08,01der[pu!
D34PY
08,01*derpy
derppppppppppy :)
I say most people
you dont say
TAKE THAT YOU ****
der[pu
Iwa, I know. But Rarity obviously doesn't know the meaning between normal makeup and OHMYGODSCARYCLOWNPONY makeup
Applebuck Season had me hooked.
save us Derpy
XD im not even a quarter short of electronic funds for this game i want >.<
In this episode at least
i bet celestia did that, she didnt like how Rarity was posing in front of the sun
I started with Appleebuck Season too
in your face!
DAT MUSIC
Nooo, Spitfire. :O
dramatic music
epicness imanent

RAIN...BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM

SONIC RAINBOOOOOOOOOOM"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Nyan Dash anyone?

http://fav.me/d49ui4u
00,10and now we wont have to see another sonic rainboom for months and months
hey guys, shes about to do the sonic rainboom!!...oh and rarity might die
TASTE THE RAINBOW MOTHERFUCKER!
look at their faces
we certainly need a celestia-focused episode season 3
also SONIC RAINBOOM!!!!!
applause
SONICRAINBOOM WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
:D
08,01there was a great fanfic i read about this episode, where was an alternate ending where Dash didn't do a rainboom, and Rarity and the Wonderbolts hit the deck and died
11,01Until Cutie Mark Chronicles Sumica.
LOL
Sumica: Unless Canterlot Wedding gets played
Well Sumica that's good since it's a rare thing
Rainbow =D
Sounds cheerful...
jaw breakers anyone?...to break the ja...nvm...you broke it waching the rainboom...
08,01the fic dealt with the aftermath
YAY
08,01and the guilt
Sumica: oh thats right, and we watched lesson zero ep recently too
Saigneur: whats it call
lol the yays
awesome
there you go guys, dying is canon
I have a disaster fic of this too
R41N B00000000000000MMMMM
Yay
yay
Sumi
I DID THAT TOO!
yay
08,01Invi: reasonably long
08,01VenHur: it was, yes
STOP SPAMMINGYAY NUB
See? Rarity is nice :(
I did hate how they did the Sonic Rainboom in the wedding
08,01thelonepony: i can't remember
.......eh she still got nothing on sonic
why would you want to read that?
UPWARD INSTANT RAINBOOM
why didnt the butterflys catch them in the fic
08,01it'll be on fimfiction somewhere
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG!

thanks

ineverhadthismuchcoffeebefore
08,01at Galacon, i got a kiss on the cheek from Swedish Spitfire's VA
Talk Swedish to me, Spitfire. ;)
Hello everypony.
lesson zero was the only other ep with the rainboom right? that means no rainbooms for half a year
whats the name of the third wonderbolt?
me jelly
OHMIGOSH
as any mod even read Background Pony?
OHMIGOSH
OMAIGOSH...TOO MUCH FACE SPAZMS
CALM THE BUCK DOWN NOW
08,01Invi: i was
that S3 reaction
08,01for galacon
twilight_sprinkle: on the royal wedding one she did it again
twilight_sprinkle, what no
She did a Rainboom at the wedding too.
Alchemist: Fleet foot Spitfire and soarin.
twilight_sprinkle there was also Cutiemark Chronicles
Sonic Rainboom in 3 episodes
for saving your lifes. and for doing an impossible trick. i present you with this invaluable plastic piece of shit
08,01Invi: there's always next year!
BEST DAY EVA
Yes, but that was in flashback.
SEE? IM DETERMINED TO MAKE PEOPLE KNOW RARITY IS NICE
08,01Thrackerzod: i has none
if theres one in chronicles and wedding, then thats 4 eps
best.wedding.ever
suckups.
08,01you'll just have to take my word for it
Those two have no more friends.
This one with the title of the same name, Cutie Mark Chronicles, Canterlot Wedding Part 2
but yet she still cant get into the wonderbolts./
I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going
08,01oooooh my
eeyup
if you know what she means
aaaaaand rejected
inb4 sex jokes
3some?
we all knowhow that ended
so she gets along with soarin
ice cream
yeap Brony_Pony26, RD got Rejected
what now
there never was an ep with rd and the wonderbolts was there?
wow...someones hitting on rainbow dahs...ON THE SHOW!!! (heart breaker...)
sea ponies?
There's a fic detailing that day
fraaaaaaaaaaaaaaancis
O.o?
I think the reason i like rarity the most is because shes the most balanced pony. Fluttershy is generally shy, rainbow dash is boyish, twilight - levelheaded
Thanks for another great movie night!
yay
what now
That was a good movie night guise...
08,01Bromany: i've been to Kassel and Stuttgart, and i've done an internship in Ilmenau

OH GOD

Fluttershy, in World of Ponycraft is a Restoration Druid. Her reason is partly because she likes to heal her friends-- and partly because when she gets enough levels, she can finally be a tree.

compare the two...then think of anger management class...
You want ponies? Either go to youtube or keep asking for them.
05the "i got a disorder or some ortehr crap so you should expecy my disrespectful behavior"?

13protip, if you want ponies on demand, go to youtube
The worst part about PPGZ IMO was what they did with the RRB
I had my downs but i never came close to think about suicide
Geesh...L_Y_R_A really need some chill phills once in a while.
(-_- it wasnt an ad...it was telling evryone why i wont be here...)
Hey everyone. So, what were the lottery results this week?
/me "This is you" throws a trantrum "I WANT PONY!"
L_Y_R_A: we give no fuck
See? You look like dumb.
Which was advertising the channel, L_Y_R_A.
BoroBrony: yeah my gamertag is cow224 we should play some halo sometime or when i get gold right now i dun have it gonna have to bye a card but i thought halo odst was pretty good dun no wy some people gave it hate
Azuredragon, what's that?

What's what?
Or, y'know, you could just go away from your computer and punch some pillows.
AJIsAwesome: its L_Y_R_A not us

Azuredragon, what did PPGZ do to the RRB?
That works for me.

L_Y_R_A: if you are bored, watch NGE
cachi01: do the air molecules represent the number of fucks? cause if so, thats a lot of cusk

Colt_Brovakiin: I love that gif :D
cachi01: :D
cow334: I know. But it's BECAUSE of L_Y_R_A that we're becoming a little irritable.
twilight_sprinkle: lol

13L_Y_R_A: Not appropriate. Behave or be gone.
Mega_Milk: SOmetimes he doesn't.
cachi01: Haha thanks :P
DocSane: Don't worry...I have two things in mind...

That's right. He wanted to stream some Planetside 2

It should be post now :|
Twilight is best plushie
[SWAG]Haku: alexxm won it

That plushie
I'm so Jelly
00,10Screw space north koria BoroBrony
But I'm thinking of fasting on gaming once the IGG Marathon is over.
tails doll iis best doll
BroPony|MEDIC: not really, but at first i was excited about being a brony and told everyone in chats, but i dont think i ever bragged
What server is Wrek on?
Bronysith what was his pick?
[SWAG]Haku: kung fu something
Hustle?
Panda?
Panda 2?
[SWAG]Haku: hustle
have the same shir, just in grey
that's as much as 4 10s
*shirt
Bronysith Kung FU HUstle? As in one of the funniest movies ever?
kung fu hustle FTW
Ooh, Planetside!
i love that movie
So who won the B movie pcik?
isn't kung fun hustle the televisio show based off of kung fu panda?
no
No. :D
What server are you on Wrek?
No :D
Buytoast: no thats legends of po
superretroworld: Well, everyday outside of chats on what not, im always being accused of bragging about how im a brony, just because im seen with mlp stuff, or heard watching mlp and it really irritates me how they think im a homosexual for it, and i just dont understan the problem
Kung Fu Panda is the show based on Kung Fu Panda
ah yes, Skype groups
what's that infernal beeping sound
I find the show meh, IMO.
Yeah, the show isnt all that great
the kung fu a
panda show is bad
The movie's good, but the show's meh.
Dreamworks Dragons is a pretty good tv show based on movie
thankfully, dreamworks was able to develope a game based off their box office smash Fat Animal Proves His Worth
i dont like the awnser meh
they caled it World of Pocraft: Pandaland
Buytoast: :D
:D
BroPony|MEDIC: there is no problem, just because you have mlp stuff doesnt mean you brag, bragging is pretty much talking so much about it, and idk why they think your homosexual, you just ended up in a bad place, so dont worry
You know, I actually thought the WOW: Pandorica trailers were the trailers for KFP 3
Dat twi plushie :3
Yeah, me too
although mists of pandaria seems better than cataclysm so far
monks are fun as shit
superretroworld: Thanks /)
Is this Border lands 2? XD
got to be going bye every one
Buytoast so not very fun?
[SWAG]Haku: So your secretly gay?! D:
BroPony|MEDIC pretty common for people to be like, "lol gay" @ mlp stuff.
BroPony|MEDIC: no problem (\ :)
I am a horrible pilot in this game
Wait what?!
fine, fun
Heh. I wouldn't mind join dat Skype call

MilkyWhiskers: haku already explained what his swag means lol

Hi otakon who is now 17
Buytoast: seems like an excuse to not have to defend him to me...
Who won lottery?
Thrackerzod: what is it?

And what won lottery
No one won lotteery
[SWAG]Haku ah yes, that was like a childhood of mine, watching stick videos and whatnot

Buytoast: you have to prove a truth first
hi LunasGuard :)
twilight_sprinkle: kung Fu for A?
This game looks like it needs a story mode...
and dare I say SeaNanners
Buytoast: I've never heard of the guy, so I cant agree that its truth
DashWithRainbows: I love Robbaz :3
Good boy.
Your so-called "truth" is nothing but an opinion. I don't believe you. Elaborate.
ello Dken2021 Colt_Brovakiin cachi01
Sumica: Know what won for lottery man?
hai LunasGuard
otakon17: surprisingly, yes. when i tried it for B, they said it was A
twilight_sprinkle: Woah
otakon17: check the site page
he's basically some unfunny leech that hates any game other than ocarina of time and praises old games and hate new
and the good ol DoctoDoctorWho
Welp I'm out for now

Buytoast: he might just review games he doesnt like, a lot of people do
whats the name of the server?
cachi01 you mean they aren't D:?

NOOOOOOOOOOOO
So guys, I dont want to boast or anything, but I just broke my record for number of days without dying

Bronysith: you really like linking that leech right?
Hi, zacksters. :)
Cameh_Dude, I would like to know as well >.<
if only i could find that video
LunasGuard: is that a good thing or a bad thing?
planetside 2 (?)
it;'s bascailly him saying how sonic and metroid prime were terrible, overrated games
ya
you never know
among others
and by sonic i mean the first sonic
DoctoDoctorWho: its good :)
D:
i was rainbow dashie but i must have been on a different server 6_9
XD
Buytoast: but i thought you said he liked the old games and hates the new ones
he praises ocarina of time
but he doesn't like all old games
he just think's they're superior
and i found the video
Who praises what?
So what is up?
Nothing much.
Just Wrek playing PS2.
PS2?
Still read that as Phantasy Star
oh god
Planetside 2.
i dont really care about ol dgames, or many new games. i just think hes funny, and he seems like an ok guy
i forgot some of the ones he hates
hmm
Or Playstation
*old
LunasGuard: I care not how many traitors invade the internet, I will stand tall by the sun goddess's side.
:)
jontron believes brawl is the best super smash brothers
twilight_sprinkle: Same.
For the New Lunar Republic!
because it's the newest one
Buytoast: I agree
Buytoast ...so far
It has the most characters, the most modes, and I like the play style
DoctoDoctorWho: u do that /me fly away
Buytoast: As much as I would like to agree...melee was better
/me fly away
no it's not
Now SSBW(World is my guess for the next one) will likely be better
my iPod just died :(
it's not the newst
so it's bad
It's been awhile since i played melee
I MUST GIVE IT CPR!!
The NLR will be crushed under the might of the solar empire, and luna apprehended for her heresy.
Buytoast: huh?
If only Melee was compayible with LAN.
/me lickels [SWAG]Haku
Buytoast: *hipster glasses*
that's jontron's argument
...
What is wrong with 4 player Melee?
Bronystih
WHy woudl you lcik me?
it's not the newest one
Brawl is the newest one
[SWAG]Haku: you taste of strawberries and chocolate
oh, and he hates metroid prime because it's "too open world"
/me 11,01dusts Bronysith
Is this a Game Grumps video or JonTron video?
weird, I dislike strawberryies
jontron
one he deleted because he realized how wrong he was
I am not a fan of Metroid Prime either, but I recognize the game for what it is
^
and tried to do some damage control
<-- Getting increasingly skeptical wether Buytoast is sarcastic
Buytoast: well he hates new stuff who dafuq cares? everyone has their opinions
i suddenly got addicted to jontron now
^
Bad Horse is only horse Haku knows of
Ponies do not count because they are ponies and not horses
dat Twi Plushie
jontron is pretty hilarious, although his humor can get old pretty fast if you watch too much of his stuff
let's see, i forgot what the 2 most ovverated games are to him
hi
oh
hello CCCP
twilight_sprinkle: That is my opinion of Zero Punctuation
Hai CCCP :)
/me lands on cloud
[SWAG]Haku: I think horse is a derogatory term for ponies
Goldeneye and Link to the Past
hi sonicdude558 Colt_Brovakiin
well then
Hi, CCCP. :)
Goldeneye is overrated
mitamaking: never heard of him
Shut up DDW
hi AJIsAwesome
ohai CCCP
11,01Wow. I quieted Bronysith.
hi twilight_sprinkle
Buytoast: everyone has their fucking opinions. and yes goldeneye is overrated
eh, I don't mind Jontron, but since he's a "internet reviewer" I don't tune into him that much
Nittany_Discord: What? How? Teach me of this power!
i believe all his goldeneye bashing is about the multiplayer
Ohai CCCP
Goldeneye, DEFINITELY overrated. Link To The Past, not so much.
hello AdamTheDuck
perfect dark was nice
Goldeneye is as overated as The Lion King
ello CCCP
hi Dken2021
oh god, this is too funny
"Why is Goldeneye bad?"
Link to the Past is a little overrated, but only because people worship it as the GOAT
"Because it's old."
Golden eye wasn't that bad.
what game is this?
11,01Don't know if you can handle it GilDash.
man, jontron is such an enlightening and interesting fellow
a legend of zelda cant be overrated because they are already 10000000000000000% awesome.....well except for 3 games..................
Planetside 2.
Nittany_Discord: Tsk, try me. ;)
Dark CLoud?
CCCP: I know right :P
I wish I had Planetside 2 :/
^
GilDash: but "that would be telling :p"
Goldeneye had bad graphics for the N64 if you ask me, bad controls, and really the multiplayer is overrated
/me hugs Colt_Brovakiin
watching two streams at a time :D
cachi01: Out of curiousity: Which?
i'm going to bed
Night, Bromany. :)
have a good night everypony
night
Goodnight Bromany
Iwa: zelda adventures, faces of evil and i forgot the name of the other shitty cdi game
night Bromany
man, the jontron worship brigade is out in full force
what a shame
LttP, really I don't care for it, but I am not a up-down view of Zelda fan
night Bromany, have fun in a dormant state for 8 hours
Same here, this game looks awesome and my laptop is to shit to run anything :(
11,01GilDash: Eat lots of grapes. You can't lose.
I don't even watch Jontron, I just agree with him on Goldeneye
Nittany_Discord: Grapes? Can't I just drink grape juice?
what couler are they?
I only eat Green Grapes.
typo
If they're Purple forget it!
11,01Grape juice works, but you'll only get 80% of the power you need.
Colt_Brovakiin: if it cant run doom. then yes u r probably fucked
boom
"Man, I need an opinion on something. I know! I'll agree with whatever JonTron says. I am so enlightened now."
what?
^
Haku must take his leave now everypony
/me is sad
Bye, [SWAG]Haku. :)
I don't even watch Jontron
bye [SWAG]Haku :)
Bye [SWAG]Haku
Good night, good morning, good evening
bye [SWAG]Haku
Bye [SWAG]Haku
nice seeing you [SWAG]Haku
bye [SWAG]Haku
I just had a power flicker :(
I come back to talk of grapes? Nittany_Discord, GilDash, what?
Nittany_Discord: That's okay. I can eat the rest.
This game has some pretty smexy graphics I must say
Panda: Oh, Holla! :)
ERHMAGERD GREIPS R MAH FAEVRITE
Hai Panda :)
This game looks like what Battlefield 3 promised to be
dat joystick
then buffer
hello agaim panda
Blue Angel designs
mfw when battlefield 4 releases next year :/
again*
/me waves
Your so "Wrek-less"
Declination of stream is saddening...
That airship makes me moist
As entertaining as JonTron can be, there is no way that I agree with him on everything. Take Bubsy, for example. He hated the game. I loved it as a kid and I still do.
o.o
Well, the SNES one.
Isn't Bubsy that cat thingy?
Not the PS1 version. :D
mitamaking: Yep.
NO NOT THAT BOBCAT
ALL OF THE MUSCLES
I WILL KILL IT WITH MY BARE HANDS
It looked so weird
FROOOOOOOOOOOGGY
cachi01: Big the cat?
Why is that Twilight Plush sitting there next to him the entire time!? XD
YEEEES EVERYTIME I HERA CAT I THINK OF THAT BASTARD
hear*
I wuv Twiley :)
I can't buy a plush they all so damn expensive
sad sad sad sad sad sad
Do you have a eject button?
dafuq wrek
GIMME 20 DOLLAHS
so...anyone up for a battle in pokemon?
I know :(
GIMME 20 DOLLAHS
NO WIFFIN IN DA CLUB
Dken2021: White 2 or Black 2?
i srly don't get the hype in TF2 about hats... i just pulled one out of a crate, and i freaking hate it. could have been a strange weapon, but noooo... a hat
cachi01: GIMMIE 200 DOLLAHS
mitamaking black 2
In order to get a plushie..I need....I need...I need about Tree Fitty
Dken2021: *brohoof*
Tree Fiddy
mitamaking /)
dang loch ness monster
I need about Tree fiddy
Eli: one does not simply question the hats
If I had internet I would
DoctoDoctorWho: i hate hats. except for my own. that one's cool
oh, ok then
Eli: MAY I TAKE YOUR HAT SIR?
God... I can't take my eyes off that plushie
I play some TF2 and I don't get the hats either, then again, pokemon fan
cachi01: well if you give me something for it, sure
That plushie makes me want to jump through my monitor into his room and steal the plushie
Eli: i will give you my pride
But I'm not Pinkie Pie I don't possess those powers.
caus el shitbos wont run TF2
shitbox*
cachi01: eww. i don't want that
Aren't most hats just cosmetic? I know you can combine some of them with other apparel and get special benefits, but not for every kind of hat.
Somepony should make a tf2 parody using fullmetal alchemist
AJIsAwesome: do you have TF2 now?
Nope.
AJIsAwesome: aww...
Yeeeeh!
I'm going to have so many adventures with Twilight.
DoctoDoctorWho: I guarentee it has been done
NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yo but I used a clone machine :3
YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSS
1.21 GIGAWATTS!
More twillights for everypony
cachi01: do you have TF? i don't think i have you yet
yay
guys. any cool doom wads you recommend me?
My school has a 3d Printer XD
It's a shame that that PPG/MLP fic is on hiatus
Eli: my steam is cachisebas. if not its cachi01
NOT THE $TH WALL
4TH
I would spam codes to it
:D
Eli: but el shitbox wont run tf2 so pls wait a month till i get my new pc and we will play :)
The 4TH wall is the money wall when it comes to Pinkie
I would make a plastic Twilight form then paint it XD
*down
cachi01: sure, no stress
Ryunosuke, I didn't know a $th wall existed. WHERE IS THIS WALL OF MONEY?
They need to do Ponies at like Build a Bear
Or something XD
Dken2021: dammit
I meant 4th wall :)
Or take a Wal mart plushie and modify it
mitamaking: I have yet to find it strangely
Ryunosuke: I know :)
Dken2021: any other cool modded wads? something like megaman 8-bit deathmatch?
I WANT MY MONEY
team deathmatch!
cachi01 sorry, that's all I know of
Man that Twillight smile is great
He be wearing sunglasses like a boss.

So...anyone's excited for Skyfall?
VenHur: Yes. So, so much.
Eli: all of them is me
I might see Skyfall, I haven't seen Casino Royal or Solace yet
idk, movies suck nowadays
dem polygons
VenHur: wouldn't say excited, but i'm gonna watch it
Eli: i played portal 2 in my cachisebasUSA and cachisebasMEX account so i think it created a steam account lol
sonicdude558: that's bull. there are always some good ones in a ton of shit
psn account
I have an idea, for our Asian friends, we should do a Children's movie night sometime in April.
cachi01: so i'm just gonna add all?
I think that's when Kid's week is in Japan
Eli: yeah sure if u want to
kids day is always in april
oh mai
/me goes back to Wrek's IP, uses his clone machine on the Twi Plushie and hugs it for 5 minutes
cachi01: *not sure if i just made 3 friends or just one shizophrenic :P
xd
We can hold a lottery similar to what we do for our Bronystate movie night, only this time we choose what Children's movies to play
Eli: the problem is that i made my PSN account back when mexico wasnt in the country list
Rating limit is G and PG
Eli: so cachisebas is my EspaÃ±a account
must... Barf...
cachi01: it says mexico tho
What do you guys think?
Can't... Resist...
night guys
Eli: but i can only buy in mexico mexican psn cards soooo i created cachisebasUSA for some betas and cachisebasMEX for buying stuff
brb
j/k
Night, alexxm. :)
I didn't actually bar-
Eli: cachisebasUSA and MEX were made because i played portal 2 in them
/me barfs on the chatroom
dont do that
please
Eli: cachisebas was created before portal was released
cachi01: information overload
Are you kidding me, sonicdude558?
lol
This one guy told me on a IRC that he kills bronies for a living, I said "Oh so that's why you're homeless."
They told you not to do that, sonicdude558.

He's getting a lot of shit on the IRC XD

O-O
Ya'll crazy.
:D
..........
What can I say about this one? The animation is fantastic, the soundtrack is awesome, and the story, while engaging and action packed, can drag for too long at times,As for the characters, theyâre overall good, and spot-on like the show. but for me, the one who stole the show is Mojo-Jojo. My God is he a tragic characterâ¦.a good one. You canât help but empathize with him, even if we know heâs going to be the villain. But then again, that
:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D
:D
hi LadyCanary. Welcome to random plus stream. But mostly random. And stream.

Dark92Enigma: It cut off. :)
THE FUTURUE
FUTURE
You two have plans together Allegr0?
FUUUTUUURRRRE
:D That was worth staying in tonight
xD
So how does this movie hold up? Personally, I say it holds up very well, and Iâm not saying this because I love the show, but for how dark, serious, and intense it was. I guess itâs biggest crime was dragging for too long, like an extended episode instead of a movie. Not to mention it gets a little predictable if youâve grown up with the show (since you mightâve knew what was coming), or too aggressive, dark and violent if you havenât.
Woah much text
Why is there so much text?
Dat text wall
told ya.........bye
FUTURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRE
