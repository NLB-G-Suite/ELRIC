Badum0tish
lol
Nah, of Roger Rabbit :-)
...
Disney is buying out everybody these days. xD
:D
6i bet
Disney and Warner Bros both collabed with this movie.
yes I know, so mature
Hhmph XD
Sterling example of humour, there.
Lets hope disney doesnt buy HUB
yeah
6Who Likes RolePlaying?
ikr
dem brooms
they will
:P
they own hasbro
BronyDarth: NO PLEASE
Canebridge: Ah, Roger messed up his lines and Eddie's trying to solve a case of murder.
and hasbro owns the Hub
it is only a matter of time
...Damn it, living in a world with co-existing cartoons would be the GREATEST LIFE EVER!
Moo
BronyDarth: That will be the day I jump off of a bridge
cowvarkian: someone said that in mane or the movie?
they already bought jetix years ago, and now it only airs disney cartoons :/
SuperBrony64: Moo
They bought out Nuclear missile silos already. :D
moooooo
I dont care if they buy the HUB, Hasbro however...
thelonepony: I said it
MOO
oh
There was a company that declined a contract from disney giving 1.000.000 dollars...
:P
Thanks AJIsAwesome :-)
I would say it was a great thing to do.
Glad to help, Canebridge.
SuperBrony64: Mooooo :3
If Disney bought out Hasbo, then I hope to god they don't change Dungeons and Dragons.
...Too bad we don't had co-existing cartoons or cartoon physics in our life...
I've often wondered what it would be like to live in a world like in musicals, where people break out into spontaneous song and dance routines. That'd be interesting too.
I hear that hasbro might be selling to disney
It's already a bad WoW clone as it is.
WAIT FOR MEH
no
LordDerpington: It would also be very tiring and monotanous.
Zacklego: Nah, it was debunked.
Zacklego: NO GOD NO!!!
Zacklego, Hosbro said that isn't true
Wait For MEee
nope.avi
You mean fiction books Gekoncze?
Oh yeah, speaking of, I know of a hidden message.
bcuz he's dirt poor thats why
dat jazz
IT WAS DEBUNKED
Zacklego: They denied it.
Haven't you realised something?
I dont know what hosbro is....
http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
hes doesnt have a car
T'was debunked
VenHur that they actually wanted to build a Highway or something there?
By the way, I was on a hasbro toy shop, I saw some... Disney toys.
(M)arvel, (L)ucasfilm Ltd, (P)ixar.
Sweet soundtracks

Hasbro = Has Brony

Wait, he got cigarettes from children? XD

VenHur: Lol

NO BUTTON!
Zacklego: You're right... :o
Coey890: yeah, because why not
what happend to ep 4
I got through school with only reading maybe 5 books in my 12 school years.
(Presses button)
VenHur: Disney purchase of My Little pony Brand CONFIRMED
Disney needs to bring back Twinkies. :o
lol
we have to read old books for example shakespeare, hemingway, sofokles... there are only a few good ones - for example from Tolkein
Zacklego: The fandom wouldnt allow for the purchase of MLP
inb4 jessica rabbit will come
disney doesnt own Hostess
Disney are secretly bronies!
Disney needs to learn from Disney.
That's stupid
Nope, especially is Disney is buying MLP
does this take place in the fifties.
I know, they could though.
Your welcome for the hidden message.
^^^^lol
Kipkat07_USAF: you think the star wars fandom would allow what happened?
Can I ask, What was the name of the video called when bronystate got hackedand there was that weird orange person with no body walking?
wipergone2: inb4 chat goes crazy
Cyberlord: 1947
RRRGH STILL ON LIMEV?
6i have to read lots of books like i have read over 20 in school
turtlegod98: idk maybe the hacer made it
AJIsAwesome: and i know y

three times
that was REALLY weird and hilarious.
Aww man, that sucks.
Yeah GNAA Hacked Bronystate
eeyup
yeah, during new episode earlier.
it was hacked three times
yep by a troll group
Haters: Now hacking videos that explain why bullying is wrong
No, no, no...I'm just NAMING the companies Disney brought in an alphabetical order.
Disney bought ENTIRE SW brand for 4 billion dollars. I wonder how much they'd have to pay to buy Hasbro.
It was the stream, not Bronystate - Big difference
Not just BronyState in particular
Glad i watched the ep on tv
I also know one joke about it, but it would be hard to translate from czech
Wait... DURING NEW EPISODE EARLIER?!
i'm sure the new star wars can never be as good as the first 6
orangeperson with no legs moves likes jagger
Well LimeV is "doing maintenance" on my end :[

Scootaloo-the-Awesom: yep. dont you love the world?
RainbowDerpy: Was not 4Chan, was BNAA

Goodbye everyone.

oh boy
Aye
BronyAlchemist: calling us horse fucker is bullying
skip to 12:13
Which MEANS...it's a sign of what's to come!
RainbowDerpy: it was GNAA not 4chan
Disney would ruin Ponies.
Darn.. Don't wanna be picking a knife up while the train passes by

Guys we need to track down the hackers and get revenge on there asses
EVERYMANS dream girl in 3...
Cajun: Daffy was that retarded to begin with. His conniving characteristics came in later.
Moopy: Option 1, mutilate them viscously. Option 2. Love and tolerate. Option 3. Assimilation.
and they completely dodged the point by hijacking it
2...
duck and cover
that pokemon hack is pretty cool, he basically builds a bootstrap using nothing but the inventory system which allows him to input his machine code midi player along with the PNG balloons image and the mlp midi themesong near the end.
If I see Felix the Cat in this, then I can die a happy Brony coat

I feel bad now, there's a lot of questions going on about the hacking.

Looks as though they got our stream info, which probably means either we got hacked, or mips got hacked.
OH GOD
Must've been.. Painless
im ALWAYS like: "why the hell is the moon here, its like 13:00"
We're not entirely sure though.
it's probably mips
Well, in a sense these are Cyberterrorists, no?

A netsplit is when two (or more) servers on a network disconnect from each other
:(
What line?
Cause this is why that 343 industries worked really really hard on making of Halo 4 right befor it statred coming out so eeyup
why is my K not working?
Where can you request shows?
Look in page 225.
So you see all the users on different servers to you disconnect
cachi01: Yeah especially smile.jpg

ping
i wonder what to do
Buck that tree, buck it hard.
Eagle: i was about to read that one but then i was like meh too much creepy for today
But what is it?
/me writes a page on what to do if you find a treee branch in you're middle of ya room
They are killing bloomberg!
Eagle: i was reading lots of .exe
wait, nevermind its back to normal now
twilight: can beat giant bears under stress. can't remove a tree from her bedroom because "it doesn't say so in the book"...

I forgot to vote. :$
6bye
Eli it was a joke
11,01I forgot to vote as well.
Ok
I....think I voted
First result
IshPonyPonyThePony: i know. but playing oblivious is so much fun :D
Number 24, XylemTube with Air Force One for A
I think too IshPonyPonyThePony
Gunna check IMDb
I cant vote for A :(
aur force one?
Air Force One is a Harrison Ford movie.
air*
2 more weeks until i can, i think
Errr
Is Air Force One an A movie
Or B Movie?
get off my plane
It feels like a B movie imo, but the stats tells otherwise.
i'll bee right back
11,01It's an A movie.
11,02Lottery \:D/
the movie was a big deal at the time.
11,01Harrison Ford.
Ok, we have our A
Do you know who Harrison Ford is? He's the main lead.
Yeah but is it a GOOD movie to be an A?
On to the B film
11,02Moo ^-^
6.3 good enough
EspyLacopa: One actor makes not a movie, it's several =P
Since did "A Movie" mean good?
Ohai, SB. :3
11,02Hai :3
ohai
You missed the cows, SB. :<
Dat SuperBrony64 :3
Number 41, Deacon with Cinderella (1997)
EspyLacopa: So you would say Titanic is an A Movie? =P
11,02Moo? o.o
Considering the budget? Yes.
11,02How was the episode this morning? :D
It was good. :)
Oh God it looks horrifying
we were hijacked a couple times
inb4 another hack
SuperBrony64, We got hijacked ;_;
The definition of "B Movie" is that it's a low-budget film
And a cult-classic. :3
I was in a pokemon RP once for like 5 posts, really didn't get into it much
Yep, we have our B film
Cinderella
1997
Nah
"Impossible.. things are happening eeeeveryyyy daaaay"
Updated version of the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical of the classic fairy-tale, with an all-star, multi-racial cast.
Pony eps now
Cult Classics are typically low budget movies (B Movies) that somehow managed to be very popular.
Frequently after it's run at the theatres has finished.
Hammerstein sounds familiar, and usually a good movie director
This was a TV special
Number 66, Dark92Enigma, with A Canterlot Wedding Pt 1
EspyLacopa: So FF Spirit Within is an A movie?
:P
Now I don't wanna pick Fiddler on the Roof for A :(
No idea.
Sweet, so we have 3 pony episodes to watch next week. :3
I'vve been a normal Bronystater for over almost 1 and a half year it feels like
And finally number 25, Mekapi, with Elements of Harmony Pt 1
Haven't won once. :D
In the end. . .it's frequently going to vary from viewer to viewer if a particular movie is A or B because noone seems to agree on a solid definition.
:O
Hah, two two parters
hello
4 eps to watch. :O
So, we have our lineup
:L
A - Air Force One - XylemTube
Damn 2 2 part episodes O.O
So I'm guessing it's going to be a long BMN? :D
No
B - Cinderella (1997) - Deacon
Nah
Ah, okay.
Pony 1 - A Canterlot Wedding Pt1 - Dark92Enigma
They probably wont do the full things
Pony 2 - Elements of Harmony Pt1 - Mekapi
Where was Gondor when the 2 parter has been doubled
OMG that B Movie looks horrifying
nnnnnn Air Force One is as bad as Firewall and Cinderella has a ton of songs.
Movie B?
@vinyl scratch
are you streaming both parts?
B movie didn't seem that bad
yippie
Wait Cinderella? theres one that wasnt the disney version?
Cinderella?
and worst of all it could be any one of us
I wasn't even able to send anything in because I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO FUCKING DO!!
Well this is gonna be a long movie night
movie A
if there's an A movie, chances are there's a B movie replicating it
I went to the newsletter area, but it said there weren't any available surveys!

/me puts a hat on cachi01
But for those who haven't seen Skyfall yet, let me sum it up for you: it's "The Dark Knight" and "Bourne" in different colored wrapping, executed a bit more poorly, and while it's a good movie....it's still not Bond.
Spy: Oh, dear. You've made quite a mess.
poor kid

Cyberlord, I suppose any workable strategy would involve gaining his trust, and catching him when he's Bruce Banner.

About two and a bit day's continuous viewing, all the Bonds.

Moonrise Kingdom was like an old chapter book I read as a kid come to life. It hit me hard
and apparently bigfoot farted and it created a crater

RaveBrony: and they don't fail with that?
Suuupp

No bodys danish :(
Huh, sounds good
Record_Discord: ......Crap. That's awful!

cachi01: why?
TROOOLLLLLLLL IN THE DUNGEON
thelonepony: g4k in his name

Him= herobrine
thelonepony: how are you? :3
Blaze: Seriously, they have this twitter thing and they're joking about how bronyism is a cover for pedophilia.
<3
SO loki is narrirating
jealous much Loki?
cachi01: i see it now >:I
GNAA is basically, a professional trolling organisation. That's all they do. They troll, hack, and just plain be jerks because they think it amusing.
Poor banner.
Crash again -.-
Yep
loki
Kencolt: just like anon
Dont worry Loki, you get to be a bad guy in a few years
loki
I will say this, Spoilers: Loki fucks shit up alot in this movie

i can only see a maintenance message, not the actual stream...
puny god
Всем доброй ночи.
Loki,we've seem Avengers.Believe me,that won't go well.
Kencolt: that what it summerises
ahh hhaaah i i i couldnt ...
Loki wasn't a bitch in the comics, compared to the movies.
Thor is a bit of a lummox if you look up lummox in the dictionary and think about it.
Есть 4 серия с переводом?
He was actually formitable
And in a few years Loki regrets this
Record_Discord: Im starting to think that the haters are more effed up than they believe us to be...
and then sex happens
.MUAHAHAHAHHAHAA
Loki was a sexy bitch in the movies Dashie_Dashie

The Warrior's Three. Truly Champions.
....Gimli?
DoctoDoctorWho: Nailed it on the head, Doctor.

volstagg ftw!
I hated what the movies did to Loki, from genius schemes for revenge, to parlor tricks
Vikings are awsome

Just doing my job
Fangal, Tovler and Volstagg

British Thor is best Thor

British Thor is only Thor.
Blaze, I was just think that.
That gif is the answer to everything duuh
Ragna-fucking-rok.

Now it's just the rage of the Hulk that remains.

Nyst: Oh my god he does!
It like when they banned unicycles and everyone became obsessed with unicycles.
OH MY FUCKIN GODDDDDDDD
DerpyHooves
So the only thing that can stop the hulk is Banner him self right?

Baldur's Horn?

Epicness
I THROW my hammer
SpadeMagnes[School: yes but its pretty hard to kill them
seriously, Where's Heimdall?
While holding it
11,01I'm asking some others what it could be. Hang on.
This comic series rapes mythology
that's not how a hammer works
Now we need Hulk Vs Dan Vs [anything random]
VenHur: WHAT???
So who the hell is this?
I throw my hammer in the air some times saying eeeeeyooo
So wait, then if Baldur is blowing Baldur's Horn, then did the Hulk just break Baldur's Gate? O.o
suit yourself buddy
all right
PUNY GODS :(
THE POWER OF THE STARS
HIT YOU
Puny gods : (
hammer!
SpadeMagnes[School: think of him as a Homoncula from FMA
HAMMER OF DAWN AWAY!
Record_Discord: What? Don't like the idea? Blasphemy!
SpadeMagnes[School: They are the type of god that can die, but are fatedly impossible to kill untill ragnarock because thats when the universe says they die.
YokusaHHart: Indeed
Dem moves
dat drama
VenHur: I myself am blasphemy, friend.
NOPE
How does Thor know about the Hulk? He met him before?
this is like a soap oprah
noone in there
SapdeMagnes[School the Asgards aren't technically gods, they are aliens but humans see them as gods
Puny underling holds gate for 10 minutes. Thor loses it in 30 seconds
banner isnt in the beast
Norse Mythology ftw!
Say what!
dem lips
it looks crazy
LOL
Loki made the perfect kinect
btw who is le girl?
Goddamnit Loki you ARE a bitch
she wasnts the d
Mortal combaaat
YEARS BEFORE EVEN
that's Enchantress
the hulk does not say anything beyond 2 words.
the enchantress
So...Why don't they KILL loki whenever he does stuff like this?
round 1... FIGHT
its hammer time
Guys. that hammer is SO powerful. you won't be able to comprehend it
Cyberlord: Hulk, and smash.
SpadeMagnes[School: :D so Microsoft is working for Loki?
So what good does beating up the hulk do if he cant be stopped?
now for 15 min of pounding I guess
So she's an evil enchantress....
Blaze: Because then Marvel wouldn't be able to squeeze money out of him anymore? :D
Cyberlord: Depends on the Time. During World War Hulk, he could speak full sentences.
CriticKitten: She does evil dances...
CriticKitten: she does evil dances
Norse god vs. Geneticly mutated human.
what happened in hulk vs wolverine?
btw Mjlonir is usually 10x more powerfull than that....
ALL MY MONEY
Rex_Mundi: So you must hate the sandman series
CriticKitten: And what will she do?
GODDAMNIT Ryunosuke!
hehe
pony_4908: True, but I meant in the mythos.
11,01Turns out LimeV (our streaming service) might not work in your country due to a block.
YokusaHHart: Indeed, but we're in this comic myth now
Probably mix up an evil brew
nicde try loki...
CriticKitten: and if you look into her eyes,she will put yout in trances! :D
YokusaHHart it's not that it's weaker, it's just that it against the Hulk
trollhammer
So if Banner is the only thing that can stop the hulk, what would beating him up do?
Haha still weak
LOLNOPE

Is the hammer fucking magnetised?
freaking hammers made of dark matter
WEAK ASS LOKI
And she'll gobble you up!
IT HAS THE WEIGHT OF A COLLAPSED STAR

STOP IT LOKI

Mwahahahahaha

Trolly this is the best of two words...

Fymr
>le hell

Aren't they against the Norse gods anyway?
Hey there goes Kratos
i wonder if scorpion is in here?
Hel , not Hell
Oh look.... Hell.
Frost Giants. For some reason the listen to Loki. They are mighty, strong, and none to bright.
Loki never visits his daughter.
what an awful dad
why is it when someone says "for asgard" they get destroyed by the hulk?
"As long as i lived i hoped never to see this realm" it's the realm of the dead you genius....
It was all a dream...
he is alive?
Kencolt: Loki is half God Half Giant
Why do the frost giants follow loki?
Sleipnir?
Everything was all a dream!
ping
half Asgard not God Vordox
And you were there, and you were there, too! :O
GODDAMNIT VenHur NOT ANNNOTHER ONE OF THOSE EPISODES
It was all a dream... A crazy, crazy dream!
Zamer: No, I'm pretty sure he's half God. :P
<--- OH SHIT
OH SHIT
lolwut?
Sleipnir and Hela are brethren.
THIS IS BAD
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOHAHAHA WHO'S THE BROAD?
THIS IS FRICKING BAD
the script for this must be awesome...and then hulk fights this guy but goes away and fights this guy...and than that one..but the other one came back with friends and then they fight some more and...
Bruce had a wife?
Vordox: Which explains a lot about his plans. Clever? Yes. Tricky? Yes. Bright? Not so much, apparently.
He's in the paradise. SHIT SHIT SHIT
yes Spade
Giggity.
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT??????
>daddy
a child.
The norse Paradise, worst place EVER
DoctoDoctorWho: Yeah, I'm not really paying attention, mod things to deal with. :P
he has kids?
WAT
this is dah future
woulndt hulk sex make her infertile?
Bruce had a son? What the fuck?
its a dream within a dream
he ded
that is a bad idea
So... is it Valhalla?
JK YOUR IN HELL
WUT?
Blaze: No
He's in the Matrix
Ohai Hela
This is the life he should have had-- were it not for the Hulk.
hes the hulk and he has kids
Vordox: Then where is he?
A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM http://inception.davepedu.com/
Blaze: The past wall of Valhalla
iirc he had a daughter. she was also a hulk and her sister is also hul
I'll see myself out
.....What, Vordox?
<--- Loves Norse Myths
Thor, you forgot to throw your hammer at her head before you speak to her
Vordox: Look! See? Hela!
Vordox: Same here
SpadeMagnes[School: that doesn't seem that bad
Blaze: If you were a hero, you'll go to Valhalla, where you fight till you die, once you die in Valhalla you go to Paradise
So Hella is the norse equivalent of hades?
cachi01 no that was his cousin who was also a hulk, he did have a son on another planet though as the hulk
/me does tableflip at DoctoDoctorWho
dat bargaining
back to punching
Vordox: Nope, Valhalla is infininte warrior respawn heaven
Ooohhh.... Sorry, I only know Greek myths. I should read more Norse myths.
Valhalla is the "heaven" for Warriors , all whodont die in battle and get picked by the valkyries goto Hel (the general underworld) and there get tortured/rewarded
yeah, Valhalla is not Paradise. More of a waiting room
Your a wizard hulk
DoctoDoctorWho: You forgot something
DoctoDoctorWho: This is the TWISTED version
wood does not act like that
Which is different
hulk is a muscle wizard
Vordox: Actually, you just get up again, eat a LOT, and fight the next day-- or so the original myths went. Vikings were fond of eating and fighting.
Wasn't Valhalla a Perpetual battlefield, with a nice dinner and sleep between the battles? :P
KISSSSSS
Iwa: I thought so
Just kidding, you're in HEEEEEEEEEEL
Iwa: yep heaven for warrior
s
He was happy for once in his life (lolgeddit)
And this happens
Vordox: True, Im trying to explain the real myth, wheras this is marvel, where they screwed up everything. sorry /)
cockblocked
DoctoDoctorWho: *(\ I'm geting confused too, but I'm keeping up :P
DAMNIT, NOT LIFE AGAIN!
not sure if fail hac attempts

The stream keeps freezing.. for me, at least..
I AM SAXTON HULK! President and CEO of MANN CO, and the man who is going to BURN YOU HOUSE DONW! :[
Doors? what doors?
<--- THE CROWS
What the hell is the hulk trying to do right now?
puny sword go
Hugin and Mumin!
birds! kill them
the Marvel version is the old myths are based-- and corrupted- from Asgardian reality. Go fig.
SpadeMagnes[School: kill everything
Bruce Banner: the only marvel character that is more depressing than spider man
the hulk is the god of rage
Kills Thor, dies by crows
dem crows
norway ftw
SpadeMagnes[School: smash shiny light, what else?
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE CANDY BAR
attack of the crows
hes an earthbender
i just realized
Okay, Seriously, Heimdall is the protector of Asgard....Where the F*ck is he?
EARTHBENDER
The Hulk is Smashing. Without Banner, that's all he does.
Heimdall is watching Bifrost
BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!
too dumb to teleport the hulk
typical woman
._.
internet
damn.
dar
she's the only one who actually DID anything to the hulk.
nope

Dat No
Nope
alrighty then

Hulk smash?
Ello bronystate

Hi there HoodyNinja how are you? :)
Hai HoodyNinja :)
Hi Hoodyninja~
Kencolt: That will be funny as hell when he turns around and sees half of asgard leveled
hi HoodyNinja
Greek mythology must be overrated if the Hulk can beat all the Gods
hey HoodyNinja
Oh hi all you people
Norse not Greek
Wait....He's going to die in Hel? WHAT?!?!?
Hey, peeps
he is mad
how was your day HoodyNinja? :)
yes
Zamer: Actually, the marvel version is mixed
ghosts
who ya gonna call?
J_E_Smith71 Norse, not greek
There's Greek and Norse in this version
SGT_01G4K38FS: Lazy -_-
Which is why it's twisted.
Shit
HULK SMASH GHOST
J_E_Smith71: Marvel done fucked this one up, and this is norse btw :P
loki
Loki is bad father
Whose that VA?
at least if banner was going to die, he wouldn''t be going far
I haven't seen no Greek Mytho in this so far
billy: Gkost Busters!
that sounded like trixie.
Who had gack in their name?
for a second
Die alone
It was your fault Loki
Meant to say Norse:p
THERE IS NO HELL in Norse myth ffs =P
There is
It's called Hel
remember, this monster is really just an innocent man who owns a laboratory ;)
but there is an underworld
It's Hella
hel is the realm of the dead
howdy everypony Bad Apple was an awesome CMC episode, was it not? :$
actually there is Vodox
The Underworld.
lol Vordox what is norse? :P
it's Helhiem
Yes there is a unerworld
but true warriors go to valhalla
Vordox: But Hel and Hell are pronounced the same, right?
Yeah YokusaHHart
So if you die in hell does that make you double dead?
AskPeachy: Song was nice
Vordox: not hell specificly, but there is niffelheim, Muspelheim, and valhalla
anyone getting a laggy stream?
How do his pants NOT get smashed?
and then a kiss cant save you
Eeyup
i am
SpadeMagnes[School: It makes you a gamer
Loki is messed up, his children include what ? Hel , Sleipnir , Fenrir , Jormagund ?
i love how the hulk was just in canida now he is in hell
Starlight_Pheonix: Yeah.
the death has been DOUBLED
Vordox: Actually, there is. It's basically a no-place where those who didn't die in battle went. Just a big dull place with nothing happening... kinda like Purgatory.
<<Norse Mythology nerd :$
babs seeds ^^
AskPeachy: hey look, someone discussing ponies on bronystate, haven't seen that in a while
Kencolt: That's Helheim
I don't really like loki
So... Who is this Slepnir everyone talks about?
HURT LOKI HURT HIM
Fail gods
is he the snake, or the wolf?
but, he has an army
I thought it was supposed to be a land covered in snow
not in this movie anyway

HoodyNinja: Not a personal attack meant with that...more like a fridge horror realisation :)

lolollololololol
so take loki
SLENDERMAN SHADOWS.
did you watch the pony episode yet, red_ony? :)
yes
So... Why do ANY OTHER RELIGIONS EXIST IN MARVEL?!?!? The people KNOW Thor is real, so all of the Norse myths are, so they know these are REAL GODS!
Wow...
Take a gods soul?
Hela has dadddy issues
HoodyNinja: not actually a god
nope
GG Loki
yummy
she's his daughter...
Kay then
half god
nah
there are other religoins, like hercules esxists too
Wow
naaaahh
he diserved it
SGT_01G4K38FS: That I did...but not on bronystate...with all the lagging and hacking ^^
lol
She did that to her father?
oh snap
read the incredible hercules, it explains the gods in marvel
Blaze they aren't actually gods they just have the god ego
and kicked again...thanks for that...
:/
no she isnt
HoodyNinja: Who are you talking about? O.O
they called her sister
JEALOIS/
Jealousy STRIKES
Hey, everypony.
Now Thor gets all the bitches.
dat wall
Moral of the story? Everyone hates each other due to Thor existing :)
Dat wall of ping
Record_Discord: Don't ping spam peopel
Okeh
o_o
hi Red_Pegasus
people*
...
Sorry
Record_Discord: ouch!
Damnit Odin
11,01Record_Discord: Watch the spam, please.
...
his secret is that he is the god of hoes
Thor being real doesnt proove the legends about him or the norse religion , in much the same way that the fact that NewYork exists doesnt proove the exisance of Spiderman
I got tired no more
/me wanted to be ping spammed....
Record_Discord: how was your day? :)
I promise
and Odin was totally oblivious
"Did I miss something?"
So tired
I'm done
Fun Fact, Odin was pretending to sleep the entire time
Hi, Record_Discord
could odin beat the hulk?
LAWL
HAHAHAH
Sorry everbody
Troll daugter
Hi Nittany_Discord
VALHALLA
ha.
Odin is like their Luna,missing the best stuff and all...
odin could
"Except you Heimdall, you need to do better next time"
He didn't sacrifice..
SGT_01G­4­K38FS: it is a nice day indeed
He was forced
=P
Odin steals the show
YES
Lol isn
Aww wrong song
and thus he became a hero
poor bruce
....Any Deadpool?
isn't that how it ended in the tv series?
10/10
Hulk is best pony
nice
saves the world, cant get a ride to jersey
Needs more Heimdall/10
Which one?
i
VenHur: yes
Starlight_Phoenix: He IS a pony! Roid Rage!"
needs more deadpool but it gets a 8/10
Dashie_Dashie: Actually, in the TV series-- or rather the followup movies-- Banner eventually died and the Hulk with him.
SGT_01G4K38FS: You mean one bad apple?Yeah,I've seen it.Probably gonna stay for the rerun,though
I didn't get to see the episode here (for shame) and I heard BronyState got hacked. Is this true?
FANDRAL STAGHELM
cough
most common super power/10
The stream is really skipping out for me.
11,01French Tickner? What a name.
It is true, Canadian
lol
<--- In before after credit clip
Canadian_Brony: Yeah.
And oh yeah Nicole Oliver was in this
There he is!
Nittany_Discord: ikr
Dat artwork.
gotta love how canon of the Hulk was thrown out of the Window for that TV series
Man thats annoying
:V
yeah, but thtas true for any adaptation
Nittany_Discord: I initially read it as French Tickler...Heh...:P
Benjojo: what is, I didnt get it. :P
Rev up those ponies!
so after ass kicking time... is it pony time?
how did you guys like ep 4
it was good
whats next?
Ponies
Dashie_Dashie: Rev up those fryers!
so what superheroes/gods could beat the hulk?
yay
Will there be a bonus movie today?
ear princess celestia. today i learned that no one fucks with the hulk
Dashie_Dashie: which pony do you like the most?
none reddawn
r-dash we aren't allowed to talk about it for another 18-ish hours.
Pinkie Pie, sillys.
First, Bird In The Hoof, then One Bad Apple
r-dash: I liked it except for the freakin' hacks.
oh
reddawn: galactus
Canadian_Brony: Well we can talk about during the encore
J_E_Smith71: so did you find out which pony you liked the mose? ^_^
actually cowvarkian Hulk took down Galactus
-_-
cowvarkian?
hi there cowvarkian
nvm
Too cold to be feeling chills....
SGT_01G4K38FS: Pinkie and Derpy
Zamer: how would that even work
r-dash it's to avoid spoilers for those who haven't seen the episode, but I CAN tell you that I absolutely love it.
This music is so like the theme to the Merlin miniseries from about fifteen years ago.
hi gunny
was it when he was ww hulk?
hello SGT_01G4K38FS
Given the GNAA attack, I think the spoiler rule timer should be reset when it's screened after BMN
i really wanted roger rabbit...
:oooooooo
pony time
i don't think there's any canon in marvel stuff... each new writer or filmmaker does his own thing
SGT_01G4K38FS, you broke the filter!
yay
XD
it felt "short" and uneventfull , but that might be due to the protagonists
there we go
PONIES
TIME FOR PONIES
Missed the lottery, what won?
I love this episode
Its pony time
Run Lola run
Hello there Yellow Quiet.
Boo, lags.
so KarugaKun
Eli, yes, but they still build off of what the previous writer did. That's why dead characters keep coming back to life.
You're not Alice, Fluttershy
ya what won guys
DING DING
man Angel needs a sticky note or something :D
LAG.
inb4 trollestia
I seem to remember more than a few fanworks dressing Fluttershy up as Alice.
spitfirecolt: Air Force One and Cinderella
cowvarkian it was in the Marval Zombie storyline, Hulk and Galactus fought and Hulk killed and ate him
was that Pinkie's Dress there in her closet?
why does fluttershy have most of the other ponies dresses?
i need to go good bye evrypony
lol
Zamer: that shouldnt work
bye sweetie.
my little pony
Yellowquiet is cutest pony.
sweet i love those movies
chat lags?
I love this scene
lag
so this should be good
Dammit Lime
see ya SweetieG4K
later SweetieG4K
One writer will kill off a particular character, and the next writer liked that character, so his story will involve the character coming back to life. The only thing that can KEEP a character dead is a memo saying not to bring that particular character back
Oh S1
G4K
latas Sweetie
nice.
AJTheMightyGamer: Probably because Rarity had no more room, this was shortly before the Gala. And Rarity was making LOTS of dresses.
Dash u so cute
erblblblblbbl!
lol
trololol
MY LITTLE PONY, DID YOU KNOW YOUR MY VERY BEST FRRRRRIEND!!

DinkyDoo: i was there
I HATE LAGS.
DocSane: seems legit
AJTheMightyGamer: ikr
Totally legit.
Hi DocSane
Is anybody looking for Animation Errors?
DocSane: Make sure to lend her extra money!
CCCP: Hey there.
DocSane: i dunno about that...
DRHUnleashed: And she lives in Africa, so I know this is for real. :)
ALL THE JOINS

DocSane: is she a nigerian prince?
Mmm ham
raity seems mad

DocSane: interesting
Me too.
cowvarkian: I think she may be his widow.'
DocSane: ah
/me Looks for animation errors
Galactus sadly isn't as powerful as people made him out to be being a planet eater and all
the chat was buggy
didnt know they had internet in africa
I wondered when that nigerian prince would finally die, DocSane
why i have dat name?
I LOVE HOW PINKIE PIE CHEWS RIGHT THERE.
Dat Pinkie gasp.
and here it is
oh dear pinkie...

Dashie_Dashie: Ahahaha

Ponies
EMPTY TEACUP AD 4:00
I used to get emails like that, DocSane . LOTS of them. Apparently they thought I was a Marine colonel. (I also used to get insane amounts of Korean and Russian SPAM-- and I have no idea why.)
Gotcha!

KinsagaKing: she made the cakes fill up her cup too much
./_\ no more pizza for me
did the cakes make the same sound like pinkie
yes
I DIDN'T SAY IT
KinsagaKing: Yeah, I watched on TV directly while watching the chat on my laptop.
Phoenix allmost dies ---> Celestia is completely ok with that :D
KinsagaKing, the Cakes were refilling her cup with tea every time she took a sip, so she pretended to take a sip without actually drinking anything and they overfilled her cup
XD
lol
Two in a row \:3/
bak i say
Celestia. Kind. Benevolent. Just. Wise. And occaisionally a bit... silly.
DUN DUN DUN
Wow, I got kicked for a typo.
dat trolling phoenix
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUH
Fluttershy is best Kleptomaniac
WHY CAN'T WE HAVE ANYONE LIKE THAT IN OFFICE?
/me is NOT a troll
;3
DocSane: You don't get it
fluttershy is best kidnapper
the kicking needs to stop
Are you okay after the whole /v/ hacking fiasco?
LOL
DocSane: Kinsaga-King <--- check DAT name silly
ifiredmylazar: how is it kicking? O.O
>_>
i wonder how fluttershy would do as a mother?
ifiredmylazar: Why are they getting kicked?
Oooh...
SO... MUCH..... BUFFER.....
Clever.
/v/ is the most boring board
Vinylscratch: just press alT+f4 to fix it
they are saying the word i ccant say
SO..... LITTLE...... BUFFER.....
why doesnt she put blanket and ice patch
hhjhhjhhjhhhj
I got kicked for pinging someone who cleverly hid "that-which-must-not-be-named in his nick.
cowvarkian http://derpy.me/H9wz-
lol wat ep is this
I found it funny that the bullying episode was disrupted by bullies.
ifiredmylazar: That commercial?
Floam?
yes
I was the ONLY one who noticed his name? :P
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Watch it Ralph / The Plan / Breaking Babs / Hoof Trick / The Fluttershy Incident
ShadowQuill: hello! I like ponies. :)
Hi KingsagaKing!!!
Kandarihu: you mean g­ak?
:d
Vordox: Whose name?
>.>
KinsagaKing: HELLO!
DocSane, and there's talk of retaliation for the attack.
it is stupid. i got kicked and i did even say it
ShadowQuill: Kinsaga-King <-- :P
I think there is a conspiracy going on with Kinsaga King ..
Wrek: I didn't even say the word!!!
Kandarihu: Are they building a giant apple float and tricking the /v/ guys onto it?
how so ekips?
chugga woo woo!!
I say Kinsaga-King is a GREAT troll :D
gunny everybody who is pingin him gets kicked
every bodys watching mlp while im just watching winter gak up
Oh.
Hmm
Well, if you can't beat em, join em.
g-ak
hi ther [Derpy]
:3
kagkagkag
Kinsaga: Hey, what's up?
Hello :P
Kinsa[gaK]ing lol i just realized that hahah
YELLOWQUIET, WHY ARE YOU SO GODDAMN CUTE.
RivaLz: Fail
ahhh
SHE SINGS SO MAJESTICLY.
why is the word banned anyway? does spamming it break the chat?
EW,
MegaKoala: Or don't mind 'em :)
xDDDDDD
It wasn't /v/ though it was other guys. Probably used /v/ as a cover to get the Bronies to go get revenge on them, and they laugh as everyone makes fools of themselves
hi there Kinsaga­King
red_ony: It got annoying
DocSane, no, just going to war against GNAA and everything.
who hacked us
hi Karuga Kun
I fell asleep while the Hulk was tearing up Asgard, wha'd I miss?
ok ffs i never ever will mention that green floam stuff ever AGAIN!
Karuga: You did it as well
J_E_Smith71: It's mostly solved with /V/ and Bronies at 4chan
They know it was g-naa
ren_ony because a certain commercial was spammed on the Hub today and during the season premier
That's not a humidifier. That's a radiator, an old method of apartment heating that is so out of date, I can't even-- it's old even to ME.
damn my computer derped.... what happend?
rarity sneeze
Jazmyn: It said /v/ but Scoot-Scootaloo suspects the GNAA
ShadowQuill: did what? g­a­k?
TETSUO!
hmm... i c...
o.o
karuga: WHY?
AJTheMightyGamer: I made the ponies. Who is your favoirte? :)
KANEDA!
That's useless ointment if it cause bumps to appear
String_Shredder: It was the GN-AA
I was kind of underwhelmed by the episode today.
Yes. The GNAA attack was a false-flag attack implicating /v/ which would've worked if they hadn't declared war on us 2 weeks ago.
Ending seemed a little too pat.
ShadowQuill: my ga­­k is on white list :)
KingsagaKing: Rainbow Dash is my favorite
The GNAA practically admittedit on their Twitter thingy.
It was fairly amusing
hello SweetieG4K
xD someones got kicked again haha
gtg bye everypony!
FLUTTERTHEIF!!!
Who ARE the GNAA?
That script is lame
i got kicked for telling someone my favorite pony:'(
LOL
bye
DocSane: Type it in google
xDDDDDD
DocSane: does it even matter?
hi there RivaLz
:)
DocSane: Their full name is too ugly to say in here
they are stupid
AJTheMightyGamer: Nah, Kinsaga-King has a part of the name that's interesting XD
hi Kinsa******** xD
AJTheMightyGamer: that's so cruel, but you can hug me
you dont SAY
Oh, those guys. They went after MLP videos on YouTube, didn't they?
i wont fall for that joke again :P
KarugaKun: /me hugs
Aek Aek Aek
hmm
DocSane: Basically, a pack of pointless trollers-- they admit as much. Their entire reason is to troll, hack, and annoy, because they find it amusing. In other words, losers. Yes, I went there. Losers.
tuberculosis?
... :'(
RivaLz: you sure about that?
Wait whats going on HNNNNNNNNH
Free hugs for everypony :)
/me hugs everypony
Yes i am :P
twilight is a very bad lier
Kencolt: There's few people I would kill in the world if I had the chance, and they just hit the top :P
AJTheMightyGamer: also, ga­k is forbidden :)
woot

1 MILION YEARS DUNGON
AJTheMightyGamer: Check their names you reply to :P

As far as I see things now, a bullying situation becomes a race to who can get the authorities on their side. And the bullies CAN win such a race if the victims don't act first.

._.
LadyCanary: You're better just ignoring them. If they don't figure it out, they don't figure it out. XD
Hi hi SpitFire and Cyberlord and wub!
like fusing?
Really people...really, something happens and your minds imediatly drift to the worst case scenario?
oh no another hacking is comin soon i can feel it
hello
WERE DOOMED
was there any gak ads during todays episode
I feel like Im the only one who trys to not focus on all the fucking negatives
pssh no we're not doomed.
Deacon, 4chan called him a pedo for loving applebloom, he cried like a little girl, and the creators felt bad and allowed him to work with them on an future episode.
Serenity: The fandom's at critical mass. That won't be resolved in a nice way.
Inb4 Wrek's just pulling all of your legs
GilDash: That's gonna be a lot of blocking really.
hence fanpandering.
King yes
SpadeMagnes[School we're a bit pessimist :\
g*K IS COMINGTO GET US
limeV is shit
STOP TALKING ABOUT IT
yah like 7 g** ads
dont mind if its hacked so long as it isnt that creepy turkey again
I appologize to everyone watching PS2 on stream, I logged in and server is comming down in 5 minutes for a quick update
LadyCanary: I didn't mean /ignore them. XD
05this might work
gak
make it stop
now with more g*k@sonic
I feel sorry for hackers who will never know the sun on their faces, or the epic funs of mountain biking, or surfing or anything outdoors
comoooon wreky
Hi r-dash
lol "dats a paddlin
g*k
a
Sonicrainboom_BOOM: thts bullshit
cccp:hi
I know I cant be blind to the cons, but you guys seem to always focus on the negatives
Kurra: I don't. The deserve what they get. :D
why not using twitch.tv?
g k
Wrek you should play Secret of the Magic Crystal
_a
GilDash: It doesnt change the fact that they keep showing up anyways
Dashie_Dashie: Is that True Story?
Dashie_Dashie ..wha? let him work on an episode just because of that? I saw that thread, it was just someone saying yes, plus it didn't last that long
And Ive been getting massive headaches.
BECAUSE of it.
My dick is hard.
Hi GreatNector King and Zacklego Spy and DRHUnleashed
in 6days are we gonna watch MLP movies
...
it was only three post in it
LadyCanary: Eh, give it time. They've got to give up eventually, right?
est
what does this have to do with ponys
okay, never say that
hello CCCP
hi CCCP
King my gak is not
how are you doing?
I really want to see the one bad apple episode
r-dash: nothing
Welcome back Derpy_Hooves and Serenity
back
05did it stop shuttign off?
me toot
I wonder if they will make an MLP movie to be released in theatres?
r-dash: Read the FAQ, plese.
I am adopting a wait and see attitude on this
ded
yep
Wrek, it looks good on my end, now.
I think so.
yeah now it keeps playing
CCCP: Bastard bloody chat, derping for the 3rd time in the same hour
I wont judge it till I have more info so...
Hai VenHur
yt its bak
r-dash ponies are awesome, Planetside 2 is awesome, and streaming ponies 24/7 is boring to the point of sanity. Besides, that's what YouTube is for.
but yea, tbh, Mando's being a drama queen
Hi GreatNector
What is going on with the gnaa?
Canadian_Brony is right :U
hello everypony
ello GreatNector
I was streaming MLP and Planetside 2 on twitch a few days ago lol
gnaa hacked bronystates stream
And hello KiwiBahamut
hi GreatNector
using Xsplit...had it in PiP
i was watchig a creamy chat
Jageman: assholes are what they are
how is everyone doing?
05fr4nky1: lol no they hijacked it
good?
No idea why they tried to pin it on /v/ though
05not hack it
I don't think LimeV likes me very much.
MFN they wouldn't be here still if you guys weren't reacting
GilDash: same here
-sighs- good...
I know what GNAA did, what is the comunity going to do about it?
why stop?
Hello.
Are you people stupid?
can we the Canterlot Royal Wedding?
Hi r-dash
thelonepony: Ah, good to know I'm not entirely alone.
GilDash: but we cant use mips atm
They did this shit to GET A REACTION
thelonepony: Yeah, I saw.
Hi Sloverdable
GTFO :D
who did what...I just joined in
well isnt it up to mips and gnaa?
SpadeMagnes[School: Oh, is that what trolls do? :D
NO WAY
05Jageman: why should we do anythign?
Do the mods still use Veemi?
They're gonna keep doing this shit if we keep reacting to it
good night everyone. may your dreams be full with pink ponies and G4K
Jageman: We'd just be adding fuel to the fire.
Ignore trolls and they get bored and go away
mips if they were smart would do it as it is losing them streamers and viewers
SpadeMagnes[School: my reaction "u mad because i watch someting u hate?"
Night Yellowquiet
That is true SpadeMagnes[School
yay yelloquiet
Wrek: I did not say we should, I was just asking.
ur name looks like mine
Jageman: we just sit back and grab some popcorn :)
But of course not everyone in the fandom has a fucking brain...so they add fuel to the fire
SpadeMagnes[School: Probably shouldn't waste your fingertips typing out that speech, it's the brony community after all.
Ah, Audioslave. ^_^
this is just like this i saw called Borderlands
howdy everypony
Hello eveyone.
Hi pony_3391 hi MASF123 and pony_365492

im drunk and id like to speak about ponies with you.
Hi MaxTheBrony
well this is nice
What's going on?
now limeV is lagging again -.-
GilDash: No problem. And the guitarist is Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine.
Heya guys ! :)
r-dash: No, just a walking orange over some music and a face saying "IT'S HAPPENEING AGAIN"
LadyCanary: Yeah, I know now you said Audioslave. I've got quite a bit of RAtM. ^_^
pony_365492: Go lie down. You're drunk.
Heya CCCP !
hi MaxTheBrony
Ok...rant over

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ9vWulShds
Worgeral yes, but it's on YouTube
Oh well then:/
Worgeral, yes. The non-hacked encore, too.
I keep falling down these stairs
What is this I heard about some stream getting hacked?
those who missed it
wipergone2 no links during stream please :)
sry
Serenity: I think we'll be testing out all our old and current providers
wooooaaahhhh howd u get thatt
s'aright
the bronystate stream got hijacked by GNAA
Who is GNAA?
MASF123, a troll group
Google it
facility lost?
What he playing?
DRHUnleashed: Your not helping.
Deacon: Lawl.
:/
MASF123: Let me give you a funny(note, not actually funnt) and breif sum up: MIPS was hijacked and it displayed a dancing orange that was dancing to some black music, then the next was some guy saying "IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN"
Gasoline, Planetside 2. The first big-name F2P game my computer can't handle
besides the crude name, they have been lethal
MASF123: its not a joke thats their actual name xD
Gak National Asshole Association
least it wasn't the GNAC, those Canadians can be brutal
05goan stream some more jack in a minute :D
Sounds good
Kandarihu: Heh, think of how much El Shitbox would explode
YAY Wreky <3
Well seeing as they only hack to be trolls, it isnt that lethal
hi
lololloolololl
but knowing them this attack could've been worse
Does anyone know where I can get a Planetside 2 Prepay Gamecard in Germany?
Serenity: EL shitbox?
i wanna cum inside rainbow dash :l
Lol. You get kicked for talking about G.a.k now?
Is this safe for fillies?
SpadeMagnes[School: My old computer remember? Had the processing power for a world war 2 stone calculator
pony_648161: WTF
Ah...right
pony_648161 this is not 4chan. Please act appropriately or leave.
ekips: why? its f2p
Serenity, it's not a matter of that. The game doesn't even recognize my GPU as valid. It instantly crashes.
So how massive are these maps?
It's sad that there is such hatred in this world.
_Scootaloo_ 100% filly approved
pony_648161 your so awesome.
fr4nky1 I'd like to get a membership though
fr4nky1 Because it's a good game and I want to support it
Kandarihu: What do you have? Mind had a Nvidea geforce 8800 gtx
The trolls are never ususaly the problem, the mane issue are the people who react to it
thx... 100% filly approved wow..
Brb y'all.
Serenity, Radeon 4250
i didnt heared of this game until ow
HD or basic?
UNF dat bass <3
HD
my processor and memory sucks
Oh but first...that troll group...
GNAA?
fr4nky1: I never heard of*
Honestly, Watching back the chat reaction of today, it's kinda funny watching all of us react that way
Well they didn't do any real harm during the episode (I hope)
That's odd, I'd of thought that PS2 could recognise the 4000 series
My PC setup is getting kinda old
Hallo!
Some times I feel I waste my breath saying the logical thing to do with trolls
What did they have against Bronystate?
GNAA
how are things Randomnerd
MASF123 nothing, you know how people are
MASF123: They hate everyone and everything
Clipping!
they are trolls
MASF123: nothing they just do it for their lols
h-he died!
alexxm: Things are well, I hope you're doing well.
That answer your question?
MASF123: nothing really, apart for bronies existing
hope fully they dont hack again
...
i am Randomnerd
I agree with cachi01
SpadeMagnes[School, sometimes the right people hear it and don't respond.
I would love to have another hijack, and see what appears this time
So GNAA is a brony hater group?
http://ohn1ne.tumblr.com/post/36466170057/ive-made-a-terrible-mistake]
No
Hi huys
SpadeMagnes[School: no
...
r-dash; They will. They don,t have anything beter to do then ruining other people fun ;)
they will do it as long as it gives them a chuckle
Any1 Notice the Irony? They bully us on the day which shows a bully episode
SpadeMagnes[School nah, they love to screw around
They're a "glorified" group of hackers
SpadeMagnes[School, I kept hearing calls for everypony to remain calm and that the problem was going to be resolved shortly. I think this was the right thing to do.
:O
How did Bronystate handle it? Did the stream shut down?
nope
MASF123: They switched embeds
oh.
MASF123: stream stopped for about 2 minutes
05it was that easy
MASF123 I think a backup stream was used
I dealt with trolls many times, I learned to deal with them
It got back in seconds
MASF123 we just switched embeds
ok
T-this is scary!
Then I jacked that, and it was much much quicker that time
Was this during the Bad Apple stream?
it pays to have backups ;)
You just gotta ignore them, when they dont get a spark to their flame, they get put out and they go somewhere else
Oh, I see it. Dr. Hooves was dressed like a pear.
That orange was creepy lol
wrek what game w
I found it hilarious
Its Planetside 2!
This is why you always have other streaming options.
Yes, MASF123.
I just watched somewhere else.
I was digging that song
SpadeMagnes[School because most people are fickle :\
PS2 is awesome :D
Yeah, IIRC, they have around 8 embeds
SpadeMagnes[School: that works on a personal level, but not if they troll a group of people.
If you find this game intresting Go 2 Steam and DL it naow
It is
I'm going to go, be back later.
Cya
Bye Jageman !
PS2 SUC..Oh right, that PS2
05no P0N-3 thats why you choose one streamign site that knwos how to deal with bullshit ;)
Haha
AJIsAwesome: Well that was a funny troll then.
http://derpibooru.org/161541?scope=scpec5e2f27236f7804360dec876fc5195d9b5e72327
Hahaha
Ok back
The Pinkie orange
http://youtu.be/P0Ia1lmA5bg
i watched on justin.tv when the stream got hijacked
Well @Wrek, every week I watch I start here but I have 3 or 4 other streams ready in case something happens.
Just saying....wireless rifle for Planetside 2
Isn't this pony awesome??? :D
Azuredragon: Oh wow xD
Do anyone know which other stream they attacked?
Sonicrainboom_BOOM : Yeah, you do you realise that you took time out of your life to come to this site and write an insult. It just prooves that the people on the internet are even stupider than in 2011.
PON-3 me too
Isnt rainbow dash the most greatest pony ever :D (---
I read that you guys are getting boned as NC in PS2
whats that awesome music wrek?
Trolls I never understand
fr4nky1: Audioslave
P0N-3: This is the one site where you don't need to worry. I've been here long enough to know they're ready for anything basically
SpadeMagnes[School: ikr
:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D RD best pony
AJfan77: He's gone.
nekci menij next pleaase
vvolfsol0: dont spam
ladycanry: thx
They bothered coming here, hacking this stream to insult us...for what? You're wasting time you could be doing something else
First time IRC, will check myself before i wreck myself
05as someone stated earlier
Spam Spam Spam Spam oh lovely Spaaaaam, beautiful Spaaaaam. o/~
vvolfsol0 good call ;)
P0N-3: Yeah, the next time the hijack happened it was only like 10 seconds and they switched to LimeV
SpadeMagnes[School: trolls do forget that some of us come from 4chan
SpadeMagnes[School: All they have accomplished...Is giving us a new video to stream
<:
:D
05it is funyn that there is someone that spends more time ruining for bronies than the broneis do enjoyign the show... and then say the bronies have no life.
:D
:D
*/)
My son is watching the EP where Twily gets 2 tickets to the gala....It's awesome :D
vvolfsol0: awesome :D
Oh yea
I liked the song this ep!
/me /)*(\ SpadeMagnes[School
SpadeMagnes[School: Actually i might know y they did this, Looking back at this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ9vWulShds it's kinda amusing to watch us react that way
The song was very pop eighties.
My cat is really slumping, she's gonna fall if she#s not careful
i wanna cum inside rainbow dash !
^wut
pony_625934243: DUDE WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<pony_648161> why.....why say such a thing
Cool for you.. i guess
Get him outta here
/slap
pony_648161: go ahead
Don't pay attention, just a troll.
:S
whatever floats his boat
not really.
Hmm, speaking of trolls :D
I'd cuddle with Dash....but that's just jacked to share
Watuh undah teh brid3

Next episode is a Scootaloo ep, right?
It's more wierd then anything
!cd
Episode 5 of season 3 "Magic Duel" airs in 6 days, 15 hours, 16 minutes, 54 seconds (Dec 01 15:30:00 2012 UTC)

"Horsefuckers Hacked by U Mad Horsefuckers "
Phase4: Eeyup.
Hi! im scootaloo!
Lol. WTH.
Hi _Scootaloo_
Next episode isn't a Scootaloo episode?
Nope.

Damn, that's alot of tanks
with that name probably not
inb4 kicked for roleplaying
MAGIC DUEL?
TRIXIE EPIODDDDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:|
Yes, CrystalPhoenix.
Isnt it ironic that people who end up pulling this shit and saying we have no life, spend all time doing this shit?
Phase4 http://derpy.me/AZXRt
Oh boy shit is about to go down
You havent thoroughly enjoyed MLP till you have watched "Ponies Anthology 2" on Youtube
Oh! Trixie episode. Nice.
So...this hack won't happen again?
I knew it was one or the other.
MASF123, nope
I'll take Trixie too. :D
Oh its over1
MASF123: not likely
WOAH
So stream over?
Old school!
Not over yet.
Hey it's Phase4! :)
it was kinda scary
Hiya LadyCanary
ohai MASF123
MASF123 not really a hack, just a hijack, and probably not unless the GNAA feels like searching for every backup stream
Hi Phase4
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I still have those cards somewhere safe
IM SORRY I WATCHED IT! I KNOW IT IS NSFF BUT I WAS JUST CURIOUS! PLZ DONT BE MAD AT ME :'(
So was it just us? or Mips in entirerly
Hey Wrek, is there something being streamed after this or is it the end?
_Scootaloo_ why would we be mad.
About 80% of brony sites
|He said Jack's coming up
Mainly MIPS users
Screw MIPS she is a dirty cheating whore.
00,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT, if that happens in the next episode it'll be XD
Don't trust her anymore.
00,02anoying really, asside from the ads i liked mips
wtf is _Scootaloo_ talking about?
Maybe Trixie is getting a chance to redeem herself?
MASF123: Now now, don't be mad at MIPS
00,02it autostarted streams so i could suprise you all with loud music
and then we will hav Card Games in MOTORCYCLES
Phase4: Adblocker :3
I hate MIPS
:(
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: FAK YEAH
00,02Serenity, never leave home without it
-sniff sniff-
Dang, hearing about today's events has got me a tad depressed.
P0N-3: Given the title...Im guessing no
Snort snort
gak
Wait, uhhh
/me stretches
00,02MASF123, the kickscripts are still running :P
Gak
Tak is worst video game
don't say the g-word :x
God damn it...
sorry retype that.
00,02MASF123, i pinged you with an important message, now you dont get to see it
What word, Uakh?
I didn't understand the g4k meme, but my wife just explained it to me....lulz. I bet the company that produces it sure loves Bronies now.
NoBrony -sniff- likes me
Gangsta?
Damned.
Phase4: GG
sonicdude558 That game was my childhood!
UNCE UNCE UNCE UNCE
Tak is a fun game what you talking bout'
This house music is pretty neat.
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta DashWithRainbows
I risk getting virus, and i find this "Bronies are terrified of the GNAA. This is mainly due to the GNAA's ruining, leading to shut downs, of canterlot.net, and later fimfiction with NCF. That topped onto the endless spamming of ponychat, canternet, and ponychan gave the Autists a good reason to hate all things gay and black. "
It is pretty nice
rainbow dash?!?!?!?!
Phase4: you told MASF123 the important thing i told u to tell him right?
Phase4: Plz tell me
_Scootaloo_ if you wanted to RP you choose the wrong place, just saying
I wanna play a pony first person shooter.
cachi01: no he didn't.
Metronome: The hell?
00,02Metronome, wait canternet?
MASF123: damn dude im so sorry :(
what?
if any more hackers come i will love and tolorate the shit out of them
00,02i talked with the guy who ran that, it didnt go down cause of them
P0N-3: get TF2, install pony mods TADAAA
Sweet icon down there Wrek
Am I gonna die of cancer?!?!?! :O
ehhhh.....
gák
:>
oh.

00,02maybe i'm thinking of something else, google brings up an irc network
No I mean a proper one, built on the show and world.
:'(
With magic and stuff.
-_(\ forget wht i just posted
Metronome: Where did get that from?
oh no here comes wrek's face
I sense Jack incoming
(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ Stop with g4k
Enough gak
Just how serious IS this GNAA thing on brony sites?
^
I discovered fimfiction yesterday, yay \o/
_Scootaloo_ don't even know you to begin with
samurai jack time again?
Some Virus website
00,02Kandarihu, an anoyence at most
They should ban every G A and K word.
I believe so Welsh_Pony :333
Sooo many stories on FIMfiction.
Wait what happened to Fimfiction?
:)
MASF123, that would be going too far.
00,02also i cant spell
If I read fics for the rest of my life, I'll never read even half of the stories on FIMfiction.
Phase4: We realised
Kandarihu: They just have no life is all.
Oh yes!
YES!
Here we go
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Yeah, Samurai Jack! ^_^
I like the gnaa, they keep the ircops in shape with the k-line training

Deacon: I think this is it, but not sure

Young Jack.
No one cares for them.
00,02Uakh, should be on limev, you might need to press play
Uakh: Are u having"We are doing maintenance, will be back soon."
Scootaloo, the problem is the roleplaying. Just chill and chat, dude.

Nyst: Because only Jack's sword can kill Aku
Forget Jack, I wanna see a movie just for the Scottish guy.
Lol
cachi01 eh, bounty hunters, won't be missed
Something like this happened to me once. I was in the mall the other day and some girl walks up to me and just rambles on about how her entire week was the latest gossip or somethin'. I just gave her a "Who the fuck are you?" look and she walked away. It was hilarious.
cachi01: nothin' but robots and bounty hunters on that ship.
The Scott was the original Demoman
superretroworld: Well, this is from years back. It's not that bad, IMO.
Nyst: oh good lol
Hi Scootsy_Pie and pony_5625
Jaws

Bad feeling is bad
OH SHIT

Bubblz
I wonder if a giant bear ate the Scotsman's leg.
Dude like....yeah. And stuff.
Nyst I didn't get the chance. She was there and gone in 10 seconds flat.
I remember now. This is a 2 parter episode and Tara Strong has a minor role in the second part.
No pun intended.
THey speak in Derpy's cutie mark?
there isnt an angry way to say bubbles
totally?
Kipkat07_USAF: yes there is
dat upward inflection in his voice?
like this
Gee. This guy who The Scotsman thinks is Jack has knowledge that Jack has no way of possessing.
BUUUUBBLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!!! :[
I'm not the GUY, guy!
Glub glub glub glub glub
no wonder her name Bubbles from the Powerpuff Girls
Hhi r-dash
every sentence sounds like a question?
Soooooo innnntereeeesting?
cause she was raise underwater
GreatNector: That makes no sense. And thats not why.
It sounds like the fishmen are being sick and it's making me feel sick.
Everyone wants a peice of Jack.
This won't end well.
why
BUBBLES, BUBBLES EVERYWHERE
Pop ALL the bubbles
:3
just keep swimming
GreatNector: Because she was named Bubbles for being bubbly and sweet. And PPG came out BEFORE Jack.

lol
Lol.
Alchemist: my exact thoughts
Tangobeast knows how to tango
no clue
He tried.
lol
Epic music time
nope
That Scottish Guy is Epic.
thats remind me why is her name from the Powerpuff Girls Blossom?
GreatNector, (¯\(°_o)/¯)
The Scotsman is such a bro.
Jack would be like "That is not me." And then suddenly a safe falls on the doppleganger.
the music of this show is fucking awesome
Like, no squel for him. Ever.
^^^^
Hi J_E_Smith71
derpy in the end we still love you

o hi wrel
Why oh WHY didnt they make a soundtrack for this
The plot basicly goes like this. The Officio assasinorum dispaches an eversor to terminate a lone chaos space marine of the Luna wolves/Sons of horus/Black legion, In the fight a rouge chaos spell by the marine send them both to you-know-where. The chaos space marine now has to adjust to his new life in equestria and find a way to deal with the assasin.
