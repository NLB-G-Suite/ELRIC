Sylandest: Sort of. Just not as interesting as I would like them to be.
Invi: .. thus pay back something of equvivalent value of the two curses.. xD
Airpuff *cough* mind control *cough*
Invi: you can sacrifice somepony! :D
Ninjazz: well, you're here now! That makes life all the more interesting! lol
Airpuff i can but i don't ^^
Invi: .. perhaps its bugged.. so you sacrifice.. the one you curse..
xD
Sylandest: Well, I do count this as one of the times I do look forward to. ^^
Ninjazz: as do I, my friend, hehe :)
Hell yeah Diablo.
Invi:lolol
sacrificing is not my style Airpuff.
Invi: you just curse, no sacrificing xD
Invi: You've performed enought pagan sacrifices to be considered a wizard.

Invi: wut? XD
alexxm: I drew another Discord picture. I am adding color to it now
/me higds |Discord| back :)
INVI FOR THE LAST TIME I KEEP SENDING YOU THE SAME PINGS AND YOU WON`T ANSWER THEM!

Derpy_eliminate, try a PM.
Kipkat07_Gambler: Not true gambling... Once you head to Vegas, you will be tested.

Kipkat07_Gambler: Easy tests. :|

Invi: silly willy nilly filly is best filly XD
Kipkat07_Gambler: yep.
Sylandest http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3222/ is best filly
Aaaaaaaah Kipkat07_Gambler
Invi: HNNNNNG my heart *collapses*
So goddamn true
brb
made me wonder how come they couldn't blend it in the Background
eyup.
probably because they use a lot of stock animation.
must eliminate Ninjazz
o_o
/me walks slowly away from chat
/me pokes Derpy_eliminate in the forehead "no touching Ninjazz
so, when something out of the ordinary has to be drawn/interacted, it looks off.
stay Ninjazz
that would be my guess.
Ninjazz: RUN. and dont look back.
/me pulls out a katana
Agreed, WallDives. I always noticed that aswell.
Stock animatuib you say?? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWKo5veKjVU
Ninjazz: Hoshimota
/me runs away... FAR away.
/me turns around and shoots Sylandest1 heads off with a gun
why so angry?
animation**
/me get's the AA-12 for defence
/me chases Ninjazz with a katana while dressed as a samurai
/me head pops back into place "That wasn't very nice..."
mind the RP people.
I was just 2 min afk and now you all want to murder each other?
lol
why?
ikr?
/me uses duct tape on Derpy_eliminate
I was just threatened. -_-
Invi: I got no idea. I blinked, and then rp
I think i reacted appropriately.
/me runs to the bunker
dammit forgot the cupcakes
mhp
/me hides with his trusty minigun of friendship in safety corner
Rikku379: i believe Invi has your cupcakes
mhp(mind:grrrrr)
yeah about that, I don't think we can RP a lot in here
yeah.
Invi: hand over the cupcakes and nopony gets hurt
Not anymore.
CrimsonPhoenix mods seem asleep
and yet they keep doing it.
mods are never asleep. just lurking.
But *cough* *cough* mods asleep...
just because they arent streaming doesnt mean they arent here.
as long as we don't overdo it it's fine
Mmmmh I kinda doubt it but hey who am I to talk
Anyway just a fair warning and all yaddayadda yadda
Im a samurai :3
/me disspears and teleports behide ninjazz and cuts off your head with knife
/me walks away
6_9
:O
Kipkat07_Gambler: im a shimmigami, i win
/me revives Ninjazz in a horrible pagan rituale
i'm so tempted to bail from this room...
must eliminate Rikku
because i`m mad!
Bankai
WallDives: Lurk.
Rikku379: I have a no-dachi sword and a naginata. I win.
i have tenza zangestu + sia no ma getsuga tensho
me = nerd
/me has no comment
Rikku379: me=no life
more like weeaboos.
what is a weeaboo?
|Discord| : nice
Not bad, |Discord|.
DUH DEH PONY DE- ERP!makeing Your head explode
Ninjazz: I find it horrible
Invi|omnonz, short story, someone who is deeply obsessed with japanese culture to the point of immersion, or someone who wants to be Japanese.
lololollolololo
peace
|Discord|: It's not too bad.
WallDives oh. lol i even know such people
Ninjazz: But I just don't know how I could make it better.
im not a weeaboo...not anymore at least
The flaw with them is that they either have never been to Japan, or met Japanese people.
|Discord|: Practice.
|Discord|: I actually like it as is
Y U ALWAYUS ON

Ninjazz: They're *normal* abilities. :D
the beginning was so dull that I couldn't get into it
WallDives: Sheesh..this place is a RP cloud..
but I promised myself I'd read it at some point
/me twixes
this past january, I said I'd read it during summer
ew books :<
I'm reading it
dull books
are everywhere
its not a book
Iron_Edge, yep. I'm almost willing to take over/under bets on kicks today.
anyways
almost.
GilDash: I used to sleep like you... :P
I'm thouroughly enjoying it
I'm scared I'm going to be just like the crazy fans who enjoy it
WallDives ok i bet with you ^^
Iron_Edge: The mods hate it when the chat RP's
cuz homestuck's fandom is the worst OTL
03if there's a movie, let me know
/me runs
hi Om
Sense? Oh what fun is there in making sense?
I like books if I have the time
/me noms on Om
NONE AT ALL
WallDives: If you start up tell me. I've got a bag of bits and im feelin' lucky >:3
|Discord| no fun
03same here, but that's never
alexxm: Exacttly
Ninjazz: I can't physically get by without 6 hours. Unless you want me to crash my car and never hear from me again, that is. :D
hey Om hows your day been
Om: -lol- I can tell. But at the moment it would appear there are no Mods awake.
Hello :D
alexxm: Its been about a minute long
|Discord| but without making sense we wouldn not know what doesn't make sense
GilDash: Don't do that... Get sleep. Sleep good. :S
Resonantwaves: /)
Iron_Edge, again, they're lurking, or busy.
Hey Resonantwaves!
hey Resonantwaves hows your day been
what is homestruck?
hi Resonantwaves.
And hello to you, Om.
Is it something you do with a baseball? :p
its been good! how are you? :D (O_O)/)
WallDives: And yet all this RP goes on and they say nothing...there going for a snipe ban -lol-...
hio Resonantwaves
homestuck
stuck, no r
oh
Homesuck!
I mean homestuck
Ninjazz: To you as well.
well
Invi: Then there would only be one or the other so what made sense would technecly not and...lets just sit down and say that making sense is borin
I'm actually amazed you've been on the internet and never heard of it lmao
Ninjazz: Yeah, I don't need anypony to tell me that. :D
there are so ,many ways to change the title
also, Hi Om.
Om: Hello. ;)
Maybe I've avoided most types of insane fandom
:P
it's one of those that you can't 100% avoid
|Discord| it depends on the perception ;D
howdy Om!
cuz the fans are /everywhere/
I've avoided it
i'm good Resonantwaves
GilDash, WallDives, greetings
I've never seen any fans
Ever :P
/me pets Om
I applaud you good sir
/me has also never heard of it until now o.o
today is the first time I've ever heard of it.
ALL YOUR FAULT :<
except I just stole that virgin mind from you
I'M SORRY WHERE'D THAT COME FROM
Nah
I'll forget it
xD
and AE :<
Man.. i ate too much >.<
03I haven't heard it either
AE

LOL DRF
See
03see
I would think would have
o_O
O hai GilDash and Om :P
We're cool
:D
03The only thing you truly can't be online without hearing of
Invi: Lets say if we go to a world ruled by me. It would not make sense to you but to everypony else it makes perfect sense. So it is the oppiste way around
03is MLP :P
Airpuff: Holla. ;)
you're the anime person, plus you're on DA
yeah
what did you eat Airpuff
03just about everything else
03you can avoid
> Anime
03XD
> Da
13I'M SORRY LOL, but nope I've never heard of it before xD
that explains it.
Airpuff: And now you have a wicked bad tummy ache huh?
alexxm: Tikka masala.. xD
03EW DA
angel I'm sure you've seen some of it
Iron_Edge: pretty much >.<
it hits front page quite often
Airpuff: I don't fucking blame you. Curries are too nice. :)
I haven't touched DA in a year :D
03same
GilDash: mhm -.- I hate it
you've seen the gray people with candy corn horns? or the zodiac signs for that matter
GilDash: One does not simply eat a normal portion of spicy food..
is it Invi
it is alexxm
since when
What type of weird religion worships those things o-o
Boo!
13doesn't sound familiar |D
Airpuff: Yes they do. Try a sodding vindaloo. *That's* crazy.
:P
GilDash: xDD
Or don
How's everpony? :)
Invi: Make me lie while I eat muffins coming out of my ass.THen you an sing Polka face while eating those same muffins.
hey Petrified_Discord hows your day been
im good :P how are you
t eat spicy fppd
Hi everyone, how are you all?
lunac: Hai
alexxm: Kinda sucky. Found out I have a cavity :(
Om: Ima pretend you didnt say that.
Maybe it is a Californian thing
hey lunac hows your day been
Petrified_Discord: lawlz suckz for you
lunac: /)
Airpuff: You try typing upsidedown after you wake up
lol :D
/me hugs Petrified_Discord
Airpuff: 'Sides, Tikka Masala ain't spicy. :S
lunac : crap.
Invi gave up
I ;m okay thanks
I gave up too
Om: what? xD
Nothing due in then?
GilDash: Depends who's makin it ;)
Airpuff: Well, I could if you wanted me to. ;)
|Discord| nah i was just watching a PMV ^^ as we in our common world would see that as sense less, people who are used to it would perceive it as not senseless
6no?
6well
and yet it doesnt sound like food when you say it, Gil.
6fanime did have a homestuck gathering
6it lasted 4 hours
Airpuff: Just don't go for a Korma. I'll never take you seriously ever again if you confess to likeing a Korma. :D
6they normally last 1
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKkQNLmB6g Rainboy eye
Korma?
If something isn't senselss, does that make it senseful? :O
**Rainboweye
Invi: Perceptions are differing. Let me just say this. Something that does not make sense to us is generaly funny
Airpuff: It's the pansiest curry ever invented. :D
WallDives: Gillysuit cant make anything sound wrong
Still haven't heard of it
cant?
GilDash: that bad? xD
Om: You realise that's a double negative. :D
i have farted
WallDives: Typeing is hard
bye AE ;s
Airpuff: Yeah. I will force vidaloo down your throat until you're conditioned if you admit to that. :D
|Discord| making sense is just a illusion made by the brain so we are able to handle sensation
Invi: Dont use that psycological shit on me!
GilDash: Give me an hour, then my fingers will start working
GilDash: Okei i just read about it... seriously.... what were they thinking? -.-
Invi: It hurts my brain!
6waiiiiiit
If you're making "spicy" food.. Atleast make it spicy xD
Om: I only need about 10 seconds. ;)
who here knows a gobshite
|Discord|: You can't hope to defeat your enemy without understanding how they think :)
/me walks up to Discord
Airpuff: I assume they invented purely to weed out the weak. :D
GilDash: To get me to type better -_-
|Discord| [insert incredible evil laughter here]
GilDash: -.- yeah
Petrified_Discord: We are not fightin. Just having a friendly converation
Om: That's totally what I meant. ;)
What is everypony talking about
?
Om: Why are ya typin bad Om? xD
Invi: And if this was RP I would have turned you into a duck by no
|Discord|: Friends, enemies, same thing really :)
i have no idea lunac
Om: Buisy doing something? ;)

Invi: Woot indeed.
Iron_Edge, no, she has moments where she, and all of the other mane 6 need to be backhanded.
Bobeh why?
Ponies47: We all have out personal favorites, and most likely all of us sway against some of the ponies more than others, so.. in generall yeah. But for each individual person nay :P
Ninjazz: No idea. Love her now. Dunno why.

Ninjazz: I escape yet again!

Yellowquiet:

RAWRity: You mean....what's it called..

GilDash: And feel free to jump in at any time. :D
6WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
GilDash: what...but..how?!
6and did you get my text
10yes I did
OH! another series to stream: "Welcome to the NHK"
6which basically reiterated what I just said :'D
10but I saw it late at night
Sylandest1: My guess, Laptops
10didn't want to risk waking you
6hahahaha
6I was up way late
RAWRity: I want to stream tons of anime and movies I've seen but...Need mod rights for that. :P
Ninjazz, Sylandest1: I've got a very goo nose/ :)
6but you're smart
*good
:D
6waking me is bad bad idea :'D
Magical_pablez94: I hate sleep. It's a waste of time to me. That's why I stay up till or past 5:00 AM and wake up at noon :)
13Is it bad that I text people regardless of whether they might be asleep or not
goo...
10yeahhhhh
/me finds and drags Feather back to #SilverWins
Lol.
GilDash: you now have goo nose...XD
^_^ This is lovely.
derp
10yes angel
asdg
GilDash: I agree with that first mistype
13I might send texts at like 4am being all "LOL HOPE I DIDN'T WAKE YOU"
/me boops GilDash's goo nose.
Vordox: Then you should apply for mod duties next time they open up applications.
Ponies47: u lucky u can :D
03and they reply back "no, I was skydiving"?
Ninjazz, Sylandest1: Shush up, I've less blood then normal. :p
07and then that's all she says.
6^lol
(That's my excuse and I'ms ticking with it. :D)
RAWRity: Hah, my stuff is to ocontroversial. ._.
GilDash: hehehe
03it's from a picture :P
so, what's this show about anyway?
I like music 6_9
Vordox: what kind of stuff is it?
/me hugs GilDash
i think everyone is dead
GilDash: And I never get enough sleep. I don't think so... :)
Seen Scried, Elfen Lied, Trigun, Berserk? :P
Magical_pablez94: It takes time to get use to it. But once you do it's SO AWESOME! /)^3^(\ How do I do it? Lots and lots of soda! :D
03what the heck
03I swear this site is broken
03http://www.math.odu.edu/~bogacki/cgi-bin/lat.cgi
Elfen Lied is one good pony.
Ninjazz: No, true story, I gave blood yesterday. :D
It's alright.
03this thing is fricking useful for my homework
She ran away?
03but it keeps telling me everything I punch in is a basis
03when it's not
03o_O
did you get a cookie Gildash?
she passed on?
Vordox: Berserk's already on MY list. Trigun's not very controversial. Elfen Lied shouldn't be showed just because it's awful, not because of any controversy.
Ponies47: i just can't even if i want to. school is in my way. and my parents too.
07sure it is
Ninjazz: Now one day some poor soul will be infected with Gilly blood.
03LOL
03no but seriously
GilDash: I pray whoever get's your blood, doesn't become as "fiesty" as you. :$ Can't handle more than one of ya. :$
07you were just asleep during that part of the lecture
03I don't even get how you figure out if something is a basis or not
Om|reading: I see we were just thinking the same thing.
13elfen lied won't get a show cause it's over the top
Elfen Liedd is one of the best manga/anime I've seen O.o
07by being awake during that part of the lecture
RAWRity: I heard a lot of love for Elfen Lied. But I agree that it probably shouldn't be shown here.
magic guitar of wisdom?
03LOL
/me runs
03no but really
03this homework is due in like half an hour
no, wisdom guitar of magic
so that's why music is forbidden?
Magical_pablez94: I stay up till 1:00 AM on school nights! I'm on summer break now! :D
oh, i see
6_9 When did this start talking about God?
Thank you, Shizuka.
Ninjazz: They'll get over it... ;)
you vanish if you do epic solos?
07by googling how to find out if something is a basis or not
Om|reading: Hey, if I save a life it's worth it. :)
Elfen Lied is one of those shows that's just exploitative violence and sex, but tries to act like it's deep or thought provoking.
Gotta go, bye everypony!~ *hugs and brohoofs everypony, then dashes away*
i still have no idea what this show is about
03I already did that
Apparently these guys in the courtyard put this guy in a large cardboard box
00,03Later SonicTheStallion!
Im sure Ive asked this before, but has anyone ever seen Cromartie High School or BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad?
03this site lets you actually punch in the numbers
and he was walking around and hiding
welcome to anime Dark_Horst
Night everypony :)
13it's an amazing series, but the fanservice and copious blood and gore put it out of the running
GilDash: Yeah. I suppose.
LadyCanary: I've seen BECK
07also, why do you have homework due at 2:30

Hello Solid Snake IRL? ;D

i'm not going Sundaysmile
Zambambos!
lol sorry
Ninjazz: They would have to, in order to do it.
Rikku379 it's japan. why not?
It honestly baffles me that people try and get people into anime with Elfen Lied.
wasn't paying a lot of attention here
I totally agree Shizuka. Quite overrated. I wonder, would you ever consider showing EVA on stream? I've never seen it ._.
don't worry about it Sundaysmile
Ninjazz: I hope so. ;)
JAPAN
Bye bye alexxm :)

THe thing is
Ponies47 and Lil_B don't worry about it
THE NEW STUFF IS CRAP! :[
03Therefore the set S = {v1, v2} is linearly dependent. <- but when I put the SAME NUMBERS in the other thing, it says it's linearly independent
this is my pirate cannon. it shoots whole pirates
THe manga of Elfen Lied is one of my top 10, and that's after 500+ Manga read...
Unvi,Agreed
/me facehooves

13it was cancelled after the movie
YAY! I'm not TOO late for the Shizu stream :3

Airpuff: its the reason behind the show's name... Beats Wars... they landed on a planet, which just happens to be Earth, that had an energy source that was dangerous to their robot forms, so they had to take a 'Beast Form' to keep from getting killed by the energy
03bbl class

Guys, anyone know a good Fluttershy shirt for guys that I can wear to Bronycon?
Yah, just what i thought Hunter
11,01Sumi
dat trap
14I don't know, really. I just kind of feel it happening.
yay
6maybe when something better comes out
6but facebook is pretty solid
I kinda want one, cuz she's literally me as a pony, and female.
00,10bridge crew, hard at work
yeah
=_(\
rumour is they're getting in on the smartphones business now
Huh....how about I let you borrow my AWESOME fluttershy cosplay?
:s
no
11,01This reminds me of the first ep of Sealab 2021.
14I obviously can't explain myself, but everyone seems to be getting into Tumblr and hating Facebook more nowadays.
I don't cosplay. Sorry.
03who is
But that green dress looks so Kiwwi!
03wtf is tumblr
friendface
03isn't that just a site where people post stolen images?
Nittany_Discord: This reminds me of Sgt. Frog :P
*facebook
14pretty much
Nittany_Discord: you mean I, Quinn?
Lol jk, Wear a shirt with flutterhy "attacking" a bear
:D
03that's nothing like facebook :P
/me 11,01dusts Mish
ok mish, I'm lookin on welovefine
and next week gonna look at hot topic
14I'm not saying it's like Facebook, but you would be surprised in the transition.
But really, I had the best Fluttershy costume evear, and went to Nortwes con Got 8 brohoofs.
and theyre still in their swim suits :P
03yes but there are plenty of image sites, like Imgur
14All of my friends used to talk about Facebook, but now everything is about Tumblr this and Tumblr that.
/me sighs its 1am here already >>
03people who only use Facebook to upload random images are kinda missing the point
03well
/me presses all da buttons
03remember Google+? :P
lol
LOL
XD
14Who would try to remember Google+?
Hi guys!
3/get me a samich
What was that?
00,10the ballot was confusing I want a recount
03exactly
hay icybeauti
Haya geeky-brony
hai icybeauti
"theres....this man standing next to this woman, and they are just standing there!:
03and people like Articuno were all "OMG THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN FACEBOOK, EVERYBODY SIGN UP"
11,01She's a trans. Disqualified.
hi icybeauti
03and sent me an invite and stuff
03nope, nobody cares about it an ymore :P
Hey Michael and Dark_Horst
Stupid line #2
Dark_of_Max: Hi
Hes so horny....
This past weekend was the first time in my life that I ever really set foot in a Hot Topic. I was looking for MLP shirts, but I found nothing.
Nittany_Discord Sumica I think Celestia has a new enemy
>_< i was going to let this off as a normal contest because it was with full dresses
14I sort of respect Google+ in a strange way because it's advertising itself on my television screen.
COCKBLOCKED.
ha wlcom to the frend zone maein cartor guy
03the way I see it
14Granted, the ads aren't all that great, but and ad is and ad is an ad is an ad.
03the LESS something advertises, the better it is
03look at all the stupid comcast commercials
wat nao?
03and they're complete garbage
03:P
*shrug*
00,10fffffffff I have to take off a bit. Family issue. My brother is being stupid again
"Im five foot 2, my faviorte color is blue"= #3 stupid line
14Are you basing something's greatness off of whether or not it advertises?
6Academy of Art and Art institute
/me 6rolls
Thanks for logic!
03they don't advertise nearly as much as other colleges
03like Baker and all that
03:P
I know that feeling Sumica
Auroroll
6basically
fine Sumica
03There are obviously exceptions, but the more stuff tries to shove itself in my face, the less likely I am to actually consider it
Kandarihu: I go to Hot Topic for all my pony shirts. You can look online and get them shipped to your stroe.
03that could just be me?
better than Trollol
That entire conversation was to funny to mark as "stupid line"
03since apparently everybody here enjoys bandwagons
6the advertising aspect tends to come about mainly because they are trying to get more people, not because they are all powerful
or Swiss Roll
03I seem to be the only one actively trying to stay far far away from them
6common trend: those who advertise more seem to have less attention
or rickroll
So there are Hot Topics with pony shirts?
6for the very same mindset drf just showed
not funny
14I understand where you're coming from, but if I see a good ad then I'll more than likely be interested in what the product has to offer.
stupid line #4
/me forces you to watch WideOpenWest commercials nonstop for two days
6as it stands, facebook has nothing bad going against it other than what was going on with the stocks
03Now go sign up
03I dare you
03:P
Kandarihu: ya the one at the mall nere me got a carp tone
03I mean, OK
6yes people hate it, but it's extremely useful for a majority of the population
03I started playing Minecraft on my own accord and much later than everybody else started telling everybody to play it
03XD
/me pokes Midnight_Tempest
yeah the stocks thing
To be honest, there's a closer mall than the one that I went to.
6did you just start playing like two weeks ago?
they were all made overnight million/billionaires
My hot topic is full of pony stuff. But on second thoguht, I get most of my clothes there anyway, so I go often.
6cuz people were telling others to play minecraft about 2 years ago
anyways
then two days on the row stocks fall and they're getting sued if what I last read was right?
14I try to stay away from the bandwagon, myself.
/me pokes TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Ithat last panel
O_O
6I would hardly call facebook a bandwagon
that last panel.
*shrug*
14That is, of course, unless someone convinces me to do so otherwise.
Bam!
/me 11,01kirzstryfes
6my viewpoint on bandwagons is that if there's a use or entertainment, I don't give a rat's ass about the popularity
6if I enjoy it, i enjoy it
/me the streamer is now a hoomin, have fun!
hmm
03I didn't say Facebook was a bandwagon
6facebook, I think it's the most useful thing, I've met up with friends I thought were long gone, from like 12 years ago
03I mean things like minecraft
There is no beuty contest
03like the new stuff htat comes out
http://derpy.me/5zrfA dat pic
THERE IS ONLY ZUUUUL
6and even though a lot of my HS friends are across the country
03and everybody and their brother starts doing it
6we can still keep in contact
03and going OMG YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS
14I'm not calling Facebook a bandwagon -- I have a Facebook -- but I think it's not as amazing as everyone is making it out to be.
me personally I'd like to see the things I like become popular, then it means more people to talk about with it
1,3waaaaat
03Generally when that happens, I actively avoid wahtever it is
hence why we're here!
11,01Wuuuuuuuuuuuuut
/me runs
:V
agian
hai hai hai
again*
03I never said Facebook was amazing
hi?
asdgwg
03Heck
hai Derpy_Hooves
03It took me forever to get around to signing up for that too
wat
14It certainly hasn't proven its worth to me, especially with stupid games like Farmville making up a lot of Facebook's population.
WUUUUUUUUUUUUUT
03but that one was more because my mom threatening to kick me out of the house if I did
so I am breaking down and writing a fanfic
03er
6^then you've got the wrong peple as friends
6no that wasn't written right
03join the club, stupid PEOPLE make up a lot of the Earth's population
< stupid line #5
03Facebook has nothing to do with it
03:P
yah. its kinda obvious.
its based off of Sethiso's "a" fic :)
Again, gonna make a sketching of my OC for Bronycon 2012. Bitchin'

Tov|MoatEel: I jsut had pizza lol
ty for the images again
Fail!
14Perhaps you're right, Aurora. I haven't been what many would call "social" in these past few years...
of course lin won .-.
6that's efinitely a defining feature
03<Aurora> I guess for social people, facebook tends to be more useful <- see the funny thing is, I'm the most anti-social you can be and yet I still l.ike it
03xD
bye everypony gotta go bed
6considering facebook is the /social/ networkl
Night Michael.
12No problem Nick ^^
gnighr Michael
/me noms kirzstryfe
Hes going to die
6I'm extremely social based which is why I tend to like it so much
At least he will be happy
14I'm also not a complete shut-in. I used to enjoy Facebook as much as the next person. It's just now I don't like it as much anymore.
6I know a lot of people who don't care for facebook, but admittedly they don't care for socialness either
ponys are awesom
Is Scoot-Scootaloo around?
one thing I like about FB
Is any moderator around? I have a question.
03well, I hate Timeline, but I found a nice browser plugin to remove that crap
it acts as a good way to remember events and stuff since you get invites for them
6...
:|
00,03yeah?
6f*ing timeline
6can die in a fire
03you want the plugin?
agreed
sup Scoot-Scootaloo
kirzstryfe: lol, nice
03what I find hilarious
14I kind of like timeline...
6I only like the banner image at the top
03is that I tried to share the URL on my wall
00,03Yo~
03and Facebook was like
6the actual organization of the wall posts
03"This URL is known for spam, so we've blocked it"
6there IS NO organization
What Aurora said
meanwhile
03Spam my a**, they just don't like people abusing their site
a pony?!?
03but anyway
02EWWW TIMELINE
03www.timelineremove.com
03enjoy
12Basically, they should let you edit your whole profile layout
03It actually works too, or I wouldn't be recommending it
Whooo! I wanna be a pony...cat :|
03well
03I can see why they don't
00,03Well you need to be signed up for our newsletter via e-mail
oh
has the timeline been totally introduced yet?
12having the essentials stuck at the top
I'll do that
cos my page is still in the old format
mine is too
03that's odd
03well
03for me
02odd
pony video time?
10[20:19] <Soital> Basically, they should let you edit your whole profile layout <- inb4 Myspace, that was awful
:)
1,3just send an email to bronystate@gmail.com saying you'd like to sign up for the newsletter
03it was like "Publish now or wait until it becomes live on 5/26"
14No, Nick. I think they're still giving you the option to switch between the two.
03so o_O
12never had a myspace
03Nope.
12XD
03they don't
03also
03sites like myspace did, and I took that and hacked some HTML code together that basically redirected my profile to another page
/me runs
6acebook is phasing all profiles into timeline eventually
Im thinking of making a animation with my OC
03that's why the good sites don't you customize
good work kirzstryfe , on the drawing
ok SA but from what I understand they WILL be enforcing the timeline on all right?
03though I agree timeline should be an option
and lol acebook
03yes
After talking to Ghosties, I want to change my vote to Cape Fear.
I quite like that
6*facebook
03just install timelineremove
Irish_Pony: good luck im planning on making one also
*A movie*
03the catch is it does remove that huge banner at the top but whatever
ok thanks kirzstryfe
14I don't think they'll every completely enforce timeline because so many people seem to dislike it.
02EW mySpace
I WILL NOW CALL IT ACEBOOK FOREVER MORE COS ITS ACE
Is it okay if I suggest a documentary for B movie?
03it at least shows everybody's pages in the classic wall format
6SA
03you'd be surprised.
6it's happening already
03yeah
Irish_Pony: and its haaaard :(
03mine already changed :/
6a lot of people have had their profiles force switched
mine hasn't yet
03well
but it will
6it's been going on for like 6 months
ah
eventually >.>
03go log in
thought so :\
03and look at the top
03of your page
03it should say a date
03that it'll switch
03o_O
6I voluntarily switched so I could design my banner image
14I never noticed because I chose to make mine into timeline.
Only if its a science docu *not a mod*
o_o;
I might delete my profile when mine get's switched
03does it not show a date?
03mine did
hold on lol
6drf, if it's far enough, the don't display a date
03it said 5/26
6*they
03you sure?
6yeh
6mine never did
mmm
03mine let me choose to publish it
03well
/me is holding a mod
6I just siwtched cuz I could
Awww'
03<Aurora> I voluntarily switched so I could design my banner image
03that's why it didn't show a date
03:P
:'<
6but my friend had one and it was for like 2 weeks from that day
i want a documentary abut the dangers of eating money
03I mean if you intentionally DON'T do that
6drf
done and done
6it didn't show a date BEFORE
6duh.
I AM PEN
03They only started showing the date a week ago...
(goes now)
I know what I'm doing for a B Movie
6...
6no?
03yes?
cachi01: what program you use?
03for me at least
6thats been happening for a while...o_O
and an A Movie too
6like i said
03well then
03they must hate me
6they're doing it in phases
03but everybody does, no surprise
No stream?
fb isn't loading for me atm
and the two episodes
Irish_Pony: well its an IRL animation so im using fter effects
6people have been forced over since march
A documentary on the guy who walked that tightrope was… tight.
after
03weird
and Mish: nope, Sumica has "family troubles".
other sites are loading normally but I can't load fb
6once your profile is scheduled for a switch, it'll give you a date like 2 weeks prior
6is what I'm guessing
oh there
03ah
6same with me
did...somthing happen?
there's no date
okay not just me
14Why do they need timeline? I like it and all, but I also like having an option.
oh noes!@\
Well, I tend to have obscure tastes, so my perpetual suggestion of A movie might not come across as an A movie to a lot of people. It technically is.
03because they're stupid
A moive: a good movie that is well known
14It won't hurt Facebook to have both layouts available.
yes
I did
lol
B movie: a not so known movie of good quaility
03Sadly that's not true :/
Hello everypony :)

Hi everyone
If I can't suggest the documentary, I have something really trollish. But this documentary is something that I think everyone needs to see.
Lets waste time!
03but the group itself is just as bad
6I'm not even going to apologize for my spelling
Oh hey Phase4~
03because a bunch of bad people add up to a bad group
Yo, Nittany_Discord: have a request for you

Reikim: I though I was one of the few.
WallDives: Say what you will about 13, the soundtrack was as good as ever.
Reikim: ff13 main menu theme promise is one of my faves
cachi01: The true theme song of the game.

Reikim: I'm agreeing with you, everyone I know craps on it, and most of the game.
I see more saw. Time to see more deaths.
/me gives Failuane a ball-in-a-cup

Wait, what game is this?
thanks MAHBOI
FF-13 is awesome and no one can deny it
ALL of 'em!
cachi01: by FF standards, 13 is mediocre.
Failuane: ur welcome lol
WallDives: yeah but instead of comparing it to the other FF games
its pretty cool!
FF V is and will always be my favourite.
/me 11,01dusts Reikim
11,01Am I audiable?
/me sneezes
cachi01: comparing to other games, its a JRPG, and among JRPGs, its alright, not spectaular, as a FF game is expected to be.
Whats this game?

Nittany_Discord: You're a little quiet, I think.
Nittany_Discord: Ponies! :D
/me hugs PrincessLuna
Nittany_Discord: talk a little bit louder

They both break 4th walls, and both are invincible
He dosen't even sound angry

WallDives: OH PLEASE NO!!!!
WallDIVES. not WallDRIVES. DIVES.
only ones who can take Pinkie at this point are Hulk and Batman but only if he has time to prepare
Forget about the trap, the AI is so dumb that it didn't know it was being attacked>.>
Atopthe4thwall>dissaproves
Behold the IMPRESSIVE EFFORT put into this game.
Nittany_Discord: Sing at the gala to the atual song? please?
pff how could the Hulk defeat Pinkie? Batman, I'll concede.
/me is still trying to acquire a replacement hard drive for steam and his games
I give this game a 4/4
Failuane: Welcome to Atop the 4th Wall, where bad comics burn!

batman and pinkie would be a tie
bcuz Hulk's power is technically infinite

Rulk is alway the shiz.
pinkie pie is not annoying!
Rulk only gets hotter
SHE IS GREAT
....
AND FUN
NOT stronger
Pinkie Pie does not eat pinkie pie!
You know what this fame has had so far? A LACK OF JICSAW.
i liek batman eats a hotdog
Hey! he uses my faviorte rule to bad ai games: you can beat ANYTHING to death with a stick :)
cachi01 everyone annoys Hulk
rainbow dash thought pinkie pie was annoying at first
no. If the Hulk found Pinkie annoying, Pinkie would force him to smile. Thus defusing his power.
Also, whoever decided that darkness makes games better should be forced to sit in a completely light-proof room.
Failuane, you never played Dark soulds, have you?
Even HUMANS :[
mycutiemarkisagun: well hulk is another thing..... anyway hulk would just run away
souls^
IT'S A TRAP!
hen3ry, that's Pinkie's ONLY shot
FlareChaser|TF2: You there?
hen3ry: Mind ≥ Blown.
Whats "dark souls"?
00,10wth is with the mic overloads nitt?
mycutiemarkisagun: and then randomnly punch thor again
YES
Failuane, look it up.
11,01I have to boost my mic, or no-one can hear me.
ok.
Admiral Ackbar: Knows when shit is a trap!
ok
but attacking things with sticks is ill-advised.
12LMAO
Hello ponies
Failuane: What happens when you make a game where fighting is taken semi-seriously. As in, realistic odds of survival.
hi CupcakeWarrior.
12KFC IS COMING
12THEY ARE COMING
Guys, theres some kind of body cheese on my keyboard o_o
ponies?
12TO PWN MC DONALDS
Nittany_Discord: Sing us at the gala with music? :)
hi

i thought this was poundpuppieschat
12thats all their secruity?
WallDives: I know one thing to beat with a stick.... *Glares at One More Day*

happy music to tortuer

we're listing bad comic arcs, aren't we? Okay, the ORIGINAL Clone Saga
03OK so
My god, that singing is just amazing
03combine the wall of sound

WallDives: Justice League, Act of God!
03and that's an epic f' ing victory
aka the thing that almost killed Spiderman comics
i need speakers
BRAVISSIMO!!!
Nittany_Discord, are you high?
Blaze, AAAAAGGGGH.
And tonight on Bronystate, we play a horror-themed puzzle game while Nittany sings/plays fitting music.
GabeMoist: consider that he might not be. Consider that this could very well be Stone Cold Sober. And fear, along with us.
This is Saw, isnt it?
But instead of watching Ponies, and hearing frightned hoomins, I may not find a stream with friendship at all!
03http://hackedirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/epic-win-photos-clock-clock-win.png
CupcakeWarrior, it is.
Walldives: Oh! Amazons Attack!
SAW???? I thought it was Resident Evil.....
Your mic is kinda derp

At...the...gala? everyone sing togather now!
03I'd assume it would work
I'm hearing a lot of laughing, is he drunk?
Om, no, just crazier than normal.
14I'm pretty sure that clock would work one minute later.
thing
Om: Clearly you haven't been on Bronystate long enough. We don't need to be drunk to be drunk.
cant tell if he is crying or loling
sugar is best high
14Seeing as how not all of the clocks literally read the time it most clearly produces.
and one more for good measure : The original Family guy Comics.
who would win sumerpan or bamtan?
Reikim: You caught me, I havent been here for a very long time.
/me ''i gona die''
Pinkie pie approves^
14Don't mind me, though. I'm just a killjoy.
cachi01: sumerpan duh
Too bad no one is recording this
Nittany_Discord, sing So Many Wonders next
dude
Im singing while you are, and owning you HARDCORE
most depressing comic ever imho
CupcakeWarrior: I would if I wasnt laggin
So this game is not just prone to interface screws, it's also prone to MAKING YOU LOST.
>:)
Reikim: I lost the game
Reikim: could be Bloodwing.
CupcakeWarrior: Oh, you're so funny.

SayWhat, you play any of the dlc?
WallDives: nah, but I wanted to, I might have to go back to it... Actaully no. I'm waiting for number 2
according to black ops II the future is black
cachi01: Black cops?

SayWhat, meh. saves arent transferable. so...
WallDives: =/
WallDives: But I also wants the Guild Wars 2
I dont have a PC that can run GW2, so that isnt happening for me.
NOOO
/me is a scrubby console player
wait.. THERE ARE PONIES IN THIS?
Seriously, who designed this game?
The kids always fight over which is better... the xBox or PS3, then the smart ones get PCs
Reikim, Konami, obviously.
SayWhat, if you play fighters, you HAVE to play on console...
xbox = ps3 < PC
Well, that's a given WallDives
its a shame i dont have a good pc to play mah games :(
SayWhat, and thats 80% of my Library.
I also have a N64, so that is the best
N64 all day err day
N64 is PERFECT
Genesis. ALL DAMN DAY.

hi SunderlandPony89.
that start with S and ends with uperman 64
I have SSB64, Maro Kart 64, and Mario Party 64, each one is worth about 40 bucks. But they're kinda priceless to me
cachi01: If it was Sumerpan 64, it would have been much better
GameCube comes close, mostly because of PSOEP1&2+
02I have a few
02Going to try finding a job and I’ll also try doing some studying
Is this the Saw game?
CupcakeWarrior: indeed :D
I wanna play Pikmin now ._.
So basically this game is one long facepalm.
Reikim: Have you ever played Freedom Force? Lul
SunderlandPony89: /)
Again, is this the Saw game?
02I don't think anything could take up as much of my time as school did
02XD
YEah
Iron_Edge: (\
00,10looks like 573 to me
SunderlandPony89: Yes sir.
I'd laugh if the 3 number lock was 573.
Try 573!

I'm pretty sure it isnt, but i'd laugh.
Aww
Damn!
and bonus for anyone who gets the reference.
Woulda Lold

573 = KoNaMi
try all possible combinations until u find the one that works
thats the joke.
WallDives: I dont get it
thats how i found out this one
TheRainbowDash, ya there?
Eh, I'm gonna go now.
Oh, I didnt even realize you were playing SAW

WallDives: How does 5 = ko then?
so, Ko Na Mi.
02okay, that picture is messing with my eyes

Sumica: Oh mordin and thane died too....but I lieked legion....:(
Oh,Saw.Me and my sister played this before :)
Um....
He isn't saying anything, he's just kinda sorta struggling
Namco does the same thing in their games too. (765)
lol
00,10morden died?

DAT METAL SPIKE!
Sumica: Yeah he got shot when we were closing the door that jammed.
lol
He's screwed

How can you tell which one is the right one?
i liek how one of them gets through his mouth
Yay
Wait, what did I just walk into?
This might be a good time to google it Nittany

Xera, Saw.
oh god
XD
I dont get which ones are the right ones
he gona die
Cupcakes,Much?
Rawr
PEELZ
Clearly the way to cure self-imposed isolation and suicidal tendencies is by piercing a guy's body with metal spikes. Jigsaw's logic is infallible.
Sumica: Yeah it should. But before I go and get it. How did you get the dragon age armor? That stuff looked pretty awesome.
XDDD poor guys he is getting stabbed and stabbed xDD
Blood loss would have nocked him out by then I think
That guy should be way ded by now
WRONG FOOT!
lol janitors are health
healthy*
JUST DIE ALREADY!
Lol after so many spikes later
How can he move? HE HAS HOLES IN HIS BODY
HOW IS HE STANDING?
How is he still healthy after getting stabbed so many damn times!?
EEYUP
U SAVED HIM IN UR FIRST ATTEMPT?
Bow Chicka wow wow

YES!
LOL
U LUCKY
YOU DONT SAY
DUMBASS
ARE YOU BLEEDING?
NO SHIT
obviously the guy was on his period
He looks fiiiiine.
SHERLOK
saw?
Darkts3: Wut
No I'm not bleeding. I'm just standing here with holes in my body.
mo im not bleeding just pierced with many spikes thats all
just a flesh wound
Nah, it was Ash Ketchum.
Don't you hate it when you're pierced with many spikes?
tis but a scratch
Nittany is the best life saver ever xD
Happens to me daily
Nooo!!!
Is the burger ok?!
Um, what.

OH GOD. MANBEARPIG

|Discord|, Nittany refers to Pennsylvania, like the Penn State Nittany Lions?
00,10ow

Reikim: Isn't Nittany a gurls name?

11,01Shimmer :`(
You could put a billboard on them foreheads

13already did my time today
Do you SEE a Roseluck?
Thought so. So, I just read an artical about how parts of the US don't have basic broadband access and how the same happened with phones until the Government forced ATnT to do it.
They call him : the chick magnet
00,10baldness must be an issue in france
13i don't use roseluck anymore, more stable without her .-.
However, I"m of the mindset that the Government can't do anything right.
I'd still perfer to live in France over the US
Run dooogie
That dogs looks creepy 0_0
