Nopony even tries to help Rainbow
PROPERTY DAMAGE
why noone helps?

XD

12RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: When Rainbow Dash grabs the pony statue and runs into the pillars, it is similar to the Disney movie Hercules when Hercules runs into the pillars and knocks them over. The statue could resemble the pots.
:(
It was all a clever trick set up by Trollestia.
/me raises an eyebrow over a massive mug of coffee. "Eh?"
LOL
close enough
I was a simple question
trollestia's domino effect architecture
here it comes
If she had her rainbow armor she could have headbutted it away
quit misspelling glueblood
styrofoam statue
And in the ensuing chaos, Blueblood was crushed beneath a pillar.

12RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Howard Ashman and Alan Menken originally conceived the opening song "Arabian Nights" to be recurrent throughout the film, acting as narration. This idea was dropped when the visuals and storytelling proved strong enough in their own right.

Exceptionally Rare Apple?
dead sea tupperware?
4Yes, that's Robin williams speaking
OHHH
must have hawkeyes. I see no raisins
12RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The opening scene with the street merchant was completely unscripted. Robin Williamswas brought into the sound stage and was asked to stand behind a table that had several objects on it and a bed sheet covering them all. The animators asked him to lift the sheet, and without looking take an object from the table and describe it in charact
6Movie centered properly now guys?
wanttobuy that
That box was amazing!
THAT'S RIGHT
Oh, it's just a lamp.
Me? Sorry :(
huh
...I just stopped by your shop for some bottled water...
...
Robin Williams, lol.
Can i smoke the lamp
oh man
13n00baphobic LOL
no i was telling Dr Doozer what the topic of the convo was
So he's selling a lamp containing a character voiced by himself?
SirSprinkles its fine
I got carried away *sob

ORLY?
epic trivia is epic
its recursive
Its centered great
I heard a lot of this movie was actually improved from Robin Williams
4So this was all adlibbed, Silver?
Whenever I see a vender, I imagine he might be hawking red potions. Damn you Zelda.

Ooooooo, pretty.
What's so hot it's cool and so cool it's hot?
blood diamonds
its okay i shouldnt even talklol
sparkles!!
YEAH!
Good song, if I recall from TGWTG Aladdin originally ripped off the Thief and The Cobbler and The Thief and the Cobbler Ripped off Aladdin....man that's a weird type of animation inbreeding.
Why does that trivia not surprise me
You can put your weed in there.
everything begins on a dark night
How many hours long is this movie??
at 8
I like that comic.
So dark
And a dark outfit
6Centered nicely
Dark dark dark
just lookiin out
dark knight
oh so very dark
in 15 mins
Entire movie was adlibbed.
Robin Williams was hilarious in his prime
So the whole tale is voiced by a smelly merchant
Are you getting the trivia from IMDB?
dark man dark purpose
he reminds me of the guys who're always trying to sell you "beautiful watches" at the beach
How is everyone watching while talking?
7 hours
dat voice
now :(
That shit right there is why Robin Williams is AWESOME
wahahaa
the movie is more racist than we are
YOU ARE LATE
I can only think of Kingdom Hearts right now :/
yeah williams used to be a lot funnier
Robin William's improv on that scene was pretty good.
best disney villain ever

SPOILER, Aladdin wishes to become a prince. Spoiler, it comes true
12RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: This is (as of 2006) the only traditionally animated film to be nominated for the MTV Movie Award for best picture.
5They got kinda old. ^^;
Don't disagree with Celestia, Jasmine.
RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Jasmine loves Aladdin, and eventually marries him.
You said there would be ponies? Where are the ponies Robotnik?
dammit poppah wants grandkids
The sultan = Fluttershy
And then Rahjah ate Jasmine. The end.
I think Jasmine is closer to fluttershy
I know right.

oh cool
the actor playing the saltun actaully looks like that, kind of

OOOOOO
Random movie trivia: The cave of wonders still freaks me the **** out
ALLAH?

Princesses are tp mainstream

Daughters? Pfft

:3
That's actually harsh
someone needs to make a pic of ponies dressed as Aladdin characters.
children? what's that? says raja
SHE NEEDS A PERSONAL ARMY
Oh god
5And female characters were usually portrayed as being either very nagging, demanding, or desperate.
OH right, Disney girls always want more in their life, YOU ARE F****** RICH AND YOU ALWAYS WANT MORE YOU GREEDY PERSON
DarkHorst: She needs a grizzly bear.
ALLAH FORBID
Song denied!
Raja. Secret But Fun?
iz so haught
They're fucking taking off
RD is totally Aladdin.
Oh thank god
Random Movie Trivia: Many characters in this movie are Muslim.

/me runs!
@Metal Link I know right?
DUN DUN DUNNN
12AWESOME MOVIE TRIVIA: Scheduling conflicts with "Star Trek: The Next Generation" (1987) forced Patrick Stewartto turn down the role of Jafar. He has said in interviews that this is his biggest regret.
yeah, he certainly looks trustworthy
5I can't watch Snow White anymore. It just kills me inside.
Yiffar, my most trusted advisor
Trollestia is Jafar
I want to see what the others look like.
SPOILER HE IS THE ANTAGONIST

WHAT THE FUCK?! Patrick Stewart was going to be Jafar?!

Whoa... Picard as Jafar?
Something i couldn't stop thinking of: Is it legal to stream the video like this?

Biggest regret ever...
Jasmine had a song called "I'm More Than a Peacock Princess" with Iago.
WHY DIDNT YOU DO THIS SOONER
CONVENIENT DIAMOND
Jaffar looks trustworthy
Silver, EPIC TRIVIA
Hmm so it seems chrome was lagging...
i will now call him jaffa
5Mulan is great though.

JAFFA CAKES?
He trusts him cause hes hypnotized.
What's with this sta--ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOSTAFF
5The fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiirst Disney movies.
These are not the droids you're looking for
Hypno Staff is nothing in comparison to the Hypno Toad.
No.
JAFAR EVIL? NO WAY
Jafar is a diamond dog
His toys are freaking awesome!
No I'm not.
Sorcerer...
12RANDOM JAFAR TRIVIA: Jafar at first was more hot-tempered, while Iago was a cool, haughty British type. The filmakers felt that having Jafar losing his temper too much made him less menacing, so the personalities of the two characters were switched around.
*Stabs*
13Ah yeah, I get what you mean xD
Pony trivia is harder to find
Those damn mind tricks
His mind is racked
give diamond to some one you barely know with dark magic, seems legit

12RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The second Disney animated feature to use fully rendered and textured 3-D CGI moving backgrounds in combination with the traditionally animated character animation, a technique that was expanded upon in the Disney short Off His Rockers (1992) and previously in Beauty and the Beast (1991).

PROFESSOR! LAVA! HOT!

11Robin Williams provided the voice for the Genie, at union scale rate (the lowest legal pay rate a studio can give an actor), on the provisos that his voice was not used for merchandising (i.e. toys and such) and that the Genie character not take up more than 25% of the space of a poster, ad, billboard, or trailer. When these wishes were not granted,
11. When these wishes were not granted, he withdrew his support for Disney and the film. As a result, his name was not included in "The Art of Aladdin" book (it makes constant references to "the voice of the Genie"), and he was not available for the direct-to-video sequel The Return of Jafar (1994) (V) or the "Aladdin" (1994) TV show (Dan Castellaneta filled in

11In an attempt to get back on good terms with Williams, Walt Disney Co. CEO Michael Eisner apologized to him with a peace offering of an originalPablo Picasso painting. Still angered and feeling betrayed by Disney, Williams would not accept the gift.
Robin Williams is a pretty cool guy
11It was not until Jeffrey Katzenberg was fired and a new producer hired did Williams return to Disney. Through this new producer, a public apology was given (by the producer).

But Fezzes are cool. >:|
5Well that's interesting lol.
Cats are terrible creatures
I had both games.
11Promises were made to right wrongs, and Williams was so touched that he came back as the Genie for the second direct-to-video sequel, Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1995) (V).

11RANDOM SONG TRIVIA: Eight other songs were written for the film but were later removed. Some of the original songs before the story was rewritten and half of the characters were cut: "Proud of Your Boy" (supposed to be sung by Aladdin to his mother - later removed from the story - while she was sleeping);
KISS HIM, YOU FOOL.
11"Call Me A Princess"; "Omar, Babkak, Aladdin, Kassim"; "Humiliate The Boy" (sung by Jafar, cut as it was considered too cruel for the film); "High Adventure"; "Count on Me" (which was something Aladdin sung to his friends and family, then it was changed to "A Whole New World").

But, in 1991, Ashman died, and the story problems stalled the film. So, the plot was reworked to be about a teenager, Aladdin, seeking self-respect instead of the approval of others

11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Originally, the peddler who introduces the movie would be revealed to be the Genie at the end - hence the fact that Robin Williams voiced him, too. Notice the similarities in the design of the two, especially the eyebrows, the beard and the four-fingered hands. (All the other human characters have five fingers.)
He ate them...and hes going to eat me!!! OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDD!!!!
*sniff* that was beautiful*
11This concept was used in the second sequel, King of Thieves, as a means to round out the Trilogy.

then he leaves all the gold, and rarity doesn't notice
I'd vote for her.
Celestia is teh troll

Fluttershy has a very high Charisma and speech stat
i'd vote for her
Day-umm.
