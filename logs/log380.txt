Not sure, MirrorImage. All we know is that the Ursa Minor lived in a cave, and it was a constellation. If constellations live in caves, bears must live in the sky.

NO IT IS NOT! SHIPPING PONIES ARE LIKE RULE 34
/me prepares to rull MirrorImage out the door
Shipping ponies is like rule 34. Sounds legit.
>Shipping ponies >Rule34...
Anyway, I never really liked shipping between the mane 6. Not like I'm against it or anything, just...It never really appealed to me.
I guess..
:'(
Pretty sure there is a LARGE difference.
If shipping was 34, then most of fimfiction is rated M
I've chosen one that I can enjoy, but other than that I don't really write or read much shipping.
^
THIS.
Okay define rule 34 ship...
Define it now
Well shipping is like love and R34 is like sex.
/me shrugpony
Exactly
Rule34 is Hentai. Shipping is Romance. Romance is not Sex.
Just saying.
Not entirely, anyway.
It can be.
Oooo..

Man, isn't that game done yet? ._.
Ok, best Zombie game: Left 4 dead, Killing floor, or Dead island?
CriticKitten: hopefully it'll be wirth the weight.
L4D
/me wishes there was an mlp dating sim
plants vz zombies
I feel like I've been waiting for it for years. Though maybe that's just because I actually HAVE been waiting for GW2 for years and some of that anticipation has been boiling over into other games.
GW2?
I liked Dead Island, never played Killing Floor, L4D is awesome (if team is good). So L4D for me
Waiting, foreeeeeveeeeer.
People still asking for them to play as different ponies...MEANWHILE, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN: Livestream begins at 8PM. THIS IS NOT LIVE!
fffoooooorrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeevvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeerrrrr
this one time in band camp......
Thehated, I prefer Killing Floor for instathrills but L4D for building a good team and playing for srs
^TrueJake
Yup
I haven't played L4D properly in forever.
Cavy: what stream?
L4D is now a bronystate approvedd Zombie Game
Release Date: Soon and that was from September 2nd
if not already
FiM stream.
http://www.livestream.com/mane6

It is a fun game. ANypony up for a quick campaign level?
I would if I had it with me.
=P
don't own L4D
Unless you mean on PC.
only have it on xbox
Xbox?
/me spits.
I dont do PC gaming
I got it on sale for 5 XD
i do have killing floor but i'm new to it so i'm really bad
PC gaming is afar superior to Xboc
Nah.
Depends on what games though.
why haven't they finished fluttershy yet?
omg let the flame wars begin
PS3>Xbox 360
Nope.
TheGreatandPowerfulT I got it 5 dasys ago XD Lemme know If you want a friend to learn with!
yes, but my laptop is not up for gaming, i still need a decent one
Krakass: Guild Wars 2. I'll refrain from doing my usual excited fanboi stuff though.
:p
nooooooo... don't go there...
PC> ALL the consoles!
Ahh, ok.
Ok, PC gaming is superior on decent hardware
i got it to in that sale, add me :p
Same steam name?
yep
Xbox360=PS3. They're both great consoles. If you're a FPS guy, get an Xbox. If you like racing/Spots, get a PS3. Xbox tends to be more competitive in FPS.
Again, both good at what they do.
hmmmm yes quite
Send trixie
<Has both. Bought them myself.

I got an XBox, but there's nothing stopping me from getting a PS3

CountDoofus: what does the US get on the 6th?
Meanwhile, I played a campaign on a server with 3 euros yesterday., Had a pong of 260. XD We can still try
heck, I can occupy myself in the meantime
mario_pony, Mass Effect 3
still playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
what's it about?
mass effect
Jaketehsnake: it's prone to connecting to a map, killing my connection during transition to the next, and then faffing around with my net while I try to make it play again.
a super sentient race comes over to wipe out all living things in the galaxy
^ That
is it hard?
Ah yes, "Reapers" The race of sentient starships allegedly waiting in dark space. We have dismissed that claim.
Meanwhile, Faffing around, that doesn't sound good. You should start the game so it picks the best server for your connection
hello Reapers, lol

Zappy: no what I'M doing is for science
OUR VOLLEYBALL TEAM
FTW!
what kinda science? dark matter, atoms etc
Paradise92: ease up on the caps lock
Paradise92: I highly doubt that Einsteins WIFE was responsible for the Manhattan Project
08,01emangamer|physics: you can think of it like the difference between charge and current
spiritwaffle: we'll be doing dark matter in about 2 monts
08,01except it's nothign liek that
yay
/me cant wait for modern physics...
otakon actually that is still under the question...
08,01modern physics is best physics
08,01and oh so screwy
ill be back in a little bit guys but for now goodbye
otakon but remember
Paradise92: bumpkiss
08,01emangamer|physics: oh baby, oh baby
13why are we kissing bumps
08,01emangamer|physics: it's the only kind of young's slit i like.
08,01*horrific rimshot*
13bad joke >:I
otakon Einstein wasn't the only scientest = mass murderer that was being under the Manhatan Project
Paradise92: that is harsh
emangamer|physics: why are you studying physics?
otakon say what you want the facts are there...if they didn't invented the Atomic Bomb there wouldn't be Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Shizuka: the force on a while carrying 8.75 amps is a maximum of 1.28 N when placed between the pole faces of a magnet. IF the pole faces are 55.5 cm in diameter, what is the approximate strength of the magnetic field?
Paradise92: no I'm not saying that, but it's not like Einstein liked doing it
who invented it....
otakon then why did he did it??
emangamer|physics: I am at a loss for words
08,01emangamer|physics: just remember: schroedinger's cat was meant to *disprove* the Copenhagen Interpretation reductio ad absurdum
13four horsepower
Paradise92: if anything to bring a end to the war
Paradise92 , the other way round , if they didnt drop the bombHiroshima and Nagasaki would still be there
08,01not that you'd be asked that in an exam...
silly Shizuka the units are in tesla...
TrixieMuffin and we would talk in Japanese now :D
night guys
HI!
Mane6 stream going live now
Yes, the atom bomb was a wonderful invention.
13the answer is nikola tesla
otakon: because I have a test monday
Shizuka: that actually sounds right :D
silly Shizuka
where nikola is a constant
Otherwise the invasion of Japan would have been much more costly in human lives.
/me 08,01is pleased with emangamer's physicsness
d'awww
08,01emangamer|physics: is this for school or uni?
emangamer|physics: okay, curse my lack of taking physics in High School
13i slept through high school physics
lol no ? Japan was already finished by the time , the bombswere merely a show of force
13canary~<#
LadyCanary: <3
Ohai Shizuka :3 hi all.
That EQD post....
DAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Shizuka: this isnt high school physics :/
08,01emangamer|physics: do you enjoy physics?
emangamer|physics, i demand pics so i can judge this for myself...
08,01emangamer|physics: yes it is
see u guys later
Bye alexxm
08,01i did all this in high school
bye alexxm
alexxm: bye
hiya LadyCanary how are you today?
08,01maybe we do it different to you in scotland...
08,01seeing as we're such a powerhouse of innovation
Krakass and otakon: screw it just forget it i give up
mario_pony: don't give up!
mario_pony: go into your network settings
08,01emangamer|physics: ah. so you're studying this at uni now?
I'm so happy. I found out I only have to do 3 out of 4 response papers during this semester for a class and Im deciding not to do this one because it's really freaking difficult. I think I made a good choice.
Estimates of the US invading Japan was as high as 500,000 US soldiers. Jpanese would have been even higher.
08,01emangamer|physics: is it your major?
mario_pony: tell me if you have internet connection enabled
What about you otakon?
otakon watching Mane6 stream and there will be Online Mode for Fighting is Magic :D :D
LadyCanary: okay I guess
powerhouse of inovation?
brb checking something
LadyCanary: well thats GREAT news!
6_9
08,01Paradise92: sure
/me throws a party for LadyCanary
._.
I-it's not a big deal.
http://www.livestream.com/mane6 !!!! ONLINE MODE ENGAGED!! YES THERE WILL BE ONLINE FIGHTING WITH PONIES!!!
08,01emangamer|physics: ah, okay
the two powerhouses of innovation were UK and Austria
LadyCanary: any reason for a party is a good reason
bye Paradise92
I'm just happy I can do the other ones with ease.
Because I UNDERSTAND IT.
ummm...why bye?
Jaegerpony: Austrailia? and the UK? IN WW2 ERA? YOU are insane
oh shit...not only do I have to study, but I have to write 3 mini papers...this will be a FUN night -_-
08,01LadyCanary!
Do it filly
Wubz.
emangamer|physics: you can do it!
/me 08,01hugs LadyCanary
Ahh a quick cold shower feels so nice
Austria =/= Australia
hi everyone~
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: get shot down?
Ay BRB I gotta babysit. Be riiiiight bac~
Austria, not Australia
/me waves giant foam finger around rooting for emangamer|physics
hehe
otakon: I cant work if you keep DISTRACTING ME!!!
Jaegerpony: oops, read it as Australia my mistake
emangamer|physics: then get off the STREAM!!!!!
otakon: THERE ISNT A STREAM....take THAT...

Night Zappy
Now I'm forced to post this in reply to Shizuka's comments: http://sciencefun.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/snakes_on_a_plane.jpg
otakon: it's 3.72
CriticKitten: that is amazing
they should do a Double Pinkie attack for that Fighting is Magic
CriticKitten: thats going on my tumblr
mario_pony: here's what I want you to do
otakon: how can i update?
08,01zomg
08,01fighting is magic
mario_pony: turn off your PS3, hard reset your router, turn it back on then go through the automatic setup for your PS3
Lol pinkie pie has a move that destroys the 4th wall
08,01pinkie is just so cool
eman: inorite
bye everypony...I have SCIENCE to do
mario_pony: you'll have to dc for at LEAST 30 seconds
otakon: how do i reset my router?
mario_pony: and when I say hard reset, remove the battery pack and unplug it
Laters emangamer|physics
mario_pony: unplug it and remove the battery pack
08,01woo
http://www.livestream.com/mane6
mario_pony: then after about 30 seconds reconnect it and let it power back up
I fefuse to watch that because spoilers
bye otakon <3
bye emangamer|physics good luck
/me nuzzles otakon goodbye
*shrugs*
Jaegerpony Pinkie Pie is God Tear !
/me RUNS LIKE HELL
heh well she can break the 4th wall
eeyup
and catch up with anypony
Jaegerpony and that is her Move dammit :D
^^
that doesn't surprise me
mario_pony: you back yet?
...and now Rarity
Will it be for consoles only?
...
no
Jaegerpony: no, it's PC only
it is a PC ame
game
oh good
I wonder if they could release it on XBLA.
*doesn't own a console* (unless you count a Commondore Vic20)
Jaegerpony: it's a 2D fighter, I don't think keyboards are too good for that
otakon: where is my battery pack?
It supports a bunch of different controllers.
that's why I thought a console game
mario_pony: check underneath the router for a panel to remove that is where the battery pack should be
I guess I will have to purchase a PC controller thingy
mario_pony: otherwise just unplug it and let it sit for 30 seconds then plug it back in
Jaegerpony: download libusb to play using 360/ps3 controller
Jaegerpony: they're inexpensive, plus you can just use a Xbox 360 wired controller
really?
they plug into PCs?
You can also use the xbox 360 wireless controller if you buy the adapter
aah
didn't know that
Krakass: but that's more expensive so WHY BOTHER?
Special Move better be Tom.
=D
Because I already have wireless controllers and not the wired ones?
I have a question
I choose you CupcakeWarrior
How good is ubuntu compared to windows?
I guess I can steal an old wired controller from my nephews
Depends what you want to do, cupcake
Just performance wise
otakon: there do i plug it back in?
Its fine. The main issue is if the software you want is available on it.
I have an old tablet PC with Ubuntu on, and a theme that looks just like win7
It's a little less hungry than windows. but not much
Ubuntu is a heavyweight in Linux
mario_pony: the same plug you pulled it out from
there are lighter distros
mario_pony: all your doing is hard resetting the router
oh
mario_pony: just make sure to save any work your doing first
You're still online while your router is unplugged?
and downloads or such
wait
damn it
I like Ubuntu a LOT, but I need windows for some programmes to run, and little free apps I use
Can I just run ubuntu off the disk?
give ubuntu its due though, it worked straight away, installed from USB, installed everything
Yup
liveCD will run
use the internet etc
no change to PC
Does it replace windows?
otakon: why didn't you tell me a
not unless you ask it to install
k
haha AJ is like Scorpion...
otakon: does that mean my save files were deleted?
mario_pony: tell you wat?
Ya'll get over here.
mario_pony: your disconnecting your router to reset it
I can't wait for Fighting is magic .__.
pull plug out of wall?
mario_pony: you know what, don't do it nevermind this is impossible without being there in person, you fucked atm
I so want Fighting is Magic and PonyKart.. really bad
When will they be done with Fighting is Magic?
Soon
Wait
They look close to beta from this example
Is PonyKart a real thing?
Yes
At least as far as I know it is.
OH F*yay* YES
It could be an elaborate prank.
There's development ongoing as far as I've seen - no reason to think it's not going through
mario_pony: and as for updating your PS3 just look it up online, you can download the update to a USB Flash Drive (if it's big enough) and then run it from there.
It's a hell of a lot of work for a prank
People have worked harder than that on pranks before
and they'd make a ton from it
just saying
Like pretending to be a staff member for FiM
pull prank or get rich
They're not charging for ponykart
otakon: wouldn't it of been easier to tell me that in the first place?
and facebook doesn't charge either
but they're still raking it in
there is always a way to make money
mario_pony: yh, but I didn't realize this would be like assembling a jigsaw puzzle in the dark
lol
mario_pony: it shouldn't be this damn hard, LOOK IT UP ON GOOGLE
That's because facebook sells all their info about you to advertisers.
yup
Sccary stuff
it's NOT setting up a damn LAN, it has AUTOMATIC setting to connect to the internet
which means if that's not working your PS3 is busted
and with Google's new privacy policy -they can link ALL their seperate info about you into One Big Profile
yay
but i only had it for 2 months
o.o
Just wondering did we start with having mario_pony disable security on his router?
I reckon it's firewall or something
Jaegerpony: That means youtube tracks you too?
oh yes
massively
0_0
watch this - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7yfV6RzE30
it's about what Google is doing
Something tells me Twilight might be a little OP for being a magic based caracter.
ironically it's hosted on youtube
OP?
overpowered
hello everypony!!!
derpy needs 1/2 cups water to make a tray of muffins. if derpy has 1 3/4 cups of water, how many trays of muffins can derpy make?
I'm sure they'll balance it with testing
I'm sure they'll do a ton of testing to get an even balance
heh
I hate fighting games but I will give it a try
great minds, krakass
when it comes out
Indeed.
like my math problem?
Gold: She doesnt need too make muffins, because shes so epic that whenever she has a daw moment she automatically makes muffins come out of her derpy eyes.
^
its a piece of cake to bake a pretyy cake~
And that was the physics of derpy with aircrafter. Come again.
"If you have something you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place" - Google CEO
Uh.
:s
Then I guess I should probably stop being a brony...
Yeah, I'll watch the game when they've actually decided on stuff. :p
NEVER NEVER NEVER"
Dont stop being a brony
Oh wait, you cant stop being a brony :P
The trick is to get EVERYONE to become a brony -then it becomes normality
hi everypony
I would like too see the president of the U.S. Or any important country become a brony.
Hey Kipkat07
wait, how can derpy only have 1 3/4 of water in a town with running water ?
6_9
She didn't pay the water bill.
We just need to push harder with Clinton, right?
just woke up from a 6 hour nap. 830 PM naow
Because they were late on cleaning up winter so all the water was frozen.
that's a start :P
any way
back to my homework
If derpy derped three times, and then rainbow dash caused a sonic rainboom, how many windows would derpy have broken?
They need to show Fluttershy and RD.
rainbow broke the windows

that sucks why not sue him?
http://cdn.smosh.com/sites/default/files/bloguploads/what-i-do-meme-brony.jpg
Actually I was thinking more along the lines of sealing him in a crypt like in that Edgar Allen Poe story
a brony meme YES!!!!!!!
/me explodes
yep thats me
Yay~ Fluttershy
wait theres a Midnight_Fyre and a Midnight_Tempest!?!?!?!
What the stare lol
<_< >_>
bartsonic: is true
You have a serious spontaneous combustion problem, Midnight_Tempest. I'd see a doctor about it if I were you
Pegasister16 I am enjoying this
/me gets the dust pan and brush to clean up Midnight_Tempest's remains and puts them in a bucket
Thanks, Morty!
Fluttershy is op in FiM, killing you with one stare
doctors... BAH!
CountDoofus: steam crashed
I think i've to;d himthat before too
yeap
Midnight_Tempest: are you like a phoenix?
Dat Cask of Amontillado
i wish i was a phoenix
Pinkie is OP, breaking reality
he's too messy
Pegasister16: that was very good
Capn_fisty: should I try n come back? getting rather late here tbh
CCCP- Thanks!
:)
/me explodes again, into a neater pile
much better
And then Steam burnt into a leathery crispy smouldering mess.
I return.
CountDoofus: nah, no connection to steam and its late here too
MeanWHile, sorry bro my steam went ARRRRGGG and died
WE DID IT THOUGH!
WE ARE GODS
Jaketehsnake: I think that happened to everyone.
im dling a bunch of MLP skins for L4D2
Nearly dead gods.
Nearly dead gods but gods all the same
i am Kratos!!!!
I am Sparticus
11,01I keep forgetting to mod L4D2.
When steam comes back whos up for MOAR!?!?!
or Killing Floor
god is dead - nietzsche, nietzche is dead - God
think I'm gonna find me a MLP related spray for TF2 and L4D before heading in
11,01Steam's down?
steam is back up
I have some I just need to apply them
Nittany_Discord: it is if you've just finished Blood Harvest.
that brony meme is so going on my facebook btw
mfw Toei animated the ORIGINAL MLP series
Dang it, did I miss fluttershy?
We did blood harvest on Expert. We have become nearly dead gods
F**K i missed fluttershy!!!!!!!!!!
11,01I remember everyone played No Mercy a ton in the original L4D.
yes yes you did
i see... play blood harvest, on expert in the original L4D... you will die like pigs
Now I have to wait for the replay.
/me cries :'(
/me is sad. Pigs?
Bacon?
11,01On average, I play on advanced.
Midnight_Tempest: did it, got the achievement.
my favorite campaign in L4D was Dead Air. got a thing for planes
Meanwhile: what achievement
Midnight_Tempest: all campaigns on expert.
o.o dear god no...
all campaigns on expert can only be done with a well tuned group of 4 players
i have yet to find that group
i really like this pmv http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogkgF90X6Rw
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdZ1va0AQYc&feature=g-like&context=G2fb9c4dALT0PYiAACAA
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opU5L1tQ-tE&feature=relmfu
11,01You wouldn't want me. People tend to get in the way of my bullets.
Black hole muzzle
i shoot everything so dont worry
perhaps you shouldn't point the guns at the other players Nittany_Discord... its L4D2, not TF2
11,01I try not to, but people still get in the way.
then they need to crouch
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jajZ6CmOn28&feature=related
One does not simply crouch in L4D2.
11,01Have you seen me play on stream?
The real way to do things is to run like a looney and hope everyone else follows suit.
^
11,01Yeah...if you want to restart 50 times.
Left 4 Speed Run The Game
HEY
you guys could play Killing Floor
and incoming SaxyPretender

there was a time when the BBC accidntally showed porn
THAT REMINDS ME SaxyPretender, I saw some of the character skins for the P4 fighting game.
Midnight_Tempest: i thought the same thing!
Capn_fisty: seriously?!

Suda51 you crazy sonofabitch
Midnight_Tempest: the rpg?
otakon: so SaxyPretender being SaxyPretender. Anything else?

Cool.
0,14Dragon's Dogma looks like a bad Skyrim
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sPwM3guang
LC for the sole reason Tara Strong voices the main character. sounds like Twilight too
otakon: ive already played the P4 rpg... i want the fighting game now
0,14also, fighting games are kinda my thing =P
babababababababababa
Have you watched P4 Anime?
I haaaaave
SaxyPretender: no, it' looks like Skyrim and Dark Souls had a bastard love child. i.e. AWESOME
So awesome.
0,14the gameplay footage failed to impress me
0,14that's hard to do
/me wants noms
Kanji in drag. ALL MY YES.

Never played Dark Souls, heard it was meant to be hard.

LadyCanary: who are you babysitting?
/me starts humming "My Shiny Teeth and Me"
/me is asleep
My cousins.
babysitting, ugh, that's gotta be fun
i have tried hurting myself and thought of hurting others my life was a downward spiral and then i found mlp fim and i slowly am getting better i have more friends i feel accepted and am just really happy
Aged 12, 11, 6, and 3.

damn it ALL!
Yup. But theyre all asleep. ^o^
this pic can be used in so many places http://images.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/rsz/mlfw2830_small.jpg
otakon: it'll probably be in may if thats the case
lol, mission accomplished
bartsonic are you saying mlp is the cure foar emo
bartsonic: you sound like a socially superior version of me. It does get better, always remember that.
mlp & bronystate helped me convince myself I have friends
wow, bartsonic just made me really sad for a second there
And I shall be back!! Goin home~ errybody smile
<3
:)
i wasnt emo per say
Midnight_Tempest: I hope so, Mass Effect 3 will make me broke
._____.
i punched a wall soo much i left a crack and made my knuckles bleed
this community... I truly hope it lasts foreeeeveeeer
Depression and emo, not the same thing.
otakon: why broke? you pre-ordered it right?
mass effect 3 also gets sold via origin which is why i'll pirate it
ah depression, I do not miss you one bit
damn i suck so mucg at killing floor
much*
Midnight_Tempest: not Dragon's Dogma, just Mass Effect 3 and it's nto quite paid off as of yet
bartsonic "I have tried hurting myself" sounds pretty emo to me
IshBestPony: that's depression and is physchological problems, emo is a whinier version of goth.
/me looks at the knife cuts on his hands. o.o i hurt myself daily it seems...
Anyway, that was a nice story. Glad MLP was able to help you
i dated an emo... once I heard her ask me for a dog collar i was like o___o
lol
i guess mlp was a cure and thats good i feel better now i feel better not a loner i can get on here and talk to you guys and be well happy its good knowing that im liked
It is the part of me that reflects Pinkie Pie. I like to make people smile. Hard to do without friends.
Midnight, Unintentionally correct?
Kipkat07: was she hot?
0,14good to hear, bartsonic!
also!
LOL
i thought she was
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYZQIUwezg8
LISTEN TO THAT AND JAM!
so maybe in a way mlp could cure the world with this war and violence
Was she Abby from NCIS?
if only man if only
Hey guys
I suppose MLP has helped make me a bit less of the cynical bastard that I had become after spending years on a political messageboard that basically drains your soul from the stupidity and vitriol from both sides of the aisle
hello IngloriousPony89
^^^^
I wish I could say MLP cured me, but it's only served as a really big speed bump thus far.
Life story Fyre
heya IngloriousPony89 hwo ya doing today?
I think the only 'difference' MLP made in me is not being afraid to have interest in something that is shunned by the world.
Pretty good. Sick, but pretty good other than that.
Ok guys, food for 10 Minutes then some VIDEO GAMES
meanwhile i hope it can some day help you more not just be a speed bump
What VIDEO GAMES Jake?
I think one of the reasons I found the show so appealing was because it provided such a great alternative to that place
^
indeed
PROBABLY ZOMBIE VIDEOGAMES
Jaketehsnake: i'm soooo bad at KF i need to lear to aim with a mouse

Just watched the Discord (JdL) video on EqD. Couldn't stop laughing at his response to an MLP question
I'm a big guy, but I don't like starting fights

Good job standing up to that asshole mario
bartsonic - MLP doesn't remove our problems, but it gives us a good distraction from them
^
i almost got into a fight arranged by some other kids but teachers found out before it happened
Yes, like crack, only more addicting
Happines is distraction from life, Life is suffering
I share the same thoughts mmendo24
Kipkat07: like I said, don't give into those pricks!

MLD is good, but it just feels too contrived at time, which takes me out of the story
*times
Meanwhile: watch this and tell me if you feel anything: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muyj_spgCls
the start of MLD is my currrent life
One day I might read it, like how one day I may watch Casablanca
/me grabs some popcorn

i liked MLD cryed the first time but thats it it's a nice sad history
IshBestPony didn't read MLD
Nooooooo, not Seymour
people can be so evil picking on others today i saw people fighting one person i used to like also fighting and everybody just crowded around and did nothing while the one i used to like was horribly clawed in the face by a different person
Where do you live CCCP? Pretty terrible terrible place to be
flutter_spin: i watched Casablanca last week
Oh geez, that episode :(
I HAVE RETURNED! with homade cookies, juice and a snack pack pudding cup :D

CCCP: As said from some guy I dont know, people who dont miss the USSR are unpatriotic, but people who want it back are insane.
CCCP: oh yes, i was so great
hiya RAWRity
mario_pony: we get into heated debates over such innocuous topics as "Is mare-do-well a good episode?". We are not collectively intelligent and civil enough to actually cover anything from the real world.
Aircrafter: im insane
Now that I have fool in y belly, WHOS READY FOR SOME VIDEOER GAMES
CCCP: I expected much, lets be insane together 8D
Got an Xbox Jake?

Aircrafter: YAY! i dont suffer from insanity i enjoy every second of it
Glorious PC gaming master race.
I'm scared for my life every second I go walking late at night where I live.
i need a job so my family can get $$ but our state work age is 16

I'd assume you're under 16 Kipkat07?
pitched*
i am paranoid though
14
Kipkat07: why do you need money?
CCCP, you remind me exactly of a guy I know on another forum. Although I disagree with his politics, we like to talk about world affairs and our mutual desire to visit NK
speaking of Mare do well, anybody here seen Chad Rocco's review of that episode?
Someone asked Xyro about the economy and he politely responded "I cannot say anything about the economy because I have a full time job. I prefer not to comment"
Midnight_Fyre: is that a good thing?
A wee bit RAWRity. Just saw Mare do Well on the site and thought Id give it a go
Sure, he's one of the more level headed people on a forum full of a-holes, even if I don't agree with him often
Midnight_Fyre: lol
Kipkat07: why do you need money?
LadyCanary: he kinda tears into it.
...Ow.
and by kinda I mean really
Derpy T shirs XD
ouch

See, I can handle disagreiing with someone, but a bunch of people there are just proudly ignorant or downright vile. He's a nice guy though
nobody knows my dad, my mom is dead, my grandparents adopted me, my grandpa is dead, my grandma is retired & we get paid social security every month but by the 20th of the month we have les than 25$ to live on
im most awake when im tired
hey gus, http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/119506?search=tenacious_d how much is that in awesome dollars?

...Ouch.
0,14oh man, I'm so sorry to hear that, Kipkat07
Dark_horst, At least over 9000 maybe moar
Let's see. Cooler = 20%, does anyone know the percentage of "awesome"
it doesnt bother me as much as it should because im used to death in the family
Kipkat07: i never knew my dad either he left when i was born.
we need somebody in here who knows the rad/cool course
awesome is 60%
just keep your head up Kipkat07
Awesome is measured in fractions. It is approximately 1/5 more awesome than anything else
that reminds me, we never streamed the pick of destiny in here, did we?
im the last Koleff in my family that is a kid
Dont believe so Dark
we really hsould
Koleff is my surname
you guys do not understand, Jake needs Video Games, Somepony must Join him in his wqquest!
thats why im so proud of my family
I would love to move out of my house and live on my own, but the amount I make is less of the bills my mom gets for the house she got.
What're you doing Jaketehsnake?
Probable L4D, I'll take suggestions though, I have a lot
one day a kid made fun of my family and i almost broke his neck
O_o
yowch!
Probably should of if he was being that disrespectful
darkness
i bottle up my anger

i get so mad when i see someone with their dad and are happy i just wan't to hit them!
I'm more like fluttershy in that regard. I just break into tears.

but wait bronystate will still be up!
Anyway, isn't that the moral of My Little Dashie?
mmendo24: Ill wait about 2 months...becuz by then the creators will be so spammed by unhappy mail that theyll have to continue it :P
I mean like the last episode is aired and thats it:(

i can honestly say that i never EVER waited for a once a weak show to air the next EP like i do for MLP
"I've been closing my eyes to find...the old familiar failures."
NO mario_pony, lol
ive told all my freinds im a brony and they say im a fag:(
The kids at my school are pretty good. Granted if they knew I was a brony they'd tear me to shreds
Midnight Tempest, /) Kudos to you my friend. We need moar like you@
they dont know where the us is
Same, Dark_Horst
Moar friends.
Kipkat07 and mmendo24: f**k em up!!!!!!
NO
The kids at school Know I am a brony, some accept it, some say "GAYYYYY" some just fdont give an Eff. Like me!
^
Jaketehsnake: f**k em up!!!!
lol. I told people at work. They were surprised, made fun of me, then never heard about it the next day
Violence isnt the answer.
Love and peace!
^
Well I live in a school with 300 kids. EVERYONE would call me gay and I dont want to give them the opportunity to do that.
I agree
f**k em up!!
And friendship.
No. No no no mario_pony, that is no the answer! Just stop reacting to there insults!
At least one of my friends is starting to like it
My school is hilarious!!! Its a public school and the town is really small. There has never been a bully and there is basically no such thing as popularity, Cause every one is popluar in my school.
their*
i couldnt tell anyone at my school because they already hate me
Told all my friends, and they still mock me about it, but its a friendly thing not a bully way :P
One guy said "You tell me about new movies, video games, and tv shows that are good. You are never wrong. If you say it is good, it MUST be good"
My friends are mostly indifferent, one of them says its just because its mlp that people care, plenty other cartoons get a following
F**K EM UP!!!!
you show a bully something they're doing is bothering you, then they'll never stop
RaveBrony, that was how it was at fist but now everyone knows and it is old news
Like every single kid gets along no matter what they do
Mario_pony, no. Bad person. Do you need a timeout?
LOVE AND TOLERATE BULLIES
Illbe hyper one day and my friends will be like "Calm down, youre acting like that pink cocaine using pony' :D
Do you mean fuck them up with love and tolerance mario_pony?
30 kills BTB in halo to easy
my name is mario_pony not Mario_pony
Ravepony, the kids at my school refrence "the lesbian one"
LOL
DaringDude: NICE
>_>
lol
senior citizens are the only ones who understand my problems
IngloriousPony89: no i mean f**k em up!!!
Lol, oh geez :D
it'S weird that you can watch spongebob, no problem at all, but when it's about mlp everyone's suddenly like "what the fuck mate"?
I didnt actually expect anyone to be here
I was picked on bad in middle school, until I got popular. Then I somehow got on the "do not tease" list.
and we lost 76 to 100 lol
Dark_Horst: ikr?
lol
can't win em all
Question to everybody: Woould you ever consider getting a tattoo, and if so, what would it be?
13spongebob is not a property with a long history of being marketed to young girls
I bet if the show was called "Friendship is Magic" it wudnt look so bad to others :D
cutie mark
Maybe
/me had a Spongebob slumber party at age 10.
So what are we watching....
But add My LittlePony and God Forbid someone liking it! :D
other then nothing
Spongebob was good AT FIRST. Then it slowly went into a pit of horrible viewing entertainment
tattoo? you do that, i stay the hell away
/me had a spogebob slumberparty last week :3
RAWRity: i would write f**k em up on my arm
Rawr...Just about too try the ruse demo. Give me luck everypony.

IngloriousPony89: remember... f**k em up!!

^^^
draw me like the felt girls XD
id get a cutie mark and a usaf symbol
anypony up for reach or halo ce?
flutter_spin: well no, but i'll try it any way cant be too hard
There is a big difference between your average cosplayer and MLP Live
Get a cutie mark? as in a tattoo? O.o
Ill play reach
eeyup
http://img.ponibooru.org/images/61/6195b372203255711cf65f0bd76889a1
CCCP - if it's Spirit Week, then you obviously must go as Discord
the Spirit of Chaos and Disharmony
MLP live is a disgrave. Cosplayers do a much better job
mlp live? isn't that this braindamage on stage?
Roflmao at that pic!! :D

Kipkat07: ffffffffffffff.....

So, I've been trying for a few years now to figure out what I want for my first tattoo, and oddly enough, I think MLP may have indirectly helped me figure out what I want.
How many did they end up having during the Fighting is Magic stream?
I'm 19, jobless.

Kipkat07: f**k em up

Dark_Horst I am still on chapter 31. I am "rationing" It persay XD I wasnt to enjoy it all! Is horizons any good? Should I read it?
frozen!
lol
I want to enjoy it*
met at far away place
lol i was thinking the same thing when i found out.
and keep it in your prayers/hopes/thoughts as I await the response from the EQD pre-readers.
horizons is the only spinoff that measures up to kkats original
I think Fighting is Magic is going going to turn out to be a big hit :3
Jaketehsnake: Horizons is pretty good, but it pulls even less punches at times. Chapter 8 got me in tears by the end of it
I still have to finish the original >..>
probably becasue kkat helped the writer a great deal, as it seems
going going :D

/me startles the witch
Nao we only need one moar! MahBoi777 Wheres the fun in that XD?
Placebo: Nuuuu :(
it's one of those fics that'll have you at the verge of tears at times
agreed
Pegasister24: i love that song!
/me lights the witch on fire
like I said, Chapter 8 got me
chat always freezes for me every once and a while
i want to read something that will make me cry for some reason:P
Dark_Horst: I couldn't get into that Project Horizons =/
mld
Jaketehsnake: LOL
gotta say, Rarity's stuff in Fighting Is Magic is looking pretty awesome.
Pegasister24: Sunset is a good choice
Dark_horst , I was violently Assulted with plot twists by FO: E . They were enjoyable plottwsists
Same here Pegasister. Dont know why.
Pegasister24: bubbles
Placebo why not?
RAWRity: Indeed
bubbles?
ugh, autotune :(
BUBBLES!!!!!!!!!
bubbles :(
Jaketehsnake: well you won't find too many in Horizon I don't think but it's a bit harsher
/me needs to read Bubbles now
Dammit sad Derpy fic! :(
I've found that sneaking up behind a witch with a baseball bat is a BAD IDEA
Dark_Horst: Only read the first 2 chapters, I think. Just wasn't getting in to it. Guess the whole "Hide the screwdriver up your anus" thing got me.
flutter_spin: TAKE THAT BACK! it's CHIP TUNE 8 BIT, NOT AUTOTUNE
Hell I may just do that right now
IngloriousPony89: Get a hankerchief
inb4 Bubbles becomes the new Fanfic that is purported to be super sad but isn't.
^
what is bubbles?
i...dont think he hid it in his anus
Pegasister24: it's a fanfic it is sad
my bubbles!
Bubbles is the new My Little Dashie
Yu[
yup*
I bet it's booooriiiiing.
And did My Little Dashie make you cry RAWRity?
Meanwhile: It is.
omg! i want to read it then!! My little dashy made me cry:'(
IngloriousPony89: not a tear.
after mld and the fanfic that cant be named i cant read sad or grimdark fanfics
RAWRity: Like a baws
I felt it was way too manipulative to find it sad.
My Little Dashie made me realise that my wall was really interesting.
Placebo: if you liked the original fallout you should give project horizons another try. it'll be worth your time
Nonono.. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BseyCNMQBc autotune
If u didn't cry while reading MLD u have no soul
/me didn't cry.
:o
My Little Dashie made me realize how my life isn't so pathetic :3
/me Placebo TO THE MOON
Placebo: I love you <3
It didn't feel like this was an organic story that was sad. It felt like the guy was just trying to hit ever "sad" trope and cliche he could fit into the story in order to try and tug heartstrings
TOY_PON3: wub wub wub
:3
whoa, we're dealing with a badass over here
We need a 4th For L4D2!
MLD made me stay home from school because I was covered in my own blood and tears
TOY_PON3: is it sad that my life is much like the main character of MLD?
Ummm...
o.o/
LOL
blood?
^
nosebleed
CCCP: Yeah a little
blood? Dafaqu?
Pegasister24: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RgkrBTryVCfmAARA5ZCMTY4nTa2ta2-mhmdpxvipEoA/edit?hl=en&pli=1

>Must be included in Dashie conversations.
Lol
these constant cliffhangers are chasing me up the wall
It was sad, and the Phil Collin's tribute to it made me hnnng
brb, everypo9ny, restarting my comp :\
But.. I ddin't cry.
I shed a tear or two while reading MLD but I wasn't crying like a baby
My chat client just went BOOM so did anybody mention me>?
anyone read bittersweet?
Placebo: i started crying after i finished the first page
TOy_PON3 thats how I was
And that's why Jaketehsnake Is best pony.
i was crying like a baby
Jaketehsnake: Nice
Placebo, REPEAT

Ok. I'm off to read Bubbles. Wish meh luck!

MahBoi777: Holy shit really?

Placebo: For what? Tracings? Oh no I havent traced them on the comp

My free hand fluttershy doesnt look so bad since I had a reference picture...
Aircrafter: ooo i thought he was pressuring you to........never mind
10,02He always wrote letters to Princess Celestia dictating Twilight's feelings and thoughts to her, but he never really said his feelings to her in his own way. So to rectify that he climbed the mountain where he last remembered the one thing that truly connecter their feelings together. With that hope, he felt sending a letter to the star above might somehow allow his letter to reach
10,2Twilight, in the hopes that he too might hear her thoughts once again ;____;

WHERE DID ALL THEB GUITARS COME FROM??
What the hell.
^^
How did they pay for all this.
imposible song on expert
Magic.
Dark_Horst Pinkie Pie
It was their Superbowl stunt
I highly doubt they were short on funds for this.
i'll settle for that explanation
Yeah, isn't this a Ford commercial?
Wut.
Chevy
This is an advert?
buck that ending up a bit
0,14DOOOOOOOOOOOOODGE makes better commercials XD
did we get it
08,01that's so cool
OU
ah this one
:)
Dodge needs to higher Piccolo, stat.
08,01um
No. I don't think they officially made a commercial for it. There was just a notation at the bottom of the Superbowl for "click here for video"
I have never seen an advert that long... O_o
08,01what
well i have to shower and go to bed good night everypony!
Hire*
WHY is this one so much better?

it sound japaneese
good night!!!
Night mario_pony.

Japanese: Ok; Russian: Ok; Italian: WE CAN DO BETTER
wait anime!?
is this really the Italine intro?
0,14yep
YES
apparently
well, it DOES sound a bit similar to japanese... but it's clearly not
bye!
Italy did a different introduction
This is the extended version
0,14...I am now imagining Ezio watching this intro
Dark_Horst: your kidding right?
..
It's so long... _>_<
Hmm. I would've thought Italian ponies would have more body hair...
0,14I don't know WHY
Whoa what is this?
otakon: How many times have you accused of trolling tonight? lol
0,14but I am
nope
SaxyPretender he'd love it.
Too much SCV SaxyPretender.
SuperBrony64: WE NEED THE FAUX ANIME OPENING PLEASE!
Italy version introduction
i'm talking about the beginning
Placebo: I'd say twice now.
first 10 seconds
Yeah, I prefer our intro, if nothing else, it's brief.
vola e vai!
this is cool. its like the music in the sims. its good but you cant understand it
someonen who doesn't know italian could mistake it for japanese at first
CMC with flippers, FORESHADOWING
Everyone did the same introduction as US except Italian just went "We can do better"
I can't imagine having to sit through this. every saturday.
08,01wow, this goes on for freakin' ages
Yeah, that was pretty long.
Dark_Horst: not a chance in hell
uh oh
?
So the lyrics are different then?
0,14oooh, francais
Dah! French!
well, if you think so
0,14they speaking fancy

O_o
Wait, which one is it that a male sings Pinkie Pie? Russian?
Toot sweet!
Ohmai
mfw recoloring one of the Mane 6 = making an OC...
08,01so this is waht pony sounds like *sunglasses* in Fance.
08,01YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAH
lolololol
/me shoots self after seeing this
0,14XD
for some reason, the french accent makes that costume look so much more wrong.
I hope this isn't the official one.
French Pinkie's voice is cute
I wonder what the Apple Bloom speaking fancy scene was in French..
flutter_spin you're kidding, right?
08,01the lass singing this has a *horrible* voice
come on pinkie dance the CAN CAN
the voice fits pinkie like a rock fits a fusion reactor but hey, at least it sounded nice
0,14ooh this!
And YESSSS
It's horrifying
lol
Wait.
Placebo: I've been wondering the same thing
wait
wat?
:(
I'm not sure. I remember seeing a video where some man sings Pinkie Pie
Ah this song <3 <3

You haven't heard Ponies until you experience it in the original Klingon.

For some reason, I always imagined Green Arrow and Black Canary singing this.
08,01high and mighty, but actually useless

RD is the winner by default
the 'sweeter' part gets me everytime
08,01yup, definitely, my ex.

I can't remember her name!
it WAS here

and where'd that song come from?
0,14this is soothing
Dark_Horst: it was from Annie Get Your Gun
/me is feeling suddenly sleepy.

DARKWING BUCK!!!!!!
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Once again, I wish it were true :(
mhmmm
PLOT
i know TOY_PON3 i know...
What was the point of building a road downhill going to the edge of a cliff?
When there's trouble you call DW
if only there were sentient equines....
logic
This abomination would live only 3 days in total agony but its screams sound like fluttershy squee ? sold !
why are we watching the worst episode ever?
dat box cutie mark
Bronyzilla: FOR SCIENCE
Pinkie sense activate
I see now.
and thats how you play jenga~
It all makes sense..
mhmm
not very well built
I lost!
Im guessing Pinkie is Mare Do Well
She isn't
anyways brb shower
ponies have no german engineers
just a hunch
Placebo: Come along now
Stallion is riding Rainbow_Dash.
they probably hired mexicans
TOY_PON3: Oh my o//o

never thought of that Placebo
CrazyBronyDonut: to power the arcade games!
dat magic
yes this episosde is one of the worst
10,02Nah, nvm >_<
It's not that bad, but it was poorly written
and this is when i was thinking omg trixie
now, electricity is canon....
lol MahBoi77
Assuming the Oven's don't use natural gas, they must be electric.
:3
Okay so are you telling me after SuperBrony64|TACOS trolled us for a prize, which was this he trolled us again? :O
until this part
It must be...Twilight!
EEyup. Isn't he a silly filly?
This was the only flaw in their effort to teach Dash a lesson
this is a trrolling I'm okay with
10,02TOY_PON3: O___o
Why would you assume that, CupcakeWarrior?
It's Derpy
Petroleum is also canon. They have plastic and rubber products.
10,02he's on to me...
Which mean they probably drill for oil.
this gives it away so bad
/me is watching post Februrary earthquake footage. Which for his city was the WORST POSSIBLE THING
Just guessing
/me looks around and squees
Oooooobviooouss!
france, italy, petrol, elctricity, war...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inKCH26e-LU
I got the gist of it on the first view
10,02Jigsaw: "You bronies have long enjoyed your show without a care in the world or thought about the true meaning of friendship. Before you lies a stream that is connected through a series of wires attached to your body. It will detect a release of adrenaline caused by the adorableness of the ponies before you. Everytime you DAAW, will inject a poison into your veins that will turn you
10,2into what you desire most, a pony. Can you depress your deepest emotions to save yourself? Live or Pony, make your choice."
/me didn't think inception was that hard to understand

Im enjoying cleaning budgie s*** off my computer table
PS Vita has. . . no games.
10,02The Vita? D:
the what now?
10,02RawketLawnchair: Are you loco in the cocoa?
Vita has minecraft
that's all I need.
10,02Do you KNOW what games are out for it already
It has more games then the 3DS did at launch.
10,02Uncharted, Mod Nation, Lumines, BlazBlue, Ultimate MvC3, MotorStorm, etc.
3DS still has a kingdom hearts coming out.
iaintevenmad.
needs more ponies
that gravity game looks good
10,02When I get the Vita
10,02This is going to be my background
lol
nice
yeah thats totaly YOU
10,02You'll know it's me when you see it :3
I was worried he was gonna put lalalalala on then
10,02Does that handheld look AWESOME or what?!
such a pretty oled screen
10,02So much better than the PSP
want....but dont need, so it can wait
10,02I tried one out at Gamestop and that rear touchpanel is awesome :O
its going like BLA BLA BLA in my ears
GPS?
oh my..
10,02Yup
/me ponders if I can watch bronystate from a vita
10,02Probably
10,02If it supports Flash
hmmmm, may warrant a purchase now
10,02Which most likely it does
$100 for a 32gig?
that is the only bad part about it is the memory
to hell with that
I can get 60 gigs for $100
10,02That's for the memory card, yes
10,02You don't need that much storage really
a little over priced for a memory stick honestly..
I AM TOM THE ROCK!
well if you're a download junkie
10,02Well, it's proprietary
RARITY LOVES ME
10,02REally? :D
I'd get this for minecraft though.
thats it, its to do with their anti piracy or something like that
But can it blend?
Rock, the rock, can't stop the rock.

wipeout is best pony
Rollcage is better
I'm definitely getting one..
I need to rebuild my handhelds collection
hmmmm, better not sure. close call
rollcage is damn awesome though
I'm sure the'll come out with analog stick mods.
like they have for the consoles
get to 700 and you can't do s*it
10,02Is he selling me something now? O___O
So SuperBrony64: Wifi or 3G?
which one.
10,023G :D
10,02Because I don't want to regret it later on down the road O___O
Well if it goes through AT&T it'll cost extra for 3G service I would assume.
Bai guys, back to work. Have fun here.
Wifi for me
cya scavender
cause there is no 3g where I live
bye Scavender
oh god WHY
;A;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIuotFZnBtk
:'(
lol
10,02But yeah, it costs money for 3G
10,02The games don't come with instruction manuals ;___;
If the Vita allows me to download Kingdom Hearts 1 & 2 on their market place.
instant buy for me.
digital manuals suck
10,02Yup
10,02OH GOD
10,02I hate seeing the video of the press kits
10,02They get so much shit for free to review
for handheld those graphics are awesome.
10,02IKR
WHAT THE HELL
so much stuff!
<-- lived in new york his entire life
<-- never went to the big city
10,02It's a press kit
10,02It's what they give special people to review their stuff
and they keep it?
i wanna be special
10,02Yup
.____.
going to throw some mud of me :D
10,02Some of the more expensive stuff like Apple, they have to send back I believe
10,02But this, they usually let you keep I think
No comprimises? so that means no hacked systems?
makes sense
10,02I need to get it tomorrow now O___O
10,02But I shouldn't get it ;____;
10,02School is hard enough this semester

cya paradise92
DAMN YOU NINTENDO

SuperBrony64: you agree with me that aside from SM64 that Super Mario Sunshine was best mario :3?
wombo combo!
i freaking love mario party
10,02Super Mario Galaxy was best mario :3
10,02Also Super Mario 3D Land :3
...
Mario Party: The game that tests friendships.
My list goes: #1: SM64 #2: Sunshine #3 MG 1&2
10,02But I loved all the Super Mario games ^_^

lol
epic animations
that was well done
dem dubstep zombies
what?
Applejack theme is best theme
TROLOLOL
^
oh god Iremember that
i want them to finish that game so much
applejack theme from fighting is magic is good
Twilight and applejack themes are best for this game
IMO
I can't wait for this game <3
I want to fight you all with friendship <3
Twi is op
I will destroy you using friendship!
Rarity is going to be OP.
Because bias.
i will hug you all to death
and it's just not because I'm epic tier at Marvle vs. capcom.
:3
I want to know who the other 11 are going to be
!!
I am faintly reminded of Touhou.
SuperBrony64! LET'S PITCH THIS IDEA TO NINTENDO.
Make our 3DS's compatable with wireless connection to our computers.
Also, AppleJapplejapple has a skin that is Big Mac colors
It's real neato.
and use them for vidya games. :3
aka
Fighting is magic
Fightan games.
also, Applejack theme next <3
celestia, luna, nightmare moon, discord, lyra, octavia, vinyl, bon-bon, berry punch, spike, trixie, big mac SHOULD be the other 11 in my opinion
pweaseeee
no Derpy
NMM is going to be a Super moveo f Luna
eh, i don't like derpy tbh :x
Because luna is nightmare moon
You fruitbaskets
:O

The Doctor Hooves one is epic
fluttershy is the only one who's concept art is like the real one
besides applejack
wow, Lauren Faust was right all the time. Hasbro, y u no listen sooner?!
say what?
ofna01: Pinkie Pie looks so different
yeah
weird,she sorta had a derpy coloring,except white,not grey
I think I'll be wearing that Brony shirt the most. so simple yet so awesome
am i the only one who noticed it?
I think that they actually look like the current characters with different color shcemes
laurens concept art hasnt changed from todays except colors
CCCP look at pinkie in laurens concept
So Pinkie pie was inspired by a pony named Suprise???
notice anything thats similar to derpy?
ya a bit but shes not grey
take the strings off the balloons,change the color slightly,derp the eyes,BOOm,its derpy
I wonder who made derpy
derpy was on the first episode but by an error or a DERP
yeah
she had those derpy eyes
and look what happened
she is now popular
she was just meant to be a regualr backround pony,but the eyes got derped,and,you know the rest
Still who ever made her deserves a medal
everyone
EVERYONE HERE DESERVES A MEDAAAAL
ohai StickySyrup
hello everyone

I am willing to pay £50 for a tee shirt
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEqwax4O9fU&feature=related
how much would that translate to in dollars sticky?
50 Euros = 66.15500 U.S. dollars
wow
Those are pounds, not euros
derped
yep
around $70-75
O___O
50 British pounds = 78.38 U.S. dollars
