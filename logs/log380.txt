Excus, someone can tell me why i cant see the stream?

Please wait whilst we deal with technical difficulties?
Saturn: LOLOL...which one... there are 3
Steven_Magnets, how do they work?

aah LDAP
Saturn: figuring out the force upon a current, the direction of the field due to a current, and the direction of flux upon a solenoid
has issues with acronyms
08,01this is for conventional current
Saturn: current through a magnetic field*
08,01aye
08,01jerk off rule.
/me prepares his throat for yelling....
Saturn: there are THREE jerk off rules I've leraned

hi guys :)
08,01Paradise92: yes, he is my lover from another... timeline?
Saturn you know Dr.Hooves?
:P
Saturn: no...flux is field lines / meter squared
08,01or rather, the cahnge in flux
(she was a serbian girl)
08,01emangamer|physics: i think you're confusing flux and flux density
Saturn: hmm...IDK all I know is telsa times amps times meter is a newton
08,01emangamer|physics: yup
whats everypony up to ? 6u8
08,01which makes it flux density

Saturn can i post a link for Mane6 stream?
08,01maybe we do it different to you in scotland...
08,01seeing as we're such a powerhouse of innovation
Estimates of the US invading Japan was as high as 500,000 US soldiers. Jpanese would have been even higher.

*doesn't own a console* (unless you count a Commondore Vic20)
It supports a bunch of different controllers.
really?
they plug into PCs?
You can also use the xbox 360 wireless controller if you buy the adapter
aah
didn't know that
=D
Because I already have wireless controllers and not the wired ones?
I guess I can steal an old wired controller from my nephews
Just performance wise
Its fine. The main issue is if the software you want is available on it.
there are lighter distros
oh
and downloads or such
wait
damn it
Can I just run ubuntu off the disk?
Yup
not unless you ask it to install

Ya'll get over here.
pull plug out of wall?
Soon
Wait
Is PonyKart a real thing?
Yes
At least as far as I know it is.
OH F*yay* YES
It could be an elaborate prank.
There's development ongoing as far as I've seen - no reason to think it's not going through
People have worked harder than that on pranks before
and they'd make a ton from it
just saying
pull prank or get rich
They're not charging for ponykart
but they're still raking it in
there is always a way to make money
lol
yup
but i only had it for 2 months

hmmmm, may warrant a purchase now
10,02Which most likely it does
$100 for a 32gig?
that is the only bad part about it is the memory
I can get 60 gigs for $100
10,02That's for the memory card, yes
10,02You don't need that much storage really
a little over priced for a memory stick honestly..
10,02Well, it's proprietary
