9we're going to LIMBO
11LEVEL 4 LIVESx01
lol
I have a level 85 warrior
how stable is this level?
I have the movie, but I like the socal interaction
PLANET OF THE APES
level 4 aint shit
This movie now takes place on a beach inside of an army base inside of a hotel inside of a van inside of a plane.
we'll they have been changing with each level.
And she's holding Fischer hostage in Limbo
THE TIME OF RETRIBUTION HAS COME
Mal, that is
ROUND 1
we must be done
very unstable
YOU BLEW IT ALL UP!
And in this Limbo, is this Mal's limbo?
9e'yup
Shoddy architecture right there
it has been hundreds of years since they built limbo
OOOHHH
and that's why everything is falling to pieces?
Where are the cheat codes when you need them?
"I woke up on the shore of my own subconscious."
The apocalypse level
9no, Limbo is a shared state of all of their minds
AND THE VAN IS STIL LFALLING.
you know
* STILL FALLING
It's the island from Kingdom Hearts.
Suddenly: Farlanders, thousands of them.
I just realized there's still static
9so it also includes Cobb's
So...How much time do we got in level 4?
9and by extention, Mal's
>a literal shore
It's still alfalfing
SPAAAACE
LISTEN TO THE STATIC
MWAHAHAHAHA
YOU DID IT! YOU BLEW IT UP!
9because they've already been in Limbo and they share the same dream
But it appears to be based off of Cobb's and Mal's dream
That's it.
But gravitation potions only last two minutes
pew pew pew
spave? spave!?! SPAAAAVE!
*yawns* not because of the movie
themarewhoarrangestheblocks NNNOOOOOO
DAMN YOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!
11THEMAREWHOARRANGESTHEBLOCKS: NO YOU DON'T!

9because Cobb and Mal have been to Limbo
Ha Irony!
team fortress inception by valve
That's why you just keep drinking them, UncleOrange.
nade in hand
11I heard he's REEEEAAAALLY messed up in the head.
well theres no way this could possibly fail
OMG! I was wrong. It was Earth all along.
Gods help you when you run out.
DAMN YOU ALL TO HEEEEEELLLL!!!!
FUUUUUUU
themarewhoarrangestheblocks: for curiosity or to invade?
9they built a world in Limbo
GAWD
8theyre the only ones that have been there
Wow those guys are bad shots

Brokeback Inception
THe future!
8everything in limbo was built by them while they were there

0Level 5
Equestria = Lvl 5?
but i have morbid curisody.
0Equestria
Limbo, level n+1
The part about dreaming lightly, I mean.
8Silverscreen: wat
9since Cobb has been there, this Limbo is a projection of Cobb's
simple physics
-just came in- whats playin folks?
I like to be fully in control of my dreams
0thats quite interesting
n=constructed dreamspaces
for the scenes in the hotel
level 4.5
when i close my eyes i somtimes see blocks
are we looking into the future?
11It was very odd.
Nothing comes after Equestria!
DEFEAT THE ARMY OF MANTIS MEN
You should write a fic
what's on
Well then how come Twilight has a dream?
8because cobb hasn't been there in centuries of limbo time
Dream preview of Season 2.
is this Inceptionor that Tomatoes movie?
Can they shape limbo since there aren't prjections
This is Inception
not terribly, CircuitMane
techdude3000 yup
9pretty much
Because an army of the latter would be pretty cool.
CQC
one time i had a dream i was playing world of warcraft and then we came to a boss and the only way to beat him was to have sex
screw the real world
/me used to dream within his dreams all the time when he was little
COMMANDO

Dem stormtroopers.
9bloody good movie eh? That's why my expectation of Rises are good

Killtastic!!!
I fucking never remember my dreams
You see, when Celestia banned Luna, she really just sent her sister deeper.
It's certainly entertaining
gggala: Oh okay, maybe it's my crazy pony mind
silverscren: I never get rarity in mine D:
/me woke up from a dream within a dream. Realized he was trapped in the level 1, panicked
somewhere
they need more c4
lol
9the only pony-related dreams I've had are pony-merchandise-related
I had a dream once where I flew with rainbow dash, then got friendly air tackled by her
i only remember the incredibly epic images
It was nice.
C4 up in this bitch.
DO IT WITH MAGIC
I've had pony dreams before
/me 8had a dream once where he was defending Equestria from 4chan trolls
With self-inserts
I had a Derpy dream.
Samus just took her clothes off.
Did you die?
inb4 last-minute exposition
That's Wario, Snake.
11Hipster_Brony: was that Equestria or Ponychan? :P
the horror!!!!
something you should know about inception- they really only use heroin
Hipster_Brony: Pics or it didn't happen
8it was equestria
I had a dream where Twilight was supplying a castle seige
My best dream was defending Japan from North Koreans and CHinese
shoot her!
hipster_brony: Please tell me you had a grenade launcher or something that went boom
0man
the horror!!!!
has anyone else ever noticed that Cobb says "There's only one thing you need to know about me" like, five times in this movie?
Hi Mal...
I never dream
i had a dream that i was vigorously masturbating then when i woke up i was vigorously masturbating
I found that I have nightmares consistently if I fall asleep to classical music.
8CircuitMane: i was the sniper from TF2
