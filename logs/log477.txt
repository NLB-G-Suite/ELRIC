I was hoping for Arkham City
11,02I'll play some of this and then some of MW3 :)
03he goes around snapping 27 pictures of everything
02lmao
031080p, 30 frames per second, done
03I mean, his camera isn't even that great, it's like 4-5 megapixels?
031080p is 2MP
03so yeah
i can only do a success on the first level i suck at the other levels!XD
Isn;t Rayman still a failed franchise?
nonono
Rayman used to be my favorite! :)
lol a song
Lorem Ipsum is standard filler text
02I hate it when some people take 100+ pictures of everything thinking they're a pro
I still vote for Arkham City instead
Raymon?
02XD
03but does it actually *mean* anythign?
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:5aeR1wqNZr0J:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=nz

I'm bored."Hug attacks Irish_Pony"
03I don't make them stay posed for 5 minutes while I focus my camera
02XD
03so he has to manually focus it
02I can focus my camera in just a few secs
fail
03one benefit to point and shoot is you don't have to deal with that
03I can just take like 4-5 pictures and be done
epic song for the dieing lol
Considering he;s playing live for a lartge audience he sin't doing bad
03http://chzfailnation.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/epic-fail-knowing-your-fruits-fail.jpg
02dSLRs have awesome auto focus
03do they?
02yep
03maybe he's just dumb
03he strikes me as a wannabe pro photographer
03XD
;lol
Dem hip thrusts
some of the time autofocus is fine
02I only focus manually if I have all the time in the world to take my picture
03like he buys this Nikon DSLR because it works "better" than his point and shoot
depend how good AF is
03that being said
then he dose his hump dance!XD
03is Olympus
but if you want to achieve specific FX, then go manual
03those cameras are absolutely awful
my fav song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qgmxPb-ego
03they take like 10 seconds to snap a photo
LOL
The quality seems lower than usual...

First boss stage!
