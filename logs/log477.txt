Zecora's got sick rhyming skillz
zecora
owlicious: zebras are closely related to horses...
Sad things are depressed about just how sad that is.
owlicious : beacuse its magic i aint to explain crap
of course applebloom's worried about a cutie mark; sweetie may learn magic one day and scoot may one day actually fly. But applebloom's an earth pony
If it wasn't illegal I'd have made that coloured

I won't even look at mane chat
Let me guess:

The topic begins with v
Hearts Desire Flower eh? *Looks at GilDash with an evil smile*
owlicious: lolwut
GilDash: Meh, not all that worried.
AND THE LITTLE JIMMY'S KNOW IT
and ends with "iagra"?
Nobody commented on Zecora's Cheetah-skin bedspread?
And this is how Applebloom's addiction started...
Irish_Pony: Like you need that. :D
owlicious: You had me going for a second.
Evil face
*evil smile*
MLP = medical legal partnership
i live in aroura,colorado :( strong winds and lightning
was that... a leopard skin blanket on zecora's bed?
But I forget the spelling
It's the stream buffering so often for anyone else too?
Like a Boss
amazing
/me sits on Om's back and plays with his ears.

yep Malavolent
What a misconception, GilDash, I hear they were able to open up that portal to the 2nd Dimension, and now they reside there.
Malavolent : it is for me
Magic.

"You ain't seen nothin' ye-BUUFFFERRRR!"
Okay. That link's easy to take out of context. Medical Learning Partnership, not My Little Pony. And it was posted before season 1 premiered

actually I don't see much talk about viagra on the mane
you know
pikorar: My, you really are into the conspiracy theories, aren'y you. The last known record of a stabilied portal to the 2nd dimension was over 1000 years ago, when the Ooorgbla from Ziggagaga tried their escapades of forced firebreathing upon all known species.
Screw curriculum! Let the student become the teacher!
cherilee from the 80's should be able to hula hoop :)
So much Dinky.

Magical_pablez94: bet 50 bits Bronysith is having his way with her right now :P
That's where you are wrong GilDash, it looks like a circle, but only due to the gravity fields around it warping the view of the surrounding space into a two dimensional plane, but the planet really resided in 3 dimensional space. And I have been snacking on blue fungi, but that's none of your concern.
time for me to go goodnight bronies

Sylandest: Thank you. :)
Vraiment? il est francais dans cette filme?
DocSane: Indeed
Sylandest, and you believe I'm a kenyan prince with a frozen bank account.
Meanwhile: That's just mean. :D

Sylandest: Just not very sturdy ones

GilDash: Mean but accurate.

Fun Fact: Big bald bad guy is Heavy Weapons Guy's cousin - Jeremy

/me hooves wrag Sylandest "It gets hot in there so just use this ;) "
how do they keep missing this guy
did the lottery happen already?
You see, the key is to aim where he's going, not where he already is.
GilDash|Relocating: I've only heard them tonight. Perk of being in the countryside I guess. :3
Kencolt: we are aiming at him. But he moves out of the way
BLEEAAAAUUUUGH
BLAAAAAAAGH

BLAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagrrrhH!
BLAIFFQUFWUH!
trolololoo lololo loloo
it's a trap !

GilDash|Relocating: Everyone should have a garden.
The Silver Star? THATS IT?!
DuskStarshimmer: but the heroes steal some of their guns and they CAN use them

GilDash: Buissy right now

SuperBrony64: moo is that?
11,01I like planes.
If it's 1987 in this film, does that mean he's been after him for 12 years?
Nittany_Discord: :O
I like trains.
I remember when I got my first HD PC monitor in 2007/2008
*gets hit by train*
I see what's happening here

/me sighs
monitors are great though
last forever
Samurott
SuperBrony64: 6_9 wait, what?
GilDash: I don't even know what that means
I think they ran out of budget for the battlefield stuff and just said "Screw it, now we're in present day Manilla."
SuperBrony64: what would you do if a kangaroo attacked you?
Obviously? :|
Yup
/me feels like barking just for no reason
W-Wasn't this movie about Strike Commando?
bloody time travelling actors

owlicious|YAYNESS: what? XD
$5 on Scootaloo
Om: Whoops! :$
That cock needs more focus in his focus
Violent Cock porn
To me? Boring, really.
I think this whole movie was just an excuse for a bunch of guys to visit exotic places and... indulge in certain activities. If you know what I mean.
GilDash: Oh no.
Biglaw: hey, you have 2 hidden comments on your account...
Alchemist: No please, elaborate...
what was it? :3
RainbowAsh: Nobody cared at the time when this film was cared
On the other hand, this is Marcos's Phillipines, so anything goes.
why can't this movie end
03LOL
...Aaand animal rights kill themselves
Yeah, that Touchsmart was $920 while a 21-inch iMac is a bit over $1000
FlareChaser why yes, yes I do
/me keeps drawing
Om: I didn't mean to do that. :S
:(
03and iMacs aren't touch screen
WE DOn"T CARE, MOVIE
He's the Jarate Master:O
03that being said touch screen is really overrated in a desktop
Tbh, I've kinda been turned off to iMac more recently

/me 11,01is getting buffering
bomb in ashtray
ITS A TARP
nope, just reverted back to PC as I've been used to for all my life
Oh, Okay
A bomb..... he is now a terrorist
All of a sudden, it's buffering
PONY: I think they still filmed in black and white when animal protection became industry standard. At least the footage from that poor horse they dropped off a 50 foot cliff is in black and white, and that triggered the whole protection thing.
oh just my bass canon !!!!!!
Why is it buffering?
WYUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUB
DocSane: you too ? i'm not alone anymore
everyday im buffering
At least my two year old PC has good performance :|
actually more than 2 min., because of buffer
Meanwhile: want to be a part of the fukireta parade? it will be fun
RainbowAsh what
/me shuffle
Om: Really, I'm sure I can clean it up for you...
Trust me, I still think Macs are beautifully designed computers, and I don't think the OS is bad, but value for money is definitely out
/me 11,01dusts Twilight_Sparkle^_^
sorta
/me licks Om's artwork.
;D
Bronysith: EH?
RainbowAsh: the cock fight with no blood didn't get any attention though, I think
DAt buffering E:
There does seem to be rather a lot of buffering going on.
I fixed it with a refresh
They still run under him!/
Needs more buffering
I don't usually buffer. But when I do, it's not on my end.
03well
buffering buffering buffering
GilDash: Its hardly art. Just OC scetchs
Why not just make it at least a year or two after it?!
refresh it
sudden m60
03Liking OSX or not is a different story
Queen cheese-legs lol
Instead of 12 years!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hit the refresh button under the video window
03but I'm talking about people who buy the hardware just to get it
The MacBook I'm using now is having a hard time importing the several thousand photos on my iPod lol
AND THATS THE VIETCON COMMANDO!?
Om: I'm not on there, I hope? ;)
inb4 dakkadakkadakkadakka
03you can install OSX on anything LOL
We need stuff like this in the furry fandom... Really
Don't forget how expensive repairing Macs are when something acts up
Baws.
XD
03I have it working on my laptop just to prove a point
I liek dem 10 minute grenades
haha
LOL
there comes the ironman
Oh sheesh
YES!
rofl
awww
Oh, keep playing tat :p
03in fact
Wait? What?
Watch as our hero kills everyone that is using self defense
03there's a site called osx86.net
/me klooks for Tony Stark
i am irorn ma like a super hero in a garbage can
03that gives you an ideal desktop build
03for like half the price as a Mac Pro
03that's more or less the same hardware, if not better
Guns are totally SFW.
GilDash: Nope.
Naetaru: if glomping ever gets us as bad a name as something in furry fandom, we're doomed
Suddenly it's the first terminator all over again :p
World's most heavily armed import-export firm.
whatch as everyone that need to be killed gets a gun, so they can be counted as enemies.
alexxm, the nostalgia chick talked about it in her Milo and Otis review. I wouldn't recommend watching that one if you have a squeazy stomach, though, because that is another movie that didn't take animal protection seriously at all.
Shame the site doesn't have OSX torrents
/me flee
03you want onea?
03-a
03I actually have the Snow Leopard and Lion installers
Didn't he have some objection about killing in cold blood before?

PONY: Obama approves
owlicious|YAYNESS: The only "conncetion" I see i s that many furries are also bronies :P

YOU SUNUVABISJ!
Not worth it though
What I'd like is Mac design with better internal hardware and Win 7
Please stop inserting music into the movie.
He's been stweing for 12 yeard.
OHH YEAH :D
So boss..

Om: Aww. I was secretly hoping you might. :D
Yep

So many Phillipinos getting killed
Hes like totally looking at them for like 2 secs before shotting them... xD
GilDash: I don't know what you look like

03that it doesn't matter
03:P

PONY: since there are no triggers on m320 launchers if you noticed :D

Kill the music, please
so it cannot be used for cooling
and
...
Uhm...

Okay
It'll heat the Mac faster
This movie is 20% defiled.

Ohkay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
o.o'
YUMMY GRENADE
it needs to be 25% less defiled

I'm scared...
Om: Neither do I. I've got ponies drawing what they think I look like so I might get an idea.
03why would you spell it aluminium
03o_O
11,01SuperBrony64: You're the streamer silly filly.
Generally, I notice that the aluminum areas are cooler than the plastic
DRF
where the fuck did he come from anyway
Silverscreen: lol really???
British!
03...
Duh
03it's an element
I've been waiting for this! "BWAAARGH"
And he fights the Big Russian guy to the death-- AGAIn.

Gernades solve all problems

TEAM ROCKET IS BLASTING OFF AGAIN!
How did he say that after a grenade exploded in his mouth?
How did he shout that?
how can one yell after head blown off?
drf, it's officially spelled aluminium as an element in England
03well
It may be cooler, but doesn't mean it is a good thing for the computer
did he just yell after he hadd blown up?
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
03being pronounced differently
I dont believe I just sat through this.
anyways
03is not the same as being spelled differenty
GilDash: Come back when you know and I might consider it.
03+l
1,11The music was timed well with the actions, and if it wasn't so loud, it would have fit in perfectly well with the stream.

That was a Metal Teeth Russian Moment
He must have curesd him in the after life
alexxm , that's your cue !
It's got plastic in certain areas and aluminum for most of the rest of the structure
... Wow. This movie.

ooh shiny
03that I want to hack

What're we watching?
Bronysith: are we supposed to create our own ponifications?
Damn, Rarity is totally violent in this episode
6_9
It's actually for 5.1.1
03there's a 5.1.1 now?
GilDash: I'm not hungry. And, as I said, I don't know what you look like.
Kandarihu: waht? no just tape yourself doing the dance
Om, Draw GilDash like one of your French girls
It seems like 5.1.1 is weaker than 5.1 LOL
Wait, actual pony episodes?
11,01Earth pony spell tried on a unicorn.
sound like she said i`ll go thirst
Magicks
03that's how technology is these days
There's semi-untethered for 5.1, fully untethered for 5.1.1
03Take what used to be good and ruin it

GilDash: Then I am already done.

Oblivious Fluttershy is oblivious.
GilDash: Trying to kill me like the rest of the world :)
wing boner!XD
DocSane: but unicorns also live on the ground. I'm pretty sure Earth Ponies are ponies who are attuned to the earth in ways that Pegasi and Unicorns aren't.
yay
lol
It's funny how I love Rarity in this episode when I'm watching it now, yet the first time I saw it I thought she was a real bitch.
I just heard... "Princess Molestie" Damn you, Airpuff...

Om: At least we have something in common then. :)
03"iPhone 3G" was the dumbest thing ever

Rarifly is a Pony/Flying/POison type, right?
dem wingboners
It's Twahlaht Spahkule's bahloon, yadda yadda yadda.
GilDash: Congragulations
Well, Rarity made some huge and horribly stupid mistakes. But she learned from them.
Airpuff: Yes. You've sent me THAT MANY LINKS
yes
Pale_Horse: you forgot psychic
rarity is best fake alicorn
Naetaru: ... ;)
That's why they called the first iPhone a 2G, because it only worked with Edge
when it showed their faces their wings go up
DUN DUN DUUNNNN
AKA 2G, right?
Airpuff: *grrrr* >:T
:P
earthpony down below died

Drilling on a cloud?
Oooh, isnt it in this episode where Rarity has an epic evil laugh?

GilDash: The text in the chat is just so convincing.

PONY: From the looks of the toy, it means looking like a dollar store threw up on her.
03I have to provide proof that I'm a 'professional'

other than that they are basically supposed to be living jet planes
I wonder what Derpy's attraction was here...

Even easier for you :P
panda: ooh you :P
i spot lyra
Ooooh yes, even her piruettes are gracefull!
03is it?
Airpuff: :D
come to think of it, Rainbow wouldn't be in so much trouble if she hadn't formed her act around a unreliable move like the rainboom
maybe
03I thought 4.3.5 was never hacked either
when ever you see lyra
SONIC RAINBOOOOOOOOOOOM
how come DocShane
*cue Guile's theme*
LETS START!
Inb4 Guile's Theme.
I think 4.3.5 was kinda hard to break
GilDash: that's right :P
03y eah, only tetherd.

whole society based on beauty
03*tethered
03I'll update it

Scorch!
I dunno, RD is a little too self-absorbed
You can't for now
03wait what
are we already at the rainboom? I must be way behind
"When this pony hits 88mph you gonna seen some serious shit"

Listening to "Good riddance: Time of your life" made this perfect :) I'm almost crying a bit

ohigoshohigoshohigoshohigoshohigoshohigosh
The thing about SSH logs, save those so that you can downgrade just in case you want to go back to 4
Clelstia had a lot of will to not send RD to the moon for when she assaulted her with a cloud
CrimsonPhoenix: the H should be a M right?
ahem, the idiots are here
03it's SHSH
I notice that most of the pegasi have their wings out by default.
03but yeah
Duck face
iFaith is the tool you'll ned for that
I know pegasus magic lets them walk on clouds. I can roll with that... but what keeps the clouds of Cloudsdale in the shape of a city without slowly breaking up and drifiting away in the wind? Unless there are "Pegasi sculptors" constantly reshaping it all the time. :/
oh
02!Shipping

Low level magic field over all the buildings in CLoudsdale

Pale_Horse: Who says their clouds have the same properites as ours?
Now play this exact same episode, but in french
You had it when?
"I am basically a God, and I think RD is the best flier in all of Equestria. My word is law, but she's still not a given member of the Wonderbolts."
Thanks for streaming SuperBrony64.
what for Gamer_Luna
SuperBrony64: wat
Touche.
11,02Going to put on some games now :3
or for some Brony Movie Afternoon
Just now and then went to 4.3.5? xD
Makes sense to me.
but the ep isn't over yet
Yay games :)
11,01My stream is super-behind.
Pale_Horse, the weather is controlled by pegasi. Wind is a part of weather.
"plans" if u know what i mean

RD still needs to mature a bit.
11,01I'm still watching the episode.
thanks SuperBrony64

11,01RD is flying off with the Wonderbolts.
Still shipped with Spitfire.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
whats it about Gamer_Luna
They're normal clouds. I think that the way the pegasi keep their wings out is how they can stand on clouds without falling through them.
!eonget
11,01Now it cut to credits.
02EW Vanillish

Nittany_Discord: well no that happened for m5 secs ago

play through them in order?
Spitfire: .. so.. much.. spitfire..
Ah, luna!
PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
Princess_Molestia: You havent awnsered me....
GilDash: oh and just one more thing: Rainbow Dash and Spitfire together in the "Sh Shipony" video is one of the cutest thing ever :D
SuperBrony64: I LOVE YOU!
So close to 100%
owlicious: I'm not really new, I just haven't been around much the last couple months
11,02o////o
Customization, software changes, adding free applications, etc.

Alchemist: Stop. Reminding. Me. :D
Princess_Molestia Sister,what are you doing here?
Guys, quiet. I have a message for SuperBrony64.
My countrys pride and joy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXySHddZNRk

03supposedly
11,02O.O

i gotta wait till july 6th to get this game -.-
SuperBrony64: I WANNA BE YOUR SPECIAL SOMEPONY!
XD
14Why would you want to do that, though?
thats when its released in EU
So, yes or no?
03because iOS is awful
13torchlight 2 needs to hurry up and release
/me hugs panda and Litwick :3
Princess_Molestia: Since when did I say that?!
02FTW Android
02that's why
/me runs
14I like Droid and everything, but they're really not that much better.
SuperBrony64: get plan 10 perfectly so you're done with this game
Yesterday
03yes they are LOL
IS FUNNY CUZ I'M A GUTY
11,01I haven't even played the first Torchlight.
*GUY
02oh they are
Litwick: so am I ^^ and so is SuperBrony64
03granted BlueFlare is probably the closest I've seen to an Android fanboy if that can actually exist
14Sorry, but I've had nothing but a bad experience with them so far.
/me hugs SuperBrony64 back
03I have other stuff too like HP TouchPad and so on
kekeke
11,02owlicious: You don't want me to play this game anymore? :<
11,01SB is one P away from total perfection.
03He bought an Android phone
03tha twas defective
PLay a remix level :D
Princess_Molestia: That was before I knew...your real talents....
03went "Man, Android doesn't work, I'm buying an iPhone"
Shizuka: i know what you mean ._.
hi guys
Oh?
14I would never buy an iPhone.
03I'm like seriously? Just for ONE bad experience? Nothing is perfect, defects happen
SuperBrony64: well, i've changed countries since you've started. it'
03THANK YOU
Sorry guys, chat derped.

03FInally someone with common sense
Final stage :O
Hey MyLittleDashie
03but how is an iPod Touch any different
you can't do it
*rubs gamer Luna's horn*
03it's just an iPhone without the phone.
/me 11,01doubles the SuperBrony64
Muffin0: whats the email?
You can do it SuperBronywubby
02true
Princess_Molestia: Ok im sorry! I really am sorry!
DONG DONG
best date ever
11,01Fart rocket.
2If it can phone people and text people, I don't care what type of phone it is
Princess_Molestia W-what are you doing,sis?
this game must be HARD
14I don't use my iPod touch to communicate with people. I use it for my own personal entertainment. I noticed that you're not a huge fan of the touchscreen, but I like the idea a lot.
I forgive you Irish
Man, I love rhythm games.
Jeff
jeff
Come on...
It looks freakin hard :O
03the thing I hate about iPod Touch/iPhone is that there's only one giant button
14I know, I've owned and played with quite a few Android items.
hey Princess_Molestia hows your day been
03Android at least gives you the menu/back buttons
06Ran4president
well
wait a minute, is this what that video of pinkie pie eating cupcakes in rythim is supposed to be about?
4?
065ever
power, home, V+ V-
how did I join during one of these again
14The back buttons are normally on the touchscreen.
2:D
Good i guess
Princess_Molestia: Then...can you help me? Im a bit lonley....
03Apple's logic is "Remove all buttons!"
03hence the Macbook Wheel
rarity ????
/me runs
This is just... So... Random as fuck...
Sure Irish
/me hugs Irish_Pony
11,01Almost.
02it really is
02XD
.... missed one?
14That's not true. They actually added buttons onto the iPod touch since its very first version.
Awwwwww.
LordDerpington: are those just videos or are they actually playable?
NOOOOOO
03I know
03but not nearly enough
11,01Aww.
Aw
DANG! SO CLOSE!! >_<
11,01At the lame game as well.
awww
2!pokemon
Ran, you are a Makuhita.

03Android has power button too, plus volume, as well as home/search/back/menu
2But Staraptor :<
03some of the newer ones got rid of the search button but that's useless anyway
What Game is this?Looks fun :)
SuperBrony64: DISTRACTION
True
This game... I must play... While drunk...
Gnight everypony
bye Michael
darn, I would love to play that
Naetaru: been there, done that.
FlareChaser: And how'd that go? xP
You okay SuperBrony64 Wubbykins?
Naetaru: another reason I quit drinking :3
SO close but yet so Far
((At this point, I'm just fucking with him.))
They did get rid of it on some
14Look, I'm not saying that I dislike Android. I actually claimed the exact opposite of that, but I just don't think that you should tamper with a product of a different franchise just so you can put something else completely different on it that you could have just gone out and bought from the franchise you wanted in the first place.
FlareChaser: That means I shouldn't play it while drunk? o.o'
Naetaru: means you should :3
uh wait
what
14e.g. putting Android on an iPod touch
DO IT!
At least it has flash
/me flee
/me 11,01does it.
03I get what you're saying
FlareChaser: ... *glare* >:T
hey Princess_Molestia hows your day been
/me does something
How about this. If he wins I'll do a proposal to him LIVE at the next comic-con.
06wait people actually buy iPods and install android on them
03again, I only got an iPod Touch because I *had* to in order to rip Jammit tracks
I know one other operating system that doesn't have good flash
/me 11,01explodes
rhythm game! what is it?
How long has SB been playing!?
iOS will never have Flash
im in the middle of something!
03and now I don't want it anymore
It seems like Apple hasn't changed much under Tim Cook :(
03so if someone wants to buy this off me XD
Linux grr
03Samurott, not yet at least
(Or someone)
rhythm heaven fever? dat you?
03Contrary to popular belief
Princess_Molestia Is your horn any better,Sis?
WindWhistler: at least 3 months?
14I would buy your iPod touch off of you if I had the money.
12get phillips
You guys need to wait 5 years
:p
DONG DONG

Black Hole EvaporationJust now we have seen that a black hole "shines" with Hawking radiation. The escaping member of a virtual particle pair carried away energy from the black hole, and the black hole loses mass as a result. Eventually the black hole loses all its energy, or equivalently mass, and evaporates. Let's derive a formula to calculate the lifetime of a black hole. Jump CalculationThe power of Hawking radiation is just the s
11,01SuperBrony64 keeps failing at nearly the same spot.
03most of the fancier ones I've been to block their inputs :/

Rapping is not his strongest game
Morning everyone.

Airpuff: I think I need a drink. :D
Nittany_Discord, because that's what we called them

Hi AlienEd27
11,01kirzstryfe: I warned him already.
:D
Missed a pea.
poor SuperBrony64
03Take a picture of your girlfriend, put it on the TV stretched out
03see how ugly they look
03:D
/me hides
THAT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT HE DIDN'T PERFECT? ouch
LOL
/me hugs SuperBrony64
MAGIC MIRROR!
03he started listening to me
I do that on my laptop
You can do it SuperBrony64 *plays Rocky Music*
03after I proved my point
03...LOL what
LordDerpington: the only way to get peas is with a knife
I will physically KISS SuperBrony64 if he passes this.
Not a big deal
/me flee
already either the main board or backlight inverter board went bad
hi again Airpuff
03is it that hard to just not stretch stuff
kirzstryfe: Nittany_Discord warned him already
YOU'RE THE BEST AROUND
03if you're THAT paranoid
:3
Oo Hai AlienEd27 :D
03just chop the top and bottom off
03and zoom in
No one's ever gonna keep you down
03>_>
well
owlicious: I eat my peas with honey, I've done it all my life, it makes the peas taste funny, but it keeps them on the knife.
MUFFIN
i will let SuperBrony64 humiliate me in brawl if he does this :P
Poor SB....:'(
Zooming doesn't fix the black bars on the side problem
The irony is that SuperBrony64 is failing at the same part, for better or for worse.
On all the TVs I use
;D
03wait what?
11,01Alright FlareChaser
03why wouldn't it
LordDerpington: hoo, never heard of that before
I think SuperBrony64 is getting frustrated :o
8,6dderpy, stop with your spam or I'll stop you
Nittany_Discord: yes?
By the time you zoom in enough
at like 3-4x
kirzstryfe: de
GRR
lol
you can't even see what you're doing
03you don't need to zoom in that much
dderpy: If you're going to say anything muffin related, leave it for somewhere else.
03my TV has settings for it
Backspace is right above send -_-
03pillarbox, stretch, zoom
03o_O
owlicious: I think it was on a kids tape I used to have. Funny how things like that stick in your mind.
Anyway, dem colors >_>
SuperBrony64: look, just be calm ^^ you can do it ^^
kirzstryfe, what is with that color?
Keep it up SuperBrony64 !
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

anyways
*facehoof* that wall
I should try to look for my spare GC
Jeeze what is up with these idiots...
tehRequital|Drawing: :3
double up :D
and the SA2B disk
11,01Shizuka: Good double-team /)
03dude
I'm thinking that SuperBrony64 needs some cooldown. If he's going to keep making mistakes where he wasn't before, he needs to take a break.
Never give up. Never surrender!
13(\ :3
03stretching gamecube games
03is a sin :|
gahh
Shizuka: oh hai der :D
ouch
/)_(\
Ohana means family!
Great, now I'm feeling SB's frustration!
get on my level
alright, it's coloring time
SuperBrony64: TAKE A BREAK!
Tov
You don't press A to swing the chair SuperBrony64~
Shizuka: I wub woo
02^
Stop thinking you're the first dog..
In my spare time, I edit Bulbapedia.
08,01i really suck at brushie brushie
03this is probably one of few times I see eye to eye with artistic people :P
Shizuka is the one that made me rethink my Drinking habits.
DRF, stretching VGA res games to 720P isn't too bad
:D
/me flee
08,01my hair is waaaay too tangled
03because I think they usually understand the value of aspect ratios
/me claps
DB_Brony: Those are dogs? :o I thought they were pigs
08,01because i never brushie
does anypony here play crysis on pc?
03and why you shouldn't stretch them
I'll have what she's having!
Will I become an editing mod? No.
damnit sb
02yeah
11,02Litwick: You need to press A...
SuperBrony64: TAKE A BREAK!
03if not, take their artwork and start stretching it and they will
/me hides
I think he's getting more stressed...
02LO
08,01GabeMoist: ponies have way better hair than i
/me feels bad for SuperBrony64
02LOL
I think someone's addicted.
See DRF
WindWhistler: they look like bulldogs to me
NES fatigue. I tend to just work my way through it.
SuperBrony64: I meant you need to press A to stop the chair, not spin it.
I don't stretch GC game
WindWhistler: Agree :'(
s
Because I can't
xD
WindWhistler: They look like dogs to me
03why can't you o.o
oh man, try taking a water break
FlareChaser: i think u just found a new habbit other than drinking
Oh geez.
whos this doing that game?
Well, the stretching doesn't get rid of the bars enough to make it any better
SB64
:P
That's the only one he didn't perfect. :(
11,02Litwick: You need to press A to spin it though :/
03dude
SB: stream sea ponies, and try again?
03that's actually awesome
SuperBrony64, the more you play, the worse you'll do. Take a break and return later
03that means your TV doesn't use overscan
03:|
SB64: No you don't!
03I hate overscan so much x.x
SuperBrony64: whats B for?
I don't like the Wii very much. The controls for me are too nonintuitive.
02same
and
03it basically cuts off about 5% of the picture on all sides
Yeah
03mine lets you disable overscan, but only for HDMI
03not for standard def stuff :/
08,01the only reason i'm brushie brushie-ing, is because i'm about to re-pink it
Ouch
FlareChaser: B doesn't exist on a Wiimote. There's a Z button I think, 1 and 2 buttons.
I have a panasonic and Samsung TV
wait
whos playing the game?
no
B is the trigger.
hrm
Wood_stuck_to_a_pole: yeah, theres a B button on the wii silly!
Woodstuck... are you fucking kidding?
Oh.
08,01Airpuff: i... like pink?
Wood_stuck_to_a_pole: Z is on the nunchuck part
SuperBrony64 is playing, i believe
....how come surfing on youtube ended up at me watching anthology?
/me 08,01has pinkie pie hair... but currently ginger
Oh. I still don't like the Wii much.
sadly most of those are badly made
What the hell is this?
08,01my hair is naturally black and very, very curly
03woah
03that jailbreak program
I prefer PC gaming....ALWAYS PC GAMING!
lagalicious
03was a lot easier than the last one I used XD
The newer flat panel TV sets
/me refreshes stream
/me snuggles Airpuff.
Samsung downstairsa, but the TV upstairs is a panasonic veria
08,01Airpuff: yup, i pinked it before, and it faded
03Panasonic Viera
03is the best thing ever
GilDash: Welcome back :P
yeah
But
ok, now that I'm done with iPhoto now I can jailbreak
this one is a old model
::P
I seriously started crying when Halo 4 might be coming to PC.
03so is mine :/
Like 2008
03but the newer ones are awesome
Yay, I have a Viera that's a little older but it's still good
I have a 2010
FlareChaser: Why?
or was it 2009
Oh no Rapping >_<
Anyways, it is more than 2 years old
Oh here we go
08,01Airpuff: first
OUCH
AAAAH
Nooooooooo!
SuperBrony64: try again
I was playing Mario Kart: Double Dash not to long ago. The All Cup Tour 150cc stood in my way so long that I gave up on it years ago. I picked it up again recently, and had a similar problem to SuperBrony64's. Taking breaks were the key to finally pulling it off.
Bai everypony.
02ptttt
bye RainbowAsh
The TV I am working on is 2010
02I want one of these so bad:
02http://www.zeldacollectorsmuseum.com/2009/05/wind-waker-limited-edition-uk.html

I now have everything unlocked in that game. I got Mirror Mode, and I cleared all the cups in it.
GabeMoist: Yes I am

Airpuff: Just... tired, I guess.

GilDash: Ooh.. you xD

/me curls up in a corner staring at Airpuff and GilDash <.<

GilDash: That was be heading off early.

LordDerpington, I just loved that shot that's all
03of course I did

03jailbroken iPods are worth more
Ninjazz: Then you need to head off "early" more often. :)
03because usually people are scared to hack one themselves

My stomach drops every time he messes up...
03and Samurott, around $150
GilDash: Actually... Come to think of it... It's me, my dog Pondus and Airpuff sharing the same bed until Thursday |3

/me hoofs over cider to Airpuff.
Quite
Airpuff: It's really good. :)
/me drinks the cider "aaaah thanks"
This game kicks so much ass :D

panda: No. I can't stand hot drinks. :S
GilDash: Om is coffee flavoured.
Have fun, FlareChaser|TF2!
Have fun with TF2 FlareChaser|TF2
that's my school btw
You get silver coins for every kill you get with a single reflected missile
Michael Bay style!
boom shaka laka XD
GilDash: Oi. Perfect solution. Ice coffee.
Kriss Kross will make you… JUMP JUMP
LOL!XD
So using those missiles really racks your points up
Ninjazz: I know. It's not that I don't like coffee flavour, it's just hot drinks. :)

Mushrooms!
GilDash: .. Hmpf.. one with beef?
GilDash: It's not a drug... It's a magic powerder that helps you... not sleep. Perfectly understandable.
Airpuff: Meat feast perhaps...?
Ninjazz: Drug.
hi

GilDash: Caffeine is one hell of a drug. Needed to say that. :D

Somebronyyayz: lol. it is a fun game
Gamer_Luna: <3 *cuddles back*
03wel

necroshadow123: I thought the same thing. Trust me, it's not as bad as you think it will be and its very liberating
03never knew if it actually ment anything
03*meant

02inb4: trolldad with cam
GilDash: Ikr. :D
I only have CoD4 on the Wii
Why!?!?!
B-b-b-but...you said you'd play Rayman afterwards...D:
lol
sagas: i thought that way at first bu then there are people who will make fun of my size (i am very small for my age)
this T_T
MahBoi777: So...? ;)
Wait, there's a mw3 for the wii?
How the hell does MW3 on the wii even work?
/me is sure that this is just while he looks for the game
when did that happen?
I WAS RIGHT
RainbowcrashNBurn: awesome :D
is an epic chat ROOM!:D
Oh thank god
02it probably was a clip from a video
Yeah!
YAY!:D
Rayman? RAYMAN!!!! :$
03could be
SuperBrony64: ooh i need to get that off steam
I was hoping for Arkham City
MahBoi777: Don't worry, dude. Just do anything I would do then you won't get on the List.
GilDash: u are relentless, u know that?
03I keep telling my dad to just use a video camera
11,02I'll play some of this and then some of MW3 :)
i have this game thats a demo for my 3DS
03he goes around snapping 27 pictures of everything
03and makes us pose forever
02lmao
SB playing Rayman? This will be good. :)
031080p, 30 frames per second, done
03I mean, his camera isn't even that great, it's like 4-5 megapixels?
MahBoi777: I think the word you're looking for is teneacious. ;)
SuperBrony64: Do you have CoD4?
031080p is 2MP
03so yeah
MahBoi777: Nothing I would do*
I 100%ed this, it's an ace game! :D
i can only do a success on the first level i suck at the other levels!XD
Isn;t Rayman still a failed franchise?
SuperBrony64: Are you sure people will WANT to watch you play MW3?
nonono
I would WindWhistler
Rayman used to be my favorite! :)
lol a song
SB i was gonna Brawl you... but its all good you do whatever XD
lunac: nnnope
Lorem Ipsum is standard filler text
02I hate it when some people take 100+ pictures of everything thinking they're a pro
MahBoi777: Perhaps incorrigable... That's a good word too. ;)
I still vote for Arkham City instead
Raymon?
02XD
03but does it actually *mean* anythign?
03and BlueFlare, me too
/me gives GilDash a neclace with "Tenacious" written on it.
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:5aeR1wqNZr0J:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=nz
03I take pictures of scenery, but yeah
btw Ninjazz about the discussion we had yesterday, there was something i remember right after i left and i wanted to mention it
Rayman was one of the first games I owned on the Game Cube
03People used to make fun of me for doing that
wtf
03"There's not even anybody in that picture, why are you taking it?"
twilight_sprinkle: Hmmm?
"In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum[1] is placeholder text (filler text) commonly used to demonstrate the graphics elements of a document or visual presentation, such as font, typography, and layout.

Airpuff: What, you want to tip them off? :D
EPIC SONG!
o.O
GilDash: ;)
03but hey, I look at Articuno and Xai's honeymoon pix, half of those are scenery, so obviously I'm not the only one to do that :P
Platform game + weed= Rayman
02I just chose the right setting, take one or two pics, and done
bu buh buh bababuh buh
lol
My computer just put itself into sleep mode...
Get enough electoons DED
02choose*
This gameplay reminds me of Robot Unicorn Attack
03well I take a few due to my camera sucking
GilDash: yea, those words are perfect
03but if it involves people
Ninjazz: remember the ep with gilda? pinkie called her evil and twi didnt hate her even though she thought she was being jealous
I'm bored."Hug attacks Irish_Pony"
03I don't make them stay posed for 5 minutes while I focus my camera
02XD
03my dad has a DSLR
MahBoi777: So, now you know about me, let's here a little about you. ;)
03so he has to manually focus it
02I can focus my camera in just a few secs
/me vanishes for shenanigans
twilight_sprinkle: She called her a bully.
Gamer_Luna: Aw you...*hugs back* <3
fail
03one benefit to point and shoot is you don't have to deal with that
twilight_sprinkle: I'm sure you're comparing the Wedding episode to that
twilight_sprinkle: But, go on.
03I can just take like 4-5 pictures and be done
epic song for the dieing lol
sagas: during speedruns that's pretty much the gameplay :D
Considering he;s playing live for a lartge audience he sin't doing bad
03http://chzfailnation.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/epic-fail-knowing-your-fruits-fail.jpg
02dSLRs have awesome auto focus
03do they?
02yep
03my dad insists on focusing manually
03maybe he's just dumb
Ninjazz: she called her evil at some point too. the point is that twi reacted with understanding and didnt hate at all
03he strikes me as a wannabe pro photographer
03XD
GilDash: I like Dinner, The End
WindWhistler: partially.
;lol
Dem hip thrusts
the monsters get fat when they die
some of the time autofocus is fine
im looking forward to rayman legends :)
MahBoi777: Who's Dinner? :)
02I only focus manually if I have all the time in the world to take my picture
03like he buys this Nikon DSLR because it works "better" than his point and shoot
depend how good AF is
03that being said
then he dose his hump dance!XD
03the camera brand he used to like
03is Olympus
but if you want to achieve specific FX, then go manual
03those cameras are absolutely awful
my fav song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qgmxPb-ego
03they take like 10 seconds to snap a photo
03so no wonder >_>
Gamer_Luna: I can tell were gonna go far...<3
LOL
Derpyty: they inflate like bubbles and then busrst :D
The quality seems lower than usual...
i know
oooh, new character
GilDash: the one thing I can't live without
First boss stage!
twilight_sprinkle: Okay...
03as much as I hate Son
i just say they get fat
03y
03the Cyber Shot point and shoot cameras are awesome
03I literally did a test once
oh this is gonna get good
necroshadow123: dat song.. xD
03SHAKE the camera as hard as I could while taking a picture
MahBoi777: Nopony has to find out. ;)
03almost no blur :P
No one spoil for SB. :|
Ninjazz: i mean that they couldv reacted like her
Ninjazz: but didnt
Irish_Pony Yeah,not only here in BronyState but also Dvart ;)
the buh ba bah SONG IS BACK!:D or not D:
twilight_sprinkle: For one thing, Gilda wasn't getting married and having them help out
Gamer_Luna: Oh...my...<3
twilight_sprinkle: But, see, dude. Twilight accused Cadence INFRONT of alot of important ponies. Pinkie was simply talking to Twilight.
GilDash: no thanks
bye bye coin lol
MahBoi777: Aw, no fun. :(
WindWhistler: she was an old friend of dash though

MahBoi777: It's okay. I'll keep working on ya. ;)
/me kisses Gamer_Luna back <3
Ninjazz: thats just a tachnicality, the reasoning were about the same

DerpSurge: I know but its only on wii, right?
BUH BA BAH SONG IS BACK!:D
aww now it gone
03well most of the stuff my dad takes is inside pictures
twilight_sprinkle: I don't think so, dude. Compare being called evil infront of a crowd and people will react differently than just two friends talking about someone else behind their back.
those poor red wizards
YAY
D:
Rayman is getting needles stuck on them
DerpSurge: Sweet! I know what Im getting next!
Irish_Pony May I have premission to draw Maor a lot with Shadow? :$

lol
3,4, or 2
Gamer_Luna: I can really tell were gonna go far...<3
wait 3 fails
i say about 4 times
twilight_sprinkle: The princess, Shining Armor, the mane 6. All these ponies knew Cadence as she were before them. Only Twilight speculated that she was evil. Obviously, there would have been SOME disdain between them all and Twilight. Perhaps dissappointment on her for making a bride to be cry?
ok
dat wall
DISCORD WHATEVER DID WE DO? to make you take our world awaaaaaaaaaaaaay

SuperBrony64: Is it possible that you could get me laid? No prostitut would do me so I was hoping that a boss like you could help me
08,01CupcakeWarrior: since the 70s, i believe
11,02I love CoD, sure it might not be an original game, but sometimes it's a matter of content being different than just the actual gameplay that makes things cool...or at least it's just with CoD ><
13protocol was finalized in 1983 i think
Shizuka: I meant the protocol
13i'd have to double check
hey Kipkat07_Mare
xXxSc00t_C0mm4nd0xXx: I once got 107-3 in a game of domination ... Rushing shotgun only XD
ohi
11,01CoD isn't a bad game.
13or rather it was introduced in 83
13the last major RFC for it was very early 90s i think
08,01according to wiki, 1988
11,02Kipkat07_Mare: Well, that's not really an appropriate topic to discuss publically in chat, but I wouldn't be the best person to talk about that anyway.
00,03Shotties are such an MLG weapon~
