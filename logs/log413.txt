08,01then i say
E.G., go bowling.
Dat Julius Caesar
08,01i know that!
Close enough.
Most Armies insist their goal is to end the fighting as quickly as possible, in line with Sun Tzu's instructions on the matter.

And then pinkie pie had control over all baked goods
As if she didn't all ready
And that's how Equestria was destroyed.
ie: Protracted wars are a bad idea.
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend" - Sun Tzu
I don't think Sun Tzu said that...
he did
She currently only has indirect control of all baked goods
Did somebody say Zoo?

good afternoon, all.
I don't see the show with any problems, There's no large complaints from audience, has massive viewings, probably even receives generous donations, It'd seem like a huge thing to fall back away from all that success this early?

Yeah, you might wanna wear gloves whilst handling that.

i got more DOS worksheets
i'll do them later :P
mm that was nice curry
yes.
There wouldn't be one -they'd be convinced they'd never get one
just kidding i was there for just like a week.
D:
i was there for 30 years i should know
where?
equastria.
it was great
If I had to guess, though, I'd say an open book. One, I have over 700 books and two, I have nothing to hide.
boy it was great to be with fluttershy
-bites one of Triple's ears off-
why you did that?
If I was a pony, I'd probably be a unicorn. It just makes most sense to me

wtf?
yea there was a 30 year war
wtf you did there for 60 years
with the miasma

Hello.

Ok, according to mlp.wikia, the best night ever aired on may 6, 2011
my little shoes: shoes are shoes
I know
its only to finish the episodes sooner
I just hope the artwork remains consistant.
these shoes are made for walkin
the trippiness has been doubled!
lol
Now that we're done with season 1, what's everypony's thoughts on season 2?
-_-
ello
CECH C02 model, has SACD logo on the side
why u guys up to
And was more character driven
Everything and nothing at the same time.
any OTHER suggestions?
Just watching the concert makes me feel high
Is twilight learning this concert?
But ok!
The concert os Twi's imagination
is*
She's reading Concerts for Dummies
Nah, Twilight is too much of a goody-goody to go to a concert :D
"Did you say DRUGS?!"
03wait, you found a SACD one?
dat EQD banner
I need to go.
yes?
bai everl- he's gone
03so you have two PS3s now?
the point of buying a PS3 is ONLY for SACD
i sold off the other one to my friend yesterday
03oh
I liked Read it and Weep a lot
i like Baby cakes
03is yours old firmware?
anyone else here wanna get drunk with me?
03and nice
03good find :P
i would but when i get drunk i get murdery
2and Blu-Ray
i'm buying a console for ZERO games
beatthat!
03now go rip me SACDs
03junh1024-XD me too
03I don't use mine for games
03but yeah I do use it to play Blu-Rays
>tells me to rip SACDs
>?doesn't even play my surround mixes
>MFW
03but still has oddities
And S2 had...well, they never said.
*gets vodka* lets drink!
/me downs beer
track i?
yes! *toasts Merc_Xephos*
03yeah track, not album
03because they're all different albums
/me drinks beer and becomes sober
*drinks vodka*
03I used a VM with the newer Winamp
Goddamit
1,3had a customer at work today, moved just like a boomer from L4D2, even made the noises >.<
also note no volume analysis algorithm is prefect.
*gets drunk*
i beleiove most RG ones use the old RMS
03but I still have to fix More and More due to >really quietintro
03+space
And then a bunch of other customers flooded the store.
Yes :) legend of korra
there are newer ones like loudness and perceived loudness which may use weighting curves
maybe i'm latching onto the vocal levels
...
Not sure if Laughable or disturbed
There we go...
03I usually focus on the first note you hear
ugh surry
03since that kinda determines if it's too loud or not
Its set 40-50 years after Anngs time, Korra being the next incarnation. Looks like it's got potential.
