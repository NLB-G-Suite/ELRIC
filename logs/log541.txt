awesome.
great idea
04But my cousins are legends now
See, you have to stop him before he eats all the pellets.
00,02well shit
00,02it happened again
00,02cher3ry, you have to land on engines sometime
00,02s
00,02kinda needed that engine
even*
everytime I've tried it blew up.
04We don't talk to each other anymore
OOOPS
Pffffffft xD
you shouldn't need to land on the engine..
00,02there we go
04He was...until he stole my last taquito
00,02cher3ry, there is a way to land THIS craft without
04Haven't spoken in 4 years
00,02but its imposibly hard
00,02if there was a flight computer, i might be able to make it happen
Tacos, Taquitos, Burritos
a good reason why you don't talk anymore, imo.
00,02one more try
00,02and then i pressed the wrong button
taking one's food is SRS BSNS
Guess you're not on the best of terms with Bill Murray, huh?
04FUCK BILL MURRAY
lol
00,02Lil_B, when i'm playing something else
/me felt avenged when he was shot and killed in Zombieland
TF2
Usually
but he was just acting in the credits. :3
tx
04How dare he subject all those ghosts...this is discrimination at its ugliest
^_^
np
i blame zuuuuul.
ZUUUUUUL
needs moar boom
no decoupler
that wont end well
inb4 the solids detachment blows up the liquids
or that.
00,02then something else
dat makkon!
00,02woah
00,02dis thing is fast
decent design there
um yeah
00,02huh
00,02i need a circular body
yo
00,02then i could have two more of those epic sized boosters
6 clustes of 6?
00,02dis has a LOT of fuel
00,02Mutterguy, 7 rockets, 4 tanks each
00,02i dont think i can turn this thing
ok 6 cluters of 7
Instead of circular, how about triangular, and arrange wheels from all angles... then it matters less how you land, I think
00,02its just used the second layer
or even square...
00,02of tanks
00,02and its allmost in orbit
hi
well you are burning 14 rockets
got any food on you?
00,02inb4 these two boosters end up in orbit
:3
00,02have to ditch them
:P
00,02dats a nice orbit
00,02and i still have a layer of tanks left
00,02these things are gona be stuck in orbit
00,02unless....
unless?
00,02dere gona re-enter now
and I believe you dont have any parachutes?
Phase4...all the...space?
either reentry or they'll burn up in the sun
00,02Irish_Pony, i have chutes
00,02three on the nose, 4 on the body
00,02Shamroc, after this launch
wewt

00,02Irish_Pony, ?
roomate just moved out and not sure if my brother is here at all
00,02strange
00,02those boosters should be slowing
00,0246KM is in the atmosphere
00,02ah well, it did slow a little
going to have to move downstairs eventually, upstairs needs some remodeling and the roof is getting repaired

TF2 now? B&W mode.. Deactivate *BOOP*
13hai

13thanks
np
Rain: Tell me more.
but the culture is on the verge of extinction
Rain whats close to extinction
stomach area I mean
traditional native american culture
Look to how the moari culture survived. in the 1950's it was nearly extinct now it's thriving again
ok ^_^
pretty much
though it probably takes goverment level ofinterference that's probably considered reprehensible by US standards
no
Funy Junk is horrid
No thet's just proff it's working. um there were a bunch of primary school language classes in the early 90's . We were being taught to speak in Moari at school
oooh and Party.mov is out too
dat pinkie pie
asdfghjklöä''''
Of course i buggered off to England when I was 10 and missed it
04The Whale Rider was a movie that came out in recent years about a little girl from a part of the Maori that is destined to become a leader
Rain: I don't know any tribes. I usually just go researching online and learn as I go.
Rain: Creek?
and cherokie
Toys R us for pony toys :P
Rain: Are you listing tribes or do you have all of those tribes part of you?
I have each of those tribes in my blood
yeah ther might have some relisation they were going all about it the wrong way. English being the only language taught because it's the onl one important enough to learn then they realised all these cultures were due to disappear...
Rain: Interesting, Thanks. I'll have a look at all of those. Starting with Creek.
^_^
Rain, you're more american than a lot of self-proclaimed americans :D
naaaaaah

04It's fine, XAX...just...don't do those jokes to me anymore
Jokes?
about 30-45 minutes
I like jokes!
A man walks into a bar. Ow.
lawl
not underclocking the cpu or anything
:D
I dunno
CPU usage seems far too high
"Where's my tractor?"
04A man walks into a bar. His alcoholism is destroying his family.
idk
he ate his pizza before it was cokl
/me loves "not jokes"
cool*
04Yeah, "not jokes" or anti jokes
04Love 'em
when on the battery
I laughed too hard at that not joke

Probably not an issue
04Like there is ZERO set up
At this stage
Two men walk into a bar. You'da thought one of them would've seen it.
04Just WHAM
my processor is HT'd anyway
sorta
lol
I'd rather have it underclocked than overclocked
04Well, yeah
Anyone can use color. You'll just get kicked instantly as soon as you do, is all.
04^
heh
04Users aren't allowed to use color
:( why?
oh
I was using 9 before on my old laptop
Which was still using GNOME 2
04Because only the mods may use color
use+`r' *facehoof*
04I can
04I don't want to, though
but it could be my laptop
04I've been 'red' since the very first BMN
Well
When I manage my servers
04And that was before I was even a mod
ya
user user user user use her
But for personal use, always GUI
The mods tend to use distinguishing colours among themselves for sake of ease.
Also
I'm going in a programming competition in a few weeks
Why?
And the IRCops, if they want to.
any prizes?
Yeah
money
04Though they are technically not supposed to ><
like how much
and scholarship
04"You've been taught you should really carry no less than 5 computers on you at all times, like a sensible person."
er
04NS, take notes.
it was $3000 or $6000, can't remember
infared cops. scary
o_o
geez
i am curious
But it's a $3000 scholarship if you come top 6th with the prize money
http://www.computing.unsw.edu.au/school-programs/progcomp/prizes.html
wat
oh
$5000 first prize
o_o
oh
But it'll be hard
And I've never done this sort of thing before
broooown :)
You hvae 2 hours to do 5 questions

04Haha
http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~progcomp/pastcomps.php
lol cgi
Darkblondish. But it's shaved atm.
http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~progcomp/pop.php?loc=2011opentasks#task5 is quite annoying
but 5 of those questions in 2 hours
you have like 25 minutes for each
240 minutes / 5
04Dunno
04You'd have to ask him
i see
about 28 minutes I think
Under the mods, of course.
I cbf to properly calculate that
wow long load time for me
and even though it's team
Bye bye everypony!!
you only have one computer

lol mirc
yeah lol mirc
processing power of mIRC is crap
Are you sure it's a he...
also lol VB
I'm going to stay away from C++
04I dunno
to make sure my brain doesn't die
04On the net, you always go by the rule that everyone is male
But the good thing about mIRC is that it's easy
04That is for the people you don't know
04Like
04I know Luna is female
because mIRC's syntax is pretty logical
How do you know?!?
Skype
lift up the skirt?
oh ok
not even thinking about perl

Kayne West I believe
is the stream not working or is it just me?
hello!
Which way is the proper way to store it? Horizontal or vertical?
Also I ruined my Banjo and Kazooie Nuts and Bolts disc
Note to self NEVER MOVE THE CONSOLE WITH A DISC IN IT
Damnit! WTF! for the last couple months ill ive been thinking about is ponies! MAKE IT STOP!!! D:
it warns very specifically against that
And besides I was trying to figure out which way is the proper way to store the concole
is it supposed to go vertical or horizontal?
:(
I moved the console
and heard a loud sound
That or Altzheimer.
I lost my Gears2 disk doing that...
it was terrifying
I ejected the disc when it made a moise
I just simply forgot how good it was
I think I'm gonna use that from now on.
*noise
I didn't read the manual
/me nods
Reading mauals is for squares
Note to self always leave the magnet that holds disc down before turning on
I don't have much to say today. Not in as much pain but quite woozy. ~_~
Which way is the proper way to store it? Vertical or horizontal?
I've got my Xbox placed horizontally. Haven't had any problems yet, though it is starting to make a little more noise than usual.
:D
It's in front of the window
horisontal
I've always had it vertical..is that bad?
