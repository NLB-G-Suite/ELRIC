Mica
If one went to sleep with this song on loop, what do you think might happen?
I really like the scootaloo part in this for some reason
what?
was that?
00,10you would not get a very good nights sleep
Om: recurring nightmares, followed by therapy?
Sumi
Om: they would lose their mind, regain it, crack it, reform it, then explode and then reform

will be played at funeral
Lunar_Brony: eeyup

oh.
gnight brony_swan
I didn't know Zecora had a theme
this is amusing
Reminds me of Disney's song.
I saw a few clips about Bronycon on YT and I have to agree with people that someone should tell the MCs they dont have to shout into the microphone. Thats the whole point.
I think I did pick it up
i never noticed any of this music..
dang
kenne: dude, I've seen that one before!
/me brings out Maraccas
Zecora would pwn in a Rap Battle
kenne That is so very very wrong. But attractive.
Roboham89: You aint a brony then :P
kenne: forget where though
she's the ONLY zebra you know
so the moral of the parachute is this ALWAYS BRING A BACK UP CHUTE
but..
D:
why is it no voice and all text?
otakon: got like a foot and a half by 2 ft poster of it in a case of hard plastic
Mica. You should show them FS's montage BGM only. :)

HECK NAWW

Sumica: What is that one, again?
Sumica can you do my suggestion
what language did she speak in french version?6_9 english?
Sumica I thought the episode count was 52 . . . or do you mean ep9 s2?

And thus, the village of the Blanks is born.
i need the math cutie mark...hate calculus
Yeah, I dunno how they'll fit that in for the French version. The cutie mark is a classical French symbol, but it does have some other meanings in French itself, I think.
Random helmets. XD
I know! My cutie mark could be ignoring really important things in my life! . . . wait, that's normal for every teenager
00,10can still here AB off camera
CrimsomPhoenix Yes I did. Thanks.
wait.. tails can be used as "hands"?

wouldnt it help me though? make me smarter in math
Pinkie Music time :P

Pinkie Pie. X3
^
the entire library is ruined and yet Twi is taking it surprisingly well
Quick_Thinker: Magic will fix everything
Quick_Thinker, I guess she's used toit
was that a triple negative?
She's taking it as well as the odd Kerbal out
magic will fix it slowly
its not ruined. Just disorganized (taking THAT well, though) - but if ONE book is damaged, there'll be Celestia to pay
/me nibbles on Zapdos
This episode is kinda quiet, ain't it?
Wait...
Applebrap: No, it's building
yay
Yeah, i forgot the episode just began. :D
Huh wha?
Fail tab. Sorry.
nou
man i already think i might have to change the story i made in fanfic (i have an idea that the enitre library explodes and twi goes nuts)
I /love/ how detailed this magic effect is.
:D Pinkie is really lucky and resourceful
Rarity shows her concen for RD.
whoaaaa
i need to go to KFC sometime
woah
00,10there is a new FiW?
#7
Sumica, Episode 7 is out

00,10ho sheet

the heck dective music?
dat snapping
Oh snappy.
never noticed it before
Gangster music!
I love it :3
apparently those 3 are detectives
It's parodying The Last Roundup. And you won't believe what was done to Derpy.
also know as street side musical dance off battle music
Kandarihu: :'(
no spoilers, Kandarihu
Kandarihu: Oh gawd.
Not to mention Pinkie defies the laws of physics
Kandarihu: metal vocals? :D
I'm not saying anything.
http://i.imgur.com/TXQQx.jpg
fluttershy helped
>perform a duet
Kandarihu oooh that was part of the joke
what?
That would be very nice for season 3
Do I hear pixie music...? XD
my god
CrimsonPhoenix: :O canonized names! <3
00,10pinkie with her troll face on.
Um, no. I'm just mentioning that the way it approached the famous Derpy scene had me laughing. I'm not spoiling.
that, and AJ and Twi are... "yeah, lets let Pinkie test to make sure the spell actually worked first."
so have they even explained why they can walk on clouds and others can't?
octavia is obviously in canterlot, so that means that Vinyl is in ponyville :O
Rain: Can be found :P
Quick_Thinker: apparently anything that can fly can cloudwalk... birds can land on clouds too.
wb
This reminds me of the 60s Disney...
bullshit
couldn't sleep?
HO SHIT! That's an legit card?
but then again its thier show
Quick_Thinker: nah. Probably hollow bones like birds?
Rain: Orly

stop with the music being soo loud please?
where your fears and horrors come true
The Rainbow Factory
I was looking through my collection and I have tons of repeats
besides my eevee and eeveelution collection
Bad Rarity bad
i don't really have any spare old cards
gonna give most of them to skylands when we meet
00,02problem with the super low orbits my new rocket requires: you cant warp faster than 2x so its practically real time

Octavia: No...your not...
Spicy! *whinny*

I love that theme

OH GOD
I was never into it

Rarity's Laugh is coming....
although Equestrian basketball must resemble quittich.
WAHAHAAAAAAAAAA
Oh thank god it was muted XD
WA-haHA!
Wah a h HAH
Granny Recolour!
Dat sudden music.
And out comes Paranoid RD
00,10still wonder why they have lab coats for ponys with out wings
And my reaction to waHAHAH!
but yeah
hmm
I also have tons of the same energy cards
which are useless
Lol
they are quite cheap yes
equestrian clothes are obviously magic - they grow or lose wingholes as appropriate for the wearer
Sumica, because unicorn Lyra is in the stands
Sumica: Always be prepared for anything. >.>
i dont think those are lab coats more of the line workers cloths
Sumica it's not like they need to add holes or anything...
WWOWOWfwop]
Sumica: extreme preparation
Sumica: Maybe for injuries? Or pony who get in horrible accdents and end up one wing short.
i heard vendors were buying energy for 6 cents each though last i checked
Quick_Thinker just died
because science
I mean
why does everything hate my ears
00,10seems they would move ponies liek taht to the ground
useless in that they aren't tournament legal anymore and not worth collecting
:P
Derpy :3
Quick_Thinker may be just turn down the volume?
Good morning everypony.
nahh thats the turky thing to do
Winged Caramel.
Hey there, Malavolent!
Derpy Plot!
00,10not much music in this one
Dat Derpy flank :3
but we are greeted with one hell of a theme
AHAHAHAHAHA
Only real music cue is the rainboom.
*shudder*
basic energy cards are never non-tournament legal
Now comes HUGETheme Roll!
/me cheers for contestant #4
Frankly, I appreciate a good balance between music and no music.
and im gonna kill my self before the sonic rainboom music kills me
Now comes a 4-6 minute music roll Mica :P Here's where all the focus went
/me gets gun and fires
/me has died
Effective Use of Silence FTW

Assasination wasn't that much of a success.

LOOOL Quick_Thinker XD
everyone notice that right after the rainboom, Lyra is in the stands, jumping up and down.
cher3ry a best pony type unicorn ^-^
im back
Rain: No... I didn't. :S
00,10clearly lyra learned the spell from twi.
Wb.
Sumica: Eeeyup
00,10She's always doing it in all the fic's
Rarity with all that make up looked like shite :|
Lyra is stalking Twilight
For anyone who doesn't understand this edit, this is a "Vocal Free" version. With the voices and sfx edited out so that we can pay attention to the soundtrack itself.
She's Twi's friend in background Pony... sort of.
for one reason or another
MadSurge yeah... not the best look for her :(
hehe
Admired quick BGM :P
Celestia Theem!
even clestia has a good theme
http://pages.ebay.com/link/?nav=item.view&id=160828856525
Welp, Spells might come under libary media

Aesop? As in learning a lesson?
00,10yeah
ok so the fukcing SONIC RAINBOOM IS BUTCH BUT THE CHEERING IS LIKE A BFG9000 BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT
The moral of the story kind of thing.
Lol Quick_Thinker :P
ahhhh shit
SHE GOT A GOD DAMN PLAN
I've got plans...
That sounded wrong.
She got plans :D
maybe the moral should be "when you're falling to your death, and the bucking airforce of Equestria is trying to rescue you, don't buck them all in the face."
^
She's got several goddamn plans with the Wonderbolts
Hey!
But Yeah I'm supirised as you are Mica
/me 13yawns
Ah, well. She's bad ass strong. :P
cher3ry, I think she was flailing uncontrollably.
There was some new themes in it, and the whole 4-6 minute end was full of music, but most of it was rather silent. Hmmm
also, why do you guys use buck when you mean something else? it makes AJ's job just seem really terrible..
Well looks like Shizuka is sleepy ^-^

That Iron Giant theme
truly a hero
I c what u did thar Kandarihu
RAINCLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUD
whenever anypony is telling them what specifically is going on, the other five ignore it. Same as FiW 1 when Pinkie immediately identifies the Parasprites and the solution, clearly
Wait WHAT
WHIPLASH
rain clowd :'(
/me crys for rainclowd
Suuuuupaaaahhhh maaaannn*closes eyes*
/me cries from the nostalgia
Dat theme.
/me everyone we must now hold funerals for Cloud it cerimony is tommorw please attend if possible
That was lame
ahh shit
YAY
okay now everypony dont take all of them
I must admit thought it wasn't as strong as the recently previous ones
All dem fillies <3
Thanks for streaming Sumica =3
cher3ry, I found it especially funny that in FiW 1, Pinkie Pie was EXPLICITLY telling everypony what she was up to, whereas in the episode it parodied, she wasn't clear enough.
4 and 5 are still my top episodes
Aye. Thanks for the stream, Sumi.
Thanks for streaming, Sumi
Thanks for streaming, Sumica.
bye Sumica
Kandarihu: yes, which was what made that bit a good parody. This time they tried basically the same bit, but for no reason other than lol silly fillies
Sleep well!
i take it Sumica leaving
have good night Sumica

/me who died tragically in a inciddent invloving a bomb and some ponys
A cloud will simply reform
Goodnight everyone
I admit that this one doesn't seem to advance the Myth Arcs in any noticable way. Maybe this is going to be referred to in later episodes.
/me is there any one here would lik to say some words?
Gnight, Cobellanez. Take care.
Some words.
Maybe Rain Cloud will be one of the two remaining ressurections from Pinkie's portal.
I thought her parents were the last two ressurections.
(okay so i have never been to funeral just saw one on tape so i know some of the procedures but not all SO SUE ME
well everypony im off i'll let my brother take over
Cya, Quick_Thinker. Take care.
HEY EVERY PONY THIS IS QUICK's bro named Flash

Right, there can never be too much Doctor Who :3
There is, however, too little; some of the early episodes are missing.

So Ghosties is Clyde, huh?
00,02well shit
04I dunno, I'm just cousins to every ghost
I'm impressed. Lost an engine but you actually almost landed ON an engine.
00,02it happened again
00,02cher3ry, you have to land on engines sometime
00,02s
if casper the friendly ghost? :3
00,02kinda needed that engine
even*
everytime I've tried it blew up.
00,02well double shit

you shouldn't need to land on the engine..
00,02there we go

00,02cher3ry, there is a way to land THIS craft without
but if you want to do so, pretty sure you have to kill your forward momentum
04Haven't spoken in 4 years
00,02but its imposibly hard
00,02if there was a flight computer, i might be able to make it happen
Tacos, Taquitos, Burritos
Dat PARTY
a good reason why you don't talk anymore, imo.

00,02last rocket
00,02then something else
dat makkon!
00,02woah
00,02dis thing is fast
decent design there
um yeah
00,02huh
00,02i need a circular body
yo
00,02then i could have two more of those epic sized boosters
6 clustes of 6?
00,02dis has a LOT of fuel
00,02Mutterguy, 7 rockets, 4 tanks each
00,02i dont think i can turn this thing
ok 6 cluters of 7
Instead of circular, how about triangular, and arrange wheels from all angles... then it matters less how you land, I think
00,02its just used the second layer
or even square...
00,02of tanks
00,02and its allmost in orbit
hi
well you are burning 14 rockets
got any food on you?
hay Ghosties
/me hugs Phase4
00,02inb4 these two boosters end up in orbit
/me 00,02hugs VioletGreySha back
:3
Phase4: why must you doubt your own rocket? :P
00,02no, i meen as space junk
00,02have to ditch them
Phase4: oh..:P:D
he has lots of space junk
its turning into WALL-E
:P
00,02dats a nice orbit
00,02and i still have a layer of tanks left
00,02these things are gona be stuck in orbit
00,02unless....
unless?
you'd be given the boot in NZ. i'm sure being a tidy kiwi would also apply to space program adminstrators
00,02dere gona re-enter now
and I believe you dont have any parachutes?
Phase4...all the...space?
either reentry or they'll burn up in the sun
00,02ohai Shamroc
00,02Irish_Pony, i have chutes
00,02three on the nose, 4 on the body
ohai Phase4...i need some LA noire with all you're failsors
00,02Shamroc, after this launch
wewt
woo~
Phase4: isnt that over-doing it much?
04<VioletGreySha> hay Ghosties <-- Hello
dat late hello
00,02Irish_Pony, ?
this is the quietest night Ive ever had insomnia - usually get woken up from some drinking party my brother & roomate is holding downstairs
Irish_Pony: horrible idea
Phase4: I ment about the chutes :P
roomate just moved out and not sure if my brother is here at all
00,02strange
00,02Irish_Pony, nope
sounds lovely, Cypresswolf.
00,02those boosters should be slowing
00,0246KM is in the atmosphere
00,02ah well, it did slow a little
:) It gets better, in a month when my sister goes back to college, I get both bedrooms downstairs - going to turn those into 1 huge room
awesome. what are you going to use all the space for? :3
going to have to move downstairs eventually, upstairs needs some remodeling and the roof is getting repaired
DAT RAINBOW FACTORY.
Im thinking of playing TF2 but the thing is, who the hell is playing TF2 at 5 am :P
Irish_Pony: europeans? it's 11 AM here
MadSurge: then wouldnt it seem strange that a bunch of French guys are yelling at me and I have no idea what theyre saying? :P
well, with both rooms combined, itll be far bigger than my room now, down size some things eventually, but Ill be able to display EVERYTHING - ponies, anime figures, artworks, bring in all my shelves ^_^ Gonna be SO AWESOME
it's nice playing with other people sometimes.
learn their ways, their tactics, their language. it's smart.
Irish_Pony: :D not all servers have people yelling in it
then... use it against them. >:3
MadSurge: I beg to differ :D
?
Cypresswolf: sounds likt a great idea, actually!
no i don't
aww
My technique is: go behind a corner and wait for someone to spray with fire :D
:D
so Phase4 what exactly are you doing?
00,02landing
original plan was to remodel the upstairs hall to incorporate all that, but too much junk right now. cant do anything until the roof is fixed first - one room up here - blocked off completly - has mold on the ceiling sheetrock, hall is too thin to put anything else
00,02attempting to
LEEROY JENKINS then?
Phase4: good luck with that :P
00,02ooo
00,02dats a close pass
00,022.324k
00,02dats a VERY close pass, i think i'm going to hit something
00,02should probably put landing gear on the fuel tanks
04Oh wow, I know who came up with the "I'VE GOT A PLAN" thing
04Neato
00,02if i dont loose the center rocket
I just realized, with my roomate gone, I have to mow the grass on my own again, and finish repairing the fence he started
00,02this SHOULD work
Ghosties: who then?
00,02after this, more la noire
yay
04He's someone from BronyState

Ninjazz: I've been REALLY busy IRL.

Not THAT kind of detail, Ninjazz :S
Phase4: I think the Kerbals are thinking: "WERE SCREWED! GET US OUT OF HERE!"
Ugh, Not on this chatroom

00,02JRP2234[Silly_Filly], i wish
00,02if i could hack them. i'd fire the managment
Also, yeah. Rarity drawn as a real horse xD
it's just that it's kinda... realistic, Polydunami. :S
00,02then use computers to put better managment in place
I wonder where that coffee pot went - Ill just have to stir the grounds in the glass
phase4.... you kow what you should go up to telstra and tell them that
O_O Stay awake for days
00,02wow
00,02dat was a landing
Ninjazz, Rarity is sad http://tinyurl.com/7rmdx6y

Scootaloo: That is NAWT how you call a chicken :|
Dunno what to think of this http://fim.413chan.net/fim/src/129917575915-new-guy-Rarity.jpg

Going to the moon on THIS SONG, Phase4!? xD
Huh :D
04Polydunami...what are these Rarity dialogue things you keep showing?
Goodnight MahBoi777!
00,02XD
Wouldnt it be nice to see Celestia have one?
I was actually searching Rarity pics on the image search
/me hugs Ninjazz back
Phase4: perfect song.
04Ah
00,02i'm trying to land on the light side of kerbin
It's not just dialogue choices
04For a minute I thought you were making a flash game or something
I wish xD
00,02enough fuel to do so, why the hay not
lol fund it!
Ninjazz: You have the money? :D
No, it's probably already being made under our noses
i already have D N T
CrazyCherry: Yesh, i do. :3
i like using no script on top of those kinda addons heh
00,02problem is the atmosphere
not playing games for... 3 months straight and saving the money helps.
but you don't have D N T +
00,02meens i cant time warp
plus anything for a Rarity game. <3
so close...
also have this addon that allows googleapi's through a proxy only heh
A game where you could date Rarity, huh?
oo
>.>
been using this stuff for so long
<.<
That'd be...
lovely. :$
i wasn't aware youtube had advertisments till a few weeks ago
when i accidentally went on with opera
moving hastily along.
same
i agree xd
I love it when I accidentally pres resfresh....
What the heck?
the big blue button certainly tempts you, doesn't it?
i remember hearing about the youtube partnership program and how youtube pays people for ads on their videos and then i look and think "what ads?"
Phase4: Where are you?! Why is it so... golden?
lol ya
Indeed
What is this place?
00,02Ninjazz, ?
It can't be Kearth?

00,02well
i'm not an eevee now
00,02that worked well
that didn't... end well.
Im no expert, but thats probably not good
Phase4, where did you ultimately land?
00,02i might attempt this with mods for docking
00,02but dats later
judging by the explosions... probably not.
00,02Polydunami, eh, on land somewhere
00,02Ninjazz, no one died
hi everypony
Well, hank Celestia!
thank*
Kerbal Captain: O_o hope that wasnt important

Ninjazz I had to read that sentence 3 times before i undertsna dyou mean Australia with "down under"... "over down under" confused me very much XD

Or the "only for the quest" newspaper stand
Lil_B: ikr? I was kinda hoping he'd understood. luckily he did.

alexxm: I think in one I was dressed as a girl in an all boys school having tea with... the host of QI.
*british mode
I don't think so, Lil_B.
odd FairysHuff
Ninjazz would be helpful XD
smooth Phase4
/me is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
especially for Phase4's sake, Lil_B.
/me refuses charges
alexxm: Though I was obsessing the entire time with makeup to hide shaving shadow
Ninjazz thats the idea :)
FairysHuff: Weird, but not that weird.
Almost 5am, shoulld think about getting some shut eye soon.
i like the car carnage
Hey Lil_B, I'm watching the Videogames Awesome guys playing Lollipop Chainsaw! They SUUUUCK :D
Om: Oh there were weirder but I can't remember them after waking. Just vague images and feelings
wow, elevators, I thought they only had Paternoster
FairysHuff: I know how that goes.
MadSurgs if we're thinking of the same people isn't that the point
Lollipop Chainsaw! I saw that game while I was at Gamestop. I'm sad I didn't pick it up... T__T
MadSurge Fraser always sucks at Videogames XD
MadSurge if we're thinking of the same people isn't that the point
Just going to make myself some toast.
YEAH TOAST!
Phase4: 2 things...steal anything they didnt already take and goodnight...im tired as hell
Lil_B: he's taking it like DMC when it's more like No More Heroes :D
what is Lollipop Chainsaw? new game recently released?
bye Shamroc
00,02nighs Shamroc
Gnight, Shamroc. Sleep well.
04Yes, Cypress
nighty Shamroc
moop
04Night Shamroc
yep Cypresswolf tara strong voices the main character
Cypresswolf: One word. Tara Strong voiced the protagonist.
Cypresswolf: Made by Suda 51 and the protagonist is voiced by Tara Strong :D
04...that's five words
that's five... but you get what I mean.
yeah...
Nice! never heard of it though :D
Ninjazz cant count. I'll remember that.
;__;
Dat kick :D
who got kicked
I see, release 2 weeks ago
o.o
search her underwear drawer for clues
what in the world is going on?
word fail?
04But yeah, the real reason to pick Lollipop Chainsaw up is because Suda 51 made it
04That man is a genius
Cypresswolf: if you liked No More Heroes it's your game
I just had a 1-sec power outage...
A gay saddle 6_9
Indeed. And nothing to do with hearing Twilight Sparkle cut up hundreds of undead non-ponies.
Ghosties: Indeed :3
restarted my PC XD
04Yeah, it's a bit actiony
Havent played that game, MadSurge
04Personally, Killer7 is one of the best games I've ever played
!pokemon
!pokemon
Zapdos, you are a 12Crawdaunt.
liez
lol
04But it's probably the least known of his recent titles in the last 10 years...if you don't count Shadows of the Damned
04Not THAT'S a damn shame
/me yawns.
Ghosties: I did hear Shadows of the Damned was pretty good
Heard of Shadows. I was tempted to get it just for it's odd humor.
Ghosties: how's Shadows Of The Damned? Haven't tried that one
/me throws a blanket over CrazyCherry1
Ninjazz: Thanks.
Shadow of the Colossus?
CrazyCherry1: Anytime.
/me hugs CrazyCherry1
04Not Shadow of the Colossus, Shadows of the Damned
Akira Yamaoka <3
04And I haven't played it, though I want to
Mmkay.
/me hugs alexxm.
04However I did once own Shadow of the Colossus
So far only 2 clues....this is gonna be a wonderful case :D
Yeah, I'd like to play both Shadow games sometime in the future.
Heyo fellows
Man can make you shit your pants as good as he can rock your socks off <3
Hey there, SpringStingray.
hey SpringStingray hows your day been
It's been alright, a bit exhausted :p
I liked Shadow of the Colossus, some of those bosses were harder than hell tho /)_-;
Colossus is famous for it's... setting i think? and Damned is known for its craziness.
how come SoringStingray
L.A. Noir?
eyup.
I should gedt this some time :/
I have a complete Audio Rip of Lollipop Chainsaw, the music there was also made by Akira Yamaoka, but i didn't thought it was that spectacular :/
Look at her smug face
04Yamaoka composed the music for LP?
true
I failed :D
the face of a liar
Ghosties yes, ecept the licensed songs
damn...
Lollipop Chainsaw soundtrack is also available on iTunes for 9.99$ XD, Tracks 6Tracks are licensed Tracks, Track 7-15 are by Akira Yamaoka
04Oh, you mean like Riot Rhythm by Sleigh Bells
04Man, it's like that track was MADE just for LP
00,02so
00,02i still suck at this
nah, phase. You just need to read her face.
Phase4: you should use your Intiutions or how ever you spell it :P
She was looking pretty smug there
Should have cut her down :p
shoot her
Emotions weave a tale.
Pull out a gun, those loosen tongues pretty well
or yeah... shooting would work too.
Hello, miss. Tell me what you know. *holds at gun point*
Point a gun at her face and say "WHAT DO YOU KNOW BITCH?!"
I'm gonna go, I don't really want this ruined
lol, the door wentthrough the other guy
I am an ef bee aye agent!

Cya, SpringStingray. Take care.
Phase4: just shoot everything that moves

Ghosties: Still?!
04Yeah, it's like $30 used
damn storm woke me up...
Damn... it's been 2 years.
04If it was $20, I'd probably get it. If it was $30 new then I would get it
Ghosties: you should get The Walking Dead :P
00,02qwww
00,02awww'
and thats why the Doctor travels in a British Police box!
oops.. dang* i mean
00,02its making me drive

04Oh, wait, it is $30 new...maybe I was waiting for it to go down to $20?
brb, getting something to eat for breakfats (12:00am... Breakfast... >.<)
o_O
Ghosties: ive been only getting steam sales for $5 lately :P
Still, Ghosties, 20 - 30 doesn't sound so bad. I personally recommend it. It's one HELL of an experience!
LilB: I had breakfast at 7pm today xD
what the hell?
Om in your timezone? XD
Aye
that was out of nowhere
Never felt so stressed out to keep myself alive before in all my life of gaming.

Ghosties: eh?

I like how all these people think a murder is so cool
ALL the derps.
We are investigating a murder. "Oh wow! How can I help?"
Phase4: little tip, your looking for something in the bad :)
Go kill someone and turn yourself in.
They wanna be famous.
Phase4: *back

AH HA!
Om: Kicking down doors now.

I have a pain that feels like sunburn and has really sensitive skin on my stomach... it comes and goes...

i did not hit her its not true its bullshit i did not hit her... I DID NAAHT... ohai bronystate
No thet's just proff it's working. um there were a bunch of primary school language classes in the early 90's . We were being taught to speak in Moari at school
oooh and Party.mov is out too
dat pinkie pie
valoreins anyway how is your sex life?
asdfghjklöä''''
CrazyCherry1: something wrong?
hey valoreins hows your day been
Lil: i dont wanna talk about it
FairysHuff, which tribe?
Of course i buggered off to England when I was 10 and missed it
alexxm: tiring
04The Whale Rider was a movie that came out in recent years about a little girl from a part of the Maori that is destined to become a leader
Irish_Pony: No, just freaking out...
CrazyCherry1: why? :S
how come valoreins
Mutterguy: We had something similar here in Scotland. A resurgence of Gaelic language and culture.
Irish_Pony: For fun.
CrazyCherry1: Oh you :P
Rain: I don't know any tribes. I usually just go researching online and learn as I go.
Ghosties: Is it any good?
well Im part Creek
alexxm: i was hunting for a pony toy on my local town... i failed
Rain: Creek?
and Chocktaw (I never can spell this one)
and cherokie
Mutterguy: Strangely at the same time you mentioned. 90s
Toys R us for pony toys :P
Rain: Are you listing tribes or do you have all of those tribes part of you?
I have each of those tribes in my blood
yeah ther might have some relisation they were going all about it the wrong way. English being the only language taught because it's the onl one important enough to learn then they realised all these cultures were due to disappear...
valoreins were you looking for any in particaular
alexxm: i search low and high, high and low... all i found is G3 ponies..
Rain: Interesting, Thanks. I'll have a look at all of those. Starting with Creek.
^_^
Mutterguy: Yeh. The Gaelic resurgence is still going today.
valoreins don't really know where to suggest sorry
naaaaaah
Mutterguy: A tv show which teachs the Gaelic language has been going now for almost 20 years.
its alright im always like this
it's always hard for bronies living in a country that has little brony influence to find G4 toys

valoreins /]
It's interesting how despite all the many isolated cultures across the globe they STILL managed to invent the Bow and Arrow at roughly the same time in history O_o Weird huh
Hey FairysHuff!
MadSurge: Yo
your talking to ComraDerpy born in 1985..... prehistoric is before my diapers
FairysHuff: even the famous myrthical creatures like dragons
mythical*
G1 ponies
that's not very fun
DFO
*and G1 ponies
The old German for spear is Yari and the Japanese for spear is Yari O_o
Drake doesn't like it
or I'd play with him
I play with Telume instead
lol
>:
i never see telume talk
oh and even my Typography lecturer pointed out that most Sun God on most civilization has "Ra" in their name
Meanwhile: what's with gingers and everyone hating them .__.
really..
MadSurge: It's probably because they're evil.
they bdont have souls
Ra like Ray?
or ^^
idk. I feel the same way for the hatred of jews. Just why?
valoreins: Interesting.
cus' he's not a talker
Meanwhile: then why people like redheads so much .__.
I like Gingers ;)
Ra in Egyptian... Amate"RA"su in japan... i forgot the others
MadSurge: Because red isn't orange.
He lurks
doesn't he talk in the game?
Yes
He talks on IRC too
Liez
where
oh wait it's red heads I like. shit.
i want to see this
Meanwhile: it's still dumb :D
i've seen him do nothing but idle for over a year
MadSurge: Oh I agree.
Not on my net usually
00,02stream looks ok?
My meds are making me sleepy. Time for my nap. Back in a while.
Looks fine Phase4.
brb everypony
rubies
the one time i saw him active was when he quit with a message once
i never got a hi out of him
i was starting to think he was some dead bnc
Phase4: yes it does
or maybe not even a person
languagewise i wish i could learn latin (like they teach more of in sweden) and wish i could code
Nice nick ComraDerpy :D
i should play this game

He'll respond

idk if it's even a rule anymore
to ask before pm'ing
welp i'm downloading the game
going to take half a day to grab
lol
did the chat break ?
no , just really quiet
Nope. Just quiet
eyup
looks abit like
multiple games just mixed together
My chat is deeeeaaaaaad
i should hitchhike to everfree nw
Why am I so tired?
How long you been awake?
6 hours.
Did you sleep well last night?
Nope.
/me misses being on Linux
fml gaming requires windows
That's probably why then.
ya heh
I miss a lot of the stuff I had on linux
And I can't access my linux files from windows
and all my work and code is on linux
so literally the only thing I can do on windows is game
I had to drag over my xchat configs + pevents.conf file so I could use IRC
I hate xchat's default crap
04Whoa, only 82 people in here o_o
there's
Dat Ghosties.
ext2/3 drivers
04IT'S AN ALIEN INVASION
for windows
12so NS
there's also VMs
that run linux
12I heard you like coding
12:D
prometheus styleee
04I used to be a kid like you...then, I took a bullet to the parents
you shot your ma'am?
Und dann Batman.
prick~
Yeah but, my linux partition is ext4, not ext2/3
04MY MOM IS DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
and I don't want to install a VM
waste of resources
your choice
/me knocks on wood
doesn't really matter
only takes like 30 seconds to reboot into either OS
I suppose the chat died with Ghosties' parents
less, even
/me runs
though linux is being slow with the MBR record
-record
so linux takes longer to boot than windows
i'm baack
whats up guys and gals
is it ubuntu
/me scratches his face "I'll let that one slide since you probably didn't know my dad passed away in January...but refrain from the dead parents jokes directed at me from now on"
heh
...
and i bring with me Pringles chips
I am SO sorry
It's mint
hmm
which is a variant of ubuntu
XAX I'll tip mah hat to yah brah
ya
:(
And cinnamon, the desktop environment, is a battery nommer
04It's fine, XAX...just...don't do those jokes to me anymore
Jokes?
battery lasts less than an hour on linux
about 30-45 minutes
I like jokes!
A man walks into a bar. Ow.
on windows it lasts like 3-5 hours
lawl
not underclocking the cpu or anything
:D
I dunno
What did the farmer say when he lost his tractor?
CPU usage seems far too high
windows will underclock/undervolt the cpu using advanced power management
"Where's my tractor?"
/me why did the hipster burn his mouth
man who runs behind car gets exhausted
04A man walks into a bar. His alcoholism is destroying his family.
idk
depending on your cpu that is
he ate his pizza before it was cokl
I think it's an issue with linux rather than windows
and version of windows
/me loves "not jokes"
cool*
Anti joke Ghosties.
Windows 7
04Yeah, "not jokes" or anti jokes
04Love 'em
then it's slowing down your cpu and gpu to save power
when on the battery
I laughed too hard at that not joke
D;
Probably not an issue
04Like there is ZERO set up
At this stage
Two men walk into a bar. You'da thought one of them would've seen it.
04Just WHAM
lol thats a good one Ghosties
my processor is HT'd anyway
So 8 cores
Ghosties can you only have red text?
ah
sorta
lol
I'd rather have it underclocked than overclocked
Because linux is being a resource wh*re
04Well, yeah
Anyone can use color. You'll just get kicked instantly as soon as you do, is all.
04^
It only started with the newer version of mint
heh
04Users aren't allowed to use color
:( why?
oh
I was using 9 before on my old laptop
Which was still using GNOME 2
04Because only the mods may use color
04It's so users can tell who we are
Ghosties So you can't change your color?
use+`r' *facehoof*
04I can
But ever since I started using cinnamon because gnome 2 wasn't available, battery went whooooosh
04I don't want to, though
Because if everyone could use color at will, the chat would be a flamboyant rainbow of eye-rape
He can, but red is his signature colour.
lately when i'm messing with linux i'm not using a gui
but it could be my laptop
And what ghosties said.
04I've been 'red' since the very first BMN
Well
When I manage my servers
04And that was before I was even a mod
Ghosties Can i see orange?
I obviously use the command line
ya
user user user user use her
But for personal use, always GUI
The mods tend to use distinguishing colours among themselves for sake of ease.
ah
Is there orange text?
Mods + Phase4
Ghosties ok then
Also
04There is orange text, but I don't use it
I'm going in a programming competition in a few weeks
give it time and he will be a mod :P
Why?
And the IRCops, if they want to.
any prizes?
Yeah
money
04Though they are technically not supposed to ><
like how much
and scholarship
04"You've been taught you should really carry no less than 5 computers on you at all times, like a sensible person."
er
04NS, take notes.
it was $3000 or $6000, can't remember
04We politely ask them to refrain from using colors so that there is some semblance of order around here :)
Ghosties What's your fav. color?
infared cops. scary
What is this place, filled with so many questions
o_o
geez
i am curious
But it's a $3000 scholarship if you come top 6th with the prize money
Why would you ask a question about the number of questions?
sounds nice
04Favorite color? Any shade of white
ah
http://www.computing.unsw.edu.au/school-programs/progcomp/prizes.html
wat
04Black, gray, white, etc.
oh
$5000 first prize
I like orange
it's team, so it'd be around $1333 per person
o_o
04Have you been the guy I've seen around here lately with "orange" in their nicks?
:l
oh
But it'll be hard
And I've never done this sort of thing before
broooown :)
You hvae 2 hours to do 5 questions
have*
what do you have to make anyways
Ghosties .......maybe...
04Haha
http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~progcomp/pastcomps.php
lol cgi
Darkblondish. But it's shaved atm.
04Though, on a fun note, NC State's colors are red and white
http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~progcomp/pop.php?loc=2011opentasks#task5 is quite annoying
but 5 of those questions in 2 hours
that's insane
Was that guy bad?
04So you could kinda look at it like I'm flying the "team colors" but I actually don't care for NC State
you have like 25 minutes for each
240 minutes / 5
Speaking of nicknames, why does JRP always put a [insert word here] at the start of his name?
04Dunno
Is it so that he's at the top of the list? :l
04You'd have to ask him
Because that's what I'd think.
i see
about 28 minutes I think
Im not the orange guy but i am bronystate
Under the mods, of course.
dammit im going out again brb everypony
I cbf to properly calculate that
wow long load time for me
and even though it's team
Bye bye everypony!!
you only have one computer
bai
Bye CrazyCherry1.
abuse me more i like it..... >.>
+ the rest of my team aren't that competent
Wat.
but that's fine
/me slaps ComraDerpy around a bit with a large trout
wat
errrr..
your making up for it heh...
That default slap
Dat stock /me
I'm tempted to use mIRC and then just go *trollface*
sounds stressful
04What? He wanted abuse :o
or use whitespace but then I need to learn that
lol mirc
yeah lol mirc
processing power of mIRC is crap
Are you sure it's a he...
also lol VB
I'll probably end up using python or C
04....my god
I'm going to stay away from C++
04I dunno
ah
to make sure my brain doesn't die
04On the net, you always go by the rule that everyone is male
But the good thing about mIRC is that it's easy
XAX oh yeah i forgot
04That is for the people you don't know
04Like
so therefore I only need to think up the process part which is easy for me
04I know Luna is female
because mIRC's syntax is pretty logical
04I know Vivi is female
04And Shizuka too
though so is python's
How do you know?!?
Are you a SPY?
Skype
lift up the skirt?
Because they're mods. Mod chat.
oh ok
not even thinking about perl
I don't know perl
hey guys
04Huh...spy
i see
04Now that you mention it
Allo Unfound.
hey Chrysalis
I could use PHP too
lol
and Phase4 can confirm I'm male
but >PHP
04I did use to have that tag
it's a broken fork without mysql
12LOL I'm dumb
04Ghosties, a.k.a. The Red Spy
12I'm wondering why my code isn't working
12and I look at I wrote
12uisng namespace std;
12and I wrote*
'aint nobody ever needed confirmation that someone was male.
...lolfail
12|D
C or C++?
12C++
04No no
04Change your name back
lol
Ghosties Hello friend
lol
04We don't allow article nicks
>_>
04Or one letter nicks
Close enough.
lol article
O u meanwhile
04-_- Meanwhile
shouldn't be hard
04Anyways

Hah
04:I
Haha
04Fuck all y'all
D'aw.
:D
I hate working under time limits
sucks
that was weird...
12same

Everypony is a meany pants.

that is insane
04Get your stinkin' paws offa me!
12yeah
hmm, anyone else unable to get on ponyfortress2.com
lol
:(
04(you damn, dirty ape!)
Ghosties It's ok have a doughnut /me gives Ghosties his best doughnut

>_>
00,02stupid map

laswl
lawl
fail
DUMB MAP

/me glomps Ghosties
04-__________________________-
If Ghosties and Val hugged the universe would implode.
^
nothing was said of glomps, technically in the right!
00,02Meanwhile, WE MUST TEST THIS
04Phase using dat crew leverage
00,02FOR SCIENCE
00,02Ghosties, 6_9
who are those people?
Kerbal space derpage.
04There is no way Val and I would ever hug
00,02i was given a key for smite
00,02lets try it
Astronauts?
Without being drunk
04Do you really want the destruction of all matter?
PSO2 has some interesting boob physics(very broken physics)
00,02dey are kerbanauts
Kinda, yeah. :I
04Are you that mad?!
Ghosties: yesh
Just a smidgeon.
actually that's destruction of space.
Pyroland is best land
04Well, tough luck. It ain't happenin'
the matter will be stll be there
Ghosties Can i ask you a question?
Inb4 no.
Ghosties doesnt like hugs?
cmon, just a tiny bit of annihilation Ghosties ?
00,02nvm
/me hugs Ghosties
04-_-
XAX -_-
00,02thiats still bugged out horribad
04NO ANNIHILATION
Ghosties Do you have a boss or manager?
04ANNIHILATION IS EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN
._.
What?
Ghosties: What is the air velocity of an unladen swallow?
awww
.-.
that important question
04Do I have a boss?
Meanwhile: A duck
inb4 IM THE BOSS
Ghosties yeah
04You mean, like, is there anybody on the team that's above me?
Irish_Pony: ...what.
Meanwhile: it has the wing speed velocity of a duck :P
Ghosties Do you have a leader or something?
04On the team?
Irish_Pony: That's...no.
Ghosties Yeah
Meanwhile: Im choking on laughter at your extremely important question.
04If I do have a boss it would be you guys.
:o
Ghosties: Oh sweet, get me a cup of tea.
/me is Ghosties boss? :O
Ghosties: really? then...GET BACK TO WORK!!!
/me is a baws
:D
nice kick
dat kick
04What I mean is that I'm here for you guys
i will be a cool boss
Ghosties is here for me? :O
04BronyState was made to give to the fans
Rain: No one is here for you.
darn
Rain course, Ghosties is a cool guy
Wait wait wait.....
Ghosties: and to bring together this community better :P
Heya everypony.
/me hugs Rain.
g'day EggWhite
04I would love to see the community get better, definitely
^
04I'll do whatever I can to see that happen
I'm feeling the need for tea now. Gonna go do something about that.
Ghosties What will happen to bronystate after the show ends?
thats a good question
04Then...I guess BronyState will either die or we'll do something else
is there a need for anything to change?
it will stay a place to hang out and watch movies like it started as?
haul on that black shit in the karrafe
I guess it can stay how it is.
other than no new eps
Ghosties: then shall I recomend that those with an OC be part of a large banner?
nothing else should have to change
Rain: You stole exactly what I was about to say
04It's a question I've struggled with for a while, but Chrysalis is pretty much right; the only thing that would probably change, immediately at least, is that we wouldn't be showing anymore new pony eps
The sonic fandom still exists and sonic's been dead for like 10 years.
04UNLESS
Phase4, that thing looks like it is going to fall apart
We can watch Wrek draw more ponies
04BronyState actually stays around long enough to show whatever the next incarnation of MLP is
00,02Rain, i'm suprised it hasnt
good sonic has been dead...sonic is still around
Once the show as finished, BronyState will go on as normal with movie nights and random streams...hopefully
It flys! :O
lol, inb4 bronystate is renamed fauststate
00,02Ghosties, this is where i'd hug you
What do you guys think the next gen ponies would be like?
04Why you huggin' me, bro?
Chrysalis: why Fauststate?
but seriously, The fandom will disappear after 9 years. Poor Gargoyles fandom
Wrek has already created gen 5
lawl that would be awsome
pretty sure Bronystate will die if I ever become a mod
lets just focus on curent gen and hope for the best
04inb4 4.5, CMC stars in it
"Dont hug me bro! dont hug me! AAarrghh AAAAA"
00,02Ghosties, that would be awesome actually
04Yeah, I'd like that too
i can't stand the cmc
It wouldn't be bad.
00,02Chrysalis, :<
/me loves the CMC
and half of the bg ponies are OC ponies
04Those guys rule
:o
why Chrysalis???? WHY???
If you guys had the chance to name the next mane 6 what would you guys name them?
Ghosties: lol.
if they actually kept continuity that would be nice, but doubtful
Scootaloo is the best CMC
/me begs to differ
So I went downstairs to boil the kettle and my sister slapped me in the face with a corn on the cob while shouting "Gotta keep my pimp corn strong"
04...your sister
WHAT
Sometimes it's just one of those days.
04...she is awesome
wtf
lawl
bloomy and sweetie are cutie but scoot da shizzle
she is as awesome as she is /without/ any back story. imagine how she will be once she does have back story
04Tell your sister that a moderator from BronyState thinks that she is awesome, Meanwhile
I'll let her know.
at least she didnt stick it anywhere
DeadpoolDash: >_>
wai what?
Meanwhile, your sister just won 3 weeks worth of internets
just saiyan
04LIEK IN HIS MOUTH TO EAT?
^
Scootaloo is best CMC
^^
/me is back (gone 01:50:37)
unrealistically we'll turn into a international cult that sets out to collect tithes from indvidual memeers so that one day we'll be able to liberate Equestria from the the great betrayer Hasbro. We'll then all congregate in and take over Leichenstein and Build the City state of Canterlot /toomuchCiv
...the other place
What.
Mutterguy, wait...were not alreay a cult?
04Careful, Deadpool
How many ponys do you see riding a fucking SCOOTER
not formally
lol.
what the hell am i gonna do with all this kool aid?!
04Man, Ponychan freaked out when they found out there was a FiM cult page on wikipedia
wtf steam, i DELETED the tf2 folder, and all files successfullly validated?

NOBODY's TALKING. ONLY PHASE4 HAS VOICE
/me runs
04Such as a lentil, or a turnip
00,02XAX, D:

Und dann Ghosties was a turnip.

he really likes kerbal O_O
hmmm
mishia, you really like ponies

All of us really like ponies :3
Funnily enough it's been raining too much to wear flip flops.
Rain: Tomorrow is in 15 minutes for me :D

:D
XAX oh it is too

they always break
d3rb I think i did....
d3rb: That's why I barely rewatch actual episodes. So that when I do, they're awesome.
I liked Sumica's flight this morning that span so fast it shattered.

Meanwhile: And storm chasers.

feline publishes cbbbbb to Internet
Aww, I like you Rain.

Ghosties: my cat outside likes the rain :P
Irish_Pony: D:<
Even if you did prevent me from mowing the lawn today.

Irish_Pony: Poor cat lol
/me will visit Ghosties at night time then :3c
XAX: she doesnt mind, besides we take good care of her

Rain: 5 way?!
>_>
<_<

04It is a kickable offense
Why?
otakon x shipping.

04Hey now, we don't take kindly to teh mod shippinz

Goodbye world!

How did the whole otakon being shipped with everything start.
Bronystate x Bronystate :P
I can't remember.
he gets really upset by it, XAX
and people find it funny
Who gets upset?
/me presents the final result on the table
Mostly because it /is/ funny.
/me does the John Cena hand face thing
dun dun dun 24 mini ponies + 6 brushies = awesome
so basically trolling
/me can see Ghosties
and 2 plushies
otakon when he's mad sounds like Nova in his rage vids.
TADA Chocolate Rain! (That so was not worth the set up)
Meanwhile: omgreally?
um, Phase4, why are they all pinned to plywood?
00,02Rain, why not
Phase4: go into space with it :D
doesnt seem very... safe
Rain budget cuts
here ghosties http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/307/430/7eb.gif
and obama
Phase4: Because plywood is seriously underpar compared to nearly any kind of metal?
brb /msg'ing myself
Rain: since when does this game seem safe?
O_O
Actually that's a good point.
00,02Meanwhile, well the suites protect them from space
Also wood explodes in space. </factsphere>
00,02why use a command module at all?
Phase4: Suites? They in a hotel?
but, Phase4, their suits dont hold much air
XD
00,02Rain, they can hold their breath
This is the impending-death suite.
XXXXXXXXXDDDDDD

If I'm lucky, I may end up calling it a day after all my safety meetings are done
they look like someone who doesnt like AJ walldives...still no aj emote
I just hope I can fake not sounding like a zombie through them all
00,02i wants to hear those songs :/
safety meetings Cypresswolf ?
00,02allso restarting stream
WallDives: I got a page full of pony smilies - And AJ is among them :) http://www.friendshipismagic.org/forum/misc.php?do=getsmilies&editorid=dbtech_vbshout_editor13
I'm cool.
Cypresswolf, that aj sleepy needs to be here
d3rb: yeah, Usually every wednesday - Im a safety inspector for an electrical contractor company, outside of deliveries I make periodic checks to jobsite to make sure everyone is wearing their gear & following safety standards
awesome
Might get back here early in the afternoon, depending on how late I go...maybe a bit after 8
00,02woah
00,02lag
00,02epic lag
00,02fast rocket though
far out
00,02this should not work
me thinks it might cook itself
Phase4: surprise, it does :D
00,02theres some overheat warnings
week is already thrown off - Jury duty tomorrow & not sure if working wednesday - July 4th
00,02might still not work perfectly
ugh jury duty, never done it but it sounds BORING
00,02the altimiter has given up
"figure it out yourself"
whee at work
Phase4: Lower graphic setting?
orly
http://i.imgur.com/PeoNg.jpg
00,02Vordox, there are no options
00,02i think its jsut bugged out
its much like the lotto here, completely random on who gets chosen, you get to the court house and wait there til about 9am, then they call out random numbers between x & x and if you have that number they to you to a room with tape boxes on the floor
00,02run out please
00,02games gona lag untill those things run out
time to overclock that laptop
04Don't you get paid to do jury duty?
o shit. Moonrise Kingdom is finally at my town.
seperating you further, x amount of people in each box, then you go to a certain court and sit before a judge to listen what the case will be about. They ask you question to figure out pre knowledge or bias toward the case and pick the best 12 out of the group, best to have a higher number at that point
sounds really boring Cypresswolf
I've been summoned twice before - 50% I had to sit on the panel - waste of time in my opinion - loose out on a full days wage for $6 :|
Ghosties: i believe they recompensate you for your gas money
$6....
if its more than 1 day, each consecutive day after is $40
04...six dollars total or six dollars an hour?
oh cause $40 is sooo much better :D
6 total
not even enough for McDonalds
ok back
LOL
Just noticed EQD banner got changed to Burnycon
XD
<But you get to serve your community> the ones in court arent the ones I want to serve
00,02another case of "i screwed things up horribly but its worked out anyway
yeah they shoulkd have made the effort to avoid being in court
Isn't that every case?
00,02i cant actually land this thing
the one I was in the panel was about a contract for a bail bondsman - adn the 2nd was about an auto accident
00,02um
00,02huh
00,02not sure what to do here
reverse park Phase4
00,02-_-
:) If it's about drugs, would I be chosen if I were to say a buddy of mine was imprisoned for possesion and think they're all guilty?
I wont, just asking
no idea
:P some of my co workers suggested I act a jerk
like on money issues - they're greedy so & so's! :|
All I have to do is claim the criminal justice system is racially biased.
00,02so
00,02i'm in orbit around mun
just rock up with a swastika tshirt, they'll tell you not to worry about it and go home, no time wasted then
why mun btw, is the term moon copyrighted by nasa or something :)
00,02XD
That or just go in looking dingy, torn jeans, offensive shirt, smell bad, cuss alot...
00,02shana, nah, its just cause
turn up half pissed with a bottle of jd in hand
04Wow, you guys are still talking about this :P
Phase4: You're not going to meet Luna like that...
12!chatstats
Loading stats program...
00,02User0, i cant land
whiskey on the breate :) get turned away at the door
00,02not sure what to do right now
Phase4: crash? like always?
00,02i'd rather avoid that
dude, just slowly back it up, like your parking a trailer
12the?
00,02not enough fule to correct my orbit for minmus
00,02fuel'
00,02enought to get back to kerbin
I might just go sleep deprived another night and be even more agitated & crankier than I am now
00,02probably not enough to land, not with this mcuh weight
i dont know then, try skim it across the surface of the moon and hope for the best?
00,02allso cause of a fuel bug, i would not be able to controll a landing
Phase4: You can't avoid fate, the fate of the 'splosion.
what?
00,02d3rb, i could orbit lower than the highest peaks but thats slow
lol did it die?
00,02and boring
oh
12is the program slow, or have I overworked it?
00,02looks cool though
nah
TST is down
00,02User0, wana bet?
it can't upload it
heh
12oh, why?
switching hosts
Phase4: I will be very impressed if you can actually get it to land without 'splosions.
:) I know whatll pick me up - John Denver ^_^
no
00,02i'ma transfer back to kerbin
00,02User0, i cant
00,02its litteraly too heacy
00,02heavy'
more like a fight between the hoster and arti i think
00,02the engine i'd land on WILL explode
Phase4: exactly, that's why I would be very impressed.
12oh
Itll only last long enough to get me out the door, the first person that cuts me off in traffic will just end my happy
00,02fair enough
SOPA didn't pass in the US
though TPP did
heh
idk when that takes effect or what it will limit
Phase4: but what fun is kerbals without 'splosions?
00,02i forgot how orbits work
12yeah, hopefully, it won´t kill our all connections, you know, they´re even setting up a spying programm on it
*sings along to Back Home Again* :)
let them spy on me
d3rb moo

The chorus " Hey Its good to be back home again. Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend" AJ coming back from Manehatten after tiring of her Orange relative

You're at 1000 something now Phase4 ...Good luck
00,02yeah
00,02the altimiter went away
How do the strings work on that? they're kinda going through each other...
I'm using double encryption
xD
LAWL
Dat uber landing
00,02i like hwo the lower portions of the craft form a crumple zone
SSL connection to my home laptop which connects to my bouncer with ssl and that connects to this server with ssl
:s
Phase4: I'm impressed that you didn't have casualties, but there were 'splosions. Best of both worlds!
i just proxy
phase a VERY expensive crumple zone
00,02anyone here know how to configure a tf2 srever?
on open wifi connections that aren't my own
anyways
was about to say shizu, but shes offline
00,02i think she uses the one intergrated into tf2
00,02not the dedicated one
Phase4: for which OS?
00,02linux
00,02servers running, just need to configure
ah ok
00,02spesificly how do i make it listen on something other than the loopback
12oh btw, my comp´s starting to bluescreen now
use a VGA driver?
Phase4 there is a dedicated program you have to download i believe
wow, only 90 people in the chat Oo
Use something that doesn't bluescreen?
yeah
00,02Chrysalis, its downloaded
Like a mac?
Source Multiplayer Dedicated Server""
lololol
let me point out the obvious and say that more duct tape is needed
INB4 Beedian
You know, you only get kernel panics
00,02little more fiddly with linux, but that bits done
User0 and Gum
or
00,02User0, ikr
or those white glitchy screens
xorg crashes
or
Phase4 http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Windows_dedicated_server
Xorg fails
module fails
:v
See HML
and sometimes
or http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Linux_dedicated_server
Phase4: hm are you sure it listens only on loopback and not on wildcard :/
yes do that one
Phase4: otherwise -ip parameter
i've seen mac os 9 crash so idk where this myth that macs don't crash comes from
Xorg or cinnamon freezes/crashes
if I move my mouse
this laptop crashes without a kernel panic :|
while it's logging it
the entire hardware is borked
wow
in*
I use fingerprint login
much quicker
No, I mean
the fact less ppl own a mac then a windows pc i guess
00,02shana, i'm sure
now launch
00,02oooo
00,02shana, -ip seems to have worked
Phase4: the info is from https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Command_Line_Options
00,02shana, thx
00,02launch this then i'ma try the server
best rocket design ever <3
Phase4 ... how is this even working?
00,02this is working well
00,02Lil, i have no idea
You did lose one piece off the end of one of those rockets...
Phase4: you should be recording this :D
00,02Irish_Pony, might be, not sure
That is a really cool smoke pattern
Phase4: cmon this is totally bad ass!
00,02well damn
HIYA everypony
oh dear

00,02the chutes fell off
/me glomps Phase4

00,02why can i not connect
00,02shana, yeah
00,02its 192.168.1.51
Phase4 just to check, try connecting to localhost
less then 2 weeks
00,02i'm 192.168.1.50
darn...more waiting :| July 16 cant come fast enough - I want my Derpy Hooves
Phase4: firewall comes to mind... do you have some iptables rules or somethiing?
00,02shana, turned that off
is that archlinux?
00,02ports open
00,02shana, yup
00,02i can connect via telnet
hmm well that only shows that tcp is working ^_^
ok, this Dubstep is a little bit to massive for me XD
00,02isnt windows suposed to have a telnet client built in
http://darklegacycomics.com/344.html
Phase4: they removed it from the default installation in vista
00,02:<
Phase4: you can install it via software additional stuff...
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4832/ - I absolutely have to go to work sleepy or not
00,02they hide it in the windows features on off thing usualy
yeah that
00,02may take a few minutes
Pinkielicious is awesome
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2878/ - me aprox 3 hours from now :)
going to work sleepy, i know that feeling Cypresswolf
00,02my brain is starting to derp
Phase4: tcpdump for linux, wireshark for windows/linux very useful in network debugging ^_^
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3811/ :) More like this really
This morning was tough for me to get out of bed too...
00,02shana, my fave tools :3
00,02ettercap too, for remote cap's
00,02think its ittercap
00,02s/i/e/
ettercap is good for mitm attacks ^_^
00,02yeah, i can connect
Phase4: note that telnet is tcp only
I doubt its a firewall issue in a lan but you never know..
00,02shana, yeah, but nothing should block udp betwene me and my shed
Good morning guys, sup?
yeah agreed
did everybody enjoy the bronycon stream
morning, everypony! :) How are we all today?
howdy, DarkStar!
00,02strange

Hi Sylandest
hi Sylandest :3
i know i enjoyed being the the after party was fun
there
spitfirecolt2: my power dropped for part of saturday and I had some friends over on sunday since they're power is still out...
howdy, Lil_B! :)
00,02it is using that port
00,02but its sending udp
i was next to the fire we had
is that chrystian Dubstep?
chistian*
looked like we bronys brought the house down
00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk7xH-a3O9k
00,02aparently it is
00,02thats new
alexi S*
00,02well
00,02i has no clue
00,02shana, any more ideas?
Phase4: serverflip?
Phase4: try a tcpdump on the linux box to see if udp packets arrive
Phase4: tcpdump -i interface -vvvv port $tf2port
(e.g -i eth0 or something)
CRACKLE IS BEST DRAGON
Phase4: not sure if ettercap is good for udp..
00,02shana, it'll do raw caps
00,02i doubt its betwene me and that machine though
00,02i play on other servers
00,02shana, ettercap -w [file] -D works nicely
ok
take it easy everypony :P
00,02i can see them
I return from nap
Phase4: nice
00,02so
Phase4: no reply as it seems?
00,02all this tells us is that the server isnt working
Phase4: can you do a iptables-save on the server?
server for what?
DeadpoolDash: TF2
00,02shana, i dont see why
what is the IP?
00,02packets are getting there, no respponse
Phase4: well a raw capture also shows packets dropped by the kernel
Phase4: so if you have an iptables rule to drop packets, they will still show in a dump
00,02theres no reply
Hi everyone
:)
Uh
What are we watching
howdy, TheJKLM
00,02shana, no rules
Oh I see my chat
Phase4: When you have time would you be able to show me how to get bronystate running on my android tablet with firfox?
00,02FairysHuff, it should just work
Phase4: hmm so I guess the server really does get the packets oO
00,02FairysHuff, need to install flash obviously
howdy, FairysHuff!
CRACKLE is best dragon
/me glomps FairysHuff
Phase4: sadly doesn't. I have flash installed but firefox keeps telling me to install it. weid
trogdor is best dragon
/me is back (gone 02:36:49)
00,02FairysHuff, try in the android browser
Bronysith: Sylandest *cuddles*
Phase4: oki
/me cuddles FairysHuff back :)
Dan's Dream is so good
00,02unless
00,02its listening on 27005 27015 27020
does that matter?
00,02just checking that it is actually listening
Having problems with my nick. Lost net connection for a moment and now can't get back in with my proper nickname
Phase4: you can do a strace to check if the process itself is reading the packets from the socket
Network: IP 192.168.1.100, mode MP, dedicated No, ports 27015 SV / 27005 CL Bad server address (192.168.1.51)
00,02lol
00,02DeadpoolDash, wont work yet
just thought I would post that if it helps
00,02its doing something
00,02many many futex calls
DeadpoolDash: 192.168.*.* are local addresses
Phase4: you can filter it out by specifying strace -e read
Phase4: that way you only get the read syscalls
00,02shana, yeah, just not sure which syscalls i want
Phase4: read/write are relevant
00,02hmm

shit just got real guys: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gk8-0cvImGA/T_D3DEgumnI/AAAAAAAAu68/m6cS37WaF9U/s1600/season3hype.jpg
Phase4: hm if a process forks you have to use -f so the forks are traced as well..
weird it works on android browser but not firefox
00,02shana, i've added -f
Ello everypony!
Ok now that I know that it works can someone show me how I get my nick back O_o
00,02FairysHuff1, your nick isnt registered so theres no way
00,02unless you meen changing
00,02thats /nick
ohai Malavolent
/me glomps Malavolent
Phase4: Thanks ^_^ I lost connection for a bit when I turned on my router. When I refreshed this page I couldn't get back in with my normal nick.
Wow, how convenient I come on to TF2. I have it downloading right now and wanted to watch some gameplay so I'm not completely useless when I start playing.
Why thank you, Bronysith .
00,02Braviary, i'll put some gameplay up then
Braviary: nobody cares in TF2 - expect to die a lot but don't worry if you aren't doing well
00,02this server is just not going to wrok
00,02work'
Oh, you will? Thank you very much!
00,02Braviary, its a thinking game
Phase4: it's probably something stupid&simple ^_^
Phase4: How do I go about registering my nick btw?
00,02shana, is it every anything else?
Braviary: (unless you're doing clan scrims and whatnot, but you don't need to worry about that stuff if you're new)
00,02FairysHuff, /ns help
Phase4: I SWEAR sometimes it's cosmic radiation!!!
everyone in TF2 are noobs
REGISTER FairysHuff
That'll make things easier for me, DeadpoolDash.
00,02shana, perhaps its cause i didnt choose a map
00,02it did different things when i did
00,02ah well
00,02problem for later
Braviary/DeadpoolDash: more like 50% are poor, 40% are okay, and 10% are good
00,02Braviary, its stratergy and ad-hoc teamwork
they all die the same
and the 10% are good because they do try to work as a team...
00,02huh
objectives are more inportant then K/D ratio
00,02one sec
important
Phase4: you could try using rcon?
00,02shana, i'll try all that later
I die alot cause I always keep pressure on the point
DeadpoolDash: fav class?
engi
00,02godadmnit
Phase4: kk, please tell me how you fixed it if you manage to ^_^
00,02so used to having an equalizer and direct hit
00,02shana, will do
thanks!
00,02that guy would not die
Phase4: more blowback!
00,02no wonder
04Man, the music in Donkey Kong Country Returns is good
Ghosties: yes
Ghosties: yes it is
04Poppin' Planks' music is excellent, FYI
00,02Braviary, you here?
Yes.
/me growls
00,02just checking
Phase4: Thanks for the help btw. Just registered
00,02FairysHuff, ^_^
now I'm joining the TF2 server :)
Phase4: I plan to reg a nickname once I figure out what my long-term name will be...
Phase4: And now I can use my android tablet as well ^_^ Though still weird how I can't use firefox to access bronstate on android. *SHrugs* Ah well. So long as it works.
Ghosties I have a full audio Rip (and the offizial Returns OST CD XD) I can upload it for you if you want
User0: MrSpaceButterfly
FairysHuff: I have a few that I'm throwing around, but I'm not 100% sure on any of them yet..
00,02User0, you can have multiple nicks registered
FairysHuff: which tablet do you have?
00,02i'm not a very good demoman
Phase4: I know, but If I want an original name, I don't want to be fighting someone else for it...
shana: The ASUS TF201 Transformer Prime. Wifi only model.
i got to play pony cart and mlp online it was fun
FairysHuff: looks neat
00,02User0, doubt you'll be fighting anyone for User0
04<Lil_B> Ghosties I have a full audio Rip (and the offizial Returns OST CD XD) I can upload it for you if you want <-- Oh, thanks Lil_B, but I'm okay
I'm waiting for an old style MLP Jrpg ^_^
shana: It's Extremely good and powerful.
Phase4: bring up the fps with the dev console command net_graph 1
Phase4: Well, "User0" is the first user of a system - there is actually a chance that people could have taken it...
00,02dats useful
00,02User0, eh, dont worry so much
Ghosties sry, I always get a little exited when I hear something about VGM XD
User0: I could give you one of my old names I don't use.
FairysHuff: an old style MLP Jrpg would be fun
Lil_B: SNARF
Sylandest: Very much so. Hope someone makes one.
FairysHuff: Nah, don't worry about it
FairysHuff: with the creativity this community has, we'll have it within a year, hehehe
shana: I have the model that comes with the keyboard dock.
MadSurge how much VGA did you watch :)
phase4 when i stream i get 200 fps constant
User0: Oki doki
00,02lucky
FairysHuff: Loki
00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, i'm on a laptop with optimus so limited by the internal gpu
Phase4: and thats on maxed out settings
User0: Pig in a poki
00,02i'ma change server
00,02bad server that one
my laptop gets 100 fps constant
Lil_B: they're at the old church, almost at Lewis Legend
Phase4: i killed you once
00,02Bronysith, lol, probably
00,02wasnt doing so well
00,02hmmm, upward
Phase4: doesnt matter. it is fun
00,02dont play on this a lot
afk, playing TF2 now
Lil_B: I still can't believe how bad he is, he makes the game look much less fun than it is :D
00,02Bronysith, true
I'd join Phase4, but I'm not in the best terms with my parents right now, and I'm at work...
MadSurge that's our FrashFrash XD
FairysHuff: very nice, have you considered dual booting another OS like ubuntu?
"that slaps me on the" - Ded...
Lil_B: you mean FRAGE, SNARF :D
MrPoniator i know you hid my sandvich somewhere
?
it's in your fridge
what
Under the rotten cheese
it cant be
shana: No. Too many things could go wrong. And it's still under warranty.
Hello everypony
shana: Maybe once warranty is up
wait wasnt...
FairysHuff: yeah could be hackish, altough it may be possible to boot from usb stick/sd card
MrPoniator lies ... you better not have given it to someoone else
shana: I mostly use it to remind myself of appointments, tasks and when to take meds and to eat ^_^
It's there under the rotten cheese
show me a pic
I just saw Princess_Luna? :S
i dont see it
I did too
Because only rotten cheese could block out the scent of your rotten sandvich
ok, my internet connection is to bad right now XD
shana: I'm actually trying to find a way to get a 3g or 4g Dongle to work with it.
shana: Tis not easy.
telstra + 4g BAH WHAT A FUCKING GARBAGE
spy!
its like like that mindless bitch that runs my contury
JRP2234[Silly_Filly]: Huh?
Phase4: mind I have the direct connect?
Would it violate the ToS if I responded by saying "at least you don't have a Negro?"
i no how to make you argue
dubstep
00,02Vordox, the what now?
I swear Luna was just on
Breasts
My server is down so I cannot see any community, so no friend join
Need a direct IP or server or anything that links I can use to join
DarkStar: Luna was, but then vanished
DarkStar: was only for a few seconds
00,02SOO MANY ROCKETS
DarkStar: I think Princess_Luna and the admin @Luna are 2 different people... (I could be wrong)
Well that sucks
00,02ALL OF THEM MISSED
Which server are you playing on?
I ment Princess_Luna
aye, thats who I meant as well
Vordox: Just stalk him, you know his username...
User0: I repeat, steam server is DOWN
FairysHuff: yeah if it's not supported out-of-the-box you may have to root it, I guess?
I cannot stalk him. =P
So need a direct IP or something so I can join the specific srever.
Vordox: Well excuse me for being at work and not being able to check.
User0: I have him on my friends list, but steam server is down means I cannot find it.
User0: What's that have to do with work? O.o
shana: Seems according to my research that using a smartphone as a 3g router for my android tablet is the easiest way. But a smartphone is a lot of money just to use it for 3g.
Vordox: Guess where I am...
User0: And that has got to do with TF2 and Phase...how?
shana: Also battery power for smartphones suck
Vordox: I didn't know the servers are down, and I can't really check
FairysHuff: something like mifi might be a better alternative
shana: mifi?
ipad is reallly good battry life
2 hours and still 100%
User0: but the first thing I said was that steam server was down. YOu must've missed it since you are working
Sorry everypony, for some reason it wont let me use my actual name
Phase4: Mind I get an IP or name on server or anything?
Wait, never mind
00,02Princess-Luna, Luna is a registered nick
00,02Vordox, dont you have me on steam?
Welcome back Princess
Phase4: Steam server is down
00,02wait what
Phase4: I have no community information
Princess-Luna: wait, are you the Princess Luna I remember?
00,02Vordox, i can see other peoples info here
YOu want me to go through every single server? XD
/me glomps DarkStar
Hey Sith
Your name does sound familiar Sylandest
how are you holding up DarkStar ?
00,02Braviary, and now you get to see the other big part of tf2
Im good, you?
I do? :O
DarkStar: fine
FairysHuff: correct!
00,02waiting for custom maps/sounds/models/cupcakes to download
Phase4: So what's hte name for server? :)
shana: Love that anime ^_^
shana: Yuuuuuujiiiii!!!
00,02Vordox, ponyfortress filidephia or something like that
FairysHuff: hurosai no baka!
Ok
FairysHuff: which anime?
00,02Vordox, just join the game i'm in
Princess-Luna: You're the princess luna who went away for a time because they got deployed (not sure if right word) right?
No, thats not me
00,02Braviary, but yeah, theres a lot of custom modes/maps for tf2
00,02makes the game that much more interesting
I've been at work for 1.5 hours, but I've got about 1 minute worth of work done... darn you Bronystate (I love you guys)...
FairysHuff: (aka my first non mainstream anime)
Princess-Luna: Ahhh, I see. my apologies for the mis-identification :$
/me 00,02hugs User0

Floris, I love you for bringing my attention to that video.
http://www.dorkly.com/article/35722/gaming-then-now
Bronysith: well played.
i agree with it completely
specially the getting immersed in a game bit
http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/blockbuster-buster/blockbuster-buster/35783-top-10-asinine-avatar-moments <-- AAAAAAARGH so much TRUTH IT HURTS my BRAIN
now it is just about searching desperately for memes within games
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srw2UDTbZXk&feature=g-all-u
Bronysith: That is why I loved Darksouls - it was a game made to be tough and kinda resembled the the learning curves of old games
User0: eeeeyup. and the false gamers could not play it
false gamers cannot play dark souls
^
love Dark Souls.
WallDives: im playing the pc version once it is ported
Bronysith: While I didn't beat it myself, I played it for a while and watched my bro play it (and my bro took my 360 when he moved... I really don't mind, but I can't play it for the time being)
User0: yea
Bronysith: Ever played Nethack, ADoM, or Dwarf Fortress?
User0: nope. i only really play games by valve nowadays
User0: you know. cause they actually deliver high quality games
and gabe newell is a brony
Nethack was originally released in 1987.
really?
Alright. I need to fix my X-Chat so that it can open links in Firefox.
Bronysith: I don't know when the last update was, hold on...
time to get my retro gaming on
aka super mario bros
Bronysith: I think the last release was 2009...
wait no, 2003... the website is newer than the last release...
sad that the rougelike genre doesn't get more attention :(
Mine loaded. I'll go try out the tutorials. Thanks for keeping me company this morning, everyone.

I can't quite watch the video since that'd be a tad bit too distracting
John De Lancie can rap if he wanted: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEL8FpYvLJ0&feature=channel&list=UL

Moeration is the key.
Moderation

Everlasting_Joy: It takes a LOT for something to get stale for me...
Moderation whats dat?
Moderation: taking things in small doses
User0: Lucky.
Or what Sumica might do if you act up
A little "moderation,"
Everlasting_Joy: I've listened to a single song all day before....
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsoxAG6wbIs&feature=relmfu So I heard you guys go HRNNRNRG for Fluttershy?
User0: As have I.
Everlasting_Joy: Things just don't get boring to me
User0: Again, lucky. Lately (very lately), it seems things grow so stale for me so fast. Now, does this mean I abandon it completely and henceforth? No, but I hate it.
I made poop. It was good.

CK|Catnap: i'm searching for it
08,01Biglaw: too busy to stream, sorry

Also Can someone explain to me what this Turnabout storm people were going on about a few days ago?
http://derpy.me/NlxY4
I did enjoy quite a few parts of Anthology 2.
I dont play Pheonix Wright so I have no idea what the fuck it is
Silly, I just linked it. :P
Well, I don't know everything about it (I also don't play the games) but the original name is Gyakuten Saiban which literally translated means Turnabout Court.
Maybe Sumic should slaughter more kerbals
I finished reading it a minute or so ago, checking out the comments now. They're actually pretty tame.
I guess Wrek isn't here?
Kandarihu: Shame its sequal got cancled because of whiners
Biglaw, he's on vacation.
for some reason kerbal space program wony work
ah, okay
on mine
wont*
Oh the voice acting is weird, BITCH ABOUT IT LIKE FAGS
Geh.. this is why we cant have nice things...
it just loads and shows the logo and doesnt do anything else
Sumica was doing some awesome stuff with his rocket jet of destruction yesterday
The voice acting? Seriously? :|
08,01my god, i am tired
08,0172 hours with very little sleep
Uh, I am SO BORED
MegaMoonShine: no joke the turnabout storm sequal got canned BECAUSE OF VOICE ACTOR COMPLAINTS

Very_Silly_Filly: Now do that floor drag sweetie belle did
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3667/ This is the chat right now
CCCP: artist?
Spade-Magnes[R]: story of my life....
Mic: I didn't draw that! lol
CCCP: Who did?
Spade-Magnes[R]: well excuuuse me! i just produced an artwork today
:D
Kandarihu: it would sound adorable though
Spade-Magnes[R] I went to the mall, to try to watch the live pony show, but it was like what Shizu streams
:p

Mic: i got it from a blog, and it doesn't have the source
sonicandmario85: error NaN
CCCP: Oh okay
You know how when the ds gets low on power the light goes red?
eeyup
My slightly damaged ds flickes red and green when it slow on power
its bucking weird
Come to think of it, the voicealike does work pretty well. I haven't seen Turnabout Storm so I can't even comment on whether the whiners were right or not.
I ought to give it a look so far.
And when I say slightly damaged I mean a chunck of the hull is missing
So yea...
o.O
Still works though
:)
O__________0
Whats the worst that could happen?
And there's a video by the Associated Press of the con, too.
:(
*grabs pinkemina and does to her what she did to rainbow dash*
wut?
=|
sonicandmario85: WHAT THE FUCK!
Cease all this Tom-foolery.
Is it just me or does anyone else like how pinkie looks with straight hair?
she killed rainbow dash in the fanfic cupcakes...
minus the depression
Spade-Magnes[R]: I actually like the hair
sonicandmario85: didn't rainbow already do that in Rocket to Insanity?
sonicandmario85: i know
....hey, they found a NASA employee who dressed as Twilight Sparkle. She's really attractive, too. o.o
CK|Catnap: at the con?
Yar.
Spade-Magnes[R]: I like it too, it's pretty cute :)
fucking dark fics suck
lol
A nasa employee when to the bronycon... fuck yes.
cupcakes is disturbing DX
/me throws his face out a window
Why are you reading dark fics CCCP?
CCCP: how about not-fucking dark fics?
Your average brony: a NASA employee

Haters ain't got nuthin' on us now!
/me throws the bits at the screen
We're taking over the world
CrimsonPhoenix: jeez, that's pretty sweet
CCCP how do you know they suck then?
Dark fics = perma virgins mind
You know what would be funny? If we somehow got a luna toy on the moon
Applebloom disapproves of this message.
Spade-Magnes[R]: railgun, problem solved
Srsly though, I was like "Wow, that's awesome, and she has a good outfit, AND she's good looking. Girl has it all."
I don't know why everyone hates dark fics. I love them.
Mic: FFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Mic: For somereason I never have nightmares when i read them
Anypony want something drawn for them? I'm bored as buck
One fic i read the ending doesnt seem that dark
I'm ok with dark fics :$
just the thought of them makes me want to punch the writer!
6_9
Biglaw: that's a good idea, I should draw during my lunch break...
I don't mind dark fics
I read a fic called Friendship is Tragic, it's dark, but pretty good
Dark Fics are EVIL!
Am I sick in the head if I found the ending to this fic http://www.fimfiction.net/story/35442/The-Changeling-Queen To be some what happy?
I don't have a problem with clop fics either. Sometimes I do. Sometimes/
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MhqHCpBVKY&feature=player_embedded XDDDDDD
User0 get the creative juices flowing!
For somereason i JUST CANNOT see that fic's ending as horribly grim dark
Why am I Pinkie Pie!? deserve more light
Biglaw: I took the two and only drawings I made on vacation with me and lost my drawing folder...
CrimsonPhoenix: Its second in the box so shut up
Dark Fics, make me hate all fanfics
and The chagelling Queen is first
I'm on a plane right now. WITH WI-FI!!!
Biglaw: and believe me, I do enough pony in my life...
/me nuzzles Scoot-Scootaloo.
User0 ouch, well, why not try doing stuff on a computer? That;s what I do
So what exactly determins what goes up on the feature box?
What is up, broski's!
Oh crap i forgot i was here
and hi Scoot-Scootaloo
Biglaw: well, I can't do that as well at work... and I'd rather learn to draw pencil and paper...

Bronysith: I've seen that video about 37 times!
User0 well, why not do stuff at home?
GilDash: Hiya gildy
of course there's two slot for updates on old popular fics
Doesnt the last two dots have to do with updates?
like Green right now
/me hugs killerpony7733.
/me snaps a screenie.
Biglaw: because I'm always busy doing stuff... mostly pony related whenever possible...
CrimsonPhoenix: Also I hummed and sang turntable turnabout all night...not sure how feels
/me scratches the skin off his arm
oww
http://www.theblaze.com/stories/its-colorful-and-innocent-guys-who-like-my-little-pony-turn-out-for-bronycon/
CCCP: Don't die, dying is bad.
I haven't hummed the tune but it is an entertaining one
User0 well, what I do to improve is just draw something every day, I usually draw ponies. It doesn't take too long
I just remembered something. I forgot to say hi when I entered the chat!
Hello everyone
/me hugs CCCP.
Mic: Hello Mic. :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVToU6e6FgY&feature=related
lololololol
User0 i wont!
CrimsonPhoenix: was the judge wearing glasses a reference to something>
/me huggles GilDash tight :)
I only got the Scratch and Daft references
Kayne West I believe
Biglaw: I realize, but I do a lot of things every day - on that note, I haven't played my violin for a few days now...
is the stream not working or is it just me?
Also can I ask a question about the Xbox360?
Ello, everybrony.
hello!
CountDoofus: Holla! :)
Howdy, GilDash! :)
Ello CountDoofus :)
hi GilDash
/me hugs Sylandest.
Which way is the proper way to store it? Horizontal or vertical?
Biglaw: wait, no, I was just testing my piezoelectric system when my friend brought over his amp - I lied
/me hugs Bronysith.
Its a black model
/me hugs GilDash back :)
GilDash: how are you today?
Biglaw: I played on saturday
/me hugs GilDash back
Bronysith: Oh, same old, same old. :)
Bronysith: Youself?
Also I ruined my Banjo and Kazooie Nuts and Bolts disc
/me brohoofs GilDash and MegaMoonShine, and everybrony else who wants it
GilDash: im good. waiting for my friend to finish downloading gurren lagann so i can watch his reaction
User0 it's good to hear that you play violin, and you should keep practicing with that as well. I'd say set a certain time each day for drawing, it doesn't take too long to draw something
Massive scratch ring on it
CountDoofus: /)
Note to self NEVER MOVE THE CONSOLE WITH A DISC IN IT
Damnit! WTF! for the last couple months ill ive been thinking about is ponies! MAKE IT STOP!!! D:
Spade-Magnes[R] didnt you read the manual
Bronysith: That's that crazy "Drill will pierce the heavens" anime, isn't it?
GilDash: have a good day, i hope?
it warns very specifically against that
GilDash: yes yes it is
I never liked the game anyway...
Sylandest: No, 'twere boring as all sin. :D
Spade-Magnes[R]: I broke Cars 2 the game doing that lol
And besides I was trying to figure out which way is the proper way to store the concole
Sorry, CCCP. The only cure to make you stop thinking of ponies is death.
Biglaw: well, between a full time job, violin, chainmail, drawing, work, studying, and whatever-else-my-parential-units-say... I'm a tad bit busy...
GilDash: I know those days...kinda how I am right now, lol
is it supposed to go vertical or horizontal?
Mic: What did you break and how?
Mine is the black model
CountDoofus: O_O
:(
I moved the console
Sylandest: Yeah, but I'm at work. That's the boring bit. :D
and heard a loud sound
Sylandest: GilDash *Cuddles and nuzzles*
Mic: Why would someone do that?
That or Altzheimer.
I lost my Gears2 disk doing that...
User0 Chainmail? as in... fencing?
Ugh i need to become a hater
it was terrifying
the lulz?
/me nuzzles FairysHuff|Woozy back :)
CountDoofus: Why the hay would you ever *not* want to think about ponies? :S
/me is listening to the original Dawn of the Dead theme.
I ejected the disc when it made a moise
FairysHuff|Woozy: Hiya
GilDash: ahhh, you're there right now?
I just simply forgot how good it was
I think I'm gonna use that from now on.
*noise
/me snugles FairysHuff|Woozy.
I didn't read the manual
killerpony7733: allo
Twilight works for NASA, your argument is invalid.
/me nods
killerpony7733: *Snuggles*
Reading mauals is for squares
GilDash: I don't. That's just silly, silly.
Sylandest: No, I just got back and did my work clothes ironing. :)
/me is snuggled by FairysHuff|Woozy
/me hugs killerpony7733
So does anyone own a black xbox360?
GilDash: ahhhh, i see. Well, welcome home! :)
/me hugs back CCCP
Spade-Magnes[R]: I do.
Note to self always leave the magnet that holds disc down before turning on
I don't have much to say today. Not in as much pain but quite woozy. ~_~
Which way is the proper way to store it? Vertical or horizontal?
Sylandest: Time to lay out and relax. ;)
CCCP: i know a cure that might work
FairysHuff|Woozy: you just rest and relax now. We'll take care of ya
Reading is for squares? next time I do something with technical stuff i'm going round Rectangle Pony's house!
Spade-Magnes[R] yeah. Its not eh kinect one though.
GilDash: ehehe, good idea! :$
/me snuggles FairysHuff|Woozy.
twilight_sprinkle: what is that?
Biglaw: I'm making a wristband for a friend - http://mailleartisans.org/weaves/weavedisplay.php?key=1099
Sylandest: *Smiles* ^_^
FairysHuff|Woozy: You just take it easy. :)
CCCP: become a physicist and think of portals that would teleport you to equestria, that would be a good distraction :D
*cough* hi guys. I'm in the hospital with pneumonia right now so i won't be on very frequently.
Bah time for more Sonic Generations music
GilDash: I'd be happy to take it easy. But it's boring and lonely alone. ~_~

Spade-Magnes[R]: Come on, drop it now. We don't want to get heated. :S
Spade-Magnes[R]: Hey, people learn better and get inspired through strife.
good show
he was nice...
Tovler|twibfm: At the cost of too much.
Kids, play nice.
GilDash: Hey, he made me angry by saying that
sounds good, dari.
NewDCD, SaxyPretender, you here?!
I prefer more British comedy dari. :P
Sure, why not. Heroes has always looked good.
But that's me.
Russel Howard!
Or ANYONE here that likes BBCSEX?!
Vordox: ...wot.
Spade-Magnes[R]: I appreciate that, but lashing out over a chat channel isn't going to do anything.
I fail to see how Tovler|twibfm is making fun of our country. Then again, I haven't been paying attention.
Vordox: eh?...
We found the Wavedash feature of BBCSEX. :D
Spade-Magnes[R]: Yeah, you gotta do it over a PM, man-to-man
Wavedash = Not meant to exist, but it DOES exists!
clickly click
This is the same kind of awesome feature. :D
Mfw dari stream.
Pretty much so WindWhistler.
Hey Meanwhile!
I'll like Calvin's Dad, I love how everything builds character.
Yeah, so it's understandable that Tovler|twibfm would say such things...
Allo.
/me hugs Meanwhile closely....
YOhai Meanwhile
Hiya Meanwhile
Ohai*
ohello, Meanwhile.
Yohai? Is that like Mornight?
SPAAAAAAAAACE
Though I don't really pay attention to politics much, so I don't really know what's going on here as far as political issues go.
I don't even know
XD
Pfft. xP
Yep
Meanwhile: It's like Y'ello
Awesome.
S1 E1
hey Meanwhile hows your day been
I'll be back later... I need to blow off some steam
I will now leave your presence
alexxm: Diablo-ey.
Good evening
Spade-Magnes[R]: Switch to electric
Hmmm...is that a M*A*S*H* fan I see?
Maybe some World Of Warcraft will calm my nerves
What show is this?
This is called Heroes
Spade-Magnes[R]: Uhhh...that's not such a good idea.
I've heard of this show, never seen it though.
Some 1950's pop music will soothe your fevered tempers.
I like Heroes. Never got to see the whole thing.
Excuse me?
Spade-Magnes[R]: Play a game that doesn't go online. That way you won't bump into any trolls.
Om: I gave up after the 1st season.
WindWhistler: I've delt with tolls enough I could care less
Well, it's WoW near the end of an expansion Spade-Magnes[R]. Chances are good you'll get bored and/or annoyed rapidly.
Well I wonder what this guy's schtick will be.
(Ah, it's fun to pretend to be Larry Elder on Bronystate)
Lasharus: Played it for a over a year and not bored yet
Spade-Magnes[R]: Well, you shouldn't risk running into anyone who'll anger you further.
GilDash: I just watched it on tv, so I haven't a clue what seasons I watch.
You just heard a single insult against your country and lost your cool completely Spade-Magnes[R]. With due respect, I think just now dealing with trolls is the best idea.
i always knew god was a cockroach
when im not calm i just play some minecraft XD
Except that the 10% myth has already been disproven. :P
Om: I gave up after season 1. It started to get silly.
^
Don't we use all of our brain, just only some of it at once?
Also yeah, the 10% theory is bullshit
ded
I forgot why I stopped watching after Season 2. It's not because I didn't want to.
I think I shouldn't respond to that, mostly because I'm prejudiced.
Did he died?
GilDash: I like superheroes. :S
Well, this is a show about people with super powers
Well that was blunt.
So...
He ded.
Realism is kind of out the window
GilDash: exactly. Also HI :$
Spade-Magnes[R]: No one said you shouldn't, but you may as well take it to PM. That way we're not caught up in it.
MadSurge: Holla! :)
gtg
hey MadSurge hows your day been
bye sonicandmario85
alexxm: pretty normal
season 2 was meh. season 3 was terrible
I did get kind of fed up with it after a while
But I remember loving S1
omgz, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2230398/
Tag 'em and bag 'em.
Season 1 was good. Season 2 started too slow, then got boring. Season 3... I didn't even bother with. :D

The Vita was a flop
Damn I love this show
Lil_B oh god that sucks

Losing cred over what?
Creepy, I know.
CCCP say whut....:O

Derp
Bronysith: we have to counter that with cute http://derpy.me/PhZ6a
The Happening?

The hell is nintendo losing cred over?
Bronysith: thanks for the nightmares
Dat fat kid.

He has real emo hair.
killerpony7733: nevermind :3

Poor graphics... HAH
Brinysith for the love of god kill it
Tovler|twibfm they banking heavily on the word of mouth, but hopefully some of the internets "arguments" on the Internet will fall after the Release of the WiiU
CCCP I'm watching you!!!
sequels are bad unless I want them.
CCCP: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1510/
reminds me of spderman 3 parker
Smiledog posters everywhere
Tovler|twibfm: Oh you picky bitch
the word nightmare found a whole new meaning to me when I discovered ponies
Its not all about you
Bronysith: Suddenly, nightmares.
Please tell me this "nightmare" was the earlier generations of MLP?
Bronysith: XD
Lul
He ded
Good luck finding him

Hey everypony
I like that Reggie Fils-Aime recently said "Gamers are never satified, they always want more" XD
hey Very_Silly_Filly
hai Very_Silly_Filly
spoiler...
/me ignores Project P-100 and points and laughs at Nintendo making 2 NSMB games this year.
People bitch when they want something new
Dari: Just find Hiro and go back in time silly

Back after my epic showdown of Tetris
Howdy Very_Silly_Filly.

http://derpy.me/oFEzK
Alchemist: Hmmm a interesting deal :O
Well, Mario is Nintendo's mascot, what could you expect having TWO mario games annouced for the same year?
....(no comment)
And Dashie keeps sneaking around the display :).
yay slow suicide!
Alchemist how many
BRB everypony
After that whole Operation Rainfall debacle, I don't blame Reggie for saying that. I bet Nintendo got some hate mail for not mentioning Animal Crossing at e3.
VenHur96 they don't normally do that
Gibberish is only spoken in Gibberland.
Also, hoofs down Ubisoft wins this year...espectially Rayman.
And lets not try experimenting....
the hell si Operation Rainfall?
VenHur96 yes
Ubisoft won because of Watch_Dogs and Aisha Tyler.
Meh
Spade-Magnes[R] was something to localize the RPGs on the wii, but NoA had no plans to
...
lolwut
SYLAR
Good evening.
Never heard of Rainfall so I assume it didnt work
Sylar sylar sylar sylar sylar sylar
When I get a WiiU I'll get ZombiU, Project P-100 (or whatever its name will be) and the Lega City game

:[ Fus Ro Da
VenHur96: Rayman <3
alexxm: Awesome, got a new phone today :) What about you?
Oh so THATS how Xenoblade got over here
i'm good Malavolent
Oh, and 6: Rabbid pwning in the game!

I hope NoA well get Pandora Tower over there too, Its really good
Test

Guess not, or they'd shut up.

He probably has a painting like that actually....
bitch
I need to sell my Wii. Some kind of cat burgular stole SMG2 and DKCR. I no longer have a use for it.
Who doesn't love a PRRRROMOTION!
http://goo.gl/SYWTf
Tovler|twibfm you could always soft mod it
And you dont have ANYTHING ELSE? And maybe you misplaced it
Huehuehue
Maybe just for the hell of it I should play Metroid Other M
CCCP dat human AJ

Yatta!
Freeze frame.
CCCP: that's a pretty human AJ :3
Gamer over yea
YATTA?

Diggy diggy hole
Dken2021: It'll probably be funny though
Heroes?
Dken2021: was thinkin just that
>bury ded people
But it is MY mess ~Rarity
>kid in back seat
>Let's go to grandmas
^
xD
Her super power is not parenting
Hmm what to play on my 3ds...Starfox 64 3d, Mario Kart 7 or Kid Icarus uprising
Dken2021: Oh god, first FOX, now G4! OUR SECRETS HAS BEEN EXPOSED! NUU!
or pokemon black...
None of the above. Play SM3DL
Lil_B I remember the first time I learned to bury a body. Ah child hood.
I dont own that
Spade-Magnes[R] I heard Kid Icarus is awesome, but will hurt you so much
D.L
My mom didnt buy it for me
You'd think G4 would have been on our case months ago.
Again I wish I had a job
VenHur96 kinda too late for a secret since it's been a year and a half
Lil_B: hurt me how?
Pokemon Black? I've got like 2 Porygons that need evolving.
2 million monies
did this really happen at bronycon? http://derpy.me/FFTM-
Tovler: And thus it pays off to have two ds'
Everlasting_Joy we're still a pretty young fandom
xD
wow grandma is a bish
Spade-Magnes[R] appearently it will hurt your hands much
Lil_B: never had a issue
alexxm: Yet they are more in tune with the internet then Fox.
OMG OMG OMG APPLE JACK IS BEST PONY!
LOOOOL Alchemist XD
Alchemist silly spiderman
alexxm: or at least, they should be.
"People in Hell want ice water, doesn't mean they'll get it." Well, if we believe Dante's Inferno, they'll get it.
Alchemist: Yeah, it's was unexpected, but Spiderman wonned the cosplaying contest just because of thta!
*that
And I'm glad they fixed that stupid glitch in Mario Kart 7
CCCP silly filly all ponies are best pony, people just have preference :P
Spade-Magnes[R]: I stopped doing that because pokemon games have wi-fi and such
every woman in this shows a bitch
Alchemist: Spiderman.mp4 :D
ohai Vordox , I have a Question
Hai Lil_B And what?
alexxm: Not true, this chick isn't.
Maku Wuhu was so abused
Meanwhile most are then
killerpony7733: i agree, thats why i said apple jack is best pony, because all ponies are best pony
Meanwhile: yet...
Breaking and entering, not a good think to have on your record.
Yeah, it's not a very good standard is it.
CCCP: I can agree with that :)
MadSurge: C:
Vordox how do I make a server in Terraria? I can click on host, but what do others have to do to join me?
Makes a change from damsel in distress though.
who is sylar btw?
Lil_B: Your IP and port
What am I even watching?
You'll see who Sylar is
Narnia anyone?
BRAIN PICS
Heroes
I am so going to get Kingdom Hearts 3D
All we know at the moment is he kills loads of people
DashieMusic2: the villain who kills people
Lightning-Quill this is heroes
dat map
DashieMusic2: his goals are unknown at this point.
Spiderman has been busy on it
Sylar is a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude.
this is my map, there are many like it, but this one is mine
Vordox ok, must find out then what my IP and Port is then XD, Ghosties kept asking me when the server will be up again so Insaid I'll make one until yours gets up again
SINNED
Look guys RELIGION :P
Lil_B: Just go google whatsmyip.org
i have cosinned
AW SHIET RELIGION
wall of crazy
Then give your friends that IP
Yeah that sounds safe.
I've never heard of it. Oh well happens when you don't watch t.v anymore
>safe
its a trap
>screams
Vordox thanks
Well....
Bad move lady
chubby guy will protect you from the unstoppable murderer, youre safe!
ITS A TRAP
Bam/.
HERO
She sure showed him

Wibbley wobbley timey wimey.
^
Vordox and how does the Port work?
Well time to play some Starfox 64 3D
You don't say "bomb" on a plane without consequences.
http://goo.gl/C57za
Lil_B: When you host you get a 4 digit port, use that
BOMB!
Wub wub wub
:D
xD

Vordox ok, thanks :)
:D
XD
dawwww, she wants to snuggle
lol
Been there, in coach. I feel your pain sun.
I am so going to buy the new paper mario
*son.
wat no
Yeah, I swear, if that was me, she'd be a target for my new invention
why?-i called the agency and told them
Very_Silly_Filly: What is your new invention?
Spade-Magnes[R]: Same, looks amazing
now kiss
Very_Silly_Filly what is your invention
Everlasting_Joy: It's a banana
Ok now the show seems interesting
The truth is, I can fly, and your ex-boyfriend really CAN draw the future.
But new Paper Mario seems to be replacing sidekicks with Mario attacking multiple times with stickers. I don't like that.
That shoots miniture plasmoid quantum beams
Oh this bit
IT ISNT EVEN OUT YET
Is pretty damn cool
>implying that I won't buy it.
Very_Silly_Filly: :D, I need not know anything else.
Dat lying hoebag.
>Something new comes outs and with different mechanics
And as you can imagine, it hurts like hell
>hates on it even before it comes out
Dari :3
Helpers were kinda useless anyway
http://goo.gl/kA9ke
Sounds like Mario is in a sticky situation
N64 one only had like 2 useful helpers
The helpers were god usless in the first game
CCCP all this human AJ! :D
free beer? why didnt I have parties like that?
killerpony7733: :D
Never trust Jackie with anything.
I hope Lady Bow wasn't one of the useless ones.
Alchemist: Because you invited me, and when I found out it was a drunkenparty, I got some terrorists to blow up the venue
Bow actually had use in most boss fights
I was at a party the other day where there was a party across a field from the party, with loads of free drinks Alchemist
Like Huffen Pufff
*puff
stalker
are you a spy?
Party dari's in the house toniiiiight.
mission accomplish
...nope
Bow ended up being useless due to Boss's defense.
Jim: Nope, just a self military person....(OF DOOM)
Am I the only one that feels like the odd one out?
O.o
Lightning-Quill: where
Well how else are you supposed to dodge that lightning attack?
Watt was pretty much the only partner you needed
Pretty much anywhere
Oh look another bitch.
Goodie.
^
And in the second game they had the deceny to give the partners hitpoints
Lightning? You mean the crystal king's ice beam?
Yep, lets shoot her
CK|Catnap: No kidding.
>gets arrested for saving girl
be happy you bastard
>people think you're a derrange murderer
Tovler: I was talking about huff N puff
>get attacked by the real derranged murderer
>come home
>get whined at
>Feels bad man.
oh if you guys only knew what this b*tch does... :D
Dari: He needs to backhand this woman.
>cue me and pulls stoopid faise
Ice beam what?
The partners getting knocked out with one hit was retarded
And then they got assassinated
By me
/me arrests Very_Silly_Filly
....this is going to go wrong, I can tell. >_>
But if you used Bow, Huff n Puff would have all his Ruff Puff lackeys
Turns out he's kind of a rapist.
and rape..
time for rape
Aside from bow and the gel THERE IS NO WAY to dodge the lightning attack from huff N puff
>really like
/me activates insane heat beam.
It's raping time.
raaaaape
I dont use her for the entire fire
jocks
I use her when he charges up
Oh dude.
ded
ded
SHE DED
random wood
You are a Duuuuumb shit.
NOw its appropriate http://derpiboo.ru/26628
eeeeeewwwwwwwwwww
she fakin it lol
I think I just used Lakilester's evade cloud on Huff n puff mostly
YOU ass
what a jerk
Like if you crid evertim
if i were here id get up and scare the shit out of him
*were her
And then she shows up at school tommorow just fine.
that or Grind using Amazy Dayzees until I've maxed out.
It was nice every partner had unique dialouge
twilight_sprinkle: I already blew him up with a rocket launcher :)
for the bosses too
.....
That was around 7.4 seconds before you arrested me
Very_Silly_Filly: i thought i arrested you <.<
Also I may be the only pony in the room that actually uses Goombario
twilight_sprinkle: If I were her, I'd play dead and have the guy freak out for nothing. Serves him right.
I find Goombario annoying
Cop in the middle of nowhere?
why are they pulled over?
CountDoofus: thats what she doin
Seems legit
Fan attacks are annoying
Fans are annoying
Everything is annoying
Raeg
Oh noes
Why am I even talking about PM64? TTYD was better in every possible, even without Bow
Very_Silly_Filly: is annoying annoying?
twilight_sprinkle: Never seen Heroes. Dunno what's gonna happen anywhere :p
Dirty poliecemaen
I say run he might be fake cop or evil cop
Both of them are good
CountDoofus: Even annoying is annoying
CountDoofus: neither have i
dari: That spelling hurt me.
:>
Haey, aye am polismaehn
Well then
Very_Silly_Filly: Don't be silleh xD
I'm just as confused as the next person
I was being serious =s
Very_Silly_Filly laern to tipe you dumm idot!
NOE
Smiledog is on stage
Inb4 that doesn't go anywhere.
lol
And fuck Ken T Koopa
waaaait
Dat lame joke opening
Very_Silly_Filly: I know. I was making a joke because of your name :D
i think i know how sylar is
*who
Watt destroyed Kent C Koopa for me
Spade-Magnes[R] Ludvig van koopa is best koopa
/me does Garrys' Mod arm flailing and shoots rocket launcher repeatedly all over the blows the building up
Who do you think?
The guy who invented the bananaphone
Which Petrelli?
Well Watt peirces defense so thats a given
Well, you'll see
Also the fact that if you fail one of the quizes in the castle you have to fight 3 anti guys is a dick move
One left.
That broken D-down jump badge did the same thing too
I'd laugh if they did fly.
DESTINY
GET SMACKED
bitch :D
lol
Ah
hello everypony
hi Elondras
I love Hiro.
wow
Anti was annoying enough
Howdy Elondras.
Hiro is best pony
3 at once is bad
Destiny. :D

The politician isn't Peter
Hookers drink and gambling. Destiny.
I go to bootcamp tomorow! :D
/me hugs Jim, Everlasting_Joy

No seriously i go to bootcamp tomorrow morning
Howdy CountDoofus!
hmm?
Whoa silent mind
meditating
Emptiness. Now that's creepy.

This is why I think to myself sometimes: "I know you can hear this"
twilight_sprinkle: then you would also hear disturbing thoughts
what?
in 2 days it has been 2 months since i placed my WLF order. gotta love dem long production times
o.o
he only had one drink?
Spade-Magnes[R]: true, but its not like people arent disturbing enough as it is
At one point I wanted to go to bootcamp out of my own free will
Sylandest: Oie!
>a talking dog
i miss much?
>smiledog
And man Jr Troopa gets annoying
smiledog millioner
A talking smiledog.
Lightning-Quill: I'd die in boot camp - I don't have the physical endurance/strength...
ahh, bootcamp. You'll be amazed at all the military stereotypes that are there.
