1)Ponies don't know war.
I can see it being feasible that a country could experience a long, long period without open warfare. But not to the point that they are alien to the concept. And history shows that nations that begin to sneer at arms and armor and armies as "barbaric" or "unnecessary" find themselves at war--- or enslaved---- a very very short time afterwards. They shall beat their plowshares into
swords, and slave in the fields for those that didn't.
waaat
and thus, their romance was ruined.[

ALicorn foal
With Trixie.
Twilight's legs
That alicorn in the back.
Spike is everypony.
wtf
so much 4th wall
So, question: Does the sun make an audible ticking noise? Is it audible to everypony, or just people within sight of Canterlot? Is it psychically projected into everypony's brain? Is it so loud everypony goes temporarially deaf?
dinky was there...
Tovler: I remember when it used to be, those were fun times.
sorry i was bored
OMG DIZY DOO!
DERPY WAS LUAGHING AT HER!!!!1
You just don't know it yet.
they exile them and then put them in a prison in the place they banish them to
knowing celestia, this is not that paranoid
Actually, they just hold you back a grade, make you repeat it...
I could write in colour and everything
6_9
lol
I hope they do an episode explaining the origins of Alicorns
derpy is my mom
seriously Celestia WOULD do that
This is all in Spike's mind.
To an alicorn, all other ponies are kindergardners.
these colors are really sharp, I like it
if she wanted to
i was 21 in pre k
oh god twlight dont crap on the floors
my god! spike is all the elements of harmony!
Twilight is going mad
childhood problems....

For once, Spike is the sensible one.
No, she wouldn't.

Dragon of Harmony. Try and take that down with a Fus ro dah.
poor Spike
brb pinkie's calling
can't she solve her own problem by writing... my brain hurts.
... why is she marching downstairs again?
Spike predicts the future.
"He's got nothing" chocolate milk
maybe, its nice though
Aw man I am having feelings like twilight right now O_O I dun wanna watch this
spike knows
I love that 8 bit sound when Twi's ears flop down
Like that theory about how Ash is really in a Coma

Rarity is like a preteen girl
Dear Princess Celestia, today I helped Rarity find her tape measure
the greatest task
be back for the mare-a-thon CYA
I get the feeling there are no real diamonds in ponyworld
Silent Hill takes the cake with every ending.
But it happens. Sometimes the thing you're looking for is literally right in front of you.
and... gone

im still waiting for my magic kindergarden fanfic...
:[
4th wall break
Meanwhile: you ARE a bit arrogant at times
thanks for stating the obvious!
Oh shit son, she means it.
BEITYCH
because nothing is worse than a friend going to kindergarten
Stubborn, perhaps, and I have no sense of tact. And buck the police.
trollestia: make a big deal when the student whos saved ur asss twice is a little late on 1 letter.
needs more focus
:(
I think Celestia really would have sent Twilight back to Kindergarten. She totally would.
Aw I wanna give spike a hug
dat ad?
her mane is like ice cream :P
spike is peepin
This isn't angry Celestia, this is Disappointed Celestia.
Meanwhile: can you act like an arrogant douche?
dat chest
"I'm a bad student! I deserve to be punished!"
tardy

Aww, Pinkie!:)
watch her mane get bad again
aaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
omg pinkie sadface
Dat lag
pinkie best cry
emangamer is quite tactless
Molesting?
EYEBROW RAISE
No social cues exist on the internet.
But as all of these traits were added as a conglomeration of the fans and the writers Big Mac comes off less as an omnipetent super being and more of a humble guy with nothing more in life than to do his job
This is Celestia upset with herself for not giving Twilight any damned affection for a year.
orly?
BEy-TCH!!!!!!
Dash makes every episode 20% more awesome
*trollface*
wait for it....
"Punish all of us, Celestia! Punish us so much!"
I'm fairly tactless
which is a contradiction in terms
take her away!!!!!
:3
Dat sexy rarity voice
Time for fuzzy feelings
and now shes going to take advantage of the mane six
PARTY SOFT
lol
DAT SHADOW
molestia: MORE WILLING VICTIMS YAY
StinkomanFan: good point
your thinking of the wrong celestia...
Ok thinking about it I might be kinda arrogant in a House sort of way.
trollestia wtf are you doing.. this is ridiculous
plot
...
Change the format of the show.
wingboner
and you all go to the moon
actually emangamer isn't tactless, he's just a bit of a douche.
As I said in the beginning, I LOVE YOU ALL!
MALES
YUS! YUS! YEAAAHHHHH!
You all write a letter! *Trollestia*
And letters are now optional.
OH GAWD
woot
And Celestia hasn't interacted with Twilight since this season!
Homework for everybody!
^
AH
Dat Celly plot!

WTF is up with that?
Molestia is letting them go because they consented. She can't handle willing sex.
Homework for everypony!!!

GROUP HUG@
it's like a free pass for lazy!
Two months later: "Dear Princess Celestia, i didn't learn anything. LOL. I was right all along"
kinda want to see how the princess would have punished her lol
Why is everypony so happy?
no he's not
Do the CMC need to report on friendship?
Meaning that AJ didn't have to send that letter to her in the first place.
two eyes
She's expecting some male.
TROlolololololololololololololoolo

CELESTIA WANTS YOUR WANKER
"I didn't learn anything!

I think that Big Mac is okay, he's got no negative traits per se, but he's deliberate, and it could be mistaken as dumb.
Whatever
Don't ask me about Scoot.

our fandom has some really fucking annoying people in it
Unless you're Stephen King!
A Clown is my friend....but Mimes are my Enemies!!!

"Good newvs, eferyboody!"
i feel sorry for that clown...
oh lawl, I'm 14 and I'm already a cynical, jaded bastard/
Celestia is a trickster mentor.
Nice and chubby baby
Most people who make r34 do so for the exact reason it looks like.

Just because it's been segued into the artificial R34 construction doesn't make it less valid from an artistic point.
... if they live in the water tower, where does the water come from
GO AWAY JEWISH CLOWN
^
lol
The realization that Grown-ups make mistakes.
TL;DR: People putting the kind and gentle Celestia as a tyrant are idiots.

Hello good oldschool cartoon violence :)
Philimina is ok with this.
To be honest....R34 doesn't bother me that much. But only to an extent.
please not the singing
pedo defense: A Giant Mallet
Davie_Jones: agreed
If only it was the mime

All I got from that livejournal was a cool story.

Luna on the moon: Celestia banishing people to the moon because she's jealous of power, or just a lesson about how sometimes people in power do things out of fear.
Not really, Scoota

That was awesome
The community in general isn't that bad (that's me talking to myself)

F*** Logic!
i'm in da sky
Then comes Luna, before the Nightmare Night episode we saw her as scared of the world before her
poor clown...
the 'TOO THE MOOONAAAAAAAH BEEYETCH' video, whilst lowbrow, is good for a cheap laugh
Anything not by the original creators is wrong technically.
Meanwhile: no, I mean morally wrong
how much things had changed
I have come to terms with myself when I say I like the fandom
derpypie: lol
Meanwhile: not canonically wrong
don't, with the booms!
oh thats alright
hai DoctorTimeyWimeySICK
00,10no boom just buffer
Morals.
That doctor is obviously a nazi!
If I was the clown I would hide and then say I did the Hour show
O_O....but...he was driving around the tower in a circle...
Singing?
lol
Nightmare Night was good proof of why writers SHOULD NOT always listen to the fans.
-_-
I have one moral.

Say hi to Luna for us

Tooo the Mooooon!
clowns. in. spaaaaace!
What animal are they anyway? Are they dogs?
oh
Ohhh
Moidah!
lol
team clown blasting off again!
Luna represents our fear of being rejected by society for who we are
Nothing the fanon could make would be a good as that.
He has been banished.....TO THE MOOOONNNAAAAHHHH!
They ignored fanon Luna.
MOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAHHHHHHH BEY-TCH!!!
then I agree completely Davie_Jones Luna was great
its time for you to go away clown gogogogo to the moon
They're 1930's puppy creatures.

Any TwilightSparkle room regulars here? If so, I just wanna shout good night to all of you. This chat's been crazy.
Rather than making her afraid of the world, they expanded on the fact that she was trapped on teh moon for 1000 years and was used to old customs.

My friend and I came to this conclusion... as delightful as it is to see nods to the Bronies, Studio B shouldn't go out of its way to amuse us.
TRY TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD!
so true
Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle
MmmHmm
thx-1138
The pinkie and the brain
And then the Cakes, suprisingly there relationship has remained untouched by the fandom
you guys weren't kidding about Shed.mov, it sucked, it was Happy Tree Friends minus the originality and humor
Pinkie Pie never dies, she just changes form
the :O and the:)
pinkie, pinky and the brain
although it is fairly funny
Oh my god, Who's streaming?
right now, she's Pinky
The show is great because it wasn't ashamed to be silly.

It was Studio B saying "Hey guys, we know you watch, and we think that's cool"
ah ha ha ha hu huu

o RLY?
No, but he did Orson Welles impressions A LOT.
^^
Narf

There are really only 7 major characters.

damn this show is old!

A TV show inside a TV show?
To be honest, Spike needs more love.

MahBoi
Shhh...I havnt lost connection yet
To anypony interested in the slightest, I was rather rude here a week prior and want to apologize to the administrators. One, for those acts, and two, for taking so long to make an apology. Maybe three for almost considering breaking the rules just to do it. If anypony here saw, it was horrible, I feel horrible still, and will because it was out of line...even for me...
lol
Night

Tovler: true story

Everyone remember the Daring-Do character?
:'(
Hello everypony.
is mayonaisse an instrument?
Tolver: I did the same. Did you watch the Transformers movie from the TV show?
>mfw LaurenFaust
hi
no
I wish
really, look at some of Billboard's year-end lists from back then. There was loads of awful stuff that made it big back then.
haha time for minecraft, see you guys in less then 6 hours!
alrighty
no, patrick, mayonaise is not an instrument
metalrainbowdashchan: I love dat movie
Sweetie belle: OH COME ON!
WHO IS A BIG FLUTTERSHY FAN!?
So how is everyone tonight?
happy wheels time
No patrick Mayonaise is not an instrument
I like all ponies.
everypony is a fluttershy fan
my brain is herping a derp right now
mayonnaise is a good snack...
I'm fans of the entire mane6
IKR
pwny is right
MahBoi777: I wanna watch that movie
Better question: Who doesn't hate Gilda / Trixie?
Im more of a Pinkie pie and RD fan
well crap/
I like trixie
I went out to hang with some friends, and when I got back, the dog had chewed up all the empty soda cans, and took a crap in the middle of the living room.
I don't, mostly because of headcanon
WE ALL R FLUTTERSHY FANS NO NEED TO ASK!
crazy ponies, pwny.
Pinkie Pie ftw
You can't say Fluttershy is your favorite. That's just cheating.
I LOVE TRIXIE!!!
FiM is canceled. kthxbi
/me sighs
only crazy pwnies
How annoying.
Gilda was kinda a jerk...
Im feeling fan freaken tastic thanks for asking
I don't like fluttershy
*ponies
Did you play the Indiana Jone's theme song when she was on screen?
My eyes feel like they're about to fall out
"Can't remember what you had to do today. Remember Every Mistake you Ever made"
Gilda is terrible
10,02I'm back ^_^
HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE FLUTTERSHY!
I did some calculations and check on my Reciever. The mareathon starts at 4AM Utah time -.-
3SB~
hi
dat SB
I can honestly say Gilda is the only character I despise
Fluttershy? I don't understand it. She's just a background character, after all.
00,10Sup sb
is the stream down for anyone esle?
3WB :3
Hello SB64
Gilda is a greedy jerk
Ha ha!
i think laurenfaust is trolling....
and wb SuperBrony64
TOY_PON3: I rewatched the Transformers Movie because of thr DRSMOOV parodies. The soundtrack really drove that movie.
I don't understand wehre Trixie's fans came from either
SHES NOT!
10,02So...did I miss movie night? :3
to quote the great Mike Kristopelt
shes just meh to me :
Gilda is a jerk, yes.
dammit RawketLawnchair, don't start that fight
Who said they disliked Fluttershy?! I am outraged, she is so nice...
I dislike trixie
:P
3yes you did :3
SCREW YOU FLUTTERSHY HATERS!
sadly yes :(
LOL
pwny, don't deny it, you know it's true.
hey SuperBrony64 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdZ1va0AQYc
trixie fans come from EqD duh
EEYUP
Is the stream down?
While i woud like her to come back, gilda can stay the hell away
10,02LEAVE FLUTTERSHY ALONE
Fluttershy fans are batshit insane.
it was too 80s
I prefer flutterbitch
Tolver: Indeed I love the soundtrack
Trixie: Showmare. Got heckled at a show, and plot demanded that she lose everything she had.
That's all there is to say on the matter.
fuck off
somepony said they didn't like fluttershy because of the moe stereotype in anime
ironic ain't it?
I'm a Fluttershy fan and I'm not completely insane.
FLUTTERSHY IS THE EPIC ONE!
10,02Dat ValtheJean
I also prefer flutterbitch
at least she has GUTS
hmm.....do I dare buy a blind bag?
but that was so stupid because she's not a moe stereotype in an anime
flutterage?
Pwny :'(
so is the clock accurate? the mare-o-thon starts at 6a.m.est
Gilda: Wanted to spend time with a friend, and Pinkie kept interrupting. Have one bad day, the entire fandom hates you.
what about speed and agility?
I'm moving to Germany just so I can get a McScootaloo.
I love every character because they're all so different.
10,02mario_pony: i liek dat video :3
you'd think the fans wud be calm, nnnnope, they insane
Cult Leader Fluttershy is such a badass
2,14 dat...superbrony?
I'm actually waiting for the new McDonalds set in March.
10,02So we meet again...
Dumb streem
SINCE EVERYPONY IS BEST PONY, IT IS INCORRECT TO DISCRI MINATE OR ELECT ANY PARTICULAR PONY IN A BEST OF ALL ROLE SINCE THERE IS NOT ONE WHO CAN FIT THAT TITLE PERFECTLY.
Too bad they look the same as the last McDonalds set
aaaannnnnnd I jacked first comment... Yay~
/me laughs just thinking about the 80s Transformers movie
no fandom is without it insane section
waaiting, is the hardest part
Celestia is best Princess.
UHF was an amazing movie
With an addition to Lilyblossom.
ohai Princess_Luna
they do?
and Princess_Cadence
horseapples, Luna is best princess
NO, LUNA!
dat SuperBrony64
/me laughs because the movie was actually one big ass commercial
i actually love all ponies equally without any discrimination....
10,02Dat Simon2 :D
Hi
/me 's brain is now pudding
DEBATE!!!
and i'm back from kinda working
just making sure, this is endless buffering for everypony else?
Luna wins in my book
At least Celestia has had more screentime than Luna.
I thought they were just using the 2011 picture in the news announcement
/me shutters thinking about Weird Al as Rambo in UHF
One princess has the name Molestia/Trollestia. The other does not. QED, Luna.
has there been any additional news about mcdonalds?
What? I'm not best Princess?! Hi Phase4. Have I met you or have you confused me with another?
no. Go to happymeal.com
Ughh
Wayne's world?
00,10it's still bad for you
Princess_Luna: i'm just saying hi
well, I think FiM has proven that something being a long ass commercial can still be good.
yes Wayne's World!
I'm still sort of scared about that buffering you guys
I see nothing on the stream
ohai Phase4
luna is frosty
Oh, well hello, nice to meet you.
hell, Digimon did that a decade ago.
:(
......im going to do it......once those Mc Donalds toys are on shelves I will order two meals, one that I will usually buy and one I will say that its for my niece.... they will never know...*gulp*
hai MahBoi777
So the stream is down?

I'm going in loud and proud asking for my little pony toys
Is that a problem @Sumica?
I'd just buy all the toys.
IT'S A TRAP
Thank you Luna
I would hug all of them no matter what
I would hug all of the mane six
I just think it will be weird going up and saying "I want a happy meal... no GIRL toy please"
well, the pokemon anime was kinda shit.
if they don't like it they can suck it
00,10hit that f5 like it owes you monie
Well, the Digimon anime was actually good.
ahh, veemi
00,10nope not a problem

yay :)
Brock was... there
yay Veemi
I just got on this site. I have no idea what I'm doing.
/me heads to McDonalds and orders everything on the menu
it was good when we were kids and would watch whatever brightly colored japanimation that was on the TV. Looking back though? It was average at best in the early seasons, and now it's just kind of a sad little franchise still plodding along.
Misty was a bitch
da fuck is this?
Now it is lagging...
back
we umm... what the cupcakes are we watching?
Lul jepordy music
ya stream is working now
lol
MARS
what are we watching
can we have livestream instead?
:D
YEAH!
Iris is cuuuuuuute <3
I think McDonald's will just sell you the toy if you ask, won't they?
This is Bill Nye.
Syrup
Sounds like the bill nye voice
ohhh bill
Typically, they don't with me...our McDonalds in Ohio are tools.
OMG I WAS RIGHT IT IS BILL NYE
PONIES?
???????????????/
the biggest problem is that, because every new region means ash starting back at zero, there's no character development.
Tis a lie, it's still bufferception
Bill Nye the Crystal Meth Guy.
mmmm... Syrup.... drool
I hope the sell them
^
And... Lily Blossom is the new pony in happymeal set
cool story bro
Little bill.
???...what is he doing?!
noticed that and dislike it
I used to like him.
ANYONE HERE WORK FOR MY LITTLE PONY SHOW? I DO!
ahh now i can see the stream
is there no stream?
Nope.
I met bill nye
HE DARED ME
u doooooo?
I wish.
WRITEity: It wasn't the case in Diamond/Pearl. in that case. iris became as boring ass hero
as if by magic, the stream content changed
I remember when they called anime "Japanimation".
its why the first and maby second seasons are the only good ones
i gotta do it
the stream is lagging :[
almost like it's technology
fillyfillyy: yes there is
YES IM A STORYBOARD ARTIST!

I HELPED DRAW A BACKGROUND IN THE NEW EPISODE!
Damn bogans.

My first was Bubblegum Crisis
@luna, is the mareathon being streamed?
4th wall BROKEN
I want those hair things
I like how Bill blocked the L and it spelled TIT.
i missed intro
I really think the anime should have done what the Manga did: Every new region we start out with a new protagonist, new setting, and new storylines.
/me cries
Hell Teacher Nūbē i think i don't really remember
^_^ stream's back & Bill Nye is still on! The fun has been Doubled!!
OMG
I saw it on Youtube
Well, technically, my first was Ranma 1/2, But it was the Manga.
AM I RLY THE ONLY MY LITTLE PONY STAFF MEMBER HERE!?
I think it's still there
although, I would have preferred if Ash was ditched all together, like they do with Yugioh
I have one of thoughs
Princess_Luna: it was on Youtube for way longer than I thought it would be, probably still there
song!
it wud seem so
/me is sad because the veemi is laggy as shit

Tenchi Muyo and Record of Lodoss War after that.

/me 07,01will fix it
I demand Oink oink oink.

I will be leaving momentarily, there are things I need to check...
RainbowDash48: we all work on the show, we're just more quiet about it
Santa is not rea- *URK* --- its real....yes this is Daf45...... I like posting random junk and make dumb comments
My head hurts
Bye, StinkomanFan
F5 worked.
RainbowDash, you are not apart of the Staff.
woudl you guys prefer livestream or youtube that's in 720p
night StinkomanFan
My first anime was Maxstar 1
nite, StinkomanFan
Sleep well, dream of ponies
from F.M.E.
What do you mean? Yami/Yugi was the main character for Yu-Gi-Oh for it's entire existance.
i agree with red pegasus
Now that Derpy is canon, the entire fandom officially contributes to the show
youtube
ITS BACK ON YAY!
how many people work on MLP to begin with?
oh god lag
sleep well StinkomanFan
I like livestream with the reactions of everyone
You know what? LiveStream is the best IMO
true
if u play derpy rolled for me
I forgot about the original videos...how could I have forgotten that?
why livestream?
Night StinkomanFan
the fandom can achieve anything
We need more derpy episodes.
Davie_Jones: he means GX and 5Ds
Hasn't Derpy been abandoned because special interest groups thought she made fun of the less fortunate?
Refer to Derpy Live Chat
the fandom is badass
Early 90s rap!
Those are spinoffs
why is everyone talking about youtube and livestream
livestream is mostly smooth for me
Stormpony: nope
best one ever.
Stormpony: There'll be riots
Window!
Davie_Jones: You never heard of the card games on motorbikes meme?
Derpy isn't gone/
the others are a bit more laggy
livetube
no they said that no one is going to
no, they're just continuations of the franchise.
Don't cp[y that floppy!
Seen the show actually
aww

Tovler: I'm rewatching data squad because I hate myself apparently.
The other bird is like: Come at me bro.
