You need to train first TheRandomkid321.
Your body CAN die if you do it.
DashWithRainbows AHd plenty of trainin.
DashWithRainbows What?
2 weeks and you have an even higher chance of dying
I done research on it a bit before doing so.
DashWithRainbows... Im gonna sit this one out...
Fair do's.
I just don't get the point of sleep :|
I... DOnt like death.
Sleep is pointless it's a waste of time to me
Not bad, Viri
Can blasting usic through headphones do long term damage to your brain?
I need to write a one and a half minute analysis on Iago
and the themes of the scene
idk
Does anyne even "watch" These TF2 clips or are they just here incase you wanna look for a sec.

Okay.

Hello everypony, I'm back and tired as ever
leaves^
Good afternoon everypony :)
Nya
killerpony7733: Good morning
So Othello's good eh?
Good xP
gm
good morning
Om i finally woke up at a much more reasonable time just got up here 20 minutes before its 1 am :D
time for me to go to sleep xD
killerpony7733: Much more reasonable
Om yeah :$
Is it a bad idea to leave Desktop Ponies running 24/7, or will it not matter that much?
ohai everypony
Hello Jim!^_^
Herro Jim :3
Hey there, Jim. :)
And hello there, killerpony7733. :)
Hello killerpony7733...:3
And BroKnee. :)
Ninjazz: So many ponies joined in, and I didn't even realize it.:D
Hello Ninjazz :)
Ninjazz: afternoon :) and that to you too LoyalDash
yah
heh Viri
any one here got fear 3 on pc
Can anypony answer my question? :o
Iago's relationship with his wife is quite intriguing
Hey Ninjazz :)
It's hard to tell whether he actually loves her or if he just wants to use it
What question?
er
use her
Hello there, Ponies47. :)
Is it a bad idea to leave Desktop Ponies running 24/7, or does it not matter?
imo, I think Iago would have loved her at one stage
BroKnee: Really, it doesn't matter, but it kind of slowls down your computer when you put too many of them
Perhaps you shouldn't.
it dont matter it just takes up ram and ur gpu
not much though
how many u runnin at once
I get that sense from him, that he at least used to love her, but maybe grew out of the feelings, or he still does love her, but keeps his plan hidden because he knows she wouldn't approve
LoyalDash I only use 5 :p
BroKnee: Oh, that is not too bad then.:P
that should be no prob then
They're a very joking pair though, there's that scene where they toss jests at each other or whatever you call it
LoyalDash And thank you for responding ^.^ <3
ur welcome
BroKnee: Awww, dat wub.:D
14mhm, I think he was in love with Desdemone only because of her body. But maybe he still loved his wife, sentimentally
the one after Emilia finds the handkerchief and is like "I have a thing for you" and then Iago is like "It is a common thing for a wife-" and Emilia "hah!" and then Iago "To have a foolish wife"
LoyalDash I gots more than enough wub for every time anypony does something good :3
I don't think Iago would have been in love with Desdemona
lol the remix
BroKnee: Yay for dat wub!
I think he only really wants to sleep with her to make a cuckold out of Othello for his revenge
LoyalDash wubwubwub <3 <3 <3
He says that
but Iago's motives are very unclear anyway
i better learn to talk in Australian
BroKnee: So, many......wubs......argh, so many!:D
well i had nothing better to do so i cleaned up the kitched :/
LoyalDash: 500 wubs later :D
*kitchen
Don't worry LoyalDash, I won't give you any
Om: :<, no.no wub?
LoyalDash: Here, borrow some of mine >:D <3
Okay!:D

I'm having an oral math exam on tuesday, fml

WallDives: Hmm. I din't recall any of those
Ninjazz: Sad face
Probably because you repressed them, Om.

WallDives: There is a good chance of that.
Anypony?

Jim Ty :3,Tthats enough for me to find it ^.^ <3
Hello Kriel_Pony!:3
:)
Haha
Well
Iago is obviously insane
But it seems his motives are just to piss off his enemy
FOOOREEEVER
4
Ever
14Disney should have made an animated movie about it, so I could puke rainbows when they let him sing
/me runs
LOL
Hey
Thats like... Forever
Singing villains can be bad*ss
5ever

14"puking RAINBOWS"
14x3
why does his chat have fancy colours whereas mine is white
lol
dat Pony mod
server full I take it?
BACK :)
05pony_816: colors indicate mods :)
Ah
Ohai Wrek :)
I don't think Iago is insane
The rest of us can just look on the colors with disdain that is really jsut masking jealousy... so pretty
Oi Wrek ever thought of streaming some serious sam sometime in the future? :$
sup
Oh? Why?
What makes you think he's insane?
did my chat freeze
Well for one thing, the want to kill is against nature :p
Second
mario_pony: don't think so
Nope. Just a slow night, it seems.
oh k
C'mon everypony, we gata get this chat pumpin :)
Although this is Shakespeare being Shakespeare, I think he talks to himself about his plot
BroKnee: with 99 people? over half aren't exactly here
:D
Still >:D WE CAN DO DIS
/me tosses grenade into chat
Wubz fewr everypony <3
BroKnee: i don't mind but right now i'm eating food
/me Eats the nade
and then people like me that never say anything
:3
/me action rolls behind the couch
Ghosties: RUUUUN
/me jumps back to the couch Ninjazz is behind
I am barely here at all
C'mon guys its just a muffin :3
04BroKnee is truly a bad enough dude to rescue the president
Or just crazy enough.
And he's paranoid and delusional
Are you a bad enough dude?
What? Who's crazy? :o <.>
that would be me
RUUUUUUUUN FOR YOUR LIIIIIIFE!
Crazy brohoof Om /}
So like
Is it possible to join this server in any way
BroKnee: you got a spike on the end of your hoof?
:D
Om: Don't do it, man. He's hiding a nail in that brohoof.
Shhhh I was tryin to prank him >:(
Ninjazz: that made me giggle
BroKnee: //e==
:)
^-^
pony_816: just ask a Phase4
pony_816: ask him for the IP
Iago never aimed to kill with his own hands
pony_816: Or look for him in the Bronystate Steam Group
And join from there
Do any of the Mods want free stuff on TF2? I stoped playing it :3
Not until the end near Roderigo and Cassio and then Emilia
04No thanks
Iago is driven by jealousy and bitterness
05what kind of stuff?
What ever I have
It was an
Alaskan
Bull
Worm!
inb4 bribery.

05Phase4: doign the same thing as you are
BroKnee: derp aren't logged into steam though
I get a sense of innocent malevolence, if you call it that, from Iago
00,02yeah, but i'm going to stop soon
You know when children start pulling off legs from insects like flies, etc.?
moin everypony :)
00,02either change server or game
I sorta get that feeling from Iago
hai Invi
05one more map and ill take over
/me huggles Jim
But he gets caught up in his own game, just like once a child pulls off one leg, he/she doesn't stop until he/she has pulled off all the leg
s
/me huggles
BroKnee: got a invite from a killerguythefox?
And he gets drawn in by his own pride, intelligence, skill and also the power and sense of empowerment he gets from manipulating everyone else

I dont know nothing about ponies sadly.
Everyone knows all the names of all the background ponies.
I dont have a clue.
I know a few but not all :P
Applejack is best pny.
pony
Derpy is best PONY!!!
NO. EVERYPONY IS BEST PONY! :[
Twilight is the least popular..
yamichan: Should of been here for the awards. She was awarded best pony
Rainbow Dash is the most popular over all.
every one has a Best pony
Twilight Sparkle is considered best pony here.
My favorite pony is Rarity.
Really? You'd say no one likes her being the stubborn typical blonde girl.
Lol
me. IT'S EVERY FREAKIN PONY! Well but a few. Like Blueblood :|
I hate Blueblood
Lyra plush is best pony.
Don't be a cop out. Everypony is not best pony.
yamichan: THAT'S BANNED FROM HERE
Lol
xD
YEEEES!
RARITY!
Whyy? it's lovely.
DERPY IS BEST PONY!!!
/me does a victory dance
You can use it in so many ways.
Ponies47: a simple but silly attempt at a OC using a pony creator thing http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/215/ponywithbackgrounds.png/

Ah, I see.
yamichan: as i said very silly attempt at it and its hardly that good for making a OC but it gives you a idea
OC is OC.
yamichan: Be nicew to other ponies and they will be nice to you.
*nice
I was just being honest. Green and yellow?
And black hair.
lol
Sorry killerpony7733 the link won't load :(
yamichan: a combo of colors that symbolize several things
Well still.,
Either combine bright with the same color but darker.
or two bright colours that reflect eachother
Phase4: can u recommend a good torrent site thats not google for movies?
yamichan: Just try and be nice. My OC Pegasus, Colt, Dark Blue, Golden mane, Dark red eyes, Cutie mark just like RD's but My lightingbolt is golden. :)
Im being nice. xD
Give me the link to the OC pony creator.
I wanna give it a shot lol
yamichan: I'm just trying to help. Are you new here?
yamichan: ill send a PM
thanks.
Ponies, this is the internet dont take anything seriously, especially insults as they're jokes more than half of the time.
no offense
Good afternoon Bronystate! :)
MadSurge: afternoon ;)
Hello there, MadSurge. :)

Me and Rainbow--Dash share the account why'd she get to name it D:

/me yawns "Well guys, time to call it a night. I'll see you all later, night :)"

No, all the rules are the same pretty much everywhere.
There's no reason to.

Cypresswolf take care and lol at the vid xD
Bye Cypre....
DANG IT!
lol
:'(
first time on site
who's streaming now?
valoreins|Drawing: howdy! and wrek is
fluttershycanfly: Well then WELCOME! EVERYPONY GET THE CIDER!
IT'S TIME TO PARTY!
fluttershycanfly welcome then !
ohai Sylandest
mmm
lol ty, but today is a wedding day at my house XD
oh we got a new guy here?
I need to coffee p.
fluttershycanfly: welcome to the site! Relax and sit back and enjoy :)
fluttershycanfly: thats nice :)
fluttershycanfly: ahh, congrats to the lucky couple! We wish them well :)
ummm, all im streaming is a vid of a dame
ty ty lol it is my mom's friend
fluttershycanfly: right now, the stream should be playing Doom 3. if its frozen, hit refresh
fluttershycanfly: My real name isn't Ponies47_Breakfest BTW. It's just Ponies47 I'm eating breakfest right now :P
oh well going back to drawing again
yum, i should get somthing to eat in a bit, byt why are we watching doom 3?
fluttershycanfly: DOOM3 resurrection of evil
fluttershycanfly: because wrek is currently streaming, and he has chosen to play this. You can pause it if you wish to
fluttershycanfly: The streamer streams what they want. We can't change that.
ah lol, doom always freaked me out, when i was little, my dad would play it and i would watch XD
Or do what I do mute the stream and go on Youtube :P
fluttershycanfly: understandable, hehe. It's changed over the years somewhat
The grabber is such a useful weapon against the flying skulls and imps
well ive only played doom 3 a little, but i saw the movie and wanted to cry, the rock is such a bad actor
Night every one
night, cow334!
I love you all
oh bai cow334
fluttershycanfly: indeed. that one was not a very good video game to movie transition, lol
fluttershycanfly: i played both Doom3 and ROE several times though they are great games on their own despite extreme use of jump scares
Wrek lol smack those skulls with dat flashlight
well what dissapoints me is that bethista sold out, the games are still good, but the movie was aweful and they just wanted money.
Ok done with breakfest! :)
ded
what did u have?
These guys make video games about blowing stuff up. How much integrity does that take?
fluttershycanfly: eggs and buttered toast
Randomnerd: ID were the god of all FPS makers they created the genre :|
This is not some intellectually vigorous exercise.
sounds tasty lol, i should make some eggs, i have some parsley that is about to go bad :P
fluttershycanfly: Then you should :)
Yay, ID.
Randomnerd: back then it was about that it was violence gore and fun thats what people liked about good old Doom
They made Heretic too, didn't they?
Randomnerd: given that "blowing stuff up" is relatively acceptable in the media of society to begin with, I doubt its a realistic scale of integrity
killerpony7733: I'm old enough (too old) to know how important Doom was for the genre. Making a shitty movie doesn't mean they fell very far.
but how can i eat when there are ponies to be watched?!
Randomnerd: techinally ID allowed it but i think they actually regret it
NullRadix: That's what I'm saying. They made low-brow entertainment.
<_<
112
...
But it wasn't anything out of social norms. You aren't sacrificing integrity there
We're all here by our mutual adoration of a show that sells toys. What makes it awesome is how it transcends it.
and really, lets face it, most of us would think "Doom movie? awesome!" before we saw it
Like Super Mario bros movie
or Metroid movie
Or Max Payn movie.
That's what I mean... They didn't sell out, they were already mainstream and consumerist
Just kidding, there isn't one.
Randomnerd: doom for me atleast is what a fps should be not some boring on rails shooter like COD :|
lol cant stand cod
maybe I misinterpreted something *shrug*
killerpony7733: That's fine. Like I said, it's cool in how it transcends its origin.
well everypony i have to go
bye bye all
You know my brother got all of the COD games and he hasen't played ANY of them. :P
Bye, RainBowJack
goodluck out there RainBowJack
Laterz RainBowJack :)
Randomnerd: yeah COD has in some way just ruined what a FPS was lack of different enemies etc etc so many things done wrong and overhyped
good luck in the realworld you mean?
My brother is a real video game nut
Ponies47: and he still doesn't like ponies?
yeah. Its dangerous business going out your door
Oh hey VioletVanilla.
killerpony7733: Exactly. It is a commercial enterprise that aspires to accomplish nothing but make money.
06DashWithRainbows!! <3
<3
VioletVanilla!
<3
06Congratulations so much on becoming our helpful artist! (:
You can make money and do something meaningful simultaeneously, it's just harder.
06WallDives~ c;
hi VioletVanilla
/me hugs WallDives und CCCP
Hi, VioletVanilla
Hello Violetmod
oh hai VioletVanilla
:D
Randomnerd: as Wrek said once get businessmen out of the game industry
de best poni evar.
killerpony7733: I suppose Wrek has a point.
CCCP: No. We were in the same room for like 4 hours 2 nights ago. I didn't show him ponies because my dad was doing a Skype call and he was getting mad because he couldn't play his video games. :|
/me giggles
Ponies47: awww
06You ponies are too silly~
Ded.
Hey VioletVanilla! :)
06How ist everypony? o:
Randomnerd: oh and publisher/developer bindings just has to end EA is the core example of binding a developers to a horrible contract that forces them to make rushed games etc
Good. Good.
VioletVanilla Thanks a lot! I'm still amazed that I was accepted.
Ohai Ninjazz.
howdy, VioletVanilla1 I'm fixing breakfast at the moment. Would you like some?
Randomnerd: publishers should never have the power to tell a developer studio to make what the publisher wants never
Hey, Malavolent! :)
Still sane?
:D
CCCP: Yeah. Next time. I just wish I could make him sit down and watch a whole episode from start to finsh
/me smiles at Sylandest
Ninjazz: More or less :P
Ponies47: only if he wants to
Hey VioletVanilla :)
06Almost 16:00 here, aber I would love some food <3
Malavolent: Good to hear. :D
VioletVanilla: well, at the moment, I have only cereal and bacon...but I can prepare something else if you would like! :)
Wrek hold the heart over that guy it absorbs him
brb
VioletVanilla: So you are from Germany after all.
06Do not go out of your way for me sweetie ><; I will eat as you do. . I am not a royal pony after all. . .
Ninjazz: How have you been lately?
VioletVanilla: But you are best pony ever!
killerpony7733: I'm only vaugely familiar with the abusive relationship gamers have with EA
06Malavolent: jaaaa c:
CCCP: Not gonna force. Maybe 1 day when he's so bored maybe he'll just watching anything so he won't be so bored. Or I could derp up his PS3. :P
VioletVanilla: maybe so, but you are my guest, and deserve proper treatment as such! :)
killerpony7733: EA makes CoD, yes?
Malavolent: This week has been pretty hard, but good at the moment. :)
Ninjazz: Likewise, I've finally finished my exams so I can relax for a while :D
Randomnerd: activision does or well they publish it but its their series which they use as a cash cow but i damn the fact big time publishers has so much power over a developers to actually tell them what to do instead of the developer making a game they really want and not being stopped by restrictions
03well
03that was the most rediculous exam ever
03definitely failed it
Hiya guys what's up?
oh hey otakon17.
howdy otakon17!
Malavolent: Good to hear. Enjoy the time you get! :)
03I even went to the bathroom halfway through and got my phone out and started looking up stuff
/me runs
Hey ther, otakon17. :)
happy morning time otakon17
Hey otakon17 :)
Lol indeed, anything on?
I finally listend to some tenacious D
killerpony7733: So the Gatekeepers stick to what works, even when it becomes tired. It's like that in book publishing, now.
dr-whooves: aaaand?
Hello dr-whooves
I:me gusta:
dr-whooves: :D
13[14:01:52:652] "new TEamviewer App for the New iPad and Android Ice Cream Sandwich" <-- got a email saying that from teamviewr this morning, drf :D
Hey, otakon17
03I've had the TeamViewer app for like a year now LOL
Randomnerd: as Wrek said businessmen they stick to a formular that makes money and have a huge gun pointed at the developers to force them to make games that makes them money despite rushing lack of real quality etc
Ninjazz: I'm going to! :D Looking forward to summer break. How long is the summer break in the US anyway?
13dat name, for that android thingie
13wut?
Malavolent: it tends to last from 2-3 months
14I have that app too :D
03um,what?
Randomnerd: and ambition
13Android Ice Cream Sandvich
Malavolent: It depends from school to school, but it's usually 2-3 months.
killerpony7733: good thing companies like Valve exist
03oh
13i love that name
03yeah I think it's stupid too
03or that
03:P
Sylandest: So it's almost the same, we've got 2 months.
As Sylandest kindly pointed.
Malavolent: eeyup
But damn, 3 months of free time.
killerpony7733: Aha. Is this worse for console gaming?
Ninjazz: :$
I envy you.
08,01my god
08,01german food
/me 08,01is hungry
08,01Malavolent: and doner kebap
08,01Randomnerd: it's the best thing
MadSurge: yup they got the right idea of free relations between a publisher and developer they just publish and no more but valve is a publisher/developer hybrid company though
08,01leberkase!
brb
08,01leberkase + rottkohl
08,01only think i don't like is german bread
08,01it's all rye based

08,01Sylandest: it does
/me 08,01is a bit of a foodie
It's not the same as the real deal, of course, but I cannot travel to Germany.
killerpony7733: it's still nice to see there's people willing to support indipendent publishers/quality original games :)
08,01Sylandest: together?
Legens says that the small country next to Germany has the best beer in the whole world!
mmm, bacon cereal.
08,01because cereal wrapped with bacon actually sounds pretty good
I cannot fund a trip to my friends upstate, never mind visit a country across an ocean.
Randomnerd: actually it isn't bad with console gaming it has annoyed PC gamers that so many horrible ports are made but the idea of consoles are fine its cheaper for people with maybe a bit less money but again publishers know money is at consoles sadly
Anything wrapped in bacon sounds delicious.
06Sylandest~
VioletVanilla! :D
08,01MadSurge: i like basketball and maths!

He's like 6'2"
killerpony7733: Yes, I played up to C&C Red Alert 2.
06C&C <3
Otakon: mostly the same height as my bro then :D
Randomnerd: never get C&C 4 god that game is the pure example of how EA just ruins a developer and a series
Huray for partial understanding of german!
killerpony7733: Okay, I'll avoid it like the plague.
best kebap: Berlin, S-Bahn-Station Jannowitzbrücke
döner is dirt cheap here, too
Randomnerd: but for research watch a playthrough and watch how horrible it is

Wrek: stream now
Hey everypony
Wrek: Im on NA, sorry
hey Red_Pegasus hows your day been
14o.o
11,01You'd think Blizzard would allow you to transfer characters across regions.
11,01Or servers.
alexxm: Just begun:)
Nittany_Discord: No, see, blizzard hates everyone.
Nittany_Discord no, they hate that, the same in WoW since allways
hey anypony want to start some new hardcore toons on the NA server?
10http://www.decal.org/courses/2041
Nittany_Discord: maybe in the future, after you pay them to do so
Nittany_Discord: If they did, they'd probably charge you like $20 a character for it.
11,01Blizzard loves investors.
Nittany_Discord: you'd probably have to result in paying for it
11,01So they don't hate everyone.
Nittany_Discord: Fair enough.
more or less
14LOL
The challenge is accpected I'm stay up for 48 hours OR MORE! *Laughs like a crazy nut job*
Yay done with the survey for the kickstarter i pledged to <3
11,01Investors need to GTFO of gaming.
which is another reason I play single server games (EVE) :p
Blizzard loves gold spammers too...
Nittany_Discord: /)
10I WANNA MOVE THERE
11,01(\
o/
RoboGerbil: Gold Farmers are probably blizzard employees
Nittany_Discord: Without them we would not have as many games, unfortunately
^
11,01We would still have games.
lawl
that's
kinda amazing
Nittany_Discord: But money!
not as much tho
brb DINNER!
13LOL is that serious
Nittany_Discord: We would have games, yes, but investors are an important part of game development. A LOT of games would not get the green light without investors.
11,01What we may not have is bad DLC policies and draconian DRM.
Lil_B: What you eating?
Lil_B: DINNER! :D
Lil_B: Chew slowly!
10Yes
13do want
sagas i tell you when i come back
I want that class
f*** drexel
well every gaming business is that, a business, what sets companies apart is how well they treat thier customers :)
I'm going to DeCal
/me hides
Nittany_Discord: sure, but investors help out companies that want to make a impact on the gaming world
10I'd *teach* the class
XD!
You would! :P
10after I took the course
Well what about battle strategies :U
Good thing the weekend is here. *eye twitchs* gives me plenty of time to stay up!!!! *ear twitchs*
11,01Good impacts?
11,01I only see bad.
Nittany_Discord: Unfortunately, I am a comp sci major focused specifically i ngame programming, so I have had a lot of this drummed into my head.
Nittany_Discord: *cough*EA*cough*
10inb4 full of Asians/nerdy white boys </stereotype>
Nittany_Discord: You only SEE the bad but without investors you would see a LOT less games.
/me noms Skylands >:U
Anyone remember Interplay?
/me nom'd
Well
11,01The bad is loud.
companies like EA, Blizzard, etc. are lately (relatively) treating all thier customers as criminals, alot of the indy companies ackknowledge that you wont stop piracy, and some companies actually talk with thier customers
Nittany_Discord: But money! So your argument is invalid
11,01So, yeah.
A black kid came up to me once and claimed he had more Pokémon cards than me
then again he was a tool (I'm not even kidding ;-;)

Nittany_Discord: Games dont happen without lots of money. Something investors bring
11,01Maybe there are public companies that listen to consumers.
His friends told him to do that so they could lol at him
Nittany_Discord: not all investors are bad
Sumi stream incoming.

00,10CCP belives if every one is unhappy then the game is balenced

DUST isnt a bad concept tbt

tbh
Night Kriel_Pony

11,01Nice guy. Holds stock in Activision. Could care less about Activision's franchise milking.
/me does what i want

not really
Sumica: see Monocle-gate :)
is this a tokusatsu anime
10This is what I found http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_loz57zHhQ01qjzx9h.jpg
10also, language
14lol
the problem is really, people hate change
so anyone want to start some ahrdcore mode in diablo 3?
14bath y u fill so slow
no matter what game, if something changes, people are gonna whine and bitch and moan about it
WoW, EVE, SWG, etc
god Diablo 3 got boring pretty fast
Oh, fuck. I'm not applying for a job working for a collection service.
10You take baths?
11,01My only fear is that more and more games are going to try always-on DRM after D3.
11,01Even after Ubisoft ditched it because it failed miserably.
well... there are... ways to get around it
Nittany_Discord: DRM?
Sorry for the profanity, folks. This job hunt has been torture.
Digital Rights Management
Nittany_Discord: one thing i want gone is the extreme publisher/developer contracts the fact publishers can just control a developer and drain them of all the ambition and quality etc they just restrict developers like hell telling them what to make :|
11,01Randomnerd: I feel your pain.
Nittany_Discord: so are you talking about EA?
lolded?
RyunosukeKnT not d3 yet unfortunately
13I don't
which is why i still havnt bought that game
13I take showers :3c
Don't buck with SunRed.
so this show is a piss take of kamen rider
10Same here
11,01No, Ubisoft.
11,01Anyway.
Nittany_Discord: Ubisoft is nice
HA! My brother pulled an all nighter as well playing video games. Now he's sleeping. *Eye twitchs* The poor sucker I'll stay up much later MUCH LATER!
13plus we don't even have a bath anymore xD
Ubisoft abandoned it after AC3(?) and thier servers failed for like 3 weeks
11,01Ubisoft devs admitted to hating PC gamers.
10Ours is both
people were pissed
14I take both, Skylands
11,01Ubisoft is a stupid company.
10We have just a tub in the basement though
10With water jets, almost like a jacuzzi
14I'm not in a hurry and I really want to relax atm, so I'm taking a bath x3
10I see, Viri
Nittany_Discord: B-b-b-but...they made Rayman!
WHAT IS THIS PLACE? FULL OF SO MAN--- oh Morning B-state :D
11,01They made the worst DRM in existence and said that it worked after it caused a 90% drop in PC sales.
ive never liked ubi
Panda: howdy! good afternoon! :)
hey Panda what have you been up to
wait, they caused a 90% drop in PC sales?
what?
no
After
alexxm: well i just work up and now im drawing :)
Sylandest: afternoon? XD its 10 am :)
HIIIIIIIII Panda! *ear twitchs* I HAVE BEEN UP FOR OVER 20 HOURS! *Eye twitchs*
Panda: its noon where I am, lol
13Are baths with water jets and large houses a normal thing to have in the US? :'D
Whut is the stream showing? O.o
Piracy is the reason why pc game sales are dropping
13cuz only rich people here have those LOL
11,01Randomnerd: I'm having a fruitless job search myself. I also have to move out of my apt soon and currently have no help.
/me glomps Ponies47
so does this guy ever take off his mask
11,01No, it's not Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
10Uh, Idk
Ponies47: you challenging yourself?
/me sits upon Nittany_Discord
11,01Steam is doing great.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: um... no its not... its stilll alive and strong :)
Nittany_Discord: I'm sorry to hear that :( I was lucky, I landed back with my family.
14brb
Panda: Yes. I have challenged to stay up 48 hour or MORE! *Eye twitchs*
This anime is trippy :D
1) PC sales arent really... thing, most people upgrade thier current PC's rather than buying a new one every other year, unlike consoles (ps2 -> ps3. Xbox -> 360) etc
11,01I will move back home.
11,01But I have no help moving.
/me appears
10My house isn't big at all. It is what's known as a "ranch"
howdy, GrimGallop!
10A ground floor and basement
Unfortunately thta makes me feel worse -I'd rather have a job.
hai GrimGallop
Greetings, Sylandest
meowmeow
And Jim
hey GrimGallop hows yoru day been
Panda: ya sure its still strong, but piracy has a bad impact on pc games
Eviltastic.
11,01Ubi's PC sales dropped because of their DRM. People couldn't play their games because they had to stay constantly connected to play it.
11,01And only a few people can even with broadband.
I have a showertub and a jacuzzi aswell
Curse you, Minecraft. I keep trying to press t to talk -_-
i gotta buy minecraft soon
I have a ground floor, top floor, and basement
10Mom doesn't remember how much the jet tub costed
Hrm
11,01Making your product unplayable or restricting it to when and where you play it doesn't make it attractive.
the minecraft tablet port kinda sux
05Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: you should have ages ago, it just got more expensive as time went
10but dad did the labour to put it in, so it'd cost less
GrimGallop: Can't you change that in the options?
AE it's what I'd call uncommon
:U
hi Wrek
I don't know, I haven't tried o.o
/me snug
Wrek: I just found out that you are swedish :)
Wrek how much was it for you when you brought it?
to me, its more like treating customers and potential customers like criminals from the outset rather than working around the problem that irks me
05Panda: such a feat
11,01Piracy has a bad impact everywhere.
^
Wrek: :( I love your sarcasm XD
11,01There's console game piracy as well.
Panda: HIlows Panda
^
Om: oh you're up?
Panda: Still!
10Where ur script go
piracy doesnt happen as often as the corporations say
Woot. Victory is mine. Thanks for that, Jim XD
10!pokemon
Skylands, you are a 6Genesect.
tbh, without console piracy, Wii and PS3 wouldnt have thier respective channels and in system consoles
Om: :) so you and Ponies47 are dueling or something?
anyone here nameded daniel
Nittany_Discord: PC piracy has been used as a stupid excuse to switch to consoles and not make a PC port of a game
if the games good enough most pirates buy it anyway
^
RyunosukeKnT: thats a good point
not to make*
Panda: No, I just forgot to sleep
11,01But fighting piracy by punishing everyone doesn't always work especially when you make the product very unplayable.
10Pokémon matches its font colour </random observation>
Om: XD
Panda: Nope.avi. *Eye twitchs*
13!pokemon
13<3
Ponies47: :) you should get some sleep
13!touhou
Nittany_Discord AND it doesnt affect pirates anyway
13!touhou
Nittany_Discord, may I ask you a question?
13l
Nittany_Discord: publishers always see more mony in consoles compared to PC's
13*k
you only punish legit users
that is true Nittany_Discord , remember Darkstar one, was a great game, but... I had to pirate the german version and English patch it just to play it :(
Money*
hi
hi freak1234
That feel when you haven't updated your Xbox360 and still have that old menu
hey freak1234 hows your day been
11,01And like with some people I know, bad DRM can make piracy the only available option to play the game.
CrimsonPhoenix NICE
i do miss the blades
hi freak1234
08,01piracy is good for the industry
though it's not the folder ones
Panda: It's 12:00 PM plus why sleep when I can be awake! *ear twitchs*
08,01and i have several studies to back that up
but that one that introduce those avatars
Darkstar one was a great game, good story, good controls, but the DRM made the US version practically unplayable
Hi everypony! I'm back :)
hi ThunderCloud
welcome back, ThunderCloud
11,01Bad DRM can /increase/ piracy.
Ponies47: wait... you are in the same timezone as me?
hi ThunderCloud
08,01Nittany_Discord: *all* DRM increases piracy

Ponies47: i mean wait... nvm, too early for me
Yukari, you are a 12Nuzleaf.

hey ThunderCloud hows your day been
11,01Even CD keys?
13that's awesome, my connection's never been that good before LOL
this show is werid
Nittany_Discord: CD keys can be cracked, i know because i have done that before XD
I HAVE BEEN UP FOR 22 HOURS NOW!
Nittany_Discord: if it limits the game to a certain number of installations, yes
kongarra~
alexxm finished my exam, so I'm pretty great :)
08,01Nittany_Discord: i don't really see CD keys as DRM, because they're so easy to bypass
Yes, for example if you have bought the game, and lose your cd key later
alexxm its trippy i'll give it that :D
08,01but, i suppose that if i did, i'd say yes
12!swearcount
11,01RyunosukeKnT: That is bullshit I wasn't aware of for a while.
10!lag
12how´s the command to count his swears?
12!lag
[Skylands] Lag with ocean.lugia.us is 2.044secs
08,01anything that puts a barrier between the user and playing a game increases piracy
08,01i own a copy of Starcraft and Broodwar
12!lag
[MysticLugia] Lag with ocean.lugia.us is 0.109secs
08,01and at one point, i wanted to play it, but couldn't find the key
Dan vs!
Dat Dan vs,
YES! Dan vs!
10That's terrible
08,01so i torrented it
/me owns multiple adobe programs~
Arrg.

08,01now, techincally, the legality of this is a grey area

12!help
PINKIE PIIIIE!
so what does dan want vengenace against this time
12okay, someone say me the command to check the swearcounter?
YES! *eye twitchs*'
alexxm: We shal see.
08,01since the EULA states that the license is for running the game, not being in posession of the executable code
10Don't know
08,01then again, you're not allowed to copy and distribute the executable code
... now I feel bad
haven't checked it in a while

Bronysith: :O I see the resemblance!
12there was a planned anime which got cancelled
00,10I only know.........1 way
11,01You know, the PS3 stayed unpirated for a long time. It's party because they allowed people to install OtherOS. When Sony took that out in their knee-jerk idiot reaction, the PS3 hackers swarmed and cracked the system.
12an official one
uh
4back
13there's a second episode in production
13:P
lol
So hatesful!
02Wb

Good Will vs the Salvation Army. Would be a really good war
08,01[18:08:56 BST] Ruth [SlightlyEccentric]: so your favourite fanfic is "is this pg?"?

This is more like an adult's show.
12so you know about the earthbound version of Touhou?

Brony Movie Night, GreeHetBronyInDuitsl
Young adults.
Cool

I love this show and everything that it comes with.
11,01And told everyone.
Congrats MadSurge!

This show deserves just as much love as MLP just for the sheer awesomeness of it.
what do you mean MadSurge
Dat Trojan Horse reference!
Genius!
lawl
Sumica: how is this a kids show?

This show needs to be on Cartoon Network for those of us who don't have HUB
I tend to become very knowledgeable about fandoms I like
Ninjazz: agreed
Bronysith its more like for teens
Sylandest: (\
It's deceptively heavy... and misanthropic.
Ninjazz: /) :)
alexxm: I helped my dad defrost our horribly ice encrusted second fridge

Nittany_Discord: Are you sure the kidneys are your own, and not someone elses?
Boun-dar-ies?

Sumica: Dan's got TWO friends?

Those air sirens
DamonLucius: Rule of funny

that gains such an amount of dedicated fans
GrimGallop: I just thought it was a youtube thing....
it's comparable to some of the biggest franchise fanbases
Jim: Beep boop, son, beep boop.
I like Dan vs., it's fun to see such a jerk suffer :D
I'd wtf at my life
you don't have to do anything special for a living

Censorship, Panda. It fixes everything.
Sylandest: Go out to eat tonight.
Oh no, someone's censored butt was seen. Now it can't be a kid's show anymore!
that's why we ignore him for the most part lol
I hate political correctness so much.
:O
Ok, I love the way kids shows are if this is the future of kids shows
granted
13I didn't know what Homestuck was until Rawra brought it up about a week or so ago :'3
Hey, Lasharus!
GrimGallop: so if ponies cursed... but it was censored it would be ok?
Panda: besides kids laugh at butts :D

Stream my little pony friendship is magic!
I don't clop to ponies. :P
Lil_B|Paint: success!
I read that as angle
Wrek XD
I hate math.
05no one said it was to ponies dude
05jeez
Lil_B|Paint that is just an illusion :D
14that's more of geometry
inb4 telling a girl she's acute angle
/me is not angular D:
RainMaid: well... when you have a gf, who needs clopping XD
14LOL
MadSurge, maybe not ponies, but in general, Im sure you do
12"Crackle Sweepstakes: Enter for a chance to win a VIP trip to Sony Pictures Studios and other XBOX prizes"
I clop to Dolan
Sylandest this was a Triumph, I'm making a note here, huge success
You can clop to anything else than ponies?
geometry = math
OKAY JUST STOP
I swear this is the most awkward conversation I have ever heard here :D -lol-
Wrek: i know ^^ Im just kidding
12I can see 2 major problems with that O-o
>Microsoft
11,01I'll pick up on Dan Vs. wherever Sumica left off.
>Sony
we do NOT need examples of what you clop to dammit
is the stream over
Yeah it is very akward...
Invi it IS... how can i be certain that you are seeing the same as I?
12exactly
11,01Probably Dan Vs. The Beach.
can I stop at Nintendo too? :d
/me 08,01is watching Dan Vs.
12Sony, first of all
alexxm: well, Sumica was having net issues atm
I clop to the My Body is Ready song
chat is getting awkward fast
08,01but i'm watching it locally, not on the stream
Dan vs Dan
nothing awkward about something everyone does :|
12and then it says "OTHER prizes"
thanks otakon
RainMaid: who doesn't, except extremely religious people?
08,01my god, it's pretty much my favourite thing ever
00,10well I think i was, I am not sure
I can take two bombs with me and literally kill two birds with one stone :D
/me runs
RainMaid: i know ^^

Alister: :O Wut
12so Sony is a giant XBOX now...

RainMaid: except you know, WE DON'T NEED TO HEAR ABOUT IT
11,01I'd like to see S2 of Dan Vs.
MegaMoonShine: You do too ! I know it !
14I don't believe contests anymore since Panasonic cancelled their new console
/me 11,01hugs RainMaid

14and, of course, the contest
08,01oooh, there's a season 2?
05except you know otakon. those that make major taboo out of it arent contributing
otakon: yep
LOL WHAT PANASONIC
08,01alexxm: but actually funny
14you could have met the mascotte
14Dx
14drf, 1-2 years ago
Wrek: exactly
Panasonic makes the best TVs but o.o
14when people were talking about 3DS and PSV
Wrek brilliant deduction :)
MadSurge, people who are 10ish or lieing
11,01Tell me if it's streaming properly.
FINALLY!
Lil_B|Paint well, you can never be sure since you have to be me to experience my point of view 100% accurate (but srsly, it worked. I was jk :P)
14Panasonic said "let's make The Jungle!"
14then "LOL JK"
Maid_Discord: Perfectly.
14:(
inb4 Panaphonics and Magnetbox
12ohai Aero

12hmm?

Want to hear a "so dumb it's funny" commercial I heard?

Does somebody has something like a Black Vector Pony?
BEEEAAAAAAACCHHHHHHH :D
12k o.o
otakon: yes
and his car is ALWAYS getting torn up
otakon he relases at the best time
08,01are we seriously talking about jerking off, or is there just a lot of innuendo going around here?
Lil_B|Paint /)
Blank*
..WAt

it's a company that repairs air conditioners
Invi [\
05someone made a big deal out of it
05etc etc
'we have the coolest customers'
05typical day on the internet eh?
Speaking of that.... Does RP count as ?
08,01indeed
Wrek wait... it wasnt me was it? :(
Panda: no no, it wasnt you
Wrek: eeyup, cue the "SOMEONE WAS WRONG ON THE INTERNET" comic
Alister depends if you do something after that
08,01Iron_Maid: do ho ho

14the mom looks at the daughter's tatoo and says "what? What's that?? What were you thinking??"
08,01"clopping" is the new "yiffing", isn't it?
At the Euro movie night,do you accept french movies too?
Panda: ah, good to hear and BUFFER
