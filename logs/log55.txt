I downloaded that the other day but hasn't played it yet
oh yeah
have you done the divs as well?
12No actually, that's low priority at the moment since the profiles have to be redesigned a bit
12Different stylesheet,.
well, shouldn't be that hard
12It's just different names I guess
6I bbl
6I have a doctor's appointment
6and then I can finally start working on PLUSH
6woot
Profile Visitors 4.1 works with SMF 2 iirc
12It doesn't seem to LOL
you need to edit one or two things
one sec
12I have
night
nvm, find it
not where?
12The package manager cannot find the lines needed to add the mods in
12and 0.9.1

12wtf
12Why? LOL

I can give you my files
I know they work because they work
12it's ok, I found 4.0
took me ages to find it
12lol
124.0 does not work for SMF 2...
try it
12Basically none of the lines it tries to find are there
o_O
that's not nice
12and there are a LOT of entries it needs to add
4.1 doesn't work on SMF 1.1.x
which file is it having issues with?
12Which? 4.1? Profile.php (but I just found the line, it's very slightly different)
I'll check 4.0
which line is it?
12Themes/default/Profile.template.php
12Ot
12It's fine, that one is done now

We use DAB /or/ some other thing
depends on the country.
here it's dab.
I know of that one
also known as Eureka 147
not a bad system
14xD
I find analogue radio interesting
because Eureka DAB requires a separate band
but I've no equipment nor any knowledge/experience.
14Say apple.
*jums*
*JUMPS
the list goes on and on
plus HOW MANY COUNTRY STATIONS DOES ONE FREAKING CITY NEED

I got my hated device before Verizon had fantastic 3G service
and Verizon required me to add a little weird antenna
03Verizon has always had good 3G service :P
14Got irritating seeing him dramatically die like 50 times
yea
no kidding
and in NYC
and Seattle
03dunno, I've never had service problems with Verizon
Vodafone here is crap
sometimes 3G, sometimes o
Mmhmm
3G = good, o = blah :\
perhaps it's just Italy
Were getting kpn 3G for my tablet

how do i get the item behind the burned ship before arborick?
03that's called 1X
03or CDMA
03with AT&T it would be GSM<
It shows up as o
03not for me
next to Vodafone is either 3G or o
nvm
'ello, Minnet.
03here you either have 3G or you don't
14oh
14x.x
14I was about to say
here, you'll either have 3G, o, or the very rare No Service
arborick
o? o.O
oi
mostly when going through tunnels
I'd have to post a screenshot of it with Vodafone o
14Good luck :3

03nothing is permanent, just wipe the hard drive and start over

19 Euros per month for 3GB of data

a little more expensive than with AT&T, but more usage
permanent damage to the contents, though.
yup
03screw the contents, if it's important enough you should have backups.

03now, I lost some pretty important data, because I had an external hard drive that I dropped which physically broke x.x
juidrtxgfhj
I still don't have backups
03but that had nothing to do with viruses
we've been meaning to set up a server for ages
03we?

I have a backup, but it's probably disorganized
either a plain backup drive, or a raid'ed storage server.

Minnet: what's the time in England - that's.. UTC+1?
blundertails defeated
i'm dreading ravage rider
it is currently 10:34 PM here in Italy
Minnet: what's the time +0200?
tha's Italy (and most of Western Europe).
Italy is the same as the netherlands
...
yes
03LOL Mythbusters, they forgot to blur the Toyota name off the back of this pickup truck they're using in this episode
exactly.
Thats +1
Minnet said 22:35
no
that's 10:35 PM.
Summertime and wintertime
This is timezone +1 not +2
Italy has summertime, yes?
Yup
and it's pretty freakin' hot @_@
then it's +0200.
because UTC is.. well, why don't you ask her?
Minnet: what's the time UTC?
Toyota
The timezone remains the same
we have a Highlander
it good :3
/me random
But the time changes
CET is +0100
CEST is +0200
UTC is UTC, always.
GMT is +0000
LOL that's FAIL Armads xD
Utc is always 0
BST is +0100.
lol
Italy is currently observing daylight saving time, which means their zone is CEST -> +0200.
Hm.....
Timezone is still +1...... but the time is +2......
...
/me likes this talk about Italy :D
i take that back
they -change- timezones during summer
he was easy
CET is always +0100
but during summer, Italy enters CEST.
luna
as do most of Western Europe.
including Norway, where I live, and where the time is the exact same.
.hm.......
Then i think i made a lkttle mistake... XD
anyone know how to beat the executioner?
would seem like it.
Heh
hello?

I LIVE in San Diego, and this is the FIRST year I didn't plan to go to Comic Con
Aaaaw, sorry to hear that Val. It always works out like that
Though I never knew of the uncensored one
of *course* the year I decide to not go, something I'd actually WANT appears

lol, I'm *STILL* a member of the L4D2 boycott, and have still never played it
xD
well, I only just got on lol
9but Val, the reasons for making a sequel were understandable
10Ascendant :D
/me glomps
9plus they still release DLC for L4D1
06:3
9Valve didn't go uberdick
9UNLIKE CAPCOM
/me hugs

But they probably won't make a L4D3
9yeah we did
I thought it was always out, Val.
o rly?
9or at least L4D Authoring tools
The movie maker is on the pipeline though.
9you should get L4D2 now
not before L4D2 it wasn't
9plus they keep releasing Free DLC
I've already got L4D2. Haven't gotten any friends playing with though.
I'd have to play 1 again and see if the changes are worthwhile
9if a company should be Boycotted
9that'd be Capcom
lol
9that's nothing
9compared to their other assorted bullshit
9dude there are CAPCOM HATE GENERALS in /v/ right now

4So did I die?

Of course
because that would be a situation for Ms. Inductor that megahertz
guess it isn't a busy livestream today, huh. not many peeps here
I guess that one went over everyone's head
03nah, I got it
03I'm just busy writing notes
Shall I relay that information?
Well that was a refreshing round of Killing Floor.
03LMAO
03I swear there's some site you guys are getting these all from
I figured you would get that drf
O.o
not here either
i had to do it over again
6:O
6Yeah,I remember that from earlier :P
This conversation is fluxing out of control x.x
Ouch
*bawww*
yep i beat it now
03LOL
now i just have to level up
should I relay the meaning to you?
again
6._.
03...OMG
03my teacher just said "we'd have a smaller log"
03I immediately thought IRC
i didn't fully level up the 1st time
03:x
Lolwhat
XD
Haha
03even though he means logarythms
03or whatever the spellin gis
03log(x)
Logaree :)
yes
03then you have ln(x) or natural log
Yes.
Why do you refuse to break up
Ouch.
:p
03-l
6I really ought to play it again..I barely remember anything.. :P
OH LORD
lol
12going to play 360 with BL
12BBL
Lolbai
03alright :<
GHOSTIIIIEEEESSSSS
Or something
DAZ SUPPORTS YOU ALL THE WAY DO IT
no
DRF is the base
He belongs to us?
Shame
or maybe you have too much of a bias current
Did he died?
Aren't there any more direct ways to think?
Or is this all alternative speak
:<
we all died
HE DOIN IT MAN
just go with the flow
I hope there isn't a leak somewhere
yep it would be a very open situation
SUDDENLY KARMA CHARGER
I suggest we switch and close the contact
03OK I think this discussion has gained way too much current
XD
Sure
KUHnife
03and nowhere near as good as thinking of puns as you two
03hm
03my laptop says 35 minutes of battery remaining
6Do you play Sims?
DRF's mind has variable resistance on this :<
03turning the backlight brightness down to half actually made it last quite a bit longer o.o
Aha
03I generally keep it all the way up when it's plugged in
good job jeremy
03now my desktop, on the other hand, those are LED backlit and it's literally like STARING INTO THE SUN
03I have the brightness at 25%
drf i have my laptop plugged in most of the time
03so do I
03hence why I don't mind that it has a crappy battery
if it's not it's to sit downstairs in the not heat
I swear, installing XP updates to this thinkpad R40 (15GB HDD) is slow as anything x.x
03but all the plug outlets in this classroom are along the wall and I'm sitting in the smack dab middle of the classroom. LOL
03HML
03you know why?
Why? :p
03it slos everything down
03*slows
yeah XD
03so installing programs etc
But blah
maybe too much of the power is being reflected back toward him
03hence why I download everything to EXTERNAL hard drives
03now, if you had a solid state...
XD
he might need a Killroy
|___|_| |_| |____/ \___/|_| \_\_____|____/
XD
03well, 64GB can hold the actual OS but I have like 200GB of programs, I kid you not
03so that...still doesn't really work
the giggling gives him powah
looks horrible on non-fixed width font
D:
3 years
XD
/me lurks
03by then I'll already have a couple petabytes
/me hides
maybe longer
not really
lol
Hi.
i play animal crossing
/me explodes
add an apostrophe pls
in 10-15 years
how do you do actions?
/me
We'll be able to do SSD RAID
yea, /me, followed by whatever you want
03...
03you already can
thanks
Let me guess
Yes
12hi player :)
03and then showed how hardcore they are
I only exploded once.
I saw that
XD
03jumped up and down on a trampoline
03while holding the
03m
03it was awesome
12:)
I am surprised they could afford them
XD
/me yanws
03to show off their own hard drives
03you'd assume the manufacturer can afford their own products LOL
I see things twice >_<
hello
Maybe XD
once in Killing floor, another time in livestream, as it's about 5 seconds behind lol
but 25 sata ports?
did they die by themselves?
8ghosties killed them with his mind
03oh, that
03well
03you can get like 4-port SATA RAID cards for pretty cheap
03so just figure
03then RAID0 those all together using hte motherboard
03:P
You're back on KF? Is there a slot on the server?
They're alive!
03I mean, if it wasn't SSD that would be a HUGE Trap
hey i g2g
ttyl
uh oh
Did you died already?
have a pleasant evening
Hello fragents XD
fllipping FleshPound : /
*fragmenta
sprsonmonj'
Bah
Pro-tip: Zombies can kill you.
Or whatever happens to said data XD
03no
03it's not that
03basically, say you have 4 hard drives in a RAID0
03you'd have 4TB worth if you have 4 1TB drives, right?
Yes
At least... I think they can...
03say one of those 4 hard drives die
03not only do you lose that 1TB
Of course :P
03you lose all 4
Ouch o.o
03and it's 100% impossible to ever recover that data, because of how RAID0 stores it.
03so yeah
I'd rather have a RAID3 array
i think
03I'd only ever do a RAID0 if it was totally not important data, and in that case why even bother?
it's the one where if any one drive fails it's not catastrophic
03yeah
03you're thinking of RAID5, i think.
you just lose the capacity of one
035 2TB drives that give me 8TB of storage
n-1
03and one of them is for backup
oh
probably
03well
yeah
03from my understanding it's basically the same thing as 5
03it just stores the data different
it's probably lower or higher level
03prolly
03RAID5 takes a sum.
as in clusters/bits etc.
yes, yes they can. And they did : /
03and keeps either a 0 or a 1 on the last drive, as the sum of the bits on the rest
03if that makes sense
\___/___\___/
|_____|
XD
03my friend explained it to me, it totally makes sense in my mind xD
10o.o
I found that face to be hilarious
03I'd add more hard drives to my RAID5 array but I'm using all of my motherboard's SATA connectors .-.
03well, technically only 11 work which I find dumb
lol
i have an eSATA port on my laptop
same
06Yawn
XD
!espeon
;3
it's eSATA/USB somehow
03yyep
03*yep
03my laptop has that too
o.o
03eSATA is awesome in theory, but I can never get it to work x.x
I have never tried it
Don't have any devices that support it either
i'd like to get an external drive or enclosure that could use it
03I have two
03but see
03what I did
06:3
7Well, now that that's over with, I can finally get to playing piano!

7I don't think we have enough players to populate two servers. XD
12sure we do
12doesn't that make it more interesting?
7If they're on different rotations, sure!
03LOL
sure
03implying I actually abuse my power >_>
It's the easy way, though.
Oh ok then
7Don't take TF2 seriously at all. :P
*raises volume cuz was lowered when on Killing Floor*
12considering the last time i ever saw drf kick someone was like never
03exactly
I might do 13 w/o failures on.
I did 11.
12if anything he doesn't abuse it enough D:
03I've been a super-admin over at HoSHiNET for years and don't think I've ever kicked anyone
03Glacymr can I quote you on that
/me hides
12lol
03I mean
he can. but he doesn't, usually.
03Usually I kill people if they request it
03like when someone doesn't have their nick registered
03and they ping
again, i've seen waay worse
03which happens all too frequently
now split between watch one or other stream
12there is something called ghosting drf
03"Like when someone doesn't have their nick registered"
12oh
03ghosting only works on registered nicks.

03I try to upload a pitcure from my phone and then it randomly loses reception
Of course not. Nothing good ever goes to the UK.
Have you seen the horrible tacky glittery wings on one of the Celestia toys?
I honestly haven't looked at any of the toys before tonight.
If I ever saw one in person, I might be tempted.
Might...?

and last but not least
$35.80
O.O

It's a 2" pony. XD
It costs $2 in Germany apparently.
Though they're supposed to be going to the US sometime (but still nothing for the UK D:)
How much are the brushable ponies in the US?
5 US dollars
comes out to about 7 bucks
Hmm, pretty cheap.
I paid £10 including P+P

long swords
long objects
03LOL
03well
03see
long insects
bee hives
with 100 legs
03my remixes tend to be fairly simplistic
and just because you have a good tool, doesn't mean you know how to use it well
03I basically just rearrange parts of songs
03for In paradise I just chopped out the slow parts and made it all upbeat xD
nah ilu guys ^__^

Thats not remixinng
yes *runs*
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zyf-f1H2KWM This is remixing ;p

Heh
Junh, hence why i said midimixing ;p

03some of them are just taking the swearing out of songs that don't have clean versions
03others are rearranging them

in photoshop, you use the healing/patch/clone tool to "paint over" blemishes. you do a similar thing in audition, if you can spot it out.
12Dammy
03that's because I have a server which seems to bring up tons of hits
12*nn
12you beat me up ;-;
12when i did it
12Light_Latias's bar was higher than drf's
03Arcanine

12sad thing to is they have a really good site
12igoogle is just something i adore
03XD
03well

This Italian theme park website embedded one of my YT videos on their site and said 'A group of American tourists beat us this time!' xD

03*cough*Sony*cough*
XD
03LOL
03wait
03that's why?
Lawl.
12nah
03I thought they just both got hired by Best Buy
03for the ad
03I mean worst buy
/me sighs
03why did I call it by its proper name
12like 90% of the world population would have met him irl
I like Best Buy, just sayin'
12me to
12reward zone~
12too*
Exactly
it's terrible
03<Pattyrick> I like Best Buy, just sayin' <- you must have spare money to throw around then :P
I feel bad for the Italians
03I used to like Best Buy until I realized I can buy things for like half the price elsewhere
03then I was like no
I like their customer service and their selection
not Geek Squad, though
03dude, their customer service is terrible
03LOL
03heck
12i'll say
that's their weak point
03I applied to work for geek squad
03they didn't hire me
/me hides
03well
12lol
03the main thing I hate about Best Buy
12tried to return their blended camera to best buy and they wouldn't take it
03again all comes down to evil business tacits
03*tactics
03if you've ever heard of bait-and-switch scams
Hahaha.
03Best Buy was actually accused of doing that and sued in federal court for it
You are; Geek Squad seems to hire idiots
03Basically, Best Buy sells computers, right
03they put all this crap software on it
03than when you go back to complain
03they charge you to remove the software that they put on in the first place
hmm
03that's my main reason for hating them, as that's just horrible business
Well, my computer is crap
03that, combined with the fact that they're overpriced, it's like NOPE.AVI
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=406jbW2q6H0
I don't think I'll buy a computer from BB, but overall the good experiences I've had there outweigh the bad
12some swearing
03but just about anything else, nah
12that is why best buy is evil
12they wouldn't take that back
03that store is like, the most amazing thing ever
03I swear
yup
I don't
03once you go to Micro cente
03r
03you'll never return to best buy
03you know newegg.com?
03it's like that, only an actual store,.
03you can buy something, open it, use it as a frisbee a few times, reutrn it
03they don;'t care
03*return
03they don't even ask LOL
12o-o
12lol
03from the logo

03LOL
03dude no
12o.o
03NewEgg charges a restocking fee
03they would charge you
03for that
12but you said they would take it back
03I said Micro Center
03not newegg
12oh
03and see, it has to be in somewhat decent condition
12i'll do micro center then
03like you can say it was defective
03you can't blend it
03LOL
12XD
03but see

03then return what's left

Minnet: what's the time +0100?
Minnet: what's the clock in, say, the -0500 timezone?
Minnet time +1200
Minnet: what's the time +1200?
the current time hurrrr in Italy is 12:40 PM
Minnet: what's the time in Italy?
Minnet: what's the current time EDT?
Minnet: what's the current time CET?
lightumbreon: The time is currently 12:09:28 +1, Fri 2011-07-22.
it's 1:09 here
Minnet: reload cmdarray.lua
Minnet: what's the time AZOST?
now gives the zone name instead of the offset when asked by name and not by offset.
also, in order to make that work
I have 37 lines of timezone definitions x.x
Minnet now supports 125 named timezones.
Minnet: reload hacks

I have to use CGI:IRC to get on IRC
else, nothing.
heh
I have a heap of reasons to grass on CGI:IRC
I also use strange ports for irc.
the only server I use 6669 for is ocean.
6697, I mean.
06heya Quan
7Hey, light.
successfully moved over the server
hi Quan =D
and is infinitely more stable
I'm pretty sure the data files were kept
but check just in case
hey :p
7Will do.
xD
how are you?
7Testing out NS's updated server.
7It has glitches. D:
o_O
uh...try again?
7Now it's normal.
7But I have a latency of 100 on the server. O.o
7That's higher than it should be. :P
uh
changelevel
you'll need to go through rcon though
7Ah.
nightshadow@8133-linux-ns ~ $ ping tf2.nightshadow.co.cc
7o.o
7What is neko.crashcraft.co.uk?
it's the reverse DNS of the server
nightshadow@8133-linux-ns ~ $ ping old.crashcraft.co.uk
that's the old server
it's probably because of the location
germany I think
7Huh.
it has a faster download speed though
old one was something like 2mbps
this one has a 100mbps connection, and the first time I tested it downloaded at 10mpbs
nightshadow@neko:~$ uptime
7Okay.
anyway, I can't really move it back because the other server is about to expire
don't want to risk it
I could move it to a US-based server if you really need it
7Hmm...
I have some pretty fast servers in the US
7Put that as a serer?
7server*
uh
7Okay.
7 144 ms.
you could also try 96.126.123.201
they're both US servers
yeah, I'm getting 253 from the first one
214 from the second
but that's considering I'm getting a 300ms one from TST's server :p
7Hmm.
heh
try pinging 85.17.180.107
that's in the netherlands
7 139 ms.
not bad
well, I'll move it if it lags too bad
7It's fine for one person. :P
yeah, ask Xeli
or someone else
/me 7pokes Espeon
but it's not too much work for me to move it, it's just sitting there and waiting for the download to finish lol
7Okay.
7o.o
7Well, I somehow fudged up my TF2 when changing maps.
7My mistake, NS, not yours.
brb
7Hey, lightumbreon.
7Why?

06i'm sorry quan :/
06and gotta go~
7Hey, that's all right.
7Hmm.
ok, there we go. It's downloading an update
7I see you're on, Espeon.
7Ah.
06:P
06kind of where I'm heading :p
06aaaand it connects at least
7o.O
sleeeeeeeeeep
7So apparently, connecting to the server is slow.
7I see you at least connected. :P
06it feels less laggy than it was in the old location at least
I'll get to that tomorrow then
Xeli
it's in germany XD
06awesome:3
lmao
06~
k, I'm in
now just gotta get in the server

Binary just told me he's watching it on TV

Imagine a bomb going off on a crowded rapid transit train here... Eeepage.

06what explosion?!
Oslo, capital of Norway; two bombs just a lil' ago now today.
06ohmai
06i hope no-one was hurt
dammit
deaths confirmed.
06crap
several deaths, count still uncertain; dozens being medically treated; all roads in the area closed
The police is asking people in the area to reduce the mobile phone usage
might've been a carbomb.
prime minister is in safety, but the states of all the ministers are not known.
Sheet.
9REBERAJII
Large areas in the centre of Oslo is being closed off
military police is now helping
06ouch
06who did it?
I'm concerned about this creating more unnecessary islamophobia :/
lightumbreon: no idea.
no one knows.
06yes
Second episode of OOOs tonight?
Islamist extremists suspected.
Because Ep 2 is when things get even more awesome
06i was thinking about al-quaida....atleast, the first thing that popped up in my mind

They're much more interested in OOO right now
Shinkenger is awesome
12However, if I suddenly bork, you’ll know why XD

7well since I killed skype (8gigs of ram / machine from 3months old) my stream has been up all the time

NOOOOOOOO
6My IRC has been working the whole time since I killed skype...
6My stream is still dropping out randomly though. Oo
7hmmm
It's just we get the names from the channel instead of a lottery thread.
But only active names, right?
7older machine then?
Everyone in here. If they're AFK we move on.
Simple enough.
10Vars reset
6After all, active doesn't mean they're not here.
Ehh, I suppose it works
Sure
6It just means they haven't said anything for a bit.

6FAWK
10I'm sure we'll address that if the situation arises :P
@dari win, nice one
I personally could understand not wanting to pick pony episode
Can't you just watch it on one of those online services, like megavideo.
bye then, derma
which one?
...you got about 30 007s, Lolipop, lol
Hello.
6I can't use megavideo here.
I have a list for each one if I get picked for anything
megavideo wont let you watch all the way through anyway
I can hack megavideo anyway.
To make it unlimited.
My A-/B+ movie would be GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE, FEATURING VINCENT PRICE
ummm... how?
7Ohh an easy way?
actually wait
6And then upload it.
1 drink – every time someone says “brother”
1 drink – every time someone rhymes
1 drink – every time someone makes a fist
1 drink – every time someone drinks
1 drink – every time someone says “Anaconda” or you see the word “Anaconda”
NOOOOOOOOOO
6And give me the download link.
10thetrollside: thin ice buddy
lemme check and see if i have it here first
6...XD
Tyranico, I like the way you think.

I cant drink
pick a musical
and ill rape you with a spoon
I figure The Pagemaster would be great to make fun of
Ohh a musical then i would do fiddler on the roof top
shit, i sent all my movies home when i moved out of my apartment
7Dari? Is there an easy way to do that?
dont have it here
That one I'd like to know about
...okay.jpg

Sathi: It's not that easy unless you already have the needed programs set up.

Then it's easy.

Everytime trixie pulls a smug face

6Likely, Lolipop.
6I'm getting set up still...
I'd play, but I don't like drinking by myself.
10thetrollside I have some Hobgoblin, but most likely I won't be drinking buddy

10got modding to do innit
6FAWK
I prefer drinking alone
Oh okay
