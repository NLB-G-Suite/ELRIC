Ok.
Stream's up, quality is as low as possible. >_>
Back
alright play
YAY
Now I cant see anything
/me explodes
wb Patt
You like that quality? :P
all I see is pxels
SIM card problems caused my iPad to not receive 3G 0__o
NO LAG
Looks watchable to me.
>obviously
you know...this episode really didn't get me hooked into the show
REX!
it just felt really forced
REX!!!
YAYA
and...meh...
REX IS YAAAAAAAAAAAAY!
God.Why won't i die?!
>huh, cool
INB4 kid gets eaten
ANOMALY!!!!!!
ohshi
suddenly running?
oh hi
;p
Hahah
Wifi requires no SIM card :P
I have a Brew MP based phone that had a SIM card error
shut up
Eat the kid.
And 3G is terrible
:P
DO EET
No thanks
keep your bias to yourself please
I am simply trying to say something that is actually constructive
I'd rather it eat the protagonists, thus ending the show :P
DON'T SAY THAT VAL
So are my words
ANOMALY!!!!!!
nope
Protagonists die later.
It's created lines and sentences
yours are bashing
You'll have to wait.
eh...the show just doesn't catch my attention
>game of thrones
you just bashed the iPad
and cellular data services
I'm just stating a fact
Dari - still vectorin' RBD pic. Taking FOREVEEEEER.
it kinda bores me tbh
I don't know
those are OPINIONS
3G can be very slow
not facts
4G is fast compared to 3G
when you said "3G is terrible" that is your opinion
not a fact
Fixed; just had to Reinsert it
But you never even got to the predators.
shhh
OH NO A PIXEL MONSTER
And Becker.
3G can be slow compared to Wifi
Becker so awesome.
OH YEAH
lol
My 3G is so
3G has better coverage than WIFI too
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FUTURE PREDATORS.
Well 3G is terrible because it is slow and sometimes the signal gets lost :P
can you get WIFI out on the highway?
BITCHES DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY HORRIBLE MONSTERS
eh...if the first episode can't sell it for me, I don't watch the show
Lawl.
Well I don't think most owners of Wifi have an antenna that big
metimes faster than my Wi-F
The first two episodes of FiM didn't sell it for me.
It seems like a sci-fi soap opera
I'm still gladI continued watching.
06so much black text
Yes
glad I*
well, that's you :P
Hai Espeon
can you get WIFI on ALL busses or ALL trains or ALL vehicles?
13u racist?
/me runs
06pink/purple master race etc, AKA Nope.
Of course not, but Wifi wasn't meant for traveling
/me poofs again
Brb, testing my iPad's SIM card in my dad's iPhone
3G WAS
Wut
what happened?
So when 3G does get out of range, there is a problem
>video stops playing
BLOODY FINGER. HNNNNG SO REAL!
FFFFF
Dari - happens when internet cut off and then joined again
Just stream like 2 seconds ahead of wher u r
honestly
it shud load it
No one needs to be connected all the time
So what's the problem?
Did it stop loading?
Eeyup
My fault.
Dari just click haead so it streams ahead
I was screwing around with the packets it was sending earlier.
then click back so it streams again from ther
Dman, that won't work.
Connection to the server is broked. XD
brb
ok
I'd just like a service that doesn't cut out and require cards to work?
MEAT
Like Patty and his constant disconnects
EAT THE KID
OMNOMNOMNOM
I'm watching vids on YouTube,so i'm afk.
Lol
He kicked it.
OH NO MUSIC
As you know, reptiles HAET music
municipal WIFI fell flat on its face years ago
so sorry
LOL
LIGHTSABER
TESLA LANTERNS DON'T WORK LIKE THAT
DAT LIGHTSABER
you are forced to have cards if you want internet access when you leave your home and are in areas without WIFI
No matter what you choose, the connection will cut out and now that most wifi places are locked, require vertification anywau
Dat mom is a bitch!
4G even moreso, since it hasn't been out for that long
Have you all heard?
PS3 pricecut
But since phones can cut out, what happens when you really need them but the signal can't reach?
Lol PS3
249 euros/dollars now
12o.o
So many pricecuts later
because i'm bored and watching the sony press conference
if you're in the middle of nowhere being chased my murders
No network is going to help you if your cell can't reach it
awww
*murderers
I missed the part where the kid almost dies
have a decent vectorized RD now, lolz
that was the only entertaining part :P
So why'd you be in the middle of nowhere?
Yippee!
The kid escaped.
"the signal can't reach"
Stupid not-dead kid :(
In most cities/towns, you can get cell service anywhere
hence "almost" dies :P
Even if it's not 3G/4G/wifi, you still have enough service for an emergency
so did the black guy get eaten?
rocks 'n things. good description kid
Suuuuuuuuure, blame the telly woman
You hope :P
Never trust wireless period
As there can be a million random events thatr could ruin your connection
like?
They came from the rift in space/time that goes through Cardiff
LOL
LOL
Kinda
Weather, buildings, distance and dead zones
HAHAQHA
much of it is due to the physics of the frequencies used
it begins...
GSM phones typically use three bands
My Little Primeval: Anomalies are Magic
PORTAL 3 STARTS HERE!
800 MHz, 900 MHz, and 1.8 GHz
and then links into a crossover OF EVERY TV SHOW EVAR
You can be right next to the radio station, and still get a bad signal :P
high UHF
I'd love time travel in Portal 3
still haven't played portal 2 actually
like looking through a portal and seeing the past, how ace would that be?
that is due to the signals being very much line of sight
I think CDMA uses the same bands too
That'd be sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!
LOL
Portal 2 is highly recommended, favorite game this year... thus far
Threw his frontdoor key through the anomaly
I dunno
but then again, Skyrim is coming out...
I mean...I loved portal 1
but...I just don't want to get my hopes up again
HELLEN
I just wonder why we don't use regular radio signals, those seem to work a bit better
I'm just so sick of valve sequels sucking ass
RobotPinkie, Portal 2 is going to be better than Anything Skyrim could ever be
government allocations
false
quality
It's nothing like... completely revolutionary
mega false
ValtheJean, you are always way too hyped
and bandwidth
and bandwidth required
These idiots need armed soldiers at the portal where freaking dinosaurs can come and go at a whim
You can only be disappointed
it's just like Portal 1, essentially, but much higher budget
the higher up you go in frequency the more practical it is to run broadband wireless services
Ohai Lester
I am always way too hyped?
LESTER
LESTER IS COOLIO
So sending a video signal and a audio signal over the air doesn't use as much bandwidth as a single phone cal?
*call
Robot: that's exactly what I'm worried about
Why can't we just use both
Lester the Unlikely
Lester vs Predators
analog audio uses less bandwidth
^^
Lester wins:
an average FM broadcast station uses 150 KHz of bandwidth
Lester Pilgrim vs Predators
TV uses about 6 MHz of bandwidth
analog or digital
And wifi?
Scott Pilgrim vs Lester
WIFI uses maybe 10 or 20 MHz
Lester wins
but its done at 2.4 GHz so this is not really an issue
well, I'd say keep your expectations on the level that it's just Portal 2 with more levels
lol I mean Portal 1 with more levels
(You don't know nothing about the predators.)
but that's exactly what I don't want
that way you probably won't be disappointed
I have portal 1, and was pleased
gtg guys
if I'm going to buy P2, I want a different game
although bear in mind the band is shared
later pegacorn
bai Pegacorn
and wifi is around 50-100 mbit/s
people using WIFI are actually SECONDARY

bye pegacorn
2.4 GHz is primarily an amateur radio allocation worldwide
and a Microwave allocation XD
Say hello to the future predator
well yes it is
Bye Pegacron, Destroyer of Worlds
well it IS different, it's much more story driven, the new puzzle elements actually add something to the game
when mom microwaves popcorn my wifi gets jammed
although some consider 2.4 GHz to be high UHF still
Escape Rex!
epic music
FLY AWAY REX!!!
GOOOOO!
I'm just saying if you're worried about being disappointed, keep your expectations low :P
your oven might use 2.3 or 2.4 GHz
many do
^^

Gets in the lift.
hahaha
Dat muzak
I had an issue with Sirius satellite radio where when a microwave oven was used the signal would be jammed
this is my jam
DANCING REX
...I love that lizard
but now I miss having satellite radio
eeyup!
because Indianapolis AM and FM radio is utter crap
He's a popular character
webradio?
no data on my cellular phone
oh he stays on the show?
(why does he have a name?)
REx is pretty boos

Taking a shit on the boss.
mine is text and voice only
Oh.
Sorry Lester.
Dial-up speeds?
^^
so I have to put up with whatever crap Cumulus and Emmis feels like offering
Really bad news
that sucks
Rex takes a shit like a BAWS
those two companies own all the commercial radio stations in Indianapolis
in fact I am getting serious about running my own
(who said that was Rex's footprint?)
Like a baws
On a boss
here where I live in sweden we have MTG Group as the commercial radio monopoly

HOW THE FUCK DID IT GET IN!?!?!?!
those greedy ba*tards

They make you listen to what they want you to hear. It's not just piracy making all those small CD shops going down
lol
Come on, eat the teacher!
which is basically what ever is in the top 40 or on their "safe list"
Yeap
this is why radio is going down the toilet
*h
COME GET SOME YOU MONSTER
I'm calling it, he's Mr Hero Guy
He's the point man
not the hero
and why everyone just listens to portable media players these days
/me throws CDs at Luna
Cutter is the "hero"
Oh okay
And not only that, bands just starting get offers from big label companies mostly because they sound like another hit band
Mister on screen is the pointman/gun master
PURPLE SHIRT ON SCREEN
*Inserts his Red Hot Chili Peppers 'By The Way' CD into his mom's car's CD player

I actualy run my own low power AM and FM station right now
Creed was picked up because they sounded like Nickelback, Nickelback was picked up because they sounded like... I think it was Pearl Jam they said
Notice how the purple shirt hasn't said a peep?
but I am in the process of improving the range for both sides

That's pretty neat
now Serv-chan, on the other hand....
hard to broadcast "standard" radio from center of downtown here XD
IT KNOWS
(you ain't heard an evil laugh 'til you heard mine. Tell 'em, Dman.)
at the 4th floor of an apartment building
on FM I guess
you have to deal with lots of multipath due to reflections from buildings
CONNECTION PROBLEMCEPTION!
Around here, I'm a roller coaster nerd :P
with AM you don't have to worry about that too much
but sadly most people own AM receivers that are to be honest a piece of junk
telephone quality sound
(Dermathil redefines evil laughs)
Dermathil, Dman
Bitches please!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J1HqdQl6dw&feature=related
well
mine's broken
I have a few wideband AM receivers
and even a wideband AM stereo receiver
the AM ones sound very much like mono FM
inb4 GAH BEEEEEEES
There are very few AM stations around here
and the AM stereo receiver with my transmitter actually matches FM stereo
/me has an evil laugh on par with Doctor Evil.
But almost all of the FM slots are taken up!
Oh Dari, you and your 4 key
AM is being vacated in Europe
pretty much no AM in sweden
an example being RTE left the AM broadcast band in 2008
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZs39wggIW4
I guess it's time for some........ refreshments...
not to mention Radio Sweden shut down ALL AM operations
including shortwave and longwave
exactly
Wow
RAI still does AM though
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qTQEJjt9n0&feature=related
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "TAK IS AFTER MY ROBOT BEE!!!" - "CURSE YOU, TAK!!!!!!!!!!! CURSE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!"
That's too bad
and shortwave
radio sweden exists on internets though
does the transparency work, btw, Dman?
although part of it is digital
through DRM
dat is one freaky ass bug
that is what I heard
meh
they are continuing through the internet
kind of pointless though
kill it
I saw one like that fly inside my hamburger one day.
kill it
WITH FIRE
Anyone remember the days of Realplayer and 16kbit/s webradio?
and buffering
Hornets are the cutest creatures on earth
I threw it in the garbage bin
until they fucking bite you
AM, although not as high quality as FM, is still a pretty reliable source for information
the glass is upside down
This community is all about love and tolerance
implying the person trapped it there
Except to bees
the issue is partially receivers
You can get it a lot easier than F
like I mentioned
M
FUCK THOSE GUYS, KILL EM WITH FIAR!!!!!
another issue is sadly the growing levels of electrical interference
phff, then she's fucking stupid
Yup
because he'll come back with his hornet friends
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!
Dari, mind showing the picture of the brits in line to plunder a shop?
and come to fucking kill her
NOT THE BEES!
hey, I love bees
OH GOD IN MY EYES!
I hate hornets
a number of AM receivers actually have noise blankers
they kill beees
Cell phones, computers, electricity, etc
NOT THE BEES!!!!!
that helps with most problems
Dermathil: I haven't seen it.
and feed the bee corpses to their young
/me fires the bees in a kiln.
unfortunately its the expensive ones that do
Dman, how's it coming?
We didn't listen to much AM on my mom's Toyota Highlander
Harsh on what?
HEY I DON'T KILL BEES
trololol
BEE LOVER!
did you bring that over from the US?
interesting fact:
VOLUME HIGHER
Yup
you can't anyway
Previously, on Paradise Beach
Einstein predicted the end of society would begin with the extinction of bees
wrong band step
2003 Toyota Highlander; comes with the stock Toyota radio
Rodman - good, making pic zoom slowly :P
as I mentioned before
I AM sorta afk on it too thou
stupid kid in the room
aw...
because
you have to pay for it
I can't listen to AM here in Italy?
oh sorry robotpinkie missed ur comment
yah
megavideo pays for the copyright
oh wait
no
I'm wrong
That's why the bill in the US was trying to illegalize streaming
some vids on megavideo do get removes
nope
removed*
Oh good
They want to take websites like Megavideo down
because that tuner is designed for the US 10 KHz band step
it depends on whether or not the companies bother to send the cease and desist
yeah
yeah
I've seen a few get removed
not the 9 KHz band step used in Asia, Europe, Oceania, and Africa
someone puts them BACK pretty quickly
I'll have to listen to it in my dad's 1998 Alfa Romeo 156
But since they made the whole thing too big, it affects the whole media industry.
but they do get removed
exactly
So, they go freaking GOOGLE lawyers on their side
that one might include longwave too
That should work, then
its kind of a neat band
*got
under the right conditions you can hear all of Europe at night
Twi?
HAHA
hahaha
LOOOOOOL
It has a Pioneer faceplate but a stock Alfa radio, I believe
OF COURSE!
HAHAHAHA
Awwww yeaaaaaah!
that is so epic
M. Bison YES!
that Toyota radio can tune in a few 9 KHz step frequenceis
for example 1440
lol, if you wanted to be boring you could stream an entire video game playthrough
but on that one there might be a problem from time to time
I'll have to remember to ask dad to do that next time
like heavy rain
you might hear HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
naw, Heavy Rain is too entertaining to watch
because that transmitter is owned by RTL in Germany
That's what I usually hear
eh, the playthroughs are boring
Stream Amnesia
and they run DRM transmissions much of the time
>:[D
I can only play that game, I can't stand watching it
Amnesia?
lolol
I still haven't played amnesia
I really want to
no heavy rain
Oh, ok
this basically is the RTL Radio pop music format
Mrs. Twilight, I question your intentions.
Hmmm
@pony The pony that stars in the next clopfic dari reads live
6 The pony that stars in the next clopfic dari reads live is 8Bo12nB13on
with a DRM receiver you can hear RTL Radio on 1440 in stereo
FFFUUUU problems again with vegas pro recognising transparency D:
I remember hearing HD radio for the first time
It was pretty cool
you could play 20 questions to the challenge I gave you yesterday :P
Try redoing the process you did before?
didn't you turn it into a gif before to make it work?
DRM is about the same thing on MW/LW/SW
watch this episode
Sooooo clear xD
we have cable radio here XD
except its an open standard
Doctor Who?
yeah!
I'm just going to sleep right now
Do that!
Or...
Night everybrony
Doo eet
gnight rodman
night Rodman
You could watch Doctor Who. :P
in fact I like DRM a bit more than AM HD Radio
night Rodman
I am okay for Doctor Who
okay dari
so
I've never watched a dr who ep
you have ONE ep to prove to me its worth :P
Would I be able to adjust our car's radio to get 9 KHz?
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
show me your best one :P
and might experiment with DRM on the standard AM broadcast band
maybe
but it will be a highly technical procedure
OH YES.
I'd usually just mute it and go to work <.< >.>
where soldering experience is manditory
Could you do it?
We've watched the entire first series already
Yeah
and blink is amazing!
I might be able to do this kind of mod
Blink is a good ep
lolol show him Blink, then
usually there will be an area on the circuit board to solder in parts like diodes for example to change the receiver's localization mode
if a microcontroler is involved with tuning
We're like... one season away
Where are you? How far would you have to fly to fix our car's radio? :P
I think Blink is Series 3
I am in Indiana in the US
Ok
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF VEGAS PRO Y U NO RECOGNISE TRANSPARENCY
Hallo
blink is s03ep10 i think
myeah, I think it's the 9th episode of season 3 or something
Mmmmm..... Indiana Beach

Checking if I can raise quality yet.

: /
I'm thinking probably not.
i will not give up thou
But meh.
which is about a couple hours from Seattle
Worth a try.
in southern Lewis County
Didn't you turn off transparency and then make it transparent again, or something? I don't remember
Yea i should do that :P
You remembered the whole saying for some radio station; which one was it again?
I forget
that one was KGHO 920
out of Olympia
when they were running oldies
/me yawns
I listened to them on a daily basis
I remember it was from Olympia
Hmm
Ok.
Stream's up.
In the same way that my mom listened to 95.7 KJR FM every day
yes
Hi ctr
it's freezing for me, every couple of seconds
as I said I even remember the receiver I had at the time
yeah, it is skipping, dari.
eeyup
7Hmm...
laggy stream.
definite skips
a Sony SRF-42 AMAX certified AM stereo/FM stereo Walkman
Hi Quan
There's no skips on the preview.
great sounding tuner
well it is laggy for us.
It might be between you and us
(could it be due to the buffering of the other video? maybe try closing everything else that isn't really necessary?)
I wonder if I can get any good broadcasts fro the past...
i haves it
How do you like Android?
i don't like their new design of some reaosn
of tune in
Hmmm

have to slap him around to get his attention
12hi drf
03hi
03ripping Office right now
derp
03there's 3 discs total, but you probably don't need the second two
12okay o-o
12what's on the other 2?
03one is Office Communicator, it's like a thing where you can edit Office documents online with other people or something
03and the other is uh
03Business Contact Manager
12yeah XD
03it's a whole 5MB, don't know why it's on its own disc LOL
Je ne suis pas frenchy froggy froggy frenchy
12all i need is excel and word
03OK
03what OS are you using?
froogy diggy dig hole plot
12windows 7, 64 bit
rofl
>milk tea
03OK
Tea with milk?
12i'd like it to work with my other laptop too though, vista 32 bit
wut
03there's a 64-bit version of Office on there
03well
/me huggles Lightlugia
03the disc has both 32 and 64 bit versions
voulez vous coucher avec Twilight ce soir?
/me urks
03if you just do the autorun, it only installs 32-bit
That is pretty good french you've got there. And a French Canadian's saying that.
12i see
Oui
03if you open up the disc and use the setup inside x64, that's the 64-bit one
03up to you XD
(he means Yes)
12well
OH YESAH?
lolol I know
REALLY?
12i can install on both right?
12lol
(:3)
1264 bit for one and 32 bit for the other
I took French for 5000 years
actually just one
03yeah
03on the 32-bit, just run the setup normally
OH YEAH, WELL I TOOK LATIN FOR 3
...it was terrible
03for the 64-bit, just open the disc and manually run it
12i wonder when 128 bit comes out
I took Latin for 5.
:P
Did it for GCSE.
I took latin for 7
oh yeah well I learned English from a dictionary I found in a dumpster, beat THAT!
umad?
You did it for A level?
12*dumb thought)
12*
YEAH
06when Half Life: Episode 3 comes out
Hah, I didn't pick it for A level.
06oh wait
NOM
BY JOVE
06half life 2 obviously but the overuse pun still stands
that dude got tottally eated
that looked delicious
07o.o
lol
12lol
13!espeon
03LOL 128-bit wouldn't even make sense
03the reason they came out with 64-bit was that 32-bit had a limitation of about 3GB of RAM
0364-bit lets you go up to like 2TB or something insane I think
that wasn't very funny, Ben... not very funny at all
062tb ram oh wow
When Crysis 34 comes out
DERP
06you had to pick the number 34
HAHAHA
Because it's all insane numbers
A lot
12i heard of some 32 bit thing with time though
12where in 2032 there makes some sort of loop
12http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem
03ah yeah
03that
03That's a UNIX thing though
03I think Windows XP and newer will be fine
12XD
06Actually its more like 16 exabytes max for 64bit
12although if people are still using XP in 2038
12i'm going to be really worried
03even better Xanbreon XD
06But 256TB for AMD64
trololololo
03o.o
03what other 64-bit is there besides AMD64?
There is no fucking WAY I would go into that water
03don't say Itanium lul
06aka what we call x64 due to a 48bit virtual mem address
Back guys, and bro, can't chat now sorry (skype), also IT IS ON in silverrp
Oh God.
It's always on.
and also Robotpinkie - if I took out RD better would you upscale it again please?
06IUGHFHSBIEUF
06O.o
cuz current one is a little whitepixely on the edges : /
06Something with a 64bit virtual mem address
still, v0.2 is awesome
06saw a hitler pikachu avatar on TF2
More people about to get eated
12later
but v0.3 is needed
03OK
Nice
Myeah that's probably because of removing transparency and adding it back
Thank god you decided to show whole ep

Rainbrodash, Who is your favourite pony?
Why am I starting to think you're getting pleasure in hating whatever's being streamed by Dari nowadays? (Q_Q)
lolol
where are you RBD? if you're tired you should sleep
OHGOD.THE MUSIC!IT'S COMMING BACK!
what are you talking about?
10ValtheJean I'm in england, it's 11:18pm
Outnumbered is hillarious
I often hear you saying you don't like stuff 'round here. That's all.
10I need to stay up a -bit- longer, but I'm tired from frustration.
OHGODNO!IT'S BACK!
that's because you ignore when I say I LIKE things :P
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

Damn.
haha
Rainbrodash, Who is your favourite pony?
/me applauds Dman for making this thing with RobotPinkie. (I got it right I think?)
(eyup)
10Dman, that's a difficult quesiton
RBD's favourite pony is Dash.
10question*
:P
How much do you like colgate?
Everyone's favourite pony is Dash.
Why ask?
:P
10my favourite pony in terms of character is dash
Dari no u >_<
my favorite pony is Fluttershy
10my favourite pony in terms of potential to be awesome in character/design is Vinyl Scratch
:3
INB4 RBD hates Fluttershy
I see. but you like colgate?
dash isn't even my favorite MAIN character :P
10my favourite in terms of looks is colgate.
of background characters, Lyra is my favorite
okie doki
13In that case, I'll work extra hard to provide a healthy dose of Espeon for everyone |D
though its tied with Scratch
yesh
13Or I could just idle like I normally do, LOL
10good man Ret
you must provide FLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF :3

i'm fine with whatever, I'm going to sleep soon :P
10well i should wait until my friend gets back from work before i go to sleep
10since im at his house and everything...
hell I'm fine with seductive Twi on repeat
I'm fine with AT4W being played on this Stream.But APPARENTLY,we're too occupied with british show that i don't know!
AT4W?
Atop the 4th wall.
Actually, this show reminds me of a show I got where I live.
(a family of 5, the husband, the wife, the 16-17yo teenage, the 13-14yo and the 9-10 kid.)
*9-10yo kid.)
HAHA
tight bum?
heh
a kid who understands cartoons aren't real
CALL THE POLICE PARENTS
THIS KID ISN'T USING THE TV TO BRAINWASH HIM
CALL THE POLICE NOW!

Don't remembere.

secondary school? I'm assuming that's the british equivalent of Middle school?
Middle school? O_o
THIS IS LAME.
CULTURE SHOCK
so elementary school (usually) is grades 1-5
Middle School (usually) is grades 6-8
sometimes 9
6Anyway, TV Tropes just made me learn that the distaff counterpart of 'senator' is 'senatrix'. In some regards.
Haha
and then High School is the rest
10win
Secondary school is the equivalent of high school.
well hello sexy bitch
i mean waifu
gotcha
10silvermane mfw i thought you were talking about the little girl
We have primay school.
10i lol'd so hard
Secondary school.
College, or sixth form.
And university.
RinBarDosh, i'm not watching the show
interesting
THIS IS SO LAME
10PEGACRON U SO LAME
10GTFO
10:3
Education after secondary school is optional.
Sorry,i don't understand this humor.
According to Torchwood, she's right about pixies.
They're EVIL.
You're too young then Pegacorn.
every villain is lemons
To understand the humour of these children and the struggle of their parents.
:P
I'm not too young,i'm just not british.
Lawl.
It's nothing to do with being British.
10.. to be honest, it's hilariously british
well, anyone with a big family has gone through similar experiences
AHA!I GET IT NOW!IT'S BRILLIANT!
THIS IS BRILLIANT!
...

I'm not bothered that you don't like it. :P

Hi
Hey Barry.

How are you guys?

0pretty good
Greetings Barry, FROM THE WORLD OF TOMORROW.
0I swear, only masochists enjoy theses games
How are you Razyn?
03yay
03the THIRD CPU cooler isn't overheating
Horray 3rd party products? :P
03it's not third party
12lol
03it's made by Systemax
03who owns TigerDirect
12Systemax is pretty awesome
03I know right
I want to say alonsy. Even though I have no idea what it means, or if that is even how it is spelled.
03I now have an ULTRA case, PSU, and CPU cooler
03that's juist about everything they make LOL
03inb4 ULTRA starts making motherboards
03(ULTRA is Systemax's brand)
0my theory is that there is no beating this game
0it just ends at 29 or 30 which cannot be beaten
It's just a bluescreen of death?
0no, there's a level
0but it's literally unbeatable
0i.e physically impossible
Wow.
Looks impossible from where I am now.
i.e. a box/screen of blue death
Whoop
Just restarted the game.
XD
0O_o
0OH GOD WHY
0OH GOD
AHAHAHAHA

0I AM THE KING OF MASOCHISM
isn't masochism where you hurt yourself for pleasure?
Yes.
0eeyup
Technically

Pleasure stemming from pain inflicted upon yourself

12it's canon \
12oh

12nooo
yes, dari. Morse code.
yessss
No
I do not accept this
owning you never gets old for me :3~
And this is still the 4th level. Shows you how hard it is later on
10We'll take a vote then

I personally, do not
I
ohai Majin
..do not support this!

Good boy
;p
10Dang, I was about to write it down
(you got a google bar. use it)
xD
"- All levels with a google bar potentially require googling. So use the built in google."
just walk around the world
Handy
get a million people to write on a petition
orly
(the entire page is used, not just the images. Look everywhere)
he won't do it
10Cut it off himself, a better idea
he wouldn't be a sexpert without it
I enjoy using it too much
Yeah, the title of the page hints at that.
That too
<title>Look in the dark...</title>
LET US TALK ABOUT MASTURBATION
So basically, we know you're going to have to cheat because we made it so fucking hard, so to save you time, we put google so you don't have to change tabs to cheat?
I don't sex myself ):
/me leaves as the M word is spoken
/me sit down
do others sex you?
`-`
EdwardNewgate, no
I did
You CAN beat it without cheating.
Once or twice
Have you?
You pretty much need to be a genius and know computers really wel.
Well their custom google is SO useful.
And no.
That it doesn't even work.
(and yeah I think their google is derp)
...so most people will have to cheat
So how do I search without all the answers coming up?
might have been twice
If their google doesn't work?
Actually I think 3 times
And I'm not even sure whether that pokerstarts thing is an ad or a clue.
it is an ad
I don't even remember seeing that pokerstar stuff.

And my other question?
oh, and that thing has 140 levels
12oo
If I need to use google, how can I do it without all the answers coming up?
04LLLLLLLLL
04:3
dunno, dari. you use normal google and ignore the stuff that you know is purposefully spoilerish?
Maybe
12took me awhile to get that one drf
12ohai Chime
Hey everyone
Hey.
So how is everything?
Ok, thanks.
Dari's trying to do the notpron puzzle, the hardest on the internet.
really
only 23 people in the world beat it
I was playing Super Mario world on Gameboy -- *daffy duck jumps up* Game Boy? *is beheaded with laser* anyway, I'm stuck on World 6 Castle
and 15 million people tried it
gototheothersite.htm
What other site?
And yes, I just pulled in a scene from Looney Toons Back in Action
what's the address?
try /false/gototheothersite?
False was the previous level.
ah
then that line is related to the previous level

I went to tennis tryouts today, and I got my rhythm back

I'M SO HAPPY

12nice :3
So, I'm gonna shut up about that
how are you guys
Lies Luna
12you don't suck, I can't suck :3
/me hides
/me decides to re-read through all of Luna vs. Ponyville
LOL
not lies
/me had her wisdom teeth removed today
12so sucking is a no-no
12:3
03:(
how'd that go?
/me runs
for some its necessary
because their mouths are not big enough for their wisdom teeth to grow in or they are growing in weird
/me thinks everyone is being rude to him for ignoring him for the past three days.
LL, all of them?
at least yours weren't pulled out along with jaw surgery
I got two out.
12all 4
12tough luck drf
drf is so sad
/me hides
12NONE of them grew right o-x
bawww
12and also lol
12my unusual sensitivity struck again
"notpron" "hardest riddle" lol
12as they had to hit my gums more than the norm o-x
12a drill to the tooth
12is VERY unpleasant
12coming from the guy with 11 fillings
12XD
^
mfw i think i invented the word 'pron'
12Kosoveon has 11 fillings too?
I had my ninth one a couple ones ago
Lawl
!kosoveon
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 19 minutes and has to fly Kosoveon around until then

12;-;
12oh fun D:
12<late>
shots in the mouth aren't fun either
and the next year, that word was auto-censored

04:3
/me noms LL
/me eeps
12Kosovo
12only if you feel them
12the first few sting

Considering I saw "pron" back when I was in college, in '03
it's not painful perse
12but once your mouth is numb
(Well, actually it was usually pr0n)
just very very unpleasant
I'm pretty sure you should let Silvermane have this
12it's freaky D:
meh, i was 14 and it just didn't feel like a coincidence back then
yeah
12why did I read that as "it's not painful nurse" o-o
You know what, I believe you Silvermane.
o_o
dawwww, ilu EdwardNewgate. <3
if i was on SilverMare, i'd even so much as hug you
<333333333

probably too much pony porn
Is that what they call threesomes now?
>.>
<.<
...perhaps
(not my fault that i'm so ship-worthy)
it doesn't make sense, though. it says to contact support@dinkypage.com, which means dinkypage was suspended by themselves?
if they were shut down by their isp it'd say a different email...
Hi! :D
maybe they closed down while they deal with the email hack?
LL can only take so much soup before she pings o-o
also, scootabuse
03she said her connection is broken
make scootalove, not scootabuse
unless it's scootatoo. fuck that shit. it can go have cake
sweetiebuse > scootabuse
isn't the email hack for Mibbit and not Dinkypage?
NO WAI BRO. Sweetie Bell is my fav CMC
YOU DID IT DARI
Yeah, turns out I had the song name wrong.

Sweetie Belle also eats butterflies :P

mfw hershey bar memory stick
Why has everyone been ignoring me for the past two days?
Not sure
We haven't been?
I've been off and on
04mew
Because if it is I'm unlikely ever to get it.
I was just trying to add a dramatic effect :p
I said two days ago, and no-one responded. Same for yesterday.
huh
what's a shame
Hershey bars are usually made in Hershey, Pennsylvania
Honestly, that doesn't look like any wrapper I've ever seen
I would normally brush it off, but I've had hard days.
He went to the old school...
I thought you were just joking.
Not just a typical bad day, but hard "I want to go postal" days.
No one's been ignoring you.
What does it mean, to go postal?
oh
wait
Well, no-one been answering.
Hug bro?
Oh wait past tense used
Man I'm slow tonight
haha
He went to the old school...
It turns out I earned an extra hour of overtime.
But having 8 straight days of overtime work including weekends has pushed me very far.
I don't know how anyone normally would respond to working a lot, but many coworkers haven't responded well.
And it's not a bad job.
It's just stressful.
I just need a break here.
12lol
toonew
Hmm
It was a twix.
Oh
Or not
SQUEAK
Too new
(the name's too new)

(but it IS a twix. check the older names0

Well, I'm sorry for accusing you for ignoring me. Just thought you were when I never got a shout back from my hellos.
Ok.
Number 8.
Maybe they acknowledged you in other ways?
alright
what was answer?
I'm pretty sure I talked to you through my mic on the stream.
but either way, not everyone responds to me
Maybe.
It was raider.
Dari, we can't hear you
Old name for Twix bars apparently.
Put backwards.
Whenever I say hello, I get maybe one or two responses. Three if I'm lucky
In the URL bar.
I wasn't on stream, so if you said hi, I didn't hear it.

I already drive myself crazy enough with Past Sins
And Dresden Files.... Okay, fanfic thoughtbunny
hmm?
Dresden Files/FiM crossover
Dresden Files book 13 is out
The chapters are really long too, so it's not like you wait 3 weeks for 200 words
Devoured it the week it came out.
now for a rare relay
Seriously, Ghost Story was awesome.
I am actually transmitting PIRN in stereo on 1250 AM
oh the FIM crossover. i've read one where his apprentice fucks up a spell to the fae realm and he winds up with Bob as ponies
Anywho is getting late. Night bronies

Someone already did it, SilverMane?
some did one yes
gnight edward
it wasn't on EQD though
Cya.
Ah.

Nope.

It was... alright. Harry was slightly more 'internet' and Bob was bit more crass; but overall it was pretty in-character
dari be downloadin shit

and by internet, i mean he reacted to things like we do. what with facepalms and what not

Scary

Oh.

And I have to name it.
Gardner.

maybe?
ah

12what am i watching right now XD
12on tv

dang .-.
Lol
Gardner's ruining the third dimension, but that's only one piece of information I need something else
12lol
For username/password
um
Something to do with a .GIF?
hmmm
dragon?
I give up :P
<!--GIF me my picture back-->
12see you don't know me so well :P
what type of image are they?
<bgsound src="../stuff/mus1.mp3" loop="infinite"><!-- switch pics for parallel view -->
Are the 2 images in gifs?
I know you well enough to know you'd test me :P
so there
or if they were each named something else
12o-O
and only one of them was a gif
12heh
Ahh
12not good enough
I renamed the pic
On the site.
nice
Changed the URL
from jpg to gif
awesome
ah
the difference between the two pics
Hmm
the remote shakes
if you know me so well
that's the only thing that actually changes
yeah
what am I reading read now
everything else is perspective change
what book :P
click the remote
12twilight
nope
Nope.
Nothing.
hmmm
Password: remote?
12lol
"attention whore"
I suppose the remote
Is the attention whore?
Because it's moving around?
makes sense
Nope.
it is trying to catch your attention
what are you using for the username?
I tried both remote and gardner in either position.
Hmmm.....
are you sure gardner is one of them?
Well the source code says to name what ruins the third dimension.
Which is Gardner.
Maybe his cat's the attention whore?
At the end of the video?
true
but what's the cat's name?
and then what's the point of the gif?
Hmm
I dunno.
12played it before
12i never purified my lugia
12XD
I wonder
12wasn't that i didn't want to
is there a remote in this vid at all?
12i just couldn't figure out how
12i knew it had something to do with that machine
You seen that book in the box dari?
12umm
fill it up with normal pokemon at the highest tempo or something
?
12I finished Colosseum
there's a box to the cat's left
12and XD
12the game XD that is
it's been a while since I played it and I never tried purifying shadow lugia
with stuff written in it
12you know what i want to do one time
Too hard to see what's in it.
:P
12^
ah
god damn gardner freaks me the fuck out
12no we should all do it if we have extra pokemon games XD
you're sure there's no audio?
/me playing Metroid Prime again o.o
controller?
12instead of using one of the normal starters we pick our own starter
Eeyup
instead of remote?
12i've considered it
I'll try it.
alright
Oh.
what?
And the title of this page is stereo.
change it to remote maybe?
Dari: what about mono?
(stereo/mono)
Hmm, still nope.
The only clue we haven't used it: <bgsound src="../stuff/mus1.mp3" loop="infinite"><!-- switch pics for parallel view -->
Newest chapter of Romancing Quest is.... Interesting.
Other than stereo.
wasn't mus1 for the other thing?
Actually.
Switch pics probably is a hint for changing jpg to gif
Ohh.
The gif.
It's just the two images on the page put one after the other.
yeah
...
lol duh
XD
also
the 12 movws
moves*
yes
Oh yeah.
the number moves too
god damn gardner freaks me the fuck out
sounds interesting
hello again
hello barry
is that the same audio cue?
Eeyup
Gardner's ruining the 3rd dimension that's for sure...
So Gardner's probably the username
How are ya, Val
it's the attention whore we need to figure out
I'm good, how about you?
I'm good
remote controller? The composite word we haven't tried yet
@finemeter
6 You are 64% fine. (1475)
mfw it was just a case sensitive clue
god damn I hate case sensitive
Oh wait.
Maybe it's not Gardner ruining the third dimension?
then who is?
Just the remote?
because gardner's face is all fucked up
It's the only thing that moves.
In the picture.
like watch the vid again
his face fucking deforms
Becuase the remote moves it screws up 3d.
Hmm
That still leaves us just with remote though?
well, even if it's the remote that breaks the 3rd dimension
where do we input that info?
where do we go with that?
Yeah, and the clue is "attention whore"
It has to be the remote.
Remote?
maybe just controller?
instead of remote controller
Ahh, good point.
remote for one
controller for the other
Hmm
Nope
Maybe remote and control?
WINNING!
Number 13.
Oook.
Next page.
"no maths

Dialog pops up

There's the pictures from 10 and 13 and 4.
Hmm.

Last day of work tomorrow. No more painting job after that. Wish me luck bronies.

O.o
mfw i must read it now. also any other shipping that tries to break my current favorite's list

It's not due to "this goes against my OTP", but due to "Where the fuck did this sudden stupid shit come from?"

Oh
He said

you are way more patient than I am, Dari.
I don't normally spoil, but this deserves warning. It adds sudden Molestia.
You are also way better than I was.
Anyhow, I'll have to take my leave, 00:14 where I live. And I'd rather get some sleep than collapse in a few hours and be like 1 week in bed.

oh yeah ahhaah
we just need to keep a google docs open at all times
and add to it every time a meme is created
I saw the DCD video on youtube the other day
Ohai there
enjoyed it
howdy Rodman
IT'S NOT MY FAULT EVERYONE THINKS I'M A FUCKING JEAN
Hello Rodman
hi guys
Is it Val The Jean
Good :P
Or Valthe Jean?
.....
grrrrrrr
I'm adding you into my Durrgarr list
Dem fitting jeans!
Half pair. Jean
so
much
rage
Cut-off jeans
Low cut Vals
at times :P
Hey, so did Dman finish the video he and Pinkie were working at last night?
And acid from the eighties
Ok
bow chicka bow wow
TALLY HO!
/me is glad he can't picture dari
if it didn't physically hurt me every time you played it, I'd suggest continuing that game just to keep insulting it
also I want to see Durrgurr die :P
Remember Homer, its like I'm wearing nothing at all! Nothing at all!
Mardek RPG: Chapter 2!
I WANT TO SEE HIM DIE AGAIN
Play It!
I WANT TO SEE A SKELETON STAB HIM IN THE GIZZARD
Nothing at all. That's why.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
in the gizzard?
oh god! LOOK WHAT YOU DID DARI
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 5Kakuna.
YOU MADE BALDUR'S GATE 2 CRASH
yeah, you get that name right you whore
Rah-zin.
with its shrill Harpy's call of death :P

Ruh-zin
Raisin?
I always pronounced it raisin
stress the zin
It also tastes like raisins
/me facehoofs
like that one horse
YES.
/me wishes he could stream things to show you a PROPER rpg :P
YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES
and wb LL
How are you this glorious evening?
ValtheJean, chapter 2 and 3 are full-blown RPG-ness. ala 16-bit final fantasy, but still
you silly brits :P
I'm fine, you?
I'm still trying to figure out how to explain how to pronounce it online.
omg...if someone could shop a pony for this guys face
I would be so fucking happey
http://images.wikia.com/forgottenrealms/images/3/32/Ajantis.jpg
Excellent
yes, happey
with an e
hmm...
i see Twilight in him
he is a paladin :P
and the pants were dead
also, Baldur's Gate 1: Why the fuck do they let a level 5 wizard attack my level 1 party, starting off combat with Magic Missile, instantly dealing 3d4+3 damage to a party member?
And the sun and the birds were almost down from the top of the sky.
where exactly did this happen?
because Baldur's gate was completely open ended
Damn, you should narrate
umm, you leave the starting town, go through the woods towards the East, and it's right outside a building in the next area
it means:
you roll 3 four sided dice
add them up
then add 3
Remember kids
yeah, that's because you wandered into a higher level area
When bullets hit you, you don't die
but, it was a town
instead of listening to what gorion told you
Numbers come out and THEY KILL YOU!
and i didn't even have a map
and he just fucking attacked me because i was me
and I was like 'I'm a wizard with 4 hp, screw this shit'
I make no apologies for someone who doesn't save his game
nor listens to the plot
:p
people call jpgs j-pegs, so that's fine with me :P
Yes yes
I saw cowboys and aliens
12o.o
No crying. No. Smile.
Just a perpetual grim
*grim

Yes. It sounds like a thousand zombies burning.
Or kittens.
Yes
And no

But it was better then watching the transformers dark of the moon
we should still have a massive BMN Baldur's Gate party :P
No it wasn't
SOCK PUPPET?????
OMG

No you aren't. I can't see you, so you don't exist.

Ahh.

Silvermane could top me anytime.
Damn you mind's eye!

Only sexually though.
So you didn't want to play this earlier, why?
Becuase I didn't want my mum to see me clopping to this.

12ba,ck
DARI, DON'T SAY ANYTHING IN 5 SECONDS IF YOU AGREE CARAMEL PONY IS BEST PONY
04wb
12Thanks
12too much effort to type in names these days D
oh good
so we're agreed
good night :P
04Honestly, I find using Tab annoying
04It's easier to type names
12Hi Bree :3
12tab can sometimes create great humor though
04DARNIT THIS TEA NEEDS MOAR SUGAR
Rainbow Dash is best pony and Cara-Mac is canon.
12XD
12lol
lol.
12no go own someone else like Drake D:
04XD
lol, you know what I realized?
02Nnng
02I dunno whether to upload this picture to dA or not
04Heya Shiny
03nobody should ever upload anything to dA
02Hey Lyon
12drf i agree with you that da is a bit nuts at times but why boycott them drf?
02Well, I do, so...hi, my name's Nobody.
04XD
/me pets Shiny
/me sprawls out under Lyon
Well, for one thing I'm all alone.
02Hmm hmm hmm
Nope
ohai
anyway
there are no mibbitfoals left.
02Manly's on :D
04Hey Shiny
Huh, you're right.
02Was ;v;
02Yeah?
04May I ask why Manly deleted his profile on TST?
02He said all the friends he talks to are on the other sites he goes to. So no point in having TST anymore.
04Fair enough
03XD
12what else do you boycott?
04dA has some weird people on it, I agree.
04But still
04That's a bit...extreme
04...
04On second thought
/me shot
03because dA never even works
03Look at real artists like Articuno, they have their own galleries
03hosted professionaly
03:P
12arti also has a DA as well though
03I know
03for the n00bs who can't find her site
eww da
04dA is more for non-professionals who just like to show off *coughmecough*
03^
04But eh.
04What are you gonna do about it? It's frackin' huge.
04As another question: Do solo writers usually have their own sites as well?
03nothing, I just stopped using it
02Rip on everyone who uses it lol
02Of course Lyon :P
03depends on the person Drake
04Ok cool
04And what do you mean drf?
03depends on how technically knowledgable they are
03some random n00b who writes fanfiction isn't going to know how to make a site
;.;p
03but someone who does know how to probably will if they want enough people to read it
03it's like comic series
03the few I do follow
03like Xkcd
03they all have their own sites, not dA :P
04Hmm
03yeah, dA is basically just for people to show off
03and I prefer to ;show off by having my own site so
/me hides
04Well, I'm interested in web design (not that I'm exceedingly good at it lol) and I was thinking that if I ever get a story started I might make a website or something for the story as practice in web design
04XD
04'Course, I'd have to practice HTML and stuff first
04All I know is the basics
02All that shizz
12hmm
03see
03I don't even know HTML
03I just use FrontPage
03which is like DreamWeaver but not Adobe XD
04FrontPage?
04Oh
03Microsoft's version of Dreamweaver
04We used Dreamweaver
03the new name is Expression Werb
03*Web
03but eh
04Which I still have on my laptop
03well basically you use it like Word
03you can just do it graphically
04I (sorta) made a website but it's crap
03and it does the coding for you
04Oh cool
03hey my website is crap too
03I mainly just serve files on it :P
04But still, I think you ought to know a bit of coding
04XD
03well I';m lazy
03so yeah
I hear movement
04XD
You hear nothing.
Except the grue.
04FrontPage...Do you have to pay for it?
I think he just rolled over.

04I'd almost finished the summary for DoI (which is now 15000 words btw), before realising the final confrontaion made no sense and had to go back and add a completely new side-plot

06YAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWNNNNNNN
04I think I may beat Defeat XD
06mornin all
Have fun, Drake :p
But seriously, anything close to Defeat's length is going to suck
nothing should ever be Defeat's length
and Defeat sucks anyway
04This isn't a chapter, it's just a summary so I think it'll be fine
Still, Drake
You don't need to go into THAT much depth
04WELL I DID

I'd debate that
No Drake

florida. i never was a good speller. XD
04o-o
honestly call it a crutch but iblame the add i had when i was in 2nd grade couldnt sit still to learn
03the correct answer is USA
03Florida is not a country :P
06i know what he means, that is enough for me :P
drf no 1 asked for a politically correct answer.
/me lols at auto script
03^
03my mIRC doesn't even have the slapping with a large trout crap
03since it's a custom scriptset so I can do the WBs
im on swiftkit
03you're also a n00b
03so yeah.
and your a dick head
03that wasn't necessary.
04wow
04I'm surprised he didn't get kicked
neither is degradeing others by calling them noob
03it's not degrading if it's the truth
04Insane_Lugia, if you swear at others your argument basically becomes invalid
wel when drf starts it how do you expect someone to react?
04/fact of life
03^
03Insane_Lugia, just ignore it
03that being said
03I'm going to bed.
02[The current time where I live is 0305:13:1502 on 03Wednesday, 08/17/201102. I am in 03Eastern Standard Time02, also known as 03GMT -5 Hours02.]
03yeah.
04And no, I'm not taking sides
then show little more respect for your pears
06gnite drf
.
03I respect pears, they're tasty fruit
/me runs
04Hey look
04NS is here
/me leaves
not respecting me by calling me noob
04Let's wait for some 'wat' comment
u going to give <censored> u guna get <censored> just how it goes. im being provoked by being degraded.
o/` Another one bites the dust, oh - another one bites the dust! o/`
Insane_Lugia, there's no nee-
06xDDDDDDDD
04XD
I love my scripts
04Minnet, awesome
Excuse me?
04That was just awesome
Minnet is a bot lol
04oh
Insane_Lugia
04Could've told me earlier damnit
That was unnecessary
hmm?
drf only corrected what you said
He didn't attack you
04Also swearing = Big no in this community. At least, insulting swearing
sorry, so is standing by and watch him degrade others. ive seen enough.
Insane_Lugia, he doesn't degrade others
Ever heard of "joking"?
theres other ways to joke with out putting others down for swotwear they use et
etc
and from what ive been told im not first to complaina bout him
03wow, someone's new here and already my haters are trying to convince new members to hate me?
03I'm impressed, actually.
04drf is a fact of life
Insane_Lugia, there is a different between being influenced by others and making your own decisions
I suggest you do the latter
03^
i dont hate you love you as a friend as i do everyone else <3
03that sentence made no sense
04There's really nothing you can- what
03and yes I know I said I was going to bed
03I'm just watching how this unfolds as it's quite funny XD
Even if you think drf was wrong and what he said was silly or degrading, you don't attack him back, Insane_Lugia
06Sounds somewhat like me. I like everyone until they've made themselves deserve otherwise :P
03and people who hate me over one comment, I mean LOL WUT
04Insane_Lugia, you've just made yourself look bad by attacking him. The end.
03plus I was being literal, Insane_Lugia is a newbie to the chat, hence n00b
03:P
dont matter, fact is ive only been around for few weeks if that. hes been around longer there for naturally people has his side. just how it works.
06and lets just say drf and his jokes are and have always been somewhat controversial, best thing to do is just assume everything negative he says is not serious
/me goes and gets dinner now
noob != newbie
06and Nah, n00bs implies someone who
04wat
anyway
03no?
03Half this channel doesn't like me LOL
06refuses to learn
04what
04WHAT
06and what
04I do NOT have his side.
And Insane_Lugia, don't assume things
/me goes to get changed in the meantime
/me afks now
please forgive me im little more blunt and dont give 2 craps bout anythign at 5am =\
You're actually pretty wrong :p
And lol, that's not an excuse
03well it might imply that
03but eyah
03*yeah
03it's technically just a shortened version of the word newbie, etc
03anyway LOL
i know it snot but its fact. impulse behaveour has ruened a lot of friendships of mine =\
Alright, seeya
06that actually annoys me as much as people using the word "scrub" without knowing what it actually means xD
06and okay, cya
Then correct that behaviour, Insane_Lugia
And Xeli, reminds me of when I started using watersports
cya later sorry for bein an ass just irritated atm
06what
06that word is
lol and also stop swearing
06forever ruined for me
06permanently
06so WHY

06hey that's discrimination against donkeys
Whether it's a habit or not, you can not do it :p
think ima head out before i get my self into deaper crap
haha Xeli
I swear all the time
way more than you do
And yet I don't do it here

well hey

instead of censoring
04Is it weird for an epilogue to be two chapters long?
06a little
Yes

06mmhmm, iTunes can be stupid with movies and such, but the right free app does wonders
06also, iTunes HATES Windows 7 x64
02fufufufufufu?
02because I'm using that
02and I was about to install itunes
02lol
/me yawns
/me enjoys making all the main characters family, whether by blood or law.
orly Drake
I'd love it
if the Hensh turned out to be Lyon's father
04This guy was acting as a surrogate father for one of the main characters, and in the epilogue he actually adopts him
04LOL
and Seran was Lyon's sister
04That would kill the pairing
And Rex, Leonard etc. were their cousins
04Which I don't want.
and Kommander Kulesz could be their uncle
04Ok, you can't make EVERYONE one big happy family.
actually no
04That kills the idea
Kommander Kulesz is their father
the Hensh is their godfather
04"Seran, I am your father!"
04"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
Darth Vader style.

/me Nicks Nick
Minnet: be extra floofy
/me is extra floofy
/me is kidnapped "Help Nick thief!"
You just got Nicked!
Noob. :(
nou
/me escapes
Too Nicky >:
Pfft.
dun call me Nicky
You're the one that wanted to be friends.
WE could be friends forever.
Living in harmony
Singing and dancing.
Harmony and dancing ain't my thing.
We could sit in my room and smoke weed, then.
This bed has had a long life.
So many stories to be told
You could be in one of them
Not into weed either.
We could drink wine, and listen to classical music.
Eww, wine...
Wine's quite nice, if you've got the expensive shit.
It's pretty much rotten juice.
):
WE COULD WATCH KAWAII DESU ANIME AND LISTEN TO JPOP WHILE EATING POCKY.
and no, I didn't call you Nicky
that would be...urgh
/me shudders
Or, we could watch hentai.
The benefits of being my friend is that I'm versatile. like a bendy straw.
I've got a ton of hentai.
Figures.
Yaaaawwn
I mean....back
Currently playing games on my PSP. So fucking bored.

Hi Pinkie
'sup Barry

What
(I say beech, cuz my family, none of whom speak english, were going 'TO TE BEECH' all day with a funny accent)
ah lol
and if you cut yourself, you might need to get it steeched
Games about games are the best games
12using that logic
12yugioh is an awesome series
i mean
lol
revised: games about video games are the best games
12once again
12yugioh is considered an awesome series
12XD
12their games
i thought the same until my yugioh tradign card deck got stolen
12are based on video games because they have holograms in the series
So how are ya robotpinkie?
How you doin valthejean?
Cleaned up the vector a bit, Dman, converted to transparent GIF too.
12i still have my yugioh deck
12it's in my safe XD
Cool, ya didn't have to, so thanks ^_^
I'm not too bad myself
I also discovered it should be 3000 x something, not 4000, just ta let you know. this works best i thought
Well, I got Fluttershy and Applejack, so that's awesome :P How u, Dman?
I leave for college next tuesday, which means this friday is my last work day :D
that was years ago though
that's good to hear, valthejean!
/me is a happy pony
back when it was considered "hot" here in sweden
12some of the yugioh games are interesting
plus (ironically) being at college means I'll actually have time to do pony related things
12like the spinoffs
It IS 3000 x something, though?
12pokemon is such a better card game though
I requested 4000 x something last time:P silly me
or do you mean 3000 in height?
So who made that RD vector with the zoom in and the sexyness and things?
3000 across :)
Ziltoid - i cut it out (easy part) and robotpinkie kindly make it hi res ^_^
lol I did the vector :P
Dman did the sexy
OH and
Rodman found the actual pic
Cool
have you seen the vid? :D

I challange do make a fluttershy one
you*
Me? Yeah, the first version you uploaded
...if robotpinkie is available, challenge accepted.
just maybe not Tnoight, but latest tomorrow night
I'd love to do a Fluttershy one :D
:D
hmmmmm
i will do one tonite or tomoro, i guess
Hi LL
12oy vey >.<
12hai
we'll see, not sure how late I'll be up
how does charm do damage?
I was actually doing a colgate one myself, using her face ontopof vectors, for rainbrodash, but maybe i'll do Flutter next :3
still need a background isolated?
(I only did this one as a joke aniways)
robotpinkie - for fluttershy?
I can make isolated background fine
or Dash
(look at vid - no RD in background, i took her out and filled it in :D)
Oh okay, cool
/me lurkes
backgrounds i can do, i just fail at vectors : /
12Insane_Lugia_is_on_Runescape
Nice :D
HOLY CRAP IT DID SOMETHING
12you are just that bad looking
enough bashing each other
/me hides
It's mostly just cleaning up all the artifacts that takes a lot of time
12 Hello, ehhhhhhhh and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
artifacts? (*knows nothing on images :/*)
after that I can autotrace and correct whatever's wrong
well in video and image compression you get weird blocks, can't autotrace without smoothing it all out into even colors
yea those weird blocks
I've been wondering why : -/ translates to eyerolling...
i wish I knew
lol I have no idea either
huh, weird. I swear the pic I uploaded is 3000 across
do you mean you need it in 4000 across?
Ok, so
oh you're right
last image WAS 3000 caross
then that's all fine : D
lol okay
(also can't believe you're making a better vector, thank youuuuu~~ <3)
want the transparent GIF version?
I have the one you gave earlier
unless this is a new one?
lol it's not THAT much improved, I just missed some spots
oh no, I haven't uploaded new one
Eh, i can try it out and make another vid if u want :3
It's up to you, if you're happy with what we have, then I'm happy :P
I really would like to make it on par with twi vid, and that one has no whilte pixel things
Then i would be able to happily upload to youtube =]
not really OCD, but i like to do things perfectly
Well, hopefully making it GIF helps, that way no white pixels on the sides
okie doki
/me awakens
/me delurks
hang on, might take a bit to upload
02omfg Obsi talked :O
/me gasps
...oh want me to do vid now? okie
as I said thou g2g shower soon
12oh dear
The only thing that would be more shocking in TSTland?
oh you can do it whenever you like, but I might aswell upload it now
If Arti turned out to be a male and Xai turned out to be female

Hi GGgala
@pony GGgala
hey Barry

@pony Gggala's sidekick

well, it's half awesome.

ohai Dermathil
how was STALKER?
ohai Dermathil
STALKER was nice.
I'm still in the first half of the game though.
inwaylatebutohwell howdy Dermathil
ohai Val
ever played STALKER, Val?
very briefly, yes
did you like it?
6Hey..Sry but I can't stay.. >.<
eh....not really
it probably didn't help that my friend was talking it up like crazy
:(
he always complained my games weren't realistic enough
12what the heck are you playing
and when I finally asked him for an example of a realistic game, he gave me Stalker
Was it the visuals (textures, models, lighting, etc) that you didn't like?
You may not want to see him... mzybe... if you have the guts...
Really?
*maybe
12o.o
it was mostly the frustration with the combat system
Do you wish to see him...
I'm playing Stunt Biker
(Stalker's REALLY realistic. Gunfights are very fluids when you get the hang of it0
the fact that I could sneak/shoot better than my character was frustrating
eh, I disagree on the realism
it's a game like anything else
This is all I have... may he frolic in paradise, and puppy heaven... :'(
Val, the accuracy of your guns was probably due to the fact that the guns themselves were horribly shitty.
6What? o.o
F*CK... I miss him sooo much...
/me playing Beyond Good and Evil (the demo, anyway)
yes, he used that same excuse too
12i was t alking to Espeon XD
He's gone c7...
The guns in the beginning of the game are very inaccurate due to being, well, entry-level guns
6Who? What happened?
Gone...
of which I replied that I've fired FAR shittier weapons in real life
with much higher accuracy
pup-pup, bo, our bulldog...
6DD:
:'(
6I'm really sorry..
Not sure I'd say it's realistic just because it has crap guns...
I can tell you something. I originally didn't like the game either.
6Sry,gtg >.<
:(
I hated the graphics and the accuracy too.
the graphics don't bother me
dem russian games
graphics are just fluff to me, they're nice when they're good, but they can't ruin a game for me
But I was recommended to download I think it was STALKER: Complete 2009. Graphics get a HUUUUUUUUUGE graphical upgrade
And I began liking the game more in general.
Name changes for some of the guns so they are named after their real-life counterparts, and tons of stuff.
It is also easier to see your enemies with that.
meh
1/3 of every stalker player downloaded it
if a game is only good if you download a mod, that speaks very poorly for the game
@pony Barry's drinking buddy
6 Barry's drinking buddy is 12Soar1in'
12she even has a ROLLING ATTACK o-o;
mods should compliment an already good game, not make it
Val, that's because the game was released in 2006.
And it really didn't age well.
at least I got a pony who's old enough to drink
/me still hasnt gotten past Fire Temple on OoT >>;
7Val when are you getting left4? :)
/me hasn't played OoT in a while :p
12Heart health system
I play plenty of old games without mod upgrades
12a camera
Left for question mark?
Sathi: Whenever it goes on sale :P
12wtf am I playing o-o
The story for STALKER is incredibly good btw.
12a spin attack
/me dnhbafniewcskmxoew
I've heard as much
12I'm playing the 360 version of LoZ
LOL
never heard of that game. I've heard of Left 4 Dead, but not Left 4 Question Mark
if I get a L4D game, should I get the first or the second?
o.O
but the gameplay bothers me so much I just have no interest continuing it
second I would say
considering it has everything from the first
7second
I'd suggest playing a little longer. You should get the hang of the fighting pretty quickly.
12she even has a 4-letter name o-x
and Im playing the Wii version of Halo
@pony Princess Peach's alias
6 Princess Peach's alias is 7Mr Br15eezy
12ew
12wat is?
it's magic
but why force myself to play a game I hate?
I made that mistake with FF13
and I've only regretted it
12lol
I can understand for FF13.
Might get that soon, then
But what I say is that I find STALKER far superior to Fallout 3 and New Vegas, for example.
well, I've never been a fan of Fallout
also
(can you shoot the lights out in Fallout?)
anyone heard of "nanashi no game"
that game is being fantranslated right now
(also, the underground complexes/dungeons are insanely well designed.)
So therefore Splinter Cell on the PS2 is superior to Fallout 3! :P
lol
Let's try one more
@pony Princess Zelda's Alias
6 Princess Zelda's Alias is 8Apple Bl4oom
Mmmmm Gran Turismo
lol I like Fallout 3. I mean it has some serious flaws, but I like having a massive open world
ahhh just played Baldur's Gate 2 again last night...hardcore nostalgia right there
Imma racing game kind of person
Afternoon.
8Hey Cross
>yfw I played Baldur's Gate for the first time in 5 years two days ago
12aaaand demo done
i gave up on the series after the fourth game tough
orly?
Hello.
actual Baldur's Gate or shitty ps2 Baldur's Gate?
Hello.
Can do.
polyphony can't keep deadlines
Yup, gonna make may through that and the expansion, then it's BG2 and its expansion
btw sprinkles, heres the cupcakes pic: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/collab/src/130115591169.jpg
dunno if you have the others
lol nowai, PC game Baldur's Gate
good :P
what class you playing?
12oh nooooo...
Paladin
GT5 is pretty good
lol, nowai! I'm playing a Pally for like, the first time this run through
I never do normally, but eh
But yeah, that should've come out 2 years ago instead of last November
haha
..eww..
Lulz
6So you haven't attended any Brony Movie Nights, correct?
I had to force myself to not pick a mage or thief
...yeah
The eyeball makes that picture. :P
I've never played through an infinity engine game with a paladin before :P
No
nothing makes that picture
oh
what about Duke Nukem Forever
it is bad and the artist should feel bad
you should download that BG1 mod that lets you pick BG2 classes and such
oh god that game
that one has been vaporware for well over a decade
because you'll want to be one of the specialized paladins
I didn't know there was such a thing
I just find it funny.
/me sighs
yeah
12brb x.x
and it only JUST NOW was released
can't remember the name
kk
/me is twisted. :P
but the difference is
the ending to DNF is crap
but it basically makes importing BG1 characters into BG2 SO much easier
lol I dunno, I'm gonna start from scratch after Tales of the Sword Coast
ah
while the ending to GT5 has lots of car porn
well then in that case forget it :P
like once I hit BG2, I'm gonna make a new character
(if you get that)
not me
...unless I rly like the Paladin, but I doubt it :P
even though I am working on car stereos
yeah...paladin's in BG1 were kind of sucky
Uh, incorrect. I've been to three, last my count. I watched one of them in a while ago, and I've visited the two of them of late, though I must admit my experience with them is far less than I would like. the
You guys with your r-pegs.
:P
plus you could recruit Ajantis
Ohai dari
and he was fucking ballin
I have one out of a 1959 Chevy on the work bench now
ohai dari
Hey.
oh look! it's that whore dari!
Dari robotpinkie made a better RD
Hello, again Dari
oh yeah, cross is a writer, so he might do some textwalls
lol I missed a bit, Dman
just a heads up
/me 6nostalgically noms Nick.
Yay.
:P
I thought he hadn't been to... oh whatever.
dari, ever played Stalker?
Mind getting a new one? virtually identical, just fixed some white pixels
is it me, or does there seem to be an unusual amount of mods online right now?
I have just about found the problem too
...
wait..
IT'S A TRAP
hes been to a few, but he doesnt talk much during them
6Hey, Silver!
/me hides
the classic case of dried out and bad electrolytic capacitors
OHSHI-
He's been to 3...?
Hmm.
How are you today :)
You missed a bit? robotpinkie?
It's an intervention
Sure man doo eet
6Why were you late to the two?
( :O ) >mfw http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112364-Notch-Challenges-Bethesda-to-Lawsuit-Deathmatch
hah
also robotpinkie - found a way to make any pic work with vegas pro
8>of late
its heavy too all steel construction
I hope they accept
No I haven't Dermathil.
so it's literally GET, stickinvegaspro, RENDER =]
that whole lawsuit thing is so stupid
8aka recently :D
6>inability to read
Sprinkles. Fail. :P
8lolololo
LAWSUIT DEATHMATCH!
6Nevermind that then.
8anyway, back to the interview
ValtheJean: I know. But that specific lawsuit is pretty much like free popcorn entertainment.
that 52 year old tank would survive without a problem
pretty much
...I was distracted by german chocolate.
...from Germany.
Dman http://i.imgur.com/sapsa.gif
They want to settle the lawsuit over a game of Quake 3 Deathmatch.
it's just so stupid that it even exists
6What is your availability for moderating?
go tell that to the Bethesda lawyers.
Almost identical, just... shouldn't have any white lines at the edges at all
ty robotpinkie
i'm going to dinner now, but will do eet =] when i get back from idnner
Alright, later Dman
hey staying on pc
just can't do anything
other than chat :D
Bethesda will never go for it, but it would be awesome.
nice
My availability is quite flexible. I'm self-employed and live by myself, so I can set my own hours without any problems. I'd say my availability is whenever you need me for; I can just move my schedule around to accomodate.
also, that last question was straight off the application :/
fuck you emoticon
: /
lol oh okay
=]
and I'd love to see that deathmatch
6Do you have any experience moderating?
6Busy-ish. *late*
Team Mojang are pretty hardcore
I totally care.
yeah, I hope that deathmatch if it goes down gets livestreamed or filmed by MLG
that'd be awesome.
Would Bethesda be allowed to pull in ringers from id or just the Elder Scrolls team?
dunno
I got no idea.
And I thought Bethesda was pretty cool, well Mojang is awesome.
he wasn't very clear on the challenge
well, it's a little redundant to ask questions that we already have answered on the application, dont you think?
I'd think they'd be allowed to take ringers from ID
DERMATHIL! BRO!
I think it was basically just a way of saying "look, this whole thing is stupid, can we just have fun and get on with it?"
Valthejean, that's exactly what it is.
Regrettably, no, I can not claim any experience in moderating, though I do feel up to the task. But to answer your question, no, I do not.
/me brohoofs Dman.
/me brohoofs Dermathil
6What talents do you bring to the table?
Based on what was said, I would think they could pull guys in from id, on the other hand, the id guys have no real stake in this matter so obviously it should be the Elder Scrolls team that has to defend their own honour. :p
bah damn you chrome update... can someone link the interview channel?
Just a little. I'm just c/p'ing... I've had no sleep so I'm not horribly attentive to WHAT I'm c/p'ing...
#bronystateinterviews
I'd still like to see one :P
yeah, that'd probably what the ID team would tell em.
8in other words, what can you do that would set you apart from other applicants
8?
thank you
yeah, same.
Myeah
good thing that slash is there
Lawl
i would hate for you to be CP-ing XD
Oh man, it's really too bad it probably won't happen.
INB4 wall of text response
Lawyers don't allow that kind of shenanigans :P
like i said, he tends to text wall sometimes XD
12yays
12it connected
12lol
12irony oxo
Well, I suppose if we're talking personally, I can say that I can remain level headed and objective in the face of stress, spamming, trolls, and what have you. I work well in teams, and I do my best to communicate in a respectful but firm manner. To be blunt, I believe I have what to takes to effectively and professionally handle situations as they arise.
I love browsing the DMC forums on Gamespot
Hi, Sathi
it's hillarious to read people flame about a game that doesn't even exist
Do you need anything specific?

Hello again

All of you.

Applejack!
NOPE

Well, let's see. The BMN is already on EqD and Ponychan, and those are the two biggest sites the community has, so I'm not sure there's much more you can do in the realm of advertising. Also,
WHO'S A GOOPY GOOBER YEAH!
plz stream hot hot RD clopvids for us
/me is a silly pony
Also, hey Polarfire. <3
ohai everyone
Dari
Oh, IM a goofy goober YEA
YOU'RE A goofy goober YEA
10ohai Polarfire >:3
WERE ALL GOOFY GOOBERS YEA
ohai Polarfire
you streamed yourself sleeping.
hello polarfire
goofy goofy goober goober YEAAAAA
oh
polarfire is my witness here
last night dari admitted to the awesomeness of Caramel :P
"I'm a goofy goober! ROCK! You're a goofy goober! ROCK! We're all goofy goobers! ROCK! Goofy goofy goofy goofy goober! ROCK! "
No I didn't?
haha
"Put your toys away" Well then I got to say when you tell me not to play I say NO WAY! No no no no way! "I'm a kid" you say. When you say I'm a kid I say "Say it again." And then I say Thanks! THANKS! Thank you very much.
(have to post legendary song)
I like caramels, they're delicious
well it goes 2 ways.
I'd like to think you have a good set-up, the only thing I can really see as needing change is having back-ups to the planned streamers and checking for technical hiccups before screening, but that's more of a background thing, and something I'm sure you're already well aware of.
So if you thinking that you'd like to be like me Go ahead and try. The kid inside will seeeeeeeeeet youuuuuuuuuuuu freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
good points he mentioned there
When did I admit Caramel was awesome?
10anybody here a fan of competitive Starcraft 2?
robotpinkie - dinner eaten. Let's do this
just before I went to sleep
Yay, let me know how the pic works, Dman
will do
in about 10 seconds :P
RBD: I love SC and SC2, but I stopped paying attention to the competitive ring after 2 came out
I imagine viewership will grow exponentially at the return of Season 2, so that too, may solve itself on its own. Thus, no, I believe the current set-up and projected path is more than sufficient.
Pfft, I don't remember this.
RainBroDash - PLLAAAAAAYGUUUUUU
I look at some sc2 matches sometimes

you are a mmmmmbetch who went to the beeeech who likes mmmbananas?
I saw that BMN was looking for help in moderating on the latest EqD announcement, and figured that I had the time, the passion, and the committment to help something I enjoyed, so I offered my services. If I can be of help, then I will gladly do so. I would like to see this community strengthened and protected, so I thought I should do my part.
Is that right?
I uh i didn't s-say anything a-about b-bananas
.
you are a mmmmbetch that likes bananas?
i wasnt scrolled all the way down so i didnt see that a question was asked
I-i'm not a b-bitch
I-i don't m-mind bananas
So you are a beetch who didn't say he likes bananas?
oh please no
I i um i don't mind b-bananas, i mean

Hello everyone

Hi Polarfire
Pretty good
Excellent
Dman: oh hey, does that mean there were two versions before that?
ohai Barry

Nothing quite like waking up at 2:30

Feels good/bad man
Heya silly dragon

GGgala_ yea
Fo realz? I hoped you stayed up to 6 am or something
Was v1 uploaded, even?

then eat all of that and sing until you can't anymore, you'll feel the need to sleep again
But I don't want to sleep
Yes you do
When you upload to Youtube, I think you should name it something similar to the Twi one :P
NOT right now, but later
You willllll
yea, but will post here first
^_^
/me rawrs
If you're asking if I understand how to use it, then yes. If you're asking if I know all the commands and how to use the technical side, then no, that is something I would have to be taught.

That image?
It doesn't have anything?
lolol

I don't think I'll ever recover now
It doesn't have gore, R34.
Shock.
She was always the best pony
Anything.
yeah that image isn't bad imho, aside from the topic
It's Cupcakes, it's a warning.
NOPE
best pony is fluttershy
YUP
It's a reference to Cupcakes? So what. If you get the reference you either read it of your own accord
Mane 6 is best pony...
Well, Cupcakes is something we should try to avoid having the chat spammed with, but this isn't graphic, only suggestive, so I believe this merits only a verbal warning.
or just know about Cucpakes
Hence warning.

Sweetie Belle is nice :(

Hmm. We definitely want to stay away from posting anything R34-ish in nature, but again, this is more suggestive than anything. Perhaps as an example, this would recieve a kick to let others know this is unacceptable.

A bit longer than it was to get there, huh?
Nice, Dman, doesn't look like there are any white edge pixels now
because like, he'd be a complete dick to all the ladies

he would only drink wine
It's supposed to be Sweetie Belle.
and be all "Sorry bout that babe, lemme buy you a drink"
ah
and then we'd hit it off
And it's a verbal warning, I'd think.

RainBroDash's drinking buddy is his keyboard.
12hai Danny
I'd say that no action be taken here. While the previous picture implied something more, and as such could inspire others to take it further, this seems fairly mundane, about as neutral as any shipping image really. No action taken.
10LOL dashite
Never let them near the kitchen
10i hate you
He will drink me under the tabl
Your keyboard hates you more. :p
awww poor rainbro

Wish I could've been there
Hey guys, would you believe that someone made a fanfiction crossing Doctor Who with Harry Potter?
i have a little too much favouritism over fluttershy, considering i say errypony best pony, cuz i have fluttershy toi :3
nice gif dermathil
hehehe
Barry - whut
you can cross cr who with anything
srsly whut
@Barry of course. Harry Potter fans are fucking crazy
dr who*
Harry Potter is basically the REASON shipping is still popular
god damn Harry Potter...
sheeppeeng
wait really?
lol
...oh yeah, sorry about the confusion |D
OFC I'D MISS IT.
EVERYONE, ABANDON SHIP!
you haven't seen shipping until you've seen harry potter shipping
i wasn't even into shipping much, even thou a lot of my friends were, till FiM
I read a harry potter shipping fic once
03thanks
The log's in his application thread, Peanut.
Wellfuck.jpg
how does that work thou?
that shit will ruin your fucking brain
it was Hogwarts x giant ocyupus
Avatar shipping.
/late
I know. I'm looking at the interview now.
Basically, they take the main plot of Harry Potter, have The Doctor defeat Voldemort, with said Doctor taking Harry to his home planet, where, at the age of 8, the time lords make him one of them
erryone in HP has a canon ship or dies or canon stays single, so how u ship HP?
Octopus*
12np
Barry lol
12wait who are you thanking drf
Dman, you don't want to know
03you
just whut that fanfic
03XD
12anth causing you confusion
12or me
12XD
ValtheJean 0_0
03you for chaning the topic
03*changing
12ok
12[13:45:01] <Anth-Umbreon> ...oh yeah, sorry about the confusion |D
12had to make sure :P
Dman, canon? Who needs canon? HarryxDraco is my OTP.
Harry Pothead fans can take even the SLIGHTEST of phrases and make the biggest fucking contradictions ever
Dashite no u
03XD
:p
What about us HP fans who don't ship?
It also has Dumbles bashing
or write fics
Yea
Dman: >implying canon ships get in the way of shipping
I would say nothing:
ajksfhkjsdh
agh XD
True dat, GGgala_, True dat
also, there ere YEARSbefore the last book came
I would only link (if I had it) the picture of Pinkie saying "Give her time"
*there were years
02back
Also. Spoiler: Snape kills Dumbledore
of course cannon ships would get in the way. have you seen those things?
so is HP fanbase worse than us? omg
oh no, they even disregard canon ships
Hey GGgala_ I read cupcakes today
I'd say he did pretty well and would make a good mod.
they're a case of fandumb
Dman: people were insanely delusional that Harry/Hermione would become canon, even after five books. o_0
wb
Dman: orly?
But I also have bias towards him because he's one of my big friends on the site.
oh dear, gggala_
and Ya rly
what did you think dman?
Like hipster
^^
how was it
I have 2 things to say about it:
1) Huh, so that's how far it was taken. I see i see.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeyup
Plus HarryXLuna is my otp
and 2?
Hmm... where's Yusuke?
Wb Ray
I think Cupcakes was more Gore than actual Horror
2) This wasn't THAT bad, and pinkie made it funny. I thought it would be pinkamena, but a) pinkie made it funny, and b) couldhave been SO MUCH WORSE, even after reading alt endings. I mean, she has womanly parts, and theres a billion ways to torture before killing.
i dont think his interview is for another 45 minutes or so, is it
?
also, brb
>2:30
12wb
Cupcakes was overhyped to me basically
oh
Yeah
02Thx
I had the same reaction to it
Dman is 3:30
Dman Have you read Sweet Apple Massacre?
was thinking of Dman
all i could think about was womanly parts and so much potential missed torture
edwardnewgate no
a lot of those people who complain about cupcakes are just drama queens
lolol
Yea barry
It's possible that Yusuke just doesn't know about bronystate.co.cc and gave up since dinkypage is down.
Oh, It's imho worse than cupcakes
Cupcakes just... isn't very good.
I mean, 'I got my 'I' on you!'
Dman: yeah people make a bigger deal out of it than it warrants. I think at one point #BronyState mods said 'no more talking about cupcakes' even
I just won't read it because of the severe lack of grammar
I literally laughed aloud, almost dropped my DS in the sand
It doesn't ruin anything for me, I just think it's really badly written.
Cupcakes has brilliant puns, don't be knocking them.
Yea GGgala_ i got told that too
well then, we've done a great job about following that rule
Dari - i'm saying it was brilliant!
It's not badly written if you read the updated version.
which is horse apples
Dari - ionly read updated one
13Never read it.
where is that?
13:P
Have any of you read Sweet Apple Massacre?
it's not that bad
no
ohai flutterpeanut
Eh, guess I should read the updated version
13I don't read any fanfics haha.
no edwardnewgate, link phaps?
13Hello Val.
Well, I only read Cupcakes.
/me brohoofs peanut
Because it was hyped up so much.
ohai Flutterpeanut
same
If you want it, I can find it again. It's pretty bad
I don't regret it, it was funny.
/me 13brohoofs ValtheJean
eyup
I am proud to say I have not and will NEVER read any fanfics
edwardnewgate - if it's bad, then eh
13Eeeyup.
hmmm
Not even Fallout: Equestria?
I swear you said you'd read some fanfics when you were yougner.
younger*
:P
i think he probably would have emailed us thugh, right?
13Nope.
though*
ESPECIALLY Fallout: Equestria
yay upload is done!
Why not, it's wonderful
it's a fanfic
and thus pure and utter shit
robotpinkie - yfw i checked it in editing software, and rendered uploaded and linked bfore even checking. >_< hope it rendere dok lol
That barely involves the mane 6
13Fanfics out there like... Past Sins and Cupcakes and such have made me decide to never read any of them.
Eh, fanfics aren't for everyone.
It's like pony fallout
13Because people are dumb.
lol check it now, Dman?
Warning: Skillz are required to enter this building
the one advantage to being an English major: I can use my elitism to never read fanfics
rootpinkie - will do when dari streams ^_^
Cupcakes was so funny, it's credit to team
:P
valthejean no u! first ,cross and arrow is hillarious, and 2nd 'kindness of strangers' is amazing.
Do you know how many published works are practically fanfics?
A lot
EVERYBODY'S RUSSIAN
Dman Nope. All fanfics, and are by definition shit
They should put that on the buildings that have boring 'Authorized Personelle Only' signs
>implying all published works are good
:P
13I agree with Val.
Lol
lolol
lol, dari pretty much summed it up there
also robotpinkie, like yday, were now watching LOTR 3 on projector, so if i vew we'll hear it thru speakers of 3x2 meter screen xD
6Where is that phrase from, lighty?
NOPE
lol
/me goes trough the door
you're both nuts
haha, oh okay
Idk xD
Though popular stuff isn't always good either.
02Skillz weren't needed
some fics good some fics shit some works good some works shit.
then don't Dman :P
Ray is awesome enough
Oh God, I remember for English we had 'Hard Times' as for an essay.
to go to either extreme is silly
well just look at fanfics
of course they're popular
I've read many MANY VERY good fanfics
Most boring book EVER written.
robotpinkie - will see in stream, but again, no volume
I only read 20 pages of the damn thing.
but nontheless suck ass :P
02:D
Then read the summary on wikipedia instead.
My God.
NO, GREAT EXPECTIONS WAS WORSE
I'll let you know how it sounded, then, Dman
Ever read "Brave New World"?

in any case, we can probably start with just us three
This cloppage cannot be contained by the power of Sethisto!
loool
03XD
i still wanna see twi in this videoloop, ya know
You gunna post it on youtube when the HD one renders?
10Calm and soothing
Dari - i actually dunno >_< should I?
Yeah.
also 60 precent rendered rite now
Definitely
Then make Sethisto post it on EQD
ut but but
HAHA
who wants to ask the questions, and did anyone save the pic links?
oh god that would be awesome
i'm just one me. i don't deserve EQD leave me alone WHAAAA
10Now if I ever get my earphones untangled, I'll listen to it as well
03well
03this is a more upbeat remix
what song was it?
The Twilight one was on EQD.
03learn to read...
RD > Twilight
It must go on EQD.
(doesn't youtube do 1440 now? what if i render for 1440p xD xD XD)
Well Rodman found the frame, right?
im on runescape+on skype call
guys
multitasking
what if 1440p?
I can copy paste the previous interview
INFINET XD
ew runescape
I... won't be able to watch it :P
You probably can't see the different between 1080 and 1440
03^
ok
With vectors.
03so you were able to see the progress bar but not the name of th esong? -_-
yea dari i guess
robotpinkie u can still view at lower aniways
1440? What the hell is this shit? 1600 or bust.
dashite what?
03that's where I found it at first
03well
03a radio station here plays it
but you're already rendering at 1080p, so
1440 is next scale thats commercially gunna be successful
yea i am
03I just looked on YT for remixes until I matched it
Down with your shitty 16x9 aspect ratios!
i'll just 1080p upload i guess...maybe...if i'm not shy which I am
10Sped up
well i'll invite him in to the interview room then, if you've got the questions ready
...
16x10 best
You're uploading it.
well actually
Or you're banned.
:>
Dari ... : O
03yeah
>threat > :>
trolololo
03radio stations here speed everything up
03it pisses me off
trololol
Hipster did you reply to this app? http://s13.zetaboards.com/BronyState/topic/6815810/1/#new
63 percent
03they're like "Nobody plays more music than us", I'm like "that's because your songs are too fast..."
98rok.com if you like rock
10Here too
98rock.com
03well
0395.5 USED to speed stuff up, then they stopped
inb4 this actually gets featured on EqD
03then started again recently :/
had to lower speed of render so VLC would run smoother (it's reading a disk so yea)
10But most of the mainstream songs sound better at a bit faster pace
03^
03the only downside
Robotpinkie i hope to gawd not
03is then when I download the song
i'd like
03I'm like Y U SO SLOW
10Yep
10iTunes is guilty of this
d oa RD and shiver in the corner of my room
on the floor
i voted yes
03EW ITUNES
ok
03mp3 plz
im deleteing itunes lol
Well it's getting sent to Sethisto as soon as it's upploaded.

So.
Yeah.

10Hi
6I cringe whenever I see that. ovo
o lo lol
03^
Well if no one else does, I will.
;.;
....crap u have vid
The link to the video will be emailed to him.
...owait i have 1080 version :P
appÂ£e locked me to use itune$ because of ipod touch syncing
And you will upload the video.
So.
Yeah.
Use Winamp?
i guess i hav 2 upload or ull upload 480p vid
03your fault for having an iPod
Oh, dear searching skills, what have you done.
: /
I heard that Winamp has a iPod plugin
:p
03new ones maybe
alright i'm ready
lol don't worry, you're not taking all the credit alone, Dman :P
03I have iTunes 2.91
i don't think they work for itouches
03the new ones are just stupid
RD what are yo- ... continue
6IL: Oh, we're reminded because of a... memorable person on TST once.
Robotpinkie ur going in credits
03same as the old oens but like 20x bigger filesize
rodman too
and dari cuz he's the clopobsessed brony who wanted it :3
Woo!
Should probably link to the guy with the original Twilight video.
So you won't have to shiver in the corner alone
LOL
03I'm serious
I only use iTunes with mp3 because the rest Ffin SUCKS
Horribly
Yeah, should probably be linked to the Twilight vid
Bah
03plus, the newest Winamp has some super bloat crap
03the auto-tagging
Dari that too ofc did inspire
And winamp ftw
Yes
03it's going to screw up your songs >_>
03plus
and think up a title :3
but vid still renderin let alone uploadin'
03it'll report back to Winamp central about all the pirated songs you play with it
/me hides
03I'm just sticking to 2.91, it does everything I want it to
"Rainbow Dash's special visit"?
H-hi everybrony
03I even have PaceMaker plugin, lets me speed up or slow down songs in realtime :)
lol
something similar to twi title
8Hi Dman
but not identical
Dash, why are you he- O___o
lol
/me uses XMPlay sometimes
phaps.
Which was that title? Its late so I can't really remember it
Hello Dman welcome
Twilight, what are yo- O__o
I hope there's no rant in database about that
oh
02<lighty> I only use iTunes with mp3 because the rest Ffin SUCKS <-- Mp4 files are played nicely on my old PC
Thanks Sathi. Hey Hipster_brony
Dman, I'm just going to ask you a series of questions for the first part of the interview and I want you to answer them to the best of your ability.
"Uhmm, Twilight? What are yo-... O_O"
Hm
03iTunes cannot play videos to save its life
Ok
03even on my i7
WMP > iTunes fotr everything ;P
03^
03though
03Winamp > WMP for music
Yeah
yup thats it
Do you have any questions before we start?
beat me to it robotpinkie >_
hawt
03and Media Player Classic Home Cinema > * for videos
Hmm...nah
well dari kinda beat me
No questions
Winamp and videos are a bad idea
02Rarely I don't like WMP .-.
VLC > WMP / MPC for videos i say
oh so he did
with a stick
03eh
03VLC used to be good
Brb, gotta get something
03but it doesn't really work right anymore LOL
LOL VLC, that's so old now
Dari forgot the Uhmm
what a story mark that was
How many movienights have you attended so far?
031080p
03yay completely suggestive songs?
dari's talking?
since the 3rd. I don't quite know how many there have been exactly, but i've only missed one friday so far.
Maybe I can finally get my story mark for doing that vector
I was at a wedding
lul
vector cutie mark
woof
03anyway
03I need to shower
lol I didn't actually think you'd loop it :P
03it's like 4pm LOL
(my streams on mute so if dari says anything important lemme know if it's good :3)
03and I'm still in pajamas
03which = no
10Who wears pajamas these days? :P
he said that was... interesting :P
Fair enough
What is your availability for moderating?
oops didnt mean to droun him
...clopworthy more like. he speaks in riddles
'i'm talking about Dman, but he can't hear me! so I can say whateever I want. Isn't that true? Yeah that's true.'
:P
Hahahaha thanks btw gggala_
sathi, you should use your colors :D
Now he's talking about how he's changed his mind about RD being best pony, and that's why he stopped the loop
go back to clopping dari
trolololololo
indeed I should
I am normally free all weekend, and pretty much all afternoons. Most mornings too, but as you and some know sathi, i recently moved away from my mum's in UK and in with my dad in Spain, so we've been out most mornings. after this sunday though, most of the time i'll be free. I'm also on during the mornings, at 7am my time, that is 1am EST
Not many are on then, and I sometimes see a brony posting, but no mods at that hour.
Hey
I have a tube of Colgate right here. How pony is that on a scale from 1 to pony?
It seems like the guy who made the Twilight vis
*vid
Made an AJ one as well
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mFPg0ljqZM&feature=related
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "Applejack? I thought Applebuck Season was over! D:" - "Apparently Applejack was requested a lot. ._. Gah, who&#39;s next?! I&#39;ll only do another one if you guys really want me to make another one. Y U PEOPLE DO DIS TO..."
(ah, forgot. reason for busy mornings these few weeks was sorting out documents)
AJ one is pretty good too
eeyup seen it Rodman
7Do you have any experience moderating?
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/collab/src/130115591169.jpg
75 percent rendar
we streamed it yesterday i think
thanks
I have a miniature colgate here... Instant and Lasting Relief!
Ok
Myeah, not as good though :P
got to go now
Yes. I once moderated a videogame stream on saturdays with friends from school, about 3 or 4 years ago.
well
yeah
the AJ vid
i hear dari getting skyped
and in before i quit, everyone !fight Insane_Lugia !
It was pretty quiet, and only a few serious kicks had to be handed out. Just me and a frie,d so I did the kicking, but I never had to ban anyone
what u say?
(He played the games)
7I see. What talents do you bring to the table?
02fail?
Dashite - want that colgate so bad !!!
But, it's my colgate. I need it! I'd have to go buy more if you took this one. :(
This chat is now about toothpaste.
Yeah
I'd like to say i'm fast at searching for things. I've helped a lot of bronies by posting what they requested to make life easier for the streamer, and just generally linked to / quoted what people wanted me to. I also, as I said in the email, read the comemnts, so i'd be able to catch anyone breaking rules or asking for help during the busy friday stream.
or ponies, whatever...
10http://planetpit.com/2011/08/17/justin-bieber-gets-his-way/#more-20246

02@JB
7: What specific ideas do you have to improve Brony Movie Night and help increase viewership?
he can't hear you, dari
That. Is. Awesome.
...talking to me?
Hey Dari, mind streaming this?
talkin' bout how VLC rocks
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44t7mAI1spY&feature=player_embedded
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "[MLP] Rainbow Dash is WINNING" - "duh, WINNING! represents about 20-25 hours of work, probably the most complex video i have done yet. it was really fun to do tho. i hope everyone likes it! o..."
I have no idea, seductive jazz playing
More advertising. It would be an idea to go on other popular brony hangouts and mention a small brief on what Bronystate is, with a link to us, whenever we're about to begin streaming. EQD is pretty much the only place right now that I see us mentioned in, but there's a lot more brony websites that are visited regularly, and we should try and contact the ones
02well, let's just rename it lame street
>seductive jazz plus colgate brushing
02:D?
>mfw
in charge of those websites so as to make ourselves more known
>OH GOD I HAVE NO FACE
keep going
ill let you know in mod chat if i want to chime in
In terms of improving BMN, it's so good as it is, that perhaps some nifty scripts by dari (such as the trivia i'm working on) and perhaps a few small things like links to bronystate memes or something would make the place a little more fun too.
10Good idea
GGgala_ thanks for saying :P
"You'll be like 'can't handle it!' "
7Any other ideas?
Dman: no prob bro
I couldn't handle Dash, true.
roger
A youtube account with favourited vids of the ones we tend to view here. Would be nice to visit, and mods who stream requests would have instant access to popular, and enjoyed, videos
great idea that
mmhm.
Another idea would be to show trailers of next week's movies at some point during previous movie night
we even could use the BronyState account for that
Hmm
I like the youtube idea.
me too
@deadmeter chat
6 chat is 46% dead. (1478)
perhaps a constant livestream of trailers of next week's movies + pony videos we like could be constantly streamed, like a betweenshows stream.
@chatmeter dead
6 dead is 10% chat. (1479)
>_< cuz I.M.B.C.
it's getting better!
it is?
Could set up a constant stream I suppose.
If we had all the videos in our youtube favourites.
Time for some serious firepower
...
found a gif
sorry kinda busy atm would have found it sooner
Nice
Dman: what is this and why can't i stop looking o_0
7Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
She looks so happy
GGgala_, it is your life flashing before your ey-Bwushie bwushie bwushie bwushit
bwushie *
OH GOD THAT TYPO
so sorry
best typo
Epic winning
yeah, i agree
we should definitely do that
I'd love to be able to help out bronies who ask for help on fridays, and be seen, not just be a white text possibly missed due to everyone else being white text. I also, according to NewDCD, can stream videos. I'd need to try it first, but if I could i can stream requests when nopony else is free, and as I said, i'm EST + 6 hours, so i'm awake sometimes when
other bronies are but no mods are
>mfw no one stared at me when I bought ponies today.... until the cashier didn't ask if I wanted it wrapped
I could also, as mentioned in the email, begin streaming the movies, incase sirsprinkles or newdcd is late, as I could download the movies during the week too. Just to keep the BMN timing
It was funny.
Backup streamers.
Always good.
/me yawns loudly
eeeeeeeeeeyup
Yup.
@killedmeter chat
6 chat is 65% killed. (1480)
The other reason I guess is to feel like i'm a bigger part of bronystate. I've made quite a few friends here, and would love to be a moderator, helping everypony whenever I can

I spend a lot of time here, most of my online time in fact, so i'd always be around to have fun with other bronies, keep the rules, and make it fun hopefully. I actually started playing Hangman with _ _ _ _ _ for letters two days ago, and everyone was enjoying that. it would be good to do that in a colour that stood out too :P
please not mouth to mouth :(
sloppiest CPR ever
lol stream something, dari, plz
7Do you have any previous IRC experience?
F.U.N.E.C.P.R.4.1.?
Oh it's pretty hot, really
dat white stuff
Result of looping the Dash vid, dari?
poke
!espeon !sneas !umbreon
:3
I guess I asked for that
Yes, once, with the videogame stream. Unless it's different here, and if it is it wouldn't be difficult to learn, i can pm, kick, ban, etc
what I'd like?
what ws that one with the family comedy?
7That concludes the first part of the interview, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview now.
WE NEED MORE DURRGAN

... talk to my people
So i wouldn't really kick for this, but i'd PM the brony and tell them not to mention any more cupcakes related things in bronystate, or kickings and a possible ban (D: ) will follow
what's the percentage, Dman?
for what?
ah render!
encoding
yeah that
Yeah
I bet you guys can't pronounce Elywen

or narrating, as it were
Dari-reading is best-reading
dat voice
and then.... everypony came
did I ever tell you that you sound like sexy Stewie from family guy?
Oh, definitely a kick with (No rule 34, and that pic is quite suggestive. Read our rules, found linked above and below chat, or you will be banned_
)
Dari says DO IT, Dman
Nope
not even close
YEAH, DO WHAT DARI DOES DMAN
No "filly" in the sentence though
El-oo-wee-en
(I like alliteration)
Halloween
@encodedmeter DMan
6 DMan is 55% encoded. (1481)
didn't even say 'do it colt'
OH GOD
OH GOD
OH GOD NO
i know, mfw that was explained to me
IT'S DURRRRRRRGARRRRRRRRR
However, i'd like to say that i've noticed rules sorta loosen during the week. this is fine, as we're all friends and not new to Bronystate.
YOU'VE CORRUPTED HIM
only 55? lol
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO DARI?
OK EVERYBRONY: video title?
wtf is this game, srsly?
02Very well, installing iTunes and taggin' my music
02:3c
oh btw dari, I played an ep of Outnumbered for my coworkers
this is Mardek RPG: Chapter 2, pinkie
03why would anyone in their right mind use iTUnes
oh shi-, forgot about the title

inb4 awkward Durrgan dialogue, btw
Well repost your name suggestion, Dari :P
...dun want to, but dari will kick if i dont
03>Winamp
"Dash, why are you he- O___o"
Oh okay
02> Pirated Music
06Probably likes it more than that as well :P
im ok eith that
the video is sooo >implying FlutterDash
wait, what video?
"RD Seduce.mp4", of course!
WAIt
Silvermane has not seen it?
this is on the tv!
and my parents are home!
:O
ahahahaha
...
btw dari you should totally continue that hardest puzzle on the internet
... ok, just let me turn down the volume
Fumb Dabric
Lol
wait, isn't this just like the Twilight one?
Suddenly game music.
Dammit.
lol, so sound for me :P
mfw i can hear Mardek finally
lolol RPG sound
"Rainbow Dash has joined your party!"
no*
(why is she looking at you like that...)
if only....
4Artist: 12 DragonForce 4Track: 12 Black Fire 4Album: 12 Valley of the Damned 4Time: 12 5:47 .
wait, am I the only one who can't hear any sound?
I'll freeze chrome's flash player
Sec.
02Well it works
same reason Twilight did last week?
lol, haven't seen that before, it's kinda cute :3. So aniway, again, during the week it isn't TOO much so it would probably pass, as i've seen other mods let these sorta things pass during the week. However, on a movie night, it's hard to say. I suppose i'd PM them with a warning, and also warn them, for others to see the warning, in Bronystate Channel. somet
02But it borks with / join
Dari, you could just close the game; you havent' made any progress yet
"Pinkie Pie has joined your party! Party upgraded to PAR-TAY!"
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH
hing like 'Remember to read our rules, linked above and below the chat. No r34, and i'd also ask no more pictures with the sort of content that picture had, [bronyname
] )
prepare your bodies
mfw it's just like the Twilight one, except her wings look odd, and she seems... chubby
no but seriously, I'm not hearing anything
7okay, moving on to the last image:
How many times have you played this?
7http://www.ponychan.net/chan/collab/src/130115591169.jpg
not enough times, Ziltoid
... oh wow
I'm gona restart my browser...I'm not getting any sound
>mfw the video hypnotizes everyone into killing chat for the second time
anybody like tool?
or blooddrunk
whuh? There's chat?
kick with more severe message, as that's some kissing and very bloody. maybe: (Don't post anything gory, or suggestive, or you will be banned.)
HHHNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGG
Don'y kill me.
:<
Don't*
again, (rules found above and below chat)
DONY
kill dari please
unless it's same pony paraspriting, in which case more kick, followed by ban if they should continue
@pony the pony who permanently froze Google Chrome
6 the pony who permanently froze Google Chrome is 3Granny Sm15ith
Do I need to explain to him that this image would result in a ban?
Rainbow Dash Don'y is best Don'y
Meh, we can explain to him if we hire him I suppose.
sorry robotpinkie dari won't upload. at least not for like 3 more hours. I.M.B.C.
dammit Granny! who taught you about the magic boxes whippersnappers use these days
I would just say that's the end of the interview for now.

Hey Dari would it be a good idea to remove 'is'?
would you mind kicking my alt?
i had to quickly un-max screen my ps3 video of bronystate, mute the tv, then hide the chat because my fucking mom walked in right in the middle of sexy-dash-stare
we could make SILLY things
since the son of a bitch wont disappear
and also dari is it possible to make a script to replace '@pony'?
7Alright, that was the last part of the interview.
so we could have:
/me came
fkdjsa;fkdsa;fds @pony jfdsal;ieowrd @pony kfjeiowpresa
The script should be altered so it uses a set line depending on what is input
?
ty
Would be so awesome dari
10Never heard of either
lol silvermane
Ok then
7Do you have anything to add?
dethklock??
okay how the hell
/me plays stream.
Thjis been on the whole time?
lol kick the alt and then quit?
Wut
you kicked the alt, yet it STILL wont let me use my name
he said everypony came... although it'll be awkward to explain to MirthTinker, considering what we were doing at the time
EEYUP
hmm ill add them to my playlist when i get around to it.
Tool is good
Of course it won't.
It's still connected to the server.
Only to thank all the mods for their hard work on Bronystate, I love you all
well yeah, quit so I can change my god damn name
Kicking it doesn't DC it.
blooddrunk is metal, as well as deathklock

For a ping timeout to occur
7Please be around next BMN show as we will announce further recruitment updates there

I hasnt got oot
JELLY OF UR MANE 4 btw
Never played it too
Oh it's mane 6 now, Dman :3
/me aims it at LU
My eyes cant handle the 3DS, thats because of that stupid tunnel vision!
. . .
12>:|
Is.
this.
Nuuuu
true?
u jelly?
Its my eyes their fault!
/me snugs LL :3
I actually need glasses for the tunnel vision
No actually, not one bit jelly, but extremely happy for you
is it true then?
u bought shy and the other one?
Yeah, I had to :P
wai
12then turn the 3D off D:
you have Fluttershy?
!!!!!!!!!! AWESOME
superfluous words are superfluous
Applejack, yep
you lucky bastage
i have nothing but a backpack
Im not even thinking of buying that!
me neither
robotpinkie - i wanna buy aj with the pink hat and paint it brown :3
NO 3DS HERE!
I would play OoT but my stupid sis is hogging the TV atm
so robotpinkie what u gonna get next? also did u get them all standalone?
I only have the mane 6 brushables, though
inb4 he has his way with her, and it is consensual
ah
oh
Yeah it's kinda lacking in hat
that was beautiful
If i get that tunnel vision, i grow dizzy and unstable, if i get that on the bike while im speeding with 24KM/H....
In spain near me are two double sets as u know. 'Rainbow Dash and Rainbow Cloud' and 'Fluttershy and Daisy Dreams'
Well....
that was a beautiful french accent for durrrrrrgarrrr
I got shy one, getting RD one soon.
Yup, standalone, no set available that I could find
Not even thinking of that....
: /
brb
id like standaolne
hey hey importaint:
inb4 he rapes Durrgan
did ur fluttershy come with like a trolley and female angel thing?
and purple brush?
Kk
and I can't justify spending money on something that could give me a headache
Yeah, well I don't think brush is purple
but female angel bunny, yeah
oh?
mine is
and yea D:
That thing can hurt my eyes and cause serious injuries.....amnesias......broken bones....
good then, glad double sets are same sets then
The 3DS has never given me a headache :P
So, yea
So you're a bunch of sissies
:3 merch for the win
make sure you have all your shit equipped
12^
the 3DS gave me a headache when I tried it
but : ( Spain, at least near me, only got rd and shy
well I guess it's like... very pale purple maybe
silvermane - u know dis game?
I thought of it as pink :P
so I am not buying that piece of crap
Well maybe...you did it wrong
the DS will be my last Nintendo system EVER
robotpinkie reason i said purple cuz in double set it's yellow shy with 'pink' brush, and next it's purple 'daisy dreams' with yellow brush
Or you didn't spend the time to even try to adjust the 3D so you don't get a headache
Dman, i've put over 70 hours in the series
so kinda compared the two :3
02well, I give up x-x
Silvername - Nice

Tally Ho mother fucker
If you press the Right Arrow key when targeting an ally, you may cause the spell to target All Party, halving the effect, doubling the cost, but hitting everyone
same for enemies, but using the left key
that totally needs to be the catch phrase when you last hit people
"Tally Ho mother fucker"

Valthejean this si golden
Flail is OP
02And ffs?
:P
oh god whats it gonna do
I'll explain it dari:
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
first
THIS IS SO GOOD
Flail is an extremely OP attack
02go and die in a fire, script
gains speed during rain
which means he moves first
smeargle used an ability that increases attack
then baton passed
no wai
still going
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
FLAWLESS VICTOREE
flail does more damage the less health you have
How pissed was the other guy
>1 hp
during the rain
with 1 hp
he had 1 hp left
i no rite
that video was legendary
the odds were EXTREMELY stacked
dari:
What a tweest eh
have you ever seen F.E.A.R ratatta?
lolwut? generations have changed, man
...
valthejean post it
guys, i have a confession to make
nao, wanttosee
it never did any damage back in the day did it?
not sure if there's a vid of it
but I'll look
you see, i'm really 3 bokes
oh ok ..
Completely fair... plus awesome
blokes*
Ll~
*LL~
ill just explain it
a ratatta
silvermane silvermare ain't no bloke
has the item that endures to 1 hp
so
the enemy attacks you
you have 1 hp
yea
you use endeavor
Dman, oh you.
(makes their hp equal to you)
then
what im srs silvermane
quick attack
boom
Hahaha! valthejean, what a troll
But, mom. THERE's WILD POKEMON IN THE TALL GRASS
level 16 ratatta killing a level 100 anything
that's also pretty funny
i know Dman, quite intimately actually
:P
and THAT
silvermane - stuff in rp?
is F.E.A.R Ratatta
i fear it
oh
I remember the acronym now
moar?
nothing yet Dman, Dermathil considering time-skipping his story, waiting for Topaz to respond
thanks f' letting me know
so silvermane still at ...
But we've already bonded. I named him Mr. Fish
(F)ocusBand(E)ndeavor,Quick(A)ttack,(R)atatta
@Edward: Did you use him to bludgeon other creatures? :P
@ponymeter RobotPinkie's battle station
6 RobotPinkie's battle station is 19% pony. (1493)
lol valthejean nice
Dman, still at ...
?
Needs more pony.
As of Gen 5, you can use any Pokemon with the Sturdy ability in place of Focus Band
silvermane it's ok i asked dermathil for doc
12XD
12hai Chime :3
What?
the logic
silvermane - TON of stuff i missed. i left when it was just getting on with demrathil and topaz. g2 read scene :P
it sucks ass
YAY!
In gen 5, Sturdy protects any Pokemon that has it from any attack that would KO it in one hit, even if they aren't one-hit ko moves
awwww
I wanted Durrrrgurrr dead :(
I am not amused :P
Dman, get ready for saucy followed by dawww
fuck durrgarr and his manboyish hair and lack of character
Which leads to a lvl 1 Aron with Shell Bell defeating a Level 100 Pokemon
but but but... durrgan goes An Hero on us
silvermane i read all but last 5 posts. dawwww indeedio, though
so i missed a little
not much thou
and Endevour
Use the Force Dari!
Endeavor

or in other words, use some trippy magic shit
dat drill metaphor, Dman.

but someponyelse might not have known :P
inb4 AE forgets to go to SC :B
Dman: read his parts again :p
/me overly floofed
oh?
wasn't thinking bout drills when read it
g2 reread then
fuck durrgarr
you get more exp if he's dead
13We bought a new mouse today, so I'm gonna see if I can get it to work |D
because his personality is that of a DURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
what GGgala_ u mean the progressively ... *deeper* each time part?
ValtheJean, exp comes from doing things, not party-share system. Mardek's exp is not effected by other paty members, as long as he deals killing blow
06:3

/me cling
!espeon
:3
you realize I'm not being serious, right?
GGgala_ and Dman, lol dat reference

/me Due to extensive research done by the Fourchon University of Science, diamond has been confirmed as the the hardest metal known the man. The research is as follows.

/me Pocket-protected scientists built a wall of iron and crashed a diamond car into it at 400 miles per hour, and the car was unharmed.
you did now
/me They then built a wall out of diamond and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an out into the wall, and the wall came out fine.
/me They then crashed a diamond car made of 400 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors.
oh you kids and your touhou
brb, making that a meme now
/me They crashed 400 miles per hour into a diamond traveling at iron car. Western New York was powerless for hours.
/me They shot a diamond made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused two wayward airplanes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with two buildings in downtown New York.
/me They spun 400 miles at diamond into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive.
/me Finally, they placed 400 diamonds per hour in front of a car made of wall traveling at miles, and the result proved without a doubt that diamonds were the hardest metal of all time, if not just the hardest metal known the man.
And THAT is science
