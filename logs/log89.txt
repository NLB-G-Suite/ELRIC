Eat the kid.
And 3G is terrible
:P
DO EET
No thanks
I am simply trying to say something that is actually constructive
DON'T SAY THAT VAL
Protagonists die later.
It's created lines and sentences
yours are bashing
You'll have to wait.
eh...the show just doesn't catch my attention
>game of thrones
you just bashed the iPad
and cellular data services
I'm just stating a fact
it kinda bores me tbh
I don't know
those are OPINIONS
3G can be very slow
not facts
4G is fast compared to 3G
not a fact
Fixed; just had to Reinsert it
But you never even got to the predators.
shhh
And Becker.
3G can be slow compared to Wifi
OH YEAH
lol
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FUTURE PREDATORS.
can you get WIFI out on the highway?
BITCHES DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY HORRIBLE MONSTERS
eh...if the first episode can't sell it for me, I don't watch the show
Lawl.

The first two episodes of FiM didn't sell it for me.
I'm still gladI continued watching.
Yes

well, that's you :P

honestly
it shud load it
No one needs to be connected all the time
Did it stop loading?
My fault.
I was screwing around with the packets it was sending earlier.
Dman, that won't work.
Connection to the server is broked. XD

I'd just like a service that doesn't cut out and require cards to work?

You hope :P
Never trust wireless period
like?
They came from the rift in space/time that goes through Cardiff
LOL
LOL
Kinda
HAHAQHA
much of it is due to the physics of the frequencies used
it begins...
GSM phones typically use three bands
My Little Primeval: Anomalies are Magic
800 MHz, 900 MHz, and 1.8 GHz
You can be right next to the radio station, and still get a bad signal :P
high UHF
that is due to the signals being very much line of sight
I think CDMA uses the same bands too
That'd be sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!
LOL
I dunno
but then again, Skyrim is coming out...
but...I just don't want to get my hopes up again
HELLEN
government allocations
false
quality
It's nothing like... completely revolutionary
and bandwidth
and bandwidth required
You can only be disappointed
I am always way too hyped?
LESTER
LESTER IS COOLIO
*call
Why can't we just use both
Lester the Unlikely
analog audio uses less bandwidth
Lester wins:
an average FM broadcast station uses 150 KHz of bandwidth
TV uses about 6 MHz of bandwidth
And wifi?
WIFI uses maybe 10 or 20 MHz
Lester wins
(You don't know nothing about the predators.)
that way you probably won't be disappointed
gtg guys
and wifi is around 50-100 mbit/s
people using WIFI are actually SECONDARY

2.4 GHz is primarily an amateur radio allocation worldwide
and a Microwave allocation XD
well yes it is

now Serv-chan, on the other hand....
hard to broadcast "standard" radio from center of downtown here XD
IT KNOWS
(you ain't heard an evil laugh 'til you heard mine. Tell 'em, Dman.)
at the 4th floor of an apartment building
on FM I guess
you have to deal with lots of multipath due to reflections from buildings
CONNECTION PROBLEMCEPTION!
Around here, I'm a roller coaster nerd :P
with AM you don't have to worry about that too much
but sadly most people own AM receivers that are to be honest a piece of junk
telephone quality sound
(Dermathil redefines evil laughs)
Bitches please!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J1HqdQl6dw&feature=related
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "Zim&#39;s Laugh!" - "Zim&#39;s Laugh!"
well
I have a few wideband AM receivers
the AM ones sound very much like mono FM
inb4 GAH BEEEEEEES
There are very few AM stations around here
AM is being vacated in Europe
pretty much no AM in sweden
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZs39wggIW4
I guess it's time for some........ refreshments...
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "Invader Zim - Bees" - "Invader Zim Yells about Bees"
including shortwave and longwave
exactly
Wow
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qTQEJjt9n0&feature=related
That's too bad
and shortwave
radio sweden exists on internets though
through DRM
meh
kind of pointless though
kill it
I saw one like that fly inside my hamburger one day.
kill it
and buffering
Hornets are the cutest creatures on earth
I threw it in the garbage bin
until they fucking bite you
AM, although not as high quality as FM, is still a pretty reliable source for information
the glass is upside down
implying the person trapped it there
Except to bees
the issue is partially receivers
You can get it a lot easier than F
like I mentioned
FUCK THOSE GUYS, KILL EM WITH FIAR!!!!!
another issue is sadly the growing levels of electrical interference
phff, then she's fucking stupid
Yup
because he'll come back with his hornet friends
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!
Dari, mind showing the picture of the brits in line to plunder a shop?
and come to fucking kill her
NOT THE BEES!
I hate hornets
they kill beees
NOT THE BEES!!!!!
that helps with most problems
and feed the bee corpses to their young
/me fires the bees in a kiln.
unfortunately its the expensive ones that do
Dman, how's it coming?
We didn't listen to much AM on my mom's Toyota Highlander
HEY I DON'T KILL BEES
BEE LOVER!
did you bring that over from the US?
interesting fact:
VOLUME HIGHER
Yup
you can't anyway
Previously, on Paradise Beach
Einstein predicted the end of society would begin with the extinction of bees
wrong band step
2003 Toyota Highlander; comes with the stock Toyota radio
as I mentioned before
I AM sorta afk on it too thou
stupid kid in the room
aw...
because
you have to pay for it
I can't listen to AM here in Italy?
yah
megavideo pays for the copyright
oh wait
no
I'm wrong
That's why the bill in the US was trying to illegalize streaming
some vids on megavideo do get removes
removed*
Oh good
They want to take websites like Megavideo down
because that tuner is designed for the US 10 KHz band step
it depends on whether or not the companies bother to send the cease and desist
yeah
yeah
I've seen a few get removed
not the 9 KHz band step used in Asia, Europe, Oceania, and Africa
someone puts them BACK pretty quickly
I'll have to listen to it in my dad's 1998 Alfa Romeo 156
but they do get removed
exactly
that one might include longwave too
That should work, then
its kind of a neat band
*got
under the right conditions you can hear all of Europe at night
HAHA
hahaha
LOOOOOOL
It has a Pioneer faceplate but a stock Alfa radio, I believe
OF COURSE!
HAHAHAHA
Awwww yeaaaaaah!
that Toyota radio can tune in a few 9 KHz step frequenceis
for example 1440
but on that one there might be a problem from time to time
you might hear HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
because that transmitter is owned by RTL in Germany
eh, the playthroughs are boring
Stream Amnesia
and they run DRM transmissions much of the time

I remember hearing HD radio for the first time
It was pretty cool
you could play 20 questions to the challenge I gave you yesterday :P
Try redoing the process you did before?
didn't you turn it into a gif before to make it work?
DRM is about the same thing on MW/LW/SW
watch this episode
Sooooo clear xD
we have cable radio here XD
except its an open standard
yeah!
I'm just going to sleep right now
Do that!
Or...
Doo eet
in fact I like DRM a bit more than AM HD Radio
okay dari
you have ONE ep to prove to me its worth :P
Would I be able to adjust our car's radio to get 9 KHz?
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
and might experiment with DRM on the standard AM broadcast band
maybe
OH YES.
I'd usually just mute it and go to work <.< >.>
where soldering experience is manditory
Could you do it?
We've watched the entire first series already
Yeah
I might be able to do this kind of mod
if a microcontroler is involved with tuning
We're like... one season away

03there's 3 discs total, but you probably don't need the second two
12what's on the other 2?
03and the other is uh
03Business Contact Manager
12yeah XD
03it's a whole 5MB, don't know why it's on its own disc LOL
12all i need is excel and word
03OK
03what OS are you using?
froogy diggy dig hole plot
12windows 7, 64 bit
rofl
>milk tea
03OK
Tea with milk?
12i'd like it to work with my other laptop too though, vista 32 bit
wut
03well
/me huggles Lightlugia
03the disc has both 32 and 64 bit versions
voulez vous coucher avec Twilight ce soir?
/me urks
03if you just do the autorun, it only installs 32-bit
That is pretty good french you've got there. And a French Canadian's saying that.
12i see
Oui
03if you open up the disc and use the setup inside x64, that's the 64-bit one
03up to you XD
(he means Yes)
12well
OH YESAH?
REALLY?
12i can install on both right?
12lol
(:3)
1264 bit for one and 32 bit for the other
I took French for 5000 years
actually just one
03yeah
03on the 32-bit, just run the setup normally
OH YEAH, WELL I TOOK LATIN FOR 3
...it was terrible
03for the 64-bit, just open the disc and manually run it
I took Latin for 5.
:P
Did it for GCSE.
I took latin for 7
oh yeah well I learned English from a dictionary I found in a dumpster, beat THAT!
umad?
You did it for A level?

12lol
13!espeon
/me now belongs to Angel_Espy|Touhou for 19 minutes
03LOL 128-bit wouldn't even make sense
03the reason they came out with 64-bit was that 32-bit had a limitation of about 3GB of RAM
062tb ram oh wow
When Crysis 34 comes out
DERP
HAHAHA
A lot
12i heard of some 32 bit thing with time though
12where in 2032 there makes some sort of loop
12http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem
03ah yeah
03that
03That's a UNIX thing though
12XD

12i'm going to be really worried
06But 256TB for AMD64
trololololo
03o.o

03you know how with rebates
sending yourself money much ?
03they send you prepaid credit cards?
/me nods
03is I have two paypal accounts
03I add the card to one
03then send the value, this case $25, to the other
03XD
12ah XD
12also
03of course I lose like a dollar each time as a stupid processing fee
o.o
03but w/e
12the B&tB DVD/BR is here naos
12I remembered to grab it
03for some reason though, the $40 one I got the other day won't work in paypal, I'm kinda annoyed
03which means I have to go to an actual store and spend exactly $40
12XD
03I don't get it though
03American Express prepaid cards usually just work
03I've gotten like 10 of them now and this is the first one that paypal can't authorize :/

I bet you can't beat this: http://www.deathball.net/notpron/
Congrats
hehehe
same here
that thing is HARD.
Pfft
(the website has been visited 15 million times)
I'm pretty sure with 300 viewers ALL participating to help we couldn't beat it.
:P
checking forums
Pfft
checking for the answer specifically
except that, you can use pretty much anything.
'dankes
You are going to need to use the source code and various files and sound decoders and image decoders and a SHITTON of other programs.
*Will Nittany Tiger get noticed today. Find out now!"

10We'll take a vote then
VOODOOPOPR?

Good boy

10Dang, I was about to write it down

Handy
get a million people to write on a petition
orly
"griggs should cut off his own dick"
(the entire page is used, not just the images. Look everywhere)
he won't do it
he wouldn't be a sexpert without it
I enjoy using it too much
Yeah, the title of the page hints at that.
That too
<title>Look in the dark...</title>
LET US TALK ABOUT MASTURBATION
I don't sex myself ):
/me sit down
do others sex you?
`-`
EdwardNewgate, no
I did
You CAN beat it without cheating.
Once or twice
Have you?
You pretty much need to be a genius and know computers really wel.
And no.
That it doesn't even work.
might have been twice
Actually I think 3 times
And I'm not even sure whether that pokerstarts thing is an ad or a clue.
it is an ad
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/funny-facebook-fails-a-manual-virus.jpg

12took me awhile to get that one drf
Hey everyone
Hey.
Ok, thanks.
really
only 23 people in the world beat it
and 15 million people tried it
gototheothersite.htm
And yes, I just pulled in a scene from Looney Toons Back in Action
what's the address?
try /false/gototheothersite?
False was the previous level.
then that line is related to the previous level
http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/476864
Also, Applejack is a Time Lord. Reason: She wears a Stetson. And Stetsons are cool.
works for me
>Smith reference
Bloodlust...Rising...
I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool.
Smith makes everything he touches horribly uncool.
What's the link to the start of the puzzle again?
Haven't done one of those in a while.

Considering I saw "pron" back when I was in college, in '03
it's not painful perse
(Well, actually it was usually pr0n)

probably too much pony porn
>.>
<.<
...perhaps
it doesn't make sense, though. it says to contact support@dinkypage.com, which means dinkypage was suspended by themselves?
Hi! :D
maybe they closed down while they deal with the email hack?
also, scootabuse
make scootalove, not scootabuse
sweetiebuse > scootabuse
isn't the email hack for Mibbit and not Dinkypage?
YOU DID IT DARI

You have to highlight it.

Because if it is I'm unlikely ever to get it.
I was just trying to add a dramatic effect :p

what's a shame
Hershey bars are usually made in Hershey, Pennsylvania
Honestly, that doesn't look like any wrapper I've ever seen
He went to the old school...
I thought you were just joking.
No one's been ignoring you.
The term 'used' in that sentence Griggs
oh

Well, no-one been answering.
Oh wait past tense used
Man I'm slow tonight
haha
He went to the old school...
It turns out I earned an extra hour of overtime.
12Light_Latias uses blue text
I don't know how anyone normally would respond to working a lot, but many coworkers haven't responded well.
And it's not a bad job.
It's just stressful.
I just need a break here.

It was a twix.
Oh

(but it IS a twix. check the older names0

Well, I'm sorry for accusing you for ignoring me. Just thought you were when I never got a shout back from my hellos.
Ok.
Maybe they acknowledged you in other ways?
alright
but either way, not everyone responds to me
Maybe.
It was raider.
Dari, we can't hear you
Old name for Twix bars apparently.
Put backwards.
In the URL bar.

Lol
Gardner's ruining the third dimension, but that's only one piece of information I need something else
12lol
For username/password
um
Something to do with a .GIF?
hmmm
I give up :P
<!--GIF me my picture back-->
Are the 2 images in gifs?
or if they were each named something else
12o-O
and only one of them was a gif
12heh
Ahh
12not good enough
I renamed the pic
On the site.
nice
Changed the URL
from jpg to gif
awesome
the difference between the two pics
Hmm
the remote shakes
that's the only thing that actually changes
yeah
everything else is perspective change
click the remote
12twilight
Nothing.
hmmm
Password: remote?
12lol
"attention whore"
I suppose the remote
Is the attention whore?
Because it's moving around?
makes sense
I tried both remote and gardner in either position.
Hmmm.....
are you sure gardner is one of them?
Which is Gardner.
Maybe his cat's the attention whore?
but what's the cat's name?
and then what's the point of the gif?
Hmm
I dunno.
12played it before
12XD
12wasn't that i didn't want to
is there a remote in this vid at all?
12i just couldn't figure out how
12i knew it had something to do with that machine
12umm
?
12I finished Colosseum
12and XD
Too hard to see what's in it.
:P
12^
you're sure there's no audio?
/me playing Metroid Prime again o.o
controller?
12instead of using one of the normal starters we pick our own starter
instead of remote?
12i've considered it
I'll try it.
alright
Oh.
change it to remote maybe?
(stereo/mono)
Newest chapter of Romancing Quest is.... Interesting.
wasn't mus1 for the other thing?
Actually.
Switch pics probably is a hint for changing jpg to gif
Ohh.
The gif.
It's just the two images on the page put one after the other.
yeah
...
XD
also
the 12 movws
moves*
yes
Oh yeah.
hello again
hello barry
Gardner's ruining the 3rd dimension that's for sure...
How are ya, Val
it's the attention whore we need to figure out
I'm good, how about you?
I'm good
remote controller? The composite word we haven't tried yet
@finemeter
6 You are 64% fine. (1475)
mfw it was just a case sensitive clue
Oh wait.
Maybe it's not Gardner ruining the third dimension?
Just the remote?
because gardner's face is all fucked up
It's the only thing that moves.
In the picture.
like watch the vid again
his face fucking deforms
Becuase the remote moves it screws up 3d.
Hmm
That still leaves us just with remote though?
well, even if it's the remote that breaks the 3rd dimension
where do we input that info?
where do we go with that?
Yeah, and the clue is "attention whore"
It has to be the remote.
Remote?
maybe just controller?
instead of remote controller
Ahh, good point.
remote for one
controller for the other
Hmm
Maybe remote and control?
WINNING!
Oook.
Next page.
"no maths
"
Dialog pops up
3of5
There's the pictures from 10 and 13 and 4.
Hmm.
check all the numbers
Ohh.
see on the wall?
You hover over certain parts and different.
yeah
2 of 5
5 of 5
3 of 5
find the numbers in the right order?
1 2 3 4 5
/me hops up and down, making squeaking noises.

Excellent
yes, happey
hmm...
i see Twilight in him
he is a paladin :P
where exactly did this happen?
because Baldur's gate was completely open ended
Damn, you should narrate
umm, you leave the starting town, go through the woods towards the East, and it's right outside a building in the next area
it means:
add them up
then add 3
Remember kids
yeah, that's because you wandered into a higher level area
When bullets hit you, you don't die
but, it was a town
Numbers come out and THEY KILL YOU!
and i didn't even have a map
and he just fucking attacked me because i was me
nor listens to the plot

03<Glacymr> drf i agree with you that da is a bit nuts at times but why boycott them drf? <- because someone has to?
03XD

04o-o
honestly call it a crutch but iblame the add i had when i was in 2nd grade couldnt sit still to learn
03the correct answer is USA
03Florida is not a country :P
drf no 1 asked for a politically correct answer.
/me lols at auto script

03my mIRC doesn't even have the slapping with a large trout crap
03you're also a n00b
03so yeah.
03that wasn't necessary.
04wow
04I'm surprised he didn't get kicked
neither is degradeing others by calling them noob
03it's not degrading if it's the truth
wel when drf starts it how do you expect someone to react?
03^
03Insane_Lugia, just ignore it
03that being said

Insane_Lugia, he doesn't degrade others
Ever heard of "joking"?
theres other ways to joke with out putting others down for swotwear they use et
etc
03I'm impressed, actually.
I suggest you do the latter
03^
03that sentence made no sense
06Sounds somewhat like me. I like everyone until they've made themselves deserve otherwise :P
04Insane_Lugia, you've just made yourself look bad by attacking him. The end.

very briefly, yes
did you like it?
6Hey..Sry but I can't stay.. >.<
eh....not really
it probably didn't help that my friend was talking it up like crazy
:(
he always complained my games weren't realistic enough
12what the heck are you playing
Was it the visuals (textures, models, lighting, etc) that you didn't like?
You may not want to see him... mzybe... if you have the guts...
Really?
*maybe
12o.o
it was mostly the frustration with the combat system
Do you wish to see him...
I'm playing Stunt Biker
(Stalker's REALLY realistic. Gunfights are very fluids when you get the hang of it0
eh, I disagree on the realism
This is all I have... may he frolic in paradise, and puppy heaven... :'(
6What? o.o
/me playing Beyond Good and Evil (the demo, anyway)
yes, he used that same excuse too
12i was t alking to Espeon XD
He's gone c7...
Gone...
with much higher accuracy
pup-pup, bo, our bulldog...
6DD:
:'(
6I'm really sorry..
Not sure I'd say it's realistic just because it has crap guns...
6Sry,gtg >.<
And this is all I have left of him... http://ayumi-wolf-dragon.deviantart.com/gallery/?catpath=scraps#/d46vwx6

I hated the graphics and the accuracy too.

12I'm playing the 360 version of LoZ
LOL
o.O
second I would say
considering it has everything from the first

I'd suggest playing a little longer. You should get the hang of the fighting pretty quickly.
12she even has a 4-letter name o-x
12ew
12wat is?
it's magic
I made that mistake with FF13
i'm playing gran turismo on my megadrive
and I've only regretted it
12lol
I can understand for FF13.
Might get that soon, then
also
(can you shoot the lights out in Fallout?)
anyone heard of "nanashi no game"
(also, the underground complexes/dungeons are insanely well designed.)
lol
Let's try one more
Mmmmm Gran Turismo
Afternoon.
8Hey Cross
12aaaand demo done
orly?
Hello.
actual Baldur's Gate or shitty ps2 Baldur's Gate?
Hello.
Can do.
polyphony can't keep deadlines
Yup, gonna make may through that and the expansion, then it's BG2 and its expansion
dunno if you have the others
good :P
12oh nooooo...
Paladin
GT5 is pretty good
lol, nowai! I'm playing a Pally for like, the first time this run through
I never do normally, but eh
But yeah, that should've come out 2 years ago instead of last November
haha
..eww..
...yeah
No
nothing makes that picture
oh
you should download that BG1 mod that lets you pick BG2 classes and such
that one has been vaporware for well over a decade
because you'll want to be one of the specialized paladins
I didn't know there was such a thing
/me sighs
yeah
12brb x.x
and it only JUST NOW was released
can't remember the name
kk
but the difference is
well then in that case forget it :P
(if you get that)
not me
...unless I rly like the Paladin, but I doubt it :P
yeah...paladin's in BG1 were kind of sucky
:P
plus you could recruit Ajantis
and he was fucking ballin
I have one out of a 1959 Chevy on the work bench now
Hey.
oh look! it's that whore dari!
Hello, again Dari

I have just about found the problem too

he wasn't very clear on the challenge
well, it's a little redundant to ask questions that we already have answered on the application, dont you think?
I'd think they'd be allowed to take ringers from ID

I'd like to think you have a good set-up, the only thing I can really see as needing change is having back-ups to the planned streamers and checking for technical hiccups before screening, but that's more of a background thing, and something I'm sure you're already well aware of.

Barry - whut
srsly whut
@Barry of course. Harry Potter fans are fucking crazy
dr who*
Harry Potter is basically the REASON shipping is still popular
sheeppeeng
wait really?
lol
...oh yeah, sorry about the confusion |D
EVERYONE, ABANDON SHIP!
you haven't seen shipping until you've seen harry potter shipping
i wasn't even into shipping much, even thou a lot of my friends were, till FiM
I read a harry potter shipping fic once
03thanks
Wellfuck.jpg
how does that work thou?
Avatar shipping.
/late
I know. I'm looking at the interview now.
Octopus*
12np
Barry lol
Dman, you don't want to know
03you
just whut that fanfic
03XD
12anth causing you confusion
12or me
12XD
03you for chaning the topic
03*changing
12ok
12[13:45:01] <Anth-Umbreon> ...oh yeah, sorry about the confusion |D
12[13:45:18] <drfsupercenter> thanks
12had to make sure :P
Harry Pothead fans can take even the SLIGHTEST of phrases and make the biggest fucking contradictions ever
03XD
:p
It also has Dumbles bashing
or write fics
Yea
Dman: >implying canon ships get in the way of shipping
I would say nothing:
ajksfhkjsdh
agh XD
also, there ere YEARSbefore the last book came
I would only link (if I had it) the picture of Pinkie saying "Give her time"
*there were years
02back
of course cannon ships would get in the way. have you seen those things?
oh no, they even disregard canon ships
I'd say he did pretty well and would make a good mod.
they're a case of fandumb
Dman: people were insanely delusional that Harry/Hermione would become canon, even after five books. o_0
wb
Dman: orly?
oh dear, gggala_
and Ya rly
how was it
I have 2 things to say about it:
eeeeeeeeeeeeeyup
and 2?
?
also, brb
>2:30
12wb
oh
Yeah
02Thx
I had the same reaction to it
Dman is 3:30
was thinking of Dman
edwardnewgate no
Yea barry
I mean, 'I got my 'I' on you!'
Dman: yeah people make a bigger deal out of it than it warrants. I think at one point #BronyState mods said 'no more talking about cupcakes' even
I just won't read it because of the severe lack of grammar
It doesn't ruin anything for me, I just think it's really badly written.
Yea GGgala_ i got told that too
well then, we've done a great job about following that rule
Dari - i'm saying it was brilliant!
It's not badly written if you read the updated version.
Dari - ionly read updated one
13Never read it.
where is that?
13:P
it's not that bad
no
Eh, guess I should read the updated version
13I don't read any fanfics haha.
no edwardnewgate, link phaps?
13Hello Val.
same
If you want it, I can find it again. It's pretty bad
eyup
edwardnewgate - if it's bad, then eh
13Eeeyup.
hmmm
I swear you said you'd read some fanfics when you were yougner.
younger*
:P
i think he probably would have emailed us thugh, right?
13Nope.
though*
Why not, it's wonderful
it's a fanfic
and thus pure and utter shit
That barely involves the mane 6
Eh, fanfics aren't for everyone.
13Because people are dumb.
lol check it now, Dman?
Warning: Skillz are required to enter this building
:P
Do you know how many published works are practically fanfics?
A lot
They should put that on the buildings that have boring 'Authorized Personelle Only' signs
>implying all published works are good
:P
13I agree with Val.
Lol
lol, dari pretty much summed it up there
lol
you're both nuts
haha, oh okay
Idk xD
02Skillz weren't needed
some fics good some fics shit some works good some works shit.
then don't Dman :P
to go to either extreme is silly
well just look at fanfics
of course they're popular
I've read many MANY VERY good fanfics
Most boring book EVER written.
I only read 20 pages of the damn thing.
02:D
Then read the summary on wikipedia instead.
NO, GREAT EXPECTIONS WAS WORSE
I'll let you know how it sounded, then, Dman

GGgala_ thanks for saying :P
"You'll be like 'can't handle it!' "
7Any other ideas?
great idea that
mmhm.
Another idea would be to show trailers of next week's movies at some point during previous movie night
Hmm
me too
perhaps a constant livestream of trailers of next week's movies + pony videos we like could be constantly streamed, like a betweenshows stream.
>_< cuz I.M.B.C.
it is?
Could set up a constant stream I suppose.
