I was legally blind for about 3 and a half days
all I could make out were vgue blurry images
08,01Mega_Milk: i've got a retina injury from a laser; blindness solidarity /)
08,01it doesn't actually bug me all that much, actually
Mega_Milk, Everlasting_Joy, freedom is on the ropes. And it's going to take stuff like this to invoke divine providence. My fast will end shortly after the election.
08,01it's a dark spot in my peripheral vision
Kandarihu: Lolwat?
Kandarihu: I do have to ask you to elaborate.

WallDives: Black 2?
Pokemon.
:).
I cant remember the last time I've played that game -lol
Well
I played ponymon
Last one I played was Crystal.
but still waiting on an update.
Colt Big Mac :).
Eeyup :3
But it took me like half an hour to catch filly derpy
uh...cant you only go to one town in that game?
lolwutno
Everlasting_Joy alot has changed from then...well, not core gameplay wise, but other things
WallDives: Nope
WallDives: You can go to cerulean now
I just ordered Pkmn Black and White 2 on Amazon myself.
Should get it within a week
oh, they /finally/ updated ponymon then? is it complete?
Dken2021: You'd be surprised as to how I still follow it.
WallDives: No
WallDives: But you can get one more gym badge -lol
oh. then I wont waste time on it then./
I ordered my copy on amazon literally the day before it was released
lol
Actually, I take that back, the last Pokemon game I played was "Pokemon Colloseum". That was fun.
Colloseum was pretty good.
I liek stadium better though.
XD was also good too
ehh...
I liked Stadium for it's Dodrio game boy :D.

Dodrio mode gameboy was the best
The days before the running shoes
yep.
this was the running shoes on running shoes.
lol
yeagh
yeah*
and those gamblers. evil, evil gamblers. ._.
My interest in the pok?mon games kind of died after gen 3 came out, but it got relit again when HeartGold and SoulSilver came out.

WallDives: Derpy is at about 3% appearence rate now.
Gold_Demona|DDR: Mine got back when I started browsing around the internet.
Well, you have lubs here, ofna01
WallDives: But after the next update I think they said it will be at 1%
I've been listening to Heartaches by the Number since then
Mega_Milk, I dont like playing incomplete games. and since there more-than-likely isnt a metagame to it, I'll only play for storyline. and since the game isnt complete...
ofna01: Also sorry to hear that.
WallDives: Its not like its something totally new -lol
WallDives: Its just pokemon with skins and a few text mods
I know. but I'd rather focus on something with a actual metagame.
WallDives: meh

Damn. Can't find any Rainmeter skins that I like
ASoftFluffyThing - make one?
ASoftFluffyThing: Rain meter?
MirrorImage, don't know how.
Playing defense against invaders in a video game can be so long and daunting.
Mega_Milk, those fancy clocks, docks and stuff that people have on their desktops to make it look awesomer
ASoftFluffyThing: Ah!
ASoftFluffyThing: I have one on my phone :3
Mega_Milk, how'd you get one on your phone?
ASoftFluffyThing: App store

ASoftFluffyThing: Hmmmm let me find it
ASoftFluffyThing: No idea
ASoftFluffyThing: I actually installed it with astro
ASoftFluffyThing: It was a payed for app.
ASoftFluffyThing: But I just downloaded it and installed it manually.
Mega_Milk, aaah. I don't have money for apps because unemployed :3
ASoftFluffyThing: I know the feeling.
ASoftFluffyThing: Look up astro file manager in the android market
and you can download any app you want off of 4shared.com for free.
Mega_Milk, my android is 2.4.something
ASoftFluffyThing: Its not a hack.
Mega_Milk, because it's the one from straigh talk
I dunno why, but I insist on listening to sad songs when im sad
:P
ASoftFluffyThing: So is mine ^-^
ofna01: Your just gonna bum yourself out more -lol
Mega_Milk, LG Optimus Q?
ASoftFluffyThing: Thats the one! XD
oh Wrek i am si jelly of you
Mega_Milk, holy shitballs, I have the same phone!
It actually helps, i dunno why.
ofna01: As do I. I think it's because you want to take yourself to the extreme, than you realize how low that is, so you want to go back to happy.
ASoftFluffyThing: Eeyup i figured that.
ofna01: Whatever helps you get through the days mate.
Alright, I need something adorable ASAP
Wrek: "Honey, I think we're lost."

ofna01: Diabeetus ain't so bad. You just have to watch your blood sugar, heart and weight.
I hate sharp stuff
Mega_Milk, Okay I have it downloaded. How do I go about Rainmeter again?
Before anyone asks, no, I'm not diabetic.

Anyone gonna get the MLP comic? I'm thinking about it
like a BLAWK
:D
Wirisme: I'm not, but that's because I am po.
Oh Kuledud3, <3
po?
POR QUE?!
Poor, and so broke I can't afford the "or".
Ah :)
Wirisme: already ordered :D
how is that comic? any good?
Dken2021: loosely connected to canon and made by pretty great artists
Anyone say anything in the last 3 or so minutes? got disconnected
Wirisme: No, I don't think so.
not really, just me asking about the comics
Dken2021: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/b2c59b6b0b675d0df940601356c20c74.jpg one of those being this artist :3
oh that's neat
Wirisme: already ordered the comic:D
MadSurge: Luna's got bad breath.
Everlasting_Joy: you're not the first thinking that :D
XD rarity's reaction
I love it when there are a ton of people just standing in a straight line, all for you to shoot :).
I wish they'd hurry up and make the show available over here, it's stupid that all the other stuff is (including the comic) but the show itself isn't
where do you live?
sunny england
All right, I must head out for class. I must say, it was kind of nice waking up to this.
See y'all in about 3 hours.
It used to show on boomerang (before I even found it) but they just sort of abandoned it now
They even took down the FIM page on their site it seems
huh, well it's not translation issues, I guess they had to do some legal battles I guess
Yeah it's kind of sad
Hopefully I can import the s1 box set when it comes out
yea, there;s that
And I'll definitely be here for s3 :)
Ok, I'm back. What'd I miss? 8D
nothing muc
Me bitching about the availability of fim internationally
ah
you'd think this wouldn't be a problem for today, if they known ahead in time what to do with it internationally
I'm done now though :) Just gotta hope it all works out in the end
Yeah that's very true Dken2021
I guess they never expected anything like this

So disagree on Metropolis (2001) not being an A movie

Level themes generally > credits theme
Sumica: What was the name of that video?
Lil_B: I sure hope not!
Mega_Milk: What if the moon had lyrics?
Back then, the credits themes for games were usually just mashups of all the level themes.
MadSurge I say mother 3 is that exception
or something

MOTHER 3!
Vordox: Ah
MadSurge I object, but I have no time to proofe my point xD

PeachStreak: And that's good? D:

Vordox: no school for a day
Does it matter? We beat the game! That's what matters.
PeachStreak: That's SAD! D:
Vodox: why? a day off
PeachStreak: Which is a HUGE tragedy yes
anyone else watching the space jump today?
Missing 1 day in school = Super sad D:
Everlasting_Joy but that means the game is over ;_;
Vodox: why its not tlike the end of the world?
If the endings we get are all like Mass Effect 3 then I prefer no ending
Dken2021: New game + my friend :).
PeachStreak: That's 1 day of missed knowledge
its Complete already.
i took a day off work for borderlands
im at the Heavens doors :3
completely worth it
Vordox: i got the notes for today from all teachers im good
PeachStreak: . ;_; Close enough
MadSurge: To be fair, the ending of ME3 is a LOT more tolerable after the EC was added.
Gold_Demona thats not a great achievment though
Chrysalis: i did that on a school day once :D
teh ned!
Gold_Demona: I heard that the game still ends horribly :(
Gold_Demona - the counterpoint to that is that a good game shouldn't NEED DLC to suddenly become "good"
Chrysalis: have to say i agree
chrono trigger has some great endings
the ending was god aweful
MirrorImage: yep
aint that super right ?

Seriously
Actually, this was made BEFORE Mario 3.
What's Captain N?
Gold_Demona: the GAY Master.
MadSurge: Exactly! XD
Before that game, the colors of the Bros's shirt and overalls were reversed.

If it was for a more valuable hat, I doubt I'd go for that skin.
00,10indeed it is
05from waht ive seen
Fersure, Obama's been screwing up the economy in every way he can, empowering our enemies, alienating our friends. The guy's a friggin' traitor
were the genders reversed
00,10I love the animations she has too
there would be some serious legal ramifications
Kandarihu: He has? How?
nice adams apple mario-anna
05it seems liek the president has no power, and only is but a public figure to keep the people occupied while the senate/congress whatever you call them run the country

Wrek: we talking about the US?
Kandarihu: He didn't fuck up the economy =P
Seems more like our constitutional monachy Wrek
figure head with no real power
Kandarihu: It was fucked up before he eve got in the seat.
The president has executive power.
has no choice but to sign stuff
The congress has legislative power.
oh my, my mother just bought me an iphone for no apparent reason
The supreme court has judicial power.
i'm scared
Basically, this is how the US government's set up: there are 3 branches of power: Executive, Legislative, and Judicial.
Wrek: The president has SOME say in things. He pretty much has the final say so on what passes and what doesn't.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I feel sad for you :P
actually Obama has done tons of good things.
00,10pants less link
wow this brings back memorys
Link talks? impossibru!
Vordox i'm scared there is probably bad news coming
Fersure: Like stopping the SOPA act?
Executive is the President, he has the power to pass or veto laws that are sent to him. A law can't go into effect for the Federal government until the president passes it.
http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/260193_465393553481478_1709650430_n.jpg
oh please, SOPA was dead before it even got to Obama
Well, Obama has been ruling by executive orders. The major bills that he got run through Congress pretty much centralizes a lot of the power to the Whitehouse.
Fersure: His Veto stopped it
lol, Accurate, DaringDerpy
who was the Lugie actor agian?
Wrek: I's so classic isn't it?
Vordox, Obama didn't have the chance to veto it.
Um...
Legislative is Congress. The draft laws, and vote on whether or not to send them to the president. If a bill passes congress, but the president vetoes it, Congress can still pass it if both houses (Representatives and the Senate) get a 2/3 vote to override it.
Mel Gibson

Wrek: All the bad stuff = Good stuff, but people only see the bad stuff. :P

Sigh.
/me Does the mario
/me does the mario also
I think both of them would make decent presidents.
/me Does The Mario also.
RAWRity, that's how it's supposed to work. Obamacare was passed by a 50+1 rule.
05i dont know much about the US political system, and frnakly i dont want to know. what worries me is that health care isnt considered a human right
Judicial is the supreme court. They interpret laws, and the constitution. They can declare a law or action by the government unconstitutional. The president is in charge of appointing new justices to the Supreme Court when a space opens.
Kandarihu: when it comes to social policies, Romney is like the complete opposite to me
DaringDerpy: Mario for President, Luigi for Prime minister
Kandarihu: Oh true, it was dead as soon as he got it =P
Sumica NEXT MARIO
his social policies make me sick.
Wrek: I don't wanna know how this political system works... And I LIVE here. o_o
i find it worrying that people complained when he made it law that insurance has to actually pay out
Wrek: not exactly. healthcare? yes. Paying for it? not so much.
dat hat
05guess thats where it slpits
pony hat :)
Wrek: Indeed, politics are just fillings... So meh to that. There's plenty of stuff I hate about USA, or how they run things :P
Like Forced Manslaughter...
05payed for is included in the right
05otehrwise its not a right
:D
woo woo
05then it beocmes a privelege
Dat Applebloom hat...
/me buys some apples
I want that Applebloom hat...
Vordox, but he didn't even get it. It was put on hold when the major websites went on strike, and quietly put to death later on when it became apparent that it couldn't be snuck through
health care is definitely a human right
I don't.
and Obama has worked hard to defend that belief
I'll be honest with ya, I don't really want ponies in TF2.
Fersure, it's not a natural right.
/me wants a scootaloo hat
Kandarihu: Wasn't that the whole Reddit shutdown time?
Applebloom hat XD
Im getting that hat XD
Kandarihu: well it is.
so uch want
.....
13thing is someone has to pay for it
ALL OF THEM
my little pony
Vordox, Reddit, Wikipedia, Youtube... I think Facebook to.
00,10I had to mod the hat a bit so all classes could wear it
Kandarihu: Mucho Gracia to those stances.
this just shows

I FEEL THAT THIS IS BIASED:
Do you like my sword sword!~
05high taxes arent as scary as people make them otu to be
Sword my diamond sword sword!
i can swing my sword sword
Wrek: No shit, we have one of the highest taxes in the world...
..........
sword my diamond SWORD SWORD
We're complaining, BUT we get the good things in life :P
Wrek, try telling that to the people who are actually paying them.
Well, that happened.
Rainbow licked my finger! :D
Kandarihu: ...We ARE?
05try having a 33% tax rate
damnit Gold_Demona now the songs in my head
and then flash freezed my system...
05we do know
Gold_Demona: i was supposed to put my finger there? ugh oh...
goddamit
Chrysalis: LOL, glad I could be of service. XD
05and i am glad i have that tax
inb4 laugh sfx
Wrek: same.
05casue i know the benefits that come with it
Wrek im supposed to get a payrise soon which will put my on 40%
Wrek: It's a miracle Sweden is where it is in the economy due to the tax alone atm
My Little Pony with laugh tracks...hm....
20% Cooler?
Look. Free Health Care isn't a natural right. A natural right is something that someone can do without anyone interfering. Health Care is something that is provided from the outside. Hence, it's not natural.
05Chrysalis: how much you make a month?
laugh trcks for S3
00,1025% of my check goes to taxes and othere services wrek
05as in

Next episode air time is unknown.
05enough to live of i hope
yeah
i got my own place and stuff
there's one tax I hate
and that is sales tax
and if i want it i can generally buy it
Wrek: Existens minimum.. ._.
I am completely against sales tax and sin taxes.
00,10and i live in a state with no state wage tax
What is the original song from Barrel roll?
THATS NOT A FUCKING BARREL ROLL
I don't think someone's right to buy on a free market should be discouraged.
lol He-Man
/me ends rage
I heard it somehwere, but I forgot it
Chrysalis: Ikr :P
Oh, Antology 1?

hell, the war on drugs needs to end already
Fersure: War of drugs...*Looks at Sweden* Hmmm.
fus
ro dah
Vordox: hmm?
05drugs are prominent here
05but we dont put people in jail for it
Vordox: I'm not very familiar with Sweden's stance on drugs
Wrek: Yeah but I haven't heard much of it lately...
05generally
05as in using
Fersure, I guess so. But it needs to be replaced with better education.
Aye, we don't. But I haven't heard in the news for a while about "bigger" Drug headlines.
05fines, gettign taken care of for detox etc
apparently theyre trying to crack down on people heading to amsterdam because weed is legal
which is stupid
Kandarihu: well exactly. currently in schools they try telling kids that if they smoke weed they'll die or something.
Is weed legal in Britain?
Chrysalis: here's something for you then.
Chrysalis: Legalize Drugs.
I think it is, isn't it?
its a good idea
Kandarihu: if you lie to kids about drugs, they distrist everything you say about them and just use whatever
Aww Spike!~ :)
05correction
legalise and regulate
05legalize drugs that are less lethal than tobacco
lol Spike
05then ban tobacco
Wrek: XD
Wrek but then no alcohol
ban weed also to
I don't think any recreational drugs should be banned
Wrek: around here it depends on the police/area. In areas where Drug use is big, the cops will look past it unless it's a dealer, or connected to a more serious crime. Other places where it's uncommon usually have the police crack down on it.
Wrek: That'll never happen, most money government makes is tab money
Dat Pinkie
I think they should be regulated and the companies should be taxed.
then we could lower taxes.
You gotta share
for everyone.
Lower taxes?
Really?
Plus tab isn't all that lethal, it's the tar and niccotine mainly
sure.
Why earn and then lose, Fersure?
by legalising recreational drugs, absolutely.
05ratehr keep the same tax
City governments are trying to crack down on sugar.
05and spend the extra money on improving the service
05no?
MadSurge: What's the difference between lo and il? Sorry, Rosetta Stone isn't the greatest.
what?
You need a plus on things, not cuts.
why lower taxes?
because if you lower taxes more people spend.
Fersure: Yes, why?
and if more people spend the economy grows.
Yeah but if Governemnt can't spend, why should the people?
It'll offbalance.
7their research into the actual game mechanics can't be faulted. Ghetsis' electrocution attack wasn't very effective against snivy
well government needs a ton of cuts.
drop politicians wages
or drop expenses
but they're cutting the wrong things.
so much money saved
I'm suprised we're having this discussion in a sensible way. <3
The government has a ton of useless programs.
Kandarihu: That I can agree with...
that they do
Vordox: That's because this chat is awesome. <3
05im not suprised i havent stopped hugging twilie
Wrek: STILL!?
Wrek: You'll smother her.
I'm not either, Wrek :)
/me dances
/me headbangs
donutpop365: mainly sound and letters assonance. "Il cane" sounds better than "Lo Cane" :D
give me the music

The income of the state is in direct relation to its spendings
and the rest of that song is terribad
/me has been falling constantly for 2 minutes now
frakturfreak: Eeyup
this is the only good bit of the song
cutting costs doesn’t help
05heres a thought
Just one?
Wow, RD spins alot.
05theres no such thign as profit when it comes to a goverment. theres income and expense.
7OH GOOD GOD ASH XD
MadSurge: Oh, so it really doesn't matter? Okay then, that's confusing :P and what would L' be?
7Nice hat
Wrek: Err. Norway? :P
MadSurge: And basically just asthetics then.
the problem is they try to cut the wrong things
Candy Mountain! :D
they cut education
they cut all this stupid shit
05also
instead of cutting politicians wages
05lending roofs
and the DoD
haha
7ah but ash's pikachu never goes inside it's pokeball
Applejack has best poker face
13ah politics..
05and you wouldtn be in this situation in the first place
7so close, PETA
13land of the uninformed
Bronysith: Um... not so easy, since WE PICK THE IDIOTS.
how about the US only has troops in the US?
that would save a ton of money
Not sure on what Lending Roofs are, but I can guess by the name
I like how they have attacks like "Protest" and "Educate"
Balance Economy = good stuff happens. :P That's all I know
Bronysith, I agree. Problem is, the idiots have 90% control of the mainstream media, the entertainment industry, and academia.
For PIIIIIIE!~
05basically "past this point we will not lend more money"
did i miss Wrek showing his twilight plushie D:
lol family guy disney version
Bronysith yea, too many old geezer who are kinda not with the times, heck none of them are not sure how technology can benefit people
05"but save isntead"
I think the US needs a balanced budget amendment to their constitution
Kandarihu: i blame MTV
Fersure, hear hear!
donutpop365: it does matter, because they only go with certain names. L' is for names that start with a vowel
And some of them actually do damage
Kandarihu: I also believe bills should only be allowed to be x pages long
and must be in plain English
/me does the Mambo
Shoo be doo
Nooo!
S:
SUMI!
shoo be doo!
/me calls upon the sea ponies
Bronysith, but is MTV even popular any more?
so is there still a stream
that's like the only reason I'm against obama care
Kandarihu: jersey shore
Fersure: THESE DAMN BILLS ARE TOO LONG
I think most of the problem in this country is that Congress doesn't have finite terms like the President does. We should be allowed to boot their asses out of their congressional seats after a set number of years.
I don't believe one bill should be able to spend so much
Bronysith, point taken
Oh, okay then, thanks a ton!
13 would be nice if the politicians actually read the bills they pass
Vordox: THE RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH
Fersure: Ah thank you XD I forgot the famous quote
05i find comfort that one of swedens politicians in EU at brussels is a prominent member of the pirate party

Dark92Enigma: Well darn it, I missed it.
And Scootaloo doesn't get any blanket. Doesn't she ever catch a break?
But I'm not tired

I haven't heard of that cchange yet
05welcome to scandinavia
05specifically finland
13Kandarihu: inb4 it's spent debunking the "OH NOES BIG BIRD" bs that popped up this week
Oh, I thought you meant global :P
05pfft
05if human rigths were global
I was slightly impressed that someone had apparently bothered to do their research, though
Shizuka: hahaha XD
I'm for creating a new political party. Imma call it the BIRTHDAY PARTY! Cake and presents for everypony!~
05us would have proper healthcare
If only Wrek....
Not just US :P
Shizuka: The drive by thing? -lol
Here's a Nostalgic song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if_0SNR-7SE
13but wrek, people come from all over the world to here exactly *for* our healthcare
I generally consider the act of sharing and accepting that which has been shared is a natural right.
AJIsAwesome: and NC's review made me love the show even MORE
or at least play one of the games for more than five seconds
Wrek: Pffftt health care? If you break an arm in the US you lost an arm.
Dark92Enigma: LAWL love the pic with the ponies
13penn has it right, there's great joy in helping others, but no joy in doing it under penalty of law
Shizuka: And how's that going?
05point is
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84PZbL_-jjU
Mega_Milk, the best health care in the world is still not Miracles of God.
dat Sumica quit
Kandarihu: When I think health care. I think. Bandage.
05goverment should provide proper healthcare for its citizens. covered in expense with no profit by taxes. and if the wealthier bunch wish to buy via private companies then go right on ahead.
05that is my view of said matter
13Mega_Milk: if you break an arm in the us you go to a hospital and they brace it
Kandarihu: Not miracle of god -lol
13hospitals are not allowed to refuse care
Wrek: A socionorm balance of Left/Right wing?
7they at least looked up Ghetsis
13but care costs money, someone has to pay for it
Shizuka: Yeeeeaaaahhhhh come to my "Neck of the woods"
eewwww carbon tax
13considering social security and medicare are so horrendously broken that they're something like 70% of our deficit alone...
Gotta go, bye!
Ciao, everypony.
bye
05Shizuka not saying its being done right
Bye, donutpop365. :)
13it's what happens when you tell someone "you don't need to work for yourself, someone else will do it for you"
05im sayign how its suppsoed to work
donutpop365: Later.
Wrek: An alternative way of making it work, Wrek. :P
05ill be goign live soon
There's bad sides with our system as well
05Vordox: im not sayign it isnt
Only government system that isn't fucked up is Salamias
the system is broke yo.
Wrek, alright. I'm gonna exempt your plushie from my pony fast.
Wrek: I know, but the way you said it, may have cuased some confusion making it sound like we are doing it right(It works for us though so far)
Wrek: planetside 2 time?
I dunno, I don't mind my current government. I mean, they lie through their teeth, but it seems people have figured that out by now.
I say, we live like in Equestria
Everyone doing what they want
WE WIN
Yeah, that'll work fine.
Wrek: Mind I show you a video before you go stream?
show me a politician who doesn't lie and I show you a truly talented liar
05sure

Because I'm hungry, and we have no soup

05quick question
Haven't heard anything bad from him... so yea I guess
13eh depends on the pie
And it hurts more than getting a white hot ballistic knife in my foot
05are ther any goverment funded or goverment owned uhm.. organizatiosn or companies etc. that are goign with profit in the US?
So really. He doesn't want Big Bird to die. He wants Big Bird to fly

05if yes: then there's a problem

Isn't that a common issue around the world atm, Wrek?
Uh........ my ISP.

Oh, Government FUNDED; nvm
13gov owned? every last one is paying out more than they take in
Well, it's kinda run by the municipal government of Chattanooga TN
Makes me wonder

He signed a very large parchment
...I ran out of words.
Kammerjunk: Does a person that has the face of the land, really need power?
I have an interview tomorrow, if I get the job, I will flood the world with MUFFINS.
Ewww politics
Giving some political power to the parliment
I don't know how, really, but I'll do it!
Randomnerd: Good luck!
Thanks, Vordox
Vordox: Oh, nobody actually likes them, they just act like brats.
Randomnerd Job at the Local Bakery?
Kammerjunk: Hehe. :P Like Prince...Harry was it?
If you was a Brit, Lil_B. You'd be smacked for not knowing that :P
Lil_B: lol
Randomnerd: Best of luck. Also, make sure tgey're different flavored muffins every now and then. :)
Vordox: Who, the Danish prince?
Kammerjunk: Someone named Prince Harry cause ruckus alot
13here we go
Vordox: "Someone"
Oh, royals.
Prince Harry rocks, mate.
13in other news http://fav.me/d5hdxl0
Like our famous Victoria who drove around iN Stockholms walking streets, remember that Wrek? :D
Possibly England. I dunno, our prince is called Henrik, and he's a downright douche.
05all i remember is the nudes
Oh...
Errr
I missed that on purpose. :P Private life is private life
Everyone hates Harry because he fucked a woman and was caught on camera, which shouldn't have even been there
Not sure what to vote for on A Movie
05it was practically thrown in my face
05litterally
Well, here in the states, we get to pick our rulers and they still suck :P
13oh wrek
13i think you need to give twi your glasses
13http://fav.me/d52xevf
Randomnerd: Vote Ron Paul, DO A change for god sake :P
Better have a Risk then fall
And considering we have "political dynasties", we might as well have royals.
Vordox: I'm voting third party, don't worry about that.
Change?! Ya got change?!
Serenity well, I know enough to know that most english Kings and Qeenes from mid 18th to WW1 came from Hannover :P
Of course...
SAYING "We can CHANGE" is not "a change" when there IS no "change" Obama.
Besides, I live in NY state, so the state is going to Obama anyway.
IMO, I beleive that the motto for every government party in the world should be "LETS FUCK UP DA PLANET"
Randomnerd, voting 3rd party is pretty much tantamount to not voting at all
Serenity: Hehe
There aren't enough pissed-off democrats in the state to turn away from Obama.
It's a shame ROn Paul won't go into the next election
Kandarihu: It depends. Not voting at all is the only mistake you can make.
Cause that guy had the sense of a governemnt President for over 30 years
But was presse down by... well everything
eeyup. In the history of the US there has been a grand total of ONCE that a third party has effected the election in any significant way. And that 3rd party had to be lead by Teddy Roosevelt.
Our system's math forces a two party system.
He foretold stuff that happened within 10-30 years...
And STILL noone listened, GEEZ.
13paul's biggest problem is his foreign policy (sticking your fingers in your ears and going LALALALA doesn't make things go away) and his followers
13of all the fandoms on the internet, ron paul fans are the most rabid i've seen
Shizuka: I know, but why is that bad?
A third party only gains power if one of the two parties is dying.
Randomnerd, or voting without getting all the facts together. Did you know that there are people in some states who have ALREADY voted without even watching the debates?
Oh I forgot you were around DWR.
Nope.
Vordox: Well, nobody listened wen Morgan Robertson foretold the whole Titanic thing.
Not here.

dwr pls
Shizuka: yeah, Paul became the Candidate for slightly jaded college kids who wanted to seem progressive.
Kandarihu: Some people have to, like Service Personnel.
Kammerjunk: Touché to that as well
I will be gone for a while though Joomay
aww
Gonna go for a night walk
:3
Randomnerd, good point.
13the problem with the voting process around here is it guarantees a two party system
Night?
DashWithRainbows: Be careful.
No.
Shizuka: Pretty much.
What bloody time is it?
Shizuka: This.
13voting third party just takes a vote away from whichever of the big two is closest to you
Shizuka: If you don't like it, change it, We change all the stuff here in Sweden for most of the time when it's defective. :P
13which makes the other guy win

very nice design.
;___; now im hungry
13can't remove the battery
Thats true, and no sd card slot
Seriously, HTC phones have got battery lives like bloody HP laptops
13depending on how fast it drains i don't think it'll be a problem
Serenity Probably due to the hardware in it.
my dad uses his for business and it lasts the day
it lasts longer than my iphone 5 battery
13i figure i'll have it charge on asuka every night anyways
First gen iphone that has been used enough can have a battery that lasts for longer then a day
Only upside
Also, any party that gets 5% of the popular vote in the US gains a lot of advantages.
the only problem is that you have to use a first gen iphone :P
and no one cares about those anymore :P

Brad[Laptop] In how reliable it is and how long it can be used without charging is god damn good. But yeah it's mostly beaten in terms of a whole key of things
even though they do the same thing you did for your newer iphones: talk on phone and browse facebook
Vordox, ... I guess I was wrong about Ron Paul on Israel.
How are you going to draw art Wrek with only one hand
Wrek: like a boss
Kandarihu: Stop govern the world <-- One of his messages.
We czurrently have the Problem in germany that nobody votes anymore, we recetnly had electiuons for our Region and less than 50% of the poeple actually voted
Kandarihu: Anyway, it's too late, too much slander caused Ron Paul to lose his way on the economy
Kandarihu: Where USA is headed now is... Well where's it going. :(
Lil_B: We're in a bad spot here, too.
Wrek WTF was that?
Lil_B oh dear, sounds like a big problem
In china, you vote for the communist party.
:O ART
People feel rather helpless, presumably.
Double Glasses?
Vordox, but the Federal Reserve is getting investigated now, though. So he kinda IS getting some headway.
Kandarihu: Oh shit...
:D DAT PLUSHIE
wow, that plushie looks great
Kandarihu: Inb4 Shit hits the fan....
great detail to it
mew?
Vordox, I sure hope it does.
DEAL with TWILIGHT
YEAAAAH
It's especially frustrating for me because I'm a supporter of the ACLU. No man can control the economy, but one man SHOULD NOT have the power of life and death over the citizenry.
and the us dollar is basically worthless.
hi all
Dken2021 yeah, because when all the normal people vote anymore, only the radical people (the very left or very right parties) become percentagye wise more votes and these are really not the type you want to have as your government
hey Queen_Chrysalis
Hi, Queen_Chrysalis
Wrek: need inspiration?
Wrek that looks so awesome :D
Wrek: fallout pony?
So...
Vordox My view on politics really goes. The one who can shout the loudest and give the ''best'' solution without any thinking of the long term issues and all is those who get in charge of things
Brad[Laptop], it will be worthless if the current Quantitative Easing isn't stopped soon.
Something POny related....
how are things Queen_Chrysalis
killerpony7733: Risk all and lose all? ;)
i get pinged?
Draw something... good :) well.. I guess thats the usuall state anyway xD
im ok alex
Vordox Too damn scary but very true.
killerpony7733: Exactly, how could someone not feel helpless under such conditions?
oh, nvm
ohai Chrysalis and killerpony7733
killerpony7733: Hey, a change > No change :P
Wrek: What about ... Make THE Swedish Pony. :D
Lil_B dang, that explains alot then
Vordox Problem is how our overall political systems work today.
Look at Wrek sitting there with his plush
-pokes the twilight plusheh-

Panda|Drawing Planetside 2

Dafuq? Scars?
eeeyup

yey~ finished hand sewing the legs in
Nice.
So do you have any amazing scar stories?
Not really
i do
sonicdude558|HW: Wat? Well, the only scar I have is the one I got when my brother closed a stroller on my hand.
So you need to get a scar tonight.
this one time i was building my first computer
What did you cut it on?
and i was poping out the metal plates to put in a cd drive
this was bac whe nthey made nice computer boxes
"i needed to write a story about a scar, but i didnt have a scar, so i got one. The End."
so i pushe and it went BANG and it came out
lol I did mine on some kid kicking me because I was staring at his iPod Touch
Should I start my homework or do more interwebz?
hm
hw
7:38
i was going to pop out another one so i left my hand inside the box
so my hand starts to feal warm
Kawaii_icybeauti: do homework while theres no stream, its your only hope
Kawaii_icybeauti: Homework.
HW
I dunno, I actually came up here orginally to do an assingment that I did. But if I go downstairs, my mum will see me and make me leave computer.
Alarm again.
When I was 4 I somersaulted onto a rock. With my face. Scar's gone now. :P
Wait, I'll sneak downstairs BRB
i wonder what is going on so i pull out my hand and there is blood coating my arm hlaf way down my forarm
Have some music. :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ElwJZhZx6I&feature=relmfu
taoumi: Ouch.
i go into the living room and my mom goes...."eeeyup you severd an artery alright"
so we clean it up and i get bandaged. and so now every time i build a computer i give it a little blood sacrifice
How much did it hurt?
.................yaaaaaaaaaaaaay
actualy it didn't hurt at all whe nit happend
cleanign it up hurt more then geting it
That's interesting.
i jsut though i had bumbped my hand on the top of the box
okay...Should I start with a journal entry on what life was like in ancient egypt or do meth?
lol
you severed an artery by bumping your hand on a box?
eeeyup
that doesnt seem legit..
I'll do ancient egypt.
Kawaii_icybeauti: First choice.
... You are talking about your http://i50.tinypic.com/15i6qog.jpg stories right? lol
AJIsAwesome|Reading: I was going to do that. I hate math.
how is cuting you hand o nthe sarp metal on the inside of an older computer box not legit?
when you are pushing hard to pop out a metal plate?
i think you might be mistaken on severing the artery part
Kawaii_icybeauti: You typed "meth". ;d
*:D
Secret computer box ninjas. With swords.
no i'm very sure it was an artery
it was under presure and spurting
AJIsAwesome|Reading: I spell it like that because it's like that; It's harmful in huge doeses.
and the rate that it bleed is also a dead ringer for artery
Ok. :d
taoumi: and you didnt even have to go to the doctor?
my mom is a doctor so wer just kinda patched it up
she asked if i wanted to go in to get sticked but i said nah
stiches*
lol wow
Your mom is a doctor

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJJ-QkZ8cM LISTEN TO IT
dat instrumental music
Dude, pokemon could get creepy as fuck
especially the pokemon tower
its from the offical game
Like, remember that girl that's just crying in the middle of nowhere with that Hypno?
Meh. Never found Lavender Town scary.
And then you read Hypno's pokedex entry
O_O
sonicandmario85: well duh. youve never played it, have you
Petrified_Discord: Yeah. That was interesting. :D
himself:ye si have
POP POP
pbpbppbpbppbb
I remember being creeped out a bit the first time I got to lavender Town - you're going along with the challenge, cheery music most of the time - then that music :) what a mood switch that was
the songs even on fire red
Yeah, it was. :D
I hate having to ghost.
^
having to ghost? wtf?
Canadian_Brony is "taken"
I also have never liked ghosting.
theres a ghost feature?
no
It basically means when you can't choose your original nick for a while.
does lavender town have that scary music that gave somee ppl brain seizures?
I seriously don't think Pokemon has explored the ramification where ghosts are a real an accepted fact.
Ah yes, the dead Marowak.
yea in black and white they removed the music and put happier music in lavender town
Took me forever to realize that you needed to get the Super Scope.
lavender town is in black and white?
^
sonicandmario85: Shh. I haven't played Black 2/ White 2 yet.
uh...lavender town is in kanto....
^
^^
Like, remember back when there were only 3 ghost pokemon? It's heavily implied that when pokemon die THEY BECOME THEM. What about humans? Do THEY become ghosts? Do they become POKEMON? What's even the point of ghost stories where GHOSTS ARE REAL. And you can CATCH THEM. And they have SPECIAL ATTACKS. ...And they smile.
AJIsAwesome|Reading:i meant the first one...
Do you mean, HG/SS?
unless you mean gold and silver, then yes
that top comment "Fun Fact: The music isn't instrumental.It's actually the hundreds of cries of numerous Pokemons' ghosts.So you're actually surrounded by hundreds of ghosts whilst﻿ visiting Lavender Town."
Petrified_Discord: That's a very interesting theory.
Cypresswolf: .........
sonicandmario85: so youre saying lavender is in black and white 1?
yes i think so atleast
http://derpy.me/xB0dp
i dont think it is
Well it is on the gameboy so it IS in black and white :P
i saw a lets play showing it
Dken2021: hory sheet
IMMMMMMM DOOOOONNNNEEEEEE!!!!;)
you know the black and white thats 3D?
Kawaii_icybeauti: Yay! :3
XD: Gale of darkness?
original Red & Blue didnt have color - color started showing in yellow I think
^
Pokemon Yellow: now in A color
:D
actually, they had color if you put them in a super gameboy
:D
blue was all blueish brown
Soopa doopa gameboy
and red was al lredish brown
ruby/sapphire was so awesome. i still remember how groudon/kyogre took over the world
Pokemon: Reddish-brown didn't sell as well, though
Dude when I first got pokemon ruby and the motherfucking cartridge was see-through red I nearly flipped my shit
Wow, the buffer show is still going? Thats odd
oh i think the happier lavender town music wasnt in black and white it was in another ed pokemon game...well one that has 3d graphics
himself: I had the most awesome ruby, but I lost it :(
btw I finished my hw
Valve Playtester Survey coool
3d*
I got conned out of Sapphire as a kid. :|
AJIsAwesome|Reading: You mean someone took it?
No.
yo himself are you still there?
Kawaii_icybeauti: yeh that sucks
nothing streaming?
good
sonicandmario85: that is possible
Someone traded me Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories for it. :|
that sucks AJIsAwesome|Reading
AJIsAwesome|Reading: Boooooooooo
I had several pokemon from my original ruby & sapphire game on my crystal version - but that game no longer works - doesnt keep a saved game anymore
I mean it's no ruby or emerald, but still. Fukken chain or memories?
salamence is best pokemon
himself: I think you mean gengar
yo Cypresswolf get a 3.5 gamebit, rip it open and solder a new battery
Petrified_Discord: I know. *sigh*
not Ruby/Sapphire...gold & silver .... ah I dont remember which gen crystal was part of - too many pokemon games now
salamence>gengar. salamence is an uber after all
i forget if they banned ubers from multiplayer though

See, I still have my Gengar from Ruby. The reason I still have it is because I noticed that this particular Gengar would kill everything and never die. It was only until Diamond/Pearl that I found out what IV's were and lo and behold, motherfucker's got perfect IV's.

What's different with Black & White 2 from the 1st set?
Just making sure you are still on :3
Cypresswolf: Time lapse, I think.

Also, it continues from Black/White.
Cypresswolf 649 to be exact
/me approaches AJIsAwesome|Reading from behind sneakily
DoctoDoctorWho: !
http://www.valvesoftware.com/gamersurvey.php?action=survey << requires us zip code D:
I'm betting the franchise will reach 1000 pokemon before running out of ideas
hi DoctoDoctorWho
/me upon hearing a certian MGS sound effect, the doctor flee's
also: inb4 valves 'hardware' is linux based pc
where does say that ?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, it doesnt, i entered my postcode and it complained
australia has 4 digit post codes
I wish you would get an ACTUAL award instead of a "diploma".
AJIsAwesome|Reading: But anyway, hi buddy:)
Cypresswolf they've been running out of ideas since the first gen? Seel? Voltorb?
Hi, DoctoDoctorWho. :)
hi DoctoDoctorWho
ohh i entered mine but it's 5 digits
And people say that Gen 5 was unoriginal.
Pokemon creation: take an animal. take an object. Combine them.
too bad if it only us based
Pokemon Fushion
Squirt gun. Turtle. Squirtle.
Seriously though, I hate the war between Gen 5 and Gen 1. Makes me sick.
also, hello thelonepony Lunar_Brony and anypony else I missed:$
Zebra. Umbrella. Zebrella.
There's your gen 6 there.
AJIsAwesome|Reading: G3 is best gen
Petrified_Discord XD
DoctoDoctorWho: ^
those "legendary" pokemon - how much more powerful can they get - once you reach gods & creation status, there's little if anything above that
For pokemon, not ponies. Definitly not ponies, 0_0
Cypresswolf: I was wondering that.
2,14 stream working for everyone?
ValtheJean is now
ValtheJean: there was stream?
My favorite moment in pokemon is when you reach the gen 3 elite four and you get a different intro and the special, kinda scary music. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC6TnjsmTjw

DoctoDoctorWho: why?

2,14 let us all take a moment to honor Nobuo Uematsu, as this was his last official work on a final fantasy game
all those hours of game play WASTED :'(
2,14 his music is a significant reason why these games are amazing
sadmusic.avi
Dovah: f***ing hate ff, Im sorry I just do...
but yeah, uematsu was boss
/me salutes to one of his favorite musicians of all time
*composer
DoctoDoctorWho: Don't you dare say the music is bad!!!!! :[
whatevs
so ValtheJean is this just the regular version of FFX or the international version?
ValtheJean, FFX? god dammit! You are further making me wanna draw Lulu D:
dat animation
2,14 probably the regular version, it's my roommate's copy since the one I own is scratched and crashes every time at the dance =/
Kinda an upbeat mix of Prelude
ive only played one ff, but that half-squat arm stretch animation was the same
Dovah: well my sound isnt working and I've never played the game so Ill just have to take your word for it.
2,14 hmmm....a name
Tidus?

DoctoDoctorWho: k... i'll be watching tho... :|

also, prelude <3
i really like how well they tied in auron in for kingdom harts 2
I have a 2.1 speaker system, and there's a plastic bag in front of my woofer. So I hear that bag every time there's bass
inb4 shit gets real
^
oh look, it's daddy
the aids?
how do they hold their breath for so long?
There goes the bag again
taoumi: special water
Final Boss Music
i call shinanigans
It's kind of a surprise hearing Nobuo Uemetsu doing metal
2,14 there's been debate whether or not they hold their breath, or can actually breath underwater
taoumi: its actually possible, the water has enough oxygen that you can breathe it
2,14 but honestly, it's a game, who gives a fuck
ValtheJean: i like the idea of an intense amount of oxygen in the water
yeah except water shreads the ravioli in your lungs Brad[Laptop]
Bronysith: yeah, but it's too little to process it out of the water
thats not ominous
opps sorry Brad[Laptop]
Bronysith: that's why they invented breathing fluid
Auron gives no fucks
whaty game is this? o 3o
i dont know who did it, but they mangaed to create a fluid that is actually breathable. tested it on rats, it worked
ff10
FF X
Oh snap
ff10 in b4 it got poopy in ff13
taoumi lol
Who performed that metal btw?
Dark_Horst: as cool as it sounds, the usefulness of this product would be?
hallo bah- opps spoilers
My plastic bag is going crazy
Mfw I turn on the stream and suddenly MEG RYAN
2,14 I'm watching you Taoumi -_-
taoumi: :|
:3
DoctoDoctorWho: deep water diving.
:D
AURON
Best pony, rite thar
doctor_whooves127: diving. breathing a fluid instead of a gas would come in handy at high pressure depths
taoumi: you Did spoil that for me.
It would help people survive the pressure.
Ralin: like, making more use of space in a compressed tank?
omg a giant bal lof water
Dark_Horst, the stuff seen in The Abyss?
??
naw, that was gas
it'
s zubat
I'll HAAAAAAARM YOU
DoctoDoctorWho: No, it would support your lungs, so you wouldn't be crushed.
our hero ladies and gentlemen
But that WAS liquid.
Hi!
i might have to rewatch that movie
hi
Ralin: thats your lungs covered, what about the rest of your body?
oh wait, i was thinking of sphere
never saw the abyss
How are you?
a skull can easily collapse in 1000+ feet of water
I thought his name was Titus or something....aw well...
I'm good, you?
2,14 I changed it to Dari
It was a pink liquid, tested on someone's pet mouse, actually used on the protagonist for the dive at the end
Tidus.
Also known as Meg Ryan.
Dari is fitting because....well... dari
I'm good. Had fun chatting with a friend earlier. XD
I don't know the specifics, but it would supposedly help.
oh that's good
an anenomi
Ralin: I suppose
Ah yes. This music is truely the Uematsu touch
inb4 dari makes an appearance
No kill like overkill.
/me is getting C&C 3 in a few weeks
/me is excited beyond words
neat DoctoDoctorWho
it's a fun game DoctoDoctorWho. play as gdi first, the nod campain is harsh
taoumi: does scrin have a campaign?
huh that look like gravity
So basically they're fighting Cthulhu's minions
yeas DoctoDoctorWho but you have to finish bolth the gdi and nod campains to get to it
http://soundcloud.com/sadhudubstep/gangnam-style-sadhu-remix
it is, gravity is called demi sometimes
taoumi: I will fight to hell and back for that, f***ing love the scrin.
ded chat?
Nope.
GDI is good to tho,
the nod campain is a pain though :/
somewhat
hai lyra
Hi guys I am back :) what did I miss?
ff10 intro
Nothing much.
Reminds me of KH1
It always seems that the tech savvy side in a campaign is always harder. Less firepower to bring to the front I suppose.
btw I never played KH1
well for nod their units are jsut so much less durable
ZERG WRATH!
Really rocking my plastic bag
TF2 Updated
New MVM junk
plastic bag Kandarihu ?
ValtheJean: Has it ever been tested that you can kill all the enemies without hitting the object?
Quantity has a quality all its own
ooo noooo waters
this music has so much nostalgia
Or do you need to do it?
2,14 they respawn infinitely
The bag in front of my 2.1 system's woofer
AH.
Okay.
it's ... a glowinghole
I always thought that young guy looked like Nick or.. Aaron Carter, that backstreets boys dude's brother
THIS IS YOUR STORY
Granted, I haven't seen a picture of either for over 10 years
spageti
/me guesstimates
I am acting!
:D
Aaron Carter, were have I heard that name b4?
Listen
oh hi Lyra
swimming...in the air
Some pop singer in the 90s i think.
/me defenestrates Valthejean
I am still acting
You think>
*?
DoctoDoctorWho, had some hit in 2001, kid artist
k
2,14 was there a reasoning behind that LC?
Dis monologue
Who is streaming
Val is
/me burps
Anyway, any JS wiz's here? I'm stuck again
Javascript that is
tha fuq?
nvm
0,5Huh?
al bhed
0,5No, just goofing around.
0,5:3
Dari can't read, not a big surprise
xD
And Lyra sits on the rock.
And then gets eaten by a shark. The end.
2,14 hmmm...dare I?
o so ps2 eh?
2,14 nah, it's more fun when you can't understand them
pretty good graphics for a ps2
I remember when AGTP released their translation patch for Tactics Ogre. It came out on April 1st and was also in Al Bhed. The English patch came out a week later.
And the chat slows down...
SEA PONIES
we're watching the riviting falling
and swiming
he seems to like falling alot
What exactly is that? (Didn't click)
and swiming
Is the music a mod or in the actual game?
random battle!
actual game
wow
sonicdude558, how could the music be modded?
it's been done
knew it
:)
OH GOD IT'S A DEEP ONE
random boss!
but no ff is ualy very good w/ it's music
Roll 1d100 for sanity loss!
Rule idk: If there is a game, there is a mod of it. No Exceptions.
again ff13 continues to disapoint
Underwater combat~
dat midi
(and 90% of the chat just went "wat")
taoumi, this is FFX
this game is 11 years old this year
i knoe i'm sayign that ff13 continues to disapoint
taoumi, ah, I see.
taoumi: final fantasy 13 will never end
Whoa! Thats a big one! - Sonic
1st one sucked
2nd one
Bronysith, not unless you finish it
i have played al lthe ff for 7 onward exp 11 and 14
a gangnam style dubstep remix :p
and 13 was afull jsutr afull
Oh hi Bronysith, why aren't u dead?
taoumi: i enjoy Final fantasy 6 and 7 the most, and 10 is just pure nostalgia
A shame he didn't
sonicdude558: nope
was XIII really that bad?
10-2 was not as bad as it was rated
The only Final Fantasy I ever beat was 6, although I have Crystal Chronicles
Dken2021: yes
YES Dken2021
/me throws Bronysith into a moon cannon, lights it and runs away
/me crawls up into sonicdude558 s plothole
sonicdude558: do you like bananas?
then cast fire tidus... srsly

Sometimes the stories in FF games look fun, but the gameplay doesn't call out to me-
I don't think Tidus is a black mage
to me 7 and 6 are the most enjoyable, but 10 has the best story to me
ff is a good game to kind of vegout to
thats probably from nostalgia though
eww I hate bananas
i love bananas
/me runs as fast as the speed of sound
/me puts a banana in sonicdude558 s throat
vegout?
sonicdude558: well thats good, cuz you and findin any, ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
mindlessly play
like not heavyily invest in
ah
*aint
it's no cod is what i mean
Dubstep isn't really my thing... Neither is Gangnam Style.
not very stressfull
god himself, you have the best username
True
Like what you see?
sonicdude558: god himself?
except 13 fk 13
2,14 mfw children say FF is a game to vegout to...*sigh*...no one remembers the classics
yeah haha, I just though it was kinda funny
oh yea, I rmember God
taoumi: you play final fantasy 6 yet?
What turned me away from games like that was my tendency to prefer Baldurs Gate / fallout and such rpg games when I was a kid
dari is hungry
no i haven't only 7 onward
wow I am going to get alot of pings
No you're not. :P
say game
No.
yes
taoumi: when you get the chance, play final fantasy 6, it is fantastic
:trollface:
NOPE.AVI
you cried.
dari cried lul
i'v been folowing a lets play so i get the story
2,14 it saddens me when people dont remember how FF used to be challenging
Titus doesnt need food
titus
V is also a good one, also the one that is the less serious out of all of them
It was challenging, as far as I remember, but I didn't like the combat system
i played 7 and 8
ValtheJean: most challenging FF in your opinnion
taoumi: im in the middle of 8 right now
the mai nsotry was not the worst but those optional bosses
ok, funs over
dem optional bosses
I was just kidding
All games used to be challenging, Val
Final Fantasy wasnamed because Square believed the game would be their last before closing down
One of these days, I'd like to do the FF6 mod called "Final Fantasy 6 is the Best Game Ever" which rebalances everything to make every battle hard.
Before the dark times. Before the Empire
Before Enix?
Cranberry_Scotch: everyone and their mothers know this story, except for new gamers hehe
DAMN YOU SQUARE ENIX
2,14 FF6 WAS hard when you didn't know how to abuse every boss fight
himself is best username
I don't know that story because I barely follow company history
:D you're suposed ot suplex the train
Rikus bondage
TARA STRONG LADIES AND GENTLEMENT
have we past the key-mon part yet?
Tara?
:)
Oh look, fanservice girl
sonicdude558: rikku is voiced by tara
SHES MINE ALL MINE :[
You're supposed to use a Phoenix Down on Wrexsoul
rikku is
Did you know that Super Smash Brothers for the N64 had a very small budget?
the first one on the NES was hard because it wasn't playtested right and filled with bugs
i prefer the 10-2 costume :3
leather crotch strap = armor
sonicdude558: eh ill switch back soon, but yeah, ive used this nickname since i played counter strike, so everyobody in kill log killed themself
Cranberry_Scotch: It did?
I never tried Suplexing the Phantom Train. Is that instakill?
How?
Yes
no i't jsut funny
lmao himself
Kandarihu nah, jsut takes damage
plot shot
but it's really funny
Fine. So the hillarity just makes it more amusing.
I don't know the exact reason, though.
she's underage fro chriast sake!
Okay.
Kandarihu, the fact that sabin can suplex a train in the first place :)
Hello Spy
Ryunosuke, I see
from TF2
oh and the kamehameha isn't silly enough
Owch
gota get that new game + to understand what the hell they are saying
jeeze that Dari is such a whiner :)
Reused audio
I understand him, idiot.
Tara Strong Ladies and gentlemen
eeyup
<3
brother :3
she'S EVERYWHERE
I've been thinking of dyeing my hair a lighter color... XD
/me 's body turns into air.
even in your games
Tara is good
she voices everything... including you
:o
x.(\ tutorial time
oh u Spectrum_Rush
silly tutotrials.. who reads that crap anyway
Also I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to hate on Rikku because Tara and all, but....I *hate* Rikku. ._.
Hehe
Her VA shouldn't change how you feel about a character
^
Your waifu is 15.
Pedo.
Val, she's underaged
:D
sphear grid... way better then the 13 crystal... spirel whatever
/me thought she was 14
2,14 I was underage when the game came out
2,14 so fuck off
same
O-o
rikku is pretty annoying...
Val Rage?
Tara is 14? My god
Aw I'm just teasing. :p
Rinoa is best ff girl
This afternoon I was looking up techniques to achieve that without bleaching.
j/k
Well, she played a 14 year old girl
oh cool
RoboGerbil, thats a wierd way to spell Lulu
My hate for Tidus is at least equal to Rikku, anyways.
The only char I remember is Rikku, because ps2 bought some ff game cause everyone said it was great
RoboGerbil: FALSE, Terra is best FF girl
RoboGerbil that's a funny way of spelling Rydia
don't remember anything from F8..or wahtever I borrowed
Hi Twilight Sparkle :)
i thought cloud was the best ff girl
:3
taoumi: heyo..
This game has a distinct lack of Auron. Needs moar.
:D
Uh, that chest plate on Rikku looks suspiciously similarly colored to skin.
Intentional.
Rinoa = Twilight Sparkle
Intentional as hell
Rikku's primary purpose is underaged fanservice.
No, really.
:S
I think so
brb one sec
random battle!
Though her design says 18+ she is underage-
CriticKitten, and I have no issues with that.
I seem to recall the original manual for the game showing her concept art as topless, which sorta gives away her purpose.
Well, I think dressing in a way to appear nearly topless is going a bit too far with fanservice.
If nudity doesn't add to the game, I'm usually oppose of it, of either gender
but--whatever, you know?
Kandarihu: Dude, you have no idea.
Wait until you see her default outfit.
just beat on the terminal till it opens
Or, heck, her FFX-2 one
oh that..yellow ribbon thing?
banging on a keyboard, a genius he is
That one's even worse. XD
Wait, she has another costume? :S
Tomorrow is the 2 Year aniversary of BRONIES
Yep.
eeeyup
CriticKitten, I just think that fanservice is okay in moderation, but I'd prefer to see it taken in a completely different extreme than the way it's always done.
of the s1 premiere?
Oh, my.
Vivix: Yep.
http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&size=l&tid=10772382 <---- That one.
Nice
Apparently, applying a 50/50 blend of lemon juice and water to hair and spending some time out in the sun can gradually lighten dark hair if done regularly.
/me clears mind
So what game is this guise?
FFX.
CriticKitten: :S
eah that one was in teh game I had
Probably one of the best of the new generation.
in that game.. dunno which, I didn't get the story or point- so never got far
That would be a pain in the ass
But mostly because of its mechanics.
And there's no room for bare breasts in my vision of extreme fanservice.
Really? I didn't like it much-
Story is pretty lackluster and some of the characters are just awful.
aah hehe
hmm i bet i could get a ps2 emulator and play my ps2 games on my pc
Buuuuuut I adore the combat and the sphere grid is pretty nice
It was the first FF game I played, after that I borrowed either FF7 or 8
Would be a better than the more damaging, quicker technique of bleaching in my opinion.
Dat percussive maintenance
/me was not a console kid
RoboGerbil how strong is your PC?
So I'm usually pretty gentle on this game. Usually when I mock it, it's just for funsies.
Dken2021: itspretty good
yeah true
TENTACOOL!
Quick, capture it!
To be honest, I grew up on consoles. I was 17 when I got my first PC
Tentacool x Misty
Why did it have a grenade in the first place? :D
I used my first computer when I was 3
Or maybe I was 16. I'm not sure
what was hawk girls story again?
eww, tentacools, the zubat of the sea
her backstory?
We always had computers
Wait. Underaged girl? Tentacle monster? OH JAPAN.
<,<
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349780099451.jpg
CriticKitten, combat tentacles
CriticKitten: misty is 18
I got my firs consol when I was..16 I think
Bronysith: :S
or well..no that's not right
hawk girl <3
I WUB HAWK GIRL!
Bronysith: Rikku isn't. She's fighting a tentacle monster. :P
She is my lesbian waifu <3
tentacle monster on a 14 yo? wait what?
z0mg, strategery!
Quick, throw a grenade at it!
You know the real irony? The only reason I was even ALLOWED to have an NES is because of Wisdom Tree, whom Nintendo didn't like.
RoboGerbil, did you read my mind? but misplace the word lyra with 14 yo?
....yes, underwater! What could go wrong?
seems that my dog is terrified of my sonic screwdriver :D
:D
Yay~
11,01Underwear?
Kandarihu oh that must've sucked having that
/me puts Nittany_Discord in a satin maid corset
Lyra`: im thinking lyra would be the one wining
suddenly Nittany_Discord
11,01Dammit.
and youre damn right RoboGerbil.
damn right.
final fantasy 10?
...
Dken2021, I didn't mind it that much. Sure the game was repetitive and AMAZINGLY buggy. But I still played it.
Well buh bye i dont liek final fantasy after they screwed up 13
bye, derpy_face.

I also got every game Wisdom Tree ever made for the NES. I beat all of them except for Exodus and Joshua

Not exactly, Kandarihu.

Bye.
It's....sort of absurdly confusing.
seeya DoctoDoctorWho...oh
2,14 dont
2,14 spoil
2,14 anything
He lives
ValtheJean, sorry... for inducing
:trollface:
I didn't elaborate on purpose.
/me spoils everything
I know better. >_>
NewSuperBronyU: stop hiding
like we said, he's been sleeping for thousands of years and jus happens to wake up
/me looks up the ending and links it
:D
SPOILER ALERT! Lyra` cant even WAIT for season 3!
Tidus: Forever a fail
Hey guise
I don't spoil everything. I keep everything preserved so it won't. :P
This is all fake :3
GODZILLA
Hi, sonicdude558. :)
Oh, it's just Sin.
I made a big spoiler!
Spoiler Alert! Neigh-ther can I :P
oh Cypresswolf <3
He ded
the water its attacking :o
Spoiler Alert: This is all fake
Cypresswolf oh no need to horse around
puns
Why are you not dead? D:<
:)
He lives
He's floating in water UPSIDE DOWN.
told u
HE CAN"T BREATHE LIKE THAT. :|
1000 years later
they just spent the entire game breathing in water
Oh god, this guy.
XD
so apparently, they Can breath in water.
was that Billy West?
Cypresswolf, I'm thinking that too. Perhaps the Al-Bhed were extinct for a thousand years.
Wait, doesn't he sound like Bender/
*?
what a kick\
2,14 he IS bender
Goooooaaaaaal!
ah.
himself: That's never explained, ever....one of the things that bugs me about this game. >_>
brb I am gonna transfer to lappy
Apparently water is easy to breathe in.
CriticKitten: well, its at least obvious that floating facedown wont kill him
fry: i hate this world, i have no life, no job... bender: and no friends xD
now to draw straws to see who has to find the ball this time :P
GNIGHT everypony
ah Wakka, has a very strange weapon
ValtheJean: be sure to avoid dat lightning
Night, Bronysith. :)
....Do my eyes decieve me?!
G'Night Bronysith
night Bronysith
Well, videogame characters breathing underwater is at least more commonly addressed than spacecraft having gravity.
himself: Only if you ignore the properties of water,
night Bronysith
....wait
bai Bronysith
....TIIIIDUUUUUUUUUS. *shakes fist*
those imosed faces
CriticKitten: -sci-fi game-
Didn't Rikku just tell him not to mention Zanardkand?
*imposed
Good job dumbass. D:<
or fantasy
11,01Is this FF X?
Nittany_Discord: yup
mmhmm
Yep. :)
Nittany_Discord, yes
11,01K.
/me puts Nittany_Discord in a pillow
?
brudda
11,01At least it's not a maid corset.
Bro, broceidon
God of the broceans
/me beats said pillow
himself: Sci-fi allows me to believe that you have warp speed travel and phasers that knock people out. It does not allow me to believe that water works differently because of reasons. :p
but I thought you love those <3
why cant it be a maids corset?
2,14 here's a thought critickitten
/me puts Lyra` in a maid corset
2,14 rather than focus on the water
Hiya Val :3
/me puts Nittany_Discord in a latex maid corset and leaves
/me looks so purty <3
2,14 why not believe the people who can cast MAGIC also can breathe underwater
^^^
How?
11,01Bronysith is going to be the new channel maid soon.
:D
2,14 because they aren't human
2,14 different species, different rules
Hi again guise
2,14 so stop bitching about such a stupid ass thing
/me protects Bronysith
dat!
They never cast spells in the water. And old Zanardkand was a high-tech place, wasn't it? :P
/me falls asleep
can i be non-human
ive always wanted to be a sea pony :3
Er, rather, they never cast a spell to breathe underwater before going in water.
Hey Bronysith
2,14 you are missing the poin
2,14 t
So what, is it always active? How does that sorta thing work?
CriticKitten: oh for the love of cheese, give it a rest. if youre going to whine about these things, dont watch games with MAGIC, ALIEN RACES, scifi
2,14 they are BIOLOGICALLY different
2,14 so shut.thefuck.up
/me shoo be doo's Lyra`
Yo himself
sup sonicdude558
/me 11,01hugs maid Lyra`.
ValtheJean, stop yelling! youre driving this family appart!
/me slaps himself across the face
ooooooooo
/me cleans Nittany_Discord
oooooooo
sonicdude558: syop hitting urself!
*stahp
You're getting way too stressed out. I'm asking how people who are clearly human are able to violate human physiology, and you're flipping out. It's just a question.
lol
0,14...Did I come in at a bad time?
CriticKitten: and you are arguring with a mod
ya
2,14 you've been bitching about it since the beginning of the game
CriticKitten: uh, same way magic works?
SaxyPretender: you have no idea
2,14 and I'm not in the mood to go through it every fucking time there's a water level
0,14Duly noted
/me pushes SaxyPretender out of chat into safety
You know what? I'm working on a science fiction series in which the ships are designed AROUND an artificial gravity system, and it's a simple one too: dark matter cores.
Well actually, I've been bitching about it since he fell into the water after the boat attack, so about five minutes ago. But seriously, chill out.
Just keep swimming~
/me come my little saxy , its not safe here for you
2,14 bullshit
You're, like, WAY overreacting.
OH GOD FISH.
alright, how about we say, they can breathe underwater, is that enough for you?
fish are friends
not food.
2,14 you've been saying it since blitzball, which is the beginning of the game
2,14 so knock it off
I ....wasn't here for that sequence, so yeah, no.
CriticKitten: yes you were
I came in AFTER Sin arrived, remember>
*>
how about this, stfu or gtfo. If you dont like what is streamed, no one is putting a gun to your head to make you watch :)
turn them fish into sushi
*?
CriticKitten: you just really like saying loud things. i mean seriously, its a game with magic in it, does water-breathing really seem so ridiculous
11,01Can it, please. It's just a game, and game logic doesn't follow real-life logic.
^
^^
and neither does cartoons
^^^
or anything fun
Okay seriously, what is the deal? I ask a question, the mod flips the fuck out, and suddenly everyone's asskissing him? Can you all just chill your jets? I asked a question, I'm not insulting your mother.
physics can be fun
ʰᵉᴵᴵᵒ
fuck physics
obviously these people are part fish
/me levitates to bed
bong bong
........hello?
CriticKitten: bye bye
/me kicks Bronysith off the bed
Whos Playing FF10?
but my mother can brathe underwater
hi flutterchu
CriticKitten: it wasnt in a form of a question, it was "OMG THATS IMPOSSIBLE, HES FLOATING FACE DOWN, WTF GAME" and yes, it was in caps
That's a lot of fish.
Laurayne Val
13http://fav.me/d5h9e1y
Well, I agree with CriticKitten in that this is something that deserves an explanation. Frankly, I'd be satisfied with some simple handwaving.
/me can breathe underwater
SO LONG and thanks for all the fish
Love That Game
13a wild canary canary appeared :D
:O What will Canary do?!
Blame it on the parts of Macross Zero I watched this afternoon.
himself: Yes, and the response to my question was "OMG WTF WHY YOU ASK QUESTIONS RAWR". Relax, dude.
haha bronysith you don't even notice u fell of ur bed :D
11,01It's not ass-kissing. It's just getting a bit out-of-hand.
It's a game, a game I already said I *like*. That doesn't mean it's perfect.
/me flies into Shizu's mane and nestles there.
/me slaps Bronysith in the face
CriticKitten: it wasnt even a question, so nobody said "y u ask question".

Fun fact: FF7 and FF10 are apparently in the same canon. I....admit I still don't know why or how. But they are.
Now?
Got it
CriticKitten wha?
is this that PETA pokemon game i've seen flaunted around?
11,01She must be hot in that black dress.
Buytoast, I guess I should check that out some time

Hi, therainbowvortex. :)
11,01Hi therainbowvortex.
hi therainbowvortex :)
Dken2021: Yes, seriously
hai therainbowvortex
2,14 it's an indirect suggestion, but it leads to the possibility of 10 being a prequel to 7
Whick host is streaming?
The devs actually said the two are in the same canon. Go figure.
CriticKitten: It's that the kid from FFX and FF X-2 is the ancestor of the Shinra corp-- and later they went to different planets and eventually create Materia Generators.
:o
Val is.
O-Griofa that would be the guy with the grey-navy texyt
I think it was a marketing ploy, though, to link the two most popular franchises.
two shots in the same CANON!
praying is for chumps
but, theyle only go half as far :3
Buytoast, praying is for champs
Kencolt: X-2 ya mean? I don't think the kid shows in X.
you spelled chumps wrong there son
You spelled champs wrong there.
CriticKitten: Hmm... I think he has a small cameo, but you may be right.
oh shit donkey kong looks piiiiised
oh look, it's thew most underrated character in the game
Dken2021, the Boba Fett of FFX?
So how was this game received in terms of ratings?
blue mages get no respect ;_;
Underrated? Hm....I'm guessing it's Blue Chewie?
Chat is silent?
Hai everypony! Is my chat derping?
hi, DerpyMuffins. Nope. :)
So quiet
hi DerpyMuffins :)
I know. :d
I think they're shocked I called him Blue Chewie. I must be racist against Ronso.
hi DerpyMuffins

What is this game? xD
hi QuinnThePegaSistta

Why does this look like a Final Fantisy game?
Because it is.
DerpyMuffins: Because it IS.

Never really was into FF that much
Understandable.
It's more of an acquired taste, I think.
yaaaaaay
CriticKitten: yeh most JRPG's are an aquired taste
derpity fuck fuck fuck!
Sort of like how people tell me beer is an acquired taste but it still tastes like pisswater to me. :P
Damnit
That's a Laser-powered Yay
and fluttershy kills
Er, a laser-focused yay

CriticKitten: everyone has their own taste in beer, gotta try a bunch of different brands before you find your favorite
They dont have max repels in FF?
Oh, whoops. I haven't cleared Hoelbrak yet. :/
You know, I played this game a dozen times back in the day-- and never noticed that that summons has boobs.
Kencolt: they take on aspects of their summoner
The dragon thingie?
DerpyMuffins eenope
Yeah, it's....weird.
This game is pretty badass
I hate computers :(
Well I prefer Vodka over wine, and Im part french
Kinda wish they retained the combat.
It's probably some of the best combat in the FF series.
One of the best things about this game was the ability to switch your characters in midbattle so as to have whatever talent you needed at the right moment.
i liked the non-class character system
Yeah, it all felt very dynamic and alive
Wine has a very high chance of having big legs in it...

no stream

Well, I was kind of hoping it was gonna come to some sort of stopping point to be honest. I was worried that this was going to go on for a few hours and I'd fall behind on showing my mom another episode of Macross 7.
exzact same time too
O_o
I can't exactly thank the people who caused this to happen, though.
guess they go by time slots then
How come no one told me there was a new Camaraderie is Supernatural
Mfw no one seems to care except me that it John Lennon's bday :c
Catch you all in a bit brownie state

Stay awesome ;3

Dj_Cyber-4G, no. ValtheJean was streaming Final Fantasy 10. Then there ws some drama over roleplaying. Val wanted it to stop, NewSuperBronyU was okay with it. That caused Val to ragequit.

13so
13ponies
13i have a dilemma
0,14red pill
What is it, Shizuka?
13i want to stream bayformers rifftrax
To whomever posted the Animatic comic thanks, i really liked it.
I agree red pill
13but we try not to stream movies outside movie night in case they're picked
Bayformers?
oh, okais
red pill = pinkie pie powers
so yes
13will anyone be horribly heartbroken if i stream bayformers rifftrax
Do it shizu
AJIsAwesome: that is logical, I say this! http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lv4hn09dSZ1qbcq69.jpg
Depends what that is
Nope.
Shizuka: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STREAM IT
Wtf is bayformers?
your choice
13that is transformers as spewed out by michael bay
I'm sure we can live with it shizu
Go for it.
I won't.
Go for it.
I would say that's a mod talk more than anything
Who would pick it?
Do it Shizuka
13ooooor
In for a penny, in for a pound
13since i never see it voted
13what about spiderman rifftrax
SPiderman?
Which?
There's a rifftrax of that?
Spoderman?
13the tobey maguire ones, not the new crap ones
again, more like a modtalk than anything
You wanted it to be more black?
Do both.
13i am asking you ponies :)
That'll be interesting. Go for Spiderman. :)
13carpe carpe! seize the fish!
^
well I gave my opinion
Iv ealready seen spidermans, i havent seen babyformers
Shizuka: I could go for some Rifftrax :3
Bayformers or Spiderman... spiderman
13explosions and clutter or explosions clutter and webs
Bayformers.
The latter.
0,14well, on the one hand
13one of them even has no shia lebeef
Thats assuming my opinion matters.
0,14Bayformers has the F-22
0,14but on the other hand, JK Simmons
Which spiderman
the one with that one asshole?
Theres many
Shizuka: Does randomly showing the Rifftrax disqualify it from being voted for?
I'm thinking of making it lighter, not darker. XP
alright i'm going to sleep, night everypony
13J_E_Smith71: nope
night Dovah
No stream at the moment?
Night, Dovah. :)

thats the charm, the bad B movies
Like Puma Man
TheMaster: Agreed.

Even Texas Holdem?
0,14I DON'T WANNA WAIT

Shizuka: Never played. But Solitare! Oh my! :P
DerpyMuffins: card game.
Texas Holdem has to be one of my favorite cardgames
not to mention its pretty simple
DerpyMuffins: Think so.

This Is. All the same it will never change you are all the same person so am I....
0,14...I liked 12 >.>
Rusty gets a girl in 12 right?
0,14yep

How long have you been streaming for Shizuka?

having the discussions about a movie's badness often makes it a lot of fun
AJIsAwesome: Don't set yourself up for it!
unless its babes in toyland
TheMaster: I actually do this kind of thing when I watch a movie; annoyings the hell out of people. xD
Stone edge just missed 4 times in a row ._.

Cya CCCP
TheMaster: Not lying; going to see the new Twilight JUSt to make fun of it. Oh, and taking a friend of mine cause she talked me into it. But I must have fun!
The twilight movies are great to riff on
Silver_Soother: Make sure you yell everything. :D
because of the bad acting
13i like how the plans rusty rattles off actually gives away the plot of the movie
AJIsAwesome: You know you did a good job when everyone is wanting to kill you. :3
Silver_Soother: Yep. :D
hah
:D
thats a funny reference
0,14I also like the Seinfeldian conversations
0,14also, Reuben!
Hey; it's that one guy that is everything but no one knows him. :P
SaxyPretender: All we need is some slap bass.
0,14indeed XD
AJIsAwesome: Life would be complete with a slap bass following me around. :P
Silver_Soother: Yes it would. :D
You can beat battle toads
So i just had stone edge miss 4 times but I still won the game

I use Japanese sometimes and I don't even know much.
AJIsAwesome: I use google translate to sound smart. :3
Silver_Soother: Don't trust it, though. :D
Google translate never translate right
When I wanted to be romantic I would speak in romania o:
i need to learn Japanese
You learn after a while
i do that all the time :D
AJIsAwesome: and DerpyMuffins google translate works just as well as youtube closed captions guessing the words. :3

Silver_Soother Yeah I wanna block someone but I don't have the heart too ):
The line where Ash says he never cares, I had a flashback of him and Pikachu
and I cried.
Arcane_: I normally don't block people unless they REALLY annoy me.
DashWithRainbows: With laughter?
13DashWithRainbows: so did everyone else, there's already art of the peta ash breaking down and hugging pikachu anyway

Flat?
13apartment
13never did understand why brits call them "flats"
Sumerpan: The hero we need. Bob Ross: The hero we deserve.
because they're....flat?
13course... why do us murricans call them apartments
Oh whoops. Sorry to disipoint but it appears the map I played on was a costom map. :/
Because they have flat roofs?
IDK
Arcane_: They need to speak their mind so you know EVERYTHING they are thinking right now. "Never ever talking to you again" is code for sit down, shut up, and let me explain why you are wrong. :P
We're wierd.
08,01unfortunately, she is not single
because they're a part of....ments?
Not a offical map for MvM :/
Sorry
But the most important thing
Canadians are wierd.
ohh
13tenements were a thing, i think that's where tenants comes from
what color then Amu-chan?
13probably morphed into apartments somewhere along the line
RaveBrony: :D

NewSuperBronyU: I found u

CX
Shizuka: a tenement is a house that's been seperated into apartments
13oh
DerpyMuffins: He has a boyfriend.
/me hears music in background.... Thinks of the movie Rose Red.
Silver_Soother I figured as much tbh the head ach is worse then the heart break xD
A room or a set of rooms forming a separate residence within a house or block of apartments.
13thought it was more referring to the hastily constructed buildings during the immigration booms
You do realize the cheating can go both ways
it's mostly used for that, but can be used for other things
Haha

Ponies47: Test complete.
Your test failed Ponies47.
Gah chats derping agian
and shizuka said so am i
Hold on
13[23:16] [+DashWithRainbows] Great, now I'm craving for a sandwich, Shizuka.
13[23:16] [@Shizuka] so am i .-.
Who pinged me before?
oh
not me.
13whitejack~
You have no proof.
I really dont see how Shizuka is pregnant since she is only shipped with other females
well highly conveinent timing
Ponies47: I did and DashWithRainbows. :3
:D
speaking of
I'm an officer of the pokerclub at VT ^_^
AJIsAwesome: [05:17:42] <+DashWithRainbows> You have no proof.
What did you two say? :3
DashWithRainbows: *spits tongue*
Whitejack
0,14ahahha
:O:'(
You spat out your tongue?
Dude.
Ponies47: I said test complete and he said your test failed. :3
Lies.
You have no proof.
does anybody here follow ghost on twitter?
DashWithRainbows: U LIE
Nope.
Yes
U DO
It's my word against your's.
AJIsAwesome: No no before that. Before I h said test I could of swore someone pinged me before that
Don't make me go up and copy and paste the convo!
13wish val were here for that >>
Give me a moment. :3
K
Ponies47: AJIsAwesome said they didn't want to sleep anyway.
Ponies47 You use the client on the website, don't you?
DashWithRainbows: Yes. I need to switch to Xchat or something
weird...how I started drawing on an ipad but from there I changed to pencil and find that more enjoyable.
I use mIRC, not sure what others use but I like it a lot.
Shizuka: so true http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/star_ratings.png
mIRC is good.
[Alpha-Trinity]: Drawing with pen and paper is soo much more enjoyable for me as well.
/me uses HexChat because her mIRC expired and she doesn't have money to registe
LightIRC is terrible but I only like it for the pony emotes
register*
Ponies47 Really?
Just... Wow.
13ASoftFluffyThing: you know you can use mirc forever right
13it's like winzip
^
this is where benidict watches my little pony
winzip isn't free! pay for it, or else we'll remind you that it's not free!
DashWithRainbows: Pretty much yeah. If I did switch that would be the only thing I would miss
i dont feel so good, i just saw a picture a fluttershys eyes taken out and was tortured, someone hold me
Stallion_of_War: Will keep reminding you, for years. xD
I'm glad I switched.
/me holds superretroworld
It's okay....
I use pencil though. I don't like the dark shades of a pen. Plus I can control the shade of a pencil as well as texture by applying a certain amiunt of pressure
The emotes become annoying after about... an hour on an active chat.
amount
Silver_Soother: thanks, its scary from the anti bronys
0,14ahahha
I wanna get a second monitor for my desktop so I can have the chat on one and then I can do other things on the other
It disturbs me at first ...but I adapt
Ponies47 Just for that sole purpose?
You need to think of more benefits.
i wanna get 3 monitors just to have the chat on three seprate things :D
Ponies47: playing tf2 and chating on another, thats cool
13Ponies47: like me :3
Shizuka, I had mIRC on my admin account on my computer and I had it for 115 days. Then when I opened it one day, the splash screen had only the register and cancel buttons. It would close if I pressed cancel.
Yay!!! I love Rifftrax! Oh, and hello Bronystate! :)
Shizuka: Indeed. Just like what you do :3
13ASoftFluffyThing: xchat
13or get an extra computer, install linux on it, and use the best combination ever
13irssi + screen + PuTTY
Shizuka, I have XChat and HexChat, though they're the same thing
Silver_Soother: i feel better, thanks man
I think it's time for sleep -_-
I think I'm gonna switch to Xchat soon or after I get a second monitor
superretroworld: :)
night emangamer
Shizuka: Is is hard to hook up a second monitor?
Shizuka, I'd install Linux on my other laptop when I finally get the money to get it a new hard drive.
13only if your card has the extra slot
0,14methinks Shizuka likes that idea :3
Night, emangamer. :)
13most do
night emangamer
13generally graphics card will have a DVI and VGA connector
Cya leter emangamer
13DVI for your main, VGA for your second works well
this was made by a drunk midget: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1202578/General.png
Shizuka: My computer is a 2012 model so yes it does :3
13HDMI could probably get you a third
Shizuka: I dont know if you can hook up one to vga and one to HDMI
13well, i'm hooked up to DVI and VGA on my card
I think my next screen will be HDMI for gaming.
I'm using VGA because I dont have my HDMI on me
night everypony
yeah....I don't think I'll need more than one monitor :S
HDMI is the way to go nowadays
ALright every pony im going to take care of this me being spammed issue once in for all ill be back in a bit.

The only card port on my Dell is for SD cards, projectors, ethernet, and 4 USB ports.

13speaking of dennys :3

AJIsAwesome You could've just posted the message
13now it's usually cell modems, not sure what else typically is used
can we watch regular #13 after this?pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease?
DashWithRainbows: You just served by the best my friend. :P
DashWithRainbows: The program I used couldn't o that.
Shizuka: I have a question. Why does my computer have a phone jack AND an ethernet jack

I just served by your best friend?
0,14...which reminds me, I should ask
emangamer: For Dial up.
Hmmm
0,14ARE YOU OKAY?
PCIExpress is the standard for video cards now, AGP was the old, and PCI was the previous
SaxyPretender: no, not if they have the power of BAD WOLF attached to them
BAD WOLF
inb4 cue tennant
13emangamer: phone jack for dialup networking and or using the system as an answering machine, ethernet for modern networking

Say Saxy has a bad opinion, you'll appear to be something on the lines of being ill. This is then followed by a kick by Bronystates Janitor/Pilot which cures your problem.

13now i just have to wait for delivery >>
Shizuka: Good luck with that. :P

Are there any good Linux platforms to use as a LiveUSB, besides Ubuntu?
I have a LiveCD of Fedora but can't do much on it. The interface on it is nice.
13damn small linux weighs 50mb iirc
13fits on a minicd
13boots crazy fast
I'd prefer a LiveUSB with an external hard drive because lotsta space
13if you're pondering ubuntu go linux mint
Hi fellow bronies.
13ubuntu's taking the highway to stupidtown
Ohai Kinixys
Hi, Kinixys! :)
Hiya Kinixys :)
hi Kinixys
:)

Hmm, an hour of sleep will do before college. See y'all around.

Goodnight Dash-oh well
<.< >.>
AdamTheDuck, AJIsAwesome, Silver_Soother, thisguy, thelonepony: thanks!
13cinnamon is pretty sweet WM
Bye dash
Shizuka, which one do you have? Cinnamon?
13and since mint is descended from ubuntu it gets debian's stability, ubuntu's release cycle, and none of the stupidness of ubuntu design
Cya later Dash- Aw....
13yeah using cinnamon, tried mate but it was kind of eh
13cinnamon is sleek as hell
Shizuka: All those words I dunno how to say.
