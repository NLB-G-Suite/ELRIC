its a good idea
Aww Spike!~ :)
05correction
legalise and regulate
lol Spike
I don't think any recreational drugs should be banned
Dat Pinkie
I think they should be regulated and the companies should be taxed.
then we could lower taxes.
You gotta share
for everyone.
Lower taxes?
Really?
sure.
by legalising recreational drugs, absolutely.
City governments are trying to crack down on sugar.
05and spend the extra money on improving the service
05no?
You need a plus on things, not cuts.
why lower taxes?
because if you lower taxes more people spend.
and if more people spend the economy grows.
Yeah but if Governemnt can't spend, why should the people?
It'll offbalance.
well government needs a ton of cuts.
drop politicians wages
or drop expenses
but they're cutting the wrong things.
I'm suprised we're having this discussion in a sensible way. <3
that they do
05im not suprised i havent stopped hugging twilie

05heres a thought
Just one?
Wow, RD spins alot.
7Nice hat
Heres my solution to American government... LESS IDIOTS IN GOVERNMENT
the problem is they try to cut the wrong things
they cut education
they cut all this stupid shit
05also
instead of cutting politicians wages
05lending roofs

I generally consider the act of sharing and accepting that which has been shared is a natural right.
or at least play one of the games for more than five seconds
05point is
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84PZbL_-jjU
05that is my view of said matter
13Mega_Milk: if you break an arm in the us you go to a hospital and they brace it
13hospitals are not allowed to refuse care
7they at least looked up Ghetsis
13but care costs money, someone has to pay for it
Gotta go, bye!
Ciao, everypony.
bye
05Shizuka not saying its being done right
05im sayign how its suppsoed to work
the us have three times the health care costs as other developed countries. but the results of the us system are still sub average. it needs reforms. urgently
05ill be goign live soon
There's bad sides with our system as well
Only government system that isn't fucked up is Salamias
the system is broke yo.
I dunno, I don't mind my current government. I mean, they lie through their teeth, but it seems people have figured that out by now.

the only problem is that you have to use a first gen iphone :P

AJIsAwesome|Reading:i meant the first one...
Do you mean, HG/SS?
that top comment "Fun Fact: The music isn't instrumental.It's actually the hundreds of cries of numerous Pokemons' ghosts.So you're actually surrounded by hundreds of ghosts whilst๏ปฟ visiting Lavender Town."

Roll 1d100 for sanity loss!

Underwater combat~
dat midi
i knoe i'm sayign that ff13 continues to disapoint
1st one sucked
2nd one
and 13 was afull jsutr afull
A shame he didn't
was XIII really that bad?
10-2 was not as bad as it was rated

Sometimes the stories in FF games look fun, but the gameplay doesn't call out to me-
to me 7 and 6 are the most enjoyable, but 10 has the best story to me
eww I hate bananas
/me runs as fast as the speed of sound
vegout?
mindlessly play
like not heavyily invest in
*aint
not very stressfull
except 13 fk 13
dari is hungry
no i haven't only 7 onward
No you're not. :P
No.
yes
NOPE.AVI
you cried.
2,14 it saddens me when people dont remember how FF used to be challenging
Titus doesnt need food
titus
It was challenging, as far as I remember, but I didn't like the combat system
i played 7 and 8
the mai nsotry was not the worst but those optional bosses
ok, funs over
dem optional bosses
I was just kidding
All games used to be challenging, Val
2,14 FF6 WAS hard when you didn't know how to abuse every boss fight
I don't know that story because I barely follow company history
:D you're suposed ot suplex the train
Rikus bondage
TARA STRONG LADIES AND GENTLEMENT
have we past the key-mon part yet?
Tara?
:)
Oh look, fanservice girl
the first one on the NES was hard because it wasn't playtested right and filled with bugs
i prefer the 10-2 costume :3
leather crotch strap = armor
I never tried Suplexing the Phantom Train. Is that instakill?
How?
Yes
plot shot
I don't know the exact reason, though.
she's underage fro chriast sake!
Okay.
from TF2
oh and the kamehameha isn't silly enough
Owch
jeeze that Dari is such a whiner :)
Reused audio
I understand him, idiot.
Tara Strong Ladies and gentlemen
<3

she'S EVERYWHERE
I've been thinking of dyeing my hair a lighter color... XD
/me 's body turns into air.
Tara is good
she voices everything... including you
:o
x.(\ tutorial time
Hehe
Her VA shouldn't change how you feel about a character
^
Pedo.
Val, she's underaged
:D
/me thought she was 14
same
Val Rage?
Aw I'm just teasing. :p
Rinoa is best ff girl
This afternoon I was looking up techniques to achieve that without bleaching.
j/k
Well, she played a 14 year old girl
oh cool
don't remember anything from F8..or wahtever I borrowed
:3
:D
Intentional.
Rikku's primary purpose is underaged fanservice.
No, really.
brb one sec
random battle!
Though her design says 18+ she is underage-
Well, I think dressing in a way to appear nearly topless is going a bit too far with fanservice.
but--whatever, you know?
Wait until you see her default outfit.
just beat on the terminal till it opens
Or, heck, her FFX-2 one
banging on a keyboard, a genius he is
That one's even worse. XD
Yep.
of the s1 premiere?
Oh, my.
http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&size=l&tid=10772382 <---- That one.
Nice
/me clears mind
FFX.
But mostly because of its mechanics.
And there's no room for bare breasts in my vision of extreme fanservice.
Really? I didn't like it much-
Story is pretty lackluster and some of the characters are just awful.
aah hehe
Buuuuuut I adore the combat and the sphere grid is pretty nice
Dat percussive maintenance
/me was not a console kid
TENTACOOL!
Why did it have a grenade in the first place? :D
I used my first computer when I was 3
Or maybe I was 16. I'm not sure

Fun fact: FF7 and FF10 are apparently in the same canon. I....admit I still don't know why or how. But they are.
Now?
Got it
hello every pony
2,14 it's an indirect suggestion, but it leads to the possibility of 10 being a prequel to 7
Whick host is streaming?
The devs actually said the two are in the same canon. Go figure.
:o
Val is.
I think it was a marketing ploy, though, to link the two most popular franchises.
two shots in the same CANON!
praying is for chumps
but, theyle only go half as far :3
you spelled chumps wrong there son
You spelled champs wrong there.
oh shit donkey kong looks piiiiised

Underrated? Hm....I'm guessing it's Blue Chewie?
I know. :d
I think they're shocked I called him Blue Chewie. I must be racist against Ronso.
yunas VA isnt very good
FFX
yup
Yep. :)
a Zu?
Because it is.
because it is?
Never really was into FF that much
Understandable.
It's more of an acquired taste, I think.

Oh, whoops. I haven't cleared Hoelbrak yet. :/
