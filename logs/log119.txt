Hey, everypony.
!s2
Season 2 begins in 7d:16h:49m:22s
Good afternoon, Bawss.
Well, I gotta poof. School and all. I may come back on sometimes though. Thanks everypony!
she seems more, I dunno, worried than in middle school
not worried
hay IAmBawss
Alrighty--....
And he left quickly
Psh, school at 23:10
It is spelled "IAmBawss" but it is pronounced "Throat Warbler Mangrove"
Such lies. :(
Asian?
and back
Well, High school is where it accounts.
Name that reference, lololololol
05this: www.livestream.com/johntb
yeah
well it appears to be a link
That too
a link leading towards some place
Nah
it's very....linky
Damn it.
whats with the stream
i once was
my school is an early college
05no shit
virtually everyone there is going to go
:P
the side scrolling ones
early colleges let you take college courses
starting in sophomore year
Probably something rainbow-ish
Single straight burst.
Most schools have AP programs.
what's an AP program?
Or IP, whatever they go for.
well there might be pre-stream of some sort...
By the way
Jamestown is amazing <3
you mean IB?
Lol, yeah
I could do melee attacks
Never really had any of those.
Backwards heart
my middle school was IB
But AP usually lets you carry them on to college.
it was a great school
That is one awesome movie.
I don't really like melee on them unless it's Vasara style where you do slashes strong enough to repel bullets. And only after charging it up.
I don't think IB counts for some colleges or something.
I was thinking of something like a flip that creates a slash
05like always then
lol
Have her carry Applejack
I never learned anything about IB and college
u_u
or AP and college, really

Looks like Veemi's working.
:D
For the moment.
I was thinking of giving her a fluttershy assist
/me hands out cute koalas to all..
I like fics
05hi sathi
especially when you know the author and can influence it
well
only when that works out
I've got the Veemi stream open in one tab, and the UStream one in this tab and neither of them are doing anything...
noni
Truth be told, I'm not much into most books. Ends up rambling instead of telling the story.

0Alright, that still works at least
Veemi's working for me.

I suppose that we're waiting for the pre-show to start at the moment.
need to reload the page for it to work, I'm guessing...

It's a troupe.

That's not necessarily a bad thing.

a ton of people died
I'm pretty critical about how something ends.

that's pretty bittersweet
there's also a BMN group
You'd think Derpy would link to Pinkie if ADHD was mentioned
AAAAAAAA

Suddenly!
I was loling about that tbh. I was thinking about the people dying, but no, it really did come across as trying to be too happy-ish.

kk- I'll start working on them. I'll repost when I have them finished
I guess
11Thank you, Val. They're awesome.
I don't realy pay much attention to that sort of thing
Endings are the most important thing in a book (IMO).
YOU SHOULD HAVE POSTED THAT EPIC TRIXIE BY NOW
9Lol, echo?
05i wouldnt say that :o
I saw it

that's the correct one
And this was a slice-of-life story too.
SUPRRISEEEE
there was a book I read recently
07maybe you have the stream on mute?
TBH the stream is somewhat quiet
yea but I didn't want to whore out my channel
I don't have it muted, it's at full volume
Hm?
heh
Stream is quiet.
yeah very low volume
11Ah.
Don't mind it, we all are attention horses!
:D
then he lived
Oh.
Cause my headset hates anything above 5 volume, as far as it knows it's more like 95
it worked IMO
lawl
There we go, thanks Luna~
get a decent set oif speakers :)
lol :P
I think it went well, and there was some good comments
Especially me, heh
Winter Wrap Up, Winter wrap up.
there was also a bit of disappointment
I do have a fairly good set of speakers, I just prefer to use my headset. Force of habit :P

Well, either way

It was fun
yeah
O.o Wow, you're doing a marathon?
but that was still their opinion
It was great
I'm not saying it's our fault they can't read
No problem at all with quality
It needs to be about 20% cooler.
that's just how it went =/
You should go to #bronystate if you want more talking. It seems most of the people on here are too busy. :(
Marathon?

You mean the one in the cave?
Yeah.
And then the forest.
07lol
07or that
Yello?
Yeah, it wasn't a good use of them at all. They didn't really ruin them for me, it had some nice ideas. But it wasn't even close to as good as the first episode with them.
07hello
I'm hardly, if ever, really awake during the day
It works.
But then again, as a villain, it's a hard species to write a story on.

dont really listen to much music, this is an exception
whenever I hear this song I cant help but thing about the song aboout Hanukka
hey there.
It's not my fault that's not sad.
It's just a song and pictures, as I said.
I can see the emotion it was trying to evoke, but it didn't really make me sad
2,14 NOTHING is ever emotional if you describe them in those kind of terms dari lol
0Prince-Dari, that kinda explains just about everything in media
Eyyy yo
I frankly have no idea

Go on rathergood.com and watch their classics.
sorry
I think the reason they won't sell Strepsils in the US, is because they have antiseptic properties to them.
Could a mod put 'Go to bronystate.net if the embeds aren't aligned properly' in the welcome message?
Which is weird, but *shrugs*
roushguy: If he complains, tell him to deal with it. Easier said than done, but...

Don't forget sockwear, that sturdiness in this case is kind of objective, since it takes qomething pretty sturdy to be able to break the sound barrier. Light sure, but still sturdy.

But, I'm just alarmingly similar to Twilight.
Anyway
And I suppose Luna as well.
Fanon Luna anyway.
MFW you guys crashed me. >_>
/me loves being right about things
Is this that Romance film? I was expecting... well, a romance
o.o
Eggplant killed Cantalope >':
AHAHAHAHA
The mods did. :P
oh lol
it was on the fridge
AHAHA
I mean, I figgered he was gonna die..
07later
6I thought it was tomorrow...
You killed me.
Now that I made everyone in the room feel uncomfortable
sudden kill was unsuprising tbh
Fridge logic
2,14 it was only vengeance, nothing personal :P
05yay Aerosmith!
I now know how to curse in Italian
Radio graffiti is the only station I listen to!
the most suprising thing about that scene was Walken getting out-hammed by some random dude
11a041744: lol
13Haha
XD
Fridge has asnwers
THIS SONG KEEPS STALKING ME
Just not in the way you'd expect
I am great, yourself

4A Romance film written by Quentin Tarantino??? Yeah, don't expect anything completely "romantic"
8Where is the romance?
4OH
Eggplant. Trollololol. Wasn't expecting something like that
Finally, I got in
4Brad Pitt, bitches!!!
Oh

That was a Suprize buttsecks moment.
Fluttershy like...sets you at mental peace. You have no reason to be upset at her.
you know .. i have no links with him :D
Oh damn, Tarantino filmed this? I would've made an effort to have gotten here earlier.
alumonius the romance is between that guy's skull and the bullet
stoned like always
the Pitt is in the house...literally
I'd choose Twilight, she can magically shake hundreds of trees at once

Exactly
Twilight would be decent with an AA12, since it has little recoil.
GET IN JAIL! LIKE A BOAS
I'll message her in a few, I have to go help with something
FlutterBro, they are the same entity
I still say it's worth it for dem organ puns. :P

Twilight could use magic to hold any gun and not have to worry about recoil
and created an infinite world
13Ew lol
Dat hat
Hmm... I guess I should try to introduce her to ponies myself using my social talent.
0shes already healed?
DIS MUSIC
0ELLIS hat
Okay then
Reaver21 i get it now
fucken music
twilight would have ridiculous accuracy
Once everyone else is gone.
But she could only use that gun as much as her knowledge of knowing how to use it.
All I do is
k-k-k--k yeaaa
