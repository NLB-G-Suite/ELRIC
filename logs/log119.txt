My orange cat is not a lap cat, but he's friendly otherwise. The little one loved laps. http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/304183_283799614968261_100000146743751_1317676_5354700_n.jpg

Ah
:p

A young one. ;O
I feel old now. :(
My orange cat is Floof; the little one had been named Fluffy, but that was too close... so I was calling it "Derpy Muffin".
That is such an adorable kitty
:)
I remember my freshman year in high school. I ended up flunking English because I never did anything.
i wonder if i can load the model in c4d

My best friend adopted it and gave it another new name... because I can't get him to stand ponies yet. Problem is, his folks decided to nickname it "Snips"... :P

Hey, everypony.
!s2
Season 2 begins in 7d:16h:49m:22s
Good afternoon, Bawss.
Well, I gotta poof. School and all. I may come back on sometimes though. Thanks everypony!
she seems more, I dunno, worried than in middle school
not worried
hay IAmBawss
Alrighty--....
And he left quickly
Psh, school at 23:10
It is spelled "IAmBawss" but it is pronounced "Throat Warbler Mangrove"
Such lies. :(
Asian?
and back
If you say so... never mind me.
and what do I think of what?
Well, High school is where it accounts.
having a short pony music break today, and listening to some Nick Lowe instead. So. Awesome.
Name that reference, lololololol
05this: www.livestream.com/johntb
Might've been an aussie ^^
yeah
well it appears to be a link
That too
a link leading towards some place
Nah
it's very....linky
Damn it.
If you graduate and decide not to go to college, it follows you forever. If you do go to college, well, it still follows you forever. You can't go to Harvard on a 2.0GPA.
Anypony a fan of shooting games? like bullet hells?
whats with the stream
i once was
ahh quake 2... the good ol days
my school is an early college
I'm seeing a "2 hours plus" until next stream, so I'd say... nothing.
what stream?
05no shit
this is a different kind of shooting game =P
I like Sin & Punishment 2, triggerheart Exelica, DoDonPachi, Ikaruga and so forth
virtually everyone there is going to go
:P
the side scrolling ones
Not really.. Just played DoDonPachi, Vasara, PSI somethingorother and Ketsui Death Label. :B
Ah
if RainbowDash was a playable character
what would her attacks be?
right now I'm getting a red bull advertisement
so I can't really comment on the stream :P
early colleges let you take college courses
this is in theory but I may be making a Rainbow Dash bullet hell
starting in sophomore year
Probably something rainbow-ish
Single straight burst.
ah, there it does
Most schools have AP programs.
shooting isn't really cannon for RBD though
it's looking good wrek
With her 'bomb' being sonic rainboom
I was thinking of making her bombs the sonic rainboom
what's an AP program?
Your usual newbie character. ^^
Or IP, whatever they go for.
Yaaay were o air
well there might be pre-stream of some sort...
By the way
Jamestown is amazing <3
/me listens to Rainbow Dash's I can go the Distance video again
you mean IB?
so what would her normal attack be?
*checks schedule* Hell yeah, Rocky Horror Picture Show!!
Lol, yeah
I could do melee attacks
Never really had any of those.
Backwards heart
she's staring into my soul O_o
So it's her bucking enemies to face?
my middle school was IB
But AP usually lets you carry them on to college.
it was a great school
That is one awesome movie.
Sooner or later, I'm going to have to teach myself video making... I no longer have the excuse of having a junky computer.
I don't really like melee on them unless it's Vasara style where you do slashes strong enough to repel bullets. And only after charging it up.
I don't think IB counts for some colleges or something.
I was thinking of something like a flip that creates a slash
05like always then
oh, so i'm going to have to restart this entire thing again, i guess
lol
11Hey guys, if this is the new server, why are we using the old mod channel?
yea same but shooting for RBD doesn't really fit unless I gave her a gun and
I make AMVs and YouTube Poops when I have nothing else to do.
Have her carry Applejack
we all know guns + MLP don't really match
And AJ is throwing apples
I never learned anything about IB and college
I wasn't aware there was a new one >.<
u_u
but she would get tired from carrying APJ
or AP and college, really

I've been thinking of doing a pony bullet hell
Hey, it's a game
But I've been fairly occupied recently, so I haven't made very many.
05people keep getting kicked for no reason
But it'd just be Derpy flying with Dinky on her back shooting magic.

!link luna
http://e621.net/post/show/151126/alicorn-applejack_-mlp-blue_hair-book-cloud-corset
maybe have clouds here and there you can kick so they shoot lightning at foes?
...Well, that was a fail on my part.
@poopmeter Youtube
6 Youtube is 34% poop. (1516)
11they aren't, but this one isn't registered either. Not on this server, anyway.
oh
/me kicks Youtube in the nads.
be right back, I guess
I definitely want RBD to shoot something but I don't know exactly what yet
in that case: ponyshrug.jpg
Youtube has SOUND advertisements playing alongside their videos.
Is the stream everyone's watching the video with the skype sounds partway through, or am I still lost?
05there its up on the forums
g'day from the land down under
Have fun... I can hear someone watching the Dead Parrot sketch from Monty Python in another room, going to go join them. Wonder if anyone's done that with Philomena yet...
we know she can kick clouds to produce lightning
05btw love the newsletters val
11FloofCat: It has been done
yea but that'd limit her projectiles
Have her carry a cloud around
Looks like Veemi's working.
awww...ty Wrek :D
Silverscreen: adblocker > youtube sound ads
:D
For the moment.
that means a lot coming from an actual artist :P
I was thinking of giving her a fluttershy assist
/me hands out cute koalas to all..
I like fics
05hi sathi
ohai woona
especially when you know the author and can influence it
11Those newsletters are badass.
well
only when that works out
:D ty Silver
I've got the Veemi stream open in one tab, and the UStream one in this tab and neither of them are doing anything...
noni
Truth be told, I'm not much into most books. Ends up rambling instead of telling the story.
11Here's the thing though, we only send two newsletters, and the newsletter is sent to EVERYONE registered at once. So am I suppose to just cycle through which one I use?
SPACE
I have a cloud, hahaha!
Lightning shall smite you!
10Testing Color Boot Program
well, the idea was this:
0Alright, that still works at least
One thing I have to give credit to the Harry Potter books (Even if they aren't that good), it was mostly no-nonsense sort of stuff.
Veemi's working for me.
the newsletter itself is one giant image
so, you send one of us the text that needs to be put in there
no jään katto my litte ponia
and we organize it into various combinations of those boxes
Yeah, it's working in some way
0alrighty then...
plus a border or something, still working on that
upside down*
I have been assaulted by the Finnish language :(
0so what is happening in here
mon petite pony
it's been so long since I read them I don't remember very much about them
05hmm
05http://e621.net/data/c0/03/c0032864f308fe24e05b2dd7ccc6d237.jpg
they're basically like, templates if you will
damn... soi can load the models into c4d but they got no textures
I'm still not getting anything from either one
11Nah. It'd be too cluttered for the small amount of information that we put into the newsletter.
I suppose that we're waiting for the pre-show to start at the moment.
haha, that is awesome wrek
need to reload the page for it to work, I'm guessing...
I remember the last one was a little hard to read because it was so grim
11Now using each image as a background for one newsletter each would work perfectly.

Hey... I can see bronystate from Luna's screen!

in that case, if you want specific dimensions for them let me know and I'll redo them for it
Twilight told me this picture is about celestia bushing portrait artist:virenth
it wasn't that bad
Hey, there we go!
kill-them-all?
Finnish is a crime that can never be forgiven.
I'm gonna reconnect on the co.cc page then
It's what happens when you're desperate to come up wit ha happy ending. It comes across as being desperate.
Killing most of the characters off.
It's a troupe.
11 8.5 x 11. Basic paper size.
that would have too much negative impact
On top of that, he admitted to having ADHD, so bear with it
07omg can you!

/me waves at all the mods around
/me meows at Luna
Some of my favorite fiction has sad endings.
!link adhd
Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
/me hugs Luna
At the very least, a bittersweet ending would have worked.
Ohai Luna!
Oh we have stream?
We do!
a ton of people died
I'm pretty critical about how something ends.
11THe ponies themeselves can be any size. It's the colored background that would have to fit the newsletter.
There's a Brony steam group, yes?
friday movie night today!
I hink
Click click
that's pretty bittersweet
there's also a BMN group
You'd think Derpy would link to Pinkie if ADHD was mentioned
AAAAAAAA
If it doesn't develop a happy ending, it just comes across as trying to pay the reader off.
BIG ADVENTURE
MLP!
lol
:D
PONIES!
whaaaa
Suddenly!
And life was good.
I was loling about that tbh. I was thinking about the people dying, but no, it really did come across as trying to be too happy-ish.

bwaaahh
whoops
11Luna is streaming, right?
yeah
I've seen stories go from so sad to a random happy ending because they decided to throw that the character had come back to life becuase he collected all the 'orbs'.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRx1mCbwOdQ
05prepping more like it
that's the correct one
And this was a slice-of-life story too.
SUPRRISEEEE
But both basically link to the same video
there was a book I read recently
07maybe you have the stream on mute?
TBH the stream is somewhat quiet
yea but I didn't want to whore out my channel
There we go, much better.
I don't have it muted, it's at full volume
Hm?
heh
Stream is quiet.
0Yeah, it's kinda quiet on my end too. such is life
Why dontchya turn up your volume
it killed the main character, and there were tears and anger and stuff, and it was really emotional
yeah very low volume
11Ah.
Don't mind it, we all are attention horses!
:D
then he lived
Oh.
Oh better
That's better.
Cause my headset hates anything above 5 volume, as far as it knows it's more like 95
wow, much better
Much better
it worked IMO

There we go, thanks Luna~

lol :P
05been some serious troubles with veemi
11So, verdict on yesterday's Test on Live Streaming...?
White text iOS IRC client = way too much effort to read
I think it went well, and there was some good comments
Especially me, heh
Winter Wrap Up, Winter wrap up.
there was also a bit of disappointment
I do have a fairly good set of speakers, I just prefer to use my headset. Force of habit :P
but I don't know how much and to what extent
05and since the alternatives are out of the question after testing, we're hopin for the best
Cuz 2 morrow spring is here
Could it work? Sure. Is it likely without some sort of development to tell you that? Not really. If you want to do something like that, you better plan out EVERY detail.

but that was still their opinion
It was great
I'm not saying it's our fault they can't read
No problem at all with quality

Dunno the origins, but yeah

TOY STORY ;_;
0No. I cried already today from a pony video. Not again...
2,14 I still don't get why filly Celestia has pink hair
2,14 it kinda bothers me
It's from Jayson on Reddit.
Sad song and pictures
/me is close to crying.
Pfft.
D'AWWWWWW
Val; I'm pretty sure it's because she has pink hair during some of the scenes before the intro in Ep1
Because rainbows are hard to make
When asked if he was prepared from the massive amount of questions.
0It's implied that the high magic of her power caused the current hair of Celestia
/me haven't seen Toy Story 2 and still feels the sad
2,14 meh
luias plot
:(
My body is not ready!
lunas*
>not sad at all

And then the music resumes.
/me 0hugs Luna. "I will always love you"
NO :(
/me 0likes bananas
These pics are pretty well drawn.
^true
What is this song about
See Val Rainbow-ish hair
Maybe you get some sad music, the dialogue of Tennant's last few minutes in Doctor Who, and ponies together.
Spoiler: Celestia dies
Well, I think it's why it's used in pony related contexts.
07beautiful
lesbians.
Maybe then you'll be able to make me cry.
/me can't draw for anything
Somehow I doubt it though.

hey there.
It's not my fault that's not sad.
Dj pony needs a bigger role in the show.]
2,14 and lol Dari, naw. I just enjoy teasing you as revenge for all the trolling :P
It's just a song and pictures, as I said.
Sounds like the bunnies are talking about pr0nz
I can see the emotion it was trying to evoke, but it didn't really make me sad
"1 2 3 4 Bunny pron!"
What are we discussing?
2,14 NOTHING is ever emotional if you describe them in those kind of terms dari lol
Eyyy yo
I frankly have no idea
07Thunder_Dash you should feel it
So conflicted... on one hand, Minecraft version of the song is much funnier, but this has ponies....
Neither do I
...
I like the MC version.
2,14 ponies are boring. It's just animated images of hooved creatures
lol clip cutiemark

I can use most of the features correctly, including sockets.

Why Sean Bean always dies in movies?
:)
That's an interesting way to spell Rainbow Dash
O;
request Giggle at the Ghostie (Saltlakrits 20% Cooler Remix)
meowmeow

Silly robotpinkie, that's not how you spell Twilight Sparkle
I'll take you word for it (wtf are sockets?)

Sean Bean is a cool guy. He tends to pick awesome movies to be in.
MrPoniator have you considered taking something like Tylenol PM?
Pull the lever!

6Which chat? o:
Sounds pretty powerful to me
The what now?
LvS that's fine with a Cold, with a Flu, you have to drink Gatorade or Pedialyte to keep electrolytes in you.
/me speaks of it, and it's no longer dead.
Well we're not getting posted in EQD.
So...
why not?>
11Ghosties don't giggle.
/me 0is sad that Ghosties can't giggle
Because we got posted Thursday.
well, that probably helps, but i've never had anything that couldn't be fixed by just waiting
07oui
Hey Everyone
...well, okay, i broke my hand once, but that's different.
6. . . For tonight?
hey.
If Ghosties giggle... Do they vanish immediately?
oh silvermane
Basically if you've been pukey it might throw off your electrolyte balance
that's kinda...lame
Wish he would at least buck the post to first page.
FUCK GIGGLING!

There's no way to contact Strepsils asking if they could sell their product in the US
I have it on my pony playlist :d
Not at least without a long distance phone call or letter.
Yes I am proud to be a Brony.

11That...was.....AWESOME!!!

Me neither
actually sounds like Pinkie singing it if you transpose it down a few semitones
awwwwww yeaaaaaa caramelldansen time to dance!

Why do most Swedish peope hate Caramelldansen? I don't get it.

Danger of falling apart

I dunno, I think people just like being ashamed of their own country.
Of another...
I'll need to listen to Yakety Sax repeatedly to get that out of my brain
o.o
Wow.. I have never derailed a thread before.. =o
is there any way to get the chat and vid on the same level?
That's my theory and I'm sticking to it :P
or just drink

RAWRity: what do you mean?
How do I pop out my chat? :0
Rawrity go to Bronystate.net
MULAN
RAWRity: do you have a small screen?
so... i don't know what's going on.
05now this, is quality
love this
Stuff
if what dash said doesn't work, zoom out
RAWRity: try Ctrl+-
the video is above the chat, and my screen in pretty big
lol part 39
wow part 39 already?
bronystate.net won't load for me for some reason
SPOILER: trixie is a hun
YESSS
probably.
the video is centered
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Fallout: Equestria (Updated Part 39!) (http://tinyurl.com/6hemhto)
mine is below and slightly to the left
I'm slowly slumping into depression from...well... boredom
all those having trouble with chat and screen
Ennui.
Why is the stream so far to the right? I had to zoom out two more times than usual
go to bronystate.net
spoiler: All of the Mane 6 are men because of this video
alright, roushguy; is there anything we can do to help you get less bored?
more updated version
Suggest stuff to do?
silly robotpinkie
it's mare, not men
I want next weekend to come already ;-;
I can't play Deus Ex, my brother's playing it
6BEEE A MAAAAAAAN!!
to whomever posted the .net suggestion, thanks

I can't watch ponies, I think, because he'll complain.
BE A MARE
05BEE A MARE
13,1Sup
also, FUCK YEA second favorite Disney Song
ohai Everypony
I can't even listen to pony-based music.
awwe
Go on rathergood.com and watch their classics.
sorry
I think the reason they won't sell Strepsils in the US, is because they have antiseptic properties to them.
Could a mod put 'Go to bronystate.net if the embeds aren't aligned properly' in the welcome message?
Yeah apart from that N sound...
Which is weird, but *shrugs*
roushguy: If he complains, tell him to deal with it. Easier said than done, but...
Whut
@Elky good idea
well that's better, thanks.
because telling everybody might get old
would stop new people having trouble
Oh there's my stop
6Be a can~
I wonder if there's a PMV set to "Hell Fire" yet
Laterz
bye
That helped a little
thare!
here's something you can do:
only a little?
1. Pick a medium of art
look for Everypony raises your hooves high - Frontline PMV
please! :D
There are people having problems...?
and you had no problems befre?
2. Make something really beautiful and inspiring
I still had to zoom out one more time than usual I believe
I love this song now
that should keep you busy for a few years.
so are they taking suggestions, or is this all preset?
WOOT AWSOME
no idea
From the speed of it, I'm guessing preset
preset playlist
I'm only good at sculpting, and I have no clay or potter's wheel
As much as I honestly would love to use mibbit to connect to IRC, I think I'll stick with my client.
/me is not watching stream now...
fits rainbow dash?
Um...I'm searing everywhere on EQD and I can't find the old BMN post anywhere.
What the fuck?!
awesome playlist, also
Searching*
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Uv6XLHJYL8&feature=feedlik
molestia: I'm too lazy to make my IRC client's backgroud black...
alright, then... i don't know... read a book, maybe?
Bonjour
Found it.
I've read all the books I have here like a hundred times over
Nevermind, I found it.
âllo
then go to the library
Oh they finally got a new ask pinkamina
Nice
Is "talking to yourself on your facebook wall" lame, or crazy?
I'll be back later.

Peace out.

Want you gone is the new #1 theme

The gas volume inside the bubble would not change as air would be replaced with carbon dioxide
XD it scares me.
I just saw something about twisted Nederland in the related area? the guy that makes the Fail Comps?
hellfire would like to have a word with you
its a good game
oh, final question. I also need 1 more pony, a fandom one. And i dont know if it should be Lyra, Bon Bon, or Ditzy.
dash_with_rainbows: the tiniest bit. we only absorb about 4% of the air with each breath.
/me brofists herospirit

05scat, you are unable to change nick once inside bronystate, leave and re-join to fix it
While not fandom, Trixie is the best pony
No problem!
welcome to the herd
dark_heart: refresh your stream, sea ponies are over for us already
Sumica, you missed them twice.
OHOHO
Trixi is in it
robotpinkie that's what SHE said.
but as a villan
lol, problem Wrek?
Thank celestia for automized cleaning engineering :)
2,14 lol, I guess -n isn't on
I'm ok with that
Feh damn trafic
yea but air is only like 20% oxygen
I know
All clean ^_^
/me hugs ValtheJean gently~
05Sol ,no not really
we just need one more pony.
6I want your bantrident back too. . . v.v
its mostly nitrogen
Hey guys there a hot new dating site lets goo to it whoogeee
<3
I'll clean it...WITH FIRE!
OK, just making sure :)
isnt derpy enough?
Trixie can be a protagonist, antagonist, ally, or anti-hero
so if you obsorb 4% of the air in breath
This is really well done.
it makes me feel safe at night >.<
I've heard that you go crazy if your up high too long
There is also the Diamond Dogs, And Gilda
it needs to be like 20% oxygen
Hot, RAWRity
100% oxygen isn't good for you at all
thats 1/5 of the oxygen
Ohai Octavia.
Ohai Applejack
dark_heart: then why 'wow... this video... is ... AWESOME!!!!!'?
Ohai Applejack
im pullin out ALL the stops
afternoon Octavia
it is 20% oxygen
suddenly Applejack
ohay Octavia
Nah, Vaporization and cleaning disinfectant works fine
Octavia, so nice to see you again
AJ eh, must Be Dari now.
Diamond....DIAMOND DOGS!
Nopony wants to play?
/me waves at all the mods in chat
i cant now
70%nitrogen
That's a great idea!
100% oxygen will knock you out?
this is truly a Rainbow Dash video
HOW IS EVERYBRONY TODAY?
Ok good you made it Octavia
/me 11waves to Dermathil
05I just have fluttershy enjoying the garden, using the stare at tresspassers
its also flamable
05ohsit

I'm guessing it would be inappropriate to request one of the "Pony Thread SImulator" vids?
i want, but im about to leave from school
05forget i ever said that
13That too long enough. x.x
13Hey guys
woo dermathil
have been trapped here for 11 hours
05OCTAVIA
Don't light a match with 100% oxygen in the air
hey octavia!
but under pressure oxygen becomes toxic
Don't they use 100% oxygen in hospitals?
Nah, I'm about to turn on Castlevani: SOTN.
76% Nitrogen. 20% oxygen. 2 - 4% Argon. <1% everything else.
/me tackle hugs Octavia
the main villan hires them as a sort of bounty hunter squad and gives them a gift
/me waves at bjornfot like the local star he is
Weve never tested on diamond dogs before :)......Ohhh im gonna need send out a ummmm "search team" ASAP
yea pure oxygen is fine so long as youre not diving
Silversreen pfftt oxygen i just breathe in awesomeness
Oxygen is flammable by itself.
Blaarrgh. I can't write my fic on an empty stomach.
hi derma

"Well, Dash? Aren't you going to say something? Is this nitrogen not good enough for you?" --- "The air's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, breathable. It needs to be about 20% oxygen."
Wanna know the best team ever ;)?

Anyone want to volunteer to bring some Diamond dogs back to me? Ill pay you 500 bits per dog, 200 if its dead

2,14 he's too much of a "spam magnet" (haha, see wut I did thar?)
and the air would spontaneously combust causing massive fires to rage across the planet
>mfw people care more about Rocky Horror than something written by Tarantino

Alright.

Rarity invaded my dream the other night
I feel bad about leaving today, but I have something to for my classes.
this is going to be the best movie night ever
she stole something from me cant remember what though
My dreams remain rarity free
still waiting for the cake with 17 candles I get tomorrow
Heyheyhey?

I intend to keep it that way.
So what movie is for tonight, again?
It wasn't my fault
Maybe I'll see y'all tomorrow, everypony, bye.
my dreams have all ponies. Fuck yeah
Two awesome movies, AND PONIES OMFG
Stone...Hmmm i guess that Quatum demelcular density ray could break through
So, Rarity being my fav pony is making my NaPoWriMo fic infinitely harder to write

This is my favorite song.
So far Applejack scootaloo and rarity have appeared in my dreams
omg
Trees
Rocky Horror is great, especially if you know all the audience participation lines
RAPID FIRE POSTING
I can rave to this
thx
did i hear rocky horror?
id like to be a tree
I want pony dreams.....
This song...what.
So. . .this means we just need a Pinkie, Twilight, and Applejack song.
07yep
y u do that Derpy??
yes, rocky horror ^_^
We've now had Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and here Fluttershy.
:D
05this was a nice one
So why do you have 2 websites? Are you gonna keep em both open?
this song makes me think of double rainbow somehow
dunno how
scootaloo is totaly a chicken pretending to be a pony
Ill probably be in bed by the time rocky horror is on
/me is turning into a tree
Lol
is this song a parody?
You will believe a pony can be a tree
never watched Rocky Horror before, hope it's as fun as people have told me it is.
i keep thinking of portal
sounds familiar
also, if inception taught me anything- to have a pony dream you've got to plant the idea in your head before you go to sleep
because she's programmed to post updates on EqDaily on here
05Could anyone be so kidn and provide the link?
same here kanye
05or search termes
I finally beat portal 2 so now i know what you guys mean by spaace
07http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSLvjfrxynA
/me takes cotton out of ears
but more awesome
so imagine yourself in equestria- almost guaranteed pony dream
the distortion reminds me of the turrets
SCOOTALOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I love this song
Deal, ill get King C
any good portal/mlp vid?
Hmm..
Combustiblelemons: I have pony dreams without plating the idea :|
RAWRity: it's even better if you watch it with friends
OH! That reminds me. We need toast. And squirt guns.
planting*
dreams went crazy as soon as I started reading science fiction short stories

/me hugs Luna
Put a link on my IRC chat
!code 404
05added to playlist, thank you
but still good alone
!error
For those interested, this song can be found in Youtube under the name "Fluttershy's Lament "
07your welcome
combustiblelemons: I thought everybody always knew that, I did that kind of stuff to kill nightmares when I was a wee kid
200 dead, 350 stone, 500 alive, 600 if its unharmed
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
!givemuffin
elky I've had the chance a few times to go to cinema screenings, but the stuff I've heard about live shows made me want to avoid it.

Whenever i have nightmares i tend to fight whatevers in them
... huh. Still freezing up. Damn my internet connection.
so did i Dermathil :P
Good
My internets fine.
hehehehe
god damn ants!
I dreamed I was an Alicorn last night. True story
Ill get your pay, As i said, Leave them at the gate

all over my desk
Interwebs are fine on this end
I dont care
meh alicorns are OP
!void extern int x=x+1
Whats going on everypony?
So much Apple Pony love <3
It was awesome!
/me wonders how long the latest FO:E chapter is
They will be doing alot of bleeding in the next 24 hours

you should go to a late night screening of rocky horror atleast once in your life
I can't recall any dreams I have
!help
I am drinking
Murder the pencils and take blood whiskey for mooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!
:$O_O:'(
vodka and hypnotic
Anyone see the new on EqD
to finish off the bottle of hypnotic I have
13Wow, that 3D Trixie is epic.
lol
For season 3 probably confirmed?
yes!
Hi, my little ponies!!
then I will move on to vodka and redbull
it is!
third season confirmed?
3d spinning trixie is awesome
season 3 is possibly confirmed
Possibly
octavia yeah, it's pretty neat
no the Trixie
i have to ad vodka to my hypnotic because it isn't strong enough
RAWRity: that's exactly why it's so much fun; other than 40 year old people in drag ofc
Something from the Pinkie Pie singer article.
yeah well it sould like that
Hello, your majesty in socks!
I am purely jelly.
I'm not really surprised
Dermathil 37 took me five hours how long for you
IMO it was a typo
the guy/girl who makes those 3D ponies is really talented
I'm guessing we're in the middle of some sort of roleplay Spin.
13^
hi everypony
wuh Sklar?
fin
Lauren Faust should really check them out
Where are my diamond dogs!
I wonder how much an impact the whole brony thing had on pushing for new seasons
I think they'll go at least four seasons.
YAY
!?
I hope my req gets in here before the movie starts, I love the song
Dat pic
YAAAAAY
ugh
Dermathil FoE?
did you ask the chinese food restraunt?
HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG
aww yeah
... well this is weird.
screw this song
I love this song ^_^
WOOT
The chat box is white now.
oh gawd owl city
*gets flamed by people(
D'awwwwww
loved the original,
screw you Elky... :P
At least four seasons, cause we are a large, influental Fanbase of awesome bronies!
Avatars "outside" demographic didn't really seem to help it out so much.
now loving this even more
OH
man I love this music
:P
music for insomniacs
Helps me sleep *-*
Sweet! I'll play the role of the lurker.
I wonder how it would go if someone (Hasbro) decided to butcher FIM...

10000000000000000 Fluttershys

37 is the longass chapter I think?
Took me about 4 hours
Chopped in unexceptable
then again, a lot of that fandom was made up of annoying ass shippers so...
/me throws in 3 stone statues
DAT LUNA
Nice background.
whatpayne: what do you mean by butcher?
/me 11goes to put his pizza in the oven.

Dermathil yes
suddenly luna
Whatpayne, there would be torches and pitchforks
What song is this!!!
YAY I FINISHED CODING
New lunar republic ftw.
Ok thats 1050 bits
Lurking is not very fun... At least for me...
*lurk*
as long as Lauren Faust and the creative team is there I think the show is safe from meddling
The Luna Republic!
this is owl city parody- fluttershies i think
ok then.
its once they start slowly flushing the writers that you can worry
http://www.nautilus-solar.net/law_draw/ I'm a freaking machine, I swear.
yes it is
/me hands bits to Pon and andriods drag off the statues
Hey hybrid!
gratsi, i will now see if i can find an assistant
isnt Lauren not directing MLP though?
just don't lurk around my penis and we will be ok
Luna as Celestia's age/height = <3
HNNNNNNG
silverscreen... does it have a hole in teh middle?
unless you are a hot girl
05!
then thats acceptable
in season two?
hi r-zack
she's still there, she's busy being pregnant
mom just brouhg tme some popcorn
Come find us again when you have more..."Supplies"
/me goes to look for snacks
05my computer parts arrive tomorrow!
She stepped down from executive producer, I think.
but creepy neckbeards... my penis is a no fly zone
2,14 she is just not the main producer now
yes, some Luna Music would be nice. Hows about "lower the Moon"?
brought*
We will always pay
I'm a dude.
2,14 but she still has some influence
By butcher I mean rapping dogs, and constant pop-culture references, seaponies and whatnot
im ready for movies
then no hanging around my penis
I think (or at least hope) Hasbro is smart enough to not try and fuck with the show when they have such a big fanbase
User_2761: es okay I just can't Rp for the life of me so I rather not get in the way plus I have plent else to do on the internet
ohh good
Can we keep the penis talk out of the PG channel, please?
/me is lit up at higher lumos than the sun!
Defying Gravity!
NO RAPPING DOGS
NO
my bad wrong channel
hey everypony.
10 million fluttershy's.....my god!
NO
I still wonder why we still have pink celestias.
my windows got all messed up
hey spectrum!
let it run for a couple more seasons before movies.... movies bring money and money can make things go to hell
/me loves this song
i will bow out for now
Hasbro Y U BE TROLLIN SO MUCH?
hi
I just am astounded how awful all the toys look to me
Are there other chanels?
...Did someone say.,.. Wicked song?
synro it's a cuteness overload!
because pink seels, r-zack
Heya Dashie
Inb4 MLP:FIM movie.
/me sighs
That's why I don't go to EQAD
this is making me fall asleep
PINK celestia anyone? :P
Im not sure, Bjornfot
R-Zack: that'd be Past Sins
I need your opinion on something
This is why people need to learn to read the bucking topic.
Pinkcess Pinklestia is best Pinkcess
Is it mandatory for hasbro to make ugly looking toys for my little pony?
05who?
Molocule ray frequency is set!
10 million of me... o-o
was playing around with the weirdo settings and filters that photoshop has
PAST SINS SHOULD BE A MOVIE
I AGREE
everyone :P
I would be alright if them did like a Made for TV movie
/me hugs Fluttershy
I doubt Hasbro would ruin the show; they'd probaby just cancel it
I believe sold Hasbro do that they would face very angry very Brony crowd with torches and pitchforks.
Heya!
Fantastic

RAWRITY: Read the rest of Dangerous Business. IT'S AMAZING
hmmmmm
timelords and terror and mines of dragon mountain, but thats more for the doctor
I read a few lines of cupcakes and almost threw up.
/me loved past sins
that's not a bad idea
Silverscreen: My oven.
Pizza Planet
KayneWestEast MMMMMmmmm quite
okay
my favourite remix vid that i've seen so far is bronyquest...
My local pizza place.
that's creepy
ahah open all the avast videos at the same time
Dominoes
Silverscreen: FROM PIZZAPONY!!!!
Round Table
Pizza Hut
i'm eating pizza RIGHT NOW

what would have been a batter caption is "COnfound this testing, They drive me to pony"
13The dumpster out back of course!
Howdy, Twi. ^_^
omn nom pizza

A margarita pizza
Haha...wait.
What?
sephirdd: meh, I've read about the premise, and while it seems interesting, it's not really something I wanna chekc out.
actually tied between Pizza Hut and Dominos
silverscreen: a small time business pizza place
/me 11gives points to Sol for awesome reference and Espy for awesome response.
it's a local pizza place.
Silverscreen: This place by my house that gives my family a discount.
i'm slowly converting all of my dormmates into dr.who fans.
And Pizza Hut.
Wow.....diamond dogs brains are so tiny....
meh i don't like pizza hut pizzas.
i've only read cupcakes, bittersweet and the first couple of chapters of progress...
:)
RAWRity: Do it, believe me you won't regret :D
RAWRity: don't read the last two chapters of 'Dangerous Business'
GAH
CUPCAKES
hello there. just checking in
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
~Yaay~
they're awful
/me 11gives Dermathil points for relating his answer to ponies
also Silverscreen: my mom makes best pizzas
what elky said
Elky: I strongly disagree
Ohey, dangerous business got updated
Meh, Cupcakes isn't that bad.
Home made pizza is awesome, because you have complete and total control over what goes on it.
i will never eat cupcakes again because of this show
/me rushes to ED
but everything before that is awesome
11Dermathil: Homemade?
Diamond dogs seem to be a crossbeed of moles and dogs
Just don't read Sweet Apple Acres.
Massacre.
Ugh, TYPOS.
yeah
progress is great, but its going to lead to serious issues when luna shows up and doesn't live up to the fandoms "expectations"
Homemade are pretty good.
11epic
what does everyone think of bittersweet?
homemade pizzas? Tried to make my own, it tasted... soapy.
...how long does this go on?
I loved Bittersweet
I agree With Dermathil. Homemade = best
Soapy?
never read it.
I prefer delivery to homebaked, personally
11KanyeNorthEast: True dat
sad story was sad...and a scrubs reference
I found out my roommate put soap into it whilst i wasn't looking.
eeyup
digiorno
actually i can beat both Pizza Hut and Dominos

Rocky Horror picture show and true romance
I got the very last one in the story.
How does the Everfree Forest work hmm?
True Trivia: The trivia section in the DVD special features reports that Writer Quentin Tarantino sold this script for about $10,000. With this money he purchased the red Chevy convertible that Vincent Vega drives in Pulp Fiction

Elky UNI?
Eeyus.
Before I switched the IRCs back.

sotha - I got to meet one of the show's creators when I visited Cartoon Network.
TRIPLE FEATURE
she doesn't like kungfu?
I can't read them all.

look on the plus side, its not a Final fantasy movie.
hey hey hey, everypony! how're you all doing?
*rules read again and understood
Yeah
Bye Flutterbro!
So we lost a lot of people then and only had 232 or so max.

triple fail
Tim_Kangaroo: duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude
07as we're not yet using the new room plan
He's gonna kill her or something
Trialist?
Sister street fighter is about Kung fu nuns
This can be considered, "Normal Chat Speed"
Like I said earlier, a friend of mine was Line Producer on Megas.
I'm going to have to deduce that it's because Equestria itself is like separate dimsension from the rest of the MLP world, or each region has it's own Moon and Sun Bringers
huh, I don't think I've ever heard of this movie...
6I'm soooooooo waiting for the MLP episode!
it has gary oldman in it?!
its rather slow actually
hrep drep
There are so many crossover fics that havnt been done yet, or atleast ones that havnt been done very well
BRAD PITT!

07We have 2 people on trial tonight

13Oh boy.
Hobos, poor hobos.

Spazturtle: chromebook?
Tom Sizemore!

Sexy southern accent

Thats the way it goes.
05after 3 they get kicked
one could also assume the royal city was there before Canterlot replaced it
oh I know
/me prefers Applejack's accent.
I dunno, that's just how it's gone.
Yup, sklar, or well I'd say it's more than just good
I doubt thats a real accent
adult apple bloom
street fighter movie
but there are still people who do it anyway
half southern, half ghost accent
this
because "the kick is worth it"
WHAT.
Fuzzy?

I dunno...it's probably just me. But I really hate it when people do stuff like that. Like the "I'm logging off so I'll post in colors for the kick"
Nittany_Tiger, I've had an entire theatre to me and my friends. Of course, I was with my girlfriend and her friends..and the things I did were..definitely on the "do not" list..
I would actually call the Alicorns into question on that
Ive run up and down the theatre with my friends cos we were the only ones there
he ain't a good guy so much as a bad motherfucker
Pegasus, i would bet, are more like birds on the inside.
I've always imagined it as an expression of magic.
And I've read a few Creation stories online that explain it better than I ever could
Girl = Chun Li
this dude gives a distinkt "blueblood" vibe.

"You want this cake?"
My milk pie brings all the boys to the yard
my turn ons are..
Earth Ponies are fortified by magic in the physical sense. Unicorns and Pegasi are more squishy because their magic is either in their horns to be used, and with the Pegasi it is in their wings and hooves.
what boss hires a call girl for his employee's birthday
I found some old comics

RAWRity: It's about drugs, sex, more drugs, and more sex
Is it just me or is the movie not playing?
A Security Guard or Police? I can't tell..
RAWRity: A comic book clerk married a hooker, killed her pimp and stole a shit load of cocainer.
/me is waiting for his meatlballs to finish cooking.

...friends are forcing me to dress up as Irho from Avatar
yes, elky
No Pabst?
he's one of my favourite actors
Security, no officer wears a Tie..
HE LEFT HIS ID AT THE MURDER SCENE OGOD OGOD OGOD
this is a fanfic written by a much fatter comic book clerk
aponymous so the average day in LA then?
true true
this cast is absurdly high-profile
about himself
how did he cure from getting absolutely pwned in the face so fast?
Whut now Scraps?
Uncle Iroh is the best. ^_^
You can't tell time to speed up, unless you somehow convince Celestia and Luna to speed the day/night cycle until the 17ths
Eeeeeeyup
ironic
RAWRity: Detroit actually.
Y U NO PLAY TRUE ROMANCE?!
Doctor_Scraps: That's not bad
RAWRity pretty much
17th*
They got married already?
Wow.

(I'm in a lot of movies.) -CW
His face when
Damn they move fast.
his dad is a security guard
"You... married a hooker."
for a prison
I wonder if he's going to tell his father about the drugs...
and he commited murder :3
Dad is clearly disappointed.
YOU KILLED A HOOKER
Yeah, my circle go into Avatar and I have yet to watch a whole episode, so odd man out
Well.. that would have been interesting to see, dontcha think?
6 months is considered short time
Ah, that reminds me, y'all need to stawp makin' fun of Princess Celestia.
so we gonna get this threesome started or what?
She wants to make her boyfriend wear a ball and chain
this is like... WTF
Ohai Dennis Hopper
Why? She makes it too easy
"different places have different things"
Oh, she's a darling and a sweetheart
so are these two gonna be a serial killer couple now
okie dokie lokie
Okie Dokie Doggy Daddy
Well, she IS the ruler of Equestria.
okie dokie doggie daddy?
*engage arguing*
nope
That's so romantic
I ain't been makin' fun of Princess Celestia. Who's been tellin' y'all those lies?
This is like, "Hey, how are you?" "MARRY ME!" "K!"

Son: I am dissappoint
For a whore
Okey Dokey Artichokie
PINKIE! HE'S STEALING YOUR LINES!!

She tastes like a peach

SHE*
11"Tastes like Peach"
Peachy whore
Too much information for his dad?
Me thinks this is not about True Romance
he ate the peach
and teh butt
and everything
I just wonder if we will get to see Discord before the 17th, you know, via leaks...
This movie is totally romantic.
AND THEN THEY ALL DIED
Most romantic movie of all time.
slow it down maaaayn
SLOW DOWN MAN
Fuck your shit, I'm a bulldozer
So this is The Ugly Barnacle VendorPony?
We are mighty proud that y'all made this website!

DSNesmith keeps talking about eating pussy, butt, and everything. THis is liket the 4th time.
Umm
whryyyyyyyyyyy
>mfw Memories of days long past just got a BIIIIIIIIIIIIG update
4It's weird seeing Dennis Hopper as a cop when every other time I've seen him he's a terrorist
>Quiet movie moment, chat slows down
I would catch a grenade for yah.
MEANWHILE
I hope we hit 40 million on or before the premier.

I now know what I'll read for a little while
11Dennis Hopper.
>They told me I could be anything, so I became a bulldozer
That'll be kinda hard though unless we get a ton more F5ers.
11Bob-Bomb
he was bowser in the shitty mario movie
This fandom is crazy. What are we at, five fan-made games now?
Use the force, Luke
Bob-bomb?
FUCK THIS, IMMA BE A BLIMP
/me casually glances into this room...before he see Applejack in it*
"you married a hooker and fucking killed a guy?!"
A monkey! :3
OwO
Five complete fanmade games?
suddenly happy drum music
I kill for LOVE!

Wait, now I remember him! Monkey!
And the drugs. Don't forget about the drugs
Xiagu: where
/me glomp-tackles _AppleJack_ *
This goddamn happy music

*engange lionkingmusic*
ok replay the Clockwork Orange music
I only heard of ONE that was complete and that was Story of the Blanks.
i don't quite know how to deal with this music...
its lionking music
Yeah, it's like I told some hater on YouTube, this show has caused this much response on the Internet with only one season.
this music is approaching DS2 sound lulz status

11Sol: It's there, he just told them to wait.
Not complete, in development
cops will never notice the pink car
Better question, where's the chick with the...nevermind
This music makes me want to save the Rainforest
LOL
"I need you to risk your job and look up whether they know I murdered two people"
DAT Musical Dissonance
For some odd reason the music makes me want to watch a Disney movie
Music makes total sense. I swear.
I do
HE CAN EAT A HORSE!
I liked Story of the Blanks, but I wish that they had given us more insight into the zombie blank flanks and what exactly happened with Ruby.

No scootaloo for him
He could eat a pony.

Story of the Blanks is complete. Fighting is Magic is in-development. Fiend from Dream Valley is in development. There are a slew of pony mods, and an MMO is in development.
It's Glenn Beck!
-gets pale with stage fright-

Alternate title: Hey, It's That Guy: The Movie!
nice story bro
no
berta
she's very good at sarchasm
I have to ask ya'll a question, Don't tell Rainbow.
that's the name
quick question, what movie is this now?
not much of an audition :/
This film needs better pacing
That was totally 2 hands
Of course, AJ.
the maid from two and a half men
True Romance
Whose dog is that?
I see a hobo
Who do ya think is the better athlete?

Nice house.
You
all the way
Smallest train ever
Dash
sol this movie has awesome pacing
Dash....
ok :3
Pinky Pie
Are we talking with or without wing usage?
Sportsmanship, goes to Applejack.
speaking of which, i'm auditioning for a play tomorrow
O RLY?
Oh...then AJ
Bulu Boyle?
If no wings
how bout you?
gl gummy
honestly?
what play?
Booloo Boyle?
Big Macintosh.
:D
...
Lol
I just cant see the light /).(\

I just realized that Rainbow Dash's cutie mark is backwards... :( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pORikgqoT88/TmpoojHg-uI/AAAAAAAAL0U/HGcOJq-8KtM/s1600/ILtNQ.jpg
Do you know me?
"he was a mad wigger."
NO ONE CALLS HIM MAD DOG
I think you both are pretty equal, AJ
Blooloo?
or remember me if i have forgotten you?
Cos without wings I'd say AJ. With? Rainbow, no contest. I don't see AJ breaking the sound barrier.
YAY
did he say scootaloo?
Scootaloo?
Blootaloo?
happy music :3
Elvis was right
Haha, it is.
Well. I can't see AJ with wings.
Chicken.
scootablue
I would have to say Applebloom. I mean, c'mon, she went ziplining! :P
elvis is always right
needs more xilophone
:3
me and Fluttershy are watching the stream on a huge tv!
>inb4 everyone else
Elvis is ALWAYS right
Blooregard Q. Kazoo
So it would be a bit of an unfair comparison.
I WANT TO FUCKING WATCH LION KING RIGHT NOW
Oh, Elvis, you're so omniscient
Yeh, The Sonic Rainboom IS pretty cool.
11Wait, her name is literally ALabama?
Alabama, get away
yup
A bloobloobloobloo
I approve of your killings and former whore gf
I gotta go eat dinner.
07cool flutterbro!
lol
a one-trick pony, though
sweet whore alabamaaaaa
so to speak
D'awwww
-_-
Dat music.
:(
there is that corny music again
I am sad
Cutest couple /)^3^(\
needs more
MANLY HUG
i see whut you did thar
ziplining isn't really athletic, it's just hanging from a rope while flying above the ground at high speed.
this music is hilarious
But without wings, most likely AJ, Dash is a bit flimsy I'd imagine, in order to be able to fly in the first place.
11lol, DSNesmith
Tarzan music?
Lol
happy music :)
STILL needs more flute
africa music :3
Bonding over murder. *sniff sniff*
this is less cheesy than you'd think
i'm just waiting for this is pan out to a guy writing a self-insert fanfic
Dat 90s
This music is sooooooooooooooo fitting
this is the cheeriest murder story I've ever seen
amirite?
Save the god damn rainforest
...
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
LOLWUT
this loooks like the 80's not the 90's
Luna: we're using a Sony 3D plasma TV... I wonder if I get stream to work on this o-o

What's the address for this IRC chat?
then they drive into the river

Thanks to all them "years a' apple-buckin'".

Mmm
Tasty peach.

I do not believe we have ever mingled, I had seen your name before though

She taste like...
11I like peaches.
PEACHY
0"Tasted like a peach"
err.....Incest much?
Squick
A PEACH?
Is it alright that I want all of the main characters to die?
Put the two of them in a bucking contest, and no contest at all
Ya know it!
Don't forget sockwear, that sturdiness in this case is kind of objective, since it takes qomething pretty sturdy to be able to break the sound barrier. Light sure, but still sturdy.
So they had a threeway?
nope :3
sotha, no
yes sotha
Yes Sotha, it is
several do
I want the music to die
Lolwut.
sotha: it'll probably happen, so it's okay
0Dat music
It's Glenn Beck again
oh damn
/me waits for replies in his forum
Okay, finally got it to work! Thanks
dat music...again
alabama is lookin good
The mere fact her flesh doesn't peel off is a testament to her bodies strength in that regard.
Alabama's top doesn't look slutty enough
dem tits
*dances to music*
alabama whirly
Oh baby you KNOW what I like!
what a name
She might have hollow bones...I once heard a theory in a Sonic fanfiction that Tails had hollow bones like birds to be able to fly, so the same theory could be applied to Dash.
That's fanfic though.
About the Sonic Rainboom, I still think the one Dash pulled off when she was just a foal looked cooler than the one in the flight contest...
Have a swirly day!
what's after this?
Or Pegasi in general
The Numbers, mason!?
flying is magic
He didn't get the letter I guess
I've seen Princess Celestia raise the sun, but when Luna raises the moon, it's a beaut.
One letter away from being a swirly. Or a whorly
this scene makes less sense than... the first half of the movie
http://static.gigwise.com/gallery/2559453_ElvisPresley-Pony.jpg
And Hay, that's why I said it was a theory
Dick's a troll
oh snap

OMG I seriously thought the dog was gonna die
Plus there's the fact that Celestia never has to deal with the clouds since that's the job for the pegasi.
YES
I can't clop to this. I already clopped to the father son bonding
AAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW YYYYYYYEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH

4For years
This is indeed awesome.
Well technically there's not even effort required for turning the sky blue, seeing as that's a natural side effect of light filtering through the atmosphere.
I walked away for 10 minutes. wtf is going on
hi Walken~

He's such a chicken.
Walken is the villan? Coooooooool...
That wouldn't make sense since Dragons and Unicorns seem to be the only ones capable of using magic in Equestria.
you say tomato, I say tomato

yeah, I belive they fly do to magic myself. Just as they can stand on clouds and manipulate weather

the wings are used for control and turning and such (I would assume)

inb4 watch reference
Spike sends Celestia messages with his fire breath, you know that some kind of magic must be involved there.
Dudeguy: did you forget about Spike the magic mailbox?
Damn
Owait
Derp
Is there a certain port I should be connecting on? 6667 isn't working.
0Sol, too late
Ya see that?
fair enough
Ghosties already made one
slammed in the nose, fucks you all up!
at least they weren't brass knuckles

so where were we on the dummy account position?

SUCKER PUNCH
M-mail. Magic mail.
Well

D-Mail.
Synros has said something
CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS INTERROGATORS, YAY!!
this movie is great
I might be reciting fanon with magic flying pegasi, but it would explain away scientific debate.
Razyn has not
Dragon-mail :D

I dunno
:D
Walken's scarf is so fabulous
I don't want to exacerbate the situation too much
The mafia know everything somehow
Like you can find MLP fans watching R rated movies on the net
mt* nvm the "is"
Spike is essentially Twilights' Familiar it seems, besides, aren't dragons always magical in some way?
bronychat.net (173.236.147.3) port 6667
I almost want there to be a kind of twist to the story of the royal sisters, where it turns out that Luna was actually the oldest in the beginning and was jealous because it was her /younger/ sister who was getting all of the attention...it would make the whole banishment thing be brought into a whole new light, and it would still work with Celestia being oldest now because it's been 1000 years with Luna unable to ag

Dumbass
yo sun, fuckhead that he is
I recently started playing that :D
Who said he left it there earlier?
What a derp
every line walken says is gold
understandable, though if we have nothing to go off of we aren't doing either of them a favor
^
Awesome game is awesome.
When me and the girls were goin' to the mountain to get the dragon to sleep somewhere else, I don't know why we didn't bring Spike along, they could've talked, Dragon to dragon, but Fluttershy handled it.
Haha, what a coincidence.
Woulda gotten away with it, if it weren't for that meddling drivers license
Found this plot summary of True Romance: "Clarence marries hooker Alabama, steals cocaine from her pimp, and tries to sell it in Hollywood, while the owners of the coke try to reclaim it."
wow, he is a really good actor. Its a shame his performance wasn't good in that movie.
4Fuck, I found the reference : /
lol
I think he says more than JUST gold, DSNesmith
4Ninja'd
fuckers frickn EVERYWHERE
Needs more Marimba music
This is true
I'm not sure the dragon would have listened to a 'baby' dragon.
I'LL GET YOU YET
BEARS
But keep in mind that we're discussing stuff in Skype at the moment
o.o
I don't really think the dragon would have taken Spike seriously, considering Spike is just a baby/
>Forgets to put irc. at the beginning
I doubt it myself
boo-beep
AJ, didn't Twilight tell you about a certain incident with another dragon when Spike was being jealous of Owloysius?
skype noise
or something
hes so dead
But I guess anything is better than flying in and bucking it in the face.
I was about to mention that one myself.
OW
>_<
boo-blip is the new pink box

"never start with the hand, the victime gets all... fuzzy"

Ohgawd.

Is he trying to make fun of him?

IT'S DAVID PERRY EVERYONE!
Fridge logic
this is so perfect

So in nature, Eggplant > Canteloupe?
I now know how to curse in Italian
True Romance is about truth and love
Radio graffiti is the only station I listen to!
What the hell are we watching anyway?
the most suprising thing about that scene was Walken getting out-hammed by some random dude

THIS SONG KEEPS STALKING ME

Well yeah, he was goin' to kill that dude. It was obvious, indeed...
8Where is the romance?
hey Boegela
4OH
Eggplant. Trollololol. Wasn't expecting something like that
And Spectrum, I didn't notice that the slide didn't pull. Which shot? Or was it all of them?
Finally, I got in
Now...Fluttershy I'll admit, I want to snuggle with at night. AJ is the one I want by my side when it comes time to shake the pecan trees.

Fluttershy like...sets you at mental peace. You have no reason to be upset at her.
you know .. i have no links with him :D
wait, Brad Pitt?
Oh damn, Tarantino filmed this? I would've made an effort to have gotten here earlier.
alumonius the romance is between that guy's skull and the bullet
Killing is romance and friendship is magic
stoned like always

4Here's how I see it, the rules state to not post any suggestive material...I think. We may have changed that particular bit in the rules, so if we did, then my point is moot
Nice Sinatra
Cool car phone bro
Sunday.
you probably missed the intro
dang, the plot lost me
I have a wired phone in my car, bish.
Candlejack never instantly teleported people away in the cartoon.
Dat phonebooth

I hope he does
:3
it's the guy from warehouse 13

oops forgot to shout out to every pony
No, but that's what the Candle Jack meme has evolv-
lol nope, RAWRity, I got picked for lottery once but that's when I was asleep :P
I don't even see it as suggestive.
I wouldn't even say it's suggestive though
doctor Zhivago referencE?!
13I didnt even get the joke at first.
I have a rollercoaster creator for an Ad
kik
OMG it's ARTIE
lol
same
6It really should be relevant to either the movie or the chat though.
13I mean... its very vaguely suggestive, but com'on.
Doctor Zhivago?
SirSprinkles: Yeah, that's what I said
my god I recognize 90% of the people in this movie
Quiet, Bert
why do I keep seeing Artie from WH13 in EVERY MOVIE EVER?
13Relevant I can see.
road rage :3
It's more that it's not relevant.
lol
lol, rage.

Carbro is so alpha
Epic road rage
Because he's amazing?

ROAD F7U12
RAINBOW DASH IS THE BEST PONY,AND IF YOU DISAGREE.....I will love and tolerate that..everybody has his/her opinions.

Awesome multitask driving

Luna's the best
I have a disney world advert :3
>Silverscreen >Not teal text
4But overall, Sprinkles and dari are right regardless because they are not relevant to the movie
Boegela Yeah that's the spirit.
:D
>WHAT IS THIS MADNESS
Or, fear and loathing?
Madness...?
THIS IS EQUESTRIA!
8Not Teal Text
thats right thinking Boegela
lol, then again, it is about a guy and his hooker :P
No, this is Patrick.
IT'S TRUE ROMANCE(?)

dat hamlet reference
Hi Octavia!
Howdy, Octavia.
Hey, Sketchy :)
07lol LunaTheForgotten
Now they think they have a dirty policeman.
Hey everyone
What does it mean being uncut? It's a powder, how can it be cut?
Hello, everypony.
05http://www.timeanddate.com/counters/customcounter.html?msg=Bronyville+Season+One+Marathon&month=09&day=10&year=2011&hour=12&min=00&sec=00&p0=137
Trust me, I know of a way.
4I wonder where Octavia's mind's at?
Poor Mongoose
i didn't know these cops liked shakespeare
13;)
uncut means concentrated
pure shit
SuperBrony64: Uncut as in pure
ooouw...a red tie..kinky
Uncut is best
it means its pure you noob
Outshone by Octavia
"Fucking fuck fuck fucker fuck"
This movie is so clean it should be rated E for everyone.
Oh okay
wut do cops do when they conviscate cocaine?
superbrony it means it's pure cocaine, no filler or anythind added to it
I'd go with Twilight's tough love method, just tie her to the computer chair, tape her eyelids open, and force her to watch the first episode.
: /
ore tanjou
UNCUT>CUT
13Dat seconds counter...
snort it.
Its like Blues Clues but in real life!
Octavia does chat in daily more then I do
Zephirdd: Do ho ho
Herospirit, what did I miss?
He'll wear a wore
I hear in some places it's considered cool to snort a mixture of Cocaine and Gun Powder
he.he.he dirty cops.
wire*
or Pinkamena.. do you have a basement?
Blues Clues FTW
And he's a mod
foreskin is da shiet
also, are we going to get in the never ending penis argument here?
I have a better idea.
Cut cocaine is as low as 10% purity
sniff it, of course. what else would you do with it
So wait, wasn't he the producer? Is he an undercover cop?!
wow they like to use the word fuck alot dont they
Uncut>cut?
KIK
LOL
07did you find the first clue?
"I hate airports... they're so... airporty."
You missed a whole lot of people saying "fuck" Rainbow_Dash
Meanwhile, back in Movie 1
Introduce her to ponies via internet.
uncut cocaine can be up to 90& purity
if you snort cocaine and gunpowder do you explode?
At least its better than living near the train tracks
Cut is what you sell, pure can kill you
Cocaine: give it to the asians.
pinkie pie is the biggest cocaine dealer in all of equestria
:3
Oh, I think I will be just fine in that case
more happy music...
<Bjornfot>: foreskin is da shiet
@Darf, no, it isn't.
She has a youtube account. That's the most I can do for you.
Dat music
after girl is beat up
13Detroit... ewww
Lol.
So cut cocaine can't kill you?
nah, pinkie is all about weed
Quill?
This music.
HErp
and cofee
pinkie pie couldn't deal coke, she'de just do it herself
It just keeps coming back.
pinjas Piknie Pie IS cocaine.
Hey, Octavia.
It's a bag of cocain. what does blue want to do with this?
Just be careful where one wrong click in you're in a Clopping disaster
I love this music
07yep
Gunpowder and Cocaine? So THAT'S what a creeper is made out of!
07the entire movie
cut cocaine can kill you because its still cocaine
PINKIE PIE IS PINK
Lucid: Yeah your right
Detroit's airport's actually pretty nice.
Pinkie Pie bakes cocaine into her cupcakes.
xD
Play this music in Clockwerk Orange
The girl must really like that guy
crap, I'm lost (watches Thundercats)
Better find the other clues first
Do it
gunpowder plus cocaine... anyone else want to watch Lord of War suddenly?
So who here's willing to try to get her to be a Brony?
4testing 1 2
although that movie is hella depressing
Go to canada
Cocaine is bad, mkay.
...is tthat the place Donnie and his friends hung out at in Donnie Darko?
Well her injuries seem to have gotten better, or just don't hurt now.
Hello Mongoose
thats my favorite nicholas cage movie
Honestly, this isn't THAT BAD of a movie.
Lightning.
Well, that shouldn't happen if you direct her to Equestria Daily after she joins the herd.
Ahhhh, brown brown

Cancun is cool
Neither of which is good.
omg shee fukked upp
Movieception?
Dont be dumb and go to canada
ProffesorKritzkrieg colors
its actually pretty much the only cage movie that I like
Pinkie bakes cupcakes with a Dash of Rainbow
Now they've BOTH murdered gangsters! TRUE ROMANCE
This isn't the B movie

DO HO HO
Octavia Wait is auto kick off?

Rainbow Dash: A Special Spicy Liquid Spice she recieved after triyng out the rainbow color in Cloudsdale.
PLEASE no cupcake refrences please.
2,14 It's always on, but it's useful to remind chat that colors are for mods only
13Its two warnings then autokick
4<Boegela>: Pinkie bakes cupcakes with a Dash of Rainbow
tun tun tuuuuum
That was Sergeant Sprinkles.
aw
But think any of you can message her via youtube? Most I can do is give the name.
is the Veemi player looking different in the embedded stream?
4I wonder if either of the trials will mention it
Yeah I was responding to [NLR]molestia
Now thats Rainbow Dash, fellow bronies and Ponies.
(yes he did)
Oh yeah!
!seen Mongoose
Spin: Silly filly, your eyes are all derpy. Mongoose is in the channel.
wait the b is rocky horror
I thought only the mods were allowed to have colors? How does a regular user use color?
oh god
"First thing you need is a cup of Pony, add it to the mix"
Just give her a nice introduction.

Derpy must be mistaken

nobody else auditioned
I can also encourage her to read the message.

Mongoose is not here!
a brony that doesn't know what cupcakes is? That's kinda stretching it
.
: D
He got the part, well there goes that movie's profits
I thought that guy looked familiar. I know it's not him, but he sort of reminds me of Biff
hahaha
bro troll
"Rocky Horror" won't be til about 10:00
4He basically posted the log line
0im starving my self over this movie :3
He didn't even try out. I guess he's that good
That so is overly used in this movie.

Gar....I'll lurk until the movie starts then...
Dat Bob Marley
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED

So, once I give the username, only one of you introduce her to ponies.

How much longer has the movie got? Not that it's a bad movie, I'm just anxious for Ponies

Needs more bullets
Spin: It's actually quite harder than you think.

We're gonna need ponies... lots of ponies.

Dark_Horst, Fallout Equestria?
I'll PM you her username. Just send a message to her giving an introduction to Bronies.
that's easy
Ouch
But she rarely goes on her youtube account.
it's a shit fanfic, period
Fuck it, he's high.
0Sol, what?
i mean, thinks of it! what a twilight could do with a handful of AA12'S
0oh
0those are cops
it's only popular because of the scare factor
oi sumica, sotha you there?
Well, he's dead
Reaver21 what about FoE
>he's so dead
best in the world at what they do
Eliot's screwed
Yes Quill.
What would Twilight need with AA batteries?
Dark_Horst, I like the way you think :D
These are some badass cops
Exactly
It's funny.
Quick question: is Celestia > Notch?
Hey if you hit a any bumps along the way I'll be happy to help
So, I guess you're ready?
The puns are really funny.
Twilight would be decent with an AA12, since it has little recoil.
/me 13still hasn't read Cupcakes
GET IN JAIL! LIKE A BOAS
notch can't raise the sun...
and sumi? RESPOND MAN
I'll message her in a few, I have to go help with something
superbrony64 you DON'T want to know the answer to that question.
FlutterBro, they are the same entity
I still say it's worth it for dem organ puns. :P
magic runs on batteries Superbrony64
CrimsonFoxx: Okay then.
Notch PROGRAMMED the sun and the moon
Sklar, he mentioned Ponies and Combat Shotguns, and I thought of Velvet Remedy :D
ding ding
Twilight could use magic to hold any gun and not have to worry about recoil
and created an infinite world
13Ew lol
therefore notch > celestia
Dat hat
Hmm... I guess I should try to introduce her to ponies myself using my social talent.
Windows is True Romance. =D
0shes already healed?
DIS MUSIC
Okay then
Reaver21 i get it now
fucken music
I love how we go through so much to recruite people
twilight would have ridiculous accuracy
I'm Doctor Roxxo I do cocaine
Once everyone else is gone.
hey dude, you got a head on your hat
But she could only use that gun as much as her knowledge of knowing how to use it.
All I do is
k-k-k--k yeaaa
i love the inconspicuous pinkmobile
"Hey You wanna watch this show?"
Lets ignore all of this violence and listen to some happy music :)
It's like I'm watching a Wiseau film

what is that song or tune?
In case the plot finds us
She can't control the accuracy.
05its ratehr short isnt it?
she should use a colt/

I just have to mod Celestia into Minecraft and then Celestia > Notch
0He's learning

Those boobs... O.O
He's right

I don't think Ponies can use guns…how would they reach the trigger?

DOHOHO
Dr Rockso is gonna make you a balloon bass!
Flutterbro, DO EET.
rainbow dash would suck at sniping, she'd be more of a shotgun type... twilight, aj probably both have patience for sniping, fluttershy the best?
Her boobs are jello. :0

"You didn't like it? cool"

"You liked it ? cool"
Special pony adapted firearms?
that awkardness

Fluttershy is Mortar Team?
Pretty short, yeah.
>magic
eliot's panicking
I would explain how most ponies would use guns, but I feel too lazy, and I'm watching a movie.
but fluttershy would never kill anything... I wonder how good rarity's aim is
yeah herospirit, I like it when she walks
OH WAIT I GET IT
Is that the answer to every question Molestia?
oh shit
Eliot was the guy who auditioned for the part that Clarence's retard friend got
Ponies with guns? ponies don't need guns silly...
He knows everything
I was surprised when I told my Mom I was a Brony that she instantly knew what I was talking about. She didn't care at all, and even got herself a Trixie shirt when I got my DJ P0N3 shirt ha. =)
At least not in Equestria.
Spoiler: rocks fall in and everyone dies
ForeverOdin: LUCKY!
wait your mom knew what you were talking about?
Yes I do think your stupid

Can anyone here make models for minecraft? I need to mod ponies
dude. your mom is best poyn

Cops: U MAD?
If you do read it make sure you get the updated version with fixed grammar/spelling.
Clarince, you are the....oh, you were rhetorical
Like I said just ask her to watch it with you and let her form her own opinion let her know its what you like and as a mother she should be supporting you.
Remember, there are modern soldier ponies than Equestia normal guard ponies.
Apparently the original was terrible.
these cops aint even mad
Spin: You have a point.
Cops are lawling all the way

Ohgawd
When did Clarince become a fucking mob boss?
