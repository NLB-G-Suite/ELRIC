I remember dis one
oooh this episode
NINJA MONKS
Sometimes when I work on projects that involve some form of programming, I totally get caught up in them and lose track of time myself... Although lately I limit myself from doing such things in the evening/night time, because it seems that's the time I'm most prone to losing track of time...
^
No no no.
yes
Those are Monk Ninjas.
hai CrazyHippie
oh, that one is nice
HAI Michael
The random monks that don't feature at all in the rest of the ep

Python is okay
Dr. Who?
Mounties vs Monks
Bad game.
Oh... My bad.
Yes donutpop365
monks are screwed
I hate how it cares about whitespace though...
Ah, okay, wouldn't know, not a Whovian...

MadSurge: timmy turner?
toby tuner
That man needs a dentist.
Barbetos|AtWork: Who doesnt like Doctor Who?
Crab People.
i don't know
I like the lobster people better
I really wanted to do php for the group project we're doing this semester
But the professor is a RoR fanboy
php is fast and easy. its not elegant, but its got massive support.
So I'm just doing other php stuff on the side
its been around forever.
the shell fish people ar cool thought
I tire of nakedness.
Just drop it Rose
suddenly i crave steak
Great now I have the same craving
i crave pasta
Stop making me hungry!
I crave the blood of a virgin....I mean pasta.
....
whatever it is these british folks put in their tea, it must be hardcore
oooooooK?
CrazyHippie: how does saying steak make you hungry?
steak and fries
Bronysith: I didn't eat lunch yet :(
or a steak and baked potato
bloody jucy tender steak
there
ahaha
medium rare steak is best
You can format your php code to look nice though and make it easy to read.
^
medium well is best
i also enjoy taking fries, adding pulled pork ontop of that with shredded cheese and ranch dressing
mine's probably awful
i can't eat steak it's too rought
I really have no plan or anything, I just write as I go along
HA
I have become partial to the codeigniter framework
Beef glorious BEEF
its a framework for php web apps that doesnt get in your way.
MVC style
but flexible.
and bison
bison meat is awesome
hm, interesting
bison....what!?
and you can put php code anywhere you want, its not restrictive.
and dog
no eating natives
where do you get bison?
and no stupid templating crap
there now I'm not hjungry anymore
where do you live
I had an IRC bot that I coded myself... The code for it was pretty messy if I recall correctly...
i aint telling you shit
so its super fast, because its just executing php and not wasting cycles on a templating engine
Earth what about you?
I coded an irc bot framework in php
yea i live on earth
Bison is great meat though
it was like 60% done, it just needs some polish
Oh, cool!
i live in equestria
alrighty then
I'll try Bison one day
RAW
I could give you a copy if you wanted to look at it or improve it
have fun

I actually did something quite funny a few weeks ago
dis dude be trippin
I took 4 years worth of irc chatlogs from #laserchat on ecnet

and created a bot that would respond what typical responses were for questions asked in those 4 years
and it's awsome

This ep as so much foreshadowing
Bad wolf, Torchwood
oh yeah, that'd hilarious
I dont' like the way he acts in general no but he is still entertaining lol

cursed diemonds
I have a tendency to stop playing RPGs just before the end... I like to call it the RPG curse... I'll keep playing until very close to the ending, and then suddenly something takes my attention from it and I never finish it.

rpgs have a hard time keeping me engaged.
lately I've been playing through games in the Tales of series with a group of friends, but we don't get to play very often since we all have to be available at the same time

Torchwood is an anagram of Doctor Who

Why do I always have neighbors who like loud rap music no matter where I live?

-__-
NewSuperBronyU: Its a tie between Magic.mov and Shed.mov for me :P
AJIsAwesome: it's fat bronies discussing how srs bzns are pony toys. And a little girl looks at them weirdly
.........
I used to have neighbors like that where I used to live... It was SOOOOO annoying.
oni_link: Magic.mov is fine too
That's.....interesting. :S
AJIsAwesome: yeah :I

Matt Smith is just a figment of imaginations based on my hatred for terrible actors.
twilight_sprinkle: Is that a channel I see? :P
11,01My favorite interview is still Ask Pegasus Lola mod.
I have really sketchy neighbors too :p
AJIsAwesome: nuuuu >_>
Wait, let me correct that: Matt Smith is a figment of my imagination, built from my hatred for terrible actors.
Nittany_Discord, I don't think we've seen it yet

00,03DON"T SPOIL IT Nittany_Discord !!!

11,01He's great at L4D2.
What's this? And, hi! :)
Hello Amelia
hoi Amelia
Actually
Hi Amelia
do tell
I prefer to wear pajamas versus old t-shirts. I find it more comfortable for me when I sleep.
ello Amelia
like I'm talking from 10 years ago
CrimsonPhoenix: i'm not. link me to it
what EXACTLY do you mean by comment page
Amelia: ello
NENUDJUS: but how, exclamation points dont have..organs..do they?
cause I don't think it's needed since there's a comment section for each picture
BELOW
twilight_sprinkle: some things... you dont wana know
Hello.
Hello Weeping
NENUDJUS: o_o
I have quite a few old hand-me-downs from my older sister.
CrimsonPhoenix: what do you mean, what do i mean? comment page is a page that lists images with their recent comments, sorting them by newest top
Hi.
I don't have an older sibling. YES
Sometimes I wish I had an older sister to give me free clothes
CrimsonPhoenix: no, not that
hiya guys I'm back
and chat is dead
so very dead
Hi, otakon. :)
Ohai otakon
CrimsonPhoenix: dont tellm me you've never seen a comment page before
00,03because you arrived, otakon. Way to go. You killed everyone.
I will never ever ever fit in my little sister's stuff
...
lol
Not that she needs any more clothes...
........
well for one I couldn't care less for comment
The problem I have is that they often don't fit my style. They're still nice, but it's definitely not something I'd buy for myself. XD
ELLO EVERYPONY IM FINALY BACK HOME IN THE GOOD OLD UK
Hi, Dj_Cyber-4G. :)
Hello Dj_Cyber-4G
Hi Dj_Cyber-4G
CrimsonPhoenix: that'S the problem with derpibooru. imageboards are pretty dead without these pages
and two Derpibooru still is sort of new and uninformed
00,03Hey Dj_Cyber-4G, I'm realy happy for you and imma let you finish, but Billy Mayes was the best caps user of all time! OF ALL TIME!
Well Dark_Horst it's meant to archive pictures for me, not really to discuss
yeah haha
wut?
Scoot-Scootaloo: :D
CrimsonPhoenix: but that'S what imageboards do. that'S what the name booru stands for
:D
*collapses in exhaustion* wassszup indernez?
Dark_Horst: be a better person, use bronibooru :D
Scoot iz mah fwend o3o
Dark_Horst, again Derpibooru is quite uninformed really

MadSurge: also, never heard of bronibooru before
Dark_Horst: no risk in running on creepy porn/creepy comments, only bloodless creepy :D
lol
Dark_Horst: it's the Ponygoons booru
ONLY 23 HOURS AND 58 MINUTES!!! ~yay~
madpfff, where's the fun in that?
MadSurge: ping ^
I still wear them. Mostly at home though, because I prefer to go out in something more my style.
11,01You'll live RDash5000.
ok twilight_sprinkle i have the math for your question!
Nittany_Discord: of course i will! how else will i be able to watch season 3?
omg wait who is streaming
i miss ponibooru. they just didnt give a fuck
Dark_Horst: I like not running into disgusting stuff :(
NENUDJUS: O_o ok, lets see it
MadSurge: you know what a filter is for, right?
twilight_sprinkle: ∀x : ∃y ≥ x : P(y) f(x) x ∀y : ∃x : f(x) ≥ y(log(x)) if f ∘ g1 = f ∘ g2 implies g1 = g2 for all morphisms g1, g2 : x → a. if g1 ∘ f = g2 ∘ f implies g1 = g2 for all morphisms g1, g2 : b → x f : x → y and g : y → z, F(g ∘ f) = F(g) ∘ F(f) f : X → Y in C, we have ηY ∘ F(f) = G(f) ∘ ηX;
......
thats how it is done
Dem Cheats wall
Yeah I just wear pajamas at home usually, and if I go out I just throw a pair of jeans on
Nvm
dose that help?
MadSurge: actually, derpibooru fidlers about EVRYTHING remotely not absolutely childfriendly on default setting
I LOVE ADVENTURE TIME!
*filters
it's HILARIOUS
NENUDJUS: one sec, i need to analyze it..
SPanish? :D
twilight_sprinkle: ok
*looks up spanish mlp*
NENUDJUS: BRAIN HAS MELTED
XD
/me looks up spanish adventure time
/me looks up spanish
11,01NENUDJUS: For each x, there exists a y greater than or equal to X such that P(y)f(x) = x. For each y, there exists and X such that f of x is greater than or equal to y times logarithm x.
11,01And so on...
/me rotfls
Dark_Horst: the creepy images I find on there don't look too childfriendly :D
i know this math
easy
00,03Que estan hablando ahora...
AAAHHHH MATH!!!!!!!
MadSurge: you concept of creepy confuses me
Scoot-Scootaloo: quien sabe
im helping twilight_sprinkle understand how "!" can "bang"
11,01Scoot-Scootaloo: That is something now.
and I sometimes do my hair, but most of the time I'm lazy and I'll just put a hat on :P
11,01I forget what hablar translates to.
00,03talking
Nittany_Discord: speak
or talk
11,01Ahh. To speak.
yeah.... not today
00,03Pero que te pasa, hombre? No sabes como traducir el inglis de espanol?
00,03ingles*
MadSurge: sides, nothing wrong with a little nsfw. why, i remember once stumbling upon a beautifully drawn image of luna in a bathtub, wet mane and all, back and behind just above the water in rather indecent display
spanich is weird
no hablo espanol
Dark_Horst: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/5c18e4474be5e83ec7fddc2a8c44c07d.jpg how about this?
yes spanich
Even when I'm just going out for regular shopping, I'd rather look nice than just throw something on and go.
Dj_Cyber-4G: U ARE WEIRD :[
hi everypony :)
MadSurge: pff, that'S not creepy, that's amusing xD
Holla cachi01
Hi, cachi01. :)
Dj_Cyber-4G: im just kidding :3

AJIsAwesome:
cachi01:
MadSurge: i probably dont, but find me something that an faze me, i dare you
Oh wait. Nvm. :D
RDash5000:
*can
Yeah if I'm going to try on clothes and stuff I put nicer clothes on, but if I'm just quickly going somewhere I'll just kinda half ass it
but I'm usually too lazy to put on makeup or spend more than 5 minutes on my hair
that attitude seems legit
And I hate shopping
Dark_Horst: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/7fdce0ef613bc2bb1519f434e5df5ea0.gif so lovely <3

He was here a couple hours ago.
MadSurge: Dios mio!!
i havn't seen him in a while
MadSurge: yeah thats. uhmmm cute
I guess I'm like the most common size ever so all the stuff I like is never in my size
Atleast the stores were air conditioned
i think there was a video of that once
Shoe shopping is the worst
I love shopping personally. Even if it's just groceries or something, I enjoy going out to shop. XD
I actually do like shopping if I'm not planning on buying anything :P
well thats not how u spell pinkie pie
Dark_Horst: I'm afraid you're the unique one here :D
Indeed thats not how you spell pinkie pie :D
yeah, that's jackarunda's job
I hate spending money
Shoes are a pain... My feet are big. x-x
MadSurge jesus thats horryfing
Mine are oddly shaped and stick out in the back
MadSurge: i survived 4chan B)

Meh. I never did like Molestia.
Yeah it's getting cold here too
Clothing isn't so bad because I can usually find stuff I like in my size... But shoes are a pain to find in my size.
aw, that sucks
and look, that day i actually found something new there
MadSurge: D'aww
It's actually been warm enough to need air conditioning here. X-X
brb
Oh Scoot-Scootaloo, u so silly.

It's been freezing in my house
GOOBYE
Bye RDash5000
i mean what's the fucking point of an account if you cant fave anyting???
AJIsAwesome: wat? im not leaving
Apparently those neighbors I was complaining about earlier have control of the heat in our building
Know what I wish? Being able to save comments on Youtube. I've seen very inspirational comments on youtube.
they still haven't turned it on yet =/
Chickens get plastic.
I'd rather it be colder... I love cool weather... Not like winter cold, but autumn cold is nice.
AJIsAwesome: screencap :)

An OS is going to take more work than just a language. We'd need a kernel for an OS.
cachi01: I would give all my money as well :D
what does object oriented mean
Methinks this, too, is a hoax
BRB im going to blockbuster to rent RE6 lol
Phase4: Either one would do :P
:D
cachi01: let me know how that goes i want to try that game out
lol
:D
good luck cachi01

The really sad thing about Bill Cosby is that after everything he did and all the laughter he brought to generations of children, the only thing that modern audiences can remember about him is a bunch of idiocy that an impersonator put into his mouth for Family Guy.

I prefer The Original above all, but GX wasn't that bad
taoumi: how is the progress?
CriticKitten: totally
Bitches got nothing on Maxamillion Pegasus.

NewSuperBronyU also, how is it?
I kinda like the Volcano line stuff from Taco Bell. I swear, I almost passed out the first time I had the Volcano Nachos
National Taco Day is a lie

I suppose if we want to be realistic and varied in our planetary binome settings, there should be planets of any kind that NASA has discovered. Including planets of less or more gravity, planets of poisonous or no atmosphere, and even gas giants.

So, I know I asked this before, but did we not already watch this?
kandarihu: i agree XD
giveasmilegetasmile: A tip: If you wanted to talk to someone directly, type part of their name in and push tab. It'll autocomplete. :)
It took me way to long to figure that out
Eddmario: Nope. I'm idling on TF2.
twilight_sprinkle: The one-dimensional logistic map defined by x → 4 x (1 – x) is one of the simplest systems with density of periodic orbits. For example, → → (or approximately 0.3454915 → 0.9045085 → 0.3454915) is an (unstable) orbit of period 2, and similar orbits exist for periods 4, 8, 16, etc.

YAY!
otakon: if you ask nicely, he MAY play Kirby epic yarn, that's what you want him to play, right? :3
THOUSAND YEAR DOOR!
I love this intro
just sayin'
SUPER PAPER MARIO
dat ttyd
Zuxxez123: no it's the 20th Anniversary Kirby collection
. . . and it's skipped
KNEW IT!
NewSuperBronyU. But I wub Kirby :'(
oh ma gawd
Original Paper Mario was better
cool, now i dont have to play this game XD
Lunar_Brony: He heard how muched you liked it, and being the spiteful god among men he is, skipped it.
also NewSuperBronyU , Y U no like Kirby? :<
lol
Zuxxez123 FFFUUUUUUU-
Our origional ol' friend, Mario! Welcome back :D
Dark92Enigma: it wasn't a random brony it was an actress
Kirby is best main 6
COMBAT!
JUMP!
Nashville: My original ol' friend is white plank on the left in pong.
Dark92Enigma-:Worse. It was a couple of actors pretending to be some sort of weird parody of bronies.
okay, that's it. Meanwhile, you're title of The World's Tactless Man is being revoked and transferred over to NewSuperBronyU.
TAKE THAT KOOPA DOWN TO LEVEL!
QUICK! USE HYPER BEAM
Lunar_Brony: your*
They claim not to be actor
CCCP: Indeed :3 hes second best pink thing
STFU
actors*
kill dat funny turtle?
Wirisme: They don't want to ruin the illusion.
Wirisme: I thought someone here said that they admitted they were actors afterward.
Who streaming?
Wirisme: That and they probably were paid to stay in character until a certain time.
Nashville: NewSuperBronyU is
oni_link ^^
But yeah they seemed exactly like if someone didn't really know anything about bronies and tried to make up something
Brb :3
BINGO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
that's plausible
Wirisme: They sure as hell weren't acting like any bronies I've ever seen at conventions.
nice!
Bingo, you gained...nothing.
should have multi jumped :P
Wirisme: exactly it was staged
NewSuperBronyU, didn't you have rhythm practice beforehand? :S
Meanwhile: It's the thought of winning that counts. :P
DocSane: i'm speechless......i mean how mean-spirited can they be?
damn only 4 points?
for all that?
still watching that oh god oh man video lol
Dark92Enigma: you'd be suprised
Let's see what happens
Zuxxez123: It's not whether you win or lose, unless you win, then that's totally what it is.
Lol :D
Meanwhile: Wise words my friend.
I didn't bring it up :)
Wirisme try getting 3 Shine Sprites, which gives you max everything, AND do it in the middle of a boss fight when your entire party is KO'd, you have 1 health, 0 FP and 0 SP.
Hi CrazyHippie
Well yeah I did originally
hey
Dark92Enigma- : Springer deals in freak shows. No real bronies took him up, so he had to fake a couple.
Hi CCCP
hi CrazyHippie
I feel i should play this game. I beat the first one and then skipped all the way to Super Paper Mario, and I'm not too fond of that one, I like this style better
I dont think it was staged. I think it was more likely that the people were just fans of the show, and not actual bronies
Hi thelonepony
DocSane well duh
Thousand year door.?
god I have to eat, later everybody
Hi
oops
Hello there CrazyHippie
BYe
hi Crystaline_Shard. Eeyup :D
11,02This is the best Paper Mario game imo
Bye TheKatPony
Cya TheKatPony
Ello Zuxxez123
Yeah, this is a fun one.
^^^^
Bye TheKatPony
NewSuperBronyU: Agreed.
11,02Later TheKatPony :)
bye TheKatPony
/me Huggles dat NewSuperBronyU
Personally, I think the best Paper Mario is the best
seeya TheKatPony
bye TheKatPony
NewSuperBronyU: superpapermario is better
I think NewSuperBronyU should mic up again. :3
It's too bad, though; I have to be leaving right now.
[SWAG]Haku: The dude in the pink dress and tuxedo just didn't seem like he was for real.
Some of the stuff they said was pretty accurate as I remember
seeya Polydunami
aw bye Polydunami
And the best is the original
Bye Polydunami
bye Polydunami
Yeah that... "cosplay"...
for N64
WE DON'T NEED NO STINKING POW BLOCK
Bye Polydunami
Oh wow, didn't expect so many farewells
Wirisme: They said nothing that couldn't be gleaned from an hour's prep on Wikipedia.
Are we STILL talking about this? :S
i feel stupid asking bout the spinger late
Why not Polydunami it's how we work!
Theres gonna be a 3DS one right?
True DocSane
oh OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Crystaline_Shard it's all a matter of opinion, and the two games have radically different playing styles.
aww
his father?
the springer show*
yikes
:'(
His father is deeeeeaaaaaad.
oni_link eeyup, and I'm gonna get it!
You've integrated well, Zuxxez123 :3
superretroworld: it's okay. :3 Everyone here will gladly give their two cents. :P
wow

BYE Polydunami :)
Lunar_Brony: nope SPM is better :D

damn that's kind of dark
Lunar_Brony: Me too !!!!
Yay! Intergration!
Ci wish I could view stream
Zuxxez123: :)
"Oh no, my dad is dead! Wait, nevermind, he has some paper."
crickets?
cricket!!
otakon: Another reason why I love this game.
DocSane: I get it......still awkward
AJIsAwesome|Busy: indeed
Yeah, Hooktail is not too fond of cricket.
NO MERCY MARIO
oh my god I had a dream about this
Kolorado
damn
Pfft.
Crystaline_Shard I prefer Thousand Year Door, but if you like Super Paper Mario more, that's cool too. I like it, but it ain't my favourite.
CrazyHippie: youre living up to your name, jk :D
Poor Kolorado
otakon: IKR? :S
You fail at recognising the remains of your dad.
hi
well at least it isn't his dead
true
Meanwhile: would you recognize the bones of your dead dad?
dat dry bones
/me makes you feel the power of FORCED PERSPECTIVE
Should we stop talking about Springer now?
[SWAG]Haku: that was Kolorado?? The explorer from the first one?? :o
Meanwhile: *recognizing
ZOMBIES!
No, it was his dad
Should have used a cricket bat against Hooktail :P
oh
LOVE this music here.
oni_link: I was gonna get you for that. But I was too...far out
KEEP HAMMERING!
NewSuperBronyU: trying to get every tattle? :3
otakon: Probably, the old git's missing his teeth and his jaw has serious scarring.
CrazyHippie: YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! :D
ahaha
Meanwhile: I know right? I mean COME ON! You should be able to recoginze the rotting remains of a loved one...
I'M GOING TO TATTLE THE FUCK OUT OF YOU
My people have returned for me! . . . wait, those are Dry Bones . . .
AJIsAwesome|Busy: No that's the yankee (wrong) way of doing it.
shit
Right, I'll be back later. I'm out of here.
seeya pol-
Cya Poly
Bye again poly- oh he's gone
Zuxxez123: I have the right to say so, since I have.
TAKE OUT THE DRY BONES FIRST NewSuperBronyU
I didn't get to say good-bye again
Meanwhile: Yankee? Gee, that's a bit harsh.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: So's your face.
welp they're dead
inb4 ded
otakon hwo about the Red Bones
Zombie_Brony: that's who I meant
Meanwhile: How can you know if you haven't seen it? :P
use a POW block
and Koops
AJIsAwesome|Busy: The power of intuition!
Arent Dry Bones like... seriously weak against fire?
Koops is your best friend here
USE IT!
use it!
Why is Europe so awesome?
Meanwhile: SEEMS LEGIT :P
USE IT DAMMIT!
USE IT!!!!
Meanwhile: Your power is strong... Maybe too much so.
SB, what are you doing?
Europe*
NOW HEAL MARIO!
NewSuperBronyU: HEAL MARIO!

That and muffins.
I need to buy this game :0
/me believes NewSuperBronyU might die on the boss
:3
Barbetos: That is one of my favorite tumblrs
I've got stuff to do, but I shouldn't be too long.
NewSuperBronyU: you seriously need to level up a bit I think man and USE ANOTHER POW BLOCK
I'll be back . . .
oops
Barbetos: derpys smart for once
the hell was that?

there we go
I'll be back . . .

SB, MULTIBOUNCE!!!!!
Return soon Lunar_Brony|AFK
oni_link: it won't hit all of them at once
11,02oni_link: They have a defense of 1, won't do anything :/
I have a question
oh. i knew that o.o (not really)
11,02Or wait...maybe it would...
yeah bounce only does 1 damage
NewSuperBronyU: you gotta JUMP on him!
11,02I think it does 2 damage ><
is it me, or does the female outlander in T2 sound kinda like Raven? :)
NewSuperBronyU: still the point is you're kind of weak it seems
NewSuperBronyU: have you beat the 100 pit trials on other saved file?
Ryunosuke: T2?
What game is play? Ii can't see stream :(
torchlight 2
Playing*
/me comes back a sees Mario.
Ryunosuke: also that's Grey DeLisle so probably
CCCP: Paper Mario
/me procedes to lick NewSuperBronyU :3
CCCP: Paper Mario: 1000 year door.
/me is licked :3
NewSuperBronyU: Hammer does 2 in one attack. Jump does 1 for both 2 attacks.
CCCP: Paper Mario the Thousand YEar Door
ah
I love this game!
you dunno where that pony been!
I wish I had this game
NewSuperBronyU: My opinion: Go with the hammer.
I LOVE the Paper Mario series
^
and the Superstar Saga series
^
I thought multi bounce acted the same as in the first game where you bounce on enemy after enemy until you miss hitting the A button. o.o
DEFINITELY.
some of the BEST RPG's I've ever played
wat
They're botth great series
they need to do a SuperStar HD release
Oh, mario
same here AJIsAwesome|Busy although Ive only played the first Superstar Saga
/me can guess why he was pinged
ESPECIALLY Bowser's Inside Story
GREAT final boss music and fight
oni_link: You're fine with just playing the first one. Skip the second, recommend the third.
otakon: how bout super mario rpg?
otakon: You fight the secret boss yet?
superretroworld: also great
AJIsAwesome|Busy: was the third one bowsers inside story?
oni_link: Yep. :)
partners in time <3
DeathStar: hey sup
AJIsAwesome|Busy: in Bowser's? No I wasn't good enough :(
AJIsAwesome|Busy: yea I need to play that one >.<
AJIsAwesome|Busy: I sold it long ago
otakon: WHAT? :O
im pretty good at the mario rpgs and earthbound, but im terrible at the square soft rpgs
AJIsAwesome|Busy: I.WASN'T.GOOD.ENOUGH.TO.GET.TO.HIM.
superretroworld: Why? Square Soft games are more or less grinder games.
/me hasnt touched Super Mario RPG
Hehe, otakon sucks.
otakon: Don't say that. You could've practiced. :(
oni_link: Me neither, no worries.
NewSuperBronyU: you missed a door
superretroworld: you do realize SMRPG IS a Square game right?
twilight_sprinkle: WELL im going now cya
superretroworld, am I ready to assume you played the superstar saga?
/me sighs in relief

DeathStar: :)
Press B at the right timing and you counter
^
Cackletta was a great boss
the timing is tighter than the block though
CrimsonPhoenix: Pressing B instead allows you to completely negate damage and sometimes deal damage back.
DeathStar: Grammar*
WAIT
CrimsonPhoenix: Sorry.
CrimsonPhoenix: as it should be. :3
CrimsonPhoenix: Meant for NewSuperBronyU.
AJIsAwesome|Busy, by sometime you mean with every physical attacks
AJIsAwesome|Busy: :D That opps. :P

Hello Calcos323
>Not getting the sound badge
oh good lord
Man, I haven't played this in YEARS!!!
dem spikes
I wonder if I still remember where to get everything?
/me cues indiana jones music
lol
Oh no, don't become a Jil... Mario Sandwich!
COOL SCENE!
is this NewSuperBronyU's first playthrough?
nope
Seems like it
Nope
11,02This is my third play through.
Oh
Oof that was close
Beat it twic.
NewSuperBronyU: ah
*twice
Too close
You were almost a Jill Sandwhich
we need bob-oms
had 25 seconds to spare
This would probably be my 13th playthrough if it were me. I adored this game back in the day
the bucking 100 pit trials man :|
third playthrough and still missing secrets :/ you bring shame to all gamers :(
oni_link: no in TTYD
CrimsonPhoenix: oh you
Crystaline_Shard: I
lolololol
just had to
Crystaline_Shard: I am not ashamed. Saddened, but not ashamed. :3
seems legit
CrimsonPhoenix: I dont blame you XD perfect moment
not much of a curse if you ask me
Fools, you have once again opened the box of unintentional helping.
DUN DUN DUUUUUUN
Happens another 2 times, too
lol
Meanwhile: lol
Calcos323: Spoilers
sooo... who can guess what this is referecning? http://derpiboo.ru/113048?scope=scpe6938c7b6f33c4941074d7e7a9211e11cccf895f3
otakon! Haven't seen you in a while
I love nintendo curses. :D You will now hold double the magic bwahahaha, that is if thats okay :D
CrazyHippie: Eh, not really. You figure out that this'll happen more times after the second one
The most cursed curse that ever did curse
Calcos323: I wasnt serious...
love the yoshi sound fx badge <3
CrazyHippie: Sorry. I take all text literally unless it's very clearly indicated sarcasm. One of my many faults
memory card. you dont touch it
NewSuperBronyU: Uses his mallet like I use my crowbar in Hoof-Life 2
Never touch the memory card.
For it is sacred.
Calcos323: No problem. It happened to me this afternoon while watching Doctor Who here
HIT ALL THE THINGS
Calcos323: Naw, it's the internet, Sarcasm is hard to read. Lol. Unless followed by a :P or variation.
^
Dark_Horst: only when mantis is reading it.
Zuxxez123: Touche
I prefer </sarcasm>
Still, we can all agree that I am crazy hype over this game right now
did you say my name?
One of the only Turn-Based RPGs I can enjoy
Calcos323: Yes dear friend, you are hyped for this tremendous game. :D
TBRPG is best RPG
as much as i loved 64, this one is the best paper mario
(Tremendous game I have never played)
11,02^
Hype is srs biz Zuxxez123
/me hasent played through SPM fully
the 64 one was my favorite
I still question how a fat midget plumber on shrooms manages to save anything.
I touched the memory card once; it deleted the entire save. That was the day I realized that old saves are cast into
Oblivion before new ones are made
Good catch on the Star Piece
Meanwhile: happy conincidences.
i want to see how Sticker Star is going to turn out
whats with all the memory card talk? o.o
Also, is it a rule that I'm not allowed to help NewSuperBronyU if he misses a secret?
I wanted to make a permenant savegame so I could replay a specific battle
I still have the memory cards from my PS2 somewhere.
No rules like that.
dat rebuild
he just ignores people when they try to help XD
oh
great now you have 3 to kill
I still have GOD OF WAR 1 and 2 for ps2
Meanwhile: I have 3 of them on my desk right now. Want one? :D
Stallion_of_War: I used to do that all the time in Kingdom Hearts I and II
11,02I don't mind help, but I've played this game before ><
/me </namesake>
This game is more interesting when listening to the pillows.
Zuxxez123: Not unless they've got better completion than my Crash Bandicoot saves.
oni_link: KHII Sephiroth battle, Sephiroth battle over and over.
Stallion_of_War: OMG yes you read my mind
NewSuperBronyU: Oh, I understand that, but even after 13-14 playthroughs, I'm STILL missing stuff
NewSuperBronyU: just no spoilers right? even though you have played through it
11,02No spoilers for the sake of the chat :)
Meanwhile: Alas, I don't have full completetion on the CB games on my cards, I'm ashamed...

I should get that again; I haven't played in at least 3 years
Of course no story spoilers, I was just wondering about secrets
Spoilers, Bowser kidnaps the Princess.

NewSuperBronyU: And this is your 3rd playthrough? lol

Zuxxez123: I thought it was symbolic, not literal.. this was back when i was a kid, mind you
NewSuperBronyU: Yes you can! If you do that, you can actually reflect damage onto your attacker, but the timing is more strict
NewSuperBronyU....i must wub apon you for playing this..

She wants her pipes to get... you know what? This is mario. I am not even going there.
ColeTheHedgehog: No, they're just not open except on movie night
But I thought it.
Oh.
You will ahve to just deal with it.
Barbetos: oh stop pussying out
Shine Sprites! oh wait wrong game.

Stallion_of_War: And that's why one must stay awake and get into that mane chat like camping out for a movie. :3
Thank you, Stallion_of_War.
Zess T was alot nicer in 64 :|

CrimsonPhoenix: That nostalgia hit...
CrimsonPhoenix: i love that book when i was a kid
I rather liked Partners in Time and the one with the bean people, although eventually I got so good and overpowered I could defete Shroomqueen's first form in like, 4 moves
That book...
max
CrimsonPhoenix: I dont recall that book
multi clone jump
and now one jsut for the d'aw of it http://derpiboo.ru/112663
CrimsonPhoenix: The memories...
nostalgia bomb was a success sir
BINGO
Not for me.
I might be a bit slow to talk, I'm watching videos :3
never read it,
NOW GIMMIE MAH 50 BUCKS
there's a secret for those bingos

Replace one letter in that word with another letter in the alphabet and you will guess my name
you know
CrimsonPhoenix: http://bit.ly/SVw94R
Stallion_of_War: the best thing about that pic is that she probably mugged diamond tiara for that thing
this game is doable without upgrading your health
Well assuming oyu get the right letter anyways
(\
Spooky ghost.
Stallion_of_War: best thing ever
I enjoyed watching Playthrough of BP run

Goodbye bronystate
Don't forget the Sound FX badge! I did once, and it wasn't pretty
Bye again DoctoDoctorWho
see yall tomorrow
Bye DoctorDoctorWho!
night DoctoDoctorWho
Calcos323, you can do it
night DoctoDoctorWho
it's a challenge
Bye DoctoDoctorWho
Night DoctoDoctorWho
a bit hard but I know you can do it
i miss ponibooru. but i said that already
I need a picture of Discord complementing Loki on his horned helmate, preferably with Loki replaying that Ironman made fun of it.
Night, DoctoDoctorWho :)
CrimsonPhoenix: You can, but it's unneeded challenge
Go up, room full of corpses; nothing strange here.
/me points furiously at the female goomba "It still lives NewSuperBronyU !!"
unneeded or not some people still enjoy it
11,02Barbetos: :P
I'm changing my bronystate name into my nickname
her brony state user
Its so DASTARDLY
That's something I've never understood, CrimsonPhoenix
what a plot twist
Barbetos: that was a horrible show
Nope
BP NewSuperBronyU
BP
always.....shit
Crystaline_Shard Would you be surprised if I said I had never seen it?
I agree, BP is the way to go until around 18-21
Then you can relax a bit
Calcos323, people invent challenges cause they want some spice in their gameplay
like nuzlock
It's nice how they just stand there and wait for you to kill them.
nuzlocke**
in the first one, didnt they punish raising the same stat, or was that Superstar Saga
Then that's the point where they should move on to another game
Stallion_of_War: it's a very polite battle of strength.
oni_link, only in superstar
Calcos323, what if they still enjoy that game
Reminds me of olde-tyme wars, with olde-tyme standing in lines getting shot.
it's just another way to enjoy said game
ah thanks CrimsonPhoenix also, I do the nuzlocke challenge but in the original Red and Blue only
when did they make Mario turn based combat?
CromsonPhoenix: If they still enjoy it, then why are they inventing artificial difficulty?
Applechip, a long time ago
NewSuperBronyU: your badge
/me I say good sir, would you very much mind standing in a line whilst my fellows shoot at yours?
There's no point to if it's still fun
Calcos323, cause they feel like it
/me Not at all my sir, not at all
CromsonPhoenix: ...I don't get it
Stallion_of_War: Those were the days, now they use cover and don't wear bright red everywhere the go. Pfft....
It started with Super Mario RPG for the Super Nintendo
Cromson.
it's like doing some recipe but changing some stuff
Wow, I can't type
it's a new way to play
If you want something new, why not just switch games?
Calcos323: Type Cri then hit tab, should auto type his name.
I tend to stand out in the open and shoot the crap out of everything.
/me drinks Cranberry_Scotch
Stallion_of_War: We are creatures of manners and courtesy. We wait our turn and take what is coming to us. And if you best us, then by all means my good chum, proceed. :D
...
Calcos323, why do you need to switch games?
Zuxxez123: That's awesome. I've been here for months and never knew that
Stallion_of_War: The Rambo approach, a calculated risk, but very stylish.
you're making the argument go round
it's a bit annoying
Crystaline_Shard: *Dies*
CrimsonPhoenix: Because the one you're playing is clearly getting boring if you need to do that to keep enjoying it
/me flops over wasted.
I love that lucky sound effect ^.^
Also by doing that you save money
CrimsonPhoenix: Sorry if it's getting repetitive, I'm just trying to understand
and you can still enjoy your game in a new way
don't touch the POWER button
/me dat POWER
EVER
CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAp
Alright, I can see that, but there's 10,000,000 free games you can play online
don't touch it HIT IT WITH A BASEBALLBAT!
You have so many options
payper dragoon
It's also a sense of self-accomplishment
So THAT'S were the dragon flew off to after Fluttershy chased hiim away.
lol
what?
TATTLE TIME!
Calcos323, you sound like those casual gamer actually
Actually, the dragon was chased out of this tower to Equestria
/me throws otakon at Cranberry_Scotch
CrimsonPhoenix: Alright, I think I get it. I'd never do that myself, I find it a waste of time, but I understand. Thank you
/me dodges mid air
crickets
YOU DIDN'T GET THE CRICKET!
OH NO
oh hey this the thousand years door?
IT'S TASTING TIME!
crap not good
dragon is not amused
GOTTA USE THE HAMMER!
also USE dat koopa troopa!
MOTHERFUGGIN STYLEISH LIKE A BOSS!
Dragon smack
oh damn
CrimsonPhoenix: I don't dislike challenge, man.
ITEM!
NewSuperBronyU, you can counter those claws
otakon: Something tells me you are REALLY into this...
Zuxxez123: I am
okay Koops can take another hit
MEAT SHIELD!
what does that mushroom in the top right mean?
oni_link: porn
oni_link: it's an item you can randomly get during the battle
Calcos323, you can also think of those "unneeded" challenges as personal acihevements
STYLEISH LIKE ABAWS
oh
like those Achievements in Xbox360, PS3 and Steam
CrimsonPhoenix: You already explained that, and I understand now. Self-fulfillment is good
HAMMER TIME!
Crystaline_Shard: Is that why I couldnt stop looking at it?
CrimsonPhoenix: steam achivments arin't pointless :/
yeah just wanted to put up an example
Tactic: Beat it until it cries
Crystaline_Shard, I never said that but
So his toe is dizzy?
GNIGHT EVERYPONY
in a sense they are
Okay.
Night Bronysith
Night, Bronysith :)
CrimsonPhoenix: Yeah, most achievements are crap, but when I'm playing a game I put a LOT of time in, and I get praised for it, I'll take it. :D
since they're COMPLETELY optional to enjoy a game
Night Bronysith
G'night Bronysith
CrimsonPhoenix: However, as a person that's been playing and learning the same game for almost 4 years now, I can say that I don't think I'll ever do a Nuzlocke run anytime soon.
CrimsonPhoenix: in TF2 you get shit for doing them and quite alot of other steam games
STYLISH LIKE A BAWS
CrimsonPhoenix: I just don't see the point
Crystaline_Shard, you can unlock those....without the achievment
Dat peril
HEAL KOOPS!
remember in the good ol' days when games were still on cartridge
CrimsonPhoenix: you can but achiment get is faster generally.
FOR THE LOVE OF PONIES HEAL DAT KOOPS!
you never had achievment but you still had unlockables
STYLE LIKE A BAWS!
damn lucky
IT'S A TRAP!
LIES
LIES!
LIES AND DECIET
LIES!
Achievements are pointless when they dont reward you but at the same time, they give you structure in your gameplay. You tend to play the game the way the devs intended rather than to just beat it as quick as possible
Hai everypony
take the bribe :D
Crystaline_Shard, remember Super Smash Brothers Melee and how there was ALOT of ways to unlock one character?
Hi, DerpyMuffins :)
Woah Paper Mario?
hi DerpyMuffins
Hey DerpyMuffins!
Hey DerpyMuffins
Number one or two?
Achievements rewards are pointless as well
oni_link: Totally agreed, if it wasn't for some achievements, people would just stay on one path and never change course.
lol
you can just simply do the thing and bam unlock, you don't needa label for it
THE HELL?
CrimsonPhoenix: NON BELIVER!
did he just eat THE CROWD?!
I...think so.
Eeyup
woah
I did NOT see that coming
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
KUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Me neither. :O
HEAL Koopa!
otakon: Yeah, the boss fights are nuts in this game
HEAL HIM DAMMIT!
oh crap not good
STYLE...........LIKE A BAWS!
Stallion_of_War: samuwri??
This is paper mario right?
DO EET
Yeah
eeyup
STAR POWUR
Which one?
USE THE SPECIAL DAMMIT!
Derpy_Hooves: 1000 year door.
Crystaline_Shard, you don't get it do you
Hakuouden?
NewSuperBronyU: seriously if you don't use that special you're gonna lose
Zuxxez123: I try to get some but not all because typically you cant get them all in the first run anyways. and also, If I end up beating a game, it adds to the replay value as well :)
SHE'S TOO DAMN WEAK
DerpyMuffins: 1000 year door.
CrimsonPhoenix: NON BELIVER :D
NewSuperBronyU: you HAVE to use the Koopa
Crystaline_Shard, don't try my patience
Mario is winded
NewSuperBronyU: HEAL or the next attack will end you
let me figure it for you

Peach has a voice actor now?
NewSuperBronyU: Then I'll do my best to keep tabs. Thanks again for choosing this game. Means a lot to me
^
I wish I had a connection to the game. :(
Fighting Games are still the best
If someone playing Symphony of the Night; I'd be ALL over that in a heartbeat. xD
It's nice when people talk in colours and hilight key information
Grodus duuuuuuude
Zuxxez123: Same here. :$
Zuxxez123, WHAT IS A MOD?
11,02Calcos323: Np, I love this game :D
Zuxxez123: Am I the only person on the planet that prefers Super Castlevania 4 to SotN?
CrimsonPhoenix: A miserble little pile of secerts perhaps?
A miserable little pile of ponies
I fought Sirens once, pounded their faces into the desert and ripped the top half of their heads off
but enough talk
have at you
Castlevania: HIT EVERYTHING
So you add a lot of dialog to a mario game and everything becomes paper. Is that what this game is about?
Meh. Don't really like SC4, IMO.
Calcos323: Naw, a lot of people like Super Castlevania 4. But I have a connection to SoTN personally.
Roselina?
Zuxxez123: Gotcha
darnit, now I wana play Castlvania. Anyone know any online place to play?

/me nodds
i wasn't on this show either, and i see why
NewSuperBronyU, will you be my super special somepony for hearts and hooves day?
I'm more of the Simpson's crowd
00,03MERRIKA <3
is that a bad thing? o.o
Hah
^
DerpyMuffins: Ditto.
its big mac
Eeyup
I can't relate to this people! I relate better with people from the future!
I guess being from Texas I can appreciate this show.
Or maybe I just like it
Wasnt Dale in an MLP episode?
I dunno.
NewSuperBronyU! why you deny my wub wub wub?
he was?????
Don't think he was. :S
awww, that would've been awesome
ok im writing a fanfiction where twilight gets stuck in our world my friend is wondering if i shoulkd make her human
I think it was in the buffilo episode
dynamo2814: Keep her a pony. :)
Keep her a pony
DerpyMuffins: I'll do some research and find out for you. :D
i read the lyra one where shes a human
its fantastic :3
Wow did that guy ask taht and then just leave?
The Hills have eyes.
Barbetos: Guess he did.
lol Meanwhile
Yeah, keep her a pony. I'm not really a fan of the humanized ponies
^
Lyra` Anthropology ?
i'm back, what did i miss? :3
That started my love for Lyra.
i fight you TheKatPony
and it was ;D
so good <3
keeping the color scheem
AJIsAwesome: What about humanized cosplayers like Tara?
and they still think theyre ponies and act like ponies :3
..or anyone for that matter
Yeah, it just doesn't sit right with me :/
buffer
damn you buffer
J_E_Smith71: I think that is different. I mean, changing the characters to humans is nothing like cosplaying as the character.
or like when the give RD wings even as a human? o.e
J_E_Smith71: Cosplaying characters such as ponies are fine, but not when the characters themselves are humanized.
I kinda find it a turn off when I see Twilight's horn in human form
^^
because it's wrong
AJIsAwesome: I can totally agree with that. Humanizing the characters themselves just is off in my opinion. But seeing a fan dress like their favorite character is totally fine.
she doesnt need a horn ;3
The fact that they were designed that way from the very beginning makes them unique, and to see them turned into something different kills it for me.
once.
Ouch
She cheated with the Indian right?
yikes
If you're gonna make them human, don't give them horns or wings :/
AJIsAwesome: So, do you not like when other characters are ponified?
and Hank is clueless
Huh.
That just makes them look worse.
Clueless Hank is best Hank.
oh yeah, you too :3
Zuxxez123: Not really. Some I do, but most of them not because of their given design.
ello everpony back from school
Hi, Lunar_Brony|AFK :)
Hm. I wonder how you guys would feel about a humanized rarity that is not white.
*LunasGuard|Tired:
Or any pony not white when going human
AJIsAwesome: It's hard to make a good ponified character.
hi LunasGuard|Tired
hey LunasGuard
Your missing a ' LunasGuard
Zuxxez123: Agreed. The design must be very similar to the person/thing in reality.
Hi LunasGuard|Tired
this show makes me feel stupid
Glad Im not
ello AJIsAwesome thelonepony Slater
makes me feel stupid...
Lyra`: Just means it's working.
--> OPS GNAA IS ONLINE <-- spotted in other channels already. Watch your asses...
AJIsAwesome: I've always been hoping for a Beatles Pony version, but quickly ditched that because I just know it would look silly.
poor bill
thats the saddest thing ive ever seen.
Heh Bill microwaving a frozen turkey dinner
Zuxxez123: I wouldn't mind that, as long as each one has something different from each other. :)

Only thing I like about Thanksgiving is spending time with my family. Nothing.
i hate this show.
Turkey is brilliant.
Zuxxez123: agreed
*Nothing more
Now can we watch Breaking Bad?
Lyra`: I'm not that fond of it either tbh.
Lyra` its kind of depressing, even when it tries so hard to be funny.
lol, Slater
Sweet potatos with brown sugar and marshmellows on top. OH god yes please. xD
Lyra`: well you don't have to watch it but please don't complain about it. Remember the streamers don't have to stream here eh?
Meh. I never really liked Turkey.
I don't know. King of the Hill is on that line of entertainment and silly
^^

I LOVE this game's humor...

LunasGuard|Tired: i dont even think ponyville has phones
paper mario was a hell of a game!

Espectially Professor Frankly's fourth wall breaking, "And YOU! In front of the TV/Computer!"
Lyra`, it was awesone :O

superretroworld: I seen Let's Plays of it.

OOhohohoh
Koops is actually sort of like me in reality...
VenHur: the dialogues great

Lyra`: Thousand year door.
But I can be a bit of a nuthead sometimes.
'last night there was a solitare touranment, i lost my shirt' :D
ohai LadyCanary. Do you know how to cheer someone up?
this is the second one I believe
Lunar_Brony: Something troubling you?
I mean, Im not the best but I'll try.
LadyCanary is just the right person for that ^_^
Who else is exciting for the 3DS game?

I like Sticker Star so far, It going back to the turn by turn fomula we seen in the first two installments, instead of the platforming we seen in Super Paper Mario.
oh my
NewSuperBronyU: Can't wait to see your opinion on the game. :)
"COMPLIMENT BOTHER MEH" >:{

Lyra` wat

Lyra`: I'd appreciate if you didnt ^^" as flattering as it may be.
What will be played next I wonder...
Kammerjunk: exactly
then, ill kill you with flattery and kind words
0,14...
I am very confused right now.
And gameplay wise, I don't know what's with the fan and all those crap, but there's better be a Toad partner...
play some Skyrim Sord
I mean, we NEVER got a Toad for a partner...
Lunar_Brony: So what's up? :o
Well what can a toad do?
yeah, not like Super Mario Bros. 2 had you play as Toad or anything
no one likes toad
It's Brawl time!
i was making the introo and the brawl select scared me ;_;
well, im off to PTFO
night bronies
...I would loved if a Toad partner mentions the infamous "Your Princess is in another castle" line.
Night Lyra|PTFO
NIght, Lyra|PTFO :)
Goodnight Lyra|PTFO

Goodnight Lyra|PTFO.

overly drmatic music is overly dramatic
Goodnight Lunar_Brony~

This is my least favorite intro of the Smash Series so far.
Yes or No: We need a remake of Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald for the 3DS soon
Yes
why cant braw lhave anime
Yes.
funny how red was bfighting against pikachu there
But I'm okay with pokemon White 2
aww
Sure, the music's great, but all it shows is gameplay...and some cutscenes from the story mode...
Melee was the best for me.
HHHHAAAIIIIIIIII all
Night Lunar_Brony,

:D
11,02Ugggh...going to try using the GCN controller this time around cause I can't find my Nunchuck ><
Hi, Queen_Chrysalis :)
the gamecube controller is superior anyways
Gamecube controller is best controller.
super smash bros universe will be better than 2 and 3........oh yes
SHould I join?
NewSuperBronyU: Can't you play it old school?
GC controller > Wiichuck
Aww hay, missed it, was scrolled up.
NewSuperBronyU: Well that's the way to play it anyways
Here we go!
The muffin mare versus the Gamer Brony, who would win?
NewSuperBronyU: don't you ever play in a random stage?
gonna try to get Brawl working tomorrow if ya want to challenge me
keep in mind it might be during A movie
So who's SB fighting?
Derpy.
If I
Kammerjunk: Derpy_Hooves as usual
derpyhooves
i wonder.......who was the first rony.....adn the first MLP FIM fanfic
Derpy.
*brony *and
otakon: Ah, alright.
the first bronies were from 4chan
learn your history
flutterchu: I believe the first fanfic was "Cupcakes"
flutterchu: Someone on /co/.
I HATES 4Chan....never been to the site...
SB's friendcode list is probs close to full, but pm if you want his FC so you can join
the first bronies were techinically from the times of g1, way before 4chan
what's 4chan
VenHur: DOn't bother.
The first brony? Would that consist of G1 fans?
I'm joining after this game
VenHur: It's not really a good place.
Zuxxez123: no
I've been to 4Chan once. As soon as the page loaded I got a TON of viruses and malware
*pm me
That depends on what you define "brony" as.
SB is busy playing :p
Kammerjunk: True.
Oh hi, Kammerjunk.
VenHur: Well, that's not a very good basis for hate. It's really not the whole "wr r legiun lol", it's just mostly bad.
twilight_sprinkle1: i dont even think any male fans of mlp existed in g1
Oh hi, donutpop365.
superretroworld: theres val
superretroworld: Andrew WK
superretroworld: There could've.
oh wow, you people actually think it's full of viruses and shit

Where have I heard this OST before? .-.
i guess you're right Eddmario . even though my computer works fine after going there all the time, obviously it infects your computer within seconds
everyone mind*
lord help me
Its the super mario world credit song
Buytoast: I'm just saying that some parts of teh site can be bad for your computer
only if you're stupid enough to go to them
NSFW is the material that can cause those awkward conversations with your boss at work
superretroworld: Nothing with that friend.
*sigh* Now I have brentalfloss in my head again...
Thanks Rustymeat~ :3
the only character in this game that doesnt get his/hers/its own stage is R.O.B

0,14if Capcom's taught me anything, it's that if you want megaman in something, prepare to be disappointed
I mean, who wouldn't want to have a team match with Mario and Luigi versus Sonic and Tails?
I'm actually hoping Rayman gets into a SSB game.

Yes, it is.
o.o Damn, playing the song by ear?
Tha first part?
AdamTheDuck: im bored what should i do?
SPOT ON!
/me 13has good ears
/me has perfect pitch :$
Polydunami: You have it too? :O
/me plays cello
Dat pitch
NENUDJUS, watch music get played by ear like what Shizu is doing right now? :3
What is a pitch?
/me also has perfect pitch :$
Selling producets?
Wait, I'm not alone in this world?
:( I wish I was good at things like this. v_v I'm just getting old
Polydunami: /)
/) AJIsAwesome
how do you know if you have perfect pitch?
inb4 space is 20% cooler
AdamTheDuck: im to laggy i can only get chat atm
13^-^
Ryunosuke, lol ikr XD
13stick that in your hat :3
/me is waiting for Shizuka to do Night of Pony. XD
Vordox: :D
Looks excellent so far.
Shizuka, that would fave taken me three hours to do that. How you do it in one minute??? D8
/me does not have perfect pitch, but does not care because f u
magic
NENUDJUS, hmm, that's a pity. Let me think... :P
13unfortunately i can't squeeze the shorter notes in
/me has to have good ears to tune instrument
Well, if you can tell what key a song is in by ear, Kurra, then you have perfect pitch.
oh.
AdamTheDuck: ask me anything
Can you adjust the tempo at all, Shizuka?
Kurra: Perfect pitch (also referred to as absolute pitch) is an ability to instantaneously identify or sing any given musical note without a reference pitch. There are two types of perfect pitch: active and passive. A person with active perfect pitch is able to sing or hum any given pitch; that is, if they are asked to sing a B flat without hearing the said note or any reference note, they can, whereas a person with passive perfect pitch cannot.
what's a key? :s
NENUDJUS, why is Spike best pony?
13yeah but it starts throwing things off
DAT TEXT WALL. :$
13pretty sure i can't do triplets
Oh. Dang
Well, that's kind of lame :(
AdamTheDuck: well because he is not a pony
Polydunami: What is?
NENUDJUS, :|
oh, thats what perfect pitch is? then i have it too
:P
dahr derp doop!
/me does not have perfect pitch...
twilight_sprinkle1: /)
AJIsAwesome: (\
Oh wow, so that is three people here so far
perfect pitch isnt that rare though
But it's not common, either though.
AdamTheDuck: keep up the questions ill do my best to reply with my awesome brain!
You kidding? I'm the only one I know who has perfect pitch
/me inb4 ya'll are just liein' :P
/me has something sorta vaguely like perfect pitch.... but... not perfect
Spectrum_Rush: Actually, I'm not. :S
i knew a lot of people with perfect pitch..then again, i was in music school
I'm not that creative.
Kurra: You mean relative pitch?
and in choirce
*choire
*choir? :P
yeah, that :P
NENUDJUS, stream is too distracting XD
english isnt my first language..
AdamTheDuck: :p
twilight_sprinkle1: Ah, I see. What is, then?
AJIsAwesome, I don't even know what it's called. Or what it is. *languishes in stupid music theory ignorance* v_v
Mario Paint, eat your heart out.
AJIsAwesome: rashan!
Kurra: It's okay. :)
twilight_sprinkle1: Nice.
No offense to those that grewed up with Mario Paint, it's good too.
I never did. :$

Looks like we'er playing mario paint
AdamTheDuck: to hard, questions! now!
XylemTube: Nope. :)
NENUDJUS, I'll start you off: Lalalalalalala
Nope, it's actually a different game called SimTunes.
^
Okay, this is getting slightly immature :P
It's an accapella simulator!
What do you mean?
You know, by the same guys who doned The Sims, Spore, SimCity, all those stuff.
ah spore
what a steaming pile of disspaointmnet
Spore seemed like such a good game before it came out
Ah remember when people paid cold hard bits just to make creatures that they couldn't even play with online.
AdamTheDuck: im a pillar of knowledge ask me anything
I liked Spore...but yeah, it can gets boring after the Cell stage...
NENUDJUS, what comes into play in a bullet's trajectory when fired at extremely long distances? .-.
\/\/\/\/\/\/
^^^^^^
Toes vVVv vVVv :)
(V)O,,,,O(V)
ew toes
Going to bed, night
toes are awesome |3
feet are gross, they should be cut off and replaced with paws or hooves
o3o
But what about hands? :<
no they're not D: feet are as cool as hooves or fins or tails.
hands are ok
feet are wonderful
hands RAWK, they make great swiss army tools cx
PAWS RAWK o///o
I like my feets, thanks you very much...
hooves > feet
paws>=hooves>feet
Feet>hooves, IMO.
I prefer feet.
youre all sick!
can't stub your hoof
okay feet: uuuuU Uuuuu and paws: vVVv vVVv and hooves are uh... ( ) ( )
Yeah, it's basically one big nail.
Rather, fingernail
you can crack your hoof.
and now I might not like hooves so much >_<
oh relax.
11,02I got mah mail-in voter card thingy in the mail today O3O
What about getting Horse shows nailed into your hooves for comforts sake?
NewSuperBronyU: Aren't you fancy?
11,02Yesh ^-^
shoes*
every kind of extremity has its vulnerabilities, so just enjoy feet or hooves for what they are, fun and nice to massage and great tools.
then agaio, effort to crack hoof > effort to stub toe
No nerve endings, Zuxxez123
NewSuperBronyU: that tells us exactly nothing of what you mean :/
11,02:<
Silver_Spoon: But the pain when you stub your toes is horrid...
11,02It means I know where I'm going to vote on election day ;~;
Polydunami: Ah, I know nothing about horses so yeah...
11,02Plus the issues that are presented...and stuff O~O
I might do my own version of the MLP theme with Mario Paint Composer soon...
vote for ponies!
Yay votings! Enjoy your ballot casting
lol I'm eating cereal with chocolate milk and a measuring cup :p
NewSuperBronyU: ah ok then :>
I kind of like horses, but not enough where I know every damned thing about them.
SuperBrony.
I'm writing in lauren faust for president...
Just need to think of the right pitchs and what'll I use...
11,02I'm voting for Gunthler :3

Probably on my end
Queen_Chrysalis: ima fireing mah lazer
Yeah, it works
Scottish-geeky: Is it making music?
Something with an "saving the galaxy in the fates of the hand" feel...

You mean this song fades out?
Petrified_Discord: ?

/me 13wails on her air guitar
Scottish-geeky: Animusic's lasers make music. Do yours?

Petrified_Discord: i dont have this porgram
The Doctor is a nice fellow, isn't he? :3
Lasers make the best music.
I mean, part of this song have that...Toonami-ish feel...

A bit eccentric, but what can you expect?

I've listened to the entire piece countless times, so I would recognise it if I heard it, Shizuka
this is a great stream*
its one of he best streams ive seen here
xmasmare, it truely is XD
GONG
I'd say it would be a Jimmy Hart version of the 1812 Overture
my dear celestia... what manner of magic is this?
Sup everypony and hi Shizuka thats streaming
Buytoast: http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/ec3d/
13well yeah there's obviously not a drum kit in 1812 :3
Shizuka, you should do more Shizumusic streams XD
Moopy: ello

ello
i can stop using a pool noodle
hi moopy
hi
and get a real tentacle
Moopy: my man!!
13not my favorite track btw that one... the organs get a bit overpowering

Yeah, like a Shizumusic stream of Mario Paint, or Wii Music or something else music related...
Encore!

DeathStar: MY man!
13of which i have neither :3
Wait, same contraption but different song
Shizusic

Ohai Moopy
NENUDJUS: woman* XD
Shizuka: You could do Mario Paint on an emulator
Oh hey, Moopy

Shizuka, do you like classic music?
DeathStar: My ... WAman... yea!
/me glomps DeathStar
J_E_Smith71 your bugging the wrong person for those game
SB64 might stream em though
Chrysalis: well it is mario so it's possible

Chrysalis: No I mean I was following up with what VenHur said for her to do Mario Paint's music thing
Mario Paint composer enough?
why is no pony talking to me
THIS NOT POSSIBLE!
:(
hi scottish :D
lol
/me hugs Queen_Chrysalis

13moar cowbell
Polydunami: hay i know a witch and she is very nice
Oh, pardon me :S
Shizuka: i think thre's a 10hour cowbell vid
huh
never seen this one
:|
Now this reminded me of Canon in D Major.
13this one's awesome
wow lazer worms :D
13epic bass line
:D
13riiiiight now
this is really nice Shizuka
Ho. ly. shiiiiiiit...
what this 1 calles Shizuka
Dat bass!
13this is Fiber Bundles
aww that would of been awesome to leave it unlit
13which also doesn't have a proper ending
except by the energy pulses
13i believe the DVD lets you isolate instruments, but not sure
Oh?
13they would have made zillions if this were an interactive program
Oh, absolutely
13i remember hearing that at the least the songs would come with alternate camera tracks
The render times for these must have been FUCKING INSANE
13so if you can't isolate an instrument you can at least focus on it without the camera moving around
ASoftFluffyThing why?
could run this realtime
Shizuka: Oh, deffinetly, I would go nuts to use songs with only the bass lines!
DeathStar: allo
13this echo is brilliant
VenHur why, a song without a meolody is just boring
This is why i bought Bose headphones
Scottish-geeky: hello
Pinkies4thWall this is why i bought bose desktop speakers :P
The drums just reminded me of In the Air Tonight :S
DeathStar: how are you
Chrysalis: /)
Scottish-geeky: I'm good
13i love how the source at the top just goes nuts when the percussion picks up
DeathStar: thats good
this is so epic
So much bass it's awesome
AdamTheDuck: so how are ya mate
Anyone here?
13now for mister gyroscopes basic drum loops from any given keyboard
Scottish-geeky, still in a cheery mood lol :P
13aka Gyro Drums
AdamTheDuck: thats good :P
ASoftFluffyThing: Vinyl approves ^_^
I did nothing productive for a whole week and loved it XD
He's making music for the dark lich from Secret of Mana :P
Mr. Gyro has got swag
MadSurge: swag is a evil word
Here comes the cowbell
Also, drum solos are awesome :$
moo
This is quite a... balanced song :P
Moo.
Well, beat.
moo

moo
Moo.

I'm the one who brought that to this site
mzp: *facehoof*
no they didn't have it before NotJim
mzp: how would you know if you wern't here?
Dude, we all know you're a liar. Nobody trust mzp, he's a liar

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDzjufg7sTs&feature=g-vrec
no I mean I never heard it before on this stream and one day I gave a link and they seemed to keep playing it's epicness
I do consider it another chapter in my life when the time comes
mzp: SILENCE, INPUDENT FOAL!!
And if DeathStar Likes you then you must be doing something right.
NotJim:no
aww sweet they did made some changes that i see they made the video screens wider now
I'm just not sure yet what changes will happen once moving day comes..
It will certainly be an adventure I bet...
Mega_Milk: not always ^_^ sometimes I like people for the wrong reasons. like how I like the joker :3
mzp: Watch out, or I will do the unthikable.
DeathStar: Pfft....He never did anything wrong really.
NotJim: try me
DeathStar: Not one of his capturs has been harmed.
I'm trying to make sure I have some sort of 2nd option incase the first move doesnt work out with my family
DeathStar: So if anything he's just an extreme prankster.
the funny part is me and NotJim are in skype
mzp: Last warning. Next time you speak, I shall HANG UP ON SKYPE!!
NotJIm: do it you won't
mzp vs NotJim a flame war of not so epic ness
Mega_Milk: no his captors do die.. alot.. especialy in the newer comics...

AdamTheDuck http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgk-lA12FBk
there is my answer
I wonder if the Wii U has a codename, like the Gamecube's codename being "Dolphin".
:P
Inb4 Nintendo implements a printer in the Wii U
If they do, I'll make a .gif that shows it printing fake money
the Wii U is the codename
I'm glad they're down playing motion controls.
the official name will be the Nintendo wiiPad
Well, the Wii U still has motion controls, but not much.

Spell-of-Gaming Plus the option i took was actually pretty straight forward it was about commenting on a poem about boredom then tell some of your own exprience and how you deal with it.
AdamTheDuck: im as unhealthy (and still walking) as they get
Started around 8:20 AM and finished it off at around 10 AM
I was also the first to deliver and go home

What happened to you gamers? It seems somewhere along the way, you turned from doing good and so now evil's holding sway. Rythim games and fitness games and even cooking sims! What else are we to do? Fight the fight in ol' skyrim!
NewSuperBronyU is extremely tired
11,02My sister is playing.

Fillies and Gentelcolts, I present the Internet. <--
Humanity is very proud
dis chat be ded
11,02Sorry, I'm nearly passing out here ><
11,02I'm ending the stream here, night all :)
Like I said
NewSuperBronyU, is extremely tired
night NewSuperBronyU !
g'night NewSuperBronyU
whelp, Unless Wrek comes in and starts streaming, Im leaving.
guess not, see ya everypony
/me coughs
ded chat is deeed
was it something I said?
Nope
this has to be a new record of silence
Nah
/me is currently painting.
I think it's been worse
whatcha paintin' Spell-of-Gaming
Flowers.
For my art class.
the pretty kind?
...Not exactly.
the man-eating kind?
here i will no loger make a silence in ur home https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykmNPeRScDM u might want to turn down ur speakers if there up high
The ugly kind, actually.
ugly flowers? blasphemy!
I wish I used poster color, though. I'm using watercolor right now.
the silentest the chat has ever been in recent times is about 30 minutes between posts, It happen one time when Wrek had an emergency and for got to end stream
dayum
Poster color > Watercolor
charcoal > everything
Are you implying that I should paint with charcoal?
but yeah, i hate water color too
yes, you will be a pioneer in art!
There was an option that we could use either oil pastels, watercolor or poster color.
Unfortunately, I'm not really good with oil pastels and I don't have any poster color. FML
painting with pastels sounds difficult
You have to avoid spaces to make it perfect.
i think they staart to smell a bit burny if you use a lot if i remember correctly too
traditional media is all hard i guess, digital is best for me
I'm starting to think if the world's greatest artists hate water color too.
i dont know of many artists in general that use it
save for one western manga artist whose name i cant remember
so do you do much painting outside of class?
Not really, but I am interested in the history of painting.
oh cool
hey guys
o hai alexxm

BMN is today for me

its been a while since i last saw ya.
yeah im not here very often anymore
i still show up every now and thenn though
http://www.flickr.com/photos/35235612@N05/7015439027/ here's one of the houses
so hows things pinkiespice ?
okay
Been a week or two since Iw as on too I think- or active
how are things pinkiespice
much better today then yesterday
at least im not longer depressed
what happened yesterday
Vivix: thats so cool, and it snows there. im on a new league of jelly
Hehe, snow is pretty awesome
Went to a job fair yesterday with on the spot interviews
pinkiespice: depression isnt fun
Sounds stressfull
oh no luck then?
i went out of the interview as quikly as i went in
quickly*
its like speed-dating, but with added stress!
Apperntly they still have had a record of my first aplpcation and my first interview from a few years ago
so they decided not to even bother with me
Ooh..
ouch
And i was preparing for it since sunday
when i found out they were desprately looking for emploies
I mostly felt like i walked into a creampie to the face and hulimated myself
sorry to hear that
someone needs an internet-hug
/me hugs pinkiespice :/
so sucky day huh?
OMG
sleeping over it made me feel better though
MORE SLOTS FOR EMOTICONS IN ANIMAL CROSSING 3DS
YEAHHHHHHH
Dat nerdgasm :3
I don't know wether to show up my face in the local chain anymore
I'm terrified of interviews-
Enjoying the Nintendo Direct so far.
I don't think i'm crazy for ing this, but i think maybe, possibly. Spell-of-Gaming likes nintendo slightly
since apperntly they recongized my facce from back then.
hehe
pinkiespice: never lose hope
Yeah, that's important
it was one of my favorite chains too >_<
I love Nintendo. :P But I'm not one of those fanboys who praise every game in every Nintendo console.
As far as Nintendo goes, im a Zelda nut
but thats about it, well i like mario too, but not nearly aas much
I grew up without nintendo- so the only game I remember is from playing with friends, so that's goldeneye
have tried zelda and mario, of course, mother is a huuuge mario nerd, but I'm not really
goldeneye was awesome, but it didnt age very well
yeaa
the rom download was 5 mb <,<
i grew up with the first pokemon that was actually the first game i owned
Vivix: mario rom?
Aah, I was never that into pokemon, but I really like the way that they Loook (feral nerd) but- I think I might get into some of the games, maybe
eh goldeneye rom
I idled all night on TF2. The stuff I got. Is mostly stuff I already have :<
O.o
Good morning Ponies47 :P
Happy I didn't ping you?
I love pokemon, i got tired of it after like gen 3 though
Which one was gen 3?
I only remember gen 1, but I've seen a lot of the others online
I just stopped at Saphire and Ruby
I've been here AdamTheDuck. And actually I had headphones connected to my computer so I didn't hear anything. And if anyone did ping me last night I didn't hear it. I just wanted to waste there time! :P
g3 was Emerald i think
AdamTheDuck ruby and saphire
Yeah, it got boring after Emerald...
I was reading on the pokemon wiki, for some reason,
apparently ..mew is the only pokemon who does not lay eggs, but gives birth
.-.
I think it was Mew
it was just too repetitive to do the same thing a third time, then a fourth
thats odd
it said it was because mew predated the egg thing info from some game, but they kept it in the later games- so it became canon I guess
I hear that Ditto is a genetic reject clone of Mew
Hehehe
so mews basically god then
Hm
which makes mewtwo a reject ditto
where did it say ditto was a reject mew
i dont think its canon, but like theory
ah like garys ratticate dying
Ded chat?
since the ditto are all around mewtwo, and mew can use transform. it is theorized that dittos are failed attempts to clone mew same as mewtwo
Phase4 i dident know you ported the derpy.me add on to chrome
Maybe it wasn't Mew, trying to find the text now
Ooh, I love things like that CJ
00,02JRP2234, i did but its not on the chrome addon store thing
suddenly, Phase4
Hehe, so I was going through http://derpy.me/rR5TM , one of the panels had "Garbodor - now there's a pokemon". Jesus the new pokemons look horrid: (Garbodor) http://derpy.me/MN4Md
cooloours
Phase4 andrew 0_0

00,02JRP2234, you probably don't but go ahead
g i want tp cook me some food Phase4
to*
lol AdamTheDuck
"he Pokémon Mansion journals (which predate Generation II's introduction of breeding) describe Mew giving birth as opposed to laying an Egg. These were not retconned in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen."
Are you gonna stream, Phase4? :P
i wonder if people lay eggs, or perhaps evolved from mew
Phase4 commodore 64
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, can't, exceeded my bandwidth limit
00,02so internet is slow
we lay eggs inside ourselves o.o
"You 'gotta' try Origin."
Vivix: am i a yoshi?

herp deerrrr
Barbetos: i hear its the best game ever
Phase4 is drink 5 beers good for my brain?
I bought that premium stuff
00,02JRP2234, probably not
I have yet to actually play the content I paid for
For me on the other hand its great
:P
Phase4 can you streamm for a min i want to see the quilty of the stream for futer refrence
JRP2234: dont listen to phase, beer is medicine for the everything
Its how you kill da cold
beer is the soultion to all problems
00,02JRP2234, have you ever seen a skype video call? halve that and remove sound, thats the quality of stream i am capable of right now

Kerbal camera feed?
Phase4 tell me if im talking to much so i can stop
00,02XD

Wait there is a stream?
00,02what is it with people and beer
You are talking to mych. that us mah jerb.
00,02Ponies47, not that i'm aware of
Phase4 I just really love beer.
I drank enough to actually taste the good in it
It goes great with some food too, if you do it right
Kind of like some wines and italian food.
Phase4: Oh. I wasen't paying attention. Thought you starrted streaming or somthing
*Started

00,02Barbetos, the problem with beer and me is that lightheaded feeling scares the shit out of me
f--
how come
"Fallout: New Vegas was almost 'too' polished, ya know?"
Phase4 HOW THE FUCK do you download 500 gb in a month?
i dont actually like alcohol in general, plus i cant drink it even if i wanted too
00,02JRP2234, 200'

Hmm
STILL HOW
It depends on what is being downloaded
00,02and i didn't, someone else pulled about 80 while i wasn't looking
JRP2234, I managed 170 gigs in one month XD

Been a while since I have listend to Haymaker

I can't accept your rejection
I love wonderful lyrics \:3/

I played Pony Kart :3
The AI on pinkie pie and Aj are a little wonky
I saw people playing Fighting is Magic at Canterlot Gardens. But the line to play it was so looooooooooooooooooooong. So I passed
It will come out in due time
I atleast watched people play it. I looks pretty awesome I'm pretty sure I'll be getting the game when it's comeplete
tiem for something different http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPXGELbDmqA
00,02Barbetos, ponykart was open source last time i looked
complete*
Phase4 o really?
*It
Well any jack ass could of had that set up
00,02yeah, i even looked through the sources
I still played it though
Ponies47: it must've been a long line, but i would still be in it
o/
btw i'm back
Welcome back Dark92Enigma-
wb Dark92Enigma-
Oh wait, gotta change my nick
is it gona hurt?
there we go
nope. it didn't
I need to find and download that Uma Floresta song
Its needs to be a pmv
Dark92Enigma-: It was to long for me. I also passed on getting autographs. I wasen't going to wait in line for 5 hours just to get Tara Strongs autograph. Plus you had to PAY to get autographs.
00,02Barbetos, yeah, here it is http://sourceforge.net/p/ponykart/code/
Huh
Well I dunno what to think now
Well Brony Fan fair made a big deal out of it
sorta
Ponies47: pay for them?? were them really 5 HOURS¡?
00,02Barbetos, i assume some of the art assets are closed still but that does run
Whoops. Closed Bstate by accident
00,02infact i was impressed, the apple achers map was a little unoptimized and had 600k polygons
Dark92Enigma: Yes they were making you PAY for them. I wasen't going to do that they wanted $20 just to get a picture with them -_-
00,02and it ran 60fps including all the shaders
00,02that was on my old laptop with its shoddy gpu
Corporative bastards...........
If i ever get an autograph, i hope i don't have to pay
brb breakfast time for me
That is pretty good actually
The engine was written to?
That alone is pretty impressive
Most people seem to just use UDK or something
I left my cats outside last night :S
Its too late. Check your everything.
There might be.. surprises
Nah there fine
morning, everypony! :)
Time fore something soothing and different, my favouite song on the album: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKpBorhMLhI
Sup Sylandest!
Ohai Sylandest
howdy Ponies47, AdamTheDuck :)
/me Goes back to working on art
AdamTheDuck: no stream atm, i take it?
Sylandest, nope, tis why I linked a song :P
AdamTheDuck: good thinking! I'm still coming to consciousness, lol. Woke up about 10 minutes ago
Ok here's a question that's pretty much impossible answer. If you had the choice to A. Be a pony but still live here in this world or B. Live in Equestria but you would still have to be a human. Which would you choose and why?
Sylandest, check out the song, it's a fine way to start a morning :3
Equestria
It's ok if you need forever to decide
^ nope :P
Ponies47: go to Equestria. Done.
Sylandest: Yeah but you have to stay in your human form. If was there as a human I would feel outta place.
Ponies47, I'd assume they may make one welcome.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcCCb3MgpKw amv
Ponies47: I feel I would be able to adapt well enough. It would be tricky at first, but I could make it work
AdamTheDuck: I would just feel outta place.
Sylandest: I would rather be a pony insted but also live in Equestria.
Ponies47: but you didnt give us that option :P
Sylandest: Yeah. So it would take me FOREVER to decide :P
Well I gotta go now.
Seeya guys
Bye Ponies47~
laters, Ponies47
I think i'm gonna idle on TF2 while I'm at school

hmm
ponyholics anonymous
Hiya AdamTheDuck
I like the first link
Hehe, which one?
hi Vivix
Pinkie pie propoganda
Phase4: :'(
00,02Vordox, ?
I know, seemed appropriate as it had the "Welcome" song in it to welcome our new guest, BoroBrony :P
Hehe yeah
00,02my my, lots of new ponies these days
Phase4: Having 3 languages at same time...
/me 00,02hugs BoroBrony
Not good for computer
I don't listen enough to brony music, despite making brony music, but I'm not big on electronica or that big on orchestral, so it often slips my mind
Phase4: The delay is still from AS3 though
So....
What now?
it was a nive welcome it good to be here with people who like MLP
o/ Phase4
dam laptop meant nice
Feeling like "Scrap" is the only true way now... But how to make the game? :(
What's going on?
00,02Vordox, actionscript was never that good for real time, your only issue with pure javascript is the animations and i'm not sure how to do those
I hope this guy does more chiptune/classical songs, I've already listed to most of them... :/ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTR9xLhC2nM
you trying to use javascript and..canvas?
Lets see what other amazing works I can scavenge from my youtube history~
Use FiM++ its the obvious choice
interesting mix
Hehe
I find canvas to be--good, but--
chrome is slow, firefox has bugs, ie9 works fine-chrome and ie9 I think draws aliasing a bit odd
Chrome tends to feel like it considers if you really want to see that page you just put in the address bar sometimes
Vivix, I simply chose Chrome for the customisation :P
Oh and it likes to crash flash sometimes
Chrome loves crashing Shockwave.
I like using chrome, but I'm making a html5 drawing room thing, and--it draws canvases MUCH slower than any other browser i try
and I can't figure out why
It's amazing. -_-
night gents
00,02chrome is built around ipc, each tab is a new copy of chrome, which would be ok but it really is built around ipc and the ipc channels are not so fast
Nacht XAX. :3
00,02night XAX
Nightie
Goodnight XAX
Huh
Google and youtube won't load for me
night night
But everything else will
:o
is there any way to make chrome react faster in canvas? I mean even drawing, it has fewer points per second than the other browser, making lines a bit choppier-
Night XAX
Mentlegen, I welcome everyone to 'insanity' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5jKuYOotsA
yeah chrome is pretty awesome
00,02Vivix, you can draw in an offscreen canvas and then copy accross
XD
00,02that might be faster, not sure
I can ping them both
Huh. That's odd then.
hm- maybe- it's instant and fast in other browser as it is now, using 4 canvases <,<
I'm using google's DNS servers so maybe they've derped something
Yeah
gotta love that ip range xD
so easy to remember lol
00,02i've never actually seen google offline
its wicked fast lol
00,02if it doesn't work i assume my connection is busted
Nah, I'll just /flushdns
yeah got to be connection problems
Will probably fix
Yep
Fixed
00,02windows dns y u randomly derp
wandows
r u drunk
00,02pdnsd is best dns cache
its always drunk
windows:....no *wine stained shirt*
i found my window lieing in a pit of beer cans
00,02i'm nut dornk offisher
Too much technical talk. 6_9
:)
try being where i work
i do art for ubisoft in newcastle and all i here is technical talk lol :)
hehe
hear*
I am a noob to most things technical, giving up computers for music when I was a teen
but- javascript is fun to learn, and I want a new paintchat
>more recommended videos
cause they're slowly vanishing
>My Little Pony the Mvoei - Full Movie!
Lulno
hehe
Wut.
OH.
Is good moovi, promise
Also recommended is 'eating giant slug'
That I will watch
For some freakin' reason, I got the Barbie movie in my recommended videos this morning.
00,02was there a G2 movie or just tv
I wonder why. >_>
Oh, it's Food For Louis, of course
i might go play some halo later
Ahh, such magnificence. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EezZ0w7J7fg \:3/
It's a shame all my favourite uploaders have sort of stopped puting up new music... :/
Aww
my favourites are probably...mainly just pinkiepieswears
but I like some people on EQbeats, eh everfreeluna? I suck at names
Sim Gretina is my current favorite.
But I've started to like General Mumble.
EverfreeLuna and Meletric
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQXQrPdwego BoroBrony
Phase4, they were better a few months ago.
I feel like such ah ipster sometimes, I've never heard any of the really popular ones
Uhh I youtube for doing that Phase4 >.>
I hate*
Hi everyone :)
I don't really like SoI anymore, it was better when it was just joking around
Hello Lil_B :P
/me politely hugs Lil_B.
http://youtu.be/S4-huzXqyNE <3
"Making frands in Ponaville taday!"
00,02Ninjazz, yeah, disapointed that soi is going nowhere
HAHAHAHAH love that vid
Phase4, Ikr. It had so much going for it.
/me hugs AdamTheDuck and Ninjazz :)
what is SoI ?
Shadow of israphel
aww i feel left out i no get hug :(
Yeah. It took me a while to to think of a good welcome to the fandom video, but I came up with it finally BoroBrony
It's a series by Yogscast
it was a very good choice :)
oh :/ I never watched them, only know them by name :/
I prefer their tekkit series, because- until SoI get's a story or a goal, it feels a bit disjointed and weird, from a show standpoint
/me licks BoroBrony :P
Feels like it's DRAAAAAAGING.
YAY :) :) :) :) :) :)
00,02Vivix, i look at it like its a really strange minecraft game, the tekkit series is fun
btw AdamTheDuck di you wanted to hear the song I was talking about on... Tuesday I think?
Never have I seen someone so happy to be licked.
00,02ohai LightTrooper105, i'm not entirely sure whats going on either
Song? I would love to anyway Lil_B :P
Yeah, Phase4 it's almost like a crazy adventure map
y not be happy with it lol
00,02ohai to you too Silver_Spoon
AdamTheDuck ok :)
someone ping me? o.o
00,02LightTrooper105,
LightTrooper105.
I am begining to think if you put the word Gangnam style in your youtube video name you will instantly get a million views
LightTrooper105 nope xD
ok...
00,02LightTrooper105, no one pinged you, it is in your imagination
perhaps..
00,02LightTrooper105, totaly imagining it
00,02LightTrooper105, still no pings
pings... pings x.x
what internet? why y so slow all of a sudden?
00,02i'm bored btw
LightTrooper105, he's not pinging you. You are.
Barbetos: You'll get those million views faster if you have the word 'tits' in your title.
lol
Gangam tits style sex tapes
yeah as soon as they go in you get 10000 views
nice title i would click it lol :P
There's..maating videos with 14 million views
AdamTheDuck http://soundcloud.com/missing-reaction/shin-onigashima-traditional
I was going to post this yesterday, but seeing chat's current topic, this seems almost appropriate. http://i.imgur.com/80cLo.jpg
http://youtu.be/wa6NfkuDTO8 Meletric, one of my favourite pony artists, even if it's just one song
Mmmm. The new UKF wubs
They sustain me
Ninjazz, oh God wat XD
I had the people in class laughing too loud in class when I was doing that one.
I'm back from braekfast
breakfast*
Ohai agian Dark92Enigma, chat is back to life :3
... appearently Sounmdcloud is making a Halo 4 Remix Contest Oo
hey Dark92Enigma !
Ehh Halo 4...
HI Lil_B !
Get your local church choir in on the halo 4 remix
You will win.
So, are you guys ready for movie night?
Story ended at 3, I wonder why they are still dragging a 4th...
MONEY!!
Go for gold, get your local monastory in it.
(sp)
That and they need to sell more xboxes
Microsoft has a 5000 usd competition on W8 apps
Cause lets face it, halo is the only worth while exclusive on xbox aparently.
Competitions are good advertisement
Mmmm. I wouldn't credit them for it.
maybe make another traditional Remix of a Songs XD ... Halo 4 in Zen ... sounds about right XD
Windows 8 makes me want to start using other operating systems
Eh, it won't affect me
anyone here getting halo 4
Dude, it's the Windows patturn. The next OS after Windows 8 will be better.
haven't played Halo since..2003 or what it is
I bought ODST and played it once. I think I have Reach too.
So no.
Windows 8 is designed for touch screens anyway
yeah,
inb4 we are all forced to use Linux due to Windoes 8 XD
so it's TARGET is, not me
I won't get Halo 4 nor Windows 8 :P
Windows*
Wut. Then it's a tablet OS.
I am fine with linux
so, yeah good for them, but I'm not gonna have any need for it
i will learn
Why is it on computers?
Touch screen monitors are a thing, you know
:P
yeah, even the creators they it's a Tablet OS ... but unfortunetly THEY DON'ÄT MARKET IT LIKE ONE!
yeah
Barbetos, I'll learn, eventually XD
it's not exclusively for computers, though
Must be expensive as hell. o_o
I haven't seen a single ad for W8, just for creating content for it
so I can't say they market it to me
Well that was very different Lil_B
So is bronystate down?
Dad downloaded Debian I think, and accidentally got the touchscreen version
terrible experience
none of us have used Linux for--ages and ages, so all the things we knew were hard to do, and all the new things on that distro was confusing
AdamTheDuck I know, very Japanese, and I still have to get the Mastering right :/
we weren't able to login as superuser either <,<
Vivix: are you sure that was debian..
not at all sure
but it was a touchscreen version of a linux distro
Lil_B, that would be first I've heard of traditional Japanese music, very interesting.
Oh yeah that reminds me. When there was talk of keyboard and mouse being phased out I laughed
Who ever started that topic does not play games
http://youtu.be/Ox6H20zMo8U
well not only games
I don't care about that part, even if it would suck
Hahahaha. Phasing out the keyboard and mouse.
but WORK with a touchscreen would be HORRIBLE
I don't know any touchscreen linux distros with the exception of android :/
AdamTheDuck well... what I think is traditional Japanese anyway :P I only heard 2 songs I think that were 100% japanese Essemble
I don't know what it was exactly, but I think it was a light version of Debian
Do they REALLY think that touchscreens are the future?
Probably not, but you know, marketing
Pffft. Gimmicks.
a work environment such as programmers and offices, really do not benefit from touchscreen
here is my ad for touchscreens "Touch your porn."
maybe as an added simplicity, but without keyboard and mouse in addition, it's probably harder on your hands and slows your work
I can imagine it now. Some one walks in on you looking at porn, you go to close it on your touch screen and bust the thing from hitting so hard it falls over.
GREAT IDEAAAAA
hehe
When you walk in on someone, and their turn off their screen
you know it's time to leave the room
they*
Bye Vivix :<
Anymore I just leave it up and stare at the person, and continue.
!
Why should it ruin the mood?
Hehe
Oh that would be awkward
are you leaving AdamTheDuck ;_;?
ha
Oh wait, I just read the second part Vivix XD
hehehe
Okay back to windows 8
Eh, I haven't tried it, so I can't pass judgement
Good idea Phase4 XD
I haven't tried it or reada bout it
so microsoft is going the way of Star trek movies? Every other one is a good one? :)
00,02i tried it out for a bit, interface is just slow
Aah
Installed it on a work computer. Did not like it
00,02it looks shiny and colourful but transitions are slow, metro as a replacement for the start menu is slow, buttons are far apart making mouse movements slow
00,02metro also wastes a lot of screen space
I had a hard time. I really could not get along without a start menu
Which is really kind of sad when I think about it
Hm
I know the dev version is out now for the W8 app competition, maybe I should try it
Just get the OS after Windows 8, they ALWAYS need a test run before getting it right. :T
00,02it's poorly designed, and removing the start menu was the stupidest thing they could have done
I don't like tablet computers though
00,02it would have been trivial to not remove it
I thouht someone said you could reactivate it?
Like how Vista was bad, then they came out with Win 7.
00,02not to mention its still full of bugs and incompatabilities
00,02especialy with games, d3d has been locked down real hard and most games perform horribly
i hate vista that dam error tone grrrrrr
Hey totally unrelated; you can't use javascript to recognize events the browser does not catch, is there any other way to send signals from a tablet to a browser plugin or something? Like jTablet did?
I think w8 target is tiny apps and reading news-
I just haven't been exposed to news or information about it, barely even seen it-
Oh gawd wat.
Apps for Windows?
W8
look at it like windows attempt at android
Hehehe. The current trend. -_-
APPS.
00,02Vivix, nah, its windows attempt at apple
Didn't they learn their lesson from that Zune thing?
00,02and them forgetting that most of the reason windows still exists is corperate installations
00,02Ninjazz, aparently not
/me rolls his eyes.
I actually use w7 home :p
simply because it is ... reminiscent of Win xp
Hehe
00,02Ryunosuke, i'm sorry, i can't hear you over the sound of my compositing window manager
00,02:3
Maybe the contest is over, can't find it: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/apps
I just don't see W8 as an attempt at replacing W7
so I honestly never cared-
Oh btw. This is a long shot, but does anyone know how to install Win 7 onto a notebook that doesn't have a DVD/CD drive?
usb
That works?
00,02Vivix, the requirements for the windows store have been released
A friend of mine did it- with a cracked version, but it should work anyway
probably a guide online
Phase4, oh?
Facedesk. Goddamnit. That's all?!
00,02they're a little draconian and preclude a lot of existing applications
Aah
HIYA everypony
Yo
Hey Sith.
why is bronystate down?
00,02and if you want to use a managed language, say python or java, well you can't. .net or nothing
but you know, that 5000 dollar award was definitely to make a slew of simple apps
ahh-
00,02if you do it has to be packaged with your app, making it many times larger, and even then the wording is a little vague
I know most of those apps in the contest was javascript and html5-
like chrome apps
oy
why is bronystate down?
Ohai Bronysith
Noones streaming, dunno why
00,02yeah, but its a bad idea to base your apps around html when your html engine is internet explorer
00,02Bronysith, no idea
yyeah-
I mean IE9 in many cases worked better than Chrome to me during testing my code
We're being invaded again.
buut--it's still WEIRD
microsoft has a tendency to do--weird shit to ensure monopoly
I don't feel I know enough about each browser to make a call there-
00,02Vivix, lookup 'alternate data streams', something implimented in ntfs to compete with apple who has a similar but much more sane thing
00,02Vivix, also make sure you have sysinternals, just about the only microsoft application that is aware of the existance of ads is the streams utility from that
"This way, a 4GB movie could be stored in an 1kB text document"
Woah
aah
00,02a 4GB movie could be stored in a 0 byte anything
That seems and sounds impossible.
Yeah Ie sounds--
microsofty
00,02Ninjazz, google 'alternate data streams'
More techincal talk. /)>_<(\
^
/me is technonoob, but is learning
Learning is fuun
00,02Vivix, i found out about them accidentally a year ago or so, rediscovered them today while experimenting
aah sick-
I wonder how much it affects-
00,02its actually usefull, i can store different cache entries as different streams in the same file and to wipe the entire cache i can delete that one file
hm
00,02or at least it would be if it were possible to list the streams in a file
so you can store files with a eh 'clientside' language?
00,02or if the files on disk size included the streams
00,02or if ANYTHING was aware of them
i love /mlp/
00,02Bronysith, i dont know what that is but it sounds like pony
4chan ponyboard
its the 4chan board for ponies
00,02le-away-to-forchan
so what can you use ADS for? For storage of information for like... databases and stuff?
after im done browsing /mlp/ im goign to play some doom
I see html has Local DB now-
and then eat Phase4 s face
00,02D:
Not if I nom Phase4 first
:<
you fools
I've already eaten his entire existence!
Suprising enough, Ponychan and /mlp/ hate each other.
good morning bronystate!
morning, adb39
well, afternoon
Hello adb39
Hey adb39.
i have yhet to go to ponychan
afternoon :)
This thing called love. I just can't handle it.
hang on, let me change into something more comfortable
Only been to ponychan for the Desktop Ponies thread.
SPAI.
Never been to any of those
lulz
aaand
lolwut XD
why isn't it opping me...
You've been demotted. :c
You dun goofed.
Phase4, do you know Faye?
that's better
8,1even better now
HAHAHA boba fett riding rainbow dash
8,1i'm on the chat from uni, because my server is currently being moved
8,1hey ImOkayWithThis!
Anyways, if there was one thing I noticed about ponychan and /mlp/, it was that ponychan was ALOOOOOT more kinder in terms of dealing with anons.
mlp is probably 4channy and elitist
/mlp/ is still part of 4chan afterall.
"I hate ignorance" ignorant people
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_MSlvkrKPc
Vivix: 4chan generally is 4channy, yes. /mlp/ is no exception, from what I've seen.
/me 8,1is totally being productive by being on Reddit
Hehe, yeah- well, they're allowed their fun too
00,02Vivix, i dont know faye
^
Dat bother
lol-ed
I like the part when he stops moving
00,02Bronysith, its back online, not sure why it went down
Phase4 is very bored.
00,02might bother the host about it
:)
was bronystate just down?
00,02twilight_sprinkle, yeah
thats much better
something happened to the server?
oh /mlp/ how naughty you are
and thats incest...
Wincest.

Annnnnd back to one of my favourite remix'd song. :3 Looking through my dusty youtube history was a fun ride, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4xHI1qdp3s
Ah
>Don't remember A Friend In Deed

/me licks Jmo :3
Honestly.
One day.

I liked that episode
/me well I would hate being not able to hug people Jmo... :<
There's very few episodes I avoid watching
wait why did I do a /me?
but the only reason people vote for that episode IS BECAUSE OF THE SONG
I forgot the song was in
It's a good episode. The song is a plus.

i miss my old high school math teacher. he may have yelled at us with the loudness of a thousand explosion whenever we couldnt do a problem, but he was nice
Well I'm off to sleep now, goodnight everyone :P
/me hugs Jmo
bye AdamTheDuck
night
bye AdamTheDuck :)
Night Adanm
my math teacher was a shy nervous wreck who were too scared to yell at us, but SO smart, fresh out of school and very excited about explaining HOW things worked, which actually made me remember how to do math problems rather than "Just cuz thats how u do it"
