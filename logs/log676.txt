I wouldn't call this depressing, per se.
Maybe more of a thinking song.
Or maybe a song of self-relflection.
:)
why does every rpg ever have this instrument in it's soundtrack?
13sadly it's followed by a drum track
Which one?
13bit of a mood whiplash
Oh geeze
I'd say this is one of their more iconic pieces
very*
13no that's next

You mean this song fades out?
/me 13wails on her air guitar

<.<
Lasers make the best music.
I mean, part of this song have that...Toonami-ish feel...
huh
lol
...Ew...
some times it jsut needs a refresh
This song is playing nonstop on every spaceship
its still real good thats all that matters
13and then.... it just dies...
Huh..that was anti-climatic...
13ikr
13so it's still one of the best, but not the BEST
The song evolves into the credits
13it's shizumusic night i guess

If you give a jellyfish a handy, he'll want to live at home.

Ho. ly. shiiiiiiit...
Dat bass!
13this is Fiber Bundles
aww that would of been awesome to leave it unlit
except by the energy pulses
13i believe the DVD lets you isolate instruments, but not sure
Oh?
13they would have made zillions if this were an interactive program
Oh, absolutely
13i remember hearing that at the least the songs would come with alternate camera tracks
13so if you can't isolate an instrument you can at least focus on it without the camera moving around
could run this realtime
13this echo is brilliant
This is why i bought Bose headphones
Anyone here?
13now for mister gyroscopes basic drum loops from any given keyboard
13aka Gyro Drums
Holidays are still here~ Doing nothing is actually pretty fun :3
I did nothing productive for a whole week and loved it XD

I wish I used poster color, though. I'm using watercolor right now.
dayum
Poster color > Watercolor
There was an option that we could use either oil pastels, watercolor or poster color.
Unfortunately, I'm not really good with oil pastels and I don't have any poster color. FML
i think they staart to smell a bit burny if you use a lot if i remember correctly too
Not really, but I am interested in the history of painting.

Huh. That's odd then.
Yeah

Nah, I'll just /flushdns

Too much technical talk. 6_9

I am a noob to most things technical, giving up computers for music when I was a teen

00,02prince-dari, G1 movie is fun

Oh, it's Food For Louis, of course

Ahh, such magnificence. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EezZ0w7J7fg \:3/
Aww
my favourites are probably...mainly just pinkiepieswears
but I like some people on EQbeats, eh everfreeluna? I suck at names
EverfreeLuna and Meletric
I hate*
Hi everyone :)

"Making frands in Ponaville taday!"
aww i feel left out i no get hug :(
It's a series by Yogscast
it was a very good choice :)
oh :/ I never watched them, only know them by name :/
Feels like it's DRAAAAAAGING.
someone ping me? o.o
00,02LightTrooper105,
ok...
perhaps..
00,02LightTrooper105, totaly imagining it
lol
Gangam tits style sex tapes
yeah as soon as they go in you get 10000 views
nice title i would click it lol :P
There's..maating videos with 14 million views
http://youtu.be/wa6NfkuDTO8 Meletric, one of my favourite pony artists, even if it's just one song
They sustain me
I'm back from braekfast
breakfast*
... appearently Sounmdcloud is making a Halo 4 Remix Contest Oo
Ehh Halo 4...
MONEY!!
(sp)
That and they need to sell more xboxes
Cause lets face it, halo is the only worth while exclusive on xbox aparently.
We start out NOSTALGIAWEEN with Ghostbusters and Yu-Gi-Oh The Pyramid Of Light
Mmmm. I wouldn't credit them for it.
Eh, it won't affect me
anyone here getting halo 4
I bought ODST and played it once. I think I have Reach too.
yeah,
Windows*
Wut. Then it's a tablet OS.
Why is it on computers?
Touch screen monitors are a thing, you know
:P
yeah, even the creators they it's a Tablet OS ... but unfortunetly THEY DON'ÄT MARKET IT LIKE ONE!
yeah
it's not exclusively for computers, though
I haven't seen a single ad for W8, just for creating content for it
terrible experience
we weren't able to login as superuser either <,<
not at all sure
Oh yeah that reminds me. When there was talk of keyboard and mouse being phased out I laughed
http://youtu.be/Ox6H20zMo8U
well not only games
I don't care about that part, even if it would suck
Hahahaha. Phasing out the keyboard and mouse.
but WORK with a touchscreen would be HORRIBLE
Do they REALLY think that touchscreens are the future?
Probably not, but you know, marketing
Pffft. Gimmicks.
a work environment such as programmers and offices, really do not benefit from touchscreen
GREAT IDEAAAAA
hehe
When you walk in on someone, and their turn off their screen
you know it's time to leave the room
they*
Anymore I just leave it up and stare at the person, and continue.
!
Why should it ruin the mood?
Hehe
Oh that would be awkward
ha
hehehe
I haven't tried it or reada bout it
00,02i tried it out for a bit, interface is just slow
Aah
Installed it on a work computer. Did not like it
I had a hard time. I really could not get along without a start menu
Which is really kind of sad when I think about it
Hm
I know the dev version is out now for the W8 app competition, maybe I should try it
00,02it's poorly designed, and removing the start menu was the stupidest thing they could have done
I don't like tablet computers though
00,02it would have been trivial to not remove it
I thouht someone said you could reactivate it?
Like how Vista was bad, then they came out with Win 7.
00,02not to mention its still full of bugs and incompatabilities
00,02especialy with games, d3d has been locked down real hard and most games perform horribly
Hey totally unrelated; you can't use javascript to recognize events the browser does not catch, is there any other way to send signals from a tablet to a browser plugin or something? Like jTablet did?
I think w8 target is tiny apps and reading news-
I just haven't been exposed to news or information about it, barely even seen it-
Oh gawd wat.
W8
Hehehe. The current trend. -_-
APPS.
00,02Ninjazz, aparently not
/me rolls his eyes.
I actually use w7 home :p
simply because it is ... reminiscent of Win xp
Hehe
00,02Ryunosuke, i'm sorry, i can't hear you over the sound of my compositing window manager
00,02:3
Maybe the contest is over, can't find it: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/apps
I just don't see W8 as an attempt at replacing W7
That works?
A friend of mine did it- with a cracked version, but it should work anyway
probably a guide online
Facedesk. Goddamnit. That's all?!
00,02they're a little draconian and preclude a lot of existing applications
Aah
HIYA everypony
Yo
00,02and if you want to use a managed language, say python or java, well you can't. .net or nothing
but you know, that 5000 dollar award was definitely to make a slew of simple apps
ahh-
I know most of those apps in the contest was javascript and html5-
oy
Noones streaming, dunno why
00,02Bronysith, no idea
yyeah-
We're being invaded again.
buut--it's still WEIRD
I don't feel I know enough about each browser to make a call there-
"This way, a 4GB movie could be stored in an 1kB text document"
Woah
aah
Yeah Ie sounds--
microsofty
More techincal talk. /)>_<(\

/me is technonoob, but is learning
Learning is fuun
aah sick-
hm
00,02or at least it would be if it were possible to list the streams in a file
00,02or if the files on disk size included the streams
00,02or if ANYTHING was aware of them
4chan ponyboard
its the 4chan board for ponies
00,02le-away-to-forchan
I see html has Local DB now-
00,02D:

and of course a friend in deed is a pony episode
A friend in deed?
Whats wrong with a friend in deed?
I don't remeber tat epsiode
the only reason people pick that episode is for the song
>Don't remember A Friend In Deed
Rarity is my fav pony, but that is my favorite ep for the adventure
I've watched the episodes too many times to have an actual favorite.
Except more Mare Do Well, just plain don't like that one.
:) :P
maybe*
Honestly.
One day.
Jmoooooo~~
Na, I'll just torture you with something you hate.

I dunno, you tell me.
oh
http://youtu.be/p1QmvFD-lOo seen live, woo
that epsiode?
its not a bad epsiode
I liked that episode
There's very few episodes I avoid watching
wait why did I do a /me?
but the only reason people vote for that episode IS BECAUSE OF THE SONG
I forgot the song was in
It's a good episode. The song is a plus.
Sylands Hest
applejack needs another episode, she only has 1 in the entire series while everypony else has 3 per season
Hehe
would be fun to get to know her more
