I agree, Rarity is Best Pony

13she's forcing an intervention on my computer time right now
nah i doubt it's anyone from bleach or anything other than something pretty old
Celestia is the best. She can run circles around Applejack.
Nuuuuuu, Fluttershy is best!
15you are in school right?
Twilight
13(which, I may add, my father doesn't fully support since he does the same thing from time to time)

Yeah
i wouldn't be all about vengeance though

Take me away, horn!
She should, Leika, she IS the element of Marshmellow!
/me 11puts on his transmission lenses. "Time to go. Have fun everypony."

Just laugh Dee!

There you go!
As Pinkie Pie says, you must "giggle at the ghosties." Or something.
CogWeaver: Is it a non-newtonian sauce?
Studio Deen made this too?
15or is it not financially logical, sorta like my situation (5 minutes from campus)
iirc yeah
i guess they only learned how to draw 1 look
That's Rarity's turf!
it's common
No, it sounded like he was trying to get a free meal off of someone to be honest.
just checked Wikipedia since it's such a reliable source of info, and yeah, it says Deen made both
Newton despised alcohol
i thought they needed money for the payphone
hi, Pinkie
i would beat her up later
No, he didn't say he was from Papa John's, he said he was there FOR Papa John's Pizza

Oh, still
Dee: oohhh.
what's streaming?
anyway i guess that's where i stop watching.. man i hate fanservicey shows

As Lily would say "The Horror, The Horror"
This looks interesting
but wouldn't that hurt her, like tinkerbell?

Well.. I guess that makes sense. But isn't magic everywhere?
and I'm pretty sure that they don't have magic, and no pony here would want those guys here at all
Don't hit it too hard! You might hurt yourself!
... Now I'm worried again
*they don't have /useable/ magic
They have TECHNOLOGY!
YES

*something
oh you mean like magnets?
night Luna
How do they work anyway?
http://recycletiger.deviantart.com/art/10-ways-of-flirting-meme-257201710
I think magic is the answer
no, like electricity and motors and light-bulbs and non-magical things
Awww arent they adorable together?
with, even
D:
That was more of a metaphorical thing Leika
Metaphorical?
Rarity has some good designs but she doesn't have the acclaim that other designers do
I may have been a bit too rude though,
Spur of the moment thing. Heh.
ya
I think you might have hurt her feelings there
Sometimes I think I don't care.
Eeeevil!
...Celestia forbid THAT from ever happening...
9.9
I dont WANT to be like that... it just scares me
good night
Night night!
Good night Cogweaver. I hope to see you soon
MacGyver did't have a meta story though.
How does she DO that?
whatever that means
like this, Leika
No overarching story.
what's a meta story?
oh ok
/me sits like Lyra...with the help of a few braces he built*
Practice. She is a lyricist after all
Story line that carrys over from ep to ep.
erg...ow...like...ow...this
^
see...? ow...
lyricist? lyrecist?
each ep was a standalone.
Metastories are also known as arcs.
/me stops sitting that way* yeah, just a tad
you sure? i kinda remember there being something
anyhoo, goodnight for realz
Night night! Again!
It's kind of alluring though
When was this made?
Kinda Nittany_Tiger_ but that is more for when the story cant be told in one ep. meta is more for when you still have the stand alone story then the bigger story.
if you're sure about that then well ok
not that it needed it really
K

or should I say, LIEka
/me leaves*
They are NOT lies!
lie
^_^
Sure I read a lot books on conspiracies, but that doesn't mean I'm making this up!
/me cringes at that name
I'M NOT CRAZY! D:<
Sooo... night!
Good night!
pff sure
We're not saying you are Leika. Don't throw a fuss
Cog's saying I'm crazy! ;_;
/me lurking
Talk about a nice memory to carry.
Well, The power is back on
no its not
Hey, SleepWeaver
/me nudges SleepWeaver toward the PMs
?
mind if I send you something to read for me?
sure, go ahead
PM it or Gchat it
either way
Bitten? I... don't follow
Hand wave the accent
Um.. No. I'm not... strictly speaking, a pony...
Hello!
A pony is wolfs clothing?
yeah..that's me.
That's an odd thing to say when you first enter a room o.o
/me shakes her head
It is strange first words, but it works in any situation.
Bye bon!
Hello, ponies.
How is everypony tonight?
fluttershy is a pony in pegasus' clothing
I still don't really follow on "needs to be bitten"
good and urself?
I do wear a scarf a LOT... That unicorn insists... she says it gives contrast to my haunch...
But you said you mostly think like a pony. That would make you a pony in wolf's skin. . .
I'm in a Mortal Kombat and Pony mood. An odd mix.
Working, but well otherwise.
We're all animals. /discussion
Sometimes... some ponies get, well, a little out of hand? Or Stupid? Or even... bad?
And well, a little nip once in a while, makes them listen up. Just a little.
:p
I could see it
Or laugh him into submission.
See ya, Nittany
Night Nittany_Tiger_
Night Nittany
Eh?
/me growls. "Especially that Trixie."
He just has this look on his face like he's going "Duurr?"
it
lol
...
and that's it
The one-hit-KO-stare
she'll tell you you're not being nice while looking all pathetic and cute
heh
FLuttershy?
She's nothing like... like... Oh, well... not that's there's any hope there.
lol
Good night.
You win if they are facing you.
She's going to be one of those characters that has Freinds pop out of no-where and pown the enemy
So..AJ would be the biggest threat?
Angel would probably end up fighting in her stead >.>
^
Suer one: Angel with a machete
She'll probably summon animals to do her attacks.
The stare
No, Fluttershy wouldn't have her animals fight for her.
Not really
They would actually come in her defense I believe
ranged would probably be something involving birds or butterflies
Fluttershy'd just be sitting there
she would be to worried about her animal friends getting hurt
RUnning away
Well that's my opinon, take it or leave it.
I just can't see her actually hurting anything.
she'd all be NO! don't do it
A stern telling-off, sure.
and they'd just ognpore her
Eh, drama..
lol
My money says there's a Spike move in there
heh
I can't wait to see Luna and Trixie.
lol
*cough*
I could see Rarity using Spike as a weapon
Actually, I think we can dafely rule out a Spike character, simply because of rrity
yerp
Anyhow, I know I don't fit in at times, but I guess I'm not really meant to...
Though if Luna is in it, does that mean Celestia could be? O.o
unless they were going to guve him a special "Fighting rarity" moveset
That'd be an...interesting fighter.
iknowdatfeelbro
Sends you to the moon!
If Spike is a fighter, or appears at all, he needs to appear at some point in his super-macho-hero form.
do you like mmmmbananas?
LOL leika
damn u lordly! i was gonna say that
/me trollfaces
lol
Macho-Spike would be great.
/me raeg
My name is..?
A finisher for Rarity.
KIIIIIIIIIIISS?
ARRRGH!
Heh....He shows up to defend Rarity while riding Twilight.
I hopr some of the characters have a custom win quote when beating certain other characters
Hey all
Nyess pants?
http://oi52.tinypic.com/2vrzzg8.jpg
I hate being ill.
Good? Bad?
Rarity'd just summon a horde of admiters who'd trampole the enemy
/me wants tagging or strikers like in kof
no comment
I.. I can't help it... I... I... it's totally improper... not proper to the Pack... not proper to... to..
/me keeps nommin' her rabbit food
wut?
/me hides his head beneath his paws.
Rarity's finisher is dressing the opponent in frilly dresses! It's SUPER-EFFECTIVE against Applejack!
carrots
oooooooooh
Actually, that'd be fun
lol
Special Move: Makeover.
Lordlyhour: by "admirers" do you mean those ponies that pulled the apple-carridge?
Yup
I had a strange craving for veggies
Heh
You guys, that's way to complicated.
It's... bad. But that's how it's supposed to be to make it good
xP
I don't see why Schitzo!pinkie would make an appearance
Sidestroke: Do you think my text is okay?
She's doesn't really do much
The mane 6 at least have multiple skins.
It's not proper for a pony, much less the last wold in Equestria...
I'm looking for really infuriating text.
Not sure if the rest of the chars do.
I...
I,...
The alternate skins are just for multiplayer fights though
?
woo?
Doesn't matter
As is tradition
Because it'd get confusing if everycharacter was the same colorwhe you werefighting
lol
If you don't want to talk about it..
Leika: that would require different sprites entierly
not just a different skin.
It'd be making a different character.
Rather than just a recolor
/me brohoofs Lordlyhour
/me Broohoofs back
Perhaps "tiger and bunny" next.
When I'm typing I don't actually look at the screen
I do that somethimes
On the topic of Fluttershy, and because I'm watching Mortal Kombat vids: http://s608.photobucket.com/albums/tt170/Paradox043/?action=view&current=1312660026omny87_flutterscorpio.jpg

I came at the right time.
lol
Heh.
OH SHI--
hah
OMG YE
Only third episode.
We're all screwed now.
MrMooMoo! I looked, Apparently Barley Stalk already has a fanon name.
She's... an Element. WAY out of my league.
uh oh!
laughhhh
Gotta use dem superballs.
I must have it!
brb
Nuup
Everything is fine far as I can see dude
Nothing more than usual
this show makes a ton of jokes.. but mostly casual ones that aren't exactly for lols
I honestly can't imagine a sillier crush.
as far as I know, everything is fine
(Colgate doesn't know too much)
wait, why don't I know too much? :O
*officer
We are.
Alrighty
irc seems fine. /shrug
Oh, yeah
Zap. :D
I heard that too
?
we have geekshed admins hanging out here
I haven't heard about that hand on
us mods didn't hear that...
alrighty
/me sighs. "But,, i guess crushes are like that... silly?"
i wont worry about it then!
I figured it was bleh anyway
Stab whoever you heard it from
No, the guys over in #brony got a little sore about something and moved.
SunnySunshine or something.
Nobody's banning anything.
And me
Move where, the moon?
x____x
nah its alright
if anything happens though let me know and i'll move it over
seems fine right now!
Mines.... Probably... Cereal
HotCocoa: definitely not
Yeah I know.
HotCocoa try it.
I haven't seen any problems with Geekshed since the netsplits have stablized.
Wait, they stablized?
Like, for long-term?
I haven't noticed a netsplit for a while
Probably.
pfff
/me = AtomicBrony
i never did like my voice
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/27484?search=Seth
:O
/me = made of pony.
I think most people dislike their own voices.
/me omnoms
I've sounded like I was 30 since age 10.
/me is not for eating.
Cereal was inside Retsamoreh?
/me drinks MrMooMoo then.
0.o
I've sounded like i was fourteen since age 5
-____-
...at least you didn't say "warpped in socks."
*wrapped
Maybe...
SOCKS?!
/me wraps rarity in socks
"warpped in socks"
/me NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOs.
You would tasted good melted.
/me wraps Rarity in a fashionable shrug
I thought it was awesome
its pretty awesome!
sorry multitasking
Pantsshy: sibsy.deviantart.com
i can ask her to come back one day and do a formal QA perhaps
I guess it's like, well, the ponies are my pack. I protect my pack. Mostly by biting, but well, ponies aren't very good at biting...
Nerd points? Through the roof
Yeah, she showed up and everyone was, "OMG SIBSY!"
I saw her first!
Oh I forgot to mention.
And I was debating saying anything until she said it was okay.
Today is Rainbow dash day now.
Night
*peace
;P
Thats because she didn;t like you
Also: You people ttly missed it.
Yeah, it was pretty hard to mod when Sibsy came in.
And her... I'd bite CELESTIA for her. Um. If I had to, Which I won't want to do. Because she's Celestia... and anyhow I kind of more deal with Luna-- I mean, she's the moon?\
!hug
Hugtiem? :3
Thanks for the awesome news site ^/^
!lullaby
And wolves and the Moon...
night all
Count cows!
*night everypony
oh, i plan to moomoo
Solo, she is incredibly busy most of the time
i am derp
How did you guys know it was actually sibsy
Fireant~~~
rather than an imposter?
Well, time for this silly pony to sleep, nighty night folks!
Lordlyhour: she verified it.
We have our information on that
nn Leika
How?
/me knows sibsy personally :p
^
^
I had GOOD questions!
or, "WHO IS BEST PONI" for the 100th time
I like mon.
Lets not start cap spam
Moon.
I want to be a moon. Sometimes.
Octavia~~~
YEAH, CA*shot*
Alright, i gotta head out! see yahs!
Hey Fireant
/me yawns and nibbles a sammich
/me drink HotCocoa
Well that was fun.
Um.. am I hgearing a crazy pony?
I've been easing myself in to the fandom.
Most likely.
coolstorybro
I bit my tongue once. It hurt.
I do it allot with braces.
Yeah huh.
then it'll never happen again
But I believe the mouth has the fastest ability to heal.
Or something.
Sockwear: Eyes.
the image for saigonshy
More random, nonsensical, vulgar gibberish than anything, actually.

Da na na nana...

Don't WANT to.
?
.. But I just did it.
..
The more you know
Yes. Yes I can
Nah, that's Da na nana.
you touched me in my vagina
I bit the inside of my cheek once. It hurt.
http://millionthreason.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/phonesrang.jpg?w=215
Also, I was dissapointed that there is no "Octavia" category search. :(
I..may have been raised by ponies, but I kow of Wolven dignity. That that does NOT qualify.
PFF THIS SHOW IS FOR LITTLE GIRLS. STUPID BROWNIES
gurren lagann in the middle
Even though that's where she comes from.
I bit the inside of my cheek before.
Agreed.
gurren lagann is the most best awesomeist
Got herpes? We do too!
You know how those two are.
It hurt more then the time I broke my entire hand with a tractor.
@Zorotokon: IKR!?
brb
Yeah.
Luna, too.
Srsyl Pantsshy, it just wouldn't stop hurting.
It was like I tore the entire inside cheek off.
but it was just a nip!
Out of curiosity- whgat theb hay is this?
прывітанне
I figure if I fill the cavity with sugar, it'll be solid again and stop hurting
тое, што вы кажаце
I naturally gravitate toward being a night owl for whatever reason.

That would work.
!plot
*wigglewiggle*
Well see. I've got this voice for Luna in my head. That's the only thing I'm scared they'll ruin.
гэта залежыць
Вы bronie?
калі так, то смактаць
:p
They're going to kill a lot of fanon
Has Spike ever sung, or has it always just been ponies?
tabitha is a pro
ON THE MOOOOOOOONONNNNNNNNNNN
13lol
I belive Spike sang before.
Everything causes nerdrage.
BEEEEYEEEEETCHHHH
mmmmmbananas
13He'll be back I'm sure. lol
I remember there being some shots of him with a microphone.
nerdrage causes nerdrage
*Celestia looks at her CMark*
WTF?
:/
Sockwear_Moon: that's from him announcing the fashion show, I believe
Celestia should have been looking at Luna, nestled under her wing, reading the letter aloud to her.
Yeah. He announced during the Fall Winter Friends.
Was it? Drat.
Er,
Fall something friends.
No need to worry, he is done!
He comes back-- I just might bite.
Weather
He and Pinkie did announcing. And I think he did it briefly during Rarity's show.
Fall weather friends and Suited for success
I guess he never sang.
WHOA!
Probably too girly.
/me is not useful anymore
Low, mellow voice.
Oh, thanks
OMFG.
everypony is providing episode refs before me
For rarity
only 100X? he's already friggin strong
Xiagu: you've been replaced by a hjorde of noobs.
Hunh.. I could do that.
reminds me of moldiver
Pantsshy, :(
/me ain't a noob...
MrMooMoo: Nooo! no, just like, a line or two.
Pantsshy, at least it's a hjord. Is that something like a fjord?
It is required.
G"night
And it must be about socks.
In fact, she must wear socks while singing about socks.
Spike: "OOOOOOH YEAAAAAH"
lol
It's certainly intersting.. wierd as all tail but interesti9ng.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttnPs_3jDhI
Sockwear_Moon, EqAD please, if you're going to talk like that
Like a chorus
Wat?
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttnPs_3jDhI
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
.....
Pantsshy :P
Azure_CoalSpark
I was making a reference to a fic. :P
And.. I never knew clothing could make someone look.. LESS dressed...
Because it had something something but it didn't have luna.
o0
ice ice navy
lol like hour man?
Where I totally stole my name from.
actually, I'll be honest....the show could do with LESS singing
Shamelessly.
but only 5 minutes
Marshmellon?
Tux_Otaku: Go watch some other show, then.
MrMooMoo: SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
It is part of the show.
I'll get BANNED!
/me 's favorite song in the show is Winter Wrap-up
Gross.
suzaku
I eat marshmellows!
Gah, crap, now I have winter wrap-up stuck in my head.
Tuxrug, the singing is one of the best parts.
I don't hate it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UqDEGoQM1w
We need more Rainbow Dash singing?
.
There's actually a few consecutive frames in WWU that make it epicly awesome
Has Dash had her own song yet?
I wish Rainbow's singing sounded more like her normal voice
No.
/me slaps MeteorVenture around a bit with a large trout
That was horrible.
*ba dum tiss*
I can't see ANYTHING.
meh, close enough
/me bricks MeteorVenture
lol
Dangit TuxRug.
I wish Applejack and Pinkie Pie's singing didn't sound like RD's singing.
?
you pinged me.
yea Rainbow's singing voice is a little TOO tomboyish, the first time i heard it, it was pretty jarring
/me is at the ready to deliver rimshots when needed.
...
ponies and ponies and ponies and ponies and ponies and ponies and ponies
I like it.
I can't get it out of my head
Ponies EVERYWHERE
Solo: I checked how long you've been in here
/me makes a sweeping motion with his hand.
ITS RAINING PONIES
CEO with the shows exposision.
I don't know how it calms YOU down, but it makes my heart explode from the cuteness overload.
Hallehlugheioewihsgljndsdf Fuck spelling fail
TuxRug: and?
Azure_CoalSpark: hallelujah?
dang that brick thing was a great setup.. i can't make it work though
HALLELUGH

i wouldn't mind an extended verion of fluttershy's lullaby
*version
I prefer Sweeite Belle's lullaby, honestly. XD
TuxRug: I signed on about 7 hours ago.
Mason_Trowel: You respect aretha-franklin style signing, eh?
Alright, time for my paperwork. I'll be back later, folks.
Singing. jeez.

And Azure_CoalSpark: I agree.
i smell a cher
I was just curious, that's why I clicked info
This just got disturbing.
but it sticks there, and doesn't go away!
....well, alright then. Heh.
TUXRUG: WHY DID YOU BRING THIS CRAP INFORMATION UP?
*sense
Blegh
*/)^3^(\AWESUM
Pantsshy: because solo's bugging me about a ping
i've found that you can effectively deal with a crush.. by quitting thinking about it and avoiding those people
He did it on accident
He mentione that somebody had A solo in a song
brb i need to make dafodil sammich
Why didn't he just say that?
It inadvertently pinged solo
/me just goes off and dies.
Lol.
Have fun.
That's the ping? I thought he was talking about something that happened when I clicked info.

FlutterFire
definitely FlutterFire
All three CMC as one character. Nice idea.
I"m looking for something with an "N" in it
or maybe FireShy
I guess I'm just a fancub.
2^
To make SpitShyNe
I guess the only problem is that you'd have to be smacking little children around.
lol Pantsshy
wut
TugRux: wat
/me picks up Fluttershy
Fluttershy automatically wins all fights because at the mere thought of harming Fluttershy the opponent breaks out into tears.
…
/me equips Fluttershy
this anime just got alot more interesting
And that would be awesome.
Sockwear_moon: are you Apple Cider or Chef Sande?
WTF, Pantsshy!
wat?
Which one.
Neither? I confus
*sandy
Although Trixie sometimes makes me want to kick something.
/me gently kicks a vase, and it wobbles.
Sockwear isn't either of the people from Bronyville podcast, methinks.
I could use my udder cannons to wet her.
Cyril ships Twixie.
It's official.
^ made that up
Ugh
^Duh
...
At the first one
Ok, over proud much?
Geez, Ninjas.
Her "Grin" sound.
oh lol
BATTLE--
START!
^ squeak
OMFG yes!
She could replace chancey in the pokecenter
Pantsshy, oh shit
Fluttershy is the boss.
Pantsshy, DO WANT
I can't wait to play as Trixie. Or even beat on Trixie. Either/or.
And again, 10 million flutershys. Becaue i LIKE it.
resetting stream.
Hey dawg
or this noise http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZkv9cTQ2Mg
back up
How do you "trixie"?
no pony loves trixie as much as trixie loves trixie
/me hides his head under his paws again. "I just said that out loud, didn' I?"
I bet Trixie's blanket has a picture of Trixie on it.
This is called Steliva of the universe
ya i know.. i wouldn't want more than 1
Hi guys
In Gollum's voice: "I told you she was..."Trixie"...
Hi Barry
hi again, Barry :P
:P
Mason_Trowel:.... nice
More than 1 of me would be interesting.
Barry? I have not met a barry?
/me is still waiting for ballad
Poorly I would guess
And Barry, no idea, but after the things I've heard about the last one..
lol barry i would watch it
Depends, if they make it live-action I can see it being another "So Bad It's Good" deal
Then again, I doubt Barry has met me...
A Metroid movie.
>.>
oh ya that'd be awesome
But there is not nearly enough Trixie in my image folder.
Did the author die?
nah i won't own a 3DS but hey that'd still be cool
You know, I still don't have a "Pony" folder...
Hmm...
Me neither
Me neither
Yeah, I've got it saved to my Pony folder.
i just got done playing earthbound zero for the first time like yesterday
Hey guys

but it was harder than the usual fare

Huh?
At that link.
You mean gameplay wise or plot wise?
Plotwise
Really?

I agree with Spose

The shaved Llama. Wat.

I'm Ayaku, and I've never seen you before.

MrMooMoo: they can't catch them.
Heh.
People eat dogs...
Dogs are stupid
inb4 tinkerbell turns on wendy
and not good for much else
people eat food
And easy to catch
Such good memories.
Cats are hard to catch, full of gristle, boundless utility...
Vietnamese eat cats.
Why do people eat cows?
WHY
MrMooMoo: THEY ARE EASY TO CATCH.
because cows are full of yummy meat
(No.)
they're like pinyatas filled with meat
You hit them with a stick and steaks fall out?
/me hides
Lolololol
They could drink my milk.
... :O
Because, you know...
They're not.
I'm having a hard time rejoining this conversation while staying PG.
I think somthing with a bit more action is in order. hope you all don't mind the not sticking to one show.
Oh it's fine.
In the future yes.
they're probably weened since they can talk
I'm fine with that too :P
Supposedly more of the Mane 6's families are gonna show up in season two. Word of Sibsy. ^_^
Oh
SHOW up/
I thought you said "GROW up.
"More of their families Grow up! The mane six stay the same age, though"
>:V
Lol
Hello.
yes
Now this is something I can get into.
I have not seen this.

That means it's the laughing man, right? I can't remember.

How do you do that thing where you bold a name to make the beep?
You type out the users name
It bolds the name only on the receiving person's end.
Like this: Spose

/me is crying now
I have them both on the psp now but well ponies has taken up most my free time.
but my brother beat it anyway
Star ocean
/me is no-longer crying
Guise?
we only played the first 1
Now it's time for vengeance?
the pst one was the second one, the first one was only released here in the US last year.
Yeah, but I think Guise would be a cool name to go by.
er ps2
Just wait here
dis guise ^_^
/me walks off into his room
*tests the waters* Hello?
hello Aellos
Hi there. Welcome.
Hello :D
oh cool :D
O_O
PS2.. I remember hearing about Star Ocean, I just don't know if I've ever played it.
It reminds me of my Roke's name.
Hi scallywag
Hello scallywag
hey
sorry Aellos
L.O.
heya scallywag
Lol, continue Wockstar :D
now Solo
Aellos
Lol, I just noticed the 'ponychats' button next to the page and went "hmmm"
F.U.N.E.X?
where do you want to be stabbed first?
Legend of Dragoon!
with these machines around
Sorry, stupid netbook keyboard. Aellos: Good crowd here. You should fit right in.
i need to play that
Awesome. :D
I was hesitant to hop on here since the last time I joined a community on IRC it did not end well. :P
I've noticed that.
in fact i might play that really soon after earthbound
Wockstar: Aim for my squeedly-spooch. It's in that jar over there.
and the combo attacks.
you need to play legend of legaia
ok
Spose: Yeah. Pretty much.
That button is shovelled in with banners as far as inattentive perception goes
I still reacall that one purple chicks "DIE MORE AND MORE!" line
/me stabs Solo's squeechie-squooch
Best motto evar
/me dodges.
damn
http://www.emuparadise.me/fup/up/37096-Legend_of_Legaia_(ccd)-2.jpg
ooh
I told you to aim at the squeedly-spooch, not my squeechie. I need that.
/me pulls out gun and shoots squeeshie-squooch
I want to say that to someone sometime
oh
sorry
/me dodges.
i does...
Pff, there is no such thing as murder.
/me starts crying again
I can fix that.
Ponies don't die, what're you talking about
/me removes Wockstar's tear ducts. Nothing bad could come of that!
There is murder. But only for fish.
not a very well hidden sniper perch.
/me dies
NO
As shown in Winter Wrap Up
THAT NEVER HAPPENED
NONONONONO
Idk y but this conversation is making me want to turn Dr. Kevorkian into a pony pun but it isnt working
http://us.playstation.com/Content/OGS/SCUS-94254/Site/media/group_tree.jpg
Poor fishies.
there ya go.. legend of legaia!
And then I kind of got scared and hid.
Well, you'd be doing most the talking.
Omg, I forgot to read Cross and Arrow part 9
!moon
Grab my tail, Spose!

I also don't really have the desire to read that fic for some reason.
Wat?!
*snicker*
Really now?
hehehe

Lol that was strannnge
User_9129: type !moon to grab Derpy's tail and get kicked out of the chatroom

Mmmmdelicious.
Derpy is a minx.

O_o
Yes, Derpybot has some, interesting commands...
!makeout
/me gives Solo a searching look and then flies off to #EquestriaAfterDark

yes
Must have been fun to program her.
Thank you!!

Lunar Republic?
Is best republic.
I am a proud member of the Lunar Republic
Hmm okay *runs after*
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0tYs5U5RI
Did't think he would sell it.
Twilight's Book Club is best club.
I like this song too,
I agree that that's a good song
Luna pony is best pony.
not unexpected
I know.. but 1 grand?
Sad song
Neigh
and I consider that costume creepy. The joints are all wrong.
I knowyourmeme-ed it and didn't find anything lol
But awesome song
would be hard to wear it if they went the right way =p
Ahhh okay
But the right way is the only right way!
ahhhh memebase
I think I watched the entire first season on the day I saw the pilot after saying to myself, 'Just one wouldn't hurt.'
I just hope it is only used as intended.
where would i be without you?
Outside?
Okay...this song...too awesome
No
I know. I can listen to it all day. And I have before.
This really is a good song
Aellos: The show is good, but not, in and of itself, truly amazing. What's amazing is the fans.
damn backspace
eeeeee-yup
0ew.... crocs in the feet
For me I loved the show, but I didnt really fangasm tell after running into the "Herd" and watching some commentary videos :P
Not to mention all of the fics.
I think I've heard of both. :D
you made me think of it by filling in the outlines
Before I go, going to link this. Been on EQD before but it doesn't have nearly as many views as I think it deserves. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhk_zDhVnjc&list=PL9DD00D6DAAB22053&index=17
Oh, and a friend just linked me to this total LAWLfest.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tReXtRiW7dI&feature=youtu.be
Did you read Past Sins?
Soooooo more GITS or somthing else?
Why is that?
lol
Solo
that was
awesome
Male Twilight makes me scared.
there's 2 ways of getting a shape.. filling it in or filling in everything around it.. all i'm saying is you filled in everything around the idea
Wockstar: I know, right?
it took me long enough to explain that gosh
i like crossovers the best
I dont mind shipping (and kinda like it actually) I just dont want porn
EFFING BACKSPACE
Wockstar: Videoedit win. For real.
Solo: yea Barh
Brah*
Do you like shipping, Azure_Coalspark?
I have lots of good ship fics.
Mares and Magic?
Of Mares and Magixc
*Magic
That one, yeah.
That dragged on a bit, as I recall
haha not really offline.. just a picture of it being offline
REALLY good shipping story. Believable characters, plot development, and the best backround for Trixie I've ever read.
tricky tricky
Well, goodnight everypony. That is, unless there is more ---
brb
goodnight sotha:D
Beyond that I'm too out of it to remember names of fics.
~In this city of amnesia~
there is more
I laughed many, many times in BoTS
See ya later, both of you
On A Cross and Arrow is good too, which I'm reading right now.
YAH
cya later trollight!
^
not reading it right now, but…yeah
I should hope not.
This is macross
Soo....now I want a dystopian themed pony fanfiction...is that bad?
http://www.ebay.com/itm/110740955959 :o
Well, non-crossover
I haven't played it yet!
0help me fox!
i was going to turn off the stream but that elvish looking girl (at least had the head accessories that are usual for elvish people) intrigued me
All I have left to do are the DLC.
should've tried a somersault
In fact, just sort for Star-6.
You'll find everything.
http://necrodios.deviantart.com/art/WTG-7-MLP-Punching-is-Magic-255257327
well damn, I went to sign in here on my actual IRC client and even tho I had left the webpage it still said someone else was using my name :\
I only have a 47 or something like that. We should play sometime.
Er. . . siren
we should have a battle royalle to determine the best of the star 6's
The sequel looks good though.
determine the best of the best

I've been working on a run with some friends right now actually.
DerpyBot was faster than Twitter that time
Closest I've got is either a 61 Soldier or a 36 Sniper. :/
hey
everyone
Is't it though
hi Synros
Hi Synros
I never really could get into make ur own fun games :\
i actually like that
i really hate the service provided Vonage.
take that purple haired girl with you.. she seems like ownage
1 exception being forge on halo
i could never work forge
0did that say ASS-1?
Pacific
i would just fail
yes the ass1
You?
Eastern
That's not too bad then.
Easier to co-ordinate than transatlantic.
FOKER!
i just spawn tanks on people
But then I wouldn't want you to not have fun because you die really easily. . .
but i just cant replace optimus prime
i just cant...
Siren. She's in the 40's, or something.
sadly...
Okay, power leveling a character isn't too hard it's getting some decent weapons for the level once you get there that can be the trick.
Cloptimus Prime
haha yes
Ponimus Prime
I dont even
Pinkie Prime?
well
i have alot of awesome pinkie pictures
actually, i have awesome pictures of everything
but cmon, its optimus prime
question...what anime is this?
macross Zero
How about... Optimus Prime -and- ponies?
how about optimus holding a pony?
Borderlands
or how bout this
http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&global=1&q=pony+transformers#/d2v5vcc
The Hellfire.
Optimus with Applejack on his shoulder?
alright thanks
lol
i actually made a picture where optimus prime has applejack on his shoulder
that would be awesome
but still
http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Maliwan_Hellfire
its not as awesome as just optimus prime
That's a nice one.
she touched his spear
well..
i might replace it if i find a picture where it has applejack or pinkie pie using optimus primes jetpack
TO THE INTERNETS!

^I approve of this Trixie
:D
/me <3 Trixie
You have XBOX?
Oh, hello, Darkmemories :)
Oh really?
No.
Yeah.
You on Xbox?
Yeah. Oh well then.
Well there goes that plan.
Probably should have checked that first. :/
she's totally got a point and owned
Yeah. Whatever. It was still fun talking with you.
Dumb XBOX Live.
Yup.
o hai
There.
Done with cross and arrow.
Yes and othere games are doing it now too.
<3 ps3
Xbox has had a few, but nothing that I can think of lately.
Eh. I fell out of habit of playing TF2.
Mostly because the community.
I know Shadowrun and Universe at War both allowed cross platform play.
{SU?
PSU?
Spose: The communiy is largely diamonds now (bronies)
i got a PS3 but really i use it mostly for going online to watch anime anyway
Its called TEAM Fortress 2, meaning people should play as a team.
I don't care if people yell hats the entire time
Phanisty Star universe
It annoys me when I have 4 people on my team that are spies/snipers
Oh
those AAA games are extremely disappointing for the most part
Dont care how good you are. Team doesn't need it.
And yeah, the lack of teamwork is annoying sometimes
PSU?
And common sense, for that matter.
dude
me too
No problem.
woah owah, wait a seconds. did this anime just turn into Transformers?~?
How long have you been asleep?
I think it did...
...and it might be a problem with how you sleep, usually airway passages blocked or not entirely open.
dunno, for about 8 hours
That's macross for you.
i always have the weirdest of dreams
Well, goodnight everypony! (again)
I wish I could even dream.
Anyone here dreamed of ponies before?
But then again, i haven't slept for more than four hours consecutive for a few weeks now.
9.9
Whenever I spend a night on ponies, I always dream about Scrubs for some reason.
-_-
its me again!
&Fireant
:P
Macross Missile mayhem is a TVtrope.
Geekshed, why do you blow up my client
I have college today. Should probably sleep.
sometime ago, i dreamed that i would shot the thing from blairwitch project in the face, with a grenade launcher
Wasn't expecting that.
best ganme I have for PS3 is MGS4
game*
the weird thing is, i havent seen that movie in years
MGS4 was horrible!
i just like the visuals
And teacher would reply
it was more of a moviue then vg
MGS4 has no gaemz!
good deal
"Oh sure, I did the same but wake up earlier to clop to ponies"
arghr I hate this laptops keyboard
I bought a LE copy for $10 from Walmart on clearance. >_>
i would never ever clop to ponies
"You too?!"
They had like 12 of them on the shelf.
Heh.
I liked Mirrors Edge
Mirror's Edge was cool.
I want a sequel.
And why Luna is best pony.
*in EAD, not here
FTFY
it was normally like $60 at the time
I also want other FPS games to include the movement abilities from Mirror's Edge.
still haven't beat it yet.. kinda quit on it too
now I hate it
Well, nice talking to you all. I'm off to the moon to sleep!
!moon
Grab my tail, Spose!
Sadly I didn't get Mirror's Edge until it was around $20, but it's definitely one of my favourite games this gen.
Totally got my money's worth.
indie games are the only games that are moving forward
I know that custom levels are possible, I just haven't gotten around to it yet
I'd also try making some myself but the Unreal Editor and I don't get along too well
theres also several achievments that you have to play through a couple times to get
oh
i mean PS3 version
Which I find disappointing D:
anyone else here play and spiderweb software games?
Oh you derpy xD
hmm
!muffinkiss
too obscure but.. had to ask
Criany You can't clop to ponies?
I haven't played any Spiderweb Software games, but I have heard of them.
!plot
*wigglewiggle*
at least with avadon
i might buy it since it's only $10
i remember playing exile on a shareware CD called 1000 games (or maybe it was 100)
:D
I remember those.
I'll probably pick up Avadon at some point, just not right now. I've got too many other games on the go anyway.
i also remember castle of the winds from that CD
That's sad.
(shouldn't this be in #EquestriaAfterDark?)

thats some amazing sound design
haha you can't make me hungry this time! i just ate
ok here comes the Micheal Bay missiles
What's up?
I don't think anything's up.
That's too bad

noting goes wrong on tv unless it's supposed to go wrong.

Well, this place ain't Zolty enough for him?
Not enough zolt.
We must build additional zolts.
How does one build a zolt?
i don't even know wat is going on anymore
Man, I tab out for a second and I could've sworn I heard music from Star Wars
With zolter of course, silly.
Does it involve ponies? I hope it does.
the magic of television
Sadly, no.
also constant thrust is needed for constant movement.
I'll modify my zolter into a pony
squish
called it
wololo
that still picture reminded me of gurren lagann

I don't really mind either

Dress Tycoon
i was thinking about the word update which is probably "up to date"
As in this
lets watch some Fullmetal
Carosel Boutique Tycoon
oh LOl
i get it knpow
guys, how long are you doing that already ?
6I saw the word Fullmetal and am now interested in this conversation.
And be sure to buy the expansion including such exciting venues as Quills and Sofas!
Carosel Boutique is an expansion pack to be released at a later date
0heh bender sucks
and wae have been doing it way to long
i wanna watch Fullmetal
oh
Alch panic or jacket?
Alch
mmh
i see....
yes
6Of TV?
6...the quality is epic.
see =p
Battlepony
oh wow
nice
THE MOVIE
6...as long as you change it before Tosh.0 comes on...
this is totally acceptable quality
6Is is amazing quality.
i aprove of this streaming
RD: Pft, vehicles? I'll just fly!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tReXtRiW7dI&list=PLF308B0793AC6082B&index=32
bender is speed hacking
Bender is Neo
inb4AIMBOTTING
ok, bender is hacking\
6lol little Korean girls.
did someone link that earlier?
I did.
oh lol sorry, I musta missed that, but I found the vid last week
oh shit!
anyone hear about the Amber Alert?
ok despite me really disliking this show a couple of those jokes were really nice
i already knew it
hi fall
Hellew.
Hey dude.
hoi
Oh, I see
gonna be streaming season 2 i think
6Si.
grrr
this mac is soo slow
how can i work like that?!
/me dances
my guess is that pinkie secretly hides a unicron horn in her hair
ok guess noone did or cares?
thats why she is able to control the forces of the universe
lol probably
aside from, you know, beeing pinkie pie
pinkie can generate her own inprobability field
her special unicorn magic is defiling the fourth wall, and physics
okey dokey lokey....
Exactly!
her special unicorn magic? Pretending to be an earth pony.
that would make sense
with reeeally good intuition.
In the comic I saw it, she ended by saying "Okey Dokey, Loki!"
Hmm
theres an Amber Alert in BC right now
Adorable alert!
damn

Wow, Trixie's voice actress once played Mary
but the food i saw on pictures
lol
hour long YT movie with all kinds of mistakes
Slightly different characters there
or something
ijust noticed that now
from the under the leg shot
Is this like a "what would you do for a Klondike Bar" kinda thing?
Holas Fall
would you build equestria to live there?
good gracious! i can count to books!
I've been here since ~5am
Like pointing out the inner thigh cuty marks.
and AJ's freckles going missing
Mary had to deal with plenty of neighsayers.
yeah
build ? its hard to belive such buldings can stand
I slept
foreshadowing
Fail. Normalness fail.
ok guys
lets talk about our weirdest dreams
Does yours involve ponies?
It's to do with some of the events, Semysane.
That's it for me. Thanks for putting up with some of the poor slections and such ^_^
I was afraid you were trying to rape me
if my dreams involve ponies?
hmm
I tend to remember dreams clearly for no more than like an hour
that was weird
;-;
SOmetimes I can pull on a thread I remember and recall the whole thing
however, the dreams that dont involve ponies are even weirder for me
My dreams involve IRC. can't get any weirder then that.
I've never dreamed of ponies.
also martha speaks is awesome. agreed? y/n
That's called Season 1.
http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=kH2
Though I did have a weird dream last night where I was acting, and I was doing light saber duel choreography.
thanks for the stream btw:D
well
i had a dream
FallSilently: LOL
Thanks for streaming
where i was chased by the thing from blairwitch project
tank you
Typically mortified
It's not chess. It's a boardgame-esque thing.
the dream ended with me beeing part of a military squad blowing the things face off
sweeet
it's simple and fun.
Passes the time great too.
3 players now!
Gonna start it up in a moment.
ok, now wat do we talk about?
topics anyone/?
oh
already done
and it involved a pony...
but...
alright every pony, I g2g, work in a few hours *yawns*
well do it again!
(in sandy's voice)
Night all
well play again!
how did Spongebob get into this?
<3 phelous
by way of appliable reference
well
it was a really scary dream
actually, it wasnt
yeah, he was awesome
and a town full of zombies
whichever block you stepped on could kill you or you could progress.. you have to think about it while fighting
idk why you might think that but ya i kinda liked it.. i don't usually do card games anyway
but i find poker interesting
am i going crazy?
Night all
lol
*im
thats the weird thing
You're not? Eh, then i have no clue.
inb4 you get to the other side of the minesweeper board and then "king me"
cause you know someone was gonna bring it up
right...
you know the weirdest part?
checker sweeper
chesser sweeper
as you might have already noticed
chesser sweeper the FPS
with NUKES
part FPS part RPG part RTS
done lose...
don't
nice, well go for it
not innovative enough.. need more!
moooore!
<Joker> You wanna know how I got these scars?
lawl
also i'm not entirely sure i used innovative right
just do it.
like me with voice acting. took me a which, but I'm finally getting into it
practice practice
that as well
ya.. i don't really see how i could possibly be unsuccessful with proper effort
poniesponiesponies
Spooky~
ya but quality is also very important
if you can have it you should work for it
:p
right now i'm wondering whether i should go to college or not
that was a line from the song
its astheics and gameplay
yeah but it's atheticly soild
All I said was
poniesponiesponies
I hope there's a Roc in season 2, that would make for some interresting jokes
you can go there.. it's not a cheap background
it's actually real
ponies? we don't want no ponies in this channel
that sort of thing
and also it looks good
yeah
How absurd!
Leonon: "Dumb Roc!"
roc*
but uglier characters
lol
XD
generally speaking
I waonna Roc!
OMFG!!!!!
that was posted a while ago, he just fixed the link
And sorry for profanity
if there even is a meaning
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HeteroSym-pinkblue2.svg
i don't think i've even heard of that ever
I don't get it either
I don't get the meaning behind it either, but it doesn't bother me
I linked to the meaning to it
The cross symbol is the "female" designation, while the arrow is the "male" designation
oh
that's... stretching it imo
Well, I guess that makes sense
ponies and sexuality
bye Synros
alright take care synros
...
remember
riiiiiteee
not this again
we all know there are only two types of ponies
lol
Best pony and B3st P0ny
not really actually I f**king hate it
pinkie pie and everyone else
died on second clicks
yes FPs cheeser sweeper with nukes
Applejack and Pinkie Pie
lol the nukes you step on that kill you:P
all the other ones are equal
no hate
sufficient to set off a nuke when stepping on it
ya i got all the sonics too
All wrong
shes a zebra
Everypony > any pony else
i mean 1 2 and 3
lol
TBH I think S2 was my least favorite, actually... IDK why, it just didn't sit too well with me
'night everypony
gn8
G'night.
how is that possible?
S3&K is awesome, though
how is everyone going in napowrimo?!
i pony around all day at work
It's been a while since I played it, actually... Should do that again some day
i don't know.. but i don't think you could do the ball spin thingy in 1
ya.. that totally made me impatient
I know when I was younger S2 was the first I played
now
how many times...
does pinkie pie...
say "okey dokey lokey"?
all the times
haha
... touche...
5-6?
21
i dont have a clue myself, actually
Second one, the ruins
well, i guess, then its <Optimus> Time to find out.... </Optimus>
most of the times she says it are in ep 25, that might be the only episode she says it tbh...
Again, you talk way too much.
but.. it doesn't even look like its name
i think i had the right music playing in my head lol
lol
15 as well
http://0.tqn.com/d/nintendo/1/0/X/3/-/-/soniccolors2.jpg
I'd like to be a three :3
a three?
yeah
I think he meant tea.
and momentum-based, IMO
but i mean.. they don't even make terrible 3D games
but something about them just isn't appealing
http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=kH3
to me anyway
Join for fun etc. etc.
ya momentum is monumental
yeah XD
rush?
It is really, really fun
really fast-paced, boost button, etc.
S4 didn't have the boost, but it played more like Rush than 1, 2, or 3, for instance
it plays like YYZ on guitar hero.. starting out with morse code and having a chokeable solo
She was Sweetberry
I don't follow, I'm not much for rhythm games lol
YYZ is a song by rush
My sister used to watch that all the time
it was in GH2
/me stands and stretches her wings.
I see
Well, I'm done here. See you guys later if I feel like it.
See ya
and i think the beginning of YYZ is morse code for.. YYZ or something

Oh wow, Trixie's actress was Dot Matrix!
there's always a harder song
I KNEW I knew that voice from somewhere!
(especially cause of custom songs and songs made specifically for guitar hero)
I'm going to have to check that out later
Awesome
for now, I think it's time for me to hit the hay though
And she was the only character to never get a toy
See you later :P
aww

Speaking of live streams, we need to sort something out with the Season 2 opener for those of us stranded on the moon.
Lunasta, that's why Fireant lacks control
A little
I have to read part 10 of On a Cross and an Arrow
I wait for the next chapters religiously...

Of course, Derpy's not sentient.

Heh
Does anyone here celbrate towel day?
Ok, be right back.
huh?
I do!
Well, the first ten million years were the worst...
The multiplayer could go with a few more maps/gamemodes though
The second ten million... they were the worst too.
Awesome
lol
After that, things went into a bit of a decline.
Maybe we can see about turning it into an EQ daily event?
towel day?
Pony towels
that would be great :D
Towel day
wet towels or dry ones?
But how many towels must I bring?
by taking a towel with you everywhere
uhm
Celebrate Day Day?
It shows that you're always ready
No
and
don't panic
It gves you the appearance of always being readyu
i forgot about that
I just said that
I like panic. Panic is my favourite!
and allows you to scab anything you want from non-hitchhikers by making them you assume you lost it
long since i saw the movie, longer since the book
I just read chapter 10

why are we acting like he is luna?

If Luna was actually here, everyone would act quite differently...
THIS IS ALL HER FAULT
Played by ponies.

Desktop ponies?

Celestia is winning by 2.
Now by 1.
Now by 2 again.
Now by 1 again. This match is exciting!
Thanks for the play-by-play.
It's currently a draw at 6 all.. But Team Celestia kicks a goal!
no problems.
http://www.ustream.tv/channel/songcasts I'm about to start streaming here
Team Celestia is ahead by 2. Now by 3!
Fluttershy would be worst goalie ever.
you mean "something broke"?
hm... I've been playing with two ideas in regards of fanart.
first
Team Celestia won, by 4!
But I don't know/think I'll manage either of them by 17th
mmmh boring
actually, its not
Yup
that should be interesting
where can i watch?
I just linked
Helloo
!s2
Season 2 begins in 8d:23h:03m:38s
Pinkamena's winning by 3. Come on Pinkie.
lol
pinamena could never beat pinkie
pinkie is the superior personality
5 now.
Make that 6.
again
;D
No worries.
Pokey Pierce used to do more than pop balloons, but after a stink in prison and becoming a Registered Sex Offender, he found it to be much more legal.

damn these ponies are really intrusive :P
on the 17th
Not going to ask.
Anyway, I go.
bye
Now this
Balloons
lol
Yes?
haha
Hmmm.
I mean, WTF
Balloon phobia?
Then again I have a cockroach phobia
and I know how it feels like when people laugh at me for this

I know, that's just mean.
I'm afraid of ponies
My greatest fear
Ponies can be very scary.
causing eternal night and all that
Then I read some of the fanfiction, and the pony fear returned even stronger =(
Some fears are good
I'm afraid of spiders, and of course there's no reason NOT to be afraid of spiders.
I need to play some FF8 later...
I wouldn't want to condition myself to like and enjoy spiders
I have a bit of fear for spiders as well
Not as bad as cockroaches though
long story
Of course. they can be dangerous but you don't need a phobia of spiders to know not to touch them.
Those are gross too
I'm not afraid of spiders if I know they are harmless.
The large ones
When they have their egg sacs
And they hatch
I hate daddy longlegs, and I know those are harmless
and the baby spiders everywhere
Creepy and dangerous
i can't remember if those were in 8.. but i know they were at least in 7
I hate bugs. I don't fear them.
They're just disgusting.
My home is full of spiders apparently
Kill all bugs
Still does bother me though
If i see a spider, i put it on a piece of paper and carry it outside. Easy. No harm done to either of us.
The only ones that don't bother me, pill bugs, lady bugs, grasshoppers
Tiny ones
I use duct tape.
to be honest
Spent a whole day using a cloth and wiping them off
Killing them
wait
But argh
killing them?
Fireant
Kill spiders with socks, pieces of paper, cologne + lighter, shampoo, anything that can be used against them quickly and efficiently
i try to rescue them if i can
Don't do that again.
you listened to it?
Back in my old apartment I once encountered a centipede
He does it all the time.
My old apartment had all kinds of bugs D:
D_D
I've seen you spamming lines of it here.
unless they are huge idiots
DIE!
how did you like it?
oh
that
yeah, i already forgot about that
I killed thousands of ants using a lint roller
Ants aren't that bad
I kill them but if one touches me it doesn't really freak me out
they were when I was killing thousands of them
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf6_qDoCUu0 <---
It's fun following ants around the house as they walk their paths from nest to food
/me such a nerd
Ants?
Disgusted the Celestia out of me
I found a spider like that in my hause recently, no egg sack though
I like ants.
mako reactors were only in 7
i put a wet towel on an ant street by accident
Fireants?
the place was swarming with ants shortly afterwards because they didn't find the way anymore
There's an ant nest in my home
In the kitchen
5 minutes later
ants everywhere
SPIDERSESSSSS.
The biting kind of ants
I gave up trying to manage them and just put food in my fridge whenever possible
Cereals are especially vulnerable
Pouring cereal and seeing ants flee the bowl makes me a sad pony.
=(
Sometimes I go into the kitchen
I still havent gotten that far in 7
Then later
Anyway, AFK again for a little bit
:/
protein they use to make more ants
Can they cut into it?
I've drunk a few ants because of that
I use to get carpenter ants in my sodas
they taste like... ew.
Yeah
We should send Derpy to fix the problem.
Like I said
There's a nest in the kitchen
In the wall
The queen is probably in there
put mineral oil along the wall, they can't get across it easily
hmmm.
I'm thinking of sealing up the holes where the nest is with something
Like plaster
It's a tiled wall though
...Hm... Derpy ant exterminator. Knowing her, she'd use mousetraps...
lol
caulk the wall, put baby oil or WD40 (or another mineral oil containing thing) along the wide of the caulk
and the house would be cockroach-free after that :D
Orkin
You think if I spray some WD-40 into the holes
or if the oil absorbs into whatever it's on
Hmmm.
Probably tell him to buy some plaster or sealant or something
hello?
seems likely
hey mexican
Yeah
bugs, spiders, ants
The occasional pony.
i like spiders
occasionally.

On another note, the RD costume is bidding at 2.5K right now
does any of you know how to program in c++?
That guy's getting a nice payday

ew, oop
no, but I can learn!
I know how to break programs in C++
That's easy Leonon

i know how to stare buggy c-programs into submission
<<^^>>
I also have a theorteical degree in physics
nothing yet, first have to program the remote
that's some expensive yiffing right there
when i get there i´ll tell you
i had a second degree burn once
If you have a theoretical degree in physics, we should get some magnets around Einstein.
how do magnets work?!?!?
is it because of the great and powerfull twixie?
no
Magneta, our lesser sister, ensures that magnets work
her wings are stubby and her horn magic is weak, when compared to us pure alicorns
Trixie has no interest in magnets
lol
brb, gotta finish the program
call me if something interesting happens

/me wants to go to the gala...but Celestia said no
she doesn't want to cover the travel costs
been dreaming, i´ve been waiting, to fly with those great ponies
If you want an argument, MeteorVenture, I'd suggest 4chan.
i'm not looking to argue
now imagine it going to the moon!
I reckon that with three and half grand you'd be able to hire someone to make this kind of costume to you.
see? you'd ruin all of equestria!
Yeah, but price wars don't always make sense.
No they dont
or bidding wars, rather
perform for crowds of thousands, thell shower us with diamonds
/me is sad..."But..but...I can fly in from the moon! I don't even need any guards!"
Same thing with the Flutterplush... I mean it was pretty cool, but $600?
imagine the shame you'd bring upon equestria turning up with no escort
At certain point you get affixed of winning the other side no matter the cost even through the price would no more make any sense...

*shrug* I can disuise myself well enoguh
I think it's the same as when you start certain project and at some point hit problems, but still are determined to finish it thinking you can't turn back anymore because of the time and money you've already wasted

hey RP
how are you doing?
Even through it would be more cheaper and sensible to stop instead of continuing...
/me wants to see all the pretty dresses and all the pretty ponies..

Eh? I just thought "typical furry mindset" didn't seem like it was intended as a compliment :P

To put it simply.
10fair.
If you have something that fires a projectile.
10hm?
3.6k on that mascot suit now
And you're trying to hit something 2.5m away, how would you work out the angle needed to hit an alien?
lol
As much as they are paying for it, they could probably just get one commissioned on deviantArt
when does the stream begin today?
:P
10well, hold on
The thing you're trying to hit.
It's an alien.
Because you don't like aliens.
They're different.
10Right.
10So it's 2.5m away?
/me is sad because of people ignoring him
10and you're firing a projectile
10>run at it and beat the shit out of it ;)
10but yeah, hold on
Not projectiles
Other than aliens, the other example was they're Germans.
And we're in 1940.
10Lol.
10Or, germans, just for the sake of it
/me 10is a cunt
How would you do it?

suvat?
Well.
Theres an IRC deity today?
i also dont want to be arrested
10although, I guess you don't know the speed of the projectile yeah
fine, be picky :P
*switch
DecapMobile: lolwut?
You just have the distance, and acceleration.
10hm
wear a suit
DecapMobile: how do those word even...
stay classy
tuxedo, etc
wear two suits!
*words
two suits is ironic
10yeah ofc
three?
screw it, ill just go in my standard t-shirt and shorts
MAINSTREAM
when does it start to be ridiculous again?
Because of autocorrect
10something stupid like shoot straight up, and then time it to gauge the initial velocity?
five? ten?
Why do you need to distance yourself anyway?
it is ridiculous past 1
because i do not want to be seen as a hot topicite
lol
10XD
hm
awesome
Oh no, someone saw me enter Hot Topic D:~~
The shame!
t-shirt and shorts
not a skinny t-shirt
just a regular t-shirt
Oh, and we didn't use suvat anyway and it still worked.
whatever...
i conform with it
9guys hey guys
9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmFEXNpmCLA&t=01m06s
Well, actually suvat was used earlier to get an equation for the flight time of the projectile.
9NewDCDsbananimation.jpg
I'm at home today, called in sick to work :\
9*avi
<bicyclerepairman> absolutely nothing
I don't know if I'd wear a pony shirt.
classy, but likely to cause lawsuits
10lol, yeah I assume you don't need suvat
10um
10just trying to think >.>
10but I haven't had to /think/ in over 3 months soo
10ikr
you wouldn't want to spend much time at hot topic, would you?
Wasn't on an exam, we just spent a lesson trying to kill aliens.
you have to play Yakety Sax the entire time while being chased by cops and beautiful women
10oh win
run in, grab the shirt, leave the money, run out
10or, germans
10either way
t-shirt.
shorts.
nonono, not play
loud and proud

Hi Luna
i think it died
Because we fired the projectile at 45 degrees the vertical velocity had to be the same anyway, cos45 and sin45 are 0.7
Probably due to the time of day....well anyhow, how're you today Mexi?

I am absolutely loving this song
=3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn7uMwXYU9U&feature=related
ill be right bak
I already read it
XD
Then worked out the angle that would be needed to hit the alien with this time in the flight time equation.
Except...
07What in the hay is going on in here?
The angle we got we -23.something.
Which was...
O_o
Something about aliens and projectiles Luna
One of us decided to add 90 to it.
07ahhh...
To get 67. something.
07RobotPinkie how you feel?
We fired it at that angle.
And it hit the alien.
O_o
Is it odd that I remember similar calculations from my physics classes?
Why would it be?
Oh Luna's here?
how are you, Luna?
pinkie always looks creepy

dari?
They have no hands

well... the cows are sentient, apparently
In Boast Busters, we are treated to a scene where Twilight telepathically milks...a whole barn of cows
they might have figured out a way to milk themselves and sell the milk
or maybe they have milking machines
or maybe unicorns just do it.
does this server have SSL?
SSL, hm.
Someone wants to know if you've got SSL up Pontang.
she did, but that didn't seem to work at all.
:P
she tried
but alas, the nest was beyond salvation.
and thus twilight single hoofedly
disabled an entire section of the Winter Wrap up crew
a severely undermanned section, though
or underponied
Okay, thanks
Thanks for the info. I guess
At least I got to it before E_N this time

It's going to go even quicker when Season 2 comes.
inb4 Someone
/me pokes channel for IRC server info
and it seems like just yesterday that we hit 30 million...
snarf!
well...at least this snarf isn't as annoying...
excellent
The address is in the topic.
That's why I told you to read it.
(i just hope it stays good)
Oh.
Wait.
well, why shouldn't it be?
This is epic-chat.
everything's mostly the same
You're WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY behind.
Yeeees
We already switched to a different network ages ago.
yeah...
i just..
the production process, i mean
And just switched again today.
don't worry :-)
!S2
Season 2 begins in 8d:19h:46m:30s
I lost the info when I changed computers.
Ahhh
And the current mibbit thing on the website doesn't have the info.
*poke poke poke*
technology is 99% magnets.
well the first 2 episodes of season 2 would be the same quality at least as season 1 cause those episodes were supposed to be in season 1
wait... what's the point of Thundercats if it isn't all EIGHTIES
dat anime influence
My IRC client isn't showing irc.bronychat.net as viable
I tried connecting to <rainbowdash.bronychat.net>, but that didn't work.
she agreed to be a consultant executer or something
or did i get that wrong?
She's still there for season 2.
Just in a different position
"awesome" power
That sounded lame
executer? :D
You have to connect to irc.bronychat.net
...I don't see this happening.
oh wait, this is a sequel in continuity?
07not sure this is the first ep I could find
Good day!
6Same thing here, it redirects to here. . .
hello

oh there they go!
of course, he isn't a main character
Now they just need Panthro, and the Wiley Twins.

And it isn't as horrid a thing as I thought.
LOL
I knew it.
11Storm Troopers: Professionally trained to be the greatest warriors of the universe. Can't hit 5 people running around.

Yup
Non-stop
Snarf is actually appealing in this
which makes me enjoy watching it :P
I don't think I would survive.
11They could have easily turned Snarf into another Jar Jar Binks.
In other words, I hope you don't have to go to the bathroom anytime soon.
It's only 9 hours of show
.... if my math is right
More like 8, maybe 7 1/2
I don't think it is
22 minutes an episode
9 and a half to be precise
well then...

That's right, meowth!
I'm sort of running it on behalf of the room owner
-blushes- n-nevermind, I didn't say anything.
@FLuttershy: yea...
hmmmm
11Tails are used for balance, but as they get older, they become balanced on their own two legs, hence they don't need a tail.
HE KILLED SNARF
11Either that or warriors purposly chop them off.

And I'm totally fine playing PS3/X360 games on it
Fluttershy: Shoo be doo
11ValtheJean: Panthro is confirmed for the show, but he doesn't appear until later in the story.
Wut
I'm picky about quality, but if I can't see a difference between a 480 rip and a 1080 rip, I'll stick with the less-space-consuming 480 rip.
I have the 720 TV that I watched and the 720 iTunes that I use for videos I make
/me is hug'd~ :3
and no more mind control bullshit
I want him back as a main character :P
oh, it's like an anemone

Why not just borrow someone's TARDIS?
You're just being argumentative

And it'll last like a week and I won't be able to submit it properly.
I assume the Hub, like most channels, has two broadcasts, one for EST and one for PST
I want to talk but I don't want to talk
Yes!!!
Godwin's? in MY network TV?
Probably not even a week... An entire month.
rape baby > raby > rabies

13As for a second streaming on the 17th. I think the Hub is replaying it later in the day, but I'm unsure at this time if we're streaming the replay later in the day.
Come with me!
2,14 at 4 we're having a live stream of the HUB and other tv channels
Daz: awesome. if you wanna talk about 'that', i'll be around
Hi everyone
