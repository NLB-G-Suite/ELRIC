/me cough
Here
Buu
perfect cell DoctoDoctorWho
Mutterguy: it's pronouced moo
:D
DoctoDoctorWho: broly was beating by goku right
wut...
ghost nappa wins all
VEGETA VEGETA!
honestly I dont think anypony has my side when there are debates, Broly would win.
therainbowvortex: yes, yes he was
Those sounds...
/me grabs DoctoDoctorWho s side "I got it!"
i was wondering where the video was
DeathStar: No! My left side! Meh, I guess Ill be all right...
DoctoDoctorWho: and cell killed goku goku couldnt get the job done so gohan did thus making broly weker then cell
hai
Ohai Wrek's voice
DoctoDoctorWho: I'm sorry you didn't specify :(
smexy voice :D
DoctoDoctorWho: sorry but thats just my opion
therainbowvortex it's not your left side that's missing
Mutterguy: wat
AND KNOWING IS HALF THE BATTLE
ok, i know you just started streaming Wrek but i'm almost falling asleep at the PC :D
G.I JOOOOOOOOOOEEEE!!!
so i shall take my leave ^_^
Mutterguy: can u plz explain im confused :(
/me brohooves DeadpoolDash
Goodnight NocturnalBlade
oops DeathStar
therainbowvortex: But think about it, broly wiped the floor with all 4 of the super saiyan z fighters and piccolo, simultaniously, without trying. Cell had to ensure his survival by challenging them 1 at a time, and hr still had a rough time in fights. In 1v1.
this game looks familiar
/me brohooves Mutterguy
good night guys ^_^ thanks for the stream Wrek :3
night night NocturnalBlade
DoctoDoctorWho was complaining he was missing his left side so he was all right. In this case he'd be more sorry than you
/me dances
DoctoDoctorWho: in that case broly would win soz i havent seen all of the movie but your right if thats what hapaned
night NocturnalBlade
/me safety dances
http://butteryobread.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/tumblr_m0i2lqkr0o1qf04v7o1_500.jpg
/me dances dangerously >:3
(\ (\
/) /)
therainbowvortex: not to mention that cell claimed(but never proved he could) he could destroy an entire solar system, whereas broly destroyed an entire GALAXY, within story. we watched it happen
(\ /)
oh mai :3
/me hugs taoumi AdamTheDuck and DeathStar :)
/) (\
taoumi: the game is Marathon
mmmmmmm
therainbowvortex: but I proved my point so whatever
DoctoDoctorWho: hey like i said ive never seen broly fight and i agree with you
oh btw XKCD proved that theoritically piccolo has already glassed the earth...
Im back and got me some snacks and what type of freakin game is that?
DoctoDoctorWho: but do u lke dbz
the energy required to blow up the moon would have ignited the atmosphere
Mutterguy: that's no moon O_O
therainbowvortex: love it, and I can pm you the fight between broly and the z fighters in pm if you want
sorry sorry I had too ^^;
:O It's you!
Hmph
DoctoDoctorWho: yes plz that would be awsome
redundancy is redundant
/me points to DeathStar in case someone doesn't get it
:3
some times i wish all games had a panic knife
DeathStar i hope you don't ask anyone 'Does my bum look big in this?'
Mutterguy: I never do. 1 because you can never tell weather the person is being honest or not and 2 I have a tiny butt anyway
what? relative to other space stations?
:P
Mutterguy: yeah other space stations have huge asses XD
SO Wrek, what's with the genocide?
This looks like a Doom level :$
DeathStar: I have a tiny ass too :D
.
MadSurge: yay :D we can be tiny ass buddies!.... or not that sounds weird....
hehehe
DeathStar: :D not for me!
MadSurge: yay tiny ass buddys then :D
Egh, my stream keeps lagging
/me pulls out 3DS and plays more Tales of the Abyss
...
yey legs machined togeather
So many corpses
man those elevators. they work
the word katar alwase reminds me of voldo from the soul edge/caliber series
taoumi: actually my nick is thanks to Voldo :D
lol is that one of his moves?
i pride my self at being ok at all the charicters of soul caliber. but when it comes to voldo i jsut eat the contoler and watch the fire works
taoumi: now follow me, do you remember Soulcalibur 2's arcade?
mhmm
vaugely
I wanted to put in Mad Surgeon in Conquest mode but wouldn't fit in :D
ah~ now it makes sence
taoumi: though Mad Surge makes still sense, and would never trade it
Also agreed, Voldo is ace
i haven't tryed my hand at SC5 but SC4 runined it for me w/ the critical finishes
taoumi: they're better
it changed the game
well soul edge and sould caliber used to be all about the counter game
taoumi: they're still there but not a one hit kill, more like Street Fighter supers
eeeh it's still rewarding the atack spamer and that's kinda .... meh
taoumi: kinda
that was my favoret part of soul caliber. the people that would coem over from street fighter or DoA and think they can combo their way to victory
taoumi: :D poor fools
and be like. lolololololol i'm going to use 2 buttons to crush you
guard and kick

Ponies47: Wrek is, but he's sleeping, and his video ended, so we are watching dead air black screen
is it me or does sweetie belle's and Diamond Tiara's design rivals against each other
Gold_Demona: Ah
Gold_Demona therainbowvortex Life is a cruel and hard thing. Sometimes it gives people the worst the exprience burned into our vary fabric of being. To rise above that and realise the past never has to effect you maybe not in what you do it defined who you are. Exprience is both painful and joyful but never give up cause you can one day break the cycle and become the better person
CrimsonPhoenix: Did you also notice that in every episode were the class room is shown there is a blue scootaloo in the front row.
tl;dr
Yay for random stuff i wanted to said
Dat life lesson .-.
The internet was the last place I'd expect to learn anything
killerpony7733: that was butifull dude :'(
Go cry in the corner Adam
killerpony7733: Exactly. I dealt with my experiences and moved on with my life.
And I must say my life right now is pretty good. =)
Mega_Milk, just because of her cutie mark I'll call her Pit
AdamTheDuck The internet can surprise you at times. Besides i just share what i felt like it. ^^
like saying*
Derp~
Gold_Demona: i moving on and my life better exepct now i flinch alot when people bring their arm up or somthing
therainbowvortex: That sounds like something only counselling can fix.

CrimsonPhoenix: :D
Mega_Milk, but you don't see her in Ponyville Confidential

CrimsonPhoenix: Yes you di :3

Bye CrimsonPhoenix
im pretty sure anyways
Gold_Demona: I'm worried about getting a job/a girlfriend, but my life is pretty ace too :)
MadSurge: lol, I think a job's a more important concern than a girlfriend. :P
wut is a girl?
Gold_Demona, today's society can flip that view... >.>
/me points to herself to show Jmo what a girl is.
AdamTheDuck: Screw society. They don't know swuat
For all I know you could be a guy.
D:
MTF
You've seen pictures of me, Jaymoo! :D
DON'T LAI TO ME D;
Oh yeah I forgot.
Carry on.
Gold_Demona: well, both are important on their own way :P my parents are still helping me out
Jmo: Trans women are women
On the job front of course :D
lol
Na, you don't say.
Not obvious enough.
you just implied that they weren't real women, make up your mind
It was a joke.
My god.
some joke
I'm sorry it didn't satisfy you diddums.
o_o
Jmo Many could probably mistake me for a girl at first. But the shock on their face when i'm not is hilarious
I can never tell when Jmo is being serious :/

That makes me feel so old :D
IKR
Finding some good stuff this morning - Tenacious D - Kickapony ^_^
Never watched Fairy Oddparents
NSFW if you decide to look it up - strong language
What was the episode about, Lyra`?
To bad the show got cancelled before some speical about a baby or something was supposed to come out. :/
Da pick of destiny.
Hmm?
Ponies47: a baby also voiced by Tara Strong :D
Yep :D
http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/247757_10151446196064966_81011142_n.jpg
clean version of Kickapony is not clean - still strong language :S
Pfffft, spiders, lol
:3 Along 290 outbound from Cypress, there's a road called Kickapoo
And there's your useless fact of the day
Are there stream?
I dont think Tenacious D is safe to post this early in the morning :$
XAX: not really
Also, horre shet 65 people.
MadSurge: Define not really...
65 is pretty small for this channel
Wow :o
Only 65??
PANIC
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE
Aahh!!!
/me hits the "Panic" button
So is there one or not? I wanna share a video D:
XAX: Wrek went to nap and left a Eddie Izzard dvd running, but now it's over
Oh.
well... sneaky
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnVWW3rODdg
XAX: So I think sharing videos is okay
XAX: Super said we could post video links until Wrek wakes up and makes us stop.
inb4 kick ;)
^
Does someone here have brothers or sisters btw? I'm curious :D
I have one younger sister
08,01hey Phase4: http://i.imgur.com/YPy4c.png
Ive got an older and younger bro
I have a older bro and he is a complete jerk
:I
I personally have a younger bro, he's almost 18 now
^
I know the whole apple/Microsoft bit at the end is BS, but iunno about the rest.
08,01MadSurge: of course not, it's preposterous that someone can run the Linux without the underlying support of Windows drivers
:3 An aged pony video - Confound These Ponies - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_3ryX7Fhy0
My younger sister is 26. :P
Gold_Demona: she's my age :O
08,01i mean, come on, a hobby community project making a whole operating system?
08,01remember that Apple tried and failed, and eventually moved to Microsoft
.-.
Yesh, video! Drinking pony is Best Pony :D
but
oh me.
Gold_Demona: does your sister look older? :D
MadSurge: Nope. In fact she appears much younger than she is.
And suddenly we're asking about eachothers sisters.
MadSurge: Doesn't help that she has a learning disability.
.-.
Gold_Demona: well, my brother looks older than me now :D
Gold_Demona: learning disability? :O
MadSurge: Her brain has trouble with speech comprehension.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq_r19xoKJE
MadSurge: Kinda like dyslexia but with spoken words instead of written ones
Gold_Demona: poor thing :(
MadSurge: Yeah, she's had it rough. Doesn't help I was a huge bully to her growing up. >__>
MadSurge: I'm not anymore, but it's still something I'm ashamed of
Tsk tsk tsk
/me is listening to Paradise.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1jevWbVAzQ
Gold_Demona: we all have stuff to be ashamed off, so no worries
Gold_Demona: she doesn't hold grudges, I hope
MadSurge: Nope
Thanksfully
Gold_Demona: then it's all okay! :)
Yep
Yesh
Gold_Demona: having a brother at 9 year old helped, I was just happy for having a baby bro
heh
My sister and I are two years apart, so I don't remember not having her around. :P
Gold_Demona: even if now we're the opposite of each other, we still kinda like each other :D
I have a sister, 3 years younger than me.
I got a big sister and shes like 5 years older then me >.>

wow
i have headphones on
Mega_Milk What headphones?
and i can faintly hear things going on in wrek's house
killerpony7733: There nothing special
someones in wreks kitchen -lol
messing with glasses
Is it a zombie? D:
now they opened something...
and there also wearing house shoes
cause they cant freakin PICK UP THERE FEET!
so all i here is sliding every now and again
Mega_Milk Dayum you got one heck of a auditory sense
How you hear this? I hear nothing. O_o
hi
I hear white noise mostly
killerpony7733: No these headphones are insanely loud
You appear to be a stalker by saying that, Mega_Milk
DoshWithReenbows: I was actually modding tf2
Mega_Milk Ah makes sense. Mine are a bit screwy tbh
Are you actually peeking into Wrek's window and telling us what he's doing? D:<
DoshWithReenbows: And i forgot i left BS going
DoshWithReenbows: And I keep hearing noises
DoshWithReenbows: Then I realized im hearing wrek's house
and somepony is stirring about over there.
I hear nothing, and I maxxed my volume. o_o
killerpony7733: even at the lowest volume these headphones blast loud
Mega_Milk: I be stirring mah breakfast, if that counts?
Sylandest: :D
also, morning everypony :)
Gold_Demona: Do you have headphones on?
Sylandest: Morning.
Mega_Milk: Nope
Mega_Milk Either they are high quality or just plain odd but yeah i'm impressed
Gold_Demona: You need head phones
killerpony7733: I got these from a dollar store -lol
All I hear is white noise that kinda sounds like a screeching tea kettle.
Mega_Milk Cheap ones so guess it makes sense
no tea
killerpony7733: Yeah the more expensive head phones have filters that prevent ear damage
killerpony7733: Cheap ones have no filter so you can easily go def with these things if you expose them too long -lol
Gold_Demona: What you hear is a fan
Gold_Demona: He has one going
Ah
or atleast there one somewhere in there
Morning, gys.

Kammerjunk: a black screen! isn't it awesome? :D
Kammerjunk: Wrek put on a dvd and went to sleep. DVD ended hours ago. :P
Oh. I really need to watch more of the Legend of Korra. I just haven't been around to it.
A black screen? Meh, I prefer the TV Test Signal Show.
I love Korra. Can't wait till the next season. =D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVB-iLTvSn4
cake for breakfast
Black screen is nice, but not at nice as buffer show. ;3
Kammerjunk: spoilers were ridiculously obvious for the Wedding, and didn't spoil anything about the Changelings :D
Gold_Demona: still have to watch that :O
Changeling is best pony.
Gold_Demona: so no spoilers please :D
ok, I won't say anything. ;3

ASoftFluffyThing: What IRC client are you using?
Kammerjunk, mIRC
Trying to set up the highlight to ping me.

Just Add your own name there.
No Case Sensitive, and make sure you choose a ping sound.
I did that already.
Ping me again, please?

ASoftFluffyThing
Okay it works! Thanks!

Gold_Demona: His mother or sister or some woman is awake though
Yeah, apparently, Wrek fell asleep while watching a film.

Wrek put on a DVD and went to bed.
Hey! Listen!

its outside of my language range
The other person could be Wrek, though.
Sylandest: Same -lol
Kammerjunk: It is wrek

Aha.
/me only knows german, english and dutch
Maybe she's waking him up and berating him for being a sleepyhead. lol XD
:|
Gold_Demona: If its like 4 am doubtful
If he slept till 4 PM, he should be.
Kammerjunk: Ohhhhh pm
then yeah shes probably waking him up
lol Yeah PM.
Also, INB4 Wrek. Calling it now.

"Get yo lazy ass up off dat bed!"

Mechromancer, new class in borderlands 2

:D

Mrs. Tegensten.
Tegelsten*
yeah i think there about to have dinner
shes laying out plates
and speaking with someone
This is probably the most fun I've had in weeks.
lol
-lol XD
Mega_Milk I hear nothing! And I have headphones in
Listening in on Wrek's life. XD
http://derpiboo.ru/117478 mechromancer
ASoftFluffyThing: Crank thembitches to the max and listen really really carefully
Mega_Milk, the are to the max. Stream and computer volume
DAMMIt
Yeah, I don't hear anything right now either, I guess the computer's not close enough to where the sounds are. But somehow Mega_Milk can hear them.
just had it
-lol I can hear everything!
I can hear something.
Plates'n'stuff.
Mega_Milk must have dem fanceh speakers in his campooter
Kammerjunk: Yes!
I just turned my volume up a bit. So whenever I get pinged, my ears cry bloody tears.
Kammerjunk: Thats it! the clanking of the plates as you she pulls them out
So thanks for that.
ASoftFluffyThing: No -lol I got me some dollar tree headphones! XD
Mega_Milk, how the fuck?
Kammerjunk: Yeah that is the price to listening
ASoftFluffyThing: XD I dont know apparently I got the one good set from the ghetto dollar tree :D
I have in noise-cancelling headphones and can't hear shit in the background
ASoftFluffyThing: My guess is Mega_Mik has some super fancy headphones that cancels out white noise. >.>
Gold_Demona: XD -lol maybe :3
yeah there eating :3
This is going to be interesting to tell Wrek.
-lol :D
I heard a clanking! Very very faint...
I can hear the white noise from the TV (It's also making my ears cry, by the way), but I can still hear plates and stuff.
Kammerjunk: Do you also hear them talking?
No
I hear no talking
Kammerjunk: And the knives on the plates?
Kammerjunk: And the fan?
there was also some running water a moment ago
I hear a fan, and I hear the whistling kettle noise.
possibly a bathroom
I hear nothiiiiiiiiiiing.
I hear the knives and the fan, but not the talking right now. I fear turning my headphones further up, for my ears would bleed.
ASoftFluffyThing: XD maybe I do just have really good ears then -lol
/me has on noise-cancelling earbuds
ASoftFluffyThing: Not even white noise?
Not even white noise
yeah I can hear it all pretty clearly now
ASoftFluffyThing: By noise-cancelling, do you mean the noise around YOU or the noise coming from the headphones?
Gold_Demona, the noise around me
I hear nothing coming from the headphones
It shouldn't be cancelling the white noise then... Odd. O_o
Fine, I'll turn my headphones further up so I can hear potential talking, but if my ears bleed, I'm sending you the bill.
ASoftFluffyThing: Try unpluggin the headphones and hear just with your speakers
Kammerjunk: XD i cant make outanything there saying.
Oh wait, I have free health care.
Kammerjunk: But they seem to be just talking casually
no kind of emotion
no laughtwer
no yelling
just neutral
Sounds like my family.
-lol
Nothing from the speakers except the soft sound of my laptop fan
Just tried the Peta games... Wow
sounds like sweden :S
All dem bloods :2
/me badum tssh
Dragonmatte: ikr?
ASoftFluffyThing: Hmmmmm I dont understand it you should atleast hear the plates
Gold_Demona: Can you hear the clanking of the plates?
I hear the plates
I don't.
and the knives against the plates
I can hear it, Master. The clanking, the never-ending clanking.
the speakers for my computer are low, even on 10%
Kammerjunk: :D
Gold_Demona: I mean, i don't care how it's made, it's still delicious :3
It's hard to make out over the white noise, but I hear the plates.
Now if I were using my sister's computer, yeah I could probably hear it.
ASoftFluffyThing: Then use it woman! XD Im not sure why im enjoying this but i am! -lol
ASoftFluffyThing: Just casual.....
My sis has her laptop, and she's at school atm
ah
Im kinda interested to here more
but i cant go any farther than wreks bedroom -lol
I just want to hear something besides the silence in my earbuds
hello everypony
ASoftFluffyThing: XD
Hello, Dark92Enigma
Dark92Enigma: Sup.
Kammerjunk: ikr
Hiyo Dark92Enigma

Kammerjunk: Alright mate.....there eating......

Dark92Enigma: Wait, you ALSO have a dog named Luna?

Kammerjunk: yes
Dark92Enigma: Luna doggy XD

Dark92Enigma, we're listening to Wrek's life
Dark92Enigma: Me and Kammerjunk are listening to wreks household
Dark92Enigma: We're listening to Wrek's house!
and Gold_Demona
i can't listen anything
but ASoftFluffyThing cant hear it :3
^
Neither can i
its nothing super great
All I hear is the clanking plates. Mega_Milk can somehow hear them talking.
there just eating in silence now
Everyone has magic ears except me.
there are just 2 of them
I'm a magic man, I got magic hands.
but im pretty sure wrek is still PO'ed in his bed
i cant hear his breathing or anything over the fan
I can't even hear a fan.
but i didnt hear his foot steps so he didnt leave the bed
The only time I heard voice was what the one lady came to wake Wrek up.
ASoftFluffyThing: its blended with the white noise.
Mega_Milk, darn.
Gold_Demona: Yeah i told you she was walking around the house! -lol
Lol is anybody recording this?
Gold_Demona: And talking to someone then suddenly I could hear footsteps "Thump....thump thump......thump thump thumpt thump THUMPTHUMPTHUMP"
Well hay, I don't even have Fraps running.
closer and louder
I would make a bad ass espionage man.....
or maybe some kinda woodsman....

Every time I put a skin on it, there's this little button box thingy that appears on top of my game list that says "CON..." or "CO...". I have no idea what this is and I can't click on it or anything and all it does is get in the way.

Wrek: she pokes you with wub?
It's not really a button cuz it doesn't do anything. I can't click on it, and I can't make it go away. If I even knew what the rest of the word was, that might be helpful, but I can't figure out what it is. :<

Gold_Demona: Yeah, but then I just end up glidin' out of this chair.

2,14 as suzaku may end up handing her ass to her

Hi, everyone! Happy birthday, MLP! :)
sumi, what if one of your robots dies? is it then dead forever or just the battle?
hai AJIsAwesome
Invi: just for the battle
2,14 depends on the mech and the mission
/me hugs Invi :)
Invi: but you have to spend money on the repairs
oh god
Yo AJIsAwesome
/me huggies AJIsAwesome back ^^
/me hugs Vivix :)
/me slaps AJIsAwesome around a bit with a large trout
MadSurge, ah okay. like in World of Tanks :P

/me hugs AJIsAwesome and puts party hat on his head
inb4 lazer arm
Jaymoo
You stahp
naow
nu
yes
nuu
still...
derpy is amused
Invi: but some units can't die at all depending on the mission or backstory. If those die, game over
Dat maxing out
^
dat ad in my face
dat Derpy :3
^^^^^
butter toast
i really wish this was in english...or that i could read Japanese XD
MAX OUT ALL UNITS AND PILOTS
2,14 to summarize what I just did
2,14 spent my money to upgrade the new mechs
BladedWings|HW: the story is always a crisis where characters from different mangas/cartoons converge to fight a common threat :D
2,14 used my pilot's stat points to give them nice abilities, like support defense and hit and run
dat dialouge
^
2,14 if the majority of the chat could read it, I'd show you it :P
I wish. :D
2,14 but since I'm trying to entertain, I'm skipping the stuff you can't read :P
i could read some of it, but not all of it
I can read just about zero kanji
MadSurge: well thats cool and all i just want to be able to know what da buck i'm attacking with XD
Or whatever it is
13http://i.minus.com/ibfFv8QzkaL7kE.png
Buy ALL the candy corn!
I did not play at all for last years TF2 haloween stuff
@Shizuka: you mean in general or the tf2 update?
AJIsAwesome, not before I buy it all
13yes
:O
ASoftFluffyThing: You better not. :D
BladedWings|HW: the GBA games are translated and playable if you're interested, but those still featured Original Characters exclusively
2,14 not entirely
ASoftFluffyThing, oh really?
o.o
Did you just ping yourself, ASoftFluffyThing? :D
It will be a combo of the pumpkin head guy, the ghastly gibus ghost, and the eye I bet.
AJIsAwesome, yes I did :3
oh....mah gawd
DAT SCYTHE
/me died of awsomeness
AJIsAwesome! :D
MadSurge! :D
glad im not the only one who did that ASoftFluffyThing :D
Pumpkin Head, great lofi 'punk' from Japan
/me hugs MadSurge :D
AJIsAwesome: hugs back
9900 dmg eh?
*insert DBZ meme here*
indeed
You could say that it is... over, 9000?
THE BALLS ARE INNER-wait...
wrong meme
Derpy goes to deliver mail. Some how she ends up in a universe full of japanese anime mechs.
Logic.
Barbetos|AtWork: all in a day's work
O_O
Naturally.
Makes sense to me.
DAYUM
that could have killed 3 of them at once...
Still don't understand why that mech makes the screen fizzle
make that 30
Yeah. Pilots wearing glasses would never happen.
MadSurge, because it's cool
DAT BLADE
Invi: any story reasons, I mean :D
Biggus Gladius
MadSurge, uuh... it gives the story more coolness ^^
i-i-i think i jizzed my pants because of that attack
wut.
wat
DUN DUN DUUUUUUN

TMI

Bronysith, look at the chat list.

so just read that article about wal-mart, and I figured they were at least trying to cash in on some of the popularity, just they relied on a older source
my god
Where is your god now.
Bronysith: ikr!?

LASER ARM
2,14 Bandai? uh...yes...Bandai is still alive and well...

Bronysith: TEAM DEATHMATCH
do you realized how much legal stuff they're gonna pull of if they want to release internationally?
Snow team deathmatch?!
Dken2021 to be honest, no
Bronysith: team deathmatch!
Team Deathmatch
just remember how it was hard enough to get Tatsunoko VS capcom over to the states
I'd buy from welovefine if they didn't charge me $20 shipping per item.
Bronysith: lucky bastard. I wish we had a Hot Topic. I'd totally get one of those Rainbow Dash industrials if we did.
"time to rock!" "to the moon!"
You know, if my job would permit one.
i love my Game of Thrones derpy shirt

Wait, they made a Game of Thrones Derpy shirt?

0,5I got inventor before finding that SolidWorks is faster and easier to me.
BaconMane: Is it the full version or are there limitations?
Snow: Why don't you move it to the top of your head? :P
0,5It's an educational version.
0,5You can do everything the others can, I think.
AJ pls
0,5Well, everything you really need. Id imagine there's some features cut out.
Jaymoo pls
dat lucky bastard, kust survuved

Wow their download servers are fast. I"m downloading Maya at 25 MegaBYTES per second.
BaconMane nope
fully featured
0,5Ah
they do however, mark the save files as student version
0,5Well I prefer SolidWorks anyhow :P
0,5Easier on my computer and it loads up quicker
Paying extra for that business internet is really working out this time :)
BaconMane: Actually, the educational is literally the paid version, but free.
0,5And the industry uses SolidWorks more
2,14 LC: actually it depends on the company
BaconMane: Well, Maya is anyway...
2,14 and the type of CaD work they use
yay
hes gone
so much death in this game
there is always death
at my company everyone uses Autodesk

I've never had T-Mobile. I heard they're good but sometimes their service derps.
i should know about that XD
/me had The Ripoff aka Verizon
My mom and I are on Verizon. She NEEDS Verizon for it's coverage.
well everypony, im off to see the wizard
Bye Bronysith. Have fun.
Take care Bronysith!
the wonderful wizard of oz Bronysith ?
Toodles Bronysith
BladedWings,yup
My mom had Alltell before Verizon bought them out so she had her old Alltell phone for a while
BYe, Bronysi-
HAG
*GAH
However, it's getting hard to afford Verizon, so we're thinking of switching to a prepaid service.
Verizon is freaking ridiculous with their prices, and you only get so little. Two dollars per megabyte
^
so um... wat game is this?
Kandarihu, Straight Talk is pretty good. Only thing you have to pay for is the phone itself and the phone card.
Super Robot Wars.
^Lol'd
I don't know. :P
Kandarihu, thing is I think they use Sprint's towers. At least down here they do. I think it varies
Hmm. It would be nice if there were a prepaid service that uses Verizon's towers.
how many people know wat hes doing?
ugh, i hate this chapter 15 test...
Upgrading his characters
It's an RPG. I'm pretty sure most of us know.
keep getting everything wrong
mylittleponylover12: he's maxing his mechs and pilot stats
I don't think there's any prepaid services that uses Verizon towers except for the Verizon pay-as-you-go phones
^
k
mylittleponylover12: count also new game plus benefits
Everything else I think is Sprint, Tracfone, or AT&T
Yeah. We kinda passed on those phones. It's too expensive.

I'd play with TF2, but given there's a huge ass puddle in between the US and Europe, connection issues won't be unthinkable.

Wrestling game? You mean that old arcade game where you chase after Mr. Burns, Maggie and a bigass diamond?
Wait, never mind.

What's wrong with Charlie Brooker?

Lul
o u
GilDash: he should not make miniseries, he makes only depressing stuff :(
MadSurge: That's because he's Charlie Brooker. :p
GilDash: his rants aren't depressing
aww my 2 fwiends aren'tin here :(
I've been meaning to watch Black Mirror for ages...
MadSurge: They kind of are, if you think long and hard on them.
GilDash: they're airing it now here. I are sad now
and oddly enough, it doesnt look bad on him.
http://www.david-tennant.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/cwc.jpg
Still hot
ikr, vivix
GilDash: but that's because british people are too cynical :D
MadSurge: Yeah, it's not the most light-hearted series around. XD
oof, id let him be my doctor, he seems to know a lot of stuff. about medicine. and non-risque things
http://derpy.me/OvZLM
Hehe

Caramel
MadSurge: He didn't physically take hold of you, sit you down, duct tape you to the chair and then switch it on, did he? :p
GilDash: (my mom is going for a weekend with her co-workers)
Yo that is impressive that Caramel can play this, yet he/she dosen't know Japanese.
Maybe I am wrong...
GilDash: when you're under a laptop and the remote is far away, yes :D
MadSurge: You weak minded fool! Use the Force! :D

MadSurge: I like my dramas though. Was a fan of Spooks before everyone was killed off every other season.
I'm going to take off. I have some things I need to attend to.
GilDash: I prefer horror movies to dramas :D
Toodles, Everlasting_Joy
bye Everlasting_Joy
Goodbye Everlasting_Joy :)
BYe, Everl- gah!
MadSurge: See, horror movies aren't really my cup of tea. I'd rather watch action, or sci-fi... really looking forwards to Skyfall when it comes out over here. :)
AJIsAwesome: I hate it when that happens :(
Colt_Brovakiin: Me too. :(
GilDash: we could still watch action movies or science fiction! :3 (hope you can take incessant complaining about how the aliens look too human though :D )

MadSurge: I know. :D
2,14 I'd say it's well within reason
but scale, the monster can destroy hundreds of building sized enemies in a barage like that
how can a single one taking the full brunt survive
2,14 indiscriminate fire
2,14 if you notice, it didn't get hit by every shot
2,14 it makes sense it can wipe out a space army, because there's lots of weaker targets
and this one? that rifle was shown to only barely penetrate a single target
just nearly took out a battleship with a single direct hit
2,14 *sigh*
yeah im applying logic to a game based on several anime series
2,14 it's a game...a game about giant robot animes, with rediculous robots that can throw galaxies at each other...just go with it

hey
So how often are MLP episodes played here? I watch the streamed video reactions on youtube all the time, want to be part of one :( Wish i was a MLP fan sooner.
Um hi... I suck at first impressions so... umm... yeah
from the Google images results it looks like you're either calling me a mushroom, a flower, or some kind of insect
Hey Cades
and by that i mean, be a part of watching an episode, not on youtube
Hai pot80 :)
welcome
Malmortius: I know that feel. They stream pony eps on BMN and on other days randomly. :)
2,14 the episodes are streamed when they air. We don't have any control over it
Malmortius: When Season 3 starts up, we stream the episodes as they air
hi pot80
thanks
Welcome to Bronystate, pot80 and Malmortius. :)
Malmortius: wait until s3 is announced :3 in the meantime, stay and enjoy our other streams
oh
if id thought i'd be on here a week ago :P
Make sure to read the rules while you're jere. :)
I figured it would be some kind of elaborate insult
:P
*here
7Not always.
2,14 that's all from me today. I've got a lot of emotional shit to deal with
So many users come from reaction videos :p
2,14 hope you enjoyed
/me hugs Val
7aren't I allowed to be exhausted from school sometimes? :P
pot80: We all went through that
Thanks for the stream Caramel
take car Val!
how longs it been since a new season of MLP?
no
Bye, Caramel. Hope you feel better. :(
lol underlines = color?
thanks for the stream Caramel
Im tired from not doing anything all day.
you're not allowed to be sou out of character
Caramel: I hope you feel better soon :(
Malmortius: About 6 months.
already read the rules
lol sounds like me yesterday
OH GOD YES http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349902609973.jpg
I was sick and basically slept all day
thanks for the stream Caramel and i hope you feel better soon :(
...colors?
well im at work
really colluquy?
2,14 CrimsonPhoenix: that's borderline. Were I streaming right now I'd probably warn-kick
2,14 so just keep that in mind
7Oh. well, you're out of luck because I'm just not in the mood for the normal witty repartee
GilDash: yeah, outline
but that doesnt mean im doing anything.
oh pot80, never ask the mods for ponies
Just because it's a picture from 4chan?
i dont know how my client allowed is all
trust me
Never ask for ponies. :D
why on earth would I ask for ponys?
2,14 no, because it's a picture of trollestia using her horn as a wang
CrimsonPhoenix too small
All I've had to do at work so far is find a bag of clickers and give it to some people
a wang? it would be a nose if you knew the reference
why do bronies consider horns to be reproductive organs? :s
G3.5
lol
Caramel: that's from a Persona 4 fancomic though. Still borderline nsfw :D
So I'm working on ruby on rails crap which I will never stop complaining about...
2,14 it's still inapropriate
fun fact: arguing with the mods increases your chances of further punishment ten fold
7what do you people even /do/?
CCCP: I don't know. :S
ok i wont
well i can basically do as much or as little as i want… its my place.
I always found horns as mediums for concentrating magic.
Hey everypony
Hi, O-Griofa. :)
hi O-Griofa
Hi O-Griofa

But wednesdays are slow.
So today was a day of triumpf for me. The story goes back to the second week of the school year.

like 90s stuff.
I sit on the bus everyday in the same spot, with a 3-5th grader (i havent asked) she saw i had pinkie pie as my background and then started spewing to me about MLP
well here's a more appropriate for compensation http://i.imgur.com/RAM4c.jpg
We sit there everyday, usually her talking, but its whatever.
7Y'know I've been a /lot/ calmer and more stable since I started coming here regularly again... probably somewhat ironically.
O-Griofa: Nice. :)
"It's probably something to do with..." I look up today's excuse "... clock speed."
Haha, I need to keep a list of bullshit excuses to give people when they complain...
I'm just going to leave this here.
its an excuse calendar
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr9WcIdh0TQ&feature=channel&list=UL
you can buy em online :)
awesome
2YEARS ALREADY
some of the stuff is pretty funny, some of its not
If I ever need a gift for my boss I know exactly what to buy
but its a good read when you're bored.
Fim is still just a little filly of a show
I met her sister, 10th grader, as am i.(shes sexy) she thought it was cool I talk to her sister out of being nice and today i asked her out, i got a yes, then i found out she is a fellow pegesister, great day for me.
theres pages and pages and pages so theres more than enough to keep you entertained for like a month.
CrimsonPhoenix: cheers http://derpiboo.ru/118928

MadSurge yes

7People, but silence. Oh SC how I missed you.
AJIsAwesome i love all of pinkies songs :3

AJIsAwesome: they really made bronies a favour with that song :D
is there a stream any time soon?
Welcome lexiedoodle :)
MadSurge: They sure did. :D
spud363: Not yet. :)
:P
Why don't you give us a topic then?
lexiedoodle: a chat rule, never ask for ponies, trust me :D
hi spud363 :)
7No I tend to pick annoying bastard topics to make people feel uncomfortable.
If you ask for ponies, they'll give you "ponies". :D
The Welcome song is one of the few songs performedby Pinkie's actual VA
hai
thelonepony: ask for anything but ponies xD
Then stop your complaining
/me kidnaps AJIsAwesome your my wife now
:P
never say no to Panda !!! HEY Panda howdy :o
Cranberry_Scotch nice fact :3
hi Saigneur
alexxm: But I'm a man. :S
7which, when I'm being lazy, tends to be their sex life. I have this little internal scale in my head for how much they blush.
:3
AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/b13af9427063aacc34691e3281cda330.png :3
oh ok
hi CCCP
so has anyone told lexiedoodle about the nick tab thing yet?
Plus, let's keep the RP to a minimum. :)
^
hi everypony :)
people dont join this channel to chat they join to idle. duh.
ok back (never said I was gone whoops)
Yea, I remember that debate xP
Well have fun trying to gauge that over an IRC channel
hi
so whats streaming?
lexiedoodle: To nick tab, just type part of someone's name in and push tab. It's autocomplete. :)
Aww
lol this is awesome
Saigneur! hiya1
its raining alot outside, i really freaking love the rain this is awesome :)
CCCP: Lucky you. :(
I haven't really gotten anything explained to me on heree..this site confuses mee lol
guy names his newborn daugher "Pinkamena Diane <lastname>"
i love the rain, your lucky CCCP :(
ahh nevermindd..
Its raining where you are? LUCKY D:<
lexiedoodle:me neither, just think before you type and observe how others act.
/me facepalms
7If his last name is not cake it is a wasted opportunity
lexiedoodle: Bronystate is known for Brony Movie NIght, which streams 2 movies and 2 pony episodes on Friday and Saturday.
CCCP: I want rain to wash my car :$
lexidoodle: plus read the rules and FAQ
lexiedoodle: On other days, we stream random things.
Like anime, games, and sometimes videos.
lexiedoodle: No asking for ponies, no complaining about stream, type part of nick and hit tab to talk to people and dont be irratating, that pretty much all you need to know
MadSurge :) rain is good for so many things :3
by "we" he means the mods
7well. less fun
thelonepony: Yeah. :D
Podcast on Saturdays :)
Its totally fun.
Id do it.
okay sweet c: thanks c:
why no asking for ponies?
i love Podcast Saturdays :)
^
Details about what and what not to do come later
what, ask people about their sex life on IRC or name your daughter Pinkamena?
/you learn them yourself
spud363: you don't wanna know
Name my daughter Pinkamena
what happens then? (I tend never to come on saturdays)
ok...
lol
It seems rude to request ponies when they're streaming something else.
spud363: rule number one. you do not ask for them, rule number 2 you DO NOT ask for them.
trust the lonepony
7I would never inflict a child with that name.
yea but y?
that's worse than Renesmee tbh
I think its awesome.
spud363: They like to keep the ponies mixed in, so its not constantly poni's, i think. Somone correct me if im wrong
G 3.6
its funny how friday movie night starts 12:00 saturday for me
Because it seems rude.
that's wat
lets just say this happens when ponies are requested: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&ved=0CCwQtwIwAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVo13WMTQJ84&ei=gud1UO3IMOG0iQLNt4H4Bg&usg=AFQjCNEnyiLBq63QGJozRkOUFlEp3B6QsA&sig2=o4Zh7PaUfuoYAbbZOLJW6Q

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyT-3TPcE4&feature=related
Arcane_: ;3; you finish Black 2?
I hope not O_O
But as of this point, daugher gets named Pinkamena, son gets named Dash.
Spectrum_Rush: :D
maby someones playing a joke and streaming a loading screen?
I doubt it. :D
could be
<_<
>_>

It would say "On Air".

check this out! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urnUYQt-9bc
oh yeah forgot about that bit
too bad
;)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDtUzRIG6I
>implying
it would of made a funny april fools day prank
CCCP: wut :I
CCCP: My orchestra director would play that. :D
7wow and I thought I was nerdy for arbitrarily one day deciding to give my hypothetical kids the middle names 'Tali' and 'Chell'
CCCP: Wh.. What.. is. this?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtN1YnoL46Q&feature=related
AJIsAwesome really? lol
ima go
Yep. :D
see ya
O-Griofa it is amazing :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urnUYQt-9bc
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6TdhB4LqN8 The song that this vieo remix is clearly a Kirby song but where exactly is it from?
soo many videos
CCCP: I concur, but.. What the heck?!
maybe ill be back if theres nothing to do
I get more nerdy and strange as I get older.
haha, those aren't actually too bad
O-Griofa idk XD
I know, right?!?!?
Its actually a great idea.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzmnPs64K74
Tali and Chell is pretty cool too
dammit, I can't get Dan Bull's Dishonored rap out of my head :3
Not sure if I should correct you on what I actually meant, or if you're just messing with me
CrimsonPhoenix: I think it's from Amazing Mirror.
why dont they stream Nichijou on here any more? :C http://derpy.me/Dywyp
brony compilation! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urnUYQt-9bc
AJIsAwesome, can you be a bit more precise?
Give me a minute.
I think we know whats going on.
I'll never name my kids after characters from anything, though
ARE YOU GOOGLING/
?**
I will.
hello everypony
CrimsonPhoenix: Nope.
good
hi The_Awesomeness
Hi, The_Awesomeness. :)
I value my fun over their livelyhood.
Hai The_Awesomeness
im feeling good today what about you?
7You know your daughter will get called Pinkeye right? or something equally vaguely-connected and cruel.
GOT IT!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdrqdW4Miao <must see
http://i.imgur.com/Zw3fi.gif
no school on friday, no homework, nothing but free time
CrimsonPhoenix: It's from the final boss of the game.
AJIsAwesome, Bingo
I'm pretty sure he's not being serious
YAY!
...pretty sure
7Idk it's SR
7he goes both ways
right?
She wont get called anything because she wont associate herself with primitive public school children.
I'm just getting obsess with this remix
7Private school children can be equally if not more shitty.
it just fit so well
this is true; I actually got bullied a lot more when I was in private school
Homeschooling./
Is what I actually meant.
7Homeschooled kids tend to be /weird/. aside from that obvious bias, they'd have pretty poorly developed social skills.
hello everypony :)
hi BoroBrony
LOL
hi
Hi, Boodfire. :)
Hai BoroBrony
* BoroBrony
hi BoroPony
nice tab AJIsAwesome :P
hi BoroBrony
Colt_Brovakiin: :P
damnit
hi BoroBrony
I kind of proved you right.
how are things BoroBrony
7?
hi BoroBrony
I was homeschooled.
7ah.
7Then you absolutely see my point.
7Homeschooled kids grow up to be people who want to name their kids Pinkamena and Dash
I'm just gonna leave this here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPg8qKIbIYU :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=B_MW65XxS7s
Except the social skills stuff, thats BS and theres no evidence to support it. I have met hundreds of homeschooled children who are better socially adapted than kids who have attended public or private schools.
goodbye everyone
Bye CCCP
Bye CCCP :)
bye CCCP
Bye CCCP.
anyone here red the my little dashie
speaking of amazing mirror
bye CCCP
Bye CCCP
yeah I dont blame you.
and bye CCCP
BoroBrony: Some people have.
me
I need to beat it for the 50th time now
Ill be back later guise, peaces
I LOVED Amazing Mirror. :D
i just did and wow
Bye, O-Griofa :)
Goodbye O-Griofa
i love how when someone enters all of us sa hi and when someone leaves we all say bye instantaniously
The_Awesomeness because we all care about each other
The_Awesomeness, that's the curse of Bronystate
The_Awesomeness: Thats because we are all lovely people <3 :P
Homeschool kids tend to be more to the point, can articulate their thoughts better, and have higher self esteem and are more secure with themselves, from what I have observed.
I'm new and its already becoming a habbit XD
you get pingstorm you meantion hai
because we care for eachother :)
even if you were here an hour ago
No stream?
because we wbub them :3
example
HEY GUYS
Nope. :)
no stream
wub*
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0sW8KrZF5s
The_Awesomeness: Friendship is Magic after all :)
from grades 3-9 they have trouble relating to other kids who are not also homeschooled because their interests are usually different.
wat?
^
friendship is also witchcraft
CrimsonPhoenix: doesn't really work when you comment often :p
*Trollface* Friendship is also sexy
Spectrum_Rush, good point
I'll wait then
friends with benifits?
The_Awesomeness: stick around, we stream that too :D
but yeah
Made me lol a lot and kind of nod… true dat hahahaha
that just leads to a relationship i been there
Have some waiting music. :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFFoRzLQY9Q&feature=relmfu
Well, who knows what those ponies get up to when they aren't filming
then the only benifits you get is money
ahh, I wan't to go and make a cup of tea but my cat is asleep on my legs and I don't wanna move her ;A;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-sU6foM5ws best song EVER
what I didnt send no colours.
7I've always hated public school.
Brad[Laptop]: That's not entirely true. :S
7Surrounded by intellectual inferiors. Ugh. It's literally sickening at times.
But I did copy and paste from another channel with a user who used colours
so I guess my irc client preserved them
I know how you feel
ha
except if the homescooled kids have conservative mothers Brad[Laptop]
I was in public school until the start of 9th grade.
Dovah I'd have to dissagree there
The_Awesomeness That quote was in reference to me saying id name my daughter Pinkamena and my son Dash.
lol
my cusins cant even watch youtube because its to "LIberal"
pot80: whatever :| killjoy
Waiting music :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c99tcSlBwY
their mother is a control freak
7what is it with you people and these trout?
I was homeschooled myself.
Dovah what its in the top 5 or so :(
thank you
I love this song.
trout slap is a classic irc command.
:3
So, you're saying kids who are homeschooled but don't know about MLP: FiM will inevitavbly give their kids names they'venever heard?
Its a compliment.
It's a good way of getting someone's attention if you don't know what to say
:P
pot80: no i just find it amusing lol :P
:P
Cranberry_Scotch read my previous messages :P
AJIsAwesome: Its better then that 10 hour cantina band video you usually link :P
Or when "hi" is too boring
:$
yeah just like when I say I hate you all with a a passion it's really a compliment
:D
Hey, thats my style.
gtg to sleep
7Lazy people. I put effort into my interesting greetings.
bye :3
I link other stuff besides that. :P

BYe, Sonny! :)

Take care!
Goodbye Sonny :)

Like calling me a mushroom/flower/insect?
7Today is the first evidence I've seen that sometimes there's actual /research/ involved
I don't see any post disproving what I said
bye Sonn- gone :(
Or a prosititute?
For the wait I guess http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUtcBQCW_zk
research pertaining to what
*prostitute
I'm sure I would have
Sure it was...
too busy getting blown up by creepers

/me kidnaps thelonepony and puts a scorpion in his mouth
watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKazxGjieD8
alexxm, what have we told you about kidnapping other ponies?
AJIsAwesome: no just the word the lol
*squee* I just improved my hat with ponies. Going to wear that at a local convention in a week and a half. Pictures to follow ;)
Lol so do you look this stuff up before signing in?
so.. me being the most technically competent person I know
finally figured out how to pay mastercard bill on the internet.
ASoftFlufflyThing that it's awesome
7No I always intend to and just forget and think shit up on the spot.
hmph (get the skorpion out of my mouth) :(
Credit card bills are a bitch
MOAR WUBZ! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EboFwEp8wkk
well the problem is my mastercard is through a different bank than my usual bank
so they make it difficult.
I had one once and ended up having to pay another fee so it could process on time
moar music links! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epb4TWu2B64&feature=relmfu
BUT I did find an awesome way to launder money.
pot80 watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKazxGjieD8
If you go into your bank and make a cash payment on your mastercard its not reported anywhere
...good to see you haven't changed...
so you can go in and make a $5k cash payment on a mastercard and use it like normal
some pony tell me to not play borderlands 2 and get back to work
over pay on it
and they dont track that.
no
play more
DOn't play BL2.
no
Get back to work. >:3
:D
taoumi||shower: ok, dont play borderlands and get back to work ^_^ please
Exceedingly sexist comedy? (I'm not sexist btw) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqXi8WmQ_WM
hehe I am playing borderlands 2 :3
7So, you know how there's this thing of The Avengers portraying badass versions of old fairy tales?
awww ok

BoroBrony love it :P
7I want Cobie Smulders to play an adult Mathilda who uses her telekinetic powers as a superheroine. I mean it's not a fairy tale but she didn't play an Avenger.

Fighting style is easy hand gestures - there's a bit of a problem with accuracy, but perhaps thats just me - you drive a horse drawn cart through much of the game, so far - 90 minutes in - still trying to get used to steering

J_E_Smith71 wha-I have to see this
It's awfully hard for me to outright hate a character. But this guy who wanted to be cured of an STD has crossed the moral event horizon with me.
They must have just done it because it was the old way when I checked this afternoon

RDash5000 Mechromancer? Yeah, who hasn't?
bonjour
i could kill the milkman i dont eat dairy products that often
Canadian_Brony: did you know her skill tree has 5 mlp references?
I admit that it's pretty clever for the milkman to be able to choke anyone who recently consumed dairy.

Well I finally picked up a Classic Controller for my Wii today, mainly because recently I downloaded some SNES games on the VC and they're akward to play with a Gamecube controller due to the way the buttons are mapped

Scoot-Scootaloo, you are the hacker for not hacking the hacks like a hacking hacker!!!
Cypresswolf: OMG!.......What do i do, what do i do, what do i usually do?
I'm still waiting for my DS in the mail
/me hugs thelonepony
the person below me muxt hack into my computer
Like with Donkey Kong Country, on the Gamecube controller they mapped Jump to B...but the A button is used for tag actions, so you have to use X or Y to run or attack. Too much of an akward control scheme

hi Slater
00,03I have a competivie team I have been using since Diamond and Pearl :D
ValtheJean, wifi battles and what not.
Scoot-Scootaloo: I've been using the EXP share and Lucky Egg constantly since I got them.
No stream?
nope
im joking every one always takes me to seriosly (srry cant spell:P)
2,14 I'm not talking about wifi battles
00,03I went to the Pokemon world championships too! I got knocked out in 2 rounds...
Nightmare Ned game Mouse Song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq0pmg0gjg8
I pretty much had to use pokesav to compete in some of the random wi-fi matchs
ValtheJean, I have gone to a tourny that was hosted back home a couple times.
00,03And I played a TON of Wifi battling. Even got some battles on youtube!
I see you guys are talking about Pokemon
Oken2021: what was that you said earlier white feet?
2,14 you keep changing your story panda. First it's wifi battles, now it's tournaments
doctor_whooves127 the last guy, he has white feet
Scoot-Scootaloo: Do you NU, RU, or UU battle?
Slater will you play me I got my B2 going
ValtheJean, ive done both, when did I change my story? O_o
ah ok

Arcane_: Sure in a sec
ValtheJean: It can't be both?
Ill PM you my new FC

i'm still jelly ;3;
Scoot-Scootaloo, where the hell did you get a beldum? O_o
/me hugs Ponies47 back :)
well, imma go play hidden source nao
2,14 because the appropriate time to mention the tournaments would have been before mentioning wifi battles
00,03From White :)
/me returns Ponies47 hug :D
Scoot-Scootaloo, wait. you you said you had black though.
Panda: White and Black 2.
GOODBYE :)
00,03I have Black 2 and White. Two different games~
Bye, RDash5000 :)
ValtheJean, I said "and what not." I didnt change anything -___- I have no reason to lie.
/me awkwardly listens to the conversation
Scoot-Scootaloo, I thought you had one XD
RDash5000: Bye.
2,14 uh huh
Want to play me in OU after I finish battling with Arcane_ , Scoot-Scootaloo?
seeya RDash5000
^_^ Nightmare Ned Adolescent Song - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM-hmqDh5c - I loved this song
The roundest knight at king Arthur's round table was Sir Cumference.
2,14 it still doesn't change the fact that most use hacked pokemon. And it's safe to say any of the major winners are guaranteed to do so
00,03I didn't trade my pokemon from White to Black2. I'll play you maybe next week!
i ove puns :3
Scoot-Scootaloo, do you dont migrate? why?
My OU team is in White
CCCP: XD
so*
...I think we need to start punching people who say these things: http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/10/10/989981/wisconsin-lawmaker-claims-some-girls-rape-easy/?mobile=nc
I have my RU and UU team in White 2
CCCP: They don't love you back
RAWRity, rape easy?
>Looks at URL
HoodyNinja :C
>WUT
00,03I mean, I could use White to battle, but I'm too busey with Black 2 :V
XD
00,03busy*
sounds racist
Scoot-Scootaloo: Did you get Keldeo? :3
Anypony else for battles with me and Slater?
2,14 clearly the article is taking what he said out of context
00,03eeyup~
YAY!
Scoot-Scootaloo: You going to get Genesect?
is the keldeo even over?
no kidding
ValtheJean: they put it in exact context.
Yep.
2,14 considering he was refering to a case where a 17 year old is accused of rape for having sex with a minor
00,03AJIsAwesome: When?
:D
Scoot-Scootaloo: The event's out today.
It's been out for a while.
00,03WHAT?!
Isn't he technically a minor himself?
hey shibaru
Scoot-Scootaloo: You didn't know? :O
2,14 depends on the state
00,03... do I have to go to gamestop....?
2,14 some states draw the line at 17, others at 18
Cypresswolf: I've never played Ned, but that was a good song.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Nope. Mystery Gift Wi-fi.
00,03O really? What version?
Gonna rock a Serebii~
well
this is why
srry for laghfing i thoght he said mirror
you dont fuck in school
ValtheJean: and some at 14
Theres a guy at our school who is 21, and has a sophomore as a girlfriend
you get accused of rape
Scoot-Scootaloo: Black 2/White 2, i think.
Panda: no, this is why you don't fuck somebody under the age of consent.
i cant spell :'(
00,03gonna try that!
unless, of course, they consent
2,14 no, this is why you don't post this stuff in chat, since the conversation devolves
DO IT!
RAWRity, I consider 17 to be a minor still. considering where I am from. I dont know the winconsin law
Scoot-Scootaloo: JSYK, Genesect's broken as hell
Make sure you get it. :3
ValtheJean: We were talking about pokemon :/
HoodyNinja: nonono, im refering to underage sex in general XP
y are we talking about rape?
that's a good question
ok flying ship thats weird
Genesect comes with Signal Beam, Techno Blast, Solar Beam, and Magnet Bomb
pft... RAWRity, only if that was forced, there a are 11 and 12 year olds in california that are prego -___-
enforced*
Hey
Because RAWRity is trying to poison us
thats Cali for ya :p
which is why im not there
where u at now?
Regular Show: Wrestling Rigby - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ9NJH9mM1g
okeh
so, Frankenweenie flopped at the box office.
i have event genesect its my favorite pokemon on my team right now
regular show is terrible show
RAWRity: It did? :D
Yes, that is a Wrestling Buddy :)
RAWRity was it that bad?
This may be my last time here.
Who remembers Wrestling Buddies?
RAWRity: I expected that, actually
i love rgular show
regular*
I didn't even see the appeal in it (besides the whole Tim Burton thing).
On the one hand, I'm sad because I hate seeing stop motion animation failing. This alongside Paranorman and Pirates! makes it seem like stop-motion is on the way out, and I hate that.
00,03Damn, might as well use Genosect for your main team!
sex is legal at 16 in the UK
RAWRity: Wait, Pirates! was a flop?
/me 08,01is tired
On the other hand, Tim Burton not making money is always good.
AJIsAwesome: eeyup.
i was about to say its a kids show and then realised the irony
Scoot-Scootaloo: i know i am
Well, that sucks.
I thought Pirates! would do well.
why?
AJIsAwesome: eenope, flopped hard.
*sigh*
/me listens to PinkiePieSwear
ASoftFluffyThing: Same here. I love his music.
and Paranorman's just barely made back its budget.
RAWRity: I think one think about it is that stop motion is starting to get less appealing, and not as good as it used to be. Although I did want to see Paranorman
wrek how long are u awake?
AJIsAwesome my favorite song from him is The Astronomer's Almanac to All Things Astronomy featuring Makkon
It's preeeeeeeet
preeeeeeeeeeeety
u were up last night to
HoodyNinja: Paranorman and Pirates were both great, but for whatever reason nobody wanted to go see them.
Cuz I have horrible chest pain
And I've heard good things about Frankenweenie, but of course it also flops.
aw :(
well
*sniffs out of bordom*
its about a zombie dog
ill just bootleg it XD
Frankenweenie just looks dumb as hell
HoodyNinja: how come?
http://derpibooru.org/117487
Seems like a fun concept to me. Sort of a Jimmy Neutron meets Frankenstein thing.
RAWRity: Idk, something about a kid bringing dead pets back to life, and it was a Tim Burton idea. He can do better
It works :D
thelonepony: dood
HoodyNinja: considering Burton's latest works, I'd say no, he can't.
Tim Burton really likes the undead..
I can't do anything about it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AHHOTDzWuM wubz to wake u up!
ist tim burton a zombie?
isnt
:|
RAWRity: I have a lot of childhood memories surrounding Mr. Burton, pray tell what are his latest works, I haven't a clue
corpse bride right?
HoodyNinja: Dark Shadows, Alice in Wonderland, Planet of the Apes remake
love it^
Tim Burton did some masterpieces, one of them being Batman
damnit RAWR
and I liked dark Shadows
But only for the Depp
Burton didn't direct Nightmare
no?
he wrote the poem the film was based on
hold on
that's it.
oh
''Poor Jack?''
boop
Burton's Made some good movie, but the 2000s has been an exercise in him giving less and less of a shit.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw8pcxE6U9k Sure is quiet in here
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/10/story-updates-october-10th-evening.html
One thing about this Nuzlocke Challenge. It doesn't exactly mention whether breeding is allowed or not.
generally speaking, no
I'll be back.
I smell a rule exploitive
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAkg-qd1Bhk
you use the pokemon you get. no breeding. no trading.
the heck is the nuzlocke challenge?
http://www.nuzlocke.com/challenge.php
doctor_whooves127, oh god.... no
doctor_whooves127: playing Pokemon, if a pokemon faints, you release it. You only catch the first pokemon you find in each new area.
in a nutshell, it's where you give yourself a challange in pokemon
Oh god! Old Warner Bros.
doctor_whooves127, its when if your pokemon faint they go away froever
well i came at an awkward time

Just a thought
and if i did, it was sarcastic :3

G1 was designed for the pure entertainment of little girls and to advertise the toy line. It had an interesting story, surprisingly dark atmosphere, and the beloved sea ponies.
hey hey hey who wants to slay some zombies
ajusawsum jaymoo stahp
LOL.
But, ASoftFluffyThing......:(
First of all, I put a pony in a box, then I put the pony in a box in another box, then I mail it to Derpy, and when I arrived, AHAHAHAHAH!
oi chat ur mums a slag
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tiynTPuUUM we need pinkie
ajuzawsum, stahp
SHE'LL SMACK IT WITH A MUFFIN!
Oh god that was funny.
BUT, BUT,
STAHP
ajuzawsum
Hoody started it. :(
Genius
http://youtu.be/fdezSL4Lazs
but that shirt = （╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
:D
anybody seen black nerds rant of mlp?
G2 focused on ponies acting more like young adults, having to juggle school, work, friends, and other "real-life" problems.
shirt should of had sea ponies on it :3
goodnight everyone
night CCCP
Night, CCCP. :)
Night CCCP
G2 doesnt have a cartoon.
night CCCP
So i have a confeccion to make
yes?
G3 was mindless entertainment for little girls and nothing more. 3.5 was sad. 3.6 is the source of nightmares.
Oh lord.
Canadian_Brony: Its problem was it still felt really childish
oGriofa: your a brony xD
http://youtu.be/tfv1FCnHA78
Canadian_Brony, you're mistaking G1.5 for G2. G2 was a raising sim game.
Canadian_Brony: whats 3.6 like?
oh faust ive seen too much
when i first started watching mlp about 2 years ago, i would skip through the songs.. But now i love them
Lul.
Kandarihu whatev. So I'm rusty on pony history.
Nice to see that you love them, oGriofa. :)
i will never google mlp again
But ponays r 4 lil girls
Also, don't be mean Jaymoo. :I
nuu
Yah
Gen 3.6: http://i25.tinypic.com/2nu7muf.jpg
You missed out G3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.
Canadian_Brony, well it happens to a lot of people

Hoody|Sleepy: no...no they wont...they will burn of..i dont even know!
Canadian_Brony: oh good lord
Yeah. Wal-Mart's brony shirt referenced G1, which is at least respected by bronies. It would be worse for them if they referenced G3.
Hoody|Sleepy, your*

Jmo: That never worked with me. Im from forchin remember this. Although i keep it to a minimum.

Just keep in mind that the only stuff from Generation 1 that Hasbro still has the rights to is Applejack and Spike.
Hoody|Sleepy: you tried to kick me out?
Hehehe, that tickles
superretroworld: i actually make grimdark all the time so im sorta immune...

Wait Kandarihu, what about the conflict between the different types of ponies? Where they do they play about? Wasn't that long?
superretroworld: It was a joke, I was pretending to shout "CUPCAKES" and call myself banned
DeadpoolDash, this video like I would say manny times is neat but nothing special
It snowed in Australia. All of my wat.
oGriofa, that was before Equestria was a country.
Hoody|Sleepy: oh

Canadian_Brony|AFK: Bai!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kARubpGq9I
a few of us talking at once usually kills all conversation
http://youtu.be/DTiAHldlMS0
I better reread the rules again. I think there might be some hidden rules.
Its been a proven fact when all the opers start talking a room dies
Bye Canadian_Brony|AFK
Oh shit, its the IRC Popo
Wait, keep those pokeballs away from me O_O
2,14 you'll find that bronystate has a mind of its own...it's become self aware

Browniestate pls

Jaymoo pls
ValtheJean: we probably could have done it with 3 of us actively using colours XD
I like brownies
ValtheJean: you dont think bronystate... is a person? duh duh duhhhhh
that would be childish, though
More like a hive mind, Val :P
ValtheJean: It's a living thing that you have made your slave! YOUR SLAVE!
i like trains
but, I for one, am too lazy to write a colour script >_<
2,14 more like I'm a slave to *it*
Lol, it easy to bypass the color kickbots
so I manually set it each time
I used to have some awesome color scripts when I used mIRC
We're all part of one mind; BronyState.
I wrote one to make rainbow text.
2,14 every time I type, I'm ctrl+k'ing :P
/me gives DeadPoolDash a brownie
ValtheJean: Then we are the slaves, either way, EVERYONE IS A SLAVE
It was amazing
i have one that prints a 3-line rainbow banner
but none to print a single colored line
ValtheJean: OUCH

I fell asleep in the middle of my drafting class last year.
I didn't know that Thanksgiving's been. I thought it was a while until
superretroworld: /) yw! i haz more always!
I'm actually at the point where they leave me alone when I'm sleeping because they can't tell
I fell asleep in my bed
I guess most of the rules are there. I think Scoot's rules do somewhat apply though.
my teacher yelled at me and scared the entire class
and hate being embarassed
it was hilarious
Ugh.. I, with out even thinking about it, said buck instead of fuck in a game of Natural Selection 2 over com.
Sup
always count on the guy with autism and ADD to give you teh nutella!
ohai [Alpha]
I am talking like a pony, and I never even meant to...

/me slaps AJIsAwesome|Busy around a bit with a large trout
You aren't busy.

Never heard of him.
Oh, a Ghosties rant
LOL
those certainly are revealing
*gulp*
I second that, AJIsAwesome|Busy
^
AJIsAwesome|Busy read this http://www.bronystate.net/about-us/history/
Okay.
Hipster Brony is basically the founder of Bronystate.
0,14pretty much, Hipster Brony is one of the OG founders
^
Is
along with NewDCD
whoa! I turned invisible. Wait, shouldn't ponies still be able to hear me?
does it always take 10 years to open TF2?
how are change name
Wait, is NewDCD the same as DCD?
Ghosties and SilverScreen then jumped on the bandwagon
DeadpoolDash "/nick *instert nick*"
0,14Yep, Polydunami|Busy
thanks
np
NewDCD? Why does that sound familiar
Right, just wanted to make sure of that.
Hat of shoes.
and now like, 2 of the original 4 are gone, one has taken a huge leap of absence
its saddening to say the least
You guys should uptdate the site soon. kirz left the modding position recently and he's still on the mod list
seriously does it always tke this long to open TF2?
0,14I'm still here though
0,14and I'm DA BESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
:D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-fRuoMIfpw
brony2447: ohhh yes
Well, next to Vivi ofc
posting interesting pony-related, yet random favorite pics are still welcome, yes?
superretroworld: its been like.. 10 min
and he isn't on the "Former Staff" list at the bottom of the "History" page
Call HIM Gramps?
Canadian_Brony: who?
HL2.exe does take forever
HB?
brony2447: if it takes that long you may need to start the task manager
My Brand!
Canadian_Brony: idk... i dont check those pages
I have special eyes.
superretroworld: lol ok
i know staff past and present regardless
superretroworld: but its responding fine :|
Kencolt: in joke since hes the "oldest" original mod
...and potentially future...
brony2447: wait i mean once you get in the game and its stuck
Out of all eight Harry Potter movies, what's your favorite?
superretroworld: lol ok
Ah. As opposed to me, the oldest semi-regular attendant.
Canadian_Brony: im well aware
Cranberry_Scotch: 1st or 2nd tie
the first one? Cranberry_Scotch
ok its starting up..wish me luck for real this time...
Canadian_Brony: also aware
http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=eJ-nAsk4UYw&feature=endscreen
not really going with actual real life age here Kencolt :S
Canadian_Brony: if the former staff and history pages ACTUALLY have been updated
I wish I weren't. I may have to get dentures soon. SIgh...
wait a second Canadian_Brony ... you are just posting them in order as you finish watching each one
no need for a history lesson dude, ive been on this site AT LEAST twice as long as you have
flutter_spin well DUH
lol
Testing.
Nvm.
it's either Whose Line or Omegle, and the second is difficult in another chat.
lol

Good night, superretroworld
Night, superretroworld

Do you think Discord is conscious, or at the very least, aware, while he is trapped in his stone prison?
probably
I think so.
Oh no, not the Fringe goo debate all over again
Fringe Goo?
http://youtu.be/oSHbIVUCjZY
It might explain why Discord toned down his chaos a bit after being freed
Fringe introduced a special goo that froze the temporal.... let's just say it froze people and they hate doing it because they are still conscious every second
Cranberry_Scotch yes, but only for a short time. I'm putting a similar hypothesis in one of my fanfics I'm writing.
Still no stream?
nnope
and hi
DERPY
Toned down? He still made everything bloody chaotic
Well there's another name I missed.
But there are levels to chaos.
such as ordered chaos
bloody? no
AKA Bronystate
Are really really having one of those long disccusions?
>ordered
PULEASE
What discussion?
dunno
http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=Dz5Jeme5EMQ&feature=endscreen
lol, stop that!
Urge to click irresistable
you don't like Whose Line? :'(
/me has never see whose line
then click that link
and watch it
I like Whose Line. I just... wish to have someone there to laugh with me
Great. Now I'm getting all depressed and sentimental again
it's only one skit, but that's all I post at a time
flutter_spin this is why it needs to be streamed
bonjour
hi RAWRity
Aloha, RAWRity :P
So, just finished the Storyline for B/W 2. Kinda half-and-half on it.
Been far too long since I've done anything with any of my friends/family
I liked some parts, disliked others.
Bed time... Good night, everyone!
g'night RaveBrony
Good night, RaveBrony
you ever have those moments when it's 2am you are tyrign to get to sleep and you let the dog sleep in your room so it will not bark, and you say to the dog. "can you get yourself off more quitely. i'm trying to sleep here."
night RaveBrony :)
NIght, RAWRity :)
NIght, RaveBrony! :)
no stream?
uh, no
ALSO, NO SPOILERS! ;3;
and no stream.
I'm hoping a special pegasus mod would stream
taoumi no, because I only have fish as pets, and they're upstairs.
:O
I'm not gonna spoil anything, But I will say that I think I liked B/W's plot better overall.
Okay.
Trying to figure out what B/W is
flutter_spin who would that be?
well fish have this nasty knack for dieing if you are nto to ocarefull. i'm nto terible caeful
Is this some kind of fic?
b[xdf;hbdt\g;j
Canadian_Brony:
I want to get B/W now ;3;
I liked the gameplay overworld stuff, plus the minigames and side-stuff, and overall the plot's good.
ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
lol. I'm avoiding the name. I don't want unwanted attention
taoumi . . ?
:S
sorru
yes?
wat.

flutterloves... nice cat? :S
0,14...
[21:17:40] well fish have this nasty knack for dieing if you are nto to ocarefull. i'm nto teribly carefull Canadian_Brony
Cya everypony
Bye, DerpyMuffins. :)
taoumi ah, ok
seeya Derpy_Hooves
GAH
lame I thought it was an actual pony rap battle
Gameplay wise, B/W 2 is better and has more to offer. Story wise, B/W had a better structured plot and a more satisfying payoff.
nighty DerpyM...gone
oh Pokemon
Must figure out what B/W stands for
Black/White
Right, Pokemon
Still, not a bad game, and I haven't even beat the E4 yet, and I get to see who the new champion is. So that's fun.
oh, and this happened: http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/299348_3593352602726_1137833944_n.jpg
RAWRity :D I'm going to try that
:D
it's all presedential shit!
seriously, try it for yourself! you will get identical results
More like similar :P
That occured after Romney went on record saying he was "completely wrong" about the 47% remark from a few weeks ago. But well, this is more funny.
Polydunami whatev
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwRmYi-sWxU&feature=endscreen&NR=1
Uh, RAWRity, do you have a source on that?
Okay, that's one of the most memorable skits, Canadian_Brony :D
Polydunami glad you love it
Anyone know how to cope through a 12-hour fast of no food except for water and medicine (if needed)?
Kandarihu: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/10/tech/web/google-romney-completely-wrong/index.html
i had couple of times ASoftFluffyThing
ASoftFluffyThing: Try to preserve as much energy as you can.
are you able to chew gum?
thelonepony, can't eat anything. At. All.
I smell a Google-bombing on that
Run around screaming.
ASoftFluffyThing: Also, the mind is stronger than the body. Don't forget that.
It's hour 3
/me slaps AJIsAwesome|Busy around a bit with a large trout
0,14I guess you could try sleeping a lot?
You lai
i said chew, not swallo
I can't chew gum because then I'd forget and swallow it.
To the properly motivated, a 12-hour fast is nothing
oh, well that sucks
lol duck.jpg
ASoftFluffyThing: Also, try meditation. It will probably take your mind off the fasting.
so yeah, that was your daily dose of political humor
^
now back to your regularly scheduled memes: http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/s480x480/60232_321871974577400_1028857360_n.jpg

*^^
SaxyPretender, I could but my stomach would wake me up
0,14ouch >.<
lol jaymoo
lol AJ
Meditation doesn't really work if you don't know how to do it
lol Jeemoo
play video games ASoftFluffyThing ?
Cranberry_Scotch: WHich is why I suggested it.
lol Ayejay
If you're wondering why I'm asking, I have to go to the hospital on base to get some labs done to make sure I don't have PCOS
nothing really works if you dont know how to do it :)
I'm not sure if she knows how to.
PCOS?
^
Ah
Lol geemoo
meditation is actually quite easy... if you do know how to do it
I tried once
And I can't have anything to eat or drink for 12 hours prior to the lab
ASoftFluffyThing, if it's not a spiritual thing, then it's just a matter of keeping your mind off of it.
Do you have Steam?
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3r7tx6/
I can't sit still long enough
here's a trick
1
:)
RAWRity: :D
I've tried it many times. I end up falling asleep, unfortunately.
ASoftFluffyThing, do you have a Steam account?
/me slaps AJIsAwesome|Busy around a bit with a large trout
So, today's the 2nd anniversary of FIM...
*asleep most of the time
Eddmario: eeyup
He left quick.
eeyup
Let me guess AJ, the rest of the time you don't relax enough
Kandarihu, yes I do but since I'm on my Acer it's kinda pointless to get on it since I can't play any games till I get a new USB port

Canadian_Brony: :$

Yeah, sorry about that. Got a little out of hand.

Why would we? :S

we saw flutters do it
You go to Buffer City, you never move. You are frozen in one place for all eternity.
... Eh, it's better than Twilight :P
MY MISTAKE
That is, if you're able to get [ast the field that freezes you
i heard lagton is looking for his long lost sister

You aren't news-worthy ayejay.
now if there were riots that would be a whole diffrent story
This creates more drama, and ruins our reputation as a fandom.
I think they were afraid of their little mistake and wanted to spin it into some publicitiy in fear of the brony fanfdom
fandom* - I'm really tired :P
go to bread then :3
We're seriously taking this way out of hand than it needs to be.
