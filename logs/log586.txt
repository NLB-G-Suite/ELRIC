Alright, well, I don't think I'll stick around for the episode in full. Probably just long enough for the rest of the song here...

DOODLE
Come on and SMILE! :D
I'm headin' out, too! Later all y'all!
The Persona series also involves a lot of social interaction.
hehehe
Persona 3 and 4 are social simulator/random dungeon crawls
Cya MrBen :)
SMT in general is also really hardcore.
no
Dammit, Pinkie, I'LL be your friend!
When your mother names you Crankly it's not like you have many options in life
ah
THOSE BLUE eyes.
argh
Felt
I hate SMT
U MAD Donkey?
I HATE SMT
epic animation
dat logic
I hate it so damn much
lol, felt art
dat felt
I've played the first one (at least, until my ROM broke) and damn that game was brutal until you got the hang of it
dat 4th wall break
11,01Buzz :<
4TH WALL WHERE DID IT GO?
4TH WALL YOUR BREAKING THE 4TH WALL
like that felt
I'm just glad Ingram worked his charm on the song and we didn't get Amy Keating Rogers' original version
ponies carrer choices are determined at birth
She felt like thinking over the situation :O
can you uncheck something you didn't check yet?
SMT?
the design, the premise the soundtrack the IF YOU DO NOT DO IT THIS WAY YOU WILL FAIL bullshit
nooo! dont do it-
check!
lol
00,02i dont get it either
0,14Shin Megami Tensei
4th wall check
4th wall Shattered! :O
give the cute pick one a hug dammint
AJ: Not true.
/me CHECK!
it's goddamn pokemon with demon'
D: she broke it
00,02how could you not be bff's with pinkie
its gone
her mind is made of felt
/me 11,01checks Dark92Enigma
This is an episode where a pony's element of harmony is actually a detriment.
what 4th wall?
Pinkie's talent is parties, but she's training to be a baker.
A-GAME
the game is also punishingly difficult
damn that Bouncy Bounce
:)
I hope MLP has 4th wall insurance
laughter is best element
you'd thinking with how often pinkie breaks the 4th wall one should just be able to reach into the screen eventually
it just makes her cuter
Is that the online game?
no
DAT Pinkie Moonwalk
Her desire to make friends causes more harm then good, and it only gets fixed in the end.
I honestly didn't like Rogers' original tune from the song, aside from Derpy originally having a line in it
but there was a SMT online game
Rarity's talent is finding gems, but she's a dress designer.
0,14SMT is an overall brand
tired, grammar failing
yes, I played that game
not sure if it's dead or not
night everyone, be carefull pinky might get out og your screen tonight
Dont be cranky Captain Ginyu
Seduction!
but yeah, Persona 3 and 4 are in the same universe
I will brook no comparisons between Pokemon and SMT, otakon.
suggestive
and somewhat linked
0,14Persona series
DocSane: I think she's into catering, which involves both baking and putting on parties
damn the bounces
0,14Catherine
Pinkie, stop being so CUTE <3
meh
Dexster's Lab
heehaww. PISS OFF KID
CHECK!
If you compare the two again I will be forced to wait waht
Seductive wink
Reikim: dude, you recruit demons in SMT: Nocturne to fight with you
DEE DEE
Catherine takes place in the Persona universe?
tee hee hee
and seductive
She's the live embodiement of Dee Dee
0,14yeah
I don't think so
HEEHEEHEE
00,02^
0,14it's a Catherine spinoff
0,14*Persona spinoff
no
Gawd. He actually keeps wind chimes.
WELCOME
Haven't played that either
otakon: Through talking to them. And the entire battle system is different. And the premise.
OMG! she is JUST like dee dee...
Dang missed the smile song due to net going down
0,14Vincent cameos in the P3P
11,01A welcome wagon!
awwwwwww

Pinkie would be Dee Dee's favorite Pretty Puff Pony.

TheGreatAndPowerfulT: /)
SaxyPretender: and it's not suprising
And when did you ever use that wagon before Pinkie?
I love Disgaea
/me based the birthday song off the welcome wagon song
MICROWAVE PARTY CANNON
I've got Disgaea 2. Still got to finish that...
0,14like I said, he cameos in the PSP version of P3
AttacktheAndalite: :o
SaxyPretender: yeah
Phase4: only when you refuse to be her friend
Barney Approves The Last Line of this Song

BALD BALD
the horror
0,14still a cameo
Phase4, when I saw this episode the first time, it redeemed her in my mind from being annoying. Now she's coming across as annoying in this episode.
SaxyPretender: it's just that, a cameo
Dov: Yeah.
Bison: This is delisious
AGAIN
the horror
dear god thats creepy still
"again"
AttacktheAndalite: Ah

VenHur96: Dat Spongebob movie ref

Disgaea is another game series I need to look into >_<
the Soldier in Borderlands? one of his kill messages is "Nailed it!"
Persona takes a completely different tack from the originals
with the EXACT same inflection that Pinkie gives it
STAT
DAT ASS
DocSane: 0.o
Pinkie, you're making it worse.
love the spa twins
Yeah I know I was playing as the soldier today.
11,01He's bald, but he has hair up there.
she's hyper, doesnt quite get when she's gone too far, and loves cakes
11,01Bald is a relative term.
they always look so happy
0,14gotta check TV Tropes for that again
There was that recent one with the marines...

Eeyore was cheerier than this guy.

Fighting game with 40 hours of story. See: Dissidia
2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2........you HAVE FAILED ME BRAIN!
11,01*Brilliant!
even if you play each one it shouldn't take more than 2 hours to beat one campaign.
I bet P4A is something like Dissidia.
2 and 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 and 2

well still
i want to play the last remant again but my xbox is dead...
hehe, The Grand Galloping Gala
OohShiny: That
repeat fights
why did see not put the note infront of the door, the dumb arse
Clearly otakon just sucks at fighting games.
I like Matilda's pony tail

Squallken: iknowright?
04And then the real world hit Cranky and he was enlightened to the terrible cruelty that is existence. Great, ain't it bronies?
but that is not the point.
Good, now that that's cleared

If I ever have to answer 2+2+2 on a test I am going to write Matilda. However, since I'm not in 1st grade the odds of that happeniong are pretty slim

Ear boner
it's got a small roster and you have to fight guys like 3 or 4 times over the course of the game, it's articial lengthening.

So great

There's more than one fighter out there that is just girls in cosplay ourfits.
NO! NO SHPPINGS!
*outfits
cratorkid: Never saw a non-hetero marriage in ponyville.
dat eye twinkle
There's actualyl a fighter called Cosplay Fighter, I think.
Phase4: plugged my old CRT into my new PC and dragged IRC over to it so I can watch it while I game :D:D
cratorkid: And so it was a historical moment
0,14yeah, I've heard of it
XAX: nice
And then there's DoA

0,14see, you want to talk about focusing on breasts? go to DOA

cratorkid: Not that I'm opposed to that?
lol
0,5xD
this needs more ponies
YES!
What was that?
YES!
Which is sad because I think there's a story under there.
oh boy it's this again
but at least they were upfront about it
He's marrying SCOUT'S MOM
lol
instead of trying a half ass story mode
0,5This is actually neat
0,14so much that, when they were making DOA5, one of the interviews were like "don't worry, we're downplaying the boob physics"
There is no non-upfront fanservice
As you can tell. I really like this video :P
oh dear lord
O_O
0,14guess who didn't do that, SCV
All fanservice is upfront
PIEH
OKay, no sea ponies. I'm going to bed.
no I mean they didn't try to disguise it
Night, all.
You cannot be coy about fanservice.
/me dies from laughter
It's there or it isn't.
not that it wasn't upfront
If itagaki was still there it would be different
Wait, I bet some of you hadn't seen this yet...

IT'S OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ah
00,03Evenin' Ponies~
0,14NOT by Namco's in-house studio
Everyone should be able to read, but not write, content unless they are clearly intelligent human beings.
Even you, otakon, should be able to tell, just by reading, that Saxy loves his fghting games.
Oh, Bayonetta
the chick who's suit is her GODDAMN HAIR
evenin' Scoot-Scootaloo
Fun game that makes me laugh
pumpkin!
Pumpkin
and when she does summons she gets naked
Bayonetta is one of those games that's not meant to be taken seriously.
xD
dat PONY DANCE
And that concludes your Alliszero "0 faith in humanity" moment for the night.
what pumpkin?
she also has ridiculously long legs
put on ba ass hat and strike a POSE
How is she getting this stuff?
sexy long legs......
0,14I dunno, I think there's a lot of depth in bayonetta
LOL
well yeah I must admit the game itself is not bad
otakon y u take seriously evrything?
It's also a lot harder than it first appears
there is, but its also silly
I'm a RPG gamer
Alpha-Omega - because Woona
Ohoho
0,14one of those games that lends itself to feminist critique
PUMPKIN, WHAT? PUMPKIN, PUMPKIN WHAT!? PUMPKIN WHAT!?
What kinds of RPGs?

You're pretty sure there has never been a pumpkin
0,5Ive seen this, too cute :D
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
*ding!*
You don't critique Bayonetta. You laugh yourself silly at it.
0,14if I was a bit more educated and a lot less lazy, I wouldn't mind writing an essay examing it
ding
stuff like Dragon Age
00,02RAWRity, cleverbot is jensen
*DING*
so am i otakon i don't see the isuee
looks like a creepy face
Bayonetta's weird, though. In a lot of ways it objectifies women, but in others it empowers them.
For a second, I thought we're crossing over to Transformers territory.
charlie brown
0,14^
JarlBaconTheGreater: seen the second yet?
0,14stuff like that I wouldn't mind exploring
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I suck balls at games that require twitch skills
Derpy was here...
THE CAVE IS A LIE
Portal 2 too
lies..
00,10Damn Phase4, dickJenson would have been a great bot name
lol
The Cave is a Lie...LAWL
0,14did that with Red Dead Redemption
You could take the Lumen/Witch conflict as a conflict between masculine ego and natural female strength, or something of the sort.
No, Portal 1
rattman ws here
aww I was going to say that
the original issue is HOW they can make a 40 hour story mode for a FIGHTING GAME
00,02Sumica, it would be
LOL
Oh dang Woona dub
without it just being rehashed fights over and over
Dissidia Duodecim did it
This is bucking epic
Okay, there we go
0,14heck, her character design has an interesting story
mmyes
00,02Yes, Quite
That one's not hard.
*hard
by having you fight the same people over and over
YAY
yaay
It does indeed, Saxy
so you don't like it cause you suck at it and take your anger out with the game instead of trying to get better ?
since god forbid you only beat a character once and move on to the next.
dude I don't get better
otakon: Also Dissidia doesn't have a small roster. 22 goddamn fighters is not small.
I've praticed
and practiced
If you take the red pill, you can go home and believe what you want......if you take the blue pill, you'll turn into Nightmare Moon and try to bring eternal night.........MACHINES!
and practiced
lol
You just suck. End of story.
BLUEBLOOD...
0,14your mindset is probably not in the right place
and have shown no improvement
lol
Hahaha
Nice answer.
"You just suck"
still no reason to take it out with the game
I'm not
DAMMIT BLUEBLOOD
It's not just practice, though. You have to read up.
:D
Find techniques.

Learn combos and such.

0,14tbh, I think it's important to learn good defense first
Example: Melee. Learning wavedashing and SHFFLing can make your game.
but HOW can they make a 40 hour story mode for a goddamn FIGHTING GAME with only 12 characters without you having to beat the same people over and over?
0,5WHAT!? ..... Whatever Fuck this!
That too

Final Fantasy Music was awesome

there is no progression in a fighting game

lol
socks are sexy
0,14so?
BA DUM TSS
seriously, you would fight 11 other people at a time
You fight the same people, but as you fight them your character improves.
how fucking long would it take to beat 11 guys?
rpgs arent the only games that can have long stories otakon....
:D
dem socks
0,14BBCT has 12 characters and it had a fleshed out story?
So as you fight, you unlock more skills, etc, etc
DEM SOCKS
lol
socks a fo yo feet silly
Socks! Socks everywhere!
11,01It was a real question asked by me!
shouldn't take longer than an hour to beat 11 other fighters.
0,5What did you ask?
that's 12 hours
Where are the socks?
0,14I mean, look at SF
RAWRity: Thank god for that too
SF?
where the hell do they get the other 28 hours?
0,14it has a huge ass roster, and its story is pretty shit
Street Fighter
Do ho ho!
Aha
11,01http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1mslrGGh11r757rdo1_500.png <- This plus two others I can find.
CriticKitten: ?
Anyway, lots of dialogue and cutscenes
yeah even I know that
when you learned to SPELL YOUR NAMES!

dat YAY
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
11,01I'd like to voice those questions I asked, but I dunno if he'll let me do that.
0,14and that's without dialouge
Oh boy
oh THAT is why
that equals 55 minutes....
the key element of the blog
0,14without the possibility of branching paths
it's filler
11,01Shower.
it's dialogue filler
That hat needs to be a skin for the Manniversary Paper Hat in TF2
CriticKitten: I think Decaprio's a pretty good actor myself
Or not damn
0,14>advancing plot
Pardon me it's late
hat.
00,02Yeah!
0,14>filler
granted his career started out as a teen pretty boy
I want to trade for that hat!
So...what is this?
toast!
it's 12 hours of gameplay and 28 hours of dialogue with branching paths
So yes, one hour to beat 11 guys if you're goof.
otakon, you know nothing.
weedle shoos
wittle shoes
05wittle shues ftw
but once Scorcese got ahold of him, he got pretty good.

I'm a gamer first and foremost
Buytoast: It's Moonstuck, a video adaptation of the interactive Tumblr
RAWRity: Decaprio borders between bad and good. He wouldn't work in the Batman movies.
Ah.
RPG gamer
otakon you play turn based rpg you can't outright complain about dialogue
So something I would be mocking viciously if i weren't in here?
Nowadays the distinction is important
lololol
0,5NYAME THE MACHEEN KNYEFFREY
lol
For people who saw Dark Knight Rises, is Robin in it?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: yeah true
Yes
It sucked
Eddmario: Not really?
o.e
CriticKitten: well, people said Ledger wouldn't work in the Batman movies...
And some kid went crazy and killed people
Also 13 character roster
Eddmario: yes and no
Technically the name is dropped but Robin himself never shows up.
Why the hates on Dark Knight Rises? I haven't seen it, but it's good.
OI! dont go there
0,14again, this is the next entry in the persona series
Nothing to be afraid of about Season 3 then
0,14Atlus is doing the writing
RAWRity: Ledger was a hell of a lot better actor. >_>
Should be good
I still don't see how a fighting game can have a 40 hour story mode without resorting to tactics like having to beat the same characters multiple times.
Persona has always been story-heavy
yes it has
0,14this is advancing the story, presumably to a persona 5
RAWRity AND GOOD GOOD THEY' WERE WRONG
Actually
ACTUALLY
I just realized
no spoiler about dark man rise
what?
Oh my god this is hilarious
WHAT DAMMIT!?
otakon is being a massive hypocrite.
I'm going to see it tomorrow
VenHur96: I was very pleased with Dark Knight Rises.
Dark Man.... heck ill watch it
oh really?
Dark Knight**

VAT A TVEEST
CrimsonPhoenix: Why?
please explain I'd like to hear this.
"Fighting the same character multiple times" = "crossing world map/level grinding/returning bosses"
I just said I'm going to watch it tomorrow
NO SPOILERS, PLEASE
/me laughs
It's a very good film. I think people expected something different.
yeah
i want to watch it for myself

0,14fun fact: you can in a fighting game
only in skill
you know, what with The Man of Steel and Dark knight, It seems like we're starting to get movies that don't say the hero's name in the title.
If you do like Dissidia
FORESHADOWING
dat chicken
chicken! :D
lol
Dissidia get that goddamn thing out of here!
it was scootaloo
0,14fights can be tweaked so that story elements are present
otakon seems to think fighting games cant have "rpg elements"
I LIKE CHICKENS EDDY!
NUUU NOT THE DIABEETUS
In a game like Dissidia, you get new powers and abilities as you go. Your skill also increases.
He's a Pirate makes every pirate dreams 20% cooler
RAWRity: Maybe it's a Nolan thing. Nolan's producing it.
oh god this part
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE
NOTHING ELSE
>Non-existent pumpkin
So, in fact, a carefully done fighting game can be far more rewarding than a JRPG
0,14there's a few fights in Blazblue where Jin and Ragna can't access moves because story
still, player skill =/=character ability
PUMPKIN WHAT!
Daaa.
Isn't it more important?
DA!
da
DAAAAAAA
o.o
Flash movie will be called "The Fastest man Alive". Wonder Woman will be "Princess of the Amazon". Martian Manhunter will be "J'onn J'onnz"
But I don't want to get into a "which is better" discussion here
Anyway
The thing is
X marks the spot
the point i have been trying to make
Yes you fight multiple times
да
Green Lantern 2 will be "In Brightest Day
"
But every time you fight, the characters are different, plot-wise.
RAWRity: Then Sonic can be "The Fastest Thing Alive"
No part 3?
is HOW can a fighting game, make a 40 hours story mode withougt repetitive fights?
00,10not yet
VenHur96 - not yet
/me notices a distinct lack of wubs till now
my ears
my poor ears
WUWUBUWUBWUBWUB
You know what
0,14is that such a bad thing?
i wasn't expecting this
CriticKitten: Nolan's also going to be a producer on the Batman reboot movie they're panning
00,10learn to auto balence
Yus! Dubstep!
what is this song
someone tell me the name of this song
ew Dubstep
i need it
RAWRity - SequelPan?
later all!
0,14it's one way to tell a story
aww i liked woona
/me turns up speakers
0,5This is frickin awesome
seriously, at WORST for the players that suck like me
Alpha-Omega: Fire Hive by Knife Party
2 hours per character
that's 26 hours
DUBSTEP HAS REACHED MLP OH GOD NOO
Sumi, gonna do the other wub?
how can a jrpg do it? oh wait, you still fight a ton of monster that are nearly the same cept for maybe recolors and different elements throughout, and thats not counting grinding
lol
Someday, I'm going to write a story, with just two characters fighting over and over, and it shall have depth and characterization and be 100 000 words long
WHAT I THE NAME OF THIS SONG, I SOOO WANT IT
LoveandTolerate - Odyssey.
LoveandTolerate: ...you must be new
RAWRity: I thought Nolan said he was done.
LoveandTolerate, it reach MLP since a long time ago
it's been here since... January 2011?
xx14andy4xx: Fire Hive by Knife Party
Just. To. Spite. You.
and Odyssey isn't Dubstep
CriticKitten: done directing, sure. But he's signed as a producer at least.
XD
go ahead
OK, I'm off everypony.....it's been fun............gotta see the Full ''Dark Crystal'' movie tomorrow.................bye
have fun with that
RAWRity: wouldnt really say new, i do my best to ignore dubstep
this.. isn't dubstep??
Fuck yeah I will
RAWRity: Got a link handy where he said he's going to do more Batman work?
=\
bleh... Eurobeat, Dubstep; not too far apart
0,5D:
And I'll do it with ponies too
bye
YES!
0,5WHYD YOU END IT
0,5>:I
LET YOUR HATE FLOW THROUGH YO!U
Cuz I had thought he pretty much said he wasn't touching Batman again.
because PINKIE'S BREW.
CriticKitten: plus, new Continuity for the eventual JLA movie
Reikim, whle it has more than 2 characters, you could use HnK as an example here
in RUSSIAN
>Russians
HnK?
?
0,5Forget pinkie's brew, I want that dubstep back!!!!
JarlBaconTheGreater: i belive it ends like that the vid
I speak russian :)
HOKUTO
thats as far as it goes
NO
KEN
Assuming they get that far, RAWRity.
AKA
OH YEAH
oh
most convincing soviet propaganda ever
05it ends liek that JarlBaconTheGreater
you know
da, komerades
FUCK YES
0,14mfw people don't know HnK
0,5:(
I'm sorry
0,5Really?
wut?
FIST OF THE GODDAMN MOTHERFUCKING NORTH STAR
CriticKitten: They're certainly going to try.
FIST OF THE GODDAMN MOTHERFUCKING NORTH STAR
if on,y I understood. Nah I'll like it anyway
I DON'T RECOGNIZE THE GODDAMN ACRONYM
anyone else want to dispose of the bourgeoise with me?
JarlBaconTheGreater: yea :(
But yeah, they would have to reboot Batman to make a JLA movie anyways.
I KNOW WHAT FotNS IS THOUGHT
You should.
I don't
0,14they are
wait, its that a song from FIW in a different language?
00,02pinkies brew in russian?
0,14iirc
I haven't even watched it and it deserves allcaps from me
never seen it referred to as HnK
Phase4 - Pinkie's Brew in Russian.
Nope, don't hear russian
The Nolan trilogy doesn't exactly lend itself to a JLA appearance.
Phase4, aye
Da, Phase4
ever
Very few things get allcaps from me
Good night, everypony.......IN SOVIET RUSSIA, 4TH WALL BREAKS YOU!
anywhere until now
Im used to the acronym HnK due to hanging around weaboos >_>
0,14actually, the way TDKR ended...
Dark92Enigma:
0,14it's POSSBILE
forget dubstep, moar Russian Pinkie's Brew! :O
/me is broken
THE FUCK IS THE COUNT TO!?
Это относится к моим интересам
still no excuse for something like this though
Anyway, otakon, I'd like to use our earlier dialogue to illustrate a fundamental difference between us.
6_9
which is?
SaxyPretender: I disagree myself. I think it won't happen in the Nolan continuity. It just doesn't work.
Your hate flows mindlessly, attacking wildly at all in its path
. . .
0,14fair enough
Hard to discuss without spoiling, damnit.
Mine is a white-hot laser that focuses on a specific task and burns it.
xD
0,14I'm guessing he may have left that as a backdoor if people want to do so
why are all my ponies hovering over my xchat?!?!
0,14but iirc, Batman franchise will be headed for a reboot
wat ees zis?
CriticKitten - i assume it's too soon to make an "Everyone dies" wisecrack?
You should learn to focus your rage and channel it.
eh I'm not that hateful. Still don't see how a fighting game can have an enjoyable and engaging 40 hour story mode.
???
saxy, like Star Trek got rebooted?
Rage, then
0,14to fit with a JLA movie
Focus your rage
0,14yeah
00,10they like to hang out near active windows ponibas
now, NEXT TOPIC!
derpy mail!
yay derpy mail
PIANO
Quit spamming allcaps and learn to focus.
I just don't think they'll want to pursue Batman in the Nolan setup. I think they'll reboot Batman entire, then if they're going JLA, then Man of Steel is probably the first in that continuity.
I dont see how a turn-based jrpg can have unboring gameplay that doesnt put me to sleep.
I am not spamming allcaps
Derpy Mail! *signs up for Derpy mail*
Your rage shall lead you do the Dark Side, yound one.
derpy is best mailpony
oh fuck

well, i have them set to \\display2... so

You'd think seeing sea ponies so much you'd get sick of it
oh...my
0,14in any case, we'd have to see how Man of Steel works out
11,01Good stream, Sumica.
SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DO
I don't know
:I
though the previews for Man of Steel have me...les than enthused.
yeess
Man, Fire Emblem
nah, i just got a kick out of it
wat ees zis?!
Yoda would say to let go of your hate and rage.....
Hates me
Shadow Hearts is a good example
i dragged xchat to main display
ITZ A HOOMAN
What I miss- oh...Sea ponys...
was wondering how long it would be before this song played again :D
We got Sea Ponied at the end of our Redline teaser!
AAAAAAAAAAAAA
0,14to quote a friend of mine
That's a STUPID thing to do.
Keel hehr!
Fire Emblem is a game of thinking ahead and luck.
Weren't we going to watch that tonight?
geez sad movies
CriticKitten: I'm fine with Dark. The issue is with them trying to make it MOODY
mostly thinking ahead
If I'm in distresss.
O_O
0,5mfw sumica's desktop pony dancing to this song
I had a new Tag for TF2
"Oh it's not bad enough you have to wade through five times the number of your units? WE'LL HAVE YOU RESCUE HOUSES THAT ARE ON FIRE WHILE YOU DO IT"
no luck too
I call gordan freemen
Fire Emblem is good for chess players like me.
not singing fucking seahorses
It was grape.
Proper planning can mitigate luck having any factor
bull
^^
THAT'S NOT APPLEJACK!
Those eyes!
0,5ET WAS GREATH
I dare Hasbro, if they don't add remake of this song in the third season, I am SO going to ragequit!
But if you have Derpy mail carry a giant iron cauldron to Zecora, she's not responsible if she drops it on a Manticore and it chases her to Ponyville and starts attacking the town
I've been hit when it shouldn't have happened
ITs Bizaro AJ
Those eyes!
Thanks for streaming, Sumica.
Lol
i love seaponies xD
Thanks for the stream, Sumica~
well we're dead
I love this song
banned!!!!
You didn't plan well then.
I've missed when I should have hit
Uh oh...
Thanks for streaming Sumica
doooommmmm
00,10almost forgot
oh no.... please no! :(
OH my
You didn't plan well then.
0,5hehe
00,02surprise jagger
CriticKitten: Smallville wasn't even moody. It was just boring pap and makeout scenes.
What is this?
Seaponies and TF2 song! :)
yay
ty Sumica! ^^
Whaaaa?
i love this song lol
take me away
isn't this that ban thing?
I've been criticaled by the single digit chances
Haters gonna Hate
bull
fuck the seeponies
0,14I liked the ending to Smallville >.>
.....indeed
This isn't my Touhou.
BANNED!
you can't plan for luck
Sumica: i just noticed i think ya finally scared off that moopy guy with your sign off :D
Buytoast: What ban thing?
You should always maneouvre in such a way that, even if you fail, then you are able to recover.
hahahha
Noooo!!!! Im Banned! :'(
0,5:D
But I'll give Man of Steel a chance I guess. I don't think they'll be able to achieve the success of Avengers though.
Life. Lesson.

i like the medic one better
this video
i dislike this song, but this video makes it worth it XD
MooOOOOooOOves like soldier
00,10dems fighten words Brother-Aura
yeah unless you don't want anyone to die
Getting banned with style.
I like the Lyra one better
Banners gonna Ban
which I never do
otakon
Mooooheeeehoooves lieek jagguh
Especially if they go with this "darker tone" crap.
hooves like jagger
so if someone dies, I restart the stage
I am currently doing a no-deaths run of Radiant Dawn
I come back to BANNED??? Rofl! :D
Dat Soldier faec
yaaaa-a-a-a-a--a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aah
They'll scare people away.
i like the medic one much better
lol
I haven't had to restart a stage yet.
CriticKitten: it all depends on how they handle it. But I have pretty much zero faith in Zack Snyder, so we'll have to see.
well that's Radiant Dawn
I have that icture
Yuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuh-doo-vaa-day-dah
picture
Is this good night and thanks for all the fish?
....
what about that moon thingy?
the point is when you take every advantage and the enemy STILL manages to not only hit you but kill your guy it's bullshit luck.
Woona Stuck
the amazing spider-man was at least decent IMO
Well then you're just one unlucky bastard. Sorry.
And the CPU hates you
exactly
CriticKitten: I wouldn't say that. I mean, TDK was probably the darkest Superhero movie I've ever seen, and it made a fuckton of money.
ask Savage about my luck
though thats marvel, not DC :P
the CPU hates everyone in fire emblem
Hey, this seems to be a pattern. Bots of all kinds hate otakon.
I hate The Amazing Spiderman without even having seen it on nerdrage principles.
Otakon one does in fact plan for luck... You plan for bad luck so you can recover from it, good luck is irrelevant cause it's in your favor
Well, good night all you comic-talking ponies.
I'm gonna become a Wrecker like in Phantasy Star 2
You just need to give it the same hate back
Night, Murky
His appearance in that movie = no Spiderman in the Avengers 2.
;_;
I for some reason want to play Batman Arkum city
Adios, Murky!
Amazing Spider-man is almost guaranteed to piss me off, as the previews have made it look like they turned Peter Parker into a douchebag
what movie did you guys watch
is the stream done for good?
maybe
maybe not
thanks again Sumica
The CPU on your side in Fire Emblem hates you too
but yeah
Lol :P
The allied CPUS always, ALWAYS do stupid things
I think steam is done unless another mod takes its place
Dear god sea ponies is still in my head :[
RAWRity: True, but that's partially due to the hype behind it. Dark Knight got a boost from Ledger's death too.
Ask RX about my luck with packs in ME3
CriticKitten: it wasn't gonna happen anyway
Thanks Sumica!
opinions are opinions ^^
I havent been in here all day... busy day today o_o
I mean Stream not Steam *facehoof*
/me presents otakon with 3 boxes. open one. A, B, or C
RAWRity: Don't say such things. I have dreams too. ;_;
Celestia's tiara is buffering! :)
SPider-man's owned by Sony. Avengers is Disney.
You get plenty of rares and ultra rares, just not the very specific ones you want.
RARity in the comics hes a wisecracker anyway. Hes also semi arrogant and cocky
I've only had 5 hours of sleep :D
no characters
thats spidermans charm ;p
and X-men is, sadly, owned by Fox
oops meant 3
not a single goddamn one
for a week
/me I pick Box B!
"Let's send the archer out after the Laguz unit, and leave it there!" "Let's attack this guy while shifted and, when unshifted, run into a nearvy corner!" "LET'S HEAL THE TANK WHILE THE GLASS CANNON IS NEARLY DEAD"
and the chances of them are equal to getting any other rare
RAWRity: Technically if the new film hadn't come out, Sony would likely have lost the rights well before Avengers 2.
but it's the POOL it's drawing from RX
VenHur96 is not otakon
i havent seen the dark knight rises yet though :P
the rare pool for me is small
right, well because i can, i'm going to go watch Bronies React (Finale) for about the... 15th time?
just because.
and yet still no characters
Oh...my bad.
So stream over?
At least once, I told all my allied units to huddle in the back while my controlled units wrecked everything.
thats okay... otakon is not VenHur96
They've already lost a lot of merchandising rights to Spiderman.
0,5lol
Malmortius: I know that Peter's the type to make quips and stuff during a fight. He's NOT the type of guy who webs somebody to the wall after beating them, and then hits them in the nuts to mock them.
0,5MirrorImage i love that video
0,5Especially when celestia gets KO'ed
i got up at 5:30 am, went to bed at 3 am, midnight right now. Gotta make those Medtronic cables! :$
well im off to read FOE, cya later
but yeah
considering how many rare gear they added the pools is still pretty large
So i guess stream is over then
i feel like it should be the video i would sho to someone to convince them to become a brony...
though it's more likely to backfire...
TO THE PLAYER MANIFEST!
the pool also has aids, but thats old.
Night, Darf14
Old meme is so old it's already rotting in the grave.
Its not like it was hurting him that much RAWRity. I think ASMs spiderman is close than tobys, even though i loved toby as spiderman
Oh, and CriticKitten? They're making another Fantastic Four movie.
00,10SuperBrony64, ping
Death: cancer.
is the stream over?
yes
sumica, yay
RAWRity: That's my issue with the old Burton Batmans, incidentally. People always eat those up but they're just....wrong. Batman doesn't take pleasure in murdering henchmen straight up
Well night then
Is SuperBrony64 really going to stream now.....?
I have to go to bed.... :'(
OH GOD. That's terrible news.
I thought otakon's mention of Phantasy star 2 needed something equally as ancient to keep it company.
11,02Setting up :)
CriticKitten: what's worse? It involves THE SKRULL
Ugh, is streaming over or not?!?!?!
Good Nigth rave pony
Marvel should never have given Sony the rights to their people.
which is why they had to be called "The Chitari" in Avengers
so apparently Vic Mignogna is a brony now...
Oh yeah, my favorite streamer is on!
/me hugs SuperBrony64 and gives him a filly Twilight with books
INB4 Wii Shop :)
I have ONE Gold weapon left to get
CriticKitten: to be fair, Fantastic Four is Fox
along with X-men
the Pirahna so I'll get that tomorrow for sure
and how many gear?
Spectrum_Rush|Tired - ...not sure if okay with that.
mjst play....Ponymon
That's even worse.
>_>
must
This is why I can't get ME3. Too much to do post-story. As soon as I finish the story mode, that's it, done, moving on.
/me hugs SuperBrony64 and gives him a filly Fluttershy with the "d'aaaw" look on her face.
Is ponymon updated?
So it does create problems with an Avengers 2 roster. Who do you use now? >_>
7 Gold Mods
altogether
By the way otakon, have you tried Final Fantasy 5 yet?
this is multiplayer, almost nothign to do with the story
ofc
love that game
Beat it?
enope
Ahaha
Ohai SuperBrony64 :>
not yet
Why?
Alrighty, bed time.
Which version?
X-Men characters like QuickSilver and Scarlet Witch would be out of bounds. Spider-Man is now freshly rebooted and likely not swinging over.
CriticKitten: I guess the same as before, and just hope they can get RDJ to agree to play Tony again?
Night everypony, have a good one.
and otakon, you got 2 of the new characters. you act like you have none.
/me hugs everypony back :3
Can anypony tell me is theres going to be a stream or not!?
RX-78-LazyBot: But then what would he have left to whine about?
30 total character cards
00,10yes Eulshy
RAWRity: Just the original cast? Against Thanos?
00,10that part where SuperBrony64 said seting up
Geth on silver+, but they are bullshit to fight currently
but anyway
CriticKitten: meh, just throw Hulk at him for a while. It'll clean itself up eventually.
The dude better known as a guy who killed nearly half the Marvel universe's roster singlehandedly? XD
none of my gear is level 5
none of it
and his rage whenever he gets hit by a sync kill is magical.
Though, they will potentially gain Ant-Man.
0,14well, seeing as there's going to be a Guardians of the Galaxy movie...
bc half the time I'm over 50 feet from what just grabbed me behind cover with a wall inbetween and a 20 second time gap
so that leaves every gold gear open for you to get still in a rare slot
CriticKitten: well, they're talking about bringing in Winter Soldier for Cap 2, so maybe he can act as a meat shield
Magical? Do the screams bring forth beings from the Rage Dimension?
That movie's apparently moving forward now. And Ant-Man popping up opens the door for Wasp, too.
00,03Alright gents, I'm sorry I wasn't here for long, and I won't see you guys again until Sunday. Until then, behave yourselves~
I wish they did
00,03Night y'all!
but you know thats what happens, its not a surprise anymore
cya Scoot-Scootaloo nite
Take care, Scoot-Scootaloo
you know RX, you should record one of our sessions once
0,14later Scoot-Scootaloo
CriticKitten: Ant-man's being done by the director of Hot Fuzz IIRC, right?
night Scoot-Scootaloo! ^^
I have nothing to record with >____>
dammit
0,14yep, RAWRity
It's also possible War Machine could come back, maybe take up RDJ's mantle of Iron Man...but he won't be as good.
tired
too bad Unfound doesn't want to play anymore
Welp, 6AM seems as a good a time to go to bed as any. Night folks.
he probably has a capture card
CriticKitten: Well hey, with Antman, I'm sure they can handle things!
Man, someday I have to find something to play with otakon so I can watch him rage.
nite Meanwhile
I can't imagine RDJ turning down more Iron Man roles though, I mean, he's made shitloads of money.
Night, Meanwhile
he has to up his nerd cred by being full PC m4573r r43c
He can just get drunk and slap Thanos like he's his wife...
xD
/me gives Meanwhile a filly Pinkie. TAKE THIS
xD
CriticKitten: might be tired of the character
because you cant possibly enjoy playing games one pc and consoles.....
But the character is basically RDJ as himself
on*
<_<
CriticKitten: it can be tiring being yourself all the time.
And I thought I went to bed late.
That's what amkes him o awesome
okay
OKAY
I have 92 total Gold items left to unlock
brb
Does anyone have Alien Swarm? Because my friend I play with is away, and it is not a game to be played solo.
that is ofc if everything is maxed out
if just to get access to it, the number is MUCH lower
I have it, but I am busy torrenting shit
Avengers 2 opens up with Tony Stark's funeral after he took the Mark 8 Armor out for a spin with a BAL of .15
and tired >_>
i would play but i have to reinstall everything in my laptop
Same here
I was just wondering who to bug some tomorrow.
I actually only have 8 things left to unlock
f
I need one class and one gun, a a bunch of gear
Yuck. xD
I actually only have 8 things left to unlock Rare wise but the game REFUSES to unlock them.
I refuse to play ME3 until everyone stops whining about it.
...
i'm boooooooored i want to play something....
Reikim: well you'll be in for a wait
ooh! I know!
I think the film needs him to be truly successful. Part of the reason the Avengers rocked was that he played well with the other characters.
Reikim: the Nerf Wars, they are coming
They are here otakon
Bleh
They are already here.
back
They're gonna have a hard time matching that charisma on-screen.
now everyone is complaining about the awesome full auto shotgun we just got
have you seen the front page of BSN multiplayer forums?
Bring in Red Hulk and Grey Hulk in the next Hulk movie, and they can be in Avengers 2 as well
saying it's overpowered
it's fine for what it's supposed to be
odooddoododododododoododooddododo
its too light >_>
full auto shotgun great at very close range
TBH, I found a lot of Tony's lines in Avengers to be rather forced.
it's not that light
I don't know why you'd complain about the ability to rampage with a full-auto shotgun.
170% at level X
bc it makes the game too easy apparently
Like a lot of Whedon's "clever" writing, actually
and the Eviscerator is lighter
and the Disciple is lighter
bored, hungry
"Eviscerator"
Mhm..
and the Katana is the same but has better range
need food
I wouldn't know
A gun named after one of my favourite words
making it heavier would help to keep all weapons viable, instead of having all caster classes take the pihranna
I'd disagree. I thought the character banter was some of the best stuff in the film.
Hello OtakuTom and cratorkid~
do you want them to pull a Krysae on it?
ive never read the comic, so i wouldnt know the difference
It made the whole thing crazy fun.
no
I just want it heavier
srry
That gun has been nerfed to hell
FlareChaser: i was here already , just refreshed
Hi everypony
it's useless now
so that it doesnt get krysae'D
not completely
Ah, okay :P
Hi OtakuTom ^^
if they gave it back its old RoF itd be fine
The right-hand-side is story of my life
Eh, it just seems whenever Whedon's trying to write banter, I can always tell the jokes before they come. I can tell when one character's setting up another one for a one-liner, or a speech.
I'm excited, I just got my new laptop (old laptop started to die on me sooner than expected)
even put on a class that boosts weapon damage as much as possible it can't kill a Brute with all of it's shots.
It all just feels like he's TRYING to emulate the banter in other comedic movies, but isn't as good or natural at it.
I caught the cutie mark crusaders in ponymon :3
they could even lower the damage some more if it got its old RoF back
No stream?
it can kill one in about two clips
okay Reikim
that made me laugh
so long as it doesnt fire duds
I vote that Alucard is best pony that has nothing to do with mlp. he even has a cutie mark. who is with me?
...
RX-78-LazyBot: I JUST tested it remember?
<_<
>_>
<_<
Krysae X, on Silver
which happens if you hit them directly when not host
>_>
aluvard?
Man, I wish I could be brave enough to walk into McD's and order a pony.
<_<
alucard?
Dov - I vote for Mr. Ed.
Reikim: just do it
at least he could speak
I tested it recently too, and with only a krysae 8
Alpha-Omega: Le gasp!
RAWRity: Eh I disagree. I think it really works in a lot of cases.
And then kickscript.
MirrorImage: fair enough
Needs more stream
well I could try it with my Weapons Soldier
ehh I've had worse results
it needs either a turian soldier, destroyer, or geth
but still, a 40% damage boost and ALL my ammo later and the Brute was still alive with 3 bars of armor
um no
My cat... hates me... :'( she sometimes goes nuts... She has done this periodically for 2 years after surgery. Last time was over 1.5 years ago. She acts almost feral. I can't even open her Space to get to her water bowl. vet gave phereones, did not help. Advice??? Anyone experience similar. Normally, she is loving and nice, but she can flip in seconds. I've been bloodied by her before.
because it was firing duds
WeLoveFine is now selling pony iPod shtuff
Turian Soldier only gets 35% weapon boost
All the same, I just....don't see how the JLA movie can come together, realistically.
at best
lag effects all the AoE guns alot
Marksmen needs a buff
richfiles - sounds like "that time of the month"
he gets a RoF boost
All this ME3 nerding
reikim just order a kid meal and a burger to go
spayed
to put it another way: it's like when a friend has a joke the want to tell, but they ant to make it sound natural, so they say weirdly specific things trying to get you to set them up.
it either needs to refill ammo
that is the importantce here
It feels like Whedon's always having his characters do that.
or make it so you don't have to reload for the duration
THAT'S IT!
turian soldier does need a buff
I'm allergic so I wouldn't know much about cats
you don't need to reload during the duration of Marksman
turians need to be able to dodge for one
first happened after she injured her insision 2 days after surgury. I couldn't work for a week after what she did to my hand.
just increase the cooldown for balance
that would help give him a role separate from the destroyer
TIARAWHY AND SLUGBOX ARE THE BEST PONY ARTISTS!
happened several times, she eventually was confined to a cat run I built for her.
oh gosh nooo
window boxes, long spaces, ramps, etc.
eeyup
he needs a dodge
she was good for a year and a half.
Reikim: you links just give me a page with a bunch of them
CriticKitten: Well, we got a Green Lantern movie, and it's getting a sequel
Waht
up up down down left right left right b a select start
Reikim: funny
Most likely solo movies, so that's Wonder Woman, Flash, and a Martian Manhunter movie. Plus a new Green Lantern because that one was SCREWED
probably just me though
probably
CriticKitten: Um... one problem with that is... the Green Lantern Movie. HORRIBLE.
Yup just you
all the 4 chan you had earlier was 403 for me
The Green Lanturn movie was bad, and i felt bad watching it
RAWRity: That's part of the problem.
Number 17 for reference
same way my compy hates non-direct image links to imgur
So, if you were a pony in Equestria, which of the mane 6 would you sleep with?
Looks like RX has some weird Internet stuff goin' on
rarity
If they stick with the existing continuity on Green Lantern then they may as well throw in the towel on JLA right now.
I feel like this is an abondon chat moment for me
If it's been 1.5 years since the last episode, maybe she's calmed down.
nah, just the quirks of my computer
I was cleaning her litter and giving her fresh food and water. stubbed my toe and droped the 2 Liter. she was at the other end. She ent nuts after that, but has not settled for over 27 hours.
People will not want to see that guy don the ring again.
Eddmario: seeing as ponies don't have genetalia, we're talking strictly sharing a bed on like a sleep-over thing, right?
13mfw there's like five votes for twister this week
sure....
HA
neat
Oh, so this is the first incident in 1.5 years.
happy tree friends
but that's a B
RAWRity: <_< >_> <_< >_> ...no?
eddmario... totally :$
mina hates imgur albums i can't view them cause they never change pic
13it's A
A my ass
13it was a big deal in 1997
1396
13whenever
Wait, sequel?
well okay I'll give you that
13it's also the first DVD iirc
/me looks
Eulshy: I'm more of a Twiligh Sparkle kindof guy
Twister?
13besides we aired as A
It got a ton of promotion when it came out
yeah Twister
*Twilight
I say Rarity, Twilight, Pinkie, Applejack or Fluttershy
Eddmario: then what's the point? then it just grinding one featureless, baren pelvis against another featureless, baren pelvis
Just not Rainbow Dash
....
why not Rainbow?
it's like, Dry humping taken to the next level
We need the mods to get together and play twister.
RAWRity, taking our fun away
RAWRity: *faceaplm* You know what I mean...
13i played it once
13late night
RAWRity: Green Lantern 2 hasn't been greenlit yet according to IMDb....
not the movie
Shizuka: damn didn't take you too long to play Meanwhile at FS did it?
If you haven't seen any of her work, google "TiaraWhy"
Why are we talking about Twister
yea no
13it is easy
I honestly thought she was fine adn had been considering leaving teh run open for her... but with today... She growls, hisses, spits, scratches and attempts to bite. She IS calm enough that If I approach her with wet fode, I can spoon feed her, and even scratch her head and ears and such, but the second I stop feeding, she will try attacking again.
13to set up anyway, the game itself is chess level hard
bc
richfiles: We get it, your girlfriend is a bitch...
No I have seen tairawhy's stuff and it's a thread I will leave abondoned
it might get picked
for A
Eddmario lol
13correction there are four votes for twister as A
I was talking about ths twister: http://salvadorcolom.com/images/4645.jpg
13i think i might make myself the fifth... and core for B
8,6I suggest changing the topic of conversation, and Eddmario, you know better than to try shit like that
13wtf stargate is not a B...
WHY!?
...Chess is not hard.
chess is as hard as the opponent
Reikim: it's all about thinking ahead of your opponent
Exactly
._.
hell we should play a game online then
Yes
Just trying to get everyone onto a single topic krizstryfe, especially cause it seems everyone's ignoring eachother...
Yes I will do this
richfiles, do you have experience approaching feral cats?
wonder where we can set that up
But first, what timezone are you in?
Oh god what has this place become ;~;
eST
This is what the Queen was thinking throughout the OC today: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7upn3yQvs1r55dpso1_500.jpg
and otakon will be rock hard :P
it's 1 am here
13FS plays by email
Topic must change
FlareChaser - BronyState PrimeTime?
oh not email...
Great, that means you don't get a sleep advantage
Getting back on topic, who is best pony?
8,6good for you, keep it SFW or take it to another channel
13it's synchronous turns but fully asynchronous input
So, let's try and assume a perfect world here, pretending the studio has enough sense not to tie the existing Green Lantern into a future JLA.
oh
OH
13so you take your turn and it alerts the other guy
I know at least one site
NEW TOPIC:
13or if you're both on it just goes
Derpy.
who's excited for the deadpool game?
oh no comic nook talk....
ME! :D
book
Search Fairy Tale with Flat Fact.
/me chokes back laughter at RAWRity's image macro
That means the JLA continuity opens with Man of Steel, probably continues with either a Batman movie or a new Green Lantern/Flash....
RAWRity: you're gonna maek me die of laughter
I'm too curios for my own good
Ive been gone all day... and am now lost on these conversations :(
curious
Sec otakon...I'll trash you in chess before I go to sleep.
so it's just me and FlareChaser who is excited for the deadpool game coming out?
Bed time for me....good night everypony!!
RaveBrony, I dunno.
It's a weird day when this was something you watched on TV, and it's NOT the strangest thing you've seen that day: https://p.twimg.com/Ay3MdhmCMAArKLg.jpg
not tonight
Bah
Derpy_Hooves, Yup, damn.
But then you STILL need Wonder Woman, and you need to introduce Martian Manhunter somehow.
getting near my cutoff time
Tomorrow then
Take care and have fun :)
sounds good
IMO they need to hurry up and make a deadpool movie :I
Wait
No
https://secure.chess.com/register.html
I have an account there
So, a family walks into a talent agency...
t
Alright im tired and hungry so ima not wait here and get food
but
Derpy_Hooves: Consider the previous incarnation of Deadpool. Reconsider that desire of yours.
Nyx: Oh god, not that joke..
Heh, I got otakon kicked
do you have an account?
Heh, I got otakon-kicked
Reikim: You took him to Hawaii?
Anyway, make an account on https://secure.chess.com/register.html
OTAKICK'D
RAWRity: da fuq
And we'll settle this come tomorrow
CriticKitten enlighten me
I'm going to be moving to an apartment next month... I really don't think I can take her there with that type of unexpected behavior. It would be horrible if she ever got out nd hurt another person. She almost blinded my mother once. bit half an inch from her eye while she slept. She was at my place when she had her first episode, but has her own apartment now. Also, :) is best mane 6
About the only thing it got right is that it closed Ryan Reynolds' dumb mouth.
Eddmario: I mean, I got kicked the way he does.
eeyup
otakon28
Done
ottercan34
apparently the vanilla otakon was taken
Reikim: When I typed that, your thing said "laid" instead of "kicked"
anything on?
:3
CriticKitten: Let's be fair here. Reynolds got like, 5 minutes as Deadpool before he became Barakapool
Derpy_Hooves: Never saw "X-Men Origins: Wolverine"?
Waffles: Just a blue you
....I don't think of a best pony I just have a favorite
CriticKitten nope :3
/me 11,01dusts Reikim with a raincloud.
13fun fact, meanwhile was the first person to vote this week
Derpy_Hooves: Well that would be the Deadpool they intend to base a future movie on.
/me is now wet
raincloud is best hero
In Equestria, is it called "Choking the Scootaloo"?
Achoo. Thanks, Nitt, now I've got a cold...
CriticKitten why is that?
So I suggest you go watch it and then cry yourself to sleep in the knowledge that it's going to be awful.
Quick on the gun, isn't he
11,01Aww :< Sorry :<
how was the olympics?
oh buck why:S
Eddmario: Dude....
I would guess he is likey one of the first few everyweek
0,14CriticKitten, YOU :IE
Nitt, Why would you do that? @_@
0,14*LIE
likely*
Derpy_Hooves: Because they've pretty much stated they intend to implement him the exact same way.
Woops, that was meant to be a PM to Nyx
every week*
Dat Ghosties :3
Vanilla Reikim is now mine.
CriticKitten: actually, they announced a Deadpool movie back in 2010, and said they'd be ignoring Origins altogether.
wait
They even got Ryan Reynolds to agree to reprise the role.
0,14^
Don't know if that's still true, but still.
11,01I didn't mean to.
didn't he also volunteer for a new signup too?
no ChocolateReikim?
0,14Ryan Reynolds wants it to be a musical
0,14I'm okay with that
04I was gonna just sign out until Flare said something >_>
New signup?
CriticKitten: what im asking why were they trying give him that personality and what was the previous deadpool like?
for the bronystate newletter
oh hai Ghosties
Ghosties: So, do we giggle at you or what?
04NO
04NO GIGGLING
04EVER
some stay dry others feel the paikim
>_>
04:I
we all hug Ghosties
<_<
:D
0,14You hug him inste-
0,14....
/me giggles as Ghosties
Derpy_Hooves: It's impossible to describe how bad it was.
0,14damn you, RAWRity
/me giggle at the Ghosties anyways :I
04STOP THAT! STOP THAT RIGHT NAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ghosties: thinking you can just dissapear like a.. aghost or something
What
/me gargles at Ghosties
Derpy_Hooves: Just go watch the movie and you'll see.
I don't get it
03 Take that, you Ghost
:S is confused
04Eww, don't gargle at me ><
Neither do I.....
...
0,14also, CriticKitten, to be fair, the "Wade WIlson" part was good
....
/me glimmers at the Ghosties
argh
gargle blaster!?!
0,14everything after that sucked
:3
CriticKitten: wait does deadpool do any head decapitations?
/me is hurt by the level of stupid that was.
So many mods, and yet not one is willing to stream?
it was over 9000
Um.
No.
Ghosties: What do we do at you then? Just admire your presence?
He gets his own head chopped off. And sword-shaped bones coming out of his arms like Baraka.
glitters at the Ghosties
It was a terrible TERRIBLE joke
NO
/me 11,01dusts the Ghosties with laughter
but stupid it was not.
Eddmario: I know, right? They could at least get off their lazy flank and come up with SOMETHING
You know, JUST LIKE THE REAL DEADPOOL LOL
I cna't find otakon on Chess.com
13Hi ponies
0,14>lazy
13Just want to let you know
0,14...
otakon28
search for ottercan
13If any of you have not voted in this week's lottery
otakon28
or oat-kun
13Do it now
NOT oat-kun
13I will be closing at the bottom of the hour
13GO GO GO
CriticKitten: does he at leasty live through the head decapitation? :I
I did it on Monday. :3 But thanks.
why so soon'
Did you validate your account?
or onomotokonapedia
oh crap
Nope, he dies.
33 Minutes remaining.
Resevoir Dogs goes to my vote
that's what I haven't done yet
CriticKitten: no, her survives
Just make the movie about Pinkie Pie. The 4th wall doesn't stand a chance. Eventually Deadpool will appear by default! :O
0,14^
CriticKitten: RETARDED >:I
Yeah
13We intend to start closing on Thursdays, this gives us time to go through entries and debate them without chewing up intermission time
have no idea how to vote
Wat.
0,14there's a couple of endings for that movie
Did he move after the credits or some shit?
or gomennassaiwhiteknightofrage28
>_>
CriticKitten thats stupid, why does he die?
Go do that so I can friend you so you're an easier targe- I mean so we can play easier.
0,14yep, CriticKitten
A/B/Whatever Movie it'd be: Resevoir Dogs. Episode: Luna Eclipsed
deadpool cant die D:
0,14he does
after the credits, it shows him in the rubble, and the eyes open up and the body picks up the head and does the "shhhh
Figures.
" thing
:D RX
>_>
What a load of horse crap.
I think I'll stop now
there we go
:$ I thought I flushed that???
all doen
Hate when plot-relevant info is shoved into an after-credits teaser. >_>
wait....
CriticKitten: but like I said, when they announced the Deadpool movie, they said they were completely ignoring Origins
DOEN
gomennassiawhiteknighofrage?
DOEN'S ISLAND
Is the Hulk movie with Edward Norton supposed to be a sequal to Ang Lee's terrible version?
RX
:3
GET SOME SLEEP
Eddmario: no
reboot
why am I so confused
RAWRity: But they also said they wanted a sequel to that movie.
13Last warning, if you haven't voted in this week's lottery, you have a minute
04<XAX> Ghosties: What do we do at you then? Just admire your presence? <-- just eat some spicy brown mustard or something, I dunno
I want to
So wat the hell.
But I cant *_*
don't like mustard
Shizuka: So, how DO we vote?
04<richfiles> glitters at the Ghosties <-- All that glitters...
:|
er... where do you vote on the lottery? o.o"
wait... so first bottom of the hour, and now 1 minute shizuka?
what happened to the other 30 minutes?
13bottom of the hour == :30
CriticKitten: Origins' "sequel" eventually became X-men First Class
Shizuka: I don't seem to have recieved the survey e-mail?
13it is 12:29
11,01Ghosties: is so sparkly.
04* @Nittany_Discord dusts the Ghosties with laughter <-- ...how do you dust someone with laughter? :|c
I'm just gonna say when you enter "Your a silly Ghosty"
Shizuka: Um, we've got 6 minutes then...
Annnnnnnnd, Time's Up!
11,01With skill.
RAWRity: You sure? I seem to recall them saying they still wanted another Wolverine movie.
/me voted in the lottery Monday
Ghosties: you dust them WHILE laughing
you're
Im probably gonna end up watching more random anime on youtube and netflix til like 6am
11,01And what otakon said.
04I guess that works
Graghagh I haven't recieved survery mail so I can't vote
dammit
Me and Nyx both voted for Resevoir Dogs
how do you vote on the lottery?
In fact I think the villain of that movie was revealed at last year's SDCC.
that sucks
>Graghagh
Soul, you need to sign up for the newsletter.
CriticKitten: First Class more or less was them dumping several different ideas and just going with a prequel.
but anyway I think I'm out for now
11,01Shizuka: That's bottom of this half-hour.
Reikim is some kind of goblin-troll
oh ok
don't want to get yelled at for being on the PC too late
13top of the hour is :00... bottom is :30... i thought everypony knew that...
Ah, found my confirmation.
Better than a french dwarf on fire
Ghosties: question, if you're a ghost why do you look like a mummy?
Thats debatable
see you all tomorrow and I AM NOT FRENCH!
> still can't find otakon
04It's a reference
otakon28
Dwarves can be pretty badass.
Yeah, last year at SDCC, Hugh Jackman was naming the film's villain.
^She's pregnant?
i understood those expressions Shizuka as both referring to :00
What happened to the picture square?
So apparently there WILL be a Wolverine movie.
oat-kun69
13anyway closed now, we have 147 entries this week
okay guys
Anypony getting the Hardcover printed Fallout: Equestri or Past Sins books? :)
Oh hai Guys
I'm out for now
or at the very least, not :30
take care
CriticKitten: There already was...
I'll try that one
no
XD
not oat-kun
Though it's not clear if it's going to be a sequel or a reboot or what, apparently. It's called "The Wolverine".
04Besides, some interpretations of ghosts in media has them in chains and junk
ottercan34
actually, befoer you the only one that came up with oat kun was Shizu
MFW this is on my facebook - YOU PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANNOYED I AM BY THE LACK OF DAVID TENNANT
Totally agree
Just to make clear, I didn't say it, someone else did
:P
ota-kun
*oat-kun
CriticKitten: just looked it up. Wiki says it's a sequel, but it's been delayed since Jackman was doing Les Miserables
What about David?
I like messing with words and names....
sureee install norton >.>
Perfect, seeing as we've got so many ponies in here
If only I knew who that was
That's someone's response to him not being in the opening cermony.
:P
But if it's a sequel....
So, what's the difference between the mods with highlights and the ones with colored text?
....
Hey, you guys got your Doctor shoutout. Deal with it.
oat-kun is now designated food source
Eddmario - no difference
That means they're playing in THREE different continuities.
I switch the vowels around a bunch and then delve off into whatever sounds pop up
D:< HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE???!?
Eddmario: nothing
night guys
Lol, Doctor wasn't there
they just choose their own color scheme to identify themselves
CriticKitten: I don't think Fox gives a fuck about Continuities atm.
Night. I'll be leaving too, so night
Ish has been nomming on oat-kun for a while then
JarlBaconTheGreater, for instance, has a color scheme distinctly reminiscent of Bacon...
Well, I'm gonna go kill of a generation while looking at NC-17 MLP art..
Good night Otakon
Night everyone. Time to fall asleep again...
night otakon
Night, otakon
a fact i think i pointed out the first time...
Night, Reikim
8,6I'd like to let everyone know that I'm aware that Eddmario and Nyx are the same person, and to say goodbye because he won't be around for much longer
CriticKitten: maybe they'll just say "Oh, this is the story of Ultimate Wolverine"
bye peoples.
First Class is a separate continuity, Origins/Wolverine 2 is another, and then a hypothetical Deadpool movie would be separate too
oh dammit I forget kirzstryfe
mfw i realized i slept threw the opening ceremony http://i.imgur.com/pB3Bn.gif
Oh crap.
Fox needs to stop failing, right now.
CriticKitten: not gonna happen. And I hear they're making another Narnia movie
Well i got a popsicle
AW YEAH, KIRZ BEING A HERO
Well I don't know what to say to that
Their movies are getting as stupidly convoluted as the comics.
We need a deadpool Movie
Now ima watch Dragon ball z abridged
RAWRity: But....
Bye ponies
bye
Bye
I am the amazing Epalant
CriticKitten: people can think of it as a test. If you can keep up with the clusterfuck of different universes, you can likely handle the constant reboots and retcons in the Big 2 comics!
Lol Epalant
I'm gonna play ponymon but I'll still be here
Pass. I'd rather have them make sense myself.
Ok
Delicious Clusterfucks.
night reikim
:O
haha The Epalant is here Supersaga
and then everyone leave
reikim left before ottercan
That's why I like the Avengers setup. It's all surprisingly straightforward.
Lol
04Oh, goodnight ota
No multiple continuities to muddle through. >_>
XD
ehh can't blame me i'm on a phone can't se everything
oh tay kahn?
:|
Never blamed you for anything
ota reminds me of the Overwatch trans-human arm
just saiyin :3
CriticKitten: it was also, y'know, planned. Fox is more "We have the license? make an action movie and get us money."
Supersaga ppl be hatin on your reddit XD
Man, the Closing Ceremonies should just be David Tennant putting out the Olympic Torch, using the Red Dwarf. How overkill can you get than Colony-Dropping a city-sized spacecraft on London?
if anything we blme sxyrtendr
Lol Epalant Ikr
otakon sure knows how to make an exit
Hell, for whatever reasone they've decided the next Narnia movie to do should be The Magicians Nephew
yeah now you only get 1 karma from it
Nah, I blame insomnia.
im gonna go might be back later, bye
then Sxyprtndr
Then viewers like you.
i'm so bored i been fixing this laptop all freacking day

still, you know what really deserves a movie?
not sure if I want to be referncing Forrest or Lola here....
"Spider-man: Turn Off The Dark"
aka the most expensive Broadway Musical in history
why no both ?
Because thats crossing the streams :3
>_>
I need sleep
ikr
yay ie you did your job downloading mozilla
/me starts cleaning up Nittany_Discord
like im actually doing shit tomorro
now rest in peace
IE MISSION COMPRETE
apple bloom leveled up
Oh my :O
What did I just sign in to? :S
but she'll still never get her Cutie Mark
thats all IE is good for
is there a stream on?
So, had a discussion with a Brony on FB today.
Failure is the only option
allowing you to download a different browser
And during it, I came to the conclusion that Luna is a terrible ruler.
I keep it around for the occasional page firefox hates
8,6SB's trying to set up for minecraft, but is having issues
Icaugh zecora :3
like, really pretty shit at her job.
use chrome for tha
It's pretty much dramatic irony; we already know the CMC's special talents but they don't.
*that
I refuse to support the evil google empire.
^dis
Frick i got popcorn and butter for nothing, Nothing is on air.
Well she is 1000 years out of date...
the crhome one no ie
And apparently also still a kid by alicorn standards
I happen to be playing Minecraft myself. Making a dungeon right now.
hen3ry: and she also did NOTHING to help when Chrysalis or Discord attacked
They forgot to follow their own slogan of do no evil
Yeah
She is from a race of trolls...
What can you expect?
she was just like: Get elements of haromy and do my work cuz im just TO FUCKING lazy to get off my ass to do it
I still prefer Luna over Celestia
Me too
all the while, people give Celestia shit for not sending Twilight enough tickets. At least SHE fucking does stuff when there's a disruption in Equestria, even if it's just to send Twilight to handle it.
She is not the ruler they need. She is the ruler they deserve
Discord should be luna's husband and they MAKE A FILLY/FOAL :#
:(
What's all the butthurt about now?
Dirty mind i had.
GOOD JOB LUNA
I hope i didnt miss pony videos.
6_9 Did i?
Celesta is just a troll with 1000 extra years of maturity. So she has learned when not to troll. Finally
Your argument is invalid I'm playing Ponymon
Celesta is an instrument.
Luna isn't trolling, she's just incompetent
/me hugs Phase4

Celestia: GO GET THE FUCKING ELEMENTS CUZ IM TO FUCKING LAZY TO DO IT

I've always preferred Celestia over Luna :P
Did I miss Nadia: Blue Waterwhatever?!

11,02OHAI :D

Discord is set loose? She immediately sends for Twilight so they can use the Elements of Harmony. Chrysalis attacks? Celestia says this aggression will not fucking stand.
SuperBrony64: *raises hand*

Did you say minecraft??
11,02Okie XAX, gimme min :3

What did Luna do? two things: Jack, and shit.
OK i'm in
Jack is a lucky colt
Superbrony64: I have a minute =Raises hand- My skin is a rainbowdash skin
anything on.
name : Moomoo1254 inspired by: Moomoo Milk
whaaaa how did i change the style of firefox i forgot
:S
silence...
So I saw the stream about six and a half hours ago and it seemed to me that BMN was interrupted by the Olympics :P
SuperBrony64: I would but I literally started MC two days ago
Sorry my internet stopped.
Luna was probably busy makings sure Equestria was safe abroad, while Celestia watched the capitol during the day... And sleeping. Also sleeping! :$
well..that's unfortunate: http://thisisphotobomb.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/photobomb-that-guy-how-brave.jpg
SuperBrony64: Ill play mc, my name is Moomoo1254, it was inspired by: Moomoo Milk
Cadence is allowed to force ponies to be in love. At least Luna is harmless
Oh geeze
hen3ry: if by harmless you mean horrible incompetent to the point that Cadance and Shining Armor had to fight Chrysalis while she was off napping.
SuperBrony64: Do you got a mc server?
00,02http://derpy.me/-OXMq
Luna/Blueblood 2012 - at least they won't make things worse by acting
So Cadance's spell implants love into pony's hearts? :P
I disagree.
:[
Instead they will make things worse by NOT acting.
Well politicians only have two ways to buck up
Who has mc and has a server for fellow bronies
Do nothing, or do wrong thing
what we watching?
Nuffin
I'm gonna crash for the night... My cat, after 28 hours, finally let me finish giving her fresh water adn food. I can see her eyes are still dialated, but she let me close enough to offer the items, and actually meowed a "want it" meow, vs her DEATH TO ALL THINGS sounds. :(
its just a buffer <.<
11,02Refresh embed :)
the buffer got BIIG!
SuperBrony64: Do you have a minecraft server?
so tired but i must stay up besides sleeping is overated anyway
SuperBrony64, I can join.
i have my mc up
11,02For now, the server is open to those who are playing the game :3
any pony servers?
I am, Whats the ip
i'm up to
SuperBrony64: I am, What is th eip
00,02SuperBrony64, what if we just lost the game?
11,02:O

11,02I can take two other players to play...
00,02i call dibs
plz me?
Me! -Raises hand-
I don't know what the server address is though.

00,02RAWRity, XD
i have a server i go to all the time
want teh ip?
URGGGGGGGGGGH
How do i pm someone
Cadance's Love spell, as I see it, doesn't implant love in people's hearts; rather, the love is already there but hidden by impatience or anger or whatever. The spell brings that love between ponies to the forefront.
Also, dat text wall :P
/me needs to finish building her house.
if anyone else wants to play mc i'm game
/me hugs SuperBrony64 "I liek sea ponies"
good morning everypony
Who has a mc server for 10 people, if so i call DIBS ON COMING IN IT
So when will the video square be up?

Wgho has a mc server (Correct my mistakes ol)
it never ends
it only consumes
I'm going to be away for tomorrow night.
You defeat discord/dragon and get a egg
Raynbohdas: It never ends, even when you kill the ender dragon
The only thing that's close that EA is making another massive multiplayer Sims game is MySims
I'm playing Ponymon and I picked filly rainbow dash as my starter :3
Also, Simcity 2013 :P

so i have no idea
^
alexxm: it's a nice RPG but I hated really bad the story
ok thanks MadSurge
alexxm: try Earthbound instead :D
ah well, back to my dirt house in mindcraft
The one challenge a game creator has to succeed, creating a decent story/plot.
Jmo4267 incorrect
whys it asking so many questions about you
being a fun game is the only thing a game needs to be
everything else is just gravy
well, it also needs to be interactive
or its just a bad movie
alexxm: it reflects on the game's dialogue
O__o
So you'd play a fun game even if it was glitchy and had a bad plot?
yes
Magicka is popping to my mind.
i generally dont care about the plot
magicka was amazing
It was.
Love
If it's fun, why not?
the dog has plot
Last DLC they released though..horrible
favourite thing
PLOT
Jmo4267: not interested into DLC
They released some decent DLC for it, but their last one was just pathetic.
http://theadmin.co.uk/img/xW0m3J.png anyone any good at design
cause im not
I heard you like dirt.
yup, trying to make a house using dirt as the primary construction medium
Needs moar dirt.
yeah, thats just the entrance hall atm
Interesting. Keep it up.
Was this a charity drive?
:D
hello?
Hey Flyboy.
what game is this?
Mother 3
oh... :(
this game is the saddest game i now of, sad as in depressing
Flyboy: try Nier
MadSurge: meh
who here has read rainbow factory
how you doing Flyboy
ohai alexxm
Flyboy: don't bring up that kind of fics :D
ALTAIR!?
MadSurge: awww...
but to be quite honest, its a bit sad...
I'll stick to the light side of the fanfics
Aw poor Alpha-Omega.
Gmornin.
Morning Starflash
you sleep well Starflash
Yeah pretty good
fell asleep too late though XD opening ceremonies... goddammit
Oh you had to remind me of it.
what did you think about them?
It was awesome
except the annoying Mccartney bandwagon, but hey, that's always the same with old glory
the 4th wall is destroyed
should of seen the chat
bitchin bout dr who the entire time
There was a dr who cameo.
:D That's a good one implying that you know me. I used to have those thought I used to be a bit of a psychopath you see and I don't want to end up being that way you see. That's a chapter in my life I prefer to not let live once again
I can't take this game seriously.
Seriously, there was, and it was pretty obvious too ^_^ tardis sounds & appearing and stuff
there was 2 references, tardis voice was used in the montage
Ah good, you heard it too.
and a great big 3d glasses wearing for no reason reference
Also, arctic monkeys.
<3
not sure whether to grow grass on my dirt house or not
Dang chat.
Wonder what type of muffins.
muuuffins
muffins for lunch
well the 4th wall got destroyed
No surprise there.
alexxm: these kind of games didnt start with 4th walls
oh god... this part
im going to give a hint. pigs
cows
flaming pigs.
thats all i will say
Flying flaming pigs will make my day.
Jmo4267: well then, consider your day, about to be made
5 a.m my objective of having no sleep is getting closer to being completed
Aww yeah.
told u so
i told you about explosions bro
see, flaming pigs
cheerful way to start the game
-.- that gives nothing away
Well this is..interesting
what does nitbread do
what an asshole
who is streaming anyway?
suddenly silenco
i have no idea
YES ITS WRONG OF YOU TO THINK THAT WAY
they worship a frog
Poor Flyboy.
Sebastian!!!!!!

SlurryMoon: Yes!!!! :O
03 heya

Nothing much just a regular morning or techinally afternoon

Derp
Phase4: autoplay?
Yay phase stream!!
well thats useful
awww...
00,02Flyboy, what livestream does when no ones streaming to it
i left mother 3 for this ;(
00,02Flyboy, that you did :P
Phase4: streams are best morning/afternoon streams :3
00,02little bit of hl2
I'm preferring this over Mother 3 to be honest. 6_9
00,02and this is my first time through the game
WOOOO PARTY TIME
00,02so no spoils please
Jmo4267: HOW DARE THEE! MOTHER 3 IS AMAZING
00,02also note that i suck at fps's
What you gonna do aobut it Flyboy?
about*
Phase4: True, dat
00,02dat is a nice looking menu screen
Phase4: it's okay, we still like you :D
00,02:3
/me 00,02hugs everyone
Jmo4267: THIS: *punched Jmo through the internet*
/me hugs back Phase4
I have never heard of this game up until today
/me hugs Phase4
How mean
;-;
00,02Alpha-Omega, half life 2?
no mother 3
...
Dat resolution.
00,02please note that i'm on easy
:D
Phase4: whats your gfav genre of game btw?
00,02Flyboy, puzzle
puzzzzzle.
00,02anything that makes me think
Phase4: i see, what about strategy?
00,02deus ex style games too
like starcraft for example
SuperBrony64 you should make a bunch of nutbread sandwiches
00,02rts games get a little frantic for me
Zerg rush. :D
Phase4: ever played toribash?
Phase4: its quite fun when you get used to it
parasprites
manhacks
00,02never heard of toribash
00,02does anyone here have magicka?
Phase4: i want it but it now work on my computer...
I'm embarassed to say I have it along with all the dlc. ;-;
Phase4: how about project zomboid? thats a pretty good game
Damn dlc.
I played project zomboid, that game is very interesting. Can't wait till the creator implements multiplayer.
Phase4: Nope, But i have seen and heard alot
Jmo4267: yh, i might get it at one point, ive only got the demo right now
00,02Jmo4267, i have most of the dlc because of sale
Same.
I bought the dlc as it was released. :$
morning everypony
Phase4: what about From Dust? if you havent heard of it then loo it up. it is AMAZING 6_9
SirGanjalf: morning
Morning SirGanjalf
One thing about Magicka is I wish they would fix multiplayer. Still too many bugs/glitches.
00,02Flyboy, i saw that during the sales but decided not to get it
rts games get frantic my arse... not compared to this game :D
Trine 2 is a great puzzle game. Played that through with a friend. Filled with lots of fun and laughter.
Phase4: have you god QUBE?
00,02it looks like i went the wrong way
00,02Flyboy, yup
Phase4: play that at one point! its awesome!
Phase4: Mount that turret in the tower!
:D
*james bond music plays*
Phase4: Mount the gun!
00,02??????
00,02How
00,02oh
Phase4: In the tower you pressed the button
00,02i see what you meen
Phase4: There that way it won't harass you for most of the time
What's with Gordon and helicopters? I remember there was one harrasing him in HL1 as well.
gordan freeman has no hands
^Then how he holds a crowbar/guns?
SirGanjalf: If the ground troops can't do the job, They send any type of armored vechicle to do it, And hes till manages to win
he*
SirGanjalf i have no idea
ooo music
Telekinesis is how he holds the crowbar. :)
Gordon must be half-unicorn!
peace
Driving quite well Phase4.

Oh Flyboy.
08,01moenin
lol k wouldnt work
...
dat kick :D
08,01i can't believe i'm actually up before midday...
well shit
08,01i've been gardening all morning
kicked tiwce -.-
08,01then it started raining
08,01thankfully
riddle time
I love the rain.
/me 08,01*hates* gardening
08,01with a *passion*
oh FOR FU- i still cand get the word right...
08,01<3
:D
<3
08,01so i've decided on a bass guitar
08,01i'm getting a Washburn AB10
08,01and i'm selling most of my instruments to pay for it
08,01clarinet, darbuka, french horn, one of my keyboards, possibly one or two mics
Phase4 Awesome part coming up
"no... im Phase4..."
08,01Jmo4267: the guitar costs nearly £400
00,02Flyboy, ikr
Fair enough. Hope it is worth it in the end :)
08,01if i don't sell the mics, i can probably get about £150 - £200
08,01Phase4: because the garden is overgrown
/me 08,01has a biiiig garden
00,02fair enough
00,02>big garden
00,02>does not like gardening
everything has a cehaper sound in £... until you realize it's 2.6 times your own curency :P
^
08,01Eli: what pisses me off is that most musical instruments are about the same number of $ and £
Eli: If not more
08,01this guitar is £375 or $385
don't buy them in £ then
I can't see the logic in that. 6_9
08,01$385 is roughly £300
buffer
08,01probably just under
it's always like this
08,01Eli: i wish i could buy stuff in $
08,01but earn money in £
08,01unfortunately, when you add duty and import tax, it negates the saving
well you can change at every bank
hellyeah!
08,01which means that i'd have to pay extra tax on it
Jmo4267: Analogously; games on Steam cost the same price in $ and €. And i can pay only in €:|
08,01both import tax and VAT, in fact
Eh
I'm from Australia so prices on Steam are a pain.
08,01Eli: it's way less than that now
08,01£300 = $472.46
Shame, since you can easily convert currency on paypal

WOO half-life!
whos streming?
Phase4: is
k
00,02i shot the g man
Phase4 how did that work out for you
:O
One does not simply shoot the Gman.
Phase4: Impossibru!
00,02alexxm, nothing happened
hello everyone :P
Hello Thrackerzod
HAAAAAX
Phase4 ?
oops nvm
hi Thrackerzod
my chat derped
how you doing Thracerzid
how you doing Thrackerzod
i'm good, but i seee that we have half life 2, i approve of this
lol, it's like Donkey Kong, with those barrels
00,02why are they sending troops after an armed airboat
is this before or after the helicopter battle?
Phase4: becuasewiorld war 1
08,01Flyboy: that's your excuse for everything
oh wait nvm i remember this part i know where u are now
who was just complaining about them sending troops?
00,02aiming and driving this thing is bullshit
one of the battles in world war 1 basically led the men to their deaths becuase the leaders were too stubborn and didnt listen to the troops
hence lions led by donkeys
i could never listen to a leader like that... i'm not fit for the army
thats 50% of army training , supressing the reflexive facepalm
Hi everypo- ooh more Half-Life! :O
I lol'd Trixiemuffin.
Hmm, not many people on right now
Hello to you too MegaMoonShine :P
hi MegaMoonShine
O.O

Wow, that's a lotta bombs

Hooray!
Better finish it off with the crowbar :D
well that was anti climactic
00,02Derpdash, i'm fine
that heli must've been 94% bombs
or explodium
i know that joke is getting old, but that stage was directed by michael bay
00,02where do i go?
Phase4: have you tried the GREY OUT OF PLACE GATE yet?
idk im at this part too
00,02SirGanjalf, secretly its the tardis?
jump off the ramp
high speed
00,02Flyboy, the what now?
other side of that platform/island Phase4
-.-
00,02i jumped off the ramp
00,02its closed
00,02?
over where the building is...
go there anyway
worth a try
Tardis, where?
...
you can jump the ramp if you are going fast enough and hit the ramp at the right angle.
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUu
:(
you must open that barrier
on your left
:D
There must be a switch to open the gate somewhere
well...
in a minute im going to die. from Phase4 cancer
that was worth it
Look to the left of the gate.
nooo

HAHAHA.
How does that boat even drive on land?

MegaMoonShine: airboats

PHYSICS
MegaMoonShine: it has a big propeller on tghe back
Well this is quite the situation.
O>O IMPOSIBRU
00,02thats enough hl2 for now
stairboat!
I'm sure the underside would end up getting ruined
Phase4: what now then?
Well, your destination is not far from here. You may just walk as well?
That was entertaining.
Phase4: kerbals!
oh right!
yayz
00,02Flyboy, not yet
kk
MegaMoonShine: not if it's on a air cushion, then the underside doesn't touch the ground
Makes sense
never played this before :(
^
^^
Shoukd U somewhat be reminded by Portal from this? Dem walls.
*I
*Should
Damn, gotta go for lunch
Bbl
00,02not sure why its lagging
00,02oh wait
00,02i know why
See ya MegaMoonShine
this game seems intresting
Out of curosity, how many games does everyone have on Steam?
5
22
Bravo Flyboy :P
Two ._.
i get a bit of a a Portal feeling from this game
none, still waiting for steam for linux ^_^
Eli: I know, right?
Not big numbers :<
eli, we all do, its the white walls and the fact that its a puzzle game i think
Eli: Portal inspired this game thats y
Portal + Rubiks's cube = This
you guys realise
this has some of the same staff as portal
right
they should finaly make online coop in Portal...
ell they did in 2
Eli: they have, portal 2
since when?
since launch
beginning?
lol
>_>
actually
wasnt the portal 2 announcment trailer
coop as well
ah but only the normal coop test run right?
so since announcement
Portal 2 Co-op was fun to go through, too short though.
hi everyone
Hello Lil_b
how you doing Lil_B
Hi Lil_B
thanks Jmo4267 alexxm and Derpdash
alexxm I'm fine thanks
00,02i'm not looking foward to this puzle
Didn't know you could look foward. :D
00,02Chrysalis|DI, the anouncment wasnt
This place looks even more sterile than Aperture in 1st Portal. Wonder what it is?
11,02Off to bed, night all O.O
00,02one of the tv spots was
Night SB64
00,02night SuperBrony64|Zzz , sleep well
i'm actually waiting for the comunity test chambers to be co-op . now that would be awesome
00,02SirGanjalf, qube
Phase4: More like the Rubik's cube, or the "Cube" movie cube?
00,02wat
SuperBrony64|Zzz: nighty night
Is there even a plot to this, or just puzzles?
nite SuperBrony64|Zzz
night
Anybody want a free steam game code?
sure
Eli: K4ZWF-MDMQI-NGJ0Q
i guess :/
It's just one.
So be quick.
And everybody races off to enter the code.
00,02i am going to compare this with portal
meh go for it. i'm to damn lazy
00,02because what other puzle game is it
00,02is there'
What game was it?
00,02derp
how do i use it Chocobunny ?
00,02Derpdash, steam menu thing
Go into steam, click the games tab then activate steam voucher I think.
00,02i'ma try
I might already have it /)(^3^)(\
00,02'activate game through steam'
what game was it anyways?
LOL
00,02wait
00,02how did i get that
Chocobunny: Yeah, but where do i put it?
00,02i honestly was not expecting to get that
LOL
00,02it was defense grid the awakening
Derpdash: Whoever is streaming got it.
Phase4: Ah, nvm. There's a movie called "Cube", about group of people trying to escape from some giant... cube, which is a deadly trap. But this place looks harmless. Like Rubik's cube:)
00,02Chocobunny, i did
Ah Defense Grid.
Phase4: Oh. :P
Tower-defence. Decent game.
00,02SirGanjalf, i think its harmless
oh ok Chocobunny
Who's streaming?
/me 00,02is
00,02i actually feel kinda bad, dont realy need more games :(
How many games you got Phase4?
00,02Jmo4267, far too many
00,02got the majority of them during the sale
Phase4: It's fine, mate. I didn't want that game anyways, I just backed some random company on Kickstarter, and got that code e-mailed.
Phase4: Then again; First test chambers in Portal were looking pretty harmless as well:P
More then my 376?
00,02SirGanjalf, true but there was an obviously insane ai
<3 Steam sales.
whoever game out the code, just crashed my steam :[
00,02Jmo4267, no... not more than that
/me 00,02hugs Flyboy
Haha fair enough. My list is too big. :$
Ffs, I hate how I have to wait 29 days for my Castle Story beta. ;_;
oooh looks creepy
Flyboy: I gave out the code, but you're too late anyways.
Flyboy: Phase4 already used it.
meh...
THEN IT GETS DARK
I hate Steam, as a matter of fact. It won't accept my credit card, so I can't really buy games on steam.
Jmo4267: Met your new Lord and Saviour, then: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7lu0mOGWn1r8fyvfo1_1280.jpg
00,02i saw this happening
HAHA. Oh god.
i like these rooms! they pretty
00,02it looks nice
00,02but playing it :/
I love you SirGanjalf.
I really like it's mane.
00,02they're adding quite a few mechanics
aww :)
00,02and theres no indication of that stopping
Was disappointed with the summer sale though. Only ended up buying 2 games. -;
time to post random memes from my little brony
alright everybody i'm going to head out got a big day tomarrow
i've bought 4
see ya
See ya lakingsfans
that is, if you count GTA complete pack as 1 game:$
I mainly bought games for friends during the sale. Other then that, most games didn't appeal or I already had them.
00,02nope
lakingsfans:Bye :)
00,02no more of that
lol
00,02hiding the components does not make the puzle more chalenging
Phase4: Play that game I got you.
:D
00,02that downloaded fast
Becaue it's not a huge game.
That desktop background.
Keeerbals
Whitescreen?
00,02powered by gamebreo
11,02Zzz
00,02and its put windows into that mode where theres no aero
00,02this can only go wel
00,02SuperBrony64|Zzz, seems legit
Phase4: I bet you'll cringe when you notice what genre this game is in.
/me sleep grabs Phase4
/me sleep hugs Phase4
/me 00,02hugs SuperBrony64|Zzz back
Stop hugging. ;_; I feel left out.
whats this?
Aw poor Choco.
/me hugs Chocobunny/
Lots of hugs for you.
Wait, what goal?
:D
Flyboy: This wa the game you tried to enter the code to.
oh right -.-
Meow.
TD.
oh god... TD... my least fav genre
TD everywhere.
i think i played this game before
Alexxm: Is it any good?
What's this?
I enjoy TD.
Chocobunny i think it was its just a tower defense game
This is Defense Grid SirGanjalf
Alexxm: It is a TD game.
Thanks Jmo4267

03 hey, is anyone streaming?
03 Oh, I guess so
Aw choco, why not?
SlurryMoon: Phase is
TD is fun.
SlurryMoon: Phase4 is.
00,02oh, i won
One does not simply win TD.
That's just disturbing.
That was it ._.

00,02fixing game lag
I hate this 10C weather. ;-;
Jmo4267: In my place there's 30C, wanna exvhange?

Defense Grid.
So many people asking 6_9
Really?
Yarly.
How original...
:$
I know right :D
do anyone know how to find the variable of resources with cheat engine ?
in this game
Defence Grid really is , game mechanic wise, absolutly no different fom any other Tower defense game, but I like it :)
Neat, a Doctor Who marathon
Where?
oh guys! i almost forgot! what happened at the end of the opening ceremony? when did the docter arrive?
Flyboy: He didn't...
well, almost everyone enjoyes a good tower defence game from time to time.
MegaMoonShine: FUUUUU
Flyboy: Television lied :'(
Flyboy hi didnt arrive
he was never planned to arrive
Who needs a dr who marathon? just watch all episodes online...
You guys been watching any of the events so far?
03 Hey, guys, I was thinking of letting you all watch me play Pokemon: Ash Grey version. It's a Pokemon rom hack. Would anyone care or should I just not bother?
that would have been great! but noooo... they just hadto show every other SMALLER tv show and forget about him..
MegaMooonShine what events?
The olympics ofc
OH SLURRYMOON
That'd be awesome.
In my opinion anyways.
SlurryMoon seems intresting hows it differnat from normal pokemon
who cares for the olympics...
Yeah SlurryMoon that'd be great!
03 you play as ash. it's basically the anime in game form
SlurryMoon sounds awesome
Do want.
go for it
seems intresting do ot
Sounds really cool
03 Alright, I'll hold off on playing it until after Phase finishes
By all rights, I should be way too busy today for Bronystate today.
And yet you're here. :$
...except for EMN
yep. gonna stay here for 5 hours and 41 min
and then for EMN oc
Which adds up to about 8 hours total
yeah, i got nothing to do :P
I was just downloading something and had to enter a Captcha... "Time Lord" Oo
O_______0

Helloooo? Anyoooone?

Nope, just dead
Ah. Fair enough :D

Does it keep buffering for anyone else?
Gold*

MegaMoonShine: Yeah, Doing it a little here
^
yes, but I'm also downloading 4 different things simultainiously XD
Tsk tsk.
?
Another boss?
Oh
this game seems intresting
there aren't realy "Bosses" in this game :/
This is that ridiculous dodge all the colors and shoot all the shit game, isn't it?
The slow guys with lots of HP are bosses.
Wut Buytoast.
You know, that one where you gotta dodge all the crazy patterns and shit.
This is not one of those games Buytoast
Uh, this is Defense Grid, a tower-defense game.
I think you're thinking of Beat Hazard or such.
^
Two different games :D
<3 Beat Hazard though.
This doesn't look like any tower defense game I've ever seen.
Jmo4267: Get a super spammy song and watch the colors going crazy
I know right.
Expecially when you turn the visuals to max. Bwahaha.
Jammy Dodger?
Jammie Dodger I should say.
00,02well i screwed that up
00,02i'ma continue that some other time
00,02who's still here?

Oh lord.

Quantum_bit: Afternoon
I'm fine
Just got back- OH YES L.A. NOIRE
You guys will probarly be able to help me with this; I just did a complete reinstall of my machine and I find myself without MLP wallpapers
W7?
Oh noooooo! :O
Any chance some of you got some links?
yes on windows 7
Did you upgrade to W7?
resolution is 1366x768
windows 7 always was on this machine
Cause there is a possibility you still have your old windows files and your wallpapers within them.
I don't think so
So there is no old.Windows in C:?
Thing is, I used the prompt to wipe my c drive, and then restored my os from the recovery partition
basically: format C:\
hell yeah :D
Ah, righto.
Was just a thought :$
naked women like a baws
BOOB
And I never had much wallpapers
Not that hard to find wallpapers really :P
^This
If you want the simple way, go to google images, search mlp wallpapers or some relative term and in the dimensions enter your resolution.
Phase4: go and touch that woman

That's kind of the point of the game.
00,02ip is 118.209.42.1
It's a game of up to four players.
oh my celestia. there are people rebuilding the roof outside and it's really bucking loud
Phase4: idk steam, i dont use it. i just heard that it was bugged in chapter 6 at some point
okayy
I haven't heard about all the bugs, only that there were a lot of them, and the game's a LOT better than it used to be.
oh man
I still remember release. :'(
THE PAIN.
NiGHTS
anyone else stuck on "connecting"
I'm stuck on Connecting
00,02Buytoast, what about her :P

So much connecting.
These people are going to be here ALL day! Normally, every weekday when I get home they already left

Only 3?
You sir, need to play it moar.

Ah that'll explain why.
/me slunks in :3

SlurryMoon: FR or LG?

How was the Magicka tream for everypony?

pinkyspice, my bf calls me that sometimes

pinkyspice: ash grey version
Was the dialog readable?

POOTIS Oak
I never heard of ash grey
dat Assman
Why is his face red now?
wtf?
dat lag
I have red, bluem yellow, silver,
^
Barbetos|AtWork: He's angry because his name is Assman now
Assman..Seems legit
http://www.vgcats.com/super/images/080423.gif
Mips's server is lagging
pinkyspice: it's fan made (romhack), follows the anime stroyline
SUPER EFFECTIVE.
yo everypony
ah
<3 That comic.
Personnally I would of named him Mssaan
They should make a Pokemon Rainbow version
http://www.vgcats.com/super/images/080428.gif
It's counter part would be Pokemon Emo edition.

http://www.vgcats.com/super/images/080505.gif
morning
Eulshy: Afternoon
This is a hacked fan game?
I'm always worried that the dialog in Magicka would get compressed into a size that people wouldn't be able to read.
Bingo MASF123
what we watching?
and so his internet died
Pokemon Bingo!
^
wow this realy seems like the anime
Best game ever in the series
Let's do dis.
BBBBBBINNNGGGGGGGOOOOOOOO
Y U Buffer?!?! :O
oh god what did i wake up to?
the hell is that ugly kid
Okay... first number... Pikachu 3!
Aw he used quick attack, watch out grandma!
Bulbasaur is obviously the superior choice.
I always choose bulbasaur
Eulshy, that is Ash Ketchum.
Chocobunny: i believe the water type is usually considered the best starter. fire being 2nd, and grass being 3rd
Assman motherfackin Oak
Ash looks ugly then
Wheres his hat?
assman is best ash
Chocobunny: for the overall game at least
Eulshy he was always ugly.
LOL^
Eulshy: never saw the very first episode of the anime?
Ingwaz: Grass is super effective against water and rock. I say grass is superior.
So, what's the point of Ash Grey anyway?
Is... Pidgeto really taht fucking big?
http://www.vgcats.com/super/images/081117.gif
Chocobunny: perhaps for the first 2 gyms, but i said for the overall game
great one
Kandarihu: You play as Ash?
Gold star for you MegaMoonShine.
I thought Pigeot would be that size.
QUICK! Kidnap one in your pokeball... Oak will never notice.
But I never even kept my bulbasaur, i went and caught a spearow and put my starter in the PC
Ingwaz: During that time you're bound to catch more pokémon.
Oh, is that it? It's just a simple sprite change?
Also, hi dudes :$
HAI.
Chocobunny: early pokemon are generally weak pokemon
MegaMoonShine hello.
how you doing MegaMoonShinw
how you doing MegaMoonShine
Awesome, alexxm :)
3 balls...which will he choose?
Chocobunny: also, grass will not keep the type advantage later on
stream problems
the 4th hidden one containing mew!
I hate Mew.
how come
Eulshy, I thought it was only me experiencing stream problems! :O
Do you know what it takes to capture him?
DO YOU?
oh the puns
http://www.halolz.com/2012/06/23/twilight-princess-new-moon/
Jmo4267 you have to glitch or get him in some sort of event.
I know.
That's why I hate him.
http://mirror1.lolbot.net/2523.png
/me loves Mew
/me falls out of air vent
/me indifferent Mew
! IMissOsamaBrony
/me dodges falling IMissOsamaBrony
YOUVE HAD TOO MUCH TO DRIN!
K!
Can never have too much to drink.
wtf?
what are we watching?
OWNED!
Pokemon: Ash Grey
Pokemon: Ash grey
Ash is the worst pkmn traina eva!
ditch pikachew
Where's my chicken dammit? Oh wait, this isn't the KFC website? :O
its a rom hack
of fire red I think
IMissOsamaBrony: A modded version of Pokemon where you play as Ash
... Oh no...
PONYTA!
Does that mean Misty follows you around in the game?
nopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenope donotwant
Don't forget Brock too
i remember first watching this episode when it was first out in england
MegaMoonShine but isent that the same as regular pokemon when you name your charicture "Ash"
Will this go corrupt and kill us all?
is someone playing this on a emulator?
Wait. I go away for a few minutes, and you have a Pikachu named another Pokemon.
I thought it seeing she is the 2nd gym leader, but maybe you hate to beat her... :/
GET FUCKDDDDD
I dunno really IMissOsamaBrony :$
so many typos. @_@ OMG
So, I got to play Super Mario Bros Wii "U" last night
And how was it?
MegaMoonShine lol :)
so this is the games justifaction for having so many com mons in one area
ITS PIKACHU NOT PONYTA
FUCK YOU SPERROWS
I can safely say if you liked Mario Bros Wii you'll like the new version
SWIM!!!
AYH
Why is the Pikachu named Ponyta? :S
MISTY!!! :O
Haha Swim should replace surf
FUCK SPERROWS
and if you thought Mario Bros Wii could destroy friendships, Wii "U" can nuke them and desecrate the remains
I like the sound of that.
Yeah lol
Okay. It's just railroading you into the anime canon.
pokemans!
One person plays on the tablet... and can add temporary physical blocks to the game world
mon*
dodododo-dododododo-dododododdododododo
Stupid stream stop freezing
like, above the other players, when they're trying to jump over pits
Rofl.
I think it is named Ponyta to serve as a loophole.
Oh, and thats just what I could verify
I can see that turning out well...
how was friday night movie night?
The stream keeps freezing.
supposedly the system supports up to 4 normal players and 2 tablets at the same time
PinkietheBoss:actually its pokemon...
IMissOsamaBrony: Insanely hilarious
I only was able to verify 4 players + 1 tablet
I hope Nintendo realizes that people are going to be trolling each other with that.
Wow, Viridian City already?
NullRadix, I would trap people
AttacktheAndalite what movies?
You can't trap people indefinitely
/me watches Rain slink in
Damn it.
My plans ruined.
Dam it
IMissOsamaBrony: A movie was Dark Crystal. B movie was Flash Gordon
YOU SHALL PAY WITH YOUR BLOOD
My brother and I... tried that
damn. that thing has a major buffering problem at my place
'tried'
I still was able to beat the first level
it took a few tries and a significant amount of time
So much buffering, damn you MIPS!
AttacktheAndalite WHY IS IT NEVER RAMBO FIRST BLOOD!?!?!?!?!?? AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
but I got past the barricades
They also had a competition for which "team" could beat the first level the fastest
THE BARRELS ARE MAKING IT BUFFER!
NullRadix, I'm sure one could trap people indefinitely, but not permanently. Unless there's something specifically preventing the guy with the tablet from placing a block in a space where a block was less than a second ago.
ADMINS I WANT RAMBO FIRST BLOOD FOR NEXT WEEKS FRIDAY NIGHT MOVIE NIGHT!!!!
and my brother and I won
He possesses the Royal Canterlot voice!
:O
the hell is his pikachu named ponyta?!
IMissOsamaBrony put it as your lotery choice for next week
then we fought over the luigi plushie that was the prize
IMissOsamaBrony: I have yet to win lottery. Also, when you get a newsletter now, you have until Thursday to take the survey so that they don't take up Intermission time to decide on which movie qualifies as A or B
Ash! Quick! Punch James in the dick, pummel meowth, and seduce Jessie! Its the only way.
alexxm how?
Er, okay. I should ask, is there something to prevent the tablet guy from constantly placing blocks in the teammate's way, even after it despawns?
http://www.vgcats.com/super/images/091202.gif
IMissOsamaBrony:beware you dont always get what you want in here
um... not explicitly, but they do have to tap in just the right place
Ponyta used Thundershock!
I see
and if you "double tap" a block, it gets smaller and they can hit it for coins
So it takes skill to troll
WHAT
sonicandmario85 I SAT THROUGH MODERN WORMFARE 2 I DESERVE RAMBOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
When did Super Effective get all the way to Brock?
you could refine your SMB trolling skills to an art, I'm sure
So cold ;-;
Whos streaming?
YOU'LL GET NOTHING, UND LIKE IT!!!
it got all the way to mt. moon
love that 'boop'
Shooeie: Slurrymoon
and then just kinda stopped
I know, I was just making fun of its...sporadic update schedule :3
2 years ago >_>
Which pokemon is this?

He finally caught that Clefairy, at least.
Siezures. Ash's backup plan for team rocket.
(after about half a year)
VenHur96: Nope, pokemon ash grey
FUCK THAT BITCH< ASH
*throws acid at imissosamabrony*

o_o
VenHur96: It's a rom hack
sonicandmario85, that's not holy water
/me laughs because sonicandmario85 is a n00b and dident throw it cuz it wasnet an action ^^
And Green continued being adorably psychotic.

Oh great, see what you did, now he's delusional. :/

and stay interested in it
>_>
Pffffff doesn't keep the caterpie anyway
you know pika piii
:D
This is going to get confusing
How helpful sign, I totally didn't know that
Why is slurry naming all his pokemon Ponyta? :S
You know what would probably make him interested again? MONIES.
MegaMoonShine: Y not?
Someone should fund it.
Cause Ponyta is hardcore.
because ponies are best
MegaMoonShine: because its slurry?
ahhhhhh mad lagggggg
when they evolve will he renamed them Rapidash?
Hey y'all
she likes Ashes pokeballs
uh i beleive that was just the fast forward feature
XD
indeed
He has the power to warp time!
What a minute, I don't remember Ponyta being yellow. >:[
after a while people probably just stopped buying his merch so he just lost intrest like they did
hey Fisheh_Fish how you doin today, baby
Hey Fisheh_Fish :)
MegaMoonShine:actually its a emmulator hes using i think and hes using fast forward
Pretty good IMissOsamaBrony

OH MY FUCKING GOD
Tomba! is on the psn now! :O
Ah, Samurai... but ehe's not using Metapod?
So who are we watching?
why are we watching this?
IMissOsamaBrony: Because it's epic
^
Damn you digital wallet, why do you not have just 5 more dollars on you!?
because its better than the cartoon?
^
like my fucking god they just added it last month
/me demands digimon. :U
wtf
an epic battle
a medopod name ponyta?
medapod*
pinkyspice: Metapod*
rffruuh
thank you
Petopod.
/me never thought she would see this game on the psn seeing as WHOOPEE CAMO Co. went under a long time ago
why the tatarus is it name ponyta?
Sounds.. kinda gross acutally.
This is gonna take a long time
this game seems to have too much railroading
pinkyspice: Because ponies?
and whats with the horrid lag
but why not celestia?
/me starts throwing glowsticks around the movie theiture, singing old negro spirtuals
or twilight?
or even apple?
maybe big mac?
they even have a video preview for it, instead of a slideshow of pics
Big Mac got too much swag
/me is epic happy right now
it would break the game
Maybe cause ponyta is also an actual pokemon
/me collects the glowsticks
uber nalstalgia
/me turns the chat into a rave
In which case... what would he name a ponyta? :S
for the lols, of course
Rapidash
Ponyta of course.
annd rapidash ponyta?
um...
/me throws throwing glowstick and hits pinkyspice
yup
/me catches the glowstick before it hits the floor and throws it at IMissOsamaBrony head. :U
/me watches it as the glowstick splatters all over IMissOsamaBrony
EVOLVE
buck logical evolution, my pony-bug is now a pony-butterfly thing

:U
i watched it last night on my 50" projector :P
/me takes MegaMoonShine high def tv
pinkyspice: Why you little... :|

/me waits for the sedatives in the acorn to take effect

Ohai Jim :)

They should make a Pokemon Snap 2. And add some Wub Wub to it.
I'm a bronystater and I'm OK, I sleep all day and I watch stream all night.
It's 11:32 a.m. here in New Jersey.
Yeah MASF123, that was a pretty good game
11:33PM IN AUSSSSIE.
Jim: wrong order. the all day part comes after the all night part
They say I sleep all night but I work all day, right?
yeah i think so
or something along those lines
hey errypony

SlurryMoon: omg why is he so stupid?
Viewers these days...
03 REally now
^^
03 this is just stupid

So is this just a video from Youtube or is someone streaming this?

>.> v.v <.<
Buytoast i poed the mod
Buytoast: We're watching Pokemon and a ban about to happen shortly
/me hides as he senses the ban hammer
:D
@SlurryMoon what did he do involving his name?
MASF123, I'll PM you
MASF123 i cant have Osama in my name, i guess
nm
MASF123: just read it. "I miss osama brony" and he changed it to "usta like the mods"
it was more of the "I miss Osama" bit
Oh sweet jesus marmalade the audio is like a thousand satsnist prostitutes riding the demon pole of sandpaper delight
i would assume he dosent like Osama
ustalikethemods: he murdered people you ass
We have people from all over the world here, including the US.
and Britain
08,01Buytoast: so basically, your mum's O noise
03 Guys, please return your attention to the stream
and in case you didn't know, you should go google 9/11/01
Hey Everypony
Bronysith so? lots of people murder peole
03 this is a chat that is for BronyState
SlurryMoon: didn't you get a ball of lightning?
ustalikethemods: it is just really offensive
03 Please refrain from talking about thing off topic

Vuytoast what
i cant tell what is happining in pokemon.... everything is either going really fast or is paused...
also, what in the hell kind of pokemon game is this
Damned, my username got Derped. :/
Uh...
did anyone else just read that
frameskipping through the fight
name's too long? take a vowel out of it xD
read what?? i didn't read a thing, nope, not here.. nothung
o_O
alexxm, Yes, and I'm just as o_o as you
What did I miss again?
Hmm, does the stream freeze up after like 2 seconds for anyone else?
In the chat I mean.
i is skared i iz get kikd
Jim: Yup
Yeah MIPS is on her period as usual.
Derpy123, don't... ask...
08,01i think my nettle stings were retroactive karma for that joke, Buytoast
ponibas, but I already did. :O
Eh, I didn't mind it.
Anything is funny to me.
Oh...I can switch back now. :)
08,01Buytoast: even war?
Even war.
War, war never changes
Except when it does
Jim: lol
What's... going on with stream now?
if you can't laugh at the bad, you don't deserve to laugh at the good.
Jim: i love fallout
wth is happening oO
also what in the world is happening with this video
hyper-grinding exp with frameskip set up on the emulator
/me brohoofs Buytoast but quietly so i dont get banned /)
Buytoast: when a woman and a table love eachother very much
08,01Buytoast: i think you now qualify as a candidate for the US Presidency
I think slurry just broke spacetime
nettles are a plant with really sharp points
they suck
Slurry, stop breaking the space time continum o_o
08,01Rap Battles are pretty cool too
So am I safe to assume this is some Pokemon television series modded pokemon emulation?
friday by rebecca black is musical warfare. that's kinda funny too
>Wake up, see "y6umjh [{{,:M lkjmc1t42,-" typed into my browser bar. Remember seeing a cat last night.
>Yup, it's been sleeping on my keyboard
I've seen Twilight vs Trixie and Fluttershy vs Rainbow Dash.
Jim: Aww :D
08,01AttacktheAndalite: it's pretty awesome
08,01blueblood vs. big mac
Bronysith i have a hard time beleving you are a true brony, sir. i thought MLP was about kindness and friendship and i havent been gitting either from you...
нажатием
08,01hmmm... blueblood and big mac...
ustalikethemods: and how is osama about kindness and friendship?
ustalikethemods you should not put so much stock into a tag line. Thats all it is.
ustalikethemods: you are obviously a troll so get the fudge out
inb4 ban?
PLEASE AttacktheAndalite
lol
Hi everypony, do we have a pet troll today?
Hi BronyJenkins
nah, most likely inb4 mods tell people to calm down
Bronysith: O U
Bronysith that is my username in all my videogames and i do admit to trolling, just not bronys
This is going to sound pretty nooby but, what does inb4 mean?
BronyJenkins: yes, it is ustalikethemods as the troll
Alright.
ustalikethemods: why would you miss osama? he was a completely evil man
08,01ustalikethemods: how old are you?
MASF123: in before something happens, basically
MASF123: in before
ustalikethemods: it is like saying you miss hitler or stalin
This time i'm taking the break from being the asshole
yep
or satan
08,01ustalikethemods: figures
xD
Bronysith i dont... its a joke....
MASF123: basically means along the lines of "dibs" or "bags" although more based on humourous guessing or jokes
/me shrugs
???
ustalikethemods: that is not a joke man.. it is like saying "Bombing hiroshima was funny." or "Baby rape is good stuff"
Woah ustalikethemods is still here?? :o
Converting all my mp3's on youtube to seem legit is quite laborious
08,01or "Cher is a good singer"
Drama, drama everywhere
^
^^
Just ONE
/me don his opera cape
/me laughs when Bronysith says 'boming hiroshima was funny'

08,01in case you do
/me yawns
Hi bronystate.

Hello FillyFlam

Kandarihu: Slurrymoon
Y'alright FillyFlam?

slenderman
remember, SlurryMoon, your flashlight attracts him
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7rg04MPXE1rbjck1o1_1280.jpg
0,5I like bacon
08,01Meanwhile: Cher is a "singer"
An indie jumpscare game....
The buffering is killing it for me :(
yup MegaMoonShine
mips is PMSing I guess
yeah that buffer kills the suspense
Hmm, how long is it?
:O
Is it scarier than Amnesia?
you know the legend of slederman thats what this is all about
Fisheh_Fish nah
It's not even working for me!
Awwww
Well, it is
Nevertheless, I shall check it out
I actually completed Slender. C:
How does a Slenderman look like?
Fisheh_Fish i watched the first 3 parts of that game and was bored out of my mind
I thought Cher was a giant pair of lips that happened to be able to get a record contract?
MASF123 tallman in a suit no face
^
^^
Oh, you'll see, Masf
Fisheh_Fish firs t3 parts of the walkthrough
refreshed stream
MASF123: Well he's a very lithe fellow.
not with all this buffering I won't. -_-
ustalikethemods: Does it get interesting after that?
Refreshing doesn't help
08,01meh, computer games
i got to 6 pages...never played it again
08,01i remember when everyone just played chess and was done with it
Com-pew-tar
Fisheh_Fish i dont know i stopped watching :D
Oh!
:D
Slender mang!
i cleared slender on my first try and it wasnt even that scary. C:
I saw that movie Cher was in with Wynona Ryder. It's okay...
buffer.
08,01Rain: what do you honestly think the answer to that question is going to be?
No
/me observes screen carefully
08,01indeed
I do the one in the building first, cos hes likely to jump you there.
slener:O
Unnr|Laptop, I cant manage to get my hands on Go
Back in my day you had to walk five miles uphill in the snow to play chess.
/me poops his pants in supence
ooooh, fun quote from Notch: " Every character and animal in Minecraft is homosexual "
Turn around for fun times!
08,01Unnr|Laptop: but we only had one set pieces *between* both sides
Meanwhile, well in my day when chess was invented we didn't have this newfangled board and had to play on a doughnut
08,01Rain: i don't play computer games
...I'm about to look it up on Google this is taking to long.
Unnr|Laptop: lol'd.
Jim and the reproduce asexually.
is slender susspose too be free?
08,01Rain: i don't find them fun
Rain, because PC is master race
they*
08,01Meanwhile: i was about to mention that WoW is an exception
Microwave games are the best
i can just imagine being that guy and just walking through there being like 'derp-a-derp-a-herp-a-derp
WoW has a way of making you forget everything else.
Byzantine chess is alot of fun to play
LAG ATTACK
i love playing games on my microwave, best console
08,01though, I find my interest in it waning
Desktop fillies will distract me from slenderman :D
LAG
Unnr|Laptop: that is awesome
Jim, your Microwave ain't got shit on my toaster 64.
Unnr|Laptop: Ooh, that looks interesting.
ACDC is distracting me from slenderman :D
Queens hop, medieval style
and rooks become insanely powerful
I never got the appeal about WoW, not even when it came out.
Im playing off my blender
I play games on a fried boot...
So MUCH Lag
08,01Unnr|Laptop: heh, closed chess space
jezz man what is with this lag i feel like playing some tf2 to release my rage on everyone
300 derpys are attacking my screen
ustalikethemods lies
08,01Meanwhile: it's not that. it's the actual playing of it i find boring.
ok I'm going now. This lag is annoying.
08,01it's just grind grind grind, really
OK.....brb......hope to be back for Euro Movie Night
Meanwhile: does that matter? Sure there will be a few new features in the new expansion, but the basic game will stay the same
he could have desktpo ponies
...who is streaming?
Pandaland is out Sep 25
God, what is wrong with my internet?!
is anyone else's stream frozen on the view of a hallway?
NullRadix: Dunno, I stopped playing like, a month ago.
Even Youtube is buffering videos!
oh dear giid
Cypresswolf, yes.
08,01maybe i'm just not focused enough on it to appreciate it
BarbetoslAtWork nope, desktop ponies
maybe he should fix the stream
Wait nvm it's fine now
oh wow, they actually ask if you want to try again instead of just closing the game now?
ded?
darn
ded
...
indeed Spectrum_Rush|Busy
03 wait what happened?
He ded
03 did you guys not see Slenderman?
08,01i guess my play style has changed... i used to be really into the RP side and giving my character a backstory, adding to it as i levelled up
No.
if you look at him too long, you loose
no I didn't
08,01now it's just about numbers for me
nope the stream is lagging way to much
It lagged too much
SlurryMoon we can't see shit because it buffers every ten seconds.
SlurryMoon: Too much buffering. Cant se anything :/ -lol
The stream came back on after you had died.
I always thought Minecraft was stupid. Like when I heard the name I'd just to "Really? What the fuck?" This is coming from someone who can play Sims for hours on end without getting tired.
nope all i saw was buffer.
The buffer monster came and buffered the viewers to death.
The stream keeps blockin out
tickle me buffer
very staticy
buffermonster got me
08,01Meanwhile: Terenas
The buffering made it hard to see the Slenderman.
We heard static and nothing else
come in SlurryMoon you're breking up, over
lol dat world of goo sounds fun
08,01alliance side
AttacktheAndalite: -lol silly filly.
I can hear you
08,01come find me; my character's name is Titnuzl
No.
This is the first I have heard from your mic
we hear you
It was just static before
/me misses the days of the WoW beta, when you would never be sure if you would log in to find your character naked in the middle of nowhere
Dat slurry voice :3
besides the slenderman scares me :S
Nope
Are you sending your stream through radiowaves?
08,01i have another character on the same realm as Wrek
We couldn't hear anything.
green and purple.
08,01i called her Bumteez
SlurryMoon: nope
Staticy hello
08,01or Bumtees, actually
Liokin_: I know. I'm having fun now. I've built a house next to the water, and planning on a small town. Only problem is because I got mines for free, I can't join a server
Hoity-Toity is swag
he is probablyy using on of those old radio stations for his stream
Your mic was muted, even during the time it wasn't buffering.
We can hear you, but *buffer*
...kind of it cutting off a bit
SlurryMoon: nope no transmission during the game
lakingsfans: have you ever heard of or played any SCP?
There's still a buffer.
/me 08,01is surprised that his characters haven't been reported for dodgy names yet
Cypresswolf: the what now?
...of the side...all I could re....ly af....ford.
:D
^
We're gonna be watching The Dark Crystal soon. How about we play some Moonbase Alpha ahead of it?
good evening bronystate :)
AttacktheAndalite: True -lol you'll go crazy and start talking to yourself if you play single player too long.
08,01Titnuzl is level 61 gnomish rogue
derp a derp
Alrighty then- *buffer*
hey derpy_pony how've you been
Hi derpy_pony
good evening derpy_pony :)
08,01she has an eyepatch!
08,01Eli: Terenas
the buffermonster still beckons
Lol. I wanna be the Guy is on the list of non Steam games.
AttacktheAndalite: But to get online youll either need to pirate. Or just buy the game :3
Liokin_: It's already happened. As soon as the sun goes down, I go to bed because the creepers and shit comes out.
"Excuse me." *buffer*
lakingsfans: SCP Containment Breach is a horror game where you try to trap a concrete statue - much like a weeping angel - you can't blink or look away from it :)
Slender is pretty to look at
AttacktheAndalite: -lol XD
o_O
Liokin_: I already got a free version of a Sims 3 EP. But that shouldn't have anything to do with it because PowerISO
hey derpy_pony you've missed teh best part yesterday at the olympic opening
Cypresswolf: shit sounds like a fuun game i'll have to look into it exuse the pun
AttacktheAndalite: Make swords and armor and traps and what not to defend your little hovel with :3
what should i do in skyrim...
MURDER SPREE
Eli? which part?
Cypresswolf: Isn't CB in beta?
Can't wait for movies. I missed it yesterday cuz I was watching the olympics.
AttacktheAndalite: yes
Any female mods here? I am hoping to hear a chick stream their voice.
Didn't hear me during the who- -sle- *buffer*
Liokin_: I swear, I was scared one time because I thought a zombie had actually gotten into my house.
they mentioned 'harmony' and 'discord' in the same sentence
MASF123: Forever alone level 9001.
Cypresswolf: I would like to play it when it's done
MASF123, the only mod who I'm aware of is female is Shizuka. And she doesn't use a mic.
I'll be back for movie night. Laters! :)
Eli: not that unusual in music
Meanwhile, not funny. :|
Meanwhile: what does the scouter say about his alone level?
The screaming was implied.
AttacktheAndalite: -lol XD yeah. It get that way. Thats why you have to come online and join wrek's castle or SB's uhhh...are thing.
Bronysith: It's over nine thousaaaaaaaand
AttacktheAndalite: play it in the dark - I dare you :)
Meanwhile: what nine thousand?! there must be some kind of mistake
Liokin_: So I stayed my scary butt upstairs and slept
Bronysith: No he's literally /that/ lonely.
Cypresswolf: I was on creative mode :3
Meanwhile: oh...
-lol if your on creative mode you cant die >:3
The opening of the Olympics was amazing.
welp what a good stream i waltz into
Liokin_: you're*
Does Slender require a lot of processing power? I'm considering getting it.
AttacktheAndalite: If your on creative mode you cant die >:3 -lol just go kill them.
Meanwhile: Trixe*
Trixie*
Liokin_: I tried joining a server. It says User not premium. I can't play the browser version, and I thought that one was free
lakingsfans, not sure but I'm about o leave this one.
Liokin_: *you're
Last night, I thought about buying a copy of Minecraft. Turns out it's $27. No thanks.
Your stream sucks worse. *buffer*
Meanwhile: im surprised you didnt correct his (your)
Meanwhile: You'd know how to spell her name alright.....te he
Bronysith: I did correct his "your"
AttacktheAndalite: You have to buy the game. Browser version lets you play solo for free.
i am soooo *buffer* bored
Liokin_: Who wouldn't? It's just Trix (like the cereal) with an 'ie' at the end
AttacktheAndalite: Cause trixie is his waifu. Was my point.
this buffer is worst than EA DLC
Liokin_: I tried browser version. Still says user not premium
If you're bored, kindly say so to the nearest wall. Because it will care more than anyone else does.
Fix the stream, then play it again.
AttacktheAndalite: Yeah, you HAVE to buy the game to connect to the servers.
AttacktheAndalite: Or set up a hamachi.
Meanwhile: i don't have a wall
AttacktheAndalite: But the hamachi thing is just anal.
Liokin_: I thought he disowned her. But she's not as bad as DT. I think SS just sticks by because of influence
lakingsfans: Borrow one from a friend.
Liokin so there are lite versions
Meanwhile: mkay
I tried Hamachi. I got confused and said "fuck this shit"
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA THIS BUFFER
Don't start another game with the stream like this!
It's infuriating!
There's nothing even streaming anymore, so Idk why you're complaining about buffers.
AttacktheAndalite: He does, but that doesnt stop me from rubbing her in his face.
It's buffering? I thought the stream was shut off! :O
the stream is just off
Oh ok then. :)
Liokin_: Kinda like otakon is shipped with any/everything somehow?
AttacktheAndalite: And yeah. -lol you need a tech savy person like ol' satty or phase. Or wrek. Otherwise you will sit there for days trying to get that thing to wrok -lol
Mfw people can't tell the difference between buffering and absent.
i'm hungry and a box of coaco pebbles are calling me
What's the lottery results?
Absent is ultimate buffer
AttacktheAndalite: Basically. But theres no rule against me trolling Meanwhile x trixie. So I take advantage.
Meanwhile no one takes the time to look if it says "On Air"
Spectrum_Rush|Busy: Like no one takes the time to read the rules or the movie night clock.
I'm back! :$ whose desktop is this?
Sorry. Now that I think about that, that's not true.
how you doing MadSurge
MadSurge, SlurryMoon's desktop
the buffermonstersdesktop
Liokin_: lol and I could get fussed at because I got mines for free. Oh well, still having fun. I might ask them...when I get over the tiny fear
he might have gone to bed, guys.
also, the stream is off
Kandarihu: Pony icons! :O SO AWESOME!
its not buffering
it is just showing the last image that it had on it
Liokin_:Disregard fear, acquire squid ink
if you refresh, it will be blank
Rain: Sad how you can say it several times but no one pays attention isn't it.
Dat kick
Rain it is blank
Meanwhile: http://derpy.me/GMK34
dat lyra makes me want to play steam
AttacktheAndalite: Not really. I doubt anypony wuold really care how you got it. I mean the game is only like 10 or 20 bucks I think.
Ey everypony
Liokin_: mmmmm
Allo robotdragon8.
Ohmygawd guys, shut up. This is the best episode
AttacktheAndalite: So honestly I'd say go for it. I got bored with minecraft offline in a matter of days.

MASF123: Unless given an image to make I usually just pull whatever's buffering at the time off the screen.
Good Morning From my personal Hell. :D
Braviary: Yeah but you know some shows even when they're old, there's that one episode that still makes you laugh

how long did it take you to find that derpy_pony?
i love the buffer show
spiiiiiiiike....
hm?
it's on the frontside
The Buffer Channel, showing Buffer 24 hours a day
now with 20% more buffer
they get more viewers by accident
derpy_pony you summed up how most people here felt about it
Bronystate: Making buffer 20% cooler
this buffer beats youtube buffer which is 5 seconds of video buffer for 5 minutes
while we wait
and youtube has 10 minute ads which are unskippable
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3a1ZR6Y2YQ&feature=g-u-u
I should have brought a camcorder to record this moment on Bronystate, this buffer only comes once every few hours. -_-
GAWH
D
how many rotations per minutes are these?
174
It's only technically buffering if something is meant to be playing.
Brother-Aura: TL;DW
As it stands it's just a loop.
i had appendicidis and my surgery scars are FINALLY healing.
good
lakingsfans ....
man I must be tired... I thought you wrote Sugary scars
You know they could just put an image and leave music looping for a while.

weird but awesome
Run away from the GhOST!

wheeee
Weeeeeeeeeeee
weeeeeeeeeee
So much bitch. /me takes several more shots
wheeee
Well that was mood killing.
but wih better animation, awesome action, and supernatural stuff
i can imagine adult swim playin this series
Don't open it!
3 hands!
DON'T DO IT
SY.
FY
What a dumb bitch
Here's Johnny!
I really liked Adult Swim as it was at the beginning. Regular CN was so inhibited, that everything became predictable.
So what's the point of the three hands?
Ok
Meanwhile: Something
OK?!?!?
Behind YOU!
Meanwhile: the other girls mayhaps
slender girl
XD
Long arms.
AHHHH!
String_Shredder nah, she has a face ^^
What.
O_O
OMG
rape tiem
Frankly, I didn't have any interest in any of the other channels, so I still stuck with CN. One night, near the end of the year 2000, I had the TV on when I was sleeping. I woke up at 2 in the morning to something different.
All sorts of creepy up in the chat
that was smart...
Cameras will work!
ok credit where credits due some of the monsters in this do look creppy
Ah Comera Light is not Sunlight...
Now, you die!
That's just weird.
My Space!
XD
00,10most of them are creapy
Didnt like that did you bitch!
so much bitch
the bitch counter has broken
/me takse a shot
They were basically incomplete pilots of the original generation of Adult Swim series, and they were all so much better and freeer than anything I saw on CN before. It wasn't obscene or depraved, it was just nice and edgy.
00,10it's just hard to keep things spooky with out being silly too.
before the Euro stream?
Oh drinking game AttackTheAndalite? What are we looking for?
Dem boots.
Kandarihu: as much as this is gag-filled, its good :)
Barbetos|AtWork: All the times the word 'bitch' was said in this episoe
Obi :D
obi wan kenobi
Sumica: it is, but i think this one pulled it off really well
Gay angels.
Barbetos|AtWork: yep, frist time my counter broke
now THAT was a ghost story
dun dududun dun
Months later, Adult Swim burst on the scene, and those wierd toons I saw, I saw again.

During the opening ceremony show sergio_scriptor? It was constant british culture references e.g. there was a 2 second shot of a popular kids movie from the 70s/80s.

During the agriculture part?
I never saw the upcoming movie!

Close the doors.
11,01Yep.
:'(
NOOOO
No, not the cages!
Silverscreen : Hide the drugs
Take them to the brig!
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Garthim costumes were so heavy that the performers had to be hung up on a rack every five minutes to rest whilst still in costume.
:o
11,01I don't go out very often.
As an adult. The similarities between this and Metroid are suprising.
And that doesn't work? It does for me. :/
11,01Because I don't know what to do.
I'm impressed to this day. It's still a masterpiece is mass puppetry.
It's that bird.
skank?

Skankteees?
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Mmmmmmm

the TWILIGHT ZONE!!
the twilight zone
The Forbidden Forest
Don't go in it it's dangerous!!!
And then the Gelf became Batman
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: From a budget of $15 million, the film made slightly over $40 million, a rather disappointing figure. This was put down to the fact that many parents felt the film was too scary for their children and also because it opened against the box office juggernaut that was E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.
Too late.
FUCK DONT.
so blue!
11,01And had hip surgery. I don't mind helping her, but her calling me on the phone frequently when I'm in the same house and complaining to family members about everyone else is depressing.

The Cavalary Goes!
reference much?
adorable and horrifying,, Pinkamena?
Go faster!
OH MY GOODNESS IT WAS REFRENCED.
RainbowJack: that's because they based their design off of these
FINALLY, I'M BACK.........................Fucking chores
That, is no ordinary rabbit. It's a killer rabit
Prophets should've accounted for landstriders.
another reference to add to the list
Silverscreen: and now we have to find out if that was a referance or a coincedance
No..... :(
it needs more lazer guns
valoreins: adorable and horrifying : slenderman ?
01,11RANDOM QUESTION: If made today, would this movie fare better being made with CGI or kept as puppets?
oh fluttershy will not be pleased to see this
What are they doing to them?
sergio_scriptor: could be..
Nightmare fuel incoming
stereostype mad scientist
yes Silverscreen
Electric chair?
puppets are unusual. everyone uses cgi, Silverscreen
Silverscreen: Puppets.
I used to be a hero like you, Till i took a baby to my hoof.
Silverscreen: it depends if it's good cgi
We don't want to hurt you, we will just kill you
Doctor. Are you sure dis vill vork?
Silverscreen: I can't help but feel this was meant for puppetry.
You can use you mouth to drain his essence :I
PULL THE LEVER KRONK!
Silverscreen if the MUPPETS can still put on a movie together, then MUPPETS all the way
Lava.
Silverscreen: well, puppets cost less, so it's cheaper unless somebody else made a 3d model. They'll lose less,
Silverscreen: Puppets
11,01Look into the stone dildo.
come to the dark side
Don't look!
derp face
so they'll have a less negative profit
brain meeelt
One of the reasons I liked the Hellboy movies was because they used a lot of puppets instead of CGI-ing everything.
You will be assimilated into the herd! Resistance is futile!
nice, Nittany_Discord
hes watching the ifrst episode of mlp
Don't Look!

you can't make much facial expression work with a puppet

Still walking.
Crabs!
The spycrabs have returned!
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Brian Froud's fascination with lobsters led to many crustacean touches in the design of the film, particularly in the design of the Garthim, the henchmen of the Skeksis.
DOVA!!!
sergio_scriptor: do u know what brony state is ?
Crabby crab crab.
