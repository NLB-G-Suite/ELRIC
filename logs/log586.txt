This is an episode where a pony's element of harmony is actually a detriment.
Pinkie's talent is parties, but she's training to be a baker.
A-GAME

laughter is best element
you'd thinking with how often pinkie breaks the 4th wall one should just be able to reach into the screen eventually

lol
0,5This is actually neat
0,14so much that, when they were making DOA5, one of the interviews were like "don't worry, we're downplaying the boob physics"
There is no non-upfront fanservice
oh dear lord
O_O
All fanservice is upfront
PIEH
Night, all.
You cannot be coy about fanservice.
/me dies from laughter
It's there or it isn't.

If itagaki was still there it would be different

she also has ridiculously long legs

It's also a lot harder than it first appears

00,02RAWRity, cleverbot is jensen

Bayonetta's weird, though. In a lot of ways it objectifies women, but in others it empowers them.
For a second, I thought we're crossing over to Transformers territory.

Well then you're just one unlucky bastard. Sorry.
And the CPU hates you
exactly
ask Savage about my luck
I hate The Amazing Spiderman without even having seen it on nerdrage principles.
Well, good night all you comic-talking ponies.
I'm gonna become a Wrecker like in Phantasy Star 2
You just need to give it the same hate back
His appearance in that movie = no Spiderman in the Avengers 2.
;_;
Well, half of the Superman movies have been good.
is the stream done for good?
maybe
maybe not
but yeah
Lol :P
The allied CPUS always, ALWAYS do stupid things
Ask RX about my luck with packs in ME3
I havent been in here all day... busy day today o_o
You get plenty of rares and ultra rares, just not the very specific ones you want.
RARity in the comics hes a wisecracker anyway. Hes also semi arrogant and cocky
I've only had 5 hours of sleep :D
no characters
thats spidermans charm ;p
and X-men is, sadly, owned by Fox
oops meant 3
not a single goddamn one
for a week
and the chances of them are equal to getting any other rare
but it's the POOL it's drawing from RX
just because.
and yet still no characters
Oh...my bad.
At least once, I told all my allied units to huddle in the back while my controlled units wrecked everything.
They've already lost a lot of merchandising rights to Spiderman.

00,03Night y'all!
you know RX, you should record one of our sessions once
I have nothing to record with >____>
dammit
too bad Unfound doesn't want to play anymore
he probably has a capture card
He can just get drunk and slap Thanos like he's his wife...
xD
xD
on*
<_<
okay
OKAY
brb
that is ofc if everything is maxed out
I have it, but I am busy torrenting shit
i would play but i have to reinstall everything in my laptop
Same here
I actually only have 8 things left to unlock
f
Yuck. xD
I refuse to play ME3 until everyone stops whining about it.
...
i'm boooooooored i want to play something....
ooh! I know!
I think the film needs him to be truly successful. Part of the reason the Avengers rocked was that he played well with the other characters.
Bleh
They are already here.
back
They're gonna have a hard time matching that charisma on-screen.
have you seen the front page of BSN multiplayer forums?
saying it's overpowered
odooddoododododododoododooddododo
its too light >_>
TBH, I found a lot of Tony's lines in Avengers to be rather forced.
it's not that light
Like a lot of Whedon's "clever" writing, actually
and the Eviscerator is lighter
and the Disciple is lighter
"Eviscerator"
Mhm..
need food
I wouldn't know
A gun named after one of my favourite words
making it heavier would help to keep all weapons viable, instead of having all caster classes take the pihranna
do you want them to pull a Krysae on it?
It made the whole thing crazy fun.
no
I just want it heavier
srry
Hi everypony
not completely
By the way: http://shepherd0821.deviantart.com/gallery/36807902#/d50c92a
if they gave it back its old RoF itd be fine
Eh, it just seems whenever Whedon's trying to write banter, I can always tell the jokes before they come. I can tell when one character's setting up another one for a one-liner, or a speech.
It all just feels like he's TRYING to emulate the banter in other comedic movies, but isn't as good or natural at it.
they could even lower the damage some more if it got its old RoF back
No stream?
it can kill one in about two clips
that made me laugh
...
<_<
>_>
<_<
which happens if you hit them directly when not host
>_>
aluvard?
<_<
alucard?
at least he could speak
I tested it recently too, and with only a krysae 8
And then kickscript.
Needs more stream
well I could try it with my Weapons Soldier
ehh I've had worse results
it needs either a turian soldier, destroyer, or geth
but still, a 40% damage boost and ALL my ammo later and the Brute was still alive with 3 bars of armor
um no
because it was firing duds
WeLoveFine is now selling pony iPod shtuff
All the same, I just....don't see how the JLA movie can come together, realistically.
at best
Marksmen needs a buff
All this ME3 nerding
spayed
it either needs to refill ammo
that is the importantce here
It feels like Whedon's always having his characters do that.
THAT'S IT!
turian soldier does need a buff
Saturn, start streaming and tell us the Brick joke again
you don't need to reload during the duration of Marksman
turians need to be able to dodge for one
just increase the cooldown for balance
Okay. Okay. I don't want to post too many of these...but this one is just hilarious. http://shepherd0821.deviantart.com/gallery/36807902#/d50ps51
that would help give him a role separate from the destroyer
happened several times, she eventually was confined to a cat run I built for her.
oh gosh nooo
window boxes, long spaces, ramps, etc.
he needs a dodge
she was good for a year and a half.
Waht
probably just me though
probably
Yup just you
all the 4 chan you had earlier was 403 for me
rarity
If it's been 1.5 years since the last episode, maybe she's calmed down.

Magicka is popping to my mind.
i generally dont care about the plot
magicka was amazing
It was.
If it's fun, why not?
Last DLC they released though..horrible
favourite thing
PLOT
They released some decent DLC for it, but their last one was just pathetic.
http://theadmin.co.uk/img/xW0m3J.png anyone any good at design
I heard you like dirt.
yup, trying to make a house using dirt as the primary construction medium
Needs moar dirt.
yeah, thats just the entrance hall atm
Interesting. Keep it up.

One thing about Magicka is I wish they would fix multiplayer. Still too many bugs/glitches.
00,02Flyboy, i saw that during the sales but decided not to get it
00,02it looks like i went the wrong way

08,01with a *passion*
oh FOR FU- i still cand get the word right...
Saturn: -.-
08,01<3
:D
from saturn, with <3
Saturn: Hiya
<3
08,01so i've decided on a bass guitar
08,01i'm getting a Washburn AB10
08,01and i'm selling most of my instruments to pay for it
08,01clarinet, darbuka, french horn, one of my keyboards, possibly one or two mics
Damn that's quite abit for one guitar Saturn.
08,01Jmo4267: the guitar costs nearly £400
00,02Flyboy, ikr
Fair enough. Hope it is worth it in the end :)
00,02Saturn, if you hate gardening why were you doing it in the first place?
08,01if i don't sell the mics, i can probably get about £150 - £200
08,01Phase4: because the garden is overgrown
/me 08,01has a biiiig garden
00,02fair enough
00,02>big garden
00,02>does not like gardening
^
08,01this guitar is £375 or $385
don't buy them in £ then
I can't see the logic in that. 6_9
08,01$385 is roughly £300
buffer
08,01probably just under
it's always like this
08,01but earn money in £
Saturn : why can't you?
well you can change at every bank
08,01if i order in $, that means it's coming from America
Saturn: you sure? isn't 300£ like 700$?
Eh
08,01Eli: it's way less than that now
08,01£300 = $472.46
Shame, since you can easily convert currency on paypal
08,01according to xe.com

Sigh good ol' Charmander, clearly he was the best starter

Stupid stream stop freezing
Rofl.
I think it is named Ponyta to serve as a loophole.
I can see that turning out well...
The stream keeps freezing.
supposedly the system supports up to 4 normal players and 2 tablets at the same time
I only was able to verify 4 players + 1 tablet
Wow, Viridian City already?
You can't trap people indefinitely
/me watches Rain slink in
Damn it.
My plans ruined.
Dam it
My brother and I... tried that
'tried'
I still was able to beat the first level
it took a few tries and a significant amount of time
but I got past the barricades
They also had a competition for which "team" could beat the first level the fastest
THE BARRELS ARE MAKING IT BUFFER!
and my brother and I won
:O
http://www.vgcats.com/super/images/091202.gif

Drama, drama everywhere

Saturn: Hey, I like one of Cher's songs.
Just ONE
/me don his opera cape
08,01AttacktheAndalite: OUT! NOW! 1 MILLION YEARS DUNGEON!

03 alrighty, I hope you enjoyed
/me is locked in le dungeon

Thank you slurry. :)
03 wait
03 No, I'm going to continue streaming
08,01SlurryMoon: you go, girl! <3
Alrighty.
03 now, let's see
Hey Saturn, can I pretend I don't like Cher? :3
am i getting banned?
08,01AttacktheAndalite: but i'll still know you do like Cher
not if you stop bringing it up
Unfortunately I cannot watch the stream. :i
/me blushes
08,01unless i pretend as well
08,01we both know i like men
08,01but neither of us are willing to admit it
6_9
oh boy
Allo everypony.
...?
too spooky
Oh sheet.
and buffer -.-
08,01AttacktheAndalite: meh, i guess
Oh dammit, it's daytime here. :/
Yaaaaay *bows at Saturn's feet*
Only 100 years dungeon?
08,01or go on about "Cher pride"
Hallo everypony :)
*morn
08,01Meanwhile: you know The Sundering?
Cher is a singer...I think.
08,01she caused that.
The...no.
Hey there Focus and laking
yes
But you keep rubbing yours in our face.
Saturn: I don't like to rub my lifestyle choice in anyone's face, actually. I just say "I like x" and let it go there.
08,01of all the people you'd expect to make a WoW joke, i think i was probably the last one, no?
I heard it was good but I have yet to play it.
whats with the stream are you guys getting it to?
yes
o
08,01i'm just checking
O_______0
08,01in case you do
/me yawns
Who's streaming this?
why do you need to collect the 8 pages?
Saturn: Not seeing the relevance of whatever a Cher is, but ok.
and eat some pie
08,01AttacktheAndalite: <3
win
i like pie

08,01Meanwhile: Cher is a "singer"
The buffering is killing it for me :(
yeah that buffer kills the suspense
Hmm, how long is it?
:O
Is it scarier than Amnesia?
It's not even working for me!
Awwww
Well, it is
Nevertheless, I shall check it out
^
refreshed stream
not with all this buffering I won't. -_-
Refreshing doesn't help
08,01meh, computer games
i got to 6 pages...never played it again
Saturn, do you has ps3?
08,01i remember when everyone just played chess and was done with it
Com-pew-tar
Oh!
:D
I saw that movie Cher was in with Wynona Ryder. It's okay...
buffer.
Saturn: You had chess? Why I had to play Go, up hill, both ways!
No
/me observes screen carefully
08,01indeed
slener:O
/me poops his pants in supence
Turn around for fun times!
08,01Unnr|Laptop: but we only had one set pieces *between* both sides
Saturn, y u "meh computer games" when u no has console that I can play with you on
08,01Rain: i don't play computer games
08,01Rain: i don't find them fun
they*
Saturn: Do you play WoW on a microwave?
then why you no has console I can play with you on, Saturn? :3
08,01Meanwhile: i was about to mention that WoW is an exception
Microwave games are the best
WoW has a way of making you forget everything else.
Byzantine chess is alot of fun to play
08,01though, I find my interest in it waning
Queens hop, medieval style
I never got the appeal about WoW, not even when it came out.
I play games on a fried boot...
Saturn: Snirk
08,01Meanwhile: it's not that. it's the actual playing of it i find boring.
08,01it's just grind grind grind, really
OK.....brb......hope to be back for Euro Movie Night
he could have desktpo ponies
Pandaland is out Sep 25
oh dear giid
08,01maybe i'm just not focused enough on it to appreciate it
maybe he should fix the stream
Wait nvm it's fine now
Saturn: How're you playing it?
ded?
darn
ded
...
He ded
08,01i guess my play style has changed... i used to be really into the RP side and giving my character a backstory, adding to it as i levelled up
No.
if you look at him too long, you loose
no I didn't
08,01now it's just about numbers for me
It lagged too much
The stream came back on after you had died.
The stream keeps blockin out
tickle me buffer
very staticy
buffermonster got me
08,01Meanwhile: Terenas
We heard static and nothing else
08,01alliance side
I can hear you
08,01come find me; my character's name is Titnuzl
No.
we hear you
It was just static before
Dat slurry voice :3
We couldn't hear anything.
08,01i called her Bumteez
Staticy hello
08,01or Bumtees, actually
he is probablyy using on of those old radio stations for his stream
We can hear you, but *buffer*
...kind of it cutting off a bit
Saturn: Youre Alliance? eew ;)
There's still a buffer.
/me 08,01is surprised that his characters haven't been reported for dodgy names yet
Saturn: I used to raid with a druid called Cunningstunt. You'll be fine.
...of the side...all I could re....ly af....ford.
:D
^
08,01Titnuzl is level 61 gnomish rogue
derp a derp
Alrighty then- *buffer*
08,01she has an eyepatch!
08,01Eli: Terenas
the buffermonster still beckons
Saturn: of course she does
"Excuse me." *buffer*
Eeeeh, stop talking about WoW, you're motivating me to reactivate my subscription.
o_O
MURDER SPREE
Can't wait for movies. I missed it yesterday cuz I was watching the olympics.
Any female mods here? I am hoping to hear a chick stream their voice.
Didn't hear me during the who- -sle- *buffer*
they mentioned 'harmony' and 'discord' in the same sentence
I'll be back for movie night. Laters! :)
The screaming was implied.
The opening of the Olympics was amazing.
Trixie*
Fix the stream, then play it again.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA THIS BUFFER
It's infuriating!
the stream is just off
Oh ok then. :)
Mfw people can't tell the difference between buffering and absent.
What's the lottery results?
Absent is ultimate buffer
I'm back! :$ whose desktop is this?
the buffermonstersdesktop
also, the stream is off
its not buffering
it is just showing the last image that it had on it
Liokin_:Disregard fear, acquire squid ink

Sometimes, I guess the only thing that might work against mindless ridicule is a change of subject. But that's still censorship, and it would be wrong of me.
