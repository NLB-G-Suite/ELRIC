Torchlight is amazing
And a sequel would be fab
I WANT BORDERLANDS 2.

Y7eah
guys, have you noticed, valve cant count to 3?
that'll prolong replayability
I'm guessing that wreks streaming
Yeah
I realised years ago
Episode 3 anyone?
never happen
they cant count to 3
unless
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lLHy5xv3v8&feature=related
Valve never put a three in any of there games
its one of there motto's
speaking of TF2
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lLHy5xv3v8&feature=related
:/
05im not talented
05its called practice
05you get nowhere iwth out it and dedication
You're gooood
The onyl part of Wrek's talent I can muster is his Sniper skills in TF2
anyone know any speed stacking?
I've seen it once
I can speed stack pancakes

i just unlocked the M1014 on there
I've seen people running around like madmen in BF3 with their rocketlaunchers
that does it. next paycheck, I'm getting me a drawing tablet, and some instructional books
Eh, Battlefield look aight
crafter
that explains it
HOW DOES A BRAIN WORK THAT WAY?
i have no clue
i went 12-0 with only air-to-air clues
man i missed the jets
and drawiing a pony
neat
poneh
Matilda!
Derpy is all i need @_@
Derpy and Dash
and pinkie
when did they bring back the F-35?
yes?
in the addon
back to karkand
BOOOO
but it's crap. the maneuverabilty and speed in dogfights is a joke. even it's bullets are slower that the mig's
05who is this?
I know, but I'm not a chatter though...
i thought there was no difference?
Looks like Matilda to me
its rainbow dash
there's a huge difference
its Dasheh
It's flutterhsy
not fluttershy
Its a pony.
mhmm
my hunch is Rarity
I'm totally sure its a pony.
RD?
rarity,twi,or dash
It's Twilight
i've narrowed it down to those 3
dash
twilight
Wait
unless a background pony
It MIGHT be Twixier

lol derpy day
granted i can't play on high either, but i don't really care. 64 players and all
no,it replaces them with jets
now they aren't
unfound their not even CLOSE to hard
if they're hard to fly, you have the wrong mosue senitivity
tweak that and everythings cool
no mouse sensitivity
mine was 14
no idea. i'm an occasional pilot
Brb, gonna check if my pancakes are ready for creation yet
then i kiled 4 helis and boosted it up to 18
but my win ratio in jets was 3:1
: )
wish i could get any BF.
i got most of my practice on BF play4free
like BFBC2
does it have aircraft?
you ever play Battlefield Play4Free?
no
BFBC2 at least not
Play4Free is basically Bad Company 2
I'm off for a while, gonna do some more Assassin's Creed
ttfn
cya
Ooh a LoL update! :))
lol
lol @ LoL
but if you want an actual battlefield, i advise you to get something that's not bad company
FFS.
Battlefield 2
all bad rotatiobn.
bad company was a lot more action balanced than tactics
brb
ill be back in 5 minutes
cya for now
I'm back
bye
/me rages
that alone took the pacing more into a COD direction
I dunno
o_O
Well...Guess the chats gonna go quiet for a bit.
Not really. :P
Same.
bloody*
Most Brits use damn, because they are corrupted by America
Derpy approves
They would be more familiar with "Bloody"
SONG NAME
I use it when it makes sense

Don't kill me for this, but for some reason, this picture strikes as suggestive. O_e
sorry if i took awhile,i made a sandwhich.
ofna01's here everyone hide :p
suggestive is not uncommon for wreks pictures
/me hides
/me noms sandwhich and looks around
where is everyone?
here
/me is trying not to laugh
/me hops out "Surprise!"
I like suggestive, it makes me realize how horrible I am.
/me chokes on sandwhich
I'm not bothered, but I felt like I had to say it.
Think I overdid it?
Rarity needs a last name... Or a signature with 2 letters.
No, but nothing scares me really
/me is still choking
/me poking ofna with a stick
/me takes stick and breaks it,still choking
The only thing that scares me, is something that scares everyone
Less stick poking more heimlich manevuer
No.
Taxes?
Think about a certain kid singer.
You are afraid of fridays?
Breath darn it
ohh
/me spits sandwhich chunk in aircrafters face
oops
Thursday is boring
thursday came after wednesday
/me throws it back down Ofna01's throat-
Why?
Since I won't be going to my friends for a while
/me isnt choking anymore

Oh, yeah, we do a LOT of maintenance and avionic upgrades
pic page 2? yeah
recently completed modifications on the aircraft's nozzle bay doors to eliminate cracking.
thats a damn F-22
O_O
most high-tech plane on earth
One of the most expensive fighters
http://www.hill.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/thumbnails160/051207-F-2673Z-110.jpg
that F-16 seems a little weird..
the angle of the bend of the elevators
seems a little lower then normal F-16's
We have F-16's and JAS Gripens at our airbase
Jim,check out the pic,see if anything is weird to you
those little "wings are part of the refuel boom
>sees discussion of planes
well,the wings seem like their bent slightly up
SAAB aircraft? neat
yeah. that's the boom
not those,the wings on the plane
oh.
Hi again.
Stabilators
hmm, it doesn't look that strange to me
the actually wings,the ones with flaps and airleons
pitched for climb
guess its just my imagination
hey guys just got back from college
trailing or leading edge of the wing?
well,the whole thing
qwho's streaming
it looks like their slightly bent upwards
boom's plaing trick
its probably just me

dat F-14
my favorite plane
cant believe the last deployment was 2006
hey everypony
The F-35's electronic warfare systems are intended to detect hostile aircraft first, which can then be scanned with the electro-optical system and action taken to engage or evade the opponent before the F-35 is detected.[198] The CATbird avionics testbed for the F-35 program has proved capable of detecting and jamming F-22 radars.[204]
Crap!
when is the F-35 supposed to go into service?
I think I have a stomach flu:(
arent they still developing it?
F-35 can JAM the F-22 radar

but furries are bad
when they send me those pics
brony>furry
i..am disturbed..
^
Srsly.
not really
Its disturbing imagery
furries arent bad
This is true.....ponies are animals.... but
Ponies- hairy creatures
Meh, idk
furry=anthro
Humans are animals
though i guess it really comes down to how you define "furry"
^
similarly, how would you define "brony" when defending it
some people think "brony" refers to R34 and the like
Someone not in the correct target audience for a show.
ya
furry artists draw anthro
and are sex obedient..
Yes the book
All my friends like CoD, and sometimes, I just want to spear them all
wait, no. that's zoophilia. not furry

That's personification? no?

YOU MADE FLUTTERSHY CRY
:(
fluttershy why are soo adorable!!!!?!?!??!?!
I know, and I feel bad about it too
Sad Shy :'(
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2472/
Beg pardon, what's that?
no offense, but did you mean bronytis?
because the fic I have in mind is a sad one, and I want it accompanied by something I've drawn. Fluttershy probably won't be one crying, but she was the first one that came to mind
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2179/
fucking hicups
/me points and laughs
worth it
that means I need an inhalers
MLD was boring.
i had that then i had pnumonia than i had mono
no
no
no
no
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NO
no
NO
dat spam
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyup.
eh... MLD did nothing for me. it felt like the author was trying too hard to make me cry
goddammittabkey
Dat daseball.
05hmm
dat tab fail
I have yet to read MLD, tomorrow i shall :)
Wait, I just broke that combo? I win!
:o
/me 's head jammed
I found "Simply Rarity" a lot sadder
...Wrek...you okay?
Okay I shed a tear or two to it but that's it. I wasn't bawling my eyes out
05im ok but
o.o
05dunno if i am to continue on this one
Hmm
Hmmm
oops
mhm
^
why did i get kicked?
spam ?
^
:\
and damn thats a good drawing
But MLD is not boring
imo
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1347/
It is.
It dragged on
:)
Thus, there is no definitive answer.
I would agree Simply Rarity is superior to MLD
MLD is a Good Sad fic but it's far from beign something truly great
FRICK
everypony died
it was a disaster
05how about some music and perhaps even some gaming for a while?
How is simply rarity?
MLD seems too contrived at times to me, which takes me out of the story. It's hard to elaborate on that though without spoilers
YA
do eeeeeeet
Whatchya gonna play?
