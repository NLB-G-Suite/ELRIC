TheDocter: nah, theyre cheaper whereever thir made
Yeah
the Hub's ratings will go through the roof the moment it stops being a premium channel
I wish we had the hub here in England :(
yeah
Kammerjunk: that means I can get better games that people don't like cheaper :D
who cares about how good shows are just buy the toys
Pokemon probly will be still on in the future!
:D
MadSurge: Yay!
but i think its better to watch the hub online, with other brony's :)
Ill be dead watching it!
Flyboy - oh, i agree
Kammerjunk: like Shadows of the Damned :D
that's why my TV and computer monitor are right beside each other
agreed
i got DVR just in time to have it record A Canterlot Wedding ^_^
Or invite bronies over and have a TV party!
AND every episode of Legend of Korra

FairysHuff: good to see im not the only one
i miss tv shows with story
thats why i love MLP
Why is the only good shows not even on anymore?
Note- I've never played a Cod game and never will. I hate modern day shooters
video games suck storywise now to
Okay guys, I'm going outside for a bit. See you later! :)
MLP has yet to release season 3 and Legend of Korra has yet to release book 2 :( I'm sad now

TheDoctor: looking at you skyrim
MirrorImage: I got sunglasses! B)
there's some good games out there, though
TheDoctor: thats why i only play valve games
I absolutely loved Amnesia :3
TheDoctor: I don't know what you're talking about. Minecraft had a great storyline.
Bronysith - yes... valve games...
Bronysith: Skyrim doesn't count, it's a Bethesda game.
awwwww yea valve is awesome
Disregard Story, Acquire $100 digital ring
minecraftnis fun but has no plot
yea
sorry on my kindle fire
Some how when I got. On YouTube I was a ponies to sonic to crappy animations to .... Justin beiber
speaking of Minecraft, v1.3 is due out in the next couple of weeks evidently
:D
You know what had a great storyline?
Persona 4.
Yuck
oyea
My YT days were uh.... mixed lol
never played
Insane: It just flows together.
lol so true skyrim has the same basic plot as the last game
1. Show Walt Disney what is aired on Disney Channel. 2. Disney is now spinning in his grave. 3. Dig him up, attach him to a generator. 4. Infinite energy.
Sonic is awesome
5.????? 6. Profit
Brotip: Add magnets for more infinite energy
Jim: GENIUS! :O
my little pony mmorpg makenit
Jim: problem economy?
I heard Sonic is getting back up again
Hi, everypony!
But yeah, you literally can not have a flawless Bethesda games.
hi drpony
drpony: Salve!
nope sonic is now marios sex slave
VALVE is best gaming company
Whys there so much sonic gore?
XD
Kammerjunk - that's because they use us as cheap bug detection
Poor sonia
* sonic
Actually, the new games I've seen is actually pretty good.
and they know that some people will be irritated enough to write a mod to fix it themselves
welp. time for Gmod

You know the rocket radio tower segment?
Jim: I'll grab my suit
Is having a level 48 typhlosion at that point overkill?
I'll get the firecrackers, you'll get the gasoline
what do i do
SpadeMagnes[R]: idk i dont remember, check pokemon enemy levels on a walkthrough
My typlhosion has high special attack and attack levels
/me goes shopping for gasoline
So it pretty much one shots with Flamethrower
:$:'(
SpadeMagnes[R]: well i remember 1-shotting enemies as well, but i actually had some trouble with one of the bosses iirc
Also I feel stupid I used to think the lake of rage gyarados was special
He's red
so i herd u gais liek d'aww
http://derpy.me/ome2g
But whats the point of a shiny if everyone can get it?
It's called "Gift"
Kammerjunk, Right in the diabeethus
Its just there, the other shineys actually mean something when you get one
:);):D:P:S:$:O:|:'(:S:[6_9
SPAM ALL THE EMOTICONS THINGYS
SpadeMagnes[R]: to illustrate the existence of shinies, maybe? its still cool to have a red gyarados either way
SpadeMagnes[R]: It's an easter egg sorta secret. Nowaday shinies are just getting lucky.
Also Why the hell did they replces the slots with the retarded voltorb flip?
spam all the things and get all the kicks
what's the english adjective for being unfailable...like the pope or god or something who can't be wrong by definition
spam all the things and get all the kicks
?
TheDoctor: Please don't spam.
I've never found a shiny pokemon
Derpy_at_work: Infallible?
I have a shiny groudon
sorry
SpadeMagnes[R]: for something new maybe, idk
thanks

I have a shiny buttcheek

Does anyone watch Chuggaconroy?
SpadeMagnes[R]: ive watched some of his vids
Back in the original Gold I used the clone exploit and made a red gyarados team. Go figure.
What's different with a shiny? Is it only the colour?
Yes
Yep
Jim: As far as I can tell, yes.
Chugga's shiny was insane
gah... i just had a bit of an asthma attack and took my inhaler and now i feel like realllllyyy jittery
Which is really really /really/ lame.
It was: A the pokemon he wanted

In elf's world!"
Apperently the makers got a cease and disist from SEGA
They existed everywhere.
Cease and disist is just a formal way to say "Stop dat shiet"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEd6s5S4hJI Check this out
Hey

Howdy brony_swan.
Meanwhile u wub me?
Eenope.

You know what I find is the silliest court case?
hey brony_swan :)
The most retarded case ever
That is pretty silly.
SpadeMagnes[R]: I was just going to say how silly that sounds.
Meanwhile: u wub me moar than Trixe?
Yes but that's not that interesting because I love being kicked in the shins more than Trixie.
SpadeMagnes[R]: =_(\
omc.. im getting so tired.
MegaMoonShine: this is legit by the way
1. it doesn't 2. so a ghost looks kinda like a ghost ........ihave no words

CCCP: who is that
CCCP: It's so nice to see you again!
CCCP: O_o.
sprinkle_GS17: Samus Aran
my inhaler is going to make me have a heart attack one day..
Is it wrong for me to think alot of ANY fanbase is mentaly retarded in how they act?
Deleted_dreams: You too! :D
Everlasting_Joy: :P
SpadeMagnes[R]: No, not really.
SpadeMagnes[R]: Nope, because a lot of the time they do.
Sonic for example
Welp
TIme to derp around on youtube
i need to run...
CCCP: So how's your life been?
mehh
SpadeMagnes[R]: Prime example right there.
They want new shit
Sega does so, they still whine
What the fuck do you want fanboys?!
Sonic as a franchise really needs to die.
Deleted_dreams: okay i guess nothing really happend, you?
Meanwhile: Agreed.
I agree Meanwhile
I had to change my socks just a bit ago
stop these flame wars both nintendo and sega are good >.>
CCCP: I'm learning to play the Cello
Hey! Generations was good
Sonic is actually making good games
Deleted_dreams: really? thats awesome do you like it?
Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 were good
Deleted_dreams, Cellos are so awesome :3
CCCP: it's harder to play than my violin and you have to hold it up... but it's pretty awesome!
Jim: AGREED!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H1JTB6eHiI&list=PL297445C6A3381D39&index=1&feature=plpp_video
And yet mario does the same shit every game and no one gives a crap
Deleted_dreams :3
Deleted_dreams: I might be biased since I played violin first, but cello seems easier to just pick up and play
SpadeMagnes[R]: Then again, his leap to 3D was actually good.
CCCP: :33
Hey, SA1 was good
Deleted_dreams: its like Octavia
why do people start flame warson every single game they play? god its getting annoying
SpadeMagnes[R]: I give a crap, I think Mario should die as well.
Meanwhile: well you hate everything so...thats a given
Flame War!
PonyNegZero: Yeah, I agree
I don't hate everything, just a lot of things.
So no flame war for you
sonicandmario85: Progress of fandom.
CCCP: YEAH!!!!
Meanwhile do you hate yourself?
:D
BOTH NINTENDO AND SEGA ARE GOOD PROBLEM SOLVED
Anotherguy: yes.
Now if You'll excuse me I have to clean up dog piss again
sonicandmario85: Nope.
Mother of God
SpadeMagnes[R]: :(, been there, too many times.
Yeah, both nintendo and sega are good, that wasn't the argument
im FREAKIN OUT
Both Nintend and Sega are crummy and should be dissolved in acid.
Nintendo*
god they are just video games that are wasting your life but are fun
I swear my ten year old dog must have bladder infections
CCCP: btw where did you gget those nolan or dolan pics?
sonicandmario85: Depends if you find it a waste of a life.
Played video games all his life, and watches ponies all day. WORTH IT
if you truely enjoy games, they shouldn't seem like a waste of life
sprinkle_GS17: i think so
Jim: Exactly.
Should I go eat or should I stay here to see if something funny happens?
Meanwhile: I do hope you're kidding.
Does anyone remember Bubsy?
Oh damnit! gotta go everyone!! <3
CCCP: ? i asked where you got them?
cya CCCP
you know, i have a feeling that CCCP is a spy.
Anotherguy: Why not both? Stay on here, grab lunch, come back and watch?
Later CCCP!
Everlasting_Joy Oh my god! You are right!
inb4 war starts in the chat http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGjHsLnUO1U
sprinkle_GS17: oh... googlesearch but im not sure wherethe sources were from
:3
CriticKitten: Does this face look like it's kidding? http://derpy.me/sygi4
Out of all the origonal 151 pokemon Electrode is the most unorigonal pokemon ever
Meanwhile: :D
Upside down pokeball... oh wow thats creative
Meanwhile, "Does this look like the face of mercy?"
Meanwhile: Seeing as how Nintendo is the only one of the big three whose status as a video game maker doesn't boil down to a single negative board room meeting, I'm gonna say that "death to Nintendo" is just about the stupidiest sentiment a gamer can announce. >_>
Im dirrrrrtyyyy
i feel like running EVERYWHERE....
all at once.
sorry, didnt mean to kill the chat
so much energy...
CriticKitten: Given that all Nintendo does is release the same series of games every year I'm gonna say that they're just as bad as nearly every other big game company nowadays.
And yet it sells
In case of dwindling money, make old game with a bigger number.
Meanwhile: Even if you don't like their games, their existence is part of the reason gaming is so big nowadays. >_>
Of course it sells, people are stupid.
im gunna go for awhile, back in a few...
hey everypony watch this video :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWGDFGqbyZ8
now just hold on for a sec. It sells =/= people are stupid. It sells = people have different taste than you.
Meanwhile: And their games tend to differ a hell of a lot more between iterations than the typical sequel in any other franchise, with a few noted exceptions where the game was declared to be a direct sequel.
I don't normally eat lunch while on bronystate, but when I do, I do it for you
Anotherguy: :).
CriticKitten: Now that's just rose tinted goggles.
Internet fight
Alchemist: you dont get it. if you have a different opinion from the great and powerful Meanwhile , you are stupid. weve established that before.
Damn right you are.
Uh oh
So having a opinion is wrong?
Yes. Stop that.
:D
The cookie jar refuses to open!
SpadeMagnes[R]: no its ok as long as its the same as Meanwhile , that means your right
you're*
In opinions who is truley right and wrong?
No one really is
Meanwhile: Not hardly. Compare any two non-sequel Mario games to two Call of Duty games and try to tell me the former isn't more differentiated. Just TRY it. You'd have to lie to do so. :p
,((___)),E
...fail on me
CriticKitten: Trying to use "It's less copying than x" is a pretty poor defense.
In opinions there IS no right and there is no wrong
Meanwhile http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWGDFGqbyZ8
SpadeMagnes[R]: well logically speaking there can be only one correct answer to questions. as for like/dislike, that can vary
What is this witchcraft!?
Meanwhile: It's not even copying. There's nothing wrong with reusing a character or setting. >_>
shivers.
Meanwhile: Especially if the character is popular and sells units.
I think xbox pc wii and ps3
Are all great gaming systems
^
in there own type of way
/me shivers and shakes in her seat
/me grows tired of this bickering.
i honestly dont get the fight over consoles, although i dont play games much anymore
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycSJZS5VJIo&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577&index=53&feature=plpp_video
and i dont have any consoles XD
sprinkle_GS17: me ethier
CriticKitten: Right, reuse all the characters for 20 years. Don't even put any effort into creativity when you can just stamp out the same game and still get paid.
Me neither
Oh wait
cow334: I'd like to have an xbox but the buttons are confusing where they are. But then again, it could be that I had a PS1 my childhood
sprinkle_GS17: me neither but I can see the appeal
Meanwhile: Never did understand why Nintendo gets so much shit for "copying over and over", but you look at most other franchises and they're doing (at best) the same damn thing, and at worst they're copying even harder. :P
Meanwhile: Dude what is your problem?
?
Recycling, anyone?
AttacktheAndalite: hmm well the game consels controllers are kinda confuesing but you get the hang of them trust me
Every time stuff like this happens you just sound like a total dick
CriticKitten: I hate every other publisher who does the same thing, nothing special about nintendo.
well actually i do have some portable consoles like psp and ds, but the former is broken and for the latter i only have 1 game
OHMYGOODNESS can we please stop talking soo fast?
No
also guys if you didnt watch the video if you got a bad comment about a game or console keep it to your fucking self no one wants to hear it
MusicalPony: NU TRAIN SPEED OF THOUGHT
....
Meanwhile: Do yourself a favor and get educated. There's at least several other franchises besides Nintendo's big three which do the same damn thing, I don't hear you bitching about them. >_>
So apperently Meanwhile is francis since he seems to hate everything
all consels
are best consels
sprinkle_GS17: wtc?
SpadeMagnes[R]: Dude, if you read what I was writing you'd get my problem, whether or not I come across as a dick is irrelevant.
MusicalPony: haw?
come on people, no need to get personal over this...
MusicalPony Here at bronystate, we get shit done fast
Anotherguy: well its dang fast.
BUT i think we can all agree on somthing
cow334: I guess it takes getting used to, but I can't afford a 360. My sis and I are looking forward to Assassin's Creed 3, even though we've never played any of the games before and my sis hasn't played a game since Mario Bros
CriticKitten: Because they aren't the current topic of discussion.
call of duty is the same sh** over and over again
hey guys
hello OneTrickPony
hey OneTrickPony
TF2 FTW
Meanwhile: No, because they're not Nintendo and because mentioning them doesn't play into your narrative. :p
Howdy OneTrickPony!
Meanwhile: Fox News tactics are worst tactics, dude.
OneTrickPony Hey!
hai OneTrickPony
AttacktheAndalite: hmm well are you thinking about getting any game systems at the moment?
wait... is fox news classified as NEWS?
no
Jim: no
hai cow334, AttacktheAndalite, Everlasting_Joy, Anotherguy, and Jim
When the hell did fox ever have accurate news?
hey guys do you miss the classic mario and sonic games if your a fan of them? well you can play them again because theres emulators on the computer you can download and you download one of those classic game roms and play it and you will be playing it on the pc :D
cow334: im not interested in any of them, except maybe pspvita, but only 1 game is interesting for me
CriticKitten: That and the fact that they aren't relevant until you've brought them up. Call of Duty and Halo are as bad as Mario and Sonic in terms of rehashing the same thing over and over but I don't hear you leaping to their defense.
hello OneTrickPony how are you today
cow334: Maybe a 360 or a PS3 but I'm considering because of the PSN getting hacked last year and the Xbox fanboys...
SpadeMagnes NEVER. Oh hai everypony
Meanwhile: Because they're not "as bad", they're much worse.
Are you still discussing (or whatever) games and stuff?
cow334: very good, how bout you?
I love how people complain about shit being rehashed
sprinkle_GS17: and what game would that be
madcowdisease.
CriticKitten: How, Mario is older than both of those.
I'll be here for 5 minutes
then when they try new shit THEY STLL BITCHS
cow334: tennis :3
*bitch
OneTrickPony: that is awesome to hear my day is going fantastic as well
sprinkle_GS17: lawl'
cow334: But I like customizing shit which means PC....ergh I don't know
Hi Twilight_S!
Make up your god damned minds
/me ... gets popcorn
STOP THIS NONSENSE http://derpy.me/-FPIX
Anotherguy: *hands you a drink*
Meanwhile: I'm pretty sure I already explained how: because Mario tells to actually differentiate between titles. Halo is repeatedly built on an identical engine with some tweaks. >_>
/me tries to not be jittery.
i have a gameboy advance emulator and i can play sonic advance 1 2 and 3 on it :3
AttacktheAndalite Thank you, sir
Is anyone else here a WGI or DCI fan? i feel so alone D:
/me dissapears again
Alchemist: Yep
Anotherguy: You're welcome. And it's ma'am
AttacktheAndalite: hmm well that is wy the invented the mute button you can mute the players to make it where you can not hear them
To the first pony to pm me a youtube video of a song will have me listen to it on repeat until the end of my workday, or until the stream kicks up
SpadeMagnes[R]: lawl
AttacktheAndalite Heh, how funny
ITS A ME
mario here agian for the THOUSAND TIME
cow334: Yeah but I'd probably just play with my boyfriend and his friends. I'm a level-headed person but if I hear a 9 year old playing AC and cursing like a sailor, shit's gonna happen
Meanwhile: If you can pick up a copy of Mario Sunshine and call it identical to Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy, you're just lying to yourself. But comparing Halo 1 to Halo 3 to Reach is pretty easy, since they use the same engine (and the evidence of this is that Reach didn't even think to disable control of alien tech that they should have no clue how to use).
SpadeMagnes[R]: he jumps on goombas too xD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIyAImqy5HQ&list=PL9FB1A5DC948DD70B&index=8&feature=plpp_video Needs more team plasma
AttacktheAndalite: I know what you mean I hate people who just cuss on the mic as well and it is hard to not tell them something back
i <3 Halo...
me to
Mute?
Meanwhile: To the contrary, there's nothing wrong with reusing a setting if they keep changing the formula.
I love halo
/me hides to be away from arguments above
Anotherguy: ...? what
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1556/
I just love the annoying 8 year olds who think they're pro
halo is my main game.
Holla everypony! :)
MusicalPony: halo 4 /)
now i wanna get on my N64 emulator and play paper mario 64 XD
SpadeMagnes[R]: I KNOW RIGHT?!
Meanwhile: Especially if people like the characters and want to keep playing games with them in it.
hello GilDash
Mute the sound so you can't hear people cussing cow334
Halo sucks.
CriticKitten: They don't /keep/ changing the formula though, that's the point. Platformer here, platformer there, oh but now he has a hose. Big whoop.
cow334: oh heck yes! /)
Renard: whys that?
SpadeMagnes[R]: I don't understand - I blew off that 8 year old's face... How is he still talking?
Meanwhile: So what, you want them to constantly change GENRE too?
/me burp
CriticKitten: So if it has fanboys it should be left alone, sounds legit.
cow334: I've seen videos of people trolling little kids. I lol but if that were me, I'd be having some clorful words that's uncouth for a lady
MusicalPony: YES awesome man /)(\
brb
CriticKitten: I want them to make something that they haven't already made.
cow334: im soooo excited! :3
darn
Meanwhile: So your core argument is that Halo 2 should be like Halo 1, except as a third person platformer
Yeah, sounds like a great argument
BACKFLIP
CriticKitten: Great, you can't understand what I'm saying, that's going to make my job easier.
BUT DAD THAT WAS A FRONTFLIP!
I DON'T CARE
I DONT CAREEEE!
Anotherguy: Yes you go to there gamertag or psn name and press the a button and it will mute there name so you cant hear them until you want to un mute them you never new that?
IT WAS A BARRELROLL
stop arguing over a game.
Halo was originally going to be a third person shooter... once upon a time.
Meanwhile: That's literally what you just said. :P
honestly, who gives a crap?
AttacktheAndalite: I troll kids all the time it is awesomke when they get mad
CriticKitten: I want them to not make Halo 2 and make something else.
MusicalPony: apparently they do
sonicandmario85: I DON'T CAAAAAAAA-
MusicalPony: me to man IT IS GOING TO BE AWESOME
awesome
PonyNegZero: its dumb.
Meanwhile: You said that Mario games keep being platformers, therefore all the same. So you'd only accept a new Mario if it wasn't a platformer and used totally different everything? :p
cow334: I KNOW!!!! im saving up JUST for that game, nothing else.
MusicalPony: welcome to the world, there is a lot of dumb out there...
Meanwhile: So you're the epitome of unpleasable fanbase.
Son:Why Eat Water Melon When We Can Hump It? :3
Meanwhile: Everything has to be brand new or it sucks.
GilDash: yes on the pc version it was but they changed it for the xbox versuib
HI
version
PonyNegZero: ughh i know. thats why i stay with band kids.. no drama :D
Can we please steam something?
There's no orginality anymore anyway...
cow334: This. I need to troll. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiLfz6HfCfM
CriticKitten: Fun fact, if it's the same character in a different setting it's still rehashed.
cow334: go to youtube, pick a random game video, make a belittling comment and compare the game to the awesomeness of any COD game and watch thousands of panties get twisted in a few hours.
This argument is getting dull
MusicalPony: me to man me to
Meanwhile: Fun fact, no one cares. :P
All right. I'm going to go eat. Talk to y'all later!
cow334: Yeah, but I meant like pre-alpha sort of thing.
God damn it meanwhile, you are making it hard for me to love and tolerate you
MusicalPony: this is the time when I actually get a bit of coding done since it is easy enough to ignore
Meanwhile: The investors don't care, the players don't care, the game makers don't care.
CriticKitten: Seems I've rustled your jimmies.
Alchemist: lawl i will try that
cow334: YAY! haha
/me nuzzles BaconMane.
Meanwhile: They keep making them, people keep buying them, and there's nothing wrong with it. :P
Me is back. In black
GilDash: hmm well I never new that
PonyNegZero: coding? haha
GilDash: howdy!
CriticKitten: In your flawed opinion.
Sylandest: Holla, Sylly! :)
MusicalPony: awesome you have xbox live?
MusicalPony: ehh... I'm making money, I'm not arguing
Meanwhile: ... :D
cow334: yessir i does :3
/me hugs GilDash :)
Meanwhile: It's sweet that you think you can get to me, but I deal with kids worse than you on a daily basis.
PonyNegZero: ahh.. yay
0,5>.> hi
MusicalPony: want to one v one me on halo some time?
GilDash: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hello BaconMane
Nothing is more satisfying then pounding the kids who think their pros into the dirt
Can't tell if trolling or serious now.
MusicalPony: Holla! :)
Meanwhile: I'm just pointing out that your opinion makes absolutely no sense in the context of gaming.
thank god a mod :)
BaconMane BACON! Hi
cow334: sure when i get my xbox back!
One kid tried to get other players to gang up on me
hi BaconMane
GilDash: ive missed you!
MusicalPony: awesome
CriticKitten: Don't try and paint this as my fault, you engaged me in this dialogue and you're getting wound up about it.
It didnt work out for him
MusicalPony: Have you now? :)
Meanwhile: Would it kill you to not sound so negative all the time?
Meanwhile: You're saying "everything has to be original", but if people *want* more of the same, they should *get* more of the same.
MusicalPony: it is almost funny to watch...
cow334: search me up.. my names SoullessHealer.
0,5Hows it hangin
GilDash: yes!
BaconMane: awesome
We bored
PonyNegZero: a bit yea.. just over video games.
Meanwhile: I'm not wound up. You just wish. :P
/me hugs MusicalPony.
GilDash Hi I didn't see you coming
/me hugs GilDash
Anotherguy: I say we just watch it all unfurl.
MusicalPony: okay when i get the chance I will send me a invite as well my gamer tag is cow224
MusicalPony: this is almost as funny as watching sports fanatics argue
Anotherguy: In that case, here's a special "Holla" just for you. :)
kk cow334
CriticKitten: I believe that making nothing but the same thing causes it to stagnate, if you're content to do nothing but play the same games every year forever then you have fun, but I want to see the platform grow.
Meanwhile: I'm simply pointing out that your opinion is a) a minority; b) flawed as all hell.
MusicalPony: k
AttacktheAndalite That's kind of boring
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzOmdFIqB-o&list=PLBD41FD360AFD8B80&index=20&feature=plpp_video
Anotherguy: Yeah....we need a wrestling mat or something and mud fights
I am watching CriticKitten and Meanwhile go at it
GilDash I'm flattered or however that is spelled
lawl
Celestia damn it shut up
This chat needs more Discord.
CriticKitten: And now that you're just grasping at straws in an attempt to bug me, I'm stopping this.
Meanwhile: I didn't say nothing should be original, now you're just making things up, silly filly.
AttacktheAndalite Now we are talking
So what's everyone else doing?
Anotherguy: I dunno. Haven't got a spell check on this chat. :D
PonyNegZero: i hate sports fans... i hate sports really. haha
,((__)),e
MusicalPony: sports are meant to be played - only watched to become a better athelete
This stream needs more Mario & Luigi
GilDash Not too many grammar nazis here
Anotherguy: No, but I know a few... D:
:D
Anotherguy: mud fights, jello fights and see who can knock each other into quicksand first with a poisonous snake
PonyNegZero: yesyes. thank you.
Meanwhile: I'm saying that you're bitching about something that's, at its core, stupid. There's nothing wrong with making more games in a franchise so long as they can continue to provide a good experience. If you don't like that, tough. :p
AttacktheAndalite Snakes....why did it have to be snakes
MusicalPony: I watched some volleyball since I played it - the positioning and everything was very helpful for my game
Meanwhile: 'cuz as long as they sell, they'll keep being made.
GilDash Noo :O
O HAI :p
Anotherguy: Would you rather it be giant Japanese hornets
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBbibpU8bl8&feature=BFa&list=PLBD41FD360AFD8B80
hey fellow bronies im trying to get more ponies to listen to my debut song beneath the cracks, its a discord song. so if u r interested go on YOUTUBE and search TheNebulaBrony
Anotherguy: Eh, just ignore them. They'll get bored eventually. :)
AttacktheAndalite: Yes
PonyNegZero: thats awesome :] ive watched drum corps live on youtube and in person to help figure out technique and whatnot :P
Rest of Chat: Why does everyone get so shook up when two people engage in a discussion? XD
GilDash They never bored
um... HI?
:p
brony1234: You were kicked yesterday for advertising in chat, you are just as unwelcome now as you were then.
Rest of Chat: No one said you couldn't join in, ya dorks.
CriticKitten: well, its just a dumb argument. we dont wanna get involved.
I got an idea!
CriticKitten: That's okay. You two throw the fire whilst I hide in this bunker over hear. :D
Ahem...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB0PtsEMOrA&feature=relmfu Go Black and White Gym leader music
CriticKitten: I'd join in but I'd lose withing the first 30 seconds
GilDash: here*
MusicalPony: But whining about it isn't productive, it's just annoying. :P
DROP THE BASS CANNON KICK IT
CriticKitten: you gotta fight your own battles
brony
MusicalPony: well, I went to nationals once, so it seems like it worked - sadly my knees are kinda busted at this point so I can't play anymore. Also, I'm guessing you play a band instrument?
CriticKitten: join in what?
CriticKitten: true..
Meanwhile: That really winds you up, doesn't it? :)
GilDash: What fire? We were just having a discussion. You haven't seen me argue. :P
GilDash: Wrong spelling? No, I just consider it my civic duty to point them out.
PonyNegZero: oh i know.. my first season of marching band i got my knees (in some strange way) a bit jacked up..
/me sets the bass on fire
SpadeMagnes[R] Nooooooo!
CriticKitten: 'Twas a joke. :D
MusicalPony: well, my knees click when I stand up...
Eww
PonyNegZero: oh man.. mine arent THAT bad.. im sorry D:
It's settled, everyone. Next argument has mud pits, a wrestling ring and the arguers have to beat each other with large fish while a swarm of angry Japanese hornets.
cow334: What battle? Maybe one day I should actually argue with someone so y'all know what it looks like. That was just a discussion. :p
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqTXCxq1BVQ&feature=relmfu
Meanwhile: Correct spelling, wrong word. Then again, we're only debating semantics here...
MusicalPony: ehh... I'm okay, I just need to be a little careful
Whats so dangerous about japanese hornets?
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fudge!
CriticKitten: what ever you say
cool story
GilDash: If it's the wrong word then it's spelt wrong. :P
cow334: Usually the easy way to tell is when I start digging up links.
SpadeMagnes[R]: My original idea was poisonous snakes but that's too weak.
God, youtube gets a gold medal
Meanwhile: I'm not getting into a grammar debate. :D
PonyNegZero: ah.. during winter percussion season (winter type of marching band i guess) my knees got a bit worse, but i mean its not bad compared to yours..
Thank you youtube
CriticKitten: so you need to bring up links when you argue
....
Thank you for wasting my life for me
cow334: Also please, don't bother trying to troll. You'd be wasting your time. :p
Grammar Nazi spotted
CriticKitten: never said I was did I?
bronyNebula: no shame, ehh?
bronyNebula: Hey, no advertising in ze chat
http://i.imgur.com/26Vmo.png
cow334: "need to". Um, you do realize that debate involves....evidence, right?
you no nothing of trolling if that is what you thought i was doing
MusicalPony: I won't die, don't worry...
Objection?
cow334: And that you have to "prove" your assertions when arguing your case, right?
To every pony: im continuously looping my marching band show for this year... its awesome ! :D
CriticKitten: I was just making a point
bronyNebula How about you pay me to do that?
PonyNegZero: i would hope not!
CriticKitten: Stop rageing over is brony
cow334: So yeah, I use links because....I know how to argue. :P
bronyNebula you have been warned multiple times, further pissing on the rules will get you banned from chat.
MusicalPony: nifty, I haven't actually recorded anything on my violin... I probably should...
sorry bronies just trying to spread the word
CriticKitten: If you knew how to argure you wouldnt need to bring up links to help you out
I'm trying to spread the Nutella
This stream needs more kerbals
PonyNegZero: i used to play violin, but i realized i just wasnt an orchestra kid.
....
right
bronyNebula: I don't think you're actually that sorry...
Meanwhile: I'd like to point out backseat modding is against the rules, but that would be hypocritical.
cow334: Uh, yeah, so you don't know how to debate, then. XD
MusicalPony: I am, I should probably upload something one day (I took a four year break - the only reason why I picked it back up is for pony music...)
CriticKitten: No cause when I argue I dont do it like a girl son I go straight out
cow334: Proper debate is *always* backed up with evidence, on the web, that would involved citations via links. :P
inb4 another fight, everyone stfu and drink yo prune juice
CriticKitten: i am the WORST persuasive person of ever.
woohoo
HOO RAH
yayy
This chat needs a bot
cow334: Sexist. :p
GilDash: I'm going to point out that there's nothing in the rules that literally says people without @'s can't make people aware of them. Especially during times when none of them seem to be present.
PonyNegZero: well thats awesome! you could be like the human version of Octavia :P
CriticKitten: ....Now you are just rageing son
stop it be fore U get mad
bubbles
LAWL
hey everypony :p
/me throws a pidgey into the chat
I understand it's Monday but really?
Stop the war I got children to take care of!
cow334: Aw, darlin', you don't know what my rage looks like. Again, don't bother trying to troll, you can't
CriticKitten: kk
MusicalPony: well, violin != cello, but I guess it is kinda the same idea (didn't AJ play violin/viola in the finale?)
iits monday monday gonna go to work on monday
CriticKitten: cool story bro
cow334: I agree, it is a cool story.
PonyNegZero: oh yeah.. i remember that! haha i should since AJ is my fave :P
Everybody rages on Mondays.
CriticKitten: yeah but not the part where you get mad
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
cow334: Aw, keep trying. <3
sooo
dead?
Moo ve away from the conversation cow334
cow334: Maybe one day you'll grow up to be a big boy troll
/me rigs the chat to eplode
is this bro trying to troll???
*explode
MusicalPony: Well, I'm an engineer, so I decided to make my acoustic violin electric... it's interesting...
CriticKitten: you acuse me of trolling when I am CLEARLEY NOT YOU FOOL
Anotherguy: is ee what you did there
ded
i cant believe there are ppl on here
6_9
cow334: Umad?
hahahah
It's a funny moment when a failed attempt at trolling makes you reverse trolled.
PPFFFFTTTT
The buffer circle suddenly looks interesting right now
Ofc dead.
PonyNegZero: thats really cool... im into medicine.. no engineering here.
Lolwut?
:'( I AINT EVEN MAD
am i witnessing a flame war here?
It's like, nearly 6PM GMT.
Yes!
CriticKitten: I AINT EVEN MAD
I DONT EVEN KNOW
lawl :P
Everybody, calm down and stay calm and can we act like the civilized bronies that we are?
:'(
cow334: You are so mad.
MusicalPony: there is a lot of engineering in medicine, but that doesn't mean you're part of that kind of stuff... still interesting
lawl
its 10am where im at
cow334: You sure? I can get you some new jimmies if I rustled your last pair.
Exactly.
INTERNET FIGHT!

Scootallo is probably proud of us

TF2 FANS?

Bronysith: sounds like a bit like the changelings?
Maidwhile: "Congrats, you can read quotes." - Maidwhile
Bronysith: they feed on your puny flame war!
YES! I can play as a sylvari in the next GW2 beta. I'd LIKE to be a tree....person. :3
I wonder why there are so little of windigos in fanart.

whos streaming
"Don’t steal, don’t lie, don’t cheat, don’t sell drugs. The government hates competition!" <---- dem words
CriticKitten, Can we play as Asura too?
Jim: Yes.
Are the movies Terminator and Back to the Future going to be played tonight or next week?
Because the entire hearthswarming story thingy was a bit silly and fits strangely into canon, so it tends to be glossed over?
Think I'll play Norn on rellease

Dat title

Malavolent: they EXTEERMINATE you then trash you
Jim: I've watched the animation they showed awhile back of the asura. The way the game's designed, all races run at the same speed, so the charr "run" looks kind of slow, and the asura run fast and very jumpy.

I have the feeling that books play a major role in this world
Alchemist: i pinged ya
yeah i played this game back then when i was a kid i played it on the playstation i guess
is that weed?!
Lawl FlyBoy

That was my first though

chickens
Dat peep hole
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I heard, but I couldnt see what you wrote, my chat derped.
headbutt the door!
dat door
oooooohhhh...
Doors cannot open without creaking.
It's impossible.
Alchemist: HA in response to our image to mine
Some moments in this game are pretty nice 'n creepy.
*your
Game needs more WD40
it reminds me of the scene from star wars, where darth vader puts his helmet on XD
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: :)
So, these games are the first "escape the room" style point 'n' click games?
brb
I thought it was Phase4 playing RealMyst yesterday.
why do doors take so long to open?
ok awake for reals this time
MaidSurge: more like adventure games
Kandarihu: it was
Oh god damn it my parents are doing it again
Good morning then
Because that's how doors work in wherever-the-hell-this-is-ville
...
Doing...What...?
its 1...pm..
You're gonna have a new little brother or sis... wait, doing _what_ exactly?
I wish they would quit arguing all the damn time
Bronysith: but those go way back before Myst
good afternoon more likes
oops
MaidSurge: still an adventure game
One little thing pisses one of them off and they go into a rage
knew it!
Doors creaking, it's the coconut effect. It would be perfectly realistic if they didn't make that noise, but nobody would accept it. So the doors squeak.
13okay ponies
A toilet?
13so i don't horribly bore you
13speed run
13or normal run?
Speed.
speed run
get the chainsaw first
Let us guess the puzzles. :D
Im okay with a normal run
What ever yeilds the interesting results
derpy_pony: what?
normal
play the game while on speed
13let's solve the gateroom together, not that there's much to solve
drugs are bad, mmkay?
kk
It's aesthetically cool but I hate point and click games.
Oo, Riven.
DEATH STAR!
So has anyone here played the Mario & Luigi series of games?
O___o
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-best-bucking-job-ever1.png
The first time I played Myst... dem memories
do a barrel roll
And then the room moved.
Deeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaad.
When i played that game the game had to let me change the disc to number 2 to going to the next part
good game design is when you don't even realize you have to figure out a puzzle
behind 2 of the doors are bloodthirsty hamsters
how many times is this going to remind me of star wa- ...oh sweet jesus....
the first time I played Myst...I closed it 5 minutes after starting and never touched it again <.<
Actually, the whole world is moving and the room isn't.
13the button isn't animating
13oh well
13ded
Starfrench: touche
Welp
back
i stone room moving totaly atural nothing here
ded
Shizuka its just touch sensitive, no need to press it
I remember when I first played Myst. . .-none- of the animations actually worked.
Ikr EspyLacopa
I'm an assasin, not a crazed gunman.
13ponies paying attention to how the room works?
Thunk
Nice i like how the whole room just rotates
move the room so the entrance is in the little cave on the right side?
No. :I
And a good many of the puzzles in it depended on working animations.
Shizuka, i think i have a solution to the game
Sadly Shizuka my headache makes any sound or moving picture hurt. :(
So is it rotating or are we?
Shizuka yes... but tell us anyway so we can see that you know it :I
:O
well, that was easy
NUKE THE PLANET FROM ORBIT!
11,01A room works like this: You have four walls that hold a roof up.
And I -loathed- the spaceship piano note puzzle in Myst 1.
FlyBoy: its the only way to be sure
its the only way to be sure
11,01And usually an entryway of some sort in one of the walls.
any sound or moving picture yo say Vordox ? http://i.imgur.com/5RgAR.gif
wh
and that changed what?
SpadeMagnes[R]: Game over man! Game over!
13what does steam do when put under pressure
Screw this, imma go play COD
why are we on that weird planet
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Stupidity of others gives me a automatic headache
compress
Shizuka: It explodes?
EXPLOSIONS!
Steam melts when ujder pressure
Anyone know if AgentKalim has been here?
I hate it when I hear machine sounds but have absolutely NO idea what happened
Steam.exe has stopped responding.
11,01Turns to water.
11,01Seriously.
Bronysith: oh u Foster's Home :D
11,01If you compress it enough.
Vordox: must a missed something
Shizuka: it turns into a white alicorn with a taste for molesting
oh wait, wrong gas
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: No it's called "The world"
11,01Lol FlyBoy
Maid_Discord yes, but thats really really unlikely to make THAT much pressure
:D
DUN DUN DUUUUUN
:o
:O:O:O:O:O:O:O
11,01brony_boy115: no smiley spam, please.
Im scared
ok

:'(
oh, I came this far in the game, I remember. but then..I quit
Thats no moon, Thats a space station!
oooh! tetris!

Bronysith: thats 4
Bronysith: oh thats pretty f*ckin' coo'
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: no. theres only 3 doctors there
Bronysith: who's that first bloke? he ain't no doctor!
Bronysith: Oh yeah, 3.
MaidSurge: thats what i said
5th, 3rd, and the last Doctor so far, 10th.
13what do you notice about the bridge in the up position
11,01Any Dr.Toilets?
there is no 11th
nope
it looks like a penis?
11,01Ooh, a panda-store!
waiting for john d lancie to get the part
or is that just me
stairs!
11,01Let's buy pandas.
FlyBoy you might want to get that checked
why no 4th doctor?
/me gives Nittany_Discord a panda maid
How exactly is DeLancie pronounced?
13so we want to get up the stairs right?
it's like a ladder Shizuka ?
Shizuka: it goes in the upper level?
Wow. I'm still on the FIRST Doctor :S
13to do that, we need to get into the gateroom
its like a staircase in the up-position?
dee-lans-ee
13but we can't do that while the bridge is up
What game is being played?
Shizuka, are you playing this game?
13but there's another way in
steps then path
How is Suicune pronounced? I always pronounce it weird
not day lance e?
Bronysith: funny
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-its-the-true.jpg
11,01Shizuka: Go into a corner and cry. You win the game!
I think I would have to play myself in order to figure things out XD
SpadeMagnes[R]: sweecune
probably, dunno
John DeLancie is best brony.
No questions asked.
gabe newell
That didnt sound good
I would be so lost in this game .__.
I Think Tara Stong is asserting herself as the Queen of The Bronies

Stallion_of_War: Wait what?

Dear Fox News... Drop dead.
Stallion_of_War Cnn on the other hand....

I rmemeber Fox news claiming that the bronies were going to have an orgy at BronyCon.

I remember there's a point here where it teaches you the number system, and thus what those symbols behind the eyeballs actually mean.
Myst, according to the Guiness Boomof World Records, is the least violent game of all time.
11,01Leisure Suit Larry.
*Book
Super batman Sonic 64
Mass Effect.
Nittany_Discord your streaming leisure suit??
11,01No.

Someone once told me that the classic Doctor Who was boring. I don't get it.
Battletoads
:P
the alien?
i can see it
its a Half Life Symbol
13and he is holding men in each hand over a whale
Looks fine to me.
Shizuka: i can see it
k back
He's the father of the guy you saved at the end of Myst, right?
I could BARELY see that. Shizu
13i know, it's not great contrast
the first doctor was....different....no bowtie...no mojo
I meant to put a comma there :S
It's also used in science
anyway gtg

13what you just saw there is someone running out to get their kid inside
if it was a half life symbol then are you playing as Gordon Freeman?
bye guys!
Nittany_Discord and angles that are changing
13they're afraid of you
>Hating on the first doctor
You kidding? The First Doctor was awesome.
"Its a brony! HIDE YOUR KIDS!!"
Over protective mothers.
Hide yo kids hide yo wife
I mean, he made the whole show popular in the UK.
Shizuka: is your character Zecora
Guys this is not the time nor place to be having Doctor discussions
are you some horrible monster ? is that why you're not shown ? or is it because you camefrom the book god man we saw depicted ?
Someone trying to solve puzzles?
I think Derpy is mimicing the alien guy
HIDE
No one is home
come out or I eat your cat!
or there is...
go ahead. eat oppelesence good ridence
Do we find out why they're scared of you?
Pilfer the fish
13who has been terrorizing them pretty well
Shizuka: Who?
Or another roller coster?
It is now.
I hope it's another rollercoster!
the protagonist is randomly pushing all buttons on dangerously old machines
13anyone notice anything weird about the water
. . . Aww darn it!
Lil_B: woah that was delayed
Shizu: Like how it's weirdly clear?
What the heck?
transparent?
13better
Lil_B: how about wavelength instead of brightness? ;)
No, look at it.
Yoou sunk it
repelled by the craft
Maaagic
Well.
Aliens
Frieeendship
Shizuka: Then the water isn't water, it would have to be alive, or controlled by someone.
oh...this
Can we take the fire.
And smoke the natives out.
<:
Fire hot
Why so evil, Dari?
Alchemist damnit!!!you are right again XD I always mix things up!! (and I'm not talking about chemichals ;) )
Why not? :3
I just want to hug them. :<
Fire Burning on the Walking Floor
what exactly are we watching O_o?
use natives to test the machines
If I was being evil, I'd say take the fire and burn down all their houses. :P
This is Riven.
It's the magical leoplurodons again!
this game is Beautiful

Something definatly isnt right here

SpadeMagnes[R] whats your first clue :P
Swiss Cheese Water :/
Chrysalis water
Bloody sploicers.
Give them the one two punch
Hey look, a school room.
13now this is the part that stuns me
Bingo room?
13first, that paper i looked at is someone having a spelling test in the D'ni language
13second, there are plaques on the wall with a D'ni letter each
13armed with ONLY THAT
G13 B8 I 47 N42 O19
Oh wow, this is a classroom?
13people worked out the language and translations for all the text in the game
13in 1997
Yup
13mysties are smart fillies :3
Nerds
I believe this is also where you learn the number system as well.
13yup
mysties are MST3K fans
Wut
is the d'ni language just english with a permutated alphabet?
11,01Wait until Mr.Krabs finds out that this stream is a toilet.
Hi dudes, what are we playing?
is that Lyod Bridges?
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-tank-simply-walks-into-mordor.jpg
13John Keston ladies and gentlemen
MegaMoonShine: Riven
13lives in minnesota, and is a marathon runner now
11,01Is that a politician?
Howdy MegaMoonShine!
13he's like 70
SPEAK ENGLISH
Bomb?
Nittany_Discord: :D the toilet line.
Lloyd Bridges was dead for a while before this game was released.
13now here's your brilliant game design
oh
13not only is this teaching you the numbers, it's showing you the world
doesn't sound like just a permutated alphabet
Let me show you the world....
13rivenese kids learn the D'ni numbers with a toy that lowers people to their deaths
13how messed up is that
Heh
Well, no more messed up than us playing hangman.
Hangman extreme
11,01Shizuka: Teach 'em young.
13quit giving me eight! i want other numbers ><
Arrow = 8
Jonah the game
Backwards h symbol
Chair = 3 I think that was?
11,01I wonder if there's a real-life version of this game.
Left is gonna lose
Ohhh
He ded
Damn!
Chair with Line = Mystery still
11,01You lose!
the symbol where the bug was
Ah, Chair is 4.
/me 13knows these by heart ofc
K is 2.
ofc?
ahh symbols in the bottom
133
|) | is still missing
matched to sounds?
KI is 2 right?
13the number of clicks
Line is 5
Shizuka: You sure you don't have a list on you ;).
13Everlasting_Joy: nope, cause i know 10 and up too
13this toy ends at 10
coffee table is 5
13but you have to learn up to 24
13there's a pattern
Arc on bottom: 10
laptop is 10
like roman numerals?
Let's test Shizuka's multiplication. XD
Cross is 6
Rice field is six.
Cross * Line = ?
window sihl is 6
this game is interesting...never thought there were good puzzle games....
13line in which direction :3
13i'll spoil for you, there are four digits, 1-4
Horizontal. Heh.
Horizontal line
ded
13rotate the digit 90 degrees and get that multiple of 5
11,01I WIN!
13so 5 is 1 turned on its side
136 is 5 + 1
13and so on
I don't even
Figuring out these first 10 can get the full pattern of 24, essentially.
13I 1, DI 2, KI 3, r 4
13everything is built around the number 5
That's a 7
Mind=Splattered across the wall.
Bow and Arrow be 7
13people also worked out the letters are based on the numbers
Or rather, 5 + 2.
see guys THIS is a puzzle game, not this crap most studios now believe is a puzzle game
Weird water repulsion
13i used to have the letters memorized but not anymore
And it is vitally important to learn the entire number system.
all the narration by shizu! the master of all things riven and myst!
13yup
A game that requires you to remember shit? What a shock
also ohai shizu!
Remember? Nah.
This game expected you to -take notes-
13and you really do have to learn the number system, the combinations that use it change every game
Remember how in old games the last few pages were blank and were titled "Notes"?
EspyLacopa: You mean those had a purpose?
I'm used to skyrim style puzzles...."follow the arrow!" "arrange the three symbols just like these three on the opposite wall!"....idiot puzzles
13if this were a modern game, the screen would have shaken just there
So is anyone excited for KH3D?
13there's something big in the water
KH3D?
Sudden Prince of Persia style lever/handle?
13those look rather like handcuffs don't they
Kingdom Hearts 3d Dream Drop Distance
Inb4 sharl
Nah
Shark
13oh hey there it is
So this is the real version of the game we saw earlier?
13never knew it would call while you're here
No my brother played the demo. Sora doesn't sound like sora ata all
13yup
Things I learned from Doctor Who: to dismantle a bomb, pour corrosive acid on it and mangle up the insides with a stick.
the hardest game I have played were normal Poin't and Click adventures like Monkey Island :/
is it true pong was the first video game?
Yes.
13no tennis was
13played on an oscilloscope
SpadeMagnes[R]: techancly no
SpadeMagnes[R]: You don't know that? :|
00,02i see riven
Isn't Pong just Tennis?
00,02i hear a clock
Hello Phase
Tick-Tock?
Tick tock clock
SpadeMagnes[R]: the first game was called tenis,and was some sort of modification on ship's radars
pong was just the first wildly succesful video game
I see and hear Phase4 :) Hi
What game is this?
Myst and Riven both pretty much expect you to take all sorts of notes.
well guys i'd better be going. homework to do :/
Looks important? It likely is, better make a note.
Good morning Phase4
00,02morning everyone
13that's not ominous at all :3
3rd video game was Space invaders?

Hi, Good afternoon everyone
11,01Morning Phase4.
Shrine to Satan? :P
00,02morning Nittany_Discord
No Shizuka, find the red pages!
13so if you recall, that symbol was 4
SpadeMagnes[R]: no,they would rewite the ship radar's comands and would then play it
13which means something about the magical leopleurodon is 4
it wants sacrifices
:D
The order of a sequence of animal symbols later on?
Zuul
00,02not sure if srs about leopleurodon
The 4th one is a magical leopleurodon
13the canonical name is sunners i think
Those woodsman cut down all those trees.

Another minecraft ride

/me throws hooves in the air
Awwwwwww shiiiiiiiiit!
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I believe there are ways to get stuck, mostly due to not having taken notes.
00,02Shizuka, ah, cause excluding the endings i noticed it was imposible to 'fail' myst
wooooow
Remember when games used to punish you badly for fucking up?
13yup
weeeee
Now were entering that one Disneyworld ride?
MAKE THIS A RIDE NAO!
Kinda like if you go to one of the ages in Myst without knowing any of the clues from the library.
Shizuka I suggest you play Myst3
Litwick: No, this is Willy Wonka's crazy tunnel territory.
13riven's water has bacteria in it that actively avoid heat
You just saved the world, what are you gonna do now?
sierra games punished you randomly for not saving
13they are also highly toxic, so water is boiled to kill them
Theres no earthly way of knowing...
00,02so rings of heat hold back water?
Which direction we are going....
13yup
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-sappy-mlp-love-story.jpg
So. . .lava rings.
Not a speck of lgiht is showing so the danger must be growing
derpy_pony: Rule 1 of sierra games, always SAVE before you do ANYTHING
13Litwick: AND IT CERTAINLY SHOWS NO SIGNS OF SLOWING
AND ITS CERTAINLY NOT SHOWING
Sierra games have a tendancy to have ANYTHING kill you
ANY SIGNS THAT THEY ARE SLOWING
Weeeeee. . .!
*high pitched yell*
What about the cave force rings?
*goofy yell*
good old times
Litwick: At least it isn't a grue.

Because magic
13anyway back into the wood chipper
Shit
Inb4 turned on
OMG derpy in may the best pet win in the chicken coup
Bronysith: That's one of my favorite comics. It falls under "anywhere else and we'd be saying 'no'".
Hey
00,02Shizuka, do you turn it off or does it turn itself off?

In two hours, I think

I think I need to cut my hair
I WANT TO OBSERVE something I haven't seen yet
ARGH
So annoying
I remember playing Myst on weed and giving up after a few minutes
Right, I'm going back to Doctor Who.
Polydunami|DoctorWho: What episode are you on?

Let's see... currently the First Doctor and I'm on his granddaughter's last serial.

You can see yourself :O

Cosmo: Ahhh so much clogging
There's one puzzle game - Scihsm - I've had for years, but have never figured out the first couple of puzzles - not at all like Myst
I dont see these toilets

Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: the fauq did i just read?
11,01Lol Litwick
SpadeMagnes[R]: if i could link a vid i would

Litwick: I would pay to see that :D
Why does the animation only work sometimes?
11,01Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: No non-image links during stream, please.
13sometimes i space to skip it
Nittany_Discord: yes of course
so much gold, must be el Dorado
Nittany_Discord: oh was that not just an image with text
11,01Cypresswolf: Mass diarrhea. Mystery solved. When Shizuka gets to the island toilets, they'll see everyone there.
I believe this is pretty much the main puzzle of the entire game.
elavator shadt?
13i could probably still do this from memory
shaft*
13but we have an island to visit
:D
Can ya dig it?
11,01I can dig it.
11,01Jut barely.
He's one bad mother fu-
Shizuka...all the memorizing@

Saving is over rated!
13well anyway
Silly when you never save.
13i need to be done for a while
13i will get us back to that position later
well I think this is a good point to end for today XD
Wh4t now?

That is what she said
Bye Lil_B.

Oh man Riven
Isn't there going to be some movies shown tonight?
You know what we should stream?
Not played that in forever
Big rigs
Good evening everypony
/me has no stream
Big rigs would be best stream
It's a pity that the MMO Myst Game never really got off the ground.
11,01Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Is that a vidoe?
13it's more a pity i couldn't get ponies interested enough in uru live to put up with the friends list setup...
13i wanted to solve puzzles with ponies but noo...
Anyone interested in Dark Moon?
13too boring und confusing to walk here and do this action like shizu tells you..
11,01Shizuka: If only my computer worked.
shizu...i would of done it! or attempted to....
I...honestly would not have.
so no more video?
I like puzzle games it's the only thing that doesn't bore me
i would for a while.. then i would go crazy cause i'm not good with puzzles
So who here has played Luigi's Mansion?
Nittany_Discord: on my laptop its only a still frame with lyrics in the description from derpibooru
Mostly because of the 'boring' thig.
thing*
11,01Same.
13uru is about the exploration though
13cool environments
I'll be away for about ten or twenty minutes.
So now what?
Well, this is the first I've heard of this uru thing, what exactly /is/ it?
...
Downloading Fallout 3 game of the year edition.
From what I gathered, Uru -was- good, but it lacked the support or some such to become awesome.
WH4T NOW?
13uru live tried getting off the ground but ubi dropped them
13then they tried with gametap, actually got through some interesting content, then gametap dropped them
Hallo
Investigate pumpkin
13then there was until uru which ran off community servers, and now myst online uru live which is run by a metric ton of donations
Why does no one want to bring it back up?
I AM NOW LITWICK, THE URINAL KING.
13probably cause of how the content worked
13most of uru live is already available in uru the singleplayer (plus the two expansions)
what the hell is uru?
WORSHIP THINE URINAL KING.
Atler_Tempest: A video game
13they tried to do a realtime story thing where in-universe characters would log into the game and interact with people
Litwick: Nah
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uru:_Ages_Beyond_Myst <-- Uru
Atler_Tempest: Uru: Ages of Myst
13probably didn't work out due to people being able to miss important developments
MegaMoonShine: ah... myst games, cool
so um what now?
So has anyone here played the Mario and Luigi series?
so um what now?
13i have a video somewhere that someone took of the day the gametap servers shut down, had a whooooole lot of players in one place waiting for it
That must of hurt

Shizuka: I'd be interested in playing URU live - making an account now
13they knew it was coming, it was kind of a "get together for the end of the world" thing
Shizuka: that's one of those ideas awesome on paper but really really impractical :|
wat r all of you beautiful folks up too hmm?
13when i tried getting people interested in january there were maybe 20 people in the public city instance
13which is about how it had always been
ChronoClutch: discussing Myst the series
So any of you guys gonna get Pokemon Black/White 2?
Well, gave Uru a look over. Doesn't strike my fancy.
me neither
13but it's too awesome to be able to solve puzzles with your friends, and there's some puzzles you actually need friends to solve
i search wat Myst is nao
SpadeMagnes[R]: maybe? Probably will wait for the price to go down
...... sigh
I like the idea of exploring a new world. It's why I like reading so much
Bronysith I don't get it
13oo they finally released the source code too
Why do replys come way after I post something?
ChronoClutch: nothing ryhmes with orange
I must have relaly bad chat lag
door hinge
peace out
13http://mystonline.com/en/play/ anyway if ponies are interested go here
13maybe i'll try getting us together again
ChronoClutch: doesnt work like that
yesh it does
ChronoClutch: its two words
soo
it's
hey Shamroc loook http://derpy.me/rQnHw
it doesn't work man
/me throws the stream on the ground
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: omg
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: ha
Alpha-Omega: truth be told, my fav game of all times would be exploring a new world and do whatever you want. Kinda like that space Robinson but with less medical attention :D
*space Robinson Crusoe
:( no more stream?
So has anyone thought about buying Dark Moon?
Depends, what's Dark Moon?
The new luigi's mansion game
No.
Luigi's mansion: Dark Moon
She'll be back tho :)
/me is forever alone
No I do not like Nintendo Anymore
MaidSurge: Well I know it crashed but how long will it take?

Meanwhile: the hell?
13i would love if ponies could put up with the setup process for usu
13uru rather
13i got us a BronyState neighborhood so we'd all be on the same buddy list
Sonic 06 had good music I'll give it that
I'm downloading it as we speak
13it just takes a bunch of steps to make it your primary neighborhood out of the box
what exactly is uru?
SpadeMagnes[R]: shit game
/me is bored
Bronysith: It had good music though
SpadeMagnes[R]: so?
if it was a shit game
what exactly is uru?
:) A Uru Bronystate branch - nice
why play it?
For shits and giggles?
... SpadeMagnes[R] /)
Can you voice chat in this game?
(\
I wonder if I'll ever fill this damn pokedex
Anyway.....
wow...my Uru installation countdown :D - went up to 3 days 14 hours for 1.2 gigs - less that 2 hr & 30 min now
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRPlI4RAGSc&feature=relmfu Stream needs more chemical plant
I'm downloading uru and Fallout 3 so might take a while
Cypresswolf: yay! Quicker! :D
If your computer took 3 days to download something I'd assume you were planning on taking down an alien invasion with it.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-how-did-he-know.jpg
I could take a nap and it would install even quicker :)
Maybe I should play some megaman starforce for a bit...

11,01Why game disks are better: No waiting for downloads (sans patches).
Except those can get scratched
My 360 seems to be putting tons of tiny scratches on my discs
11,01But you have a physical copy.
anypony got anymore links to youtube vids that I probably never saw
Well I could watch MLP season 1 and 2 as I wait for dowlaod
Bronysith: the teacher we want, not the teacher we need :D

I prefer disk though.
I want to build my own computer - I'm sick of Vista! - either getting a mac or XP
Mac not good for gaming

>Welp
What the heck kind of OS cant update to the newer version :|
Ohai
Except Alienware
get XP :D
11,01Why not Windows 7?
I accidentaly broke a disk
HORY SHEERT DERPY http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-lauren-faust-is-always-many-steps-ahead.jpg
It has a massive scratch ring on it
I have windows 7 :'( it sucks
Who not Mandows?
*Why
Why not Ronbow Dosh?
11,01That's the 360's fault.
Why not Dolan?
Nittany_Discord: Actually thats my fault
spade every try rubbing alchohol on the scratch :P
I accidentaly turned it a bit while the disc was in it
11,01Oh.
It was Banjo and Kazzoie nuts and bolts
Never liked it anyway
11,01SB showed a review of that game.
I have Windows 7, but Vista always finds some *rages*....something to stop the installation process - last attempt was 3 months ago - spent a full week figuring out how to patch those problems only for Vista to bring up new ones
Also whats the proper way to have it set up?
11,01It made me >.(\
Vertical or Horizontal?
11,01Either should work.
now
morrowind. yes or no on buying it
:) Thats why my last set of headphones only had 1 speaker working :P
Is it normal for tiny mostly unnoticable scratches ot appear on the disc?
11,01I guess.
Need new headphones. Should I buy the Turtle beach x12s?
11,01You shouldn't get scratches at all from play.
I think my thing is just shit..
......so
got the 2010 version of medal of honor today, finished 10 mins ago. wtf
I wish I knew what was causing all the scratches

11,01Of course, that joke may not apply anymore.

And you don't buy a ps3 unles you like a station that sucks
What do you mean?
Bronysith: wat a nice bonding moment
11,01Dunno the fail rate of the slim models.
Actually the ps3 is a good console
Slim models?
Nittany_Discord: Mine was a gen1 and is still going strong. :)
ps3 had demons souls. pretty good game
Mine is one of those black 360's
Hallo
The slim actually runs a better graphic processor as well as a tricore processor
FairysHuff: Hiya
I havent had much of a problem with my 360 breaking - though it has froze a couple of times playing Skyrim
Nittany_Discord: isnt the slim 360 the one with the scratch problems
360^
11,01I don't know.
killerpony7733 Holla. *Snuggles*
11,01I thought the whites had scratch problems as well as heating problems.
I have an intercooler ;)

Well god damn...
I heard there are 360 pony skins - anyone know where I can find some?
the slim 360s are more angular then the original
11,01My PS3 has a custom pony theme.
Why the fuck would they even make a slim model
11,01Watch the grimdark Bronysith.
Nittany_Discord: lucky
Nittany_Discord: evil twin?
It cant even do things that require a hard drive
11,01No. The Rainbow Factory one.
Becaus they needed to keep us occupied untill the 720 comes out
Ive seen a few on ebay - but its a custom console - I already have the console
oright
G'night everypony! :)
Whats going on?
It was to make a smaller and cheaper version

EVE > Wow
<.<
Yeah ok now you're just trolling.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-untitled1.jpg
nope, fact
EVE has all the fun of temporary office work except you don't get paid.
Nope opinion
And in fact have to pay to do so.
in eve you cant grind to max level in a week
only people who dont have lives wouldgrind that much
it takes a year minimum to get into a titan
What kind of sadact devotes a year to that?
I got from lvl 60 to lvl 80 in less than a month though
oh sht i need to play rotmg
But that was because I had nothing to do
...
Played EVE for 6 years. Are you still capable of feeling happy?
I highly doubt a MMO is gonna come along and keep me from playing WoW
/me hijacks stream.
training is not like wow
you dont ... do stuff and *ding* I learned new things
/me 11,01wishes his computer would start normally.
I'll stick to GW2. :P
Wut?
its time based, as in RL time based
You do, you just do it much much slower.
<.<
How does it start... er abnormally?
Why would I want to do things in a game in real time?
11,01No POST beeps during start-up.
11,01I can't afford to fix it.
I tried EVE once a couple years ago and got bored nearly to death within an hour.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzq8Xnk1Ga0&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577
you set your skill queue and play the game as you normally would, and you can log off when you want to, and you still learn things
Sounds like the speaker on the board is disconnected or broken.
RyunosukeKnT: So idleing then
I fail to see how learning things while not playing is a point in favour.
Meanwhile: the thing is, if you solo eve, you will be board
Sounds lazy and gay
Its like tf2 idles
RyunosukeKnT Thats what I did day one of my free week.
I fell asleep at my computer
Why play the game if you just get shit by doing nothing
you can always learn to play EVE, read articles on the game mechanics, etc. :)
EVE strikes me as the type of game you don't really play but rather leave open in another window at work.
Or apparently not even leave open
EVE is your job.
And you pay it to work.
=|
RyunosukeKnT: How about no, keep your shitty game and I'll keep my good MMO
hey bronies would it be akward for having a lottery of pony episodes being part 1 and 2 of a 2 part saga?
Meanwhile: you watched the Zero Punctuation review on it didnt you?
I certainly did. But I also tried it.
Eve was the best nap I ever had.
00,10enjoy http://tinyurl.com/84vquak
On my keyboard.
the thing is, EVE isnt really known for its mechanics as it is known on the community and how they USE said mechanics
EVE is a sandbox,
pure and simple
And really, Yahtzee is bang on the mark. If you really find EVE fun then power to you. It's still mind numbingly dull for the average person.
Again sounds dull
/me 11,01enjoys Sumica
Eve, at least for me, is known for the epic back stabs that said community does to itself for isk. or wahtever.
Great community
there is no hand holding in EVE, like in wow, it is cutthoat and brutal
00,10Eve the only game that gives you time to play other games
What Barbetos|Atwork said.
Wow isnt handholding
bullshit
hey bronies! I can beat portal 1 and 2 in one day
I never had handholding when I play
Hey go kill 20 wild boars then go see this guy in goldshire!
00,10RyunosukeKnT, there is a ton of hand holding in eve now, compared to when i started it
riiiiight
When something interesting happens in EVE it's usually really interesting. What with their company fleets and territory and politics and flim flam.
That isnt handholding dumb ass
it is imo
My old computer teacher beat it an one hour
wow Sumica
00,10there is a safty system to keep you out of low sec space
Its called a quest moron
But getting to that stage takes forever.
http://www.livestream.com/snappleshroom
oh your lvl 30 you should be in duskwood farming spiders!
I started playing WoW in TBC and it's way more hand-holdy now than it was.
you can theoritically be in 0.0 on your 1st day
I never had these "handholding" issues with WoW
SpadeMagnes[R]: When did you lvel
level*
00,10yes you can but you have to turn off the safty system to do so.
and sumica, I admit, EVE now is more... newbie friendly than when I started, which is a good thing imo
What do you mean when?
SpadeMagnes[R]: When did you start playing? Are you Cata? Wrath? TBC? Vanilla?
back when I started... you were given the most basic of commands to learn and kicked out the airlock
I started last summer twoards the very end of Wrath
Shizuka: gonna try installing uru
13:o
13yay~
00,10when I started I was't even in a spacestation I started in a ship in the arse end of nowhere with the text of "you are in space: here is how you target, here is how you warp, have fun.
Wrath babies talking about WoW not holding hands. Irooonnnyyyyyy.
Meanwhile: I never had these issues
13also yaaaaaaaaaaay i think... this latest patch talks about fireworks when you have all 12 sparklies... which i really really hope means they fixed the minkata sparkly
Sumica: that is almost how I started, I started just after Bloodlines
Hand holding isn't an issue, it's the opposite of one.
I fail to see what consitutes as handholding anyway
I have to sleep people, goodnight :F
night MaidSurge
11,01Night MaidSurge
Right..... sure....
And Heirlooms make everyone so op at low levels that group quests don't even exist anymore.
11,01Have maidy dreams.
Night MaidSurge
thats another thing
00,10When I started eve there was no jumpgate cloak and space mines still worked.
Will sure do, Nittany_Discord :D
Meanwhile: Those are for people who cant do shit their selves
/me stretches
00,10then again you could also fit torps on a friggate and stack afterburrners on any ship
hello ~
hello
uhmmmmmmm
you arent ... powered by items and ships as much as you are by skill level (both in character and RL) skills in using said items and ships
Ahh more Brony Music for my list
When I levelled my rogue back in TBC I had to go find a bunch of schmucks to take down the Ghostlands elite abombs, now you can just zerg them. The world is less real and more streamlined and that's a sad thing.
/me 11,01stretches derp_derp. Hi!
see: failfits
Eve still sounds dull
like the ever popular failfit: Laser raven :)
Yes.;
Reality is MMO combat is all the same formula. Start hitting each other and whoever has the blastier gun wins.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzq8Xnk1Ga0&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577
why aren't violets violet?
I like EVE's music.
as I said, the real fun in EVE is playing with friends :)
You can harp on about skill all you like but pvp in MMO's generally comes down to "Which side has the healer and which side has a stunlocker?"
I have friends in WoW So there
kinda...
Playing anything with friends is more fun than playing it by yourself, that's applicable to anything.
it depends on what kind of fleets you are running and what you are doing
that is true Meanwhile
Meanwhile: Eeyup, soloing TERA is a bit boring as I know no one who plays it.
So true Meanwhile
It's ironic that I'd be the one to say that because I have no friends.
/me shrugpony.
whats with the ponychat tab?
I have no real life friends
All my friends are in my guild
Thank you for that post now I have more music to add to my brony playlist
well Im off to sleep
goodnight everyone!
Still not sure if I should bother downloading this Uru thing
Night Alchemist.
11,01Night Alchemist
Eh, Uru doesn't appeal to me in the slightest. I imagine I'd get bored within five minutes.
I like puzzle games but I doubt it will be interesting for me
/me has one IRL friend and thats all he needs, to quote a certain somepony "It is better to have one friend of great value than many friends who were good for nothing."
00,10http://images.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3667-1331797496419.gif

I don't mind puzzle games but only at my pace.
11,01Sumica: Same.
Sumica: All day erryday. :/
Sumica: Yeep
11,01My anxiety issues are preventing me from finding work sadly.
D:
00,10well it's kinda a lie cause i did go to work, but I daydreamed all day.
I have got to get my dad to buy me a desktop instead of a laptop
Sumica you work at a casino correct?
00,10nah I quit that job
He lives in Vegas, ofc he works at a casino.
00,10i am a Baker now
That's all they have in Vegas.
Ah i see
Working at a casino doesnt sound as fun as it should be
Don't listen to him, he's lying. In Vegas they eat poker chips.
Sumica: wat did you do at your casino job?
00,10giveme all your friendchips
00,10I was a cook

killerpony7733, i didn't assume the worst, i mearly prepared for the worst, there is a difference!
Polydunami|DoctorWho: cause celestia likes it when we sweat
Geeze, you guys are in an oven.
This isnt normal
It's currently 17 Celsius, which makes it about 61-62 Fahrenheit here.
Whoops, my weather didn't update since June.
It's currently about 70 degrees.
its 90 here
MYAAH
Seriously what the fuck is with this weather?
Oh my
17.3°C here...light rain...acceptable weather conditions
Agreed.
So that's about 61-62 degrees Fahrenheit
any stream?
No.
Not at the moment
Could use more Kerbals or something
Gah, back to playing Megaman Starforce 3...
SpadeMagnes[R], Back to the Future is starting in 25 minutes
here?
I'm playing it right next to the comp
So I dont seem to be going anywhere
The movie.

11,01We don't even have flying toilets.
They promised us hovering skateboards :I

back to the future 2
11,01Since The Jetsons aired.

I forget what year they said we would have flying cars by
2015
also its a double feature this week
are there movies every night? it's 00:37 here...I'm not awake at this time very often
BTF and Terminator I believe
nice
Back to playing Mario and Luigi
Movie night starts RIGHT when I leave from work, I alway miss like the first 30 minutes. =(
derpy_pony: it depends on whos streaming and events
sweet, i thought i imagined that part
Hmmm what to play...
this summer is trilogies
the Summer fun has been tripled
how do you know about the events? what happens and when.
when they announce them :)
can't remember reading anything about them in the newsletter
only in the chatroom?
or the newsletter or site
It's on the newsletter.
it helps to read the newsletter or main page too :)
They announce the trilogy being played.
hm...ok...maybe I should read the whole thing next time ^^
Hey wait it's monday doesn't that mean there's a movie on in like, 20 minutes?

Bronysith: again, Han didnt shoot first, he's the only one who shot :)
Meanwhile: star wars nerds like me
So no one of importance.
RyunosukeKnT: /)

At first I read USAF as USMC, and the mention of figher jets confused me.

You can let Tovler know that I AM on, but he has me on ignore.
11,01The Marines have fighter jets.
Crud. That was too authoritative of me.
Nittany_Discord: good idea

God damn EA. They don't even make games.

They publish other people's games.

My response? "They don't make games."

Most of them are BIG LIPPED ALLIGATOR MOMENTS
Sumica: lol
It's your kids Marty! Your daughter is an alicorn who likes to rape people!
This scene explains quite a bit.

bioware makes the good game
Bioware makes the game, EA takes the credit.

11,01EA probably ruined the game.
lol
Nittany_Discord: THATS WHAT I SAID
11,01Forcing the DLC and rushed ending.
It's happened before.

Where's that EA in a nutshell video?
The same damn thing happens all over the place.

LOL
11,01These major publishers do tell the devs what to do. The publishers are paying for the game.
lol
Oh man
Ew.

Movies, anime, games, television...the publisher strangles the developer.

Sumica: like highbeams it is :D
why did they cut that bit out?
or no
the voices sound weird
how's everypony doing?
11,01Valve isn't on the stock market.
Exception: Studio Ghibli. In general, Disney dubs/imports Ghibli movies on Hayao Miyazaki's terms.
bored
Mutterguy: time constraints, they realized they didn't really NEED the scene
Annoying bit at the end of Arrietty, though.

09,01how the fuck do you cancel a Standing Fierce into a Shoryuken
NewDCD: hmmm.. idk. it sounds fun but idk if GO is actually any good
hahaha
09,01I don't even think you can link it
lols
this lloks so familiar
Tov|Drunk: it wasn't made by valve
lol
ew
never got into counter strike
wha?
Haha
Bronysith: Its OK, but the new shot spread is annoying
lol
Gay.
...
what?
XD
Take a few liberties! I'll opPRESS her!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
That's awesome¬
00,10geeee wonder why they cut this bit
!
wait
your own GRANDPA! lol
11,01Lol,
you got a problem with gays?!
hahahahaha
13can't imagine
YES!
Why shouldn't you be happy?
Unnr: should i stick with source?
Molest your mother in the past, become gay in the future
Sounds legit
gay means happy too
:)
PFffty
Barbetos: yeah that makes a lot of sense
Lol.
LOL
Freefall29: was it at least published by Vavle?
lol
pffftft
DashieMusic2: yes yes it does
Bronysith: Until they work on doing some re-balancing of the weapons, yes
Beats the shit outta me
I'd like to think he bribed the cop for the amount of money it costs FOR the permit. And the cop will later come back with the permit.
Tov|Drunk: it was a fan mod, then published by valve after they got the rights to it from the makers
lol
cant it mean both?
okay, that line was TOO casual
StupidSexyCJ: it used to just mean happy
StupidSexyCJ: then it more or less became a slur
huh
StupidSexyCJ: back then, it wasent a gay bashing phrase
But yeah, there's commentary for the deleted scenes that explains why each one was cut.
WHOA........that last scene was tottally uncalled for O______O
Bronysith: You know how in source, each spread is a predictable pattern? In GO they randomized it.
I knew it, I knew the TARDIS was in this movie!
Freefall29: Fanmod of what? TFclassic?
which can be very, very annoying
Unnr: bullshit
now that i think of it... why do i have EA mobile on FB if i don't even play games on my phone
back then, they all had gay dinner parties
Unnr: such bullshit
Tov|Drunk: Counter-strike is a half-life mod
11,01Operator, my butt stock dropped.
>.>
well i wouldnt exactly call it a gay-bashing phrase
best principal ever
Tov|Drunk: you don't play game a lot, do you?

Freefall29: Well because of the nature of videogames, it annoys me. I'd prefer to see it as an artform.
I don't see why final fantasy 7 is taking so long for remake. all it is just a simple HD remake. get some good looking models and that's it. a pure port to the ps3
