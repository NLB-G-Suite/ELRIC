And then the room moved.
Deeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaad.
behind 2 of the doors are bloodthirsty hamsters
the first time I played Myst...I closed it 5 minutes after starting and never touched it again <.<
Actually, the whole world is moving and the room isn't.
13the button isn't animating
13oh well
13ded
Welp

I remember when I first played Myst. . .-none- of the animations actually worked.
I'm an assasin, not a crazed gunman.
13ponies paying attention to how the room works?
Thunk
Nice i like how the whole room just rotates
No. :I
And a good many of the puzzles in it depended on working animations.
:O
well, that was easy
NUKE THE PLANET FROM ORBIT!
11,01A room works like this: You have four walls that hold a roof up.
And I -loathed- the spaceship piano note puzzle in Myst 1.
its the only way to be sure
11,01And usually an entryway of some sort in one of the walls.

How is Suicune pronounced? I always pronounce it weird
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-its-the-true.jpg
I think I would have to play myself in order to figure things out XD
probably, dunno
No questions asked.
That didnt sound good
*community

The whole point behind Myst and Riven is exploration and discovery, all while solving the puzzles that are litterred around the landscape.

SPEAK ENGLISH
Bomb?
oh
13not only is this teaching you the numbers, it's showing you the world
doesn't sound like just a permutated alphabet
Let me show you the world....
13rivenese kids learn the D'ni numbers with a toy that lowers people to their deaths
13how messed up is that
Heh
Well, no more messed up than us playing hangman.
Hangman extreme
11,01Shizuka: Teach 'em young.
Arrow = 8
Backwards h symbol

11,01You lose!
/me 13knows these by heart ofc
K is 2.
ofc?
ahh symbols in the bottom
133
KI is 2 right?
Line is 5
13this toy ends at 10
13but you have to learn up to 24
13there's a pattern
Arc on bottom: 10
laptop is 10
like roman numerals?
Cross is 6
Rice field is six.
Cross * Line = ?
window sihl is 6
13line in which direction :3
13i'll spoil for you, there are four digits, 1-4
Horizontal. Heh.
Horizontal line
ded
13rotate the digit 90 degrees and get that multiple of 5
11,01I WIN!
13so 5 is 1 turned on its side
136 is 5 + 1
I don't even
Figuring out these first 10 can get the full pattern of 24, essentially.
13I 1, DI 2, KI 3, r 4
That's a 7
Mind=Splattered across the wall.
Bow and Arrow be 7
13people also worked out the letters are based on the numbers
Or rather, 5 + 2.
13i used to have the letters memorized but not anymore
13yup
Remember? Nah.
I'm used to skyrim style puzzles...."follow the arrow!" "arrange the three symbols just like these three on the opposite wall!"....idiot puzzles

00,02Shizuka, find moah blue pages
Hi, Good afternoon everyone
13so if you recall, that symbol was 4
13which means something about the magical leopleurodon is 4
it wants sacrifices
:D
The order of a sequence of animal symbols later on?
the first thing that got the Title "Video Game" was Asteroids, but yes, there were games on electronic devices before that
Zuul

Good evening everypony
/me has no stream
11,01Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Is that a vidoe?
13it's more a pity i couldn't get ponies interested enough in uru live to put up with the friends list setup...
13i wanted to solve puzzles with ponies but noo...
11,01Shizuka: If only my computer worked.
shizu...i would of done it! or attempted to....
I...honestly would not have.
I like puzzle games it's the only thing that doesn't bore me
i would for a while.. then i would go crazy cause i'm not good with puzzles
Mostly because of the 'boring' thig.
thing*
11,01Same.
13uru is about the exploration though
13cool environments
...
WH4T NOW?
13uru live tried getting off the ground but ubi dropped them
13then they tried with gametap, actually got through some interesting content, then gametap dropped them
Hallo
Investigate pumpkin
Why does no one want to bring it back up?
13probably cause of how the content worked
13most of uru live is already available in uru the singleplayer (plus the two expansions)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uru:_Ages_Beyond_Myst <-- Uru
That must of hurt
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJyq1x-5nLA&feature=relmfu
13they knew it was coming, it was kind of a "get together for the end of the world" thing
wat r all of you beautiful folks up too hmm?
13when i tried getting people interested in january there were maybe 20 people in the public city instance
13which is about how it had always been
me neither
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-trouble-with-rhymes.png

Why not Ronbow Dosh?
11,01That's the 360's fault.
Why not Dolan?
I accidentaly turned it a bit while the disc was in it
11,01Oh.
It was Banjo and Kazzoie nuts and bolts
Never liked it anyway
Also whats the proper way to have it set up?
11,01It made me >.(\
Vertical or Horizontal?
11,01Either should work.
now
morrowind. yes or no on buying it
:) Thats why my last set of headphones only had 1 speaker working :P
11,01I guess.
11,01You shouldn't get scratches at all from play.

0,5Im actually on my friend's computer
I still think its poor design if a console cant handle being on for several hours
0,5Say hello if he ever comes in here ^_^
0,5>.>
I'm gonna turn on music it's too quiet in my home
11,01And that's why you don't buy a 360.
11,01Unless you like things that break.
This is also the issue with my Wii
11,01Of course, that joke may not apply anymore.
0,5...wat
And you don't buy a ps3 unles you like a station that sucks
11,01Dunno the fail rate of the slim models.
Actually the ps3 is a good console
Slim models?
Hallo
I havent had much of a problem with my 360 breaking - though it has froze a couple of times playing Skyrim

11,01I don't know.

http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-bronies-always-shine.jpg
I heard there are 360 pony skins - anyone know where I can find some?
11,01My PS3 has a custom pony theme.
Why the fuck would they even make a slim model
It cant even do things that require a hard drive
11,01No. The Rainbow Factory one.
Becaus they needed to keep us occupied untill the 720 comes out
oright
G'night everypony! :)
Whats going on?
It was to make a smaller and cheaper version
0,5Grimdark? I prefer clop.

Hey I just like the show and the community is totally normal. *sign in* "I clop to bacon"
11,01I should sell my 360.
0,5PLAY URU LIVE
No
I dont feel like it
Besides I doubt my comp can handle it
Really? Looked boring when I saw it.
11,01Bronysith: Coincidence.
0,5Yes you do
cool thanks
I'll jion. I just need to wait until my download is done

Ponies don't eat meat
What's URU live?
UTE live?
Wow sucks
You suck.
EVE > Wow
<.<
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-untitled1.jpg
I got from lvl 60 to lvl 80 in less than a month though
i've been playing 6 years, I can pretty much fly anything sub bs
oh sht i need to play rotmg
But that was because I had nothing to do
...
I highly doubt a MMO is gonna come along and keep me from playing WoW
/me hijacks stream.
training is not like wow
/me 11,01wishes his computer would start normally.
I'll stick to GW2. :P
Wut?
its time based, as in RL time based
You do, you just do it much much slower.
<.<
How does it start... er abnormally?
11,01No POST beeps during start-up.
11,01I can't afford to fix it.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzq8Xnk1Ga0&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577
I fail to see how learning things while not playing is a point in favour.
Its like tf2 idles
I fell asleep at my computer
Or apparently not even leave open
And you pay it to work.
=|
I certainly did. But I also tried it.
Eve was the best nap I ever had.
00,10enjoy http://tinyurl.com/84vquak
On my keyboard.
the thing is, EVE isnt really known for its mechanics as it is known on the community and how they USE said mechanics
EVE is a sandbox,
pure and simple
Eve, at least for me, is known for the epic back stabs that said community does to itself for isk. or wahtever.
Great community
there is no hand holding in EVE, like in wow, it is cutthoat and brutal
Wow isnt handholding
bullshit
I never had handholding when I play
riiiiight
it is imo
My old computer teacher beat it an one hour
Its called a quest moron
http://www.livestream.com/snappleshroom
I never had these "handholding" issues with WoW
level*
Cata came out the following chrismas
13:o
13yay~
Wrath babies talking about WoW not holding hands. Irooonnnyyyyyy.
13also yaaaaaaaaaaay i think... this latest patch talks about fireworks when you have all 12 sparklies... which i really really hope means they fixed the minkata sparkly
Hand holding isn't an issue, it's the opposite of one.
I have to sleep people, goodnight :F
Right..... sure....
11,01Have maidy dreams.
thats another thing
/me stretches
00,10then again you could also fit torps on a friggate and stack afterburrners on any ship
hello ~
hello
uhmmmmmmm
you arent ... powered by items and ships as much as you are by skill level (both in character and RL) skills in using said items and ships
When I levelled my rogue back in TBC I had to go find a bunch of schmucks to take down the Ghostlands elite abombs, now you can just zerg them. The world is less real and more streamlined and that's a sad thing.
see: failfits
like the ever popular failfit: Laser raven :)
Yes.;
Reality is MMO combat is all the same formula. Start hitting each other and whoever has the blastier gun wins.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzq8Xnk1Ga0&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577
I like EVE's music.
as I said, the real fun in EVE is playing with friends :)
kinda...
Playing anything with friends is more fun than playing it by yourself, that's applicable to anything.
It's ironic that I'd be the one to say that because I have no friends.
/me shrugpony.
All my friends are in my guild
goodnight everyone!
Still not sure if I should bother downloading this Uru thing
00,10http://images.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3667-1331797496419.gif
I don't mind puzzle games but only at my pace.
11,01Sumica: Same.
11,01My anxiety issues are preventing me from finding work sadly.
D:
00,10well it's kinda a lie cause i did go to work, but I daydreamed all day.
00,10nah I quit that job
He lives in Vegas, ofc he works at a casino.
00,10i am a Baker now
That's all they have in Vegas.
Working at a casino doesnt sound as fun as it should be
Don't listen to him, he's lying. In Vegas they eat poker chips.
00,10I was a cook
11,01Too afraid to work. Fucking horrible.
/me eats the chips
I'm being ignored by automated responses.
^When isn't it
When it's cold?
Good grief!
11,01Meanwhile: Not saying that people want me.
110 degrees? That's BOILING!
00,10the radient heat on the strip is 125 right now
They're gonna need one heck of an AC unit over there.
Or rather, 110 K? You might as well move to Antarctica.
They need the S.H.I.E.L.D Helicarrier to fly over them.
11,01I'm too terrified to go to a temp agency. Fucking stupid.
It's pretty easy to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, but STILL.
11,01Just the weather patterns favoring a hot pattern.
Its been hot, but not THIS hot
11,01Redundant statement.
11,01Yeah. Heat's making the news.
11,01Warm winter and hot summer.
32 = 0, 50 = 10, 68 = 20, 86 = 30.
iits been up to 100 here in wisconsin
Warm winter, rainy cold summer here.
104 = 40.
Geeze, you guys are in an oven.
This isnt normal
It's currently 17 Celsius, which makes it about 61-62 Fahrenheit here.
Whoops, my weather didn't update since June.
It's currently about 70 degrees.
its 90 here
MYAAH
Oh my
