it could do anything like change color species stats etc
I only have three

mhm
Oh that really expensive one?

wheel of extravagance
I was going to try it, but the wheels usually rip me off

Especially the wheel of Knowledge
I hate that one
I actually do alright on that one sometimes

it's strangely addicting
yeah it is
I always lose money from those
yeahh
there's 2 avs for it too

one of them you get randomly when you score 24 points

you barely have to do anything
it's the equivalent of watching a pet goldfish swim around and feed it 3 times a day but still sitting there watching it for 24 hours
pretty much
I just leave it on whenever I have my computer on
I wish I had more trophies :(
which explains why the neofriends list thing says I've been online for like 5 hours
XDD
yup
is it just me or is neopets not loading userlookups?
It seems extra slow today
Was playing with that akinator thing earlier today with my sister.
I thought it had to be a character :P
It can be pretty much anything that's alive.
omg

O_o hahaha
LOL
luv bellsprout
Oh Spyroforum
Could not connect to the database
Hahaha.
that used to happen ALL THE TIME
SR probably decided "Why am I losing money on this?".
And downgraded the hosting.
Maybe he did something weird
He just banned "*".
XD
lol
haha
figures
he cares very deeply about his investments
LOL fail.
nice
well
now he has something else to deal with
I was going for scyther, and it came up with rayquaza.
I said if anyone complains it's not my fault
He said if anyone complains I should tell them to email no-reply@spyroforum.com
7Blame a lack of TST for my presence. :P
...
Wow.
That's a bit harsh.
10So TST's servers are down? Or is it just my computer?
When he wants to do something there's really no persuading him any other way
Unless you want a huge argument
7It's TST in its entirety.
7Unless we're both facing the same problem.
And he blamed all the arguments on me. right
lol I can't connect either
www.spyroforum.com
Oh, that explains it
He's moving the database server
Somewhere cheaper? :P
I think bradsbox.com is his own host
it's been there
thought it was already there
he thinks the Mysql is just malfunctioning
ohh
yeah, i misread that
Anyone could click the link and tell him it's down
:#
hi
Hi
7O_o
7What server are they connecting to?
7I tried both island and ocean.
10Island
/me 7tries Island again.
7Nope.
03Sigh
03I hate products that can't be found anymore
03no?
Sky can't connect
(Skylands that is)
02I'm connected through ocean, I think.
Hmm
/me hugs Sky :3
10!sneas
8yo
6...Bristle was here earlier, but he kinda disappeared before I noticed him...
8oh
8yeah, i talked to him in a thread earlier
8he'll be here this week
6Cool.
6lol I could have sworn you guys said he was halfop.
8i thought he was
6Nope.
8isnt he?
8weird
6I can still see it on my screen.
6Oh, wait.
6Looking at the wrong line.
6>>;
6He's halfop.
6I need to stop coding this freaking RP site. Like now. >>;
6I'm making a site for an RP that me and my local friends are doing.
8oh, cool
8lol, to me it would all seem tedious
8and most other people
7On another note, it's going to be >95 degrees Fahrenheit tomorrow and the day after. O.i
7O.o*
8no probz
6...one of my friends just complained to me that they don't like the standard layout of the website.
6I am NOT coding a forum skin. NOT going to happen.
6gtg talk later dude
6Probably bbs
03:3
o_O
lolwut?
Quite surprising to see you here o_O
7Hey, NS.
7Blame TST for being down. :P
Yeah I saw you say that ;p
weird
a lot of people can't connect
!check lugia.us
Oh
It's not just you! http://lugia.us looks down from here.
DNS is down
7Yep.
72.20.16.202
or that for ocean
7Either or both?
either
first one is island second is ocean
derp
7Meep.
7Danke.
no problems
anyway
10Neither of those work, NS
7Worked for me. O_o
!dns 72.20.16.202
Resolved 72.20.16.202 to: ocean.lugia.us
lol reverse DNS
but it does/should work
if all else fails you could try a BNC or mibbit
10Tried Mibbit
http://www.mibbit.com/chat?server=67.21.84.209:6667
er
http://02.chat.mibbit.com/?server=67.21.84.209:6667&nick=Skylands
7There you go.
I'm hoping that works but I don't have mibbit access atm, school is a bitch
hurp
10Still strange how mIRC won't connect
try go to cmd and type ipconfig /flushdns
and then try connect with mIRC
lmao
tor doesn't work
I'm here now
Then you're doing it wrong. :P
oh trust me, my school blocks a lot of shit
10[19:11] * Connecting to ocean.lugia.us (6667) - [19:11] * Unable to resolve server
10When I try both Island and Ocean
then find a tor IP that's not blocked and then try use it
lol you're doing it wrong
Pfft, they can't block everything.
-> /server 67.21.84.209
TST's domain is down atm
thus the subdomains direct nowhere
!dns island.lugia.us
Heya Sky :3
Unable to resolve island.lugia.us
10Hm
Just set up a DNS server, then it doesn't matter. :P
lol
Her FF broe
Ohaiu :3
they use NTLM authentication and shits
hurp
03dhki
10Thanks NS
I told her to do that too
But it didn't work o.o

7To satiate a mental fixation for IRCs, I suppose. :P
We watched that and "A Fistful Of Dollars".
7I've been here before, if you don't know.

heya
Hi
lol macintrash.
thankfully i managed to fix it with some help from a friend
wtf
:D
8welcome back
Oh no, syrup everwhere.
Yeah?
because I have bind9 set up on one of my servers
which has a /64 of IPv6
Magical configness.

well
I think I have the configs and everything done okay
but does IPv4 work together with it?
okay
ty
02woohoo. Ocean died.
02(at least to me)
the DNSes are just <censored> up
Please do not swear. You have sworn 15 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
6Especially now that I have food. XD
oh
fffffff
go away
03sigh
03finding motherboards and RAID cards eis like
heya drf
03work
TST's DNSes got mauled ;;
:<
Whyy ;.;
site's server is down
The example config file on that site has both IPv4 and 6 zone files.
anyway
and for the first time like, island has more people on it than ocean rofl
/me poofs
02lmfaO.
02caps. lol
02lmfao*
okay thanks
well
it's not fucking up bind9 that I'm worried about
because configuring it isn't that hard
it's just after I get the VPS provider to switch the nameservers, if mine isn't configured properly then it's screwed
If I remember right I had to pastebin ~10 different files for you. :P
yeah pretty much
I had to configure bind9 for Altair's server as his router was being a cock
causing problems for ZNC and IRC
uh, unrealircd
that'd be nice
I'm more concerned about whether I'd fuck everything up
8nice
and if I don't configure my shit correctly it won't work very well
8it was only like 90 when i left work
there's something like...18 quintillion. yeah, I REALLY want to submit 18 quintillion support tickets lol
Hahahaha.
6It's about 90 here.
8i would be jelly if i didnt have a/c
6But you're further south. IIRC
8it hit 101 here
6...I have no reaction image for this.
8ah
8literally the only positive thing about living in the dorms
8i dont have to pay for utilities
8im excited to leave here
I think they'd get pissed at me
o.O
I think dragonite died
I had to sign in via shaymin
6Wow... that... kinda sucks.
probably
yeah, probably
8yeah
8only for 2 months though
[00:30] Closing link: (king_dari@xx.xx.xx.xxx) [Server shutdown]
8and its only $600 for the summer
oh
It just doesn't
Yeah, mine just says [18:33:57] ->> Connection closed from dragonite.irc.epic-chat.net
dumb icechat
same
mIRC > all :P
well yeah, probably
I don't want to pay for it though :P
6That's not bad at all.
It's free.
I downloaded it once
It kept bugging me to pay $30 or something
It has a guilt 'please buy license' message when you open it.
it was annoying
Since I hardly ever have to open it, no problems there.
8yeah
8its a place to sleep and surf ponychan, thats really all i need right now
8fair enough lol
6I can sleep standing up.
04mew
6During trig.
6Was awesome.
8wut
8how
8i dont even...
6For like, five minutes.
6One day, teacher told me to stand in the back of the room, wasn't allowed to lean against the wall.
6Five minutes later she yelled at me and woke me up.
8lol
8that'll teach em
6After that she just left me alone.
6That was about a month into the school year.
6That's pretty awesome.
8funny story, he's now an assistant principal in charge of discipline at my former high school
6That's beyond awesome.
8im trying to find a version of part of my trip that is case sensitive
8 117 million trips and no hits yet
6lulz
6I'm STILL trying for an AB trip.
8I'm trying to get MPPony
6Oh.
03hi
6I can probably get that for you.
8because MPP stands for merriweather post pavilion, which is my favorite album of all time, and pony because ponies
8what do you mean you can get it for me?
6Does it have to be aligned to the left?
8nah, just anywhere
6My tripcode explorer runs INCREDIBLY fast.
8ah
6What's yours up to?
8 119 million
8oh wow
6Yeah.

8i feel like an idiot
6Nothing to slow it down.
6Just hit 200M
8ah
8ive pretty much just constantly added shit and never deleted anything
6I've had this about the same time.
6Yeah... mine was like that a month ago.
6I also run a bunch of searches at once.
6So, yeah.
8lol
036y5p
6I actually have a few Rainbow ones...
6No Dash... I should add that to the list...
6lol I got an all lowercase mppony.
8already?
8damn
6I'm not running it case sensitive because I'd lose out on other trips I'm searching for.
6I've got 5 mppony ones, but only one that's not mishmashed with the capitalization, and that's the all lowercase one.
6lol MPPoNY
8so close
8also, this is my favorite spiderman pic now: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/src/130749265341.png

The acting was pretty superb. I'm finding it difficult not to spoil anything right now.
/me points a finger at Aero
YOU again
I hate all of you
ME
haha
YOU
We hate you too
thanks
:D
Do you hate Xmen too?
MEEE
Why do you hate use now?
us*
We're not even talking about ponies.
FO SHO
:P
COOLIO
heard it was decent
I haven't seen any of them
dari: for RDX hate means he thinks we're cool
yes yes
*mutant
I just have a hard time taking anything with the name "X-men" seriously to be honest"
my mentality is very backwards sometimes
I dunno
LOL
*males to females
X-Humans
XD
Wii-U looks AWFUL.
I want one
really?
Sorry, had to burst that out.
o.o
I think it looks epic
I tihnk it looks cool
Looks, yes.
cool, epic
Functions the same if not worse than current consoles.
still looks oold though
idc
oh
I read it too fast
Hey
then yes I did hear that
Not sure about Xbox
and don't really care either
Xbox isn't. Kinect was all they needed.
yeah
They plan to just keep updating the same console.
Yeah
crap.
Nintendo's the only one upgrading
At least in that tiny area.
aggreed
The Wii could use an update though
Definitely
they have the online ability that can be used to update
LOL
epic SR quote for sure
same here
not in epic-chat
[21:24:58] <+Aristeo> Yeah
[21:25:11] <+spyrorocks> crap.
Haha
but they make great games for them
:O Great games? I can count on one hand the titles I actually like for Wii...
Just doesn't want to?
Pretty much everyone bought a wii (good for Nintendo), but I find that most people stopped using theirs after less than a year.
I don't get it
that supports the forum
hm
They seemed like a good idea, but when it comes down to it for 'proper' games, I just prefer a normal controller.
And he's fixing it for him
Thank you, Dari. xD
Lol
Like he'd ever be humble enough to admit something like that
most likely not
I'm just saying that there are still a lot of good games on the Wii despite that
I just... can't agree to that.
but still
sure not many, if any, good hardcore games
Yeah
but sometimes I want something that's just fun
The Wii is just fun
without being taken seriously
It's like Spyro
right
Are games ever to be taken seriously?
I think some are
I don't play too many of those
*even
well, me too
but I do the same with books and movies
I still take them seriously though
but you can still take them somewhat seriously at the same time
yeah
that's the part I tend to not take seriously
:P
multiplayer I treat as one of those "just for fun" aspects of gaming
About time
Dragonite is always the one that dies
well
04meow
doubt it
my K/D ratios tend to suck
but they don't mean anything to me really
Yeah, I was being sarcastic.
or doesn't see any "gain" in doing it
haha
IT'S NOT A TUMOR
Do andriods dream of them?
*androids
computer dreams supposedly
oh no
jk
http://electricsheep.org/
whatever
That's the book Blade Runner is based on...
Kind of looks like weird fractals.
I got it on two of my computers now
How many do you have?
XD
four
with one that doesn't work
O_o
I have two
I have one...
I is jealous
two desktops and three notebooks
jeeze
And I thought my two were excessive
XD
There are 4 in the house, only 1 that I own though.
lol
I counted up all the computers in our house once
dari: same here
I think there were 8
not counting my dad's smartphone
O_o
well if I count for us
we have...
actually wait
11
only 3 in this house
one being mine
Yeah
O_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________o
Where are the others?
I only know of yours, Evan's, the one by the TV, and the work one
that makes 5
MONDAY, MONDAY, MONDAY
GRAVE DIGGER
he grabed wepon
I have one
and one desktop
Oh wait, there's actually 5 in the house.
but he's only home on weekends
No one else uses it
I can't remember why, but there's something I dislike about laptops.
17 inchers are not bad
yeah, that's like mine
my Asus is 17.3
If I would have known that I didn't NEED a laptop for college like they say I'd have gotten a desktop instead
largest one I could find
It's weird going from using the netbook for a while back to using this one
"this screen is tiny" "this screen is huge"
Compared to 30" they are.
Why would you need a 30" monitor?
that's bigger than most TVs
[21:41] <~Stormy> Why would you need a 30" monitor?
PONIES
Oh, it's only 27".
Haha
Well still
any more than that and I start to get overwhelmed anyway
I can barely have two conversations at once on MSN
As it is I have about 40 tabs and 10 things open.

Unfortunately I can't understand a word of it because it's all Japanese
I'm seriously considering getting a PS3 now
thanks to E3
I should have waited to get one
this is the first time I've ever seen it
my older model doesn't
I want to get one too
PS3 got some good exclusives? I'm surprised.
They didn't always?
It was always about the exclusives!
inFamous, Resistance, etc.
no it isn't
oh
damn
I have my old PS2
I still use that
My PS3 is backwards compatible. >:P
We'll trade you!
How else can I play my darling Spyro?
mine isn't though
RDX: only the old models are
the very old ones
oh well
I still have my PS2
that's good enough for me
I think 20, 40, and 60 GB ones were
well then mine might be
After that they stopped making them backwards compatible with PS2
but I only use it for PS3 games and Blueray
Oh, the first ones, yeah.
But they're still backwards compatible with PS1
=/
Even then, they weren't BC with /every/ title.
really?
I never heard that
me neither
thought that was only the 360 that did that
Same.
Got my PS2.
About 95%, but a few of my games happened to not work.
http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/747-rejuvenated-sony-shows-off-games-lineup-prices-ps-vita-under-250Stormy:
I still have a PSX and PS2
But I'd rather just have one console
Evidently I had some obscure titles.
oops
I don't think it mattered which title it was
http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/747-rejuvenated-sony-shows-off-games-lineup-prices-ps-vita-under-250
It had the actual PS2 hardware
Not all of them did. They used an adapter after the first year.
Oh, yeah, I'm talking about the first ones
I guess PS2 hardware wasn't worth the cost to them.
I still never heard of that adapter though
seriously?
Me too
Got any sources?
Let me confirm that.
I always thought the 360 was the only console that was ever selectively backwards compatible
Not really interested in the Vita
me neither
PSP never interested me either
What's the vita?
LOL
"Undaunted by its recent rough ride at the hands of hackers"
Oh please
don't try to tell us it "wasn't anonymous" again
"SUESUESUESUESUESUESUESUE"
it looks exactly like the PSP, but with a touchscreen and some social networking feature
the Vita I mean
Yeah, social networking thing is meh
If it
*it's optional, I'll ignore it
but it'll still be annoying that it's there
If it's not optional... even less interested
I hate to cite wikipedia, but I'm lazy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_games_incompatible_with_PlayStation_2
They had no reason to sue. They sued some harmless homebrew developers. They sued all of Team Fail0verflow for hacking the console when they didn't even release their hacks.
I thought someone got a hold of something they weren't supposed to have had
They own the console.
They never agreed no to.
not*
...
as well as money
In fact, there was a clause originally that actually said they could do whatever they wanted.
Yeah, and that too
No money.
To protect their customers' identities
Someone hacked PSN, and stole all the details (probably not credit card details).
Oh yeah, they released all the information didn't they?
it's like a witch hunt if you ask me
I think I saw it on their site.
Ostensibly, yeah.
It wasn't.
I don't see why it's them who're the bad guys, and not the hackers
Unfortunately I found that link from Spyroforum
They removed otherOS.
An advertised feature.
They got sued in several places for that.
That's not right.
Whoever was the culprit of the "hacking" should be thanked, given nothing has been stolen.
they brick modded consoles
This wasn't a modded console.
They weren't using hacks online.
They hadn't entered into any agreements.
When geohot released CFW he even disabled something to stop piracy.
....
I never heard that
pretty sure they can't do that
No one can do that
They did.
that makes no sense
One person.
Uh, no, I was just saying that hoping for clarification
making sure I got it right
Dari, do you have any news articles or anything confirming all of this?
Sure.
but nothing about them abusing anyone's rights
Let me find the one about google/youtube.
11.•10«11WB10 (TR_Reed10) 11WB10»11•. 10- * TR_Reed wants a pony
but
they sued and did everything to not allow piracy
But piracy is an assumption.
and showed others how to do the same
Team Fail0verflow didn't even release any of their work and they got sued, I'm fairly sure.
jailbreak is needed for piracy
He released a jailbreak for iPods.
That's legal.
"and now the PlayStation 3 jailbreak"
Makes sense to me
I'm not familiar with a jailbreak
I honestly don't know
That's the whole point of it.
Personal experimentation. There are far more legal applications of a jailbroken console.
Minus pirating
Well, as long as it's legal.
Which people were apparently doing because of this
I'm not saying they handled it the right way
That's hardly the fault of the defendants.
It is his fault for putting it out there, is probably how they saw it
if it wasn't there, people couldn't do that
you're pluralizing defendents
He never suggested piracy.
Not how it is
Still got sued.
But it's a shortsighted view, and everyone should be clear on that.
Nothing.
Fairly sure geohot released the information.
They still all got sued.
how can you hack and do nothing?
there had to have been something
04http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/060/1/5/silver_used_lick__free_icon__by_anonislove-d3aokic.gif <-- DID NOT EXPECT.
Modifying a console is not wrong. Modifying it for illicit purposes is.
OK, I think I've got it now
That's as condensed as I can make it.
They shouldn't have sued
But I still see where there were coming from
Since people were using that tool to do something illegal
honestly
I know a few people with homebrew for their DS
they all use it for pirated games
not my point
Yes, I get it
I said that already
Sheesh
Blarg?
Well, piracy should be the ultimate evil.
we're not ignoring it
To be honest I laughed hard when I found out that PSN had been hacked, even though that was my information stolen.
well have fun
g'night folks
Cya.
night RDX
Night
same here
I heard both sides of the story
neither really in depth
and I beleived the side in Sony's defense a bit more
it still makes sense to me
Homebrew is awesome anyway. HD shaders on the Atari, SNES, and even a NDS emulator soon to be released.
I still agree with their reasoning though
Good night.

04Oh
yeah
04I did A=1, B=1
I think I got it wrong ;;
same
04I'm pretty sure that was right
but all my friends put A=0, B=1
or whatever, the other way round
04Because then it's equal 0 which would equal 1 which would equal 0 or w/e
oh well
yeah
04It's was confusing.
;p
04I was trying not to let my mind wander.
04ffs my story is finally progressing.

all she needs is foolish burial and that other card, forgot its name

hi uxie
Hey aggelos_the_dragon
hi
i didnt regognize you with that name
Heh
yeah
It really does look that way.
i think that spyro is a bit ugly
hi dari
:(
lol
Hey.
he doesnt talkkkkkkkk
i dont like it already
Well we don't really now
i feel like spyro doesnt excist anymore
It still has yet to come out
13Hi!
hi
13What you oui mean?
13No trashing SSA, Dari!
4http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Zap
4And maybe many more
13Cool!
It looks fugly too.
Why would I want to play as another character anyway?
4I would man
03gcg
4Now i can play with friends i beat the crap out of Spyro or play as a team
13So, duu!
call me crazy but i think spyro is alive and he is in heaven lol
uxie for the first time dari is right.they make spyro ugly and just like the 32 other characters.spyro sopposed to be special do you agree?
13Crid ib!
13Learn by playing FFX or FFX-2, unless you think they are ugly!
I don't play/like FF games.
13Unsure
how can you be unsure?
13E tuhd ghof
4They need online
...Online? In Spyro?
13Yep
>__>
13Not that oui care!
Well that isn't the worst idea I've heard today.
Oh wait, it is.
:P
4No
it going to be like world of warcraft?
Meteors could be fun, you never know.
13Heartless
:) looooool
4-Not sure
4But if you want you can play online in pvp or story mode or random levels
do you believe that spyro is alive and that it lives. i believe it.am i crazy?
I wish they would just let it die. They've ground his name into the dirt. :P
13Did not!
4PvP would be fun
4Pawning the S*** out of noobs
4getting pawned
4Playing with friends
4Co-op levels
i feel that spyro is my friend.because when i was a kid no one has given me attention.so i was playing spyro in ps1
4I can now play with friends
4Aw
4Well try this
4See?
4Watching sure
4Being a part of sure
4Being a cartoon is another story
13True
13True
13It would be good
why did insomniac sell spyro?
6i have plentyyyy of ideas
13Same here
6nice
13I just wish I worked for Insomiac at the time...
6ey i just wrote that
13Opps, cunno!
[15:38] <aggelos_the_dragon> why did insomniac sell spyro? They never owned the intellectual property to him.
They didn't have a choice to make more games (not that I think they would have).
13They created that series, Dari!
I know, but they didn't own the idea.
13I cannot ether. I live in Australia
Saw it somewhere on an insomniac forum, I'll try and find it for you.
6you have more chances to work to insomniac
UxieLover1994: see this http://www.insomniacgames.com/community/index.php?topic=40603.0;wap2
13Cool!
"Right now Sierra owns Spyro. Sierra chooses developers to work with the Spyro IP. Even though Insomniac created the Spyro IP they don't have ownership to it."
6then why they say that spyro is insomniacs maskot?
13I know! Do you HATE ME, Dari!?
Ratchet and Clank are more insomniac's mascot, and they still don't own them.
Why would I hate you?
13Because we think differently
4I want to work for the curret holder of spyro
13When why are we always fighting?
4If i worked for them i would make a comic for a few things
6not again
4Maybe tie in a few things
4And make a plot
4about the reboots
4as one
6i now know one thing
4?
4Whatcha coming down with??
4aw
6im sad
4?
6:(
6for spyro
4Whats wrong?
13I've lost my voice
6call me crazy but i think that spyro is in heaven
/me 4jumps in a window
6lol
6is this bad?
4Yes
/me 4pulls out his guns
6?
4Well first
4you think Spyro is heaven
4Cult
4ou think whe ou die ou wil go there
4CUT
4*cult
4Cult
4>.>
4He died?
4You first
13Didn't you guts see the last scene in DotD?
6oh
4I did
4Not really
6thats ok you are not the only one
4He is then trapped and another him in a whole another world is made
4After that another one is made
4For Skylanders
4This one has 31 friends
4See theres going to be a army
4And there friends
4For a battle with Evil
13I think I need to undergo surgery. I can taste blood
6you just made a plot
4O.O
4Yes i did
4Uxie docter now
4Now Uxie don't say no
4See my plot would be cool
4It would tie in everything
6i made my first plot when i was 3 years old lol
4We have them all the time
6what time is in australia right now?
4Plus we have 911
13 12:30am
4And phones for nine one one
4Heck we have them all the time
6here is 18:08
4So Aggelos do you like my plot?
4It's 9:09 am here
6yeah
4My plot would bring back the three spyros
4And his friends
6but this plot is for TLoS
4No it's for all
4Second he ends up with Cynder
6of coursw
4Third he is a hero of many lands
13It's not deadly. I'll be alright
6course
4So a comic should have the second and third finding out about this
4And then meeting each other
4You know bring back evryone for one last fight
4Then you can let it go from there
6yeah its nice
!isukra
:(
6(i cant remember his name)
6 6ekana metafrasi
6translation doesnt work
13Agent 9. That's his name
Eh i'm guessing it ended with me leaving and then our friend leaving
13Well, I'm probabally going to take time off
03:3
ok
13You know, to get some rest
13Okay
ok
Sleep well
13Gracias! Night!
Night

!espeon
Floofcat!
Yeah, pretty much.

14majorily
;p
http://steamcommunity.com/id/floofcat/ <- oO
14~
Was pretty cool.
/me noms on Espeon
What's with the My Little Pony craze?
!may
14I dunno
14prolly 'cause they look more animeish
I just like the cartoon, I don't know.
14I prefer the old-fashioned sparkle-your-skin versions of them |D
arti dont come here anymore?
liez
Oh great
May: Really? Most people react to <G4 ponies with "KILL IT WITH FIRE!". :P
^
14Yeah
The old ones?
g4?
G4 are the newest ones.
The earlier ones kind of scare me.
why are ppl obsessed with ponies
14no, G5 is the newer
14I thought it was
You sure? I'm 99% sure it's G4 latest.
14Charizard, I dunno, it's a craze I guess
Yeah, FIM is G4.
Spike, yeah.
that it is
14I just like all of them except the G2 and G1 series
14I played with them when I little
14so
Lol, most of the fans are 18-34.
thats a shame
14lol that's why people collect them
Someone posted a good CS Lewis quote recently, let me find it.
14like they do with beanie babies
CS Lewis was a pro. :P
LOOK AT ME
Maybe I should be less embarassed about myself still liking a few things from my childhood
14There's a stamp I like, it says "Cartoons. Consider this, ADULTS make 'em."
Not just Pokémon
anyone?
/me coughThomasTheTankEnginecoughcoughcough

14People don't care, a lot of times people agree with me
14Yeah
14to strangers

8Oh
8i meant to ask you
8do you think i should but up the selection thread tomorrow to give people more time to enter?
weren't we going to have the selection live, though?
8right
8but
8we still need to have people enter, and it's easier for me if we do it as a selection thread
I see
8we'll just say you have to be present to win
have the OFFICIAL ENTRIES in the thread
I see
that said
8ballot?
whatever you use for the random selection
since it's gotta be streamed live and all
8i just put them in a list organizer and randomize it, there's not really anything to watch
8plus, if we did it that way, it would show all the winners at once, and that houldn't be very dramatic
there's a way to work through that
and I thought we were doing it that way to prevent accusations of foul play?

okay
this seems like the best way
just zooming in seems to work wonders
just gotta set up a borderline

there
makes for an exciting method
for the viewers, I mean
might actually help increase viewership a bit

12I no wanna kill dragons D:
6Yet you kill puppys?
I think maybe not all of them try to kill you, they hinted that.
12I kill puppies no more
6:O
That'd make consoles 20% cooler.
My Little Pony.

6I want to.. :P
12D:
6:P
6And MW2..
8eh, it happens
6Yeah..I took a liking to it..
12Transformers war for cybertron is pretty fun
I really loved MW2 to be honest.
6MW3 looks kinda cool
Apart from zombies, that was fun.
6Yeah,I prefered MW2 too..
6Zombies scared the shit out of me when they crept up behind me..
Hacks on MW2 were fun as well.
6I generally just liked MW2 more..Idk why..
Awesome.
Quickscope lobbies were the best part though.
Hey
6I need to get out of my camping habits on CoD.. -.-

6So far I've only played DMs and something with bombs..
Probably demolition.

YEAH well you're an ~adult~
School's out and still no job

I don't get why they put them in.
12Whenever I play online I commit suicde for fun
If you could shoot while diving it'd be fun.
Yeah.
6I was wondering about that..So you can only shoot once you've hit the ground?
6:O I never got something telling me how to do it on PS3.. o.o
You hold the crouch button to do it.
While running.
6Aaah..Maybe I'll get to try it at somepoint..Normally shouldn't it tell you in Campaign Mode how to do it or something?
04hihi
Probably does, can't remember.
6Indeed
I just don't really like the online.
03http://i.imgur.com/f9jCV.jpg
6I didn't get too much of the online actually..
6-.-
I probably played zombies more than normal online.
Oh, lol.

hi hi
Hello everypony!
hello?
yo
8sorry, was commenting on a ponychan thread
LOL
Depends
she openly swears and does nothing but annoy people
ok, haha I'm having a friend over and were going to watch them (While I passively mod)
She's not really doing anything wrong
8nice
8im going to be struggling to stay awake
8i have to be up at 6 am on saturday to run a football camp
Yeah, if she lets the filter catch it
there's never been a rule against that
Eh
Do you want to run the camp or are you being forced? haha
8kind of both
I don't find her annoying for some reason
8i want to run it, but i dont want to wake up that early on a saturday
Usually I think those kinds of people are annoying
I have no idea why I don't feel the same about her =/
Well it's not really a huge reason to be annoyed
I honestly shouldn't care
I don't think she's ever posted a single relevant post. Lawl.
8next weeks BMN i should say
but eh, that's prolly just cause the forum is boring
yeah
Spyroforum is also kind of known for having hard-ass mods
I just dont' see any point in which she is relevent about anything
I've seen her make on-topic posts
Obnoxious, sure, but keep in mind I was friends with SFRB
8btw, you know about the change in our selection format, right?
Can't get much more obnoxious than that
but not much I can do
8we are doing the selection for next week live during intermission tomorrow
8the entry thread is already up
I see, Live huh? Thats gonna be intense
whats going on in here? Mumble is down =(
I know Treesap, IKNOW!
8hi treesap
hi
oh my thunderstorms
everywhere!
Thunderstorms? and why is the Mumble down?
6Hey
7Suddendly color
6Yeah, I saw.
it was too long to type in here.
8lol
hi
6Apparently the mods don't want ponychan becoming all about them.
8fair enough
hi
6Whereas !!Rarity sat in one thread banning people for three hours straight.
6I saw.
how r u?
6And planned to be there anyway.
6I was going to suggest that...
03*WB02(Kyu02)03WB* - <Kyu> 07you all suck XD
8cool beans
8lol
8you saw mine, right?
6Yeah.
8before the last one
6Ghosties!
4We can never have a set time for meetings lol
6Never.
6Meetings here are 20% more sporadic.
8thats just how we roll
?
4...who are the rest of these people?
8*ponyshrug*
8pallaskitten has been doing the dari lurk all week
8dari is... well... dari
6Indeed.
4Well, as long as Lemmy is playing
4I don't mind
i havent
darilurk?
4But dari is the chatroom
oh, okay
4But we don't talk about that
8dari is never not in the chatroom
4Pretty much
6Well, there was that one time his computer got unplugged.
4Nah, I was around
4dari has powers, man
6Magic powers.
6That allow him to post in RAINBOW.
4Yes
i got her right 4 thime gessing
4*bastard
8even though he's half-op
4Pretty much
8curse that man and his knowledge of computers
he' sprolly using some mIRC script
8if it was posted after 10:30, i probably didnt see it
4Ah
6He is, pallas
8like a 10 commandments type of deal
6Oo
6Where?
8his 1st one is "love and tolerance. But remember, tolerance of intolerance is intolerance itself"
6Must. See. This.
4I actually added to the "commandments"
6Thread is tl;dr
6But looks interesting.
iv got a hawk orded :)
8i lost the thread
6Info fail!
8ghosties, i'll be here this week
4Oh, well, I feel like a dunce.
4But at least my prayers were in the right place
4Oh, Hip, I thought you had work tomorrow till like 10 PM?
8nah, next week
4Alright
8success
4What was the argument about?
4If I may ask
6Did you create a knifegun?
7Spiderman solves all problems
8it was about the proper role of government in the united states
8and i successfully derailed it with a "what the fuck am i reading?" image and two "nope" images
6That was slightly insulting.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OylhEA6Xx4Q LOL!
6And only slightly.
8it was a little like "awww, isn't that cute, they like ponies"
8but i like the publicity
4Perhaps it's not people, perhaps it's the media
6It really is media, for the most part.
8i was fine with it
how have they made it public? I haven't seen it anywhere
8i assume you're talking about the shout out in equestria girls
4Equestria Girls
except equestria girls
but even that was just one word
4Not just one word
4It was "bronies" and "DJ-P0N 3"
7 2 words
7bam
4Still, all I wanted was a discreet little merch bump
4Exactly
6Even before the extended.
8im fine with it
8im glad they acknowledge us
6I am too, it's all the media publicity that's related to it that I have an issue with.
8bristle, agreed
8i dont really care if it's discreet or not
4All I wanted was like cloths merch from Hasbro's site
4*clothes
4I didn't need them shoving Katy Perry in my face
7I already have a shirt haha, but its from ShirtBrony
4I never once said that them not acknowledging us equals no season 3
6CNN seeing it and getting all their info wrong = very bad
8lol
7*now*
6That's my main issue with the shoutout.
8also, i loved huffpo reporting that the presentation was done by "stephen magnet"
7CNN doesnt give to shits about us, like they would take the time to get good info
7*Two shits
6CNN doesn't get good info about ANYTHING EVER.
7Agreed
4It's gonna be Fox and 4chan all over again
6Precisely my point.
4My point is that there was no tact with Hasbro's shout out, that's all. They weren't thinking about the repercussions of announcing us to the rest of North America would be like
6"They're going to "love and tolerate" us, all right. WITH BOMBS!"
7How did they find out our plan?
7And then.....Fire
4The fandom is gonna explode one day
6We're a cult following according to wikipedia.
7What do you mean....Explode?
wb Sky :3
6Explode and then explode again!

10Thanks

4I'm waiting for the day when convenience stores in a low income country won't allow a male over the age of 18 to buy from them if they like ponies
6...anti-pony laws XD
/me hugs Espeon
hi
4I didn't think we'd ever see Mexico submit to a national holiday of openly beating emo people in the streets, but that happened too
/me hugs Obsi! :3
7Mexico has a holiday of beating the shit out of emo's?
I do not like Skylanders:Spyro's Adventure
6Win.
6Also, wtf Mexico?
Cynder isn't in there.Spyro cant talk,Spyro is MUTATED
4...hmm, okay, it wasn't all of Mexico. But there were supposedly anti-emo groups beating emo people in the streets in Tijuana
8tijuana is a ridiculous place to begin with
4That's still bad, though
8im not sure that place has any laws
8bristle: win
4I agree, I don't like emos either but I don't go around beating them up for it
6brb guys, getting more food and I can't exactly leave my comp unattended in a cafe...
7Well yeah I don't beat them, but why do you think that were going to get beatin up? i mean just wut? I live in Ohio, there are no crazy Mexicans here
7We can hope....
04Hi Espy
8me too
7:D
6WHOA
6lulz
4All I'm saying is that I really hope our community doesn't become the target of wide scale rebellion
4That's all
6I doubt it highly.
6The only people that really even slightly dislike us are the insecure idiots on 4chan.
6Everypony else either doesn't care or generally likes us.
lol
Lawl rage.
4...maybe.
4*shrugs*
Why do people think we like spyro?
06~~
6Also, again, brb getting food. For realz this time.
4My best friend hates the show and probably hates the fandom
7*Bye*
8only a handful know i have even watched an episode

8i dont have the balls to do that
4There's no way I'd do that
o.o
/me flees again
8honestly, the only thing i would buy that i wouldnt care at all if anyone saw would be a large rainbow dash plushie

7Sure she can ride a scooter, but that personality
4What of it?
4She's a tomboy
04yes |D
4Possibly Tsundere
:P
7Fight time? Fight time.
4One of the biggest reasons why RD was my favorite pony at first is because she's Tsundere
4Tsundere means cold at first and generally unlikeable
4And that's why she was my favorite at first
8Dash is my favorite, i dont know why
CURSE YOU BRAIN YOU FAIL ME AGAIN!
8possibly because shes an athlete, and i'm in to sports
7I Heart Pinkie Pie
ty
8pinkie pie annoys the ever loving shit out of me
7Mad?
7Mad.
8she reminds me sooooooo much of the sorority girls on campus here
6I am Pinkie Pie, irl.
4Ah. Ironically, AJ's voice actor is Canadian
8thats also why i dont like applebloom (u mad, sprinkles?)
8i like fluttershy
6Nope.avi
4Pinkie Pie WAS my least favorite at first
8holy fuck
8i just noticed something
6Fluttershy is awesome.
4What?
6Not in my top three, but still awesome.
4Yeah
6Yeah...
06dc?
8shes wearing glasses, and the "arms" of the glasses dont go over her ears
7yep
8they're attached to nothing
7...
7wut.
8HOW DO THEY STAY ON HER FACE?!
6Pinkie Pie. Just that random.
4Don't think about it
4Pinkie Pie can warp reality, and I've accepted that fact a long time ago
6Also, this world has crazy magic in it, and this worries you?
8INORITE?
8that bugged me the whole movie
8it was like they were glued on
6You mean they weren't glued on?
6I just assumed they were.
8true
8its because of the matrix

4Over in /pony/, under a "Superhero Pony" thread or something
8yup
8BILL MURRAY OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE
4I used to hate Bill Murray
8how could you ever hate bill murray?
7Also We watched a movie at school with Bill Murray in it, but he was there for like a second and that was it, but when he appeared I yelled "SUDDENDLY BILL MURRAY OUT OF NOWHERE" I got some weird looks to say the least
8awesome
7Dont remeber the movie though
8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130757539634.jpg
4And Murray was easily the very best damn character in that whole fucking film

11Howdy.
11So I got to look at a would-be competitor for streaming movies yesterday.
11Anyway, the show didn't even happen because we had to wait for someone. Not the streamer, mind you. Just...someone.
4Is that the stream that airs MSTs?
8lol
8ive seen 2 or 3 competitors popping up
11I think we're safe from any competition.
sucky
11For some reason, none of them get organized before trying to do said event.
11And in the end, only like five people would show up.
/me nuzzles
4Yeah, there's that. We're a pretty organized event and we usually get around 200 people every stream.
/me nuzzles

11makes sense.
8they have had all kinds of shit like this happen
11All that needs to be done is send a letter to FB admins.
11I didn't hear of that one.
4Silver's net is shitting out on him again lol

7Hopefully, this doesn't cause me to disconnect:
11Didn't we do that by accident?
In fact, why not do that? O_o
7INCOMING.
11A few weeks ago?
8whatever we can do to keep people out
I suppose, yeah.
11:D
Meh.
6dari, can you set up an auto-kick script for non-mods?
Yeah, but if they don't come in with their mod nick they're going to get kicked.
11That would be my problem.

6They can join another channel and change nick there.
I could set it up to recognise mod hostnames, but I haven't bothered to record all of yours.
That, and we plan on changing it after every movie to keep non-mods from discovering it.
Non-mods can discover it in 2 seconds. :P
....damn. I forgot about that.
This place is lively.
hmm?
...still, I like changing the name. :D
Wasn't talking about nicks, was talking about hostnames.
How come

4Haha
11Wazzup, peeps...

4DJ, col...nah
the show is tomorrow
6The code enforces it.
0wtf?
4True
6Though we can turn it on/off.
well that was random

Pretty much.

Hey.
We are a "B" stream. XD
4>_>
...
I'm not going to get into that.
well, competition's popping out
11WHere?
sadly I won't be able to stream MST3K
sadface
4Probably because this one's been succeeding
well, the stream we were announced with
because of the other stream
they specialize in MST3K
11What other stream?
11Ah.
4Man
4Bullshit
4*crosses arms*
11nah, let them go.
11MST3K isn't all that good for this kind of thing
11All the bashing is done for you.
and you could become the third streamer
is there going to be anithing here?
it's due tomorrow
read the post in EqD o:
we run on Fridays
4When does the MST stream run?
6 PM EST I recall
11On fridays?
understood
4So they run on Thursdays
Thursdays
4Alright
4Well that's cool
11Oh, then it's not much of competition if it's a different day.
4Exactly

Okay. :(
8whats a vac?
11...did you just call him chatroom?
4I did
let's try this again
4But shhh...no one's supposed to know :P
4Massive skipping, Astray : /

srsly?
4Yeah
11Yes.

4It's as bad as before man
4Alright
8still lagging pretty bad
4Lag
ok, now?
I see
the problem is with the encoding
y'know, i think another possibility could be
considering my computers are pretty old
4So...what do?
kill people
always cheers me up 8|
there's another possibility
I don't know how it works on Mac
8im starting to get real worried about next week
I think that, if we have to, we should just skip next week's BMN.
I'd rather have no stream than a stream that's lagging most of the way through.
4We'd have to go over it with the others
Astray
here's an idea
and zoom in?
/me pokes prince-
04erm
04If I make something an int and subtract it by more than it's assigend (let's say it's assigned to 5 and I subtract it by 6), does it just go to Zero?
8i agree that i would rather have no stream than a shitty one
4"Sorry, no stream next week, catch ya later?"
4Unless, we find someone to stream it for us...
4Like, ask Ponychan
8thats a bit of a crapshoot
still lagging like fuck am I correct?
13Yes

While waiting for her I decided to take some photos.. and a guard got all pissy and told me I couldn't take photos. I finished taking that shot and asked him why and he was like "You have to leave now"

14MEOW
4Yes, the one that got stickied
6Yeah, I just ignore a lot of the ponies that irritate me.
03I heard a meow
/me readies a cannon
Dude
you would hate Aero's sister
6IMHO, Soldier gives good advice, but outside of it he is quite pretentious. I honestly didn't even read any of the posts in that thread outside the first.
lol yeah that was the first thing i said :P
6And even in his advice he can be a flank.
oh dear.
14Lol you'd hate me
14Because cats literally grow off me
/me is made of catfloof and more of it
4For every huge post like that
4Which is about 99% of his posts
6Yep.
6Annoys me quite a bit.
6If you're going to stick with a personality, at least change the damn picture.
The best part is he throws away the can too and then casually walks on
4I do agree
4*sigh* I think I'm just gonna have to swallow my tongue on this one
4I can't fight Soldier now, he's too loved by the community
x3
Aero's little sister says meow a lot

4Here's how I see it

4and then, suddenly

Okay
this quest in particular involves Molag Mar, and a Arena being built
BUT the man building it is using slaves as gladiators against younger Redoran members
04...The decisions of?
Allow the Arena to be built
or Suspend it
04Well
6Have enough to last me a good while longer too.
04Give me the arguments
04Why should the arena be built in the first place?
to know how to fight, how to survive in harsh conditions
He is saying that people crave people
and the Great House of Redoran creates fighters for this peace
04There is a thing called sparring
He, basically, wants to train the youth of Redoran in a warrior-type fashion
04WHY DOES NO ONE REALISE THAT
04Anyway
04What would you rather do?
04Are you affilated with House Redoran?
I'm its fucking ArchMaster
aka like the Tevlanni Archmagister
04kthen
04Screw the slaves then
04BUILD IT

Pros; the youth of redoran get more training in combat and they get "entertainment" in Roman style
4Yes it is
or visit Telvanni lands on the mainland
04oh
04so there's more behind it than "Trainging Redoran:
04Yeahs.
04Go with the suspend option.
6Honestly, I'd get sleep, if it wasn't for the fact that I know I wouldn't get up until like, 2 PM.
Well it is an Arena
4Well, yes, there is that I suppose.
4If I didn't have family visiting, I wouldn't be worried at all about sleep
Which I still see as totally unfair on both sides
oh
yeah
or you can bet on the Blue Team
or the Yellow team
most of the people whom you see in the stands are assholes
04o-o
6Must... move... higher... on... GETters... list... *twitch*
don't really care if the gladiators die, unless their on the team they're betting on
Yeah
I go with septims
But yeah, it's akward in Morrowind for there's a slave market in Molag Mar
sorta like in Sadrith Mora
except you can't buy em
4GET threads are alright, I suppose
04I bought a slave once.
4I don't have anything against them
04So I set him free
4I've never even witnessed one : /
04I'm a good samaritan like that
but yeah
they are
they offer no benefits besides..
or in this case the "Adoring Fan"
04XD
04It was hilarious
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypXMAIL0p5w Here's accuracy
that even makes Dagoth Ur and Vivec Cringe

have you ever noticed Fargoth
are both the most annoying characters in Elder Scrolls history?

for uni
I had careers day today
04You already decided?
went to 3 IT lectures
04You've got two years
they were fucking awesome
or at least the first two
but I need an ATAR of motherfucking 91
to get in
I also like how 75% is considered "average"
because that's fairly easy to do
you had 187
04o-o
uh
138
04Anyway
12ATAR?
91 is a pretty damn high score
04wat
she was an ex-student of my school
04Is that even possible?
and apparently during that year
1/3 people got an ATAR of 99 or higher
04...
04shit
;_;
04I suddenly feel really pathetic.
Yeah
and yeah, 99.9 is possible
the highest is 99.95
but basically
if I want to get into the UNSW for an IT course
I need an ATAR of at least 91
and 97.85 for psychology
