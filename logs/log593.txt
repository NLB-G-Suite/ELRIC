OK......THIS IS IT......THE VERY LAST CHAPTER IN THE STAR WARS PREQUELS................I'M READY.............BRING IT OOOOOOOOOOOOOON
Movie start!
:D
To be honest the only Final fantasy game I ever played was 12
Well It's time to watch the last Star Wars.
Wait. So are we having two BMN per weeek now?
OMG
JESmith71: oh its been year since i played KH 1 and 2
Dark92Enigma, actually ep 6 is the last
Is Comcast gonna cooperate tonight?
IT BEGINS
o-o
I tried FF8 but never really enjoyed it much
Dat signature
13ssh
Beautiful.
what movie???!??!!?!?
13don't let them know we're on to them
Pinkies4thWall: It's summer. Trilogy event is in effect.
episode 3
0,14dats a nice signature
fox XD
Star Wars III.
the best rpg I've ever played is fallout 1, that kinda makes all jrpgs unenjoyable for me personally-
PinkiePieYoshi64: This is just a summer trilogy event
i've played all final fantasies 10 and onward, minus 10-2
dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
can you boost the sound Shizuka?
Episode 3 here we-*ded*
naskfnljkdlkjsflskflknvleknvlknwE
13just say your mantra three times and lie back and think of england
YEAH!
/me A long time ago......way after two TV series of nothing but FILLER
A long time ago.....
OH
"""STAR WARS"""
0,14so think of the Olympics, got it
Shizuka is best Shizu
ep 3 is best prequel
ok drinking game , eachtime you see filler , take a drink
Ddadadadadda.
STAR WARS >:3
Kefka is insane btw
YAY ITS TIME FOR THE WORST MOVIE EVAR
could be boosted a tad more
Olympics, horse cross country!
*sings star wars theme*
so fun
Ryunosuke: That's why i said PREQUELS
Crazy ass clown...
War, war never changes.....
WAR!
dun dun dun dun dun duuuunn\
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: Funny, this doesn't look like Dark Knight Rises.
SpadeMagnes[R] Kefka is best villian
Dooku!
war!
Dat WAR!
Octavia would be nice with this opener
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: are you kidding me
Fallout! Oh God
Star Wars, nothing but Star Wars, dun dun dun
This movie needs more Ron Perlman
13Ryunosuke: the problem with turning leveling on is the movie has enough quiet parts to throw it off
WAR!
I have played 1, 2, 4 - 12
General Grievous is in this!
twilight_sprinkle: kinda
This means WAR!
WHY CANT WE WATCH STAR PONIES?!?!?!
"There are heroes on both sides." No, there's not.
what about a maximizer and limiter?
cachi01: you know rikku in FFX?
No heroes on each side.
Now for the worst of the Star Wars prequels according to snobs.
la la la laaaaa
3 hours later
I thought the second movie was the worst.
13volume is as high as it goes here without turning on auto leveling
Nooooooooo!
Yeah the lame version of Grievous
Attack of the clones.
Send in everyone
FFx/x-2 wasnt a bad game, just was a bad FF game imo
that sun flare
Ryunosuke: technically the 6th one was the last but this <---- was the final prequel
He was so much cooler in the 2D Clone Wars
Tovler: Honestly this is the best of the three, which is....somewhat hilarious and also sad.
this movie is as good as the originals imo
Inbound awesome chase music, followed by 2 hours of boringness
/me 11,01levels Shizuka
If you watch the cartoon Grievous was badass.
/me 13has to resist just quoting the whole riff...
PREVIOUSLY ON STAR WARS: CLONE WARS
LOL
Nothing happened.
13not to mention i'm ahead of you guys anyway so it wouldn't line up
zomg
0,14dem alternate Jedi Starfighters
Send in everyone
ALL the sound effects
laggggggggggg
Barrel Roll.
so these were the prequels, not hte original 70s ones?
SaxyPretender: Jedi Interceptors
which side is which?
damn pop up adds
Vivix: yes
This fight doesn't seem terribly organized.
People like the original.
0,14ah there we go, forgot the name >.<
I liked the 3D cartoon version of Grievous the best. 2D seemed OP and overly stylish.
Everyone's just mixed together.
It's just flying.
EXPLOSIONS
with style.
BBOOM CRASH
R2!
GO R2!
R2 IS BOSSLY
Hello Different actor for Anakin.
I always like to remind myself that thi technology is inferior to ep 4-6 XD
continuity: anakin Still cant act
but I can't afford adobe premier, and I don't know shit abou video so don't know the alternative
This is easily the best one of the prequels. But it is just a dog turd without the scent, not as bad but still shit
Oh.
0,14you can tell by the broody eyes
13SaxyPretender: unfortunately
Dem early X-Wings
And the rock solid face.
CGI clones
Where are the Kerbals?
At least it's better than the Second Movie mind you.
We're in space
0,14fun fact: I have 2 toys for those Clone Pilots
"X-foils"
SPACE!
THERES TOO MUCH SHIT ON SCREEN
ded.
i have no opinion, i have never seen star wars :)
weeee
Shizuka we can tell you're way ahead of us <3
0,14ARC-170s <3

their job is to die
How can missiles fly in space?
13PFFFFFF
Heat seekers!
lol
God damn it Starfox could do a better job than you!
Is the Video quality bad because of the stream or the source?
PEW PEW
twilight_sprinkle: why did anakin want to help out an expendable unit? its too late to make up for the last movie...
13oh yes
13and pew pew
RosePetal1: same way rockets fly?
they flyin' fancy
This is the prequel I have the least problems with, but mainly because it actually feels like it's directly conencted to original Star Wars.
This makes me think of Sector Y for some reason
Bronysith: because hes a goody guy"
Starfox?
boooom
Shizuka: but of ccourse Pew pew
0,14I actually like the battles in the prequel trilogy
13they're right over the planet, so for once in the entire history of space movies it makes sense for there to be explosions
SpadeMagnes[R] or sector X with all the ships
twilight_sprinkle: but they are an expendable unit. No personality or anything
11,01Bronysith: PC repaired!
13audible explosions i mean
0,14Battle of Geonosis <3
I have very little problems with this one. Atttack of the Clones is the one I hate.
This movie seems so much more quiet without Rifftrax
I dislike most battlescenes, just not interesting
Nittany_Discord: ...
These things remind me of those things in halo
13woo woo woooooooooo~
but--yeah
noooo r-4
Now there's bugs.
so much for that
Ded
Nittany_Discord: GAAAAAAAAAAMMMMEEEEE TIMMMME
RIP R4
they sound really cute <3
What a stupid way to deploy droids.
11,01RIP R4.
R4 NOOOOOOOOOOO!
lol
Arfour ded
the droids i mean
Bronysith: ....good.guy. they always try to save everyone
13needs more of that car that goes OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Nittany_Discord: ded. movie over
Do a Barrel Roll!
twilight_sprinkle: thats like trying to save a particular piece of grass in a giant field
Bronysith: grass isnt sentient
Too bad.
Where is Starfox when you need them?
twilight_sprinkle: everything is burning but he wants to save ONE piece of grass
Bronysith: it doesnt feel pain or fear
simile
ooooo car is best car Shizuka
13and then anakin got obi wan killed, and the resulting paradox resulted in the entire star wars series ceasing to exist
The buzz droids are making Mrs. Doubtfire noises.
Probably for the best really.
Oh Anakin, always not listening I see.
oh Doubtfire!
Man that movie was fun
R2 FTW!
Go get him R2!
11,01Pinkies4thWall: Not ye.
R2-D2 FTW!
0,14Don't tase me, droid!
Yeah!
dat inertia
lol SaxyPretender
13r2 is having a party over there... WOOOOOOOOOOOOW!
over used
Astromech droids need better weapons for Buzzdroids
/me INB4 OBI-WAN INFAMOUS QUOTE
He said it!
USE THE BOOST
Dat infamous quote in every star wars movie.
wub wub]
R2 gives zero fucks
They keep using Bad feeling about this wrong.
vÃ¥b
laws of phycis there is no inerstia
13why did a droid groan...
I hate how the droids voices in this one changed
Shizu: Because reasons
how come obi gets a cool entrance and anakin just gets out normally?
0,14They dropped droids like sabers drop basses
Why do the droids need to talk?
Shizuka: its a joke
Shizuka: easter eg by the programmers
I remember there was a deleted scene where there was another Jedi on the ship but she was killed. Shak Ti was it?
Nittany_Discord: get on steam mate
13meryl streep ladies and gentlemen
GRIEVOUS!
Does R2 really need a cell phone?
cgi
lol
Grievous is very ill.
lol
Why does Grievous constantly cough?
Dat cgi
more dolls, less software
please
11,01Bronysith: Coming.
Hey look, it's Grievous after he's been grossly handicapped and has smoker's lung
What is grievous's race?
All the noobs are going, Who the heck is he?
Because Mace Windu destroyed part of his lung.
Droidekas
0,14his coughing was explaned in the Clone Wars cartoon iirc
SpadeMagnes[R]: probably not very well made
nope
Droid cars
SaxyPretender: yup
it looks like he has 6 fingers per hand Oo
Poor mooks
Droidekas, Y U SO WEAK
SaxyPretender: and why does he coughs?
Elevator needs moar music...
Lil_B: youll find out soon enough why
"Stop button"

cachi01, Windu crushed him IIRC
Damn it
13woop woop woopwoopwoop (\/);,,,;(\/)
ouch
Nittany_Discord: you have steam? add me? :3
Bad timing
dat nuthin
Droids are stupid
^
Just how much of Grievous is still organic anyway?
0,14and then Shizuka was Shizuberg?
Except for R2.
up R2?
And C3PO most of the time.
I hate how on this movie they made the droids stupid..
Back!
Zoidberg was based on three stooges, right?
UP, UP, AND AWAY
I don't like human talking robots
PinkiePieYoshi64: theyre robots
I thought that the emeny droids were always dumb.
kill them!
Vivix, more on Charlie Chaplin
uh oh
Don't Hurt R2.
Really? coo
11,01Press R2/
While since I watched anything by chaplin-
xD
LOL.
Ew
lolwut
why would they not shoot to kill , thy are in a battle as it is , yet they wanna take prisoners ?
13remember kids, r2d2 can FLY
It's oil.
press R2 to call R2
Go R2!
And Harold Loydd. Naturally
That was... uncalled for xD
Droids replaces jarjar in this one
so if the droid never said "hands up" the Jedi would be dead.
BURN BITCHES BURN
DAT JETPACK
Dat R2.
R2-D2 like a bawss
0,14I'm not cleaning that up
TROLL D2 FTW
Those things have shit armour.
lol
I'M MELTING------BY THE WORLD BUY THE WORLD
BY*
It's A TRAP!
I might have to take Nittany_Discord off my Steam Friendslist soon. Respecting Tov's ignore is going to make things VERY complicated, especially when a mod on my friendslist starts streaming Steam games.
These movies have such a wildly inconsistent tone.
forehadowing XD
Shizuka than whya didhe bother to work himself up the stairs at one point in ep 1?
its a crap!
Dooku!
11,01Kandarihu: What's up?
Its a trap
Insert boss fight music here
this dosn't looks suspicious at all.....
13oh crap it's saruman
CGI Man!
Dat stunt jump.
*guile theme*
i might have to get steam and add Nittany_Discord so can play tf2 :P
Specialty right right. YOU GOT OWNED BY HIM LAST TIME!!!
HEEEEEEEEE'RES DOOKU
TRY A SUMMERSAULT!!!
DO BARREL ROLL!!!
Oh God I hate this goddamn movie
Someone has me on ignore and I have to respect his decision.
Shizu: They cannot hope to contend with the will of Saruman.
Time to fight!
ITS THE WIZARD DOOOD
oh hi saruman
it's so damn pretentious
Nittany_Discord: are you ok with that?
Needs more music
HE IS ON FUCKING THRONE GODDAMIT
since when did opiwan go blue?
SpadeMagnes[R]: nah
13and once again neither of the jedi are going for any swings to do damage
Again, where's the music!
cachi01: we know
But I'm really even on Steam
He's not just Saruman, he's DRACULA!
Ooh, lightsaber choreography.
WHERE IS THE BOSS MUSIC DAMN IT
11,01twilight_sprinkle: I'm fine with that.
SpadeMagnes[R]: with no music there is more tension
he got really pissed during lotr filming when Peter tried to tell him how to sound like he was dying
otakon: but those stupid jedis dont
Shizuka: he's still awesome
THE PRICE HAS BEEN DOUBLED
He always had a blue lightsaber.
0,14WWII British Commando, heavy metal lister, descedent of Charlemagne
"I WAS IN THE WAR!"
13and is releasing his SECOND heavy metal album this year
Shizuka: when do you think he is going to bite it? never?
He's 90? Seriously?
o.o
Oh there it is
Music comes on.
SaxyPretender: could he be anymore badass
THE POWER HAS BEEN DOUBLED
Damn, he looks good for it
?
Nudge
owned
Shizuka He's into Heavy Metal?
0,14also, remember Grand Moff Tarkin of the Episode 4?
Dat CGI
13Dark92Enigma: he PLAYS heavy metal
I really don't want to unfriend Nittany_Discord. I'd like to do more Portal 2 with you.
Nittany_Discord: add me too? :P
I need to play TF2
I remember this afternoon we watched Robot Chicken Star Wars.
Notice how Yoda says neither light nor dark side is stronger , yet every Sith can always take on multiple Jedi with ease ?
heavy metal is pretty old though
It's a full moon
Fear leads to Anger, Anger leads to Prequels <------------
His ARM!
so I'm not surprised old people like it
OWNED
dead
Lets hand it to him
11,01Steam is loading super-slow for me.
GOOD ANNIE GOOOD
dat smile
Don't do it!
13kill him a lot...
cmon he's deffensless
Count Doku needs a hand
Give him a hand everypony
Kill him twice.
OOH OOH GW2 stress test tomorrow
owned
Shizuka the jedi sword style is a defence one, excepted anakins wich is a heavy strike version of the jedi form
you chicken, mcfly?
13JUST DO IT YOU WIMP

What's the sound of one hand clapping?
Dont do it
headshot +200 XP
do eet.
DED
11,01I hate your music *decapitates*
ded
lol
NOOOO CHRitopher LEEE!
Shizuka: :D
he pretty much had to do it.
dooku's all SON OF A BITCH! YOU SAID I'D GET COOKIES
TrixieMuffin: both sides are euqal. but the jedi are stringer in numbers. In the films 2 sith have to made up for all the jedi to be equal
I wouldve killed him AND the chancellor
How will this movie get entertaing.
dangerous.... with no hands....
wat
And then anakin and obi wan and yoda and that guy over there
heh on armed.. no hands...
Meanwhile a battle is still going on
13oh hey
13i never noticed that
about YOUR MOTHER
SpadeMagnes[R]: Really.
A hand for a hand
Yes, and that was also wrong.
dem sand people in the back
13the reaction shot of anakin after he mentions the sand people, you hear an echo of them
Not the Jedi way. But Obi Wan had to kill Darth Maul.
WHY U DESPERATE TO ABANDON OBI WAN?!
I noticed that too.
lol
Shizuka How come i never knew that?
God i hate palpatine -_-
Shells?
DEFINITELY NOT SUSPICIOUS
So how much of Grevious is organic anyway?
oh god terrible VA
WILHELM
yay
THAT SCREAM
wilhelm scream
13PREPAH TO BROADSIDE!
xd
I heard Wilhelm Scream.
RosePetal1, Darth Maul wasn't defenseless.
oh hai robot that's been **cked up
AHH
Whilhiem!
wilhelm FTW
the cancellor kinda looks like the older version of Q (and I don't mean like John Delance now)
Oh.
Shizuka: you never noticed that? i heard it the first time i saw this shit in *megusta face* 6th grade
I also heard Wilhelm
Bronysith: its not stupid...
Shizu: Pirates ref?
13want it to be next week
aaaAAAAh.
Oh no!
Uh.
13so i can show pirates :3
The Egg Carrier is Loosing altitude!
see and this makes no sense. spaceships, but the board-weapons look like teched up pirate cannons
twilight_sprinkle: it is inconsistent
Lil_B, I do admit there is some similarity
GRAVITY BITCH
Bronysith: lucky you. i never have
0,14the best thing to come out of the prequel series was the Clone Wars game
arent they in space?
*Insert Metroid Escape sequence here*
But wait Pirates was not a trilogy.
^
What pirates are on next week?
Um, would artificial gravity really work that way>?
I woke up to find that someone put my ac to 90 degrees =.=
twilight_sprinkle: would you agree that the prequels are somewhat inconsistent?
And Star Wars BattleFront.
Hi everypony.
hi ZappyTheUnicorn!!!
SaxyPretender and Battlefront
0,14and Star Wars Battlefront
SpadeMagnes[R]: I think it was brain, heart, lungs, trachial throat, and half of his stomach.
Hi ZappyTheUnicorn
hi ZappyTheUnicorn
Is the Oceans Trilogy next week.
Whee!
0,14how did I forget that ;__;
DocSane I think at this point its the gravity of the planet
Bronysith: all jedi get the urge to get revenge, theyre human. whats important is that they dont dwell on it
twilight_sprinkle: ep 1 darth maul had high ground and obi wan killed him. Episode 3 "i have the high ground" he chops anakin
weeeeeeeee
Vivix, it couldn't be One Piece. Too many movies.
Battlefront is amazing
Saxy Ginx
dat hug
13i'll check our lists, i'll show oceans if we have an opening
Yeah- pirates of the carribean?
Were gonna die!
Bronysith: yeah, the high ground thing was stupid. but other than that 3rd episode is excellent
0,14Shizuka, FUND IT
Lil_B: Except they're still in free fall, and... Oh, never mind.
This escape needs more metroid music
dem bathooks
SaxyPretender: you must be tired, you were raveing about battlefornt just last week
Lack of music!
0,14I was?
Shizuka you got Back to the Future?
hat-hooks even
twilight_sprinkle: again. it is just a dried turd without the scent. not as bad as a wet steaming pile.
I like the background music
13we showed that already
Bronysith: in the episode 3 videogame theres an alternate ending where anakin kills obi wan the same way obi wan killed darth maul
xD
Shooeie, we already did BttF
Lol shields.
cachi01: i know. i played it
So what was Grevious before he became a cyborg anyway?
Why does he have a russian accent?
the cone of silence
General, if you're a droid, why are you coughing?
Goddamn that line
Obi Wan is talking about the writers
Dig under....
:( The Matrix, Pirates, Lotrâ¦ I hope we have room for the Oceans Trilogy
nope
13r2d2 is perpetually high...
Anakin is being Patient!?
THE MATRIX
YES
"How did this happen, we're smarter than this!"
WHY DO THE SHILEDS DO SOMETHING, AND THE RAILINGS DON'T?
Droidekas!
goddammit
xD
dat kick
13we did matrix too
13first week
Bronysith: fighting against your friends is fun :D
How dare you kick R2.
dammit
Goddammit this movie
SHIELDS*
twilight_sprinkle: ooh also. ep 2 obi wan jumped out the window when it wouldve made sense for anakin to do so. then obi wan said "Patience use the force. Think your way through"
R2 is.... incredibly owned...
Bronysith: also, obiwan was avenging someone else, whereas anakin was angry at dooku for losing his arm. metaphore or not, youre wrong
ARGH!
0,14not sure if Lampshade...
Wait, Shizuka. We did?
If you kick a Droideka, it rolls
Icecream makes everything better :)
Lord of the rings?
^
^^
^^^
Dear God...
Anakin Skywalker.
did we do Jaws yet ?
Lotr was good, and Mike Morasky worked on it
lol.
suddenly the droids have attitudes?
so it's win win
twilight_sprinkle: obi wan impulsed and then said use patience lol
DocSane: dat combo breaker
Why does he keep collecting the lightsabers?
haha
otakon: he's not a droid
SpadeMagnes[R]: trophies of battle
13SpadeMagnes[R]: next week on Hoarders
0,14"shorter than expected"
Apparently George was jealous of the guy that created grievous
He's part droid.
0,14CALLBACK
Nice come back
SpadeMagnes[R]: Its his thing
/me grabs otakon s beard
SaxyPretender: call forward
Shizuka we're still due for an Indiana Jones trilogy
we're running out of Trilogies with more than 1 good movie in them.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: no the goddamn droid that said "You're welcome"
So, he's a Jedi bounty hunter.
13next week
Oh, the Matrix sequels were the only movies of the trilogy I skipped out on.
Dat diversion....
0,14...touche
Bronysith: im tired of expaining obvious things just because you want to hate the prequels so much
R2 is on crack
Bronysith: ouch, what are you doing?
I want that sword.
oh YEAH
Well, I can't stay for long. See ya'll later.
/me licks otakon s beard
Is it really wise to be fighting in the control room?
O_o
Bronysith: he jumped because had he waited a second more the droid wouldve flown away
No.
How do I take any of this seriosuly iof the droids are ALL played for comedy?
Where's the music.
yeah it can fight with no head
11,01Suddenly my grandmother's internet has gone to hell.
RosePetal1: nope. he justs kills jedi and collects their swords.but for his own reasons
I can't believe we had the Matrix trilogy already...how did I miss it?
That's amazing.
twilight_sprinkle: but it was out of character. considering that anakin is the impulsive one
movies are better the less muisc they use
RosePetal1: the klaxon is the mucis
Bronysith: when he told anakin to wait the villain was trapped in the bar place, there was no escape for him
Coward.
the headless hores
DocSane: trick question. you eat the droids for dessert
Boss fight
We stopped considering droids a threat movies ago.
twilight_sprinkle: i like skyrim i am not going to like the prequels...
hello ther
Bronysith: it wasnt out of character, being wise doesnt mean being slow
Nope.
YOU LOSE GOODD AY SIR
13GENERAL! WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT THROWING LIGHTSABERS IN THE HOUSE!
smart actually
the godfather is a trilogy
YOU GET NOTHING
oh god I love legs like that
GAME OVER, MAN, GAME OVER
*horse
Wouldn't they suffocate as well...
Aliens a trilogy.
sort of
Actually WHY does a droid run ship have oxygen in it?
Needs more metroid escape music!
Physics don't matter.
0,14I really like his cape
their bodys should decompress now :/
Bronysith: yeah and how hard was it to get you to even try to play skyrim
RosePetal1: it was shown already
0,14also, not just droids in there, otakon
Can Step Up still be considered a trilogy?
hi
PinkiePieYoshi64: Greivous has a independant supply
Batman Nolan series is a triology.
I really like her.... mane?
Lil_B: questioning stuff? do it right! Bodies*
Grevious still has lungs
ABANDON SHIP!..........CRITICS AND CRITICS FIRST!!!!!
and other organs
he's gonna crash it
Talking about physics in a Sci Fi movie is boring
Indiana Jones was a trilogy. Well kinda.
UH OH
THE EGG CARRIER NUUUU
dat UH OH
Dat uh oh....
RosePetal1: It will be shown NEX WEEK
Indiana jones
ud oh
NEXT*
welp, there goes the reverse thrust
Bronysith: like i said, that wasnt out of character. whats more our ot character, however, is that obiwan said they shouldnt do any more than protect padme, now That was inconsistent
Ooo I've never seen indiana jones, you guys gonna show it?
Half a ship is better than no ship.
Excellent! I finally have internet connection. Looks like I missed the first movie though
Is Speed a Trilogy?
Now THIS is podracin!

*g!
BronyInstrumental I question everything! and no bad gremer will stop me
Robotnik is gonna be pissed....
Grrr as I was sleeping I overheard my mother say that they were going to my father's house to eat. I wae up and bam no one except me
It's a meteor!
wut ?
-wake
dod we do Lord of the Rings yet?
*did
SpadeMagnes[R]: No PROMOTION for them
I think we did.
Bronysith: and yet despite saying that he jumped after the droid. that was inconsistent, but its not a reason to condemn the episode
Dat police escort :O
Easy R2, you almost made me act!
Send in everyone!
Lol hoses.
from their facebook: "We will be conducting a stress test on Thursday, August 2 from 12:00 Noon PACIFIC Time to 4:00 PM PACIFIC Time."
too hot
It's too hot!
Bronysith: plus i was talking about ep 3, ep 3 is excellent
MAVERIIIICK!
twilight_sprinkle: "Oh anakin i cant love you. i just cant" she says whilst wearing a very sexy outfit
WOAAAAH
Hot like sand.
this is why anakin is best starpilot
Land gears
Did we do Twilight yet .... (ducks and runs)
Half life is not a trilogy
/me licks TrixieMuffin
I saw all Twilight movies
No.
noot bad
like a boss!!!
Avatar was worse
/me NOTHING LIKE A GOOD LANDING..........
TrixieMuffin: YOU CANT RUN AWAY FROM ME!!! *GETS AN AXE*
we all know why...
What about the people in that tower?!
Twilight is not a trilogy.
ehh still have to re download everything ...
Vivix: I'm very sorry
Any landing you can walk away from.
Twilight Sparkle is
Did we do all the G3 pony videos yet?
lol
It wasn't worse than anyo ther teen movie
Bronysith: hormones maybe, but again, those are minor details
TrixieMuffin: That's noa trilogy, that's a pony.:)
Avatar seriously pissed me off more
/me murders DocSane
The falcon can be spoted int that secen btw
No, let's hope not.
11,01Testing.
And yet... what happened to the battle above Coruscant... it LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL DAY!!!
why do vampires in twilight sparkle?
11,01Chat is not moving for me.
Wasn't Harry Potter 8 rejected because it was gonna get played in the future?
In the Lego Game Obi-wan and Anakin never got kidnapped in the first place
its working...
Bronysith: youre not honestly saying ep2 sucked because padme wore a saucy dress?
So do these Star Wars prequels count as animated films?
oh wait , is Underworld a trilogy ?
twilight_sprinkle: it just seemed like one of the most forced romances ever. idk, they arent the worst movies i have ever seen
SaxyPretender: that was horrible by my standards. that landing?
cratorkid: the sick and weird mind of stephanie meyer
Did we do Sipderman yet?
PinkiePieYoshi64: battle probably happend of the other side
0,14yeah >.<
OH SURE
I love how he just blows off him killing Doku
Bronysith: yeah, it's not great. but the hate is just because hate is fun
Fou_Lou: Hmm... seems plausable...
nine times.
Crap, I see Jar Jar.
twilight_sprinkle: no. i mean it was a sexy natalie portman. i know i would like to dock in her port....man
Mace Windu.
:P
Moar shit we don't get to see. Yaaaaaaay.
im still trying to think of trilogies
RosePetal1: Let's hope he doesn't TALK
Bronysith: yeah, ep 1 and 2 isnt too good. but its not bad either, and its enjoyable. and as for ep 3, imop its as good as originals
We do the Spiderman Trilogy yet?
0,14oh hey it's Samuel L. Jackson IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
He doesn't
damnit Jar Jar, why are you still alive???!!!
lotr
The Dark Knight Trilogy
that gold armor
that blue guy from the last movie really let himself go XD
I already said lotr
twice
So Much Bluescreen
i know jedi are space monks and all, but they should start considering blasters
Lol that reminds me of that Robot Chicken skecth from earlier this afternoon.
twilight_sprinkle: i think that episode 1 couldve been tossed. ep 2 is awful. i think the only prequel that should exist is 3. then shit makes sense
twilight_sprinkle: i tend to agree. For my taste in Ep 1 and 2 it seemed like nothing really was happening
mua
those hair buns
...:S
I seen those somewhere
oh... wait
Leia buns
I should put on headphones so I can hear the movieâ¦ nah
Bronysith: what i love about the prequels is that for once love isnt the ultimate goodness,they show how love can be just as evil as hate. they also show the dangers of emotion at all, which is quite innovative relative to most other movies
RIP OFF!
Dem buns
13(this is one of those quieter bits of the movie i was talking about that throws off autoleveling)
Well, at least we know where Leia got that hairstyle from.
Dat whisper
13it's so much quieter than action scenes it overcompensates
Mmm cinnabon- Wait
Bronysith: also the prequels have much more character development than ot
They could have compacted the first three episodes into one movie.
/me not sure if better love story than twilight :|
They should have mastered the movie soundtrack better
Bronysith, then Anikin's mother would be a noodle incident.
Mom? MOM?!?!
twilight_sprinkle: too bad it's brought to us via souless sword fights and bad acting.
DAMMMMMIIIITTTT ADD
RIP OFF <-------------- Like Mother, like Daughter
Bronysith: he couldve been better
PREGGERZ
she's PREGGERS
oh sheet
twilight_sprinkle: but he isnt god awful.
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUN
DUN DUN DUN!
WOOOOP
:S
His face...
YOURR WHAAA?!?! *Slashes her witha lightsaber*
twilight_sprinkle: he is a whiny character. CAUSE IT WAS IN THE SCRIPT
OMG BABBIES
Looks like she has buns in the oven... as well as her hair.
goddamn herdmind
DUN DUN DUUUN!
Too much heterosexuality
So...completely random question for anyone who's still on here. If Pinkie's sister, Inky, were to have a daughter, what would said daughter's name be?
dat face
13so.. nine months pass between here and the end of the movie?
Awkward....
Bronysith: hes pretty bad id say, his acting just doesnt fit right
13or..
:O
I is pregant.
HOW IS BABBY FORMED?
I guess.
I bet nobody could have predicted that would happen
Shizuka: I would guess 9 months
6_9
Shizuka: MAGIC JEDI FORCE PREGNANCY
:O Shocker
stuff is sbout to go down
Let us embrace.
Shizuka: 6 to nine probably
I have no idea
hello!
Bronysith: i dont hate him, but his acting is just weird at times
twilight_sprinkle: it is the writing, he did fine with the shit lines given to him
Shizuka: premature birth more likely
13and yeah that music spike, can't do leveling tonight :/
she also ate spaghetti\
Utapau :D
Haha
Blame the script writer.
Shoot. I suck at making up names.
I still find the explination for the Force in the prequels bullshit
The planet that is one huge pit!
Writers have to take their part of the blame when actors fuck up
be back getting popcorn
What's the character?
Bronysith: like i said, it doesnt fit imo at times
twilight_sprinkle: one thing that really bugs me though is the midochlorians
did someone just said something about spaghettie? now im hungry lol -_-
Padme is pregnant. Enter, Luke.
Shizu: According to my novels....3 years between Ep 2 and 3.
In the lego games the Effects were much better
UTApau
SpadeMagnes[R]: i like it more than "uhhh its a mystical power around us"
It's not just the directors fault, It can be the script writers fault anyone.
Bronysith: another thing i dont agree with, imo medichlorians are a very good idea
haha chicken legs
twilight_sprinkle: in the OT it was a spiritual thing...in the prequels they are biological...
Bronysith: True. It's really hard to take this dialog seriously regardless of how well it's spoken
dat cough
Hello emperor.
hiya Emp
Daughter of Pinkie's sister Inky, thus making her Pinkie's niece. She's not all that important in the grand scheme of things, just needs a name.
dat bow
dat Darth Sidious
So yeah, well over 9 months. This is near the end of the Clone Wars, and Ep 2 was the start of that war.
It's weird that the third movie got the most praise just because of Dar-...well, you'll find out.
Grievous's coughing has evolved into wheezing.
BUT WE LOST COUNT DRACULA!
SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE
Did luke write this?
Blot.
father ?
Dat emperor
I mean seriously, they couldn't FRIGGIN FIND HIM BEFORE THIS?
WAIT!
BUT WE LOST SARUMAN!
dat robe
Never mentioned because otherwise the story would get clogged.
Bronysith: saying ''magic'' wouldve been a cheap way out. the force is still spiritual, but since they exist in our universe, there has to be an explanation to how they manipulate it
Yeah the Sith don't work like that
Lol.
He likes them young
His name... shall be DARTH BACON!!!
blablablabla dark side blblablablabla anakin
Apprentice kills the MASTER
Anyone remember that guy from the 2D Clone Wars cartoon I mentioned yesterday?
Blot doesn't sound right. Too masculine.
13CriticKitten: i mean from here to the end
wait.....that sounded like palpatine
Explaning everything is a nerd thing, a lot of things are better left unexplained in stories
wooooooohooooooo
THEN he gets his own apprentice and it continues
I loves your hair.
dat hair
PALPATINE'S BEHIND IT ALL
13BronyInstrumental: naaaaaah couldn't be
boring part
twilight_sprinkle: but now it sounds like it is biotic powers like from mass effect
Where did he get that scar on his face?
Then there is a crazy scene.
Shizu: Naw, she's probably in her third tri right now.
BBBBOOOOOOOORRRRIINNNNGGG:O
Here, you guys build her a character. I'll only ever have to show bits and pieces of it, anyway.
brushie brushie brushie
twilight_sprinkle: like you have to be born with the ability to use it instead of just intense training
Clone wars.
In the Lego Games there WAS no boring parts
:)
ugh god the dialog hurts my soul -_-
BOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Bronysith: mass effect was after and i didnt play it. doesnt sound bad
The rest of the fandom has always been better at making up OCs.
:'( It's a TRAP!!!
fuck you
nope
filler- drink
:):)dawww
lol
That's because it's Lego. Legos are always funny.
Woman...
blah blah blah
Vivix: i agree. But i dont care. Especially if a world is build through the storys
Fun Fact: Thats a wig he's wearing
Bronysith: they never said everyone could be a jedi in the Ot either
is the force unleashed canon in the timeline?
Crazy Dreamn.
Dont Jedis get spayed and neutered?
Shizuka: i seriously can't tell if you're serious or not, never seen any SW movies
The thing is, the midichlorian explanation removes any semblance of plausible deniability to the Force.
try out Maas Effect it's awesome
and then there was plot
13previously on general hospital
Foreshadowing
oh lord
Shizu: Notice the massive baby bump they're trying to give her? She's probably supposed to be third trimester.
PREMONTION?
What was that?
>mfw mst3k guys mentioned Lego Star Wars in this.
Buffer!

cachi01: Supposedly it happend between Ep 3 and 4

Dat buffer inside him.

Want me to screenshot it? xDDDDD
I just saw this in my head. Pinkie sees Mace Windu. Says, "HEY EVERYPONY! THIS JEDI IS REALLY, REALLY BALD!"
Man Anikin works out
OGOD
nevermind lol
What the?
I think shizuka is just looking at his nipples
Ha
damn wtf
Oh yeah that's a better buffer image.
WTF
Guys, let's just say one thing, at least there's no more Jar Jar Blinks after this.
DAMN
Buffer cannot handle it.

PinkiePieYoshi64: i just did
DEJA VU
ADKNKFNIEfn;pin:FN

Arent Jedis spayed and neutered?
Sits up in bed
Be honest did anyone care for Jar Jar
AT NIGHT
I didnt
jesus this is like soap opera acting
he just got laid >:3
SpadeMagnes[R]: no
though--might stil lbe good
Meanwhile: didja get that one or no?
SpadeMagnes[R]: not a goddamn soul
Actually Jar Jar shows up briefly in the ending
Then he starts dremaing again.
Spectrum_Rush: I got it
augmented arm
Doesn't say nothing though
I missed Jar Jar while watching episode 2.
I cared for Jar Jar... until he messed up in Ep. 2...
*deus ex*
at least he's wearing pants
good man otakon
VenHur96: but there will ewoks -.-
Good thing.
Spectrum_Rush: ofc :)
SpadeMagnes[R], not to my knowle... hey, Vordox liked him, right?
Beautfiul city.
be kinda awkward to buffer with him with his pants down
Spectrum_Rush: I've had enough of Star Wars buffers damnit.
heyo
JESmith71: but does he TALK? (i hope NOT)
/me suddently shivers over the Eworks cartoon
Being an ink blot.
otakon: make sure to share it ;)
ive had a wet dream again
I HAD A PREMONTION
oh god
Spectrum_Rush: I shall, hold on
Good thing we won't see Ewoks cartoons.
PinkiePieYoshi64: the ones who gave him political power messed up. a moron could see that hes easylie manipulated and just not up for the task
http://cheezburger.com/6472579584
PinkiePieYoshi64: I cared for Jar Jar until he opened his mouth, which was about .5 seconds after he was introduced
A dream, within a dream...
it was a dream.... hair flick*
rustymeat had a wet dream, no wonder he is rusty
twilight_sprinkle: INCEPTION?
o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o
I saw jar jar when I was like 12?
Dark92Enigma: BWOOOONG
I don't remember if I liked the movie
BRB
I don't think we watched it all
Star Wars I came out when I was 6 or 7.
the original?
More sappy kissing.
Less kissing more action.
.....so is that why he doesn't like his son?
kissing > action
kiiiiiiisssssssss NUUUUU
I remember watching this movie only because I wanted to see how this schlocky series would end.
but this is s..not great
FAIL
Guys. I need my daily olive fix

FORESHADOWING
Okay, random DC
oh dear
twilight_sprinkle: you cant argue with those whos vision is blurred by the classics
Did anything good get thought of during that time?
Bronysith: eh, even De Lancies voice doesnt amaze me that much
....wat
Fou_Lou: This^^^^^
TRAIN
sdsds
"Attachment leads to jealousy!" Bullshit.
ishggydggy
TRAIN... your dragon!
thanks PaladinDrakkenwolf Spectrum_Rush and Midnight_Fyre :)
In no way does that make sense.
:|
No not really.
shit , everything leads to the dark side , why not just cut the crap and all become sith ?
CriticKitten: it does if you want it to...
MOAR ACTION
YES
Minky(i think this is a fabric or something) Miriam Pie ?
I don't like actioon
didnt Revan say the same thing during the mandalorian wars?
:P
the best action movie I've seen is eh..Die hard
ACTION FTW
was not expecting to like it
action is good and bad
13in short, he has a bad feeling about this
TrixieMuffin, not everything.
I'm not your Buddy, Pal-patine
http://postimage.org/image/cc55kvfpb/ for those who were too slow
/me returns with olives, a fork, and a quart of water
good to watch, bad to movie
Vivix: it had pretty clever action
twilight_sprinkle: i think most of the hate against the prequesl orinigates on the love of the classics. But most forget no new film could be even with the classics
Minky is slang in England for something that isn't clean.
Lol.
twilight_sprinkle: No, it doesn't. :p Attachment leads to greed and coveting, NOT jealousy.
Yeah, Die Hard was way more fun than I thought it would be
"jedi are sitting and waiting while the outer rim burns"
We got to have MONEY.
I wonder what happened to action to take that away
oh noes
Minky sounds good
Minty?
Minty's taken
well i dunno don't know slangs
RosePetal1: MUNNEH
Wait
CriticKitten: someone always has more than you or something you want, if you get attached to material things that creates jealousy
Is that true Meanwhile?
GAH ADD
Yes.
13moar powerpoint transitions!
twilight_sprinkle: still better actor than kristen stewart...
You can hear how overwhelmed he is
CriticKitten: you also lose things while others dont
Well so much for that
Yes, your bland line delivery clearly shows how overwhelmed you are
Gasp.
twilight_sprinkle: at least he has facial expressions
twilight_sprinkle: But that's an indirect relationship, and it's based firmly in greed.
Fou_Lou: yeah and its become self-indcuing, hating the prequels is a trend at this point
There are spirits.
you can have attachment without greed
2BLEK
Mace Windu.
Kristen Stewart's ok for a method actor.
uh oh
13waaaaaa it's unfair!
aniken is a real dickhead
you should have just said, yes
SHUT UP.
SAI WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
o-O
and thank you
great acting
LIFE ISNT FAIR BITCH
I kinda enjoyed Twilight, but Kristen Stewart really has only one face
Ki-Adi-Mundi's head disturbs me
and that is SQUINT
CriticKitten: its indirect, but thats already dangerous for a jedi
TAKe A SEAT
It's not fair :'(
BOO FUCKING HOO. D:<
TAKE A SEAT but dont sit down
because you dont know everything skywalker
Bronysith: the kid in ep 1?
WAH WAH! Why can't I be in the council? Wah wah!
:|take a seat
listen to samule L
niqqa
Son I'm dissapoint
sit down
twilight_sprinkle: what no. i mean hayden
Worst part of character creation is naming, swear to God
It's worse with ponies too
Oh god this is hitting star trek levels of weird
0,14*ahem*
Agreed
Slient you.
twilight_sprinkle: kristen stewart has no facial expressions
Cry about it that will make a difference
Ze WOOKIES!!!!! :D
Shut and take yo' seat!

he has
THIS IS WHY I AM A SITH
Bronysith: whos kristen stewart
Was Kristen ok in Adventure Land?
At least Hayden tries to show emotions TRIES.
Yoda is going to Kashyyk to find a star map!
13baaaawwwwww
twilight_sprinkle: i most probably dont hate the prequels because i didnt grew up with the classics and doesnt have the loved view of the classics
Bella in Twilight
twilight_sprinkle: No, Yoda's just speaking in too many absolutes, is all. :P
twilight_sprinkle: the bitch from twilight i think
shaddap bitch
uh Ki-adi mundi was a knight on the council anakin so stop you bitching :|
Did you hear about the affair?>
13anakin never asked for this
Kashyyyk is spelled WEIRD.
twilight_sprinkle: And as we know, only a Sith deals in absolutes.
"How could this happen to me"~
o-o-o-o-o
CriticKitten: its a well-known monk philosophy to not be attached to material things
IN THE LEGO GAMES THEY JUST SKIPPED TO YODA'S ADVENTURE WITH CHEWIE
I was never prepared for this?
anikin is such a bitch
Any other brilliant ideas? I need brilliant ideas to make up for my own lack of brilliance.
a bitch anakin is
http://cheezburger.com/6476540672
indeed
CriticKitten: its not absolutes, its just a danger, they dont kick you out for having some attachments, its just warnings
and one caption later
Kristen cheated on Robert. I was so heartbroken
13i'm sorry guys, the stream seems to have switched to desperate housejedis again
Shizuka: lol
xD
hehe
and guess what guys?
xDD
Enough with the frigging boring space politics!
otakon: LOL
Are the original old ones the same?
Gueaa who'a back, back again, guess who's back, tell a friend
So much drama
Let's all agree Kid Anakin is better than that Anakin. <---
THAT ANAKIN IS A SPY!
IT STILL HAS ANOTHER hour and thirty left!
THE ANI IS A SPY
Fou_Lou: yeah, i feel about the same
he is a sith
I could be watching GCB instead of this.
Shizuka at least it's not Curescant Shores
Vader is best Anakin
lord
otakon: :(
Sure the chancilor laughs like a mad man but he cant be evil
You know, the jedis really f***ed up here
dat lame duck senator
No, he's evill. EVIL@

Oh so this GUY becomes Darth Vader?
EEEEEVVVIIILLLL!!!!
JUST DO IT
I can take the politics. I lasted all the way through Legend of Galactic Heroes. Now THAT's some serious space politics.
twilight_sprinkle: imagine super botoxed girl
DO IT FAGGOT
Vivix: Eeyup.
We are at war ....that justifys treason Anakin
otakon: :'(:'(:'(
Woo
Just do it!
Okay now I am a little interested
facepalm
twilight_sprinkle: absolutely no facial expressions. "i am so happy" no smile
that's what she said
Shizuka yes... and teenage-Problems
Ok now I'm convinced that fiery joker not being a Brony is an act
:)
A Republic Gunship in regular traffic... where's the crime! :O
How is Anakin the chosen one agin?
Teenage Angst problems.
twilight_sprinkle: the classics have their flaws too. I found the ewoks about the same annoing than jarjar and the trench flight scene isnt that plausible either
When the LEGO ADAPTATION IS MORE FUN FOR ADULTS THAN THE MOVIE YOU HAVE MADE A SHITTY MOVIE
Meanwhile: http://cheezburger.com/6457506304
Bronysith: like a droid :P
Except I had to rewind through more than half of the dialog.
Well, at least it's stil slightly better than Attack of the Clones
dangerous putting them together, like diet coke and mentos
Because ....
FINALLY
twilight_sprinkle: a droic has more emotion
droid
did they go to the department of mysteries or something?
Does the Drop ship have a name or something?
StinkomanFan: Or the legos are just really fun, just saying, those games are fun
Chewbacca.
0,14Republic Gunship is best ship
0,14I have a toy of one
Ironic fact: he ends up fulfilling the prophecy by killing Palpatine, thereby "destroying the Sith".
13this movie...
^
Just way too late to save anyone. :D
Speak as Yoda does, One does not simply.
Bronysith: a stoic has more emotion
lol
lol.
SaxyPretender: What about friendship?
Fou_Lou: yeah. i also enjoy the political arguments and the character development in the prequels, is wall as their portrayal of love being potentially evil, which is quite innovative for movies
I have 2 Titanium Gunships :P
This movie LOOKS kinda cheap-
lord
of
the
mitamaking, I was talking about the Lego sets

Used to have the Shark gunship from Clone Wars :(
YOU DON'T SAY!

I am just waiting for the action in the end
StinkomanFan: says the pony fan then
destroying the principles more than 100 colombine kids.
at this point I wouldn't mind a Action Scene out of nowjere without purpose and reason
Who wants lord of the rings instead?
Don't listen to him.
Don't ask me to act!

SaxyPretender: friendship is BEST ship
UGGHHH
best line in the movie: "not the younglings!"
I do what I want!
Do it
i never understood what he said there
13not a single luxury...
COME ON!
I'll take it :)
whoa
Say children not younglings.
"Hold me like one of your French girls."
0,14no, Republic Gunship is XD
plotting *trololol*
Who wrote this!?
I'm not sure I like this more than the other prequels now.
haha she said plot
twilight_sprinkle: good thing in the prequel is that they arent black and white. The calssics pretty much are (empire evil rebels good).
Ah, the city.
even John Williams is bored
No plots?
Tovler: Well Said :D
uh you've been "in love" throughout the entire war and not before
Ah well, so much for that
Bubbles!
Running Running talking and no action.
BUBBLES!
Blitzball!
o-o
Fou_Lou: yeah that too. some people complain and say "everyone is a villain", which isnt even true, but it doesntt even sound bad to me
Dat bubble
...Anyone is interested in a Star Wars MMO?
it gets good around the.... oh wait it doesn't
twilight_sprinkle: right here i think it was intended that sidious made anakin...
F****** bubbles!
there is a star wars mmo
They grew up on a rock farm

pls dont end the war :c
VenHur96, not after SWG
How about something crystalline.

no war means no action
MMO is bad because ..they have npc's instead of 100% player run
just makes it uninteresting
...Saxy, you're a genius.
Seriously, this dialog is starting to hurt my brain
Bronysith: made him turn you mean?
Leave!
That's a kid from the Flinstones.
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
0,14I have my moments
no action means more shitty lovey dovey scenes
music derail
0,14rare, but they exist
What do these bubbles do?
"and don't claim refunds for your tickets later"
anyone remember on the cartoon network show, the clone wars, grievous' ship, the malevolence?
Just like that? those guys didn't ask questions? :O
You dingleberry.
sooo... how is that an opera
twilight_sprinkle: no that he used the midochlorians to create life
Wow, they must've paid good creds for that bubble performance.
shizuka yes.
name her geoodude ?
Yes.
Octorock!
Needs more Crow
Palpatine thinks he is boss... god...i HATE HIM
Its sperm btw
obivous movie villian
Maybe it's The Phantom of The Bubbles.
Bronysith: naaaah
And now for Pebbles' four kids. One's named Pinkie, after her great-aunt, but I still have to name the other four...
had HUGE ASS ion cannons on the sides?
Kandarihu, they spend half the CGI budget on that concert :p
13dat hyperbole
twilight_sprinkle: there was no father...
0,14Rocky =P
twilight_sprinkle: i like it. Because everyone has pretty much their own goals. and they trick and manipulate each other. thats pretty cool. And the development of anaking through the movies is actualy pretty good
13anakin is like.... mating with the idiot ball by now
That's what I named my Geodude when I was ten.
In the Lego games Grand Master Tarkoff couldn't do anything but jump
0,14eww
I hate that freaking everybody is asking anikin "explore your feelings"
Bronysith: nahh, he cant create life, he can only preserve it with tech sttuff
Shizuka: him and the Idiot Ball are one and the same
And at no point does Anakin ask "how do you know that?"
the political and stuff might be good
A brick is smarter than Anakin
He knows they know
ohorriblre lier
LET THE HATE FLOW THROUGH YOU. DO NOT HESITATE. AND YOUR TRANSFORMATION TO THE DARK SIDE WILL BE COMPLETE.
Your thoughts are LOUD Anikan...
Fou_Lou: yeah definitely
but the love and personal scenes are just- painful
quartz ?
why did the chosen one have to be such a moron?
I knew the emperor was called Palpatine before I saw episode 1 so I was at a huge disadvantage for being surprised by anything in this.
inb4 bullshit
XylemTube: he is not the chosen one thats why
0,14same, Tovler
Shizu: Soon there will be little baby idiot balls bouncing around
Yes i do
Hm
13and they'll kick off three more movies
I think I'll use Mica.
i use passion for power lol
13don't remind me ><
nobody is selfless
Yeah, Mica sounds nice.
God even a Ewok is more competent than Anakin!
....sorry, threw up a little in my mouth at the thought of Hayden nude.
who is Hayden?
Do we really have to hear it?
Shizuka: atleast those ones are good
Shards.
Darth Palagus The Wise
0,14Anakin's actor, Vivix
Mica as in Sumica?
Ooh
13darth pelagiad?
LOS PLAGUS
DARTH REVAN BETTER
um, "darth" and "wise" don't go together.
The young guy there?
Where is Leon when you need him?
Dark side is not evil
Shards is good
otakon: nope
it's just negative emotions
Darth Terribus
its dark
Mica's a kind of rock
Dark is not always evil
inb4 more bullshit
It's shiny, iirc
otakon: but i am a gray sith
otakon: emporer palagius the mad
/me yawns
name one diamond tiara
cratorkid: nice
PinkiePieYoshi64: it actually does. There where some intelligent sith out there
We get it! He's evil!
Darth Nihilus?
otakon: darth revan wasnt evil
dark side is hipster
force is unnatural? Noooo
cratorkid: where is his pelvis?
/me refuses outright
Bronysith: not really no
I am aghast, sir. AGHAST.
but that is the way of the Sith
Shamroc: yoda has it
GET ON WITH IT
really
A Star Wars Nerd (a friend of mine -.-) once told me that this "teacher" was Palpertines teacher
Darth Obliterus
sapphire shores ?
Get on with IT!
That's not ironic.
YEA GET ON WITH IT
Tovler: Darth Nihlus
/me gives Shamroc a big friendly hug
That's just dumb.
13not from cheddar?
Get to some action already! GOD, how long it'll take!
Lil_B: he was
Glint.
GET
Lil_B: i think
ON
Bronysith...get off me..
WITH
IT
Good now there's action!
Shamroc: not on you
THis isn't suspicious at all
wookies!
Tovler: was literally a "hole" in the force... he was less man and more force of nature.
wookies
Thanks :D
that scene wasn't TOO painful
Wookies!
13if comcast plays nice, i will see what actiony stuff i have to wake us all up after this movie
YAY WOOKIES!
Zoness?
Glint is good
i wonder how many nigerian email scams Ani fell for...
jedi and sith arent actually that different
Final-freakin'-'bout time!
COOKIES
Meanwhile, thank you very muhc.
Yeah I think the best way to experience the prequels is to just play Lego Star Wars
*much
Bronysith: your hugging me...that counts as being on/touching me
Now, you get to see some kickass stuff
We must find Chewbacca.
No option to rewind means that that was more dialog than I can take.
Np.
clones why u die from one shot
CHEWY!
sounds legit
There's Chewbacca!
/me drops Shamroc ....then glomps him
hey everyone
Yes it is Chewy
hiya Thrackerzod
Chewbaccas...CHEWBACCAS EVERYWHERE
WHY DID THEY SHOEHORN CHEWY IN HERE?!
SpadeManges[R]: Oh yeah... right? Looks a bit like Zoness, except the polluted water...
Yay, I haz names, now I am less stressed.
Bronysith: Fan service.
Because they wanted to.
for fucks sake Bronysith stop bugging me......
otakon: wait. Darth Nihilus is canon? I was just making up Darth names.
Tovler: yh Nihlus is canon
No movie, go back to Chewbacca!
Tovler: he was in KOTOR2
0,14oh man, the Kashyyk level in Battlefront was fun
dat green armor
GO BACK TO CHEWBACCA!
When do we get to the good series?
I like it
My reaction to this movie so far: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3337-1330498982497.gif
I guess Star Wars exist in other media. I only watched the moveis.
13WE WANT AN ACTION SCENE! YAAAAAAAAAAAA!

SaxyPretender: battlefront 1 or 2?
"Then now, the time is, Commander." THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

@SaxyPretender: Is was better to snipe on that level too :D
I need to star playing these SW games or at least watch some LPs

Midnight_Fyre: wow, those are some crappy complaints. i enjoy them and there is nothing wrong, its kinda hard to make 3 prequal movies to even line up with the first 3 anyway
NOW MOVIE ITS YOUR TURN
Acording to Joshscorher, if you combined all the 2D Clone Wars episodes, it is the same legth as a movie.
Not once did Hellfire play in that level
BOOOOM
did the stream get interrupted?
Choose me or, your pyre.
In the meantime....have fun with this: http://i1077.photobucket.com/albums/w467/CriticKitten/BS%20Images/Anakinbuffering.jpg

Well, Disney Villains are always directly responsible for their own deaths.
and I am not really remembering them at all
Yes it's back on.
VenHur96: smosh lol
there we go
but this still seems pretty poorly written
except Maleficent.
She was stabbed then fell.
but its so silent
Tovler: True, if they don't want to die they shouldn't be villains
i see limeV stills hates me

twilight_sprinkle: No she hadn't. Are you sure you've watched this film before? She makes the effort at the last minute of the movie to bring him back.
NO
StinkomanFan: Who cares?

hi Phase4 :)
Some one needs to Suplex Grevious
at least a cool fight is coming up
aww..I missed tonight's movies :(
oh hai Phase4
CriticKitten: he says " you turned her against me", in his mind she already has, because she didnt agree with him
twilight_sprinkle: And he responds with irrationally claiming that she brought Obi-Wan there to kill him.
I wish I could sense a plot
05the death star was originally the good guys design
twilight_sprinkle: That is most definitely an irrational fear.
05that the empire stole
05:P
:c
I just got back from Target - new pony toys are out :)
Wait what was the purpouse of the station orgionaly?
Wrek, why are you awake? Vacation hours?
CriticKitten: are you kidding me.
Ki Mundi.
Wrek|Observiking: but wasnt it already from the bad guys?
Spoilers much?
Wreky :3
Lol nice room.
the yoda who cried "Dark"
Cypresswolf: still looking shitty as always?
It's all black and dark looking.
Why does he look like some one from Hogwarts?
lel
lol
YES! more Anekin whining
CriticKitten: he.said. "you turnED her against me", he already choked her to death because he thought she had betrayed him, he thought obiwan already turned her
Same budget on costumes
More whining.
STOP WHINNING!!!!
http://cheezburger.com/6465247232
Wrek|Observiking: Technically the chancellor's playing both sides so it was never in "good" hands
one hour!
THIS IS WHINING
:'( = Anakin
OOOH
idiot
more awkwardly edited silence
THE HARNESS IS TOO TIGHT~!!!
AND SO IS THIS CHAIN!!
Enough with the flamewar.
cachi01: actually they look pretty good - Shining Armor & Cadence castle set, Rainbow glittery blind bag ponies with the green male pony is out too
HIS SITH LORD :O
CAN'T YOU LOOSENE IT? :'(
twilight_sprinkle: It's only AFTER that sequence that the "you turned her against me" bit even comes up.
PinkiePieYoshi64: gently please?
Look at that rocky wall.
05Obsidian: true but the separatists could be counted as the gooder guys seeign as the empire is born from the republic
ofc he does you IDIOT!
otakon: okay :P
hiya Wrek|Observiking
Why is Anakin listening to this monkey?
Suspicous.
WHATS WITH THE SHOT REVERSE SHOT?!
SpadeMagnes[R]: bad writers
To be cool.
Maybe
circle strafing
why are they going around in circles?
Spade: Because he's full tilt idiot now.
Wrek|Observiking: except for the fact that the seperatists were a design of Sidious and well... spoillers
Now...kill palpatine!
nope
What you say to me?!
To me I belive there is no true good and evil
Falco: Are you gonna listen to that monkey?!! Boss: Ahh... you're not as stupid as YOU LOOK!!!!!
CriticKitten: didnt you see his reaction when she said obiwan told her?? what kind of critic are you if you cant see obvious acting??
KILL IT
Now's your chance!
kill him!
KILL HIM NOW BOY
KILL IT NOW
Kill him now
What can be seen as good for some can be evil for others

Kill him now: episode 4 -6 cancelled
Kill him!
Kill him now and end the movie
13oh god he's enjoying this
twilight_sprinkle: The kind who watches the movie and pays attention? You need to watch the end of this film more carefully. I suggest you do so when it comes up. :P
He's a PERV!!!
He won't do it. Because how will he explain to the other Jeid?
He doesn't because he is a moron
KILL HIM!
creepy
Shizuka: eewwwww
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
13viviiiiii :<
Cut him...into 2 pieces
twilight_sprinkle: it looked like sidious was getting off on anakins rage lol
Lick it. Lick the lightsaber
damn u anakin :(
I can taste you anger... it tastes bittersweed!
Anakin's ears: successfully tickled.
11,01Wrek|Observiking: If he did that, there would be no original trilogy.
He's getting off on this. 0.O
this is again WHY varder is better
Anakin FUÂ°! -_-
Why doesnt Anakin just... I dont know.. LEAVE?!
05yeah thats why i told him to jab him
At least tie him up and then kill him when the rest of the jedi show up!
funny you should say that Nittany_Discord
oh oh oh Shizuka is this the part where that one part happens?
SpadeMagnes[R]: bc he's afraid for Padme and the visions of her death
Ugh..
13still not as good a chase scene as OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO wubwubwubWUBWUBWUBWUB
I really like that Lizard's Mane!
CriticKitten: ok im done. ill enjoy yhe movie, you can continue ignoring obvious things and hating it because you want to for the next hour.
John Williams is being narcoleptic it seems.
GO HENRY GO!
We need some epic music!
WAAUUULLLPP!!!!
WAAAUUULLLPPP!!!!!
I wonder if this is where dubstep came from?
So many pixels
welcome back, John Williams
Suddenly epic music appears lol
RosePetal1: I've noticed ALL the action scenes in this have very little music
:D
execute order 66 anyone ? :>
FINAL PHASE GO
twilight_sprinkle: I hate it because it's bad. You like it because you didn't pay attention. That's cool, I agree to disagree with you.
The original had very epic music.
Time to finish this boss fight
Now fight!

Cause it's logic.
Total boss fight
A lightsaber couldn't kill him...
hehehe
CriticKitten: do you hate it because YOU find it bad or because it is considered bad?
So uncivilized.
But a pistol did..
I've never seen that happen to anyone else shot with a blaster
/me glomps LadyCanary
Call OCP
/me ninjas all the loot

i just realized one can say "sigh
Anakin and Samuel both are shocked by that buffer -_-
Bronysith: its war, everyone is going somewhere. and no, they talked a lot during meetings, and villains always walk slow, in every, frigging,movie
CriticKitten: ok i see.
*Fixes cachi01* There ya go, fella :D

Nittany_Discord: i've got it. try refresh again?
Fou_Lou: Agreed.

Refreshed :d
Seasons is the only game I have played that requires you to do a trading sequence to find a dungeon
you like the Cox dontja mica :S
why is a yelling actor a jedi
CriticKitten: he was clearly not fit for the job and it was obvious that hes easylie manipulated
...
OOHH MYYYY
OH MY
00,10especaly the CoX bundle
XD
Trying to get the dungeon in Tarm Ruins with out doing the sequence is impossible
reverb
CriticKitten: not to mention he had no clue of politics
Sumica: Cox be my latter name.
Should have brought him along. Then Anakin would have seen the Jedi killed in front of him and would have more likely sided with you, Windu, you dipshit. >_>
a bundle of cox?
is there any stream
I want me that new Google high-speed
yay
yaay

Is Palpatine possesed or something?
twilight_sprinkle: hayden is good as an emo brat
Xylem maybe he Vader got smarter over the years?
heh, Palpitoad is a Pokemon and Ash owns one.
Yoda man, you aren't looking so well dude
He fried his throat that's why.
luna is missing all the movie :(
So he got smoker lungs?
Bronysith: yeah lol, but the point of the shadow was more to demonstrate the split as well of emegrence of the darkness
SpadeMagnes[R]: nope but the dark side came out
/me Darth Vader is walking through that door........he just left Mace Windu crashing through the floor (that's the lyrics)
twilight_sprinkle: yup
Bronysith: and epic scene incoming
he looks like David Gilmour after he aged
Wasnt Palpatine evil even during the clone wars?
SpadeMagnes[R]: not obviously, no
SpadeMagnes[R]: He was playing both sides
Not sure.
Vader apparently has no goddamn will of his own. >_>
Enough!
funny... Civil War happened anyways... an the only 2 Jedis left weren't there
SpadeMagnes[R]: palpatinewas a sith lord inEp1 too
SpadeMagnes[R]: he was a sith all the time
SpadeMagnes[R], he's always been evil, his evil has only now been exposed
SpadeMagnes[R]: he was still acting like a chansellro but secretly evil
I never liked Nute Gunray
"PEACE"
I just adore that dancing-

11,01Peace through death.
Why is Anakin just going along with this?
0,14'sup 501st?
Peace through killing innocents. Seems legit.
SpadeMagnes[R]: Because he's a fucking idiot.
now his official Darth Vader
so begin the galactic empire
Because he is stupid
Peace by killing children
SpadeMagnes[R]: his mind is warped at this point
twilight_sprinkle: "from my point of view the jedi are evil" coming from the guy who just murdered a bunch of children. you have to admit that line is stupid
Spade: Because ....Meanwhile got it
You mean younglings.
SpadeMagnes[R]: because he belives palpatine
this is why the Nightswatch never have girlfriends
SpadeMagnes[R]: dont forget that palpatine is a sith and can use mind influence
SaxyPretender: AWW YEAH
Doesn't he remember that little ''PEACE'' parade at the end of Ep I? NEITHER DO I
SpadeMagnes[R]: the dark side corrupts
GO!
SaxyPretender: eh, nnothing. just a little massacre tonight.
Isn't that the kinda writing that gets fanfics thumbs down?
look at dat cgi
Also why would you program a order that kills all the jedi into all the clones?
I like how they all miss Obiwan
Ending a conflict through the genocide of one side. It's among the worst forms of peace.
twilight_sprinkle: So can Jedi. :p
Little does he know.
Execution Order 66... *Looks up in guidebook* Hmm... this is the code for a Universal Ponyfied Takeover.... :D :D :D :O :D :D :D
Palpatine has mind tricks powerful enough he could probably control jabba
Bronysith: same thing i just said to spade, that and Anakin is still afraid to lose padme
Spade: Because Deus Ex
code 66
EXECUTE ORDER 66
Excecute Order 66!
NO!
ORDER66
Little does he know...........IT'S ATRAP
Commander Keen
WHO WOULD PROGRAM THAT
order 666
Bronysith: he pretty much just lying to himself now
oh ****!
"Damn i just gave him back his lightsaber"
IT'S A TRAP
How can they do this!
Becuase the higher ground gives you the whatever increase that joke talked about
MISS!
SpadeMagnes[R]: because the Clones werent ordered by the jedi
Order 66 -Instant betrayal
NO, Not the Lizard!!!
NO HENRY NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Man where did the storm trooper go from badass soldiers to can barely hit the side of a barn.
Traitors! :O
NO not the lizard!
ded.
clones are epic
HENRY NO!
noooooooooooooooooooooooou
<3 clones
NOOO!!!! Not that lizard!!! :o
R.I.P. Henry
:'(
CriticKitten: the dark side is stronger, plus anakin had personal issues, which yoda warned about...
11,01Order 66 has an extra provision. They must gain terrible aim.
OH MY GOD THEY KILLED HENRY!

0,14iirc, there was at least ONE squadron that didn't enact Order 66
Isnt this a level in Unleashed?
WHY DIDNT SHE SENSE THAT!
NO!
NOOOOOO
damnit
twilight_sprinkle: Now you're just messing with me. The dark side is NOT stronger. That is a defining principle of the ENTIRE Star Wars series.
Overkill much.
not the twi'lek!
wow, a Jedi caught off guard
MY YODA
Oh no Yoda.
poor yoda :(
NOES
66
USE A SOMER SAULT
poor Yoda
NOO!!! Not Kit Fisto!!!
CriticKitten: its not more Powerful, but it does have a stronger influence on the psyche, which was mentioned a lot
waii...
wrong guy
NO NOT KIT!
xD
00,10master plo

SaxyPretender: Which one was that?
But they always miss!

Freinly fire!

Dan you Jar Jar! You did this! You MONSTER! :[

Dam it clones.

00,10only good thing that came from the prequals was the animated

JAR JAR, YOU PROVOKED THIS!
Why the hell would they program a kill all jedi order into the army that worked with the jedi?
KO!
Dude, you're gonna kill Yoda with TWO GUYS?
CHEWY
YODA SAID NO!
Error 37
wookies all like WTF!
Go get your army, you morons/.
This is why we DONT FUCK WITH THE GREEN GUY
No!
twilight_sprinkle: i dont think dark or light influences. Its the way you use the force that determines if youre dark or light. The force isnt dark or light. its just the force
waiting to see how Ashoka will die is why I'm watching the cartoon.
YOUNGLINGS T.T
Oh no! :(
oh noes!
not the kids
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Oh hell....
O NOES
Nooo!
Not the children!

You're going to die.
:'(
fu anakin
Not the kids!!!
FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!
oh fucking jees horrible actor
---Karma Lost---
SpadeMagnes[R]: The army is for the republic , not for the jedi
SpadeMagnes[R], because Palpatine is against the jedi
FU
....welp
KILL THE COCKNEY KID FIRST
Have mercy!
YOU MONSTER
poor Yeunglings
YOU KNOW, FOR KIDS
...
that was the worst childactor I've seen in a while
Now to go to my happy place
hes going to hell
Dam it Anakin.
00,10so many darkside points were gained that night
You Bastard! :[ not the kids :'(
Wait fall out kids cant die
crie
Fou_Lou: yoda said that the dark side corrupts, and once you step down that path you cant go back, whereas if you step down the light side you can easily turn to dark
:'( :'( :'( :'( :'( Not the happy children... :'( :'( :'(
So karma is invalad
Anekin will get beaten by the kids
Yeungling?!?! oO
LESS CRY MORE ACTION PLS
0,14Anakin's going to cut down Sunflowers
And pretend I'm hacking sunflowers
11,01He wanted to get the bad ending.
Aniken confirmed for psycho
Sumica: lol XD
00,10he went from light side 2 to darside 4 in one day
Not to mention all the Loyalty points that were lost.
0,14ninja'd JESmith71 :3
SaxyPretender: I remember that one
yay
It's a trap!
hes lucky hes not a jedi
what was that sound
IT'S A TRAP
twilight_sprinkle: Except that Episode 6 clearly defies that, Vader becomes good again.
That kid was a lvl 76 padawan
So did Yoda have a stroke between this movie and A New Hope? He seems in pretty good shape for being over 800 years old here, but looks pretty decrepit just a few decades later
dat young jedi
00,10we got a bad ass
Go kid
GO Kid we don't know!
CriticKitten: he was the first exception of the wntire history
DAMN
NOOO
ded.
ded
the kid was epic
kid was better then most
^
F YAH!
RIP epic kid
BRB.......dinner break
At least the kid fought back
twilight_sprinkle: Technically no he's not. >_>
Sumica: clearly that kid plays vidya gaems
who was this?
CriticKitten: he is. nobody else ever did that
Obi wan held his breath the longest time.
and he went passt all the other guys on that walkway without them noticing ???
twilight_sprinkle: Pssst. KOTOR.
Da wookies :'(
Not the Cookies
Skin the wookies for leatherworking
No, not the wookies :(
Croikey mate the wookies're dead.
Dat AT-RTs :O
poor Wookies :(
The adult in that scene? I think that's Leia's adoptive dad or something
11,01Too bad Vader never learns force lightning.
twilight_sprinkle: its because its easy to become dark. its easy to hate to emprace rage and stuff. On the other hand its very hard to be a jedi.
00,10I think the twi'lic that got it in the back was the one from the animated
Chewie! :d
Chabuka
ya know i just noticed all the troopers fire from the hip... they never aim down sight
:D
Chewbroccoli
Now Chewbacca and that other wookie are the only ones left.
Or is that Antillees? I can't remember
CriticKitten: the games dont count, theyve ruined everythign with them. in TFU the main hero pulled down a goddamn star destroyer with the force
yay Chewie :)
Lets all be chewie for a day
So, Yoda's going to Dagobah?
Now flee... TO DAGOBAH!
twilight_sprinkle: The entire canon plot of KOTOR (which is in canon with the Star Wars universe, so yes it DOES count) revolves around a redeemed Jedi.
We will see you soon Chewbacca.
Kandarihu: yep
Not yet
WHITE
oh?
Dat Tantive IV :O
Good memories.
Not yet Kandarihu
Well the star destroyer was allready in decaying orbit he just speed up the process
needs more white
Fou_Lou: yoda also said that the dark side overpowers the mind
i missed that on my first sitting then
No, it's never cannon.
lol hes right there
twilight_sprinkle: Luke also achieves this in the books, as do several others.
one n
Midnight_Fyre, you know what fans of anything love like crazy? CANON! We're crazy for it.
cannon is a thing canon is a concept
twilight_sprinkle: So no, it's not that unusual at all. >_>
GO!
i love the clone's ships though
twilight_sprinkle: It's difficult but not impossible.
oooh, a CIS Strike Bomber.... (Star Wars Battlefront Terms :P )
taking off and landing
CriticKitten: like i said, i dont count that because its ridiculous. and yes its extremely unusual, even if separate people did it. yoda said it many times, the dark side corrupts and overpowers the mind
We should play Star Wars Battlefront.
well, nearly 4AM. time for me to bed, methinks!
Damn it Obi Wan get better Wi Fi
nearly 11 o clock for me.
6 am
twilight_sprinkle: You may not count it, but your opinion is irrelevant. The books and games are considered canon.
good night BronyInstrumental
:>
5 am here..terirble
me too
twilight_sprinkle: because those feelings are so strong. and once you started hating its kind of a self runner. I still think its more a thing of mind and feelings than something that corrupts
i think i still have battlefront lying around here somewhere
man how did the clones aim get so bad when it switched to empire...
6 am ftw
man, even in the future Wi Fi is still choppy at long range
Hi honey. I have just killed innocents to spread peace.
HellsFortune where do you live?
CriticKitten: throughought the games and books the force has turned into magic, they tjrow fireballs, pull down star destroyers with the force, its ridiculous
HYPOCRITE EMO ARSEHOLD KID
night, Lil_B
Lil_B: israel :)
u liiiiiee
Yeah, there's an attack on the Jedi Temple.... by ME :D
Fuck you ani
fuck you
Continue being evil MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
R2 D2 "Get me the Fuck away from this lunatic!"
=_(\
HellsFortune wow, I didn't know Israel was in the same Timezone as germany :)
twilight_sprinkle: Doesn't really matter. It's canon.
Don't listen to him!
ohai Vordox
How long is left in this movie?
Lil_B: well we are gmt +2
00,10doushbag hair
NO.
Fou_Lou: but the dark side makes people crazy, otherwise they could make compromises, they never do
Hai Vordox
about 40 mins...
A few more hours.
NO!
twilight_sprinkle: Also pretty sure Force Unleashed's franchise plotline is sorta in that vein too.
Seps?
oh yea, different
Ord Mantell?
yes "different"
We still have the Yoda vs. Palaptine, then Obi Wan vs. Anakin
How many months is Padmane?
600
9 months.
HellsFortune sry, I was thinking 1 hour aha, its only almost 5 am here, but the movie will end 6am for me XD, sry
HellsFortune, it's about time we start seeing some Israeli bronies here.
CriticKitten: even if you refer to something that was made after the movies.... its still very exception for someone to turn from the dark side
CriticKitten: but dont forget that the extended univers is lower tier canon. Than the movies or the clonewars. so i would be cutious with that canon
If I recall Force Unleashed happens after this movie and before Episode 4
twilight_sprinkle: It's rare, but not impossible.
Bufferrr
Lil_B: no worries :P due to online gaming i pretty much knows every time zones in EU
Kandarihu: heh thx :P
HellsFortune, /)
Just Yoda Anakin and you.
corellian frigate, no?
Its a trap
OH LOOK, THE SET FROM THE FIRST MOVIE
It so white, just like in Episode 4 opening
tarp it is
No, we cannot go back. We have to hide.
That's because it's the same set.
Solar?
CriticKitten: yeah but people turning from light to dark as way more common, hence the light side doesnt influence the mind as much
Agree I, you mean
lava Planet
Mustafar :D
Fire PLANET!
twilight_sprinkle: i doubt that. Hate and fear does. And that are the main feelings of the dark side.
FLIPPY FLIPPY LAVA LAVA
I wanna live on Mustafar... O.O
Ok great its the lava level from Sonic 06
MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGMA!
CriticKitten: oh i see.
This must be Satand Summer Home
"Magma"
*Satans*
Magmar?
Fou_Lou: The classifications really only exist so that they can make up shitty non-canon stories whenever they want and say "it doesn't count"
Bucket of Lava-> only in Minecraft
That's not suggestive at all
"Take Care"
DAT DOUBLE MEANING
Fou_Lou: yeah but once youve allowed those feelings, you dont fight the dark side as much, so it can twist your mind
Anakins going to come here and start killing you. Have a nice day.
00,10and 20 years later they still use that same ship
dumb Nemoidians
SpadeMagnes yeah it's as long and boring
Fou_Lou: 'tis part of the reason I stop being a fan of the Star Wars franchise.
This used to be a peaceful planet. Then the fire everything attacked.
Hello weird alien.
hey everyone
Sumica it's so compfy -.-
its a trap
CriticKitten: i see ^-^
It's a trap!
tarp it is yes
>won't be able to control the star systems
TARP
Sumica: its a good ship they've affectionatly refer to it as the lolipop
star wars lawl
TARP
>Senate is gone by Episode 4
vrom vrom pow piow
Fire planet!
mmm tarp
FLIPPY FLIPPY LAVA LAVA
hi cow334 :)
GUESS YOU DUN GOOFED THAT LINE KENOBI
CriticKitten: that takes time...
meanwhile in that lava level from Sonic 06
shaka laka hoo ha ah ( traditional valcanoe chant)
the floor is lava now
Watch out R2.
Dat R2 ejection seat...
SpadeMagnes[R]: I hate sonic
hai Lil_B how are you
fire kindom
WHY ? because normally the temple is guarded by members of congress ? huh yoda ?
Stay there R2.
Mario galaxy had 2 fire planets. Take THAT, star wars.
cow334 tired, 5am 1hour of movie left :/
That looks safe constructing buildings on a geological unstable moon.
stay R2 I've got some slaughtering to do
So is this Solar or something?
wait is this part 3?
twilight_sprinkle: Yes, but he only keeps the Senate at this stage to give the illusion of democracy.
Or are we in Norfair?
Hello Time to Die!
Lil_B: cmon, u can do it :P if i can u can :P
twilight_sprinkle: no once you allowed those feelings you dont fight those feelings as hard as before. Its the same with everything once you have done something the first time the second time is easier
Lil_B: lawl well it is good do right
OHHHH SHIT
Hiya! Name's Pinkie Vader :D
if only darth mual was still alive :(
00,10that map sucks on battlefront 2

Dat Saber throw :O
yoda and obi-wan kicking ass
SSABER THROW FTW
I know.
twilight_sprinkle: Also he flubbed the line anyways, there aren't thousands of star systems as we established last night. :P
Sumica: Coruscant? I agree!
I loved Battlefront 2 :3
CriticKitten: obiwans phrase was correct for the current moment
CriticKitten, it's pretty much how any responsible government turns into a dictatorship. Too much power concentrated in too few people is guaranteed to be abused.
they are called "master" for a reason
Sumica: mustafar or the temple?
00,10no, ordmantel
and suddenly storm troopers suck
Dam it! Jar Jars still Alive!
foiled
Sumica: Yea. The Jedi Council map is mostly centered in the mddle
00,10or what ever the lava one is
HellsFortune I'll do, I made it too 5:30 this and last week :P (but I need somw water brb)
How is Jar Jar still alive?
Yes believe the guy who looks like a sorcerer
mustafar?
He's not a Jedi.
:'(
ded
Oh look, some dead kids
kids :(
CAST LIFE
Seriously, nobody consider it odd that Yoda kicks ass in this movie despite being about 880 years old, but another 20 years leaves him barely able to walk?
CriticKitten: there are billions of systems actually according to wiki
FUCK THE YOUNGLINGS
It's Children Obi Wan.
LEL
Use a pheonix down damn it!
Shooeie, he's not a Jedi
"Yay" It's a bunch of dead people
FUK DA POLESE
Uh, Yoda?
00,10perhaps he just triped yoda
Poor children.
They have no markings on them at all actually
So I think they're just napping
*cue epic music*
They did not want parents to be offended.
and back to the meeting
is Yuengling's a good beer? I've never had it before
Sumica: seems legit
deformed
he has no mercy
Make up your mind!
danm annaken went to the dark side
Midnight_Fyre: The battle with Palpatine screwed his body up. Plus 20 years of solitude can make you weaker.
noooouu
wyyyy
twilight_sprinkle: We established last night, otakon confirmed. There are a few hundred, 400 or so IIRC. :p
Dem eyes.
no wait wrong
Sabershy: Maybe . . .
Fou_Lou: he pretty much gives up on fighting the dark side, lets the influence in, and then its much harder to overcome
If found Yuengling to be too strong. I'm not much of a beer guy.
does eyes
00,10see that face that is atleast darkside 2

Obi has to fight his inner deamons
You don't need to twist every sentence.
consumed by Darth Vader
He has to kill Anakin.
Ilvl is not high enough D:
this is such a rippof of Hitler... start trouble, show people that you "know how to fix everything", get the politicians into endless voting until you get everything

Anakin Skywalker is no more...theres only Vader
Last night.
Lil_B: well, history has proven that it's a reliable system
Lil_B: It's meant to be political commentary on Bush actually. :p
Dose bad lies

Obi Wan needs the magic of friendship
aniken's always been ded. he's no different than he was in EP2
Well at least he won't whine,.

0,14see, based off of this, I still can't believe natalie portman is considered a good actress
you CAN
Znooore
Sumica there was blood when Darth maul got sliced in half
CriticKitten: why do people say everypony? everybody works too
Lawl
yay
My god, Anakin, you've slaughtered the Youngling Race!
Younglings are children who are just learing the force. But really they should call them children.
yay
padyay
00,10nah that was paint

I have to.
00,10he was coverd in it
Padayay
SaxyPretender: Ups and downs i suppose

twilight_sprinkle: i agree with you on that one i dont really like it that much but eh
Sumica: :D
R2D2 is best actor
Natalie Portman is a lovely actress. Black Swan? Freaking awesome.
oi, yoda is epic
Sumica: because the heat of the plasma seals the blood vessels
The best actors in this movie are the droids.....
A GREAT THREAT, HE HAS BECOME
CriticKitten: iT'S Always ''Furlings'' ''Youglings'' or ''Shia Lebouf'' ..........THEY'RE KIDS
Sumica: red paint fromk his shed
RosePetal1: children doesnt contain as much info, younglings mean he was betraying jedi
c3po is epic
natalie is shit in this movie
Lil_B: I agree :D
No its Jar Jar
SaxyPretender: shedid a much better job in Leon:proffesional and that was her flippin debut role
yay
YES HE IS
RosePetal1: but the word children covers all children. not only the force learners
Natalie Portman was amazing in Your Highness

Saxy: Portman IS a good actress. She's been dealt some shitty roles though.
Moar Manslaughter :D I mean... :O
0,14I mean, I'm sure she's a good actress and all, but man, most of the stuff I've seen her in doesn't convince me

OH MY GOD SO ughhhhhhhh
Keep fighting!
SpadeMagnes[R], he's a pretty hardcore Jedi. Of course he'd max those out the best he can.
CriticKitten: so NO Attachments is not an absolute?
dat TOR reference :p
Sumica: Anakin obviously specced wrong
that explains the healing the sick
0,14well, that was...SHOCKING
CriticKitten: it shouldn't have, he was prepared for Dooku it shouldn't have worked.
If that was Luna vs. Celestia... then this is... Applejack vs. RARITY! :O
Yoda one-handed a bolt of lightning in Ep2, did he forget how to do that?
oh crap
Dat Rave Party

Yoda should have used Force Choke :P
IF SO POWERFUL
WHY LEAVE
Wait...

Oh shiiii!
Don't fuck with Yoda, or God will punish you

Sumica Yoda kills anekin and Obi wan beats the emperor in a drinkeng contest
ded
RosePetal1: no force used in that choke
Literal ass kick.
RosePetal1: actually that was robohand choke
keeck
0,14and here's the reason why Yoda so broken in Soul Calibur 4
DROPKICK
The Yoda/Palpatine fight ticks me off.
yay
Why can't he just use force choke on him.
Music is... yay!
Keep fighting!
not goin to lie i really like these battels
0,14^
yeah
imagine if the council was still in session?
we coulda had a good old fashioned Jedi fist fight :(
How DA BUCK did they get in that rom!?!?
twilight_sprinkle: it seems they were more concerned in showing off the environment in this. too much cgi
Boss fight!
Imagine if there's a audience.
hater is losing bye yoda
his lightsaber is so tiny!:3
The main event of the night
woohoo
palpatine rulez, on my car with a key
So much dps
Same as Thrackerzod.
00,10cause yoda uses a bladed weapon that cuts any thing SaxyPretender?
RosePetal1: at that range when someone is swinging a energy sword at you it's kind of hard
00,10mime fight
Bronysith: like i said, its cool, and it doesnt hurt
DAT EQUALIBRIUM
FORCE CANCEL!!!
0,14well, no, it's because he's so small and jumpy
forcex2
FORCE PUSH!
Our powers are too equal.
twilight_sprinkle: but they drag it out for SO LONG
It inherently bothers me that Yoda gets beat and then just runs away like a pussy. That BITES.
The ONLY thing that keeps me awaken is the climax battles.
oops.
Whoops
there goes the shields!
Bye genorators
Whoops.
Bronysith: you wouldnt enjoy static battles like obi wans vs vader for 6 episodes
they accidentally the base
CriticKitten: well he's a Jedi not stupid
otakon: theres your explaination
Dat overheat :O
oi... you think that was important?
Man, it's thundering outside right now, as all of this fighting is going on.
METROID ESCAPE SEQUENCE?!

Stop laughing you fool!
Hai cow334 :D
I mean he can barely handle one of those carts
oh hai there Ponies47
haha xD
otakon: And yet is more powerful than Windu, who beat Palpatine's ass.
CriticKitten: i pretty much doubt windu > palpatine
LIKE A BOSS
hai PinkiePieYoshi64 how are you
NO!
and yet Palpatine was throwing tons of them
Blocked!
COOOOOOOOOORN
According to the nerds, palaptine > everyone else except vader.
C'MON YODA!
and then the fire nation attacked.
Pretty good cow334 and you?
Kabob
Fou_Lou: Windu would have killed him earlier in the film if Anakin hadn't interfered.
>_>
00,10he let windu win
discord v.s celestia
yodas pissssed
FALLING TIME
ouch
NO!
CriticKitten, It's debatable that Windu could actually beat palpatine
PinkiePieYoshi64: i am doing exelent thanks for asking
CriticKitten: oh joy, i get to explain more obvious things to the critic. have you ever considered that palpatine let windu beat him
and that is what happened to Yoda
thump
Wait he lost on purpous?
:D
laugh
Yoda ... lost :(
Ayeeeeh
00,10yoda used racial skill scamper
No.....
lost his cloak
Bronyhater is winning
nooo
i swear, the yoda vs pap fight was too short.
twilight_sprinkle: Have you considered the possibility that you're making excuses? :P
HowToFryChicken: i agree
robot
You fight like a Dairy Farmer!
How long is this fight?!
CriticKitten: i doubt that. Because palpatine plottet it that way. He felt anakin coming and deciced to get in this situation to manipulate anakin
Is this Geonosis again?
In the Lego games you had to work together while still fighting to the death
WHO CARES ABOUT THE WHINY BITCH I WANT OLD PEOPLE KICKING ASS
The place is gonna blow up.... shouldent they be getting out of here?
No Mustafar.
that shot!
twilight_sprinkle: Let's get this straight, then....Palpatine's genius plan was to lose a fight to Windu and HOPE that Anakin shows up to bail him out.
Epic shot.
ratyoda
lol yoda
Double your search!
Moostafar. Where is SuperBrony64|AFK?
Yoda is faking his own death.
Yoda is in you harddrive stealing your RAM
Come on! I wanted Palpatine vs Yoda to drag a little longer
twilight_sprinkle: I'm sorry, that's a really stupid plan if so.
Dude, the fight is long because obviously the audience was asleep for like...I don't know, the first half or something?
CriticKitten: he couldve felt him and let the battle drag on as much as he needed
who the HELL is that guy?
So in reality Yoda won.
THE SEARCH HAS BEEN DOUBLED
huzzah
^^
CriticKitten: and dont forget that they have future visions
lord vada is in dangah
This calls for a search PARTY!
inb4 I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND
The floor is lava!
toastY!
Why couldn't celestia and nightmare moon take out their rage like this :(
DAMN IT RAGNAROS CONTROL YOUR LAVA
He can sense Lord Vader in danger, but can he sense why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch?
Fou_Lou: Either that or, you know, Palpatine's just an idiot. :p
Meanwhile: haha
Meanwhile: nope
:D
HowToFryChicken: bc it's still a kids show
Meanwhile: lol
Meanwhile: no one can
inb4 I LOVE YOU LIKE A BROTHER ANAKIN!
Meanwhile EEEEEEEEnope
If this was Brawl, the Lava would have killed the other 2 players.
There's cinnamon swirls in every bite.
Meanwhile: Hahaha :D
Anakin was winning the fight until the fire nation attacked
otakon: THE FANS WILL DO THIS
hey everypony!
00,10must have been hard to set that bas up with out the shield to protect it
Tovler: XD!
How did they buid the station to begin with?
HowToFryChicken: one day, one day
hai Allegr0
Pylons.
theres no way either of them would survive this
So is yoda/palpatine fight supposed to be happening at the same time Anakin/Obi are fighting? How can Palpatine reach this other planet in an instant?
Yoda, you pansy bitch, get back in there and fight!
cow334: moo
CriticKitten: as said he knew he was coming. The whining about that hes losing his power and stuff is only a ruse. je just pretends.
Ragnaros is messing everything up
StrayPony: Magic. -snort snort-

FINAL PHASE
0,14and then errol fynn time
Look for Samus.
Epic battles! O.O
Fou_Lou: Obviously. But the problem is, what if Anakin doesn't show? Then we have to ASSUME that Palpatine would have won without any evidence on-screen to suggest he could, don't we?
Lava surfing
cow334: well....fine, you win :P
and then the heat kills them both
Allegr0: See
Bronysith: come on man, this is epic

if only
heartless Obi Wan, just put him out of his misery already!
DED
And friends, that's how the Pyro became about.
yay
SaxyPretender: O.O
inb4 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Fou_Lou: I still think it would've done more for Palpatine if he was fighting all four solo for most of the sequence.
SaxyPretender, but you're a mod
/me giggles
And Obi Wan proceeds to ninja all the loot
Fou_Lou: THEN maybe I'
No.
0,14...oh right I am
Alchemist: no time, Padme needs medical attention
SaxyPretender: just put him behind a firewall
Yea he's toasty warm
Annaken is da sizzle
the stomach wasn't that big when they arrived :/
Only problem with this series, palpatine is lazy as hell.
Hes dead, jim
NO
No he got mutilated and then burned up.
Fou_Lou: THEN maybe I'd believe that he could take Yoda.
no, he's an englishman in a dress.
He's ded.
SaxyPretender, i hate you
00,10he will be fine, the fire cauterised the missing limb wounds
yeah,his ok
AnakinSkywalker: O.O
Why dont you go ask him yourself :)
Sumica: the lightsaber already did that

Poor Obi
Sumica.,,yeah the lightsaber did that

Terminator?

hahaha
Still alive.
YAY
I'm not dead.
Termonater
So many yays
You are Terminated
Fou_Lou: Instead he wasted three nameless Jedi, nearly dies to Windu, and then I've just gotta accept that Yoda runs from him like a pansy bitch? Ugh. I hate it.
Like I said the only thing that kept him alive was his hate.
:( yay
Expansion sequel!
NOT QUITE DEAD
I WILL SURVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVVEE
CriticKitten: in that case i agree with you as i already did earlier. a real fight with all 4 or 5 of them would be better and would benefit my point too
Wait, he lived...after he been on FIRE... hooray for logic!
I FEEL FINE

HowToFryChicken, Terminator 3?
CriticKitten: wizards in space
We can rebuild him.
EVERY TERMINATOR (except that bale spoof)
this was a triumph
I know he's not bleeding from his three missing limbs, fair enough, but the guy was LIT ON FIRE BY LAVA
Can someone give me a hand please?
those Storm troopers you dont see them any more
jesus touch
im making a note here
Its funny. We all hate Anakin Skywalker, but if it weren't for if, Darth Vader doesn't exsict.
HUGE SUCCESS
00,10and then he sat there and poke at his woulds for 20 min it took them to come back
shoulda kicked him into the lava
Fou_Lou: yoda was on another planet. sending in more than 4 jedi in a room wouldnt have been efective
^
The moon.
CriticKitten: not by lava, proximity to lava
incoming meme
T3 only because arnold gets his face slammed into a bathroom stall.
Ponies47 Anakin does no longer exists..........thus Darth Vader was born
Polis Massa :D

Yoda...is masterbathing for the prequels.

CriticKitten: yes but dammit force of will is a real thing.
twilight_sprinkle: sure. but they didnt had to die so fast in the fight.
HowToFryChicken, we watched the first 3 Terminators during one of the trilogy events. It's not eligible.

Then Darth Vader.
Sumica: wasnt this on battlefront 2?
Shooeie: yes
Spitfire: the chats gonna crash when it comes to that
Those V-wings :D
Dark92Enigma: Now you're thinking!
13yep
00,10yeah
Fou_Lou: true, that was odd. maybe that was an indication of palpatines power and proof that he let windu win
OMG ITS THE DARK SIDE THEME

TWINS
HOW IS BABBY FORMED
So she's killing herself.
God dammit, this is dumb

Anakin is choking her 5 thousand miles away
BABIES!

Slap the bitch and tell her to snap out of it
That makes no sense!
I smell a meme
I hate babies -_-
Her heart :(
DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUR
CriticKitten: yeah true but some people do just give up
She's perfectly healthy, but the script says she needs to die so....
So she's medically okay... but.... I don't get it..

Dayum. Shizuka with the "STAY DOWN"
Callofdutywithraginkids

durger: they are making the hobbit
can we wtch the NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO scene in german PLEEEEAASSEEEE???
/me hugs Lil_B back
/me Hugs Lil_B back ;)
It's bad to some people, not everyone enjoys this sci fi weirdness
CriticKitten: oh well
Pudge, Three movies
/me hugs everypony in the stream, while crying with joy :'(
twilight_sprinkle: It's a mediocre film.
NNNNEEEIIIIIIINNNNNNNN!!!
/me hugs Lil_B back
WIjigjg
cachi01 in the German version vader says : NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN!!!
00,10the Korian version of the NOOOOOOOOOOOO bit is better.
NNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIN
twilight_sprinkle: But a bad Star Wars movie.
I just don't know why it took this long to do that.. it wassn;t hei first
Joke :D
NEINNEINNEINNEINNEIN
We surrived.
CrimsonPhoenix: force unleashed is oficial canon as far as i know
MUSIC
DO NOT WANT!
00,10they dont have a way to say nooooooooooooooooo
0,14Real talk: I do like the prequels, but admiteddly they're not that good.
THEME
cachi01 it's not that special in german, the "Nein" doesn't sound that epic
Now what?
Fou_Lou, NEVER
00,10so he shouts DO NOT WANT!
DRAMA
Best music here! :D :D :D
MUSIC
CriticKitten: mediocre? hell no. its better than 95% of modern movies, and its better than batman for sure.
Lil_B: :(
durger: but the only prequelfor the books i know of is the hobbit.
A poor attempt to send a stern warning about concentrating political power. Such a message needs to be sent in a better way while the freedom still exists to do it /10
Best song here in
Screw Episode I, Screw Episode II, and screw this! The prequels are the one TRUE Star Wars!
GTG guys
Bed
later StinkomanFan
Chorus: AAAAAHHHHHHHHAAAAAHHHHUUUUUHHHHHAAHHHUUHHHHHAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
Bye StinkomanFan
Saxy: Like I just said, if you take off the Star Wars label, they're average. Mediocre.
Night
bye StinkomanFan
Pudge, yeah, they're making three films out of The Hobbit
VenHur96: You just contradicted yourself.
VenHur96: this were the prquels xd
Bye StinkomanFan
CriticKitten: everyone loved cliche ripoffs like despicable me or that zombie movie too.
twilight_sprinkle: No, they're about par with a typical action movie.
See ya bronies that are leaving
If you listen closely to that singing, you can hear the butthurt of die hard starwars fans
dat text flow.
durger: dear god, I sense a lot of fliller
I give all of these movies a 3/10. Every month I have a new least favorite prequel.
filler*
Eh.
twilight_sprinkle: And they certainly don't compete with the Nolan Batmans, so I'll assume that line was just to troll. :p
Still a better trilogy then toy story
Wait... australian construction crew?
Have we watched the Aliens Trilogy?
the hell?
0,14Yep, Shooeie
idk
Shooeie: Eeyup
Come on guys! REVENGE OF THE SITH WASEN'T THAT BAD! :(
You guise watched everything :(
Im running out of movies
It wasn't.
ep 3 is the best of the prequels
Better than the Godfather Trilogy. So boooring
^^
what Pudge said
00,10they were good movie but they were meh starwars
CriticKitten: yeah, and whats so good about batman? the hero wasnt designed by Nolan, the action was ordinary, the plot twists were obvious
I liked it because I don't dwell on it.
Ponies47: It's my favorite of the prequels, actually. It's still a weak film overall though.
Still better than Twilight imo :p
Tis movie ONE MILION MONEY
/me agrees with Pudge
:'(
I give these movies 4.5/10 Overall dissapointing, the III was better than the rest (of the prequels)............
Episode 2 was complete crap, except when yoda came in to fight dooku
Still a better story than Twilight
:'(
Have we watched the Mummy Trilogy?
minbnmp
Episode 1, same shit, except Maul saved teh film.
/me cant keep up with the chat :D
YEAH LETS ALL RATE DA MOVEH
CriticKitten: It's may fav of the prequels
http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
:p
appleclouds ? why sad?
What if....We shopped raptors into every frame in Twilight?
STAR WARS THEME QUEUE
You see folks, whenever you tried to make a 3 movie in a trillogy, like Spiderman 3 or Shrek the Third, or tryed to make a newer trillogy to an already existing one, it's just not right.
my speakers being plugged into my computer is STILL a better love story than twilight
twilight_sprinkle: I don't respond to obvious trolling. You really just don't want to accept that these movies were panned with good reason and you're throwing jabs at everything else you can find.
Is there a chick flick trilogy somewhere?
Instant NOOO Button hahahaha
did I see the name : PETER JAKSON come by?
Is it a no to the Mummy trilogy?
But then there's Toy Story 3...
skywlker sound
I am saving that no button
How about the Bourne Trilogy?
Shooeie: please no
0,14saw that too, HowToFryChicken
I can't frickin believe they're making a fourth one.
TOY STORY TRILOGY
05ep 2 and 3 could jsut aswell have been 1 entire movie. but they had to make 2 and add alot of useless filler inbetween. now lets watch LOTR again

0,14How about the Dollars Trilogy? >..

My dad called Kingdom Hearts Kingdom keepers... and pokemon pokeman

SpadeMagnes[R]: POKEMAN LOL
My grandpa calls the Wii the W I2

Pokemon = Poke a man typical japaese fad
I'll give my grandpa a break given he's about 80...
what does I.E. mean
CrimsonPhoenix what interview? I didn't hear it.
Internet Explorer
internet exzplorer?

superretroworld I don't knwo him.

's wlal mart has shitty security
The cameras mostly dont work
A sniggle is a combination of a giggle and a snort, as seen in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymKvFYG7mGM
Lunar_Brony: hes a talk show host on tbs, hes pretty famous
05how so lunac?
superretroworld I know who he is.
Lunac, have you seen or heard anything he's done since the TV show ended?
*thought
Pinkies4thWall: dat Pinkie<3
HEYEEEEEAYEAYAEYAEAEYEAYAEYYAEAEYAEYAEYAEYAEYAE

O.o
Does anyone know what those black bar things on some game packages are?
Oh FUCK
He actually hated, and I mean HATED, doing the TV show.
WHATS GOING ON?
I always peel those off
why isn't this with the original song
why is it always the cut version
MahBoi777: leave it on all night
Lunac I'm intriegued, although I have no idea what to expect. I've never seen one of his shows.
cachi01: THE STREAM HAS STARTED!
Godda...... i was free of that song for at least a week or more ....
spartan133t: I KNOW IM SINGING LOL
Lunar_Brony: then why did you say i dont know him?

cachi01: MADNESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
MYAAAA!!!!!
Is it true the game boy games can actually die after awhile?
05no i meant your question regarding european streamers
meaeah
SpadeMagnes[R]: didnt knew
twilight_sprinkle: Glad I'm not the only one...
SpadeMagnes[R] yea, the batteries in them only last a couple of years
The TV show was crap. If you get a chance, listen to him on the radio. He's good on the radio.
SpadeMagnes[R], only the ability for the cartridges to hold a save.
SpadeMagnes[R], there's a memory chip inside that runs out after a while
that cook
or batteries...
superretroworld I don't remember what I said. I knew nothing about him before today except he hosts a talk show.
SpadeMagnes[R] but you can replace them
I still own a gameboy copy of Gold and Silver
lowfn: yeah, im glad im not the only one as well
Oh I'm still new here WrekObserviking and I'd happily stream too if allowed.
SpadeMagnes[R], I'm sorry for your loss
I HEAR ZE CLICS

Pinkies4thWall: si seniore
o.o?!
Well its... almost 1 Am so I should get to bed I have a dentist apointment tomorrow
