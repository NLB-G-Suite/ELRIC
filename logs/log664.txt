Yep
Gnight everypony :)
13so you hire someone to do the fixing
k wats ur friend code and Mii name
hey
Uh Oh, we're suddenly in the intro to STEEL
13this scene isn't as fun in the book
Kill men
???
13if i recall the book only claimed 100mph
hi all
13i doubt you could find enough clearance to get a train to survive 250mph through the rockies
good
Obliterating it instantly and spraying moose-bits all over the place.
how goes?
what's the movie?
okay, you?
13dat's a purty bridge
dat bridge
I just figured it'd be exciting.
13a train that long going 250 mph won't be stopped by much
13unless you're supermoose
EVERYTHING
13moose and squirrel!
Was there ever any doubt.avi
*now
13A ROOOOOOOOM
13WITH A MOOOOSE
AAAAAAAAAHHHHH
I'm ok too
13they pull off the effect of night quite well i think
13and yes that sex scene is in the book
13stuff like that about filmmaking fascinates me
hey
And now, I must leave
Night everypony
GONNA TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE
GONNA TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE
yay~ tidus is gone
I'm sure if chat's usual clients were present the reaction would have been much greater.
WOOOO PACKERS
WOOOOOOOOOOOO
13the *reason* this company failed is very interesting, spelled out in the book
They invested in BLU?
i thought i smelled a hint of communism int hat explanation
CURELOOKINGLIKEHEJUSTGOTOUTOFTHESHOWERSTARINGOFFINTOSPACEWITHASTETHOSCOPEINHISMOUTH hi.
13like the workers threw out the execs and decided they'd do everything collectively
13which failed spectacularly
13this is also in the book
13and as i said earlier there's a superweapon in part 3
13if you're willing to work past the more anvilicious anti-collectivist points and skip most of galt's speech, AS is quite an interesting book
this motor acually looks like the skalar weapon from bad company 2^^
13was more like "we'll keep working, but we're going to collectively decide wages"
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIL
13inevitably some people figured out they could just stop working and yet take home more money than their peers
13so the company imploded
13eeyup
i i ws right. they DID communism
dat symbol on the cigarette
Hm. That pit stop looks familiar. I think it was in the movie War Games
MADNESS
THIS IS SPARTA!
13he's sort of the gatekeeper for galt's gulch

*Atlas
VERY loose
I see
13and then wyatt walked away

WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE ALL THE RICH PEOPLE, AND PUSH THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE?
13just about
it itches
Hey everypony.
13come on tell me you can't hear jeff bridges in that voice :3
i hear lots of communism in that voice
"Digital jazz, man"
Or Magneto?
atlantis
13that
13is a damn good NOOOOO
aka rapture. only tthis one isnt underwater
Maybe, I haven't seen enough Bridges.
and then he became a splicer
welp, everything is fucked now
That was more like NOOAAAAAAAAA
both mythical
SUCKS TO BE YOU
13wyatt's oil field there was the last best hope for her railroad
-Yes, Mister President.

13part 2 is pretty much one gut punch after another for dagny as the country starts to crumble
We watching part 2?
13part 2 is out in november i think?
13it's this year at least
Oh I see.
13they replaced pretty much the entire cast though

Is that all?
How bad could it be.
blood tits and all dem bits

Tits? I havent seen any lucy tits
Ok, I can see why thatd be considered bad
oh did you get my message?

d
Fucking +K set....
11,01I enjoyed Elfen Lied, but it is not for the weak of stomach.
Nittany_Discords got it
11,01Like I said, the very first scene of the anime is a severed arm on the floor.
...
that
and then naked chick
Ftw
why are we discussing 4chan?
Are we?
I only talk in 3rd person when the moment calls for it
OH YEAH
/me 11,01's first movie night was Se7en and A Pig's Tale.
When does the moment ever call for talking like a twonk.
Youd be suprised by how often the moment calls for it
Twonk
Twinkies
"Twonk! Now with chocolate coating!"
/me feels like playing PIU again....
HANG ON!..........
I'm sorry that is the incorrect answer.
Is it?
Is it really?

How is Naruto, a show about ninjsa, a rip off of DBZ, a show about alien marital artists?
Trolololololol
IT IS
Naruto didn't have any MYSTICAL OBJECT to collect
like the DRAGONBALLS
Naruto has tailed beasts though.
And no one has ever died in Bleach AND came back later, unless they came back as a monster
I imagine saying Bleach is DBZ with swords is a comparison you only make if you've only ever seen the fight scenes.

>marital artists... wat
Hey guys how.many saiyans do you need to change a light bulb?

Escence of Evan. Hm.
Wait
This CD... it smells a lot like Evan
*DVD
this song....
dat ff7ac
05,15If it came out within the past year, it's too recent
Hugo?
0,14>saw title
0,14>saw fighting
Oh
Aww... May I ask why recent release dates matter?
The inventiom of.hugo
Because if they didn't... I'd really want to watch The Avengers as well...
05,15Stallion_of_War legal issues. The more recent a film, the more risky it is to show it.
0,14indeed
Actually
05,15dem C&D letters
This remix was in Dissidia!
I blame sxyprtndr.
0,14I do too-

NeverEnding Story and Star Trek First Contact are both As right?
13yes and yes
13i used this for battle music in morrowind, usually didn't get more than thirty seconds in
Haven't seen Avengers yet.
Not really missing much.
^
05,15Captain America was pretty good.
0,14and probably Thor
Inb4 shitstorm
/me Smiles
05,15I really liked it. Thor was also great.
Thor was missing his helmet
0,14I enjoyed Avengers all the way through
13the OCRemix album for FF7 is pretty awesome
Avengers IMO was the best movie I've ever watched
Is that
That's Cosmo Canyon from Voices of the Lifestream
*Action movie
YEEEEEAAAAAH
0,14only OC remix song I have is an awesome one of Ken's SF2 theme
Avengers. 4/10 where was Superman.
13that bass
13so much thump
13while we're on an OCRemix kick
g2g
0,14also also, dat feel when SSF2THDR came out and it was done by OCRemix
Meh...So how's everyone tonight?
Whedon.
0,14fun factL Favreau graduated from my high school
I was avoiding mentioning Whedon because I kind of hate Whedon's writing 90 percent of the time.
05,15that was a Favreau film if I recall
0,14yep
Goddamit Winamp, why won't you apply my skin?
Well let's be honest
The name
05,15Last movie I saw was the newest Resident Evil movie, and I wanted to burn that theatre by the time that was over
05,15Unquestionably the worst movie I have ever seen
I laughed when I heard that title for the movie. :D
05,15Worse than Babes in Toyland
0,14Shizuka, it was that bad it swore you off theaters?
13no
13then baby sister happened
0,14^
0,14ah
0,14I actually liked it
13i'd rank it above temple of doom anyway >>
0,14same
13that too
Nuking the fridge :/
/me has never seen any of the Indiana Jones movies
No one survives nukes by hiding in a fridge.
Also, six movies is too much for a franchise. ANY franchise. END IT ALREADY.
/me punches her Winamp
Indiana Jones and the movie that no one ever watches?
that's why it's awesome :D
0,14I'm going to assume all the various deities cut Jones some slack for that one
Harry Potter had 7 books and 8 movies
You don't understand though guys. They used to make refrigerators out of Nokias
7 books. 8 movies. you can't explain thta.
that*
i can explain it!
05,15I can explain it with one symbol
05,15$
13isn't star trek's rule that every other movie sucks? or every third or something
Technically it's English to it'd be £
Just divide the last by 2 and thats it.
05,15Every Odd numbered Star Trek is bad
05,15The even ones are good
0,14KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANfound it
"Star Trek Into Darkness"
...
no, I'm not missing a colon there
Please say you're lying.
:D
1st movie with VGER was ok,
To boldy go where no one has shone a light before...
KAHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN was good
0,14Tron Legacy music?
0,14YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Search for spock was good
worst name I've heard since A Good Day To Die Hard
^
Yes
05,15Sketch_Toku_Brony yup
5 of the One Piece Movies were good.
:I
KAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
...
2, 4, 5, 6, and 10
I'm going to
Go write something?
Anything to forget that for now.
05,15Why does this sound like Deus Ex

11,01K. Glad you read the rules.
And this is where I'd put my copy of The Avengers IF I HAD ONE

*points at chat* and this is where I'd put my fucks...IF I HAD ANY
05,15Kandarihu those are special
Hard.
13casino royale is the only bond i've seen
05,15Sean Connery is the best Bond though
0,14also, i liked Casino Royale
nah nothing really
Pierce Brosnan is going to nut you.
Quantum of Solace...I don't remember much of that, to be honest.
it's probably one you're wanting. it's 80 bucks though
Also, I believe Casino Royale was basically Bourne only in Bond form.
Pierce Brosan in best Bond :$
They turned bond into a muscle bound action start I can't forgive them for that.
0,14one of my favorite parts of Casino Royale was Vesper and Bond just breaking each other down
13mixed with Robots FTW here is Going to Another Place by Mannheim Steamroller
0,14ha
05,15Goldfinger was fantastic
Octopussy
It's totally aginst everything bond he get's through on his wits and gadets .
Is that
Octopussy :D
Good grief.
And I'm back :3
ive watched most bond mvies at some point
13yes it is a thing
WHY DO I EVEN NEED TO EXPLAIN THAT?
YOU GUYS SUCK AT WATCHING BOND.
05,15Meanwhile I know that of which you speak!
0,14I tried watching Dr. No as a kid, couldn't do it
/me shrugs, having not watched many Bond movies
05,15A View to Kill was good
I havint seen half of them but i need to track em down :/
Sigh. Stream needs a Bond week.
05,15OH SNAP ANIMUSIC
i still need to watch Goldeneye :/
05,15It's like I'm in 8th grade all over again!
I think I watched From Russia With Love...also I think I watched Die Another Day?
13X3
Yep Haven't seen any Bond movies.
>Moonraker
13is 3 out yet?
Heh they just played the bond theme on tv :/
0,14see, I know Die Another Day is considered to be really bad
0,14like, really, really bad
0,14but I liked it
05,15No idea. I didn't even know a 3 was in the works
Animusic?
13pretty sure there's a 3 coming
0,14can you guys guess why I liked Die Another Day?
13i should stream animusic again
05,15Reikim music...and animation
05,15YOU SHOULD
13was a fun restream back in february :3
Trying to remember die another day.

Yeah catwoman was bad
I hate, hated Catwoman.
I think anne hathaway has done the best catwoman.representation
I only hate it more now that I'm older because I know it completely neutered (...haha) her backstory.
13doom was fun :3
Catwoman was......*sticks finger in back of throat*
I want to unwatch that movie.
0,14^
^
0,14best part
Doom was like, "Hey look it's The Rock-the movie"
13i liked that the movie borrowed more from doom 3 than the first 2, 3 actually had a world built up
^
No Saxy
13don't do it saxy
13you'll regret it
No seriously I mean this.
05,15Well, a Doom 2 movie would just be 2 hours of dudes getting shot. and that's it
0,14PFFT
>watch
You don't understand, Saxy.
13well doom 2 had a story of our hero kicking the demons off earth
0,14you guys have no idea how bad I wanted to see it in theaters
13so not as well folded in as doom 3
0,14Ryan Renolds
05,15Ryan Renolds
Saxy had you gone to see it in theatre you would probably be passed out drunk outside a pub even now.
Fuck. him.

0,14Frank Miller's old! And Washed up!
I just want to see you rage, Saxy.
LOL~
0,14also, this is awesome!
His name is like an unspoken curse
05,15I liked it then, but it was probably terrible
Snipers in the ski lift. All the damn time.
To even think it is to bring doom to us all
13oo that reminds me
0,14also also, now that I think about it, Goldeneye was my first FPS ever
13somehow..
05,15SaxyPretender me too

0,14physics stupidity aside
They don't bounce like that, not even with implants
Also DOA5 is pretty tame. It's all right, although I still find it too bouncy. (Note: the other half of my brain is currently beating the other half with my brainstem. Just noting.)
Bouncy tits 5 is out?

I keep watching it but it still fails to make sense
and you know what's worse guys? EIKEN isn't the worst anime I've ever seen.
See, I've only seen clips of that show and I recognised the anime :D
^ HM?

Welp, on that note. 4:30 doesn't seem like a bad time to hit the hay.
Night everyone.

13this is only 30 minutes
05,15ah

0,14oooh this is catchy
...Wait you guys weren't taught Roman numerals in school?

It's a good thing I never bothered to watch> :D
Lol
I just realised; Winamp.
0,14so in other news
if the stream weren't going, I'd post a link to the infamous "Matrix Boob Scene" from HSotD
05,15yaaaaaay
LOL ---> 4chan <--- LOL
0,14oh
Really?
0,14or borth
0,14....

I could get away watching that for animation and fanservice?
But then, if I wanted animation and fanservice, there's a hundred other things I could be watching.
Not watching.
Or
Dammit
also, STILL not the worst anime I've seen.
You're making me want to watch this now out of morbid curiosity.
Orgy bus XDDD
0,14I'm liking this speech
0,14or bad
There's this sick, terrible feeling of awful curiosity you get sometimes. You know?
And now I've got it for HSotD.

ANYWAY
DINOSAURS ON A SPACESHIP
Well shit
it's gore 'n' titties masquerading as something deeper.
05,15Matt Smith is just.....not doing it for me. He's okay, but I feel like he's getting worse.
Anyway, Dinosaurs on a Spaceship felt really weak to me.
05,15And I just feel dirty whenever River Song shows up
05,15RAWRity I figured that was the issue.
0,14The Buster Wol-
SHE WON'T STOP
00,10dari would like to be the one to show 10th
You don't get to name spaceships after terrible FG moves.

Lain. That one...intrigues me.
00,10this ep is a bit mind fucky
Can't be any more mindfuckery than Paprika.
in a little bit c.c
Like, it gives you all the information necessary to understand it, but never sits down to explain it to you. It expects YOU to connect the dots.
Ouch
g2g see ya guys
13i have paprika here
13maybe should do that some time
DUDE LOOK FORWARD
Paprika was fun for the animation and mind fucky. That one scene though was...kind of really creepy.
EST?

i sigh up and it wont let me play
I like shows that fiddle with the idea of reality
Memories?
how come?
waaaiiit
i dont know
isnt japan you know... asain?
There was an anime film, a series of shorts, called Memories. It was pretty mindscrewy. I watched it back when I was still watching Naruto. About the same time I left Naruto behind.
00,10Shizuka, probably can explain it best
I also can't type tonight.
13explain this ep? this one weirds me out too :3
lol
"Reset the World." And suddenly I think of RahXephon.
Che Guevara o.o
13yay~

And thyere is the definition of a Conspiracy Theorist.
13those confuse me even more this season :3
0,14AKIHIKOOOO
00,10oh hi section 9

O HAI
13i think because 2nd gig has three categories of episode rather than season 1's more consistent arc i get lost easier
Dat hair

Very few women in this world can unironically wear that haircut.

an adam's cantaloupe
an adam's WATERMELON
13oh i can sum up this episode

"To a machine, all reality is virtual." ;)

soo the OCRemix Kickstarter for the FF VI Album is back again :) pledget 50$ immidietrly and I hope it reaches 45k soon :)
I'm not sure they'll reach that goal, considering you can get the whole album on their website for free.
That's mostly why they didn't reach their goal the last time
Heh, goes to show how much I pay attention. :P
that's me .-.
I see
Ha!
currently 34k of a 30k goal XD
Well then
I just want them to reach 45k, because that means I'll get a physical print of Voices of the Lifestream too :P
XD
Magnets are magic. :D

Basically, yes.
Aye, same here.
But I had to wait weeks to get a Machina.
Soooo, you can buy a Salvaged 40 crate for 10 keys, open it, and get a strange item worth 14 keys.
I was on the verge of buying one until I got one in a drop.
I buy nothin in TF2
I've only paid for 2 keys.
Same
Got a Strange persian persuader and a strange detonator.
Screw the detonator, Demoknight all the way.
I only like the Machina because I use a controller to play
Gah, that microphone is loud!

O.o
no flstudio compresses them
and then my brain went to mush
Idk...

benben
Hubby wants to move to Indiana. That's where he calls home.
I wish I could visit the states someday.
Lol
.... ugh
i drove up there once...
Or Ohio. Then we'd be closer to Cedar Point. lol XD
its in the middle of nowhere
Heart*
Gotta ove that Europe
litterally between here and there in the middle of nowhere
*love
whos seen terminator?
XD
meh, nowhere more intresting than there
I'm always here, but never there.
I'm never ever anywhere.
Excepting here, 'cause here is where I'm in. :P
I'm mostly a indoor recluse. :U
I avoid going outside like the plague.
i would spend some time, but my family smokes
Which is why I have cats, and not dogs. Cats don't require going outside.
someone is always smoking
Only people that live in this house are me, my husband, and my two cats, and none of us smoke. :P
everyone but me smokes =_=
That sucks. :(
one member smoked, then another memeber picked it up, and then it spread to everyone
this birthday someone gave me a horrible chestcold which left me with asthma
I don't smoke as well, and neither does anyone in the family.
smoking is supposed to be claming
and they hook you with nitotien
accidtion
Well, it IS an addictive substance.
Much like alcohol.
Does anyone of you drink?
I drink, but only on occasion.
I'm 18 and I can. :D
'Murica
And I had my first drink at 18. :P
You can drive from 16 but no alcohol until 21, is that right?
Right
Yep
meh
i don't bother voting
and you become legal too, but nowadays, thats pretty much pointless :D
^
How does it even work?
And how much do you usually get?
^
Average?
Oh, I see.
is there a stream?
ok
And you're just halfwawy through? Damn.
Makes me glad the education here is basically free.
Oww.
ack, my mouth is going to be stuck like this at this rate
Except they can't take away the knowledge you got from the education.
I guess.
Sometimes up to $200
Pff, that's like a third of an avarage salary here.
Lol
It's not very much. It's actually one of my cheaper bills.
Oh damn
Mortgage is the monster bill we work around every month.
When you rent, you pay rent. =)
When you buy, you pay mortgage
And a fixer-upper at that
Brb, transfering into my currency
Well damn, that's a lot.
Yeah...
Basically an average salary here :D
It sucks, but at least we can still afford the payments
I try not to think about it. Thinking about it makes me a sad pony. :<
That's good therapy :D
Lol
filler episodes. cant tell em apart.
so...whats been going on in here?
Not a whole lot.
why am i still here again?
dunno.
lol)
I know why /I'M/ in here.
Just today I've learned that my I could get to Norway via student exchange programm.
if my grades were high enough, I could study in England or Luxemborg...but why would I do that?
Yeah, why would you want to come to England?
It's crap.

welcome back
Hai errybady
I did like both KH 1 and 2, but I would agree that 2 is where the story took a nosedive
I enjoy KH games
KH <3
I enjoyed KH2 more than KH1, but after that, the games got ridiculous with the Organization XIII backstory...
Or lack thereof
*shrug* They just felt like "more advanced" monsters to me. Fitting for a sequel, I think.
