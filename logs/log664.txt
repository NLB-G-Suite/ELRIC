alexxm: atlas shrugged
Yep
thanks Dark_Horst
Gnight everypony :)
13rapture's engineers would have started out by repairing things themselves, though the progress of the city would slow because their effort is directed at maintenance rather than innovation
bye Michael
13so you hire someone to do the fixing
NIght, Michael :)
k wats ur friend code and Mii name
hey
Uh Oh, we're suddenly in the intro to STEEL
bai Michael
13this scene isn't as fun in the book
When's Iron Man gonna show up?
Good night Michael!
Kill men
???
PROFIT
inb4 crash
13if i recall the book only claimed 100mph
hi all
13i doubt you could find enough clearance to get a train to survive 250mph through the rockies
And then they go off the rails and careen into a moose.
how are things FlutterMEDIC
good
Obliterating it instantly and spraying moose-bits all over the place.
how goes?
what's the movie?
FlutterMEDIC: atlas shrugged
okay, you?
dafuq Meanwhile
13dat's a purty bridge
dat bridge
must be one hell of a metal
I just figured it'd be exciting.
13a train that long going 250 mph won't be stopped by much
13(today's meme is now moose, get to it)
What have I started...
EVERYTHING
Shizuka: look, a moose!
TAKE THA, state science!
13moose and squirrel!
Was there ever any doubt.avi
got my first research desk today :) its nothing fancy, but it's a start :) http://i.imgur.com/w7op9.jpg
nice Alchemist
Shizuka: get to it, and stream Rocky and Bullwinkle!
Ah, so Alchemist is becoming an alchemist?
StinkomanFan: gradually :)
Shizuka: sooo this is no a room with a Moose?
Alchemist: looks fancy for a first desk :3
Hope everything goes well, Alchemist :)
*now
13A ROOOOOOOOM
13WITH A MOOOOSE
HEAVY ISH SPY
We need a moose chocolate mousse!
AAAAAAAAAHHHHH
13dumb like a moose dib, dumb like a moose
Shizuka: I love you right now
AJIsAwesome: thanks <3
I'm ok too
13the house they filmed this in is a historical landmark i think? every shot is in broad daylight
13they pull off the effect of night quite well i think
im gonna idle for about a half hour
if that'S broad daylight, then that's some mean ass night effect
Notice how chat quiets down when sex scene occurs.
13trying to remember how long they said they were there, it was a stupidly short amount of time they were allowed to film
CountDoofus: :D
13and yes that sex scene is in the book
13it gets raunchier in part 2
I'd rather chat quiet'ed down than acted like school kids.
I'm proud of you chat.
Dark_Horst: The profit wasn't enough for light effects, they wasted pretty much of it, in the ROOM OF THE MOOSE
Meanwhile: Thanks. :D
I'm not even paying attention to either. Just being here for the sake of being here while working on a new comic.
13i think they rebuilt a couple of the rooms on a soundstage, but at least the dinner table scene was at the actual house in the middle of the day
Meanwhile: well there arent that many of us in here right now, and about 70 people are idlers anyway so... :D
True.
13stuff like that about filmmaking fascinates me
hey
Soup sandwiches
And now, I must leave
Night everypony
GONNA TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE
soup and sandviches are awesome
GONNA TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE
Bye Serenity
yay~ tidus is gone
I'm sure if chat's usual clients were present the reaction would have been much greater.
WOOOO PACKERS
bye Serenity
WOOOOOOOOOOOO
Calm it, mate
This aint football :L
13the *reason* this company failed is very interesting, spelled out in the book
13it's a direct comparison to the soviets as i recall, who were of course an important thing when rand wrote the book
They invested in BLU?
i thought i smelled a hint of communism int hat explanation
CURELOOKINGLIKEHEJUSTGOTOUTOFTHESHOWERSTARINGOFFINTOSPACEWITHASTETHOSCOPEINHISMOUTH hi.
13like the workers threw out the execs and decided they'd do everything collectively
bye Serenity
13which failed spectacularly
bye Serenity
13for everything you guys have ever heard about atlas shrugged, you never expected there to be sci-fi involved did you :3
suddenly science
Shizuka: cant say i did
:|
13this is also in the book
13and as i said earlier there's a superweapon in part 3
SCIENCE
13if you're willing to work past the more anvilicious anti-collectivist points and skip most of galt's speech, AS is quite an interesting book
Shizuka: you mean, they did everything by ways of manufacturing?
Shizuka: i was late on the comment, because of self-doubt
13was more like "we'll keep working, but we're going to collectively decide wages"
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIL
13inevitably some people figured out they could just stop working and yet take home more money than their peers
13so the company imploded
Shizuka: typical communism :D
13eeyup
i i ws right. they DID communism
13james taggart kind of goes insane as the book goes on
13it's funny to watch :3
dat symbol on the cigarette
Hm. That pit stop looks familiar. I think it was in the movie War Games
hello everypony, what we watching?
MADNESS
Dovah: bioshock
THIS IS SPARTA!
Bronysith: missed it. what was it?
13he's one of the people john galt convinced to walk away
13he's sort of the gatekeeper for galt's gulch
Dark_Horst: dollar symbol
bioshock? le gasp wha?!
Dovah: Altlas Shrugged
http://i.imgur.com/K5zph.jpg
*Atlas
Dovah: atlas shrugged. the book this movie comes fromw as also very loose inspiration for bioshock
VERY loose
I see
13and then wyatt walked away
bitches be sabotaging
WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE ALL THE RICH PEOPLE, AND PUSH THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE?
13just about
13he sounds like jeff bridges there
it itches
13part 1 of the book ends on this bad note too, but atlas shrugged follows the first rule of evangelion
13it gets worse
Hey everypony.
It always gets worse.
13come on tell me you can't hear jeff bridges in that voice :3
hi Red_Pegasus
Shizuka: i hear it
Maybe, offhand I don't know who Jeff Bridges is.
i hear lots of communism in that voice
"Digital jazz, man"
What movie is this?
13Meanwhile: kevin flynn in tron, obediah stane in iron man, the dude in big lebowski
atlas shrugged
oh that guy
So... is this when Iron Man shows up?
Or Magneto?
Out of those films I've only seen Iron Man. The bald guy right?
13too late dagny, he's run off with rochelle
Meanwhile: yes
atlantis
Shizuka: Coach is too busy eating his chocolate helicopter.
13that
13is a damn good NOOOOO
aka rapture. only tthis one isnt underwater
Maybe, I haven't seen enough Bridges.
and then he became a splicer
welp, everything is fucked now
That was more like NOOAAAAAAAAA
i can see that ken levine took much inspiration from this book. Atlantis, Rapture
both mythical
What is she so worked up about o__o
SUCKS TO BE YOU
13wyatt's oil field there was the last best hope for her railroad
-Yes, Mister President.
part 1
MadSurge: she practically just watched her company burn
13part 2 is pretty much one gut punch after another for dagny as the country starts to crumble
We watching part 2?
Dark_Horst: welp, time for job hunting!
13part 2 is out in november i think?
13it's this year at least
Oh I see.
13they replaced pretty much the entire cast though
13BUT
13robert picardo is in it
13aka the doctor from voyager
As in Voyager's...
Niiiiice.
13so that'll be fun
who knew a movie about economics could be this interesting
Shizuka: oh, THAT guy! :D
Robert Picardo is awesome.
robert. neato
it seems i missed shizu stream
Interesting? Not for me :|
I dunno why you refer to this as torture Shizu, I quite liked it.
13:3
so, what's next?
13i forget who they said picardo will be playing
You planning on aquiring part 2 when it's out presumably?
13most definitely
Lovely.
So... now what?
Well I'm gonna score a chocolate milkshake while the credits are rolling.
did chat derp on me?
no
Schrödingers chat is in effect.
chat is slow today
/me kidnaps ekips
13appetizer for string quartet
13classical music composers why your titles so silly
Polonaise in a flat Major.

Wasn't this episode based on a contest?
/me hugs FlutterMEDIC, alexxm, cachi01|phone and AJIsAwesome :P

eeyup kidzrul434
What contest?
DEMOMAN IS SPY
13pretty sure that's tom kenny bte
This guy is actually Spongebob's voice isn't he?

13tom kenny is everywhere
i always thought this was a good one
13Athiest: his hook and eyepatch switch sides constantly
i love it when you hit bedrock and find 7 redstone ore before you find diamonds....not really im kidding
I saw the two alternate endings to this episode on the dvd
Troll Kelpo.
cachi01|phone, kids would vote on which endings they'd want for the episode
i hate it!
:O
13there's alternates?
Dynamo2814 ikr
13ohhhhhhh
13that explains why the ending makes no sense
Shizuka: not as good though
The sky had a baby.
FFFFFFFFF-
Shizuka: Both alternte endings have them all eaten
StinkomanFan that explains all

alexxm: the art itself can be fine, it says it also lists art on its concept as well as its execution
still tuesday here though
Hearts n Hooves Day had sneak ona thursday
on a
huh ok
Chrysalis implied that season 3 coming out would bring more traffic, I question whether that traffic would maintain during non-episode days.
Though it's not much of a question, always spikes on episode showings.
Meanwhile: it did for s2
oh, that
i only ever started being regular on here because i watched the ep strea
ep stream
well i should make a mental note to watch what links posted by sith i open
True some people are likely to investigate but considering the most recent influx of people I don't know if that's a good thing.
chrysalis|london: i think thats the second time Major has had his OC in the bad art tumblr
Do what I do
then i believe it was wrek streaming tf2 that really got me hooked
Don't open any of them.
or someone on l4d2
probably a good idea
I remember my first time here. SuperBrony64 was playing a ruubing rabbids game or something like that for DS lol
i mostly stay for the chat and the other shows the stream introduces me to
cachi01|phone: raving rabbits
i stay cause i want to
Nope
Not raving rabbids
It was something about.rubbing
Hearts and Hooves Day was the first chat where I nteracted
This is most of my passtime right here.
interacdted
And very very weird woman sounds everytime he completed a minigame
first time i was here it was some episodes of the last airbender
Meanwhile: I sense a load of kicks and bans in the future
they were streaming house when i first came here
mah first movie here was coraline.and clue :)
same
Spectrum_Rush: Will be a tragic thing.
clue was FAR better than it should of been
^
my first movie was titan ae and revenge of the nerds
chrysalis|london: it was amazing
<3 titan ae
Mine was The Time Traveler's Wife
and now i must go
/me AWAY
<3 ae too
My first movies on here were Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Evil Dead 2.
Later Phase4
so much love for iron giant when it was on
Cant remember the B movie
not quite so on the lag that came with it
I still have to see a movie here on chat
but by god the lag on indian stallone started the greatest meme ever
Which was now...16 months ago.
Great, now I feel old.
Hipster bronies
omg, kill it kill it now
thanks to this stream i've been introduced to game of thrones house and community
or ship it with trixie, either works

Cya Alchemist!
Who is this Major and why should I care?
well, i now know what a neo-ceknyurian is. i feel i was better off when i still ddint. guess it'S one of these days
Major of Ponyville?
[SWAG]Haku: cause he is a 12 year old brat and it is going to be hilarious when he rages
Ok, but who is he?
11,01Hi.
[SWAG]Haku: a 12 year old wannabe marine
Haku a bronystate usual
/me dusts Nittany_Discord.
Hey Nittany_Discord :)
sup Nittany_Discord
hi
oh
/me 11,01dusts Meanwhile
Haio Nittany_Discord
[SWAG]Haku: he played 1 round of CoD and thinks he can be a marine
Hi Nittany_Discord =D
hi Nittany_Discord
Oh Hey Nittany
/me puts Nittany_Discord in an awesome maid corset and pulls on the strings tightly
/me dusts Nittany_Discord's maid uniform
Ohai Nittany_Discord
Nittany_Discord: Irish_Pony(Major)s oc is back where it belongs, in the horrible tumblr
Bronysith just one round? He didnt even finished the search and destroy match? :O
So what are we watching/listening to?
sigh I wish I could remember what was the first movie night i saw
the entirety of life
Haku's first movie night was District 9 and Labrinth
what you are experiencing
Ohi Nittany_Discord
is a sonic recreation of the end of the world
i am done browsing /r/wtf so much weird ass shit in this bitch
prepare to hold your colour?
so i've been watching elfen lied and wow, yeah i can see why it cant be streamed on bronystate
/me hugs Meanwhile he gets it!
Elfen Lied?
Bronysith. Meh /b/ is worse
What is Elfen Lied and why should Haku care?
Why does Haku speak in the third person like an ass?
Elfen Lied is a very very very very very very
cachi01|phone: so you saw the pic of a dudes bone sticking out of his legmeat bleeding badly?
Very very very very
Bloody anime
Meanwhile I do not speak in 3rd person like an ass
So its gory?
Is that all?
Bronysith...... No
How bad could it be.
blood tits and all dem bits
...
Bloody boobs?
Tits? I havent seen any lucy tits
Ok, I can see why thatd be considered bad
cachi01|phone: all /b/ is is lots of nude pics
oh did you get my message?
...
d
Fucking +K set....
11,01I enjoyed Elfen Lied, but it is not for the weak of stomach.
/me not sure if chat died or derpped
derped
Nittany_Discords got it
mods don't want porn on /b/ anymore anyways
11,01Like I said, the very first scene of the anime is a severed arm on the floor.
...
that
is so bucking metal
and then naked chick
Ftw
Ok, Haku is now interested
why are we discussing 4chan?
Are we?
Haku y dafuq are u talking third person?
My first movie night was Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Aguirre: The Wrath of God
I only talk in 3rd person when the moment calls for it
OH YEAH
/me 11,01's first movie night was Se7en and A Pig's Tale.
cachi01|phone: Bronysith wonders why you dont talk in third person
When does the moment ever call for talking like a twonk.
/me YAAAAAAAAWN out of boredom at insurance stuff
Youd be suprised by how often the moment calls for it
and what the hell is a twonk?
Twonk
It sounds like some foreign candy
Twinkies
"Twonk! Now with chocolate coating!"
/me feels like playing PIU again....
HANG ON!..........
Twonk, gimboid, not all there, half-empty, take your pick.
I choose "Take your pick"
I'm sorry that is the incorrect answer.
Is it?
Is it really?
.....
i checked on the page's history, and the REAL Movie night i went through is Buried and History Of The World PART 1
Yeah.
well ive said what i had to say gonna go back to watching elfen lied
Im pretty sure its not
It is.
13os iusti meditabitum~
Holy Grail and Wrath of God was the 2nd
Dark92Enigma.i remember those lol
13sapientiam~
13oh sorry
Haku says it is not, and Haku is never worng!
wrong*
0,14Shizuka speaking in tongues?
whatever
13THE NAME'S HAKU
Haku doo
YES I AM NOW AN EXPLORING PEGASUS
13where are you~
buffer.
Pegasususususus
Haku is that dude who looks like a chick from Naruto.
ALL OF YOU CAN SUCK IT
SAd for YOUUUUUUUUUUU
I'm good
whut?
Time to hit the hay. 'Night, everypony.
13you mean all of them meanwhile?
Meanwhile You have discovered the origins of my name, which I took onto myself several years ago
No, Haku is the spirit of the river!
Goodnight CountDoofus
she gobbles you up
Night CountDoofus
Good point actually Shizu.
night
night CountDoofus
With maybe the exception of huge eyebrow guy.
Rock Lee?
Guy?
goodnight CountDoofus
naruto is a DBZ rip off...not so much as bleach though
Both Lee and guy had catapillar eyes
Bronysith not sure if trolling....
How is Naruto, a show about ninjsa, a rip off of DBZ, a show about alien marital artists?
what? Bleach IS DBZ WITH SWORDS
Trolololololol
IT IS
yeah he is trolling lol
It is if DBZ went more into depth with the dead
Naruto didn't have any MYSTICAL OBJECT to collect
[SWAG]Haku: and swords
like the DRAGONBALLS
Naruto has tailed beasts though.
Haku uhmmmm well....... They all die like 2018392 times...
Bleach is a show which is all about death and souls. DBZ is a show about alien marital artists
Meanwhile: 9 of em
And no one has ever died in Bleach AND came back later, unless they came back as a monster
I imagine saying Bleach is DBZ with swords is a comparison you only make if you've only ever seen the fight scenes.
Granted, most of the cast ARE technically dead
^
>marital artists... wat
Hey guys how.many saiyans do you need to change a light bulb?
3
Just 1 but it takes 3 episodes and krillin dies in the process
One to change the bulb
BA DUM TSS
and 2 to have throw poo at each other
because theyre monkeys
how do you defeat a Nordic god?
Take away his hammer
Nords from skyrim i mean
so that he becomes human
Bronysith call kratos?
Kratos was greek
Anyway
heres what you do, shoot the nordic god once in the knee
And let me stop you right there.
he will give up on life. and become a guard
I used to make arrow to the knee jokes
But then i took an arrow to the knee
http://i.imgur.com/GSloF.jpg
[SWAG]Haku: doesnt matter, they will still give up and become a guard
That doesnt seem very fun
Meanwhile oh god
Ohi Wrek
But it DOES mean them not dying
and suddenly Wrek how you doing?
Dat Wrek
invulnerability.
[SWAG]Haku: technically, there are no 'Nordic' gods they worship the same gods that are worshiped in every single part of tamriel (elder scrolls world)

Ponies47: Yes, do take a lot of pictures. :P Cause I can't go to Equestria LA due to lack of $60. So I'll live a con through your photos.
Ponies47: Oh. :$
*2 4 GB
well sorry shizuka i didn't mean to miss spell
Probably because they don't tab names Shizu. Which you don't either. :P
Klumzeedragon: Mah pass was $40 freaking dollars ;_;
Ponies47 plsss take loooooots of photos. Btw what are.you going to ask to tara?
hello lonepony :P
I'm just poor and unemployed.
Moopy, you can just use the autocomplete method, then you won't have to worry about spelling someone's name right.
Moopy: You can just start someones name and press tab and it will spell the rest out for you. :D
how can i do that dude?
Been working with my local Voc Rehab office to fix that.
cachi01|phone: Most likely I'll ask her to quote somthing Twilight said I was think "CLOCK IS TICKING!"
Moopy: With TAB.
Moopy, what Klumzeedragon said :P
Hi moobull69 :)
Maybe get a job and save for Bronycon 2013.
One can hope.

13:3
I'd rather go to Nittany con.
So all i have to do is hit tab?
O u.
Moopy, begin with someone
But I'm all set for Canterlot Gardens and can't wait for Friday!
Ponies47 cool :) i dont know why but i wanted tara to dance gangnam style :I lol
cachi01|phone: Aye. There will be a 5th character in October. :) She's called a Mechromancer.
Ponies47: Have a GREAT time. :)
Oh hang on a minute let me try something here
Moopy, begin with someone's name (eg Ada) then press tab (eg AdamTheDuck)
There wouldn't be much at a Nittanycon.
I would go. :(
maids
Maids everywhere
I'd still go anyway
BarbetosSMASH: whatchu playing? >.>
To see all the maids :D
everyone knows me but I don't know them XD
13a nittany con would resemble a michael bay con
Maids, explosions, nittany pluhies
Even though I'm not tht into the whole maid thing. myself.
Lol.
Ponies47: Yikes. $40, is still better than $60. And from what I've heard, Canterlot Gardens is gonna be huge in comparison.
Let's see Pony shirt's, check. Camera, Check, Extra batteries for camera, Check. Memory cards for camera, check. Pass for the con, Check, Hotel, check :3
Like this
Trying to get away from maids.
Ponies47 u r missing one important thing....
I still need to get ready for PonyRenFest. :O
Klumzeedragon: So many cast members coming. SO EXCITED! ^-^
cachi01|phone: Oh? O.O
(eg Ada) Klumzeedragon
Ponies47 toilet paper.
wait i hit the wronge button
cachi01|phone: Toilet paper?
YES
Moopy, type in "ada" then press tab (without quotation marks)
oh ok sorry
cachi01|phone: Why toilet paper?
Imagine yourself sittin.in the toilet. And then BANG you realize theres no toilet paper
like this
A NDcon may or may not have maids. It would have explosions and a mandatory storm chase.
Moopy: :D You got the right idea. But you dont need the (eg Ada) that was suppose to be an example. :)
13and van halen
And you have to laugh at creepypasta or get kicked out.
Nittany_Discord: dayum, thats hardcore
I laugh at creepypastas.:)
ada Klumzeedragon
HAHAHAH SAM HAHAHA CUPCAKES HAHAHAHA MY LITTLE DASHIE
did that work?
http://derpy.me/56qFV
13you'll have to forgive the lower quality of the revelation OST
Moopy: Like this. If I type Moo and then press tab right after, it'll spell the rest of your name for me.
13was hard to find in any quality at all
Well no Bstate mods will be there. But atleast one other person from bronystate is coming and that's Quick_Thinker atleast there is one other person from this chat going to Canterlot Gardens
AdamTheDuck oh god
Whoa
13vis likes this one
i think my tab button doesn't work for me dude
wats goign un gsy?
nittanycon is a hit
BarbetosSMASH, we're all preparing to go to Nittanycon
/me Would go to Nittanycon
Moopy: You dont need the ada or anything. He was saying if you put ada and pressed tab, it would find AdamTheDuck's name. No spaces or anything.
13shizu con would be impossible to find, and when you get there there wouldn'tbe anything
Moopy, eeyup, what Klumzeedragon said.
To the Mojave!!
bonjour
Shizuka: Not even a cardboard cutout of the Pyro? D:
Watch out for sumi and bombs though.
Hi, RAWRity
I know where Shizucon would be.
Ohai RAWRity
"Patrolling the Mojave almosts makes you wish for a nuclear winter"
13not even a cardboard cutout of cardboard
hi RAWRity
Hello RAWRity
13it's that hidden
And when I find it, I'll give Shizuka a big old hug.
Take me to private chat im really confused hard here
Shizuka: I see
00,10my what?
Hmmm..
Shizucon. Fire, gas masks, shizu plushies
/me puts Sumica in a box
13vis really likes this one
Ohai Mica
Something tells me to get INTO Shizu con, assuming you found the right place, you would be presented with a single object. You would have the rub the said object on anything and everything to try and figure out how to progress further.
Ponies47: Yeah. I saw that. So jealous. :D I mainly wanted to go to Equestria LA to see HotDiggedyDemon and EgoRaptor and maybe meet some fellow bronies. :D I only know one other brony in person. They seem to be scarce here.
Klumzeedragon: Funfact: HotDiggedyDemon is coming to Canterlot Gardens :$
13i might try to dig out my revelation cds some time later
13see if scrcap will play along
Anyone got a strange weap on TF2 they'd trade for a Strange Rocket Launcher?
13revelation is stupid hard in places though
Ponies47: I know. I saw his travel schedule. :P Get him to sign something for me. :D
Well. Need to restart. BRB
Meanwhile: Allow me to check my inventory
Meanwhile: What did you have in mind?
Ponies47 oh.pls tell him that i say that he is fucking awesome
G'night everypony! :)
And yush! I got my Rainmeter ponies to work. :D
And also tell that to andrew wk if you talk to him
Night GilDash|Dinner
Preferably something scout, heavy or engi Ponies47 but I'd settle for any ranged strange I don't already have.
Goodnight GilDash|Dinner

Freefall29: Earthboud. That's why.
russians vs chuck norris...who would win XD
Mr ame and watch.
Bronysith: I see you've played it
Chuck norris
shuddup: what kind of a question is that.
Freefall29: i dont need to to know that it is the darkest and saddest game in nintendo history
Bronysith: I find mother 1 darker, but mother 3 is still dark, its the sadder one of the three
Oh and Zero Suit Samus.
my frend texted me that
Freefall29: and then earthbound is just hilarious?
Crystaline_Shard you mean fan service samus?
Bronysith: earthbound is still at times a dark game, but it tries to cover it with its more parody gameplay
you know what show is really weird? Breaking Amish
shuddup: tell him Chuck is already headed his way to teach him a lesson
I mean the only one that doesin't spam mega ultra charge move for instant win.
okay
RAWRity: what about that one show where they keep innocent youngins in cages and force them to perform for their entertainment?
DA MUSIC IS AWESOME
WAEAEAEAEAAEAE
Bronysith: nah, that's just Barney
Bronysith: you mean charlie and the chocolate factory?
I used to like sonic in brawl, but he sucks to me now

Toddlers and Tiaras shouldn't even have xisted.
Bronysith: I avoid that show on principle alone
what do you guys think is better... L4D2 or Cod Mw3
shuddup: Pokemon
L4D2
shuddup: shupt up with the rehtorical question
Everyone on that show should be shot.

I find that man who punched snooki in the face a hero
Bronysith: so everyone should hate canada cuz of bieber?
mfw I mention Kusanagi, and everyone says, "I LOVE GITS"
Plus that would be a better show then that :/
I LOVE GITS
Everyone should hate the UK because of Jedward
twilight_sprinkle: no everyone should hate canada because salene.
Because I'm gonna say it: Bieber>Jedward
shuddup, take a note from your name :)

Crystaline_Shard: *Celine

W/e
twilight_sprinkle: look them up.
Who dafuq is jedward

Filmbrain dancing: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_macl22kCQf1rpn610o1_250.gif
Desert eagle is not a name of a bird. unless you mean eagle in the desert and I find that unlikly.
oh sry lowfn

0,14ooh this song sounds epic
shuddup: shoot someone with a desert eagle, its going to go through, that person, and everything else behind him, not very good and it is just so impractical
Who's Filmbrain?
Heh Filmbrain.
/me wants to watch anime but doesn't want to leave the epic music.

Gah! so much epic music... can.. not... leave...
I think the punishment should fit the crime, so a serial killer's final meal on death row should be cereal. Cheerios.	
I wouldin't define musicplayer random shape thingy as a video.
Bronysith: why cheerios
Crystaline_Shard: well a video is playing a song isn't it

A child lost his mother thx to stupid aliens
Thats enough to make me tear a bit
ohai

Slen: Just listenin' to music
oh ok
that one scene at the camp fire alone makes mother 3 a pretty dark game
cachi01|phone: No. A child lost his mother to a stupid fat idiotic boy who's afraid of death.
Hello FillyFlam
you gotta play earthbound before playing mother 3.
you simply gotta
lol https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/14/2tzEuBzR1kKIOjDRHIVd5Q2.gif
Brb downloading le roms
Fun Fact: In the coding of Mother 3 you can find an animation of Porky's tube breaking and him dieing. They originally wanted him to die, but they figured that his fate is Mother 3 was better instead.
AJIsAwesome: yeah. porky is a pretty tragic villian. its truly not his fault he is what he is
Freefall29: True, but you have to remember he was a dick to Ness from the very beginning.
"Kamishima Overlay mix"...so is this something you whipped up Shizuka?
Probably because of his parents.
13it's the track from the OST plus the extra mixes found in uru live
AJIsAwesome: he was a dick from giygas corruption. Giygas manipulates and influences your mind with evil.
Chat crashed on me
Freefall29: True.
Ponies47: Did you check PixelKitties post?
AJIsAwesome: then again... with his parents... his mind was evil to begin with.
Yep
Date hot asian women? Lol what an add...I am half asian
i'm currently in the process of playing mother 1 again.
love that game
but it is sad
Hey i checked out borderlands 2 on bing and i was like wow really.......boarder lands 2 is really boring
this time I'm not gonna cheat... but then again, how could you blame me
like this
why would you cheat Freefall29 ? sheesh
Bronysith: the respawn rate in mother is evil... pure evil. not to mention, most of the enemies have 1 hit kill attacks
Bronysith: the creator actually gave an apology for the final portion of the game
which game?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: mother... aka earthbound zero
ah

Bronysith: well the HAHAHA that's funny was sarcasm, and the wrench part was trying to imitate how you find my humor with something you normally do
/me beats Freefall29 to death more
my god this is funny
hey does the paintchat ever work at all i mean jeeze man
Not at the moment, I think.
Bronysith: you're really beating a dead horse here bro
/me laughs madly while drinking blood from Freefall29 s skull
13you have any idea how much work goes into the paintchat moopy?
13didn't think so
Moopy yes it works. But nopony uses it
Well that sucks

/me puts Moopy in a cement mixer

Bronysith: I loved that show
Bronysith: it was an awesome show
Well can i use a rocket to blow it up?
it was interesting, not my fav show
Moopy: nope, cause ill just eat it
Ed Edd n' Eddy is my favorite out of the Cartoon Cartoons. Next to Courage <3
/me puts Freefall29 in a blender with Ponies47
Bronysith: well, it did appear at the end of the 90s, aka the good years
fine go for it
The animation hurt my eyes. That constant moving lines @_@
the 90s werent the good years
0,14ooh, where is this from?
13late 90s
Mah fave show was The grim adventures of.billy and mandy
cachi01|phone: fuck yes
^^
13phoenix rock station played it a lot, loved it so much
I'm interested to see how far they go with this
cachi01|phone: grim and mandy was awesome... so dark but funny at the same time
Billy and mandy*
Lol
131998 according to the tags
i liked chowder, dont know why
Heh mine was to i like mandy
Billy and mandy wasnt dark imo
i need to get back into animaniacs
Bronysith same here
-_(\ I was wondering where everything went - Im using the wrong program - brb
0,14ah
Chowder was funny
Bronysith: Agreed. DOn't know what I liked about it, but it appealed to me for some reason.
well i like the way mandy talks in her way you know
Maybe is the animation. I don't know.
animaniacs was pretty cool. I didn't watch it much
Well, all I know is that the early seasons f CHowder were good. The later seasons sucked.
the dirtiest joke in animaniacs was "I FOUND PRINCE" and the girl was holding prince the musician "no, we need FingerPrints" she looks at prince "Yea thats not happening" :D
animaniacs iirc.was.about furries saving the world. Right?
I still remember that one. :D
Courage The Cowardly Dog :3
Bronysith: Oh God that! XD
Bronysith: give me the bird! we love to really... but the fox censors woulden't allow it
So let guess have i been really mean to you guys like years like a little bit?
Freefall29: not as bad as teh one i just said "fingerprints" finger prince
so fucking wrong
Netgear opened Internet Explorer in place of Firefox - I thought all my things were deleted
Strike 1 for Netgear
Looney Tunes is boss :3
what would happen if i gave Shizuka a raspberry muffin?
I love using internet explorer..........to download other browsers
BUURRRN
13i would have a raspberry muffin
Bronysith: well what about "yakko, can you conjugate. me? i've never kissed a girl... no no, its easy, I'll conjugate with you, good night everybody. let me conjugate at the board, don't look" three dirty ones in a time span of 5 seconds
Freefall29: Finger
^ :D
prince
as in
Bronysith: I got the joke dude
put your finger in princes, yea you get the idea
Bronysith: dude. I got it the joke
Guess what I finally found at 3 am this moring :)
lol skyrim gangnam style
What?
Your clock Cypresswolf?
Bronysith: That's sick but funny as (squee) XD
Cypresswolf: porn?
Cypresswolf obama porn?
Bronysith: ugh... just because I didn't find it the dirtiest one doesn't mean I didn't get it
0,14and now the amount of Faith no More songs I've listened to goes up to 2

Freefall29: name 5 songs by led zeppelin right now
13for a while i woke up to hey man nice shot cause it has such a long build up
"I am Ludwig Van Bethoven, world famous composer and pianist!" "You're a what?" "A PIANIST!" "Good night, everybody!" :D
I woke up 3 hours before my alarm went off, so I went to buy pet food and they were the last ones in the pony isle
Bronysith: why?
0,14I used to set the radio for my alarm, and I had the the station set to the local rock station
13don't think i have that down in the archives anymore though
not sure why Im not tire right now
I HATE my alarm clock the beeping is so annyoing -_-
Freefall29: because you said you liked led zeppelin and you probably dont know that many songs by them
*tired - apparently tired enough to screw up my typing
Bronysith: so by your logic I gotta know all their songs to like them....
13next time i think i will run S&M
0,14so I woke up to amazing music, which would lead into my interest in S-
13already coming up on 5 and a half hours here so not tonight
Freefall29: you cant say you like a band if you only like 1 song, and they have a shitton more than 5 songs
0,14<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
Freefall29 he said 5..
0,14S&M <3
"oh hey, i like enter sandman, i must be a hardcore metallica nut"

Metallica <3
Yes i love Metallica dudes
Moopy: fav album?

I need to do more midnight pony raids :) The walmart near me is deserted at night - perks for being in the countryside
cachi01|phone: "in loud whisper" hes a noob
Wish I could say the same about Speck's
my fav album is a tie between ride the lighting and master of puppets of course <3
cachi01|phone: all I ment was that I... just nvm. nvm before this gets twisted even further

13i just kept them around because in the end and numb
0,14There are better songs >.>
but yea, he/she gets it, no need to hammer it down to him/her anymore
Shizuka: Linkin park? Play dat (squee)! :D
^^
Well to be honest linkin park started.being.shitty when they released a thousand.suns...
That album sucked
13i only have hybrid theory and meteora sitting here
cachi01|phone, yeah...
0,14well, i meant from those two albums
13faint is okay
Hey guys Im home from school
0,14Points of Authority, Forgotten and um...
Shizuka breaking the habit
13i also have most of NIN here
hai ASoftFluffyThing
Papercut
0,14I forget what else, but those were super godlike
hi ASoftFluffyThing
A place for my head
/me hugs Dken2021, AJIsAwesome
/me huggles ASoftFluffyThing back :3
One step closer
god, there was this one ponce in my senior class who was obsessed with NiN, he friggin carved the bands name into his arm
YEEEESH THX
with a pencil?
Dken2021: try a knife
ah, the end and numb are actually my favorite linkin park songs too
13ooo
13this would make for good audiosurf
13if only scrcap didn't suck at hooking onto audiosurf now
0,14I should really bust out my burnt copies of HT and Meteora
A place for my heaaad
i havent heard "for whom the bell tolls" in forever, such a great song
13sudden shinji monologue
You try to tske the best of me...
GO AWAAAY!
Shizuka: evangelion?
13mustn't run away mustn't run away
ahh yea
i am going to have to watch NGE again,

0,14I really love Mike Shinoda's rapping
0,14dude has good flow
Uh....
0,14right into Head Like a Hole
13i lost count of how many Doom WADs used this
13just sounds like it should be a MIDI track doesn't it
0,14was expecting Forgotten because that's the cd's transition, but this worked suprisingly well
nine inch nails did the kick ass soundtrack for quake 1
13reznor is big in sound design
it sucks that you only get the music if the CD is inserted.
/me 11,01rocks
13did a lot for doom 3 as well
/me rolls Nittany_Discord
11,01Shizuka loves a lot of the music I do.
13i almost never listen to full albums unless it's ambient stuff
0,14I swear I have a love/hate relationship with NIN, there's a few songs (like this one) that I really enjoy and then others that are like NOOO MAKE IT STOP
13need variety in my leads :3
o3o
11,01Like Tool Shizuka?
i need more meat in my diet, even though my diet is entirerly bacon
13Right Where It Belongs off the With Teeth album is very good
13not sure if i ever heard much tool
shcism?
11,01Might have.
13most of my rock exposure is from 1998-2000 from the rock station in phoenix
13i recall mudshovel
All da color
11,01Tool was around then.
0,14Out of With Teeth, I really enjoyed The Hand That Feeds and Only
13this and Last are on my favs list cause of doom wads
The Hand that feeds is a pretty cool song
me too
Shizuka: which wad levels did NIN inspire?
13at one point i queued the NIN discography into winamp, i think i got up to the fragile before doing something else
0,14there was one PMV that used this song
13this one was in a wad of deathmatch houses
0,14did a super good job, but I also felt a little crazy watching it ^_^
13very nice detail for early 90s doom wads
Hey Everypony! :)
Hi, DerpDash :)
Hi DerpDash

13likely not
Ohai DerpDash
13my library's not that great

Sketch_Toku_Brony, YES
13in 1996 they did a CD of their best
11,01Got into wrestling. Got out of it after it became predictable.
Mlpojima productions
SaxyPretender: I've only watched wrestling twice when they have goofy guests gimmicks, like when they brought in Bob Barker and the Muppets
Nittany_Discord: I heard WWE 13 has it's Attitude Era mode,
0,14some of the guests were pretty good to my understanding, but yeah, WWE tends to go through good and bad periods of writing
11,01I remember when the WWE was the WWF.
SaxyPretender: oppinion The Undertaker
SaxyPretender: like the ending to Money In The Bank 2011 involving CM PUNK
11,01And there was the WCW.
MAN THAT WAS EPIC

Reikim: Tell from Phase4 (2012-09-25 23:25:38 EST): that should give you a hypebola with one solution

You need mor emusic.
11,01Dark92Enigma: I guess. That's when I watched it.

I stopped watching wrestling in the mid-90s when it started getting crude. I liked the 80s wrestling when Hulk Hogan was around
Nittany_Discord: alas, i have the wrestling figures collection, to relive that era
0,14ahha

Nittany_Discord: i have Hulk Hogan, Shawn Michaels, UNDERTAKER, HHH, Big Show

JESmith71: NEVER COUNT OUT THE MACHO MAN....OOOOOOOOOH YEEEEEEAH
Nittany_Discord: WCW: Mayhem ?

So what's the Line Dance?

13tangent story
Carmina Burana
13in my high school choir, we once did a song which was a medley of various music eras
13set to the tune of mary had a little lamb
OH FORTUNA
But Saxy, you said "Carmen Burnina". That is so many shades of bad.
so just played the RE6 demo a few days ago annnnnd i kinda prefer 4 even 5 over 6 :S some of the control are a teeny tiny bit awkward though Leon's campaign was what SHOULD be for RE6's atmosphere
13so picture if you can the tune of mary had a little lamb
13to o fortuna
ready
How does that even
hello

0,14-P
0,14* =P
...That's a lot of FF7 Piano
13but first
SAXY!
0,14oh hai Pinkies4thWall
Saxy is now a cyclops.
0,14Am not!
There's some rocks there
just sent in my movie picks
05,15CyclopsPretender
13fallen is the only album of these guys i have
Saxy, Rainbow squadron will now have an iron on patch for all 8 members
BUFFERING!
OH GAWD EVANESCENCE
A: Battle Royale, B: Nudist Colony of the Dead
Evanescence fuck yeah
05,15Oh god....my half brother was obsessed with these people
AJIsAwesome
0,14sweet, Pinkies4thWall
Oh, okay, you don't want to be a badass mythological monster. That's okay, Saxy. You can stay being your regular, non-badass self.
RAWRity: /) on that A.
0,14Cyclopses are easily fooled
Naked Zombies?
Reikim|DED: (\
So that explains why Saxy is a cyclops then.
0,14Hey!
lets continue tomorrow bai
Stallion_of_War, tap that
:P
Stallion_of_War: zombies with strategically placed leaves
0,14also, Evanescence? I'm okay with dat
Man, though. Battle Royale. I should have dropped that in as my A.
meh, Evanscense was ruined by me thanks to the Goth kids in my high school blasting that shit all the time.
Teach these Hunger Games kids what it really means to make a bunch of high school kids fight each other to the death.
I SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN HUNGER GAMES AS MY A
/me facehoof
Hunger Games is too recent.
Stallion_of_War: too recent
So don't worry.
05,15I was at a Sears store once, and and Evanescence video was playing, except Sears had it labled as Evan's Escence
05,15I lol'd
0,14XD
:(
13olol
lol
That was a troll. There was no way it wasn't.
Escence of Evan. Hm.
13also ja stallion, playing hunger games would just paint a big target on us
Wait
This CD... it smells a lot like Evan
Reikim but its already release on dvd
Battle Royale, on the other hand, is 12 years old, but recently got a US release on DCD
Meanwhile what are you thinking and should I really be asking
*DVD
this song....
dat ff7ac
05,15If it came out within the past year, it's too recent
/me kicks ass for the duration of this track
cachi01|phone: too close for comfort for the mods.
Reikim|DED: Not much, I'm surprisingly tired tbh.
cachi01|phone: same reason Hugo was rejected.
Hugo?
0,14>saw title
0,14>saw fighting
Oh
Aww... May I ask why recent release dates matter?
The inventiom of.hugo
0,14>thought it was from a fighting game
Because if they didn't... I'd really want to watch The Avengers as well...
05,15Stallion_of_War legal issues. The more recent a film, the more risky it is to show it.
Sounds like if it was from skullgirls
It's not, Saxy...but it would be a PRETTY BADASS FG track.
0,14indeed
Stallion_of_War: often you can't find a torrent of them, or the torrents are beign watched and puts the streamer at risk of being hit by the DMCA in the nuts.
Actually
05,15dem C&D letters
This remix was in Dissidia!
So in a way, Saxy, it kind of is!
/me uses this as his theme for kicking ass as Tifa
I blame sxyprtndr.
0,14I do too-
hello every pony i hope it as good a day for yous as it is for me
0,14hey wait
Reikim really? Duodecim or first dissidia?
I suppose Iron Mane is basically like, 2/5 of The Avengers movie anyhow...
hi therainbowvortex
cachi01|phone: Track was in both.
/me pokes chat
Hi therainbowvortex :)
NeverEnding Story and Star Trek First Contact are both As right?
13yes and yes
13i used this for battle music in morrowind, usually didn't get more than thirty seconds in
Gotta be honest, I don't see why everyone says Avengers was so great. I found myself bored during a good deal of that movie, just waiting for them to get to the big fight scene already.
Haven't seen Avengers yet.
Not really missing much.
If you close your eyes during all the non-action parts that don't involve Tony Stark, you won't be missing much.
Just theoretically, wouldn't it be less of an issue to stream a copy of a digital copy of a movie from like, Amazon that someone here owns?
05,15I will admit the first half of that movie was underwhelming but the second half more than made up for it.
^
0,14Hulk not so much, Cap yes
0,14and probably Thor
Inb4 shitstorm
/me Smiles
05,15I really liked it. Thor was also great.
11,01Just a warning before I leave: Posting jump scares is grounds for a kick or ban for trolling. So don't do it again Tiberium126. Only warning.
i have never seen iron man 2
Thor was missing his helmet
0,14I enjoyed Avengers all the way through
Nittany_Discord, oh
13the OCRemix album for FF7 is pretty awesome
"Jump scares?" What?
Also, I really liked Black Widow. Half of me says she was an underdeveloped character. The other half i.e. the male half says she was very nicely developed thank you very much.
Avengers IMO was the best movie I've ever watched
Is that
Nittany_Discord a bit too late dont u think?
That's Cosmo Canyon from Voices of the Lifestream
*Action movie
YEEEEEAAAAAH
0,14only OC remix song I have is an awesome one of Ken's SF2 theme
13that bass
Nittany_Discord, do you know about that creppy korean comic?
Another confession: I found Tony Stark to be kind of insufferable during most of The Avengers
0,14also, Reikim|DED HEYOOOO
13so much thump
11,01Not really. Was discussing it with staff cachi01|phone.
13while we're on an OCRemix kick
11,01And better late than never.
Avengers 0/1000 no garfield in it dont bother watching.it
g2g
0,14also also, dat feel when SSF2THDR came out and it was done by OCRemix
God this is such a badass remix. Especially when you consider how laid-back the original was.
In the Iron Man films, he's pretty spot-on with the one-liners and all, but something about the writing in Avengers was just too telegraphed for me.
Meh...So how's everyone tonight?
Nittany_Discord oh :)
RAWRity: Well, probably a change in direction. It was...what's his name that did Avengers. The Buffy guy. I think someone else did the Iron Man movies.
Like, I can't find a joke funny when I see a character spend an entire paragraph setting it up just to make Tony sound clever.
Getting angry at the feaudalism3 delays. what about you.
cachi01|phone: really?....................oh, ok :)
0,14Jon Favreau did Iron man
Reikim|DED: Joss Whedon
Whedon.
0,14fun factL Favreau graduated from my high school
Which is funny because Whedon is usually pretty good about this kind of thing.
See: Firefly.
I was avoiding mentioning Whedon because I kind of hate Whedon's writing 90 percent of the time.
05,15You know what movie I actually liked that people hated? Cowboys and Aliens.
05,15that was a Favreau film if I recall
0,14yep
Fluttercry: that movie was fun, But I wish they'd been a bit tighter on the pacing.
Cowboys and aliens sounds just as stupid as abraham lincoln vampire hunter........
And this is when I'd possibly be watching The copy of The Avengers that I bought off of Amazon IF IT CAME TODAY!
Goddamit Winamp, why won't you apply my skin?
cachi01|phone: and both were awesome action movies.
cachi01|phone: Hobo with a shotgun.
0,14>implying Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter was stupid
Well let's be honest
0,14I got a penny from that guy!
The name
That's a bloody stupid premise.
05,15Last movie I saw was the newest Resident Evil movie, and I wanted to burn that theatre by the time that was over
/me hasn't seen movies in question and thus reserves judgement
SaxyPretender: Abraham Lincoln Zombie hunter exists too :D
Abraham Linken; Vampire hunner.
05,15Unquestionably the worst movie I have ever seen
how was Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Hunter? I have the book
I laughed when I heard that title for the movie. :D
05,15Worse than Babes in Toyland
Meanwhile: it's MEANT to be stupid. It's purposefully ridiculous, and they use that premise to make an awesome action flick.
ASoftFluffyThing: Movie>Book
Fluttercry: I thought there was one before that, and it was worse. Was it...four?
Fluttercry its a RE movie what did you expected?
You saw Crystal Skull in theatres Shizu? I'm so sorry.
RAWRity: Wait, so the movie is actually good?
RAWRity: Ah
13no
/me also enjoyed Crystal Skull?
13then baby sister happened
/me didn't hate Crystal Skull
0,14^
^^
0,14ah
Need a duke nukem movie just for lulz./
AJIsAwesome|Busy: it's great. The book is basically a Biography of Lincoln with the occasional mention of vampires.
Whaddya mean you didn't hate Crystal Skull.
Have you even seen an Indy film before?
0,14I actually liked it
The crystal skull was my first indiana jones.movie :I
Most movies these days are bad
^^
13as an indy movie it was terrible, but it's an alright popcorn flick on its own
Also, my issue with the RE movies IN GENERAL is that they eliminate a lot of the atmosphere that the games had. I haven't played/seen them, but when you go from survival horror to superpowered chick in latex...well, something's been lost.
13i'd rank it above temple of doom anyway >>
0,14same
05,15as the Nostalgia Critic said, Temple of Doom had even dumber stuff in it. What Shizuka said. Sometimes I just want to watch stuff happen
HEY crystal skull had the most memorable WTF scene.
13that too
Nuking the fridge :/
/me has never seen any of the Indiana Jones movies
13how can you not love the absurdity of surviving a point blank nuke with a fridge
No one survives nukes by hiding in a fridge.
Also, six movies is too much for a franchise. ANY franchise. END IT ALREADY.
/me punches her Winamp
Indiana Jones and the movie that no one ever watches?
that's why it's awesome :D
Reikim star wars
Reikim|DED, would you say the same for Harry Potter?
05,15Reikim|DED What about Star....oh wait
0,14I'm going to assume all the various deities cut Jones some slack for that one
05,15Yeah, Indy lives in a universe where EVERY god is real. So he can survive a nuke
Reikim harry potter was awesome and it had 7 books
Harry Potter had 7 books and 8 movies
You don't understand though guys. They used to make refrigerators out of Nokias
13god's like "you know, i should kill him for being dumb enough to hit a nuke, but then he did save my grail and my ark.... well okay just this once"
ASoftFluffyThing: Exception. They were working off an established timeline.
Reikim|DED, what about Star Trek?
7 books. 8 movies. you can't explain thta.
that*
Kandarihu: How many of those were good?
Reikim|DED: True.
i can explain it!
05,15I can explain it with one symbol
Meanwhile: Magic *snort snort*
05,15$
13isn't star trek's rule that every other movie sucks? or every third or something
Technically it's English to it'd be £
Reikim|DED, quite a few of them.
Kandarihu: Also there's a show in between movies for Star Trek. So they more or less stand alone /as movies/.
Just divide the last by 2 and thats it.
05,15Every Odd numbered Star Trek is bad
Well Star Wars also has books for the EU but I've never read any of them so...
05,15The even ones are good
So, who here's heard what they're calling the next Star Trek film?
0,14KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANfound it
Reikim|DED: Every even numbered trek movie was good if i recall the myth
"Star Trek Into Darkness"
...
no, I'm not missing a colon there
Please say you're lying.
:D
05,15I think it was 4 that involved time travel and SPACE WHALES
RAWRity dafuq
1st movie with VGER was ok,
To boldy go where no one has shone a light before...
KAHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN was good
I agree Fluttercry
13well double dumbass on you!
0,14Tron Legacy music?
0,14YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
13(only scene i know from original series movies)
Search for spock was good
worst name I've heard since A Good Day To Die Hard
^
0_o theres LORE to TF2?!
Yes
Reikim|DED: It's true. or was it every second movie :/
and so was Journey Home
05,15Sketch_Toku_Brony yup
5 of the One Piece Movies were good.
No really RAWRity please say you're pulling my leg.
:I
KAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
Reikim|DED: eenope
...
2, 4, 5, 6, and 10
I'm going to
Sketch_Toku_Brony just see the lore vid
Go write something?
Nittany_Discord, my apologies just had another read through the rules and must of missed that rule the first time.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: It explains it in the comics, I think.
Anything to forget that for now.
Alos the lore video.
05,15Why does this sound like Deus Ex
7 was alright, too.
but if they call the 6th Die Hard movie "Old Habits Die Hard" all will be forgiven.
11,01K. Glad you read the rules.
0,14because Daft Punk, Fluttercry
And this is where I'd put my copy of The Avengers IF I HAD ONE
cachi01|phone: i just did lol i always though it was "RED,BLUE...FIGHT MAGGOTS" :D
05,15I know, I just never made that connection before. But it totally sounds like that
http://cdn.memegenerator.net/images/300x/5578629.jpg
05,15I never asked for this
Sketch_Toku_Brony xd

Do you have any cool spyro stuff finds today? :)
13Meanwhile: well, *a* flynn lives
*points to bed*And this is where I'd put my girlfriend. IF I HAD ONE
13not *the* flynn
Oh, what about the 007 movies?
Shizuka I have no idea who Flynn is or what he's from I just wanted to disagree with Saxy.
*points at chat* and this is where I'd put my fucks...IF I HAD ANY
05,15Kandarihu those are special
Kandarihu: the new ones kinda suck :?
Final Destiation anything over 1: Because we didn't get there last time
Hard.
Kandarihu: too many for my tastes, though I hope Skyfall will be good.
0,14I need to see Skyfall because Javier Bardem.
13casino royale is the only bond i've seen
05,15Sean Connery is the best Bond though
Dat co-op ending theme
0,14also, i liked Casino Royale
nah nothing really
Shizuka: Pierce go watch him be bond.
Pierce Brosnan is going to nut you.
0,14and what I've seen of Quantum of Solice
Meanwhile: not sure if typo
there's a big spyro plushie, the second biggest one i know of
Once he's finished fighting fat people with killer hats and giant men with metal teeth.
05,15The only thing I remember from Casino Royale was Bond was brutal and there was parkour
Quantum of Solace...I don't remember much of that, to be honest.
Fluttercry same here
13so since i'm sure none of you get the pun in the artist tag here
it's probably one you're wanting. it's 80 bucks though
Also, I believe Casino Royale was basically Bourne only in Bond form.
Pierce Brosan in best Bond :$
They turned bond into a muscle bound action start I can't forgive them for that.
0,14one of my favorite parts of Casino Royale was Vesper and Bond just breaking each other down
Well we need to see it, Shizu.
13mixed with Robots FTW here is Going to Another Place by Mannheim Steamroller
0,14ha
13thus Aperture Science Vapor Pressurization
Has no one here watched Goldfinger or The Man With the Golden Gun or Octopussy?
05,15Goldfinger was fantastic
Octopussy
It's totally aginst everything bond he get's through on his wits and gadets .
alright, all the Bond films: Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, Diamonds are Forever, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun (cont)
Is that
Is that a real thing, Meanwhile?
That's a James Bond movie
Octopussy :D
Meanwhile: double entandre?
Good grief.
05,15as was Thunderball and From Russia with Love
And I'm back :3
ive watched most bond mvies at some point
13yes it is a thing
WHY DO I EVEN NEED TO EXPLAIN THAT?
YOU GUYS SUCK AT WATCHING BOND.
cachi01, lol
The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy, A View To Kill
05,15Meanwhile I know that of which you speak!
umm how big?
0,14I tried watching Dr. No as a kid, couldn't do it
/me shrugs, having not watched many Bond movies
05,15For Your Eyes Only was good
05,15A View to Kill was good
I don't even think I watched any Bond movies. :S
I havint seen half of them but i need to track em down :/
Sigh. Stream needs a Bond week.
05,15OH SNAP ANIMUSIC

The Living Daylights, License to Kill, Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is Not Enough, Die Another Day, Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall
13is 3 out yet?
Heh they just played the bond theme on tv :/
0,14see, I know Die Another Day is considered to be really bad
0,14like, really, really bad
0,14but I liked it
05,15No idea. I didn't even know a 3 was in the works
Oh, I know, I say The World Is Not Enough. I liked the OP.
Fluttercry: I hated 8th grade -_-
Animusic?

Nope
I hate, hated Catwoman.

Ponies47, what have you doooooooooone
Never saw Catwoman, guess I'm lucky
Ponies47, chat derped? 6_9
it's from the UK so i'd imagine the shipping to be around half the asking price to here
05,15Catwoman was terrible, but not as bad as The Green Lantern
I think anne hathaway has done the best catwoman.representation
I only hate it more now that I'm older because I know it completely neutered (...haha) her backstory.
The Green Reynolds.
Doom was a great nostalgic romp :/ if you turn off your brain.
Catwoman was pretty terrible. Still nto QUITE as bad as Catwoman in Batman Returns
Oh god Fluttercry
13doom was fun :3
Catwoman was......*sticks finger in back of throat*
I want to unwatch that movie.
05,15Doom had that sweet FPS scene
0,14^
And then the chat just EXPLODED!
^
0,14best part
0,14aside from the Rock
Doom was like, "Hey look it's The Rock-the movie"
Fluttercry: they're making a sequel, you know?
Ponies47: youre lagging
05,15RAWRity if it doesn't have SUPER SHOTGUN I'm not seeing it
Really, if I could unwatch The Green Lantern, I could. I mean, how the hell do you fuck up THAT BADLY with GL?
13i liked that the movie borrowed more from doom 3 than the first 2, 3 actually had a world built up
twilight_sprinkle: Not anymore
0,14I also still need to see Green Lantern
^
No Saxy
Fluttercry: i meant green lantern
13don't do it saxy
13you'll regret it
SaxyPretender, do NOT see Green Lantern.
Fuck all the DC superhero movies.
No seriously I mean this.
05,15Well, a Doom 2 movie would just be 2 hours of dudes getting shot. and that's it
0,14PFFT
Just move it along Saxy, there's not even a Halle Berry.
>watch
You don't understand, Saxy.
>Green Lantern
13well doom 2 had a story of our hero kicking the demons off earth
Fluttercry: that's why it's good you can't screw it up.
13but doom 1/2 story was just text every seven levels
13so not as well folded in as doom 3
Green Lantern really did completely fuck over the titular hero.
Who played Hal Jordan again?
0,14Ryan Renolds
05,15Ryan Renolds
Saxy had you gone to see it in theatre you would probably be passed out drunk outside a pub even now.

0,14I will probably enjoy it
SaxyPretender, you're a Green Lantern fan, right?
0,14Yep.
LeHey 5 cookies to the first person to name 5 DC super hero movies to suck an additional 3 if you include at least three marvel.
.........
So you guys know how they're planning on making a Justice League movie, ala Avengers, with multiple super hero movies leading up to it?
13i have a partial moby discography here with some scattered singles
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Trailer/Intros: A Game of Shadows / Beautiful Ponies / My Little Sunshine / No More Vodka
Saxy, go watch Green Lantern. But you are obligated to come back here afterwards.
05,15Does it have the Bourne song?
13yes
0,14Crystaline_Shard, Black lightning, Mr. Fantastic, power Girl, Huntress, Blue beetle
Ryan Reynolds didnt looked happy in Ted....
13the original though, not the ultimatum remix which i want to track down at some point
Wait they made a black lightning movie?
13actually i really want the bourne OSTs
Well guess who it's rumored has been offered to direct the Justice League movie?
05,15cachi01|phone is it bad that I actually sort of enjoyed that movie?
0,14I just thought you wanted names of DC superheroes
13tags on this say it's from tomorrow never dies

I like black lightning :/
05,15I remember this

I just want to see you rage, Saxy.
SaxyPretender: and directed "The Spirit"

13i have no idea where i picked up this stuff by moby, so apologies for quality
0,14also, this is awesome!
This reminds me of some Bond game for PS2.
05,15I had the Tomorrow Never Dies game as a kid.
His name is like an unspoken curse
05,15I liked it then, but it was probably terrible
To even think it is to bring doom to us all
13oo that reminds me
0,14also also, now that I think about it, Goldeneye was my first FPS ever
13somehow..
05,15SaxyPretender me too

Goldeneye was the Bond game

DINOSAURS ON A SPACESHIP
Reikim: or for the lighter stuff, elfen lied
Asuka
WHAT A WEAK EPISODE HUH
Reikim: stupid name, decent episode.
RAWRity: I thought EL was good?
Reikim: it's not.
Well shit
EL?
it's gore 'n' titties masquerading as something deeper.
05,15Matt Smith is just.....not doing it for me. He's okay, but I feel like he's getting worse.
Anyway, Dinosaurs on a Spaceship felt really weak to me.
05,15And I just feel dirty whenever River Song shows up
Fluttercry: he's a fine actor to me, but the writing for his character is inconsistent thanks to Moffat
Granted, I left off from Who after a rerun of Doomsday, sooooo
05,15RAWRity I figured that was the issue.
Random question: what's a good space ship name?
00,10yeah well I will have to skip to 11th
0,14The Buster Wol-
InB4 the Doctor gets gunned down by a disgruntled fan and regenerates into someone coler

GITS!

05,15Polydunami it was fun. Mostly for the news. not the 4 hour music downloads
aha the second gig

Hey Yoko Kanno. STOP BEING AWESOME.
I guess so :S
05,15I'll stay for the opening, but then I have to go :(
HEY SKY. STOP BEING BLUE ON A CLEAR DAY.
Haha so true
Speaking of Bustah Wolf, there was this flash video about someone spending a day with Terry Bogard, and he adopted a puppy and named it BUSTER WOLF (since all of his lines are taken from the games). That video missed what could be an awesomejoke.
Dammit Shizu you're going to have me staying up late again
what is this show called?
05,15One day I really want to stream Power Rangers for you all

If I ever get to stream, Imma stream Serial Experiments Lain in its entirety
/me fidgets
Hello Kurra
05,15SaxyPretender you now must go and get pictures
0,14Indeed!
Oh hey, Kurra, didn't see you there :$
all 13 episodes, and see if anyone in chat understands it.
my birthday is tomorrow ;.;
Lain. That one...intrigues me.
I take your challenge, RAWRity
00,10this ep is a bit mind fucky
Back. So is Sumi up now?(Thanks Shizuka for all the music)
When is tomorrow for you, Kurra?
Lain is a show that you HAVE to have your thinking cap on to understand.
Can't be any more mindfuckery than Paprika.
in a little bit c.c
Like, it gives you all the information necessary to understand it, but never sits down to explain it to you. It expects YOU to connect the dots.
this guy is being hacked??
13oh it's the pilot guy right
Ouch
g2g see ya guys
One of the things he says a lot is "GET SERIOUS". And there happens to be a pet stain removal solution on the market CALLED Get Serious.
See you, Tiberium126
guy i got my house back :)
13i have paprika here
bye Tiberium126
13maybe should do that some time
DUDE LOOK FORWARD
Also, Kurra, are you in the Eastern time zone?
Paprika was fun for the animation and mind fucky. That one scene though was...kind of really creepy.
EST?
hi eveypony
Hey, something
Reikim in the bucks
He has to go to his "mane" job.
hi something
hoi something
i got my house back yay
/me Q_Qs and wriggles into someone's arms and hides
hello
Hey Bluestrom_S. Long time no see?
hoi Bluestrom_S
Hey there, Bluestrom_S
hi Bluestrom_S
hi
hi all I've been playing guild awrs 2
hi Bluestrom_S
wars
i hate that game
why something ?
i sigh up and it wont let me play
I like shows that fiddle with the idea of reality
What was it called...some movie...
Memories?
how come?
waaaiiit
i dont know
isnt japan you know... asain?
Asian, Ryunosuke?
There was an anime film, a series of shorts, called Memories. It was pretty mindscrewy. I watched it back when I was still watching Naruto. About the same time I left Naruto behind.
00,10Shizuka, probably can explain it best
Ryunosuke: I think they mean Aisia Majowr, and not the Japanese Islands. For some reason.
Ryunosuke, technically Japan is separate from Asia.
Reikim I KNOW MEMORIES D8
ahh I see what they mean
I also can't type tonight.
Magnetic Rose freaked the hell out of me as a kid.
13explain this ep? this one weirds me out too :3
lol
Anypony ever seen Angel's Egg? That one was... interesting :$
"Reset the World." And suddenly I think of RahXephon.
Che Guevara o.o
00,10these eps have the tachikomatic days too btw Shizuka
13yay~
dat Che :3
And thyere is the definition of a Conspiracy Theorist.
I was gonna say that Kurra
0,14...wait, I just realized that's Liam O'Brian
13those confuse me even more this season :3
0,14AKIHIKOOOO
/me enjoys being puzzled, alongside Shizuka c:
00,10oh hi section 9
Shizuka, this guy is a disgruntled war vet.
uhoh
O HAI
13i think because 2nd gig has three categories of episode rather than season 1's more consistent arc i get lost easier
Dat hair
...Wow. The Major can actually pull off that cut.
13does some great worldbuilding though
thats one hot Major
13this guy though, he's just weird
Like, it takes serious skill to pull off a haircut like that.
Very few women in this world can unironically wear that haircut.
Also, the Major.
13the cats eye ep is awesome though
00,10looks like a boxing helm
00,10that is next Shizuka
13yup :3
Ah, Cat's Eye.
Shizuka : indeed thats a great episode
Ah, I give up
Night guys.
00,10night
13yeah this ep i just don't get
night Reikim
13i think most of it is he's having visions of how he'd kill that guy
0,14later rei-
He's fantasizing over this mysterious woman.
0,14awww
The imagiings of a conspircy riddled mind.
I need to do that
13angels feathers is a good one too, batou's human side
Oh, that was in his mind xD
0,14alternatively, it would be like an Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge
Shizuka, yes. He's dreaming of killing the CEO of one of the major news media
he has less of an adam's apple, and more of an adam's grape fruit
Did you get a new one?
SaxyPretender: that's a really neat story.
0,14Indeed
no
an adam's cantaloupe
an adam's WATERMELON
Kurra :D
00,10an adams jenson
This reminded me of Citizen Kane.
13oh i can sum up this episode
adam's prize-winning champion 550-pound PUMPKIN
13it's like when you're playing TF2
13but you lag and snap back like ten feet
your average dayz server
i hate that
Shizuka, it's like the movie, and 5201 or 2501 or whatever that number is....
what WAS up with that number 5201?
Hey I just popped into the chat, what show is this?
Shizuka, and you reach the conclusion that the whole world is going to pot because of Saxton Hale?
Cya everypony
0,14Ghost in the Shell, Dester

A few straws short of a haybale!
13he's not the sharpest crayon in the happy meal

Polydunami: i dont know, 2 weeks
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music: Wings of the Pegasi // Nightmare in the Light // Inner Struggle //
13he's eight bits shy of a byte
Shizuka: I haven't seen a crayon in a Happy Meal in DECADES.
I leave with this. http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3r2uk4/ good night.
00,10he's a few metafors short of a chat room
He's not playing with a full deck XD
13X3
13sumica wins it
hehe Sumica
A happy meal with crayons sound like a law suit waiting to happen
Dovah: that was so cute
He's a few inches short of a Batou.
See you, Dovah
^^:D
bye Dovah
Well, he's got a LOT of PTSD to cope with. So we shouldn't go hating on him
Oh hell
>_>
13big club
wb you two
0,14oh my?
He's almost ENTIRELY made of PTSD.
Kandarihu, yeah. I'm just making fun of insanity analogies

13to throw the phone ON THE GROUND
13press 3
I have a cup on my knee
They STILL have non-intelligent answering machines?
00,10what are you doing dude, you are not pregnet

00,10cyborgs
They have cybernetic bodes.
0,14ewww
oh, but they don;t they need like a nutritium bar or something like that
Or at least, so he believes.
oh yeah?
http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/thechairman45/RobotnikWHYsig.jpg
However, people (like Batou) can still have cyber food, which... I guess is used to fuel cybernetic parts?
to supply whats left of the brain?
i have 15 cups on my head
BEAT THAT
13snow is a big thing this season
13duhhhhh
00,10they eat out of habit
oh man, the hurt
da da duum
because food tastes good
LOL
but they don't taste food.
So is this real, now?
Yep
so random >.>
THis strongly reminds me of a story of which i can completely remeber the title of
"To a machine, all reality is virtual." ;)
Adjeca you must play that pinball machine :)
13he needs a huggy jacket
like a short story
13and a nice soft room
It would be so awesome if it played spyro music
00,10self huging jackets are nice
:o it would
Dayum that hacking
heh maybe this weekend
hey, you got red on you
Kurra , that;'s interesting considering a human is an organic machine
Dester, it's a line from the Anmatrix.
I watched that so long ago Kurra I barely remeber a thing
0,14...mfw I'm realising that these are Naoto's and Akihiko's VA from P4A talking
Cool to see how humans provoked tghe whole matrix thing
Dester, worth seeing again, as the issues covered in it are becoming more and more relevant.
00,10what kind of std causes you to lose every thing below the torso?
0,14O_O
13a virus :3

00,10so his flopy drive got damaged in some ladys io port?
i wonder how?
pinkie handeld the unicornz in cupcakez?
13his hardware was incompatible with her software
it'S becasue he touched himself at night
eh, it made sense to me. it was pretty much a character illustration ep
13if you know what i mean
why would they need sex if they're machines
I don't think he had any hardware.
00,10oh right he had a robot arm and did not practis with a hotdog first
TopHat some as why they want to eat, its fuin, it instinct

Tits. Tits everywhere in this show

GURL how you fit in dem jeans

It is a dub

13this is still one of the best dubs ever
You can't expect it to be perfect
Good evening everypony.
sumica, physics?
^^^^
oh yeah
Hi Lunar_Brony
13even the japanese rarely matches up with lips
Sumica: The Major has tiny tiny bolts in her hip to fasten them to.
They work some serious magic though with dubs by re-rediting and stretching some loops of animation.
hi Lunar_Brony
they just opan and close their mouths in all anime anyway
13yes
Kencolt no way? o.o
0,14She's in that Persona game I keep talking about
13see she's not actually "wearing" clothes
13they're part of that body
gah, I'm in pain an it hurts to outstretch my left arm. I can't grab my drink . . .
twilight_sprinkle: Well, it would take much more time to animate if they change the movemoent of their lips every timed they talked.
This soundtrack
AJIsAwesome|Busy: i know
...
Creeeeeepy!
I don't want to say it
00,10she's nude, she is just hacking every ones brains to make you think she has clothing

13also their secretary AIs dress up nice don't they
Sumica shouldn;t that be an easy thing to gaurd against?
Like a simple piece of soft ware that blocks eveything not speech
00,10you would think Dester
hubba hubba
not bad
at ease batou
13Dester: speech is haaaaard to isolate
I would whistle if I could
13the AIs are pretty :)

Shizuka then anything that quickly changes tones and volumes in a way that is not indicative of typical talk
tachkomas Daaaww
I forgot the Tachkomas are back for a sec

Mmhmm :3

Sumica I can't imagine why >_>
* lurks*
13pretty funny how many obvious budget shots there are when things get dialogue heavy :3
most of these guys seem to have some sort of complex :p
These sex androids are pretty creepy as a concept
Are they statues? :O
as it were
and thing
a ... stand alone... complex
dat background
Shizuka: seeing how these guys talk in their mind, the whole conversation is a budget saving shot B)
im 12 and whats this?
13hey he stole one of the secretaries :<
I couldn't do it with a machine
see... a complex
girl vending machine>
?
"budget" makes me think of my english teenager. When she dissaproves of something, she says something like "That's so budget". Annoys the crap outta me, yet I've started to say it too . . .
I don't know why I'm telling you this tho

I've had those moments
there was a shot with lasers
sorry, I just came back from doing pre-planned sparring. It was quite fun, but I"m tired as hell

Egad
I can't grab my drink

What about the other arm?
IKR?
Get up and grab drink with right arm?
Okay who asked about the body suit?
pointless acrobatics are best

Wait, which one is Pazu again?

Dark_Horst so the best way around lasers is to run full front?
Meh. Good luck, then
PANIC

GITS Tachikoma Shorts Trivia: In the segment where a cubic machine inflates the Tachikoma, that small cubic machine is used as a cyber body by a CEO of a cybernetics firm in the GITS series. He is so fanatical about his company's machines that he transferred his brain into a very non-human chassis, even though much more human-like bodies were available.

Mr. Twilight's-Dad's Hair-do reminds me of Aladdin.

That's all right Sumi, I was just checking to see if I missed any or not that's all
I'm somewhat surprised people actually bought this
Sumica I cleared my cache and refreshed, still no survey I see, I tried also with Firefox, and Sigh Internet Exploror, no survery
I'm not, Lunar_Brony: children playing CoD.
anymore suggestions?
00,10might have to pok Shizuka, she knows more about the page tech then I
11,02flutterchu: You sure like Eddsworld don't you :)
it's different and interesting, but most who play FPS's wouldn't even consider the Wii as a gaming console
NewSuperBronyU: *nods*
I'm surprised the parents are lenient on such content, actually.
Trixie at her Trixiest: http://fav.me/d5g04js
Im not familiar with the term pok
OH God
no
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
11,02There were well over 1000 preorders at the GameStop near my college for Modern Warfare 3...
IT BURNS!
11,02When I asked how many preorders they had for the Wii
11,02They said like 3 >>
NewSuperBronyU: WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO US!?
/me hands otakon a blindfold and earmuffs
11,02otakon: D:
DAMN YOU CALL OF DOOTY!
11,02I was the only one at the midnight launch who got the Wii version :3
6Yeah :P
Gamecube is not an option
I disaprove of this game
11,02The guy at the counter was like 'PS3 or Xbox?' I said 'Neither, Wii' :3
ha
It sucks typing, eh? :p
13we are watching The Nunchuk Or Classic Controller is Required
13didn't get good rating from what i heard
13oh
13silly mips
NewSuperBronyU is a hipster
NewSuperBronyU: you bought the graphically and control wise inferior Wii version? WHY????????????????????
NewSuperBronyU, you know they laughed at you once you were out of the store, right?
lol-ed
6Son of a laggy waffle.. ._.
That's because Wii gets a worse version
NewSuperBronyU: it doesn't even have proper multiplayer with Nintendo's crappy online service
11,02kirzstryfe: I honestly don't care :P
noone wants it
and theres also a 15-20 second lag before your typing shows up yeah :p
except you
^:(
otakon, distract yourself with awesome hunchback refrence: http://fav.me/d5g0srt
Engi: bc they have to make a seperate version since it's about only as powerful as a Gamecube
/me glomps Engi
11,02I shouted out to the 300+ people in line outside after grabbing my copy, 'WII RULES!' while showing my copy of the game to them :3
you've probably never heard of the wii
/me snuggles Rain :3
/me was looking for an excuse to post that >_>
13rain rain~<3
/me hugs Shizuka and Engi :3
6Kinda..especially when it takes forever to open :P
6Yeah xD
13you missed lots of shizumusic :<
11,02otakon: Wrong, the Wii is 3x more powerful than the GCN and about 2x more powerful than the Xbox.
You find out anything about your computer?
if that's true
NewSuperBronyU: and yet NOTHING on it is more impressive than a Gamecube game
it doesn't use any of that power
Silver_Spoon you could've just said "random pic incoming!"
11,02otakon: Trolololol
wii is pathetic :\
NewSuperBronyU: seriously I haven't seen ANYTHING to show otherwise
tl;dr
Lunar_Brony: this is true
aww, that sucks, Shizuka :<
and dont be mean, Engi. Wii is good in its own way.
reading's for nerds
/me cant get enough of Brawl
11,02Not Super Mario Galaxy 2? Metroid Other M? The Conduit? CoD?
6Nope.. >.<
NewSuperBronyU: Twilight Princess ran the EXACT SAME on the Gamecube, hell the Gamecube version was actually the TRUE version of the game. They mirror swapped TP on the Wii because Link always uses his left hand for swordplay.
damn :/
Rain: CoD doesn't count
I like Galaxy 2 and Other M
havent played, wasnt impressed, havent played, hate CoD
Er, didn't mean to ping you with that
she will never burn angel.......never
11,02Well DUH, it was a GCN game that was ported over to the Wii, OFC it ran the exact same :P
NewSuperBronyU: looks the same as Sunshine, looks the same as Prime, looks like Snowblind on the PS2. CoD looks like CoD on the PS2.
and if im wrong
NewSuperBronyU: no no it wasn't
You try to get it fixed anywhere?
MAKE THE DAMN SALAD YOURSELF
NewSuperBronyU: it was a WII game ported to the Gamecube
I wish other M looked like prime
11,02Yes it was otakon, the game was in development long before they even announced the Wii
The Wii is a novelty systme
0,14just to step in and clarify something
11,02otakon: Oh wow...I honestly don't even know where to begin to point out how wrong you are with that...so I'll just let you keep bitching :)
0,14Other M looks nothing like Prime
otakon is it still a novelty system now that it is still around?
i'm back with muffins, what did i miss?
0,14Prime looks awesome, Other M not so much
and with kinect out?
It's barely aroun
*around
0,14aside from that, continue with the kvetching everywhere
13Dester: refresh
NewSuperBronyU: how so? It has lackluster third party games, graphics, internet gameplay.
13someone forgot to mark it public when activating is all
SaxyPretender: it's called idiots wanting the next big thing
finally, now it works, thank you
basically
0,14I meant from a graphical standpoint
Now I am however not calling anyone here an idiot for buying it
Why is Ice Cube on your squad in this game?
all ye nintendo fanboys, enjoy your wii
fire place is always the best place to hang out when youre talking to yourself (espicially when it's taller than you)
0,14Other M's pretty bland, Prime has a bit more detail to it
just don't try to tell us it's as good as the others
I only know one person who tried to defend Other M and his argument's were weak at bast.
Engi I will. And my 3DS. And my Gamecube. And my DSi. And my SNES. And my NES. And my other NES.
SaxyPretender: yeah how is it that PRIME looks better than Other M even though the latter is newer and on a supposedly more powerful system?
11,02Darn
Lunar_Brony: NES, SNES, and gamecube aren't too bad
6We're going to give it to get checked son from what I know..
not the most precise controls is what i see. then again, that'S what you get for playing shooters with anything else than a mouse
They've gotten worse over time
wish I had a 64
0,14I was referring to prime 3
Prime 3 is awesome
Lunar_Brony: No 64? :O
0,14but yeah, the Prime series as a whole looks better than Other M
I fucking loved my 64
because team ninja thought they could take something and TOATALLY CHANGE IT and thought people would like it better
Call of Douchebag: Host Migration
^^
0,14in any case, still am wanting to play Other M spoiler free
AJIsAwesome|Busy no. I went from SNES to Gamecube without touching a 64 controller once.
6*soon
6I gtg.. >.<
Favorite game on 64: Mario Party.
my N64 my GameCube my PS2 my XBOX 360 my WII my 3DS my any kind of DS my EVERYTHING UP TO N64
oh thats good

I hear whispering
And it's FREAKING ME OUT MAN!
Inb4 door opens
/me likes to stick it to the Console Wars
Eh Ill stick with my PS1 classics. Colony warz future cop L.A.P.D Duke nukem. :/
NewSuperBronyU: were you trying to play online?

DerpyWhooves: actually he has to do something before that happnes
/me never had a PS2
/me takes his bike out and sticks it to every graphics card that will ever exist ;)
because your connection was horrible when you were playing with Derpy and me the other day >_<
Crystaline_Shard: Metal Gear Solid...policenauts..oddworld...all dem excellent PS1 games
umm I don't know if id be pissed
0,14ah Bayonetta 2
i had a PS2 but then it ran away :'( *derp*
0,14I flipped my shit about that game
0,14then I learned why
oddwooooooooorld
more like dissapointed I mean
0,14and then I begrudingly thanked Nintendo
Yeah
Oddworld was fucking awesome
SaxyPretender: mhm
so basically, flutterchu sold her ps2
woops i said her
Still bullshit no one wanted to publish it
i think my s is working
Don't have those :/ most of my games for PS1 are my friends I lacked money at the time so i didin't buy many.
11,02Platinum games said that Bayonetta 2 wouldn't have been possible without Nintendo publishing the game.
0,14yep
^
0,14so my hate's directed at Sega
Platnium..... wait they did madworld right ?
whatcha playing, NewSuperBronyU?
Crystaline_Shard: lol, I played my stepdad's pirated games
Sega, you're digging your own grave.
0,14yep
my hate is directed at microshit
is this
who is playing?
my hate is directed at apple
0,14and then Sega announced SA2 for XBLA
Mircosoft? Micro trasaction haha.
I saw that. Still getting it.
Sega was digging its own grave ever since they thought they could get away with using 6 AA batteries to power a handheld. That was just ridicularity unbounded.
11,02NiGHTS into Dreams is coming to PC, Xbox 360 and PS3 :D
Mainly because I miss SA2.
11,02I'm so happy for it ^_^
now now, be nice to the poor microsoft employee who's also an admin >_<

*^^
0,14I still have my GCN copy of SA2:B

0,14still getting SA2
0,14bro's pitching in for the DLC
11,02Still have my copy of SA2 on the Dreamcast :3
The sonic series is dying, we need some good ideas to bring it back. I know, let's give him werewolf powers, a sword, and alien powers
What is the draw of NIGHTS anyway looked like alot of nonsense to me :/ never seen it in stores so i couldint check it out.
blackcops for wii?
Can't wait to get the HD remake. SO AWESOME! /)^3^(\
11,02^
0,14....unfortunately, the Guilty Gear Accent Core Plus port is coming out
0,14October 23
0,14so I either get the best Sonic game I've ever played
TopHat: say what you want I love sonic and the black knight :/
TopHat hey. I like Sonic Colours. They didn't fuck it up
0,14or the best fighting game I've ever played
^^
can't argue, I've never played sonic colors
I LOVED Sonic Colrs.
*Colors :D
I only have 1 sonic ame
Sonic 3 was my limit.
Everyone I know who played colors said it was garbage. :/
*game
The Werehog could've easily been replaced with Knuckles, however.
same here Kurra. Sonic2 4 life
2D sidescrolling forever.
0,14Colors was pretty acclaimed iirc
0,14better than 06
0,14...then again, most games are
0,14XD

:D
dammit nintendo can you please make more franchises
I draw the line at sonic heroes, they hit a wall at shadow the hedgehog
Sonic 06 almost killed Sonic. :D
I just saw the weirdest video... unfortuneatly I cant link it to you untill the stream is over....
what ever happened to that other recent sonic game?
Sonic 4?
It's okay at best.
11,02Host \:D/
Not as good as the original 3.
no the other one the one with new soic and old sonic.
*three
go SB go!
like, honestly, if 2D is challenging and fun as heck to play, it's not a sin to not need 3D.
Crystaline_Shard: Oh, Generations.
0,14man, I'm jonesing for Guilty Gear
yeah that one
Guilty Gear XDDDD
wanna see a cancelled sonic game (the only picture of an unamed sonic game)
generations was good apparently
sure
0,14and then...the eventual +R patch
why not?
i'm back. internet went for poop
I have suuuch good memories of watchign and playing games from Anthrocon 2005... :3
I read they fucked up two songs from SA2B so i didin't get it.
0,14GGAC+R, Y U NO IM MY LIFE YET ;____;
To be honest, I found the 2D parts in Modern Sonic games pointless.
good night guys
They could've just made Modern 3D and Classic 2D in Generations.

yay!
YAY!
yay Rayman!
I never like ray man.
fjdksjfr
^^ Until Rayman Origins
no limbs makes for easy animation
no I never liked rayman at all :/
Rayman Origins made me fall in live with Rayman for the first time.
in live?
I couldn't stand the early Rayman games. :$
Ray Man is in the same place as mario sonic crash bandicoot ect.
Not Crash.
Yes crash.
Crash is technially dead.
Kind of like Bubsy.
In terms of popularity.
but hes still part of the same thing platforming.
True, but the games for him were atrocious.
crash still lives on in our hearts
Son'ys responce to mario or he was suppost to be.
The GOOD crash.
Wasn't Crash Twinsanity the last Bandicoot game released?
As of today
o.o
BATUCADA
Then they made him speak........I can still remember that line. :|
hated crash to to be honest and banjo.
lol
E o Tchan and all that
Crash Team Racing
Never saw the hype in Banjo, even though it's a good game.
Crash Bash
Crash Bandicoot: Warped
^
Good times, good times.
It sucks that there hasn't been any new people around lately
the classic are usually better..
is he fighting a angry bird?
what is haping

NewSuperBronyU: the liquid of life
just plain?
11,02Yeah o.o
yeah I know, we were seeing new people last week
Mods here post humans :/
Take Rayman, for example. I hated the old Rayman games, but new Rayman blew me out of the water.
<--- Milkshake... *sips* ^3^
da hello
o.o
I haven't had a milkshake in years.
i repet the hell
That's really awesome
dat one ugly bird...
I concur
I just couldn't get into Rayman as a kid.
You wanna buy it, don't you :p
where are all these kirby games coming from?????
A awesome place.
anyone want to see a translation of stop N swop
I love the flying sections in this game.
aiity then
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Well part of the hype for Banjo was the whole Stop n' Swop thing that was a huge buzz back in the day
However, there was a lot of stuff they cut out.
I'm trying to find a video of it
its italian but thank google translate
maybe..
After eight years since Banjo-Tooie on the Nintendo 64, and three by the release of the spin-off Banjo-Pilot on GameBoy Advance, in November 2008, the bear and the bird back in a new adventure on Xbox 360, following acquisition of Rare by Microsoft.The game has several references to the Stop 'N' Swop, as well as the Stop 'N' Swop working, which I'll discuss in the next section, however.The game takes place primarily in the new Hub Wo
J_E_Smith71: I know that, but I just couldn't get into it.
what the hell did i just watch?
11,02i liek banjo-kazooie :3c
also, DAT TEXT WALL
NewSuperBronyU: READ IT
Buying an arcade machine, or in this case a pinball machine is a big first step in building a video game collection :)
11,02I know about it O.O
AYYYYEYEEEEEEE IM A CLOUD
yeah
You can like Banjo Kazooie if you want, but I'm just not into it as most people.
brb
and RUN!
bajo kazooie nuts and blots suck
Wait a minute, did they cut out the SFX for Rayman beating on the treasure chest? :S
I didn't hear it for some reason.
wern't they suppost to be linked together some how.
here
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTVPffQl3sw
Stop N Swop?
only rayman game I've played is raving rabids. If that counts
11,02Nooooo
dead
ouch
bad 64 bad!
If so, they were supposed to be but never was used until Nuts N Bolts. They would get you new parts.
no diing!
TopHat: NO.
NOT RAVING RABBIDS
That is NOT Rayman.
I know
it's warioware with rabbits
TopHat: Just saying.
I liked the idea, but the fact that they made so many just bored me to death.
sooooooooooooooooo
so what kind of Limbo mod is this?
11,02Darn :/
o.o...
you can do it!
no you can't! :/
what just being realistic XD
I love the music on it

NewSuperBronyU: Don't fly onto the enemies. Run and leap into them. It should chain for you.
*leap onto
this music is so..... applejack!!!
^
hehe
<3
>_>
BULLSHIT!
>_><_<
otakon: neh?
THAT FUCKING BLUE THING
The least they could do is put a midway checkpoint
Applejack needs some more acoustic guitar in her BGM.
TopHat: why are you mad
Think i'm a head off for the night.
that thing didn't even LOOK like an enemy at first

/me throws computer
use chaos control
otakon: True, but they want you to make mistakes so that the next time you attempt it you won't do it again.
TopHat: rong game
you failed!
If they didn't do that, then critics would hate this game for these segments.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: and then you slip up from doing the same motions 42 times in a row
YOu get nothing you LOSE!
*gives cookie*
otakon: asssssssssssssss
Scottish-geeky: yes
Distraction!! http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mav5umHLuF1rok3x6o5_r2_500.gif
What happened to the bunnies
otakon: lol
/me steals the cookies while everyone is distracted
you have to learn every move, every obstacle, every trap
otakon but even then, you just keep making mistakes anyway
otakon: I have. I know what you mean. I'm just saying that at least you get rewarded for thse kinds of things instead of like Street Fighter 2010.
if you wanna be the guy
no BarbetosSMASH
True, these things could've been toned down
TopHat: your a trap
how did you know
So this game was made for 10 year olds right?
TopHat: im the doctor
I am going to bed now. night everyone! Thanks for the stream NewSuperBronyU
:D

yay another tooth...
Hrm. I should take that smash out of my name
Eh. Oh well.
11,02This game is an amazing platformer that pretty much gives Mario a run for his money.
Games today have no difficulty whatsoever, making it boring and lowers the replayability.
^^
I like buying a kirby game and finishing it in 45 minutes
i like buying a kirby game then rage quiting cause i suck
NewSuperBronyU: the new super mario wii is not as good as a game i was hoping for
I'm glad that this game is incredibly hard. Makes me feel like I worked for it.
USed to play WoW until I found out you can't beat the game. :p
You can't? :S
11,02Scottish-geeky: I liked it actually and can't wait for New Super Mario Bros. U to come out.
no you can't
i miss the old warcrafft
^
11,02New Super Mario Bros. 2 was the weakest link
building all my units and builidngs...
Ah the old days when max level was 60
NewSuperBronyU: i like the game its just not what i had hoped for
NewSuperBronyU: dude there is NOTHING new about "New" Super Mario Bros. U
except for the gold coin firepower
^
Tenderhaert no the old old one
that's it
I been minecraft
I never found the point of NSMB2.
beat*
It's just coins. That's it.
Ah you mean the RTS.
and wast with netado and puting new in fornt of evry mairo game
They haven't done anything to shake up the Mario platforming formula in 20 years
Or just mainly centered around them.
Tenderheart yup
otakon: i agree
I have it on on the shelf behind me
Don't get me wrong, it looks like a great game. I just don't see myself playing it.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: i dont plan on playing it ehter
Tenderheart I never got to play the first one
Plus, NSMBW was a chore for me. The only way I was able to beat the game was by myself. The co-op was annoying.
Tenderheart only the 2nde and third
I play coop with my brothers and troll the whole time
TopHat: good man
Thats where I'm getting at. You can't really work together in NSMBW because of that.
13how many times can they release the same mario game before they aren't allowed to call it "new" anymore
happy face :)
NEW new super mario bros wii
Shizuka: once
Shizuka: they've been lying since Super Mario Bros. 2
i got to go evry pony night

lol
ded
TopHat: WHen they mean origins in this game, they mean that they are returning to the classic 2D game play.
I guess it's acceptible then
There was an unused story where this game was supposed to be the origin of Rayman and everything in the Rayman universe.
I remember the 2d format...I had Rayman on a desktop ages ago. I loved it so much. Wasted so many hours on it :D
DAT PAUSE
that one bump is killing him...
you should get that checked out
Mr. Dark was also supposed to be in this game, but he got scrapped. His boss music can be found in the coding, though.
so anything planned for thanksgiving bronystate?
nope
11,02AJIsAwesome|Busy: Don't spoil the game for me :(
Sorry. :$

The notion of beating this game without dieing repeatedly in frustrating ways is like trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet, whilst wearing a blindfold, riding a horse.

Here's a relaxing song for you guys :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1L1rQYGatw
hi DoctoDoctorWho
Ohai DoctoDoctorWho
good morning everypony
or afternoon
3:23 AM here :D
or midday
dr.octgonapusBUUUUUUUU
125 here
So I've spent the past 2 hours trying to host a dedicated server for a game...
I'm about to flip a table
Or snake headed bird-dragon thing on the mayan calander
>.< Clicked on my own lick, realise I linked wrong song
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESoBLgrFVJU
however your culture keeps time
is it a tekkit server :3
Nah, Killing Floor :/
awww, goldy and snow arent here
oo haven't played that in a while
noticed a mistake and fixed it
guess Ill just have to settle for AJIsAwesome
better? http://sta.sh/0e4nbu1vwhr
Hm?
/me glomps aforementioned pony
/me dodges glomp
Im still working on my OC, cant think of a decent name tho...
DoctoDoctorWho, ooh, I like names, give me a discription
Not sure if I should scrap my OC.
/me launches heat seeking glomp
/me freezes himself, negating heat seeking glomp
back
flash crashed
I know that feel
Well, he's tall. About 6 inches short of princess celestia,
so does it look better? it was pointed out that the horn was off centered
DoctoDoctorWho, how about Burning hoof? I dunno
/me seeing AJIsAwesome frosen, switches to manual and guidance glomps him
Dammit. :|
???
He is also steel grey, with a dark blue mane/tail
AJIsAwesome: :$
/me breaks free of ice and engags jet pack :D
*engages
Quick! to the glomp-mobile! *batman transition noise*
:O
"You'll never get me!"
/me engages plane mode
oh yeah?
*turns arms into drills and tunnels underground
Giga
Drill,
...
NO..
BRRRREEEEAAAAAAAKKKKEEEEEERRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!
AHHHHHH!!
youknow
/me drill-glomps AJIsAwesome
/me stops the drill
/me pre dodges
the main antagonist is "The Alchemist", he is wearing what appears to be a metal suit... that would in fact make him a ... Full Metal Alchemist
in T2
/me also realizes that RP is getting excessive and we should stop.
well
thanks for your help
night all
/me agrees
NIght, Panda|Sleepies L)
Night Panda|Sleepies
*:)
Ryunosuke: ed might kill you over that
so any good names? Im trying to incorporate the word "steel" into it
What does it look like?
So is anyone queued up soon?
??
AJIsAwesome: He's a unicorn stallion about 6 inches shorter than Celestia, with a steel grey coat and dark blue mane
a name w/ steel in it
eeyup
Steel Massimo?
what about stalin
that sounds like a wresteler
<_<
taoumi: :D
It's a Megaman X Reference. :D
AJIsAwesome: never played, sorry :$
It's okay. :S
*:D
my idea is to model it after the grey knights
AJIsAwesome: you have heard of them, right?
Nope :D
/me engages twilecture mode
yeah i think i should make a dj-pon3 plushie for convention modeling
The grey knights are the legendary 666th chapter of the Adeptus Astartes, and chamber militiant to the Ordo Malleus. Their specialty is Anti-chaos Incursion
or for a shorter explination, watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUcIhkL8HPM
the chat is dead, the chat is dead, someone dropped it on its head. It didn't cry, it didn't meow, it didn't make a sound.
we chopped it up to itsy bits, and mixed with some apple bits, and we mixed all together and baked it ina pie. :U
/me drops PinkieSpice on his head
Got classes in the morning. Night, everyone! :)
bye AJIsAwesome
/me hugs DoctoDoctorWho goodnight :)
/me brohugs back
Alright, have a good night everyone! :)
nighty?
;A;
DoctoDoctorWho, Are those Inquisitors?
why you drop me?
I can see that emblem from that expansion of Dawn of war 2
Goodnight AJIsAwesome|Asleep
CrimsonPhoenix: no, they are a space marine chapter, they do however, work alongside Inquisitors
Aaaah
would make sense
I'm no expert in Warhammer but I know a very few tihngs
On a badass scale of 1/10, with an average space marine scoring 7, they score 12
DoctoDoctorWho, one question about DoW Darkcrusade, why do the Blood Ravens have the Grey Knights units when (iirc) they are from different chapters?
like SPESS MUHREENS http://youtu.be/MbRGg3e1b68
AdamTheDuck: I never heard that, where's your source?
DoctoDoctorWho, this is the RTS computer game, not the actual game >.<
DoctoDoctorWho, http://wiki.reliccommunity.com/index.php?title=Grey_Knights for referance
Did I kill chat? :<
In-game their abilities may differ, but in accordance with their lore they could deliver a godly asskicking to anything short of a titan legion
In the campaign, why are they serving the Blood Ravens?
They are two different chapters
whats happening yall hows it going?
Sorry, that question has been on my mind since the release of that game's expansions :D
Hello Moopy
Nothing much really
cool
no clue, I only know that that would never happen in actual canon, unless the blood ravens were telepathicly clensed afterwards
Just spent 2 hours to try and host a dedicated server
Dang theres like 79 of us in the chat
Finally worked, except everyone but my friends can join lol
Randoms seems to be able to join fine xD
Space marine legions/chapters they fight beside are telepacthicly cleansed of all grey knight related memories, imperial guard regiments are simply executed
^ Gotta love the exterme Warhammer 40k lore ._.
extreme*
So i see theres nothing going on with the stream huh?
Yeah, no stream :/
go hard or go home
Oh
I've practicly memorised the GK page on the wiki
Hey does MeanWhile don't like when im mean sometimes?
When people think I'm mean, I just hug them. :3
Hmmm.....................
inb4 we all glomp MeanWhile
Heh glomp
sploosh

Quack
darius the fishbear

same thing happend to me when i saw trixy figure at walmart
I swear scar said that atleast once when making fullmetal alchemist
Moopy, how many hours ago was morning?
And what was usually on the stream?
Ummm........................i don't know dude
i was just asking thats all
Kerbals? Anime? Wii?
Moopy, because mods stream when they want to, so there's no set schedule
charge into battle with this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYQSDGY1LIM
Ok dude
So whoever is streaming in "your" morning might not be the same mod the next morning
Ah
DoctoDoctorWho, does Wrek stream this song? Sounds familiar :D
well nighty everypony
Goodnight taoumi
AdamTheDuck: Its sabaton, I belive it is a band he's fond of:)
...........
Hello there Princess_Cadence
/me hugs Princess_Cadence
/me hugs adam
Im contemplating wether or not to stay here or go work on my fanfic
DoctoDoctorWho, why not do both? :D
hi Princess_Cadence
hi somepony else
lol
AdamTheDuck: That, Is an excellent question.
Damnit, 'cause we need some life in this chat right now http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f0kPcxBx0E
So mods are asleep or mods are not always asleep?
Moopy, Wrek never sleeps, sleep does not exist for him. ._.
Hhahahah
But yes, seems that every other mod is asleep.
Oh
Or busy~
Ok i was looking at the ponychat theres like so many stuff in it
what is a man?
You know i can't even tell if theres any other bronies in my nieghborhood over here in North Carolina
same here
I know 2 other bronies at my school ._.
And we rarely even talk
caint find a single brony here
Cause i go outside ride my bike around and i cannot find any bronies dude
Maybe i'll just go buy a rainbow dash t shirt and find some bronies i guess
Moopy, it's simple, just get an icecream truck and play the Parasprite Polka song
really
:3
I am still waiting the day until one man in a Pinkie Pie cosplay manages to do a one-man-band march to that song.
Well i don't know about the ice cream truck dude i wanted to get a cool lookin car for myself not a icecream truck dude
but i will play something
^ My ideas are non sensical, you should learn that by now :P
Nope.avi
AdamTheDuck: Imma go try that now
DoctoDoctorWho, /)

TO BURN IT
I wasn't burning anything. :<
Damn chat is quiet today~ :<

Hello dedstate.
Phase4: nooooo! I haz wurk 2 dooo!
Hello Ninjazz

DoctoDoctorWho, so do i :P
Phase4: and stream continues regardless, sometimes I think the internet doesnt even give a buck.
ohai Ninjazz
DoctoDoctorWho, ikr
i do plan to continue kerbals at some point
tf2's seized up
Everything derpin'.
My hubby tried to make planes last night.
He made a couple that took off.
through sheer manly determination, I shall do the impossible! I shall IGNORE STREAM!!!
DoctoDoctorWho, Noooo, you won't survive!~
lol. DoctoDoctorWho. That's easy. The stream has a mute button. And if that's not enough, there is also a pause button. :P
Gold_Demona: ignore, WHILE PLAYING!
I IGNORE NOW!
DoctoDoctorWho: Ah, well. Good luck with that. =/
I have trouble ignoring the stream, and I've got a whole other computer to look at.
Well time to join Phase in his TF2 adventures~
Adam awaaay~
i've not played koth in a long time
still cant airblast
Is that party cannon? :D
Definitely, coffee is on eof the best things ever. :)
MMmmm~
I like the original better
Coffee is awesum :3
I don't know how I got through my mornings without it before.
It still amazes me how clear the picture is, Phase4. Not used to the chat on your screen being legible. :D
Gold_Demona, ikr!
i'ma keep using this software
o-o
hey
The sound seems to have improved also. We'll know for sure if you play something with a ton of bass.
Hiyo PinkieSpice and DaringDerpy
tf2?
Eeyup
sweet
thats a fun bug
who is this from?
Dissonance?
it'd kinda creepy
I think Imma work on my Nuzlocke comic today. ;)
Gold_Demona, oh boy, I bet you couldn't do something as great as the original person who came up with the idea
CrimsonPhoenix: Hell no. I'm not even gonna TRY to be that epic. 6_9
heeeeh ok
Working on Page 56 right now.
Nuzlocke?
Pokemon hard mode
Catch first encounter pokemon in the area only, if pokemon fainted you RELEASE IT
Sounds interesting, Ill make sure to check it out later.
there's tons of other rules that are optional but those two are obligatory
http://www.nuzlocke.com/archive.php
The idea is if a pok?mon faints, it's considered dead. So you're not allowed to use it anymore.
what are those big cones full of flowers called?
http://www.nuzlocke.com/challenge.php
I cant rememer for the life of me
DoctoDoctorWho: A bouquet?
thank you Gold_Demona
No problem :)
Well, the word "bouquet" refers more to the arrangement of flowers than the object it's contained in, but still. :P
/me is kicked for making annoying know-it-all comments.
Well, for those interested, here's my Nuzlocke comic. http://derpy.me/SEqSS
what is that thing with the deformed jaw supposed to be
Oh ffs. FTL's graphics are fucked up and I can't see anything in the menu.
huh?
helo freinds
with the tie

http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1348655370290.png
hello everyone
hi OneTrickPony
Hiyo OneTrickPony
and possibly not written as well, I don't know
Hanako: Yeah, my writings not that great. =/
AdamTheDuck: y dose AJIsAwesome have lAsleep at the end of his name
Hanako: Nor is my drawing. But hey, it's what I enjoy.
Gold_Demona: you haven't seen my chicken scratches :D
MadSurge: LOL :D
what is going on with my ping
Meh, I don't feel like berating you for it any more
therainbowvortex, some people change their nickname if they leave their computer on all the time to show what they're doing or if they're busy
automatically too easy
thats enought writing for this morning,
oh
i'm exceeding my bandwidth
Hanako: lol, yeah. There's plenty worse than mine, but there's also plenty better.
not sure how
AdamTheDuck gess what hapaned today it was reely relly sad
I tend to write very small, so people can't really read my writing :D
Phase4: You exceed it with your awesome
therainbowvortex, sad? :< But I'm in a cheery mood today.
Gold_Demona: at least you're honest
AdamTheDuck: i was watching mlp on tv today and my sister came in and changed it to wwe and yelled at me to be a man
Hanako: I'm WAY past my phase of trying to impress people and become popular. I know my style's not to most people's taste. So I'm happy just to have my small handful of fans. :)
therainbowvortex, oh man, that is cruel :D
Aww, that sucks therainbowvortex. :(
yer mabby but i just crakked up laughing
Heh, that's the way to do it. ^_^
therainbowvortex: bitch slap her and change it back, telling her to be a woman.
lol
Ironic fates for teh lulz
yer she should just get back in the kitchen
And make you a sandvich
wait did i spell kitchen right
Dat brandwidth slipping away
SANDVICH!
I do that every morning for my husband, and I'm happy with that role. :D
this is not working
Gold_Demona: what is popularity? :D I like making silly monsters
I go in the kitchen and make him a sandwich. Literally
wow Phase4 your team wasnt helping at all
MadSurge: I know right?
Gold_Demona: u not his bitch tho, you are a happy wife
Gold_Demona: you husband wait what :O
lol, true DoctoDoctorWho. That I am. :)
Yes, therainbowvortex. I haz husband, and I make sandwiches for him in the kitchen and pack them in his lunch every day.
sadly tho, I can never have a romantic relationship with anypony.
Gold_Demona: wait i got you confesed with someone eles
:(
RoboGerbil, ikr
therainbowvortex: lol, oh? Who'd you think I was. :P
?
punctuation fail there, don't mind me
noone im just kinda slow and got confeused
and now I must go, my planet needs me.
huh
ragequitting seizes tf2 now
Phase4, flip table~
goodbye ronies
with any hope a spot will open on the like-a-boss server
HL2.exe has stopped working *flip table*
bronies* b button sux
Bye DoctoDoctorWho
hl2.exe has stopped working and started flipping tables
lol
/me Walks into the chat sleepy
/me Yawns
Hiyo Ponies47
Good morning :3
/me flips Ponies47 by misstake
Gold_Demona, how does the stream handle motion?
Morning Ponies47
AdamTheDuck: D:
Phase4: It looks good. Nice and smooth here
hey i just got a qestion for all you a guy i know was talking about bronys and stuff so are girls classified as brony or pegisister
Except for the occasional buffer pauses, but that could just be my connection
anyoe here know how to preface a emial with a image?
i have no idea what they even mean by that.
therainbowvortex, either, whatever makes them confortable. Some prefer brony while others prefer pegasister
therainbowvortex: Depends on the girl. I'm a girl, and I call myself a Brony. I HATE the term "pegasister".
Gold_Demona, that might be my connection
therainbowvortex: But some girls like it and call themselves "pegasisters"
It's a matter of preference really.
can anyone help me :'(
Gold_Demona: i would agree with you bronies are about acepting and stuff i dont think we should relly seprtate members of th herd
Gold_Demona: and some others like to just be called "fans"
'pegasister' doesnt really roll off the tounge like brony does
therainbowvortex: Yeah, I see "brony" as gender neutral, so that's what I call myself. "pegasister" seems too narrow to me.
MadSurge: True, there's also those
PinkieSpice: What exactly is it you're trying to do?
I don't use very much brony, but I don't mind being called one :D
I tend to say that brony = ponyfags. Ponyfags would be the people who are active in the fandom and know more than the average fan. A fan would just be a person to watches and enjoys the show on TV or YouTube.
Brony = Pegasister.
Gold_Demona: recommend something to equestria daily, but it says to preface email with image, but I don't know what they mean by that
Gold_Demona: nor how to.
Dat sad music :(
ponyfags wait wait wait what hold up a sec what :O
/me Joining
The game :P
Ninjazz: ponyfag what do explain
?
???
Isn't there a better term for that than "ponyfags"? I don't really like the word "fag". O_o
by that definition, every artist and musician we have would be rendered a ponyfag
this is a good game
so yeah. stupid definiton
therainbowvortex, 4chan lingo. Fag being a term for a hardcore fan.
You can change fag into fan if you want.
that would be me
that'S not what fag was used for when i was on 4chan
untill they poped two ubers
nicely cordinated
well mabby not me
Gold_Demona: can you help me?
dependes
Oh well.
PinkieSpice: I think they just mean you should tell them what you're sending.
PinkieSpice: So they know what they're looking at.
hey yo i got team fortes the outher day and im a noob how do i join this game if i can
PinkieSpice: or IMAGE
ah
okay
hey im going to hit the hay
ok, Night therainbowvortex
but yay i made a new brony friend today
Night therainbowvortex
Why doesn't FTL want to work any more?...
Yeah. The 4channers use that f- suffix so much that most uses aren't even meant to be derogatory anymore.
Hence why I call myself a Rarifag.
Or "Rarifan".
hl2.exe has stopped working... AGAIN
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Ninjazz, lol
Ohai Kandarihu btw.
dat robot hand
Hmm, Phase4 what's the song?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHApVIdbEyo&feature=BFa&list=UUmMWwYyeQlZzbeynRJwCSGg

Hmm, it seems I like lots of waltz lol
I'm going to sleep now see ya guys later
Goodnight OneTrickPony

Gold_Demona: thank you
Phase4: The server your on hates me 3:
hl2.exe hates me Ponies47 :<
PinkieSpice: Anytime. =)
AdamTheDuck: My ping was over 200! D:
Gold_Demona: I hope they get it
AdamTheDuck: *Sadface*
PinkieSpice: Hoping they get it is one thing. Hoping they'll accept it and put it on the website is another. :P
hi everyone :)
Hiyo Lil_B =)
Hello Lil_B
Phase4: SEEMS LEGIT
Flamethrowing stop sign?
thanks Gold_Demona and AdamTheDuck :)
o
i'm done with that
Hey Lil_B
so is hl2.exe aparently
lol
dat hl2.exe
It is hating everyone today.
Phase4 hl2 crashes for me too everytime I exit TF2
hey Ponies47 :3
Lil_B: :3
Lil_B, i wasnt exiting though
just disconnecting
Phase4 oh :/
Ooh what's Phase4 playing now?~
Yay!~ Kerbals!
Ah Kerbals :3
dem Kerbals
Wee!~
Jetpacks, awesome :D
Phase4: Did they get there on the same ship or were they all put there separately? :D
damnit... Luminescence is already taken too as a music artist >.<
so these guys are trapped
Gold_Demona, one ship
i failed a rover landing
Haha, still looking for a new name Lil_B ? :D
Oops
you can see whats left down there
AdamTheDuck yeah :/
Lil_B: How about extending "lil" to "little"?
so
i'ma rescue these guys
Phase4: They are kings of the rock formation.
but to avoid having two missons, i'ma delete one
erbas was deleted
Gold_Demona yeah :/ but that again I don't really want to, or I would have called myself that in the first place
Lil_B: Ah, I see. Hmm....
another nice Variant would be B-saccharide that would be a derivate of my name and I could make up a Formula XD
soo the OCRemix Kickstarter for the FF VI Album is back again :) pledget 50$ immidietrly and I hope it reaches 45k soon :)
Wish I had that much dosh >.< Steam keeps stealing my wallet.
I haven't bought any games latly, mostly Hardware Stuff atm
but that Pledge was the last big thing for the next 2 month though -.-
I'm not sure they'll reach that goal, considering you can get the whole album on their website for free.
That's mostly why they didn't reach their goal the last time
AdamTheDuck: Same here, man. Steam sales are my bane. :<
Gold_Demona they did reach it... and went thy got closed by Squere Enix at 50k ... with a 20k already reached
Was that what happened?
Heh, goes to show how much I pay attention. :P
Hiyo XAX
that's me .-.
brb reconnecting so my auto command logs me in
Gold_Demona yeah, Sqare Enix wasnted to have a word with them :P They have sorted it out now, but Kickstarter couldn't restore the project
I see
Well, then forget what I said. Hope they reach their goal soon. :P
Gold_Demona and... they altready reached theeir gaol after 24 h XD
Ha!
currently 34k of a 30k goal XD
and 29 days left XD
Well then
I just want them to reach 45k, because that means I'll get a physical print of Voices of the Lifestream too :P
magnetically coupled rocket
I've only backed two kickstarters so far. One was a card game from one of the webcomics I read. And the other is a classic manga to be released in English.
Phase4 magnets work better when it'Äs cold :P
XD
Lil_B, also that encoding error

YUS! found a really good name Similar too Luminescence (which IS taken -.-) ... Fluorescence :)
That's a cool name. =)
^ Fluorescent Adolescent :3
Name for what?
MadSurge: For Lil_B
Wants to change name
and in a scientific perspectife, a FluorescenceIS a Luminescence :)
MadSurge, Lil_B's new name because Lil B is a singer's name or something
Lil_B: That it is
MadSurge found out Lil'B is already a known rapper -.-
Oh dear
Did stream die? :<
now for the slow transfer
AdamTheDuck, no?
/me hugs MC Lil_B.
oh nvm
aparently
MadSurge So I was searched for a new name , if possible chemistry releated :)
I'd love to change my name, but unfortunately, I've already established myself with THIS name. =/
You brokeded it Phase4 ? :<
it broke itself :<
I still have to go to school today and tomorrow but then on Friday I get to skip school and get to drive out to... CANTERLOT GARDENS (Why can't it be Friday now ;_;)!
Yay it's up again

pony*
Hey Kakumy
Hello Kakumy
but I'll sstay as Lil'B here on Bronystate, not much people think I'm the rtapper here XD
MadSurge: I could probably go by my pony's name, which is Whimsy Floof. :3
/me glomps Ninjazz really delayed
Besides, there's lots of Gargoyles fans :)
/me aged too much while waiting for Lil_B so he turned to dust as he was glomped.
Im doing this survey for my Math project can some of you answer?
what's the cutoff rating for an A movie? 7.5?
Gold_Demona: how did you come up with that? :D
/me falls into Ninjazz's Dust
Hello Ninjazz! :$
Cypresswolf, are we going by that system now? I thought it hasn't been decided yet.
and hi Kakumy
MadSurge: Days of brainstorming with my best friend on Skype. XD
Ohey, MadSurge. Don't breath me.
Guys just wondering it's for my Math project
this is slow
How long have you known MLP FiM
Ninjazz: no intention to get any lung diseases :D
Since April of 2011, Kakumy.
But I was a hater then.
Damn... I haven't been keeping track Kakumy :/
August*
MadSurge: Ended up with "Whimsy" cuz I like things of the whimsical nature. And "Floof" because my head's always in the floofy clouds. :P
:D
my first movie choice doesnt have a huge income from theatrical releases - mainly by distribution world wide
Kakumy about 13-14 month now
over 25+ years
Ninjazz: How many months is that?
MadSurge: I'm often said to have childish tastes, so Whimsy works with that as well. :D
Cypresswolf: I meant MLP FiM
Hey Everypony! :)
Kakumy, Since then? Probably around 13.
Gold_Demona: Ah yeah, they tell me that too :D
Kakumy: Don't we all :)
DAMNIT
missed
sick of missing the planet
I want to enter Metropolis into the Lottery, but can't insert it as an A-Movvie, it had the biggest budget at the time, but it released when the greatz depression it -.-
Now we get to watch past Phase4 miss again :D
its imposible to aim in this game
now for my B choice - shall I choose an eyesore or something worth wasting time for....
My husband and I have yet to get the hang of stearing the rocket to get it where we want. :P
So far we've only been able to shoot straight up and end up orbiting around the sun. XP
And maybe cross another planet's orbit
Ooh, pok?mon music
So few people answer gonna be damn hard :(
Kakumy: I've known about FiM for a couple of years now.
/me is sick :P
Kakumy: Didn't start watching it until last august though, right before Season 2 started.
Gold_Demona: So August 2011?
Goood morning, Bronystate! :)
Kakumy: Sounds about right. That's when I started actually watching the series.

Hiyo RandomArtist

Ohai RandomArtist
Depends on the favor :P
Gold_Demona: your husband has good taste in women :)
:) lotto sent - almost forgot I'm not eligible for another pony ep this month
it depends if i want to stop music making
i wated to summit some pieces to groups on da, but i thought it would be rude to just summit them and then leave
I reserve the right to refuse to do it. :P
can someone summit them for me?
MadSurge: More like I have good taste in men. Not many can put up with my eccentricity. :D
Can more people answer my question?
How long have you known MLP FiM? (It for my Math project :P)
this is soo slow
Gold_Demona: but eccentricity is what makes people awesome! :$
so can someone help me?
Since July '11. Started watching Xmas '11.
MadSurge: True, but my brand of eccentricity can be too much for some people. :$
no wait... there IS already an artist named Fluorescence -.- and he is making music :(
not really a brony
and its not like im a cloest brony.... >_>
RandomArtist: Ah, I see.
or anything >_>
Oh what's this?
Non-brony in the house?
RandomArtist, make second DA account?
Gold_Demona: ah, same for me :D I may look a little too stupid for someone out there :P
that kinda seems like a hasel and a waste....
having to create a email signing up, and then join to summit?
MadSurge: yeah, them weird people who think there's this thing called "normal". :D
MadSurge: Isn't that silly?
then to delete the account afterwards?
Morning ervery one ^^
Gold_Demona: "normal" people are an invention

Thank you for the bell Gold_Demona
:)
Hello. Anyone here?
Lil_B: I like it. =)
too slwo
slow
got bored
Gold_Demona: why keep it if i'm only going to use it once. I would be depriving the name from someone who wants it
Lil_B, how do you pronounce Reaktion? 6_9
should sleep
Night Phase4
Gold_Demona: and that would be mean
AdamTheDuck re-ac-tion
^^
RandomArtist: Then use a name nobody would use. :P
it's only 10pm Phase4.
not sleep yet
Sup guys, just came to drop by before leaving for School
Ninjazz, yeah, but i'm a little sleep deprived
Hello SpeedyBolt
hia SpeedyBolt
Phase4, same here. ^_^;
hi SpeedyBolt
Phase4, sleep is for the weak :|
Oh jeez, 5 minutes...
Phase4, sleep if you needs to, bro.
Well I got to be going later every one
Bye cow334
tf2 wont load
true
Goodbye cow334
Missing Reaction ... rolls of the tounge, doesn't sound bad, is chemistry releated :)
Bye cow...
im remixing the terminator theme why?
Phase4: Oh come on! Back to TF2? :p
Phase4: Possible maitenence?
RandomArtist: Maybe so it has more usefulness, you can make it as a PLZ account.
please account?
why am I suddenly so creative in names? I was searching for 1 week andf NOW I'm getting the best names in just a few minutes!
RandomArtist: Yeah, you know, those accounts that use the icon as a smiley emote.
I have 2 which i already forgotten the password and email used =_=
well, one acutally an icon, and another was for stamps
RandomArtist, may I ask why you made brony art if you don't consider yourself a brony?
i made them for my sister
since she loves the series
Ah ok
RandomArtist: That's cool of you. =)
RandomArtist: Sounds like a closet brony to me.
im not a cloest brony. >_>
My husband's a closet brony.
RandomArtist: Like saying "You were holding the drugs for your friend. Cause hes a drug user.
^^^
RandomArtist you are a nice brother for your sister :)
He's not a closet brony, he's a closet.
Again you have awesome husband Gold_Demona
Yes I do, DerpDash
Yes I do
darn it
very crappy name i can think of is taken
im actaully going to have to use a good name
Lol!
are you sure there no one in groups on da here?
You should totally use one (something)Dash or Rainbow(something) as your name. That's always creative.
I'm not. I don't make much pony art.
Well I'm off to bed early tonight... Got work early tomorrow :|
Goodnight everony :$
Only pony art I have is of my OC and a couple crossovers, so no group's gonna want it. :P
Godo night then AdamTheDuck :)
since i already have 3, im only going to do the other 3. >-.
Good luck rescuing those Kerbals Phase4 :P
good night AdamTheDuck :)
Cya AdamTheDuck!
AdamTheDuck, XD

AdamTheDuck: I wish I was you right now. I don't wanna go to school I wanna sleep -.-
Later AdamTheDuck
Kinda early, AdamTheDuck. But nacht.
AdamTheDuck: Later.
All the pings :3
/me feels wubbed
<3
YES
people on the ponyfortress server
:o
AND ITS NOT A CTF MAP : D
Phase4: I was wondering -lol
why would i want to use rainbow or dash when my regualar name already sounds like a pony name
=-=
Hmm?
Phase4: Would join you but gotta get ready soon :<
oh
tf2
taking its time
HI MOM!
ohai RandomArtist
i haven't play that in a while
I'd join, but I've never really played before, so I don't know how useful I'd be. 6_9
hello
laters all off to work!
Gold_Demona, you'd have to spend ages downloading stuff anyway
that reminds me. i need to see if i can trade my salavaged crate 40
for something on steam trade
Phase4: u seen terminator?
Phase4: I already have it up to date. I opened it up a couple days ago to explore the menus.
Gold_Demona: it's one of those games where you have fun even if you suck anyway :D
JRP, not in a while
heh
Ohai JRP
hi
Omegle... rofl
Gold_Demona: If you ever start it, use the soldier first
looks like im going with randomdash.... =-=
MadSurge: Soldier's the easiest?
Damn rarity is on it -lol
NewSuperBronyU: you there?
grap
crap
they block gurrila mail
i am actually going to have to create a email account
RandomArtist: Dont trade th eSalvaged crate just yet.
The crates numbers are on #48, so its going to stop dropping soon :P
RaveBrony: i didn't plan to, but im not spending money on a key
i thought it stop dropping already
Its already worth 10 keys xD it could doubelw hen it stops dropping xP
I heard it was 20 keys alreay
I'm like being retared on Omegle
I never understood the little TF2 exchange rate thing someone just made up I assume.
RandomArtist: The # 30 crate is worth 20 keys. # 40 is worth 10 :P
Welp time for school :<
Later everypony :<
Have fun, Ponies47!
RaveBrony: what is a number 2 crate worth?
later Ponies47
Later, Ponies47.
Why would someone trade like 20 dollars worth of keys for a crate you can randomly find in the game...
RaveBrony: or is it only crates with 0 at the end worth anything?
I HATE high school so much -_-
Can someone recommend me a Brony Website...
RandomArtist: Only the 'Salvaged' crates :P so yes, the ones with 0's
Kakumy: Everypony.com
Kakumy: Its a decent little forum site.
Kakumy: Its kinda on the RP side though. So yeah.
Is anyone else's Youtube screwing up??
Mega_Milk The reason why people pay in keys for crates like those is because you get a number of item drops per week, some don't even give you crates.
So people want to take the shortcut and buy one off someone who has one.
DashWithRainbows: But you can still find it randomly....
RaveBrony: my youtube okay
Mega_Milk Yes, but you are not guranteed to find one.
Mega_Milk: They only trade the large amount of keys for the super rare crate :P
*crates
DashWithRainbows: So impatience drives people to spend like 20 30 dollars on keys to trade for a box. That gives you ONE random item..
Basically, yes.
RaveBrony: Its still just seems so perfluious...
DashWithRainbows: -lol That system is broke yo.
Meh, I don't complain about it because I trade weapons and metal for stuff.
Omg rofl this is a damn epic Omegle chat :P
Mega_Milk: Salvaged crates are believed to have a higher Unusual drop chance. Aaand people want the stranges you get out of it. (You cant find stranges randomly)
DashWithRainbows: Thats what i do. Cause its a lot more cost effective. And its just easier to wait for me :3
ok, time to train some keyboard playing again ... and I'll start with... MOTHER 3 Love Theme T_T
RaveBrony: A strange is just a score board.
Aye, same here.
But I had to wait weeks to get a Machina.
is anyone else getting lag?
Soooo, you can buy a Salvaged 40 crate for 10 keys, open it, and get a strange item worth 14 keys.
I was on the verge of buying one until I got one in a drop.
I buy nothin in TF2
RaveBrony: It doesnt make the weapon better or anything. Its just a score board -lol Pointless
I've only paid for 2 keys.
Same
DashWithRainbows: -lol thats why I just go bargain hunting around in brony guilds.
$5 in Steam Wallet. spent it on 2 keys :D
DashWithRainbows: I have like 3 or 4 machinas
Screw the detonator, Demoknight all the way.
DashWithRainbows: If you would have asked me for one I would have been more than happy to give you one scott free -lol
I only like the Machina because I use a controller to play
So it's hard to get headshots, still manage to get a load of them.
Gah, that microphone is loud!
I cant play Demoknight to save my life! DemoMAN all the way! :D
Well, Mega_Milk, I didn't know at the time.
Besides, I used the time waiting to get better as a Spy.
how did i get the mp3 to be 25 mb?!?
O.o
DashWithRainbows: I know. Im just saiyan.
zero compression JRP?
no flstudio compresses them
Gold_Demona: your thinking of a wave file
JRP: Yeah, I know, but if you make an MP3 file with no compression, it gets huge in file size
JRP: Like a wav
and then my brain went to mush
Who's the guy who's talking through a blender? DX
Idk...
I think I can't ask my question in here anymore
Kakumy: What question?
why can't I hear or play this song without crying?
<3
fuck all my super metroid saves got wiped
Ugh, i keep buffering >.<
whos the guy who keeps screaming? :|
RaveBrony: I'm fairly certain its from phases end.
me too
Oh, ok
okay, i summited it
Gold_Demona: thanks for the help
RandomArtist: No problem. =)
Wow, I'm being a very helpful pony today. XP
:o
What happened? lol
Gold_Demona: i wonder if sleeping shy, gretel pie, and snow rarity will be accepted
I should stop. I might hit my "good deed" quota too soon.
you can never have a quota for good deeds
bad deeds on the other hand. >_>
RandomArtist: How true that is
Gold_Demona: would you like the see the pieces?
Sure
Link away

aaaaaand ded chat
D:
Ello there everybrony.
Why RandomArtist, pony art suits you well!
Hello Malavolent!
Is Wrek here?
too much fan art is a bad thing though
Not like in the chat, but actually here?
I don't want to get known only for my fanart
RandomArtist: My gallery is almost ALL fanart. :P
RandomArtist: I can has your DA link?
And of that almost all of it is OCs and crossovers.
I havent seen Wrek in forever.
night Phase4
needs more link
Like i said, its already like a pony name. =_=
I've seen Wrek off and on throughout the week, but he hasn't streamed in a while
Yay! ty
Malavolent: oringally it was a doodle on the edge of my notes
I wish my doodles were that cool. ._.
RandomArtist: Then you scanned it and finished in editor?
Malavolent: scanned it, gave it a textured background of watercolor paper
Malavolent: and i filled it in using the pen tool
Malavolent: it was before i got my tablet
That's pretty neat, for a doodle.
Phase4: y go to bed early now? and not before
Pen tool is awesome
most of my sketches start as doodles
but takes forever
"Current Residence: Florida".... you lucky bastard I miss Florida so much :'(
No wonder, they are all well done.
True
RaveBrony: you miss seveage beach water?
Have you been taking art classes or something?
RaveBrony: My husband wants us to LEAVE Florida. He hates it here. Where are you? Maybe we can trade places.
RandomArtist: Where do you live? O.o
Gold_Demona: hell no, i might not like the beaches, the nightlife, and the trafic
Gold_Demona: Lol! I live in New york now :D
but i love the weather
southern florida
RaveBrony: LOL, nvm. I don't wanna live there. XD
:D
RandomArtist: I live in Central Florida.
its a poplur travel destiation
Hop skip and a jump from Daytona Beach
near FIU
I live in UPSTATE NY, not NYC :D
Im in nobody town, ffs
heh
benben
Hubby wants to move to Indiana. That's where he calls home.
I wish I could visit the states someday.
Lol
Malavolent: Where do you live?
.... ugh
i drove up there once...
Or Ohio. Then we'd be closer to Cedar Point. lol XD
RaveBrony: Hear of the Europe.
its in the middle of nowhere
Heart*
Gotta ove that Europe
litterally between here and there in the middle of nowhere
*love
I have an uncle in Europe. He lives in Spain.
whos seen terminator?
RandomArtist: So the place is actually called "Nowhere"? Does Courage the Cowardly Dog live there?
XD
meh, nowhere more intresting than there
I'm always here, but never there.
I'm never ever anywhere.
Excepting here, 'cause here is where I'm in. :P
I'm mostly a indoor recluse. :U
Same here, RandomArtist
I avoid going outside like the plague.
i would spend some time, but my family smokes
Which is why I have cats, and not dogs. Cats don't require going outside.
someone is always smoking
and my doctor doesn't want me to even be near smoke
Only people that live in this house are me, my husband, and my two cats, and none of us smoke. :P
everyone but me smokes =_=
That sucks. :(
one member smoked, then another memeber picked it up, and then it spread to everyone
I had a dream I picked up smoking... Which is weird cuz I've never smoked in my life.
im still recoving from falling ill
this birthday someone gave me a horrible chestcold which left me with asthma
I don't smoke as well, and neither does anyone in the family.
I really don't get what is the fuss about.
What fuss?
Its gotten much better, but i still need my inhaler
ah
smoking is supposed to be claming
and they hook you with nitotien
accidtion
I'd rather use water pipe.
Much like alcohol.
Does anyone of you drink?
a water pipe?
Im 18....cant :(
I drink, but only on occasion.
I'm 18 and I can. :D
'Murica
And I had my first drink at 18. :P
You can drive from 16 but no alcohol until 21, is that right?
Right
Yep
Gold_Demona: did you see the piece spark?
And at 18 you get "adult privileges" like voting and gambling and stuff.
Gold_Demona: Yep, it's the same here.
meh
i don't bother voting
and you become legal too, but nowadays, thats pretty much pointless :D
^
Sick world we live in these days
RandomArtist: Yeah, that one's really pretty. =D
RandomArtist: Yeah, I don't bother voting either
Gold_Demona: that was a doodle. :U
As someone who lives in the US, what do you guys think about student loans?
/me is so jelly of RandomArtist. :<
How does it even work?
My REAL art isn't anywhere near this caliber, let alone my doodles. :<
art?
Student loans. - You are given money, so they can screw you with it later
Malavolent: Student loans work just like any other loan. The loan company gives you mony for the school, and when you're done with school, your payment period starts.
Gold_Demona: started as a doodle, but i worked on it for 3 days
What is the interest rate for the loans?
And how much do you usually get?
Malavolent: Depends on the company you go with
^
Average?
Malavolent: And also on how much you need
Oh, I see.
morning, everypony!
hoi Sylandest
Malavolent: I don't know the average. I just know mine's lower than normal at .2%
is there a stream?
twilight_sprinkle: Nope. No stream
Gold_Demona: You still have student loan?
ok
howdy twilight_sprinkle :)
Malavolent: Yup. I'm more than halfway through paying for mine.
Gold_Demona: If you don't mind me asking, how old are you?
Malavolent: The original principal amount was over $16k
Malavolent: I'm 28
And you're just halfwawy through? Damn.
Makes me glad the education here is basically free.
Malavolent: I've been paying on this thing for like 6 years now, and I'm down to like $6k
Oww.
ack, my mouth is going to be stuck like this at this rate
Malavolent: Yeah, it's pretty much like paying for a house or a car.
My parents had a college plan for me, so im set for the first 2 years
Except they can't take away the knowledge you got from the education.
Gold_Demona: And do you think it's a good or a bad thing, these loans?
Malavolent: They're good for people who can't get grants or scholarships.
I guess.
Malavolent: I had a grant, but it was a very small one and ran out very quickly.
Gold_Demona: How much do you pay for the loan monthly, if I can ask?
Malavolent: But then again, I went to an expensive school, so *shrug*
Malavolent: The bill is for like $120 a month, but I generally pay more to make the principal go down faster.
Sometimes up to $200
Pff, that's like a third of an avarage salary here.
But I guess your salary is pretty good, if you are able to pay the loan back.,
Lol
It's not very much. It's actually one of my cheaper bills.
Oh damn
Mortgage is the monster bill we work around every month.
Gold_Demona: You live in a flat?
Malavolent: Nope. A house
Gold_Demona: Rented house?
Malavolent: Nope. Bought.
So, the house loan, then?
Malavolent: Yup. Mortgage
Ah, I see.
When you rent, you pay rent. =)
When you buy, you pay mortgage
Oooohai Malavolent.
How much is it and how big is the house? Sorry for bugging you, but this just interests me too much :D
O_Ooohai Ninjazz :D
Malavolent: LOL, that's ok. I don't mind disclosing. XD
Malavolent: Our mortgage is actually higher than normal because we bought our house RIGHT before the house prices plummeted into oblivion.
Malavolent: We pay around $900 a month, but keep in mind that's WAY higher than what is normal nowadays.
Gold_Demona: Well, that's not very nice.
Malavolent: Especially for a two-bedroom one bathroom house
Not very big
And a fixer-upper at that
Brb, transfering into my currency
We owe more than a third of what the house is currently worth. :<
Well damn, that's a lot.
Yeah...
Basically an average salary here :D
It sucks, but at least we can still afford the payments
So this is the difference between the countries :D
Gold_Demona: If you're happy there, then it's okay, right?
Malavolent: Yup.
I try not to think about it. Thinking about it makes me a sad pony. :<
So I watch ponies instead. :D
That's good therapy :D
True dat
Lol
Still, having so many loans would make me stressed all the time.
We also have a car loan right now cuz we JUST bought a new car
It's a very very nice car too. I wubz it. :3
Malavolent: where do you live, if not a secret?
Gold_Demona: I guess both you and your husband work, right?
900$/month? Happy you are. I pay more for renting a flat here. :((
twilight_sprinkle: Europe, Czech Republic.
Malavolent: No, actually. My current occupation is Housewife.
ah k
Gold_Demona: And you can still manage to pay for all those loans? That's certainly impressive.
morning, all.
Hey WallDives
Malavolent: Yeah, we've been very fortunate.
Welcome to the world of tommorow, WallDives :D
Hiyo WallDives
Ohai WD.
Gold_Demona: Oh, good for you. :)
Malavolent, I fear as for what you mean. Also, buffer show. S4EP19?
lawl, reading random top votoed comments on an evangelion video "Indeed. I must say as far as Eva fans go, you definitely could be worse. Seriously, they tie with Bronies for most annoying fans in existence.". also i never realized how creepy and dark evangelion is
WallDives: Be afraid, be very afraid...
WallDives: Nono, it's S4Ep23
ah.
filler episodes. cant tell em apart.
twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, Eva's a weird one. It's definitely an acquired taste.
WallDives: yeah, I make that mistake all the time.
so...whats been going on in here?
o-o
Not a whole lot.
why am i still here again?
dunno.
lol)
We're so bored, we're asking each other the particulars of our lives. :P
I know why /I'M/ in here.
ohyeah, got distracted into showing my art and good conversation
wb, Dark_Horst.
Just today I've learned that my I could get to Norway via student exchange programm.
Want to meet Wrek for sure :3
WallDives: hi
if my grades were high enough, I could study in England or Luxemborg...but why would I do that?
Yeah, why would you want to come to England?
It's crap.
SNOW.
seeya
thanks for your help, and admiring my art. ^_^
See ya RandomArtist, keep up the awesome work!
05COFFEEEH
ohai Wrek.
Morning, Wrek. How's life treating you?
you said the magic word of the hour.
Wrek I'm surprised that you don't inject it into your bloodstream since you love it so much.
Although, I'd do the same.
05i got an XL thermocup
05filled with coffee
05it nice on cold authum days
08,01doo do doo
o-o
05casue irony
no stream?
08,01to confirm that i will not be causing anyone psychological damage with my project
08,01or physical damage
08,01or snooping on their private lives
???
/me is confused
08,01whcih are all irrelevant, because i'm not using human participants
08,01i'm just writing code
/me does a barrel roll in confusion
05hai Gold_Demona: whats for dinner? :3
Unless... you're one of those guys that people NEED you to sign stuff.
08,01Ninjazz: ethics forms are necessary, so that i don't flood the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin
Wrek: Tonight: Dunno. We ran out of meatloaf, so we'll be improvising our dinner until Friday when we do grocery shopping. :D
:O
KNEW IT. KNEW IT.
05nice
05im feeling like doign a wok or something tonight...
05hmm..
The meatloaf was a huge success btw. :D
Also, Wrek, nice coffee mug.
We've added it to my arsenal of Dinner recipes. :3
08,01Ninjazz: i actually do need to sign the form, just to confirm legally that the university isn't liable for any harm i do to anyone through porting a compiler to unix.
08,01RainbowCorpse: my code will be open sourced
08,01i'll probably use GPLv2
05:D
your*
Damnit.
05also i can try and dig up my recepie for tomato sauce, that works well with meatballs and pasta :3
08,01Ninjazz: well, ineed to sign a form saying that i don't *intend* my research to be harmful to anyone
05it has feta cheese so hmm
Wrek: Oh please do. We love pasta. =D
08,01then the ethics board review my project and confirm that writing compilers doesn't harm anyone
Wrek: The recipe we usually do involves red sause and alfredo sauce mixed together. Which is also very very yummy. :3
sauce*
Someone on Ponygoons dug up the old /co/ threads from the first episodes' runtime, they're a goldmine :D
05tend to use crushed peeled tomatoes
05some otehr shit
05etc
05spicing
compilers are slippery bastards. one moment they seem nice, but the next they betray you and your family
05so heh
Always make things so appetizing, Wrek.
MadSurge, oshit.
I can imagine.
Ooooohai twilight_sprinkl- HO SHIT NICE.

Only thing I have left to eat is spaghetti and turkey meatballs.
steak with boiled vegetables. veggies came out fine. steak had other plans
And breakfast meats like sausage and bacon

I offered the fire department the burned steak as an apology for coming down for nothing
since nothing caught flame and all
they did accept it?

They laughed, actually. I think it got me off the hook from any trouble when they did that. They did consider it though. XD

Gold_Demona: I thought that the best thing were the Heartless :D
I enjoy KH games
KH <3
I enjoyed KH2 more than KH1, but after that, the games got ridiculous with the Organization XIII backstory...
Or lack thereof
Gold_Demona: bleh, HYOOMANOIDS and less cute shadow monsters :(
yea, seems like the disney worlds are just in the way of the supposed plot
*shrug* They just felt like "more advanced" monsters to me. Fitting for a sequel, I think.
lol
What plot?
The supposed one
OH CRAP
I forgot my homework...
gasp :O
uh oh
sleepy =_=

Gold_Demona: the only Disney cool reference was the Chernabog boss :D
/me hits PinkieSpice with a tennis racket
Chernabog?

MadSurge: Funny, the Disney stuff was what drew me to the game to begin with

It's ponycreator
Obvious ponycreator pony is obvious
I made my OC in 2 programs
xD
:3
I used pony creator to come up with my color scheme, but that's about it.
i don't have a OC :(
I used the official one for the body and such, then I shopped some other things in
I have almost no artistic talent
I suck at drawing too
that's at least creative than just using pony creator
One sec
I'll link
i did it
http://i.imgur.com/L2ddn.png
Here we goe
nice there
I'm no artist though, so I can't really draw my own :L
Serenity : why does it have a gun?
Serenity same here
That's pretty cool Serenity.
Maid_RainBow: No real reason, other than the fact I have thousundz of guns in mah OCland
MadSurge, Oh I did a quiz on MLP on okcupid. I got this one choice of Pearly Pie, but I used Pearly.
Is he a good marksman?
Yeas

MadSurge: After that I looked for the series on Youtube, and watched the whole series in less than a week.
Well, All of season 1 anyway
Gold_Demona: I heard of their existence before, but I just sighed and said "Why Lauren, it's like fighting windmills"
That's what was there at the time
/me is popular? waves back.

..............
Then I discovered Bronystate and watched most of Season 2 on it. =D

Then just tea
Oh
Well, get some! :[
Or make somebody get some. :P
I have some iced tea, if that will work
tea with honey are nice...
I don't think iced tea counts...
I'm not much of a honey fan
honey is good for the throat though
neither am I
Soup is my personal go-to meal when I'm sick. Mmm. . . Just thinking about it is making me hungry for some right now.
Soup is very nice
Everlasting_Joy: your making me want soup damnit!

Lul 21 drinking age
ofna01: ... Struggling to see what age has to do with it...
Sucks to be you
I was gonna say "No one has to know, ofna01. We won't tell." :P
lol
I'll probably never drink anyways
Who doesn't drink at parties?
I can never drink..
I don't want to end up looking like a drunk idiot. :P
i dranks whiskey befor that shit was hot stuff in my mouth
dabi pls
ofna01: That only happens if you drink to much
actaully I cant drink Alcohol at all..
jaymoo pls
<3
too*
well i dranked once
i no see u in ayjes jaymoo
<3
I drink on occasion. Usually rum+soda or whiskey+soda
Only the left side of my throat hurts :(
i now right
i was laughing so hard dude when i dranked that whiskey shit
fuck the police. we drink!!!!
/me yawns
I could d with some soup, that always helps my throat.
I'll go see if i even have any xD
ok doki loki
soup is good =)
I don't drink because I'm underage until January 18th
I drank while legally underage. :P
Well, all we have is tomato soup.
thanks goodness I dont drink
>implying legal age to buy alcohol is same as legal drinking age
Tomato soup is too, i guess you could call it Sweet, for me.
>can legally drink from age of about 3 in private property with parental superivision
My first drink was a Kalua Mudslide
Use > again and I'll slap you dabi.
;D
o;
My first LEGAL drink was Ice101 :D
Ugh
Dilemma, do i make a sandwich or a hot pocket....
Here in the U.S. legal drinking age and legal purchase age are the same thing
Hot Sandwich Pocket.
easy hot pocket
Sucks to be you then
:P
Not for me. I'm 28. XD
Hot Pocket sounds good.
/me wonders if he has supreme hot pockets in the freezer
Wrap the hot pocket in the delicious deli meat.
and cover that in bread.
Ok, a decade ago it sucked to be you, now I suppose it's quite good to be you
:P
Lemme go check, brb
ofna01: Well you could also have a regular sandwhich and just stick the bread in the toaster and bake/toast it
Such an annoying pom dabi.
Jokes on him, I stole all his hot pockets.
That's what I'm doing right now
I can't help it. ;________________________;
tsk tsk
/me runs in and kicks Barb in the shin
I HEARD THAT!
Well, no hot pockets either, but i found some hot dogs...
Spiderman? :D
ofna01: Well, despite how much that hurt I still had some hot pockets and I also get the satisfaction of seeing the pety act that that was.
Hey everypony
