00,10well you get a tast of it with fluttershy
/me is poked
Twilight really should have thought that riddle out more
hi
ive been here the whole time lol
This is just great :D
omg its not like we can get guards to help
00,10his expresions are great
^
That reused heroic/friendship music
poor fluttershy
i thought it wasnt
since it goes away
after theyre done
never knew about the labyrinth before the episode
00,10it's like wimsical yet mennacing
/me quit *mwah* Goodnight everybody
whoops
night Dken, dream of ponies tonight :)
I like ponies
me too <3
00,10ew ponies
cool NoccturnalBlade
*butter
00,10mare do well ep
hey all.
00,10will have to check
them balloons
do want :3
:D I like this episode! It has accessibility for everyone! :D
its been a slow day here
i think we do
hi alla you :>
oh wait or maybe that was the theory about their eyes matching
<_<
>_>
i cant help but thing "ponies, the anthology 2" when i see this scene
is this like accessiblity recognition episode or something? :>
bleh i have a terrible memory for these things
00,10discord breaks all walls
my fav pony <3 :)
Fluttershy counter trolls
ew fluttershy, go pls
supa dooper creepy music
and best discorded character coming right up
00,10ahhhhh
lol
bam-evil
Dusk's Dawn lacked a lot of that
00,10cause they put no work in to the foly
I always liked the music clip when they were discorded.
even the BG pictures themself
thats quite the subject
dat tail whip
00,10they admit they rushed it too
yeah :/
00,10we watched it earlyer tonight
00,10it was painful
Ill give credit to Project Interlude for the attempt
once you get passed the bad voice acting and detalization, its tolerable, the story seems pretty interesting
It's not
care package on the way
They rushed it to STEAL that title
i cannot believe i went there o.o
RD broke da rulez
00,10yeah problem is I would say it's not compleet
suddenly end theme
rather, released
00,10we are jerks =p
the nurses VA is hilariously unfitting
in a way, we all are
I'm back now
Read Background Pony
Good night
it was okish..
Whoops
i gave it a like for effort, but yeah, it was rushed and loks like it was done just to claim the title of first fanmade ep which isnt cool
oh haha
poor her.....
00,10I dont but I can ask if otheres do.
http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=261112433429
dusks dawn story was somewhat interesting
hahaha sure :P
Oh.
okai
00,10hold on.
dabi plssss
Night Midn- damn it :(
...wow
This is...amazing
Now this is how it should be done
00,10exactly
Even shorter animations like Childern of The Night do it right
I honestly couldn't care about the "first" title, as long as it's done very well.
http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=130761801296
defines the ponies
^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
00,10cause thes guys are taking time to get people on the team to do it right
http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=230865673698
Wait, isnt it already fall?
oh yes :)
it is.
animation alone wont suffice though
they shouldve joined forces
haha nice
thats always the way to g
*go
O////o;;....
ouch
Insect intake/
economically speaking
They really cant claim first fan-made episode anymore
derpy :D~!!!
But they don't NEED to, IMO.
hiya guys
Is it REALLY necessary to have that title?
well I had a huge scare
yeah well I managed to get it running by logging into my guest account
ik, just found out today :(
:D
00,10his early work
The bees
aw-awwwww
this is his early work? hot damn

They have the same style: pony creator vectors :p

00,10ok back to the ep
Goddamit my heart!

00,10most of it was puled edited and croped bits from the show
00,10aye
Yes 2 ponies
Either that or his own episode.
still, although it doesnt take as much talent, it sure was an effect method. perhaps they should use it more often

ooo simpsons
have you any idea how much work those do
PedoMoustache
noo- never thouht about it
it runs several hundred regex for some reason
o.O
yeah, i dont get it either
You could probably simplify it tons without getting more inaccurate-
oh ralph

I'm not too familiar with timing, yet, but setInterval does the counting- but- I can't imagine it needing much more than that, and data

damn cocaine wife
uh murdered
his wife shot him while high, I think
or stabbed him-
Dammit Homer
latter
Apparently she was clean, but some dirtbag hollywood dude got her back into it
i know the wife did it but not how
This is us 15 years from now
or--actually, already happened
...she is just a VA
2,14 treat our VAs well, please don't harass them
Homer..that hurt
burn
why would VAs know about how to beat the videogame
yeah, va's get asked craazy questions by nerds
dat cosplayer
Yeah, but- once we age as a fandom, we'll get trekkie grade nerds, I'm sure
<,<

2,14 we're getting close -_
2,14 -_-*

I like talking ad length about--lore implications by episodes, I'm pretty sure that's half trekkie
hey the kids wanted extreme
Oh brain
I have told that to someone
...yet...
Hehe, this is Simpson's writers response to Simpsons fans
Jayson Thiessen
oh ok
Showrunner and producer
theres tabitha fanfiction?
Tabitha got FoE book as a gift
2,14 they sent her the fully printed volume of FoE to Tabitha
....
Oh, the finfic prints
why
2,14 because yeah, the VAs in the show want to see how we bastardize their hard work
i heard about that a while ago
For fun, I guess
FoE?
That was based on eh..that dude..
those lousey writers
I mean F:E might be decent and all but still.....
Screw Haxe, Screw C#, Screw HTML5.
Of course, but it's not like it was sent by anyone involved in the printing
:(
I CAN MAKE IT
2,14 Doesn't excuse it
Time to work overtime on Vector to Sprite. -.-
i have to go now, my planet needs me
BEST THING EVER
XD
2,14 because it was on behalf of the fandom, regardless of whether you did it or not, someone is representing YOU in that way
No, I don't feel represented by the actions of others-
i have to go now my planet needs me
Dat "YOU" :<
No, of course not, but she has a choise not to read it, and she probably won't
2,14 it doesn't matter if she reads it, the point is that we SENT it to her in the first place
Chances are she'll be gardening instead
I don't really see why that matters to anyone
subject change?
I hardly think any of the VA's care
I HEAR MITTENNACHT! <3

<--- Also that load
can I put in a request for the next episode after this one?
AOL still in business?
everyone dies
ok that's impossible
it lives
ahaha
Compared to anyone else
And funnily, they are complaining the most. :P
ikr
2,14 not having to pay exporting costs goes a long way
Food, instruments, cars- houses--
2,14 most of those companies are based in US
no aparent reason
the price of games doesn't translate at all
In USA it costs...
(If you compare the 699 to Dollars)
they get the US $ price and just apply it to other currency without converting it
104,27 Dollar
2,14 Which I have no idea how much that's worth in $
Do you PAY that much for RE6?
2,14 to be fair
Discombobulator
2,14 a lot of european countries have rediculous gaming regulations
And in Australia, 699 SEK is 101,94 Aus
but it's not just games
dat pin pals
it's most things
ahahah
^
oof
continuity nod
Watta joke
and that fact that they can get away with it
palpate for TIC :3
a lot of games get released at 120AUD
Anyway, next time I see someone complain about EXPENSIVE games, I'll slap 'em .:P
rawr~
But next time... *SLAP* the spoiled people =P
ahaha
hes a homosexual :D
This episode had 2 pages of Do not refer to, and not suitable for broadcasting
when Fox changed managemenet, it got a one page note that said "Suitable for broadcasting."

IUNO
The developers of War Z are a POS
Ehh...
:))
And they've lied about their history.
They say they have worked on several games, but there is no proof.
though... all the applejack fanart ive done was of suggestive material....
Emotion is good, suggestive is emotion in some form
I regret funding them.
oof!
Why is there a store to buy items in War Z? .-.
I have a princest drawing I should finish, but I hate colouring soo..much

Rarity was my first though
She's everyones first..
Or right to some people.
Hehe, I think my first fav pony was Fluttershy
now its Fluttershy Rarity and Pinkie in a mix-
her
Fluttershy has never been favorite pony for me
watever
/me loved Rarity before it was cool.
I just don't buy into her cuteness for some reason
Shy girls turn me off I guess.
I can see that-
>_>
yeah, everyones different in that, I more relate to her than attract to her I guess
I dated someone like fluttershy... only thing good about it was... well... nvm
You all like ponies
Gaaay
or don't know how to get back home
Rofl
You have no proof
Thanks <3
Could be
!

nuh!
FUK IT
but I am pretty sure if I got stuck in a room with an obnoxious girl (RD) I probably would like fluttershy more
but, Shy is not the same as anxiety issues
Oh great.
Coffee on my pants
my girlfriend reminds me of fluttershy sometimes its really cute :)
Sorry I just.
Yeah
wut.

That would be annoying to me
Shy girlfriend ruined it for me
