Xaiden: I LOVE Double Dash.
My first games were Sonic the Hedgehog and Altered Beast on Genesis :)
My first games were those on Atari 2600
00,10the best example right there
Aww... Poor Teller...
SirGanjalf no its a guy who looks like him and sometimes does parodies
Shizuka: I played Myst, Doom, Quake, Redneck Rampage, etc but watching Beavis & Butthead crossed the line - talk about your mixed messages :P
did you guys see the new releases clip from season 3?
released*
My First game Was Mario 64 :3

Wait sorry MadSurge, never mind, got it, thanks!
donutpop365: that's "delle"

Nal stop right there
i love playing NewSuperBronyU
Nal No S3 spoilers
or youll get permabanned
11,02o////o
hes the best game :3
NewSuperBronyU: Its true i've been jumping on turtle and picking up coins and eating mushrooms to throw fire balls ;^; All because of mario.
AJIsAwesome: My bro and I beat that on the hardest difficulty, first try.
oh
Nal would love to talk about it, but we kinda can't here
Silver_Soother: I am! I talk with my students about sports and video games pretty regularly, actually.
Lyra`: MMmmm, can I watch you play NewSuperBronyU ?
FEAR!!!!!!!!
Sumica: Actually... I can
Sumica: Jack Thompson logic aniki...
Nal But yes we had a EQD drop of it. But avoid talking about it
05HOLD IT RIGHT THERE Nal!
05no spoilers in this room
I hope they don't show just shooters
<---- Was in the army for 10 months, and no trouble with shooting gun(Heck I was good with it)
yes you may, but its a single player game, so only i get to play him ;3
.....WAT
:D
00,10yes but did the game teach you Vordox?
Sumica: Yes
dat math
oh okay, fair enough. i don't know how you guys can hold yourself from watching it. O,o
65%? Why, that's almost half!
Xaiden: My brother and I LOVED the Co-op. We would play from sunup to sundown.
irl tennis is way mpre fun than wii tennis though, although its less accessible ofc
... You're not supposed to seel mature games to kids in the first place... right?
Sumica: The only issue I had was the damn blinking
this is just like back in the 80's when people thought rock was making kids become psycopaths
CriticKitten: That's awesome. I had one teacher that made movie quotes ALL the time. (Even let us watch movies and play games in his Study Hall.) How he manged that, I dunno, but it was AMAZING. Lol.
GilDash: Heh... YEAH
05Nal im 100% spoiler free
05both season
Nal Some just like the fresh feel and getting things as they watch it instead of hyping themselfs
052 and 3
Silver_Soother: That is AWESOME.
Nal quite alot of us can
00,10jack seems to have a fucking thing for fish
its easy
051 was out when i became a brony so meh
lol
if it becomes law, the parents are just going to buy it for the kids.
"What can change a nature of a man?"
i could never do it even if I wanted to. xD
Lyra`: true
AJIsAwesome: Mario Kart Co-op is best co-op
Shooting people ISN'T Fun
Dat neckbeard
13oh just say it dude
well to bad shotting people is fun
13they're EEEEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIL
Xaiden: YES IT IS.
EVIL?
But hopefully Dead SPace 3 will beat it ^^
I'm guilty of overfeeding my fish... learnt before it was too late though. ^_^
AJIsAwesome: That teacher actually got me into Adam Sandler movies, which lead me to get into legit GOOD movies. He really shaped me into the person I am right now.
Gunthler|Offline, sry, was distracted
Shizuka: ... Play Spec Ops the Line. DO IT
I have a neckbeard when I get a week off work :3
ohh now I remember why I left this site for some time spoiler warnings
EEEEEEEEEVVVVIIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!
05oh look
Sumica: he's a porpus poker
05combat arms
That guy looks like he's a victim of the Fast Food episode we watched earlier
05what a buggy piece of shit
MadSurge: Haha, doing Rosettastone and it goes "un bambino", so I click the boy and it plays the noise that it plays when you're wrong. Oops, that was a girl :P. They should at least give the kid longer-ish hair. :P
I remember a few times my Grandma came to visit while in the middle of a game of GTA - my how she laughed about how naughty I was running people over :)
oh wow, going to a video game convention to ban video games, that mustve ended well
it taught me how to kill.
But 3rd person shooters are OK?
Wrek: You mean hacked PoS
i'm not shooting people, i'm shooting fucking HEAPS OF DATA, FORMED INTO BIPEDAL POLYGONS!
what what was that one?
CriticKitten: HES PETA
indeed they can be dangerous. most of them show that guns have no recoil
just saying, im desensitized.
13Vordox: heard about that, heard it has serious gutpunches throughout
looked sorta like bulletstorm
i'm calling bullshit already
hot damn this fucker is more twisted than a Bramble Blast level and heavier than the choices in the walking dead
00,10.....
00,10wut
oh yeah, i'm sure they dont realize that
Shizuka: If doom is wrong. I dont want to be right.
Xaiden: Quick, throw digital blood on him!
13[18:24] [@Shizuka] http://imgur.com/a/Zqy8U#0 i'd argue video games can develop some skill in real world applications
oh sure, because handeling a real weapon is just as esasy as it is in COD
thats whhy you get head shots, jack.
SCREW YOU JACK THOMPSON !
00,10so he thinks people go shooting up schools for points?
Oh Jackie, you funny guy.
Shizuka: doubtful tbh
and all COD players are weapon pros
Shizuka: It has... I'm not an FPS fan, but I LOVED it for what it TOLD me.. Something I have known for a long time, but Yager(The creators) did this risk... ANd HOLY SHIT did it resonance.
13look at the pictures
donutpop365: "un bambino" means "a (male) child"
Sumica: i think Jack Thompson was molested by an NES when he was little or something along those lines
Shizuka: and?
13that's me having never held anything shaped like a rifle, and getting that kind of accuracy
CriticKitten: ITS OUR FORM OF HOLY WATER! DESTROY THE ANTI-VIDEOGAME BEASTS OF HELL
Yeah, I screwed up, I thought picture of the kid was a female child.
how far away, babe?
Shizuka: But you play A Pyro. :P
00,10Bronysith, he fell on a joystick
Failure to Kinect
GILF?
GILF

GILF= Grandma I'd like to HONK.
Conyst: Common problem, given how buggy and shit the Kinect is.
xbox live bitch
Shizuka that's pretty damn good, wish I could find a shooting range around here.
13twilight_sprinkle: excel doesn't exactly build hand eye coordination
Oh lovely...
Sumica: no no no... his family was murdered by the NES duck hunt gun
13DashWithRainbows: was at the state fair last month

13Dark_Horst: BBs i think, air powered
YOU LIE
Give us the Triforce. We wants it.
twilight_sprinkle: EVIL?
can we not see the fat guys crotch
13so not much recoil but still
EEEEEEEEVVVVIIIIILLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!
Sumica: The belly crotch? Or the spread eagle he's pulling?
you know, this guy reminds me of the moon from majora's mask
Shizuka: thta's the thing. these arent hard to ahndle^^
twilight_sprinkle: Eh, Excel is fine, once you tell it to stop helping you.
phew, good that i didn't have social skills before i started paly video games
AJIsAwesome: EXCEEEEE--I MEAN EVIIIIIIIIIL

Great, now he's going to say that video game addiction is genetic
13yay mass killing simulator
Shizuka: DOOM ftw
Lolwut
I FIT IN TO ALL THREE! HOW MANY POINTS DO I RECIEVE?!?!
GilDash: sometimes it messes something up and you dont even notice, and you have to repaste the whole thing to get it working again
Explain the stuff before videogames then.
00,10plany medic then
this fat guy mustve been trash talked to on CoD :D

Sooo... Gears of War are okay then?
Sumica: Esxactly :D
thats called fallout 3 medical skill.
Sumica shoot needles insteafd
I have a triangle I just made off the top of my head. It's got "stupid asshats" on all three branches, and your picture is one of them. :D
that would be no fun
just saying
Shizuka: Mass killing simulator, IS BEST SIMULATOR
00,10magic gun that heals
13but medic has the needler
school shottings have happened before video games so the triangle doesnt make fucking sense
So instead of a gun you go around finding a hobo and hitting them with a big stick?
Shizuka /)
exactly
11,01Where's the "Social rejection" side?
Sumica: Borderlands has that.
DEFCON - the real true MASS killing simulator
twilight_sprinkle: I know. I work with it every single day. Missing queries with no warning is a particular 'favourite' of mine... -_-
13i think i actually had a 0.4 kdr with medic, not even counting the massive assists you pile up
:o
Sumica: but as a perk :D
Nittany_Discord: or bullied viciously?

13yeah but BLUE BUCKETS ARE ONLY FOR PAPER
13THEREFORE GAMES CAUSE VIOLENCE
cachi01: True, but still.
Eli: Skinner's Method is the "You push, you gain".
Shizuka: Nah, every child needs a little scarring.
i did lan parties with classmates in high school during turbo pascal class :D
Shizuka you need to steal that lunch from that guy without anyone noticing
Vordox: what do you gain?
13TheGreatAndPowerfulT: moar liek "clear the level without being detected"
00,10the twinkie killer
13at least with how my social life was..
My God. Toothpaste causes shootings.
Eli: You push mouse button(Simple), you MAY hit a kill, You gain points/Progression
mmm twinkies
Men!!

TOOTHPSTE CAUSES SCHOOL SHOTTINGS
My friend plays Halo 1 lan partys in the middle of class since it's a computing class
13dammit men you're ruining everything
How long has science known?!?!
Sumica: The worst killer.
RaveBrony: Screw your misandry
oh wait 've done LAN parties!!!! in my technology class my friends and i played counter strike 1.6 every class =D YAAY
11,01Sorry Shizuka. :<
Eli: There's MORE to it though.
I was wondering why the opening implied that Vaccines were Bullshit
sorry Shizuka
Holy shit, having a pair of balls makes you a murderer! >_>
Shizuka: Sorry. :(
Vordox: enlighten me
TOOTHPASTE IS EVIL IT CAUSES SCHOOL SHOTTINGS
/me is male and now feels bad
^
yeah id say video games actually relieve people of their murderous desires, that seems to be how it is for many peole
sorry shizu
dat Sonic Riders shirt :D
Shizuka I am not sorry
Shizuka: end us all please :(
Xaiden: those were the times
SirGanjalf inb4 some of them are neutered
TOOTHPASTE IS EVIL
I'm sorry Shizuka
Shizuka: sorry :(
00,10I figured it out, every viloent killing they all have one thing in commen.
And then all the males apologized
violent video games taught me that if you try to kill everyone, youre probably going to get killed by some camping bitch.
RaveBrony: Well go shoot up a school.
00,10they all have blood
I take pleasure of ruining things
Eli: But too much to take into right now, I'm still slightly confused on why FPS is such a attentive game.
13you know... i want to see the violent video game argument like, ten years from now, and i want someone to bring up minecraft as an example
00,10blood leaded to killing
huh?
HEADSHOT
MLG
13i want to see the effects of minecraft on violence :3
Pfft
Yes.
Yeah :D
Shizuka depends
Minecraft is best violent video game
if its a MP game
Shizuka: YES PLEASE :D
/me fluffs ASoftFluffyThing
i expect violance to go up
Shizuka: you go punchin innocent porks
11,01I can't wait when we laugh at the war on piracy.
Online Gameplay BITCH
Minecraft brings out the worst killers.
Eli: It depends completely on the reason you play, from either the social aspect, the game aspect, or the player themselves and their experience on the relationt o the aestethics.
Dat Sonic Riders Shirt
Well, pick-axe kills have increased
Hehehe
Shizuka: you go punching innocent trees
/me nuzzles Jmo
me and a faltmate use to argue ALOT because of minecrraft
:>
Friendship!!
thow that use blocks of dirt.
Shizuka: "I attacked a tree yesterday for wood, with my BARE HANDS"
Violence going up? My god, it's almost like there's more people in the world or something
fucker kept griefing me
<3
Then explain Skyrim...
cachi01: THOSE INNOCENT TREES!
those*
Shizuka: you go grief everyones house
13Chrysalis: "a report released today shows a causal link between the game Minecraft and childhood violence, citing multiplayer construction as the primary motivator"
Look at that kid, he waggles BACK and forth, so eager to shot
Skyrim just causes you to go shouting :D
><
Shizu: LOL
Shizuka: Minecraft promotes violence against ecosystem. Strange PETA still didn't protested it, though.
13nice shot
<--- See that Sumica?
skyrim.....Y CANT I KILL CHILDREN? FUUUUUUUUUUU
Pro
games are good common ground, although i actually know a guy who doesnt liek any games
welp. i don't like it. and yeah, maybe it's because my best friend doesn't game either. but i don't even play with my brothers
Wow, he didn't nerd out like every other CoD fan, He's certainly different from the rest
Deliverance? Harrison? :O DEAR GOD THEYRE GONNA RAPE INDIE
that last one really hit home
00,10yeah

COOL!
Do it!

HOLY LAWSUIT
He's swaying!
13and his mom is right there
MLG AIMBOT HAX
Meh, i can't 360noscope:|
/me I used to wonder what friendship would be, then a violent video game showed me~
He must be crazy!
and the police
Alright kid your on TV show them that mad headshot skill!
thats kinda dangerous..
13he is the eggman
DAMNIT PENN
hes gonna get supprised at the weight
LOL
"Don't shoot! We're going back to the convention."
13dude, face it, you're a sphere
guns are pretty damn heavy
lol
HA :D
Looks more like the Walrus to me, Shizuka.
00,10hahahah
ha
If only Scoot-Scootaloo was here for this
Chrysalis: Yeah, but the simulation in the game is the trigger, that's what they are used to.
ahaha
11,01XD
snooPING AS usual, I see~
:D
dat rock band
Nice :D
:D
WHAT?!
....he just got counter-flier
hella sick
13what kind of posture is that..
...
WHAAAT?!
Animal Crossing has made the psychopath I am today
WHAT THE UCK!?
Day fucking hypocrite
LOL
Hypocrite
WTF
ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Shizuka: It's VERY good position, heck one of the best.
WTFFFFFFFFFFFFF
"I love guns O_O"
05oh look its sumi's model
00,10he's like a weebal
>: O
wwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
You hypocrite. :S
Shizuka: That gut has to cut the recoil in half.
-10000000000000000 points in humanity faith lost
FUCK ME? LOL
I am laughing so loud right now.
hyprocrites everywhere
jesus...
WTTTTfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
What the fucking fuck fuck me ..... nice
oh calm the fuck down, caht. its clear they put much effort into finding these people
what the fucking fuck
Bronysith: Agreed.
00,10heh
HYPOCRITES EVERYWHERE EVERYWHERE!?!?!??!??!?!?
God damn, haha
*chat
what the fuck
13maybe not so much for him but i'd think you'd need to lean forward
Tovler: animal crossing. best 2 years of my life lol
HYPOCRITE
hyporcite
twilight_sprinkle: SO MUCH effort.
00,10love that gun
g36 with b mag niiice
13else recoil would put you on your back
Oh GOD
Who needs FPS when you have an entire armory:D
/me is loving that shotgun
HYPOCRITE MUCH??????
hypocrite
LOL
Hahaha
spas12
To be honest I don't play that many FPSes outside of Goldeneye and the Metroid Prime games
hell, they might even be actors
11,01Hope no-one's holding that camera.
that guy has a nice collection
HES PYRO
He seems like a pretty stable guy.
RUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
though needs some binary
Animal Crossing has the best fandom
that could have ended badly
11,01Or he's committing a major gun safety violation.
Shizuka: Believe it or not, it's an aiming position, not a bursting position :P
Tovler: What the fuck is animal crossing?
Lol
Tovler: i think the MLP fandom is bigger
I prefer fantasy games like Mario, Sonic, Mega Man, Zelda, Kingdom Hearts, etc
Shizuka: his stances were horrible, the only reason he wasnt knocked off his ass from recoil is cause hes a fatty
Nittany_Discord: It was probably on a stand.
did i hear kingdom hearts?
/me slaps Xaiden
total bs
Increased blood flow = behavior
cachi01: he was saying best...not biggest...dumbfuck
Spectrum_Rush: No he's not...
Shoot the dead body! :D
doom 3?
Only dark games I've done are Mortal Kombat, Lollipop Chainsaw, and Darksiders
^
Damnit guys, it's about the angle of the body and the bone structure. ._.
11,01Yep.
Vordox: :|
/me is on an Animal Crossing nostalgia trip
11,01Research should be unbiases.
Lollipop chainsaw sucked,
11,01*unbiased
the gun has huge recoil, he could get hurt
Bronysith: go fak urself u know i suck at talking!
I always use non-lethal when I can , your argument is crap
Nittany_Discord: this show is extremely biased though
00,10hahah
HA
Only plyed it for Tara Strong
what
:D
13ron jeremy? headshot dat
RON JEREMY
wut?
:D
LOL
-lol XD
Nittany_Discord: unfortunetely, all research HAS to be biased
11,01twilight_sprinkle: True.
Shizuka: :D
oh god xDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
heh
Kid,
KID
13um
00,10uhhhh

Shizuka which one? :D
SHOULDER
this kid is gonna hurt himself
totally safe
wtf @ giant gun
"Where is the scope."?
Shoulder!!
LAwl
"Where is the scope?"*
00,10just punched em in the face
that kids gonna take his shoulder out
Dat Powder taste
you might wanna prop that stck against your shoulder, kid
oh nice, he Did hurt himself
Shizuka: He deserves to get headshot after all of the headshots hes given. >_>
idiots
NOOOOOOB
13baaaad pun
how is his shoulder nto dislocated
He just wrecked himself O_o
lol
Ha
13the recoil went up into his ear
his poor shoulder
yeah he took the recoil to the face
DashWithRainbows: why can't I call an airstrike?
Jack Thompson needs to die
MadSurge must be an EMP
he shouldnt have been allowed to do that
00,10he learned guns are fucking hard
ASoftFluffyThing: -lol! no :3
Damn noob tubers
getting high streaks
13with that sandbag there he should have used that for support
13and the shoulder
Wait til you fire a 30/30 or a .12 gauge, then he'll really know how it feels to fire a gun
Mega_Milk lolwhynot
i totally agree to twilight-sprinkle
It also hit his face.
11,01He probably didn't hit anything with that failure.
00,10he hit ground
Looked like it
MadSurge Too bad I done the same :>
ASoftFluffyThing: He flinched like a kitteh to a spray bottle at just the noise.
look at dat duke spinning around
MW2 trolling was an all time favourite of mine.
00,10he had the gun aimed so low the shot probably bounced off the ground
13yeah the barrel swung low, that'd hit ground
Ohh
Parents, informing themselves? MY GOD
At least he didn't shoot his eye out.
DashWithRainbows: I tried COD multiplayer, I prefer TF2 :D
MLG on a Mac
13school video game teams...
13FUND IT NOW
^
11,01Well, the recoil destroyed his aim anyway.
^
twilight_sprinkle: Oh come on, there was a police officer there.
no
emmm what the fuck is happening
^^^^
VGHS?
^^^^^^^^^^{
Shizuka: I agree! :D
SirGanjalf: he couldve hurt himself pretty badly
Shizuka: I support that idea!
<--- Have fun with truth.
Nittany_Discord: almost destroyed his jaw
00,10perspective
13and yep
SirGanjalf: i wasnt worried about someone getting shot
Shizuka: my school has started that...slowly
yeah sports were a bitch....
o-o
13the football argument destroys the video game complaint
dat perspective
o.o
yea fuck football
But I like football
13i can't imagine baseball is much better
CONFOUND FOOTBALL
"BUT THEY GET EXERCISE" STFU
Tennis is best sport
Fuq Sports
AVS619: SPEAK THE TRUTH BROTHA
i like that show what its name?
00,10big woop penn I have died atleast that much in PS2 already
*wasn't
you knoe it
you get it? playing any madden game is bad and you should feel bad
Shizuka: better play european football, aka soccer :D
SirGanjalf: he hit himself as it is :\
*know
I took some light spinal damage and a broken leg playing football. And I got several twisted ankels from basket ball.
13and now for the gut punch
13and the best damn mom ever
Shizuka: makes me sad....
ASoftFluffyThing: See.
MadSurge: a.k.a real football
.... ;_;
T-T
poor kid
ASoftFluffyThing: Sensitive.
SCREW YOU JACK !
Poor kid
poor kid
Evidence enough, world?
Mega_Milk: i got kicked in the balls soooo many times playing football
what did he kill
oh.... that part?
wait, he crying because the recoil hurt him or what?
they said sorry.
Manly tears was shed
poor kid
so its okay.
Mega_Milk: soccer i mean
00,10guns are scary
fuck u jack
twilight_sprinkle: Your supposed to have a cup! >:3
ALL IN FAVOR OF Stapling Jack Thompsons organs to an NES
guns are -not- scary
00,10especaly to a kid
Manly tears.
Guns are really bucking scary
ah, fair enough
guns are scary, thats why im a medic :D
Mega_Milk: high school soccer :P
Go to bed Wrek.
guns teach responsibility
Sumica: And I revert back to, Spec Ops the Line. :P
what happend i only rejoined
what now
Guns arent a joke.
P&T said sorry, more then Jack would EVERY do for all the crap hes done.
sup guys ._.
He was probably scared out of his mind, real guns are really scary shit, man.
13Buytoast: and that he was supposed to aim at a picture of humans
he cried because he got scared or what?
its just a kick, and a hole in something there.
I confess, it is fun to shoot at a range at targets of paper.
seriously, even if you never fire a real gun
but yeah, idiotic dcision to let the kid shhot
everyone should get a chance to shoot a gun. Guns are simply a tool and in responsible hands are no more dangerous than a knife or a fork
get an AirSoft GBB piston
twilight_sprinkle: No
twilight_sprinkle: Ohhhhhh.....ouch -lol
sup RDash5000
ima stick with airsoft
Sumica: that's why I don't want any real gun around :(
dat sandscreen
pistol*
It was NOT idiotic
what happend i only rejoined
lucky kid. I didn't get to fire a gun until I was 18
Hi, RDash5000. :)
what did i miss?
ive been shooting since i was 5
the kick of the damn things is terrifying
twilight_sprinkle: Ok i call that back. It doesn't seem that dangerous(physically) at the moment
AVS619: Don't be a pussy, shoot a 30-30, BE A MAN
Vordox: it was. he hurt himself and ended up crying
I don't see whats scary about a gun, the only thing scary is a irresponsible person holding a gun.
twilight_sprinkle: But what did he learn?
00,10dont blame you MadSurge. Dont agree with you but I dont blame you
i liked that football argument he did
silent stream is silent
Gnight everypony
it did seem to pack a pretty powerful punch
tf2
the first gun i shot was a 16 gauge shotgun
18-40 I was such a lousy shot
Night, Nerom. :)
so, how it's going for everyone?
Buytoast: its an assault rifle man
13Chrysalis: there was a cork pistol thing at the state fair too, i did horribly at that...
YES
Rubberfruit. <3
:D
Vordox: still too early, hes just 9. if he were at least 11-12
Dat Rubberfruit :D
dafuq?
13rifle you can spread the support along your arm, pistol it's just all there at your hands
twilight_sprinkle: Welcome to reality
?
RUBBERFRUIT!!!!
what happend? i only rejoined
dafuq is this
AND THEN
A demon exorcism?
dafaq?
legend of zelda?
Shizuka i used to airsoft alot, i have a full-weight m14-EBR
Must be Rubberfruit
:D
thats odd.
DashWithRainbows: Yep
BOOM
G'night everypony! :)

Night, GilDash :)
Night GilDash
and my pistol has enough kick that someone unprepared has dropped it before
Night GilDash!
Vordox: what reality, where some biased morons hurt a kid to prove their point? also theres no guarantee at all he learned anyhting. he might grow up wanting to get a second chance, and to be "manly" cause he screwed up as a kid
and those things dont even fire real rounds
dafuq?
I fired my first .45 when I was 8. I fired my first shotgun at 14. And my first rifle at 15.
twilight_sprinkle: YOu think so? Or you know so?
twilight_sprinkle: Doubt that seeing his family...
so confuse
what is happening
you must be a redneck
where have i heard the music before?
Magical Quest music? That was a random choice
Steampunk pyro.
Vordox: its a very common situation, especially seeing how it was shown on TV. i can easily see him wanting to prove himself now
the only real ammunition i ever fired were 3 .22 rounds
SirGanjalf: family only has so much influence
I'm going to bed too guys. Goodnight
05pfft guns
05i use an axe
twilight_sprinkle: The earlier, the better. Just saying
i fired 9mm, and .357
Night MadSurge
i was19 at that point
Night, MadSurge. :)
twilight_sprinkle: Yes, the show is biased. But it provides an alternative perspective on things that don't often GET that perspective.
Wrek why not your fists?
Wrek: i prefer katana
Also DAT HENRY HATSWORTH
what happend?
Vordox: i mean i agree that video games dont cause violence, but the show is absurd
Wrek: but same thing, we never run out of bullets
Wrek: My weapon of choice is a chain saw. But axe is a deffinate second.
twilight_sprinkle: Family is still the biggest influece.
I prefer a trout.
twilight_sprinkle: That I cannot deny :P
twilight_sprinkle: And that's part of a proper discussion, knowing both sides.
"(Ganon) You will die!"

CriticKitten: besides, they didnt mention a lot of things, like how games actually help release built up anger, and how tv is a stronger influence at times
but honestly, i'd love to get my hands on the trigger of an lmg one day. if only to find out if my shoulder could take it without breaking^^
hey guys,back.wuts this?
twilight_sprinkle: I think the kid will be fine. He likely learned something that day that will help him in the future, and his mother approved of the experience.

Hi, Scoot-Scootaloo. :)
play brony meadly by nrgforce
And yet people say this is good because it took "So much effort"
um.... what is this?
Effort does not mean quality
you are tearing me apart Sumica
and this was utter crap.
DashWithRainbows: BAHAHAHAH
05,15Effort does not me quality
Points for the art.
I was still in fast mode when it started. Bah. I'll watch it after the election.

05,15DashWithRainbows Damn you said it first
what.....is......this..
But get real VAs.
08,01Spectrum_Rush: should have used more lube, then
this tuing right there took barely any effort
00,03Original Character DO NO STEAL

NewDCD!!! O.O
08,01DCD! \o/
becasue if it had taken effort, it wouldn be so horrible
/me 08,01hugs NewDCD
Yeah I think the reason they went with OCs instead of the Mane 6 was because they didn't want them to make them "OOC" and twist them to their liking or something
This is the sonichu of the brony fandom
BRIGHT GREEN TEXT
Hi, NewDCD. :)
09,01this is your darkest hour
00,03How ironic that we have DCD come as we show this abomination...

09,01LIKE OH EM GEE GURLFREEND...me too.
NewDCD: stop molesting the channel members :p
Scoot-Scootaloo Wasn't there an animation for a pony song made before?
This can't be the real VAs. Seriously, get the real VAs on.
It was merely rushed so they could beat double rainboom at the title of first fan episode
and it was actually good?
09,01VOICES VOICES
How've you BEEN DCD?!
long time no see NewDCD
Hi NewDCD, yo now?

Holy Kamen Riders, its DCD!

00,03Yeah... let us never speak of that again....
JOOOOOOKAAHHH
: |
No, seriously. The joke's over. Real VAs now.
And I know the guy this made was French or German which must explain all the forgein actors
09,01but I decided to opt for a career change
NewDCD: You've been taking meds in your school?
09,01so yeah
inb4 he dies
Crystal Epire flag
ಠ_ಠ
Lunac: dat spoiler
oh, changing careers?
09,01no, I was an actual medical student
..................... o_o
I'd give a kid credit for doing animation on their own, but yeah....
09,01not anymore though
Your color.... green, is just so... Appealing O.O
05,15SONG TIME
NewDCD: Inb4 NewDCD knew what I meant :P
WHOUGH he's 9?
This IS the real VA, isn't it.
I kinda like the song :p
MUSIC!
9's not a kid?
pretty low voice for a 9 year old
Hopefully itll be a lot easier for ya DCD.
its not bad
man he sure dosen't sound 9
Hey Scoot-Scootaloo. Hey NewDCD. Long time no see.
¯\(°_o)/¯
Okay, one of the few good things. They got Mandopony to do this song
09,01his voice is hella deep for 9 years old
^
^^
NewDCD: i just said that
^^^

TACTICAL exposition SONG!
09,01also

flutterbutt: yea no
This song is also sort of shit.
fluttercry: Sounds good so far!
:D :D :D
oh god, this is that horrid 20 minute animation thing isn't it
the song is good
Let me guess his father died exporing some far off land
please
NewDCD what?
Tell me more
/me hugs DCD tight. Dude <3333
I don't see why everyone complains so much about this fan episode... Just go out and do better
09,01and with "sort of" you mean VERY shit
fluttercry: prepare to be assimilated
/me is Engi, nods to NewDCD
05,15Buytoast yup.
Yeah you make a nine year old character but you have no way of making him even sound 9
00,03Dat animation... it's like a 2D CGI thing..
I was trying to be nice.
09,01this coming from a guy that can't sing, that's a lot
I want to like all the fanmade stuff.
09,01YOU ARE ME
SUddenly STORY?
Lol
09,01I AM THE SHADOW
09,01THE TRUE SELF

How long has it been since you've been here, NewDCD?
O.o
09,01IT'S SYMBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLIC
i'm back again, Who's streaming?
it's like someone took that pony creator and decided to crap out some fan fic
Uh.
Yeah is he supposed to be his evil twin or dark side? Never really explained
(you know, because he's gay, DCD)
05,15DCD name a word that starts with F
This isn't a bad song... Seriously.
FSTEAK.
The voice is clean enough, the tunes are nice.
Yes, it is.
09,01FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFsteak?
It's a bad song, sorry.
¯\(°_o)/¯
00,03It's like a fanfic turned to an episode... a fan-pisode!
Vordox: the song is pretty good IMO

GOOD LORD.

Derp :P
So many misses of hints and links in the story so far.
Eh?

Spectrum_Rush: lots of room for improvement... this is pretty much just to shout "First!!!!!"
You know since we didn't actually change scenes

09,01"Yes, because I'm such a terrible villian the Mane 6 won't give me the light of day!"
MakerDusk: indeed, all just to beat double rainboom to the punch
but this video might enrage the masses to make better episodes
You should get a real VA is what you should do
cowvarkian: Nah, it's more about the structure of the Monomyth's principle, but still avoiding several important switches of eras and epos.
Hi, tSparx. :)
05,15Dark_Horst pretty sure yeah
This show only lasted for one episode before cancelation.
....
a cat
09,01no bro, that ain't teamwork
really
Hi tSparx :)
goddamn
A cat? The fuck

In this segment the Buddha is walking down an endless hallway
09,01UNLIMITED HALLWAY WORKS
do you know how hard it must have been for them to get a pegasister voice actor? those are a rarity
Vordox: pretty sure we werent talking about elder scrolls
cowvarkian: Oh it's not. It's basic.^^
Stop talking to yourself
YOU'RE STILL TALKING?!
hey there MakerDusk
Pray tell, what am I watching
?
MakerDusk: At this point? I'm pretty sure they could have picked people out of a crowd and found better VAs.
Hu
cowvarkian: Basically, "Context" is dropped and making it kinda confused and not able to be followed easily.
05,15Let's go eat huh?
explaining monologues dont feel as rightfully placed in storytelling as they thought they would
Pinkies4thWall: Fan made episode.

Bronysith: Wrong, not the animation
QUALITY CHECK
AHAHAA
05,15How do i voice acting?
cowvarkian: just because we run a network with standards... >_<
00,10oh them

So ...I still got about 70% of the content left, and already at 70% :P
09,01I tried the demo
Since Syfy has the rights to air the English dub of Gundam series, I could totally imagine them do a "How It's Made" spoof about Minofsky Particles.

A, industry.
cowvarkian: Better then I thought, gameplay wise it's new and innotative, HWOEVER, they lost some aestethic(The scary part), BUT It's scarier then the RE5, but the action scenes are plenty, but there ARE some part where it's scarier then RE4 even.
BUT

Is there a time limit for movies? What happens if a movie like Steohen King's The Stand is chosen?
so good things do come from fighting
what is the B movie?
The B movie does lok interesting though. I'll try to make it for that at least
Cypresswolf|Fable: I have a feeling that that would take FAR too long.
Wow. BMN is will be strecthing to over midnight. This should be interesting. :D
soulrider95: The Color of Magic, a TV movie that's like over 3 hours
No worries GuntherDW I got it :)
Kencolt: I know will :)
Cypresswolf|Fable: how long is it?
05,15Cypresswolf|Fable longest movie we've shown I think was LoTR Return of the King Extended cut which was like 5 hours
cachi01: About 12 hours.
wuuuuuuuuuuuuuut
12 hours?
5 hours oO
fak
cachi01: It's actually a very long 4 part miniseries.
Is this the first time BMN has been broadcasted over midnight? :O
*will be
We should watch The Cure for Insomnia
2 minutes to midnight
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0284020/
Check out that length
05,15AJIsAwesome hell no.

The Stand is 366 minutes long
= u=
Brb.
omg.....OMG........*struggles to keep mouth closed*
Batman Begins/Babes in Toyland lasted past 1am
That's a miniseries though
Endhiran was awesome.
Babes in Toyland is blacklisted. :D
05,15BABES IN TOYLAND NEVER HAPPENED
How long was it?
too long
00,10till we do night of the WMC for holloween
Yes.
I would love that. :D
05,15It would just be Epic Movie and Babes...which would be painful
05,15VERY painful
Night of the WMC?
Sumica: This year, or some other year?
i wonder what movie will be next
Add in Titanic II and it will make us all commit suicide
:L
OH SNAP
Titanic 2........
05,15I can't decide between Highlander or The Island of Doctor Moreau for B movie
Kencolt: Oh god.4
:D There's a film (experimental) with a runtime of 14400 minutes - 240 hours - called Modern Times Forever (Stora Enso Building, Helsinki)
jiggle
flutterbutt: highlander!

Cypresswolf|Fable: What? :D
05,15One has Sean connery, the other has Fauriza Balk as a cat girl hybrid

ASoftFluffyThing: birthday?
damn. I want to pick the recent Black Panther miniseries for B but its technically not a movie.
My Bronystate cakeday, I mean
the power of quality transportation!
That film sounds interesting - I might watch that if I can find it - filmed by Danish artist Superflex, shows centuries of decay supressed into the span of the film
superretroworld: Nope, birthday is in January. BS cakeday is next month
Tovler: but this week's b movie is a miniseries
ded
BOOM
It's almost been a year since i've been a brony :3

There was an Animal Crossing movie?

Forgot the pony episodes, but I think "Green Isn't Your Color" was one of thenm
my first movie night was Coraline and Clue =D

Gunthler: no that was babes in toyland
Meowception?: http://inception.davepedu.com/

superretroworld: i've already made so many friends!
05,15I don't know the full story, what I do know is there was some kind of ad that came up for the streamer and cats were meowing through inception
great
00,10dureing inception, an advertisment came up on the streamers webpage
fluttercry: the stream showed an ad for cats
00,10that was a cat going meow over and over

And then the movie had to stop for 15 minutes because everyone couldnt breathe
from laughter

while a (certain mod) cleared out the mess
and who were the spammers?
cachi01: IN other words, he handled it thye BRony way-- instead of trying multibans and paranoid attempts to regain control- we just moved to "the bar next door" and kept drinking. ^_^
*cough cough*
\
Kencolt: lol
00,10that's why we have alot of the channle modes that we use now
but it was hate spam? or just troll spam?
00,10such as +K and +j
Oh, and was anyone else there for when Vivi did speed speed racer?
+j?

00,10it was puppetmasters

I still have yet to see all of Anthology II

This Brian guy seems cool, but he's no Apollonius.

Ohai Lyra` :3

Wait, so the sacrifice thing wasn't real?
Romans go home

If I remember, this series has a sad ending
05,15lol no it's not real haha
if thats what you're into
DerpyMuffins: Bittersweet.
the ending is undecided
I guess
05,15Did you really think we'd charge 200 bucks for regs entry?
spoiler alert, snape kills dumbledore
nobody knows how it really ended
No....
/me points to topic
/me facekeyboards from taking stuff too literally
*my god. His name is Creflo Dollar in real life*
twilight_sprinkle: It is? I thought the credits showed what happened.

"you dont even have to be a regular to join!"
Well, the ending is decisive enough
Dat soaking
AJIsAwesome: idk they modified it at some, point i rea,d different versions too
but then again, we like to keep this room secret sooooo
i make it rain on dem hoes
twilight_sprinkle: AH.

You better than this
05,15Adult Swim did for a while
00,10they did cut the table love thought
Yes. I watched this on Adult Swim.
Table Love?
This was on Adult Swim?
05,15Sumica NOOOOOOO ANYTHING BUT THAT
Hm, I can't remember that scene.
AJIsAwesome: lol
DerpyMuffins, indeed
you dont remember a famous scene
00,10time for some code ment then
its kinda ridiculous
I don't. :D
i still dont know if i dislike that scene or not
And I watched the Japanese version. :D
idk what the writers were smoking when they wrote it
Awkward
mica
I don't clearly remember the table humping scene.
Kandarihu: Me too.
Not as awkward as I thought
I seriously don't.
Dammit
:\
05,15INDUCTION

"How long were you looking at my ass?" "Long enough"

Looks like i'll make it after all, Sumica

sweetie belle is 2nd best pony cuz she is the real sugar baby (refrence)
oh boi
05,15Sumica oh god...

Oh god :D
You know what Adult Swim always cuts out? Most (but not all) of the ED themes.
I honesltly can't remember> :D
do i want to know of table love? o.o
00,10after somthing else thought
Sumica: :'(
Euphy has the best scene EVER
I don't know why. :D
05,15Oh thank god
Kandarihu: ED?
Ending theme
momma says I'm best pony, what does that even mean?
closest i ever came to table love was stacking those small tables you move around one on top of the other
Pinkies4thWall: and the best episode ever, i mean seriously, that episode is legendary
LOL
lol
Oh :D
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

That ED song was by Ali Project, right?

Dat table
Oh god whateven
aaaand resume
what is sshe doing, i wonder
:D
..............
lol
HAhaha
:D
05,15dat laugh
Why was she humping the table?
Was there a reason for that girl to hump the table? Or is it just a senseless attempt at fanservice that just fell flat?
05,15fanservice
05,15became squicky though
00,10she realy loves the princess
I CAN SHOW YOU THE WOOOORLD~
lol
i need link to this
00,10it's called code ment
:D
Sumica, did i break Bill nye?
05,15Honestly I don't know what the hell was up with that scene.
00,10seems like it
Me neither.
00,10it was pointless
/me drinks champagne in a toast
plot, schmot
It was for the fans
O.O
That was actually one of the most pointless forms of fanservice I've ever seen.
i cant help but wonder who originally came up with that scene :O
05,15It's so awkward
Why would fans want to see someone hump a table?
i found it
ASoftFluffyThing: I have NO idea. :S
Code MENT is best code
dbz abridged next :)
thisguy: The writer for that episode
that'll do :3
ASoftFluffyThing becuse vampire
false, code geass is still best code
So is the consensus on that scene that it failed as fanservice?
00,10yup
05,15yup
I guess so
aye
05,15BONK
:D
dat scout
uhhhhh

twilight_sprinkle: i raise you a distillery
05,15Pinkie is second best pony
00,10hmmmmm this stream needs ponies I think
Speakers. Lower fidelity, more noise, SAFE EARDRUMS.
feels like mlp co-op with all the pinky
One of these days, someone is gonna sue Hasbro because some had a seizure
Pinkies4thWall: i raise you absent and vodka.
00,10what do you all think?
00,10needs more ponies?
nope
watches are now canon
If you eant to.
*want
needs more ponies
Sumica, and I need to be praying every time more of the time I'm in fast-lock
ITS A TRAP
yes
twilight_sprinkle: Absent? DO you mean Absinthe?
As long as its sea ponies
inb4 othe gen ponies :D
needs moar "Ponies"
Sumica: i think you have shown me a good video i haven't seen in ages. /)
Er...
Kencolt: oh thats how its spelled in english huh, yeah i mean that
05,15Isn't Absinthe illegal?
Sumica: name of video?
In some countries
05,15For some unknown reason
its illegal to drink without mixing it with water i think
00,10pink party pony pandamonium
pony skull :O
tnx :)
What Sumica said
i know its sold in france
Dammit sumi
more pony skull :O
05,15Oscar Wilde drank absinthe and he turned out just...um fine?
define "fine" o.O
Later ponies
oooh, this vid
I LOVE this video. :D
Bye, Pinkies4thWall. :)
this vid made me chuckle
I love this so much :D
oscar wild, is that the idiot who said stupidity is the greatest sin"
05,15I love how she's like "Shut the hell up"
"Fine"?
um, that's the spirit? o.O
this edited btw
twilight_sprinkle: Actually, until recently, Absinthe was illegal almost everywhere... the French wine industry in the late 1800's/early 1900's did a HUGE smear campaigm against it, claiming it drove people insane. Actually, the problem was people were buying it insteaad of wine.
:o
woot
O.o
*nods head to rythem*
6_9
Kencolt: hm okay
dat rarity hip check
dat rarity
05,15also, apparently nutmeg is a halucinagen
05,15wut
What?
05,15spelled wrong, but yeah
Nutmeg?
nutmeg? damn
DAT PLOT!!
Nutmeg causes bad trips though
Never really liked nuts
something tells me that'll be illegal if it turns out true
05,15it is true. not illeagl though

OH EF NO
BYE EVERYPONY

ooh, silent?
Bye flutterbutt :)

silent movies, it just lacks black-white colors and scratches
did anyone see the pic on tara strongs twitter of the babys first baby? thats messed up
like LoZ with all the text and ominous music 6_9
only without the "hey. listen"
Sumica: lets see if the laugh is on the back trck
I JUST realized that his face is the head of a pony. :S
00,10and then Flutterchu wonders why I dont like em at times
Really helps increase your respect for William Anderson
echo
^'
Is this the silent edition?
eh, maybe flutterchu was talking about something else
How did Cherilee NOT NOTICE THE OBVIOUS CRACKS?
is this just to listen to the background music?
DerpyMuffins: yes
FRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Background music eidition i guess
i dont see what could scare him in this more than usual
*edition
00,10yeah weeping_pegasi82
05,15You suddenly wonder why the voice acting is quiet during cutscenes
someone turned the "voice" volume off :P
Time for an hour of BGM eps
and sound effects o.O
mostly
poop rain
dat echo
05,15spalt
Rarity's BG music <3
so i guess music and voices arent on the same audio tracks
mmm :P
05,15Well it's starting to get that time of night when my spelling is off. I need to go to bed. G'night everyone

Looking back at this, I just realized those racoons.
Hi, NocturnalBlade. :)
they dont realize the whole crop has been obliterated o.o
[Belch]
Hey NocturnalBlade :)
hoi NocturnalBlade
Oh you, Pinkie <3
hi, we're watching ponies. wanna join?
hi NocturnalBlade
00,10sum NocturnalBlade
00,10sup*
its like ghosts talking there
haunted canterlot
00,10So much echo on tia's voice
indeed
Yeah, lol
00,10but then again they are in a stone room
/me hugs AJIsAwesome RaveBrony twilight_sprinkle thelonepony and Sumica :)
Some of the best use of BGM in the show in this scene
^
i am scared of canterlot now :(
00,10kinda cool how they ajust the echo effect for the enviroment
wow, got a hello from a mod...:$
Hehe
ghosts O.O
pinkie is a double agent
00,10ghost that like chocolate rain
MHhm
oh pinkie....you would let the world go nuts for chocolate rain :D
some stay dry, while others feel the pain
I LOVED Discord's echo in this upcoming scene.
00,10pinkie came back fast
Anyone notice the aura of Celestia's magic is a different color?
scared O.O
she's pinkie pie remember?
First Yellow, now a blue
00,10cause this is S1 animation
00,10not s2
i'd so shit myself if i heard that in rl
Lol
god i love you Discord ^_^
00,10they added a rule to the aura for magic in s2
Even silent BGM can't stop John deLancie
00,10the aura matches the ponies cutie mark
Oh?
Really?
you should have that echoing laugh as your ringtone
00,10yep
I seen her aura change like 4 times
Ill look at that more closely :o
never noticed that
I'd actually like to see Discord act mores serious if he returns. He can be VERY intimidating when he is.
mmmmagik
magic. *snort snort*
Not that I hate his goofy side, of course.
*more
Discord can brake the mute button, who knew?
00,10well you get a tast of it with fluttershy
like Joker
True.
00,10his serious side that is
pokes the chat
true Sumica
Ohai, Queen_Chrysalis. :)
/me is poked
00,10hi Queen_Chrysalis
i am never stepping inside a stone building, unless there were ponies in there
Twilight really should have thought that riddle out more
ohai Queen_Chrysalis :)
hi
ive been here the whole time lol
This is just great :D
omg its not like we can get guards to help
DerpyMuffins: That's one of the flaws I like about Twilight. She tends to overthink things.
lmao even without his voice, discord still cracks me up :D
superretroworld: What exactly would the guards do?
00,10his expresions are great
^
I feel like Im watching mimes
That reused heroic/friendship music
poor fluttershy
well, a giant labyrinth did spawn outside the castle, so it made sense thats where the elements would be
AJIsAwesome: atleast something, they never do anything
twilight_sprinkle: Wait, wasn't the lab there to begin with?
AJIsAwesome: idk
i thought it wasnt
since it goes away
00,10I love the discord starting trouble theme
after theyre done
Yea, follow the moving apples, makes sense
superretroworld: But when they do, they can't really accomplish anything.
never knew about the labyrinth before the episode
00,10it's like wimsical yet mennacing
AJIsAwesome: ik, which is why i feel bad for them
Never knew about the magic aura rule till now
superretroworld: Same, but that's the curse of most guards in tv shows.
/me quit *mwah* Goodnight everybody
DerpyMuffins: Same.
Bye, Dken2021. :)
whoops
nite Dken2021
night Dken, dream of ponies tonight :)
AJIsAwesome: ik, poor guards :D
im not sure the magic color rule is proven though
I have a secret
What is it, Malk? :)
I like ponies
00,10how so twilight_sprinkle?
me too <3
Malk: i did not know that >_>
00,10ew ponies
Sumica: idk i dont have a very good memory, but i thought there was one pony who didnt have a match, im not sure. it mightve been that pony who was making the peanut bitter sandwich
cool NoccturnalBlade
*butter
00,10mare do well ep
hey all.
00,10will have to check
hi Kurra
them balloons
do want :3
hey Kurra
hoi Kurra
:D I like this episode! It has accessibility for everyone! :D
00,10then again do we see that ponies cutie mark
Hi, Kurra. :)
its been a slow day here
i think we do
Hi Kurra :)
hi alla you :>
oh wait or maybe that was the theory about their eyes matching
<_<
>_>
i cant help but thing "ponies, the anthology 2" when i see this scene
is this like accessiblity recognition episode or something? :>
bleh i have a terrible memory for these things
00,10discord says fuck your mute button
"bam, bam bam bam. take that space. wanna go to earth. wanna go to earth"
Sumica: Because he's Discord
Discord should be the one to break the 4th wall, not Pinkie
she looks so cute with all the dirt all over her <3
00,10discord breaks all walls
DIAMOND
a big beautiful bedazzling BOULDER, the pioneers used to ride these babies
my fav pony <3 :)
twilight_sprinkle: Hold on there, Jethro!
Fluttershy counter trolls
ew fluttershy, go pls
also this video is one reason I cannot accept Dusk's Dawn as the first fan-ep
AJIsAwesome: whos jethro anyway
supa dooper creepy music
and best discorded character coming right up
00,10this video?
twilight_sprinkle: *shrugs* :D
Sumica, yes
the BG music and sounds
00,10ahhhhh
lol
bam-evil
Dusk's Dawn lacked a lot of that
00,10cause they put no work in to the foly
I always liked the music clip when they were discorded.
ah dusks dawn
even the BG pictures themself
dat tail whip
00,10they admit they rushed it too
yeah :/
i thought dusks dawn wasnt too bad if you dont expect mlp quality of it
00,10we watched it earlyer tonight
00,10it was painful
twilight_sprinkle: It's wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good IMO.
twilight_sprinkle, I wouldn't mind the video...IF IT DIDN'T CLAIM FIRST FAN-EP EVER
00,10you know that point when something is so bad you feel embared for the person doing it
Ill give credit to Project Interlude for the attempt
once you get passed the bad voice acting and detalization, its tolerable, the story seems pretty interesting
but it has ponies, so i'm okay with it
I kinda want to sleep on a cloud bed now
dusk's dawn? What is? o.o
CrimsonPhoenix: isnt it though?
It's not
care package on the way
They rushed it to STEAL that title
i cannot believe i went there o.o
from Double Rainboom
00,10Kurra, a fan made pony ep
RD broke da rulez
CrimsonPhoenix: its the first full on fan made episode completed to my knowledge
CrimsonPhoenix: ah i see. yeah they did seem to care a lot about their releaase date
Sumica, ooh, i wanna see *searches*
and the video was merely an internet flash video you would see on newgrounds
Double Rainboom has nothing to do with Dusk' Dawn's storyline
AJIsAwesome: the maze is gone now, idk
00,10yeah problem is I would say it's not compleet
I actually recorded us watching, but I don't know if I should upload it. Fluttercry PMed me and told me it would make us look like jerks
suddenly end theme
Sumica: eh, its /complete/
twilight_sprinkle: I'm guessing he was able to destroy the maze.
rather, released
00,10we are jerks =p
the nurses VA is hilariously unfitting
in a way, we all are
so were the mane 6 tonight, so we'll call it even :P
I'm back now
anyway I need to go to bed
Read Background Pony
J_E_Smith71: do it
bye CrimsonPhoenix
Good night
movie was...well I don't know what to say :P
Bye, CrimsonPhoenix. :)

Sumi you don
night crimsonphoenix. dream of ponies tonight
it was okish..
Whoops
/me expects an elevator music intermisson now and is unnerved when he doesn't hear one D:
Night CrimsonPhoenix :)
i gave it a like for effort, but yeah, it was rushed and loks like it was done just to claim the title of first fanmade ep which isnt cool
oh haha
Sumi you don't have a problem if I put it up?
thisguy, I'll dream of Lyra and hug her to warm her from her curse
poor her.....
Granted its no sound but anyways
twilight_sprinkle: Agreed.
nite CrimsonPhoenix
00,10I dont but I can ask if otheres do.
http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=261112433429
Dusk Dawn wasnt that bad
want some 30 year old candy? :D
twilight_sprinkle: Double rainboom?
dusks dawn story was somewhat interesting
hahaha sure :P
XAX: Dusk's Dawn.
XAX: isnt that still in development?
Oh.
twilight_sprinkle: It is.
okai
00,10hold on.
Well, off to bed for me soon. Later all
Yes, Sumica?
hold on to what???
night, midnight. dream of ponies tonight :)
bye Midnight_Fyre
Bye, Midnight_Fyre. :)
00,10this is double rainboom stuff
dabi plssss
nite Midnight_Fyre
Well I guess double rainboom lost the title of first fan made episode, but it will still have the highest quality fan episode title.
Night Midn- damn it :(
yay :)
...wow
This is...amazing
Now this is how it should be done
00,10exactly
Sumica: The audition clips for double rainboom are so good and cute and stuff ._.
Even shorter animations like Childern of The Night do it right
I honestly couldn't care about the "first" title, as long as it's done very well.
http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=130761801296
the animation is good yes, but who knows how the rest will be
I still love that :>
i love good and cute and stuff :)
defines the ponies
^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
00,10cause thes guys are taking time to get people on the team to do it right
http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=230865673698
Wait, isnt it already fall?
You know what I'm going to bid on that air freshener
DerpyMuffins: Yes.
oh yes :)
it is.
animation alone wont suffice though
they shouldve joined forces
haha nice
Sumica: don't forget the head guy will have a job at dhx too
thats always the way to g
*go
O////o;;....
ouch
Insect intake/
twilight_sprinkle: only if theres comparative advantage in both parties though
economically speaking
00,10yeah Spectrum_Rush
They really cant claim first fan-made episode anymore
derpy :D~!!!
But they don't NEED to, IMO.
00,10I love that derpy one
they should get the guy who did picture perfect pony, that dude was MLG
hiya guys
Is it REALLY necessary to have that title?
well I had a huge scare
otakon! *hugs8
Hi, otakon. :)
Hi otakon :)
Dat Lyra
hi otakon
uhh otakon i have some bad news
My pc wouldn't load up my desktop when I logged in at first
AJIsAwesome: true, it shouldnt be a big deal
superretroworld: what?
twilight_sprinkle: you mean brony dance party?
hi otakon
Even when you're first to do something there's always someone who can do it better later
otakon: communitys getting delayed
otakon: try hitting it, that fixes my laptop
superretroworld: damn
yeah well I managed to get it running by logging into my guest account
Dat Charmy
ik, just found out today :(
:D
00,10his early work
The bees
I love this one <3
twilight_sprinkle: i believe so, and no, they shouldn't join forces... brony dance party doesnt give them any extra animation benefits...
aw-awwwww
Oh god this <3
this is his early work? hot damn
dat pinkie <3 :)
aaaawwwwwww <3
They still need staff members btw
They have the same style: pony creator vectors :p
dat squeaking
Gummy :3
aaahh
DAT gummy
lol gummy troll
Bed timeee good night everyone! :)
00,10ok back to the ep

Goddamit my heart!
Night, RaveBrony. :)
Night RaveBrony :)
Night RaveBrony
nite RaveBrony
twilight_sprinkle: all it does is increase human capital, but if you ask me, i don't believe that it would make a difference
night ravebrony. dream of ponies tonight :)
now back to the show
so much cuteness from Pinkie in that vid <3
especially when they gain one animator with a very simular style
yes efficiency increases, but quality?
KICK!
Discord's line is true. "This fandom is the most fun I've had in eons!"
where's a drill instructor when you need one
twilight_sprinkle: exactly
still, hes a smidge bit better than their animation
picture perfect is the best animation out there
mmmmmm
i hate chocolate milk too pinkie >_>
00,10well twilight_sprinkle, seeing as it was mostly reused bits from the show I should hope so
i liek chocolate milk :3
or what's left of ponyville

twilight_sprinkle: I liek cereal. :3
:3
Sumica: you mean the picture perfect pony video?
00,10yeah
00,10most of it was puled edited and croped bits from the show
Im not much a brony dance party fan. tbh he just uses premade vectors and pony-creator skins and puts it all into a flash. There are so many more talented animators that deserve the attention he gets :p
00,10only the OC's and bits with ponies geting the looked changed were new
Wouldnt two sonic rainbooms be impossible?
Sumica: hence pony creator :p
hm, didnt know he reused stuff though
00,10aye
DerpyMuffins: If two pegasi were doing them at once then no
Yes 2 ponies
Speaking of Tom, he needs his own trading card: http://i1086.photobucket.com/albums/j455/TheDescendantofKehAn/TomCard_zps5c9a7f66.png
is it me, or do the look a bit cuter when they're all gray? no? just me? o.o
00,10the bit with photofinish out of her useal out fit was actaly trixie
oh that reminds me, i still need to make that black red alicorn oc in pony maker with fangs and bat wings
Tom Is best rock :3
Tom needs his own MOVIE.
But how many ponies do we know can do a sonic rainboom?
Either that or his own episode.
twilight_sprinkle: its pretty obvious, in fact, pony creator allows you to custom move the ponys position... in theory he could get away with using pony creator and flash
RD= Sonic Rainboom, FS= Sonic Shyboom :3
still, although it doesnt take as much talent, it sure was an effect method. perhaps they should use it more often
*effective
With with all the sonic?
twilight_sprinkle: true, and as long as he gets out content that goes with quality original content, people are happy
(Chaos, confusion, evil, meow()
hence [PMV]s
brb guys

restoring my system from a day ago
Those have to be my favorite lines from Twilight
And Twilight doesn't realize they wouldn't work yet
ever since I ran HP Support Assistant my PC hasn't been acting right
<3 yay fluttershy
00,10ewwwwww HP
ponies? what is this madness?
spike is best rainbow dash
Again Twilight you think this was going to work without RD ?
twilight_sprinkle: there is only a total of one classic PMV in existence that i actually enjoy
hello there everypony
heeeeres tommy!
Hi, xMLPxREACTORx. :)
i dont think she cares if it works at this point
o hai xMLPxREACTORx
Hi xMLPxREACTORx :)

twilight_sprinkle: :D
Dem white folks over at bronystate are so nice, they treat us so good.
twilight_sprinkle: its by BronyVids
Im surprised Twilight has such control over the elements since she has only used it once before
But! I has to sleep.
Night guys!
twilight_sprinkle: :D
night Barbetos
Bye, Barbetos. :)
bye Barbetos
why are ya'll surprised theres ponies Sumica streams them all the time
Night Barbetos :)
sumica is best pony
night barbetos. dream of ponies tonight :)
I sad I has to leave on a sumi stream. =(
whoever edited this did a pretty decent job quieting the vocals and BG noises
Oh well.
Dat timing. :D
Catch ya later.
screwball
Will I'm going to be geting off in a little but I just had a question what is this thing with Luna called children of shadows?
ill pm you
Anyone notice that Derpy is the only one not affect by this?
00,10StupidSexyCJ, they used the 5.1 audio eps
well, i dont see derpy anywhere here, so i cant really know myself
00,10and just turned off the front channnles
DerpyMuffins: does not appear during these scenes
I actually had a mini theory once that Screwball was Screwloose discorded, but seeing how they have differnt cutie marks it wouldn't work.
Sumica: ah
xMLPxREACTORx: wow im surprised you havent seen it, its been streamed here several hundred times. its a pmv thats almost finished
00,10hence the echos
00,10and being able to hear any off camera voices
looks like theres someone else looking on a really dead spyro forum that I found
it was scary when there was a conversation back at canterlot o.o
It would be interesting to see how Screwloose became who she is.
xMLPxREACTORx: i think its about some fanfic
all the echos and such. i almost thought that place was haunted
o well thanks for the info guys
xMLPxREACTORx: I think it explains it in the video description.
It supposedly takes place after the first defeat of Discord I think.
I still think Twilight could defeat Discord on her own if she channeled the power of her Element
pigs flying. now i've seen everything
man, it's shizuka here
o.o I almost brought a tabby cat inside
Making a feeble old women dance like that, Discord you bastard
spiderman wants your friendchips
i'd like a pet cat :3
thisguy: get a dog instead
Funny how the Princess always knows what to do
twilight_sprinkle: i dont get that meme
Almost like she knew what Discord was going to do
itd be nice if the princess actually did something herself instead of manipulating the mane 6
superretroworld: its just a pretty random video on youtube
oh
If only that tabby cat acted germane.
wait, that's derpy
I'd like to see the Princesses do something for once instead of being in the Castle all day
it has 60's spiderman :P
and saintly
i can still hear them a tiny bit XD
00,10some like to think that luna sent all the letters back to twi
:P
60s spiderman is brilliant
<3 Give me all your friendchips
looking for what?
Bittybittybittybitty
00,10cause she was studying them to be able to learn about friendship
Sumica: why Luna?
Ambient bird noises
biddidy biddidy biddidy
best part
heh
<3 hnnnngh
<3
do you mind if i kidnap you?
twilight_sprinkle: I understand what you mean, but I have a head theory that because she's been busy maintaining stability in Equestria (to the best of abilities, of course), she hasn't used her magic a lot in ages.
daaaaaaaw
13nimbus away!
meep meep
*mini head theory
but she only has 2.3 wingpower
AJIsAwesome: twilight should be supreme overlord of ponyland!
You know how on most forums it'll tell you if there are any members or guests that are looking at the same topic as you?
twilight_sprinkle: Agreed. :D
Fluttershy of course you can kidnap me <3
PINKIE!
Shizuka: that looks more lika a cumulus :S
Fluttershy cant fly that fast
Oh, Pinkie. :D
stay away from me fluttershy, i dont like you.
Shizuka: Power-rope extend!
THAT BIG DUMB MEANIE!!!!
<3 :)
FLUTTERRAGE GO!
wow, the instrumentals are good
Fluttershy speed : Mach 1
How'd she tie ropes around her hooves?
this instruamental was probably done in a program though
magic
with a lasso?
it sounds like it
:D
I really call BS on this, no way Fluttershy can match RD's speed
:d
RD wasnt flying though, she was using her cloud thing
well, she was slowed down by pinkie and rarity
chaos comes with pie?
MY LEG!!!
MY LEG

MY MEME

Dat quote
and chess boards
night everypony
bye superretroworld
Famous last words for Twilight
She wasn't really flying, just attempting to out run them. If she wasn't rifing the cloud of course she would definitely out speed them but considering that she considers that piece of cloud Cloudsdale I can see why she would ride it.
Night superretroworld :)
Bye, superretroworld. :)
night superretroworld. dream of ponies tonight :)
yeah
*riding
And Discord doesn't notice their undiscorded
CARE BEAR STARE
Dang it Pinkie get over and help us
Anyone wonder what Elements Luna and Celestia were??
TASTE THE RAINBOW, MOTHERFUCKA
DerpyMuffins: That's an interesting theory.
ouble rainbow all the way across ponyville
Discord just got stoned
Sweet sweeeet victory
celestia: all 6
star wars :)
were the hells celestia in all of this
Celestia seems to be Honesty, Kindness, and Loyalty
oh spike...
Yeah, it said there was a guest looking at the thread I posted
and trolling
Cya everyone
bye derpymuffins
Bye DerpyMuffins
about this place?
dat new hope
:)
xMLPxREACTORx: The same place where Luna was at the wedding
yay :)
AJIsAwesome: btw, celestia was kinda useless during the changeling attack too
Luna and Celestia are obvious Yin and Yang themed.
twilight_sprinkle: true.

Sumica: Just search "Blow PMV mlp" and it should be the first video
00,10local files Eddmario
search youtube for it
lol
sorry for the idle, browsing ebay
Sumica: need link?
00,10you can link to my HD
running something through youtube at the same time as streaming kills the quality
np haha
00,10and the file name is complex as fuck due to the ripper copying the video title from youtube
00,10✭ρ♏V ✭ ~ ♪♬ ~ в ℓ σ ω ~ ♪♬ __ ∂αяк нσσƒ ѕтυ∂ισѕ ❤ _
00,10is the name of it
dayum lol
6:O
Scootaloo <3
scoo-tl-oo
yeah thats it Sumica
00,10also this is an example of a video removed from youtube
lol
Sumica: you could search Dark Hoof Studios and find it that way
hm, wonder why theyd remove this
why did this get removed? :(
twilight_sprinkle - probably got nicked by a filter
i already have the blow link on copy paste
Haters ?
00,10they never say
also, where is that fluttershy from
Sumica dances to the music while fitting music plays
00,10good thing I saved it and reuploaded it though
lol
yeeeeeees!
MirrorImage: how does that work?
every
twilight_sprinkle - youtube has a system called "Content ID"
Ive been getting an interest in pinball machines now :P
00,10could even just be the user did't like ponies any more
where basically a copyright holder uploads the video once
MirrorImage: ah ok i see
and if someone else uploads a video that contains bits from that video, it gets tagged and removed
Sumica: couldnt you just rename the file so its not coded so weird, or does it not work that way
?
00,10but yeah that system is why i cant upload gundam style to youtube
00,10I could Spectrum_Rush
You gonna start hoarding pinball machines now haha
okay thx for expaining MirrorImage
00,10but i dont normaly look for it
I dunno
if they are fun
Sumica: gangdam style*
and for that particular video, it pulls from so many songs it's basically like shooting buckshot at the system
I just love the 80s tabletop ones
00,10If I ever fix my video anounce scrip i would rename it
you'll hit *something*
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41nuTHgxPn4&feature=related
after watching it you just wanna play it :D
bleh, id like this song, but why does have to be about sex...
Mooo
Memomoooo
twilight_sprinkle - that's why my car music is now home-burned pony music CDs
twilight_sprinkle: its about sex?

NocturnalBlade: yup
Twilight is so adorkable

00,10to think this whole my colecting videos from youtube came from win XP had issues with my streaming from youtube

/me smacks AJIsAwesome around with a large cow to make him feel better :3
00,10the sound would break realy bad

11,02I deep fried French Fries earlier with canola oil and lard o3o
00,10yeah I better wrap up soon ^_^
Poor ashens :<
._. NewSuperBronyU
NewSuperBronyU: Sounds delicious. :O
the "PMV - Pony Polka" series is great too
NewSuperBronyU - what did your arteries do to deserve that?
11,02I wanted to try and copy Heart Attack Grille .-.
00,10I would try making PMV's but all my pony eps are in MKV
11,02Didn't do anything special to it really
NewSuperBronyU: I don't see a problem with that. >_>
i ask again.
00,10Vegas cant read MKV
what did your arteries do to deserve that?
NewSuperBronyU: poor dr. Ashens :<
So, my dog bit me on the hand a week ago
ouch
why?
:(
what you do to it?
there has to be a plugin or converter for it sumica
otakon: Like the Medic says, I HAVE NO IDEA!
thats why i dont like dogs
you had to have done something
Sumica - can Windows Movie Maker read mkv?
the only time my cat bites it as after i deliberately make it very angry :D
could probably out it to AVI if it could
00,10yeah I can convert them to AVi but take forever and there is a quality loss
Sumica: I downloaded the first season via torrent and the whole second season, one episode at a time, with YouTube downloader ._.
i miss my kitteh..
twilight_sprinkle: What happened?
AJIsAwesome: i moved :P
twilight_sprinkle: Lol, mine really gets into playing. I had to pry her claw out of my skin when she snatched my hand up going for a toy. Hurt... like hell....
:(
twilight_sprinkle: Ah.
AJIsAwesome: it lives with my parents
Okay.
aww well i hope ypu see your kitteh soon twilight_sprinkle :3
He was just being naughty all day. I went to give him a small slap to let him know I was mad and he bit me as my hand got near him. He actually bit pretty deep and I was actually bleeding. It hurt like HELL!
i want to visit mah kitteh..
i live in colorado and a 10 was brutaly killed and kidnapped RIP jesica ridgeway :'(
thelonepony: at least a month until then though
My dog's incredibly hyper. She won't even lick you, she'll just bite you for fun. :D
The weird thing is, dogs normally love me
Silver_Soother: heh yeah mine gets like that too, but my cat is actually really really nice
Silver_Soother: it even plays fetch with me :D
AJIsAwesome: Lol; mine does the same. She'll come up and just put your hand in her mouth. xD
It's a friendly bite, of course. :D
Seriously, we know some people who's dog will bark or growl at anybody that gets close to it, but it actually let's me pet it
My Parrot always "barks" like a dog when People Come over :D
twilight_sprinkle: If I threw something for my cat to fetch, it would grab it, and look at me like I am crazy.
00,10great early pmv
^
11,02Call of Duty Black Ops II broke GameStop's Preorder record :D
its still on youtube
NewSuperBronyU: How many? :D
my cat will just lay on u and lick u:)
And still just short of 1M views
Sumica: You mean early as the first PMV of tuesday teh 16th, right? After all, it's about 10 after midnight here.
You know what I really want/
*?
Silver_Soother: aw kittehs so cute ^3^
A parrot.
Eddmario- no, early as it in came out last... februrary?
2011
I LOVE birds.
i hate birds
ESPECIALLY parrots.
they keep me up at night
Birds hate me.
i hope you get a parrot AJIsAwesome :3
twilight_sprinkle: I can understand that.
thelonepony: Thanks> :)
i get all sorts of murderous desires when a bird wont shut the f*ck up at 4 am
00,10used to have a mocking bird that liked to start up in the trees at like 2 am
So, who else has the Samsung Galaxy S III as their phone?
00,10introduced it to a presureised watere sprayer
Sumica: oh i need to try that
twilight_sprinkle: My bird never tweeted at night, just during the day. It would NEVER stop chirping. Then the other bird would just chirpping... Oh god, the noises...
Sumica: You are my hero.
i was just thinking of wacking the tree it was in with a bat
and you thought your cats hated when you hit them with the spray bottle...
dont have a bat though..
11,02They haven't said how much yet. They probably will release the info once the game comes out so they know the total amount of preorders.
00,10i punted taht bird out of the tree and sent it at least a block through the air
So, who here has had those Starbucks Vita things you can buy in the coffee aisle at Wal-Mart?
haha nice Sumica
Sumica: Did you film it?
Sumica: Haha
00,10dont have a camera
Sumica:thats actually kinda mean...
o.o
00,10yep it is sonicandmario85
Yes!
Oh god, haven't seen this since season 2 ended
Butt fun :D
twilight_sprinkle: Think so.
kaplah
i have this bookmarked :D
i also hate dogs becaus ethey used to keep me up for hours during high school. it was insane, they would bark monotonously for hours and hours and hours like some cyborg dogs
Mmm I need to download this video
I have the mp3
After that bad game PETA made recently, I don't think anybody gives a fuck about animal rights anymore...
Kapla!
:D
Another well put together and flowing vid "PMV - The Stars Will Aid In Her Escape (Cosmic Love)"
do you not know what an osalater relay is?!
DeadpoolDash|GW2: Didn't they have to repost that?
x.x
NocturnalBlade: Nope, I do not
NocturnalBlade: *oscillator?
00,10this is probably the most "what video is this" video I have
its been up since last november
ASoftFluffyThing: i need to get the mp3 of this lol
Eddmario:that super chick sisters game was kinda fun i actually like it exept for the fact that they are making mcdonalds evil
twilight_sprinkle: thanks you...i tried XD
Sumica Well it's god damn good
11,02wut video dis?
*thank
NocturnalBlade: lol ok
NewSuperBronyU: star wars 5
sonicandmario85: I'm referring to Pokemon Black and Blue version...
Eddmario:i know
NocturnalBlade, download it now
NewSuperBronyU leaked BLOPS 2 gameplay
00,10it's called "bad dragon product review"
The neighbors on both sides of my house on the same side of my street both have dogs. To the left of my house are two dogs who are ultra-territorial. They bark at me like crazy (especially the pit-bull) and refuse to back down unless their master TELLS them to back down.
lawl
11,02there no str wrs 5, they made 3 str ews moveys
NewSuperBronyU: it's called "Butt fun"
11,021, 2, and 3
Sumica Oh god i feel like i should feel silly for knowing what that is
:D
sexy dungeon
NewSuperBronyU: totally, and jarjar is best character evah
what is this i love it
I <3 dogs. They're the best pets. Cats on the other hand suck, and I'm not just saying that because I'm allergic to cats...
00,10the real question is how many went and looked for that just now killerpony7733 =p
dogs are dangerous and loud, i dont like them
shiningdawn: This is the future
I didn't :D
Sumica 1-3-5 people?
some one plz tell me plz
gonna idle for a bit
a dog can kill you if it decides to, a cat cant
The neighbor to the right of my house has this little dog who is sweet as can be. He only barks at the squirrels in the trees. He's been neglected most of the time because his master is a workaholic.
shiningdawn: how do you not know???
I like dogs over cats, but I'd love to have a cat.
Admit it, you can't watch/hear this WITHOUT dancing...
Fukkiereta? Okay then :)
I loved how cute little Boba Fett was in episode 2. I'm glad there are only 3 Star Wars movies
k
DAT EAGLE HYBRID
my neighbors had a dog, that thing would bark loud as hell henever someone walked by...
"PMV - Appleloosan Psychiatrist" is still good too
ASoftFluffyThing: downloaded lol
sad face
00,10indeed it is good
DeadpoolDash|GW2: I don't think any PMV for a terrible song can be considered "good"
whats wrong shiningdawn :(
twilight_sprinkle, a cat can hurt you pretty bad if you handle one wrong. They never hurt humans on purpose. But accidents can happen if they're scrambling.
00,10some day I should just set my player to play folder from my pony videos and leave it running all day
that is a great song
This used to be ponies. Where did they gooooooooo?
Kandarihu: accidents can happen with naything though
00,10shiningdawn i just gave you the name
Myon Myon Myon <3
*anything
Ah there we are
When I die, I want this song played at my funeral
00,10it's Caramel
This still counts as a pony video to me.
What Kandarihu said
Ohai ValtheJean~
00,10val you joined just in time
this is considered a ytpmv i believe
Ohai, ValtheJean. :)
Ohai ValtheJean :)
x.x
hi ValtheJean
Hi ValtheJean
What I wanna know is how the hell we haven't had a Digimon/MLP PMV yet...

o.O
OH SWEET JESUS NOT THIS AGIAN!?
2,14 you know, I've had a pretty shitty day today. But god damn this makes everything better
Is this the wish episode with that girl dragon? I love this episode!
Sumica play the hole season of g3
ValtheJean: good for you :P
Seriously, NEVER ask for ponies here.
Hope everything gets better, val.
yyyaaayyyyyyyy oldschool ponies!!!!!!!!
yeah, our misery amuses you much? :D
Sumica:PLEAS EHAVE MERCY TAKE IT OFF PLEASE!!! D:
lol
you are NOT Pinkie
the njust ask rainbow dash.. oh wait
Silver_Spoon: You don't say. :P
dohohoho dashing, dohohoho
you are NOT Rainbow Dash OR Cheerilee!
Ugh, I'm gonna need some Tiara_Why after this...
/me sits beside ValTheJean, pair of sh&$%#-y day ponies, RAWKEN
Eddmario: wow lol
now commence the conflict! :|
hummingbird pegasus ponies?
you are NOT Sweetie Belle OR Scootaloo!
Otakon Yesh they are silly
looks like poop
why do they're hooves look like they're infected D:
/me /)
Tovler: Flutterponies
00,10scootaloo and chearlee are sisteres
they're popeye ponies
cheerilee does sound like a younger cheerilee
forget chibi ponies
aaaaaaaaand cap'd
everyone else calls them "pine trees" :\
Isn't the VA for Scootaloo in this the same VA as Luna and Rarity?
so.... where is Granny Smith in this??
I guess those are bug wings.
p4ngya: it's the simple deformed style they're animated in i.e. huge heads, tiny bodies and huge dispropotioned legs
00,10yep
Kurra: dead
and dear god those ponytails
Kurra: This is during Discord's reign
dear god those everything
Eddmario: yh that's Tabitha St. Germain... great VA
/me baps otakon with an aircraft carrier, that's mean D:
this isint that bad accually
Kurra:
the irony?
Kurra: it's TRUE dammit
the ponytails are the only redeeming quality of this cheerilee
00,10better then g3.6
those hooves are like popeye's forearms
^^
Eddmario: nice
^^^^
thisguy, the 190,000 tons of IRON-y.... XD
hence the term "popeye ponies
"
Sumica: yeah but Dusk's Dawn was better than THAT
twilight_sprinkle: LOL
00,10I would rather watch g3.6
2,14 I'd debate that
p4ngya: so the radiation caused their hoofs to mutate
00,10then duskdawn
just wait for something interesting to happen here
2,14 at least 3.6 had the rights to make the damn show -_-
you'll be here for quite a while
Ugh, must. Not. Shoot. Self. In. Head.
/me has presidential debate about 3.6 with ValtheJean, takes notes while they speak
Holy shit, that painting pony is that chick from all the Jak and Daxter games!
what version are these?
eh id say dusks dawn is better too
huh...this ain't half as bad as I thought.
trust me, you're better off staying behind, cherillee
...Am I developing Stockholm Syndrome?
2,14 the precurser to why Cheerilee doesn't have a special somepony
ValtheJean: hmmm?
so… stuff
dat stuff
you mean add-ons?
expansions?
00,10forever a pone
2,14 perhaps maybe, just maybe, if they had decorated tree ornaments with her, she may have found love, rather than become a reclusive teacher :P
You have a bunch of Sweetie stuff
yeah, get the hell out of that show
WELL; as much fun as this TOTALLY is, I have some Dr. Who to catch up on. Have fun everypony!
It's stuff that you stuff other kinds of stuff into and stuff
AHHHHH!!!! What's with those wings? o_O
I love the narration in this most
00,10dumb rock
Bye, Silver_Soother. :)
ValtheJean: I'm pretty sure she dated Lyra when she was in college...
Bye Silver_Soother :)
bye Silver_Soother
inb4 its revealed that Lauren Faust is the narrator.
A ROCK???
that's not pinkie
Silver_Spoon: They're bug wings, I think.
Bye Silver_Soother
Sumica: Do I wanna know why you have the past generations?
she'd never behave like that
THANKS.
bye Silver_Soother
ok that rock made me laugh
;.;
00,10cause it's good
Tom's origin?
I got a rock
Charlie Brown's pinecone, it seems
Eddmario: Past gen MLP isn't that bad.
that's Sweetie Belle? O_o;
salvage materials there
Glitter :D
Gen 1 I think is pretty good.
AJIsAwesome: Well, the G1 pilot isn't anyway. The rest are terrible though.
i know, lets all them all "supposively" ponies
needs a little bit more GLITTER
Eddmario: True.
Shees a good knocker
did she just say...cool beans
cool beans
Wait this is G3 and Rainbow's not British?
00,10and then they done fucked up
that's "supposively" pinkie pie. "supposively sweetie bell" etc
Onnichan~
Wait, is this G3 or G3.5?
I want my Applejack and Megan back. I want my fun back.
oh, you have fucked up now!
00,10g3
Eddmario: Gen 3.5
Wait
Eddmario: G3, I think...
Don't they know where glue comes from?
3.5
something? they just called her a something -.-
I thought Gen 3 was older aged?
I stand corrected :x
2,14 Sumica, shamfur dispray
You know, there is a whole G1 series. My Little Pony Tales is an adventure-based series that's more in line with the pilots.
Pinkalicous?
00,10yup
2,14 this is 3.5 you silly filly
Ah.
OKay.
The meme was foreshadowed even in G3
Sumica: Wait, isn't G3 the one where Rari-I mean Rainbow Dash is british?
needs more glitter
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
dohohohoho she said dash again dohohohohho
Needs more glitter
Princess Promenade is example of G3
6_9
It could DEFINITELY need more gliter.
......um........sorry about that
*glitter
See this kids? This is why Discord was turned to stone
I MUST LEAVE BRONYSTATE UNTILL THE DEMONSPAWN ENDS
could use more Mariah Carey
Bye, sonicandmario85.
bye sonicandmario85 :)
sonicandmario85: Why leave when it's pretty much over now...
sonicandmario85: it will never en, this is our new master @_@
<Wonde if Scootaloo and Sweetie get their cutie marks, they'll be cheap and copy the G3 ones
I don't really see this as 'demonspawn", IMO. :S
or Aaron Neville
CR is right. These ponies have nothing to say.
bye, sonicandmario85 :)
It's not good, but it's not bad.
^^^^
um.........?
dont leave me with the G3.5s O.O
Oh god, it's Discorded Mayor Mare...
that the mayor?
DEAR CELESTIA Aaron Neville as special guest star on pony IMAGINE IT GUYS
yeah, its not bad
o.O

this dry whaaa poniesnothing wrong nothing they are a like nothing wrong
nope none at all Eddmario >_>

NewSuperBronyU Voice :3
twilight_sprinkle: Yep.
what are those tentical things?
dat music
aw ok

:D
thelonepony: oh know i got a wolfsposivon

ah ok :3
dammit
DAMMMMMMMMMMIT!
/me gives NewSuperBronyU a box of chocolate waffles
NewSuperBronyU: moo
therainbowvortex: how :3many points you rack up
Tovler: why?
im tgoing 4 the high score
You have to have faith in the game
suddenly dies
damn it Keyboard :<
you can do it!
dat pressing :D
NewSuperBronyU: oky
"Dont screw up." - NewSuperBronyU
"Don't screw up." NewSuperBronyU
i will remember this quote forever
^
i got another wolfsposivine 140 points
that's alwase the case NewSuperBronyU
dammit
aw snap
brb
shouldnt have said anything NewSuperBronyU lol
;-; I just don't know
damn he went too fast that time
lol
they probably dont need to test it that precisely though, knowing the programmed speed
test it that much i mean*
yes i got 65 points thistime
that was bullshit NewSuperBronyU you went THROUGH that platform
Problem is, you can reload from saves in a game but not life.
How does this compare to the bonecoster from NSMBW?
wooo
that didnt last long lol
Tovler: around the same
NewSuperBronyU: saw one perfect run on YT
You Can Do It!!!!!!!!!
^^
I'm not entirely sure. Your knowledge of this stage shall be great.
Just keep swimming
NewSuperBronyU: don't helicopter and just run jump
dammit
too short
wat?
i wiss i could play this
otakon: That grandma will ALWAYS hit you if you try to attack her.
AJIsAwesome: oh
Never jump on the green ones.
I eat green grannies
Attack from the sides.
granny smith apples that is
i just saw a video of a guy who did a perfect run of the entire 5th chapter of super meat boy
twilight_sprinkle: Nice!
that's ridiculous
lol
You turn into a little old cranky lady
DAMMIT
all dem tentacles
I couldn't do this game
I get frustrated WAY too easily with platformers like this
i wouldve broken my controller after the first few levels
^
i HATE redoing the same level over and over
it infuriates me
NewSuperBronyU: dead center of the pirahna plants I think
This looks about the same as the gold levels in DKCR
Too bad there aren't any Lums in this stage.
too bad you can't take a goddamn hit
I hate 0 health systems
Well you can, if you carry a heart over from a previous stage.
THat's what I do sometimes.
AJIsAwesome: yeah good luck with THAT in THIS stage
I know. :D
otakon: have you ever played Prinny Before?
In Hard Mode
"Hitting on Rayman" :D
DAMMMMMMMMMMMMIT
:D
/me thinks on hitting on Rain Man
NewSuperBronyU: Hit the green one, bounce off of it, and the helicopter to the platforms..
NewSuperBronyU: try STOp running and WAIT for her to lift up a bit
dammit
I thought the point of this game was to spite Mario
Yeah I would have been cussing like a sailor by now at the very top of my lungs in anger
If you think this stage is hard now
I read that as Sailor Moon >,<
NewSuperBronyU: eeyup
Try 4 player CO-OP.
Yep.
I can.
no NOT Sailor Scout
we can here the music NewSuperBronyU
just plain Sailor
Music is coming in clear
lol
I love that beyonce song
I was gonna do that
what?
no worse than you, me, and Dupree
I have heard great things about Ted
It was good?
is it out on DVD yet?
I can hear it NewSuperBronyU
AJIsAwesome: I heard it was hilarious
Ah.
Did you see Ted before or after Flash Gordon?
I didn't see the appeal in the commercial, so I thought it would tank.
FINALLY!
lava?
Yay! :)
bum bum bumbum bum bum
WAHT?!
Yep
Lava
goddammit
LAVA?!
I t gets worse. :D
thinking positive thoughts about Seth MacFarlane helps too
Serpent Like Lava D:
FUCK
Just wait until the secret in this stage. :D
goddammit what masochists DESIGN this shit?
dat amerispanish :D
k im back i had to go check on my cat
need a drink
brb
otakon: probably the old platformers tactic, make a game hard to make it feel long
NewSuperBronyU: Can you wait in the room at the final part of the stage? I want to hear that music again. :D
I'm always surprised at how I can beat these kind of games after 10 minutes
oh god NewSuperBronyU , how do you manage to multitask so well :D
i could never talk and play this game
lul
dayum
bugger all
Bon bon bon *imagines that Lyra is singing the manly part*
Newbrony streaming, AND on mic, turning off Dr. Who to watch. :3
SB is OP, nerfpls
Now, even though I like how the Wii version managed to pull this off very well, I prefer the ps3/360. Mainly because you actually GET rewards for doing this kind of stuff.
Hope Wii U has an achievements system.
Writing down wisecracks/riffs for notes helps me remember stuff
Also, welcome back Silver_Soother|Drwho. :)
AJIsAwesome: Thanks. :)

It's ALWAYS that part.
That one part kills you.
Man, you're 2 hours behind me.
The anticapation is going to kill me...
I forgot, what was the price for it?
Tree Fiddy
I've had enough will power to wait for Season 3 of MLP, I think I just MAY have enough for the Wii U...
Will Sumica be in EQLA?
Cawafornia?
Make sure to take pitcures. :(
Silver_Soother: I love the Power Glove. It's so bad.
I live in Illinois; no way in hell I can get to Cawafornia in time. :(

I forgot Walking Dead season 3 premiered yesterday.... I need to catch up still...
Okay, who recorded me in the shower? WHO DID IT?!
those gross-out cartoons of the 90s
owch
It's cause Rayman is a total ass.
^
I guess you're curing her or something
rayman is actually probably a wanted insane murderer
twilight_sprinkle: :D
twilight_sprinkle: In reality, this is some poor grandmother just doing her nails...

especially platformers
Hatered for old people is no reason to kill them!

DoctoDoctorWho: Morrowwind, I could play that again.
/me sees this video and cries....
WHYYY
FLASh
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Vordox: There are a few reasons you are acting this way...
Vordox, beycase you.. i dunno
the sweetie belle version
Silver_Soother: Yeah, cause I had a fully functional code, I MADE a Rhythm is Magic game..
But then the specifics comes, and the game was scrapped due to Flash's Sound API
:( I have no idea how bad that must feel. But it must've been a waste of a LOT of time.
8 months
I'm trying to find alternative but...
nemnemnemnem
Ouch...
Rainbow Feedback: Pretty awesome, but could be about 20% cooler.
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout

Sumica, lets hopp its coon no?
Jmo, who da faw you talkinn ito?
You.

Hmmm, looks interesting; easy to pick up, but hard to master kind of game.
Nope
You're the only drunk here.
/me is not dunk .___.
Jmo: Does sleep despravity count?
Nop
Okay, then, you're right.
Silver_Soother: what theme did they combind with morrowind to make skyrims theme?
Jmo waiting for the GF t oget home... so cant seleep
...
Meh
gosh my spellin so attrocioud
DoctoDoctorWho: It's pretty much a reprisal of the Morrowwind theme. It's the Elder Scrolls them more then just Morrow-Wind.

Ballet FINISH go!
That seemed pretty, manly.
SB, inb4 thats waht yo look likes irl?
XD
wait!
sb, do the remics 10
So, this is where that AppleJack thing comes from.
Silver_Soother: and many more
I hate when firefox decides to not respond to my clicks
I keep hearing "Jack" instead of jab because of the AJ version :D
Vordox: I guess having prior knowledge of this game would help understand those then. Lol.
Nord) What happened to you gamers? It seems somewhere along the way, you turned from doing good and so now evil's holding sway. Rythim games and fitness games and even cooking sims! Gamer) What else are we to do?! Nord Fight the fight in ol' Skyrim!
Silver_Soother: I got more then prior knowledge. XD I tried to copy the code itself.
NewSuperBronyU: SEE SAW! aaaw
Vordox: xD Yeah, you got REAL close to it. :P
Is it weird, that when I see these, I got a nostalgia for the MLP version, and not the other way around?
Silver_Soother: You got a wii?
this one was also redone w/ a terraria theme as well
Vordox: I have one in the house, not mine though.
Silver_Soother: Older sibling or younger?
Currently younger, though they have NO games for it. Lol, it's kind of just sitting there at the moment.
Icant lok a t this game and not hink ponies
Silver_Soother: Get...THIS GAME! I got my Wii JUST for this game alone
Vordox: That's a pretty big recommendation.
Wii is now 130$
what a time to log in i gess
Silver_Soother: Where do you live?
hi naturesfury
Vordox: Illinois, why you ask?
Silver_Soother: The game has 3 official names
YES
SEE SAW
Vordox: Honestly it looks rather silly, but thats just my opinion
my favourite RIM <3
C SAW
DoctoDoctorWho: Looks silly? So shallow...
does this game have the multi player or was that only the japanese version NewSuperBronyU ?
jawohl
its AJ and RD!
Silver_Soother: The Japanese name is Rhythm Heaven Fever, in Jap it's Minna no Sengoku something.. And the EU version has a name I forgot(Beat system something)
I think the only other rhythm game I played besides guitar hero / rock band, was Elite Beat Agents on DS.
Silver_Soother: 3 totally differente gaames :P
I know right? xD
/me clicks. "ohai, swastika"
Still say this is the best one in years(Beat Agents is second)
NewSuperBronyU: Cheer Reeaaaders! 2 or 1! Or Remix 9!
I can see why I need to get this. Honestly; I can.
SB, ITS ALL UP TO YOU!
I am getting into the music, and I have never played teh game before. :)
I am the ONLY one who requested in 3 mintes

twilight_sprinkle: hey look..........books in the background

Silver_Soother XD danke

GAH
MONKEY WATCH
or rather rhythm would be a better term
twilight_sprinkle i love you
So, this is a remix of ALL the mini-games into one game? That's a lot of memorization to get through.
Silver_Soother: YOu have NO idea how long NewSuperBronyU tried to beat this

they say how much its gonna be?
How long are they going to keep making Wii games after Wii U is released?
free HDMI?
Tovler: Yes, free HDMI; worth the price right there. Easily.
oh pishaw
for shame
ps3 is still the most powerfull non PC console out there
backwards comp!
Calling Sony cheap, at least they give free games to PS Plus members, Xbox is cheap compared.
yes just not to ps2 :3 naturesfury
NewSuperBronyU: Marketing. :P
well nintento has never won any battles in power. and they knwo this
hmmm
that's wh ythey don't try to
That's less than 300!
There are enough tech specs out there, give me a reason to go out and buy the system by showing me the games, while playing dubstep or something hip.
pikmin?
Pikmin 3; MY reason to get Wii U.
same
Pikmin4lyf
I <3 me some Pikmin.
Animal Crossing Wii U will happen eventually.
Nintendo Land alpha!
someone buy NewSuperBronyU Pikmin 2.
nintendo is going the same route that xbox took in the last generation. that is why xbox has won this generation and ps2 won the last
the games
I still roll with my Gamecube. I may just play Pikmin 1 and 2 again soon. :3
at least Ubisoft picked up the slack.

oooooooooo, the Burns-omni-net episode
what a lame trip
I watch the simpsons on Pro7 at 18:10 german time everyday
nighty everypony
Geez, what time is it at your place?
Goodnight taoumi
11:49 german time
Well, same here
So you're at school?
:P
5:50am
I dunno
And how long?
On fridays there's simpsons marathon on Viasat 4 in Norway, for like..4-5 hours
I htink

2,14 well, that's a jab at my self esteem
Till october 20th
well, I like the simpsons
I like simpsons too
I love simpsons
Eh, I should just watch the stream <,<
Well im gonna go, its really early
Then i have to go to stupid school again >.<
Cya everypony
Cyah
Bye Pure-Style
I love quiet burns
Ah man, whenever I watch simpsons now, I hear the commentaries in my head

2,14 Spectrum_Rush: that's the joke. Every time they make him older and older
Yeah, it's great
Like the-- wood pressing of him scaring children
seems legit
ValtheJean: last time I watched the simpsons Burns was like 99 or something
didn't one episode say he was over 100
Did they ever state it?
2,14 it's one of the things they will never be consistant about
I think in one episode they said his age was his pin number
indeed val
Oh moe
I had that as a text message tone for a bit
I think MLP and Simpsons are two favourite animated series-
composition and timing- even if sometimes Simpsons is a bit heavy info and timing issues on certain jokes-
what is funny is that Burns is right on all counts
Hehe, yeah
Homer's lessons are the best. Trying is the first step to failure
lenny had a reign of terror?
take the money
and lisa prooves shes a dumbass
Hehehe
I'd take the money- try to make up for it
alexxm: with great power comes great resposibilty, with absolute power comes absolute corruption

AH man, Shoulda turned the stream on earlier. Made my morning

Ahh ponies
Pony insanity.
This was stuck in my head during last year's exams.
05morning
I can't remember where I first heard that song-
mornin Wrek
2,14 howdy wrek
Throughout the whole week, just ponies while I do essays, ponies while I do maths
I think it's stockmusic-? Or just similar?
05jsut got home from maria and i now have my superskråv :D
And good morning Wrek
05the ones over at fras are better but its too far away to walk in this weather
Wrek: good job! :D
sup Wrek
:O DVD?
Scootaloo grinds the sign
Wrek: dont know what any of that is so Imma gonna roll with it and say good job
it's movie time
Yay movie time
Oooooh
Ah itchy scratchy and poochy, inspired by..some guy who wanted new char in Simpsons?
2,14 different disk time*
It's one of them seasons DVDs

05is what it is
creepy marge
thats not werid
Damnit Wrek, I'm hungry
Hey everypony, dead chat?
Ohai DerpyMuffins
how are things DerpyMuffins
/me never tried walking down to that place
wow
you know those timers/
?
on the site
Ohai Phase4
on bronystate site?
ooo simpsons
Vivix, yeah
have you any idea how much work those do
PedoMoustache
noo- never thouht about it
it runs several hundred regex for some reason
o.O
yeah, i dont get it either
You could probably simplify it tons without getting more inaccurate-
oh ralph
Well everypony got to hit to bed see yall in the morning ok aight peace
Vivix, theres actually built in operations to do 99% of the work
and thus futurama was born
I'm not too familiar with timing, yet, but setInterval does the counting- but- I can't imagine it needing much more than that, and data
Lawyers<3
real show writers
Yeah,
David X Cohen is the guy with the squid, right?
no wait, he's later-
XD
cerburs
i can't spell that
Hehe
cerbrus
That is..george meyer?
That is David Silverman
with his tuba
2,14 needs to be about 10% rastafarian
Sunglasses
Metajoke
instant scrappy
lampshade hanging
Ah troy
shame phill hartman died
yeah-
damn cocaine wife
uh murdered
his wife shot him while high, I think
or stabbed him-
Dammit Homer
latter
Apparently she was clean, but some dirtbag hollywood dude got her back into it
i know the wife did it but not how
AH I love the animation episodes
so many injokes and--background people
2,14 bronies, learn from this scene
This is us 15 years from now
or--actually, already happened
...she is just a VA
2,14 treat our VAs well, please don't harass them
Homer..that hurt
burn
why would VAs know about how to beat the videogame
hehe, oh comic book guy
yeah, va's get asked craazy questions by nerds
dat cosplayer
just look at panels with The big bang theory
I guess Bronies are actually light in compare
2012, Season 3 of mlp!
Yeah, but- once we age as a fandom, we'll get trekkie grade nerds, I'm sure
2,14 vivix: >implying we already haven't
<,<
/me is a lore nerd deluxe
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
D=
/me kidnaps Jmo
Oi
what
Midge
What did Chrysalis say
/me slits Jmos throat
What Joke
ValtheJean: Im pretty sure we dont have trekkie grade nerds yet
2,14 we're getting close -_
2,14 -_-*
Yeah, we're getting there
DoctoDoctorWho, oh we actually have
it was bad and you should feel bad
hallo everypony
I like talking ad length about--lore implications by episodes, I'm pretty sure that's half trekkie
hey the kids wanted extreme
Oh brain
how are things LightTrooper105
I have told that to someone
2,14 the only difference is that we don't bug our VAs (yet) about the nerdy theories
doing fine alexxm and you?
...yet...
yeah, we shouldn't do that- if anything ,we should bug jayson
i'm good LightTrooper105
ValtheJean, we haven't?
Hehe, this is Simpson's writers response to Simpsons fans
2,14 but sending a god damn volume of a fanfiction to Tabitha is just as bad...hell it's even worse than trekkies
ValtheJean: I've heard of trekkie conventions where 2 fans who, under normal circumstances, liked eachother and would go out to date, instead reinacted the klingon mating dance.
Vivix whos jayson
Jayson Thiessen
oh ok
Showrunner and producer
basically doing what faust did before she quit
He's the lore god now-
ValtheJean, wait... what?
theres tabitha fanfiction?
Tabitha got FoE book as a gift
2,14 Phase4 you didn't know about that?
2,14 they sent her the fully printed volume of FoE to Tabitha
....
Oh, the finfic prints
why
2,14 because yeah, the VAs in the show want to see how we bastardize their hard work
i heard about that a while ago
For fun, I guess
FoE?
Phase4: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/09/tabithas-fallout-equestria-collection.html
2,14 Fallout Equestria
ah
who would thought that was a good idea
That was based on eh..that dude..
2,14 CrimsonPhoenix: I have no idea
still not as wierd as trekkies reinactiong the klingon mating dance...
I dunno, I think it was just some guy no affiliated with the printing
those lousey writers
I mean F:E might be decent and all but still.....
it's a videogame, show crossover
I love FoE, but- yeah, I don't she's gonna read it, but gifts are gifts
Phase4: I GIVE UP!
2,14 Vivix: there's a difference between gifts and self-serving ego rubs
Screw Haxe, Screw C#, Screw HTML5.
Of course, but it's not like it was sent by anyone involved in the printing
:(
Phase4: To Game Maker I go(Pre Load function with EASY use! And INSTANT live stream sounds!) Even if ALOT of people hate it..
I CAN MAKE IT
2,14 Doesn't excuse it
2,14 it's still despicable that we would flaunt that shit in the faces of people who put time and effort to bring us entertainment
Time to work overtime on Vector to Sprite. -.-
We didn't do anything, one guy did, I don't see why I should be annoyed at him
i have to go now, my planet needs me
BEST THING EVER
XD
Animation Cell visible
2,14 because it was on behalf of the fandom, regardless of whether you did it or not, someone is representing YOU in that way
Phase4: Very much :P
No, I don't feel represented by the actions of others-
i have to go now my planet needs me
Dat "YOU" :<
2,14 well that's great that you don't feel that way, it doesn't change how the people who work on the show are being exposed to the fandom
No, of course not, but she has a choise not to read it, and she probably won't
2,14 it doesn't matter if she reads it, the point is that we SENT it to her in the first place
Chances are she'll be gardening instead
I don't really see why that matters to anyone
I hardly think any of the VA's care
I HEAR MITTENNACHT! <3
woot 4 mitternacht!
<--- Why is MLP so awesome looking...
ValtheJean: Is there some lag?
Animators and storyboards <3
ValtheJean, what's the reference in this video?
Only discord would know how to speak germen
2,14 reference? It's a PMV...
well the music then
damn german discord is awesome
2,14 Mitternacht
CrimsonPhoenix: Miternacht means midnight in german
ValtheJean: *Snicker* But do you know there's a slight sound lag? Or visual lag? It's minor but meh :P
heh....fitting
2,14 Vordox: that happens to pretty much everyone's streams
2,14 that's just how it works
ValtheJean: :( Damnit Stream. Well, still great stream and community
Thank you ValtheJean <3
Vordox, what sound lag, visual lag?
du hosty
lag the video to compensate, dunno if that's suppoted in the capture software though
CrimsonPhoenix: Some sound/visual lag making it unsync(The eye of a game designer)
i want everyone here to know, that i love ValtheJean
Germans sound perpetually angry, I wonder why.
GO go Octi!
DoctoDoctorWho: Nah. :P
2,14 the desynch is caused by how the machine communicates with the server, which then communicates with our embed
IN A SFW kinda way :3
DoctoDoctorWho: You should hear ENGLISH people!
2,14 it's unavoidable
I've talked to two germans in real life, one sounded super nice and sweet, other sounded REALLY angry
ValtheJean: And the signal from visual and sound are 2 complete different channels. Eeyup
there are a lot of strong K sounds
2,14 You can stop sucking up to me Lyra`, I'm not going to ban you unless you break a rule
I don't really see any desync on my end
who's sucking up :3
ValtheJean, oh she's just being Lyra` :P
Hai random Scootaloo?
2,14 If I had a nickel for every time I heard that...
someone must have put a 'want it need it' spell on you babe~
Phase4: Currently going through every code in my head, I'll try and make a quick demo within this month.
who else
Phase4: We'll see how that goes. :P Shame only PC users can play it though
wants/needs ValtheJean?
Vordox, yeah, maybe it can be ported later though
We'll see.
Oh lawl
dat aol
<--- Also that load
Vordox: are you saying the english language sounds angry?
DoctoDoctorWho: The British ones sounds... Well mot angry, but sOMETHING. :P
ah old timey AOL
You know what language sounds the copmlete opposite to angry? Swedish
can I put in a request for the next episode after this one?
AOL still in business?
everyone dies
ok that's impossible
it lives
Phase4: Also.. You knwo something fun?
Vordox, yeah?
ahaha
Phase4: I just checked the price tags on people with games from USA, Sweden and Australia...
USa gets is SHIT cheap...
Compared to anyone else
Vordox, ikr
And funnily, they are complaining the most. :P
ikr
Vordox: British accents sound silly to non brits
Everything in USA is cheap- even vintage instruments
2,14 Vordox: that's because most of the companies are IN the US
DoctoDoctorWho: Sounds weird, but aawesome. :P
2,14 not having to pay exporting costs goes a long way
ValtheJean, but what about digital games?
Food, instruments, cars- houses--
ValtheJean: Japan stuff cheaper in USA. :P
ValtheJean: Just compare the price of RE6 in all euroapan places.
2,14 most of those companies are based in US
kinda cookie and fun :D
2,14 as for Digital, you got me
ValtheJean, yeah, steam prices are higher here
no aparent reason
the price of games doesn't translate at all
compleate with dead midget
Okay, let's be honest here now ValtheJean, In Sweden the RE6 cost 699 Kronor(SEK)
In USA it costs...
(If you compare the 699 to Dollars)
they get the US $ price and just apply it to other currency without converting it
104,27 Dollar
2,14 Which I have no idea how much that's worth in $
Do you PAY that much for RE6?
2,14 to be fair
Discombobulator
2,14 a lot of european countries have rediculous gaming regulations
And in Australia, 699 SEK is 101,94 Aus
Do you PAY that much, Phase4 ?
2,14 and so companies have to make separate euro versions for some games
but it's not just games
dat pin pals
it's most things
lololol
pretty sure the price stuff is just laziness
Australian Game prices
ahahah
^
oof
AUS prices..you poor poor man Jmo
continuity nod
Vordox, thats why i can't buy new games
Watta joke
and that fact that they can get away with it
palpate for TIC :3
Phase4: It costs that much? O.o Over 100 Aus?
Vordox, usually 80 to 100
a lot of games get released at 120AUD
Anyway, next time I see someone complain about EXPENSIVE games, I'll slap 'em .:P
rawr~
AdamTheDuck: Then I can feel for you guys too
But next time... *SLAP* the spoiled people =P
Indeed
that is why a lot of stuff is region locked to keep you from importing the stuff youself for a lower price
ahaha
hes a homosexual :D
This episode had 2 pages of Do not refer to, and not suitable for broadcasting
when Fox changed managemenet, it got a one page note that said "Suitable for broadcasting."

Hehe, oh parodies
I hope MLP never hits this level of parodies, but for simpsons, it's perfect
Phase4: Got a little problem with Flash CS3 in Wine. When I move with one of the side bars, it goes black and I can't see or do anything with it. Any idea where the problem might be?
Malavolent, http://derpy.me/raR4O
Malavolent, you using compiz?
...the Big Lebowski parody was pretty blatant.
wait... you said ubuntu so yes
2,14 Phase4: y u post non-image links! ;_;

Have fun Crimson
Oh, the Flash 8 has platinum rating. Looks like I'll go for it.
Anyway, thanks Phase4 :)
Malavolent, np ^_^
Bye CrimsonPhoenix
always check the wine appdb, its got a huge ammount of info
I need to learn how to use Flash one of these days
Phase4: I've already checked the wine page but I haven't found this exact page.
Phase4: By the way, any advice for newbie using Ubuntu?
I loove that guy
Oh Ubuntu
How fun that OS is
Jmo: Sure. Fuun.
ikr :P
is red hat and mandrake still alive?
I remember my first time using it, all of my wat.
are*
Malavolent, ubuntu's internals are a mess and all written in python, if you want to learn more about computers go download arch, as a user though stick around the fourms
Vivix, yeah, they sell things somehow and people buy them for some reason
waat? Oh right- they went money
Phase4: So basically Arch is better for me?
I kinda want to mess with linux again, but--I dunno what's going on anymore
red hat sells suport for red hat linux afaik
Oh okay
I also don't know what I'd do in linux, I'm not doing much...computery things, other than drawroom project
Malavolent, if you want to learn more then yeah, stat it in a vm though, its not beginer friendly
Run
My digital technology teacher explaining how all the computer components work together with eachother today. It would have been better if she just said "it's all just a bunch of wibbly wobbly timey whimey... stuff", because she was barely making sense.
Hehe
: |
most high school teachers don't actually know what they're talking about
whimey?
I'm disappoint.
computer teachers i mene
Phase4: Okay, I'll have to get used to the ubuntu first.
Phase4: It's true
My first computer teacher in primary school was a 20 yearold DnD and Larpa playing woman who rode horses
She was awesome
>.>
Vivix had a crush on his teaaacher~
nuuuuh, too young to cruush
Ahahaha
Vivix, why couldnt she have been my teacher, mine thought ms frontpage was an ide
lol
She was just cool, I thoguht DnD was the coolest thing ever at the time
Hehehe
at the time? i was not aware DnD stopped being cool
^
Well, it's still awesome, but I have noone to play with
Phase4: She was naming ram in gigs, instead of megabytes. >mfw she says 64 gigs of ram is dirt cheap nowadays compared to back 'then'
2,14 all the cool hoes be playin with dnd swagh
Phase4: Wish I could play DnD with someone.
I'll play with you Veveex~
:>
we played wiht my cousins friends, way older than me, but most amazing DM ever, was like listenign to an actor
ValtheJean: All the cool kids play DnD.
He never said numbers, he just --vivid descriptions and and fun
yeah, really need a good dm for it to work
Yeah, it was great, I kinda want to play MUD's--just to--hang out and RP, but- they're almost all dead and weird
DM is--Crucial
2,14 oh that reminds me of something...
lol
We need a modern version of MuD- using email to create a character is <,<..

Aight sorry, I'm back.

Bai Panda
Just watched a quick gameplay of War Z...
Is it the stick up the ass running?
Ehh...
who likes me?
/me likes applejack`
:))
They copied the ToS from LoL, they've copied lots of stuff from games, they created one of the worst games in history (Big Rigs)
And they've lied about their history.
Also I bludgeoned a dude with my flash light yesterday just to get binoculars in war z
Bye Panda|DrawingandStuf
And I stole his food and water.
They say they have worked on several games, but there is no proof.
though... all the applejack fanart ive done was of suggestive material....
Emotion is good, suggestive is emotion in some form
I regret funding them.
Sylandest!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Panda|DrawingandStuf: morning, panda
/me glomps the shit out of Sylandest
and morning, everypony :)

Bollocks to you.
Party smooth.
Sylandest of course :3 he challenged me to a drinking game though. He lost so we walked home and I hopped on IRC and incoherent chat was everywhere. Deathstar got a kick out of it though XD

Sylandest, how did midnot hold up last night? I see he got good with fiddle... that rat bastard.
Oh... War Z isn't gearing towards being a simulator... It's more like an rpg...
Panda|DrawingandStuf: he managed fine. I sent him to bed straight away though. He was exhausted.
/me looks at PONYPOWER
/me saids: OH NO HE KNOWS
/me quits

/me actually kills my Pc
Sylandest, well midnot was feeling down so I thought of something to cheer him up
/me is not me hes a spy
Panda|DrawingandStuf: Ahhh, right, I saw that. Its a good idea :)
sounds like something a spy would say.
Sylandest, so school today?
Lyra`!!!!
Yeah... I don't think I would like War Z... :/
/me glomps Lyra`
Panda|DrawingandStuf: I have school. And midnight does too. But when he finishes, I'm sure he'll appreciate the distraction

/me glomps the shit out of Twi_Fi
TWILLY!
Hello Panda|DrawingandStuf.
Sox are cool
SO KEWL
Twi_Fi ;A; haven't talked to you in a long while. How have you been hun?
Panda|DrawingandStuf: I've been okay.
Panda|DrawingandStuf: percent of fragmenting my disk: 84%
:C
Twi_Fi, just ok? :/ nothing spectacular?
Rarely is life spectacular.
applejack` pft, needs to be about 20% cooler
Twi_Fi, yup, thats adulthood for you.
Unfortunately.
/me is 21% uncooler
How have you been, Panda|DrawingandStuf?
http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/356/570/73e.jpg --- sooooo true :)
Rofl
Twi_Fi, I've been well, just work and school for me. Still trying to master art... though its ever so fleeting.
so true so true
So someo ne here has kidnapped the streamers.
Vivix did.
I mean, why else would there be no stream?
WAT
Well
?
Where are they?
Eh
not in my bed
Liar.
Barbetos: I have taken them as part of my master plan for more AJ. You cannot stop me!
Honest!
/me is in bad touch.
They're in the basement
Vivix aw you have the best parties.
y u no invite me
Hehe
/me is in bad touch cause GERMANY wont get seasone 2.
Cuz..cuz they private parties
/me not bronystate mod
Racists!
=P
Sylandest, why do you and Sumi love her so much...
Aww Yeaah
Only horses are invited to my parties
Panda|DrawingandStuf: because AJ is awesome. Nuf said
Sylandest AJIsAwesome|Asleep?
>.>
Panda|DrawingandStuf: Yes, that AJ, and all other AJ nicknames, and Applejack especially herself
AJ is pretty cool
She is currently my favorite pony.
;#
;3
PFT
Well its true
Rarity was my first though
And that sounds wrong
She's everyones first..
Or right to some people.
and screw you Sylandest and our friendship! I now have... 30 drawigns of AJ and only 6 of Rarity .__.
Hehe, I think my first fav pony was Fluttershy
now its Fluttershy Rarity and Pinkie in a mix-
p4ngya: hehehe, behold her power!
her
Fluttershy has never been favorite pony for me
* Panda|DrawingandStuf
watever
/me loved Rarity before it was cool.
I just don't buy into her cuteness for some reason
She fits me so well, her faults and such remind me of me
Shy girls turn me off I guess.
I can see that-
>_>
yeah, everyones different in that, I more relate to her than attract to her I guess
I dated someone like fluttershy... only thing good about it was... well... nvm
You all like ponies
Gaaay
Kinda like--before I started working--in 2008, I didn't go outside for abot 2 years I think
Jaymoo pls, you leik teh poniez too
my girl is shy and i think its really cute i am really good with people and she gets really scared with new people so i have to be with her if she goes to meet someone :)
Jmo is not gaay ;__; s equinophile
I have to have someone with me when I go to new places
or don't know how to get back home
Panda|DrawingandStuf See I did that too. I dated a chick that was really shy, and well, it just got annoying
Rofl
So I think it reflects in my feelings for Fluttershy
You have no proof
Thanks <3
Could be
!
Vivix Shut it.
>>>
nuh!
FUK IT
but I am pretty sure if I got stuck in a room with an obnoxious girl (RD) I probably would like fluttershy more
but, Shy is not the same as anxiety issues
and I think fluttershy is more anxiety ish than shy at some points
You know when she was afraid to tell her friends she couldn't go see the dragon, a very real issue sometimes
Oh great.
Coffee on my pants
You can't tell anyone no, in case they reject you because of it, so you say yes. maybe, and avoid and lie
Yes I am really ReALLY happy to see you. o_o
my girlfriend reminds me of fluttershy sometimes its really cute :)
gag me
Sorry I just.
Yeah
wut.
Wat
That would be annoying to me
Shy girlfriend ruined it for me
or ex I should say
yeah
Poor fluttershy has to get my flutterhate becuase of it.
TAINT FaIR
It's not a bad thing that you don't like it- its just how it is
Want a tissue diddums?
Barbetos... well, as they say, the shy quiet ones are best in bed.
Vivix I really dislike it, yeah. Hate is not the right word. I just have other internalized issues: I don't like a pony? wut?
It freaks me out
Don't judge me
I am odd and I know it
Hehe
We're all odd in some places
Yo everypony!
Expecially you.
Vivix you especially~
OH SNAP
Oh I'm freaked out
Jmo /)
Hehe
(\
I am very odd- and have a lot of hangups, but that's fiiiiiiine *twilight grin*
/me shivers
YOLO

SWAG
NAILED IT

What do you like in a bug?
School, bye.
Not a pervy joke, just btw
Concentration :D
So don't do it.
And here I come learning about an utter bugfuck insane Japanese RPG... why do I always end up looking those up :D
I'm not sure- I kinda like moth's
Hehe
I dunno, I like how some bugs look, but others just freak me out. Like spiders
Spiders are cool
But they freak me out
Yeah
My brain confuses me
Want to trade?
Nah
It is a woman
It has a sexy voice
It also has a plethora of useless information, and knows enough IT to get by.
Hmm
Well, mines..eh

Not TOO weird- I guesss

What?
Just Cuase 2?

MadSurge: No you don't
this has been best illegal roleplay on this channel ever. *bows*
*fire fire fire*
illegal?
/me crawls around the chat as a fluffy thing
/me glomps ASoftFluffyThing
All the best things are "illegal"
FLUFFEH~
/me steps on ASoftFluffyThing
according to some people yes...
such as "arsony" and "theft" and "rape"
Oi.
Keep that shit out of here.
Ok I can understand that last one
actually, all three :[
RAEP
arson in TF2 is okay though. as long as you're not burning me.
/me squeaks loudly and whines from under Hoody|School's foot
o.o
An eye patch
/me steps on Hoody|School
/me steps on Hoody's school. Macro! XD
We had a poll sort of thing about a few years back at my old school to see what kind of criminal everybody would be, and I was the only person who got arsonist :I
:O
/me 08,01dubsteps on Kurra
/me trips over Kurra
Did anyone get Ponzi scheme mastermind at your school?
5 people got rapist
/me hears dubstep and dies
ewwww
08,01what the fuck kind of school tells you you're going to be a rapist?
and almost all of my friends got serial killer
08,01that's not exactly something to aspire to
Low standards
08,01oh
Ok kids, now this is what we call a roofie
And I aspire to be the best pyro I can be
08,01also, my new favourite way of load testing servers:
I want one!
Burrrn baby burn, disco inferno-oo... o/~
08,01for cpu in 1 2 3 4; do while true; do foo=1; done & done
Play that funky music, white boy~
why not just enter yes
I'm being stepped on because Hoody|School doesn't like fluffy things :I
yes
fluffy ftw
we should have a rule
ASoftFluffyThing: I have a fluffy rodent ;~;
08,01speaking of servers, time for me to shut this one off
anytime someone says yes alone, we all loadtest the chat by replying y.
Hoody|School, but why you step on me ;A;
ASoftFluffyThing: I didn't see you down there ;~;
MY EYES
MY LEG
Hoody|School, I'm a light blue fluffy thing. How can you not see me?
ASoftFluffyThing: Well, I'm wearing my new shades
and im tired
And I got a NEW HOODY!
*cheering*
/me claps
I want all the things
Dr_Fumbles: You can have ONE thing
:'( fine...
Giant squishy potatoes
I want purple
/me jumps in a washing mashine and puts it on for 10 minutes in cold water
Sanic says that's no good
ASoftFluffyThing: NOOOOOO
NOT THE COLD WATER
HAve fun having a cold
Artificial white water rapids!
Why do the fluffy die young :'(
:D OH LAWD
/me impossibly fits a tandem kayak in there
/me sits in Kurra's lap
hello everypony

Magic: Hello
/me takes a GoPro camera and films like you'd see in an REI commercial... if REI made commercials.
/me jumps out the washer and hops in the dryer for an hour
Hoody|School o.o;
08,01i have a clamp meter on my server now! \o/
/me impossibly fits a Range Rover special rally edition into the dryer
I dont know what that is!
/me nods and pretends to know what that is
Dakar Rally championship!
has anypony heard of the exact date for season 3 yet?:$
/me drives the dryer to a dump
i think november me laddy
sometime in November
/me goes over dunes and bumps in the heat at breakneck speed
08,01a clamp meter is a meter that senses electricity, usually current, but sometimes voltage too
is the rumor true?
I really should have known that...
Yes, Magic Johnson doesn't really have aids
/me climbs out of the dryer all clean
08,01it does it by putting a clamp around the wire, instead of being physically attached to the circuit
On Ponygoons a contest for the Stare Masters gangtag has just finished, and the recurring gag was that the Rainbow Racers never got their turn :D Now that they're the only group left, we can choose to shut down the contests :D worst ponies GETS NOTHING! SHE LOSES!
ha ha
08,01hey ASoftFluffyThing!
wat.
MadSurge: Get out of my drugs!
I wonder if control codes are allowed here
i meant season 3 bein the end
Herp
I guess not
Magic: there's already plans for season 4 it seems
08,01Magic: no, season 2 was the end
cause if so it will tear my heart
08,01season 3 will never exist
^
:O
^
Later gotta go
