07,1I just need to fix the sound in a bit
Yeah, the dolls are the best part of the act. xD
07,1it's derping a bit
06,15The puppet part is awesome.
That puppet looks like my dad.
Walter is awesoe
awesome*
07,1rofl
lol
06,15Oprah is a man, true.
OPRAH

LMOA

06,15Refreshing stream so I'm not behind, lawl

sry
Same
The stream is perfect for me.

06,15Well, no stuttering or anything

07,1well Zep nothing I can do about that
Kenny just got lilled.Lmao

I know you cant, I think this stream rocks either way
^^
07,1huzzah

LOL KENNY
You guys were right,he's hilarious.
07,1you can thank my bf later..
07,1he wanted to see this
Thanks Luna's bf
07,1he suggested to stream it
Hey luckiest-guy-in-the-world, if you're reading this, thx! =d
WE LOVE IT HERE!!!!
lol
07,1lol he's laughing
Oh lol
http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/molestia
06,15Well, I guess he's reading this so thanks!
It actually is a word
07,1he is, yes
Afk
/me loves it here
I feel like Minecraft now.
07,1you should watch the stream >.>
06,15So "molestia" is latin for annoyance or trouble, I guess...
/me agrees with Veewave.
EE-yup
06,15Well, that does fit!
xD
I should watch the stream?
06,15She is like a constant source of trouble
This is so great
07,1lol Walter is epic
06,15You should, if you like Jeff Dunham, Rainbow-Dash
lol poor kid
07,1and if you don't you should still watch
07,1cause it's awesome
06,15or if you have no idea who it is, you should watch :P
It is pretty awesome.. But I have stuff to do D:
Bwahaha
06,15Basically, you should watch the stream, is the point. :P
Love this part.
lol
06,15Can you explode twice?
By the way, Luna, do you have any numbers on people connected(rather than people on chat)?
Maybe if you concentrate hard enough RobotPinkie
Lol
/me can explode twice
For example, we hit over 1500 bronies yesterday, but those were only on chat
probably at least 3000 on stream
07,1yea. we are getting bigger :)
I thought about something the other day.
07,1but still need more bronies!
06,15Yeah, pretty much. A whole lot of people.
Oh I love Jeff Dunham so much
Luna, I take it you are not using Google Analytics or something like that to keep count?
ahaha lol
What if we streamed Pinkie Quest, when we had over a thousand bronies.
woudl be nice if the stream plugin showed the number of conections imo
Zephirdd: You can actually...
06,15Then the internet would spontaneously combust, LunaTheForgotten
07,1nope, not at this point
lol april fools
Not directly from the embed
@LunaTheForgotten They would probably enjoy that.
07,1we just want to be known in thebrony community
Luna: You might want to look into setting it up at somepoint
Yeah I guess That would happen RobotPinkie
Stats are always nice :3
Oh, but you are! :O
You are very well known
06,15Seems likely anyway :P
07,1sure, your free to do what-ever you want :) it's your DA after-all
As in not spamming people but post a nice image of something about BronyState
Have been trying to convince people to join myself. :P
:)
lmao this is too goodf
This is sooooo epic.
Oh my god, I love this puppet (I forget his name, someone help me out)
Walter
Walter
06,15Haha :D
Ah, I remember now
He's probably my favorite or second favorite.
Ackhmed is awesome too
LOL
/me is laughing his head off

06,15I LOVE ponies

ChatZilla > embed chats

Don't do it! It's a trap!

It's not you!
06,15yeah don't do that just because I'm not enjoying it, people are watching
I however would prefer something funnier
^I agree with myself
06,15Just stating my preference :P
07,1Just makes me wonder... if he's gay or not
Me too. He needs to get all this from SOMEWHERE.

Okee
07,1So the question is: Is Tosh gay or not?
Probably.
I don't even care...
07,1His show on comedy central sucks...
I think most of his stuff Like this right now is either hit or miss at humor
He does a lot of that sort of bashing.
somtimes hes hilarious right now its pretty bad
07,1yea, I think so too
Luna, I'm gonna try mIRC
07,1sure
I downloaded it to my flash drive
Yeah. His TV stuff is the same, but I generally find it worse
mIRC is pretty good when you change the font to something not hideous
/me pokes Silvermane
so many people bash the amish lulz
07,1indeed
Oh I have to PAY for mIRC?
Nevermind that.
08,120 dollars

08,1it's not too bad
I've had mIRC for years and never paid.
You don't reeeealy have to
2,14 it's only a guilt screen
BUTTER!
2,14 you never have to actually buy it
It'll ask you to, then let you keep using it anyways.
08,1oh really?
Yup
2,14 it's like winrar

07,1twice
07,1:D
OH NO
08,1lol Luna
When 30 days is up, it asks you to please pay, then lets you keep using it.
lol thats like 5 clicks, I had that for 3 years even though I was supposed to get 30 says, it finally ran out though
Oh
So yeah, don't have to bother paying.

Well, you can have VLC capture your current screen and rebroadcast it
1.8 made it lag for me
because of the multiple streams?
Discord
thats one reason why people stopped playing as it fucks up minecrafts fps
I should put up my Server and everyone should join
that's reason enough
Minecrat Server
Well, it doesn't help that he's three streams deep into streamception.
/me gives standing ovation(sp?)!
07,1YAY!!
07,1Alright FLUTTERSHY
Louder!

Dat Model
they eyes look different
trying to add some animation for walking and such?
how do we stream?
06,15He's trying to animate her, I'm pretty sure he said.
06,15Rigging is the hardest part
indeed it is
unless
07,1omg!
07,1she's naked!
you have autoriggin software
07,1don't tell anyone!
naked ponies?!?
Technically...
Razor used
Ponies are naked all the time
never heard of those 2 words used in the same sentence before!?
It would be odder to see them wearing clothes IMO
06,15Autorigging doesn't work very well in Blender
/me is sad
it works fairly well in 3Ds max for me
Ha, that's like the only one I have memorized
/me is cupcakes
not sure about Maya though
06,15Also you still have to fiddle with constraints quite a bit.
2,14 that's cause 3ds Max > All :P
or Cinema 4D
which I JUST GOT!
GMAX lol I used that way back in the day
I dont think anyone uses that anymore
/me is happy!
06,15Oh lawd Val is in trollan overload mode
2,14 >yfw I'm dead serious
I have to use 3Ds Max 8 at my school
Which cursor set is that streamer using?
Twilight's in the box. :o
Twilight Squish! 5 bucks the gallon
06,15Oh you THINK you're right, no doubt. :P
o_o
06,15Not everyone wants to pirate expensive software, though.
2,14 Yeah, except I own it legally
lol
is Blender any good?
2,14 so you can go suck your tits
O.o
God help us all
ANGRY PEOPLE ARE ANGRY

What does it mean?!?
06,15Go suck your own tits, I can't afford that kind of software :P

07,1guys what am I reading here... >.<
i love to pirate expensive software!

2,14 wow your fail
06,15>you're
Pirating = 100% malware
06,15Nice job
07,1nope
Wait... What's going on here?

07,1depends on where you get it from :)
2,14 >Implying typos on the internet aren't common

06,15lolololol
RobotPinkie

Anyone here know where I can watch MLP is anything above 480p?

/me vanishes for a while
ponyarchive.org
/me streamed 1080p last night
Woo. Thanks. I must've used the wrong search words...
2,14 heh....hehe
06,15lol Val, Blender used to be proprietary.
I was playing Magic all of last night. I was busy unfortunately.
2,14 1080p....violet...violet did you hear that!
06,15It gets a fair amount of funding, too
/me is in a Trance do to Fluttershy`'s voice
2,14 our meme lives on!
2,14 and yet it still fails :P
06,15Yeah, it's not 3DS Max, but who cares?
I SHALL BE GOING, But i shall be back laterz
(O_O)/"
Well
06,15It's a great program, very fast to use, great features especially for making game models.

2,14 oh, I'm enjoying this more than most topics. You seem to be experiencing the emotion known as anger
06,15People like different things, it's no big deal
I think she's physically incapable of Flutterbitch >.>
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieMIJpVImww
/me is enjoying the mod argument

YAY I got irc to work
dat leafeon background...
Leafeon <3 Fluttershy`
i prefer Umbreon to be honest
2,14 I'm only picking up on the hypocrisy of on one hand saying everyone is entitled to an opinion, and then rushing to the defense of something when one expresses said opinion :P
Ah made it Mahself
2,14 but who knows? Perhaps this is just revenge for the incessant Caramel trolling everyone seems to take so much pleasure in
06,15No, I'm saying you're entitled to prefer whatever you prefer, not saying you're entitled to think everyone else is wrong for disagreeing, Val. Big difference.
DESKTOP PONIES!
DO DESKTOP PONY HOOFBALL!

I get it
So...this anime. its about a high school where all the students fight in over the top mecha for something called a glittering crux?
its something sexual right?
I wonder if causing earthquakes are against my school's rules.
right?
And the mechs are powered by Libido.
06,15So what are we watching?
06,15Something about squids, that much I can tell
Monochrome time!

Sorry to howevers streaming, if it sounds like we're bashing it

No worrys here lag
Anime Cliché nr 0005 when in doubt add mechas
The comments are amusing.
06,15What show is it?
Persona!
The way this girl loses her fight against Caramel is hilarious.
so the mecha are powered by sex drive?
no it's StarDrive
"I'm bored. Time for a mech fight. :p"
06,15StarDrive? Oh okay
Yes TheMaster
Meches with ineffecient joints and builds

I'll be lurking here and there
Just wait.
06,15Later, AllisZero
thouse Shoulder Joints are too flimsy
06,15and I guess that guy just went half-saiyan
So do they go into some alt universe to fight? Dyssidia style?
wait...does that robot have a boner?
The rest of the Glittering Crux is embarrased at how she loses this fight.
even their Mechs are anorexic
Roboner.
IT DOES
06,15I have the wingest boner right now....
Dude SPOILER°
!
moar of dat underboob...

06,15I have no idea...
lol
How old is this anime?
-06 I'd say
1 year?
Dis is StarDrive
The anime is StarDriver
mid 2010
It ran for one year, ended last year.
What episode?
5 going on 6
Sweet, I haven't missed much
does it have a conclusion?
Yes
and thus it ends in pedo
So was it meant to be a series or just a oneshot?
08,1o_o
08,1what the hell?
08,1did we just watch?
It's a series.
Oh Hi Fluttershy`
It's a single season show though.
08,1....
rape, we watched rape
2,14 I think this show pretty much just says everything we're already thinking about Japan...
Was it supposed to get a second?
SEX MECHS AND MORE SEX!
^
I would /hope/ not, everything pretty much got resolved at the end of the series.
It might get a movie ending
06,15No, that's Koi Koi 7 you're thinking about, ValtheJean :P
08,1we watched....
08,1FANSERVICE
I read that as Sex Mex...
/me has no idea what that is, but doesn't want to :P
The japanese seem to only to be able to express their interest in sex through giant robots.
06,15I couldn't watch more than an episode of that crap, wow...
but thats okay, because its awesome
I dot want to finish this taco anymore...
Mechs are the epitome of Sex
Yay music
Caramel is dazzling the stage.
so this was the 5th episode?
06,15What was that a trailer for?
yup
question answered
06,15That other show looks really good....
I can't watch anything without seeing references to dr.who
it was a movie
like that watch
06,15What movie, though?
what does that mean? your galaxy will shine? is he coming on to us
*shrug* You have a bigger view of the show then I do.
What says "I love you" more than a giant robot?
atleast they arn't talking about drills
06,15Ah, damn...
thats a bit more phallic
yeah but this one has the "kings pillar"
Drills are the manliest weapon on a robot
Well Veewave, Chicks dig giant robots
Inorite?
That and Giant Guns
Spiral power shall fight the powa
Pow pow

Sumica: When are you going to do the next two Star Driver episodes?
/me hugs NewDCD
Stop making me love you D:
Magneto is best pony
9 also my estimated arrival time for my Shin Ichigo Figuarts is September 30..in USA...and then I got to wait for the Miami-to-Panama shipping
AMAZON GO FASTER PLEASE ;___;
Magnanimous is awesome pony.
probly not till next weekend, have swing shift all this week.
9 inb4 Skyrider I AM AMAZAWN
Fair enough.
9 also sup Nat
Hiya DCD :3
/me glomps NewDCD
2,14 out of curiosity, is Star Driver in any of the SRW's?
ValtheJean: No.
too new
9 Val: Star Driver is 2010
9 most people quote a 3-year rule for SRW
9 but in truth it isn't so
2,14 "convert the driver's libido into energy" what the fuck?
9 in the end they just fit new series to any SRW that can fit it
There's also the licensing issues.
9 enough time after the series have aired so it doesn't spoil so bad
DCD IS BACK BEEEYAAATCH!
9 not to mention the fact that games like SRW take a hefty amount of time to develop
9 technically I should be working on my Les Mis project...been procrastinating all day, due tomorrow with a speech as well...and gotta study biostatistics to boot
9 but meh
Star Driver might not get into a SRW game until what, 2014 or so?
9 I'm just not into my game
2,14 lol
9 Espy: I could predict it being as soon as late 2012
9 but so far they haven't even announced Z2-2 and I doubt they'll add new series in Z2-2
9 the roster is already jam-packed enough. They'll just give us awesome unit upgrades
2,14 like more veritechs? :D
9>inb4 Star Driver actually makes it to Z2-2 and we get TENGEN TOPPA TAUBURN
I'm still waiting for them to add Megas.
^Oh lord.
2,14 I think the SDF-1 should come back, because I want it in with Dai-Guard and Big-O :P
/me 8has lost track of the conversation.
9 It won't be in this game. It's impossiburu
^
But the SDF1 is part of a city now
2,14 yeah I know :P
9 We talking about giant robots yaw
2,14 but it deserves more than just the GBA game :P
9 It'd be cool if we got Macross 7
/me has done the same, all he see's in chat is green and grey highlight...
9 If just for FUCKING MAX JENIUS: PERFECT PARENT
hell you might as well ask for the Big Road
/me really should download that ROM, just for having the Skull Squad
2,14 or was it wolf?
2,14 I can't remember
what are we talking about? Whats SWR?
Super Robot Wars.
9 SRW= Super Robot Wars
2,14 SRW is Super Robot Wars
star wars republic?
2,14 basically, an RPG with every giant robot anime
so ive heard
never actuall played it...
2,14 just watch when DCD streams it sometime :P
2,14 you wont regret it
an RPG with every giant robot anime? This is relevant to my interests
So what is it the SSB of giant robots?
2,14 tis awesome apokalipse
9Lagmobile: pretty much
does it have gundam 08th ms team?
9 DAMMIT ARRIVE ALREADY ;___; http://www.amazon.com/Bandai-Kamen-Rider-Shin-Ichigo/dp/B004UPIOMC/ref=pd_sbs_t3
hi?
yo
9ctrlx: AFAIK the only one with 08th MS is A Portable. Which I own.
long japanese name
Hi Kencolt
It looked more like a turn based strategy game.
2,14 it's a turn based RPG
9 I was debating whether streaming A Portable or MX after Z2
9 since we're really close to endgame
2,14 not sure what any of those other than Z2 are :P
What systems again? Might find some roms...
Does the endgame have Anti-Spirals?
9 but guess what
9 you get to choose
9 Espy: this is Z2-1. It will end with the LordGenome battle for the GL-plot
9 and will wrap up Geass S1 and Gundam 00 S1
9 basically all series which can be divided in parts will have half the plot done by the endgame
9 No news yet on the release dates for Saisei-hen though
7 years of bad spy luck...
9Also you guys get to choose the next SRW:
http://www.giantbomb.com/super-robot-wars-mx/61-22584/
http://www.giantbomb.com/super-robot-wars-a-portable/61-22178/
2,14 I vote the GBA one with SDF-1 :P
9There is no GBA one with that
oh yeah Alpha Gaiden is an option too
a sec
I'm picking MX at random.
2,14 wait...I thought there was...
/me gives up, lays down on the ground, and puts a paper bag over her head. "So long and thanks for all the fish...."
http://imgur.com/gallery/Jw2Oc
9http://www.giantbomb.com/super-robot-wars-alpha-gaiden/61-22662/ choice number 3. This is the only one that has english.
hey fluttershy
/me turns int a tree
what did you think of the session yesterday?
*into
2,14 I VOTE ALPHA GAIDEN
OH god the session
So much alcohol.
g2g guys
c ya later
Bye Lagmobile!
/me hugs Lagmobile
9 One vote for Alpha Gaiden
9I was gravitating for MX though, because EVA units would draw a lot of people to SRW
bye Lagmobile
2,14 lol, then go with that if you want :P
^
9 I'm putting it for votin'
9 BUT ONLY VAL SEEMS TO VOTE
eva sounds good
/me votes for eva
MX!
I realy dont know one from another
Is it true if you level Unit-01 right he can hold off half the enemy fleet in endgame?
9 Also there's a reason I don't want to stream a full playthrough for Alpha Gaiden
I vote MX :<
9 It's the only one in English
9 I'd like people to go play it themselves
9It's a great way to get familiarized with SRW
2,14 :P
9I might sample a few stages but that's it
TROMBE~!
well take care guys i guess i'm going to sleep
9MAYBE IF I POST THIS LINK ENOUGH TIMES IT WILL GET HERE SOONER ;__________; http://www.amazon.com/Bandai-Kamen-Rider-Shin-Ichigo/dp/B004UPIOMC/ref=pd_sbs_t3
RIDER KICK!

Nite Meteor
9 i DON'T GET MAIL
/me hugs MeteorVenture
Sleep well~
9 and I guess MX it is
06,15Hardest part of Splinter Cell: Done. All in a day's work.

brohoof's all around!
Yay, my vote wins~
Bye MeteorVenture
06,15Night MeteorVenture
/me brohoofs MeteorVenture in his Nightmare Moon Mech!
9also I have a PO Box in Miami since a few weeks ago...estimated delivery date is 30th of September. Then I got to wait for it to be shipped to Panama from Miami (which is about 2.50 dollars)
/me accuses Natleyn of shenanigans
9 Still I chose Free Shipping from Amazon because the Figuarts is pretty expensive
Nope o_o
Okay, time for me to head to school
9 I mean my Gurren Lagann costed me 10 bucks LOL
Bye Freeze.
9 I was preparing it today for posing together with Shin Ichigo btw
Tschüss Freeze
/me accuses Natleyn of hugging people
Shenanigans!
06,15...wait, that's not a bad thing
RobotPinkie: Damn straight.
/me hugs RobotPinkie
is hugging aganced the rules now?
9>yfw I pull a Vangelous and review it live via Stream
/me hugs Natleyn back
9Well what I'm trying to say is that my most noteworthy toy was 10 bucks, originally 15 but I got it on a clearance sale
If it is, there goes half my activity
9/me wishes he had more money for toys
06,15I'm kind of tempted to kick myself for hugging after you said that, Sumica :P
9 Also here.http://akashingou.wordpress.com/2011/09/13/review-s-h-figuarts-kamen-rider-ichigo-shin-ver/
lol
9And since I'm too poor to afford the Cyclone Bike
/me wants moar money
06,15It's against no rules, and I actively encourage it!
9I still have Kaneda's bike (from Akira), which I bought as a kid back in 2000. Lost the Kaneda figure though...I wonder if No.1 will fit on it well?
9Thing is I'm planning on having him ride Kaneda's Bike
06,15I have Cloud's bike from Advent Children. So sue me. :P
that's a nice bike
9Because the economy is harsh and the Riders were on a tight budget, SO THEY HAD TO BUY AN USED REPLACEMENT WHEN THE CYCLONE EXPLODED.
9hmmm
9you're actually tempting me to check prices for the Cloud Strife Play Arts here in my country
9I've seen it in several places
RobotPinkie: But do you have Cloud's sword from Advent Children?
9The Fenrir is a badass bike, Ichigo would be pretty cool riding that shit
06,15Well, yeah EspyLacopa, the figure also came in the box
06,15Yeah I agree, NewDCD
Oh, I thought you were talking about an actual motorcycle, not a figurine.
/me puts Ichigo on the Fenrir, speeding away, with Cloud in a pose yelling to the skies something along the lines of "RIDER STOLE MY BIKE"
06,15Haha, oh wow, no, I don't have that kind of money :P
06,15I'm poor, feel free to laugh :P
RobotPinkie, piracy!
9If someday I make bigbucks as a doctor
or what are we talking about
9I'll make a full-body THE FIRST cosplay with bike included
06,15I prefer open source, ctrlx, but to each his own.
9and then I'll ride the Cyclone everywhere
Just remember it's never Lupis DCD
9LIKE A RIDER BAWS
06,15That would be amazing, NewDCD
9Bitch, it was Lupus once
RobotPinkie, as long as it's free and not apple, i'm cool with whatever
9Season 3, Episode 9
06,15Pretty much same as me then, ctrlx, lawl
06,15I do pay for my games though, hehe.
i pay for about half my games
9I wish Tamashii stands weren't so expensive
06,15Well, I guess that's not entirely true, I play a lot of free games...
RobotPinkie, i overall pay for probably 15% of hte software i have. but the most i've spent was in games.
06,15and I download roms, like most people :P
and probably half of the games i have are old
roms are piracy as well though
06,15I love old games, it's too bad so many aren't available anymore
they're there. if you know where to look
06,15lol yeah, I guess I'm a pirate like that :P
i spent like $250 at quakecon on games
:x
9 Oh wow wait
06,15Well, I can find most of them easily online, obviously. I mean in stores.
but it was a super good deal
9 It's 15 bucks for THREE stands, and they don't sell them separately
9 Just as well. That's MUCH more reasonable.
06,15What's a Tamashii stand?
http://www.shewsbury.com/2009/11/tamashii-stage-act-3-action-support.html
oh japanese names
http://akashingou.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/1120150.jpg
you so silly
"You say Tomtato, I say Pimp."
9Translator's Note: Tamashii means Soul
06,15Ahhh, that's what they are
Gelgoog is best pony
06,15and yeah, I know what it means :P
9Acguy would like to disagree
i have some gundam figures. my dog chewed on one
2,14 LEVERAGE
NewDCD, i have no idea
06,15speaking of souls, Gintama is pretty awesome... not just because the name kind of sounds like "testicles," either
What?
Natleyn, help me!

06,15HERP ME!

9Sumica: not watching, just in the IRC, working in LesMis project
ah oh well Guess you miss it then
Natleyn, i'm gonna get some cornbread, want some?
06,15I used to follow a couple of Japanese figure blogs... not sure why I don't anymore...
9Gonna take a peek
ctrlx: I'd love some! :3
Cornbread is awesome.
06,15ARRR, I need some Kamen Rider figures
9Also USA is getting an exclusive line of DBZ SH Figuarts
9which outside of US will be Tamashii Web Exclusives
9Read:The Japanese can only buy them online
06,15if I found a KR Faiz figure, my head would probably explode with joy
9I think we should call them Tamashii and Amazon Web Exclusives, eh?
9Pinkie
9c'est un segunde
Speaking in tongues indeed.
/me tosses Natleyn some cornbread with butter already spread
http://www.bigbadtoystore.com/bbts/product.aspx?product=BAN12771&mode=retail
/me catches it in his mouth, nommin' already.

Awwwww yeah, cornbread! <3
impressive
Thanks ctrlx :3

Hiya LordCelestia
/me explodes thrice
9 There's also the Riotroopers

Someone help
06,15You seriously just made my day, NewDCD
9Anyways RobotPinkie
9If you give me a few minutes
2,14 so since this is OG, is there ONLY the custom made ones, or are there other series as well?
2,14 also, did I see Calvina?
9I can find the Faiz SH at the best price I can
LordCelestia: You have to add your own server :l
9No Val, you saw Lamia
Oh
OG is just the banpreso mechs
2,14 ah
06,15:O

9 Toy Arena is selling it for 30 bucks
Huh. SRW Anime?
yes
9There are several
Which series are in this?
06,15Toy Arena?
it's just the Customs
9Divine Wars covers OG1, and SUCKS due to CG mechs
9OG: The Inspectors is MUCH better though
indeed DCD
06,15omfg, so much happy
9also Robot Pinkie: check all of the purchase options
9 also, for you: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_ap6UrDxkY
06,15on Amazon?
9in case you're actually thinking of purchasing it, look at a review first
06,15Thanks so much, NewDCD, seriously <3
ugh
9 if you like Kaix
9Kaixa
9I'd recommend you getting him first though
finally working
9Kaixa was released this month
9Faiz about a year and a half ago
9so Kaixa's architecture is much more advanced
06,15Oh I LOVE his look
9also KUSAKA RAPES MARI IN THE NOVEL
hey
06,15I might get Kaixa first, then
hg
^whoops
9 let me send you a review someone posted on /toy/ for Kaixa first, then
9or be a hero and get Faiz along with it
9and then send me Agito as a gift : 3
9JK JK
06,15Haha, is there an expensive Agito?
they have no chance
ouch
dude bloody
2,14 THOSE BASTARDS! THEY BLEW UP SYDNEY
D:
How do I change my name to LordCelestia
06,15What are the SIC Kiwami Tamashii figures?
\nick isnt working
with /nick
not \nick
9http://myfigurecollection.net/blog/1273 Kaixa Reviews
obviously
you were using \nick?...
/me sighs
no, i used /nick
Hey guys, I'm back from the party.
9 Pinks: S.I.C. stands for Super Imaginative Chogokin, and they redesign characters to more organic/frightening designs
the command isnt doing anything at all
just /nick LordCelestia
how was it LunaTheForgotten ?
That should work.
9Think of them as Ver.Ka. for Toku characters
oh but it works for THAT?
>_>
DashWithRainbows. Very nice.
ugh
9 Kiwami Tamashiis are basically S.I.C.s, but smaller
works for me
06,15Ver.Ka.? Not sure what that is
now to change back
06,15Ahhh okay
9Same design, but about half the size
06,15Gotcha, then
9Version Katoki
i dont see the problem...
Hrm.
brb
there needs to be an MLP episode where they find the ruins of the statue of liberty
random thought
beam coto
or rather it can just be in the background
9For example, this is the Ver.Ka.for Gurren-Lagann http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YF1tNfQVN8w/TFGUL6e9ImI/AAAAAAABIt8/QTbZT5AWYK8/s1600/1.jpg
Beama coato~
Damn it.
GIGA DRILL BREAKAH!
Now I want one.
9(I hear that Gurren Lagann figure is REALLY TERRIBAD though so don't go looking for it. It looks pretty, that is.)
2,14 looks like they pissed off Big Mac
9However, notice the aesthetic differences
9You still recognize it's Gurren-Lagann, but redesigned
Gainaxing is in full motion
06,15Yeah I'm probably just going to get the Faiz and Kaixa figures, NewDCD
06,15The SH ones
9SIC Rider 1 http://i2.squidoocdn.com/resize/squidoo_images/-1/lens18113603_13097143846943_SIC-S-I-C-Vol-14-Kam
9Pinks: did you see the review I sent you?
9 also Kamen Rider Toy General http://boards.4chan.org/toy/res/2547940#2551543
everytime i try to change to LordCelestia it says the name is "in use" but I disconnected from LordCelestia
06,15Yeah, still watching it though, NewDCD
wait a bit then try again
06,15It's looking really good so far
Screw it, I can't figure out mIRC
LordCelestia, xchat2
is xchat free?
9 Also the Figuarts I want the most are Shin Ichigo (duh), Kuuga, Agito, Faiz, and Decade Violent Emotion (because the head sculpt in the original DCD is said to be not so good, and they fixed that by adding a regular-DCD head with better sculpt in the Violent Emotion release)
xchat 2 is
9Oh Pinks
What about that add-on for firefox calle dChatzilla
9 I meant the Kaixa review
9 here http://myfigurecollection.net/blog/1273
chatzilla is free
06,15I wish I were richer, then I'd get you the Agito one
but you need to be running firefox so it's up to you
9 lololol don't worry about it
ill download firefox
9 also Pinkie: Tamashii web exclusives are expensive as fuck overseas
06,15I'm so happy about this, haha
omg steam is pissing me off
9Also man Kaixa is looking GOOD
9holy fuck those are a lot of accessories
06,15Still looking at the Kaixa one, but it looks amazing
OWNED
06,15Love how the feet can move, wow
I gotta go, I was just wondering what you guys were streaming. I'll see y'all next week. Bye
9they're called FiguARTS for a reason
Bye LTF
soleh
06,15Haha, yeah.
death yoyo?
9 Also getting a DCD Figuarts and a GokaiRed Figuarts would be so delightfully meta for me.
06,15Looking at the Blaster Form Faiz, too
How do they just float there?
06,15These are so damn cool.
oh, i see
http://images.4chan.org/toy/src/1316987056282.jpg OH LAWL
9Pinkie: What other Riders do you like?
06,15Kabuto, Kiva, Agito.... not sure what else, it's been a while since I watched any others
Whaaaaat.
9Kabuto and Agito got reviews by Angelus
06,15Kuuga is really good so far
9and Kiva, IDK
9Agito has few accessories...
9here
06,15Kiva isn't exactly my favorite, but at least it's not Den-O :P
9 This review is CLASSIC http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juFOIRDJs1s
06,15Haha, oh lawd
Aww yeah, rainbow dash cursor time.
9Vangelus' on the SH Figuarts: Hide your wallets! Hide them! JUST TRUST ME!!
TIME TO GO SYNC 20 COLORS
:3 i have just over 2400 hours logged in xfire games
Damn. o_o;
06,15It's quite a money sink, I take it :P
9 also http://images.4chan.org/toy/src/1316987056282.jpg
Yay!

06,15HAHA
06,15Great image :P

Wait, someone still uses xfire?
You'd be suprised how well doen the pony version of this was
EspyLacopa, all the time
Which network is bronystate on?
Veewave, the irc is ponychan
06,15Holy crap, that Agito figure looks great

So much death
9Oh. OH SHOUICHI ;___;
NewDCD: About that pic with the pony toys: That hat is AWESOME!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ7Ww3rd06c
It doesn't seem to be working.
EspyLacopa: whut
9Pinkie: AGITO PROMOTIONS FORM
06,15Goddammit, my wallet is going to be hurting soon :(
Oh, you aren't familiar with Adventure Time Natleyn?
I am, that one just... /looks/ weird
That's the original short.

06,15Damn you, Figuarts!
current uptime: 7 days 3 hours 32 mins and 20 sec

Awww. Okay.
this cold is kicking my arse
06,15Thanks, watching it now, yay!
06,15I'm hoping his horn folds...
I remember seeing the movie with japanese original dub
06,15Ah, darn
Hence I have hard time watching the english dubs :P
06,15just when I've hit enter, he says it doesn't :P
9http://blog.livedoor.jp/hacchaka/archives/51731566.html Faiz Blaster images, very sexy
06,15Oh wow, you're not kidding... Now I want to watch some Faiz
Bag of grenades.
Nice.
06,15You're the one streaming, now?
"Let me reach for my... _banana bag_"
So... you're an mmmmmmbeyetch who likes mmmmmmmmmmgrenades
/me steals the banana bag. . .
9also Faiz Axel is a tamashii web exclusive
9And I can't stream right now
RAIN. <3
one of the better songs
06,15Ah alright. So where do I get Tamashii web exclusives?
Love the OST for this. Not all of the songs are as awesome, but there are a bunch of good ones imo
9Supposedly Japan-only
06,15Damn....
9because you can only buy it on the Tamashii site
9but you can buy them in other stores
06,15Man, I love this guy's reviews
9as in, for example, BigBadToyStore has Axel Form in stock....
9...for 75 bucks
06,15Ouch, crap
9that's the problem with web exclusives. Expensive as FUCK.
9Just the NON-TRANSFORMING Ride Vendor of OOOs is 40 bucks because it's a Tamashii Web Exclusive
06,15I kinda want to try to get as many Faiz figures as I can, hehe
anyone else having an issue with steam?
Imagine a to scale Unicron toy.
9and the bikes are very expensive because of this as well. Only Hardboiler and Cyclone ver. THE FIRST are nonen-exclusives
9Get a Riotrooper. DO IT FILLY.
9also, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZqDw4tmVLw&feature=relmfu COOLGUY
http://www.bigbadtoystore.com/bbts/product.aspx?product=BAN13866&mode=retail

*9Axel
Face grab!
06,15Goddammit, Axel looks so damn nice, too, NewDCD
Green Bird, I think.
yeah
ponychat doesn't show up in the network list.
06,15lol "Bandai China tramp stamp"
06,15Guess we know what Kuuga's cutie mark is, now :P
9WELL PLAYED PINKS
Veewave: What are you using?
xchat 2
Huh.
or mirc
/me takes off his clothes slowly.
I got 'em both
MrChang: What.
/me shoots MrChang
Thanks, Veewave
*bang bang
06,15Man, all those Figuarts figures look so damn good
9 also if you're going to get several Figuarts, Pinks, you might as well get these http://www.shewsbury.com/2009/11/tamashii-stage-act-3-action-support.html
9I KNOW. CRACK IS CHEAPER.
9 and there are DBZ and One Piece Figuarts, too...
9......Oh, Japan ;___;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bETCusT5kNM <-- The Cat Came Back
06,15I think I might take up a crack habit instead, yeah :P
06,15Nah, KR figures are much cooler than crack
9That is the only thing
9 Pinks where do you live again?
Sorry for cutting it short tonight but I need to rest up for work and what not.
06,15Sweden
Bit like playing warhammer: a crack habit might be cheaper but warhammer is less deadly
06,15So imports... might be a bit expensive
Thanks for streaming Sumica! :3
/me hugs Sumica
2,14 thanks sumica!
9but Sumica, you're closer to Japan than US is
9 Shipping from Hobbylink Japan might be cheaper
06,15lol not Sumica
Danke Sumica
will pop in time to time throughout the week but probably wont stream again till the saterday pony eps
Ohai everypony!
It's not just shipping, it's the insane customs that cranks it up :P
9DERP I MEAN PINKS
9i HERPED SO MUCH I DERPED http://www.hlj.com/
06,15Thanks for streaming though Sumica, I enjoyed the first episodes <3
ctrlx: xD
I don't know why that made me laugh, but it did.
06,15Hmmmm, maybe it could work, NewDCD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2-cTx2kfTk&feature=related
oh right I should reset my router, should have my better interwebs now. Back in a second.
Trixie
http://www.hlj.com/product/BAN963202
9Regular Faiz is getting restocked though.
/me sings "I don't want anypony else,..."
lol i live in rural illinois :(
brb
06,15That's a lot on shipping, though.... hmm, I wonder how much it is from the US
steam why do you do this to me
/me has been playing more and more Rusty Hearts via steam
i saw that game. looked meh for me.
9Pinkie: BigBadToyStore is US-Based and it can give you a shipping estimate with the different services, so add an item to your cart and check it then.
but steam is just being super gay for me
It plays like those old sidescrolling beat-em-up arcade games, like Double Dragon.
9Oh wow
9 >Sweden, USPS Air Mail, 20 bucks
9Yeaaaaaaaaah you should probably see if there's some PO Box system you can use, like me
It's pretty good, yeah. Though the first boss to really annoy me was Gloves. "Didn't block my punch? Have 120 damage and go flying. Problem with that?"
Heh.
I play the mage, so I just hit my handy dandy heal button.
NewDCD, 20 bucks isn't much
06,15Yeah, I just checked, NewDCD
And hit him from the back repeatedly.
get a flat rate box
9alsoPinkie, as an alternative
Yeah, I tried to beat him with block, then I realized that the timing has to be just-so or it won't let you. So then I resorted to running away and spamming mage spells.
9Korea has their own runs of Figuarts...they're currently airing Decade there, so maybe you could buy an SH from Korea?
I'm thinking of going back in there and just practicing the whole blocking trick until I've got it down properly.
My Little Q, Part 2: Nice.
Seems I need to go yell at my isp again.
The timing's pretty tough, yeah. I may run it multiple times just to get the hang of it.
Sumica, you're not the only one
I should DC in 30 mins
Running away is for pansies. I just run around to his back and start wailing on him with my magic sword and spells.
Dunno why but it happens almost always at 2:36AM
06,15Oh wow, my girlfriend is just in SK, NewDCD
Well mine was supposed to upgrade my speed last wendsday, and they failed me so they reset it for today.
I have no problem whatsoever with playing like a pansy. :D
Still failed.
Especially if it works.
06,15...I might have to convince her to look around for me
i see no problem with it
Yea, but that's not how you get the higher rankings ^_^
consider it sniping vs knife fighting
Well, depends.
If you spam him and throw him off, you can slam him with a few hits to keep your ranking up.
I went in charging melee and get triple S rank.
OMG FLARIA HI
9 Pinks: HOLD ON TO THE PHONE. Gonna ask in the Rider General how to get them toys from Korea
Can't wait for level 10 to start using a scythe.
I managed a B or so while spamming the whole way, which is "good enough" in my book. If it's above a B it fulfills the rank reqs.
LONG TIME NO SEE
Same
HIYA CTRLX
/me shoots cornbread out of a cannon at Flaria
Hey guys
I hope there's more "My Little Q"
06,15Alright, NewDCD, not ordering anything today either way, have to make really sure I can afford it first :P
I'm using ChatZilla, I got it working :D
/me launches herself into the air via flames, catching the cornbread in her mouth midair
/me lands gracefully
/me claps
I'm wondering when the fourth character in that game will be available to play.
steam better get to working so i can play more oblivion
game's a classic
/me bows to the audience (err, just LordCelestia then)
/me tosses Flaria roses and cheers
Dunno.
But I'm liking the mage so far at least.
Will have to try the others at some point.
I haven't even tried out the other two playable characters.
lol @ ctrlx
/me picks up a rose and puts it in her hair
I'm enjoying the whole magic spam too much.
Yeah. I usually prefer distance combat. Which is why I regret having to use my sword so much, haha.
And Frantz seems like too much of a whiner.
/me glomps Flaria
Hi me!
I get the sense he's been listening to too much Linkin Park
Hi me!
Oblivion Players: "By the Nine Divines!"
/me is glomped
/me looks around then carries Flaria offstage out the back of the theatre
STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM!
Where are you taking me? o.o;
/me has no idea what LordCelestia is up to...
/me is taking Flaria back to his castle
muahaha
/me suggest we form a mob
LordCelestia, pff
/me jump hides in Flaria's pocket
Thats not how you spell IceKing
/me is still on the moon and can somehow contact you guys...
I would not bring any tpye of Ice King back to my castle
magic? or super leet hax?
also
9Riobot Gurren-Lagann looks pretty sweet.

/me wriggles out of LordCelestia's grasp and vanishes in a torrent of raging flames
I have returned!
Welcome back, Pegacorn
/me still hiding in Flaria's pocket
/me frowns. "I just wanted to show her my theatre. I was gonna offer her a royal job opportunity but I guess it's her loss."
LordCelestia,why are you frowning?
/me mounts Pegacorn
okay
Oh well.
I was going to show Flaria my royal studio but she vanished when I was carrying her back against hyer will.
:)
:p
GET OFF OF ME VEEWAVE!
PIG PILE
signing off now guys cya!
06,15That's a hong kong site, I guess
/me jumps on top of Pegacorn too
/me rides Pegacorn like a bull this time
Hmph.
06,15Are they the same models, NewDCD?
/me has hired Nick to get rid of anypony who DARES try to ride me.
Good thing im the most powerful pony in equestria
/me pig piles ontop of Pegacorn
:D
.....I forgot that Nick is on a vacation right now.
/me does not care because riding Pegacorn is the only fun thing in life
9what do you mean models?
/me crawls away
06,15I mean the Figuarts from SK and Japan, are there differences?
/me smiles (Winning!)
9 No no
9Bandai Japan just sells those in South Korea
9because they export Kamen Rider shows there
06,15Cool, that's very good to know
9same with the Phillipines, who get english dubs of KR
9They're like three shows behind though
06,15Well that's okay, I'm mostly interested in Faiz and Kabuto figures
/me falls unconsious
/me is watching Priest "This is some weird stuff!"

/me takes all of Pegacorn's popcorn while said pony is unconscious
/me shares popcorn with Veewave
/me kicks back in chair made up of unconscious ponies
*pony
/me is holding a newspaper that says "In other news PEGACORN HAS WORST DAY OF FRIGGIN' LIFE"
Any ideas?
06,15Thanks, NewDCD, I will
Make like a graduation picture for the fillies.
/me regains consiousness
I mean the young ponies in the school
06,15Man, I haven't been to 4chan in so long
Make a picture with one color and shade. :p
Oh, hi herospirit

9 Pinks: I ussually arrange it so things can pile up at friends places around the world (like have my shf sit with a friend in japan for a few months), sortof like BBTS pile of loot and then have a shitton of stuff shipped to you once every few months. ultimatly i save quite a bit on that. But if you cant arrange that, shipping for a single shf via sal from lets sey HLJ is like 580 yen to
9friends. OR just bite the bullet, we all do that from time to time
finding stuff in Korea tho? no idea
/me jumps on Pegacorn and holds on tight
/me turns to LordCelestia

/me falls asleep
It's my way of asserting myself

Second Comic <3
Poor Cereal.
/me d'awws.
according to wikipedia, FIM first aired on October 10 last year...
so that means Dash's REAL birthday is in 15 days!!!
>implying pilot episode= Dash's birthday
/me only has a dA account for trollan
Thats nice. >.>
Some of those people need to be woken up. I'm performing a service.
I hated DA with a passion
Actuall, I still do
But I made one in order to get a bit more exposure, maybe be part of a few groups, get out there
You guys should see the amount of Portal/MLP crossover art on DA
Huh.
the two best series ever.
/me hates dA with the force of a thousand suns, but likes a small percentage of the artists there.
I have a friend with a birthday on October 10th.
I think I get the same amount of views from posting in an underground forum thread at the end of the internets
2,14 lol, I'm loving the new Spike is RD meme
Milliways?
It's funny because it's A CANON MEME
Silly AllisZero, the internets have no end!
2,14 yeah, when that happened in the ep I was like "Oh, that's SO going to be a meme"
...unless you count milliways, of course.
Spike as Rainbow Dash reminds me of that pokemon, Totodile.
>implying the internet doesn't have edges
Brb, gonna go shower before going to bed.
Someday, the internet will become sentient and be the greatest and most powerful troll ever.
The trolling version of Skynet?
Introducing, the Great and Powerful INTERNET!
I for one, welcome our future troll overlord.
Wait. What if this was Skynet's plan all along?
*I,
XD Trollestia, you are now awesome.

Hmm.. stuff.
2,14 SHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Whoever is righteous, let him kill his father. Let him call his father names.

Huh, didn't realize Jeff Dunham had a new special on tonight. O.o
Yet another reason that ponies are better than drugs
30 seconds: wut
40 seconds: i'mokaywiththis
2,14 you kidding? ponies ARE drugs
Val, this is true.
pony=antidepressant
^
^^
Ponies are my drug and my anti-drug.
Forget LSD. Try this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntIFhbtmwCc&feature=related
Not like I needed an anti-drug, but it fit.
It gets trippier towards the end
FOR SCIENCE!

Lil' Jacob is pure win.

playing pools with the guy is always fun.
I'm not too big on GTA4.. it's alright.
And killing people with him.
if I had a penny for every pixle in this video......I would have a penny
inb4 Youtube comments?
The quality's not that bad.
Also, Badman
Badman is also awesome.
if I had a penny for every pixle in this video.......I would have a penny

OH, this misshun
if I had a penny for every pixle in this video...I would have one pixle

I hate those stupid quality comments anyways.. gets so annoying.

Headshots, man. Headshots.
the guy isn't down yet
yeah not used to 8by6
Dat steam
interface*
normaly play fullscreen
I probably wouldn't be so great in that game with a mouse.
Trollestia, you gotta watch this
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDUzTnv7SM&feature=related
It's something you would probably do
:D
Oh god I hated that sun so much.
I've seen it, and yes. Yes I would.
Another sweet video
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu3j3Qh7sTE&feature=related
>mfw I understand it isn't listening to the rock city radio
Radio Vladivostok <3
:(
yaaaaay
I heard "Little Pony" on the radio...
rawr
<3 that station. And I think I did to- also Trollestia
/me likes Vladivostok, Broker, and the one with the reggae.
I was going to go sleeping... then I thought I'll read one fic a chapter... now 4 chapters later...
GJ
I was always listening to LRR.
always.
LRR's pretty good as well.
lawl ye can hear it in the background even then
Another EPIC video (kinda) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yFB67WmuIc&feature=related
Wait, no. Watch this one
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQM-CRhvLnY&feature=watch_response
anyhoof, I'll bugger off now, need to get some sleep in
/me hugs Diftraku
Sleep well. (again)
Bye Diftraku
/me would have to be a summon or something.
so how bad is the video any ways?
Sumica: it is alright
/me looks up the price of the game on Steam, since my PS3 copy's broken.
It's surprisingly good.
^Sumica
playing at 800by600 so I can still see chat and such
I miss this game.
but should be able to run it ok will up the quality when they get around to the speed update
Anyone know some good games on Steam available for Mac?
TF2
^
I might get Alpha Protocol though I know the reviews aren't great for it and I may never touch it.
the half-life series
I WOULD already have both of those...
headshot!
Nittany, it has enough good points that for $2 I would definitely recommend it.
K
but I don't play FPS games much
Headshots are the only way to fight in this game.
Nittany, just remember to go pistols/stealth
Wow, $2 for Alpha Protocol.. that's pretty sweet.
The only time I get major games on Steam is if they are either really cheap or if someone's going to let me in on a 4-pack.
I got Civ 5 when it was 75% off, so that made me happy
Civ 5 is a great game to spend an entire weekend on.
And of course I pre-ordered Portal 2 long before the release
08,1hehehehehe >>
I don't have much time for gaming and nearly no patience for MP gaming anymore.
FlutterBOOM: Wat
/me greatly prefers MP.
Trollestia: everytime I tried MP, cheats were rampant.
In what game?
Portal 2 was released at 1:10 AM on a tuesday, for me.
I can't stand MP. I'm terrible at games like BC2 and MW2.
FlutterBoom
I did the entire SP campaign on thursday
I explode twice as much as you do
:P
and the entire Co-Op on friday.
/me explodes.
Sumica, the cars with that paintjob are affiliated with Lil' Jacob's gang
just letting that out there
coo I guess
/me explodes violently.
aww yeah that radio station
/me loves this commercial.
yeah
I know where you guys won't be able to explode...
I'm listening to a stream of my local rock radio station.
/me explodes
because there's no oxygen...
/me also likes the irish mob on top of the Jamaicans.
OOON THE MOOOOOOON BEEEEE-YIIIIIIIITCCCHES
/me rigs the moon with explosives.
I don't require oxygen to explode.
The Irish guys are awesome, but I prefer Jacob.
yeah. Patrick and Jacob are my two favourite characters.
well, I gotta go
Bye.
cya DOC
/me hugs DashOrCrash goodnight
Sleep well :3
later, bronies
wrong button >_<
LOL
/me waves her branches

YES.

/me can relate with Niko.
s/with/to
Trollestia, what did you think of the bank mission?
Poor Irish guys.
yeah, but the mission in general was pretty darn awesome.
It was, I'll admit.
Remember the advert for the magical girl/mecha animu on the radio?
YES
and I rofled at it each time.
9 hey is robotpinkie still around?
NewDCD!!!

Younger, as well.
Oh No!

2,14 you know those moments when people are over and you just want them to leave, but they wont?

/me always took the red vehicles, since RED GOES FASTAH
Trollestia, can you tunr her back to normal? Or somehing?
/me replants the filly.
Your going to get Trollestia to help her..
Sumica: be careful shooting the backtires, you can set fire to the gastank
True
/me walks away, realizing I wont want to be here to see the end result
holdon
/me squirms as she's put into the dirt, crying
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TROLLESTIA

Noooo! Get Twilight Sparkle..
"I shouldntve asked him for herlp with all his shenannigans"
>.<
Funny thing is, just YOU try running away that fast with your tires blown
08,1Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep!
Meh. I tried.
indeed, Allis
I think that crash was caused by falling out of the world for a second
Likely
Not sure what the hell that was but was a nice save =p
/me hides in a bush, making sure trollestia wasn't following
Sumica: what crash?
I miss GTA. Maybe I should pick SA or GTA 4 back up.
Or hills.
Trollestia: indeed, twas fun.
Or anything to look at past the parking lot.
oh hey the swingset
THE SWINGSET
I bought GTA 4 + DLC on PC super-cheap, but I heard stories of it's poor optimization and triple DRM.
Aaaanyway, I'm gonna head to bed everypony
DO IT FILLY
Yeah the DRM on GTA 4 is ridiculous
Wait, what the hell am I thinking?
Sumica: you need to back into it

[22:21:29]	<Trollestia>	You press up on the Dpad twice on PS3, dunno about PC.
ffs
trollestia, he's trolling you
/me is mildly annoyed, hardly mad.
I know what you said Trollestia.
"Holy shit, it's a GUN"
XD
daw the song just ended
lawl "The question isn't why? But why not?"
Metallica live on YT. Kick ass.
no way nittany
yahweh
it's Rock in RiO!
seems I lost my gun in that wwreck
Though Slipknot is on right now.
Eh.. Slipknot's.. okay.
oh hai NYC
I mean Liberty City
But I can't watch right now :(
DAY9 IS NOW LIVE
IT'S A PARADE
Why not Flutterguy? Copyright BS?
Sumica, drop some molotovs when in those situations
also, the truck at that street corner respawns. Very useful to ram through anything.
OSHIT
Sumica's fighting the law
Nittany, on mobile right now and my phone's YT isn't working :/
Calmly talking to himself while flying through the air LIKE A BAWS
and the law's...losing?
Oh.
ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH
I can't watch YT or be online for long on my phone or my battery dies within 4 - 5 hours.
Same here
Worse off, 3G reception at my office desk sucks.
exactly Dermathil
So I sometimes can't listen to anything at all or stream radio.
I'm actually on wireless atm.
Know the feeling of 3G at work
I could possibly go on wireless at the office, but the signal is protected.
Sumica: Black SWAT trucks are bulletproof
And it's not WEP/WPA protected.
Yourworkplace's wireless signal?
Yeah.
That sounds a bit stupid to be hobest, J mean the no protection.
I can only access it via VPN (which can be unstable) or using SecureW2 (better).
It is protected.
Just not with a standard method.
Damnit, thid is why I hate IRC on my phonr, my keyboard.
dat nickspam
aww
damn blindsided spaun cop
More nickspam?
<3
What the hell?
inb4 mods
they love to spwn cops on top of you
/me hugs TrollightSparkle
No, just had to register them all
back to normal game play I guess
Well thak yiu
<)<
Thank you*
dat idiot
>running in fire like a bawss
Confound thesss sandboxes
Apparently, everything Nico doed is boss.
does* damnit
they drive me to killing sprees
indeed
thees cars suck
Sumica: the cars later are better)
/me drops people at random in RDR and noone seems to care.
Lucky Trollestia.
/me thought that was the average RDR experience.
Sumica, tailgate hi
For me, it was like "Knife someone in town out of view of others, suddenly wanted".
That too. It's a mixed bag.
I must've gotten the short end
I wasn't up to bears yet :l
o.o Flaria
/me spends lots of time on challenges.'
OH SHIIIIIIIIT
COUSIN
COUSIN
COME HANG OUT COUSIN
THAT'S A MIGHTY FINE HORSE YOU HAVE THERE MR. MARSTON
NewDCD, please kick Shadowmane for me, if you would.
Ii didn't get too far into RDR, I sold it after about a week.
*RING RING RING*
COUSIN, LET US GO BOWLING
that's fine, thanks ValtheJean
The story isn't one to be missed, Flutterguy.
*RING RING RING*
COUSIN!
LET US GO TO BAR!
It wasn't really the story Trollestia, iit was just.. so slow.
/me likes the slowness.
I'm hit and miss with pace.
I can like or dislike fast and slow paced games.
I'm not picky about pace. Just so long as it isn't too far to either extreme.
Right now though, I'm obsessed with Uncharted 2, TF2, and Terraria.
All very great.
I usually don't care for the pace. So long as I get my share of adrenalin, I'm happy.
Yay Terraria!
I've been playing lots of TF2 while waiting for a PS3 part.
/me brohoofs Flaria, yes!
I've been 100%-ing it since 1.0.3 -___-
/me brohoofs Flutterguy
I just got into it actually.
I'm being lazy right now, though.
I don't feel like trying to get the
The uhh.
The new Jungle Rose.
My friend was like "Here try this", 3 minutes later, I'm reaching for my wallet to buy it.
Jungle rose ain't new
I'm a noob ._
Only have Silver and Iron armor atm lol.(
But a couple of Gold tools
Dermathil: Old jungle rose was turned into Jungle Spores
yes
New jungle rose has a shit drop rate
>yfw I think I still got one
Don't feel like getting it right now.
Jungle rose?
yes
I think I got a new one
2,14 jesus, I don't think this game can get more political
What's jungls rpse?
rrose*
Global warming's a hoax, just like World War 2!
ROSE* OHMYGOD
Valthejean, that's just parodies.
It's a head slot vanity item
indeed
LIBERTY ROCK RADIO
2,14 parody my ass
IT DOESN'T STOP YOU FROM ROCKING
It's too bad I don't feel like memorizing the potion recipes.
Valthejean, they're just joking about Fox News with Weasel News.
Faux News <3
2,14 yeah, and?
I see what you did there Trollestia.
They aren't to be taken seriously
Also, some of their clips of liberals talking about guns sound frighteningly real.
Because if you do, what's down the road is the same train of thoughts that bring people to say that games like GTA are the cause for a spike in violent crimes (when they really are just becoming rarer)
"Damn rednecks get your semiautomatic death machines out mah city" and whatnot
2,14 sigh...you're missing the point...but it isn't worth getting into ANOTHER one of these debates
indeed
Dermathil Funny story about that.. I had that mindset for a while then I realized, it's a game.(
Flutterguy: eh.
It's a very political game, but I love it for that.
I dunno, I was thinking of getting GTA4
There are really people who think that violent crimes are becoming more common due to games like GTA.
/me shrugs
That's depressing.
There are people who think video games in general are worse than "music" of today.((
Drawfaggery, I go.
Which pisses me off ever so much.
Trollestia, the stats actually demonstrate that violent crimes are becoming less common, since most people who think about commiting those crimes actually vent their frustrations on their videogames instead of people now
I believe that.
Seems likely.
/me hugs Flutterguy
Welcome back~
ohai
Was switching from phone back to my computer.
Sumica, make your choice. You gonna kill him? Or you gonna let him go?
/me almost always lets him go.
Dem mad parhour skills

eh, I think if he survives you meet him again
/me likes how pentacles are associated with magic instead of satanism nowadays.
Trollestia, they are only associated with satanism when upside down.
FFFFFFFFFFF
LOL
HAHAHAHAHAHHAAH
:3
I know that, but I've met some people who stubbornly swear otherwise.
Also, accept then call again and call it off for no relationship loss.
Oh gosh. I hate the cabaret club.
the shows at the comedy club are just so much better and genuinely funny.
it not unlocked yet
Bedtime. Bye everpony
I know, and that's a shame, sumica.
G'night.
Sleep well Rainbow-Dash!
/me hugs Rainbow-Dash
>CABLES
He stopped focusing and she fell. FUCKING MAGIC
indeed.
next time I go drinking >_<
We are all that little girl sometimes. But we don't fall off.
We FLY
She's prolly the best of the entire show
oh, this mission.
/me plays "Room on Fire" or whatever the name is
oh you...
Mmm, potatoes.
Vodka <3
Nice shooting.
ffff
thanks
DISREGARD EXECUTION
ACQUIRE HEADSHOT
you didn't even do the execution
got the job done did't it?
yeah but he didn't get shot in the eye
looked that way to me =p
What's on the stream?
nah I think you put the gun in the eye and pull the trigger, looks more awesome.
GTA 4
I'm not on the website it's on, so. :P
/me only ever got to the missions with the 1st of the 2 remaining living guys
will keep that in mind
Like how the police don't care about driving :P
would be too hard to code I think
Yeah.
oh ffff rain
... I sure have a lot of favourite people here.
Oh really?
Oh snap.
Ow.
cupcakes any one?
o.o
lawl
Why *do* they call it a hacksaw?
Trollight, EspyLacopa, ctrlx, Fluttershy`, Whatpayne, Xerion, Diftraku, RobotPinkie as a friends...
Hacking is what I do with the knife?
:3
Oh nooooo
/me flys away.
NewDCD and Sumica for Mecha <3
And that was the move that made me temporarily like that guy.
Ohai PinKAMINA
what
Pinkamina, why so highlight?
Pinkamina, it's someone else's name :P
Why am I laughing at this?
LIKE A BAWS
Lols.
Pinkamina and Pinkamena.
What just
/me brohoofs Trollestia
i need to get _laptop reg'd under ctrlx
I don't even
sorry was grabbing dinner
herospirit, You got me.
What just happened.
/me brohoofs Flaria.
/me resumes hiding in Flaria's pocket
Too many favourite people x.x
ctrlx why u in there
._. how is it possible?
you, even.
WHAT 9000
THERE'S NO WAY THAT CAN BE RIGHT.
Flaria, because it's warm and snuggly
'cause I'm a fire mage :3
Everyone active in chat now is one of my favourite people here >.>
even me? =p
Trololo
need to remap that
Sumica I love you and DCD for Mecha :3
fail
Flaria, what should i eat for dinner?
>mfw I be one of Flaria's favs
Agh
Aghughugh
Stomach.
Dermathil is... well, Dermathil.
/me hugs Dermathil
MFW
heheheh
ctrlx: What do you have? o.o
Nnnngannnnnng stomach. GODDAMMIT STOMACH
(mfw "Goddammit" recognized by spell check)
Flaria, i have no idea. bagels, ramen, left over tacos, um.... cereal...
herospirit's stomach: Behave you :l
Oof, you too?
I swear, if an alien pops outta my stomach, I'm not gonna be surprised. :|
I already puked my guts up two nights ago, stomach
What more do you want!?
herospirit It hungers.. for more.
ctrlx: I'd have a bagel and some ramen, but that's just me.
mfw I only recently find out how good ramen is when you boil water instead of microwaving it
Good luck with your alien baby stomach, Critic.
D:
Flaria, both? never thought bout that. sounds fine to me :3
it bothers me when people drain the water out of ramen
Same to you and your puke-filled one. :(
Stomachaches suck.
:[
You don't drain it, that's missing the point.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOURE DUMPING OUT ALL HTE FLAVOR
ctrlx: I have a lot of unrelated things that I eat together because one isn't enough.
getting better at those head shots
You drink the broth afterwards :3 or is that just me?
You gotsa drain some of the water BEFORE you add the flavoring!
Flaria, they'll work fine enough
/me trots off to make some din dins
But leave enough for the broth!
Like yesterday I had cheese doodles, twizzlers, ramen, yogurt and orange juice for a snack.
Goddammit now I'm sick AND hungry.
Mm, same.
You drink the broth afterward~
That's right!
YES!
That is, assuming you don't burn your mouth and throat doing it.
:|
But don't have too much water in for the broth, or else the flavoring gets diluded.
NNNG
ohhhhhh
making myself hungry.
I took the burn :D
Guys, I gotta go to bed now
stupid school nights -_-
Night, M'lord.
Bye LordCelestia
And I know that feel.
Good night.
night hero and flutterguy and trollestia
Sumica <3
/me hugs LordCelestia goodnight
Hm, point. It's Sunday innit....I should probably go to bed too. xD
Sleep well!
Man, I dunno if I can make school tomorrow.
dat slo-mo
I'm going to bed in 19.
GUYS before I go, I wanna advertise something
This is an example of a pony profile
I'm going to bed.. eventually :l
I have work tomorrow, but fuck it.
Dunno if I want to. My students disturb me with their distinct lack of pony-recognition. :| Oh well, g'night!
I can make these for anyone who wants them with different text, color, editing, all that stuff
Night Critic
CriticKitten tab fail :/
I made the first four school weeks with only one sick day and thought maybe I could keep under the 10 day limit this semester.
But OF COURSE NOT.
alright buh-bye
CriticKitten: Goodnight?
/me hugs CriticKitten goodnight
Sleep well :3
Night Critic and Celestia!
Naw, have mIRC. So I can leave the chat open and still go to bed. :p
Nnng. Really, the number of my sick days is the least of my worries. I just don't want to be sick anymore.
/me trives by brail
/me thinks back to his days as a small child, filled with tomfoolery and happiness, and not being ill.
So any one here like jeff Dunham?
/me isn't sure if he can actually remember that far back anymore.
/me remembers the times that he almost feigned illness so he wouldn't have to go back to school.
They said I could become anything I wanted
...they lied.
:I
They said I could become anything I wanted..
So I became pony.
:)
Flutterguy, if only.
xD
They said I would never be anything...
So I became a gun nut living off the land.
:D
So you said "Fuck that, I'm going to the moon."
That too.
They said I would never become anything...
guy has anger issues
They told me I'd never be anything. :l
so I became nothing instead.
Then I made stuff.
And parkour.
I'm resident ninja to a few places.
You're a traceur?
/me nods
/me wants to get into parkour but can't.
I thought I was the only one here.
finally
a bagel and ramen
:33
/me could only do parkour long before he knew what parkour was.
The dinner of champions ctrlx!
I haven't been to many sessions, but I've been doing my own stuff since I was like.... 7.
Someone was like "Hey you go climb that" and I did.
And then I just kept climbing stuff.
And getting over other things.
i can jump off stuff
:0
Seriously, I was a fucking ninja as a small child. Then diseases. Now I'm a lazy fuck.
/me hugs herospirit
i got in trouble one day at work for being on the roof
just walking around
/me doesn't do parkour in groups or anything, but I run and take lessons.
I am an expert at self loathing though. The fucking best there is. :0
Also I'm a high level pants wizard.
KoL?
"KoL?"?
/me was wrong.
what does a pants wizard do?
:I
Trollestia: Take lessons?
I cast pants.
Well, not in perosn.
Obviously.
person
What kind of lessons? o_o
SILLY QUESTION, CTRLX.

LOL.
DSNesmith: THAT IS A DAMN GOOD B MOVIE
This is a real masterpiece.
WHAT AM I WATCHING DSN.
House of the Dead
<3
/me still crying uncontrollably due to traumatized state of mind
this movie is so amazing
they CUT IN FOOTAGE FROM THE GAME
U PTSD, bro?
you can't FAKE direction that bad
DSNesmith: It's my vote.
/me can't respond due to ptsd

\:|/
D:

House of the Dead
Eat it anyway!
just remember that
Power through the pain :3
Flaria, ima do half a bagel first
But I'm a fire wizard, so you might not be able to trust me.
Okay guys, watch this vid with me. It's some of the "best" scenes from a horrible movie. My friend told me to watch it, to see how "so bad it's good" this movie is.
I haven't seen it yet, so I can't tell you what to expect
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwSTDzaZ234
i'm a.... o-o i have no idea
Ladies and gentlemen
OH HELL NO
BIRDEMIC
oh god
birdemic.
Birdemic?
make it go away
XD
*swings coat hangers wildly*
DSN
If I get the B Movie....
the editing in Birdemic is downright criminal
guys i feel like i'm back in high school
Hitchcock's The Birds.
You know what to expect.
i haven't been back in high school since i was back in high school
LOL.
birdemic makes me ashamed to watch movies
The exploding bird clipart! The horror!
i don't really care for birds
oh god the bird.gif monsters
chickens are cute though :3
bok bok
exploding... bird... clipart?
D:
the birds
/me walks around like a chicken
when they dive
THE BIIIIRDS
they make stuka bomber noises
bok bok bok
/me pecks at the ground
/me hugs Sumica
Thanks for streaming :3
/me scratches at the dirt
MAKE THE .GIFs LEAVE OUR HEROES ALONE
bok
Not done yet. have somthing a bit specal
Oh? :3
watch as our intrepid heroes bravely defend their car on the abandoned highway
er, the highly populated highway
Sumica: dat Normandy wallpaper
and by defend I mean swing coat hangers ineffectually
Ahaha, oh my god. I am so using this as a B movie suggestion.
birdemic is soul-suckingly bad
the main "actor" deserves a prison sentence
I know. Maybe bad enough to beat bronystate.
don't
please
Don't go there.
Babes in Toyland nearly broke us
We're not trying to compete.
Birdemic would kill us all
I know. And Birdemic...
Stream is off?
WILL DESTROY YOU
the best part about birdemic
is that the director genuinely thinks he made a good movie
James Nguyen
it's a love story
This makes "The Room" look like a fuckking masterpiece
between a young model and a cardboard box
ok back up
Aw damn, Jeff Dunham.
"The Room" is a fucking masterpiece.
and yes normandy wallpaper
herospirit, you absconding to bed with me?
the room is a special movie
....
Not like that :l
Flaria, rephrase that question.
it is to date the only movie that has made me burst out laughing at the FIRST line of dialogue
wut
herospirit, are you going to bed at the same time as I am?
Babes in toy land got the offce space treatment.
ie: now.
About now, yeah
Kay.
/me hugs herospirit
I may cheat and stay up another like eight minutes
Flaria, if you're going to bed i just wanna let you know
that my ramen is cooled down now
RBD... app?
The dialouge in Birdemic is genious
do want
the "dialogue"
/me hugs sumica, Flutterguy, Trollestia, DSNesmith , Dermathil, ctrlx
ftfy
G'night.
/me waves g'night to flaria
oh i see, i'm last D:>
ctrlx: Yay :3
"Hi. The eagles killed our friends. Do you have a phone?"
cya Flaria
/me hugs Flaria good night!
/me hug Flaria
gnite silly filly :33
Night Flaria! May your dreams be filled with Ponies that pony pony!
Sleep well all of you! :3
is that song...
wait till the ending of birdemic
ZZTop?
You too herospirit, my little beta tester <3
they go to the beach
and the movie ends
it's exactly as retarded as it sounds
XD
I've looked up Birdemic.. and I'm already disappoint.
The trailer for the movie is great.
"MEET ROB!" *rob walks in* "HI."
did you see the clapping scene
hey my guilds name
Fun with puppets.
seriously the worst part of birdemic is the editing
"HE'S IN LOVE WITH A YOUNG MODEL DRIVEN BY" *voice drops two octaves* "PASSIOOOON...."
the guy who edited that footage
deserves to have his license revoked
his BREATHING license
Passion. That would be FLuttershy.
VE GO
/me doesn't have a phone, but wants the app.
What the hell. I see the trailer for this and I've gotta say, what the hell.
yeah birdemic is a rare level of bad
No words can describe.
plan 9 level
utter incompetence combined with optimism
it's a beautiful combination
what are you all talking about?
Birdemic
shock and terror
Oh my god, ahaha. I'm DEFINITELY suggesting this if I get a B movie lottery win.
herospirit do it.
I heard a roomer DSN
Are you saying there is a filmm that comapres with PLan 9?
okay, I'm still going with House of the Dead though
A ROOOOOOOMER
When is the lottery for the movie pick btw?
saturday
in 2 weeks
Alright.
I think
I still want labrinth.
:l
so did they confirm my suspicions about next week's movie?
a "bee" movie, if you will
DSNesmith: eeeenope
Is Full Metal Jacket in the running?
oh, lawl, cube
Lol Full Metal Jacket would be awesome.
if one week I am feeling evil
I will suggest Grave of the Fireflies/A Serbian Film for A/B
that would be the worst BMN ever
OMG. That was SILLY beyond BELIEF.
mfw the chat closes to keep my from telling my horrible rumor.
What would be the worst BMN? What was silly beyond belief?
That dummy.
A: Grave of the Fireflies. B: A Serbian Film.
DSN
even ponies couldn't save that
I heard.
The maker of Birdemic.
a roomer
yeah
I'm sitting here. And I'm watching part of birdemic. LOLOL
Is working on a sequel.
Btw Babes in toyland was so bad we have a new rule for moviees that bad.
birdemic II, electric boogaloo
babes in toyland
/me never saw one fucking babe in toyland
/me didn't get to see Babes in Toyland :l
didn't "get"
Sumica: what's the rule?
THe dummy got a haircut.
the "Worst Movies Clause"
Movies deemed that bad will not get a second showing ever.
not even the next day
Welp, I got to go now.
Bye herospirit!
Night everyone
AHHHHH! SCARY DUMMY!
they are even thinking of Pre-viewing them
May your dreams be filled with Pony
...and not Birdemic.
:D
If we start previewing, I want in.
There is not enough pony to erase that dummy.
Nonsense.
just think of twi as the major again.
That makes me feel better...
G'morning

Rock 'em Sock 'em, the movie
Sumica, that's not the movie he chose
starring hugh jackman
ah
he chose Spider's Web, like DSN said
I can't tell if that commercial is serious, or an intentional joke
btw Incase you did't notice this is live tv.
THe ads suggested as much.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mmcGVe5LDs&feature=player_detailpage

O'Bama
I DESPISE THAT FOAL
when offensive humor isn't far enough, tosh takes it to the next (absolutely hilarious) level
/me would love to put a few rounds through tosh's neck.
now now
srsly
Those aren't the droids you're looking at...
you have to realize his schtick is taking everything way past the point of taste
I don't care about taste.
He doesn't even know what he's talking about.
I undertsand Tosh, He goes for the throat.
I love how every one is still hipeing 4g when cureently 4g might get shutdown due to in interfering with milatary gps
They are getting in while they can?
I can respect people going for vitals, but he doesn't go about right.
you're being vague
Finally, Metallica is on.

*sigh* US advertising saddens me at times.
the gyrobowl
*sigh* Capitalism saddens me at times.
you should see our infomercials
all advertising saddens me all the time
the magic bullet
Not nealy as odd as some Japanese ads...
or the baby bullet
our infomercials have trope entries
that's how awesome they are
The Baby Bullet gives me the shivers.
I did like the remix of slap chop.

back up
nice comeback
oki Desktop pony came up and twilight is still wandering around but I cant find her.
nm
My Rock in Rio stream is skippy :<
I've already heard the two Silva Hound songs, but the first one sounds interesting.
poor stage hand.
EQD
Y U SO SLOW
aaand we're live! (on highway to helsinki atm)
love it when I have to commute 50km per direction everyday
sounds FUn
it is quite
I wonder if his arm gets sore after a while.
I normally would be on the bus but my mom has almost the same commute so she drops me to helsinki and I use the bus to get to the polytechnic
cheaper fares when you're travelling in the same zone
I dont even think it's 50 mi across the whole valy here.
heh
Finland: land of the long distances
bad trafic is it takes 30 min to get home instead of 15
pretty much everything is far apart from each other
about an hour from home to city centre by bus
longer by car
that seems backwards
we're at the end of the highway right outside the zone and it's gridlocked
bus lanes get priority at morning and afternoon
ah
got to hop out soon to move to the local traffic, might make it to the earlier one at this rate
later :3
take care.
I find my self wondering how many are actaly watching here still.
oki night all.

Is anything going on right now/
*?
confound this EQD, it takes ages to go through everything
heh
Quiet in here
we've ran out of ponies
there are no more ponies
There are always ponies
o.o]
o.o
Ahoy
guess what
I went to the pink aisle
I walked away with almost whole manecast except twi
I shall scour for it on a later date!
how was your poker face
Good, didn't even need it
/me doesn't bother with the poker face.
I even talked to the cashiers for a while
I look like I'm tired and PTSD'd.
about the show
I don't need one. :D
I really missed a lot of the first episode when watching it on livestream
hi
Hello random pony
From Australia
hai
Aww it left :-(
OH, there's life in here!
>_>
<_<
Admins are always watching
I defied the thing known as he Pink Aisle
And bought ponie
Wonder how many bronies we have in the Netherlands, only ones I know are my school friends
If I was at home, I'd get you stats...
I hope I got the correct ponies
Xeross: if you pm MakerDusk, I'll get it sent to you later today
Dusky, how far off are you getting all the commands this irc network supports on the webby?
Oh... you mean all those secret pages we have hidden on our website
Yeeees :P
Also
I'm missing Pinkie...
:(
I got RBD tho
Tell all
It's easier to have them on the web page than on Irssi xD
I got all main six except pinkie
Zaco is working hard on the website
The channel listing with built in flash client is pretty sweet
You running it on wordpress/joomla btw?
Or something completely different
I also need to get Cheerilee as it's part of the set :P
I honestly can't remember what he was using to build it
OHai Luna
07,1Ohai
I bought ponies :P
07,1ponies :o
07,1which and where?
I'm missing pinkie from mane six, might get cheerilee as well
Blindbags from Stockmann
07,1did you take any pics yet? :)
Nope :P
07,1why not
Just got them out of the bags xD
07,1ooh :)
07,1well pics must be made!
And I've been bothering Dusky :3
XD
07,1bothering dusky hmm
All bother Dusky eventually ;-)
As long as you don't cause enough trouble that I have to open up a file on you, it's all good.
07,1I would never do such :)
:3
a text file?
I should hope not.
paper cuts all around
Morning
MeteorVenture: I'm partial to PDF files
I shall need blind bag #1 and #13
aka Pinkie Pie and Cheerilee
Dusky, mind poking Zaco about protecting the e-mail addresses on the front page?
Just something that caught my eye when I had a look at the source
O_o
Thanks for the heads up, Diftraku!
With something like http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/
So the spam bots won't get it
No probs, I have an OCD over these xD
So does he, that's why it's taking so long
/me is almost tempted not to tell him, so that it doesn't take even longer...
Yay, done work.
Now onto caffeine procurement
heh
Just a word of advise: having something like Wordpress handling the dirty work of managing the content makes it a ton easier than just having to manually update the templates and stuff
I know
Even if it's just static pages xD
(But don't let on that I can do websites)
:P
holy...
Ep1 biggest age group: 1317

That skype voice pack
Luna, http://i.imgur.com/idkhn.jpg
Diftraku: So much geekyness in that picture xD
:P
Is the WoW mouse actually comfortable to game with?
That mousemat is actually great
It is
If you got a big hand
Forget the mouse
It takes a while to get used to
The ponies are the real prize :P
:P
Mine's average sized I'd say
My keyboard/mouse/mousemat is all Razer
But all-in-all, the manliest thing I did this week
Shit, yeah, I should've mentioned the ponies first
And it's still Monday!
They used the same mould for both Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy?
HOW DID I NOT SEE THAT THE HAIR WAS WRONG
'Later
07,1So

08,1so what's up? lol had lots of messages to check through neh? >3>
Eeyup.
>only away 2.5 days
>2000+ messages
Was fun to read.
08,1XD
You guys spam so much in modchat. :P
08,1so many random conversations
pssssh
Sometimes I wonder why I bother going through them... then I fave so much stuff...
08,1I had 1600 pony pictures to look through the other day. ;P that's after letting it store up for a little over a week though
Hi Fluttershy`
1600?
why?
You might have more pictures than me..
XD
MFW after I've been on dA for 6 months and realized what those buttons do when you view someone's gallery
where do these things store up?
2 :P
08,1I see the cool pictures before they reach EqD XD
Lol
08,1Just go ahead and add me
Whats your username?
Do want
So bad
08,1Oh teh lol <3
Ok, I did
Btw.
5600+ images in my inbox
XD
lol
And growing fast
08,1wow
I cleared my inbox last week
rofl
I dont know what to do with them all
FAAAAVE
I wish I could save them all to my computer at once
Lol
hey fluttershy do you like .hack perchance?
It's so adowwable
08,1o-o lol
Not sure what to think of that Diftraku
XD
08,1mfw I'm having a serious rp over text-messaging, and I am running out of space on my phone and really want to save the messages to my computer ;____;
The reminds me.
I lost my phone. >_>
08,1You what? D:
08,1That's not good at all!
Lost your phone.. A smartphone?
i'm feeling generous.. so copy/paste everything to my msn and i'll copy/paste it back on your computer
Yeah, woke in the field on Sunday, phone was gone.
lolol
08,1MeteorVenture it's not so simple as that, blegh. There's a way to do it, it's just sloooow lol
phones are pretty inconvenient
08,1sometimes
08,1sometimes they're super convenient
08,1just depends :P
08,1it was made for communication
08,1and it does that well at least XD
08,1them phones were made for talkin' and that's just what they'll dooo~
lol ya and if i get a phone.. i hope it can still do that
Smartphones were made so that people could do stupid things
Lol
08,1I have a little blue slider phone with a qwerty keyboard XD It's adorable
like cleverbot
i do but i don't use it socially
And one of these days them phones will talk all over you?
Ah
08,1<3
i have made a couple comments and stuff here and there (like 3 over the 2 or so years i've had the account lol) but i haven't even watched anyone or anything like that
Of course, I cant draw :P
i use youtube and more recently facebook for that
Hmm
I dont really like to use Facebook
oh i hate it
I only have an account on there to keep in touch with a couple of friends
but i don't get to choose where people hang out
Hello Bronystate!
Hey Apokalipse
I
use facebook for birthdays
Because I suck at remembering dates
Lol
I want to get more social with other bronies. But im certainly not gonna use facebook for it
I only made a facebook a couple of months ago because one of my friends left my school.
Prick.
Ponychan I dont even understand
i actually made my DA for less honorable reasons to begin with.. and i hope that isn't basically permanently in my account history lol
08,1facebook is overrated
08,1>>
I use this place to be social with bronies :p
08,1Skype is much better
I have like... 5 people added on Skype
only 2 of those actually use it
once i know that i might actually use my DA account eventually
I havent even downloaded Skype yet
08,1I use it because I have to actually lol
i only really use skype for my brothers
I use it to talk to a Malaysian and sometimes a brit
true story
:p
I don't ever actually friend request people on facebook, they can request me if they want to be on my list.
dari i know what you're thinking.. but you're still gonna have to friend me first
MeteorVenture: Wut?
i'm just joking around
:P
/me throws a muffin at MeteorVenture's head
I dun geddit.
Dari, he's playing hard to get.
*eats it*
08,1>>
I'm hard to get!
08,1we can't kick anybody
anypony*
08,1>>
Orlynao?
08,1yes
08,1it's been a problem for a few days
the thing is if you add me that means that you're the one that wanted to be my friend:P it's a joke about power struggles and pride
08,1ever since you set us to +v
Ok, fixed.
08,1hmmm
08,1time to try then
I just noticed that it would then be impossible for me and dari to befriend ourselves on facebook
08,1Okay it works ^^
Haha, we're the same in that sense then?
Sort of. I'm not on facebook long enough to actually search for someone and befriend him
If I ever go on facebook I wonder what I'm doing there and go somewhere else.
>invited to part next Saturday
your little test costed me much mental anguish.. huh.. i just realized how anguish looks kinda like angus.. and now i'm thinking about burgers
>don't know the person who's house it is
O_o
party*
/me dances
whose*
Are you going to attend?
Not sure.
If some people I know are going, yeah, I suppose.
Though to be fair I've had a good time at parties when I didn't know anyone there.
Was a bit awkward to start with however. XD
fluttershy your little kick made me thing about burgers.. i hope you're happy.. i'm gonna be fat and it's all your fault
it's just logical tbh
/me 8enjoy her good old-fashioned meal of biscuits and gravy. She looks up, blinking innocent, mouth full, "Huufmm mmm?"
08,1enjoys, inoccently* > >)
08,1innocently * )
08,1SPELLING CURSE )

remove curse reminds me sooo much of exile

08,1biscuits with a sausage gravy is teh bomb~
/me says nothing and just stares
06,15Ohay people
08,1trolololo <3

08,1mmmmm
06,15Those are all three good things!
08,1YES
08,1yes they are~
06,15I'm replaying Wind Waker for the first time in a couple of years.
08,1OMG
08,1I love that game!
/me squees
06,15It's awesome, yup. I'm about to go in to the first boss
08,1<3 first boss
08,1have fun!
06,15Dunno why people don't like the sailing in the game, I think it's relaxing
no one knows this game eh? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNu1ak-FXvM
08,1>> looks... boring to me lol
no one knows my childhood favorites D:
06,15Thanks <3 I'll be back in a couple of minutes.

Comment on that youtube video: "It's cool to see how Spiderweb Software's games have evolved and how some features﻿ remain the same."
SPIDER'S WEB!
Best film ^
08,1o-O
08,1huh?
08,1by the way
08,1the other day when I asked what was so bad about Babes in Toyland... why did nobody tell me /why/ it was so bad?
lol btw more recently spiderweb software finally got a game on steam :D
Ich bin hier
avadon
I need to watch babes in toyland still
I herd it's on youtube
babes = babies? or women? or some other third thing?
Make sure you watch the live action version thingy,
It's the bad one.
or pigs?
08,1MeteorVenture lol
08,1I don't think they mean 'pigs'
Which one was streamed here?
I haven't a clue, Venture. I watched the movie, and I have no clue what the "Babes" reffered to.
One second, Apokalipse
but i have to say.. exile has one of the best storylines ever lol
I don't know if the other version is live action or cartoon
alright thanks hero lol
Oh, I think they're both live action
But it's the 1986 version.
Should I watch it?
It matters Apokalipse; how much self torture can you endure?
Oh, it's that bad is it?
Eeyup.
I'll watch it. Not right now though
The sheer horribleness put at least two of our members into a fit of depression.
:I
It's not the funny kind of bad, it's the "Oh god is this ever going to end" kind of bad.
Do I need to watch it all?
I wouldn't. Not again. :P
oh btw fluttershy.. exile is basically an old open-world RPG that actually felt pretty huge and the storyline was epic.. it's not boring! it's just old
just old :(
How well has it aged?
lol well it probably doesn't run well on newer computers.. it's been remade already to keep up with newer computers (so it's not unstable or just not working) and it's about to be remade again soon
and he's changing a few things like the skills and traits and such.. the storyline is staying the same though.. anyway i would LOVE to see a new game that's like that old game
>mfw Diftraku chose the same time as me to lurk on Lauren's DA profile
:P
cause in new games i can't attack friendly people and have towns hate me.. i can't do that and actually break the game.. it was fun to do stuff that could totally ruin the game if you were to save it afterwards.. so you just make a few save files
Correction: dAWatch
like killing a very important character.. otherwise though you could actually kill said character to progress instead of doing their quest for instance.. but who knows what that means a bit down the storyline
but you generally knew not to just kill people lol.. they never revive ever
greetings from the future, everypony
Greetings from the present
but there was an editor to bring important chars back to life or give you certain key items or something if you screwed everything up somehow
>mfw i read that as broodling
Bahaha. This amuses me, I never noticed this before.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUIovuh9gU4&feature=related
I'm going to watch babes in toyland now. MY BODY IS READY

i'm gonna watch that my little pony movie eventually
my body is unsure
Yesh Apokalipse

That's the one.
Nnnn.
Kind of.
Damn it... my body is NOT ready

It's horrible. Turn back while you still can.

Yarrrp.
his hair threw me off i guess.. and continues to
I know right? XD
Would "Geppetto" be a B Movie?
Because if so it may save you from Birdemic if I ever get the B Movie pick.
free willy is a B movie
The boss is a perv. Great. This movie started off swell
Oh gog you're really watching Babes in Toyland alone/
Good luck.

NO MAKE IT STOP
well not sure if i should but if you want to we could watch it in a synchtube.. but we would have to start over lol
I have no idea what synchtube is
or i would have to catch up while you wait a few mins
Meteor, you'd really watch Babes in Toyland just to support Apokalipse?
as long as it's not a very nasty movie
What a friend.
But I'm okay with taking a break already
Lol, it's a childrens movie.
They started singing
childrens' movie*
lol alright then ya.. i'm interested
I'm still not sure what they mean by "Babes"
babby's in toyland
I'm on the second part 45th second by the way
How many definitions of "Babes" are there? Maybe one will fit.
THEY ARE WEAK LIKE LITTLE BABBY

hero, do they sing a lot in this movie?
Yes Apokalipse.
All the time.
God... damn... it
I hate crappy singing
The singing. It gets worse. BUWAHAHAHA
apparently i love crappy singing cause i love the CMC theme
I suggest we start watching the second part together MeteorVenture
The CMC song was a masterpiece compared to the singing in BiT.
Cant find Fluttershy's cottage..

If I knew how to program I'd make a Mac friendly Desktop Ponies, RP
I want desktop ponies to obscure my vision damn iT!
JUST FOR YOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUU

Finally found Fluttershy's Cottage
But... But
RP uses Linux, not OSX
I told you he's a pervert
06,15I could probably make a Linux desktop ponies, but it's too much of a time investment
moar ponies
/me goes to youtube
"i warned you about the pervert.. i told you dawg"
/me stares at youtube
/me forgets what he's doing
/me wonders why he's on youtube.

06,15Oh wow, herospirit
:3
Meteorrr how far into the first part are you?
It's like
no matter what ethnicity you are
06,15That's probably the least offensive thing I've seen on Youtube!
done with it now
that commercial has something to offend you,
:0
okay wait
06,15lawl
Load up the second part
HAHAHA THAT' COMMERCIAL
wait..
Go to the start
and we'll start together
no synchtube?
lol
RobotPinkie, if you find an offensive commercial at a better price, I'll kick a puppy and punch a kitten, JUST FOR YOOOOOOUUUU
... twi and pinkie are both smack in the middle of my chat
Oh yeah, we could also do that
alright that should keep things consistent
06,15I wish that were a real commercial, that would be so awesome
I know right?
Are you going to create the room?
Is that a real commercial?
No, Chuck Testa
alright just a sec
06,15It's a comedy skit, I imagine, not real, what with the channel it's on and the things at the end. :P
06,15It's still awesome, though
God, Twilight's hair was DIFFICULT to sprite, but...
Rarity's hair is FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE
i'm just gonna hijack this http://www.synchtube.com/r/FlankBook
06,15Oh wow, I can imagine
I'm just going to like. Work on her hair a little bit at a time.
06,15So Synchtube is working again?
I'll probably finish a dozen more ponies while working on her hair :P
you in there?
apokalipse
06,15Yep it is, nice. Wasn't able to use my Synchtube room this weekend
06,15Probably overloaded by all the bronies :P
apok you in there?
06,15Haha, watching Babes in Toyland I guess :P
RobotPinkie, I demand you come and share in our suffering
In my synchtube room
I think RP already saw it
I know
He has to suffer with me
Lol
You'd have to be either incredibly brave or absolutely insane to watch it twice.
06,15I was kinda disconnected from the room... it's not loading now
06,15oh, now it's back
Man
Feel free to come and bask in the glow of whatever it is MeteorVenture is making me play http://www.synchtube.com/r/JWLS
Looking back on the musical "Gepetto" I used to watch as a kid
Sad Drew Carry is like a sad puppy. :I
Damn, know those involuntary movements you sometimes get on your eyelids?
Anyone have that problem?
Yarp.
I've had it on my left eye for like two weeks now
Just cooonstantly
06,15That's weird... maybe you should have it looked at?
MeteorVenture
I thought you might want to know of something I just learned in a PM
"<Rainbow-Dash>: So you know what Chunkatuff is making me watch?"
"<Rainbow-Dash>: I have it muted. XD"
Its legit
CHEAAAAAAATIIIIINNNNNNGGGGGG
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGG
06,15Haha
/me does the tattle-tale dance
/me just invented the tattle-tale dance
06,15Come save us, Luna!
06,15PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF PONIES!
Lol, I just googled "Lyra MlP FiM" and got this
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnrkr2Q18v1qjmjvko1_400.jpg
/me is amused
Hahaha
06,15Haha, oh wow
What's the story behind Lyra having hands, sitting like a person etc?
I really like the exasperated Bon-Bon
06,15She sits like a person on the show, which got it started
AllisZero; it spawned from the bronies noticing she sits like a-
DAMNIT RP
06,15Ohay Val
2,14 howdy robot
YOU NINJAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Ah, gotcha ahaha
2,14 no stream? Does that mean I'm in time for House? :D
/me ninja-kicks herospirit with a large trout
You can watch babes in toyland with us
Yeah Val
on synchtube
......
http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmxfgx2hVN1qjotd2o1_500.jpg
06,15Yeah, House is in 20 minutes or so
Herospirit, if you thought me muting it was cheating
Wat
Im not even watching it now
2,14 apokalipse...may you burn in the seven hells for your heresy
tYou can still catch the last 8 parts
06,15Nah, House starts soon Apokalipse :P
Yaranaika
....I just noticed how cool Lyra's mane style is.
06,15I think Lyra is a pretty cool pony
Especially as seapony lyra
06,15She's no Harpo, though...
2,14 I don't know why, but I find seapony lyra amazingly adorable
Yes I do too
06,15She's irresistible
2,14 maybe because the Lyre implies a Greek mythology, which then can go back into Mermaids luring sailors to their deaths
And she's watching you clop clop clop
06,15>mfw apparently I can't spell irresistible, according to my spell checker
2,14 so seapony lyra just sits on the rock beds playing her lyre, luring aimless sailor ponies to the depths
http://a0.img.mobypicture.com/e0947525312fc08b7b20428e1fc12c87_view.jpg
NO GLEN, NO
06,15Giggity giggity
06,15She is watching him clop, so.... I'm not surprised.
Glen vs Lyra lurk off GOGO
06,15Alright, time for some Minecraft 1.9 until Luna gets here.

Whats with the timer
Whats with the timer?
2,14 that's when house starts silly filly :_
2,14 :P*
HOUSE?
HOW DID I NOT KNOW!
TODAY?
Oh and BTW, I wanna know, AHve you ever seen the rain?
have*
06,15On a sunny day? No, not really.
lolol
06,15:P
well I shall be back in 14 minutes
BRB
/me glomps RobotPinkie
06,15See you then
06,15:O
/me is glomped
06,15Feels good, pony
hey guys, is the countdown for the house episodes?
/me nods
well i made it just in time, my mom was fixing the laptop screen.
07,1i'm pretty sure I included music too?
yeah i can hear it...
Your mom was fixing the laptop screen?
By heavens
yes.
in the bottem right corner
aw damn it
the screen snapped off the plastic frame
07,1oh no...
and you could see all the circuits inside
07,1how did that happen?
well long story short
when my brother picks up the laptop
he has his hand on the top of the screen and lifts it like so
07,1>.<
and i was blamed for it all....
07,1laptops have feelings too!
Smart
but she done a very good job in repairing it
2,14 mine doesn't
2,14 it's a soulless monster bent on seeing me in agony
my old computer was like that...
/me likes this song
got my friends katana and smashed it to pieces
was a very fun day
.......
hoping to do the same to my xbox
Instead of like
I dunno
Selling it? :0
after halo anniversary of course
its fucked
it red rings everytime you turn it on
only i know how to make it work again
and even so, its a temporary fix
Whyy would you bring a Katana to something hard!
out of sheer boredom?
+ it was a very old computer
Katanas are sensitive, their blades get nicks and scratches so easily
Oh I don't give a crap about the computer
But poor blade!
the one my friend had (and sold) was very durable, and very well made
he is in current possesion of a particular katana that he brought for £125
by about december, its will be worth £500
:0
from which he buys more weaponry and sells off again
Does he buy them at auction sites and the such?
Looking for antiques?
he buys them from a weapons site
i thinks its swords and bows
i cant remember the URL
HOUSE
07,1oui

No lag for me.

Ohai everyone, looks like I made it for house

06,15No face mask, and now kid dies from infection.
What are this weeks movies?

What are those movies?

all i remember was alot of AFK people in the lottery
06,15This week... You'll see.... SOON!
2,14 the movies for this week are special, so we're saving it for the Thursday newsletter ;)
07,1longest intermission ever...
Why did we do it Friday, didn't we do it friday the week before?
2,14 we alternate between friday's and saturdays :P
06,15Nope, was Saturday the week before.
if the newsletter is out already, i checked my emails and i didnt get it...
pretty sure i did...
2,14 PM me your email and I'
2,14 ll add you
Guys you lie
SO
what's new?
Babes in toyland wasn't worse than spiders web
Pants
ooo
i know a really bad movie
let's watch Dragonball Evolution
06,15Well, we respectfully disagree, Apokalipse :P
It was a movie... It was bad, but at least it was a movie
even IMDB agrees with me
2,14 see, MrChang, that is a movie that is so bad it's hillarious
2,14 Babes in Toyland was just bad, as in physically painfull
lol well it wasn't all that bad imo.. it was probably about as good as something like free willy
08,1Now you're no longer alone, Luna! <3
07,1Hey!
Shut your traphole
07,1I like free willy!
Free Willy is great
/me brohoofs Luna
2,14 luna is never alone
13So ronery
You all overhyped babes in toyland for yourselves
lol i really don't like that main kid
You know what we need to watch?
08,1I mean she's not alone in here anymore, lol.
06,15Yeah what's wrong with Free Willy?
Birdemic.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE5dJDgZ644
13:P
that main kid in free willy is a punk
the MAIN KID
08,1Dum di dum di dum~
The guy who made Birdemic believes it's a masterpiece.
evenin' bronies and Sisnies
:0
06,15It IS a masterpiece!
the best part about it was.. michael jackson
what are we watching?
house
Know what we have to watch?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwTiu3typeY
i'm just saying.. be as cynical about free willy as you are about any other movie people say is bad and you'll see it
free willy is a classic that I personally love,
dunno if i used cynical right or not.. but i hope i got the point across
because it's also so cheesy
This episode is… something.
07,1ohai Guys!
Free Willy isn't good exactly, but I don't think it's fair saying babes in toyland is on par with it
07,1and now we wait for our candidate
/me is evil popcorn guy
@ AllisZero this looks pretty good for a foreign film, would like to see it
I haven't watched the first one but want to
/me hugs Luna "Okay!"
It's really good
I think we should schedule a Bronystate Bollywood Movie Marathon
Hehe
Alright, gonna go work on setting up a better wireless network
lol well that was if you set the "goodness" bar on free willy slightly lower and on babes in toyland slightly higher
Bollywood makes the BEST worst movies.
See you guys in a few
they come close
laters Allis
06,15Bollywood also makes the best BEST movies
:P
07,1Bollywood is awesome
See
07,1I loved Bunty & Babli
>does not watch many movies so i dont know what bollywood is
we DO need a Bronystate Bollywood Movie Marathon
A BBMM
SHEEEET IM LATE
HOW MUCH DID I MISS?
I myself don'T really see the charm in Bollywood
It's like the Indian hollywood
07,1one ep
idk what bollywood even is
is it worth watching?
It's like the Indian hollywood.
I get why people like it, but it's just not for me
06,15Oh lawd
They put out a lot of "So bad they're good" movies.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svOlz2ei4Yk
Speaking of Bollywood...
then i say we should watch the troll series
This is why we can't have nice things

OOOOH MYYYY GOOOOOOOD
/me does not want to watch the Troll series
everyone and their mother know of this scene
I love that scene
but not everyone has seen that movie.. but their mothers have
06,15Can't watch movie trailers, House is on :P
we should watch downfall later, the full things on youtube :D
:P
it's like the german show Tatort. miss a scene and you have no idea what's going on
This is awesome.
Hey guys. I need the opinion of bronystate on something
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064091/
we listen
Is that an A or B movie?
LOL
Because technically it falls into the A category if I go by the definition posted on the rules
HOUSE IS BAWS.
Clever House
What a troll
has anyone seen the story of riki-oh?
note to self: Never ask anything here during House
i watched that.. i actually liked it alot even though i'm positive it's a B movie lol
by production values of the time it looks like an A movie
2,14 yeah it looks B to me
who this new chick? (lolol)
I could never work for house.
who is*
But like I said, the rules say A
after all it's from 69
2,14 it's a 6.7 rating
I'd end up laughing at the things he does to dying people too often.
I would KILL to work for House
With all due respect IMDB isn't the best... the movie got nominated for a grammy
And from the people Ive asked that watched the movie they say it's good
egbert is a hrash critic
harsh*
Maybe I could catch him singing the blues, then my life would be complete
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdyAoSXF9LU
Oh and Val. Babes in toyland has a 4.9 rating
SCIENTIFIC TORTURE
we could do a anit-/war movie special with that and another movie
*anti
PLATOON
YEA BOI
How is that anti war?
Becasue Sheen doesnt want to be there
/me still wants Full Metal Jacket.
It's anti-war.
Seconds the Full Metal Jacket thing
Okay yeah, I guess it is actually
any movie where theres a ton of tragedgy, blood, and no one wants to be there = anti war
Ive heard people say Saving Private ryan is anti war
which it sorta is ina way
Yeah it is anti war kind of. I just remembered :p
anti war is practically any movie that shows the terror of war
while in the war
basically every war movie can be turned into anti war by careful analysis lol
Well that movie's storyline is basically that evil Nazis want to kill wounded, wounded get away because Tito was smart as hell
So it is anti war I guess
Hi Ghosties

Thanks
/me is shocked
06,15I was kidding though
08,1Hiya
06,15...not about the robot part
Hi Fluttershy
07,1Polarfire], I'm just going to ask you a series of questions for the first part of the interview and I want you to answer them to the best of your ability.
next thing your know you know you are gonna tell me Luna and Octavia are too.
just read both Timelords & Terror and the Mines of Dragon Mountain
Sure
07,1Do you have any questions before we start?
06,15Dead serious about being a robot.
nope, guess not
Roger That
07,1How did you hear about us?
06,15Sumica, you're blowing my mind, dude
I originally found Bronystate on EqD.
07,1When was that?
And I'm a dude
dude
One of Seth's regular posts... Around the 1st or 2nd week of June.
d00d?
yo
07,1How many movienights have you attended so far?
I hate it when that happens
Boyo
About 3/4 of the nights since the beginning of June... So approximately 11 or 12 probably.
07,1What do you like about our MovieNights?
I like the fact that it brings 2 of my favorite things, movies and bronies together.
i hate when MLP has a season gap
same
is just a short one this time
07,1Anything else you like?
the season split is going to kill me
which would you rather? episodes split apart or seasons?
I would like the full 20+ episode Season like last time C:, but I know thtas not possible this year
why not?
Oh, the S2 live streams also... I like having 2 streams also for Europe and the U.S... back during the summer I would usually attend both.
there's gonna be another 26 ep.
in 2013
duhh no?
07,1What is your availability for moderating?
Season 2 is 24 episodes long
if possible neither, but if I have to choose? between seasons
07,1poor girl..
And season 3 has been hinted at various places
Im pretty sure they said season to is going to be split over 2 years of 13 episodes each
and then 3
when?
not sure, I never saw the actual news, a friend told me, so Im not going ot bet on it
exactly
its your friend
no way.. i doubt that so hardcore i am practically opposed to the possibility of the idea of that notion
can you really trust your friend?
So it's lupis right?
but he tis be a brony and active on EqD
INSTANT DRAMA, JUST ADD DEATH
lol?
oshit
just b/c he's active and a brony doesn't mean he's honest
Quick give her an mri
lol hes my twin brother actually :P
I should ask him for the link
if there is one O_O
you can't say a friend then
just say your brother
true true
07,1How will becoming a mod effect your time spent on Bronystate?
lol house
we need sidecharacter-themed episodes
It will probably increase even more... I'm already on for at least an hour or so each evening.
yesh
i don't know
...
Did
it took me a while to even get used to the CMC
INSTANT HOUSE EPIHANY
07,1Do you have any experience with moderating?
Did House SERIOUSLY get an epiphany from that?
lol I belive so
No
07,1What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
No first hand experience, atleast...
07,1In other words what would you contribute to the team if we would hire you?
cut her open!
07,1As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
oh god
Hey guys,more house I see.Awesome.
what are they getting out?
07,1holy...
a worm?
NNNG
lol
06,15Haha, oh god

music on house = usualy the end of the e.
ep.*
ytpos
typos
I fail at typoing lol
JESUS
07,1correct
yay
Well... The primary reason I applied was to help out streaming season 2. For extra abilities, I would take on whatever is needed to move Bronystate forward, whether its maintenance, handling applications, etc. I am not nearly as tech-savvy as some of the staff here, but I know what I'm doing. As far as what sets me apart, I have been here awhile, I know how bronystate works, what the rules are, etc.
typoception
so who else wants to join us for D&P?
randall? luna?
07,12 more left
07,1..2 more

Ponies and dungeons? why no dragons?

07,1Any personal abilities you want to tell us about?
I prefer regular nexk ties
The "accident"
neck
Hey Revolver
Hmmm....
what accident
that is some awesome piano
spits out blood
FUUUUUUUU
O______O
so what is this show about anyways?
MY ONLY REGRET
he needs bendgay STAT!
06,15Presumably you know who that is....
IS THAT I HAD
dawww
...BONITIS
i thought he was gonna die
I can't think of any specific abilities to tell about, are there any specific abilities you want to ask about? heh.
AWSOME! House is on.
savant?
That would have been an awfully early death for a House episode :P
he's autistic
ends up like CSI herospirit
:0
07,1Nope, we were just wondering. This is your chance to impress us
06,15>mfw no one recognizes Dave Matthews
08,1double negative
08,1means a yes
08,1lol
Hey, does anyone know if Lyra has any color swaps?
Or you know, if she's a color swap of anyone else.
"you have a big tongue"
HOUSE MD!!!!!!!!!!!
HE'S BACK
...I like this autistic guy.
lol House
it's official
everyone else can just stop trying right now
07,1yes he is
awesome
Ah. Well, I have experience with IRC(I have my own server) and Linux (if it matters), I can stream S2 in HD, and I usually get along well with others... heh
MantisToboggan: love you!
.......
Mantis.
07,1What specific ideas do you have to improve Brony Movie Night and help increase viewership?
You are correct.
Souldul duet initiated
soulful*
then his fingers crack
lol
What?
ohai
"my leg's not a piano..."
That made so much sense, it's not even funny. Yet I still laugh!
Well. As far as improvements go...
lol so true
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz2hsvByNno
"I'd like it to be a piano"
i wanna learn to play a piano
i think this is really good Fanimation
I can play piano well, but I have trouble reading the music fast enough to do it. :I
same
I usually have to memorize the stuff well enough to play it
Yah, same here.
Which means it takes forever to learn a song XD
very true
younger house looks awesome
Younger House looks pissed.
I would set up more regular weekly streams, like House and Dr. Who. They help bring in more viewers for the regular movie nights, along with bringing bronies with even more common interests together. Also, maybe advertise a little. And for the S2 streams (I know it would be expensive) a dedicated streaming server would probably be a big improvement. The problem is setting up something that can handl
e 2000 SD, maybe even HD viewers.
younger house only looks 10 years younger
true dat
they didnt get a old enough picture from hugh laurie lol
Younger house looks like House... but /younger/.
/me is trying to get a non brony to watch house on bronystate
Will I succeed?
04WHOA
04HOLY SHIT
07,1Any other ideas?
04Is that
hey Ghosties!
GO FOR IT!
AND YES!!!
every little thing
04*Red* Foreman, and Dave Matthews?
is gonna be alright
06,15YES!
04Dude...
04So what's the story?
/me glomps Ghosties
That's all that I can think of at the moment.
He's also the Grim Reaper's Father
06,15Finally someone recognizes him
/me tries to fling Robot off...but can't -_-
how come house never does surgery?
04He weighs a *ton*
04GETIT
07,1Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
06,15Piano savant gets brain problems, is the story, basically
06,15or some neurological problems anyway...
04What is Red's character?
04Is Dave Red's son in this ep?
house almost gets his leg cut off
and now he has brain cancer
just can't catch a damn break, can he?
was who framed roger rabbit ever streamed?
04No, Meteor
06,15I don't know, actually, have only been half watching :/
alright thanks
04Then you're USELESS! >:O
I think I am level-headed enough to make good judgement calls where needed... But the primary reason I applied for the mod position was in conjunction with the streaming. I would love to have my own weeknight stream.
...Would that be A, or would it be B as a cult classic?
/me slaps Ghosties with a robotic trout
04Bitch, I'm transparent and formless
06,15Not when I'm looking away!
someone call ghost busters!
06,15I've played enough Mario 64 to know this
That means you can't actually do anything to anyone Ghosties :p
/me makes Ghosties think inside the box
/me is wondering how he managed to glomp Ghosties earlier
lol
da magiks
04I have magical powerz
04I'm like a deus ex machina
04Pulling convenient shit out of nowhere
07,1LunaTheForgotten!

I WANT TO WATCH THAT SO BAD, I loved trhe pilot but I cant get that channel anymore
Squid Automatic Weapon?
mayonaisse is an instrument...
Woah
DashWithRainbows
Walking Dead creeped me out too much, but Walking dead was filmed in my state.
DashWithRainbows: it isn't a BRASS instrument.
Oo Coolio
GO ATLANTA!!
I'm going to find a way to make music using Mayo.
Pennsylvania C: ?
So when anyone uses that quote.
the main character of walking dead is british i think, he is very good in the show
I can say "YES."
plus i loved walking dead, best zombie drama i have seen
"YES MAYONAISSE IS A FUCKING INSTRUMENT."
BROHUG

BRO HOOF?
"I'm going to hug you. Anything to say?"
Best quote.

07,1Alright, thank you for your time. That concludes the interview, we will pass the information to our streamer team-leader and he will contact you.

I like to ask that

O_O THAT WAS HOUSE?
WAT?
06,15Thanks for reminding me, WhatPayne, and no I haven't
EE-yup
LOL
06,15I should work on that, though

I thought that was a completly different show or movie

06,15I'm almost finished playing Splinter Cell 1

FLASHBACK
INCEPTION
BWOOOM
Yes it is. I just love those games, and not because Michael Ironside
PONYCEPTION
I think im going to like this episode
You are never too young to have a Vietnam Flashback
06,15Yeah they're legitimately good games.
DAYUM RIGHT
2,14 and then House was a Psychic
nam some stuff up
Those games are pretty interesting as they are really good, but no-one ever really talks about them
Ive always liked splinter cell
/me doesn't have the patience to play the original Splinter Cell
06,15Well, people talk about them when they then say "but I like MGS better"
06,15Completely different games, though
04...but I like MGS better
04Actually
04I LOVE MGS
y
Indeed. Not really that comparable
06,15I love MGS too, but it's not really the same type of game...
MGS games are more movie akin
04True, they're different
SC is the case of it own
I like stealth games, even though I ALWAYS GET SEEN IMMEDIATLY!!!
04It's somewhat hard to be stealthy in Deus Ex
07,1After this: FLUTTERCEPTION!
06,15Yay!
2,14 until you get the invisibility augment :P
/me sucks at being stealthy.
/me crawls through the entire game
04Depends on the Deus Ex
http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/funny-facebook-fails-c-c-c-c-c-choo-choo.jpg
/me shoots at random people in games.
LOL TROLLESTIA
04It's fairly simple in both the original and in Human Revolution, but I work better in HR
Epic trolling
/me loves the Cardboard Box
06,15The whole light bulb shooting thing can't be done in the original Splinter Cell, either.... PS2 version was so much easier
04Whereas in the original, I'm not that great
Cardboard Box is best disguise.
You can shoot lights in SC1 on the PC
06,15I mean it can be done, but people will notice much more quickly.
Trollestia: omg
04What Trollestia said
I love that image.
I need to pick up MGS 3 sometime
06,15Yeah, I know WhatPayne, I mean it's much harder to do in the PC/Xbox version.
Oh right. I've only ever played the PC versions
06,15MGS2+3 HD versions are coming out soon on 360 and PS3, btw...
Do want.
Oh don't get me excited again
06,15Yeah, don't play the PS2 version if you've played it on PC, with any of the SC games :P
Awesome if you have a gamestore in the city that even has Final Fantasy VII between collector Items
06,15They are ridiculously easy
04Coming out on PS3
04Only
04Here in the US
Cant wait to play the Peace Walker and MGS3 again
06,15Really, Ghosties? :O
04Unless Hideo said otherwise, but MGS collection was Sony only last time I checked
06,15That's not cool.
CQC is best martial art
06,15Wait, so only the Silent Hill HD collection is multiplatform?
04Silent Hill collection was also only going to be Sony only until a mass petition convinced Konami otherwise. Now it's coming to 360 as well
WOAH
A petition that actually worked?
04Yep
Le gasp
04I know, right
should I buy Silent Hill 2?
04Yes
04Yes
04Yes
04Yes
04Yes
I always wanted to play one
2,14 I think ghosties is trying to tell you to buy it
Is there Silent Hill 1 in that collection?
06,15So close to kicking you, Ghosties :P
04Get Silent Hill 2. If you're a fan of horror, GET IT
06,15lolol
Was the petition instigated by fans, or some official force?
06,15Yeah, SIlent Hill 2 is AMAZING
04I think fans
I already have SH 1 & 2
Wow.
I mean 2 & 3
Never played first one
I've never played any Silent Hill games.
Colour me impressed. :P
06,15Silent Hill 3 is also great, btw
well lucky me there's a shop with the old SH2 extended with Maria chapter
04Yes, Silent Hill 3 is also amazing
04Not as good as SH2 IMO, but still great
Which is why I asked is the SH 1 in that HD collection?
04No, it's not
should I get SH2 normal or extended?
04It's just SH2 and 3
04Extended
Metal Gear>Silent Hill, imo
04Extended is vanilla SH2 with extra stuff
06,15Yeah, they have no plans for making any HD versions of PSX titles, unfortunately
/me is obviously trolling
lol @foreman
Oh wow eff this, 6 PM

Dunno, Dari.
My nome is a combination, because my first name is a mess, but my last name is even more of a clusterfuck
Mine's not very complicated, but there's always that second of hesitation that I know means me.
Pany poni is best pony

2,14 we're glad you came cosmic :P
=D i love this place
CosmicChan: It's cool, just try to avoid posting, it's chaotic enough as is xD
and im amazed at how this place jumps to over 1500 ppl on sat
2,14 yeah, S2 really brought in quite the crowd :P
yea im sorry i had NO idea what D&P was...
i derped xD
06,15Done with the second dungeon, aww yeah
RobotPinkie: What game?
/me hugs RobotPinkie
06,15Wind Waker
/me hugs Flaria back

OMG I LOVE ZELDA
06,15Me too!
/me brohoofs RobotPinkie
and im jelly right now, WW is the only one i cant play >.<
the ONLY ONE
xD
/me brohoofs Flaria
06,15Wind Waker and Ocarina of Time are my favorite Zelda games.
Link to the Past for me.
i got OOT3d, links awakening and twilight princess on my list
06,15I kind of shift back and forth which one I prefer. The bosses in Wind Waker are pretty much the best bosses evar, though.
gotcha
/me sneds EspyLoops to the past
there ya go. have fun^^ and dont change anything important!
Oh, btw this is lordCelestia
lolz good job
just so ya know
y u change name?
reasons
im on other chats
tho i do love your new name
06,15I've played through most of Twilight Princess, but regrettably I haven't finished it :(
thanks.
06,15I really want the Gamecube version
i have a picture of myself too
im still at the part before the temple in the sky
I did rather enjoy Twilight Princess though.
2,14 I played about two hours of twilight, got bored/frustrated and never went back
LOVE that oc pony
and yea tp is a long one
thanks
OC?
Fun though
original content
ooh haha
thanks
/me didn't enjoy anything about TP
aww val y u like that
his mark is a crescent moon with a lightning bolt in it
;P
:D
=D
06,15Do you like any of the Zelda games, Val?
2,14 it just doesn't hold up to OoT
i dont compare the 2
2,14 um. I absolutely LOVE OoT and Majoras
i look at each game sepretly
2,14 Link's Awakening was also really good
OMG I FORGOT MAJORAS MASK ON MY LIST
2,14 yeah, and TP has serious control issues that frustrated me :P
THAT IS THE BEST GAME IN THE SERIES
lol
06,15Yeah, what I played of Twilight Princess definitely wasn't on par with OoT or WW
LA was awesome.
I found Twilight Princess to control fine
06,15Still quite good though
If you don't like the Wii controls, get the GC version
/me doesn't have a GC
zelda just impresses me with every game
Wii can play GC games
FreezeFrame: or, just plug a GC controller in the wii
obviously haah
ValtheJean: Wii is fully backwards-compatible
06,15Yeah, Link's Awakening is probably the second best of the portable Zeldas
2,14 blug...so now I have to buy the game again, AND a GC controller?
2,14 fuck that shit
lol val
2,14 it should have been good enough on the wii
haha
but it was good, i loved it
(tho nothing beats MM)
See, that's why I didn't get rid of my gamecube controllers when I traded in my gamecube for the Wii.
i cant wait for skyward sword
2,14 still, that game wasn't good enough for me to REbuy it AND get a controller
Hey all you sexy people.
hey val or any mod for that matter, how good of a network connecton do you need to stream during the week
i would volunteer to stream oncei get home from school
2,14 good enough that you can stream things :P
id love that
and hi flutterguy!!!
=D
OoooOOOOooOooooo a Flutterguy approaches.
2,14 well, you're welcome to fill out a streamer application
Streamers!
i dont think my network could handle those saturdays or friday nights :s but id love to help out during the week
Oh wait, wrong streamers :P
I wonder if someone is recording MAD.
val, could you direct me to this application?
=3
2,14 just send an email to bronystate@gmail.com and ask for one ;)
gotcha, thanks val =D
2,14 you're welcome
When my desktop is fixxed I could probably stream on Saturday's.(Probably won't be anytime soon though)
i defenatly want to stream tho =p
I'll tell y'all if it ever finishes
=3
awwh i have to go eat now =c
06,15You don't stream directly to the viewers, your network load will be pretty much constant.
ok
i really do want to stream
but ill be back in a bit guys
/me is afk
/me seems to end up eating chicken very often
Chicken is good.
I think so too
.
I love how Babes in Toyland was the first TOO PAINFUL movie.
2,14 technically spider's web was
I didn't get to see Babes in Toyland, so I guess I was spared.
DON'T SPEAK THAT NAME
2,14 but we figured it wouldn't happen again :P
So, who suggested Babes in Toyland?
2,14 I don't know
/me AFK's in anger
2,14 but if he shows his face...there's going to be some trident usage
And just think: What you all watched was the second of three remakes that were done of the original movie, which itself was an adaptation of the original playwrite.
/me reaches for his trident
/me reads Espy's words then pukes
How horrible!
And the first remake was a Disney film.
The third was a cartoon.
Mr.Rage-quit.jpg
YOU ARE TEARING ME APART LISA!
/me slaps Flutterguy around a bit with a large trout

06,15Pretty sure that means I win.
/me fries up the trout and eats it
Flaria = judge of that!
Then you loot us while we're unconscious and bury the bodies in the woods?
o-o;
06,15Nah, I'm not that mean. I do like fish, though.
Well, Flutterguy fainted first... so Vee would win, but he also fainted....
Bleh, I don't like fish.
Robot would win, but he wasn't even in the fish battle. :l
DRAW
06,15The only winning move is not to play!
:[

You know, I never really saw that movie, I just saw that one part.. :|
/me has her mp3 player and headphones
RobotPinkie, War Games was the title, right?
/me has his computer and new speaker system.
06,15Yeah, it is, Flaria.
I should find that, I haven't seen it in a while.
/me plays music with brain
06,15Good movie. Not the most awesome thing ever, but worth watching.
/me "You see, you stimulate this node here and you get Rock, and this node gives you Techno..."
/me "KILL THE PEGACORN!"
Too late, it left.

My little bro has claimed not to like them....yet he would always aid me in annoying my parents by switching the channel to The HUB everytime they weren't looking. Mother would look away, look back and see pony, and she'd put on a srs face.
Mondays are hugfests, Tuesday's are hugfests..
/me hugs Flutterz
Our resurrect spell needs more HUGS
why the F*** is there a pornies channel on irc.ponychat.net.....

anyone fluent in mIRC
My padres don't know I watch it. Or my two younger younger siblings. Just my 14 year old brother.
i love to shuffle :3
how i change my nick on mIRC?
my family now knows I'm abrony
CosmicChan, /nick newnamehere
=3
CosmicChan, it's hte same for all irc clients
ctrlx beat me to it. >:|
And I'd just grin and go "whatever do you mean, mom? :D"
thats my other name
er
and also i forgot about that...
I'm not hiding anything~
im silly
forgot caps
lol
Pony wall paper, pony phone BG, pony chrome theme, pony chatroom, EqD always up...
Goin' all out Flaria.
^ pony cursors and icons?
PonyOS
beat that
i want a ponyOS
legit
^this
Pony cursors.
Imagine an OS
No Icons.
that is 20% more stable
soon my computer is gonna turn into a pony
for 10 seconds flat
Flaria, pony cursors?
or rather, it boots in 10 seconds flat
like CHrome OS
Someone needs to design a computer casing with a pony shape.
nah, my Win7 can already do that :P
I've been looking into making music and fashion design, too. >.>
An OS that boots in 10 secs? WANT
ctrlx: yes.
I WANT A RAINBOW DASH HOODIE
Flutterguy: Yeah, that boots in 10 seconds flat.
doesn't really depend on the OS
and i would wear that proudly
Flaria, link me the cursors. and we can be a music team :33
WANT WANT WANT
Get an SSD and a good MB+CPU
back to oblivion for now though
Win7 launches in 10 seconds flat
legit
aww i miss cosmicchan.... idea!!!
so does Chrome OS
ctrlx: I'm terrible at making music, and I'm only learning to chiptune. Not even sure if I'm good.
thus my new name is born
because all it is a an browser
CosmicDashie, http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-scootaloo-has-her-own-ways.jpg
Flaria, i always get ideas for music but can never remember them because i was either high or half asleep. i've played around a lot with stuff though i just need to actually figure out what i'm doing and lay it out :x
idk why but that comic makes me all depressed =s
same
It's bittersweet for me.
it's nice, but still sad
yeah
/me holds back the manly tears.
but it illustrates the name CosmicDashie :D
ctrlx: Check yer pm.
=D
i love my new name
im gonna use cosmicdashie now
it ain't bad, kid
I used to just use Flutter
lol my steam name is still rainbowdashie
must change this

The First?
08,1Yeah, that should work
maybe I'll ask for it to be streamed on the Saturday block
/me hugs NewDCD
/me ponders the implications of such a statement.
08,1I think Val is the one in charge of the newsletter... but he's not on right now sigh
val defenatly did the newsletter
/me is plotting graphs and other assorted Physical Chemistry shite
i really hope i get accepted to stream.. i really want to =3
yeah, he emailed it again when I told him the picture conked out
The Pretender: as in the movie "Kamen Rider THE FIRST"
*cough* Val is a prick *cough*
I know Val designs the newsletter, but Luna registered me.
ohhhhhh
Fluttershy`, there is another stalker in my channel :(
rainbow!! how could you say that about a mod D:
the mod powers gonna smite you
xD
Its complicated

Everypony will

Such a shame
:P
y u no like val? D:
08,1Rainbow-Dash who are you talking about?
I find your lack of protection disturbing
CosmicDashie, its a bit of a joke
that did not come out the way I wanted it to
Sorta-
08,1ah never mind
Wat Flutterz?
lol flutterz
im so confused
gg Flutterz
Or am I the only pony here with a mind dirty enough to see it?

DID SOMEPONY SAY CANNON?
also that begs the question
o no
Wassssah Bronystate?
oh wait, im not on LordEquestria's persona right now
who shall be our Sarah Connor? and our Kyle Reese?
And no MoonDasher
why would someone need protection on the moo-
oh.
no one said canon
Because of the force of the impact, silly
I've figured it out
the moon is where Celestia keeps her harem
It all now makes perfect sense
actually lag someone did say cannon
LOL
but u werent here
lol
b-b-but Twilight isn't on the moon!
I'll be back.. again.
lag, y u no notice my new name
xD
Twilight is in training
They will all get MOOOOOOONNNNN'D at the end of the series
wh wait when did you change your new name?

Twilight needs to grow up a bit before she can visit Celestia's harem\
08,1DCDnator hey can you PM me the command for a permaban?
so Twilight's a harem recruiter?
I would
if I remembered it
LOL

Dashite: You would quote.

Diftraku: If I relax enough around people, I'm generally the same as I am here.
I'd have to ask the ponychat guys
Going to bed, Dermathil_ ?

but my interwebs is suspectfully beint throttled Imo
Mods asleep = post Ponies

Dermathil: It's self-explanatory :P

If you dont want to sleep tonight look it up...
No not scary
well, tbh, I can get freaked easily, sooo yeah
VERY disturbing.
just very.. very... VERY disturbing...
like deeply
in your soul
and mind...
I dont want to get creative anymore...
Seems to just be a song...
I dont get freaked out easily
At first, SuperBrony.
Oh just wait...
Then it gets..
strange.
Surreal?
OH DEAR GOD WTF?!
Yeah.

I love how we have the exact same mindset Flutterguy
Right?
/me cries on MoonDasher's shoulder

/me hugs Flaria, herospirit, ThePretender, Lagmobile, and Flutterguy goodnight and gets creative with herospirit.
Oh hey Flaria, sea ponies!
So I was not affected at all by "Cupcakes" but im deeply disturbed by a youtube video?
Is there something wrong with me?
:=]OPEN-MOUTH]
I was slightly affected by Cupcakes.
/me gets creative behind Herospirit

SHOO BE DOO
SHOO SHOO BE DOO
gg?
SHOOP SHOO BE DOO
I started laughing maniacally at cupcakes. .______.
:=]CREATIVE]
good games, or good going
What game?
/me is a terrible person
...oh
I read cupcakes. And honestly, it was gross. But nothing that wouldn't go away in a day or less.
/me hugs Flaria no you're not..
What LC said.
I was unfeeling the whole time
/me hugs Flutterguy
I read an alternate ending called "A Precious Rainbow" where Rainbow survives when AppleJack kicks in the door and kills pinkie with a kick to the neck.
and i love both characters
I read that too LC
Y'know what made me cry?
It made me feel better about it
It was still sad though..
Bubbles.
^Yeah?
OH GOD BUBBLES
I sat there and cried like a... a brony for a good hour.
BAM! It hit me hard from the back! FOOM! The fire was everywhere! FOOM FOOM! Blowin' up, made a big loud noise like BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!
Yeah, RBD losing her wings was really sad.
/me sheds manly tears.
Bubbles?
Bubbles?
Bubbles?
Not sure If i want to know.
It's a sadfic about Derpy. ;________;
I'm assuming Cupcakes with Derpy>
Do i really want to know?
no, a sadfic
not a grimdark fic
supersad fic
Not Cupcakes grimdark, it's just... sad. REALLY sad.
uber-sad.
So.. I'll shed manly tears?
yes.
Aw.
Damn.
Go read it if you want to feel sad.
Not dinky doo....
Sadfic? Is it about Dinkys father?
:'(
I'm compelled to read it. But I don't want to feel sad.
I didn't physically cry, but my inner self cried like a kid
There's an alternate ending to Bubbles, though.
Would it make me stab-myself-in-the-face levels of sad?
There's an alternate ending to every grimdark or sadfic out there
Simply Rarity is one of the saddest things I've read
It's about Derpy as a filly and her parents.
Ive always wanted to know what happened to Dinkys father...
I have that downloaded.
I'm going to read that tonight, Pretender. :l
30min~ GO
Confound these people, they compel me to read sadfics.
I dont know if i want to read it right now...
but i do want to read it sometime...
The CupCake chronicles goes deep into the investigation of RBD's attempted murder and shows RBD's cope with life without wings.
it's prety short
alright cyall.
I read part of tht
later Dermathil_!

Gotta say, pretty sweet.

I wish i could draw...
niiiiiiiice
Lagmobile: Isn't that a sadfic itself?
that pic?
Yeah
its more sweet then anything else
indeed
Dat Trollestia
Pinkie dreams Cupcakes and Dashie calms her
omg that pinkie picture
funny ^^
only really sad when youve actually read cupcakes
What's funny is that the Ponyville Cantina video was actually posted before the episode.
Ive read it
i think pinkies expression was funny
g'night everypony!
the intent of the comic was probably humorous
Bye Flutterz!
even thouh i dint care about cupcakes that pic made me cry manly tears
Like a man
How?
It was humorous
Daaaaaaawwwww poor Pinkie Pie :(
Not sad.
Cuz I am one

so I had to refresh the page
Well if people are interested in reading something tonight... SHAMELESS SELF PLUGGING - http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093133/1/bProject_b_bPKM_b
Warning: its sucks :P
Lol.
Lagmobile: Read it five times already.
really?
Lol, no. *troll face*
:I
But I'll give it a try right now.
:I
If Google Chrome decides to work...
Everyone stare at SuperBrony
:I
No im just wondering why someone would read it that many times...
:|
...say whaaa?
lolwut?
did you leave or something?
:l
had to step out for a bit because chat was acting up
and now I am lost
ah
Yay! I'm gonna be 4-0 in my Fantasy Football league!
Oh boy, time for some random chaos...
well you didnt miss much
*drinks glass from chocolate milk*
I'm 3-0 this week, and my opponent next week.... calling him incompetent is generous
FreezeFrame|Sleep: How do you play Fantasy Football…?
Drinks the glass only
Looks like we're in for a big ol' storm of /CHAOS/...
*thrws away the milk which then explodes*
Do you use your imagination?
Do you get creative?
No i got creative
Lol
Green is not very creative...
HERRRDMIND
Oh god sorry...
Dude, Lag we think the same. Seriously.
I KNOW RIGHT
/me brohoof
I was going to say it too, but I came in late. :[
Its kind of creepy
/me hoof
Long lost twins?
I guess. But it's still pretty sweet.
Depends.
This is annoying.
Do you believe inanimate objects that trip you are mocking you and you feel compelled to hit them and punish them?
Actually... sometimes
but yes
No way. I think that all the time.
Lagmobile: Wha? That's not a story about ponies :P
OH DEAR LORD
I hit my shoulder on the door, I punch the door.
No its not about ponies
I trip on a chair, I kick the chair :l
Flutterguy: It's not very effective...
i wrote it before ponies came into my life
Wrote what?
ǝ ʌ ı ʇ ɐ ǝ ɹ ɔ
Lagmobile: …I…I trusted you...
lol big mistake, right?
But sorry anyway
It's okay, but I don't follow the story...
ǝ ʌ ı ʇ ɐ ǝ ɹ ɔ
Green!
/me hugs SuperBrony64
/me is getting sad
Green is not a very ǝʌıʇɐǝɹɔ color
Darn you sadfic ;_____;
Why is Flaria getting sad?
Oh..
Oh god, lets not get creative please...
Okay, I'm reading it seriously now...
Simply Rarirty?
/me hugs Flaria cause it's only a fic..
Why not get ǝʌıʇɐǝɹɔ?
Its not my best work SuperBrony64
Green's a creative color herospirit!
Not /very/ ǝʌıʇɐǝɹɔ.
even though its my only work...
Lagmobile: You shared it with the class, now we all must read it.
Gah!
/me hugs Flutterguy
well i wrote it at 2 am and i constantly kept making edits to it the next morning
/me pats Flaria on the shoulder.
OMG, SCAR-Ls, in a Pokemon story?!
What's next, Orbital Friendship Cannon?
Supposed to take place on human earth
...that'd be nice :)
everything is more realistic
Wait, you wrote that fic?
yeah...
Did it suck?
Flutterguy: Yeah, that's why the username associated with it is the same as his name here :P
Haven't read it.
it sucked didnt it?
I'm reading another fic at the moment..
Was it ǝ ʌ ı ʇ ɐ ǝ ɹ ɔ?
Yeah it sucks...
Very creative hero...
It's good, I like it.
Because I like ǝ ʌ ı ʇ ɐ ǝ ɹ ɔ things.
...Okay that's enough creativity
But it seems a bit confusing to me :/
Who wants to kno if the spirit o a hero can explode twice?
/me sniffles and wipes a tear away
awwwwwww
what happened to my keyboard...
Oh I get it now, is it supposed to be Pokemon that come to our planet but are very hostile?
Flaria, what fic was it you were reading?
I have an anthropological, historical and scientific explination
Okay, it's good, but the biggest problem with it is that besides the mention of Pokemon, I don't see much Pokemon lol
its an intro, second chapter you meet the team
But the second chapter sucks...
I REALLY want to re write it...
But i really want to finish chapter 3... then along came ponies...
Then go ahead and rewrite it.
That would be a bit random :P
Flutterguy: Simply Rarity.
/me wipes more tears away
Well, looks like I won't be sleeping tonight
what part are you up to?
/me hugs Flaria
Night everyone
I just read Cupcakes... Q_Q
But this wouldn't fit in much with Ponies. At least wouldn't fit in as a good story by my tastes.
Bye herospirit
Im kinda juggling between finishing chapter 3, rewriting chapter 2 and watching ponies
night hero
Flutterz: Welcome to the club
Night herospirit
May your dreams be filled with Pony!
thanks... I guess
Flutterz, I'm sorry you read it.
So am I
Its a terrible filthy club filled with hate and remorse
I believe it's a good story.
Also Flaria no more sad.
NIGHT
Flaria...
why did you have to remind me of that fanfic
later herospirit
/me now has a 'Simply Rarity' sad
The story itself is rather well-written
The content is certainly disturbing, but the writer does a lot of work in making the reader feel every emotion as the story unfolds.
It accomplishes everything it tries to
brb
SuperBrony64, exactly
Which, is certainly the most important aspect of any story IMO
true
If there is enough sensory details, I could care less about the plot :P
/me is done
well, I'm gonna go TRY to get some sleep -_-
night everypony
back
Bye Flutterz!
what i miss? :P
Later Flutterz
oh
We were having a serious conversation about Cupcakes.

/me hugs #bronystate
/me hugs Flutterz
/me hugs everypony
Sleep well, everyone.

/me hugs Flaria
:(
bye Flaria
/me hugs Flutterguy
/me hugs FLaria
What is Flaria roleplaying as again?
Fire mage.

I don;t
Nope.

lolwut?
wut
yep
replacing nerves with fail
oh
also adding fart randomly into it
Except for the first one.. which should be song.

makes it even more annoying
It is made to be a annoying song
this didnt turn out the way you expected it to did you flutrerbro?

I just read Simply Rarity and I shouldn't have. Manly tears were shed on the inside.
And holy god, Google's page looks like "Don't hug me I'm scared".
Now I need to read it
You will shed manly tears Super.
OMG, Google...
If not physically, emotionally.

whoops change of plans
(i mean.. ignore that last comment i shouldn't have made it.. it's just confusing after the fact)
/me is confused
just take the second link and ignore all else lol
The piano in this... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwIsYP29OhU
it's about a song that's designed to be as annoying as possible
lol tht was kind funny tho today... my derp moment with vals name
Hey.
hey dari!
Pony swag?
07,1hey dari
I love this scene and what House says here
pony swag is awesome...and on my ipod
aaaand now I cant get that song out of my head...
ok im gonna go for a bit, l8r bronystate =)
Fetus hand
C ya cosmic
Megamix? oh shi.
2,14 that is the creepiest dawww moment I have ever seen
Best line
/me was waiting for Dari's comment
damn
Oh god the megamix is freaking awsome...
House eys.
cuddy got a 20 on a revive check
eyes*
my ears are bleeding rainbows...
House is a real sweetheart.
chase likes cameron
OOOoOoooo
Cutty can't math
06,15Cuddy needs to experience those other 9.9 times, seriously.
ignoring house right now... ponies...
2,14 lol
Lagmobile has the right idea
I...don't think i like this show
xD
By Celestia, that MEGAMIX <3
is nobody interested in the stream?
06,15I'm sure her argument would be exactly the same :P
House is one of the best shows ever
but House guys
House is amusing to me, possibly because the nasty attitude he's got is hilarious when you're not the victim of it.
2,14 watching House is like watching Live Action Ponies
But ponies, Dumori
I pony most of the day
I prefer Doctor Who. Much better doctor
screw ponies, they can wait
2,14 it's so epic it's beyond description
06,15Well, I can't argue against ponies, but I love House. There's always time for ponies after.
NEXT EP RIGHT MEOW
RobotPinkie exactly
2,14 House is synonymous with ponies to me :P
lol
06,15Haha, that and Doctor Who, pretty much, Val :P
They both bring joy to my life, so yes. :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk_MhVURLks&feature=feedrec_grec_index
2,14 eeyup :P
Watch it ^
wait
2,14 ponies are the reason I've seen the two shows in the first place :P
i've seen fran before!
I KNOW
06,15Well, I'd seen a bit of House, but now I've seen a ton more.
it's kevin heffernan's mom!
I'm still drawing the COLE TRAIN riding Pinkie Pie
from king of queens
I'm doing this.
I'm making this happen.
o.o
ITS COLE TRAIN BEYBEH!
The King of Queens was a good show
07,1kitty!
wait
Though I'm still on the Pinkie Pie part.
is she a ho?
she has a dick!
Yes.
That outfit is okay.
or a lesbian
Wait, what.
I've been working on Pinkie Pie for the entire last episode. :0
SHE'S FALLEN AND SHE CAN'T GET UP
wow!
she's taking the money
Shake the unconscious woman. Smart.
All senior citizens need Life Alert
What a who- Ohhhh.
why are you robbing a poor old lesbian?
I see what they did there
Herospirit, you are spriting?
Nah
Drawing right now
06,15Friends with benefits
lolgetit, friend.
2,14 that poor cat has seen things it can never unsee
so wait
this lady is a lesbian?
Oshit

wheres house?

This is a good episode
06,15Lady is as straight as a pony, I swear.
07,1yes it is
^Hahahaa
Problem Cutty. :D
/me brohoofs RobotPinkie
....
06,15Haha, I don't know if I deserve a brohoof for that :P
Well at least she's honest.
This lady knows how to live.
XD
I love this episode because it chages the setting of the show a little
HAHA
YES
06,15Haha!
/me huggles streamer
WTB Scootaloo chaos clip :3
Lol.
It's my favourite for an odd reason xD
House is trolling Cutty so hard.
What is Diftraku?
Problem, Cuddy?
06,15Whoever said this is a good episode is right... though ALL House episodes are good.
/me house.jpg
I did RobotPinkie.
WhatPayne: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDCDyQBFsF8
Everything has bad episodes. :P
x3
And you are right. All House eps are good
06,15Well, maybe in later seasons it turns bad, I wouldn't know
06,15Most shows eventually run out of ideas
07,1we'll see :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l76thgtOaKA&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL
06,15And for that I'm grateful, Luna <3
Luna

:p
inb4 celing cat
07,1oh dear..
Not gonna spoil but this is really good
...
House is psychic
06,15That seems bad...
or a mentalist
I like this episode.
So much.
or a doctor...
2Hey Dari
lol
Hey.
he's making the white kid be chase
xD
06,15Haha, oh wow, he's simulating his team perfectly :P
That... that was amazing.
Is that the indian dude from Bones?
HA
06,15Haha, way to not cause panic :P
:P
mass panic...
now if only House said bomb
06,15He might do that... just for a giggle.
Its not out of his character...
"Ladies and Gentlemen, while you're vomitting, I'd like to inform all of you that there's in fact a bomb onboard the plane."
2,14 it's always cancer with him :P
07,1that's his job..
that girl needs to shut up
inb4 lupus
even though im usually the one who thinks its lupus...
....
it's not lupus
IT'S NEVER LUPUS
it is some times
06,15I think it's blowfish poisoning, because that sounds delicious
x3
/me Celestia - Mellow dramatic.wmv
"I know how to ask if his sister's over 18 but I don't think it's gonna help." That may be the best line he's spoken yet.
06,15House knows every language in the world, he just doesn't like showing off.
07,1cause she took your money!
the ho starts to like her in the end!
2,14 dat skank!
What are you talking about h LOVES ahowing off
06,15She likes doing cocaine because it's a fun thing to do.
Wank off?
Wut
XD
Cocaine's a hellovah drug...
x3
"You're pregnant!" "I can't be...." "Are you a virgin?" "No...." "You're pregnant."
dat dave chapelle skit

06,15Did he just say "extra ass chromosome"?

And then everypony died
Dat zombie plot...

Dermathil: Shhh, I forgot.

just walk either left or right until you find a jungle
I've been playing since 1.0.3, so... finding jungles is more of a digging thing for me
Flaria, bought the game in 1.0

I ate at Long John Silvers.

ooooh
Pretty good :P
Not many PONIES are talking
yay seafood
You have to get into the spirit of the chat :P
/me is now a pony.
hey what the?
I see my magic is working
/me waves his new found hooves at SuperBrony.
Who's this 'SuperBrony' fella? Remember, it's 1864.
...touche
/me trots over to the fireplace and lays down inside, on top of the fire
also, quick, everypony, what sort of pony should I be?
unicorn, pegasi or earth
Flaria: GET OUT OF THE FIRE! THAT IS NOT FOR COMFORT!!
OHGODSHE'SONFIRE
IT IS FOR ME.
You should be earth.
I'm the pegasus.
My name IS Flaria.
/me douses water on Flaria.
There can be only one.
I'm Unicorn.
HEY!
/me flares up, evaporating the water and restarting the fire
/me runs for it.
Why'd you do that?
ThePretender: YOU JUST KILLED FLARIA?! WTF!!
I was just getting comfortable. :(
b-b-but she was on fire! ;_;
You can't restart the fire Flaria, you're dead.
I"M SORRY, EVERYPONY ;_;
You need to roll a 15 or higher in order to be reborn.
/me rolls a 14
Oh shoot…next turn maybe
I'm /not/ fire, I'm just a fire mage. :l
QUIET YOU! You're dead.
...we need a seapony
SHOO BEE DOO
We're in the middle of a desert in 1864 and you want a Sea Pony?!
aren't we in distress?
SHOO BE DOO
SHOO SHOO BE DOO
:l
/me calls upon the seaponies.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4TedkQP_hM
You know what, fine. Flaria, I've given you your lifepoints back as a DM FAVOR.
You only get one and you just used it.
:l
can I roll for some Mountain Dew?
The only DM I respond to is Chang.
And I never died.
ThePretender: Yes you may. You need 7 or higher to successfully grab Mountain Dew.
/me sniffs and turns away from SuperBrony64, walking back into the fireplace and snuggling the fire
/me rolls...and gets an 8! MOUNTAIN GET
Well, let that be a lesson to you...
/me knows snuggling a fire can't possibly go well.
*MOUNTAIN DEW GET
AllisZero: YOU ARE NOT IN THIS SCENE!
/me not in the scene but still absolutely positively sure hugging a fire can't possibly go well
You have to roll an 86 or higher in order to obtain a teleport spell that brings you to where we are.
Does the dice even go that high?
/me slaps ThePretender
Don't defy me.
@rollmeter
Why? ;_;
They can, if you're using percentile dice.
/me chugs his Mountain Dew is sadness.
That doesn't work in this chat...
I'm on my 5th loop of Pinkiequest :3
Whelp, going to bed everypony
Good night all
Flaria: You'll reach inner peace once you reach the 7th loop.

/me hugs Nittany_Discord
/me hugs Flaria back
Hiya!
You'll meet Nirvana on the 20th!
/me hugs back.
Thanks! Sweet dreams when your time comes
Hi.
hey, Nittany_Discord
Nittany_Discord: You're now the sheriff of this town.
/me hands Nittany_Discord badge
hey Nittany
I must be seeing doubles...
WTF my computer went into sleep mode.
Okay, you know what.
Everyone playing the game wins.
YAY
Flaria: You weren't much of a team player so you only get half the completion points.
/me does a victory dance
/me sighs
What is this, Portal 2 Co-op?
Sure. If that's what you imagine it to be.
But remember
It's 1864.
I thought this was 2011?
So much this; http://youtu.be/aYAGB11YrSs
2011?! You must be readin' them Jules Vernes what with using a canon to go to the moon...
/me is listening to Nirvana.
/me is listening to PMV - When She Loved Me

Somebody should remix THIS VIDEO
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT5F6LcwNEw&list=FL4XR30kDJY1eUdxH7O1ZCCQ&index=5
to be ponies
and rename it
MAD MAD (pony name)
That was lightning.
In fact, we just had a nice, close strike.
Speaking of MAD
http://youtu.be/_YYclpE16-c
I saw that on TV.
so BroNYCon is trying to get famous people for the next one
Then the ThunderLOLcats segment had RD flying for a bit.
They should get Lauren Faust
It bothers me that they named the pony in that clip Applejack
But that specific pony is awesome.
Also, I like this song: http://youtu.be/bMgByEotGpM
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygI-2F8ApUM <-- toot!
EspyLacopa: THAT'S NOT A PONY
if they get Lauren Faust
my mind would explode
It's also the full song.
They should get the guy who wrote Cupcakes on stage.
haircut was a sucess
ctrlx: Really now? Tell us the entire experience.
i took the buzz cutters
and took down the sides and back
and did a small fade to the top
then i shaved
Interesting…go on.
then i cleaned up
…and then what?
Know what we need? Pony Puppet Pals
now i am here
What we need are some CREATIVE puppets.
EspyLacopa, i'm liking this idea
Puppets that like thinking CREATIVELY
...no
nooo
NOOOOOOOO
/me dislikes creative things.
.....
/me dances on ThePretender's head
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgOeSnsddHg
And out of the darkness comes Xerion.
Hi
How are you Xerion?
...why are you dancing on my head?
unless! DISCOOOOOORD
EspyLacopa, A for effort. doesn't exactly work though :(
Good
a bit bored
Yea.
Listen to your heart, listen to the rain, listen to the voice in your brain!

Still listening to pinkiequest.

:O! my door is open!
/me starts to /explode/

/me starts expanding.
The best part about the Soup Nazi? He really did exist.
And was strict about his line in the very same way.
XD
But he had the best darn soup.
/me explodes once....
/me explodes twice!
mmmm, Jambalaya
Here's the real guy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXLQxIfPv8
...huh, guess you could explode twice
You probably wouldn't want to, though.
Unless you were a fire mage or something.
but what if you were a fire mage with water on them?
Maybe a Voltorb with a focus sash so it can self-destruct twice?
Xerion: You can't do that…you're not Fluttershy
/me shrugs
Does that even work? I haven't played with Focus Sash much.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVS3eI0s2aA <-- FLUTTERQUEST

/me swallows a custer bomb
I am GOING TO XPLODE TWICE!
I'm up to Tooting my way through a 13th pinkiequest
<3
So what's everypony up to?
my God, Flaria, I can do it maybe twice, not 13 times @_@
Damnit. now Im interested.
I'm doing great, what about you CloudRunner?
ThePretender: I'm just in a TOOT kinda mood today.
just watched epic in its purest form.
hold on and I will link
Also, I grew up listening to VG BGMs, so I have experience doing this for hours.
SuperBrony64 http://youtu.be/x_CzD0GBD-4
It better be epic, I just clicked it...
VG music is awesome
CloudRunner: You win this round…for now!
the Namco SOund Team are some of my heroes
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNDMEVJzvfQ <-- Flaria, Corridor of Cupcakes?
also, CloudRunner, this is EPIC
EspyLacopa: I'll switch around 11:15.
It's 10:53 now.
EspyLacopa: I love that song.
Never played Chrono Trigger before...
Because we watched Doctor Who last time I just have to link this.
