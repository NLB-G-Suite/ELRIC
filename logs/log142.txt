9 inb4 Skyrider I AM AMAZAWN
Fair enough.
9 most people quote a 3-year rule for SRW
There's also the licensing issues.
9 not to mention the fact that games like SRW take a hefty amount of time to develop
9 technically I should be working on my Les Mis project...been procrastinating all day, due tomorrow with a speech as well...and gotta study biostatistics to boot
9 but meh
2,14 lol
9 the roster is already jam-packed enough. They'll just give us awesome unit upgrades

9 No news yet on the release dates for Saisei-hen though

9 I'm putting it for votin'
9 BUT ONLY VAL SEEMS TO VOTE
/me votes for eva

9It's a great way to get familiarized with SRW
2,14 :P
9I might sample a few stages but that's it
TROMBE~!
well take care guys i guess i'm going to sleep

they're there. if you know where to look
i spent like $250 at quakecon on games
9 Oh wow wait
9 It's 15 bucks for THREE stands, and they don't sell them separately

9 Toy Arena is selling it for 30 bucks
Huh. SRW Anime?

9There are several
Which series are in this?
06,15Toy Arena?
9this is the OVA of the Bartoll Incident, which was later adapted in OGG for the PS2
it's just the Customs
9 also, for you: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_ap6UrDxkY
9in case you're actually thinking of purchasing it, look at a review first
ugh
9 if you like Kaix
9Kaixa
9I'd recommend you getting him first though
finally working
9Kaixa was released this month
9Faiz about a year and a half ago
9so Kaixa's architecture is much more advanced
9also KUSAKA RAPES MARI IN THE NOVEL
hey
06,15I might get Kaixa first, then
hg
^whoops
9 let me send you a review someone posted on /toy/ for Kaixa first, then
9or be a hero and get Faiz along with it

9Think of them as Ver.Ka. for Toku characters
oh but it works for THAT?
>_>
ugh
9 Kiwami Tamashiis are basically S.I.C.s, but smaller
works for me
now to change back
06,15Ahhh okay
9Same design, but about half the size
06,15Gotcha, then
9Version Katoki
i dont see the problem...
Hrm.
brb
random thought
beam coto
or rather it can just be in the background
9For example, this is the Ver.Ka.for Gurren-Lagann http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YF1tNfQVN8w/TFGUL6e9ImI/AAAAAAABIt8/QTbZT5AWYK8/s1600/1.jpg

9 here http://myfigurecollection.net/blog/1273
06,15I wish I were richer, then I'd get you the Agito one
9 also Pinkie: Tamashii web exclusives are expensive as fuck overseas
9Also man Kaixa is looking GOOD
9holy fuck those are a lot of accessories
06,15Still looking at the Kaixa one, but it looks amazing
OWNED
06,15Love how the feet can move, wow
9they're called FiguARTS for a reason

Whaaaaat.
9Kabuto and Agito got reviews by Angelus
9and Kiva, IDK
9Agito has few accessories...
9here
06,15Kiva isn't exactly my favorite, but at least it's not Den-O :P
06,15Haha, oh lawd
Aww yeah, rainbow dash cursor time.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ3wCbUZr-E
Awww. Okay.
this cold is kicking my arse
06,15I'm hoping his horn folds...
06,15Ah, darn
Hence I have hard time watching the english dubs :P
06,15just when I've hit enter, he says it doesn't :P
06,15Oh wow, you're not kidding... Now I want to watch some Faiz
Bag of grenades.
Nice.
06,15You're the one streaming, now?
"Let me reach for my... _banana bag_"
9also Faiz Axel is a tamashii web exclusive
9And I can't stream right now
RAIN. <3
9Supposedly Japan-only
06,15Damn....
9because you can only buy it on the Tamashii site
9but you can buy them in other stores
9as in, for example, BigBadToyStore has Axel Form in stock....
9...for 75 bucks
06,15Ouch, crap
9that's the problem with web exclusives. Expensive as FUCK.
9Just the NON-TRANSFORMING Ride Vendor of OOOs is 40 bucks because it's a Tamashii Web Exclusive
06,15I kinda want to try to get as many Faiz figures as I can, hehe
Imagine a to scale Unicron toy.

9 also if you're going to get several Figuarts, Pinks, you might as well get these http://www.shewsbury.com/2009/11/tamashii-stage-act-3-action-support.html
9I KNOW. CRACK IS CHEAPER.
9 and there are DBZ and One Piece Figuarts, too...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bETCusT5kNM <-- The Cat Came Back
06,15I think I might take up a crack habit instead, yeah :P
06,15Nah, KR figures are much cooler than crack
9That is the only thing
9 Pinks where do you live again?
06,15Sweden
Bit like playing warhammer: a crack habit might be cheaper but warhammer is less deadly
06,15So imports... might be a bit expensive
06,15I know quite a few Americans, thankfully
9 Shipping from Hobbylink Japan might be cheaper
i'm american! i can do american things!

Heh.
And hit him from the back repeatedly.
9alsoPinkie, as an alternative
I'm thinking of going back in there and just practicing the whole blocking trick until I've got it down properly.
Seems I need to go yell at my isp again.
The timing's pretty tough, yeah. I may run it multiple times just to get the hang of it.
Running away is for pansies. I just run around to his back and start wailing on him with my magic sword and spells.
I have no problem whatsoever with playing like a pansy. :D
Still failed.
Especially if it works.

2,14 yeah, and?
They aren't to be taken seriously
Also, some of their clips of liberals talking about guns sound frighteningly real.
Because if you do, what's down the road is the same train of thoughts that bring people to say that games like GTA are the cause for a spike in violent crimes (when they really are just becoming rarer)
2,14 sigh...you're missing the point...but it isn't worth getting into ANOTHER one of these debates
I dunno, I was thinking of getting GTA4
/me shrugs
That's depressing.

Power through the pain :3
Okay guys, watch this vid with me. It's some of the "best" scenes from a horrible movie. My friend told me to watch it, to see how "so bad it's good" this movie is.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwSTDzaZ234
Ladies and gentlemen
BIRDEMIC
birdemic.
Birdemic?
make it go away
XD
*swings coat hangers wildly*
DSN
the editing in Birdemic is downright criminal
guys i feel like i'm back in high school
Hitchcock's The Birds.
i haven't been back in high school since i was back in high school
LOL.
birdemic makes me ashamed to watch movies
i don't really care for birds
chickens are cute though :3
bok bok
D:
the birds
when they dive
THE BIIIIRDS
they make stuka bomber noises
bok bok bok
/me pecks at the ground
Thanks for streaming :3
/me scratches at the dirt
MAKE THE .GIFs LEAVE OUR HEROES ALONE
bok
Not done yet. have somthing a bit specal
Oh? :3
er, the highly populated highway
and by defend I mean swing coat hangers ineffectually
birdemic is soul-suckingly bad
the main "actor" deserves a prison sentence
don't
please
Don't go there.
Babes in Toyland nearly broke us
We're not trying to compete.
Birdemic would kill us all
I know. And Birdemic...
Stream is off?
the best part about birdemic
is that the director genuinely thinks he made a good movie
This makes "The Room" look like a fuckking masterpiece
ok back up
Aw damn, Jeff Dunham.
"The Room" is a fucking masterpiece.
and yes normandy wallpaper
the room is a special movie
....
it is to date the only movie that has made me burst out laughing at the FIRST line of dialogue
wut
ie: now.
About now, yeah
Kay.
/me hugs herospirit
that my ramen is cooled down now
The dialouge in Birdemic is genious
do want
the "dialogue"
ftfy
G'night.
oh i see, i'm last D:>
"Hi. The eagles killed our friends. Do you have a phone?"
Sleep well all of you! :3
is that song...
ZZTop?
they go to the beach
and the movie ends
XD
I've looked up Birdemic.. and I'm already disappoint.
The trailer for the movie is great.
"MEET ROB!" *rob walks in* "HI."
did you see the clapping scene
hey my guilds name
Fun with puppets.
seriously the worst part of birdemic is the editing
deserves to have his license revoked
his BREATHING license
Passion. That would be FLuttershy.
VE GO
/me doesn't have a phone, but wants the app.
yeah birdemic is a rare level of bad
No words can describe.
plan 9 level
utter incompetence combined with optimism
it's a beautiful combination
Birdemic
herospirit do it.
I heard a roomer DSN
Are you saying there is a filmm that comapres with PLan 9?
A ROOOOOOOMER
saturday
in 2 weeks
Alright.
I think
I still want labrinth.
I STILL WANT CUBE/APOCALYPSE NOW
Is Full Metal Jacket in the running?
Lol Full Metal Jacket would be awesome.
if one week I am feeling evil
that would be the worst BMN ever
OMG. That was SILLY beyond BELIEF.
That dummy.
DSN
I heard.
The maker of Birdemic.
a roomer
yeah
Is working on a sequel.
babes in toyland
/me never saw one fucking babe in toyland
didn't "get"
THe dummy got a haircut.
the "Worst Movies Clause"
not even the next day
Welp, I got to go now.
Bye herospirit!
Night everyone
AHHHHH! SCARY DUMMY!
they are even thinking of Pre-viewing them
...and not Birdemic.
:D
If we start previewing, I want in.
There is not enough pony to erase that dummy.
Nonsense.

I don't care about taste.
I undertsand Tosh, He goes for the throat.
They are getting in while they can?
I can respect people going for vitals, but he doesn't go about right.
you're being vague
Finally, Metallica is on.
wow, that pringles face must have been expensive
or CGI...
*sigh* US advertising saddens me at times.
the gyrobowl
*sigh* Capitalism saddens me at times.
you should see our infomercials
all advertising saddens me all the time
the magic bullet
or the baby bullet
our infomercials have trope entries
that's how awesome they are
The Baby Bullet gives me the shivers.
I did like the remix of slap chop.
I thought this joke had /died/ long ago

back up
nice comeback
oki Desktop pony came up and twilight is still wandering around but I cant find her.
nm
poor stage hand.
EQD
aaand we're live! (on highway to helsinki atm)
it is quite
cheaper fares when you're travelling in the same zone
I dont even think it's 50 mi across the whole valy here.
heh
Finland: land of the long distances
bad trafic is it takes 30 min to get home instead of 15
pretty much everything is far apart from each other
about an hour from home to city centre by bus
that seems backwards
we're at the end of the highway right outside the zone and it's gridlocked
got to hop out soon to move to the local traffic, might make it to the earlier one at this rate
later :3
take care.
I find my self wondering how many are actaly watching here still.
oki night all.

Make sure you watch the live action version thingy,
It's the bad one.
or pigs?
08,1MeteorVenture lol
08,1I don't think they mean 'pigs'
Which one was streamed here?
but i have to say.. exile has one of the best storylines ever lol
I don't know if the other version is live action or cartoon
alright thanks hero lol
Oh, I think they're both live action
But it's the 1986 version.
Should I watch it?
http://mihaaaa.deviantart.com/art/Donny-S-216160201
Oh, it's that bad is it?
I'll watch it. Not right now though
The sheer horribleness put at least two of our members into a fit of depression.
:I
Do I need to watch it all?
I wouldn't. Not again. :P
just old :(
How well has it aged?
lol well it probably doesn't run well on newer computers.. it's been remade already to keep up with newer computers (so it's not unstable or just not working) and it's about to be remade again soon

Oh I don't give a crap about the computer
But poor blade!
the one my friend had (and sold) was very durable, and very well made
he is in current possesion of a particular katana that he brought for £125
:0

Does he buy them at auction sites and the such?
Looking for antiques?

Pants
ooo
i know a really bad movie
let's watch Dragonball Evolution
It was a movie... It was bad, but at least it was a movie
even IMDB agrees with me
2,14 Babes in Toyland was just bad, as in physically painfull
08,1Now you're no longer alone, Luna! <3

07,1ohai Guys!
07,1and now we wait for our candidate
I haven't watched the first one but want to
/me hugs Luna "Okay!"
It's really good
Hehe
Bollywood makes the BEST worst movies.
See you guys in a few
they come close
laters Allis
06,15Bollywood also makes the best BEST movies
:P
07,1Bollywood is awesome
See
07,1I loved Bunty & Babli
A BBMM
I myself don'T really see the charm in Bollywood
It's like the Indian hollywood
07,1one ep
is it worth watching?
It's like the Indian hollywood.
I get why people like it, but it's just not for me
06,15Oh lawd
They put out a lot of "So bad they're good" movies.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svOlz2ei4Yk
Speaking of Bollywood...
This is why we can't have nice things
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyophYBP_w4
OOOOH MYYYY GOOOOOOOD
but not everyone has seen that movie.. but their mothers have
06,15Can't watch movie trailers, House is on :P
:P
This is awesome.
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064091/
we listen
LOL
Because technically it falls into the A category if I go by the definition posted on the rules
HOUSE IS BAWS.
Clever House
has anyone seen the story of riki-oh?
note to self: Never ask anything here during House
by production values of the time it looks like an A movie
I could never work for house.
But like I said, the rules say A
after all it's from 69
2,14 it's a 6.7 rating
I'd end up laughing at the things he does to dying people too often.
I would KILL to work for House
With all due respect IMDB isn't the best... the movie got nominated for a grammy
And from the people Ive asked that watched the movie they say it's good
egbert is a hrash critic
harsh*
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdyAoSXF9LU
Oh and Val. Babes in toyland has a 4.9 rating
SCIENTIFIC TORTURE
And you act like it's the devils work
we could do a anit-/war movie special with that and another movie
*anti
PLATOON
YEA BOI
How is that anti war?
Becasue Sheen doesnt want to be there
/me still wants Full Metal Jacket.
It's anti-war.
Seconds the Full Metal Jacket thing
Okay yeah, I guess it is actually
any movie where theres a ton of tragedgy, blood, and no one wants to be there = anti war
which it sorta is ina way
Yeah it is anti war kind of. I just remembered :p
anti war is practically any movie that shows the terror of war
while in the war
basically every war movie can be turned into anti war by careful analysis lol
04That was fast
I hate when movies portray germans as evil people though, becasue they too were drafted and did not want to fight
/me cheers

:I
...say whaaa?
lolwut?
did you leave or something?
and now I am lost
*drinks glass from chocolate milk*
I'm 3-0 this week, and my opponent next week.... calling him incompetent is generous
FreezeFrame|Sleep: How do you play Fantasy Football…?
Drinks the glass only
*thrws away the milk which then explodes*
Do you get creative?
No i got creative
Lol
HERRRDMIND
I KNOW RIGHT
Its kind of creepy
Long lost twins?
Depends.
This is annoying.
Do you believe inanimate objects that trip you are mocking you and you feel compelled to hit them and punish them?
Actually... sometimes
but yes
No way. I think that all the time.
OH DEAR LORD
No its not about ponies
ǝ ʌ ı ʇ ɐ ǝ ɹ ɔ
But sorry anyway
It's okay, but I don't follow the story...
ǝ ʌ ı ʇ ɐ ǝ ɹ ɔ
/me is getting sad
Darn you sadfic ;_____;
Oh..
Okay, I'm reading it seriously now...
Simply Rarirty?
Why not get ǝʌıʇɐǝɹɔ?
Green's a creative color herospirit!
Not /very/ ǝʌıʇɐǝɹɔ.
even though its my only work...
Gah!
...that'd be nice :)
everything is more realistic
Wait, you wrote that fic?
yeah...
Did it suck?
Haven't read it.
it sucked didnt it?
I'm reading another fic at the moment..
Was it ǝ ʌ ı ʇ ɐ ǝ ɹ ɔ?
Yeah it sucks...
Very creative hero...
It's good, I like it.
Because I like ǝ ʌ ı ʇ ɐ ǝ ɹ ɔ things.
...Okay that's enough creativity
But it seems a bit confusing to me :/
/me sniffles and wipes a tear away
awwwwwww
No, they evolved like normal animals and lie along side humans
But the second chapter sucks...
I REALLY want to re write it...
But i really want to finish chapter 3... then along came ponies...
Then go ahead and rewrite it.
That would be a bit random :P
/me wipes more tears away
Night everyone
But this wouldn't fit in much with Ponies. At least wouldn't fit in as a good story by my tastes.
Bye herospirit
night hero
Night herospirit
thanks... I guess
Its a terrible filthy club filled with hate and remorse
I believe it's a good story.
NIGHT
why did you have to remind me of that fanfic
later herospirit
/me now has a 'Simply Rarity' sad
The story itself is rather well-written
The content is certainly disturbing, but the writer does a lot of work in making the reader feel every emotion as the story unfolds.
It accomplishes everything it tries to
brb
Which, is certainly the most important aspect of any story IMO
If there is enough sensory details, I could care less about the plot :P
/me is done
well, I'm gonna go TRY to get some sleep -_-
night everypony
back
oh
/me hugs #bronystate
/me hugs everypony
Sleep well, everyone.
Night then

I don;t
I don't.
OK then
RP Character? lol wut?

He has every power imaginable
nerf'd
plox
well, I'm out everyone

Bye Pretender
And then there were 3...
everybody's FAIL
everybody's FAIL
lolwut?
wut
yep
replacing nerves with fail
oh
also adding fart randomly into it
Except for the first one.. which should be song.
no that one is supposed to be fail
makes it even more annoying
It is made to be a annoying song
Lol -> http://browse.deviantart.com/?q=cupcakes%20pony&order=9&offset=48#/d3cdwcw

She says her favorite pony is Pinkie Pie.

06,15<Luna> Well Pinkie Pie is awesome ;)
06,15Damn straight!

whoops change of plans
(i mean.. ignore that last comment i shouldn't have made it.. it's just confusing after the fact)
just take the second link and ignore all else lol
The piano in this... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwIsYP29OhU
it's about a song that's designed to be as annoying as possible
Hey.

Megamix? oh shi.
2,14 that is the creepiest dawww moment I have ever seen
Best line
/me was waiting for Dari's comment
damn
House eys.
cuddy got a 20 on a revive check
eyes*
House is a real sweetheart.
OOOoOoooo
Cutty can't math
06,15Cuddy needs to experience those other 9.9 times, seriously.
ignoring house right now... ponies...
2,14 lol
I...don't think i like this show
xD
By Celestia, that MEGAMIX <3
06,15I'm sure her argument would be exactly the same :P
House is one of the best shows ever
but House guys
House is amusing to me, possibly because the nasty attitude he's got is hilarious when you're not the victim of it.
2,14 watching House is like watching Live Action Ponies
I pony most of the day
screw ponies, they can wait
NEXT EP RIGHT MEOW
2,14 House is synonymous with ponies to me :P
lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk_MhVURLks&feature=feedrec_grec_index
Watch it ^
wait
2,14 ponies are the reason I've seen the two shows in the first place :P
i've seen fran before!
I KNOW
06,15Well, I'd seen a bit of House, but now I've seen a ton more.
I'm doing this.
I'm making this happen.
o.o
07,1kitty!
wait
Though I'm still on the Pinkie Pie part.
is she a ho?
Yes.
That outfit is okay.
or a lesbian
I've been working on Pinkie Pie for the entire last episode. :0
wow!
she's taking the money
why are you robbing a poor old lesbian?
Herospirit, you are spriting?
Nah
Drawing right now
06,15Friends with benefits
lolgetit, friend.
2,14 that poor cat has seen things it can never unsee
this lady is a lesbian?
Oshit
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uqwlKyrUaU&feature=related
XD
ha
okay that was good
wheres house?
where'd he go?
o malay
This is a good episode
06,15Lady is as straight as a pony, I swear.
07,1yes it is
^Hahahaa
Problem Cutty. :D
....
Well at least she's honest.
This lady knows how to live.
XD
HAHA
YES
06,15Haha!
/me huggles streamer
Lol.
It's my favourite for an odd reason xD
Problem, Cuddy?
06,15Whoever said this is a good episode is right... though ALL House episodes are good.
/me house.jpg
Everything has bad episodes. :P
x3
And you are right. All House eps are good
06,15Well, maybe in later seasons it turns bad, I wouldn't know
06,15Most shows eventually run out of ideas
07,1we'll see :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l76thgtOaKA&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL
06,15And for that I'm grateful, Luna <3
Luna
/me meows at Luna
07,1yes?
Yeah but House has not run out of ideas yet
well i'm out bros. peace
Hello, little sis
Cuddy's plot
07,1what's with all the linking...
they forget the rules
uh oh...
:p
inb4 celing cat
07,1oh dear..
Not gonna spoil but this is really good
...
House is psychic
06,15That seems bad...
or a mentalist
I like this episode.
2Hey Dari
lol
Hey.
xD
06,15Haha, oh wow, he's simulating his team perfectly :P
That... that was amazing.
Is that the indian dude from Bones?
HA
06,15Haha, way to not cause panic :P
:P
mass panic...
now if only House said bomb
06,15He might do that... just for a giggle.
Its not out of his character...
"Ladies and Gentlemen, while you're vomitting, I'd like to inform all of you that there's in fact a bomb onboard the plane."
2,14 it's always cancer with him :P
07,1that's his job..
....
it is some times
x3
/me Celestia - Mellow dramatic.wmv
"I know how to ask if his sister's over 18 but I don't think it's gonna help." That may be the best line he's spoken yet.
06,15House knows every language in the world, he just doesn't like showing off.
the ho starts to like her in the end!
2,14 dat skank!
06,15She likes doing cocaine because it's a fun thing to do.
Wank off?
Wut
XD
Cocaine's a hellovah drug...
x3
"You're pregnant!" "I can't be...." "Are you a virgin?" "No...." "You're pregnant."
oh snap!
dun dun dun
cuddy has it too
And then everypony died
You're allowed to say wank during day time TV on America...? O_o
its not a swear in the us
in england however...
Lawl.
lol
also wank off is a term for a person
Twat isnt a swear in north america as well
really
Twat is rather strong
Well twat isn't really a swear here either.
x3
in yorkshire its pracitcally cunt
x3
their pretty light on the censorship here...
07,1lol
XD
06,15Oh wow...
06,15Breaking up yet another marriage :P
x3
wilson is now house
but 100x more nice
I'd say twat isn't as strong as git.
But pretty similar.
nah git is weaker than twat

LOL. He brought in his makeshift team.
06,15Dat zoom, House just figured it out.
"He can get anything he wants..."

Who's this 'SuperBrony' fella? Remember, it's 1864.
...touche
unicorn, pegasi or earth
OHGODSHE'SONFIRE
IT IS FOR ME.
You should be earth.
There can be only one.
I'm Unicorn.
HEY!
/me runs for it.
Why'd you do that?
I was just getting comfortable. :(
I"M SORRY, EVERYPONY ;_;
You need to roll a 15 or higher in order to be reborn.
/me rolls a 14

to be ponies
and rename it
MAD MAD (pony name)
In fact, we just had a nice, close strike.
Speaking of MAD
http://youtu.be/_YYclpE16-c
I saw that on TV.
It bothers me that they named the pony in that clip Applejack
But that specific pony is awesome.
Also, I like this song: http://youtu.be/bMgByEotGpM
my mind would explode
It's also the full song.
haircut was a sucess
i took the buzz cutters
and took down the sides and back
then i shaved
Interesting…go on.
then i cleaned up
now i am here
Puppets that like thinking CREATIVELY
...no
nooo
NOOOOOOOO
/me dislikes creative things.
.....
/me dances on ThePretender's head

/me is watching My Little Wu-Tang Clan.
Still listening to pinkiequest.
11th loop
it's a good song
/me starts to /explode/
but can you explode twice?
/me starts expanding.
And was strict about his line in the very same way.
XD
/me explodes once....
/me explodes twice!
mmmm, Jambalaya
...huh, guess you could explode twice
You probably wouldn't want to, though.
Xerion: You can't do that…you're not Fluttershy
/me shrugs
Does that even work? I haven't played with Focus Sash much.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVS3eI0s2aA <-- FLUTTERQUEST

/me swallows a custer bomb
I am GOING TO XPLODE TWICE!
I'm up to Tooting my way through a 13th pinkiequest

VG music is awesome
