Because he is part pony
08,01is it the effect of growing up in a place with an unusually high magical field?
Or my other favourite answer, magic :3
magnets also serve as an excellent answer.
brb
i gotta go.. hopefully i wont rage >.>
Saturn: he's enchanted aka magic
Try not to flip too many tables
08,01maybe his mouth is lined with boric acid
Hey everypony!

Chainsaw crossbow, best idea ever.
this is the one thing missing in gaming
08,01Dark_Horst: that's a bit gory for posting in here
I dont think modern materials for bow string would allow that.
08,01but i'll let you off this *one* time because it was hilarious
whats with the links? its illegal on this site, right?
aw, thank you saturn^^
Saturn, I don't know, I saw things more gory streamed at times :D
08,01i suppose i *did* stream an episode of Elfen Lied
08,01but there were warning attached to both of those
^ yeah warnings
^true
Sketch_Toku i think bruce cambell would be a good zenigatta
twilight is a retard
08,01Punkie_Pue: they're looking into it, i believe
13Saturn: you did start elfen lied?
08,01Shizuka: aye
Hi
cool
now gtfo
13oh look
hes back?

08,01don't go off on one about it
08,01well, pretend he was, then

i never read the comments anyway
08,01Dark_Horst: look up and listen to the song Ebaumsworld.com by Trapezoid (Lemon Demon)
browniestaet stahp
08,01Dark_Horst: they basically steal content to make ad revenue
08,01that's kinda shitty
08,01and, of course, because they're re-encoding, it's shitter quality too
4chan and reddit both produce deent amounts of OC
*decent
stolen content or not, it's easy to browse and appearantly collects form multiple sources into one adress
easy access
13oh fmle...
and the content is fun anyway
08,01alexxm|foal: funnyjunk can suck mine

Pretty much
Even worse, I missed the Asahina episode :'(
i'll be honest, this Haruhi girl makes me angry
DUTCH ANGLE
why does she remind me of selena gomez
XD
This anime would never have worked if it wasn't for Kyon.
Haruhi greatly improves her personality in later installments.
shouldnt her haircut be different every day?
She cut her hair off because plot.
13she *did* change her hair every day
13but then she met kyon
o_O
hi everypony :)
DAMN, Mikuru is tiny
dat suzumiya haruhi no juutsu :3

the answer is always ponies
The only thing childish about her is her face and height.
She's got massive knockers, though.

Yep. This anime.
It's a thing.
i should have watched this show earlier ^_^
Dat Haruhi face.
Mc Donalds!
This is one of the best anime series EVER.
13WAAAT
wat
I've had that happen
Kyon = Mai Hero
13aha now i know why haruhi is triggering a weird familiarity
what's going on in here?
13same VA did KOKOROKOKOROKOKOROKOKORO right
Aya Hirano?
Yes, Haruhi-chan Suzumiya!!
Beware of the moe blob. She skips and cries...
Beware of the moe blob. She's a manipulative bitch.
yeah i keep forgettin that :I
sowwy
called it
Hearing that book ttitle makes me want to read "To Kill a Mocking Bird"
esper?
13psychic
ESPer
13^
Dang it, why didn't I see that? ESPer -_(\
"Koizumi, is there something you wanna tell me?" "Yes, it's as you've guessed... I'm gay." "Actually I'm talking about how you're an esper." "Oh yeah, that too."
Hello Everypony :)
ESPer is a very old sci-fi term. It fell out of use nearly everywhere except in Japan.
13so... haruhi is inception
13BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRM
Esper has actually come back into use thanks to Haruhi Suzumiya.
Haruhi is the differentiated ideoblast. (And you get bonus points is you get that reference).
this show keeps getting more twists than a bread bag tie
^
Just you wait
Wait until the next episode.

Home Alone 2 is DEFFINETLY an A Movie.
hi guys
never saw 3, didn't even know there was a 4
I hate it when people say home alone 2 sucks. its probably make favorite of the home alone movies
hello everyone

i dont even remember 3
i remember 4 cause it had a different kid

13like i said we're still debating
oh and yea they are making a home alone 5, proof here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2308733/
13though i'd recommend voting home alone 1 first cause i hate coming in at the sequel to a film
13and never seen any of them
We should watch Home Alone 1 :3
13did grinch last year

13so enlighten me ponies
13wtf is home alone
not the answer i was expecting
DISREGARD ALL I SAID
13uh huh..
Regard ALL you said!
Home Alone...there's a movie I havent heard of in years....can't remember much about it other than a kid is left home while family is on vacation and he defends his home from burglars
*sings* The sun goes down the stares come out
to think i'm playing Home Alone's song in band, "Somewhere in My Memory"
nice haha
Saturn: That OC looks rather, feminine. Saturn OC's marefriend?
didnt they make more of them? 4 or 5 Home Alones?
Home Alone 4 is the lastest one i think
and that's years old
it is
its like 8 years old
those 3 fanfics do not count
In a shocking twist, McCulley Kulcen is now the role of the burglar
wait
wut
Cant wait for Trixie

3 Is fine, I liked it well enough.

Hello!
:)
And The Holiday Heist, which is Home Alone 5.
Oh the spam time
Inb4 Home Alone 6 is released another ten years later
I need to catch up with Detective Conan
On episode 650
lol
I can't imagine a home alone 6
Wait just looked at my Anime list, I am on 663
13can't stand those... FMA was pushing it
13they want to pretend they have a story arc, but it never ends
Oh thank luna!
Also watching one pieve and reading Naruto and Bleach
One piece*
13never saw it
Those are the worst
i remember when naruto had 2 filler seasons.....
Fillers were the exact reason I quit watching Naruto
really
i dont watch it anymore, but my cousins keep me posted
Is that Miku I hear?
did they had to do that?
2 fucking filler seasons
13for some reason this reminds me
13of all things
13encarta mindmaze
Awww
minus the fillers naruto is pretty good, but the problem is they shove fillers in the form of flashbacks even in the non-filler eps
Hey Everypony
Skyrim
whats goin on
13ATTENTION KAKAROT, MY HAIR IS OUTRAGEOUS
Bleach fillers are not as bad as Naruto Fillers
exactly
^_^ I still have Encart 97 disc
13i tried putting encarta 99 on my VM
i think i left naruto where he dreams with minato and minato telss him he is his father
13too old now
Yea I am reading the manga of that
Got tiredof the Anime
13encarta 99 was the best too cause it had all those animations
Fairy tail is a good anime
Fairy tail is pretty good
Dis song from SKYRIM! :D
13took you long enough to detect skyrim
The one that gave me goosebumps for weeks...
13mm.. that far behind huh..
pfft How could i possibly not recognize skyrim?
and i wanna watch my little monster
Its getting very good >.<
fuck naruto looks like if its never going to end
how long has it been?
9 years? 8?
500 eps
VenHur*
That happends to me all the time
Jokes fly over my head

no, if Saturn was drunk, he'd be hitting on...well...all of us, no?
08,01Sylandest: i hit on you all anyway
Saturn: That you do. You even got me to marry you.
I think if Saturn was drunk he'd be hitting every object around him.
08,01Kurra: actually, when i'm drunk, i get really good at telling stories
08,01and i tend to tella lot of them
08,01well, depending on how drunk i am
And this would be good for knowing history.
08,01there's a point from which i start becoming a lot worse at telling stories
With wine! Or maybe sake even.
08,01and other things like jokes and speaking
wouldnt mind hearing a story from a drunk Saturn

i was just standing in the backyard with nothing on my feet
And the chickens were out, roaming
I look down at my foot to see a little spider a few inches away from my foot
It looked venemous
And right as it was about to climb up my foot, one of our chickens kills it then eats it
And people say chickens are stupid
It was a spider.
