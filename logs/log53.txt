06and it's http://reshzek200.deviantart.com/
7o.O
6she called herself a bronie...
6lol
6that aside
7She's not good with genders, apparently.
06Fluff.
06And lol
06xDS
06didn't she kind of prove that with me and others?
7Ayup.
06yes, she tough i was a girl...and maybe still odes
/me flees
06xD
7Hmm.
6I actually make a point of forgetting about her, ignoring her entirely
13^
6...until someone here brings it up and then I have to do it all over again
7Sorry.
6its ok lol
06yeah
06~
7It was just a filler in a lapse of conversation.

6meh
6I'm just gonna watch it for the dragons, as usual
6the story actually looks somewhat decent, I just can't get over the "parallel universe" thing
13Oh yeah
02._____________________________________________________________________________.
13Probably because she has a good shot type which automatically aims at the nearest enemies
02o-o
6wait
6reimu's shot goes towards enemies as well
6do you not use homing amulet?
6true
6otherwise I'd use her all the time
02^
13Get into the habit of deathbombing just before the bullet actually hits you :P
6that would be difficult but yeah
6I should
6I'm used to bombing right as i get hit, for the sake of sometimes actually avoiding the bullet by some miracle
13I managed to get into that habit after playing MoF and SA, which literally give you no time at all to deathbomb xD
6I just don't play it for some reason lol
13SA is incredibly difficult for me LOL
6probably cuz I 1ccd it on easy but I want to 1cc everything else first
6it was ridiculously easy on easy mode
6I went into utsuho on my 3rd try with 7 lives
6and beat her
6normal...I've only played normal all of 2 times
6reimu + suika = awesome
13^
6yukari can be fun to have as a partner too
6but I accidentally bordered to the other side a few too many times
6and died because of it
13I've done that LOL
6you need all those points for all those lives
13well, I do know now that I'm capable of getting to Orin in normal mode now
13after countless attempts =w=
6I should play that one again
6just
6i never ever ever play it
13Which reminds me, I still need to beat the extra stage
6I never play fullscreen unless it's CtC because that's the default lol
6true
6but I'm used to doing that in windowed :D
/me 6runs
13the good thing about windowed is that you can see more bullets at once
6that terifies me
6I should try again
6...oh time to go
6breakfast :D
13Enjoy :P

03I just got a female Aerodactyl in the dream world
03that is VERY rare
03:)
6I still haven't gone to DW
6and know nothing about i
6it
13Congrats
13:D
03basically
03it's the only way to get non stupid Pok√©mon in BW games
03as there are NO 5th gens in Dream World :D
04GOOD for you :D
03and then it works similarly to earlier games, rare ones are rare etc
03but females are rarer than males
03however, you want females
03because you can breed their natures
03which are DW exclusive
04drf
6their natures are DW exclusive or their abilities?
04I'm sure EVERYONE here knows this already
04:P
03um
6chimera
04Their abilities I think
03abilities, rather
6I just said
6I don't know anything about DW
03why do I keep saying nature LOL
03yeah, abilities.
03as in, when breeding, males give away moves and females give away abilities
03so I basically only look for females
03with the exception of like Tauros and Nidoran Male :P
03Chimera
6and you really need however many thousand points to do this?
03no?>
03just the more points you get, the more POk√©mon show up
6oh
03at first there's maybe 10
03then there's 20
03etc
03yeah you can get Pok√©mon on day 1
03most of those sites
03:P
03wow
03Aerodactyl's BW animation
03makes it look like it's having a seizure
04[14:53:18] <%drfsupercenter> 03Chimera
04[14:53:21] <%drfsupercenter> 03no?>
04Hm?
03no
04IIRC most sites like Serebii and Bu-
04oh
04and they did drf? :P

/me shot
03then that's kinda defeating the purpose
03of liking rain
13I mainly like listening to/watching it xD
13But being caught in the rain is pretty awesome too, providing the temperature isn't too cold
6hot rain isn't exactly fun either though
6yay contacts

6after a few seconds, I quickly realized I was wrong, managed to look at the title
6and went ooooh

I wanted to ask
amateur radio?
Ew iPod :<
Yes
its one of the very few portable FM tuners with RDS support
most are in cars
my amateur radio call is KD7YUF
Thanks, aha
although the Insignia portable HD Radio supports RDS
Mine was going to be VE1 KAD if I ever got my license
although given my location it would be KD7YUF/9
due to being in the 9th amateur radio call district
Aaah
Indiana is in the 9th district

02Oh crap
02Kitten is awake
03gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood stupid out of print CDs
03I am not paying $200 for one CD but :/
03it may be the only way
03Transformers: The Score
03from the 2007 movie
03apparently they were dumb and didn't make anywhere near enough
why on earth would that be out of print
oh
03but go look it up
03all you can get is the mp3s
03I want the actual disc for collection value
03as it's like one of the best movie scores ever
forgot to look for that one too lol
add it to my collection of movie soundtracks
/me searches for one
03mp3s?

wait
nvm
03yeah
03it's like saying why do you want a plush when you can just take a picture of one
yeah
well
03I think the concept of paying for data is stupid, if I'm going to buy something I want to be able to hold it in my hands, you know?

03and the actual cover is insanely pixelated
03http://cgi.ebay.com/TRANSFORMERS-EXP-Steve-Jablonsky-89-MIN-SCORE-NEW-EDT-/140579207135?pt=Music_CDs&hash=item20bb2c77df

03if you look at where the 3 people are
12stupid looking you say

10Bah, TST forum went down (and yes, I realize it was supposed to)
03lasers
03etc
6I wish lol
03shoudln't be that hard to do if you get a laser pointer
03and just cut a hole in the fabric
03XD
6my plushes are 100% huggable, nothing solid or potentially harmful inside
:p
ok, good :P

13This song was on the radio earlier and now it's stuck in my head http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KELSQEnoD8
rawrawrawrawrawr
hi
there, slightly less quiet
hello!
hooray
I just thought I'd say things to liven the place up
I try and encourage conversation from time to time, but no one ever seems to be around
Sad times
yes, where hath they all gone?
I didn't kill any of them with a rake, promise!
hey
7whoops
I am
:O
Can I put you in my acquaintances circle?
yes you may
I like putting people in circles
:o
I did it!
Hopefully I got the right person
We're going out for a bit now, see you all another time
bye RN =D
yup, nice hat
Probably not
you can set the priority of the program if I recall though
setting affinity won't stop it using the other cores if it needs to use them if I remember correctly
12ohnoes
12Skull Kid ripped me off D:
ok
actually, ignore me
I just clicked the affinity dialogue
and it's which cores is the program allowed to use
hmm
the Source engine is designed to be able to make use of multiple cores
I see
I'm glad I don't have a machine like that
lol
13I swear my memory is fading
13since TST's in maintenance mode, I went to deviantart instead
06oo
6lol
currently it's just pretty damn awesome
13I've actually done that several times now within the past 10 minutes .w.
really?
specs?
13It's just my first instinct to open a TST tab if I don't already have one open D:
3.4Ghz Phenom II X4 cpu
Nvidia GTX460 gpu
8GB Corsair XMS3 DDR3 ram
XD
a corsair 650W PSU that I can't remember the name of
a DVB TV Tuner card that I forget the make of
rofl
on a Gigabyte full-ATX motherboard that again, I can't remember the model of :P
in an Antec 300 case with extra front fans installed by me
Mine too @angel :(
with two 24" widescreen monitors
I only have 1 23" monitor, but I plan on getting a second
I'm planning to get either a watercooling system for my CPU, or an SSD next
6well
6ok
6 30
6but
6I haven't bothered to think it through much
6I'm just cutting fabric here hoping for the best
6but I just realized

6enough for the turret
6but the espeon....not enough

/me 12hides
12and Glacy
/me !$nick
Maybe on the surface I'm not. lol
12because
12darn .-.
12fishing poles are fragile
02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D

Now I want an Oreo milkshake.
12D:
12oh?
12milkshake
/me 12wants
12xD
03*it
/me hides
12...
12i hate this XD
>_>
03are you being a jerk to anyone there?
and he keeps trying to annoy my gf, which i find very irritating
Tell him to suck it. That never fails.
12Ah
muahahahaha.
no. you dont.
Do I? lol
as many games*
;p blah stupid typos
12no
;o
>_>
12i want to catch this fish
<3
Leashes
/me runs
12XD
The biggest fish is under the log near the front entrance.
I meant if you were actually in it. My bad. lol
12o.o
12the log is near the back I thought
12brb
Well, there's a log somewhere. xD
12there is multiple logs
I need a picture, lol.
http://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda05/Fishing/FishingPond_BigFish1.gif
There ya go. That's exactly where, lol.
12back
Brbs
12thats nearer to the beck :P
12*back
12tys
12i've been at this for hours but the biggest i've caught was like 8 inches
I'm going by memory, haha.
12as was I ;3
12Glacy
Yeah, but you're memory doesn't suck like mine. p:
12you have to wiggle and jerk it
Therefore I win.
12that'll catch their attention
nvm...
z.z
12and out of context...yah
12that was a gutter-mind's paradise of a phrase
That's why it's best to get as near as you can to the fish, but not close enough to scare them.
It gives you more wiggle room.
12but
12Glacy
12make sure
12you do NOT
12catch the Loach first XD
12granted
12the odds of THAT are slim at best
12i'll try
12if it says 35 pounds
12throw it back
12I kid you not
12the adult Link Loach nullifies any prize you haven't gotten yet
12great after like 15 tries of getting the fish to take the bai
12t
12it lets go after like 2 seconds
12XD
this screen has too much blue on it
06~
I couldn't tell. lol
12XD
Now I feel like playing OoT. Last time I touched it was...
6 years ago. Damn.
12XD
/me 12also has that effect on people :3
12!Glacymr
I never understood the point of these scripts. lol
12:3
12i give up
12-.-
12lol
12this is why i don't try getting 100% of the upgrades in LoZ it's usually 50 times harder than the story itself
12bbl
12kk
12kay
12low battery power i know
12XD
12and sound
12also .-.
12I glitched it earlier
12made a block go into another one
12the graphics went spazzy
12ohhhh EVILNESS
too much blue
12making me go in as an adult, only to do 2 trhings and force me to go back as a child for about 20sec only to make me become an adult AGAIN to finish it D:
/me 12disagrees
12it's only child, then adult
12none of MQ's repeating
12the theme bugs me
Lol, I loved that level. xD
12tho the boss is <3
Different tastes.
12Bongo Bongo is
12WTF
12but
12GIANT DRUM ARENA
12is <3
/me 12shudders
12the whole spine thing scarred me .-.
The sad part is the fact you can kill him in less than two minutes.
12try under 30sec :P
I would if you were able to replay bosses like in Majora's Mask. ):
12Phantom Ganon, Barinade, Volvagia, and Twinrova can't be beaten under 1min

129001 years
12umm
03why does it matter
03"a long time"
12since b4 the 3DS's release
12More then likely since the release of OoT DS, since it takes that long to make a remake like that
12like
12NightSeas
12it's like a remake of 2 games +
12so we're talking a couple yearsd

03I haven't seen a single review that said they like the way standard DS games look on the 3DS
03...
03implying that actually makes a differen*ce
03the 3D light turns off meaning there IS no 3D

hey everyone
Nice
that might say something
I did the same thing too
although I got two movies in one cd
ugh
it was in a sale pile
because it did not sell
I got the Voice of the forest and Heros together
most US viewers tend to focus on the past or only know about it
I do both
the past and the future
I hate the present and future
only focusing on the past
I'm equal
I like all
and other anime
Dawn I found annoying and boring
how?
May I found to be just plain annoying
bland personality
O.o
Thats whats fun about him
not realy
its repetitive
Ash learns something then forgets it quickly
you can critizise it
thats why its fun
thats why its repetitive
and annoying
without that there wouldn't be any good rps and fanfictions
not really
I read tons without Ash being dumb
but the ones I do read are hilarious
the way the author wrote it
Brock I got annoyed with too
his "gag" got old fast
as did Ash being a moron
yes
