7Hmm.
7How does that TF2 game about 7/23/11 from 4:00 - 7:00 AM GMT sound?
03:3
/me 7pokes the two of them.
06aohai AE :3

hi AE
7>>
7<<
7AE?
12Right now I’m calculating what time that is MST xD
7Could you draw my character sometime? XD
7MST or MDT?
7http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6974.msg272965#msg272965
12MST
7You're not observing DST?
13Do you have a reference I can use?
7Huh.
7Well, chop off one hour from the time linked above.
12k
13Well, I'm quite unreliable when it comes to requests, but I'll see what I can do :3
7That's all right. :P
7Your work is so cute. o3o
How many times have you said that
7I just have to state again. XD
7Brb.
12It's 2:55pm GMT right now?
133:57pm
12k
12xD
yeah
:p
4hrs ahead of here
12Ah, 9:00PM-11:00PM. Okay, I'll see if I can be there
12Anyways, bbl
/me is playing TH8 now :3
wut
12lightheart is a taco pokemon
*ahem* AE, SC
/me shot
13gah, I was doing well at remembering too =w=
XD
13...and that is a perfect example of why I'm unreliable |D
13sometimes I even tell people I'm gonna draw something and then I don't
13it's awful, I know ;;
13It all depends on how I'm feeling and whether I'm motivated or not
mhmm
13According to my mum we were supposed to start tidying the house and such today
13but she's been playing Farmville all day >>;
hmm...well this time, i have an idea somewhat of what you COULD draw AE
12yes
?
12that would make a perfect drawing :)
no
/me now belongs to lightheart for 13 minutes and has to fly lightheart around until then
*points to my msn pic* ;) maybe something with the 2 people in that pic ;3
06thats what you get for calling a cat a taco!
13I'll be honest, if I ever feel like drawing that, then I will |D
13that's basically how it goes for every "request" I get
yeah
13so it's more like I'm given an idea, and I may draw it depending on when I feel like it :B
13Trust me, my pictures end up looking crappy and awful when I don't have the motivation to do it ;; I suffered two years of Art GCSE to learn that
but your drawings are good
13You've never seen the bad ones
13xD
13Basically, if I don't like the quality of the picture, it doesn't get put on the internet |D
13and it most likely gets deleted too LOL
XD

7o.O
6she called herself a bronie...
6lol
6that aside
7Yes, indeed.
7She's not good with genders, apparently.
06Fluff.
06And lol
7Well, scratch out the 'apparently'.
06xDS
06didn't she kind of prove that with me and others?
7Ayup.
06yes, she tough i was a girl...and maybe still odes
/me flees
its lonely in here :(
13Her very existence on the internet annoys me =w=
06xD
7Hmm.
6I actually make a point of forgetting about her, ignoring her entirely
13^
6...until someone here brings it up and then I have to do it all over again
7Sorry.
6its ok lol
06As long as no one approaches her in any way nothing will happen soo
06yeah
06~
7It was just a filler in a lapse of conversation.
7I see Feather is awake.
06I certainly do not see how people mistake me for a girl though o3o
7Lol.
well... Onward to the rest of the internet I guess.

/me yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawns loudly
6as for the new pokemon movie
6meh
6I'm just gonna watch it for the dragons, as usual
6the story actually looks somewhat decent, I just can't get over the "parallel universe" thing
6oh god that actually /was/ a good movie
13ohai Ray :3
13Oh yeah
02*yanws* Hiya Angel ^^
02._____________________________________________________________________________.
13Probably because she has a good shot type which automatically aims at the nearest enemies
13and she gets one more bomb than the other characters
13Even Youmu didn't give me half as much trouble as she usually does since my shot-type was powerful enough to dispel her spellcards faster o-o
02o-o
6wait
6reimu's shot goes towards enemies as well
6do you not use homing amulet?
6true
6otherwise I'd use her all the time
02^
13Get into the habit of deathbombing just before the bullet actually hits you :P
6that would be difficult but yeah
6I should
6I'm used to bombing right as i get hit, for the sake of sometimes actually avoiding the bullet by some miracle
13I managed to get into that habit after playing MoF and SA, which literally give you no time at all to deathbomb xD
6thats why MoF is so hard for me
6SA...isn't so hard
6I just don't play it for some reason lol
13SA is incredibly difficult for me LOL
6probably cuz I 1ccd it on easy but I want to 1cc everything else first
13MoF is a lot easier once you adapt to using your bombs more efficiently
6it was ridiculously easy on easy mode
6I went into utsuho on my 3rd try with 7 lives
6and beat her
6normal...I've only played normal all of 2 times
13It took me a while to get used to playing SA because I wasn't used to the different shot options you get in that game D:
6reimu + suika = awesome
13^
6yukari can be fun to have as a partner too
6but I accidentally bordered to the other side a few too many times
6and died because of it
6besides, that game is SO focused on getting items
13I've done that LOL
6you need all those points for all those lives
13well, I do know now that I'm capable of getting to Orin in normal mode now
13after countless attempts =w=
6I should play that one again
6I want to play MoF too, since I adore the characters in that game, and the music, and everything
6just
6i never ever ever play it
13Lack of fullscreen option in MoF is what used to put me off |D Took me a while to get used to playing it windowed
13Which reminds me, I still need to beat the extra stage
6I never play fullscreen unless it's CtC because that's the default lol
13I always play fullscreen, it helps me fit through small gaps between bullets easier :B
6true
6but I'm used to doing that in windowed :D
/me 6runs
13the good thing about windowed is that you can see more bullets at once
13Oh, also, did you ever get around to attempting EoSD's extra mode again? Since you worked so hard to unlock that xD
6OH GOD LOL
6that terifies me
6I should try again
6cuz yeah, I spent so long getting there
6...oh time to go

/me now belongs to Aurora for 16 minutes
6we're good
04hi Aurora :3
06:3
03I just got a female Aerodactyl in the dream world
03that is VERY rare
03:)
6I still haven't gone to DW
6and know nothing about i
6it
13Congrats
13:D
03basically
03it's the only way to get non stupid Pokémon in BW games
03well, save for the 10 or so you can get in White Forest/Black City
6stupid according to your definition
03as there are NO 5th gens in Dream World :D
04GOOD for you :D
03and then it works similarly to earlier games, rare ones are rare etc
03but females are rarer than males
03however, you want females
03because you can breed their natures
03which are DW exclusive
04drf
6their natures are DW exclusive or their abilities?
04I'm sure EVERYONE here knows this already
04:P
03um
04Their abilities I think
03abilities, rather
6I just said
6I don't know anything about DW
03why do I keep saying nature LOL
6 11:50	Aurora	and know nothing about i
03yeah, abilities.
04k :B
04lo siento :c
03You can get exclusive moves as well, but most of those moves can also be taught by breeding or TMs, so it's not as vital
04well every info site says this already so yeh
03as in, when breeding, males give away moves and females give away abilities
03so I basically only look for females
03with the exception of like Tauros and Nidoran Male :P
6and you really need however many thousand points to do this?
03no?>
03just the more points you get, the more POkémon show up
6oh
03at first there's maybe 10
03then there's 20
03etc
03yeah you can get Pokémon on day 1
03most of those sites
03got their info from bluesun
03:P
03and we're trying to find a programmer so we can make bluesun's DW cheat program
03that just goes and gets all the Pokémon for you so you don't have to play the stupid minigames XD
03wow
03Aerodactyl's BW animation
03makes it look like it's having a seizure
04Hm?
03no
03that no was at Aurora
04IIRC most sites like Serebii and Bu-
04oh
03I meant to say that most of those sites got their info from bluesun :P
04and they did drf? :P
03as he pieced together a lot of the data
03and gave them to someone
04k
03yeah

13I love when it rains so hard the gutter on the roof overflows |D
you love rain? o_O
meh, i HATE storms
13When I'm not caught in it, sure :3
lol i always thought you would like jumping in the rain
/me shot
03then that's kinda defeating the purpose
03of liking rain
13I mainly like listening to/watching it xD
13But being caught in the rain is pretty awesome too, providing the temperature isn't too cold
6hot rain isn't exactly fun either though
03I hate precipitation in general
03snow just gets annoying as it makes a mess, rain sucks because if you wear glasses being in the rain makes you not able to see...
6yay contacts
lol
People don't like snow?
O_o

6no post on sundays ;-;
6otherwise yes I would have it today
03floof by mail?
6it's in the state, and should be fairly close to me
6it'll arrive tomorrow unless they decide to do the stupid extra day of sorting
6and then it'll be tuesday
06xD
6seriously
6so when things get shipped, I have two main UPS centers around me
6one 1 hour north of me, one 30 minutes south
6and half the time, the package arrives at the center at like 7 in the morning, long before they ship things out
6and it's STILL THERE at 10pm
6so it gets sent to me the next day
6what's worse is when it's shipped the next day, comes to my town's post office, and remains there YET ANOTHER DAY
06>-<
6I saw this once when i tracked my package, saw all the stops it took
6saw it listed in the post office at my town
6but it was after the office closed
6I was like NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
6I must now respect just how big espeons arre

Laters
13How was the meet? :3
06Oh yes, indeed! =o How was it?
twas fun!
extremely tiring too
oh and the whole metrco centre got flooded today xD
06o.o
13Literally flooded with water or flooded with people? LOL |D
it was pouring with rain but it all just dribbled through and pound land got flooded
both
13LOL awesome xD
13Well, not awesome for them
13but still |D
06x3
also yo sushi had all you can eat offer on today <3
I have a funny photo of Xai looking like he's actually in pain playing it
then we went to a pool hall and played pool and had drinks
/me has never tried sushi before
you'd maybe be surprised
I'd reccomend the california hand roll
13The smell puts me off a bit, but I'd still like to try it o3o
13I'll try almost anything at least once xD
13!espeon
/me didn't know sushi smelled :S
/me already belongs to you, silly :3
06I don't like Sushi at all pretty much |D
06and play the ET game, why are you torturing them so?
LOL
13well, I can always smell sushi when I walk past a sushi bar in a shopping centre, so o-o
Lugia for some odd reason played it the longest o.o thought it can actually be completed
and espy its actually fun to play with a group of people cos then you can laugh together at how bad it is
I've never had sushi
/me feeds Pattyrick a california hand roll
06I can certainly agree with that Nick, things that are so bad that you can't stop trying it (like you can't move your eyes from a trainwreck) become exponentially more fun the more people there are |D
it was just watching Xai trying to get out one of the holes was just amazingly hilarious
/me needs a little wasabi and a large glass of milk

13with a sp attack stat of 37
4@Skylands did you mean, it's italic on the chaty chat box? then yes
1310 points higher than its speed stat, which is its second highest
7You could keep it... X3
4i wanted to know how you typed it like that
Hi
13But I want SPEED
10Well
13;-;
7Well, keep resetting.
7Or abuse the RNG.
10I did / <insert word here> /
7But that'd probably take longer than just resetting. XD
4oh
10Without spaces between the slashes
7It's a Mibbit thing.
/me comes out of dark alley with a long trenchcoat on "ya want speed? I got tha stuff for the right price!"

hi thar Skylands
13...I give up
13D:
hi LL :D
DCD is apparently going to be around a lot more since hes on vacation
he can probably help
tomorrow or something
Who normally runs stream?
Isn't it Sprinkles?
13DCD
6DCD
13SPrinkles is a backup streamer
6I'm backup
13We'll see what DCD has on the matter
K
13if not then I just downloaded a bunch of shit that will be deleted
13xD
i know that feel
my internet absolutely flies, but my video card couldnt handle the stream
13and I'll ask Dari if he totally would take like a week to script that. Which would be terrible, actually.
script what?
What is your video card?
Nevermind.
13I recall being on a streaming site that gave different tabs for streams or something, and if he could somehow embed my livestream on here too. But Honestly, that coding would be a dickkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
For this site?
13mmhm.
13Procaster and Livestream.com work perfectly for me.
You're site's probably CSS and/or HTML.
I know some people that know CSS.
6It's CSS/HTML
I know some people that know that.
off to sleep
night all
6I used to know CSS, but it's been FOREVER.
13goodnight Nick :3
6I still know HTML like the back of my hand though.
night angel
I know mainly C, though I knew more C back in college than now because I didn't use it for a while.
12ohai Angel
If I re-learn strings, I could build a better random list organizer for this site.
Or use Perl.
12Angel floof cake :D
6We don't really need a random list organizer though.
Random.org is just a fancy random number generator and probably python.
I know.
But it would make for a fun project.
6A fun and pointless one...
What better way to learn strings and random number seeding.
(and pointers if you want to use those instead of array indices).
6I can think of many better ways, personally...
I want to relearn pointers in C. Those are easy, and I used to be able to use them like a boss.
Yeah.
6Oh... btw.

This site has changed so much in the past few years o.o
7I don't suppose you're into IV breeding, AE? :P
You prolly did see me around.
7You're still resetting for that Espeon?
I used to be on here all the freaking time.
13Yep, I'm still working on it |D
10You're the one with Tales Of Vesperia avatar?
13And I've never tried IV breeding before
Yup.
13The furthest I ever go is nature and characteristic
10I found your profile with ease
10And, Repede~
I bet xD
13then a quick check on an IV calculator
Repede for the win.
13but they're not very accurate when the Pokemon is lv 1
13|D
But. Off topic! xD
7Go to Battle Institute.
04o-o
04Ohai
10Off topic is welcomed in here
Yah. I know.
13I do spend a lot of game time breeding though, so I could always try it out sometime :P

12Dunno, she's odd like that
/me runs
It's a RP site. ... With some people who need to put soap in their muzzles.
13Anyway Quan, since you brought it up I'm assuming you had a Pokemon in mind that you wanted to be IV bred? o3o
7Yes to an extent.
10So I was right :P
13Because I could try, if you want xD It'll give me something to do
7I'm looking for proper IVs, HP, and Ability. XD
7HP as in Hidden Power.
12I’ve actually never been on F-List. But according to what I’ve heard, I don’t want to
04The Pokemon's Hidden Power is determined by IVs isn't it?
Pff. Not everything is super horrible bad.
7Yep.
7But my desired HP can't have perfect IVs. D:
12No, but people have preferences

I don't play the game as much anymore.
he's the one who introduced me to FLYING UNDER FINAL DESTINATION
WB Sky~'
:3
I'm a lot better now
than I was then
13then again I haven't played the game in forever
10Thanks

6Random little question..Have any of you heard Gunslinger by Avenged Sevenfold?
Ness?
I'd love to brawl you angel, sometime soon hopefully
12he was the next runner up afterall
yeah manly
i'm going to be moving to LA
so that means no wii for a year LOL
Wow O.o
Get a Wii U/
12XD
12i don't see the point
12it's not like anyone cares anymore
what I remember was I tried and tried and tried to brawl him
12i'm sure if i held the tournament again
but our schedules didn't meet up
12i'd get a completely different group of people
so once the deadline hit
we stopped trying
12i shouldn't have even set a deadline
Brawls with Kirby o- o
Yeah, cause I do remember always trying to play.
13:D
12because it was the most important match of the tournament
/me also is a Kirby player
13Kirby and Pikachu
13|D

03WHY WOULD YOU WANT THAT
03Skype Mobile is so much more useful

And Facebook should sue apple for Facetime

also on this cheap transmitter no ultrasonic filtering FTW!
03I just thought that was funny
I might upload it later.
it will pass 57 KHz
:P
which means RDS works
aka Radio Data System
Awww... I thought this usb would glow bright red...
its pretty cool to have on FM
03http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pokmon-cant-even-handle-my-swag.jpg
this makes it possible to display song and artist info along with other things on RDS enabled FM receivers
I wanted to ask
What's your call sign?
example being for portables the Sangean ATS-909, Microsoft Zune, and Apple iPod Nano
for what
amateur radio?
Ew iPod :<
Yes
its one of the very few portable FM tuners with RDS support
most are in cars
my amateur radio call is KD7YUF
Thanks, aha
although the Insignia portable HD Radio supports RDS
03OH MY GOD EW @ THIS PICTURE
Mine was going to be VE1 KAD if I ever got my license
although given my location it would be KD7YUF/9
due to being in the 9th amateur radio call district
Aaah
Indiana is in the 9th district

Still im watching you, and your not on my good side
Early today... I had the same type of pain in my chest.
And thats only because i dont know your whole story
It does sometimes
I hope it was a heart attack
But dont do it too much, otherwise people will nojt like you
No pun intended

Lololol
03gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood stupid out of print CDs
03I am not paying $200 for one CD but :/
03it may be the only way
what CD?
03Transformers: The Score
03from the 2007 movie
03apparently they were dumb and didn't make anywhere near enough
why on earth would that be out of print
oh
03Good question
03but go look it up
03all you can get is the mp3s
03I want the actual disc for collection value
03as it's like one of the best movie scores ever
03and they also derped up with the 3rd movie
03apparently the CD didn't get Michael Bay's approval until like 2 days before the set release date so they wer elike "Um... yeah, digital only" >_> so therefore a physical version doesn't exist
forgot to look for that one too lol
add it to my collection of movie soundtracks
/me searches for one
03mp3s?
03as I have them
oh lol
can I have?
03yeah
03hm
also, why do you want the actual cd then
wait
nvm
I read what you said
03yeah
03it's like saying why do you want a plush when you can just take a picture of one
yeah
well
03I think the concept of paying for data is stupid, if I'm going to buy something I want to be able to hold it in my hands, you know?
03I really just pirate music I don't care about XD
yeh
03and eh, I don't have my web servper set up yet
03*server
03but I can get you download links
k
03http://www.filesonic.com/file/1358426694/Transformers_-_Dark_of_the_Moon__The_Score__320kbps.rar
03that's the newest one
nah, I really only liked the first lol
03oh
03OK
o-o
who broke the internet
/me shot
03http://www.megaupload.com/?d=X0KWX72J
03that's the first one
03there's also a bootleg version (which I bought on ebay XD) that has like 50 tracks instead of 20
03if you want that too
12lolz
03waaaaait woooooah
03this is a *two disc* one
03my bootleg is only one
03I so want that
03http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/2599/transformersback.jpg
03fricking ton of tracks
12LOL
03the bootleg one
03only shows the people
03not the robots
03as you can see from the back
03it's so silly
wth 50? o.o
03and the actual cover is insanely pixelated
03yeah, that
thats a ton of music there
0350 tracks
03but look at the artwork, it's so stupid looking LOL:
12sit
yeah lol
03and on the actual disc
03if you look at where the 3 people are
12stupid looking you say
03it's pixelated
03because they basically zoomed in the real album cover which has them in the far distance
12what's the best way to destroy the quality of an image?
03http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gg%2Bz6Xi4L.jpg
03that's the real one, notice how small the people are :P
12back and forward
12so from jpg to what?
03png
12takes 2 to tango
03or something
128D
12oh
03Haha
03the actual website says "bootleg release"
03I love how they list it as that
12hmm
I did
Bow down to me Link
Muahahahaha
03OMG
03I am so buying this
03I don't care that it's a bootleg, i want it
Ate my paper towel with the sammich like yeah
03bought
12drf is all for bootlegs
12volcano bakemeat!
03X
03*XD
03I am when they have more stuff than the real one
0360 something tracks vs 20, isn't it obvious?
12lol
03that being said I still want the real one just because it's the real one
03but yeah
12depends on what the 40 other things are
03XD
03dude
03it's a 2.5 hour movie
03the official sountrack is only an hour
03think about how much is lost
03:P
12yes about 1.5 hours
03exactly
12but is it really important stuff
03it's all good music
12i mean it's just a transformers movie
12granted a ton of my friends would kill me if they knew i said that
03:DS
03-S
12oww
12that hurt a little
03LOL
wow, I figured that wouldn't hurt at all
12:<
03LOL
LOL yeah
why would you do that D:
03k
12it's fun :)
03it's like asking Kyu why he sits on people
03he obviously doesn't know what a chair is
03:P
Shiny~
02I haven't seen you in a while
12shinyyyy
12!shinywalk
Kyu does that because he can't stand for that long
hard
he's old y'know
03only a year or two older than me
12going to rest night
03why did I read that as "going to regret last night"
02Yup
02THanks Umbreon :3
12because you misread everything drf
12your brain works much like autocorrect for the ipod and iphond
/me hides
no, drf
Kyu's like 400 years old
|D
03uh-huh
03silly role players
03still, Yoda was older
No
He's literally that old
|D
03suuuure
I don't rp anymore anyway
03and you're literally a fox
no, I'm not
03well
03that could be taken two ways
03so
I just have a fox hat :D
/me hides
D:
03but nah
:|
03why the D:? That would be a GOOD thing if you weren't creepily young compared to me :P
I think it's annoying when people call girls "foxes"
I don't find it at all flattering tbh
er, Aurora
look at my nick
LOL
03is it any worse than just saying someone's hot?
I think hot is horrible too
03LOL
or that reason D:
03well
03depends on the person I suppose
granted I could have just said that in skype
03some girls don't mind it and consider it a compliment :P
but I can talk to you here too lol
03LOL you guys are voice chatting?
yeah we usually do
no
03it's like when LL and I are talking on xbox live but talk on here too
03I'm always like LOL WHAT
03anyway sigh
03i need to be up in 7 hours
same
er
03and hopefully I won't miss McDonald's breakfast as if I don't eat my hash browns I basically can't stay awake in class
8
03and the bad thing about small community colleges
03is the teachers actually notice
03and yell at me
03;/
lol
my teachers never cared
03well
03mine does
03the class is a complete joke
03I prolly got above 100% on that exam last week since she gave extra credit
03so i feel completely justified sleeping LOL
12kay XD
03but that being said I have been yelled at twice for rit
03:/
03*it
03what I find funny though
03the McDonald's here stops breakfast at 10:30, right
03so I get to the drive through at 10:28
03order some hash browns
03they're like, we have to cook some, give us a few minutes
03I show up at 10:32 and theyu're l;ike gtfo, we're serving lunch
03I'm like ...
lol
03to quote Get Smart
03"Missed it by THAT MUCH"
03but it's happened twice to me
03so I'm hoping tomorrow I can get there ON TIME LOL
03right so
03I need to go to bed
I love that movie omg
03So do I

03I was going to watch the first harry potter today
03I forgot
03since I'm seeing the last one saturday night
03I wanted to watch all 7 this week
03one a day
03but eh
I was about to see the last one again today
03heh
03I'm going to see it in IMAX
I wish we had one around here that was showing it :|
/me jumps up on Roara's head
ok so
the imax in san jose
whenever they go to do a show, they have this opening sequence where they light up the speakers in the back
03OH
so you can see where they are, while the screen also explains what each does
03I just remembered
the whole sequence is like a minute
03I secretly filmed the Henry Ford IMAX
03intro0
03that one's over a minute too
but the music they play during it, it's lovely
03remind me tomorrow
03and I'll upload it
I've been trying to figure out if that music is something specifically for imax, or something I can get ahold of
03take your camera next time?
03well
03your phone
03I managed to stealthily record our IMAX intro when I went to see Pirates XD
02lol

03check that out XD
yeah i know that one
03o.o
I'll have to record the sj one sometime
03that's a custom video
03that's from the henry Ford
03XD
oh I saw the thumbnail of the blue countdown
anyways
03yeah I don't mean that
03I have that one already
OH MY GOD
DEATHLY HALLOWS IS AT THE IMAX
k...
I know what I'm doing lol
03didn't I just say I was seeing it at the imax?
yes but
07lol
our imax doesn't usually show these movies
03oh
03k
03yeah
they didn't show HTTYD when it came out
03the Henry Ford didn't show Transformers 3 :(
07tech museum?
03Or HTTYD
which was like...the one thing I wanted to see there
yeh kyu
03but they showed HP7.1 and 2
03so eh
03and (EW) Twilight x.x
03anyway
03off to bed
but they've got HP7 playing every day through the next couple week
s
gonna go next week
03XD
03well if you want to know about the music
03do me a favor and record it
03using your phonw
03XD
I'll take my phone
03*phone
03yeah
03turns out
07lol
03when I recorded the Henry Ford intro
I hope they do the intro for the actual movie
03the video itself is just completely black
03it's just the audio
03which is still fine
since that's what they use for the normal videos they play there
07we should watch it together XP
I dunno what day I'm going
03the Henry Ford does their custom intro for every movie, unless they're running late (due to long lines etc0
and my mom might be taking me
07ah
03anyway
03night
because 1) she's been pestering me to see it
07lol
2) I don't have to pay
so no complaints
anyways yep
I should sleep
stupidly long day tomorrow

Hi GL =D
How is everybody doin'?
12I'm doing pretty good, you?
I'm good
04o-o
got a lot of sleep last night, so I feel better :3
04I still had that nick?
12Yep
12For hours I think |D
*sigh* I had to deal with 3 idiots today ._.
12IRL or online?
or both?
online
on a diff server
12Because I have to deal with idiots everyday online
/me runs
my gf sent me some logs and this made me po'd
Raxz: today is national weed day -- oops i mean Silvers birthday! <==
btw, its not my birthday at all :p
12You're sure there not just joking?
no. hes an idiot on SC
>_>
I HATE him
12I just don’t take anyone seriously online
My attitude is either deal with it or troll face when someone don’t like me xD
or do what i did and be a complete and total ass to anyone that tried to get in my way over there :p
12However, if what the person is saying is true, then I listen
12Like when NS asks me to stop doing something XD
xD
yeah, hes a 14 year old idiot. im talking about Raxz btw ;p
12lol
and he kept saying i had a pot head, which made no sense
a head made of pot, makes perfect sense
[03:14] <voice> God, why must you idiots always involve her <-- why does silver have a pot leaf head? <--- THIS really po'd me
12Pot head= empty head which = dumb
/me runs
airhead
12Yeah, just like airhead
:P
Cherry Airheads are good, but not the airhead kind of person
12POT HEAD >|
means something else
12It just sounds immature no matter how you say it xD
Dont do drugs kids
and don't drink alcoholic beverages
12Ew alcoholic beverages
Do both at once, its twice the fun
0__o
12Real men use alcoholic beverages to communicate
Grunts and burps
12Yep

oh, more people are here
cool
I'm losing my mind
13ohai drf~
hi :/
13Something wrong? :<
yeah
major depression
13:/ Well I hope things work out for you in the end, whatever it is
thanks :/
read up, btw, if you're curioud
s
13Hm, if it's something along the lines of what I think it is, then I think I can understand how you feel due to my own past experiences :< It's hard to block out feelings and thoughts that you don't want to have
13they're usually just phases that pass over time, but still, they're annoying as hell
what do you think it is? :P
13Erm, something along the lines of being jealous of someone else/you think someone else is getting in the way etc... something like that
13I'm probably wrong though LOL
well
not getting in the way
just someone else I used to have feelings for that's now nin
er
now in a relationship
and I can't seem to stop thinking abou i
t
oh god I can't type x.x
13So, a part of you still isn't over this other person?
yeah
and the jealousy part comes from the fact that they're happier together than LL and I afe :/
*are
13'Kay I know for a fact that this is a LOT easier said than done, but the best you can do is to just not involve yourself with this person at all and focus on your relationship with LL
well when they're more active here than LL... :/
also sigh, quiz, brb
13Well, just keep telling yourself that those two have got nothing to do with you. You shouldn't ever compare yourself with other people, especially when they've supposedly got more of something that you want
13Life's too short to deal with things that aren't worth your time
13Like I said, easier said than done |D But I know for a fact that it's just a phase and you'll get over it in time
12lol
12i know
06As AE says, it is certainly easier said than done - but it is still the best way .-.

we're live
lunch break over, back to class
blah, that song is kinda bland to be honest
9can you see the static?
8yep
Pass the link
I'm using my own client, so I don't have the page open
9http://dinkypage.com/bronystate
9how's the quality, hip?
8hard to read text
8quality is pretty low
9yeah
9give me a second
I grew up with it so I love it XD
Preparing for the Snatcher, or?
12i need a OoT person
9that should do it
9yeah we're just making tests
Alright
9no, it doesn't fix the low quality
9weird
9I think the quality is much better now, ja?
8yeah
I'd text LL for you but she appears to not have her phone with her
8much, much better
12hmm
12i wouldn't ask you to go to that extent for me anyway
when we text all the time it isn't that big of a deal
Will there be someone talking on the mic?
12lol
Or just plain gameplay along with chat?
8regular gameplay
9normally I just play with the gamepad
Ok
9let's test to see if I should use Gamepad Shooting
9or Mouse Lightgun
9a sec
Snatcher ain't that bad with just gamepad
9yeah
9the gamepad actually feels great in this game
9maybe I should ask the audience for their preference
Heh, I played snatcher on an arcade stick
9....dude, that sounds awesome
9Hipster, I think I have learned of a way to make the quality of our streams to be much, much better
9because I think this has good quality right here
02*WB03(Aurora03)02WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it

Hi
9...there was a Sdatcher thread in Ponychan?
9sup Barry
12lol
the days are going by so fast
Nothing much. What about you?
Someone posted about the stream
I wish they would slow down
Or if you mean the game, I've played this and Policenauts
I don't
9not much, testing stuff for tonight's stream
9no no
cool
9I mean SDatcher
9the new Snatcher project
i Do
Oh yeah
9and the SD stands for Suda instead of Super Deformed this time
SOrry, just mixed up
Don't you feel depressed sometimes when you're by yourself?
So it's Sudatcher?
9yeap
9Snatcher Radio Drama
06^
06mmhmm
9directed by Kojima, script by Suda 51
yeah, I read about it
9let's test something
9>BIG BOSS
9you might recognize this guy from Portable Ops. Somewhat
Do you mean Big Boss from Metal Gear?
9Cunningham was also a character in Portable Ops
9only he was black there
Yeah, Kojima sure likes to put references
9RESPECT MAH AUTHORITAY
B)
9yeah I think I prefer Gamepad
9mouse for some reason shoots to the screen right below the one you're actually aiming at
:U
9I think that about wraps up the testing section
That's kinda weird
A little Metal Gear va trivia: The Japanese voice actor of the Metal Gear Solid character Big Boss is the same as the Japanese va for Dr. Eggman from Sonic.

woot

07lol
Cannot computer
/me explodes
lol
*compute xD
13the fact that it triggers both responses bothers me |D
13Pretend the second one isn't there >w>
03It worked. Yay!
/me runs
lmfao
what does your script say?
10o.o
mine should be similar to espeon's
Sneas + Rape = Hollywood Movie
13if ($nick = Aurora) { describe $chan already belongs to you, silly :P }
13if ($nick = Espeon) { describe $chan already belongs to you, silly :3 }
13else { describe $chan already belongs to Espeon and Aurora, you thief D: }
13}
/me shot
in terms of trigger
...
03o.o
</random>
13I didn't make the script though, so I dunno how to edit it |D
03hm
03try changing that second if to an else if
that looks like it should work lol
03because the way that works
03it sees the first if
03then the second and else are treated as one
03so
03if nick = Aurora, do this
03if nick = Espeon, do this, otherwise do this
03hence Aurora triggers both
03that make sense?
03so try changing the second line to "else if"
13'kay, see if that works now
/me already belongs to you, silly :P
yep
13Yay :D
6:>
03:P
13Thanks drf :3
/me already belongs to Espeon and Aurora, you thief D:
03yeah OK
03no problem
03I'm not that great at scripts but I have experienced a similar problem before XD

6hello~? I'm different~?
Portal Turret plush = EPIC
6-~
6dwafmsgd
03is it going to have actual LEDs?
03er
10Bah, TST forum went down (and yes, I realize it was supposed to)
03lasers
03etc
6I wish lol
Imagine if it said 'I won't hurt you' with its funny little turret voice
03shoudln't be that hard to do if you get a laser pointer
03and just cut a hole in the fabric
03XD
that'd be unsafe for little children to point in their eyes :|
6my plushes are 100% huggable, nothing solid or potentially harmful inside
they'd probably just put little red lights
So 5mw is going to kill you?
:p
ok, good :P

hi
there, slightly less quiet
hello!
hooray
I just thought I'd say things to liven the place up
I try and encourage conversation from time to time, but no one ever seems to be around
Sad times
yes, where hath they all gone?
I didn't kill any of them with a rake, promise!
hey
7whoops
...you said nothing about other gardening tools though, and there is a bloody hoe sitting in the corner over there
I was gonna try and get people's attention so I could see if there's anyone available to add on Google+ :P
I am
:O
Can I put you in my acquaintances circle?
yes you may
I like putting people in circles
much better than boxes
:o
I did it!
yay people
Hopefully I got the right person
We're going out for a bit now, see you all another time
bye RN =D
yup, nice hat
thanks ^^
would you say that setting the affinity of a program to use only 1 core would be an effective way to determine how well a game would run on a single core machine?
Probably not
If the game doesn't require multiple cores, it won't make any difference, and if it does, it won't run on your machine :P
you can set the priority of the program if I recall though
yes, but I meant trying to simulate single core working conditions
are you on a single core pc?
setting affinity won't stop it using the other cores if it needs to use them if I remember correctly
no, quad core. I was playing L4D2 an hour ago, and just for curiosity sake I turned off cores 1 through 3, and left core 0 active
12ohnoes
it'll just always try to use the core you set an affinity for first
or, more likely, told the game to not use those cores
12Skull Kid ripped me off D:
ah
ok
actually, ignore me
I just clicked the affinity dialogue
and it's which cores is the program allowed to use
hmm
well, I did notice some performance decrease
now I want to see if I can limit the GPU usage to simulate an underpowered 512MB card, and maybe limite the RAM used to 2 gigs max
the Source engine is designed to be able to make use of multiple cores
so I'm not surprised you saw a performance decrease tbh
I have a friend with a 2.8Ghz single core machine, 2 gigs of RAM, and a Nvidia Ion GPU, 512 MB
I want to sim that condition so I can see what games will run on his comp
I see
I'm glad I don't have a machine like that
lol
yeah, he only ever buys refurbished and older models to save money
13I swear my memory is fading
06oo
13then after going through a few new messages, I opened a new tab and typed in lugia.us/forum
I'd have the most epic pc ever if I had a proper income
6lol
currently it's just pretty damn awesome
13I've actually done that several times now within the past 10 minutes .w.
really?
specs?
13It's just my first instinct to open a TST tab if I don't already have one open D:
Nvidia GTX460 gpu
8GB Corsair XMS3 DDR3 ram
two western digital caviar hard drives, one 500GB, one 1.5TB
XD
/me has TST set up as her homepage on Firefox
a corsair 650W PSU that I can't remember the name of
a DVB TV Tuner card that I forget the make of
rofl
on a Gigabyte full-ATX motherboard that again, I can't remember the model of :P
in an Antec 300 case with extra front fans installed by me
Mine too @angel :(
with two 24" widescreen monitors
I only have 1 23" monitor, but I plan on getting a second
I'm planning to get either a watercooling system for my CPU, or an SSD next
6I love how I decided to make a turret plush all of ten minutes ago
6well
6ok

EVERY DAY
So if all this week it's 'snatcher,' yet there's specials every day, um... Is there one movie every day with different episodes?
6Suddenly Dman
Suddenly yes
Hey there Sprinkles :)
6No, no movies. We'll be showing different things, that we normally don't get a chance to show.
Ah
so like an extended 'preshow' type thing? Well, sounds good, i hope the test run goes well
6Again, this week's a test run.
I can't make every friday or saturday, so I'd like this ^^
6Good then. Glad to please others with our ideas. : D
2 hours until Snatcher?
OFC i like your idea : D
also, i google 'snatcher interactive movie' and your poll comes up before any actual websites on snatcher lul
Hideo Kojima? I'm not reading any more, I wanna see this first hand : P
9Hideo Kojima, yeah
Hi there DCD, I haven't really seen you talk much. Probably cuz i'm not here all the time. So...um, do you like this game?
9are you kidding?
9I LOVE IT!
9also I'm the main Friday streaming, but due to personal reasons I haven't been around xD (Final Exams)
Great! So how's this gonna work?
9that's done though, so expect to see me around a lot
6this is such a soft fabric
I mean, if there's too many bronies we ... vote?
9well, Snatcher is pretty linear
Oh ok
9and if someone does "say something"
9doing it won't really have much of an effect in the end
12wbs Sky
9BUT I'll do it anyways
I'm sure many people will say stuff all the time. : P
10Thanks
Sounds like a good plan
9because they can unearth hilarious and entertaining stuff in the game
Everypony will feel involved that way - best livestream scenario
9I've already streamed this game before
WB Sky <3
I mizzed yous ;<
I haven't seen it : (
10You no longer have to worry
Will today :)
gah, I need to go to bed early again D=
Goodnight everybody! =D

12first half of Spirit Temple done
Nii

9but I'm saying I know what to expect
Ah, so you're not the one playing?

Yea, it IS early...but it IS a test run and not many people have programs that popup when you get emails ^^
The more the merrier i guess

13!espeon
I honestly can't remember, lol. It's been years since I've played that game.
12i hate fishing
12so much
12how come you can lift crazy heavy things like giant pillars
12but you can't pull a fish out of the water
What, fishing's the best part. I used to spend hours just fishing. xD
Call me crazy, lol.
04hi
/me shot
12take it from a crazy person
12you're not crazy
/me 12hides
12and Glacy
/me !$nick
Maybe on the surface I'm not. lol
12because
12darn .-.
12fishing poles are fragile
12wbs Slash
Now I want an Oreo milkshake.
ty, LL
03darn it, LL, my sister took the TV
12D:
03also LOL I just thought of something funny on the way home
12oh?
12milkshake
/me 12wants
UGH, I hate SonicStadium IRC >_> Im being B*tched at
/me just had a cookie :>
12xD
03<Link> UGH, I hate SonicStadium IRC >_> Im being B*tched at <- Given how you act towards me, I half want to say you probably deserve
03*it
/me hides
12...
12i hate this XD
No I'm being serious about this.
>_>
03are you being a jerk to anyone there?
Not entirely, but someone in there is being a complete ass to me in there
and he keeps trying to annoy my gf, which i find very irritating
12Who's your gf c:
so i snapped at him yesterday, and now i got the mods yelling at me
Tell him to suck it. That never fails.
12Ah
ah, I know exactly who that is.
muahahahaha.
no. you dont.
Do I? lol
lol i know someone who probably has 5 times more than him
as many games*
;p blah stupid typos
12Do you want to test my ownership script, Umbreon?
12no
;o
anyways, yeah, now im being yelled at by Roarey, the owner of TSS IRC
>_>
12i want to catch this fish
<3
Leashes
/me runs
12that won't take the bait but will just stare at it
12XD
Are you close to the water? lol
12i'm fishing so yeah
12i'm close to the water XD
The biggest fish is under the log near the front entrance.
I meant if you were actually in it. My bad. lol
12o.o
12the log is near the back I thought
12brb
12yes i'm in the water
Well, there's a log somewhere. xD
12there is multiple logs
Wherever it is, the biggest fish likes to hide in it.
It's, like, uhhh, how do I describe...
I need a picture, lol.
http://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda05/Fishing/FishingPond_BigFish1.gif
There ya go. That's exactly where, lol.
12back
WB LL
Brbs
12thats nearer to the beck :P
12*back
12tys
12i've been at this for hours but the biggest i've caught was like 8 inches
I'm going by memory, haha.
12everything else either doesn't take the bait or gets away
12as was I ;3
12Glacy
Yeah, but you're memory doesn't suck like mine. p:
12you have to wiggle and jerk it
Therefore I win.
12that'll catch their attention
LL, that sounded
nvm...
z.z
12and out of context...yah
12that was a gutter-mind's paradise of a phrase
That's why it's best to get as near as you can to the fish, but not close enough to scare them.
Yup :|
It gives you more wiggle room.
/me 12suddently lolz
12but
12Glacy
12make sure
12you do NOT
12catch the Loach first XD
12granted
12the odds of THAT are slim at best
12i'll try
12if it says 35 pounds
12throw it back
12I kid you not
12the adult Link Loach nullifies any prize you haven't gotten yet
12Piece of Heart and Golden Scale
12would be lost forever
12great after like 15 tries of getting the fish to take the bai
12t
12it lets go after like 2 seconds
12XD
this screen has too much blue on it
06~
I couldn't tell. lol
12XD
Now I feel like playing OoT. Last time I touched it was...
6 years ago. Damn.
12XD
/me 12also has that effect on people :3
I never understood the point of these scripts. lol
12:3
12i give up
12-.-
I used to spend hours and hours just riding on Epona shooting ghosts with arrows. So much fun.
12lol
12this is why i don't try getting 100% of the upgrades in LoZ it's usually 50 times harder than the story itself
12bbl
12kk
12kay
12 3DS already on red D:
12low battery power i know
12best part is that it's still low battery life when you turn 3D off and turn wireless off
12XD
12and sound
12also .-.
12I glitched it earlier
12made a block go into another one
12the graphics went spazzy
12ohhhh EVILNESS
too much blue
so here's some black
12making me go in as an adult, only to do 2 trhings and force me to go back as a child for about 20sec only to make me become an adult AGAIN to finish it D:
The Spirit Temple is the most boring, imo. Cause of that very reason.
/me 12disagrees
12in the original OoT
12it's only child, then adult
12none of MQ's repeating
12the worst was Shadow Temple imo
12the theme bugs me
Lol, I loved that level. xD
12tho the boss is <3
Different tastes.
12Bongo Bongo is
12WTF
12but
12GIANT DRUM ARENA
12is <3
/me 12shudders
12the whole spine thing scarred me .-.
The sad part is the fact you can kill him in less than two minutes.
12try under 30sec :P
I would if you were able to replay bosses like in Majora's Mask. ):
12Phantom Ganon, Barinade, Volvagia, and Twinrova can't be beaten under 1min
12you can ;3
12in OoT 3D
12boss gauntlet <3
I'm talking N64. lol
12either as individuals
12or all of them
12which has nothing on its 3DS remake :3
12OoT 3D will descend from the heavens and lead us to the promised land
I'd expect it to be better, lol, or else it wouldn't have sold.
/me 12hides
12Manly
12have you tried Master Quest?
A looooooong time ago on the GC.
12XD
12difficult or no?
But it was around the time Melee came out, so I didn't give it any attention.
I wish I can answer that question. xD
12lolz
12it was SO challenging
12that
04LL
04it's VERY challenging
04x-x
12it felt good to finally beat it ^.^
12now
12OoT 3D MQ
12is a nightmare and a half ._.
Sounds hot.
Sounds Manly
:)
12lolz
12worth every penny if you get OoT 3D
/me 12has...20+hours on it
Yes, BUY ME
Not to mention the 3DS pics
;D
/me shot
12and it came out a month ago o3o
12XD
So I'm stuck trying to get a 3DS from a block game at the Boardwalk. 1 dollar a game. XD
12LOL
Plus...with .mpo support
Heheh
12good luck XD
12tho
04LL
6lol boardwalk
12those ARE beatable
04That's a full day
6I was just thinking about that place
04you silly
12the block games
04- 4 hours or so though
04and heh
They are, just tough cause the machine's buttons are kinda jammed.
It's a ploy, I tell you.
12o_O
04I once beat the block game
04twice
Closest I've gotten was one row away from the 3DS. ):
12XD
What'd you get? lol
12closest I got in one of those
04Unfortunately it only had tickets, but that was still awesome
12was winning
12but it got stuck
04I got around 1,500 tickets
12and they were like: too bad
04..
04LL
04A-yoles :B
04*h
/me runs
12for a DS Lite tho
12way back when XD
That sucks, lol.
04haha
04You coulda sold it
There's also a claw machine with three 3DSs inside.
03EW SELLING YOUR DS LITE TO UPGRADE
Sooo frustrating.
12those are rigged
I'm very good at them.
03so then un rig them
/me hides

12not legal, Danny
03I have all of my DSes

/me hides
12so I would have sold it for a PSP or something
03anyway yeah I have my DS Lite, DSi, DSi XL, and 3DS
o_o
03the DS Lite I got as a replacement, from Nintendo, because my original fat DS broke :(
EW DSiXL
03The original fat DS is the best thing ever
Aww :<
03DS Lite is so flimsy
03but yeah
03I sent it in for repair
03they were like
DSiXL FTW
03'We don't have the parts, want a free DS Lite?"
03so I was like sure
You be hatin on te big~
/me has.. a DS.
No, the XL is completely pointless.
Doesn't everyone

I didn't have a DSi anyway :P
My DS is pink. . -.

/me should play OoT
owo
4i met someone who has the game and told him about the trick and he didn't beleive
I thought you have to shoot him with arrows though :<
also, there were those 'in 2nd person' .pdf files recently
4it took a while to convince him
They are so fun to read! especially the ones labelled 'Whoa'
Where do you get the game? o: Or do you use an emulator?
Jet
12lol

A store

4let's make a bet: if i lose the next random match, you shall ALL address me as king
12no
:/ So um what does command R do, and what did you pick up during the summer sales?
4me neither but who cares?? i do T_T
I'm still disappointed that the Snatcher "Sequel" is a radio drama.
/me 12...
Command + R is refresh. I haven't picked up a whole lot yet, mostly indie games
12LOL!
I read it was by Hideo Kojima on wiki, and stopped. I wanna see this first hand ^^
12change
I see
But there are a lot of new games that I can't play because my Mac is 3 years old
I got L4D 1+2 for only £7 (yup, UK) (Yup, didn't have L4d yet lol)
and in PC years, that's about 30 years.
My pc is a laptop and it sorta fails at gaming, but eh
04heh
yea you can't upgrade macs : /
well, you can put in a bit of ram, but yeah
I can barely run Civ5
Which I really want to try out.
That's why I started a 360 clan
12STFU Rauru
My clan members are playing some games right now, actually.
12your Mario-esque face doesn't impress me >:|

What games you on?
Reach, Section8 and pretty much everything.
12o-o
We're a for-fun clan
We're mostly planning on Battlefield3 since it's going to be huge!
Yup ^^
Me and the other leader aren't getting MW3 this year, sick of it.

dman: I remember when I thought school was important, glad you're smarter
luckily, uni is much more laid back
Razyn, in UK the law is till 16 then you can do further leading up to university. we have colleges but they are for follow ups to jobs after 16, rather than further education to uni, so college < further education basically : P
Bucked it.

That woman looks very occupied.

@Ghosties, I love the devs for putting that in : D
Big Fucking Gun....
The memories...
7Have fun, Chao. :3
BFG>>>>>>>>>>Fallout3's MARV
4thanks
BFG>>>>>>>FNV's Tesla cannon
>hasn't played fallout. >ever. : (
I only have memories of the RYNO...
I never got the BFG in DOOM, then again I was like 6 when it came out iirc.
OFC > BFG
So.
Buttons
4OFC?
(Orbital Magic Cannon)
I played DOOM when I was 4. I never moved AT ALL.
4Ah
I was too afraid to shoot anything.
: )
Dessur - I was shitscared of metroid prime hunters when it first came out
first game I actually fully immersted myself into, and yea...
TGPF how do you do that pink text thingy?
Dman: I've never played Metroid, except for Zero, which I'm playing at the moment.
/me
razyn /me
good man, zero's a great example of metroid
Test/me
?
I've played every Metroid aside from Prime 2, Other M and Hunters.
4although right now i'm just tcging
although, thinkking about it, metroid 2 has a very unique taste, like Majora's Mask, and metroid primes are 3d...hmm, there's not really a bad metrod game is there?
/me Test
All about Super Metroid.
well, pinball and other m are not as good as the rest
/me POWERTHRUST
TGPFluttershy, Prime no. 1
Dman: Metroid Pinball?
the rain on your visor with the choir music while staring at ruins
There was a pinball game?
6GOD
Dman, when it comes to Metroid games as a whole, they're equal
6I hate biting my lip
6it swells, so I KEEP biting it
@dessur, a DS game one of my bros IRL has. it isn't great.
Super Metroid, probably one of the best 2D games you'll ever play
I can play Fusion/Zero Mission over and over and over
Yea man, tgpfluttershy, they are
true dat
4LAWL
And then along came SOTN
Quick odd question: Can I advertise for BronyState?
6Depends.
I know i know pirating is bad hurr durr, but I have both zero mission and fusion, and I'd just like to say that wearing headphones while playing these games on tv from my wii (with my snes remote from clubnintendo) feels epic
It's a ten-second advert on my YouTube, SirSprinkles.
(i have both on gba already is what i meant)
6Sending you a PM, Des.
Thanks. I'll follow up.
I'm waiting for some GBA games on the 3DS
bound to happen, sooner or later.
I wanna get a 3DS, I still have the fat old DS.
6Des... *points to PM at the top of the chat*
I hope they do gba for 3ds, but i dont know if they will
and i hope they do GC games for WiiU
That's gonna be tough, but possible
As long as they put enough space in it AND give us the option to expand it.
also, hanging out on 4chan's /v/, and after wiiu announced on livestream, this
http://deltax20a.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/316319124.jpg
In 10 seconds flat. that's how long it took for someone to make this
lol
/v/
oooookay
SirSprinkles: Followed-up. Had to do something. Sorry.
I rarely go on 4chan anymore. but /v/ for E3 is godtier in terms of lolcontent
Picture broken!

:(
It's the new wiiu remote, and it reads
'Wii U Mad?' with a trollface on it
I'm nowhere but /sci/, they get trolled the easiest

I dunno, I kinda like the style
TGPF: Why? Looks good to me.
oh the joy of youth

It does.
10TY Chao
or...something.
But it's mostly for release and exposure sake
Junking looks... fun.
Well, um, i'm interested to know: will we pause and resume on tuesday, or wil this be played again tuesday?
Either way it's still Snatcher, which is pretty much synonomous with awesome.
9paused and resuming on Tuesday
Ah thanks DCD
Of course it is! But it would be even better if more would be exposed to it

8 2 different people
NewDCD Brofist hea
It's yourself!
Dman you use the emzymes to demerin the blood type IIRC
or maybe not
9they're probably referring to the elements that determine blood type. There are "anti-blood type" enzymes in the bloodstream
I see
8http://i.imgur.com/YcTa7.jpg
9for example, if you have Blood Type A
Okay, I admit it, it was me. I was hungry, and he had chinese! Still hungry, though.
9you have Anti-B type Enzymes
9if B, Anti A
9if you are AB, none
I'm only 17, but i plan to become a med student, and am on my way to rite now. That was interesting : )
THE MORE YOU KNOW
9if you have O, you got both
*
I have O
Cool.
If you are O, you can have either anti-A, or Anti-B
AND KNOWING IS HALF THE BATTLE
dat y bloodtipes can be rejected by people? mind=blown
G
I
8BMN: both fun AND educational!
Damn SNATCHERS.
O is best blood type
Hipster_brony dayum rait
listen to the corpse
Listen to him.
Listen to the blood.

Wait is it both or either? Or is it one at a time?
8>mfw i dont have the slightest clue what my blood type is
search the house. so specific
man playa, why you be feeling up this dead body?
Hipster
Mother lost, or 'lost' my birth certificate. Still to date don't know what time born or bloodtype : /
I'm A+
IF you donate your blood
I'm B- I think
they'll tell you
same hipster_Brony
I'm O-
I'm O+
it's on your medical records from birth, more than likely
Stick the key down his neck?
>MFW I can donate to half the other blood types without trobule
Im A+
Durr I meant O+
dammit silver, what're we gonna do if one of us has to give blood to the other?
8>mfw im too much of a candy vag to donate blood
O+ is the most common type
do ponies have bloodtypes?
Hipster, you're not a pussy
or can a unicorn donate blood to an earht pony?
Pinkie's Bloodtype is sugar
Just get friends to help you out.
8Dman: syrup type
Elky, we're going to kidnap RainBroDash and make him do it
I kinda like donating blood
Lol!
Pony Blood Types: Hay or Nay.
oh that would work silver
I passed out after donating blood, they raised my head too fast
Wait no, I don't have O. Stupid. I have RH or something like that. I think.
RainBroDash will do it if you offer him another CMC to roast
lol
we'll squeeze the stuff right outta him
8nah, i have a thing about needles

Senor Rodriguez's voice sounds kinda familiar... can't quite place it, though
'Due to extensive research done by the Fourchon University of Science, diamond has been confirmed as the the hardest metal known the man. The research is as follows. Pocket-protected scientists built a wall of iron and crashed a diamond car into it at 400 miles per hour, and the car was unharmed. '
when you spam scripts
' They then built a wall out of diamond and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an out into the wall, and the wall came out fine. They then crashed a diamond car made of 400 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors. They crashed 400 miles per hour into a diamond traveling at iron car. Western New York was powerless for hours.'
*thunderclap*
*horror movie music*
' They shot a diamond made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused two wayward airplanes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with two buildings in downtown New York. '
Thank you, silvermane. I enjoy reading quite a bit.
# They spun 400 miles at diamond into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive. Finally, they placed 400 diamonds per hour in front of a car made of wall traveling at miles, and the result proved without a doubt that diamonds were the hardest metal of all time, if not just the hardest metal known the man.#

03ROFL
12o-o
12why is it so hard to create a replay in tF2
ohwow
04LL
04How long was OoT3D in development you think?
129001 years
04I need a serious answer
12umm
03why does it matter
03"a long time"
12since b4 the 3DS's release
12More then likely since the release of OoT DS, since it takes that long to make a remake like that
12like
12it's like a remake of 2 games +
12so we're talking a couple yearsd
12-d
12yeah
12However, it takes such a long time to make a game, that they more then likely started working on it right after the last remake.
!say !defective
!defective
Uhhhh... Blam! Blam blam blam! I'm not defective!
12As funny as it sounds, they would have been working on the 3DS since after the making of the DSi
12inb4 started after they made the Virtual Boy :B
/me 12hides
3DS is a failure
12lol
whos better: Nintendo or SEGA
/me FLEES
12Nintendo
Sega
12Both, since they work with each other
12"z"
12...56 translations later we get:
12"L"
12http://brutalgamer.com/2011/04/25/over-3-5-million-3ds-units-sold-worldwide/
033.5 million compared to the 7 billion people is niothing
03*nothing
127 billion of what?
x.x please sto pwith the 56 translations thing
12someone should get a computer and put this video on auto refresh until it gets to 100,000 views
stop with*
12for the achievements
Link, please stop with the whining
>>
03LOL
12it was just once
12link relax
yes, but yesterday you guys did it alot
12that was yesterday dude
12this is today
03Link
03that's like saying
03you only used that face once
12k[20:58] 7 billion of what? <-- So?
03in a day
03:P
drf i havent used that face in days ;p
03I know
03notice I haven't yelled at you for it?
03I was just putting things into proportion
mhm
Hey guysI gotta go
;_;
12now if you excuse me i'm going to watch guys microwave a propane tank
12Eh, nevermind drf. And I think you mean million.
03no
03there are 7 billion people on the planet
033.5 million is like a tiny number in comparison
12That's 3.5 million in just a few months
12And that's very good considering it's over $250
03how many original DSes sold?
12derp
12144.59 million units
03yeah
033.7 is a very small percent of that :P
12But like I said, in just a few months xD
03still
03you made it sound like 3.7 was this big number
03it's big comapred to 100 but it's not that big compared to most other video game system sales
12Yeah, it will take a price change for it to get there
12Which always happens
12And since it can play DS games, anyone that wants a new DS will end up buying a 3DS
/me sighs
03the DS upscaling on 3DS is horrible
03it COULD be a lot better
I know x.x
fuzz everywhere
12HML, that's your bad eye sight
/me runs
03and mine?
Yeah
03look up any user review, most people say it's terrible
12JK
03the system itself is alright but has a lot of major annoyances
12Just as many say it's awesome
03no, WI mean the upscaling part specifically
03I haven't seen a single review that said they like the way standard DS games look on the 3DS
12That's because they don’t know to turn off the 3D when playing an old DS game
03...
03implying that actually makes a differen*ce
03the 3D light turns off meaning there IS no 3D
NS is derping
12yep
I actually refuse to play DS games on my 3DS
And I only have 1 3DS game for now
03same
o.o
03http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/hey_yo_swear_taco_bell_hkZFW0IQFOXWyKQ2rb74gI
03LOL
lol
XD
She is always watching on us
12Indeed
12Anyways, I have a 3DS, and the old DS games look just as good on it to me.
Maybe YOU need glasses?
/me runs
And lol, it seems I've been keeping the 3D on the 3DS on max for around 80-90% of the time
12Because the screen is actually better and has smaller pixels then the DSi screen
12than*
Everyone should just get a DsiXL if they want to play DS games
INB4 EW DSiXL
12derp
12I had one
12Then I sold one
So did I
My one got stolen ;.;
Which is why I got the 3DS
Brb
03it got stolen?
12I also have a phat DS that I kept
Good night guys :D
12hm? lol
12Good night
12goodnight jet

7Well, if anyone's abound, I've had another pseudo-lucid dream.
7This time involving stalking Robin Atkin Downes. O__o
06heya Quan
7Came just in time to hear about a pseudo-lucid dream I had about stalking Robin Atkin Downes. >>
06O.o
7For some reason, I found R.A.D. in a mall. I think he was part of some sort of treasure-hunt-esque activity there, which ended with slingshots.
7But that's a digression.
06mmhhmm
7I met him, asked him some stuff, and suddenly, a group of fangirls appeared.
7He did so, and then he asked to leave.
7He left, but then I remembered that there was one question (in real life) everyone was asking him and he never responded to: Did Valve ask him to voice more lines in-game?
7By this time, he was walking along some rural dirt patch.
7path*
06hm...
7So I dream-flew (dunno exactly, it happens in my dreams a lot) over to him.
7It took me a while to get to him. O3o
7So, I asked my question, and he responded, "Well, there are those cut-out lines from Meet the Medic..." (Or something to that regard.)
7I still was curious about what he was doing, so I continued to follow. While he was amiable at first, R.A.D. got increasingly annoyed.
7I forget what happens after.
7Gah, gotta go.
Quanyspam
06bies quan :3

6Okay, back.

6I dunno, it's almost like foreshadowing.
6Or fangirlism. :P
06mmhmm xD
6Hrm.
6On a randomish note, I wish I could induce these pseudo-lucid dreams without being at a loss for sleep.

hmm
yo
hey!
'sup?
nm. just dropped in to see if anyone was here.
Welp, this place stays pretty much quiet outside of scheduled streams
yeah. hold on 1 sec
Ok
much better.
Forgot to change my name XD
heh
so what about you?
Eh, just browsing some ponychan and listening to some music
heh. yup. Tuesday mornings suck XD
Well, it's evening for me :P
What country are you in?
6:28 PM, to be exact
Finland
ah. 10 am here XD
US, I assume?
yup yup
Alrighty
I usually have things to do in the mornings but didn't have anything today.
I have work until next week's wednessday, so I don't have to worry about that
Just wake up in the morning, prepare some stuff for lunch, go to work, get back and browse ponies
Sounds like fun
yup
Eh, depends on the weather
I'm off this week :p
Since I work outside, and today it happened to rain, so...
Alrighty
What do you do?
Hmm, for this summer's job I'm just kind of building parks.
hmm that's cool. Like playground parks?
Yeah, stuff like that
12 Hello, Polarfire and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
Not very interesting job, but it ain't that bad
ah. yeah. Pay good?
9,8 euros per hour
Pretty decent for what it is
that's good.
hmm.
Has Dari been up yet?
Haven't seen him say anything
Oh.
Anything good on ponychan XD
Some pretty random stuff on /chat/, as usual
Or perhaps it's still more sane than /oat/
lol.
Anything else you wanna talk about? XD
Eh, I don't have much on my mind right now :P
yeah. I'm probably gonna go do something soon.
Alrighty
just not sure what XD
:P
I know the feeling
yup yup...
What kind of food do you like XD
I just ate some wok food. Noodles mixed up with some fried vegetables and chicken
I think it's pretty good
yummy.
that does sound good.
Yep, and it's pretty quick to do, to boot
Just about ten minutes or so
that's cool.
What kind of sauce did you use?
Something like sweet & chili
oh. I ate cereal :p
It wasn't very good :(
cinnamon toast crunch. Its actually my favorite but cereal just wasn't good this morning. I could have made an omelette or something since I didn't have anything to do.
Ah, alrighty then
yup.
What did you eat for breakfast?
Tomato and a couple of sandviches
I've been eating muesli for breakfast for so long so I decided to take something else for change
muesli?
Yeah, it's kinda like cereal
ah. Well I'm going to go meet a friend for lunch, so I'll talk to ya later.
Nice talking to ya!
Alrighty, same to you

ahahahaha
06heh
I sense a great deal of the wrong attitude there
06orly?
06sometimes, but not always :3
racism is one
true enough, lighty. lol
hey everyone
I got Pokemon Heroes on DVD yesterday and even though its a brand new release what I ended up with was the very last copy in stock at the local Target
Nice
that might say something
I did the same thing too
although I got two movies in one cd
ugh
it was in a sale pile
that stupid combo pack with Destiny Deoxys
EWW ADVANCED GENERATION!
how dare they put a pokemon movie in a sale pile
because it did not sell
I got the Voice of the forest and Heros together
most US viewers tend to focus on the past or only know about it
I do both
the past and the future
I hate the present and future
only focusing on the past
I'm equal
I like all
but with pokemon
and other anime
Dawn I found annoying and boring
how?
May I found to be just plain annoying
bland personality
O.o
plus Ash not getting any better and still making the same mistakes over and over
Thats whats fun about him
not realy
its repetitive
Ash learns something then forgets it quickly
you can critizise it
thats why its fun
nope
thats why its repetitive
and annoying
I got sick of Ash not long after I started watching
without that there wouldn't be any good rps and fanfictions
not really
you can have fan fiction without Ash being a dumb*censored*
I read tons without Ash being dumb
but the ones I do read are hilarious
the way the author wrote it
Brock I got annoyed with too
his "gag" got old fast
as did Ash being a moron
remember the episode when Misty was separated from Ash and Brock and only had That Marril and Pikachu with her?
yes
When that woman was running down the cliff I was thinking. "MAN HOW DOES SHE RUN IN THOSE HEALS.?! Shes tougher than she looks
XD

Hi, lightlugia.
12Lakorv, how are you? :>
I'm decent, thanks
12Also unusual to see you here ^v^
oh, I am around every now and then.
a little ;P
not so regularly, but I exist.
12^^
Ra
12and well.. I don't know if I am fully comfortable with her walking back alone ovO
12I'm just a bit worried
you're worried for nothing
she's back.
Arty you're a worried mother bird
Irony is haunting me.
07Hi all :>
07what now, Lakorv?
lol
*there
07Lakorv was it what you told me on Skype? Or something else this time
darn
I thought tha was a script
07Articuno, I am well. Don't worry ^^
that makes you more huggable Arty
Minnet, be dead in a fire.
/me is dead in a fire.
07o3o
07lol.
oh okay
Lol
mean
12I am.. waiting around for Lugia to finish up his part
Articuno: what are you two doing anyway?
07Ah
07coding going okie?
Minnet: be a silly floofpile.
/me is a silly floofpile.
12We're just upgrading the forum, but the problem is that after that we have to upgrade the code that bridges the site to the forum
07Ah
I see..
07Keep getting distracted?
12Lugia isn't even finished setting up his "testing server" to work on
06Minnet: be a floofcat
12Nah just that it takes ages to copy that much data >v<
07Ahh...
12I persdonally would just work on the live files LOLOL
Hai Arti!
07Haha
12But it always goes wrong for me :3
12and hi!
I should probably add that Minnet has a rather rigid user database for command access.
07BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!
12XDDD
07haiburd
07Also, Articuno - I caught that you noticed me reading all day, I thank you for lending me your laptop, though I'm fine you know ^^ I'm actually kind of just falling back to how I normally am at home, sans doing chores around the house because it's not my place/the kitchen would be crowded at times
07I'm usually quiet, doesn't mean I'm upset or bored. I forgot to mention as I was leaving, but I did mention to Xai
07Because I remembered that my silence has been taken for arrogance before and I don't want that ^^
Minnet, be annoying!
/me is annoying! >:)
07^-^
07How are you, Minnet?
07Yaaay
07Evening, Minnet!
dang it you made my computer lag
07Oops
if a version reply made it lag..
07Lakorv!!
might be the browser's handling of mibbit, but I dunno.
07you're a feesh

07Yes
07you're right

07i didn't object much though, as I was hungry. Though I do admit I was a bit skeptical :p
Minnet: shut up.
Fine, I'll just shut up.
07Ah
