THIS IS SPARTA1
I am intrigued by this B movie.
I love Asterix. I read lots of his comics and saw many of it's aniomated films. Really enjoyable.
best studio
This movie?.. The old one...
Childhood, Here I come!
dat ideafix
why does this remind me of the intro to borat.
It's a me mario, let's a go watch the show now. Waahooo!
Firelight, is there a new one?
This is the only animated Asterix not to be based on any of the comics.
da fuq?
What is this i dont even
SpadeMagnes[R] facing thos big heartless?
the musics so cheerful
:)
My favorite Asterix animated film is where they go to Britain.
here comes the sun! *dananana*
Dken2021: Worse... the Eliminator
The music! It's too catchy!
Dan: mine too :)
in german the name of this movie was "asterix conquers rome"
/me dances to the music
this is my fav movie from asterix
I saw this last night. I know Re-run. My Ratings on it was DUHFUQ/10

the 4th wall no longer exsits
Ave, true to Caesar!
I'd say the fourth wall struck back.
That narrator has such a soft voice.
4th walls are for the weak.
Dken2021: Actually you know the Defender heartless?
"Whom do you think you are kidding mister Caesar?"
how old is that comic?
I see someone said "Hey, let's get rid of the 4th wall at the start of the movie"
there is no 4th wall
Or rather, the 4th wall goes the opposite way
70s?
logic
SpadeMagnes[R] yea, know what you're talking bout
Dken2021: Its a red one and it hits like a fucking truck with status effects
reminds me a little of monty pyton
lol
you all will find out soon tht this Movie doesn't care anything about the 4th wall XD

11,02Dem women.
dem lips
DIG THAT FLOWERFIELD
08,01Unnr: but there were similar works before that exploiting even temperment. i'd say that if one to argue that case, one would be looking more to the instrument makers than to any specific composer.
Virgin Islands?
SIRENS........never trust them
Actually, the sirens would sing so that people would jump off their ships into monster infested water, so... They kind of ruined the whole point.
Hothothothothothothothothothothothothothothothot
:O
Sing better than Cacophonix!
isle of pleasure
Virgin Islands.

the isle of plesure
I have a feeling Chrysalis has something to do with this

Couldn't they think of a name which wouldn't be so dirty?
aisle of pleasure? seems legit!
Are we in the Siren Amazon?
O3O
Hothothothothothothothothothothothothothothothot

then the Hunters of Artemis arrive and fuck shit up.
tea's ready
PADDING TIME! :D
Song?
Musical Travel Commercial
Filler
Acleps: the point of the island of pleasure is to keep people people there forever. they neglect thier lives and eventually die

The sirens were actually just a trio of vultures with the face of women that would hypnotize sailors with their song and make them crash.
we get it, move on
Acleps: The island of Pleasure is intended because the island belongs to venus, god of love. With love comes her curelty and pleasure. People stuck on her island are thouse who give up honest work and sumbit to plesure. They will eventually die in plesure
After they leave captain Kirk beams down.
BIG LIPPED ALLIGATOR MOMENT alexxm
RAWRity: Ikr
Food.
11,02I would ask for Food too :3
Food!
food is best pleasure
fooood
Forever
Get me a SAMVICH woman!
Disregard women, acquire food

RAWRity: harpies are just a bunch of ripoffs
They are not to eat
grant any wisah, ask for food
11,01Food does bring pleasure.
OF COURSE!
Dark92Enigma, 30 years later or so, Naruto went into fillers for about 70 episodes.

MadSurge: more like the harpies are just another version of the Furies, another trio of birdwomen that served Hades and tortured the souls in Tartarus
Kandarihu EEYUP, totally my point.......Hell, at least DBZ filler is enjoyable (IMO)
Bros before Hoes

Dark92Enigma: Naruto has a plot, da fuck are you talking about?

Dark92Enigma astrix had the hypnotist hypnotise himself

I think he said 8 dozen
Yeah this scene does that to people
He's thinking with portals
the isle of pleasure?
FOOD PORN
eww
they require WAY BIGGER FOOD
it all looks so delicious
But can he eat Soylent Green? That's a REAL test!
OH my lord.
cow plot?
bakers dozen
dat caviar

All that meat and no mead? O_o
And he carries that all with one hand.
this is not enough for even ONE titan >:(
NOW YOU'RE PLAYING WITH PORTALS

Baby toast.
HEEEEUUUGH Caviar

Elephant stuffed with Olives
I wonder what a camel tastes like...
A ELEPHANT :o
AN ELEPHANT*
sergio_scriptor, with olives
What, no crocodile?
Now I want to eat a camel..
even the toast?
Dark92Enigma no he managed to get the hypnotist to say he was a wild boar
sergio_scriptor: Grammer!

ouchie
Dat beast
Why did they enter my house?
/me dusts ittany_Discord
i have been enjoying morrowind so far
Nittany_Discord:
dat skeleton arm
And if you thought the Isle of Pleasure was trippy...
seems legit
sprint, spear throwing, melee, pleasure island, hypnosis, food
08,01Unnr: i'm not arguing that WTC isn't an important work; it had some wonderfully novel realisations of new insturmental technologies and trends in composition, and hell, it even started a few. But all in all, I'd argue that Eroica had more that was novel for its time in terms of orchestration, structure, and a general disregard for traditional ideas of the fundamentals of what music was.
:O
but that anticlimatic ending has a great line
dat Carnival ticket seller
The race, the spearthrowing, the judo, the isle of pleasure, the hypnosis and the meal.
neat'o! Fun game?
yes
takes some getting used to
Yes, follow the glowy skelton!
Yellow
So much yellow text, it's beautiful!
cause you have to rely on your journal to know where to go
this part scared the crap outta me when i was a kid

11,01This movie has interesting sounds.
this can only end well
Weird ass bats.

Night everyone who is leaving. Time for me to go too!
also, for anypony who missed the frist or secound movie, wait for Eruo-movie night
Send them the link in Vinyl
This event was for the pegasi of Ponyville, not Cloudsdale. It's the sole responsibility of them to produce the tornado. Just because the Wonderbolts are physically capable of helping the tornado doesn't mean that the task falls to them or any of their members.
11,02mishia: Okie :3

#Vinyl_Scratch
Where i am it's 1 hour after midnight, and i think this music is amazing
Heya Lunar_Brony
If anypony whants to request
I'm guessing this was done in order to prevent a system of hyperdependancy on a small number of pegasi that could either corrupt and become an oligarchy or outgrow their role leaving nobody to take their place.
11,02Request channel is #Vinyl_Scratch
So, anyone have been playing GUILD WARS 2 ?
thx :)
keep in mind he works his way up the list, so eventually he tells everyone to stop requesting so he can complete them all

Oh this is EPIC!
this ride sucks
they need a bigger tram
RIDE, THE JAWS
Too bad, otherwise I'd play with you.;
THIS IS SO COOL!
Lunar_Brony's brain is currently being overloaded with a phenonenom known as "WHAT THE BUCK AM I WATCHING?!?". This is a pre-recorded message. Do not respond to this message.
they need a bigger boat
needs more Fonzie
you do realise this is fake,right?
they need a bigger baot
*boat
here comes the jaw :3
Quick_Thinker: Then you'll be glad to know it's closed.
I've been on that.
were gonna need a bigger boat
EVERYPONY, I MADE THIS VIDEO! :$
they cant even get a person out there to wave hi
WHAT DAFUQ?
so realistic
CountDoofus: YOu did?
yeah, costs to buy it, but there's no monthly fee
this ride... jumped the shark...
a nice gift for cloppers http://9gag.com/gag/4822919 have nice dreams >D
It only costs to buy it initialy
Eeyup!
seems legit :D
i love how this ride isnt even in the ocean xD
Where is this ride?
no monthly fee is epic
so much lag
funny how he happens to have a grenade launcher
Buck....
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: xD
your account is BTim1984?
BUCK
That is pretty damn epic
BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
DocSane Universal Orlando
xDDDD
Yup.
AH, okay.
But I don't really have money to spend on games right now.
Dat acting
oh crap.
is.. is that a shotty in the boat?
tripple A Actor
Jaws 3 was in amusement part
OHHHZ NOO
iv'e only been to universonsal hollywood
That was me saying "Oh, boy." :D
That guy tries SO HARD to act as if this is amazing
it's not out until next month
jaws is way bigger than that
grednade XD
I preordered it about a year ago and paid off ~$5/month
Dat GL
xD
Grenade LAUNCHER FTW
that aimbot
this man is so chill
O.o
-not even aiming at right spots
next game on my list is probably going to be Watch Dogs
11,02There's a baby on the ride O.o
You could preorder it already then?
noob toobin'
bored
derpy_pony cuz they're not very smart
game looks amazing
all fishers have a GL in case of sharks
SuperBrony64: Babies are good Shark Attractors
Dat Crying baby..
SuperBrony64: D: Poor baybe
11,02Great job parents
lets go into the dark tunnel :3
yeah, it's been on the list for gamestop for a while now
baby disapproves
:33333
why would you bring a baby
Who brought a baby on Jaws the Ride? Which redneck had that bright idea?
Dark tunnel timeeeee!
because NOTHING will traumatize a baby with fears of sharks than to take said kid on JAWS rides :)
alexxm: troll parents
I can buy it in disc form?
This isn't FUNNAAAAYY!!
redneck lol
I remember way, way back in time, Universal Los Angeles had a Battlestar Galactica portion of the tour.
FUCK YOU DOOR
yep
a baby on a jaws ride?
O.o That baby D:
humans should form a symbiotic relationship with dolphins....
/me rubs chin thoughtfully
Poor thing
SuperBrony64: hey look, lets go in the dark ride :3333333
11,02So...they based the movie off of the ride?
someone shut that fucking baby up
ohh thought he would bust through it
never attacked by sharks again
Those poor tourists! They're all gonna die!
When in a dark tunnel on rides liek that I have to ask, "Did you touch my ass?"
that's my plan, I prefer the games with a disc tbh
Intriguing.
SuperBrony64: apparently yes xD
Same here.
SuperBrony64 seems legit
Team Brony?
5
XD
OH SHIT
11,02mishia: Oh mai o///o
10 min yet his house was like 3 min away
I jumped
Team brony??!
11,01Mechanical sharky!
steam is nice for the indie stuff though
That Shark is so retarded
Random fire!
boom!
nice effects
suddenly explosions
D:
SuperBrony64: hes a member of team brony-
MADE BY: MICHEAL BAY.
Dang. Pyrotechnics.
did Jaws roar?
And not just because I'm not capable of downloading 25 gigabytes in a timespan shorter than two weeks.
theres your park money at work
i have been there befor
:D I remember this ride - I was unfortunate to sit on the edge where the shark leaps out of the water, I jumped up and tried to push my brother to my right over
THROUGH THE FIRE AND FLAMES
This is so intense. I don't think they're gonna make it
That baby's gonna need therapy.
fire on water?
fire water
hasn't changed in 10 years i see
Cheif Brony?
why was there an explosion
that was awesome
SuperBrony64: failure on the shark, the fire is badass
greek fire
That poor baby :'(
Lunar_Brony yep. He did it with his lungs.
herostar_Discorded: that can happen if theres oil on the water
Zephyr: it closed at the start of this year.
shark = good shock value
I like having my things digital copy, because I won't have to bring the games anywhere if I move and such
people are thrilled
Oh man, I remember going on this ride.
ik, it's also the name for A rum, darkts
Fun times.
use your GL
That kid crying on the boat? Going to be afriad of sharks for the rest of their life.
11,01Touch it!
useless bastard
11,02AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Good job parents!
11,01It feels good.
11,02AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Entire boat just stared at me and laughed - I was a bit embarresed :)
bom
xD Im scared as fuck
Is it me, or they keep depending on random entities for the Shark to attack just for amusement
Ironicly, I am currently away on a connection where I'm unable to download my games
It's just not the same seeing it in a video.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
eep :(
gonna need a bigger gun
11,01Touch the wire.
looks just like it did in the movie
11,01Touch it!
ded
Yay!
I REMEMBER THAT WAS SO SCARY
It's just a little animal
11,01Aww.
man if fluttershy was on it she would have flown up to it and gave it a hug
poor shark
Thats the part I jumped up - damn thing was just inches from :D
fried shark
Best Parents Ever >.>
Huntedmansion was scaryer. u know why? it relied on atmosphere. in fact, the eye area was the worst.
dat tour guide
the only issue I have with the digital distribution is that they have a clause that if you don't play the game in so long they can remove it from your list
yay...
this is brony where are you?
I love that ride.
fish and chips any1?
:)
BEWARE THE VOODOO SHARK
Be right back.
And the breathing door was good to. creeeepppy
Firelight: Sounded like he said so didnt it?
...i'd go on this ride...
Heh i love the heat fire
there should be an actor on the boat
baby still not satisfied
Wait what
Would Steam do that?
like he would be caught by Jaws
or did they?
Do they...do they actually?
the tour guide should've been the awesome badass hunter on safari or something
Jaws was only scary when he was burnt.
SKipidy Do da
How bored is this guide?
just to add a bit more awesomeness
Bored shitless :)
I wonder what Peta thinks of this o.o
8,6was a good ride, but it was showing it's age
well it must suck saying the same thing over and over
I like how people drunkly yell in agreement
AGAIN
Yay. That was great!
not again
yeah, its buried in there somewhere
SB "yellow seapony" song?
I liked the Jurassic Park ride at Universal LA
yay
the Amazom Tour over at Disneyland was more realistic than that
Ah yes.
this song is neat-o

This is pretty cool
LOVELY
that was great
:(
Girl dressed up like Dinky saying she loves Derpy. I see what they did thar.
Totally true1
I hate the name pegasister!
<3
nice
i feel awesome now
Kandarihu: The jab wasn't strictly true but I really have no problem with taking any excuse to make fun of FOX.
11,01Not a fan of that song really.
Kandarihu: No, just the one time they did mention MLP fandom.
good
Any other girl bronies??
yay this one looks awesome
OH BOY :O
mishia gota love and tolerate yo.

Kandarihu: So, I can say that Fox News has bashed the fandom 100% of the time they've mentioned it
they gonna make a series about this
xd
suddenly uncle

whoa!
DocSane: thats good. most kids my age however dont let girl bronies have brohooves are even consider them part of the herd
Kandarihu: It's been more than once, and nearly always on Red Eye, which is basically just a less funny response to Jon Stewart
Japanese is so awesome language
whut ಠ_ಠ
What's with all the pixelation?
fluttermac fanfic <<
the term bro is genderless
I couldnt even listen to this song without ponies
This song is catchy
> put sweetie belle in the corner
what are they even pixelating
/me bobs head
MaxTheBrony: Yiddish is funnier though.
> instant ponification
mishia: How young are you?
sweetie bell goes so well with this for some reason
EspyLacopa: haha Yeah !
Sweetie-Bot
pixelate everything!
japanese has pixel-fetish?
Maybe we should do a response to Greg Gutfeld, and leave the rest of FOX News out of this.
DocSane: 14. in my school they dont consider me a brony :(
:O
this reminds me of rythem Heaven.
For those not in the know: the author had to distort the original video to avoid DMCA.
Im hoping high school will be better
mishia: Weird. But then, kids are weird. :)
why is everything pixelated
why fluttermac? because they are both shy or sumthin?
im 16
alexxm: due to copyright
18 here
this is why teenagers do weed
nastolgia
Im 16 aswell :)
i'm 13
Oh, you silly children...
I got a friend who doesn't get why stuff gets ponified. I showed him a picture of ponified Final Fantasy VII characters, and he was about ready to punch me. :D

well robots are from japan so sweetie bell is perfect

howd we start on this?
Great, I seem to be the oldest part here. I'm 28.
:o
how did we get here?
CountDoofus: your special
well i did watch the show over my school year but never really talked about ut
yes am not oldest 24
I assure you, you're not the oldest here. I am.
CountDoofus: Nah oldest we have is around 40 or 50
CountDoofus: I know for certain there's at least one 30-year-old on here.
*kidnaps everyone older than him and dumps them on the moon*
ded?
xD
CountDoofus well i know a guy here in his 50s
only reason for sticking around: sweetiebelle
Yes.
Lunar_Brony: i wear my pony shirt with pride. Now to tell a girl is a brony, ethier ask her if she has heard of Cherrlie, check for ponies/shirts with ponies, or say a qoute of your choice near her
*is astronaut*
FOX News has a conservative bias to counter the liberal bias of the rest of the news media.
:$
kirzstryfe: what game were you talking about?
40 or 50? nice
oh hi Reikim
Isn't Kencolt in his 50s?

Really. I think the reason for ponifying characters is because the design style of these ponies is somewhat modular in nature. People make their own OCs, and naturally this also carries over into fanart. It's like remaking popular characters in wrestling games or MMOs.

I love this :)
*FAcehoof*

11,01Lol Sumica
11,02Wow...this is awesome

<3
o_o
Again?ಠ_ಠ
yes
Why do we watch this 5 times a day? :D
aaw yesyesyes
This is how I sound when I go to the bathroom...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
oh my
Its awesome :)
I love this animation...
mfw when people suggest the things we watch every day
gooood
/me is bored, facehoofs
Because its aweome firelight
i fucking love this song
what am I doing with my life . . .
no clue Firelight but its good
Firelight: BECAUSE IT'S AWESOME
Firelight: first time ive seen it on here
Listen to the voice crack, soon.
Luna <3
this is the kind of stuff people should request
how many times have we seen this
You know, even after thr fourth or fifth time, this doesn't get any less spine-chillingly creepy.
Nice crossover. I've never seen this
-.-
/me hugs Luna
LISTEN TO THE VOICE CRACK... i think its coming soon
I would go with Luna :)
is this the new that bloody moon with the three ponies goin' NA NA NA NA now?
this reminds me of Anastasia
This one again...I constantly have trouble have sleeping, waiting for Luna to take me away. :(
is this a rewrite of something?
the sketch animation is fiting
and fluid
It's both sweet and foreboding at the same time.
I'd like to see this finished
Isnt this for Pans Labyrinth?
OH OH OH
11,01I hope someone suggested Sea Ponies for Sumica
I can't say it enough
VOICE CRACK. SOON.
its the same background music to that Anastasia song
so enchanting
but I cannot wait for this video to be done
dat crack
Knowing Sumica, she'll end her streaming with Sea Ponies.
11,02Best song ever.
now. voice crack!
Animation is almost 75% Done Btw.
lol
For shoo be doo.
The movie this song was from is Hocus Pocus, though its a cover of the song
No, it's from, um, crap what's that Bette Midler mov ie?
OH NO!
xD
voice crack!
I love the voice crack
:)
Sumica is streaming?
Nighty Bronystate
the animation style of this one is good I think
Super is
the voice crack is actually fitting
Midnight_Fyre: I think this is from Wicked.
I thought Superbrony was
g'night Jim
it's unique and all
*floats away*
so elgant and flowing
No, not wicked
/me is so relaxed right now
GilDash|Dancing: A very mature and dark take on lunas path to darkness, Again show has the potential to be like this but for the sake of kids nope
this sounds familiar but ive never seen this vid, is it a rewrite of something?
I just like that Luna gets some love in this aniamtion
it'll come to me
The girl who sings dragonborn comes would be good at singing this
I like this time of animation for a lullaby
Midnight_Fyre: Its from Hocus Pocus
8,6wonder how many people it took to fit her into that stall
If the work in progress is so stunning, I can't wait to see the finished product.
its the same background music to that Anastasia song
she kidnapped them...
I think this is one of the few songs that qualify for the status of siren song.
aaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwww nuzzle
this creeps me out for some reason
SeaponiesofLiverpool, wut?
/me opens fortune cookie tage reads that was not chicken.
/me cries a manly tear at this wonderous beauty
This song is based on the one in Hocus Pocus
That's it, Hocus Pocus. I knew the movie, but couldn't think of the name
EpicWubTime WHAT?!
a siren song defintly
love this song
11,01Lol kirzstryfe
11,0115
alexxm: It's supposed to. It's about kidnapping.
"Once upon a December"
Lunar_Brony: is she suposed to lead the children to thier death?
Dat Amnesia.
Reikim: I didnt know dat D;
in the movie Anastasia
this has potential to be scarier than the rainbow factory
11,02Wow, that was an AMAZING song
alexxm: to be fair, this song was used in the movie to lure children into the woods so the witches could suck out their life force
it has the exact same sound
killerpony7733: I love trying to figure out what made Luna Nightmare Moon. That's singlehandedly why she's in my top five ponies list.
thats what this reminds me of, the sirens from the sinbad movies
OH GOD
Again?
SuperBrony64: IKR!
This again xD
I won't mind being kidnapped by luna
luna is the best foulnapper
11,01Again?
XD
Lunar_Brony: the nature of the song is sad and creepy and beutfil, ment to attract, yet the darker tone indicates death and enterinty
If Luna were to sing to me like that, I'll follow in a heartbeat. No questions asked.
...Orgy.
Badgers!
NAOW

08,01Nittany_Discord: actually, homosexuality *was* illegal in scotland until 1981
08,01it was legalised in 1967 in england
making stuff like that illegal is fucking retarded

I love this song to bits. But I have to say, the Maasaki Endoh version is 200 times cooler.
Reikim: what? i love this version better
11,025:38
Bronysith: epic picture :D
11,01I don't know if there's still a debate over Ritalin treatment in the US.
Reikim i like both versions to be honest

Reikim: it helps me right battles in my stories
11,01There was when I was a kid in the 90s.
yea i was forced to take it as a kid in the 90s
Nittany_Discord: I used to be on ritalin, so probably not
Nittany_Discord: what was the problem with Ritalin?

11,01And some parents thought ADHD was a joke.

Percy has ADHD
11,01Others thought it was an excuse to medicated kids.

11,01And control them.
OohShiny: /)

OohShiny: No, he's hard-wired for combat because he's part-god.
some say ADHD, I say multi tasking
Reikim: simon?

yeah Reikim
I know
:)
08,01also, being transsexual was only declassified as an illness in the UK in 2002
Reikim: he also has adhd and dislexia
I just want to make a point
:/
I just realized I haven't played a game within the last 24 hours. MUST FIX NAO
how is adhd multitasking?
so I despise these unoriginal, effortless, copy psting comic and encourage people to not support those kind of insult to art.

huzzah, how long is its horn
rarity didn't ask for this
How does wrek know where to put the reflections and whatnot... Gah, i'm an artist myself but i just don't have that kind of brain. So frustrating.
Dken2021: It is but sometimes When ya got so much layers you gotta search to find the layer you want to modify:P
Dken2021: Indeed, but it's gotta get confusing at some point :p
exactly
:)
Malmortius: Its prob by instinct
I just dont have that instinct :( but i want it..
8,6that's why you try to work a single section at a time, get the details done, then move on to the next part
and what feels right :)
I thought left handers are supposed to be naturals xD
Im left handed aswell :D
/me noms on kirzstryfe
Does anypony want a guest pass to Red Orchestra 1 or 2?
I draw portraits but i can't do much else. My mind just.. goes blank

Alright swell

I have 3 for RO2 and 2 for RO1

AAh
it says it gives full access to the game for 3 days
^^
Im okey then :)
If anyone wants one, just PM me. I'll be showerin'
It makes me happy, and depressed watching someone with natural talent like this. To know how to colour, shade..
I wish I could draw like this, but I can only draw on paper, and even then there's only 2 things I've ever drawn I'm completely happy with xD
Oh watching Wreek (dont want to ping him and disturb ^^) draw makes me want to draw
OH Nice
Malmortius: he practiced you know
O.o

Yay! This song!

Baily you can make the mona lisa in one layer :D it just easier with more

XylemTube: Augmented Rarity, like in Deus Ex
THAT WAS NOT COOL MAN!
Rarity never asked for this
^^
08,01otakon: i just made an alias for it
08,01:P
08,01i'll stop
Buytoast: ... I have photoshop and I use paint :D
/me 08,01hugs otakon
eh, i just use photoshop after i draw them out on paper
/me resists shipping urge
Baily , it depends from artist to artist how many layers you use
because i'm a poor lazy ass
Can somepony recormend me a good fanfic which dosn't involve rape or murder?
heheh i wish i could work with layers on paper, it would take less attempts and my paper would not be as dirty
pony36035: My little Dashie.
My Littl;e Dashie
You can read my upcoming one
If it doesnt involve rape or murder then how can it be good?! :(
08,01/)^3^(
pony36035: Anthropology
Captain ponyfag and Randall the Furry Wonder
Caumen: Yeah I know, I tried my hand at drawing a while ago, I didn't have the patience or the skill :(
Also, still think Rarity would look better with more rounded shapes.
dammit lag
Wrek what size on the canvas to you say is good to use for making art like yours?
Buytoast: um what?
Baily , but it doesn't come from day one.
it'll have everything
forced shipping
Allready read My little dashie, so ima go for Anthropology. Thanks :)

Oh yea. Fallout 3 nostalgia <3 even though this wasnt from fallout 3. it was made by the inkspots
I don't want to set the wooorld on fiiiiiiiireeeee
Bronysith: :D
otakon: Are you feeling the nostalgia too?~
cant help it though. just makes me think of fallout 3
Dammit we need some "Kiss to build a dream on" now.
Baily, oh that might turn the motivation down quite a bit.
Nyria: yush.
Baily: There's nothing wrong with that.
otakon: i love fallout 3. but something about new vegas is just more idk kewl
^genius
I love old timey music :)
Bronysith: it's the gameplay I think
Honestly, if feels better in New Vegas
otakon: yea. i like how you can mod weapons and the alt ammo
but I still like the DC wasteland setting better than that WIld West stuff
otakon: but fallout 3 will remain as one of the best games i have ever played
Everlasting_Joy: Yeah I know it just bugs me that I can't relate to anything they draw D:
agreed
http://goo.gl/nLvwV
Baily: Fair enough.
Well... I'm gonna draw with paint :D
G'night everypony.

otakon so you were able to launch Fallout 3 ?
wish I had Morrowind
See ya'll later hopefully.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: decided against it
otakon: it is 10 bucks on steam right now...was 5 bucks
haha
what a change of music
What program does wrek use
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I don't trust minimum settings

otakon: im going to have to play fallout 3 now that i am much more experienced
I can't draw worth crap using SAI. Then again, I have little experience in drawing in general :p

So guys, do you have any tips concerning drawing from imagination
And there's a village by the stream, with stables full of ponies
GODDAMMIT STREAM WORK!
08,01Everlasting_Joy: do the moose pee in it?
You have 500 gold coins, and you must spend them before you set out on your journey
Malmortius: Don't be afraid to erase and try again, whether it be the second, third, or hundreth time.

I'd ask Wrek, but he's too busy :p
I never thought I'd enjoy watching someone draw, but this is really amazing :$
it was on reddit
Try google it :D ?
i was just looking at it
very few derpy comments
so much stream lag =/

Caumen: <3.
08,01Caumen: heeeeeheheheheh
are trench coats important to cyberpunk
there is not a ONE of his cyberponies that doesn't have one.
Bronysith: yes
08,01Unnr: i'll have to try that sometime
Caumen: thanks :D
08,01i'm not a big fan of mountain dew, to be honest
00,10so robtiy?
otakon: just like hats in steam punk?
Sumica: Equinoid
Bronysith: You weren't a man till you wore a hat in the Victorian times xD
right, tim to play portal 2 with my ex while she teases me about a chic iv been talking to
Also strawberry rootbeer works well
this should be interesting
hia
8,6not too many left
Bronysith: dude, the trenchcoat is the STATUS symbol of the cyberpunk genre I think.
11,01Typical, hardcore, casual Wrek.
Hmm, this rarity looks like she would fit in well in Shadowrun
hiya tigher1001
08,01i love r/fifthworldproblems
WE NEED A PROPER SHADOWRUN GAME GODDAMMIT!
08,01"I destroyed a language and intentionally replaced none of its words with the synonymous ones. Everything is all right, I certainly know what to do."

that last Shadowrun game had potential but dammit it was MP Vs. only crap
08,01Unnr: i hope there is a good story behind that
08,01Unnr: thermonuclear handgrenade
otakon: tf2 is multiplayer only
11,01TF2 was made to be MP-only.
Bronysith: yeah but it has more depth than that thimble that is Shadowrun PLUS it was designed SPECIFIACALLY to be MP.
Shadowrun was originally a cyberpunk PnP RPG
i know
tf2 is one of my fav games of all time
bronysmith you are right but there is a single player training mode
that was a awesome idea by the way that they REALLY need to bring back. That and Pallidium RIFTS
Here's a new song :).
such great gameplay. sacrificing realism for...what was it that games are supposed to give you. damn what is that word.. oyea FUN
11,01TF2 has a bot mode as well.
tigher1001: that does not count, it's a goddamn extended tutorial.
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEEE
Shadowrun is a cyberpunk RPG system that mixes cyberpunk with magic. So you get hackers and cyberlimbs and large guns side by side with elves and mages and trolls
whoa, I just noticed Rarity's eyes
tigher1001: my name is Bronysith
Unnr: eeyup
Needless to say, player characters tend to be... well armed
as its also insanely leathal
what i he basing rarity of
AdamTheDuck: eeyup, Wrek's eyes are goddamn beautiful ....well the one's he draws.
tigher1001: it's a cyberpunk Rarity, think Adam Jensen from Deus EX: HR
dammit lag
stop starting
Yeah, the augments have a very Deus Ex vibe to them
00,10ok this time i think it might be a net derp
Why do I have the urge to go out and find a black trench coat with gold embroidery?
net derp?
It's back for me.
I need to get me a badass trench coat and a fedora
The trench coat kinda reminds me of Reynolds from Firefly, if anyone remembers that series :L

Huh, chat really slowed down :o
It's looking great Wrek :3
asura, charr or sylvary can't decide
Ive been on Terraria pretty much all day... when did he start this? :o
She looks amazing Wrek :$
Or start the jacket at least
RaveBrony: a few days ago
I'll say. The stuff Wrek's doing in an hour probably takes me about to week to even learn how to do it.
which wet mane pony will you get? http://derpiboo.ru/52247
8,6well, I tried sylvary and I heard from the last weekend that charr was a little bland, so try asura?

O.o
Nittany_Discord: It is
Nittany_Discord: wasn't deadspace always linear?
Talking about dead Space ... What the hell were they thinking with DS3?

AND the DLC for the MP is free anyway

11,01Hi otakon
Bronysith: dude can't
Bronysith: plus already own it on console
plus crappy videocard can't run it
The free DLC for Mass Effect 3 was nice. Aside the "From Ashes" DLC which was already on the disc. That sucked.

CountDoofus: yh
nice char builder
every single guitarist needs this http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/internet-memes-you-only-need-the-purple-one.jpg
11,01I wonder if this era in gaming will be remembered as good or bad.
11,01Before the next crash.
8,6yeah, gives a few different options to play around with
hmm
doesnt matter
im going to play the games i love
8,6find me as Kirzstryfe when you get in :)
Who is this song by??
brb
Man, look at the number of layers on that thing... Thank goodness for sets :p
yh figures
is this Infected Mushroom?
Goddamn shitty intergrated graphics cards
seriously, ATI HD 4200 is apparently the lowest end since it can't run ANYTHING
goddamn I'm surprised I've got visuals at all on this computer...
Welp gonna try out Cave Story now
11,01I think my 8800 GTS ran Magicka.
knowing my luck it won't run either
11,01About the only game my PC can't run is Metro 2033.
11,01Which I hate.
11,01Even with a video card upgrade, it runs laggy.
Nittany_Discord: I've gone to two different sites that say flat out my video card can't run Magicka.
brb
Nittany_Discord: you got ur gamerhood back on?
Nittany_Discord: I played that for a while, good game IMO but got too hard so I bitched and moaned and turned it off :L
11,01Bronysith: I never stopped gaming.
Nittany_Discord: good
NEVER STOP GAMING
11,01Even greedy publishers can't stop me from gaming. They'll just make it harder, and I won't buy their games.
I love valve so much
11,01AAA games seem to be dropping in quality anyway, so I'm not missing much by boycotting AAA publishers.
Nittany_Discord: y u no on steam?
well yea
most mainstream games are low quality
11,01My gaming PC is broke.
Back :P
just focusing on the graphics
That sucks Nittany_Discord :<
cause most gamers nowadays are "Im not playing ff7 cause it has terrible graphics"
11,01I like good graphics.
11,01I just hate feeling like I'm being ripped off.
11,01And having to play by too many rules to play the game.
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/internet-memes-sassy-ad-lady.jpg
11,01I'm a bad person. I laughed when Issac died after getting his arms cut off by a safety door.
11,01After almost getting sucked out into space.
I'd laugh too.
isaac claarke is related to kenny mccormick
dies in hilarious ways
Unless it happened to a real person. Then I'd be horrfied.
char name is already in use ... i remember this from MMOs lol
11,01Yeah.
but then they respawn CountDoofus ...
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/rage-comics-rage-comics-imaginative-and-proud.png this is me so much
Dead Space is hardly a horror game :D
MadSurge: you can tell they try to make it horror so much
and it failed badly
good game though i think
11,01DS1 was OK. Wasn't really sequel-worthy.
heck yeah, wrek is drawing awesome rarity <3
11,01Ended fairly well.
11,01But EA's gotta have sequels.
11,01And MP.
Nittany_Discord: I agree it was good, once you got past the fact everything laying down stands up :P
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/internet-memes-times-is-hard.jpg
11,01So they can make money off of anti-consumer online passes.
Bronysith: yeah, but jumpscares alone aren't horror :D
exactly
thats why i like amnesia
the dark descent
hi
11,01Amnesia bored me.
11,01Of course, I don't get moved easily by media.
Nittany_Discord: yeah
There are 3 kinds of scary. the doom 3 scary where you open up a closet and a monster goes A BLOOGY WOOGY WOO
11,01Requiem of a Dream was the last movie to move me in any way.
amnesia was pure destillated terror from the very first second
for me
the silent hill scary where you open the closet door and no one is there but you know that there is a monster right behind you that will go a bloogy woogy woo as soon as you turn around but you are too scared to turn around
I don't play any game or watch any movie that's deemed even remotely scary. Not my type of "funf" if you ned to change your underwear by the end of the session.
silent hill 2 that is
fun*
and need*
then there is dead space. which you open a door in a brightly lit room and a monster goes a bloogy woogy woo from 30 feet away
and you have assault rifles and ammunition
Silent Hill is pretty much the ultimate horror game series
silent hill 2 is supposedly really good
CountDoofus I liked amnesia, even though I did nothing... just the pure feel oh horror and sitting in a corner helplessly is somehow awesome for me
/me 11,01runs to closet
they ruined Silent hill 2 HD by taking out the fog
05so far so good
/me pushes Nittany_Discord in closet and locks it with joker gas in it
Bronysith: it's basically Resident Evil 4, an action game with horror themes :D (dead space that is)
really good wrek
Hey everyone
I've seen enough footage of Amnesia to know "HELL NO never playing this!"
Azuredragon: good thing I found a PS2 copy
Wrek: good job man
Haio, Thrackerzod
hi Thrackerzod

LP
And today I learned that HE unfriended ME.

Why cant we just burn down house?
Maybe some controlled demolition
DocSane: He sounds like a real class act.
11,01Is Gigabit a hermaprodite now?
I beleive he unfriended me to protect himself from the cooties I'd obviously developed as a result of liking this show.

d
DocSane: Amen to that.

Maid_Discord: Not according to Alfonz from Johnny Bravo.
Rarity is in another castle

That would be scary as fuck
MaxTheBrony: why are you famous?
Maybe a "Cupcakes" Amnesia mod?
to be honest rarity can handle herself against the diamond dogs
Its applejack and pinky quotes
What would be funny? In the next game if you sing Pinkie's no fear song into the mic you instantly get to the credits.

May I ask why you cant pick up a chair and use it as a weapon?
My name is not Dave.

Why does everyone ask me that
theres a fluttershy as mr. stilts model >_>
Grimdark is awesome! Its just not allowed to discuss Grimdark things like gore and stuff
SpadeMagnes[R]: It would make the game less scary ^^
Buytoast: I'm kidding.
why did you guys choose amnesia?!
DocSane: I'm sorry dave... I can't let you do that
There is A custon mod where a Zombie Fluttershy chases you!
Just mentioning it is fine
Aps: No, I don't know.
cupcakes, don't be too hasty, cupcakes, why are you running away :D?
stephano should be in there XD
Does Rule 34 apply to this game?
my name is Quick_Thinker and i am here to make you really confused
i know you are
Can you guys stop talking about cupcakes
rule 34.2, There are Ponies of it, no exceptions.
