Gold_Demona: magical girl adventures! Yaaaaay~
I only know the name, but nothing else about it.
I typically dont watch these types of anime
This is based on a Clamp manga, isn't it?
Gold_Demona: enope
Odd, looks like it
although that blonde... Was Powerpuff girl Z Bubbles based on her?
Gold_Demona: maybe one of the character designers was
That cat thing sure looks like something out of a Clamp manga
Mutterguy: impossible, this anime came out last year
oh. well then.

Sumica, may I post an average reaction to madoka episode 3?
it's very short
Sumica: what you talking about, broken flowers make me super duper happy!
Bitche need to understand when someone reveals their love for you you can deny it in a better way than saying "I'd rather run off and shoot myself in the head!" Dumb bitch can go rot in the darkness for all I care.
00,10if you wish
http://youtu.be/L1IkPl4RGhM
yeah that fits
I would push her into a pit full of Vashta Nirada without second thoughts.
Grief dealing! So much fun

We are in awe of this anime I guess
Possibly nit the form of blunt trauma but that only to get your attention :D
I'm trying to finish my latest Kerbal masterpiece. So I don't have much to say. :P
Interesting ears on that critter.
Is taht cat talking!?
World's cutest ear hair.
TheRandomkid321 from what i understand it's more a demon
TheRandomkid321: This is anime. Talking cats should not be surprising. Especially in Magical Girl anime
Gold_Demona: it's called Kyuubey btw
The only anime I like is anything with zombies.
My favorite anime is Cowboy Bebop and Black Lagoon
00,10that's not an anime that's soft core TheRandomkid321
Good grief, this series is angsty
Gold_Demona: you've seen nothing yet
this bgm almost sounds like Layton
SPEAKING OF LAYTON
How's that new game?
A friend of mine has the manga of this series. She's told me that this series gets really messed up later...
Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask is gorgeous in the 3ds
dem anime cutscenes in 3d
Gold_Demona: the manga is slightly (VERY slightly) different and there's a ton of spinoffs
HMMMM, magic or miracles you say?
MadSurge, Miracle Mask
oh wow. that's dark
00,10every one loves mustard gas
Well you can say mask of chaos since that's what it's called IN the game

TheRandomkid321, my server isnt going to be reliable and may disapear at any time
Damn...
Phase4 Do you let just anyone go on it or only me and a few others?
i've given someone else the address
Gold_Demona: maybe you should clean up your cookies/temporary internet files
Phase4 Will it come back if it does dissapear?
maybe, maybe not
MadSurge: On BOTH computers?
i got admit i've bben spending a lot of time on the tekkify server
Ah okay.
either way i can send you the save if you want
Gold_Demona: I dunno then
Give me the adress to it then... Despite the fact that I once had it without your permission :$
East coast server?
that appiles to Gold_Demona and MadSurge. I know Phase4 has an east coast server so to speak
I live on the east coast :D

TheRandomkid321, Day Z \:3/
^ pro prgramming skills
AdamTheDuck Hey i'm a sucker for zahmbehz ^_^ and my current Macbook is LITERALLY falling apart.
so is that cat thingy good or evil?
I have no idea as I came in half way through the episode and the stream keeps buffering for me to see the action XD
to see any action*
AdamTheDuck I take it you play Day Z?
TheRandomkid321: keep watching, next episode should answer that
MadSurge it's evil isn't it? WHya re the cute things always evil?
TheRandomkid321, what fun would reading the Zombie Survival guide be without being able to see it in action? \:3/
And cute art :D
D'awwwwwww
Buffered just at the right time
You have a Steam account TheRandomkid321? :3
AdamTheDuck I know but... Doesn't taht game just activate every survival instinc in your body? I've heard it does that and makes you really paranoid if you play it for long periods of time. Especially when it's dark. But hell taht's why I want it so badly. And why I NEED a PC.
AdamTheDUck Yeah.
That cat thingy enver blinks does it?
TheRandomkid321: nope
Blinking is for the weak
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #484

Apparently day Z will be released as a game. Not a free mod.
AdamTheDuck: Dat Fluttershy
TheRandomkid321, eeyup \:3/
AdamTheDuck But wouldn't taht make everyone with the mod want to buy the game?
TheRandomkid321, add meh, Adam The Duck on Steam
AdamTheDUck You add me. I have no intent to bother opening steam right now. it's TheRandomkid321.
TheRandomkid321, I guess, I mean that's how many of my favourite games start out, as simple humble mods.

SO AdamTheDuck. Is the Day Z world as massive as they say it is?
TheRandomkid321, it's ArmA, of course it's huge.
AdamTheDuck So withput a vehicle it takes ages to navigate? And with a vehicle you become a target for bandits?
TheRandomkid321, going on by foot is fun anyway :3
AdamTheDuck Until you die from hinger/thirst.
00,10is this dark and grim, yep
AdamTheDuck: if only humans weren't allowed to shoot each other :|
00,10but it gets more
Sumica: WalMart only sells the basic chocolate and strawberry... But it's better than no pocker at all I guess.
Sumica: sshhhh!!!
pocky*
TheRandomkid321, pfft, there's drinks and water bottles everywhere, and once you find a box of matches, an axe and a hunting knife, you can basically live off the land
AdamTheDuck: Mmm, squirrel.
Apparently there are tents in the game too. What do they even do for you? Sorry i'm asking all these questions :$
00,10beter yet, become zombie. Then live off those liveing off the land
Sumica: braaiiiiiinnssss

AdamTheDuck: yeah, that's the thing! I know there would be lots of bandits and assassins, but as much as I know no other player can be trusted on that mod
Or do what they do in the Walking Dead. Safety zombeh \:3/
00,10tie a zombie up outside your tent as a guarddog?
Nah just cut a zombie's limbs and lower jaw and tie it to your back so you smell like the other zombies

mica james rolfe has ponys on is youtube background
00,10so
JRP :D
i like eeeeeeeeeeee
00,10dont even know who it is
^^^^
Sumica 0_0
YOU dont know
Mica James Rofle? .-.
Sumica: the angry videogame nerd
00,10who/
:D
morning
Mornin' Squallken
00,10dont realy give much of a damn for internet personalitys
how've you been Squallken
Why do these girls have a sixten old rack and an eight year old face? It's kind of disturbing.
ok
happy halloween (or NightMare Night)
p4ngya, I think this is going to be the episode where we found out what Sakura Kyouko wished for.
Kencolt leave it to a 50 year old to point that out XD
Kencolt... Welcome to... Japan? .-.
00,10Clealy Kencolt has not checked out young girls
00,10this is infact comon to the point of being desterbing now a days
Sumica: I have checked out kore girls than you ever dreamed-- but even following anime almost from it's inception, this is a bit wierd in artstyle.
Sumica: its all the hormones in milk now adays, conpiracykeanu.jpg
Kencolt, they actually are about 16 years old, and the large-eye/small-mouth art style is meant to allow the eyes to be more emotionally expressive.
Eyes can display a lot of emotion
00,10both my nieces 12 and 8 have already developed.
8? .-.
00,10yes
girls develop earlier then boys
That thing is evil but a sort of good evil in my eyes. Not evil or cruel just... doesn't really understand... I'm wrong arn't I?
Lass in my old class was developed by 11 with a rather large set of breast
00,10evil by human terms yes
00,10hmmmm btw any one know the rule of 4 in japan?
Not normally to THAT extent. And what I'm saying is, the figures are more along the lines of Sailor Moon, or Evangelion, wher ethe faces more suggest Nanoha or Sakura. Kind of jarring.
Nope
Japan has their own set of rules? :$
00,10more of a stigma then a hard rule
00,10but the number 4 is bad
The characters were designed by the person behind Hidamari Sketch, which is why their heads are wider than they are tall.
i heard this anime had mind blowing weirdness to it, or is mind blowing weirdness and understatment?
Sumica: like how 13 is bad in most western countrys right
an*
00,10in a way yes
00,104 is death
Squallken: You have no idea
00,10where is 13 is bad luck
Squallken, I'd say Mind Blowing Weirdness pretty much sums it up, perhaps.
Oooooh yeah, and something with 7 iirc.
I think my teacher said 7 was sickness
It's been too long since I did Jap ;~;
Sumica: Death in the new Castlevania games always has 4444 HP :D
Some viewers had troube understanding the ending, but I was able to follow it.
00,10and yeah red's back story time
trouble
Kyouko
4 in Japanese is pronounced "Shi"
And "shi" in Japanese means death.
Sumica: isn't there also something about the number 9 also? in japan
00,10could be
SpeccyRush|Drawing, isn't it 7?
AdamTheDuck: and the spirits of death are called shinigami :D
00,10aces and 8's are also bad in western
Although, there's another pronounciation of 4: yon
7 is lucky in the west AdamTheDuck but i'm talking about 9 in the east
00,10she mad
Sumica: except the ace of spades because it's badass :D
ITS POISON!
APPLES ARE RUBBISH
00,10aces and 8's are the deadmans hand
SpeccyRush|Drawing, yeah, 7 in Japanese had 2 pronounciations though
TheRandomkid321, the apple was stolen, and Sayaka didn't want to eat stolen food.
The redhead is Applejack
Sumica: Ah, thye Dead Man's Hand. That's a poker term relatedto a specific historical event, not quite the same thing.
00,10yep
SpeccyRush|Drawing, so if it follows the same idea as 4, it has a negative meaning as well.
Kandarihu But I love thieves. Depending on their morals. Sometimes things considered wrong in society in my eyes are correct.
00,10creepy flashbakc animation
^
Loving this animation though
^
Ok, I canNOT be the only one unable to access this site. It just doesn't make any sense.
I'm back with an English Breakfast
AdamTheDuck: the number 9 in japan sounds similar to the word for pain or distress
No bacon though, bleh
Gold_Demona: maybe it's a zone problem
I'm done with my picture, but I can't post it! T^T
;_______;
I had to chisel into the tin, but didn't take 20 minutes
Gold_Demona: maybe you can ask someone to access your account and post it
Only ended up cutting my hand twice
MadSurge: Hell no.
MadSurge, :/ that's sound like a bad idea considering this is the internet.
that*
00,10so yeah her dad burned down the church and every one in it
Nothing against the friends I make on the internet, but I trust nobody with my personal account info
I know, but not even close friends?
Nobody
Not even my BFF in real life
Tbh yeah, me too
Only person I trust with that info is my husband.
00,10give it a few hours Gold_Demona
Gold_Demona: aww
And the same vice versa
You really are a model couple :3c
Well I gotta go to bed. Cya guys.
Bye TheRandomkid321!
Goodbye TheRandomkid321
Bye TheRandomkid321 :)
HAPPY NIGHTMARE NIGHT YOU SEXY BRONYS!!!!!!!!!! :D
bye TheRandomkid321
:)
00,10I'll take and apple, and eat it
Mmm apple
ill take an apple....AND EAT IT
Damn
hey there
I crunch angrily at you
That is some verocous eating
Why are you guys here
She almost crushed that apple with her bare hands, but not wanting to waste food, she ate it instead.
Sumica: I'm jealous. After I get my dentures, I won't be able to eat an apple like that.
00,10it's never explained why she is always eating
your supposed tobe trick or treating
Sumica: cus she faet
AdamTheDuck aww why?
I'm 15, not the age for that
Sumica: long starving children will eat a lot afterwards
00,10piff
00,10I was trick or treating till I was 22
Never too old eh Sumica?
Plus I live on the dangeroius side of town
00,10yup
Sumica YAAAAA
Sumics knows how to have fun
00,10time is candy
^
I'd still trick or treat, but I have nobody to trick or treat with. :<
:D
Besides
00,10altho now I just buy an extra bag for the house
Gold_Demona :(
You dont get cake in T&t!
"Oh by the way, you know that boy you gave your soul for? I wanna date him"
Why would I freeload, to NOT get cake!
The closest thing to it is I buy candy to hand out to trick or treaters. :P
00,10time for a soul crusher
Kids have to get the candy from somewhere
Gold_Demona scare them
lol
Anyone know the upper monster from Cry of Fear?
00,10they boy she gave up her soul and wish for might be taken away by another girl
That remind me.. have to pick up a bag of candy before this evening.
Put those around youe house, screaming their heads off
/me hugs Gold_Demona the potted plant :$
Well. I gotta run off to school. Later guys thanks for stream as always Mica

god damn :O
o_o
did it get higurashi in here
00,10yep
She's gone slasher movie
I'm scurred now
Hmm SpeccyRush|Drawing, it seems 9 is similar to "pain", can't find anything on 7 though which is strange as my Japanese teacher does speak fluent Japenese >.>
bye AdamTheDuck
00,10oh and what's this ep 8 next
Gold_Demona: wait to see what happens to her
00,10rule of 4
Gold_Demona Good,... good...
SpeccyRush|Drawing, this series isn't nearly as gruesome as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni
Sumica: episode 12 isn't that bad though
So....
What's this show called?
And the cutesy art never stops!
kewl!
And the short skirts and even shorter shorts dont stop
Kandarihu: I'd have a gif in response, but it falls under grimdark ._.
SpeccyRush|Drawing can i see it?
hows the anime Shiki?
meh
:P bye bye
00,10so which girl would be which pony hmmmmm?
HAPPY HALLOWEEN YOU SEXY BRONYS
Gah
My mum is hard work :L
Sumica: Madoka is Fluttershy, Homura is Twilight, redhead is AJ, Sayaka is RD, Mami is Rarity
:D
00,10so pinkie is kuybe?
Yo Phase4
EEEEEEEEEEE
Sumica: well he does have reality warping powers
Gold_Demona: Eek
Gold_Demona, nicely timed
Oh my god ._.

:D
Gold_Demona: I HATE YOU.
00,10makes a few bits even more creepy then
my..god
Kencolt: Awww why? :<
Gold_Demona: *standing ovation*
00,10buhahahaha
Gold_Demona: FOR THE SAKE OF THE RIGHTEOUS AND HOLY!
Ish Sailor Minmus :>
Phase4: Then that classes as spawnkill?
00,10chibi mun
XD
so many stalkers
Gotta cook some minestrone guys, enjoy this episode without me
I figured Chibi Moon worked for Minmus. :D
Hmm, not sure what to play
MadSurge, I don't think comparing Kyouko to Applejack fits. Maybe Pinkamena
I've got this wierd lump on the back of my neck. It's been there months.
00,10Homura cares alot for madoka
Flashbang
grenade?
00,10and then a hint at her power
Ah, the senstitive male.
Yeah, she just killed a couple of pimps
so in this anime Magic Girls become Witchs sooner or later?
its what i think is going on
00,10dead
Squallken, that will be explained at the end
ded
HOLY CRAP What i miss
00,10Houmra just gunned down the cat thing
Squallken, Homura filled Kyuubey full of holes
damn wth is going?
he'll walk it off that cat thing
Did... did he just eat himself?
so the pussy ate itself
idk what going on (crying)
00,10something every guy would try
dem pringles
ive never seen this anime
/me wants Pringles now
inb4 duckface pringles
Me neither Squallken
00,10she became a witch
what a twist
god damn i was right
00,10good catch
NOW, Kyuubey is a villain
this is me so far http://i.imgur.com/WPN1c.jpg
What a movie.
Kiwi
00,10so keep going?
Don't make me chase you with a chainsaw.
in rnuners.
runners*
00,10would like to get to where houmra takes a level in badass
Sumica: will chast minds be able to take whats to come?
*chats
Well I have to shop for candy and sausage. (That sounded funny.) Anyhow, laters.
Two more episodes, and it'll be the last episode before the Sendai Earthquake
/me waves.
cya Kencolt
bye Kencolt
This series feels like someone took a Clamp manga and took it in a REALLY dark direction.
did they forget the witch is still out there
00,10and then he explaines why
hm how far into the season is this episode
00,109 of 13
thanks
Oh, all of those chairs supposedly evokes another series called Bokurano which is also about a group of children getting a horrible raw deal.
Bah, I phrased it wrong.
so the alien cat is saying, human = food?
00,10human = energy
back in my day we played battle field 1942, on a real battlefield
00,10to fuel the uneverse
"Oh, that is despicable. (lol) I LOVE IT"
Paspiedreamcast: indeed
so I can log this channel off now and use my Paspie user exclusively
Sumica: That. That is the plot twist that got me the most
I have an idea there this is going, and im going to love it :D
00,10you could have also asked
i get that feeling
she eats a lot :/
Kyouko gave Madoka a snack that she actually paid for figuring that Madoka would have the same aversion to stolen food.
Never tell lies, only half truths
but half truths are worse than lies
D:
My mac just exploded. o_o
<.<
Defnie 'exploded'
Define*
im sorry to hear that Gold_Demona
*exploded
*define
Gold_Demona: O_o
also, meow
Jmo: Suddenly white screen of not responding.
D:
white screen of death?
because apple just has to be different
00,10cool boss zone
It's not like the blue screen of death because there's no text or anything. Just a big blank white screen.
This series was described as being to Magical Girl series what Evangelion is to Super Robot series. I'd say this series does a better job of deconstructing it's respective genre than Evangelion did.
^
so, gold_demona_, its 'the white screen of should have bought a PC'?
Kandarihu how would you say that
00,10well this show did't run out of vudget in the end either
Roseluck`: I have a pc, thank you very much
Kandarihu: a better deconstruction of that genre is Bokurano. Same writer, incidentally
Roseluck`: And in the four years I've had both of these computers, this is the ONLY time the mac has done this.
The deconstructive part of Evangelion centered around pretty much the only protagonist of ANY mecha series who didn't want to pilot the mecha (yes, I know it's a cyborg kaiju).
Whereas I've had to replace Windows on this PC more than once.
gold_demona_: so did you follow the space plot twist?
00,10wtfboooooom
What space plot twist? The one where the cat's an alien and the Magical Girls are a plot to fuel the universe?
bounce like my checks did, back in the day
And yeah, they're both dead
gold_demona_: yep
And this protagnoist just rubbed fans all kinds of bad ways with his spinelessness. Madoka, on the other hand, wants to become a magical girl but is stopped by someone who cares about her long enough for the details to give her pause
MadSurge: Yup, I got it. :P
have to go to shops back soon
Yeah, I'd have to say Madoka is a WAY better protagonist than Shinji.
^
isnt she though?
Though that's not a difficult feat. Being a better protagonist than Shinji
just saying
This is gonna be a bit hard to follow.
And come the biggest plot twist of the anime
Uguuuu~
Guys what do you think is cuter, Derpy smiling with her eyes open or smiling with her eyes closed? its a side view so you can't see her walleyedness
SpeccyRush|Drawing: how about half closed?!
ya just have to make it harder for me don't ya MadSurge
ya.
Then open
SpeccyRush|Drawing: Depedns on what she's smiling about
Depends*
gold_demona_: lets say she's listening to a story from a friend
Then eyes open
If this series aired during Prime Time, the sponsors would be very upset over the fact that Madoka hasn't been seen as a Magical Girl until now
...and my flash is crashing
NM.
00,10kinda an odd role reversal
Flash forward to Walpurgis Night
bbl
Hey everypony
Kandarihu, i thought you said "my fetish is crashing"
i was like WTF M8
Roseluck`, lol
gold_demona_: now what if I said its lyra telling the story
SpeccyRush|Drawing: I'd say it'd depend on the story more than who's telling it..
00,10figure it out yet?
gold_demona_: existence of humans story
SpeccyRush|Drawing: Probably eyes closed them
then*
Awwww
She probably used her magic to heal her heart as soon as she woke up in the hospital.
00,10yep she tossed a bomb........there
not sure if fan service or not
To be clear, Homura's powers have nothing to do with fighting, but only lets her bend time and hold stuff in her giant timer. So she fills it with conventional weapons.
probably fan service
So she can steal all weapons and bombs she likes and hide them in a pocket dimension
00,10she also has malletspace
It's only fanservice for those who passionately love guns.
00,10so yeah they are now showing all her time loops
not all
sumica, this is my favorite episode
BETRAYAL
sad face
SAD FACE!
00,10realy glad they did not have the gun shot
i watched this series originally with a socially awkward man in my AIT platoon
Dat pissed/sad face
Now she's serious
00,10alll the dakka
she kills EVERYTHIGN
little girl with big guns
walpurgis night
00,10and then we have ep1
the music for this is amazing
^
nd the action tht goes with it is just as good
such a creep creature
So yeah, Madoka is the protagonist, but Homura is the herp
*heroine
gold_demona_: just casue i'm super critical of myself here http://i.imgur.com/QINBO.png you know what they say a picture speaks more than words...
what a dick :3
how hard is it to fight in high heels
00,10queue terminator theme
Hm... I think the eyes open one is better.
if you live long enough, even your greatest heros become villans
UGH! Nuuuuu My mac! It's dying! D;
00,10oh and yeah, whole ep is over and now opening theme
IKR!
magical quartet?
00,10glad they did that
00,10cause the opening would have spoiled that ep
she has a kitty cat
and i wub it
and i want it
and im about to be kicked for overflow
... or not.
00,10it's all her falt they want madoka so badly
OP?
op
And at the ending will it say "ED"? :D
00,10I wonder the importants of the salt on the sholder
Isn't salt supposed to repel evil or something?
Or bad luck?
00,10probably somthing to do with her coming back from a wake
both technically
Throwing salt over your shoulder is supposed to be good luck I think
00,10yeah but her mom sprinkeld some on madokas sholder as she came home
It's a western custom, so if it's based on that it might be a misinterpretation
if
00,10they have been intefearing for decades
Sumica: Kiyome-shio: after the funeral, before entering the house, each person throws salt behind them to ward off evil spirits; some place a large amount of salt at the entrance of their houses and step on it before entering.
Sumica: http://www.worldclass.net/TeachingGlobally/WorldReligions/shinto_funerals.htm
00,10oh look, suns comeing up
It's it's a Shinto thing. My bad
Oh it's*
It's not like they can't be translated.
DocSane: What do you mean?
00,10he dont like the honorifics
00,10here we go.
Sumica: Those don't really have proper translations. Only rough equivalents that sound retarded. =/
The honorifics I mean
My stance on honorifcs has softened over the years.
00,10level in badass inbound
But I hate, hate, HATE fan translators that leave terms like "onii-chan" and "yatta" in Japanese.
...this is all going over my head right now
00,10as I pray.......
DocSane: Yeah, that's kind of annoying.
00,10yes she keeps all that in her pocket
So, who was the Walpurgis Night before she became a witch?
DocSane: it's an amalgama of witches
Sumica: talk about hammerspace
Oh btw NO SELL
MadSurge: Ah, okay. I was never clear on that point.
A friend of mine hates this show.
oh and gold_demona_ thanks for ze input
o.o, what show is this?
No problem SpeccyRush|Drawing
She hates all things "girly", hates magical girl shows, and HATES how this story went.
DocSane: does he like giant robots?
MadSurge: She. No, not particularly. Likes space opera mostly, like Space Battleship Yamato.
oh thx MadSurge
Good night gentlemen.
night XAX
00,10piffff, yamato, a space opera
DocSane: because Bokurano is the equivalent of this show for giant robots
Night XAX
Sumica: How is Yamato not a space opera?
00,10it's an action show in space.
00,10it's world building is lacking
Sumica: Um... that's the DEFINTION of Space Opera.
Sumica: Um... Its world-building is top notch.
00,10it's not a bad show but it's not close to space opera
Sumica: It's probably THE definitive anime space opera.
00,10right
How much Yamato have you seen?
00,10also odd that's the end of the video
Sumica: You are mistaken. It IS Space Opera. It's up there in the genre with the original Lensman Novels and the SKylark series.
before i go on with my day I have this to say about this anime
00,10and yeah, tired
Harvey Dent was right
Aww, end of stream
Nighty Sumica :(
You either die young or live long enough to see yourself the villain?
Sumica, thanks for streaming
dem sea ponies :3
Goodnight Sumica! :) thanks for the stream
inb4 chat gets very quiet
gold_demona_: there's only one episode left, wanna me to spoil it?
@ DocSane YES
00,10will finish madoka soon
Thanks, Sumica. We'll discuss this later.
MadSurge: Sure
thank you Sumica
Night Sumi. Sweet dreams

he must have it pre copyed
ASoftFluffyThing: ...touche'
im guessing theres nothing playing today since the video wont load up
Sylandest, indeed.
MisterSkids: At the moment, no one is streaming. so its a quiet time, hehe. But feel free to stay and chat at your leisrue
*leisure
/me shakes ASoftFluffyThing's hoof/paw/fluff
ill probaly do that, my fav chat is slow today (that being celetia radio)
iv delvid pretty deep so far into the brony community, and my favorite so far is the docter whooves adventures
MisterSkids: I've seen a few of them, its one I'd like to revisit though. Been a little while since I last saw them...
i love both piercesmolders and PIAB styles
in fact, i kinda sent an audition to PIAB for voice acting and writing
Sup suckas?
...
howdy
Uh...
howdy Hoody|Skool :)
Sup, Hoody|Skool
you sent an audition, you say, MisterSkids?
I know its halloween, but that doesn't mean it has to be so dead...
Hai Hoody|Skool :D
yo
yes i did 2 really one just of the voices i could do and the other was a very serious speech that many people have told me was amazing
Hoody|Skool, people are at work and school at the moment. All the Halloween parties were held this past weekend
:D
b/c of sandy
._.
umm Sylandest if u want to, i put the video of my auditions on youtube, i dont think there super amazing but ummm....yea
MisterSkids: I'll have a look around :)
Gonna get this mask taken...
kk let me get a link
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvDjO-_YaQM
Yawn
Moo
No Ayejay
hrm
hallo everypony
i wrote this and voiced it
Sup sucka?
Yo
/me sigh
o.o
LightTrooper105: You did this
i did wut? o3o
I don't even know anymore...
i pity you..
MisterSkids: After listening to it, I would say you've got some potential there. Your tone is good, as is your range of sound. My only suggestion, if you do another, is to watch your clarity. A couple words were a bit muffled, but aside from that, good job :)
Don't pity You, he can't help it
thx, part of the problem is my CNY accent and another my mic is total and utter crap
im glad u like it
MisterSkids nice
MisterSkids: no worries, it was well done! :)
Thx, im still waiting for a responce but everypony i ask says its good
it is good
and Sylandest im glad u gave also some helpful critsism thats what i like, ways to improve
MisterSkids: anytime :)
i tryed an angry raw approach with it first but i didnt like it so itryed a slower sadder approach...bingo
MisterSkids: Aye. The tempo of a speech, as well as the emotion applied to it, can affect the overall performance. You have to get just the right balance to get the effect you desire. Learned that in my Communications course here at Uni.
oh and a...my other videos r of me and my buddys being idiots lol
hehehe
thats it too, just the right emotion for the job, with the right accent and flow of words
Unfortunately, I have to head out for a tiny bit. Moving from dorm to classroom. Be back in a little bit, everypony
kk see ya in a bit
hey guys
Hai again alexxm
ohhai
Hey alexxm
/me pokes ASoftFluffyThing

teehee iv been writing a kool idea i had for Docter WHooves if anypony wants to hear the plot
:v
:^
also i heard that trixies might be coming back in season 3,
i heard that too
im actuelly excited about that, i wonder if she changed a bit, i feel like she went and started studing magic like twilight all the time
also im very talkive because i had alot of caffiene lol
happy nightmare night bronies!
hmmm? well thats just my theory is all
too u to pony_3290
what is the worst shipping you can think of?
MisterSkids: its just that any discussion on season 3 (even if you were not intending it to be) will result in a ban from chat right now
how long will that ban be?
perma
ooooooooooooooooooooo
woah thats kinda harsh, understandable if things get out of hand but WOW that HARSH
/me zips lips with real zipper
SpeccyRush|Drawing: I'm quite sure it's not perma
albeit i said perma i believe you can send an appeal for said ban
but it won't run out with time
do you get reply with ban appeal?
ask someone who's been banned or ask a mod if you decide to make them self known in chat at the time
*if they decide to make themselves known

Kawaii_icybeauti: you are safe and sound, I would hope? MisterSkids as well?
yea the storm barely even touched us
in fact my and my buddys flew a 40 foot long tarp in the 50mph winds
Sylandest: My street was the only one to still have power in my neighborhood, and my dad has to bring my grandma from new jersey. The only thing to affect me is halloween is on saturday...:(
MisterSkids: fun times! :D
Kawaii_icybeauti: I see...I'm sorry you have to wait. But its good that you're safe though! Thats whats most important! :)
im still sore from it
08,01TIL there exists such a thing as horse glitter.
the wind well drag u across the fields when its that strong
08,01i'm not even making that shit up
what the hell is horse glitter
Hi everybody :) I is back
ohhia
Horse glitter???
Kawaii_icybeauti: We worry mostly about your well being, we're happy to know you're fine :)
do i even WANT to know wat horse glitter is?
MadSurge: Thankies :3 I have the day off again today, and I've never seen my school cancel more than a day at a time. We had 3 DAYS OFF.
Horse glitter is glitter shaped in horses :D
inb4 we find out anyway
08,01it's glitter, right
08,01and, this will blow your mind
IT DEFINETLY NEEDS MORE GLITTER!!
08,01it's glitter that
08,01make yourself ready for this
08,01you put it
08,01on your horse.
On the mane?
Pfft
>_>
MadSurge: The thin made it all the way up to new york.
thing*
08,01MadSurge: "apply liberally as required"
cant u just take normal body glitter for something as stupid as that, why make a thing as horse glitter?
Kawaii_icybeauti: yeah, that's a pretty good motive to cancel school I mean
MadSurge: Yeah. My mom said the traffic lights weren't working when she tok my brother to the gym, maybe I'll get the day off again.....god knows.
08,01MadSurge: can't; working
helllllllo
Eeepp...I can't watch scary movies...
08,01just got back from school
Ahhh it's fine then :)
08,01i taught the 5th years (16/17 year olds) how to fork bomb a linux machine
08,01now *that* got them interested in getting a Raspberry Pi
That sounds rad!
that sounds ummm....i have no idea how that sounds
I just see the word "bomb" I think it might be cool
/me 08,01has a feeling that he's doing more to drive the uptake of learning programming and computer science in that school than anything else has done in a long time
Kawaii_icybeauti: one good thing of living in europe, no monstruous perturbations coming your way
13that feel when you wake up wondering why your legs are chalk white and so smooth.. then i realize i was so tired yesterday i crashed out without taking tights off
08,01Shizuka: yes
Shizuka: :D
That happens to me all the time
08,01tights are warm
08,01i'm actually wearing tights right now
08,01because goddamn, it's cold in scotland
Europeans....
/me 08,01isn't even joking
If you got caught wearing tights in my town without being a girl....
I have no thighs, but I had to put on shoes today because my feet were freezing and slippers weren't enough
13you have no thighs!
I used to wear Tightrs on extremly col√∂d days too...
Shizuka: OH NO! *tumbles down*
13morning bronystate crowd is more fashionable :3
o.o
Morning Shizu :)
08,01my tights are boring black ones
I remember the way my mom would bundle me up on the typical NY winter days....Tights, then 2 pairs of socks, 2 pairs of pants...like 1000 shirts, jacket, boots, gloves, scarf...I was ready for venturing in the artic...
im 45% scottish :)
and hi evryone :)
/me 08,01should get some bright pink tights
everyone*
Shizuka: I've been here for night and morn so I guess I'm the exception :P
I haven't worn tights since I was a kid
13i've always been partial to white
HAHA Kawaii, i live on the edge of the adirondacks, alot of us just walk around in shorts in the winter
ASoftFluffyThing: I would wear them when I was still dancing, but sinc eI wuit that, no more tights unless it's cold and I'm wearing a dress/skirt,
/me wears almost only jeans
no joke
I wear leggings but not tights
13tights let you extend shorts season by like three weeks
My mom is from a tropical country, she didn't know what winter was, so she would kill us with clothing
Shizuka !! :O http://i.imgur.com/3RF2V.gif ...I kid
what to do first? Staying in Bronystate and Listening to Tuesday Tech Talk, or watching the new VGA Episodes >.<
i wear kahkis most of the time during the colder seasons
13SpeccyRush|Drawing: hey black is okay but doesn't usually go with my outfits
and the warm seasons
Because I'm older and because of global warming, I go in jeans mostly, maybe a skirt and leggings every now and then.
13i wear black jackets if it makes it less raaaaaaaacist
dam i love kahkis
Shizuka: you like more colourful clothes?
Shizuka: but black is supposed to go with everything
New York=Black clothing. Even as a small child I wore black. it's like a funeral everyday...
oh oh Shizuka http://imgur.com/gallery/POde6 you may have seen it though
13MadSurge: not in winter... usually blues and blacks
13i have some dimmer reds for summer but i'm pretty boring .-.
13is why white goes better
08,01Shizuka: pics or i call shenanigans.
13nu .-.
/me 08,01runs
XD
08,01i'll take some pics of my tights when i actually get up and turn the light on
/me 08,01has a bad cold, and feel horrible
13pff light
13who needs it
08,01i do! i love light!
Like 90% of my closet is black. Plus the dark blues for denim, and only a bit of my closet actually invovles color, mostly my cheerleading clothing.
now if I ever were to wear white in winter, specifically after a snow... all you'd see is a tuft of hair floating around...
im writing atm soo im in and out of the conversation
08,01i'm a cross between a plant and a cat
/me 13sneezes at bright light .-.
/me is very pale
08,01i like light, warm places
I somehow keep choosing tshirts with black "background" o__o
can WAIT till it snows, i love the winter season
08,01MisterSkids: blargh, i hate the snow
MisterSkids: It didn't snow anythign last year for me, I hope we get some.
08,01the snow can suck my icicle.
where is Wrek?
oh my~
i know, me and my buddys went all the way to BLue Mountain to go sledding down it
13http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/10/netherlands-highways-will-glow-in-the-dark-starting-in-mid-2013 oo neat
Shizuka: That's so aweosme!!
That's neat AND useful
didnt know till like 5th of januuary
The only time is snowed in souther NY was on halloween...
it*
Shizuka: Aww, I wish we had that too.
That looks neat.
nvm
Because we're herps...
herp derp
13then we can have the cool things
huh. glow in the dark roads
They're in the middle of the freedom tower right now, any updates will take forever...
thats our tranportation system, always doing alot nothing all the time
This february it snowed so hard I couldn't go anywhere. Then I realized there was that stream site for ponies and I came here :$
:) good choice
It was actually warm as hell in feburary....We got some may 0 degree days..:O
50*
Kawaii_icybeauti: never seen that much snow around here, even when I was a kid
Shizuka: how else we gona get rid of that 8% ?
Fix all da roads.
MadSurge: There's usually a blizzard or 2 during the winter...Nothing this year though....
worst winter EVER last year 50 degrees nearly made my head explode
Not yet at least :D
i love sledding, skiing, cross country skiing building snow sculptures
extreme sledding
MisterSkids: http://www.macdesktops.net/data/506/31207sled1024-med.gif

Voicemail? Who uses voicemail these days?
Shizuka: Yes, it said "Hello, if you're not dead, please answer, if you are infact dead, feel free to ignore me and not answer...wait, you are doing"
Kammerjunk: I use a pager.

A blood pager?
I like to mess with people and make my voicemail go "hello... why did you phone... Ah I see etc"

RealMisterSkids: oh, you did?
MadSurge, in Minecraft silly

ASoftFluffyThing: oh sorry :D
13i hate comcast
13so much
13can't even begin to describe how much i hate comcast
sorry for being so idle, I'm just at school
RealMisterSkids: I found it, viewing now :)
kk
btw how does one copy anothers name so fast
Shizuka well dont mind that, join us and have some candy! :)
13i can't
13my connection sucks today
And on Halloween with the TF2 stuff tonight of all days
RealMisterSkids: use the tab button to autocomplete a name. Try mine. Type Syl, then hit the tab button
Sylandest: kool
very nice idea for a chat room
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Spotlight Music: Fears / Flaedr - Nighttime Queen / K3WRO - Hivemind
oh cool i can use my name again brb
Sylmare?
Panda: I got hit by a r63 beam~
Shizuka not even for a Twix?
Shizuka, surely there is another ISP in your area ^^
13Panda: nope, it's comcast, satellite for twice the price and half the speed, or dialup
13we pay $75 a month for 12/4 with comcast, and this year we've had maybe 80% uptime
oh damn... wait...what about your cell phone Shizuka?
13can't tether
:/ how come?
im bak
13costs too much
13for three lines with unlimited data it'll be $150 a month
13and that was the best offer
Eh? I can tether for free. Geez what cell phone company do you have? O-o
13t-mobile
its ok
bfbrb (back from brb (back from be right back))
It wasnt possible for me to go on the internet while I was in school :P
13not to mention that the "unlimited" is really "4G speed up to 2GB, then 2G speed after that" which means we may as well be on dialup if we tethered
unless I had the computer infront of me..
What the hell? they are ripping you off. I have tmobile and 2 lines and it doesnt cost NEARLY that much.
Mmm...s'pose I should get some wool
13company lobbies government to keep everyone else out, gets to drive prices through the roof
Sounds about right.
/me pokes ASoftFluffyThing
Wooool~
So t-mobile actually charges people to teather their phones?
ASoftFluffyThing can you find anything other than pigs and cows that usually happens for me :P
Jmo, YOU BROK DA WOOLS
:3
I just rooted my phone and tethered that way >.>
pot80, it depends on which biome you're in.
It's mah dye.
I do wut I want :>
Sheep are just about everywhere except for deserts.
whenever i need food all I get is sheep and whenever I need wool I get pigs and cows XD
pot80 uh... are you playing harvest moon or something?
nope I'm a newb to the game and I had no idea what I was doing at the time :P
13it's a separate plan anyway
/me hasn't played Harvest Moon in years
Maid_Major, play the recent ones O_O they are so good...
No stream yet :(
ohai dere Pony Folk
Pony Folk?
:(
Hayo

Wear all pumpkins.
Hai there IshFrankenPony :3
i improved shock tops background story and i feel happier about it
/me eats all teh pumpkins
Hiya
Hai RainbowAsh
how are things RainbowAsh
Back Story: Theres a reason hes called Shock Top. Tortured when he was by other's for his strange behavior. And just one prank too many, and Shock just finally snapped. Using a using some a small hand buzzer and a water pistol, we was able to get back at the little children by assualting them with electricty. And it was after that day that that he, Shock Top and created many more unique weapons, ranging from melee to chemical.
hallo RainbowAsh

Hi Brovakiin|Assassin and pot80 *hugs*
BronyState is funny when there's no stream.
Mostly because people are desperate for one
Cave base isn't too far from land base. Awesome
13http://cdn.cinemagr.am/cine_1/20591143.gif
Oh, dogs. You so silly.
Shizuka picture anime-esque whooshing sounds with that XD
Shizuka, she stares into my soul
pretty sure that gif is edited
twilight_sprinkle ^^ it is
/me noms twilight_sprinkle
Panda, you can tell because of the pixels
doggie
Panda: one day i'll nom you before you do :P
/me throws a raisin at Panda.
Shizuka: I am scared now
/me nomz Panda nonetheless :3
Happy Nightmare Night everyone!
Hai Sundaysmile :3
We don't celebrate in my family, but happy Nightmare Night regardles.
regardless*
don't celebrate it*
Sundaysmile, Nightmare Night, what a fright, give me something sweet to bite!
Trick or treat! :)
:)
He really is underrated.
/me gives RainbowAsh a toffee Apple
/me give Kammerjunk nothing
crap i gtg to work soon, hopefully its outside work than i can work on my fan fic as i write
ohokay
What's really annoying is that kids in my neighbourhood still celebrate it.
no wait as i walk i ment not write lol
I thought they'd have learned by now.
/me gives Maid_Mayor smores
Who wants to have a chatventure?
best thing is scaring little kids with tricks not treats
chatventure Barb|SoMuchBLOOD
?
as long as your not turning tricks :P
RainbowAsh: You were quoting his Nightmare Night ._.
Maybe. I don't know. I don't follow a lot of brony musicians, and the ones I do are underrated.
Chatventure sounds dangerously like rp
and rp isnt allowed
Kammerjunk, I was quoting the series Oo
There's a series?
Its something I just came up with. Its like "Pick a page" type story book, but in a chat room, with like 1 or 2 people providing the choices
oh no nothing like that lol, masks hiding in bushes that sort of thing....that doesnt help my case does it
If you guys want too I need a volunteer to help me
Will there be blood?
Might have to do that this evening though, so make sure you can be on.
:P
Kammerjunk, it's what the fillies shout in Luna Eclipsed
Jmo no. The blood is all gone.
Damn.
It will be a ghost story for sure. =0
Also did a 20 minute progessive rock song about the-fic-that-shall-not-be-named.
sry i gotta work till 10 Barb|SoMuchBLOOD and after that go to a resutrunt
It will be fun.
Aw. =9
My keyboard is dieing
lol
I can't be bothered to find batteries.
rub it against a wooly sweater, static electricity will do
Lithium-ion batteries are best batteries.
Barb|SoMuchBLOOD, dying*
people still use wireless keyboards?
but they are so slow
No memory effect is the best.
Anyways. I will make up a story for tonight. I have one question, do you guys want it to be about ponies or no?
is there a stream?
I can't be bothered to check my spelling and grammer either ASoftFluffyThing
Barb|SoMuchBLOOD it wont be in here or youll get the wrath of mods
I can make a room.
And I dunno why. Its not like I would do it during a stream.
advertising other rooms is against rules
Cuase you know, I would want to watch the streams
what stories?
thing is people tend to go overboard in rp
no matter how you try to stop them
The back seat modding is so strong in this chat room. Fine buzz kill.
Chrysalis, did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed bro
Jmo not really, i just cannot stand rp
RP in itself is allowed, but yeah, excessive amounts of it isn't allowed and it does have a tendency to go overboard.
tom is best mod
Kammerjunk, nice vocals
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 9 days, 20 hours, 34 minutes, 6 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
SOON.
Thanks tom!
Nine days.
Not soon enough
NINE. DAYS.
nine days until the chat becomes FLOODED with ponyfolks
I can't wait to observe the Mane 6 rooms from the comfort of regulars.
nine days until technical difficulties :P
9 days until best birthday gift evar ^_^
BladedWings: Your birthday is on the S3 release date?
Sundaysmile: ^
Kammerjunk: the season 3 release date is on my birthday lol...i was born to watch ponies :D
Yup.
BladedWings: That is awesome.
...I facepalmed.
VenHur: i knew about 7 but 8 and 9!?
BladedWings: Disney said they were planning to have a Star Wars film produced every 2-3 years.
That's means we had to suffer from more Jar Jar Blinks...
^
I can only hope for it taking place in the Old Republic.
Kammerjunk: oh dear sweet luna -_(\
What I wanna know is who is going to be acting Luke, Leia and Han Solo.
Kammerjunk, don't give them ideas to make time travel canon
:<
Hey, if there's going to be a new Star Wars film, I want to see the Jedi Wars.
Jedi Civil War*
I think Episode VII, VIII, and IX are the sequel trillogy, and I don't know much of the Star Wars universe...
I want some Revan and Malak up in these films.
Well they've already stated they'll do another three involving the cast from Star Wars IV onwards no?
Eh. I would not see a chatventure as an rp, but I can see how it would turn into that very easily.
sorry not the cast
the characters
And that would be against the rules fo sho.
Sundaysmile: Then I'll be glad to see Ewan McGregor again.
Besides the characters, the Lightsabers, the Death Star, and...Jar Jar Blinks... *facepalm*
I doubt I could come up with anything really interesting anyways.
AT LEAST THE SEQUEL TRILLOGY BETTER BE AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINALS! :[
I dunno, I like McGregor. I just think he had a case of bad writing.
but isn't everyone in the original films old
It's very rare that a sequel tops the original these days
i was gone there what is happening all of the sudden?
and disney's sequels don't seem to make the cut...
Sundaysmile: That's because nostalgia is a cruel mistress.
@__@
Netsplit?
indeed
Well, to be fair, after SWTOR, it's an act of mercy to put the franchise out of its misery
looks like it..
I kind of want to play KoTOR now.
though it could've been worse... it could've been bought by 4kids entertainment or something
http://7.asset.soup.io/asset/3851/6887_c1e9.jpeg
Oh lol
LOL
INB4 Mickey Mouse is main character in Star Wars VII.
Does this work?
though to be honest I've not been the biggest fan of the marvel shows they've produced lately
?
Just checking if I was actually connected
I got disconnected like 3 times already
Was there a netsplit?
Kammerjunk for now
Whats wierd is ive yet to have tne netsplit get to me
theyll change it once the fanboys stop crying
that's odd
darth mickey
when I first signed in it was just the two SRs and my other computer
I'm surprised they haven't taken a cue from EA. If it doesn't hurt income, it's probably fine.
Guys. Calm down about the acqusion....sorry for the typo, but really, chill phils.
Hey, I'm just sayin'. I'm sure Star Wars VII will be at least as good as the prequels.
I connected directly to charizard and it seems to have stopped, so maybe it's just a shaymin problem?
Kammerjunk, you're right, it's good to manage your expectations
Dat SB.
/me glomps Kammerjunk
11,02Moo o.o
Moo indeed, good sir.
11,02Happy Nightmare Night ^-^
woot
oh, nightmare night is today?
Aloa Everyone :)
Moo NewSpookyBronyU :3
11,02I've been a good pony so the Great Pumpkin is going to give me presents tonight :D
http://e.asset.soup.io/asset/3851/6126_7c53_500.jpeg
Inb4 kidnapping and candy ransom
Billion.
NewSpookyBronyU: an early WiiU? :D
11,024 million? lol
RainbowAsh: o u
11,02MadSurge: Dat would be cool ;3;
NewSpookyBronyU Will you go for a Trick or Treat round in your neighbourhood?
I hear it was in the billions
11,02VenHur: Yesh, I heard about it :3 They're coming out with Episode 7 in 2015
VenHur: no...it was 3 billion..
NewSpookyBronyU: And Episode VIII and IX.
Nope, 4.1.
Rougly.
11,02ekips: Maybeh o.o However, I might be staying home to give out candy. We're expecting 600 kids to visit our house this year.
Oh wow.
4.1a and one half
Inb4 episode 7 is WAY better than the second trilogy anyway :D
NewSpookyBronyU: So be prepared for more Jar Jar Blinks and "NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!".
inb4 massed fan rage after release :P
600 kids? Usually, noone visits my home for trick or treat
Well, it's not done yet, so so far, it as good as the prequels.
11,02Jar Jar Binks is Disney's favorite character because he's the comic relief :D
Pfft, yeah right...
INB4 Jar Jar Binks as main character.
^ FUCK NO!
ANYTHING BUT NOT THAT!
NewSpookyBronyU: I guess there must not be any Trunk or Treat things around you. Around me all the church trunk or treats steal all the trick or treaters and no one goes door to door anymore. Haven't had a single one in four years
Well, I'm going to go eat whatchamacallits.
Kammerjunk: :D that would be a suicude
Fritters? I think they're called fritters.
*suicide
You know, the ones you shower in jam and icing sugar.

I used to have a computer that because it had a horrible wireless adapter, it would ping timeout regularly.
I didn't mean to literally call you guys
Just me and Ayejay having a talk.
In the future, Justin Biber and Rebbeca Blac k are married...and they're kid...SINGS WORSE!
Y'know
Fluttershyfan158: dat ending
AHHHHh
Am I the only pony who loves Grimdark?
but I still wub you both ;3
:3
Reminds me of my family's old Vista desktop
AJIsAwesome: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23kdeh06G18 no
i dont mind it, i think its funny
VenHur: :'( that made even fluttershy cry
^^
i have no idea wat that is Fluttershyfan158
loljks I wub no-one.
:>
/me twitches
vinyl stull wubs u
that thing had so many wireless problems even though the router was only a room away
MisterSkids: then you dont want to know! :D
...Oh, don't worry...I had MORE to tell... HA HAH HA HA HA HAH HAAA!
Grimdark: Cupcakes, Rainbow Factory, and a series of scary pony stuff..
...So...who likes to hear them?
Fluttershyfan158: i have nothing against grimdark, it just doesn't fit ponies one bit
i seen both raonbow factory and cupcakes to my horrow
I luv cupcakes..
Fluttershyfan158 Just be careful bringing that up. Kinda is poking the rules by bringing it up here in mane chat
...so apparently I got 100% on that paper I was complaining about a couple weeks ago
I has licorice :3
Oh..nv
Fluttershyfan158: have you heard micthemicrophone read them? its hilarious
nevermind
I heard that Mic The Microphone is a jerk..
I'm pretty sure it was nowhere near that good because I just wrote it at the last minute and didn't care...
At one point I had both the computer with crappy wireless, and a computer with much better wireless running at the same time and connected to the same IRC network, and I would get ping timeouts with the one while the other would still be working fine.
and why did he have to go and name it cupcakes, i thnk he was making sure EVERYBODY remeber that dammed movie
movie...?
its a...youtube video now
ODNT WATCH IT
dont*
dont watch what?
MisterSkids: they should show it for halloween :3
I had a scary story...in the future...Jar Jar Blinks is the main character...IN ALL OF STAR WARS, BECAUSE LUKE SKYWALKER DIED FOR NO SUDDEN REASON!
Mwa ha ha ha ha haaa!
Snow Cupcakes
I don't like Cumcakes and Ronbow Factory :(
meh
pfft, watched it long ago, i was STILL laughing, micthemicrophone made it that way.....
not that bad...
VenHur: yeah, he was planed to be in the remake
guys, there is comming a star wars episode 7 in 2015
Eli: But they didn't, right?
artist: And 8 and 9.
i listened to micthemicrophone read a story about RD falling in love with a sink, so DAM funny
probably
computer problems..back..
artist: really?
hi all
i dont see what's so bad about cupcakes, its just a fic.
Hey
Hi!
MisterSkids: i found that one highly disturbing, i find most of his stories HIGHLY DISTURBING
its a youtube video now and quite horrorifing
artist: well now Georgy just wants our money. he said he would never make the last 3 parts...
I haz another Scary Story: Spike will eventually leave Twilight when he grows up..
Eli: he sold it
no worse
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: The Great and Powerful Trixie Presents: The Gameloft Game
he will eat her.
lol @ random resume emails in my inbox..
Fluttershyfan158: if Twilight doesn't die first :|
Fluttershyfan158: shut up! it will never happen!
Bronystate planning on streaming anything spookeh tonight?

What was the post about?
Panda: im currently working on a costume atm, also known as a fursuit, but i call it a pony suit.
Il just post the link and you can read it there

Copy/Cut/Paste is not available in Firefox? Really?
artist why is it bad that I don't celebrate halloween?
GreenPony: he's not shitting you, is he?
IshFrankenPony: idk, i was bored <_<
artist: I don't think someone would right something that sad to get recognition
GreenPony: that would be rather....inconvienient
artist: No kidding
I already posted a reply to the post telling him to cheer up, but I don't think it would be that east
*Easy
Ehhhh?
/me Sighs
/me gives bicyclerepairman a bike that's so badly damaged, not even the greatest bicycle repairmen can fix it
/me silence?
Yep.
All of the software my school uses is terrible
GreenPony: pffft, i've lived through depression, he is not likely to go insane
Snow :D you work on fursuits? AWESOME!
unless he genuinely has a mental illness artist
I think it's going to make me upload files one at a time too... wow
artist: That doesen't mean he is still not sad
Panda: yeah, but they are really expensive
who's sad?
Sundaysmile: we may only pray?
I don't know why but i've really been obsessed with this song lately http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrFQvGtRzYA

Shizuka: I can't find where I can buy the soundtrack anymore D:
Serenity he has said that it was "In the making" for quite while now, he sjust stopped mentioning it altogether for the last 2 years or so, anyway I guess thats a discussion for anothe rtime :P
Mary? wasn't that Silent Hill 2?
yeah
Lil_B: Well he confirmed this year that there will be a third one at some point
Serenity: 21.12.2012?
Malavolent: No :L
slender... well... got 5 pages before sudden cardiac arrest :P
monster emerges. dispatched
*heart attack
'ey Slendamann, Saul Slendamann
Slender 2 will be out probably by the end of the year
I was too afraid to even start playing Slender.
Sundaysmile: and this time it will have a DIFFERENT PIANO KEY! OMG
I don't like these kinds of games.
MadSurge: he only startled me once really... he sat in the freaking back of the truck the page was on... damn didn't see him till i was really close
you should play Cry of Fear Malavolent
Sundaysmile: Haha.
No.
how come? not like it?
/me walks in the front door, then breaks a window because some jokes have to be kept alive
?
Malavolent: don't bother, it's just jumpscare:the game
Sundaysmile: No, I just call things silly names for fun.
who's reading and what?
Ghosties. Silent Ponyville. I think.
I dislike horror games and I despise jumpscare games.
Then why are you playing Slender :P
Either that or just a Silent Hill fanfic.
Malavolent: because you get scared easily?
I said I've never played it.
So what's up, everyone?
Too scared.
Howdy Reikim!
Nothing much, Reikim. :)
MadSurge: Yeah, pretty much.
and then everyone told Reikim he won 3rd place
ah, I thought you said otherwise
How about you?
Malavolent: i don't like it either. just made an exception for halloween
my mistake
What did I miss?
AJIsAwesome! *hugs* Happy Halloween!
...Whut
WHUT
Whut
Art contest, and flutercry reading.
art contest 3rd place
...Huh
I won a contest of skill
/me throw hands in the air
MadSurge! *hugs* Happy Nightmare Night! :)
hey Reikim saw your pictures on the Art contest :)
I was just told.
Malavolent: well, you can watch LPs of those (not Slendamann, please :D )
I'm about as shocked as the rest of you.
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN
Reikim I guess "shocked" is the right adjective for today
...I'm confused
MadSurge: Well I watched 11 drunk guys playing slender etc. if that counts.
first RaveBrony http://i.imgur.com/ZiahI.jpg second panda http://i.imgur.com/06CNQ.jpg
:D
Reikim halloween, scared... sorry, my Puns are bad
prabably color
just guessing
...Holy fucksticks
Malavolent: go play House of the Dead, those games are fun and not very scary
Hey Lil_B, do you do anything special on Halloween in Germany?
ping?
The other entries must have been pretty bad.
Or L4D
RAVE
Hahaha
STOP BEING AWESOME
K?
O_o
Wow....i was actually expected to be hated for that pic
L4D is not scary at all.

Lol
Anyway yeah, if I could I would've done colour...
hey guys
RaveBrony well that's not luna
Didn't say it was.
Malavolent: But it sure is fun :).
Hell yeah.
Malavolent nope, Halloween doesn't exist (exept that itr got injected into Society during the last decate by Capitalism...) it's basiclly copying what the US is doing
Rave, it's fucking awesome.
I wouldn't be afraid of Slender, if you could defend yourself somehow.
It's the feeling of hopelessness that scares me.
Hi Starspooky :)
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: You want me to edit it for luna? Its a simple fix of a few layers O.o
Malavolent some elementary schools organize trick or treat rounds and a few people do halloween parties. But nothing major
Reikim: Thank you so much :)
Malavolent: Let me amend that: If him finding you didn't sound like GabeN falling on a piano
Malavolent I prtefer Amnesia over Slender :3
So yeaaaah.
some people don't get jokes
I wish I'd done colour, but not enough skill or time.
Hi, Starspooky. :)
Serenity: Hah, you made me lol with that :D
Need to learn SAI. Need to get tablet.
is nittany reading?
Oh I see, so halloween is basically the same as here.
i haven't got past doing rainbow dash http://i46.tinypic.com/fbas9k.png still need to fix it and do the rest of the mane six
and the background
I started out trying to trace the image in SAI but it huuuuuurt
and stuff
whos doing the reading
Lil_B: Well I played Amnesia at my friend's place, it was quite fun when there are more of you.
hey that's what i'm doing
Trying to do computer art with a mouse hurts.
British Halloween: Bunch of nabs come to your door asking for sweets and cake, and I'm like NOOEEE
Like a bitch.
11,02twilight_sprinkle: Ghosties :)
Although it's partially my fault for insisting on conserving the sketchy art style.
Ohai Tiowilight_sprankls :3
o, thx NewSpookyBronyU
Yeah
hi twilight_sprinkle
Serenity: Since when is there a tradition of trick-or-treating in UK?
O.o

http://i47.tinypic.com/24y4wms.jpg actually still thinking about just doing shadows
Malavolent: Since forever
11,02twilight_sprinkle: Happy Halloween :)
Hey, art on paper beat computer art by a Long shot
Helloween to you too :P
Hm?
Had derps at my door since '99
^^ I thought ghosties would have a more sinister voice.
*beats
happy Hallowing twilight_sprinkle ^^
Right?
Happy Halloween twilight_sprinkle!
Just checking.
It's only ghosties, what did you expect? :3
shana: you celebrating Halloween?
Lil_B: We don't even call it Halloween here, it's more like "the day when you remember the dead".
Malavolent: Day of the DED
I honestly tried doing it on computer, because it would have looked really nice.
However, it was way too time-consuming.
Serenity: Well, yeah.
Malavolent and it has nothing to do with Candy or Costumes right?
Lil_B: Not at all. And I don't think that trick-or-treating will get here anytime soon.
Malavolent yeah we have that too, but on another date
Hi, twilight_sprinkle. :)
brb

/me Panics because Internet is gone... sees disconnected WLan Stick >.<
Sorry, so many people are chatting with me atm x_x
That's okay.
It's usually quiet in here.

For once.
I like it.
No. <_<
It's...peaceful.

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Unicon Reminder: Discount Weekend Passes End Midnight Tonight
and chat is back to sleep. :3
I like it
yeah, enjoying the laid back attetude
/me meditates in the silence
I love the story so Far :3
He got kind of embarrassed and said it was "complicated"
What story is this?
Anyone got a link hanging around?
Well, I'm off to the bed. Good night everyone.
but what a Story it is... right Mark?
Night Malavolent :)
tell him the first thing you need to do is put your video into the recycling bin
We were like "Go try it again and come back if you still can't do it"
because thats where youtube looks for them
Lil_B: It sure is.
then you need to send it to youtube by clicking "empty recycling bin"
have a good morn..night Malavolent
haha, sad thing is a lot of our customers would probably believe that...
Ohay Mark
night, Malavolent. :3
night Malavolent !
people give windows a hard time about telling you to restart after updates
Ohai, Lil_B. :3
osx tells you much much more frequently.
At least he hasn't come back yet, so maybe he figured it out
Mark you are my favourite customer
bye Malavolent
Whelp, nothing much happening.
So
I'm out!
PEACE!
Lil_B: Thanks. Bye doggy!
bye Reikim
Bye Reikim. :3
/me jumps out through the window
bye reik... DAMNIT
People complain about that?
yes
Unless your computer takes forever to start up I don't see why it would matter
I dont like closing all my stuff.
but osx seriously pisses me off it reminds me every 5 minutes to restart
and you can't tell it to stop reminding you.
I just keep hitting postpone until I'm not doing anything anymore
That must be annoying
it is
at least with windows you can postpone it for like 4 hours
I have this old Mac Mini that I got from work; it's super slow so I barely ever use it
And that's the extent of my experience with OSX
Ive bitten the bullet and bought a few apple laptops
Just because I was pissed off at other stuff available.
I'm actually considering getting one as my next laptop
the chat seems ded
Ok what did I miss?
Ive had more problems with this laptop though than any other laptop i have owned
I'll just dual boot Windows
major issues where it locks up and wont do anything
And buy one used so I don't give Apple money :P
I take it your not an apple fan?
ok...
I actually do kind of like osx for productivity
I've never heard of a Mac laptop falling apart, unlike this piece of crap... :(
the gestures are nice.
swithcing around and multitasking seems more fluid.
Nothing much.
anyone up for some minecraft classic multiplayer?
It's like 50% brand loyalty and 50% not liking their business practices
Bwhauhua, saved a good piece that got deleted by youtube. :P
Vordox Fluttercrys reading?
Lil_B: No, there are many good videos that gets taken down by youtube
silent ponyville?
pot80 you mean the free version you can play in your browser?
I have to admit something though, I do own an iphone.
I just got lucky one of my favourite One Piece stuff. :p
oh :P
but the new nexus 4 is mightly tempting @ $299 unlocked
off contract
thats a great buy for a smartphone.
Lil_B: yeah the game screws over when I try using the main game :P
carrots?
I like my Galaxy S2, but it's the only smartphone I've ever owned
So I don't have much for comparison
pot80 but what do you wanna do in the classic version? you can only place blocks :P
I agree apple is not the nicest company to deal with
hi everypony :) EHRMAGERD GHOSTIES STREAM? :O
Lil_B: I dunno maby a project of some sort?
ohai everypony :3
Hi, cachi01. Nope, SB stream. :3
Hi cashieoweone :3

the screen on the retina macbook is really nice though.
cachi01: Ghosties is reading a story, but SB's streaming it.

ooooooohh
chat just got u User-Injection to revive it
oh wow a fanfic reading eh
Im considering an ipad mini.
Or the 4th gen ipad‚Ä¶ haven't decided.
probably unnessecary.
btw guys i need help, seems like my big bro got addicted to WoW, i have trouble now going to internet because he's using the pc all the time
read 40 creepypasta yesterday.........im scared of my own shadow and weird exe files now :D
I remember when you were saying the iPad was the stupidest thing ever
I'm getting "No Mercy" vibes from L4D with this hospital setting.
Everyone made fun of it when it first came out... now everyone loves it
it is stupid
valoreins: I'm sorry to say, you're screwed.
Its gimmicky.
valoreins: WoW addiction? uhmmm yeah thas iincurable
and I hardly ever use mine.
:P
then why would you buy another one? lol
Because I kind of want one with cellular connection so I can use it whereever,.
i just dont get it, i also played Wow but i never get addicted, dafuq big bro?
would make it more useful.
I dont like tethering because it sucks battery too much.
valoreins: yeah its a hell of an addiction (thinks back to worlds greatest freakout)
I have an ipad 2 i bought a while back
valoreins: Is he A RPG Type of guy?
I bought the original one too but i gave it to my dad.
thelonepony: yup
Well WoW Is A mmorpg so
YOur fuck
I don't own any tablets
your*
All I can say is... WoW! (I'm sorry I had to)
I'm considering getting one though so I don't have to lug this huge laptop with me everywhere
Scamfuckinwow :P
now i'll have less time here because of that, screw it
valoreins: Get a Computer/laptop
valoreins: I was like that for awhile, then my free trial ran out XD
that friend I was talking about before just got that Nexus 7 to replace his HP Touchpad
why did i read then my free trial ran out as but then i took an arrow to the knee?
He bought the touchpad when it was on sale for $99 and is now selling it for $130...
Eli: no, I even forgot it was today :)
cachi01: I have no idea
Wasnt the HP touchpad discountinued?
yes
No one wants to buy it from him because he went around bragging when he bought it about how cheap it was
shana: yeah, we don't really celebrate it here... shame tho
they did a firesale of them for $99
I remember
brb
I wanted to get one but everywhere sold out.
cachi01: whaaa? XD Me no understand
lol
I probably shouldive bought one too
all I got from that was arrow to the knee
and last time he was mad at me because i use the pc when he want to capture some kind of rare monster that spawn during a specific time
I tried for a few days but no luck
everyone is trying to sell them now for more than $99 and no one wants to buy haha.
cant blame them
valoreins: tell him to get Guild wars II
That's what I said
lol
So he doesnt bitch about Rare monster spawnings
Black Friday :) thats the day I'm waiting for
And then another friend told me I "don't understand economics"
okay...
pot80: he was saying that when he read what I had put up, instead of reading the last part that said "then my free trial ran out" , he thought it said"but then I took an arrow to the knee" haha
is that silent hill 2 in novel form?
lol
oh my...... look at all the zelda creepys o_O
I'm hoping for a real good deal on a tablet that day
valoreins I'm glad I dislike MMORPG's it dosent sound like a healthy addiction
I might buy a 42 inch lcd tv on black friday if there are any good deals so I can turn it into a multitouch table.
cachi01|creepypasta: if you find any good ones, care to pm them to me?
well RaveBrony care to give me an opinion on this ? http://i50.tinypic.com/eq2xdg.png
Avoid walmart that day >.>
:o Cool
I avoid walmart all the time
lol
oni_link: long journey will be long....but ok :)
my relatives went to walmart last year on black friday
I just dislike their staff.
I avoid everywhere on black friday
okie doki lokie :)
they were in line to buy something and a fright broke out
The internet is the best black friday.
ohai pony pepple
hi IshFrankenPony
i don't get why people got addicted by MMOs... i played many of those and got bored eventually
Ohai IshFrankenPony :)
I went to a fight and a walmart broke out,.
pot80: then again, console gamers think that about anything on PC
Ohai IshFrankenPony :)
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I love it :)
Hi, IshFrankenPony. :)
/me isn't celebrating Halloween
^
^^
I use to avoid everywhere on black friday but common...you are not going to see this stuff everyday
^^^
Howdy IshFrankenPony!
I am to boring... :P
you should shorten Twilights head tho :P
I bought skylanders on black friday :D
It was such a sweet deal
/me wishes he could, but he's at college and there's nothing going on there.
oni_link hey i played minecraft and portal on mah pc XD
how so Brovakiin|Assassin ??
If it ever goes down lower than $40 I might consider buying it
http://i.imgur.com/liv8Q.png
My motto is‚Ä¶ don't get caught up in sales because theres always going to be more sales.
oni_link: I just prefer to stay in over going to partys and what not :P
Oh wrong channel
:)
but with all that stuff it comes with I doubt that'll happen
did you mean the opposite? :P
pot80: Yeah I know, but Im just saying that that is what they think. EG: my friends
is it odd that when I here silent hill I think of coldplay's violet hill?
lol
uhh I missed it

08,01because we do it slightly different here

Is my country the only one where haloween is absolutely non existant?

russia
My haloween costume consists of trowsers a shirt and a gun (helps with getting sweets)
08,01xles: how utterly odd
Indeed.

08,01i'd have just given them a piece of dog fluff
granted, if kids would bang on my door this time of the day I would be a bit...angry.

00,10not bad
the screen is smaller than my hand
So now everyone is trying to kill me to ;~;
People using the Scout must love this power. :D
probably i'll get a nice pc next month
Who's the worst person to uber in this game?
cachi01|scaryshit same, my pc is ~5 years old now
AJIsSpooky: mmmmm spy
What about the Medic?
That would be useless too, right?
AJIsSpooky: medic has his needle gun thing
AH.
Okay. Thanks, cachi01|scaryshit. :)
where? me?
aight im back from my dinner and im full right now
AJIsSpooky actually, if 2 medics had full uber and they constantly healed each other, they could do a strong Uber push into a well-built nest. I wouldn't recommend it, but it is possible.
Moopy what did you have?
lol shizu doesnt forgive
now she is ded
speghtti
yeah
Woah. That's pretty cool, Lunar_Brony|TF2. :O
with texas bread
Mmh, loving spaghetti
ikr
Lotsa spaghetti! :3
Now im hungry ;3;
i just ate just now
AJIsSpooky: gay luigi?
cachi01|scaryshit: Toast! :3
so thats why i came back in my bedroom
Dat "Brain" avatar :D
AJIsSpooky it would take some strategy and teamwork, but it could, in theory, let a pair of medics push with a 16-second long Ubercharge. One uber lasts 8 seconds and when one shorts out, you hit the other one
I've done it once before, but also seen it fail a lot
Wow.
and now im eating a frozen fruit bar right now and its so good
/me is eating hot cakes
I'm having a bonbon right now :3
I just got back from eating, too. ;D
*:D

:O
thriller time
uhmmm they are also called pancakes
oh

Darkness falls across the land...
And then the fire nation attacked....

i used to be an adventurer like you
damn you buffer!
but then i took a fire nation to the knee
And I blamed it on Dinkleberg.

Achievements won't be earned, items won't drop, etc.

Lol yes
/me gets out the shock paddles
cachi01: But, their market strategy is so brilliant! Steal competitor's ideas and try to make them sound original, add shitloads of DRM and other nasty components, act genuinely surprised when people point out that they don't like this sort of thing.
:D
that is my favorite of the three jobs
Why aren't they just rolling in dough?
Maybe I am a hipster ._.
Whys that?
:<
It's the least boring, and I like my coworkers

AJIsSpooky: Note that the picture is actually a year or two old
Ah.
She even bought the episode 6 costume of Leia
Long before he sold it
he knew what was going to happen :O
Coulcn't you just airblast the rockets back at it?
How did Disney even afford Lucus studios?
*Couldn't
They spend a crap load on Marvel a few years ago
DerpyMuffins: its fuckin disney it can afford you, it can afford me, it can afford anyone of us
ONLY 4?
it was way more
not just 4
Disney got it cheap
:O
Oh yeah
Its that awful
Yes it was just $4.5 bil
I hope the next time you eat it, you get ice cream cancer
:(
Wow not even 4.5
Kidding no sad
BARELY OVER 4.
Wait are they doing old school Disney with Lucus studios?
Okay I read it wrong

Hey everyone :)
^
AJIsSpooky: http://denver.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw575_Applejack_Spooky.gif
It was more expensive to buy Pixar, which was 7 nil
so does this mean we will have a deadpool sith?
bil
So both Marvel and Lucus studios for less than 10 billion total?
Can airblasts negate the charge from Demomen?
RoboGerbil: Most likely
Ello everyone
Hi Psycho
creepy_sprinkle: I'm saving that. ;D
Hey TOY_PON3 long time no see :3

*gives pokeman icecream*
Alright, thanks. :)
Hey Psycho
Pumpkins47: O U x3
TOY_PON3: :)
I guess how good it is depends on what director gets put in charge of it
what happens if Disney sets its sights on Habro? O_O - :) try sleeping with that thought
Hi, Psycho. :)
No just no CypressWerewolf
Like this guy? http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/vanilluxe.jpg

Greetings chat, i come from the future. It is a sad time, there are only two major powers left, Hasbro and Disney. The war between them is furious, many losses have happened.

04There's no way I could do it live, too much stuff going on this week
Hi slendy
DerpyMuffins, why not?
Diamond is too stuck up
and uptight
DerpyMuffins, but Snails is one heck of a stallion
well according to the comic
Not right now he isnt
which takes place several years later
so that's why it's funny
cause you don't expect that
I dont expect BluebloodXFluttershy
and it might happen
WHO KNOWS
Sorry, having a group meeting about stupid programming stuff

See ya, sorry I'm boring
Your not lol
ok it's only filled with dumb OCs OF THE PAST
:P
It's a reading
If your gonna be here tomorrow ill show up
WEll, I think I just had the worst Halloween ever....
I probably will
You wanna know why?
why?
I just avoided it.
What happened, GreenPony?
you had a bunch of little brats tresspass on your lawn?
Sweet, cya *bites*
GreenPony, no candy?
see ya
oh wait you might be some special snowflake
Ok, I giving away candy, wasn't dressed up in a costuem, just wore a MLP shirt, some jeans and some halloween makeup
Everything was going fine,
i can see where this is going
Till the last guy who visited my house wiht his kid
OLOLOLLO MLP SUX
I give his kid the candy, he notices my shirt
And you wanna know what he called me?
here we go
He called me a faggot
called it
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrn
o.o
I don't ANYONE has ever called me that before
HA, YOU'RE A CIGGERETTE!
^
And what make's it wors, he called me that just because of what I was wearing.....
GreenPony, and you care because?
And you took his candy back, right?
^
^^
I didn't do anything
So he thinks you're a bundle of sticks and branches bound together?
thats good too and oAO
GreenPony: How old are you and how old was this child?
the kid was 7, and im 17
I was dumbfounded that he called me gay in front of his kid
BREAKING NEWS Someone called another person a faggot, more at midnight
GreenPony: And why do you care what some little kid calls you?
08,01so, um
it wasnt the kid that called him
DocSane, this is what his father called him
That kid didn't call me a faggot
08,01i laughed way too hard at this: http://i.imgur.com/Bmdrs.jpg
Ooooh....
The fucking father did....
GreenPony: -shrug- It's a kid. Kids do dumb stuff --Oh the father called you that?!
Now that's just retarded..
GreenPony: i wouldve told him hes a terrible parent, i bet he wouldve lked that
I shut the door, went up to my room
...
GreenPony: I think we can conclude that the dad is a jackass.
Nah, just ignore people like him GreenPony.
And took the booze that was under my mattress and drank
...
Holy crap you did all that cause he called you a faggot?
Get your shit together man.
I know it seems like a bit of an overreaction
GreenPony, it is
But.....
Woah . . . .~.;
GreenPony: Kid, you need to be a little stronger in life.
I think im gonna get off now
Sooo I usually RP vidja games by naming my charactor after a pony char.
Il be on tomorrow, bye
Oh >: Ok...-hugs GreenPony-
GreenPony: you shouldnt care what he called you, but i would probably have told him to buck off and that hes a terrible parent lol
A lot of people gets called faggots and they TAKE it in.
Damn he needs to lighten up.
erm.. wat?
I recently got my hands on SKYRIM
People can be such idiots.
Running out of options I began to use the villians of MLP
StinkomanFan: ok seeya in like 4 days
You live your he live his
it stop there and you move on
now can you please stop being a special snowflake?
IN OTHER WORDS
That dad probably just did it without any thought. He ended up ruining that kid's evening.
CrimsonPhoenix: dude hes gone already, give it a rest wiseguy
oh...
didn't noticed that
And so begins the quest of THANE BLUEBLOOD, SAVIOR OF SKYRIM
And... mute.
I swear, some people act like gays, Muslims, and fat people are the last groups they can feel free to insult.
And suddenly chat goes silent for me...

Shizuka knows how its done
I guess you could say that, haha
http://www.downloadmoreram.com/
/me wants candy but has none
Nobody seems to want to go trick or treating in an apartment complex for some reason, but they'll go in a neighborhood.
i'd turn on my sprinkler system on halloween
I still have a whole metal bowl full. In fact, I'd take a picture but I don't know how to mute the camera sound on the Galaxy SIII
cachi01|scaryshit: legit as hell
teach those little punks to beg for free stuff
I want to hug myself as a pony...but wait, I AM a pony...shouldn't that means I hugs a human...No! I am a human! Gaaah!
13why mute it? does it sound like an air raid?
This is confusing!!
cachi01|scaryshit: does that actually work?
cachi01|scaryshit: wat?
eddmario: ha if you find out, let me know XD
Brony2447|SugarRush: no xDD

AJIsSpooky: o no ;~; I's never beat it
/me shivers
Why not, oni_ghost? ;~;
So I found out that my mom's credit card has about 30,000 points. To compare, a simple dvd/cd is roughly 2,400 points.

flutter_spin: yeh those points usually only last a year
She has this 'spend the money before she gets it' mentality. She is obsessed with $0 in the bank
But yeah. No idea what to do with the points.

Previously on 'the guy that can jump 10 meters and survive a rocket launcher shot'
Kojima was sick of MGS when he made MGS4
Shizuka: he didnt scope in to tighten the shell spread...
this won't be any better
must be in a james bond universe.. no bullets ever hit people unless from bonds gun
13isn't that the guy from skyrim
RoboGerbil: thats because the bad guys are stormtroopers
Good afternoon everyone :)
Shizuka: he used to be the guy from skyrim
Hi AdamTheDuck :)
BUT THEN HE TOOK AN ARROW TO THE KNEE!
goddamnit cachi01|scaryshit
Wait. Wait. Wait. Halo 4 on xbox360. That's something I could probably get using points
Shizuka in a video game, it's possible: Borderlands 2's new Mechromancer. 350 stacks of Anarchy and point-blank with a shotgun.
I missed.
-.(\
twice
flutter_spin: do eet :o
give me your guns so youre unarmed while you run away from bad guys
I'll have to wait until its released. They got XCOM on the list already. I don't think it will be an issue
13CUTSCEME: THE MOVIE: the game
O-o
but then I shot a guy 2 levels higher than me with full shield and health (somehow) and he died instantly

Dark Ness
Shizuka: it's a game, pretty good though isn't it?
the sowing of doubt
13this is a game?
Shizuka: eeyup
The Playstation 3 has no games.
Shizuka: this aint MGS4
Shizuka: Uncharted 3: Among Thieves
otakon: WRONG
The Playstation 3 is the world's best 600 movie player.
I thought otakon was leaving..
I am
600 dollar
than GTFO!
I just wanted to catch this scene
oh
otakon: Drakes Deception
ah
that's why YouTube was invented
13TABLE FLIP
that title makes more sense now
now GTFO
Buytoast: Five hundred and ninety nine U S dollars
Buytoast: You mean no original exclusive to the console games? But what about Ratchet & Clank, and the PS3 versions of games like Arkham City, Lollipop Chainsaw, etc
FOLLOW THAT WAITER!
13and now it's modern warfare 2
otakon: among thieves was number 2 though
yeah
you can't catch that guy, he must LIVE!!
13when do we get into the test chamber
Shizuka: not enough explosions
There's going to be a MW4
lol
okay now I am off to bed see you all later
Lunar_Brony: Why?
dat door slam
hurry, waggle your Playstation Move to catch the villain
and for an additional 9.99
lmao
get the bonus speed booster mega pack
cya ot... fucker
13a closed door
13how ever will we get past
wups
gotta love his scream :D
@Shizuka LOL
:D
13and now it's assassins creed again
oni_ghost because people are never satisfied until a series is milked beyond the point of being dry
Drake is freakin superhuman.
which it reached at MW3/Black Ops II
flutter_spin: Yep, been mentioned several times here
I just found out! :P
that bus has some good brakes
13three day old news
Wow. He knows how to take a hit from a stopping car
Lunar_Brony: I lost interest at MW2, MW3 was just $60 MW2 DLC as far as I'm concerned. And COD4 will still be the best to me <3
13and we hear it, what thirty times a day now
:( sorry
urprise, mothabucka
old news is old and, like game/movie etc... series, will be milked dry
13and now it's the bourne ultimatum
What kinda of knowledge does this douche have that lets him navigate the city liek this??
13this movie just doesn't know what it wants to rip off
if you're going to rip off something, why not make it EVERYTHING?
Movie. Kek.
well its not like no game is allowed to have this kind of style if there were a few movies/games with it
RIPOFF ALL THE THINGS!!!!!
Because it's f*cking stupid!
Lunar_Brony: Unfortunately and Halo is well on its way of becoming the next COD since they said Halo4 is the first of the "new triology"
13that was spore's idea
13and spore sucked
well today was fun but i have to go to bed cya everypony :(
:)*
bye cachi01|scaryshit !
bye cachi01|scaryshit
oni_ghost . . . did you just say "Trilogy"?
Night cachi01|scaryshit L)
:)*
Kandarihu|OldComp: but i liked ep 3..
13and now it's mirrors edge
Lunar_Brony: Yeah they annouced it when Reach was released.
13and leap of faith into the hay bale
There is only one trilogy with a 4 in it
What is this RE4?
lawl

@Shizuka: Entirely pointless.

My question is . . . why the fuck don't they kill this guy?
11,02Night thelonepony :)
Bye Sprunkle :3
well, it seemed fun, so why not
Lunar_Brony: He has plot armor.
Wow, it even ripped off Metroid Other M with that do you remember me scene Shizuka
13never played it
Damn, name is too long >.<
DAT rope
It was horrendous
Team Ninja needs to stick to well... Ninjas.
13is he french, texan, or... WHAT IS THIS GUY
ROFL
OK
:D
Losing means going back and doing it over again. Winning means getting captured and interrogated. That's how story-based games are.
wait wait wait, this managed to rip off Other M? That's beyond low!
ow
Why would you want to rip off Other M?
Lunar_Brony: Yeah that dude with the cowboy hat said, Remember Me?
oh
oh wow
didnt need the commma
13wow
ROFL
13nice of them to make the chair from graham crackers
Plot chairs--they break like glass.
hahahaha
13and rope made of silly string
now for some Arkham City brawling
Drake is the ubermensch, apparently.
13so is this when he gets the arm blade?
I have Arkham City.
Still need to get around to playing it.
I dont own it, I want it though
Wat

Next year we'll see Halo 5 with a chracter who, in every scene, will be drinking Mountain Dew with the label facing the player.

so who else has seen the gameloft ad for the pony game using Trixie as the spokespony?
Of Course Trixie is the SAlesmare for This Game, Trixie Needed the bits for her New stage and Trixie Could not pass teh chance to promote somethin with Trixie on it
i haven't
it might be free, the pricing hasnt been stated yet
it's free and microtransaction
lots of gameloft games are free, but have adds
the 3d animation isnt all that bad
my only question is the game is for iphone or ipad
iphone ipad android
i would link the ad if I was allowed too

We really should stream Sadowrun Returns once it gets released
I've actually just been in a shadowrun game that's ended
Ended? Impossible
Modified so that there no magic 9simply high tech)
well it's ended because the GM said we're done
I see. But magic is kind of the deal with Shadowrun
wseriously was expecting the msp sound there btw
mgs*
yeah but so is high cyberware and hacking. there was lots of hacking. The Driver/ hacker's catch phrase was 'OPEN ALL THE DOORS'
It would appear I'm no longer the only shoujo.
Did you ever play the SNES game?
nope
hell I didn't even really know about roleplaying until I got Baldur's gate
It plays kind of like the old Fallout games. The creator of Shadowrun (pen and paper) is remaking it for PC
2D, turn based and plays like the old
ooh, are you familiar with shadowrun novels?
Never read them but the SNES game is based on Don't Deal With a Dragon
I mean my dad played this thing called D&D and I would have to stay over with my Dad's friends kids
HMM
sorry
unless you're a different Misha, I guess
eenope..
shadowrun returns... is it more like the snes version, the genesis version, or the crap microsoft version?
but until Baldur's gate i didn't really acknowledge it
SNES/Mega Drive
assuming its a game of course :p
Let's forget about the Microsoft version.....
well the snes and genesis/mega drive verions were... different as well :p
It is a game. See previous comment
i must research this then
The creator of the pen and paper Shadowrun is remkaing the SNES game for PC
/me shrugs and gets back in bed
2D, turn based, plays like old Fallout games
Good morning :3
Good morning Ponies47
are they updating the System material to 4e?
Ew, 4e
Don't know
halllo Ponies47
There is a kickstarter with everything you need to know
Hanako 4e Shadowrun not D&D
mutterguy_: oh okay
Google Shadowrun Returns
4e d&d is pig disgusting
Last time i checked they had 2 million dollar
okay
so seeing as they have deckers, I am correct in assuming they are not using the latest shadowrun rules? :)
Hanako i have similar reservations. D&D shouldn't be a board game...
I wonder how easy it is to abuse kickstarter...
take all the stuffs(damn you fallout)
what do you mean Alchemist
it does look good though
Ryunosuke: I don't know. I honestly haven't playe pen and paper Shadowrun for like 11 years
alexxm: I cant help to think, what if someone announces a bullshit project, one he doesnt even intend to do, but gets hundreds of thousands of dollars donations.
Alchemist surely they have to produce an end product though
same here, its been a while, but i know that ... hacking and the matrix hasa gone under significant changes
Shadowrun Returns is due january 2013
well since the SNES/Mega Drive versions
It would have been awesome if it would have been released on 21 december 2012 *wink wink*
what year is it set in is my question :p
alexxm: yeah, one that can be made with minimal effort and minimal budget and looks nothing like the one product they announced
yeah they use wifi now
The Awakening
alexxm: I dont know what kind of follow up is there from the part of the site.
I would guess 2051 if it based on the SNES/Mega Drive game
c'mon Awakening, mutate me to a Dwarf...
^
Well we still got 2 months to go before the manastorm
I would settel for a half elf physical adept
4e is currently set in the 2070s
hmm
Holy shit.
Walking army
if the primer is to be anything of a setting, its set before Dunkelzhan (sp?)
Dunkelzahn died in the 2050's right?
Who?
Well he is dead now...
oh wait
moin everypony ^^
Hello Invi :3
Barbetos: a character from the Shadowrun rpg

Still tidying up though.

Misha: The Dragon Heart trilogy definitely, Black Madonna is great, LX-IR, Technobabel. all good books
When I woke up during the earthquake, I legitimately thought it was just huge winds banging the windows.
JRP, just explaining to Misha
should i continue the cupcakes song remix or sleepeis?
Then dad rushed in and told me to GTFO of bed, because the earth was quaking.
._.
that's was my thoughts about the 7.1 too.
augmenteded eyes
Alchemist: I'll look them up, thanks bro
The second bigish one (the aftershock that actually caused deaths) happened literally as I sat down in my computer chair one lunch time.
I just realised. In decmeber i have been watching FiM for 2 years
whos seens james rolfes youtube channel background recently?
yeah it took me 20 seconds from waking my eyes to getting up and under the door frame. ~4:35 is a god awful time to be woken up
ikr.
JRP2234: James Rolfe = AVGN?
well, precautions.
none actually happened :p
JRP2234: ohai random OC pony in the background :)
yeah because the epicentre was around Charing cross (actually close to my Grandada's old farm)
