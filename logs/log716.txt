^
00,10so yes, he is evil. in a way
Clean and efficient~ :3
Cutest Asshole Ever.
In a way
But he doesnt ean harm. He just doesnt understand humans.
Well, Kyuubey is evil. Not out of malice, but indifference.
00,10he's more brutaly logical
00,10so
i like eeeeeeeeeeee
^^^^
YOU dont know

Eyes can display a lot of emotion
00,10both my nieces 12 and 8 have already developed.
8? .-.
00,10yes
girls develop earlier then boys
That thing is evil but a sort of good evil in my eyes. Not evil or cruel just... doesn't really understand... I'm wrong arn't I?
Japan has their own set of rules? :$
00,10more of a stigma then a hard rule
i heard this anime had mind blowing weirdness to it, or is mind blowing weirdness and understatment?
an*
00,10in a way yes
00,10where is 13 is bad luck
Oooooh yeah, and something with 7 iirc.
I think my teacher said 7 was sickness
It's been too long since I did Jap ;~;
00,10and yeah red's back story time
Kyouko
4 in Japanese is pronounced "Shi"
00,10could be
00,10aces and 8's are also bad in western
Although, there's another pronounciation of 4: yon

Oh, all of those chairs supposedly evokes another series called Bokurano which is also about a group of children getting a horrible raw deal.
Bah, I phrased it wrong.
00,10human = energy
back in my day we played battle field 1942, on a real battlefield
00,10to fuel the uneverse
just experimenting with the livestream. It appears the different theaters are only to reduce stress on the server and that the chatrooms are virtually identical
00,10you could have also asked
i get that feeling
she eats a lot :/
Kyouko gave Madoka a snack that she actually paid for figuring that Madoka would have the same aversion to stolen food.
Never tell lies, only half truths
but half truths are worse than lies

My mac just exploded. o_o

bounce like my checks did, back in the day

^
isnt she though?
just saying
This is gonna be a bit hard to follow.
And come the biggest plot twist of the anime
Uguuuu~
ya.
Then open
Depends*
Then eyes open
If this series aired during Prime Time, the sponsors would be very upset over the fact that Madoka hasn't been seen as a Magical Girl until now
NM.
00,10kinda an odd role reversal
bbl
Hey everypony
i was like WTF M8
00,10figure it out yet?
then*
Awwww
She probably used her magic to heal her heart as soon as she woke up in the hospital.

00,10she also has malletspace
00,10so yeah they are now showing all her time loops
not all

SAD FACE!
00,10realy glad they did not have the gun shot

Dat pissed/sad face
00,10alll the dakka

walpurgis night
00,10and then we have ep1
the music for this is amazing

such a creep creature
*heroine
how hard is it to fight in high heels
00,10queue terminator theme
UGH! Nuuuuu My mac! It's dying! D;
00,10oh and yeah, whole ep is over and now opening theme
IKR!
magical quartet?
00,10glad they did that
00,10cause the opening would have spoiled that ep
she has a kitty cat
and i want it
... or not.
Or bad luck?
00,10probably somthing to do with her coming back from a wake
both technically
if
00,10they have been intefearing for decades
00,10oh look, suns comeing up
It's it's a Shinto thing. My bad
Oh it's*
It's not like they can't be translated.
00,10he dont like the honorifics
00,10here we go.
No, I don't like leaving Mahou Shojo and Majou in Japanese.
The honorifics I mean
My stance on honorifcs has softened over the years.
...this is all going over my head right now
00,10as I pray.......
00,10yes she keeps all that in her pocket
A friend of mine hates this show.
She hates all things "girly", hates magical girl shows, and HATES how this story went.
Good night gentlemen.
00,10it's world building is lacking
00,10right
How much Yamato have you seen?
before i go on with my day I have this to say about this anime

13i hate comcast
13so much
13can't even begin to describe how much i hate comcast
kk
13i can't
13my connection sucks today
oh cool i can use my name again brb
13we pay $75 a month for 12/4 with comcast, and this year we've had maybe 80% uptime
13can't tether
:/ how come?
13costs too much
13for three lines with unlimited data it'll be $150 a month
13and that was the best offer
13t-mobile
its ok
bfbrb (back from brb (back from be right back))
13not to mention that the "unlimited" is really "4G speed up to 2GB, then 2G speed after that" which means we may as well be on dialup if we tethered
unless I had the computer infront of me..
13that's america
Mmm...s'pose I should get some wool
Wooool~

I just rooted my phone and tethered that way >.>

regardless*
don't celebrate it*
Trick or treat! :)
:)
He really is underrated.
ohokay
What's really annoying is that kids in my neighbourhood still celebrate it.
no wait as i walk i ment not write lol
I thought they'd have learned by now.
/me gives Maid_Mayor smores
best thing is scaring little kids with tricks not treats
?
and rp isnt allowed
There's a series?
oh no nothing like that lol, masks hiding in bushes that sort of thing....that doesnt help my case does it
If you guys want too I need a volunteer to help me
:P
Damn.
Aw. =9
My keyboard is dieing
lol
I can't be bothered to find batteries.
Lithium-ion batteries are best batteries.
people still use wireless keyboards?
No memory effect is the best.
is there a stream?
I can make a room.
And I dunno why. Its not like I would do it during a stream.
advertising other rooms is against rules
Cuase you know, I would want to watch the streams
thing is people tend to go overboard in rp
no matter how you try to stop them
RP in itself is allowed, but yeah, excessive amounts of it isn't allowed and it does have a tendency to go overboard.
!cd
SOON.
Not soon enough
I can't wait to observe the Mane 6 rooms from the comfort of regulars.
Yup.
...I facepalmed.
That's means we had to suffer from more Jar Jar Blinks...
^
I can only hope for it taking place in the Old Republic.
:<
Jedi Civil War*
I want some Revan and Malak up in these films.
Well they've already stated they'll do another three involving the cast from Star Wars IV onwards no?
Eh. I would not see a chatventure as an rp, but I can see how it would turn into that very easily.
sorry not the cast
the characters
And that would be against the rules fo sho.
I dunno, I like McGregor. I just think he had a case of bad writing.
and disney's sequels don't seem to make the cut...
Netsplit?
Well, to be fair, after SWTOR, it's an act of mercy to put the franchise out of its misery
looks like it..
I kind of want to play KoTOR now.
though it could've been worse... it could've been bought by 4kids entertainment or something
http://7.asset.soup.io/asset/3851/6887_c1e9.jpeg

I don't like these kinds of games.
No.

I dislike horror games and I despise jumpscare games.
I said I've never played it.
Too scared.

The other entries must have been pretty bad.
Or L4D
Hahaha

L4D is not scary at all.

Didn't say it was.
It's the feeling of hopelessness that scares me.
some people don't get jokes
I wish I'd done colour, but not enough skill or time.
Need to learn SAI. Need to get tablet.

Helloween to you too :P
Hm?

Right?
Just checking.
I honestly tried doing it on computer, because it would have looked really nice.
However, it was way too time-consuming.

Hi Twiolight_Sprankls :3

wow
i shall celebrate today by staying home and doing homework
...but with cheetos!
I want some sweets
ALL OF IT

But man I wish I'd been around for that...
I seem to be building a habit of missing the presentations for contests I place in.
ikr
Tomorrow is a holiday here in Italy :D
'dat Plop quiz
sholdnt be too hard though hopefully
Time to head out now, too bad I can't make it for all the stories ;~;
Maths and MOAR maths

The hyphonlicious?
Anyway
Someone ping me when we start playing GAYMES
Pah
My name is ShadowQuillSecond there
this is gettin good ^_^
People still here/
?
That's okay.
It's usually quiet in here.
For once.
I like it.
No. <_<
It's...peaceful.
okay ayejay >_>
I like it
yeah, enjoying the laid back attetude
/me meditates in the silence
He got kind of embarrassed and said it was "complicated"
Anyone got a link hanging around?
We were like "Go try it again and come back if you still can't do it"
haha, sad thing is a lot of our customers would probably believe that...
osx tells you much much more frequently.
Whelp, nothing much happening.
I'm out!
PEACE!
/me jumps out through the window
bye reik... DAMNIT
People complain about that?
yes
but osx seriously pisses me off it reminds me every 5 minutes to restart
and you can't tell it to stop reminding you.
I just keep hitting postpone until I'm not doing anything anymore
That must be annoying
it is
And that's the extent of my experience with OSX
Ive bitten the bullet and bought a few apple laptops
I'm actually considering getting one as my next laptop
Ive had more problems with this laptop though than any other laptop i have owned
ok...
I actually do kind of like osx for productivity
I've never heard of a Mac laptop falling apart, unlike this piece of crap... :(
the gestures are nice.
swithcing around and multitasking seems more fluid.
Nothing much.
I have to admit something though, I do own an iphone.
oh :P
off contract
thats a great buy for a smartphone.
carrots?
I agree apple is not the nicest company to deal with
Hi cashieoweone :3
its 4AM in my place :D
the screen on the retina macbook is really nice though.
when I go use anyone elses laptop you can instantly tell the difference.
ooooooohh
oh wow a fanfic reading eh
Or the 4th gen ipad… haven't decided.
probably unnessecary.
I remember when you were saying the iPad was the stupidest thing ever
I'm getting "No Mercy" vibes from L4D with this hospital setting.
Everyone made fun of it when it first came out... now everyone loves it
it is stupid
Its gimmicky.
and I hardly ever use mine.
:P
then why would you buy another one? lol
would make it more useful.
I dont like tethering because it sucks battery too much.
I have an ipad 2 i bought a while back
I don't own any tablets
your*
All I can say is... WoW! (I'm sorry I had to)
Scamfuckinwow :P
now i'll have less time here because of that, screw it
He bought the touchpad when it was on sale for $99 and is now selling it for $130...
yes
No one wants to buy it from him because he went around bragging when he bought it about how cheap it was
I remember
brb
I wanted to get one but everywhere sold out.
lol
I probably shouldive bought one too
all I got from that was arrow to the knee
everyone is trying to sell them now for more than $99 and no one wants to buy haha.
cant blame them
lol
And then another friend told me I "don't understand economics"
okay...
lol
oh my...... look at all the zelda creepys o_O
I'm hoping for a real good deal on a tablet that day
Avoid walmart that day >.>
:o Cool
I avoid walmart all the time
lol
they were in line to buy something and a fright broke out
I went to a fight and a walmart broke out,.
/me isn't celebrating Halloween
^
^^^
I am to boring... :P
you should shorten Twilights head tho :P
If it ever goes down lower than $40 I might consider buying it
http://i.imgur.com/liv8Q.png
My motto is… don't get caught up in sales because theres always going to be more sales.
Oh wrong channel
:)
did you mean the opposite? :P
lol
uhh I missed it
its ok, you'll get it sometime.
too much forehead ?
or just plain tall ?
