Shizuka: 1v1 me cod4 bro you won't

Gold_Demona: and yet none of the two gave as trouble capturing them as a wild Metang I found before Kyurem o_o
heh
MadSurge, That's odd, because usually legendaries are the hardest to catch
Gold_Demona: seriously, that thing didn't want to be captured
bloddy celstia
Mr_Anybody, moustache? Pfft, try beards. http://fav.me/d3bxnv2
Gold_Demona: legendaries rejected 3/5 balls before giving up, that Metang made me waste at least ten :|
MadSurge, I like to catch those things as Beldum though and evolve them up. :3
:P
00,02that circle thing is a scouts dream
Gold_Demona: yeah, but I didn't find Beldum
Only Metangs
True
why so many pony mods?
Mr_Anybody, Why not so many pony mods?
Mr_Anybody: because friendship is magic
can't argue with that
Because ponies \o/
00,02dat spray
NO MORE
MadSurge, Ah, I see. Can't catch Beldum in that game.
WE NEED TO KILL IT
g_k
:D
LONG LIVE ZOO PALS!!!
MadSurge, Looking at Serebii. Only way to get Beldum is to breed Metang.
bass cannon
Gold_Demona: told you, there's tons of evolved mons in there, but not their preevolutions
the cart?
MadSurge, That sucks. =/
Gold_Demona: yep
MadSurge, Cuz I like catching them in their first form, and I hate breeding.

so in bronsong
i never finihsed b2
Archie is a good artist.
and found a shiny boldore and got it
not too long ago
What's the difference anyway? Shiny gets better stats?

I found a shiny Floatzel once in my Pearl Nuzlocke.

Didn't catch it cuz I already had a Floatzel
MadSurge: Color. Nothing else.

i'd pick Dratini
after the main attraction of white forest/black city you beat someone

starting to get to that time of the day huh?
RAWR!
where no soul can be found
So... when Pinkie makes clones using the Mirror Pond or whatever... how will we know which one was the original pinkie when they try to solve the consequences of that decision? And does a clone have the right to live?

suddenly text wall!!
out of bucking nowhere! Mwahaha!
tl;dr, something about Pinkie clones
and then ded
CALL THAT A TEXT WALL?!
good job
remember now spoiler talk
no
why aren't you asleep
woop woop
/me is suprised no one has this name yet
You do realized no likes him, right?
shut up sombra, you disappointed me in the premiering episode
:(
why would anyone have it, he was the lamest villain so far
it was only me....
Sombra had a very scary presence, but when he finally appeared it was kind of anticlimactic.
he could have been awesome
What could have made him scary?
He was more of a "force" than a person.
Yeah
^
mica y u no op in first place
wait dw
sumica be around
Sumi, go to bread
and I wanted to know about the crystal ponies
He didn't have a personality, he had basically no lines and he had no reason to be evil. He was just that evil presence that had a face.
I like the crystal ponies. I'd like to see more of them. :>
playing sooooo bad
Crystal Rarity is best crystal poni
I imagine each of them named after gemstones like amethyst, lapis, lazuli and emerald
mica its 7 oclock....Do you know where your children are?
that would be awesome
How much of a person can survive being turned to shadow, though? Might be a consequence of his form. Everything is essentially dead except his resentment and hate?
Ninjazz yes ;)
an off screen evil is always the worst kind of evil
The thing is he didn't succeed in taking over the city like all the other villains did.
Chrystalis is the only real credible threat so far in the series
Chrysalis
stupid T
What do you guys and gals think is gonna happen next?
Stupid sexy Twilight. >.>
^YES
Aren't we not supposed to talk about future eps?
What if they actually did that?
Seems Discord has a higher threat potential than Chrysalis. He can do everything she can and more. He just CHOSE to do less harm than he could.
Obligatory barbers shop quartet http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06U3Z60_s6g
Gold_Demona Why not? :(
we arent supposed to talk about leaked info or spoilers
i meant like ideas or stuff :3
ah
How long is the spoiler rule for? 24 or 48 hours?
discord was just having fun, Chrysalis had real motivation and an army
Well, I've got some chores to do today, so I'm gonna go into lurk mode more a while.

Sunset: can't wait to see where this black magic leads
hmm
twilight is the transition between light and dark, and vice versa
Oh you people
trying to apply your fanceh logic and symbolism to a children's show
dumb character limit
lolz
AdamTheDuck: It's fun though to expect a little more than just a kids show :3
MLP? More than a kids show?
But only little girls watch MLP
If I saved the image, I could show the conspiracy theories on how Twlight is going to be the 3rd alicorn.
No, I'm just saying it's messed up that she intentionally (after being horrified by its effect on her mental state) steps out of the way, allows her friend to interact with it, and watches the effects in order to evaluate her theory about it. You'd think she'd warn him.
Imagine if full grown men actually watch My Little Pony >_>
Ahem
flstudio is give me a eye swore
I watched My Little Pony when I was like a baby.
Anyways Hello everybody :)
twilight thinks in a logical way though, so it isn't beyond her to test out a theory on spike

Here's how I think it should be.
this is why everyone hates us people
i also have a donut xD
Bronysith, not entirely true
It still saddens me that the only thing that the premier gave birth to was mediocre reviews and by far the worst meme I've ever seen.
GI wonder if this atriggers it
considering it has been over a year since skyrim and that stupid arrow meme was born
GI wonder if this atriggers itk
of course they had to find a new meme

Goodbye everypony - Oh, and incase I don't see you, Good Afternoon, Good Evening and Good Night :)
If that's the case, I wonder if other people will catch on. So far, it seems to be JUST a brony meme.
Sad as that is.
that's still a stupid rule
Kandarihu, good intentions.
Engi: what rule?
colours
lolz at the copy paste kick
I <3 Gak Free zone
Engi: not really. the colors are reserved for mods
^
wait
Gyrobowls.
wow
missed
its scripted
Bronysith: obviously, but the rule itself is silly
Engi: why? it counts as spam
It's just text :/
Engi, it's there to help people know the difference between regular users and the mods.
it is annoying
AS ALL CAPS
Bronysith, remember Fight Club?
Yeah
Everything here is just text. it's IRC!
Engi: you dont make the rules, so shut up
Multiplayer notepad.
Kandarihu: If they can't figure that out, why are they even on IRC
/me strips all colour codes anyway
the higher up have symbols like the @
and +
aniderp, not on every client.
Well Bronystate has a ebpage client for easy access for viewers
*webpage
most clients i have been to
two ducks walk into a chat
every client that is worth using allows one to easily tell who is opped or voiced
[1]DeadpoolDash: and i set them on fire
The thing is, it's a downgraded version of LightIRC.
mIRC right here
^
Engi have you been here on a episode night? it's crazy.
movies played
how many were on this last weekend for the episode?
I've been here since the S2 premiere.
how to train your dragon and then jetsons movie
Besides. This website uses an embedded client and it's usually referred to as "chat". For the people who aren't aware of IRC, the symbols in front of people's names means very little. And it could become pointlessly convoluted to expect them to learn the difference between Op, Half-Op, Voiced, and non-voiced.
i have know this place since season 2 finale when the router was dying then we got new one and i remember this place
the derp part was cause router connection was really dead so i stick to aniderp here
Because newfoals don't read the FAQ or the rules.
friggin newfoals
I think i've come by here prior to season 2
but i saw episode one of season three here before i went to store
http://i.imgur.com/PRlDi.jpg simple and clear

I think I've met you on CSS

Fluttershy was cute as phuck in the jousting scene.
lolz at rainboe guilting fluttershy into it
rainbow
Maybe it's a bit late to say this, but I found a Youtube video of the entire S3 premier, ads and all. There were only 6 ads for that which must not be named. And there were 3 consecutive ads for Floam. It was done the exact same way, but didn't result in nearly as much of a meme.
the floam didnt have the brainwashing effect of the other un-named product
It's the three phrase song.
It just. kept. getting. spammed.
Awww this place is so silent now
What's up?!
Man. I remember when I used to get on here everyday.
kbi
Ohai
Here's a fun word: atychiphobia

Fear of failure
So now we have a definition for RD's fear
Gelotophobia, Pinkie Pie

Fear of being laughed at

big words..

no wait
what am i saying, hes not gone
Bronystate never sleeps
o rly?
i brb
Choice Brushian is the correct answer
thx
so sad...
why?
clouds are gathering
Alright. I found a video of the entire S3 premier event without cutouts or editing out the commercials at all. I took notes of which ads ran at which times.
Kandarihu: why did you do that to yourself :D
Yes, you are right
MadSurge, somepony here said that it got 95% of the adtime, so I just want to prove that wrong.
Aaah
That which must not be named had a total of 8 total 0:15 spots, with 4 on each of the two parts.
Brushian: if you write out a user's nick exactly by the character, it pings
yep
furthermore, tab serves as an autocomplete button
Brushian: and you can use tabs to complete the name after you type in the first letters
yeah
so typing C and pressing tab multiple times should cycle through all the C usernicks alphabetically
^
Yay :(
no
Is there a yaying Fluttershy?
yay...
yay
Brushian, but if there are too many names to choose from, it will just give you a ful list of everyone on that list, and you can't cycle through names. That makes it troublesome whenever anyone's name begins with Pony, such as if they don't choose a nick and their nick is just pony_<random number>
I should pastebin this
taco bell is gooood
:(:'(:[ there is no yaying fluttershy. it makes me sad
Brushian: theres also no AJ, but you dont see people complaining about that
>_><_<
Applejack.
no celestia is the greater travisty
dinkydoo: hi
oh im not on the site client
did they add that?

No stream right now DinkyDoo
DashWithRainbows: ...just asking becuuse no video showing...
Oh.
Don't listen to doshwifreenblows
Moderators will stream when they want to
I think Rarity is a strange character.
he's full of shet
Excluding BMN, Euroshow and live episodes.
oh...
Jmo: he said I'm not british ;_;
Which fan-fic is worse: The Rainbow Factory or Cupcakes?
O:
/me huggles Sylandest
Cupcakes
u r british
Cupcakes is horribly written, so it is worse.
/me huggles Jmo back ;-;
Brushian: she's a very peculiar character for cartoons :D
Cupcakes.
RAISE YOUR HOOF IF YOU'VE READ CUPCAKES BEFORE AND HATED IT.
Either way, both stories are overrated.
Sorry, I don't have a hoof.
/me Facehoofs
DinkyDoo: don't talk about the nameless fic :D
THEN USE YOUR HAND.
Nah
/me Uses unicorn magic to make raise hand
I'M A UNICORN C:
I have no intention to read those fics
Also keep the roleplay to a minimum, please
:P
MadSurge: On the begining I couldn't understand why there are Twilight, Spike and Rarity.. What role do they play? Excuse me for my english
ahh comon MadSurge u should at least read cupcakes. it has quite a funny ending
HAHAHAHAHAno.
Naturesfury: It has MULTIPLE endings..
Wut?
Theres one where Derpy saved Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie gets arrested.
...sigh.
Theres one when Pinkie Pie gives her friends the cupcakes made of Rainbow Dash..
naturesfury: but I hate Pinkie being a murderous nutcase :(
Don't we all..
Apparently not.
Just don't go to my shed... :'(
Pinkie is mostly harmless even when furious

MadSurge: XD oh my god

Feel like I'm looking at modern art.
RARITY IS WORST PONY

Lololol random emote
Just like your life then, Joomay
I agree with kp7733.
Killerpony7733: *EveryPONY
^Correction i mean't to say no pony
You're restricting it to only ponies
I dislike that.
O:
You must hate the other species
Therefore, I hate you

Who did you say that?
[PMU
I wanna choose a bronynick. Is my nick acceptable?

Hi everybody.
Hi Meanwhile
Sure is dead in here.
yep
Hey Meanwhile. Yes, ain't it great?
is it possible to understand by my nick that I'm from Russia and i'm a brony?
Or that you've got a thing for brushes.
oh..
Oh mai
Brushian Sounds more like prussian to me.
^
Ohai Meanwhile!
killerpony7733: thx
so im guessing that most of the guys are at work or sleeping or what
halo 4 >.>
Meanwhile: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/aee5d16bc817616861cd453e84a5716e.png How did this happen O_o
MadSurge: Pinkie Pie. 'Nough said.
MadSurge: its like oppisite day o.0
Is it original if i nicknamed as "kazbro"? kaz - because i live in kazan
Meanwhile: Exactly :D
Brushian Well it's more that if it really feels like it fits you then take that username
Kazbro sounds like a knockoff of Casper.
Kazbro the friendly ghost.
im going to go make some waffles and watch some MLP episodes on my xbox elite here so yeah
If a lawsuit waiting to happen from Hasbro.
you arent going to get a response that isnt snarky here
It's because Angle land is awake.
thanks for participating! let me think about it more
In the land of Angles snark is the currency and Simon Cowell is king.
/me Yawns
Happy sickness season!
Gyrobowl save the queen.
we are all obtuse angles here
So how about that gak?
How about i sing you a lullaby? :S
Is Gyrobowl gonna become a meme?
Pfft.
Yup. We got tired of it.
Where is da scootaloo? so sad...
How can you get tired of g.ak
is asking if X is going to be a meme going to be a meme?
Oh you know, when it gets spammed 1000 times in chat. Not even joking.
In like, under a minute.
You probably had to be paying attention to one of the rooms full of derp to notice that, but yeah I can imagine.
What will be the cutiemark of Scootaloo?
A KFC bucket.
waffles
Scootaloo's cutie mark should be a scooter.
Ninjazz|Busy: ask mods for a chat log from Saturday and parse them to get the actual count
Sweetie Bell's should be a music note.
taco
BUT WHAT IN THE HAY IS APPLEBLOOM'S GONNA BE
prius
Lemons.
Even if it was just 150 people, all you could see is gark gark gark, karg karg karg. And NullRadix, I don't think my computer screen is big enough to contain the number.
So nothnx.
..so bored...
You know what? GAK.
One does not simply g.ak into mordor.
There is the one question that makes me insomnious. What are pigs in ponivile?
Kag Kag Kag
They're pigs. That live in Poniville.
Wait, so the mods have made the bots kick you when you say "Gak"?
http://i1099.photobucket.com/albums/g383/Vermic/weenie.png uuuuum, Pinkie, watch your language
No shit sherlock.
Well, Sumi's has anyway. Like when fight club was on.
Well, I don't pay attention too much to this chat, Joomay
Yes DoshWithDoshbows. Come episode nights, the ground will run red with blood.
Lawls
Can't wait
Ikr.
^^
Why is there need of pigs in ponyville?
Fertiliser?
Exactly my thought...
Brushian: truffles
pony_1230 Use /nick to give yourself a nickname
Pigs... could be trash "compactors" ?
It makes it easier to refer to you.
MadSurge: yeah. it seems to be true.
If Cedric from Harry Potter didn't die, we wouldn't have the horrible sparkling fairy-Vampire edward we have today.
Now I can sleep well
Brushian: also yeah, fertilizers and trash disposing. Pigs eat a lot of unwanted leftovers
/me goes to sleep
[]DeadpoolDash|Zzz: goodnight then :)
Time turner = Time turner.
How very redundant.
How do you think cider is an alcoholic drink?
Time Turner = Doctor Whooves.
Well depending on where you live cider has alcohol in it.
^
In certain parts of the world, cider is used to mean alcoholic apple drink
CIDER HAS ALCOHOL IN IT?!
If I live in Poniville?
If I went out and bought cider it'd probably be alcoholic.
DinkyDoo: some types of cider have it, yes
DinkyDoo: In the us no. Unless its hard cider
MadSurge: ....Oh.
Ponyville is a fictional place inhabited by technicolour talking horses, best not to concern yourself with physics in such a place.
Apple cider in Poniville is an alcoholic? How do you think?
Meanwhile well horses can tolerate quite a bit of alcohol so if it did then it probably wouldn't get them drunk
I know I have horses in my pasture
However only alcoholic cider will foam as far as i know.
Actually, there was a fun fact thing. If cider foams, it is alchoholic.
Geh....
And you...just let the horses have the occasional keg?
The cider in that episode foamed
Ninjazz|Busy, you foam.
Floam.
Hi guys I'm finally back....
you flaom jaymoo.
Poem.
Ohai SpadeMagnes[School]!
My cruise sucked....
What a shame.........
howdy SpadeMagnes[School]
its back back back
/nick Punkie_Pue
It was fun to start then one of my luggage carriers got stolen
Meanwhile: apparently horses love beer
whiskey for my men beer for my horses
Who doesn't love beer?
Me.
<-
Beer tastes like piss.
<--
I don't drink beer.
Well meanwhile you hate everything
I stand corrected.
So thats a given
Meanwhile: agreed
Ponies in Poniville are not horses. They are weird mutants as I think. :O
I drink spirits when I can. Beer tastes like ass.
Meanwhile what kind of skunk-plot Shite are you drinkin'?
OMG I FOUND A WAY TO CHARGE MY LAPTOP WHILE ON MY BED O_O
I like Sam Adams
I didn't know the wire could reach that far..
Given that to date I've hated just about ever form of alcohol I've ever tried, take your pick because it's probably that.
Meanwhile: Bayley's?
I like wine though
Beer can shove off, wine can shove off, lager can shove off, gin can shove off, rum can shove off, vodka can shove off.
I like da Batman
Mead can shove off.
i like nickelodeon goo..
Meanwhile don't shove off vodka. cheap vodka is a good disinfectant
^
It also tastes like nail polish.
kyga
Denatured alcohol is cheaper than cheap vodka
Beer in russia completely sucks
Sometimes, it's not about the taste. It's about how fast you can get drunk off the stuff.
Meanwhile: it's also great to awaken people who fainted :D
since when did we start talking about alcholic beverages?
Meanwhile What about Whiskey?
haseo348: because cider
Shove off.
oh...
haseo348: applecider
Meanwhile thats because both vodka and and nail polish both have acytate
ohhhhh
vodka
...
vodka has acytate?

MadSurge: I'm English. Tea. Tea everywhere.
Tea Represent.
/me loves sweet tea
Meanwhile: oh right :P Enjoy your crumpets too
Don't like crumpet.
Madsurge: Is tea good?
Im not really a fan of tea that much
Keep calm and drink tea!
I friggin' love tea :3
Arnold Palmer is good
I can show you sweet tea Syl.
FAWKING LETS WATCH SOME HORSES.
<.>
Let's not.
Only if the mods want to, haseo348
-_-
Let's get some LPS in here.
Meanwhile: how about music? Do you like any genre?
Pretty much.
Before MLP did Applejack have any other meaning than the liquor?
Have you forgotten that Meanwhile is the British equivalent of Francis, MadSurge?
I hate vampires.
Sparkle sparkle.
Ninjazz|Busy: nope :D
Punkie_Pue: I think it is some kind of cereal
MLP_Brovakiin: I forgot about that.
'Lo bronystate
Meanwhile hates mountains, lakes, cities and alcohole
Does anypony here like Gangnam Style..
No.
Hai Hoody|Skool :)
Ohai Hoody|Skool!
Hi Hoody|Skool

DinkyDoo: wait to see all the variants the mods found :D
MadSurge: Variants?

Here I was sitting and wondering if you were a Trekky.
>_>
THERE ARE BRONIES HERE?!?

You mean this isn't the Trekky chat?
my cousin Brooklyn_Brony told me about this
Supposively not.

Shame.
I didn't know supposively was a word. :D
Meanwhile: I don't think this would be a trekkie chat with emotes like this: :$

It's my own word, you got a problem?
he told me about AJIsAwesome and thelonepony and others
Yes. :3
yay :3
I thought that was Spock ;)
Given that I don't have emoticons on my client, that example is irrelevant.
Take it up with the I don't give a shit department.

Jmo: :D
is there a stream because he told me there is a stream?
hehe stream.
no stream atm
Meanwhile: Darn! foiled again by the interwebs!

Tomorrow black ops 2 is coming out tomorrow so im getting it NukeTown 24/7 i guess so yeah
All the mods play TF2. that's not exactly a peaceful and tranquil activity.
i just heard of this one guy, a german community head, that seems to thing the 2 new eps were the worst in the whole show
I kinda prefer Runic Potions. (Shameless WoW Plug)

0,5"Tomorrow black ops 2 is coming out tomorrow"
how do people get to that
hi
yup
mfw i thought Nyra was Nyria for a sec
He has issues Elsie.

0,5Mutterguy: I don't play TF2
i guess yeah
0,5I don't play PC games at all
Cause you're bad at them Elsie.

Baconmane will be in the future, i still getting my ass kicked by BaconMane
and thats why im getting it
a man who played with controllers his whole life will horribly fail at a mouse controlled shooter, jsut as any lifelong pc gamer will horribly fail at their first controller
are you new here PurpleSparkles?
tl;dr
TrixieTheMagnificent: that sounds like Snow, she does that xD
I love how you said 'man'
though, i bet if you had a crossplatform match, the mouse guys would win
a lot
Hey PurpleSparkles
but that's just my theory
Women don't play games according to this guy.
someone needs to test it
egads.
Hey BaconMane are you getting black ops or no for tomorrow?
i play games jaymoo
Dark_Horst: or you could just fucking adapt to any controller and or pc keyboard given to you

i have MLP_Brovakiin i wanted to know what happened to her
alexxm: Oh, my bad
boy, you know what the most annoying thing about this Pandemic 2 game?
When you finally get Madagascar
only to have Mexico be clear of everything
Buytoast, I won 2 times of about 20 times playing ^^
I don't like Madagascar in that game
hello brony world im back
I'm not sure anyone likes Madagascar in that game.
Quick test to see if this is still in effect: gak
"Madagascar, why won't you die?!"
All right. I'm an editor for that Know Your Meme and I'm going to add that talk of that is barred from here
oh, played a game similar to Pandemic II in
Was just double checking to see if the kick was still in place
J_E_Smith71: Be sure to add that we support the lord God gyrobowl.
seriously talk of that advert is kikable>
wheel ooze a whole BUch W.O.A.H bunch
smooze is better
I'm alright, feeling a bit out of it... Not sure if I'm getting sick or what.
oh :(
(^▼^)
｡◕‿◕｡
hope you feel better
this is such a pain
....okay so, hope in Episode 7 is slowly fading already
cya later everyone
what's wrong?
why in the hell is Mexico suddenly the last bastion of humanity
they aren't even an island
CriticKitten: Episode 7?
Buytoast: idk
I was getting all hyped up when they said that they assigned the writer of Toy Story 3 to write Star Wars's new script, because the guy's a good writer.
CriticKitten: Really? :O
But then I read that apparently Vader is coming back in Ep 7.
CriticKitten: Isn't it planned to be out by 2013/14?
What?
....yes, you read that correctly. Vader is in Ep 7 apparently.
anyone from japan here
I thought he died.
He did.
" While Vader seemingly met his end in the 1983 film The Return Of The Jedi it seems this will not stop his comeback. "This is science fiction remember," we're told. "Darth Vader will rise from the ashes." "
they might do flashbacks or something
Mods are asleep?
I think they're lurking. :D

Kay.
Clones. it'll be clones
You know what to do.
twilight_sprinkle: But here's my question: WHY?
Post the G...
Mfw all the G- kicks next week :D
anyone?
You just bought the franchise and have a chance to establish a brand new slate, make your name in the series, and you....instead decide to resurrect a dead character who was beaten half to death in the prequels.
CriticKitten: well in the books theres mara, she was vaders apprentice iirc. flashback generally dont fir in such movies though
i dont get why though
13is dari still streaming or did he forget to update queue
there's only the buffer
the it was just an advert
i don't think there is a steam
Only the buffer, Shizu. :)
Huh, I only streamed for about 10 minutes
Whoops
where's Russia?
twilight_sprinkle: >implying they'll acknowledge the EU

Hi, AppleBloom. :)
Hi aniderp :3

SeaponiesofLiverpool: that word is now forbidden on this chat
hi AppleBloom
^^
It's getting late.
I'm back from a very, very, VERY long BRB..
Ohai AppleBloom!
YES
Wut
good call there FluffySurge
Hey, Shizuka!
Shizuka stream :3
SHIZUSTREAM <3
Oh hai Shizuka stream
Streaming something?
shizu stream
Yay, Shizu stream. :)
what if Celestia's hair was Gka
Science stream?
FluffySurge: The word that should never be spoken O_O
^
Thanks for stream Shizu
i have a theory as to why japanese men like mlp
You know the stream will be badass when the mod has her own signature video.
So yeah, hoping that's a rumor and not true.
Uh, this again
:o
mmm, time for some sexy Sagan serenades
13fun fact
13we will get to making a universe from scratch today
... What's streaming?
yay!?
God damnit, Carl Sagan right when I was going to bed.
Part 8? I missed a bit it seems
Yay :3
yay stream
i freaking love docs! :D
Assassin's Creed sequence 13 1-2-3
^^
raaa?
My bosses told me they were "just talking about me" but didn't say why
D:
Witch of Space and Knight of Time
what god tier would Carl Sagan be?
Shizuka: are you a scientist? Or just passionate about it?
star
oh good somethings streaming...
Derpy would be the Maid of Muffins
milky way galaxy
Is there a problem, haseo348?
hi
13nice hair today carl
lol sand
Hi pony_3309.
sandddd
13wake up on the wrong side of the universe today?
no no i was just saying because i was
My hair is always like that :/
Shizuka: its that sea wind it messes all the hair up
s
Milky Way GAlaKxy
waiting since 9:00 am
gaara lol
...
ohai pony_3309!
lol
Hi pony_3309 :)
Shizuka: also, please elaborate on the new universe thing :)
naked eye
gak , lol nope
see what I did thar: Milky Way GAlaKxy
We can't see distant ones because of the red shift
/me loses the fluff
red shirts?
Im sorry
I wont happen , peace !
follow the dots
dont worry
my inglish is bad :c
amazing :D
That's one of those phrases which can go either way.
pony_3309 this is the place you can polish it
if you do that again, you'll get a Minute ban so no biggie
^^
Carl saGAnK
Red shift. Because of the doppler effect, distant stars' emitted light are reduced in frequency to infrared, invisible to the naked eye
no one want to hear my theory
what is this?
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Stop it >:U
no big dipper? D:
Ok , thanks
what are they streaming?
docs
haseo348: a Carl Sagan documentary
this ismadness
ah
whale
Nagas Larc?
oh hell I thought someone had hacked my MC then I realised that i left the sound on on the stream :D :D :D
science, my fellow bronies :)
00,10Thought some one was playing with a Vertex game system for a moment
Is this show a famous Monty Python which I have heard a lot?
lolwut ?
lol a tie with a shark face..
=))))
Carl Sagan is making a funny face
he's not moving
stars evolve?
like pokemon do
yes
lol
fire flies
Stars are living things
only a few millions years?
hm just a few million years
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates: November 12 - Afternoon
its to do with bpa and mercry runing into the china sea and entering the japanese food supply
you star is evolving *cues pokemon evolving theme*
its like the Gaia theory.... but applied to stars
look at the sky and see
PRESS B
b
im just a poor boy
/me presses b
dont eveolve star i like you ;_;
Press B or your star evolves into a supernova!
u averted "Sun" from evolving into a Supernova
congratulations your star evolved into a supernova
LOL
that hivemind
i pressed b ;_;
/me 13still doesn't get constellations
you are now ded
he in space
Stars are alive
He's a part of the night sky
13there's too much fuzz
like the Gaia theory
Shizuka, they were for the naviagtion at sea
His hair is better nao
and aalchemy
astromony class!
man
13but how do you actually see a picture as detailed as they always are
carl sagan is ded nao octavia
loved astronomy class
13like the alternate big dippers he showed
I'm training to be an astronaut
13how do you get a horse from a straight line
yay
you dont?
suddenly, I have the urge to study astronomy
connect the dots dude... connect the dots
epmty
did it freeze for anybody else?
Shizuka: ancient people had more fantasy than us I think
got it dude
yes
the space is boring , lol
so much numbers
Shizuka, they had very much time and too less work
for me he's pursing his lips... wearing a brown jacket with blue sweater
spiral power is real carl sagan said so
nicely evolving
its dark... looks like it is lit by a fire
Wait
so..
2 million years ago
we evolved
They could do nothing at night, so they looked at the sky a lot
alexxm beware of the anti-spiral
then we can have GL? :o ?
due to the bpa in paticular japanese men get mor femanine evry genaration
xD
what human forms is he talking about
yes aniderp
cavemen
cavemen...humans
but
2 million years ago?
11,01Hi.
the funny thing is .... all this science does not refute god.
so nice to think of looking at the sky as looking millions to billions of years in the past
hi Nittany_Discord
ohai Nittany_Discord
we were more like monkeys millsions years ago
hai Nittany_Discord :3
Hello Nittany_Discord :)
apes
Hai Nittany_Discord :3
cavemen
it just says: GOD did it THIS way
Hi Nittany_Discord :)
SeaponiesofLiverpool, the higgs boson is very close to that hough :P
instead of THAT other way
Hi Nittany_Discord :)
pony
Hello, Nittany_Discord. :)
nooo
dont whipe it D:
Hey Nittany_Discord.

God= Universe/multiverse consciousness
Hey, Shizuka....Lunac and i had an idea.....(insert Spongebob/rarity reference here) The thing is that he wants to riff the Jetsons movie and i agreed. He/she wanted me to ask you, since she/he's not here
lol dat music
german ...
Hi Nittany_Discord !
son I am soooo disapoint
dat bike
I've had to play this piece for countless weddings
einstien
Nailed it.
oboi what a twist
HE WAS SWISS!
...
mothabucking Einstein
What is your worst fear?
Eli: Try again
yeah but born in germany Eli :)
german
dappled and rippling
/me forgot's that he/she is not supposed to link video's during stream
DinkyDoo: Tacos becoming non-existaint... :(
My worst fear is...
Cupcakes.. o_o
11,01He/she?
Cupcakes are tasty though c:
Hermaphrodite?
/me noms cupcakes
something funny happens? I guess you are being torn apart at that speed
11,01flutterchu has r63 powers.
I'm afraid of the FAN-FIC cupcakes.
just got on... WHAT IS THIS!
he playing in the water!
mass can't go at c
<-- WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT
flutterfan99: science
oh
what about dark?
Oh..
Bill Nye before Bill Nye
what is this science you speak of?
TROctavia, wrong. just things with dead weight ^^
havent you read the Rules DinkyDoo
well I assume you don't do stupid things at work so I wouldn't worry about it
DinkyDoo: stars and space
no wait...
omg
shit
he gonna fall
Thelonepony: I forgot to read it..
Invi: What?
PONY NO
DinkyDoo: Read the rules and FAQ :)
Okay.
:)
screw Ulm. i claim Einstein for Switzerland.
SCIENCE
TROctavia, just things that have a weight when not moving can't go at c. things that stop exsisting when stop moving are able to.
paradox
special theory
11,01Objects don't stop existing. They just take an infinite amount of energy to get to c.
YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
is the my little pony game on andriod any good?
Invi: what sagan just said
Lord of the rings refrence?
this is educational
^
no
dont whip the pony ;_;
sonic boom?
He went to my school... well didn't know that
TROctavia, but Photons have mass
super sonic airplane
boom goes the whip
whip it
sonic rainboom
whip it good
I can't sleep well because of one question. Is it save in USA or in our country to download cracked share-ware content or new movies without any blame? Does government trace your IP and give punishment? Plz reply in the name of Celestia<3
OMG
Invi: Who says? photons are just energy
the government is always tracking your computer
no shit
Eli: he went to my school too :)
and they will areest you if you break the interenet laws
cyber police
so there reading all the fanfic's I red?
TROctavia yeah... and since E = mc² mass too ^^
they found out i pirated 3$ of music
shana: ETH?
lol
even all the thing's a searched up on google
Buytoast: So true >_>
?
Eli: eyup
<_<
13Fat: by just talking about it you've now been targeted by an orbital strike
13can i have your tv?
-_-
shana: sweet! you're smart :P
i want to ride my bicicle (8)
shi lol thats funny
xD thanks Eli
11,01Fat: It won't be safe much longer.
I don't have a bicycle :/
but
shana: but I mean the Kantonsschule Aarau :$
pinkie pie can break the fourth wall
there can be no safety
not true, Invi. The full equation is E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2.
so can deadpool
i want a bicycle :(
not in this world
Shizuka: No, but you can take...all of my money. [gives wallet, which opens another wallet in a wallet from a wallet]
and dash can break the speed of light
i do.........but my freind stole it :'(
bicycle , bicycle (8)
i want to ride my bycycle
Oh very funny Shizuka. Call the fire itself! I hope i have no liquid tiberium under my house
TROctavia, what is pc?
13joke's on you
nigga stole my bike lol
Eli: neat, 3 nobel prize winner from that school :)
o..o
13downloading torrent software also downloads liquid tiberium to your hard drive
13in short you're hosed
Invi, it is momentum x c. check minute physics. they explain it perfectly
in the end, we're all owned by those who controll us
i heard that there going to name an island Equestria
Doubt it.
shana: doesn't have much to do with the school believe me. and aren't there eleven from the ETH?
TROctavia, oh you mean impulse. yeah. photons have that too ^^
Flutterchu: That would be awesome, but I don't think it would happen..
>_>
TROctavia because everything that moves and has mass has an impulse
All of this illegal stuff going on in the chatroom is making me nervous, really nervous. Really. Really. Nervous.

http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/18.381197-The-Island-of-Equestria-Project
he an avatar monkey thing now
:o
Invi, photons don't have mass. they just have wave/particle dualities
VenHur: You should expect sirens in a couple of minutes...
:3
Listen to the vid
wtf are we watching?
flutterchu, the campaign expired
TROctavia, they have no dead mass but moving mass
old man
No non-image links, flutterchu.
its very cool, ive seen it b4
it's not relevent anymore
invisible
AJIsAwesome: i know
MLP_BRovakiin: I SURRENDER! I SURRENDER! I SURRENDER!!
Then why did you post it?
holy shit pablo slow down, you're going to tear that asphalt apart
amazing O.O
Eli: don't know, some of them were probably just professors there
BRB...
biological clocks?
I don't need to move at speed of light. I can take drugs to achieve this
doggie
Invi: What do you mean by moving mass? Because a photon is nothing more than a wave of electromagnetic energy
oh the plan failed........well that's...............good?
Well, damn
age slowly?
if you think this is interesting google "A slower speed of light"
and died
wut
how sad.
younger brother
;_;
lol
look what you've done pablo
his friends died ;_;
13oh and they have proven that btw, they sent one of a pair of clocks at high speed, it was in fact slower than the stationary one
his brother is olddd
T-T
;^;
so, travelling at the speed of light is equal to time travel
this is the damn first time a documentation brought a tear to my eye..damnit!
MEOW!
o_o
13future travel yes, he'll get into that
this is a documentary??? wtf???
exlixer of life
I find it interesting that any movement at all alters the rate at which time moves
human's need a sense
13>leonardo da vinci
art guy
oh da vinci
aniderp: nope. you don't get younger. time seems the same to you
13>climinbg these hills
13yep he was an assassin
ohh
dat character from AC?
Da Vinci's Creed?
00,02Leonardo taught etzio everything he knew
DA AJIsAwesome's Creed :3
Michael: no the guy with the smile fetish
you mean ezio
thelonepony's Creed. :D
0,5But leonardo was an artist ololol
13no he means halle berry
13pay attention
lmao
0,5i so smart
Leonardo was so much more than an artist
BaconMane: yeah. he drew nice things. like the motorboat
leonardo you crazy bastard, you're not a bird, you cant fly
fuck my sgt!
you silly silly man
0,5brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrerbrbrbrb
and the helicopter and stuff
heueheueheu
13he built only one flying machine, it promptly crashed in venice
13or was it florence
also the egiptians predicted the tank
shes making me write a 1000 word essay on the importance of maintaining ones TA=50
this documentary is so sad :/
Thanks them who replied me. I dThanks to those who answered me. I don't want to leave my country despite annoying advertising on this stream to become a U.S. citizen. <_<
the wright brothers dveloped the flying mechanism
13Fat: learn to adblock
Thanks those *
so instead, im going to take her on teh move rambling, convoluted trip into madness
he drew and wrote over 7000 pages of ideas.
wait.. im right or wrong?
so confusing
/me derp
It had to be done http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352733226383.jpg
13aniderp: the wright brothers got the first one to stay in the air
im confusing myself
aniderp: they invented the first plane. but i think there were "flight machines" before
lol
TROctavia, can't find my old physics stuff from school. but you can also calculate the mass of a photon at a certain energy level with E0pc 0 hv. v is frequency while h is the Planck action quantum(not sure if right translation ^^)
Shizuka: thanks.
*E = pc = hv
Why the hell would someone claims an uncharted island for 600K and names it after a kid's show?!
really, once we get a space elevator completed, this would be sooo much better
Crazy. I freakin' know.
whats streaming after this?
also, provided the explosions to destroy the ship
Deadalus?
does anyone know?
11,01It would be an epic construction project.
wtf is with my word usage? im not even that drunk yet!
make it happen
whatever Shizuka wants to stream
132012, still no fusion, sagain you wrong
Invi, oh, i know what you mean. But i never saw v as frequency, it was always a fancy "f"
E = hf
Nittany_Discord: I don't know, the whole island thing is a scam to me.
Rose`Wine: smart name right? that is bound to crash
well he said 'just a few million years' ago, who knows what soon means to him :)
h is the planck constant
11,01I meant the space elevator.
shizuka: if i may ask whats streaming after this o.o?
Oh.
13stuff
TROctavia, sorry that i have no ny on my keyboard ^^
i think the Human speed limit is supposed tobe 1/3 C. Too much radiation otherwise
00,10whys this guy got catapilers on his face?
Yeah, I guess the space elevator could be nice...
building a sentry...
13it's not caterpillars
Invi: It's all good lol
13it's BILLIONS AND BILLIONS of hairs :3
just stabalizing the pillar for the space elevator long enough to attach a geosyncronious orbittal platfor, the ammount of force and materials needed
my lord
Shizuka: or just thousands
psh billions
Is this narrator a british man?
cant be
then they'll be fried
or rather, nonbritish
lazor!

MAH lazor
13star trek is way ahead of you there sagan
blargg
what trickery is this?
00,10it's a bussard scoop
Shizuka: it looks like the deflector dish on a starship
lots

unobtainium is best mineral name.
who wants to travel into the futurte anyways? the future sucks ^^
slingshot around the sun at warp 9
Rose`Wine: it's so terrible amirite :D
13oh also
13this was made before back to the future

/me never saw Back to the Future
No Delorean jokes? D:
RaveBrony: Same. ;$
*:$
naruto's clones
Maybe ponies inhabit one of those dimensions
Never saw the first Back To The Future
i think humans were never intended to think this far...
Eli: we think as far as we like! :D
Eli: I don't think nature intended anything
^
Problem is we humans want to control everything we can
fire, water, and courage
nature is intending to destroy everything ^^
Time and space is kinda something you'd not want to mess with
sounds like legend of zelda

Google?
GOOGLE EXIST BAC KTHEN?
TROctavia: no 1+1=fish
2 + 2 = Fish.
Verspa: because, science
Science...
Googol... Sounds familiar...
gogol
Google was originaly called Googol
gogol pls
golgoo
scout19_tf2: 1 + 1 is alternatively window, not fish
golgoo pls
i thought it was called louggle
But something screwed them up so they renamed it to googple
google
oogle
TROctavia: its a joke:D
I think the main purpose of this video is that if you know how to do math, you can afford every thing he has.
If its that big
It looks like crap.
nerds rule the world ^_^
For real, just look at it
Then he TPd Versailles.
Doesn feel like a real number
what's a real number Verspa?
It isnt
13btw when he says it can't fit in the universe
I dont know
13they proved that even assuming the smallest possible font
13for 1 and 0
wow planetside is really fun
13it still can't fit
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0

A googol is the large number 10100; that is, the digit 1 followed by 100 zeroes:10,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000.

>__
>_<
CrimsonPhoenix: It makes perfect sense. :D
^
>_><_<>_><_<>_><_<
Of course :D
baby stars :)
Educational videos are scary.
It makes you realize how small you are... in comparison to the universe.
Educational videos are good, all the cool kids are doing them
And if you watch the Science Channel..
half the specials inevitably discuss the end of life as we know it
kind of depressing
MLP_Brovakiin: No they aren't, didn't you notice Squarepants died when he watched Education video, GOOD MESSAGE SHOW
^
point taken :D
:D
Yay my favorite show -_-
apparently indian music = aliens
it killed spongebob before his show started sucking :\
everything=aliens
What the hell is a red poker

Does anyone know where i can find the full image of this --> :) <--
Rite of Spring!

i think the reason for it being mostly space on tv, is that its more fantasy than numbers
Oh, how do you NOT know this?

Wait.. why is a brony chat room streaming carl sagan? I'm quite alright with it, but it just seems odd.
TROctavia: because Shizuka likes science
carl sagan? wat...
TROctavia: Education
Why not? :3
TROctavia: Because some bronies like science :3
11,01We're not 24/7 ponies.
oh this carl sagan :P
we do stream a lot of non pony stuff here TROctavia :)
In this area of the internet, we have IQ increasing methods
TROctavia: and this is not ponies 24/7 station, the mods stream whatever they like
TROctavia: http://i.imgur.com/vwpXF.gif
This causes these bronies within this area to behave, educate, and manners.
Will Ponies be streamed today?
How is that bad?
thelonepony: :D
Oh, i'm entertained quite a lot.
RarityIsCool: maybe later
Good
:3
And I know its not 24/7, but i havent seen any pony at all since the premiere
TROctavia: BMN
^
and if you ask for ponies *gulp*
TROctavia: be careful, you might get G3 ponies with that kind of talk
and none of "that" which shall not be spoke, either
Penetrating my body? Y u do dis uranium?
Vordox: Is that a Daily Show reference
is immune to cosmic rays
you dont want to know TROctavia :(
TROctavia: Brony Movie Night

Because only boring people don't like music
Nice link.........
that wall :D
Hey
Dat link.
ow,, heavy link is long
x.x dat link
spam
RarityIsCool, please link a shorter link next time
RarityIsCool i recomend a link shortner
RarityIsCool: use a link shortener next time
with just one post, you spam the entier room
beat you to it RarityIsCool
I'm sorry, i didn't know it was that long.
and it's a trojan apparently

nice
Oh
Raritay: http://derpy.me/ <--- This site is for you
Vordox, wrong one
Thank you.
phone lines are down :/ cant use the internet at home
fluffle_puff: beat you to it
not enough Derp
i beat*
Oh dear.
:P
phone lines?
oh wait fluffle_puff to CrimsonPhoenix's comment? :D
Do you use dial up?
Crab Nebula http://derpy.me/kwxS-
for*
lol
LAN line for the house
no, dsl
Why would you send a god damn link with a trojan in it?
DSL is also reliant on phone lines.
AJIsAwesome: you missed my stream today :c
oh and hi everpony ^^
:D
oh
yep
Hai Sonny :)
hi, Sonny
I did? Dang it, Sonny. :(
It has trojan?
<---- So...like a reactor?
Oh sorry.
Pulsars....cool
RarityIsCool My anti virus says very much yes
Hi Sonny :), wait, did i miss your stream :(
Sonny: Sorry about that.
AJIsAwesome: I drew solrac from yaplap today and another commission :p
I've never used internet that was reliant on phone lines
thelonepony: just a part ^^ don't worry
Cool
I didn't even know there was a diffence between DSL and dial-up
ball up the tushie
ok I'm gonna tell you all now

Sonny: you mean screamo guy :P
hell of a way to die
Goodnight everyone, take care :)

I'm sad it's ending.
Vordox: Ha :D
Notice the :( afterwards
Raritay: what's ending?
ahhhh XD

I love this part!
that sounds horrible

Mica trolling thats a paddling
Vordox: Do explain, in lower case
http://www.startrek.com/boards-topic/33351139/my-little-pony-freindship-is-magic
This video is becoming slightly trippy...
If by that definition, the energy, or the atoms or whatever, would be "throw" into the other universe, HOWEVER; have we found any "Mass generation" in our universe that can prove this?
what if

Hai Nitt
doing well, my birthday is today and you yellowsnow? :)
Vordox: They note that gamma rays do escape from the black holes, so it could quite possibly be matter converted to energy coming from another area in space and time
how was it? :3
Happy birthday thelonepony
thanks :)
np :)
Happy birthday thelonepony <3
the simpler days of the internet
TROctavia: Still does not explain my thesisI just made.
:O This calls for a Party!
TROctavia: Is there any "Mass generation" from other universe into our universe?
Anyone know where this is from ---> :) <---
Gamma Ray is a part, howeve,r it's wave energy, not mass or anything.
Vordox: I said that perhaps the gamma rays on our side used to be mass on the other side.
I want to make so much animations fan fics and music of mlp for some reason °-°
6/9
TROctavia: How odd...
lol
Hey who thinks that Alchemy(Transmutation) is possable?
TROctavia: It's a good thesis, I got to admit, they did say that it had high Gamma Radiation.
Aaaand dinner!
Vordox: for some time it has been theorized that there's a white hole in the center of the milky way. dont know if they still hold to that
RarityIsCool Small horses that i am entitled to
Vordox: Indeed. Black holes are quite strange
TROctavia: But... that's kinda an impossible number, hmm
Vordox: gamma rays are light, it has mass.
Zippoman924: i dont know what that iz
Space: The Final Froniter
i had to send my little pony to the glue factory :(
But yeah, I grew up around technology. First OS I ever used was MS-DOS with Windows 3.1.
11,01Hey Vordox.
Zippoman924: what do you mean? alchemy was a real thing, and yes you can turn one element into another..
twilight_sprinkle: I know, but how much is the mass~Gamma Ray ratio?
Hai Nitt?
yellowsnow: dont wrry...he can be the glue pony...how cute ;)
my dad was the computer person in my house.
I mean being able to turn a big amount of iron into a small amount of gold for exaple
Vordox: what ratio? you mean how much mass per one photon? i dont know, google it
Vordox: I think the ratio is irrelevant because not all of the energy escapes
I think the number would be too much. :P
<,<
>,>
He always did everything so no one else ever learned
It combines "magic" with chemistry
>_>
<_<
SuperBrony64:.
11,01A gamma ray is 500-something electron volts. It's the same rest energy as a positron or electron.
alchemists beleived they could turn one element into another, compeltely without chemical science
so... i hear that a certain word has been banned here... that is funny
magistry
11,01I think 518 eV.
... That's ONE electron, Nitt? O.o
11,01Yep.
when they noticed that that was bullshit, they pretended to create gold
by condensing quicksilver fo example
broke his leg so we had to get the shotgun poor my little pony
Both my parents had been working with computers since the days of the huge room sized computers.
I joined a forum when I was in high school and had to figure out every little basic thing for myself
my first real OS was winME
11,01511 eV
TROctavia: Still,there's the issue of being throw.. Or unless the mass gravity causes a "blender" of universe, where only the matters that leave from the Black Hole is pure gamma ray
I still think it is possable it just hasen't been figured out yet.
i see talk of science...
Vordox: Oh, anything near a black hole will be crushed completely.
A city on top of the galaxy or A Restraunt At the end of the galaxy. ;) lol
Say it 2 more times....
my brain does not want
ironically, they died anyway from quicksilver poisoning
sleep tight everypony
No...
bye, Sonny
got school in 7 hours xp
night, Sonny. :)
TROctavia: Indeed, and it'll blend the materia between the two universes, causing only gamma ray able to pass out.
As said, a blender
ciao
Vordox: Quite possibly.
Yea but to me it makes sence and serves them right for stoping their research and tricking people
Shizuka: The last link I gave you, Shizuka ? =3
so is carl sagan a doctor of astromony
Oh, Windows Me... The last Windows 9x OS.
TROctavia: wait..
arnt ponys cute
↑↑↓↓←→←→b a that's a paddlin
If Shik
TROctavia: Does that mean, if the two universe is true, there's several big bang?
maybe
Vordox: I don't know. I don't think anyone knows.
If Shizuka is taking requests Vordox I request an Assassins creed 3w playthrough from you tube
Vordox: Like he said, the other side is unfathomable
Lunac: It's not a request per say, it's an admission to possible connected to this video. :P
TROctavia: There's also another thought I had.

yesssh, bill nye
i love bill nye

RUBBING?
bill bill bill
I am probably going to try selling a lot of my stuff during the move. old technology I guess lol
well if you insist mister announcer
My teacher of science is named Jhon Nye and my dad asked him if he was related to Bill.
Doctor Whooves is actually Bill Nye as a pony.
Vordox: Sounds right to me
Try rubbing something....
i already have anouncer
Of course, speculation, but what it is that causes such a drop

now that's awesome
What does that have to do with friction?
Bud-dum-tish
DAT FOOT
Hovers causes things to be elevated...
Mihoshika: hammer nail easy
I did not expect the break thing
Therefore, there was no friction. or minimal amounts
I can't use a hammer, they hurt my fingers.
friction is also a very important mechanic to consider in video game
Ew, Marines

iisnt mlp so much fun
Oh :P
i can think of anothe sport>_><_<
Shizuka, Y U Leik science.
I still have that windows 95 disk set
They're really avoiding one very important application of friction, though.
that water looked disgusting
Cool.

Magnetized areas. :P
Or pushing from object, if you want super simply terms
and a couple food service places, but I doubt I left my charger there :P
twi i thought u were smart.....
i know the textbook logic behind magnets, but i dont understand it
HEY NIKO
Vordox: thats obvious, but if you have nothing to push off,then you couldnt move
WANT TO GO-*shot*

LESS GO BOWLING
twilight_sprinkle: Really? Wanna bet? XD
13EYY CUZZIN
Bill Nye wore bow ties before they were cool
heh dragons are the only bowlers in ponyville
twilight_sprinkle: If you have no friction, we use external forces to cause the mass to start moving :P
Aye, let's go bowling!
13EH NIKO ME MON WAN GO PLAY DAHTS MON
Vordox: obviously, but thats a pain
Shizuka: O.o
I had a really long call with a customer today

winter wrap up
this is one big inuendo
That was redundant.
Vordox is definitly a Vulcan
Zippoman924: Common knowledge...try it.
It's a VERY handy ability
evry girl in japan must smell like fish market
Black people and their singing.
Vordox: um no,that sentence made no sense.
twilight_sprinkle: Which?
its creepy cause she is black
>Grace Slip
>Not that bad records
I am probably younger than you and I don't pay attention to the small things like that
Zippoman924: You get used to it in due time
Vordox: the one you said about holes. dont lecture people on common knowledge,you dont know enough about physics to do so.
credits
>_><_<
whats next :)
Yea probably or I could talk to my GF she is one of the smart people I know
twilight_sprinkle: Wasn't it you and me who had the talk about physics, yet we went from a pressure change to the FRICKING UNIVERSE how it's build and functions?
:P
thats what I hate, it is so hard to explain over the phone how to find something, especially if the person is not paying attention
Settle down, guys
WAHHHHH
Yay
lolwut ?
YEEEEESSSS YEEESSSSS
Was not expecting this
yay
<3<3
twilight_sprinkle: And you say I am wrong when it comes to power output?
wooooo
bob esponja lol
rarity?
:O
yey
Hello everyone.
Vordox and twilight_sprinkle is pretty much my favorite debate contestents
SpikeIs7thElement. I love you soley for that name.
i remember once discussing pinkie pie and ending up at quantum physics
Hi Nyra :)
My middle name is Partick
lol
Tell me ONE instance where a smaller hole/Smaller conduct does not generate force?
The award was bigger than the box it was in
TY<3
and it was one and the smae thign
or higher force output
:o
Hello, Nyra. :)
The Biggest Pink Loser. So Patrick's going to enter a reality show to lose his fat
Vordox: your sentence on the power output of a hole in a box made no sense
i believe it was yesterday Dark_Horst
Tell me ONE instance
ANY instance, please.
thelonepony: naw. that was during season 1 B)
ICE CREAM
CrimsonPhoenix: Oh yeah it was We talked about it. :P
Lmao
Dang it, Patricl. :I
shiny ice cream gems
*Patrick
Where did the trophy go?
thats not how you spell Pinkie Pie, patrick
Vordox: instance of what?
Crystal Trophys.
ice cream?
That's my.. pile of pixelated prizes.
Dark_Horst: wow, that's how long you been here?
Kingdom of Crystal Trophies?
that day we deduce dthat pinkie is ponified quantum physics
twilight_sprinkle: of where a smaller hole/Conduct causes Stronger force output
damn :I
for the first time
it the gold trophy shaped Icecream stash!
SPONGE BOOOOB
Pinkie Pie is a miniature Black Hole.
Defeat that instance of theory, please. :P
thelonepony: found the show at episode 5, i think
the 9th dimension?
:)
Yeeaaaah
YA
:)(:
Vordox: its. a hole. in a box. what is it exerting force on
OH
i know where this is going
pinkie is in all dementions at once
twilight_sprinkle: the force of either side?
"Is this the Krusty Krab?" ... "no, its patrick"
Vordox: what?..
lolSquidward.
twilight_sprinkle: a black hole is a fricking hole into another universe/Dimension etc etc
A...small...hole...
NOMNOM
nomnomnom
Hello everypony.
:|
HAI
That's probably the most EXTREME example I can give. :P
Vordox: i thought you were talking about a hole in a box?

The hell's a Galley?
Vordox: i thought you were talking about aerodynamics
twilight_sprinkle: A hole causes the force of the side of where you wish for the power to be used?
hah...
Lol
Everyone together now.....
yes!:[
twilight_sprinkle: No, I'm talking about the unvierse
lolwut ?
hehe, this...

Wut sudden change?
The one we thread through right now. :P
This is Partick!:[
Go on that youtube video and spam it.
IS THIS MY LITTLE PONY???????????????????????
Now let's have this interlude
sparta!!!
Vordox: well, that sentence still makes no sense
Lolol oh you Shizuka
SPARTA CRAB
oh Shizuka, how i love you~ let me count the ways
I called it~
Sparta is a restaurant?
Is this Bronystate?
1 Nothing wrong with you
twilight_sprinkle: A hole... causes...output force....
is this mlp?
2 nothing you cant do
Is this Bronystate>
Calm down SpikeIs7thElement, we don't stream ponies continuiously.
Let's go to Sparta for dinner
13I'M NOT A SPARTA
NO. THIS IS PATRICK!!
3 i want to hug you
twilight_sprinkle: You STILL need the force to be from elsewhere. ._.
"The Sparta"
i know its a joke
FOOOOUR!
Fishpaste is best swear word
Pstt.... Can ponies be streamed?
^YES
LOL
Shizu ponies!
StinkomanFan: Huh I think he was joking with the This is Patrick bit
stupid town
love that line
LLOOLL
Vordox: no the mass of a black hole simply exerts force on anything else with a mass
Stat give em ponies
13instructions were not clear enough, i got my hand caught in a ceiling fan
OH THIS IS BEST SCENE
im inpressed with his jumping sustainment
Yes
twilight_sprinkle: Then how come only the smallest possible force causes the gamma rays to escape from it?
havnt seen this episode in forever
THE LID
teh lid
this reminds me of someone i talked to today

I know where the lid is >_> <_< >_> <_<
StinkomanFan, you wanna fight?
/me gasp
We are slowley getting more people on the stream
twilight_sprinkle: if we go by my theory, the blender, how come the smallest possible conduct of gamma ray escapes from the Black hole?
Why?
INTERNET ARGUEMENT
Dark_Horst Oh yeah i got 2k certs like yesterday or was it 2 days ago?
Vordox: because it barely has a mass
lets make up with an internet authors collaboratin
Dark_Horst Pimped out my reaver :)
I love how those machined metal furniture pieces in background have non-stop waves to their edges. Maybe the manufacture was drunk. :D
sponge clone
Vordox: and gamma rays escape only depending on how far they are
killerpony7733: little longer. there was a rollback, so that gave us 1k. appearantly there was another rollback the next evening, so we got 900 more
twilight_sprinkle: Aaand this proves that the smaller conduct, the more power it has that makes it able to escape, no?
10 Minutes of spongbob 2 hours of science :)
Can we not cloud the chat with arguments, please
well, time to go watch the new adventure time
power is the wrong word...
force?
Dark_Horst Cool but yeah i got about 2k cerrts
Sponge bob to counter the sciene
NEW ADVENTURE TIME YAY
Stream adventure time lol.
I don't care for Adventure Time
:'(
killerpony7733: mainly spend mine on a little of everything. my reaver has eocket pods and slightly upgraded rotary now. helbard on top of my tank plus shields
Yea, I agree RarityIsCool
nasty jazz
Exactly as i do...
StinkomanFan, didnt we work on a collaboration for a grim dark fan fiction based on smooze?
killerpony7733: new rifles for heavy assault and light assault
brb
Vordox: i cant know what youre aying if even you dont
TROLL
:[
xD
I understand exactly what I am saying
:P
Doesn't that hurt *In the background*
I believe so Lyra`Author.
^-^
we should do something like that again
MEEP
next weekend, when im out of the field
Pickle Fish Lambs.
lol
HAX
twilight_sprinkle: Let's do something smarter... If we talk about conduct...
lmao
this reminds me of that episode of Dr Who
Vordox: no thanks
ahah
what;s it called again.....
Vordox: ill do something smarter and get back to work
twilight_sprinkle: You have a 1inch radius of a copper wire, and a 3 inch, which generate the stronger force? =P
the something planet.....I think
i'm going crazy i keep hearing ponies
Best scene coming up in 30 sec.
lol
:D
YOU OK RAINBOWDASH?????????
:P You okay Rainbow Daash:D
Vordox: i told you a billion times last time, if youre talking about force, you need to say force on what
WARNING, DO NOT TRY THAT AT HOME!
:P
twilight_sprinkle: The force is irrelevant
Dark_Horst I wen't for composite armor at level 3 or 4 idunno but jut one level from all the way. Then fire suppression system one level before the last. Then i upgraded my upwards push force the space bar climb thing. Then i added a ton of ammo only need one more level for being fully capped. Then one lvl 1 zoom and also one level away from full mag size. So yeah It's really pimped out. The rotary is powerful
twilight_sprinkle: I'm talking about the conduct.
OK Lyra :)
idea;)
Idea!;)
dat wall
names rose these days~
Vordox: conduct isnt a proper term,i dont know what you mean.
PATRICK IS DEAD
Nooo
becuase im asthetically pleasing, but ultimatley, i leave people who touch me in pain :3
:D
:)
DOING NOTHING??? THATS RAINBOWS AWARD
Mine!;)
;)!eniM
lol :D
twilight_sprinkle: Take, a needle, push it through paper, how much concentrated force is that?
killerpony7733: and so i leanred that the raver can has armor. i think i should try that
So the moral is...failure at life is winning at life
13well nopony is queued
*reaver
no rainbow does something...AWESOMENESS
Thank for straming Shizuka =3
THE END
13let's continue the adventures of citizen strogg
:D
13i mean strogg kane
Shizuka: Pleaaase show the video I linked you lastly? Shizuka <3
Vordox: depends on how hard you push it
13i mean quake 4
The end.
citizen kane?
Shizuka overtime edition
huh?
13moment
thanks for the stream Shizuka
CITIZEN KANE!
twilight_sprinkle: I didn not ask that.
She ain't done yet
twilight_sprinkle: I asked, how MUCH concentrated is that?
Are the guys runnin the stream open to requests right now?
Dark_Horst Yep your really more resistant not entirely hard to take down tbh. But you survive more.
If so MLP
citizen strogg kane 4
Citizen...LAME!
time to go back to the stoned 55 year old man talking about stuff we learn in science class
Agree strongly, Rarity Is Cool
Vordox: thats called pressure. you said force. and pressure is related to forc. so it depends on how hard you push it
....I think something in my brain just popped when I read a news article which suggests that there are actual, serious petitions by US citizens asking the US government to allow their state to secede.
Nyra: Nope sounds like Shizuka's gearing up for some Quake 4
Im not a brony yet... but im intrested... o.o
twilight_sprinkle:
Nyra, request are rarely up
WELCOME TO THE HERD
13derp now i have to reset ffsplit again
Dark_Horst The flak resistance is the best of it. You can get like 20-25 % resistance to it and then add the reduced damage of flak as of late.
ugh... havnt played lord of the rings online in 4 months and i need to do 15k updates ....
twilight_sprinkle: You know what, I would get into discussion with you, like I did with Crimson, and before long I would've ruin your world and made you more questionable to the universe
So how about...give up. :P
In the ToS, it says "Adults may not attempt to meet in person anyone that is under 18 years of age.
dawwwwwww
No moar?
Best Crossover Ever
So, we can just meet them, and succeed? Not attempt?
Shizuka: No chance that you may show the video? =<
<3
Vordox: oh you have got to be kidding. its as if we didnt talk about this last time at all
Nice.
:(D'awww That is so cute!:'(
Anyone mind explaining what exactly goes on here?
twilight_sprinkle: It's more that you do not understand me, even though I am right. =P
Vordox Hah. For some reason i thrive knowing all that. I kinda love knowing how fragile things are :P
Im new o.o
shizuka hase a cute OC
WELCOME TO THE HERD
xxTehEpicz, stick with me kid, i'll help you shine~
Vordox: ok you know? you have to be the most arrogant, conceited person i have ever met in my fucking life
CrimsonPhoenix: I know what you mean with arrogance, but there's a limit. I don't feel like talking about 3 hours of science again. XD
xxTehEpicz: Make sure to read the rules and FAQ. :)
xxTehEpicz Streams of anything really. Whatever a mod really wants to
Hey, after fighting Angels all day. A pony lying in your lap is just sooooo calming.
Fair enough. Ill just.. watch ._.
twilight_sprinkle: You haven't meant alot of people with IQ before, have you?

Vordox: oh ive met plenty, youre not one of them im afraid

http://i.qkme.me/35jsr0.jpg
Quiet piano time
xxTehEpicz Streams can be art. Youtube videos. Games etc

The music almost sounds like the music from KH : BBS :O
Zippoman924 Shizuka is, you can tell from the stream.
WHOA

either the arguments ends bluntly or you two find some compromise
Its not over, Its not done!
Stream looks great today.
We doing Fallout or Something?
Haibane Renmei OST btw
Things are running smoothly.
twilight_sprinkle: trying to find the correct term.
QUACKE4
QUAKE 4!!!!!!!!!!!
Whos streaming atm?
twilight_sprinkle: The terms is the only thing I do not know.
xxTehEpicz Shizuka

Zippoman924 if you were watching the stream, you would notice Asuka (the girl with red hair and skintight suit) and her signature, Shizuka Kamishima, in the top-right.
CLICK UPDATES
isnt there a coop option for quake 4?
Decisions, Decisions
I like how shizu follows the beat
Music.
Sooooo many buttons.
twilight_sprinkle: What's the term used for the starting force - "This piece here" - Applied force?
I don't think it coops
GTA 4 does though
Oh i didn't read that oh well
>_><_< **leans in*
It's okay, more fun with police
More Shizunanigans! Yay! :)
Vordox: theres no starting foce either
shizumobile Where did'cha get to last?
Quake . . . is that like the Unreal Tournament games?
Menu themes need to be shorter
LOAD
frlrtr
6_96_9*leans away*
twilight_sprinkle: Let's say this, you hold a needle, you have your starting force(The one where you generate the force), and the needle, and then we punch that through paper
What do you call the needle in scientific terms?
Strogg
Quake 4 is amazing >_> <_< >_> <_<
a Wedge of sorts
time to get the binding of isaac
I never herd of Quake 4. Whats it about?
I've heard that quake 4 wasn't all that good
shizumob why do you smell a fish thats vometed wasabi hoppuku
Vordox: its still a force. theres no such thing is starting force
Shizuka: Huge visal lag, and no sound.
No sound.
Vordox: if its not touching the paper then there is no force.
Vordox: point force?
twilight_sprinkle: The generator of force is needed to transoform. ><
Oh there it is.
Restarted
Dat stereo
Sound's fixed
Sound issues = refresh.
Vordox and sprinkle, please, STAHP.
Vordox: again that makes no sense
RETURN
when was quake4 released?
Today.
>_>\
Hop hop hop...
<_<
Boing Boing Boing
Lol
Vordox twilight_sprinkle for the sake of not constantly bringing it up here use PM
Jinx Nyra
:|
twilight_sprinkle: Eating stuff, it becomes energy, the energy is shifted to muscle, we cause energy of movement, this moevemnt is applied to the needle as it punches through the paper?
This is what Pinkie would day all day long in Quake
BOING BOING BOING
killerpony7733: well its more just physics talk at this point, but if you dont want to hear it, then fine
60 fps what type of computer is he playing on
Yes
>_>
<_<
twilight_sprinkle I just think people are getting a tad annoyed is all. I'm not but i'm just telling the vibe i'm getting
Why does this look soo much like Doom 3
other than same designer
inb4 you storm they're prisons
Nyra Cause it's the same engine that's used and the same dev
it's an fps
ok killerpony7733
BeeGees

Vordox, it doesn't do that to everyone http://i.imgur.com/zv8Ae.gif
Now I can see it
What language is that?
Logic
Why does this remind me so much of Unreal Tournament, disregarding similar names (Quake 21/Unreal Tournament)
CrimsonPhoenix: And believe it or not, do not fuck physics, or physics fucks you, litterally. :P
...
Vordox, go talk to Pinkie Pie about that
........
Now I can't stop thinking of "Wreck-it Ralph"....

Endocromatic: hypocrite, as in bronies preach "love and tolerance" yet when she doesnt want to watch it you say SHUN HER HURR DURR, goddamn
Oh.. right. Shit.
Well, you broke the rule

yellowsnow: Prepare for permaban
Verspa: if you write fight club you got kicked :D
Everyone to the shelters!
Bronysith, 4chan is getting in your mind

Reality: Won the olympics

cachi01 HAZ TU TAREA >8C

It was funny, cheesy, fanfiction-y, and Twilight somehow whispered even though she was running.
xtremetoxicguy: she already done it
Jageman: Quake 4.
Dark92Enigma: i have my homework on the other tab lol
/me POINTS at papers >:v
Black Stereotype: People who gangbang everyone
oh
Kurra: i already finished it :D
Reality: Obama, bitches.
dat accent
AJIsAwesome: Thanks
Verspa: Conclusion, fatass rednecks won the Olympics
@_@.....
/me is surprised that Kurra knows spanish :O
Endocromatic: Well there's also a documentary about the fandom being made by some of the people who work on it if you're looking in on the fans
Kurra: plus i have till friday to deliver it to the teacher
Japanese Streotype: Smart people
Strauss is a spy
Who says I didn't translate it... :(
wooo
Bobeh the villain got less airtime than that inferior product which shall not be named, which was a dissapointment. Otherwise, I love it. I'm especially impressed by the animation quality. They somehow improved it. My only other complaint is the lack of Derpy.
I perfer to spectate a speices in their natural habitat.
Reality: Men who makes anime porn that invovles octopus up on loli schoolgirl's asses.
Randomnerd: So Im sitting at my computer typing, when I suddenly realise that my keyboard is infact a picture of a keyboard taped to the toe of a warhound titan! How one managed to steal my computer from under me and replace it with such a large warmachine must have been the work of a tactical geniu-... CREEEEEEEEEEED!
she aint even scared!
MFW I haven't listened to anything from RWV yet
Kurra: because if you translated it with google it would say TAREA HACERLA TU
How do you directly message someone?
Endocromatic: and you can go straight to hell
You probably missed on what Reality on japanese, so here you go
Reality: Men who makes anime porn that invovles octopus up on loli schoolgirl's asses.
Endocromatic you mean Private Chat?
hacer tu tarea?
Endocromatic: write first letters of his/her name and then hit tab
google translate is bad xD

Cyber_Cat: indeed :D
DoctoDoctorWho: lol oh, Creed.

cachi01: Thanks
i just chatted nothing

Islamic Stereotype: People who bomb shit

Randomnerd: what is your opinion on necrons?
rainbow dash... has anypony ever told you that YOU KICK ASS?
cachi01: the internet is a thing?
Reality: The most nicest, kindest, people you will ever meet in real life.
flutterchu: yeah. a very powerfull one
Whoever mentoned homework thanks for reminding me I got to go now Bye
powerpony: rd is worst pony :/
Endocromatic if the right nick doesn't come up at first, keep hitting "tab". The sound you hear is called a "ping", which may come in handy when jokes are made about it.
Lets see whats next..
Verspa: minus the people who do actually bomb shit XD
bai Zippoman924
Do they ever steam fallout or skyrim here?
nope
Well, Yeah...
There is no worst pony
cachi01: I HAVE POWER!?!?!?!?!?!
Or best pony
except rd ShadowQuill
Jageman both have been streamed before.
they all rock
But the people who isnt involved into terrorism is the nicest kindest people yo uwill ever meet
except for rd powerpony
how about
ShadowQuill: What is a worst pony?
Jageman: Fallout, yes. Skyrim hasn't been streamed, AFAIK.
cachi01: orly
OH I GOT ONE!
DoctoDoctorWho: I haven't seen the new stuff yet. But I can't stand how they became super-secret pony-princess best friends with the Blood Angels.
cachi01: Better'n you
Canadian_Brony: Thanks... now i go back to spectating the ponies / bronies.
Can I request a game?
im glad i have power
Nigerian Prince: A man who is in a poor place that you feel sorry for him

◕ ¸ ◕
HoodyNinja: Everypony > RD.... trixie > RD
Guys, did you know..
HoodyNinja: Don't I remember you from somewhere? A worst pony is an opinion of who a fan likes the least, as opposed to best pony.
powerpony: nitt played that yesterday :)
Theres an app called My Little Pony Friendship is magic
PIKAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *forms a thunderball*
okay

Verspa: yeah we know. its a 1 year old news
CHU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *THROS IT*
multiple times
Only this time it has mini games and you get to build poniville
cachi01 Rainbow Dash is my favourite pony from the Mane 6 cast and overall fav. And it isn't because of "LoL RD is RD and therefore best pony". I probably wouldn't be watching the show if RD wasn't the way she is.
REALLY D:
/me chat explodes
I just realized there was one today 3:
Randomnerd: All I know is that they're genocidal OP metal zombies, whats this about friends with the Blood Angels?
the mancubus from doom 3 looks like it should be in quake 4
Canadian_Brony: I approve of this message.
ShadowQuill: yep and also apparently everypony can do a sonic boom
Canadian_Brony: Do you only watch it for RD?
~Has no idea what everyones talking about when they say best pony and stuff like that~
ULTIMATE POWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
best pony= all of them
DoctoDoctorWho: Basically, the BA and the Necrons in one Black Library story teamed up. Dunno why, it just sounds stupid.
Best Pony Is Chrysal Ponies
OH THAT SEXY BASTARD

Gettan frozen burrrrrrrriiiiiiitooooooos.
HoodyNinja is right

OH DAYM
DoctoDoctorWho: but it waz a gift :'(
space marines
Rose`Quill: for science!
Well
HoodyNinja I'm watching it because of RD, not /for/ her. And please tell me that wasn't an /if you know what I mean/.
The pink one that throws parties? Applejack?
thats the only explanation as to their disperced locations and proximity to electronic equipment
fail
I have no best pony, I keep changing my mind while i rewatch the show, over and over again.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW6YrdVzyEQ O.O

razzie: yush
With a chip in his head and a flame in his belly, Robocop continues on his quest to kill all of the Metroids.
razzie: it could've been better
razzie: I can't believe they killed him.
I enjoyed this game more than Doom 3
...and his heart... and almost his free will but he was rescued.
This game is creepy. xD
