Vehicles are fucking flying through the air with wanton abandon, but I'll drive sage.
For future reference my logs do go down to seconds
I'm detecting a minor flaw in his "drive safely" attitude.
BE CAREFUL NEXT TIME!
If I configure a logging bot I may have it to set to autojoin between 3:45 PM and 3:59 PM if there's no other way
how old are you?

SIX STARS

So how long before the helicopter gets hit by a car.
Cool, good deal.
it's really dissapointing that you can't play 2player mode anymore... I would so love to join that game
http://www.youtube.com/user/CommanderHurricaaane are videos of my previous attempts, they are not so great because of immense lag, so instead of recording the chat reactions live I figured I'd save clear chat logs instead and replay them later
Title on www.youtube.com: Commander Hurricaaane - YouTube
Swimming cars :D
im bored
So how long till the chopper crashes?
I was thinking of trying a job like that.

Very nice.

What insurance?
Space.

Eli, maybe the hospital has jesus as employee
wheeeeeee
WHOOSH
That was quick :D
Im sure medical insurance companies would go bankrupt in a day.
i dunno too much social interaction there.
He ran his company out of buisness long ago.
That helmet didn't look like it helped.
"Finish Him"?
Invi: youp. that's it. they keep raptor jesus in the basement
"the internet meets my needs of being alone, while also meeting my needs of receiving attention."
Pfft.
We're going all Mortal Kombat on that guy's flank?
Bit of a fail there.
Mihoshika: true lol
REVENGE
same here
Hit a car with your fist.
Favors....
screw physics :O
and it just flies off
Yeah, I think we should stick to bikes.
It can be hard being a leader at a youth group. I was feeling down last week, I shouldn't have gone.
Walked into a car, it flew over the horizon.
don't touch cars ^^
Jackie Chan had been screwed.
like a startled pigeon
...HARD.
It'd be fun if the same thing happened to people.
pidgeon
Yes, do him some favors, like parking his cars.
HULK SMASH PUNY CARS
I can turn energy on or off.
Do him a favour, drive his wife to the ballet.
I can be a bit of a nutcase if thats whats required. :P
and put on a show.
It's easy to change personalities on the Internet.
Meanwhile: Can't they just look outside the window and watch the car ballet instead?
So close.
GilDash: Shhhhhh.
No I mean IRL
The internet actually sucks away all my energy
FUCK!
Meanwhile: Sorry. I've been warned about being sensible.
Nice distance.

Well... that worked. Sorta.
lmao
I go on it when I'm bored, then when I finally pull myself off I feel like I haven't fully transitioned back into being in the real world
This is way more funny than it should be.
CARS. The ultimate police force.
it's kind of weird
Meanwhile: its the music lol
dang. almost had the tripple backflip
Like nothing exists?
BladedWings: Big factor, definitely.
Why does Niko seem to always say the best quotes for these situations?
OH GAWD, EEST THE CHOPPAH

We love chaos way too much... I guess taht's why we all love discord
Drains brain power.

Police go home
Dark_Horst: You evidently missed the pun.

It would be so hard to survive a race.
ScootaChicken: Oi, that's Meanwhile's job. You can't just stroll on and steal his job.
SpadeMagnes[School]: go home police, you're drunk
Think you can find a golf cart, Shizuka ? XD
Meanwhile: oooooooooOOOOOOH!
lmao
Spelling is for people who arnt being attacked by evil cars
random amulance
GilDash: I can do whatever I bloody well please.

/me claps Dark_Horst on the shoulder.
Because I'm a BronyState regular.
go home town. you're drunk
oh yay, another call
Random fire
Although I can hardly call myself anymore, mind you.
Anyway, how have y'all been?
ScootaChicken: Bloody elitists. :p
Good. Good...
ScootaChicken Will you kindly GTFO?
:3
GilDash: We really are.
Anyone know any good fanfics? Boredom.
ded

We need endless health for this XD
Meanwhile: It shows, believe me. :D
"My computer broke."
Cars are learning, they're hitting with increased frequency.
DashWithRainbows: I'm too kawaii desu motherfucker.
So, why is it she can drive a motorcycle when the friciton's -9
GilDash: Pfft. x]
At this rate, Shizu be bankrupt.
'kay-'kay Jailbait.

Cars flying over the bridge
That was so lucky.
shizu's lucky obama got reelected
Missed by like, an inch.
MLG CARS RIGHT THERE
SpadeMagnes[School], this game was set during saner times.
This is why GTA is always better on PC
when they said the future would feature flying cars, this isnt' what i had in mind :\
Do you think this is what biker's see when they think of people who drive cars?
Nice jump.
this is as crazy as next saturday :O
WHOA
Are bikes the only thing not affected by no friction?
does modding hurt your game system?
Dodge
GilDash: Sadly, yes.
DUKES OF HAZARD SHIT RIGHT THERE
Speaking of saturdaaay...
yes, it makes it sad.
YEAH! Serious Air!
Saturday is mah birthday :3
and sometimes passive aggressive.
GZ

And ponies.
VenHur: BEST EPISODE EVER

Heya DoctoDoctorWho :D
Fuck
It was! It was a car!

Dat car...slowly...
BOOM
Man thse people suck at driving
maybe it would just turn off whenever you do something it doesn't like
What's this fire bollocks? More cars!
Shizuka: HEALTH!

It's even funnier because the close scrapes are *that* close, and every scrape is a close one. XD
thisguy: :D
Russianbrony: in sovjet russia, cars drive you
Why are motorcycles the one thing that obeys physics?
Meanwhile http://i46.tinypic.com/4j0wwg.jpg
Everything is obeying physics.
SpadeMagnes[School]: It's not that bikes obey physics, it's that anything with 4 wheels doesn't.
TrixieTheMagnificent: Perfect.
yeah, discord physics
SpadeMagnes[School]: they have their own friction calculation
And just as all the customers go away and stop calling, everyone stops talking here
Migrating cars time
lol
TrixieTheMagnificent: Sombra for president
What would low gravity add to this situation?
he promised Free health care
SpadeMagnes[School] Alot more flying cars
Dat jump.
Oh gosh
SpadeMagnes[School]: shizu simply multiplied friction for cars by -9
Get closelined.
SpadeMagnes[School]: True Discord

Suddenly, sad music.
Shizu <3
Got it. XD
Is it just me or does politics seem like nothing but lies and slander to make you look better than the other guy?

Likely story...
shut up dari :P
swing VS car... well... can't say i expected that
wow
Heya tigher1001 ;3
*:3
Shizu if you got the car spawn command a good way to make it stay in the swing or something like that is spawning it constantly while being a meter or two away
Hi tigher1001
I just saw a comercial I really hate right now
Wow, that's a terrible virus.

I would like to point out that nowhere am I involved or mentioned in that quote

But KL is.
here we go again...
Why the fuck are we getting the jolly man in red to eat HEALTHY! God I hate some people

I guess Shizuka had a phobia of swingsets.
Swings are dangerous.

I love swings.
I don't even remember the context of that quote at all...

Sounds like one of my nightmares.

What would a car/tree hybrid even look like?
Um. Sidewalk closed.
I can't believe how many people are scared of moths.
Anyone remember the Coke commercial of this? :D
What the fuck is a moth going to do to you?
shizu what happens if you turn the gravity off and try to use a helicopter ?
Ooooh.
Whats that car?
I like moths
I want one.
I'm editing the sound script for one of my tanks. It's being picky.
they're fuzzy
and cute
Yeah, like bees are fuzzy
So which is better GTA or SR?
SpadeMagnes[School]: it would be a canary/light pink car
I think SR is better with the ammount of shit you can do in it
What is that car supposed to be modeled after?
Ever pet a sugar bee? :)
Anyone know?
I don't think so?
What does that swingset have against cars?
On tonight's episode of COPS...
Barb|MyLilPseudonym: pandora's box?
Go to a trash can with some sugar bees flying around. Pour some soda on your finger[s] and let them land on it.
SpadeMagnes[School]: his father got hit by a car :(
Do they sting?
I did it in high school a few times.
Nope.
You can pet it.

Didnt she put it in her lap?
Bronies are the nicest people

SpadeMagnes[School]: Spilled I forget why
Wow. I just saw a thong in a huge sign over a bank. I'd like to fire a rocket launcher at that.
Razor: arent we? :)
Right. That is a conspicuous color.
Why is it that hard to not figure coffee might be hot

SpadeMagnes[School]: Where are you from?
LOL VENHUR
cousin sprunkls, Let's go bowling
Wisconsin...
dat lucious accent
As I recall it was because the coffee was extremely hot, as in impossible to drink hot. That's how she managed to sue anyway.
ok
GilDash http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants
What is this,wii sports?
GilDash: oh wow
Where are the miis?
did the coffee leave her with burns or something?
I need a Niko mii
GilDash: just for a little thing?
In the background.
damn that must have hurt
This one stupid lawsuit was the casper people sueing the ghosbusters for their logo
lawl, dat bowling icon..
The judge said along the lines, get the fuck out of the courtroom
Who streaming?
another lawsuit was people suing Doom over murders.
Stella Liebeck who suffered 3rd degree burns in her pelvic region when she spilled hot coffee purchased from fast food restaurant McDonald's
Yeah, the case was basically the coffee was *too* hot, ignoring the fact that the woman was dumb enough for spilling it on herself anyway.
*logo i mean
SpadeMagnes[School]: Best Judge ever /)
YOU DON'T SAAAAY
I wish people didnt bash McDonalds so much
how did this coffee thing start?
Agreed, SpadeMagnes.
In 1900
At least McDonalds uses their money to help kids...
GilDash: "Insert into mouth"
XD
Little bit of Thin Lizzy...
Hows the writing GilDash
Press B to play as yourself.
Vordox: Yeah, if spilling it causes 3rd degree burns I'd try drinking it...
GilDash: I meant "needed to be told how to drink/eat stuff"
woah, that was unlucky
DerpyMuffins: It's feeling really hard for me this year. Just hit 27,500 tonight.
Ronald McDonald used to creep me out as a kid...
^
^^
*fine
Same
Though BurgerKing masscot is creepy too.
....HOLY CRAP
I have a fear of clowns to this day
Vordox: Oh, I don't disagree. You should know that coffee is hot and that it goes into the mouth, not onto the legs. XD

/me Eats muffin.
Well thanks for the answers, I'll just try and manage to run three redundant log bots at three different places just in case
Human shield
Cya and have fun!
GilDash I think that applies too but the larger it is and the more paper pages to connect the harder it is to pull it apart.
8/10 she stuck the landing!
Wouldent the explosion still go out regardless if you jumped on it or not?
DerpyMuffins, Hello, I am Shizukas car. I can use the turbo bost button once per episode. I have used it 3 times today.

killerpony7733: Apparently my physics teacher built a railgun after I left as well. In my classes I always used to go on about railguns... I might pop into school randomly one day.
trolled by ambulance xD
SpadeMagnes[School]: Its the psycotic ones that don goggles and watch from the trench :3
Wasnt Play dough invented for a entirerly different purpouse than what it is for now?
DinkyDoo: Yeah you can show pictures and that's it
J_E_Smith71: Oh, okay.
OH DEAR CELESTIA ITS A ''YOUR SYSTEM DOESN'T SUPPORT THIS VIDEO FILE'' THING D:
Refresh timeee
Someone please play cool guys dont look at explosions
yes
Did the rocket go under the car there?
;.;
Oh lleh yes
Huh, so my TV has a horizontal white line all the way along it and red vertical line down it now.
DinkyDoo: I think that was ad, you should get adblocker
BLOW SHIT UP
BLOW EVERYTHING UP!!!
Yaaaahahahahahahaaa!
AlienWarhead: I'm honestly thinking of getting Adblocker. I dunno if I should get it..
COp treee

SLEEP.

SpadeMagnes[School], those were newspaper stands
Zzzzz..
Where life is worth while.
''I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UPPP''
Because sleeping makes cops go away.
And then a girl comes in and Hot Coffee happens
How the fuck does skeeping get the cops off your ass?
Thats what I would've said.
Please do a mission
SpadeMagnes[School]: Logic.
"And I'll drive my truck up in heaven, cause' I'm a truck drivin' man"
Cool guys dont look at explosions....
I'm honestly kind of scared, I think about what would happens if a girl and boy are in a bed.. (Shivers..)
Thet have cool guy errands they have to walk too!
SpadeMagnes[School], staying out of the police's sight for a while reduces wanted level. It's simply a gameplay mechanic.
Dis music.
Badasses don't look at cool guys.
Why do I even THINK about this?

I hate it when people dont tag their pics as nsfw on depribooru
At the muffin factory, where your fears and your horrors come true. In the muffin factory, where not a single soul gets through.
or at least questionable.
At the cupcake factory, where you fears and your horrors come true. At the cupcake factory, where not a single soul gets through.

Hey everypony

I want to write a fan-fic that is like, excactly like The Rainbow Factory but with a few changes.
it's not the puzzles, it's not the characters
but i'm afraid of death, but someday life has to end DoctoDoctorWho
it's the godang climax at the end
thelonepony: why so serious lonely?
not sure :I
13so you want to write the rainbow factory
13why exactly?
Shizuka: I honestly have no idea.
because DinkyDoo wants Scootaloo to survive
SO MANY DARN ADS!
i want to write a fic of the triumph of gаk over the gyrobowl menace
Yeah, I want Scootaloo to survive too..

DashWithRainbows: pffft i'd do it if i had time. and werent so lazy
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Eh, I enjoyed it. Opinions!
Also, I see you got away with saying 'gak'. I wonder if I can get away with it too.

Kandarihu: its ok, the gyrobowl wont go too far, because it will fall!

Does anyone know any good fanfics?
Hey everypony, kinda busy right now, not really active in the chat, sorry :(
In the paper that coined the term "tachyon", Gerald Feinberg studied Lorentz invariant quantum fields with imaginary mass.[1] Because the group velocity for such a field is superluminal, naively it appears that its excitations propagate faster than light. However, it was quickly understood that the superluminal group velocity does not correspond to the speed of propagation of any localized excitation (like a particle). Instead, t

Sorry for not being active, sorta busy, thought I'd chip in :3

Mihoshika Background Pony
Tachyons have imaginary mass apparently
Tachyon's don't move faster than light
/me Noms on thelonepony.

I never understood why ponies nom on each other
Kurra: Tachyons have imaginary mass and can not go slower that the speed of light.
/me noms on DerpyMuffins :3
Kurra: in theory
DerpyMuffins: Because Ponies look like Marshmalllows
/me Noms on DerpyMuffins :3
DerpyMuffins, because fun.
what Scoot-Scootaloo said :U
I have have a fear of being nom on
i am a terible person :(
/me noms on derpymuffins
taoumi: why?

20% Cooler:D
taoumi: no you're not

:(
if you stream ponies right now this day will get 20% cooler
taoumi: If anything, I am a terrible person :'9
I don't think terrible people think or know they're terrible.
Never ask for ponies SuperTristan03

oh u
AttackWithHugs: except in lyra's mind lol
There are humans in Equestria...
BladedWings, Lyra's mind doesn't count.

Lyra is not a human, no matter how much she wishes....
can he move though time at will or something?
c_C;...
They just hide in pony suits, like changelings.
AttackWithHugs: but...awww
Mihoshika: Makes sense.

08,01i love changelings
I don't

What gender is a changeling?
I don't hate them either
Someone beat the MLP game? GURRRLLL he must get all the ladies~
DerpyMuffins, unisex?
Uhh
hrm
That's my opinion, though. As far as we know, there's one changeling we know is a female and that's Chrysalis.
And that's just one of the conveniences of a changeling in your home, DerpyMuffins! Order yours today!
Jaaymoo~
DerpyMuffins: whatever you want them to be lol
Fluffeh~ <3
AttackWithHugs: maybe they are all female with a few males, just like insects.
Hey everypony, I need a new wallpaper... Anypony wanna help out?
One of the most annoying things ever is to start reading a fanfic, then find out it's not finished, when you're in the middle of it.

Somepony needs to make an approximate exchange rate between whatever Equestria's Currency is and USD.

/me tries to nom on computer
wanna add me on gameloft live?
08,01this is Dollhouse

08,01and it's what Joss Whedon did after Firefly
thelonepony: i sed gnite RainbowPie and u followd:D

donutpop365: i don't think its possible without a medium of equal value on both worlds
scout19_tf2: haha they just read names and follow on :D
@AJJsAwesome move the clock forward on your phone

Scoot-Scootaloo: oh :D

RainbowPie: well whenever u go to sleep just remember scout sed gnite
sorry Scoot-Scootaloo misping :D
scout19_tf2: haha will do
08,01CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES
Jageman: I mean, using the information given when ponies buy things in MLP, try to compare it with USD prices to estimate an exchange rate.
RainbowPie: its like those facebook games like farmvile and its not online but you can vist other peoples ville.s
@AJJsAwesome if you have a job that goes on for 6 hours, you can go to your phone options to change the date and time, and it moves time forward in the game
your sillieh :3c
Ah. Okay, Squallken.
in other worrds, games broken
donutpop365: would not work, everything they buy would be worth different here because we mass produce stuff cheaper than they doo

*snap
dat gaga
Squallken: Also, if you type part of someone's name in and push tab, it should autocomplete it. :)

OH GAWD LADY CAKA
@AJJsAwesome do you have an iPhone
dat rewind
08,01sorry about that, i didn't realise it had gone wonky
Jageman: True... But we could estimate based upon currencies and rates in other countries, or small areas and locally made and sold products in the U.S. yes? We should do this!!!
I have an iPod, Squallken.
Squallken: lololoolooollo
haseo348: in my language, it has a meaning for something :S
the Caka one
:S
donutpop365: for instance, we have easy access to cherries on the cheap, but 1 cherry cost 10 bits once on the show
but funny :D

bucking pinkie elements i have 250+
I've been playing the game for 3 days and I already have 444 of her's. :D

It's easy to beat the game fast, but you'd need PLENTY of money to do so.
^
you could beat the game?
IMPASSERBU
:O sat bitch is a SPY
*dat
typo
:P
You beat the game when all 6 element statues are awoken and you have the mane six in your new town, IIRC.
AJIsAwesome: so pay lotsa rubies?
orly?
donutpop365: you would have the same problem with trying to estimate the value of a cheeseburger on Gallifrey
twilight_sprinkle: Come back when you're a little MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM richer!

▲

Why was fight club in the kick script?
WAT
goddamnit Gunthler ,you are not worthy of being in the gаk cult.
Video quality seems to work pretty well now, thanks SuperBrony64
SpadeMagnes[R] because it was chosen for BMN
spoiler
no more script, nice.

Canadian_Brony: whats going to be funnier when we put Sumica in the side rooms during g-k commercials
Newfags cant triforce
newbs these day >:U
lel Gunthler
._.
get pooped on
;A;
......
like i said Gunthler ,when you are worthy, he will grant you special powers
:D doggy is rubbing soft fur on legs...shes so warm....
The commercials for that which must not be named seem to be 15 second spots that are always aired in twos.
Canadian_Brony: I said putting Sumica in when those commercials air, kicktacular
Wasnt there like 10 commercials in a row of it>
Nope. 4.
there were 3 if i recall
On the other hand, maybe they are actually 30 second spots that are broken up in two halfs.
its going to be hilarious
4
twilight_sprinkle?
wat.
mY MIstake
Sombra was not the true mastermind behind S3
Either 3 at once or 4 at once.
i saw 4 more today on the hub...
earlier...
SpadeMagnes[R], assuming them to be 15 seconds in length, it was 4 in a row.
my stream lagged during them
I remember when Floam was like that, then that was replaced by Moon Sand, and I stopped watching those channels after that.
SpadeMagnes[R]: What do you mean by that?
Jack Bower this biyatch
more like new years....
Now, all I see are hair products, skin creams, cars and trucks.
i hate those ads :|
Commercials on Discovery are lame -__-
Canadian_Brony, welcome to watershed hours
Canadian_Brony: ikr
The snuggleuppets are fucking ugly
They look perpetually stoned
I don't even..
What game is this?
hey everypony

COD
lol cod
E.T

Alright. I'm taking over the nick
SpadeMagnes[R]: sandel
Someone registered this nick already.
./)_-
I was hoping to register it and never use it again.
gtfo
:3
How do you register a nick name?
Come to think of it, that wouldn't work.
Sorry about this.
If i do that, will that secure it so no one else can use it?
Punkie_Pue, yes.
lol
TACOS...
I think that's how it works
I should probably do that..
color rocks... liquified...
Kandarihu: Thanks
There's a Daffy Duck allusion in here somewhere...
Testing.
A+
Whoops, nvm. :d
:3
Thought my client didn't load the messages again. :P
an wow, i didnt register the name till now :D
im sillieh :3
11,02I'm bored :3
ohhhhh
cooll
SB, try and troll then. ;)
ahh ;3;
so am i super brony..
Knew it
what?
:3
I knew you couldn't last in the game
can we watch some HORSES?
Whoa! Its been a while since ive been on xbox
SuperBrony64: You have L4D2?
haseo348: magical horses :3
11,02L4D2 is boring :(
haseo348: You can go to youtube. :3
^
^^
Yeah blops!
CrystalPhoenix that wasn't even the same game and you still fucking called it.
SuperBrony64: Suit yourself.
youtube is what normal bronys go to...
I find that amusing
/me hugs Everlasting_Joy 'Moo :3'
Hitman?
looks like Black Ops
nevermind
/me hugs SuperBrony64 "woof" :).
play zork
Hey SuperBrony64! Play some zombies O__O
dammit
oh oh lets make up a story ill start!: mudkipz are everywhere and rainbow dash apears...
err Zombies.
They are still asking people to preorder lol
zambie tiem :3
Canadian_Brony: question
so zombies in story?
shoot
Zombies on black ops2 is fun
lol
Is Borderlands 2 worth it?
black ops
djidjlo
dududu
thelonepony FUCK YES.
lol fat man
Canadian_Brony: okay, getting it for Xbox 360 :3
thelonepony if you like the first game, you will fall in love with BL2
Ohey i think ive seen this before
oohh
killed
Canadian_Brony: dont forget claptrap :3
and get a Season's Pass while you're at it. Gaige is OP as fuck.
sup rommie
roomie
thelonepony, if you wish for another opinion
yup, ive seen this
wtf...the tv just rick roll'd me...
CrystalPhoenix: okay, give me your opinion :3
and suddenly COD
you gotta watch on twitch.tv O.o
wat.
I'm reminded of my law I made for this game.
"There is always someone behind you."
thelonepony, Borderlands 2 is alright, filled with reference as if the game is a reference itself but hey if you're in that kind of thing, kinda easy depending on how you level and all but still some good fun
though
carr
better play on computer with friends
highlighting on friends
but my computer sucks ;3;
I'm just saying
and cus no steam :3
Mayhem awaits. Bring friends.
Never play BL2 without friend(s).
cause FPS are generally better on computer and I don't think Borderlands 2 has ironsight.....does it?
I think the computer is the way to go. Much better graphics and the community isn't a bunch of trash talking 9 year olds
CrystalPhoenix it does
How else do you snipe?
does anyome else have to connect to twitch.tv instate of bronystate to watch SB? o.o
Canadian_Brony: if you have Gaige them you technically have a friend lol
Punkie_Pue: If anything, it's harder for them to speak.
Punkie_Pue: But yeah, in general, you are correct.
NocturnalBlade, real friends, it
at the end of game people will often say good game and things like that
That they do.
Plus you can still voice chat. People just dont
CrystalPhoenix: i know i know lol
I liek trainz
Right, right, I have the ability to VC when I'm on the PC, but I don't. Mostly because I'm not interested in what they have to say.
but yeah Borderlands 2 is decent but not exceptional
it's a reference filled game after all
/me train goes through the chat room
it live on jokes it does
/me noms on train
/me nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom
and claptrap makes it better :3
/me is hit by the train "ow!".
thelonepony, because comic relief
/me heals Everlasting_Joy :3
ikr
Thanks thelonepony :).
I wish i could get kill streaks. I suck :(
/me noms the chat

11,02I'm off for now, thanks for tuning in :)
Thanks for the stream SuperBrony64 :3
Thanks For the stream SuperBrony64 :)
:(, well, take care SuperBrony64!
13dear comcast, please stop setting the fucking upstream channel to 10MHz when a braindead monkey could make the connection that every single fucking time this connection goes down it's because one of the upstream channels is on 10MHz
thanks for the stream SuperBrony64
00,02isp's eh
hi Phase4
13it's absolutely astonishing that we have an ISP this criminally incompetent and yet the city forbids any other provider from setting up shop
Comcast isnt monkeys though, theyre business men
soooo
/me noms on Phase4
00,02i meen they ware suites sure
11,02Make sure to refresh the embed for the MIPS one again
Phase4: and buissness men charge nterests on bananas
whoa Shizuka calm down
13it's an insult to monkeys
00,02^
xD
sorry Phase
Lol
00,02XD
00,02ikr
00,02timing eh
Monkeys should run Comcast
Hey the internet over here is...okay
13drives me up a wall that every single time the connection starts to fail, i look up the modem and sure enough it's switched to a bad channel on its own
11,02"The C in Comcast stands for 'We Care'"(tm)
lol
00,02Shizuka, can you use other modems on comcast?
... I was about to set myself up for a Discord joke
Or could care less
11,02Phase4: Yesh
00,02or do they do authentication
11,02You have to get it approved by them
13you can use your own modem, but we're too broke to get one
00,02Shizuka, adsl?
13cable
Aeiou
00,02ah
13the only other option is satellite
John Madden
13or dialup
wooo garlic breadddd
13satellite would be twice the cost at a quarter the speed
13and dialup is dialup
xD
00,02plus satellite would have 500ms ping
00,02minumum
sounds reasonable
00,02speed of light and all that
Hollah Hollah
13yeah, but are essentially internet suicide
13we already shell out $75 for this level of horrible service
00,02Shizuka, i've got a bunch of spare motorola surfboard modems, you can get modified firmware for them that can probably lock the upstream channel
So hey, whats goin on?
00,02ponies
^
/me has statllite before
00,02i assume ponies at least, cant see stream here
it was terrible

Gallium melts at approximately 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
So.
SpadeMagnes[R]: That song was so catchy as a kid, I would literally spend about 7 minutes just running to the theme. :D
the fuck is gallium?
00,02SpadeMagnes[R], metal
Gallium, a metal. Atomic number, 31.
00,02http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium
You should be able to hypothetically (not sure if this would work), stab a key into silly putty, cut the mold in half, take the key out, put it back together, hand-melt the gallium(body temperature is 98.1), pour it on in, and have a cloned key in minutes.
:D
00,02doesnt occour in nature, have to process it from ores
Yep.
00,02found with aluminium it seems
Worth it xD
I need to take Chem. 11
00,02used in older transistors
Canadian_Brony: Chem is a lot of fun, just sayin'.
00,02semiconductors to be more precise
00,02they used gallium transistors in the apollo program
Wut. Transistors, Semiconductors... NOT THE SAME THING.
00,02have to keep them cold otherwise they, well, melt
00,02donutpop365, transistors are built from semiconductors
Well yes, but they're not the actual same thing...
Transistors or resistors?
00,02transistors
ok
00,02transistors are a kind of electrically controllable resistor
00,02thats a simplification but you get the point
You can think of it in a more simple manner as an electrically controlled switch.
did only the essentials in circuitry, mostly just calculations
stupid fucking formulas . . .
This let's you build timer circuits which control larger circuits like in the Tesla Coil I'm building :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4VwbejD0yI&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577
They're also useful for inverting a frequency output, so that way high is low and low is hihg.
high*

00,02more fundamentally, it allows amplification. for the longest time it was imposible to amplify things as that requires a non linear component, which we didnt have until diodes/transistors

Phase4: Ah, you hear Cyanogenmod.com was jacked by the owner who originally handed it over to the team as a donation but never actually handed over full DNS controll.
Dat wall
*WOAH
wow
holy shit
That's a HUGE wall.
lolwut is this?
13protip, parked domains are usually full of malware
Ah, okay flutterchu. I didn't know what you meant before. Just making sure.
13mistype at your own risk
00,02donutpop365, nope
00,02i did try to go to the cyanogen wiki today, was broken
Protip: Run linux because permissions that's why, aaand malware dead.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: sorry.....people say i talk too much.....am I saying the right thing's correctly?....or mabye it's the other way around
00,02yeah, linux has a security system
Nah, it's cool.
And a half decent core...
13can still screw up userland pretty well :)
00,02fun fact: its not actually a security system, its actually intended to stop programs from screwing each other up
Nothing to worry about, flutterchu. :)
00,02just happens to be the same thing
13you only have to 'rm -rf ~'
guys
what
Does anyone know an easy way to obtain Generosity gems in the Gameloft game?
00,02vinly
hia guy
All right, I'm heading to bed.
mentlegen
00,02ohai guy
Shizuka: Okay, the website says to run "chmod 777 bronystatething.sh"... As in that sort of userland screwup?
hey
hi vinly
ohai, vinly. :)
00,02ohai strawberrie_smuckerz
NIght, Everlasting_Joy. :)
ello vinly
Or just being lazy and granting install scripts root?
00,02night Everlasting_Joy
hi guys
night Everlasting_Joy
nite Everlasting_Joy
hah
Goodnight Everlasting_Joy
Goodnight Everlasting_Joy.
Ohai vinly
13donutpop365: doesn't really help unless there's another script under a different user that will try to execute it
hia
Shizuka: Oh you just mean screwing up user's files and leaving the system intact?
00,02i like how privilage escalation in linux is actually a part of the filesystem
00,02makes it incredibly easy to control
13see viruses these days are all about turning you into a zombie box for a CNC botnet
But the true question is . . .
13screw that
can it run Chrome?
13when i become an evil superhacker i'm just going to teach the world about backups
Shizuka: what's a backup?
00,02if i ever get a botnet i'll make it uninstall that terrible oem software
00,02and everyone will be happy
backup your files on a set of disks so your information isn't lost if your computer crashes
any wayy
my vinly name
was toooken
but hia guys
have backups of your backups
13always have three backups, one full backup offsite, preferably on the other end of the country, one full backup onsite, and one or more incremental backups covering revisions between the full backup and now
Well at this point you'd need root to gain startup/init/systemd access, so a linux box botnet would be kind of pointless without privelage escalation...
Is it still appropriate to say init, as it has been replaced by systemd (in Arch at least).
hiaa
13debian and friends are still init that i know of
I just hates viruses.
00,02donutpop365, /me <3 systemd
13djpon3y: pick one
Hello djpon3y.
I just. hates 'em.
00,02systemd is a big improvment over the ad-hoc init.d scripts
Phase4: Made the switch recently, I like it. I agree.
Shizuka: Because debian and friends are old xD
ok ima go to bed
night yall
Night djpon3y.
13yeah but they work :3
Night djpon3y :)
Night, djpon3y. :)
Shizuka WTF? I just stick all my music, pics, vids, games and fan-fics on a portable hard drive.

13i'm just too lazy to wipe haruko and try a different server os
Shizuka: Well yeah, many collectors atarti 64s still work.
13her debian is a bit lived-in now :3
00,02if you want a machine that keeps going like a boss, use debian
SuperBrony64: ew dbz
11,02:<
sprunkls, why u hatin'
05the problem with my comp is the software
11,02WREK O3O
/me glomps Wrek
>_>
00,02thats the problem with most hardware
thelonepony: caus dbz suks :I
Phase4: That's just because they follow the wait a long time for the softwares to become tested for a while.
05hia SuperBrony64 <3
00,02software usually cripples things
no argument here
<_<
Ohai Wrek
WB Wrek
/me noms on Sonny :3
05so who's excited for the 18th?
00,02donutpop365, yeah, they're a little too behind though imho
/me thelonepony nomnomnoms him back
Arch is nice, minimalist, elegant, and bleeding edge. Sure you completely Wrek (heh) your box every once and a while, but it's always reversable.
Wrek, is that when you can stream agian? :$
And it's fun :D
I am
05cause on the 18th i will draw on rbonystate all day and NOTHIGN CAN STOMP ME MUHAHAHAH
Wrek, yay! \:3/
Wrek: In that case, me!
Oh crap
05after doign a charity event
the 18th
05but after that!
That's when my exams start ;~;
Wrek: youre drawing all of us on bronystate?
Phase4: Just curious, what do you use?
Wrek's 24-hour straight drawing stream on Bronystate
Wrek fuck YEAH I'm excited! I miss you and your drawing :'(
/me flips table "Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu"
11,02i liek Wrek :3c
00,02donutpop365, arch on this machine, debian on servers
^
I can help out Wrek :D?
11,02can i be as awesome as u wrek? ;3;
i wish i can draw
00,02the pkgbuild system is briliant imho, really easy to create and track packages
jk ofcrouse >_> I couldn't possibly <_>
13mint is good for desktop
05i will stockpile coffee for then
13will give ubuntu a run for its money
whut
pfft, coffee. I'll stick to Coke thank you very much.
13none of the distros are ready to take on windows but win8 might level the field
Make ALL the coffee.
Bye, Sonny. :)
seeys Sonny
argh! D: don't wanna
bye Sonny
Bye Sonny
05Canadian_Brony: probably for the best my coffee would probably melt your toungue away
Bye Sonny
Bye Sonny :)
*insert sad okay meme
ok bye
13aptitude forever!
00,02donutpop365, yeah, its sweet
00,02Shizuka, yaourt ftw!
13wait huh
00,02archlinux tool, allows you to install from the aur
13oh
00,02aur ~= ppa
11,02Shizuka is best akuzihS
Yeah.
13is arch's tool set named by smashing on the keyboard or by drawing scrabble letters?
Well, not really...
Wrek I can barely stand a fresh cup of cooled hot chocolate. It would incinerate my mouth.
05but hi SB how nice a greetign i got from ye :D
00,02Shizuka, 'yet another arch user repository tool'
11,02Wrek: You got a greeting? o3o
A ppa is an alternate repository right? More like a .deb file I would think.
00,02so no, but thats a technicality
05Canadian_Brony:i meant in termps of caffeine strength
oh
xD
05<@SuperBrony64> WREK O3O
05* @SuperBrony64 glomps Wrek
I can handle caffeine
Whoever posted this THANK YOU. I love music like this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t314wo05ElI&feature=channel&list=UL
13ppa is ubuntu's method of adding new package sources
00,02donutpop365, well ppa is a build system as well, aur is just source packages
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: My Brand
AJIsAwesome|Busy: it was meeeeeeee! :3
00,02have to build locally
05also im so sorry if someone is stremaing
Thanks, thelonepony. :)
Which are more modular and nice :3
05but Canadian_Brony: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AmguxHF75Y
/me 00,02hugs Wrek
13from my experience ppa gives you new packages in apt, it's an alternative to having whatever it is committed to the giant debian repos
Lots of color on today
Wow
I love old music tbh :3
Wrek: :D
Wrek xD
13that i'm aware of anyway
00,02yeah, apt is additional sources
00,02derp
00,02ppa
Wrek: :D
00,02i'll admit that debian/ubuntu have a more robust package system
00,02arch is tonns simpler but also automates less
13i rather like debian's glacial release cycle, means i don't have to fiddle with haruko much
Again with the minimalism :D
05Shizuka would appreciate my vid link :3
11,02Wrek: Oh that greeting \:3/
00,02Shizuka, i'd like it more if all the packages wernt always one or two versions behind what i want :(
13isn't that hot?
05Extremly
Dat coffee
reminds me of when I /tried/ to drink liquor for the first time, except with a spittake and a mixture of laughter and screams of pain
whoo it's cold
Bacardi 151 is pretty amazing
my name is eral
Gotta' go for the night.
05yay coffee entertainment
05thanks shizu

Phase4 Shizuka: Is debian still on gnome 2?
13iunno
Wait whoa, they switched to xfce?
13haruko's headless i just ssh in
Ah okay.
13mint on my laptop is cinnamon, forked from gnome3
Quick googling, may not be accurate sorry.
lots of coffee talk http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGtKGX8B9hU
00,02donutpop365, debian.... whatever the current release is called is iirc
00,02testing is on gnome 3
Night, Ven
DOH!
don't put coffee in your backpack
slowpoke.jpg
it'll spill everywhere and make it stink for a week
thelonepony: ;~;
and ruin your papers
sowwy ;3;
Buytoast: My thermos mug broke :( No longer leakproof :(
05Shizuka: i love how judge actually wrote/cowrote multiple episodes <3
13ikr
/me hugs AJIsAwesome|Busy "sowwy"
thermostates are for soup son
not for coffee
/me hugs thelonepony back :)
btw Wrek, you like the music in Fallout, correct?
05some of it yeah
05cattle call sucks
If anyone would like to join I have a terraria server up and running.
ah well, I'm obsessed with this song and I want to play Fallout because of it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9XtBIc8j8
to the Steam store!
Buytoast: Sorry, I meant thermos tumbler, this thing, http://tinyurl.com/agvotla
05best fallout song is blue moon casue it makes me think of luna
the hell is that
that looks like some whack ass metal shampoo container
Wrek: /)
hell the last thermos i used was some ridiculously think and round power rangers thing
00,02"That tin-foil hat really isn't going to help. Take it off, you look silly."
that thing looks like it'd bearely hold the contents of a caprisun
00,02whoever wrote this artical is a cool guy
sorry for linking this, i just love this song
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN4mgg-LW8w
Phase4: :D
Buytoast: Bahahaha, it's really nice, but the lid/sipping thingy design isn't too great, thus the leaking now. You don't unscrew it, you push a button, it's spring loaded and seal based, and thus my beloved tumbler is leaky :(
gak....
lawl
pls go
a spring loaded thermos?
the hell?
are you drinking ice cubes or something?
Dat name...
00,02though he has absolutely no clue how the internet works
/me nom's on G.ak
O_______O
Phase4! you has clothes!
00,02and seems to think that the 'save as draft' option in gmail effectively teleports the information
00,02
oh and ohai Panda-
He's had clothes on for a long time, Panda-. :D
Panda-, now you've ruined it
Hi Panda- :D
OI!
Buytoast: I mean, you push a button which compresses a spring releasing a seal allowing tasty coffee through, press it again and the spring decompresses pushing the seal back in place. Click-click sorta thing.
:3
PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON!

Panda, why did you do that? :<
there a chatted nothing
oi
il do it again
Panda-

because Phase4 looks better in the nude!
sounds like some fancy ass shit for a sippy cup
thelonepony
you put on some clothes you crazy animal :3
what are we talking about?
Buytoast: :P
Stuff. :3
if it's under 10 bucks then maybe it's worth it
me?
clothes?
nah
Panda-: :D
what are we talking about?
dunno
Stuff. :3
we are talking about ponehs
please tell me it was under 10 bucks son
oh okay
please
people seem to have this bizare thought pattern that things like gmail are what terrorists and other less desierables use to communicate
05"Teal'c waht are you doing?" "I dunno..."
and this locking these services down solves the problem
thus;
05Phase4!
instead of, you know
ANYTHING ELSE
Teal'c is the space yu-gi-oh right Wrek?
05put some bloody clothes on!
Wrek
NO :<
13i love that it ends with nonstop tealc giggling
/me tosses Phase4 a change of clothes
Buytoast: Aww hay, capitalism :P Nah, Thermos = Hungry for money.
nekkid people
Panda- complained about my clothes
so now i have none
resisting Applejack quote
DID NOT!
DID TOO
Pondoo~ :<
NO!
/me slaps Phase4 around a bit with a large trout
stop fighting Tech and Animal :I
seams liek tilk has a problem being serios all the time
so you paid more than 10 dollars for a giant metal spring loaded sippy cup?
thelonepony, but we fight over wubs ;A;
true
:3
/me Awway!
/me feeds Panda- wubs :3
NOM!
Buytoast: Vacuum insulated so coffee, tea, etc is hot or cold for 5-9 hours. Oh and you don't stain the carpet :3
Buytoast: But sure xD
goddamn, for 10 bucks i could buy 5 t-shirts
05Shizuka: when he sings

BronyState is the best. Period.
Did you know that there are estimated 1.25 million bronies?
I am one of them.
You know who else is one of them?
MY MOM!
*musclemantrollface.png*
Hey i got a question for everypony in here and be truly onnest with me..........do yall hate me and my name to?
No, but really. She's a brony.
No.
Moopy, no, not at all .-.
Oh..................ok
Of course not, Moopy. :S
Moopy: what makes you think that?
And damn, I really need to try more aircraft gameplay on PS2
It was just a thought though
Being gunner is fun \:3/
We only hate people who interfere with our server, like a certain someone who is stalking the door to my room. He will get an unnexpected surprise when it asks for a password.
Be right back.
I need to sleep. Night everyone, and enjoy Phase4's stream! :)
00,02y so repeat
Goodnight AJIsAwesome|Asleep :P
/me hugs AdamTheDuck goodnight :)
00,02night AJIsAwesome|Asleep
hey yall, why dos my bro haf a password
/me hugs Phase4 goodnight :)
Ok so a if i get derped like once in a while i got an idea here if i get derped i am going to click the close window on my screen here for the chat and just come back in i guess so yeah
Nah, it's me, KrazyNoobs, for real. Just testing to see if my password works.
Of course, it doesn't help. You can enter any random thing and it will let me in. Can you fix that up?
eeyup
simple
00,10need nick enforce
put a lock on your keyboard
I entered penis as my password (my password are huge amounts of digits of pi) and it let me in.
hahhahahahahahaha
00,02what happened to your face
So my bro can still get in.
i suggest a Masterlock
you said penisd
My plan is, I will run off, and we he gets on my keyboard, I will run in and bash the living sh-- outta him.
can probably get one at Ace hardware or Menards or something
sexsex
as
He fell for it, he only was able to type "sexsexsexsexsex" and "ass" partially. I got him. :)
Hey what kind of wall paper for your guys computer?
why don't you just lock your room or something
chaotic battle + soothing music = collness
00,10a fine dusting of lime on your keyboard will ensure he never uses it again
coolness*
My room doesn't have a lock.
Well i have the Halo Reach wall paper for my computer background
I don't know what I'm gonna do, besides bash the crap out of him.
I really need to go now.
what you do is
Be back in 30 seconds, let's see how much he can type in that amount of time.
while he's sleeping, you switch everything in his room around
the next night, you move it all again, but then write a cryptic message on his wall with something
I need to put Halo 4 for my wall paper
something like "It seelps unknowing, blinded by the darkness."
in toothpaste
then just keep doing that for a few weeks
00,10I think you flooded it Phase4
JUST STOPPED HIM FROM ENTERING HOW GOOD EEVEE'S VAGINA SMELT. lol, he was actually going to try and enter something about how much he wanted to engage in the illicit act of intercourse with Pokemon. I stopped that bastard, he's on the floor crying now.
hahahahahaha
dat ban
00,10stoping him from saying it dont meen he should say it
You know what i really love guys
goddamn it's like he was writing on his personal blog or some shit
Dang phase4 you got alot of songs you got there
00,02Moopy, i have more
Dang even more
00,10how long if you played it all Phase4?
00,02Sumica, no idea
wait i just got an idea i am going to make a Halo 4 thing on the paint program and set it as my background lol
00,10last time I loaded my full playlist I had 12 days
00,02aparently bullets hurt
kfc
/me has flashbacks of him playing on those claw machines that grab chocolate and stuff :$

SkunkTari, Be a mod. Then you can have colors
00,02SkunkTari, magnets
dont try to make your letters colored, that is only for mods/admins
im just wondering how
and i have to be a mod for it
Gotta have a client, I think.
you can have colors and not be a mod/admin, but you will kicked or banned
you have to be a mod to not get kicked when using colored text
http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/colors.html i believe that will halp
Pinkie :D
cause if everyone used they could abuse the color
so i guess here you have to be mod/admin
This colour text work on everything right?
pretty sure I had colored text once and I got pretty much instant kicked and then got a talking to.

Rainbows \:3/

The way I see it, the colors allow us to tell the mods apart from the non-mods in chat. Those of us that don't have them all memorised anyway.
it's time for this
And aren't constantly staring at the chat roster
yeah
13 i like tf2
purple is my fav color of the rainbow :P

i hope king sombra returns at the finale
05i dont
05he was too hollow of a villain
with a greater backstory
What would the Final Season of the Season Finale look like?
Wrek, and he'll get development later on
05he was already obliterated at end of ep2
his horn survived
Oh this discussion'll end well.
*popcorn*
05CrystalPhoenix i should ban you for spoilers then
05for tellign em
Arguments, arguments everywhere...
05me*
And ohai Bronysith
Wrek it was a guess
Sombra was the worst villain ever.... I mean ever
05then you word it "i think"
05its not hard
Oh deary me.
05without "i think"
05you risk your plot
he didnt have a good enough history
like chrysalis
All it says he was king of Sombra
I mean Crystal Palace..
Wrek, with due respect, but you're trying to teach discussion skills on the INTERNET?
fail.. rofl
SkunkTari: at least he didnt shove everything down our throat last minute
[]DeadpoolDash, i lol'd
Tell me, do you like futility? :P
05Lasharus: and ive managed quite well
05seeign how clean this chat is
[]DeadpoolDash, i lol'd
Perhaps I'm just a tad too cynical about the net.
But then, I occasionally read MMO-champion's forums. I should stop doing that.
Place is a bloody cesspit...
ill stick to 4chan ty very much
Spam of Pinkie Pie!
i do admit tho that king sombra is very ruthless and cold for making the crystal ponies as slaves
...4chan is THE cesspit of the internet, Bronysith. And you'll never convince me otherwise.
'I think'
Lasharus: never said it wasnt
See, Wrek, it worked!
:P
pinkie everywhere
Duly noted, Bronysith.
Pinkie everywhere again!
Lasharus: still a wonderfully fun place
Possibly I have too much brain, or at least the wrong sort of brain, for it.
spike became a crystal dragon
Spike is gonna eat himself :P
The kind of brain that can't stand memes, and thinks trolling is merely a byproduct of mental derangement. It tends to leave 4chan well within the list of 'don't go there'.
Spike doesn't eat crystals. He eats gems.
And yes, there's a difference
Dammit..
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352977834345.jpg ha HA
I don't like Metal but when I do it's probably J-Metal
00,02DERP
im guessing that the aurora is permanent as long as the crystal heart continues to rotate
On the plus side, most 4chan links have 4chan in the link itself, making them fairly easy to avoid.

lol
Their all 4chan...
I know. Sadly.

Hello Gold_Demona! :)
Hiyo MadSurge =D
Gold_Demona: so you don't like South Park? :D
Nope. Sure don't
lol Bronysith thats my new tf2 spray
Not my type of humor
00,02"My gun, My Sandvich and my other gun"
Gold_Demona: can i post links not from 4chan?
and documentation
Bronysith, It's not so much the 4chan. It's the constant spam of image links for no actual reason...
you mean like the End of Evangelion?
Gold_Demona: but I spam art too, am I bad too?
I see a Minecraft block..
MadSurge, It's one thing to show off art. It's another matter to just constantly spam random pictures.
Gold_Demona: hmm
yes
a rattata
Gold_Demona: anyway, South Park ain't my thing either, I prefer old timey Simpsons :D
aniderp1, LOL awesome. XD

http://i.imgur.com/6XH4p.jpg Gold_Demona sorry but does this sum up evangelion? lol
^ haha, I remember that
anypony here like doctor who?
nope
Never watched Doctor Who...
SkunkTari: me not really, but there's plenty of whovians here
lol, yeah Bronysith. Pretty much XD
SkunkTari, I love me some Who. :>
I've only seen what's on Netflix though.
i liked the 10th doctor
eevee get in the ball >.>
SkunkTari: everyone likes David Tennant :D
I like all three of the new Doctors
SkunkTari: just remember there's no 11th doctor for some :D
I loved David Tenant instantly. The other two had to grow on me, but now I love them just as much. :>
finally caught it
Gold_Demona: I liked the 9th doctor too :)
He was a loveable grouch. :D
Donna is so funny :P
I love Donna. She's one of my favorites
Gold_Demona: also made fun faces :D
me too
donna is the best
And this may be unpopular opinion, but I also love Amy and Rory.
At first with Donna it was like "Oh geez, I hope she leaves and never comes back" and then she came back and I'm like "oh no, what now?" and then she joins the Doctor and it's suddenly "OMG that's hilarious" :D
Rose was lost in another universe permanenty :(
I never really liked Rose anyway. =/
That was some high grade bullshit :| Time travel is easy, dimension shifting? IMPOSSIBLE
Bronysith, o.o Damn
can cause a universe to collapse
Bronysith, can you link the artis?
artist*
Not impossible... just REALLY not recommended.
Thanks Bronysith :3
Don't want the fabric of reality falling apart
Pfft, Pinkie can do that easy peasy, and the Doctor can't? :D
thats where the reality bomb comes in with the stolen planets
MadSurge, The Doctor isn't Pinkie. :P
The Doctor may be a Time Lord, but Pinkie is Pinkie
Gold_Demona: Pinkie is best 4th wall breaker
yush :>
Even the Doctor can't break the 4th wall.
how she does it will always be a mystery
How she does it is never even questioned. She just does
Gold_Demona: btw, http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/c666216138f3e01f827b20a9a6906710.jpg :D
Heh. Trek ponies
I need to get me some breakfast. brb
its 1:53 am here in hawaii
SkunkTari: barely 1 PM here in Italy

does anyone else think baldurs gate is boring?
Giddy up Giddy up Giddy up up
Baldurs gate?
Never played it
Bronysith: baldurs gate was revolutionary in both dungeons and dragons and in rpgs
and?
i liked the game myself
i think planescape torment is better
giddy up up up
liked the interface upgrades in bg2 a lot more so i always got the mod to play bg1 in the bg2 engine
http://derpy.me/ZmotV
this little horsey wakka wakka
i need to get persona 3
/me licks TheRandomkid321
:3
http://derpy.me/aoZl0
tak of g@k is a paddlin!?
talk of the G word is forbidden?
Well judging from that kick
what do you think?
Double kick.
TheRandomkid321, yes it is
sumica updated the kick script yesterday I think
Is ga- I mean. The G word really such a big deal?
HAve you been on here during tha day?
the*
God it's like Voldemort in harry potter.
and before they enforced this kick
It was just non-stop spamming
Fair enough...
TheRandomkid321, what I'm hoping out of this is that it ceases to be a big deal.
but one day the G shall rise... and mate with the splooge creating the ULTIMATE UNSTOPPABLE VILLIAN!
/me hits TheRandomkid321 on the head with a spoon
:|
Ow.
You know what? The G word is, for all intents and purposes, profanity.
Wait you can say cunt but no G () A () K?
TheRandomkid321, it's profanity to us
http://derpy.me/6cyq5
You know what? Never mind. That was my observation, but you make a good point
Like I said, it wasn't the meaning of the word, it's the fact that it spammed everywhere.
Hey ,hey ,hey , stay outa my G....
speaking of that^I thought hotdiggedydemon would release the final .mov clip at the premier
*reads up* ...splooge?
Go back to bread AJIsAwesome :P
I can't.
Okay I guess I got the wrong word it's not splooge its smooze... and btw DO NOT look up Splooge!
No seriously, I haven't slept. I don't feel sleepy at all. :S
You are all googling splooge as I type arn't you?
/me is now tempted to look up splooge >.>
?
What are you talking about, TheRandomkid321?
TheRandomkid321... Are you sure you're 13?...
Nothing... that never happend.
:$
Yes positive. Trust me. But I was aloowerd to roam the internet freely at 7 years of age...
http://derpy.me/u8Rwc
I mean't to say smooze.
Sure... :$
Ever wanted to just bit on your headphone cable?
No, not really
I've done it once or twice as a kid. :D
I want to play fallout new vegas but I've aleady explored almost all of it... BETHESDA! Y U NO MAKE FALLOUT 4! Nah Im JK put some time into your games bethesda.
Why you no try out Fallout 3? :<
where yall think fallout 4 is gonna take place?
Fallout... New Canada? :$
ha
French Flim Flam song was better, but the polish is pretty good too!
I've played so much fallout 3 I swear if I see another molerat...
all the polish songs are pretty good to me
FALLOUT DOWN UNDER!
TheRandomkid321, mods :P
Xbox :(
TheRandomkid321, try out... Uhh what's it called?
Awwwwwww
Damn...
AdamTheDuck: red dead redemption?
I plan on buying that one day
new vegas is a wonderful addition to the fallout franchise
or borrow my friend's copy, but I haven't played my XBox in a while...
/me is a bit rusty on the controllers
How many buks ya wanna put on the xbox 720 not supporting xbox 360 games without some sort of addon!
i hope they actually make sneaking make more sense in the next game they make
lol XD
naturesfury: fallout?
Fallout + making sense
its pretty bad in any of there agmes Bronysith
this will never ahppen.
:$
naturesfury: you were doing it wrong
happen*
if u have 100 sneak u can be 2 ft away from them and they cant see u
sneaking will always be a strange mechanic in all RPGs with a number stat system
its rediculuos
thats the joy of fallout naturesfury
in the original fallouts, get your sneak to 100 and they will most likely wont see you, get it to 200 and its BITCH PLEASE I AM GHOST
also
>wanting realism in a game
GET OUT
then add a stealth boy and you are freaking god
[]DeadpoolDash: you play the original fallouts? : D
for elder scrolls. shoot em in the head go stealth. they like what happen? and sit back down
Fallout 1 and 2
>wanting games to be realisitic
[]DeadpoolDash: i need to play fallout 2, but i enjoy fallout 1 so much
good old turn based combat and hex based maps
realistic is overrated
just like real life
wonderful graphics, but the gameplay and story sucks
lol yup
friggin real life
XD
the charm of the first 2 games was how over the top they were
its amazing how much gore they got out of those sprites
and how enjoyable the game was
besides, interplay probably has the best motto of any video game company ever
"by gamers"
"for gamers"
^
Jesus yes
i need to play some fallout today
^
they need to port the original fallout to IOS sometime
or android
i mean it is just clicking, so it would be easy for touchscreen
not to mention that would be the best app ever then
that would be so time consuming
where is guanzhou?
even Fallout Tactics would work on a phone
i still need to play that one
but i want to kill the master first
so i need to grind
Aim for the eyes
critical from sneaking
and their torsos explode
/me licks Ponies47
is a bobby pin conductive?
Morning
AdamTheDuck: :D
Hi, Ponies47. :)
I think a high enough speech skill can beat him, not sure been a while
[]DeadpoolDash: oh yea
i need to level sneak and speech more
good thing sneak is already like 130 for me
Noone knows if a bobby pin's conductive?
would Classic fallout be considered a dungeon crawling turn based RPG?
depends on the metal
^
That's what I was sort of thinking, some are plastic aren't they?
damn it bobby
fallout takes a while to get into though
FUNFACT: Laxitives are not an effective way to commit suicide.
TheRandomkid321, please... Don't kill yourself...
The original Fallout is what all Western Turn Based RPGs should try to aim for
[]DeadpoolDash: i like Legend of dragoon turn based RPG though
AdamTheDuck I don't want to start this again. I decide wether or not my life goes on.
drama
keep it out of chat please
But the buffer show is full of drama
I'm trying to do so.
TheRandomkid321: by mentioning you are going to kill yourself
yup seems totally legit you are trying to keep drama out
Bronysith I should Have Pmed that to him.
yes yes you shouldve
The story in the original Fallouts is what really made them stand out in the RPG world
Just forget about it.
so much detail
[]DeadpoolDash: i like how your intelligence affects conversation
yes
also huge tip, ever start fallout 1 or 2, be sure to have agility at 10
cause that affects your action points
action points are god in those games
hello
they are your lifeline
until you max out sneak then you can take as many turns as you want
action points arent all that important in the new ones since most of the game is in realtime
yea
WHy did I start this fallout talk?
mostly for VATS
cause fallout is friggin awesome
Fallout>elder scrolls series
Eh. It's okay. I'd prefere the elder scrolls.
and VATS is only really used for the awesome slowmo show
[]DeadpoolDash: or emergencies
Deathclaw out of nowhere
[]DeadpoolDash: i enjoy aiming at the eyes or groins in the original fallout
I always aimed at legs and arms since they have a better chance to hit and have less HP then the torso
I generally only use VATS when I'm sneaking and don't want to fuck up a shot
or when I need to do some HSLD shit up close
Theres combat outside of VATs!/
[]DeadpoolDash: yea, but deathclaws weakness is the eyes
true
i also love when you get a critical with the machine gun
GUTS EVERYWHERE
the one thing I hate about the new fallout games
just like in real life
is when your save file is sufficiently long
bloody mess was a great perk in the first games
the game starts freezing and shit on you
[]DeadpoolDash: i didnt get that perk
Hanako: thats bethesda for ya
I hate the overexxagerated gore in Fallout. Let's face it, it's only in there to get the kids attention.
no
Bronysith: I have 60+ hours on my first character in FO3
the gore in the first fallouts was way more graphic then the new ones
And I can't use it :<
Hanako: i have over 300 hours on new vegas
how
[]DeadpoolDash: yup
It hasn't become unplayable for you?
Hanako: nope, it is pure awesomness
what platform
PC
no mods
damn
you could literally hamburger a person's upper torso with a minigun
If you're gonna have gore in a game at least make it look good. An explosion blows of your leg? Okay I'm sure that would be an extremely neat cut.
cause anything with the word Fallout or Elder scrolls in it is meant for the PC
/me can't play on PC due to no money for upgrades
^
also I enjoy the PS3 controls
PC is fun for fallout
but some of my fav games are on the consoles
like dragoon, FFVI and VII, Shadow of the colossus
prince of persia sands of time trilogy
Obligatory image is obligatory http://www.tlr-esports.co.uk//src/uploads/users/avatars/master_race.jpg
I'm off to bed
who wants to help me with this thing?
Goodnight theran-gone
AdamTheDuck: die
join ave the first thing i put is derp
Bronysith, :P
there is no "gaming master race"
now for the second thing?
if you enjoy games then play them
watch this http://derpy.me/0egJ0
But the image just looks so stupid XD
That's why I love it,
what does gyro say whne impressed?
[]DeadpoolDash: i dont like heavy weapons
Plays of the stereotype of PC elitists
especially my Anti material rifle in New vegas
with silencer and explosive rounds
Plays on *
of course
considering if your sneak is very high like me : D
Mainly because the ai don't really responde well to long ranged encounters :/
i think i enjoyed new vegas more than FO3 TBH
i like the desert wasteland
the maps in the original fallouts weren't big enough to make them that OP
[]DeadpoolDash: i love the diablo esque graphics of the original fallout
they need to make an Evangelion RPG based on the original fallout
that would be interesting
http://derpy.me/8wV1Y
Evangelion RPG?
Hmm, how would that work?...
it already does dear adam
they made a PNP style evangelion RPG based on Warhammer 30Ks Dark Heresy
not sure what stats you would have in a EVA rpg
[]DeadpoolDash: it is pretty standard, again, based off of dark heresy
[]DeadpoolDash: they made a whole manual for it
[]DeadpoolDash: i made a character and played a small campaign my friend made, pretty fun

naturesfury, you need a real IRC client. lightIRC is sending a referral link to 4chan, 4chan interprets it as a hotlink
Hi Everypony
Hi, BroPony|MEDIC. :)
whos streaming
I was hoping for something like this http://derpy.me/vzz76
Scoots is. :3
Alchemist oh O.O
/me glomps Scoot-Scootaloo for the stream :)
Alchemist: I'll be in my bunk..
Bunk? For what?
AJIsAwesome: I guess that rarity cosplay looks more like Miss Piggy with white fur, purple hairwith a horn
AJIsAwesome: and a horn*
....Stuff
the stream is dead
why nopony talk much :(
*shrugs*
not even a laugh.....
BroPony|MEDIC: Did you refresh?
AJIsAwesome: Eeyup
BroPony|MEDIC: sometimes this page just gives background noise while I do other stuff.
I gotta go soon, im in school and its about to start
in 15 minutes
Bye, BroPony|MEDIC. :)
not leaving yet
*old man voice* in my time we didnt go on the internet between classes and hung out with friends*/old man voice*
Alchemist: Its not between classes, its a late arrival day, and im with about 5 other ppl
late arrival day? You mean you were late from a class, didint attend and now wait for your next one to begin?
Alchemist: No on late arrival days school doesnt start till 9:00
oh, havent heard about that.
this show
Alchemist: you can either stay home until then, or stay in school until then
nostalgia
/me Memory Rape
we had "early arrival" days, or "0th class" that started at 7
hated those days
/me didnt liek this as a kid, but suddenly does
Also Assassins Creed 3

that's about it
Ben Franklin
mr. badass
Where's Buytoast when you need him? :'(
Philadelphia is a safe place.
we need more human rights, such as marriage and guns
Chat, y u keep crashing? :<
also maybe recognizing trans people
but that mgiht be asking too much
AJIsAwesome: Tom's trolling again.
*might
AJIsAwesome: same for me, tried everything, nothing worked.
Alchemist: ?
So what're we watching?
We need to return to the values that we were founded on.
Individual liberty and a secular state?
AJIsAwesome: flash crashing all the time, even on youtube. tried reinstalling it and trying earlier versions, but it keeps crashing
As things stand now, we're just becoming just like every other country, pursuing failed policies and screwing our future over.
At this point, it's not even the distant future.
Hey look! Ponies!
I do like ponies.
I saw recently a lecture about psychology that dealt with compassion, racism and sex. It said that we are compassionate only towrds those who are close to us (not in the physical sense)
Destroying tea?!
Are you insane?!
And we are hostile towards strangers. It called our "close fellowmen" as part of the ingroup, and strangers as the outgroup
the problem and conflicts I see seem to be stemming that people fail to recognize fellow countymen as their in group
pillow knockout
which makes sense
Being citizens of the same nation does not exactly make you best friends
one can control what is being seen as ingroups by teaching the children at a very early age.
because their moral circle is huge at a certain age
after that, stranger anxiety kicks in
-.(\
bye everypony
it was a goddamn good lecture
Bye, BroPony|MEDIC. :)
bye BroPony|MEDIC !
laters BroPony|MEDIC
Stranger anxiety?
We will return after a word from our sponser
It's important to teach them solid moral values at that age. How to approach people who go astray can come later.
NahmanJahden, EffBeeAhh
Kammerjunk: mom hands baby to a "stranger" kid starts to cry.
Alchemist: Humans are tribal.
Kinixys: exactly
Humana social development is interesting
no idea what the topic is, but I've read that many times
They are traits selected by nature.
opinion on*
Stranger anxiety is what kicks in once the child reaches an age where approaching strangers is no longer--fun isn't it? A child will approach another child, usually, without fear, or even an adult, but at some age that changes
there was an experiment, when they put a kid in a room with a stranger. the kid was at an age when he had no stranger anxiety. the stranger (an adult) held some books in his hand, walked to a cupboard and tried putting the book in it without opening the cupboard and then looked at the baby.
I warned you about IRC bro
05there
05fixed tail
and the baby freaking walked over to the cupboard and opened it for him!
Kammerjunk Your 16? :O
I am.
05Kammerjunk: you live close to the boarder?
Wrek: It looks wicked! Well done! :)
Kammerjunk Interesting i'm 18 :P
Wrek, good job there
05if you're close to hesingör its a posibillity to meet me in the summer
Wrek Yay tail!
Wrek: Kind of. I live around the middle of Sealand (or Sjælland).
Alchemist: Interesting.
wait...
05själland :3
I guess it's around 45 minutes to Helsingor.
Wrek Wait where ya going in the summer?
...Which is more or less what I travel every morning anyway.
05down south to me grandparents
05they live close to landskrona
05we tend to visit denmark over the day
Man, the Wii U is coming out on the same day as Wrek's streaming ban getting lifted.
That sounds nice. Makes me wish I could travel more.
Will you stream WiiU constantly?
Wrek Huh damn that's not too bad a trip with the train takes some 2-3 hours so i could make it too
Rarely leave Sjælland, let alone Denmark.
Wrek I live in the mainland on the west coast
I feel sorry for SuperBrony64. He promised to stream his first experiences with the Wii U.
If you got problems, I feel bad for you son. I got 99 problems, but streamin' ain't one.
/me yawn and rubs eyes "Good morning everypony"
Hi, BladedWings. :)
Hmmm Hi folks
Hi, Tervicz. :)
Did King Sombre take the chat with him in his grave?
hi Tervicz
:D
05there
05uploaded yesterdays sumica image
05stop asking now >:C
Do ho ho.
Morning, everyone
Good morning AttackWithHugs *hug*
Hi, AttackWithHugs. :)
Is it- filthy?
Jmo's not here, fluffeh. ;~;
/me hugs BladedWings, AJIsAwesome
It's questionable, Vivix.
I know, Ayejay. I sads.
Wrek Non censor link?
:P
hey i is here...does that count for anything fluffeh?
/me sees
/me huggles BladedWings
/me hears
What's going on? I accientally the window.
Teen Titans i do believe ^_^
Right-o.
This SHOW ruled the world for me!
05internet has ruined this show for me
back then*
aww tits- still
Wrek: Eeyup.
How?
Wrek: the internet ruined everything for me :(
Wrek: How so? Is it what I think it is?
05AJIsAwesome: probably
NSFW stuff?
Luckily, internet never ruined anything for me-
except a few songs
Lucky you, Vivix. :D
:3
TARA <3
^
^^
high?
Tara Strong has a nice badonkadonk.
Kammerjunk, oh lord that song.
For some reason, Raven was my favorite...
Yup, that song.
SHAAAAAADUUUUUUP
Cyborg was my favorite.
Raven what?
Kammerjunk, dude singing it has a nice voice though. All things aside.
Human nature in a moral vacuum ruins things. The means of the moral vacuum is less important than the presence of it.
The pony?
Gesundhait
Raven, second favorite.
Wait, Wrek. You understand runes?
AttackWithHugs: He does.
i love this intro!
This theme song~ <3
TEEN TITANS!
Moral vacuum only exists if you are completely isolated from other beings
05only partially
<3 this theme ^_^
Almost true
Didn't they play the Japanese intro a few times on TV?
and chat crashed
brb
Ah, alright.
AttackWithHugs: yea
05had a friend help me with the ones on the viking
AttackWithHugs: Yep.
even the kids that grew up with dogs actually had pack-morals from what they grew up with
TEEN TITANS! GO!
I see.
BladedWings, AJIsAwesome, thought so
though, some kids who grew up in closed rooms probably could be described as moral-vacuumed
THey even had a joke version sung by the fake chibi Robin.
Who wants to live FOREVER?
oh i remember this episode now ^_^
Vivix: I think there was a child abuse case like that.
Dark92Enigma: Depends on the plane of existance.
Alchemist, yeah, he or she was--in a room for 6 years I think
Vivix: yes
If you don't have a developed language-center in your brain by the time you're six years old, you may never be able to understand language-
it's crazy
AJIsAwesome: i was quoting Queen....
BOO-YAH!
That girl who grew up with wolves never returned to normal, she still goes back to wolf-behaviour occationally
Yeah, I saw a test of that Vivix.
/me Just kidding, i broke in
so yeah- important to teach kids early, it helps them the rest of their life
It sucks that they won't be able to understand language well.
yeah- it really does
DOCTOOOOOOOOR
MEDIC!
:(
It's not a proper "Welcome to the future" if you don't get to say it before the future gets cool.
BAAAAAAAAAAALD SCOTALOO!
SCOOTALOO*
Man, chat be ded.
Baldaloo and Crippleloo walk into a bar, there's a chicken on the counter
Yep.
/me ALL THESE ponies in this town are CRAAAAAAZY
had to do it
o u
There he is <----
Gee, I wonder who that is.
/me Call me, NIGHTWING!
this show introduced me to NIGHTWING (i couldn't afford to buy comic books back then)
UH-OH.....dramatic tension calls me,
CLOCK IS TICKING....CLOCK! IS! TICKING!
The main problem with this episode is that everything goes to pot in 20 years. 60, even 40, I could see-- but 20? Come ON.
Well, this is a world where people like this guy exist.
I can see it.
That would probably have an effect.
BOO.YAH
How?
Magic.
the moment i realized you're all my FRIENDS!
had to do it too
France.
and then baby
goo-goo-goo-gah-gah
/me insert Dr. Whor regeneration theme
Who*
it fits
DE-JA-VU
Screw you, history!
I WAS A BALD SCOOTALOO!??
Daww <3
/me FORESHADOWING <----
d'awwwwwww
Raven is best wind chime
^
Raven is best character.
BladedWings: no doubt
Raven is best crystal pony.
I've never entirely understood why, of all things, they decided that THE best leader for a team of super-powered humans is ROBIN. I mean, seriously, he's basically the comic relief of the batman-verse, existing only to fail at whatever he does.
(note: exaggeration)
whoa! all of the Teen Titans episodes on YouTube?
wut
Oh my
Lasharus: Hey, Robin might be a comic relief, but at least Nightwing.
I've never actively watched Teen Titans, I'm afraid.
When I saw the leader was Robin, my brain tuned out :P
ITS NOHMAN JADEN
^
lol, silly music
We gotta find the damn killer instead of going out there and finding the killer!
oh my
:O
Oh jeez
Oh my, this show I remember.
Oh shit Franklin!
This seems mildly familiar.
BUt only mildly, so I might be off a tad.
dude, Franklin
I used to watch it in the mornings when I was younger.
I remembe the episode where he had a spelling test and cheated
Not a very big thing in the Netherlands, I think.
Kammerjunk: /)
Kammerjunk /)
Sylandest, AttackWithHugs: (\
yay~
lol, uncle snapper
cuz thats a turtle name
inb4 Scoot-Scootaloo shows Little Bear or Kipper
HUG.
"Hug!" "Yes." And then he just walked out the door.
awwwww yeah
FRANKLIN IS DEAD TO ME
I half expected that.
Its funny how we can make so many insights into a simple kids show
DO YOU EVEN LIFT?
^
o u
Sylandest, it's because when you're a kid you don't think about that kind of stuff.
so true AttackWithHugs
AttackWithHugs: indeed, hehe. Its kinda what makes MLP work for me. I can see more into it than if I was younger
The sister is a little shit >: (
I have used push mowers. They are made of tears and hell.
Franklin
stahp
I use a normal gas-powered push mower. I pretty much have to.
The bear is a gangsta~
...how did he get that much paint on him?
I keep my mower in a toolshed in the back yard, and there is a VERY narrow catwalk between the front yard and the back yard, and it isn't even level.
Did he just throw the can at the fence?
damn it internet! DX
BladedWings: oh god, why did you say that?! XD
im sorry, it slipped
BladedWings: no worries, silly :)
and then Franklin flooded the house
So even if my family can afford a riding mower, it just won't fit.
I used a riding mower at work once- didn't like it
prefered the push mowers, if they were strong enough to pull themselves uphill that is
By Push Mower I mean the kind Franklin was using- no power, nothing but a couple of gears and muscle. Those things are a PAIN.
Oh, those mechanical ones?
Yes.
I--kinda want one, but yeah, they're a horror
Kencolt, yeah. I can imagine those being pretty bad.
The sound of them makes me nostalgic and feel springy
And Dad had a pretty big yard.
oh lordy
lol
Bah
Okay, if it's just a Youtube Poop, meh
lol
yep, its a YTP
people are staring at me in the hallway...I dont care :D
05thats agent dashie, sumica and half of Shizukas hair done in ~5 hours
05phew
Wrek: Gratz! Well done :) Now take a load off
^
05implied wanking?
what, no "JAY-SON"?
Wrek: but of course

not sure
I'm talking about mane6+spike here
i don't think so

and without shipping how would packages/mail get sent overseas, courier pidgeons could not carry that weight :c
I don't believe so either, just curious
MLP_Brovakiin: :D

doctor, please start your job
you need to count chat's pulse

Oh I'm great alexxm. :)
OK I think it's safe to say that chat's only hanging by a thread. We need to recussitate, and fast!
What should we do ?!
hm so how about the premire i thought it was good
So artist, what's your medium of choice?
/me tries to revive chat
And the premirere was pretty good, yeah. :)

hello Panda- and Invi :3
hi Lil_B and Panda- ^_^
Hyea Lil_B and Panda- :)
and hi BladedWings :)
ând MLP_Brovakiin :)

HAIYYO!
o/
Hayo
Lali-ho!
Hey everypony
hello
sup Serenity
Favour for everyone, remind me to never put gel in my hair again, it made it worse, heh
hi Serenity and noted ^_^
hello there Chrysalis and Serenity :)
Hai Chrysalis and Serenity :)
Serenity why did you put gel into your hair ?
oh and hi Chrysalis
Rocket: Because Britain is windy, and ungelled hair flops about
Serenity your in britain?
come to buck!
Yes
Chrysalis: I'm going to!
Awesome!
Serenity i wish i was in britain ._.
:(
I think everyone does >:D
>=D*
/me lives in 'Murica
Serenity i dont :P
Best place on world :s
hey everypony :)
i mean best job prizes
hi Sketch_Toku_Brony
Chrysalis I thought Buck is next year again Oo
hey Sketch_Toku_Brony !
hai Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
Lil_B it is
It is
how've you been Sketch_Toku_Brony
but this one is going to be massive
He just decided to make it a few months early
Chrysalis I hope to be there too :)
And by few, I mean pisstonne
Really?
Will be awesome!
Chrysalis: I really want to go but I live 200+ miles away :(
BUCK will be the greatest convention ever (Unbiased opinion is unbiased)
If it's held at Manchester again like Sat'turn says, then I'm only 60 miles away
im 2 :P
lucky :P
I'm around 45 minutes away from Sheffield
And IiRC, Manchester isn't far from there
I would get a train there, but my dad would go mad if he knew that I went to Manchester on my own :P
MLP_Brovakiin just ask if he wiants to come along xD
What will be going on on buck ?
alexxm eh good i guess :S one of my fillings chipped so i gotta get the spot refilled but since it happens like once a year its not biggie :)
I'll be 16 next year, so not only could I go in without needing anyone to daddykins me in, it also means that I get booted out of home anyway
I'm 335 miles away according to GMaps
MLP_Brovakiin you got many months to convince him otherwise
:/
Lil_B: :D it is a shame no one knows I am a brony :P
Serenity: Same here :P
ah ok Sketch_Toku_Brony what did you think of the pictures i sent last night
MLP_Brovakiin: We know, STOP LAEYING >:u
MLP_Brovakiin and here ._.
MLP_Brovakiin only 6 people in a 100KM Radius know I am a Brony
alexxm they were interesting :) pretty creative
100km? Haha
Serenity: ;~;
Lil_B: Yeah, same :p
(That's around 70-80 miles for people who no use metrics)
wow really, using jm?
km*
Lil_B: How do you know that none of us are within 100km? You live in hawaii or something?
Britain is like one of the only countries that don't use Metrics
Sketch_Toku_Brony but yeah i called kyuuby imajinish because of the deals stuff
I need more Game Boy Colour games
Serenity: 70-80? 62 if my mental maths is correct
alexxm oh i see
I only have 3 :3
... man ... BUCK is dated for August 31- 1 Sept 2013 ... I hope I have time there... thats just a few month after school ends and ether Universaty or a Job starts :S
SafariMonkey: I'm in set 2 maths for a reason
OK Serenity. :P
SafariMonkey I know my Country and I know whats within a 100KM Radius :P
For those who don't know, Set 1 is sperg set, set 2 is retarded sperg set
sperg?
Then set 3 and under, not even gonna start explaining
*Aspergers?
No, hehe
Sorry, family member's a goon, and I'm used to the lingo, Sperg = over the top geek
:O oh god, I gotta have it!
Well I have aspergers-like symptoms, but the exact disorder is unclassified
Serenity: Probably comes from aspergers, as that tends to be associated with geek-like behaviours
thats what they all say SafariMonkey, but i say, you have it or you dont.
Hmm, who knows?
not some wierd ass hybrid
And so, the chat dies
chats not dead
its sleeping
so dead
ok guys i must be off to class a little early today but i'll see yall later ^_^
I LOVE BOMBS!
Bye BladedWings :)
seeya BladedWings
yesterday I was kinda in the mute to do something creative, so I started making a Desktop Pony Version of the GalaCon Maskot, it's done, but It looks more like it's lazy littly country-side brother xD
good evening bronystate :)
Snow: I have a different disorder, but at first they thought I had aspergers, but it's definitely not. I have a strange intellectual imbalance, which has been demosntrated by a 'standard' IQ of 145-155 and a speed IQ of 59
hi and bye DaringDerpy ^_^
evening DaringDerpy
Hey DaringDerpy
aspergers has been erased from the new manual
Hai DaringDerpy :)
has it now?
how are things DaringDerpy
was time
convenient, but....no
hello DaringDerpy
Snow: I am definitely not neurotypical
I'm too drunk for a streamless chat
SafariMonkey: yeah same here,they thought it was aspergers for but later found out it was autism
SafariMonkey: they said to me i had a wierd case of pdd-nos, but so far i am only seeing it when im doing certain things
should I insult anyone...fuck you...don't take it personally...but don't make a fucking drama out of it
Gavan! http://henshinjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/RIMG1529.jpg
...darn thought that would work :D
google schizoid bevahiour patterns
Snow: They gave up trying to classify mine. :P
power rangers were after my mass tv consume time
too old
mine was old school cartoons
Lil_B yesterday i went to my desk, looked at it and thought: hmm i see pencil and pice of paper maybe i will draw something .. that was bad idea
like dexters laberatory
Rocket how did it turn out?
DaringDerpy: actually its Uchuu Keiji *Space Sheriff* Gavan,a late 70's tokusatsu show :$ lol now im sounding like Twi :D
never heard of it ^^
twi is best pony
Lil_B well.. i dont know how to draw poniez yet :s and it looked like pig :C
she knows
> use Chainsaw on Chat
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Aspergers and autism are on a kind of sliding scale anyway, though there is some distinction according to some
guess I better go to sleep
> "The Chainsaw has no Petrol in it"
/me puts Lil_B in the naughty corner
Goodnight DaringDerpy :)
have a nice night, day whatever your timezone gives you
wwell, Where can I find Petrol in this Mansion?!
SafariMonkey: ah i see

Thanks for asking SafariMonkey, I'm doing good, testing this stuff, stringing things together, yaddayadda

Rocket: It's easy to falsely self-diagnose that kind of thing
Sketch_Toku_Brony ah, my favorite part
ikr
SafariMonkey everyone tells me that im so so shy
well, currently nothing really is going on, timew to play some games!
Nusskuchen: What specifically are you testing, if you don't mind my asking?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: That part of the episode is so much fun.
SafariMonkey: I'm testing the embed of this IRC
the animator is really good :)
^
Given the experience, agreed.
oh wait, one last thing xD
We are preparing for a big event :)
Nusskuchen: Are you affiliated with ponychan or bronystate? Or what? :P
Yes
Which?
what's the event?
today, there was a Radio Event at my school, they played loud music during the Breaks
We are affiliated for this: http://broniesforgood.org/kallisti-a-massively-multiartist-charity-livestream/
My actual nickname is Perrydotto
ah I see
Song Number 1) Gangnam Style (I never saw so many people NOT dance to this song) , and second song was Bangarang
Lil_B: Looks like people are gaining sanity again
I hope lots of people will attend the stream and help with charity :)
Lil_B, it would be awesome if they played discord during this ^^
Serenity my guess is that they didn't knew the song in the first place

Bronysith: you hate yourself?

Bronysith protip: every fandom has it's loud fans
robot is neat

EspyLacopa: that is so true.

Imagine what will fit in your pocket in another twenty years.
alexxm: the crow? seriously?
I just voted for Pom Poko this week
I hope it qualifies as A movie
Bronysith yeah why?
I voted for my standard: Grave of the Fireflies.
EspyLacopa: your car?
alexxm: that movie is fucked up
Jageman: Like in the Jetsons!
alexxm: good but incredibly fucked up
Surely anything by Ghibli is A, right?
EspyLacopa: its totally possible with nanotech
00,10there we go I now have time travled enough to get rarity in my game
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/d7e17366d808429446e706ea3364d0d5.jpg horsies :3

http://derpy.me/XVpu9
No stream? :(
mmnope

geez, planning a competitive team is hard
My phone disapproves of me being a brony. >> Pffft whatever
AttackWithHugs hows it do that?
AttackWithHugs: its an iPhone huh
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/3fc2985b492e6eddb4496d45a62cce1a.jpg Don't let Ninjazz see this :D
it's a phone, what does it know better? :P
Jageman, Android acutally
AttackWithHugs: lolwut, how can it disapprove
hi
alexxm, my phone says that the MLP is incompatible with my version of Android
lali-ho NorthCrusader
D:
Last I thought, the game needed Android 2.3 to run
AttackWithHugs: that's weird, i thought google was open minded about stuff
Jageman, so did I4
And my phone is Android 2.3.4
I thought that was 2.3 and up
i guess not
heh, thats fine, bluestacks doesnt approve either, so dont feel left out :)
AttackWithHugs: can you do a version rollback?
bluestacks is crap
Jageman, I don't think so.
it cant handle any good apps
i have no idea what bluestacks is
[]DeadpoolDash, its the best one i can find atm
I don't feel left out, either. The game just doesn't look very fun.
I'm back. for the third time :P
AttackWithHugs: Sounds like it will be fun to fix
ello

NorthCrusader, where you from?
MadSurge: nice
north philadelphia born and raised
Jageman: hahaha Cupcakes doesn't exist
00,10come on game, give me more magic shards
the playground where i spent most of my days
thelonepony: one you left, the chat got eerily quiet
does that iOS game have any fanon named ponies in it?
it would be funny if someone streamed the pony game
00,10yep
Seems like thelonepony is the life force behind the chat
MadSurge: I wish i could erase my memories selectively
thelonepony doesn't leave this chat from now on.
MadSurge: like deleting a file
00,10I dont know how to stream from my phone
Jageman: Eventually.
can you even stream from phones
Jageman: good thing I learned how to unsee
00,10but yeah the game calls raritys dad "magnum"
magnum PI
Welp, I need to go find some stuff. Be back later guys.
Kinixys: ya, someday. but not today
Sumica any word on if he's a PI
neat
For the love of Celestia, don't kill each other
Moustache dad owns
Oh, and GRAAAAH
I would like to present this to all Bronies.... http://horsepower.emeraldcoastcomics.net/page/13-003-rounded-to-the-nearest-mega-fonzie/
The Dude and Jesus are in there too
MadSurge: teach me how to unsee, oh master of knowledge.
00,10also has "the jesus"
00,10and latroskie
Sumica: and all Lebowski ponies
mitamaking: loving that
Jageman: There's a drug that can be used in conjunction with therapy that will nullify the emotional aspect of a memory.
derpy pops up once a day to give you stuff
Jageman: stick muffins in your eyes
00,10more then once a day
Kinixys: i know that, but its still in the testing phase last i checked
00,10I have found her, scrolled to another part of town and found her again
wow
Oh hey. My computer's gone, I think the graphics card overheated (it was left accidentally for the past 2 days) because the screen goes to a black (monitor recieving black) when I start it and I am able to log into windows however the screen doesn't even show the mobo logo
Kinixys: i have family members with ptsd, so i look into stuff like that
i have never found her twice a day
00,10usealy 4-5 times a day for me
maybe i need more map in sunlight
00,10depending on how often I look
So great.
i need to abuse the ruby glitch before they fix it
00,10she can show up any place on the map
so what is the pony game about
SafariMonkey_: onboard graphics or added on?
00,10takes alot of time twilight_sprinkle
alexxm: farmville/cityville with ponies
you should sprunkls :3
Jageman: Aye. I'd like to modify memories, but hopefully the technology won't create some messed up world like in the anime "Kaiba"
/me noms on sprunkls :3
Sumica: yeah but its the only way i can get wawity .-.
I wish she hung around longer with the other ponies
00,10aye, I just got her
/me feeds pot to thelonepony :3
00,10took me till april to get her
oh u :3
Kinixys: its difficult to target memories because of the native architecture of the human brain.
/me noms on pot :3
Jageman: custom built tower, internal gtx 460
Sumica: does it count a new day at midnight?
Jageman: Yup
mitamaking: I think it was on HULU
mitamaking: I don't know if it's still there.
SafariMonkey_: I don't know enough about mobos to help you, sorry.
the friends thing for me hasn't been working right for me in game
Hulu +
i add friends, but I am forever without any
00,10yeah twilight_sprinkle
mkay thx
00,10also you have to keep going forward in time
00,10it keeps a log of every day played
by the why, the official website has a wallpaper of AJ with a mustache celebrating Movember
Thanks anyway Jageman, I was more telling people here so the knew, but a bit of technical help would be a bonus
[]DeadpoolDash that sounds awesome
so, how about that gak
just making sure it still worked
Sumica: so that means that if i stop manually changing the time i wont get anything until, say, aprile like you did?
The has to be hacked by now so you guys can just get all the stuff.
Sumica: although i guess thats only if i change my time back. mkay, thanks for warning
Ahh, people still getting kicked due to that oozeslime

This is kind of like playing DOOM 3 a little
what are the strog anyhow?
oooo I am so clever
Code Grease
Jageman: the enemy aliens
All that technical mumbo jumbo.
i like the tech guys dialoge
i wonder what the answer to that stuff is
my bwain, it hoots from siency words >.<
twilight_sprinkle, I originally know that voice as Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop, Roger Smith from Big O, and Darcia III from Wolf's Rain. But yes, he also did General Todo from Code Geass.
holy
Woah
/me gives deacon a brain bandaid
TheMonstaMuffin: Oh my...
/me thanks Jageman :)
sonicdude558: Kill it before it lays cyborg eggs!
Kandarihu: k
Hi twilight_sprinkle
Is it in a death star?
Wow. This game has gone from freakish horror show to something that looks like intelligent sci-fi.
hai Nimbaws :)
why is his fps below 100? is it because of the stream?
thanks for the pot twilight_sprinkle >_>
Ohai Nimbaws
<_<
>_>
hi Nimbaws :)
dat typical black guy voice
allo Nimbaws
Jageman: her. And most likely yes
thelonepony: i lied, it was actually meds to cure you from your addiction
Jageman, her, and below 100? 60 is a good number.
twilight_sprinkle: D:
he needs chicken
;3
Hello everyone.
I is dumb, and feels stupids
Hai Nimbaws :3
Dat accent
how've you been Nimbows
id tech 4 is capped at 60 fps, stream is only 30
figures
Then again, for this to work as a cerebral sci-fi storyline, it has to continue after the end of the Strogg war, as your hapless character struggles to adjust to civilian life as a war veteran... a demi-Stroggified vet.
I'ma get some food, nobody go anywhere.
/me goes somewhere
/me wants this game now.

what are we playing
sonicdude558: Quake 4
looks more like doom 3d
so whats this game about
Best gun time
why do all the enemies do that fade away thing
alexxm: no idea
Depends
One, id tech 4 doesn't like ragdolls being around
alexxm: it's about alien cyborgs invading the earth
So theyfade off, doom 3 burned away, quake 4 teleports
thanks MadSurge
But two, the dead are being teleported to the stroyent production area to become food
Hello!
hi Valvad
That was the big fat guy we killed the other day

Hi thelonpony :3
I forgot the E..
DinkyDoo: thelonpony? who dat :P
Thelonepony: I forgot the E xD.
Thelonepony: Hi c:
Thelonepony? who dat :P
Ohai DinkyDoo :)
Hi MadSurge.
why would aliens kidnap humans and change then into solders, that seems inefficent to me.
thats a good question why do the stroog do this stuff
and she touched it xD
thelonepony: Hello. (Did I spell it right now?)
Cuz cyborg.
Jageman: to add more soldiers to their side
alexxm: because they must get new organic parts
ew
thelonepony: why not build robots?
jump scare
DinkyDoo: yes yo did
I'm hungry now for some reason..
Finally xD.
BRB...
Jageman: lack of materials?
and yes metal everywhere
i know that
thelonepony: or grow solders by using the kidnaped humans as nutrients?
Jageman: that... is a actually a good plan c:
thelonepony: or just bomb the planet from orbit.
uh oh
dafuq os that
these strog seem to like to do stuff only because its creepy.
runnnnn
Back.
You know, I've been wondering.. does Rainbow Dash taste like skittles or a spicy rainbow?
maybe both
A Spicy skittle?
is that what the strog want? no to take over, just creep us out?
Or a rainbow that tastes like a skittle?
I...guess
Wait... outside of Equestria, rainbows aren't spicy...
DinkyDoo: rainbow dash takes like a furry mammal
Just take one of each Skittle Color, Eat it, And BAM thats what Rainbow Dash tastes like
/me Eats rainbow cupcake
DinkyDoo: why would she taste like something that has similar colors to?
I have returned.
i HAVE NO IDEA.
so are thise flying things supposed to be woment the strog abducted
Darn caps..
I have no idea c:
<--- That looked sort of disturbing to me..
welome back AttackWithHugs :3
/me hugs MLP_Brovakiin
this looks like doom 3...
these strog like to do things inefficiently
just to be extra creepy
ah Quake 4 ^^
lol
even the sound was pretty equal...
soundes like Imps from Doom 3
Lykhon same company so they probably used the same sounds
oh, okay ^^
didn't know they were the same company, I usually dont play games like this...
doom 3 is a scifi about evil aliens, quake 4 is about evil aliens. they are completely different.
Jageman: probably they can't make good electronic brains :D
:D
No
Same engine
Doom 3 is more bout creatures from hell...
This is raven software
MadSurge: and yet they can cross the void between stars?
Jageman: I refuse to call them aliens. They're demons
^
^^
/me Eats rainbow cupcake
they are demons, that are accually aliens.
Do all the quake games follow the same story arc or do they have their own stories?
/me eats DinkyDoo :3
Punkie_Pue: only Quake 2 and 4
ah
Doom 5

alexxm and fought my little brother
oh
Jageman: I figured it out after a bit: I'd checked the pc-adapter connection and the cable-monitor connection, but the problem was in the connection between the cable and the dvi to vga adapter. :P
Dark92Enigma: your mother called you useless...
Shizuka loves her new toy :D
hi. whats going on here? what game is this?
SafariMonkey: thats always fun, checking every little connection in your system
/me lost faith in humanity, if he had some
Jageman: I feel a bit stupid, reseating the GPU but forgetting something so simple. :P
thelonepony basically she said i did a terrible job, when it's the opposite, and she also said: your grandpa ans your dad did more at your age than you
and*
Dark92Enigma: i know that feel
SafariMonkey: my psu burned out on me last month, i kept hoping it was just overheated
Jageman: Ouch. What wattage? Was it an expensive one?
my mother insults my intellengence but she is always wrong
Dark92Enigma well that makes two of us who had their mums chew them out today
SafariMonkey: it was just a 250w
ohai everypony :$
Hai Michael :)
thelonepony: naw ur dum :>
alexxm i take it, your mom is mad at you
Hi Michael :)
alexxm still*
twilight_sprinkle: ;~;
Jageman: Oh ok. Mine's an 800, so it's a bit more expensive I think
hey Michael
yes i am ;~;
This guy seems pleasent.
yep Dark92Enigma said she had nothing to be proud of me for
/me hugs MLP_Brovakiin thelonepony twilight_sprinkle :3
Ohai Michael

thelonepony: but dont worry, im about to balls up my midterm, so ur not alone :D
:D
What is this?
cod
quake
c:
Ah
SafariMonkey: i was trying to run a radeon 7750? HD on it
Looked like doom
alexxm damn......she really is Milk, alright
Holy Shit...
Dark92Enigma milk?
im so exhausted i have to resort to listening to carameldansen...
Dat dudes got half a head
I didnt know Two face was in Quake
lol
alexxm remember? Milk? Dragon Ball?
chi-chi?
hey
Dark92Enigma i didn't have the channels dragon ball was on sorry
SafariMonkey: I think that is why it burned out
Deacon: point taken, sorry
alexxm she was even on dbz....
:O Shizu's in the Hub's control room?
Jageman: Oh... No surprise there then. :P I got an i7 950 and a GTX460 running happily on mine, but I made sure to get plenty of wattage (it's 2yo now) so I can upgrade without redoing the power
alexxm but it's ok
Dark92Enigma: el otro chi chi ;)
Dark92Enigma i didn't get toonami
Thought it was an alien dog at first
Who's streaming BTW? O.O
SafariMonkey: my mobo was originally in a slimline, so it had a 220w that burned out 3 months after i got it
alexxm no way......
Ponies47 I belive shizu is
Ponies47: shizu :3
ohai Ponies47, Shizuka
nope Dark92Enigma
Ponies47: take a wild guess
Ponies47 Too late, Shizuka
SafariMonkey: i switched it out into a bigger case, and got a 500w? now.
Awww
Jageman: Ah. So you must be an expert on diagnosing and replacing PSUs by now
alexxm i see......you guys had to save money i guess
Dark92Enigma, Your to slow. My question was answered 3 times before you answered it :P
i guess Dark92Enigma
SafariMonkey: lol
Anyone here have a solid state drive?
Jageman: Built them all yourself?
<-- SSD
Is the upgrade worth it?
SafariMonkey: the computer? or the psu?
Punkie_Pue like a flash drive?
Punkie_Pue: Wish I did. :P
it works perfectly for me
Deacon: Simmilar concept, but it replaces the tradition spinning hardrive in your machine.
on the SSD are the 2 OS
Dark92Enigma, Oh. Sorry :<
SafariMonkey: i don't have the equipment to build components yet
Deacon: A flash-type 'hard drive'
oh, those things
Ponies47 it's ok
But Twilight, YOU are the book http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mah7c40sz11rvl3xdo2_1280.png
Sorry, phone
Jageman: I mean assebling the computer. :P
/me Huggles Dark92Enigma :>
*assembling
Id like to get one but my problem with them is wear leveling. To me that seems like a security risk if i ever decide to encrypt it.
SafariMonkey: i am always taking computers apart and reassembling them
SafariMonkey: i get junkers and put all the good stuff into a new comp
mmhmm
Cool, Jageman. It helps when you have a problem, doesn't it. (it sounds like when people disassemble and reassemble guns)
SafariMonkey: i had a minecraft server up, but it was too much hassle to run
CrystalPhoenix: ...did you just post a spoiler?
Dark_Horst, not at all
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma44jjbsce1rvl3xdo2_1280.png
wheres that rfrom then?
That would be advertising and that's against the rules
SafariMonkey: i was going to college for Computer Systems Engineering. I learned a lot.
Jageman: So did I, my friends were always complaining about connection lag though (I had 150kBps then, have 50mbps now)
CrystalPhoenix, Dat Pinkie Pie
SafariMonkey: so i know my way around a computer.
SafariMonkey: hardware and software
epic beard pinkie
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma0i8fyZo01rvl3xdo1_1280.png
SafariMonkey: kinda
/me huggles Ponies47 back
Poor applebloom
CrystalPhoenix: dabuck with scootaloo?
SafariMonkey: there is always more to learn
CrystalPhoenix: lol
Fluttershy is now an Appletree http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9s6tcAD0c1rvl3xdo2_1280.png
:$
http://i.imgur.com/hsXUG.jpg
but yeah I'll stop, there's a stream going on
and that tram looks pretty damn open
Michael, that's cute
i love seeing how many different ways there are to draw ponies
Oh is that quake 4?
CrystalPheonix, at least those are not spoilers.......are they'?
no they're not
Does this look like one? http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9pg1i5muD1rvl3xdo1_1280.png
I missed the coolest part though
aw
I want a Sweetie hat now
I want one O.o
why don't the strong just break the cable the tram is on?
because shush
CrystalPhoenix: dat :S is a hat!
perhaps it's unbreakable
http://i.imgur.com/T331T.jpg this should be awesome
alexxm: physics teaches us that nothing is unbreakable.
Pinkie vs. Bugs would mean the end of equestria
Indeed Michael indeed
alexxm: besides, if it was, why not just go ahead and set up an ambush.
Jageman: Your comment about checking every connection was the same reason I don't do the disassemble-reassembe stuff as much as I'd like to: there's so much to go wrong. :P
Should of made that left turn at Albuquerque
^
SafariMonkey: so much fun
SafariMonkey: lol
less talk, more action :|
these strog are just asking to get defeated.
you'd think that this was their first invasion or something.
Jageman: Well, if something were stronger than any force we could apply to it it would be, even if that force were finite.
Jageman: you'd thing it was almost *gasp* A VIDEOGAME! :O
SafariMonkey: pratically unbreakable and unbreakable are two different things
I love the setup of this facility - no railings anywhere makes a statement - if you have to be told, you dont belong here
lol
oh for the days when all fps' had set health and not slowly regenerating jelly screens
SafariMonkey: one is conditional, and one is impossible
those were good days
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates November 15 (Afternoon)
MadSurge: I know, its like the stream is showing a simulation of some sort. Weird huh.
Jageman: Well I assumed alexxm meant practically unbreakable, as in it that could not be broken.
ok lets assume it was the toughest element the aliens had
SafariMonkey: the strong have access to tech that is able to easily create plasma, anything that could stand up to that would be impractical to build with.
The implication being that it could not be broken by those attempting to break it
yay quake!
night guys
that guy sounds russian
Gnight alexxm
alexxm: night
Nightl alexxm :)
night alexxm
Night alexxm :)
Jageman: Good point. I agree. We're really just arguing on technicalities. :P
Oh night alexxm
SafariMonkey: yes
:)
i love talking tech
or anything science related really
^
Think I will end after this level
brb
TheMaster, there's a place for regenerating health. I'm not disputing that it's overdone, just that I've seen cases of it happening where it really should, like Portal.
Portal wasn't really a first person shooter though
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: TV Guide "Which TV Show has the Best Fans" Poll
With regenerating health it just becomes a shooting gallery situation. all this cover based nonsense
the guy in the radio sounds like atlas from Bioshock
i kill chat ;~:
no dont
killed*
not the chat :'(
noooooooo
Now chat is zombie :(
brb have to help father >.>
Jageman: I just saw that, but I totally agree. I considered maths, physics and computer science at uni before finally settling on maths
SafariMonkey: maths are fun
I dont like Math
Yay, maths.
Valvad: and math does not like you, thats why you never win the lottery.
http://i.imgur.com/kUIOv.png
rain
Im too youge to enter the lottery
Young
lie :D
Valvad: same diff, its all math.
Jageman: I assume you are aware that maths is the british abbreviation of mathematics
Valvad: Everything around you is math.
No really im 17
Too young
SafariMonkey: yes
This Area 41 or something?
Jageman: For a moment there I thought you were poking fun at the plural. :P
Yea but thats the typical Math argument, You know which math we are talking about
Then people say Everything is Match
SafariMonkey: I remember seeing a show called "Look Around You"
Then we are like you know what I meant
SafariMonkey: that is where i got it from
Math not match*
Gnight everypony!
Night Michael :)
Night
Goodnight Michael :)
night Michael
SafariMonkey: have you seen that show?
Jageman: Like once I said something about Australasia and they said 'oh, good old australasia' followed a minute later by 'you get it? because you spelled australia wrong?' :P
Gonna take a nap, cee ya :3
back
SafariMonkey: ?
i almost dropped some stuff xD
Jageman: I was referring to the comment earlier about maths. Never mind. :P
Jageman: I don't think I've seen it
SafariMonkey: I feel stupid for not understanding your comment
SafariMonkey: Look Around You was a british comedy from around 2005? i think
brb
Jageman: Don't worry, it was an anecdote told at a bit of a stretch
whats up guys?
