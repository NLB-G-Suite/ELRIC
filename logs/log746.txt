In the paper that coined the term "tachyon", Gerald Feinberg studied Lorentz invariant quantum fields with imaginary mass.[1] Because the group velocity for such a field is superluminal, naively it appears that its excitations propagate faster than light. However, it was quickly understood that the superluminal group velocity does not correspond to the speed of propagation of any localized excitation (like a particle). Instead, t

Nice
:3
Night.
Damnit >.<
NIght, Pun
Gah!
look for ronbow dosh :D
and twoiloight sprankls :D
thats interesting, it kicked me cause i was already in here =/
11,02darn :/
11,02I'm off for now, thanks for tuning in :)
00,02isp's eh
13it's absolutely astonishing that we have an ISP this criminally incompetent and yet the city forbids any other provider from setting up shop
Comcast isnt monkeys though, theyre business men
soooo
00,02Yahooz, theres a difference?
00,02i meen they ware suites sure
13it's an insult to monkeys
00,02^
xD
Lol
00,02XD
00,02ikr
00,02timing eh
Monkeys should run Comcast
13drives me up a wall that every single time the connection starts to fail, i look up the modem and sure enough it's switched to a bad channel on its own
lol
00,02Shizuka, can you use other modems on comcast?
Or could care less
11,02Phase4: Yesh
00,02or do they do authentication
11,02You have to get it approved by them
00,02Shizuka, adsl?
13cable
00,02ah
13the only other option is satellite
13or dialup
wooo garlic breadddd
13satellite would be twice the cost at a quarter the speed
13and dialup is dialup
xD
00,02plus satellite would have 500ms ping
00,02minumum
00,02speed of light and all that
Hollah Hollah
13we already shell out $75 for this level of horrible service
00,02ponies

/me has statllite before
00,02i assume ponies at least, cant see stream here

Gallium melts at approximately 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
the fuck is gallium?
00,02SpadeMagnes[R], metal
00,02http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium
You should be able to hypothetically (not sure if this would work), stab a key into silly putty, cut the mold in half, take the key out, put it back together, hand-melt the gallium(body temperature is 98.1), pour it on in, and have a cloned key in minutes.
:D
00,02doesnt occour in nature, have to process it from ores
Yep.
00,02found with aluminium it seems
Worth it xD
00,02used in older transistors
00,02semiconductors to be more precise
Wut. Transistors, Semiconductors... NOT THE SAME THING.
00,02have to keep them cold otherwise they, well, melt
00,02donutpop365, transistors are built from semiconductors
Well yes, but they're not the actual same thing...
Transistors or resistors?
00,02transistors
ok
00,02transistors are a kind of electrically controllable resistor
00,02thats a simplification but you get the point
You can think of it in a more simple manner as an electrically controlled switch.
did only the essentials in circuitry, mostly just calculations
stupid fucking formulas . . .

00,02more fundamentally, it allows amplification. for the longest time it was imposible to amplify things as that requires a non linear component, which we didnt have until diodes/transistors

WIAH
Dat wall
*WOAH
wow
That's a HUGE wall.
lolwut is this?
13protip, parked domains are usually full of malware
Nah, it's cool.
13can still screw up userland pretty well :)
00,02fun fact: its not actually a security system, its actually intended to stop programs from screwing each other up
00,02just happens to be the same thing
13you only have to 'rm -rf ~'
guys
00,02vinly
hey
Or just being lazy and granting install scripts root?
hi guys
hah
hia
00,02makes it incredibly easy to control
13screw that
13when i become an evil superhacker i'm just going to teach the world about backups
00,02if i ever get a botnet i'll make it uninstall that terrible oem software
any wayy
was toooken
but hia guys
13always have three backups, one full backup offsite, preferably on the other end of the country, one full backup onsite, and one or more incremental backups covering revisions between the full backup and now
Is it still appropriate to say init, as it has been replaced by systemd (in Arch at least).
hiaa
13debian and friends are still init that i know of
I just hates viruses.
00,02donutpop365, /me <3 systemd
13djpon3y: pick one
I just. hates 'em.
night yall
13yeah but they work :3
11,02http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/521566_439545996106533_1311567319_n.jpg
13her debian is a bit lived-in now :3
00,02if you want a machine that keeps going like a boss, use debian
11,02:<
sprunkls, why u hatin'
05the problem with my comp is the software
>_>
00,02thats the problem with most hardware
00,02software usually cripples things
no argument here
<_<
05so who's excited for the 18th?
00,02donutpop365, yeah, they're a little too behind though imho
And it's fun :D
I am
Oh crap
the 18th
05but after that!
That's when my exams start ;~;
00,02donutpop365, arch on this machine, debian on servers
^
i wish i can draw
00,02the pkgbuild system is briliant imho, really easy to create and track packages
jk ofcrouse >_> I couldn't possibly <_>
13mint is good for desktop
13will give ubuntu a run for its money
whut
pfft, coffee. I'll stick to Coke thank you very much.
Make ALL the coffee.
argh! D: don't wanna
*insert sad okay meme
ok bye
00,02Shizuka, yaourt ftw!
13wait huh
00,02archlinux tool, allows you to install from the aur
13oh
00,02frontend for pacman
00,02aur ~= ppa
Pacman == APT Equivalent.
11,02Shizuka is best akuzihS
Yeah.
13is arch's tool set named by smashing on the keyboard or by drawing scrabble letters?
Well, not really...
00,02Shizuka, 'yet another arch user repository tool'
A ppa is an alternate repository right? More like a .deb file I would think.
05Canadian_Brony:i meant in termps of caffeine strength
oh
xD
I can handle caffeine
00,02donutpop365, well ppa is a build system as well, aur is just source packages
00,02have to build locally
Which are more modular and nice :3
Lots of color on today
Wow
13that i'm aware of anyway
00,02yeah, apt is additional sources
00,02derp
00,02ppa
00,02i'll admit that debian/ubuntu have a more robust package system
00,02arch is tonns simpler but also automates less
Again with the minimalism :D
05Shizuka would appreciate my vid link :3
11,02Wrek: Oh that greeting \:3/
13isn't that hot?
05Extremly
Dat coffee
reminds me of when I /tried/ to drink liquor for the first time, except with a spittake and a mixture of laughter and screams of pain
whoo it's cold
Bacardi 151 is pretty amazing
my name is eral
Gotta' go for the night.
05yay coffee entertainment
13iunno
Wait whoa, they switched to xfce?
13haruko's headless i just ssh in
13mint on my laptop is cinnamon, forked from gnome3
lots of coffee talk http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGtKGX8B9hU
00,02donutpop365, debian.... whatever the current release is called is iirc
00,02testing is on gnome 3
Night, Ven
DOH!
slowpoke.jpg

realistic is overrated
wonderful graphics, but the gameplay and story sucks

the charm of the first 2 games was how over the top they were
its amazing how much gore they got out of those sprites

"for gamers"

mostly for VATS
Fallout>elder scrolls series
Eh. It's okay. I'd prefere the elder scrolls.
and VATS is only really used for the awesome slowmo show
Deathclaw out of nowhere
I generally only use VATS when I'm sneaking and don't want to fuck up a shot
or when I need to do some HSLD shit up close
Theres combat outside of VATs!/
GUTS EVERYWHERE
no
And I can't use it :<

I am sort of vaguely proud of 'murrica

that's about it
Philadelphia is a safe place.
also maybe recognizing trans people
but that mgiht be asking too much
*might
We need to return to the values that we were founded on.
Individual liberty and a secular state?
As things stand now, we're just becoming just like every other country, pursuing failed policies and screwing our future over.
Hey look! Ponies!
I do like ponies.
Destroying tea?!
And we are hostile towards strangers. It called our "close fellowmen" as part of the ingroup, and strangers as the outgroup
the problem and conflicts I see seem to be stemming that people fail to recognize fellow countymen as their in group
pillow knockout
which makes sense
Being citizens of the same nation does not exactly make you best friends
because their moral circle is huge at a certain age

UH-OH.....dramatic tension calls me,
CLOCK IS TICKING....CLOCK! IS! TICKING!
The main problem with this episode is that everything goes to pot in 20 years. 60, even 40, I could see-- but 20? Come ON.
I can see it.
That would probably have an effect.
BOO.YAH

DO YOU EVEN LIFT?

o u
The sister is a little shit >: (
Franklin
stahp
I use a normal gas-powered push mower. I pretty much have to.
...how did he get that much paint on him?
I keep my mower in a toolshed in the back yard, and there is a VERY narrow catwalk between the front yard and the back yard, and it isn't even level.
Did he just throw the can at the fence?
and then Franklin flooded the house
I used a riding mower at work once- didn't like it
prefered the push mowers, if they were strong enough to pull themselves uphill that is
Oh, those mechanical ones?
Yes.
I--kinda want one, but yeah, they're a horror
The sound of them makes me nostalgic and feel springy
oh lordy
lol
Bah

these strog like to do things inefficiently
just to be extra creepy
lol
even the sound was pretty equal...
soundes like Imps from Doom 3
didn't know they were the same company, I usually dont play games like this...
doom 3 is a scifi about evil aliens, quake 4 is about evil aliens. they are completely different.
:D
No
Same engine
This is raven software
^
they are demons, that are accually aliens.
Do all the quake games follow the same story arc or do they have their own stories?
