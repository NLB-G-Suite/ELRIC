Yes. Yes it has.
It's been streaming for quite a while now.
So is there anything I missed?
>Kill someone
ANd it's only halfway? Looong movie.
00,10shame I could not hack the security termnal before the sentrys guned down the robots
Not much, just the usual violence we see on this site
I'm not used to it, but it's quite good
im sticking with this till the end
God, first Ethan got his finget cutted up and NOW he has to KILL someone...
*finger
I'm sensing an escalation here.
Magic Piano Playing Jayden.
If only playing an instrument was that easy
...How you playing the piano with your left hand?
Wasn't there another game that did this? An adventure game?
Need a controller with 88 buttons
Reikim RE?
This reminds me of Atlantica in Kingdom Hearts II :S
Vodka?
Vodka for EVERYBODY!!
No no, it was called...Harvest.
Vodka is mother russia Milk
We ALL know how we loved that so called "level".
Looks like Mr. Rogers
SOOOO whats happened so far..?
Soooo he is batman
And thats alfred
and who the heck is that guy
Alfred
Well Technically
This guy is NORMAN JAYDEN.
fawken idea
You cant kidnap your kid if he's your offspring.
I like this guy.
In a sense, you own him.
ya then its technically called taking him on a vacation
Harvester!
Lol
Makes me think of Harvester.
wat you talkin about butla?
Kidnap kid, send ransom to yourself
why are his sunglasses glowing
Damnit, im out of chicken
His vision is augmented.
Wirisme: Profit
suddenly mars
MARS?!!?
Were you here for the first few chapters, DarkStratos?
Ethan Mars?
Suddently MARS!
Wut?
wait, r u going to sleep irl?
...Okay.
define first few
or sims?
and wtf is THIS
Fuck you I'm Norman.
DarkStratios they are Augmented Reality glasses ARI
Look at your planet, no back to Norman. Hes on Mars.
Underwater enviroment is best enviroment
Is he tripping or exhibiting godlike powers?
SpeedyBolt, only if a court strips you of custody
*now
Norman's office or something?
Yep
Reikim: Virtual reality chamber?
Or is this some kind of virtual world?
so is this based in the future slightly?
its his goggles
apparently theyre high-tech
or hes high
Because this man just rocketed up to #1 on my list of cool characters in this game.
I think this is all his view from his glasses.
and im also guessing the glove
Fucking google glasses
and he might be, since he takes drugs
controller of some sort?
This game promotes cars...um...yay?
HoodyNinja eeyup
HoodyNinja: It's the glasses and the glove
VenHur nope. Thats LBP2
Petrified_Discord: I want one
Not just any glove...it's the Power Glove mk ii!
3D bronystate would be awesome
Which promoted tje PRIUS
The
so wait he has to take a drug to do this or something?
Yea
HoodyNinja: Be careful not to indulge too much...it can be dangerous...VERY dangerous.
night
So anyway, this guy has the coolest office ever.
since the butler dude said dont overindulge in something
^
DAMN YOU DarkStratos !
He cant be the Origami killer, though
Because the killer is white.
i say its the butler
lol ruined your arrow HoodyNinja :P
its always the butler
...Or so Jayden said.
^
How do we know that, Speedy?
OH SNAP BLOOD
hes tripping balls
Here we go again
poison on the glasses?
Killers usually kill within their own racial group unless the killing itself is racially motivated.
so yeah, looks like its not the goggles and its just drugs
so now he is alternate realitying?
"Fact of the day"
So far so good <_<
Meanwhile: ... Dude, how much do you read?
I've done quite a bit of reading about the minds of serial killers actually.
wait what was in the tube, painkiller?
lol, the way he walks
magic salt
That's actually a fascinating topic. Serial killers, I mean.
2,14 a drug, called triptocane
i dont see why killers would care about race if it werent motivated by it.
The alternate reality thing is his glasses, a type of HUD.
wtf does triptocane do?
showering, you're doing it wrong
Him getting the shakes is because he's an addict.
Some people just want to see the world burn
2,14 it's just a made up drug
His nose is bleeding.
and the EYES
dem eys
2,14 and he's going through withdrawal from it
suddenly crime boss
That's some pretty tough withdrawal.
I STARE INTO YOUR SOUL AND FEAST ON YOUR SINS
00,10is that like fuckitdol?
ah ok and what does it cause you to do?
AND YOUR FRIDGE
Eh
It's never actually stated what triptocane DOES
Buytoast: NOT THE FRIDGE!
HE'S STARIN- Okay, this is the FIFTH time I said that, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY!
Caramel buy why does it always hit him after using his glasses ?
2,14 stops your shakes
twilight_sprinkle: Some think it's a safety thing. Killers are often drawn to kill people they understand because if you understand your prey it's easier to do away with.
ok so he is just addicted to a drug
2,14 good question Trixie :P
I say plot
inb4 Meanwhile is a psychologyst
inb4 Meanwhile is a killer
The other possibility is that the glasses are his other addiction, and when not using one, he's using the other.
inb4 Hes a psycho killer! :o
I have no qualifications but I have studied psychology to a degree.
No comment as to whether I've killed anyone.
repairs clock to keeps track of time, tries to ignore time...seems legit
So when not using the glasses he's used to being doped up on triptocame, so when he stops working the urge immediately kicks in.
and then they all got drunk.
ah ok
And theres still 3 more hours of game
and cuts him off
So, we're debating what a video game character is addicted to.
Oh boy. I'll never last. G'night y'all.
haha yeps
...This is fine with me
gnight Kinixys
night Kinixys
Night Kinixys
night
later Kinixys
>quicktime event to clink glasses together
Unnecessary, perhaps?
Thanks for the good times, everypony.
This is almost as good a movie as Other M
Kinixys: Night! :)
They remember every so often that this is a game and not a movie.
"Oh crap add a button!"
I'd call it somewhere inbetween
It's more like a movie where you get to make decisions.
And what's with the girl?
That's the mother of one of the dead kids.
A whore.
Is she real?
TICK, TOCK, TICK, TOCK.
Yes.
...No, I literally think she was a whore.
A whore....literally
And yeah she was a whore.
CLOCK. IS. TICK. ING.
Retired from the business?
I love this movie
So much ticking.
...Why is there a whore there?
Where did she come from?
Who cares?
Imagine working there
with all the ticking
and tocking
constantly
^
its starting to get on my nerves already
^
^^
^^^
Wirisme: Sooner or later the tocking turns into talking... :O
There was ticking?
This is starting to get to my head...
back
Tickticktickticktick
^^^^^^
I like how nobody noticed it until i said something *trollface*
what happened to the old dude
OH SHIT
It's more soothing in my opinion.
holy shit that is one annoying grandfatherclock
3rd thing that has made me jump
But then again, I like to know what the time is :P
HE OVERDOSED
Watch. The killer signed, "The Killer" on the books. So that's how they'll know.
I like to know what time it is 20 times
ded.
Welp.
...Well that's just great.
Manfred NOOOO!!
No, really?
He's dead?
None of my classrooms have clocks
"Oh my god, hes dead"
How was he killed?
wtf happened?
Brilliant deduction.
God...deead...god...
THIS SHOULD BE PARADISE!
It wasn't a gun. No noise.
Shit man, now who will tell time.
^
Father Time?
lol you were there when it happened i wonder why they blame you..
except with a ?
Bitch. We leave.
He was father time
I guess you could say the killer was just *shades* killing time.
Yeah, because that wouldn't be suspicious
isn't he posed to be removing fingerprints
Yes
CriticKitten: Innocent until proven in a court of law
dramatic wiping: engage
That's what hes doing now...I think
the glass hurry
haha, you think people actually go by the whole innocent thing?
back and forth, back and forth
Imagine if the ticking of the clocks got louder during this part :P
No, but you can still use it
IT IS GETTING LOUDER!
Time is ticking, guys. Time is ticking...
Sando furoa
yeah man, polish them clocks all nice and gentle like
Clock is ticking Shelby
i can already tell he will forget to clean the head of the dancing girl so they will get a fingerprint off that
Clock. Is. TICKING!
DarkStratos: ...Nope. They can't get a fingerpringt from that.
DarkStratos: SSSSHHHHH
ah
Oh god i hate pressing triangle.....
Freaking MGS4......
who possibly remembers all the crap they touched in a shop
^

He forgot something..didnt he?
HE'S...ah screw it...
U always forget something
Teen Titans GO!
What was even the point of that?
Dunn[
Dunno
Regardless of waht you do, the game leaves a print on the door...what a waste of time.
haha
....are you serious?
...Is it me, or is that guy or girl new...=
*?
So why bother wiping anything down?
Wait
they know eachother?
Where is the main plot?
2,14 you can wipe down the door

He looks familiar.
So anxious waiting for the next action sequence... :D
DarkStratos: Improv will drive you to crazy things...
Meanwhile: FUC-(nevermind)
HoodyNinja: He was on Whose Line is it Anyway.

DarkStratos: THAT'S a desktop pony (:
I wonder how Shelby ties into this at ending....
DarkStratos: Some off the mods like to use Desktop Ponies. Sometimes it's usually an easy way to tell who's streaming. :D
This is really a good game, because I don't want to leave to even take care of myself.
>Soaking wet
>Take a shower
ah ok
then nothing bad happened at all
Eat? Sleep? Don't want to.
Under the shower?

NoPonyEpic: Even so, best read the rules if you're new. ^^
I'm going to take a wild guess and say Caramel is streaming.
Suddenly, eggs

It was probably Surgeon Guy.
IKR?
YES
A NORMAL MAN
NOT SOME FREAK
1977. When does this game take place?
Yay I love stories
Except for dying and having to restART THE damn level again.
Hoodlums

So this game takes place in 2007? And not a computer to be found?
they just wanted drugs!

Sad story time

John Sheppard has a brother...
Oh I get it....HEAVY......RAIN. FUN! :)
Meanwhile I'm thinking that was their father

So. Hypothesis.
and nothing bad happened, end of flashback
and then car
Canadian_Brony: http://i.imgur.com/75bZq.jpg
Yes lets run around in a CONSTRUCTION ZONE
stupid stereotypical drunk father
the fu?
oh
Origami Killer is the brother, and the kid was killed by the father, thus the testing of Ethan in order to see if a father can really love his son.
Meanwhile LoLz I'm saving that
was like wtf is he doin trying to hide?
STupid sexy drunk father
This is my theory for now.
Reikim: Maaaaaaaaan.
This kid is totally gonna die in the construction zone
O RLY
Ikr
nothing ever good happens in construction zones
Rubarbed?
Well think about it
two kids dumbly go into a constructon zone.
Just came in. This a flashback?
what if it's a construction zone for a hospital?
Yes
Yup.
JusticeKoro: aye
Only blind-folded people or sleepwalkers get out of construction zones in one piece.
reikim yes, but who is the brother?
MOVE YOUR ASS
lol
aight
hi JusticeKoro. Eeyup

Judging by the music, I can tell something bad is going to happen very soon
We can only hope.

WHAT KID WOULD DO THIS FOR THE FUN OF IT
NoPonyEpic I take offense to that. I'm insane.
Idiots.
Tbh, I would.
Fucking idiots.
NoPonyEpic these kids are sane
This kid needs to learn how to act before he taunts his brother for not trying to kill himself
>_>
I used to do this kind of stuff on a farm when I was younger.
KAMEHAMEHAAAAAAAAAAA
Cept they had less building sites and more haybales.
Meanwhile: Several floors up over an open drop?
lol thump of a body
It's Raining.....HEAVYILY. :O
You forgot the "motherfucker" at the end, kid.
so much dramatic music
Reikim: Sometimes.

And then he whacked his gnads on the corner and fell to brain damage.
sounds promising
RUN UP THE WALL!!!! :O

Damnit
Well that's a good sound.
I knew something would happen

inb4 dead
Help...help...help....help....
Should've skipped forward.
should've done it earlier
uh oh (agian)
DarkStratos: Ah yeah, and theres an auto kick if you post more than 9 times in like 6 seconds. Just so you know. :)
You cant leave ANYBODY alone in this game without them getting themselves killed.
Should've counted faster :P
Dead
this was a good idea
that monotonous heelp heeelp heelp
Also, his cries for help are just pathetic.
break his foot!
Klumzeedragon: ya I just discovered that
"Help >.>"
dat VA
Caramel, you let him die?
"Help <.<"
Yep cya
let him die!
It's kind of preordained that he's not going to get help.
I'm imagining someone gonna pull a Mufasa
oh nm...
Well that was your huge spoiler
He becamed Harry Potter, that's all.
So is the cutscene different if you save him (If he can be)?
and we never see him again
"Looks like a storm's coming" "What, ANOTHER one?"
lol a storms coming? ITS BEEN RAINING FOR THE ENTIRE GAME!
>"Looks like a storm's coming"
>currently raining
If you listen to the diolague
>heavily
DarkStratos: Yeah. :P Figured. That's why I'm letting you know. :)
I think they're saying he actually dies.
Because...you know...the boy that lived...that's funny...y'know?
these voice actors are so good!
Oh THAT's why It's called HEAVY RAIN :O Talk about eye candy.
VenHur: sure..
That guy.... isn't gonna try to kill them?
Somehow.
THAT GUY ISNT NATURAL, he didnt try and kill them...
Dun Dun DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
thirty years . . . that would mean this game takes place in 2007
Well then.
wtf is odd about that
But still...remember how this kid was teh exact same one who previously had enough arm strength to haul himself over a large section of I-beam.
JAYDEN
Oh hey Norman.
"He's putting flowers on a grave..."
dat close up
"HE MUST BE STOPPED"
The Origami killer, he an asian that destroys each piece of paper he finds.

Stop! Matrix Time!

2,14 that's a glitch I'd rather not find MASF
when do sunglasses do this?
They wont let us see nude here, MASF123
...uh...I don't even
that F word was ill-placed
Caramel, but she's hot.
I mean . . . this is 2007
I don't think we have a particular NEED to see nude here.
Cmon, focus on the film noir here.
She might be hot, but Caramel is not a pervert.
Ohhh this is a game :D
Atleast I dont THINK he is.
lol
She's made of pixels.
NO SHIT
What's the matter with you.
lol naw it was a cannonball
2,14 no, I'm not an old chinese doctor
HAHA
Pfft
Would a bullet to the brain cause instant death?
>bullet hole between the eyes
Should i buy this game?
>instant death
That guy was obviously a necrophilist.
REALLY?!?
with my 480 screen, it looked like a weird TV show XD
Some people have survived gun shots to the brain.
They HAVE?
Meanwhile: Thought so. I'll chalk it up to magic glasses then.

press R1 to wollow in pity
well...I do
yeah
lol
Rainbow Factory made me want to stab things.
awwww
Better dash on over to Rainbow Lane
I never really read Rainbow Factory
For starters, the majority of pegasus society as portrayed in that fic.
why is it called a butterfly knife in the first place and same
he's so depressed he can't even walk right! :)
After that, probably the author.
Maybe i should give it a read
Reikim: song or fic
Is it bad?
Spectrum_Rush: Fic.
oh look, its raining
/me hugs Reikim. "Noooo stabbing things" :)
Oh shit
there's a street I can walk to called "Rainbow Drive"
is it that bad?
Rainbow Factory makes me want to hug Fluttershy like there's no tomorrow...
Maybe ponies will stop his depression!
Dam cops ruin everything
and a park called "Rainbow Park"
Now we just need a Rainbow Road...
wow, stuff sure went to hell
lol mad dash into house, walks slowly, mad dash to open door, closes and walks slowly again
Rainbow Ride
what is it with cops and doors?
Epic parkour
did you set it to wumbo?
Did he play as the lady yet?
shoot him?
Failcops don't use guns.
Yeah
SHOOT HIM!?!?!
he did?
Very Amazing Parkour Time!
Seriously, I'm pretty sure they'd at least blow out his kneecaps or something.
Caramel accidentally missed a QTE in a fight, and she died.
they probably want him alive
pfft
LOL
who wants people alive nowadays?
fail
Und dann he plummeted to his death.
...Me
:(
fail lol
So is this game like Shenumue that you spend days and days in the game trying to beat it but's Game Over after a certain amount of time (In Shenmue you had until Spring, here you have till the rainfall reaches a certain limit)
are you a cop SpeedyBolt?
Cops don't just shoot people. They try their best to bring them in peacefully.
smart
Nope.
and there's k mart smart!
I ju-
Then again all this QTEs remind me of Shenmue
Busted
Aaaand arrested.
Game over.
DONT MOVE
Ethan gets arrested, doesnt he?
the end
aww
BUSTED
so diffrent.. from when i played....

GAAAME OOOVVVEERRR
god i hate it when they say game over in video games
Dat fourth wall
damn
*dat
Anyway, not really game over.
So that's Madison down, Ethan down.
GAME OVER YEEEEAAAAAH
Let me guess Caramel...you doned that ON purpose?
Ethan's not dead, just imprisoned.
JusticeKoro: *Pinkie flies in*
Back to this hunk.
ow my fourth wall
dramatic scratch
get on with it
did he find the killer yet?
TROPHY

Reloading is for squares.

"I need to reload my infinite ammo."
His aim is insane.

Why is he shooting them?
Press O to kill all the people!
LOL
those guys were just like Agent Smith
i gotta get this game
Not a killer.
T: except way less awesome.

Good job Caramel. :)

:D
Caramel: kill him
Bloodthirsty
he has nice eyes
twilight_sprinkle: Nah. Dude was a prick. We made plenty of good choices.
why is the hallway so red?
Klumzeedragon: still
hes tripping
Now it's as white as Space Oddsey!
i-phone 5
and then there will be cake
I would "drink" the vial
Bottoms up!
if you know what I mean
aaand here we go
too late
Anyone played red faction?
Instantaneous?
no
60 minutes until death
haha no letters for you
yu, yum poison
for all Ethan knows....
MrMalk: Which one?
It's just Everfree
Quick, touch your throat ball thingy!
...
I almost did
Klumzeedragon new one
"here are the last letters... LOL just jking"
MrMalk: Yeah. I've played Armaggedon. :D
Actually
He didnt do one trial correctly.
"U mad Br0??? XDDD"
Here are the last letters "Trolololololol"
Klumzeedragon is it worth 5 bucks?
SpeedyBolt: which one?
lawl
The one where he had to kill that guy
there has to be a way to save the kid without dying. altho its probably too late
JAY-SON: Just Jking? That's a bit redundent. :D
use Google Maps
idiot
you have a smart phone
He knocked him out, in favor of the chat.
use ask.com
But didnt kill him.
ah
Origarmi
Choose carefully...
MrMalk: $5? :O I'd say thats worth it. :) I was fun but not the best thing ever. It's not a sandbox game like Red Faction: Geurilla.
Meanwhile: lol
Ask.... som uch better than Google
much*
yeah
Klumzeedragon I think ill wait until steam winter sale then
even Bing
Bing copied the results from Google
Who wouldn't
until they went encyrpte

TheRandomkid321, you need to control your OCD or it will take over your life. It's a diesease.
Drunkass douche
MASF123 I don't have OCD.
/me hugs SpeedyBolt twilight_sprinkle goodnight. :)

2,14 >Scottie
SURPRISE!
ded
Hey Scottie!

cans.wav?

Meh... I've seen worse
Well guys.

hiya XAX
ello XAX
hi scottie
XAX: Yo what up? :)
Allo XAX.
Welcome back XAX
scottish-geeky: sup
And so the killer is revealed.
hoi XAX
TheRandomkid321, and this is not normal for you? Not correct her words?
scottie: how are ya
Klumzeedragon: It's 5:30 and I just got home from school :|
XAX IS THE KILLER
Klumzeedragon Did I? Anyway usually I do have the urge but for some reason I didn't. I don't go on facebook much so...
yep
Who'd have guessed that all this time, it was him.
XAX is ALWAYS THE KILLER
scootish-geeky: preety good, just destroying evidence and what not
GET HIM
XAX: Eeeeeew. I know that feel though. I used to get home from school some nights at 9. :D
I kinda did.
XAX really? You think you know a guy.... :?
;/
Well, I knew it was him anyway I've seen the game before.
damn quitter
:/
bye everypony b back ina few hours
But still, quite surprising first time round.
Back in previous chapters, he did always change a bit when Lauren bought up the killer.
is that a baby?
TheRandomkid321: Maybe you're accepting that some people are just dumb?
Klumzeedragon: Daaaaamn.
so this guy is the killer?
Aye.
If you havent figured it out.
i zoned out in the middle of the story so i missed a part
Scott Shelby, Is the killer.
i dont even remember his name
Klumzeedragon... perhaps... No, no defenatly not. Or I hope not.
2,14 Scott Shelby
2,14 Formerly known as Scott Shepard
The fatguy is the killer? :O
Yup.
killer fat guy
fat bastard
SHAUN!
SHAAAAUN
why did he kill them though, just insane?
my fav part
Caramel: Should have known. Someone said it earlier too. :I
I assume this is the last chapter, right?

goddamn fat son of a bitch
What do you call a creepy guy who's a brony but clops to bronies? Cuz theres a lot on Omegle...
Yes.
you mean Fattus Maximus was the guy all along?
My father isnt too fond of me. :I
Yes
Buytoast: si
Scott Shelby was the murderer.
SHAUN
Poor guy... Why do I always feel saddened for the villains :'(
Fuck you I'm Norman!
shoot hiim
so
I have a question
Can Shaun die if you take too long here?
I KNEW HEAVY RAIN WAS A GAME NAME!
No idea.
FUN FACT: Did you know that some guy on youtube glitched his game and he could say SHAAUN when ever he wanted to?
But it'd be bloody annoying if he did.
Because villians are people too just have a lust for murder is all they can't help it.
It's like an urge.
lol
MASF123: villains like that should be just executed
...I think people should get 2nd chances,
so
Even if a murderer.
MASF123: if they do it for the thrill, theres no helping them
Punishment yeah, but still...
Thats what i call some.....HEAVY RAIN
a fat guy just snuck up on him on a two-way path..
MASF123: even fredom hating taroist
How could he not hear chubbs magee running on a steel beam?
twilight_sprinkle if they do it by mental illness or a dark past they should have a second chanch
Because Jayden is deaf.
LOL
Either that, or the intense rain and the conveyor belt sounds.
dat box throw
Klumzeedragon: lol'd.
TheRandomkid321: if its an ilness, then its too dangerous to leave them alive, and often pointless
Live you little bastard.
If you die now I'll kill you.
Use the pipe!
YOU GOTTA BREAAAATHE
shaun is ded
Meanwhile: lol
twilight_sprinkle well... sure but by dark past?
gotta push all them buttons
...Meanwhile is right
:'(
TheRandomkid321: hard to say for every possibility
:(
Dat lightning
you must break celery near his ears
Shaun NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
i dont think hell die
:'(
Shaun...
...wont he?
to break the curse
OMG
He lives!
Damn right you live you little bastard.
GAME OVER.................................

ALIVE!
yeah though so
HE LIVES!
ZOMBEH!
ZOMBIE KILL HIM!!!! :O

I LIIIVE
Don't forget that Ethan swalloed poison.
I KNEW YOU WOULD MAKE ME FLY
according to mood whiplash standards, he had to have survived in this case
Oh shit.
good!, didnt want to break out ManUp.jpg for this one
HAVENT WE HAD ENOUGH SCARES?
"I STILL hate you for turning off the TV on me!"
And then he dies.
...so it was a trust exercise.
yay
suddenly poison kicks in
and then ded
So we have 2w main still alive.
yup
kick him in the nuts!
too bad we never got that doctor though...
So while a guy saves his son another guy fights the killer?
kill it its a zombie
Yeah
Isn't that lady supposed to help him or something?
She's dead.
she dead
Through a cheeseburger of the edge! He'll go after it! :O
She died in the doctor chapter.
Buytoast: its a she
dammit
FUCK HIM
Whaddya mean save you?
SAVE HIM
Fuck you you fat prick
hmm
Are you kidding?
LOVE AND TOLERATE
FUCKER!
not even a choice huh
then he dies
Oh come on damnit. Live Norman you bastard!
Oh Caramel...
did chat derp on me too?
i dont think there was even a choice
DONT PING HIM!
^^^
YOU KILLED MY BOYFRIEND
He's not trying.
HULK SMASH
Hey! its heavy rain
yes it did
nooooooooooooooooo
GAME OVERRRRRR
You see I would have had the same problem, I would have helped him too... I'm too nice.
LOLOLO
...Oh well.
:'(
Well there goes Norman.
Atleast Shaun and ethan are alive.
You killed him !
So...that's 2 dead, right?
yup
fuuuuuu
so
what was the other one?
Madison and Norman are dead.
Happy Ending! :)
let him die
Nope
33% happy ending
no happy ending
DIE
yeah
MASF123: Medium happy ending. :D
33%
Oh god
That picture
...You know, this is really a Downer ending.
2,14 strange, they changed the ending
Caramel: How so?
so wait, what was with his blackouts?
2,14 normally, if madison isn't alive, they shoot Ethan when he leaves the building
well that was ameusing
So...
He can still kill people?
Maybe it's because he had the kid with him.
He got grinded.
2,14 no, it didn't matter before
fuck jaydon had bad ass shades
2,14 which made it even more depressing
Norman died a hero....and a virgin.
I dunno then. Guess it's just fussy.
MASF123: dat spy
2,14 because shaun watched his dad die in front of him
They only shoot him if he goes alone, right?
ive never saw this ending before...
Caramel: Ah. Maybe some people thought it was toooo depressing and complained. So they slapped a coat of Mass Effect fixer on it.
That would have been really really depressing.
Or if Madison fails to get into the building?
d'aww...
2,14 probably
awwww
2,14 a shame, I was going for a super bad ending
Pft.
This is a depressing game...
2,14 with only one redeeming qualith
Norman is dead and all is well son, let me but you some Ice Cream.
2,14 which you will see shortly
You got a good ending for one character, atleast
:3
supah dupah bad ending is when....
Ethan is still foreveralone
Ethan...
handcuff to each other, and you shall never be seperated again
hey daddy, lets play kidnapper vs cops!
and this is Madison's worst ending.
lol he dead
BITCH!
Ungreatful
FUCK YOU!
Love and Ttolerate
that was corny
05back with coffee
stupid bitch
And pants I hope Wrek.
lol
Wrek: happynes in a cup
o hai Wrek
so what was with his blacouts then?
back with the motor oil i see Wrek
*blackouts
I dont think those were explained.
What happened to the fat guy again?
The fat guy got away.
oh
Will he kill again?

Polydunami: did you like Problem Sleuth?
therainbowvortex: Be extra careful man. :)
Seems Legit

It was incredibly crazy, MadSurge. And yet, it made sense :$
MrMalk: I should. It's not vegetarian heaven. :P
Polydunami: Homestuck is WAY more insane.
Oh my. Silent episode. :)
Oho, BGM episode!
Oh nice BGM ep time
Klumzeedragon thank celestia if it didnt have barbeque how do they expect texans to live?
I kind of figured that, MadSurge :$
Hey Jesus
MadSurge: I couldnt get into Homestuck. :D I do like Moonstuck however. :D
Hey Dude
I was bowling the other day and my sister hit pins in the lane next to us

MrMalk: That's still pretty awesome. :) So i'll have to keep it in mind.
Klumzeedragon: it gets weeeeiiiiiird :D
TrixieMuffin are you sure its the Vikings?
Hey Klimzeedragon!
00,02someone should make a version without just the voice
MrMalk: The people living there before everyone started showing up and claiming it. :P
i mean klumzeedragon
If Problem Sleuth became a ridiculous epic...
im getting this tablet http://reviews.cnet.com/tablets/sony-xperia-tablet-s/4505-3126_7-35426708.html
Then I can expect at least five times as much from Homestuck.
She's got a TIARA for a cutie mark, how does that make her better in any way??
MadSurge: Yeah. I've seen some pictures from it. And it looks like it gets pretty insane. :D
Hey what if happens if i pop out the different pony chat but leave the screen up?
Moopy: You're lucky I pay attention to the chat, cause you never ding me. :D So I almost miss your posts.
Moopy: But, sup?
Hey look at my question scroll up
MrMalk: :D
Isn't it you're in this context? :S
But noone is really limited to one special talent, despite the cutie mark system...
00,10Guess this is appleblooms theme

Quills and sofas, MadSurge? :3

Wow. Granny Smith has the same bad hip as I do.

Kencolt: So people just need to punch you in your hip and it's all good?
http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/26678169.jpg
Oh yeah, that too
Klumzeedragon: No-- Mine was all the way broken, so I had to have total hip replacement. I walk with a cane nowadays. Well, that comes with age and being the old guy here.
I thiiiiiiink... I want a plumb. o 3o

00,02for those of you who aren't engineers, 4E+14 is shorthand for 400000000000000
Phase4: But I suppose it's a good movie. Starts out with a kid who like model rocket ships, then wants to be an astronaught or something, I don't rightfully remember.
SuperBrony64|Zzz: Night you silly pony. :)
And that's a large number. 6_9
00,02Klumzeedragon, its my hax fuel tank
00,02for when i just want to get places

Yay I come back to finally see a Kerbal stream. :3
Makes perfect sense. I can see why you'd want to use teh hax tank.

AdamTheDuck: Funny thing. I said, "Where we're going, we dont need shoes!" To one of my drunk friends and he actually left the house and walked to the liquor store with out them.
00,02XD
00,02Klumzeedragon, probably shouldnt have let him go
needs moar rockets, moar hay bacon strips, moar wheels, bigger wheels
Nah all it needs is duct tape.
Lots and lots of duct tape.

Phase4: Especially homemade loud ones. :P But yeah. We went looking for him and some people said they saw him stubbling in a direction, so we guessed where he was going. :D
13uh phase
13i think it broke
00,02i screwed up the staging a bit
Phase4: what has been your largest rocket/flying machine
00,02where did my rocket go
Ah. So that's what the struts are for... They arent doing their job.
00,02Prick, that would probably be apolo, my badly spelled attempt at a 3 stage
Hallow!
Hello CrazyCherry
00,02ohai CrazyCherry
00,02should probably secure the lander a bit
00,02and then crazycherry left
00,02oh and the rocket exploded
Boooooooooooooooooooom
00,02it may be a bit heavy
It needs to be able to lean back just a bit more.

13uh sir, you lost some of your cargo about a mile back
13also one of your tail lights is out
Phase4: Get your ship higher up? Put some blocks under the wheels?
00,02that looks much nicer
13put the rocket on cinder blocks? :3
00,02i've got a better idea
Yes. So it's not a harazd to anypony anymore. :P
13so because it's almost 4am... i just wiki'd "cinder block"
13TIL they're called that because they're made from ash and cinders
13NOOOOOOW YOU KNOOOOOOW
00,02that should work
Phase4: Yeah, That's pretty much what I meant. :D

Prick: Definitely sounds delicious. o 3o
00,02or
wooooot, back with some nachoes to watch Phase4 crash some more :$
that was a quick sandwich...pretty much
Phase4: Thtat... sounds like the most logical thing to do. Why havent you done that yet? :D
prick you need a aussie bbq
now I think about it, I've never had Nachoes in my life...just never tryed nor had em
Prick: I have never put BBQ Sauce on my sandwiches... May have to try that.
But it's just corn chips with melted cheese and salsa sauce o.o
And Nachoes are pretty great. Depending on how you like them.
00,02ololololo
:D
DED
Omg that was so unexpected
wtf happend
oh Phase4 make it into a helicopter!
13mun plane debris is already on the runway
13LIKE A KERB
Phase4: WTF
13ROCKETS GONNA ROCK
13etc
AdamTheDuck: I like mine with cheese, sour cream, refried beans, salsa. And sometimes... Guacamole.
00,02so that happened
13very efficient splosion
I add a little chopped spring onion :3
phase4 crash into buildings
13leaves nothing behind for pesky investigators to find
Phase4: Is this a thing now? You exploding your rockets all over the place?
thats what she said
00,02hmmmm
phase4 make it crash in buildings
AdamTheDuck: Whatever works. :P I'll probaby have Nachoes for lunch in... 10 hours.
JRP|laptop: there's no buildings tall enough :D

She really does... And at least a song or two to herself.

Mmm Sandvich
Weird map. o 3o
Evening everypone
Hello XAX
Hullo XAX
Hey Klumzeedragon!
What's up Moopy? :)
Do you think you might be able to play duke nukem with me?
I don't have duke nukem Moopy. :P
I thought you did?
A long time ago, I sold it as soon as I beat it.
Wait superbrony64 has it
No pony mods Phase4? :P
hey everypony it is i
hey dude
Hello therainbowvortex
And yeah, SB64 said he had like a copy for everything. And 2 for the PS3.
hey Moopy told ya id be back
WOW, girl playing TF2? :D
Can he stream it over the air so that way i can be on the air dude?
dat 360! xD
Ohai XAX and Gold_Demona!
Hiyo MadSurge
Gold_Demona: fucking Bobsled Bonanza D:<
IKR?
This map is weird. O_o
I have no idea Moopy. I don't tell him what to stream. :D So ask him next time you're both on. Just remember, he usually streams to late for you to be on.
too*
awwww
Gold_Demona: I already had enough trouble with Zombotany, and now there's a second too!
MadSurge: I wow, yeah. That one's such a pain.
MadSurge: I eventually got it though.
00,02Klumzeedragon, there is one pony mod
Gold_Demona: the thorn minefield strategy worked well, but what about Zombotany 2? I'm afraid :(
00,02Klumzeedragon, i meen i have one installed
Oh. :D Which one?
MadSurge: Lots of tallnuts, lots of spikeweed, and if you have the Imitater, use it as a flower so you get more flowers faster.
Gold_Demona: last plant to buy, incidentally
MadSurge: I usually use imitater flowers anyway cuz I like having lots of flowers really fast.
Dat Spy check. :D
MadSurge: Also having a frozen peashooter in every row helps early on.
Gold_Demona: Yay, achievement! :D
Yay!~
:D a mime potato!
lol, Yup. I love it
ImiTATER. Get it? XD
Column Like you See 'Em was easy
Yeah, that one's cake.
That derpy poster. :D
Hey phase4 what did that picture say sex makes what?
00,02babies
Gold_Demona: where does the yeti zombie appear?
MadSurge: It appears randomly
oh
MadSurge: Mostly in the story mode.
Gold_Demona: is it special in any way?
Like a boss. Just stand there and eat a sandwich while everything blows up around you. xD
MadSurge: Not really. It's kinda tough, but once it gets low in health, it runs away
Gold_Demona: :| instakill plants is the answer.
Hey is that how they die by laughing like that?
MadSurge: Like the tater mine? I love using those early on.
MadSurge: And the squash is nice too. :3
Gold_Demona: I personally prefer catapults and squashes. :D
00,02we need pony surf servers
MadSurge: My only problem with catapults is they're more expensive and slower. They're not good at the beginning.
Make one? :P
MadSurge: I start out with regular peashooters and frozen peas and then as I go, replace them with melons.
MadSurge: Also pumpkins are very handy
listen to JayJay
Gold_Demona: I keep on forgetting I can replace plants *facepalm*
MadSurge: Da shovel is your friend. :D
Just make your own Phase4?
Gold_Demona: also that final boss was nice, not too easy, not too hard
00,02Klumzeedragon, my vps's are still down
MadSurge: Yeah, I really like the final boss.
00,02hence why no berrypunch
MadSurge: He was a pain in the butt at first, but once I figured out what I was supposed to be doing, it was fun.
Ah... Makes sense. :)
Phase4 what the hell was that slide thing you just did?
Moopy, surf maps?
oh
I was like "aha, freeze! Burn! The asskicking has been doubled!" :D
MadSurge: Also. Rake. Always. Buy. The rake.
Applejack witha violin <3
Hmmm this is a good song phase4
These are so weird. I havent joined any random servers like that before. I've only played the multiplayer and mvm. XD;
Gold_Demona: but it just takes out one zombie in three stages :(
MadSurge: So?
MadSurge: You can buy it again
MadSurge: After third turn, just buy it again.
00,02Moopy, its called surfing
00,02and yeah, its a nice song
MadSurge: More time to set yourself up at the beginning of a stage.
cool
MadSurge: It's like having a free potato mine at the beginning of the stage.
night evrypony ive gota go runing tomorow
Night therainbowvortex! :)
00,02really need a mouse for this
Phase4, What is this? Don't touch the floor?
00,02Klumzeedragon, its surfing

Ah. I havent seen you get to a surfing part yet, else I would have known. :D

Wrek: Welcome home and back~ :P
Hey Ninjazz. :)
^_^
Wrek and Ninjazz: hello!
Gold_Demona: also I should sell my plants more :O
That /robot. :D
MadSurge: I always sell my garden plants after they give me diamonds. After that they're not worth keeping.
Plants Vs. Zombies?
MadSurge: Also, they sell for quite a bit when they're full grown. =)
He's going to gut me like a cornish...?
Ninjazz: Yup
Aha. Thought so.
MadSurge: Cornish Game Hen I assume
Gold_Demona: 8000$ is niiice
MadSurge: I know, right?
00,02i'ma wait this map out

Ponies47, it's a surfing server
CrimsonPhoenix: I suck at those :/
So Phase4, it's ok if I post a link at the end of each song until told otherwise? :3
Ponies47, maybe it's because you don't really know how to play it?
00,02AdamTheDuck, sure

CrimsonPhoenix: Yeah. Guess so.
Phase4, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjPb2HJl0Co

Klumzeedragon.......he killed......jayden?.............FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Phase4: yah
Phase4: And if you fon't know how to work your mods there's a video somewhere on youtube that shows you exactly how and were to unzip the folder.

cachi01|phone: Yeah... sadly. :D
00,02i'm good

00,02listening to this again because awesome

DerpDash: Nope. You're good. :P
00,02DerpDash, ah, was wondering
Phew...thats a relief
Phase4: It is awesome. Totally liked and faved this song. :D
00,02skyrim is a platformer right?
Lolno.
Best platformer. :P
It's a Space Oddesey Oprah MMORPG.
Opera*
Oprah...
^^
I like the Oprah better.
and suddenly most overrated game on stream
of 2011
ikr?
Makes me want to play my Skyrim... I'll do it tomorrow. For now, I sleep. It's 4:35am. :P
Bronysith: Maybe overrated. Still good. :D
Klumzeedragon: not really
Far from best but good. :D Opinions is opinions though.
*are
Nope. Is.
and it is not an opinion, skyrim IS friggin overrated
I said what I meant and I meant what I said.
OmG Avast Your Ass Remix tiem
And I agreed, no? It is overrated. It's not a bad game though.
so many yays :D
fallout is a far better game
Bronysith: Not arguing there.
skyrim is just so boring and repettive and not immersive whatsoever
and i am talking about fallout 1 and new vegas
It has it's moments.
i love fallout 1 and new vegas
G2G to school everypony. Cya :)
fallout 3 was good though, i just enjoy new vegas better
:3 D'aww Flutters so happeh
cachi01|phone: Have fun. :)
Cya, cachi01|phone. Take care.
Bye cachi01|phone
ByeBye cachi01|phone
00,02so
00,02thats not working
ragdolls
Bronysith: Exactly what Im saying with Skyrim. Good, but tons of things are better. I prefer most of my N64 games over it, still good. :D
skyrim facepalms
EVERYWHERE
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Spaaaaaaaace
fallout 1 is probably the most immersive game i have played besides amnesia
Bye Everypony! I miss ur faces already :'(
Bye DerpDash
brb~
you can kill everything in fallout 1 with no limits
Did you get the space core mod Phase4?
important quest giver?
killed
children?
killed
Bye DerpDash. :)
Bronysith: Sounds like Morrowind.
00,02only mod i have installed right now is the derpy one
I don't have skyrim for the PC. What does your Derpy mod do Phase4? :O
00,02Klumzeedragon, horse is derpy
Sweet. :D And nice knee shots.
00,02ok
00,02new plan
00,02i'ma sneak past
But right. As I was saying. Bed time. Good night every pony! :) Thanks for streaming Phase4. Next time you're on TF2 we should MVM or Mann Up. :P
And enjoy your Derpy Scout.
Finish Him!
00,02he lost his lute
Gnight, Clumseylizard. sleep well.
ello
00,02great
00,02the door is on the OTHER side of the mountian
Nords are probably the easiest thing to kill in Skyrim
just defeat
Ooh, I like that the giants give you a warning and don't just go "beep boop attack player on sight"
darn i want skyrim
hazard: no you do not
badly
not worth the hype
like at all
yes i do
Almost looks like he's riding an invisible horse when he jumps up the mountain
Dat jumping :D
:3
skyrim is in no way worth the hype it gets
nah my friend told me some ways ta get ta be best on that game and i wanna try them
Skyrim got hype because of one thing. The mods.
and "ERMGHAERD DRAGONS"
Everyone knew that once it got released, the mods will come rolling in.
psssh
dragons have been implemented in games before
Unfortunately, Beth made it harder to make mods.
but Everyone creamed their pants when they saw dragons in skyrim
double mouse :<
Bronysith: except Fluttershy
I was more interested in the trailer music.
nyah
it is just the morrowind theme
With a Nordic choir.
it is bullshit
It spawned a meme that everyone except idiot kids hates
Skyrim is just one giant meme
everyone and their mother and their mothers dog knows what skyrim is
wow
00,02i fixed the trap
then i have dumb friends then
Phase4 + not looting everything, this doesn't make sense
they had no clue what i was talkin about when i said skyrim
dark souls is the true game of the year for 2011
Bronysith: "prepare to die", that's all the meme you need eh? :D
00,02well i'm trying to get somewhere
MadSurge: that isnt a meme
dark souls truly challenges the player
you are just some unfortunate person in there
instead of "chosen one, not slay a dragon"
that is the entire bullshit "story" for skyrim
Your first mistake was caring about the story.
...
i just want it so i can max out some weapons status and randomly slaughter people
Whaaaaaa, I care about story! :|
hazard: it gets boring
so do all games if ya play them enough
Heck I even have some games which are just completely story :/
so what? RPGs are best known FOR THE STORIES
chrono trigger, FF7, ff6 ff10 had great stories
about 200 hours
the games were great
This is Bethesda. In today's current gaming market.
skyrim is just side quests
"Today's gaming market" ...
That feeling when you look at society today...
games today cater to casuals
00,02what is this i dont even
http://cheezburger.com/6580532992
Trapped forever!
Avast me harty
00,02i'm stuck
The funny thing about our society. We think it changes so much, and in a sense it does, but I recently watched a show from back in the 90s that had some heavy social commentary, and it pretty much expresses exactly how society is today.
Kinda adds another layer to "The more things change, the more they stay the same"
le 9gag is way better than le cheezberger XD
http://cheezburger.com/6576525824 AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH SO FUCKING TRUE
00,02HA AH
that is my fav hunting grounds
00,02Bronysith, the what now?
Phase4: the quarry junction in fallout new vegas
Phase4, oh don't worry, Fallout New Vegas joke
00,02ah
I get the feeling Fallout's another game series I'm gonna have to get when I'm not poor. :P
cheezburger and 4chin steal all le 9gag memes
Gold_Demona, eeyup :P
why do they do this
Gold_Demona: new vegas is better than fallout 3
just saying
Better? But I liked Fallout 3's story more :<
Liam Neeson is your dad!
AdamTheDuck: so? yes
I'm most interested in New Vegas and whatever game Fallout Equestria is based on. Fallout 2 I was told?
fallout 3 had better story AdamTheDuck
Liam Neeson for the win! =D
See, Liam Neeson makes everything better :D
He was a jedi master AND furry jesus.
/me smacks Gold_Demona
Gold_Demona: liam neeson was never a jedi
Bronysith: Wasn't he Qui gon Jin?
:< blasphemy!
Gold_Demona: prequels are non canon
Bronysith: Suit yourself, dude.
Guys.
http://appft.com
But... Liam Neeson...
XAX: oy this is a gift from RX
/me murders XAX by ripping his soul from his body
right.
Bronysith: Whether they were canon or not has nothing to do with the fact taht Liam played Qui gon. :P
He WAS a jedi.
Canon or no
It would help if I knew who RX is.
he just starred in a shit film
RX Sweetie-bot.
RX-78-Grimlock
Oh.
Bronysith: Your point? It still happened.
I see.
Judgey judgemental pants
i get the feeling that games are just going downhill from now on
catering to casuals
thats goign downhill
Good morning, everypony! :)
ArmA 3 is still keeping me optimistic :P
nyah
Judgey judgementalness
Mornin' RaveBrony
i still need to play earthbound
ill play it after school today
/me waves to AdamTheDuck
Who is this streaming? :o
RaveBrony, that would be Phase.
Ah, ty :)
Phase4: the puzzle solution is on the claw
Try all the combinatations!~
Look at the claw Phase, lol
:P
wrong mouse Phase4 :P
Woohoo
00,02XD
myah
i need to play earthbound
Gold_Demona: and you need to play legend of dragoon
Bronysith: Have to take the time to get a working PS emulator first. :P
Yeah!
Bronysith: I R lazy
Gold_Demona: legend of dragoon is an awesome cult classic
Bronysith: So I hear
Working PS emulator?
i kind of wish Dragoon sold better
._.
00,02and then i died
but not at the same time
Playstation?
ePSXe.
00,02failed so hard skyrim crashed
did you save the game Phase4 ? :D
because then it would be too overhyped like FF7 which is still good
XAXphone Yeah, it's just a pain to get it working right
00,02which is aparently not very hard at all
Lol, Phase4 :D
Crashed? Haha :D
Gold_Demona: ...true. You have no idea how long I spent fishing for working, decent plugins.
There's no automaticness like there is with cartridge emulators
Pretty much suck at all games :<
00,02FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
00,02speedrun time
half life in half an hour

Well time for school/ No pony know's what is going to happen today. For someone saw me wearing my brony wristband and started spreading it around the freakin school trying to see if they could figure it out. :/
Well have fun at school Ponies47
Frankly no one cares I'm a brony at my school :$
dude at my school if i say im a brony i get killed im dead serious
hazard: Oh come on it can't be that bad
Somehow, my friend freaked out when he saw my Desktop Ponies.exe on my desktop.
Good luck, Ponies47!
mfw. ._.
Phase4: there was a hidden door that led outside
plus a chest
00,02Prick, also it was hidden
00,02and thus i could not see it
:D
/me Hugs RaveBrony "I'm gonna need that"
Logic :D
/me hugs Ponies47
/me gives Ponies47 a good luck lick :P
Ninjazz: Which desktop ponies? :$
Anyways. Bye everypony :)
Cya, Ponies47. Take care.
/me sets Ponies47
on fire
/me Puts himself out
cya Ponies47
RaveBrony, I had no ponies on my desktop. He just saw the .exe on my desktop.
/me Throws Bronysith into the river
I had a friend over a while back that had just come back from Australia for a few weeks. He came over and saw my wallpapers, and didn't mention it once.
AFTER he saw it, we went through the list and got some ponies.:D
All the not caring.
Ninjazz: Oh, haha :P
05so i reworked my desktop today
Bye!
Oh? :o
ohai Wrek
Wrek, organizing is always fun.
Cya Ponies47
oh hey Wrek didnt know you were here
XAXaphone, could be worse.
Phase4: my dad taught me sumthin new when ever i play game, gotta look in every nook and crany to find the goodies
Skyrim mountain surfing to epic music :D
05lemme screenshot it
00,02Prick, but thats boring, theres dragons to find
Wrek: what did yhou do to your desktop? mod the crap out of it?
I always look everywhere in games. :$
i just burn everything
Most of the time i find nothing tho.... haha
Ninjazz: Explain how. He also saw my RD boot screen.
XAXaphone, he could have /cared/. Then again, he could have been happy about it too.
grrr, i need chrono trigger
Derpy!~
my favorite mlp mods are the City Shields
I put one wallpaper on a computer no really uses and everyone freaks out. -_-
So what 'type' of games do you like Bronysith?
AdamTheDuck: good games
ARROW TO THE KEEN
That's a very general answer, good can be interpreted many ways by different people
KNEE*
Final fantasy 7,6 and chrono trigger are my favorite game AdamTheDuck
they tied for first
coulda been worse
coulda been to the spleen
or the femur
broken femur is the worst pain
._.
huh my grandpa brok his femur
it is funny cause max payne and the courier both got shot in the head
then they get revenge and such
but a nord in skyrim gets an arrow in the knee
and gives up on life
05http://i.imgur.com/0pYNh.jpg
Yep
wow then that nord wasnt realy a great adventurer
Wrek: O.O Woah

00,02otakon, dragon bones and scales
Phase4: oh yeah you ALWAYS keeps dragon material
Phase4: makes some of the best armor in the game
Phase4, also that's 500 value, that is alot less depending on your speech skill
^
00,02AdamTheDuck, i know, its anoying
Phase4: dont keep dragon bones and scales this early. You wont use them till much later
i have played skyrim on xbox 360 and i know so much things Xp

Well anyway, night guys

When can you make armor?
*make the armor
RaveBrony: the dragon armor? When you get max level (100) in smithing
seach there
RaveBrony: it takes quite some time

MadSurge: Oh yeah, he suggested using two rows of flowers instead of just one
MadSurge: VERY helpful hint.
Phase4: the other logo you saw (the mortar) was the alchemy shop.
Gold_Demona: Yeah, but in story mode you rarely have the chance to use that
Gold_Demona: better for Survival I bet
00,02Alchemist, i thought it was a tankard
MadSurge: Chance? I always use two rows.
Who doesn't use two rows x_x
Phase4: I always saw it as a flaming mortar :D
Gold_Demona: I tend tp plant only one and put in a ton of plants :D
00,02this game has nice visuals
yep
MadSurge: It's hard to put a ton of plants if you don't have a lot of sun, though.
00,02and then it crashed again
tip: you can use dragon scales and bones them to create an armor but you gona need to lvl up your smithing to 100
MadSurge: You can get better plants faster if you have more flowers
Phase4: lower your settings?
I always end up with the zombies arriving too close to the plants if use two rows :(
00,02hurry up and sync
oblivion crashed all the time when I alt tabbed, didnt have much trouble with skyrim.
oy otakon whats up?
not much Bronysith how you been?
ohai
MadSurge: That's why you have to use the rake and plant either pea shooter or tater mine as soon as the first zombie pops up. And keep planting flowers. And plant shooters or mines as needed
otakon: good, my first class was cancelled so i dont have to leave for about another 20 minutes lol
then i just have 1 class and done for the week
Bronysith: nice
Ohai otakon

Bronysith: not yet
DERPY!
otakon: DO IT NAAAAAOOOW
RUN DERPY RUN!
otakon: there is a huge reveal in it
Phase4: you can't cast spells on horseback
TheDamShadow01: yeah, I never understoidd why you couldnt make dragon weapons in vanilla.
Alchemist: oversight or DLC shenanigans most likely
Alchemist: cause skyrim is an incomplete game
Alchemist: yep :P
Derpy pony!
otakon: watch the new turnabout storm now
00,02derpy cares not for your physics
i best get going to class now, fucking traffic

What's a "payphone"?
03 Heya
Hey SlurryMoon :)
Hello SlurryMoon and SuperBrony64!
11,02Hey MadSurge :3

11,02SlurryMoon: It was leaked that Black Ops II is confirmed on Wii U :)
11,02TheDamShadow01: Wii U Media event

Oh, That's what a payfone is.
:o i never greeted you, SuperBrony64! Hello! :D

11,02MadSurge: Okies o3o
Good morning, Miss Cheerilee
03 :3 so excited
11,02My Body is Reggie
11,0266 DAYS :D
11,02November 18th :D
lol
03 xD
SuperBrony64: also I need only one exit to reach the final level of NSMB2 :)
Tovember 18th?!
Am I the only one who thinks of this every single time I hear the name WiiU? http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7cmtob9fI1qjsrqoo1_1280.jpg
I wish my wallet was reggie
11,02Like a month before Japan :3
03 mhm, that's sounds a bit silly, but okay x3
00,02wii uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Wii U Wii U Wii U~
11,02As soon as this ends, I'm going to wait outside my GameStop :3
00,02he's got a 'not bad' face on
>.>
11,02Till Launch :I
Wii U is a silly name. I'm naming mine Black Betty.
Tovler: Isn't Betty a... woman's name?
wii u wii u wii u..... nooooo thats not my tipe D:
11,02Basic Set
Gold_Demona: XD
00,02HIGH SPEED CABLE
03 w/ NIntendo Land xD
11,02Darn...forced to get black ><
00,02SuperBrony64, once you go black you'll never go back
11,02Deluxe set it is :3
03 indeed
lol
Nintendo Land... best theme park ever?
:( I have to pay more for Black Betty?
Well, I don't want White Wilma, so...
00,02what if i want a delux one, but in white
00,02oh neat, dont need to rebuy controllers
ALMOST all?
Which ones don't work?
Wild Wiimote appeared
trollers XD
Third-party controllers maybe?
He said Almost all games. Which games don't work?
00,02Jmo, the third party extention stuff was mostly standardized
11,02$299 for BASIC
00,02its controlled in software
hm
11,02$349 for DELUXE
00,02good pricing
00,02less than the wii was at launch iirc
That's not terrible for a brand new system.
:'( deluxe your bad D:
11,02Wii launched at $249
11,02GAMES :D
pretty sure the Wii was NINJA'D
That's better than PS3's $599
00,02oh yeah, that happened before AUD to USD was about 1:1
No cheering. Everyone is so polite.
I still remember the PS3 launch price here. My god.
professionalism at a gaming event?
Jmo: I remember it was YEARS before the PS3's price was brought down to "manageable".
00,02Tovler, no wai
And I still don't own one
Indeed Gold_Demona.
Notendo?
00,02only reason i have a ps3 is because its broken
00,02found it on a junk heap
Heh!
00,02read: side of the road
lol
At least US was smart enough to bundle NintendoLand
00,02dat massive cable
i wanna buy wii u but.............. no money :'(
00,02i hope thats a demonstration thing
gona see if a get money at Nov 18
I just spent 350 fixing my car :(
00,02this will be interesting
Beats the hell out of WiiSports
00,02its like multiplayer except no one can complain about peaking
11,02I need to freeze myself for the new Wii U...66 days is just too long >>
This gamepad thing is probably the most interesting gimmick Nintendo's come up with yet.
00,02Gold_Demona, i think its less 'most interesting' and more 'most usefull'
Phase4: Which is WHY it's more interesting.
00,02gona make cross platform stuff interesting though
They still haven't given a price on the Gamepad alone.
00,02Tovler, sb quoted one earlier
00,02$170 iirc
Why would the gamepad be alone?
00,02Gold_Demona, i think you can attach two
Ah
11,02But that's for Japan, Japan always gets gyped out on conversions
Eventually, the WiiU will support 2 of 'em
11,02I say it'll cost $100 in the US
o.o
11,02For the love Nintendo, just show me Black Ops II running on the console XD
00,02this looks like the same engine as mario galaxy
And I have to buy Black 2, Code of Princess, and Paper Mario 3D.
00,02which is good, that was a suprisingly good engine
11,02Wii U comes out in Europe on Novemeber 30th!
08,01dooo doo doooooo
pikmin lol
11,02WOOOOO
WOO PIKMIN

11,02Lego GTA :3
....Talking lego characters? o_o
11,02fixing ><
>.>
So, just Lego City, NL, and NSMBU?
lol
03 Well, he's only talking about Lego City because it's published by Nintendo
00,02o_O
03 I'm pretty sure the 3rd party titles are coming up
00,02>Nintendo
00,02>3rd party
00,02O_o
Give us more Treasure games!
03 I mean the "published by 3rd party" are coming up
like Code of Princess?
11,02inb4 heart sensor

00,02blivingroom
03 I play mine in the Bathroom
11,02Nintendo TV :D
00,02inb4 dvd player
Islam has 5 pillars. just sayin'
00,02what what?
00,02wait'
00,02XD
PFFF
TVii
ohhhh orly?
inb4 sued by Apple for Apple TV
11,02This seems like what they are doing in Japain
Ohgawd that is a terrible pun.
11,02Japan*
Dat JaPAIN.
11,02:3
o u x3
11,02Wow
I hope you can change those icons, cause I would turn the football into a controller.
I'm glad they didn't show this at e3 or I would have had to set fire to something.
Oooh!
boring
I'm liking the football features
My husband would LOVE that
11,02Nintendo is infringing on the copyright of the Vii
11,02SUE EM
smart phones have been doing that for a while
00,02i like how they pop the ii in
00,02like its a joke
00,02its funny
They're nice and comfy
/me glomps Phase4
/me 00,02hugs SuperBrony64 back
00,02those chairs dont look comfy, and i know chairs
lol
11,02As soon as this is over, I'm going to try and preorder this system at GameStop :I
ffffff… I'll get one next spring.
11,02Also, yes, I would watch My Little Pony on the Wii U :3
00,02i'll get one when my wii stops being funn
Buy Wii U just to watch MLP.
HUZZAH~
yeah
11,02Wii is still fun...which is why the Wii U includes backwards compatibility :)
This is actually a good selling point for me.
Ponies on wii u? :O
MLP :)
Might just be worth it xD
I'll buy if we get a good MLP game on wiiu.
11,02BREAKING: Reggie likes Breaking Bad :3
00,02SuperBrony64, backward compatible to gamecube as well?
00,02probably not
lol
11,02Phase4: No :<
03 only wii
if only Reggie said I'm a big My Little Pony fan
nope
00,02inb4 people hack it in
just wii
11,02Wii games won't be upscaled on the new system >>
Reggie also likes NBC's Revolution.
11,02As long as the system plays Netflix, I'm good on TV content :)
Me too
yep me too
00,02SuperBrony64, depending on how nintendo responds, that might be possible to softmod in
11,02But that tune in option on TV is pretty awesome
00,02homebrew channel on the wii is prety nice
Tovler: we still have Andrew W. K. :$
11,02Phase4: It's already confirmed to have Netflix
00,02SuperBrony64, i ment the upscaling
00,02and to a lesser extent gamecube compatability, which would be possible for someone clever to do with relitive ease
11,02I somehow doubt this thing will be as easily hackable as the Wii :o
hmm, Rango can be picked for A movie
I REALLY like the sports option.
00,02hopefully
yep
00,02the wii's security bugs were prety funny
00,02(difference betwene strncmp and memcmp and stuff like that)
lol
11,02What I was hoping for was 'Reggie Reccommends: My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic' :3
lol
>.>
I'm mildly pleased at seeing Sandlot
>.>
11,02So yeah, screw the iPhone 5, Nintendo owns :3
Oh. Speaking of phones, I just got a smart phone. Sorta yay.
00,02ew, modern family
Noooooooooo
Parks and Recreation is better
11,02THIS

11,02With a system like this, we don't even need BronyState...wait a min... o-o
SuperBrony64: NO!

THE HORROR!
NOOOOOOO
00,02SuperBrony64, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
thanks kinixys and TheDamShadow01 :)
11,02Too bad the Wii U...is to be...unofficially discontinued...on December 21st :O
That is a REALLY useful feature. Hey, what's the link to this video so I can show it to my husband later.
03 ?

00,02to be replaces by the wii u lite
03 Where did you hear that?

11,02Mayans.
03 oh

lol
00,02oh yeah the whole 2012 thing
Getting a job will be so easy on Dec 21.
00,02i've not died yet so it keeps slipping my mind
11,02NINTENDO

03 it's skipping...
ALL of the YouTubes!
and Hulus
... now we need WiiTubes... and WiiTubesU ... and YouTubesU... lol ... UtubeU
00,02bundling with a game is the best way to sell a console
11,02If this had come out in 2006, Nintendo would have been WAAAAAAAY ahead of the curve.
00,02SuperBrony64, so far ahead infact that the silicon would not be practical yet :P
11,02:P
Phase4 yes, to quote Reggie 2011 "If it's true, that Software sells Hardware, than nobody sold as much consoles as Mario"
(I had 300 dollars ready! F*** my car!)
11,02Bayonetta O.o

03 I'm pretty sure both, SB
Now, this looks much better :D
yep
11,02Okay, I think THIS game was the exclusive for the Wii U and not Bayonetta
U
Thats Project P-100 (working title)
SuperBrony64: that makes more sense
03 xD
11,02The video just delayed a bit XD
The Wonderful 100?

ahem 101
00,02XD

it's literally a band of superheroes

A rock band of superheroes?
Pikmin meets little kings story
03 nope, Bayonetta 2 is in fact an exclusive, same with wonderful 101
A boy band of superheroes?

03 Tovler, it does more
Tovler now, it's importand to see how the quality of these games are
00,02read: making sequles
11,02Skylanders :)
03 :P
We can play games on it? I'm sold! :D
SuperBrony64: ugh, this is YOUR fault
11,02otakon: :<
wow shitty graphics
00,02huh
I mean the hell?
Will the Gamepad register Skylander figurines?
it looks like a PS2 game
00,02they've got a bit here
it's the WiiU!
NOT a PS2 it's capable of more than this
11,02At least there's no stupid Kinect controls :3
SuperBrony64: yet
11,02007 :O
still the hell is this this shit is last gen
lol
otakon how can you jusdge the grafics? IT#s a 360p Video restreamed -.-
These graphics are horrible for all of the games so far
Golden Eye is dead, lets move on.
Lil_B: bc jaggies and flat textures, it's PS2 graphics
11,02otakon: That's because they are showing off crap games they make
Hasbro property?
SuperBrony64: agreed and the point I was trying to make
More 007!
THE FUCK
those missiles were BIGGER THAN THE PLANE
00,02if they make an mlp:fim game for the wii u i will buy
11,02Oh come on...where's Call of Duty...I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE
what SENSE does that make?
00,02SuperBrony64, activision trolled you :P
yeah all these Activision titles look like PS2 releases
00,02its going to come out, dont worry
first release PS2 games at that
for shame Activison, FOR SHAME
11,02Phase4: Somepony snapped up the preview room after this event, there's a Black Ops II booth
00,02i'm not actually sure which one that is
SuperBrony64: fast forward past Actishition would you?
00,02dont care much for the cod franchise
i zhould gt the wiiu real bad
where is Nitt when you need him?
11,02otakon: I'll repeat it again, just for you :3
11,02YES
00,02'the game'
man, Activision sucks.
^
11,02BLACK OPS II

SuperBrony64: -___________- get a goddamn 360
11,02Please bring Wii Remote controls to this ;A;
:D
SuperBrony64: oh wait nvm you have one
11,02otakon: Have one, not interested :3
FUCK YOU CoD!
moar liek Call of Booty: Black c__ks 2.
what I don't like about the 007 game is that it's just the Wii game, that got remade for the PS3 and XBox360 and now ported back to the WiiU
11,02FOR THE LOVE
FUCK YOU YOU CHEAP RELEASE A YEAR BULLSHIT!
11,02Stop buffering

Someone is mad/
Lil_B: and it looks WORSE

oh shut UP
orly?
i hate this guy so much right now
neat how it's on the little screen too
00,02huh, graphics on the screen look nice
00,02mostly in the textures
Phase4: agreed, hell you could probably PLAY just on the GamePad
Phase4: don't even need to hook it up to a TV
00,02otakon, i think thats whats happening
otakon again... it's a freaking 360p Video yes, the textures looks bad this way, but I will NOT judge something I haven't see myself in the grafics they are supposed to have... in short... I jusge it when I see it in 1080p
11,02KILL CAM :D
Lil_B: THIS GAME looks like 360 games
"on a nintendo platform" That's not a glowing compliment
Lil_B: THOSE games looked like PS2 games
00,02weaponized quad rotor
Lil_B: THIS is the level of difference between those pieces of monkey shite and this
LEVERAGE
I bet you don't even NEED a TV for the WiiU
are they actually trying to tell us that choosing your loadout is NEW??
11,02YES
11,02Thanks for Wii Remote support :3
otakon it WAS a 360 Gamer, and you can't talk about 720p and 1080 p textures on a 360p Video
classic levrage
Game*
Lil_B: listen, those games earlier looked like shit, this does not. Graphically I mean.
oh yeah 2 zeprete fullsreenz
local multiplayer would be impossible without Wii Remote support
otakon ok
I wonder how much the controllers will coast
*cost
100 bucks a pop I say
anyone?
whats the point of even useing the tv
HELLO?
11,02I love you Nintendo ;~;
Singapore. That map sure looked exotic
Tovler well, the WiiU can use 2 Gamepads at once, but the Framerate will drop from 60 to 30fps, but Nintendo said they only did this because people where demanding it, it is planned as only 1 Gamepad per system
full epic singleplayer
4 hours
ofc the zombies
Zombies reveal. Wtb.
"1 full Activision singleplayer campaint"... yeah... sure
00,02just checked wiki, you can attach two gamepads
STOP RELEASING THE SAME GAME UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME YOU CHEAP FUCKS!
hm, a launch title
Phase4: cool though
yeah right, fuck you, suit guy
Phase4 but the framerate will be split between the 2
00,02Lil_B, probably
11,02Stronger than Zelda launch on the Wii? Explain.
BULLSHIT!
Phase4 no, they said it, it will be like this XD XD
... WOW they learned from the3DSs slow start
launch releases have ALWAYS been weak for Nintendo
00,02the only issue i really see with the gamepad is the forced awareness of your suroundings
where's that video from anyway? e3?
the N64 had only 3 start titles
00,02it hurts immersion
Lil_B: but one of them was Super Mario 64
03 lol Ubisoft has 8 games x3
I'll admit. I there are 5 must-have games here.
otakon and waverace 64 + one japan exclusive chess game
Tank!Tank!Tank!?
11,02Pikmin 3 is coming :D
03 xD
oh look another Warriors game
03 Pikumanz~
YES

11,02SlurryMoon: Moo :3
00,02Wii Fit U
Pikmin is where it's at.
wow... thats a lot of launch titles...
thank god THAT is over
/me glomps SlurryMoon

Lil_B: last time someone said that, it was shovelware
11,02So yeah...looks like I'm forced to getting the Black one XD
I'm still not sure if Epic Mickey 2 is also on WiiU
11,02With Black Ops II :3
00,02its disapointing that you cant choose colour
00,02i want a white wii
00,02not a black
MadSurge ok :/ well Retro Studios will hopefully not dissapoint
You can have any color you want, so long as it's black. :P
00,02Gold_Demona, :P
Lil_B: but if they did a Metroid that negated Other M I would jizz myself :D
oh look Madden
I want that Ledo Game!
ugh
00,02in my house: the wii is white, the ps3 is black, and the xbox is on fire
Lego*

Lil_B: ah

Phase4: dammit

Bayonetta 2, Wii U exclusive
brushet
brushet?
bullshit
ah
No it is not
05wonder if its visible on stream
05can you see the animated backround?
I see the buildings flicker
I see Jensen and rain
05yay
mitamaking: they're flickering bc of rain on the window
Bayonetta on a nintendo console, sounds pretty far-fetched to me
Is it a Heavy Rain?
Wrek: neat system monitor
05<3
IshSexiestPony: doable
mitamaking: -____-
IshSexiestPony: So was Resident Evil, Eternal Darkness, MGS, No More Heroes
Hello!
I just don't see how the sequel could be exclusive could be Wii U exclusive when the original was only on everything but the Wii
IshSexiestPony: Kingdom Hearts is a good answer I saw to that, FF7 comes to mind too, or Banjo 3
Sequel of what?
Same could be said for ME3 and ACIII on WiiU
Bayonetta 2 Vivix
Aah
Vivix: Bayonetta 2 on Wii U
TovlerU: Those are not exclusive is the difference
Perfect Dark Zero
05dammit
05guess im not playing PS2 just yet
05x3
Izzues?
Sonic Adventure 2
Se hvor vi vil masjere?
Are you listening to birthday song?
05hm?
I may have misheard that, when I came in it sounded like metal version of birthday song <,<
Nice desktop there
Admittedly, Wii exclusive Bayonetta does seem out of nowhere.
05thanks Kandarihu! set it up today :3
This type of news always comes out of nowhere, who saw FF13 on the 360 coming
Wait, that's his DESKTOP?
i was confused at the start too
05it sure is MadSurge
hellow
hiya

tower defense, S2 mode? that's awesome!
it's neat
Alchemist: those have been around since sc1. there loads of them by now
course the modders would jump at sc2
Dark_Horst: I've never played starcraft 1 or 2, so Im not familiar with mods/fan content
But I love the creativity I see modders have.
....are those supply depots?
Especially in minecraft
modders. gotta love em
Heya
especially the team that's working on the FO:E conversion
god, i cant wait for that
Dark_Horst: is it a conversion from FO3 or NV?
3
Dark_Horst: I can download it then!
yay
when it eventually comes out ofc
doesnt really matter though, sicne both use the same engine. and that will be the only thing they keep xD

Sup
Huh, looks pretty good
Hey Spademagnes[School]
I gotta share this with ya'll :) there were several thrunderstorms this morning, so my drive to Sheldon had the best view of the lightning show the entire commute - on the way back, the storms had moved westward a bit, still a lot of lightning and to the east - the sunrise painted the storm clouds moving north - and in between - a patch of clear sky
:o
It was Beautiful ^_^
Thats sounds amazing, Cypresswolf :)
I wish I could better share that mental picture
I found out recently my physical copy of Wind Waker could sell for a lot..

Hang on a minute i need to check something on halo waypoint on my xbox
05nope
05wont hang on
Can't you access Waypoint on PC?
I swear you could.
For me wrek not you guys
Halo Reach had the best custimisation
So many armor combos
And no i don't have a PC i have a sony valo compaq computer
It has so far.
LOL
>Don't have a PC
nope
> On this site.
...
i don't really like halo but i admit the forge mode was fun
Logic
i hate swat
The fun of forge mode was really nerfed in Reach
Swat was amazing in H3
Nerfed?
It was improved loads.
No in rech dude
So many options were added.
hiya DashWithRainbows
The best being rotation lock.
The place had a fucking huge map
DWR isn't here otakon. Don't know why you're saying hi to someone who isn't at their computer.
Tsk tsk.
GTFO
When I got a new xbox I lost my hybrusa helm :(
DashWithRainbows: you lie, LIE!
It was so awesome, only on halo 3.
Yeah its stupid
I got every skull in halo 3.. ALL OF IT GONE
DashWithRainbows: akin to a cloth covering that's flat on the ground.
I get randomly headshots out of no where
Could destroy tank.
05Moopy: becasue aim-assist
The only reason why I kept playing Reach was the assassinations.
05basicalyl built in aimbot
You could turn off aim-assist I think.
Well i get really mad about it
Fire fight online is fun
So much chaos
I prefer with out help when aiming.
Meh, firefight is alright.
I wanted one where you fight the flood.
heyo guys
Hiyo Eli
But i love playing the living dead on reach
or the Sentinals.
Oh god.
Infection.
hell yeah
All my babies.
Ifection can get chaotic
have them.
People shooting other people for no reason
Teh
05hmm
05well its too early for a movie or anything
D:
hi Gold_Demona what's up? Wrek & Deus?
Im just a big halo fan here
^

I love Halo
Can't blame you there.
05Eli: no its jsut my desktop

Whats the name of that facility map with multiple bridges in reach?\
Wrek: ah :) cool desktop then :P
I forgot the name
RaveBrony: class?
...
i forgot to go to class
hi Bronysith
Um, describe it more Spademagnes[School].
o_o
It was a ONI facility level in story
Um...
I know which one you're talking about.
Well im going to get on my xbox online to check something
Has a grav lift in the middle of the map, bottom floor?
Yea thats the one
how are things Bronysith
05how long untill 1pm PT?
argh
alexxm: good, you?
goddammit Hulu sucks now
FUCK YOU HULU
I still think the sandbox skull is the hardest one to get
i'm good Bronysith what have you been doing
/me escapes
It was, only because of the guardians.
alexxm: college
but a simple map overload done the trick.
hows it going Bronysith
fine
I read the skull can disapear when it overloads
05fun-fact: the "skulL" has been with bungie since the introduction of KTMWTB multiplayer mode since marathon
also, the map you were talking about Spademagnes[School] was called Sword Base.
funfact, i had chicken for lunch
05again
Oh yea.. sword base can be fun on infection
i still prefer Boneyard with Invasion.
05how long untill 1pm PT?
I do like that invasion level with the massive covenant tower
00,10PT wrek?
whats this then...
pacific time?
05yeh
I think it is almost half 10 in the morning wrek.

It is currently 1:30pm EST
05hmm

So 1pm PST is three hours from now... I think
00,10pst want be for another 2h30
05"We are currently targeting 1 PM PT to have this issue resolved. "
welcome to my world
Does SB live in PT?
05so aprox 2½ hours untill the PS2 servers are back up
05hmm

Movie!
00,10but yeah like I said last night wrek that was't a normal down time
Mornin' BState!
mornin...
00,10they were shuting down because servers were blocking external conections
something wrong Flyboy? :/
Hey Panda|Drawing and Flyboy
00,10morning Panda|Drawing
Panda|Drawing: ever been waiting for something for years, and then when you finally get the chance to do it, someone you know messes up that chance?
hi Panda|Drawing
thats my problem
Oh, and greetings, Sumica :o
Flyboy one word... females. XD
00,10hello
Panda|Drawing: how did you know...
/me huggles Sumica
/me puts Wrek in a full nelson
Flyboy I have been dealing with females for 18 years ^^ so...
40%cpu usage? where's all that going to?
/me waves at everypony else.
00,10Streaming
Panda|Drawing: D&D, DM's sister, annoyance, *BOOM* no more D&D...
didnt know it takes that much
00,10takes alot of the systems horsepower to stream and have it look good.
00,10takes even more to make it look bad
05Dark_Horst: stremaing in 1080p, scalign it down to 480p. music, torrents
05the like
Which is why laptops do not do good for gaming computers
Flyboy :/ oh man, when did that happen? Forgive me, I dont follow DandD
all of the stuff
Panda|Drawing: 5 minutes ago
And yet my dad thinks laptops are good for more than being able to move around....
Sumica not really ^^ I can stream perfectly in high quality
05it will spike to 70 maybe once i start the movie
Wrek D: movie? what movie?
Ok i just looked at my halo reach challenge and it said i have to do everything in firefight in matchmaking
What a load of bullshit... Laptops are good for web browsing and nothing else
kinda surprised you still have fluid FPS rates while streaming games
05Panda|Drawing: it will be a suprise
00,10well you stream good quality Panda|Drawing when you have your art stream.
00,10the quality drops grealy when you game
Spademagnes[School] -____- I have a laptop and I game, draw, and everything else.
Ohai guys :)
Sumica hmph, good point. I still havent over clocked my cpu though, its on my list.
Im pretty sure desktops are more powerful than laptops
hello MaxTheBrony!
00,10dont need to realy overclock it
Heya Panda|Drawing !
bah wasnt prepared for that
Hiyo MaxTheBrony
hi MaxTheBrony
how are things MaxTheBrony
the hell
00,10just need to make sure youoptmise some things or if you are like wreky
what is this?
Sumica, meh, I wanted to get more processing power and over clock the video card ^^
SWEET!

how are things GilDash
Hey GilDash!
He apperently feels he need to constantly watch what I'm doing
Alchemist this films really fameous how have you not heard of it
sup, GilDash?
His reason for saying no before I convinced him was "You can't move it"
hm... the bane of otakon is clop.... Ill make a note of that :3
alexxm: there are many "famous" western media that did not penetrate the iron curtain, and now people are not interested in older movies
oh ok Alchemist
00,10and for those that dont know hogens heros was loosly based on this.....or was it the other way around
HOGAAAAAAN!

Ponyloverforever: No. Swedish. I forget the title-- it's been YEARS since I saw this last. But it is famous in art film circles... and the title is on the tip of my tongue...
05seventh seal
Wrek: What is it about?
Oh, that's right... it's about the Black Plague and how people reacted to it, and a lot of personal drama and a chess game with Death.
Cult classic? O.o

You could say he couldn't bear it anymore.
Haha.

Wrek: Har du något med Nils Poppe?

"Vad e de.." I love the classic Swedish Accent. :D
xD
exactly
Hello everypony, sorry for missing out Heavy Rain the other day.
Heya VenHur
Back in the ages of Movies Dialogue, this was a time when pronounciation was IMPORTANT to make every viewer of the movie understand the word. And nowadays we have fo shizzle my baazzle nissle with some kizzle with da hood in the...
You get the point.
Vordox: point taken...my nizzle.
:P
05dat ass?
O.o dat peddo :3
Wrek: Better then a plot? :P
why is the baby bare assed?
its warm in sweden
otakon: Did Underwear exist in those time? :P
isn't it cold in Sweden?
05otakon: becasue medieval poverty
:p
No dipers i suppose
I SHAN'T!
Or a flank... [puts shades on] Don't sue me.
Vordox: yh, they were called small clothes and usually just a wrapping
otakon: Cold, HERE?!
horsey seems bored
otakon: You're speaking of the eastern part of the world. :P
With the Fundoshi
Skogs Smultron...<3
so
...Spis? Is this some sort of Danish/swedish?
05those smultron are over 50 years old
what is the point of this movie?
The life of a normal swed
05Vordox: spis as in stove, oven
05heating place
Aha
Damnit mixup of Swedish/Dainish
<--- How Swedes lives
All peace and stuff
UNdergarment, at this time, were mostly confined to the upper classes and nobility. The average peasant made do without. INfants were usually just wrapped up.
LOFE and Spis
Kencolt: Yep
Kencolt: sounds about right
an unchaste fish?
a lute!
I find it interesting about the old classic movies
I would like to learn to play a lute
So much more dialogue then nowdays, where staging and scening has taken a bigger peace of the moive.
peice*
05also
Piece*
xD
brb
05those arent strawberries
What are they?
Wrek: Wild Berries you mean?
smultron* vad hette det på engleska?
05MaxTheBrony: no idea
I think it's Wild Berries
05the original ones broke
ah
05had to get a 3rd party again
Oh, and that armor-- Nope. Any warrior who could afford mail wored a padded tunic under it-- otherwise that links in the mail would cut into his flesh just by wearing it, much less on impact. I know, I've worn the stuff.
BAH.
Kencolt: eeyup
just say milk
fresh milk
Wrek: So when is the next ACTION scene with explosions gore and blood, and sex of course, When?
also
I SEE NO COW
just a stallion
<--- That guy with the lute looks... DAMN familiar.
and you can't milk a stallion....
OH HAI evil
DEATH
Det är jag som är döden
O.o
ÄR det denna film :o
Sorry for swedish ...
Bergman didn't do explosions, IIRC. GOd help us if Michael Bay ever tried to make a remake of this film.
haha , i would rather die than see a Bay addaptation of this movie.
Wrek: What's the name of the actor? With the lute?
He looks familiar.
05wait for credits
Wrek: Jof was it?

MadSurge: yeah , The Seventh sea

05Nyst: its swedish as it was 50 years ago
Quickie Trivia: Both Van Halen and Scott Walker (from his album Scott 4) have named a song after The Seventh Seal, both are inspired by the Bergman film. The Van Halen one also mentions The Virgin Spring.
Dark_Horst: i had to take care of my baby brother, so i left for a while, and then saw what you replied.
Wrek: that's funny then because I can understand what they're saying, and I don't speak a word of Swedish.

The name of the character played by Gunnel Lindblom is never given and she speaks no lines in the film until the penultimate scene where she has the final line of the group being taken by Death: "It is finished."
D:
DANCE OF DEATh
Looks silly
Quickie Trivia: The last-but-one scene in which Death is dancing away with his followers was shot when some of the actors had gone home for the day, using some technicians and a few tourists as stand-ins.
and then checkovs mural
haha
Swedish Tourists ftw
That's just creepy
dem pants

Wrek are we allowed to stream PS2 even?
Wrek: when the actual game comes out is it still f2p or buy once deal?
Applechip If you want to get in beta though you can buy the alpha squad thing for 40.
Or sign up for it and hope and wait.
05MaxTheBrony yeah the NDA was liften a few weeks ago
Ahh
NDA?
13non disclosure agreement
Yeah Game agreement for Beta testing
13you say nothing about whatever the agreement covers, else you get sued
Exactly
hey Shizuka what do you think of human revolution?
13dxhr is good
So basically no talking about the game
Nee! Discosure shrubary!
Exactly
you cant even tell anyone that you are playing it
:)
So, these airdrops are a new thing to this patch?
or atleast not official
nope
they are and have allways been in
i think
Man they really want to keep this under wraps
Okay
its much money behind this so i guess they need it
Bayonetta 2 Awesome!!! Wii U exclusive F**K
hmmmm
is resident evil 4 worth buying?
Not really
Y is feet drawing so Hard!?
i need more opinions
D:
Bronysith you will play it 2 times at most
I'm gonna get slapped for this but this makes me think of a suped up Halo
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: i take that as a no
/me slaps Spademagnes[School]
that alser there looks kind alike plastic
haha
Well it plays better than Halo for most parts
You should look at these maps
they are massive
Getting shot out of nowhere needs work
is a good game but i just borrow a copy from a friend and finish that not lasted enough to be worth buying
Spademagnes[School]: that'S something that comes with gigantic maps, no mistake of the game
Morning all.
Re4 is fun to play with someon
Ok.. because I hate it when Im doing somethign and then bam I'm face first in the dirt
Heya XAX !
MY ARMS
THEY BURN
Yeah that happends when you dont check you surroundings
Well its hard to see people sniping
/me pokes Bronysith with a stick
MaxTheBrony: Is that you in your steam picture? :o
Yepp :)
:D
the whole katana art, swift strikes, fast movements
fun but extremely demanding
heh
its irretating that you cant shoot while cloaked in this game :)
Man I miss my Hybrusa armor in Halo
Btw have they done anything to halo for a while now? I meant anything gameplay , cause every halo is almost the same.
i miss super mario 64
-throws candu and muffins in the chat
i got an old N64 right here :P
*&candy
How much do N64 games go for?
/me Picks up the muffins and Throws them back at RanbowDash90
I can't wait till cloakers get their shot gun.
heh
THen I might actually use them.
yeah
I have a veritable treasure trove on N64 games
Bronysith: you could just get it for wii or ds
hai all
11,02Dat 64 ping O.O
:)
fuck the wii
Heya RanbowDash90
hi there super
/me glomps NewSuperBronyU
how are thubgs RainbowDash90
05shit!
I still have my Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie cartriges, My paper mario cartridge, My OOT cartridge and Two Majora's Mask cartidges
i have my n64 with majoras mask
at least i still have my fav zelda with n64
Bronysith: well, don't miss it then :P i play my old games on my N64. i even got 3 game boy color right here :P
Were all the MM crarts goldish?
I only have played n64 once :( i feel ashemed
ashamed*
Eli: you dont need 2 emotes
Lol the Emote police is here , ruuuun
Bronysith: i forgot you don't like emotes :P makes me wanna use them more :) ;)
heh
Were all the Majora Mask game cartridges gold colored
Bronysith: i don't usually troll, but here's the thing: How can you NOT like emotes?
kind of confused by the rifle sound. is it surpressed or not?
dont see any surpressors or that
Eli: i dont mind em, it is just when people spam the fuck out of them, and the :P just seems to be a mocking/sarcastic emote
not even a cat
xD
The hell just exploded?
/me hugs Bronysith back :D
I just see The derpy emote as a fun emote :)
But its true it can be seen as sarcastic
depends what is written before tho.
Bronysith: well, it is. it's the : P < "i stick my tongue out to you, because i'm 11 years old" emote. i love it
D:
why NewSuperBronyU ? why bayonetta 2 is wii u exclusive ? D:
I do that all the time Eli
D:
Wrek: can that rifle even damage vehicles?
MaxTheBrony: me too :)
Dark_Horst: to some degree
I decided to not buy a WiiU when it comes out
but its not very effective
11,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Because the Wii U is the greatest gaming hardware ever created. Having an awesome game on it just seemed natural :)
loving the pistol
Wrek y dun you fly some :)?
its epic
11,02Also, it's sticking it to those who doubted Nintendo before o-o
Flying is hard.
I Love flying
NewSuperBronyU: dont hug the cat before it'S dead
MaxTheBrony: i don't wanna grow up any faster than really necessary
It the best flying in game ever Imo
Lets hope Super Mario bros WIIU is more interesting than NSMB2
11,02Dark_Horst: That doesn't make sense.
Im still young so i guess i can use the : P smiley until im 18
New Super Mario Bros 2 was fucking boring
xD
or if theres a age limit to smileys even
Same content as 1 except with shit loads of coins...
11,02Don't jump in the front of a car until it's ready to hit you.
im too tired for UMvC3
Thats not how you do a sequel
NewSuperBronyU: you think? what about guinea pigs?
lets play a relaxing game of FFVIII
MaxTheBrony: you have no idea how old i just felt because of your comment... i'm 19
heh
xD
Spademagnes[School]: i stopped caring about mario a long time ago
11,02Guinea Pigs eat pellets. I play Nintendo games. Just not the same.
I like the fat guy D:
hmmmmm
NewSuperBronyU but i don't want to buy a WiiU just for a game, make them port it to pc D:
Most of the launch games for the WiiU are ports
11,02CONFIRMED
11,02Season 3
lol
OMFG THERES GONNA BE A SEASON 3???
13there is no season 3
I find it confusing the 3DS XL is cheaper than the 3DS at launch
omaigashomaigashomaigash
11,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT: PC sucks though so I would be doing the game an injustice D:
what season 3? MLP?
MaxTheBrony: si seniore
wut? season 3? is that something like G3?
:p pfft old news
What's this pony show everyone keeps talking about?
xD
and then NewSuperBronyU unleashed the console VS pc War
XD
Ponies? but i'm alergic!
Also what was this Ambassidor program the 3ds had?
(yeah, they're a day late with shouting about that Facebook post)
Dont start console war :)
i dont want them to tell me about season 3 I WNAT AN AIRDATE
Dark_Horst december 21 2012
11,02To have a war, the each side has to put up some sort of fight. PC has nothing to stand on. It's for YouTube and Email. Why would I want to play games in my email? YouTube is for videos, you can't play games with that. Just crazy stuff.
there
pc is better in the longrun
Love the Vanu fighter ships!
MaxTheBrony: i should go and dig out my NES, but i don't think many games still work on that thing... wrestling is awesome tho
13don't troll...
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: got that from where?
:D
<.<
Lol'd NewSuperBronyU
NewSuperBronyU: pfffft apparently youve never played Call of Gmail 4
haha NewSuperBronyU :D
becasue "me own arse" does not count as a credible source
NewSuperBronyU i'm quite sure there that you are just trolling so i'm not continuing with this convo
Yes because 360 is so much better...
13bashing PC while supporting the company that's been flogging the same game for over 20 years
twilight_sprinkle: 10/10
13for shame
My KD on Youtube is 20+
13you should be ashamed
Dark_Horst .... you did not got the joke
11,02Okay, fine. You can play FARMVILLE on PCs...
XAX: ikr, i loved it. especially the part where you have to write an email that was awesome
Flogging what game?
NewSuperBronyU: we got farmville 2 Now!!
In 3d!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
MaxTheBrony: Damn, mine's only around 11.
NewSuperBronyU: don't troll?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: seems i didnt
*cough* WoW*cough*
XAX: Im a champion on youtube :)
11,02Eli: Eat cookies? Stay in school? Brush your teeth at night?
NewSuperBronyU: i don't do either...
11,02I brush my teeth with a rag on a stick.
i brush my teeth with a stick.
NewSuperBronyU: i brush my teeth with a cat. The cats have spoken.
Hi bronystate.
rocket launcher is best infantry defense
11,02hai FillyFlam :3
goi FillyFlam
*hoi
Heya FillyFlam
hi FillyFlam
hi
Trying to be sarcastic never works on the internet
xD
Unless you are talking with skype or such programs :)
landing pods. neat
Spademagnes[School]: yeah... i noticed that a lot... i have to stop being sarcastic in RL
Woah lag
I miss Bf 2142 :) but this is a worthy game in that genere
but they kinda go that from BF2142
Was that lag his side or mine?
Dark_Horst: i think Planetside 1 had it first actually
then came Bf 2142
Spademagnes[School]: yours.
2142.
What a game.
Agreed
Spent so much time on that.
It like slowed down when he was going to respawn...weird
Loved pod surfing xD
Ikr :o
and crashing it in a car or mecha
xD
Titan mode was where it was at.
I loved titan mode!!!
God I played Halo so much I keep refering to these vehicles as Not-Mongooses and Not-Wraiths
MaxTheBrony: possible didnt play that one
put a "." behind that possible
I havent played Planetside 1 but its what i think.
I will start using more correct grammar cause i noticed how sloppy my texts are.
did anyone in here play planetside 1?
Night guys :) sadly some have school tomorrow
bye Eli
That sight does not help
that soldier has a stretchy neck
Night Eli !
bye
nighty
bye Eli
planetside 2 just looks so fucking big
it probably is
Just how would a console even run this?
Dark_Horst: Planetside 1 came out 2003 , so i guess they had droppods first.
Spademagnes[School]: No idea
MaxTheBrony: if they HAD droppods
Im quite sure they had. TB talks about it all the time
tb?
about how great the first PS was .
Total Biscuit.
Theres one thing PC games have over Consoles... Memory space for games
YAY KILL EM ALL :D
also the option for way more power thatn cosoles will ever have
yepp
TEAM FOUR STAR MOVIE
A console would not be able to run this with out massive lag and popup
I asume the maps are fucking huge
They are O.o
its amazing
becasue, consoles? they're designed for a fixed price that as much people as possible can afford while balancing that with power
13to see how a console game runs compared to PC, just look at rage
I can just walk arround forever
PCs? the only upward limit they have is "top tier"
13consoles are incapable of using the high resolution textures a PC is, so they had to cause extreme pop-in to make it half work
Rage wasnt that fun ... I buyed it for 25 sek, its like 2 $
You know SOnic 4?
Alot of the music had to be edited because of the Wii's shitty hard drive
13i haven't gotten past the first building after the guy saves you, the pop-in and stuttering is unbearable
Ah, finally I have beaten Deus Ex.
I truly am the greatest.
13id seriously dropped the ball on rage
Shizuka i just came to the town then i gave up
you notice that especially in games that were primarily designed for consoles and then lousily ported to the pc
:p
Buytoast: deus ex 1?
SB64 troll level-100
Yes
there'S always some uglinesss here and there, humping your head
Dark_Horst see dark souls ?
The Wii has a super small hard drive
either graphics, or controlls
Dark_Horst: I know what you mean.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: nope
11,02twilight_sprinkle: I thk dat pc r not kool caue i no liek too ply fram gaem i mean it frm how suppos to kill? wit shuval. NO. u no shuveel it u no kill u has to kno garen. once u garne den u maek plant. i no liek gaem. i play reel gaem. kitchen mama. it fun.
13idtech5 was supposed to be amazing because instead of a small number of high resolution textures it uses a large number of unique low resolution textures
13which gives it the feel that it's quake with more polygons, the quality is that bad
I played dis game
Dark_Horst actually yes dark souls did not fix anything and the pc realese suffers from a lot of problems
NewSuperBronyU: i have no fuckingclue what you just said, but it sounded trolley
Ya dont say
Dont let them land D:
SuperDolan64 wll cnsles get not new, ihve to byu new cnsles for 2 pley nwer gms
Oh look a Not-Pelican
xD
its A GALAXY!!
13you do realize txtspk makes you look like you have severe brain damage right?
not a Not-pelican :p
11,02shiuz y
Well the vehicles look pretty god damn similar to those things
wre nt brndamged, wre dolan
Shizuka and gives brain damage to people reading it
When did first halo come out?
before 2003?
D:
yup
way before 2003
yeah i guessed so.
halo was 2001
considering the 10 year anniversary was last year
heh
true xD
not next year
i just wait the day for phantasy star online 2
i cant get over how stretchy that soldiers neck is
And I'm not comparing this to halo I just played Halo alot so the vehicles look so god damn similar in shape to those halo vehicles
11,02But I have to say, taking into literal account the meaning of my words above don't actually equate into something coherent. It takes a firm grasp of the English language to fully comprehend such a broken and fragmented statement. Read between the lines as it were, good day.
13a cat walking over a keyboard would achieve the same effect, but you don't suggest cats understand english
go fuck a dictionary
Dark_Horst: Or a thesaurus
AND NO LUBE!
NewSuperBronyU: :D
Shizuka: Of course not. Everyone knows cats speak Japanese.
Maru is best cat
2,14 nyan nyan
heh
Heya Caramel !
13gorgeous, delicious, and deculture
hi Caramel whats going on?
Shizuka: :D Macross!
11,02Shizuka: You are underestimating the intellectual capacity of the feline species. Do you not know your place human...err...I mean...do you not understand?
13oh is that where it's from
how are things Caramel
2,14 hello
13dogs have masters, cats have staff
corporal stretchy-neck on duty!
13alternately
13dogs love, cats tolerate
Shizuka: Macross Frontier apparently
2,14 it's so odd how whenever I stop lurking, people think I've just come on :P
some people just dont know the world outside of lightIRC Caramel
Caramel: same :D
they cant tell when you join :p
11,02Oh hello Caramel, welcome to BronyState :)

As I was saying Maru is best cat
11,02frmvil is not god gme
That must of been hard to do.
farmville is not a game
angry birds is not a game
11,02i kikd :<
Farmville is Sweet Apple Acres
twilight_sprinkle: SB kicked Caramel, Caramel kicked SB
11,02i hs sahd :<
i thought CnC4 was a real good game, interesting gameplay design, quite refreshing. also loved how they resolved the story
/me pats NewSuperBronyU "itl b arright"
moo
Whats the opposite of Improvment?
...god i feel dirty now. anyone got something to shoot me with?
Kick waaaar!
11,02Moooo ;~;
Banned gonna banned? :D
13Caramel: just set a delay of three seconds
2,14 no idea how to do that
13depends on the autojoin script
2,14 it's not a script, just an option I have enabled in mIRC
my autojoin such joins automatically upon login
nothing special

that woman robot thing is creepy
Doesnt IGN hate Sonic with a passion?

Anyways , Good night guys see you tomorrow :)
NIght MaxTheBrony :)
I stopped (actually never started) to visit these "Game Journalist" Sites like IGN, Kutaku and godnows what
night MaxTheBrony
bye MaxTheBrony :)
bye MaxTheBrony
Does IGn actually play the games all the way through?
my, there's a lot of fancy starcraft stuff on DA
I get al the news I need off "This Week in Games" with LordKat, "Show and Trailer" by Video Games Awesome and the rest off Blistered Thumps.com
hi...
If I recall they thought Sonic and the Black Knight ended after the King Arthur boss fight
and suddenly i hear tidus
I don't think so, IGN doesn't care about games outside of the FPS genre...screw IGN...
To be honest I hate fake credits
/me hugs CCCP
Hi CCCP :)
hi Lil_B =/
Y'mean like the "Fake Kredits" in DKC1?
/me hugs Lil_B and thelonepony
The kind of credits that play and when they're over the main portion of the game isnt even done
One example?
Sonic and the Black Knight
derp derp derp
:D
I just hate these so called "Journalist" on these sites, who don't have a neutral look at things, get their facts wrong and who appearenlty only write Stuff People want them to write -.-
You beat king arthur and then after the "credits" you still have 4-5 levels and the final boss to do
... I think I forgot my math homework...
Well, in story terms, the Halo series has it's pros and cons.
One major con of the series is when the hell the fight will be "finished".
Halo two's ending was lackluster
i almsot got suspended in school for 10 days today =/
Spademagnes[School]: Halo 2's ending was meant to directly lead into Halo 3
CCCP: what did you do
Halo Reach if anyone bothered to real the story was a prequel
Alriiiiiight guys! I have just thought up all SORTS of crazy items for TF2
It was a forgone conclusion
...
*read
...Who wants to help me make 'em?
Bronysith brang a knife to school... its a little complicated
halo reach was a prequel
*brought
we don't brang things
CCCP: why the fuck would you bring a knife to school
I played Starcraft 2 with a guy that asked me "Hey, does anyone know when the Heart of the Swarm patch is going to be released?"
ask my moron sybling
when he was in school he brought a GUN shaped knife to school
I knew from the begining Reach was going to end badly
Bronysith just erm.. reasons?
Crazy items, eh? Well, roll 'em out Stinkoman.
/me uses the magatama
CCCP: tell me now
When I told him that you would have to buy Heart of the Swarm, he replied "That sucks"
Bronysith rather not
CCCP: oh, lets see
CCCP: a knife is a deadly weapon
a deadly weapon is used to kill
So is Halo 4 a reboot or what?
you had the plan on killiing
-_-
I hope "Planetary Annihilation" will get another 100.00$ in the next 22 hours... for full real life orchestra soundtrack :3
CCCP: thats what i shall assume unless you tell me what happened
Bronysith ugh
Bronysith why would i kill someone in a public building?
CCCP: they must of done something really bad to you, planning on killing someone is very extreme
Isn't it an illegal act to bring a knife in school?
CCCP: TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
okies
So why are they making a Halo 4 when the package for Halo 3 said it was the end to the trilogy?
Not to cause an uproar, but...really man? ...Really?
Spademagnes[School] money
wait a sec
wait
WAAAAAAAAAAAAIT A SECOND
Bayonetta 2 on Wii U?
CrimsonPhoenix WiiU only
Holy shit
CrimsonPhoenix published by Nintendo
So how many WiiU launch games are not fucking ports?
WiiU comfirmed for top consoles
Spademagnes[School]: From what I heard, Halo 4 is meant to the begining of a new trillogy and story.
*be
Spademagnes[School] a lot of them actually
VenHur, like a prequal? :)
Ryunosuke: I'm not a Halo nerd, but I kind it's MIGHT took place after Halo 3...
uh oh
*think
I doubt MC will be in it given he's stranded in fucking space
God, my grammar is not improving today...
oh
that is good
when it said teaser, I was hesitant
but that is actually good
and not s3 related
Hello! did i miss anything?
<.<
Hello Ponyloverforever.
Hi
Spademagnes[School] ithas about 20 or 25 Launch Titles, the only ones who are Ports of already existing games are Ninja Gaiden 3, Batman Arkham City, Trine 2 and Mass Effect nad tecnicly Darksiders II, but I think that is to recetnly to call it a Port
Hi Ponyloverforever :)
like I said in the comment
It looks really good
but it's not show's style
hi Ponyloverforever
Im still not going to buy a WiiU at launch
hia Ponyloverforever
Hai
SpadeMagnes[School] nobody forces you too XD (at least not here)
300 is way too expensive right now
Yeah, I'm waiting until about 2 years after its release to buy it.
Pikmin 3, I DO want for the Wii U (Dem Graphics!), but NSMBU and Nintendo Land and the third party titles...I'm not sure...
I'm still not sure if I want to buy NSMBU, it seems like it's copypasting from the DS game.
In terms of gameplay.
I heard the first dungeon in Zelda WiiU would take at least 2 hours or so
SpadeMagnes[School]: It took me an hour in the first dungeon to realize their was a switch under a broken bridge that I needed to hit. :D
*there*
NSMBU ... meh... I wanna see if they finally did something new other than gorgous backgrounds, but Nintendo Land... while it looks really awful and was presented horribly, kinda looks like a really good game when you look at EVERYTHING it offers
Apperently the dungeons are fucking massive
But the feature to use new stuff in existing games (like the footage from Wii Sports) caught me off-guard...
Nintendo land looks like a good game but it was not a good choice for what to end the conference on
Actually according to recent reports, the Wii U will have approximately 50 titles between November and March. Supposedly. And one of them is Bayonetta 2.
SpadeMagnes[School] they already talked about Zelda on the WiiU?
Still skeptic on whatever to buy it or not...
I really didn't like how NSMB Wii dragged on.
PLus, the co-op inthe game is downright terrible.
Being Dicks the game
Yep.
Plus, trying to 100% the game at the same time does NOT help. :|
And on that note, I'm gonna go ahead and laugh at the people getting mad at Nintendo for resurrecting Bayonetta.
CK|Catnap: IKR? :D
What I wants in a Nintedo press conference: Star Fox 128 (or U) F-Zero ZX (or some other name), etc.
Didnt a Mario game called Mario 128 got scrapped?
ello everypony
For all those people who don't know about the whole Bayonetta debacle, Sega said that they were NOT going to fund Bayonetta 2. Nintendo, however, decided to fund it only if it was exclusive to Wii U.
Sequel gets canned, so Nintendo offers to publish the sequel as a console exclusive, and everyone's like "FUCK YOU NINTENDO". Oh, so you'd rather not have Bayonetta 2 and just let it die? Really? You sound like a really big fan of the game, then.
WildRepublicGuard: Hi:)
Why did sega not fund it?
hia WildRepublicGuard
SpadeMagnes[School]: They didn't feel like it, I guess.
hello AJAwesome, Lil_B: how r u
It's also glorious that Nintendo is getting flak for daring to actually respond to people's complaints about a lack of hardcore titles.
I find it weird most of Nintendo's game are based of parts of Miyamoto's life
I'm enjoying the blatant hypocrisy of it all.
> Gets pissed the sequel gets canned
Having 128 Marios in the game is like Pikmin's 100 pikmins in the game too.
SpadeMagnes[School]: I find it awesome, though. :D
>Bitches more when Nintendo revives it
LOGIC
OHHH HEEEEEECK
hes playing STARCRAFT 2
So basicly, Nintendo pulled a smart move by saying that Super Mario 128 is ACTUALLY Pikmin 1, 2, AND 3.
Problem solved.
Love this game...
Their major complaint is "oh noes, it's on the Wii U and I don't want to use that piece of shit because it doesn't have any hardcore exclusives".
So, ya know, IDIOTS.
Define hard core
You first. I've always hated the term.
ohai everypony :)
So, all in all most people are okay with it, but the loudones don't?
It seems to imply your game is somehow better if it's considered "hardcore", even though there are many good games that I would never think a "hardcore" label fits on.
hi Michael
hi Michael :)
The fuck does Hard core exclusive even mean?
ohai Michael :)
Vivix Its call a vocal minority.
So it seems-
Fun Nintendo Fact here, Nintendo was going to make a sequel to Super Mario 64.
/me hugs thelonepony WildRepublicGuard AJIsAwesome
SpadeMagnes: It's an excuse. :P
ok, I'm gonna make my math homework now, calculating curves >.< , after that I'm gonna go to sleep. So bye everyone :)
11,02VenHur: They made a bunch of them so far :P
i wub hugs :3
And yes, it WAS going to have Luigi in it on the Nintendo 64DD.
Lil_B: Bye :)
SpadeMagnes: It's idiots making excuses to not buy a Nintendo product, because "that's so childish".
bye Lil_B :)
/me hugs thelonepony "Me too \:3/"
GL with the homework Lil_B
Lil_B: bye
love how we are talking about Nintendo as the streamer is playing starcraft 2
Because as we all know, there are absolutely no children on Call of Duty.
NONE.
/me hugs AJIsAwesome thelonepony Michael and WildRepublicGuard ;)
Not a single one.
just immature teenagers
:D
However, the commercial failure of the Nintendo 64DD make it failed to released the game...
How the hell is Call of Duty "popular"
A DWARF!
THAT IS A CYBORG!
SpadeMagnes[School], old school deathmatch and tdm in a fast package
Well you see Spade....TEAM DEATHMATCH.
It's like playing HL1DM again, just with less health
I can get that in halo
05old school?
CK|Catnap no only Men whos only reson one can't see their manly chest hair is because their manly beards ae so damn long!
TEAM DEATH MATCH
05you serious?
SpadeMagnes[School]: kids?
some people don't like halo
wat is Star Craft
Wrek pretty much, it's senseless dm like old dm games
SpadeMagnes[School]: cades to broad masses with simplicitiy.
I got bored of CoD FAST
Lil_B: They're so manly and hairy that they're oft mistaken for dwarven warriors.
oh boy..
her.....
/me has too much blood in his alchohol system.
haha
yay, zergs?
YAY FOR ZERG!
I find Megaman Battle Network fun...but man it can get dull sometimes
cant wait for HotS
the problem is, producing a game that just consists of simple deathmatch, it tends to get some pretty dumb followers. inevetible
I don't like most mp games, but they're fun if you play with people you know with voice
Whoo.
And yeah, Call of Duty and "old school" don't belong in the same sentence unless one is explaining how NOT old school CoD is
indeed Vivix
I think CoD feels old school, fast, unmotivated, tdm and dm
Call of Duty is an old game.
CoD is kinda old school.
Modern Warfare isn't
and then BF3 came. and it had amazing graphics. which isnt a bad thing on its own. but those graphics sucked all the kids out of CoD and made them flock to BF. and then teamplay went down the toilet
obviosly
oh, this mission?
THE TOILET
of course, It's a while since I played old games, but I can go straight from opposing forces tdm to cod without getting jarred
Call of Duty hasn't been old school in a very, very long time.
shit son, firebat country incoming
Call of duty need to die in hell
Old school does not mean "good game"
...
Call of Duty needs a hiatus
It's not old school by any definition.
fixed that for you
I like CoD Zombies.
At all.
It is, in mp terms
Lol your people are gonna die streamer!
the only real difference is powereups and classes, and lower health
MW 1 was nice. after that, they just kept trying too hard
Try playing Goldeneye mp, seems the same
>implying there are differences between CoD titles
At least Halo kept MP interesting
Because they got lazy and reused MW1 for 4 games
CK|Catnap: there are. the perks got more bullshitty with every instance
The again, you can't profit off of World War 2 forever
CoD is just an enjoyable game like Halo and GoW 3.
Wonder how a guy playing strategy will work on this, they are either really good, or have never done a strategy game before
By making games about it
stripporgram?
CK|Catnap: and now they try to promote customisable loadouts as an "amazing new class creator"
God help you if you fight any koreans
Like TF2. Just one of the very good MP games.
So basically they're trying to pretend they have RPG elements?
less talk, more fight
gotta love those little talk snippets
Not really
http://derpy.me/f2FNo
That's adorable
CK|Catnap: now, they take ideas from battlefield and act smart
*no
Barbetos|AtWork: :D
If you are going to critisize a game, you should do it because you've tried it and disliked it. CoD is unpopular because of it's fanbase and the curent "realism" high
It's not unpopular.
Barbetos|AtWork: dat name
But brown is real!
All games should have nothing but brown!
It is CK|Catnap just look at how it's received by "gamers" vs "casual gamers"
It's been a top selling franchise for the last three or four iterations.
whoever said cod was unpopular
So was Twilight, would you call it popular?
Technically? Yes.
well, LIKED by the general crowd is more accurate- rather than popular
Vivix: tried Mw2. same game, other number. from what i saw after that, the other parts werent any different
because both of htose are popular, but not well liked
CoD is popular for the morons
If it's selling, there are obviously enough people who LIKE it that it makes money.
Dark_Horst, I've never tried MW2
Because idiots keep buying it
Again, they got lazy and reused Modern Warfare for the sequels.
not really
CK|Catnap: we call that mindless customer zombies
But the popularity is not.
Because people are stupid and will eat shit up if it has a big shiny 2 on it.
CoD just need to stop it
Sales = popularity. Opinions = reputation.
So? Whatever makes money will be done
Do not confuse the two.
Thanks, yes.
Twilight is popular but it does NOT have a good reputation.
CoD likewise.
True
That's what I meant, sorry
and that'S why more devs need to try crowdfunding. if they get the publishers out of their necks, games will actually be not the same stuff over and over again
but the reputation, is it experience or is it bad because of it's popularity?
I hate the utter shit gets sequels but the stuff that NEEDS sequels dont
Buytoast So, the main Mario games are mainly the same, but those recieved well.
Hi.
Again
People eat shit up if it has a big shiny 2
C8
or in mario's case, "New"
Depends.
never cared much for mario anyway^^
but i still enjoy them
the only mario games i ever had were break fillers on my gameboy
This is an age where sequel is very popular, both in movies and games
Actually Mario keeps selling mostly because it keeps providing a similar, yet unique, experience with each game.
gre out of gameboy 10years ago, so...
And then New Super Mario Bros 2 happened
i know one thing im buying the hell out of borderlands2
So it feels samey enough to be familiar with it, but it changes things significantly more than many other popular titles do.
waiting for fallout 4
Maybe, I never really liked mario
That's sort of how direct sequels work, though.
rumors are it'll be boston this time
yeah
Dark_Horst: want
how dare you not like Platform hopper Simulator
MIT center of Commonwalth
Not my taste Buytoast, I suck too much
I love Mario but I hate NSMB2
In mario, I die ALL the time
I'm actually somewhat fond of the 3D Zeldas.
Its a copy paste of 1 with TONS OF COINS
hey
That must make it worth buying! (sarcasm)
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mab49cexuL1rywedzo1_500.jpg Look what I got today C8
Because while the core is the same, the world and story often aren't exactly the same thing. Except the OoT rereleases. Seriously. Stop that shit.
actually the mario games i had did play quite different
Buytoast My critisism for COD is that they release them too fast. Eventually, it could kill the genre of FPS's. It happened with Guitaer hero.
Well no shit
they keep making lods of emone
awesome :P
i kinda wanna watch dinosaurs, but idk where you get em :P
money is king
Regardless, CoD isn't even a blip on the radar in terms of damaging the market.
They need to put a haitus on that crap
True
No, you want to know who will kill the market?
Only people who enjoy it really play it, most don't care about it
My class went to a used bookstore c:
otherwise even the stupid ones will notice it's alotta the same
Two letters. TWO FUCKING LETTERS.
EA
^
AE?
how does one kill the market?
wow
I think Indie will severly damage gameplay and how games are made, but that after the fire there will be better games and stories
I love how Gaben told off EA
EA? oh yeah, those need to fucking die
must protect valve
That's an excellent question, p4ngya
They tried to buy Steam, Gaben basically said for them to fuck off
SpadeMagnes[School]: what did he do?
oh, okay
Here's my answer in a consolidated and crystallized format:
But they made SSX.:'(
Command and Conquer Generals 2
He didnt actually say it but it was basically the premis
Sweet is thy girth, my Gaben, my king.
Gabe was angry at xbox because of free DLC forced to cost money, and no direct contact with customers and stuff, imagine his rage at EA
i discovered another spyro fangame :P
Would you prefer the long explanation or does that one about sum it up?
lol wat
He said he would rather have Steam disintigrate then be bought out
CK|Catnap: oooh, the one they wanna make free to play?
YES. THAT ONE.
I grit my teeth every time I think about it.
Generals 2?
I saw the ad--with the..lady thing
or FIFA
and I walked away
yeah, imagine my hype when i saw the first screenshot (frostbite IN CNC!) and then fidning out it'll be a free to play model
Ya know how Spoony's big intro to gaming was the Ultima series? Mine was C&C.
well, we all know what free 2 play translates to in the EA dictionairy. pay to win
I'm actually pretty happy my old the little mermaid VHS broke. Cuz I wouldn't have gotten it today... cuz this one... has a PENIS on the case
I played CnC as a kid too, one of my first games I think- the CnC Demo in 199,,3 or something
Tiberium Sun, specifically.
Was the first computer game I played.
Okay
XD
started wit RA2
no one played Dark colony?
*RA1
My intro to gaming was SSX3 and Burnout Revenge.
RA2 was the second cnc i oned. then tiberian sun
burnouts a great game
I think mine was..random amiga and commodore games, and- on pc..CnC, Doom--Duke Nukem 3D
at one point i also had CnC1
So when I hear that my favorite strategy game ever was going to be made into a F2P buy-to-win microtransaction-heavy piece of fucking garbage....I was understandably a little bit angry. :D
i hear ya
loved generals and zero hour
my favourite was Red Alert 1 and 2
refreshing break from the old gameplay while still feeling like CNC
need AOE 4
never reaally played generals
Didnt EA try to copy steam and failed massivly?
Origin
Origin?
The first FPS I ever played was Turok Evolution.
oh, it's live
BF3 and other EA exclusives are Origin Only
yeah
i couldn't help get it because of me3 :(
I played BF3 for like..4 hours, then got bored of it
aww
I was gonna get ME3 but..
i think BF3 on itself is an awesome game
ME2
worthy successor of BF2
I'm back!
if you ignore the bugs
The first FPS I ever played was Turok Evolution. Looking back now I feel ashamed.
Dark_Horst: yeah, it's a good game
Dark_Horst, I think so too, it's just--the players weren't very easy to socialize with, and I got kinda boed after a while
what are your guys thoughts on Borderlands2?
ohai Dark92Enigma
Bought it cause of my friends, will probably enjoy it because of them
But yes, Generals 2 is sadly a strong argument for why EA is killing the market. Pushing everything towards multiplayer at the cost of much or ALL of the single player, this drive towards microtransactions and DRM and other scam works, and the desire to give everything "broader appeal" by destroying what made it unique....
Aww yeah..
how are things Dark92Enigma
I agree with that-
Just imagine if everyone did what EA is doing.
I'm not a big fan of MP, when I buy a game for 50 euro, I want a story, a--feeling
mp don't do that for me
it will be liek the E.T from atari or worse
I'm still hoping they end up getting bought out and torn apart. Maybe someone else can salvage the franchises they ruined.
Vivix: that'S what i'm saying all the time. BF3'S graphics whre it's biggest problem. looked so shiny that all the kids ran to it that previously only played cod or css and never came in contact with the concept of teamplay in their lie
*life
I hate ARMA II elitists.
I wonder if anyone would hold it against me if I planted explosives in EA's headquarters
i swear to got, some of the shit i saw on those maps borders to down syndrome
*god
Dark_Horst, true- but, In cod, I was able to almost make a peace ring in the center of a map, make jokes and talk to the players. In bf3 I was told to shut up, and in RO2 I got kicked for typing something unrelated to tactics
Vivix: Stop having fun guys?
yeah-
2,14 Spade: I would
Bombs...
I like BF3, it's a good game, but I rarely play it because it don't make me feel anything special
that's why i like tribes, seems like everyone's always having fun
Vivix The fanbase for ARMA II is worse.
Vivix: well, it's kind of a sima fter all, meaning that players usually are pretty serious about it. but that seems a bit over the top
Many have recomended that game to me
pyrocatboy,ooohh yees. they're--crazy
Group tactics? What are those? :D
my biggest problem always was that the other players wouldnt say anything at all. tactical understanding like lemmings
hehe yeah
/me loves how people in GW2 haven't been giving him those problems for the most part. ^^
but yeah Arma, I've played that game series since Operation Flashpoint
Oh great my anti virus is being shit again
and the game hasn't really gotten better- the sp campaign in arma and arma 2 is so broken that even the cutscenes crash
It blocked the stream window saying its a Potential Hacking/Computer Crime site
but still, if you critisize it, people rage at you for "not appreciating how crazy realistic it is" while clipping through walls and flying
CK|Catnap: what kind of problems?
the fun thing is that event he devs say arma isn realistic
05thats what i love about planetside
*isnt
05so far everyoen is nice
Vivix I know! Show any interest in a FPS that sacrifices a bit of realism for fun (IE: TF2) they will absolutely FREAK OUT>
sup everypony? what be the haps?
yeah, that's true Dark_Horst but arma3 looks like it will be fun- and playable
Lollery!
yyeaahhh- they get mad
sure, it'S amazingly tactical and hard, but not realistic
ohai Dovah
do you think varka whould be a good name for a dragon?
hi Dovah
How does one miss an episode of MLP? Somehow I don't remember Hearts Warming Eve. O.O
Vivix: i hope so
Michael: I haven't experienced a lot of nasty people in GW2 so far. People are generally friendly, barring a few asshats (every game has them) and it's rather common to help a struggling player out.
God I hate the anit virus blocker
Yeah, arma can be tons and tons of fun in mp, with good people and good gameplay, but it's not realistic-
hi
Err.. hearths.
Vivix Have you downloaded DayZ?
Yes.
I'll bbl
yeah, I've played some DayZ with friends, was fun
Wrek: beta phase. everyone is nicer in the beta phase
I had occasions where I got rushed by a few too many mobs, and some guy came along and saved my ass. :P
CK|Catnap: in my server i found a lot of RP :D
How the fuck did it register this site as a Potential Hacking/Computer crime site?
Wrek: becasue the usual dipshits dont care for betas
cya
bye Applejack2012
computer crime? they do stream movies here...
bye Applejack2012
I PURSUETH THE VAST AND BEAUTIFUL LUNA!
Bye Applejack2012 :)
And I really appreciate that sort of cooperative multiplayer. I don't like competitive multiplayer so much, but co-op? I can do that.
Players being nice and friendly is very important to good mp
coop is tons of fun
MedivalPegono: you might not wanna say vast in her presence, that might end with a black eye
wow those bastards are fast
Vivix To me, people play Arma II for the multiplayer so they can do tactics. (Also the campaighn is buggy as hell)
all the army
Wrek what difficulty you playing on?
sick
pyrocatboy, true, the campaign was unplayable- it did not work at all, but hte campaign for the first game, operation flashpoint, and resistance was amazing
so I was sad that sp didn't work-
i bought arma for dayz
but yeah totally, the mp in Arma can be a lot of fun, despite the bugs and weirdness- if you play rp servers or evo servers-
but by now that too is full of assholes and hackers
especially hackers
EVERYWHERE
ahh- yeah
Dark-Horst: Why?
this game sounds like its gonna be fucking awesome when its done
Vivix Best Game Ever: Dwarf Fortress.
Haven't played that-
MedivalPegono: when i started dayz, it was lots of fun. but give the players the opportunity to be assholes and they will be assholes. meanwhile it's more of a deathmatch than a zombie survival game
everybody shoots on sight
I am a novel guy, a story guy- I'm not a fan of indie games because most of them just have gameplay- and I'd gladly play through a game with old fashioned stupid gameplay if it had amazing story that makes me scream, cry, laugh and smile
Vivix Look up Boatmurdered, it is HILARIOUS.
Dark_Horst, yeah, it's true- I mean- it was fine, but then one guy shot another, and suddenly everyone was afraid of eachother, and the super equipped dudes hunted players instead of zombies
Boatmurdered? on Youtube?
Dark_Horst: What thou did ye mean about your sentence?
Dat trident
Vivix Its not a video. All text.
MedivalPegono: wut?
lol
Dark_Horst: Thou has spoke of something other than me sayingAvast to Luna the beautiful.
*saying Avast
oh. i read vast
Dwarffortress looks like those early nethack games, interesting
I'll read it when I got some time to spare
you know, calling someone vast might be taken thewrong wy
*way
vast can be taken as "fat"
since it means big, or far reaching
Let us feast on the banquet of many foods, thou brave knights!
(I do my role well.)
Oh look, it's this game
Vivix Heres one of the lines, WELCOME TO FUCKING BOATMURDERED! Hope you like miasma!
again
Hehe
Lollery!
(XD)
..what did that guy jsut do?
dat upgrades
flex? or fap?
Vivix Also I've started project 'Fuck The World,' a top secret attempt to funnel magma to the outside. I'll kill those elephants. I'll kill all those fucking elephants.
This is Jimmy!
Hehehe
it's like--a mud?
i liked muggy
... what is that horrid stench?
alexxm Nothing much, but i'm still praying 4 him........he's still on a stable condition
little neurotic robot in fallout NV. obsessed with coffee cups
but yeah I like story heavy things- but - little of that, so I'm happy with most some story games
he and the toaster were my favourite characters
Dark_Horst, that robot was hilarious
Vivix Come on guys, we have a nice settlement, why didn't you stick around? Was it the ashen wasteland? The bloodstained gates? Was it the screams of madmen or the stench of death? We've got awful nice engravings of some fucking cheese here, come the fuck on in!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87E6N7ToCxs <-- New Wreck-It Ralph trailer!
hehe
wat
... * smells fart * WHO HAS DISRUPTED THE CLEAN MERRY AIR?!
2,14 I don't know whether you're roleplaying or quoting pyrocatboy, but cool it
Quoting, I think
quoting what? boatmurderd?
AJIsAwesome: Former WWF/E wrestler, now commentator

Think so
Ooo, new trailer for Wreck It Ralph

05its awesome

Nice.
Marco.
2,14 now time for some nostalgia
Yay! :)
bayonetta 2 only for WiiU :[
indeed
NINTENDOMINATION
Michael: It's better than not being made at all. :S
i dont want to buy a Console only for a game
For all those people who don't know about the whole Bayonetta debacle, Sega said that they were NOT going to fund Bayonetta 2. Nintendo, however, decided to fund it only if it was exclusive to Wii U.
hmm.. looks vintage
What's this? Disney's Atlantis in Space?
wait.... were those bugs=
oh my god. starship troopers
wat
the anime?
Oh man I love this cartoon.
rly?
there's a anime?
more like animated 3d
im not doin my part
...there's an anime?
This looks familiar :)
awwwww yeah
It's CGI, like Beast Wars
Hi everyone!
oh you bet im doing my part, eating a sammich as youre talking
ohai Wirisme
hi Wirisme
hoi Wirisme
How's everyone today?
how are things Wirisme
wuts up wirisme
good Wirisme
dat music...
there was a starship troopers cartoon?
why are there a bunch of wanna-be master chiefs?
whats on now?
what dis?
2,14 you sadden me chat
alexxm: good thanks
This series expanded massively on the lore and universe.
they're called marouders and would eat the masterchief for brakfast
starship troopers
2,14 you sadden me very much
*marauders
2,14 not knowing Roughnecks...
ohai Wirisme :)
There was a Starship Troopers cartoon.
I remember seeing it as a kid.
2,14 that makes me sad...
Caramel: I new it look familiar!
I remember the cartoon Caramel.
But it wasn't my cup of tea, Caramel. :(
RICO!
I remember almost no cartoons-
I didn't even recognize animaniacs
Vivix: :O
I used to love animaniacs :)
which is ironic, cause it was hilarious when I saw it again
So many innuendos they got away with. :D
Haven't watched it in so long
and..am a big western animations fan
the one time "earth to *insert name name*" actually makes sense
dat name name
/me pats AJIsAwesome
It's alright, I was outside a lot
Old cartoons are pretty awesome with content.
My favorite bit was the "prince" bit. That was hilarious. :D
I still can't believe they got away with that. :D
http://derpy.me/2tA-F lol
Oh god yeah
Depends on where they were made. Reboot got away with a lot of stuff because it was made in Canada.
I just remembered it
fingerprints
"I don't think so." :D
That's insane
dat giant lyra
Cartoons still get away with a lot, but- not all
so are they troopers or maruders?
I am eh eh..
cant wuite tell
god so distracted
And Desktop Ponies crashed.
Vivix: Take Regular Show for example.
Yeah!
I love that show-
It's funnny, because I'm using Desktop Ponies right now. :D
*funny*
a lot of cartoons fall in that trap where they eh--present it as a sketch, rather than a show
alright. now i know they're marauders
Pretty damn awesome.
wow
Also look! The exosuits that the movie never showed.
yup
There was a movie?
Now they have mechs.
you are a marauder in the game though
There were several.
including that drop
378 below zero?
oh wait, farenheit
Was the game any good? I never got it to work on my computer.
There was a Starship Troopers game I never got to play.
the shooter or the strategy one?
I remember the strategy one.
Strategy. I didn't know there was shooter.
Hi guys, AJ.
i remember playing the fps, dont remember much though
Kinixys: Hi :)
you should try the shooter. pure fun
Those guns sound so lame in the cartoon.
this music lol
I do remember that.
ohai Kinixys
I can't imagine that a shooter game would be very original though.
I think I've seen this.
hi Michael .
pew pew pew
nyst: it'S not. it's pure unadultered one way elvel nonstop bug smashing fun
hi guys
I don't have any games like that :(
Do the graphics hold up today?

Kinixys: ninja'd again. :P

p4ngya: they eat troopers^^

there fucked
Nah, this is the movie wayyy stretched out over several planets.
this is is not the movie
dat exosuit
^3^/)?
(\
i like turtles
what is this?
Hearth's Warming Eve was great! Adds so much lore.
From what I remember they have non-hostile worker bugs that can dig through rock and grow food inside their body for the others to eat.
Not going to hit it with that pea shooter.
nope.avi
Yay turtles p4ngya .
Kinixys: yep. One of my favorite episode from the show.
we r not outta here
how come Nittany_Discord's name wasn't colored?
Nyst: we actually saw those in the movie. one corpse and some carried the brainbug
dis music...
:'(
plus, you get to smash em in the game
Not using color.
http://derpy.me/uJJeT reference?
:'(
dat music
If you didn't know them you wouldn't recognize them in the movie though.
i
so that scene there made it into the movie?
what was first, the movie or this?
Ricooooooooooooo
The books.
didnt ask for the books
Movie was before this.
Michael: dat last panel derpy :P
The CGI isn't bad at all for a show this old.
i already know it started with books

Hello, random strangers!!
Hi SKLittleDino
best mlp villain is discord...best villain ever is Kefka
YESSS
Bronysith: There is a Discord one :P
Ponies47: there is no kefka one
cause kefka is pure awesome
Best Villian ever is Captain Quark from Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando :/
just saying
/me Has no idea who Bronysith is talking about
CJ Collins is best Kefka
Bye bye everypony
Kefka rises above the average villain simply by the fact that he won.
Bye CCCP
KILL THEM.
whats that sandvich?
kill them all?
GOOD IDEA
ok..
Trixie!
George Soros is a better villain than Kefka... more or less.
Kefka didn't exactly have to do a lot to win
but he's still awesome
he is best villain
why?
CUASE HE FUCKING DESTROYED THE WORLD

hi DocSane
Caramel: really? sorry then
how be you DocSane
I get a black screen with a buffer circle
2,14 you might want to refresh then
It's from 4chan is probably why
Okay, but I should get back to work on the emergency project that dropped into my lap.
it was a picture of jon snow as a power ranger
my thing always gives me that malware bullshit when it comes to there
Well, 4chan isn't malware.

Why is RD freaking Mengsk though...should have been Kerrigan
spoiler she never figured it ouy
so changelings and parasprites are zergs
guess so
hmm
GodponyPart3 trailer next please?
i need to play Starcraft 2 :l
lol well they kinda make sense, changelings look like them, and parasprites multiply super fast
It's getting late here so I'm gonna... put in my headphones
;)
haha
cheesey lines everywhere
heh
ah discord
I like cheesy lines
My little marines friendship is protoss

Aaaaw yeah
Buytoast i like the original one more to be honest
original and best to date version
not the livingtombstone one
NEver heard either of these
Love isn't worth fightinng for. Can you pbelieve there wasa General Makepeace in Vietnam? Geeral Makepeace... head of Equestria armed forces?
the livingtombstone one is crappy
that face
/me prefers livingtombstone version
much work was put into the cover clearly
ohhh, ya ive heard this
lutterwonder
ya i like the living tombstone one
/me preferst both
prefers*
what I love about this one is the accordeon at one point
ok this is fucking awesome
i like both versions as well
is Sumica here? :p
i have a question
those eyes..
about a movie
now the question is did they actually play these intsruments or did they do it digitaly?
Quick_Thinker, most likely digital
cause if either one they still both are hard to do
dat gilda
gilda smiling.... LIES
that doesn't look creepy..
Whatever makes that noise I want it
here
sounds like a wierd al song about to start up
ha
and now its scrillax
of course
man this song jumps
Philomena <3
get burtn pilo
gilda looks werid when shes happy
i think its because her face is meant to be frowning
not smiling
OH YA
all dem originals
love this song
i love this one1

when did we finish the starshiptroopers
Time for BLOONS!
so many remixes
gotta say, i love that emo fluttershy look
Those are a lot of links
AVGN?
Oh yes
Angry Video Game nerd :D
i dont know why but this song always reminds me of bloons tower defence 5
emo fluttershy <3
I just had yellow cornbread with yellow mac and cheese with yellow apple juice and then I went pee
emoshy is the best pony
Quick_Thinker: What?
thnx Caramel, kinda hard to see with those
well not best, but awesome
She doesn't look emo to me, just serious.
The pee was purple
/me kidnaps twilight_sprinkle
Hello every pony! :)
she looks more goth than emo
alexxm: where are you taking me D:
I'd like to see a pirate with this cast
how are things Klumzeedragon
Lunac: Like Pip? :P
whats the matter twilight_sprinkle
alexxm: Things are well. :) How are you man?
alexxm: im scare ;_;
twilight_sparkle shame on your lack of studies :|
*scared
Lunac: sprinkle* :P
i'm good Klumzeedragon
soz
Pinkie pies are slightly off kilter..
why are you scared twilight_sprinkle
one is above the other
LYRA
Lunac: press tab when typing a name for it to autocomplete
alexxm: well you kidnapped me...
Im like behind everyone apparently..
so twilight_sprinkle it's fun
?
wut :I
what the buck
all right
what the hell...
who spiked the muffins?
alexxm: lets hope its fun for me too o_o
wat
WTF?
...What?
/me chants with it FOR THE #%# OF IT
/me pets twilight_sprinkle
/me purrs
This is titled "HAwaiian War Chant", although it's neither a warchant nor Hawaiian.
Even without ponies it borders on mindscrew territory
sounds like in the jungle the mighty jungle
/me doesnt know whether to be scared or sing along
scare
least the singing
d
goddamn calculus midterm, my brains feel like jelly
Hi bronies/ponies! :) long time no seeN!
SCARED SING ALONG GO
ello Pikachu
hoi Pikachu
hi Pikachu
Heck-- you should see the old AMV version with Jinnai and the Bugroms from El Hazard.
how are things Pikachu
lol RD is like da fuq??!
nummmununshv hot sauce a p opap ap pap
/me throws a pokeball at Pikachu
*Throws a pokeball at Pikachu *
...
/me throws a MASTER ball at Pikachu
nothing that REALLY HURT
habbb hot sut zut zut maka tic num momomomo
fuck this
ah num
Lunac we seem to have ninjaed each other
*shoots VenHur and takes his masterball*
That didn;t hurt? Fine then I beat Pikachu with a 2 by 4. ;D
THE MASTER BALL CAN FAIL
i have interesting story on why it can
whag
what*
Lies
this isnt quite the bizzare video or anything...
Masterball is for Mewtwo only.
Lotto emails finally got sent out a while ago.
Only fails if you try and steal another players pokemon. :D
but you cant even send out the ball
should do my little ponybots Caramel
i was fighting mewtwo in Pokemon Yeloow and i ran out of pokeballs and had ONe left so i threw a master ball AND I SHIT YOU NOT IT FAILED
he broke out
Klumzeedragon: With cheats that can haooen
Oh. I like this one.
TREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
are we doing requests btw?
It failed...?
2,14 the way they designed the pokeball mechanics, theres a .001 percent chance of it failing
:)
really
2,14 true story, look it up
lol sucks for you Quick_Thinker
New meme dected: TROLL BALL
Quick_Thinker: Bad luck on your part. :D
so i got the most lucky ever XD
*dectected
Caramel, are you good with movies? I have a question for the lotto :)
are these requests?
If pokeballs were real they would fall out the sky XD
2,14 what do you mean "good with movies"?
so .001 could i even recreate that in a 100 years
lalalal
Caramel: are we doing requests?
2,14 no
dang..
ok
Pikachu: I know. :D But I never cheated on the pokemans.
Pikachu: Um...there was a commercial about that...
Caramel: I'm guessing he wants help in chosing what movie to vote on in the lotto
Pikachu: That was to promote Diamond and Pearl Versions...
VenHur: this one?
why is Pikachu talking?
would pokeballs work on humans
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwSD9F_LEmk
i thought pokemon dont speak
with the basic system being 0000 0001 (binary it can go up to 164 so that would mean there are over 1000000000000 possible outcomes) and most being the same
2,14 no non-image links
Pikachu: No vids
Pikachu: holy fucking hit
Because hes tired of saying his own name
why does the tower knight/ penetrater music laugh at me?
bad Pikachu bad
/me hits head
man thats the most luck i'll ever have in my life AND IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN
EVER
is that tf2 looney tunes?
Whut?
theres stream? i dont see it!
http://derpy.me/CkuDz
man im hungry
Pikachu: Yeah, there is. :D
im going to go eat
9 x 6 = 42 make it work
cya Quick_Thinker
you know pokeballs could probably really help out in a non pokemon fight
Quick_Thinker: Eat well. :)
bye Quick_Thinker
hold up
Bronysith: Oh my god...YES!
bai Quick_Thinker
why would they make the road runner demo man and not scout?
oh hey it is valthejeans
bye Quick_Thinker
Dovah what you mean by 9 * 6 =42
NewSuperBronyU:
wtf is this?
that 0000 0001 thing i did is basic binary
meaning the coding that tells your computer EVERYTIHNG
Quick_Thinker: it does using something about base 13
DarkStratos: He's doing something with Desktop Ponies looks like
VenHur: surprisingly?
hmmm whats he doing
hes a hunter
OF COURSE HE FITS THE ROLE
I recommend I, Princess Celestia by Woody
or she
so for instance i want to make a 10 in binary it would be 0001 0000
a one in binary is 0000 0001
a 2 is 0000 0010
Marven is good doctor. :P
ha
there is only a 1 and a 0. 1 being ON and 0 being OFF
woudlnt that make it 5 not 10
somepony on stream has genderbent main six desktop ponies
no it wouldnt
binary works like this
Someone should make mods and character voices based on the picture, who agreed?
/me goes copy paste the binary code
AGH NO DONT TEACH ME BINARY, I came from school to this to ENJOY
22nd
VenHur: Meh. I prefer the pony mods. :D
Wait a sec...I looks at the picture again...Daffy's eyes are derped!
/me wonders what Caramel is doing
TOO BAD YOUR GONNA LEARN
>:L
NOOOOES
2,14 darn, guess that doesn't work
Don't scare the new guy away Quick_Thinker
oh no i have to type an essy and its do tomarow.... well keybord looks like we got are selves into a mess again
Trying to science, Caramel?
fine
Everybody may I have your attention?
i'll leave it at this
2,14 was gonna have the mane 6 go up against their R63 versions in hoofball
lol ya only joined bronystate yesterday >_>
Pi is exactly 3!
2,14 but it doesn't seem to like using the second monitor
woah wut...I made an emoticon wiiith >_>
yay!
Dovah: audible gasp!
2,14 oh well
Dovah: My attention. You have it!
2,14 hope you enjoyed the stream
and 9*6 really does = 42
always Caramel
tnx Caramel
Thanks Caramel :)
Thank you, Caramel.
Thanks Caramel
Indeed Caramel
Dovah: how?
thanks for the stream Caramel :)
binary is a an 8 digit system that ONLY has 1 and 0 in it. with one telling the computer to make it ON and zero telling the computer to have a system OFF. also just typing this is a around 500 codes in binary every letter is determined by a number A being 0000 0001
Thanks you, Caramel.
and there you go my quick cut down lesson on binary
Have a muffin? Or even better, a TACO!
lol..
thanks for the stream Caramel
twilight_sprinkle: i'm not an uber math wiz so i couldnt explain it if my life depended on it :P look it up
thanks Carmel for stream
Quick_Thinker: why is it 8 digits
so b would be 0000 0010? Quick_Thinker ?
its the max it can do
yes
yay!
Quick_Thinker: what *it*
anyone know how to break 128-bit encription?
until you get to C which is 0000 0011
hello everypony
why couldnt it be 0000 0100?
Hi Freefall29.
hi Freefall29
sorry A is 01011
no stream?
ello Freefall29
nope
Stream just ended, Freefall29.
hi Freefall29
/me glomps Freefall29
ok then..
Dark binary is a system set in place by the first makers of computers i cant really explain everything
thanks Bronysith
I will now give the joy of demon's souls to the chat!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjotdhdBLM
Heh looks like you're interested in the binary lesson after all DarkStratos
so how was everyponys day today?
also there is always a 0
yes the music is laughing at you
Random Chat crash..
black mesa comes out tomorrow.... soooo awesome.
Indeed
atleast up to the xen chapter.
quite alot atleast
so for instance you want you number to be 0 you put in the number (which you will have to learn this sooner or later in math) 0000 0000
I'm new to TF2 PC
Can someone play wiht me?
now with more numbers comes more results
To practice, learn the basics.
ya to practice do training
someone tell me this doesnt sound like that episode of doctor who in the school http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGo5UWO_HLA&feature=channel&list=UL
then offline
http://i.imgur.com/UeOrK.jpg
1 in binary is 0000 0001
thats a man hug
2 is 0000 0011
sorry thats 3
so we talking about biniary code?
2 is 0000 0010
yep
wait so does the 2nd 1 count for 2?
like 1=2 2+1=3?
im borrrrrreedddd and my C++ is updating so yeah
Quick_Thinker: is this all over a failed masterball?
Quick_Thinker: 0000 0100 is 4 right?
yep dovah yes is it is
No I did training, I did all of them got that achievement Up for Duty
you are corrrect sprinkle
/me faceground
I mean If I can team up with others?
In a game.
could coach ya
however that works lol
ok
steam name?
MASF123
figures
same with me
MASF123: you should get this map for training http://gamebanana.com/maps/107794
I know the name is shicking
shocking
once you get to 5 things heat up its now 0000 0101
Quick_Thinker: so how does this connect to the masterball thing? i got in chat only after that
O_o
twilight_sprinkle: welcome to bronystate
that map actually does help much, or atleast to me Freefall29
im trying to figure out the base number the master ball had to land on to fail
All of this binary talk reminds me of this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc8s3LPehWM
with each int being a 1 or 0 and binary going up to 164 it can get crazy
Freefall29: ive been here for months, i just meant i missed the part where he explained the masterball part :P
twilight_sprinkle: sorry... I was being sarcastic. but yeah, I agree with you.
Quick_Thinker: odd they didnt just program it to always catch
MASF123: well addin ya
well sprinkle i didnt think of this but heres the thing YOU ACTUALY cant do that
Freefall29: i actually like scence talk
well people im off for some TF2 cya all!
there must always be a fail
MASF123: what class do you play as atm
bye DarkStratos
bye darkstratos
so one of those numbers had to be a 0
bye DarkStratos
no stream
Bye DarkStratos.
bai DarkStratos
and any of them could have been a 0
Bye DarkStratos.
lol wait 5 seconds for all the byes
bye Dark sorry i bored you with math
so i feel happy
|See ya later DarkStratos
DarkStratos: have fun
naw problem Quick_Thinker
Quick_Thinker: but why couldnt it be programmed the same as 2+2=4 for example, that always happenes, so why not make the same happen in-game
to be honest im new to binary myself i've only learned the numbers up to 40
Quick_Thinker: or can 2+2 also fail
you cant have 2 in binary
at least not the code
Quick_Thinker: i dont mean binary
its always 1's and 0's
Quick_Thinker: i mean the way they programmed 2+2 to always be 4, why cant they program a masterball to always work
well there is a small possiblity for 2 +2 to fail allthough the only time it did that was when i was doing basic coding in C++
Quick_Thinker: lol well thats lame
im not going into any detals for C++ cause it requires a pretty good grasp of math
i will say this much he is a baisc code in C++
Quick_Thinker: maybe its just because they used the same formula as http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/2/20/Catch_formula_1.png for the masterball?
Hey everypony
/me sets DerpyMuffins on fire
hi
how are things DerpyMuffins
/me kidnaps DerpyMuffins
Quick_Thinker: its 100% catch rate only if the pokemons hp 1/3, but thats impossible since hp is an integer
Hi DerpyMuffins. :)
#include (isostream)
{
Quick_Thinker: isnt it ios?
cout << "what is your name?" endl;
PBearHasSwag 18 minutes agotheres﻿ not even 161,175,345 people in the world
Quick_Thinker: i think its iostream
actual youtube comment
cin >> "my name is.";
wtf
Hey guys is there a stream going on now or no?
system ("pause") ;
and there you go
/me dances a jig
that just told my computer to pull up the command prompt and ask me my name
Quick_Thinker: also you forgot the int main ()
im able to give an input to that and from there it ends
shush
Quick_Thinker: NOOOOB
im new to C++ and coding all togehter give me a break
Quick_Thinker: jk, i just started recently too :D
Quick_Thinker: whats the system ("pause") for
i've been watching tutorials on mine
dat Caramel oc in the stream
to tell the system to stop asking the question ELSE IT'll GO ON FOREVER
system makes a system call; on windows, "pause" is a system call you can use to make the command prompt wait until you hit a key
AND EVER
Quick_Thinker: i do return(0)
also that
RANDOM VIDEO
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0
i just do the pause way
Penis
Quick_Thinker: me thinks return (0) is better since it actually ends it instead of pausing, altho i dont really know the difference
the reason for adding a pause is usually your program will run to the end, and the command window will poof

/me murders Bronysith
is a random video Bronysith Gungam style is predictable
man i've only been using basic int and other shit like that. The reason why is im planning on making a video game and ITS GOING TO TAKE MONTHS UPON MONTHS OF getting ANGRY at C++ to get even understanding the coding
twilight_sprinkle: that doesnt work on me
Bronysith: youre dead.
let alone MAKE A GAME
twilight_sprinkle: nope
i have the utmost respect for programers now
Quick_Thinker: itll take you years to get to that level im thinking
THEY GO THROUGHT TONS OS SHIT
I've tried to understand programming. really. but its just too hard for me, all this logic.
making games and programming games can be two different things
twilight_sprinkle: and you just jelly cuz you cant dance like that
to that level yes
Bronysith: Bronysith: fine, ill murder gangnam in stead
ok I'm back
Bronysith: and its easy to dance like that
how are things MASF123
Going to try that beta map.
twilight_sprinkle: vid for proof then
yeah NullRadix im new to C++ so im not really one to be saying those things
alexxm ok I guess
Quick_Thinker: i think c++ graphics is somewhat different
actually im new to coding and programing all together
one day Bronysith , one day.
started YESTERDAY
twilight_sprinkle: at least the video is amusing and not stupid like bieber
it helps to already know binary though
at least basic
okay now IM REALLY HUNGRY so bye
Quick_Thinker: ive only begun c++ a few weeks ago. before that i only did stuff was in turbo pascal. although i did program quite a bit in mathlab
quite a bit, get it? teehee
Bronysith: but it Is stupid
twilight_sprinkle: no it isnt
twilight_sprinkle: once again, you just jelly cuz you cant dance like that
Bronysith: it is. the musics sucks, the dancing is easy and....well thats it really, nothing else to it
Bronysith: which vid you talking about?
shitnam style
Freefall29: Gangnam style
why do i have so little food in my house :(
Dovah: cause i ate it
/me gives Dovah bison meat
twilight_sprinkle: Asshole!
Dovah: :<
yay thanks Bronysith :)
twilight_sprinkle: its actually a somewhat clever bit of social satire, particularly when you add in the variant version with the standard k-pop star singing the refrain
/me beats twilight_sprinkle with a blue whale
/me eats blue whale
/me eats Ness
Unnr: its not That clever. i know amatuer pop parodies a billion times better. plus the worst thing is that its popular because its catchy, not because its good
/me blue whale eats AJIsAwesome
/me makes Bronysith spit out Ness
/me eats the whale as Dovah beats him with it
twilight_sprinkle: now you know how i feel about skyrim
So much RP today. :D
fucking hypocrite
/me ends rp
twilight_sprinkle: What do you know about the south korean music industry?
Bronysith: skyrim is actually good though.
twilight_sprinkle: uh oh
twilight_sprinkle: and just like that you are a hypocrite
Bronysith: how is he a hypocrite for liking skyrim?
Bronysith: i believe you that it might not be as previous elder scrolls since i never played them, but its still a good game. plus i hate gangam being popular because itll induce more music of the same sort
Freefall29: he doesnt like something everyone else likes, he likes something everyone else likes
Bronysith: why do you say skyrim is bad? what is your resoning? if you are comparign it to dark souls then you need to die.
/me kidnaps twilight_sprinkle
Dovah: im not comparing it to dark souls cause that is very unfair
Unnr: well i have seen a few songs, but it doesnt seem That clever. plus like i said, its actually getting popular around the world because its catchy, not because good satire
Dovah: he mostly hates it because he thinks it doesnt deserve all the popular and praise it gets compared to games he likes, such as morrowind.
*smacks alexxm* "No." :|
like comparing a porterhouse steak(dark souls) to a piece of stale bread (skyrim)
alexxm: but..but...i never left D:
hey AJIsAwesome what was that for
Freefall29: how about i answer questions addressed to me you prick :)
Bronysith: thank you I hate when people do that "dark souls is better than skyrim for the sole fact you can play with 1-3 other people in a closly definde world"
alexxm: *kidnapping is not good.* :|
so how did i do that twilight_sprinkle
Freefall29: answer for me again and i will suck you soul out through your dick :)
alexxm: i.dont.know. o.o
/me kidnaps AJIsAwesome
Bronysith: wait. you be doing the sucking?
Freefall29: vaccuum
Bronysith: sooo youll suck his dick?
twilight_sprinkle: yup,
you heard it here first, folks
but he will die
*stuffs decoy AJIsAwesome into alexxm's bag*
most mind blowing 30 seconds of his life
and his last
back
huh i didn't know you could do that AJIsAwesome
Bronysith: I dunoo bronysith, I havn't got my HIV results back yet.
do what?>
Freefall29: implying you have sex
alexxm: I always keep decoys of me everywhere, in case of a decoy emergency.
Bronysith: so really whaay do you dislikje skyrim? is it the graphics the gameplay, the story?
Dovah: yes
WOAH
what?
what did did i miss?
stupid disconnect
wall of text
wall
of
*nods*
kool-aid man. take down that wall
txt
Dovah: skyrim doesnt deserve the love it gets, so overhyped and overrated
link wall?
OH YEAH
Nope, k-pop rant
from me
Unnr: was it dorected at me?:D
Hi bronystate.
Unnr: because my chat crashed XDDD
hello fillyflam
hi FillyFlam
Hi, FillyFlam. :)
hello
Yarrp.
But *shrugs*
hi FillyFlam
Hi FillyFlam :)
how is everyone
how are things FillyFlam
sup God_the_Atheist
im good God
oh no
Unnr: just press up and reenter
oh shi
le troll has entered building
alexxm: Good, thanks. :)
Bronysith: ..... skyrim has the best grafics of its time the game play is very smooth (could be better tho) and the story is decent yest is slightly over hyped but why hate the game? i am almost willing to bet you have never actually sat down and gave it a legitimate try
nananananananananananananananana
Dovah: ...
Using a standalone client specifically set to not re-enter text when up arrow is pressed.
what r we watching
/me gives Dovah flame shield.
Dovah: what kind of person would i be if i gave a game a review without playing it ?
Circles of buffering
. . .
the magical power of buffering
Dovah: i logged 50 hours in that PoS
/me likes to watch the moving circle chase its own tail
Dovah: it is so boring
Bronysith: you'd be surprised how many people do that
Dovah: implying i am a sheep false gamer
Also, Haku is here
I play games for my own personal enjoyment
okay so apparently most peoplle learning program by after a 6 months they should Be masters at it
Dovah: you're saying we should play the game before bashing it? I got too much pride to play black ops 2.
i dont care for other peoples opinions
Bronysith: so you like action rpg's better?
once i got a pack of shapies,i then used those sharpies all over my keyboard, now my fingers are colorful
Freefall29: only exeption
Dovah: never said that
Dovah: i like good games, not overhyped pieces of crap
And whats a good game then?
good games are good
Dovah: plus Dark souls was a complete game from
launch
and not have planned DLC
Bronysith: no it wasnt
Tell Haku, what makes a game good?
Bronysith: Prepare to Die, nuff said
night guys
[SWAG]Haku: personal enjoyment
night alexxm
Dovah: thats what it is called for the PC dumbass
bye alexxm
night alexxm, don't be kiddnapping no more, ya hear
ok Freefall29
[SWAG]Haku: what makes a game good is on personal enjoyment, not what other people say
night alexxm :)
Bronysith: I think you should cut him a little slack man
i dont find skyrim to be good
night alexxm
Bronysith: "since launch" it came out nearly a year ago and they are planning a dlc to add prepare to die to counsol
Ded?
Freefall29: your soul is looking mighty tasty
Dovah: planning, not PLANNED
Bronysith exactly, so leave the man alone, please. He likes a game, or he dislikes it (Im not really keeping up with you two) but I do know that whats good isnt really up to debate
Bronysith: Well technically it is planned now
He guy, check this promo for another Brony documentary done by Paleo:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BBhaU19tKg&feature=player_embedded
there is a releast date
Dovah: skyrim had PLANNED dlc since launch to suck money from your wallet
Ded.
Yeah, welcome to the real world
almost all games and movies are made to make you empty your wallet
Bronysith: skyrim is hundreds of times bigger than dark souls and is still getting bigger
And somehow the link gets messed up
thats the point
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BBhaU19tKg&feature=player_embedded
RANDOM VIDEO
look. maybe skyrim did plan dlc. least it didn't pull a mass effect 3 and cut content for dlc
http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&list=LL5QyBGi4t1uDa0FwakXNeYQ&v=1eZQjtbRgn8&feature=fvwp
If MH3U doesn't make it in the US I'll be pissed
Dovah: just because something is big doesnt mean it is good
To be completely honest I think these days basically every game has planned DLC.
like
at all
/me doesnt really know what DLC means, but also doest care
yes, it can be big AND good
but not all the time
very rarely infact
the suckiest thing about learning to program is that i have only my self to learn and the internet no class to TEACH me its all on my own. I've looked all around my state for a month and could not find ONE ,so i just DECIDED FUCK IT I'LL LEARN HOW TO PROGAM ON MY OWN
its been a pretty nice start so far though
Quick_Thinker: you're mad arent you?
no
So is anything even streaming?
[SWAG]Haku: nop
damn
still dont think you really TRUELY gave skyrim a try, did you just meander around the woods for 50 hours? did you bother with all the funny easter eggs and intentional/unintentional glitches?
<.<
>.>
Quick_Thinker: there are colleges to learn programming....
ambicious (that is sooooo not spelled right im sure of it)
Freefall IM NOT A COLLAGE STUDENT IM 16
Dovah: dont tell me i didnt give it a try
in other words IM ON MY OWN
Dovah: DONT YOU EVER TELL ME THAT, I GAVE THAT GAME 3 TRIES
AJIsAwesome: Kitty style fu.
EACH TIME BORES THE FUCK OUT OF ME
Kinixys: IKR? :D
Bronysith: .... correct me if i'm wrong but i think i just did.
Bronysith and Dovah.... you're fighting like a married couple... either STFU.... or STFU
^
/me steals Freefall29 s soul
<.<

/me gangnam styles
Freefall29: We could just leave them at it, eventually they'll probably start making out.
Freefall29: I dont care if he doesnt like skyrim I just want to know his reason why.
So, about that local sports team (sudden topic change)
im feeling like absoluting murdering someone
Quick_Thinker: I have it.
Is there a stream?
great my steam is
/me oppo gangnam style

Dovah: dude. just.... he hates skyrim with a burning passion. just leave it at that.
Quick Thinker

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyK2o0wr9x4&feature=plcp
Dovah: how about cause the graphics suck, the combat is terrible and the story is god awful and has the worst fanbase this side of sonic the hedgehog

FillyFlam: if i hate anything its being called gay.
/me gangnam styles with [SWAG]Haku

Quick_Thinker: But my desktop is 500 miles away. Can't play it. :C

[SWAG]Haku: heeey~sexy lady!
Dovah: what is to you, real reasons
god im bored
Dovah: Not gay. Just a little Foe Yay.
/me puts on sunglasses
/me gives [SWAG]Haku sunglasses
C++ drains me of all my excitement to be a game dev
To me, its not being cvalled that bad, its being called gay for idiototic people
/me Bronysith already had sunglasses
Dovah: how is that not a real reason? the gameplay is bad
Freefall29: skyrim graphics suck? i really dont think that is possible unless you are saying real life grafics suck
i want to make awesome games but im going to have to start SMALL like making my first game walking or opening a door
feels so degrading
Have some YTP. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlIttRmS0Yc&feature=relmfu
Bronysith: could be better very true but its not That bad
stream?
Dovah: anything i say is not going to be a "real" reason to you, i didnt find it fun and the game is just terrible to me. ME OKAY?! or am i not allowed to have my own opinion? am i supposed to follow everyone else like sheep?
DoctoDoctorWho: NO!
No stream
are there even any mods?
fuck it im going to make C++ ask me my favorite pony
Dovah: you dont have to like gangnam style AND I DONT HAVE TO LIKE STUPID ASS SKYRIM
thank you for the YTP AJIsAwesome

Dark92Enigma: \)
/me gangnam styles on everyones head
/me realises Bronysith is ignorante in his opnion and decides to leave him to his delusions
[SWAG]Haku: so many cloans
Freefall29: /)
You know, techincally, Gangnam Stylle isnt a dance, its a a fasion
hello everypony...been awhile.
Dovah: disagree with me, call me ignorant, just like a stupid republican
brony_swan: hi there
Hi, brony_swan :)
:'(
Yo other person
Okay first off, thats creepy. I am listening to OGS RIGHT NOW! Second off, Dovah, who'dja piss off now?
/me hate repubicans and govrnment in general
Bronysith: what do you mean by gangnam styles? new haircut?
Bronysith: republican... really. friggin really
Dovah but do you hate... democrats?
Thanks for the link AJIsAwesome.
Freefall29: "you dont agree with me, you are a communist" thats what a republican is
It's getting chilly in here
Kinixys: No prob.
DoctoDoctorWho: Bronysith is hating on skyrim for no truly good reasons
thats what politics is in general
I'm going to watch Brony Breakdown, I'll be back everypony. :)
I'm a free wing, i'm not influenced by politics
Dovah: the gameplay sucks, and the grpahics are bad, no immersion, game breaking bugs
WTF
Bronysith: BLASPHMER!
Bronysith: well liberals aint so great either. disagree anyway or you're racist/intolerant/ignorant.
Dark92Enigma Gangnam Style is a music video by Psy. Its KPop.
Its very good
I don't hate them, but i don't follow them either
Bronysith: Does real life have bad graphics too?
/me gangnam styles on Dovah s head
Ima vote this year, cua I turn 18 this october
/me lols
Dovah: implying skyrim has real life graphics
Well thats it for me tonight. Bye everypony.
Dovah: also, the graphics dont make the game,
Tata Obsidian.
if you disagree with this
you are a false gamer
^
bye Obsidian
Oooh
And you know what
[SWAG]Haku Oh OK......gonna listen to it
I JUST BOUGHT THAT GAME
DO IT
/me cracks knuckles
/me dances about
man your name was hard
Bronysith: then dont judge skyrim by its graphics which i assume you were doing
to write*
I think it's time I entered the fray, as it were.
/me decides to do the NUma NUma now
Bronysith: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL1lfSzgcAw. this video also applies to everypony.
By the way, newsletter is open for you guys?
Dovah: im not, the game is just overhyped, too fucking easy even on the hardest setting, the gameplay is shoddy and the only reason everyone loves it is because ERMAGHERD DRAGONS
GoI does teams, right? Airship crews?
There should be a Team Bronystate.
Dovah: dont call me ignorant, i played it and beat it and gave it a few other chances
Dragons that also fight the trolls if you get them togetehr
skyrim immersion is no heavy rain but its not that bad and honestly I didnt give a crap about the dragons, i was in it for the lore
Dovah: plus it makes you sound so fucking retarded
Dovah: WHAT LORE?!
Bronysith: woah. dude. no need to attack him like that
Wait, are they still at it?
I thought they were doen with this
Did anypony got into the lottery? My newsletter is still closed
[SWAG]Haku: yeah.
Bronysith: what lore WHAT LORE!!! my god
problem solved
Bronysith: Graphics are a huge part in deciding wether a game is good or not, while a game CAN have bad graphics but still be awesome(tf2 Im looking at you), Graphics are really important.
...
[SWAG]Haku: i thought were wer done to but apperently not
-_____________-
EVERYONE IS INTITLES TO THEIR OWN OPINION. GET OVER IT. HE LIKES THE GAME, THE OTHER DOESNT. SO FUCKING WHAT?!
Buffer show still on?
[SWAG]Haku: thank you,
DoctoDoctorWho: graphics are not that important
/me is embarassed because he accidently put caps lock on
Bronysith and Dovah.... you're both acting like immature children. I really hope you both feel silly.
just enough to make it playable
Freefall29: nope not at all
Freefall29: implying immature children get married
[SWAG]Haku: Don't worry, i usually do that in case of a bad movie
Bronysith: well in some countries they do.
[SWAG]Haku: its okay, i just ignored the dumbass anyways
yeah Freefall29 Bronysith is right, that is just plain wrong...
Speaking of bad movies, whats up with this weeks B movie?
Dovah: what are you talking about
[SWAG]Haku: He can have his own opinion, Its when he starts going past "I dont like it" and starts openly hating that things become serious business
who doesnt listen to anyones opinions and if you disagree then you are ignorant or communist or something
/me gangnam styles all over chat
^
Capn_Gavn: compare it to gears 3, It's not "bad" but its nowhere close to good.

HECK TO THE YES got C++ to ask me my favorite pony
cachi01|phone: Bronysith and Dovah are in a flame war over skyrim
Skyrim player vs hater war goin on rite now
Scoot-Scootaloo: me and Bronysith are arguing about why skyrim is absolutly horrific and every way (bronysith) and why it really isnt all that bad (me)
Freefall29 /)_=
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mabgblSCnd1ru5991o2_1280.jpg
Freefall29: im done now, i ignored him anyways
Skyrim is good. PERIOD
man maybe with enough time i can learn how to make a website on C++
he wont listen to anyones opinions
Bronysith: you're a hypocrite dude
/me is glad to have shared over 20 betas
CrimsonPhoenix: I found "butt trumpet" far funnier than it had any right to be.
c++ is a java script right
X
?
I believe c++ and Java are completely different
Freefall29: i only muted him so that way he keeps complaining and being butthurt and then i dont get banned
only around 5 people i know bought the game anyway :p
C++, I'm told, is similar, but they aren't the same.
Bronysith: You muted Dovah?
They are similiar in how they work. Syntax is different.
hahahahahaha! he thinks I'm upset!!! oh god thats priceless!! someone realy that message to him!
isn't c++ more cleaer than Java though?
DoctoDoctorWho: only way for no more arguing
DoctoDoctorWho: yeah. that was really hypocritical of Bronysith
it has just made my day
(Dovah) hahahahahaha! he thinks I'm upset!!! oh god thats priceless!! someone realy that message to him!
Wii U launch titles and prices released.
Freefall29: why is that? cause i dont want to be screamed at and keep being called ignorant?
thanks cachi01|phone :)
300 isn't bad for a next-gen console, let's be honest.
Better than the PS3's 599 US DOLLARS.
Now Frefall vs Bronysith?
Bronysith: ok... you say you don't like people going after you for opinions... yet you had a flame war with Dovah, attacked him several times calling him a dumbass, when all he ask was for examples why you hated skyrim. you were attacking him.
And from the lineup...I think Assassin's Creed 3 is going to be the Wii U's killer launch title, unless the ME3 special edition comes with a revised ending or something.
.......
00,03Alright alright, it seems as though we have a it of a predicament.
And Black Ops 2. All the FPS nuts are going to go after that one.
Freefall29: i told him exactly what my problems were for skyrim
Bad time is kinda bad
oooh dis gun be good!
hellllooooooo
Freefall29: and he said they were not "real" reasons
You know what guys

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1zbGFGQTq0 is the other cool thing I found.
Second times the charm
Luck DerpyMuffins
True enough, though they've got a nice edge over everyone else.
Derpy_Hooves: what kind of fanfic is it?
Good luck DerpyMuffins. :)
I'm disappointed there's no Zelda for launch, though.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y01nr0DcrKI&feature=relmfu
same thing happend with the wii
I was freaking out this morning when I found it :P
they go first
Wrong Derpy Freefall29
I'm probably not going to bother getting one until either a Zelda or a Smash Bros comes out.
microsoft and sony copy and make it better
doh
DerpyMuffins: I kind of accepted that EQD will not accept mine for obvious reasons
>Better
>Kinect/Move
DerpyMuffins: is it a dirty fanfic?
/me laughs
mine? no no no
flutter_spin: EQD are just a bunch of assholes anyways
who said i'm talking about move and kinect ?
http://derpy.me/xQUiq
Bronysith: why?
i'm talking about the console itself
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zqlVJNsI4o&feature=related
First they changed the rules. They don't accept brony stories.
They didn't make it better; they were doing their own thing.
They had completely different strategies.
13so on a serious note
6^^
There is no link between any of the three consoles.
Freefall29 Here http://www.fimfiction.net/story/50037/The-heart-wants-what-the-heart-wants.
So I changed it. Then I found out they don't like my obvious "Mary Sue" notion
flutter_spin: its their own fault they posted cupcakes on the site.
you do see i'm not refering to move controllers ?
Yeah
00,03Shizuka is a Pyro.
13china has patrol boats near islands they've disputed with japan since WWII
i'm talking about the console
00,03That is all.
never stop worriing about the thing i cant CONTROOOOOOOOLLLLLLL
no one cares about kinect/move
flutter_spin: they dont do fics anymore?
But the objective of the other two consoles was not "make a better Wii"
13the boats are ignoring japanese coast guard orders to GTFO
It was "make a powerful and popular next-gen console
"
twilight_sprinkle1: "brony" fics.. as in "I was teleported into Equestria"
twilight_sprinkle1: they do... its just very, restricted after the cupcakes incident
13we are under treaty that if japan is attacked, the US retaliates with them
The Wii had a completely different objective.
ogod
sorry but everything those console had was a copy and upgrade from the wii
Personally I see there being a great divide between the Wii and its "competitors"
13so yeah
us vs china?
13that's happening
Copy?
Bronysith: why didn't they accept your fanfic?
flutter_spin: why not?
No.
yes
Here. Have some WOAH OH OH HA AH AH AAAA HA AH AH HA AH http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AqHtBLUjgo&feature=youtube_gdata_player
They were developed roughly at the same time.
13and the best part
tell me why not
13the treaty china is citing that says the islands should be theirs
13the US wrote it
At the same time the Wii was being developed, they were also being developed.
twilight_sprinkle1: they stated that a huge majority of brony-fics are bad. Therefore, they just outright chunked them.
oh wow
Copy? Of course not. The three consoles are as different as can be, in multiple aspects.
Bronysith: why did they reject your fanfic again?
00,03I guess you can say the chinese landed themselves on hot water!
Someone mentioned Anthology, I think. They said they are keeping the ones before the rule
00,03YEAHHHH!
Ba dum tss
Scoot-Scootaloo: Booooo........
13more like we have a problem
like what ?
Besides, M$/Sony would never DEIGN to copy a Nintendo thing.
^
13like for serious
you think ?
hey guys :$ sigh Dark Souls dumb archers lol
flutter_spin: well, if it was, then theres no point i ndoing it. they still do a ton of toher awesome stuff
Scoot-Scootaloo I can type ur name
13if china's gearing up to try and take back some islands from japan
Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
Shizuka, we've already had problems. This is just another problem.
Lol hi Sketch
so does Bronysith still ignoring me? simple yes or no question i mean no harm
That was a sarcastic statement, because of Kinect/Move, but console-wise they weren't.
On the technical side, there's processing.
i hope i wasnt right about russia and china attacking the world :I
6Think I just found your account too xD
Dovah: I think he unmuted you.
PS3's processing is completely different; eight goddamn cores that nobody knows how to use.
00,03You are so MLG CCCP
you seriously think they din't copy anything in those consoles ?
I think they had similar strategies in certain places.
also its funny how dari actually mentioned that theres always a war a few years after a brit wins a grand slam
Nah i think he is using hax
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvIFIdQEy0A&feature=channel&list=UL
6Yeah :P
However, I do not believe anything was a direct copy save for the aforementioned retarded motion controls.
twilight_sprinkle1: but like "Rainbow Dash Presents: Captain Hook the Biker Gorilla" -- I too scream "I just want to be loved"
Why is CCCP MMLG?
haha
Their very aims were different.
again i'm not refering to motion controles
Okay, what ARE you referring to then?
Getting on EQD was sort of this "I'm officially cool"
Well in that case, thank you Bronysith, our 'conversation' was very stimulating.
Now, I could care less. EQD reputation is nothing what I first thought it was.
Diabetes bubblegum and muffins
:D
flutter_spin: youre the guy who made those daibow dash presents videos?O.o
let see Wii was basicly > wi-fi > miis> store
Still better than Fedex
does EQD tend to overhype the stuff it posts?
twilight_sprinkle1: what? no. I just said I agree with him.
