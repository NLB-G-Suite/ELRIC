The alternate reality thing is his glasses, a type of HUD.
wtf does triptocane do?
showering, you're doing it wrong
Him getting the shakes is because he's an addict.
Some people just want to see the world burn
2,14 it's just a made up drug
His nose is bleeding.
and the EYES

2,14 and he's going through withdrawal from it
suddenly crime boss
That's some pretty tough withdrawal.
00,10is that like fuckitdol?
Eh
I say plot
The other possibility is that the glasses are his other addiction, and when not using one, he's using the other.

No idea.
Because villians are people too just have a lust for murder is all they can't help it.
It's like an urge.
lol
...I think people should get 2nd chances,
Even if a murderer.
Punishment yeah, but still...

Well there goes Norman.
Atleast Shaun and ethan are alive.
You killed him !
yup
fuuuuuu
let him die
DIE
yeah
33%
That picture
2,14 normally, if madison isn't alive, they shoot Ethan when he leaves the building
well that was ameusing
He can still kill people?
Maybe it's because he had the kid with him.
He got grinded.
2,14 no, it didn't matter before
2,14 which made it even more depressing
Norman died a hero....and a virgin.
I dunno then. Guess it's just fussy.
They only shoot him if he goes alone, right?
That would have been really really depressing.
Or if Madison fails to get into the building?
d'aww...
2,14 probably
awwww
Pft.
2,14 with only one redeeming qualith

Ethan is still foreveralone

Nords are probably the easiest thing to kill in Skyrim
well not necassarily kill
just defeat
darn i want skyrim
badly
like at all
yes i do
Dat jumping :D
:3
and "ERMGHAERD DRAGONS"
psssh
dragons have been implemented in games before
but Everyone creamed their pants when they saw dragons in skyrim
I was more interested in the trailer music.
nyah
it is just the morrowind theme
With a Nordic choir.
it is bullshit
It spawned a meme that everyone except idiot kids hates
wow
00,02i fixed the trap
then i have dumb friends then
00,02well i'm trying to get somewhere
you are just some unfortunate person in there
instead of "chosen one, not slay a dragon"
that is the entire bullshit "story" for skyrim
...
Heck I even have some games which are just completely story :/
chrono trigger, FF7, ff6 ff10 had great stories
about 200 hours
the games were great
skyrim is just side quests
"Today's gaming market" ...
That feeling when you look at society today...
games today cater to casuals
00,02what is this i dont even
http://cheezburger.com/6580532992
Avast me harty
00,02i'm stuck
Kinda adds another layer to "The more things change, the more they stay the same"
that is my fav hunting grounds
00,02ah
cheezburger and 4chin steal all le 9gag memes
why do they do this
just saying
:< blasphemy!
Guys.
http://appft.com
right.
He WAS a jedi.
Canon or no
he just starred in a shit film
RX Sweetie-bot.
Oh.
I see.
Judgey judgemental pants
i get the feeling that games are just going downhill from now on
Not necessarily.
catering to casuals
thats goign downhill
nyah
Judgey judgementalness
i still need to play earthbound
ill play it after school today
Try all the combinatations!~
:P
Woohoo
00,02XD
myah
i need to play earthbound
Yeah!
Working PS emulator?
._.
00,02and then i died
but not at the same time
Playstation?
ePSXe.
because then it would be too overhyped like FF7 which is still good
XAXphone Yeah, it's just a pain to get it working right
00,02which is aparently not very hard at all
Crashed? Haha :D
There's no automaticness like there is with cartridge emulators
Pretty much suck at all games :<
00,02FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
00,02speedrun time
do it.
quarter arcades
Ugh, Time.
Why u no give me time to get ready for school.
i dont like the arcades nowadays
:o
wut
O.o

Lol
^ me too :/
Somehow, my friend freaked out when he saw my Desktop Ponies.exe on my desktop.
mfw. ._.
plus a chest
00,02Prick, also it was hidden
00,02and thus i could not see it
:D
Logic :D
I had a friend over a while back that had just come back from Australia for a few weeks. He came over and saw my wallpapers, and didn't mention it once.
AFTER he saw it, we went through the list and got some ponies.:D
All the not caring.
05so i reworked my desktop today
Bye!
Oh? :o
Skyrim mountain surfing to epic music :D
05lemme screenshot it
00,02Prick, but thats boring, theres dragons to find
I always look everywhere in games. :$
i just burn everything
Most of the time i find nothing tho.... haha
grrr, i need chrono trigger
Derpy!~
I put one wallpaper on a computer no really uses and everyone freaks out. -_-
ARROW TO THE KEEN

What's a "payphone"?
03 Heya
11,02TheDamShadow01: Wii U Media event
ok
11,02November 18th :D
lol
03 xD
11,02Like a month before Japan :3
00,02wii uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Wii U Wii U Wii U~
11,02As soon as this ends, I'm going to wait outside my GameStop :3
00,02he's got a 'not bad' face on
>.>
11,02Till Launch :I
wii u wii u wii u..... nooooo thats not my tipe D:
11,02Basic Set
00,02HIGH SPEED CABLE
11,02Deluxe set it is :3
lol
00,02oh neat, dont need to rebuy controllers
Which ones don't work?
Wild Wiimote appeared
trollers XD
Third-party controllers maybe?
11,02$299 for BASIC
00,02its controlled in software
hm
11,02$349 for DELUXE
00,02good pricing
00,02less than the wii was at launch iirc
11,02Wii launched at $249
11,02GAMES :D
pretty sure the Wii was NINJA'D
00,02oh yeah, that happened before AUD to USD was about 1:1
professionalism at a gaming event?
00,02Tovler, no wai
And I still don't own one
Notendo?
00,02found it on a junk heap
Heh!
00,02read: side of the road
lol
00,02dat massive cable
i wanna buy wii u but.............. no money :'(
00,02i hope thats a demonstration thing
Anyone , does this pose look retarded? http://maxtheswed.deviantart.com/art/Riven-WIP2-326934616?ga_submit=10%3A1347545150 if you dont care , dont click this :)
gona see if a get money at Nov 18
00,02its like multiplayer except no one can complain about peaking
This gamepad thing is probably the most interesting gimmick Nintendo's come up with yet.
00,02Gold_Demona, i think its less 'most interesting' and more 'most usefull'
They still haven't given a price on the Gamepad alone.
00,02$170 iirc
Why would the gamepad be alone?
00,02Gold_Demona, i think you can attach two
11,02I say it'll cost $100 in the US
o.o
00,02which is good, that was a suprisingly good engine
11,02Wii U comes out in Europe on Novemeber 30th!
08,01dooo doo doooooo
pikmin lol

o u x3
11,02Wow
I hope you can change those icons, cause I would turn the football into a controller.
Oooh!
boring
I'm liking the football features
11,02Nintendo is infringing on the copyright of the Vii
11,02SUE EM
00,02i like how they pop the ii in
00,02like its a joke
They're nice and comfy
00,02those chairs dont look comfy, and i know chairs
lol
11,02As soon as this is over, I'm going to try and preorder this system at GameStop :I
ffffff… I'll get one next spring.
11,02Also, yes, I would watch My Little Pony on the Wii U :3
00,02i'll get one when my wii stops being funn
HUZZAH~
yeah
11,02Wii is still fun...which is why the Wii U includes backwards compatibility :)
This is actually a good selling point for me.
Ponies on wii u? :O
Might just be worth it xD
00,02SuperBrony64, backward compatible to gamecube as well?
00,02probably not
lol
11,02Phase4: No :<
03 only wii
00,02inb4 people hack it in
just wii
11,02As long as the system plays Netflix, I'm good on TV content :)
Me too
yep me too
11,02But that tune in option on TV is pretty awesome
00,02homebrew channel on the wii is prety nice
11,02Phase4: It's already confirmed to have Netflix
00,02SuperBrony64, i ment the upscaling
00,02and to a lesser extent gamecube compatability, which would be possible for someone clever to do with relitive ease
hmm, Rango can be picked for A movie
I REALLY like the sports option.
00,02hopefully
yep
lol
lol

I'm mildly pleased at seeing Sandlot

05nope
05wont hang on
I swear you could.
Halo Reach had the best custimisation
LOL
> On this site.
...
i don't really like halo but i admit the forge mode was fun
Logic
i hate swat
The fun of forge mode was really nerfed in Reach
Swat was amazing in H3
Nerfed?
It was improved loads.
No in rech dude
and i hate team snipers also
The place had a fucking huge map
Tsk tsk.
Hate team snipers?
GTFO
Yeah its stupid
I got every skull in halo 3.. ALL OF IT GONE
I get randomly headshots out of no where
05Moopy: becasue aim-assist
The only reason why I kept playing Reach was the assassinations.
05basicalyl built in aimbot
You could turn off aim-assist I think.
Well i get really mad about it
I prefer with out help when aiming.
Meh, firefight is alright.
I wanted one where you fight the flood.
heyo guys
or the Sentinals.
Infection.
All my babies.
Ifection can get chaotic

05hmm

05Eli: no its jsut my desktop
Whats the name of that facility map with multiple bridges in reach?\
I forgot the name
...
o_o
Um...
I know which one you're talking about.
Has a grav lift in the middle of the map, bottom floor?
Yea thats the one
05how long untill 1pm PT?
argh
goddammit Hulu sucks now
FUCK YOU HULU
I still think the sandbox skull is the hardest one to get
/me escapes
It was, only because of the guardians.
but a simple map overload done the trick.
fine
I read the skull can disapear when it overloads
05fun-fact: the "skulL" has been with bungie since the introduction of KTMWTB multiplayer mode since marathon
05again
Oh yea.. sword base can be fun on infection
i still prefer Boneyard with Invasion.

Y'mean like the "Fake Kredits" in DKC1?
One example?
derp derp derp
:D
... I think I forgot my math homework...
Well, in story terms, the Halo series has it's pros and cons.
Halo Reach if anyone bothered to real the story was a prequel
Alriiiiiight guys! I have just thought up all SORTS of crazy items for TF2
It was a forgone conclusion
...
*read
halo reach was a prequel
*brought
we don't brang things
ask my moron sybling
I knew from the begining Reach was going to end badly
/me uses the magatama
When I told him that you would have to buy Heart of the Swarm, he replied "That sucks"
a deadly weapon is used to kill
you had the plan on killiing
-_-
okies
Not to cause an uproar, but...really man? ...Really?
wait a sec
wait
WAAAAAAAAAAAAIT A SECOND
Bayonetta 2 on Wii U?
WiiU comfirmed for top consoles
*be
uh oh
*think
oh
that is good
when it said teaser, I was hesitant
but that is actually good
and not s3 related
<.<
Hi
like I said in the comment
It looks really good
but it's not show's style
Hai
300 is way too expensive right now
Yeah, I'm waiting until about 2 years after its release to buy it.
In terms of gameplay.
*there*
Apperently the dungeons are fucking massive
Still skeptic on whatever to buy it or not...
I really didn't like how NSMB Wii dragged on.
Yep.
Runaway guys and freelance astronauts proved that IN SPADES
ello everypony
Why did sega not fund it?
I'm enjoying the blatant hypocrisy of it all.
LOGIC
OHHH HEEEEEECK
hes playing STARCRAFT 2
Problem solved.
You first. I've always hated the term.
SpadeMagnes: It's an excuse. :P
Because as we all know, there are absolutely no children on Call of Duty.
NONE.
Not a single one.
just immature teenagers
:D
A DWARF!
THAT IS A CYBORG!
Well you see Spade....TEAM DEATHMATCH.
It's like playing HL1DM again, just with less health
I can get that in halo
05old school?
some people don't like halo
wat is Star Craft
oh boy..
her.....
/me has too much blood in his alchohol system.
haha
cant wait for HotS
Whoo.
And yeah, Call of Duty and "old school" don't belong in the same sentence unless one is explaining how NOT old school CoD is
CoD is kinda old school.
Modern Warfare isn't
and then BF3 came. and it had amazing graphics. which isnt a bad thing on its own. but those graphics sucked all the kids out of CoD and made them flock to BF. and then teamplay went down the toilet
obviosly
oh, this mission?
THE TOILET
of course, It's a while since I played old games, but I can go straight from opposing forces tdm to cod without getting jarred
Call of Duty hasn't been old school in a very, very long time.
shit son, firebat country incoming
Old school does not mean "good game"
...
Call of Duty needs a hiatus
It's not old school by any definition.
fixed that for you
I like CoD Zombies.
At all.
the only real difference is powereups and classes, and lower health
MW 1 was nice. after that, they just kept trying too hard
>implying there are differences between CoD titles
Because they got lazy and reused MW1 for 4 games
By making games about it
stripporgram?
less talk, more fight
Not really
http://derpy.me/f2FNo
That's adorable
*no
It's not unpopular.
But brown is real!
All games should have nothing but brown!
It's been a top selling franchise for the last three or four iterations.
whoever said cod was unpopular
Technically? Yes.
because both of htose are popular, but not well liked
CoD is popular for the morons
Because idiots keep buying it
Again, they got lazy and reused Modern Warfare for the sequels.
Now the....ahem...."value" of those people's opinions is subject to debate
not really
But the popularity is not.
CoD just need to stop it
Sales = popularity. Opinions = reputation.
Do not confuse the two.
Thanks, yes.
Twilight is popular but it does NOT have a good reputation.
CoD likewise.
but the reputation, is it experience or is it bad because of it's popularity?
Hi.
Again
C8
or in mario's case, "New"
Depends.
but i still enjoy them
This is an age where sequel is very popular, both in movies and games
That's sort of how direct sequels work, though.
yeah
how dare you not like Platform hopper Simulator
MIT center of Commonwalth
I'm actually somewhat fond of the 3D Zeldas.
Its a copy paste of 1 with TONS OF COINS
hey
That must make it worth buying! (sarcasm)
Well no shit
they keep making lods of emone
awesome :P
i kinda wanna watch dinosaurs, but idk where you get em :P
Regardless, CoD isn't even a blip on the radar in terms of damaging the market.
They need to put a haitus on that crap
Two letters. TWO FUCKING LETTERS.
^
AE?
how does one kill the market?
wow
must protect valve
oh, okay
Here's my answer in a consolidated and crystallized format:
But they made SSX.:'(
He didnt actually say it but it was basically the premis
i discovered another spyro fangame :P
Would you prefer the long explanation or does that one about sum it up?
lol wat
YES. THAT ONE.
I grit my teeth every time I think about it.
Generals 2?
I saw the ad--with the..lady thing
or FIFA
and I walked away
I played CnC as a kid too, one of my first games I think- the CnC Demo in 199,,3 or something
Okay
XD
*RA1
RA2 was the second cnc i oned. then tiberian sun
I think mine was..random amiga and commodore games, and- on pc..CnC, Doom--Duke Nukem 3D
at one point i also had CnC1
i hear ya
loved generals and zero hour
refreshing break from the old gameplay while still feeling like CNC
need AOE 4
never reaally played generals
Origin
Origin?
The first FPS I ever played was Turok Evolution.
oh, it's live
yeah
i couldn't help get it because of me3 :(
aww
I was gonna get ME3 but..
ME2
worthy successor of BF2
I'm back!
if you ignore the bugs
The first FPS I ever played was Turok Evolution. Looking back now I feel ashamed.
Aww yeah..
I agree with that-
I'm still hoping they end up getting bought out and torn apart. Maybe someone else can salvage the franchises they ruined.
*life
i swear to got, some of the shit i saw on those maps borders to down syndrome
*god
yeah-
2,14 Spade: I would
Bombs...
that's why i like tribes, seems like everyone's always having fun

Old cartoons are pretty awesome with content.
My favorite bit was the "prince" bit. That was hilarious. :D
I still can't believe they got away with that. :D

oh hey it is valthejeans
wtf is this?
that 0000 0001 thing i did is basic binary
hmmm whats he doing
OF COURSE HE FITS THE ROLE
or she
a one in binary is 0000 0001
a 2 is 0000 0010
ha
there is only a 1 and a 0. 1 being ON and 0 being OFF
woudlnt that make it 5 not 10
no it wouldnt
binary works like this
/me goes copy paste the binary code
AGH NO DONT TEACH ME BINARY, I came from school to this to ENJOY
22nd
>:L
NOOOOES
2,14 darn, guess that doesn't work
oh no i have to type an essy and its do tomarow.... well keybord looks like we got are selves into a mess again

lol..
thanks Carmel for stream

anyone know how to break 128-bit encription?
hello everypony
why couldnt it be 0000 0100?
sorry A is 01011
no stream?
ok then..
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjotdhdBLM
also there is always a 0
yes the music is laughing at you
atleast up to the xen chapter.

Can someone play wiht me?
now with more numbers comes more results
To practice, learn the basics.

1 in binary is 0000 0001
thats a man hug
2 is 0000 0011
sorry thats 3
2 is 0000 0010
yep
like 1=2 2+1=3?
No I did training, I did all of them got that achievement Up for Duty
you are corrrect sprinkle
/me faceground
I mean If I can team up with others?
could coach ya
however that works lol
ok
figures
same with me
I know the name is shicking
shocking
once you get to 5 things heat up its now 0000 0101
O_o
All of this binary talk reminds me of this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc8s3LPehWM
with each int being a 1 or 0 and binary going up to 164 it can get crazy
well sprinkle i didnt think of this but heres the thing YOU ACTUALY cant do that
there must always be a fail
no stream
and any of them could have been a 0
lol wait 5 seconds for all the byes
you cant have 2 in binary
at least not the code
its always 1's and 0's

I've tried to understand programming. really. but its just too hard for me, all this logic.
making games and programming games can be two different things

/me is glad to have shared over 20 betas
c++ is a java script right
?
I believe c++ and Java are completely different
C++, I'm told, is similar, but they aren't the same.
They are similiar in how they work. Syntax is different.
isn't c++ more cleaer than Java though?
it has just made my day
Wii U launch titles and prices released.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y01nr0DcrKI&feature=relmfu
same thing happend with the wii
they go first
doh
>Better
>Kinect/Move
/me laughs
mine? no no no
http://derpy.me/xQUiq
i'm talking about the console itself
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zqlVJNsI4o&feature=related
They had completely different strategies.
6^^
There is no link between any of the three consoles.
you do see i'm not refering to move controllers ?
Yeah
00,03Shizuka is a Pyro.
13china has patrol boats near islands they've disputed with japan since WWII
i'm talking about the console
00,03That is all.
never stop worriing about the thing i cant CONTROOOOOOOOLLLLLLL
no one cares about kinect/move
13the boats are ignoring japanese coast guard orders to GTFO
"
13we are under treaty that if japan is attacked, the US retaliates with them
The Wii had a completely different objective.
ogod
sorry but everything those console had was a copy and upgrade from the wii
Personally I see there being a great divide between the Wii and its "competitors"
13so yeah
13that's happening
Copy?
No.
yes
They were developed roughly at the same time.
13and the best part
tell me why not
13the treaty china is citing that says the islands should be theirs
13the US wrote it
At the same time the Wii was being developed, they were also being developed.
oh wow
Copy? Of course not. The three consoles are as different as can be, in multiple aspects.
00,03I guess you can say the chinese landed themselves on hot water!
Someone mentioned Anthology, I think. They said they are keeping the ones before the rule
00,03YEAHHHH!
13more like we have a problem
^
you think ?
13if china's gearing up to try and take back some islands from japan
That was a sarcastic statement, because of Kinect/Move, but console-wise they weren't.
On the technical side, there's processing.
i hope i wasnt right about russia and china attacking the world :I
you seriously think they din't copy anything in those consoles ?
I think they had similar strategies in certain places.
On deviantart?
Nah i think he is using hax
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvIFIdQEy0A&feature=channel&list=UL
6Yeah :P
haha
Their very aims were different.
again i'm not refering to motion controles
Getting on EQD was sort of this "I'm officially cool"
:D
let see Wii was basicly > wi-fi > miis> store
