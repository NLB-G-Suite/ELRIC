Out of curiosity, do Terminators obey the Three Laws? I think not, given they kill people.
13probably due to character limits, when you create a neighborhood it becomes, say, "Shizuka's Hood", and people with longer names would run off the screen
technically if you shoot under the leg, its not attempted murder XD

Here's a plan.

My client keeps being weird
she is weak
pull da fawking trigga!
watch her run out of ammo
Even when I re-install
EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!
I always knew km to stand for kilometer
What's it doing?
It sits there checking for updates and generally doing nothing.
If I close it it wigs out.
Man is not a force of good
Read, weak.
yo dawg, I heard you like boobies: http://www.freakingnews.com/pictures/11000/Blue-footed-Booby--11494.jpg
0,14And then she realizes she was becoming the thing she hated.
Man is not a force of Evil
Man is man

The thing is, this director's cut makes Terminator 3 impossible

Here's a good idea Dyson! INSTALL THE THREE LAWS DAMMIT
00,10it's ok they added a ventlation system
3 billion means most of humanity survived
^
skynet is inefficient
it means over half survived XD
XD
America didn't though
only to be killed by robots
11,013 billion was over 1/2 the population back then.

There are ponies all over my screen
yes, now. You just said you were gonna quit tomorrow!
all these deleted scenes really take away from the chase of the t-1000
11,01Too bad they didn't leave the universe open.
Seriously. This is the future of mankind. Level the building
And then they found out that they didn't change the future. They just created a split timeline.
11,01Or this story open.
yep time loop. skynet created itself by sending the first terminator
Basically, the future causes the past to create it.
11,01I actually liked the uncertain future.
