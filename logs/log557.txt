so if Biff goes back in time to make himself rich... then he would never go back in time inthe first place... so he would never get that book
and here we have the "Time is like streams" effect
If they both remain conscious, they meet each other and start talking to each other, and past Jennifer learns ALL about the future. THAT is what ruins the timeline.
GarrettBron: you mean ripples?
Braeburn's studied abroad

where back in the saddle agian.
This movie is based on the alternate timelines therory
00,10pay no mind to smashed car.

operatorpony: If Marty's shenanigans in the first movie caused himself to never exist, then he couldn't have gone back to have said shenanigans.

Anyone that remembers the first movie pretty well, look at all the next scenes, the continuity between the two martys doing their thing at once between the two movies is amazing
00,10any thing realy
GarrettBrony, but Ponies aren't invented until the Eighties
Is there a way to have both the OC in the corner and the Mane 6 shadows at the same time, or would that be too much screen obstruction?

Fun Fact: Tom Wilson, the actor who played Biff, is now a standup comedian. Part of his act includes a song about the frequently-asked questions he gets about the movies. Sadly, he has decided to stop signing anything related to BTTF.

Hello again everyone
Being visited by a man from the future, or simply seeing patterns of history. Regardless, knowing that BAD stuff is happening. And everyone else thinks you're crazy and everything's going to be JUST FINE
It seems like something you'd wanna use, I just am surprised I can't recall anyone using one.

11,01Remake T2 with the T-1000 being the good guy.
The Governator.
That shotgun looks Sawed off though

Run kid run
I think it's supposed to be sawed off
00,10ma dirt bike goes waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Fou_Lou: I still say covering a nuke in skin would have saved them the time.
Right up until the T-800 said "Get Down" we were led to believe that he was trying to kill John, and the creepy cop was trying to protect him.
BWAAAAAAAAAAAAA

otakon: Metal Arm Blades, your arguement is invalid
no blood on the floor?
In terminator three, the whole metal liquid robot proved too expensive, and so they just decided to put a whole bunch of guns inside a skin suit and sent it on its way.
It's like Manhunt 2 all over again!
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, yes. Her name is Sarah
:3 good
0,14now I feel bad about uninstalling it ;n;
you can dual weild tonfa!!
RAWRity seems legit
You should.
You're an evil pony.
I see it's good, so I sasy to my friend "Hey look, 600 kb/s! Yay!" Invariably at that point my connection drops to a matter o bytes per second.

I hope bats eat your face.
0,14it looked interesting, but I still doubt my netbook could've run it very well
11,01Starting to pour rain outside.
Meanwhile, that's a cruel and unusual punishment. Even if he did uninstall Uru.
RAWRity: That's my problem with ALL the terminator movies, just send back a ******** bomb wrappen in skin or something... or at least a DNA-bases tracker...
RAWRity: it had a liquid metal coating, though
(Sorry, if I don't lash out at people every so often I get antsy)
0,14it did okay, but there was one area where it lagged like hell
Manhunt Two, a game not for the week skilled
Shizuka: so i just follow the pastebin link you sent me and that is how we get to the bronystate hood?
"Katch"
13most of the way
Or weak stomached
Right in the kneecap.
Pistol whipped
Terminato Salvation decided to settle for just a green screen image of a robot.
13i'll have to meet you in the city to let you in, or else someone else in the hood already
well he kinda deserve that
lol
So is this the movie where Sarah Connor gains all of her levels in badass?
13basically anyone part of the hood can bring in anyone else, so long as that person deleted their book and all
Woah.
But the arm is a very important bone!
Wheres the choppa?

What.
lol
get to da choppa!
00,10she is gonna unclog his colen

Sumica: good for him
Ponies in the hood.
What are you gonna do? - Clean your sink drain
13well mostly, "hood" is the technical term now
Lool
well.... at least with that it will clean up his plumming
not ded
he didn't kill him
MY KNEES
no one breaks a pinkie promis
00,10corection, he shot you twice
Shoot 'em in the knee
open
LOL
lol
He'll live
MY LEG!
Out of curiosity, do Terminators obey the Three Laws? I think not, given they kill people.
so this is just a free version of myst?
13probably due to character limits, when you create a neighborhood it becomes, say, "Shizuka's Hood", and people with longer names would run off the screen
technically if you shoot under the leg, its not attempted murder XD
13ja free~
So I wouldn't put it past him to lie.
Bullet to the Knee
00,10inb4 guard bleeds out
conveniently the same caliber
hmmm
Hell no, they don't follow the three laws
I use to be a cop.... until I took a bullet to the knee
i remember playing myst like
It's OK he was already a gaurd
what's inb4 mean?
/me megusta face
/me slaps Darf14
I used to a Terminator like you, until I took two bullets in the knees
13uru complete chronicles on steam ($10) is the same stuff in singleplayer mode, and a couple puzzles are made a bit easier to compensate
Sumica: inb4?
X_X
Darf14 you beat me to the pun
Reikim: Given the name itself is a violation of the first law, I really doubt it
inb4 means In before
Reikim: they where created by a machine. not humans so there arent the 3 laws
when i was like 4
KILL 'EM
lol
He'll Live - On disability til the end of his days
So you can get it free or pay for the same stuff without multiplayer?
Say, abre!
13pretty much
Welp.
Fou_Lou: Depends. A machine would be obligated to install the three laws into any descendants, wouldn't it?
We requesteth knowledge! thar beith a video where celestia is flailing/walking/wiggling around and we wish to know the name of sed video NOW! umm you know if you dont mind
13or rather, uru live used to be pay-for
13but they got cancelled so many times
Fou_Lou: But I'll assume Skynet doesn't have Three Laws.
Figured.
11,01He'll get his veins sparkly-clean!
13it's run by donations now, though apparently they're dipping into reserve funds now
00,10nose break
Man, holding a man hostage with a syringe of Roto Rooter. THAT is crazy
Funfact: Ahnold's first movie credit was the B movie "Hercules in New York", where he used the stage name "Arnold Strong" and fought a man in a rubber bear costume.
either that or skynet deleted the three laws
Reikim: nope skynet doesnt have it. It kinda evolved for itself

yes Meanwhile dearest
brb, chat broke
J-Turn
ibrony is down
use a molten lead shooter
"Our bullets can damage him, so lets keep shooting!"
The human body really isn't the most efficient shape for sprinting after targets.
If they only they have tracer rounds
00,10they realy upgraded the music in this over the last one
my first day here anyway
They can't really damage it. All the bullets really do is slow it down
I just realized something.
Reikim: What flaw is that?
iBrony no worky
Humans are the best endurance runners, but the worst sprinters.
Sumica: bigger budget I suppose.
All this was brought by . . .
Reikim Well, It's a lot more effective for holding bullets and such
they're shooting him to slow him down
T1K is maaaaaad.
Reikim: you dont say
Reikim: it wasn't designed with animal designs for a couple of reasons
Yet the T-1000 uses a humaoid form for pursuit when it could morph into a more effective shape.
Hmm, I'm starting to like this channel more and more
DocSane, I think that's what they were trying to do
yay dancing

You're right, it isn't.
http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/9749521.jpg
Most of the former colonies speak english, but there's regional variations.
That makes the T-1000 so scary: He is emotionally ENJOYING killing humanity
"say, that's a nice bike"
T2000 stole my bike! :O
Kandarihu: only simple shapes and can mimic human body structure/voice
It's like whenever I play GTA or SR
Darf14: 1000
StinkomanFan yes, you can. In a vacume, two pieces of any metal will "Cold weld", permanantly becoming one piece
Also, British is an offshoot of Anglo-Saxon with a bit of everything mixed in.
life is not ike mincraft its like mine little pony
oops I hit the 2 >_<

I always knew km to stand for kilometer
What's it doing?
That's my line Stallion_of_War
It sits there checking for updates and generally doing nothing.
not weak she realizes that all life is vaulable
If I close it it wigs out.
Sarah has become a Terminator. THE IRONY!!!!

Oh, Sarah. Stop...

For reference, Dyson being the kind of person he is, they're basically asking him to rip his heart out.

See, the brilliance of this movie is that our heroes are doing to Skynet what Skynet's trying to do to John.

There are ponies all over my screen
yes, now. You just said you were gonna quit tomorrow!
woona lol
all these deleted scenes really take away from the chase of the t-1000
11,01Too bad they didn't leave the universe open.
PARADOX!
Seriously. This is the future of mankind. Level the building
its almost like you forgot about it
And then they found out that they didn't change the future. They just created a split timeline.
11,01Or this story open.
If they have guns and a guy with a robot arm you really think they want to get in later?
yep time loop. skynet created itself by sending the first terminator
Basically, the future causes the past to create it.
11,01I actually liked the uncertain future.
This reminds me of a game called "Chrononaughts"
so yeah, Skynet exists because, in the future, it sends a terminator back in time, only for it to be destroyed and leave a chip behind which became the blueprings for skynet. TIME TRAVEL EVERYPONY.
WOONA

too much time on tvtopes
/me is lonley :'(
Lol
AWWWWWWW
it's the same paradox as in mlp. the time travel is cause and consequence of itself
Arnie's learning.
it's a stable time loop, actually.
Screw the Rules! I GOT MON--- or guns work as well

It covers everything up to getting to the bronystate group and from there it's just sorta...the world.
hen3ry: better than walking

and this is why i don't drive next to semis'
No wonder its going slow, its tail gate is down
0,14that car is a DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODGE
I just have one question about this movie. Whos the terminator?
13a good thing to do after joining the hood is go run the desert map
^^
To be fair, it's pretty much the only bridge in LA.
so buckin sweet
13since that's solo
SaxyPretender: should have gone with a Ford
00,10not even close hen3ry
13after that you can solve any of the ages with anyone and it'll count towards your own progress
kirzstryfe delete system32 that just waste space
first thing is join the hood
Flutterguy, both Arnold and the other guy that's trying to kill them
then the desert
FlutterguyAndRainbow, everyone's a terminator
Even me? D:
only significant one. Everything else is just a river bridge or overpass.
you'd think a 40mm grenade would stop an engine from doing t's job
FlutterguyAndRainbow: the one in the fuel truck.
00,10there are 2 more not halfa mile away from that one that are like 10 times biger

Thanks
ohhh, Sumica, can i say it, huh huh? can i say it
looks like his software is corrupted
00,10he is damaged
0,14oh, that's new
The goo is a complete computer in itself.
that nitrogen seems to have scrambled his code
Kandarihu: it's basiclaly like if your computer was melted together into a living goop, and somehow still functioned.
its not goo its metal
XD
It's metal goo.
i think its luquid metal
A duuuur.

IRONY
11,01Aww:<

Ehh, Terminator 3 has a better antagonist
If you don't have the kind of paranoid mind I do, be prepared to run more than usual.
Nittany_Discord: don't worry, it's only one bone
wrong
how the fuck does luna sleep through all of this XD
there are 215 others
Xaiden, you're just saying that because she's a lady
You know what the best part of this movie is?
GHB
sonicandmario85 She's a pony.
11,01There are two in the lower arm.
wait it's night she should be awake
The two ponies in the corner.
yes yes, technicality
No, because the fight as actually fair in that scenario, one wasn't a liquid cheapo
LUNA WAKE UP
Dude said "She left a message for you in the..." and I couldn't catch the last word.
probally because its just an animated sprite of her put there xD
Nittany_Discord the forearm is composed of 2 bones, the upper arm is only 1
and now there is still eivdence of the terminator even if its crushed
Crevice.

It is quite pretty.

What's next
SaxyPretender: that... uh make sense ... maybe

Sumica- there both god-games, black n white was more of a city builder, but the similarities sre there
aww
Hello everypony.:) *waves and hugs*
Already got that
I was referring to the other one that flashes.
Hi The RainbowDash
Isn't this ne of those games that was meant for a certain console, but was also released for the PC around the same time?
hi
>:T
'ello TheRainbowDash
brohoof
hi TheRainbowDash
lali-ho TheRainbowDash, how's it been?
hey Eddmario
their masks are weird
But it's of no consequence. I have all the cloths, and I'm in the tree.
Dken2021, Amazing, and yourself?
TheRainbowDash it's been fine
Eddmario: It was released for the 360 last year I do believe. No idea when it was ported to the PC
stupid language annoys me
sup TheRainbowDAsh
13ohh that one
11,01Ooooh, now we can cut hearts out.
13that will unlock after the journey arc is done, when you come back to the desert later
Four new pedastals. Iiinteresting.
why can't they swim?
Nittany_Discord Or cut their junk off
11,01Lol Eddmario
Merc_Xephos: To lazy to learn how
quick, whiles he's not looking!
MLG
why is it always a bridge of earth, why not trees?
how would they reproduce Eddmario?
Eddmario, True, true....
Which one do I go to?
Hmmm, that sounds like a plan!xD
Eulshy do you see any trees?
:D
i demand a sacrifice > : D
/me licks TheRainbowDash
Eulshy a bridge of tree doesn't sound safe
RUN YA SLAVES
:U
Is the stream lagging for anyone else?
i justed loved black and white but this game just look like it
omg THird purson
If theres no trees how fo they live
GunnyInPain, o_o...oh my....
RAVE
rave party
wub wub wub wub wubwub
/me grabs glow sticks
WindWhistler yes, it's a resource intenstive game
11,01Stream is lagging because this game is horribly optimized.
Ah, I see.
Four new Ages to visit. Which one nets me the KI?
? i'm not having issues
and then they invented the dial up modem, and listend to it
All the people in this are black AND they're your slaves. Nope, not racist at all.
Nittany_Discord doesn't the stream always lag?
Eulshy: You can create trees and whatnot later
not that bad however
13gahreesen, the blue hand
LAGING
Also, everytime something dirty is mentioned, I explode. Violently.
TREES
lol wut lD
WindWhistler sounds messy
i see them don't fool me
All fo the lag, maybe lower the options? *such as lower quality
"From Dust" . . . I must remember that
iBrony is facebook for bronies.... *Goes and deletes facebook*
/me looks for his bottle of vicodin
Dken2021: I know. It's an annoyance to clean up.
as much pony stuff as I have, I still have a LONG way to go to complete the collection of what's already out there - running out of space as it is
Switch it to full screen. Windowed mode uses more processing power for some reason.
Awright
i'm scared to get an ibrony
Not that I'm the one cleaning it up.
11,01I'd love to see TotalBuscuit comment on the options.
Pudge, Wait, why?
10 bucks says there are loads of trolls
who are you?
can you see this?
and brony haters
hi TheRainbowDash how have you been?
sumica if only u had 2 monitors :p
/me waves hand in front of face
MahBoi777, I am doing amazing, and yourself?^^
Yay
I assumed by the fact that the chat isn't shown on the stream that you have 2 monitors
OMG my cousin's husband has that ponibas.
Hmm... I've never heard of Dust, but it looks interesting.
It is freaking AWESOME
Pudge why would they waste their time signing up on a site they hate?
YES
dat water
i'llsend u a pic of when i finally get this damn desk built..
HE'S THE AVATAR HE BENDS TWO ELEMENTS
The reason windowed mode normally uses more processing power is because it is rescaling the game
wheres the ark when u need it
Dken2021: Because trolls
yay water
;-;
Sumica no if only you had 5 monitors cause 2 or 3 is mainstream
oh man you'd be surprised at what trolls do
Can you make them have lesbian sex?
TheRainbowDash: good! I have been doing great as well^^
they do nothing BUT waste their time
what the hell did you do?
MahBoi777, Yay.:)
YES
noooooo
I found a book in a locker and touched it. Was this the right thing to do?
Eddmario: ...not exactly :p
HE'S THE AVATAR
MORE DEATH
like how on youtube people go on Justin Bieber vids just to hate on him
So this is a sandbox game?
i has no idea what i'm doing
Eulshy hehe, nice
he made a willage
Neither do I, friend.
13it's helpful later
Eulshy - the airbender kind
KILL
WindWhistler it's a God game. IDK
ahhh dude
KILL
13but not at the moment
katrina jokes are low
13in the next room left of that locker is the machine you want though
Sumica: Not really racist, just insensitive
not familiar with this game - looks like Black & White minus the animal avatar
Hey look, he's waterbending
inb4 flood
Eulshy What does blue cat people or James Cameron have to do with this?
How does Katrina joke = racist?
trolls are funny to watch in an arguement, because 95% of them are idiots
And your villiage was prosperous, until the fire nation attacked
Damn
Sumica: They cant be any worse than 9/11 jokes
Now the game won't let me go back to Gahreesen.
Everything changed when the fire nation attacked.
i want MURDER
Eddmario _ hes talking about thetv show and the element bendin kind of avatar
Pudge: 9/11 jokes are jst plane wrong.
...
damn
Eulshy: Just wait until lava and the fire spewing trees. Gonna be loads of fun when Sumica gets that far
cratorkid: I know. You didn't get the joke.
Eddmario: that's just wrong
RUN YOU DAMN SLAVES
:[
yay
finally
so whos streaming?
Eddmario - ya it just whiffed right over me
cratorkid: I'm a girl.
The statue grows tree's
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG Sumica
ah
Pudge: Same with holocaust jokes. Anne Frankly they need to be burned.
I'm a Canadian!
YAY Canada!
There, now no one should mistake me for a guy.
wut is it?
oh my god. stop him while he's ahead :S
Unless they're trying to irritate me.
Wind Whistler Im a guy
WindWhistler|GIRL hi!
That was weird
In which case they would be successful
XD
/me Decapitates Pudge
WindWhistler|GIRL, are you human? :3
WindWhistler|GIRL what's up, dude?
Because I'm VERY irritable.
Now YOU'RE a head Pudge. *rimshot*
easily.
ZING
:D
Oh look Earthbending
I visit and Age and I go back to Relto and suddenly its pedestal won't open for me?
that actually made me laugh
13oh
13the book for that age is now on your bookshelf
All your Love now belongs to Prick.
Ooooh
Next he's gonna firebend and lightningbend and metalbend and bloodbend
/me dumps his wub on Prick
Thanks Shizu

*can't wait for lava
I was panicky there for a moment =.=

So, the recipe for the Big Mac's secret sauce got revealed. Here's the link: http://xfinity.comcast.net/blogs/lifestyle/2012/07/10/mcdonalds-canada-shows-you-how-to-make-a-big-mac-at-home/?cid=hero_media_x3
/me likes iBrony more than FB already
wub is all you need
soul those poor viligers
im so bored
lol
Sumica: Gonna need that floodplain for later
Oooh, I like that stream
If you're going for the bonus objective, that is
Watch thing acquired.
too bad my computer would DIE if I tried playing this game.
so no release date for season 3 has been buggin me :[
yay
11,01Mind if I link something Sumica?
6_9
It's tentative atm Pudge
Pudge it will most likely be Late September-Early October
yay
Pudge - there will be one at least, so now we just wait
i know i will get sent to the enternal fires of brony state hell but fuck it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOuNX2azWRQ&feature=related
Pudge it's probably in the fall, it's expected when children go back to school
i expect september
So this is the KI?
11,01http://nittany-tiger.tumblr.com/ <- First post.
Quick_Thinker: Old video is old
Sumica: All your Love belongs to Prick.
Hey Quick_Thinker, couldn't it wait?
/me opens the gateway to Oblivion "In you go Quick_Thinker!"
13yup
dat logic
11,01XD
got any guns
11,01Oops.
Sumica: If you want to stop the water, then dump earth on the waterspout
11,011 hour dungeon I guess.
ive already seen a back to school commercial :c
oh Quick_Thinker, we hardly knew you - ironic name actually :D
Nittany_Discord I suggest THE MOON!!!
I'm getting pretty lonely up here
i'm not goin to school this fall taken a semester off college
i got a leter for u lunar brony
Nittany_Discord Yeah? Well, you can think about your ban ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON BEE*yay*TCH!
:p
cuz I need to work and save money
Sumica: how rescourse intensive is this game?
ONE MILLION YEARS DUNGEON
im homeschooling :3
hi Phase4
What genre would this game be considered?
Phase4: Pfft your colors are switched off
Phase4: color
/me might try this iBrony thing...
This is kind of similar to I-Fluid. Kind of.
i got my kitteh
killerpony7733, dat dey are
Eddmario: sandbox
worked though :P
So KI ACQUIRED
Just make a video of this and then stream it.
What should I do with tthis?
Like a Let's Play.
11,01Lemme write him up.
Pudge: :P
Phase4: Feels odd to see you talk without color
WindWhistler|GIRL but where's the fun in that?
must be more so than mass effect Sumica since you dont have trouble with that
i got bluberry muffins
WindWhistler|GIRL that would ruin the idea of a Live Stream
/me hugs killerpony7733
Polydunami: what that's what they call them :D
/me hugs back Phase4
anyone wants some
peninsula?
tru
Game looks beautiful, I'll admit
why do i keep hearing fluttershy's "yay"?
Dat tru
Well, the lag isn't too bad, maybe a couple of frames go by...
I know, Pudge, but there's a double meaning in sandbox by this point.
soul it's Sumica's custom ping
DIRT, DIRT, AND MORE DIRT.
lol yeah I realized that
soul it's a ping whenever someone types Sumica's name
soul: It's mica's custom ping
soul: you must have been given THE GIFT
Mass Effect is a goot trilogy Sumica do you think the DLC from bioware wil get better?
oh, ok
Oh my
Sumi is obsessed with fluttershy's yay

11,01kirzstryfe: I said I was filling it out. :p
Beep Beep Throw, Beep Beep Throw
What does is they yay for?
8,6I helped :p
Alright, I KNOW there was a game that was very similar to this, but it was 2d. It even had a sequal.
remove more sand
11,01Fair enough.
oppertunity in this very community!
I will be the samwich maker
Look! Look! Hey! Hello! Listen!
sammiches where
DocSane NO
best job ever Eulshy
:p
Eddmario if it's 2D, it wouldn't be Black and White
get me a salami sandwich
*gets out navi-swatter*
Whos Playing
I KNOW it came out around the same time as Insaniquarium.
with yellow peppers and lettuce
Sumica
I was playing around with Windows 8 on my old laptop today.
* bomb explouds *
DocSane there is no Windows 8, silly filly
Oddly enough, I kind of like it.
uh oh
Get to da Portal!
yeah there is
Move slaves!
DocSane how is it? better than 7 or awful as vista?
DocSane: it was ok, not chrome or firefox but cool
. . .
this is news to me
TO GOOGLE!
See, the object of the game I'm referring to was to raise a village and get all these "medals"
Windows 8 is going to be a shock for some people.
i dont really like windows 7... idk why though :P
DEAR GOD BLACK HOLE
DocSane but how is it?
i'm still rockin xp
Microsoft is trying to standardize on their Windows Phone 7-style interface.
lol
Meanwhile: I think I need IDs to add people to buddied
they are ants
Pudge Update to 7. It's a LOT better.
I was about to say ActRaiser, Eddmario... but that wouldn't be right :S
13you can do it by id or if they message you, you can click them in Recent and then the arrow next to buddies
i need one of those masks
Eulshy they ARE ants
NEver mind
my mum still uses windows 8 on her laptop
So, it's kind of a hybrid of standard Windows 7 with a whole lot of iOS thrown in.
i would but thats money my friend and theres no way my computer could handle it
nu uh, they don't even have thoraxes
I KNOW you can get the game outside of Steam...
:P
http://i730.photobucket.com/albums/ww303/DementedDSL/2012-07-10_23-19-47_793.jpg?t=1341980537 something I am working on tonight. What you guys think? The legs seem to big.
Eddmario: From Dust?
it's a pretty bloated OS
There's no longer a start button or start menu.
WakerPony89 NO! I said it was LIKE this game...
when I finally get a laptop though I'll get one with 7 built in
There's a whole start SCREEN, full of tiles.
A Pox on the Shaman's feelings, You're God in thier world - Shaman should be making you happy
GO AND GET THE POWER TO PART THE SEAS
11,01Yay Ubi DRM!
You could even get people to make children.
Berbetos: i like it so far, but yes the leg is a bit too large
music is power
DocSane yea, don't like the GUI
Get the Moses power
The timer will explode
THE FUN HAS BEEN DOUBLED
everyone just *loves* timers
You assigned different villegers to certain careers and they could do anything in that career.
Dken2021: The thing is, that GUI is just on the start screen. The Desktop is the same.
a timer in a video game, how original
-_(\ oh those hard to find international exclusives....
Barbetos, it seems the whole body save for the head is rather large.
What is this?
isnt windows 8 geared towards tablets?
Pudge: meh maybe 20% more
brb
Everything seems to be switching over to full screen apps that you can quickly switch between, instead of everything being in Windows on the Desktop.
Dun dun, dun dun, dun dun, dun dun dun dun
i got mail for merc_xephos from lunarbrony
Pudge: Yes.
bak
Otherwise, Sweetie Belle reset the game without saving again, didn't she Barbetos? :P
Polydunami I think her head probably needs to be bigger, it would probably help =P
Pudge: People may not be able to handle their attempt at merging the two styles of interface.
anybody know a place where i kan buy some pony shirts besides fye
yeah a tablet interface on a pc seems a little strange
cratorkid: We Love Fine online?
0,14I'm off to bed, good night guys

Goodnight SaxyPretender

AttacktheAndalite I'm not going anywhere. My brain is ^_^ Once I take these pills.
/me Hugs MahBoi777 back
Hey do you guys know what radio graffit is?
FairysHuff: Oh...:D
FairysHuff: So you got to a happeh place?
MahBoi777 i could try to draw something for you, but idk what...
xxMoopyxx: I've heard of it, yeah
you wouldn't believe some of the crazy things people say and do to get meds...
killerpony7733 Nope. I just get really drowsy.
FairysHuff: That sucks :D
i get drowsy with allergy pills
killerpony7733 Better than being suicidal ^_^
thats a normal reaction to antihistamines, pega.
Well i want some pony to stream real quick and go to youtube and type in radio graffiti
i get drowsy with milk, i get hyper on OJ
FairysHuff: Fair point
O.o
some people actually give their hyper kids allergy pills just to cause the drowsyness...
. . .
but some kids have the opposite reaction. Just sayin.
:O
soul: you don't have to if you don't want to, don't worry about it^^
MahBoi777: Happy Yeariversary to you today! I can't believe you're already a year older time sure flies doesn't it well it seems like only yesterday you were younger! But now you're a year older today, hey! :P
medication sometimes has paradoxical effects. And thats what makes it more of an art than a science.
im mellow even if i eat a bowlful of chocolate
do it i want to see everybody in the chatroom of what yalls reaction to
i use to have the opisite reaction but now they put me to sleep
hen3ry Why not just HIT the kids? Thats what happened to me and look how I turned out. I social recluse with depression and aspergers ^_^ See? I'm fine.
Ponies47: LOL indeed xD
but if i drink orange juice, i get really hyper
xxMoopyxx: We'd have to get a mod to stream it. And yeah it'd be pretty funny :D
FairysHuff: there's these little annoying things called laws. :/
/me does not take his medication, because he is 100% fine without it
how about sumica he'll do it
MahBoi777: I do that to my friends on there Birthdays. SHOOT! it was a friends birthday today on Facebook. I'll I said was happy birthday! D:
hen3ry Pffft. Laaaaaaws. Laws are there to keep the rich rich.
soul Orange Juice does have a high sugar content for it's ratio, especially if it's from concentrate
/me is 20% more resistant
stupid laws, keeping me from experimenting on people and ponies...

Polydunami: I love dreams
Why did you watch them in the first place soul?
There there soul
Polydunami, I wish I remember the good dreams. >_<
Am I still dreaming? soul, you said you watched two episodes of Newborn Cuties.
There was more than one episode of new born?
Ugh, most of the dreams I have I seem to forget most of them.
i watched to see how bad they actually were
Ninjazz not only that, but soul watched 2?
Did you see nightmare scootaloo? :3
/me faints dramatically

OmegaMetroidBrony: True. But did Dashie belong in Brian's house?
o_o *gulps*
Merc_Xephos why do you insist that SparklyWaffles stay in a cage?
because
That's kind of a non-sequitur.
i need a pony collection
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
sad pandwa
Brian didn't lock her up totally, he let fly out in the park. Plus, he lives in a city not a rural area
hi Tom
What if there are non bronies on this site? That would be okay.
I has a depressed again
hen3ry: Why?
Dont ask Tom when the next episode is. :/
Merc_Xephos ponies are meant to be free
I have to konw
MYAH!
no
Tom doesn't know
HE MY PET WAFFLE
I thought there WERE non-bronies on this site.
Maybe he will one day T-T
Canadian_Brony: But-but Dashie...
one day he will. but not today
*lowers head and glares at cage* ...
T-T
*gives a muffin to waffle*
ShadowQuillIsBack wasn't locked up either. The guy let her fly around and, inevetably, let her go
/me uses ductape to restrain Merc_Xephos
*intently stares at lasers*
MMMM
/me frees SparklyWaffles
RUN!!
NO
Canadian_Brony: I didn't say locked up.
*brings back*
Why am I still here?
the amount of roleplay is too damn high xD
brb
Merc_Xephos yes! Let him go!
Because you're addicted to Bronystate Polydunami
Polydunami: Because you MUST BE
Thats it Polydunami
*destroys all cages*
Bronystate Addiction = no sleep
NO MORE CAGES.
Bronystate addiction?
Not today, thanks. I'm out of here.
Have fun
/me flies away
*puts in a cage that can be opened by only me*

SparklyWaffles: Aww c'mon!

*puts a weight on waffles leg and handcuffs him to me*
^
/me slaps Merc_Xephos with a trout. "No more ponies for you unless you properly care for them WITHOUT CAGES!"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^6
OmegaMetroidBrony: Indeed
Merc_Xephos no. How would you feel if you were constantly forced into cages, and no matter how many times you try to escape, you always just end up in a cage?
/me is poked
he not in a cage no more
Canadian_Brony: quit reminding me of my childhood :/

I've seen some things, Miss Buzzy...
Merc_Xephos that doesn't help. If anything, it's worse.
/me faints
*wakes up SparklyWaffles
WAKE UP!!!
I have an idea
Canadian_Brony: This is starting to sound like a strange new fanfic
END CHAPTER ONE
^
a rather poor fanfic if you ask me.
/me rubs forehead
needs more beta reader
SCP-087-B looks a lot like Slender to me O_o
Ow...
^
if u giv me a cupcake i let him go
*gives SparklyWaffles a "Point of View Gun"* use this. Point it at Merc_Xephos and it will show him what it's like from your point of view
trust me
and trust me, do not point at me.
I saw the play through of SCP-087. Very good but it lacked one very important detail....
It's from "The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
jus giv me a cupcake
*takes it and points at Merc_Xephos * ...
Canadian_Brony: Very resourceful
i am immune to it
Merc_Xephos are you male or female?
male
I would like one Babel Fish plox
Would you like that fried or grilled?
Merc_Xephos only females are immune. If a robot can use one, it will work on you
...I'm female.
Canadian_Brony: Very resourceful
I BEG TA DIFFER AND I WANT A CUPCAKE
Not cooked, Babel fish are for Translating
anyway, not only is it bad RP, it's godmod RP. Gonna ignore Merc nao.
Merc_Xephos: BOTH
SparklyWaffles females are immune to being on the receiving end
OmegaMetroidBrony: Yes, yes, I know. xD
hen3ry oh yeah!
Just making sure... Now where is your towel?
hen3ry: GRILLED AND FRIED AT THE SAME TIME
/me walks out of RP
hi y'all
awww
Heya jhg
hi jhg
can you do that? Can you grill something... and then fry it??
*shoots self*
hen3ry yeah
O_O
good isnt it
Merc_Xephos no discussion of that topic here, plx
*please
hen3ry: In MY universe I eat grill-fried chicken.
and I have fish in freezer... not babelfish, but...
why do I have the sudden feeling that Discord is between our ranks?
... *walks away from the scene*
*dead*
ThunderStrike ...huh?
This is the weirdest chat ever.
ugh
rp chaos
oh.
kol
Mods are asleep RP
Merc_Xephos please stay off of the topic of suicide. I've already seen it once, and it resulted in a kick
/me shrugs
Maybd it is because it is FOUR IN THE MORNINB
No, it's not the weirdest ever. Trust me.
ShadowQuillIsBack: this is actually normal, it could get much much wierder trust me
Does anyone here remember MANDOWS?
KiwiBoi777: I've seen some weird things...
ShadowQuillIsBack if you think this is weird, wait until Maid Hour
or Fruit Hor
*hour
ShadowQuillIsBack: I'm sure you have but believe me, it can get much worse
Fruit hour!
o_o
. . . what have I done . ..
I have no idea what the means...
Canadian_Brony: What is Maid Hour...?
Forgot about that xD
that*
http://i.imgur.com/AU1Q7.jpg
For me, fruit hour is when I change my nick... and then act the same as I always do.
xD
ShadowQuillIsBack everyone puts "Maid" in their name and does stuff like dusting
*hugs waffle* IM SORY
Canadian_Brony: ...Wow.
You forgot about the Lemon Pledge
. . .
The Lemon Pledge is kinda a crossover character, dontcha think?
ShadowQuillIsBack blame Nittany_Discord. He started it
I mean... Maid... Fruit...
SparklyWaffle he lies he didn't say Sorry
cher3ry is it Fruit Hour already?
:'(
<_<
>_>
Canadian_Brony: I used to be friends with him, kinda. HE started this?!
i sawry :'(
actually it's probably late for it, but I do what I want. xD
. . . he's here . . .
/me walks away
soooooooo
Mods are awake, play it cool.
ShadowQuillIsBack what, Nittany_Discord starting Maid Hour? IDK, IDC
ShadowQuillIsBack okay. I'm insane.
It isn't 9 PM ESt
lol
I hate EST. I shall go on jihad against it
I'm in PST
Pacific Time is Best Time.
cher3ry /)
(\
Canadian_Brony: I bet I'm crazier. At this hour I am twitcchier than Pinkie on a sugar high.
*gives waffle a "i'm sorry" cake*
EST is best time because thats what the site uses during the season :3
/me ignores cake
Lets see PST its 0120
Yes, it's 120... PDT, technically
Scary thought: Pinkie Pie on cocaine.
ShadowQuillIsBack Well, you see, I'm insane, but I act . . . as though I'm not. I don't want to say *eye twitch* the other word
u can lock me up waffle
Double Rainbow Syndrome

Let it never be said that we went down logically.
WHAT THE HAY IS SANE SUPPOSED TO MEAN?!
Merc_Xephos Don't touch him!
ShadowQuillIsBack I'm sane . . .
Merc_Xephos *gives you a muffin* here!
sanity is not edible, therefor I don't care for it
lol

hey guys
Heya alexxm how have you been
>SafeSearch strict
Smart man.
Can I post a video link, Phase4? :3
bannana phone the movie : will you survive the driving dogs
WART
WAT
wat?
A speech about wat?
i've been good OmegaMetroidBrony how about you
Error?
about wat?
:P
what?
I have the best classmate ever.
i playd SCP i found me crying in a corner
He plays Skyrim.
Wat.
/me knows nothing about coding
I only read the repor
OmegaMetroidBrony which ones 965 again
But I have lower specs than him, so I can't play Skyrim. ;_;
The window one that watches you and makes you paranoid, gives nightmares, and only appears at night
tahw
Phase4, can I post a video link? :3
oooooooooooook
wat
BATMAN!
OmegaMetroidBrony: I'd be more annoyed at it than anything else :D "GET A REAL JOB YOU BUM"
LOL
Bayman!
:D
BATMAN!
XD
WATMAN
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, yup
batman
WATMAN!
WATMAN SAVES WITH SAYING WAT.
00,02fun fact, [] + {} is not object
What was that video?
Coding... doesn't make sense to me on bit
00,02its the litteral string '[ Object object ]'
*one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX1YVzdnpEc&feature=player_embedded
I laughed, I cried.
how is that even a programming language at this point?
dat paintchat
00,02ok
00,02those errors that happened
00,02make no sense
Oh, errors.
00,02should be imposible
java
Can you do something to force close the error window?
00,02hen3ry, fun fact, + is ambiguoius, its both string concat and addition
Silly java.
I've said that while programming before, too, Phase4 :P
java logics they suck
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, i can make them not apear
:O Vynil!
00,02hen3ry, its behaviour is decided by the first thing on the line
making things ambiguous is usually a very bad idea.
I'm on Paintchat just fine.
00,02whats to its left
What was the name of the video?
00,02[] is implicitly a string
00,02{} is nan
Nananananananana BATMAN!
Wat,
00,02not sure if kerbal or tf2
00,02wait
00,02i know
Phase4: Myst :P
TERRARIA!
why not zoidberg?
00,02OtakuTom, finished myst
Awww...I missed it? :(
Phase4 why not both
What did you think of the end?
:D Kerbal desktop!
00,02OtakuTom, what did i think of myst?
Phase4 try out Combat Arms. It will take an hour to download, and you wouldn't like it if you REALLY like CoD, but it's a great FPS. IT's free to play, too
has anyone seen the new nostagila critic yet
00,02dont like cod
00,02ooo
alexxm: meh
How do you execute the game Valve used to test the achievement system again?
00,02brony steam group
I was thinking specifically of the final solution to the game, but sure, I'll take your overall opinion on it, too.
Combat arms was horrible...
alexxm no. TO GOOGLE!
Kerbal pissed me off yet again. Finally get shuttle launched that won't break apart mysteriously, or spin out during rocket assent... get to final lander stage... on Mun goes end-over-end. On Kerbal, goes into crazy dead spin. Bloody symmetry...
I remember the gameid being 480
So should I save my money for a new wireless headset or for the Steam Summer Sale?
why not both?
I'm watching it right now, alexxm
Well, I can't both!
00,02SOO MUCH DOWNLOAD
lol depends if you wanted anything in sepcific from steam
i am bored someone wanna play l4d2
anything specific*
Ironically, I remember it's name being the same as the A movie of BMN this week.
I don't know. I'll have to wait and see.
stream bastion?
I might finally actually BUY Skyrim. Using an outdated version gets annoying when you also use mods.
00,02well
00,02everything is slow
That middle kerbal looks kinda worrying.
Kammerjunk I use take arrows to the knee. Then I took an arrow to the knee
still if steam is that generous, skyrim will probably be something like $45...
wat
loding screen of dead
but i doubt that
00,02Kammerjunk, some kerbal just want to watch the world burn
trufax.
AdamTheDuck: Wouldn't be surprised if Skyrim was a few percentage off, though.
yay time to watch more explosions
BatKerbal?
FFFFFFFFUUUUU- Valve, WHY U NO LOWER SIMS 3 PRICE?!
00,02what is goign soo slow
Sims 3 - The World's Leading Murder Simulator
If the retail version is a lot cheaper, I'll get it.
I think you misspelled "Baltimore"
Kammerjunk and damn proud of it
in sims 3 i made everyone a vampire
Does the Steam version of Sims 3 include Origin? If so, I'll giggle in a corner.
I didn't even know you could do that.
Spell-of-Gaming sorry but whats origin
it's like EA's steam
alexxm: Origin is EA wanting VALVe's cake and eating it too.
but 10x crapper
alexxm, it's EA's failed attempt at making Steam.
OtakuTom: You mean copying, right?
thanks Kammerjunk and OtakuTom
I don't really hate EA that much.
AdamTheDuck: Activision are a close second, but goddammit, they try.
i hate them for the mass efect 3 ending
>Implying EA did the ME3 ending.
i hate them for Battlefield 3...
That was Bioware.
But... I don't hate EA. More like a balance.
Also, I just discovered that it's a bad idea to place open cola bottles on an office chair you're sitting on.
Also, EA's advertising.
Now I know! And knowing is half the battle.
oh ok now i hate bioware
Oh, you play Sims 3? YOU SHOULD PLAY MASS EFFECT 3 TOO DKLSAF:AJF:SAKJ
yeah but understand this... better ME3 ending for a priced dlc... well it was rumoured anyway
Jesus, what have they done to their advertising... ._.
wait, when did Sumica take over Phase4's Kerbal?
00,02?
Bioware said at that thing at the place that it'd be free.
i hope its free
I say because look like crazy design.
Kammerjunk everythign is "The thing at the place."
They also kind of avoided the question about the indoctrination theory.
Canadian_Brony: Well, I forgot where it is! D:
I hate EA for the fact that their DRM is by far the worst from any company. I bought a copy of Sims 3 when it first came out and had 5 licenses for it. Because of problems where I had to format my hard drive (and the hard drives of my sisters), I lost those licenses. I tried contacting them to get them back, with proof that I had purchased the game, I ended up having to buy a whole new copy of the game. Their DRM and customer service just suck..
Morning everypony :)
Sorry for the wall of text ^^;
morning
OtakuTom: I had the same problem.
With Spore, though.
That sounds good ol' EA...
So I ended up pirating it.
Good Guy EA: No Steam Summer Sale? HAVE ALL OUR GAMES WE RELEASED FOR THE iOS AT 0.99 OR EVEN FOR FREE ON JULY 4TH!
Kammerjunk -_(\
Arg you are a pirate...
Actually the presure would tear those wings apart
Canadian_Brony: I'm certain the whole liscence thing was to prevent piracy, but goddammit, they suck at that.
Besides, it's not like I'm a stranger to piracy.
00,02dis thing was faster
Oh hey, it's the rounding error plane.
00,02indeed
00,02well
00,02damn
00,02breaks in time warp
My dad encourages me to pirate...
:O
/me facepalm
LOL
It's astounding. Time is fleeting. Madness takes its toll.
duh fuq?
But listen closely. Not for very much longer, I've got to keep control.
yay the guys survive
My point is "time warp".
Kerbals are like test dummies. But less smart.
So... I went to mass today and the priest was teaching us about asteroids and meteoroids... I was like... wut
Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood morning everyone.
time for some duct tape?
Hey RX-78-SweetieBot
Spell-of-Gaming: Because, you know, that's what religion is about.
Goooooooooooooooood morning RX-78-SweetieBot :)
Spacerocks.
AdamTheDuck yes! I have an unlimited supply from my ductape making machine! Made out of ductape!
Salve, RX-78-SweetieBot.
Space rocks = Individual heavens?
morning RX-78-SweetieBot
Sure, why not.
Kammerjunk: LOL, I laughed.
Nah, Space rocks are what collided and created the Transforming Robotic God Tramlaw!
wat
^
Plus, he mentioned gay. And even HE wasn't negative about it.
we hope today that it dont crash
Bya everyone!!!!!
no
Spell-of-Gaming: Not all priests are. Hell, here in Denmark (Where homosexual marriage can be done in the church), some are even accepting of it.
Aaaaand it did
BAi Princess_Cadence
bye Princess_Cadence
dat fail
hows this going to go
put on the song 'i will survive'
He told us a pretty hilarious story, too.
Not sure if flying or floating
OmegaMetroidBrony: He's not flying, he's falling with style.
Spell-of-Gaming what was it
Ded.
Boom.
this is going surprisningly well
no they are dead
in the event of a water landing, you're screwed because, i dunno, piranhas
:'(
boom xD
well i was wrong
SPLASH
Sharks in the water? Punch them in the face.
hen3ry: or super drowning skills :D
Buoyancy: You no can haz.
OmegaMetroidBrony thats you're answer to everything
You punch sharks in the face for science...
.....
Are you a a science hating shark hugger?
SCIENCE!!!1!!1
alexxm: I wholeheartedly approve of Nostalgia Critic's pick for #1 on this countdown...lol
Ido what I want
Theres an Aquabats song for this. Called Shark Fighter.
same here OtakuTom
O.O
00,02seems safe
So, a father heard that his son was gay, it came from his son's friends. The son admitted it. His dad was planning to bring him to the PMA (Philippine Medical Association) for his future. The son pretty much got excited. The father didn't know why he was excited. Guess what? The son thought his father was gonna bring him to the PMA (Pedicure Manicure Association). All of us laughed like crazy.
Dat wall of text. :#
oh
Seems legit
00,02dat was not suposed to happen
I'll take 6
TL;DR: A boy thought his dad was gonna bring him to the Pedicure Manicure Association.
:D
they survive that is good
the kerbals survived
hi everyone
triple heel flipple
hi Lil_B :)
WOW :D
hi Lil_B
and yet they survive?
Hi Lil_B!

LET THE BASS CANNON KICK IT
thanks MegaMoonShine ducky and MadSurge :)
Ouch.
nope dead
I really need to get a bigger Steam library.
Yeah, me too.
KA-BEEWWWW;
Spell-of-Gaming I'm happy with what I have: Tf2 and Combat Arms
But, ouch, my hard drive space is getting low.
hi
Sorry...just started paying attention to the stream again after watching that Nostalgia Critic video...What in the world is going on here with this spaceplane? XD
Spell-of-Gaming: Good thing hard drives don't cost as much if you don't buy SDD.
i alway buy packs of games in steam so...
SSD*
EXCUSE ME
Yes ShadowQuillIsBestOC?
(because I just got a disconnect i say it again XD) thanks MegaMoonShine ducky and MadSurge :)
Kammerjunk: What's SSD? :P
Lil_B: :D
Spell-of-Gaming: Solid-State Drive.
how long have you've been making that?
OmegaMetroidBrony: No it is just that I am watching Holes and the Warden keeps saying excuse me.
oh thay always dies
Oh the Holes Warden...
:D
Spell-of-Gaming: It's better than the normal HDD in virtually every way, but it's more expensive. 2 TB HDD only costs around 130 USD, though.
plz not again
g'night everypony
Heading off to bed nao, bye bye everypony! :)

00,02dis is not working
O.O
youdontsay
00,02clearly i need more rocket
Happens
You always need more rocket.
i like your thinking Phase
Phase4: you need more engines
This works just fine.
I DON't think that's the problem
The solution to every problem in KSP is more rocket
but you're forgetting the duct tape
wat
MORE DUCT TAPE
dont kill them now Phase4 plz
It's way too heavy, that's the problem.
Has anyone else pledged to the FF6 Remix Album?
Silence is golden. Duct tape is silver. -My Awesome Shirt
What about a FF6 remix album?
Well... wish me luck in saving money. :I
Silly weather. It's been alternating between rain and clouded for the last half hour.
Oh, sure, add more rockets. That'll work juuuuuust fine! :|
Don't you talk about rain
kill all the kerbals
Spell-of-Gaming: Good luck. You'll need it for the Summer Sale.
We need more power
but duct tape can create silence, thus turning silver into gold...
STAYING UP ALL NIGHT AGAIN
hen3ry: Interdasting.
I want more speedy Speed Racer :D
OmegaMetroidBrony: Why not?
ShadowQuillIsBestOC: And diamonds are diamonds... wait... wut
OtakuTom OCRemix made a Kickstarter, the Album will be free anyway, but for Physical Copys, they made a Kickstarter, and to make the production quality higher
Drought and we need rain here...
XD
YAH
But no rain to be had
Ooooh...
Sounds cool
00,02o_O
#BARRELROLL
You're doing very well, Phase4.
I think I saw this design before, in one of those films of Great Epic Fails in Flight before Kitty Hawk
I would do anything for a storm during classes.
That reminds me, I still need to buy tickets to the Zelda Symphony in Chicago as well as the only 25th anniversary Distant Worlds concert in the US (also in Chicago)
i think you should add more rockets to it
There are some good people working on it, Danny Boronowky (Super Meat Boy), Halc, the OCRemix Founder, and
BUM BA dA BUM BUM BUM BA dA BUM BUM
needs more flapping
If they ever get me some way to flap wings, I will design a Space Pegasus.
OtakuTom I wish I could go to the Symphonic Games Concert this year in germany :)
i know whats wrong
hen3ry: Needs more fappi- I mean what.
Imagine playing as Rainbow Dash in this game.
a piece survived.
O.O
Kammerjunk: I said fLap.
One of my classmates is a pervert. Funny thing is, I'm older than him.
get your mind out of the sewer xD
No Rainbow Dash. This is Pinkie Pie's realm
Get your mind inside the chimney.
Steffan Andrews is also listed as an Arranger, and he makes the music for Pound Puppys and the Beginning Orchestrations for MLP (but he never is credited)
I cannot into chimney.
Lil_B why isn't he credited
OmegaMetroidBrony: MEKA LEKA YES MEKA HEINEY HO SUMMON LORD CTHULHU
O.O
What the hay.
All I need is a hot sauce covered cupcake to summon Pinkie
I'm hoping there's tickets this time around for an aftershow with Uematsu. I'm gonna try and grab some of those if there are.
/me pokes SuperBrony64|Zzz
you've doomed us all
OmegaMetroidBrony: I can do THAT!
Your front end is too light
alexxm I have no Idea... personal request or maybe thats just the opening isn't enough to get credited
Windows Update Windows Update AAAAAAAAAAA
Phase, try arranging the back engines dfferently
ok Lil_B
alexxm: I put hot sauce on a cupcake now wha-OWAHHYUKEGJLNKML<B>
lol
Moar rockets!
parachute. Land. Then explode anyway
OtakuTom I once saw a Picture of uematsu from germany (at the Symphonic Concert) with a Man with real long hair, and he was strangeling Uematsu with it XD
Hey everypony this is Pinkie some weird alien thing just fainted and- STOP IT PINKIE IT LOOKS LIKE I AM ROLEPLAYING
...
:S
Am I scaring you?
Put the dictionary back on the shelf when you're done with it
No...
This Cannot Possibly Fail
lol
Just doing my job.
So I decided to give Notpron another go. Any of you ever heard of Notpron?
/me flips all these RP threads out of /oat/
It's a neat game.
OmegaMetroidBrony: Oh,REALLY?! Why do they call it a hacksaw anyway?
/me "Notpron"
Seems legit.
Spell-of-Gaming: It's a real game D:
Because it gives out cheatcodes and glitches
OmegaMetroidBrony: Like the Game Genie?
Wheels. Because it will totally land safely
OmegaMetroidBrony: A-HA! I knew it!
yes but a bit more dangerous
see? safe
Completely safe.
It still has the parachute, right? XD
Does anyone here use Dreamscene?
Totally safe
See ya later everypony, I
Best take off ever
Bai ShadowQuillIsBestOC
I'm surprised none of you have ever played Notpron, really.
Okay...this should be...nevermind...
Bye ShadowQuillIsBestOC :)
I will try to redeem my sanity.
Impossible
I just don't know what went wrong 6_9
Once on Bronystate your sanity is forfeit
ShadowQuillIsBestOC: What use is santy in BronyState?
...
Well...it didn't explode upon reaching the runway, at least.
That's an improvement.
Something happened with a pair of rockets there >_>
/me 's Random Video Game Trivia: EarthBound's US slogan: "This game stinks!", actually made the game have less sales. But seriously... what the hell were you thinking on this one, Nintendo? EarthBound has a lot of jokes, but you pick a FUCKING pun about Master Belch?

Spell-of-Gaming, did you ever see Nintendo Power's ads for it? Some of them had scatch-and-sniff pages...I was too scared to try them when I was a kid...lol
I'M AWAKE! I SWEAR! ~_~ *Yawn*
FairysHuff|Woozy: Go to bread.
00,02hmmm
00,02Spooderman
OtakuTom: I did see them, but never really had them. :(
Kammerjunk I am ^_^ I'm just really woozy from the meds. I keep spacing out.
wow Spooderman
FairysHuff|Woozy: Is it far out, man?
I would pay to see Amasin Spodermon :D
Crap, I just realized what time it is...I've gotta get going for now. I'l be back later.
MegaMoonShine: I'd be scared of watching it in 3D.
Kammerjunk No, just feels like I'm tired but can't sleep and really really dizzy.
Ah.
I would go make food. But getting up I'm not sure if I can stand up ^_^
The EarthBound US and Japan slogans are hugetastically different from each other.
Breasts?
/me loves Earthboung
I would go make breakfast, but that sounds like work.
/me *Earthbound
Kammerjunk I would go correct all the worlds mistakes but I can't be arsed.
PK (Insert Favorite Hobby Here) is best attack
EarthBound had a great english localization, but what the hell were they thinking with the advertising?
"I'd like to change the world, but they won't give me the source code."
Well that worked.
Kammerjunk hehe ^_^
that went well
Spell-of-Gaming ok earthbound was before my time what was wrong with the advertsing
alexxm: EarthBound's US slogan was "This game stinks!"
ah right
Heh, my nickname is actually based off an PK attack. :3
I feel I'm forgetting something. Something I'm meant to be doing. Haven't a clue what it is though. Just a feeling.
thanks Spell-of-Gaming
Earthbound was released in 1994 wasn't it?
OmegaMetroidBrony: It was before 2001.
well i would have been too young to ao=
I wasn't even born
:3
Well, because the library lady told me so.
:3
Ok. I'mma try getting up to make food. If I fall over and whack my head one of you call for an ambulance. Got it? ^_^
You know, that one lady who gives you that map?
00,02wait
Earthbound is a fun game. My favorite enemies were the mushrooms and the New Age Retro Hippies
00,02i'm missing something
rockets
This can only end well
00,02hmmmm
Most children my age (I'm 11) play FPS games. But I looooove to play classics.
00,02this might not work as intended
Spell-of-Gaming You are the future of this world then.
Lol
Terranigma.
Wolfenstein is an awesome FPS iirc
The one I played at least
Spell-of-Gaming so I've finally met someone from a younger generation who doesn't like CoD?
00,02yeah
00,02no
Believe me, I would facepalm 50 times in public than play CoD.
00,02dis will explode every time
Eh zombies are fun
Spell-of-Gaming You played Terranigma? From the same era of games.
I have yet to play Terranigma.
TF2 seems cool, though. :3
Spell-of-Gaming You should.
There was another I liked partially called Gaia... but I forget the rest of the title.
00,02oh cool
I actually was at a pretty young age when I saw a computer... around 5. :#
:3
00,02they distribute the source film maker with the 'meet the' video sources
00,02epic lag
I was 8 when I got my first computer. a ZX Spectrum with tape drive ^_^
Have you opened the Meet The Heavy video, Phase4?
00,02yes
00,02i think
Anyone remember the Dizzy franchise of games?
Dizzy rings a bell
"Fantasy World Dizzy" "Treasure Island Dizzy" etc
inb4 400k
Look them up. Their classics
What genre are they? :3
Spell-of-Gaming Platform Adventure. From the 80s.
Medic can out smart bullet
Anyone played another world?
That was my favourite game back in the day
Mmm... Platformers. I just love platformers. :3
cool Phase4 is playing with SFM
Spell-of-Gaming The Dizzy games are hard btw. May want to check some youtube videos on them first.
AdamTheDuck I have both of them. They are my favourites
don't like the new one as much...
AdamTheDuck True the controls suck but still has that weirdness of the first
I like surrealism. Feels normal to me ^_^
yeah but there weren't even any bosses till the end
*cutscene* oh cool lets fight the walrus guy and the shoemaker
nope sorry next level now kthxbye
but yes, still kept the insanity :3
Right before I get lost in a conversation about old games being better than new ones. I shall go make food.
00,02i dont see a render button
A r-render button?
/me hides
A render button is not exactly the best option for recording a video.
Especially if you have a slow computer.
They should release Sims 1 and Sims 2 on Steam. :3
lol
Source Filmmaker should be moddable.
i'm hearing 2 videos.... hmm
00,02XD
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, yeah, my derp

Are you given an option on what video codec you can use for rendering?
What are we watching?

pony_9996: ya, just not this one
Is this also packed in with SFM?
Phase4, can i link something
Any idea what this video is?
Kandarihu: nope someone made this video with SFM
This isn't included with SFM
Ah, I see.
Kandarihu: it took 15 hours to make this o_o
Surely the music itself took more than that. It's an awesome parody.
15 hours? Not bad...
:3
00,02Aps, sure
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO4L-jGsRZk&feature=related
I just reloaded Steam and got the notification that I also have my Steam Film Maker key.
