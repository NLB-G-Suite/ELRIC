Lastly:

reading creepypasta makes this song worse
nukes wont stop it?
the backwards version of this song is really creepy
You won lottery.
Newsletter- We should probably incorporate the newsletter into a section of the site itself, that way we can have news articles and actual reporters
It's only now I realise how creepy that song is.

since you have already more to show than me, maybe i should ask that recruiter if he could use another moddeler/animator
Lol
with that being said, it stands as a significant strong point for us if we can manage to get our own grapple on the news sphere

Saturn: We're trying to break away from reliance on EqD, and become an independant site. As such, direct competition with them is a preferred route

04Any kind of excessiveness is abuse of power
anyone?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the infraction you're referring to is more along the lines of the LotR night of nicks and RP, correct? As opposed to a simple nickchange
ignition 5..4..3..2..1..
04So kickspamming would be, yes

I was volunteering and working on deferred payment, otherwise.

04As long as they aren't used offensively
/me pokes the sleepy ponies with a herring

WMC?
Um, not a lot is happening for me, is it supposed to be streaming yet?
04However, words like "nigger" is still kick/ban material
Haha.
Not yet.
They're workin' on it.
how the hay do i refresh
f5
Got up at 6am just for ponies though.
gwas
i was out with some friends that night :/ was epic movie really that bad?
It means they can never be shown again.

Ew, I hate that
hey
I-I got signal?
FINALLY
Nothings playing for me...

8,1what about exclamations like "cunting cockfathoms"? in all seriousness, are we going to have a defined list of words that are kickable?
same
04But swearing shouldn't be a problem unless spammed
I press play, then it goes back to it's paused position.
/me just refreshed, and nothing is on the stream
no stream

But I want it nao =(
*ding* Done!

XD

...Tag. You're it.

=P
The singla moves at lightspeed though, and at that speed, you can circle the earth 7 times in one seconds...

Not for me =/
Yeah, if there is one cable.

as in the data for the stream
it's not
i dont see anything, bros
04Movies that have nudity would be okay, videos with it would be alright. Again, as long as it's not porn
I just see Applejack
do you have the wrong stream?
<-- presses play and it just goes back to paused
i cannot see

Ok, thanks.
Nnope.
oh dear
Okay
Exactly.
^__^*
This sucks
Guys, just relax.
UGH
It'll be on shortly.
oops
poor Eurostream is experiencing some technical diffculties
using opera
04And that content ratings page would be decent to go by
...
i acidentaly my computer there for a min
my first day ever on this site and its "bad"
This isn't working.
ultra rad
04If it's outright explicit, then do whatever you think is necessary to punish the offender
ARGH
XD
it's not usually like this right?
Ponies are off the rad-meter
Guys.
10,02Let me try again
They banned discussion of that Fic here.
=P
10,02Please relax, we're working on a solution
04But suggestive images shouldn't be too bad
8,1what about violence and gore, e.g.: http://du.cx/1hR (not excessive, some blood)
orly?
xD
They did?
04Blood would be fine
Practically.
Thank Celestia
04But not excessive
Haha
In no way is it usually like this. Tragically there is something wrong at this point in time and we're all just unlucky.
05,15Can we get an example of a pic that would normally be banned, but is now okay?
04We're not aiming for TV-MA
Let us never speak of this again.
^
I hate that story.
lol
it just exited me out of bronystae -.-
With a passion.
Example
lol
I'm not complaining at all, I just state whats going wrong on my end.
it aint working
Sit back, relax, and try not to freak out.
:p
Mainly because of my fanboy nature towards Rainbow Dash
It was semseless lood and gre, nothing more
But.
How long till the stream starts up
give it time people!
:P
:O
Y'know.
and looking forward to the remixes....oh I cant tell you how excited I am about them remixes :)
whatever you do though, don't cross the streams...
yes
i founded it quite enjoyable :3
:O:O:O
Well, it should be up now, but..
http://ih0.redbubble.net/work.7578596.2.flat,550x550,075,f.keep-calm-and-watch-ponies-poster.jpg
ACTA did it
oh
it's gozer's fault
its not like we start watching in the 10th minute guys
Theres some technical difficulties. No worries, it should be on shortly.
advice we can all follow.
/me leans back and relaxes while waiting for ponies
T_T
Anyone excited about next weeks episode, if you already have seen this one?
THAT
we can talk about.
I can't wait for the 11th.
04Looking for one now
I loved that story.
4th is my date...
this is my first day ever on dis site and it ruined :'(:'(
I took off of work for it.
LOL
I have one, but I can't find it.
well don't
*no regrets
I heard it was touching, I need to read it ;u;
:(
04Actually, like say a pony that's been humanfied or whatever that's in a bikini
<--- my background for my computer.
http://i.imgur.com/9h7ju.jpg
8,1or is that too high a level?
You should.
It's a good read. Decent length. Set aside an hour or two for it.
04Can't be too suggestive
Many cried.
04Not too much detail
04For example
me too!!!
:)
i hav nothing at all on my sc- never mind :D
04The Luna picture that shows the outline of her vulva would be considered kick/bannable
win background
here it goes
/me points out that those boots were made for walking
i have something on my screen but nothing on my stream
0.0
I'll keep you all entertained with my old pony folders.

lol
otakon:why?is the episode over and smb. recoreded it yet?
Point and case.
Seems legit.
of*
04Any reference to the story itself would be punishable because of its high gore content
not allcaps now is it?
Hmm I find this lack of ponies...disturbing.
Agreed.
they have to make a derpy episode ASAP
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/6c993302-f0ae-45b8-9beb-272b39a2533d.jpg xD
so,why are all the people here? _D

rarity resembles a marshmellow in one episode
http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=vXgFZgnivXs check it out!
:O
8,1it's certainly higher than TV-14
0,5I heard its bad
04If there's explicit gore, then it's not for us
04No gore, no porn
Supports this

At night!
If you fall up, just pick yourself down.
rn u mad
20% cooler
0,5Question:
0,14So would good practice in regards to warning/kicking, be asking the user to stop, giving them a second warning, and then kick if they still don't stop?
just in the case of a mis-kic/ban, make sure you talk to the person and explain the mistake
Saw a shirt with Rainbow and that phrase at Hot Topic
I GOT DOMINO'S
U PINKIE PROMISED
rn?
strange.

afternoon here
i wish i had hot topic in my town:(
rnagic

movie flaw #1: Her dress grows with her and shrinks back without tearing
its really creepy
I know
magic dress
the NC mentioned it once
04But for events, I'd suggest being there
Ok
-.-
Magic dress
also they have to keep it rated low
04And BMNs if you can
its where wonderland is inside of a house
we missed 'cha.
as creepy as for epic movie
04It's more advisable for you to be there for events
it's trippy enough as it is
The earth is round, there is no up or down.

Suddenly, talking animals

Yup

An elder scroll!

0,5(I wasnt asking, I was agreeing. Heheh)
or the labtop. Which ever comes first
It had "oink, oink, oink"
*hookah
lol
depends on the context
Ie: being called a Lesbian, which, is only an issue because it's being used as an insult.
besides that, it was good
LOL
it's not smoking. It's shisha ;p
All-caps lines are common.
Caterpillar has a hookah.

Getting kicked in the face doesn't make being mean okay.

Yep.
*listens to yoshis island story theme*
which way are the bathrooms?
In before +m that isn't coming.
lol
Fleur: spike winks too
My tab key is trying my paitence
=P
my timing
Intermission time... *thinks about the intermission time in Kung-Pow: Enter the Fist"
Are we watching Epic movie? I need to know if I should go get a gun to shoot myself five minutes in
+m :3
like a hall of shame type thing
gona go to the toilet, stretch my wings, grab some treats and come back. See ya'll in a few mins
hey everybody
do it fillies
oh crap i forgot about the lotto
8,1i ususally play the devil's advocate, but i think +J and +j are reasonable
Okay
I guess while we wait
Equestria
Brb, I require to empty myself
it's closed now isn't it
really like the music
Haha
Let me get a soda.
/me hugs everyone
See you guys soon.
whats wmc?
1,3yeah
NO EPIC MOVIE :)
Worst movie clause.
And watch yout allcaps.
1,33rd movie to get WMC'd
1,3*third
8,1they don't impede normal channel operation, and stop some autorejoins and script kiddie attacks
Epic Movie
Epic Movie did not qualify for WMC imo. It wasnt /that/ bad.
Ahh, ok
Oh, I see!
oh ok thanks
Thanks anyway.
wheres the little fillys room
10,02MakerDusk was informing us that they have many precautions setup to prevent such attacks in the future.
1,3other 2 were babes in toyland and spider-something, not sure on that one's name
Epic Movie wasnt bad
Now This
Is A Movie
00,06I'm aware that they have precautions.
Spider's Web a pigs tale
Second movie is Epic Movie.
(Or have already?)
00,06But it never hurts to be safe ourselves.

I want another Scary, Zomibe, or Fighting movie!!
oh
I wish I would stop feeling like shit. :/
XD
Yes.
I own both but I only upload my stories to FIMfiction
Fighting Movie? Street Fighter?
name of song?
mfw we have a link for that
lets watch the matrix lol
8,1aye; it's never a good idea to take an SEP approach to security and spam
let's watch steamboy
Epic Movie was horrid. I wouldn't even force my worse enemy to watch it
Matrix wud be nice :o
"This movie needs more leverage
If we do watch The Matrix I need to change my A movie pick >_>
I haven random anxiety attacks that make me feel horrid.
its not our choice if i am yet to belive
dat /all/
like extremely sick to my stomach
Yeah, I'm working on a story re: Luna, and a story that was kind of inspired by the ep we just watched.
Oh no >.<
hmmm
this
song
why?
Fic readings are borring
i remeber it
10,02Indeed, but the main argument went away after disabling +n and +G
Babes in Toyland would have been fine if the 90 minute version had played.
To be fair, I can understand where both Fleur and dari are coming from.
okay
i don't like fics fleur
00,06You mean +d and +G
8,1aye, i think those are only useful temporarily
10,02Yeah, +d.
and I'm back
i don't have the patience to read them
00,06And as I had said, they were in place to prove a point.
ty :3
I'm back
Like "Destroy a City" kind -so they attempt to kidnap the Mane 6.
or the reason to :/
ey
or the time for that matter.
Well that seems an interesting starting point :)
I may switch from my laptop to my computer...
I'm back
they basically live to make horrible pop-cult spoofs :P
spaceballs was best parody

Salutations everypony
I can't sleep during anxiety attacks, my mind races to much.
Same.
spaceballs was amazing
we can watch jumumji
It's why games people say are crap sell well.
Follow the money.

Hopefully by limiting the story's perspective to only one charactor I can make it a bit easier to understand
00,06*irritating
Boohoo everyone has an opinion.
Solid
The single greatest parody IMHO is Young Frankenstien.
It had Frankie dancing on the Ritz!
Or maybe even Mel Brooks?
the last airbender was shockingly bad, I'd rather watch the animated series
when is the movie startin
omg yes
it is
Last Airbender kinda counts as a spoof.
Start Praying Boys
13o/ point of contention
wasted my money on the last airbender. the 3d was bad -_--
I already like the sound of it :)
ok
00,06?
the animated seriesisamazng
enope
Spending money on any 3D is a waste.
I wanna see legend of korra.
how long does the intermission last?
13taking the ball away isn't a good way to develop rapport with the viewers
not to put anyone on the spot or anything but... (vo.o)v That.
hence I'd rather watch that than the movie
sorry ther
I find movies with the word "movie" in the title to be, well, not that good
there* had to help out my roommate
00,06I had tried other methods, and they didn't work.
Epic Movie > Disaster Movie
Tally Ho
young frankenstein was awesome too but spaceballs was funnier
I'm comfortable now :)

Sure.
The thing that raises Young Frankenstien above Spaceballs is that in a real sense it can be taken NOT as a parody, but as a proper part of the Frankenstien frannchise-- just a humorous one.
movie
i dont belive in music
<-loves all the ponies
Damn Furry confusion.

Ok, no more voting, let me check this.

hm...
The one with the thing at the place.
+M!
Young Gun?
epic music
winter wrap up because it is clearly needed here in germany
The man botched the film in every conceivable way to such a degree that he had to be trying to NOT make a good movie, because no one could drop the ball that badly.
pick a name at random and they get to pick a pony ep!
All ponies are best ponies, but some are more best than others
