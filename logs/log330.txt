I found something interesting. Not long ago a friend told me that they "officially anounced Jurassic Park 4", So now I've gone and checked www.jurassicpark.com and found out that they are marketing the trilogy box set under this quote from a review: "You won't believe your eyes." I'm sorry, but isn't that like a bad review of a movie where they're trying to make the impossible look real?

Well I'll start off with a copy-paste of the Lit Department's Mission Goals:
oh
lolwut
well enough
Magic is friendship is magic.
dat removed video
The Literature team will be dedicated to expanding the Bronystate community, specifically in areas related to fanfiction. Our goal is to encourage active participation as well as foster individual writer's talents. In addition, the Literature team will be responsible for developing the newsletter. Our end-goal is parallel to Bronystate 2.0: to fashion Bronystate into a global entertainment/media
required, all one needs is enthusiasm and dedication to success. However, ponies who are avid readers/fanfic enthusiasts are preferred.
So if Luna was on earth moon...humans must've helped her go back! I smell a fanfic!

i would but NASA canceled it
Friendception.

This is done in the most annoying way.

-Writer's Blog Site- Derivative of/Linked from Bronystate's main page

srsly.

^
...
Cleanest chat ever. played Epic movie.

I hope I don't wake up my parents. If they walk in on my pony watching at 4:20am...I dunno.

>having parents
Essentially, this will be a part of BS2.0's website, either within the forum itself, or as a seperate tab
Indeed, Dken
son i am dissapoint
did you apply to anything?
I'm 16 :(
420
NO
Pans are much more useful than pots.
BronyCon: the chat must stay fairly clean, but the stream is mostly immune to that rule.
Damn
I wonder how/if they'll censor today's episode for UK
Kill them
ikr
And claim your throne
threw that together last weekend, I "decided" to push the ATG last week so busy with that...
lol 8421
I'm unlucky
underage b&
just that
Ow.. my ears.
even took a test to prove it
Do it. That is the way of the Sith.
omg
the idea is to (either every week or every month) have some featured content from the viewers
my head exploded
did i miss it?
Seems legit.
trixie.exe has crashed
Shit
There must always be two. The master and the apprentice.
Yeah, Dream.
Yes, dream
I'm hounded by the demon of unluckiness
My Beats are hurting
as well as offering constructive (emphasis on constructive) criticism/advice
woooo!
obviously. It was 2 hours ago
I see the apeal of the twixie shipping lol.
I need Trixie to appear in season 2 before it ends
I got the link to the youtube vid if you want.

MY BRAIN!
oh lord
oh what
In the pacific
oh fuck
..........
Not sure if serious
when I went digging Eq:Online wasn't looking for any applications
in addition, since the Lit Department also includes the News team, I'd like to get in interviews with FiM Writers and Story-Boarders if possible
that nostalgia
Not this music!!!
Is it just me or does Rainbow dash's voice sound differnt in teh new episode?
Oh shi
Oh my....
Not sure if awesome or creepy
/me covers ears

and then trixie shows up as a BG character
Oh god the nightmares from my childhood!!

DEFINITELY.
what's this music?
nope, same here
no please celestia

onwards:
and my dog spazzes out cus of pinkie's noice lol.
I don't get it?
Lavender town
0.0
	-gives a chance for users who's work is in progress to get community-based feedback
	-discussion of favorite fanfics
hold me sir
god damn you creepypasta!
the bodies are screaming
Make It Stoooop
It's very noticeable, grayhoof
DEAR GOD
:'(
HELP US
in the forums, we will obviously need a fanfiction section
MAKE IT STOP
oh look, it's the town that gave me nightmares *shutters*
why is everyone freaking out?
shortly after we spoke i was recruited though :D
lavender town creapy pasta
So I've mostly been messing around when I've had the time
it's avander town
seriously, WHY?
Lmo
Lmao
because lavender town
I don't get it
otakon ever played pokemon?
Ever played pokemon blue/red/yellow?
.....
This music scared the hell outta me as a kid, thats why :P
PLEASE CELESTIA MAKE IT STOOOOOOP!
Dken2021|FF1: yeah
i didn't notice...
people like to chat about their favorites and whatnot
Now i wanna to play some pokemon!
oh!
I've read that creepy pasta to
lol he said son i am dissapoint
too*
the ghost pokemon!
Yeah :P
recruited for Eq:Online?
what is creapy about this? aside from the music?
Nuke from orbit in 30 seconds
I love this song. It's relaxing
otakon: Did you not hear about those japanese kids killing themselves when they first heard this?
20
T'was offputting.
10
way back dare
TOY_PON3: enope
in addition, there should be a spot for literature discussion in general, who's your favorite writer/genre/etc
Nuke activated
Suicides from music? D:
no some other project
or something else...?
wait, what suicides are they?
!!!
:D It was creepypasta
:|
ah, well gratz :)
Lastly:
hah no.
reading creepypasta makes this song worse
nukes wont stop it?
the backwards version of this song is really creepy
You won lottery.
Newsletter- We should probably incorporate the newsletter into a section of the site itself, that way we can have news articles and actual reporters
Put on Rainbow Dash Chicken Dance
It's only now I realise how creepy that song is.
asian dad go wha wha wong durger
AWesome
can you mention the project or is it hush hush still? :P
Jim: Indeed
Essentially, we want to be the next big Brony site
This is much better
geno forest hell yeah
dat fluttersing
that means we can't be so reliant on EqD (at least in the long-run)
all you need to do is so super simple
Inglorious..
Ponies..
=P
:$
its even worse at how dark pokemon was
this
is beautiful
dat fluttershy
like actualy was when it came out!
since you have already more to show than me, maybe i should ask that recruiter if he could use another moddeler/animator
Lol
Rainbo Dash chicken dance
with that being said, it stands as a significant strong point for us if we can manage to get our own grapple on the news sphere
wait
think about it
All you have to do is take a shit into the mix! Add a little sweet not sour, some cum just a pinch! Baking these treats is such a bitch, add a teaspoon of godzilla!
I want to listen to
gary oak
are we spiders?
corridor of cupcakes soon?
i cant promise anything though
*desk flip*
This is badass.

*Wha
this gives me the creeps
spoilers
/me hugs everyone
Hai Yellowquiet
NO MORE NIGHTMARE FUEL
lali-ho Yellowquiet
Honestly? We'd need ponies who are ready to compete with EqD. That means scavenging through twitters/blog posts and whatnot, various sites which post brony material often (such as Wired)
Must be scary for those who joined now.
Not sure how they did that =(
i shat myself
I turn on bronystate and this is whats on (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
*hugs back tightly*
Come hide behind the pillow with me D:

woot!
Still wearing my pony shirt.
Scootaloo is brilliant
YES!
05,15Bo Burham rocks
brb gotta water the owl
with the time lag on turn-around we'd be lucky to have the news 3rd string
05,15Yay Bo Burnham
Next week is about Rainbow reading...Just saying.
^
Chicken loves many things
8,1a lot of these goals seem to replicate what EqD does; i have 2 questions: how are we going to be different (and better) to them, and do we see ourselves as in competition with them? i guess this leads to why do we feel we need to be in competition with them for things like brony news and fanfic?
hahaha
Wow
Bo Burnham is my hero.
love is like a nazi chasing a gypsie
she's so funny
chicken can play piano great
inb4 RD cannot read
>Porn is now cool.
so wat u doing here
@Dari: well yes, that's usually the best source of news (since EqD gets that often). We'll need an email for user's to send the info to us (bronystate@gmail is a possibility, though it'd be nice if we had our own @bronystate.com)
haha
Oh God
Reading Rainbow

And so are you, 7677!

She kept her promise

Still hoping for EqD magazine nextweek

autotuned ponies?
hmmmm
EARS! BLEEDING
if we're accepting fanfic, we have to be ready to accept the grimdark along with the happy stuff
jizz
ew
EVACUATE THE BRONIES!
There will be fluttershy eps, Dken2021|FF1, I am sure of it.
t pinkie
the demon was Ganon from the PC game Ledgen of Zelda.
I'd also be worried about setting that up for animation because the lips are too close, but that's probably fixed but manually setting vertex groups
Just wait for Justin beiber
Is this meant to sound bad?
Pinkie Pain
she sounds like drowning
Fuck you, Pinkie.
autotuned
and now I now why CDi is terrible
she said it
she sounds like shes underwater.
it's like she's singing to a fan
JTDrift: that pile of buffalo dung?
:[
Sounds like she's under water.
Bork Bork Bork.
yup.
The singing was Fine why wud u autotune it? O___o
the itallian version is like sex for your ears
instead of letting blender/yourmodelerhere automatically assign and "guess"
:[ Is my rebuttle
T PINKIE PIE
T-Pain made his way to MLP
any other questions?
This is boss
11,01We could filter grimdark/strong shipping to mature viewers or another part of the site.
6_9
Imagine an entire episode autotuned
05,15So, someone could post a cupcakes style story in the Writer's Blog, but it couldn't be featured?
:D
lol!
but then again, maybe you aren't looking to animate the mouth so much *shrug*
/me shudders
00,06*stumbles in hungover* OH LOOK! I'M SEVEN HOURS EARLIER THAN I WAS FOR THE LAST MEETING!
:P
Oh my

Fluttershy is a tree. Your argument is invalid.
8,1ValtheJean: can you answer the other questions i asked?
Meanwhile...In Sugar Cube corner Basement..
ponies need an opera episode

Derpy needs to have her own episode.
Party With Pinkie
^
PLZ!
you meant
Hmm. ..
Nah.

Fire Emblem, I do believe.
That would make this chat explose even more.
boreman2579: eh, maybe
i dont use blender so i dont exactly know what you mean
PLOX!
"The adventure of Derpy Hooves!"
Hiiiiiiiiii
I think so.
who is incharge of stream now?
YES
I demand Derpy episode
becuase that's horse
no, I just want derpy as minor
^^^^
WAHT is this song?
^
00,06Whoo.
PLZPLZPLZPLZPLZ
nah, she shouldnt
They already were about to be sued for it.
Holy shit, what was this song again?
I forgot
rarity is a biatch!!!!
Wut?
Derpy Hooves and Assistant is the closest thing we can get for that.
my fav pony is fluttershy
I dont know the algorithms... but you can tell blender to essentially "guess" which vertices connect to which bone
No idea, don't care. This streamer got dis.
1,3stream is running on autopilot atm
So deal with it.
8,1i.e. what's our motivation for competing with existing services that offer the same things we're proposing, as to developing new features that don't, or sparsely, exist in the brony community?
derpy was considered offensive
aahh
*Okay Guy*
I know this damn melody
Luna FTW
lol
Some Anti Bronies used the excuse that they can't air things that are offensive to Mentally Disabled people.
thet os a fail
well 1 of them anyways
>Truestory.
Fail
Fire Emblem ring a bell?
1,3calm down Seaweedbrain
derpy is well... derpy
Derpy.. is offensive?
1,3stream is running on autopilot atm
so... starting with an open mouth where your "lip bones" aren't so close together would probably be easier for it to "guess"
*facepalm*
poninator
no
HOW
we all you're jealous rainbow dash
cruse control for cool
maybe
That was a guess btw.
Derpy is apperently offensive.
Poniator :D
automatic stuff, i do things myself, then i know its good :)
she is not!
Pfft
this is our stepping into the giant void that is fanfiction
DERPY WITH MUFFIN
yay!
AWMG
could you please play luna remix alexs vs eurobeat brony please
dammit Derpy
Yet half of the other shit airning isn't?
but this is almsot entirely conjecture, I can't say I've animated a face before
Durr

Also, was that some Golden Sun music I heard?

Done!
well we have that oo
8,1i think we need to be careful about how we run this: we don't want to piss off EqD (they're lovely folk), and we want to offer, or at least appear to offer, something that the brony community currently lacks
i have a 900 poly base model
the HAY BACON!
why can it be otakon everyday?
YES

I agree

lol adopted fat child yes. but i like ponies so your argument is null!
thank you good sir
Hai RAWRity
O_o This meta thing has to stop.
why the hay is the signal became normal when i didn't watch the new ep?!
Time to sell your body to science
I like ponies too. Your argument is also null.
/me hugs RAWRity
heya RAWRity
I liked the part where she said yay
where are my pants!
hey RAWRity
I ate them. Sorry.
Well for the main members, I've been watching our current team (inb4 ceiling val). I'm waiting for the skill matrix that will go out before I make my "move" so to speak. In addition, we will most likely need much cooperation with our viewers, so establishing "connections" (so to speak) will be another priority
:[ I SAID YAY!
00,06As far as pissing off EqD goes, I don't think it will quite happen as long as the news we're reporting isn't everything and anything. As I've said before, we really should only be reporting things that are media related (videos, fanfics, etc.) and let EqD report other things, at least for now. That way we can have things be more friendly between us and them, while still giving them a
0,6little competition. Also, Seth is a nice guy, so I'm sure he'll understand that we want to expand.
my hair is a bird so ok
lol
well im going to party hard now :) so im off untill tomorrow. will you be here?
Hi RAWRity

Got it okay thanks bronies
oh noooo
If you look at season 1, there were loads of fluttershy episodes during the final weeks
THis is a moon blaster
1,3today's new episode will be aired right after movie night ends
You'd think She'd sing Alto and Fluttershy would sing Soprano...
Swarm of the Century has one of my new favorite background ponys
11,01Just about becoming like EqD.
lyra is in my top-5 ponies as well
>.>
04I would like to say one thing to Sprinkles: I can understand only reporting things media related, but Val also said they wanted to talk to FiM writers; do you think that Seth and EqD would be okay with that?
ye gods
so sleepy now
Flootershy... Sho GRASHEFUL!
im has lag
I feel relaxed
I'm has sleep depriavastomn

Thank you. I was just curious. I have seen todays new episode already. quite good
oh god
Anyone here know the aware of the pony Holly Dash?

i has that aswell
I could be wrong on this, but I've only seen them interview with directors/va's
the fancy is coming
00,06Yes, Ghosties, stuff like that would be fine.
Why would EQD mind if we talk to FiM writers?
get some coffees
have they actually gone to writing staff?
This hoe.
later Vectasus, have fun at your party
okay, what is everyone's obsession with lyra? does she ever speak?

Like Mareanda Kelly
00,06Granted, EqD does MOSTLY media things, but they do have other things they report, so they'll still feel like others will come to them looking for all news.

eeyup

00,06What we want to do is report the media related news as efficiently and effectively as possible.
just a playlist atm
As long as we don't report all the stuff they do it will be fine
Nooope
human pony??
orait
00,06So that people come to us because we'll have the media news out first.
until Euromovie starts
We can report the stuff they miss too.

par-tay!
I declare today Music Man Appreciation Day
^
nice
07,01Let's move on to our next teamleader
rainbow dash*
04For me, the film idea isn't about matching EqD, it's providing a service that they don't. But yeah, moving on
the go get em
And she only appears for a split second in Swarm of the Century
07,01We have many more items to talk about today
i think it neds to be about 20% cooler
00,06Also...
that feel when you will never be able to hug rainbow dash
derrrrrpy
looks nice^^
and is never seen again
That was a fun ep
can we play some living tombstone after this?

does she have a name?
00,06AND THIS IS WHY MEETINGS LAST FOREVER
00,06Just saiyan
Midnight_Fire: Rainbow Dash killed her for stealing her gimmick.

08,14As you have heard, I hope it encapsulates what you would like to expect to hear when visiting. I will be coming up with more themes, but I believe this should suffice for podcast intro, outro, or even coming up with an animation with it.

07,01Let Vi tell her story first ;)
08,14The radio in Bronystate 2.0 will be a vastly superiour one to what we have now. A separate stream that goes on 24/7 playing original compositions from viewers, as well as pony music, video game soundtracks (provided generously by OCRemix), and other pieces.
rarity :o
No Stream?
Put on RD's theme after this. It's beautiful
im pretty sure acta is a done deal
Mm
there are so many cute rainbow dash faces this episode.

0,14Glad you like it, DWR!
Is there another stream of the episode in 50 minutes?
and BronyCon is still spamming ctrl-r

i studied in art school so when my mom ask why i watch ponies my reason was: "i need to study the smooth animation of various cartoons"
no, the movies
08,14Any questions or comments so far?
Yup, stream works now
Yup DragonSooth.

Say we do a podcast. Would it be like a radio talk show like Drunk Tank?
bue TOY
I still got nothin' :\

Mine's fine :o
I think mips shut us down
:c
04So then you'd monitor the stream all the time?
It was a harry potter quote
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ah, of course, that map thingy
from the maurders map
08,14Fluttercry: The Sunday stream will be existent, even moreso if possible. I may move it to during the week at a time, or do special genre shows, showcasing different genres of music, all request shows, etc.
same with 9gag
i could say i used to live in manehatten..
im gunna go to 7/11 for some energy drink. pcce
later
be nice if facebook was really just one big troll that builds everything up for everyone, then just immidiatly shuts it all down and deletes it or turns it into one big virus redirect.
Then did you get hit by an arrow?
Confound these ponies... I cannot wathc them for the stream is dead

welcome back boreman2579
08,14Ghosties: I would have it up, as well as hoping to get a plugin on the site that shows which song has been played, etc. We can put a flash plugin into the site to give a separate soundtrack to anypony in case they want to take a break from the stream, but still listen to some music.
10,02Is something wrong with the stream?
the name "big mac" disturbs me

0,5Question: Will radio dramas involve team members outside of your department?
Love the top comments are about todays 'letter' xD
08,14Nittany_Discord: Yes.

guys, there is any place where i can find a list of the videos the playlist?
04I'm sure we can find someone else to help write it
08,14LordCelestia: The radio dramas will involve those that fit certain roles. Not every story will have every person, though I assure you that we will all get a chance in part of it. Even I may not be in a story if it does not fit.
Im glad AJ got to shine this week, after being shown up by Derpy. Thats all i have to say until 24 hours pass :P
this is indeed some coke of exclent quality

Why did you have to log out?
/me smacks allcaps around with a large mallet
Did that astronaut (spelling?) explode?
08,14SaxyPretender: How it works so far, script writer writes a draft, I look it over and see the different parts. I ask everybody to record their lines, and if there are any extra characters written in or any places that need to be inserted vocally I look for a team member that does not have a role.
Space!
So many friends!
yes
exit out
he did
0,5Although Im sure its handled at this point, Id be happy to help with scripts if need be.

Was that on pony creator?
troll pony is best pony
but why doesnt he live under a bridge?
checking it out now
literally 4 meters
I'm on Internet Explorer (inb4 everyone bashes it) and it's working fine
Because he gets around, of course.
Because he lives under the internet
drinking pony is best pony
Ok, well how do you make someones name highlight in the chat?
hmmm some anime
*Bashes internet exploserer*

what? IE works for something?
or bold rather
*sigh*

Yayy.

So it makes a noise for you when I just say, Jim
Hi molly
i dont think i have a very strong grasp on what trolling is.
Yep
lali-ho Molly
Oh, lol
If you live in Moscow, Austin, or Japan...
Yes, RaveBrony
see yall
All ponies are best pony.
/me returns Molly 's brohoof
Ok ok, i got it haha xD
Will it have to be exclusively brony music?
manechat is double its usual number.
:o
ok
Does anypony have the link to the new episode?
08,14The biggest thing about Vi.FM is the uniqueness in music choice. Celestia radio is a very well known pony themed radio station. To my knowledge though, they have a constant running playlist of the same pony songs over and over.
The chatters have been doubled!
Google it
look for rugi if u go there
It'll be on here soon.
:3
=P
No, that doesn't sound right...
I did, nothin' worked.
Half an Hour.

I belive otakon 's got it
look at equestria daily, pony_8596
nope
(\
Uh, alrighty
they have all the links
mine went out again
oh
Haha! The chat has been doubled!
the video link
08,14Nittany_Discord: No, any and all original compositions. Does not have to correlate to brony or pony themes in the slightest.

Sweetiebelle's voice o_O
08,14The clencher, copyrighted music is a no-go for the 24/7 stream. That said, during live-shows/DJ events copyright music will be played during request shows, genre shows, etc.

08,14Ghosties, there ist no way possible NOT to, especially taking requests from people. If they request a Daft Punk song, they get a Daft Punk song.
i gonna cry stop it :'(

gah, I can't get stream. mips.tv won' load for some reason.
I sense that you don't want us to get pounded by a music or record label.
;(
yeah
So many tears...
mips is having issues atm
I'm drowning
what's happening?
Hmm....
Help, my face is soaked
With all of the crap going on lately, I guess you have a valid concern.

Wonder when it'll be fixed.

Yes

RAWRity: Idon't think so

04Your Spidey sense is correct

im going to be honest, i was sent here to troll, but i have no clue how to go about it.

Well, if you leave and come back, it goes down. Not sure why.
20 mins to go. Still need the stream.

And me.

If you're watching now, and you leave, then come back, you'll lose it.
Pip: then BE GONE! you have failed in that regard!

So if you have the stream, don't leave the page.
08,14With this new setup also, I am taking that into account as the only time it will be heard is during live-shows/requests.
OKAY! Who does NOT have a stream? Say NEIGH! no allcaps
Y so serious?

Why so serious
:(

hey SlurryMoon
F5?
04Firstly, I drafted up a sheet for the admins to go by in the case of mod infractions. That is, if one of you violates any of these rules, there will be consequences. This is just standard protocol, it's a way for us to monitor ourselves
PLEASE PLAY LUNA REMIX ALEX.S VS EUROBEAT BRONY PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!
depy animeXD
I'm back :)
f5 is refresh yes
yes it is
and I come to find derpy

10,02What's the issue with the stream?
Dashie_Dashie: Love you <3
04Any questions or comments about the infractions?
Now I have... something.
spam*
:>
<3
What issue, superbrony? All of us can see it fine.
There seems to be a problem for some people with mips
It's just having some limited connection issues, SuperBrony.
Dashie_Dashie is loved...by NO PONY
:D
when will the stream fix?
:c
Sucks to be her
Who is this guy http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/ef339f04-94af-4e7a-8d17-64b124dcc56f.png
It's an easy fix, you just have to have everyone keep refreshing until they can reach it.
=P
13question: is everyone held to the same standard, mods and admins alike?
Dashie_Dashie is loved by everypony including myself >.>
:| The Great and Powerful trixie agrees with your otherwise pointless statement
sonic + lag = wth
Dende? you srs dood?
And it's lagging.
the best namekian ever
/me wubs Dashie_Dashie
04Admins are a bit different, I haven't drafted up anything for that yet
Evening bronies :)
04But I understand your concern
Haey
Hai Combustiblelemons
04And I've been looking into it
Howdy.
Pinkie pie as captain ok we've doomed
still nothing. :[ fuck this, im switching to firefox
/me wubs Dashie_Dashie too
8 minutes until Euro Stream ^.^
@radu isnt the derpy voiceactress the same as rarity?
is anyone's stream working?
This is srs bns bro
it's still not working :'(
looks like I jumped in just in time.
04I would expect something by BS 2.0
Combustible.
The new episode won't buffer on youtube, has it streamed here already?
mine isn't either, it's not found
04But that's kind of a very rough date
ICE is now canon in MLP
stream y u hate me ; ;
yes?
/me wubwubwubwubwubwubwub's everypony
0,5I have a question: When it says "if a moderator has zero strikes and misses a new FiM ep without giving a typed notice to admins" does this mean we miss a Saturday stream and we dont say anything?
Eeyup she is Hawkylol
Just refresh it enough times. It eventually'll pop up
yes
time to switch to chrome
Keep hitting F5 every time the stream doesn't come through.
Stream is working perfectly for me
i'm on firefox same error here :p
You'll get it eventually.
trying router reset
00,06Yes.
4 hours ago
ok thanks :)
?
04If you miss the ep without saying anything to the admins, then yes
xD
No problem.
^.^
It's apparently not a browser thing, then.
Commence f5 rape
Nope.
WTF?!?!?! Even firefox isn't working! :[
I'm on Firefox.
0,5Because if something comes up in real life on a Saturday morning or something, what if someone cant get onto their computer to tell the admins?
keep..
looks like still nope
Grumpy
refreshing.
I'm on firefox. it came up eventually. Think it's mips
A stream is in 6 minutes according to the banner up there
04We have an away topic on the mod forum for you to put up in the case something happens
Keep hitting f5
it works, trust me.
inb4 more ragequitting on stream
Until it works.
:D
00,10It's all mips side guys
Yeah, the streams are s:[t tonight
04In that case, then get on Skype and alert us
hey everyone
thats the replay
04It's much quicker
00,10browser has no effect
What Sumica said.
are you still getting the error or right side blank?
yay~
woo, 1080p version is already on youtube
Mips.tv is having limited connection issues everyone.
yay
Thats all.
=P
All dat RAGE
Kk
:|
there we go
Just keep refreshing and wait everytime.
it works
sup
mfw so many mods
TRUST ME>
hi
04If you can't get to your computer then send a text to one of the admins
0,5What I mean is no computer access, something came up, folks are making you leave the house scenario.
I had the same problem.
Hi
also pinkie is best pony
00,10that said dont refresh page and your fine
hi
04Preferably by cell phone
Of course she is!
00,10if you already can see it it will keep up
05,15What if we don't have a cell phone...
mkjl;
lmao.
All you have to do is keep pressing F5 or refresh your page until you see the stream. If you can see it now. Do NOT leave the page, unless you want to lose it.
00,06x.x;
Rofl
lmao
yeah
much better
0,5I assume the admins' cell numbers can be found somewhere
this is the best song evar
0,5?
yes, yes, yes! it's working <3
Mine came back
Oh my.
There are people without mobiles? :o
Interesting video...
we pone now
just rewatching the ending of the new episode on YT, love AJ's face at the end during the "Letter"
and now you can watch CoD
04Then talk to us when you return and we will converse
but it keeps buffering at intervals
but whos worst pony?
mfw "you is"
Just in time, this is probably contested with making my day
Nopony is worst pony
:P
00,06Not currently, no, though we may put them somewhere in the future if necessary.
04But don't expect us to dismiss it entirely
I was on the steam earlier
thats not nice
Hi everypony. Did the stream box get moved?
and this other song came up
13point of note: google voice and by extension texts through google voice is still free as far as i'm aware
No spoilers for todays episode please!
Nopony is a very kind pony
im watching silly pony
anyone know what it's called?
04As I said, if you have ANYWAY of contacting us then please do so
there are some who haven't seen it yet.
13international may be different
Mm
Anyone home? no? ok then.
Derpy is also a silly pony.
with an unfortunate name
04And yes, google voice is free in the US
no cod for me
This is the Late Euro Strsam for anyone who has already seen it.
It's basically a song about the internet
it starts of as Nyan cat
My list is Pinkie, Twilight, AJ, Fluttershy, Rarity, RD
nooo it's still not working
Allow people to view it on their own ^.^
Imma not Spoiling anything
We'll need quite a few. If we get sick for instance, or a sudden family emergency.
hm
0,5I'll need to get a cell number soon, just in case something happens one sat. morning or friday night.
I just notice something in the new episode, some ponies were walking on their hind leg
that's strange
It's outliers.
wehres derpy?
10,02Someone needs to swap the stream embed as MIPS is having technical issues.
Don't worry, I won't mention this episode
Ofthe mane six
yeah now its pink party
EVERYONE
ah
Ponies only have one hind leg Dken2021?
04For those of you in the US, I suggest Google Voice
haha
that's very strange
This videos makes me sh*t rainbows.
But should we share cell numbers then. That might be personal.
O_o
3 minutes until Euro Stream of the New Episode ^.^
hind legs
^_^
04It's free and it gives you a number to call and text from if you don't have a cell
huh
Pinkie pie's jump makes light wish it was faster
I'm gonna miss the euro stream:'(
Spoiler: Ponies do stuff
lawl
Wow...What a shock Kira..
so many pinkie pies
Spoiler: NO SPOILERS!
Kira_Pony_Yamato: That spoiled everything!!
kiraXD
8,1i think a scenario where an episode streaming mod is unable to stream or contact the admins is very unlikely, but i'd expect that if there was a really *really* good reason for it, there wouldn't be any major repurcussions
Sorry, couldn't resist. LOL
Pinkie pie is the internet.
2 minutes
YOU B:[ARD!
You gotta share! You gotta Care...
2 minutes everypony
my stream connection is keeping resetting! : /
My Apple Bloom fell off the desk

My car does not.

I have aerodynamic eyes :3
Me too, it's printed "Snape kills Dumbledore" on the back
04If there's absolutely no way for you to reach us about it, then we'll talk when you return

Refresh your page until you can watch the stream.
My car has ative aerodynamics
answer this person
Make sure you don't leave, however.

I'm refreshing now, considering there's about a minute till
Cypresswolf: Refresh, wait, if it doesn't show, repeat.

spam
Noooo! So close!
Aww...
Lucky you.
lol
Can't count down.
=(
04Any kind of excessiveness is abuse of power
did we switch over to LS yet?
anyone?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the infraction you're referring to is more along the lines of the LotR night of nicks and RP, correct? As opposed to a simple nickchange
ignition 5..4..3..2..1..
04So kickspamming would be, yes
10,02Please hang on everypony, we are working on swapping the stream embed
guuuuys i want stream! : /
stream just froze...
I was volunteering and working on deferred payment, otherwise.
the stream wont load!
no I missed it

DOOGIES!
So. What are we watching?
04The biggest reason why it's included is so the users and admins know who we're talking to
The deferred payment is probably not haappening, my boss probably just wasted her money anyway.

04The next topic is one that will be sure to make some of you happy, and some of you cringe

00,10you are on the wrong one then
04BronyState is doing an official rating shift
Lolwat ^
=P nothing is playing at the moment haha.
00,10make sure you can see the stream too SB
oopse
ohhh cmon guys fix it! :(

Lol
I knew I shouldn't have switched my ISP to Derpynet
lol

Dear Celestia, I DIDN'T LEARN ANYTHING!
00,10Relax herostar

No...spoilers..

http://i.imgur.com/hJLxA.jpg
/me is jelly that the Eurostream viewers doesn't have to experience the horro of watching Epic Movie :|
04Note that this does not mean that we'll allow porn or gore
00,10PINKIEPIEROCKS refresh page
We don't? score.
horror*
Lol.
I dont see it. Do i hav to download somthing? If so, is it compatible with ubuntu
she'd banish you to the moon for not putting her title at the beginning IsABrony
04But content will not be filtered so much
Really?
how X(
yay :)
10,02Alright, fixing the stream.
yay I fixed it
Wait, has Epic Movie been banned?
Refresh, then?
My internet crashed during Alice, so I didn't get to see Epic Movie, luckily
LordCelestia yes
04As such, I ask that the mods change behavior accordingly in the chat
Epic Move got the WMC but I didn't know that came into effect between showings.
oh wait
dear princess celestia: i learnt ponies can be impatient while the mods fix the livestream.
00,10Yes epicmovie got WMC'ed
I went to bed before epic movie, my lungs were huring >.>
04"Naughty" words are okay
hurting*
04As long as they aren't used offensively
/me pokes the sleepy ponies with a herring
aww :(
So, epic's out.. what are we watching?
Dashie_Dashie you lucky bastard
/me hugs dashie
:|
WMC?
Um, not a lot is happening for me, is it supposed to be streaming yet?
Besides the blank player screen.
04However, words like "nigger" is still kick/ban material
Worst Movie Clause. For the films that are just so damn awful.
Haha.
Not yet.
They're workin' on it.
how the hay do i refresh
f5
ah.
Got up at 6am just for ponies though.
gwas
i was out with some friends that night :/ was epic movie really that bad?
Great, that moment when you think you're missing the opening gag.
So we're skipping Epic Movie entirely?
It means they can never be shown again.
hey guys
10,02Alright, stream is back up.
Foreeeveer
I'm waiting, I'm waiting
Ew, I hate that
yes Combustiblelemons it was that bad.
hey
Yay! Thank you.
and it loads loads loads,the ring of streaming,the ring of streaming
I-I got signal?
10,02Now going to start! Let me know if you see video.
Superbrony just said it should be back up.
FINALLY
04If the user is coming into the chat with intent to harm or insult others then you may use your power, of course, like always
What's tonight's B movie, if any, then?
Nothings playing for me...
competing with babes in toyland bad?
8,1what about exclamations like "cunting cockfathoms"? in all seriousness, are we going to have a defined list of words that are kickable?
same
what is your favorite pony?
04But swearing shouldn't be a problem unless spammed
YAY I SEE IT
SuperBrony64 Nope nothing yet
I press play, then it goes back to it's paused position.
/me just refreshed, and nothing is on the stream
Nothing competes with BIT Combustiblelemons. Nothing.
no stream
Chat isn't as lively as it was when Derpy talked lol
Don't F:[kthis up for me! I NEED my Cupcake Money!
shouls I rfresh again?
wait until he says to play
server not found
04If it's a one time thing, then no
But I want it nao =(
*ding* Done!
it just loading now in my screen
Ah. Gotcha.
/me pointing out obvious
refreshed, and still no stream here either
This is the second showing, for one.
nothings playing
04If it becomes spammable and a constant thing, then you should take action
Nothing playing
still loading then play symbol come up
I imagine that's what caused the leak in the internet we've been seeing...
wait until SB says it's ok to play
spiders web is a close one meanwhile
Hmm..
>.> nothing will show
there were like 6000 people watching the new episode this morning. I dunno what the norm is.
i got nothing :'(
Right
I don't think anything is supposed to be playing, yet :/
allit does is want to load. It say that the video is only 0:00 minutes long, and I dont even see the picture!
ok guys now everybody knows it
lol
favorite pony - Do I have to pick just 1? - Roseluck, Applejack, Spitfire are in the running for #1 to me
Well, remember, this is the Euro stream.
So.
that movie made me want to burn every copy of it in existance
Spiders web was depressing Combustiblelemons, but BIT was bad, unfathomably long, and made me leak blood my from my eyes.
Eeyup.
XD
what is the next episodes name btw
pick as many as you like, but it has to be in X is best pony forum
Cypresswolf not particularly, my favorite is all of them
thanks to ponibooru I have a new BG-Pony I love.
I wanted to call FPSRussia so he could shoot the living s:[t out of it
when can i press the little play button?
I'm not really familliar with TV-14, what sort of things would it actually mean, would it mean any major changes (we already allow swearing that isn't excessive)?
...Tag. You're it.
We'll find out.
=P
The singla moves at lightspeed though, and at that speed, you can circle the earth 7 times in one seconds...
wait for it
Next week's MLP episode, Hawkylol? It's "Read it and Weep".
singal*
Yay, My stream is back!
:P
Mm.
Who's that, Archer?
signal?
it's not usually like this pinkiepierocks
!cd
Episode 16 of season 2 "Read It and Weep" airs in 6 days, 19 hours, 48 minutes, 15 seconds (Feb 04 2012 15:00:00 GMT)
10,02The movie should be playing.
bored... bored....bored....
technical difficulties tonight
Not for me =/
nope
Yeah, if there is one cable.
its not
nothing
:O rd is in trouble!
as in the data for the stream
05,15Here's what the content ratings mean http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Parental_Guidelines
so I need to clear my cache and restart?
it's not
i dont see anything, bros
04Movies that have nudity would be okay, videos with it would be alright. Again, as long as it's not porn
I just see Applejack
00,10SB are you checking to stream to see if you can see video?
do you have the wrong stream?
<-- presses play and it just goes back to paused
Was making sure that's what you were trying to spell =P
i cannot see
got nothing my end, just pauses again
ikr
same dashie
Has the stream started yet?
mine to
The number of cables wouldn't make the singal go any slower or faster
Same
same
Guys, don't spam about your personal problem. =P
same
Don't think so.
Its the same for just about everyone.
Ok, thanks.
Nnope.
just have fun and talk for a bit bronies ^_+^
does google chrome might be the problem?
currently im seeing LimeV, with nothing on it
oh dear
Okay
Exactly.
^__^*
This sucks
Will this change how we deal with images?
Guys, just relax.
UGH
Cavy: well it's not personnal if we all have it, is it?
What stupid pony things did you do today?
It'll be on shortly.
oops
poor Eurostream is experiencing some technical diffculties
using opera
indeed, it does
04And that content ratings page would be decent to go by
Other than chat with bronies
Are you sure you're connected to the right address SB?
Not for me. I have cupcakes.
Ponies lose their mind without video stimuli.
...
i acidentaly my computer there for a min
my first day ever on this site and its "bad"
04As for images, your judgment as a moderator is still your best tool
If anyone here is famalier with Nostalgia Critic and his website, There is a "Bad Movie Beatdown" review of Epic Movie. I don't think it gets the beating it deserves but I digress
I ate a muffin today if that counts as pony related.
Herostar: Fair enough, that was the point however.
I Going to play xbox/ps3 now, but im not leaving the stream, because im a dedicated brony.
Placebo ikr?
<-- serious
So, Ponies. Rad, or super rad?
RD cupcakes?
This isn't working.
ultra rad
First world problems huh PINKIEPIEROCKS
04If it's outright explicit, then do whatever you think is necessary to punish the offender
It's not usually this bad, PINKIEPIEROCKS. Just, well, about half the time.
ARGH
PINKIEPIEROCKS: give it a chance
XD
it's not usually like this right?
Ponies are off the rad-meter
Guys.
mega rad
Meanwhile: It's the worst. possible. thing.
10,02Let me try again
As in icing and cake in a small paper cup.
Darn. I guess I'll have to keep watching Dan Vs.
They banned discussion of that Fic here.
=P
Cavy: sup?
10,02Please relax, we're working on a solution
04But suggestive images shouldn't be too bad
8,1what about violence and gore, e.g.: http://du.cx/1hR (not excessive, some blood)
orly?
xD
They did?
04Blood would be fine
is dan vs any good?
Im gonna listen to the Flim Flam Bros song again
Ah, I keep forgetting about that.
Practically.
Thank Celestia
04But not excessive
Haha
In no way is it usually like this. Tragically there is something wrong at this point in time and we're all just unlucky.
05,15Can we get an example of a pic that would normally be banned, but is now okay?
SuperBrony64 do your thing
04We're not aiming for TV-MA
Let us never speak of this again.
^
I hate that story.
lol
it just exited me out of bronystae -.-
spah sappin mah bronystate
With a passion.
Example
lol
One bad fanfic and we're branded for life.
pinkiepie cannons! AIM AT THE STREAM! :O
I'm not complaining at all, I just state whats going wrong on my end.
I'll be back later then, just going to watch some anime while you work your magic superbrony64
it aint working
Sit back, relax, and try not to freak out.
:p
my pci usb card dicided it was gona try being hot swapable
Mainly because of my fanboy nature towards Rainbow Dash
It was semseless lood and gre, nothing more
But.
How long till the stream starts up
give it time people!
:P
:O
:|
Y'know.
and looking forward to the remixes....oh I cant tell you how excited I am about them remixes :)
/me continues to nom SuperBrony64's interweb tubes
whatever you do though, don't cross the streams...
yes
i founded it quite enjoyable :3
It's Discord's fault :x
kirzstryfe is Pumpkin Cake.
Ponymeister95: They're working on it.
:O:O:O
Well, it should be up now, but..
http://ih0.redbubble.net/work.7578596.2.flat,550x550,075,f.keep-calm-and-watch-ponies-poster.jpg
ACTA did it
oh
it's gozer's fault
watch the batter turn to matter, open the portal and jump in
its not like we start watching in the 10th minute guys
ah, problem identified. Discord crossed the streams >.>
Theres some technical difficulties. No worries, it should be on shortly.
:| cmon you stupid internet
advice we can all follow.
/me leans back and relaxes while waiting for ponies
How about My Little Dashie?
Probably not appropriate Combustiblelemons since the stream is, you know, goofed.
T_T
Anyone excited about next weeks episode, if you already have seen this one?
THAT
after pñaying dead space 1 , 2 that fanfic was so childs play
we can talk about.
well thats what youtube is for
I can't wait for the 11th.
04Looking for one now
I loved that story.
4th is my date...
mare-a-thon followed up by a possibility of Big Mac having more than one line? squee.
this is my first day ever on dis site and it ruined :'(:'(
are there youtube links?
I am not doing a round of dinging for everyone too busy on youtube.
I took off of work for it.
im starting to wanna R@G3 :[
LOL
I have one, but I can't find it.
funny thing, this is the first time I've ever tried to watch an episode by stream xD
well don't
PINKIEPIEROCKS: it's not always like this -_-
I was one posted yesterday in chat.
*no regrets
That poster lacks ponies and to bright
I heard it was touching, I need to read it ;u;
there gonna be a youtube vid in,lemme guess,2 hours?
:(
04Actually, like say a pony that's been humanfied or whatever that's in a bikini
Hearts and Hooves is gonna be AWESOME!
8,1Ghosties: correct me if i'm wrong, but would a good example of what's allowed now in terms of sexual pics be Ask Princess Molestia, but nothing more explicit than that?
/me noms on Lasharus
<--- my background for my computer.
http://i.imgur.com/9h7ju.jpg
Equestria Daily for your pony news, fan creations, and episode links.
Shii
Hawkylol: there already is
8,1or is that too high a level?
You should.
read and weep will be awesome
It's a good read. Decent length. Set aside an hour or two for it.
04Can't be too suggestive
Many cried.
04Not too much detail
04For example
nice, Dashie
Oh, what do you think of Cherimac or whatever the ship is now called?
for the new ep at least
Daft, I'm so excited for that one.
dat RD Dashie_Dashie
<3 Dashie
me too!!!
Another Dash episode? Pretty sweet.
/me puts on the boot Jim gave him earlier
:)
i hav nothing at all on my sc- never mind :D
04The Luna picture that shows the outline of her vulva would be considered kick/bannable
The canon cannon will blow away all Mac ships. LOL
I WILL READ IT.
wheres newDCD with a shoe on his head?
i took the test and im dash!!!
win background
here it goes
YAY!!!
that's what we need
is there no stream `?
/me points out that those boots were made for walking
What test
i have something on my screen but nothing on my stream
0.0
I'll keep you all entertained with my old pony folders.
I'm guessing some personality quiz.
I kicked for that yesterday.
I'd assume so.
I'm AJ. I thought I'd be Pinkie. Lol.
eeyup
/me gets a sad face "wats wrong with the stream? did ACTA get to it :(?"
One of 500 pony personality tests I'm betting have popped up.
i'm watching friendship is witchcraft, while i'm waiting :p
mine is loading .-.
lmao.
04Eh, cupcakes is still pretty iffy
oh god what's that ringing outside my house!?
i thought i was going to be AJ
I got Pinkie:O:O
http://imgur.com/OCkrk
i blame SOPA
It's not cupcakes.
i got no fluttershy
Just slight grimdark.
I do too
lol
dat Molestia
otakon:why?is the episode over and smb. recoreded it yet?
Point and case.
Seems legit.
WHY SOPA WHHHHHYYYYY
mygod... i forgot acta... MESSAGE ALL GAME SITES TELL EM TO PROTEST
I'd say mention if Cupcakes is fine, but any in depth description of events that take place are still too far.
easy with the all caps
of*
04Any reference to the story itself would be punishable because of its high gore content
Hawkylol: yeah, it's up on youtube
actually sopa got shelved
not allcaps now is it?
Hmm I find this lack of ponies...disturbing.
Agreed.
they have to make a derpy episode ASAP
its ACTA that is the big thing now :/
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/6c993302-f0ae-45b8-9beb-272b39a2533d.jpg xD
so,why are all the people here? _D
04But I say that images, as long as they're not too graphic, would be fine
:O
MonoRail!!!
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-rise-of-the-gluten.gif
The internet would explode
d'aww
do you guys wanna help stop acta?
04So that one there would be alright in my eyes
http://www.avaaz.org/en/eu_save_the_internet_spread/?coXwGcb
read the rules it clearly states no ALL CAPS
hahahha
do we need to add rainbow factory to the list with cupcakes?
lol scoot
05,15No outside links!
Nah, next big leap is a song between derpy and Lyra.
If you're just killing time, check this out, if you haven't seen it.
Hawkylol: for the euromovie stream and the reshowing of today's ep
or at least a trixie ep
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDMGv3hNMes
Where the hell did the marshmellow meme start?
The internet exploded already xD
oh, srry :(
I've had it looping for about 3 days.
OK NOT ALL CAPs
/me hangs had in shame
04I've never read Rainbow Factory. Give me a content description
head*
05,15PINKIEPIEROCKS watch it
8,1kirzstryfe: i think Rainbow Factory is implicitly on the list, due to gore
rarity resembles a marshmellow in one episode
http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=vXgFZgnivXs check it out!
ACTA will get stopped but when no one expects it
onoz, not safe for woona!
Oh my god I love that.
It's not as bad as Cupcakes.
:O
dumb rock!
8,1it's certainly higher than TV-14
0,5I heard its bad
04If there's explicit gore, then it's not for us
04No gore, no porn
Bunny.
otakon: i thought its a livestream from the us tv :D
Supports this
here we go
Lol. Seen the original?
Dashie_Dashie it was in the diamond dogs ep
found it ^_^
04Suggestive is okay, but nothing explicit
http://images.memegenerator.net/instances/250x250/9125733.jpg
Oh I seee
8,1gore bad, blood permissable?
some bronystate history there
hi guys
yup hahaha
Dashie_Dashie: when Rarity is crying after being called a mule by the Diamond Dogs, she grabs the camera. For a moment, you hear her limbs "squeak" and her front legs look like marshmellows.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3WrERClYcc
04Yes, but too much blood
watch this!!!
hi guys :3
well she does look marshmelloy

possibly.
no one wants to nom on me...
>.>
No non image links.
<.<
10,02Please clear your cache otherwise.
to liveV?
04There's no mutilation in there, it's strictly suggestive
That's as bad as RBD presents cupcakes gets.

Superbrony told everyone to refresh..
Here's to hoping.
her wing is cut off...
Tih isn't working.

No worries though

Praise be to the internet!
Great. CoD. I prefered a blank video.

:)
Okay, working. And it's some game or other.
10,02If it's Livestream, please follow my instructions.
8,1also, i disagree with you on the "suck my dick" pic; that wouldn't be allowed in a TV-14 item like Family Guy, though "go down on you" would
Well...it's something.
i got livestream now
that happens to be disconnected from her body?
I cna see cod now
Yea, me too
this looks like...an interesting film
^_^
Well, I see livestream.

GENTELMEN BEHOLD.

or at least signal..
Are you watching COD, Kira?
Suddenly, SB's belly button.
0.0
Have it up?
What I got is livestream...

RBD Presents Cupcakes doesn't get that bad. Nowhere in the territory of the fanfic. In fact, it's a comedy.
10,02EmeraldChocolate: Nope, it's playing right now.
Wario
Huh...
Wait what?
Weird...
i see a pony-nelly
Or rather, Lyrical trivia?

OK.
huh, froze
0,5I assume to still be on the lookout if anyone posts suggestive things
Hawkylol: New pony episodes are on saturdays.
/me hugs otakon
time?
Meanwhile: well, it's rather lazy to recycle a score like that, especially for a multi-million dollar movie production.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/1608cf60-4bf3-48e3-a460-5456d3416243.png XD
Suggestive in what way?
SB, are picture links allowed during the stream?
Alice?
RAWRity: no one cares.
/me eats some of TheGreatAndPowerfulT's popcorn
same time as today Hawkylol
i'm curious.
it's the new episode are you bucking me?

it's alice
1,3For any new ponies, make sure you read our rules at www.bronystate.net/rules
00,10Correct Meanwhile no epic movie
10,02Picture links are allowed as long as they follow our rules.
?
Sumica: so what are we watching instead? Or is that a surprise?
possible.
got'cha SB :3
"What's this I hear?...What wondrous thing? Is this what they call... extasy? A flashing liiiight, above the door... There's just one thing it could mean... war."
it's a surprise!
04Sexual = bikinis and the like are fine, but no clear outlines of nipples, clits, or vulvas. Nothing too suggestive like hornjobs either
do not want. coming back later for episode
00,10That I dont know
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/14abc7f0-070f-4b6b-9999-1bca723c4cbb.gif

Well ok then. Should be fun.
04Violence = Just no explicit gore

Foreeeveeer
00,10more like supprise it's g3.5
It's always quiet during euro stream tbh.

The picture keeps freezing
/me clings onto Dken2021 man

inb4 new B movie is Disaster Movie/Meet The Spartans/Vampires Suck megacast.
04I'd allow it
I haven't done anything.
00,10SB likes to show the new eps at the end of the euro show for those of you taht missed it this morning.
everyone's een the animated version
Not yet.
With You, Friends makes me think of ponys... from skrillex
:o
Why is every hamish ginger?
New B movie must be Super Mario Brothers
What about Vore?
invigorating, yeeeeees
8,1that is terrifying
mine keeps freezing :|
Vampire Suck was awesome.
0,5What if said maid is showing off the rear or something? It varies.
it is about 10 years old by now
LOL
oh my, movie's started. Refresh if you cant see anything
Btw, can somepony explain how a movie can be removed for the eurostream, like epic movie this time?
/me answers his phone. "Yes." Thanks for calling EmeraldChocolate.

We've already shown Super Mario Brothers live action movie.

TRUST THE FUNGUS!
god, that face screams for a fist
why does hamish look like he's about to spit on everyone?
Anyone notice this movie is about an Acid Trip?
Is there a person alive who hasn't seen the animated classic?
i love the new album
=P
alice is a vampire :)
hah :D
Kencolt: many.
Kencolt: which movie?
especially summit
Vore?
04It's all on your judgement. All I can do is try to provide the guidelines
o boy :)
For two hours last night, Cavy.
8,1eating fetish
I haven't seen most of the disney animeated movies
8,1eating alive, i mean
it has to be incredibly awful to watch
WMC
These people are SO pale.
good question
but turn into a good movie
we should be watching ponies not alice's
8,1like, being eaten
Ets funny to me
Something along the lines of "Worst Movie Clause", if it's voted so terrible that it's banished to the moon
Flying isn't impossible....
Worst Movie Clause.
LOL They are
Oh.
/me 8,1has suddenly become ineloquent
05,15that would fall under gore wouldn't it?
If a movie is so bloody awful
The FIRST Disney stab at Alice in Wonderland.
/me puts down phone
WHY Y FREEZE gosh
I wonder about flying all the time
Flying is actually quite easy.
not happening
0,5Ew... vore....
The mods have it removed from all future events.
08,14Alright . . Alright. . . We move on a bit? We can argue about what is good, or what is not.
you're pregnant
its freezing from your end
Eeyup
Bottom line
Wait... Epic Movie was removed?
<aviation major
WHY U FREEZE SO MUCH gooooosh
Use your own judgement.
trolls
PAH!
So... you actually... finished watching the movie yesterday?
Cool
it's running fine for everyone else
i knew it!
PINKIEPIEROCKS: refresh again, and calm down
But remember we'll be on TV-14
blackmaaaaail
trolls in your internet.
That makes a total of 3 movies under the WMC.
I wasn't here
*snrk* blackmail
00,10PINKIEPIEROCKS you need to relax
a contest so sound as alike as possible.
alice: madness returns is better!
Dat Blackmail
I came in last minute
i cant even fly a jet in BF3
So what will we watch in its place?
:(
i refreshed...
04May I move on?
07,01Alright Ghost next item
No one seems to know.
LOL
it dies?
Hm...
I guess the second pony ep?
It always freezes when someone is pulling a funny face for me....
Lord gingie.
04Alright
@ nose blow, not BF3 failures.
My bro flew once... the tredmill went to fast
8,1maybe use the Family Guy rule: if it wouldn't seem out of place in Family Guy, it's TV-14
he has a big nose
actually, I have a LOT oflagging and freezing.
20 years of age isnt so bad
lol
still freezy
but 15 is great
getting a tad laggy on my end too
the only kills i get with a jet is when i crash on someone
ya
It'll be a movie of some description probably.
Yeah he flew backwards, was weird. He cried. Lol...
04This last topic brings me to my current topic: Overzealousness
I'm having occational lags, but it's not very bad
back then 20 was middle aged
anyone here
in cases like this, they should do a small lottery for 3 pony eps :p
/me cracks fingers. I think its time I take matters in my own hooves
lol
04And what I mean is being so quick to ban
Shii: Should have put it on youtube.
the lady is 50
04Or kick
i just fill the jet with c4's
you'd be lucky to live past 40 in victorian era
mine lages every 5 secs
rabbit
you are now a baby-pooper, deal with it
A Wait... fingers and hooves? What manner of creature am I agaiN?
fingers = hooves. wha?
so cute
Alice in Lagland
>crack fingers
Damn shapeshifting magic
Pretty sure c4 is already plural.. I think.
o.o
ghastly lag
>hoffs
10,02Sometimes the video lags due to me switching applications in the background. My computer is as powerful as computers you find today.
Mm haha.
04It seems the chat thinks that we're becoming too uptight
/me twiddles his moustache.
Rabbits are awesome
>legit
Confuses the heck out of me

LOL
alice has ADHD
silly cgi bunny
:P
alice in lag-land BIGTIMSE
alice is on speed
that explains it
-.-
:D
Imogen Heap is her aunt?
you mad alice?
04What I'm suggesting is not lower your awareness or your judgment, but have patience and think your actions through
yay popcorn!
ew she ugly
Aunt Imogen Deep
Oh man your right! Well, my couz could've, this was like 5 years ago... lol how do I remember that.
@SuperBrony64, put on alice pwease? :'(

04Since we are moving to TV-14, you will have to change your modding behavior and I hope it won't be too difficult for all of you
I return! with a toasted cheese sammich!
LOLOLOL
/me drinks a mug of Apple Cider.
Maybe discuss a little first in Skype mod chat before taking action?
YUS SONIC
I can't see the stream :'(
I love sonic.
04^That could work
True fact, streams will sometimes lag. You must clench your jaw and soldier through that fact.
Scary but fun.
f5 i suppose
Now off to the movies I shall, go and I learn everything we should know since not knowing what the second movie is... is bad!
haha
Has anyone ever heard of a pony comic called "The Royal Guard"
Scary butt fun
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.
04And again, the guidelines I set in the last topic should help you know what's permissable and what's punishable
I do not know why to sing.
Tried that. I'll try again.
Don't believe so.
There wouldn't be a world without lag, sadly enough.
Imma play sonic nao
But rhyming seems is my thing
nope
there will always be lag ._.
"The New Royal Guard" I mean. Derp.
10,02It is on, make sure your stream embed is LimeV. If it is, clear your cache as we are using a separate embed info for LimeV.
it's supposed to be on LiveV now
Thank god I didn't actually dring any alcohol to~day

Spike: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
suprise buttsecks

Johnny Depp is so sexy he can play whatever he wants.
This is a "Oh No Not Again" moment.
and Sweeny Todd

sleep depravation
and the Tourist

what happened to wall of hands?
I want whatever she's smoking :D

She did Acid.

04Any questions?
no thats too hardcore dashie
and jack sparrow
hey everypony, I am playing xbox360 (could be playing ps3, but prefer xbox) and watching this at the same time! Does that make me a winner?

Screw gravity.
Isn't it beautiful?
HAX
alice, why you no die from that fall?!?
04When TV-14 goes into effect
lol
guys. we get it. we KNOW it's lagging for some.
JamesIsABrony sure, why not?
oh
damn you gravity
Sweeny Todd is definitely an A movie.
O_o I've always wondered how all that stuff just stays in mid air, and how she avoids hitting all of that in previous moive versions
At night!
pffft, screw gravity
If you fall up, just pick yourself down.
oh fuck you lag, fuck you
im going to dif room
rn u mad
Randomnerd: You're telling me, Sweeny Todd the demented murderer and man cooker is the same as Edward Scissorhands the aritifical man who wishes for nothing but to be helpful and belong?
20% cooler
0,5Question:
05,15Which is when bronystate 2.0 launches. correct?
0,14So would good practice in regards to warning/kicking, be asking the user to stop, giving them a second warning, and then kick if they still don't stop?
just in the case of a mis-kic/ban, make sure you talk to the person and explain the mistake
Ictiv, all your sarcasm aside, I really can't tell most of those guys apart.
Saw a shirt with Rainbow and that phrase at Hot Topic
rn looks like m XD

The room only affects what chat room you enter. It's the same stream for everyone./
0,14And secondly, how loose can we be with the no all caps rule?
ITIorons
0,5Ghosties, Once the forums become public, do the forum moderators have less responsibility for the IRC chat? In other words, should we pay as much attention to the IRC as much as we will need to for the forums?
i aint got no lag
<3
-.- i be TICKED OFF
(*-*)/)
If I took all the renditions of Alice in Wonderland, spliced scences that only appeared in 1 particular version, I wonder how that would turn out...
PinkiePieRocks, do you have a lot of extra connections open that would be lagging you?
Does Walmart sell pony stuff?
Random flask?
she's going to be late

why! why would you just randomly drink something like that...
Drink stuff you find in deep holes.
SUddenly, roofies.
but the other roles while LOOK similar, are completely different characters
i like her logic
It's only a dream. That's your excuse for everything.
Shii: Not the GOOD pony stuff.

/me who wants a hug?
Dashie: because why the hell not. Also, it said to drink it.
lolwut
rainbows are not know for there flavor
00,10just layback and think of france
Perhaps it'd be more fair to say that Johnny Depp has an annoying routine when he works with Tim Burton.
/me wants a hug

Episode 16 of season 2 "Read It and Weep" airs in 6 days, 19 hours, 18 minutes, 23 seconds (Feb 04 2012 15:00:00 GMT)
wait... how come her underwear shrank with her?
Tim Burton has an anoying routine when working with actors
04But if it's appropriate to whatever is on the stream, then I'd say it's okay
Oh, you can find it on youtube now
SATs = Dunskies! : D
This has Johnny Depp in it, rite?
there I fixed that for you
/me hugs Haku
yea
i was high when i saw this film
Alice, Knock the table over
yfw this is technically a sequel to the other Alice in wonderland.
lol
the lin is on the EqD
hes the mad hatter
00,10Amazon it will be showen again at the end of movie night
om nom nom nom
Dark_Horst: for decency's sake
04But as soon as it ends and they're still spamming, take action
I never saw it, wanted to though so now I can :D
the episode is up, in hi-def, on YT and EQD.
:o
oh*
Yet another blessing brought by being a brony.
My personal opinion is allcaps are fine so long as they aren't spammed by the same person for a lot of their messages.
I can live with that, as I said, I think Johnny Depp is great, and now I've figured out the pattern... it IS Burton.
RAWRity link me i missed it :p
but decency buttrapes logic
04But otherwise, allcaps is okay as long as they don't spam
lol
I want to meet the baker of those cakes
YAY
If you still want the chat up, click the pop up on the bottom of the page
Mind your head.
Sweet celestia, that's a lot of young girl.
is this Alice and Wonderland?
Pedobear approves.
i think that it is awesome how somone made a website where bronies can be bronies. I think that in itself gets an award
Eeyup
yea
(Sorry, am in regulars aswell)
and nudity ruins the rating :P
then go nto youtube
No this is The Prince and the Pauper.
shes not really a little girl in this
no, this is patrick
This movie is Tron.
Alice in Lag-land
I'm in... <insert all channels> :3
This is Vintage Inception.
no, THIS IS SPATA!!!
this movie is tron : P
It's from Sam & Max (new video game series) Season 1 episode 4 "Abe Lincoln must Die%"
I figured 16ish.
/me slaps [SWAG]Haku with a truck tire.
This is Tron, can't you see?
SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI
do you have battletoads?
If this is Tron, I'm Celestia
Science and stuff
:P
Discord's playground
have any of you guys seen the creepy russian alice in wonderland?
Awesome games
trippy
whimsy
wow, must have been some good acid...
I loved saying "This movie is Tron" in old 4chan streams i'd go too.
Nnope.
lol everytime when i want to say something somebody say it..
04LordCelestia: It would be advisable to spend some time in IRC once the forums are up because you will still be given a priviledge above the regular users (which is Voice), but again most of your time will be directed into the forums. So like 75% forums, 25% IRC
made me Lul.
i did
movie flaw #1: Her dress grows with her and shrinks back without tearing
nope
1,3Sam & Max is an old series, just with new games :p
its really creepy
If your Celestia, than I cal Luna
Johnny Depp as Discord
I saw the original version of this movie some years ago, when they put credits in the front of the movie.
I know
magic dress
the NC mentioned it once
For those lagging, clearing your cache again somehow worked for me...
04But for events, I'd suggest being there
Ok
Cypresswolf I think it's her corset
-.-
Without that flaw this film would have a much higher rating Cypresswolf.
Magic dress
also they have to keep it rated low
04And BMNs if you can
Don't try and apply logic to Alice in Wonderland.
Howdy Cavy.
rocking horsefly
its where wonderland is inside of a house
we missed 'cha.
as creepy as for epic movie
04It's more advisable for you to be there for events
it's trippy enough as it is
I meant the new video game series sicne they had a tv series as well so Season 1 Episode 4 could have been confusing
The earth is round, there is no up or down.
dormouse! *glomps*
ok, I can see that
Perfect logic
How are ya doing Placebo?
it's her corset, notice the dress fell in the room
afterall what fun is there in making sense?
Movie Flaw #1: Alice's actress is as wooden as Plank from Ed Edd N Eddy
Mallykun <3
lol
i wanna see 'the thing'
LOL RAWRity!
XD
Can't complain. Home for the weekend from college, homeworks done, now i'm just chillin' with bronies.
RAWRity: plank was a great actor.
Yep.
and together, they are the only gay in the village
Well, my labtop is about to die. Bye
Alice: Who are you if I might ass?
Wut?
anybody knows when is it going to be released in cinemas?
bye haku
Can't wait to watch everyone watch The new Pony episode.
theyre looking like the fat man from little brittan
Stump from Angry Beavers > Plank
That's an insult against the plank
plank was epic
bye Haku
0,5Always^
i loveded you all
04Also, one more small change: you should probably be a bit more lax on the banning starting now
More importantly, I'm already excited about next weekends episode.
andy pipkin :D
I've really, really liked the past few episodes.
but not upi Meanwhile
does bronynight theatre stream movies daily?
plank from EEnE was awesome
yahIknow
i bet that edds voice actor is in it
What's got you hyped up? Rainbow dash fanboy? xP
13o/
13voices could also watch chat and alert things to us, like the mod trials, even if they can't take action themselves
i liked baby cakes!
[SWAG]Haku: ;n;
Plank was the best character in Ed Edd n' Eddy
nuff said
is that a dodo?
angry beavers. man i havent heard that name in a long time
Yea.
You can learn alot of things from the flowers.....and Why are the Moamrats only shown in the animated disney versuion?
i watcehd it
same rainbow dash + books = LOLZ
Me too, though they say season 1 was better.
04Don't change over to TV-14 mod duty, but just be more lax now on chat
yeah
Amazon no only fridays and saturdays
Meanwhile you slapped me
BABY CAKES WAS MY FAV.
no Acron, it's a Giant Dodo
witha tire
I've always liked her. For quite a few reasons.
trippi
04And yes, LC
he controlled johnny without even saying anything
http://i42.tinypic.com/x52g3l.jpg I must always post this whenever we watch this movie.
ok
You deserved it [SWAG]Haku
/me now needs to register for bronystate to nominate The Tourist.
04Because events aren't an every week thing
drugz
still a dodo
No
the junkie caterpillar is 24/7 high
Cool, cool.
Is that Snape's voice?
Sunday- Thursday = typical brony nights.
a smoker? in disney?
04So we'd expect you to be there, if possible
Snape the catapiller
introducing the only actor in this movie who gives a flying fuck: Alan Rickman
Alan Rickman in a Tim Burton movie?
Ima about top leave any minute now
Mainly because I can relate. Another is the fact that she is often abused by the community.
Yup
:) i think everypony is best pony
Baby cakes sucked due to lack of Smile, Smile, Smile
im staying until i die
An elder scroll!
So would someone going "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" be ok but someone going "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" not be?
i think catdog should be in wonderland
Blasphemy.
i wionder what he put in his hooker
alan rickman caterpillar >.>
0,5(I wasnt asking, I was agreeing. Heheh)
or the labtop. Which ever comes first
It had "oink, oink, oink"
*hookah
arrowtothebroknee, alice has always been like this, regardless of producer.
lol
depends on the context
don't look at it, you'll go blind
Ie: being called a Lesbian, which, is only an issue because it's being used as an insult.
besides that, it was good
LOL
god, my brain is fucked tonight
it's not smoking. It's shisha ;p
that smoking catapillar is in every alice.
04Also depends on your judgment, as always
All-caps lines are common.
these are weird days
Caterpillar has a hookah.
04Like I said, just take a moment to think
04Don't react so quickly
high on opium
Lol. Fandom stereotypes.
OK.
Yep.
ah yes, that's the other name for it.
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
04This isn't a contest to see who can kick or ban first
vorpal sword is best sword
oh? I beg to differ..
Catapillar is a smoker
So, a nuclear bomb couldn't kill the dragon thing?
Oh, she has a Rainbow? She's automatically a Lesbian.
Spoiler Alert :P Thanks Tweedle Dee...or is it Tweedle Dum?
04Dari cut that out >:I
piggy pie was adorable
i saw an alice version with a caterpillar with a juicebox :)
professor junkipillar
It's an example.
the MASTER SWORD will do the job.
Rainbow Dash is straight, guys
d'aw
04I know
Thinking time may not exist during speed chat.
Don't forget the sportster attitude.
rrrrrape
04I wanted to be salty
They don't have nukes, it's the Victorian Era.
Ever heard of being a Tomboy who was born with Rainbow Attitude
Also when watching seven chat rooms.
i liked psycho twilight :)
exactly.
lol
I think that should be tested.
Lol!
/me gives the mathematician's answer.
A Rainbow Main =P
So lately, Ive been watching sooooooooo much dr who
they don't even have any missiles of any kind
its was so enjoyable
04For live new eps, then you should be on your most alert
Alice is hot in this movie
42?
=s
4x = 3.
alice: Y u no wake up
This ain't no dream.
dat needle.
04I wouldn't have problems with you reacting then
She just seems so young to me. Idk.
Dat helpful mouse.
x =3/4
Who? Alice?
lol
yeah
ONO
Well, they have missiles, thats anything that flies, lol
13but during speed chat there's generally not much thinking going on anyways, i would suggest keeping an eye out more for single people causing trouble, rather than general spam
baaandersnatch!
run away!
thta's big doggy
Yeah? She looks like she's 15.
Time travel and bring a bomb with you then detonate, simply
RUN AWAY FROM THE KITTY
Bandersnatches, man.
Mm

True.

04But for weekdays and BMNs, just be patient and think your actions through
I just realised I called it a main.
Anyone not seeing the stream?

04I'm just kidding

These card soldiers > all others.

13banned-ersnatch?
It's Time to duel!
^
Shizuka: lol
True.
No no, Bandersnatch.
banned her-... nevermind
That.
As if they have dentists.
d-d-d-d-d-duel!
well that was a fantastic new episode
04We're all human, we're all going to make mistakes so I won't be surprised if something slips by
Ponymeister95: Is that name referring to Gundam 00?
d-d-d-d-d-d-d-DUEL.
Quill_Buckthorn: thats just wrong
mouse version of kratos?
OW
ewwwww
Yoink
OK.
OH GOD

hehe
too bad youguys are still. stuck. here.
No.
Dragonborn Shout!
Pff...Kratos.
Oink oink oink
i summon the dark magician and the dark magicain with big boobies!
really, my biggest problem with this movie is the visuals. You have wonderland, a bright, vibrantland filled with all types of colorful creatures and scenery, but everything is muted and tinted with grey. The Real Life segments had more vibrancy than wonderland!
*barf*
HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK?
I'm stealin' yo eye.
Believe in the heart of the cards
i remember this part :)
I call it being Dante.
04Don't be afraid to ask other mods in Skype
says ponies top priority
mally-kun
Oh god...
hello everypony!
Graphics of this movie are... different

OH JEEBUS
kidney punch
Pirate knight?
sorry allways wanted to say that
well kratos was always ripping a cyclops eyes out in gow3
Hi everyone! the new MLP ep was soooo awesome! That is all!
God that gave me nightmares as a kid
that guy looks a bit like edward scissor hands
i prefer vergil
But I already made these exact same complaints about this movie.
lol
you are a pirate!
The real lie loked pretty grayed out as well
:)
That they visualised a Bandersnatch-- which was one word in a poem, and never defined-- is impressive.
RAWRity, you know that all these fairy-tales (like Alice) are actually dark gloomy stories?
justwannahavefun: Eeyup
:D
*life looked
^
Hey guys my computer damn well CRASHED.
04Anymore questions?
ALICE!!!!
Go to Snud.
i forgive you
guessing your fairly new here then pony_3607? ^^
DRAT. Thought it was a pegasus >.>
noooooooo!
What has this fandom done to me?
To be honest, the story's not about drugs. It's a pastiche about Non-Euclidean Mathematics
ohshi-
lol
Next week will be one of my favorites, for some reason.
Bad luck EmeraldChocolate.

RAWRity: Maybe this is actually a WWII movie.

My work here is done! Bye all!
rbrbrbrbrbrbrb
what movie is playing next week?
this is killing my braincells
So, is Alice in Wonderland about drugs, or Mathematics?
so for now
I know this will sound horrible, but I think it's kind of cool they're putting Dash in the hospital.
/me bonks kirzstryfe on the noggin with a mug.
i'll stick toyoutube
So we know their world isn't perfect.
both?
haha
why are we watching this again?
00,10and this whole part was just to show off the 3d
anyone knows if theres going to be an episode where trixie comes back??
...
0,14One quick one: Which rooms EXACTLY are we supposed to be watching?
incoming
/me hugs meanwhil as many times before passes out
That fly by...so much better in 3D...
/me BLOWS AWAY kirzstryfe WITH HIS ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE
*cough*
Dashie_Dashie: yes, but the visuals don't have to be dark and dull and grey for the story to be dark.
no
sure, let's go with both
hope so
Um, whatever you're into there, Cavy.
It's about putting a piece of timber in a dress and calling it Alice.
Eenope
big head o.o
Yeah.
god
I don't see why everyone is complaining.
i didnt like trixie

BBH Red Queen
RAWRity: Personally, it has to do with the atmosphere :3
frogs
Haha
Toads!
Sheeee's got a BIIIIIG face!
04We had teams originally
Frogs are awesome
^
that's just my opinion though.
euclid on the block!
hypno toads! hypn toads everywhere!!!
i told the red queen i ate 2 tarts
but i really ate 3
queen's head scares me
run for yo life froggy!
Speaking of movies, I was on Fandango and found "My Little Pony" on there I was like WHUT. Haha.
Ironic, given the jab at Corsetry as being oppressive, no?
I bet Tom stole the tarts
Who here thinks the last roundup may have a connection to the next episode?
5,4 I am not food.
OKAY ! 6! I ATE 6 TARTS!
who want's frog legs?
fail
MY EYES.
04But that kind of quickly dissolved when real life situations happened, so we'd have mods who were assigned to one room move to another one to take over
/me nom Nittany_Discord
and Nittany_Discord ouch
1,3om nom nom
RUN FROGGY RUN
aw
OFF WITH HIS HEAD.

YEAAAAAAAH
Sudden speed increase.

http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41592_140754722613751_9738_n.jpg
probably
Discord would have made this movie a thousand and 4 times better.
so stephen fry and john delancie sound similar
we can rebuild him
There's actually a lot of discussion of Logic, in the books.
The cat started out creepy in the original book. He's gonna stay tyhat way. Deal.
I want a cat like that
wow
delancie would have made a great cheshire cat too
I hear Superbrony likes to put it on, but idk if it's normally scheduled
Hopefully
we have technology

somehow, the wonderland reminds me of the shivering isles and this scene reminds meof the wabajack, sheogorath quest from skyrim
Okay, a really effective weight loss drug.
Why must you complain about the same things two nights in a row RAWRity. It was boring enough the first time.
I have to admit, that is a good hiding spot

This is the first time I've ever streamed a ponies episode

Alice would probably be better off with a sword she could actually use.
when in doubt... OFF WITH THEIR HEADS~
then... all Hell broke loose.
/me hugs DeroyHooves` back

I KNOW
heads are overrated anyway

Make all the refernces~!
Same.
As I find it more satisfactory
with*
it freaking 'sploded lol
keep calm and off with their heads
While the onus is on the user to read the rules, the fact is that they often don't, so to minimise the loss of users that could add to our regular count I'm proposing this - when banning a user, make sure to include in the kick reason that they need to appeal the ban if they wish to return and provide out email address.
It's a lot more fun.
i didnt think this movie would be my cup of of tea but i kinda like it lol see what i did their:D
Plus, My Dashgasm about the next episode.
So.
RAMIREZ! Slay that Jabberwockey!

/me shakes leg
was a good cartoon that :()
but what b movie do we have today?
fez
DONT GIVE IT UP HATTAH
Right proper Alice size.
DREAMIN
There's cider... and then there's cider.
trollcatinahat
I heard Epic Movie will not be shown for Euro show
DONT GIVE IT UP ALICE
more tf2
I know
life is misleading...
XD
Where'd One piece come from? LOL
i love the cat
cider is not nessisarly alcoholic
gleetings
Cider is not hard cider
YO
bold?
"I'd come back in one piece"
thats hard cider
Epic Movie has been WMC'd
But it lagged before the one piece
oh!
DREAMIN DONT GIVE IT GIVE IT UP GIVE IT NOOOOOOO
as in no more showing of it
Applejack is more suspicious.
they'll turn it to juice for the UK version
as in ing?
To deal with this what is being proposed is that when a user is banned, not only their hostname should be stored in the forum thread, but also the nick(s) they used, and the offending post that resulted in their ban.
like non alcohol free beer?
*ping
GOD NO
Epic Movie took a WMC to the face.
; hrm.
-non
Oh had :C
what does WMC mean?
NOT 4KIDS
Yes.
LOL
The Euros are lucky
the ponys drinking the cider looked a bit drunk after it
Worst Movie Clause.
Worst Movie Clause
just to elimnate the confusion
Worst Movie Clause
we don't have cider here
oh damn
!
basically, the movie was SO horrible
Why does hatter remind me of Willy wonka?
For films that are so bad they should never be seen again.
brb
Like, i'd rather watch G3 ponies.
we don't EVER show it again here
Good thing I wasn- Nevermind~ I would want to see it~
i just switched in for that movie
Anything being played in its place?
Screw G3
This way there is no confusion about which of the recorded hostnames belong to which banned members, and we can clearly see why they have received a ban.
YEA SAME HERE
derpy_pony: Where do you live?
>.>
g 3.6
yeaaaa
germany
Kencolt I know
XD
No that's Links Awakening
G3 is...
Eh.
g1 and g4 ftw
we cider here in new england
Guys
germany has beer though
1,3if someone says your name or you say theirs it will ping them, if you're using the on page client
is there another b-movie then?
Sup?
Incase you weren't aware...
I saw Epic Movie when I was 10 and thought it was terrible
There are no apples in Germany? :O
G3.6 is absolutely repulsive
Mhm
How do I put this... Plan Nine is a shing, beautiful star of glory next to.. to...
whenever your user is refered to you get pinged
Season 3 was confirmed to be in production.
=P
no one brews apples into beer
basically
can't wait to see the new episode of my little pony..
Orly?
yeaaaaa
AWWWWW YEAHHH
Oh I knew that
Kencolt: indeed
wooooooo
Oooooooh. :) I get it now.
Yep.
xD
Knew it, but still. YUS
We should tell main chat.
...yay... :(
Amazon: did you miss today's ep?
yep
Plan 9 is a masterpiece
-_- Well I guess I cant go the casino JUST yet
fruit wine, yes...but...it's not exactly non alcoholic
back just in time
i know, i heard from everypony it is horrible so i wanted to see it myself
Did it ping for you?
SEASON 3 CONFIRMED!
Poop poopooooop
i missed the stream :(
but it doesnt display bold on your screen
yes
just telled them
Oh, okay.
dat mouse has got BALLS
Evaporating skills are where it's at.
So make sure that whenever you ban someone, you make an appropriate post about it on the forum thread.
hipsterpizza: Where?
hipsterpizza: source?
i think i was like an hour late
to ping type in a name EXACTLY how it is written
Woah~
Wikipedia.
Hipster told 'em.
Case sensitive
what was that?
Alrighty.
season 3 has been confirmed for some time, hasn't it.
I found it.
=P
They be asking for sauce
It's no the fun sort of horrible
Yea.
Amazon: I have a link to the YT upload if you want it
For quite a while.
It's the painful kind
hipsterpizza:we all knew that
Okay. There was no B movie shown last night. None at all. Certainly none enyone here saw. There was a stragne gapof 90 minutes in the stream that no-pony complained about. No B-movie. THAT'S MY STORY AND I'M STICKING TO IT.
I'm sorry
Sometimes, Dead is better
New York produces lots of apples, but not Texas.
Just go on Wikipedia.
Kencolt: good one
I used the last of my sauce in my sammich
Sounds legit Kencolt
they already know
1,3and I won't ping unless you PM me directly, using a separate client and I haven't set it up to ping me yet :)
:D
otokan sure, thanks friend :)
who do you choose?
yeah
Oh, okay.
I can has link too? :(
So the Apple Family should probably have Cheewee Accents
pikachu
...
Any questions?
Yep.
mods dont use flash for the record
choose your pokemon!
I'm just new here, so I don't know much about this.
So... who else is just waiting for ponies? >.>
most of them use mIRC
Wikipedia.
Yep
:| The Great and Powerful Trxie approve of your message regarding S3
Who's that pokemon?
I come here for the chat.
I choose Mallyum-kun
okay so if Epic Movie for WMC'd then whats gonna be the second movie?
gary oak
Also, I heard that Bronystate was the cause of a major chat reaction?
/me is actually watching the movie~
Why would the Apple family sound like wookies?
I'll post the sentence.
Jabba the hut
lol Jim
1,3it's just really hard to use the flash client and watch every room we have to watch
Involving 6_9
it took place here
what?
the reaction
I wish I was there.
/me is trying to watch but stupid lag
tru
^Wikipedia
You stoopid.
I wasnt
wont let me watch it
why not show a better B movie. like Plan Nine from Outer Space?
I was in the regulars room
vendetta: STUPID GIRL
9doesn't seem like it. Move ahead.
Oh.
I know, I read about on facebook
Cheewees are people who live way north in Upstate NY.
That's not who you are~
...yay... :(
Ok.
at the time that is
I hated Plan Nine.
Ahh, that makes sense
Am I allowed to put down a quote from Wikipedia?
=P
And, here's a question. Are each of the rooms on Bronystate different?
you rock...woohoo :(
08,14TALLY HO
portal 2 title screem
so isn't there any b-movie at all?
awww..... innocent alice
^.^
in what way?
theme
probably not
Damn.
"What is this?"
flashback
Still say we watch Twinkle Wish Adventure...
It's about S. 3
Sparta?
=/
Hey I got another suggestion. Lets watch the MST3K version of a movie.
About our policy on bans.
1,3they're different chat channels, but they all link to the same video stream
Like rules or number of people, or type of people different?
okay, let me ask again. Since Epic Movie got WMC'd then what are we going to watch for the second movie?
yeah
JTDrift: I agree!
No one knows.
1,3rules are the same
same rules, different people
It's real~
ish
Oh, okay.
what if alice's true life is all a dream.. and this is the real world?
So, its Movie Pony Move 2 Pony New Pony
1,3use numbers and personalities are pretty varied
Ponies are on front page.
^
Meanwhile: Thank you
So far the way we have run is that a ban is always permenant unless appealed.
which make things good you can also make a different room
Alrighty. I get it now.
back to the future 2 is a worthy B movie
is this real life?
Anytime.
Movie 2*
How long has this movie been running for?
what's movie 2?
2 hours
I dunno
epic movie
or is this just fantasy?
*cue for the lunar replublic music*
No clue quite yet.
FOREVVVURRRR
It's near the climax I think
Suprise I believe.
typically new people prefer to be in the mane6 channels during movie night
I think I'm gonna like Bronystate.
caught in a landslide...
i think mlp should have a making fiends crossover
Caught in a landslide
you will
dat white horse
trust us
1,3I do :3
It froze on meh D:
rarity!
Try to escape Reality
no escape from reality
So I'd like to discuss changing this to allow for timed bans for certain offenses.
Lucky.
xD
so open your eyes and see
Open your eyes
Omg that show
There are peach orchards, tho... and Aj is a peach for sure.
i'm jsut a poor boy
That girl looks like a trranny :o

The hatter is best pony by far~
The Chessmen and Cadrs are freaking awesome.
...
I need no sympathy
I need no sypmathy
C-c-c-c-combo breaker.

now THAT'S a epic mount!
finally an armor
END SO WE CAN WATCH PONY.
=P
'cause I'm easy come
brony vs brony haters is what this battle is :D
Obviously anyone who is deliberately breaking the rules with the intention of annoying users and trolling will still receive a perm ban that needs appeal.
Kavy: EEYUP!
easy go
by the way we offer more than just new eps and movies
elf metal is so light
little high
a little high
silly white knights
but no lance
Chess army > Card army
DONT GIVE IT UP WHITE QUEEN
little low
no eye of sauron?
White: Brony
1,3and yeah, the mane chat channel gets pretty hectic during the movie and episode streams
Fact: I heard of Bronystate when I went to Equestria Daily today.
i am dissappoint
DONT GIVE IT UP HATTAH
White queen, rofl
i like the scene she kills the dragon
Anyway the wind blows
yep
it doesn't really matter to meeeeee
WE will battle on the Royal Chess board
Red: Brony Hater.
To me
one does not simply walk into wonderland#
she can't seriously try to use a sword on this giant rat....she needs a lance
Every does XD
DONT GIVE IT UP GIVE IT UP GIVE IT NOOOOOO

Or the biggest checkered pattern floor~
Eeeyup.

eeyup
:)
in a sense
1,3we usually have stuff running throughout the week in addition to the weekend streams
Mewanna?
But what if one of the fighters is Stephen Hawking?
YOU SHALL NOT PASS
hmm.... pawn to AC14
But for other members a better protocol might be, first offense timed ban (length depending on offense), second ban perm (with chance of appeal), third ban perm no appeal.
GO GAREN
damn it
Like Violet's radical radio
DAMACIA
Then one shall stand and one shall sit
everytime you make one piece references ill do that
Checkered pattern floor, evocative of a chessboard.

I don't want to be a mod until I feel responsible enough. Probably a few months... years... centuries... :D

And the movie's over.
Haha
Pony time is great :D
00,06It's everyone's duty to do everything. If someone else beats you to it, so be it, but if everyone assumes that it's someone else's job, nothing gets done.
Same.
F1 is like chuch here
SB, speed up the credits
is it return of harmony part 2 right?
PONIES
Yep
But I like Nascar 2
No, Amazon, you'll prolly have to wait a bit for that...
Everytime you kill a blue butterfly, Fluttershy cries.
/me hugs %LordCelestia

I'll admit. I did enjoy Strange Wilderness, a movie that has a perfect 0% on rottentomatoes.
Ah well, I think The Return of Harmony is next?
:(
yea :'(
NO DARI! you have to play the harp... you want one of those things to pop out the ground
IT'S OVER, IT'S FINALLY OVER
Next up, Return to Harmony: Part 2, I believe?
And then everjabberwocky came

Rainbow is spicy as hell
granted it made a fuckton of money, so I wouldn't be surprised if we see another Tim Burton Alice movie in the next few years.
epic movie is not THAT bad
Taste the rainbow

She's a hug-maniac. She hugs ponies. She doesn't know why. She doesn't know how. She just does it-- hugging. It's all she does. She can't be reasoned with. She can't be negotiated with. She's a huginator.

It's nice to watch the first episode I watched again~

I like that bear joke
RAWRity: no wrong. it is the GREATEST show
*placebo has disconnected
Combustiblelemons: tru dat
Evil!Twilight.
Define
this is probably the best episode to date.
EmeraldChocolate: refresh the stream, that fixed it for me
emangamer: nah, i like Daily Show better.
hmmm, seems that mips.tv is only sending betwene 10 and 50k a second, should be about 100

He snaps his finger!
Thx Quill

I'm touching yo gem!
:|
Iweywrt: draquonaquis.
Nyria: Get out of my head!
Draconequus

Yay :D
8,1me and shizu have almost finished the initial featureset that we got when we started workign on BS2.0

Cypresswolf I can live with that.

Bunnies
Just kidding, you are welcome in my head <3

1,3rule 63
lion king!
simba
i already did
Ooo ok~
XD
Combustiblelemons: indeed they will
8,1i think we were hoping (certainly i was) to make an initial release possibly next weekend, but we'll have to push it back for these new features
i cant see said the blind pony
lolololololololol
got definition on urbandictionary
was it?
8,1again, something to be discussed in the tech meeting
Dont worry, you won't
07,01yep
Not enough discorded Rainbow Dash here.
....possible synopsis: When no pony has seen or heard from the princesses for sometime....*fill in the blank*
mane 6 already make ponyville the chaos capital of equestria.
1,3probably the one safe place to learn of it
Om nom brownies. What did I miss?
looks like the sonic bonus zones
tom!
for every male character there is a female character
I HATE EVERYTHING
10,02Dat Tom
basically
8,1but i estimate we could have everything done certainly by the end of february, if not sooner
Hello Tom :)
Francis Pie
dat sexybrony64 <3
Tom rocs
ah, it was a tab fail. sry Starflash
Tom wants to come in too :(
eeyup
TOM
13o/ amendment - we could always finish up the critical stuff needed to replace the current site, and roll things out later
Tom, you are very handsome today.
Rarity X Tom
dat Tom envy
wait... did the flim flam bros ep already come on?
sepia tone time
look out here comes tim
She mad bro.
Yeah
MUDKIP
came on before alice
No problem Phase4 ~
Your face
Guess I missed nothing at all.
and also came on earlier today
D8 evil Fluttershy!
08,14Like minekraft
Yea, it'll air after this, the next movie, and then another episode of Ponies.
FRICK
did anyone else think they were gonna turn to stone?
UR Face!
SuperBrony64: hey SB, whats soaking wet and clueless?
I used to sleep, then I took a bucket to the ehad
his face?
13^
That tree wall is so thin~
1,3we'll be restreaming today's new episode at the end of movie night
lol
Your Face!
you face!
dat face
Empty bucket is now full.
i love that ^_^
Movie Afternoon for the US
=P
8,1aye, we could do that; but i think it'd be good to have everything out together if we can. obviously, this makes for certain managerial headaches, but i think it'll be worth it
10,02emangamer: What?
YOUR FACE!
YO FAEC
otakon, no, but I heard others say that, and it makes total sense
full of draaaaaagon
SuperBrony64: YOUR FLANK
This aired last night for the people in the US>
The part of his cranium composed of his eyes mouth and nose?
10,02O___o
XD
ouch,,
lolwut?!?!
It was under E!
ya i saw the lineup
gotta say, not sure why Your Face! got so popular.
..
Okay~
Remeber, this is the Euro Stream, so they will show the new episode.
No worries.
emangamer with that... joke
13that way we can have things like easier stream switches and managing the site earlier, then 2.0 stuff like forums when they're ready
aj didnt lie
you have magic twi >.>
Especially since Discord says "I don't turn ponies into stone!" and he obviously lies
1,3emangamer: that SB flank is mine :p
00,10Is there gonna be way to roll out some of the needed fetures sooner or is this an all in one deal?
Randomnerd: yeah, that's what I thought. Probably thought it was too much for the writers to do
RAWRity: IDK either. Same could be said for fluttertree or 20% cooler
no you get the leg kirzstryfe
timmy
o_____0
kirzstryfe: You should claim it~
My estimate is roughly at 6:30 Us East. Possibly Later.
taraaaaa
kirzstryfe: LIES...its all secret and lies with you mods.
8,1from a publicity standpoint, releasing everything together and making a big show of it draws more attention to *all* the new featuers
Twirage
your timmy turners showing
this is anoying, alot of work went into getting the bandwidth and then mips lags out. worked last night
/me jumps on SuperBrony64's plot and noms his tail
Gg tom
Probably 7-7:30 actually.
perty stars
10,02O____o
thought so
10,02My tail D:
ill take book...and READ it!
emangamer: flutter tree was at least clever, and 20% cooler is because RD is a meme factory, but Your Face! is a joke that's been used tons of times before.
MY PRECIOUS...
so around 11:30 - 00:30 for the UK. Sounds good
8,1well, we're moving to a completely new site infrastructure (wordpress), so backporting seems kinda pointless IMO
/me gives SuperBrony64 such a hard smack on his flank that it throws kirzstryfe off
woooooo
the elements
Your face!
but i like discord :(
missed it on tv so ehh yup
inb4 spike is rainbow dash
mfw there is a user named Kimiko:Kira_Pony_Yamato!srhczuiwpg@jhmg-660-235-292-741.sip.mgm.bellsouth.net
RAWRity: maybe that's why. just like TALK ABOUT EYECANDY
I have a book
10,02Big crown thingy!
woah, calm down twilight
13think this is better left for the tech meeting next week, back to luna
Turn to page 394
emangamer: talk about eyecandy?
xD
8,1we're talking a matter of weeks to release here, so i don't think the wait will make that much difference
big crown thingy
umad?
BEST LINE!
8,1aye
^
TALK ABOUT EYE CANDY!!!!1
10,02Spike is now Rainbow Dash
Annnnnnnnd spike is RD

I doubt he wanted a promotion.
10,02Here comes Tom!
Attack! Attack! Attack!
Yay :(
/me nomms on kirzstryfe so hard that he falls off of SuperBrony64's flank forever
MY FLANK
Too bad! You're Rainbow Dash.

Here comes tom

Limev?
are you happy or sad?
Ponies are supposed to go Neigh
when did we switch back to LimeV?
1,3it'll never last forever emangamer ;)
/me is the new Rainbow Dash

07,01next is Team input (gained via forums)
00,10I never noticed discord with two heads before
There is a missing texture on the floor
just making sure
chaos is a wonderful thing
RAWRity: no he's best villan because he isn't actually evil...he just does it for da lulz
Poor berrypunch
did he just do a Ourobouros?
Is it just me, or is he the pony sheogorath?
07,01*Discuss new IRC modes (SB)
07,01*Stream courtesy (SB)
07,01*Communication improvement (SB)
07,01*Stream schedule available to viewers. so that viewers can look forward to certain content streamed throughout the week. Fluttershy created a Google document for it, but I think we need to discuss it a bit more in detail as a team. (SB)
Sumica: I just noticed it too
07,01*Embed switching (SB)
07,01*Ops / hops in bronystate rooms
Wish Discord was real....
you said you were only a two week brony
Discord had 2 heads?
dammit discord >:(
hmm....chocolate cotton candy..... *looks for recipe*
Dashie: kind of
emangamer: no, he's evil. He's just charismatic about it.
i speant like 9 hours and watched all the way to S2E14 last weekend
I wouldn't mind chaos
hmmm
Sucessful troll is sucessful
chessboard world? that seems a little too... orderly
Affably evil :D
My chat broke ... again~!
he's not really evil
every texture is missign!
Rainbow Dash is backe dup.
neither would I
Chocolate candy?
Spike vomited all over the floor
backed up*
00,10yeah he had a head at both ends of his body
10,02Oh my...that's a lot from me.
1,3hehe
07,01eeeyup
Spike is suffering from Spam
Why Rainbow Dash so sick?
1,3fun times
wat.
Wait, is that Scootaloo in the background?
spam email
13guess sb has the floor
I didn't see
Blarg
Kavy: Oh you
Well, was that.
RAWRity: not really...he just enjoys a good laugh....maybe not a NICE laugh...but a good laugh none the less
10,02I guess it's best to get started with the list
Sumica: that's because Discord is master of Dark Space
manly tears are being shed
Trollestia strikes again
re colorify Twi recolorify!
I learned nothing
Oh I remember sheding a single tear~
chills
00,10indeed, I just never caught it before

dat spell breaking
Discord is not evil. He is chaos
BAAAARF

Poor Spike.
Sumica: and THAT is why MLP is such a good show
Pinkie hop

neh imma go, already saw the vid :?
who had two heads?

Fleur: he's not evil he's just pinkie ^2000000
inb4 great speech!
Discord Fleur
07,01Okay, what did you want to know about the IRC modes?
what will s3 villian be?
FOR EQUESTRIA!
omg win
DisFleur...amypony?
IKR
10,02Anyway, the first topic is about the new IRC modes. I'm not sure what has happened since that point, but previously the inability to change nicks and type out messages in all-caps has upset a number of viewers.
*scratches head*
Fleur is Discord?
I'm back. Against my better judgement
Who knows Combustiblelemons.
that last part about friends having a special magical connection bafore they meet is true in the first ep with the CMC
no >_>
hmmm
Fleurcord?
Nightmare Fleur
for the emporor
no idea
poor spike
I'm just happy there will be a Season 3.
lol X
=P
To help you folks make it through the next movie
Fleur: why not? Disfleur is best villan
It froze when he was derping
Discord is a Force of Nature.
Big Mac used dig
big mac is winona!
emangamer: he lied and manipulated others in order to drive friends apart, he upturned Ponyville and concievably the rest of Equestria. He completely fucked up everybody's life for his own amusement. He's Evil. He a likeable villain with personality and charisma, but he's still Evil.
thats sounds terrible
oh shit... pigs fly.... might as well pay up
Also, hey there Dig Mac.

man
how do any of those scenes show truth and not lies?
Hey guys:
10,02I understand originally that this way implemented due to a recent bot attack, however, after hearing a lot from a number of viewers including an IRCop, the modes implemented have been unnecessary.

I guess I just enjoy pain
hi EspyLacopa
Hewlett Packard is making My Little Pony themed laptops.

00,06Deal with it.
1,3it got WMC'd last night
Woohoo
RAWRity: he just looked at the worst part of their personality.
Lawl
emangamer: yes. yes he did. He told RD that Cloudsdale was being destroyed when it wasn't.
Fluttershy's Rescue. o_O
10,02Sounds legit.
EspyLacopa: Do want!
yay~
*couldlve used her magic the whole time she was battling discord* *didnt use it until the end*
Fluttershy likes Bondage
The nick change mode has been removed
flutter bondage
i saw it when me and my friend bought all 26 eps of S1
._.
WAH
Ayeee
May I toss link into channel?
introducing: Bitchnomore!!!!
Then what is the next film this time?
tom, GTFO
now we are watching one a day on the bus
You serious, emangamer? Pity HP makes such garbage laptops though.
00,06Nick change mode and all caps mode were removed.
Poor Tom got rejected :(
1,3if it follows the rules EspyLacopa
:(
00,10depends on the link EspyLacopa
RAWRity: he never said Cloudsdale, he said your home, which was ponyville which was being destroyed
let us never speak of this again
Tom is best bachelor
tom got stone-zoned
LordDerpington: dat tab fail

I'll have to rewatch this again on youtube

Yes
It is John DeLancie
K sorry
BEGIN STAR WARS SEQUENCE!
wow, that is one strong hateshield
Hello Starwars
00,06+J prevents automatically rejoining when kicked. +j 5:1 makes it so only 5 people can join per second, though this isn't an issue as we only usually get 1-2 a second during pony eps, which means no 100+ bots joining at once. +K prevents repeat messages, helping to stop bot attacks. +L is a larger ban list size, set by an IRCOp. +n is prevents external messages from being sent to the
0,6channel. +P makes the channel permanent. And +t makes it so that the topic can only be changed by Ops.
and then star wars#
Iweywrt: Yp
I love how even after this, no one knows whothy are
RAWRity: yes it is. in his mind Chaos is good
dat blatant starwars ref
Lol, I always thought DC was stoned (badum tsh)

So.... what happened to the stoned Discord?
So, how about them poni poni

It was funny going to the star wars video after this
*Throws moniter*

Wait, did I switch to Star Wars by accident?

Scumbag Blueblood : Meet National Hero, act like a jerk to her.
Yay...you rock...woohoo :(
Same
Yeah :P
Hitler was also mentally retarded, like actually :P
Just because somebody has justified it in their own minds doesn't mean they can't be evil.
00,06Hmm?
*appluases*
Aww...

Hey StinkomanFan

Intermission then.
dat weird belly button
SuperRule63!
best intermission ever
hello

Epic movie next like last night?
Which one?
I think the point is that Discord is wrong.
Intermission :)
Get some Popcorn and stuff guys.
Derpy in a popcorn
I hope not
I want that picture
00,06But for scriptkiddies, who don't know what they're doing, it'll stop them.
brb need a drink!
hi ratdeathtrap
Whos up for Epic Movie?!?! ROflmao
wow i've been here so long and still it is first time i see the intermission window
Oh food time for me~
lets all go to the lobby and grab ourselves a treat!
Like Luna. Just because you're lonely doesn't excuse bad behavior.
Wait! AJ is Han in this part no? Han winks at the girl he is into. AJ winks at princess celestia. *Fleur's mind explodes from accidental canon shipping*
and drink~
welp
Link to the Derpy Popcorn pic?
10,02Intermission time! Time for popcorn and snacks!

You wrote something new Stinko? :)

Ate all my popcorn this morning during the showing.
Lobby?

Getting kicked in the face doesn't make being mean okay.

1,3the bad of the bad of the horrendous, to never be shown again
So I have chocolate bars and juice.
SuperBrony64, be a dear and throw me some popcorn through the screen
Are you gonna play epic movie again or suprise movie?

Yep.
*listens to yoshis island story theme*
which way are the bathrooms?
In before +m that isn't coming.
lol
Fleur: spike winks too
My tab key is trying my paitence
This music is so relaxing
Suprise Movie I think.
=P
my timing
If Epic Movie is playing again, I suggest everyone break out the alcohol. Maybe the movie will be tolerable that way.
Intermission time... *thinks about the intermission time in Kung-Pow: Enter the Fist"
OH GOD
Are we watching Epic movie? I need to know if I should go get a gun to shoot myself five minutes in
+m :3
like a hall of shame type thing
gona go to the toilet, stretch my wings, grab some treats and come back. See ya'll in a few mins
hey everybody
do it fillies
oh crap i forgot about the lotto
Okay
hey Yellowquiet
I guess while we wait
Equestria

Brb, I require to empty myself

Haha
Epic Movie got WMCed from what I'm told.
Let me get a soda.
/me hugs everyone

Ah yes
1,3yeah

^^
Anypony hae the link to the intermission pic?
This is my first time watching movies with you guys, what usually gets shown?
Worst movie clause.
And watch yout allcaps.
1,33rd movie to get WMC'd
sooo what are we watching next?
Fleur: ah ok
1,3*third
8,1they don't impede normal channel operation, and stop some autorejoins and script kiddie attacks
What wins the lotto Volmise
Kira_Pony_Yamato: no link, that is a bronystate owned pic
Epic Movie
That one, and yes I am working on a new one Ictiv
Volmise... there is a lotto ^^
Epic Movie did not qualify for WMC imo. It wasnt /that/ bad.
Ahh, ok
Oh, I see!
oh ok thanks
Thanks anyway.
wheres the little fillys room
10,02MakerDusk was informing us that they have many precautions setup to prevent such attacks in the future.
Fleur: ...what
Yeah, so its all good stuff :D
1,3other 2 were babes in toyland and spider-something, not sure on that one's name
Epic Movie wasnt bad
Well I like everything, so this'll hopefully be a treat!
Will we watch a movie, or a few eps of MLP?
Now This
Derpy Hooves is going to get all greasy. She shouldn't hide in popcorn bins like that.
Is A Movie
00,06I'm aware that they have precautions.
Any chance you'll open a FimFiction or DevaintArt page I can follow?
so is the lottery of or does it starts ????
Spider's Web a pigs tale
Second movie is Epic Movie.
so is there gonna be a movie 2, or straight to the next pony episodes?
(Or have already?)
00,06But it never hurts to be safe ourselves.
Put on the G1 MLP movie
over*
Yellowquiet: Lotto was last night.
RAWRity: it wasnt bad... it was horrid
I want another Scary, Zomibe, or Fighting movie!!
Yellowquiet: loterry was yesterday
oh
I wish I would stop feeling like shit. :/
i am late
XD
I'm so embarrassed to post fanfic online
and who won
Yes.
I own both but I only upload my stories to FIMfiction
Fighting Movie? Street Fighter?
name of song?
mfw we have a link for that
EspyLacopa: Nope, it got banned from movie nights last night
Why do you feel that way Dashie_Dashie?
I want to put up drafts of stuff I have, but I don't need the mockery from my Ex >:(
Randomnerd FimFiction?
lets watch the matrix lol
8,1aye; it's never a good idea to take an SEP approach to security and spam
or what are we watching next time
My first tale was not so good
let's watch steamboy
Epic Movie was horrid. I wouldn't even force my worse enemy to watch it
/me hugs Dashie_Dashie "There there"
Matrix wud be nice :o
"This movie needs more leverage
the way I see WMC. It has to be almost unanimous that the move is absolute fucking shit. BiT was absolute fucking shit. Epic Movie wasnt /all/ bad. It was bearable
If we do watch The Matrix I need to change my A movie pick >_>
I haven random anxiety attacks that make me feel horrid.
OneTrickPony: seconded
its not our choice if i am yet to belive
dat /all/
like extremely sick to my stomach
so
Yeah, I'm working on a story re: Luna, and a story that was kind of inspired by the ep we just watched.
Oh no >.<
hmmm
let's listen to a reading of My Little Dashie
this
Only 2 stars :s
song
also, the makers of Epic Movie also are making a new movie: "The Biggest Movie of All Time 3D"
why?
8,1i was concerned that 5:1 on +j was too low, but if you've measured influx at 2:1 on pony ep days, it should eb fine
Randomnerd: I'm sure it can't be too bad
OneTrickPony: after Euronight
Fic readings are borring
i remeber it
10,02Indeed, but the main argument went away after disabling +n and +G
Babes in Toyland would have been fine if the 90 minute version had played.
To be fair, I can understand where both Fleur and dari are coming from.
okay
/me pats Dashie_Dashie on the head, 'Im sorry" :(
so 2 hours of barely bearable movie badness?
Basically, a neeeeeighboring kingdom gets the idea that the Elements of Harmony are an ACTUAL weapon.
i don't like fics fleur
My little dashie was boring.
00,06You mean +d and +G
8,1aye, i think those are only useful temporarily
RAWRity: Hope you're kidding.
Dashie_Dashie: You should probably try to get some rest if you feel that ill
neither do I Combustiblelemons
10,02Yeah, +d.
Nittany_Discord: nope.
RAWRity: they made meet the spartans and super hero movie as well
and I'm back
i don't have the patience to read them
00,06And as I had said, they were in place to prove a point.
wb Dashie
ty :3
I'm back
Like "Destroy a City" kind -so they attempt to kidnap the Mane 6.
or the reason to :/
They didn't make Super Hero Movie
well, that tasted good.... what now?
ey
or the time for that matter.
super hero movie was best parody
Well that seems an interesting starting point :)
I may switch from my laptop to my computer...
I'm back
name of that song pls ^^
I guess when people go and see that stuff.
they basically live to make horrible pop-cult spoofs :P
spaceballs was best parody
^
Salutations everypony
I actually started digging through earlier generations for char names.
I can't sleep during anxiety attacks, my mind races to much.
Same.
The Last Airbender wasn't slapped with the WMC, if I remember right? I'd call that a far inferior movie myself, and mind, I thought Epic Movie was trash of the highest order. :|
spaceballs was amazing
we can watch jumumji
It's why games people say are crap sell well.
00,06That constant nickchanges and constant messages in ALL CAPS become incredibly irritated, and are privileges that can easily be taken away.
Follow the money.
Combustiblelemons: What about Young Frankenstein?
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1929394/
Hopefully by limiting the story's perspective to only one charactor I can make it a bit easier to understand
I see your swartch is as big as mine
00,06*irritating
Boohoo everyone has an opinion.
Solid
Serious or more Dr. Strangelove esque?
Walk Hard and Black Dynamite were the only good spoof movies from the last decade.
The single greatest parody IMHO is Young Frankenstien.
It had Frankie dancing on the Ritz!
Or maybe even Mel Brooks?
the last airbender was shockingly bad, I'd rather watch the animated series
And SCIENCE
lol we should watch Megashark vs Giant Octopus
More joking than serious.
eh, well, think i'll just watch the new ep on YT and then call it a night. Already past midnight here :P
Maybe it's an old Ed Wood movie
when is the movie startin
Dashie: the animated series is GREAT
omg yes
it is
Last Airbender kinda counts as a spoof.
Start Praying Boys
That's not fair Dashie the animated series is amazing
13o/ point of contention
Freeman: soon
wasted my money on the last airbender. the 3d was bad -_--
I already like the sound of it :)
ok
Lets face it, Parody movies are not as good these days :(
00,06?
the animated seriesisamazng
The Mane 6 aren't in much actual danger, so far. I wanna keep it PG-13 or lower.
enope
Spending money on any 3D is a waste.
I wanna see legend of korra.
how long does the intermission last?
13taking the ball away isn't a good way to develop rapport with the viewers
not to put anyone on the spot or anything but... (vo.o)v That.
hence I'd rather watch that than the movie
arrowtobroknee: me too
I am talking about the new movies
10 minutes usually, ekips
Last Airbender live action movie failed because of M Night Shyamamallama-sama-kun.
sorry ther
8,1i agree with shizu on that
I find movies with the word "movie" in the title to be, well, not that good
thank you LordDerpington
there* had to help out my roommate
Say Randomnerd, what was that name you gave me for my pony last night?
00,06I had tried other methods, and they didn't work.
Orwas that somepony else
RAWRity: well put
Epic Movie > Disaster Movie
13if we're going to make an effort to be less uptight, then we can't go smacking down everyone just because some caused trouble
Tally Ho
young frankenstein was awesome too but spaceballs was funnier
I'm comfortable now :)
10,02Brace yourself for +m everypony!
8,1actually, that was something i wanted to bring up in general later
Someone else, I was out drinking
/me braces
AHHHHHHH!
8,1i'm not sure if i put it on my list or not
10,02Alright so...
That didn't hurt.
00,10what is this +m you speak of?
Sat in one of those chairbeds
with the bed bit out
so I'm laid in bed (no you pervert, not like that)
or maybe its the 'new' Ed Wood movie about the old Ed Wood movies
1,3Nittany, cover your shame
Well now I need ANOTHER new name
with a drink :3
13my body was not ready
10,02After yesterday's horrible reception to our B movie, Epic Movie, we wish to offer you all the choice of what will happen.
Nah, that was an A movie
Forgot that I'm naked.
About B movies
What do they do?
07,01ewww Nitt!
05,15hey everyone Nittany_Discord is naked!

07,01put some clothes on will you?!
What. I forgot.
It's a cowpony, y'know old west kinda thing
05,1532X
10,02Your second choice: We watch some fan-favorite Pony episodes
And since we don't really have a fixed movie to watch, we might aswell watch anotehr A, no?
13,01I'll have to borrow SB's maid outfit.

Epic Movie sped up
Yeah but as dari did point out (accurately), Epic Movie was pretty much trying to be bad. And it was. It just wasn't an enjoyable bad by any means. TLA was trying to be an epic movie and fell so flat that it broke its nose and the entire front row of teeth.
Give me a rough description and I try to make something up for him

Sure.
The thing that raises Young Frankenstien above Spaceballs is that in a real sense it can be taken NOT as a parody, but as a proper part of the Frankenstien frannchise-- just a humorous one.
/me flips a table, it landed on Tovler.

To claim that M Night was "trying" with Last Airbender is to put to shame the effort of every director and film ever
