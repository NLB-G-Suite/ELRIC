Scoot-Scootaloo: why the webcam?

Irish_Pony: Love you <3

Yay my comment
Okay, sorry, never doing that again
8,6Reikim, don't mess with the text
I'll give you a hint it's somthing that you eat in the summer
holy crap..
Sorry, kirzstryfe. Again, never doing that again.
Solar_Flutter: Ice cream.
watermelons aren't houses.
So anyway, hello again everyone.
mmmmmm watermelons
Solar_Flutter: popsiciles (but spelt right)
/me is allergic to watermelons
Okay, so tonight's episode of Deadman WOnderland was pretty good. But damn if that dub doesn't have some clunky lines.
I wonder how ice cream sandwiches work so perfectly...
well water melons was the answer
TWILY!
RAWRity: Par for the course for all dubs.
Let's go to sketch heroes!
but you were close Spell-of-gaming
Reikim: Not all. There are some dubs that are fantastic.
RAWRity: Mm, yes, but they're above par.
For instance: Cowboy Bebop, Princess Mononoke, Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad
RAWRity: Example: Cowboy Bebop. Spectacular dubbing there.
And then i was all SQUEE
12.What has a head, a tail, is brown, and has no legs?
Me
And the dub for DMWL is pretty good. But somethimes it has lines like this: "Oh Man, like he's slicing a damn Pizza."
I agree. Cowboy Bebop has a very rare thing - a dub that's enjoyable
back! :D
TFS?
this said about a guy who is using ARM BLADES MADE OUT OF BLOOD CUT DOWN A ROBOT
who saw the second episode of doctor whooves and assistant animated today?:3
RAWRity: ...Intentional understatement?
pony80744: type /nick Pinkamena
I dun wanna
Wrek: Wow, you're on a drawing spree today, whats the occasion?
Reikim: nope.
I'm lazy
/me hugs pony80744
Just the dub being weird.
Who has a sjetch heroes!?
For instance, last episode had this gem: "Girl just kicked a damn robot! She's got mad moves!"
*skecth
Did it work?
funnily enough, both of those lines are from the same character.
spai
http://pastebin.com/y4PF2isA That's actually a great episode idea.

hen3ry: Only Val does that. In my experience at least.
.. It's kinda tricky to do this, text, play Pokemon Silver, and MTG at the same time..
Anyway, why are we glomping Shizu again? Besides the obvious...
8,6because she needs it
8,6and wub
kirzstryfe: was there a lotto today?

MahBoi777: i see what you did there
AWESOMENESS
:P
Which part is best?
Still though, the most notable thing about the Deadman Wonderland dub is that it was clearly not intended for a TV broadcast. There were 7 different uses of the word Fuck bleeped out in the latest episode alone.
The A movie and both episode
Im liking this art so far...
Dawww. I didn't win :< Better luck next week :)

This my first time here but i seen this web before
MahBoi777: What do you think? :3
JailbaitTease: So yeah, kind of an awkward time to check it out. Not saying that the art streams aren't great - they are - but the best times are when we watch stuff together and collectively MST it.
yeah its hilarious
Hi Snow. Yay, two new members to join in the wub fest.

Reikim: I KNOW that somebody from a while back made a joke about making a pony oc called Jailbait or something like that.

RAWRity: Your thoughts on the newest ep?
03was listening to my Zune during takeoff and landing
03they didn't mind since the seats had headphone ports and apparently they couldn't tell :P
Shimmer: SHE is a very sweet girl
Poor korra

Korra... Y U NO FIREBEND?
CriticKitten: My thoughts are as such: HOLY GOD THAT ENDING.
Inorite
FlareChaser: -lol Well I did make one but it was before I had my Tablet so you got the Traditional drawing with the crappy Ipod scanner -lol
.-.
00,10if you dont like it Ponies47, come back in an hour

HE HAS A BEARD

Would have been cooler if she ripped them apart
05btw sumi
05didja see
RAWRity: really? then WHY THE HELL ISN'T TOPH!? She was as young as Aang
00,10see what?
I don't understand how only Katara and Toph are alive
not appa, but a sky bison none the less
i am sad
otakon actually, she was younger
05:P
otakon: She got bored with kicking ass here and went to the Spirit World to kick their asses instead.
Toph is alive
at least, I dont think so
?
otakon: Toph isn't dead, she's just reincarnated into a younger form
kissed = doing it
.-.
otakon: Well, she probably didn't die. She just ascended to another plane of higher existence, teaching the spirits in the art of being Badass
Wahhhh
Reikim: sounds like Toph
Toph is this world's Chuck Norris
also, brb guys
girls......geez
that was easy
I'm sorry Pinkies4thWall|sad
00,10I saw the mascot one.
cooooool
00,10Not sure what I am looking at with the darkness one.
CriticKitten: except without the rampant homophobia
aang was younger than Katara right? Either he got killed or made a heroic sacrifice?
CriticKitten: Don't even try to compare Toph to Chuck Norris. The difference being that Toph is badass despite being fairly average.
lol
00,10alien attack perhaps?
05canterlot and ponyville
obvious plot lines
.-. Toph is like chuck norris
or those 100 years in ice caught up?
RAWRity: Well yeah XD
Guys
whoa
Nothing beats Jackie Chan
...
o-o
hide the bodies
05oh well good night
05its 7:30 and i should wake up about now
she can feel her officers?
Night Wrek. Maybe actually go sleep this time.
Good night Wrek :)
00,10have a good days sleep wrek

Wrek: Y u scare my friend away?
03LOL wh\at
night Wrek
03this is an anime
....
Oh, Tenzin.
what? it got you to laugh XD
see... much cooler
That's basically the explanation given about Aang's death. While Avatar's are usually very long-living, he burned up a lot of energy in that ice berg, stuck in the avatar state. Technically he was like 166
05Pinkies4thWall|sad: cause im scary apparently
Pinkies4thWall|sad: Her name was JAILBAIT. And then she backsassed the mods and rules. It's her own fault.
.=.
makes sense
i knew it was video but wasn't sure exactly what it was
RAWRity Very True
liar liar hands on fire
Wow
....
You know when I stayed up for over 40 hours I should of listened to you guys. I crashed hard. You guys warned me :(
And then things got srs

Ponies47 I told you bro. Train your body for this sort of thing

Apple: clear your cache and refresh
I brought her in here and this is a friendly place. I met her today and wanted to share bronystate
not sure how I feel about the mechs in the series
Ok,...
DashWithRainbows: Meh. It was good pratice :P

00,10I am sorry to hear that Pinkies4thWall|sad but she staited her self she did't like the rules here.
Fire bending was bad.. Now bloodbending?
again.....outside of the box Korra think outside
Blood bending?Women would like that :D
Pinkies4thWall|sad: who are you refering to?
Combustion Man
Council.... And Sokka
Sokka. :3
boomerang ^^
Sokka sounds pretty much the same.
Maid_Luna: wat? :D
crack a joke! crack a joke!
aw...
Toph is just the best.
I have a dirty mind :D
Wasnt their an epsiode when katara was learning how to blood bend by some old lady?
we need a better explanation
GUILTY
Sorry to here that Pinkies4thWall|sad :(
Apple: yep
And then you're screwed
Apple: Yup.
00,10oh sokka you so funny, life in prision is a great joke
I told her to read the rules, and before i knew it (Very short time) she was getting sad feelings
Maid_Luna: eeyup, now i get it...XD
Ok
so does anyone want to like ... stop him before.. oh snap
NO
:3
/me deals with Maid_Lunas dirty mind~
NOOOOO!!!!
O_O
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUN
NOO
NOOOOOOO!!!!!
SOKA
Pinkies4thWall|sad: again who are you refering to?
ONLY WITH HIS EYES
11,01Pinkies4thWall|sad: Who?
NOOOOOO
WHYYYY
Sumica: He didn't go far enough, though. Execution would have been a much better punchline.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Sokka!!!!
Wah
Maid_Discord: jailbait
0.0
Wrek
RAWRity: Okay, that HAS to be spirit shenanigans.
NOOO NOT TOPH AND SOKKA AND AANG I THINK
Blood bending is OPed
Pinkies4thWall|sad: oh that person..
Shephard
Blood bending like a BOSS
Nerf plz
spy!
eeyup
Tenzin is best detective
She did change her name (even if grudgingly)
CriticKitten: Blood bender overpowered? Nerf metalbending.
00,10not sure of man or woman
05flutter_spin?
Reikim: so far, the explanation is just: "Yakone was born with a rare gift for blood bending."
.-.
Just Mass Effect joke :P
That voice does not fit...
Reikim: Wat, metalbending is tame by comparison
Sumica: I think that is a male....
.....
DUN DUN DUNNN
lol "yay"
05Pinkies4thWall|sad: and we had dorpped it when she had changed her name, but hse had to complain about she not likign the rules
CriticKitten: Only NOW, it can't bend platinum.
Things escalated faster than i've seen higher problems get bad
I hope we get more info on the blood benders plot
Oh dafrn
curses
nooo pic freezing sometime
and the lady survived
00,10brb, cream puffs are done.
dat slap
05had she said "oh my name is in apropriate? i guess i can change it." and then stop there everyoen would be happy
smack
Reikim: It wasn't any more absurd before platinum. Toph was just a badass.
what a dream
What a story Bolin
you enjoy AB so far?
...
Blood bending on the other hand is ALWAYS absurdly overpowered >_>
CriticKitten: It was another joke. Mostly in LoL fandom. *awkwardly shuffles and whistles*
03it's funny
Sumica: -lol you can bake?
Nope
03this girl just blew this dude's desk up LOL
CriticKitten: which is why it's so fucked up and scary.
...
NOOO
anyone else find bloodblending creepy?
nope nope nope nope nope nope
I do
Creepy? Very
03I'm not quite sure what the point of this story is tbh but it's entertaining
05>sumica is a baker
flutter_spin: oh hells yes
blood bending sounds evil o.o
nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope
05>asks if he bakes
VERY KREEPY?
05>redundancy at its finest
Avatar State?
if I was a blood bender I'd make them do the epic get down dance
...Sumica's a baker?
wooooot
Wrek: :P
and now we see aang being bad-ass
Sumica, do you bake? Do you bake bread? :3
YES
OH shit
Summon a giant water creature or something
AND THEN AANG
o-O
Aang used Razor Wind!
Wrek: I'm not saying anything against any of you, but i just wish things hadn't gone where they did
AIRBENDING SLICE!
so it's kind of like BoBoBoBoBoBo
I can't cook! I cook just like Sweetie Belle! :d
nononono
Rule number 1 why you don't mess with Aang.
so like blood bending is the most powerful of all?
shhh
03never wathced that bobobo show, it looked stupid
05Pinkies4thWall|sad: understandable
.-.
You.Do.Not.Fuck.With.him.
NOPE AVATAR
Nope.avi
blood bending is cheap :I
ouchies
O-O
.... OBJECTION! that was a US court when it looks like this show takes pleace in japan or china, it should be the same kind of court from phoenix wright then!
（￣へ￣） .
NOOOO
Y U DO DISS!!!
NOPE
avatar state > blood bending
because you told me nononono
DENIED
what are you? ducky?
YAY
FINISH HIM!
GO
:'(
GO
Huzzah!
owned
03I also love how that small pink girl grows a tail randomly xD
die!
YAY :)
FUN
BAM
And this is proof that Amon is a goddamn energybender AFAIC
But clearly it didn't take.
what?
Oh ya
CriticKitten: eeyup.
she's called Yuri
right?
was?
FUN FACT! Aang was taught Energybending by a giant turtle lion
The only question is, HOW?
is he ... female now?
ironman is female
CriticKitten: I'm still saying spirit shenanigans.
.-.
chig is up?
Koh being the most likely suspect
Nope, you won't.
You know I think there was a goof. In 1 episode of Avatar Ang said he was 115 years old. But in those falshbacks he says he's 40 :O
03dunno
03also wtf
OH HAI
AND THEN
nope
So apparently in Totalbiscuits new wtf is max payne 3 video he gets killed by a pony in the multiplayer.
bring it.
03my tablet hates 720p
:o
It gets worse
:O
03and no sound either
o.o
Amon is a BAMF
o:
03owait
Wrek: would you say sorry if you could? to her?
03wtf
antibending shield activate
Amon just doesn't give a shit
03it works with the speakers but not headphones o_O
Hello every one oh is this avatar legand of korra
Amon is best robot
:"(
Amon is a baws!
Amon is like fuck yo shit
Yes, Amon is HAX
I just want to know so i can get closure
Robots.
ohai cow334!
Amon just beat bloodbending by SHEER FORCE OF WILL
god mode hax
o-o
Not sure if Amon is resistant due to shenanigans, or just that badass.
ouchies
hello Biglaw is this avatar?
who the
RAWRity: NO ONE has ever done that, not even the Avatar
what?
cow334 korra!
Korra, yeah
Like I said, this PROVES Amon is an energybender
nvm
who is that
quick. Air bend up... bend the earth around the crate... do something!
Death :(
Biglaw: awesome
otakon: and that's why Amon is not to be fucked with.
O_O
...or that
He HAS to be an extremely powerful bender.
that cleverness
best fake evar
NO
Reikim: I think it's bc he was so badly burnt by that firebender when he was younger.
03LOL at the fact they keep replaying her blasting kids into the ceiling in slow-motion
O.o
FLAME KICK
pissed
Kaboom
That one guy has voice acted in many games.
wy dose the stream look so pixle
CriticKitten: but that's the thing, he's NOT a bender, he hates benders of ALL kinds.
Amon is evilest pony
o-o
WOO
Dat badass
Thank you,
run away
Earth Wave =D
ice shard ineffective
run run run
who is thar
otakon: He is a bender.
ruuuuuuun!
Wrek?
Apple: Amon
otakon, He might fake that
Oh ok
I guarantee it.
otakon: he SAYS he does. But I get the distinct impression he's not being straightforward.
CriticKitten: an energy bender yeah but goddammit not a bender
RAWRity: maybe
brb again
He's clearly using the Avatar's energybending technique to steal bending powers.
Fuck
This show is just too badass.
otakon: I'm calling it now, Amon can bend, and he started the equalist thing for an alterior motive.
So was the BUCK pic finished or.. still working on it?
That REQUIRES that he's a very powerful bender by default, since not all humans can learn that
wow
flutter_spin: finished, up on Wrek's DA page
RAWRity: Counter: Amon really believes in the movement, he intends to be the last bender alive.
Well think about it
CriticKitten: it also requires he have an ENORMOUS force of will.
neat
......
.-.
Inbound ship
Damn, missed Korra
wierd momment
arkward
I love these credits
and akward
If he's a powerful bender, as energybending requires him to be....then if he eliminates all other benders using this equalist movement, who can stop him?
I missed it
totally
Oh my god
Pinkie vs Amon!
CriticKitten, that's the plan
NOO ITS OVER
noone
WAR!
CriticKitten: The lion turtle could totally stop him.
Why haven't I been watching this show since forever?
03LOOOOOOL she keeps sending that guy flying
her powers grew?
00,10it's ok there is one more ep
Aangmon
That honestly makes me believe that he's definitely a bender.
Did anypony spot Pinkie Pie last night?
03OK this episode is the first one that's made me literally laugh out loud
WHAAA they are allready on there season finnaly
`-`
also only 10 episode?
.-.

Nope
Sumi: Yay :)
Spell-of-Gaming: only a 12 episode first season.
Wait
Can't wait for what they'll have for season 2
ONE HOUR
I want to watch this. I want to watch this! But I can't. Time to sleep, everyone. I'll see you all later.
DANM i need to catch up on this
CrimsonPhoenix: 12

This is going to be. SO. AWESOME!
YES!

03apparently you had me get random rips when RaX already had them

CrimsonPhoenix: and then a 14 episode 2nd season

Good song
Oh man this PMV
Dat take on me -lol

O.O
03heh
I can't wait for next week honestly. The finale's gonna be interesting. Though since season 2 is already confirmed, I'm amazed they're already suggesting a "final showdown"
I thought it was closer to 20 episodes
I tryed to show my brother Spike Bravo he got mad :(
For this PMV, I would actually consider TwiDash.
aha this is awesome
wow
It's usually about 13 episodes per anime series
season 2 gets new main villain?
Ponies47: lol
on me
what the
me on
CriticKitten: I suspect that the end of S1 will reveal there was a bigger baddy behind Amon the whole time.
pony_1773, most likely yes
..........
lolz
o-0
...
o-o
JPEG ARTIFACTS KDSKFl
RAWRity: Man Behind the Man? Or should we say...Spirit Behind the Man?
only reason I know this song is because I heard it in SR2
cow334: My brother is a anti-brony and he really hates em. And he's a total jack(squee)
Reikim: or Face Stealer behind the Man
wait it should have beed fluttershy ad rainbowdash
SR2 IS AWSOME
RAWRity: Or giant turtle lion fish behind the man okay got to stop now
and
Ponies47 on his b-day, post ponies all over his room
Ponies47: is he older than you
well Ponies47 You weren't really helping
The dace stealer again would be amazing
RAWRity: Either that....or he'll be revealed for who he really is, and S2 will have the REAL battle begin across the world.
*face
Reikim: you mean the dragon turtle?
OOH! Perfect idea! Amon is actually working for that monkey spirit we see in the first seson of Avatar who tells Aang to go away.
KEYBOARD TIME
o_o
RAWRity: YES!
DEN DENDENNEND
CrimsonPhoenix: I'm laying off. Not trying to make him watch not talking to him about it NOTHING.
RAWRity: Or maybe he's being manipulated by Ozai's spirit.

Dat Snai;s

I was truly disapointed that this won number in the top ten of the month
MAEGIC
Apple: AND Seth!
number 1**
when she says the student council president (tenshi/angel) is a "normal person with a soul, like us"
So yeah, Zuko had at least 2 kids, and named one of them after his Uncle
Hmm... sounds a bit like the ASDFmovie5 song... weird...
O_O
Angel is NOT pleased
lol
spoilers
cough cough D:
SUCH A FAKE
CrimsonPhoenix: -lol you have to admit it is pretty good :3

03as she said "he"
/me hugs MahBoi777
sounds like toms dog beats
Zuko's daughter is currently reigning as Fire Lord, while Zuko travels the world as a Peace ambassador.
Polydunami: whats up
03but I mean, she's implying that gingers-I mean the regular students don't have s+ouls?
03-+
and seriously Tombstone doesn't have the voice to sing
/me ugs geeky-brony "Geeks!"
Ponies47: yay
no it not trixie
Biglaw: looked like Twisp combined with Smarty Pants
seems legit
Polydunami is sleepy
Maid_Luna: halo

Pinecone?
I cannot wait until next week. :(
Dat Lyra
RAWRity: wait, he had a daughter too? God I hope she doesn't take after Azula
SPAAAAAAAACE FACE!
RAWRity: wait so zuko is still alive

Wut is that...
MahBoi777: trixs pmv hu
cow334: according to the extra material on Nick.com, Zuko is still alive, yes.
slightly disturbing
Ponies47: Still sad because Beifong. ;_;
What was that fluffy thing
O.O
ACS13123: that is Flufflepuff, the fluffy pony
03yeah
geeky-brony: eeeeeyup
O_O
OMG
Maid_Luna: oki doki loki
CriticKitten: dawww :<
Biglaw: Flufflepuff the super fluffy pony
Flufflepuff is cute as hell.

Biglaw, it's Fluffy
ACS13123: fanon
mmmmmmagic *snort snort*
dat Derpy
RAWRity: awesome I'm going to get cought up with the serious tommorow
Derpy?
because his punishments were harsher, yurippe deduced this.
D'awwwww
awwww
DERPY NO!!!!!!!!!!!!
ded
scootaloo scootscootaloo
chicken in the skie?
DERPY
YAY
nooooo derpy
she's okay!
Ponies47: Her badassery was cut down in its prime. 'taint fair. ;_;
He reigned as Firelord for many years, but eventually left the throne to his daughter. Apparently his son, on the other hand, took up becoming General of the United Forces.
03you're. missing my obvious question
NOOO
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TRIXIE
derpy nooo!
Oh yeah
Which is fitting considering his namesake.
Hm..
if it was a NPC, the punishments would be bland
OSHIT
03is Yurippe saying that the "regular students" don't have souls?
NOOO DERPY
I missed Seth...
best song
SHE DIED
Yay!
RAWRity: how do you KNOW all this?
BOO
11,01Aww.
/me opens his eyes
I never miss Seth :|
Ok my stream is like 10 - 15 sec behind you guy's :'(
11,01Not Yaplap.
so umm you know that time when you go back to school and somone ask what you did over the summer?......
.-.
Ninjazz: I knew this would get you back :D
No Solrac lol
hey Ninjazz!
otakon: Avatar Wiki?
Ponies47: that's standard, your fine
00,10screw yaplap
Hey Ninjazz ;)
/me sing along
Hey, guys.
RAWRity: that will be funny if he ends up being like his uncle
BonBon never heard of you
otakon: Nick.com has a "discover republic city" interactive thing that offers a lot of extra info and backstory on the series.
Sumica: he's funny in SOME cases
either lost it or don't behave rebelliously
RAWRity: ah
aaaaand big crown thingy...
Claps Hands
...
Please, no Yaplap
03well they all go to those concerts
one of the SSS "loses their soul" in a later episode
is that fluttershy?
Is this original?
lol
HEY look she is now a unnicorn
Where the heck is SilverScreen!?
00,10clearly I have never seen that case
It's also how I learned that Tenzin is the only one of Aang's children who is an Airbender.
DER{U!
dammit
I saw Derpy

/me clops hooves

:yaoming:
whoa
God, what u guys got against Solrac?!
Sumica: is this the original?
yes
00,10yeah
RAWRity: wait... he's the ONLY Airbender? out of three kids? that does not bode well...
flying boat!
poooooooony
.-.
Eeyup
H to the Husky Husky.

Yaplap?
Maid_Luna: so how are you
oshit
YAY!
Oh my
BonBon still doesn't know who she is.
Dan vs
Squee
yay dan vs!
PONY IS SAID SO MANY TIMES IN THIS SONG! :D
wait
muted
YES!!!!
no sound....
otakon: Yeah, though it's noteworthy that bending isn't apparently genetic
TOO LOUD
Dan vs. Rarity.
Dan vs. Speakers
TOO LOUd, AHHHHHHHHHHH
Sumica: sound?
Dan vs... Audio?
DAN
Where be sound?
no sound?
No sound
00,10I think my sound just craped out
muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuute
SOOOUNNNND
11,01Dan Vs. Silence.
dat yay
Yes, Dan Vs Audio
hmm
nope, I heard a yay
Looks like I came just in time. I've really come to love this show.
elsie lol
yay works
Sumica: why so happy?
Dammit, turn that volume down :|
NO SOUND
SOUND! THERE IS LOTS OF IT! .... NOT!
O_O
CriticKitten: as much as I figured, which means that there are airbenders out there just waiting to be taught
Sumica: YA DONT SAY?!
yay
GIMME A SEC\
NO SOUND
otakon: that's why they have the Air Acolytes. Bending is passed onto children depending on hwo spiritual the society they are born into is. Thus, they recruit non-benders to live as the Air nomads did, in the hopes that they will give birth to Airbenders.
Dun......dun DUN
The other sounds work, its the player that seems to ahve derped
cmon years of lip reading dont fail me now! >:3
AAAUUUUUDDDDIIIIOOOOO
You see, he hates sound
we hear the sound board Sumica
and buffer
This... This is the sound of pure silence
NO sound :(
00,10damaged file it seems
Dan is only speaking with Windows Sounds
00,10it's not a sound board
Sumica: did you cut off the stream?
Seems legit.
Crap no lips >:3
O-O
DAT GRANNY

MahBoi777: how r u

....nope, still not over Beifong. ;_;
Spell-of-Gaming: LOGIC!
i guess dan's voice liked bananas
Back. I refereshed.
geeky-brony: good!
MahBoi777: good
Ponies47: doesn't matter, Dan is damaged
00,10files are fubared it seems
geeky-brony: u?
Not fubared!
sumica #spikebigno
Sumica: crap that sucks man, hope your other files are okay
and now my stream isn't working :<
I blame the DRM.
CriticKitten: She will find a way -lol I can feel it.
Ponies47: it's dead atm
Ponies47, the stream is turned off for now
Fill in the Blank: Maid_Luna Hugs _________
He's dead, Jim.
Error 404: Dan not found
MahBoi777: sick feeling prob to much soda
Funfact: The whole connection between spirituality and bending meant that, when the Air nomads were around, every child born into the airbending monks was an Airbender, no exceptions.
00,10they are fine but nitt showed them all friday
O thanks :P
Maid_Luna: ...everypony?
RAWRity: so, way of life thing huh?
dan vs STREEEEEAAAAAAM
11,01Just that one ep is bad Sumica?
00,10both of the last two eps
Maid_Luna hugs Maid_Celestia :3
00,10every thing else is fine
Maid_Luna: Is it......Iron_Edge?? =D Maid_Luna hugs Iron_Edge? -lol
Iron_Edge: Hopefully her badassery extends past her bending. Though I admit I was surprised that the writers picked Beifong to take the fall this ep. I didn't think they'd claim the child of Toph so early.
otakon: eeyup. It's about the spirituality of the society the child is born into. Thus why they have the non-benders living on Air Temple Island in Korra.
Fill in the Blank: Rainbow Dash is ________
11,01Maid hug!
/me 11,01hugs maids
Rainbow Dash is Too mainstream.
Maid_Luna: a badass
RAWRity: so wait... does that mean Bo Lin and what's his name are really biological brothers?
Dan now wages war against Technology.... again, and internet providers :)
awesome.
... I can't decide between awesome and obnoxious :3
:S
otakon: eeyup.
00,10well damn.
Red_Pegasus|Redspy: bloody hipsters
11,01Rainbow Dash is my favorite pony.
CriticKitten: Very true -lol she probably has awesome hand to hand fihgting skills or is a wep expert.
could it be the video player?
Maid_Discord: I have noticed! :p
Rainbow Dash is loyal.
Rainbow Dash is... Nevermind...
Sumica: Shall we watch the youtube?
hurr
Iron_Edge: I hope so. I want to see her utilized more in the series, it'd be such a shame if she was removed now.
/me Maid hugs as well :3
Last Fill in the blank: AppleJack reminds me of _____________

AppleJack reminds me of Elvis.
I sweae zuko son sounds alot of the same
I can dig it
Funfact: Republic City actually formed from a Fire Nation colony where the Fire nation citizens had comingled with the Earth Kindom people, and it was not uncommon to have Earth and Fire benders born to the same parents. Thus how Bolin and Mako came about.

Wait...

This is a very good replacement for nichijou when nichijou is over
is she waiting on the sea ponies?
This is, amazingly, part of a Genre in anime I call the Clueless Invader genre-- where someone-thing-idiot assumes they can easily take over Earth-- and is disabused.
In squid Clop means "Squid" :D
like how FMA intros and outros sounds like everything else? lol

My Macbook is making the fan sound... ALL the TIME

FairysHuff: I know a bit?

geeky-brony: I think Mount and Musket I has no idea :P
Irish_Pony: lol it looks bloody epic
FairysHuff: thats a pretty decent start but for a little more, you could get this one. Ive heard many things about this mic. http://www.bluemic.com/yeti/#/desc/

Chat's derping 6_9
Kitteh_Luna: u a fan of octiva
geeky-brony: I love her!I ship DJ Pon3 and Octavia :D
FairysHuff: i think it should be fine without a doubt, condensors are the way to go because they are easier to handle
Kitteh_Luna: wub u <3
Kitteh_Luna: that sems to be a pop ship .
oni_link: What do you mean easier to handle? I'm scientifically curious ^_^
Irish_Pony: I wub you too Sweetheart <3

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiyPRqP5glY&feature=relmfu awseom viloin stuf
BroKnee: I love her,but I'm more into pop that Classical :$
FairysHuff: Dynamic mics are pretty much the same stuff seen in studios BUT, they cant be taken with you on the road as easily. they have their own power supply, and other equipment. and theyre more fragile.
geeky-brony: wanna learn violin xD
Kitteh_Luna Classical has been my fav kind of music my whole life ^.^
Kitteh_Luna: i asked if you wer still drailing for ppl here is cuz i waned a pic of geeky and octiva hanging out lisng to muisc

Photo_Finish: Lad, you got to hear me out...
Irish_Pony: life is torture
^
Irish_Pony: WHAT?What do you wanna say??? :'(
well then...
xmasskills It just depends how you spend it
/me Hugs BroKnee
/me backs away from all the drama
BroKnee: nope life finds a way to fuck your shit up nomatter what you do
^
/me Hugs Photo_Finish <3
xmasskills, especially if you do nothing.
exactly
cant win.
xmasskills It all depends how you spend it :p
BroKnee: tell me something that cant be fucked up
anything at all
and ill take what i said back
xmasskills Death, no one can fuck up dieing
Irish_Pony: Left?REALLY?? *Sobs Louder*
Photo_Finish: Do you think I wanted this? I cant really explain you'll just have to wait until GilDash comes back on
13this sentence is true
oni_link I'll gnaw at the ankles of big business!
13the sentence above is false
BroKnee, thats Inherently fucked up.
WallDive depends how you view it ^.^
oshi
BroKnee: yes doctors can extend your life and have revived people who died for some time therfore they fucked up death
soo
next
Dat1FuglyMuffin: hi hoof! /) so glad you got the refference
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJY6T2MdBmI&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&feature=mh_lolz
Irish_Pony: We'll have to wait til then!This is OVER until we see Gildash!
BroKnee, considering I've viewed it through people taking their own lives and through others losing it through the negligence of others, yes I do view it like that. >.>
xmasskills No, they didn't fuck it up, they simnply avoided it
13remembers me of a time, where the teachers at school gave paradoxes OR extremey hard, near paradoxic questions to students, if they misbehave
anyway, I dont want tot talk about death on Father's Day.
Photo_Finish: Please, just remain calm...Im going through a lot right now....
WallDives well, I've seen that too, but I still think entirely differently
oni_link: Yeah! (\ *shockwave crashes*
I love the weather over here. Just 5 minutes ago, it was adequate, and now it's pouring down.
Dat1FuglyMuffin: lmao noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
BroKnee: someone dies they revive them they are now a vegatable because they were dead and now have brain damage they died but came back to life and are living albeit brain dead but they live after they died so death got fucked up
My GrandFather Died 4 months ago.He was the only Father I had left :'(
right, I dont have to deal with this here, today.
xmasskills, no matter how you look at it, everything dies, always been that way, allways will be
Today,I'll stand proud and Tall!To show him my respect for him!
BroKnee: but some things have been brought back from death even if they will die again therfore death got fucked up
soo next thing that cant be fucked up
xmasskills no, because it will just die again, death was postponed
8bit Winter Wrap Up? I say yay! :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgKuV8XAx78&feature=plcp
When you die,you're heart does too.Death is followed by many Dead hearts :(
BroKnee: yea it was postponed its like i want to die here is my time im dead oh wait here come doctors and bring me back to life fucking shit up
death got messed up
with VOCALS??? What is this witchcraft oni_link?
even if only for one instance but death was messed up
You can't skip Death or it'll go after you.
Dat1FuglyMuffin: the uploader is beast, this was a request of mine :)
xmasskills If you are brought back to life, then it obviously wasn't your time, either way, you WILL die
Now,I'm really leaving,bye! :)
Photo_Finish: im not saying skipping death im saying even death can be fucked up
xmasskills: Everything in Life is Fucked up,everything sweetheart.
xmasskills Not fucked up, postponed untill necessary
BroKnee: but people have DIED for a while then were brought BACK from death therfore it was temporaraly messed up proving even death can be messed up
BroKnee: no no your logic is stupid
you already died
it was your time
Logic can't be stupid, only the one who does not understand it
Wrek Phase?
I"MLEAVINGBYE
Bye Photo_Finish <3
Bye Photo_Finish
BroKnee: well then you cant understand my logic and you are what your logic and statement dictate you to be
xmasskills, let me put it this way, name ONE thing that CAN'T die
Phase4: You gonna stream? or something :p
BroKnee: the cells from that one woman that are still alive today even if she passed away years ago
xmasskills Who?
BroKnee: Everything must eventually come to an end, for without an end, there can be no peace.

oni_link: He wants you all to behave I guess. XD
xmasskills Also, you can't always trust the news, it is made of desperate writers who will stab their friends in the back just to become popular and get a promotion, not the kind of people anyone should trust
Vordox: ill be good :D

Phase4: YOU ARE SO FUCKING CLOSE to Kernal
00,02nah
xmasskills: the fact that you said you were too young to know of scooby doo?
I feel like oyu are
00,02it passed at about 400KM
00,02plenty of space
xmasskills The cells are being artificially produced, the original cells HAVE died, the only reason that the artificial cells don't is because they aren't really alive, they just recreate exactly what would happen to a regualr human cell, which is why they are so widely used in research
This song
oni_link: you get nothing cause i dont give a fuck
Yay song
Gives me goosebumps, the vid does
00,02i'ma try record again
00,02should have started when i started
00,02actualy it claims to be recording
Phase4 is that game free?
xmasskills: http://fim.413chan.net/oatmeal/src/130658831949-DerpShrug.jpg
Looks fun
BroKnee: WOW it took you that long to find a single flaw and stretch it into that eyesore of a text wall gratz you have made me think less of you
00,02BroKnee, version .13 is
00,02can anyone here record the stream?
VLC
oni_link: let me get a response to that one sec
00,02oh awesome
I could try real quick to see if it comes out good Phase4
00,02this thing has allmost 2 full tanks
00,02plus the one on the lander
xmasskills I hope I have :3, so long as I can prove to you that not everything is possible to be 'fucked up", stop being so pessimistic
Phase4: /)
00,02Dark_Horst, (\
Why does everyone confuse me for Dark_Horst
00,02it looks like my pony is suspicious of the rocket now
00,02oh derp
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, (\
lol
00,02tab fails
00,02oni_link, is it working?
=/
let me cut the clip and see
00,02i'ma start trying to land now
frame rate is a bit lower but sound and vid is good
im recording now Phase4
BroKnee: you still havent proved anything death can still be messed up since it can be postponed it is inevitable but you can change when it happens therfore it can in fact be FUCKED UP so yea also im not pessimistic i just like thinking in a pessemistic way you know the phrase plan for the worst and hope for the best i think like that
00,02k
Hello
ARG... couldn't find a fitting blank vector, no i actually have to try and make the hair myself :/... anyway, I'm afk drawing
hmm fight a text wall with a text wall
hey oni_link srry it took some time i had to slap BroKnee with text here is my respons to your shrug http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m59so6fXMM1qfgn2xo1_500.png
xmasskills: lol
xmasskills XD
lmao i have nothing to say to that. fabulous-ness established :D
Dark_Horst: lol at what exactly i like to know what it is im doing thats funny so i can do more of it
oni_link: yes now the world knows im fabulous
xmasskill only pessimistic thinkers use that phrase, people like me say Meh, what happens, happens, optimistic people think "Everything is good in every way" so, and no, death can't be fucked up, just because something can simnply be postponed because it wasn't meant to happen yet doesn't mean that its "fucked up"
xmasskills: .... im Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG NOT DARK_HORST
omg astronaut still screaming?
one of them calmed down
lol thank god
mario_pony only 1 xD the other 2 are using all the Oxygen
00,02allmost time for the decent
lol
lol target : mun :D
ok wth are you guys talking about
pony is not amused with landing
Goood morning~
omg a Drum and Bass track? Phase4, this is relevant to my interests!
Its not fucking up death, its fucking up your way of things, death wasnt fucked up, the thought of "I hope I die" was fucked up
morning Starflash
00,02mun orbit achived
yess
00,02now...
00,02how to do this
BroKnee: you wanted death to come to you it was fucked up because someone prevented it from happening it was fucked up
XD
And I'm argueing about it because I said people "like me" not "me"
00,02i have bucketloads of fuel
ah, so quiet here this morning.
00,02could probably abort and head to minmus instead
BroKnee: im done slaping you with my superior text so http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m57r7dh1PN1rpcorwo1_500.jpg
Death=postponed, your thought=fucked up
00,02anyway, onward to mun
oh well, at least we have Phase4 firing rockets & stuff.
BroKnee: that picture is redundant seeing as i have been insulting you throught this entire conversation
Spacecore comes out of nowhere and hits your spaceship out of orbit
xmasskills You've been insulting me?
xmasskills I'm to possitive to see them I guess
Flash doesn't like me cause it glitches alot
I'm glad my inkscape doesnt hate me because I've been on it alot
lol now the middle one started freaking out again
friggin IDIOTS!
xmasskills I'm not stupid, I'm simply not pessimistic and don't view your words in a negative manner
rocket froze =/
tooo the mooooooon~
well everypony i am going to visit my dad soon
00,02YES
the mun ineed
XD dat steam
00,02i can use the rockets to do most of the slowing
00,02then dump em
srry i got disconnected
how are you gonna land? ocean?
xmasskills Also, I don't see how your can so hypocritically call me stupid, when you also have not bothered to stop the conversation until this point in time
you*
oni_link obviously, where else would he land on the moon?
on LAND?
Lolno
dat song O.o
BroKnee: i never said i wasnt stupid i just said you were stupid to be hypocritical i would have to have said i wasnt stupid
Dat1FuglyMuffin: i was thinking ahead and trying to think of where he would land back on earth
lmao
oh...
lol
but that was funny either way :D
Thats not true, do you know the deffinition of a hypocrite?
BroKnee: in truth in keeping this conversation going because i enjoy debating things and you are a perfect candidate who wont change their stance on something and wants to have the last word in the conversation
the friday movie night banner wont stop flashing on my screen haha
people fighting makes me happy trolololololo jk
xmasskills For me its not about having the last words, its about trying to get people to actualy look at the world and see the beauty behind it, I couldn't care LESS about who gets the last damned words
oh you guys :)
BroKnee: knowing the definition of hyocrite only tells you that it means indulging in hypocricy you would have to look up hypocricy which i dont want to do
oh gawd
Here I'll tell you then
00,02PERFECT
Phase4 left earth without the bananas?
00,02SHIT
00,02gona have to go back and get them
crap i just had a blackout for a second.. scared me like hell
Phase4: get what?
00,02i dont knwo
well the astronauts are calming down
00,02Dark_Horst, the bananas
BroKnee: ahahahaha beauty in the world thats a laugh ahaha there is some beauty in this world but it is over shadowed by all the uglyness that humanity has brought upon it
goddamit, you flew to the moon IWHTOUT BANANNAS?
BroKnee: wait im not done laughing AHAHAHA "beauty" he says ahahaha
Hypocrisy is the state of pretending to have virtues, moral or religious beliefs, principles, etc., that one does not actually have, and you calling me stupid infers that you are claiming to be more intelligent than I, but if you are calling me stupid for not geting a point then that makes you a hypocrite for not sooner stoping the conversation
Hi Everypony. How is everyone doi-....What is this?
Good afternoon everypony :)
now they just have a creepy smile on their faces
hello killerpony7733.
hi killerpony7733
hello killerpony7733
hi killerpony7733 ans Aircrafter
hey thar killerpony7733.
NO I SAID HI FIRST
hi Aircrafter
hello Aircrafter
00,02i have no clue how far away the ground is
There you go again with the pessimism
Oh boy so many pings :D
00,02last time i landed that counter was off by 2.5 Km
BroKnee: here is the actual definition of hypocrite
xmasskills1: say, what is the foal point of this heated discussion you two are leading?
BroKnee: Noun:	A person who indulges in hypocrisy.
Now...Could anypony explain what this is?
Phase4: ohhh am i seeing a sprite of your OC? :O
00,02:3
xmasskills1: *focal
killerpony7733: bro chill we just said hi
00,02oh whoops
i wanna make an oc pony :(
00,02i started climbing
xmasskills yes, and you did just that by claiming I was "stupid"
oh no
Moo'
Its a moon landing simulator?
cow334: hey i just woke up i kinda need to wake up a bit ;)
00,02space program simulator
Oh, I see. Thanks Phase4.
omg i heard the steam notification and checked my steam XD
Dark_Horst: at first it was a conversation in which i said there is nothing in this world that can not be fucked up and BroKnee said death was one and i told him or her why i thought i could be then it turned into a personall assault of morals
or so and such
transfooooooooorm!!!!!!!!
interesting
BroKnee: now tell me what is hypocricy
Oh boy this song <3
xmasskills If I am personaly assaulting you in any way I'm so dearly sorry, I don't mean to be
Fireflies :3
<3
is it?
Phase4, how's the space program?
nope
Oh
XD
BroKnee: it's amazing how people take things as a personal at times when you aren't even trying
I thought it actually was :(
gah! my laptop is sooo hot
BroKnee: your saying im a hypocrite and that is saying that my morals are off so you my good man have insulted me
oni_link: get something to cool it or turn it off
BroKnee xmasskills1 so, did one of you two at any time in the past log in here with the nick monfang?
00,02its going well
man i
Dark_Horst: nope
killerpony7733: the fans suck on this thing and I'm recording Phase4's landing
Phase4: eeyup
xmasskills I told you of this already; Hypocrisy is the state of pretending to have virtues, moral or religious beliefs, principles, etc., that one does not actually have. Since you claimed I was stupid for continueing with the conversation you claim to have higher intelegence even though you, yourself, were continueing it as well
oops
oni_link: yeah this laptop i'm using can get quite hot but it kinda balances a bit out
i am so tired but i want to see Phase4 land back on earth
Phase Pony has litle faith in that rocket XD
BroKnee: intelligence is neither a virtue nor a moral. you're using hypocrisy wrong
Cant even see it, stupid dark side of te moon
BroKnee: oh so now your saying im calling you stupid when i am not smart i see insulting me that way you sly dog you just kidding i could care less of what you think about my intelegence
killerpony7733: well i have the lava hot edition of the macbook
00,02YES
00,02I DID IT
xmasskillsxmasskills I don't know if you noticed the ect. or if you just don't know what it means
BroKnee: i think you are closed minded my dear freind
MUUUUN!
I think this is a completely moot discussion.
Wooo!!
oni_link: thats just stupid that the fans weren't designed to be efficient
dayum Phase4!
Phase4: congrats :)
now to go back to earth
lol screen
00,02I'M ON MUN
00,02:3
But Noo Luna...
DESKTOP LUNA! :P
Wooo!
Now to find luna?
Phase4: now get back to earth
Grats Phase4 ^-^ /)
one does not simply find luna
killerpony7733: yeah it sucks lol
xmasskills1: kernal*
Phase4: mission accomplished. now get home B)
no the first step is to plant a flag!
:D
Now go home, get the bananas, and come back
yaay~
WOONA :)
aww yeah luna!
xD Luna, of course
Ha ha! The Luna has been doubled!
Whoot...
Is there something you haven't told us Luna...?
huzzah!
00,02time to take off :3
I'll brb
:D
BroKnee: also i wasnt claiming you were stupid for continuing the conversation i think your stupid just because you really are
Phase4: now you only need nightmare moon. then its a moonpartx
moon party!
BroKnee: ill be waiting to further rustle your jimmies
Now to Kerbal!
Saved Luna!
Yup. This definitely is a moot arguement.
^
Yeah, your stuck out there forever, Houston out.
lmao ^
oni_link: on my currently bucked laptop thats a over average one has one fan not moving and one moving the one that moves handles quite well and keeps a moderate temp though the non working side will eventually build up some heat though a cooling pad helps against that
oh by the way 1/3 of kerbal now thinks it's was recorded in a Studio ni the outback
Okay, I'm back
Got enough fuel to slingshot back to Kerbal, Phase4 ?
:)
giant woona
so, what are the odds his fuel will run out and he'll be lost i the vast blackness of space?
00,02seem to have enough
killerpony7733: i need to buy a cooling station
00,02need to escape mun then i can just slow and fall
D:
sweet
So big...
Phase4: what's the yellow orbit there?
oni_link: i have a relatively cheap but good enough cooling pad
Dark_Horst: enjoying the show of text that is a stupid argument
killerpony7733: how much did you get it fo?
00,02yellow is my future orbit around kerbin
*For
xmasskills1: popcorn entertainment
00,02shit, i might not have enough
xmasskills Would you like to call it even? My fingers are becoming sore from typing
Poor Earth, raped of its own friggin name
uh i'd say 30 or 40 bucks-+
?*
Phase4: If you don't get back to Kerbal...You're killing off Lunaaaaa"
killerpony7733: usb powered?
LAWL
oni_link: yeah
Don't be Happy Luna XD
00,02think i'm going to be stuck in kerbin orbit
BroKnee: oh no i can continue all night if i so desired i hope your fingers bleed trying to win a conversation that you could never win or you can forfeit and take the loss like a man
killerpony7733: sounds good :)
Phase4 Man, that sucks
xmasskills No offence when
No you can do it!
....Luna would be on the screen. SHE WOULD BE, YOU SICK BASTARD. ( lol jk i love u )
Just keep slingshotting!
Now if you remembered the bananas, the ship could run on potassium
lol ^
YOU LIKE mmmmmmm BANNANAS!
Bananas are good. I like bananas.
BroKnee: i take everything you say in offence so i can further this stupid argument
oni_link: yeah its maybe not the greatest or anything but it cools the underside of the laptop extremely well though the front side still can build up heat though :$
Kammerjunk: IKR?
00,02YES
You are a ~beeyetch~ that likes mmm bannanas?
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT!
WOO WOO
HERE COMES LUNA!
Crash into North... Kerbia?
killerpony7733: as long as this thing can keep my approx. area fairly cool then its all good. where did you get it?
xmasskills I mean no offence when I tell you thins, but....or we could both be the mature ones and walk away from this and never converse again
this*
thats one long slingshot
Oh god... I have to redraw all the vector lines in Paint >.<
come on, step it up!
Falling into orbit has to be friggin scary
they're gonna drown!!
Wait.... Whats going on here? Do we haz fight?
oni_link: i got it for a store in my country and i doubt the chain store is in your local country
Dat1FuglyMuffin: of course
I hate getting involved in stupid arguments, but I have to agree that attempting to continue an arguement for the sake of cheap laughs is very immature.
oni_link: where are you from?
BroKnee: i actually use this type of conversation as entertainment soo sure lets drop this i hope to converse with you later even you provide a good person to rustle jimmies
Phasr!
killerpony7733: US
/me sighs.
Phase4: stop pushing forward your going to crash in the ocean =/
/me sighs
Phase4: are your jimmies thouroghly rustled
lol
hey guys
/me hugs Twi_Fi and WallDives
Alright, Can anyone tell me what xmasskills1 and BroKnee are arguing about like a married couple?
oni_link: lol don't i'm afraid i can't point you to a store with this cooling pad
oh hey there Twi_Fi , I didn't know it was you
idk why but thats funny

xmasskills I would preffer to not get into arguments with people who begin to insult me over it, but if you so insist it, then I might have to figure a way to mute you ^-^ again, no offence
BroKnee: is also conversing of his own accord

Congratulations Phase! You beat the game!

WallDives: Steak jokes? :S
killerpony7733: wy run I don't even know what is going on
GilDash, burned + cow
Phase4 you should already have it, change the level when you start the server
Phase4: It's just choosing it in the lobby
Petrified_Discord: tl;dr
WallDives: I'm not even a big fan of steak... OH! :D
lol
Ohai stream
WallDives: that would make burgers
i guess
Stream, hows ur sex life?
cow334: run just run you will only get yourself in something you may not like boyo
but I liek steak more.
cow334: Teasing with me. Most ponies around here would say that's a bad move. ;)
i think i'll play some game for a bit... then go to bed... had a long night
:D
good morrning

hey rdibp

00,02stream working?

Phase4: Aye.
Phase4 is streaming
eeyup
GilDash: Well the fact that i don't even no what you mean or am i messing with you I'm not so eh i dunno now what to do from this point all i said is that i wub u
Wait, I thought you used Linux.
Virtual Box?
00,02Kammerjunk, i do
inception
killerpony7733: 6_9?
cow334: Tee hee. You're so cute. ;)
youdawg heard you like bronystate
00,02virtualbox is a little slow
Aha.
:|?
No, stream lags a few seconds
Ever wondered why single-player game recordings are called "let's play"s but multiplayer game recordings are called "commentaries"? :O
rdibp: so hes sreamed while he streamed?
GilDash: silly filly you dont know how i look like ;)
im gonna shot everyone... zombies and survivors... im an equal opportunity killer
GilDash stop toying with cow334 you'll melt his brain :D
sreamed? :D
00,02how do i get the map again?
d3rb: lol yup my brain are melted
i want L4D2 soooo bad :(
cow334: Silly filly, it doesn't matter. I love everypony. ;)
I wonder... I'm going to play this on my xbox at the same place your at
00,02what map is it in the lobby
Phase4, you want me to set up the map?
GilDash: yeah so do i ;) willy filly
Phase4 isnt it a part of NoMercy?
00,02Midnight_Tempest, sure
cow334: Yes, but my motto is "Lovin' and tolerating... with an emphasis on lovin'." ;)
Phase4: ok, so what style of game we gonna do? Campaign?
gotta practice what ytou preach
Ohai Espeon
GIBSFEST!
Phase4 I'm red baron
dooooooooooooo DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO dooooooooooooooooooooo
d3rb: Well, are you offering to stand in his place now? ;)
GilDash: I wub every one but i dont go off that love and tollerate refrence any more
00,02Midnight_Tempest, campaign
cow334: yeah but GilDash loves everypony in some way i think you don't want to tread on :$
:D no way not getting involed in this, i'll just enjoying sittng on the side with some popcorn
Got full party yet Phase4 ?
cow334: If you'll notice, I made some adjustment to it. You might want to read it more closely. ;)
"Love and tolerate" is an odd term. Sure, I have no problem tolerating everyone no matter their affinity for throwing insults at me, but that doesn't mean I have to like them, let alone love them.
00,02games full
00,02that did not take long
Damnit. D:
:'(
Sit, laugh, and make funny commentary...
oh, the L4D1 maps
Kammerjunk: Yup. Tolerate =/= Accept
Kammerjunk: respect and tolerate?
Well guess the one who wanted to play L4D2 to be played, ans suggested it, gets kciked out XD
Vordox I didn't get in eather :(
Lil_B|Drawing: Meh it's fine, next time. :)
Where did the phrase "love and tolerate" even come from? :/
Bill!
Bill is best, Phase4 !
Vordox next time L4D2... NEXT TIME!
Petrified_Discord: No clue. Certainly isn't a phrase used in the show.
Petrified_Discord: *That* place...
Grabbin
Oy Phase4 ! You can actually play Versus Campaign
GilDash: well I newst to do the love and tollerate thing but untill i realized that certaint people need to be put in there place cause they will never stop if you just love and tollerate them but not to you guys I wouldnt get yall mad just mess with yall and that is all
pills
That way 8 people can play. :)
certain
GilDash: Oooooooooooh my...
00,02Vordox, i want to play campaign
wee
oni_link: That would certainly work better.
into the game we go
Ahhh walls of text!
Versus campaign and Normal campaign are the same
yaay
Kammerjunk: i live by that, and it works
cow334: Oh, well, I love messin' with ponies too. ;)
Get pistol, troll team with witch.
i think he wants to actually finish the campeign
Petrified_Discord: Mmm hmm. :D
GilDash: awesome it can be pretty fun sometimes but i make sure not to go to far when I'm
cow334: I tend to push the limits. It can get rather messy. ;)
I remember the Expert difficulty being a piece of lie in the L4D beta.
omg voices!!!!!!
Your team will die, Phase4 XD
Pony tags!

6 in the morning is best time for not-sleep
Midnight_Tempest:

Don't let him follow you! LET HIM EXPLORE TO LEARN, It's called "Respecting the player" urgh
cow334: Everywhich way and then some. ;)
if Midnight_Tempest sees a firework display.. he will be in shock xD
GilDash: is the master of innuendo
GilDash: cool
GOD DAMNIT NINTENDO "Shigeru Myamoto is interrested in making a unique FPS, but he has no time"

Vordox: only lead when they ask for help :)

Lil_B|Drawing: What a shame.
And then tey all leave him...nice... :P
cow334: I prefer, hot. ;)
lol
Thats a daym shame
you know they should make a zombie game where the main campaign is you being a zombie
cow334: oh boy keep being curious and you go down the path of sin
GilDash: got it
lol
Zoey!
Kammerjunk someone else should take over his current project... I don't like FPS that much, but i would so like to see an FPS by him XD
killerpony7733: i don't i am doing any thing wrong
I am a muffin.
cow334: is going to be corrupted :D
cow334: Yes, this will end in two ways. You'll either hate me, or you'll "love" me. ;)
Midnight has gone Crazy
cow334: what GilDash said
Lil_B|Drawing: I'm all for that. I don't even play Nintendo.
you know they should make a zombie game where the main campaign is you being a zombie
Dark_Horst: How can you tell the difference? :D
Phase4: You can push people off zombies with melee button, except Big Things.
Melee@222
I think I have a Wii somewhere, actually. Not sure where, though.
alexxm: never underestimate modders
Maybe it's in the closet.

GilDash: ehh i guess I'm still going to love you whohoo other then all of this outta the way I REGRET NOTHING LET LE um i dunno BEGIN
Midnight_Tempest: alright your not crazy... your just insane
Fluttershy? But Pinkie is the one with gypsy magic.
Lawll Fluttershy Witch

Midnight_Tempest: do you have the Raptor Skin Mod?

Petrified_Discord: Yes, and I cant tell the difference
GilDash: i'll wait here and await reaction

Petrified_Discord: only a fool wouldn't see through GilDashes little show :D
GilDash: Naw, I used a time marker to go to 9:48
Kammerjunk: I'd have to look at the Wikia again. Last I saw, it was Snowflake.
little show, seems like a full scale production
Phase4: tell them to try Camtasia
Yeah, Fraps hates everyones harddisk.
13ohai dere
d3rb: oh i may have understated that
:$
lol
Petrified_Discord: Okay, I'll check it again. Stupid ads might've messed it up.
Hi Lighty
Man, fuck ads

of course Midnight would alert the horde
Petrified_Discord: they get me all the time
14Lighty :3
/me has Adblock
HAHAHAHA fuck you ads
<3 adblock
Petrified_Discord: hi hoof /)
Wow
[22:12:01] <Lighty> [15:55:52] this sentence is true
[22:12:01] <Lighty> [15:55:58] the sentence above is false
[22:12:01] <Lighty> [15:56:54] remembers me of a time, where the teachers at school gave paradoxes OR extremey hard, near paradoxic questions to students, if they misbehave
oni_link: (\ highest of hooves
Both sentences are true
umad?
Kandarihu|BuddyBear: I've seen a lot of names. Last time I remember, the room I was in settled on either Big McLargehuge or Bold Bigflank.
sweet

Midnight_Tempest: if youre the one recording, try Camtasia

Well, the Wikia is still calling him Snowflake.
Francis doesn't give a hoof how bad Louis is.
of course Midnight_Tempest has a skin for everything
Petrified_Discord: :O

Kandarihu|BuddyBear i thought he was called 'roid rage

alexxm: not for me

Stop it Louis!
omg
/me shuffles
Frankly, I don't like names that wouldn't make sense for parents to give their children.
Midnight_Tempest reminds me of my TF2. Last time I checked, I had about 170 mods spread throughout skins and sounds.
You need to restart the game to make Spray works :P
Phase4: After restart it works
Reconnect to the server*
Won't it work if you just proceed to the next level.
hey Rainbow_XAX
Phase4: It's fine, I made it "legit"
Phase4: God darnit Phase. :P
Hai d3rb
how are ya?
Even though there are examples of the exact thing happening among the Mane 6
I'm fine thanks. Yourself?
Vordox whats your name on steam?
pretty good man
Lil_B|Drawing: TheRealVordox, why?
Kandarihu|BuddyBear: I think Bold Bigflank makes perfect sense.
hehe hey do you guys know this new game lolipop chainsaw?
Vordox so i can add you as a friend >: D
Snowflake is very ironic, though.
I DO NOT DESERVE THIS
the one with tara strong as a voice actor Commander_Sheperd ?
yes !!
hello everypony
Vordox You do, and you will like it!
yes i know of it
SHOOT THE STUFF
The GAS TANK
OMG i almost blew my mind
LAWL Phase4 XD
Commander_Shepard Lol yeah but I have no idea of anybody who actually bought it
leave them Phase4 that would be halarious
its meant to be an ok game from what ive heard
Kandarihu|BuddyBear: Also, if I made a character for an MMORPG, I would agree with you. Not in Equestria, though.
I HEAR TANK
LOL
TeamWORK!
It is done Vordox muhahahaha
MMORPGs would be an exception in my book
Run Phase!
it would appear that my internet hates me
how so?
please, do tell
14!chatstats
Loading stats program...
14o.o they still work
They're about...what...30% in XD
Kandarihu|BuddyBear: Depends on the race. I recently started playing World of Warcraft again, for example. If I made a Human character, I would choose a sensible name. Else, I go oatmeal and read about how names are for the given race.
14I slept too much today. It's 14:35 and I woke ip ~40 mins ago
Heck, we don't even know that he was like this all his life. Maybe he was absurdly scrawny and prone to bullying, so his parents settled on a name that establishes that he's different and beautiful and that's that.
14*up
TAAAAAAAAAAAAANK
I know, it's amazing
I haven't broken it yet
KNAT!
:O
Kandarihu|BuddyBear: And then he started the 'roids.

Don't play on easy then :P

Do 'roids even exist in Equestria?
Probably not.

Skylands, you are a Espeon.

10Espeons
roid spell?
A life dominated by working out like crazy turned him from a limp weakling to a mass of muscle.
10Why is Windows stupid?
14"oh sorry, we couldn't start Windows. How abotu a system repair?"
Actually, Gabe said that they are indeed working on the "conclusion to [their] Half Life series". Notice that he never said "3".
14after system repair
10lul
and then he became a wrestler
14"oh sorry, we couldn't system repair. How about a system restore?"
14after system restore
He has teeny tiny little wings, but he flies as well as the rest of them.
Lol he claims episode 2 and 3 are half-life 3
10If at first you don't succeed, try try again
2lol
lol episode 1 and 2
14"oh sorry, we can't fix this problem. How about sending informations to Microsoft?"
Windows is stupid
14I restart
14everything is fine
14BUT
14now I have to download mIRC 7.25 again
hurrrr
14and set up some scripts
14<.<
14firstworldproblems, I know
2so they updated the program
Kammerjunk I bet Gabe would call it HL4 just to mess with everyone
OH SHIT
hurr ZNC
who got the witch
Poor Phase, he's so confused. XD
Double tap? Really?
Lil_B|Drawing: And then say, "Oh what? You guys missed the launch of Half Life 3. Wow, you really need to pay more attention." :D
:D
Lil_B|Drawing: Being the enourmous troll he is, I would not be surprised.
Dat Glorious healing
14I swear this game is trolling me good and hard. I spent HOURS trying to recruit Munchlax, and when I finally did and look for other pokémons, now I recruit ALL the Munchlax -_-
i swear if i have to wait another 5 years for that game....i'll do nothing
Also why are you using the deb repo version of ZNC? o_O
Short video of Black Mesa nuking the Borealis, the end
Phase4: you need to leave your group what this whole game is about leaving and sticking only for your self
but i'll be veery very anoyed
2LOL Viri

Because Valve can't count to three i don't think there will be a HL2: Episode 3 or a HL3

Also, halp Viri
"Act IV Scene I is greatly important when looking at the play as a whole. The scene shows Othellos descent into darkness, Iagos skill in manipulation, and Cassios innocence and absence of romantic desire for Desdemona. It also explores the themes of reputation, truth and jealousy, and foreshadows Othello's final atrocious act. In our performance, we have tried to physically represent what is suggested in the text, to amplify an

hey Irish_Pony hows your day ben
Irish_Pony: How are you doing? :)
alexxm: What I can say is, I've got a few people to talk to, but they aren't on, so it's just a waiting game :|.
