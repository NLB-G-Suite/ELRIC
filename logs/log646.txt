twilight-sprinkle: lol yup
that games screams pinkie was here all over the place
maybe slightly said
2,14 all it is, is angst angst needless angst
Squall and Rinoa ftw
2,14 plus throw in a bit of: "WE'RE SAD, FEEL BAD FOR US"
2,14 I figured some people would like it
lol squall was the only relatable character
2,14 I have other games prepared if enough people ask for it
all of this makes me wanna waste 4 hours and watch all of Spoonys Videos again XD
sephiroth is awesome
spehiroth was great in ff7:cc
Ember: Okay.
altho i think he couldve been more developed
2,14 yeah, and it's all emotional drivel
oh thats why that movie made no sence..
derp.
becasue somehow that was supposed to be bad
Anyone from england here?
And I played this FF. I like it.
hello
/me hugs all the ponies
grouphug
i litterally thought it was just a movie
Hey AJIsAwsome
2,14 because I'd be a hypocrit if I hated it without giving it a try'
2,14 in fact I've played through it like 7 times
2,14 fuck knows why
oh wait, i was kinda lying over here D:
yeah, Advent Childtren WITHOUT knowing FF7="Who are these Characters, why is this happening?", watching it and having played the Game="What the F..."
Maybe it's fun to play, with it's psuedo-real-time battle system?
2,14 more like I keep trying to find some reason to like it, and get horibly disappointed every time
Ember: That really doesn't count. That really really doesn't count.
lol, y not?
2,14 until I find a reason to like 13, no
Advent Children STILL doesn't make much sense if you know FF7 already, but at least you can sort of follow what's going on. :P

WTF?
GTA?!
Vodrox ya
13>open stream
13>JRPG voice acting
how old is that girl?
Why is Vanille a bad character again?
13i can't NOPE.avi fast enough
I wasn't paying attention to her. :D
VANILLE DAMNIT you are doing it wrong!
seriously, how old is she?
2,14 for people watching maybe
2,14 still sucks for the person playing :P
ugh
Oh great, now you get to play as Hope
Archtypes ahoy at first
13Panda: JRPG voice acting is horrendous
oh ... oh no ... I fibnally lost my faith in humanity :(
And then they carsh and die and everypony cheers

Or play it... I don't know
WTF?
2,14 yes, you are

awkward silence
YOUNGSTERS SHOULD NOT DRIVE
2,14 not much growth
13the rare two horn metal movement
2,14 except Vanille is always like that
and it already got 80.000$ :( why... oh why is this the kind of thing people are throwing money at?!
she'S not on a concert
2,14 I beg to difer
2,14 at least with most revenge plots I can sympathize
sure, lets go investigate!
2,14 logic, I can haz?
I CANT STAND HER
NO
godammit, STOP MAKING NOISS
JUST NO VANILLE
well isn't that convinient
Dat Unconvinient enemy
BUMERANG GO
and a boomerang out of nowhere
XD
AHHHHHHH i hate you vanille
2,14 he's emotionally detached from all this fighting, and then pulls out a fucking boomerang out of nowhere
Ember: no vid links during stream plz
Dat unallowed link
Ember: No links
sorry D:

Ember: dont be sorry, just dont do it, or read the rules
Didn't read the rules, I see
MURDER
xD
FFVII, FFVIII, FFVI, FF9, FF5 - rest
hi
2,14 first off, no he doesn't
2,14 secondly, operation NORA is Hope's thing
Is NOONE here really thinking Rinoa is WORST FF character? .<
>_>
Ouch, someone doesnt know the story line
hug
Rinoa is the "main side hero" of FFVIII..
EVER
Atleast Vanille has brains....ish
2,14 HAH
DAT ACTING
Aw, and she thought she was going to get some.
my guess is on brain damage
Oh yeah, most people here has NO idea about the story atm. XD
LAGUNA FTW
2,14 and frankly, if you can't appreciate her role in the story, then that just makes me sad more than angry
00,10punch kick it's all in the mind
Is this a prerecorded livestream?
2,14 Rinoa*
The Snape Dumbledore one.
And I'm not saying "annoying", I said "Worst" character
<.<
Sazh for goodness sake..
Like Adamant from FFIX
press 25 times enter to instal
Anyone tlel me 3 reasons why Rinoa is a good character?(Actually BEING good, not TALKING good)
^HATE that mechanic
hi
If I wanna hear Eyes on Me, I just open iTunes
dat wall
dat post
it scared me
2,14 ...are you kidding?
inb4 counterpost
2,14 she's the entire pivotal keystone for Squall's development
wait is that possible?
2,14 well then you didn't pay much attention to it
de-emo someone?
waht was that for?
gotta throw in the FF13 Soundtrack again... I remember thinking it was Meh ... (not bad, but I didn't like it)
/me is sad

2,14 I'm aware archerjoe
its just pretty boring
bye
2,14 that doesn't at all sound interesting to me, no offense
2,14 but fanboy arguing isn't really my favorite past-time
It's not about fanboy, heck I'm not a FF fanboy at all.
/me waves
Wasn't there Robots pony later...? <.<
ponies are overrated :P
Or was that FFXIII-2...
L'cie about that.
Vanille... you are WAY too..."Euh euh SQUEE"
ok, FF13 music is kinda unique in FF-music, way way lest orchestra and more other styles, but I generally find it to be lacking :/
Vanille kind of scares me.
Not Emo yet, Still emotional. Emo comes later after the first chapter.
hello
waaaat
<--- Dat forced Dictatorship of the Fal'cie.
Sazh, not helping dude.
Has anyone played smite?
;D

Good afternoon everypony!

Some for good, some for bad.

Smooth Hope, smooth.
YAHooo
:3
Oh mai
lol
and swimming lyra...lol
Wow. I think I came literally within seconds of my laptop's battery running out
Oh yeah, this flashback
And we pick up at the local diner. Makes sense.
Advent Children?
THERE SHE IS
2,14 oh, you were talking about Fang
Is there a reason she's dressed like a Catholic Schoolgirl?
2,14 never mind then
2,14 meh
telepipe and plugged my computer back in
<.<
<.<
Oho!
acting
2,14 I've repressed 12 out of my memory
12? What's that?
Oh yeah, Fran.
DUDE! You're flirting ABOUT her sister AND her.. XD
2,14 and threw away a perfectly good story
oh, is this the movie that the animators took like, 500 hours on one hair?
2,14 no, this is my normal color
oh
wait, that was a cutscene?
<.<
why was I surprised that was a cutscence
*cutscene
I only know of these things because of HC Bailly :P
<.<
Hirokazu Tanaka is the best ... just wanted to throw that out there
whatever you say george
well hope, thats how time works
ello everypony
hey
2,14 quick....now kill her
XD
glug glug glug glug
"I don't like sand...."
Ooooh!
I like it when Hope and Vanille flirt :D
Now I remember Reks
D:
That looks a lot like the sphere grid from FFX. O.o
You mean that wasn't?
I thought that was mindless bullshit
maybe this is why I never get dates
Pfft.
Oh yeah, I forgot about Tidus and Yuna. I was thinking more of Squall and Rinoa.
Then you have a solid cast of characters for the most part, absolutely no whiny drama, and still have a great narrative.
well, more like draining and sad
*depressing
Lol
But then you'd have no Tara Strong :(
Her very existence is the most disturbing sort of fanservice. >_>
(c wut I did thar)
>.>
-_(\
Admit it, you laughed. If only on the inside.
....are they attacking Ho-oh?
sure, why not
omg I saw a paradigm shift
Well, the combat is certainly flashy....but it's hard for me to gauge how much substance it has. :/
http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/6/67/250Ho-Oh.png/160px-250Ho-Oh.png
I was pretty fond of FFX's combat, actually.
i really need 2 get back in to the ff series
It's probably the best I've seen in the series.
It remains fast-paced, but the fact that there's generally tactics to it that make you swap characters on the fly, I like that.
It's just a shame the sphere grid rapidly becomes abusable, or it'd work quite well.
hey guys :)
Suddenly it's a chase scene.
because it is
I'm guessing 13 since I don't recognize the characters.
which one?
all of them
at once
/me doesnt know
I honestly don't know but I'm betting 13. :P
This is thirteen, yeah.
it's 13. Trust me.
Think this is the one Yahtzee said was basically "run down a linear corridor for the entire game"
yeah, it looks a lot like 13-2
wazaaaaaaaaaaah
O_O
I don't know if that speaks all that well of me, though.
Is that a bad thing?
Probably means I'm too buried in RPGs.
What's this?
Lol
is 200,000 gil a lot in this one?
05still val streaming?
Holla everypony! :)
I'll be back in a bit
I'll be back in a bit. Need to restart. :D
"Fingers of Stone"
O.o
Is that the name of the region?
Why would you call a place "Fingers of Stone"?
I am glad that Chrono trigger was not made today, cuase it would probably be like this.
Well that was fast.
that is the first 3 star I have seen.
or perhaps vanille...
okay yeah, that's vanille
*throws care package*
I think the Last Ramnant had a battle system very much like this one
Not sure though. I own it but have not played it but maybe 30 minutes
homestuck... is long ...
Holla again! Back from restart. :)

Well, if you have the cash, go for a gaming desktop.
SHE UUUUGGGGGLLLYYY
Fair enough.
I had to do the same.
/me has never had steak. :D
Not that I have a problem with drinking -- I certainly'll accept any drink offered to me as long as it doesn't taste like piss. But, y'know, why try to get drunk when you enjoy other substance uses more?
too much beer
And by "doesn't taste like piss" I really mean "isn't beer," haha
It tastes horrible.
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GargleBlaster

>_> no
I swear. SWAG.MOV is probably the only PONY.MOV that I'm genuinely looking forward to. I really don't care for this series' style of humor, but I'm really curious how it's going to end.
:)
I liked most of them, but the one I can't really stand to watch again is Party.mov.
I just can't wait for swag.mov
I HAVE FIVE CURES RUNNING AROUND MY HOUSE!!!
whats that thing at the botton right there with those 3 different colors there?
APPLE.MOV and SPIKE.MOV are fine here. The rest are questionable to flat-out censored.
ERRR... SIX!!! WHEN DID THE SIXTH ONE HAPPEN???
KILL IT WITH FI-YAAAAAH!
I dislike the .MOV series, but I won't ruin it for peho like it.ople w
and then the stream was over :<
Sorry keyboard buttons get stuck.
I liked the first two, Shed.MOV was okay, and I hated Party.MOV
yah
this song <3
Magic.MOV is okay, IMO.
though right now its just showing pretty picutures of flags
Annn there it ends
:3
this song
na na na na na na
Nyan~
Same.
They can be cruel
Murray wins his first slam, and Djokovic stays away from Federer's records. goooood :3 although Djokovic still has a very long way to go
haha

I'm just drinkin expresso like nothin's happening
Lol I made a song in famitracker because of a 2 second sound from a pony YTP :D
lol
It makes Nittany an unemployed mod.
IMO, I found nothing really humorous in PARTY.MOV, most of it was disgusting to me. However, if you like it, more power to you.
*cough
I should say too many maids makes Nittany an unemployed mod.
Things in excess are bad.
name of the song?

my gamecube console color was purple
Here's the fic I mentioned before, please comment to help me make corrections :)
^
Honestly, I associate more with the NES and SNES even though the N64 was really "my generation"
N64 = Our childhood of the 90s.
Went to the playstation and Xbox.
gah
the snes was superior.
took one look and never looked back
N64 is best console
Don't forget Donkey Kong Country 1, 2, AND 3. Shit's awesome.
I had Donkey Kong 64. Thank you very much.
I mean, over sooo many games are said to be the greatest the industry has to offer.
i have a vita
I have a DSi
nostalgic games for me - Bucky O'Hare, Primal Rage, TMNT arcade

AjIsAwesome.AFTER 4
Don't know why's DKC 3 is the least acclaimed of the bunch...It's kind of underlooked...
My future with consoles is uncertain. It's wait and see for me.
earthbound was very underrated
I am :p

Oh, and I also LOVED DKC Returns.

Why is everyone on this sight a gamer?

There may have once been a time when EQD wasn't crappy about this.
I didn't

It's just a morals thing.
lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31-YOZ_dY0g
Why is there a no spoilers policy? Because it's not considerate to everyone else.

Concept's the same.

if that's a word
I think about as close as its going to get for Rarity
Falesly?
but applies differently
Guys do research before assuming
seriously
Not really.
it'll make you look less like an idiot
Bullshit.
EQD needs no more views.
You do watch their view counter, right?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGI4w6nznw8&feature=plcp
Reading is personal. You and the story. Writing is an expression.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=FLR9HsA55ivKKU0EAQmXcQLQ&feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=Lhif1x_d_AQ
If anything, this is perhaps worse.
Reading outloud is totally acceptable, when someone is willing to listen.
no seriously and I'm talking about everything
not really since 100000000

Backgrounds and emblems.
Well, a bit down the emblem line is some manner of combined sun and crescent moon, that's rather nice.
13trackers is best music
I can hear bits of Unreal Tournament in this.

Yeah, I made a WAV of an NES sound file and it came out to about 16MB
13yup
13there are only four notes playing at a time
13you can see them :3
this intricate at only four notes?
All that looks like is gibberish.
GODDAMMIT WHY DOES MUSIC SUCK NOW?
SERIOUSLY THIS MAKES NO SENSE

*"I just met you"*
Because frankly smashing things is the only proper answer.

Although it seems to be between two defined pitches as far as I can hear it.
13they're still around i think
needs moar Cradle Theme from goldeneye n64
it ties into each of the dungeons, that much I know
These songs need to have more exposure.
I only looked after asking. I see, they are still around.
13bass getting through okay? this is more awesome than i remember it :3
Yep.
It's alright.
Going to have to take my thief into Whispers and get a look at that.

As well as Beethoven followed by Katamari
The bass is coming through wonderfully

I'm not getting any sound from stream hm-
oh wait, yes I am. Just really low
maybe you need to refresh
yeah it was just really low
I'm going crazy trying to remember this movie..
Night everyone who's here.
Night Kiwi
:>
Umm well i can't really tell dude
A Knight's Tale?
Is it just me or is the sound very very quiet and slightly off synch
I'll bet that place has a good looking kings throne chair
aww figures
This film again?
Gnight, everyone.
Is the stream quiet for anyone else?
you need to refresh buddy
very low and quiet
was*
9/11**
thats cool
Mostly, I draw portraits and other things.
But I can do other things as well
how about siramics or whatever is called
I just need to be more active, but its ok though. I need to make flyers
Heh flyers
for the locals in my city
hmp
One thing I loved about the Canterbury Tales was Chaucer's self-inserts. XD
!?
Is this a movie?
yes
Mm, the sound is a little behind the image.
:)
lol yup
What's the movie called?
"A Knight's Tale" I do believe
Her hair looks purpley
it is
Buffer is a good thing this time, it synch the sound back up.
Is it me though or is the sound a little low?
It's veeryy low
pardon my redundance
LAWL
:D
GET ON WITH IT
/me Geeeeeeeeeeeet Ooooooon with iiiiiiiit
Knight's Tale
and congestion.
Nah. We watching A Jokers Tale.
BY THE PÓWER OF GRAYSKULL
GRAYHOUND
I thought he was going to chop that dudes head off
Heh nice looking throne chairs
Hax!
Ooh, a cheater.
The other knight's got hax
Cheaters are needed in movies. It gives the hero an excuse to win from an otherwise superior opponent.
The ding scared the shit out of me
:D awesome!
Pony!
hi everyone :)
OWNED
good day all
LIKE A BOSS
hmm, this movie looks familiar. Wasnt this on a recent movie night?
Which is kind of surprising to me to be honest.
I think war of the roses is done
Lots of freezes though. Or is that just me?
oh yea, second october
I was excited until I heard it was third person-
they seem to have tried to make it very accurate that way
let me check.
War of the roses
Never heard of it.
think quake arena with knights
That's because the game's not out yet.
gah, jittering
Heck, just regular Guile's Theme would do. It goes with everything. :P
TASTE THE SPEAR MUTHAFUCKA
Call of duty, medieval England?
pretty much
it's very violent.
They're rubbing him in his face
TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO
You're not whacking a a sword against a healthbar there, you're stabbing people in the face.
yes, the only thing that dissapoitned me, is the third person
but--yeah
screw yo armour!
Shit there we go
That was awesome that was great
Good movie........
I'm going to have to go. The stream is too bad for me to follow more of this.
NAY, Great one
Oh and it ends. Nice timing.
I am out, good night everypony
End a medieval movie with AC/DC. BRILLIANT!
not yet
yes
Aah- thanks! Cause when I wanted to read a sign or look at something, I'd always have ot kinda..stand next to it and twist and turn-
Tab will- help
Ooh
Whoa, that looked a lot shorter when I copied it.
