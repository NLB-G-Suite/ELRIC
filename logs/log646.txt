Caramel: Well, it's interesting about severalt hings
twilight-sprinkle: lol yup
that games screams pinkie was here all over the place
cloud has no reason to be emo
maybe slightly said
Caramel: Like how they are trying to make the FF Grim again compared to FFVII
but not so downright emo
I love Terra and Cloud
2,14 all it is, is angst angst needless angst
Terra is best final fantasy character, but cloud is my favorite
Squall and Rinoa ftw
Caramel: Mostly, aye
2,14 plus throw in a bit of: "WE'RE SAD, FEEL BAD FOR US"
RoboGerbil: squall is just, ughhhhhhhhhhhhhh
im okay with emoish characters if they have a Really serious reason to be emo, but cloud has none
Caramel, please pardon me for asking, but why are you playing this game if you hate it so much?
Caramel: Well everyone has a sad story for a background :P
i have no idea what im saying, but i think sepiroth is bast char? he was baddass in the movie at least.
2,14 I figured some people would like it
lol squall was the only relatable character
Ember: Movie? :S
Kandarihu: So the chat can make fun of it
2,14 I have other games prepared if enough people ask for it
all of this makes me wanna waste 4 hours and watch all of Spoonys Videos again XD
sephiroth is awesome
and idc what the bandwagon haters say
Caramel: Sazh's family, Vanille's existance, Lighting's family, Snow's circumstances, etc etc
AJIsAwesome: yes, it was called advent cilderen or something like that
spehiroth was great in ff7:cc
Ember: Okay.
altho i think he couldve been more developed
Caramel it's cool, we are united as Brothers in our Desire to bitch about this game
2,14 yeah, and it's all emotional drivel
Caramel: For most part, sadly yes. So if you cannot like the characters it gets kinda...
2,14 it's poorly written, poorly designed, and an insult to what the series used to be
Ember: You should play FF7 so Advent Children makes a little more sense.
say Caramel do you have ff7: crisis core?
Caramel: Well, let's say apathetic. ><
oh thats why that movie made no sence..
derp.
the only thing i knwo about final fantasy: sephiroth > STAB!
Caramel: oy, you have any multiplayer games on the PS3?
Ember: It's literally a sequel to the game.
Ember: You need to watch every single Final Fantasy to understand, Final Fantasy Spirit's Within!
becasue somehow that was supposed to be bad
Evening. I had to beat this chat to get in.
Anyone from england here?
Vordox: Spirits Within is NOT a Final Fantasy as far as I'm concerned
i didnt know of any final fantasy game untill this stream started
And I played this FF. I like it.
hello
Gold_Demona: Ikr? Watcing Avent CHildren without playing FF7 first-- or at least watsching the Retrospective-- is like watching one big, beautiful, well crafted batch of What the FU--
/me hugs all the ponies
Gold_Demona: Heh I know, but it got dropped into a stigma JUST because of the name, which is sad.
grouphug
i litterally thought it was just a movie
So what was the most recent FF game made?
Caramel: Wait, you completed the game? O.o
Gives the special hug of friendshp to applejack2012
Vordox: Yeah, it's a good movie if you ignore the "Final Fantasy" in the title.
2,14 eeyup
Which is your favourite FF13 Character? mine is Hope.
Hey AJIsAwsome
2,14 because I'd be a hypocrit if I hated it without giving it a try'
Caramel: OH! Then you must've loved the randomness of the Scrapheap part :D
Vordox: I hated it for a long time because of that.
MrMalk: Hi! :)
Caramel: <3 Good ideal
2,14 in fact I've played through it like 7 times
2,14 fuck knows why
Caramel: It's a good game? :P
Is barbetos here AJ?
oh wait, i was kinda lying over here D:
Caramel: Boredom I take it
Which on Caramel? This one?
2,14 if something that makes you want to stab yourself is a good game, then yes
yeah, Advent Childtren WITHOUT knowing FF7="Who are these Characters, why is this happening?", watching it and having played the Game="What the F..."
Maybe it's fun to play, with it's psuedo-real-time battle system?
i have a ff game, but its crystal chronicles
MrMalk: Yep. I spoke to him a while ago. 30 min., I think.
Caramel: Then... That dedication of 100%?
Lil_B: LOL yeah! XD
Lil_B: Inb4 "RUFUS" bomb
2,14 more like I keep trying to find some reason to like it, and get horibly disappointed every time
Ember: That really doesn't count. That really really doesn't count.
AJIsAwesome when cypresswolf get on you guys are going to tell me the story
Caramel: I assume you haven't played FFXIII-2?
lol, y not?
"Where's the soul?" I could ask you the same thing, game. :S
"Where's the soul?" The though of all the fans who played this game
2,14 until I find a reason to like 13, no
AJIsAwesome: When does games have SOul?
Advent Children STILL doesn't make much sense if you know FF7 already, but at least you can sort of follow what's going on. :P
Caramel: Keep digging... :P
Obsidian: :D
Vordox GTA has soul
---
WTF?
GTA?!
I actually played FF7 only to the point where you get out of the City... after that I got bored :/
Ember: Crystal Chronicles is a spin-off game. Spin offs never count.
it'S true
Gold_Demona: Advent CHildren made perfect sense to me. Then again, I'm sort of an odd duck.
Vodrox ya
MrMalk: I hope you mean 4th one
Kencolt: It made sense when I first watched it, but then I thought back on it and I was like "WTF?"
Kencolt: I know the FF7 story through the internet only, Still made sense for me.
Vordox ya the best one
question
13>open stream
Kencolt: Also, the intros to all the familiar characters was pretty poorly executed. :P
13>JRPG voice acting
how old is that girl?
MrMalk: <3 (\
Why is Vanille a bad character again?
13i can't NOPE.avi fast enough
Lawl Shizuka :D
Ohi Shizuka
I wasn't paying attention to her. :D
Vordox I beleive they have a MLP GTA MOD
AJIsAwesome: because she is a stepford Smiler?
MrMalk: Don't have any interest in it =3
2,14 to be fair, this game sucks, and we're playing it to laugh at it
VANILLE DAMNIT you are doing it wrong!
seriously, how old is she?
Shizuka: fun thing is, it'S not as horrible as it culd be. except for these two kids
Caramel: So that's the GOOD thing about this? :P
Vordox you dont want all the people to turn into ponies?
2,14 for people watching maybe
MrMalk: Nah, I prefer 2D before 3D
Caramel: Oh....
2,14 still sucks for the person playing :P
Shizuka join us, for we are united in our effort to complain about this game!
Caramel: Do an autoplay then!
so Caramel do you have ff7: crisis core for psp?
ugh
why is hope so fucking lame
How come the "kid" bas a bigger rack than the main Heroine?
So those two are siblings?
/me is away: DINNER nomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnom
Caramel: I like the game, but then, I haven't played any other FF yet. It must be better than FF14 at least.
Will there be another steam sale soon?
Kencolt: Japan
Kencolt it's japan
Oh great, now you get to play as Hope
Kencolt: Japan. Just Japan. :S
Kencolt: Because fanservice. :P
um... Shizuka you dont like Japanese voice acting? O-o
JUST A BIG WARNING FOR EVERYONE
Archtypes ahoy at first
Dark_Horst you sure? will it be as big as summer sale?
13Panda: JRPG voice acting is horrendous
I was so sure, Hope would end up with Vanille during these first parts.
MrMalk: pretty much
oh ... oh no ... I fibnally lost my faith in humanity :(
Shizuka: Ever seen Skies of Arcadia?
If only you could make hope jump off that bridge
Dark_Horst Thank
Shizuka: You must admit, this one is at least trying.
So those two are siblings?
I haven't played a JRPG, so... sorry Shizuka >.<
AJIsAwesome: no
god, i havent heard one complete paragraph from her and i already wanna shoot her
Obsidian: Okay.
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
Shizuka: For most part, like Tales of series, the Voice acting is ...URGH, also somewhat linked to FFX. >.>
suprise buttsex
2,14 Dark_Horst: welcome to the life of playing 13
alexxm NOOOOOO
sooo Free plants vz zombies who wants it ?
A Kickstarter for Camera, where you can stack your iPhone in the front, so you can make real analoge Photos of your digital photos in an instand... this is real guey
Caramel: i want ooooout!
And then they carsh and die and everypony cheers
Lyra is TRYING to save the game
guys*
Or play it... I don't know
Skies of Arcadia nostalgia
WTF?
Am I the only guy who thinks Hope has awesome Character Development.
2,14 yes, you are
*?
awkward silence
Caramel: He does grew, but it's a painful grow :P
YOUNGSTERS SHOULD NOT DRIVE
am i the only one who just found out ff is a game and didnt know even if i have a spin off game of it?
2,14 he goes from being a whiny bitch to a useless kid who can't shut his mouth
he totally sniffed her ass there
2,14 not much growth
Caramel: So like Vanille!
Until now, the only gripe I heard about this game is that it's really linear. I think I see that here.
13the rare two horn metal movement
2,14 except Vanille is always like that
Hey, at least he behaves better than some other chars that do the Revenge Plot and don't catch themselves like Hope did.
Caramel: So it's 2 Vanille... heh :P
what the hell does the expect from holding her hands that way
and it already got 80.000$ :( why... oh why is this the kind of thing people are throwing money at?!
she'S not on a concert
2,14 I beg to difer
a dangerous place full of guys who want to kill you
2,14 at least with most revenge plots I can sympathize
sure, lets go investigate!
2,14 he wants to kill a guy because his mother volunteered
2,14 logic, I can haz?
I CANT STAND HER
Caramel: Kids
NO
godammit, STOP MAKING NOISS
JUST NO VANILLE
well isn't that convinient
Caramel: terrible writing
Dat Unconvinient enemy
BUMERANG GO
Vordox: yes, but he at least knows when to call it quits. And Caramel. The kid is 12/13. Cut him some slack. And how many Characters beat the shit out of enemies with a Boomerang?
and a boomerang out of nowhere
Caramel: what, that blonde boy there?
XD
well, at least teh space elevator got funded XD
2,14 that's supposed to make him better?
I want revenge on a guy at a dallas mcdonalds for making me wait 45 minutes extra just to get a drink
AHHHHHHH i hate you vanille
Caramel: And really, if there is ONE character I hate in FF... It's Rinoa.
13i miss ff7..
Sokka is best boomerang wielder.
2,14 he's emotionally detached from all this fighting, and then pulls out a fucking boomerang out of nowhere
Shizuka: THANK YOU
Shizuka: we all do
Shizuka: So mainstream.. :P
Vordox: So hipster. :P
Caramel: He's a kid who just lost his mom, and from his position it looked like Snow dropped her.
Shizuka: it is one of the best final fantasies, being 6 and 7 that is
Gold_Demona: Hah ah!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7wJ8pE2qKU here, have some nostalgia
Ember: no vid links during stream plz
Dat unallowed link
Ember: No links
sorry D:
didnt know
Ember: dont be sorry, just dont do it, or read the rules
Shizuka, play it again D:
Didn't read the rules, I see
Ember: that'S why your ead the rules
2,14 from his position, he should have recognized the fact they were going to stop people from killing him. And rather than bitching at the guy who risked himself to protect them, he tries to murder him because he lost his mommy
MURDER
Caramel, typical story line? O-o
I've always had a warm spot for FF9. Had a really interesting leveling system, and you could make your pary eventually freakishly unstoppable.
Panda: Ish :P
xD
Caramel: terrilbe character
Vordox: actually its a lot more mainstream to say that ff7 is mainstream
FFVII, FFVIII, FFVI, FF9, FF5 - rest
afternoon, everypony :) what are we watching?
Who runs like that in real life? :D
Caramel: He gets better at least. And Snow always pokes (unknowingly) in the wound with operation NORA.
Sylandest: Hi! :)
hi
AJIsAwesome: down syndrome
2,14 first off, no he doesn't
hello Sylandest... welcome.
Heya Sylandest
2,14 secondly, operation NORA is Hope's thing
Is NOONE here really thinking Rinoa is WORST FF character? .<
/me hugs Panda and Sylandest
>_>
Caramel: sorry, been some time since I played.
Hiyo Sylandest. We are watching Caramel play Final Fantasy XIII
Ouch, someone doesnt know the story line
howdy AJIsAwesome, Panda, MLP_Brovakiin
Vordox: that is reserved for vanille
hug
/me hugs Lil_B back
/me glomps Lil_B
Vordox: i have no idea who is who anyway
Rinoa is the "main side hero" of FFVIII..
I hate her big time, she's NEVER good.
EVER
Atleast Vanille has brains....ish
2,14 HAH
Good question
2,14 oh god, I needed that laugh
DAT ACTING
Aw, and she thought she was going to get some.
what is with this girl
my guess is on brain damage
alexxm: Spoilers. She IS the narrator after all.
Caramel: Seriously! LOOK at Rinoa's story... Where is she ever GOOD?!
Oh yeah, most people here has NO idea about the story atm. XD
2,14 don't use general terms like "good"
LAGUNA FTW
so far
2,14 and frankly, if you can't appreciate her role in the story, then that just makes me sad more than angry
what i have seen of him
Vordox: Remember her ruining the Assassination by walking up to the sorceress.
Bronysith: FFVIII has been out for over 10 years. That's no spoiling anymore.
00,10punch kick it's all in the mind
punch those robot dogs
Caramel: I can undersand her story, but character wise... No. She fecks up everything over and over again, gets kidnapped more then one time, FECKS up her own plans all the time...
Is this a prerecorded livestream?
Caramel: and of course the whole Vessel plot... >.>
MrMalk: No, its live
And character development...Well... True, she did evolve somewhat.
Sumica O_o I love you.
Sumica: That rappah
Bronysith: That's not special. IF all existance would end. THAT would be a shock.
00,10Mit says mips in the top right and you are asking if it's livestream?
Sumica: I think you'll like MysteryBen27's upcoming video then. :D
2,14 sorry Vordox, but I basically can't buy anything you sell when you legitimately said Vanille is less annoying than Rinoar
2,14 Rinoa*
Caramel: That "less" isn't much.. =P
Bronysith at least everyoner is alive at the end of mother 3 :) exepct the people who died before the end
Bronysith: The last one, it's my favourite Spoiler Joke.
The Snape Dumbledore one.
And I'm not saying "annoying", I said "Worst" character
what I ust wrote sounded really stupid... I apologyse and try again -.-
<.<
Sazh for goodness sake..
LIGHTNING IS PRINCESS AT SHOWING NO EMOTION
and the door said, i forgive you
Bronysith: Reminds me of atleast 8 other characters in FF
Bronysith: I LOVE Light. She's awesome.
Like Adamant from FFIX
Cloud from 7
00,10reminds me of music and sound effects from armored core 2
Cloud showed alot of emotions... As Cloud, but not as Zack while being Cl....errgh
Calmness, Bronysith. We get it. Your seething hatred for this game is plain as day.
Bronysith: sorry, Cloud from Advent Children. In looks and emo-ness?
Vordox: wait..wha..hu..WHAT?
I would give the top point actually to Adamant when I think about it, his emotions are the true essence of Steel XD
Gold_Demona: THIS IS A GAME?!
Bronysith: ALTERNATE CONTINUITY!!!
00,10by the time the music gets good the fight is over
Sumica: Caramel is just that good.
Bronysith: Batman has shown emotion too. Most just remember his brooding.
2,14 yeah, see how good I am at pressing X?
YEAH, that skillz man, Caramel is the best FFXIII playah
your pressing X like a baws caramel
Press X to win
THIS GAME SUCKS
its like installing windows 7
Caramel A winner is you
press 25 times enter to instal
Bronysith! Dude! Seriously with the caps, man!
So...
Snow, only if you like all the defaults
Anyone tlel me 3 reasons why Rinoa is a good character?(Actually BEING good, not TALKING good)
2,14 Vordox: does that sentence even make sense to you?
00,10press r1 dueeing attack to do more damage >_>
^HATE that mechanic
Vordox: She makes the game play Eyes on Me?
hi
Hiyo CCCP
Hello CCCP
hey CCCP
oh god, is it THAT kind of character?
If I wanna hear Eyes on Me, I just open iTunes
hello CCCP
hia CCCP ;)
CCCP: Hi! :)
Vordox: Reason 2: She uses the DOGLAUNCHER!!!
Caramel: I'm just very certain about my choice of worst character. When I played the games, I always avoid Rinoa cause she's never used for anything good as a story character OR character development? The whole Assassination plan mishaps, possessing, Vessel for Witch, Family rebellion. The ONLY good thing she did AS said, was the whole Train act. >.>
HI CCCP my name is malk whats youres
dat wall
dat post
it scared me
2,14 ...are you kidding?
btw... whats the name of that Planet they are on again?
MrMalk wat
/me nomz MrMalk
Caramel: No, unless there is something I really missed.
inb4 counterpost
2,14 she's the entire pivotal keystone for Squall's development
2,14 like seriously, did you even PLAY the game?
/me nomz on CCCP
Caramel: Several times. actually. Mostly 100% it
Vordox: Reason 3: She DE-Emo's Squall/Leon/Whatever.
/me says CCCP you need some pepper
wait is that possible?
So...
2,14 well then you didn't pay much attention to it
MrMalk :I
de-emo someone?
/me murders Snow
I did, Caramel, there's a reason I put FFVIII as second favourite FF.
/me gives CCCP some pepper :3
waht was that for?
Snow: You replace the Emo-ness with Love.
gotta throw in the FF13 Soundtrack again... I remember thinking it was Meh ... (not bad, but I didn't like it)
00,10not what was the worst part about ff8, accidentally spreading crapy rules in triple triad
CCCP mabye we could stew you or something in some fresh chicken broth steak blood mix
ff4 is the only game I played with from that franchise and I didnt even finish it. It just doesn't appeal to me.
/me is sad
/me hugz Snow
whats the matter Snow
Vordox: That's why I like Hope after he gets over the revenge part.
bronysith murderd me
/me also hugs Snow :3
/me gives cccp his special hug of friendship
dat FFXIII :D
good evening everyone
/me gives Phoenix Down to Snow
Hello Alchemist
/me revives
Sumica: At least Triple Triad made some sense, even with bad rules. The game after that in FF9-- I forget what it was called, but that was just a big bowl of "How does this even WORK?"
Alchemist: Hi! :)
Good evening sir your a gentleman and a scholar Phoenix
Dat delusion, Snow...
Snow: nothing personal, you are just from a terrible game, thats all
dat echo
how are things Alchemist
...
what game then?
hi there Alchemist :)
Snow: final fantasy 13
alexxm: its been better alexxm, thanks for asking. But then again its been worse too.
2,14 "what should I do?" Grow up and get the fuck over it
Caramel: Truth
Bronysith Seems Legit
Well, I'm gonna get going for the day. See y'all tomorrow Bronystate.
Caramel: Agreed
bye Gold_Demona
Worst motivational Speaker = goes to.... VANILLE!
Bye Gold_Demona

Gold_Demona: Bye! :)
i just watched the human centipede =/
Caramel: That takes some more Chapters.
bye Gold_Demona
CCCP: Why?
CCCP: Why? :S
Dat 5 star pro play, Caramel
im actually my own OC so dont compare me with anyone bronysith!
CCCP I was peer pressured into saying Why?
Obsidian and AJIsAwesome and MrMalk its not that gross really
Caramel: After stream, I would like to have an arguement with you about Rinoa, if you want to that is.
its just pretty boring
bye
im gonna watch part 2 today
bye Applejack2012
2,14 that doesn't at all sound interesting to me, no offense
laters Applejack2012
Bye Applejack2012

2,14 but fanboy arguing isn't really my favorite past-time
Caramel: none taken, opinions, that's all.
Applejack2012: Bye! :)
It's not about fanboy, heck I'm not a FF fanboy at all.
well, i better get going to, later!
I just love to analyze stuff.

Snow: Bye! :)
Goodbye Applejack2012

Goodnbye Snow

Bye Snow
Bye snow
00,10this game needs more ponies
Wasn't there Robots pony later...? <.<
ponies are overrated :P
Sumica: No, they would be Mecha Zombie Ponies at best.
Or was that FFXIII-2...
Sumica: There's a summon that turns into a horse later
L'cie about that.
Vordox do you know something about FF13-Versus?
Lil_B: You mena FFXIII-3?
Considering what happens later in the game and what we find out, it makes sense that Vanille knows that much about L'Cie.
What I'm trying to figure out is why, in a sterile SF high tech city, Vanille's weapon is apparently a pair of antlers tied to a tree branch.
why are these battles so short
Vordox they renamed it? As far as I know they worked on 13-2 and 13-Versus at the same time
Vanille... you are WAY too..."Euh euh SQUEE"
Kencolt: Antique Weaponry.
Kencolt: Explained later
some one tell me the goriest movie so i can watch it :P
Obsidian: Dat EVA logic
Cue emo mode
CCCP: Saw is more of a gore film then horroe, them films are messed up :P
Vordox ive already seen it though =/
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #561
ok, FF13 music is kinda unique in FF-music, way way lest orchestra and more other styles, but I generally find it to be lacking :/
Vanille kind of scares me.
Not Emo yet, Still emotional. Emo comes later after the first chapter.
Polydunami: She's like this for a certain reason. :P
CCCP: But it is a relitivly good choise for gore films
MLP_Brovakiin =/ i heard they wernt that good but okies :3
I know that much, Vordox
That's what scares me.
CCCP: Yeah, she has a reason for why's she so..."Cherpy"
hello
waaaat
hi applejack`
<--- Dat forced Dictatorship of the Fal'cie.
Hello applejack`
Sazh, not helping dude.
applejack`: Hi! :)
Has anyone played smite?
;D
wow this guy does not know how to comfort people
HATE STORY EMO HATE
http://blogs.gartner.com/jenny-sussin/files/2011/12/50436494.jpg Seriously, this is what I think of when I see Vanille.
the worst game ever might be a game called "Escape from Atlantis"
You're going to regret saying that, Lightning =P
on the NES
Vordox I only aked about Versus.13 because I know Yoko Shimomura is making the music for it and one siong was on her "drammatica" CD... which released in 2008
Sazh is awesome. He's like the most awesome [Spoiler] Character ever.
Lil_B: I really don't know much about the th...versus what ever number it is, atm.
CCCP: No, that title goes to E.T. for the Atari 2600
ok :(
Sazh is my favourite character in this game
Obsidian: DR Jekyll and MR Hyde... But eveyr other Atari games with crap coding wins that XD
Obsidian i own that game its bad but no where as bad as Escape From Atlantis trust me
Good afternoon everypony!
hi tSparx
i got my ataria 2600 on Ebay and half the games are broken ;~;
Hello there, tSparx!
atari*
hia tSparx :)
CCCP: Get Vectrex instead :P
tSparx: Hi! :)
Heya tSparx
Vordox whats that?
Vordox dem Vectors XD
CCCP: Just write in Vectrex on googl enad you'll see. :D I love those old games
I need to head out for the moment. bbl everypony.
the virtual boy is also EXTREAMLY underrated
/me glomps CCCP, Polydunami, AJIsAwesome , and MLP_Brovakiin (unless you don't want glompage, in which case I didn't ;)
bue Obsidian
Still got your brain, Caramel ?
Vordox okies :3
00,10I still have a Vetrex
/me accepts glomp
2,14 ....what>
Sumica: <3
tSparx: I'm totaly cool with that :3
ciao Obsidian
Caramel: Button mashing and story atm.
Damn English and its lack of 2nd person singular/plural distinctions :P
2,14 I'm using my big toe to play
2,14 while I do other things
Caramel: Hah! Dem Skills
tSparx, you/all of you
"What is this Ezmode you speak of"?
Kandarihu: But you can mean 2nd person singular or plural.
CCCP: Get into Human Psychology, ish awesomez
Kandarihu There's no clear distinction, other than context, to let people know you're only talking to one person. Damn English: P
Vordox that sounds kinda interesting :)
tSparx, yeah, I guess so
CCCP: It is, once you get a good basic grip on humans understanding and brain functions, you'll start to play with Triggers.
Some for good, some for bad.
CCCP: tHE ONLY THING I LIKE IN SCHOOL IS MY ENGINEERING DIPLOMA :/
And some for dictatorships(I'm looking at you, History)
Kandarihu: I mean, *I'm* than comfortable using thou (and its associated -st conjugations), but no one else wants to bother with it, haha.
Lil_B: Wait, where di you find the soundtrack?
Oh shite dat caps lock :$
Vordox i can manipulate people? :o >:3
AJIsAwesome the info or the download?
back soon
CCCP: Don't abuse it.
Some people never understand why they do things.
You'll get the thought police on your tail, CCCP :O
MLP_Brovakiin the only thing im annoyed by in that statement is the first letter :P
^ what Polydunami said

And now a HUGE Mindfeck
bye
(For new viewers atleast)
Is that how Crystal Ponies are made?
cya CCCP
Oh my god, WarioLand: Shake it?! I loved this game, epsectially the art direction...
I don't know about you guys, but I'd want to make a cool pose before I turn to crystal :3
Yay, I'm eternally alive...
Polydunami: Does the Johnny Bravo Dance
paunch
THANK YOU LIGHTNING
Actually, a silly pose would be funnier.
SERIOUSLY, if Nintendo have to time to make a brand new Mario cartoon, THIS would of been the art style.
Well..
*the
brb guys, got some dishes to defeat
She got crystals... which are jewelry.. So should be happy eternal life?
That's why I like her. She punches Snow, who is the character who is MOST capable of annoying me.
You mean the Government is...EVIL??!!
*dun dun duuuuun*
/me is a PoliSci major >_>
MAN UP HOPE
WELLP. Time for us to become like them.
See here: Realistic Reaction to almost death by a 14 year old.

And now inb4 another Mind feck(This one actually confuzzled me big time)
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/005/616/qb.jpg I'd like to make a contract with you.
/me shoots Kyuubei in the face. "How about no"
Caramel: Getting Toe ache yet? :P
Things remind me of other things :P
Hi bronystate.
Damn those graphics are wonderful
hey FillyFlam
howdy FillyFlam
Hey there, FillyFlam
DAT ACTING
Hello FillyFlam
FillyFlam: Hi!
Not helping Lightning =P
meh Vodox
Vordox
MASF123|: Mmmmmyes?
Final boss already?
AJIsAwesome: Hur hur hur
[Spoiler] How did Queen say? "Who wants to live Foreve?"
Vordox: :P
boss tiem ? boss time.
I know Vanille...
=<
Smooth Hope, smooth.
Vordox those graphics are meh
WHO WANTS TO SEE a funny yet extremely suggestive pic?
little chocobo is the best charcater in this game
2,14 bronysith: no
What else is new, Bronysith?
Sazh: "My Chocobo gives me Super Aiming abillity."
MASF123|: I say they are pretty much one of the big reasons this was decent game... =P
Caramel: no problem
Sazh is all about style while shooting.
Vordox: and no accuracy
Bronysith: He's gangsta Ballet style :P So of course not
Vordox: But he still hits.
It'd be impossible not to hit with this fatass :D
And with a full meter his pistols fuse into a rifle.
:3
2,14 funny how every black character in FF uses guns
Caramel: oh fuck ur right
Caramel: Barret....err...
How many black characters have there been?
Caramel: Kiros?
Fal'Cie: You killed me. So I give you these Super Powers and a Vision to save the World. Have fun.
Big MINDFECK time
Caramel: Well, Barret IS a gun-- when he's not a totally insane melee weapon.
Oh yeah, I'm going to be away the entire weekend; I'm missing Brony Movie Night.
Vordox: I spoil Ten Minutes into the future.
BAD STUFF HAPPENS
Oh yeah it's a spoiler, did I mention that? =P
Vordox: NO, REALLY? I would have never guessed.
Oh mai
Who was watching Day after Tommorow?
lol
and swimming lyra...lol
Dat Narrator Vanille man...
Ugh, that movie really gets on my nerves.
Wow. I think I came literally within seconds of my laptop's battery running out
Oh yeah, this flashback
I never finished the game. I stopped at GP. Then I needed to give the game back.
And we pick up at the local diner. Makes sense.
Kandarihu: Context?
Vordox: More specific please. There are many of these.
Advent Children?
THERE SHE IS
One of the better characters =P
2,14 better because you never have to play as her...and she's barely in the game
Caramel: Says a bit, eh
2,14 oh, you were talking about Fang
Is there a reason she's dressed like a Catholic Schoolgirl?
2,14 never mind then
Oh, Lebreau. Why are you so beautiful?
Caramel: Ayup, Fang
2,14 meh
2,14 she's bland...but that's pretty much the best this game has to offer
Caramel: So.. Caramel. whose your favourite "Side" hero of FF? :)
Caramel: Dat negativity, but yeah I understand. ><
I had to move my computer over to another room for a few hours. I had it plugged in for this. After that, I brought it back to the normal spot and forgot to plug it in. Then I brought up PSO2, because I'd been gone too long. I was fighting a boss when Windows was warning me that the battery was down to 11%. So I dropped a Telepipe, hoping to run off next chance I got. Then it gave me an even more dire warning, so I used that
telepipe and plugged my computer back in
2,14 depends on your definition of "side" hero
Caramel: Playable, but not a hero(Like Snow f ex)
<.<
Incoming Sonic 06 vibes. :D
<.<
2,14 Red XIII
OH MAI; so Azn
Oho!
Caramel: Ooooh, interesting!
acting
alexxm: "acting" or acting
Caramel: Thought you would go Balthier, really.
Caramel: but yeah, Nakai was a pretty good side hero.
2,14 I've repressed 12 out of my memory
12? What's that?
Caramel: Even with characters like Balthier and Fran? D:
Oh yeah, Fran.
What? I heard nothing but good things about 12
2,14 they ruined one of the most incredible beginnings/early game
DUDE! You're flirting ABOUT her sister AND her.. XD
2,14 and threw away a perfectly good story
Caramel: Oh? The war part?
This seems so cheesy, IMO.
2,14 it IS cheesy
oh, is this the movie that the animators took like, 500 hours on one hair?
IT is the new Eyes on Me!
Well, they've had practice with eight, AJIsAwesome :3
Caramel...
2,14 it's cheesier than Tidus going to the carnival place in FF7 while wrapped in a suit of cheese
your font it's different.
2,14 no, this is my normal color
Caramel: Trying to remember the FF12 intro, it's the part with the prince?
oh
Caramel: WHhile wat5ching the pirates put on a play about romantic cheese.
whilst eating cheese
You play as Reks; Vaan's brother, Vordox.
wait, that was a cutscene?
<.<
Polydunami: Hmm, should go watch for remembering, all I see is the damn war part with the prince causing a huge start. ><
why was I surprised that was a cutscence
*cutscene
I only know of these things because of HC Bailly :P
So, they still make turn based role playing games?
<.<
Hirokazu Tanaka is the best ... just wanted to throw that out there
whatever you say george
well hope, thats how time works
ello everypony
hey
Hey there, LunarRepublicGuard
hia LunarRepublicGuard
LunarRepublicGuard: Hi! :)
why do I feel that this is one big metaphor for something
2,14 quick....now kill her
Oh god.
Caramel: thats better
XD
glug glug glug glug
CK|GW2: maybe he did
in another life
"I don't like sand...."
Ooooh!
I like it when Hope and Vanille flirt :D
Now I remember Reks
D:
Polydunami: that was flirting?
CK|GW2 Spoony reference?
That looks a lot like the sphere grid from FFX. O.o
cowvarkian: Never seen FFX Tidus and Yuna flirt? =P
You mean that wasn't?
I thought that was mindless bullshit
Lil_B: Technically Star Wars Ep 2 reference, but yes.
maybe this is why I never get dates
Pfft.
Vordox: OH GOD THE MENTAL IMAGE GET IT OUT
cowvarkian: Relationships are mindless? XD
CK|GW2 can't wait for him to start the FF13 Review
CK|GW2: XD Sorry
Vordox: are they not?
cowvarkian: ... No comment
Vordox: so, yes
Vordox: that was tidus n yuna?
Tidus and Yuna flirting was so awkward that I wanted to hang myself from the nearest bridge every time they stopped the plot railroad for more of that. >_>
CK|GW2 excuse me while I laugh like Tidus
I maintain that FFX would have been a great game if it had about half of the roster.
Oh yeah, I forgot about Tidus and Yuna. I was thinking more of Squall and Rinoa.
Polydunami: Emotionless and Annoying?
/me has never played a final fantasy game
Vordox: relationships with anyone?
Had they removed Tidus, Rikku, and Wakka....
CK|GW2: Rikku!?
Then you have a solid cast of characters for the most part, absolutely no whiny drama, and still have a great narrative.
well, more like draining and sad
*depressing
Yes, Rikku. Ms. Jailbait herself.
Lol
But then you'd have no Tara Strong :(
Her very existence is the most disturbing sort of fanservice. >_>
Yes, and I've forgiven Tara for that sin.
(c wut I did thar)
>.>
-_(\
Admit it, you laughed. If only on the inside.
*listening to Loco Rococ Sountrack* ... suddenly French Gilr Voice instead of Fake Language kids ...
Lil_B: seems legit
....are they attacking Ho-oh?
sure, why not
since I have no idea what that is
/me has had this conversation before btw
omg I saw a paradigm shift
Geeze, those sounds Vanille makes. They creep me out.
CK|GW2: none?
http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/6/67/250Ho-Oh.png/160px-250Ho-Oh.png
Polydunami: oh, then yes
Polydunami: I thought it sounded familiar
I was pretty fond of FFX's combat, actually.
i really need 2 get back in to the ff series
It's probably the best I've seen in the series.
even though it's a pokemon
CK|GW2: I loved the Sphere Dress system in FFX-2, was fun to level
It remains fast-paced, but the fact that there's generally tactics to it that make you swap characters on the fly, I like that.
It's just a shame the sphere grid rapidly becomes abusable, or it'd work quite well.
Dat big jelly
hey guys :)
ohai
hi BronyInstrumental :)
So are we in an open area for once?
Hello BronyInstrumental :)
BronyInstrumental: Hi! :)
Suddenly it's a chase scene.
this looks like final fantasy
because it is
I'm guessing 13 since I don't recognize the characters.
which one?
all of them
at once
/me doesnt know
I honestly don't know but I'm betting 13. :P
This is thirteen, yeah.
it's 13. Trust me.
Think this is the one Yahtzee said was basically "run down a linear corridor for the entire game"
yeah, it looks a lot like 13-2
wazaaaaaaaaaaah
O_O
Ah, good to know I can still spot FF at a glance.
I don't know if that speaks all that well of me, though.
Is that a bad thing?
Probably means I'm too buried in RPGs.
What's this?
2,14 where in the damn hell is that monstert
This that Final Fantasy 13 game?
Lol
is 200,000 gil a lot in this one?
At this point in the game?
05still val streaming?
So I'm guessing it is a Final Fantasy game?
05im back btw ^_^
Wrek yes
Holla everypony! :)
Hello, GilDash
GilDash: Hi! :)
Hello GilDash :)
hi Gildash!
I'll be back in a bit
/me hugs GilDash
/me hugs Lil_B.
hallaw GilDash :)
ello GilDash
I'll be back in a bit. Need to restart. :D
oh hey Wrek
so sazh, lightning, them i recognise
"Fingers of Stone"
O.o
Is that the name of the region?
he is in process of making the plushie Wrek , then i pay him, etc, he send to you, you do odin knows what with her (hug the living crap out of her)
Why would you call a place "Fingers of Stone"?
I am glad that Chrono trigger was not made today, cuase it would probably be like this.
Barbetos|AtWork: yup
Well that was fast.
what's the name of that mage? is it fang?
that is the first 3 star I have seen.
or perhaps vanille...
I wonder how it rates the battles
Probably by how happy Lyra is.
okay yeah, that's vanille
*throws care package*
I think the Last Ramnant had a battle system very much like this one
Not sure though. I own it but have not played it but maybe 30 minutes
homestuck... is long ...
Holla again! Back from restart. :)
GilDash: Welcome back! :)
/me nuzzles GilDash
Welcome back GilDash :)

xD
what is this game anyway?
Hello SuperBrony63 :D
hia SuperBrony63 :) finally finalised the DP Design, now I "only" have to make the animation
05Caramel: i dont have any obligations left so if you need a break im ready to take ovah xD
/me murders Caramel
Caramel: You can switch if you want to, we probably wouldn't mind.
Caramel: that should help, death is a better alternative to this "game"
05Caramel: deus ex on realistic, baton kills ONLY
05with all bonus missions
and suddenly silence
Wrek Gotta OCD~
05ocd?
Gotta Baton them all
05I'll give you a big grey ribbon if you brush your teeth and slap me in the behind. right near the snakebite.

Anyone else ready for Armored Kill tomorrow?!?
what?
new BF3 expansion
Oh.
I bought that
Back.
I forgot all about it.
dont really care for BF3, probably going to trade it in for something else
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Rhythm is Magic - Remix Apple Apple Apple
I guess I will play it.
BF3 is overrated imo
I really like bf3 hahaha
WELLP. Here we go again with the rhythm is magic.
Its alright, but BF2 it ain't, which is the game I liked the most.
I unfotunatly missed BF2, and most of bad company 2
Caramel: do you have any multiplayer games on PS3?
05but yeah val
05Caramel
05the queues are updated
05and you got about an hour'
You know, Bronysith, that YOLO can be used as a warning.
As in, don't drink and drive. YOLO.
then again, YOLO, why not?
^
how long does this movie last for?
is this a limit move
2,14 didn't you JUST stream Wrek?
That's the thing: if you only live once, you might want to make sure you don't die. Because you don't get to have fun if you're dead.
dead isnt fun
Polydunami: but if you only live once, then you would want to go all out
soulrider95: Not with that attitude!
MLP_Brovakiin: That may be, just not for me :3
Caramel: so do you have any multiplayer games on PS3?
That argument only works if you know you're going to die anyway, Bronysith.
As in, near the end.
Hey guys, I'm back!
Hey there, MadSurge!
Welcome back MadSurge
MadSurge: Welcome back! :)
2,14 bare with me a moment, grabbing other stuff

Lyra`: That sounds like something a MW3 player would do...
this term, klined, I am unfamiliar with it

Nobody knows
suddenly, panic!
suddenly ponies
Seapony Lyra get out of there it isn't safe!!
/me panics!
2,14 uh huh, well you still show as banned on our banlist. So I'd recommend you speak to Dari rather soon, considering he's made no indication that you aren't
am i now?
i sent in an appeal
and he talked with me abou tit
*about it
00,10he's refering to your new one from last night "S"
and said, "you can come byack"
i got banned last night?
:P
how does one get banned while being banned?
i dont remember that?
IshPoopyHead: Ban-ception
WE MUST GO DEEPER
i got kicked a few times, for overloading the chat while listing Wreks best features
MLP_Brovakiin indeed
Which DMC is this?
00,10yes Lyra` you loged in as "S" thought you would be cute and got baned for it
IshPoopyHead: 4, I think.

i was asleep at around 2100 kansas time
00,10you forgot to change your VHost when you loged in with it btw

00,10unless you are leting otheres have your account info now
a letter that stands for sexy
It's a commonly used letter, Lyra`
helpful ponies, thanks
lol what's lyra doing
but no, i was at basic training, and my account expired, so then lydian stole my name
now im just going on an unregistered one
kind of like guest with a /nick
Sumica: Could it be that Lyra` accidentally logged in (fell asleep on the keyboard maybe)?
also, if i got banned last night, wouldnt i still be banned
00,10best damn sleep typeing I have ever seen
considering im still using the same connection i have been for days?
Changelings?
05so much for that independent black woman talk. she jsut seems unable to let bronystate go
Sumica: Can I look forward to any Doctor Who anytime soon?
(on this channel)
Wrek: muffins or cupcakes?
Aw damn, I've missed the +b gauntlet
05muffins work better with coffe
05cupcakes get soo sugary with the coffee
05with tea then cupcakes
exactly
00,10perhaps if I get on early SafariMonkey
Wrek that's why coffe flavored muffins exist
hey where'd Lyra go?
Is that the last of this Lyra` fellow?
Sumica: Sorry I don't understand. Early tomorrow morning, or early afer this, or what?
00,10early morning PST
Wrek: hot coffee in the morning and tea in the afternoons? followed by celebrating your birthday extravagantly? but everyday is your birthday...

Dovah: Yep :) I already know how to ride it, use the gears & what not, but you need to be 16 to take a CBT
Bronysith: You mentioned that.
:D tSparx, wait til the grey starts setting in :)
MLP_Brovakiin: where do you live?
DashWithRainbows and i thought slurrymoon was the closest one to date of birth and all
DashWithRainbows Well this is just awesome :D
Dovah: Merry old England :D
Dark_Horst: YAAAY :D
I forget the birthday of other people so much.
Don't even remember my mothers.
Cypresswolf: Nah, that'll be cool, I've always wanted to have grey hair, but I wouldn't want to dye it that colour.
AJIsAwesome: talk about a birthday present :D
MLP_Brovakiin: then that explains why your exited about a moped
DashWithRainbows Haha i know the feeling all to well,
MadSurge: IKR? :D
killerpony7733 You gettin' pissed on your 18th then?
Because I might.
DashWithRainbows Not a drinker~ but i'm certainly gonna enjoy a few drinks maybe and all
Dovah: Why is that :|
Ex Deus!
and suddenly Wrek is going to bumtaze all the bitches
BITCHES LOVE BUMTAZES
MLP_Brovakiin: I believe he means "pissed" as in drunk.
DashWithRainbows Nothing big is gonna be held for me but i'm surely gonna get a fair amount of money
my god that sounded so wrong
Wreky the wrecking ball gona viking his way to VALHALLA!
Not even 30 and already got some grey flecks in my red beard - though the grey got my cousin David around 28...and hes a little over a year older than me
I was afk what happened?
MLP_Brovakiin: in us most people drive dirt bikes and atvs around at like 12 or younger :P
Hipster-Pony: Lots. You're gonna have to either scroll up or be more specific :3
Wrek Aren't you getting the issue with moving fast again?
Are you a spider?
tSparx: I'll just watch this XD
Nice killerpony7733. I'll probably be gettig a new gaming mouse, some cash and maybe a large bottle of Jack D. Seeing that this laptop was an extremely early b-day present...
Haha, excited young teens talking about getting drunk on their 21st/18th birthday, hahaha.
jontron plays slender...]
I'm to lazy to read all those chats :P
Dovah: Oh, I have had a motor bike scince I was 13, but just not a road leagal one :P
tSparx: Not me. :P
i dont feel like playing anything right now
DashWithRainbows Well i could afford a pretty god damn powerful gaming laptop which costs about 20k in my currency
tSparx: have you had a drink called The Four Horsemen?
Bronysith: He did?
What's your currency?
:) My first time drinking is why I do my heavy drinking at home - helps to have a bar in walking distance ^_^
Mine is a pretty good one, got it for £330 from PC World.
Dovah: Nope. I don't really drink (except my love wine)
I'm thinking about it but i'm mostly getting alot of cash. DashWithRainbows DK(Danish Krones/crowns for english peps)
Wish they still served steaks though...
I domn
I don't drink either
:) but then again, the chef at the bar never marinated with whiskey
O__o more Deus Ex?
his voice kinda reminds me of cry
Well, if you have the cash, go for a gaming desktop.
those are some serious veins O_o
SHE UUUUGGGGGLLLYYY
Laptops are good and all, but it's bloody hard to upgrade them unlike desktops.
DashWithRainbows Sadly i lack alot of space for that laptop is my only and best option due to mobility and less size~
Fair enough.
I had to do the same.
Is this the original Deus Ex?
/me has never had steak. :D
But I'll be giving my mom this laptop when I get a good desktop.
too much beer
AJIsAwesome: You are missing out :P
MLP_Brovakiin: I know. :D
And by "doesn't taste like piss" I really mean "isn't beer," haha
MLP_Brovakiin: Do you ever smoke (not cigarettes, the other thing)?
AJIsAwesome: when you turn 21, I'll grill you one with my own recipe :)
DashWithRainbows I live in a horribly small apartment with three family members and yeah space in the room i loan is less then ideal
tSparx Don't drink Strongbow.
Cypresswolf: Okay. :)
It tastes horrible.
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GargleBlaster
under real life section
And being a cider, you won't get that much of a buzz from it.
My sister brought me a bag of candy for my birthday. :3 om nom nom
Go for vodka, double shot it.
tSparx: Nope, I plan on never taking any drugs what so ever. besides my dad would kill me :P
I would drink a GargleBlaster in a heart-beat
I would too
Barbetos|AtWork: Nice.
tSparx: I cant yet :( or maybe thats a good thing :P
Agh!
MLP_Brovakiin: Well, either AJIsAwesome isn't missing out (my opinion), or you are.
I am so jelly. I really wanted that derpy AJIsAwesome =P
Dovah: Canna what?
Seeing your name reminds me
Speaking of double shots - I owe a few people some drink recipes :)
tSparx: drink a gargle blaster
tSparx: There is a difference between steak & drugs :|
Barbetos|AtWork: I'm sorry. I SERIOUSLY didn't know i would get it. :$
Do we have anything more specific than this? http://cheezburger.com/6568126464
killerpony7733 Ah, didn'tknow you would have that small of a space. I only have my own room since my bro moved out, so that's where the desktop is going to be. I can always hook up my TV screen to serve as an 2 screen for it.
Barbetos|AtWork: I NEVER win ANY raffles. :$
MLP_Brovakiin: Steak? I thought you were talking about drinking, kind sir, nvm!
Its cool. Your just really lucky. Its better that it is going to a Brony.
MLP_Brovakiin: Hahaha
bronystater
I got a coloring book at least lol
tSparx: Haha derp :P
Barbetos|AtWork: Thanks. It's kind of nice to win something everyonce in a while.
I got the Midnight magic people, Rina-chan, a few of the con people, Cypresswolf, MysteryBen to sign it.
I got some emails to write :D The looks I got from some I shared my pony drink book - They had no idea drink recipes were ponified at all
Barbetos|AtWork: Nice! :O
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Friendship is Magic Season 1 DVD Pre-orders hit #3 on Amazon
SafariMonkey: We can't even be sure that's legit -- really easy to put the Hasbro logo on something and post it up.
Anyone?
Cypresswolf: How could they not know? :D
How did I see the tweet before this post?
SafariMonkey: I will hear from the mouth of Hub or Hasbro, and no one else.
DashWithRainbows The living room is just next to this door frame and the bathroom and other bedroom is just about the same away too. and the kitchen yeah everything is so tight that the living room can be reached by just the few steps
tSparx: yeah I know
Hi
DashWithRainbows It gets really bad when we argue here at how we use the space and how everyone doesn't get enough space do this and that...
Ouch, that is a small apartment killerpony7733. That seems something I'd like if I lived by myself.
AJIsAwesome: I started searching when I first heard about the pony drinking game - first found 6 for the mane 6, then found ones for Spike, Trixie, & Vinyl Scratch....and the list kept growing
Hello again guys ^^
SafariMonkey: We'll know when we know, and trust me, you'll know when we know, because that's all we'll talk about all day. Every time someone logs on, "Hi SafariMonkey, did you hear we have the release date!?"
Litwick: Hi! :)
DashWithRainbows Yeah something like that. But three family members along with me and having little to no privacy is annoying as heck...
Hello Litwick :)
I would guess so.
DashWithRainbows It kinda prevents me from talking with friends on skype or something along those lines i get no use of my headset due to this~
Cypresswolf: The Spike one's probably the only one I haven't heard of before.
lol
hi
We did have it at some point where we had 2 families living in this house.
Heya Applejack2012
Not mention 3 of them were small kids.
And I really hate kids.
^
The most difficult one I found is called a Sonic Rainboom - a giant jello shooter that takes 6+ hours to make - you have to refridgerate after each layer to get the rainbow look
Cypresswolf: Wow. :O
Hi everypony :)
hi
cachi01|phone: Hello! :)
Never tried making one myself - though I'd like to try it, its not worth making a single one - its more for parties
Hello cachi01|phone :)
If you hate kids, start a sweat shop, that'll show em.
hi cachi01|phone
Panda|LOL: LOL :D
Oh my god Panda XD
^^
DashWithRainbows Mines three adults and me being the almost adult too. But yeah the size here gets to us at times cause we end up with arguements and bark at each other cause the size and all of it that kinda makes things diffucult at times
Panda|LOL XD
Panda LOLWUT

/me hugs Pikachu
Ass_Ketchum: Really?

If only Africa had more mosquito nets, then every year we could save millions of mosquitoes from dying of AIDS.
BladedWings: MmHmm, I've been there.

AJIsAwesome: nnope

Freefall29: I don't think there is one.

stream just died tonight
ok good. ad block plus didn't block the stream. :)
hey guys you know the cans i was talking about i cleaned out my computer desk
How is everyone?
What are you talking about.guys? Wrek is streaming the HL3 demo >_>
speaking of half-life, black mesa comes out this week. thursday I think
cachi01|muffin: Well played :).
it comes out in 3 days
Freefall its going.to be so awesome
So there is a stream going on?
I should play Half Life at some point.
I thought the Black Mesa mod was out
I should. But I never will.
i need to refresh
Meanwhile: you really should, its awesome
I'm sure it is but I really don't care.
Hey Sumica
i guess not then
Hey Wrek
Moopy theres a HL3 stream
Demo
13i discovered Half Life Source is too old a version of source to do fullscreen noborder which is laaaame
Trolling is against the rules cachi.
/me hides
im a big fan of halo dude
Meanwhile: It is?
/me puts Freefall29 in a full nelson
/)_=
Moopy: do you have half-life 2 or another source engine game?
i have most all the games dude
He probably doesn't even know what you just said.
Shizuka, really? O_o I thought you could fullscreen HL
Moopy: well you can get black mesa, its a remake of half-life and its free.
Moopy!!!!
13fullscreen noborder is a different thing
oh.
all the source engine games? Yeah sure
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Waiting Games / Dash's Insanity / Mountain Monologue Part 3
is it only for PC's
yes
then i don't have it
I think its supposed to work on mac.
13rather than fullscreen, which hijacks the GPU threads for that entire screen (leading to flashes as you alt tab in or out), it's a window exactly as big as your monitor, and without the titlebar or border controls
How can you have all source engines.and all half life.games if you dont have the PC ones?
well i have a sony compaq valo computer system
Im going to try making a 4x normal scale rainbow dash in plastic
SuperBrony63: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1zbGFGQTq0&feature=player_embedded Are you seeing this?
cachi01|muffin: attention whore
13so looks no different from fullscreen at native resolution, except you can alt-tab fluently as though it were any other window
Moopy: ok nvm then. the offical website says it atm only supports windows. sorry
Is it me or is chat terribly pointless today?
its all good dude
/me puts Freefall29 in a full nelson
13one downside is vista and up use a full time desktop compositing method that renders your desktop similar to how dedicated graphics programs do, so there's some extra overhead of the compisitor having to incorporate the game window, rather than the game having full control
/me begs for mercy
Meanwhile: it isn't time for fun yet
Meanwhile: We just haven't found a good topic to discuss yet.
/me puts Freefall29 in a figure 4 leglock as well
13but if you have a card that supports source well in the first place, the problem is pretty much nonexistent
Heh dat big shizuka mod talk
AJIsAwesome: we are talking about half-life and ponies. that's pretty awesome to me
http://www.dorkly.com/comic/39493/the-most-beautiful-thing-in-the-world FUCK YES
Shizuka first i need a pc lol

Hey guys EA are even bigger money whores noe http://derpy.me/sqaHJ look!
*now
rather he said he was going to go out to do things

ohai Ryunosuke
hi
gabe newell is a very wise man.
valve will burn before EA buys it
/me goes into cachi01|muffin s r34 file
13gaben's already gone on record today saying he'd see valve disintegrate first than be swallowed up by a bigger company
Hello Ryunosuke
OH GOD WHY
Ryunosuke: Hello~
TOLD YA
13that and there's a report from a securities firm that valve is worth closer to $2.5bil
Because it looks like an evil version of the one you currently use?
Worth the weight
that and it's paintable
Bronysith: You think I'm going to write fanfics without some action figures to play out the scenes?
dat worth
Awesome.
flutter_spin: what scenes? one of my OCs walking into his r34 thing?
lol
well valve provides a unique service to the gaming industry, one that others try to emulate, but fail at (EA I AM LOOKING AT YOU)
Shizuka: Given Activision or EA would swallow Valve up, that's probably a good thing, that Valve would go down first.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASNMQwcbax8 this brought tears to my face
oh hey Everlasting_Joy

PillowPoni|Phone: Hopefully you do, I would get so bored If my charger broke :/
Bronysith: Well turn around Gaston
I always pretend to like her when I'm at her house
so will the season 1 dvd get a region 2 relase
flutter_spin: ikr
Belle is my favorite disney character
And not because she looks glorious in that yellow dress
Just cuz I'm afraid she won't let Gen talk to me
MLP_Brovakiin; this was two months ago. Insanity already happened.
okay if you want to see this next link, PM me
She sounds like she's just trying to control her.
Especially after what happened with her friend Jenna
Yea
What happened?
PillowPoni|Phone: 2 months! :O jeez I respect you for that, I wouldn't last a week :P
inb4 screams of terror
/me enters fallout shelter
and no. you can't join me
/me stalks Freefall29
MLP_Brovakiin; I started losing it the first day
/me sends army of super mutants at Freefall29 s base
Jenna yelled at Gen's mom. Now all of a sudden, Gen isn;t allowed to talk to her because she's a "bad influence"
/me shoots all of them with fawkes
yeah, ok, jenna's a bad influence :p
whatever
so will the season 1 dvd get a region 2 relase

fawkes is my favorite follower in fallout 3

Elips... es
/me kidnaps Michael
/me is scared
Ryunosuke: possible mlp reference there?
alexxm: you really should stop kidnaping people. you don't have a license or anything man.
i got to hide before alexxm kidnaps someone
firendship IS magic as we all know :)
Freefall29: actually he does
/me picks up Michael and rubs his belly
Bronysith: he does? well carry on with your abductions
O.o
Freefall29 heres my license qualifed to abduct anyone anywhere
Gen's mom: anyone who yells at me is pure evil. Guys cannot date guys, girls cannot date girls, You have to do what I say because I said so. I don't know how to talk in a normal voice, girls must always wear skirts long or else they look like a slut, girls must not wear pants
CUE SONIC SAYS
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTxO_pgMqys
bleh why this minecraft world take so long to load?
I suck at flying jets.....
alexxm: let me see that license. *grabs* hmm... licensed in 2005. expires in 2015.... this ID seems valid.
MLP_Brovakiin; I get $100 from my parents every two weeks (cause that's when dad gets paid). Its not enough to live off of, since the car needs gas and food and my phone card is about $50 as it is
i am so glad there are no false gamers in chat today <3
damn flash crashed
/me throws r63 dust on Major
Bronysith: because you killed all the false gamers
long skirts* :P
Bronysith i cant remembe any false gamer being here lol
/me throws r63 dust on Michael
/me reflects r63 dust
cachi01|muffin: Major is a false gamer
PillowPoni|Phone: Oh fair enough :(
wait. she thinks girls shouldnt wear pants?
/me noogies Michael
/me evades the r53 dust
MLP_Brovakiin; yeah.
Major? Really?
*r63
I mean Moopy is
But Major?
/me pokes alexxm
cachi01|muffin: yup
yeah Michael
All right, I must depart. It's DINNER time!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI4ZOT63MGc&feature=BFa&list=FL5QyBGi4t1uDa0FwakXNeYQ
Everlasting_Joy: Bye! :)
bye Everlasting_Joy
bye Everlastin_Joy
bye Everlasting_Joy
AJIsAwesome: never played skyward sword. is it good?
Oh Boy im so hungry i can eat an Everlasting_Joy!
sweet music for my ears :D
She is ALWAYS wearing a long skirt. it freaks me out o_o
Freefall29: Some people are biased. I LOVE the game, while some people think it's bad.
/me turns Michael into a robot and unleashes him on bronystate
gen needs to get the fuck out of there asap :P
Some of the game mechanics may get a little annoying, but overall it's a terrific game, IMO.
kill.crush.destroy.swag
/me EMPs Michael
Yea, except her mom doesn't want her to move out EVER and has guardianship oiver her BECAUSE SHE SAID SO
Michael: We actually did that at BFF. :D
brb food
is she over 18?
ok
Yea
then legally she can leave right now
if she wants
lol
oh yeah did you have fun there AJIsAwesome
alexxm: I had a GREAT time. Still tired from it, too. :$
im pretty sure
cachi01|muffin: he thinks being able to kill everyone in games is wrong, like children or important quest givers and it should always be banned, the moment you are unable to kill something ruins immersion, ergo he is a false gamer for not wanting emersion in a game
AJIsAwesome so what happened there
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwTt2JOULXg
immersion
Bronysith BEING ABLE TO KILL EVERYONE IS AWESOME!
yeah thats discriminatory
cachi01|muffin: thats why i love fallout 1 and 2
still need to play 2
Freefall29 its a videogame who da fuk cares who you kill?
ive meet some really evil children in my life
^
yeah, i wanted to kill some kids on skyrim but the game dont let me :[[
^
cachi01|muffin: umm.... I know that. I was backing up bronysith. I just don't get why there is a double standard that's all.
i dowloaded the killable children mod 4 sjyrim
Michael: i'm sure a mod for that exists
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/10/ywGXBSzcn020p7VbDTTJSw2.jpg the answer to why none of us can kill kids nowadays in games
Michael: You worry me sometimes...
God_The_Atheist: doesnt count though
yeah Freefall29
GODDAMIT SOCCER MOMS
MLP_Brovakiin: some of the kids are very annoying
Michael: you cant kill them but you can launch them a few hundred feet in the air, no mods
Bronysith: and the government, don't forget with all that FCC and decency crap
13what are we flame warring over today?
Bronysith why can't we just kill the soccer mums
fucking soccer moms need to get the fuck over it
then again. soccer moms run the government so duh
Michael: Good point, like that Braith areshole kid from Whiterun
i hate government and corperations
we need a V
Hi BronyState.
MLP_Brovakiin: for example
how are things Bobeh
ohai Bobeh
Heya Bobeh
hi Bobeh
God_The_Atheist: corporations make the awesome games we love. so they're not all bad. just a few bad apples that spoiled the rest is all.
alexxm: Gooooooood
d
why don't we let anonymous run the goverment
13In this thread, discussing issues bigger than you are under the auspices of having an understanding of the whole
NO WTF NO NONONONONO WTF NO WHYYYYY
*cough EA cough*
alexxm: we all would die
alexxm: cause they are anarchist?
GODDAMIT XBOX 360 S
Freefall29 why would happen
cachi01|muffin: what?
ugh
and Bronysith whats the worst that happen
corperations only exist to make profit in whatever way possible
i still need to play fallout 2
13um duh?
alexxm: i've seen scary things from them. they can be very, very mean when they wanna be.
13hey bronystate let's play a game
13if you could ban all corporate profits, would you?
MLP_Brovakiin i accidentaly touched the goddamn sensible to touch the open disk button.
Shizuka: no. then valve doesn't get all their hard earned cash.
id ban profit itself corprate and otherwise
Freefall29 so that would be an effective crime dettermet right?
I HAVE NO PART IN THIS CONVERSATION
no then they woulnd have funding to make better games
dammit Bobeh
nothingtodohere.jpg
cachi01|muffin: Haha I still have the old black xbox :P
I WAS TALKING ABOUT IMMERSION IN A GAME
alexxm: they do a lot of stuff for lulz man.
Theres bound to be some unforseen consequence to such a thing so i would not.
/me dont know what to do
not about stupid corporation bullshit
13Congratulations God_The_Atheist, you haven't the most basic understanding of economics and have disqualified yourself from discussing them!
13Have a nice day.
Shizuka: =.(\
/me that feel when you tab back to chat and want to tab out again
Freefall29 i thought that was why they did everything
alexxm: look. its just a bad idea a super effective trolling organization run a system that has power over a nation and other nations.
we wernt even talking about economics genuis we were talking about killable children in videogames
Spectrum_Rush: I would do that, but I've got nothing to tab out to.
thats why i suggested it Freefall29
God_The_Atheist: yeah. then you started talking about hating coprorations and wanting to ban all profits.
yes then i did but origonally we were talking about killing children
I loved when i blew up megaton in Fallout3
alexxm: oh. lol right. nvm
Aaaaaand now he's insulted an admin. RUN MAN
Bobeh: who
13when in doubt, drop a grenade and trust the user is stupid enough to set it off, then wander off for dinner
13\o
Bobeh: run for the hills!
I'm gonna go to bed now, considering the fact that I slept through my alarm this morning :P
Hey guys im back and i saw the house burned
Freefall29:God_The_Atheist
Woah.

What did I just do?
Gnight MLP_Brovakiin
night MLP_Brovakiin
Night MLP_Brovakiin
Bobeh: oh dear.....
Moopy: House?

/me hugs BladedWings, alexxm, Dovah, Michael, thelonepony, cachi01|muffin, and Freefall29 <3
hugs <3
I bloke it.
Night MLP_Brovakiin
God_The_Atheist: profit is the money a company gets back from paying for production of a product and service. they use it to keep doing what they do.
/me is hugged
jinx :D
G'night everypony! :)
yeah the house the gareage was melted the roof top was gane the windows was busted everything was gone
GilDash: Night! :)

Night GilDash
nite GilDash
bye GilDash
g'night GilDash
BRB playing Deadlight i bought it a month ago and i havent played it yet lol
Good night GilDash
Night GilDash
Moopy: Woah. How did it all happen?
so just throw a grenade and hope for the best ?
Gnight GilDash
Hey otakon
ohai otakon
hiya guys
ohai otakon. :)
what's up?
otakon: sup
Moopy how did the fire start
hi otakon
the company could just do what they do to provide to the soceity because if they dont then theyll lose there jobs and no longer be able to benifit from the other goods and services produced by the society ( theoretically)
Well it hannped yesterday when my mom and my step dad went to work they saw it on the news that morning when i was sleeping
My Brother is downstairs yelling at Super Smash Brothers.
how are things otakon
hmmm
okay I guess
brb
Bobeh: Which one?
I didn't se the fire at all it was just burned untill my mom took me over there and saw the whole thing
AJIsAwesome: Brawl.
Bobeh: Okay.
I prefer Melee over Brawl, though.
AJIsAwesome: yeah. melee is better
AJIsAwesome: BY THE WAY. I LIKE YOUR NAME. Hard to find an Applejack fan.
Cause alot of people were outside talking about it and i was crazy as hell
Bobeh: Thanks. :)
http://youtu.be/SoHeWgLvlXI This i samazing
is**
Freefall29: I like Brawl more. Just because Melee feels really tight or controlled. In brawl you can jump around and not get dragged down to the floor right away.
Her mom apparently has guardianship over her so....
and i saw the dresser was burned to as well
Which makes absolutely no sense
And when I got back, the DNA evidence was gone.
Bobeh: True, but the characters are floaty and the sound effects are par at best.
Bobeh: I just felt the SSE was boring and nothing was explained, online is pure crap, more clones, and make a stage feature is too basic for making anything creative. that's just me.
WHY NO STREAM?
You really don't feel that "oomph" in Brawl than in Melee. You feel like you dealt a bone-shatering SMASH, and it feels gratifying.
Rustymeat: there's no need of stream to get fun on bronystate :)
Michael: yeah. the chat is the fun for bronystate.
Are we all talking about how Melee is better than Brawl?
IKR
SpeedyBolt: yeah. brawl is fun with friends but they messed up some stuff in it.
also without stream u can post vid links :$
One of my favorite SFX in Melee is Mario's meteor smash. The SFX he makes when it connects is SO satisfying.
Me and my mom didn't go nike riding it was to late over here and its like 7:15pm over here
I like Brawl, it's a great game, but I would prefer Melle IMO.
i mean bike
*Melee*
I miss my fast-paced Melee
Are online matches still available on Brawl?
I really don't like modern nintendo. these days they are making more spin off titles that took little effort to make rather then the main series. they just slap mario on another tennis game. lazy
hi
thats some big words you got there
Okay.
:P
They still never explained how the Halberd got taken over at the beginning.
hi Hipster-Pony
ohai Hipster-Pony
thelonepony: hi
SpeedyBolt: I didn't have alot of fun running through an area then having to stay in one place and kill 50 enimies.
Michael: hi
are we waiting to watch something?
It's pretty damn easy.
Hipster-Pony: we are playing the waiting game....
IMO, the floating island would've been great backstory for Sonic. But nope. He arrives at the VERY LAST moment out of nowhere.
...That WAS never explained, really.
AJIsAwesome: that ticked me off a bit. it ticked me off more he just attacks the main villian, knowing nothing about whats going on
Freefall29: lol
:P
Freefall29: Yep. Me too.
AJIsAwesome: I thought the part where sonic jumped in was pretty damn cool.
I mean, we go through all of this shit
Bobeh: Me too. I just wished they explained how.
and then suddenly, RIGHT THERE, Sonic out of nowhere.
http://derpy.me/n1npH LMAO
But they reverted him back to this Pre-Chapter 4 Attitude.
Freefall29: Oh DEFINITELY. I wished Earthbound selled more here. :(

AJIsAwesome: Sonic was going fast, because he had to. But he went too fast and ended up in the nintendo universe. He was going too fast to stop and he ran into Taboo's Wings Of Death. Make sense?
Bobeh: Yep. :P
Guys im scared here my step dad is argueing my mom and i hate that
i thought sonic went so fast that he flew into the sun
Bobeh: that would technically be a plot and brawl can't have any of that.
It had a plot, Freefall29
Michael, funny how I have this game somewhere
SpeedyBolt: :D
never really played it though
A very unexplained one..but..
Freefall29: It's a fighter. Nobody plays fighters fo a plot.
Freefall29: They play fighters to fight.
I'm wondering here
Would the SSE have been better with voices?
Moopy: it's ok...everything will be ok
Bobeh: yeah. but atleast fighting games like mortal kombat EXPLAIN what the hell is going on.
SpeedyBolt: Nah. Not for me.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1zbGFGQTq0
WATCH THAT AND LOVE IT!
SpeedyBolt: I'm glad they were able to make a story without them talking.
otakon, I already did
I personally cant imagine how they'd screw up some of the voices.
otakon: Saw that earlier. BEST THING EVER
Maybe in the states it's 21
^
SpeedyBolt: voices would'nt be needed. they could have just done text screens. again, lazy
dammit I'm late
otakon: I LOVED the DJ Mystery bit. :D
DOUBLE EATER!
otakon, now watch this and be intrigued http://youtu.be/SoHeWgLvlXI
Pinkie's bit is my favorite
saw it CrimsonPhoenix
damn you know who I haven't seen in awhile?
CriticKitten
otakon: dat franky
I'm gonna close this chat for a bit
About to knock the crap out of Acid Ace
Michael: agreed...SUPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPER!
SUPERRR Franky!!
I love how most of deadlights achievements are references to some.guns & roses songs :)
*Moopy gets a little shaked from his parents argueing each other*
/me says Indeed
/me comforts Moopy
thanks man
Micheal i do
how many OP fans are there?!
Michael: one piece?
i think i feel cool now thanks dude
yeah Bronysith
never got into one piece
Imma fan!
/me kidnaps thelonepony
It looks like she can leave if she's 18. Her mom's full of shit.
My Little BronyState: Waiting Is Magic
SuperBrony63 good to hear madmax made $400 for repairs!
*buffer is magic*
damn it why does it have to be me!
thelonepony no idea
>_> I love waiting <_<
the waiting game sucks, i'm gonna play hungry, hungry hippos
yeah me to i love waiting
/me feeds Freefall29 to the hippos
I'm listening to Dr Whooves and Assistant.
let's play the quiet game :)
Fluttershy is the champ
we cannot beat her
My little waiting is cool
it is useless to try
^
Fluttershy is the staremaster.
/me shows thelonepony his duct tape collection "if you insist"
Fluttershy is a dull dull pony.
QUIET GAME
one does not simply beat fluttershy
int the quiet game
*mmmmmmm*
Derpy is the funniest pony ever
One can however beat Fluttershy with a stick fairly easily.
dat is cheat
*zzzzzz*
bad Meanwhile
Meanwhile: you could beat fluttershy with a twig
Or a rolled up newspaper.
so how are things thelonepony
Michael: I rather like One Piece. Friendship seems to be the over-arcing theme.
Meanwhile: or if you just yell at her loud enough, she might end up hurting herself
great alexxm and you?
Kinixys: yeah, i'm a big fan too
Kinixys, indeed it is.
i'm good thelonepony sorry about the whole kidnaping thing
Her mom doesn't let her make her own decisions on anything. Gen did not have to continue going to school, she didn't want to, her mom forced her
alexxm: i thought you attacked thelonepony, not kidnap
Kinixys: also the plot is very catchy
er what Freefall29 why would i do that
well i would of bein bleeding to death right now...
*zzzzzz*
/me gives a pillow to LunarRepublicGuard
Well, I can kinda understand if she wanted her to go to school.

They die to one shotgun round.
what?
when?
LunarRepublicGuard: :'(
Since always assuming you can aim.
I've unloaded whole clips into those bitches
at point blank
Clearly you have the targetting skills of a cheese sandwich then.
I sent the bitch a clip. bitches love clips
when the HELL can you kill one with a single shotgun round?
LunarRepublicGuard: no not FS
Literally since the game first came out.
a cheese sandvich wut :I
bullshit
BULLSHIT I SAY
There's an achievement for killing a witch in one shot.
Oh, hello Slenderman.
LunarRepublicGuard: You do realize the only Republic died with Rome? It's a pathetic government home to dictator like Ceaser.
I find it convenient that all these zombies are dressed in grey.
13sec
You just have to walk up to them and unload a shotgun into their back.
aha
CONDITIONS
you have to shoot her in the back of the head
13except shizu doesn't have shotgun :3
at point blank range
13you just headshot
Well no shit point blank.
okay have we played the same game?
Is it just me or did the video pause?
*headshot slenderman*
What are you trying to do? Snipe with a shotgun?
bc I've seen those bitches take the whole team's firepower for several seconds
what is this. xbox 360?
GO SHIZU GO SHIZU GO
the hell
What about headshots guard?
.
That was a fast zombie.
Headshots don't affect witches except from the hunting rifle which I think staggers them. Or at least it does in the second game.
Pew pew
Good start there.
*4 the glory of the NLR*
Slenderman: dont make me trap you next to a black hole
lol
/me gives Slenderman a hug "I missed you, sir."
guys. dinner. brb
Doctor, a black hole would drag you in as well, it's force is too strong to escape.
Shizuka: the gun-toting giggle-box
YAAAAAAAAAAY SHIZU!

the hub family movie that is on right now is gremlins. gremlins, on the family movie night. what kind of family is THAT movie for?
Mmm, I liked L4D more than 2, but I think 2 plays better.
Herostar, Shizuka's soloing in Left 4 Dead, and she's enjoying the dialog trees.
the_real_pony_1604: My family 6_9
So mister tardis boy. Happen to know where that Master of yours is? I heard you shot him. You missed. He's going to kill you. He already has Miss Twilight Sparkle as well
ohhh this is interesting
One of my Cure clones is missing D:
There's only three, there should be four
Where is he???
Slenderman: sir i am a time lord we have a little trick to avoid that
/me giggles.
Care to explain why you hesitated Doctor? Do you still like him?
Will you take your rp somewhere else?
Slenderman now wait a minute, are you saying you are trying to scare the man who's been through complete hell, faced creatures making you look like my chiuaha, and dare think this would set him off in the slightest? you must be mistaken
agreed
brb
the doctor needs time to think
He's mad!
Slenderman: you wish
That Doctor stopped caring and confined himself in his Tardis!
Yes, the doctor is a madman with a box
He stopped caring after DITZY
Again, knock off the rp.
Pls.
yeah, lol
AFTER HE WANTED DITZY TO JOIN YOU> SHE REFUSED AND YOU STOPPED CARING
DoctorWhoovesV10 now if there's anything you and me learnt, there's one thing you don't put in a trap unless you want that trap to fail, and would you care to explain what or who that is?
Slenderman: younare going to fail sir
Maybe he drowned in the grass?
*facehoove*
YOU ENDED UP SLEEPING WITH ALL OF PONYVILLE AND ADMITTED YOU WERE A PONY
Slenderman: so
I smell a kick or two

Pyro's are cool, I still prefer Demopan.
hello everypony
Anyways, TF2
/me prefers Soldier and Engie
wish I knew the server password
Shizuka: ya know that your name only appears as Shizuka on steam right now, searching for kamishizuka usually wont result in the correct person...
Go Shizu :3 I wubs you
Suffice to say, I was fed up with PSO2's use of Gameguard, so I finally sent in that e-mail complaining about GG. But since it has to be in Japanese, I used Google Translate. And I had to reword it a lot in order to try to get Google Translate to translate it to Japanese they'd understand.
lol

Scoot-Scootaloo I got one I don't use.

Scoot-Scootaloo related http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/image/339
Scrap is made by smelting weapons down
And is used to craft and trade for weapons.
I only have the rainblower and normal flamethrower.
Scoot-Scootaloo any regular item is worth one scrap, but I'll check your load-out and see if there's anything I like. Steam name?
3 scrap = 1 reclaimed. 3 reclaimed = 1 refined.
shizuka, check friends list?

Scoot-Scootaloo I sent you a friend request, so message me to trade when you get the chance. Also, don't get rid of your tradable Solemn Vow. I'll take that for a Backburner.
I'm gonna stay in chat, but if anypony needs me. I'm gonna be using the source sdk
hey Freefall29
hey Bronysith....
Hellooooo
if smell still persists, sprinkle some baking soda on the area while damp
Hello Barbetos
sup barbetos
Unnr: did somepony say sprinkle!
hi Barbetos
if still nasty, you can try mixing a few drops of dish soap with about a 1/2 cup of Hydrogen peroxide
Hello Barbetos
Hello MrMalk
and remember, if all else fails, fire is probably the answer
Barbetos: Hello! :)
MrMalk: Hi! :)
Sup guys
twilight_sprinkle: That would be bad in this occasion...
O_o
this could be bad
Shizuka got an extra flamethrower!
omfg a medical timeout
djokovic you cheating prick
Listen to that crowd twilight_sprinkle
Unnr: ikr
:3
08,01twilight_sprinkle: his sounds excititng, ithink ill put it on and cath the end
Unnr: the crowd really made this match amazng tbh, the play isnt that great
Aww. I was going to ask for that Degreaser.
twilight_sprinkle: Murray's play is so much more interesting on grass
brb restroom
dammit Andy siddown and take a break
Shizuka: good luck
Go ballboy, grab that towel!~
cool music
Unnr: depends on his choice. when playing Federer he made the mistake of chasing every ball own and he ended up getting tired in the 4th
Unnr: he shouldve been more atacking in the first two sets of this match imo
twilight_sprinkle: True, but his play is much more dynamic and he tended to have less predictable volley, he has been getting wayy to set in a pattern with his returns
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Vocal Music: Let This Be The End / Keep Faith / Fluttershy ft. Lolikko
KILL IT WITH FI-YAH!
Unnr: thing is, USO is actually faster than Wim nowadays, so he shouldve attacked more n this match
FI-YAAAH!
Annnn serving for the championship
15-0
twilight_sprinkle: True enough, but I think he was trying to avoid the whole getting burned out early problem
much to his disadvantage
Unnr: attackign game takes waaaaay less than all the defending he has done
pfffffffffffff

Oh mannnnn
13meanwhile timed out

Nittany_Discord are you feeling colorless today?
Also twilight_sprinkle, its 76 years
Unnr: still, if Federer wasnt so unlucky with the extended break and game drop, he wouldve won in 3 sets i bet :3
I guess you can say that.
Nittany_Discord i don't see light blue on your sentences
I actually don't mind how long it takes. Even the premiere is aired, we still have to wait.
*premiere date*

Heh i like blossom
I would like to talk about the episodes........but i would get a permaban for spoilers
buttercup is best pony- I mean powerpuff girls
My Little Pony i LOOVE DONT CARE IF ITS cool OR NOT
Unnr: it didnt fall apart, Federer just picked up his game
-LunarRepublicGuard- barrel rolling
00,03Snowflake: What did I say about the caps...
Scoot-Scootaloo You bet!
twilight_sprinkle: Murray was totally getting sloppy in the end there
Unnr: well whatddya expect chasing down every single hit on a grass court, of course youll get tired
but i love and miss RAINBOWDASHY D,',',',:
Hello everyone :3
twilight_sprinkle: True that. Also I forgot how huge djokovic's ears are
we all do.....
Hello oni_link
oni_link: Hi! :)
Unnr: hes an elf :3
hi oni_link
Man, you're more obnoxious than my brother.
And he's bi polar.
We all do, but we still have to wait.
00,03We all miss Rainbow, but we just have to wait until her work is perfect enough to get shown to us!
How are you LunarRepublicGuard , AJIsAwesome and Obsidian ? :)
So wait rainbow dash is dead?
ITS PERFECT!!!!!!!! i will allways love her!!!!!! miss her so muchhhhhh'
oni_link: Pretty good. How about you?
Rainbow Dash? :S Scoot-Scootaloo?
Snowflake: Chill on the caps.
AJIsAwesome: Great even though today was not a productive day at work. Im just in a good mood all around :P
Unnr: Andy will probably play a lot better from now on, confidence-wise
oni_link: just being on guard duty
twilight_sprinkle: True, being validated with a championship is a huge confidence booster
LunarRepublicGuard: hows guard duty? lol you didnt fall asleep on firewatch did you?
>_> no
I swear. SWAG.MOV is probably the only PONY.MOV that I'm genuinely looking forward to. I really don't care for this series' style of humor, but I'm really curious how it's going to end.
Unnr: funny how Lendl never smiles :P
LunarRepublicGuard: its okay if you did :P haha
:)
Kandarihu: I liked em all, they got incrementally better as they came along IMO. and thats why Im here now :D
i found those .MOV videos so offensive
crush kill destroy swag
superretroworld: in what way
I liked most of them, but the one I can't really stand to watch again is Party.mov.
Heh the egineer thinks trixe is best pony pfft please Rainbow Dash is the best pony
oni_link, you do understand the actual screenings of those videos, besides APPLE.MOV and SPIKE.MOV are not allowed here, right?
twilight_sprinkle: Srs business
I just can't wait for swag.mov
I HAVE FIVE CURES RUNNING AROUND MY HOUSE!!!
whats that thing at the botton right there with those 3 different colors there?
Kandarihu: I do. And the thing for me was that I watched them before I gave the show a try. And now I genuinely like the show and its thanks to that series and YTPs
APPLE.MOV and SPIKE.MOV are fine here. The rest are questionable to flat-out censored.
ERRR... SIX!!! WHEN DID THE SIXTH ONE HAPPEN???
oni_link, I see.
Freefall29: well think about it, they all hate each other, raritys fat, pinkies an alchololic, and they changed fluttershys face
KILL IT WITH FI-YAAAAAH!
Swag.mov will end with everyone being killed I think
superretroworld: she was different in apple.mov
I dislike the .MOV series, but I won't ruin it for peho like it.ople w
people who like it
and then the stream was over :<
youre a good person MASF123 :P
SWAG.MOV might tie in the Tumblr series Ask Jappleack.
Cypresswolf Barbetos AJIsAwesome you guys here?
Sorry keyboard buttons get stuck.
twilight_sprinkle: its still going on though
MrMalk: I am
Nittany_Discord maybe
Nittany_Discord: I think ultimately thats whats gonna happen
Unnr: the one on the USO site?
I liked the first two, Shed.MOV was okay, and I hated Party.MOV
MrMalk: Yep.
yah
so why is their robots attack?
this song <3
Unnr: odd, mine says broadcast is over
Magic.MOV is okay, IMO.
oni_link, I wish I were a good person, or just pure hearted.
I'm back everypo- What the...
though right now its just showing pretty picutures of flags
Is anyone here interested in editing a Borderlands crossover fic? :)
Annn there it ends
hi lowfn
AJIsAwesome: ik, i cant take pinkie seriously now
:3
this song
na na na na na na
MASF123: whats stopping ya? :)
sexy song
Nyan~
Vanacus my friend Nightmaire Moon loves to write and/or edit fanfics.
shut up pyro, song
love this song
oni_link Society
Same.
They can be cruel
Nittany_Discord: Should I start the sequel to Nittany Discord's first adventure?
im a korean
Murray wins his first slam, and Djokovic stays away from Federer's records. goooood :3 although Djokovic still has a very long way to go
MASF123: its unfortunate but I give everyone a chance, if they mess that up then I stop being nice
I just remember coming out of Season 2 dreading nothing more than the effects the remaining 2 PONY.MOV videos would have on the community here. And then worse stuff started running on the stream.
what is the link to this song plzzz
haha
Heh your just like DJ PON3
I'm back, but only for a short while before I head out again.
Well thats it for me tonight. Got a test tommorrow so goodnight everypony!
link to song plz pm
night Obsidian good luck!
Dunno lowfn. I'm canning acting like a maid for a while for professionalism. May not be relevant.
g'ngiht Obsidian
Unnr: btw i think the match was like 1 minute short of being the longest uso final ever
Obsidian: good luck
Obsidian: NIght! :)
night Obsidiam
And then PARTY.MOV came out, and THAT wasn't really a problem.
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma5vmrVNaA1rywedzo1_400.jpg
Vanacus, I think in Fimfiction his name is Dr. Phd Sparkle or something.
rest well Obsidiam
night Obsidian
8^3
because iam french music right there
twilight_sprinkle: Not suprising there, they were playing hard at the end
I hear Buddy Holly
MASF123 that's fine :)
XD
link to sonfg any one name of it?
i noticed it tf2 only lags when more ppl are on
I'm just drinkin expresso like nothin's happening
superretroworld . . . yeah . . .
Unnr: yeah and with baseline grinding it was. tbh it wasnt a good match until the last set, but the last set with atmosphere was amazing
wub wub wub wub wub
Nittany_Discord: All work and no maids makes Nttany a dull mod.
Lol I made a song in famitracker because of a 2 second sound from a pony YTP :D
twilight_sprinkle: So. Much. Baseline.
/me slaps lowfn
They really need to fix that lag issue.
lol
It makes Nittany an unemployed mod.
Canadian_Brony: were you already in a mtach when i tried to invite you?
IMO, I found nothing really humorous in PARTY.MOV, most of it was disgusting to me. However, if you like it, more power to you.
/me hides in corner away from Canadian_Brony
lowfn How dare you you refer to a mod as dull!
GNIGHT EVERYPONY, see you tomorrow, for if i stay up too long, the Insomia gnomes will sodomize me
*cough
I should say too many maids makes Nittany an unemployed mod.
Bronysith: Night! :)
what is the names of these songs?
night Bronysith
Things in excess are bad.
Bronysith, I know the feeling. Good night.
Hey guys member the old gamecube console and member the starfox adventure games? i beated that game like a couple times it was pretty easy and kicked ass
Unnr: ikr. 54 shot rallies.... Murray couldve attacked a lot more and saved some juices, but he won anyway so idk. Djokovic was playing badly, he was moving so poorly
name of the song?
Bye Bronysith.
bye bronysith
Moopy: easy is boring
superretroworld idk, I was in one server that died, moved to another server, was invited to another by one of my friends, then my . . . everything died.
seeya bronys-
dammit
ah, Starfox Adventures
Unnr: too bad Federer didnt make it to the finals, i bet he wouldve bageled Novak again... also Roddick retired after this tournament :<
Canadian_Brony: Bye! :)
what a strange game
well i had to play it it was fun an all
Roddick retired? Noooo
lol I'm almost finished my first full tune :P
AJIsAwesome I was trying to say goodbye to Bronysith
Starfox Adventures: The unholy abomination of the Star Fox franchise.
but I was too slow
again
Hmp
That was the first Gamecube game I played.
Canadian_Brony: still having connection problems?
Unnr: yeah, he was such a fun guy...
Weird ass dinosaurs and shit
AjIsAwesome that fanfic?
Bronies versus Haters. FIGHT!
We already won
Buytoast: tf2 is also a gamecube game?
i had 2 starfox games like starfox adventures and starfox assault
no
And the red team of Bronies PREVAIL!
what?
i was talking about Starfox Adventures
twilight_sprinkle: Tennis geeking in #bronystate. Taking being nerdy to a new level.
oh
superretroworld nah, that's another computer entirely. I'm borrowing a friend's which actually plays TF2, but then I think my dad started pissing with the switchbox.
One fandom leaks into another.
and when my father tampers with electricity, well . . .
Then you have tennis ponies.
I'm okay with them trying to change up the gameplsy style, but all they really did was copy paste LoZ's gameplay style and add crappy voice actors.
Unnr: its a chat dedicated to a show about cartoon ponies, i dont think we can beat that :P
I had Starfox 64 and Adventures...
i had the starfox poster that was hanging on my wall
Any Borderlands fans here? :)
somebody isn't going to be happy. Usually him
oh
Nittany_Discord: Ponies of Tennis: The Musical?
Yikes.
The Crystal Empire, Part 1 cannot wait.
There was actually a tennis pony in mlp, i wonder who he was modeled after
Anyone remember the Nintendo Power video... Y'know, with the Mario doll...
I actually got Assualt and Adventures mixed up, unfortunately. :|
twilight_sprinkle: That sounds like a challenge...
cachi01|muffin, Wave Race
then i statred playing zoo cube
Wave race yeah :)
And espectialy: "THIS. is the Rumble Pak".
Unnr: heh :P
the very first video game I played was either Super Mario World or Super Mario Kart.
Wave Race is a fun game, even though I could never win it. :D
The Crystal Empire, Part 1
AjIsAwesome IKR
My brain melted upon the golden sounds of the Rumble Pak...
twilight_sprinkle: he just wandered off to bed.
This music reminds me of Super Paper Mario, but I'm not entirely sure why
ah k
Wow, it's been so long, I can't remember the first video game I ever played. Maybe it was the orginal Super Mario Bros 1
First game I beat... Contra 2
A first for any systems.
That was *hard*
ah yes, I love Contra
first game I beat . . . umm . . .
driving around in thosr tanks
Contra 2? Nice
shooting brain aliens teamed up with general morgan
first game i played was MOH
cachi01|muffin: with stock 3 lives
holy god parents know NOTHING about technology...
First game i beat was Luigis mansion lol i love that game
I guess you can't really "beat" Mario Kart: Double Dash, but I did get %100.
Unnr o_o
i miss my old gamecube console i should've brought it down to Willmingtion and played it
cachi01|muffin: I still get the theme for that game stuck in my head.
O___O
Double Dash
c:
why didn't I get it before?
The first game I beated...um, I don't know...I guess in my early childhood was um...Mickey and The Magical Mirror game...y'know, with that ghost...and finding the mirror pieces?
Unnr the theme of luigis mansion gave me.nightmares xd
Yeah, that game...
Mario Kart just got %20 cooler
Mario kart double dash <3
best selling Gamecube game of all time
Dash >(\
IKR?
I just made the connection
Lets see, first game I can remember playing was IT came from the desert.
I prefer Double Dash over 64, IMO. :$
On my dad's lap on the Amiga 2600
i have played every mario kart except super and 64 :(
Well 64 only in an emulator
Hello once again bronystate!
cachi01|muffin: You're not really missing out.
I liked the DS mariokart best.
HoodyNinja: Hi! :)
Hi HoodyNinja :)
I have Mario Kart 64, and DS.
I have yet to play 64, GBA, and DS
I dont know why i keep leaving this place
cachi01|muffin: SNES is HARD, and 64 is slippery.
hi HoodyNinja
08,01nighnall!
HoodyNinja because we are awesome
ello hoodyninja
Canadian_Brony: So, thats why i leave?
wut?
LEAVE?!?
no, not leave!
I can't wait for Mario Kart U. It's obvious Nintendo will make it since the Mario Kart games are on every systems.
I remember when.i got my mario kart wii. They gave me a sweetass mario kart hat :)
Canadian_Brony: This is the 3rd time ive been on today
Expect the NES due to graphic limitations.
HoodyNinja I thought you said why you keep comin back
:D
Canadian_Brony: Thats no mystery, i want to know why i keep leaving
ah
I LOVE MK DS and the arcade one. I played it in Japan for the first time ever and I loved it. :D
idk
mmm das a might nice flare gun
i never was any good at tf2
*mighty
I have a Strange Force-a-Nature
I have yet to use it
superretroworld: It is, I just played it in Japan first.
it sucks :P
AJIsAwesome: that was the namco one right?
Oh yeah, the arcade Mario Kart games...It has Pac-Man in those games, which, speaking of, might give Pac-Man a chance to appear in the next Smash Bros.
oni_link: I think so
has anybody hear heard about the creepy luna game?
AJIsAwesome: Ive played them too , those things are awesome :)
VenHur: That would suck
superretroworld no, and I dont' want to know
I wanna play the F-Zero cabinets :(
Well, I heard Namco Bandai is working on the project, so...yeah.
I wanna play a 64 game on a 64
SuperBrony64:
one of the only Nintendo systems I have never played on
n64 was awesome
^
and I <3 Nintendo
VenHur: Its always Nintendo firsthand though :o And Masahiro Sakurai
not as good as the super ninendo. the super nintendo was a god
I went from SNES straight to Gamecube
*gaasp* You don't own a N64?! The granddaddy of ALL nostalgic games?!
nnope :(
N64 was the last Nintendo console I owned.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LXaHJ1po1V8OgcfJZsoMfAO1vLoB4w-wUY1kNIsa7n4/edit
...I feel SO sorry for you.
my gamecube console color was purple
Here's the fic I mentioned before, please comment to help me make corrections :)
^
Honestly, I associate more with the NES and SNES even though the N64 was really "my generation"
And granddad? What nostalgic games?
Nittany_Discord: so after 10-15 years you never bought another one?
N64 = Our childhood of the 90s.
Nope.
Went to the playstation and Xbox.
you tell me Nostalgic Games, I immediately think of Super Mario World
c:
gah
the snes was superior.
c:
took one look and never looked back
Nittany_Discord: Mario party, oot and mm, super mario 64, clay fighter, need i go on?
M:
N64 is best console
Don't forget Donkey Kong Country 1, 2, AND 3. Shit's awesome.
Nittany_Discord: oh nintendo consoles, i thought you meant all consoles :D
its a duck :P
I had Donkey Kong 64. Thank you very much.
I mean, over sooo many games are said to be the greatest the industry has to offer.
As of now, there are wayyy more NES games I remember playing and keep playing whereas my N64 is just collecting dust.
Does anypony have a PSP?
i have a vita
Mario Party REALLY went downhill after 3, but 9 gave me hope in the series.
I have a DSi
nostalgic games for me - Bucky O'Hare, Primal Rage, TMNT arcade
I miss it when games were actually LONG
^
AjIsAwesome.AFTER 4
Don't know why's DKC 3 is the least acclaimed of the bunch...It's kind of underlooked...
I miss it when they were challenging
cachi01|muffin: True.
My future with consoles is uncertain. It's wait and see for me.
Cypresswolf: Bucky O'Hare and the Toad Wars for the win
I've got a wii, nes, n64, playstation, DS, and PC.... Yeah, I've got a collection
Now I can literally just sit there and beat a game in about...an hour or so
Canadian_Brony: I never saw the point in the DSi. :D
earthbound was very underrated
Well on my PSP i have this game called "Pinball Hall of fame" and im a pinball wizard
Canadian_Brony: It wasn't interesting to me.
superretroworld: very. you should mean VERY VERY VERY
13not sure if anypony still watching
The only console company I still happily go back to time after time is Nintendo
Shizuka: I still am.
Shizuka: Look at the chat!
Shizuka of course I'm still watching
Freefall29: eeyup
I am :p
I'm watching. Won't be for long.
HoodyNinja -_(\
Everypony watching!
and did somebody mention Earthbound?
Oh, and I also LOVED DKC Returns.
I'm watching, kinda
I'm back
and I am
final fantasy 6 vs 7.
Canadian_Brony: ;)
Unnr: You are among the extremely few people I've talked to that know what Bucky O'Hare was /)
hard choice there
We are Shizuka but we are talking memorable consoles :P
VenHur: SAME HERE. That game was FANTASTIC.
Freefall29: 6, no questions asked
I've beaten that game 3 times, one alone, 2 times with friends
Freefall29 I choose Super Mario Sunshine >.>
Cypresswolf: (\
When I heard the news Retro Studios is working on that game, my jaw dropped like there's no tomorrow.
/me still occasionally sings the Bucky O'Hare themesong in the shower
7 was awesome, but 6 is... damn. I gotta say 6.
Phase4: SuperBrony64 is a cow
Anyone here remember the Ninja Gaiden series on NES? THOSE GAMES WERE HARD'
>Ninja Gaiden on NES
bbl, need to eat supper
...That wasnt hard.
VenHur: Plus, I was sick of the Kremlings being the villains, anyways.
NES games were hard in general.
That was brutal.
Never beat an NES game.
Unnr: Do you remember what their ship was called? :)
Im making an extra large rainbow dash :) going to take about 9 hours to print.
Mind-raping brutal.
Which Cure is the original o__o;
oni_link: I own ninja gaiden 1. I still remember cursing. I hate those #$*()_@ birds
I mean, how can they pulled it off from a dark first person shooter, to a more kid friendly platformer?
SpeedyBolt: I still cant beat 2 and 3
/me never beat SMB as a kid. :$
Earliest game I ever beat was Super Mario World, but I nearly 100% that game.
I mastered SNES mario kart
Cypresswolf: The Righteous Indignation, duh
I find it harder than Kid Icarus.
Freefall29: ALways with the birds, I know your pain /)
^_^ YES!
I WAS A GOD!
The one who's staring at the chicks ass, obviously.
And so we played the game...our questions is UNACCEPTIBLE!
SpeedyBolt: I cant beat Kid Icarus D:
HoodyNinja: Funny, I actually suck at that game.
I have right now in my hand MK3, street.fighter II turbo and DK country 3 :)
It's SO hard, oni_link D:
/me misses the Nintendo Cereal.
I can beat the turbo tunnel in battle toads easily
:(
SpeedyBolt: It used to be the only game i had
SpeedyBolt: I love the game but I had to put it down because of that :/
-tells Cure to be cloned- The one getting on the cloning machine is obviously the real one :D
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Funrise Toys Offices - When You See It.... Edition
Hey guys im going to lay down on my bean bag looking and watching the chat and the stream so if anypony needs me of something just ping me or something ok but i'll be here
lol
Freefall29: Im jealous
So I went into my room, and I found a few Genesis cartridges.
But now there's 7.... hmmm
SpeedyBolt: this ought to be good
/me lost all his old games when he moved
I think ninja gaiden really improved my reflexes.... and FPS games like tf2 and doom.
Aero the Acrobat, Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3, Sonic 3D Blast
/me "NIN-TEN-DO! It's two cereals in one, wow!" ...GOD, I WANTED THAT CEREAL!
the "I hate mix" apparently?
Fight_club
/me really wants to see a modern re-make of the Mutant League Sports game series
...I played Sonic 3D Blast WAY too much
/me slaps JRP
F1ght club
SpeedyBolt: Did you ever play Sonic Spinball?
Unnr: Bloodbowl is close to it
O_O I spy a Vinyl Scratch in that EQ pic
Too bad I was borned in the N64 days...
I remember, but it was on a different system
oni_link: I actually liked Sonic SPinball. :$
JRP: Fight Club?
JRP: changing the title still counts as breaking rules 1 and 2
I could NEVER beat Spinball.
otakon1: Not in the slightest, really. Bloodbowl is warhammer fantasy and turn based.
Holy shit Sumica actually did it
HoodyNinja: Did what?
Unnr: it's still what Mutant League was based off of
AJIsAwesome: I do too but thats another one I never got to beat. As a matter of fact, I never made it out of Toxic Caves :(
AJIsAwesome: Set it up so you get kicked for talking about battle group
oni_link: I couldn't beat the final level. :D
Been a while since I played L4D(2).
I made it to The Machine on my last life.
HoodyNinja: Oh.
4..wait a minute 3 you...dont let me abandon you/um hello
I remember my genesis games. sonic 1 and stuff. I had aladdin and I would always die at the lava escape level
My brother was a Sonic 1 fanatic.
AJIsAwesome: its the bane of my existance next to Contra which is another on my list :/
I personally preferred Sonic 2 and 3, because of the Multiplayer
ps2 was my personal favourite system <3
YOU'RE TOO SLOW!
I was neutral about the Sonic vs Mario war. I loved both of them equally.
COME ON, STEP IT UP!
SpeedyBolt: Those were my favorite also :3
Oh, Mutant League Sports, that was the time when football gives an "F YOU!" to the NFL lisence.
otakon1: But then you get into Mutant League Hocky
AJIsAwesome: me too /)
I mean, football games.
You should see how many you can clone before the game crashes :p
super mario bros 2 ftw. I don't care what you say, its awesome
and I could not bring myself to stop loving Tails.
oni_link: (\
Freefall29: I actually didn't mind that game. It was pretty good, IMO.
But I personally think my favorite systems are the N64 and Dreamcast.
Freefall29: I liked it too, it was a nice change up, it got the same cold shoulder as Zelda II just because they wanted to do something new
As for the game itself...HOLY BLOODY BATMAN CRUNCHIES! I LOVED IT!
Much better than the Japan version. :S
Why is everyone on this sight a gamer?
SpeedyBolt: Classic Tails <3
Classic Tails is best Tails.
SpeedyBolt: /)
(\
the new sonic as a whole is annoying
i wish banjo and kazooie were still here (i dont beleve theyll make another game)
Banjo had a heart attack from all that Piz-
Labyrinth Zone. I liked it.
Let's face it, THEY SUCKED, but then you got some rare goodys.
Freefall29: he has some redeeming qualities, its just that its gotten to story heavy when its always been about stopping Robotnik.
VenHur: i dont remember banjo kazooie having a water level unless you count rusty bucket bay
VenHur: p1+ro*g*h1+1/2*ro*v^2=constant
VenHur: Clankers cavern was so easy for me!
One nightmare that I will NEVER forget
Freefall29: and the acting is horrendous
Rusty Bucket Bay
VenHur: hows that for water levels
HoodyNinja: Games are a common cultural touchstone in the generations that view the site. Its the same thing as earlier generations sitting around talking about movies.
and Jolly Roger's Lagoon.
Super Metroid SuperBrony64
I LOVED Labyrinth Zone's music. Favorite track from Sonic 1.
You don't have to be a gamer to have played and loved a few games
contra ftw
/me misses video game cereal. :(
Sewer Surfin' from TMNT 4 Turtles in Time was a breath of fresh air from...THAT OTHER WATER LEVEL.
Now i feel like playing tf2...
me and my bro, man. those were the days
Water Levels... Honestly all I can add to this is THE WATER TEMPLE in OOT
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Enough said. :(
*cough* *TMNT 1* *cough*
Fuck OoT's Water Temple
AJIsAwesome: oh crap I forgot that, YOU WIN
What about Great Bay Temple?
ocarine of time is overrated. its not as good as link to the past. no where near as close.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Pies. *sigh*
How about that darned lava chase sequence in the Aladdin game?
SpeedyBolt: that thing was a bitch D:
What should I call my new tune?
inb4 spy spam :D
oni_link: IKR?! So much water level changing...
Freefall29: And even that is beaten by Twilight Princess
HoodyNinja: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA- no.
Ecto Cooler flavor...SIGH...
Freefall29: :D
Freefall29: It was my first zelda experience which is why I like it but it is overrated and it ruined LTTP for me :/
I miss TANG........*sigh*
VenHur: Somepony backsolved the Ecto Cooler recipe
I cant bring myself to hate one Zelda game.
Unnr: They did?! :O
SpeedyBolt: and ice platforms ....They had us going up and down and all around like fools and it took FOREVER
this is awesome
Freefall29 no oot was epic
thing about OOT. The dungeon boss is very close. go in, take a left. and you're there. in LTTP, you gotta go up several floors (or down) and bring potions are required. I'm at the water temple atm, and not a single potion was used yet.
oni_link: and they purposely put Gyorg there
JUST TO PISS US ALL OFF
SpeedyBolt: I dont hate LTTP by any means but I feel like if I had played that one first I would be agreeing with you
Dang you caht derps!
*chat
Freefall29: Nobody uses potions
also, that god damn navi keeps telling me the boss weakness. in lttp, half the fun was finding the boss weakness and exploiting it
XD
in oot
People used potions in aLttP?
Unnr: ...GIVE THAT MAN A FUCKING MEDAL! [no, really]
SpeedyBolt: SCREW GYORG
Freefall29: Same for TP
in link to the past. its almost required
OMG
THIS SONG
awww damn SONIC 3D
I've mastered that Sonic game.
/me actually liked Sonic 3D. :$
...When I was, mabye 6.
Have two degrees. Not using any of them at the moment. :/
SpeedyBolt: that game was soo weird to me
I remember that xkcd
It was a bit straightfoward
Guys this are some of my games :) http://t.co/EpuOqf3W
anybody played mother?
Kill robots, get flickies, feed them to rings.
Mother, as in...Ninten and things?
I actually liked Sonic 3D Blast...I don't mind the overhead angle and the gameplay...
Nittany_Discord: I'm pretty sure something will turn up eventually.
nice setup cachi01|muffin
VenHur: Me too.
But yeah, it COULD of been better.
haha no
My mom used to be the best gamer in the family
It will.
otakon thx.i need a bigger tv lol
I'm the best gamer in my family.
I need to change my background - Anypony have an awesome Lyra background?
yeah, but i mean the game play was really floaty to me. I dont hate it but i cant sit and play it for too long
SpeedyBolt: yeah. mother 1... earthbound zero.
...Sigh...If only Sonic Mars/Xtreme was ever released...
cachi01|muffin: it's okay
Bill Nye?
nice remix Shizuka
I can only get beat in Pokemon, by my friend.
Stupid fire alarm........BRB.

"Can We Fix It?" [Robotnik's voice] NO!
Speaking of old shows...
Clifford the Big Red Dog.

Yes
Dat show

cachi01|muffin: okay well technically its a disk add on but same concept :P
;3;
I miss it.
Fucking...CLIFFORD.
I HATED CLIFFORD
Lol
wb :P
>Hated Clifford
Good thing Cure is there to fix it :P
I still love clifford to this day
Clifford hates you too.
So does Emily.
Lol
:D
I loved Mr Rogers :<
Mr. Magic, anypony? :)
I will fight anyone in here about it
Clifford and His Big Giant Red Ass
Cliff Hanger, hanging from a cliiiff...
Mr.Rogers scared me, but I still watched him alot.
Cure is there to fix everything. THANK YOU CURE <3
And that's why he's called Cliff Hanger
And thats why he's called Cliff Hanger, VenHur :3
You Can't Do That On Television? :)
My hands smell like bleach!
God, I loved that skit...
Who did you murder?
IKR^
If clifford was.male..... And he was giant...... Oh god those,people didnt deserved.to watch that
I bet Cliff Hanger prayed for everyday to be his last.
hoodyninja: i <3 that show
HOORAY FOR CURE!!!
Imagine your fate being to hang on a cliff forever.
cachi01|muffin: he was probably spayed/neutered :D
This is some good music Shizu :3
HIP HIP
Really? O_o Nobody....:S Thats a shame no one remembers those shows
PENIS!!!
Buytoast: Epic upper body workout!
XD
shine on
Not when you're just dangling there.
Cliff Hanger, the 24/7 show
I remember watching PBS Kids for WAY too late in my life. My mom kept me sheltered from the non-educational cartoons for a while. But even after the restraints came off, I felt like I was making myself better by sticking to PBS. In it's defense, I loved Square One TV
WIN!
I think I remember ONE episode of Cliff, something's to do with a genie...
What's that graph on the right?
...I don't know, my mind's blank on that show.
I think I was about 12 when I finally stopped watching PBS
I find myself watching Arthur after school sometimes.
MASF123: Something to do with music
oh
MASF123: system info i think

And I said, HEY! [Hey!] What a wonderful time to play.
Gotta go.

Bye bye Nitt ^_^
The gerbil in the nightgown
N64*
She's working corners now.
Did she just up and vanish?
One of my earliest favorite cartoons were Muppet Babies and Garfield & Friends.
cachi01|muffin: I was never good at that game :/
SpeedyBolt: thats horrible :D
To be honest.
Turok was fun. Turok 2 was one of the best FPSs ever made.
Building corners doesnt seem too hard.
lmao oh you :3
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsqmicSmdq1qju6n5o1_500.jpg Those are some tiny boobs
Oh god...Muppet Babies...

WOAH AH AHAHAHAH AAAAAAH AHAH
CrimsonPhoenix watch "Whose Line" jk
HEY EQD

13it begins
Dammit

GODDAMIT
not again!
I thought they were better than that
0,14ha
13poor rei
CrimsonPhoenix: Link?
Reikim, link to what?
I'm posting it
Zora's Domain.
13remember, eqd thought HUB_Netvvork was legitimate
CrimsonPhoenix: Zora's domain. Which version?
http://youtu.be/fZdsd6mfQsI
I think
Reikim so y u read spoilers
Shizuka . . . what
0,14yeah
There may have once been a time when EQD wasn't crappy about this.
I didn't
0,14ha
13there may have
Shizuka: Netvvork?
I'm smart enough not to, thank you very much
13LONG AGO IN A DISTANT LAND
that . . . no. Just, just no.
I'm just disappointed in EQD for doing this.
oh lord
then y u complain ?
Once upon a time they were better than this.
I AKU! THE SHAPESHIFTING MASTER OF DARKNESS!
but yeah EQD is just for fan stuff now
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CgeZg6CgPU&feature=related
UNLEASHED AN UNSPEAKABLE EVIL!
let people who like spoiling things get spoiled
man Darker than Black's Howling theme is awesome :$ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDcHYL_JDj0
13I SETHISTO THE SHAPESHIFTING MASTER OF FAILURE
no use to go there for official announcement
13UNLEASHED AN UNSPEAKABLE RUMOR
They can find it themselves.
LOL
dat Samurai Jack
Woah do we hate Sethisto this much?
BUT! A FOOLISH SAMURAI WITH A MAGIC SWORD STEPPED FORTH TO OPPOSE ME!
EQD used to have a strict no-spoilers policy.
BECOME HOKAGE OF PONYVILLE?
SO MUCH CANTERLOCK
*swish**slash**cut*
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
those spoilers seem legit
AJIsAwesome: dat demospice :D
and FlutterMEDIC that was awesome :D
13I TWORE OPEN A POHTAL IN TIME
Shizuka: BUT! A FOOLISH PONY STEPPED FORTH TO- Haha, as if, nobody dares tell Sethisto to shut up about Trixie.
Shizuka: I saw that description earlier this morning long before it made EqD posted it. It seems the episode description comes from a website for the S3 DVD that gives summaries of the episode
Why? Because there are people that read EQD who don't want spoilers.
BEFORE THE FINAL BLOW WAS STRUCK, I TORE OPEN A PORTAL IN TIME AND FLUNG HIM FAR INTO THE FUTURE WHERE MY EVIL IS LAW!
Now...
then let them skip that post
NOW THE FOOL SEEKS TO RETURN TO THE PAST AND UNDO THE FUTURE THAT IS AKU!!!!!
RSS
Enough with Season 3. I don't care about what it is, where it is, who it is, what song ... DANG IT! Must I see keywords of it already?
Looking at it
All caps an no kick, there is no justice
It's just a morals thing.
lol
Gotta get back, back to the past SAMURAI JACK
You could just as easily say that anyone who doesn't want spoilers in chat can leave chat.
:D Oh man... I dont have any new vidoes clean enough to post here - so have some Black
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31-YOZ_dY0g
Dang Web chat client stop derping! D:
/me pats MASF123 on the back "It's okay, I get kicked often enough that it evens out"
Why is there a no spoilers policy? Because it's not considerate to everyone else.
This deep-thought fanfic is tworing me apart.
flutter_spin, even chat isn't safe
SHUT
DOWN
EVERYTHING
lol, dat madagascar
flutter_spin: Would you like some more? Because I can probably one-up it.
*BlackGryphon - RarityLicous http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtLMNrlzoBU
flutter_spin, I love you
mind you reading a live chat is not like reading something posted on a blog
Reikim: lol. I'm writing one.
...although it's not really a S3 DVD since only one S3 ep is on it, the rest are from S1 and 2
Cypresswolf close, but not quite
soon . . .
Cypresswolf, way to flasly advertise
Concept's the same.
Reikim: and no competition. I just want it to kill... uh the imagination that is
falsly**
if that's a word
I think about as close as its going to get for Rarity
Cypresswolf: wow this is the best one yet :)
It seems the eps on that new DVD are two S3 eps, Sonic Rainboom, It's About Time, and Luna Eclipsed
flutter_spin: Have you read White Box? I recommend it for deep-thought.
Falesly?
CrimsonPhoenix: Falsely.
again with White Box. I don't like reading :P
but applies differently
oni_link, you dolt it's not even THE rarilicious
flutter_spin: Just a bit of reference. If you don't like reading, though, why are you writing?
Guys do research before assuming
seriously
Not really.
Still love the Pinkie Pie version :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=FLR9HsA55ivKKU0EAQmXcQLQ
EQD is a blog who want the views so yeah to me it's quite obvious they will do things like that
it'll make you look less like an idiot
Bullshit.
EQD needs no more views.
ggg
Cypresswolf, IT'S NOT RARILICIOUS
You do watch their view counter, right?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGI4w6nznw8&feature=plcp
Reading is personal. You and the story. Writing is an expression.
Sometimes when I cancel a commant, the sim walks in place for a while

CrimsonPhoenix: http://www.gamesprays.com/images/icons/fine-jeez-3993_preview.jpg
If anything, this is perhaps worse.
Reading outloud is totally acceptable, when someone is willing to listen.
:[ ello
no seriously and I'm talking about everything
not really since 100000000
oni_link FUCKING EGORAPTOR MUCH?
when giving something, look up

Perhaps so, would make sense that she'd was to remain secret
xbox is "Pay alot for or console, pay alot for your games, pay alot for your controller, pay alot for your accessories, pay alot for your internet, and pay even more to go online!"
NUKETIWN ZOMBIES FTW
Best Twilight Sparkle voice IMO is best is the FiW one, however she can't laugh in her voice.

Reikim|GW2: Row Row, row your boat.

Xbox is best console.
Derpy_Hooves zombies is going to be so awesome
PC is best platform
no matter how small or how suspicious
MASF123: yesh but PC is top tier :P
RESEARCH
cachi01|phone: the story is going to be garbage
00,03Xbox and PC are moi tier~
and maybe then you'll look less stupid

Agreed Scoot-Scootaloo

Derpy_Hooves: IMO i dont play COD for the story :D

MASF123: practically, its weird that Shadow run is the only cross platform game though
Hey guys, anyone here know of The Witcher 2?

Only game I want on PS3 is Twisted Metal which wasn't that good either.
I want MGS4

evening everypony
hi NocturnalBlade
TWENTY FIVE FUCKING GODDAMN DIDDY CENTS.
Hi NocturnalBlade
I play almost every console
seriously, that's the listed trade-in price on Amazon for it
I liek almost every console
whats goin on?
otakon: what a scam, they make gamestop look like a charity
$0.25 for a game
NocturnalBlade: G'eve.
NocturnalBlade: Hi! :)
that is only 4 months old
Hi NocturnalBlade
and it's NOT a no name game

ello NocturnalBlade
otakon: Just finda buyer local. It beats trade in I would imagine.
Microsoft is cheap with their 360. You pay hundreds of dollars for everything, pay continuosly for internet, and then you get Red Ring the day after your warranty expires.
/me plays xbox :$
/me plays almost everything
Kinixys: screw that I'll trade it in at Gamestop when I'm fully done with it...should get at least 15 for it
Scoot-Scootaloo you won't believe how many times i've seen somepony ask for the name of that and only got "I dunno" as a reply
Canadian_Brony: maybe in the R1s. and yeah you pay for their online but its 9 buck a month
not that expensive
Hiya oni_link.

About that Fire Hive PMV, I generally take issue with stuff that derails characters in a bad way. Personally, I feel like that PMV fits Queen Chrysalis pretty well.

OtakuTom: what?
It got rejected by the EqD team!

Not including my PC
Mostly just for grammar issues
Aaaand my mom started watching candy candy

00,03The thing about EqD is... it;s not MLG L3G1T
Canadian_Brony: :<
DerpyMuffins: and that's good how? Unless you're being sarcastic
otakon: even the rare micro?
superretroworld: eeyup
I liked the micro
Ponies47 IKR? Stupid spoilers. They should know better
DerpyMuffins: for what?
the only thing I didn't like was the lack of gameboy support
It means that my fanfic was good enough to be considered rejectable by EqD itself
Canadian_Brony: They should know better -_-
cool
The micro was the only game boy I actively avoided getting...I at least wanted all the others...lol
Hey Scoot-Scootaloo. Thanks for completely messing up any chance of me sleeping at all.
I hated the micro
0,14ah, I see Shizuka posted the more powerful version
Shizuka: XD
Micro was bad
0,14though I keep hearing "sixteen hours" as "sexy power" >.>

Should I click that

Seriously what I always wondered is WHY Adam so squishy in the game even with allthe armor upgrades?
paunch
The stream has clearly inhaled some serious crack.
00,02flutter_spin, he's the character from deus ex: human revolution
Yeah, I'm not good with names and I never finished the game
I mean seriously, he's supposed to be some cutting edge cyberidized assassin basically
i believe Phase4 still wants us to go nuy Deus Ex NOW
00,02otakon, its less 'he's squishy' and more 'bullets are really strong'
:<
00,02plus going really fast
buy&
I don't even remember a single name from Bioshock
heart paunch!
Phase4: and yet it takes a whole clip to gun down one guy in heavy armor WE can't get. I mean look at the first boss for God's sake
How much does this go for?
STAYING ALIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE

Miguel
00,02despite all the complaints about the bosses in deus ex (and compared to the rest of the game they suck) they do still exist within a game engine that allows you to do just about anything
I have atleast a dozen Spongebob DVD's lyin' around
00,02so you can defete them real easy with a little planning
INB4: Spongebob episode Pizza Delivery is streamed later on

Yea, I'd love to make a true-to-real-life-physics no friction mode...nothing would ever move ever unless you could push off a sturdy object...lol
This is what'll happens on December 21...nothing but Cars modded in a Gmod-ish fomat and Benny Hill music.
He escaped from his country. FOR THIS?
:D
I think this is more than no friction.
cachi01|phone: Murrica!
:D
hey there everypony
Or for pushing a car, you move fast, but the car wouldn't as much, since the player character weighs so much less.
howve you been Pearly ?
OtakuTom no friction. There wouldn't be any "sturdy objects"
xD
XD

Shizuka: hay u shold look up lindsy sturling
/me Yawns
Ponies47: are u sleepy
Time for sleep :3
Shizuka: yeah its hard to organize. but i dont think 5 years is alot of time, I listen to NSF files made in 03 and earlier :D
Good night everypony :)
night Ponies47
g'night Ponies47

13some of them are closer to 1995 i think
13some skaven stuff
What colour's the moon?
/me hugs Ponies47 nite
Ponies47: Night!
oh wow :O 97, thats retro
luna
*95
Because that's a colour now.
13but by five years ago i mean it's an archive i took of my box as an emergency backup... which was during high school... which was disaster shizu
eeyup
:P
13so they're scattered all over the place down there
Thanks for the stream Shizuka :3
emblems are 2-tone
13thankfully i can still navigate five years old filesystems perfectly
Fair enough. I guess whichever's the better compliment.
so blue with darker blue
ohhh thats good :P lol
13just a matter of remembering where the clusters were
95 . . high school . . . great, now I feel like I'm the youngest one here
/me Goes to bed
1395 wasn't high school for me no, 2007 was
oh
I noticed when I saw your folder system :)
13but i have some ancient tracker files in here
old is goofd ^.^
*good

oni_link: you dun goofd
good evening everyone
hi OneTrickPony
hoi OneTrickPony
hi OneTrickPony
neat
OneTrickPony: Hi!
twilight_sprinkle: you would say that :P
hiya OneTrickPony
Shizuka: what's a tracker?
13or at least it comes from the cluster of trackers i got from dad, which i knew he'd built up around 97 or 98
Oh, I recognize this music. I believe the game it's used in is called Meritous
13not knowing what they were :3
I should have let that bot die. This is what being a good guy gets you into.
wow, your dad used to collect these?
13way back on aol :3
I am now Left 4 the Dead
Shizuka so if my math is correct, you're in your early twenties. Why do I still feel so young? I feel like I know nothing that existed before Y2K!
1322
I HATE FEELING YOUNG!!!
13i love this ending so much
I wish my dad was into this stuff , Im jealous shizu
13he wasn't so much into it as he had it lying around :3
13so that was the original, this is a remix by someone else some years later
Shizuka: I'm not into pc stuff rmemeber? what is a tracker?
13what you're looking at
Trackers are magic
haha but thats still so cool :P and this ought to be good
13it's midi but better
Shizuka you were born in 1899?

Pfft.

I'm a 1990 child, myself /) Shizu :3
December 13th 1992.
January, anyone?
13when it comes to irc i usually put everyone at 20 and go up or down by their behavior
/me is at 2
13though when i started irc at 17 i was mistaken for like 26 >>
so what did you think I was at first shizu? :)
......
...............
.
13see but if someone asks i'll just say 20 or around there :3
I am the youngest person here right now >_>
/me was probably a 15 on the scale. XD
Why would you want to know what shizu actually thinks of you.
What is this, "guess my age" time? XD
13oh hey! the timestamps are still valid on these
-_(\
I want to know more about the past because I wasn't there. It was relatively recent but so far away.
am i the oldest here?
13the original ice frontier got touched but next is one from 1992
Meanwhile: why not?
otakon is the oldest here
NocturnalBlade: How old are you?
oni_link: Because she probably hates you.
twilight_sprinkle: currently
AJIsAwesome: 23...soon to be 24 in november
but there is another...
Not quite, NocturnalBlade.
Okay. 18 over here.
/me speaks of Kencolt, the grand-elder of Bronystate.
13timestamped october 6 1992
otakon: cypresswolf?
no
Kencolt
i must resist to slam my face in my kybord
13rocking the retro 4 channels
Meanwhile: lol well Id rather know than someone putting up a facade
kencolt is like, 50.
Shit, really? :D
Shizuka, that's really close to how old I am
how are you then otakon
13and of course being a tracker, this 4:15 song weighs 140kb
NocturnalBlade: 28
I wasn't really a good newcomer to bronystate. I didn't know how this place worked and what it was like here, so I learned based off experience.
13an equivalent MP3 usually starts at 4MB depending on compression
I used to feel lucky I grew up as a 21st century kid. Now, I'm looking stories my mother and grandmother would tell of how she grew up.
oh well then i think i'm in third lol
Shizuka: are u mad at me
Yeah, I made a WAV of an NES sound file and it came out to about 16MB
Shizuka: wait, this is more detailed then some songs nowadays, good sounding and it's ONLY 140kb?
13yup
13demoscene does some crazy stuff
haha otakon has been mind blown :D
It's weird, even though I'm 22, that I feel like I'm on the older end of the crowd :S
13also otakon
Over time, I adapted to this place, and I love coming here for both the streams and the crazy conversations we have.
13there are only four notes playing at a time
yes Shizuka?
Shizuka: damn really?
13you can see them :3
13only the black line is playing
AJIsAwesome: same...and another reason ^_^
this intricate at only four notes?
All that looks like is gibberish.
GODDAMMIT WHY DOES MUSIC SUCK NOW?
SERIOUSLY THIS MAKES NO SENSE
otakon: IKR?
I come here for my daily dose of Insanity
Because you're becoming an old man otakon.
otakon, because
otakon: Because we ran out of good music?
lol
4 channels :)
otakon: pffff bieber makes the best music. hes so much better than beatles
I like Petrified_Discord's response
otakon: becaus stupid people
I"m getting emotional, which means I've stayed up too late
twilight_sprinkle: GET.OUT.
Meanwhile, which faction did you go with?
twilight_sprinkle: NOW.
Vigil.
I just met you repeats the same melody over and over again, and it's a hit on radio stations.
cool
*"I just met you"*
AJIsAwesome: okay but that's a bubblegum fluff song
Because frankly smashing things is the only proper answer.
also, calling it right now, the identity of the Master of Whispers
otakon: http://images.wikia.com/central/images/3/38/Okay_face.jpg
AJIsAwesome: they're only meant to be catchy and light and bubbly.
is the Charr you meet as your first contact
13i forgot how well i balanced the eq in this player
twilight_sprinkle: lol i just got snaped at for saying metal is betre than mario muisc
G'night everypony. I'm hitting the hay so I can drown in a sespool of horomones and emotions.
13the bass is wubful <3
The Master of What.
and he's selling apples
twilight_sprinkle: okay okay, you don'thave to go.
nite Canadian_Brony
its all aboot them biebers and rebecca black >_>
head guy of the Order of Whispers
Thank you Shizuka for everything really.
nigte Canadian_Brony
Isn't that "Call Me Maybe", AJIsAwesome?
otakon: yay
Canadian_Brony: that sucks... take care.
I would still like some differentiation every once in a while, though.
night Canadian_Brony
Polydunami|PS: eeyup
Ah, don't think you interact with the other orders heads.
Canadian_Brony: NIght!
you said this is xmplay correct?
scottish-geeky: lol well tbh i dont know much about either. i prefer classical/orchestral
its not fryday frady somthing somthing
13february 8 1004
13er
131994
you either do at some point, or it'll be in an expansion
1004? That's old
13entitled War in the Middle Earth

/me pukes

/me prefers Cookie Monster's: Share It Maybe
13nine channel s3m
scottish-geeky: French Fry Day, Fry Day, gotta get down on Fry Day?
twilight_sprinkle: ya i like enthing that isnet rap or pop muisc so classica metal and punk
Petrified_Discord: lol
Perhaps I haven't reached that bit yet.
This is very neat.
Im thinking of trying Deflemask tracker out.
scottish-geeky: yeah i cant stand rap. i dont even think it should be classified as music
13(file is timestamped january 1996, so that must have been when dad was collecting)
I prefer Jazz/Classical(Orchestra)/Electronic. There are more but I can't remember them right now.
i can listen to just about anything...but i have my limits lol
Whatever happened to the Modarchive?
Although it seems to be between two defined pitches as far as I can hear it.
I wonder how much of the story quest is left actually, I'm already level capped.
13they're still around i think
twilight_sprinkle: thank you all rap is talking slow or fast and raming once or twice
needs moar Cradle Theme from goldeneye n64
it ties into each of the dungeons, that much I know
scottish-geeky: exactly! all it takes is a beat, which is like 1% if the full requirement it takes to make actualy music
These songs need to have more exposure.
I only looked after asking. I see, they are still around.
13bass getting through okay? this is more awesome than i remember it :3
Yep.
It's alright.
Shizuka: yeah
My tastes are kinda weird...here's an example: in my playlist "The Stampede" from the Lion King ost is followed by "The Super Mario Super Show Intro in German". I don't even speak German. XD
twilight_sprinkle: and thay say insutls that a 1ft grader make and say ther "hardcor" -_(\
this Charr is so funny
Petrified_Discord, I have Scottish Pirate metal followed by music from the Pokemon Red
Going to have to take my thief into Whispers and get a look at that.
scottish-geeky: my friend actually told me once that "im sexy and i know it" has deep philosophical meaning :I
GabeMoist: scottish pirit metal SEND TO ME
GabeMoist: Combine them: Scottish Pirate Pokemon music :O
Shizuka: this is some good damn stuff
twilight_sprinkle: You're joking, right?
AJIsAwesome: i wish i were.
twilight_sprinkle: pffft HAHAHAHAAHAHAAH :D
wow this is awesome
As well as Beethoven followed by Katamari
twilight_sprinkle: Wow........*sigh*
scottish-geeky: ikr :P
That just screams hippy to the nth degree to me, twilight_sprinkle :D
The bass is coming through wonderfully
13have to do my all time favorite next even though it's a slower paced song
yeah, he said "im sexy and i know it" is as good as classical/orchestral
please do
Petrified_Discord: i got weird tastes too...i like alot of brony music but i still listen to my Psychopathic Records CDs i have ^_^
twilight_sprinkle: thers one pop sonf i like nad its GUNGAM STYLE and that only becuas it has asias sillnes
twilight_sprinkle: Wow. Just wow.
13may 1997
twilight_sprinkle, what about "I'm sexy and I know it" done in an orchestral style?
NocturnalBlade: O_O
Well, this was nice but I need some sleep. Night everyone, thanks for streaming Shizu.
13i love this song to death and back
woot first piece of my large rainbow dash is done... 3 hours and 40 minutes later http://i.imgur.com/CtIke.jpg theres a normal sized dash next to it for scale reference.

Meanwhile: Nite!
6Morning x)

Petrified_Discord: yea...told ya i was weird
scottish-geeky: i hate gangnam style with a passion, because its so popular. its become a hit, and itll just encourage more music of the same
GabeMoist: ew
Night Meanwhile
NocturnalBlade: /)
/me turns up his volume and closes his eyes
Oh...my <3
I thought about doing a Bronystate parody of IS&IKI, about the lag. I only did the chorus.
Petrified_Discord: (\
How soothing
A WILD C7 APPEARS
13this song is probably why i didn't have a full mental breakdown at any point during high school
morning :P
6xDDD
6How you doing? ^^
Case in point, twilight_sprinkle; the guy who did gangnam style is appearing on Ellen tomorrow. With Britney Spears.
scottish-geeky: i can understand that its silly, but its still pop, and its popularity will jsut encourage more of the same
twilight_sprinkle: that i agre but i love enthing that comed frome asian land
awesome, you?
its so soothing and upbeat :3
Kandarihu: You would only have to write the first 12 seconds, then replace the rest with spinning dots
6Pretty good,thx ^^
scottish-geeky: i love stuff from Japan, not all asian countries are cool :P
But that would just be first verse.
Polydunami|PS: /)_-

scottish-geeky: well technically beatles is pop too. its just more complicated pop than anything modern
6:3

The first Lindsey Stirling song I saw was the shadow one. Fukken brilliant
scottish-geeky: mebbeh ill check her out some time, i was originally just looking for violin concertos before i bumped onto the whole violin dubstep pukefest :P
6Something random..I had gone to some concert with some friends and somehow,at some point,I quite easily managed to get quit close to the front..they had left a big opening as well..there was this girl who turned out to be retarded (some guy had made this sign and was showing it to the crowd with sort of apologetic face or something)..then she started singing.
o.o
hi
13i think you all might recognize this next, assuming i'm picking the right one
twilight_sprinkle: Look up her shadow song. It's my personal fave
O.O
twilight_sprinkle: thers only one part of it is dubstep the rest is viloine

Well, we know where OneTrickPony lives now O_O
o hai Panda
how are you man?
OneTrickPony :D omg hiya
oni_link: .... cursis folied agen
You know what? It's good to get back to the basics of what music is all about. It's not about the lyrics, although lyrics are an important, yet optional component of a song. It's certainly not about the artist, and it's not about the debauchery that artists may be pressured into for one stupid reason or another.
/me silently sneaks up behind Panda and NOMZ
/me hugs Panda
13the theme is pretty much built from C-F-G arpeggios
O_______O
twilight_sprinkle SPRINKLE!
Panda: haaai :3
Polydunami|PS: uh oh O____O
It's about the form and the feeling that it invokes in the listener.
and OneTrickPony, if you can do two tricks, Ill give you something for free :3
It's okay, OneTrickPony; I live in Vancouver :)
Yeah.
Kandarihu: or thought and emotion
One trick...two tricks: Panda done!
nope
cant see it
/me attacks Panda and twilight_sprinkle with hugs

/me slaps scottish-geeky around a bit with a large trout
whoops O_______o
Panda: see...1,2
Panda: no trout my one weeknees
btw scottish-geeky have you heard, today scottsman Andy Murray won the US Open, ending Britains 78 yr of grand slam champs
OneTrickPony looks the same to me >.>
OneTrickPony, how the heck did that happen? Lots of upload, but no download?
scottish-geeky: 78 yr drought*
Kandarihu: lol IDK it's comcast being weird
twilight_sprinkle STOP TORRENTING! You're LAGGING!
:3
=D
Panda: I can count to 2 therefore 2 tricks
Panda: shhhhh dont tell anybody D:
twilight_sprinkle: HUZA =D
13when i see a solid line of red notes in this player, i know awesome phrases are being built
scottish-geeky: yep, twas quite a victory!
13(black meaning the instrument plays from start, red meaning it switches notes without restarting the sample)
^^ I wont tell anyone twilight_sprinkle about your obsessive illegal downloading of free music :3
If you're on a residential line, that should be physically impossible.Coaxial cable was only meant to send large amounts of data one way, and not the other.
what is a good repository for these IT/MOD files?
13modarchive is still around i hope
13that's where i built up in high school
It is still around
13this is taken directly from the bejeweled 2 files
Panda: fine, ill come clean! heres all the stuff ive torrented! http://i.imgur.com/lyAKY.gif
/me yawns

OneTrickPony, who is your fav pony?
What kind of program is it to take up 635TB anyway?
Polydunami|PS: its not a program, its a real car!
Panda: idk applejack, rainbow dash, carrot top
OneTrickPony carrot top... hm...
What, does it magically vapourise in your living room when the download is complete?
Polydunami|PS: all you need is a converter and a matter transmogrifier, they sell those at every local walmart
lmao
And then you have to install it into your driveway afterward?
Panda: how bout you?
OneTrickPony lady Rarity of course.
Polydunami|PS: yeah
lol okay
but thats not what I was asking for XD
So 3D Printing a car?
this has so much atmosphere
Kandarihu: with a functioning engine and everything
13makes me sleepy near the middle but it's perfect for matching jewels :3
twilight_sprinkle.... nvm
Well, I'd be surprised if such a technology is invented while I'm still alive.
Panda: hm? did you ask me something?
nope
:#
Shizuka: i almost forgot that this was from bejeweled
:3
o u
Panda: lol wat
OneTrickPony XD what?
dat awkwardness
Panda: nvm
<_<
/me facepalms
Man, that would be an interesting thing to do. Not sure if all the models would REALLY amount to 635TB, though.
13part of the fun of trackers is working out which channels are doing what, especially when they switch midway
Yeah, that IS fun
Or panning :3
13then you get the oddballs where the lead's waaaaay off to the right and who knows where the percussion is coming from
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
>takes Chinese >ded

yea
blame microsoft for not having DLC for the orange box
00,02microsoft doesnt want free dlc
00,02its bizare
Well i could blame them for a little bit but not to much
00,02they are actively blocking valve
Free and DLC in the same sentence for Microsoft is blasphemy

Phase4, so much want.
So is everyone just talking about TF2? Honestly I ahve never plays MVM because it takes ages to find a seerver.
So much lols.
Also, having no taunt might be a good thing because I tend to press G when reaching for H sometimes.
bye guys
So, Pan > Fists might be fact.
Cya, alexxm. Take care.

Rarity is annoying as hell though

00,02loldeadringer
Fluttershy needs to be nerfed a tad, mostly her ultimate.
Wait, how many players on the server?
there must be around 5 to have that kind of health limt on hero
hi again. no planetside?
00,02DashWithRainbows, y u no on red with us

But I can do other things as well
Pearly: That's really cool. I wish I was good enough to make a living with my art.

One thing I loved about the Canterbury Tales was Chaucer's self-inserts. XD

Heh, silly question I guess. At least it's not a series then.

Gold_Demona: what's it about?
I can't have my speakers maxed cuz then if I get pinged my ears will explode. :P

Oh jesus. Caught me daydreaming MadSurge
The ding scared the shit out of me
:D awesome!
Pony!
hi everyone :)
Heya Lil_B
OWNED
hey lil b
good day all
LIKE A BOSS
Hello Lil_B and Alchemist!
/me thanks Barbetos|AtWork Moopy and MadSurge :)
and hi Alchemist :)
your welcome dude
hmm, this movie looks familiar. Wasnt this on a recent movie night?
hi Lil_B!
I got my new WLan Stick today, I can watch the Stream again :D
This reminds me that War of the Roses is a game that's being made.
Alchemist: I don't think this has ever been shown on a movie night
Which is kind of surprising to me to be honest.
Barbetos|AtWork: I definitely seen this being streamed here though.
I think war of the roses is done
Lots of freezes though. Or is that just me?
Vivix: last I heard it was still in beta.
oh yea, second october
I was excited until I heard it was third person-
what?
Vivix: I thought you could play it first person too.
3rd person is just better for aiming.
well, I hope so- but the videos I've seen of it so far all state "third person game" -
I know you can close your helmet, but then it actually darkens your screen as well.
steam article too say third person game- so I don't think FPS is available, but if it is
they seem to have tried to make it very accurate that way
let me check.
What is this game you are talking about?
War of the roses
War of the Roses, you can find footage on youtube
Never heard of it.
INSERT MEDIEVAL GUILE'S THEME HERE
think quake arena with knights
That's because the game's not out yet.
as far as I understood it's TDM and DM only? /long since seen anything abou the game
gah, jittering
I'm going to miss it.
Heck, just regular Guile's Theme would do. It goes with everything. :P
TASTE THE SPEAR MUTHAFUCKA
Call of duty, medieval England?
pretty much
it's very violent.
They're rubbing him in his face
TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO
You're not whacking a a sword against a healthbar there, you're stabbing people in the face.
yes, the only thing that dissapoitned me, is the third person
but--yeah
I got a bit tired of fps type games for now. Im waiting for the Xcom remake.
screw yo armour!
LIKE A SIR
I mean it's like, Alan Wake was fun, but I hated playing it because the guy was always in the way on my screen
^So you don't like 3rd person in general?
I just got here and what am I tripping on?
Shit there we go
SirGanjalf, pretty much- I can enjoy it if it's..centered, but in alan wake it was over the shoulder, so he was ALWAYS in the way-
That was awesome that was great
Good movie........
and of course top down, like baldurs gate or fallout is just great, I love that third person style
I'm going to have to go. The stream is too bad for me to follow more of this.
Vivix: same here, but tps like in GTA doesnt bother me. I think the camera type like in Alan wake is referred to as "over the shoulder" view rather than third person
NAY, Great one
Oh and it ends. Nice timing.
I am out, good night everypony
Alchemist, true true, in GTA and S3 and whatnot- it feels right. I think it's over the shoulder that bugs me the most
/me Insert WE WERE ANGELS (2nd DBZ Ending)
night Rommulus
in War of the roses I only wish it weren't third person at all because they wanted to make everything so period correct and almost realistic-
End a medieval movie with AC/DC. BRILLIANT!
Now that the movie is done, can I link a video?
Vivix: Well i like that in AW you can atleast choose on which side of the screen you character should be.
not yet
So, I cant get on youtube at school, but I can get on facebook? LOGIC!
SirGanjalf, reaally? I must do that- change him to the other side
Moopy: was that to me?
yes
Vivix: I think it's TAB key in PC version.
Anyway, I got a link to WotR. The game stays in third person yet, but it covers your screen as if you're wearing a helmet in first person.
Aah- thanks! Cause when I wanted to read a sign or look at something, I'd always have ot kinda..stand next to it and twist and turn-
Tab will- help
So bored
Quote from the game: "Control wise, the primary focus is getting third person to work perfectly, but if we find the time and succeed in getting the controls just right, who knows... It might require a whole different control set to be at all playable in normal hand to hand combat. The thing is also that a standard first person view raises a number of other issues that has to be resolved as well. We plan to put the camera wherever it is most
but yeah, I'm just a first person fan in all immersion games, I feel third person makes me relate less to the character. Sometimes that's a good thing, as if you're reading about the character, not being him or her, but- often I feel FPS works better in adventure and puzzles
Vivix: Np. Also some signs can be read by pressin "f" or "e"(Huh, i don't remeber, though i've finished it last weekend:P)
Ooh
Let's hope Wrek is awake :D
Whoa, that looked a lot shorter when I copied it.
Nord Mead!
05hope you liked
05i still got a headache so ima gona keep lying down
Ok now you can send video links now
Wrek: awww
Take an aspirin then
Wrek's not feeling well? :<
Here you go http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu2-EFYXEX0 I hope you feel better soon Wrek
Wrek sounds bed -.-
Damn you school!
Get well wrek
If you forward to 12:22 you get (one of) the helmet view.
Wrek needs his wrest
I guess Wrek is wrek'd.
BA DUM TSS
/me groan
http://derpy.me/p9ovd
Thank you, try the veal.
Alchemist: :D wut?
Oh yeah, and the executions are in first person...If you're the one being killed.
Closing the helmet actually gives you a defence bonus against being hit in the head.
Real life is in first person
HoodyNinja: nothing, just Vinyl bugging the hell outta octavia. Thought it was kinda cute.
i know how you feel wrek i felt the same way as you so get some rest for a while then about few weeks you will feel alot better dude
Its extremely cute!
Confound you bronystate, you drive me to insomnia
and that's a bad thing?
Dunno if true, but I heard that if you a blade or arrow in the viewslot of a helmet, you can instakill people.
Ohai MirrorImage
I know for a fact that a lance to the face is an instant kill.
Nyst - that's cause a lance to the face tends to go all the way through the head
I hope Therainbowvortex is doing alright guys
Oh yeah, there's an exectution at 15:18
...ok, what are you talk about Nyst?

Ah the timer keeps on ticking :3
Apparently Xen is not in this release, but the next one or.something
I hope it's not six years until next release
Playdough!
the greatest of all toys
I beg to differ. Lego is where it's at.
Hey who likes Duke Nukem in here? and who doesn't like it?
Kinda enjoyed the original 3d, never bothered with the other
played some of the original, but not a big platformer fan
Good afternoon people :)
Vivix: I am and I played the first trilogy :D
original was good, 3d was better, latest one was meh.
http://youtu.be/z5rRZdiu1UE does this count as rap? If so, I like this rap
MadSurge, hehe, liked it? A friend of mine had it, and I watched her play it- didn't really capture me at the time. I was more into doom then
hi MLP_Brovakiin and Vivix :)
Hiya Lil_B
Hello Lil_B :)
wanted to watch the Rap, casn't because of GEMA grrr
aww
brb
It's beastie boys, sabotage
Vivix: I liked Doom too, but I grew up in arcades, and I love platformers
