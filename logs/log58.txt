Martha = worst companion.
It was 105 here today
But
Link: im jealous
I don't hate Amy as much as a lot of people do; she's brilliant at times (when the doctor's not around) and she was my first companion, you know?
0thats when i got it
The humidity
Was killer
*ROse
I meant Rose
0Martha is AWESOME
FUCK HUMIDITY.
lol
0ah good
Yeah

This is why I like winter better
Silly Dman, that's not how you spell LAME.

^
oh you guys
0its her fault cus shes
MUMMY
Donna Noble is best. <3
AAAAAAAAAND GIGGLE AT THE GHOSTIES.

Those -10F wind chills feel good
No, Ace is the best.
0wat dee_twenty martha is amazing i loved her as a companion
I have work :(
HAH OLD WHO
0lol
My car has black leather too
hopefully you work indoors
Haha, old-school companions

...what.
Every word out of Martha's mouth pissed me off.
I will roast
i'm used to the burn though :P
Hey
Before I get there
Lol
!chimersa
:3
:(
y jack just go pop
but yeah, i work indoors
with no AC
pet
oh snap
I liked how Martha wasn't ever really "shipped" in the show with him
My steering wheel was on fire today I swear
i wasnt looking
Also I somewhat like MAD now :o
The place I work has Ac
:3
Dammit, not Martha
MAD?
The show
'NO YOUR ADOPTED.'
:(
/me purrrs
I meant Donna
TTG: Except for her constant fawning over Martha.
Oh.
Nevermind
0Ace was pretty hot
On Cartoon Network
we have fans everywhere though
0but did sodall
still hot as a bitch
ADOPTED
(warehouse)
Lo
awwww

over the Doctor*
'NO.'
Parody of everything like Robot Chicken, just not only claymation
0dem nanotechs gunna work sum magik
Pokemon Park was awesome xD
This is why this is my absolute favourite episode.
0cmon cmon recognise her dna doo eet
Why can't we ever have a cold summer
oO
And Ace never took any of the Doctor's shit.
Lol, looks like the magic from the Green Mile
0but seriously, 9th seems very dumb compared to brilliant 10th and 11th
Just this once, everybody lives! - Memorable line
We need an ice age :(
come on kid
lol
THIS is why Eccleston is the best Doctor.
Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned Nanomites look like sparkles.
0HAHA EVERYPONY LIVES
Pff.
YES
i'd be ok with that
No not the crappy game
XD
As if Tennant didn't have as good or better episodes.
YES
The short on MAD
EVERYPONY LIIIIVES
So was videogame princess
Exactly, he DIDN'T.
i prefer intense chill over intense heat
He had so many better ones. :P
0EVERYPONY LIIIIIIVES THIS ONCE
Altair: do you like snow?
anyday
The writers really do their research on their stuff xD
0EVERYPONY LIVES
hell yeah :3
South Park + Pokémon?
but we hardly get any here
Zero is a funny definition of many.
You are never going to change my mind, because Tennant is easily best Doctor.
Nope
HAH
0>_< i don't know who i liek moar
Tennant was great
Watch it for yourself it's awesome xD

We either hit or miss

MAGIC. FRIENDSHIP. LIMB REGENERATION.
WHY WON'T GOD HEAL AMPUTEES
I knew a kid named Colin Baker going up weird eh
You are from Va?
yeah
I was really hoping for a black doctor.
you know where amherst is?
^5
where is Trollestia when you need her
Uhh
lynchburg?
Yeah
0i think that ... um .. i don't actually mind that
should be played by Dave Chappelle
There was a black actor in the same program as Smith.
Loved that
amherst is like
Smith was the main character.
right beside lynchburg
Oh
that's where i'm from :P
But the black actor outacted him SO BADLY.
0the london episode with master (old dr who) is crazyawesome
"Who says that, red bicycle when you were twelve?"
You barely noticed Smith was there, he was so poor.
Do you know Dulles airport
In Va
You just assumed he was an extra or something.
I actually liked Paul Mcgann as the Doctor.
8?
Yup.
yeah, i've flown through Dulles
0aww bitchin program don't know bout his tardis
Give me #25
What I've seem of it, he seemed alright
The Master though...Yeah, the less said about him, the better.
0 8 25? what we on about
0aww man callingcthulhu i like the master
I live like 4 miles from it
0HERE. COME. THE DRUMS!
Doc 8, I meant
8th's Master.
Inb4 I'm stalked
Oo;
:p
lol
He was...Flamboyant.
ooh~
Wouldn't 25 be impossible since he only has 13 regenerations and then he dies for real?
Giant pidgey
His maaaster~
0ah that one was funny, i guess, but yea ...
Pidfey knows Fly

0WHYWUBWOO accent <3
Oh
it's 4 degrees hotter avg i think
I can dance!
I love this song.
I was at the outer banks a few weeks back
but we get (at most) 10in per winter
Heh
I hope not, I like the idea of the Doctor passing the mantle to his daughter.
woo obx
It puts me In the Mood
GIANT PIDGEY.
Hey Quil~
Also the references to Digimon.
and Yu-Gi-Oh
So...
lol
Party?

i think that was the record
A PARTY =D </pinkie>
Walking with Blue Eyes White Dragon
Eccelston. Meh.
Average.
0u want linkn to another?
Next time on My Little Pony
0it's awful quiet....
0perhaps a 10th one?
FUCK THOSE SLYTHEEN BASTARDS. FUUUUUUUCK EMMMMMM.
And how they basically mirror the concept of Pokémon
Ecclest. WHOO! God.
Sorry.
iirc
or with the D-Reaper.
But it's very personal.
oo
You could do Blink.
0lol
:V
In 2010
I seriously love how Gyrados just eats Charizard
0you like 10th you pic ; )
well, storm for us = 3in

So freaking funny xD
0maybe i'll pick 11th if we both haven't collapsed by then
GYARADOS EATS EVERYTHING
The whole east coast got snow
0aaaaany episode : P
people here don't know how to drive
YES
Except us
in snow/general
We got 0
Hmm, let me think.
:(
I like this ending theme
Just anything but the one where he makes himself a human, I hated that two parter.
Fucking long-nailed calcium farting bastards. I have no idea what Davies was on when he made em but Great Celestia, man.
Southern Va got like a foot
And you catch that Pokémon Manga reference?
NYC Philly got like 2 feet
Dc got .1 :p
western NC got a ton
"They'll stay cute and cuddly forever!"
Hey, let's watch Torchwood now.
0what is it about them callingcthulhu?
Vampires of Venice?
Nope :(
I think the episode we just watched is Eccelston's best.
I HATE. HATE. the Slytheen.
What is it referring to?
does DC handle snow ok?
If you want CallingCthulhu.
0y
Well to be fair in feb 2010 we got 43 inches of snow in a week
No
The episode we just watched is the best period.
I just said why.
0and torchwood wat ep? that is if u want me to get the link for ya : D
We suck at driving in show
To the Pokémon Fan Club
Snow
They're an incredibly stupid alien race.
Ah.
Meh, not the best full stop. :P
0yea callingcthulhu i guess thats a reason
same here
Streets get plowed tho
our snow crews suck
They're a walking toilet joke, really.
And salted
The one where Jack stops a giant is a good one.
Ours are decent
0welp, lemme know what u want and i'll find it
they take days to get out
Except on feb 2010
Miracle Day?
while all the idiots with SUVs think they can speed
lol
Haven't watched that one yet.
They piled snow on my neighborhood entrance
Blink is really good but it sets a bad precident with Moffat's wibbly time plotholes
There's only 2 our for Miracle Day.
wtf
:(
From the main road
out*
We were trapped
Lol
It was insane
2 weeks off school
1 week no roads
damnn
once we had an ice storm
got maybe 3in
I hate ice
we lost power for 7 days
Effect preceeding cause. It makes your head hurt in a good way, but you have a sneaking suspicion it's all bullshit
I don't actually watch Torchwood, since it more or less takes out the fantasticalness of Doctor Who and replaces it with Jack, but it has a few good episodes.
down towards charlotte, people lost power for a month
Didn't they? X3
and we had no school for around a month
0yea torchwood generally sucks / is ok, only a few are good
Well do you want Torchwood, or not?
0i don't mind
nah
some people had to sleep in their school because no one could get out lol
By the way, I'm not wearing any underwear right now.
0nice
...
Thanks.
No, it's not relevant to anything.
:S that dont sound good at all
0ok, um....awkward
For telling us.
I just wanna say.
Yeah.
:3
Lol
It's like he's wearing nooothing at allll
We rarely get ice here
noooothing at alllll
0WOW
noooothing at alllll
0sorry bout that
It's either snow or rain
Stupid, Sexy, Cthulhu.
Hmm
hello blue wall of text
0There
0awkward
We could go for that epiosde that has all the Doctor's current and old accomplices of the new series.
awk-waaard
And all the spin off characters too.
In 1999 we got a big ice storm though
0ummmmmm can't remember that one...?
Yeah.
0well sure
Journey's End?
Donna's last episode as his accomplice.
Uh.
ice sucks
:/
No thanks.
The season 4 finale?
0season and name/ep no.1 please?
Link: wasn't so bad for me
i got a week to play pokemon
0oh callingcthulhu no likei
Lol, what's wrong with it?
Half-Human Doctor gives me Movie flshbacks.
Season 4 finale, Journey's End
And the Master. *Shivers*
That's not an episode with the master?
The master's not there =]
Lol
Also, they need to give the Master back his beard.
0do we want journey's end then?
sure why not
I mean his real beard.
Not the wife.
lol
The beard was pimp.
Dunno, CallingCthulhu seems to think it's bad.
When I was stranded in 2010 I was working on a gba rom hack
I have nothing against it.
rbr in a bit
For like the whole week
Except for Human Doctor.
Grrrrr.
Doctor Donna =D
I'm good with anything as long as we're not watching the one with the Doctor hiding out as a human school teacher. *Wretches*
I thought Donna was good as a second Doctor.
BINARY BINARY BINARY BINARY BINARY BINARY
0season 4 finale has master
0journeys end is season 3?
Last of the Time Lords was so dumb on so many levels.
No, the End of Time special had the master
0no hmm
02*WB03(Drake03)02WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
The End of TIme special wasn't the season 4 finale
0i quite like 11th hour
I think
hey Drake
0soooo was i'm there right now : P
Which one was that?
04Hey ALtair
Brotherhood of Blood or something like that, I think that's the one I can't stand.
0it wasnt FINAl finae
Personally, I think Moffat's run is one of the best of the new series right now.
0but part of the finale episodes
I don't like most 11th Doctor episodes. :S
0aww ;( ok
ohai Drake o3o
0no 11th suggestions then
Eh, I do
0*cries*
so have we come to a concensus
0lol
04Hey SS
0joke
I like the good episodes.
0durr comment is durr
I.E Some Eccelston, mainly Tennant.
0I like the episodes that don't suck
NOTHING AT AL.
Lol dc is still at 90f
Doctor Who fans NEVER come to a consensus. :p
Nothing at Al?
At 2am
0LET'S JUST FUKKEN WATCH BLINK OK GAIS?
this is true of many fandoms
:c
Wut.
Global warming is real
0inb4 'i don't like the episode blink' lol
Why would I stay up at 7:30 am streaming if I hate you guys. :P
Blink is good; let's watch Blink, eh
...Because.
:(
i think he just doesn't like the episodes you guys like or something like that
I HATE BLINK etc.
If Dari hated you all, he'd have found something worse than Spider's Web to torment you with by now.
If we can't decide, we won't be watching ANY episodes.
Dashite: I'm working on it. :P
0callingcthulhu u do?
/me hugs Dman back
Unless the arguing is the fun part.
ALL IN FAVOR OF BLINK, PRESS ENTER

Blink is fine, the newer angel episodes though... They really worked best as a one shot.
it does seem that way
Yeah.

Great way to ruin what was awesome.
0no megavideo so as to avoid cutoff mmmkay?
I think they've got a lot of good moments
The newer angel episodes are probably my most hated out of all. >_>
They completely ruined it by showing the angels move.
And making it all crappy.
Haters gonna hate, etc.
0yea angels ruined
And Matt Smith.
0indeed. that was shitty.
>_>
It doesn't hurt the old angles at all

MFW they never explain how the Doctor gets out of the Pandorica.
0scootaloo plushie on ED : D
Actually, it's scientificlly impossible that it would be 'the same rain'.
It's so poor.
So if I took a hammer and chisel to one of these angels and carved myself a weeping pegasus, would it send me to Equestria?
They explained it
Maybe they'll explain it later.
it was just wibly
No they didn't, he just automagically got out.
http://www.clamtxt.com/?r=28048
He went back to before he got out after he got out to tell them how to get him out
0what is that mib_eirdop?
'They're all pirated.'
Amazing, it's almost as if the writer forgot all about why it was a bad idea for Rose to fuck around with the past in Father's Day.

0IMPOSITION PART 6 GUYS YES! my 3rd fave fanfic!

Except for the whole thing where Rose nearly destroyed the universe by saving her father, that kind of supports the idea that it's supposed to be a linear progression, otherwise it wouldn't have nearly destroyed everything.

I never liked Stargate, at least not the series.
why would his name be blue
SG1 was so awesome.
Stargate is awesome. A friend of mine is making his way through the entire series for the first name.

Ok then Dman.
Let's watch the stream on the stream, lol
I'll see you tomorrow.
INCEPTION.
alright Dman

0lol c ya today
XD
night yo
I could get my mic.
>Only pony who has not seen nor has any desire to see Inception.
0>night. O U
karaoke?
Eh, ot
drop the beat
Also, tommorow is DnD Night.
0Bai Bai
It's pretty good, Dee
Lawl, if you want karaoke.
It'a not as mind-fucky as people say it is
but it's a very good movie
Lordkat's Stream :D
It sounds like a Matrix knockoff.
haha
windowception
not really
It really depends
It kind borrows a few elements, but it's not much simlar
AWESOME
But yeah
My Wing-Wang is acting all funny now.
Opera sucks in some aspects
I wanna drop a penny down the hole
It's not anything like the matrix to be honest.
They add too many features few people need
And it's a pretty good film.
Matrix is better though.
:P
And they don't seem to pay enough attention to things that need to be attended to
It's all weird.
Like colour profiles
uh what movie are we talking about
12I always thought the interface is simple o-o
Eh, Matrix has a lot of nostalgia going for it
My Wing-Wang.
>Disliked the Matrix trilogy. Especially disliked Keanu's pasty white ass.
Matrix really isn't that complicated and the acting isn't fantastic
let's watch Pokemon episode 1 herp derp
Keanu is awesome.
And he's a really nice guy.
In real life.
*ignoring sequels*
HOW'D IT GET BURNED
Sorry.
Yeah, he is
Keanu is sad.
Yeah, saying the Matrix is better doesn't fill me with the urge to watch Inception.
Opera's?
I'm more of a Nic Cage fan.
oh okay we're talking about Inception
12Yeah
doi
He may be a nice guy, but it doesn't improve his acting.
Nic Cage is AWESOME when he plays screwed up characters.
So, it's probably better than the Matrix, if you don't think the matrix is perfect
VAMPIRES KISS
YES
I'M A VAMPIYAH, I'M A VAMPIYAH, I'M A VAMPIYAH
Opera's interface can be made very very complex if you know how to mess with the customisation
12True
threat has been detected
If I saw Inception on TV I'd probably think meh.
A stream within a stream within a stream within a stream within a stream within a stream within a stream within a stream within a stream within a stream
324545 levels
Since I'd already seen it and once you've seen it I don't think there's much rewatch value.
Where as if I saw the Matrix on TV I'd HAVE to watch it.
The only roles Keanu has ever gotten right was in the Bill and Ted movies, and in the remake of the Day the Earth Stood Still, the latter of which he nailed because it called for him being an alien being completely devoid of the ability to display human emotions, so basically himself.
I'd be compelled too.
Kind of like the terminator being the perfect part for Arnold
Exactly.
12Also, did you hear about the new Motorola Triumph Virginmobile is going to be offering?
12http://www.virginmobileusa.com/cell-phones/motorola-triumph-phone.jsp
heh are you looking at Pokemon
pokeporn
He can't really play humans though, not unless they're stoners.
mwahaha
Well, like, that's, y'know, your opinion, man.
Or maybe psychopaths, Keanu could probably make a good psycho killer.
dat theme song
12The fact that Virginmobile is going to be offering Motorolas is pretty awesome
BUM BUM BUM
=D
I WANNA BE THE VERY BEST
i will travel across the land
Hmmm?
searching far and wide
dun dun dun
I didn't see anything wrong with his acting in the Matrix.
What acting?
i know kung fu
>_>
Everyone was a little stiff in the matrix
Gary MotherFUcking Oak
Whatever.
You guys have weird opinions.
Like 10th doctor not being best when he clearly is.
his acting is fine I guess
12lol You know what a Motorola is right?
And Matrix not being great which it clearly is. :P
I hear an echo
dat Pokemon Blue opening
Pokemon Blue <3
Matrix is a classic, but it's a little overrated
Those were the days.
and Tennant is indeed amazing
green pokeball FTW
but the other guys have their moments too
ONIX IN DA HOUSE!
1998 man

Running around on his own at 10.
Anypony else ever notice that Gengar and Clefable share the same base body?
And now that I'm 10, I can LEAVE HOME
Ash should be like 25 by now
Milf.
MFW Ash is apparently 8 or something in the latest series.
03Why is that surprising
03motorola makes phiones
lol, Dragonball GT
03*phones
03not baby manaphys
When my kid turns 10 I'm gonna buy him a lizard and kick him the fuck out
mfg Robin Williams plays Professor Oak in the live action Pokemon movie
LOL
mfw..
dat title card
I jews chew
There's a...Live action...Pokemon movie?
Parents are useless in this series, really who lets their ten year old children wander around with FIRE BREATHING MONSTERS?
I choose you... ADRIAN ANDREWS!
XD
great judges of character
12lol
o hai Dodrio
12Because Virginmobile is pre-paid
I so hungry.
03so?
Gary's hoes
Now I know how Sprinkles feels.
03they have Samsung phones, why not Motorola?
And that's just in the old games, it's even more ridiculous after Diamond and Pearl where they face FUCKING GODS.
remember when Mew was God
GARY-SAN TO YOU, BITCH
Gary's balls
12That'
Remember when we thought EV's were a glitch? XD
12Kind of what I was saying
Gary always got the bitches
12that's*
remember how Mew was under that truck
NEPOTISM
good call TTG
He was totally wasted
Ash got high this morning
MFW Oak is banging Ash's mum.
MFW Oak is Ash's dad
Gary and Ash are half brothers.
yesh
Why's he got those empty balls laying around?
Didn't the kids take them?
I'll TAKE IT!
its Pokemon I ain't gotta explain shit
Aidsemon I choose you.
D'awwwww
lol, gummy
haha Dash
PUNNY
As expected, you balls are tiny
is that Tracey's clone or something
Mexican cousin
Ah
That'll be good for, what, two days?
I'm a big kid now!
I AM a big pony.
Fuck you Ash. I AM YOUR MOTHER AND YOU WILL OBEY ME.
INB4 everyone is banging Ash's mum.
a week later Ash died of starvation in the Viridian forest
yeah, all ten year olds can take care of themselves in the wild
Including Pikachu.
RETURN
You gotta say return
fire the laser
That's not even how you get them to go back inside
I remember back when Pikachu was actually cute instead of being an annoying little rodent that Ash clearly used a Game Genie on.
One question, where did Ash get his basic education?
EVERYONE DIED
what level is Pikachu now
200
244
There aren't any schools.
>Implying Ash graduated Pre-K.
9001
heh.
He needs to change his underwear now >>
ah yes the rubber gloves
Yes.
This the first episode?
D'aaaawwwww, pikachu.
Yeah.
I like how Ash sounds a little like Rudolf
Yes
12Anyways, how was your day drf?
Somehow Ho-Oh appears in the first episode.
Pikachu is an ass
03fine
Even though it doesn't exist yet.
03and about to be over, I'm about to go to bed
"Fuck you stupid human, you're destined to repeated failure at the Pokemon League EVERY. FUCKING. TIME!"
Foreshadowing
I am your master obey me
12Same here XD
Ah, the only episode that actually happens, with everything else being a coma dream.
What kind of stupid mom would let their kid wander around a country which has wild abominable monstrosities walking about the countryside?
Same.
He dosent have a high enough badge to control pikachu yet
Unless this was a plot by Ash's mom to get him killed.
Yeah...
He doesn't have enough badges to control the level 21231231 pikachu
That's canon.
hmm..
Nopony would blame her.
12 I think everyone is finally borking xD
I WONDER
Durrrr, Raichu
CHARAZARD
I like the episode where Ash dies.
SHIT
Then leaves his body.
I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKITUNG
FOREVER
Ash is a greedy bastard.
why didn't Ash catch a Pidgey and then evolve it into a Pidgeotto instead of catching a Pidgeotto fill out your damn Pokedex kid
It was obviously snorlax
POACHER!
the hat flip back it's on now
HOLD B
Catching a wild bird who never did anything to you. What a bastard.
press down on the D pad
lol hold B
How is Pikachu staying balanced?
I remember doing that....
yuu.
set up some traps..
Now bash it over the head and catch it
Man, I remember back when this was the coolest thing ever... for all of a few months.
Sandstorm.
Trolle'dex
I don't really watch the show anymore but I still play the games
Hate that move.
RA TA TA
even the new ones
The new season is actually pretty good.
purplest rat
XD
Top percentage Rattata
Team Rocket got an upgrade to badass ninjas.
hahaha, Poke'dex is trollin
I haven't played a pokemon game since the first generation.
Ash is a dumbass.
>:V
I have seen some episodes but I never wake up anymore
I played the hell out of Silver, and not much of any other
Jessie kicked Pikachu's hacked ass with a FLYING TYPE.
Spearow is evil
It's not very nice.
It was glorious.
dat monochrome
Hey, it's self defence! Ash attacked it for no reason, it's perfectly reasonable that it would fight back.
Spearow is jelly
Jealous yet don't want to be cought.
caught*
wut
am I the only one who has played all the generations
Mmm, Spearow jelly.
SPEEEEE ROOOOW
12Good night everyone
I played everything before black/white, and HG/SS.
Ash about to get owned.
Pikachu: Fuck yes.
I've played them all, though if they don't do better with the next gen that might change.
Don't remember there being so many different poke'mon outside the starting city
Black and White is the first generation where I honestly can't stand even one of the starters.
Dildo?
I kinda like the Pig
no the pig sucks it s a repetitive type combination
I reminds me of p-chan from Ranma
/me is being pedantic
hello Misty
A kid you gonna follow around for the next few years
when did you get here
I can't look at it without thinking I'd rather have the original fire/fighting, Blaziken.
lol, a hospital that says "We hope to see you again"
Nigga stole mah bike
ded
sadface
The water starter would be awesome if they used the bipedal stance they've shown in some of the artwork wielding its swords.
If pikachu had just attacked the pidgey like ash wanted in the first damn place, none of this would have happened
And I. AM. TAALKING.
Sunglasses Squirtle
Instead it ends up looking like some hideous otter/unicorn abomination.
goddamn it's thundershock and it's super effective use it already
Think of every black day I ever STOPPED you
And then
dat BGM
AND THEEEN
Bam
Do the smart thing. Let someone else try first.
Owned.
Ash got owned.
and Ash is still in a coma
You know, comparatively speaking to a lot of the seasons since, this first season was actually really well written.
Yeah, I like it
good old 4kids
Random Ho-Oh.
Ho-Ohly SHIT
foreshadowing..
lol
FAR foreshadowing
they showed a G2 pokemon legendary in the first episode of the first season hot damn
We've really hit rock bottom when we've got fucking ice cream cone Pokemon. >_<
We should watch the episode where James has boobs.
I'm down
then ash gets his ass kicked by misty
SONIC RAINBOOOM
Chandelier pokemon too.
The story of a ten year old boy and his enormous yellow taser mouse
and then they banged
where is the Pokerap
waarghlbarghl
Polkamon, Polkamon, everybody Polkamon
ok, I got to get some sleep. Catch you all later.
You know, next generation they should really toy around with Pokemon that have conflicting types, like fighting/flying, or fire/ice.
peace out
will there ever be a light type?
FIIIRE AND IIIIICE
the answer:no
I want my Bug eevee
I always assumed psychic was supposed to be the light type.
ground eevee
they have a bug/fire if that counts
so dark beats light that's kind of depressing
i think psychic is just a mental thing
look at me fanboying
Unless you're one who believes darkness isn't inherently evil or light good.
hmmm
is there an electric/ice type
Darkness was originally meant to be evil
like, shadow, or oni, or something
Hrm, I can't think of any, there are a few water/electric though.
what about Ghost where does that fit in
yeah Lanturn is good
never had a Lanturn in my in-game party tho
is this that clip
I'd like to see more Pokemon with typings like Lantern, two opposing types.
fire/water
I raised a shiny lanturn once, it was green
would be cool
It was a Green Lanturn *trollface*

just run away guys
are they really saying crappy
I though she was naked for a second =\
I saw this episode as a little kid on a local tv station
buuuu
wow they recognized them holy shit
MidnightStar: It isn't aired anywhere though?
Because they're just in uniforms, not disguises
Apparently it's been shown only twice in the US.
I think I saw it back in the day
Despite it disguises just as much as the average disguise
but I'm pretty sure they cut "that scene"
With the James scene removed.
LOCAL TV station, they got shut down a few years ago
The bewbs part was there when I saw it
TO THE SUN
disguise/uniform same thing
So it was in Japanese?
also I don't remember Misty being a waitress
but maybe that's just my bad memory
It was a local tv station, they pirated most of the stuff they aired
and/or sexual repression
Shit that's a big bird
lol pwnd
Wut
lol what
BASTARDS.
Those bastards?
"Those bastards!"
there are swears in the original
Or saying "THOSE BASTARDS" in the japanese equivalent isn't as offensive as saying it in english is
evolve your Pokemon damn it
yes that too probably
well it was dubbed by 4kids
usually it's just "TIMEEEE"
there is a baseball player named Antonio Bastardo

well he becomes less of an ass over time
Oh.

I never watched that far.
Gary's a "friend" wink wink, nudge nudge, say no more, say no more.
i didn't really either i just read on bulbapedia
He wasn't as much of a douche after johto

Is it just me or does Gary intentionally show off to Ash to try and impress him?

about time Hot Topic got pony shirts
FiM is right up their alley
Ew, Hot Topic.
I bought some Donkey Kong juice there once
that sounds wrong
I know, I know, but they're the kind of people to sell PPG shirts, etc
So is Spencers.
Hot topic also doubles as an exotic sperm bank
Don't have one of those
We need to get Pony shirts at Walmart.
that would be nice
but it'll be a while
I would totally get a 3 luna moon shirt
Walmart rules the world, therefor once ponies have infiltrated every aisle of Walmart we will be one step closer to world domination.
wahaha
We don't even have Walmart over here. :P
WAT
I want a rainbow dash why wub woo shirt
Though Waitrose is owned by Walmart.
in Britainland
isnt asda also
I doubr ir.
it*
>Implying anypony cares about Britain for the purposes of world domination. :p
<3 @ baby big mac
thought it was though could be wrong
was Granny Smith ever young
Why not?
I've seen fanart of young granny
yes FANart
It's actually a sound business tactic, if you own both competing companies it doesn't matter which people shop at you still profit.
Lots of companies around here own competing brands. They tend to use them in different markets.
the hell is this?
oh, lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAPXj-yVGLc
On the other hand we also have Future Shop/Best Buy which can at times be found literally right across the road from each other.
Well I know Waitrose is owned by Walmart, I'm fairly sure that's the only one though.
And you get people storming out of one, only to buy stuff from the other.
I've not heard of any others being owned by Walmart too.
>MFW Target is getting exclusive rights to both two different Pinkie Pies and the Luna toys and I've never even seen a Target. :(
Hm.
We don't have Target either.
Never seen one here either.
How do they expect me to complete my Pinkie Pie collection when only Target will carry the last two I need?
nor have i
Oh, I got it wrong then.
do you have Dunkin Donuts
Waitrose isn't owned by Walmart.
Just Asda.
Meh.
:p
I shoulda got those McDonalds ponies
You can probably find it on Ebay or amazon, Dee
jpony: No.
Yeah, but you pay like twice the price. :(
i know when to keep my mouth shut ^^
unfortunately I didn't find out about ponies until they were almost done selling
/me has no ponies
MFW we haven't and probably won't ever get McDonald's ponies.
Or any other pony merchandise. T_T
I found a mcdonalds twilight sparkle in a gutter once
that's sad
I got my McDisgusting's Pinkie like two days before they stopped carrying them. I kind of regret not getting the Cheerilee though.
WUT
haha, pinkie
remember when noone knew who Cheerilee was
XD
I got a regular Cheerilee at Walmart the other day though. Hasbro y u no get Cheerilee's cutie mark right?
I have a bubble pinkie and the normal flutter
The toy has one of the yellow smiling flowers and then two small burgandy flowers with no smiley faces.
I long for the day when hasbro releases a pony set that gets the ponies right
LOL
dat bgm
Penis joke?
rockin
The sad part is it even has a picture of Cheerilee with the proper cutie mark on the back of the package.
lol fail
wtf

reminds me of Octavia ff
Just look at the adorable Luna and you won't ever want to go to bed. :p
what was the awesome one with mr bridge
It looks like she's threatening me
eeyup
"If you go to sleep I'll kill you"
she sure is
that's the idea
/me wants to hug Luna.
indeed
"Can't sleep, Luna will kill me."
/me rocks back and forth
earthquake episode/porygon episode
aka banned episodes
Sound of Sunlight, that was the one
please no porygon episode
that one awesome Octavia fanfic
Has the earthquake episode ever even been shown in Japan?
I don't think so
Would anypony even have a copy of it to upload then?
not me
Not I, said the dog
"The episode didn't even end up as a DVD exclusive.
"
It's never been released.
dun dun dunn
That's what I thought.
Such a shame
I really wish they weren't so sensitive over earthquakes
I mean they're natural disasters they're not going to stop anytime soon
but I guess I understand
they haven't even used the attack in the show since that episode got banned
Eh, I can understand delaying an episode for a few weeks after an earthquake, but I can't understand never releasing it at all.
Ponies the anthology?
I dunno, I think you can find the offending scene on youtub
agreed
e
YES
Oatmeal, Are you crazy
no one pony should have all that powah
move the window
No one pony should have all this friendship
Ponies how do you make even a shitty Kenya East song tolerable?!

o-o
So
First I accidentally my iPhone earphones in washing machine
-SGD$50
Then my desktop speakers blow out
-SGD$60
;-;
But hey
At least the replacement speakers I got are great
Though they look... awful
Bulky
The bass is amazing on these ones though
Minnet: reload your time functions
L[a]korv: I reloaded time.lua.
Minnet: reload your commands
L[a]korv: I reloaded the command files.
Minnet: how long has it been since Utøya?
L[a]korv: Pardon, what did you say?
L[a]korv how's the situation in your country?
mourning.
Also, is that the 'correct' spelling for Utoeya?
Eeep.
yup.
Minnet: reload commands
gah.
I hate hard spaces, they always kill her.
Minnet: how long since the Oslo bomb?
:|
D:
oh well.
Utøya
AltGr-L for ø
bbl
because if not, I'm going to shut it down
Oh, no, it exploded this one time and then we couldn't get on it if I remember correctly
But no, I found out to host servers so I should be good anyways
Ah okay, cool
Minnet: how long has it been since the Utøya shooting?
L[a]korv: It has been 1 day, 5 hours and 44 minutes since the Utøya incident, which occured at 2011-07-22, 15:15 UTC.
Minnet: and how long since R4 & al. in Oslo were bombed?
L[a]korv: It has been 1 day, 7 hours and 34 minutes since the Oslo incident, which occured at 2011-07-22, 13:26 UTC.

Sorry....
These new replacement speakers I bought aren't too shabby
Oh, what brand?
Creative
T10
My old speakers blew out
:(
Nice
I think Creative reduced the price
I got a 6 part speaker set of it
Its nice
Nice
The ones I have have better bass than the previous ones I think
You can definitely feel it
Mids sound a bit bad though
Your old ones blew out, so i think too xDD
It was only the left one
Distortion, stuff
Mmhmm
For a good driver, go realtek
lol
Heh
And yeah
I couldn't care less about high quality audio/speakers
The ones on my laptop are fine :D
Creative's website is listing a markdown from SGD$79 to SGD$59

Dermathil! Sathi!
Oh yea we saw some Dr Who earlier Dermathil
ah
nice.
I'm starting to think that putting CUBE forward if I win the lottery wouldn't be the best use of the win. I'm thinking of Blade Runner now.
7Hello Dman, Hello Dermathil
7How are you all today?
I am feeling nostalgic...I am thinking of Milo and Otis
7How come?
I'm here. And hi Sathi.
7wb ;)
7I wonder which movies will be picked during the lottery tonight
7If I ever get picked don't worry I won't ask for the titanic ;)
If I get picked we watch Blade Runner.
7Good choice
7and as B?
CUBE
Cube's my choice since movie night #3
and I certainly am not dropping it.
I'm a big Sci-Fi fan.
I'm the kind of guy who could also suggest 2001 as the A movie.
7as long as it's not 2012...
nope.
7the horror! the horror
exactly.
the special effects were nice though.
7yea but the storyline is meh
yep
that's what happens when you use a fad as the basis for the story.
7fad?
So 3 hours till the show starts?
I wonder if there'll be a preshow today
hopefully there'll be.
Yee
Do any of you know that The Day after Tomorrow is?
also
fad: An intense and widely shared enthusiasm for something, esp. one that is short-lived and without basis in the object's qualities; a craze
I have the limited edishun DVD with a ... 3dpopart thingy cover
^^ aka what some thing the ponies are when they are sadly mistaken.
nice Dman. did you like that movie? (TDAT)
in terms of realism lol
now, 2012 was a comedy, i swear
7I'm sure there will be a pre-show, just don't know what yet :)
Moar Snatcher?
hey Dermathil Blade runner aired yesterday in UK ^^
on BBC
Sathi as a mod can you stream anything whenever you want? :P
7Well i'm not a streamer (yet) maybe in the near future
http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511X1QYW91L._SL500_AA300_.jpg cover's holographic : P
Sathi - you have to be appointd steramer?
7oh dear god...
7Well streaming also depends on connection / pc setup.. Some modponies would be unable to stream
: /
7Also preparing dinner so if i'm a little slow.. you now know why :)
I remember applying for a mod, around the time RainBroDash did too.
nice, Dman. (both the cover and the airing)
=]
7Did you use the e-mail adress or the webform?
Yea, I applied for mod, and one of the questions was these 3 NSFW pics, and what you would do. I think I was too soft, and that's why i didn't get any further ;(
For what, sathi?
7when you applied for becoming a mod, i'm just wondering
couldnt you use the iplayer on their websiter dermathil
oh, I applied via email, then was taken HERE for some PM interview
with ghosties and hipster_brony
7yea I had that too
How'd it go for you?
/me 7points at her color
7I think it went good
I mean, did you get a second interview? or an email saying 'ur a mod'?
winter-Puff: I didn't know they had an iplayer.
Demrathil I thought BBC iPlayer was UK only?
ahhh
7Hmm after the interview they pretty much told me
well they do
http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00plcmt/Blade_Runner/ try to access this see if it works : )
Dman: I don't know nothing about their iplayer.
try the link >_<
nope not available in area
Sathi - oh ok. did you say oyu'd kick / ban for any of the pics?
ahh sucks
7yes
I just wanna know what I did to not be a mod : / and try and apply again in like a week. I've been here since pretty early on continuously and wanna be a mod whaaa~~
I'm also nearly always the first to go 'no colour u silly' or 'this is what we're watching: blablabla' when somepony asks >_<
7no-colour is no longer needed
7the server does that ;)
really?
9test
Yea i found that out afterwards
but before that was implemented ... : P
7Dman PM
0it didn't work?
ALSO you see that pic up there? Silverscreen had one with too many lines?
and I with a few others said it should have less lines
0what pics?
and I made the pic you now see in paint : P and posted it here. Silverscreen was there
yeah, I was around when that happened. I was among those saying it needed less lines.
Yea i think you were
so I microsoftpaint'd it up and silverscreen used our design : D
yep. I remember.

I was getting a lifeguarding license or something

It was good.
and there was this huge party afterwards
dsnesmith was it pony?
and pinkie pie was the host
Silverscreen: one of my top 2010 movies.
it was totally rad
hipster_brony http://yeahbutton.com/ forl ater use ; )
there was pink everywhere
cupcakes and pastries
: / i want a dream
8Zecora theme song here
Mrs. Cake even showed up
The beginning was waaaay too damn fast for anyone to pick up on unless you were 100% focused on it.
thx
But after that, it was great.
was it tail twitching for pinkie falling stuff? that's what i put
@silverscreen that's why you watch it a hundred times :P
8lol, i meant the character XD
I've seen inception way too many times now
same
it's like holy grail, I can say the dialogue along with the actors now
Silverscreen: I actually understood everything of the plot since my #1 movie reviewer said to listen to the plot.
i've never seen holy grail ... yet : p
Tell me, mistah cobb... how wouldyoulike to go home?
you can't fix that! nobody can!
The dream is collapsing...
Minnet: What's the time in AST?
8BRRRRRRRRRRRRM
JUST LAK INCEPSHUN
'mistah cobb has a job offah' 'whakindalik a work placement' 'not exactly'
Saito's accent is so great
Ay bought de airline. Eet... seemed cleaner.
Minnet: What's the time in AWST?
DSNesmith do u think that inception was a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within ?
Minnet: What's the time in AEST?
The only thing I don't get about the movie is...DID SAITO GET OUT OR NOT?!
Hmmm. oO
You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, Darling. *pulls_grenade_launcher_out*
I think the level where Michael Caine's character exists is reality
Dermathil: My favorite line. :D
Dermathil YES
YES YES
8of course he did silver
what?
ow
I just realised
sorry, I'll fix that bug.
they made it ambiguous to make it seem like they were being cool and artsy
but was it all a dream guys? SERIOUSLY i rewatched it a few days ago and grandfather says -come back to reality. and the
to "seem"?
she just sees A"EST" and thinks EST.
8agreed
old people who come there and dream is their reality and the guy in charge sais to Leo 'you can hardly talk' 0_o
I'd hate to see it out of control.
well then he certainly failed to impress me with that movie :P
@Dman, I thought he was still dreaming at the end when I saw it the first time
but upon rewatches
I've concluded he woke up to reality
Oh Black Luster Soldier and MLP, no one must ever know of our forbidden love.
DSNesmith i thought he was awake but upon rewatches now believe it's all a dream so he inception's 4 times
lol
Black Luster Sodlier? The Yu-Ghi-Oh card?
I was half expecting him to get shot in reality and wake up to Mal
I've heard some really crazy theories though
THE BAMBOOZLED CELTIC GUARDIAN 'i'm so bamboozled'
dsnesmith tellm e about it
like, Saito is sent into a dream to rescue Cobb from his delusions
Dman: it can be interpreted as a dream or as reality, since the spinner seems to fall.
by Mal
and he orchestrates the entire plot
it wobbles a little dermathil yea
Minnet: reload time functions
Lakorv: I reloaded time.lua.
Minnet: reload commands
it was very convoluted I don't remember all the details
Lakorv: I reloaded the command files.
Minnet: what's the time AEST?
Lakorv: The time is currently 03:17:23 AEST, Sun 2011-07-24.
:>
it deserves ANOTHER rewatch : P
and then of course there's the purgatory theory
you were right and I guessed right.
that one is silly though
Dman: in the other dreams it doesn't wobble at all.
Great Mouse Detective
but the Saito theory
The spinner falls throughout the movie, so he isn't in a dream. :/
has the entire team representing Cobb's psyche
Saito: I bought the airline. It seemed neater.
That's the whole point of the spinner.
the spinner wobbles alittle at the ending but never collapses
@silverscreen
the way a totem works
is that it has different phsyics than normal objects
:<
so the person who's dreaming will make it act like a normal item
yea
To make it unique to the holder of the totem, I get that.
but person woh it belongs to knows
06back from party
if it acts oddly, you're not in someone else's dream
yes
if you're in your own dream
your totem is worhtless
cuz only u know what it SHOULD ACTUALLY do yea
also this song = disney furry porn
what dsnesmith said
wut
LU, TUNE IN NAO
oh, hi silverscreen
go watch 'let me be good to you' on youtube
http://radionintendo.com/listen.m3u ;D
it's disney furry porn
no joke
So the whole thing was Mal's dream?
The problem is that Cobb's totem, everybody knows that it does. Which is to spin and topple.
Oh i didn't make it in time >_
lol seen it bfore dsnesmiht
>_>
I don't think so, I think she's dead
but anyway
totems
06already?!
06one hour early!
let's use the chess piece as an example
I don't even remember the mouse being hot in that movie.
I better get a shower before Jaws
Ariadne mods the chess piece to always fall one way, and to not roll
/me is listening to DSNesmith while enjoying fine wine
You know what it SHOULD do, but if he was in the dream, he would have been able to keep it from toppling over throughout the movie. THat's why he holds the gun while he spins it. If he keeps it spinning, he shoots himself to wake up.
but only she knows the proper weight
quite
so if she's in someone else's dream
she doesn't actually have her totem
06I'll tune in in 20 min or so .p
7red orwhite?
she has that person's image of her totem
and it will behave by the DREAMER'S physics
not hers or reality's
Sathi red or white?
6FUKKEN ARISTOCATS
Arthur: PARADOX.
so the chess piece will act like a normal one
instead of her special modded one
7wine ;)
yes
for another example, Arthur's die
Isn't it easy to gauge the weight of something?
will fall randomly
because the dreamer doesn't know it's loaded
that's the thing, Axel
Oh right me! Sorry Sathi, I meant I was enjoying DSNesmith's talk
>implying white wine is worth your time
BUT
they're specially weighted
Red wine always. white only for big dinners
to be AGAINST expectations
okay and this is the weird one
on its own, has to be red Sathi : )
the top
IMDB is such a good place to find movie quotes.
the reason it never falls
Exactly. My totem would most likely be a little wolf.
7good choice ;)
is because the dreamer doesn't know the weight of the top
An Architect can make everything except carpet convincing to the brain.
Dermathil i have IMDB opened on black dynamite quotes
very good dman
Sathi well what would you go for? : P
so the physics of the top are basically in limbo, no pun intended
7red of course
Silverscreen, are you going to make movie trivia? (or are you still on a dial-up?)
also, obligatory: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmHAqgAFt6E
so it spins forever
I could find movie trivia if anyone wants ^_^
This is good stuff DSNesmith : )
yeah I did research on this :P
because the movie was so confusing but amazing
6Duh.
do aren't you a mod anymore silverscreen?
yes
I'm still running on dialup.
okay here's a crazy one for all of you
the kicks back up the levels
i have like 4 bluray movies only, and Inceptions one of them
the way that saito's aging works out
because hey, if Dicaprio was in limbo just as long as Saito
darnit. When will you be able to do movie trivias again Silverscreen?
DSNesmith how do you mean?
he should be old in the intro too, right
so get this
he's down in limbo with mal, fischer, and ariadne
listening
Hello brownies
saito is lost somewhere down there too
6Wow, the thread got buried really quick.
he kills mal
7Hello Ziltoid
but she stabs him
so he's bleeding out
the kick comes
um whats this?
Ariadne takes Fischer back up
sup Ziltoid : )
the hospital explodes
yes
yea
alright, showertime
waking up ariadne, fischer, and the guy who's name I forget
cyall in about 20 minutes.
damn what's his name
the cool british guy
C ya Dermathil
anyway
they all wake up
I too should shower soon
but this is the neat part
kk Xeli
that level ceases to exist
because no one is awake in it
hmm yes
so....
so now we've got level 1, 2, and limbo
. . . . FUCK
okay, the elevator explosion goes off
DSNesmith WOW
they all wake up except saito and cobb
level 2 disappears
level one
>is on /oat/
they're in the car underwater
they all get outside of it except cobb
cobb bleeds out in limbo
yea
he shoots back up to level 1
then drowns in the car
6I know.
but lvl2 and 3?
meanwhile, saito ages down in limbo like 50 years
6But it got like, no replies. =/
2 and 3 don't exist anymore
no one awake in them
DSNesmith this is incredible
notice how they left someone awake on each level
There are four levels, though.
sec i'm saving this in notepad!
inception?
limbo is a variable level
Top level which is the city. Second level is the hotel, third level is the hospital, and fourth is Limbo.
limbo is the level that is n+1, n being the number of constructed worlds made by the architect
k got all that on notepad so far
threads like that usually dont
Yea DSNesmith
so if they'd made two levels
and died on level 2
they'd have gone to limbo
He should've used a toenail clipper as his totem.
if they made 14
and died
they'd go to limbo at lvl 15
and died on lvl 14 yea
also this song fucking rocks
why are we not watching rarity sing
yeah it does
Watching Mulan just for this scene. everyone does this.
what thread?
Mulan was actually a good movie
very good
one of the last good animated disney ones
the thread on Oat
i have VHS and DVD : )
What part of Mulan?
I never watched it
D:
and it came after the atrocious pochohauntus and hunchback
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/36267469.html
/me bops zitloid on the head
What thread on /oat/?
6I wonder how The Brony Show gets stickied all the time... might be because their thread is only up right before their show starts...
So, Cobb died again when the 4 layer collaped?
nicely
Frollo was great, but the rest of HoND was terrible
what
4 layer didn't collapse
hunchback was good
Hunchback was pretty ok, not atrocious
but isn't their show weekly?
limbo didn't explode, cobb got shot by saito
all very interesting
who then shot himself
6It is, Silver.
Guys i'm gonna go eat and shower should be back before show!
and then limbo ceased to exist per se
see limbo is a blank slate
7Enjoy dman!
7See you in a bit
Isn't that a bit of preferential? I mean, it's no different from our thread....
I still don't get how he went from the billionaire son's dream to saito's dream.
the only reason it had all those buildings and stuff
Thank you Sathi see ya in a while
was because cobb had been there before
everyone
6Their threads get stickied right before their shows...
limbo is the collective unconcious
it's kinda Jungian
they're all linked through the machine
and they share dreamspace
limbo doesn't have a dedicated dreamer
6Yeah, but it might be because their threads are put up like, a couple hours before thier shows and taken down after their show ends.
6Whereas ours are up all week.
whoever's inside it, is dreaming
not the selection thread.
is this the micheal bolton version?
That goes up for three days at the most.
or the good one
lol
6Well, we don't do Selection Threads anymore anyway...
there's your answer :P
i have actually asked on /meta/ that threads like that not get stickied
sigh
I loved this movie
I still do
so much parental bonus and greek mythology references
6Since dari can take the list straight off the chat.
6And I know you have, Hipster.
plus, Hades
also, for future pre-shows: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1GRj6CNSGg
oh, cool.
lol
is my hair out?
yeah, Hades is one of the better Disney villains
dont play it today though cuz its better with the video
the list probably goes
Frollo>Hades>Scar>Everyone else
has anyone made a Hellfire PMV yet?
Frollo is the best Disney villain
because that needs to happen
6Well, yeah.
6Maybe post-show.
holla holla get Octavia, sup bronies
6Frollo is hilarious.
6Hello Reticent.
I love 80's power ballads
HELLFIIIIIIIIYA BURNING IN MAH SKIIIIIN
oh teh noes DSNesmith
this is from the 90s btw lol
orly?
A man as the best Disney villain?
yarly
RBD brought up a good point on skype
another villain I liked
she's...entrancing 0.0
was actually from the recent movie
Tangled or whatever
the mother was interesting
we're gonna lose a shitload of fans on the FB page cuz of the brony purge
I liked the Huns from Mulan, they were dicks
because she wasn't some evil witch with super duper magic
on the 25th...nice.
she was this coldhearted, manipulative bitch
Brony purge?
Whut?
also yes huns rock
but they didn't get enough screen time :/
oh, I get it.
my profile got removed by facebook
Multiple accounts for bronies.
Huns are a historical villain, they didn't even need an evil backstory
6Facebook is killing profiles.
and so did a ton of other peoples
Huns pop ouy of the snow
LIKE DAISEYS
probably because of the nostalgia effect, I was always fond of Maleficent
I was surprised at how much I liked Tangled.
Huns have LEVERAGE
Killing pony profiles, right?
I really enjoyed Tangled
6Yeah, Silver.
it was a huge throwback to classic disney
which they haven't done in a while
yeah, I think Tangled was much better than a lot of people were expecting (myself included)
DON'T HURT ME
NO MORE
I prefer Stardust over it though.
I haven't seen it, can't get me to see it without Netflix or something because I'm too embarrassed to see kids movies in theatres
/me headbobs
/me bobs heads
a brony embarassed to see kids' movies?
lol
trololololo
/me hoofpumps
there are still closet bronies you know :P
another one for post show sprinkles: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PdOx24p14o
I saw winnie the Pooh at 16
no shame
what kid movies?
if it was MLP I would see the movie in an instant, but yeah, going to a kids movie, especially by yourself, is embarrassing
/me 12o-o
I prefer the term Wardrobe Brony
I saw Toy Story 3 alone
12suprise day off today
because I had the day off and no one else did D:
MLP the movie really sucked
<------------- bit of an anonypony
well Pixar is different
was glad I did though
Toy story made me cry manly tears
TS3 I was fine
>GOing to a kid's movie by yourself is embarassing - This is why I have an 8 year old cousin.
since it's already established itself as an "everyone" movie
I even made it through the incinerator
but that last scene
where he plays with bonnie
I was bawling
I'm in musical theator and wear purple converse. I figured people will think I'm gay/effeminate no matter what I do at this point
LL!
yeah
TUNE IN
@Mai /duh, why didn't I think of that :P
:D http://radionintendo.com/listen.m3u
12ohai SS
TS3 toyed with my nostalgia too hard.
:P
/me 12lucky then :3
and I was the only college-age kid in there
I see what you did thar Axel_Foaley
it was a bunch of little kids
so I got a lot of strange looks from the midgees
the actual show hasnt started yet, but im live with some Mega Man tunage
but idgaf, I was weeping
I cried in Harry Potter, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.
Good, because I don't.
So I found this channel on /oat/...slap me if this is stupid but what is it? xD
Oooh. "Toy"
Meh. Just walk into the theatre like a baws. Who cares what the people in the theatre think. It's not likely you'll ever see them again. :p
sup Mai, it's Brony Movie... afternoon?
I cried harder in Bridge to Terabithia
mai this is your life
Oh cool.
we watch movies and talk to each other
otensibly
I once saw Aliens v Predators, but they accidentally switched the reel with Pokemon, so we got the corny kids previews and 5 minutes of intro while the kids in the other theatre were pissing themselves to Aliens
/me 12o-o
MAH LIFE.
Not always in that order.
it's really more 'movies play while bronies snark and force memes'
12suprise day off
Funny. I've only ever snuck into movie with my family.
6OH GAWD
Sometimes we talk to each other and oh right there is a movie or something isn't there?
Heya LL
and write bad clopfic in chat
:3)
What movie's next, or do you know?
Like leverage
6THAT'S AWESOME
12hiyas :3
Jaws is up next.
/me 12stretches
jaws
@DSNesmith its not BAD
And HORSES: BRAVER AND FASTER...SIR
o.o
Awesome!
o.o My family steals together.
@reticentsmolder have you read Pizza Party
the black dynamite
that was very bad
12what?
then*
intentionally so
nope.jpg
But you really need to stay for Black Dynamite.
12I SHOULD be upset by it
12but it was a short shift oxo
you gig mai?
dig*
Black Dynamite was WAY better than jaws, at least in entertainment
aye
WHOO! GO INKY! GO INKY! IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY! IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY!
Black Dynamite > Jaws. However Jaws is one movie that NEVER needs to be remade.
nuthin
:3
/me huggles LL :3
Just don't interrupt his kung fu.
Agreed with everyone about BD
are we getting RainbowRolled?
@Axel_Foaley and yet it was...over and over
*everypony
Black Dynamite was totally unexpected
Alright, the one and only Dermathil is back.
6The B movie is almost always better than the A movie for the week. Almost.
This is Rainbow Trololol @DSNesmith
lottery today right?
And those remakes/sequels all failed. Except Deep Blue Sea
Except for those.... rare occasions
Godfather vs Battlefield Earth.
6Yes, Ziltoid.
errr Rainbow *Tylenol*
/me 12huggles back
Good morning, bronies!
Sprinkles: yeah. Though If I put Blade Runner as A movie then it's gonna be invalid.
Or afternoon.
Morning, DragonRage
sup DragonRage
Good Morrow
bad books are bad, bad food is bad, bad movies are good
okay guys
afternoon DragonRage
we need to get srs here
B movie next week has, HAS, HAAAAS to be Wicker Man
Eh, depends oh the bad movie.
well, 'bad' movies are more like fast food
hey mods, can I suggest a youtube vid while we wait?
Nope, DSNesmith. If I choose B movie then we getCUBE.
objectively bad, but it's still good
okay cube is lulzy
but Wicker Man!
aeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiouaeiou
12~
I saw Wicker Man in theatres thinking it was a different movie (I had no internet)
BTW, SirSprinkles, I do remember that a certain B movie was so horrible the one who suggested it was banned from suggestions. I doubt that B movie was better than the A movie of that week.
By bad do we mean cheesy or horrible?
oh but I could troll if I get picked
I know a movie worse than Spider's Web
That's why he said almost
@Dermathil it was Spider's Web
DSNesmith: Cube isn't "Lulzy". It is mindbending in an awesome way.
I know several actually
No need to NAME it ReticentSmolder.
but the worst
6I don't know what you're talking about Dermathil
Night Train to Mundo Fine
You found something worse than Spider's Web?
Smolder: It was Twilight, wasn't it?
~~~~
6We only aired an A movie that week.
exactly, SirSprinkles.
We should watch Godzilla vs Bambi.
Yes it exists.
;o
... do it
well at least you get to hear my show in full today :3
The only other week we did that was week 1 and I wasn't there.
Rules 1 and 2 of BMN
ooooh, we TOTALLY need to see a classic Godzilla movie
hey sirsprinkles are you streaming?
6Yes, DSN.
yeah
see if you can find a clip of godzilla vs bambi
Oh gods, this song.
DO THE MARIO!
because that sounds amazing
OH THIS
So many memories.
OH HECK YEAHJ
RIP Captain Lou.
Everybody walk the mario
I *LOVED* this show as a kid
Pony Mario?
I wanna be the fanboy has this when the mario boss dies. Freaking hard to survive.
12yays
DEEK
I wanna be
12:3
has anyone ever beaten IWBTG
in this chat
Nope
12~~~~~
Sadly no.
@SirSprinkles have you seen the youtube vid I, Brony?
Never played it.
I can't get to Mecha Birdo
YES
that freaking zombie level
I only beat half of it. The Metroid section burned me out.
I don't know what it is /bad with abbreviations
PONY POLKA
12oh, SS
I can't ever get past the zombies
12I finished Master Quest :3
yush
yay!
the Ghouls and Ghosts area is just awful
the spike tunnel
uuuugh
Lol
and the freaking bats
That spike tunnel is where I left off.
6Reticent, I've streamed it a few times.
6I love that vid.
The final parts.
This is all I could find on youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpBkc2jK-6w
good shit eh?
6NO LINKS! /obligatory
^^
but IWBTG had the best intro ever
Is Mousehunt an A or B movie?
start
/me nukes the link with his rocket lawnchair.
move left
/me 12was hoping that would add Ganon(dorf) to the Boss Gauntlet
WHAM SPIKE WALL
Diminutive and youtfhul equines of mine possession, oh yes, indeed, Diminutive and youtfhul equines of mine possession.
12but apparently not :/
6Mousehunt? Probably A...
move down avoid walls
suddenly OTHER WALL
Suddenly, i feel the most appealing urge to give an artistic display regarding the presence of diminutive and youtfhul equines of mine possession, and thus i shall proceed with performing the aforementioned act in a timely and considerable manner, my dearest companions. Diminutive and youtfhul equines of mine possession.
/me 12guesses it's because you can re-fight him naturally
go up instead of down
see apples
die to apple
/me just officially woke up. :/
avoid apple
jump over tree
Blade Runner is my A choice, CUBE is my B choice.
apple falls up and kills you
SIDEWAYS APPLE
@Nittany_Tiger feelsgoodman.jpg
and that was when I realized this was the greatest game ever
they are more like giasnt cherries
@Dermathil I second Blade Runner
6I have an amazing B choice... I have a lot of A choices, like Jaws, which we get to watch. : D
I wanted to do other things this Saturday.
Death fruit.
Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night is my B movie.
Delicious Fruit.
BTW, inb4 mods win the lotto this week :P
Oversleep is actually a bad habit I have.
I am a good movie finder.
I know quality.
lay it on us SirSprinkles, what movie, TELL ME TELL ME TELL ME
Falling down as A and reanimator as B
Finding a good A movie is easy. Finding a good B movie is hard.
CUBE is a good B movie.
Musicals make excellent B movies
wonder if galaxy quest is A or B
XANADU
B
Oh hell no. Not musicals.
I second Reanimator, on the grounds that I don't know what it's like but with a name like that...
xanadu is beyond a musical
other way round. There are tons of excellent a movie choices
Oh hell yes, musicals
but only few for the b movies
O hey what's going on?
>:D
Musicals: the movie version of Phantom of the Opera.
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOKLAHOMA where the wind comes rolling down the plaaaaaaaaaaaaains
I might pick Happily Ever After as the B movie since Backslide is the villain that movie and everyone would going "COFOUND THESE..." throughout the movie.
Space Mutiny is good
the reanimator is so fucking good
space mutiny
amazing
all the 80s hair
Repo the Genetic Opera is pretty B
Anybrony here seen Across The Universe?
I have
Gattica was a decent A
2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY is an A movie. No ifs or BUts.
Also seconding Repo, I really want to see that here sometime.
Hot Fuzz is my A
oh god
2001 is a snorefest
HEY
Gattaca was okay...
Mine too, Axel. :D
I can feel it DSNesmith
DON'T INSULT KUBRICK'S WORK
I can feel it
if only for uma thurman
DSnesmith I can feel it
not saying it wasn't an important film
DSNesmit, I can feel it
but it wasn't an interesting one
any movie requiring a time machine to become accurate is weird (ie 2001 since we're already past it)
I like how this song isn't so much a parody of Lady Gaga rather than an EXPLANATION of her.
all the parts with HAL are cool
but the 14 minute docking scene bored me to death
and the ending is ridiculous
Reticent: hey, that's like saying Blade Runner is weird too. Seeing how it is supposed to happen in 2019
Sex and the City: The first movie to be denied by the mods.
DSNesmith: that's because you haven't seen the sequel.
You know what else makes good Bs? 80s and 60s movies
Clue would be an excellent B
Sol: 2001 is a 60s movie.
we should watch Star Trek 2
See what I mean!
KHAAAAAAAAAAAN
TADAIMA (okaeri~~)
Star Trek 2: Wrath of Trixie.
Cult classics are also good Bs
I'm gonna stick to my CUBE and Blade Runner as my movie roster for the movie nights.
Would Road Warrior be an A movie?
03and sigh, woke up too late, so I won't have a chance to watch HP7.1 before I see part 2 >_>
loool
Both CUBE and Blade Runner are cult movies.
Dermathil - maybe i'll go with Cube if i'm picked : P
Really, anything that isn't still relevant/ doesn't have a huge budget
The Sound of Thunder movie
Pick of Destiny
How do guys determand if a movie is A or B
Dermathil don't you think cube is way more cult than blade runner thou? I do
8>sound of thunder movie
Dman: if you do and I get picked too we do Blade Runner - Cube. SCIFI NIGHT MWAHAHAHA
The Rock is great movie
hipster you seen it?
@Hipster_Brony DAT ENTRANCE
Dman: yeah it is.
DERMATHIL would be so much win
Tenacious D man
8THAT IDEA IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD
yea
muahahahaha
polka againz
oh we could watch manos
SilverMane is here, commence the shipping
ugh

Dman: Blade Runner attained cult status when it was released in the 1990s
no I can't do it not again

manos was... unreal
Yea my dad's a huge fan Dermathil ; )
/me official time: 3 minutes to notice my presence

hey guys, how you doing
Anything Cinema Snob reviewed

aww, really Dman? I am dissapoint
nooooooo
Minus the pr0n
Death to Smoochie?
sorry silvermane
me and Dman are planning to make the biggest night of awesome yet. Blade Runner and CUBE in the same night.
:):(:D:/:P:O;) Smiley party
and no caterpillar either
that movie is stupid and dumb
it's alright.
(if we do both get chosen in luck)
... ok then it's decided Dermathil i'll pick CUBE if i'm picked. I'd like to point out that it isn't my FAVOURITE movie thou, it's just a good idea of a pick
12o.o
just for you ; )
what is your favourite movie Dman?
um
I'm still looking for a good b movie to pick...
@Dermathil, I will put up Blade Runner, not sure about CUBE since I haven't seen it
would Men in Black be A or B?
it has an A budget for the time
A
B
a
if I get picked for B movie, we're watching House (1987), A movie is Toy Story 3
COOLFACE
damn
toy story 3? hasn't everyone seen that one already?
I think Treasure Planet is, because it means a lot to me. it was shown when big stuff happened in my live AND i resonate with the protagonist very well. LOVE the song 'still here' too
how about The Bed that Eats
6Men in Black is definitely A.
SHOO BE DO
6>has not seen Toy Story 3
MiB A movie obviously
6Spoil it and I kill you.
SIRSPRINKILES!
so A is high production value, B is low/ cult classic?
Prepare your tears
spoiler alert: the toys are made of plastic
ANDY WIN
Scott Pilgrim and Reefer Madness the Musical. GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
me neither, but everyone who wanted should've seen it...
oh wow
is this Disturbed polka
6I will seriously ban you if you spoil that movie.
Good point Dman. A movie or show can be horrible but mean a lot to you on a personal level
yep reticent
SOL wins CAKE!
@SirSprinkles challenge accepted
reefer madness... the musical?
True, Dman, Treasure Planet was good movie. Maybe the biggest Disney flop on a financial point, but a good movie still (SCI-FI again)
Yes
look at that Inky Pie, she dancing awesome
Reefer Madness is fucking hilarious!
poor treasure planet
the movie that killed 2d animation
hey Ghosties, how would you like to be shipped today?
You shoulda seen her earlier, Silvemane. She was dancing WITH NO MUSIC
Also, I learnt to enjoy Treasure Planet even more after reading Treasure Island.
Sorry guys just a sec mmy dad's on the phone
It's actually a parody of the original propoganda film
hey Ghosties
/me tempporarily leaves
I enjoy Treasure Planet less after seeing DisneyFan01's art
o hai ghosties
I hated Treasure Planet. Atlantis demolished it as an adventure movie.
I loved the original treasure island
But I do still enjoy it
atlantis!
great movie
I loved that one
Reefer Madness is hilarious, watched it 3 or 4 times last Fall
4@ReticentSmolder: I'd like to be shipped without too many handling fees
axel_foaley hates my favourite movie
Hey guys
Axel Foaley: you do know it is a sci-fi view of the treasure planet, right?
would from dusk til dawn be a b movie?
ohai ghosties
3 minutes
ooh we could watch 40 days of night
or Aliens
@Ghosties: I'm the mandatory shipping char, so you would co-star with me
actually, 1 minute 'til movies
or John Carpenter's The Thing
although people mgiht not be able to handle the Thing
There was a horrible mechanical Jar Jar in Treasure Island?
it's pretty gruesome
YES
RARITY
sorry guys im on da phone
all my <3s are belong to you
7tyt
=]
dunno how but rarity made this song awesome, which I thought was impossible
/me @ghosties : Ghosties was stuck in a tight compartment, waking with the taste of chloroform on his tongue. His hooves pushed against the confines of his container and the sides fell apart easily. Apparently whomever shipped him didn't splurge on handling fees.
0_o
In Atlantis, the treasure hunter KEPT the gold for once.
duh, it's cause ponies make everything better
Is that guy that wanted my Saw stuff here?
SHOW TIME
IT SAYS SO ON THE PAGE
okay chloroform should never be int he opening line of a shipfic 0.o

10gokaiger will depend on if sprinkles has it downloaded, since DCD isn't our streamer tonight
DSNesmith: 'Silly, that's not how you spell I LOVE FLUTTERSHY'

as far as I know, sgt sprinkles was pretty annoyed that cupcakes received that much attention
so cut him some slack, he prolly just thought it was a good joke
My custom pony was tasked by Celestia herself to exterminate SgtSprinkles.He succeded.
10DSNesmith, check your PM from me if you will :D
@cupcakes http://img823.imageshack.us/img823/9135/131137044705.gif

/me wonders if a quadruple brohoof is possible if two ponies lie down besides each other
THE BEES
OH GOD
NOT TEH BEES
...maybe it won't be horrible?
AAAA THE BEES
You can't even laugh as Bridesmaids because you're with Mom.
I doubt it though
chicago drove me nuts
I mean, it was a good play
Hope not. I'll take Dermathil's advice
but the 'heroes' were all such horrible people

/me He gave a startled yell as he plummeted through the cloud, hurtling toward the ground.
this makes me think of egoraptors shark parody...
/me is an earth pony

Sharks don't like larynxs apparently

instantly killing them is too mainstream

sigh, the black guy always dies first.
CIAMOUN Rainbrodash
What if sharks could walk on land?
so he picks of the pieces one by one
@DSNesmith but SilverMane IS a pegasus, how would time travel take his wings?
Elky: they don't kill instantly. They usually nom a leg off.
no he's not, he's a unicorn
or fly?
I thought Silverman was a unicorn...
If sharks could walk on land, we'd be screwed.

Doctor says "Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up." Man bursts into tears. Says "But, doctor...I am Pagliacci.
Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains. Fade to black.

Due to extensive research done by the Fourchon University of Science, diamond has been confirmed as the the hardest metal known the man. The research is as follows. Pocket-protected scientists built a wall of iron and crashed a diamond car into it at 400 miles per hour, and the car was unharmed. They then built a wall out of diamond and crashed a car
made of iron moving at 400 miles an out into the wall, and the wall came out fine. They then crashed a diamond car made of 400 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors. They crashed 400 miles per hour into a diamond traveling at iron car. Western New York was powerless for hours. They rammed a wall of metal into a 400 mile per hour mad

HEY GUYS DID YOU KNOW HER BOY IS DEAD

It's a Rougelike
Was her boy 35? That lady's old.

03yeah, the record label screwed up

I WANT TO MOLEST YOU
"Ummmm, sorry to interrupt, but I have no idea what's going on," Silvermane interjected. "Could anypony tell me where we are? This doesn't look like the ponyville I know."
Feeeeeeeeacnh

What is the weekly fanfic this time?

or is that a mod :P
@DSNesmith, you like it so far?

Minecraft's from 2010
btw quick poll everypony
well yeah
Elky: was it with the Complete mod? (updates the graphics to 2009, 1/5 of all the players dl'd it)
6He chose that because he thought it would be a so bad it's good thing...
sorry, Rainbrodash, want me to repost in /me?
what's scootaloo's cutie mark?
Maybe he'll get in a shark later.
6He's already explained his intentions to me.
Well it wasn't
lol
It was definitely a "
Good question DSNesmith.
Rainbow Dash
Very good Q

I'll get to that, she's wearing a flight suit yeah?

He ate my horcrux?
if we're doing time travel fic might as well do it properly
8Whoa, when did MonsieurLeFlour get here?
I figured as much. I don't know why I put it up to the mod room.
wait what?
how's the wife, monsieurleflour?
I mean, I realized that we'd allow Tacowiz and all that
hi monsieur
10"ReticentSmolder RETCON LIST: ORCHESTRA AND FLIGHT SUIT, IT IS SO" almost became a line in the fic. BREAKING THE SYSTEM AGAIN
Speaking of the lottery, when will we be doing it?
/me needs to hear an orchestra.
Suddenly, as said on ponychan, MonsieurLeFlour arrives saturday
DAMMIT! Who gave me 'Spreading Your Wings and Hers' to read? Now i'm getting major wing boner over here, and since it's 2nd person, I'm seeing Silver Mane in this story since he is a Pegasus!

Elky: well it is a 2006 game.
Where's Mademoiselle LeFlour?
03Police: Singer Amy Winehouse dies
03Amy Winehouse, the beehived soul-jazz diva whose self-destructive habits overshadowed a distinctive musical talent, was found dead Saturday in her London home, police said. She was 27.

that sounds SO dirty
he's here

I guess so, I'm not a gamer, so I maybe thought graphics were much better in 2006
RainBroDash dem 4 .pdf files
lol, /resits clipfic
Silvermane, I don't know who gave it to you, but you gave it to me and it's very distracting!
You know you like it Silvermane
/me waves at Dari
Yeah
DARI OUT OF NOWHERE
03a house without wine is better anyway
nah
We were talking about her in the pool
/me hides
/me Scootaloo turned to look at the strange stallion. "Now that you mention it, you do look familiar. I assure you though, this *is* Ponyville. You're almost in time for the 1013th Summer Sun Festival."
after party of one, ghosties
he was already here

03<usotsuki> [14:15] <@Io> Troubled singer Amy Winehouse, known for her smoky soul voice and her struggle with drink and drugs, has been found dead at her flat in north London, police said. She was 27 years old.
03<usotsuki> [14:15] <@Io> The Grammy award-winning soul singer with her trademark beehive battled with well-documented addictions that she documented in her hit single "Rehab". Her death is being treated as unexplained, Scotland Yard said.

/me Upon hearing this Silvermane gasped. He just celebrated the Summer Sun Festival two months ago, but that was the *1002nd* celebration. Realization dawned on him that he was still in Ponyville, but eleven years into the future!
the one Silvermane sent ya

Did the shark just jizzed?

Has anyone here actually eaten grass?
these two are so obviously in love
Hellfish.

How many levels of Rogue did Jaws take, anyways?
I have, Nittany_Tiger.
/me "Uuuuum, yeah, Scootaloo, you mind if we grab a bite to eat? My treat. I just want to thank you for saving me and all." Secretly he wanted to add 'and to ask where the last 11 years went'.
Lan sharks
Same.
no I'm not! yes you are! no I'm not! yes you are! I can't! yes you can!
When I was much younger.
8wanna pretzel?
suddenly drunk brody
Oh Silvermane, DSNesmith, i thought you were on about new ones. I have that .pdf since like 3 weeks ago : P
that pretzel!
Gief pretzel
note to self, don't piss off a peaceful town or else a lot of people will want your head
BUMP
GRammar. wanna = want to
Drinking game?
GLUG
Want a pretzel?
How do you want me to send you the txt file Hip?
/me "Sure," Scootaloo chirped, her brilliant blue wonderbolt's flightsuit shone in the mid-afternoon sun as she looked in the direction of Sweetie Bell. "Only if my friends can join too, I think we could all use a break."
Want to pretzel?
this fic has a 'Whoa' tag
can I read this without damning myself
How do I ate pretezel?
send it to sprinkles
Dman, read 'Kindness's Reward' if you want an amazing story of a ship, although it is not a clop-fic
well
DSNesmith i've read all dem : P
Silvermane : )
I'd like to pretzel.
just save it as a draft in the BronyState email account
hay everypony
DSNesmith, it's 2nd person starring Rainbow Dash
did you SAY he wanted a pretzel? no...well yes
10"although it is not a clop-fic" has become a clause in this conversation. I never thought I'd see the day
You have mighty fine taste in fics, SilverMane.
MFW I don't know the email account.
12kay
lol RainBroDash, too true mate
boat is sinking
>2nd person
oh, and can you take out duplicates that are using the same hostname?
and I'm outta here
lol elky
oh god it's a trixie fic
Yeah.
for the email
/me After carefully dusting off and replacing the fallen items on Appleblooms fashion cart, the two had beckoned for Sweetie Bell to join them, who had recently finished her session with the orchestra and was approaching them with a smile.
its BronyState@gmail.com
password is BRONYMOVIENIGHT
10@elky ">2nd person" was particularly entertaining
you running live clopfics *again*?
no but really, there's a reason second person is very, very rarely used in fiction
DSNeSmith, What's a Trixie fic? Tell meeeee.
all caps
There aren't any ATM, when should I get the list?
the fic silvermane mentioned
LL, you enjoying the show?
Someone better be saving these from reticentsmlolder and
Closer to the intermission?
10trixie/shy
inb4 jump scare
(because most of it is bad)
10dman I am, don't you worry
: D
Oh. Right the Fluttixie fic,.
2 minutes flat
even when I am getting killed do nothing
2nd person in fiction can be very interesting if done well
yeah, like 10 minutes before intermission or so
during teh ponies?
i will ask for a copy afterwards RainBroDash
anyone ever read the, uh
GET BACK ON DA BOAT
what were they called
Will do.
uh
uh
the magic of Recluse novels?
tbh, I've never read a good example
OH SHI
... no
DUUUUUUUUUUN DUN
I got... surprised by that.
"Sweetie, this is...ummm, who *are* you anyway?" SilverMane had to think fast. If this *WAS* 11 years from now he would have been labelled as kidnapped, or worse, for being missing so long. Without thinking he turned his head and looked at his uniform.
hunger games was 2nd person
He pissed the ocean
10dman it'll be on pastebin, providing photofinishhim and dsnesmith don't mind
that was good
Trixshy is my new favorite shipping, due to Kindness's Reward
Thought it was a barracuda.

Beware of the song
12yush

go ahead rainbrodash
huh, it was?
I don't always read 2nd person fics, but when I do, they're MetalHooves'.

I read a bit of the first book and I don't remember it being 2nd person
but okay...
BUM BIM

I know, mods only have colours

NO tooth no proof

Buster Browns
Dermathil It did? Today?
oh I'm sorry elky
>drama
0Pics or it didn't happen
I'm mixing up 2nd person and present tense
you're right, 2nd person blows
/me Silvermane could only look back at Scootaloo with a pained expression, 'think man, what kind of pony delivers pizzas?' "Oh, I'm Pizza Pony." He had meant to add a 'the' but it was lost in his nervous break down, and the damage had been done.
present tense can be interesting though
BOW CHICKA WOW WOW
present tense is okay...
4Laugh
2nd person is hard to write good in
4and grow FAT
i try to avoid it
lawl
trololololo pizzapony returns
10>the damage had been done.
oh here coems jeff goldblum moment
10epic line
Screw the safety of others, lets party!
And now SilverMane = Pizza Pony is canon
2nd person is epic thanks to the Old Spice Guy.
oh, uh, uh, this creature, is, uh, a machine
You try to avoid second person, because you find it to be hard.
Maybe Pizza Pony can be luckier this time?
make little sharks
i'm right! not crazy! MUAHAHHAHAHAHAH
it, erm, uh, all it, eh, does, is, eat and make LITTLE SHARKS, um yeah.
*looks at sign* wow, that sign sucks
the national geographic
Razyn, remember, it was a story within the story
Corrupt administrative people, don't know shit about safety procedures.
/me Scootaloo and the others stared at him hard, making him feel uncomfortable, but they quickly broke out into smiles and laughed. SilverMane would have laughed nervously too, if it wasn't at his expense.
and make little piece of shit
and, uh, I'm just saying that, uh, life will, uh, find a way
Second person is easy enough for a short story, but for an entire novel it'd be hella hard
4Why is that a good majority of creepy pasta is in second person?
second person also has very little payoff compared to the difficulty of writing it
horror works better if you put the reader into the story, elky
10@ghosties it can make it that bit creepier
not so much for other genres
hm, maybe
Silvermane we need to go deeper.
Sol: i should reiterate. i don't feel entirely comfortable writing in 2nd person
O_o my face when thinking of noodles at the mentioning of pasta
Reticentsmolder lives in TEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-EEEEEEEEEEEEXAS http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pZxKTGG4N_8/TiVINRtX8-I/AAAAAAAAIy0/oKSedDnEnW4/s1600/Capture.PNG
it's not familiar territory for me
Hey SilverMane fans! Guess who is here!
Choose-Your-Own-Adventure tend to be creepypasta hence the second tense.
4...sure, I guess. I think 1st person would be better, but that's me
ME!
actually, the only published second person I've read are those goosebumps CYOA books
MINDBLOWING GRAPHICS
2nd person makes for creepier as u feel there
and they were... not good
the BEST creepypasta is all 1st person
omygoodness, the scary Pizzapony is here
/me "So where should we go to eat? I don't know about you but I'm starved!" Sweetie Bell rang. "Me too," Applebloom replied, "how about we go to sweet apple acres and have some of my Sis's fritters?"
video game hacks
killer shark, best videogame ever
I miss arcades.
pew pew pew
GOTY ERRY YEAR
killer shark
Worse arcade game ever
Second person forces you to do stuff, it is essentially an order YOU are obligated to fill. In creepypasta, it's "creepyest" (ie not creepy at all) when you are forced to do something rather than have your own say as would be per first person or third person
1. GO TO BEACH
;3
2. PLAY VIDEO GAMES
@Dman...I only WISH it wasn't true that I owned cowboy boots and a ten gallon hat, even if for a joke once.
I once had this arcade that had the Jurassic Park game

Ugh, CYOAs...

this explains why there are no seaponies in g4

10Best, nerdiest cowboy EVAR
8. Make baby sharks
anyone know how long this whole stream is going to be?
I wanna know how long I can push it
The big reason CYOAs end up being so bad is because the plot is a jumbled mess and whether the story continues or not can seem entirely random.
9. Ditch cupcakes and make muffins
yep
Sol: i definitely agree, but i just don't think i've been good enough to convey it in the way i like with my writing style
06try !cmds for more :P

I think I'm gonna miss Black Dynamite *cries*
maybe CYOAs just aren't meant to be a serious genre

just like video games that leave too many choices don't tend to have brilliant stories

I loved CYOA
Bjornfot do you wear a horned helmet at least?

I always skimmed through CYOA for the good ending.

Hm.
speaking of CYOA, has anyone ever read the Super Mario Bros. CYOA?
I think I got a lightning-fast thunderstorm incoming soon.
ReticentSmolder, less talky, more shippy! (and I'm going back to reading Me and Rainbow Dash shipping. silly 2nd person, making Silver mane get sexed for once)
10SilverMane brilliant; nerdy gangsta
i love when the kid got killed
/me The four of them made their way from the town square while talking idly. Sweetie was mentioning her progress in popularity with other singers across Equestria. Scootaloo listened, but couldn't surpress a gag or two at the thought of the romantic lovey-dovey politics between the mares and stallions in the spotlight.

I always took the unintuitive choice in CYOAs, always works out in the end

I remember the Goosebumps CYOA

Oh, I wasn't further expounding on my assertion, DashAttack, I was saying my own opinion of why I think the majority of creepypasta is second person ^^U I'm sorry if I came of as a jerk!

rainbrodash, Silvermane NEVER gets laid. Plenty of near-miss incidents in the last few weeks, but...
I remember one time in a CYOA I got boiled in a pot full of pasta and a noodle was talking to me, it was a goose bumps book.

heh, goosebumps... I guess we really are nerds in here
Sol: nah, it's cool. i think we misunderstood each other. i was just saying in general because i dislike writing in 2nd person XD
Predator? Get to da choppah
did somepony say FRIENSHIP?
I approve of the use of madoka majika
Think they were D&D based. A lot of the monsters that showed up in them were from D&D.
because sharks can hear whistles

/me hears an orchestra.
Shoot the shark, find out it was a kid with a fake shark fin
inb4 Amity is magic.
Like black puddings.
/me "That's really cool Sweetie bell, anyway PizzaPony, what *I* do is even cooler, I'm a WONDERBOLT." She proclaimed with a thump her hoof on the lightning bolt on her chest.
I guess you could say Brody's quest is over? Or something?
/me nvm
I prefer blood pudding
However its been ages since I read that book series
SWIM GODDARNIT, DON'T STAND IN A SINGLE SPOT
10SilverMane isn't the only person in that exact position, feels bad pony

STAY CALM! ALL IS WELL!
(and now here comes the human stampede)
Can I have a link to the Silvermane stories? If they are available.
1/2 of the people were trampled to death
hey sivermane, this RD fic
Actually trying to fight the black pudding in this one CYOA resulted in your character turning into an idiot with no peripheral vision.
this fic contains the line' twitching, erect wings'
I... don't want to live ont his planet anymore
heh
Everyone Panic, its the best thing to do!
oh hello there, Mr. Mayor. smile, you're on TV
... in fact, fighting damn near anything in that CYOA was a dumb idea. Usually it would kill you in one page.
FKING TROLLS
DSNesmith you know you like it.
trolololol
i still sorta want to do it
fight anything = death, it always does that
Shoot them anyway.

Pinkie's holding that can to the side of her face, not her ear.

YEAAAHHHHH
Who is that pony with the mustache and glasses?
What a thrill...
@RainBroDash also, SilverMane is a pegasus in OC canon, but DSNesmith retcon'd it to be like PizzaPony, so I'm going to roll with him being a unicorn and maybe mentioning that he had been a pegasus before the accident
Huh? what was that noise!
It can be troublesome. I was living on my own for a while, but then real life nipped me in the butt
!
!
I'm STILL IN A DREAM PONY EATER
10ReticentSmolder it's cool, i can dig it
inb4 SilverMane is actually an engineering major, but his pegasus is a psych major
6I was living on my own for close to a year...
waiit for it...
i guess rarity washed her hair
prepare your !
So, I'm still staying with parents until I can actually get a career going
6Only time since I was 13 that I didn't sleep on a couch.

I'M STILL CLIMBING THIS LADDER SNAKE EAAAAATERRR
10ReticentSmolder i'd seen the silvermane pegasus picture already :L
suddenly Pinkie Pie turns into Spongebob
Unsurprising that I haven't lived on my own before.

Apple Jack lets RBD into the barn, but NOT PINKIE PIE
EEEYUP

angry Pinkie is angry
Pinkie Pie used Soul Stare! It's super effective!
10Love -you-, Ghosties? Eww.
well, she does talk about renovating the barn...
dat okie dokie lokie
6I've always thought of it as being young until you hit about 35, then you're a little old, then 50 is old.
Yeah Applejack we all know you like Goat porn
*GASP*
4Thanks for the love, Dashite, but I must decline the offer >_>
8!
Applejack is so bad at lying that even half-truths are unconvincing.
okie dokie loki
I thought his name was Goatees, not Ghosties
Big Pie is watching you
But... but you said... :(
/me Applebloom, while obviously confused at the entire idea of time travel, saw that SilverMane was telling the truth. "Okay, I kinda get it an I kinda don't. You must be pretty shook up if you've been time traveling in the whoositwhatsits, so what are you gonna do now?"
but you could see party preparations are renovations...
What is a pony? A miserable pile of secrets and lies!
Gummy stares deeply into the voids of SPAAAAACCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
Okay...
Not me. 30 was old when I was a teenager
/me turns and walks sadly away, head down...
>nice spread
NICE SPREAD
6...where does Pinkie get those jewels...
Dat eyebrow.
4PizzaPony has been gravely misinformed as to what my name is
stole em from rarity?
I love talking
Stole them from Rarity
Pinky: Professional interogator
Jewels are semi like candy in equestria
moar like sex talk
SirSprinkles: They're the remaining possessions of some ponies that maybe went...missing.
Now I'm 23
10Dashite there's always an RBD shoulder to cry on
Detective Pinkie
She must have stolen the jewels from Rarity
/me giggles at goatees
10(except for you Ghosties. No.)
And 7 years doesn't seem old anymore
pinrce-dari: OH GOD, WHY
dari, can you do that text file now?
good cop, bad Pinkie
i can't spell
Pinkie Pie, ace detective
Giggle at the Goatse
Thanks For Tuning in!
:D
She's Pinkie Pie, she ain't gotta explain shit.
Eeyup.
7 hour bath
guffaw at the tubgirl
MidnightStar: I'm giggling right now.
Lookin' good, Spike.
it done broked... the whol thing... :_:
4Well, I would HOPE I know what my own name is
Disturbing.
/me SilverMane thought for a bit about this. His house was probably sold...or foreclosed for that matter. "I have no place to go, most of my friends and family lived out of town and haven't seen me in years, I doubt they would even recognize me now if they thought I was still alive."
SPIKE
How does Gummy hold onto Spike's tail without teeth?
I confess!
*facepalm* oh gosh Spike
Pinkie inquisition
Don't feel bad, Goatees. I'll always be here for you, despite how RainbroDash treats you
Only bad Pinkie, nothing good remains.
SPAIK
aww, poor Spike
SPIKE YOU FAIL AT BEING INTERROGATION
Spike abuse.
Pinkie insanity...now

And suddenly Pinkie died
4If my name was Goatees, does that mean I'd get my own brand name cereal?
FOREVER A STONE
OH NOSE
6btw, this is me over the past 6 months
I'm never going to be able to look at Ghosties the same way...
that is what inspired cupcakes
Your name is Goatse
ok...I am taking back that aww!
Great job Spike
Dat background music. *shudders*
Poor SirSprinkles
A mad tea party
<.>
oui, zat is correct, madam!
*twitch*
Midnightstar! Don't make fun of Goatees like that!
/me Sweetie Bell looked like she was on the verge of tears as SilverMane continued. "I know this might sound like a big request, but do you know anypony I can stay with until I figure out what the hay is going on?"
/me 7hugges SirSprinkles
space space space
12:3
MISTER TURNIP
the twitch scares me the most.

06When I can feel the itch, then it's bad D:
I also live alone :<
Madame Le Flour is a cannibal
/me hides
@RainBroDash you still getting this?
mr. turnips>rainbow dash
So what are those twitches anyways about?
Cupcakes actually came before this episode.
notice one is missing.
Rocky from the rock farm?
I want a Mr Turnip plushie
OH FU-

This is like my room btw

A waaaaaaaaaaaat?
Dumori like mine too : )
only 4 fake friends.
this episode was already written before cupcakes
10ReticentSmolder loud and clear
06o3o?
way before cupcakes
Rocky x Philomena is canon
06x3
losers was censored in canada
@RainBroDash awesome...awesome to the max
06aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaEspeon plush
where are the Ponies with the white jackets when you need them
Flour hitler
sirsprinkles you have accepted a fallacy : O
oh pleas bjornfot
hey, remember Party of Two? Rocky x Madame Leflour?
Done Hip.
8>friends dont come to a party
Saved into drafts.
6Dman, I have accepted the truth about my life.
Rocky x The hydra is what's real.
8>never speak to them again
Madame LeFlour needs to be a recurring character
derpy pinkie
Elky: Yes, but Cupcakes was written before the episode was public, so neither one inspired the other.
SirSprinkles cheer up!
: D
true
Awkward.
Yo whaddup
Combustiblelemons try acting out a bigger party solo you get tired way to quick
4RAPE HER
MFW I attached the text file instead of just pasting the list into the body of the email.
what is wrong SirSprinkles? I love you, does that help any?
O_o
inb4 covert flank enjoyment
I thought the L word was Lesbian, not Losers.
/me After just a short wait, the humble PizzaPony was enjoying his pizza. His lips were coated with warm melty RainBro goo mixed with special sauce. The night drifted away as he lost himself in his own custom pizza. No weirdos, no peanut butter, no... hole punching pizzas. Just him, and his soft dough.
Welcome to the Twilight Zone, Rainbow.
RD came to bring Pinkie Pie her pills.
Cupcakes Pinkie is rather different from PoO Pinkie anyway
Poor Rainbow
6Dman, you have no idea just how shitty my life is right now... cheerful is not something I can pull off. Best I can do is apathy.

Wing boner
Pinkie Pie's delusions are so strong, even Dash gets pulled in.
>murder rockpile
How dare you hit Rocky! *hiss*
12SS
10Axel_Foaley the REAL L word is 'lesbians'
>grab cake
ha.
why is Rainbow Dash sporting a wingboner the whole time?
>acquire Pinkie
/me is done with his story.
>win forever
SHE KILLED ROCKY
I wonder if Rocky will return for a rematch with Dash.
Facesit
12this remix makes me think of a whack-a-mole o-o
i think cupcakes is inspired to the episode whit gilda
I'm in lesbians with you
Dash is so omnisexual even a bucket of turnips gives her a wingboner.
ponyshrug.jpg
no wingboner there though
Hipster_Brony wins AAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLL THE FUCKING CAKE
XD
Nice hat, Dash.
10Razyn that was.. majestic.
Wing boner there though
Hard way. *Snicker*

lmfao
Surprise!
10I'll pastebin it now if you wish
also my SoT remix was a tutorial remix for a friend of mine
XD
IT'S A HAT CELEBRATION.
Razyn ty bro
CHUMP
dash has had a wingboner for longer than 4 hours
/me Another silence fell across the room as the reality of the situation bore down on them. SilverMane was a wayward pony now, had nopony to turn to for help, and he didn't even ask for theirs, only that they point him in the right direction. Sweetie Bell, now overcome with her emotions all but burst, "I'm sure we can find somewhere for you to stay."
Dam farewell parties, they always suck
epic music here
Falcon Kick!
They just can't handle the emotional trauma.
Hat party? I didn't know they had TF2 in equestria!
Thanks, RBD, Dman. Yeah I'd love that link.
Rainbow Dash needs pills to get wingboners
A FAREWELL TO PINKIE PIE PARTY
Gravity? What's that?
Dat physics
My farewell party wasn't so decorated. :(
THAT'S WHY
Also I got beat up
Lying is awesome when you get a party out of it.
I'd really expect Rarity to have a classier partyhat
8DOFGNDFB FGNPWFBV JGNWL
Nuh-uh

SPIKE LIED!
Pinkie is re-inflated
It doesn't say that.
mfw Dash falls up
dat respawn timer...
Pinkie's pills went into effect.
Spike just troll'd Pinkie
>live in sugarcube corner
It's the language of the Necronomicon that's written on the cake.
Twilight lied.
Pinkie is illiterate anyway
Dash, don't be silly.
D:
PINKIE PIE pony is best pony
>have no idea about a cake
turnips is my favorite pony
You were replaced by a stack of rocks.
Twilight has averted bad end
Also, this jam is awesome.
Dat dance
so Twi just scribbled insults on the cake
THIS GODDAMN MUSIC
flap flap flap
ROCKY IS THE BEST PONY
/me "Ah know, how about you use the guest room at Scoot's place? She's always dreamt of having Rainbow Dash mov-," "That's enough Applebloom, hehe, um I mean, of course you can stay SilverMane, we can head there right now if you want."
Pinkie Pie fhtagn

wtf is Across the Universe and why do i want to throw up just from a look at the cover art at imdb?
wtf
;)
/me started at episode one because someone linked it. It was beautiful. And then this happened.
In my defense I wanted to choose Road Warrior but the mods said it was B movie, but a Beatles rendition of Vietnam is pretty damn awesome
Dari, you misspelled Back To The Future back there. You know, when you were talking about the best movie.
MODS BE TAKIN OUR JERBS
10@sol, lol'd

,___,
[O.o]
/)__)
/me sits and waits for eventual B movie selection
8razyn: jaws is sci fi?
RainBroDash, did I get that pastebin? I can't tell.
lol
best movie picking was a troll?
TO ALL HERE, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE GOT A METASCORE OF 56/100
AoD, that is
mods are cheating... I don't know how, but I will find out eventually...
DENIED DMAN!
Razyn: We haven't watched BttF yet. :P
i would have chosen pulp fiction for a and super mario bros for b
we will watch Mortal Kombat someday
if i had missed the chance to pick a B movie i'd be pissed
/me screams MORE SHIPPING NAOW
6After this ep is over we will...
Dashite - never dinished so no u : P
wow, inb4 hate for Across The Universe, you guys wanted to see Up so bad
LUCKILY IT IS THE LAST MOVIE OF THE NIGHT
So cute.
4Up is a good movie
Twilight is so freakin' adorkable.
/me Applebloom was struggling to breathe through the hoof of her friend and gave a slight sigh of relief when Scootaloo removed it to tug on SilverMane's hoof in the direction of the door.
6um
UMAD spike?
Not finishing still counts!
One of these days, we're watching Downfall..
mfw everypony here wants to pick B movie
10Razyn, pastebin is here: http://pastebin.com/6b6RQ85t
6Guys, I'm going to put up the discussion thread now that we have the schedule.
I would have chosewn Pulp Fiction offor A and Day of the Dead (the old one) for B
dg
interior_gummy: we already watched super mario bros
6please tell me that's not a script
My little colorful equine
12it is
10...lmao
6>.>
4And I expected so much more from you, reticent. Being a damn cowboy and all that
"Up" is a little less sappier.
oh yeah
The best part about Up was the pills.
that is Evil Dead III?
@RainBroDash let the record show that I was going to choose Road Warrior
STILL NO THE WICKERMAN.... WHAT THE HELL?
The old guy was gunna kill himself for sure.
spell #26, turn Spike into a squirrel
I like where this is going
Someone seriously needs to pick He-Man: Masters of the Universe for B movie at some point.
DMAN, POSTPONE PLAN ALPHA, RENAMED PROJECT ALPHA TO NEXT WEEK
ghosties, you could have chosen a clint eastwood movie! why not?
quick someone get drf

a musical pretty much is instant b movie material though
12Roara apparently got stabbed with tyops
Yes, but where would I post it? Just throw a paste bin link at you guys next week?
inbred unicorns

Woot! It was awesome Razyn
Elky: WHat about the Phantom of the Opera?

Guess I know what I'd pick, then.
MASQUERADE!!!!
8dari, why arent you drinking?

10ReticentSmolder I'm gonna pm you in a sec, look out for it
6anyways, he's made it very clear the face bothers him, and it seems like people are attempting to make him as bothered as possible
06:3
GLUG

8lol rezo-chan
derma: I mean in this stream
RainBroDash, do you facebook?

12isn't that what he's been saying, Roara?
7Well, not apparently.
06if you want :/
Elky: I know.
Oh God.
Musicals EXCEPT Rocky Horror.

8RD speaks the truth
a musical is bound to be made fun of...
6yes LL
The great and powerful trixie should get together with tony the tiger
What are the movies and epis?
Elky: there's a movie version of the broadway play.
6tbh I see no point in the script anyways, but I'm not in a position to say get rid of it
They're GRRREAT!
Rainbow Dash pony is always best pony
8NEIGHSAYERS

06ok, if one of my scripts is offending/not wanted, just say so, then i'll take care of it
Look guys, I froze...I wanted to pick the B movie and I had a *really* good idea of what I wanted for it, my mind hit a wall when A movie popped up and I picked what I had been joking about earlier.
twighlight is spike then.
10PizzaPony yep, but only for IRL business. you can have my facebook if you'd like though. but the condition is no blatant public ponies on my wall xD
06lol that's a totally retarded script right there tbh
I SHOWED OFF YOUR MO- Sorry.
06that's all I'll say about it
The entire conflict started up solely because Twilight's friends didn't like Trixie's boasting.
My stream is skipping.
The eighth time I've seen this episode this week
Silly ponies.
too much purple
06thats why i'm called RETARD_ONE

12Espe, you said little but showed more malice
Trixie is God?
06for once I'm being super cereal here
RainBroDash, do not worry, my FB is IRL as well, although I do talk ponies. I don't link to people like that though
No wonder how the Milky Way was born.

Trixie* HAND Y U NO TYPE WELL?!
Trixie is hottest, but that's because I have a thing for her hair color/style/behavior
Ghosties and Trixie have one thing in common.
Twilight and her friends befriended a goddess turned evil, saving her and Equestria from herself.
