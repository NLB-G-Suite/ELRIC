Except for the whole thing where Rose nearly destroyed the universe by saving her father, that kind of supports the idea that it's supposed to be a linear progression, otherwise it wouldn't have nearly destroyed everything.

why would his name be blue
Stargate is awesome. A friend of mine is making his way through the entire series for the first name.

windowception
not really
It really depends
AWESOME
But yeah
Opera sucks in some aspects
I wanna drop a penny down the hole
It's not anything like the matrix to be honest.
They add too many features few people need
And it's a pretty good film.
:P
And they don't seem to pay enough attention to things that need to be attended to
It's all weird.
Like colour profiles
My Wing-Wang.
Matrix really isn't that complicated and the acting isn't fantastic
Keanu is awesome.
*ignoring sequels*
HOW'D IT GET BURNED

Keanu is sad.
Opera's?
oh okay we're talking about Inception

If I saw Inception on TV I'd probably think meh.

Since I'd already seen it and once you've seen it I don't think there's much rewatch value.

I didn't see anything wrong with his acting in the Matrix.

Everyone was a little stiff in the matrix
Whatever.
You guys have weird opinions.
his acting is fine I guess
And Matrix not being great which it clearly is. :P

Lots of companies around here own competing brands. They tend to use them in different markets.

On the other hand we also have Future Shop/Best Buy which can at times be found literally right across the road from each other.
Well I know Waitrose is owned by Walmart, I'm fairly sure that's the only one though.
I've not heard of any others being owned by Walmart too.
>MFW Target is getting exclusive rights to both two different Pinkie Pies and the Luna toys and I've never even seen a Target. :(

Minnet: What's the time in AEST?
Hmmm. oO
You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, Darling. *pulls_grenade_launcher_out*
YES YES
ow
I just realised
they made it ambiguous to make it seem like they were being cool and artsy
to "seem"?
she just sees A"EST" and thinks EST.
8agreed
I'd hate to see it out of control.
well then he certainly failed to impress me with that movie :P
@Dman, I thought he was still dreaming at the end when I saw it the first time
but upon rewatches
I've concluded he woke up to reality
lol
I was half expecting him to get shot in reality and wake up to Mal
I've heard some really crazy theories though
Dman: it can be interpreted as a dream or as reality, since the spinner seems to fall.
by Mal
and he orchestrates the entire plot
Minnet: reload time functions
Minnet: reload commands
it was very convoluted I don't remember all the details
Minnet: what's the time AEST?
:>
it deserves ANOTHER rewatch : P
and then of course there's the purgatory theory
you were right and I guessed right.
that one is silly though
Dman: in the other dreams it doesn't wobble at all.
Great Mouse Detective
That's the whole point of the spinner.
the way a totem works
is that it has different phsyics than normal objects
:<
yea
To make it unique to the holder of the totem, I get that.
but person woh it belongs to knows
if it acts oddly, you're not in someone else's dream
yes
wut
LU, TUNE IN NAO
http://radionintendo.com/listen.m3u ;D
no joke
The problem is that Cobb's totem, everybody knows that it does. Which is to spin and topple.
Oh i didn't make it in time >_
lol seen it bfore dsnesmiht
>_>
but anyway
totems
06already?!
06one hour early!
let's use the chess piece as an example
I don't even remember the mouse being hot in that movie.
Ariadne mods the chess piece to always fall one way, and to not roll
but only she knows the proper weight
quite
she doesn't actually have her totem
7red orwhite?
she has that person's image of her totem
not hers or reality's
6FUKKEN ARISTOCATS
instead of her special modded one
7wine ;)
yes
for another example, Arthur's die
Isn't it easy to gauge the weight of something?
because the dreamer doesn't know it's loaded
that's the thing, Axel
Oh right me! Sorry Sathi, I meant I was enjoying DSNesmith's talk
BUT
they're specially weighted
to be AGAINST expectations
okay and this is the weird one
the top
IMDB is such a good place to find movie quotes.
the reason it never falls
7good choice ;)
is because the dreamer doesn't know the weight of the top
An Architect can make everything except carpet convincing to the brain.
very good dman
7red of course
also, obligatory: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmHAqgAFt6E
I could find movie trivia if anyone wants ^_^
yeah I did research on this :P
6Duh.
yes
I'm still running on dialup.
okay here's a crazy one for all of you
the kicks back up the levels
i have like 4 bluray movies only, and Inceptions one of them
the way that saito's aging works out
he should be old in the intro too, right
he's down in limbo with mal, fischer, and ariadne
listening
Hello brownies
he kills mal
but she stabs him
the kick comes
um whats this?
Ariadne takes Fischer back up
the hospital explodes
yes
yea
alright, showertime
cyall in about 20 minutes.
damn what's his name
anyway
they all wake up
I too should shower soon
but this is the neat part
kk Xeli
that level ceases to exist
because no one is awake in it
hmm yes
. . . . FUCK
level 2 disappears
level one
>is on /oat/
they all get outside of it except cobb
cobb bleeds out in limbo
yea
he shoots back up to level 1
6I know.
but lvl2 and 3?
6But it got like, no replies. =/
2 and 3 don't exist anymore
no one awake in them
There are four levels, though.
inception?
limbo is a variable level
Top level which is the city. Second level is the hotel, third level is the hospital, and fourth is Limbo.
threads like that usually dont
and died on level 2
they'd have gone to limbo
He should've used a toenail clipper as his totem.
if they made 14
and died
they'd go to limbo at lvl 15
and died on lvl 14 yea
also this song fucking rocks
yeah it does
Watching Mulan just for this scene. everyone does this.
Mulan was actually a good movie
very good
the thread on Oat
i have VHS and DVD : )
I never watched it
D:
and it came after the atrocious pochohauntus and hunchback
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/36267469.html
/me bops zitloid on the head
nicely
Frollo was great, but the rest of HoND was terrible
4 layer didn't collapse
hunchback was good
Hunchback was pretty ok, not atrocious
but isn't their show weekly?
all very interesting
Guys i'm gonna go eat and shower should be back before show!
and then limbo ceased to exist per se
7Enjoy dman!
7See you in a bit
Isn't that a bit of preferential? I mean, it's no different from our thread....
I still don't get how he went from the billionaire son's dream to saito's dream.
Thank you Sathi see ya in a while
was because cobb had been there before
everyone
6Their threads get stickied right before their shows...
limbo is the collective unconcious
it's kinda Jungian
they're all linked through the machine
and they share dreamspace
limbo doesn't have a dedicated dreamer
6Yeah, but it might be because their threads are put up like, a couple hours before thier shows and taken down after their show ends.
6Whereas ours are up all week.
whoever's inside it, is dreaming
not the selection thread.
is this the micheal bolton version?
or the good one
lol
6Well, we don't do Selection Threads anymore anyway...
i have actually asked on /meta/ that threads like that not get stickied
sigh
I loved this movie
I still do
plus, Hades
also, for future pre-shows: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1GRj6CNSGg
oh, cool.
lol
is my hair out?
the list probably goes
Frollo>Hades>Scar>Everyone else
because that needs to happen
6Well, yeah.
6Maybe post-show.
6Frollo is hilarious.
6Hello Reticent.
orly?

another villain I liked
she's...entrancing 0.0
was actually from the recent movie
SO...christmas in July special, eh?

I saw Wicker Man in theatres thinking it was a different movie (I had no internet)
I know a movie worse than Spider's Web
I know several actually
but the worst
Night Train to Mundo Fine
You found something worse than Spider's Web?
Smolder: It was Twilight, wasn't it?
~~~~
6We only aired an A movie that week.
Yes it exists.
;o
... do it
well at least you get to hear my show in full today :3
The only other week we did that was week 1 and I wasn't there.
Rules 1 and 2 of BMN
6Yes, DSN.
yeah
Oh gods, this song.
OH THIS
OH HECK YEAHJ
I *LOVED* this show as a kid

DEEK
I wanna be

has anyone ever beaten IWBTG
12~~~~~
Sadly no.
Never played it.
I can't get to Mecha Birdo
YES
I only beat half of it. The Metroid section burned me out.
PONY POLKA
I can't ever get past the zombies
12I finished Master Quest :3
yush
the Ghouls and Ghosts area is just awful
the spike tunnel
uuuugh
Lol
and the freaking bats
That spike tunnel is where I left off.
6Reticent, I've streamed it a few times.
good shit eh?
6NO LINKS! /obligatory
but IWBTG had the best intro ever
start
move left
/me 12was hoping that would add Ganon(dorf) to the Boss Gauntlet
WHAM SPIKE WALL
12but apparently not :/
6Mousehunt? Probably A...
move down avoid walls
suddenly OTHER WALL
Suddenly, i feel the most appealing urge to give an artistic display regarding the presence of diminutive and youtfhul equines of mine possession, and thus i shall proceed with performing the aforementioned act in a timely and considerable manner, my dearest companions. Diminutive and youtfhul equines of mine possession.
/me 12guesses it's because you can re-fight him naturally
go up instead of down
die to apple
/me just officially woke up. :/
avoid apple
apple falls up and kills you
SIDEWAYS APPLE

I wanted to do other things this Saturday.
Delicious Fruit.
Oversleep is actually a bad habit I have.
I am a good movie finder.
I know quality.
XANADU
xanadu is beyond a musical
other way round. There are tons of excellent a movie choices
O hey what's going on?
>:D
Musicals: the movie version of Phantom of the Opera.
amazing
all the 80s hair
Anybrony here seen Across The Universe?
I have
Gattica was a decent A
Also seconding Repo, I really want to see that here sometime.
Hot Fuzz is my A
2001 is a snorefest
HEY
Gattaca was okay...
Mine too, Axel. :D
DON'T INSULT KUBRICK'S WORK
I can feel it
not saying it wasn't an important film
DSNesmit, I can feel it
but it wasn't an interesting one
any movie requiring a time machine to become accurate is weird (ie 2001 since we're already past it)
Vicky Christina Barcelona might be the A if I'm in a bad mood.
Reticent: hey, that's like saying Blade Runner is weird too. Seeing how it is supposed to happen in 2019
Sex and the City: The first movie to be denied by the mods.
we should watch Star Trek 2
KHAAAAAAAAAAAN
TADAIMA (okaeri~~)
Star Trek 2: Wrath of Trixie.
Cult classics are also good Bs
Would Road Warrior be an A movie?
loool
Really, anything that isn't still relevant/ doesn't have a huge budget

reefer madness... the musical?
Yes
look at that Inky Pie, she dancing awesome
Reefer Madness is fucking hilarious!
poor treasure planet
the movie that killed 2d animation
You shoulda seen her earlier, Silvemane. She was dancing WITH NO MUSIC
Also, I learnt to enjoy Treasure Planet even more after reading Treasure Island.
Sorry guys just a sec mmy dad's on the phone
/me tempporarily leaves
I hated Treasure Planet. Atlantis demolished it as an adventure movie.
But I do still enjoy it
atlantis!
great movie
I loved that one
Reefer Madness is hilarious, watched it 3 or 4 times last Fall
4@ReticentSmolder: I'd like to be shipped without too many handling fees

Hey guys
Axel Foaley: you do know it is a sci-fi view of the treasure planet, right?

well
Silvermane : )
I'd like to pretzel.
hay everypony
did you SAY he wanted a pretzel? no...well yes
10"although it is not a clop-fic" has become a clause in this conversation. I never thought I'd see the day

10@elky ">2nd person" was particularly entertaining
you running live clopfics *again*?
no but really, there's a reason second person is very, very rarely used in fiction
There aren't any ATM, when should I get the list?

Closer to the intermission?

10dman I am, don't you worry

Oh. Right the Fluttixie fic,.
2 minutes flat
even when I am getting killed do nothing
2nd person in fiction can be very interesting if done well
anyone ever read the, uh
uh
uh
the magic of Recluse novels?
tbh, I've never read a good example
OH SHI
... no
DUUUUUUUUUUN DUN
I got... surprised by that.

2nd person is hard to write good in
i try to avoid it
lawl
trololololo pizzapony returns
10>the damage had been done.
oh here coems jeff goldblum moment
10epic line
And now SilverMane = Pizza Pony is canon
oh, uh, uh, this creature, is, uh, a machine
You try to avoid second person, because you find it to be hard.
Maybe Pizza Pony can be luckier this time?
make little sharks
i'm right! not crazy! MUAHAHHAHAHAHAH
it, erm, uh, all it, eh, does, is, eat and make LITTLE SHARKS, um yeah.
*looks at sign* wow, that sign sucks
the national geographic
and make little piece of shit
4Why is that a good majority of creepy pasta is in second person?
second person also has very little payoff compared to the difficulty of writing it
10@ghosties it can make it that bit creepier
hm, maybe
Silvermane we need to go deeper.
it's not familiar territory for me
Choose-Your-Own-Adventure tend to be creepypasta hence the second tense.
ME!
actually, the only published second person I've read are those goosebumps CYOA books
MINDBLOWING GRAPHICS
2nd person makes for creepier as u feel there
and they were... not good
the BEST creepypasta is all 1st person
omygoodness, the scary Pizzapony is here
