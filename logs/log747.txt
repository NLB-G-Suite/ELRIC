also props if you can guess where I heard this first
lol
00,10ok the comments on this are making me choke http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/138msd/agent_dashie_by_wreky/
13choke?
00,02some of these must be doubles
00,0226.7GB
00,02lots of it is in flac
00,02best format
13oh flac
00,02Shizuka, ikr
13meh, flac makes treble hurt
00,02i like flac
13yes i said it :)
Music?
00,02XAX, yeah
00,02as i said, flac
hey Spyrofan
Holla everypony! :)
00,02bunch larger than mp3 but there is a quality difference
13oh :3
00,10aye
Someone found a link to that song in the background of the S3 commercial. GIDDY UP GIDDY UP GIDDY UP UP.
00,02aparently i havent got many doubles
00,10like the show but with work and work I hsve not watched it in ages
it was in my head ALL THE TIME
00,10llame
hey
00,02i've got 2.4GB unlabeled mp3's and other misc things that i need to replace
00,02XAX, o_O
Giddy up up should've been the meme
it's such a catchy tune
Someone made a remix.
Yeah
the extracted version
the extracted wasn't really that great
Nah
Vocals were 2quiet4me
yeah
Haven't listened all the way through...
hay everypony :)
but now that we have the full version
someone needs to remix it
shame only 4chan knows about it
It'll be on EqD eventually...
doubt it
The only brone musicians I know that browse /mlp/ is Yelling at Cats
hey guys
And he does rap, not remixes
Yeah
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353019420254.png I do not believe this
tried it myself
this reminds me
I need to read End of Ponies
lel
f'naaaa
just an author
the one of Background Pony
this is genius:D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNFAsKwCCHw
oh dear
EqD can sometimes be a good site. But the comment section.
sorry net d/c
though don't rely on it for news
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Meghan McCarthy Interviewed on JustUs Geeks

I have about 600 wallpapers ._.
Best part is, they're unsorted.
oh, k
its fine
I can wait
DUN DUN DUUUUUUN
Stream!

Hey
11,01Me and LC have interviewed together before.
wow
Hi everybody :(
k fine
lolxsplittrial
that yes
I dont need chocolate
I mean
00,02D:
00,02who doesnt need chocolate
My chest hurts everytime I breath and It really hurts
00,02Sumica, cant reproduce the problem without a stream
DSAUDHAS
GODDAMIT THIS HURTS
I'M OUT
00,02Sumica, yeah, it doenst happen unless theres a stream
00,02thats my guess anyway
00,10realy?
00,02yeah
00,10hmmm
00,02well it wasnt shoing up
00,02showing'
00,10with no stream
00,02:3
00,02Sumica, bizare
/me scratches head
00,10yep
00,02Sumica, sure
If you can't breath easy and you have chest pains call an ambulance.
heavy*
ya
not enought power to move them
00,02Sumica, yeah, i cant reproduce the issue here
Don't just stand there and dillydally!
0,5Oheyi
*hugs BaconMane*
0,5I'm being attacked!
0,5*ISH BECEN & APPEJEHCK*
But it's jut a hug, BaconMane~ I promise I don't bite
much
0,5Your name is "AttackWithHugs" >>
11,01I actually sound good in this interview.
0,5Is not >>
Yes it is. I randomly hug people, thus the name was created
00,10back in a few, upgrading system memory
0,5Wait a sec
brb
0,5am I in this interview? >>
0,5O: I am
00,02ok, this is anoying
:>
00,02and cant compare correctly
Nah, password is the most secure.
i have the same password on my luggage
you surely know about it
Man, I really wish I could get into Planetside 2. But the client is rejecting my GPU
no
00,02aparnetly not
http://howsecureismypassword.net/ is a pretty good tool for evauluating password security.
00,02Punkie_Pue, 'password security' is a mostly flawed concept
>4 quattuordecillion years
00,02Punkie_Pue, http://xkcd.com/936/
:>
00,02it is MORE SECURE than passwords and does not require any user interaction for authentication
Thats the method i am going to be moving towards
00,02i log into my servers with greater security than my banks website
That's... pretty good.
00,02XAX, it is really easy
Lookin' forward to tomorrow night guys!
00,02its not "ENTER FIVE BAJILION CHARACTER PASSWORDS"
Tomorrow?
OH
wait
00,02its public key crypto
Movie night?
Movie Night!
Plus ponies on Saturday!
/me brohoofs right back /][\
owait
00,02GilDash, the only 'downside' is that you need that file, and cant really remember it
It's an interview. :P
I can't wait for ponies!
I had my volume muted. :P
Who's streaming?
what's this now?
Why does Derpgate come up in every interview?
00,02it never leaves the computer
00,02GilDash, imposible
Well, I'ma leave, see all you fabulous men tomorrow
00,02AlienWarhead, you try break rsa then
:P
i'm back everypony :)
:3
00,02DoctoDoctorWho, well yeah, but they probably have quantum computers which via some math magic they can solve the factorization problem that makes rsa secure, there are other crypto systems being researched that are 'quantum safe' though
please
no
00,02http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography heres an explination
that xsplit watermark
00,02well one time pad is the single exception but it requires a key with as much entropy as the data being sent and the key can only be used once
did i hear my math lab?
00,02point is, public key > passwords
00,02GilDash, start learning then :P
00,02internet is full of information about computers
00,02funny that
00,02GilDash, a suprising ammount if you stay away from news sites
hey now
Faux news is 100% reliable
Excellent security conversation guys, I'll get to public key in a few weeks in my security no hard feelings everypony <3
BYe, MadSurge.:)
thanks guys
Bye everybody. I'm off to play
13Phase4: you're supposed to just have a photographic memory
Isn't walking robots the worst idea ever?
Like- just about every method of movement would be more efficient?
but those complication makes it horrible for machines, right?
11,02We talking about pony robots? o.o
lol yes
Hi :3
11,02Ohai :3/
how ya doin' :3

ok good.

00,10went from 4 gigs memory to 16
Didn't Microsoft's stock go down badly after the release of Win 8?
the sixteen giggers
11,02But...but...
11,02I only have 8 GB of memory O~O
:D

i remember that show
OI!
stripperella was an awesome show XD
how do stripper ponies work? :)
...
00,10pony striping works the other way around
11,02Stripper ponies put on clothes
00,10they put on clothing
xD
Â 
11,01Put it on!
It can be interesting in augmenting though, like the japanese have in elderly-home research

O.O
grounded
someone tell me this is not intimidating
http://ranqit.com/u/d743fa23-63ef-4dc6-9a6d-81c1d4eee081.jpg
It's not
dammit, i need to refresh :D
It's not intimidating. It's frightening.
Honestyl, as a design, I think it looks humorous, but personal preference aside
it's a unwise design choice for anything realistic
It's a statue
it can move its head and shoot non leathal lazers
moving head or not
like in Fallout3 I groaned and deleted it via console
A statue is a statue, moving parts or not
I remember requesting that
and it got in top 10
A statue can move
not first but it got in top 10

so.....beautiful.....:(
Hold up. this about gundam? i'm doing a semester long paper on these.
males use the square brackets
00,10no nitt
11,01OK.
11,01Same people, though.
00,10nope
11,01My bad.
00,10Crusaders is doing CoN
a gundam would take the equivalent of 7 apache engines to operate
O.O
00,10Science time
Oh hot dang
HIM
00,10hoopla
HOOPLA!
00,10you go to the site and make a station account
00,10see on the right side of the home page for planet side
00,02Sumica, done that, thats how i got to account creation
http://www.myninjaplease.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/lw3.jpg
http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/ne/p/2004/NeoMecha2_500x667.jpg
00,02Punkie_Pue, it may be totaly legit, thing is it fundamentally against how passwords are suposed to work
Everything can be destroyed, and the more parts, the more oppertunities
Bye!
Bajbaj
yes I said -12%
http://www.myninjaplease.com/?p=3936
00,02Sumica, i think it broke, says the code is already activated
Mechs are already being built
00,02"We're sorry, the Code you have entered has already been redeemed or has expired"
And the more parts you have in something, the more likely it is to fail, anything mechy has too many parts to be a GOOD design in warfare or industry
00,02Sumica, that works too
00,10you should already be in it if you used the key
00,10if it bitches I still have 3 more codes
00,10you can have another one
00,10this coper wire, remionds me of a raceicst joke
I just think mech would be a horrible idea in anything except movies or shows- how much more money does it cost to amke it work compared to something more solid and structurally sound?
the stream interupting for you guys as well?
approx 725,000,000
00,10hell of a machine
cost to build
^
11,01Anyone else getting intermittent buffer?
It's madness! It's...IT!
we have designed robots that get up when knocked over, on their own.
yes
Night: a bit
00,10.......that seems deadly
lol
00,10hmmmm?
G'night everypony! :)
/me wiki's
Its 20% cooler than steel
00,10I restarted it
it's not stronger
Deja Vu
I like this show
hmm I hate my laptop
00,10kinda amazing how much work is still done by hand
It is as (equally) strong as some(not all) steels
00,10they choose to make it by hand
00,10i was refering to some jobs that cant be done by machine
00,10it needs room to uncompress data
bigger problem than being destroyed; how's it gonna walk without destroying the ground under it?
00,02Sumica, ... its 2012, i can decompress things progressively with tools written in the 80s, this is unreasonable
We said the same about moonbases in in 1969
00,02but whatever, i'll find a spare gigabyte somwhere
00,10all karge envioment games do that still
ever-
00,10wow takes 40 gigs to install but only uses 20 gigs on disk
but, I've been wrong before
00,02wish they would stop doing that
00,02its incredibly anoying and even more lazy
00,10aye me too
I plan on making those breakthroughs.
The deadlier weapons are smaller, faster, and simpler.
00,02plus its gona cause disk fragmentation like theres no tomorow
00,10yep
00,10tis why I run defraggler alot
00,02urgh, i'll just disable the hiberfile
My computer defrags automatically-
How Scoot's Made
00,10I dont like auto functions cause my sleep schudle
Tanks aren't a good design anymore, in modern wars
The only exoskeleton I know banned military from looking at it
00,10I could not run it till I got defraggler
brb all
Spend extra resources, extre time, extra skill and complication solving, on somethign that would give worse results than a practical, smaller design
00,10just because the desgine is bad dont meen it wont end up on the battle field
00,10just look at the bradily fighting vheical
No- but I think it's unlikely, because of money and engineering
that's a good thing in my book
00,10nice montoage here
:P
though- that might be a joke
I never want to build something that would use passwords- too much responsobility
I'm not a cynic though
ok it is how it's hade cool
lol...I've actually used "correcthorsebatterystaple" as a password (briefly) for one of my programs XD
00,10wrong ep
FUCK YEAH
GUNDAM all the way
jking of course.
cool eyed
00,02and produce bugger all thrust
Is it wise to use dictionary words for a password?
dun dun duun
Is it wise to use dictionary words in password?
I use multilangue and made up words sentences as passwords
00,10all this talk of passwords is making me want to play uplink
going
Sadly, I don't- I'm far mor interested in animals and such than tech
not to brag or anything...
Hmm...be back soon guys. Gonna try out this LiveCD I just burnt.
00,10dat pinkie VA
That the same voice actresS?
00,10yes
Bye
that girl in the elivator looking thing that was pinkie
00,10the one with the twin drill hair is the same VA as pinkie
cool
00,02CrystalPhoenix, if that were 25 random characters it'd have an entropy of ~ 118 bits, but its much easier to remember words
00,10yeah but I never remember the names
http://www.derpibooru.org/153339
Yeah names aren't my strongpoint either >.>
If one uses dictionary words, how much does that weaken it?
Whats playing?
13significantly
passwords
oh
00,0244 bits is enough to be safe unless the password hashes are stolen, even then you're still looking at a fair ammount of time to crack
Hey guys. Hey guys listen. My na'es Chef Vordivask now. Alright cool? Alright cool.

*name's
Bye jage..
00,02Kinixys, too slow :P
No problem. I'll say bye next time I see em.
So- passwords are stored and checked like a checksum?
Wait... no... oh well.
I TOLD you guys that my name is now Chef Vordivask. And you didn't believe me.
I just got here whats playing?
Oh Gundum
00,02Vivix, cryptographic hash
Why is it not in English Sub?
I've seen sites use cleartext--horrible
Apparently- if I want to study zoology, I have to go 3 years of Biology
I think biology is gross-
00,02and not exibit colisions
00,02they're terribly inacurate usually
00,02comprimised
00,02'
yeah
ok well I'm going to go play some Assassins Creed 3 now. Bye everyone
I mean, when a site tells me "We've bee compromised" I change all my password sets, despite using different passwords pretty much everywhere
Ha'
That would be worth seeing
Norwegian zoological association website. "What is zoologi?" directs you to a page that says "What"
TA DA! Kiss me!
O.o

I don't get it.
PLOT TWIST!
it is a bad translation. it was "clueless" not KY
08,01what are you guys watching?
I don't know
Saturn some crazy anime
Saturn: Nichijou, craziness Japanaese humour
Saturn: *nods furiously*
still hopped up on caffine Saturn?
08,01Deacon: a bit
Wtf
BOOM! ... awww
Android Bloom is her rival.
not the little toe!
O.o

Saturn: Not even close. XD

if it was, it would be more raunchy
This is weird.
Dah fuq is dis shi?
08,01why does she have a key in her back?
Toe Missile go
ponies and anime! everything a boy needs!
Looks like it's about some clockwork girl?
08,01okay, too weird, i'm bailing out
SAME SAME
Saturn: THAT'S TOO WEIRD for you!?
I feel this anime raises more questions than it answers.
Only in japan. I'm going.
Actually, I'd say that Saturn was at least somewhat close. They're both based on popular 4-panel comics, and follow a very similar animation style and episode format.
Toe Missiles; only in Japan.
Wait, robots can't go to school?
Challenge accepted

i saw it in a commercial
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMqWJSQ1Ot8
That commercial was creepy
I don't think that was necessary...
05too bad
Well stff happens
11,02Ponies really need to read our rules...
^
05sometiems i wish i wasnt a mod
wait you have to do that?
He doesn't, but I don't think he thought it through
11,02Well...how else are we going to know if they're spoilers unless we prove they are?
11,02'Pinkie Pie is best pony!'
Even joke spoilers aren't allowed.
11,02Time to do some research on this....
aww man i'm sorry
I don't even like joke spoilers.
05if you say somethign that may be a sppoiler
05and you dont say it in a "i think" matter
05then you just screwed yourself over
Wow
Good thing I don't come here that often
05always
Ok.
05but dont think I look kindly on scrub spoilign it for otehr people
I can understand that.

Rain: Its a conspiracy
05that bully needs an axe to the balls
13^
You're being framed
^^^
Best answer ever
Not an effective way of killing someone, but painful enough
xD
Where are you gonna get an axe at a school?
13wrek's answer to everything is axe, it works :3
05HoodyNinja: i alwasy cary one around
05J_E_Smith71 i dont watch the live eps

05HoodyNinja: why would we need security?
05pfft
05if people were like me
well gta was fun
:>
05there'd be world peace
Yes the best thing ever. I got kicked but it was worth it to know
Raising awareness is the least you can do to stop the murderous bullies.
Everyone would need a security gaurds
05casue there wouldnt be idiots provoking me/us
Everyone would be fighting, too.
war?
You don't intimidate yourself
unless you are fluttershy
dammit Rain
Thats an explosion waiting to happen
am nthe easyest and best #1 of cavilian self defence is being supper conspicuous
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?
05but really
yes you cna eat conspicuous
05schools over here dotn have security
05they dont need it
mine didnt
Mine does
05specifically after 9th grade
No one acts up though, security is just a nussiance
i wish i had goten bullied at school -3-
no you dont
I don't ever see bullying anymore
Wish? .-.
it would have been fun
Never hoid of it

I try to make it happier
00,10kept a peice of tunned aluminim barstock in a hidden sleeve on my backpack
but people like to sweep things under the rug
05i lucked out on the bully department
05i was stronger but not as fast as the soccer faggots
I have never seen actual bullying
11,02faggots isn't a nice term :(
You really don't.
05SuperBrony64: and i dont use it often
apparently
11,02Still, people shouldn't use it in that context :/
I got bullied by a girl once. it wasn't fun
BULLIED or picked on
There is a huge difference
okay
11,02You should use 'faggot' when referring to the literal defintion which is a bundle of something.
11,02Like sticks.
Isn't it also about ciggerates?
I thought it was a bundle of twigs?
11,02definition*
also kindleing
11,02[Alpha]: Can be used for that, but it's not limited to just twigs.
It's also a ball of chopped meat and liver mixed with bread and herbs, eaten fried or baked in the UK.
Ahh, the beauty/horrors of English denotative and connotative meanings...
11,02Outside of the negative use that is...
05all in all
05few isntances i warrant demeaning tersm
L2P FAG<--- Like that?
05is those 7 back in those ages
Also, isn't fag slang for cigarette as well?
it is
I meant you didn't like it used like that...
My bad

I need some breakfast
If it doesn't though, I'll have to wait (hopefully) until monday.
Aww yeah! We can play some Spartan Ops next week! ^_^
The point system, classes, and armor are a bit much to me.
I was wondering if there were going to be people with that opinion
eh only thing i dont like is no presicion control in Forge
I don't know, he hasn't told us if he got it
Maybe he is cranking it out right now?
Or he's still asleep.
I pretty much stopped PvP at Halo 3
Played the campaigns for the other games after that
drunk people
YAAAAAY
Armour affects gameplay?
wooot
Wow...
LOL
armor does NOT affect gameplay
Hmm
>Halo >Armour makes you stronger
Dohoho
No.
armour variations*
Perhaps its the classes.
:D
when you rank up you get spartan points that you unlock weapons and armor abilities, tactical/Support uppgrades with
JAAYYYYSSSSONNNN
not that much its just custom loadouts there are always fully kitted loadouts available
:D
Nor am I o:
How are we gonna get our Twinkies?!?!
hmm gess they skipped it
Unfortunately yes :'(
I have Got to look this up tho D:

Sandy took away my colors :'(
Now imagine they were edible...
America was still good before Twinkies. Not that the Twinkies were a bad thing, though.
That's disgusting.

The best parts of socks? Taking them off-- aaahh delicious
08,01Everlasting_Joy: hopefully

08,01Wrek: i got a glimpse of it earlier, but it was too NSFW to view in the lab
It's my space....you can't have it.

aaaw really? we glad i got it when i did :D
08,01i've known her for about 5 years
Saturn, awesooooome.
08,01i think we may have slept together
O_o
I don't think it was, at least
brb
there's something going on at tumblr
*that
because of their tagging system, tagging something nsfw doesn't really work
08,01huh
at least, that's th reasoning I heard
JJ yeah
05tumblr doesnt allow overly sexual tumblrs
05it was a matter of time
^
08,01but it wasn't overly sexual... well, not explicitly sexual
05Saturn: i recall the darign do's were?
05neither did I
It's not explicit, but it is sexual
Saturn It was more joking around then anything.
05i didnt midn it at all
05but still
It wasn't as explicit as some other tumblrs
I don't know tumblrs rules
05you cant really be suprised
other tumblrs vanish every day
05at it
Inb4 10000+ fans hatebombs tumbler
Maybe enough people complained about it, illegitametly or not.
Perverted, yes, Sexual, no, not even close.
That's enough to get you blocked by a sfw rule
why did I get kicked oO
05Vordox: i KNOW
05but really
05its tumblr
hey
no, tumblr has been doing cleanouts for a while
05how very paranoid of you
perverted is inheritly sexual
It is highly likely there is a group of individuals reporting NSFW blogs.
even if it is humour and not pornographic, it is nsfw
"Omg I saw a chair that looked like a dildo! OMG CLOASE THAT SEX STORRREE" <--- This happens trust me. :P
I've seen Doxy go down, Smitty and some others.
They should do it on another blog-service that allows their material
whining about this is just silly
Sure, PM me.
(not that you are whining, but some artists were)

NSFW is allowed if it is flagged
05sad to see him loose ald the messages and followers
05but its not that hard to mkae another tumblr
calmy*
05again
I saw Rainbow Dash on hot topic's hot minute
I'm sure there's lot of NSFW tumblrs out there but it seems the pony ones are the ones being taken down
I think more are being, but I'm not sure
Then again, I haven't really kept up with a lot of them so...*shrug*
Or they could have gotten JJ's info somehow and told Tumblr to delete the blog
Rainbow Dash is on Hot Topic's Hot Minute
hehehe
HECK, even that contest they just had was GREAT fun with no perversion
I liked those. They were awesome.
Well, if the blog was tagged as NSFW in the settings, this shouldn't ahve happened, but contests can get you delted as-well
"Unauthorized contests, sweepstakes" etc
There was no actual prize except recognition though.
Well, that I know of.
I don't think there was a price either
Welp, time to torrent it

Let's see, I have uTorrent, mIRC, Avast, Skype
Still need CCleaner, ASC, Spybot, PowerISO and something else
Oh yeah, that too
Any suggestions?
Lawls.
Lookin' for something somewhat pony related.
