That's good to hear. :)
:)
DoctoDoctorWho: You didnt scare me away, my dad just walked in and I had to abort.
abort abort!
:( Shizustream no more
Code red! Parental figure & ponies within similar proximity!
:D
Jageman: what were we even talking about?
chats ded and i just arrived, i dunno
You're a liar! I can see it in your eyes! http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m63vbxtOza1rvl3xdo1_500.gif
something about an unstoppable robot or somthing
Jageman what are you talking about
Since no more stream I'm going to go play Dark Souls, I may be back later everypony. Bai :)
alexxm: something with DoctoDoctorWho
bye Ninbaws
BEHOLD http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5labdnQ6J1rvl3xdo2_1280.png
Jageman: ah yes, the Juggernaut Mk V ultra heavy combat avatar, good times.
DoctoDoctorWho: Science for the win.
This look so goddang creepy http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m48yk7aTSc1rvl3xdo1_1280.png
I think the primary armor layer was a titanium matrix covered in carbon nanotubes
CrystalPhoenix does that mean that applejack is ass faced
CrystalPhoenix: lolwut :D
SafariMonkey: are you watching it?
which itself was covered in a plastic compound called starlight
Yep Jageman. :P
Hello bronystate.
hai BRUSHYOURTEETH
how are things BRUSHYOURTEETH
Hey BRUSHYOURTEETH! :)
nou
Hey BRUSHYOURTEETH
SafariMonkey: the later episodes are better, the maths episode is funny
Jageman: The second suggestion was look around you maths. :P
Jageman: According to the laws of physics yes, but there are no human weapons, not even thermonuclear warheads capable of generating that much heat.

Night Invi
DoctoDoctorWho: no through brute force, no
and Hello Bornystate :3
asuka pony? this can only end badly
night Invi! :)
bye Invi
Hi Sonny
Hey Sonny!
:)
how've you been Sonny]
no stream on I see?
good alexxm ;) thanks
DoctoDoctorWho: but we can create more heat then a nuke now through the use of lasers
Oh guys
I'm gonna draw King Sombra in a bit
Jageman: Only localised
Jageman: so as far as human weapons are concerned, it is effectively immune to heat based attackes
It's going really well so far, if you want you can join :)
DoctoDoctorWho: true
DoctoDoctorWho: but did you account for internal heating
or... not... ofcourse...
Jageman: and they tested it with high powered lasers as well, it didnt even scorch.
DoctoDoctorWho: that sounds like aerogel
Jageman: are you talking about venting? as in heat vents to cool off the engine?
DoctoDoctorWho: yes
Jageman: Its called starlite, look it up its really cool.(reaaly cool, immune to heat, lol)
DoctoDoctorWho: if external heat is not the weakness, then internal heat would be

Guys?
hey hey hey :3
6_9 ok
11,01Sonny.
oh hi Nittany_Discord
Jageman: I plan on venting it out through the joints, if that doesnt work then I'll add microscopic tubing throughout the armor like they did in star wars
I think I'm gonna draw a bit, I'll be streaming it so if you feel like it you could check it out Nittany_Discord and all other ponies :p
dont bash it, that is totally feasable
DoctoDoctorWho: that would not work. the airflow would not be enough
11,01I saw Sonny.
11,01Might drop in there.
alrighty then :)
DoctoDoctorWho: also, you never mentioned the power source
hello Nittany_Discord, nice seeing you again.
SafariMonkey: the ghost episode is hillarious
so anyhow I was just letting you guys know, ciao
bye
Jageman: that is the one area Im not sure about, power.
Ive gtg, see you in maybe an hour
DoctoDoctorWho: later
DoctoDoctorWho: That kind of venting is used in inscts, and is the reason why they have so limited size.
*insects
See ya Jageman
SafariMonkey: your going too?
Oh my bad wrong person. Bye DoctoDoctorWho! :P

This chat is full modded
00,10aye
Someone found a link to that song in the background of the S3 commercial. GIDDY UP GIDDY UP GIDDY UP UP.
Even when you think they're sleeping, they're watching... lurking... in the shadows...
00,02aparently i havent got many doubles
XAX http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Giddy+Up/4grE6P/overview?src=5
00,02over 4 days of unique music
00,02not including my unsorted stuff
00,10like the show but with work and work I hsve not watched it in ages
XAX I saw it this morning before work
CrystalPhoenix: You've been lurking.
it was in my head ALL THE TIME
00,10only 4 days Phase4?
00,10llame
CrystalPhoenix: know this feel.
hey
Phase4: Check my doubles.
: |
00,02i've got 2.4GB unlabeled mp3's and other misc things that i need to replace
00,02XAX, o_O
Giddy up up should've been the meme
it's such a catchy tune
CrystalPhoenix: You cannot escape.
I kinda wonder when will someone make a remix of the actual MP3
Someone made a remix.
Before the original was even found.
Yeah
the extracted version
He plucked the "giddy up" vocals from teh commercial lol
the extracted wasn't really that great
Nah
Vocals were 2quiet4me
XAX though the remix was alright
yeah
Haven't listened all the way through...
hay everypony :)
Sap Sketch_Toku_Brony
but now that we have the full version
someone needs to remix it
shame only 4chan knows about it
It'll be on EqD eventually...
doubt it
The only brone musicians I know that browse /mlp/ is Yelling at Cats
hey guys
And he does rap, not remixes
Yeah
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353019420254.png I do not believe this
You better believe!
tried it myself
he guess Lyra from the show first
continuing on he asked about MLP fanfiction
I was doomed from that question
CrystalPhoenix: There's variations.
It can work out individual characters from Fallout: Equestria.
this reminds me
I need to read End of Ponies
00,10why would you read somthing you will one day experence

oh dear
EqD can sometimes be a good site. But the comment section.

XAX well yeah it depedns
though don't rely on it for news
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Meghan McCarthy Interviewed on JustUs Geeks

I very occasionally get art from draw friends
heck I barely save picture
I have about 600 wallpapers ._.
Best part is, they're unsorted.
Sumica: let's hope the end of ponies doesn't kill the fandom :D highly doubt it anyway
Jageman: hello? still here?
DoctoDoctorWho: im in a private chat with SafariMonkey
oh, k
Sorry DoctoDoctorWho
its fine
Go ahead Jageman
I can wait

Nittany_Discord + BaconMane? MADNESS
i fufin love this guy
Hey
Who are they interviewing this time?
Phase4: are you done fixing technical things yet?
11,01Me and LC have interviewed together before.
wow
Hullo RainbowPie :)
Hi everybody :(
00,02DoctoDoctorWho, not really in a fanfic mood right now, working on music library
k fine
DoctoDoctorWho: what were we talking about?
Ohey MadSurge! haven't seen you for awhile where you been hiding? :D
Hey Phase4 :D ow ;c
Bloody hell, I've got to redo my music library soon. Not really looking forwards to that. :S
RainbowPie: I lurk and play :O
00,02ohai The_Engineer
Jageman: The Juggernaut Mk V ultra heavy combat avatar.
lolxsplittrial
I'M IN PAIN Phase4 Save me ;c
DoctoDoctorWho: and its non-existant power source?
that yes
/me 00,02gives The_Engineer some chocolate
I dont need chocolate
I mean
00,02D:
00,02who doesnt need chocolate
My chest hurts everytime I breath and It really hurts
00,10hey Phase4, anly luck with that embed?
The_Engineer: did you crack a rib?
00,02Sumica, cant reproduce the problem without a stream
Don't think so
Im estimating it to be roughly 30 feet tall, ot may be big enough to just conventionally fuel it.
DSAUDHAS
GODDAMIT THIS HURTS
The_Engineer: hold your breath for 30 seconds and then take very slow breaths
00,10no I ment the twichTV embed
I'M OUT
00,02The_Engineer, if its that bad why arent you seeing a doctor instead of asking strangers on the internet?
00,02Sumica, yeah, it doenst happen unless theres a stream
so who's using Xsplit trial?
00,10the error?
00,02thats my guess anyway
00,10realy?
00,02yeah
00,10hmmm
00,02well it wasnt shoing up
00,02showing'
00,10cause some were geting the error yesterday
Phase4: cuz we are a very intelligent and supportive community of friends
00,10with no stream
00,10where as otheres got no error
00,02DoctoDoctorWho, you're a doctor, fix him!
00,02:3
00,02Sumica, bizare
/me scratches head
00,10yep
Phase4 because its 3:08 AM and my parents are asleep and it just starting happening.
11,01inb4 kidney stone.
00,10oh btw Phase4, did you want a beta key for planetside 2
00,10it's only 5 days left but enough to try it
If I never come on I'm dead guys :c
00,02Sumica, sure
regardless of what time it is, if you are in pain wake your parents up
00,02The_Engineer, yeah, if its that bad just wake them, get to a doctor
The_Engineer: You really should wake them and tell them they need to get you to a fucking hospital, this sounds serious
If you can't breath easy and you have chest pains call an ambulance.
Sumica: Can we play later? I have no idea what I'm doing.
00,10Suppose so XAX
Jageman: so yeah, conventional fuel.
DoctoDoctorWho: not powerful enough
DoctoDoctorWho: your armor would be too heave
heavy*
I'm gonna have a heart attack any second now
Im using hydraulics in place of muscles, and this would be too heavy?
ya
not enought power to move them
00,02Sumica, yeah, i cant reproduce the issue here
Yeesh, Engineer, get to a fucking hospital already!
The_Engineer: Dude, get your fucking parents and get to a hospital, your starting to scare me.
Don't just stand there and dillydally!

BaconMane: Is your mane REALLY tasted like bacon?
11,01I actually sound good in this interview.
Well my chest pain is starting to stop so I guess I'm gonna live longer now
0,5Is not >>
Yes it is. I randomly hug people, thus the name was created
00,10back in a few, upgrading system memory
0,5Wait a sec

0,5am I in this interview? >>
0,5O: I am
Haunts your dreams: http://imgur.com/nQvd5
00,02ok, this is anoying
:>
00,02the planetside account requires at least 8 characters, one of them must be a number, for the password
00,02and cant compare correctly
polish spitfire
00,02but 1234567890 is a totaly valid password that it considers secure
CrystalPhoenix, :D
Nah, password is the most secure.
Ohai GilDash :D
CrystalPhoenix: i have seen you say that before.
MadSurge: Holla! :)
i have the same password on my luggage
Jageman, possibly or maybe it was someone else
it's from a video
you surely know about it
Man, I really wish I could get into Planetside 2. But the client is rejecting my GPU
no
00,02i thought the world had outgrown secret questions
00,02aparnetly not
http://howsecureismypassword.net/ is a pretty good tool for evauluating password security.
00,02Punkie_Pue, 'password security' is a mostly flawed concept
how so?
I hate secret questions. How the hell is my mother's maiden name more secure then my password if I forget it?
>4 quattuordecillion years
00,02GilDash, secret questions are just aditional passwords with hints
00,02Punkie_Pue, http://xkcd.com/936/
Phase4: Yeah, but some of the begger belief. The best one I saw was one that let you write the question and the answer.
ohai AJIsAwesome
:>
00,02a much better solution than passowrds is public key crypto
00,02it is MORE SECURE than passwords and does not require any user interaction for authentication
Phase4: Yeah, I think you're going over my head now. XD
throwing colgate in as colgate is a bad idea
throwing in colgate as minuette would be much better
Thats the method i am going to be moving towards
00,02i log into my servers with greater security than my banks website
hi AJIsAwesome
That's... pretty good.
Phase4: Maximum overkill.
00,02XAX, it is really easy
Lookin' forward to tomorrow night guys!
Phase4: There must be some downside, surely?
00,02its not "ENTER FIVE BAJILION CHARACTER PASSWORDS"
Tomorrow?
OH
PONE
wait
00,02its public key crypto
Movie night?
/me hugs AJIsAwesome back
00,02GilDash, Nope, automatic login
/me high fives AlienWarhead
00,02the 'password' is a 4k text file, which contains the private key
Movie Night!
Does anyone have an image of Diamond Tiara saying "just as planned" on their stream?
/me brohoofs Record_Discord
Plus ponies on Saturday!
I personally can't wait for new pone. Too many Pinkie pies.
Phase4: Couldn't you just find that and use it as an attacker?
/me brohoofs right back /][\
owait
Phase4: I know what you mean, I 'hacked' into the smithsonian's displays wirelessly from my mobile phone whe I was there. :P
AJIsAwesome: Yes
00,02GilDash, the only 'downside' is that you need that file, and cant really remember it
It's an interview. :P
I can't wait for ponies!
I had my volume muted. :P
I hope the too many pinkie pies all melt into pink smooze.
AJIsAwesome, a quick google gave me this link http://www.derpibooru.org/100011?scope=scpe9bf936b7bfac9c99f75786928ece750c4921bf16
00,02GilDash, thats how its secure, you NEED that file to authenticate and encrypt, the security in that system is kepign that file secret
Who's streaming?
what's this now?
Pink Smooze?
CrystalPhoenix: Ah.
Interview with Mr. Poniator, I think?
Phase4: That's kind of like writing your password down though, surely?
Record_Discord: Nothing can stop it.
Why does Derpgate come up in every interview?
00,02GilDash, its many times easier to keep a file secret than a password, its imposible to guess a private key
Jageman: k back,
Can't understand what he's saying at all.
XAX: NOTHING
Phase4: Impossible or just very impractical?
00,02GilDash, in a way, but i don't have to share my private key to authenticate
00,02it never leaves the computer
00,02GilDash, imposible
Phase4 nothing is uncrackable
DoctoDoctorWho: conventional energy sources would not be powerful enough to move your robots heavy armor
Well, I'ma leave, see all you fabulous men tomorrow
00,02AlienWarhead, you try break rsa then
later Record_Discord
00,02its not possible without a brute force attack (untill quantum computers come through anyway)_
00,02and such an attack would take centuries with current computers
Phase4: I'm going into cybersecurity its going to be my job to think that
Phase4: So possible, just unfeasible.
A titanium/CNT matrix covered in plastic cant be TOO heavy compared to alternatives
:P
00,02GilDash, impossible == so unfeasible its not going to happen
i'm back everypony :)
Hi thelonepony !
Hello thelonepony
do you think stegenography is a better alternitive?
Hi, thelonepony! :)
Phase4: Unless your a transformer haxbot, then it takes 5 seconds
Phase4: True, but you never know. I would have thought it bad practice to tout anything as "impossible to crack">
DoctoDoctorWho: it depends on how tall the robot is
Oh hey thelonepony. :)
Hi Punkie_Pue RainbowBash AJIsAwesome and SafariMonkey :)
:3
00,02DoctoDoctorWho, well yeah, but they probably have quantum computers which via some math magic they can solve the factorization problem that makes rsa secure, there are other crypto systems being researched that are 'quantum safe' though
Hi everybody I'm back because computer decided RANDOM RESTART! TROLOLOLO
lol troll computer
Hi The_Engineer :)
please
no
00,02GilDash, its easier to say imposible than explain unfesibility to every silly person who belives that any posibility == insecure
GilDash: nonsense, its like calling large ships unsinkable. wait...
Hello The_Engineer
Jageman: like I said, roughly 30 feet
AlienWarhead: one time pad is uncrackable (ciphertext and plaintext are statistically independent)
00,02http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography heres an explination
DoctoDoctorWho: even without armor, nothing provides enough power to move it
Phase4: Alright, fair enough. I tend to be a little too pedantic for my own good sometimes. :)
that xsplit watermark
00,02well one time pad is the single exception but it requires a key with as much entropy as the data being sent and the key can only be used once
DoctoDoctorWho: nothing that could fit inside it anyway
Jageman: we have engines powerful enough to move large machinery like that
yup, but it is actually useful (and has ben used) in pratice
DoctoDoctorWho: what are you ranting about now?
DoctoDoctorWho: nothing that is bipedal
so many typos :(
There is a video on youtube that does an excelent job explaining public key exchange.
Dovah: the Juggernaut armor
ah
did i hear my math lab?
00,02point is, public key > passwords
Phase4: Computers have always fascinated me, but I'm shamed to say I honestly don't know half as much as I would like to.
00,02GilDash, start learning then :P
00,02internet is full of information about computers
00,02funny that
Jageman: someone built a semi working mech in their back yard
DoctoDoctorWho: a lot of power would be wasted keeping it balanced, not to mention using any kind of onboard weapons
Phase4: Yes, but how much of it is true? XD
00,02GilDash, a suprising ammount if you stay away from news sites
Phase4: Yeah, even I know enough to know the BBC cocks it up. XD
Dovah: and? someone built a ufo that stays up without moving parts, but its about 6 inches in diameter
Jageman: we have walking robots right now, by the time I have the resources to implement this, balance wont be a problem
hey now
Faux news is 100% reliable
Excellent security conversation guys, I'll get to public key in a few weeks in my security no hard feelings everypony <3
DoctoDoctorWho: balance will always be a problem
00,02well screw you sony
Jageman: its 2 stories tall and can do sit ups and stand.
security class I mean
00,02they put that thing on their logins that prevents the browser from saving your password
Dovah: your point?
Jageman: not to mention balance only comes into play if the vehicle is moving
Jageman: not as hard as you'd think to make it balanced
00,02net increse in securyty == negative, i now have to make my password easier to remember and can easily loose it, requiring the secret question which is even less secure
DoctoDoctorWho: you need to balance, even when standing still
DoctoDoctorWho: and balance is not the main issue
If we have engines to move this mofo, we can move the 30 foot robot http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawler-transporter
Well guys, time for me to go to bed. See you tomorrow!
DoctoDoctorWho: and how fast does it go, hmmm?
BYe, MadSurge.:)
bye MadSurge
DoctoDoctorWho: Hey!! no none image links during stream!! :)
goodbye bronystate
Bye, AlienWarhead. :)
bai AlienWarhead
Bye AlienWarhead :)
DoctoDoctorWho: if you abandon the shape, it becomes potentionaly possible
thanks guys
Jageman: I dont expect it to be fast, I expect it to be durable. I expect 15-20 mph tops
DoctoDoctorWho: you would not get it to move at all
Dovah: thats only video
DoctoDoctorWho: Its top speed is 1 mph
DoctoDoctorWho: nope, its non-image trust me.
DoctoDoctorWho: that crawler has wheels, an efficient form of movement
Bye everybody. I'm off to play
DoctoDoctorWho: and its still lower that someone walking
13Phase4: you're supposed to just have a photographic memory
DoctoDoctorWho: your robot would need to lift its leg up off the ground inorder to move forward
DoctoDoctorWho: not possible
DoctoDoctorWho: and you still have not addressed the cooling issues
Jageman: it walks, in military museum http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/WalkingMachine_USArmyTransportationMuseum_DSCN7543.JPG
Dovah: notice its not armored
Dovah: if it was armored like a tank, it would not move
Jageman: the wide feet keep it from falling over when static, and when it begins walking, it leans to the side slightly shifting its center of gravity, thus allowing it to move the first foot. this is how walking works.
Isn't walking robots the worst idea ever?
Like- just about every method of movement would be more efficient?
DoctoDoctorWho: you are ignoring how much the legs would weigh
DoctoDoctorWho: covered in armor
Vivix: walking is actually greatest form of movemnt, once you get past all the complications
DoctoDoctorWho: the robot would have to lift them up inorder to move them
but those complication makes it horrible for machines, right?
11,02We talking about pony robots? o.o
lol yes
SuperBrony64: Sure, why not?
Vivix: no, its just difficult. When we master the art, we can send drones into areas even treaded vehicals cant go.
11,02i liek poniez ^-^
Who knows what the future of the MLP franchise...
SuperBrony64: ^_^

ohai Pondoo :3
...
11,02Sumica: Running Windows 8?
00,10fuck nah
please say no
Dovah: his robot has carbon nanotubes in the armor, carbon nanotube rope woudl do the trick
ok good.
Im running 8 :(
11,02Throw your Windows 7 away, it's a piece of shit.
8 Isn't bad
00,10went from 4 gigs memory to 16
O.o geez Sumica.
Welcome to the cluub Sumica
Didn't Microsoft's stock go down badly after the release of Win 8?
the sixteen giggers
11,02But...but...
its okay. Im using it becuase the consumer preview is free until the february.
11,02I only have 8 GB of memory O~O
Jageman: who is giving you this? carbon nanotubes cost $10k per millimeter.
GilDash just like how nintendo will go down after the release of the wiiu??
:D
milligram*
Dovah: the military who would be fighting this thing
SuperBrony64: Same ;_;
00,10So I have this idea for a cross over.
11,02Panda: ;-;
00,10Deus ex and the Jetsons
Jageman: you mean you, as a tax payer.
Jageman: it isnt rendered useless once tripped. the main point is that I am wirelessly controlling it which defeats the need for several advanced proccesing functions. I can mimic the movements needed to get up, and the robot will follow.
^^ im kidding SB. I;m actually gonna be getting one :D
Sumica O_o
Panda: Possibly. I personally can't see the attraction, but then I'm not the marke they're targeting.
11,02My Little Pony x Striperella
00,10meet the jensons
Wii U~ im getting one also
Dovah: or i could barrow some left over from the nasa space elevator
:>
11,02Panda: :D
But walking just sounds like-- extra effort for no gain
Jageman: hydraulic muscles are far stronger than you think.
SuperBrony64: NO, SB. :I
Cyborgs made entirely of sprockets and cogs?
11,02The small-hoofed mammal that is property of myself.
00,02Shizuka, XD
ha
you know
Stripperella
SuperBrony64, striperella?
SuperBrony64|Zzz: you watched Striperella? bet you watched BARB WIRE
DoctoDoctorWho: you could never get enough energy out of the internal reactor to get it back up
i remember that show
SuperBrony64... but stripper ponies already exist :3
SuperBrony64 brought up a point
OI!
Good gosh I really can't watch a video with Rina-chan vocing Rarity
stripperella was an awesome show XD
how do stripper ponies work? :)
...
00,10pony striping works the other way around
It sounds like soft-core porn
11,02Stripper ponies put on clothes
Ryunosuke, should I show you?
00,10they put on clothing
xD
3 Days 'till Wii U.
DoctoDoctorWho: too much weight
Panda: oh u crazy animal :D
11,02VenHur: Moo :3
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Possible Canterlot art from Almost a Year Ago!
 
SuperBronyU: Moo.
11,01Put it on!
Vivix: I guess my best arguement is that we are bored of wheels and have this nagging need to advance.
Walking is fun, and interesting, but kinda useless
It can be interesting in augmenting though, like the japanese have in elderly-home research
Oh god! I saw the look of the Wii U, dafuq is that thing?? Lmao
Advanc the science!
DoctoDoctorWho: also, that crawler needs a special road to move on, regular roads and concreate could not handle the weight
sociological and health research > military research any day
Jageman: Look what the Japanese Children have.
http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/6/0/6/58606.jpg?v=1
SuperBrony64|Zzz: you never watched the movie BARB WIRE? it's pretty much the same as Striperella, but it's also a remake of CASABLANCA
a poor one, at best
DoctoDoctorWho: your robot would sink into the ground with all the weight on two small feet
00,10Vivix you talking about that exo suit frame that they made to help old people get around?
Jageman: and we care about the roads of countries we are invading?
Sumica, yeah, I thought it looked interesting
Dovah, it had to happen some time.
With the Wii U, you can now e-mail your paychecks directly to Nintendo with the new Pay Us function.
Buytoast: lel
DoctoDoctorWho: your robot would sink into the ground
00,10So what i heard they have to be ran at 10% output
DoctoDoctorWho: increasing the nessesary power to move it around
dat Ponies47 :3
Kandarihu: Jageman is saying the robot wouldnt walk, tell me thats not proof robots are possible
00,10cause at full output you could rip a bank door off it's hindges
Jageman: the feet are wide so it doesnt sink, I think you are overplaying the weight just a bit
ohai, Ponies47. :)
Hehe, yeah I heard it's too strong at full power
Hi AJIsAwesome :>
DoctoDoctorWho: i don
just imagine, old people rising up against the young, utilizing the power of machinery to overtake all who dare oppose them
until they get a heart attack from all the fun
DoctoDoctorWho: i don't think your comprehending how much that thing would weigh
wut :I
Flying Granny and her team of Mutant Geezers
Hi Ponies47 :)
Hi thelonepony :3
:3
DoctoDoctorWho: gravity is a bitch
/me noms on Ponies47 :3
good old general electrics
Dovah, there's something called the Square/Cube law that says that the larger the machine is, the power required to move it increases EXPONENTIALLY
http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/6/0/0/58600.jpg?v=1
/).(\
DoctoDoctorWho: anything that heavy would be too difficult to move
Dovah: something like that would work
Dovah: but scalled up
Jageman: It DOES work it already exists
Jageman: the suit is built to fit the armor, not the other way around.
Dovah: its saying, "Come at me bro"
DoctoDoctorWho: im just saying that a humanoid design is not the way to go
^^
Jageman: The style of humor reminds me of Monty Python, but much less OTT
you some kind of anti human turrist?
/me throws pillows at Ponies47
SafariMonkey: lol
without humans, there would be no oil! there would be no peace!
there'd be no farms for food
DoctoDoctorWho: also, a nonhumanoid shaped robot would have more space for internal power.
ah, pillows!
also +Phase4 what did Shizuka said? i can see she's asleep (schlafen*)
13wut
00,02?
OMG
?
13where have you been for the last... five hours
O.O
00,02and then Dark92Enigma confued everyone
grounded
DoctoDoctorWho: any the weight will always be a problem
someone tell me this is not intimidating
http://ranqit.com/u/d743fa23-63ef-4dc6-9a6d-81c1d4eee081.jpg
It's not
dammit, i need to refresh :D
It's not intimidating. It's frightening.
Honestyl, as a design, I think it looks humorous, but personal preference aside
Dovah: it looks cool, does not mean its feasable
it's a unwise design choice for anything realistic
DoctoDoctorWho: Where would energy that is converted to heat internally go? Wouldn't vents be a major weakness?
Jageman: Its real, and in japan
Jageman: its a "statue"
It's a statue
Dovah: you know what i mean
it can move its head and shoot non leathal lazers
Dovah: A statue of a robot isn't a robot...
moving head or not
lawl, my computer crash :D
DoctoDoctorWho: anything over 5 tons will be awesome but impractical
I just think giant two-legged robots look lame
Huh and I was gonna tell Sumi about this video. I so slow ;_;
SafariMonkey: "statue" quotation marks are needed has it isnt a full statue, but not a full moveable robot either
like in Fallout3 I groaned and deleted it via console
Jageman: tv tropes refrence?
DoctoDoctorWho: at least for bipedal movement
DoctoDoctorWho: yes
A statue is a statue, moving parts or not
I remember requesting that
Jageman: Whoo tropers! /)
Vivix: statue is non moving
and it got in top 10
A statue can move
look at modern art
not first but it got in top 10
[\
so.....beautiful.....:(
11,01Is this that completed Children of the Night video?
Hold up. this about gundam? i'm doing a semester long paper on these.
Nittany_Discord, no
males use the square brackets
00,10no nitt
I see you got your hooves trimmed
11,01OK.
but the game used some technic he learned from the blog
11,01Same people, though.
DoctoDoctorWho: lol
/me Noms on Nittany_Discord
00,10nope
Nittany_Discord, no once again
00,10this is silly filly
Dovah: OK maybe it's a robot of sorts, but I doubt it could be fitted to move under its own power in walk-like motions using the same level of technology it uses now, so that doesn't prove anything
11,01My bad.
DoctoDoctorWho, the tactics of modern terrorists are not about presenting a show of force. Their strategy is about posing as innocent civilians and bringing shame on anyone who would go after them.
11,01Hey Ponies47.
00,10Crusaders is doing CoN
a gundam would take the equivalent of 7 apache engines to operate
DoctoDoctorWho: also, remember, that starlight has not been commercalized yet
SafariMonkey: :| i just posted it cuz it looks cool....
O.O
00,10Science time
DoctoDoctorWho: and that any tech you get will be available to anyone else with enough resources
Oh hot dang
YAY! :D
HIM
Science! :)
Then again, the islamists might prefer a giant robot during their 3rd phase.
http://www.qualitydigest.com/june06/Images/ARTICLES/3DMEASURE/3-D-Header.jpg now this is a cool robot
i wub Science :3
Kandarihu: regardless of tactics anything that even resembles that link will instill hopelessness and unparralell fear
What doesn't this streamer have in is library?
00,02Sumica, so how do i download planetside?
00,10hoopla
Dovah: I agree that it's awesome, but using it to prove that kind of point would be incorrect. But it's still awesome. :)
HOOPLA!
00,02its been so long that i've forgotten how non steam games work
00,10you go to the site and make a station account
random yay?
00,02Sumica, done, its what triggered the password discussion
SafariMonkey: but dont worries in a few years japan will have it up and running :P
random yay again?
00,10see on the right side of the home page for planet side
Jageman, streamer ping
00,02Punkie_Pue, also that site where you rate password strengh? that kinda breaks password security, it requires you to give out your password :P
00,10where you can input a beta code?
Jageman, You must be new here
DoctoDoctorWho, that robot looks top-heavy. It's probably immune to small-arms fire, but a few RPGs would knock that thing over.
^^
00,02Sumica, done that, thats how i got to account creation
Ponies47: i is noob, ya
isnt ps2 due out in... 5 days anyway? :)
http://www.myninjaplease.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/lw3.jpg
Phase4: I wouldn't enter my own password. Id enter password of simmilar strenghth
00,10you should have been directed to a installer page
Kandarihu: the robot in the link?
00,10check your email
DoctoDoctorWho, yeah
Ponies47: don't worry, he's cool :3
http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/ne/p/2004/NeoMecha2_500x667.jpg
Kandarihu: do you even know what that is?
Phase4: Im sure there is a way to use the site offline as well
DoctoDoctorWho: also, just imaging all that weight when your robot inevitably falls over
DoctoDoctorWho, I'm guessing it's from Warhammer 40K, right?
00,02Punkie_Pue, it may be totaly legit, thing is it fundamentally against how passwords are suposed to work
Everything can be destroyed, and the more parts, the more oppertunities
thelonepony, Seems like it. But he hasen't got my welcome yet :3
OK I gotta go to bed. It's past midnight and I got school tomorrow (today :P)
Bye!
Kandarihu: yes
Ponies47: he will soon get it :3
Bajbaj
Bye, SafariMonkey. :)
Bye SafariMonkey :3
DoctoDoctorWho: i don't care what you make it out of, the armor would take damage, not to metion the internal components
Phase4: That's true.
Baj Vivix. Bye AJIsAwesome and thelonepony. :)
/me hugs SafariMonkey goodbye :)
/me hugs SafariMonkey :3
/me hugs AJIsAwesome back
CNT when wrapped around fabric has a -12% chance of deforming when struck, imagine it strung around a titanium matrix
get what?
yes I said -12%
/me hugs AJIsAwesome and thelonepony
http://www.myninjaplease.com/?p=3936
00,02Sumica, i think it broke, says the code is already activated
/me reluctantly leaves hug to go to bed
so 78percent chance of deforming?
Mechs are already being built
DoctoDoctorWho: i don't care what it is, everything breaks
00,02"We're sorry, the Code you have entered has already been redeemed or has expired"
DoctoDoctorWho: although it would be a tough nut to crack
And the more parts you have in something, the more likely it is to fail, anything mechy has too many parts to be a GOOD design in warfare or industry
Geneticly modified food sounds delicious
Jageman: Go break mt. everest.
00,10skype Phase4
00,02this is going to be one of those things where the game itself is fine but all the authentication around it makes it imposible
Dovah: easy
Dovah happens a littlebit everyday
Dovah: just need an astroid
00,02Sumica, that works too
00,10you should already be in it if you used the key
Jageman: dont die in the process
00,10if it bitches I still have 3 more codes
00,10you can have another one
Dovah: still easy, just need a few smaller astroids
00,10this coper wire, remionds me of a raceicst joke
I just think mech would be a horrible idea in anything except movies or shows- how much more money does it cost to amke it work compared to something more solid and structurally sound?
Dovah: everything breaks
Jageman: they will burn up in the atmosphere.
Dovah: nothing is permanant
Jageman: energy is
the stream interupting for you guys as well?
approx 725,000,000
00,10hell of a machine
cost to build
Jageman: back to previous points, nothing is indestructable. the laws of physics say anything can be destroyed if you hit it hard enough(this is known as the "Ork effect"). Im simply stating that it is so durable that modern human weaponry cannot penetrate it.
Dovah: a bus sized astroid would burn up in the atmosphere?
DoctoDoctorWho: its own humanoid design would work against it
^
DoctoDoctorWho: you would have to abandon that
Jageman: burn up and shatter into too small pieces to be big enought to truly destroy the mountain.
11,01Anyone else getting intermittent buffer?
00,02XD i was extracting a copy of the serenity and firefly soundtracks, it warned me that the timestamps are in the future
This machinery is BEAST!
Nittany_Discord: yeah.
It's madness! It's...IT!
Nittany_Discord: Yes
we have designed robots that get up when knocked over, on their own.
yes
Dovah: have you seen meteor crater
Night: a bit
Jageman: yes
robots are made to be efficient, so often they're made to be smaller and faster, not bigger
00,10.......that seems deadly
lol
Dovah: a few of them would do the trick
one of hte best walker designs is good because it is small, light and fast
Jageman: everest is much bigger and the trejectory of astroids are unpredictible to say the least
Dovah: im not saying it would be easy
Jageman: plus, titanium is lighter than steel, covering it in carbon nanotubes would be like putting on a light jacket
00,10supprise Shizuka is't speaking up yet
sumi mips might be acting up
Im back :)
00,10hmmmm?
00,10how so?
Jageman: [18:08:08] <Jageman> Dovah: easy
wb RainbowPie :)
DoctoDoctorWho: i think your looking past critical problems because you just want a giant walking robot
titanium is weaker than steel though, isn't it? Just not in weight comparison?
G'night everypony! :)
Welcome back, RainbowPie. :)
NIght, GilDash! :)
Night GilDash :)
Dovah, that's a silly argument, don't backtrack on a sidetrack
Dovah: that was before it had to be servivable
Gnight GilDash
Sumica: just intermitant buffer for some if you'll look up abit
:) Is anypony here good with names? I need a little help
Night, GilDash
Vivix: titanium is renowned for being not only lighter than steel, but stronger as well
night GilDash
00,10yeah it's cause i sent Phase4 a file
I've heard the opposite, but I'm not an engineer so I don't know
/me wiki's
Its 20% cooler than steel
the best would be a titanium alloy, not straight up titanium.
Jageman: an 18 ft walking humanoid robat with a flamethrower has already been built in '05 of course its cant move very far and it shuffles more than walks but still.
something like the russian said
00,10I restarted it
titanium is as strong as some steels, but 45% lighter
it's not stronger
Deja Vu
Dovah: and 1 rpg would killl it
I like this show
It probably cost so much with so little yield that the army laughed at it
Dovah: also, no internal power sourse
Jageman: Kinda missing the point of this here robot.
Jageman: yes it has internal power.
hmm I hate my laptop
Dovah: any robot that could walk would be easily destroyed, any robot strong enough would be too heavy
00,10kinda amazing how much work is still done by hand
Building this thing is what i plan on doing with my life.
What on earth is being made here?
straight from wikipedia, The two most useful properties of the metal form are corrosion resistance and the highest strength-to-weight ratio of any metal.[5] In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but 45% lighter
Dovah: the math is not there
DoctoDoctorWho, yeah, I just pasted excerpt of that
00,02ye gods how big is planetside
Sumica: Look up how a rolls royce is made
It is as (equally) strong as some(not all) steels
00,10that's a diffrent story Punkie_Pue
Phase4: 6.6gb.
00,10they choose to make it by hand
00,02XAX, i've got 15GB free space and its complaining at me to free up another 1G
00,10i was refering to some jobs that cant be done by machine
Phase4: it is called "planetside"
Jageman: I think you are being unreasonable in that you are stating there is no solution
Sumica: thats ture.
Phase4: •_•
00,02SpeccyRush, true
00,10it needs room to uncompress data
DoctoDoctorWho: not that there is not solution
As Jageman I think it is unreasonable, a bad idea, but possible
Jageman: I am attempting to think this through as well as I can
bigger problem than being destroyed; how's it gonna walk without destroying the ground under it?
DoctoDoctorWho: there is currently no solution
Jageman: You seem to like to look past the fact that technology is advancing at a rate so fast its very plausable we will have warp capabilities by the year 2300
What is being made?
00,02Sumica, ... its 2012, i can decompress things progressively with tools written in the 80s, this is unreasonable
Dovah: i can see that
We said the same about moonbases in in 1969
00,02but whatever, i'll find a spare gigabyte somwhere
Dovah: but not right now
Jageman: by 2030-2050 we could do this
00,10all karge envioment games do that still
I don't think we will ever see mechs in use
ever-
00,10wow takes 40 gigs to install but only uses 20 gigs on disk
but, I've been wrong before
Dovah it could be sooner...
DoctoDoctorWho: i don't think so, not without some major breakthroughs
Jageman: so what is so hard to believe about a funtional walking humanoid robot used in the military much sooner?
00,02wish they would stop doing that
00,02its incredibly anoying and even more lazy
00,10aye me too
I think blops 2 wanted 24 gigs free 8 to download 8 to uncompress and 8 for the game
I plan on making those breakthroughs.
The deadlier weapons are smaller, faster, and simpler.
Dovah it is a horrible design, absolutely horrible, just about every other military design would be better
00,02plus its gona cause disk fragmentation like theres no tomorow
Dovah: power requirements and weight issues
00,10yep
00,10tis why I run defraggler alot
00,02urgh, i'll just disable the hiberfile
00,02biggest single file on windows anyway
Vivix: some guys thought tanks would never be feasable. I belive the germans ran their asses over first chance they got.
My computer defrags automatically-
Wow...How it's Made? I love this show XD
How Scoot's Made
I never heard anyone say that, a better analogy would be aeroplanes
Dovah: however, if ther was a breakthrough in nanotech, it might happen much sunner
00,10I dont like auto functions cause my sleep schudle
Dovah: sooner
Tanks aren't a good design anymore, in modern wars
but it was in big wars
Jageman: fine, skip out on a giant robot, large exoskeletons exist, they can move realitvly fast and offer some protection from small arms fire
Sumica: I haven't ran defrag in the 10 months I've had my computer...
The only exoskeleton I know banned military from looking at it
00,10I could not run it till I got defraggler
00,10somthing kept restarting the windows one
Vivix: we could build tanks before the world wars, we just didnt have the tech to make it work. same thing here.
Dovah: i can see that in about 20 years
DoctoDoctorWho, but here, it's not just the tech, but the idea itself that is bad
brb all
bai Dovah
Spend extra resources, extre time, extra skill and complication solving, on somethign that would give worse results than a practical, smaller design
00,02there we go, 16GB of space instafreed
Dovah: and have it connected to your nervous system in 30
00,10just because the desgine is bad dont meen it wont end up on the battle field
00,10just look at the bradily fighting vheical
No- but I think it's unlikely, because of money and engineering
giant robots would work better in space, where 4 limbs are more practical for orientation and weight is no issue. too bad no space wars exist
that's a good thing in my book
00,10nice montoage here
Russianbrony: Why stop at four limbs?
A world without wars or armies would be a better world, sadly, not possible as it is
Vivix: walking vehicals are the most useful type of transport there is, its just horrificly difficult
I was on facebook and I forgot I was still on here
:P
DoctoDoctorWho, I don't think that's true, if it were- we would use that on mars now wouldn't we?
DoctoDoctorWho: wrong, flying is
So what is this?
the best spacedesign is apparently a box
00,02for those who wernt here before, http://xkcd.com/936/ how password security actually works
though- that might be a joke
Vivix: Impossible. humans are a naturally warlike species. we make klingons look like peace advocates
I never want to build something that would use passwords- too much responsobility
DoctoDoctorWho, sadly, yes
I'm not a cynic though
SafariMonkey: im going to research that warp drive
Jageman flying vehicles have their own set of problems, but useful I'd agree
ok it is how it's hade cool
Jageman: too much energy expended in staying still, and aerial balance is a bitch
00,02DoctoDoctorWho, walking is a hideously complicated process, we just make it look easy. for raw locomotion wheels are better but limbs are more adaptable to arbitry terrain
lol...I've actually used "correcthorsebatterystaple" as a password (briefly) for one of my programs XD
00,10wrong ep
FUCK YEAH
And it looks interesting doesn't it Jageman?
GUNDAM all the way
Phase4: yes
I want box shaped gundams.... XD
DoctoDoctorWho: not if you use an ionic engine
jking of course.
cool eyed
00,02Jageman, ion drives consume insane amounts of power
00,02and produce bugger all thrust
wait, box shaped ships best for space... fuckin borg
Is it wise to use dictionary words for a password?
dun dun duun
Phase4, basciallt just put as much character as you can?
00,10why do you think the borg used cubes
Is it wise to use dictionary words in password?
I use multilangue and made up words sentences as passwords
DoctoDoctorWho: a florida professor discovered a way to make an engine that ionises the air and uses it for propusion
Punkie_Pue if you use enough
00,02CrystalPhoenix, yes and no, number of characters != entropy and thats whats actually important
Did i spam that? it wasn't showing up in chat
Phase4: i was not talking about radioionic engines
Punkie_Pue: Use about 20 or more random words, sure.
Jageman: I know about Ion engins, I know about lots of theoretical tech
Im preparing for the future
00,10all this talk of passwords is making me want to play uplink
Phase4: those only work well in a vacuum
I have not watched this before so not sure what's gping on
Punkie_Pue http://xkcd.com/936/
going
DoctoDoctorWho: it was just small
Anime nice never heard of this one though but I haven't heard of many anyways.
Jageman: theoretical, near future, I excel in all
DoctoDoctorWho: and it burnned through the battery too quickly
titanium have ultimate tensile strength of about 63,000 psi (434 MPa), equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys,
not to brag or anything...
common, low grade steel alloy
on a scale of 1-10 what would crystal empire both parts be
Hmm...be back soon guys. Gonna try out this LiveCD I just burnt.
You stay classy, BronyState.
Jageman I gotta stop doing this, going to bed and carrying on on my mobile
Jageman: can we make starfleets yet?
00,10dat pinkie VA
SafariMonkey: k bte
That the same voice actresS?
SafariMonkey: bye*
00,10yes
DoctoDoctorWho: no
Jageman: near future
Bye
that girl in the elivator looking thing that was pinkie
gtg, see yall bronystate
00,10the one with the twin drill hair is the same VA as pinkie
my life is complete
DoctoDoctorWho: they would only carry weights under a pound right now
cool
00,02CrystalPhoenix, if that were 25 random characters it'd have an entropy of ~ 118 bits, but its much easier to remember words
DoctoDoctorWho: but darpa wants them for building hovering lightweight robots
00,10yeah but I never remember the names
What is this?
00,02118 bits would take longer than the universe has existed to brute force, your average ssl connection has a 128 bit key, an rsa key is betwene 1024 and 4096 bits in size (actual entropy is less but still large)
http://www.derpibooru.org/153339
Yeah names aren't my strongpoint either >.>
If one uses dictionary words, how much does that weaken it?
Whats playing?
xD that Crash bandicoot
13significantly
CrystalPhoenix: One way is to use the first leter from each word of a custom, easy-to-remember phrase.
00,02Punkie_Pue, thats what the xkcd system is, it still has 44 bits of entropy though
What are you talking about?
passwords
oh
00,0244 bits is enough to be safe unless the password hashes are stolen, even then you're still looking at a fair ammount of time to crack
Hey guys. Hey guys listen. My na'es Chef Vordivask now. Alright cool? Alright cool.
http://www.derpibooru.org/153336 STAIRS Twilight's worse enemy
*name's
im leaving for a while, later all.
00,02enough time to find out about the breach and change your passwords
00,02later Jageman
Bye jage..
00,02Kinixys, too slow :P
No problem. I'll say bye next time I see em.
So- passwords are stored and checked like a checksum?
Wait... no... oh well.
I TOLD you guys that my name is now Chef Vordivask. And you didn't believe me.
I just got here whats playing?
CrystalPhoenix: xD those pictures
Oh Gundum
00,02Vivix, cryptographic hash
Ah nice
CrystalPhoenix: :)
I've seen sites use cleartext--horrible
7 battles.... sure thats invincible...
What Are We Watching Gundam?
sup
Oh god the English dubs are soo bad T.T
what anime is this
Apparently- if I want to study zoology, I have to go 3 years of Biology
Chef_Vordivask I told you i'd shoot! BUT YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE ME! WHY YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE ME!
00,02a checksum has to be deterministic, cryptographic hash needs to be deterministic, exibit the avalanch effect, destroy input information and be reletively expencive to compute
I think biology is gross-
what is name of character with Pinkie VA?
00,02and not exibit colisions
Rainbow_Dash_Fan_Boy: Gundam 00
Phase4, makes sense- I've tested my main passwords on aah "how long would it take to bruteforce my password"
but- no idea how accurate those are, but- better than not knowing I guess
Vivix: Bacteria.. virii.. ect?
00,02they're terribly inacurate usually
Kinixys, I don't like dead things ;__; I'm afraid biology will go into that
00,02if someone gets your password hash assume its compromisde
00,02comprimised
00,02'
Russianbrony: try an entire season, and then we can call him invincible
yeah
ok well I'm going to go play some Assassins Creed 3 now. Bye everyone
I mean, when a site tells me "We've bee compromised" I change all my password sets, despite using different passwords pretty much everywhere
00,10the one in lavender is a guy btw
I swear to you all, I will do everything in my power to make a real gundam. Then I will paint it pink and put balloon decals on its ass.
Ha'
That would be worth seeing
I would personally like to shake your hand when that happens
Russianbrony: You'll have to make it dance.
Norwegian zoological association website. "What is zoologi?" directs you to a page that says "What"
will do.
TA DA! Kiss me!
O.o
cross-dressing?
Some place more quiet?

Gubdam shows almost always have a better then average dub.
Yep.
00,10gits, bebop imeadatly come to mind as good
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: The Dancer
lol... Gubwhat?
Dovah: Depends on your tolerance for WTF and a damn near lack of any likable characters.
but, i hert u ayejay ;3;
00,10alot of it depends on the company doing the dubs
Plus, it's more of a psycological anime than anything else.
WIth action.
Psychological anime...
Kencolt: my tolerance of wtf is unfathomably high.
Dovah: Then I think you'd be okay watching it.
I think Serial Experiments Lain fits best into that genre
Lain always made perfect sense to me.
Taht doesn't meen I don't 4give people, tehlonpon. :<
00,10I think that guys jimmies just got rusted

Gundam 00.
aniderp, its gundam

I dont like 00
i only like SEED
u mean gundam emo?
???????
Future
OK. A gundam pilot that is making perfect sense. That can't end well.

lol. Do you think 00 is perhaps crazier than seed?
yes
bye
All I want, is a mod to stream Wakfu
is that too much to ask?
funny thing is, i gotta go soon to do research on gundam for a paper for school.
Mr. ... .. Mr. ... I can't put my finger on it
irony.

i wish i could do that
Great. Now I have to figure out what he reminds me of
flutter_spin: Oh, any of a dozen Masked Antagonists from almost any Gundam series?

OUTO DA
You gonna eat it already? :D
IT'S SAFE!

08,01so i decided to see how quick and accurate i could do it
inc flu bug
3 second rule...xD
XD
O...
God...
this...
08,01as expected, perfect solution in about 1 - 2 minutes
O.o
08,01but then i got thinking
WUT
i don't know what the hell this is
OW
but i'm liking it
08,01i was doing it in C, and just did the simplest way i could think of at the time
that was totally random
00,10it's nichijou
<--- This joke... XD
08,01so i restructured it with an auxilliary function to test the multiple
This guy... unstoppable old man.
08,01but then this got me thinking
00,10even the name of the show is a joke
08,01can you curry in C?

What's up, guys?
Can you curry in C
Mai finally got the joke Sumica said yesterday
Can you Currency
08,01no, it wasn't a pun
I saw it as one then
Why is it a problem to have a piece of string in your hair? It could be understood as a fashion statement.
00,10those are the best puns
Go Fluttershy!
Bacon[Hazard]: You're too straight!
<--- Goat?
HAH
Yeah like..
08,01currying is basically taking a partial application of a function
I'm so straight!
goatman!
I can't sit down!
Betsuni
08,01so, say i have a function: bool isMult(int a, int b)
BANG
WUT
i like spicy curry
Gundere. <3
:O
08,01that returns true if a is a multiple of b
HE LIVES
08,01and false otherwise
flutter_spin: Give it time...
He must be a cat
00,10it's tsugundere
<---- Fantasy ftw
08,01if i curry that with b = 3, then i have a new function i only have to specify a for
I suddenly want a goat.
...
me-toooooo
She's weak at english
XD
I will get one for the soul purpose of killing and eating it.

Only in japan. I'm going.
Punkie_Pue: Just wait. This is just introductions XD

Wait, robots can't go to school?
OtakuTom: But humour wise, storywise and character wise. :P

Sumica: YOu heard Mandopony's version of this ending?

What is this?
I'm not a fan of anime, especially weird ones like this.
He made it released last week
Nichijou
00,10each ending is done in diffrent song styles
I'm expecting to see someone with cat ears any second.
PotatoFriendly I guess Bo-bobo is a no then?
This is my favorite comedy of the past few years.

Sumica: Ah yes, Deer is Ep 6 :P

Shizuka: I only didn't like it bc I didn't see it from the beginning
I love Angel Beats...I just wasn't around here to catch it >_>

Shizuka: WAIT, I like Angel Beats. :(
I like Angel Beats

I fucking love this show!
this+ponies=profit!
wish i'd knew about this sooner
^ Bacon[Hazard]
This is very confusing.
Not for me. :D
what ayejay said :U
Those who understand have already seen it or are Pinkie Pie.
I would've watched Angel Beats if I had caught the beginning when I could have audio, too
I'd claim the show's creator was on drugs, but I've seen FLCL, so I know better
You guys like random anime? http://anime-direct.com/snaps/Gintama.jpg
Or Shizuka. Or Sumica.
everything makes sense if you throw logic out the window :)
YES
CriticKitten: now THAT show was AWESOME!
I love Gin Tama. :D
RDash5000: like Gurren Lagann!
AJIsAwesome: I love you
shes gunna write on it
thinking we need to have a stream of Samurai Champloo at some point
is there such thing as a casual brony? cause im one :P
HoodyNinja: I'm not ready for that kind of commitment as of now.....
00,10perhaps some excel saga?
the_real_pony_1604: I think we have
Sumica: YES
yes. killer...
Sure, Sumi.
/me friendzoned
wha i missed?
Needs more guitar.
Sumica: ALL OF MY YES! maybe Puni Puni Poemi? it's shorter by far so easier to see the whole thing
HoodyNinja: ponyzoned

RDash5000: OGOD NO

thelonepony: :3
Preferably in the form of guitar to the face
Sumica: You wouldn't happen to have Dragon Half would you?
I hate my stream~
Welcome to the NHK?
/me is new to anime. please don't hurt him.
.....broccoli in bag
Sure why not
"Don't do drugs, kids."
otakon: I'm not sure about that one. When an anime is marked saying, "IF we haven't offended you, we're not doing our job" is in question...
lol...
Ew, broccoli. :I
Inb4 she a ghost
Kencolt: still funny and weird as hell
Broccoli is good
i love broccoli :P
/me feeds AJIsAwesome broccoli :I
the_real_pony_1604, from what I understand about that series, it's not the kind of thing I'd want to see on the stream.
D:
"And it's good FOR you!"
conami ehh, depends on your defenition. I see them as someone who enjoys the show and has little engagement in the fandom. IOW a guy like the show and says "That's my story and I'm sticking to it."
broccoli and cheese is better
But I don't like broccoli, tehlonpon. ;~;
haseo348: it makes you fat with that combo :U
I've already accepted that a teenage girl is armed with military hardware, so a girl carrying broccoli stalks around with her doesn't make a blip on the radar anymore
RDash5000: welp welcome to it, hope you find something that tickles your fancy bc there are ALL KINDS
thelonepony: lol still good...
otakon: i will tread carefully
but you must eat it ayejay :I
SHE TOOK THE SALISBURY STEAK!

Buytoast:....I forgot
Buytoast: That site doesn't allow hotlinking
You know what someone should stream here? Some classic Abbot and Costello
*but
Buytoast: But for some reason I'm getting the correct image I wanted to post instead of the no-hotlinking image
cow needs more fiber or something
And more DCD. :'(
moving on...
So, my dad bought my brother BLOPSII today...
Eddmario: was he happy?
Eddmario: Im so sorry...
Okay sorry guys for that picture, forgot about that hotlink protection image
or to much energy
well i got 14 kills in tf2 today, which is actually a world record for me
that site should be sorry, J_E_Smith71
Mega_Milk: Thanks, but it doesn't help that I'll have to hear him going "OMG YOU FUCKING DOUCHEBAG!" every few seconds...
but anyway
Oddly enough I'm getting the correct image I wanted to show. Don't know why it works for me and not you guys
Eddmario: kids these days with those words /)_-
But seriously, we should get some Abbot and Costello on here sometime...
Since I don't recognize the HUD, I'm assuming this is a GTA game...
And more DCD!
Or one of the first 2 Saints Row games...
see ya everypony i've got a date with my bed
So, when is 7 X 13 = 28?

Don't make Shizuka angry, you won't like her...when she's angry.
twilight_sprinkle: I did, when? >_>

twilight_sprinkle: but that would be a waste of paper, and i think i would nom it once when im finished with it....the dentist told me not to eat anything for 1 hour.......but i don't know what eat mean's...so i nomed on 2 poptarts n the way to school

AskPeachy, you remember during the premier when the IRC crashed? This is the part where they try to make sure it doesn't happen next time.

sprunkls
lul
y u not get to da choppa
yes
Well, any landing you can walk away from is a good landing
Because,
Although little is truly known about brony behaviour, it would be logical to assume that scrapping is in some way related to choosing fit members of the speicies to mate with.
lawl
Jageman: ........
Jageman: and with that....
xD
u made us sound like
a race >:I
who did what now?
>_>
I got my funny bone back a few minutes ago.
Jageman: Don't get bitten by a clown.

Go back to works Ayejay :3
yeup
i need to get that game
AJIsAwesome|Busy there's a glitch in this game where you drive into a swingset and it flings you across the city while impossibly wrecking your car. Then, no matter how fucked up your car is, you can drive it like it's good as new.
um.... im online
Eeyup, Shizu. :D
Canadian_Brony: That's hilarious. :D
IKR?
I saw it on a Screwattack vid
From the back that thing looks like a TIco.

Hey! Hey! Listen! Link! Watch out! Listen!
humans are humans

humans are ponies
well, that worked . . ?
Ponies are OBJECTION!
Rockstar said that if they release a new gta4 game every year, the fans would lose interest
that swing set has some bounce to it.
put your can in the air
it's no less "too far" than shooting a mother or a 60 year old helpless person lol
car*

superretroworld: ahh well shucks
i see
your computer too slowly
lawl your computer IS TOO SLOOOOW
AppleBloom: :)
And this is asuka remember
Sarah_B it's a glitch. You run into it and it flings you into the air. It also wrecks your car to the point where it should be utterly impossible to drive, but if you land wheels-down, you can drive it.
sprunkls, like urs :U
oh niiiice
;~;
shizumobile: ya know that technically means if it didn't lag out you woulda been flying so far

Rain: [01:09:25] donutpop365: because the gyrobowl defenses are no match for my god.
E

Rain: He typed the "k" with a different characterm upon closer examination.
Sarah_B it's a very annoying meme
Rain rain!

Trying hex unicode conversion probably gonna get kicked... gak
well see the first time I learned about twilight_sprinkle's god was last saturday when they were advertising it
didn't realize is was such taboo over in chat
Didn't work!
but g a k is my religion
I used to have that goo stuff
when I was like
donutpop365: its much more simple than that, just search for different language letters
6
twilight_sprinkle: Ah okay!
I had legos when I was 6
donutpop365: hell you can even use messletters
when I see ponies I g.ak all over the room and my pants
AppleBloom if you think this is bad, you should've been around when Fight Club was being streamed. Sumi put the kickscript to good use that week..
still do to! And they still hurt whenever i step on them :'(
why do swingsets break physics?
GaK
Jageman cuz it's fun :D
my fantasy is to spray my g.ak all over Rainbow Dash's backside
Failed!
Canadian_Brony: that makes perfect sense
Lemme try another.
donutpop365: wait a bit
ᴳᴬᴷ
Small looking....
twilight_sprinkle: Autoban or something?
donutpop365: yeah, 1 min after 3
twilight_sprinkle: I thought Sumi countered what you were doing to bypass the kick
Sarah_B: ???
HAI ALL
shizumobile, run directly into the middle one and try to ride up on it a bit
twilight_sprinkle: 1 minute after 3?
what game
donutpop365: after 3 kicks in 1 or two mins or so
gta 4
I want to spread my g.ak all over her mane and blue coat
and make her want it
twilight_sprinkle: Ah, got it.
lol stand off time
GAК
Yay.
sarahs scarring me
It works.
that guy just vanished
Sarah_B this is not 4chan. Please act appropriately before a mod steps in.
GAК! Mmmkay I shall.
Okay it works :D
If people are still saying that word, Saturday's going to be fun. Can't wait to see the total kick numbers after the episode
what is innapropriate about spreading a children's toy on a pony???
anyone going to get the next gta?
00,10so do I start manualy baning or do we give it a rest?
O.O how did the police get in there
I vote banning
Sarah_B: its alluding to weird stuff
owned
sumi manualy plox
cop wants to fly too
????
stop playing with unicode around, do gak directly bitches
what is is alluding to?
Sarah_B: you know
Sarah_B: Because the way you were saying it could have been taken in...ahem...dirty matter

Sarah_B: Not me, just the way other people were reacting to it
this is umamusing. Sarah_B please stop.
wait what did he mean
What?
lol the cops is glitch blocking
oooh boy god now I've done it-_-
Don't even get the context sorry.
lol
ohhhh
that's just wrong
but seriously, all I mean was a g.ak covered pony
i think it would be so cute
that would be awesome of in game characters would prevent players from using glitches
that'd be annoying Jageman
hi guys
hey djpon3y
Jageman: dude, thats probaly the most clever idea
sup djpon3y
man shizus having a hell of a time with the glitch
lol
lol swing set
aaaaaand nvm
:D
AppleBloom: but imagine how good they would have to be programmed to understand a glitch was happening and prevent its use
Sarah_B: Yeah I see now, but someone else said "This is not 4chan, please act appropriately before a mod steps in." That person thought you were being dirty with that statement
/me anger swing gods
gtg
/me swings away
no, shizumobile.
I'm gonna miss Saturday again :( NOT the one after that though! :D
seeya anon-
dah
i want a game that can learn and react in real time
lol
yeah but some glitches add to the game Jageman
thats not a glitch. the car just had a panic attack
eoe domut
donut
that sucks
Jageman: true
Jageman: lol then wait till Skynet makes a game :D
there is an article about g.ak in Harvard Business Review -- http://hbr.org/
no shizu you cant drive through that wall
donutpop365: Thanksgiving weekend, impossible not to miss it
I wouldnt really want to play it if I did
ikr
Sketch_Toku_Brony: skynet would not make a game, it just makes war.
Jageman: lol ya never know
that would be awesome
is it strange that my birthday is the same day as judgement day in terminator 2?
if you could make an ai that makes gamees
J_E_Smith71: Yeup.
eyup
AppleBloom: Clearly you're Sarah Connor.
no its not, AppleBloom. there are 365 days in a year, someone was bound to land on it.

Nope. :|

I like how they said to not say it and then everyone just feels like saying it
Sumica, did you repair the script to work with foreign languages too?
obviously, donutpop365
dem misses
it's useless
00,10tell you what test me and I remove your abilty to talk
Heli+swingset = greatfun
I dont think they care, Sarah_B
you cant fully repair that fully donutpop365 , you can only fix letters one at a time

Woah, that was fast Sumica. What is your script written in?

that was quick
2 DAYS
10:30 AM, EST I think.
I can't wait
why stream no work?
pinkie pie turns into a g3 pony
No one's streaming at the moment.
no lie
no stream pony_1987
i saw it in a commercial
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMqWJSQ1Ot8
aw oh NocturnalBlade
Technically, we shouldn't be talking about the new episode. We're not allowed to. :)
That commercial was creepy
05pony_7777: well if thats true, then why the fuck are you sayign it in a chatroom with a zero tolerance to spoilers? tsk tsk
smile?
I don't think that was necessary...
05too bad
Well stff happens
stuff
11,02Ponies really need to read our rules...
^
05sometiems i wish i wasnt a mod
05that way i wouldnt have to read spoilers to ban for spoilers
wait you have to do that?
He doesn't, but I don't think he thought it through
11,02Well...how else are we going to know if they're spoilers unless we prove they are?
11,02'Pinkie Pie is best pony!'
Even joke spoilers aren't allowed.
11,02Time to do some research on this....
aww man i'm sorry
I don't even like joke spoilers.
05if you say somethign that may be a sppoiler
The funniest joke spoilers are the ones that turn out to be true
05and you dont say it in a "i think" matter
05then you just screwed yourself over
Even then its not that funny
Wow
Good thing I don't come here that often
Appealing is still possible, right Wrek?
05always
Ok.
05but dont think I look kindly on scrub spoilign it for otehr people
Hey Wrek, is even saying which character the episode will focus on and nothing else count as spoiling?
05in my eyes, Tom shouldnt even say the episode names casue that is a spoiler
I can understand that.
What is the name of this ep :P
!cd
Episode 3 of season 3 "Too Many Pinkie Pies" airs in 1 days, 7 hours, 45 minutes, 51 seconds (Nov 17 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
Oh
:I
05see?
Yeah, the title practically gives it away.
I have no idea what this could be about
>_>
Darn you are right taht spoiled it
Unfortunately.
thst
that
geez I can't type today
Wrek: Is it even not safe to say something tame like "This next episode's a Pinkie episode" or "Next episode's going to about CMC" and nothing else?
05I suppose those would be alright
I would think not, but assume so
05but if i was in charge id not look kindly on it
Geez one of the meme websites spoiled it for me already but hey you are bound to run in to some spoilers here and there. It is the internet
05pfft
05i kept completly clean for season 2
05season 3 2 things are spoiled for me
If you see a bully beating a kid to death on a playground and dont try to stop them, you might as well have been beating the kid yourself.
debate this ^
05theres nothign to debate
05its obvious
Rain: Its a conspiracy
05that bully needs an axe to the balls
13^
You're being framed
^^^
Best answer ever
Not an effective way of killing someone, but painful enough
xD
Thank you very much, Wrek and Shizuka
I woulda just hit him with a big rock
/me 13gives rain rain a warm blanket and a cookie :)
Where are you gonna get an axe at a school?
13wrek's answer to everything is axe, it works :3
05HoodyNinja: i alwasy cary one around
Wrek: Do you even try to look away from the next episode ads too?(Personally doesn't like the fact that the Hub is spoiling things that would have been good suprises)
Or you could string them up in a tree by their balls
05J_E_Smith71 i dont watch the live eps
05i wait for a youtube version withotu commercials
05doesnt mean i dont mod chat
Your school has some loose security
oh geez the gak...
I hope you remember your answer on the 20th.
dat link
05HoodyNinja: why would we need security?
Wrek: That's smart I 'spose
Wrek: People like you
05pfft
05if people were like me
well gta was fun
:>
05there'd be world peace
Yes the best thing ever. I got kicked but it was worth it to know
Raising awareness is the least you can do to stop the murderous bullies.
Everyone would need a security gaurds
05casue there wouldnt be idiots provoking me/us
Everyone would be fighting, too.
war?
You don't intimidate yourself
unless you are fluttershy
dammit Rain
Thats an explosion waiting to happen
am nthe easyest and best #1 of cavilian self defence is being supper conspicuous
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?
Supper sounds good
I'm easily forgotten :D
05but really
yes you cna eat conspicuous
05schools over here dotn have security
05they dont need it
mine didnt
Mine does
05specifically after 9th grade
but because they didnt care if the "feminine boy" got "his" ass kicked :\
No one acts up though, security is just a nussiance
i wish i had goten bullied at school -3-
no you dont
I don't ever see bullying anymore
Wish? .-.
Dafuq is bullying?
it would have been fun
Never hoid of it
I have a friend with a broken spine that will never be straight again because of bullying
o.o
No you don't, taoumi.

05really
05only thign ever come out of bullying

11,02When in doubt, pinkie out.
Or you know, just gouge the fuckers eyes out
... This chat is starting to get depressing ;~;
05AdamTheDuck: live is depressing
Whatever works
05f*
It truely is...
Doesn't have to be
Wrek: Make it happy then
Fire extinguisher makes a good weapon as well
I try to make it happier
00,10kept a peice of tunned aluminim barstock in a hidden sleeve on my backpack
but people like to sweep things under the rug
05i lucked out on the bully department
I just carry around a knife
05i was stronger but not as fast as the soccer faggots
I have never seen actual bullying
05the sweet taste of vengeance when I got hold of one of them~
You don't want to, HoodyNinja.
Wrek...
11,02faggots isn't a nice term :(
You really don't.
00,10it was bad at my JH and HS
05SuperBrony64: and i dont use it often
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Marijuana supports peace
apparently
11,02Still, people shouldn't use it in that context :/
I got bullied by a girl once. it wasn't fun
SuperBrony64 they shouldnt use it at all
BULLIED or picked on
There is a huge difference
okay
Maybe some Shizumusic will lighten up chat. ;~; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcrJHO_FxCU

11,02You should use 'faggot' when referring to the literal defintion which is a bundle of something.
13bluh... what a shock, modem switches to 10MHz upstream, two seconds later connection dies...
11,02Like sticks.
Isn't it also about ciggerates?
I thought it was a bundle of twigs?
11,02definition*
also kindleing
11,02[Alpha]: Can be used for that, but it's not limited to just twigs.
It's also a ball of chopped meat and liver mixed with bread and herbs, eaten fried or baked in the UK.
11,02Though, I can't imagine anyone who would use the term today...
Ahh, the beauty/horrors of English denotative and connotative meanings...
11,02Outside of the negative use that is...
05all in all
05few isntances i warrant demeaning tersm
L2P FAG<--- Like that?
05is those 7 back in those ages
SuperBrony64: like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4m0xzrwsvc
you know, the term faggot comes from when gay people were thrown on a burning bundle of sticks.
Also, isn't fag slang for cigarette as well?
it is
I meant you didn't like it used like that...
"flaming faggot" used to be a death threat.
My bad

AJIsAwesome: Which one of you damn motherfuckers just said that shit?!
Sumica: So it's just a movie or a movie of a series?
00,10you do good work wrek
Wrek: i didnt think you would bring that up :D
13i think we need to disqualify summer wars from movie night voting :3
Why, Shizu? :<
00,10meh it would still be good for it
00,02we've watched it outside a few times
A movie or B?

00,10so long as they have been introduced yeah Freyzi
I love Japan. I need to take another trip there sometime in the future.
Is there a way to see the movie voting page?
Especially Nagasaki. It's pretty peaceful there.
05but yeah sumi Arn 1 and 2, sometime at the end of this month or beginning of next

awkward
00,10Ecoyli, you would sign up for the newsletter

Baseball, what an odd thing to be popular in Japan

05wonder why...
baseball still sucks
So what movie is this?
mornin'
Mornin' SirGanjalf
Wrek: just cause it says world, doesn't really mean it so much
Hi, SirGanjalf. :)
00,10good luck remembering any od those names
Japan reminds me of my own country, family is extremely close even when it branches out and there are a lot of family gathering
00,10horny old man
I think Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners
Ah, the stereotypical perverted man. :D
05sumi
05chekc skype
*old man
[]DeadpoolDash: Yep, don't know if it still works but at their ball park you can use the DS to order food and look at live game stats
oh by the way Wrek , I know what S.O.P.A. stands for... but does sopa mean anything in swedish?
05its a degradory term
05basically this
00,10realy?
05it can mean sweeping
loser?
05its also a degradory gamer term for someone who sucks
00,10every family has one
05sopor
Eww..... :S
05means trash
sopa means soup in spanish :p
05sopa is sweepign up the trash
05but aslo a term for someone who sucks
kids in the tub..
enter the black sheep
Someone coming from 'Murica?
well thanks for the lesson Wrek :)
Called it
00,10sold grandma's mountain
lol Engrish
05SpeccyRush
05its more that
05someone who sweeps up trash in the streets
05couldnt get a proper job
05henceforth
05sucks
man that phone has an annoying ring
05hence degradory term
05but most commonly found within gaming
working for sanitation pays pretty well
kk I think I gete what you're saying
00,02sopa is like putting locks on houses while the robbers are robbing banks
11,02Night all :)
Really? What a timid guy
13sopa is putting a lock on a house made of glass
wait are we talking about the sopa bill?
00,02except they perfectly duplicate the money such that nothing actually goes missing
Night, SB. :)
no SuperBrony64|Zzz
13actually scratch that
13you know in the old looney tunes cartoons where a house blows up and all that's standing is the bathtub and the front door?
Yep.
13well sopa has the best lock on that door
13and with that, an hour after i should have bread, i bread
00,02it's funny how they think dns filtering actually prevents pirates
05anythign else swedish ya wanna know? answering questiosn was kinda fun xD SpeccyRush
00,02night Shizuschlafen
Remember that Oz thing from the beginning? Here it is again
Night Shizuschlafen
00,02even funnier how they think it stops torrents
In the future, cyberspace is easy to discord
00,02torrents do not need dns
00,02or any central server of any kind now
11,02AppleBloom: No? :(
another dell
ID Theft
00,102056 bit code
SuperBrony64|Zzz: what are you still doing awake? :P
00,10he cracked it over night with pen and paper
00,02its like 2048 except theres more bits
well aside from I guess greeting dialogue, nothing else right now Wrek :)
00,10Place got discorded
If I had the power of teleportation I'd make it my life goal to find every douchebag who does things like ID theft, and SMACK EM!
05well what kidn of greeting dialogue?
05it links to the nsfw version now
00,10oh/
trolls everywhere
Stop using my Disney park tourist avatar
in english please, responds in japanese
Then just Digivolve:p
00,10enter the king
"and then chat gone mad..."
Johnny Lightfoot?(That reference is too obscure)
Animation sure is beautiful
^
00,10system upgrade
Oh shit
Digivolve to...
Digivolve into! Freakymasmon!
Is this a metaphore of Disney "eating" other franchises?>_>
Wrek: well i guess hellos and goodbye and if theres a certain greeting method
stuff like that
05well what kind of situation?
SirGanjalf: I...guess?
i hate drawing eyeballs
05i love drawing eyes taoumi :3
00,10notice how much this looks liek digimon just polished
they are just so friken technical
most of the time you have the luxury of beign able to see both at one Wrek -3-
No way...
dat ukulule
once*
Gotta love the Engrish
05SpeccyRush: its situation
Ahh, just ignored everyone using color.
05situational*
So much nicer.
lunas eyes giving you trouble taoumi ?
Love Machine
00,10not too smart
Bigcheese: Except the people using color are the mods
00,10ingnoring the mods
Such a harmless name for a dangerous thingamabob?
nah SpeccyRush. it's just alot of mesurements to make sure that the two look similar enough to not end up like ponkie poe
Wrek: ok either greeting your gfs family or one about business deals
taoumi: ah kk ^^
Heh well sucks to be them alright
/me cuddles with Shizuschlafen and yawns
so i finish one eye and fairly fast to make it look like a reference picture SpeccyRush. then i need to put down the lines on the second one based on the first.... and that part is annoying
same w/ the cutie marks
05well for eitehr id avoid the more casual oens liek tja, tjenare, and use variatiosn of hej. for isntance: Hej, tack för att jag fick komma. (which is liek hi, thanks for havign me/lettign me visit)
05really theres a million ways to greet someone in different situations
05tja is most used in groups of friends
05very laid back n casual
sleep or summer wars.... uhmmmm
Summer Wars

But I cant put my finger on it
I wish our awesome on the internet can be like that.
our internet
00,10ikr
X(
is this kinda like digimon?
00,10funny you say that Invi
Invi, yes but better imo
00,10same studio did both
I rememeber that old Digemon movie.
00,10and we just watched digi mon befor this
The one with the virus
What was that one called?
00,10that one ^
the digimon movie?
oh okay
00,10granny's jimmies are rusted

00,10no worse aniderp
badass grandma teaching lessons like a boss in 3
Man he's completely lost it
:O

gandma's crazy
That guy can only think about money.
Well she does have the blood of a samurai....
he broke things
he should be ashamed
awwww
00,10time for netsplits
Maintenance? welp, time for dinner then.
:3
Wonder how big it'll be.
00,10full network
Hoefully not too big
Hopefully*
so i might come back as aniderp1
Nintendo used to make those cards.
Why not? Too early in the morning on the East Coast so not many users on at the moment round here
They did, Java? :O
not much bigger then "full network"
Yep
Wow.
i live in usa east coast
???
00,10most that will happen is you will lose contact with people on diffrent servers then you
They also had secret relation with Yakuza to fund their first console.... Oh well.
You know, I saw what happened to Bigcheese. I get the feeling he doesn't even know what he did wrong.
00,10it's for the greater good
00,10a certen website is to blame for network issues >_>
Sumica, does said website start with a 'four'?
00,10nope
Okay then.
00,10but it ends with a state
is it start with 9??
Hey at least they do the maintenace now instead of some important time like Movie Night or new episode
Aaaah
It was 4state!
Sumica, is it because of the ponychat issues last week?
00,10mmmhmm
00,10dem feels
hehe
nooo
:(
Whe nthis happened I heard the Fluttershy yay
she gone :<
Guess the work is to make sure it doesn't happen during the new episode
Terrible timing
00,10Granny died
im so alone over here :(:(:(
Awwww
she ded
Ecoyli: Sumica's ping
00,02i got pinged
00,02but i dont see ping
Awesome granny died :(
00,104state

I must be running behind
00,10probably Phase4
it's worse the nthat
00,10the virus killed granny
Then her heart exploded then
I know a guy like Wabisuke
Fucking egoist, guy like that.
00,10all the feels

hold her you fool
kiss her fool
what is oz?
that family acts kinda stupid , its like blaming Einstein for dropping the nuke. the guy had his producttaken and weaponized and suddenly its his fault
It IS his fault
He doesn't even try to help to stop it
00,10it was a hacking AI
but it was openhimer that actualy made the thing TrixieMuffins
00,10it was already a weapon
00,10only it was released on the net with out his say
hey guys what dose gakmean i keep seeing it every where
lol
forbidden here..
00,10*snerk*
the forbidden g word
Oppenheimer*
We don't speak about g-word here, anymore...
00,10there is a know your meme on it
Ok bye everyone. Have to sleep.
Bye Ecoyli. :)
taoumi, but einstein made the basics
cool map
night Ecoyli
Sumica do i need to install episodes from liberty city for the multiplayer or it's just extra stuff ?
therainbowvortex: It was a series of toy ads that played over and over during the S3 premiere in a row and everyone poked fun at it and spammed the hell out of it. Somehow it turned into a forced meme
00,10but the long in the short of it hub shows too many gak ad's in a row
00,10and well with all the bronys watching
^
now sumi has to kick himself :P
its a toy from the early 2000'2 right?
they going on a raid
2000's
00,10Nice PC
what the-
super computer much
00,10now we need power
Thats' a big ass Black Wii
genius driver
Let there be light!
At least Einstein and Nobel done something to compensate their inventions.
Especially Nobel.
00,10a squid boat should give us enough power
what enstine made Invi was a theroy on how mater in the universe came to be. oppenheimer was the one who actualy made and did the math to release that energy
00,10now we need internet
fish
Heheh
taoumi, yeah but if einstein hadn't that revolutionary theory, oppengheimer had no basics to do his math
secret agent man
This family is awesome.
My Summer Wars senses are tingling.
Hacker family.
Them DSes
dem gameboys
it looks like a dsi
well that's liek saying that al lmachines that use f=ma were made my newton
family that hack together, stay together.
now is that a boy or a girl?
could never tell who the rabbit king was
Kazuma is a boy?
Boy, I think.
ah
a boy
Awww
Java, yup
alrighty, here goes nothing
Alright. Catch you on the flipside
taoumi, they use it as a basis
I thought he's a she. When I saw him I think "cute"
Uh oh here we go
Bye, Kandarihu. :)
00,10see you on the other side
Night, Kandarihu
inb4 netsplit
Mmm splits
00,10too late rain
bye maybe
aaand netsplit
00,02oh yeah, server restarts
lol
Now excuse me while I shower my head first.
That only took two seconds
00,10200teraflops.
Well, suddenly flipside
00,10is that big Phase4?
phew
also Sumica, I pressed it right as the splits happend. was funny
00,10Well with luck that will meen we dont have errors saterday
hm
but newton was not directly responsable for them Invi. that's my point, yes they brought out the basic math. but enstine no more invented the nuke then newton invented the gun
the split happened already?
aniderp, yep
00,10chat recorded over 40k
aniderp: Yeah it was brief
we all stayed..
even though that argument is voind considerign the gu ncame before the 4 laws of motion
I want to go dinner but this is getting interesting!
00,10video recorded close to 250K
Sumica: Wow.
Even if the network goes down like it did last Saturday, if it comes back up like it did just now, it won't even be a problem
lol minecraft avatar
00,10well the error was Kandarihu that they hit a user cap
go bunny warrior!
00,10but yeah good god we had so many viewers
hmm
Sumica, I see. So the network kicked everyone in order to weed out the idle viewers?
Hey that minecraft avatar hes pretty easy to make i can do that
Sumica: More than S2 finale?
00,10I was expecting 5-7k
250,0000?
00,10not 250k
250,000? That's a lot of bronise...
huh
reminds me of Overgrowth's fighting system
link vs ganon
lo lsquid
taoumi, it's a grey area. they are not responsible for ehat other people do with their work, but it is still used as basis
link is the bunny
*what

December 2012 is close. The Brony army is almost ready.

Seriously though, Pluto was one of my "planets".
Nothing happened to the rock. It's just no longer being regarded as a planet anymore.

Are you sure you weren't just hearing Britney Spears dubbed over in French from your neighbor's TV?
I've had that one happen to me more times than I'd like to admit.
If it does then she will summon Soggoth :p
Java it's not french
It's not?
I should watch it again to be sure but I remember not hearing a single french word

The song in the video is in english but the people doing it were french
Maybe that's why. I remember it as French because of the band origin.

Java: AJ was looking for her hat
I found Rarity to have the best hairdo, followed by RD. Pinkie's was bland, and so was Fluttershy's IMO.
Java I disagree
Rarity had the best Hairdo
then again Rarity is best pony
No one comment about Twilight's XD
No stream correct?
Nope, Ponies47.
Java who's Twilight
Nothing about her hairdo really changed.
I think that fit her so well.
Twilight Sparkle. Librarian
Librarian hair do
doesn't ring a bell

xD
Get ready
It reminds me of her hairdo for the gala. It didn't really differentiate from her normal hairstyle.
anyway RD's harido is pretty much http://derpy.me/aRDul
and I have to go
Now RD's hairdo was pretty interesting. Never thought her crystal design would be like that, considering her normal hairstyle.
Bye CrystalPhoenix!
BYe, CrystalPhoenix. :)
Actually RD hairdo is this:

just about 75%
No, they last 30 seconds to a minute now i tihnk
and they're cooldowns now

AdamTheDuck: i'd like to see Forrest Gump....what do you think of my picks?
15-60 seconds
hell, the only totem without a cooldown are magma and searing
Dark92Enigma, I haven't heard of Neverending Story, and I still have to go watch Doctor Who... >.>
:(
I remember watching it on TV a few years ago and loved it
omg neverending story
Im still upset im not going to be able to behead Garrosh

Dark92Enigma, can't remember which ones now... The only one I remember is that of the children with the gas masks
it's really nice
Deacon: even tonight?

AdamTheDuck: no, i mean which one (either the A movie or B movie) because the one with the gas masks would be.......

Probably wouldve been funny with the newbies
Nemo was good
I know the movie front and back :3
Which is why its no fun watching it with a group of people irl...
08,01we're showing Dead Alive tonight
08,01which is possibly the goriest film ever made
Ive never seen that, is it good?
08,01it's one of my favourite zombie movies EVER
I just remember some bits..its been a while since I last saw it.
Hmm, gore?
Awesome : D
08,01(was directed by Peter Jackson)
I might stay for B movie then :3
08,01it's got *the* best zombie scene
08,012 of the best, actually
08,01Alchemist: don't make me kick you for spoilers

Alchemist: But my father is dragging me to golfing with him tomorrow :'(

08,01heh
08,01you guys are gonna love this film <3
RaveBrony: sounds boring :(
08,01it's been nearly 10 years since i've seen it
RaveBrony: are you the caddy?
Dark92Enigma: it's all epic
and gross
I actually enjoy golf... but i would like to be here for This movie night :(
oh i can't wait
MadSurge: Nah, he just wants to bring me along.
RaveBrony: can't you be here for tomorrow's night?
'cause I'll totally be here tomorrow
Tomorrow's movie night is at 2pm for me.... and tee-time is at 1, i think
D:
As for tonight, ive got damned college work to do
No,w my Java assignment can burn in hell, i dont understand that so im not doing them.

DUN DUN DUUUUUN
upside stream is best stream
^
Is this
No
Upside down? .-.
Omg!
and backwards
Lmao! I loved this show when i was little! :D
and hes walking backwards -.(\
my mind is full of buck
Heh, so why are we watching it upside down?
Okay, never mind
Because it's BUCKING OPPOSITE DAY
its Topsy Trivy
i think scoots is f'ing with us
>_>
HAH! Joke's on you!! Im now sitting upside down in my chair now!
Hold on a second.
>_>
Scoot-Scootaloo, isn't it about 9am for you?
DashWithRainbows: No it's 8:52am est >: (
Trolling duck
Well sorrrry.
Mister grumpy butt.
<3
bbl
I need some breakfast
Oh, also Scoot-Scootaloo, hopefully my copy of Halo 4 should arrive tomorrow.
If it doesn't though, I'll have to wait (hopefully) until monday.
Aww yeah! We can play some Spartan Ops next week! ^_^
Im not entirely pleased with Halo 4 :I
The point system, classes, and armor are a bit much to me.
RaveBrony, hmm
I was wondering if there were going to be people with that opinion
eh only thing i dont like is no presicion control in Forge
Scoot-Scootaloo Saxy should have his copy by now, shouldn't he?
He should :S
I mean, I stopped playing at Halo 3, I was just wondering how some will cope with these changes in Halo 4.
I don't know, he hasn't told us if he got it
Maybe he is cranking it out right now?
Or he's still asleep.
I pretty much stopped PvP at Halo 3
Played the campaigns for the other games after that
drunk people
But now you play online and it depends on what armor you have to be better... kinda sucks for new players
Or at least thats what ive seen so far.
Whoa what
YAAAAAY
Armour affects gameplay?
wooot
Wow...
I think so, you buy it and such
With your rank
LOL
Ive only played one game so i cant say much. Id have to ask my bro
armor does NOT affect gameplay
Hmm
>Halo >Armour makes you stronger
Dohoho
No.
armour variations*
Perhaps its the classes.
:D
when you rank up you get spartan points that you unlock weapons and armor abilities, tactical/Support uppgrades with
JAAYYYYSSSSONNNN
So, wouldnt that be an advantage over new players?
Wait, what is this on stream?
not that much its just custom loadouts there are always fully kitted loadouts available
the new assins creed RaveBrony
RaveBrony: Two Best Friends Play Assassin's Creed 3
Hmm, i see. and Ah, never played Assassin's Creed :L
naturesfury is it good

alexxm: yes its very good though i havent finished it yet
RaveBrony, neither have I. It's not like I'm against it, or anything.

Sandy took away my colors :'(
What are Twinkies?
Not sure if want them over here then, Scoot-Scootaloo.
OH NO, it's Bear Grylls all over again :D

Now imagine they were edible...

Did any of the Beatles die?
DinkyDoo: :| are you serious
Music, eh. For some reason I keep listening "Heart of the Rainbow" of Freedom Call's "Crystal Empire" lately. Must have to do with the way they name things...
MadSurge: What? I don't know anything about these people!!
I don't know who the Beatles are.. please don't kill me... o_o
DinkyDoo
DinkyDoo: I weep for this generation

Dont worry DinkyDoo, i hardy know them at all. Didnt really care for them that much
RaveBrony: He’s gone
=_(\
I don't care whether people like them or not, but having never heard of them before?
wat
^
I only heard about the group about a year ago :L
That's like never having heard of Jesus, they're probably as well known
And another one goes down.
I only knew 1 guy from it :D
Which?
*thar
i only know the beatles are a band and nothing more *slowly backs away*
The guy with the round glasses, a friend of mine would make fun of me for having glasses that look similar =_=
Snow|TF2: Atleast you've heard about them.
^
Snow|TF2: I bet you would recognize some of their songs if you were specifically told they wrote it
Same with me MadSurge
RaveBrony: you like raves, but you heard about the Beatles :D
Couldn't name you any, but I'd recognise a fair number
MadSurge: Hmm?
MadSurge: i dont think so :\
Snow|TF2: Most likely you would
MadSurge: Help – He needs somebody – Help – Not just anybody – Help – You know he needs someone.
The number of times ther songs are used in adverts
All the time
It's impossible not to recognise any
11,01Hmm.
Snow|TF2: their songs have been used everywhere
That guy! With the glasses!
RaveBrony: his name is John Lennon
Doug Walker? Where?!
SirGanjalf: Ikr :D
Ah

I love pinkie pie, she is hilarious :D
outdoor fuckin starts today
"Now i have seen everything."
How could there ever be too many pinkie pies?
Its a lie I say
Also incoming MLP FiM movie
The two parter reeked of it
Barb|MyLilPseudonym: there never is enough Pinkie Pie. Like dakka
Maybe that is just me.
Kinda random, but I think you should be kicked for referencing RWJ
i didnta
i qouted engineer.
RWJ?
No, I can't take more "Well, there have been hints that X is gonna happen" in this FanDom >.<
Native-Warrior: Good thing you are not a mod around here
You would kick some one for yawning
Lil_B: :D
/me yawns
:o
KICK
Yawning isnt an RWJ reference
Or is it?
there wont be enough CYANIDE PILLS to hold too many Pinkie Pies
a window licking fox is.
FUCK YOU
Are you talking about "Now I have seen everything"?
Yeah, but it is a "Native-Warrior has a power trip" reference.
You used to be cool man
Native-Warrior: why me!?
Abby Road :P
What happened to you!!
Not you mate
you're cool.
I'm gonna get pants on
Dark92Enigma not even multiple universes can handle multiple pinkie pies
o_o
Native-Warrior: oh, i knew it...who then?
Snow
Please. No pants
Dark92Enigma: cyanide is not effective on a cartoon horsie :D
like i quoted
Deacon tormorow will tell us if thats true
We don't believe in pants
"now i have seen everything."
"I fear no man...but that thing.... it scares me"
That's hardly an RWJ original.
MadSurge: you're right :D
I just realised I said "RWJ" and "original" in the same sentence.
btw, who is streaming? I see no Desktop Ponies to get any indications!
:D
Besides, why hurt Pinkie?
Lil_B: Scoot-Scootaloo is
?
ah thanks MadSurge
alloo SWAG
SWAG: No.
WHo is this dude with the glasses? It looks like Matt from Two best Friends Play
HWY
aaaaaaaaaaaaand whats on the stream?
i mean hey
Snow beatles documentry
a beatles documentary
Hi
am I wrong?
PETE BEST IS BEST PONY
BUT this is a BRINtstate i dont get it
Native-Warrior: Wouldn't know, never seen what Matt looks like.
._.
Look on Google
SWAG: Read the FAQ.
and Rules
actually he looks more like Lee Tockar
Bronystate: a place where i learn more then when im in school.
I will always accept the Beatles as an awesome Group, but I really Dislike almost all of their songs >.<
and that is 100% the truth
Lee Tockar anypony?
05aaand done
Welcome back Wrek ^^
Gross
05finally done with this image, t'was hell to make :|
05even if its so simple
... My mind really... REALLLY needs to get out of the gutter
I can make anything pervy
im curious now, can we see Wrek?
Its bad
Hello
hello Wrek :)
05i can PM you it casue i cant link it here
oh my

05no
I'd like to see it too Wreky
I think the few songs I like are "Come Together" and "Revolution 9"
pm me then
thats ok Wrek :P
Not even on your dA? Now I'm curious.
^
Then PM right away Wrek!
giggity
Huh, didn't think you drew NSFW Wrek.
05blame ghosties
Really?
Huh.
05nah, its sumis fault
from a judging vieuw, it looks great Wrek!
Wrek: O.O
view*
I blame the entirety of the Brony fandom Wrek
They corrupted you.
Would the Beatles music have been possible without marijuana or LSD?
With ponies and porn
Wrek, could you Pm the link to me?
Barb|MyLilPseudonym: I blame reality for requiring money.
Native-Warrior: does it matter?
05im just happy my majority of images are still good SFW ones
Idk
Barb|MyLilPseudonym: dont blame them, blame the ffing R34 of the internet.
^
Snow: In that case, blame human nature.
05but yeah
05very simple
Human nature is such a douche.
Eh. Well I would just hate to see the stigma of furries transfer to the bronies
>implying that bronies aren't responsible for virutally all the pony R34
Chum is fum
and it probably will
05color and outline
in due time
05couldnt be arsed to make it more detailed
Wrek was the Critic I posted for your Agend RD Picture ok?
Chum is fum ._.
05it was very very short for a critique
porn is bad guys
it corrupts
young minds
From what's been said, I'm assuming this is a request on your Sumi picture.
05chekc the other one made for same image
05but i appreciate it nonetheless
Hanako unless the youth in question is corrupted in the first place
lolwut?
Hanako: you shouldve told me 7 years ago when i discoverd the internet.
Hanako: eh nah,its just human nature
Okay. R34 is okay for a show like... saaaaayy.... Tenchi Muyo or something like that.
okay
all three of you
Little kids aint gona even know it
I am joking
jesus
Wrek oh, ok, when I saw it, there was no Critique at all, will check it later :)
what sprunkls said :U
But you search on Youtube for pony any more and you get r34 videos
Hanako: and i awnserd with a joke on your joke xD
or at least things that link to it
Yep?
Its really sad
Hanako ah, sometimes it's really ard to read sarcasm :\

Snout is a portruding nose and mouth, a muzzle is a portruding part of the face including nouse and mouth. Horses and dogs are described with muzzle, never snout
MadSurge: cuddly/mishia. the school prevents the commands from working

I hope everybody saw S3 opening
08,01hehehehe
G-Major? as in TC-Electronic?
08,01i have new socks! \o/
woo
Yay?
Are they knee socks?
08,01they're thermally insulating and have this gorgeous fluffy material on the inside
Socks
08,01so fucking comfy!
The best parts of socks? Taking them off-- aaahh delicious
I love the giddy up song.
05you missed new art
08,01Everlasting_Joy: hopefully
05linked in pm
08,01Wrek: i got a glimpse of it earlier, but it was too NSFW to view in the lab
It's my space....you can't have it.
o_e
Balloon Party isn't on Bandcamp anymore?
aaaw really? we glad i got it when i did :D
08,01AttackWithHugs: i'm very good friends with Lavender Harmony from Balloon Party
08,01i've known her for about 5 years
08,01i think we may have slept together
Has ask princess Molestia been banned from TUMBLER?!
O_o
Vordox, no. I was on there the other day
AttackWithHugs: Check again
I don't think it was, at least
brb
Vordox: whoa...what!?
/me flips a table "Noooo, i loved hat tumblr"
there's something going on at tumblr
*that
because of their tagging system, tagging something nsfw doesn't really work
08,01huh
at least, that's th reasoning I heard
08,01John Joseco draws Ask Princess Molestia, right?
05dont act so suprised
so they wanted to start writing NSFWpony NSFWTwilight etc
08,01i'll ask him what happened
JJ yeah
05tumblr doesnt allow overly sexual tumblrs
05it was a matter of time
^
Wrek: So?
08,01but it wasn't overly sexual... well, not explicitly sexual
Wrek: It's not SHOWING anything sexual
Wrek: still, i thought it was funny...and not thaaat bad DX
It's PEOPLE who make it sexual =P
05neither did I
It's not explicit, but it is sexual
05i didnt midn it at all
05but still
It wasn't as explicit as some other tumblrs
I don't know tumblrs rules
05you cant really be suprised
other tumblrs vanish every day
05at it
Inb4 10000+ fans hatebombs tumbler
Maybe enough people complained about it, illegitametly or not.
Vordox He has over 20k I believe
Wrek: I am, cause APM was a fun comic, with perverted nature, but it never showed ANYTHING sexual
Perverted, yes, Sexual, no, not even close.
That's enough to get you blocked by a sfw rule
why did I get kicked oO
05Vordox: i KNOW
05but really
05its tumblr
Wrek: It's haters
hey
no, tumblr has been doing cleanouts for a while
Or people who thinks it's sexual, when it's perverted. ._.
05how very paranoid of you
especially, if you have foalcon or implied foalcon, they will take it down
perverted is inheritly sexual
It is highly likely there is a group of individuals reporting NSFW blogs.
even if it is humour and not pornographic, it is nsfw
"Omg I saw a chair that looked like a dildo! OMG CLOASE THAT SEX STORRREE" <--- This happens trust me. :P
I've seen Doxy go down, Smitty and some others.
well this sucks but i'll get over it eventually...and JJ will do something about it...maybe XD
They should do it on another blog-service that allows their material
DashWithRainbows: I actually know something about that. Its been investigated. Mind if I link it to you?
whining about this is just silly
Sure, PM me.
(not that you are whining, but some artists were)
http://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/community
OMCBRONIESIJUSTSAWRAINBOWDASHONHOTTOPIC'SHOTMINUTE!
NSFW is allowed if it is flagged
05sad to see him loose ald the messages and followers
pony_3290: Now take a breathe and say it cally?
05but its not that hard to mkae another tumblr
calmy*
Hope he hass all that art backed up someplace
05and all the followers probably know its down, follow JJ, will fidn out what the potential new one is and jsut follow
05again
I saw Rainbow Dash on hot topic's hot minute
But please don't use Tumblr's Upload Video feature to host any sexually explicit videos. We're not in the business of profiting from adult-oriented videos and hosting this stuff is fucking expensive
tumblr is funny in their wording
I'm sure there's lot of NSFW tumblrs out there but it seems the pony ones are the ones being taken down
I think more are being, but I'm not sure
AttackWithHugs: That wouldn't surprise me.
Then again, I haven't really kept up with a lot of them so...*shrug*
there are trolls, obviously
AttackWithHugs: I don't care about pony sex anyway :|
Ponys want to feel good too ;__;
Or they could have gotten JJ's info somehow and told Tumblr to delete the blog
MadSurge: Since when has APM been anything with sex?(Like... 3/10 of a post is perverted, rest is just fun
Rainbow Dash is on Hot Topic's Hot Minute
Vivix: not in front of me though :D
hehehe
HECK, even that contest they just had was GREAT fun with no perversion
Vordox, the Gamer Luna one?
AttackWithHugs: That one especially. :(
I liked those. They were awesome.
Well, if the blog was tagged as NSFW in the settings, this shouldn't ahve happened, but contests can get you delted as-well
"Unauthorized contests, sweepstakes" etc
Vivix: Maybe infringement?
Because it's now Ask Princess Molestia + Gamer Luna
Not sent from Hasbro, but from haters. :P or arseholes
There was no actual prize except recognition though.
Infringement and TM is reaaaally copmlicateed, so I won't go into that, don't understand it
Well, that I know of.
And speaking of things deleted, I don't see Balloon Party on Bandcamp.
I don't think there was a price either
Welp, time to torrent it
Oh, Sombra. <3
Let's see, I have uTorrent, mIRC, Avast, Skype
Still need CCleaner, ASC, Spybot, PowerISO and something else
Steam.
Oh yeah, that too
Hmmm, I need to think of a couple names for 2 bases for a game I'm playing.
Vordox: :D
Any suggestions?
And I ALWAYS forget my Steam password.
DashWithRainbows: Dogfort and Catfort.
Lawls.
DashWithRainbows: Fort Loadsamoney
DashWithRainbows: Carpmane and Hoofers?
Lookin' for something somewhat pony related.
DashWithRainbows: Fort RainbowDosh
muney.
Princess Luna, Celestia, Princess Cadence and Chrysalis are already being used.
DashWithRainbows: Canterlot and Crystal Empire.
^
Perfect.
Well, Canterlot can be my main base :P
WinRAR and 7zip
08,01i'd use Queen Chrysalis
08,01if you know what i mean
oh my~
God damn it XD
08,01Vordox: not heard anything yet; he's away at the moment
08,01i'll let you know when he responds
Oh wait, Queen Chrysalis does fit.
08,01no problem, hombre
/me 08,01has no idea what hombre even means
