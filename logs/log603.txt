USE THE JAR OF DIRT
Fun fact: the term Starboard came from the notion that the right hand side of the ship always faced the stars when traveling along the African coast. The term port was coined, likewise, based off the notion that the left hand side faced the ports at shore.
Stop blowin' holes in my Kraken!!!
