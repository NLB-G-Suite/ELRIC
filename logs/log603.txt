MIssShizu: Dat reference...
Then you can be really joinin' the crew
Coral man knows all
13but the whole "there must be a captain" thing...
13they never explain that
Barnacle Man, Barnacle Man, his body is an entire barnacle, man.
swabie_maid_sprinkle: I was wrong sorry mate.
Permission to be promoted to Lookout!! Pweeeease :$
Well, I guess I should consider myself a prisoner of the Nittany Pirates.
that guy... has alot of muscles
Yay

/me 13plays accordion
I think he wants her naked
Barnacle man hates octopus man
Not sure though
nothing it is!
MissShizu: Dutchman ferries souls to the afterlife, the dutchman must have a captain to do that
Admiral_Otakon: actually it looks like that scroll is false
Nothing whatsoever to do with me.
a dress or nothing
Toliver_Hazard_Perry, still no match ofr person man
Shizu: Davy Jones is supposed to be guiding souls to the other side. That's his job. But he's been abandoning it.
Guybrush_Threepwood: overboard
13well yes
Admiral_Otakon: the bok of google says its swabbie
13and for that he becomes octopus man
:D
your fiancee is stuck on the ship of an evil sea monster
/me smells funny
great comeback
swabie_maid_sprinkle: well the bok must be right then :P
13but it sure seems the souls make it to the other side fine on their own
MissShizu: some would consider that aplus :S
13sure an escort would make it a more pleasant trip
Dat crate of Rum.
mah heart
Oh Pintel and Raggeti
Shizu: Well that's because there are plot holes in this script that you could sail a ship through.
You so silly
Admiral_Otakon: I fixed it, Admiral!
hide the rum
Captain_Maid_Discord: the storm is right on us sir!
08,01there's a few chests i wouldn't mind posessing.
swabbie_maid_sprinkl: good man, back to your duties :)
Norrington has increased his Piratey swagger = Alot
13the dock they're standing on is moving quite a lot, i forget if they said norrington's hurl over the side was legitimate or not
Admiral_Otakon: Yes, Admiral!
BLUH
MissShizu: I think legit
In the Lego Game the plot point of the compass was brought up in the first movie
08,01Admiral_Otakon: you stop that!
Unique eunuch named Eunice
08,01Admiral_Otakon: in *your* endo.

meeeehhh
Dat goat
thats your room mante
MissShizu: what's the gag?
Toliver_Hazard_Perry: the Spider is best eunuch
13that sword also running gag
the sword too?
13Admiral_Otakon: that the goat is in silly situations each movie
0,14I expect better behavior from Adirals
isn't that norrigntons sword?
MissShizu: oh
0,14*Admirals
13might just be this one and #3
0,14so cut that out, or I'll demote ye lot
Aaaaand how did they find that out?
13next movie one of the jack clones is inching closer to the goat in the locker
MissShizu: also achekov's gun, brick joke, overly long gag sword
FirstMaid_Cratorkid: Aye, but is he unique?
people in wigs cannot be trusted
MissShizu, :'(
Tortuga is a pirate port, their redcoats would stick out like sore thumbs. >_>
Toliver_Hazard_Perry: why of course
heyaaa everypony!
he bald
AdmiralSaxy: ...but im the only one here that knows how to sail...
So how the hell did they get this information so fast?
hai Zanon
08,01AdmiralSaxy: pulling rank? I see you like being on top...
Ouch
13well, the biggest plot hole of all is the role of the EITC in the films... the "east indies" are kind of the OTHER DIRECTION from europe...
how does that guy have so much power?
hey Zanon , welcome to the maid pirates life
Captain_Maid_Discord: *wakes up from AFK napping* sorry capn', i was tired :(
CriticKitten they read the script
aye
Dramatic dice
/me plays liar dice with Admiral_Otakon
dat game
/me joins the game
dis game
never place dice with a pufferfish man
13but they've acknowledged this is an alternate universe where all the sea tales are true, so i guess the company could overrule royal authority
I listen to this explanation and I still don't get it...
I actually have that dice game. Little brother got it for his birthday.
well MissShizu they did do trading into the WEST indies as well iirc
He got balls
^
here comes the champ
I CHALLENGE Captain_Maid_Discord
balls of steal
Watch out we got a badass here
challenging a man with all the chips?
Good hearing.
not smart
Davy Jones: Ping?
MissShizu: you forget beckett is alord so he's some what high up
13liar's dice here is of course a real game... while they were location scouting in peru they came across it and decided to make it a minor plot point
hey guys. imma marshall :)
I should make an OC for myself...
Zanon Aaaaaaaaaagggggghhhh!!
.
hehe
an eternity of servitude
my OC is odd. it's unique, to say the least
MissShivu, I learned of Liars die from Red Dead Redemption
you're better off challenging Magneto or Chitti to a game of dice, (provided the dice are metal)
0,14ah, Liar's Dice, fun game in RDR

0,14oh hey, Dken2021
Hi dken!

hi Dken2021

0,14it's a game where bluffing plays a big role
its been a while
OTL
Dafuq
AdmiralSaxy: thus the term "Liar's Dice"
PolyYoutube who is this guy who dares to do that?!
lionfish man?
HOLY SHIT he's ugly
0,14yep
o_o
brb need a drink you crazy lot
13i'd have to go back and watch but i'm pretty sure will had a correct call at the end before bootstrap made his impossible wager
I actually know the rules to Liar's Dice.
Guybrush, more likely :3
sneak increased to 5
Ah, so it's basically Liar's Cards but with dice. Should have guessed really.
dat upright sleeping
13such that if jones had called will a liar he would himself have lost
alrigt, back to cabin boy dsuties
Shizu: I looked. Jones was actually right. Will was one too high.
11,01Bronysith: To what?
Balls
Use chop sticks!
13ah
MissShizu: ive seen this alot , will had the winnig call
the adventures of
MissShizu: Dat ..."Irony"?
I'be played Liar's Dice in Red Ded Redemption
13bummer
CABIN BOOOOOOY
I bet he dreams of ponies
Captain_Maid_Discord: that was a long wait for a reply...nevermind
dem tentacles
this is getting silly
08,01fun fact: you can't actually sleep sitting down
you rang?
08,01it's impossibly
08,01*impossible
11,01Bronysith: I was AFK.
13will is moving the pins in completely empty space, the tentacles were of course added later
11,01At that scene.
Captain_Maid_Discord: mmmk
Davy Jones. There is nothing you have which I cannot take away.
13but there's not even reference points, he's just moving where he thinks tentacles would be
08,01sitting up, i mean
13animation crew put them to match
Jones had 4 of the fives, Will had 3 more, so Jones was actually dead on.
I love these old relics. <3
dat music
08,01if you're have a backrest to lean on, you can
Wonderful Music and all
o_o
Which makes me think he cheated. >_>
ether these tentacöes are amazingly heavy, or this organs keys are well oiled...
08,01but your brain shuts off most of your motor cortex while you sleep
while sitting up
ah
nevermind then
(how else would he instantly know Will had lost? >_>)
13all your muscles relax before going into sleep paralysis
yeah with backrests
/me 08,01nuzzles Captain_Maid_Discord
XD
Well, sometimes I have spasms when I sleep.
13so you can't fall asleep in any position where you have to hold a muscle rigid
Bronysith: yeah i know :p
MissShizu: Self compression of the body
I've woken up in sleep paralysis before :S
08,01MissShizu: aye, this
PolyYoutube: i hate waking up in sleep paralysis
oh god, I hate sleep paralysis, so creepy
dat promise
PolyYoutube: so scary
Captain_Maid_Discord: May i have some popcorn? im giving it out to thee' crew thats down in the lower deck watchin' jack sparrow
0,14horrible, innit, PolyYoutube
0,14?
AdmiralSaxy: it is very nightmarish
what's sleep paralysis?
13and trust me, if you're trying to focus on falling asleep, it's practically impossible to find one of those every-muscle-is-relaxed positions
Bronysith: Same here. Makes it hard to wake up.
11,01Firstmate_Maid_Angel: Go right ahead.
Lord Cutler Baguette.
13has to be natural most of the time
It's bloody annoying, not being able to move even though you're awake :|
I HATE sleep paralysis o_o
MarshallInstrumental it's where you want to wake up, but you can't
MissShizu: I've done some amazing things then
Captain_Maid_Discord: thanks for the permisson cap
Sleep paralysis?
13which makes wake induced lucid dreaming a pain in the flank..
<--- Has a reputation of being able to sleep anywhere, EVERYWHERE:
sleep paralysis is noisy
Sleep paralysis?
wow. is that normal? i have that every day
TO MANY CAPTAINS AND FIRST MATES
Dafuq is sleep paralysis
I've not had sleep paralysis for a while.
Not enough Fleet Admirals
thankfully, haven't gotten sleep paralysis in a few years
13basically when you're sleeping, your brain locks all your muscles to prevent you from hurting yourself during a dream
11,01She traded three dresses for that piece of paper.
sleep paralysis happens to me every day, i got used to it. didn't know it had a name
MissShizu: then how come I toss and turn?
Captain_Maid_Discord: and?
dat persuasion
Sleep paralasys is that thing that stopps you from moving in ur slep
Ooooh
13it might be only during a near dream phase
cockblock...
the thing is, the EIC controls the money, which in turn controls many many things, including countries and kings
^^
Oh damn :D
THE POWER OF LOVE IS A CURIOUS THING
It's where you wake up but your body is still asleep, barrelguy_cachi01. And you can't move your body even though you're awake.
11,01And what?
13leaving enough of that just barely awake period for you to adjust position, but in between dreams were you wouldn't remember
MAKES ONE MAN CRY
<--- Has one of the best things sleeping position, on 2 lines of ropes.
Old fun times...
MAKES ANOTHER MAN SING
MissShizu: sleep paralasis must be ficky as hell seein g as how one can have jolt waking nightmares where you end up bolting upright
hm, Commodorrington's wig is gone.
Polytube dafuuuuuuuuuq?
BrigomanFan: dat song
Ok everypony of Captain_Maid_Discord's, and Capntain Dark nignma's crew, FREE POPCORN TIME *holds out tons of bags* who wants some <3
Uh oh
13like me, i usually tru to fall asleep on my right side, but every single morning i wake up on my left in the exact same slightly curled up position
I've experienced it before and it's goddamned annoying :|
11,01It be fine popcorn.
/me steals the popcorn for his crew
Meow
MissShizu, hugging a pillow or blanket? :p
13both

13i need a body pillow... and a lighter blanket..

Arrr, it'd be fine popcorn indeed. I be willin' to share I be!
/me becomes MissShizu
*s body Pillow
Und now i must draw MissShizu curled up sleeping adorably :3
13part that, part it fills up space for me to relax easier on
/me 11,01gives MissShizu a blanket
It's worse than worse
This Oliver Hazard Perry name is ling
i have a special pillow shaped like a V that's really comfortable. idk if it does anything special but it's comfy :)
*long*
Firstmate_Maid_Angel, I'm not really a member of Captain_Maid_Discord's crew, I'm just a drifter who had the audacity to try swabbing his deck. I'm nothing but a prisoner.
13i wake up on my left side every morning, but i've tried for months and months to find that position on my way to sleep, and can't do it
Ello everyone
which one is this? dead man's chest?
UNLEASH THE KRAAAKEEEEN
but I agree, MissShizu needs a body pillow
Captain_Michael_Jone: *assults with a baseballbat* How dare ye! You could at least say ello' to our leader :)

11,01You like MissShizu?
13but the one thing i remember from commentary is you'll notice when the soundtrack gets going it sounds like they have electric guitars or some kind of synth going, but it's all orchestra
It's not working! :O
It isn't worth the consequenses. It's all fun and games unless I change my nick to something that's not on Tovler's ignore list.

So there's a Kraken? Tame him and name him Sarume!
dammit my chat derped

Was there a hint of Sherlock Holmes theme right now?
13iirc they were about to settle on 'krayken' until they realized that 99% of people that know of krakens would pronounce it 'crack-en'
Vera Cruz is in Mexico, between Villa Hermossa and Tampico
It's Avatar and Uhvatar all over again
13so kraken won

In the Lego game this takes place ON THE THIRD LEVEL OF THE SECOND MOVIE

Indeed
So I understand that Davy jones can't set foot on land, but what would happen if he tried? Would he pass through it, or maybe bounce off like a trampoline?

Remember in Epic Movie when Captain Jack Swallows ends the film with killing the heroes with that giant wheel thing?
Dat fail
Meanwhile in the forest
BrigomanFan: yes it is from this
13i think mostly the directors were talking about how this sequence was them throwing in all the swordfighting scenarios they always wanted
MissShizu: interesting how they can run so fast with flippers?
MissShizu obviousle these guys wanted to help her, these swords are lighter than the chest
This series has the absolute best fight scenes ever
I know, Just saying I liked that he ended the film like that
BrigomanFan: Why would you remind us that movie exists?
Dat camera
wat?
weeeeeeeee
It really does look like a themepark ride.
Admiral_Otakon, ...I know.
11,01*klank*

Navigator_magmablock: well some great ones that is for sure

Unfortunately, the Dutchman is a chaser and is built for forward firing capability.
my ship is the best ship
Gunman_somuchpony more like gatling cannon
Gatling cannons. Too bad that makes no sense. :D
Meanwhile: so if they manage to get behind it broadside?
I 'VE HAD IT WITH THIS MOTHERBUCKING HOLES

CriticKitten it makes sense... but it makes no sense that someone actually made these Xd

KRAKEN

huzzah!
/me releases the kraken upon the black pearl
nope.avi
THE WHIPPINGS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL MORALE IMPROVES
lol short guy
the kraken approches
Derp
Admiral_Otakon: In the event you end up behind the Dutchman I advise turning around and fleeing. Broadsides are most effective when you're also in range of a broadside. More space to hit.
not the precious dirt!~
yup, empty
:O
No heart. :D
so THIS time, the kraken is going to attack the Pearl?
Troll
dumbass
RELEASE YAPLAP!
the dirt is ruined

Captain_Striker a kraken
Round 1 goes to the Black Pearl
11,01But they didn't hit anything vital.
USE THE JAR OF DIRT
Fun fact: the term Starboard came from the notion that the right hand side of the ship always faced the stars when traveling along the African coast. The term port was coined, likewise, based off the notion that the left hand side faced the ports at shore.
Stop blowin' holes in my Kraken!!!
U MAD BRO
AdmiralSaxy: xD

He reached that boat, saw the bottle the heart was in, and snitched it then.
Swamp people!
Cypresswolf I won't say anything for the sake of the people here who haven't seen it, but it follows the third movie. Besides, the fact that the Black Pearl was "indisposed" in the fourth movie kind of makes its prequel status impossible.

Oh yeah, this is another ride reference
IT'S ZECORA!
I would NOT stand in that swamp
dat swamp
WAIT
Ill have some Striker

Hi Zecora!

11,01I'll have to restart stream for that.

Just try and mess around with your sound isetting
No
13this song is not well encoded

MissShizu: so i hear your looking for pony pirate pics?
Smooze wil kill all

11,01Probably VAC.
I hear a fair bit of crackle mysdelf. But I'm old so everything sounds like that to me.
11,01Wait.
11,01Even my laptop streams Vordox?
NOW I HEAR THE CRACKELING
13assuming comcast plays along

MINAS TIRITH!!
Shizuka making more building ?
13ja, staging to build some riven huts now
11,01If it's something new, it may be my grandmother's internet. If not, it's VAC or FMLE settings.
I assume FMLE
13ping probably won't be good... dunno if the zipper elevators will work for anyone but me
But I do not know what Vac is
DERPY

13i hear stream compression, around the treble a little
13but not cracking
I dont know...
i have headphones and i hear it just fine
Shizuka: glad i got that second one to you, since Derpibooru just went down

Spectrum_Indy: Careful resizing :P

Shizuka: Flagged it for?
13misleading thumbnail
I like how Cold Front has the CANON Equestria map in 8 bit form in front o him
13it's a guy rambling and being a jackass
Kandarihu|MaidsMop Just a guess
knew it
/me clicks
Shizuka: Oh, gee.. Those peps. ._.
Shizuka: put in tags like "Pony, friendship is magic" etc etc
well since he's a partner, doubt they'll remove the video
That's related to your video
HECK put in the names even
That should help out with the suggested links
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpza85lLpE VINTAGE NOSTALGIA CRITIC
Daygon did it
It's your "Movie" and "night" that caused the links to be show like that :P
I DID NOTHING!!!
I swear, if any of his family sees what he left on the stream, it might be a family emergency yet.
00,10so uh, what's the delay?
so whats the deal with aeroplane food?
13oh if you wrap in quotes it'll make one tag
Sumica: Stuff with Nittany. Do not know why
11,01Terribly sorry everyone.

otakon: yes it is
"Anything goes" in chinese, wat?
In the first Five Minutes no les
11,01Kandarihu|MaidsMop: I told my grandmother I was streaming a movie to a website. She got an attitude like I was blowing her off.

..GodfuckingdammitWillie.
Spectrum_Indy: no it's not, last crusade it
/me puts Daygon in a skirt
I. Hate. You.
08,01i can't fathom how it was actually even released

what's this Screwattack and EQD playing TF2 togwther?
VERY fun
What?
/me puts Daygon in a school girl outfit
WELCOME TO FALLOUT
It's okay, to not like things. It's okay, but don't be a jerk about it. It's okay, to not like things... don't be a jerk about the things you don't like.
otakon: Temple of Doom came out in 1984. Last Crusade was 1989. >_>
WHERE DID THE STAGE CAME FROM, IT'S YOUR GUESS <------------- ?
That's an interesting font they're using.
We've been Shanghai'd
Captain_Maid_Discord: hey any chance we can watch the Nostalgia Critic Temple of Doom review afterwards?
HA! Fault on you, I look sexy in this outfit.
11,01She also think that you're depressed because you're not meeting people?
otakon: That makes it definitely second. It's chronologically the first, though.
11,01otakon: Yes.
otakon Captain_Maid_Discord YES
Kandarihu_MaidsMop where was Twi when star wars prequels
YES YES YES
08,01it's funny, because this film is completely insulting to India... but it's the first part of his fucking name!
Captain_Maid_Discord: awesome
Indy suited up

11,01Jokes on Jones. He was never originally poisoned. He just drank new poison thought.
Oh, now _I_ heard the Wilhelm scream.
Sort Round is like Ewoks - people even like him, or hate him. Willie is like Jar Jar...
11,01*though

Suddenly Fedora
And now they get killed on the plane....oh wait that would make sense.
All is right in the world now
The end :3
Shaddap, Willie
THANK YOU, JONES.
Crimson_Phoenix, a Wilhelm scream is an iconic scream that starts low and changes to a higher pitch mid-scream.
OWNED
11,01What happened to the lady in the first movie?
Dead
Nittany_Discord: "Removed"
This is a prequal
Nittany: Prequel.
THAT'S OUR JONES, EVERYPONY
dat Great Wall
Giving birth
Kandarihu, like a aaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAA
Such a strong female character.
she was in the second and died
we'll assume she was put on a bus
where`s shortround?
Really this is a prequal?
Dead
Crimson_Phoenix, yeah, I guess that's like it.
XylemTube: no
RED LINE TRAVELING AGAIN!!
SHORT ROUND IS DEAD
But mor like aaaaAAAAH
Um...SHoot them?
IT'S A TRAP
Uh.
0,14the chronoligical order is 2, 1, 3 and 4
13but ja if anypony wants to join me..
11,01Toilet dump.
...
The plane is bleeding:O
They're all asleep, just shoot them.
Not a prequel, guys. It takes place afterwards.
What kind of plane has a feature like that?
Heh heh heh heeeeh
What would be the point of a fuel dump?
11,01Dumping those fluids.
Seems rather expensive to crash a plane just to kill them. You could just shoot them.
13to guarantee they crash
And they sleep
LAL
Barbetos, kill things
Why do they not shoot them...................plot issues
"See ya"
what would be the point of jumping out in the middle of the himalaya's?
Scootaloos' gone apeshit
/me dumps chats fuel
destory a plane, or kill them in their sleep?
uh oh
We gona crash!!
Denied
INB4 EPIC SCREAM
Yeah those two pilots are dead in the snow.
DOLL
THEY JUMPED OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GODDAMN MOUNTAINS
HA KID
11,01Why is she wearing boy clothes?
Steering wheels on a plane.

Stupid Doll, you make look movie bad:[

But i died
Fuuuuuuuuuu
dat sw sound

I have a bad feeling about this
Welp
/me chat's engine dies
Oh, Damn, you're right, it is a prequel.
"we're all counting on you. Good Luck"
=D
Ya think
This is not how planes work BTW
No moar parachute!
So Lao Che just killed two of his own pilots and destroyed not only one of his planes but the cargo it was carrying.
Save the watermelons!
/me WE'RE NOT SINKING.........WE'RE CRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
little asain kid
SHUT UP WILLIE
Hey can I get an opinion? Do you consider it weird to go to see a movie on your own?
Damn Lao Che is a bastard
Crashiiiinggg
She is so bad
My ears hurts of her
god I love that line
I keep thinking of Stewie when she does that
Myth proven!
THe original Nuke the Fridge
otakon: all that just to avoid paying the doctor.
ts a taco!
Shaddaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap!
So ded
NO THIS SCOOTALOOS!!!
Fuck physics
Mythbusters proved this right BTW
THis is a horrible idea....
Nyst: eeyup I think Lao Che should have just payed him
Obsidian: Actually the Mythbusters proved that it works.
NOT THE SCOOTALOOS!!!
FUCK YO PLANE NIGGA
no nonononononononononononononononononononononononono
TemplemanFan: They can do that? :o
dat green screen effect
note how that was all in one shot
How lucky that he didn't land on those rocks
No Fuel = Plane explodes on impact.
I guess it could be a parachute
have no fuel ... big explosion ...
i dont trust mythbusters
HA
11,01They had dynamite.
Kandarihu it was made of explodium
So how does it work then? Does it slow down because it's wide? Does the snow absorb the shock?
LOL
AT LEAST IT'S NOT NUKING THE FRIDGE
^
another happy landing
DAMN THEY GUYS ARE AWESOME
RaveBrony, you'll fracture a few bones but it's safer than a freefall
diddutz_ michael bay
Nyst: Most likely? Drag from being so wide.
Im just in time for the Temple of Doom
wow, she's a whiney one
We ALL hate you woman
dat pitch drop
Nyst: It works as a large parachute
Shut up Willie
TemplemanFan: Cool :D
I HATE YOU TOO WILLIE!
AND I HATE YOU WILLIE
Nuking the fridge < jumping the shark
I doubt Mythbusters is going to test out the fridge myth anytime soon.
It's light and wide, so it functions like a parachute.
When she said you it was deep like hell
So do I.
and I hate *deep voice* YOU
Nyst: It grabs the air and slows don
down
haha shes named after a penis
Willie - female Francis, but much more annoying
Nyst because it's unrealistically impossible?
Mythbusters did do the fridge myth
Thanks CriticKitten, Sagas.
Adventure_Striker: how could they?
Adventure_Striker: they got a nuke?
so... what is this?
India Jones
11,01Suddenly, stopped.
So is it weird to go see a movie in theatre on your own?
Nyst: AWESOME
So yeah, as bad as people try to make that scene sound, it actually WORKS. It's been tested and proven. The nuke-the-fridge? We don't need to test that, pretty safe to say it's bullshit.
hai TWOLOT , tekmple of doom
they had explosives
Indian Doc Brown
cratorkid: more compromises probably
DOC BROWN!!!!!!!!!!
88 MILES PER HOUR
Brown Doc Brown
oh ok.
GREAT SCOTT!

This is heavy!
Doc is that you?
THIS IS HEAVY, DOC
Because I did today and my parent cant seem to fathom why somebody would do that
AU Doc Brown
I WAS INDIAN TODAY
Suddenly India Marty McFly
love the daring do
Come this way, Doctor Jones. You're gonna see some serious shit.
Daring Do gives no bucks
LOOK AT HER
Looks like Doc gone back in time to 1935 Indua
They time travel in a basket
=D
*India
11,01sagas: Are you yound?
Everything that happened to this point is no longer relevant to the movie.
what is she saying?
ythbusters make too many compromises to actually prove anything
White people are GODS in India
That is sad
sagas I've done that several times, but probably because people expect to have a group for outings
Nittany_Discord: Do you mean young? If so, yes
Daygon Please get our sons back
Nyst it served its purpose, in that it proves that Dr. Jones is STILL bad ass.
creepy
Daygon according to the plot, that is
No, they're just begging for money Shooeie
11,01sagas: They're just worried about you.
sagas, I don't see anything out of the ordinary about that. Maybe there's some extenuating circumstances.
i have no idea what's going on
Bat poooooooo
What would they do with money?
guano?
Barbetos: true. And they did it in the first movie too (and better imo)
SHUT UP WILLIE
11,01Guano?
WHAT A BITCH
Kandarihu: none than I can think of....
o.O That was some Thunder I just heard

Obsidian: to the contrary, she doesnt want to eat their food because they dont have much of it
Nittany_Discord: I go to the movie on my own every one or two weeks and I enjoy it. I see nothing wrong
It's nyasty. Excuse me?! Do you have any chipotle ranch dressing?

11,01sagas: They're just worried you'll get hurt if you're alone.

Nittany_Discord: Im 17. I dont think thats gonna happen...

TemplemanFan: Maybe cause LEGOs don't have wrinkles
Where was Indian Doc Brown when the Indian Terminator attacked?
I didnt know people still talked in here :o
Beinga LEGO person makes you look younger I guess
Building a village on a site that is only fertile with magic stone and barren otherwise seems like a bad idea.
Nittany_Discord: Also im not exactly a small so I dont think ill be abducted
If that's true, damn you, Shiva. We didn't want this movie.
TWOLOT: CriticKitten said DARKNESS so I said that. It's a thing I do
dat kid
All right, gotta go eat. Later, everypony.
Nyst, they had dibs.
At the very least I'd protect the stones better.
Why should he?
oh lol
buck yo couch
So. Idea. Lets leave the crazy village, and NEVER come back.
sagas: how tall are you?
Movie over
He sound like Marvin the Martian

Lol
That rock dun goofed
Can I mention the abomination of The Crystal Skull?
I`m only 5`4 1/2
Oh my
sure. i didn't watch it
THERE IS NO 4TH INDY MOVIE
Not the children !
Shizuka let me go back to my house and i'll join i just found sheeps and pigs :p
0,14I liked Crystal Skull :3
LadyMarion: yes there is
conversely it takes a rock to raze a village
...Saxy, eat a dick.
Because everyone knows small children are perfect for intense manual labor.
LadyMarion: it's called Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
SaxyPretender: Aliens.....
LadyMarion: then what is The Crystal Skill i hear about?
I BLAME SLENDER MAN
0,14XD
lol
IT. DOES. NOT. EXIST.
I need minecraft so bad...
Saxy is from another dimension.
Nyst: they fit in the tiny holes and crevices
Jesus =/=Aliens
Nyst: But children are easier to capture than adults
LadyMarion: Wrong
Give him some water you ASS
I BLAME SLENDER MAN
otakon lalalal can't hear you what 4th movie lalalala
Nyst: They will grow into it and be strong adult workers
false, jesus is indeed an alien
I didnt think i d like it, but i Love Terraria, so i want to try it
children don't have to eat as much
Slendy can't live in India
I BLAME SLENDER MAN!!!!!!
There aren't any trees
Nyst: Hopefully....
True
Its a needless 4th movie. It was like a watered down parody of Indy 1 and 3.
CONSPRACY
:o
SLENDER MAN CAN BE ANYWHERE
Not a drawing of a key?
dat face
Lets be realistic here. If we are to blame anyone for the 4th indy movie it is only ourselves. They knew we would be suckered in by the name ALONE.
sagas: They'll most likely grow with back problems form all that work
so whatever happened to that lao che character?
Can we at least agree that Kingdom of the Crystal Skull didnt need to happen....
I LIKED Indy Four
when thought of Adventure_Striker
inb4 hate
shooting star
Well, I did see Harry Potter and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in theatres.
i wish the last airbender movie never happened
Shannara?
Barbetos: I know. I myself was lured in with the news that Ford would be back as well. Sadface.
Holy shit, they found the Elfstones?
Alister: Oh I know. Thats why you teach them proper lifting
sagas But it did happen.. and it will be around forver.. just like the prequels...
elephant
Life is RUINED!
Indy 4 Was kinda dumb when the mass of monkeys came around
dat Elephant
Elephant is best pony
GOD DAMNIT WILLY
wtf why is she so useless?
I knew The Last Airbender would be a massive failure so I'm not offended by it.
Close enough
do ho ho
what is she here for?
Order of best Indy movies: 3 - 1 - 2 with special mention for Fate of Atlantis.
/me self-/)s himself for making a reference no one likely understood. ;_;
The worse part is Indy barely killed anyone in crystal skull
TWOLOT, because she's "realistic"
Willie.
STFU
I wasnt bothered by the prequals, but I was by Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Is that weird?
XylemTube: Oh yes, CG monkeys were completely unnecessary
well she's dumb.
i thought they were poverish but they have 3 elephants
SHUT UP WILLIE!!
ephelants
I like to dream that Fate of Atlantis was the fourth Indy movie.
Why even take WIllie?
:D
And it's about now that you realize she's going to be in the entire rest of the film.
And you start to sob.
Worlds?
words
I had hope that the Prequels would get better over time
Wtf?
sniff
Nyst we should stream that!
Smell all thet hings
Cant they eat the elephants?
She is so dumb
...Why did Indy only have a huge tub of MAyonaise in his fridge anyway?
she's... perfuming her ephelant?
Why starve when you can eat elephant?
TemplemanFan: sure, there's a talkie version now.

She is not afraid of snakes
TWOLOT PLZ

JESmith71: well then his dog must of been a dumb bitch
Daygon: she didn't realise it was a snake.
acualy is dolan
Daring Do is not afraid of snakes.
She mistook the snake for the elephant's trunk.
she still threw it
Yep
she thought it was ephelant
Blind rage
so she didn't freak out
Bc she was pissed
How long has Daring been staring at Nitty's OC?
And it seems Speilberg actually liked her character...
Back, with Milk, Cookies, and Gummi Worms
Indy's not being very archeological in this movie is he?
dick joke dick joke dick joke dick joke.......penis
JESmith71: all damn night
f
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Lolwut
JESmith71 sionce yesterday

Isn't there a rumor that Spielberg slept with her?
Shooeie since yesterday's movie
Chestbuster!
is that how she got in the movie?
Every time you make a penis joke here a pony dies.
Nyst: no idea
Oh damn
That was Shooeie who asked not me
Necklace made from fingers.
Thanks to this film India lost half it's tourists
CHAT DERP
even the elephants are spooked
I had to change my nickname
Long Speilberg quote about Willie:
okie dokie doc
"Willie has led this pampered life and feels that's what's due her — to be cared for and looked after. She meets Indiana Jones, a person unlike anyone she has ever been involved with, and ends up going off with him. In the course of all their adventures, all of her earlier life is stripped away from her, and Willie must fall back on her own resources. She discovers that she is a very strong woman, a gutsy lady. Willie is a much different character
the ephelants got jacked
Let Willie go first
If that was his idea then he's failing so far.
Maybe she will die
so many cute bats <3
let willie fall into quicksand facefirst
please
In the Lego game you just skipped to the dinner scene
Shooeie, dont raise our hopes
JESmith71, thanks for that quote.
Guys, we gotta stop hating on Willie. She gets better.
I like Indy best when he's being a professor; solving clues, finding treasure, ancient temples and the like.
Does Short Round get better?
/me Oh, you look like credible people
The name's Round. Short Round.
LOL
if you say so kandarihu
SHE DOES?!?!
for now, i hate her.
In Diana Jones
she'll have to earn my like
Time for a dance number
O_o
Daring Do is Indy's mom after all
wat?
indie is half horse?
TemplemanFan: In what world is an equine parent to an human exactly ?
BRITISH!
TWOLOT, I did'nt mean to put it like that. I just meant as a suggestion, and... bah. I overstepped my boundaries.
TWO BRITISH PEOPLE!?
Captain Rhubarb?
Bulmbut?
Wuuut
New fan fic idea

Not to mention that Daring Do is ALSO fictional.

JESmith71.......Willie.....gutsy?......STRONG? :D
Just like Indie
So I guess anything goes
WOMEN!
THE HORROR
she's a strong independent white woman
So... Daring Do is Indies mom. Daring Do had sex with Sean Connery then?
Mr. Lawl?
That woman has only one thing on her mind.
Well it was Speilberg who said it not me

TallSquare: eeyup they are near a mountain

SUDDENLY BEAR!
they run into eachother in the hallway
SUDDENLY BEAR!
FROM OVER THERE!
Angry sex is better
Nyst: So she would shut up
xD
^
/me Five minutes later...
hey can we cut down on the whimsy a bit?
she really wants to smex it up with him
Nyst: Because bad scripting. Willie's just a hollow, shitty love interest for this film.
Eulshy: Since when is there other kinds of sex ?
WHIMSY DOWN!
*yoink*
JUST SLEEP
when was the last they...
Alister pity sex
you know...
Eulshy: That is the worst kind
Short Round is a better sidekick than Willie :|
click click whistle
THey both play hard to get, and the both loses
fail
Alister Make up sex
Nyst: And it boils down to the script writers not knowing how to properly write a female character that can do things other than throw themselves at "strong men".
John Williams is trying his hardest
fail
Eulshy: That one is good
Vodox: interesting to see that the signs where there back then, but at least then he still had a team of talented people around him to make the movie good.
GIGGTY
Everyone's a better sidekick than Willie
GET ON WITH IT
AND ASSASSIN!
IT'S A TRAP
SUDDENLY ASSASIN
OMG
and NO ONE hears this
DOES HE DIE?
Its like that one scene from Speed Racer
CLONK
CriticKitten: I know! I didn't really care in the past but it's irking me more and more as I get older.
I prefer Willie Nelson over Willie Scott :3
lol
xD
HA
LOL
ooh pajama, how smexy
Short Round Y U R NOT AWAKE?
WOOOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN
O MAI

"You spin me right round, baby right round..."
Cock-block
Excuuuuuuuse me, Princess!
Lara Croft she is not.
why doesn't he just explain?
Assassin search
Nyst: 'tis part of the reason I hate Willie so much. She's a prime example of shitty writing. I prefer characters that have some complexity, not boring "I broke a nail" stereotypes that can only be obnoxious and spread their legs for the male lead. >_>
TWOLOT: because she wouldn't get it.
Snake's cover is blown
But you are Nobody
Luv this part
Indy does not give a fuck
Secret passage
These are bigger

Guess you could call this a....booby trap.
David Copafeel
xD
that was a good joke
BOOBY-DOOR?
He prefers the statue
How many takes did it take for them to not laugh? xD
CriticKitten: A character doesn't even have to have complexity. They can be shallow and superficial, yet still be interesting if written well.
LOL TO BOOBY DOOR
I guess you can say it was a Booby-trap
Booby door is best door
and to think, he could be getting laid right now
inb4 he burns the paper
There are actually people that get off on statues
he really needs to get his priorities straight
11,01Back.
Archeology > Women
QUICK, TO THE BOOBY CAVE!
Indy would rather make out with that statue, than with Willie
11,01I didn't miss Kalima yet.
XylemTube: Thanks for telling us that. Now I can sleep easily at night
I don't blame him
i can see that
Dont bring the women
XylemTube: or naked store mannequins.
Say what you will about Willie, but if her claim to fame is screaming all the time... ;)
No spoiling, i haven;t seen this....
There might be a Boob-mobile
Because she is literally SO GODDAMN annoying, that the young little Chinese boy who can barely speak English is actually more useful!
Hah, classic.
GODDAMNIT SHORTY
SPOILER ALERT INDIE WINS
ddang it shortround
Hey. This is a pretty cool haunted house.

BOOB
lol
Oh MY
Batman Spoiler: the audience dies
BOOBS
Aw yeah
Nyst: True, sometimes. But Willie never gets there. She's always obnoxious, ALL THE TIME. She's as shallow as they come, living proof that there is a definite need for people to keep pointing out the double standard between men and women. >_>
Eww boobs
oh myyyy

/me 11,01serves chilled monkey brains to the chat

You guys are being racist against crickets :I
Really? That's no cookies?
I LOST MY LAST HOUSE TO ROACHES
bugs. why is it always bugs?
CriticKitten: Yeah and her constant high pitched screaming isn't helping. We (the audience) cannot relate to the fears she feels and as such don't care about her.
*cockroaches
So many insects
11,01It is a fortune cookie.
I fucking HATE roaches
11,01The fortune is bug guts.
HA A BOOBY TRAP
Bugs why did it have to be bugs
Good job, Short Round, you killed them both.
Booby-trap lol
Nittany are they undead monkey brains from the one in Pirates? Those are the best kind
Nittany_Discord, thanks, but I already just got my dinner.
Boobt
Kid. Why you no stick close to indy?
Nyst: Aye, and that's mostly because most girls aren't like that. >.>;

JESmith except Rarity would be a good character.
GET THE HAT
TF2 MUCH?
Suddenly, I now understand how this represents Speilburgs and Luca's recent divorces at the time of writing this film :P
/me agrees with Obsidian
Like I said earlier. The Temple of Tom.
11,01Kalima.
The children are whiny, the woman is almost useless...
i like this movie
I know. |||Just in the freaking over bugs and dirt thing
JESmith: Rarity is so much better written that it's insulting to call her Willie in this situation.
i cant stand willie
Now the most fucked up scene int the entire movie.
and short round is pretty annoying too
It's a boogie ceremony?
but i like this movie
I'M SURE THE HINDU RELIGION IS TOTALLY BEHIND THIS!
Kali!
Anyone else here a crackling?
11,01Kali ma!
JESmith, tell me you wouldn't be dead terrified in a room filled with bugs
DAT DRUM
I bet this is a paranoid hallucination.
Kali totally looks like that.
but shortround is awesome!
KALI-FORNIA GURLS
TWOLOT But at least he does something
Dr_Indiana92Jones, according to my mom, the only Hindus were the innocent villagers.
I hear some crakling
11,01They saw it.
"Aaaahhhh"
here we go
"AAaaaaaaaaahh "
So much betrayin of shiva going on around here.
IT BEGINS
11,01Who is that guy?
If I wanted Short Round, I'd just go watch The Goonies
Oh look, it's the bronystate audience :D
REPUBLICANS

Kandarihu Oh, OK.....point taken
Hindu Scafrice thread simulator
Mola Ram!
And there's Wrek :O

11,01Here comes a hater.
And the sacrifice victim is me :D
Oh damn, this
Nittany_Discord which guy are you :3?
y'all people have the weirdest fetishes.

11,01Kali ma.

The chorus is grat
Bjornfot has the weirdest fetishes of all
TWOLOT You have no idea
tickle his nipples!
TICKLE THEM!
O_o
he takes out his heart right?
Kalimaaaa
=_(\
11,01This guy needs to put more heart into this.
This film is what inspired the PG-13 Rating BTW
COVER YOUR HEART
Because it's with Lego people
And that's how Davy Jones lost his heart.
So THIS was the scene that Magicka had a shoutout to?
... Oh wait, you can't :S
If he did the same thing, but placed his hand on his head, would he got a brain instead?
yes...
That's so hawt with your hand round my heart GURL....
tickle them!
Heart problem?

He ded
This is totally realistic. :D

Suddenly the soundtrack got weird
Dat Guy on the maarkas
Buytoast, over the music I can hardly hear myself think
"Aaahhhh AHAhhh AAAHH'
11,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: Me too.

And then KND did a parody of this with Chocolate bunnies
He needs gelato
/me drums head

11,01And then they pull him back up.
And it was just as terrifying
CHANT CHANT CHANT

11,01Vordox: Wut?
Beezus and Ramona! How horrifying!!
so.... hi
Damnit Saxy
So according to this movie, India is apparently adjacent to fucking MORDOR.
Nittany_Discord: She, Willie, reacted when he was lowered into the pit, behind her sight....
Now that song is stuck in my head.
Basically an Anti Brony convention right here!
Night' everpony
:o
Nittany_Discord: Also, how do they know it's something BAD down there?
11,01Dunno.
typical saturday night
nighty Firstmate_Maid_Angel
at vordox's house
Wait until Donovan, Dr_Indiana92Jones. You know what I mean :3
11,01Guess he could hear the poor guy.
What in Equestria is that?
shirtless men
TWOLOT: Pfft, this is Tuesday
on their hands and knees
bonjour.
...Noooose
CriticKitten: someone had to be bad, India was chosen, i dont think any racism was intended
11,01Vordox: Isn't a human sacrifice usually bad?
These are the promised 42 virgins
Nittany_Discord: Yeah but just screams?
Nittany_Discord not in mah town :P
Eulshy: It's Hinduism , not Islam -_-
aww, it maskes a smiley face
i like that kid
sean connery stones
11,01"I tore this poor boy's heart out, and all I got was this stupid rock."
twilight_sprinkle: Clearly not, what with the Chinese stereotype child, the white female stereotype, and the Indian stereotypes.
I thought it was Sikhism?
Alister Meh, religion
DIAMONDS
"DIAMOONDS"
DIAMONDS
Diamish
diamonds!
DIAMONDS!
Alister, Eulshy, it's not hinduism either.
Altough , it really is more satanism at this point
BIG BEAUTIFUL BEDAZZLING DIAMOND
Vordox I think he means a typical Saturday for these guys in the movie
omg shut up willie
Rich stuff
"Well, that was great guys, let's go out"
Nittany_Discord: Do you have Lotr?
SDNOMAID
This is NOT SATANISM goodness sake
Oh NOW she's interested
Why?
Why does short round remind me of Data?
Mwaaah
It's Thugeeism actually
11,01"Where's Dave? He said he was going on vacation to Kaleema or something."
CriticKitten: big deal.
FORCED KISS
"This death thing so good girl"
Why do you need the stones? You have no reason to do this.
Not today!
stupid
don't kisss
SEXUAL HARASS
NOOOOOOOO
you can do better
:D
11,01Adventure_Striker: I don't have any LoTR game.
twilight_sprinkle: Racist stereotypes are always a big deal.
Nittany_Discord: Shame, second one on Console was awesome
I meant the movies
CriticKitten: because it means he can be away from Shortround and Willie for a few minutes.
don't be racialist
CriticKitten: have a little fun, would you. there are always villains, and they happen to have a nationality
Shizuka i have no idea how to speak lol
racist stereotypes make me feel good about myself; like I accomplished something.
Whips work that way right?
spiderman... spiderman...
Nittany_Discord: I`m talkng about the movie
Does whatever
11,01I wonder what happens when they tear someone's heart out but don't throw them in a pit.
He fucking wants
twilight_sprinkle: They're a sign of bad writing. You can make a villain without being culturally insensitive.
11,01Adventure_Striker: No.
"WATCH OUT FOR THEIR CHOIR INDIE!"
YOINK
What is this movie called?
OMG DOES HE DIE?
Yes, be all SLOW about it."
:'(
Raiders.
11,01That guy advanced surgery.
Did Indy just poke his eye out?
IT BELONGS IN A MUESEUM
And then he got greedy and didn't just run with the stone he had.
11,015-minute organ transplants.
I guess if John Williams cares, I should too
RUN DARING DO RUN!!!
twilight_sprinkle: it's not about the bad guys. More about the wholly inacurrate representation of a real religion, the horrible stereotype for shortround, and the other bits that have always been uncomfortably jingoistic in the Jones movies.
eeyaaahh.
CriticKitten: this is just one part of India
ruh ro........
get out of there
RUN
Indiiieee..
GET OUT
WAZZUP AWESOME BRONIEZ
RUN INDY

PAWNCH!!
lali-ho shuddup
/me 11,01hugs RAWRity
RAWRity: theres magic in this movie, as in the previos one, as in the next one. these movies arent about realism
RRRUUUUUNNNNNNN!!
OH SHIT MY HEART
Who got jumped?
stranger danger
lol
holy crap
Oh look, it's the bronystate administrators
twilight_sprinkle: Find me the location in India that looks like Mordor and is full of cannibalist heathens who worship the Hindu religion in this manner?
/me JUST SHITS A MASSIVE PILE
Deadlypon3: ahahaha :D
The other two movies never blatantly make it magic though. This is the only one that does.
/me Heigh ho, Heigh ho.....It’s home from work we— (whipping sound)
Deadlypon3: Rofl :D
twilight_sprinkle: Best of luck with that.
11,01Who tore out KalimanFan's heart out?
FATCHA
Meanwhile in China
twilight_sprinkle: that's not an excuse for taking a religion that exists IN REAL LIFE and getting damn near everything about it completely wrong.
OHHHHHH SHIT
FATCHA
TIME TOPUNCH PEOPLE
Wiat... He has friends!?
"CALOGNE"
Jello
...
THE F!
OLO

JELL-O!

Katars?
Don't take it seriously, mate.
SUDDENLY CAPTURED
USE YOUR WHIP INDIE!!
OHHHH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
CriticKitten: suit yourself, if you enjoy hating on movies for their whole duration, do it. but i swear, im running a statistic on your negative comments next time we watch a movie you dont like :P
idk how they can get out of this
Kali is a real goddess no?
Whip them WHIP THEM HARD
Yeah sure, Why not?
U rive ronger!
In the Lego game the Chart race came before the child slavery
RAWRity!!
shut up shor round...
*cart
RAWRity: its fantasy, rules are bent
D:
Nittany: No, it's a heavily overdramatized and completely false representation of a religion that actually exists, to the point where its flaws are downright offensive.
11,01He wants to die?
OMG
MY GOD......:'(
11,01He's next week's sacrifice.
Nittany_Discord: if you want a made up religion, don't use the name of a real deity.
RAWRity, only black people.
ohh man thats scary
Wierd
11,01RAWRity: I see.
"REALLEH!?"
i drank my own blood
"I DIDN"T KNOW THAT"
/me shrugs.
twilight_sprinkle: I like watching movies and riffing on them. But this one *is* a bad movie.
CHACKRA
11,01Who is the priest guy?
Nittany_Discord: Hammy McOveractor
twilight_sprinkle: So is World's End, though I enjoy World's End more than this film. :p
CriticKitten: you know, your hate would be a lot less annoying if you didnt state your opinions as facts
Mola Ram, peeps.
So...we use kids cause...?
/me glomps Nittany_Discord
Pedo
Why kids? Why not use adults?
11,01Ooof.
:>
Slave adults are healthier, stronger, and last longer
everyone please remember that the internet is serious business.
Kids last longer
11,01Cool story, priest.
not to be taken lightly
11,01Now explain the sacrifices.
CriticKitten: and i dont even care about this movie, i was afk for half of it. but when i left you were hating on it every minute, i return youre doing the same. give it a rest
Deadlypon3: But they can organise themselves and revolt
still, explorers did misinterpret other culture's religion for the worst.
Deadlypon3: becuase Kids are far stronger and more accostomed to menial labor than adults, of course!
EXPLAIN THE SACRIFICIES, DAMMIT!!!!!!
Alister ...And kids can't :I
o_o
Nittany_Discord: trolling
So in short, all the odd-numbered Indiana Jones movies are good. All the even-numbered Indiana Jones movies are terrible, right?
Deadlypon3: It's easir to scare kids
They gunna kuss?
twilight_sprinkle: And your disagreement might deserve more of my attention if it weren't always based on forgiving every single flaw in a clearly bad movie, and only getting angry at films which are so-bad-they're-hilarious. :P
easier*
Kandarihu ...There aren't enough for that
This is easily the darkest of the movies.
OH NO
don;t drink you say?
LOL
...REAlly, thanks kid
xD
Deadlypon3, well, that seems to be the pattern.
No, Mr. Jones, I expect you to DIE!
NOOOO

Sagas Your punishment must be more severe :I
short round is a genius
.... how does he know he uses a whip?
Hey is that the marahajah?
CriticKitten: but youre not making jokes, youre just hating on it. and again, youre stating your opinions as facts, saying that what you think is *clearly* true
I see teh Maha Raja is going along with them
twilight_sprinkle: I suspect you'd be bitching if my B Movie ever won. Even though it is *hilariously* bad. :p
Tyler_the_creator: he becomes EEEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVVILLLLLLLL
BURN HIM WITH FIRE
why is Voodoo in south asia?
I C
THIS IS SPARTA!
Well, I AM GOING TO HAVE NIGHTMARES
CriticKitten: what's your B movie
Maybe if there were a fifth Indiana Jones movie, it would be as good as the first and the 3rd one?
CriticKitten: i can enjoy hilariously bad movies, i love the room. im just tired of youre hate
sagas a case of did not do the research
I always thought those guys were some radical sect, not an actual hindu believers
RAWRity: Mega Piranha.

Kandarihu: they're planning a Fifth
Oh wait...
Thanks...
Wow...
MARO MARO FUERCO
this is pretty dark
RAWRity: U srs? ._.
OMG
11,01I wonder if they have issues with eruptions.
RAWRity, I hope they're going back to their roots, then.
CriticKitten: meh, not as hilarioiusly awful as Sharktopus
Nittany_discord Good point...
D: :(
Dken2021: "Its spooky and occult so lets throw it in there" -Producer
going back to their "roots"
Yeah, I can totally see how this is supposed to be campy and light-hearted and fun!
He lost his hat

DADY JONES NOOOO
He drank the coolaid :(
he drank zombie blood

Where's the "Expression of sheer terror" emote?
It's modern, too.
11,01And we will steal everyone's hearts with our fine religion...and sacrifices.
What with the cultist imagery and savage beatings and child labor camps and....wait. o.o
THIS IS FUCKING TORTURE
If they wanted to make a dark, gritty Indiana Jones movie...why the hell include Shortround?
Man, that blood must've tasted like shit.
aw man, hes blind again
He took way to much acid....
Is indie going to replace his hand with a chainsaw?
Lol!!!
OMG

Remember when this movie was all light-hearted and campy and fun at the beginning? I actually kinda miss that.
/me has the urge to see Black Dynamite vs Indiana Jones
they're all hypnotized
lol if that works
by that blood
Daygon: this is too obviously demonic to complain about it :P
He is Chinese
CriticKitten: I have a friend who actually chugs Faygo

He is smarter

D'aaaaaaaaawwwwwww

Running away would be a much better idea
NO NOW IS THE TIME TO LEAVE THE WOMAN BEHIND

Gotta say, one positive about this film? Harrison Ford's bare chest. The man looked damn good, gotta admit.
So we see Short Round in the other 2 movies, right, Sumica? Nittany_KaliMa ?

Voodoo doesn't work on someone who doesn't know that a doll based on him is being stabbed.
OHHH SHITT

DJPON3, you mean Daring Do?

hi everypony
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OR the kid is possessed :S
I need a random vector of one of the mane6 for trying something out for a new picture :)
No offense, but people who defend movies by saying "Can't you just watch a movie with your brain turned off and enjoy yourself?" are full of shit.

HELP SAVE ME SMALL ASIAN CHILD!
i'm back.............JUST IN TIME FOR EPIC ACTION SCENE!!!!!!!!!!
Short Round beat down
Barbetos, the old guy near the beginning had to read from the script; he didn't speak a lick of English.
dam the kid is overpowerd
15 Grown Men < Kid
Oh wait
quadra kill
I FORGOT SOMETHING
Hey Willie, wanna take an example from Short Round and, um, be useful?
shortround is mini indiana jones
WTF
15 Grown men < Asian Kid
kid is op nerf pls
There we go
grey steamy action sequences. my favorite
so while shortround is FIGHTING OFF GROWN MEN, willie's running away.
/me 11,01dusts Vordox with a cloud
Vordox, if it matters, then there must be a right mineshaft too that doesn't lead out.
OH SHIT
GUNS
Vordox: hes asian, hence unbeatable
hey shawty, what it is?
RAWRity: And that is why Willie is a horrible character
brb need a drink
/me Oh, save me, tiny little Asian boy! I hope Indy never knows he can do better than me.
Better he's Chinese
What am I gonna do, to get my Shortie back~
Shortround's in the movie because The Goonies was popular at the time.
tall square needs to man up
LIKE A BOSS
Short Round is underrated.
11,01*Splash*
Guns...?
Now?
WalkerPony89: one of many reasons, actually.
360 NOSCOPE HEADSHOT NOW!!!
aimbot
Indie, use the B button to speed up!
Jarjar??
ARE YOU FRIGGING KIDDING ME?! THEY FINALLY TOOK OUT THE GUNS AFTER 20 MINUTES?!
So Uhm...
Short Round isn't THAT bad now that I've seen him.
And here's the most iconic scene in the movie.
Dhalsam is not pleased with this
Red tuneel is bad
Blue = good, Red = bad
Wait, So the point of that scene was...Moot.
Blue tuneel good
take the LEFT tunnel
Minecart... Why did it have to be minecarts :S
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
ITS LIKE A ROLLAR COASTER
Short Round at least improved to being useful, though he started as a really bad Chinese stereotype. >_> Willie has yet to do anything.
listen to the androgenous voodooer
This reminds me of Medal of Honor Frontline.... dat one Mine level...
08,01hullo, lovelies
So, was that kid left behind?
No, you idiot, MY left :|
Shrotrounds ok, leagues better than Willie, but where the hell does he coem from?
Oh man, this is just ike those minecart game in Donkey Kong 64!
HELTER SKELTER
I've got a bad feeling about this.
::ew::
:ew:
This was the worst level in Donkey Kong Country.
This came first, RawketLawnchair :3
Pewpew
they got pistols
PinkiePieYoshi64: I remember that level! I actually played through Frontline a few days ago! :D
I know, I know.
they suck at shooting
nocturne: I loved them <3
Willie so useless
Donkey Kong 64, i beat it
You know, I didn't have that much trouble with Minecart Madness :S
I was annoyed at the exessive mine cart levels in DKCR
Minecart maddness was fun
why did he give the breaks to the kid?
WalkerPony89: I still play it a lot- that game is super fun :D
11,01What about Donkey Kong 65?
HATED this level in LEgo Indy
MLP CART race
Got all 201 Golden bananas
omg
PAYLOAD RACE
PinkiePieYoshi64: IKR? It's just way to short. I wish they made shooters like that nowadays
Troll
She's the damsel in distress. If she died in the firepit, it would've been a bad ending, even though a lot of people here would've rejoiced at it.
aaaahhhhh
EAT SHIT AND DIE
11,01I'll get your golden bananas...if you know what I mean. =p
o_O
omg
Honey Minecart don't give a fuck
Right in the childhoof
Nittany_KaliMa: Oh my
Hey guys, remember that scene in Lord of the Rings, where Frodo and Sam were trying to outrun the Balrog in the Mines of Moria in an extended minecart chase sequences?
Vordox: Or is he?
WalkerPony89: Unfortunately they stick too much 'epicness' of graphics in shooters these days, that it kills the storyline completely :/
Tyler_the_Creator, that was a quote from Clayton Carmine
HE just Went RIGHT Tunnel!?
AND THEY WENT LEFT?
Was that just me who remembers that scene? D:
!WTF
omg
trolled
Best shortcut ever
CriticKitten: and how legolas kept screaming like a little girl the whole time?
lol
Don't SHOOT the gun, just HIT THEM with it
Lava!
I remember this as a kid
GIMMIE THE ASIAN
Indiana Jones and the Journey To the Center of the Earth
Is taht Lava below them?
I was on this ride
Suddenly, Short Round is a little Stretch Armstrong........
RAWRity: EXACTLY! Wasn't that the most memorable part of LotR ever?
it was awesome
Dem stretchy human body
Look at him STRETCH
PinkiePieYoshi64: Unfortunately true. I especially want a shooter that's designied like that, IE no cover system and no regenerative health
He's like a fable 3 hand :D
holy shit
there is the lefft
...Willie...might wanna stab him
no cover?
CriticKitten: right next to that scene where Aragorn was tossed off of his elephant into some mud when he asked to take a shower.
Remember the final battle in Speed?
"Hands the Enemy's hand to Willie, does nothing."
what's the point of that?
05,15Oh...it's THIS one
ohhh no
so you just run out and shoot people?
Well, one useful thing
SHE
...
DID
Hai Fluffs
SOMETHING
RAWRity: True, that was a good scene too.
no strategy?
And Daring Do did nothing
Hai fluttercry
chekhov's dropped lantern?
hai fluttercry
NO
Ohi fluttercry
GRAB THE HEAD
AT LEAST SHE DID SOME THING
hiya fluttercry
dat jump
Willie finally makes herself useful for ONCE
How the hell?
....wait
Daygon, DARING DO DID MORE THAN YOU EVER WILL
i'm missing all the fun
kirzstryfe: dude good to see you
Hai fluttercry
Willie knows when to scream and when to punch
WalkerPony89: Good Celestia! I hate the regenerative health in today's games! Whatever happened to the good ol time when you had to storm a room with like 20 enemies knowing you had 5% health left?
my stream is buffering!
faaaaaaiiiiil
this movie needs more adveenturing and less monotonous loud action
TWOLOT: ICWUDT
Fluttershy is here! Yay!
13i don't understand why minecraft is playing so horribly badly now...
o_O
So they live in MORDOR and have a giant bucket prepared just in case someone tries to escape through the mine shafts, and....
KalimaFan, what did i do6_9
Well he's awfully happy for his entire operation going up in smoke
Break broke
/me bluescreens
its like that part from lord of the fies, the two towers
We missed the part where Daring Do rode out of a cave on a mine cart
Any horror movies played?
NOTHING! BUT DARING DO IS MORE OF A MAN YOU WILL EVER BE

13trixie should be in an ice biome a very very long way from home
You want water? HERE YOU GO!
Tyler_the_creator: I love horror movies, I think we should all watch them
YOU ASKED FOR IT!
ALWAYS GO RIGHT
WATER WATER ..... TOO MUCH WATER
YOU GOT IT!
PinkiePieYoshi64: I don'mt mind regenerative health, but EVERY SINGLE SHOOTER doesn't need to have it. I hope game devs abandon the idea that every game they make has to be "realistic", because it's getting really overdone
11,01There's your water!
i HATE horror movies
LOL
Yeah, go right, the water....won't follow you that way?
lol
Would be fun to watch the shining :D
Tyler_the_Creator, ever watch THE STUFF?

13you're very very far southeast actually
05,15I see I already missed "We're not sinking WE'RE CRASHING!"
WalkerPony89, regenerative health IS a diversion from realism.

Nevermind
Oh God
dat bridge
SHOR ROUND YOU IDIOT
Hey, I think I remember this scene. This is where the Shadow Bolts try to recruit Short Round, right?
HOLY SHIT|
I do have some strong wood
Short Round is no expert in wood
11,01Dumbass Shortie.
why were you jumping?
CROCOGATORS :O

Like there were alligators in India :|
Dem sacred crocodiles

why did it have to be ninjas?
Not today, Indy.
05,15Dat callback to the first
No gun this time
dat ninja
Ah, that callback to the first movie
NINJEWS!!
Kandarihu: It's still a part of almost every shooter out there, and since most shooters try to be "realistic", it isn't hard to put two and two together. I hope I'm wrong though
who needs a gun when you got a whip
"AAHAHHHH!!!"
KalimaFan: Har har
dat whip
wtf
XD
LETS WATCH CHRONICLE!!!!!
LOL
11,01Blame Willy for the lack of gun.

CriticKitten: no no, this is where the Manticore gets stopped by Willie's inherent tal- I can't even finish that sentence. Willie has no talents.
Fuuuuuuu
Indie has the best reactions
Okay, that was funny.
OHHHHHH

I find it unlikely that you'll locate those stones if they fall off a cliff like that. >_>
Indy ploy

W-Why are you making THEM walk the bridge?
05,15RAWRity ah yes...they did tend to scream a lot
Oh shoooT!! I mean... DAMN!
yetirulez I am Dken2021 ?
WalkerPony89, true realism in shooters would be that not only would lost health not regenerate, but it means an "injured" status where all your stats such as moving speed, aiming speed, max hp, and accuracy takes a hit, and you continue to lose health just because you were shot.
Since the cliff leads to a river that would carry them downstream and....you know what, never mind, logic and all.
We go for ride
those guys are slow, its pretty clear is gonna cut the side
lol
what
Oh my
god
I'm on Vicki's tenure now.

/me goes to check if crocodiles actually live in India's rivers, because I don't actually think they do. O.o
they only have them when it's convenient for the main characters
chat derp damn it
OH MY GOOOOOOOD
It's a suspension bridge. When's the last time we've seen a suspension bridge that DOESN'T get destroyed?
Quit sacrificing yourself to Kali! Quit sacrificing yourself to Kali!
COVER YOUR HEART!
ew ew ew
OMG WTF
Kandarihu: Well no there's no way that kind of health system would be used, except maybe a few rare instances. I'm imply infering that most devs think regenerative health systems are "realistic" because of their constant use and from devs claiming their whole game is "realistic". Even if I'm wrong, it's still a very overused system
DON'T TICKLE HIS NIPPLES!
Is he hitting a bundle of reeds? what's with that punching sound?
11,01Short, don't tell him how to kill Indy.
Stop punching yourself
MY NIPPLES ARE MINE THEY BELONG TO ME
YOU BETRAYED THE SHAREHOLDERS
o they play mlp hear
I've always wondered how those old rope bridges were made to begin with. It can't have been an easy process.
xD
waht is he doing
W-Why did you DO XD

Well that was pointless lol

GET OFF THE BRIDGE
GOOD THINKING SHORTIE
twilight_sparkle, he could had just kicked him
DA STONES ARE MINE
when do they play mlp O.o
...W-Wait, He didn't betray Shibeh
CriticKitten: and even now, Indy still has to do the rest of the job himself.
05,15YOU BETRAYED SHIVA
otakon: In a game where it actually makes sense, yeah. Halo 1 and Reach had great health systems; I really wish more devs would use a system like that
How dare he betrey the ice summon
W_What?
Daygon: he tried, he couldnt
Use the Forc.... I mean, use the stone, Jones.... the sacred stone!!!
inb4 Wilhelm
still
WalkerPony89, regenerative health is nothing but a function to add convenience to a gameplay mechanic. If the game dev puts it in their game and then claims to be making everything totally realistic, he's lying through his teeth.
Why's Shiva… nvmd
YOU BETRAYED THE LAWW
STILL
Uh

Nittany_Discord: Nah it's a cool gimmick though it's unrealistic
Nittany_Discord, the fridge scene is the best in that movie
Shia Laboeuf is fine
Shia Lebouf was an ASSHOLE
I know logically it's impossible, but they did take their chances into making into that conclusion
This movie was bad, but at least it was original.
Shia Laboeuf is FINE.
No no nonono no no NO
Nittany_Discord The fridge scene is so memorable I think becuase people like to compare it to the "jumping the shark" thing
Actual Canniba Shia Lebouf

Loser, actually, JESmith

Polydunami: Because parents these days are morons. Don't want them calling Treehouse saying they're "offended" and they're gonna sue

I thought Watto was a Greek stereotype
twilight_sprinkle: There was a massive backlash over Episode 1 after release because of the character's behavior. How did you miss that? >_>

nonononononononononoNO
NO!
oh man, i'm naming off reasons i don't like the movie! i better have people act obnoxiously to further reinforce my beliefs and make myself seem better
lol he's totally right
twilight_sprinkle: it hasn't been used in 30 years.
this guy is such a selfabsorbed douche
"is the router plugged into the modem", "is the computer plugged into the power socket", etc. :3
No, it's not, since Mythbusters proved that this works.
lol
So yeah.
lmao
CriticKitten: probably because im not sosensitive
Harrison Ford was still hawt.
Buytoast: um it's not always like this
0,14ohhh
Critickitten Not the point; It's less believable :P
What did Mythbusters prove?
Indian Doc Brown
CriticKitten: When? WHEN?
PONY ROCK ANTHEM!!
CriticKitten - i thought they proved that it didn't work
Deadlypon3: No it's not. O.o
at least not "riding" the raft
Buytoast what a great reviwer /sarcasm
ikr
pony_6049: that you can use a raft as a parachute
YFW this man came BEFORE Doc Brown. Well, was in a movie released earlier.
as a parachute, yes; as a glider, no
Children last longer
Simple step by step stuff? :P
OH THE IRONY!
LOL
otakon: Ah I see. Thanks
05,15Mythbusters said the Raft was BS
RAWRity: and youre assuming english is my native language and i know what terms are old or not?
you'd think so
for the poon
Bronystate raft?
otakon: I'm sorry
fluttercry: wait I thought they said you could
No they didn't!

but it comes up so often it's not even funny
you see? everyone hates her.
lol
THAT IS TRUE EVERYONE AGREES
lol
YAAAAAAAAAAY
otakon - riding the raft down they busted; but they tried using it as a parachute and it rougly worked
Deadlypon3: A lead-lined fridge being hurdled along at high speeds versus a raft being used as a parachute? Yeah, sorry, the former is definitely more implausible.
Rob Schneider movies?
And Speilberg thinks she's a gusty character...geez
MirrorImage: yeah that I meant
Critickitten not saying either is believable
RAWRity: who gives a shit
twilight_sprinkle: also, stop taking shit so seriously. It was a joke brah.
Yeah, i remember now. Raft was busted. Escape slide was plausible though
WHOAAAAAAAAA
LOL
6_9:P:[
This guy gets too angry
that's going a little far
"BAT CREDIT CARD:[
SHUT UP
I CAN SEE WHY
SOUNDS LIKE RARITY COMPLAINING

Dat Ren&Stimpy
REN AND STIMPY!

LOL
Ren & Stimpy, even lower
Tyler_the_creator: no

WalkerPony89 - same point though
"Why would i plug my computer into the wall, my power isnt working" :D
ever try to walk someone through setting up their tv, over the phone, when you can't see the menus they're navigating, don't know the syntax of them, and they've never touched a tv with a menu before?
DAT RE-WRITING
Yeah, that deserved it.
Tyler_the_creator: Rarity conplaining is funny and adorable
Agreed
Willie was fifth?
RAWRity: sorry, but your jokes are weird..
YAY

Tyler_the_creator rarity wasn';t that annoying

i loved that movie as a kid :)
Tyler_the_creator: YES!
I agree with tyler
Willie is not so ANNOYING its just that they FORCE her to be annoying!
Dr_Indiana92Jones: Rarity is best whiner
dunno why, but i did
Dr_Indiana92Jones yea, unlike willie
Peewee herman's big adventure
That....actually doesn't look like Shiva. O.o
great movie
i wonder would the pee wee movies be A or B?
I LOVED Peewees Big Adventure!
I've had to do it for old people I don't know, that were already frustrated from trying it >.<
magica scmagic BOOOO
So would Pee-Wee Herman's Big Adventure count as a B movie?
this guy sounds like a crybaby
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW I didn't know you CAN survive that!
LOL dem normal people
Polydunami - probably
EWWWWW
Spectrum_Indy: Is it low budget?
Polydunami: yes
Damn... I wouldnt be able to do that O_o
most "children's" movies would i would expect
it's a boy
though I do find it funny when someone can't get something to work, they bring it into the store, then I touch it and it starts working >.>
WalkerPony89: i have know idea
I'm guessing it would be a B movie, even if it was directed by Tim Burton.
OMG WHAT

Well...

Spectrum_Indy: If it is then I have no idea. Low budget = B movie, but it's made with a more A movie style, so I have no idea myself
LOLWUT*
back out slowly
OH MYYYYY
Take three steps back and RUN
Robanter

hmmm, Pee Wee's budget was $6,000,000 ,and it made $99,184, so yea, B
OHHHHHH SNAP

How would Indy fall for HER?! They're such polar opposites!
:o
WalkerPony89: only blonde in town
WalkerPony89: he's horny.
Yeah, I call bullshit on the 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes
yoink
RAWRity: its like this, NC: ok fans, i made a new review, now you must hate it :[
THIS GUY IS SUCH A CRYBABY
Peewee's Big Adventure was THE BEST EVER
RAWRity: Good point
superretroworld: um no not really
why is Spiderman choking Indiana Jones?
Dat stupid death
Peewees big adventure was just peewee looking or his bik
MirrorImage he owed him one
because that's how fans work
HOLY SHIT
11,01Push them boobs.

RAWRity: like The Grinch
THIS GUY IS SUCH A CRYBABY!!!:[
the chinese boy is cool

LOL, Booby door leads to booby trap
05,15NC is not meant to be taken 100 percent serious

Boobie Door leads to Boobbie Trap... sems legit.
what fluttercry
I've seen a few lcd tv's with impact fractures, those can be cool to see
he's so right though

Well, out-of-character Doug did get pretty worked up in Twilight Breaking Dawn review.
Dat Kali
yeah thats true thats its only his opinion
Collie?
I don't even know why he still calls them reviews
Yeah this is for comedic effect. It's like AVGN he's doing some of this as an act for comedy
ITS A DOG!!!
yay daring do
lol
We also need to watch Yahtzee's LEGO INDIANA JONES review
otakon its just so stupid
DON'T TOUCH MAH NIPPLES
Tovler: that was mostly because Twilight of all things was trying to talk about abortion and women's rights.
05,15Like Yahtzee, they both have points, but they exagerate for comedy. You aren't supposed to view it as a serious review
Daygon: that's half the point it's called COMEDY
StinkomanFan: We need to watch some ZP period
person bringing it back says it doesn't work, so I take it out of the box, plug it in, see a nice little spiderweb fracture like they dropped it on a table corner when they were setting it up
lol
so many colors
And maybe watch that 5 minute Lego Indy and the Raiders of the Lost Brick thing
As he said out of character (As Doug Walker) ''People shouldn't take the Critic seriously''
Nit-censor
"You gained a piece of heart!"
don't eat the heart daring do
When I was younger
Dat cover Daring Do

SaxyPretender: You have ONE chance to use a burst system to win...

0,14BBCT did it bad, CS made it better, but not perfect
NO PROBLEM
Stop screwing with the missiles

This defeys all physics
13aaaand back up
0,14Overdrives for each character have been revealed already
now, lasso it with a rpoe
INTO THE EYE OF THE STORM
inb4 ded
0,14some, like Blood Kain idea, I can understand
Nittany_Discord, I think you need to either turn game volume down or turn mic up
0,14but FKRZ as Overdrive?
INdeed, strenghten and new combos
Oh sweet. Big Fish made it to the top 250 on imdb
SaxyPretender: Well yeah, High chance no light block
0,14it makes me wanna headpalm
Tovler: What's number 1?
13shaders are still broken in nether...
SaxyPretender: That's why we have loketest :P
WalkerPony89: Still Shawshank
0,14because we've gone back to CT where it's either FKRZ or defense

SaxyPretender: These 8-12 loketest will be... hard to watch trhrough. We'll have to see
Bai yetirulez
:|
0,14as it stands, I can't say I'm a big fan
/me glomps Shizuka
0,14because everyone's going to save it for the last round in a last ditch attempt to save the match
Nittany_Discord is now a storm chaser
wonder how badly I'd get laughed out of the card shop if I went to trade in my old Magic cards to buy pony cards
riders on the storm
0,14or rather, save it for the last parts
0,14of a round in order to comeback
SaxyPretender: Depends.
Can we spawn objects here?
there's a killer on the road
SaxyPretender: clearly they need to just introduce a Redline option, where you hit a button and your car turns into abstract art for 20 seconds.
SaxyPretender: If it's a "Fast animation" overdrive. we can enable some GOD combos
SaxyPretender: Even during mid games, like Blood Kain
Oh sweet jesus
Nittany_Discord: I think the game is do loud now :(
*too
Yesssss
If ya give this man a ride Sweet memory will die Killer on the road, yeah
Excelent....
Good thing Nittany_Discord doesn't have a driver license, right?
13aaaand traveling out of the nether crashes minecraft
13yaaaay
0,14well, if it's doable mid combo then fine, i guess
SaxyPretender: Imagine Bang insta Furinkazan during combos for some high damage
Also, you sure you can only overdrive ONCE per game?
Shizu crashes everything
0,14but you already have that
this song <e
<3
lol
0,14Overdrive, iirc, has its own meter
0,14once that's filled, you have to hit an Offensive Burst in order to trigger it
Oh the red meter, aye
When can we add some fun to this tornado alley?
0,14the time it lasts is inversly proportional to the health you have
Ayup
TO SPACE
Awww
Wheeeeeeeee

AttacktheAndalite: no i didnt XD
00,10we already watched it

HatchetRyda: It was in Virginia but apparently it was strong enough for people here in Columbia to feel it, people near where /I/ live. I didn't feel anything, though. It was mostly felt in downtown
i mustve still had school at the time...
k thx Sumica
HatchetRyda: How could you have NOT known about it? It was on the news the week it happened.
00,10so acording to USGS, it was a 4,4 in yorba linda CA
HatchetRyda: Google that and come back and tel me what you learned.
AttacktheAndalite: yes honey *off to Google*

done die SB
*dont
Crimson_Phoenix: What are you talking about? Check the current ongoing Fixes.
Crimson_Phoenix: For being 2 peoplethey got 9 characters fully working
Tiny Toon Adventures was a good series for it's time, and it spawned some surprisingly fun liscensed games.
Now they are just adding content to the point of where they are happy =P
Most littl kids that rage playing TF2 will say stuff like "STOP KILLING ME!" and such. Stop killing you? BUCK NO! That's the whole point of TF2. KILL EACH OTHER! :D

Hi
Hey GreeHetBronyInDuitsl
Tyler_the_creator, he's using a physical SNES. He doesn't believe in roms
forreal? :O
thats badass.
Sumica: apparently, i'm honestly not so savvy on mods for skyrim but a mate of mine had a similar problem and those are what he said some of the mods were
Ponies47: can it run skyrim? cuz mine runs it ok only on absolute lowest res and details, and after 3 mins my laptop heats up so much it starts lagging
Why is it so surprising?
finally
F*ck you dizzy.
twilight_sprinkle: Funny thing about that... I have NEVER played Skyrim :$
naa
HES AWAKE
Dizzy!
Ponies47: k. if your pc sucks, make it sure it would run ok before buying it
AttacktheAndalite: ok honey, this is what i learned: A 5.8 magnitude earthquake centered northwest of Richmond, Va., shook much of Washington, D.C., and was felt as far north as Rhode Island and New York City and as far south as the Midlands of South Carolina.
my twitter feed is saying earthquake
00,10ok it's defenatly a mod conflect.

Haio Spell-of-Gaming (didn't see you there :p)
Pretty much everyone in my school is one too :D
Ohei Spell-of-Gaming!
I used to be productive until I got suckered in to the internet more. :3
Ahh the internet, how you take our livelyhood and grind it into a fine powder where it is made into a balloon and held in the hands of a 10 year old kid who rages at you.
Go Bruce!
גקג
00,02i forgot how to game
ded
:D
COUNTER :D
Next pony Phase4's animation should be becoming Batman and falling flat on his muzzle :D
00,02XD
00,02Vordox, ^ MadSurge
Oh btw Phase4, you can hurt people with the gel explosive, but you can't hurt yourself (Batman will still wince for a moment if you're too close)
00,02neat
Oh u Mark Hamill :D
Hey everypony

Hello
00,02maintinance workers need access to it
Hello Sneaks
00,02do they crawl through the vents too?

I believe so?
All the workers are Gordon Freeman
They live in the vents :/
one does not simply make a logical game about batman
GO BATMAN! FLY INTO ACTION WITH A LOUD SWINGY THING SO NOBODY CAN HEAR YOU!
Phase4: play zelda 2
this game was so much easier to deal with when i switched to using a controller
Go loudy batty
Lol
JRP2234: Let him play what he wants
I was going to suggest portal if he was up for suggestions :P
hell play what he wants
Ik ik
considering he doesnt have to stream at all, just be grateful hes playing at all
also, hai Wrek
I was just saying IF he WAS up for suggestions
05hi
Hello Wrek|Observiking
I like that he is streaming and the game he is playing is pretty cool
Phase4: Coulda kicked the door down into his face :/
Aww I liked your other title Wrek :P
00,02i'm not batman
???
Yeah Asylum was pretty cool, i did like the open world of Arkam City
*What is this sorcery*
Phase4: you could've placed explosive gel on the wall, that would've knocked out the thug. Maybe.
00,02meh
00,02was going for a silent takedown
But that failed miserably XD
11,02Night all :)
Nighty, SuperBrony64|Zzz
G' night thugs
/me glomps SuperBrony64|Zzz over a cliff

Again with the silent takedown strategy?
Or something new?
05night sb ^_^
There you go
That is a better strategy I think

lol
dat fail sneak
00,02i'm not good at this
I don't get it :P
Phase4: We can tell
try different stuff
dat Joker raspberry :D
I'm back
Phase4: when you glide kick an enemy, try to perform a ground takedown. You can also hang from the gargoyles and perform a silent takedown when a thug passes under it.
MUFFINS!
Awwwww
Mods, stop it with having like 7 windows open. It makes El Shitbox sad
...
ill have nightmares now
Shut up, Harley. You're not Tara.
my chat derped
nvm
are you sure your supposed to kill the people?
maybe its a rescue mission deal
Yeah, sure seems tedious for a killmission
any1 mods on i have a question
00,02how do you silent takedown from gargoyle?
00,02also wont let me ground takedown it seems
Hang down from it. Dunno the controls on PC, though.
A ground takedown appears to be left ctrl+RMB.
Phase4: The guy must pass exactly underneath it and the game will give you a prompt
Phase4, there's free DLC added to Magicka. Wanna check it out?
00,02Kandarihu, sure
It's only available on Challenge and Vs modes, though
