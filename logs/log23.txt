I just figured something out
if you say all the vowels
Oh?
you're starting to say Ayumi's name
AEIOUMI
thus, when dari always says "AEIOU" he must be summoning Ayumi
Oh... wow.
You're saying it wrong.
:P
You don't enunciate each vowel.
They all run into each other.
I've always read it as Ay-oo-mee.
Aye (as in a pirate's "yes") Oo-Mee here
Sort of like eye-you (for AEIOU).
teah

If it's a weeaboo name, which I assume it is, I think Dari's correct.

12these fillings
12feel really weird
i know right
i did need to get one toothe shaved
ew
4Boy, sure is quiet in here
9also
9Hipster_Brony
9what episode is first?
9I forgot
bi-kick clinic?
The one with the technicolour ponies with tattoos on their asses. :p
bi-kick
7it looks more like skin flesh
And arc is back
9it's also the color of RUURUUS
o.o
odd
hehe
8oops, was afk
8suited for success 1st
4He has
Yeah, I finished it yesterday.
A mod needs to use it though.
9wow that was fast
4I was in here last night when he got it done
/me 6pokes lightlugia.
o.o
6Why the name change, out of curiosity?
because i felt like it
You can't use it on mibbit, you need to get a proper client like mIRC. :P
i've had to get fillings before
6Eh, okay.
a couple of them
12lightlugia
12a tooth shaved?
never had braces
9well shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii-
12like it grew hair?
9...I have jmIRC on my phone
9does that count?
no
i remember i had to get a tooth drilled or something
I doubt a phone version works with scripts, it might.
It's not hard to install though.
9what do I have to do to run it,anyways?
Just open up the script editor in mIRC and paste in the script. :P
like grinding it
i seem to remember not having anaesthesia but i think because i was 7 or something any pain was scream-worthy
yeah ground or something
9not you, Rurik. I mean CharlesAJ
ouch
i also have crossbite but that's not really an issue
12a cleaning?
i remember that one
no?
12no they wouldn't drill for that
9IS ANY OF THE MODS WILLING TO USE A PROPER IRC CLIENT?
9cause I'm sticking to this IRC applet because it's handy for streaman
9that, and I'm lazy
@Battle-Brony - I haven't seen it. I simply can't find it anywhere. ANYWHERE. but oh well.
man
i know right
my bottom canine teeth are in front of my top teeth
6Hey, Nick. :>
i think it's my canines
9also, OREENJI-KUN
8we can get it worked out during the week in time for next week's
It'd take less than 5 minutes for someone to install mIRC...
o.o
9and it's ready
And have it running.
0You haven't been able to find it anywhere? Ouch
9I used to...
9.....
9....
lightlugia: it's 27.8C in my room
6Ovo
6What
hotter outside
6What's with Zoroark?*
9....
9prince-dari
9register
9REGISTER NOW.
ew..that is hot
9is to appoint a script mod
9does half-op work for scripts too, Dari?
7what about Hannah Illinois?
If half-op can kick, then yeah.
hehe
9yes, half-op can kick
/me ~NP: Pendulum - The Other Side
Ok, done.
i think it's supposed to get to 35.5C here
Oh, also I need a list of the nicks the mods use on here.
8arcesious, use filestube
8i use that for music all the time
4Silverscreen
8and lou_cyphre, i guess, is he even coming?
9he hasn't registered to IRC yet
4If he doesn't show up, he's stripped completely
about 29C
outside
yeah it still looks like pirating. I'm sort of a good-toe-shoes when it comes to the law
:P
8yes, pirating is wrong and we do not condone such activities here
8ALL GLORY TO THE RIAA
/me ~NP: Pendulum - Mutiny

Kill all the filthy landlubbers, send them down to the decks below.

pfff

corn
8Clint Eastwood: Great actor, great director, terrible person
....
it's really pretty nice out today
hillow everypony. :3
Yeah, westerns are about as far out of my usual range of genres as you can get. Unless they're parodies like the Frisco Kid.
8hello
csb
Though since I found out in the expansion you can get a unicorn that trails a rainbow and spawns butterflies I want that now. :<
i'm not too fammiliar with it...
That's the only reason I want it. XD
8also, my roommates and i named one of our fish clint eastwood

Ok.

12i can't believe
12that i have to go back to the dentist later
8eyup
12to get 6 more fillings
4Arc: pretty much
12i just had 5 done yesterday
ouch
oh wow
9only the person sees it
Ok, give me a sec.

Ok, all set up I think.
You have it set to warn once, then kick, yes?
*twice
Yeah, ywice.
twice*
8crystal pepsi
8lol
0It's not really a font... it's just a color

8uh oh, thats not good
Retrospect, probably should have tested this last night.

9ADIOS AMIGOS
Dat music.
Western that made Eastwood famous.
sombrero
4"Kick me"
*scrolls up* You asked something? I don't see anything but statements...
the western equivilent of "kick me"
13I enjoy the music selection.

ONLY LEGIT MUSIC?

9WHAT ARE YOU SELLANGGG
Best bell ringer in town

4Just shoot him Clint
Guns that shoot liquor
Hells Bells
lol

13Fistfull of Dollars

Hoofful of Bits
A gun that shot liquor would never leave my mouth
11A hooffull of Dollars.

Intense hat tipping
I think Mibbit's having problems tonight.

ow ow
oh look, token assholes
oooh shit

that means hello
Nice move, Clint.

quite
His horse is Scootaloo's aunt.

4Silverscreen, good point. My faith in Clint still remains
My kind! How racist!
You mean Shia LeBitch?
on the plus side, the coffen maker is making a KILLING
RIP roulette wheel
4LOL Home Alone
NOT THE ROULETTE WHEEL!
Won't someone please think of the roulette wheel!
ok, that's different
...stupid cafe I'm in just HAD to have music night tonight. >>;
and he just shoots thtem all.
widows have dicks
THE WOMEN AREN'T WOMEN!
widows=/=women
It's pretty much a remake of yojimbo.
Dari, how are you doing that?
$5 says someone stupidly casts Shia LeBitch to star in a western.
he must be making plenty of bits
Not shot for shot, tho, there's some substantial differences
9brb
Clint Eastwood: Sexyiest man alive or SEXIEST man alive?
Dari is the chatroom.
yahhhhh...kinda make me thinks of yojimbo
Dari has all power.
0black type
oh, here we go
haha hipster_brony
he's all old and wrinkly...
That would be beyond ghastly.
It's a REIMAGINING of yojimbo, not a real remake
Okay, now we're good.
Upstairs
Fair enough.
Dur
Yojimbo and Sanjuro were both fantastic.
I really have to be more careful.
not me
11Shia Lebouffe isn't that bad of an actor. Just like Nick Cage, he just needs the right roles to play in.
GTFO of my balcony
12LOL!!!!
12drf
they would both win darf
he hides his pron on that balcony
12http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/epic-fail-photos-diabetes-support-fail.jpg
lol
where did his horse go?
Bandits and smugglers...
I don't think I can stay long this time. I have graduation soon.
Maybe Applejack and Clint can work together?!
lmfao
And gamers
but they'd become friends
Yeah, and action movies are about as far away from the right roles as you can get for LeBitch.
and maybe the clopflic he wrote too >.>
well if ya hafta leave nick, at least have fun at graduation
Screw you and the clopfic you rode in on.
i need a picture of clint eastwood riding applejack. Nao
lol
Sure as heck never seen the kid it it.
Baxta!

8yeah, the room is after ponies
11Damn, I wouldn't have thought of that. But now that you mention it, can do.
It'll be my first time watching the room, actually.

13Fistfull of Dollars - Winter Wrap Up - Suited for Success - The Room
4Brony_T: no
just checking
probably spelling his name wrong
8pics are fine
yeah we come for the talk really
06saturday. Or well, today for me now :P
and this is an awesome movie
4Just don't spam pics
just curious
Thank ya Unintelligent =)
Why is The Room the laast?
13BECAUSE IT IS!
its the best! :P
I made a "Guile's theme" Room edition was the reason
Yeah, I'm basically in the same predicament. Well, other than being halfway into college.
Lineup was randomized, IIRC
Because everypony would leave after the Room and ponies. :p
FLUTE AGAIN
13Today for me too, but I tend not to consider it "tomorrow" until I've gone to sleep and woken up xD
I came for The Room- Stayed for the ponies
4Indeed, lineup was randomized
Northwest america
I know more than I should for not being a mod. XD
That clint is a spah
Clint is the most awesome gunslinger ever.
I only came for Eastwood. Skipping The Room prolly
Acting
everyone's looking for work and hardly anywhere is hiring
why is he not being hung like the sheriff said?
Lol
lol
Haha, exactly.
8turnibrony, you cant skip the room
11I just realized we aren't even referring to him by his character. He's just Clint.
its the ponie train!
8its ridiculous
4Yep, he's Clint
well he's the man with no name
he has no name
He has a character?
well, he doesn't really have a name
Everyone HAS to watch the ROOM
I concur
I can skip the room and watch something interesting.
I can't wait for The Room!
Is "The Room" a good film?
And nopony can stop me!
It's legally binding
no
Never even heard of it.
no it is not
4Outline: Yes
BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
8the room is the worst movie ever made
The Room is a hilarious film. You won't regret it
it's a fantastic film
its in no way, shape or form a good movie
Security's asleep. Investigate stagecoach!
it's one of the worst
11And that's why we're watching it.
The Room is genious
the room is hilariously bad
It's worse than Moanos?
It's like Plan 9 from Outerspace
Damned Compound
4What Unintelligentgenius said
lol
I was dissapointed actually.
mistranslation
You'll tear us apart if you don't watch it
Oh Hai Room conversation!
The Room gives me a excuse to drink this wisky
Heh, one of those... fair enough.
4prince-dari is also correct
The room is amazing and yet abysmal at the same time
Maybe cause it's DAY ouitside
I've never actually seen The Room. I'm... cautiously optimistic.
pointless scenes like buying roses
I would have gone with Star Wars Holiday Special.
I DID NOT HIT HER I DID NOT
4Silverscreen: that's because dari is the chatroom
The Tommyisms are brilliant.
Yeah...The Room is honestly a bit of a predictable choice.
OHAIMARK
11Raindrop: you did it wrong.
i'm marc
For some reason I always seem to hit some key other than Enter that makes me post before I'm done writing.
what's the running time on this?
lol
trust me
You seem like the EGG spurt
Is there even a copy of the Star Wars Holiday Special in existence?
11I did Naught*
9 01:43 hours
I've seen it.
I vote Star Wars Holiday Special
8somepony had to pick the room eventually
not offical
It's... *shudder*
I DID NEIGH!
I always hit the enter key accidentaly
8it was inevitable
i vote G1 pony movie
11GabeMoist: That never happened.
Would it even be possible to get a copy streaming?
or often I do this\]'/
9BronyPeanut that's just cruel
11Bronypenut: that never happened.
13xD
submit it to the ponychan thread
8agreed, no more spoilers about the room
You can find the Holiday special on the torrent sites
movie ideas
hmm
were it my way, the good movie would be castle in the sky by studio ghibli
I watched it once
It was meh
nah
9The Last Airbender is a -Z movie
the last airbender SUCKS
Never saw it, never want to.
13The Village.
way too bad
Last Airbender, lol!
Ali G in da house for A movie
Don't make me live through that
9Manos: We should watch it as the MST3K episode
last airbender is a F------ to me
Dumbest twist evar!
I was clearly kidding. We talked about this last week, remember?
There aren't enough letters in the alphabet to describe the Last Airbender.
Maybe with rifftrax?
11MST3K would be good to watch sometime.
SHit's gonna go down.
freddie got fingered
Come on guys.
Alrighty.
how about Birdemic
9that said
4Prince of Persia wasn't...terrible
i couldnt watch last airbender
Be more creative

8suddenly, murder
0U-S-A
0U-S-A

suddenly gunshots
Lol, everyone dies BUT the horses.
9I should ask him if he'd like to stream for this channel
phantom bullets
Needs more killing
Such good aim you have with an inacurate weapon
9NO PONIES WERE HARMED
8dont shoot the ponies!
13Isaac Shark is always streaming.
and this is my weapon
INCREDIBLES
Hax!
wepon
I loved DBZ and I refused to watch that...
I second NickOnimura
That machine gun has like no overheating or anything does it.
pew pew
Advent Children Complete was pretty good.
AIM ASSIST! HAX! HAX!!
No ponies were harmed in the making of this movie.
MU-MU-MU-MULTIKILL
8HE SHOT THEM WITH WEPON
11The Last Airbender makes the DRAGONBALL movie look good. And that's saying something.
and none of the horses died. the end
This gun doesnt make them shed blood
I want to see Birdemic
@starpony That's a good way to put it
did i get kicked? did I do something wrong?
m-m-m-monsterkill

0Whistling at his destruction like a baws
what's the name of this film ?

I'm noticing a lot things that it looks like RDR took from this movie
9DAT ACCURANCY
Rubio is a ballin name
and nothing of value was lost
Since they stole the gun from the yanks, they can probably afford it :-p
No survivors
i wanna bet >9000
what's Gidorha?
mib_47shug: Fistful of Dollars

Yes.

Can't wait for Ramon to show up.
He whistled the BGM!
I think that cigar is a whistle

Unlike politicians

11He just wasted a good sip of booze.

0wow really Brushtail I didn't know that

No but I want too
No such thing as a good sip of toxic waste AKA booze.

CLOP TILL THEY DROP

Celestia would be dissapoint

It's a western, the plot's not hard to figure out. The good guys shoot the bad guys, the end.
xD
8Glass_arm, dems the rules, I'm not going to argue with you about them
PWND

>Implying there's good guys in an eastwood western
how did he know that would knock him out and not just annoy him?
4There are only anti-heroes in Eastwood westerns
lol exact spai voice
11There are only anti-heros in westerns period.
EPIC SOMBRERO
in good westerns, at least
Anti-hero is, sudden deja vu, anyway, anti-hero is just a subtype of hero.
4Silverscreen is correct, I've played RDR lol
8I need Clint's hat
8immediately
its called the antagonist
11Hipster: Good taste in hats.
13Cntrl + Mousewheel

Wait, when did the movie turn into a cover-based shooter?
this is the best rodeo I have ever seen *eats popcorn*

this requires popcorn!
8Fun fact: this week's pony episodes feature the 2 best songs in the series
...wow he reloaded fast.

this popcorn talk is making me hungry
and thats why you use the fronteir justice
I agree with Hipster_Brony
Moi
4Hipster: Partially correct
Dual screen is twice as nice
>implying winter wrap-up was good
he has slight of hand pro on
The night of the triffids - evil Fluttertrees everywhere.
0Cupcakes song isn't in either of those episodes!
nah i hated night of the triffids
11> implying Winter Wrap-up was good.
very
4Winter Wrap-Up WAS good
8winter wrap up is the best song by far
PATWANG!
Winter wrapup WAS good
agreed
pew ptang pewwwwww
THAT was a bang!
Baxters can't shoot to safe their lives. Literally.
I thought winter wrap up wasn't a very good episode, but that's just me.
HAHAHA
Lawl
p0ne....
Winter Wrap Up is brilliant
11How dare YOU! *PhoenixWrightPoint*
why does no one know to aim AHEAD of the path of the target?
p0ne, Y U NO LIKE WINTER WRAP UP
8cowboytj, i hope you mean ironically

13Ever.
I don't want to have ponies ruined for me
8beard: nope.avi
11Hipster: Not banned, just don't spam them.

where is the drama i dun see it
because it's srsbzns
deer gawd
Fluttershy would win
were just talkin
.......well THAT was rather anti-climactic
OhboyClintEastwood
everypony is best the pony.
13lol
0Everypony is equal in my eyes, but Fluttershy is more equal than the others.
The entire budget of the film went to buy poncos and cigars for Eastwood.
13Rarity. Nuff said.
need budget when you mute, right ?
how about predictions for Season 2?
Money well spent Turni
Dr. Whoof is best because he could abort the mane 6 from time.
Luna has emo hair. And have you been to /chat/? That's why she's popular.
Luna is cute ill admit ^_^
PLOT TIME
Rezo: That is going to be amazing.
is 100% amazing
Season 2: No more CMC, Nuff said
agreed
Master_Beard2 you disappoint me
back
8pone-zone
uh no (Gabe Newell)
uh, no?
8i would say no
maybe
probably spike for me
8not very furry knows about ponies
I'm sure there are at least some non-brony furries.
owlwlicious can take his place.
I'd rather not get into that discussion. Have you seen the furry hatred on EqD?
a furry it can be pony work !
not every furry likes this show
0I gotta take off have fun everyone
Dumb logic on my part then
lol
how many times is he gonna drink from that empty glasS? XD
the plot isn't even complex, how can you be lost?
Working freelance has it's atvantages.
11Do NOT start the Furries discussion, please.
ok
11NO FURRIES DISCUSSION.
"drink up" ok
Spread sucks man.
medival times= old mares tale
11We don't need longwinded debates here.
I'm surprised my computer hasn't crashed - It's been like 5 minutes since it has
9DAT HEART

ooh, a heart
aw now tinman has a heart
oh hai der
8guys, please stop discussion of furries
11Yes, please.
13^Agreed.
8its only going to end in rage
As the ancient Mexicans said
4Keep everything civil everybody
I still think we're mature enough to have this discussion.
THE FIRST TIME WE SAW THAT ARMOR IT WAS ALREADY FULL OF HOLES
shouldn't you aim for the head?
I think we're being civil
11Both very nice guns.
naw
Buritos > Nachos?
I know taht
8it starts out civil, but it never ends that way
HAHAHAHAHAH
trixie might
I hope not

AHHH HAHAH HA HA HA WARIO!
I don't
WAAARIO, HAHAHA

Trixie>Gilda
9IS SMASHED
Clint Eastwood is about to get raped.
4DCD: *brohoof*
sadly that is dirty .
4That was pretty good
I can stand Trixie more than Gilda...only slightly though
I made an image of rainbow dash wearing a trixie pelt to show my hatred to her
8DAT FLUTE
dat flute
4 >Clint opens his eyes, flue plays
herd mind
oh. faking it. of course.
<3 Dat Flute.
clints plot detector, it makes a flute noise
4 >Clint does ANYTHING, flute plays

4Clint Flutewood everybody
When the flute plays, you die.

I've given up on trying to figure this out
hey there

8when you hear the flute... run
They just don't make films like that anymore ;_;
you dont die when someone plays the flu *urk*
clint flutewood?

9This is pretty easy to understand
flute fluteflute
Hypothesis: Clint smokes custom-made flute cigars
damn time zones...
13Derpy is becoming Canon Curb
Derpy is supposed to become a secondary character
flute
papa, why?
an episode about derpy would ruin her
wow
because he is the main character stupid kid
Derpy has to stay background, imo
they are now planning her background appearances
we won't get a derpy episode, it was already stated she'll continue being a cameo character
nothing ruins anything
That kid is pissin me off!
except people complaining
an ester egg, nothing more
CowboyTJ quite possibly...
Derpy is becoming a character
