I remember having an iced coffee with a crapload of sugar and I was just off the wall.
/me dances to the music, like a baws
pfft, i was drinking when i was 16
they never checked my ID
/me had some hard cider when he was 16, didnt like it

I've never had beer, though I've had a bit of wine, wasnt too fond of it.

I've seen each of the three prequels once.
I wont go to 3d though
Yep haha. I loved it!
to be correctr
I approve!
XD
yeah
3D, in my opinion, doesn't really work for Live-Action. Cartoons work in 3D because you can suspend disbelief.
Oh noez i haz a schoolz 2mrrwz
NOO
sucks for u
Yup.
School sucks
Yup.
0_0
In live action, it's hard to suspend dat belief (snerk snerk)
