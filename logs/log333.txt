Ohey OneTrickPony, do you have one song?

yup
why do so many people hate country ;___;
I don't mind country actually.
I dont hate it
I have nothing agaisn't country.
because its boring
becuase its annoying
Though I like classical
I'm sorry to say,but it is boring like trance
Its not my favourite genre of music but there are a fair few good songs
/me is listening 60's music
because they don't know new country
06classical <3
ScootaChicken: Because rock 'n roll > country.
because Luna loves classical
the only country music i will listen to is Johnny Cash
06inb4 I play all country from now on
XD
06c;
It really depends on what kind of country it is
thats a given xcanox
c:
Play some classical :3
13oh my
cause 70's rock that's why
Country is alright.
Wubstep?
but yes classical is great music
OneTrickPony: '60s > '70s
Metal is best music
CCR ftw
Megaman?
CCR ftw indeed.
Yup
Dat megaman remix
Guys, pick a pony.
hmm 60's is okay
Quick
Iiiii am megaman, and here is my plan.
I love Old music "Put on your sunday clothes there's lots of world out there~!"
Go!
Um...
80's-90's is best
Megapony
reminds me, I had a list of 60s bands I still need to listen to
Dat rap
CCR/Golliwogs
dat megaman <3
What do you mean Megapony doesn't exist?
should i play megaman?
Yes.
cracker?
Yes <3
the 60s was best musical decade
Of course
Then quake afterwards
ever played any of then games?
megaman? boooring
the 80s was pretty dire
Beatles, duh
ive got all of Chopin on my player right now
80's-90's had Hall and Oates......

XD
I drink normaly lightly like tonight
but I'm too sleepy and drunk for sanity now
i drink... alot... and i need some right now cause i dont like reality or hangovers
I had whiskey once it burned!
I dont like the smell of alchohol
Midnight_Tempest: what if reality was this <<<< ? :3

just smelling it makes me dizzy
yea

Wine tastes like weird grape juice to me
There we go, problem solved
my internet works again
kinda
yay!
SkilledSkillet: it IS weird grape juice. In a way~
glad to see its fixed Phase4 : 3
really?
Wine tastes like crap to me :\
interesting note, this chat and the stream are using different connections
^
yep
red wine is good white wine is bad
That is interesting
Lol, depends on the wine :P
no, i meen internet connections
im not a fan of wine, there is only a handful of wines i like to drink
All wine :\
OneTrickPony: agreed~
one is through bronystate network, the other is through ponychat network
i have 2 (kinda)
Ive never had white wine
/me bets that Phase4's internet will unfortunately derp again in 5 minutes
oh XD
kinda like how all coffee taste like dirt to me
I know right?
Sweet smelling dirt!
but god do I love the smell of coffe
I hate cofee
/me recalls being drunk for drinking alot of wine and well, he is knocked out the moment after 4 cups of it.
DB_Brony: its derping now still,
Roxsnow, 4?
Ive never truly been drunk.
Phase4: So I already lost the bet...
ive been drunk, its a wonderful feeling
I remember having an iced coffee with a crapload of sugar and I was just off the wall.
I forget : x... but I recall laughing alot and well going to a bed and sleeping the whole night Starflash : x
DB_Brony: well not realy, depends on how you define derp
/me dances to the music, like a baws
You remember going to bed. Notdrunk
/me thinks taking a trip is better than being drunk
Technically I'm not supposed to be drinking yet so thats why
pfft, i was drinking when i was 16
Im 14
they never checked my ID
/me had some hard cider when he was 16, didnt like it
-_-
inb4 people shamelssly say their age
I've never had beer, though I've had a bit of wine, wasnt too fond of it.
SkilledSkillet: Same here
Phase4 I'm English the only cider is hard cider :p and I do like it
*facepalms*
Dumori: same here in aus
booze is one of those things you wont like at first, but the taste gets better everytime you try it
Dumori: we call soft cider apple juice
You need to have beer before you can apreciate wine LadyCanary, because after you've had beer, wine actually tastes good by comparison :p
/me was 8 and accidentally drank some hard alchohol thinking it was chocolate milk
when my friends got drunk for some reason they kept laughing about the name mary loo retin
yup
/me has never gone near the stuff afain
Fleur: whoops

It was
Indeed
/me would dance if she was not sick in bed. .
Pshh, my father gave me a margarita at Olive Garden when i was 9 -_-
Well, when I CAN actually drink I'll have a little bit, but I sure as heck wont go overboard
And NUUU Viii D:
and lets just say that I didnt hold down dinner that night :\
Thought it was funny
I drink mostly spirits and beers and ciders
Well... ... idk -_-
oh and wine

rum is good
Ponies like cider

Untill we all die from partying!
"is there any way to fix a broken heart" is such a great quote to use at times
Eurobeat is #3 on my favorite songs
what Fleur said
Phase4: I think I had a laptop with that many fake Network Adapters
Fleur I'm liking this idea!
NullRadix: whatever for?
and seeing as some of us dont drink, that may take a while! :D
something to due with setting up VPN's. Some amount of poor programming was probably involved as well
untz untz untz
Mwahahah~
aatz aatz aatz
i like the original by alex.s more
NullRadix: just a bit poor
06wut
JamesIsABrony - THIS is the original

Alex. s... damn it vi
13so my family just got back from thrift store... und... mom tells me she saw a purple pony with braids and a bow on its tail
good remixes though
meh Alex S. is too mainstream
06Definitely
06Nothing wrong with it!
13und she said she was this close to buying
06X3
OneTrickPony lol
hello
You should have told her to go back and get it! :D
well isn't that the definition of "remix" not an original song?
hhmmmm... i like "luna remix alex.s vs. eurobeat brony" better
^I do too
13who would that have been though
oh look
literally the first artist I hear of any genre I think is too mainstream
13doesn't sound G4 to me

Nice :)
its the raven!
cue the Lavender Town music.
/me 11,01takes Shizuka to funky creepytown.
The tapping is me I'm hitting my head on the wall

13now in this light... the guy looks like a cross between george clooney and brad pitt
well duh its underwater whos gonna hear it ring?
DERPY!
13a watched noise never pings
So, it's Derpy?

/me giggles.
I just wish it didn't give me blisters so i could do it more often
Makes sense
Hey LadyCanary
the sound is a seapony clopping.
wont you take me to...FUNKY TOWN?!
Hello EmeraldChocolate!
neat, http://youtu.be/9YF4uMesUHw got uploaded
Hello!
You know what is also a good anti depressant? Being me. Then again, maybe I should try running. It would be the Big Bang in my head. :D
11,01Either torpedoed or collided with the object.

11,01Down below, someone's banging a wrench on the ship, trolling the crew.
You scared me there
/idonevengetthis/
lol
probably derpy
looks like vince vaugn
Ponies did something weird to me, I've concluded it's overall positive but it wasn't entirely
It's the trotting of his hideous hooves
Ghosts are real oi guess what
its just such a mess in here.
It's me
oh noes Google chrome crashed
i liked speedy speed racer better
of course maybe it was all positive put into a different perspective
OrangeJuicePony did you close a youtube link?
yes
A friend o mine went to work painting was in the botom room and a door opens slowy by itself and then slams right in his face goes in noone there and the windows cant open
same thing happens to me
weird o_O
It's probably Trollestia
IKR
lol
nononnononono, stop freezing....
Underwater door is best door
Poor Guy
perhaps it should suffice to say I'm not longer content with where I was
Dken2021 it's been happening to me too :\
then never talk to us again
Really it was my brother in laws friend
good thing he didnt go into the closet. molestia might have been there
I feel sorry for that diver
all he is missing is a red shirt
Ictiv: "We interupt this broadcast to tell you that everythign is fine. things are all fine"
lol
I work as a cook for a hospital. I work at nights usually so I tend to hear some creepy stuff every now and then.
^
Wait what diver?
I've had to use IE app to prevent it from crashing
...
If he was could we tell
nice video
true
EmeraldChocolate: the soon to be dead one
Gotcha.
oh really molestia? maybe you're the one who has been gotten.
its magic...

The seaponies will help the diver

"was tha unicorn"
NullRadix: I have a weird phylosophy: Cavemen were happy when they were living in filth but got to be tribe leader. Ancient Greeks were happy if they belonged to the 5% known as "The Free Man". In the middle ages, people were happy when they got a little farm and shat outside in a hole. Later people were happy when they got to have more than 2 changes of clothes. Now people are happy when they don't have to open angry "Pay us" letter
that*
Woah
/me starts shivering
That got bigger than I excpected
sweet relief
lmao
you know what would be fun to see? starting this song mid episode when the episode airs. dont do it, of course, but the reactions would be hilerious
13"SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO" "was that you McCleur?"
Still, the epimyth is this:

Ay I keep hearing Troy McClure.
You see, they can share a little something wirth you
Oh and hello to all~

hold on
VioletVanilla: Nevermind its one of the remakes
06any better?

00,10Noooooooooooooooooooo /val

VioletVanilla: The episodes name is Eye of the beholder
/me hugs VioletVanilla.

13X3
People help each other, for free!
0,5WASSAP
aha... but do you see what I see? I have a case of what I've dubbed 'epicitus', or the desire for things to be greater than they currently are. I see a great fandom, powerful, but still inherently divided. I see potential, but don't know how to harvest that potential, especially in a way that would resist corruption.
something random http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYNHDMXuuAQ

If there is anything more amazing than that, I'd like to see it!

Lookie what I found: http://www.navsource.org/archives/10/16/160714.htm
For there can be no corruption. The challange is not to defeat it, but to reveal it!
My ears....:'(
13so saxy... they were a bunch of ghost otakons?
It's the page for the ship 714 from WW2
lol

0,14Whip it?
nice find Nyria
what are you?
Under the various forces that are viewed as corruption (Cupcakes, Rule 34 etc) are bad ideals... But when you just turn around you will see this:
0,14I hope they whip it good
ohey thar LordCelestia
I dun get it
Whip it good!

Turning the content upside down on itself (R34) bothers me, but for the most part it doesn't end up in front of you if you don't go looking for it

and youl see more as you go further in the game
Oh noez i haz a schoolz 2mrrwz

Yup.

Serious question time: just got into MLP, enjoying it quite a bit, but I'm wondering about how and why people get drawn into these idealistic shows (it's certainly happened to me before.) Perhaps more interestingly, what are the consequences in your life. I know for someponies feel hugely suported by the show, but as much as I love it it almost feels like a huge complete distraction from the things in my life that i want to accomplish. Thoughts? t

Shizuka: why must you mock me?
Great.....AND a rarity chat.
0,14that sad feel when you're gonna get a new game in 2 days
13because also it's "free rein" not "free reign" because reign implies you can do whatever you want anyway
0,14but have no XBL to play it on
Hello new home page.
I'm getting a new game tomorrow :)
/me never gets anything but ninjaing and mockery from Shizuka

Dark Souls. I'm excited and scared at the same time
So don't have to pay for online services
:D
0,14...
trololo dari
Midnight_Tempest: it's nowhere NEAR DBZ length, with NO "POWER-UP for 5 minutes" scenes and little filler. There is character development as well.
Dat feel when you learn something awesome.
What if Fluttershy used the Stare on another pony?
emantrollslayer: Oh noes, are you going to slay me? :<
Fluttershy probably cannot.
0,14in all honesty, I can't wait for that game
