Sagas the Nazi policies included a continental plan for Europe and a political ideal for Germany, sharing some Nazi ideals doesn't make you a Nazi, as a matter of fact many people advocated limiting reproduction amongst handicaped people and still do today

Silverscreen: lol
hey sergio_scriptor
/me is still sleeping on Bronysith's shoulder
I gotta admit, the ending to Toy Story 3 brought a tear to my eye. It didn't get my nose running. So I'd consider the conclusion to Pixar's epic trilogy about half as awesome as about half the episodes of One Piece.
I dunno. That thing doesn't give receipes, just what to use
hmm?
Has anyone here watched Deathnote?
/me grabs some gatorade and buffalo pretzels

SuperBrony64: Rythym heaven fever is pissing me off
...or were they matchsticks?
Is it supposed to be black and white?
Yes
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The film's shoestring budget is part of the reason it was shot in black and white. A number of different types of lighting were used, and this would have required a lot of post production to resolve issues related to the varying color temperatures. With black and white, this isn't a problem.
I WANT THAT DOG
Was this movie made in the 30s? D:
Says Tabitha was Wendy O Koopa from the mario bros cartoon
Pinkie Pie swear

Hahaha.

MaidSurge: i mean teh smurfs in space movie
That dragon ball movie... was god awful
this is TERrIBLE
so much...lag
Well, my screen says: "Friday movie night:21hours, 5 minutes ago."
Freefall29: There was no Dragon Ball live action film
live action was the first and most crucial mistake. it was friggin live action
Bronysith: That's a pretty meh movie too
has anyone seen avengers yet
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Clerks is loosely based on "The Divine Comedy" by Dante Alighieri hence the name. Also, there are nine breaks in the movie to represent the nine rings of hell.
0,14me, twice
SaxyPretender: iron man or thor? or whos your fac?
fav?

yes Custard
Mmk
This parts pretty funny
Thannks
Silverscreen: a divine comedy movie would be alot better then this crap :|
The hell is this?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The "smoker's lung" that the Chewlie's Gum rep slams on the counter is actually a calf's liver thrown in dirt and burned with cigarettes.
Dante's Inferno was awesome. The film and the game too I guess
The acting is so horrible except for the main characters :D

OH YEA
O_O
11,02Nah sorry, 1 hour 39 min
Swearing!
dafuq am I watching
oh we aren't watching Haw Jones?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: This is the first film in Kevin Smith's intricately interconnected View Askewniverse series (the others being Dogma, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and Clerks II). The movies are all linked by characters, themes and events and each contains numerous references to the others.
seems legit
fuck this fuck that
I never get the point of the two guy standing outside
:D
SuperBrony64: Way to scare the shit out of them :D
Silverscreen: i love jay and silent bob strike back
what a shame the budget couldent go into writing
How long is this movie?
so much bad words..O_O
Gangsters don't even say fuck that much...
Bronysith, do you think Disney is dumb for making an Avatar Land at Disney World then? Espically since it won't open until 2016, will people even still be talking about Avatar then?
....Am I supposed to hate those two? Because I do.
we will fu** anything ? even a lyra plushie ? :|
There is a Clerks II? Is it any good?
Who the shit picked this?

Go commute yourselves
yay!
sagas It's a continuation, but it's in a different place because the QuikStop burned down. It's not as random (it's got a bit more of a plot), but I think it still keeps that wit and humor.
lol
Is this woman dense or something?
The acting horrible, completely unknown actors, story is stupid... , no humor
DOES ANYPONY KNOW HOW LONG THE MOVIE IS

"Cleverbot took part alongside humans in a formal Turing Test at the 2011 Techniche festival at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati on September 3, 2011. Out of the 1,334 votes cast, Cleverbot was judged to be 59.3% human, compared to the rating of 63.3% human achieved by the actual humans. A score of 50% or higher is often considered to be a pass of the Turing Test."

He was arrested for homosexuality and sentenced to hormone treatments.
O baieverypony!
10Yes
CoalDust you wanted to know
So he was both persecuted AND prosecuted.
10I want to try the other flavours though
i did?
twilight_sprinkle: because he was gay, and was forced to do hormone treatments
oh... thank you
DocSane: Yep, he was treated lik shit in a court of law.
Hormone therapy isn't the solution. He needed therapy.
^
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: hm ok
Kak.
twilight_sprinkle: also it was illegal to be gay in scotland
The solution was that homosexuality shouldn't have been a crime.

Gays are awrite

Marriage.
I don't think it is.
It's a crime of nature.
Yes, but the Supreme Court struck those down.
its a crime in religion
homosexuality may seem wrong, but the best thing to do is just let ppl do what they want to do
Not to mention Alan Turing provided an incalculable contribution to hte war effort.
I think the Supreme Court struck down the last of those laws
11,01I don't think so.
i think
it's illegal to get married in many states, i think
!pokemon
It's a crime punishable by death in a lot of Islamic countries.
We have some terribly backward states here, though.
o-o
Kandarihu: =/
Well, feel free to talk, you seem real happy to do so. :P
"Sodomy' Laws exist in several states, but are basically unenforcable.
I don't like the term "gay rights". That sounds like there should be special rights for gay people. They should just have the same rights and the same duties
well why would gay marriage be legal and being gay would be illegal :D
11,01I think homosexuality is legal.
true. marriage is illegal in most US states, but concensual gay conduct is legal in all 50 now
2!pokemon
Ran, you are a 3Sunkern.
Nittany_Discord: mmhmm
Homosexuality is a crime against nature, but feck nature. :P
There are laws that are still around in the States, but they are not enforced most likely
It's not illegal to be gay, but several states made sodomy illegal.
No it's not, but feck that
DocSane: Well, there are some US states in which it is legal to have sex with horses, but not with another person of the same sex
in some stats it's okay to do a cow....
6.28
and a crime against religion
Well, it's legal for homosexuals to get married, but in most states, they have to marry a member of the opposite gender.
but religion is stupid
It's 23 here in Argentina

it isn't really a crime against nature..

If you don't hear from me in a month, send Link.

Well, the problem is that where gay marriage is legalized, pastors are forced to conduct the ceremonies despite their objections.
It proved that homosexuals can be just as miserable as hetrosexual people! YAY!!
Homosexuals are gay
COMPLETE AND UTTER IDIOTS
Ah.

And then all the girls said I'm Bill Nye the science guy.
SuperBrony64: did you want to stream somthing

Kurra: those words don't exist in the conservative dictionary

YouTube: Louis CK on Gay Marriage
Celes_Chere: it's a boring scifi CG movie
08,01yeah, my router just deecided to derp
pony_132: pretty sure he doesn't give a damn either
08,01anyhoos, i'm having internet priblems
Can... u... f..x ..he b...uf......er
Everyday I'm herp a derpin
08,01so i'll hand over to SB
otakon: believe me I know what it is, I was just surprised someone picked it at all.
AgentKalim stop stealing my thing!
08,01i hope you enjoyed my rambling, really badly put together bollocks about computing
i engoyed
Hey, I enjoyed it. :P
it
Celes_Chere: Caramel AKA ValTheJean picked it for A, he's been picking a LOT of "questionable" movies lately.
Welp! Back to Megaman Starforce 3
08,01otakon: how's it questionable?
2,14 questionable...
it's always great to listen to someone excitedly talk about their passion!
08,01the plot's a bit hokey
08,01but it's a decent film
otakon: define "unquestionable"
gosh i cannot spell or type todays
2,14 you have just destroyed my faith in humanity
Caramel: you keep picking HORRIBLE MOVIES!
Golly gosh gee willikers
2,14 ...Aquirre was ONE movie
Caramel: it's SPIRITS WITHIN, the movie that KILLED A STUDIO
2,14 one
Because spirits within is kinda crappy ? :(
and Aguirre was nucking futs!
The computer: I don't know what went wrong :(
0,14Aguirre was good
2,14 All of my other picks have been totally fine
GilDash: at least Advent is fun
Because Spirits Within is not good enough to be an A movie.
Spirits Within didn't make any sense
Advent Children are cool <.<
Caramel: what were your other picks?
2,14 don't like it? Deal with it, you don't have to watch the fucking stream
That trailer for Rockman online looked so good... I wish it actually got made
Gentlecolts, you can't fight in here, this is the war room.
2,14 and I don't need to sit here and listen to people berate me for my pick
I know.
I don't mind watching it, it's fun too watch bad movies :D
Caramel: dude, calm down! I didn't mean to rustle your jimmies with it.
and he's gone
aw he left
lol
I had my jimmies rustled once. It was awful.
Well, since its buffering i am going to get new water. Because i don't got a well in my cave.
08,01i'm here
awww:'( i have tp leave thanks for thehours and 46minutes of fun :)
I didn't mean to upset him

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXrymV-Lgtw&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397&index=46&feature=plpp_video
otakon: val has been out a lot lately
hey, has there ever been a time when mods won all the picks of the lottery?
6hours*
Aw man, he actually picked a really good movie as well
Buck. I missed the chance to ask him for spiderponies
twilight_sprinkle: yeah, but I didn't mean to piss him off
and just recieved hate for it
0,14eeenope, Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
otakon: heh, ironic
Some people really need to grow up sometimes
Ugh
I hate spazzy bosses alot
Chrysalis: it's not really that good a movie man
/me just finished watching Korra finale.
I mean..
Chrysalis: it was the Avatar of it's day
Spirits Within makes a great case study for those of us in animation, and could have been good if they had changed a few things. I kinda like that someone had the gusto to pick it. That's all I'll say about that.
:(
It's the internet.
CriticKitten was it good
08,01otakon: hey now, avatar was very enjoyable
damn, now I feel like a ass
0,14ah, the Korra finale
Spirits Within... sounds kinda not worth watching
08,01because DAMN, those aliens were HOT
KORRA FINALE IS BEST FINALE
I do not like having to fight a boss that moves around at the speed of sound
www.internettrafficreport.com
Internet, lol internet
alexxm: There were really good parts....
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: not better than Sozin's Comet
08,01twilight_sprinkle: but they were!
And then....
I think we're all going to watch it... just that I cannot promise you'll like it.
stream died
otakon: fien
There are a lot of flaws in that movie.
There were parts that make my spirit BURN WITH RIGHTEOUS FURY
oh. Avatar by james cameron
08,01i wouldn't mind a 10ft tall blue catman sweeping me off my feet, i tell you that
Hmmm Chrysalis in avatar blue
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: finale? already?
Because of how much they piss me off
Randomnerd: oh, I'll watch it and enjoy riffing on it here.
So I'd say it's a "meh'
twilight_sprinkle it was awesome
I loved Final Fantasy Spirits Within. I dunna unnerstan' why everyone RAEG :[
finale overall.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Oc409vdJwQ&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397 Go Crimson Dragon music for the win
Kurra: no one raged, it's just a boring movie really
Kurra: it sounds so uninteresting
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: isnt it soon? its been like 15 eps?
goddammit I gotta apologize to Val when he gets back
twilight_sprinkle thats a good amount of episodes to stop
Oh really? I gots rage from people years ago, is all.
this is my fault
Well, lemme rephrase.
08,01twilight_sprinkle: they were basically cat people
Pools all set up. I'm back :(
Hello everypony :3 No stream>? D:
Cat people with USB cables
Ponies47: Val left angry
BroKnee: it's coming
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: yeah i guess. suddenly better than the first season ending
Kurra: It's alright. I do enjoy some of it, but I think the rage was it had nadda to do with the Final Fantasies before it.
08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: cat. people.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: *certainly
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Lemur people
otakonOkai :3
otakon: Why? :(
The Korra finale was "meh" overall. It has some good redeeming qualities to it, and then it has some parts that....well I'll be honest, are terrible.
I need to see Korra anything
Ponies47: I was making a big deal of him choosing apparently "Trolling" movies for stream
you think I woulda seen Korra.... ;)
Ponies47: and well now I feel like a right ass for doing it
And it seems that some of the questions brought up through the first season are pretty much abandoned and never answered.
Who wants some Slashman stage on guitar?
So yeah, for a normal show, good finale. For a follow-up to the Legend of Aang? Yeah, it doesn't hold up.
*Le wild ad appears*
CriticKitten: agreed, kind of weak compared to that
i remember them as lizard people
otakon: I feal like a (squee) right now to. :s
08,01twilight_sprinkle: i'll admit, i might be the tiniest bit straight
CriticKitten: it was the first season =/
XDDDD
Ponies47: why? you didn't do anything wrong
05http://i.imgur.com/B5GVt.jpg
If theres's anything MLP has taught me... it's made me a hell of alot judgmental about what interests people
oh hai Wrek
VAL COME BACK!
Is anyone streaming at the moment?
I'M SORRY!
Apperently....
ANyone want some Slashman stage theme on guitar?
alright enough about catmonkeypeople
Oh fail i did !then.
I've had lots of good conversations with people I used to write off as gross.
08,01MasterBoss43: just a bit
otakon: I'll tell you when I get back in a few min :(
Darkts3: The first season of Legend of Aang did a great job establishing the world, its goals, its main cast, etc, and ended on a high note.
@Satern arent we all strange here, (or at least i am)
im strange
im a creep
er
boom.
you know what time it is when no one is streaming?
ADVENTURE TIME!
One thing that pony and furryness has taught me.... you can be straight, and enjoy hugs and cuddles and good things from anyone, if you're willing to open your heart. <3 c:
Everyone is strange, some assume it some don't, but everyone single person is.
YOutube link to ponies time!!
Hayeayaeyayah?
Bed time?
The first season of Korra ends with some serious questions left unanswered (likely never to be answered), only established one location in the entire world, and hasn't really pinned its cast down very well.
otakon: dont worry its not you, he gets angry very easily, like you :D
twilight_sprinkle Creepers arn't really just from minecraft, don't hate letter me. Love and tolerate.
and also, how to rave. |3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWuJQl24aU&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397
It's definitely weaker than its predecessor. Still good, but....significantly weaker.
MasterBoss43: hate letter, haw?
twilight_sprinkle: yeah, but I don't like making people angry...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1QyDhLj5hU
I feel your pain otakon :(
CriticKitten: lots of Questions that are asked in a tv show will be answered.
CriticKitten: like what? I must have missed something here, I got NO unaswered questions
i meen im a fan of thomas the tank engine to the point that i can name the year that he would have been built so, yeah im strange
Unless it's supposed to be something where thare are no easy answers.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1d5d7yiSYw&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397 I love this Megaman X2 Boss music remix
otakon: Like how the hell does that nonsensical logic of Amon work?
Everytime is feel or i think i might have done something wrong or made someone upset, i'm feel terrible
otakon: eh, val gets angry very easily, so dont kick yourself around for it
CriticKitten: hate doesn't need logic
the title is not what it looks like. It's actually hilarious. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qomos5A1BFE
Questions like "Who is Jon Snow's Mother?" will get answered.
The reason they give for his "skillset" does not make sense.
CriticKitten: I can explain that easy enough
/me is avoiding spoilers for the record, or trying at least in case people haven't seen.
CriticKitten: yes it does
CriticKitten: same here
No, it really doesn't.
PM TIME!
Questions like "Is it wrong to kill a man you're sworn to protect if he's dangerous" will never get answered.
Not only are his powers illogical, but how they work is even less logical.
/me flips a table
...sorry, I'm reading "A Song of Ice and Fire" right now.
I'm on Book 3 :D
I love this story! :D
XD
Hey, someone might help me with this, one time Bronystate streamed a MLP YTP, that used the hearts and hooves day episode as a source, and sweetie belle says "Cherilee's a whore" at some point, anyone remember the name of that one ?
Anyone ever play Megaman Zero?
Randomnerd if your talking about the lannistar that killed the old king conserding he was mad i think he did the right thing
Narolas: its called Friendship is Fabulous
http://imgur.com/gallery/YFqtr
YES ! i love you Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
alexxm: Yes, but I'm saying there's not always an easy answer
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: All the hugs of the world for you
Narolas: :3

That poem

08,01okay, one of you come and kiss me and i'll prove it
otakon: Somewhat. Still annoyed at how it played out, but oh well. I'll just have to accept that it wasn't going to be better than Legend of Aang anyways. I knew that going in, disappointment's an evil mistress though.
Wrek: oh god

Oh god those loading times in that game...

08,01Sumica: yes
Someone owed Netflix some extra data back
Sumica: that was BULLSHIT! I even waited 14 SECONDS before posting that is NO WAY POSSIBLE OF BEING another 6 in 10 KICK YOU ASS!
08,01it looks like it is
Where is Mica Pony?
Sumica: You know I think it is.
otakon chill.. it's a script
BLEH!

SO MUCH BLEH! 6_9
WIIIIII
ponibas: it COULDN'T BE! I only entered ONE MESSAGE after a FOURTEEN SECOND GODDAMN WAIT! Sumica thought that was funny I'm sure...
:(((
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG not mips this time
I think my console may be broken
Spade-Magnes: which one is it?
It makes alot of noise when a area in a game loads
I was pretty alright with that.
My black wii
Dken2012: i know
Spade-Magnes: odd... have you cleaned it lately?
Apperently it cant handle being on for several hours
Lets play wii bowling instead :D
loading
Spade-Magnes: clean the vents
Spade-Magnes is it in a place for good ventilation?
I think Netflix is just down
It has an open space
otakon it still counted from what you had typed in from when you got the auto kick from Wrek.. it was less than 10 secs befor eyou came in and posted again
that is why you got rebooted
You sure?
00,10Sure bitch at me for using a 6 in 10 when you were kicked for a 5 in 10
Let's play the Wii's sword game :D
Dead Space
Because it makes noise whenever a area of a game loads
or when i bring up a game menu
00,10how about I just set it to kick if you speek?
lol
Sumica: your auto kick kicked me after a 14 second gap I COUNTED GODDAMMIT I WATCHED IT COUNT UP
11,02Oiy
o3o
:O
Spade-Magnes odd, what game? or does it do that with multiple games?
Lawl Newtflix.
Dken2021: multiple
lol..... come on :(
wii facehoof
I have to keep the sound down when I play certain games on my GCN. Sometimes, the disc reading stops working. And I hear a *click* *click* *click* *click* as the laser is trying to find the right bit. And if I don't open the game cover and close it again, it'll crash.
Sumica: sounds awes- "User has been kicked"
its gotten louder
It started happening after I played games on it for several hours in a row
Spade-Magnes it coud be your disc drive, but I'm no expert on it
Spade-Magnes: you need to clean your vents man and run a laser lens cleaner in it
why does net flix hate us
UUUGh
Spade-Magnes: that should help
otakon: you actually watch your word timers?
My disks have been geeting scratched for some reason
Meanwhile: you startin?
Meanwhile: that time I did, I waited so I WOULDN'T be kicked then it kicks me WAY after the message got posted
I think it may be cracked a bit or something..
Spade-Magnes: Invisible Cat
Spade-Magnes yea, sounds like something's in your disc drive
Spade-Magnes: do you store it flat or vertically?
00,10yeah it's a script otakon and there are 6 servers on this network we are not on the same server there is a delay.
The only game that averts a crash assuming the disc to be invalid without that is Twilight Princess.
No. :I
I think the black one is a sideways flat modle
otakon: Man you're just unlucky.
Sumica: a 5 second delay on a message that had a 14 second gap?
just makin sure
:O
SONY
PS3!
occasionally somepony will be kicked for _1_ message in 10 seconds, due to irc server lag. Everything hits someone at the same time, so the script triggers.
I did not know SuperBrony64 had a PS3
PS3!!!!!!!!!!!!!
HOLY CRAP
SuperBrony64: playin ur ps3 i see
it was less than 14 seecs from when you posted last, got bootd and then came back in and posted again
/me passes out
Play some uncharted 3
Lol
PC>PS3>XBOX 360
^
hai every brony!:)
11,02PLEASE WAIT
hai FlutterBitch
ponibas: no, BC I PHYSICALLY BUCKING COUNTED THE GODDAMN SECONDS PASS
00,10at least heny freaking gets it
Bronysith: of for the LOVE OF GOD do not start a console flame war here
/me dances on SuperBrony64 s head
I cant belive the thing is pretty much busted because I just played games on it for several hours in a row
Let's not start a console war, please
Hi, FlutterBitch
08,01hey all
Shamroc: ill do it for the love of molestia and i will not war
okay, sure, you're right.. you're always right
THAT was 10 seconds
whats the movie we're watching?6_9
One does not simply wait.
ponibas: dude, in this case I am
00,10hey otakon remember when we used to ban for geting kicked too many times?
Meanwhile: isnt startin for once its amazing
SuperBrony64: I think Netflix is just outright down man
/me simply waits on Meanwhile s head
Clearly, he has no net connection. Oh, wait...
THERE'S A FUCKING MOTH ATTACKING ME.
I mean the Owners manual for the console doesnt mention anywhere that leaving it on for a long time can damage the console
Sumica: yeah I do, since you know I've been PLAY KICKED MULTIPLE TIMES FOR TEH LUZ
Meanwhile use a lighter
Meanwhile: Use your Slap attack
hey im back, what did i miss
KILL THE MOTH WITH FIRE!!!:[
dat awesome wifi
Dken2021: I don't smoke.
I am sad now....
Quick! Copy his WEP key!
Meanwhile: good man
darn I was too slow
Meanwhile: id rather have a sweet treat
CoalDust: Netflix is dead apparently and Meanwhile got attacked by a moth
Spade-Magnes: Why? :(
Ponies47: My wii console is pretty much dead
Spade-Magnes: Dawwwww :<
Oh hey, Spoony's been fired.
5.1 is a lie
I noticed
oooh! My burgers are almost done. :D
I was like "wait, seriously?"
Spoony from That Guy With the Glasses
Yes
CriticKitten: NO! Not Spoony! I liked him ...
Wait, what's his WEP Key. I need to build a satellite array facing his coordinates to get free wifi
Spoony from That Guy With the Glasses?
CriticKitten and I say it's good for him
what?, ok i am up to speed in the kind of way that leaves me lost i gess...
Yes, that Spoony.
Yeah.
Any reason given?
Netflix JUST FOR KIDS!
Leaving the console on for several hours should not damage the console
They're trying to claim it had nothing to do with the Lupa incident, but I'm not fooled.
otakon: Eternal hellfire, for kids.
Spade-Magnes: it wears out the motors
>_>
whats this?
otakon: That awkward moment when DBZ is there. 6_9
What supplies does this give you in Counter strike source? B32 B62 B63
Well it would be nice if the manual mentioned that
ok so i guess we are wathcing netfix
hahahahahaha
He has a point XD
CriticKitten: Lupa incident?
That oddly makes some sort of sense
What's this? An actually good point?
You fucking bitch
The funny thing is, he's right
Cannival.
Spade-Magnes: clean your vents on it, store it horizontally and clean the inside with a laser lens cleaner
says the fat bitch
Louise you aren't helping
Okay. That daughter needs a spanking.
CARNIVALª
How do I clean the vents?
XD
Narolas: eeyup, we care more for what we do to the DEAD than we do to the living
lol
Bad 4G?
well that got out of hand rather fans
no
fast*
Spade-Magnes: dry toothbrush to GENTLY clean the vents on the system
lol
It's orange! What now? :[
hahaha
and seriously, health inspector had, what, 30 other violations in 5 minutes? He doesn't even need the cannibalism charge
So how will a laser disk cleaner help?
There's technically nothing wrong with cannibalism, except the fact that biologically it's not really the healthiest thing for you to eat
DocSane: Spoony made a tasteless rape joke, Lupa freaked out about it and wouldn't leave him alone even months later, and she's apparently good friends with Channel Awesome's head of HR.
lol
Nice self esteem.
so much lag on my end :'(
bob's not that fat
Sumica: you still there man? I apologize for getting my jimmies rustled over that errant kick
Meanwhile s moustache >Bobs moustache
yeah, he is pear shaped...
Stop talking to the restaurant
CriticKitten: And he never issued an apology?
CriticKitten: well hell, that sucks
So basically Spoony made a bunch of very stupid comments, a couple of CA people did so too, and the whole lot of them are scum.
wat
thats good
CriticKitten: well damn that sucks though
He's still got his own website.
otakon: so how will a laser disk cleaner help?
00,10Oki, no worries otakon
He just won't appear on TGWTG.
sagas: Milo is funniest Bender
CriticKitten I think he needs a break
yes
Spade-Magnes: it takes a very little brush on a disc that cleans debris from the laser lens
California is annoying like that
Sumica: Milo is the funniest bender
IDAS: Meh I guess so
wat
The fact people consider cannibalism horrible it's because it's always linked inconsciously to murder, like aborigens killing people to eat them later
xD
sagas: remeber in ep 10 of korra
Grand Re Re Re RE opening
Dken: It might help, yes. But some of the comments his "friends" on CA made about him were pretty tasteless too.
IDAS: yes
sagas: he says the most silly things
/me 11,01dusts otakon
sagas: u shall see in the season finale
Narolas: well, not only that it leads to horrible diseases
also Im not sure they black wii is supposed to be stored horizontal
No wonder the poor boy's depressed. With shitty friends like that, who needs enemies? >_>
IDAS: already watched it
lol
Spade-Magnes: well, the thing is storing it vertically can cause the disc position to slip
sagas: the finale?
brb
otakon : Yes, but that's not a reason to consider cannibalists "monsters", that justs makes them stupid
IDAS: yes
sagas: ill pm u what im talking about
Practicing WITH WHO?
Narolas: indeed
"Hey, we want to eat human flesh burgers!" :|
its wonderfull
dat UV light
lol
these kids are HORRIBLE
ok i am disturbed

I liked it
anyone else?
Human flesh/10
/me dances on SuperBrony64 s head
11,02Next episode?
not a bad show
I give it a solid 6.5/10
Bronysith: we got bbq pork and beef in my backyard right now
One dude on TGWTG went so far as to encourage Spoony to commit suicide, apparently....uh. Yeah. I hope he's fired too, or I think my brain just burst a vessel. :|
/me picks up DeathStar and gives her a big hug 'Hai :3'
Pretty good. First time watching cheeseburger/10
Bronysith I always crave a burger or steak
SuperBrony64: sure!
have to admit not bad
or chicken
Next ep! :$
when this came out, I didn't like how fox advertised it as the new simpsons
What did I give Clerks? 6/10? This is better... 8.5/10, perhaps
/me hugs SuperBrony64 back 'hwi ^^"
That was pretty good, i might like this after all, it'll grow on me
Can't believe I never watched the show, its pretty good
Woo~ :)
/me glomps SuperBrony64
Allo DeathStar.
hi Meanwhile
CriticKitten: wait, he got all of this heat over a BAD JOKE? really?
I'm so happy! :D
/me glomps DeathStar
otakon: Yep.
otakon: Yes...
According to IMDB, the building to the right of Bob's is a couch gag. It changes every episode.

DocSane: that was a good show

hey thats just like my parents befor people come over
I loved the episode where the Rennaisance fair fought the sci fi con.
Channel Awesome can kindly go fuck itself AFAIC, their people are being just as immature about it as he was being over the joke. >_>
CHEWBACCAS
they always clean like crazy the day befor
CriticKitten: apparently yes
CHEWY
It's like a bunch of chewbaccas
CriticKitten: that's a shame I like that site too

Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: this show is actually good though
She's cool, but really, come on ... she's trying to be Meg.
Meg reference had to be done by someone

LOL
CriticKitten: yeah

HE'S A HORSE!!!!! (Or her)
she would like ponys
I'm being too quiet. I'm enjoying this.
it would be cool to have a secret passage
Figures, too. Linkara's the smartest among them.
By Solomon Rushdie
otakon: It doesnt make sense, if the manual told me to store it sideways, why would the disc still mess up?
lololol

MLP will have six seasons probably http://bronies.memebase.com/?p=120710
Spade-Magnes: a creative media L3 btec diploma, game pathway
/me breaks free of Bronysith
Freefall29: It looks like the system32 folder has a lot of important files... Are you sure? :s
Biglaw: BEcause all the others did
MasterBoss43: Yeah. When I went back to the table they asked me 'What was that all about?' I just said 'Ah nothing' I said it all calm didn't get scared at all :P
Bunny_Maid_Luna: BUNNY! HI! :)
Biglaw: we can only be so lucky man
Biglaw: :(
I highly doubt MLP will last 6 seasons
RainbowcrashNBurn: Man that sounds like fun I wish I could do that
TAKE US TO DE ISLAND
mitmaking it could be worse :/
Ponies47: Sup? *Acts gangsta*
Do not jinx it or pinkie pie will get you
WHY SUPER WHY
Custard: I was joking the whole time. I didn't think you take me serious. if you delete system32... your pc will crash since it needs system32 to run. it was an old internet joke
I see you're gangsta.
Biglaw: You forgot the movie
I'm pretty gangsta myself.
Season 3 is gonna be the last, it would be too expensive for The Hub to order any more other than that.
/me facepalm
Custard: DO NOT DO THAT!
Bunny_Maid_Luna: *Puts on sunglasses* Nothing much. B)
I can't wait for Pikmin 3
I'm lucky I didnt do that
LOL IM SAFE XD
AJIsAwesome_: get out of here
AJIsBestPony: that kind of sucks but it was good while it lasted
I need to beat Pikmin 1 however...but I suck at it
did you really believe me Custard?
So chat. I hear your like mudkips.
water
Barbetos: no, no we don't
Barbetos: I like Squirtles
it'll be fine if you format C:
I like Snivys
seriously, WHAT started the whole Mudkips thing?
Ponies47:*Puts on Glasses too* Cool B|
owlicious: STOP THAT!
otakon awww, not even a little?
:(
Custard: do NOT listen to them about that!
THROW THE TINY ALIENS AT THE DEADLY CREATURES IN AN ATTEMPT TO FIGHT! Yeah, that'll work...
Why?
rm -rf /* ?
I mean, nothing is official yet, so we might get another, but shows get more expensive after three seasons because they have to pay the animators more
otakon: Didn't delete it yet :)
If MLP did go six seasons then the quality would go down and start sucking in the last two
Custard: C: is your main hard drive, if you format it you'll delete EVERYTHING on your PC
laggy
Dude the show is popular
Bunny_Maid_Luna: eeyup B)
/me nods
JESmith71: That would be sad.
owlicious: brb, entering that into terminal
Try to have hope for it...jesus...
Custard: i'm just not gonna play old internet jokes from the year 2000 on ya
Is there an option to set all of them on fire?
oops
bum rush the giant one!
you have to be root, i think
Set ALL of them on fire.
Freefall29: ...Ok.
Custard: just don't listen to ANYONES advice here about PC maintenance unless they're a mod
BUTT RUSH
Gah lag
ASS RUSh
tis thine only eay
Barbetos: If your a girl maybe :p
the mods are trolls sometimes
I know I'm gonna fail again,but how do I join another chat? :$ I don't know crap :$
otakon: Mmk L)
Barbetos: Gyrados would like to have a word with you
:)*
Magicarp ftw
So sudo rm -rf /* ?
Well, if anyone tells you to delete System32, it's obviously not sound advice.
who said that season 3 was gonna be the final season... somebody in chat said it
I have a question :$
Eztio: The term is "ass rush" or "plot rush".
i love counter strike and tf2 and l4d and l4d2 for no stupid iron sight aiming
I mean, would you guys rather have MLP end while it's still good, or have it keep going on and risk a drop in quality?
Freefall29: AJIsBestPony IIRC
Boss rush
otakon I'll just preoccupy him with my golding and run away.
fowardslash join #channelname
imagine if MLP went for as long as the simpsons have
JESmith71: end while it's still good
RUSH HIM WITH YOUR ASS
Im not going to buy what anyone says unless its legit
otakon: is it true season 3 being the last season?
Rainbow: I still prefer bum rush
Biglaw: NO
I'm back! Is it Pikmin time?
JESmith71: I rather it not get canceled and stay good
i dont know why, but for some reason my norton protection softwar is blocking EQD
I have a question
I gonna fail anyways,so #Spike
There is a good chance that it will, nothing is certain
Freefall29: don't know
We don't know.
Custard: shot
Bunny_Maid_Luna: fail what dear?
Nice to know alot of you dont have high hopes for it continuing
You know the drill. Shower be back in a few :P
Gah, my stream is derping.
BEAT THE PLANTS TO DEATH
A lot of animated shows don't go past three seasons or they have to pay animators more, fucking unions
Flower!!!!!
D:
It grew a puberty?
Rainbow: eeyup
Well, if that EMP happens, it will be. Not because of any plans of Hasbro, though.
otakon: Is it possible to add a little heading thing to the top of a chat?
Drinks the nectar and becomes more powerful?
AJIsAwesome: I am okay with animators getting paid
Captain Trollimar
Custard: only if your a admin
okay back :)
what is the game even about
otakon: Ok so any chat if you're admin?
What is that noise?
?
BREAK DOWN THE WALL!
the internet would not be able to function properly without new pony episodes
tigher1001: paying off debt
That's why they renamed Aqua Teen Hunger Force, its technically a completely differant show
tigher1001: leading an army to it's death :3
KILL THE WALL NOW :D
Custard: dude, the mods are usually the admins
tigher1001: Invading Earth
Are they headbanging that wall?
tigher1001: Throwing defenseless creatures at deadly monsters.
LOL
die Pikmin! DIE!
AJIsAwesome: aqua teen hunger force was good
koolaid man... go!
Rainbow: yet they manage to WIN somehow
ATHF was hilarious
rainbow: seemes legit
STOP MAKING ME LAUGH
the sound...
Beat the wall!
I AM CRACKING UP
The Aqua Unit Patrol Squad or whatever it is is dumb
XD
Do not listen with your eyes closed
otakon: So, if you made a little chat thing like #Custard you could add a heading, because you made it?
I never really stopped Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
11,02O.O
OK WHO'S PLAYING THE DRUMS
Custard: yeah, but don't since your not supposd to
tigher1001: lol
slaughter slaughter EVERYTHING!
otakon: Ok :3
SuperBrony64: your listening to it with your eyes closed arent ya?
SuperBrony64! I'm back! :D
This osund makes it sound like a brainwash
...then again MLP won't really "end", just FiM. Hasbro would probably make an G5 after that
It was the longest-lasting of Adult Swim's original lineup.
Am I the only one who can't stop listening to Pinkielicious?
JESmith71: I wonder what it would be like...
Can i see Melee
The pikmin are like ants.
/me blinks
/me puts on stupid hipster glasses
kinda scarey really.
SuperBrony64: Are ya getting my messages?
hey everypony
Pik mini
I am waiting for Derpylicious
JESmith71: generation 5 is gonna suck if they turn it back to the old generations
JESmith71: Do you think it would have the original ideas or the same characters?
*regrets
Oh yeah, something interesting. If you kill the enemy while it's in themiddle of eating your Pikmin, the Pikmin will survive.
100 pikmin rule
lol ejecting seeds
I bet in the last episode the CMC get their Cutie Marks.
/me hit himself
/me ears twitch at sounds
I bet they aren't.
wat
Was somebody impersonating me?
Rainbow: Final episode it is all a dream from when Twillight tried to birth the dragon
BRB :D
they will never get their cutie marks. they have no other purpose in the show for plots
Pull defenseless creatures out of the grounds.
Rainbow: Rainbow Dash better become a Wonderbolt or tables will be flipped.
Rainbow: YES.
Sweetie belle's is obviously singing i think
I mean, would Hasbro try to make it like FiM and try to repeat its success and try to copy it in further gens?
scootaloo better not get her cutie mark
sorry for the wall
Spitfire: and he forever regrets it
if scootaloo does her special talent should be orange and/or roosters
laying as Olimar, the Pikmin 1 Easter Egg?
they carry the corpse to the strange divice
Well, if Rainbow Dash becomes a Wonderbolt, she might not be able to be part of the mane cast anymore.
Popular background ponies should become side characters who speak.
and get turned into cupcakes
mitamaking: typo
And fanon will be ruined forever.
tigher1001: NO
derpy should become the element of loyalty
:p
lol
Woah lag!
Rainbow: has to be careful doing that
or of muffins. I'm not picky
Muuuuuuuffins
owlicious: Element of derp
owlicious: nu uh D: im the element of generousity :3
I mean it could end with everyone's dreams coming true. RD being a Wondebolt, CMC getting cutie marks, etc
derpy should become the elements of muffins
i feel sad
I know that.
e_O what is that!?
hi Derpy_Hooves
rainbow: lol srry
Lyra: Element of HANDS
Vinyl is best backround pony
hi Derpy_Hooves

Derpy_Hooves: technically im number 2 but thanks

11,01Ponies have bad memories apparently.
I wouldn't say plot is reset, just Ponyville is full of jerks
if i had a pound for every depressed cell in my body...i'd be rich...:'(
and for one in the chat
Nittany_Discord: IKR
why are all these pikmin following this guy?
Also people seem to forget their own princess luna...
P4NGYA: he's a god
P4NGYA: Power
^
But Luna is my favourite Princess
I say we need more Luna, Derpy and Vinyl episodes.
AgentKalim: Is there any other choice?
Luna is best gamer
as long as spike gets his episode in season 3... i'm happy.
11,01Nightmare Moon turned into a cannibal creature a year after she was defeated.
Nittany_Discord: no
What
Spade-Magnes: the S2 luna episode shows how smart Lauren's Writers are =/
no
not the best. Ultimate
They had a freaking celebration and luna was there, yet they still think she was nightmare moon
Eztio: just type their name and ur message. if u hit tab when putting in the first few letters it will auto-fill the rest of their name
I am a fliposaurus platyhuman made of hand-moist douche-punching Charlie Sheens controlling a crack Sweetie Belle while eating a marshRarity.
turtlegod98: where i am it dollars
Spade-Magnes: ^^^
Spade-Magnes: old myths die hard?
SuperBrony64: go back i see a strawberry :3
and even the mane 6 thought she was nightmare moon...the buck?
JAM IT IN THERE
Pinkie Pie didn't
11,01Rainbow: Trousers.
Spade-Magnes: Not Twillight and AJ
she was just messing around
otakon: NICE AND TIGHT
OH NO HE IS TURNING INTO ETHER CUPCAKES OR RAINBOWS
MahBoi777: tyank you
Rainbow: that was just............just wrong
Actualy i think Applejack thought she was nightmare moon
Where was Rarity in Luna Eclipsed...
Eztio: no problem
Nittany_Discord: Batman picklesauruses.

tigher1001: *sob* Thank you.
2 Pikmin are missing
agnohcyrrehcyrrehcmmihc
Rarity was going to be in luna eclipsed but the clip got cut for time
Rainbow: they really should do a joke if a giant monster made of chocolate/coco/whatever is on the loose.... it picks up rarity
pick them up?
Just saw a report on sex offender laws in FLorida - holy crap
well pinkie could just eat it
<3 music
Rainbow: chugga-chugga-chugga-CHUGGACONROY

Freefall29: THE SMOREZZ
LIKE THE SMOOZE
Eztio:i clean with wubs
can i listen to discord?
okay, WHY do they have to leave at sundown anyway?
BUM BUM BUM
I DON'T CARE
teh SCHOOZE
I love this music
Because monsters
otakon: i think its because at night there are a lot of monsters
then it be giant spike vs smorezz. godzilla vs kingkong type of gith
the predators become active
fight
Im listening to fluttershy cheer in multiplew languages
i'll dog the graves
nu ; A;
otakon: the most dangerous monsters come out at night.
multiple*
it's like minecraft
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: so? be a MAN! like in Dragon's Dogma and FIGHT THEM DAMMIT!
Of course
FIGHT THEM UNTIL DAWN!
everything is like minecraft
ahhh such great music
Jappleack
otakon: again, im number 2 :3
Or the final episode of MLP could be that it's all in a character's mind:
Sweetiebot
http://bawwbot.net/pix/775.jpg
they should do another giant spike sort of thing. that was cool
You're about the size of a dime
never felt so depressed
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: huh? number 2 why?
I'm back :P
otakon: im on my gaming comp :3
hi Ponies47
le moop
It turns out it is all in Derpy's snowglobe
as long as i don;t hear chicken Scootaloo and Applebloom
Also I love how Celestia does nothing to help her kingdom with issues
Really, where's the "set them on fire" button?
Spade-Magnes: the monsters in Dragon's Dogma make you look about the size of a dime in comparison
Cutiemark Aquistion program
Hi MahBoi777 :)
Meanwhile: I wish
MLP ending should be about Twilight reading a book to children
JESmith71: THa... was sad. :'(
human i mean
Cutie mark acquisition program
Ponies47: how are you?
Meanwhile: advanced spaceships...NO WEAPONS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES WITH
chuggaconroy's most feared enemy: THE WALLYWOG
WTF?
lets ship them
...
:D
AgentKalim: SMOOTY SNARKY VADERS
Dragon threatening ponyville? Does nothing
MahBoi777: Fine. My brother is mad at me. :$
300 dragons mabye?
Spade-Magnes: or just send in fluttershy
Ponies47: why?
See ya for now, everypony. Gonna watch FiW!
Spade-Magnes: sent the Wonderbolts, sleeping dragon wasn't ATTACKING anyone just sleeping
set phasers to hug
bye Rainbow take care
bye Rainbow
Still think St. Elsewhere ending with Derpy would be awesome
The smog was a issue
Rainbow: Bye
Chao Rainbow
MahBoi777: He may have amde me blow my fuse and I my have just attacked him outta rage. :$
*made
And its clearly visable from the sky so she should have seen it and done something
Ponies47: dat temper
But no she lets twilight do all the work...as usual
Spade-Magnes: LEARNING EXPERIENCES
Spade-Magnes: She has to get her intern credits someho
*somehow
That put your life at risk?
Celestia COULD solve everything... but then nopony would learn anything.
Jappleack-Forget You I can eat all these apples
otakon: you'd think they'd at least wear protective gear.
AgentKalim: nah she does nothing
AgentKalim: let's go with that
She fought Chyrsallis(sp)....
MahBoi777: He was asking for it. Plus I wanted revange for treating me like garbage alot. :$
Knows Twilight has 5 friends, sends 2 tickets
mitamaking: yeah, and sadly LOST
MahBoi777: For him treating me like garbage
The fuck celestia
i love eating sunseed berries
Spade-Magnes: she's a Princess not a god
otakon: lol she is
Spade-Magnes: she can make a mistake
10% down 90% to go
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: no, she's not
shes a demigoddess though
otakon: That is how they treat her in show
She perfectly knew when they met she had 5 friends
back:)
mitamaking: yeah, but she's not a god
otakon: Says who?
dodedooooodeodeod
Ponies47: sibling rivalry, lol I know it all too well. You'll get along with ur brother someday....I hope lol
She is as much of a god as Apollo
at the end she clearly met all 5 of them!
AgentKalim: good point
So theres no excuse
HEY THERE I JUST MET YOU
ARGH!
AND THIS IS CRAZY
she probably has a finite lifespan
THE SNOOTY SNARK EVADERS!
BUT HERES MY NUMBER
ala the suns lifespan
I'm thinking some of the Flower Pikmin who died yesterday sprouted when they died.
SO CALLME MABYE
LightningDashFast: oh god, please dont' let them run Celestia's death.....
MahBoi777: Problem is he hates about everything I do. The biggest me being a brony. He hates bronies and MLP so much. :s
Er, where they died.
mitamaking: *shrug*
Emotions are what make us human, it's also what makes us change. But can we change? That depends wether you and the people around you let go of the past and focus on the future.
mitamaking: she's a Alicorn and we know NOTHING really about them except that apparently they are all apart of the royal family
I think the ticket issue was another bullshit test for twilight
Ponies47: who's older?
except Blueblood
hes a dick
Spade-Magnes: naw... princess celestia was just being a troll
Ohman that ONE sound the pikmin make. Yeah, you know which one.
What is the history of the Alicorns?
Freefall29: trollestia
Eztio: we don't know
otacon:dont worry she will probably live a very VERY long time after the mane six are gone
DOWN THE HOLE!
Kandarihu: that what I think
MahBoi777: He is. I'm 14 he's 16
hey Bronysith glad to see you in the chat now
I REGRET NOOOOOOTHIIIING
otakon: I did! And now I'm back!
Time for monsters!
Freefall29: ive been here numb flank
Also She's a imortal goddess yet she doesnt know what parasprites are..
All I know is Hearts Warming Eve was before Celestia but she ws still on the flag
Spade-Magnes: she doesnt' get out much
She's trollin
Hey pla theres a chocolate bar over that rail
*was
Change is never easy, but it's worth it at the end.
Ponies47: ah I see, mah bro doesn't even know I'm a brony
mitamaking: it was a prop, and probably artistic license
Don't close your eyes while listening to this.
Yeah
i wonder what she will do when the mane six pass on though?
Let's go with that.
otakon: Pretty big plot hole
Also she never bothers educating Luna on how things have changed
Spade-Magnes: no she didn't
10!pokemon
Skylands, you are a 5Drifblim.
but it's funny
2!pokemon
Staraptor, you are a 10Seedot.
She's obviously a big proponent of trollparenting. Like my dad.
/me sighs
10Team Plasma's theme just got better
MahBoi777: Everypony knows I'm one! Well but for a few poeple like my dad :s
owlicious: If you do... it is LOLZ
only twilight really helped her on Nightmare night
It's never easy admitting to what you are, but once you have their's no turning backl.
10for BW2
Again probably a bullshit friendship lesson
turtlegod98: how so?
Spade-Magnes: seriously though, what good is it to have the omnipotent character solve EVERY PROBLEM? reminds me of Althena from Lunar series
i wonder what she will do when the mane six pass on though?
Dead Pimin
DAT NOISE
I SEE A DPAD!
I know but seriously? Send your sister who has been out of touch for 1000 years and not educate her on the current things
THAT'S A D-PAD!
Once, I made someone into a brony. Also, on the last day of school, I found someone I am friends with IS a brony.
Stone of Glory
IT WAS GREAT
lol IT IS
dat Nintendo D-PAD
Stoner of glory
IT IS NOT A D PAD IT IS THE STONE OF GLORY
Glorystone

Coincidince? i think not
ponibas: Do you live in FL?
I love that game
Also its nice to know that when Twilight who was like a daughter to her almost having been raised and taught by celestia for all her life since she was a foal, needs people to believe her Her mentor/mother figure doubts her completly
tigher1001: truely you are higher than the empire state building itself dear boy
NECTAR!
Ponies47: Do you live in FL?
/me is now watching out! for the Evil Enchantress.
Randomnerd: they'll put you in trances

STOP TALKING ABOUT RAISING A FILLY! I'm thinking of MLD :'(

Alright guys, I'm so tired I'm not even paying attention anymore. Goodnight, it's good to be back, and I love you all.

Spade-Magnes: okay, still listen if you truly examine eveything int he series NOTHING entertaining would happen. so, just enjoy it
Rainbow: saddest story.... EVER
tigher1001: Fallout Equestria was sadder at times
I smell a war!!!!

It distracts viewers and is insulting to the Streamer.
Pinkies4thWall|AFK: I prefer the episode where James has to leave Chimecho behind. :'(

Everlasting_Joy: He meant what game was on the floppy disk

well Imma do some other stuff.
KIRBY!
im in the same situation otakon haha
http://shoptemp.net/products/Supercard-DSTWO.html
11,02MasterBoss43: Advice? Sure :)
The name "Nintendo" is often somewhat erroneously translated as "leave luck to heaven", "heaven blesses hard work", "in heaven's hands", or "work hard, but in the end it's in heaven's hands." A more literal translation is "The Hall of Entrusting Heaven" (Nin = Entrust Ten = Heaven Do = Hall or Meeting Place). A different, looser translation was given as "We work for the people to make the people happy" (from Nintendo Power magazine).
otakon: well at least i went out to get hotdogs....they were good
Dark Pit for Smash 4

im almost pretty far on my game
What if SuperBrony64 did a happy wheels run????

Scoot-Scootaloo: so.. you droped your DSi
00,03Yeah :(
Dying is just a waste of my time! LUIGI, YO!
05Shamroc: all depends on how buggy it is
Wrek..point
It's a shame there isn't any 3DS homebrew yet
I wanna be a unicorn
Scoot-Scootaloo: lites should be cheap now
I'd love to play DS games with better scaling/filtering
kidzrul434: who wouldn't?
05it seems to have equipment and animatiosn now
Luigi! The peoples hero!
Spade-Magnes: eeyup!
05last i ehard of it id didnt have those so

dat dodge
Wrek: If it's not that bad I'd totally like in for that.
U FAIL
Mama Luigi saves the day
yeah
GG!
:D
MahBoi777: :D
Phase4: bc they want us to pay for their ideas and not make our own
Phase4 because game companies don't want you to have the most fun you can ever have
there was DSi homebrew
GJ*
00,02it gets to a point were you're done with the game, mods can fix that
05i mean imagine a party of 2 or 3 with maybe a companion using the difficulty crank aswell
but Team Cyclops died :c
so you need an un-updated DSi/3DS
SB deserves victory for that dragoon dodge :P
00,02otakon, thats why its stupid
Wrek..can i shoot stuff..i dont enjoy meleeing stuff all that much lol
Phase4: eeyup
00,02mods increase the value of a game for prety much free

Shamroc: Sit back with your bows. I have a sword and a shield and the survival instinct of a chip sandwich.
05seems like you still cant name your character
Spade-Magnes: no idea
but yeah, you want a DSTWO? I can send you mine and replace it :P
05it will be named prisoner
later Nightmare
Every character's final smash is based off of something from their series
Wrek: woo! note id prob end up shooting you more than the people we
Wrek: where is this at and can I get in on it
What's wrong with your DSTWO? :P
05otakon: its in the workshop

no there isn't
00,03Consoles <3
Why cant we all get along
Spade-Magnes: It's the internet :(
for one I don't need to update the hardware on my console just to play something
Sessions House 21 Parliament Street, Hamilton HM 12. < Aka Government Building :D
Yeah
> Parents
k
Nice catch Derpy!
I don't need to finagle files or WAIT THREE GODDAMN DAYS TO PLAY SOMETHING
HM12 is postal code?
Game and Watch sounds like Nyan Cat
What has you wait three days?
yeah
I don't need to check if file10001010101010 is up tod ate or not
Well otakon there are those random system updates when you put new games in sometimes
We don't use ZIP
05outdated hardware, dragging down the quality of new games in general. PC to console and vice versa ports that are far from on par with each other. etc etc
00,03Besides, I like using controllers for shooters~
05BUT
...but those aren't much of a big deal
hm
05PCs have similar problem
Spade-Magnes: Diablo 3 now has a 3 day waiting period to access the full game
they want street address/city/state/postal code
The shit?
>state
well
/me Noms on ice cream
00,03MLG octopus~
I have an alternative
Wrek: no, blame that on STUPID ASS PUBLISHERS NOT THE CONSOLE GODDAMMIT
Why cant you play it at the start?
they should check~Spoiler alert~ snake's codecs
Ehm ell gee
k
oh
nah
05the console allowed it to happen
Well

Derpy is truly awsome
Who the schmuck is Marth.
