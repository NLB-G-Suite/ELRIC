Yes, but the Supreme Court struck those down.
its a crime in religion
Saturn: That's gay marriage.
I think the Supreme Court struck down the last of those laws
i think
it's illegal to get married in many states, i think
We have some terribly backward states here, though.
"Sodomy' Laws exist in several states, but are basically unenforcable.
well why would gay marriage be legal and being gay would be illegal :D
11,01I think homosexuality is legal.
2!pokemon
Homosexuality is a crime against nature, but feck nature. :P
There are laws that are still around in the States, but they are not enforced most likely
It's not illegal to be gay, but several states made sodomy illegal.
No it's not, but feck that
6.28
and a crime against religion
Well, it's legal for homosexuals to get married, but in most states, they have to marry a member of the opposite gender.
but religion is stupid
It's 23 here in Argentina
2pi
it isn't really a crime against nature..
Yup.
11,01That's 2*pi
Oh.
Delicious
Yes
circumference to radius!
The diameter.
My body is ready
Two pies
mind blown
11,01I was born on Nittany Day.
I live in Massachusetts, which legalized same sex marriage years ago and learned the terrible truth that it changes society...
I like Pie
You are ranting about how you are not going into rants...
It's alright, mate.
I was born on Pinkie's b-day.
you might want to go into that rant because other wize i probably wont understand
08,01http://tauday.com/
Aside from that, it changed absolutely nothing.
13isn't that tomorrow?
13or wait
136/28
Oddly enough, it didn't cause a collapse of hetero marriage or for people to stop having children.
If you don't hear from me in a month, send Link.
i have it book marked
EXACTLY!
Idiots
Well, the problem is that where gay marriage is legalized, pastors are forced to conduct the ceremonies despite their objections.
Homosexuals are gay
COMPLETE AND UTTER IDIOTS
I think Saturn needs a fez :D
:D
lol
Nick, you are a 13Finneon.
Jaunty fez
While on that note, people are making the same arguments against the legalization of drugs, they were making against the legalization of alcohol. Look where the fucking prohibition got America.
It's okay to be takei.
fez's are cool
2Fishie!
Fezzes are cool.
'pi is wrong'
tau site is bleh
METAL!
And Fezzes are not cool.
Anime?
Let's see some anime!
carls sagan?
Saturn: THINK MAN
Cosmos?
Saturn how about some alestorm
Sarl Cagan
Cosmo is a fairy
That would be awesome~
Bill Nye?
okay, this is really an outrage. I don't know how anyone could bake a tau. Do you put a pie on top of another pie?

i engoyed
Hey, I enjoyed it. :P

it was good Saturn
Saturn: I did, thanks!
08,01otakon: how's it questionable?
2,14 questionable...
it's always great to listen to someone excitedly talk about their passion!
Saturn: Thank you. Twas fun.
08,01the plot's a bit hokey
08,01but it's a decent film
2,14 you have just destroyed my faith in humanity
Golly gosh gee willikers
2,14 ...Aquirre was ONE movie
2,14 one
Because spirits within is kinda crappy ? :(
and Aguirre was nucking futs!
0,14Aguirre was good
2,14 All of my other picks have been totally fine
Because Spirits Within is not good enough to be an A movie.
Spirits Within didn't make any sense
Saturn: Aww, you're going to stop~ It was very interesting to hear you rant~
Advent Children are cool <.<
2,14 don't like it? Deal with it, you don't have to watch the fucking stream
Gentlecolts, you can't fight in here, this is the war room.
2,14 and I don't need to sit here and listen to people berate me for my pick

Aw man, he actually picked a really good movie as well
and just recieved hate for it
Some people really need to grow up sometimes
Ugh
I hate spazzy bosses alot
/me just finished watching Korra finale.
I mean..
Spirits Within makes a great case study for those of us in animation, and could have been good if they had changed a few things. I kinda like that someone had the gusto to pick it. That's all I'll say about that.
:(
08,01otakon: hey now, avatar was very enjoyable
0,14ah, the Korra finale
Saturn: yeah, but it was mostly pretty
08,01because DAMN, those aliens were HOT
KORRA FINALE IS BEST FINALE
I do not like having to fight a boss that moves around at the speed of sound
www.internettrafficreport.com
Saturn: o u :D
08,01twilight_sprinkle: but they were!
And then....
I think we're all going to watch it... just that I cannot promise you'll like it.
stream died
There are a lot of flaws in that movie.
Saturn: well....yeah :D
08,01i wouldn't mind a 10ft tall blue catman sweeping me off my feet, i tell you that
Because of how much they piss me off
Saturn: hmm Man huh :3
Saturn: why catman O.O
finale overall.
Oh really? I gots rage from people years ago, is all.
this is my fault
Well, lemme rephrase.
08,01twilight_sprinkle: they were basically cat people
Pools all set up. I'm back :(
Hello everypony :3 No stream>? D:
Saturn: they were more of monkeypeople
08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: cat. people.
otakonOkai :3
The Korra finale was "meh" overall. It has some good redeeming qualities to it, and then it has some parts that....well I'll be honest, are terrible.
I need to see Korra anything
you think I woulda seen Korra.... ;)
And it seems that some of the questions brought up through the first season are pretty much abandoned and never answered.
*Le wild ad appears*
<@Saturn> i wouldn't mind a 10ft tall blue catman/woman sweeping me off my feet, i tell you that -fixed
08,01twilight_sprinkle: i'll admit, i might be the tiniest bit straight

I've had lots of good conversations with people I used to write off as gross.
08,01MasterBoss43: just a bit
lets talk about sandwichsubponies
Saturn: Well, everyone is supposed to hook up with you. Wouldn't work if you weren't. :p
@Satern arent we all strange here, (or at least i am)
er
Saturn, not even a bit!
boom.

The reason they give for his "skillset" does not make sense.

No, it really doesn't.

Yes, that Spoony.
Yeah.
Any reason given?
Netflix JUST FOR KIDS!
Leaving the console on for several hours should not damage the console
They're trying to claim it had nothing to do with the Lupa incident, but I'm not fooled.

Well it would be nice if the manual mentioned that

There's technically nothing wrong with cannibalism, except the fact that biologically it's not really the healthiest thing for you to eat

Nice self esteem.
Stop talking to the restaurant
wat
thats good
He's still got his own website.
He just won't appear on TGWTG.
yes
California is annoying like that
wat
The fact people consider cannibalism horrible it's because it's always linked inconsciously to murder, like aborigens killing people to eat them later
xD
