03it's a bit tl;dr but yeah
05SirGanjalf: id say its a bit more noticable atleast
theres like a temperature barrier procteting Us
Baltimare always has extreme temperatures and weather, 100 degress one day, 70 the next.
12Its kinda working
I live where the winters are freezing and the summers are way too hot D:
05i think theres a good example of that in the next ep
In buenos aires theres like 100F And here we have 50F
80 degrees average all year round.
12no link to open in wmp? D:
05eew Farenheit
Saipan is actually in the record book if you look for it. :P

In other terms
Celsius is best pony
10C Here and 30C In buenos aires
I am forced to use that unit of measurement.
In summer

Well, if there was someplace around 70, 75 year round, I would drop everything and walk there if I have to XD
it's kind of strange, if the arctic melts, the gulf stream would probably change, and Norway would become just as cold as Alaska
For once. :D

I like One Piece (subbed)
Ow ;A;
Women require time and money (Women = Time * Money). Time is money (Women = Money * Money = Money ^ 2). Money is the root of all evil (Money ^ 2 = Evil). Therefore, Women = Evil.
13Scoot-Scootaloo: they don't force, you accept it
;A;
Since evil is negative, money is thus imaginary.
If money's the root of all evil, why do we have jobs?
to become evil?

1,3sound coming through?

and looks like some civ
00,03Voices O_O
and I hear two people.
13not that i was trying hard..
^
Power corrupts. Knowledge is power. Study hard. Be evil
13galt's speech chapter invalidates the rest of the book, got it
00,03Ignorance is Strength!
Freedom is Slavery
Anyway, whos voices are those?
It's not about "invalidating" anything. It's that it's just a poorly written book that is more interested in preaching to its reader than telling a story.
13it's well known that galt's speech was intended as rand's objectivism dump than as useful to the narrative
who's talking on the stream?
I like 1984, but I'm glad the events of the book never happened in the actual year 1984.
00,03Your eyes betray you, don't trust them
bye all.
Is this Civ?
oh Civ 5
00,03No, its Age of Empires 3
I like ane ambiance in civ games.
I like the ambiance in sid meier's civ games.
That would suffice.
mmm logic
If it's Civ then it is.

but it should be update by mods constantly
They used to have a huge banner above the stream to tell when's the next pony episode coming.
hm
00,10that would require us knowing when the next pony ep is too
http://blogs.adobe.com/brandexperience/2012/05/16/the-cs6-desktop-brand-system/
13which won't be for months anyway
00,10it's been laging the whole way for me

MASS PRODUCTION = The ruin of Mankind..
00,02VDXRetrotainment, i disagree
less humans = less conflicts imo...
00,02VDXRetrotainment, as oposed to pre mass production, where you needed to fight each other for resources
02I use mine for GC titles as well
More machines = more precision.
*human
Yes... Yes it is.

But...it's too hard for me to read off yet. ><
00,02VDXRetrotainment, it is
I don't know below Assembly Code.
00,02most architectures use push/pop instructions
00,02its quite interesting
Aaand 1% of us understood that XD

:P
O.o
00,10it's still just reruns but yeah
04Ohhhhhh, okay
...
:P
*teach
is anything on now?
While loops...oh sh't...
bahdunno!
NEVER use a while loop unless you understand them completely...
I still don't use them
lol
loops are surprisingly loopy
:)
*squee*
http://www.mycplus.com/tutorials/c-programming-tutorials/loops/ <--- Loops(If else for while)
if i had a theme song this song would be it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KFkP9IvLCk&feature=related
No
A foor loop has a end.
A for loop can loop as many times as it's operator tells it to
not if you do it wrong... =)
Well yeah.. of course if you do wrong. :P
I've personally never had problem with loops.
for (i = 0, i > 0, i++)
A while loop is like hitching a battery - pool with it's battery + pool...
00,02VDXRetrotainment, "NEVER use a while loop unless you understand them completely..." o_O
and also should be >= now that I lok=ok at it
00,02one too many infinite loop bugs?
Aye
I'm trying to avoid them as much as possible
I never got the hang of them. ><
I've never had an issue with while loops
00,02you probably want <
Yep
XD
00,02and something other than 0
00,02ah
Let us noobs try and figure this out XD
lol
if anything while loops are simpler than for loops, there's just the condition, where with fors you have three chunks in specific order
for(thisvariable = 0 thisvariable > 5 thisvariable++(or thisvariable+=1))
that freezed stream :D
Hi, everypony!

Hooray for cheap booze and easy mares!
doesnt mean we cant talk bout loops and ponies eh? the maths wont make our heads explode eh?
00,02P0N-3, seems legit
Once you understand how the data formet works, you can build on that to the loops and decisions.
Hooray!:)
00,02aparentyl i'm marked as away
