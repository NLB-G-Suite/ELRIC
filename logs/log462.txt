hardcore D&D

Petrified_Discord: I don't know how, from who?
my heart is still broken :(
Wrek: could you turn it up, or is it my stream only?
why yes Wrek. An entire chapter is pretty much devoted to you
i cant srsly understand how much hype this show got
05this show in a nutshel: sex, violence and cooking.
Ninjazz: but of course it is the official welcome to the herd osng

TheRainbowDash: All of us. There WERE a metric fuckton of bronies in the chat at the time :D
Bronysith: I salute you.

RyunosukeKnT: yes to dnd no to skyrim

Well... Toonami is almost just Adult Swim's anime line up
/me flips table
02"Woman gets 2 life terms for raping infant daughter" <-- something no one should ever have had to say
Ninjazz: That's good. :)
cachi01: yeah, iirc, it ends after Cell arc now.
How are you teleporting around Westeros today, Littlefinger?
I didn't say DBZ would be there. You don't see me complaining Sailor Moon isn't there.
WallDives: instead of 9000 in spanish it says 8000
/me breaths deeply "Right... Good."
WallDives: but in KAI they fix it
cachi01: thats how it was in JP.
Ninjazz: Having troubles?
flutter_spin: complaining? lol i dont like dbz

Oh, hello Midnight_Splendor! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
Ninjazz: I thought kissing was a sign of affection? Or is it a traditonal bronystate greeting at this point~
damn near.
Nyria|Work: Depends on the pony I guess. :$
/me puts GilDash and Ninjazz on a boat and ships them away
Nyria|Work: With Gil, traditional is out the window
/me stares at shore
And this is why I enjoy logging on here you guys make me feel so welcomed.
Whyyyyyy?
Ninjazz: Send a letter to otakon while your ship'd~ :3
you're*
Om: Oh I see~
Nyria|Work: Will do... :|
Ninjazz: Aww... You know I wouldn't hurt you. ;)
Ninjazz: My greeting is always a wave and a hug. Optional to kiss, if the pony wants to, and if that silly filly wants to take it a step further, then we get started...:D
I got cold Kebab as night snack nom!
also, I learned a new word today, yay.
Rofl dummies
GilDash: It's what you would do that worries me... :$

TheRainbowDash: Save the rest for the PM~ Don't want to break the rules and all ;)
TheRainbowDash: Yes, Dashie. I remember every step.
CCCP: Titanic was not on the ship.
WallDives: Hmm, and it means?

/me gives SuperBrony64 4 seals that'll do flipper rolls.
What do you mean AGAIN?!
Woodenfan: Yes, Game of Thrones again, it is an amazing show.
anyway, this has too much sex and not enough Wolf Punching for my tastes, so I'm gonna go back to watching The Grey
hang on
gonna fix up my audio issues
RAWRity: Have fun.
Om: short version is "belligerent", except that Belligerent refers to a group, Bellicose refers to a singular individual.
/me 13is watching cosmos >>
inb4 major dick move
WallDives: I see.
Shizuka: That'll just be translated as the night sky then.
I'm getting such a Assisin's Creed vibe.
Just remember, if you at all want to help promote anime in the US: WATCH TOONAMI TONIGHT.
"the people are revolting!"
Or like, turn to the channel and leave your TV on or something.
RAWRity: WILL DO! *salutes*
there should be a show that has an episode where the main character becomes a prostitute and has sex with a blind guys seeing eye dog
so, a person cant be belligerent, they can be bellicose. Like me, apparently.
13how do i do that rawrity if i don't have tv
U
derp face
Wait, why watch Toonami?
TheRainbowDash: Cause it's awesome.
TheRainbowDash: because its coming on tonight?

Shizuka: break into your neighbors' houses and turn THEIR TVs to CN at midnight.
WallDives: Ummm, I guess so..
Toonami is supposedly on tonight? Huh.
FillyFlam: eeyup. Toonami starts up tonight.
Shizuka: moo

/me hugs Ninjazz anyway
BL? Black Lagoon? The show with the dub that said "fuck" 250+ times in 25 episodes?
You realize that turning on your TV for Toonami doesn't "count", right? That they base ratings on the handful of people who receive booklets for that purpose? :P
Take care everypony, I'll be off for a bit.
bye Everlasting_Joy
05Ninjazz you do that via PM
later Everlasting_Joy.
No, this is proof that Toonami comes back
Hey everypony I'm back!
05i meant asking permission silly
13CriticKitten: i would have assumed with the proliferation of cable and satellite set tops that they would derive metrics directly from that
Oh...
Ninjazz: we all know it comes back. you dont need to prove it.
Oh...
So when's Toonami starting in CET?

I only get Summer. It's hot everytime of year.
05S2E5
Here where i live every season is almost the same
theres 4 seasons
and welcome, back to norway
http://radio.randomsonicnet.org:8000/rn-relay.mp3
03OK ones ec
Wrek: I've heard that season 2 differs more from book that season 1. Is that true?
but winter ends in september in temperature terms
Wrek: Cheers. :)
(i live in S. hemisphere)
AlienEd27: i agree.. Norway is to warm now -.-
03http://forum.digital-digest.com/f145/cd-projekt-drm-doesnt-work-witcher-2-drm-free-version-pirated-less-95783.html.
I Live in the South of argentina
03it's a bit tl;dr but yeah
05SirGanjalf: id say its a bit more noticable atleast
theres like a temperature barrier procteting Us
03"And while at least 4.5 million pirated copies of 'The Witcher 2' has been downloaded, Iwinski was keen to stress that this number has almost nothing to do with lost sales."
Baltimare always has extreme temperatures and weather, 100 degress one day, 70 the next.
12Its kinda working
I live where the winters are freezing and the summers are way too hot D:
05i think theres a good example of that in the next ep
In buenos aires theres like 100F And here we have 50F
80 degrees average all year round.
12no link to open in wmp? D:
Airpuff|Tipsy: u live in aus
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: .. I live in Norway :P
05eew Farenheit
Saipan is actually in the record book if you look for it. :P
^
Ninjazz: Take me with you
In other terms
Wrek: I live in the States though.:P
Agree Wrek
Celsius is best pony
10C Here and 30C In buenos aires
I am forced to use that unit of measurement.
FlutterTree: Currently occupied. :$
In summer
05TheRainbowDash expect the world to cater to you, expect the world to expect you to cater to it
Ew foreign
In winter
-10C Here and in buenos aires 15C
Wrek: Hmmm, I guess so...(shrugs)
Ninjazz: You don't seem to disturbed about that.

He's fat, it helps him in that conditions
Also anypony knows about the perito moreno glacier?
04Well, that's nice to hear.
Om: I'm not disturbed... More like uncomfortable.
Oh snap, that man is a bro.
Perito moreno is the only glacier that is growing in size
http://radio.randomsonicnet.org:8000/rn-relay.mp3.m3u
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Wut? xD

Well, if there was someplace around 70, 75 year round, I would drop everything and walk there if I have to XD
Ninjazz: Hmm, you don't look that uncomfortable either.
Ninjazz: Why so uncomfortable? Oh, I probably see why...
Om: You ain't in my position.
it's kind of strange, if the arctic melts, the gulf stream would probably change, and Norway would become just as cold as Alaska
Ninjazz: You got me there.
For once. :D
AlienEd27: Lets hope that dosent happen.
Ninjazz: Congratz
05probably but the people would adapt
02Breeeeeeeeeeeee

DitzyHooves: yeah sword fights everywhere would be awesome instead of bullets
03use CPUs as an example
DitzyHooves: Comnat would be MUCH worse... Think of the extra effort needed to kill someone.
Fluttertree ah i'm actually born on the west coast of greenland though i'm pure danish and don't have any greenlandic blood in me
05DitzyHooves: i dont. a blade has a higher chance to cause you a slow painfull death than a gun
12!pokemon
DitzyHooves: I wish all chairs turned into computers with internet~
Soital, you are a Kabutops.
GabeMoist: is this true? :)
03in the early 90s, they'd increase by a few megahertz at a time if anything
no
Ninjazz: less killig in the world = better
FlutterTree I live in denmark currently though
03then it went up to like 3GHz, then you get dual cores, quad cores, 6 cores, etc etc
02yeah
the lightsaber is more majestic than the blaster.
well, it does not take a lot to kill, life... is quite fragile, sadly
Gunblades. problem solved you two
DitzyHooves: what this about lightsaber?
Nyria|Work: BUT WHERE WOULD WE SIT? D:
cachi01: Tell that to the world. :(

CrimsonPhoenix: link please :)

O_O
6_9
i have no porn
lol "D
xD
Ryunosuke: We all do :P
lol
05ProudToBeABrony: if a stream isnt streaming a scheduled event, the streamer may stream whatever he likes. so basically demanding different content outside of scheduled events are futile.
Deadeagle: do you not have interwebs?
05Deadeagle: and i cant draw.
A real spy would admit to being a spy.
^
Wrek: i see
Meanwhile: im a spy
Lies!
every mans browser history is in blank if u know what i mean
hmmmmmm
Shamroc: knew it.
lol, bluff
Meanwhile: but for whom
Oh my, that girl....
i gotta delete my history lol
Wrek, not entirely futile
Shamroc: for lemons
05however a man may ask nicely and make a request of soemtihng to show afterwards
Shamroc: for the Welsh.
Meanwhile: A real spy would never have to admit that he was a spy xD
Meanwhile..who?
TheRainbowDash: I know right
05yes GabeMoist: when demanding it is futile
Deadeagle: he ment he cant draw now
three words: Chrome incognito mode
Deadeagle: Out of sarcasm.
Shamroc: the Welsh! The folks who live in Wales.
shamroc derp
Wrek: if i may, i have something i think everyone will enjoy, of course to be shown afterwards
Dang it!! I went to the gym when GoT was on?!?! How many episodes have been played today??? D:
HEY I DIDNT REALIZE!
Meanwhile...i live in california dude
welsh = sheep herders :)
Meanwhile: he spies for the Whales >_<
Shamroc: so you're spying for California. Thanks.
hey guys im gonna leave
You're a bad spy, Shamroc.
YAY!!! SHEEP!!!:$
Meanwhile....and why would i spy for california A STATE...instead of a specific person?
bye ProudToBeABrony.
RyunosukeKnT: and minors!
Wrek: ?
Wrek, if one wanted a streamer (Val) to stream Pre-G4 MLP, they would demand G4
its like im the only one who knows how to delete history in my neighbor hood -_-
Ok, fixed that problem, sorry to whoever had the name I was using, I didn't even realize this name was being used XD
Shamroc: Because you're government employed.
ooo bondage
kinky
Meanwhile...nope
/me raises eyebrow
oh mu
GabeMoist knows whats up
*my
Ninjazz: Why you always must raise your eyebrows every now and then?
listen to the red head she's smarter than u
TheRainbowDash: Why do you need to ask?
^
Hugs.
whoaaaaaaaaaaaaa
dat spooning
:D :D
Ninjazz: I need to ask that, I am slightly confused at points.
Oh mai...
never mind
that spooning
Chilly Butt Fun?
Ninjazz: I know what you're on to. ;)

how cute
sex scene?
employed*
Frozen, but fun.
^
clothed sex
DO HO HO
stupid, butt rave
time for teh butt wreking
TheRainbowDash: Still don't know?
I was Frozen today!
Sneaky but sex
05GabeMoist: not the same. the point at hand is that the streamer decides, and makign demands to change what the streamer wants to stream will only casue the streamer to dislike you. comparing vals troll sprees to chat manners when it comes to requesting content is just silly.
no way
the crap is she doing...
.-.
stop moving
Ninjazz: Yes, a bit.
Shamroc: The fact that you mistook "implied" for "employed"
oh my!
wreked.
Brave people dont have to be smart
Oh mai...
hes not done yet
He must be feeling abit something...
How could he say "stop it" ?! D=
:O
Meanwhile.....yeah i dont know what made me do that
she's trying to get her legs out
FUS RO DAH!
TheRainbowDash: Take it as my way of doing ;)
...is she...is she attempting to seduce him?
Inb4 they freeze due to him having a wet dream
LOL
She knows he wants it.. xD
Ninjazz: o_o..:D
Jon, she's horny, y'know?
well then
but Meanwhile im still a spy
SEDUCTION!
Wrek, Alright then, I wasn't being entirely serious
05but I was
TheRainbowDash: Perhaps I should say one eyebrow :S
And after our vision turned away, they had much butt fun
Wrek: Of course, if a streamer approves of the request, then they will most likely stream it
=/
i missed it
Thats a given
that freeze
why doesn't the streamer with Caramel stream more g4?
For example, LadyCanary requested to Sumica to stream episodes of Squid Girl, and Sumica did so
Ninjazz: Oh, right.....
*coughs*

Hasn't been kicked yet.

sorry
Youre fucked
Shizuka is angry
WallDives: yeah....i'm kind of opposed to mvc3 as well. again, capcom has been pissing me off with their business decisions as of late
*Cowers*

hi Midnight_Tempest
I just really I <3:D
WallDives: i've thought about getting skullgirls, but right now the system is a little bare for it and i'd like to see it further fleshed out first
panda: IRL >.>
besides, UMvC3 is at the end of its sale cycle.
I havent had a scare to top last months Fallout run where I found those Blind Deathclaws :D
Ahhh
WallDives: if i remember correctly, UMvC3 didnt sell that well
ingwaz: then you will probably wait a while.
DeathStar: hai! *glomps*
/me is watching pinkie pie dance
FluttershyDaBoss: then why is your name fluttershy?
Om: i know I was just messing with you, im surprised you didnt scream LASARS!
I just rememberd that kirzstryfe
UMvC3 WTF WERE THEY THINKING ON MAKING JILL A DLC?
WallDives: however, i am so hype for fighting is magic
ingwaz: it met expectations, according to Svensson.
/me hugs Midnight_Tempest
Cause
Deathclaws are incredibly sneaky bastards
ingwaz: going to Canterlot gardens to play it.
Fluttershy Loves RainbowDash
cachi01: jill was dlc from the ver beginning
panda: Don't even try to predict me!
Wait
WHO SAID DEATHCLAWS
ingwaz: not in mvc2
ProudToBeABrony: Meh
One moment you think you're safe and the next you see a scarey ass face
BronyCon: wassn't me!
Om: you are right, you are unpredictable... i wont predict you ending up with gil ^^
Deathclaws? where?!

Fallout FTW
WallDives: :D
/me unleashes Deathclaws into chat.

sorry listening to interwebz anthems
panda: Good, now...SCIZORS!
WallDives: as far as i'm concerned, their definitions of expectations is about as vague and probably full of crap as can be. legends 3 was cancelled because it "didnt meet their specifications"
I'm from the Mecca of m'f'in MAHVAL.

Ok I'm not gonna go all Twilight!
ApollosTrinity welcome to Bronystate, remember no trolling, asking for ponies (This is a BRONY site not PONY site), and no ticking off the mods.

Ponies47: u didnt gave me credit for idea xd

Alicorn_Prince_Shane: a friend of mine likes to dick around nonstop when playing games like say halo or something that allows for exploration, i just want to get to the game, he wants to explore, try and break through the invisible walls, do stuff hes not normally supposed to do...its not a good combination
08,01we can only count to muffin
My wife dresses to kill. She cooks the same way. (Henny Youngman)
Shizuka: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 20 :P
Speaking of Ponies and fillies, my mom wanted to get a mare and a filly

why do I feel like saying om nom nom nom nom
Ninjazz: I've been like this FOOOOREEEVERRRR!
tehe
lol GabeMoist
math.pny: Error: log_muffin returned infinite muffins. Raisins dumped.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: he finds a clifftop area in say halo or some fps and wants to spend 15 minutes exploring it, i just want to progress along the story line...
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I can never get a full serious game of BF3 because none of my friends have(Forever alone) and almost everbody is doing something that does not involve playing the game
that's four evers. that's like Forever!
08,01attention bronystate: we will from now on be using a base-muffin numeral system
Om: Well, keep at it! PROVE YOUR MIGHT!
08,01all numbers should be expressed in muffin-ary
Ninjazz: Ahh, no.
HUZZAH
Om: Lazy.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: i don't mind some dicking around like say playfully shooting explosives at each other when theres nothing else to do, but if its holds me up for a significant amount of time, that annoys me
Ninjazz: So. You're no better.
Om: And why is that? :|
08,011, 2, many, lots, muffin
Ninjazz: Its a fact.
I love you muffins! <3

08,01because everyone knows muffins are better than 6
i feel absolutely bizzare
08,01*rimshot*
Om: *has flashbacks...* I don't hate it. :$
My god...
What have you done?...
Phobos2390: 666 is the answer to all
Ninjazz: I know what I have, but what you did. Well thats something
on the one hand...i feel slightly intoxicated, i find walking, typing, and other things that normally require no focus to actually require some, on the other hand, my thoughts seem to be completely coherent and i don't really feel much different mentally...
L4D2 anyone?
08,01Phobos2390: 13_10 = lots . muffins_muffin
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: So what is 666's meaning again?
What is the meaning of life? 666. No, afraid that doesn't work either.
why again?
08,01i expressed it as a scalar product for clarity.
ingwaz: you've just activated Hardcore mode for life
Phobos2390: it's the number of the beast!
oh. in what movie?
I hope the episode "a derp in the life" is gonna be real. It'd be awesome: A SILENT DERPY EPISODE
Phobos2390: in real life
I doubt it though :(
Phobos2390: its reference to satan
huh?
Phobos2390: in the an awesome song
MahBoi777: haha, its the strangest thing really. speach requires some focus but i still can clearly know what i want to say before i say it, i just have to be careful to choose my words so that theyre not somethign that would accidentally be slurred
never mind
MahBoi777: speech*
ingwaz: lol
08,01inb4 uranus
MahBoi777: i suppose this just reinforces my normal view that i prefer to be sober at all times in order to have proper control of all my functions both phyiscal and mental
wow amazing boss name =/
who else wouldn't want to say to someone: "I'd love to see Uranus"
and oh crap...that thing looks nasty
Ninjazz: What was that with the flashbacks hmmm?
/me turns on 360
Phobos2390: i already did xD
i think its pissed...really pissed
Om: Gildy said the same thing long time ago... o_o
/me starts a petition to rename that planet to urectum, to end that joke once and for all.
ingwaz: sober is best lol
Om: Same. Exact. Thing... o_o
Ninjazz: I know. ;3
Cachi01|GhostRecon: Oh. Who?
Om: YOU BASTARD! :[
08,01Phobos2390: i dunno, i love showing people my gas giants.

Ninjazz: I was wrong to say you were lezbian.
My gas giant are amazing
well hello!
is there a stream right now or is it dead only for me ?
give em a lick
MahBoi777: eh...i don't always understand the things that people do, whether social or personal, so in my attempt to understand it, i have become even more confused it seems
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: there is stream
hello, i'm back
08,01GabeMoist: in all honesty, it's where my nick originally came from, rather than the planet
hi Dark92Enigma
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: : It's streaming
Om: Yes.. It was wrong of you. :|
HI Dark92Enigma
Ninjazz: Cuse you *obviously* like stalions too~
We're streaming? Why it isn't for me?
ingwaz: it seems that being drunk has a reverse effect on u
MahBoi777: i do know that my nose hurts like crap...blasted cut on the inside that wont heal...so painful every time i have to touch my nose
/me tackles Om
ouch
/me laughs madly
L:<
08,01GabeMoist: awesome!
and hi Dark92Enigma!
/me rubs Om's face into the ground "I'll KILL YOU"
M:<
MahBoi777: well, perhaps i'm simply at that "magical area" of intoxication where you are still yourself but think about things philosophically as well rather than past that point where you're wasted and no longer coherent
who is streaming ?
Ninjazz: Don't be too rough~!
08,01GabeMoist: do you have a favourite?
Om: SHADDAP! :[
/me picks up a Karg8k and aims it at om.
Om: wait.....so he's not a lezbian?
08,01GabeMoist: somewhere; i'll try and find them, but i'm a bit busy right now
08,01GabeMoist: i can tell you which ones i've reared, though
just saw the latest Ask Jappleack update. That was...strangely heartwarming.
MahBoi777: Bi, apparently.

Ninjazz: What great reactions you have by the way.
hmm. I should eat. But to eat, I must cook. And to cook, I must first clean dishes. And to clean dishes, I must get off my flank. Damn.
Merc_Xephos: i havent seen you in AGES!
Nope no maintenance here
Om: What do you mean? :|
ingwaz: oh my.....O_o

Nope sorry TheGreatAndPowerfulT

Hen3ry: I know. It's a hard life being in a first world country ain't it
Oh that explains everything
Om: I hate you. :|

/me punches Om's shoulder
Ninjazz: ohh~ So strong you are.

Om: Yes, I have been doing alot of things for fun.
Om: I have... cake.
Are you there Nittany_Discord?
Ninjazz: I had pie.
Om: Not sure where I'm going with this one. :S
11,01Maybe.
I saw your post on Moonstuck :P
pie vs. cake......how epic
Ninjazz: Well, I really did have pie.
i still have my gun
Om: And I don't have cake. :D
MahBoi777: Did someone say cake?
Ninjazz: I guess I win
11,01I got another Moonstuck question answered?
Yep
MahBoi777: Here is a fact. Cake = Lie. Pie = Truth.
Ninjazz: Of course not. The cake is a lie.
MahBoi777: well...i think i'll go lay down now and ponder the meaning of life, the universe and everything
I said that on a TF2 server and EVERYONE agreed.
ingwaz: 42.

It's after your time
Ponies47: I want it!
IMANOOT!
I NEED IT!
MahBoi777: You want you want?
No it's not.
Really, my biggest issue is that, after having Orihime build up the idea that she was going to get stronger and be able to fight alongside her friends, her character ended up just crying for Ichigo (who at the time was pretty much DEAD), to save her.
I'm 25 and remember it fondly. >_>

because rage quit or being a douche?
DitzyHooves: there were more episodes. It just got dubbed by a different studio because 4Kids lost its license for it.

Darwina?
Shizuka: Darwinia sounds good.
do it Shizuka !
If x = 1 and y = 1Then 2(x2 - y2) = 0And 5(x – y) = 0Which is to say, 2(x2 - y2) = 5(x – y)Now divide each side of this equation by (x-y): [2(x2 - y2) = 5(x – y)] / (x – y)Which comes to 2(x + y) = 5But (x + y) = (1 + 1)Which means that 2*2 = 5.
eeeeeeeh
i choose option 3, im gonna play some more Diablo 3
MahBoi777: Huzza!
DitzyHooves: that was because Toonami was dying, and couldn't afford the liscensing rights for their shows.

DitzyHooves: Fariy Tail's probably not gonna happen. Too highly hyped for them to be able to afford it right now.
Women require time and money (Women = Time * Money). Time is money (Women = Money * Money = Money ^ 2). Money is the root of all evil (Money ^ 2 = Evil). Therefore, Women = Evil.
/me cuts OmegaMetroidBrony s cheek
13Scoot-Scootaloo: they don't force, you accept it
would also like if they show Code Geass
;A;
lol Phobos2390
Notice, the only 2 new shows are stuff dubbed on the cheap by Funi
cachi01|GhostRecon: It's great isn't it?
Since evil is negative, money is thus imaginary.
13Phobos2390: there is a problem with your premise that money is the root of all evil
Scoot-Scootaloo: You're REEEEEEEEEEEALLY into this Communism schtick. Why?
If evil is negative than Evil ^ 2 is positive or good so two wrongs make a right and a woman is two wrongs
Scoot-Scootaloo: is a communist DUH
If money's the root of all evil, why do we have jobs?
Shizuka, Atlas Shrugged?
to become evil?
00,03After I read 1984, the world seems to make more sense~
13eeeeeeyup
00,03Dem commies be takin' away all our freedoms Jesus gave us >: (
Can I just say? FUCK Atlas Shrugged
13why so?
1,3sound coming through?
http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/google-employees-create-beer-dispensing-kegdroid/
It's is a horribly written book.
Scoot-Scootaloo: damn commies
Woodenfan: so......jobs are evil?
And the addition: I am nobody. Nobody's perfect. Therefore I'm perfect. But only God is perfect, so A God Am I. Oh dear, I'm blind!
yep sound is live kirzstryfe
yeah MahBoi
I see stream and sound.
wut is dis
and looks like some civ
00,03Voices O_O
and I hear two people.
13aw looks like kirz beat me
13not that i was trying hard..
Merc_Xephos: Sparta
^
^^
Ooh, whos voice is this and what game is this?
I wanted to see gameplay of Civ5 anyway, I liked Civ4 so i planned on getting it.
YOu do not just STOP your story for 60 god damn pages just so you can explain blunt-force-trauma style your entire philosophy to the reader.
Power corrupts. Knowledge is power. Study hard. Be evil
13galt's speech chapter invalidates the rest of the book, got it
Phobos2390: school is knowledge knowledge is greed greed is evil
00,03Ignorance is Strength!
Phobos2390: so school is evil!
ohai CupcakeWarrior!
Wasnt that speech basically the author's opinion or something RAWRity?
/me hugs CupcakeWarrior
Freedom is Slavery
ignorant and happy, or knowledgable and miserable?
Anyway, whos voices are those?
It's not about "invalidating" anything. It's that it's just a poorly written book that is more interested in preaching to its reader than telling a story.
"The more you learn, the more you know. The more you know, the more you forget. The more your forget, the less you know. Therefore, the more you learn, the less you know."
13it's well known that galt's speech was intended as rand's objectivism dump than as useful to the narrative
who's talking on the stream?
Not to mention Rand's writing style is stilted like hell.
CupcakeWarrior: yes.
GabeMoist: me and Kirakura
I like 1984, but I'm glad the events of the book never happened in the actual year 1984.
GabeMoist: me and kirz...derp
00,03Your eyes betray you, don't trust them
I need to get some sleep, see you guys a couple of days.
hay Satern are you still here? I have something relevent to your interests
bye all.
Is this Civ?
oh Civ 5
00,03No, its Age of Empires 3
WallDives came back? And left... Bye then
Scoot-Scootaloo: Which reminds me, I think I still have AoE 2 somewhere
Robert Pattinson played both Cedric and Edward, so Cedric = Edward. Voldemort killed Cedric, so Voldemort > Cedric = Edward. Harry Potter killed Voldemort, so Harry Potter > Lord Voldemort > Cedric = Edward. Edward Cullen is synonymous with Twilight, so Harry Potter > Lord Voldemort > Cedric = Edward = Twilight. Therefore, Harry Potter > Twilight.
I like ane ambiance in civ games.
I like the ambiance in sid meier's civ games.
00,03Welp, I'm off to bed. Night y'all~

Phobos2390: you could just say that the last HP book sold more than the entire Twilight Saga combined.
That would suffice.
kirzstryfe: What era are you guys playing in currently?

Ninjazz: yeah, they've got two new shows on Toonami. Deadman Wonderland and Casshern Sins.
Sweeeet.
If the new Toonami block's succesful, they'll likely get more new shows to bring over
RAWRity: Casshern Sins isnt very new actually
Oh boi
I just wish the damn tapes would get here soon enough. :|
I really should design an Alicorn diety of war

Ninjazz: huh, at least it wasn't permanent
Luna_of_War: FlareChaser would like that
MahBoi777: Hopefully.
Okie doki loki. Now then. Who got banned?
hen3ry: I've heard of this Canada, but we arn't talking about him. We are talking about Lopy, if you ever heard of him.

WHAAAAAAAAT MAID HOURS IS GONE?
Ponies47: why did u unflip table do u see the shit it caused
Its been gone
13http://i.imgur.com/m39l8.jpg
11,01It'll likely be cancelled permanently.
I was unflipped?
Man does Casshern Sins have some Painfully 80's Art Design
NUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
*shoots shotgun into crowd*
/me facehoof.
Shizuka: lawl
inb4 someone makes a private maid rp channel
Shizuka: That image is perfect.
^
Nittany_Discord: what happened at maid hour... did alot of dust get kicked up and some one sneezed?
Shizuka: XD
11,01No.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Why did you flip the table in the first place?
11,01We have a RP rule.
13http://i.imgur.com/fgcR0.gif
Nittany_Discord can I have nice things? Canadians are nice! I apologized when somebody stepped on my foot. That makes me nice, right?
cachi01|GhostRecon: That doesn't seem a lot
Ponies47: cause i wuz angry
11,01And people have not been following it.
Nittany_Discord: how come Maid Hour's being cancelled?
playing roms
Well, im out. Bye everypony!
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: O ok
RAWRity: Maybe someone will make a maid channel
11,01Because Maid Hour is RP, and with our RP problem, it'll likely have to go.
Bye bye bey Galloran
bye Galloran
Rule 3 of RPing in bronystate: It gets worse
Okay, WHAT IS RP?
11,01Maid Hour was not bad RP, but it's not helping our problem
Nittany_Discord: OR CREATE THE MAID CHANNEL°
what is (was) Maid Hour?
11,01Role-playing.
FlootahShy: Role-Playing
Nittany_Discord: prepare for a person to come on bstate
and start trolling
11,01It's not as fun as pretending to be a maid here.
its not me
Shoulda guessed it.
Canadian_Brony: hour where everybody puts Maid in their usernam.
...But without the dice
and dust stuff
11,01We're had people coming in here thinking this is an RP channel.
I wasen't here for Maid Hour
I was considering being a maid... :(
RAWRity that's amazing
we got hi5s as brohoofs, so we should create something for hugs
Canadian_Brony: too bad you missed it.
/me hands Nittany_Discord a cookie
That feel when you'll never get to experience Maid Hour
/me gives 2 cookies to Shizuka
/me 11,01noms cookie.
I was a maid once, then I took to much RP to the everywhere.
Nittany_Discord, if Maid Hour returns you should do a stream of Dust Force
superretroworld I think it's called a "glomp", but I don't know if you guys glomp here
"Ninjamaid" or "Jazzmaid" would have been mah name.
11,01Maid hour is my favorite hour.
lol
We glomp.
We glomp alot.
We glomp.
and pump
/me glomps Ninjazz
teh glomps
And mount.
Oof.
bur most of us say hugs
We mount a lot. :D
11,01I might stream a maid hour if you promise to help people out.
and romp
Nittany_Discord: how u mean help people out
/me bonks Gunthler with a rolled up newspaper
11,01Some people are holding a fundraiser event soon.
Nittany_Discord, you will stream Dust Force: The Official Game of Maid Hour?
fundraiser?
MahBoi777 come to Canada! It's so much better! . . if you don't mind snow
lol
Nittany_Discord: and?
Good one, GabeMoist!
Hi CJ!
Nittany_Discord: When is that by the way?
Canadian_Brony: I love cold weather!
lol
O hai durger!
1.15 am EST, Sunday.
:O
Screw Maid hour then...Day of Maids....
11,01I proposed an idea that if we raised about $2k, I would wear a maid outfit while streaming.
MahBoi777: ikr, totally beats hot weather
LOL
oh mai
MahBoi777 move to Canada, where our 4 seasons are Winter, Still Winter, Almost Winter, and Road Construction
legit
lol
:D
mmmmm bombs you want it? It's yours my friend.
I recieved the sidden urge to donate.
sudden
11,01Problem is, I can't find the money to make that happen.
*
Canadian_Brony: where i live we get the 4 main seasons, your lucky
/me vacuums Nittany_Discord
Raise money to get Nittany_Discord a maid outfit
11,01I need money for an outfit, but I haven't been able to get it.
either way, the roads are stupidly annoying
Sounds like a plan.
would give money if i had any to give
/me hands Nittany_Discord moniez
Everyone! Fund this man!
Well... CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
Everyone, donate
Try Vegas. We have Cold, Hot and windy, hot as hell, and oh [buy some apples] it's hot.
NOW
Kinect Skyrim is the greatest thing ever
11,01That would be nice GabeMoist, but I'd rather you give it to the people we're helping.
do you take Canadian Tire money?
also, after looking up the plot synopsis, apparently the Main Character of Casshern Sins kills a girl named Luna. Don't think I can watch this show anymore.
11,01They have harder problems than lack of clothing.
Dat Luna
RAWRity: I saw the first episode on netflix, I didnt like it
I don't think he'll be able to buy anything with my money
I have over $300. But US dollars is worth nothing for Nittany_Discord :(
Heading off, bye all
Canadian and such
11,01$300 what?
Canadian_Brony: but your money is worth almost exactly the same amount as ours....
Monies.
I DEMAND THE STREAMERS SING BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY
gimme ur moniez
Canadian_Brony: canadian tire moneys so pointless, and there only in cents
What is this game?
hen3ry all my money can only be used at Canadian Tire
FlootahShy: they have before
I second FlootahShy's Canterlock suggestion
CupcakeWarrior: can't really pass judgement right now. Right now it's definitely got a problem with the art design. It's really, really bizarre seeing a modern day anime with 80's art style.
11,01Ponies47: If you want to *shrug*
/me sadface.
cachi01|GhostRecon: No, I can say FUS RO DUH into my TV
lol
superretroworld I got $50 in Canadian Tire money and was told not to spend it all in one place
FlootahShy: on moonbase lol

Ponies47: same with smile and no fear
Ponies47 to what, The Rant?
Take him to the chamber where the deed will be done!
Only song I can completetly sing perfectly tone and all is Perfect Stallion.
I demand guaranteed, rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!
STREAMERS ARE ****ERS CAUSE DEY NO REPLY TO ME!
Wo is Sumica playing? (requesting civilizations rather than other players)
Canadian_Brony: The Pet Song from May The Best Pet win
Ninjazz: you mean, you cant even sing the mlp theme song?

Om: Let GilDash have her way with you. :D
Suddenly, you are floating through space with only a space suit on, you are extremely hungry, and a five-star meal is floating right next to you. the only way to retrieve it is to take your suit off. What Do?
Gunthler: Not me, this is for Ninjazz.
FlootahShy: wouldnt u die as soon as u take the suit off?
Wait, I wasn't talking about myself there
FlootahShy: Open suit, die, dine in hell.
i am going 2 sleep
Om: o_o
Cant wait till Gods and Kings expansion comes out, Civ 5 as it is now just kinda seems... incomplete. Like its an almost unfinished prodect (but still very enjoyable)

StupidSexyCJ: i was gonna ask if CJ was a reference to GTA :D
Ninjazz: Lucky =/
CrimsonPhoenix: was it u who linked me to a person who make mlp hoodies?

Gunthler: I have principals. Among other things.
panda: Believe it or not, I got some black in my heritage. But I'm mostly white. :$
Saw an LP of Story of the Blanks. I'm not gonna sleep tonight :'(
Well it seems you hate the /me Thing
panda: Silly filly! I'm BLUE! :P
Whats so bad about it?
Om: Just let her have her way with you. :D
Woodenfan: LP??
the voices
I ask because it has come to my attention that I am the only BLACK BRONY!
It's so scary.
I don't hate /me, I hate it when people use it as you are.
Its pretty much the same like regular chat
Western moe has more horsepower. Fluttershy is kawaii DESU DESU DESU! Rainbow Dash is Air Waifu.
I'm red
panda: JaxBlade bor
*bro
cachi01|GhostRecon: Familiar Faces did an LP of it, it's still scary
Gunthler: I'm not sure you understand. So I wont try and explain it more.
panda: there should be another black brony over here
StupidSexyCJ: who dat?
Woodenfan: whats LP?
Om: Your a doofus. :D
cachi01|GhostRecon: where?
panda: look at this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-CkRtPZMZ8
panda you are the only black brony who is currently in the chatroom and is responding to your question
Woodenfan: whos your favourite lper?
Hey panda, Shane337 is black I believe and so is AttackWithHugs
panda: here in the chat
panda: brony youtube star
Gunthler: Indeed. Would not be me without a bit of goofery.
Smacks FlootahShy NO VIDEO LINKS :[
StupidSexyCJ: thank you... I was just feeling alone ^^
Woodenfan: WHAT DOES LP MEAN?
needs more Mount and Blade style fights
Let's Play
LETS PLAY
Hey panda, why feel alone because of the colour of your skin?
OK THX
superretroworld: Clementj642 or Chuggaaconroy. And to cachi: Lp means Let's Play
cachi01|GhostRecon: means lets plays
FlootahShy: thank you... XD
Ninjazz: How about dat gilDash? :D
Woodenfan: come on LP are fun!!
panda: no prob
Gunthler: How bout dat TheRainbowDash? :S
Woodenfan: and story of the blanks isnt that scary
I tried watching NintendoCapriSun, but he has WAY too much toilet humor for my tastes
Woodenfan: kool, my favourites protonjohn
The most awsome thing that will never happen is if the Civ series and the Total War series teams up and creates a super stategy game.
Ninjazz: You got me there. :D
HOW ARE YOU CHANGING THE PINGS
Polydunami: nah i was kidding, i just got made fun of cuz i was the only black guy in the group... like token from south park :D
protonjon is cool
>:|
Oh
yeah
panda: lol
Gunthler: :>
superretroworld: How'd you change the pings?
I don't watch much South Park, tbh
Hugs panda
Polydunami same here
Ninjazz: That's two wins for you today, you are on a roll.
ShiningArmor: remeber AoP
Woodenfan: whats a ping?
I've seen enough to develop a negative opinion
Om: Yippee. ;|
Om who's winning?
:|
And that's all I have to say
so who's stream is this?
superretroworld: You sent me something, I get a ratatat noise. How'd you do that? It's like a notification noise.
Polydunami: I hate South Park too
I dunno
Canadian_Brony: Not you that is for sure.
MahBoi777- I dont know, i like south park, it still manages to be fresh after all this time. Unlike the simpsons and family guy.
Polydunami the only thing I find (remotely) interesting about the show was the Chewbacca reference used in the court
I think this is a kirz stream
I really don't like today's Southpark. When that rumor was going around that they where gonna make a episode about making fun of bronies. I agreed I would stop watching South Park if they did.
Woodenfan: you don it to someone to get there attention, type in there name, not all of it and press tab, you did it to me too
if you want to get*
If they make fun of bronies, we just need to take a joke. We've seen them make fun of EVERYTHING before.
Rex_Mundi: the new Family Guy eps DO suck
Ponies47 if we raged at Fox News, imagine what it would be like for South Park
south park makes fun of everything. If you are offended that they made fun of something you are a part of, then you kinda need a slap to the face
Pff. Fox News is a joke, as far as I know
I HATE FOX NEWS! SAYING WE AHVE DISORDERS! :[
much like Family Guy
I like South Park, sometimes though other people who watch it take it too far
*HAVE
agreed. SP makes fun of everything. Being made fun of by them means only that you're _worth_ being poked at in jest.
fox news the best comedy chanel on tv
^
like the Ginger thing
Ponies47: they attacked us too :(
Ponies47: im just about love and tolerate
Ponies47: What if you do have a dissorder?
I don't
and that whole scientology fad
according to fox news we all file for disability and stsy home all day
Canadian_Brony- Getting fun of by Fox news is almost a badge of honor. FOX is really that bad of a news station, people who dont watch any news know more than those that watch FOX.
Better watch out for those lawyers
This is why I tolerate Aussie TV, it's only sport and crappy news about food killing us
I am starting to think "The Legend of Korra" should be called "The Legend of Lin"
faux news. Pfft.
Ponies47: my life is based upon the brony motto
Faust News would be pretty cool.
^that is a hentai
^^
fauchs knews
well im off to bed, night everypony
Faust news? :s
night superretroworld
gnight superretroworld
have fun superretro
Ponies47, who said what now?
night superretroworld
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: My life anything to do with ze ponies
Goodnight superretroworld :)
Rex_Mundi I was double offended by their attack. Saying we could take them over with a board and nail puts us at a serious low compared to them, let alone the Brony attack
gonna watch some of my torrents. l8r
night superrtroworld, hope you dont end up trapped in a room against your will tonight.
lol Ponies47
bye Woodenfan
DuskStarshimmer: ranting about fox newsa

Fox news?
/me plays Barry White

Ponies47, dont forget, most people dont act logically, espeically when god is involved.
/me is a little bored
Gunthler I think Filly Rainbow Dash is the most adorable thing I have ever seen
Ponies47: pfft fox news all they are a bunch of loud mouthed retarded incested rednecked doopies
eeyup
/me pokes ShiningArmor
So, Polydunami... You're a Celestia fan?
Canadian_Brony: I liek Dashie... a lot... :3
Spike had too much doughnuts
I smell bible bashing

Polydunami: wheres?
DuskStarshimmer: true
Never mind
Gunthler is in it for the plot
lol bble

Kid__Cobalt: But it gives me the felling of being... watched.

StupidSexyCJ: I see ive been spotted. -lol- How are you sir ^-^

I WANT TO BE AN OOMPALOOMPA

Life_Essence: O RLY?

Kid_Cobalt: awesome, and you?
Divide and Conquer
Polydunami: with a mouse
Ninjazz: You in space buuuudie?

kirzstryfe: which country r u?
I CAN DO A REALLY GOOD VOICE OF FLUTTERSHY! (From Shed.mov)
DeathStar: Meh, I've seen better
Yeah using mibbit rather than the stream client
Polydunami actually, I have no clue
i need to make a rainmeter to tell me when BS has a live stream
Life_Essence: :'(
StupidSexyCJ: Sleepy, just came to watch you silly fillys for awhile before I hit the hay.
So who ells here likes ponies? I hear that this "Friendship is Magic" show surprisingly good, and that it has adult male fans?! Can you believe it?
Yay DeathStar :3
I haven't seen BronyinJapan in a while... ?
Kid_Cobalt: hit hay? what did the hay ever do to you?
DeathStar: I know that feel bro :(
Polydunami: ikr
Polydunami: Ahhhh.
Me neither.

this is crazy talk, Rex_Mundi
I smell a Vancouver fellow
Rex_Mundi: what male fans!
Kid_Cobalt: but you all seem to be just sitting there. watching. judging. watching.
dammit, nvmd
StupidSexyCJ: Not quite the expression i was going for sugar cube -lol-
hey guys
Kid_Cobalt: and more Watching.
Rex_Mundi: NO WAI
Polydunami it ain't me. I live farther norht, but still in B.C.
Rex_Mundi, I may be a bearded man, but Im really a 6 year old girl at heart
*north
Now that I'm an Oompaloompa I don't want ot be an Oompaloompa
FlootahShy: But were all your friends. All of us Wub you.But if we all talked we would drown you in the Wub. So we watch in silent appreciation ^-^
/me gasps
A BEARDED MAN?
I BEARDED MAN
derpy_pony- I know right! Real men dont like ponies, they should only like bear... and race cars and other MANLY things.
/me turns Life_Essence into something that is not an oompaloompa using power of dance
I thought they only existed in carnivals
/me plays pirate tunes on mandolin
YOU are a pirate!
/me is now a pony
I know it's not you Canadian_Brony
Life_Essence I'm 14 and I'm growing a beard, mustache, AND sideburns
Rex_Mundi: cant i like both
Kid_Cobalt: But-... I-... Fine.
FlootahShy: :)
Life_Essence slowly, but surely
I think this brony thing is a conspiracy. Consisting of three bored college students. The rest are bots.
Canadian_Brony: I am 21 and can grow a wicked Abraha Lincoln beard and that's it
Canadian_Brony, I have more leghair on one toe than you probably have on your entire eyebrows
a unit got ded
DuskStarshimmer that is . . . ugh
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, Same link
I wonder if that is a good idea?
derpy_pony: you're a conspiracy
Well hang on, let me check this show out *watches show* Sweet holy plot, this show about ponies is the greatest thing in the history of great things! I love Fluttershy!
your mother, Life_Essence
derpy_pony: it all makes sence now
Polydunami I can tell the weather in Vancouver: When you can't see the mountains, it's raining. When you CAN see the mountains, it's going to rain
you must construct additional pylons!
More or less, yeah
pylons pylons pylons
/me warps in additional pylons @ Starlight_Phoenix,
annex everything
DuskStarshimmer: which one lol
what is this "pony" u speak of?

Alicorn_Prince_Shane, I haev to opt for the one tha isn't mostly a shade and is actually a hue
00,10might have to wait a bit longer =p
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Your an alicorn correct? -lol- well only one of them is actually an alicorn. But if I had to pick just on which I think looks better I love the black coat of the alicorn ^-^

Polydunami: there there filly
FlootahShy- actually not me though, I was already a fan of cartoons when i heard about this show, when I saw how big the fanbase was, I assumed that I would like the show at least a little. I expected to like MLP from the begining.
Sumica: oh you
I bet the kids who grow up in the city of Wonderland are really bored, and complain there's nothing to see there.
pffft FlareChaser
/me is adicted to breathing
good
Rex_Mundi: same here
Hey Shamroc I heard you like chickens, and thanks for the shoutout. :|
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, what?
pfft flare ive played a Cod the day it came out for 23 hrs
Polydunami: u sounded angry
FlareChaser: tsk tsk giving octavia no attention. -lol-
Rex_Mundi, I herd this show was about soemthing other that yelling "AAAAA" for 9 epesodes stright, so I assuemd I would like it.
When?
Kid_Cobalt: wha..I mean...jues.z.
What?
FlareChaser: :)
I must have that Caramel vibe where I sound angry but I'm not
question for you ponies, what game would you like to see a Let's Play (or dual let's play) of?
Om: Air is so yesterday
2,14 I'M NOT MAD I'M JUST TALKING VERY LOUD
can be anything from 1990 to today
Ecco the dolphin 2 the tides of Time.
D:
y u mad bro?
MahBoi777: I'm a hypster.
Caramel do you use the Royal Canterlot Voice?
Life_Essence: the adventures of cookie and cream PS2
I didn't say you were actually angry
Dat Valthejean
Om: Hipster*
Caramel: Oh, thats cool. but my ears are now bleeding.
has to be PC sorry
Caramal. POLITE ALLCAPS GUY?
and speak in Middle English?
2,14 WE DO NOT HAVE VERY GOOD COMMAND OF THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE
Caramel: Obviously youve taken to the royal canterlot "WI"
Om: Lol
Ninjazz: Hypster.
Dat Valthejean
Om: Hipster*
Caramel: -lol-
Kid_Cobalt: he stole lunas wii?
Ninjazz: In know what the real word is boy.
Luna not happy wii was stoled.
Kid_Cobalt: to the suuuuuuuun!
Caramel well, what about just saying stuff really loudly and considering it as a whisper?
Shamroc: Can I nom you? :D
DeathStar: -lol-
Anyway, Alicorn_Prince_Shane, when did I sound angry?
WE ARE THE UNICORNS THAT SAY...NI
Spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace!
Ni!
Om: You may know THAT, but you don't know how to spell! :D
he said SPAAAAACCEEE!!!!
spaaaaaaaaaaace!
/me is not a unicorn
Dad, are you space?
As for Ecco 2, if I could find it I could as I do have a Sega Mega Drive
HA!
Ninjazz: I am a hypster. Aka I am better than you!
*I could do it
Shoutout.
FlareChaser:
yes, son. Now we are a family again
Pegasus_Gunthler: yay
MahBoi777: yes now we are a family again
I'm famous now :|
Canadian_Brony- I would really like to hear Celestia speek in the ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE! That would be beyond epic. Especially if she does that glowy eye thingy and is visually angry. Really... Celestia and Luna need an episode all to themselvs, that would rock our socks off. Speaking of witch, I like ponies in socks.
Om: No... That's impossible!
Whoa
/me bursts into flames
/me 11,01pretties kirzstryfe
Sumica: how long is one accel world ep usually
warnings are best shoutouts
Midnight_Tempest: oh you

Shamroc: you're in kirz's house?
Ninjazz: Finishing move! (falls asleep)

Nigh yall!
LOL

Im not much of a fan-fiction fan, nor do I dont like shipping too btw
/me attack nuzzles DuskStarshimmer
So you must be THE knights who say Ni?
Midnight_Tempest: You silly foal and your spontaneous combustion ^-^

Cya Om. Take care, buddy.
*the end is neigh
Shamroc: what if the world was Scootaloo?
Bye Om :)
hello everypony :)
bye Om! stay hipster
Hi midnight *cough* *cough*
DuskStarshimmer: please don't use BS to shorted bronystate because it also means....something else
hi mario_pony
All Civ games are about exploring the world, finding new civilizations, and then genociding them
hey mario_pony!!
bye Om
Hey there mario_pony :)
Kid_Cobalt: shush you or i'll... uh... sick my demon hunter on you... yeah...
Polydunami- yes, I mentioned ponies in socks indeed.

Shamroc: Well, you said kirz is going to destroy the world, the world is scootaloo now.
DeathStar, it means Bronystate and BeljumwaffleS
Oh. Ponies in socks?

Shamroc: wWELL like.. you .. thats. opinion man
DeathStar then I have no idea what you mean
/me breaks up Polydunami s and Ponies47 s fight
Mutterguy: oh you
Midnight_Tempest: ehhh.....not the demon hunters....:(
Did I say something?
RASIE THE CITY
Wait, I'm not fighting
DuskStarshimmer: brbrbrbrbrbr

*RAZE
Polydunami NO!! You didn't!

It's full of awesomeness :)
my feet hurt really bad
/me hugs Alicorn_Prince_Shane
/me cringes at Rex_Mundi's comment
back to the future was a good episode as well because Twilight
/me takes off glove and slaps Polydunami with it

Woodenfan: join the club
Hey all.
Shamroc: do you know what this is? this is a ping and you are going to yell at me if I continue, worth it.
I just got back from Bronies NYC :)
Hello Randomnerd
I know exactly how she feels: I suck at sports, yet I give it my best.
heeheeheee
G1 is so much better than any of the others up till now
Rex_Mundi G1 was the most tolerable out of the past generations . . . sea ponies
LoLZ
Did anyone say hai to you, Twi_Fi, yet?
SHOOBEEDOO
...Alcohol...
G1's pretty dark, don'tcha think Life_Essence?
I had a great time, but god that rave took a lot out of me.

Ew, Firefox.
Sea Ponies won't leave my head.

Canadian_Brony G1 was phantasy with the ponies in actual danger. G2 was a mildy funny (at times) slice of life show. Its G3/G3.5 that is unholy
FlareChaser: lol free trial over

I saw the pilot, and the song won't leave my head.

Phase4 I know, right? Internet Explorer crashes, Chrome is like . . . ugh, and who honestly uses Opera?
Shizuka i found out how to watch the stream on limev site :3
Internet Explorer gave me YT troubles, Firefox gave me scrolling lag that wouldn't leave, and several things didn't work on Chrome after a while.
00,02i use firefox and chrome interchangably, prefer firefox
Phase4: /)

Hello everyone! How is everyone doing today? :D
thanks Tom
00,02ohai MahBoi777
Life_Essence most of the time I was surrounded by idiots, I don't think I'll miss that
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, O_O
StupidSexyCJ- there is a small but growing pony fandom in japan, who knows. MLP might just get an anime version like the powerpuff girls did. The japanese even have their own pony memes. Rainbow dash is nicknammed "Air-Waifu"
Life_Essence: Not everyone does that. I look back on High School as a torture-filled experience I would never repeat again for any amount of money ever. And that's a long way out from it.
o hai Tom
ugh im nearly finished my friday parody
Alicorn_Prince_Shane somewhere around Late September/Early October
Phase4: u taste like peanut butter
hey RainbowRush! doing good, u?
Canadian_Brony: perrrrfect
My brother is still in my room. He's really not watching but he's listening. Idk if this is gonna work :(
Phase4 is feeling too much wub! D:

Argh! MahBoi777, you broke my chat! I'll be right back.

Ponies47: use epic cupcake time
All I'm saying is, my 20 year reunion is this year. I won't be attending that either.
FlareChaser I'll take that as an "All of the above". I suggest watching and episode of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, preferably "Lesson Zero"
The Autoponies wage battle on the evil forces of Discordians
:$
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Older
Ponies47: why not?
Ponies47: how much older?

03brb
Twilight sparkle is best Saga
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I gotta catch him. While he's watching them so I now. I know he's gonna lay low for a while and not tell me auntil I catch him :)
*know
k Ponies47
Odd numbers? as far as i'm concerned so long as I have a knife there is no odd numbers. Judt halves and wholes
spying on your brother totally embodies everything this fandom is about, of course. :D
Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit: Both my brother and I hate the Twilight movies/books
Ponies47: u should go check on him now
Spying your brother is part of growing up for me
Ponies47: That's good.
Sumica: will u be streaming some time in next 3 hrs?
Is it okay if I take off the biohazard suit?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: To early. I only showed him Apple.mov about 10 minutes ago.
00,10doubtfull
I think the air is safe, Twi. I've only seen four or five ponies breathe and simply drop dead for no apparent reason today.
Sumica: sad face so no accel world
Shout are you a brony yet? This might lead to failure but you can be certain of the result :P
00,10it's after midnight here
Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit: no takeing of biohazardsuits!
Sumica: so tomorrow then?
00,10monday? nah perhaps tonight
Don't worry.. im Radiation-proof..
Gah, 3PM can't come soon enough
so u will stream this morning or tonight ur time
Right transitioning to laptop
DeathStar: :(

I am slightly freaked out.
yifle1: That's the whole point of a phone
My suit did nothing!
XD
Guys, just figured out how to post non image links during stream and don't get punished.
You need an upgrade to your suit
I need a magical barrier added to my suit.
00,10what a pitty they went with this anime for the new toonami
wow
Add a ribbon from Final Fantasy to it. Only 9999 GP. And as an added bonus, you can tie it into a smart looking bow
weeeeeee I'm back!
I just realized that I have been humming the Seaponies theme song for five minutes.
Welcome back, Mutterguy
(sigh) He wasen't wathcing ponies :"(
:'(
Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit: the Biohazard suit seemsto have failed you
*watching
03sweet, it works
just give it time
Ponies47: NOOOOOOOOOO
ponies can convert anyone =)
Ponies47: give him time...
Mutterguy: Yes, it has failed me.....
wait, how many cats does he own right now?
except Lead. never heard of ponies convert that yet
Ponies47: :'(
night everypony :D
ponies converted me
i use to dislike ponies
bye panda
Ponies47: Are you sure he didn't switch tabs on you?
but now i iz watch them
Bye panda
:D have a wonderful night guys... and remember... PONIES!
yeah but you aren't a base element.
i don't understand this game...

I showd him Apple.mov He liked. So I hopr I got him. He was watvhing the Angery Video Game Nerd. He did have a second tab but it wasen't youtube :( I think he might of had a second window open and he had headphones on :O
*showed
*hope
03LOL what
*watching
*angry
did he win the game?
Ponies47, just back off and wait
Ponies47: whach for the auto kick there
Dat swaying back and forth on the stream is creepy.
hai everypony :3
02so drf
hi Spell-of-Gaming
Hello Spell-of-Gaming
hai Spell-of-Gaming
That's what I'm doing. Maybe I should let him come to me
02you were able to update it without problems?
What game is this? :P
03yes
02derp
http://imgur.com/a/I7rfE
02nice
game is darwinia
DeathStar: O yeah dat one rule. I was making corrections close one
03the new icons are nice and rainbow colored :P
iiiiiidea. Is possible to have field above the stream that describes what is actually being streamed?
hen3ry: It's possible.
Has backed off and is waiting to see if his brother will come to him.
woo hoo my fanfic got added to FimFiction http://www.fimfiction.net/story/28435/1/Sticky-Bucket-O-Fun/
and tell him he likes ponies :)
but it should be update by mods constantly
hen3ry: it might be a nusince to the streamers though
They used to have a huge banner above the stream to tell when's the next pony episode coming.
HatefulWrath: Adult content? :|
hm
CrimsonPhoenix: LEGASP
CrimsonPhoenix: was the pony discord initally like ...
I may have lied to him a bit about the ponies about the things they do. But we will see
00,10that would require us knowing when the next pony ep is too
http://blogs.adobe.com/brandexperience/2012/05/16/the-cs6-desktop-brand-system/
Ponies47: how so?
13which won't be for months anyway
13so, that was a level of darwinia, but i can already tell no one found the darwinians escorting a soul as touching as i do
True, but even for things like this, some simple interface that would let the mods change one line of dynamic text. "What is streaming now:" $string[50]
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: It has be told that Discord and Celestia had something before, by fans but still
00,10it's been laging the whole way for me
LEGASP 0_o
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: After I showed him Apple.mov I told him that's how they acted :P Besides he wasen't watching when I showed him Lesson Zero. So he doesn't know what the animation looks like :P
(evil laugh)
13output is solid as always here
Shizuka well you made me want to play darwinia =P
real men open their eyes when ponies are on
Sumica: hows ur game going
00,10we stoped
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: He had his eyes open for Apple.Mov But he was looking away during Lesson Zero :(
I would still love to see a flashback with Discord
Ponies47: i was refering to lesson zeo
lesson zero isn't a good first episode. It's only really hilarious when you understand the characters a bit better.
03yeah, it takes as long as usual to open the programs :p
13so, would people be interested in seeing more of darwinia?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I know he sucks he watched the part when Fluttershy killed the bear but that's really it. :P So he's not fully a true man just yet. :|
02well, it's a pretty powerful program derp
'Season 3: coming in September or October we hope!' is not an awe inspiring banner
13at some later time, it's 3am and i need to not miss the l4d2 game tomorrow
03IK know, it's just bloated as frick
03-K
fluttershy wrestling the bear was the best part of the series
Mutterguy: PONIES are Coming
cant wait for season 3
Sumica: iz u going to bed now?
13season 3 is a long ways away people...
well, launch time is alright, compared to some of the other proprietary programs that i use for engineering
you can wait, and you will wait.
Shizuka: sept oct
13it's may... the season won't start until at least september
13there's a lot planned between here and there
when's the game?
HatefulWrath: What the hell have you written?
lol
I thought it up yesterday
i hammered it out in a few hours
I can't wait for Seaon 3. But it will be worth it :)
02It’s light compared to Auto desk maya
HatefulWrath: I'll read it all, just to see what else may surprise me.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: well yeah but I'm saying a banner without the specific details is a kinda lame thing to pin anywhere
Mutterguy: dru tat
Most of the video games announced are coming in Fall, IIRC
03hm
cough call of duty
02or Android SDK
03is there a way to clean out duplicate entries in msconfig?
<_<
>_>
registry hacking
03since it shows two copies of each Adobe thingy from when I had to uninstall
03I disabled them all except for the updater
03but still
/me takes off biohazard suit.
03it's just looking odd
<_< ^_^ >_> v_v
/me hugs Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit so she has to get decontaminated :3
/me nuzzles Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit
03where's it at in the registry? :P
/me licks Twi_Fi
leave the germophobe alone, guise. Jeez.
NOOOOOOOOO
I should have kept it on!
/me rubs his hoof on Twi_Fi
Twi_Fi: why were you wearing that biohazard suit?

04That reminds me, I checked my CPU temp the other night and it was at 78 average
13that i went from 62C to 54C in less than a minute
1378C is bad...
and Sumica cookies or cocktails. iunno what he prefers
04Mhm, I know
13oh wait laptop

If people want something to watch

/me flees
My homepage for Twitter right now is almost full of Shigesato Itoi, and I can't even understand Japanese.
AMAZING feeling for being so simple.
o3o
13Alicorn_Prince_Shane: i'd prefer asuka be idling where she was when i got her, namely 35C >>
It's true how we all changed from before MLP, andd till not at the end of SSeason 2...
04Apparently it's actually normal for AMD Athlon CPUs to run at that temperature or something
It's heartwrenching somehow. D:
VDXRetrotainment: blocked for me....:(

I am now traveling through the weird part of Brony Youtube =/ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JEyJISeM7I&feature=related
04But like I said, that's why I want to wait and clean out my laptop and get a cooling unit for it, plus, I don't want to just leave it on my desk all the time where heat can gather
VDXRetrotainment: No, not Japanese. But living in Japan.
Darkts33: Nah. =3
heh... i found a vial of Liquid Rainbow in Diablo 3...
Midnight_Tempest: whats your char?
Twi_Fi: Oh, shame, I thought that MLP had infested Japan too by now. :D
err battletag?
but what if jeebus never existed?
Midnight_Tempest: don't drink it
Hey, Ghosties. Talking about that thing again?
/me walks
Darkts33: demon hunter
Don't get the wrong ideas, Midnight_Tempest
Midnight_Tempest: DRINK IT
sooo i assume people have heard Shady Vox's Ponyrock anthem?
Heya, Ninjazz .
Midnight_Tempest: i meant Battletag
Hey Malavolent. :)
I need more brony friends =/
And everyone for that matter.
DeathStar: oh that Midnight#1670
(7:58:32 PM) junh1024: how good is the uptake of BD in germany?
(8:00:54 PM) Hale: actually, it's gotten a lot better since player prices have dropped below the somewhat magical 150,-
(8:01:10 PM) Hale: there's hardly any movie you cannot pick up on bd these days
(8:01:16 PM) Hale: HOWEVER:
(8:01:46 PM) Hale: most movies get authored on bd25 here, despite the additional audio track for the german dub
(8:01:57 PM) Hale: i.e. they're ugly as ass
Darkts33: can i be your friend?
and i want to drink it but it wont let me!

00,02oh there we go
Night Ponies47
14some bugs are very silly xD
WTF BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
02I want a PS Vita just so that I can play the portable version of it

14awful
There, thanks
'Byee
02well yeah, but that's the 3DS
fillyfillyy|AFK: ;)
coyboy: phase4 's random stream i think
B-but this is somwhat mezmorizing
02wouldn't be anything like the Vita's version XD
by derpy.... is gone..:(
14I love it :D
Phase4: Can you stream something I just thought of? :D It's about the old music parts in the golden age of musical.
i think i know this song... at least the tune

14although it kinda sucks on a 15'' CRT TV
um
Onyxia : lol
whait isn't this the musical from wall-e?
DeathStar: dunno where but i heard this song too...*wonders*
I got a new chair... My back feels wonderful... =w=
VDXRetrotainment: mabey
02I got the xBox 360 version
Magical_pablez94: wall-e?
hax
What is this movie?
02but I really want the PS3 version, as it has 1080p HD
Phase4: why is there 2 Phase4's
DeathStar: maybe don't remember that well da wall-e themes..:)
00,02two clients
ohh ok
00,02this is xchat, the other one is the website client
Phase is so awesome, he can't be at one place at a time, SIMPLE
Aight.
anyone else recon this is the musical that was in WALL-E?
lol
02but I don't have a PS3 so derp
This is so mezmorzing!! I CAN'T LEAVE!
Huh DeathStar ?
02well, my brother does but
test
never seen Wall-e
oh cmon
sometimes xbox game are better than PS3 game, for development reasons
02I'm not going to buy a game for his ps3 XD
00,10DeathStar got it
VDXRetrotainment: the one that wall-e watches
/me is in a trans
Hey Sumi.
<_< >_>
because they develop for PC, port to xbox (which is similar, platform wise)
i like trains
00,02it was in wall-e
Good one, DeathStar.
DeathStar: OH SH'T You may be right O.o
fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: trance
and then port to PS3 (which is more different to pc/xbox)
yay I'm cleaver
...:|
wat is dis tho
00,10there is no may be about it
I wonder if client eastwood is in this film
maybe
Magical_pablez94: not impressed
fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: :D it may mean something else trans :D
please be in it and shoot to bandits
LOL Magical_pablez94
Which musical is this...? <.<
sorry some bandits
VDXRetrotainment: a musical :D
Magical_pablez94: I FIGURed that out. XD
...rip earphone
VDXRetrotainment: :D:D:D
it has dun goofed
02Like the xBox 360 version of Rayman origins is just a port. The real game is in HD for the PS3
DeathStar: i think u were right, btw :)
00,02Sumica, yeah
00,10that explaines it
00,02well, one of the ways
SCIENCE!
00,02xvfb hates me otherwise i'd use that
How It's Made!
00,02learning time!
correction
ooo This looks interesting... Good one, Phase4.
I always found these shorts interesting to watch and learn from.
omg! i just tuned in, i love this show!
sleeping time for the phoenix...
PartyCannon: yeah!!!
Gnight CrimsonPhoenix! Take care.
CrimsonPhoenix: CYA 2morrow :D
02xBox 360 version of Final Fantasy is just a port too and needs 2 disk
/me listens to fluttershys scream rip headphone :)
Goooodnight everybody
02PS3 one only need one disk and looks a little better
lol
CrimsonPhoenix: 'night
02needs*
Does anyone else like the show Girls Bravo?
I did.
filna fantansy was obviously ported from PS3
14I like PS3, but just because I've never owned a Microsoft console x3
00,02yes, 1000 is low
It's used for home mains
/me thinks that looks tasty
fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: i love johnny bravo :D
14many newgen games look...mm..."souless" to me though
14it's difficult to explain
14I can't feel the fun
Girls Bravo is a etchi anime.
Magical_pablez94: Girls Bravo. Johnny Bravo was good too
02If a game is older and not Final Fantasy, I buy it for the xBox 360. New games I always buy for the PS3
00,02the peak voltage is NOT 240
fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: just joking btw never heard about it...:)
00,10yep we use 110 and 220
00,02its 240 / sqrt(2)
00,02*
02if I'm willing to use my brothers PS3
00,02*derp*
i'm a bit on the fence when it comes to xbox vs ps3, mainly since i haven't used either much
14PS2 vs GC
14:D
wii just sucks, platform-wise , hsan't got the cpu
00,02~340V
02^
Magical_pablez94: It's VERY different. It's an anime show
cool
00,10we also call our unit of mesure standard despight being the only ones that use them
sqrt Phase?
14mini dvd are cute
& gfx
00,02square root
lol
Ah
Phase4: is it me or telstra responsable for this buffer
but i do have a ps3 atm, mainly for ripping SACDs'
00,02its probably telstra
fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: i know... Ninjazz made me figure what does it talk about...:D
02well, if a game is for the xBox 360 or PS3 I never buy it for the wii
00,02i'm watching my own stream without issue
Sumica well, to NEMA they're "standard." :)
That's ONE thick cable...
Your welcome, Magical_pablez94. :)
14I have a Wii and half a PS3
00,02high current
Ninjazz: :D:D
00,02lol dat broke
AOW MY EAR
half, what?
Jelly Beans!
00,02sry bout that, these are broken recordings
dat pun
XD
ima go visit my sister guys cya
also, apparently, the xbox has to use the gpu AND the cpu just to playback HD video
/me is hungwey nao.
It's fine. It's just bleeding ears.
14x3 it's not "mine"
oh
Onyxia: cya
we meet again dat voice
man i love this show
Yay Jellybeans
00,10learn to auto balence
CYa Onyxia. Take care.
thx
02my PS3 isn't mine as well :s
Sumica... Teach how to auto balence.
/me uses magic to heal VDXRetrotainment 's ear
:P
Phase4: are these ur own recordings
Magical_pablez94: I don't think I could explain it without having to type a lot. I dont like typing a lot.
<---- Sumica : I*m a person who wants 100% Control
02I need to buy my own PS3
02XD
00,02[WwqUB]JRP2234, no
Magical_pablez94: SCIENCE!
I'm lazy
fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: lol
VDXRetrotainment: ???
ALL the starch!
14I just made an account there xD
MASS PRODUCTION = The ruin of Mankind..
02I mostly only use the wii for Mario and Zelda titles
Oh my god.
well... sleep time, too much Diablo 3 for one day...
00,02VDXRetrotainment, i disagree
00,10well at least yours only has a moment of buffer between videos Phase4
Phase4: Mass Production = more machines, less humans, more conflicts.
14I mostly used mine for GC games, Metroid, Fire Emblem and Pokémon
less humans = less conflicts imo...
Midnight_Tempest: Is Diablo3 worth me buying?
Less room for hman error
00,02VDXRetrotainment, as oposed to pre mass production, where you needed to fight each other for resources
02I use mine for GC titles as well
More machines = more precision.
Better fight with money, then fight with nothing.
*human
fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: if your a fan of the series, yes... if you like dungeon crawling, hack and slash games... yes..
fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: Ninjazz just said me it's an ecchi anime :)
fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: if your not a fan of either of those, then no... its not
Yes... Yes it is.
02which are mostly Zelda and Mario titles XD
Midnight_Tempest: What if I have not played any of the series but like that kind of game.
So it's made of sugar... and sugar.
don't forget the sugar and the sugar
14x3
Malavolent: exactly
Phase4: It's not all bad though, we evolve and get better Technology from Mass Productions, but we lose out on Humans values...
14I have the first CoD
fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: u should look for diablo1..
And syrup.
14buggy as hell, but fun
fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: then it could still be worth buying, i enjoy the game alot and the idea of friends joining your game is cool
i love learning how the things i love are made
Midnight_Tempest: Cool thanks
are those m&m's?
02never played CoD before
jelly beans
02just never got around to playing them :x
but yeah... sleep time is now...
And rot your teeth!
mmm wax
00,02VDXRetrotainment, i don't belive that tech == loss of human values. all technology is nothing more than a tool, misuse of the tools is what makes us loose values
14play CoD 4 :D I loved it
00,02not the tools themselves
^
Phase4: Can't disagree on that. It's too true. :(
Phase4: i agree
^^
Phase4: iz u be streaming?
/me 00,02has very strong opinions about this
Phase4: Same.
00,02iz be me
Indeed, Phase4.
00,02i've got stuff to do for now
/me 00,02might return to streaming if no one else streams
Phase4: so u stop streaming :(
?
Thanks for the stream Phase4 :)
02hurr
02I'll probably buy it then XD
thx for streaming
00,02one more video
LAWl
LEVAN POLKA!
lol
NOOOOOOOO!
Is this the original? :D
/me spins a leek

00,02VDXRetrotainment, afaik
/me spins aleek
What is this!
The ONE video that started the world meme... HAH!
MEZMORIZING!
I'm okay with this.

Only critical flaw with that game
:D
Notch wants to charge for multiplayer
oh wait no that's the notch game
It looks interesting Phase4 .
/me dances ( DeathStar wanna join? :D)
But...it's too hard for me to read off yet. ><

00,02stack access seems to be implimented via a register read/write
fillyfillyy|trance: too late lol
00,02most architectures use push/pop instructions
00,02its quite interesting
Phase4: i gave my wii a stack overflow
Aaand 1% of us understood that XD

Phase4: Now I must figure out what the hell all of that means! TO THE INTRANATS!

VDXRetrotainment hear hear :)
hello?
DeathStar: what r u doing right now?
Hello DJ
night DeathStar
hi there Dj
00,10Seems Fim is moving back to 7am pst
VDXRetrotainment: This summer I am planning to learn about programming and stuff. I have no idea what that was and I don't know if it even has anything to do with programming.
hi guys
Sumica :(
Hello Df
Hello Dj.
Dj*
Need any simple basics, ask me or Phase. :P
You know about if,else, for, while etc etc?
04Do what?
047 AM PST?
00,10starting next saterday
:P
O.o
00,10it's still just reruns but yeah
VDXRetrotainment: maybe dunnos what is a function neither...
04Ohhhhhh, okay
00,10Aquabats will still be at 8am pst
Magical_pablez94: Functions are scripts, basically, that you can call whenever you need them to do something complicated.
VDXRetrotainment what is your opinion on for-ever loops like for(;;) with an if and a break?
...
Never have a forever loop
:P
sometimes you need them =P. just make sure your condition fires at some point
VDXRetrotainment I can never understand why people tech it
*teach
is anything on now?
For loops are awesome for mathematical solutions
Tassadork why not just a while loop though?
VDXRetrotainment: i know he dunnos..
While loops...oh sh't...
bahdunno!
NEVER use a while loop unless you understand them completely...
I still don't use them
They almost overburnt my computer twice. ><
lol
loops are surprisingly loopy
:)
*squee*
http://www.mycplus.com/tutorials/c-programming-tutorials/loops/ <--- Loops(If else for while)
if i had a theme song this song would be it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KFkP9IvLCk&feature=related
VDXRetrotainment: XD i use activities managment to avoid my computer to overburn :D btw using a for loop is da same..:D
Basically, remember that it's binary. once you get that, Programming is easy, you just ned to know what the computer may and may not do.^^
No
A foor loop has a end.
A for loop can loop as many times as it's operator tells it to
not if you do it wrong... =)
VDXRetrotainment: basically a while should have a end to avoid ur pc to overburn:D
Well yeah.. of course if you do wrong. :P
Magical_pablez94: It does not.
I've personally never had problem with loops.
Most likely it can crash
for (i = 0, i > 0, i++)
A while loop is like hitching a battery - pool with it's battery + pool...
Tassadork: not, but ;
ah yeah
00,02VDXRetrotainment, "NEVER use a while loop unless you understand them completely..." o_O
and also should be >= now that I lok=ok at it
00,02one too many infinite loop bugs?
Aye
I'm trying to avoid them as much as possible
I never got the hang of them. ><
I've never had an issue with while loops
00,02Tassadork, that loop will break
00,02you probably want <
Yep
XD
Phase4: Weren't you busy with something? XD
VDXRetrotainment: never got problems with do/while, while and for loops :D
yeah, I was posting a broken one ...
00,02and something other than 0
00,02ah
Let us noobs try and figure this out XD
chell learned about infinite loops the hard way
lol
if anything while loops are simpler than for loops, there's just the condition, where with fors you have three chunks in specific order
for(thisvariable = 0 thisvariable > 5 thisvariable++(or thisvariable+=1))
that freezed stream :D
Hi, everypony!
pony_2521: hi there
hello P0N-3 :)
Remember that the i is a local too. :P
hi
Like saying...
Do your homework could be like..
hur hur
00,02C99 ads probably the best feature ever, for(int i = 0; i < len; i++) << loop local itterator!
:P
12I'm not here to rant today.
I have no idea what you all are talking about!!!!! *head explodes*
How are y'all doing tonight? It's real early Monday morning, and I'm drunk! I n other words, the usual.
12I'm just bored.
PON-3 wht da hell? i tab failed but was not able to tab him :(
that's right,
00,02P0N-3, reading
for(Homework = 0 Homework > 12 Homework ++) <-- XD
you are here to FLAHS!
00,02talking about programing
/me runs'
Sunday, sunday morning.
monday morning, I hope not
Tab failed what?
oh fuck is a damned 0
same
Phase4- y u declare int in for loop?
12note the lack of |Animation as a suffix in my nick.
Integer.
P0N-3: u trolled me wiht dat fucking 0 in ur name :D
00,02PartyCannon, so i dont have to declare it outside
Oh. :P
00,02and keep track of the
┐(￣ー￣)┌
Hee hee heehee.
'
00,02them;
Phase4: I know that but I don't know anything about programming so I'm lost.
00,02loop local itterators are much better
12so, how's NZ treating you?
┐(￣ー￣)┌
Well fillyfillyy|trance, A good start is to learn the more basic of the values then the loops.
(i actually wrote that on a survey on friday)
Lik what is a int, i, Variable, Boolean etc etc
/me walks
Hooray for cheap booze and easy mares!
VDXRetrotainment: indeed
... Which is what I MIGHT say, if I liked mares...
doesnt mean we cant talk bout loops and ponies eh? the maths wont make our heads explode eh?
But I... I'm P0N-3. Don't judge me!
Well I am going to try and learn some programming stuff this summer.
00,02P0N-3, seems legit
Once you understand how the data formet works, you can build on that to the loops and decisions.
P0N-3: i'm confused
Hooray!:)
Like a boolean = It can either be true or false(And null, but we do NOT want that)
00,02aparentyl i'm marked as away
for(;;){ printf("PONIES");}
00,02why am i marked away
Sooo what do you all think of John doing the Bronycon documentary?
00,02PartyCannon, PONIESPONIESPONIES
Donations have exceeded 80,000 bits!

She's an egghead!
/me giggles.

What was that for?
/me seen dat we r 104 in da chat i say: for(i=0;i<104;i++){printf("bronies\n");}
Memme that's a funny way to say Pinkie Pie!

/me summons 50 waffles "yes they're P0N-3 :D"
/me overflows the stack
Don't worry Ninjazz, Rainbow Dash just reminds me a lil of me. That's why. Except I'm less lazy and more talented.
Fair enough, P0N-3.
It's not my call.
1414/late
