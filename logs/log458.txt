That trailer made the WWE 13-REVOLUTION trailer look great!!!!!!
i watched powerpuff girls
03yeah
i've seen worse though..
i KNOW! they just don't give up.
08,01looks similar to Baldur's Gate
Graphics might be similar, but the aesthetics between D3 and Torchlight are quite different.
WHere have i heard that voice?
3.
Aye, Hense why it "looks" like torchlight
10HAMTARO
Umm, watching wha-oh...
looooooooooooooooool
2?
LOL
10OMG
yes
oh dear
Graphics don't count for much in my book.
12fff yeah hamtaro
10Stop bringing nostalgic thoughts
No
:)
It's Last Standing or something like that.
It looks real.
dat rush hour
11,01Zombies?
i don't want to live on this planet anyomre
Racoon City?
the last of us first trailer was great,didn't know there was another one around
I saw this trailer
1,3nope
the last of us
uh
This is a kind of awesome looking trailer
i am alive?
03I always thought hamtaro was some retarded tamagatch7i thing
looks apocalyptic
Ded.
08,01what's this now?
10Not really
Its The Last ofUs
a trailer Saturn
Saturn: I guess they are just raiders.
The Last of Us
10Twas a cute show
oh..
inb4 hamspetrdance
What's the synopsis?
looks nice
The last of us.
And that's how you park.
just won't cooperate
<3
11,01Ooh. Total Halibut.
if they get the whole survival aspect down
the little girl swears, how cute
What's the plot though?
kill it
1,3Side rooms are now open
Uncharted kart racing? No way Total Halibut....:D
Is it about zombies?
it has them apparently
10Unrelated song and TV show, tho
where did he say that Fluttershy158
Not sure.
he didn't
oh
Ok.
┐('～`；)┌
03well I don't like "cute" shows
Him
Seems like those people that were attacking those two, it might be that its something like a rage vires.
Doug walker
doug said he liked it..
hoo boy
League Of Legends....Veigar is awesome.
when did doug say that Fluttershy158
03not my fault I can't talk to girls easily
/me hides
yep
11,01And still watching my hobby rot.
thank you!
/me steals TheRainbowDash's money
11,01At least on the mainstream end.
11,01I won't buy it.
Not anymore >:3
how do i make pony faces ?
10You talk to me just fine
and i think he said it during a convention
03>online
10inb4 I'm lying about my gender
03LOL
03I was gonna say something mean
03but I won't xD
i warezd A5
10Go ahead
03also frick, are my sitser's friends here already?
10I like mean
03that means I'll be kicked out of the basement
03I like it down here :<
i downloaded CS6MC, but didn't install yet
its not suposed to be taken seriously but he sure knew an awful lot about twilight and RD
(said)
/me runs
03well the reason I ask jun, is because
10Shh, don't tell anyone
035. CLEAN & REPLACE or Copy SSC from package
03in both x86 and x64 common\adobe = c:\program files***\common\adobe\ssc
03There is no ssc folder in x64
03only x86
duno, i'm on 32bit
:D
that too!!
HE HAS JOINED US...
03eh, nvm
Are they talking about hot shots girls?
...
05FINALLY
05hah
(when)
and i didn't clean anything
OK I just walked back in... um... WTF?
Normal?
dat steal XD
03but did you install CS6
05nightmare
Just press play again
03CS5.5 had a different method for warez
onry A5
03because you had to replace DLLs
05mhm
03not that file
05got around 12k health
i replaced a dll in my A5
All thats missing is for AVGN to say he's one
05and armor
05vitality
seems like there are two ways:
035. CLEAN & REPLACE or Copy SSC from package
03in both x86 and x64 common\adobe = c:\program files***\common\adobe\ssc
serial or crack
036. REPLACE "reset files" from package
03to P6 folder (search or look prev posts)
YES!
Magicka
03"C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\OOBE\PDApp\P6"
AC3
04Oh hello Assassin's Creed III
Snooooow!
038. REPLACE "normal activation" from package
03to P6 folder. Upon running encore no further code or activation should appear and the app should start.
assasin creed
03I used a serial...
04Later this year...later this year
I've only played the first AC. :D
And the other part wants to RUN AWAYYYYYYYYYY
lincon is a templar :p
Redcoats!
I'm actually tempted to get AC:III, I played AC and AC: II, but never bothered with all the damn sequals to the second one.
AAAAHHHHHH WAITING IS MAGIC IS HARD
oh...well...nevermind..
05im not nerdgasming...
Running WHILE asasinating!!
05DISSAPOINTMENT
at least we still have Doug Walker
10DOMINO
11,01Not enough people do.
Asassin's Creed 3.
But I like the sims.
yes
Epic Running
Yes!
HOW DO I LIVE without you, I want to know
Dat logo
03o.o
how do i BREATHE without you, if you ever go
/me is playing fusionfall
/me assassin-gasms
This trailer looks promising though.
how do I, how do I, how do i LIVE
and since it's setting is pre-america, it might attract the cod fans
</random>
10Poetry by juhn1024-XD
back
not really
nah, some randome song by Le-anne Rhymes
its called How Do I Live
Colonial America needs more games.
I made a hugeeee mistake when reinstalling Mint 13 ;-;
and it was done by Trisha Yearwood too
in my oppinion AC is a great series
"cussed out"?
11,01Awesome game...ruined by Ubisoft.
04Yes, that thing
it was awful.
ncr ?
AC has good games. It's a bad series, because they're all just rehashes though.
AC is awesome but revelations was just bad
04No no, damn Dari and his streaming
revelatins was too rushed
04Torchlight, yes
Path of Exile beats D3 in every aspect as far as I am concerned
Us Brits still are twats. I'll be the first to admit it. :D
Blame dari!
Bai!
Booooo!
Ummm, youre welcome?
isnt it?
Damnit dari you and you're postion on this earth making it day time there and night time here
I'm not streaming?
Twilight, Applejack, and Rainbow Dash were the only ponies in it..no Pinkie, Fluttershy, or Rarity...
05and henceforth the US
If dari was streaming, he would say "And then everypony came"
although Trisha Yearwood's version was used in the movie Con Air
^
and to make it worse..they were singing pinkie pies songs without pinkie being there
Where is cat?
04No, I know you're not streaming
05you kinda picsk up one or two things
/me hides
05anyways
hmmm bronystates in that eqd post....
10June
Must be a blue moon.
05hope you somewhat enojyed my filler
04But I blame you for making me think Torchwood instead of Torchlight because you used to show that show
