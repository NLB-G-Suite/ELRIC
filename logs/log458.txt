Aye then
i feel kinda sad watching the cat get beat up...
GilDash: keeping us on our toes, I see?
icybeauti: me too, she's my secondary.
Could you consider her as...some kind of furry?
berserker barrage is to mainstream
N4X: she's a catgirl.
Sylandest: Would it be me if I just tried to bulldoze you? ;)
This game looks cool.
of sorts.
Are there instant kills in Blazblue?
WallDives : So...no?
Malavolent: YES.
She has giant arms.
GilDash: ...yeah? xD
GilDash: no, I suppose not. You do have that grace about you, i suppose, lol
you can only do them in the second round, with some requirements, however.
GilDash: Or maybe thats a bit more TheRainbowDash's methods..
Airpuff: You like being bulldozed. ;)

how about a guilty gear vs blazblue game
alexxm: Try mugen.
alexxm: wont happen, Sammy wont let it.
Sylandest: Woot?! Am i that bad?! xD
thats actually why this game exists.
Sylandest: Maybe... ;)
i cant beleave there is a naruto vs dbz vs one piece game...
So are these characters just from the game or do they come from something else?
NewDCD: that looked to me like an usual fighting game boss, broken beyond remedy and unfun to play against
thanks WallDives
Meanwhile: they're all from this game.
Airpuff: lets just say you're a likely accomplice to Gil, lol

GilDash: there.. i ate them all
A fine day to you, Bronystate :)
howdy, Petrified_Discord!
Bronysith: one does not simply post the same pic every 5 minutes.
ROHKARA: this is the JP announcer, actually.

GilDash: now, now, be merciful on the lad, lol
Bronysith: one does not simply pay Jenni 100 points for her to make one for Flare.
/me ... eats the container...
>.<
alexxm: Pretty good. I'm at commencement right now (not graduating, though :))
GilDash: container? sounds....ominous.
Sylandest: He has to learn his lesson. ;)
Bronysith: oh wait, it was simple.
FlareChaser: u paid her 100 points?
Sylandest: T.T
the fun part will be getting winamp's plugins back

Bronysith: Yeah, I was being generous.
Perfect.

Bronysith: guess it wasn't :D nice btw
GilDash: lol, its a fighting game. the story tends to take a backseat
But I can use it on any system, I have the colour buttons I want, and custom art.
Magical_pablez94: ty its Darth Stal(Alexx) the main character from my fanficiton
/me sits down at Sylandest 's side... "Ey.."
since Qanbas are multimodded.
Sylandest: I know. One of my favourite games of all time is Unreal Tournament, which has an escuse plot. :D
/me turns to Airpuff "howdy"

Wow. Another buffering circle
/me is in an awesome mood :D
Sylandest: *Liarface* Nooope
Airpuff: XD
D:
Is this a fighting game too or just a VN?
Sylandest: It doesn't even have any copy protection. Or require a disk. We put it on all the school computers one day. Never got any work done ever again. :D

Kandarihu: fighting game.

Sylandest: I know, right? :D
Airpuff: I think I'm going to keep hold of it for now though. ;)
GilDash: hehe. Back when I was in school, we would sit in class and I would just daydream after getting the notes down
Sylandest: Sounds like me. Probably why I just keep coming up with plot ideas. :D
Sylandest: Sounds like what I do in college :D
this story mode...is very silly, lol
GilDash: /)
CHEESE! FOR EVERYONE!!
09,01Story Mode is mostly serious

Petrified_Discord: lol, close to it, prolly
09,01this is Noel's gag reel
09,01they are HILAROUS
wait scratch that, cheese for no one
It would be funny, if there was Jam in the Chinese restaurant.
GilDash: I have a plot idea I'm working with at the moment. I have it mostly developed, just need to write it out
Malavolent: I wouldnt be shocked.

How can it be horrible if WE CAN'T SEE IT?
Michael: Yokupony: Do what you want because you're free
Dark92Enigma: thats part of the joke..
GilDash: if there is one thing I've learned, it is the fact that there is no such thing as a wasted idea or thought in writing
sudden lag bursts
where's the ron?
Sylandest: So am I. I just need to actually *write* them. :D
rofl, fake it convincingly
I just came back in time to see this. I notice it's stuttering every so often.

14third
NewDCD: There's a reason this game is called "The poor man scene" Alot of yonger people and those with effort put into the game to reach meta games are mostly people of poverty, mostly students and younger. But once you reach the meta game in this, IT IS GLORIOUS!
Airpuff: I still have the container. :)
14why did I click on that image X_X
[21:48] <Viri> second
[21:48] <Viri> why would you burn it

It's been pretty good, alexxm. How about you!?
TheRainbowDash: Oh they have it....This game is a medium hit in Japan.

NewDCD: It's very VERY good for being a translate, compared to Extend, They rushed the deadline and released it worlwide within the same week outside of Japan, and it...caused some Voicework to get rushed. AAaand different voices....Well, it's probably going to get patched, hopefully.

:P
/me is so happy
GilDash, I'm not even sure do I have actual insurance at all, but at least the oven should have a guarantee
LOL my chat derped :3

PONY: And it's a cover for the oven only, no additional damage. It could burn your house down, but you'd only get money for the oven.
WindWhistler: yes, its a fighting game, but we're looking at the joke endings.

That was awesome

Peoplemostly want to see the flashy stuff of Blazblue, WELL here you go! XD
kirzstryfe: im installing it now, we can after its done
kirzstryfe, you guys getting a game lobby together?

Well kids, brb.

panda: Entertain me! T.T
Magical_pablez94, I was just explaining GilDash that I blew up the kitchen, and I was curious would he know anything about insurance things, and then it came to a part where I suspected my landlord doesn't actually even have one.
05msut I wait for sumica to get home to play with someone? TT~TT

05avatar_brolin tread carefully
sweet, got my internet working again, I luv tech support, I need to send those lovely bastards a sexgram
Om: Neither do you. :p
There's currently not a good way to get a list of RP channels other than to look at /list output or ask around.
alexxm dealing with lag may have to unplug again :|
SECRET IS A SECRET SHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHS
GilDash: I'm over it.
The stream window is too high, NewDCD =<
/me non-aggresively tosses a football gently towards wrek*

GilDash: How obsequious.
alexxm its been great, i got 3rd place in the 6th grade spelling bee, and i made it farther than anyone in my class and made it farther than any boy in the 6th grade
I have heard some good stuff about Blazeblue, like excellent animation etc. I even have a song from the game called "Awakening the Chaos", which i really like
i just ate shrimp i feel good
GilDash bring me your finest wenches
09,01Condemnation Wings is an amazing song

alexxm: Look in a mirror.
Om: It's too late in the day to google things...
sounds delicious
it was awesome
what Om
Totally a #secret club goin on
Lil_B: You want good songs? Shinsou, Condemnation Wings, Hekira... and many many more. :D
We do have an RPGServ that should be able to list RP channels (/msg rpgserv help), but nobody is using it right now. I'm thinking we may push for channels to opt in since this does come up sometimes.
whoa
NewDCD so far i couldn't find a full soundtrack, there arwe 5 different versionf of the Soundtrack listed on VGMdb, each with a different number of songs
OP MODE ACTIVATE

hey MoopTheFlyingSquirel what have you been up to

alexxm: organic lab practice. I did not label the flasks I used and didnt know what was in them, so I smelled them instead.
Ninjazz: ... Right. I want you to promise me that you'll go to bed at 23:00 and try and sleep until 08:00 the next day. I don't care if you can't get to sleep, you stay in that bed and you try. Okay? :(
Tf2
*moop*
i dunno if u like 3rd person shooters Wrek but if u feel like giving them a shot u should try Max Payne 3 its glorious
/me hugs mooptheflyingsquirel "cookie?" *(m.?/
Is it supposed to be a good movie? Im contemplating whether I should stay, or go play diablo 3 and miss out on my first movie night.
so much fore
GilDash: 11pm, right? Well... I'll try. :S
*fire
lol keyboard spAZ
i looove this site
However, I don't WANT to miss out on my first movie night, but this is probably the only chance im gonna get to play diablo 3 in a long while

Alicorn_Prince_Shane something about it being too vulgar
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: porn probably
Dken2021: ok lol
Ninjazz: Please try and stay up until then even if it kills you. Then try and sleep until 08:00 the following day, again, even if it kills you. This might take several days but you *will* fall back into a good sleep habit.
/me ok guys i'm bored and tired and cannot watch stream due to my computer lag.... so i 'll go to bed...:D

Ninjazz: no.. im most likely staying up till 6 am anyways xD
Hi all and laters. :)
GilDash: You do? Really?

Nittany_Discord: hour*
11,01Overall.

why was hse topless?
Airpuff: This will attract all males to buy this game.
She is obviously there because she knows what she's on about, and not for sex appeal. :D

Can we hear that line again?
Ass + guns = Nice.
pony_6057, disclaimer: this is not the most sane part of the Fandom, in fact, I'm not even sure does everypony understand sanity as a concept.
I 3 hit this boss with chakram
Listen, I love big juicy asses.
also, has anyone had to deal with those asssholes on xbox live?
which ones
I'm atleast half insane! :)
derpy_pony : I'm a redneck and I think she's uuuuugly. Here, have a Bud.
Nittany_Discord: I really hate gaming marketing now, I mean, it is still good, but it is getting repetitive with the new games coming out, even with of such sequels to series and new series.
Sanity? what is this madness you speak of?
lols
when does the movie start?
Tear dat ass!
What....:D
someone is butthurt

Ohai
Because monies make the world go round
Evening

haha, fleta...no bud, I'm german, I prefer real beer
RyunosukeKnT: Exactly, too butthurt.:D
Fluttershyfan158: have u played Max Payne 3
japanese marketing is weirder and sexist sometimes
TheRainbowDash: Even considering that most games nowadays are re-hashes of a previous title and still sold at FULL price.
11,01TheRainbowDash: I just hate the business practices that are common with major titles now.
hey Golakka hows your day been
counter is broken

Watching that has given me an undying urge that I am currently resisting to snap the copy of Future Soldier siting 4 inches to my right
hey kids! im back! let the pings come!
lali-ho Golakka
Nittany_Discord: You mean profit at the expense of *everything* else?
hey FlareChaser
Flare, lol nope

By the name.. what was the name of that commercial? xD
No ping for you since you demand
Not gonna buy it

1,3|Discord|, do not advertise other channels here
Why are they not playing necromancers :s
I found this boss an absolute bastard on Inferno
kirzstryfe: ......Octavia
Nittany_Discord: Ah, that is what I was trying to go for, about big gaming corpertaions. And even of such that doesn't release games, such as IGN and G4, they are getting a little bias and mainstream also with these of big releases.
11,01Profit and IP control.
That is not a channel
kirzstryfe: wrong ping
not really Fluttershyfan158 because im either in my own party, or I just mute those people
Ass and tittehs~ Ass ass and tittehs~ is my new catchphrase
Fluttershyfan158: i had to deal with those guys,but on pc
kirzstryfe: do you know what that commercial was named? xD

Halo is fun as hell, yeah its a FPS, but the gameplay is different.
/me is trolling in a video
Sumica: areu gonna stream it like sunday early morning?
Hello SmileDashie! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0763500/ b movie. looks better than the a one
TF2 is best FPS though.

I saw that too.
Oh god, Call of Duty internet fight..(sighs):|
I took a freighter full of livestock and exotic dancers into auga :p
TF2 > CoD/Halo in my opinion.

Skunkurn have you visited a Medic yet?

What is this? :|

08,01OmegaMetroidBrony: i have not

Coming soon, for the PS2!

I didn't even know there where other MIB games :(
Doctor Who?

Hello then sammiver!
Oh hi sammiver
TheRainbowDash Oh...sorry i was confused.....
Looks like a wii game?

Hello.
Hello reincarnated sammiver
Aloo sammiver

03iTunes has 5 apparently
evening Obsidian
TheRainbowDash: u seen my oc?
hey Obsidian hows your day been
03I haven't seen the show in order, I just remember watching it when I was little
11,01With Activision, this is a game with probably made with little effort.
hi Obsidian :)
Are we gonna watch a movie?
Hello Obsidian.
question!!!
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: No, not yet.
10hm
Strange, this doesn't look like Footloose, yet my counter says movie night began 35 minutes ago. :P
11,01And priced at $60.
I need a footstool.... where's my mobile school locker...
has anyone ever seen or read the hunger games?
Whos talking?
I looked cheap
in a half hour Nabronyan
Nope Fluttershyfan158
Where are they streaming? D:!
it looks more like a ps2 game
^
I read it but i have not seen the movie :(
10Not seeing other seasons
More like a ps1 game.
10lol Johnny Bravo
i love the hunger games..what if there was a game?
. . . It's Diablo 3, how could you not know this?
08,01what game is this?
Hi everypony! I'm back! Where's the movie?
but like i asked......is my little dashie cruel like cupcakes or something?
RosePetal : which one the firts,the second or the new ?
Oh hai Biglaw

This looks a lot like torchlight, Just sayin
Hey Biglaw.
The first one.

Doctor Whooves: I am the Doctor (Owlicious: Who?) Dr: Just the doctor.
Biglaw: That is my question...
hmmmmmmmmmm
11,01Dunno. You can't knock franchises.
10Samurai Jack, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Power Puff, back when CN was cool
sammicer most certainly not! MLD is a sad story, not cruel
shadow spinarak you're mine
No Golakka, Torchlight looks like Diablo.
08,01oh hey Golakka
sammiver most certainly not! MLD is a sad story, not cruel
11,01If you judged MLP for being a franchise cash-out...
I think the timer is off by an hour
No, Torchlight looks radically different to D2
sammiver: It's probably the completel opposite.
Soooo
Torchlight is more Diablo-like than D3.
What do I do? http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/3724/downzd.png
D3 looks ALLOT like torchlight
03LOL POWERPUFF GIRLS
03and I actually never watched those other two
hunger games video game...there is 1 thing that could save it...GIVE IT TO NAUGHTY DOG!!
08,01but yeah, seriously, what game is this?
What Ersatz said
Derp
NOTE TO MYSELF STAY AAY FROM TTHE PROJECTS SECTION IN LUNA GAME DOT NET
Diablo 3 andrew
Man.....that was a POINTLESS trailer for an MIB game!
10I watched Powerpuff the most
I heard that the directors who did Epic movie are doing another movie based on the hunger games! :O :(
03because I didn't know what CN was for the most part LOL, I just remember watching Dexter at friend's class
03well duh, you're a girl
10Samurai Jack, a few times
nononononononon
08,01Golakka: i thought that hadn't been released yet?
RosPetal NOOOOO!!!!
RosePetal : NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

i hate epic movie!!!
Nope, Released a week or 2 ago
10also, old Scooby Doo FTW

The Tired Games
RosePetal: =_9\

Get you ear to the ground andrew :p
TheRainbowDash: i kno what u did last night
That trailer made the WWE 13-REVOLUTION trailer look great!!!!!!
i watched powerpuff girls
03yeah
i've seen worse though..
Hmm Alicorn_Prince_Shane?
i KNOW! they just don't give up.
08,01looks similar to Baldur's Gate
Graphics might be similar, but the aesthetics between D3 and Torchlight are quite different.
how many mlp seasons are they?
becausei was usually bored on weekend morningd
WHere have i heard that voice?
3.
TheRainbowDash: u were watching
Obsidian 2
TheRainbowDash: MOOOVIES
Aye, Hense why it "looks" like torchlight
10HAMTARO
Umm, watching wha-oh...

GilDash: Hey gil

WAs it a muppet bursting out of a chest?
10OMG
Well, I made popcorn for a movie, sooo, Diablo 3: The Movie
yes
i heard that micheal bay is changing the new TMNT movie..He's making the turtles aliens instead of mutants
oh dear
Graphics don't count for much in my book.
12fff yeah hamtaro
10Stop bringing nostalgic thoughts
Heavy Rain 2?
Just saying, Im looking forward to torchlight 2 more than i was D3
No
pikorar: Hay Piko :)
Fluttershyfan158 eeyup
Heavy rain ?
Yes, this game, I am waiting for so long now.
:)
It's Last Standing or something like that.
It looks real.
dat rush hour
11,01Zombies?
sergio_scriptor: "The Last of Us" by Naughty Dog, the same company that made the Unchated series.
i don't want to live on this planet anyomre
Racoon City?
the last of us first trailer was great,didn't know there was another one around
Nittany_Discord: Eeyup, zombies.
I saw this trailer
1,3nope
the last of us
Nittany_Discord: Hey Nittany
11,01I have a feel that this is a zombie game.
uh
TheRainbowDash: And Crash Bandicoot.
Is it a better zombie game than dead island.
This is a kind of awesome looking trailer
Nittany_Discord : zzzzzombie ponies !!!!
i am alive?
03I always thought hamtaro was some retarded tamagatch7i thing
GilDash: Yeah, i wub that series so much!
what is this i am seeing?
08,01oh, uh, changed game, i guess?
Ded.
Crash Bandicoot is best Naughty Dog game
08,01what's this now?
11,01Hey SpiitFiire
10Not really
SpiitFiire: Holla! ;)
Its The Last ofUs
Looks like shit hit the fan.
another zombie game
The Last of Us
Why drive the loud, rickety pickup truck? Just saying, there are better choices.
10Twas a cute show
oh..
inb4 hamspetrdance
05looks liek a good game
taking a break from dolphin
What's the synopsis?
looks nice
The last of us.
And that's how you park.
just won't cooperate
NAUGHTY DOG!!!
Nittany_Discord: GilDash Im gonna go out with my family, so let me know what i miss :)
<3
11,01Ooh. Total Halibut.
if they get the whole survival aspect down
the little girl swears, how cute
What's the plot though?
kill it
AND Crash Bandicoot
Nittany_Discord: you never say hi to me :|
1,3Side rooms are now open
Uncharted kart racing? No way Total Halibut....:D
11,01This is a Sony-only game? Online passes ahoy!
Naughty Dog made crash bandicoot! This game is gonna be awesome
this game looks good
/me 11,01hugs FlareChaser
Is it about zombies?
GilDash: See ya in a bit :D
11,01Sorry. Didn't see your message.
/me forces juhn1024-XD to dance to hamsterdance jingle.
SpiitFiire: Aye. :)
it has them apparently
/me hugs Nittany_Discord back
isn't doug walker a brony?
Fluttershyfan158 I'm not sure if he is
10Unrelated song and TV show, tho
Made by the same people who brought Uncharted <3
where did he say that Fluttershy158
Not sure.
he didn't
I know Cinema snob's wife likes mlp.
Fluttershyfan158: he said he liked the show and though it was funny,but that he did not like itt brony level
10Now I know what writer's block feels like
oh
Ninjazz: I wub that series so much, much deserving and granting of awards and stuff, and it already has. However, I think that Uncharted 3 should've won Game of the Year for 2011.
Ninjazz: Was that game they're talking about called something else earlier in development? 'Cause it reminds me of something else that hasn't been released yet.
Ok.
who did scriptor??
┐('～`；)┌
03well I don't like "cute" shows
Him
11,01I'd be interested in this game, but I know an online pass is coming, so interest is dead.
TheRainbowDash: INDEED!
GilDash: Did it have something to do with a some kind of poison gas?
10You need more cute in your life then
Seems like those people that were attacking those two, it might be that its something like a rage vires.
GilDash: On the surface I meant.
who liked it AJ or Doug Walker?
Nittany_Discord: Doesn't it suck, sticking to principals? :D
Ninjazz: Ah, quite..(sips cider on my 1 million dollar leather chair, in my private estate, with my suit and what not):D
Doug walker
doug said he liked it..
It has to do with a mushroom that can take over your mind
Sumica: You there?
hoo boy
TheRainbowDash: WHEN DID YOU BECOME MillionareDash?! :D
So when do we get some bronystate stuff instead of stock footage?
Fluttershyfan158 CR's a brony in case you didn't know
League Of Legends....Veigar is awesome.
Fluttershyfan, where'd he say that? I'm looking for it
Ninjazz: Ahh, they just mentioned "I Am Alive" which is what I thought it might be, so no worries.
Ninjazz: Ummm....a while ago....:D
when did doug say that Fluttershy158
HE SAID IT IN AN ASK THAT GUY EPISODE
03not my fault I can't talk to girls easily
/me hides
11,01GilDash: Not really. Just sucks to know the bullshit that the game will come with.
yep
GilDash: Ahhh, yeah. Very similar games in concept.
11,01And still watching my hobby rot.
thank you!
/me steals TheRainbowDash's money
Nittany_Discord: Well, I try not to support these things on principle. :D
11,01At least on the mainstream end.
Got mah Bronystate laptop on mah lap and some Metroid Prime in the Wii... I think tonight's gonna be a good night
a question showed up involving twilight or RD..
Fluttershyfan158 take note, ask that guy isn't suppose to be serious
11,01I won't buy it.
Not anymore >:3
how do i make pony faces ?
I should get Diablo III, but I am not interested in that type of game at all....hmm.
Is it just me, or does this boss look like Nocturne?
00,10What's up Kid_Cobalt?
Now, if Bill Gates were a brony, we'd control the world!
10You talk to me just fine
and i think he said it during a convention
/me 11,01dusts GilDash
in the asked that guy episode thought about who was the bst pony: anwser twilight is the best pony :)
Ninjazz: I really don't keep up with gaming anymore. When I start saving up for my new PC however... :D
No TheRainbowDash why waste money on something you're not interested in?
Hello guise, I just joined, and what the HELL? Is that TotalBiscuit?
Ninjazz: No! Why you steral my 5 million money?
03>online
/me 11,01dusts Sumica
Nittany_Discord: *Achooo!*

10inb4 I'm lying about my gender
03LOL
03I was gonna say something mean

10Go ahead
03also frick, are my sitser's friends here already?
10I like mean
Sumica: one sec. Ill PM you.
03that means I'll be kicked out of the basement
03I like it down here :<
OmegaMetroidBrony: Yeah, it was sid of "Perfect game and that anypony will like it", but I shouldn't buy it still.
i downloaded CS6MC, but didn't install yet
its not suposed to be taken seriously but he sure knew an awful lot about twilight and RD
(said)
03also LOL, that totally sounds like BDSM, just saying
/me runs
03well the reason I ask jun, is because
10Shh, don't tell anyone
035. CLEAN & REPLACE or Copy SSC from package
03in both x86 and x64 common\adobe = c:\program files***\common\adobe\ssc
GilDash: Yeah well, I don't blame you. If you got a bad PC, you're pretty much screwed over. If you do have a pretty good PC, you're still screwed over. And then consoles... Still pretty much the same. :D
03There is no ssc folder in x64
03only x86
03so I'm not sure what they want me to do
I liked FF13 ^^
duno, i'm on 32bit
TheRainbowDash: You don't deserve that much money. >:3
:D
Why would you be screwed with a good PC?
Ninjazz: Good PC you're only screwed by money, but that hopefully won't be a concern to me. :D
that too!!
Ninjazz: I got it from person in box. Give me 5 million money, or make me video.
That awkward moment when Final Fantasy hits 30 games.
HE HAS JOINED US...
03eh, nvm
Are they talking about hot shots girls?
Ninjazz please if you're in the business I'm in you have more monies than TRD
should i tell my friends that i am a brony?
SOON THE OTHERS WILL
...
05FINALLY
It's dead!!
Damn you chat
05hah
Biglaw: "Final Fantasy XXX:......Whgen will this fucking end??!?"
GilDash: What about those blood thirsty vampires that go by the name of Game Publishers.
(when)
and i didn't clean anything
OK I just walked back in... um... WTF?
What difficulty is this, Wrek?
Normal?
dat steal XD
sammiver no need to if you want
03but did you install CS6
05nightmare
Ninjazz: Hey, I can avoid the bad games still. :D
TheRainbowDash :| Final Fantasy XXX
Just press play again
Flettershyfan159:the masters of the internet are joining us, soon the entire internet and wold will folow MUAHAHAHA
TheRainbowDash: First you gotta threaten my family. >:3
03CS5.5 had a different method for warez
Ah. You're pretty tanky then.
onry A5
03because you had to replace DLLs
05mhm
03not that file
Biglaw: For 30, you kno-oh, snap...:D
Biglaw lol
OmegaMetroidBrony: Care to make some investments?
05got around 12k health
i replaced a dll in my A5
Ninjazz: 'Sides, there's more indie developers on the PC I can support. :)
05focus in life steal
All thats missing is for AVGN to say he's one
Lol nope My business is illegal
05and armor
05vitality
That's pretty impressive for nightmare.
(threatens Ninjazz's family) Make me video, or give me my money.
what business is that OmegaMetroidBrony
seems like there are two ways:
GilDash: True... But what Indie game needs a good computer? :S
034. DISABLE any adobe services - make sure you do this, it's an important part of my solution
03AAM \ ADM services = adobe app\download manager
03Mostly this little guy who pops after offline registration: C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\OOBE\PDApp\P6\AAM Registration Notifier.exe. You can rename its extension to ***.BAK.
03And: search your processes for anything with adobe in path. (task manager...)
035. CLEAN & REPLACE or Copy SSC from package
03in both x86 and x64 common\adobe = c:\program files***\common\adobe\ssc
serial or crack
036. REPLACE "reset files" from package
03to P6 folder (search or look prev posts)
YES!
Magicka
The kind of business that gets you're runners killed
03"C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\OOBE\PDApp\P6"
037. RUN En and ACTIVATE
03Run Encore (optional about 8 times) each time using a different serial (prev posts). Activate offline/"trouble with internet" by copying and pasting request code to response code.
AC3
04Oh hello Assassin's Creed III
03Updated note: It should repeatetly ask you for new serials as if you didn't activate.
Ninjazz: Some of them are actually really good.
Snooooow!
038. REPLACE "normal activation" from package
03to P6 folder. Upon running encore no further code or activation should appear and the app should start.
assasin creed
Fluttershyfan158:he already said,what he thought about mlp : "i dont care for itt" his words
Hmmm? What is this?
03that's what it says
03I used a serial...
TheRainbowDash: D: FINE! Take 1 million monies.
04Later this year...later this year
I've only played the first AC. :D
11,01Ubisoft game. I won't even start.
And the other part wants to RUN AWAYYYYYYYYYY
Ghosties: dat Ghosties :D
lincon is a templar :p
Redcoats!
/me 11,01dusts Ghosties
04This game cannot come out fast enough
TheRainbowDash only the most nerdgasmic trailer ever
Ninjazz: You still took 4 million of my money, and I want back.
I'm actually tempted to get AC:III, I played AC and AC: II, but never bothered with all the damn sequals to the second one.
AAAAHHHHHH WAITING IS MAGIC IS HARD
oh...well...nevermind..
05im not nerdgasming...
Nittany_Discord: yes, save us the disapointment :( we already know the shit stain that is ubisoft :|
Bear!
Running WHILE asasinating!!
Biglaw: I've seen more nerdgasmic trailers than this.
05DISSAPOINTMENT
TheRainbowDash: Mmmmmm... No. >:3
at least we still have Doug Walker
OMG IS THIS BATMAN??
10DOMINO
11,01Not enough people do.
dead island trailer gave me the hardest nerdgasm i ever had
Ubisoft can die, EA can die, Activision can die...
Asassin's Creed 3.
CHARGE YOUR DRUMS INTO THE BATTLE- criken reference :)
^ Ghosties
Ninjazz: Then you shall die for stealing my money, and so of your family.
But I like the sims.
has anyone ever heard of ponypokey?
yes
Epic Running
/me 11,01gives GilDash a dollar.
Yes!
going into smaller building?! what is this madness!
HOW DO I LIVE without you, I want to know
<--- They've used a common sound effect at least 3 times in that trailer. :|
Dat logo
03o.o
TheRainbowDash: Ehhh. I'm already depressed like hell. Can't much better than this right now. :)
Nittany_Discord: well... still dont say it :( I'm still trying to get over it
how do i BREATHE without you, if you ever go
they kick ass
Nittany_Discord: That'll be no help at all. I'm in England. :D
/me is playing fusionfall
/me assassin-gasms
This trailer looks promising though.
how do i EVER, happen so fast
Oh Metroid Prime how I love playing ping pong with your doors <3
Nittany_Discord: Thanks anyway. :)
Ninjazz: Wait, really?
how do I, how do I, how do i LIVE
11,01Blow your nose with it.

10Poetry by juhn1024-XD
honestly i like the look of this game
back
not really
I am still not sold on this game.
hey hey panda
anyways
dead island trailer = super duper mega hyper nerdgasm
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: :D hiya
its called How Do I Live
I made a hugeeee mistake when reinstalling Mint 13 ;-;
04I think you'd be better off getting Torchwood and Torchwood 2
and it was done by Trisha Yearwood too
in my oppinion AC is a great series
i went on a trip to canada once and went to alberta..there was a fair..and then i saw an MLP FIM live...
in late 1997
TheRainbowDash: Yeah... I don't want to put the tag on though cause I (even though I appreciate the concer) don't want to type to everypony I meet asking me whats wrong. :D
"cussed out"?
oh god why
This guy's jimmies are rustled by the time period as well
Your opinion is objectively wrong, cachi.
11,01Awesome game...ruined by Ubisoft.
You mean Torchlight Ghosties ?
04Yes, that thing
wait, a torchwood game? ans in Dr. Who spin-off torchwood?
Ninjazz: Oh, right...I'll get started then...(kills you) There you go.:D
it was awful.
Nittany_Discord hardly
ncr ?
AC has good games. It's a bad series, because they're all just rehashes though.
The bear is a Browncoat!!
AC is awesome but revelations was just bad
thats totally not a biased opinion Nittany_Discord
04No no, damn Dari and his streaming
that bear is NCR ! kill him
revelatins was too rushed
XD The bear is a browncoat!
11,01AC2 PC was ruined by the worst DRM in existence.
cowvarkian: not bias if its true :|
04Torchlight, yes
Path of Exile beats D3 in every aspect as far as I am concerned
Ghosties, wut
Us Brits still are twats. I'll be the first to admit it. :D
TheRainbowDash: Thanks you... t^t
Blame dari!
ive now been reading my little dashie for 15 minutes and it is very interesting
Bai!
Booooo!
Ummm, youre welcome?
his life sux
Nittany_Discord: no Wrek
Nittany_Discord: I think it is DCD.
isnt it?
05actualyl the enigma decoding was done by a swedish mathematichian
Damnit dari you and you're postion on this earth making it day time there and night time here
I'm not streaming?
Twilight, Applejack, and Rainbow Dash were the only ponies in it..no Pinkie, Fluttershy, or Rarity...
/me f2k kyu - Prayer's Score (2chFLAC@919kbps, 34.17mb/5:11)
11,01Dari hasn't streamed in forever.
Wrek....ahh nationalism...its funny
05but to stay neutral we "gave" info to the brits
05and henceforth the US
Ezio has 110% Swagger
If dari was streaming, he would say "And then everypony came"
although Trisha Yearwood's version was used in the movie Con Air
^
Ezio is best pony
and to make it worse..they were singing pinkie pies songs without pinkie being there
GabeMoist: Ah, exacly.:D
11,01This is Wrek.
This is dog.
Where is cat?
05my dad is a ww2 history freak
04No, I know you're not streaming
Hello Dog. This is Catfort
05you kinda picsk up one or two things
/me Glomps Beta_Carotene
Skylands, protip: It's Jun
so RD, Twilight, and Applejack were singing giggle at the ghostly...

connor is 20% cooler than ezio
Holy crap, we got a post on EQD before the stream finished and before it started.

Must be a blue moon.
05hope you somewhat enojyed my filler
04But I blame you for making me think Torchwood instead of Torchlight because you used to show that show
10Why do you have an H in your nick then?
Jun-Hong is my first name

03Updated note: It should repeatetly ask you for new serials as if you didn't activate.
038. REPLACE "normal activation" from package
03to P6 folder. Upon running encore no further code or activation should appear and the app should start.
03I did that
So let's see, we've found Braeburn, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie... who else will we find?
SunderlandPony89: another one. Duct taping a pair of snowboards to the top of a car, having two people stand on them, sword fighting with plastic lightsabers, on the free way, while another person stands on top of another car, attached only with a pair of bunjee cords from the dollar store, video taping it.
