Wrek: then why are you acting like a insufferable jackass all of a sudden?
Wrek... sober? The. Worst. Possible. Thing!
^
Quit picking on Wrek.
10Midnight Tempest fare thee well. I wish you the best of luck with your everything-killing

Meanwhile: no one is picking on Wrek, atm he's picking on Silver_Streak.
05becasue you are goign on my nerves constantly backseat modding, and constatnly watchign every step to criticize my ways
I just got these ash stains out of mah cxarpet
05if you dont like it, then too bad.
/me is pondering something...but not sure what the something is pondering...
:(
Wrek: what ways? your kicking people for no reasons other then the hell of it.
10DeadpoolDash, words, eh?
DeadpoolDash: nothing an 80s montage won't solve
I wouldn't call it picking on so much as poiting out the obvious.
pointing*
just because i'm a furry or a girl or something... i didn't even do anything to you why pick on me?
10^That's not exactly fair, come on now
05i dont give 2 cents about your sexial preference
05uaÃ¤*
05ual*
Meanwhile: so help me, I will FIND something that will make you have an EMOTIONAL RESPONSE.
/me looks around
10From my perspective it was a bit of fun, don't take anything personal into this.
yo rainbow dash watchya reading words words words (insert hamlet crazy face)
Silver_Streak, you is furry?
otakon: You may try, but you will fail.
I didn't say anything about preference....
Silver_Streak: he doesn't, he's pretty damn open minded.
Yes she it
/me feels awkward again
then why pick on me?
is
i feel like derpy....
Meanwhile: no, it's NOT possible that you can't FEEL anything. Your not human then......
05because you jsut cathegorized yourself with derpy
05another reason to the list
I always feel like Derpy.
10meanwhile is a baller
10just saiyan
otakon: Congratulations, you uncovered my secret. I am a robot. Beep boop son, beep boop.
Wrek: what were the other reasons?

10iJelly
10^_^
:D
/me thats a horrible apple product
10no u D:
luckily i have been remembering my dreams lately
Lucky
This is uncanny. I remember a personality test that said I'm most similar to Rainbow Dash
iJelly? theres an app for that... probably...
10I can never remember them for the life of me... I've been tempted to do the dream diary stuff, but I never get round to iy
10it*
05try dreaming you are samurai jack fighting of timberwolves from ponyville
/me MASf123
05best dream ive had in a while
And she isn't even my favourite
10Sorry DaringDude, you got 1-Up'd
Not yet, anyway
i know lol
10xD
dat Wrek
/me remembers under-roos, those are good days.
ive been dreaming that im in the Fallout: Equestria universe... its surreal and awesome at the same time
:O
That was a fanfic in ED
I know
The last dream I had was in Avalar from Ripto's Rage
I dream of tubs of jelly
Dang, my dreams can be rather perverse
Ah, before Spyro started to suck
Ain't gonna say nothing about them
me gusta
/me tacos
my next dream is probably gonna be the same as the last... but now im probably gonna see samurai jack and timberwolves somewhere in it ._.
TACO TIEM
burrito tiem
/me pony time
You're waiting for a train...
NO.
Wrek: are you happy now?
Can't remember how the rest goes
05hmm?
/me chimichanga tiem
MASF123: Yep. It was Crush, Gulp, and Ripto chasing me through the reals and I reached a dead end and last thing I remember was Gulp opening his mouth
/me must watch Inception again
I'm waiting for a train? I hope it's full of tacos
nope, spiders
damnit
/me and fish
spiderfishes
/me is okay with spiders
I like spiders.
Gulp is very dim-witted the only thing that reminds me of MLP in Spyro is Spike
EGAD brainfood!
But I'd still rather have tacos
Or sushi
05come again otakon?
05i gotta leave in a few minutes
Wrek: ya done run off a chatter for no real reason.
But Spike actually shows intelligence, whereas Gulp is sort dimi.-witted, like you said
Now now
no real raisin
/me spider fish tacos...unshaven
wat.
10>for no real reason Otakon, you must be tripping balls
No..I ment that Spike reminds me of Spyro himself
What did she do?
05are you drunk or something?
no
I'm not.
then what did she do?
Ooohh. Makes sense. I will admit, I had a fangirl crush on Spyro when I was younger.
what rules did she break?
/me moist cures most
Aha!!! I knew you were a girl!
I broke a rule once
/me wants all bronies to get along :'(
/me prepares long-winded story
10The entire chat was herp derpalerping over one person's innane rantings. When someone clogs the chat with 'I'm leaving, you're mean to me because of (x)' while quoting irrelevent 'evidence' (y), they are doing more harm than good for the chat :S
Yep
Yep. I'm female. One day I'm going to buy the Spyro collection
Yeah, Spyro is awesome, just like Spike. They are such young dragons
One day I'm going to eat fugu
lol Mahboi777 me too i got kicked lol
And make sure it's properly prepared
And if it kills me I'm going to be mildly ticked off.
05RainBroDash, skype if you please

/me is jealous of RainBroDash for being able to hear Wreks voice

VioletVanilla: I had a fangirl crush on Kakashi from Naruto when I was 13/14
I haven't played Spyro in forever.

06o: I was fangirl crush on Neji <3
MASF123: Get Year of the Dragon game. It is awesoome! You get to skateboard
I hatez the Naruto...conversation ended
Maybe he's born with it, maybe it's maybelline.
That's all I can hear when Neji is mentioned.
Yeah there are 3 demo levels
Mon Petit
And there's a cheat you can enter that will turn your skateboard into a squid. Dead serious.
Phase4 lol dat robot
Dang, I lost interest in Naruto about halfway through
Never heard of that cheat
/me is doing a physics lab
robots have taken over the Navy
I started reading Naruto when I learned it's further ahead and has no filler. I'm still reading it.
DaringDude: its trying again right now, hopefully it will go away and leave me alone
You can still look up the cheat codes for the Spyro trilogy online
I pretended to like it before to have my friends talk to me once. :(
I had read the manga until part 2 and then I stopped
How did you get in a chat with it/
I never liked Naruto though
It's okay by my standards
I'm in a chat??:O
/me za za za za za za za za za za za za za za za
I liked Naruto until Shippuuden when it started to get into those damn fillers
Wait, this is a chat!?
IKR??
Nowai
This is really long gif
Za Warudo?
Like, you had maybe 3, 4 episodes, and episodes 5 to 20-or 30-something was the Rescue Gaara arc, and right after that was another fillers

Hey guys, what happened to Silver_Streak?

I miss Silver_Steak
And then I fell behind about 5 episodes because the computer broke and I just said "fuck it" and gave up. My brother reads the manga
Can't remember if it's notebook or desktop version though.
One of them?

SilverStreak uses a couple of name variations depending on the PC.

RainBroDash: so your saying it's fine to insult someone here is that it? isnt' that against the rules? She called him mean, he kicked her she came back, asked why he was hurting her feelings and his response? BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY. Then he goes on to deride her further saying she shouldn't be here and says "and then maybe you are stupid for hanging out in a place like this"
10ThatsAShinySky oh haaai there

Hello Dashie_Dashie
I'm afraid to show my hideopus face, lol
Hokaay
Reboot!
*hideous
shouldnt take to long with linux
To mend and defend.
Linux...*seethes*
Does anyone remember Reboot?
<--
/me has what would be a handsome face if it weren't still plagued with acne
I DO
Is that a TV series? It sounds familiar....
We watch it on the stream from time to time Meanwhile.
It was
From like the 90's
What was it about?
Dashie_Dashie: I know, I was here for the last one.
Polydunami: curse this acne!
o
ReBoot! That is a show from my childhood
The inside of a computer, viruses and protection software and computer puns everywhur
ah good times
Bob Megabyte Enzo Hexadecimal Mouse Dot etc.
I don't remember ever watching it but it sounds familiar. It really does.
oh Toonami, how I miss thee
Shizu streams Reboot, Beast Wars and Wishbone from time to time
Or I'm probably thinking of something else
Maximise!
Beast Wars. That's almost as old as I am
Terrorize.
Sailor Moon.
Another childhood show
Same with Sailor Moon
I miss Ruroni Kenshi, DBZ, Zoids, Gundam, and Dragon ball from toonami.
Mother of god I watched Sailor Moon before I even knew how to spell those words.
I miss Toonami period
Although my mom never let my sister watch that
Why not?
Fighting evil by moonlight?
Sailor Moon, teaching how to make your daughters dress in skimpy outfits since 1997.
They wern't that skimpy if you think about it. Compared with the clothes they have today
Yep
True.
Well, they expose exactly the wrong type of skin depending on where you're from
But I swear I saw a flash of underwear when they transformed into Sailor Scouts. Which probably explains my...weirdness...
It has to come to my attention that I really need some nutrition. Brb.
/me is a straight male. His first anime was Sailor Moon
/me brohoofs Polydunami
Sailor Moon was my first anime, ever.

Goodgood
I have 5 IPs with a 376mb RAM server for $10
Thats good
It's not touching anything. Like, the part that keeps the USB cord in LITERALLY broke off. It's nothing but an empty space there

Most places wont give you that many ips

Hey all
Hi Snuffsis.
hiya
Snuffsis: Long live Lenin, kill the tsar! We salute the sickle and star!
You know what is awesome?
Ponies.
Google X Offices, top secret laboratory
^
Where they try to invent a space elevator, a fridge that is connected to the internet and automatically orders food when you're running low on it and several other things
I would totally want that fridge
wat
But what if I don't want it to?
What if I just want a pizza?
I'm sure you can set it to order certain things and ignore other things. :P
Otherwise it would just order every singlt thing you don't have in your fridge
Slerp.
I have a refresher.
So we reject free enterprise, and once again the left will rise.
hnn?
Prepare the flags to be unfurled, 'cause we're seceding from the world. We shall regain the Georgian soil. We shall obtain the Arctic oil.
Dafuq. My phone fell out. of my habd
Good job.
http://www.google.com/patents?id=FX-FAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4#v=onepage&q&f=false this is how the fridge will work
Pokerface
a fridge integrated with the internet, NICE! Im sure it has a built in computer, by the sound of it, where you can order whatever you want
I hope I can put it on "pause".
It's already in existence.
I have one.
Check the flowchart i just posted kammerjunk. you can set it to ignore
Neat-o.
but how does the physics work, right now we could only send bits of information using internet, not in physical form... :(
Set minimum proper amount of stored food article = -1
I want to see what happens.
It checks if there is few traces of amounts of whatever you want in your fridge, if so, it outputs ordering info on the screen, wherre you can choose to ignore purchase or procdd
I just introduced a guy to MLP. Win?
Good on ya.
valoreins... They would obviously connect to stores that deliver food to your doorstep... :P
I still can't believe that at the protest against ACTA I was to the 25th, no one recognised my Dashie shirt.
Haha
i thought it works like teleport the food to the fridge lol
Lol.
Seriously. It's like the Internet gathered in the capital, and no one knew about ponies.
Haha. Shame on them.
valoreins. that would be fucking awesome, but then that wouldn't lead to just fridges, we'd be able to teleport to the moon and other things... :P
i was thinking in sci-fi way 6_9
Actually, I think it's very likely that we achieve the ability to freaking teleport, and then we use it for our fridges.
The moon is boring. There are no ponies there. Luna isn't there anymore.
That sounds very human to me.
tea, earl grey, hot
i thought there are rebel ponies in the moon
Wut.
that would be awesome :D
Thank you for reminding me, Snuffsis, I have not had a cup today.

Now that we are on TF2, i always for some reason thought of Discord as the Medic.
00,10So yeah, Rarity is spy right?
I have no clue why.
Rarity is best spy
THAT PRANCIN SHOW PONY IS A SPY
NowCarefulDerpy: That's terrifying and awesome at the same time.
^
00,10And Dash is scout.
dash is best scout
but rainbows make scout cry
Applejack is best engineer
so how would that work?
I always saw Spike as the Soldier, to be honest.
LOLNO
ofna01: That was obviously Rarity making fun of Dashie.
Spike is Demoman
no no
Fluttershy is best sentry
O_O
00,10so what does that meen Rarity slept with Dashes mom?
DEMODEMOPAN!
zecora is demoman
Yeah, I don't really know why I saw Spike as the Soldier.
http://img.ponibooru.org/images/3d/3d57f1a1f40278b3fcd0b038342f33b7

Heavyquest
Fluttershy as the medic..that's..i guess that fits too.
Bum ba num bumma nun, nunna hunna.
NO
NowCarefulDerpy: No, I think I like Discord as the Medic.
Fluttershy is Medic
Brodyquest.
Such a catchy tune.
It fits in with my already oatmeal-filled headcanon.
friendship is medic
RawketLawnchair: IKR

Also, I drew a pony.
fluttershys personality doesnt really fit medic though :/
may we see RawketLawnchair ?
http://i40.tinypic.com/140xkt5.jpg Look, it is a pony.

Cool :)
Wait.
huh,wha?
Drawing with a mouse is hard.
I can suddenly load tinypic.
RawketLawnchair: Yes it is.
How is this possible.
RawketLawnchair: Tell that to Wrek.
Wrek is full of hacks.
Tell me about it, i always seem to draw out the line when i attempt to draw with my mouse.
leeeeeets doooiiiiiit!
I did what I could. And it's not that bad, but it's not that good either.
I will draw Derpy next.
Stout Shako for two refined!
not one of you is gonna survive this!
I personally think that drawing is nice.

Hey maybe when the new ep comes out maybe we can go to the AJ room to look at it togeter?
I guess, is it as dead a s the rarity room?
CountDoofus, stop standing in the corner. Come up to the stage and dance. You won't get any ladies if you're standing in the corner. Stupmumbling talk out of your beard!
No AJ is my fav pony
the next episode will be a fluttershy one i just feel it
Yes it is
but... my XBox is there... :$
Pah
oh right, still need to get my ponies out of their packaging, brb
What?
<RainBowJack> the next episode will be a fluttershy one i just feel it <-- where did you get that from? Wikipedia? :P
http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/File:Pony_School_Pals_playset_with_Cheerilee,_Apple_Bloom,_Scootaloo_and_Sweetie_Belle.jpg
That sounded so wrong countdoofus. :P
no i just have a feeling
because of the titel
Fluttershy is best pony
Oh ye with dirty thoughts
^_^
Count sorry about of what i sayed
Not dirty thoughts, more like insane person thoughts. Like you had packaged ponies in boxes and suffocated them to death, or kidnapped them or something.
dirty?
@ RainBowJack:
fluttershy is best pony

Heh...
Photon: don't post it. I almost got banned when I did

08,01Snuffsis: well, no; i can report it to a mod, who *will* kick/ban on my recommendation
08,01RainBowJack: i'm doing so right now, in fact
Plese dont!

i would love to have a rainbowdash costume
Dken2021, you can get banned for being a jew, so why not being a furry?
/me Holds Party Grenade stuff

Aww...Horse apples. :|
/me Facehoofs
how did i get into mlp? saw a know your meme episode
filtered over into ponies the anthology and that got me interested
For me it was that and some Pinkie clips
Tell sunday MASF tell sunday
tell me what?
Me..Looking it on my i pod
Tell him what? About Silver_Streak?
YES!
Um...She got banned?
Didn't know her too well
And be cuase of her being jewish
I only talked for her in like 2 days or 3....
And..What was his name agin?
Though I'm guessing she uncovered some ancient conspiracy involving lost gold and the illuminati and was "taken"
She was Jewish? :O Well that explains everything!
jk
Bingo was his name'o
you don't get banned because of your religion
Wrek made fun of her
That could be it too
well i've to go cee you all
laters Saigneur
Have fun Sai
let's play league of legend ^^
cya Saigneur
was it a perma-ban?
Maybe she wasn't banned but left because of being insulted too much
/me shrugpony
Doesnt he know always be nice to the other ones?
wait...
What?
you mean you don't use real anti-personel grenades for the party grenade?
You dont?!
Oh my, I've got to fix something
We are not talking about that mela
Jim, someone said something about water, i don't get it...
You think C4 does the same trick?
but if that's the case, umm... well i've been tossing a couple party grenades into every party i come across

09,01You know what we streamers REALLY hate?
09,01when we get heckled.
09,01We don't get paid for streaming y'know, so yeah.
YMCA rangers
Pleaseeeeeeeeee....NewDCD.......Pleaseeeeeeeeeeee.....
wtf is this???
08,01NewDCD: put on star trek! put on andromeda! put on kamen rider! pleeeeeeeeeasassasasae!
08,01:P
NOOOO
applejack096: i think its power rangers
NewDCD dont worry, we love you for streaming Gokaiger.
Wouldn't take it personally DCD, I usually like to sit back and make fun of everything I watch like I'm on MST3K
08,01what are you all watching?
Gokaiger
I realize that the shows I had no intrest for as a kid I would actually watch now.
japanese power rangers while im drawing? "im ok with this"
go elements of harmoney!
09,01that's fine, but do you have any idea how much our streamers get bothered for the shows they stream .___. or the original content they make
/me hugs NewDCD
Uncheck, i don't get it :o
I'm not copmplaining, it's awesome
NewSCD Star trek episode
Im tierd of this........
/me licks Pinkieruler124
why would anyone complain about something being done for them for free?
yes, I see it everything I'm here. So I guess that's why Dari has so much fun trolling the audience
RJ Is right
crossing the 7 seas in a flying ship
seems legit
RainbowcrashNBurn: Because people are weird
09,01exactly. EVERY FREAKIN' DAY .___.
Look we are tierd of this...
people complain?
thats news to me
who's complaining?
09,01no, you are : I
What doesn't kill you or grind your brain into paste from consistant irritation, only makes you stronger
09,01and as I said
pirate ranger !!!!
09,01if you don't like it, go do something else
or more willing to troll
/me Covers phase's mouth
I like alot of what the stremers show. Most of it are things Ive never heard of. This one included. I havent watched power rangers in years, had no idea the show has gotten this good
/me isnt trying to and is sorry if it seems that way
captain mare do well
Exactly, this is awesome to many people, Love or Tolerate it!
not disliking it, just new to me
Sorry for that :(
09,01personally I don't like the whole "Love and Tolerance" thing
09,01but that's just me
09,01Luka MILFy
:'(
It can get a bit pretentious
09,01the main problem with it
if violence doesnt solve all your problems, you arent using enough
I admit, I never took a liking to Power rangers, but that was because my little brother would annoy me with it.
I do. Because it annoys the crap outta folk that try to annoy you.
AttackWithHugs: And if that doesn't work, use duct tape
IM RIDEING SOLO!!!!!!!
09,01is that Bronies confuse "Tolerance" with "Moral Blindness"
feelin like a star
you can't stop my shine
RoboGerbil: obviously what you need to do then is AttackWithHugs :P
09,01and "Love" is not something that should be given freely, it should be earned, when bonds are made between people
Jim: This was years ago when I was about 9 years old. He had about every Power rangers action figure
That dude is AWESOME!
08,01NewDCD: exactly. one wouldn't "tolerate" hitler.
Newborn cutie's ! Newborn cutie"s!
He even had one that comes up to my thigh. But he grew out the phase
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.
0,14mfw GOKAIGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER
09,01but if you don't "manufacture" these two things, chances are you'll be ostracized from the fandom
/me wields Love and Tolerance like a club and hits haters with it.
So by that logic, you should recieve before you give?
09,01so pretty much
g2g bye
I agree with you NewDCD
Britsh!
08,01intolerence is how revolution is born
I think I'll start watching it
hai SaxyPretender
09,01"Love and Tolerate, or we'll Isolate you"
08,01and revolution is something very dear to my heart
so theres no streams up?
09,01it's a hypocritical mantra
/me nibbles on Pinkieruler124
09,01Gerbil: refresh
Haider pinkie.
There is a stream
Lets look at the show
rage!
ah, wasnt loading for me
What's that huge thing on his head?
but the whole point of 'Love and Tolereate' is in the sense in that you shouldn't annoy someone for no reason and you should try to like them even if it's hard
08,01NewDCD: though, that said, i think it's meant to be metaphorical; it's the value of it that matters, not the blind following of the principle
09,01dat King of Braves voice
/me leaves for real
It's a passive-aggressive conditioned response.
/me bites Pinkieruler124
BYEE
Jim: I think that huge thing IS his head
later applejack096
09,01it sounds good in principle
What is this... I don't... *Head blows up*
bye again applejack096
Owww!
0,14finally, I can partake in one of the old BronyState tradition
09,01but honestly it doesn't work in real life
saddest moment ever
/me goes back to nibbling on Pinkieruler124
speaking of which i need to go now too, bbl #bronystate
DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
bye Phase4
die? who?
08,01i interpret it as "love and tolerate unless it's undeserved"
Really.....
well , this power ranger is weird, c u later
09,01quite frankly love is a mutual feeling that develops after we interact with other people.
what kind of die pinkie pie?
sya
indeed
Pinkie DIEanne Pie?
08,01and "be kind about how you determine deservedness"
Oh the show
in theory i'm going but this show is so funny xD

Well, the aliens in S.P.D. really did look like aliens
you, whitht the chinese copying everything ansd stuff
09,01So yeah. Don't make a big deal out of it.
Those terrifying sillicon aliens!
I'm sorry, but this show is not for my brain. I'll be idling while doing something else
JAPANESE POWER RANGERS!
Let's make a show of it, DCD!
I just take hard NewDCD. I can't help it i really can't... I hate it when i mess up or do something wrong and i don't want to be sad when i know i did nothing wrong but it feels like i did when i didn't. You get it right..?
BIRRRRRRRD
Grr
meh im watching hot shots part deux on my own pc
/me hands out rails
be careful everypony!
hot shots should be streamed some day
RoboGerbil: I love you
09,01Just take it easy. If you take IRC that seriously, well, yeah, dunno what to say, but it wasn't meant to be a big deal.
Look if she did then wouldnt she be banned already
I thought swords caused massive amounts of death, until I learned rails were deadlier.
have the emails for this weeks lottery gone out?
I like how their swords and blasters were designed to look like actual pirate weapons
unfoundbug - yes
i already voted so yeah
Japanese pirate power rangers
09,01Pretty much. She's not banned, so in the end it wasn't meant to be serious
styrofoam has never been so deadly
Good job self!
Why...Wrek ...Why
dat self-promotion
I really can't control my emotions. at all so even on a chat it's a big deal to me....
did I miss anything while I was gone?
neck slice!
"rough around the edges" pppffffrts*Snicker*
Japanese power rangers

that was here when I left so apparently no.
Those suits are awesome
Super Sentai, Stallion_of_War.

LOL!
Stallion_of_War: That's actually sort of an oxymoron since they were always Japanese
I'll call it what I want...
did that guy try to nipple cripple the enemy?
Ah dis music~
LOL
because sharks can fly
Of course
fuck your flying tanks
Anything else...Then this?
Why don't they just screw the formalities and just skip to the final boss fight with the giant robots?
hehe

then they kicked ass
It's cool, obviously
I'd laugh if they all got stabbed then.
Dont question it. Just enjoy.
And I am not a good artist so I think I will not draw for a while
one owuld think pikcing a damn specialistation would make them more effective
what?!
Because they're pirates, that's what they do with their weapons
Veemi hates me for some reason.
do you think they do one take and just go 'right, that's good enough'?
RawketLawnchair: you could keep practicing
These are the WORST disguises EVER!
Hahaha
What was he doing in the bushes?
and yet they keep WORKING
I could, but I don't really have the passion for it
Or something
These guys are damn mooks.

ROAR

10INNIT BLUD
The thing is, even if there is a meet up close to me, I won't be able to go. My family might react badly to find out I am a brony.
And now I realize that I made Derpy so small. http://i43.tinypic.com/2zi7ou9.jpg
So I resized her.
BritishBrony: just say you're going out to meet some mates

Aweshum.

Well there was a stream. But it went poof.

I'll ask it about PONIES!
Otakon: Not a good idea, the more popular something is, the easier it is for him to guess
the akinator knows EVRYTHING
you can't beat him with ponies

Dark__Horst: what should I try then?
a PONY is supposed to slip his knowledge? won't ahppen
The key to beating Akinator is to think of a character that you wouldn't ordinarily think of right away
Okya
Nice try, Rainbro.
I know who I'm going to use

fair enough.
Not planning on 'sleepig' anyway.
is someone recording his voice?
we need THESE SOUND CLIPS
Bliemy Britishbrony, even with a cuppa that's quite early.
otakon: im pretty sure its the same thing...just otaku is the japanese word for it. i think
otakon, I couldnt get audio :/ thats why im doing screen shots
kenne88: no, not the same thing.
ill look it
up
kenne88: no, it's not
NewDCD gife me some of your pills
weeaboos want to be japanese, I think
otakon: just think what vi could do with it :D
OMGYES emangamer
being a fan of anime does not make him a weeaboo
/me wishes he could continue to watch but he has work to do :(
and you thought mod punk was good....
emangamer: indde
dat indde
no photos until ad goes

hia! what's going on?
NewDCD chill
lol
00,10So is any one listening to DCD tell the story or just enjoying the acting?
Iwubponiez: major otaku-gasm's
I'm pretty sure GokaiCanary has been cracking up this entire time
he has power Rangergasums
Sumica: the acting, too much damn lag
GokaiCanary: you okay?
Yes :3
I am super pleased.
In modern Japanese slang, the term otaku is most often equivalent to "geek".[3] However, it can relate to a fan of any particular theme, topic, hobby or any form of entertainment.[4] this is what i got and it sounds pretty similair
Sumica: I'm listening to the story, but I've read it twice. so I'm enjoying both
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: wish i could but then it will pile up and i will fail uni :(
You must have some GUNDANMS NewDCD
mechina?
Phase4 D: then work fast~ :) so you can watch DCD
haha i knew it lol!
I love Anime
00,10ah, I dont even know what he's saying. the music is kinda loud.
XD If you wanted to be Japanese then you'd be a Weeaboo.
phase, you could get another monitor and do both work and bronystate
LIEK OMG KAWAII DESUUU
kenne88: no, a weeaboo is someone OBSESSED with popular japanese culture to the point of wishing they were Japanese.

HE PUNCHED HIM OUT OF HIS SPCKS

GokaiCanary: I'm beginning to think you like japan...a lot
...

>implying I am a weeaboo.
*thwap* owwwwwwwww
dat fanslap
GokaiCanary: I dont even know what that is...
I think GokaiCanary likes a lot of things... a lot.
im a weaboo
^
To ScootaChicken's comment.
I can totally read that
i prefer otaku though...
I do.
hey guys guess what
he just read it
my addon got reviewed :3
otaku does not equal weeaboo.
I can totally think it's a pretty pattern and they still would beat me.
I don't really like that much anime
am I a bad person?
emangamer: it's someone who obsesses over japanese pop culture to the point of becoming some non-sense spouting idiot.
#dischord
GokaiCanary: correct
aww its over
was it a positive review?
thats right
ScootaChicken: no, it does that
Not at all ScootaChicken.
/me sings happily along
i just did that
this theme song
ok
gokaicanary: BUT SOMEONE TOLD ME THAT. liars...
this is trippy
no one likes me chat
well it's not that
it's a rule is all
that's not true

Oh Marvey. Always hungry~
<3 that song
so many rangers ._.
I haven't seen him for ages...
/me sings along.
what is this?
GokaiCanary: you can sing along?
I know some of the words to this song, yes.
ezio: original form of the power rangers.
you know, I dont know why, but I get the feeling that this show has some product placement
well
you don't say
not product placement
otakon not that hard, right :3
but advertisement
I see NewDCD swinging on this song right now
sounds a bit like the DBZKai theme
emangamer: what clues you in? the CONSTANT action figures they pull out of no where?
Seriously
lalalalalalala
La La La La
that Parrot either needs to be a damn super weapon or get blown up.
/me hugs SuperBrony64 <3
meh soul eater is better
SB64 loves that song
ezio: never seen it so can't say.
i love that song too <4
<3
Cid <3 <3
and then the return of the LAG!
watch it its a really good anime
judging from the angle that comet is about to hit the earth, I'd say it's aiming for Belgium. Welcome Luna! I've been expecting yo- *SPLAT*
UNF Cid <3
ezio: I would but I don't know how the find it...
CountDoofus: lol
S-sorry. I just REALLY like these characters.

GokaiCanary: it's okay dear, we ALL have shows like that.

Snuffsis: not too much

/me 11,01cooks ScootaChicken

GokaiCanary: oh...I didnt think thats how that worked

" And lo I saw a premanition. I saw the final battle for the internet in which a monster with the name of ACTA rose up against all surfers, bronies, trolls, bloggers, surfers, furries, otakus, mods, and haters. They combined and formed a warrior who shouted LEROY JENKINS! and struck the beast in the heart. when it was over everyone celebrated with the nyan cat song...."
/me hugs Nittany_Discord <3
rubber pantys
suddenly a wall of text
this :<
out of nowhere, textwall
ScootaChicken: run! before your eaten
that is an interesting Y in my word
sry
robotdragon6: that wall of text, YES!
he may be over reacting
robotdragon6: that is exactly how it will happen
Canarys hero got bitchslapped.
Oh no.
lol
He's not my hero.
he wont stay still
damn brat
have less coffee dude
MY hero isnt here yet.
SEE!
there goes My Hero
XDDDDDD Marvey likes food.
watch him as he goes
Eating tons of food heals wounds FASTER!
GokaiCanary: dont we all?
FRIED SCOOTALOO!
oh no, so much food, now I'm getting a stomach ache again
bandaids heal everything
Meh, you seem to have an awful lot of admiration for someone not your hero then. :P
otakon: that and sensu beans
otakon: no you don't.
emangamer: yh, that and sensu beans.
09,01dat First Mate Fabulous
ScootaChicken: ohreally?
XD
Hey everypony!! Is anyone doing the Derpy song chorus and can help me out? D:
so, if these guys are pirates, doesnt that make them the bad guys?
another explosion that leaves no trace
/me 11,01glomps emangamer
/me is glomped
ooph
:o
RaveBrony: um I have NO idea what that is, but I'd like to help
i havent watched ponies for 3 DAYS
how are you doing Nittany_Discord ?
No one ever glomps me.
/me glomps Globetrotter
NNNOOO
like a sir.
Yay!
...not creepy at all
/me adjusts his monocle
ahem.
everyone is getting glomped
Alright, im off to do some work. I have a file of about 20 of the best of the screen shots I got, so when I come on next time, Pm me if you want it, kay?
robotdragon6: you are suffering from a Vitamin P defincency, you need PONIES!
Why did the enemy minions just stand there while those two were casually talking?
/me glomps ekips
00,10Off to work, catch you all later.
Makes no sense. T_T
/me hides from the glomping
11,01emangamer: Fine.
*gets vitamins*
/me glomps everyone "SUPPRISE"
bye Sumica <3
Snuffsis: bc that's how it works
Later Sumica ~
cya Sumica
Im trying to record my audio to send in for the chorus of a fan made Derpy version of "Smile".... but im not Entirely sure what to record.... what the Actual song sounds like...or how the girl sung the song in the vid
/me is not glomped
RainbowcrashNBurn: I'm totally glomping you next brony meetup
bye Sumica
I don't even know what "glomp" is ~.~
eek....sorry for that wall
Bye Sumica!
otakon: That's not really a valid argument. xD
/me glomps otakon goodbye
lets see
their technology is flawed
Bai Sumica!
Snuffsis: your arguement is invalid as was the glomp
later Sumica
09,01>Power Rangers will never be this epic
it takes 6 mA of current to kill a human
agreed
Terminator is on a unicorn, your argument is invalid
adding a second person approxmately doubled the resistance3
ScootaChicken: i dont know how to react to that :O
i thought this was power rangers
RaveBrony: look it up then record the chorus while watching the video I suppose?
11,01Typical lightning currents are 30 kA (lower, really).
so we'll assume that the collar gave more than 6 mA though
did someone say resistance 3?
Seriously, WHERE IS THE DAMN ARMY?
Nittany_Discord: whats a good figure.... 10mA?
11,01I dunno.
Your telling me Earth on has ONE PERSON to defend it?
so that means they each had 5 mA running through their body
11,01An Amp is bad.
Hi :P
otakon: That isn't earth though, is it?
hiya Derpy101
EY
thats enough to give them both heart attacks strong enough to kill them
Snuffsis: it is Earth
this looks a lot like power rangers
hello derpy101
Otakon: Hmm, ok.
hi Derpy101
emangamer don't try to apply physics to any shows on tv
Phase4: it is, just in it's original form
Nittany_Discord: not always...sometimes you want high current and low voltage...
lol why we watching japanese power rangerS?
Awww`
Because reasons.
idk XD
ekips: what about the big bang theory
RoflBot: becuase its amazing
RoflBot: bc it's wonderfully over the top
why not Roflbot
Everytime you try to bring in real life physics in a series, god kills a catgirl
Nittany_Discord: thats why transformers are used
Please think of the catgirls
I'm not watching big bang theory emangamer
RoflBot: on another note why arent you?
dont try to apply phyics to any medium meant for entertainment
^
did they say... DARI ranger???
yup
11,01High voltage isn't bad.
tv/film/games all deliberately break physics
haha
09,01Dai. Dai means "great"
Nittany_Discord: no it isnt bad, but it will fry most electronics
Nittany_Discord: i think the cutoff is 30ma, everyone tells you a different number
makes me wonder of these actors really know kung fu or its stunt doubles
i remember that one ~
HNNNG Hurrikenger!!
Phase4: cutoff for what?
09,01MEEEEEEEEEEEEEGARANGER
emangamer: heart attack
lol
11,01Well you don't want high potentials in current-based electronics obviously.
haha MEGARANGER and then she comes and interrupts it
Phase4: it takes 6 mA across the heart to kill somone
that is such a troll
Rampage :o
Nittany_Discord: yea...enter transformers
<3 Abaranger is my favorite.
what was that noise?
GOOOOOOOOOOOORANGER
emangamer: refference? everyone tells me somethign different
he looks like a bug.
otakon you dont want to know :>
dat ding?
Just like Kamen Rider, :3
Phase4: the mythbusters episode yesterday
Ohranger? xD
09,01LIVEMAN
emangamer, thats a debated number
I like this announcer
Starflash: it sounded like a bat.
09,01I love Liveman <3
OhGreen?
Yes.
WTF is OhGreen?
emangamer: ah, k
bye bye every pony
No no, Oh! Great!
Liveman?!
Oh, Green ~
unfoundbug: would you like me to put 6 mA across YOUR heart?
Call ALL the transformations
I am SO CONFUSED
Dem fists.
when did we start to watch Megaman?
lol just 1 gun makes all the difference
too many rangers i don't even know ~
Maaawn
Oh = King in japanese though, so it makes sense
09,01TIMERANGER <3
Oh green = Green king? :P
FLLLLLAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHMAN
DAT EFFECT
emangamer, i generally thought it was 5ma, so no thanks
well, I gotta go, need my beauty sleep ~

nothing more awesome than walking on air
damn, he recoverd fast
suddenly
DAT LIY
unfoundbug: pfft...what a hipster
Dken2021, clouds
burned away their outfits
'An Amp is bad.'
and de-powered in ONE attack
boom
that is NOT a good sign
not when you're a guitarist.
OH SNAP
If it was me
I would have killed them by now
XD
ScootaChicken careful on the capitalization for that :P
ScootaChicken: thats an amplifier...we're talking about ampieres
hiya Silver_Streak wb
Amp is bad for people, amp good for guitarists
hi otakon
DAT PLASTIC RING
unfoundbug: I'm quoting Nittany_Discord, deliberately leaving the capital like that.
though Hv is just plain cool
thats a massive polo
Ampea vs Amplifier
ones current the other is 'volume'
RoflBot: it's actually the hilt guard for a sword IIRC
the shock collar was ages ago.....still debating about that?
lol volume
<3 Shinken Red.
British soilder suit 0_o
a hilt guard?
RoflBot: yeah
hmmm
an Amp is an ampere...an amp is an amplifier
09,01DRESS ATTACK
don't remember the proper name
09,01IS BEST ATTACK
guns work!!
i'm getting the feeling this captain dude is supposed to rip off a certain torchwood character
NewDCD is best fanboy
i dont remember guns in power rangers
Feels like my stream is a bit after.
why dont they re-power?
Power Rangers had a big gun
when they combined everything into a cannon
DAT GASP
man
those are the brothers of the stormtroopers

And I want another Ranger's jacket.

11,01Dress attack?
the outfits are too damn flamboyant for me
GokaiCanary: did you mean the one he was just wearing?
Cellphone to sword? DO WANT...
And now the obligatory flashback scene
NewDCD: Guess who's friend wants to cosplay GokaiBlue :3
Okay everypony, Ima get about 3 hours sleep, then I might be back- so goodnight for now!

Godzilla
...of course giant robots :|
There's the giant monster we all know and love!

Derratsweiger what an oodd name?
Derpy101: godzirra*
dat noise
why do they never just supersize them from beginning?
otakon: He's probably german
of course giant robots riding on lion robots B|
emangamer: but due to international copyright, it is not
driving a giant mech with stearing wheels
Dken2021: dat ausin powers
Snuffsis: makes sense, they LOVE giving villains german names
RainbowcrashNBurn cos it's a weird resuerection supersizer
crap
Lol and they dont mind the city they're running on
Snuffsis: that name is as german as a wombat
Oh baby~ here it comes.

5 minutes later they have caused 3 billion dollars of damage
Told you that sword was way more retarted in mecha mode
otakon: clearly you've never seen scott pilgram

that sword did more damange to the city than the bad guy
Sunset of awesomeness
Starflash That's what she said.
I'm going somewhere else. I don't think I'd be able to handle my mother wandering over and asking why I'm watching Power Rangers

NewDCD: Isn't it also true that the villains in Power Rangers are just dubbed?
RainbowcrashNBurn rewatch learn to hate
Evil coin!
RainbowcrashNBurn: that sucks, but Ep 1 and 2 aren't that good anyway so don't worry about it

Actually, now there are 36, DCD.
Gobuster.
09,0137
Rider is just as long
well in the same range
Lets watch doctor who.
09,01if you count Akibaranger : 3

09,01that said I like Rider better
C-C-COMBOBREAKER
Red pirate is best pirate.
And not to mention, they are for the japanese audience, they're a bit weirder than the rest of us. :P
08,01but then, that's the excuse for G1 - G3.5... :P
09,01because Rider has better plot
and why the fuck do I know that?
G3.5 is not that bad
Rider tends to have better plots yeah
ITS HORRIBLE

09,01AWESOME
It's a giant pirate ship that turns in to a gaint pirate robot crollled bty giant ships wheels and keys and some buttons and navi
Yes.
wait wait
DeadlyDerp3: If we tell you it won't be a surprise will it?
You'd expect their shit to be knocked off the shelves after transforming in to a giant fighting robot
Who?
akared means redred? xD
Cabin Boy!
"I was there too" "shut up"
their just fucking toys
09,01pretty much, but AkaRed is a legacy character
Are you streaming something after this DCD?
Pimp walk.
Jookia it's a space ship it has gravity controll
I love the slow walk
09,01basically, he's the personification of a bunch of Red Sentai Members
Still, that's a tautalogy. *grammarnazi*
Dumori: oh right how could i forget
Awesome.
Basco and Mrav they both love to eat!
09,01rather, a personification of their spirit
Brofist
So, There like gold coins?
also the colour red and badassery
Traitor!
Woops
they are like brothers
OH SHIT
Traitor.

Hazard: It's just for you: http://derpy.me/Zy4AT
Artifical gravity off, everything on shelves is fine
da fuq?
This is reallly funny
Is this what they call a space mutiny? :3
Yes.
Darf14 yeah these guys bleed when they get beat up like real men
he got shut in the upper arm but is clutching his lower arm?
I'm somewhat concerned that a member of this pirate crew became a turncoat purely because he's greedy.
Jim: There arent any railings.
09,01Akared sounds a bit like Amuro
http://derpy.me/R9L1B
/me has stroke from cuteness
power rangers?
I think I see a railing there, watch out
Never expect any version of Power Rangers to have blood
Better set up more railings.
herp-a-derp: LOL
You can hear the thing rattle around XD!
Lava explosion!
Was that a flashback
YOu streaming something after this NewDCD?
AKA Red!
akared sounds like A.k.A red
09,01Sentai =/= Rangers
ir's called gokaiger
...
Hazard: Oh I think that was too much
Doah
So how long before Akared reappears as a cyborg?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/924/
NullRadix: It's true, they do.
...Those things look ridiculous
meanwhile he was playing with his power ranger toys

NewDCD: If you get up to episode 17 today....prepare for me to explode.
My fav part a Ahim is when she's swareing like a sailor and endign every sentance with desu still
Nope.Chuck Testa Deadly
Most Kid shows are toy commercials, even MLP :(
also phraseing them as polite insults...
*Especially* MLP.
Why is the pirate wearing a witch hat?
Lol.
6_9
Not a witches hat. Not as pointy.
XDDD Oh Basco you're such a little fruit.
Wait... what was this called? I'm 99% sure I've seen it before but can't remember the name
I'm sure if they could afford a witch hat, they'd have one
Jookia because hes a traveling witch plundering booby pirtaes
That's one limp tricorn.
Gokaiger, NullRadix
Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger, NullRadix.
Looks like a poor mans tricorn.

09,01jjderp: It's Super Sentai, the footage of these shows are used to make Power Rangers. Also the suits.
Doing those poses has to be so much fun.
Darf14: you obviously have never seen sentai then
gokai green felt himself up

Derpy_Hooves: the only thin that annoys me is that alot of people think ALL bronies are like that

Hey, what happened to Major Kong?
Who is that big tough armored one?
11,01Question: Why the hell would a PC manufacturer password-protect your BiOS from you?
learn to fight
ouch
Dat Starflash
Nittany_Discord: To keep naughty people like you out.
09,01no clue Nitt...maybe it's on the manual?
STEP ON DAT HAND like a boss
Nittany_Discord to piss you the FUCK off?
I have no idea
Ohai SuperBrony64 :3
Nittany_Discord: Capitalism
Red ranger is wasted.
but yeah check the manule
11,01You can't pirate with a BiOS.
Nittany_Discord: because money, they can charge you for it
Explosion tazed
it's likly factory default
D: Marvey!!!
Bingo
Micheal Bay powers activate.
Nittany_Discord: stuffed if i know why they do it
is the stream on ?
Capitalism still sucks though
um
The party has fallen
what just happened?
CCCP: linuxer?
they lost
otakon: you missed everything again?
09,01okay guys
I just got back
Basco entered arsehold mode.
dude Marv you have a gun
09,01guess that's a pretty big cliffhanger
Jookia: no i use PC
Hai :3
11,01It's not real capitalsm.
09,01want the next episode?
ok thats a big cliffhanger
Yes please.
Yay
NewDCD: YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.
Epic cliff hanger DCD
CCCP: but linux is a pc
Yes
NewDCD: your gonna sotp it aren't you?
Next episode!
yes
New episode please :=
09,01okay then, one more Gokaiger
I should go to bed but one more I can do
Capitalism will lead to corruption by default.
Because Episode 17, my husbando comes in.
Jookia: if he doesnt understand that hes not a linux user
Yaaaay
Its a cliff hanger .... so yes DCD
i don't think we could leave this unanswered
You Rock, woohoo
yay!
What's Gokaiger? O___O
SuperBrony64: power rangers but AWESEOM
He gets the silver spotlight, no?
how will i sleep without knowing some resolution to whatever this is
SO whats next
Jookia: it is? Well i dont know much about lunex
He's got all the incentive in the world to do so.
i honestly have no idea whats going on
Oh cool :3
seen*
oh snap
Though never really liked Power Rangers tbh.
ohai doctor_whooves127
hi
09,01neither did I, 64
SuperBrony64: neither did i, this is better
11,01Password-protecting BiOS is about as dumb as Ubisoft DRM.
I SHALL MAKE YOU CRY: http://derpy.me/nfESy
Nittany_Discord: my computer has no DRM
Nittany_Discord annoying, but easy to get around with a crack
CrazyBronyDonut: I have seen it before but that is still AMZING! OMG I <3 U!!!
Nittany_Discord: is this the windows 8 thing?
MelaPonie didn't know about cupcakes
PAssword-protected bios is really simple to break through though, atleast from my experience.
not a single tear was she that day
cool CCCP
shed*
megazords!
Nittany_Discord you looked for the factory default for you Mboard/bios
11,01I'm using a comparison on how dumb and practically worthless the idea is.
YourLittleDashie: you did not succeed.
YourLittleDashie: :'(
And not a single tear was SHIT that day
lol nittany, just pull the bios battery and reset the bios, that should get rid of any passwords
YourLittleDashie: not cring just empty inside thats all
Groan.
11,01RoboGerbil: That's the only option I see from online searches.
Brony4Life: Oh well
Just told her hehehe
Basco?
really?
CCCP: *Dashie hugs you*
drm keeps stock holders happy, even if it doesnt fulfill its primary purpose
:)
Basco is badass
Panic Navi ^^
Richard Stallman advises you to use no passwords
Hey listen!
if what Nittany_Discord is talking about is the windows 8 signed boot its a bit more than a password and a lot more scary. if its just a normal pc being sold now then its silly
unfoundbug: eeyup
Hey Hey Listen
don't dis Basco Ottercan he'll fuck you up hard
nittany, is it a dell?
Phase4: the first rule about secureboot is not to talk about it
11,01Phase4: It's an old XP Media Center model.
Nice ringtone.
Nittany_Discord: ah
11,01What's this about W8 signed boots?
i love how green starts running before everybody else
Phase4: The windows 8 thing is supposedly really simple to just turn off though. It's just there to prevent people from accidentally altering anything when they don't know what they are doing.
windows 8 was ruined as soon as they said "metro ui"
Phase4: i live in australasia
Snuffsis: on x86 machines, not on arm
"Let's remove a bunch of features from Home and through in a fancy interface for Windows Media Player and call it Windows XP Media Center Edition!!"
ill brb guys, i have to do homework T_T:|
windows 8 looks like ass
Jookia: AUS BRONY
have fun Derpy101
throw*
Im not liking the look of Windows 8 either
nittany_discord if its a dell theres a separate bios jumper on the mb to lock the bios
windows 8 boot in a nutshell is that your computer will only run what the manufacturer approves
does anypony here have a mac?
/me hugs Jookia
11,01It's Toshiba.
11,01*a
think ill stick with 7 until 9
Jookia: i'm australian
11,01The HD stopped functioning this morning.
Phase4: I'd brohoof you but I can't be arsed typing /me
Try Ubuntu!
It's very easy to use :)
it's still on power rangers?
11,01Ubuntu is unstable as hell.
09,01*Super Sentai
09,01and yes
Ubuntu is the best pokemon ;P
Aaaaand bitch slap.
Tor is best search engine
i kinda agree with Nittany_Discord , compiz bugs out a lot on ubuntu
Dumori: dat xkcd
Try fedora core
bitch kick? wait what
Yeah but I'd heard it b4
he didn't the joke
Arch linux!
I use Ubuntu, Its good once you fix it up a bit
Nittany_Discord: okay, I'm not really using it for anything important, I'll take your word for it.
Basco, if he didn't talk I'd assume he's a chick.
I own a Mac ^_^
Ubuntu is nice
damn, i need to go

My client marks you out as such
09,01no, I hinted it. Someone else blew it : 3
....
ALWAYS.
NewDCD: GODDAMMIT. D8 NOOOOO
Bored -_- imma go somewhere else, by all
otherwise we'd allow us to be marked automatically
CK|Asleep that's some nice sleep typing you have there.
Every. Single. Time. Always enter chat on the weirdest line.
It's some sort of cosmic law.
broken syntax sentence was broken
09,01welp, you guys, just forget that
...

Awesome

Forget what?

NewDCD is Garp.
/me 11,01dusts MakerDusk
09,01oh, I meant to forget the fact that I went on cam
09,01and read stuff out loud
But it was silly :3
...SHOE
but there are pics and everything
oh never NewDCD
09,01FORGET IT
That was just epics
CONSPIRICAY!
OMG I LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE DO THAT TO A LIVE AUDIENCE
DCDstractions are the best!
Are those pirate Power Rangers on the stream? O.o
guise, I've forgotten what we're supposed to forget
Yes CriticKitten.
09,01also I wonder where I could see these pictures
DeadlyDerp3: of course there are multiple network conspiracies going on
09,01more like...where could I see the captions
....but....
Tears are like.. streaming down my face.

and then they got their action figures
just swinging her sword(s) looking bored

Okay, I apologize in advance for this reference, but I can't resist.
Wateru. LOL.
Sure. why not.
Getsuga....TENSHOU.
Of course, or else it would be pointless
otakon nope it has a "bag of holding" chest safe thing
09,01CK: That reference was bad and you should feel bad.
Dumori: oh
NewDCD: Already there.
don't know what you were referencing but I guess it was horrible
HAha
Couldn't stop myself though.
09,01Bleach.
CriticKitten: Senbon Zakura Kageyoshi.
Chouginga Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann!

xD
does anyone remember mystic knights? that medieval power rangers thing?
lol Meanwhile
Meanwhile /)
But this current one is the last one
for now
09,01Mystic Knights of Tir Na Gog
09,01yeah, I do.
GokaiCanary: (\
oh my god
Meanwhile: lol
Mystic Knights = awesome.
NewDCD: ohmygod
09,01it was surprisingly decent (because it was a fully original production...)
Tir Na Gog now I know my celtic myth
And now I'm forced to think of the pirate rangers' "zord" as akin to Date's motorcycle horse because too much anime.
but I didn't knwo there was a rangers for it
Wasn't it Tir Na Nog?
I might have to check it out
if it's decent
I think Tir Na Nog, yeah
OMG DCD. I Have a funny picture of basco to show you.
of god the pink battle fever
that is creepy man
I loved the Mystic Knights! :D No one I knew seemed to remember that show, I was afraid perhaps it was a creation of my overactive imagination.
i think it WAS tir na nog
so what we watching next?
IDKY but the Gokai verson hits uncanny vally like a train over here
dr. who ?
...
Aaaand I cant find it.

Well, this is pretty cool.

Idk where he got that but even that robot parrot seems like a better option for Silver ranger.
09,01DEM ROSY PINKS
gokai silver is somewhat badass from what i hear
of course, HIS tranformation gets the special treatment
<3 and awesome theme song.

Ingwaz: D'AAAWWWWW
NERF THAT SHIT
ohai Aircrafter
A Trident is a speat with an Axe on it :P
/me swoons
Gormin are made of expolodium everypony knows that
Pft
Sorry GokaiDecade, Never realized ._.
Power Rangers were corny but fun.
09,01nah it's okay
09,01one learns something every day
What the original 5 Gokaiger just said applies to my opinion of silver right now.
It's just a bladed trident
This is pretty much the same sort of goofy fun attitude.
I've learned...I am soshwart :L
Also, a friend of mine was actually supposed to draw a picture of chibi me with chibi Gai, LAST YEAR but she never got to it but she got to other drawings....
nope, a spear with an axe head is a pike
Crap, he's got an AT field~
GokaiSilver: Surprisingly, I kinda know that feel.
a trident is a spear with three tips. three = tri
get it?
It was supposed to be me giving Gai a peck on the cheek and him blushing.
/me feels like a boss knowing what gokaiger and super sentai was before streaming episodes
Insan is epic troll!
lol just desserts
