Uncheck, i don't get it :o
I'm not copmplaining, it's awesome
NewSCD Star trek episode

RJ Is right

/me Covers phase's mouth
/me isnt trying to and is sorry if it seems that way
Sorry for that :(
09,01personally I don't like the whole "Love and Tolerance" thing
09,01but that's just me
09,01Luka MILFy
:'(
It can get a bit pretentious
09,01the main problem with it
I admit, I never took a liking to Power rangers, but that was because my little brother would annoy me with it.
I do. Because it annoys the crap outta folk that try to annoy you.
feelin like a star
you can't stop my shine
09,01and "Love" is not something that should be given freely, it should be earned, when bonds are made between people
That dude is AWESOME!
Newborn cutie's ! Newborn cutie"s!
0,14mfw GOKAIGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER
09,01but if you don't "manufacture" these two things, chances are you'll be ostracized from the fandom
09,01so pretty much
g2g bye
Britsh!
08,01intolerence is how revolution is born
I think I'll start watching it
09,01"Love and Tolerate, or we'll Isolate you"
08,01and revolution is something very dear to my heart
09,01it's a hypocritical mantra
09,01Gerbil: refresh
Haider pinkie.
There is a stream
Lets look at the show
rage!
What's that huge thing on his head?
but the whole point of 'Love and Tolereate' is in the sense in that you shouldn't annoy someone for no reason and you should try to like them even if it's hard
/me leaves for real
It's a passive-aggressive conditioned response.
BYEE
Owww!
saddest moment ever
speaking of which i need to go now too, bbl #bronystate
DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
08,01i interpret it as "love and tolerate unless it's undeserved"
