He seems like less of a jackass than henry ford

03right when Microsoft released the 320GB, I bought a Caviar Blue, he flashed firmware and did some funky crap

YAY
Cause Luna is a foxy pony
Me Gusta
03dafuq,I thought all official Xbox drives were WD
You flash it with the firmware of the drive the right size/etc so the xbox accepts it

Woah you go big guy!
I used to be augmented, But then I took a shotgun to the face
Korra doesnt need helmets
03yeah apparently he flashed a WD to show up as a Seagate
Those masks...
03now my question is, are there any tools that can show it as a WD without flashing firmware?>
03just out of curiosity
inb4 that chief guy is a double agent
02LOL
FUCK YES I FINALLY LEARNED TO BIKE!
00,10flood raid

13spot check fail
00,10rock to the nuts
03I wonder what Seagate's Seatools would do XD
13reflex save
I bet douchebag is part of the other extream, the oen that wants to destroy chi blocking and moving bending into a place of unshakeable power.
....all the pain..
dayum, that was too easy
<.<
dat timing...
all the benders have two forms of bending do airbenders have two forms too
Would probs see it as a seagate
03hm
Tarloc is surprisingly adept for a politician
03also LOL
he just wants some boob
that went better than expected
If you want to return it, you will need to reflash it as a WD
03the WD has some sort of jumper crap
03uh
03no
...lol hunchback..
xmasskills avatars can bend all elements
00,10yes they can not only bend wind they can also break wind
03I'm abusing Amazon's return policy, don't tell anybody
Two Forms?
/me hides
I used to be a bender just like you, But then I took a Chi to the face
"Failed to locate"?
ADADADADADAD
13IT'S TIME

Unless they test it and say "lolno"
03they're stupid, they're just like "Yep, item's there, here's youre money back"
bwhahaaha!
Smart girl
Bad idea is bad.
13TO DU-DU-DU-DU-D-D-D-D-DUEL
03why the frick woudl they test it
"Oh mai, why can't WE do something and YOU have to do everything, why"?
"Cause your dumb"
03they're a warehouse, not a OEM
03Microsoft might test it and go "wait, what"
03but by that point it's too late
03:P

Please Sumica? =3
do the Smile Song by TheLivingTombstone
00,10please what?
The original of Discord
03and Lighty yeah, ATI is AMD's graphics department
Tovler: well that is the only holw in my opinion....
00,10I am not streaming any more
03and in recent years they just got rid of the ATI name and all their graphics cards are released as AMD
funny how the 4th most high score is owned by a brony
Smile song 30% pitch lower is best
Well as its a 2.5inch drive, could be for random laptop power connector
how do you know sumi
we ARE taking over
Oh it' snot you? D: Sorry Sumica
whats this...
?
Who took over? Shizuka?
00,10yep

Sigh
Revolucioooooooooooon

*yawnsighs*
00,10seeing as i have been streaming for like the past 12 hours

''All you have to is take a cup of flourto put yu to trough trances'' That's not flour Pinkie

06tsk, why doesn't dad just have a NVIDEA card >.>
hmm
cya..
06Easier for installing and alot better
this is...interesting for one
and GREAT FOR ANOTHER
02EW compairing NVIDEA and ATi
03laptop cards tend to be a pain regardless who makes them :/
06why that?
03because they're all customized by OEMs and crap
02omparing*
06ikr?
03part of why I love my custom built laptop
02comparing*
Just need a graphic artist to fill up the graphic slots. =3
03I just get the NVIDIA drivers straight from nvidia.com
03no funny stuff needed
03but that's rare, 99% of the time it's not that easy :/
You can normally grab upstream drivers from nvidia or AMD, at least for newer cards
03nope
03my sister's Dell has an AMD
03go to their site and it's like
/me is augmented
03"Sorry, go get them from the OEM"
02NVIDEA and ATi are both pretty much the same if you ask me
hmm
06ATI RS690M, can find it? xD
03it's NVIDIA< first of all
I asked for this song
lies
03Lighty, from the computer manufacturer
03:/
:3
Depends on the card as I said

6ugh
03AMD has crap card
03*s
6I want a tablet PC lol
03so do I

06NVIDIA goes FURTHER, thats the exceptional thing about them
6I'm sick of my tablet right now
03but I want an actual tablet PC, not one of those iPad like crap
I really hope nothing is happening
6it's awkward to draw on
03I want the kind with a real keyboard

DISCORD!
03My friend has one

0314" screen
03or something
6most people here in their last year of school get one
6it's boss for digital animation
because there could be just about anything happening, and I wouldnt know
it just seemed to fit...
The bass cannon was the stupidest thing ever
ACS13123: lolz
03I just want one for the sake of having, LOL
03like
03"gotta take notes, OK *flip*"
DISCORD=Best mlp villan
I doubt that Alister
Alister stupid, but clever
Discord, I'm howlin' at the moonAnd sleepin' in the middle of a summer afternoonDiscord, whatever did we doTo make you take our world away?
Dken2021 No stupid and Retarded
/me shrugs
Alister, you seem to be highly negative
to each their own?
Alister: but yet amazing
6nah, tablet PCs are a staple in art
03well yeah
03but I'm an engineer, not an artist
What you all think about the song? =3
03inb4 <jun> orly
6I shouldn't have gotten my tablet, but I didn't have the money for a Tablet PC
Alister: and strangely effective
great
I bloody love the song
6I'm saving up for one now
this song= eargasm
03tablet as in Wacom tablet or as in iPad type thing
cowvarkian : No I have opinions with wich you do not agree so you automatically assume I hate everything
And now for some classic Polka!
6wacom
03ah
AND BACK TO DISCORD!
03I've got an HP TouchPad which is essentially HP's version of the iPad
no, you just have alot of neggative opinoins Alister
6I mean, there's nothing wrong with it, it's just awkward as hell
03honestly all it's good for is Angry Birds
03LOL
*spelling
03that and maybe Draw Something if I ever get Android fully working
03as LOL small phone screens
cowvarkian : You can't have good without bad
6honestly I'd love to get an Asus
How do you know
6but I don't want to spend a bloody fortune
03yeah
03tablet PCs are a ripoff for what you get
6plus, those aren't flip screens
this game looks...AMAZING
02hey, Android games are awesome XD
03hence why I got mine for $150
06when i read this, i feel so damn spoiled lol
03on a firesale
03as that's actually a fair price for a 32GB
cowvarkian : How do I know what ?
Thank you Shizuka. <3
Yes you can, you can have good with neutral.
ACS13123: it is pretty fun
6spoiled?
How do you know that we cant have good without bad alister
06"dad, which iPad should i get?" "oh, ill pick one, and pay the 3G Pre-Paid costs"
Alister: thats a wrong statement you cant have good without worse but yet worse can stil be amazing O.o
06yea, kindof
13tbh i'm not terribly fond of it, but people like it~
13moment
06but doesnt mean i dont work for my stuff >>
D: Then why play it, Shizuka?
03more like
Because people like it? :$
03"Which iPad should I Get?" "There's a choice?"
to please the crowd Vordox
/me hides
13makes for good tv
Play something else entertaining? I'm pretty sure people mostly enjoy the music rather then the game. =3
RankWinner foxinator cowvarkian : There will always be someone who will corrupt the the creation or goal wich was pure
03or to quote Henry Ford, "any color, so long as it's black"
Wendy's is awesome :D
03:P
02LOL
6but why would you even get an iPad
We had a goal...?
6like, I hate sounding like drf, but it's a serious question.
Well, obviously. Im just saying, how do you know.
Alister: true true
06Handy as hell for me
6how though
03it's what I call "blinded by the leet"
02Android or gtfo
Because, you dont know.
Nobody knows anything
06GL
03granted I'm guilty of that sometimes XD
06dont get me started on that hypercritism :P
6I only agree on the hatred of apple because I know firsthand what it's like to have to pay fortunes and then fortunes more
6for something I coulda gotten way cheaper
03like the wi-fi randomly doesn't work
An Audiosurf where you ACTUALLY play the notes ? BLASPHEMY !
but hypocrisy seems to be so popular nowadays!
6several times over
06jailbreak and CustomOS much?
Holy shit the weather changed fast!
03but that's to be expected of a third-party build :/
06ikr Espy?
I want Audioserf
03pssh, with my tablet it's not even jailbreak
nvm it started to suck again
03it's just "put the tablet in developer mode, done"
:|
06psssh, i dont give a shizz
02XD
:)
>.>
:S
:$
hey, that was him, not me o.o
Am I the only one who wants a game audioserf?
:P
yes
i have cabrana
02I'd like to get one of those Toshiba Tablets
okay, thank you biased source, Alister
02with Android
i would like Audiosurf
hm...epilepsy is magic
ikr
cowvarkian : I was joking.
I know
what song is this
03what's special about Toshiba?
03hi'
6with the economy, I'd totally "give a shizz"
03exactly why I only bought a tablet because it was a firesal
03e
6granted, I'm in a horrible position with money right now, the CSU system is crashing quickly
03and I never even use the stupid thing
I HAVE THE POWER!!!!
06thats why i feel spoiled
of sound?
06because i CAN "give no shizz"
02Toshiba's tablets are more powerful than a lot of other brands including apple
wow that bollet hell game...
03is it better than the Asus one?
bullet**
hey xmasskills hows your day been
02dunno
It's like an 80's cheesy song but with Modern Techno and Decent Rock
>_>
6I might try to get an LE1600....Asus is ridiculously expensive
02I'll have to do more research
whats your point alister
6LEs are discontinued though
that all sounds awesome
6they're cheap, but yeah
I'm saying it's good
in the overused sense
-_-
03oh, those old ones
6yeah
03I know HP made a bunch of good tablets back then
You were presuming I said it sucked
6winXP and such
03with swivel keyboards
03I want one of those
03yeah
mehbeh
Alister: Heard of Running in the 90s?
03XP Tablet Edition is fun
03XD

Vordox : yes
03I've never owned one myself but a friend had it, fun stuff
Same Anime, I think
Well Alister, it seems you have made the reputation of being a critic of some sort
13the problem with there being a big storm this morning, and me leaving the window open, is everything's all humid
13my timing is off on twitching back and forth...
Vordox It's from an Anime ?
D:
what anime ?
sure
that sucks
<.< Don't frizzle the Computer, Shizuka
03http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA0DM0821391 <- LOL I'd totally get that if it weren't so expensive
13oh don't worry
I will
13she's already way frizzled
13she'll get over it
D:
oh my
hey does anyone know a good soundtrack to create this tense of not knowing waths gona follow like in those detective movies?
HEY! You there! BRONYSTATE1
its a female?
Well if you says so. =/
6hmm, the LE1600 isn't convertable O_o
6I thought it was lol
13you should hear the system fans right now...
6dunno which one my friend has, but it's perfect

Shizuka: are you able to do the Me Gusta song?
6depends on your uses

6ok

WoodKid Iron Sounds AWESOME to do AudioSurf on? :D
imma go play TF2 to this
6but I used it
back to the vacuum with you
03of course not, but that's why you use eBay
6eBay

who's broadcasting ?
cowvarkian: it does in your IMAGINATION where anything is possible
>.>
6yeah I'm probably gonna get it used

humbug
Vordox i play it on audiosurf every now and then
lol
Moo
It's an awesome song, and might be good for this, Don't you agree Shizuka? :D
ninja and clean finish
pretty cool
13that was of course the song for my outro vid
6I just don't remember what model my friend has aervfgjhbkjyfxtdgf
freeze?
03brb shower
Oh, what do you have in mind then now, Shizu? =3

wub wub wub wub wub wub
Vordox: the song can only be so long
02how's that?
Hehe, don't ruin the fun, dedxmasskills =3
so, its probably japanese
6oh you know what
00,03So, is this game about riding on soundwaves?
6I was about to say his might be a toshiba
6and that looks like it haha
yes
moo
02XD
02it's 1-86GHZ which is really powerful for a tablet
Scoot-Scootaloo: no its about getting the high scores while listening to kick ass music
fuck yeah
Scoot-Scootaloo it generates a road by analyzing the track and you ride on it and collect points
/me throws triple h into the chat
No idea Scoot, I'm just listening to the music rather then the gameplay. I don't see the fun of "seeing" it since it's very very hard to view.
it is Vordox ?
02I just wish there were more specs
It's just...riding the song...That's it? D:
how is that hard to view though
sounds easy to me
6thats called google
It's like watching Nascar = Round and round and round.
6like i'm doing
Vordox and collecting ponits. yes ^^
00,03This music... its so... mesmorizing...
Indeed Scoot.
I think there should be nascar to the death matches
Well points or not, remove those and what do you have? Avoiding obstacles? :P
Vordox yea i guess it can be like that but its pretty fun too
^
hey guys, in Ticket Master at the end, how come all the tickets are levitating above everypony?
You ride alongside a Rhytm based track, avoid Grey and Crash Red. That's it.
FAIled
instead of just driving around in circles, they could shoot out eatchothers tires and try to kill the opponents...
so close
02so it has a stylus
but thats for the future
in a dystopia
and whatnot
Vordox: not true there are more game modes than just this
But WHY is it fun watching it?
like what dedxmasskills
like eraser, pusher, dual
thanks CrimsonPhoenix what do you do in those ones
alexxm what phoenix said

Cowvarkian: Don't visit a therapeut or a Psychologist. :P

I wont, thanks Vordox
I have to say
We, well, not me, but I'm somewhat of a in between, we analyze EVERYTHING. ><

CrimsonPhoenix: yea i kinda like vegas more than mono
Nah Cow. I'm a Game Designer.
vega is fun
i can listen to the music without putting any real thought into matching colors
I enjoy Eraser
ah, ok Vordox
im a 15 year old kid who over analyzes random bullshit
CrimsonPhoenix: yea that one is pretty fun
I analyze WHY games are fun for SOME people, or all. Then Go into the Cornerstones of the game to find out why, which causes to the question if WHY the designer put those into the blocks.
dat renard X3
or Mayhem
ah, ok Vordox
...same thing
bonjour
Salut
Also handling graphics, music, sounds, Effects, Interface, Basegrounds, USP and Mechanics... ._. EVERYTHING

6wonderful
Shure blame it on your wrist Shizuka
6but I was expecting as much
13plus humidity and cold and blah blah blah let's get rocked
03I bought this 35mm of a Pokémon trailer, I wanna make some 4k scans :P
ok
Train your wrist and hand some more. :P
00,03I thought your dodging skills were MLG Pro :3

dude totally
bro
Vordox: if ya know what i mean
<.< No dexmasskills. I don't know
:D
02donno, every place I used went under and was local :x
I have a feeling this was parodied by weird al
03did they do movie films though or just pictures?
03the other thing with movie film is it has the audio on the side of the images
02I think they did both
03my regular scanner isn't going to know how to handle that
03hm
dont know why, just feels like it could be >_>
03because I'd totally mail this to some place that can do it for me
03I want 4k Pokémon footage, even if it's only 2 mins long :P
02XD

6probably
Wrek playing?
6wouldn't be hard to reinstall would it?
you're all nuts... alcohol is your friend, let it take control... nothing could possibly go wrong

twilight_sprinkle: pfft... then you dont know how to handle it...
anything in moderation is amazing
mmm, moderate amounts of toxins, delicious
ikr

02well, the people who refurbished probably knew what they were doing
Midnight_Tempest: i dont consume anything that would affect my thinking
02it*
^
lol dat dancing spaceship
Accept Caffiene
02even though windows xp probably would run a little better XD
dat addictive
03no but I mean
03XP may not have drivers for that model
eh i dont drink coffee either
13XP FTW
02ah
i just eat sweets or drink cola
morning.
03but if it had it before refurbishing
03then prolly
if i need energy i mean
twilight_sprinkle: you know... there is such a thing as giving yourself a limit... it just up to you to make sure you stick to that limit
and hai XAX
my face when the algorithm im looking at
02yeah, it did. It's from 2007 I think
I dont really like caffeine... and I dont like sweets, but I eat them too often...
13they say my name here

03inb4 came with Vista
03like my laptop did >_>
Shizuka no we didnt say your name

^
http://www.myfacewhen.com/10/
02was $1600 at the time, which is why it's so powerful
Shizuka blah blah blah something nonsense bullshit
03let me rephrase that for you
02now it's $300 XD
03"It's so powerful, which is why it was $1600 at the time"
03:P
all work and no play makes Shizuka something something...
go crazy?
yeah
02same thing either way :P

no
maybe
yes?

02but really, 2.0GHz tablets in 2007? That proves how awesome Toshiba is :P
if i had some money i would buy myself some more whiskey...
BEEEER
/me demands beer
alcohol may be a depressant, but god damnit it makes me feel good
IS GOOD
Alcohol is not the awnser. But if you drink enough you will forget the question.
03heh
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER
My older brother would approve of this song...
yup
I probably wont drink alcohol, because I dont wanna spend money on something that I dont need...
Kipkat07_Mare: lol
twilight_sprinkle: yep :D
So much wrong with the people who write this music.
MOAR
Kipkat07_Mare: I gotta remember that lol

hmmm should i buy skyrim..?
that ending is so sudden
rule 23
yes F22skyhunter
13it's too popular though
buy skyrim
13i'm only on friend board .-.
Suddenly... I need to pirate something...
i'm on steam store now thinking
damn i wish my pc could handle skyrim
I play games no one has heard of :3
One of my friends gave me his steam account so I could play Skyrim while hes gone for the next year or something. But he didn't tell me the password :'(
13oh yeah i haven't done my new acquisitions yet~
Cobellanez: you cant contact him?
Nope
who iss excited for the lottery during BMN?
I've never known his phone number
Not really
why don't you ask him if he's still in your country Cobellanez
f22kyhunter
I just know hes SOMEWHERE stumping trees in Texas
do you have he's email Cobellanez
His computer was the only way I had of contacting him, but he didn't take it with him.
Cobellanez: go to texas and find him! itll be a fascinating story about two people, a game, and a missing password
I'd buy a 3DS XL.
:>
02same
lol
and than you can make a film out of it
Yeah I'll just check every forest in Texas
it'll be an epic movie
14me too
everythings bigger in Texas
02I'd probably per-order it XD
ending scene: I lied, i never had a Skyrim acc
02pre*
14but I'm fine with my 3DS for now x3
they should be able to improve the battery and 3D effects too
14and I'm afraid that DS mode with a 3DS XL = awful
14o.o
Dat ending scene
02yeah
god you know what movie i havent seen in a while?
how..how could you
what a twist twilight_sprinkle
02@HML
y-you lied
i now pronounce you chuck and larry
ekips: its the perfect base for the sequel: Revenge of the gamer!
/me has never heard of such a film.
wow my audiosurf is lagging like a biotch
02[13:45] <Viri> and I'm afraid that DS mode with a 3DS XL = awful <-- na, they would probably improve it over the 3DS
mine too dedxmasskills
My audiosurf lags a lot if I don't turn the stream off
pfft
haven't benn able to play in months now
it has adam sandler in it
I doubt it.
theres never before been a movie with both zombies and robots before
13you guys see that loop ahead o.O
because
yesh
same resolution
02oh yeah
it'll be stretched out more though
is that the one where he pretends to be gay Clover
yay loop!
02true
they should really fix up DS mode though c.c
alexxm yes it is
no he pretends to be bi
02they could make it better then it is
This song makes me want to go play Trackmania
Aww, twas not a loop

Dat loop de loop
that loop was a spy
the wubs they burn
/me watching Two Best Friends Play Resident Evil 4

RE4 is an awesome game
/me pours a vat of wubs onto Clover
It is
noooooooooooooooo
sorry Clover
Currently playing through Seperate Ways
/me wubs for Clover
She cleans them with......wubs
Sucks ass due to not being able to do shit with your guns

02it would be awesome if they let you download DS games in the e-shop (won't happen)
Spikey and blue?
Clover its funny wubs burn you and hugs burn me
/me hugs dedxmasskills
13and the reason i am the only person in the world to play that song
13is because it was almost impossible to find
my hair looks like that pony at the hospital who was bald.
huh
*hug dedxmasskills
/me claps
ARG the hug it BURNS!!!!!!!
Yay Shizuka is first, congratulations :3
13very very good track, first time running it on audiosurf
That bald pony had his funeral in the next episode

06Hyper

Why aren't you playing on elite?
that means ur number 1?!
14EC?
06i almost reached 10.000 games
0610K games
13elite takes waaay more reflexes
So?
13i like to be able to relax
quality over quantity
OK
you did it again ghostxmas
and I can only assume EC is like
exactly
rated e for everyone or something
or early childhood silly me
it should be obvious
I enjoy the challenge of Elite
06im not a newb at all, but Experienced and more pure thinking then you
14what's EC o.O
never even seen that rating used
did what Clover
02early childhood
*than
10,000 cheap/app games, or lame sequel shooters
or something
yum yum, rum rum...
ded chat is dead
I've seen it
EC is 6+
Can't decide between Battlefield 3 or SSX
...yep
06nope
or something
14what's EC o.O
Battlefield
SSX
Battlefield
it's like an age rating. "Early childhood"
SSX
02EC is 3+
instead of talking you say you did something
06Consoles from original to Emulators, PC Games to the max, and more and more :P
02not 6+
YO 'SUP
Same difference
14ohh
ohai WindWhistler
and dismissing games just because of their rating makes me want to go find the I PLAY HARDCORE MATURE GAMES FOR MATURE GAMERS LIKE ME image macro
how about you choice neither and get a game that doesnt suck?
Clover oh you mean when i do the italics
yes
I don't know. I want to play battlefiled because it has been awhile but SSX has a new DLC
Lighty plays a ton of mature games too ;>
/me laughs at Clover
SUP WindWhistler
14I don't really follow ESRB/PEGI ratings
14they are a joke
Yeah
im sorry but i talk on other chat sites
1418+ in Italy
14wut
02Espeon, EC is only used for learn to read games and such
Alcoholic_Tempest: You had WAY to much to drink if you think Battlefield 3 sucks.
Some games dont' deserve to be T
0h god its colgate related
(Knocking down ratings that is)
06the netherlands did this:
6http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/pokmon-how-to-hatch-an-egg.jpg
02hence my joke
Same with movies
they're recommendations not like
everyone KEEP THAT A SECRET FROM FLARECHASER
limits/rules
*cough*Emulators > everything *cough*
anyway
Kipkat07_Mare: not at all, the game is horrendous... it should be dumbed down for people that only want to play casually
06"oh, a game Advises 16+, EVERYONE WHO IS NOT SIXTEEN CANT BUY IT"
14Espeon, I can understand a difference like 2-3 years
Alcohp;ic_Tempest: You can diss on battlefeild all you want but SSX does not suck
yes i agree
14but from E to 18? o.O
14what kind of recommendation is that? xDD
i mean every game that involves gambling is basically rated 18+ by default
Shamroc: wat that colgate is cheating on him
SSX is a snowboarding game right?
even if it's just virtual dosh in a poker game
I dont like Battlefield 3. I loved all the previous Battlefields
yeah
both suck get skyrim
mfw I have no face
Alcoholic_Tempest: lol I dont really care about battlefield. I just say that because I love the jets and the maps
Clover: skyrim is lame compared to fallout
*gasp*
Bronysith: Fallout is best game
and the lazy solution nowadays seems to be
lol They are pretty much the same in my book
"oh it's an action game and it's online? 18+!"
i agree fallout has a much better story a backround
ITC: Opinions stated as fact.
02Also, oblivion is rated M and was previously rated T. Why? Because some hacker figured out how to make everyone topless >.>
or "Experience might change during online play!!"
skyrim is pretty boring after the first playthrough... it got boring really fast
I mean what is really the difference besides setting weapons and story?
6LOL
6that one always made me laugh
lmao that's p. dumb
dragons
lol
02yeah
magic
fallout has a radiation level
it gets too easy too fast in skyrim but its good when it lasts
reminds me of the sa "hot coffee" thing just not as stupid and overblown in the gaming media
Indeed
fallout actually gives you a different story to follow if you go good/evil/neutral... skyrim doesnt
02^
02Lol.
Now you know what I hate in Skyrim? Ward spells....
0,5Vin Deisel once made a go kart that ran off of the hopes and dreams of orphans
lolLC
bacon lord!
0,5It goes fast.
fallout has a more dark feel to it
if the crafting and enchantment system werent so overpowered skyrim would be much harder
Hey Everyone.
LordCelestia: I c wut u did ther
14I don't really care about how much a game can be violent/non violent though
~
06me neither
06even though im not 18
14except Madworld. That was a very fun experiment xDD
06i PLAY all the games i can get
02<Viri> 14I don't really care about how much a game can be violent/non violent though <-
if a game is violent just to be violent / using violence and HARDCOREZZZ as a selling point whoever
How I love Friday nights
02In most games the clothing isn’t part of the models. So that’s no reason to give it that rating |D
02I just care if it is a good game lol
designed it should have their license to make games revoked
or their fingers removed
:J
14"oh, a very violent game? Let's try it. It's on the Wii, so it shouldn't be that violent"
i liked fallout before it came to the hands of bethesda
friday nights are boring... like all my nights...
Prolly the only thing that pulls me through the week
14after 5 minutes Iwas like "WTF IS THIS EVEN LEGAL"
14xDDD
02Which game Viri?
02xD
INB4 madworld wii
and changing rating due to something modders do
i would like to see another fallout in the style of the first 2...
makes every single game ever 18+
02CaLLing?
thats what im saying
02well, the person had to hack it to even do that
Saturday at 13:00 EST is the only thing that gets me through the week
Being a consolefag I've never played the first two
it wont happen though... no one seems to like top down tactical games much anymore...
Hi all :)
Though I do hear FO2 is badass
Hey That_Irish_Guy
know its just a rip off of the elder scrolls
Oh hai That_Irish_Guy
"oh no they model their characters naked so clothes aren't PAINTED on and someone removes them in ways that can't be done through normal gameplay"
14I'd rather to have all games rated 18+ instead of having them all censored though :/
:U
Hi That_Irish_Guy
lmao censored gaems
yes the irish are taking over
14Soul Silver and Heart Gold, for example
0218+ rating!!! >:@@@@@
:$
fallout 2 is awesome, and NV is almost as good... almost, but not quite
02says ESRB
/me runs
14sometimes 18+ isn't even enough
censored?
nv is too easy
o-o
14Dementium was censored in europe
Still it all comes down to one thing... does it kill time fast enough?
14why? Because it was on DS
14<w<
http://i.imgur.com/5a2Wj.jpg
hi That_Irish_Guy yea it rymes big whoop wanna fight about it

RX-78-SweetieBot: related post with something posted yesterday
hello cowvarkian
hey Teh
And that's not trolling, you'd be thrown out of troll school and mocked by all the other crappy trolls for that kind of "troll"
02a lot of PC games have ratings
Hi CCCP
Wut?
one of the opinions was spelt wrong
NV is easy, yes... but i was so happy when they added the Hardcore mode... that made the game worthy in my eyes
even though you can cosplay...doesnt mean you should
14I'd just build a gaming PC if consoles weren't so longer-living than PC's graphics cards
lol
That was clearly the superior opinion HML
side by side of a fat yoko and a hot yoko
OmegaMetroidBrony: (\
because it was a special snowflake
lols
fighting and drinking are the irish elements of harmony
:p
06ye sGL they have
haha
SNES > all
Or NES > all
14^
06but atleast they are better imo
14SNES
Star Wars: Battlefront 2 is Demigod tier
Thats why the world loves us :$
TTGL yoko? Or Castlevania yoko?
sweet... im the irish element of drinking then
02SNES > All]
14NES is too choppy sometimes
06SNES was good
02heck, I've even seen Android games with ratings
02I agree
hmm
first
fun?
also fat ichigo: http://i.imgur.com/HvpUN.jpg
13moment
every game is prone to ratings as far as i know.
06too bad i know far better games then on SNES :u
ah
Good afternoon everypony!! :)
oooh... Battlefront 2 is fun, i love that game
wait there 4 elements of irish
that sounds painful
Heya RaveBrony
Star Wars: battlefront 2 is like one of the greatest game ever made
hey RaveBrony hows your day been
14I can't find a better platform than Super Mario World o.o </imho>
BattleField 1942 Ftw
allo allo eveyrpony
but to sum up my view, anyone viewing ratings as rules/laws and not guidelines should just keep their mouth shut and get out :3
/me waves to OmegaMetroidBrony and alexxm :$
drinking, fighting... swearing and... potatoes? 4 irish elements
02^
Drinking, fighting, luck and potatoes
Because the S/NES has no DLC, no loading times, no bad multiplayer, no disks, has backwords compatability with the GC/portable consoles, it never breaks, it never requires updates
14newer ones seem just too much...easy
MY day has been prertty good :)

14nah, I still play for fun
RaveBrony: yes its new
Without something/somebody making things difficult
:D
Oh mai, intermission? D:
13it's something i'm working on
Awesome!!
see yall latez
06trolls or no trolls, GAMES ARE ABOUT FUN, NOT DISCUSSION AND DEPATE LIKE HYPOCRITIC TROLLS, play for fun, not trolling
how come CCCP
Whoever introduced the "Kill/death ratio" to online shooters
I hope that person
cya ghostxmas
14I do like 0.5% of online gaming
Elements of trolling
To bad FlareCharser isnt here, i have something for him :P
alexxm: eh idk, it was just really boring
oh, reboot
Whoot...is...this?
Shizuka: Its very nice! Quite silly too :) I love it!
hey CCCP i have added a new chapter http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23903/The-Force-of-Friendship
even tho our gen are the ones who had came up with the age of the internet and trolling
last series?
alexxm how was your day?
I dunno, something not too cruel but rather unpleasant :D
Time for regular Shizuka stream, yay!
Goldeneye 007 N64 best shooter
hai Bronysith
:L>
good CCCP
and suddenly Reboot
Bronysith: oh cool! ill check it out
06whenever people aske me "whats ur K/D RATIO GAME GOD?!"
with little sound
Or 'better FPS' at least
there were probably trollers in the early 1900s
at the risk of creating some anger, i must say that the signature doesnt fit in for an intermission imo...
this one is a bit more light hearted CCCP
02TF2 is best shooter :3
06im like: LOOOOOOOOOL f*ck off
06Doom is :P
Bronysith: okay :3
alexxm: its just been basicially a massive face palm
06if everyone is fanboying on FPS
06Doom hould be your religion
TF2 is probably the best one I've played of FPS tbh.
Bye everypony
06without Doom NO FPS
Shane377: everything is a massive facehoof
06:P
Like Doom

cowvarkian: reboot it is the first half hour cgi show
Did somebody say pirate?
HNNNNG SO MUCH ANGER
Metroid Prime ftw

Hey there LadyCanary :P
As long as I am here for ShizuStream :3
not saying doom isn't good and fun bt
13>logging off
06but think of a worl
ww
14well, I think that people can do anything they want
06without Doom
13>relieves tension
06no FPS
Some other game would do it.
True stroy
06Call of Duty as sidescroller
Hi Shibakuzou_WallDives
story
RX-78-SweetieBot: Exhausted to say the least. And yourself?
twilight_sprinkle: my oc travels from star wars universe to equestria http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23903/The-Force-of-Friendship
14but bragging all the time about their scores = no.
13you boys~
It's just the natural progression
06^
Wolfenstien was one of the first FPS
14I know many people who do that
O.o
Imagine them inside BF3
06WOLFENSTEIN<3
:P
;DS
know what else relieves tension Shizuka
Bronysith: be wait i need to close ponies, i cant see anything
06i loved that game
grrr stupid limev, always cutting off on me >.<
06still do x3
02Wolfenstien is awesome
hi icybeauti
Doggie!
bragging about video games is in 95% of cases a sign of TIME TO TURN AROUND AND LEAVE
LadyCanary: just got finished cutting the grass so still sweating
06yea
Is this that show with the games? Hey CCCP
/me glomps Digitalis.
Shizuka: awesome food
06i once went in discussion with a bragger
06k/d ratio shizz
13enzo just changed icons again
/me huggles Alcoholic_Tempest xD
06i was cruel
06and too cruel
13again, it's important every time
Can somebody find me a good FPS game that isn't 100% based on gore and aimless shooting around/zombies
:>
14I didn't like Wolfenstein because it was a copy of a great SNES game called Super Noah's Ark 3D
/me runs
Ohwaittheydontexistdothey?
13last episode he changed icons to escape detection by the infected Guardians
i've spent plenty of facepalms arguing with people who think they are gods of gaming just because they play in the lower levels of competitive gaming
06trolled that guy so hard, he didnt come to school for atleast a week
06xD
seriously some of those people have the biggest egos
on the planet
14^
ty Shizuka for explaining stuff
how long after the first season is this
13we're halfway through season 3
oh lol
:p
14that's why I don't play online much
yes he does.
and that's coming from me who's far above thinking comp is NO FUN ALLOWED FOX ONLY etc.
14I love offline gaming x3
I am off to school. See ya'll later :D
lol Gavin
13and still debating whether to go on to season 4, cause that doesn't have a good ending..
Hey Viri
ah
What if the User started playing BF3??? They be done in 10 secs XD
14yes?
What to know my K/D ratio?
I think you should show it anyway Shizu
14o.o
*want
;P
14which game?
for whatever my opinion counts
14oh wait, it doesn't matter
Any game.
14cuz mine is bigger than yours
/me runs
downer endings are best.
Ahem, any FPS game
Would be nice to end the series
It is 0/0
Bronysith: i might read it later, atm a bit busy
So I'm better than all of you
End the series for what?
because there is no percentage for that
14lol
/me super sarcasm KFC bucket
14hipster %
Reboot never ended properly...
ok twilight_sprinkle and if you like it plz give it a thumbs up and leave a comment cause the more likes the more likely more people will read it
06i dun even know what hipster means
06SHOULD I CARE? LOLOLOLOL
06^
i keep expecting that pirate to say "snooping as usual i see" >.<
14but anyway
06typical "dont give a f*ck guy"
This is buck mazing http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WKCBn4l-uQ&feature=BFa&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA
14I'm registered to a website where you can record your games, gaming scores etc
no vid links during stream
14I think I'm the only user who put a "private" mode
theres a stream icybeauti
If only lighty has manners and never swore
Ah :/
Bronysith: ok
:D
retarded look at mah horse pepz!
"Money can't buy happiness, but it pays for internet, which is pretty much the same thing." - Derpy
14because I don't care what people think xD I have that just to look at how many games I still have to finish
Yay not posting scores online?
hipster - one who is 'hip', not mainstream, doing something/acting in a way not considered ordinary.
06SHUT THE F*CK HYPAH, YOU SONOFA BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP
06trololol~
14I admit it though, sometimes I don't play for fun
Hehe. Biscut.
besides having a really low KD ratio is more fun because then the ones with a high one will get more rump-roasted when you beat them
come here boy- shows ass
06i sometimes play in revenge
theres a stream?
frisket
14but if I want to finish a game then I will do my best
i cant watch to see silence ot the lambs tomorrow
Brisket.
06headshotting my dad in TF2 HNNGGGG

14the first COD for example
Bronysith: Have you seen it before?
13making me hungry..
14I like that game
*as
rx its probably fake
14but it's WAY too much bugged
06me too
14but I want to see the ending
LadyCanary: no but ive heard its good
theres no where near that many girls on the net
i actually like CoD but
14so I keep trying :3
You hear right. It's fantastic.
06snd CoD 2 was awesome too
13COD IS A FEESH
/me end trollface
02<%Espeon> i've spent plenty of facepalms arguing with people who think they are gods of gaming just because they play in the lower levels of competitive gaming <- Gotta love when people get SALTY
the community needs immense amounts of 4CHEMO
I have seen it before :3
high quality walls
02Can't wait for this years EVO

Alcoholic_Tempest: i know this great bbq joint that serves the best brisket

the funny thing is that low-"tier" comp players are usually elitist douches but the pros are usually cool dudes.
where be Bronysith
02^
cowvarkian: here in georgia
14is annoying sometimes, but it's a lot more realistic than "omg someone shot me...wait....wait...wait....ok I'm fine now"
ah
02True Story
02Unless you use Phoenix in UMvC3
limev... y u turn off on me...

idk why it does it >.<
Therefore, I can finally do stuffs with you lot.

O GOD
YOU KILLED ME, WHAT YOU DO IS CHEAP AND OP - Usual player, joke was self made.

05evening fellas
hey Wrek|Observiking
oh ello Wrek|Observiking
Eyup, Wrek|Observiking
hey cachi01 hows your day been
hello Wrek|Observiking
g'day Wrek|Observiking
Hi Wrek|Observiking.
/me glomps Wrek|Observiking
:D Wreky!!!!!!
the secret is to realize video games are video games
02when someone uses/does a clearly stablished OP thing/Character
hiya Wrek|Observiking
hello Wrek|Observiking ^^
Hello there, everypon.
alexxm: AWESOME THX :)
Hi Wrek|Observiking
it's a secret art but it's possible through intense soul-searching
hey Wrek|Observiking hows your day been
*everypony
hi Wrek|Observiking!!
14lol
05LadyCanary!!
Oh hi Wrek|Observiking !!!
I'd just forgotten how much of a dick Enzo was during mid S3
and of course mostly because communities sure love collectively banning things that are demanding to learn to adapt too
/me huggles Wrek
LadyCanary..ello!
hey DrLyrus hows your day been
14Espeon
but if something literally is the only viable option then it should be gotten rid of
/me huggles back~
Good, good.
hiya DrLyrus
Hiya Shamroc
14people need to hate
of course
14being a gaming community = reason to hate people
05its been terrable
14*in a
05i*
14most of times at least
why bad Wrek|Observiking
14:P
05but ive managed
02^
how come Wrek|Observiking
why?
perfect example: people complain CoD needs to change, black ops 2 trailer shows future warfare, "WHY ARE YOU CHANGING THINGS IT'S GOOD AS IT IS"
05right now i jsut want to relax some before i gotta sleep
http://derpy.me/qWQbK
05due to school
stuff like this almost makes one wish for a nuclear winter
hey LadyCanary hows your day been
06we all have out ups and downs
myspace?
13it's reboot wrek~<3
Hang in there Wrek. <3
but then again using the cod community as an example is pretty trollish in itself
14I find console wars very stupid
14and I said "wars"
14not "polite discussions"
console wars are literally for
alexxm: Exhausting to say the least. Hope your day is goin well.
people that should be forced to never go on the internet again
never
again
g2g guys bye!!
02http://www.troll.me/images/one-does-not-simply/one-does-not-simply-stop-a-game-from-being-pirated.jpg
it is how come your days been exhausting LadyCanary
bye cachi01
Bye cachi01
This week was exhausting. We had a holocuast survivor come in today.
Cya cachi01
wow thats fucked up
cya cachi01
She's still being held in a rapecellar
14who cares about what's the best console, I still play AOE lol
13there's a stealthy joke here
13one of the battleships is the SS Cameron
02I just buy every console :'D
14and if I cared a lot for graphics, I'd buy a PC and a copy of Crysis 2
if one enjoys whatever they are using why would they care what others enjoy
I saw that...
james cameron?
Oh HA! I get it
har har.
13this is 1997, James Cameron's Titanic was expected to fail
14but graphics =/= quality
S3 was pisstons of references, duh
that is horrific
:3
13because so much had been spent on it
05nice wings and mane
alexxm: Lots of projects, stress, waking up early.
of course a lot of the time it's just people trying to rationalize their purchase by putting down what others pick
even though it was one of the highest grossing of all time...
Well looks who's laughing now eh?
05think the OC's coat color is a bit dark though
which is equally sad and hilarious
rape
02^
06but this is my opinion: "i DO care about others opinions, but force myself to be as pure minded as ever to rate a game and tell about it in HONESTY, if needed, ill flip the bird to those who just CANT think forthemselves, which prooves they are weak/unpure minded, Gaming is about fun, NOT being an arse about the fact someone plays Halo, and not Cod, some dont like FPS, thats fine, others HATE SNES too! opinions, opinions, opini
"its in our genes" weak-will is not genetic, stop blaming others for your weakness
Wrek well that is my fav. type of blue :P
trident of powah
14conclusion of all this discussion
14people are dumb
14:D
Only 3?
14really, my cousin is 10 and plays Fifa 12 online
nope
06conclusion2: if they start being dumb
14sometimes he gets hate messages
4
06dont give a f*ck
06:D
05jsut mah opinion man
too many people stress that opinions are opinions and then when their opinion is challenged
05:3
02Well, Albert E. said that Human stupity is infinite
14they are in english, so he doesn't understand
02therefore I agree
HES DUKE NUKEM
And i respect you for that :P
13silly filly you can't push up goggles that are glued to your face
06i agree too Ray
05btwe
06fact is
a web surfer... seriously
Balls of STEEL
but I'm embarassed when he asks "HEY VIRI WHAT'S AN <censored>****?"
05think you'll like this one
06some people are SOOOOO stupid
dat Motorola.
...Is that duke NUkem?
13okay I don't normally care about people swearing and such, buuuut there's a swear script on this chat for a reason -w-
14D:
That_Irish_Guy: i thought you were That_British_Guy?
yeah lol
14I censored that o.o
14...oh
more like his cousin, toothpick nukem
wtf is this?
its is duke nukem was a character on jersey shore...
14I swear I wasn't meaning that
14xD
Wrek you silly filly :P
Oh man, JUST as I was about to restart my computer
02LOL
and all I can say is that when stupidity becomes a valid energy source the gaming community better watch out
13I was talking to Lighty LOL
02Anyway
02Practically everything in the gaming world is opinions. And there’s nothing wrong with people expressing those opinions if they want.
02*le poof.
Elephant: Reboot
13why is it so difficult to make a point without swearing
13just sayin'
ANGER
13>>
06sowwy AE
13you know... see *now* matrix has a problem with ray
02I feel the urge to play Taiko
02:>

/me mega-hugs AE
13but in the prison... why so suddenly mad at him
that means that I agree
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3629/
/me noms AE's floof
02:3
06and i know ^^;, sometimes by swearing, others people minds get that certain "click"
13FIRE AT WILL! (who's will)
/me gives Ray a drumstick?
Poor Will
06thats what ive intended :P

FFG-39....
the Cameron is going down!
05nice to see the texture work gettign better by the episode in reboot<3
hang on, '09, thats ages ago
...those battleships look cool... but otherwise they fail pretty hard if military tech cant bring down a simple pirate ship
14I don't like swearing. I don't mind people when do in general, but it annoys me when people insult while gaming :|
it doesn't even look armored, dammit
mhmm
13I only really swear around other people when I'm being completely serious about something, or if I'm really pissed off about something xD
NAD HAS A SAIL
14some joke is fine, but people exagerate sometimes
and still no scratch
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2109/ BronyState in a nutshell :P
i think they need more sails..
Well, maybe this isn't a simple pirate ship
thats what makes it particularly bad
13it's a pirate bay ship
/me doesnt like to brag, but is infact, too damn active with his mind, too much time to think means too much things to discover, like for instance, how the human mind actually works
mhmm
You can never have enough cubbies
14also
chubbies*
02unless you consider darn and crap to be swearing, I never swear
14if you swear too much, a purple dragon will appear
why is enzo being such a jackass
14:D
jealousy
05because aliens
male dominance
He's worried that Ray is stealing AndrAIa's heart.
06dundundun
because racecar?
13I don't consider "damn" to be a swear, at least it's not considered as one in the UK LOL
lol
nice Shizuka nice
13behold! the net!
02I don't

14that was so hilarious

a sheild in the exact form of the building... impressive considering it wasnt there when they set it up
waaait... that's not a voyager gold disk
hi
where did that one come from?
TheSpitFire
13it's the alien disk they found last season
13the symbols correspond to the alien sites they've found so far
wait, wasnt prime dead?
13Swearing can be great for creating humorous or writing funny articles, but not everyone can pull it off xD
thank you
so... one is alien and the other is from the voyager probe?
13and now we know that using it, megs can control their toys
RainbowcrashNBurn: got reprinted onto a blank

13*humour
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4486/ O____O???
06like teachers
13you can't kill off the optimus silly <3
13cracked.com is a great example :P
o-o
Well, I'll be back in a while
06teachers swearing IN MY SCHOOL = lotsa laughing
02o-o
optimus will never die
/me just finished some damn good noms.
Not for long, anyway
Oh yay
OMG.... ITS PINKIES BIRTHDAY TODAY!
kinda reminds me of a zerg hive
Thanks to the japanese series Optimus dies all the time.
but thats the japanese
they kill all their characters
dat Tomino.
If you've seen transformers 3, you'd know.
02the only times I'll think jokes that are funny is when it's a swear word pun
13and the characters they don't kill, they break
optimus is kenny's cousin from idaho
a Tomino-written Transformers...
Optimus is the Star Scream of the Autobots
They kill optimus about five times just to bring him back in a new body stronger than before.
He had his arm cut off and he gave 0.00 reoccuring fucks
...that makes me smile.
02and stuff like that
Id be happy with a new Tomino written anything.
14hi LL :3
^
12hai Viri
14how are you?
That_Irish_Guy: lol :P
12tiredish, yous?

13BLOW IT
Uh oh! Megatrons is going Super Saiyan?!
Shizuka: i'm still a little confused about these disks. is one of them alien and the other from the voyager probe?
I hate Tattle tales.
ughh i have to go again :|
13yes
Bai CCCP
okay then
12hai Ran :3
http://fav.me/d3khkb5
later CCCP.
13apparently after beast wars just about every transformers iteration had a golden disk macguffin
13just shows how good mainframe's writers were
thats cause beastwars became canon to the series
14same ^^; I think I'll go to sleep soon
13well it's canon within G1's timeline, ish
/me hugs Ran :D
13there's like two other continuity lines according to wiki
Two? theres alot
more than that
o;
more convoluted, Transformers of Zelda?
hai all :3
Transformers continuity is quite a mess.
AJ????
Transformers.
13versions of transofmrers ja, but in terms of which series inhabit which timelines, there's only a handful of timelines
the scorpion is a friggn texan
someone ship him with aj
gosh darn texans

It looks like Jabba the Hut and Lord Guru had a baby and it ate a power ring.
14*many
that, rattrap
Theres G1 cartoon, G1 comics, Japanese post G1 continuity, beastwars 2/neo, generations, armada-energon-cybertron cartoon, armada-energon-cybertron comics, bayverse, and the new aligned continuity
Derpy was in G1
and Animated
nothing can possibly go wrong now... <_< >_>
Ikr?
"most important" > sends the wasp
megatron is just BEGGING for problems
Dark_Horst: o god i hate a dream i was stung by tracker jackers
had Dark_Horst
Here is G1 derpy. And carrot top is in the backround. http://bronies.memebase.com/?s=G1+Derpy
by wut?
yet again makes me think of the people at my school that went "lol gay childish game" (direct quote) when seeing something tf2-related on my screen.
bonus points if you guess that they only play call of duty, because then you're right
02LOL
06i hear that alot too
Dark_Horst: tracker jackers. they are from the book THE HUNGER GAMES and they were bio enhanced wasps that made you freak the fuck out when you get stung
OKAY i guess people blowing to pieces and being on fire is "childish" because it's cartoony
06"what is your fav. game Kevin?"
...
Should I get in on the hunger games or not?
06oh, cant tell, played too many..letts see.....max pay-
aha
06no Cod? NOOOOB
Give it a chance
icybeauti: the book yes. the movie FUCK NO
well... was it a pleasent dream?
if someone said "noob" in real life I
06thats the moment i realize my previous class was full of mormons
Transwarp? Borg technology?
can't guarantee I wouldn't go HULK SMASH
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/608/ All the bronys in chat in a nutshell :P

Honestly the book is a pain the ass to goet form me
ty That_Irish_Guy
06i would punch em IN THE MOUTH
06:x
*get
/me glomps That_Irish_Guy
Bronysith: But my friend said that all the local libraries don't have the books since they're all taken out. And the waiting list is like 100 people.
Bronysith: that sounds like fun, actually
13WAIT! the aliens already know about cybertron... remember before the moon sploded, they scanned airazor and muttered "cybertron"
at least it's not as dumb of a word as "scrub"
Dark_Horst: it wasnt. everything was a hallucination
13they already know where these guys are from
icybeauti: just go watch Battle Royal instead
06yea
Shame I'm not in that group
especially as 95% of the people using it uses it when they are actually the scrub
06someone went like this:
06-look away-
Oh wait... I am :3
the aliens probably made the first cybertronians
13I call people noobs IRL, in a jokey way of course :'3
06Babysheepd*ck
06-look again-
06i was like
06LOLwaht?
RX-78-SweetieBot: I can look that up. I'm just doing metal reserch nowadays and writing.
06is that even a WORD? ._.
13i think in later series they did try to establish that link
06i litterly asked everyone, is it a word, cuz
dafuq
wait, silverbolt? when did he show up?
wait, so if they were sent BACK in time, if the aliens destroy cybertron, that'd create a time paradox wouldnt it?
13or at least the aliens being responsible for organic life
Alcoholic_Tempest: depending on continuity thats only either the Quintesons or Primus and Unicron
And AU that's something elseeee!
06xcactly
damn, i missed assloads of stuff, didnt i?
13also my mum just got home and I swear I felt the house shake
lol, Battle Royale.
13rhinox using dat infinite ammo
Dark_Horst: Not really.
RX-78-SweetieBot: true
13DID THE DOOR REALLY NEED TO BE CLOSED THAT LOUDLY
14o.o
Infinite ammo is best ammo
02AE, it's me :D

RX-78-SweetieBot: that is what I am saying :)
06who is taking pictures of my dads toilet paper again? >:/
thats a poor excuse.
06[22:53:51:551] <Angel_Umbreon> why is it so difficult to close a door gently? :<

In Aligned Continuity Megs and Optimus started out as allies. Megs as a Gladiator, Optimus as a librarian. Both wanted to end the terrible class system there was at the time.

recal the FFT is mostly noise above 24khz
03hence "in throY'
03*theory
do they come back RX-78-SweetieBot
also recall humans can't h ear above 20khz
03why did you even have me rip these at such insanely high sampling rates, then?
time for silverbolt x blackarachnia
alexxm: Kinda.
because 88khz is above 48khz,
03also ugh

http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4545/ Me in a nutshell :P
Random encounter
man so much drama..
ohai Rampage
headshot
if you want it to take up less space, you can rip to less khz and less bits
let the protoform X clopfics begin...
Oh how I love that Luna gif
his toy was fucking awesome.
what are they from again OmegaMetroidBrony
03eh
Black Arachnia forgot the most basic rule: Beware the random battles!
03I don;'t really care
03also LOL
Metroid Fusion
03Xanbreon, I think this HP computer ran so hot that the thermal paste basically melted onto the CPU
also, you can flac and upload to what.cd
03I just used a bunch of rubbing alcohol and it's not coming off
thanks OmegaMetroidBrony
03I mean, I got most of it
03but there are still marks
03from where the heat sink was
03I finally put that quad core in
Thats what thermal paste does
that spiders still in my kitchen
Surgical...strike...a la Valentine of Skullgirls?
It bakes into the cpu and fan
Protoform X must be the original SA-X
optimus looks different and has a surfboard? what happened in the few episodes i didn't watch? :D
To provide maximum heat exchange
Agh, my internet is just being so oppressive to me.:|
03well yeah but usually I can just use rubbing alcohol
03to wipe it off
Skullgirls is pissing me off right now...
03I got like 99% of it off the heatsink
Depends how old it is
Dat guitar
03but the old dual core has it caked on there
Crab Starscream is best starscream
03not that it matters, I'll just have it as a backup
Invi: second moon was a giant gun, optimus sacrificed himself to destroy it, was brought back from the matrix by rhinox as a transmetal
03since I doubt I could get much money for a 2.1GHz dual core
/me hugs TheRainbowDash
Probs not
intresting
alexxm: D'awwww, you!
03I gave away my laptop's dual core

03but I can't figure it out >_>
(nibbles on DerpStar's ear)
crap
Didnt you pay attention when you took it off? :P
rocket jump !
03yes, but that was like 20 mins ago
Also, the shockwave from the second moon exploding killed scorpinok and terrorsaur, and turned some of them into their new transmetal forms. Also messed with the pods in orbit, making fuzors like silverbolt and quickstrike
03and I have short term memory loss
03XD
d'awww
i have a stupid question, is that pony in the corner's name rosebud or rosey?

alexxm: more or less
Shizu: ;_;
tigatron died?

Its not Starscream, they tried to replicate his spark's indestrucitble nature
thats even more messed up RX-78-SweetieBot

Oh hai FluffyPaint
13woo~
It's been forever since I saw Beast Wars so I barely remember. All I recall is "transmutate" being a common term in the Beast Machines sequel.
Shizuka me too at the beginning, but in the end i was like Squidward at work ^^
Dat laugh
Bwoob
Hey, I know this show comes on every Friday
but
hey FlufflyPaint hows your day been
dat blah blah in background
This is the first time I've been here
dat chest hair
CK|Asleep: ignore Beast Machines. Completely.
13CK|Asleep: transmetal is, transmutate was a corrupted bot next ep
and Im not sure how it works
hi FluffyPaint
13i've pondered picking up beast machines
Bye Chrysa......Nevermind
could someone explain before it comes on tomorrow?
If only I had said that while I was still in school ...
mfw, this is the first time ever ive noticed the blah blah in the background
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
13looking at the screenshots on tf wiki it looks very inferior to beast wars though, despite same production company
....
No one can explain?
I only saw a bit of Beast Machines. It seemed kind of mean-spirited though, like if someone took the Beast Wars canon and was purposely trying to make a mess of it.
03wrong manual
13check out our FAQ FluffyPaint~
Shizuka: it was different writers and they weren't allowed to watch Beastwars to see how the characters developed.
bit late there LunaTheBeloved......

well today I learned what happens when you shut off a vehicle's engine while its in gear
You and Pinkie share a birthday? Lucky...
CCCP: ninja'd :P
RainbowcrashNBurn: awww u did it first!
I am 22 today
http://mlfw.info/f/1242/
gaybrony91 it's pinkies biethday today too? *le gasp*
/me hugs CCCP "its the thought that counts" :P
03I did that once
03nothing bad happened
no harm is done but the trans axel locks up for a moment
Since stream's over, I can safely post THIS to help my friend through her rough times.
RainbowcrashNBurn: :$
03yeah
http://ragecomics.memebase.com/page/2/
Eeyup, apparently
Woops wrong link.
Polydunami: who is your favorite pony???
I just did that in my truck
03of course I realized it right away like "LOL whoops" and turned the car back on, putting it into park
My birthday is this month, too! But not for a while ^_^
CCCP Right now, it's a three-way tie between Rarity, Twilight and Pinkie Pie
LadyCanary happy early b-day!!!!
LOLOLOL
Polydunami: hmmm.. :)
one sec
You're like, 21 days early, CCCP
https://www.change.org/petitions/help-reverse-deportation-order-on-ramon-cordoba-and-maria-isabel-viveros Here we are. Sign this to help a friend of mine.
CCCP don't congratulate too early. that causes bad luck
Polydunami http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4498/ ;)
LadyCanary: oh LOL still i wish u a happy birthday :)
I turned the key into the position to start the engine (where just one more position switches on the starter motor) and let the truck roll briefly
Are they illegal aliens or what?
yep
lel.
then I turned the key back into the lock position and put it in park
Invi: i dont belive in luck, cause if i did i would always get bad luck
then I was able to start the engine without any problem
Umm... If I were a pony, I would be o////o
But I prefer a human plot
I guess :$
03ugh
03so Xanbreon I was doing a Windows Experience Index benchmark with the quad core and the fan started spinning really loud to the point where I could hear it with my music on
I wonder what the animators were thinking when having Twilight flaunt her rump. "Nope, nobody is sick enough to pull that out of context." trollface.jpg
03is that bad?
12hmm
CCCP i believe in fortune => luck is fortune with good ending ^^
03BIOS recognizes it fine, though
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1565/ ITS ALL TRUE!!!!!!
12time to eat in the shower
People are heresy :D
suddenly, ValtheJean...
I like how plot actually sounds like a legitimate term
03LOL what
2,14 lies
12jk XD
Oh alright. Val isn't here guys.
WEI is crap
12finished eating, going to take a shower
I eat sandwiches in the bath
Hey Val
12brb
Val who?
Just some guy with a trident.
12wat
:D
But sure, the fan will spin up louder when the cpu is under load
2,14 howdy
03so that's not a bad thing per se?
Invi: everything is a chain reaction there is no fortune
hiya Val
Val is nothing but a machine who we ignore :P
03It never got loud with the dual core
12anyway, brb
03but that dual core was a crappy CPU
LL: Something I do when I'm in a rush :p
Greetings, ValtheJean
Invi: but u can belive what u want :D
2,14 well I am an omnipresent, amorphous being of energy
03soggy sandwiches, yum
03:P
Val!!!!!! :D
Invi: cause u might be right C:
Didn't Blade Runner teach you anything? Machines have feelings too :'(
Invi: cause im NEVER right
I'm not that stupid XD
I can't watch stream for another hour or so. I hope you won't be streaming stuff I want to see during that time.
ValtheJean http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3369/
02soggy drfs, yum
/me runs
03also
03http://valid.canardpc.com/show_oc.php?id=2355564
03Look legit?
Dual core had a FAR lower TDP
ValtheJean: if you are omnipresent, does that mean you know what i type before i press enter???
Oh my
09,01no stream going on guys?
Sure looks fine
03does TDP actually affect the *Fan* though?
2,14 indeed rainbowcrash
No :'(
03that's just power usage ain't it?
nope
Oh hey NewDCD Nothing on at the moment
09,01okay
Blade Runner... Now there's a movie lottery suggestion.
2,14 And DCD: check SRS
09,01I'm gonna test someth-
03lemme install PC Wizard on here
03and run prime95
03see what happens LOL
Higher power usage > more heat > hotter > fan spins moar to cool it down
test something?
CCCP lol you can't say that. Never say never.
09,01ah okay, nevermind
03true
:D DCD!!!!! So good to see you <#
Invi: why?
09,01just wanted to test something
03also gtfo Windows
hi NewDCD
BTW, what's the resolution of the stream? 640x480?
03I know it's not genuine >_>
Invi what? Cupcakes?
http://s1.hostingkartinok.com/uploads/images/2012/04/34c7deb2e20b8a39878384cde3f389f7.jpg

/me shoots himself
I had Greek food today
That_Irish_Guy: why? :O
02drf
CCCP my books about quantum physics showed me, that everything is possible, even if very very [...] very ulikely
*unlikely
02enter the serial! >:@
03well
03I *can* activate it 500 times
03but why waste one?
Lamb is delicious
Invi: so pinkie pie is real?
Invi....whats in this cupcake?????
02XD
03I'm just gonna wipe it out again anyway
03this was just a fast install so I can benchmark
03yes I know WEI is crap but it's better than nothing
CCCP possibly yes ^^
That_Irish_Guy: ?
03OK so
02ah
03according to PC Wizard, the cores are only at 48.5C
That_Irish_Guy a super laxative dose
03is that good?
Look whos back my children! :D
Flare is back :|
Oh hey FlareChaser ;)
Thats fine
...
03mainboard temp is at 65, LOL

FLARECHASER!
03mfw the video card is only at 45
hey FlareChaser hows your day been
alexxm: Good, good....
Hai FlareChaser
03but it's a relatively low-end NVIDIA, not a high end as it had to be low profile
I'm busy tonight
howdyx: nope lol

03and GTS520 was the best I could get :/
moin FlareChaser
hi FlareChaser
hi Pinkie_Kittie
.........:|
That_Irish_Guy: WHAT DID I DOOOO?!!!
Hey FlareChaser
That_Irish_Guy: 10/10 would cuddle.
03oh hey it cooled off by a few degrees
03now lemme run prime95 for like 15 mins
Hello Cobellanez !
I wants to cuddle ;3;
oh hello FlareChaser
I want to stop being so hot
03should I run it longer to let the thermal paste "settle" or whatever?
The sun shines right on my bed
Its annoying
Hello Shamroc....
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3271/
Humid too
i haven't eaten all day.
Silent then eat now
cant
I'd love to "hug an dash"
Doesnt matter
Silence of the ponies
03OK
has to do with the oven being broke.
Cobellanez: It's hot where you are right now?
It can cook in over time
03I know some people say you have to burn it in
03but I figured that was mostly hype
Hot and humid
Mainly because the sun is shining right on me
Meh, only really need to if you are going to srsly overclock it out of the gate
I see
03I also did the "put a small pea-size drop in the middle" approach rather than trying to spread it
So, what did you guys do yesterday? I wasnt here.
Otherwise, just let it cook over time
It's about fifty here in Vancouver
FlareChaser we exsisted
03OK wow um
I still didn't play l4d
wat
Errh, did you follow the instructions for your CPU
03running Prime95 here
/me has clouds looming over, waiting for the inevitable storm
03it's up to 70C
As you need to get the paste over the cores
03fas are at max
03*fans
50 = 10 celsius
Did you use the stock fan?
Our storm was last week
03yes
figuratively, not literally.
http://bit.ly/nGoPl0
03the fan is part of the case, not the heatsink
03it's a passive heatsink
night guys
And there in lies half your heat issues
LOL

I'm back!

http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1008/ This is why no human should insult us :D
You would have to look

Measure the clearance
03at what point should I worry about the CPU killing itself?
13the observiking

13i'm going to regret watching the mlp vector club group...
Spec sheet says 61deg is the max
13so many notifications...
03uh
03well it's far past that now
03it's now at 73.5
03should I turn it off?
Means its underclocking itself like crazy
I would stop running prime95
?
and find yourself better cooling
I did say that stock cooling most likely wouldnt do the job >__>
ohai everypony!
03yeah the fan slowed down almost immediately after killing prime95
Vector Club?
Hey valoreins
http://bit.ly/KtJGwl
03and it's down to 50C again
03well lemme shut it off, I'll show you what I'm talkinga bout with the cooling
03as it's some custom crap HP did
seems like the chat is quiet now
hey kids! :D

That should work
Dark92Enigma: lol :D
03I'd just leave that fan there *and* have active cooling?
Hey mods, why is tinychat being a butthole?
Sure
Try kicking Litwick.
Just line up the direction of air flow
If you have a side to side fan
03I think the one I found at the store has a vertical fan
Litwick wait for it. he auto disconnects after a while not chatting
That works

ErshBerstPerner...that slurring of words
ErshBerstPerner: whyare you talking like that? :D
good night everyone
03FMA says it looks like a core 775 mounting
I'd prefer it if they kicked the original Litwick so I can relog back in. I actually went without chatting for about an hour and I STILL didn't get autokick.

Polydunami how strange........it says 6 minutes in my computer
My bet is that the huge success of the finale did that...
Dark92Enigma: Is there no day counter?
13talking about the countdown timer?

Wait, RaveBrony is it your birthday today as well?

JRP2234[iPhone]: moo
Hello everypony.

Save your best weapons and ammo for the Deathclaws Wrek, they are UNGODLY STRONG
Cos its got a nice gui and is easy for endusers to setup

Who would buy Mount and Blade Napoleonic Wars if i created the Brony Regiment??
and crapbuntu
ZappyTheUnicorn: WHOA

03well as long as it's not overheating
Thats under a 125W load
aka 100% cpu
03as in, 100%?
but sumi has a sexy voice too o.o
03yeah
So Bronies made the news again
I don't think I've heard supi but Sumi's is pretty sexy
Hai again LL
I hurd u lyke b0rk
Polydunami the netherlands
Well, by news I mean Pajamas Media
12x.o
And you don't have a sliver of a Dutch accent?
I dont guarantee is will love being under 100% load
OmegaMetroidBrony you missed SB doing the webcam stream?
Polydunami nope.
But that fan plus the case one should keep it cool enough
03OK
Wait....
Even when you speak Dutch?
how does a pony type? :D
Biglaw : no one thinks they do, but there's always a classification :p
SB does have a pretty sexy voice as well
Polydunami I do not speak dutch, I live in Canada
Gunthler: They get lessons from Pinkie Pie
Oh yeah
Armor in that collapsed building
I don't think there are anything bad in the Recommendations this time, so if you want to listen in, here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwcJorJp_Aw&feature=g-u-u
Polydunami I know maybe 3 words in dutch
Oh you already got it...
Monfang: No videos during the stream
^
Hi everypony
Monfang: No video inks during streaming
Oh ya, I didn't see that big flashing light that said there was a stream going on
Cos im fed up of DDos
looooooool
I know
I saw it
that reminds me... stream status should be stated for those not viewing it.
if this carries on ill get a cheapbox for your ZNC <censored> or kick you off
>__>
Rocket launcher!
Fallout 3 or New Vegas?
Most likerly the 1st
Right there in the topic
lol Deathclaws want some of Wrek's hugs :3
As rapidxen do cheap 128meg boxes, and the ips are per account so
ded
well, pretty sure it's dalnet
it's a xenomorph
'Stream Status: Live"
okay, thank you
ouch
This is actually a reasonable time to use VATS
super hug hurts
Monfang : you're looking at a different "topic"
Just ban dalnet tbh
Dat deathclaw :D
Shits not worth the effort
/topic
BTW AMR doesn't really do shit on the either :
I hope I get the B-movie
The Wizard is my pick
how about this, if you aren't watching the stream and you want to hear what was said about bronies, let me know and I'll PM you the link.
I will be
he only wants to hug you :(
when flame comes back up
-_-
dat glitch
cheap shot
:D
Invi, Deathclaw hugs are almost as unpleasant as Metroid hugs...
=_(\
giant*
That's how I kill death claws too!
Wrek that was cheep
sssssssssooooooooooooooo cheap
Good
OmegaMetroidBrony that's right but it's still sad :(
Listen, while they didn't have much GOOD to say about grown men liking a show intended for young girls (You can't deny that at the start it was indended for young girls) they do raise valid points about some people using the show as a way to excape reality.
It's killing him with hugs... I would only allow ponies to do such a thing
:P
Monfang Shhh... Don;t say that kind of stuff
....
and...
Wrek http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/732/
don't*
Monfang: everyone wants to escape reality
^
Monfang isn't every entertainment to escape reality?
Fuck Reality
me too
SWAG
OmegaMetroidBrony: I agree :D
Yes, but only momentarily. They raise poits about some people wanting to escape for good.
I don't blame them.
Depends on how they do it....
brb dinner time
The world would be 100000000000000X better without reality
Monfang: if i would get to live in ponyville, id like to escape for good
03stupid Micro Center
03let's try this again
Self inflicted = weak, accidental = okay I guess
03OK there
03"pay at the store", fun stuff
Escaping from reality should be a luxery enjoyed only after all your duties are completed.
03so they'll have it in 18 mins
03and of course it takes me an hour to get there
03so
03I shoudl go
na
Living it out till the end = Best way to go if you "Win" life
03not like they care if I take longer than 18 mins, just saying XD
haha..
lol that was a good joke Monfang
and the fact that you can only die of old age is really.....
I wish I had a magical wardrobe, like in the Chronicles of Narnia, that lead to Equestria :S
I myself don't want to leave.
Monfang: if you mean escaping mentally, then maybe. but if for real, then id go to ponyville anyday

Oh hai Fireheart
03oh, cool
09,01crummy res tho
gl&hf
05,15DCD is 1337 haxor
Hello Fireheart
03I called Hitachi and bugged them for like 10 mins
03to give me a tracking number
If I had a choice to stay or leave, I'd stay. I like some of the things this world offers. I can't play Guild Wars 2 or any of my favorite video games in Equestria.
03the RMA'd laptop drive will be here by tomorrow
Perk1
/me brb
03according to UPS
!
03so I'll have the scorpio black I bought AND that XD
I can't enjoy meat in Equestria. It talks back!
lol I'd sure miss eating meat in Equestria
03which is fine, my PS3 needs a bigger hard drive, 60GB is tiny
Monfang: video games over peace and friendship?:|
How peaceful is it really?
I think I'd only miss bacon and steak, but I would manage
What has happened in Ponyville ever sense Twilight showed up?
Semi-Relevant: http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-014
09,01TYPAN FROM PSP SCREENAN
I wouldnt care about meat if i had
the magikz
NewDCD dat typin is gud
Monfang: well it was more peaceful until they got a wider demographic to satisfy :P
brb
why do they need pigs?.....
Good point PinkieLovesMe but what if you didn't have... The Magikz?
:o
Then...
Idk
Monfang ponyville was saved from an ursa minor
and it has a hellgate with a 3 headed dog
Thers prob a way to make a plant taste like meat in equestria
lol
PinkieLovesMe or just use magicks
Monfang: when was the princess kidnapped
I'd learn that magikz
It's not all roses and rainbows.
Yes
Episode ONE, Twilight
Dat nuke
O_O Dat Launch
Wait....A NUKE!?
INCOMING TACITICAL NUKE!
Nuke Launch Detected!
Monfang: she was kidnnapped? i thought she just did nothing
Monfang you forgot the Changelings
Remember? "The Princess is MISSING!"
Monfang not sure if kidnapped or just hiding
Kaboom!
:O
Watch it Wrek...
Monfang: so?..
Changlings attacked Canterlot, not Equestria
Fireworks!
dat shroom
CODE BLACK! CODE BLACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*Not Ponyville
Watch it in all of it's glory...
Monfang: she came from nowgere at the end, shhe wasnt kidnapped
DEFCON1!
0_0
Monfang: she was just being useless
Now you should be experiancing and EMP effect shortly
Oh that's a nice suggestion. She ran.
lol
Monfang: well thats what she normally did
Some Faithful Student you are.
Looks like a futuristic Portal
Sad beeping?
Monfang: what did she do when discord showed up?
02Yay, 220bpm songs
So what did you nuke?????
02with nearly no effort
@twilight_sprinkle: So she was just cowering while mane6 did their job?
Monfang: nothing
Monfang she was trapped in a cocon if that counts...
Obstacles
First time heer!
So what does radiation do to you exactly in Fallout?
Put a sheild up around Canterlot thanks to Shining Armor
Howdy,yall.
Keels you
Oh hai RoxyPony_SWAG
Thus saving as many lives as possible
oh god this place
SirGanjalf: from a practical view, yes
Because you know Discord's attack harmed if not out right killed ponies.
Oh hey RoxyPony_SWAG Welcome to Bronystate ;)
xD :6_9
:o
Monfang: lol? shining armor did that, not her
Dear Santa, WHERE IS MY FUKIN PONIEZ
Shining Armor would need the extra magic to hold Discord back.
Oh look, it's "watch Wrek be eaten by Deathclaws" hour.
03oh jeez
Allo everypony.
03it is pouring HARD out there
SwaggyStarfield: Go to Youtube for ponies if not stay for the games and art
I'd say that was NOT BIG SURPRISE, but i don't find moon that interesting
Dear Santa, I've asked you for the last time, give me a dashie, or I will eat Rudolf
03I'm gonna be soaked before I even get to the car x.x
moin Meanwhile
Okay, fuck iris
Hey Meanwhile
Oh yeah
OmegaMetroidPony lol ik

Soz
/me afk
/me pours RoxyPony_SWAG a mug of cider. Newcomers' standard :)
09,01http://img710.imageshack.us/img710/8505/img20120503182644.jpg
Because there was no need forCelstia to help because she believed Cadence was there.
09,01SCIENCE
Also, wasn't he getting migranes due to the mind control spell?
http://img40.imageshack.us/img40/8393/img20120503182653.jpg
NewDCD: I am the jelliest of jellies right now because of that.
Monfang: so again, she did nothing
I take it my mIRC won't connect because it hates me then
Lol
She isn't perfect. But I think that is better than calling her a coward.
Sister gets beat updoes nothing
Are you calling Princess Celestia a coward?
oh NewDCD how? :'(
Monfang: i didnt
to the MOOOOOooooon
But you said she ran and did nothing.
Right?
I'm back. Did I miss anything important?
Oh yeah. Hey Meanwhile :)
Monfang: i said she was absent when the ep 1 stuff happened, not that she ran
ZappyTheUnicorn: You missed me
Twilight Sprinkle called Celestia a coward, Zappy
Celestia is gettin beat at every turn... so much for hundreds of years of wisdom
quiet
Hi SwaggyStarfield.
And I'm saying she was absent because Nightmare Moon had kidnapped her.
It wouldn't be a very interesting show if all that needed to happen was have Celly wave her horn.
Monfang: oh ok then you called jesus a prick.
ZappyTheUnicorn newDCD uses his PSP as PC-monitor for chat
What other reason was there for her to be absent?
Celestia has a Xanatos mind
... Mostly
Monfang: seriously, lying about what i did to others, who arent even a part of this?
Monfang: what the hell man
I see...
Princess Celestia eats cake again.
those little creepie thingies
I'm not lying
You said she ran away
Good to know that chat is having a stupid convo.
More Deathclaws to hug :3
Monfang: it was half-sarcastic, i meant she wasnt there
Seriously, I've seen it for like, a minute, and it sucks.
lol xD
I wouldn't call that cowardice, rather a "drama sense": Like when she was just standing there doing nothing, letting Chrysalis finish her rant.
Wait, this chat had another arguement?
09,01brb
seems like it Litwick
/me gets hugged by ALL the Deathclaws... Including Rawr ;~;
Sarcasm is about tone of voice, youc an't communicate sarcasm over text unless you flat out state it.
Okay, back to form again
Well, since I don't want to get postreading cancer, I won't bother seeing what it is.
So my mIRC is unable to resolve server. What do?
True
Monfang: I just watched that trifecta vid, I believe many of their points were invalid. They keep saying it was a show for toddler girls, Faust herself even said she made the show for kids AND their parents...
hehe
Meanwhile, pinkie pie is down, thats probably it
http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3fa87oqdS1qjvsoxo1_500.gif
hello all my fellow bronies
try applejack.ponychat.net?
Phase4: Ah. Ty.
Rawr gives the manliest hugs ever
Oh hai xmasskills
Monfang: yeah well about you dont talk crap that isnt even true about me to others
I swear
this isn't a DDoS
Hello xmasskills
Hugs so manly, if you can out man him, he gives you his hand to kill others with.
Gunthler: The guy on the right was bitting at the bit to talk about this. I suspect he was being harsher than he really wanted to be. But I doubt any of them saw the show really.
Meanwhile, use the main round-robin: irc.ponychat.net
RX-78-SweetieBot: http://inception.davepedu.com/
http://i.imgur.com/vHe88.jpg
lol suddenly chat ded
RX-78-SweetieBot: MY MIND:O
RX-78-SweetieBot: What the heck, I can't comprehend wat is happening in that picture :D
Twilight, I can't tell. Are you being sarcastic or not?
http://i.imgur.com/NJ79j.jpg
Who the hell makes all those button websites?
Monfang: how do you imagine sarcasm would even work here?
Success.
Thanks Phase4.
I don't know, you said you were being sarcastic.
I'd think you know.
Meanwhile, np
Monfang: Yeah, I don't think any of em saw the show...
I dunno, button websites are strange
Monfang: think a little before you talk and accuse someone of something

Gunthler: Most likely, however I do agree with their assement about people escaping from reality with the show. I've seen it happen with Furries and Otherkin.
Someone should stream Planescape: Torment :o
Monfang: Yupo.
Dat file.
Are you being sarcastic or can I reply to that one, Twilight?
Cant see a THING!
lol, Monfang
Nukes... fixes and break ALL THINGS
I just bought super Paper Mario today. Haven't palyed it yet though. Is it any good?
Can't see shit Captain.
Stupid computer! >:U
dem bots
Litwick: Don't expect too much
Monfang: ugh forget it, youre not keeping up. and id appreciate if you would take back what you said to zappy
I have that game and I do enjoy it
I have heard good things about it though.
dat lazor
I can't tell, is Twilight being Sarcastic or is he being serious?
Detonate ALL the warheads!
/me is sad
RaritySWAG
>:D
Why sad Kipkat07_Mare.
Litwick: It's better to form your own opinion about it
I have to assume sarcasm unless he says otherwise.
What's wrong Kipkat07_Mare?
This sentence is sarcastic.
is Confues
Why is that funny.
Oh that'd make a good logic bomb, ehm
confused*
xD
No one knows when I'm sarcastic on the internet, but no one knows when I'm sarcastic in real life :s
well im gonna go get my haircut now....cya!!!
Monfang: no-it-was-not
:O
Monfang : are you being sarcastic?
Bye That_British_Guy.
:D
Bai That_British_Guy
Bye That_British_Guy
:U
Wait, That_British_Guy it's like midnight
Whoops
Who gets a haircut at midnight.
Obser-viking?
not where im at Meanwhile
I need to pirate some more ponies...
Oh well Twilight, let me put my serious pants back on. /sarcasm (see what I did there?)
lol
That_British_Guy: it can't be that different where you are.
Monfang: youre a waste of my time.
Bye
haha
Meanwhile: I have started to realize that, throughout my life, I have been in the worst schools in the country and I most likely wont get into an Ivy League college like I have dreamed of.
Meanwhile Im in North Carolina USA
:P
That_British_Guy: Your name is misleading.
Meanwhile: And its too late to change that
No one said he wasn't an immigrant
Monfang: oh and btw trolling nullifies all your credibility.
There should be a punctuation mark for sarcasm
There is one
I thought I was a waste of your time, yet you come crawling back. Am I just that sexy, Twilight?
I'm happy! Oh,wait sorry...it's not Friday. :D
I usually put emotes next to sarcasm xD
Kipkat07_Mare: I'm sorry you feel that way, but surely this college will mark you on ability rather than where you've been beforehand?
HOW CAN A BEEP SOUND WISFUL!?
Thats usually the only way I can do it Polydunami
Okay, stop fighting you guys
PinkieLovesMe beep
I wanna see some BRONY ACTION here!
hot brony action
beep
13SirGanjalf: google interrobang
MMA BRONY EDITION!
Fighting is gonna get nopony anywhere.
Meanwhile: My high school lost its accreditation and Im too poor to move to another state.
Monfang: actually your horrid face is what makes people interested in you
؟okay, couldn't find it
HELLO EVERYPONY!!!!!!!!!!!
Seriously. Stop with the insults
Oh hai ponies47

Anyone in the chat doing a Nuzlocke run?
yep
Dem explosions.
1,3If more than one sentence is a textwall then this is not a textwall because it is only one sentence, and it's not that long only very dry with lots of words that go on and on and on until I get bored and run out of space, except you never really know when that's going to happen until it happens and I get bored and just end the sentence and glomp MakerDusk
/me glomps MakerDusk
ValtheJean: Where's the elephant? :d

That_British_Guy: why do you wanna be a marine?
/me drops a whole trailer of dust into the channel
OMB|Chozo_Ghost: So i get to deal with them my way ^^
And then the maids have to clean it up. It's part of their OCD.
I mean sure one class misfit is OK but a room full of them? Not so much...
hi I'm new here ^^' so yeah not quite sure how this site works :)
/me 13coughs on dust .-.
(drops a little dust and a piece of toast onto the channel, and in real life, my floor):P

One thing that I have a problem with about this game series. It's been 200 years since the cities were destroyed by nukes. Why isn't there more vegetation overgrowing everything?
LOL: JUST CAME HER FROM FALLOUT §
aaand appearantly i hit capslock
twilight_sprinkle well not really, my dad just got promoted to Sgt Major last year
Dark_Horst: and now youre bak in fallout
EpicPwnTime2 according to Kevin Nash (anime reference) Three wrongs. that equals one right, with the remainder of one wrong. That should reverse everything!
The radiation probably killed everything, or something.
Dark_Horst: you might have
Kandarihu|Mourning: Radiation, nucluar winter
That_British_Guy: wait really
It works on "Science!" so I'm not exactly sure.

Hey RAWRity :)
ValtheJean: this is called BRONYSTATE right? and last time I checked a brony is a older fan of MLP FiM
I heard this was the place where pony addicts go to get their fix, so i came here
Which is slowly working it's way into my system...
0,14oh hai RAWRity
ValtheJean: do you like MLP FiM?
2,14 that's what it USED to mean
Shamroc your flash player couldn't handle all that awesome
of couse not
otakon: How old is older?
2,14 the term has evolved past that point now
Dken2021 nope
what does it mean then?
2,14 and it no longer applies to me
iT STILL MEANS IT!
TheHoodyNinja: older then 15
/me 11,01pets RAWRity
That's it. I'm not doing any more editing. My fanfic is done!
FOR ME!
ValtheJean: so you no longer likes MLP FiM
otakon: So that means im not a brony?
WHOA!
o_o
I have no idea
WHOA
omfg....
lol
:o
o_O
11,01Brony = MLP fan for me.

Wait, wait, WHATS GOING ON?

Come back! D:
ValtheJean: As long as you watch the show and like the community, your a brony

Dken2021: D:

ValtheJean: Then why are you here?
@ValtheJean says a mod on Bronystate
my face right now: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/23419?search=favorited_by%3DLittleLostPony
so he can troll using stream
video chat? like Chatroullete :D
ValtheJean: huh? I'm kind of confused on this explanation. Habits of the evolved community? What are the habits of the evolved community besides fan music/art/games and stories?
ValtheJean: Why are you here then? this is BRONYstate.
firedrill thysay/

I've seen this like three times on the stream and still have no idea what the original anime is.

Spike would be the better choice for Viral : Non-Pony - Non-Spiral
2,14 SparkleButt: -_-
Alright, thanks!
Is it worth watching?
2,14 I play it as an introduction to my Gurren Lagann streams -_-
SparkleButt hellz to the yeah!

innuendo deteched
ValtheJean: btw did we finish red dwarf?
RoboGerbil: kinda hard to get them too..
2,14 no, I just need to find my season 7 disc
ook
@ValtheJean spoiling the ending to introduce people to the series. This confirms my theory tthat you are a troll
Japanese Transformer Diebuster?
With alchemists?
Huzzah, time for ponies! :D
2,14 because this spoils so much?
ye
yes
IT'S THE ENDING
1,3technically they spoil it themselves in the first episode
MFW I found out there is a brony living a few blocks away from my house : http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/143/
2,14 it's a PMV
Tenga Toppa Gurren Lagaan. Insanely over the top, an excuse for some of the most insane fnservice, utterly preposterous concet, totally ridiculous mecha, and a premise that makes no sense at all. And somehow it STILL manages to be one of the most awesone anime ever.
because I lost control of my life
The final fight is not nearly as awesome without the buildup
2,14 and anyone who hasn't watched Gurren Lagann has no fucking idea what's going on

Dem anime pervs :3
connect me to a specific MUD or MUSH that is associated with that keyword
Mutterguy: she does look a bit like a White Mage
that was just undecent...
celestians?
or indecent
pwned
twilight_sprinkle: THAT WAS NOT FANSERVICE DAMN YOU
Celestians? Princesses?
otakon: Except it was
There's at least ONE perv in most animes
otakon: are you kidding me? did you see how they highlighted her *yay*
-______________________-

SaxyPretender: it happens sometimes
your mom
pervs are pretty much a staple in anime
twilight_sprinkle: just watch the ep
:o
still talking about fanservice again... god just enhoy the damn show >.<
Dken2021: try telling that to twilight_sprinkle
Dken2021: I blame cultural diferences
damn i can't spell tonight
You know, this episode totally ignores genetics and the insane inbreeding that would result.
otakon: fanservice is fanservice
yeah identical twins and fraternal triplet i guess
Gurren Laghann...wanted ta see more so i went to Netflex...and seen it all. seein it again makes it better
twilight_sprinkle: it's in every anime except the most realistic
twilight_sprinkle: oh and miyazaki stuff
Yeah. I read somewhere that there needs to be at least 200 or 300 people in order to be stable.
otakon: realistic animes ? does not exist
otakon: honestly, very few animes highligh womens *yay* like that
00,10Celestians?
yep, i've been getting into those
I think it's ironic how they're called Celestians, the fact that they little amount of light
it's something different
lol
lolwut
Alister: Jin Roh for one
*they have
02hai Umbreon :3
sounds like messy garbage
Er, in order for the gene pool to be stable.

Wait, celestians? I don't see any wings on them
twilight_sprinkle: it wasn't hightlighted the hell are you talking about?

otakon: it was clearly emphasized
I need to know what episode number this is.
0,145
5, I believe.
I'm bored........
otakon: in that kick scene
eww a booger
i like the Lyra poping up her head
oh crap..............
otakon: that was some serious fan service, school of dead level
Last night, I saw part of one episode of TTGL but dozed off. Did I miss any E7 last night?
Bro dies

RainBowJack: wha?

Magic: hey hi

Hiiyo Magic

Magic y u so magical!

Is there an equivalent of wingboner for Unicorns ?
infinite loops in 3..2..1..
Kandarihu|Mourning: obviously?Oo

Alister: horn twang?

Celestial lands

what's the point of that again
cuz thats what I am lol
and DIE your moron
because remembering servers is annoying
otakon: maybe he has an attraction to the same sex?
Send them to Canterlot
/me eats a stick of dynamite for fun
gaybrony91: ah, just wondering

Alright everypony. I'm gonna head to bed. See you all later :)

Admin: I do. :3
Admin: I do
otakon: Also this episode doesn't have alot of action
Alister: yeah but it's a character one
Dken2021: nope, much worse: a furry network

ValtheJean: Okay, I know you don't like brohoofs, but the sentiment is there.
MakerDusk: the hell....

Night Bronystate don't let NMM or Molestia bite.

Shizuka: you are a cruel mod
13i am too!

Night JoseEnriquez

Shizuka: nah, you have to take over from services for that
Shizuka: you scare me.
13aw
See ya later JoseEnriquez
My name... Such a wierd ping...
mah boi
13next april fools~
Magin is a boss ;)
O.O
you /kill the service and then take it's name ^_^
00,10if he cant read it......
Shizuka: Why wait for April? That's a whole year away~
can't read, make a bible, shrugs
Sumica: he's been making it up
do you know that rainbow dash can kill starscreen
00,10how does he know it's the scriptures?
Yes, Sumica . He made all that stuff up.
who knows
Sumica: told
Sumica: It's the symbolism of the book.
Bau5ness
storm: old news
1,3he made it all up...
its probably empty
He actually found the book
11 months rarely
1,3wait he had a bible?
Im back from psychological testing!
1,3:3
I just learned something horrifying, and kind of hilarious
Sumica: Nobody else can read, so how are they supposed to disagree with him?
kirzstryfe: kind of
Mods thought they'd get rid if me that easy... Nice try
WHAT NOW?
*really
That's why my name is admin...
That was... meh
yay
What is it, RAWRity?
code geass ftw
00,10Dat code geass
RAWRity yes?
Admin: dude, don't taunt them just don't advertise
13ooo a wiseass
Gurren Lagann, followed by Code Geass? It's like all of my favourite shows, one after the other!
kirzstryfe: moo
1,3you were kicked, Admin, you really want to push it?
You guys are familiar with the Ghibli films, correct?
13i like wiseasses
on
yes
I wasn't advertising... Didn't mean to at least
wow celestia radio who knew
but I love taunting the mods
RAWRity: no.
Sorry
13they make a nice crunchy sound when you squish them
RAWRity: Pom Poko?
Just when I start to give anime a chance. some does a bland PMV with a anime song. WAY TO MAKE ME HATE ANIME EVEN MORE
just not when they can see it
2,14 the real question is who gets to have fun with him?
and then he turned out to be an IRCop :P
RAWRity: Studio Ghibli kicks ass.
RAWRity: Think I've seen the most of them.
SEE! HE's sorry don't ban him dammit!
Mods are fun, just don't piss them off...
2,14 we mods do get SO bored when trolls don't show themselves for very long
Alister: Have you seen Code Geass yet?
that's the right attitude
am I fun too, Admin?
13mods are fun, they add content to your game and don't afraid of anything
1,3let's see, speaking of another site's services, then linking to their feed, that would count as advertising
2,14 we need a good banning every now and again to feed our joy of inflicting pain
Reikim: why should I ?
Well, I just learned that, back in the day, in japan, "My Neighbor Totoro" was released as a double feature...alongside "Grave of the Fireflies"
I know I know... Sorry
oh come on mods let the guy have a little fun, if hee keeps advertsing then ban him
Alister: I'm in the same boat too. I'm yet to find an anime that has peaked my interest
ValtheJean: you are a cruel bastard
2,14 yes, yes I am
2,14 and I love it
Alister: I was just wondering. Personally I enjoyed it, though I know it's not everyone's cup of tea.
me too
RAWRity: Oh yeah, I remember hearing about that
ValtheJean: -__________-
13silly otakun this is not cruel yet
We love u too ValtheJean
/me 11,01scrubs ValtheJean
Shizuka: it's getting there
RAWRity: OK. Follow an emtertaining uplifting film with the greatest downer in history. Sound's legit... for Japan.
RAWRity never knew that
I need moar coffee
Trolling is fun, you can't deny that otakon
I'm curel and I know iy
it*
SunderlandPony89: it's NOT fun
ikr Kencolt
1,3I'd prefer not to have to ban him, I like celestia radio personally, but people need to actually take notice of the channel rules when they join a chat
Kencolt: Which movie is this?
Moar MANGA
how grim is grave of the fireflies?
/me wishes he was a mod sometimes
0,14very
