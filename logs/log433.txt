02EW compairing NVIDEA and ATi
06why that?
03because they're all customized by OEMs and crap
02omparing*
06ikr?
02comparing*
03I just get the NVIDIA drivers straight from nvidia.com
03but that's rare, 99% of the time it's not that easy :/
You can normally grab upstream drivers from nvidia or AMD, at least for newer cards
03nope
03go to their site and it's like
/me is augmented
03"Sorry, go get them from the OEM"
02NVIDEA and ATi are both pretty much the same if you ask me
hmm
06ATI RS690M, can find it? xD
03it's NVIDIA< first of all
I asked for this song
lies
03Lighty, from the computer manufacturer
03:/
:3
Depends on the card as I said
06i know
02that too
Go via the OEMs website
AWESOME!!!!

03did they do movie films though or just pictures?
03the other thing with movie film is it has the audio on the side of the images
02I think they did both
03my regular scanner isn't going to know how to handle that
03hm
dont know why, just feels like it could be >_>
03because I'd totally mail this to some place that can do it for me
03I want 4k Pokémon footage, even if it's only 2 mins long :P

02EC is 3+
instead of talking you say you did something
02not 6+
YO 'SUP
Same difference
14ohh
and dismissing games just because of their rating makes me want to go find the I PLAY HARDCORE MATURE GAMES FOR MATURE GAMERS LIKE ME image macro
yes
14I don't really follow ESRB/PEGI ratings
14they are a joke
Yeah
1418+ in Italy
14wut
Some games dont' deserve to be T
(Knocking down ratings that is)
06the netherlands did this:
6http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/pokmon-how-to-hatch-an-egg.jpg
02hence my joke
Same with movies
they're recommendations not like
limits/rules
*cough*Emulators > everything *cough*
anyway
14Espeon, I can understand a difference like 2-3 years
Alcohp;ic_Tempest: You can diss on battlefeild all you want but SSX does not suck
yes i agree
14what kind of recommendation is that? xDD
I dont like Battlefield 3. I loved all the previous Battlefields
yeah
both suck get skyrim
mfw I have no face
*gasp*
and the lazy solution nowadays seems to be
lol They are pretty much the same in my book
ITC: Opinions stated as fact.
or "Experience might change during online play!!"
skyrim is pretty boring after the first playthrough... it got boring really fast
6LOL
6that one always made me laugh
lmao that's p. dumb
dragons
lol
02yeah
magic
reminds me of the sa "hot coffee" thing just not as stupid and overblown in the gaming media
02^
02Lol.
lolLC
0,5It goes fast.
Hey Everyone.
~
06me neither
14except Madworld. That was a very fun experiment xDD
06i PLAY all the games i can get
designed it should have their license to make games revoked
or their fingers removed
:J
Prolly the only thing that pulls me through the week
14after 5 minutes Iwas like "WTF IS THIS EVEN LEGAL"
14xDDD
02xD
INB4 madworld wii
and changing rating due to something modders do
02CaLLing?
02well, the person had to hack it to even do that
Being a consolefag I've never played the first two
it wont happen though... no one seems to like top down tactical games much anymore...
Hi all :)
know its just a rip off of the elder scrolls
14I'd rather to have all games rated 18+ instead of having them all censored though :/
:U
lmao censored gaems
0218+ rating!!! >:@@@@@
:$
02says ESRB
/me runs
14sometimes 18+ isn't even enough
censored?
nv is too easy
14Dementium was censored in europe
Still it all comes down to one thing... does it kill time fast enough?
14why? Because it was on DS
14<w<
http://i.imgur.com/5a2Wj.jpg
Hello
06why? NO SILLY RATINGS
Opinion > Opinions
06trolololol~
>.>
I always want to fight :)
14lol
Star Wars: Battlefront 2
06Opinions > Opinions < Opninions
and drink
Wut?
one of the opinions was spelt wrong
even though you can cosplay...doesnt mean you should
lol
lols
:p
06ye sGL they have
haha
SNES > all
Or NES > all
14^
14SNES
Thats why the world loves us :$
TTGL yoko? Or Castlevania yoko?
02SNES > All]
14NES is too choppy sometimes
06SNES was good
02heck, I've even seen Android games with ratings
02I agree
hmm
first
fun?
13moment
Good afternoon everypony!! :)
BattleField 1942 Ftw
allo allo eveyrpony

Drinking, fighting, luck and potatoes
Because the S/NES has no DLC, no loading times, no bad multiplayer, no disks, has backwords compatability with the GC/portable consoles, it never breaks, it never requires updates
14newer ones seem just too much...easy
MY day has been prertty good :)
Potatoes are always good in My book
oh yeah... luck...
hello every pony :P

Goldeneye 007 N64 best shooter
:L>
and suddenly Reboot
with little sound
Or 'better FPS' at least
there were probably trollers in the early 1900s
02TF2 is best shooter :3
06im like: LOOOOOOOOOL f*ck off
06Doom is :P
06if everyone is fanboying on FPS
TF2 is probably the best one I've played of FPS tbh.
Bye everypony

06:P
Like Doom

14it was kind of an FPS
13RUN AWAY
it does go the other way too, playing only popular games
14more than the other two Prime games
i.e the millions that never play anything but CoD
Metroid Prime ftw
:D
06Doom is not overrated, its awesome, and thats a real fact
Hi everypo... wtf is this shit.

/me huggles back~
Good, good.
14people need to hate
of course
14being a gaming community = reason to hate people
05its been terrable
14*in a
05i*
14most of times at least
14:P
05but ive managed
02^
why?
05right now i jsut want to relax some before i gotta sleep
http://derpy.me/qWQbK
05due to school
06we all have out ups and downs
myspace?
13it's reboot wrek~<3
but then again using the cod community as an example is pretty trollish in itself
14I find console wars very stupid
14and I said "wars"
14not "polite discussions"
console wars are literally for

again
g2g guys bye!!

06yea
Shame I'm not in that group
especially as 95% of the people using it uses it when they are actually the scrub
06someone went like this:

I am 22 today

03I did that once
03nothing bad happened

Since stream's over, I can safely post THIS to help my friend through her rough times.

My birthday is this month, too! But not for a while ^_^
one sec
https://www.change.org/petitions/help-reverse-deportation-order-on-ramon-cordoba-and-maria-isabel-viveros Here we are. Sign this to help a friend of mine.
I turned the key into the position to start the engine (where just one more position switches on the starter motor) and let the truck roll briefly
yep
lel.
then I was able to start the engine without any problem
Umm... If I were a pony, I would be o////o

03mainboard temp is at 65, LOL
03but it's a relatively low-end NVIDIA, not a high end as it had to be low profile
I'm busy tonight
03and GTS520 was the best I could get :/
03oh hey it cooled off by a few degrees
03now lemme run prime95 for like 15 mins
I wants to cuddle ;3;
03should I run it longer to let the thermal paste "settle" or whatever?
Its annoying
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3271/
Humid too
i haven't eaten all day.
cant
Doesnt matter
Silence of the ponies
03OK
has to do with the oven being broke.
It can cook in over time
03I know some people say you have to burn it in
Hot and humid
Meh, only really need to if you are going to srsly overclock it out of the gate
I see
Otherwise, just let it cook over time
03OK wow um
I still didn't play l4d
wat
03running Prime95 here
03it's up to 70C
As you need to get the paste over the cores
03*fans
50 = 10 celsius
03yes
figuratively, not literally.
http://bit.ly/nGoPl0
03it's a passive heatsink
night guys
LOL
05finally
I'm back!
05Remenant power armor

03it's now at 73.5
03should I turn it off?
Means its underclocking itself like crazy
I would stop running prime95

I did say that stock cooling most likely wouldnt do the job >__>
