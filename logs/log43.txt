03because ew highly addicting games
0*honour
12lol
7Well, the engine.
.cc.co should just be free permenantly with no input required.
This is bront state, and we are OUT!
Spike's bulge still disturbs me....
*Brony
uh
I honestly don't care, it's not like we should have any issue with it being .cc.co
7Okay,.
damnit SSH, stop lagging
I honestly don't care either.
bront > brontosaurus > my prehistoric pony?
if it works, it works.
Fine I'll get that.
Hmm.
5 sub domains and addon domains.
try it?
7Okay.
7Last time before I sleep for the night. :)
That's not bad, for the purpose we'd be using it for.
Got the email
Awesome, I'm glad they took down the logo
It'd also come with 5 email accounts.
no password still?
We don't really need email accounts, but that's cool I suppose.
I thought I was joking when I said it goes for 55 more minutes.
this is the song that never ends
yes it goes on and on my friend
12Hello AntWhite

7All right.

A mod with a banstick (not all mods get bansticks on this forum).

03YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO MAKE THAT PUBLIC FFS
10so

XD
Alright.
10How often do we want meetings?
10Like this
4I'm doubletasking like crazy
4*multitasking
I'm re-watching pony episodes right now. I'm fine.
yeah and really, everyone cares :3
I'd be fine with once every two weeks. Frankly, most any time is good.
At least, for me.
10ok
10Same here
Guys...um...I got a problem...
10what day?
10also time
I redid the site, but it's missing the stream.
I'll get you the link.
4Lol
10Just to let you you don't have to be there
10ok
I tend to be on during the day as well, but schedules tend to shift around a lot, y'know?
<script type="text/javascript"> fid="BronyState"; v_width="700"; v_height="520";</script>
10yes
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://veemi.com/javascript/embedPlayer.js"></script>
<iframe width="700" height="520" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" src="http://www.veemi.com/embed.php?v=BronyState&amp;vw=700&amp;vh=520&amp;domain=www.dinkypage.com"></iframe>
I think that's it.
10how about next weekend?
IT WORKS!
*saves*
10Also can you get rid of this? http://www.spyropedia.com/wiki/File:Cynder.jpg
10it's the cynder jpg
I should be available then, and sure thing.
Yeah.
10*the
10ok next
10pages that we need/keep/delete
...there's two of them.
That code you gave me gives me two of the same stream. XD
Elaborate a little, please?
Dunno then, I just took that from the source of the old page.
Can we get rid of Cynder?
Okay.
10you mean the page?
Oh wait Vivendi already killed her.
10no
Just like they killed Elora.
10it was an image
Ignore him. He's being an idiot.
10kk
VIVENDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Alright, pages we need.
10Contact Us/staff
10we need that
Yes.
That's inappropriate.
10>.>
I'm trying to think of ways to redesign the main page.
But I need GRAFFIXS
10*are
12bbl
I know Uxie was attempting to write up a Manual of Style, too.
10Well we can do that when we can get a hold of her
10Next do we want fanon/fandom/fanfics?
I'd personally try to avoid fanon and fanfiction, since then we'll have any random shmuck coming in to advertise their fanfic.
10ok
I'd say for the moment, we'll leave that be and get back to it later.
10ok
10Featured Articles
10we neeed to run this
10Like run this good
10So FA should be for good pages
Yeah.
Oh featured articles.
How I loathe you.
10>.>
10I think we can get some good pages up there
10also it needs a good image to be a FA
Good image?
10i png file
10and not fanon
10and try for a full shot
10no like a pic of their head
Yeah.
10Also is TTE ok?
10Well yes
And am I okay?
OF COUUUUURSE
10But we need a MoS
10So we have a guideline
My sarcasm is evident though. BECAAAAAUSE I blame Vivendi for everything.
Bastards. Greedy corporate bastards.
Same with Craptivision.
NEVAR
4Bye!
10>.>
Same issue we encountered at Bulbapedia. There's no real... anything.
It all depends on the page itself.
10Right
10like maybe story and history for the characters
Maybe.
10Yes we should have that
10Also a sub page for images
Now THOSE...
Quotes...
I can make a template for.
Make it in the style of Spyro 2/3 boxes.
10http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page this is where i come from
Because AHT's were lame, Spyro 1's had UNREADABLE FONT...
10and it works
10>.>
10Anyways before it went down we were doing good
...get that picture of Bentley off there. That's not Bentley.
But it's not.
I've got more reason to have my heart sink at that than you do, but even I can suck it up and focus on the important.
wb
more like sheila can suck it up
*snicker*
>:|
EITHER WAY
:D
10http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Gallery:Jupiter_Dragon_Traps pages like this
10This good page
That could be doable in one of those enemy tables you were thinking of, right?
14thanks :>
Like, maybe have a parameter.
/me freezes
I suppose.
10it really shows how they look and act
/me defrosts
10Also how you die
O good. My electricity came back on. People are still here?
(Also also, does anyone have a problem if I delete the Timeline article?)
Timeline?
There's three.
10not really
Maybe four.
Kill it.
10If we have to we can do it again
10http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Dragon_Eggs
10So for the most part i did that
10i'm not really sure
10I think Uxie knows more
I know after EtD that Vivendi laid on the bad puns thick...
:O
10I just get the pics and text
PS2 emulator?
10no
10Gamecube
wat
Ironic
10Dolphin
4!pokemon
Hooh54, you are a 7Jumpluff.
OHWOW
10MY PS2 emu lags to much
4Pluff buff
haha
10Thanks
10That is the type of page we need
lol
Yes.
I can already say, in terms of needed information...
10http://www.spyropedia.com/wiki/Zoe_%28Fairy%29 not this
10Weird how it adds the %
%28 is the code for a parenthesis, I think.
lol
10same
12XD
._.
yeah I imagine it would
%28 is open parenthesis, %29 is close parenthesis. Does that for all non-alphanumeric characters.
XD
4.-.
Yeah.
...hmm, GCN emulator?
12Ascendant XD
10no
Because I got the PS1 Spyro screens straight off my own copies of Spyro 1, 2, and 3.
4tRUE
10I got the file
4*True
10:)
12allyourmssagscomoutlikthis
Well, like I care. AHT was developed on the GCN anyway, which is why they fucked up and flipped Flame/Charge in the PS2 version.
Probably because the GCN version of EtD crashed less.
XD
Hmm...
10ok we have seen both egg pages
Any of you guys have Dropbox?
!chatstats
Or have I already pushed it on you?
4allyourmessagesarebelongtousb
Alright, the Egg page.
4XD
lol
honestly
4Geodudette
tl;dr Dropbox is a file-sharing system.
10http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Dragon_Eggs http://www.spyropedia.com/wiki/Dragon_Eggs
Alright.
10oh ok
10Spyropedia has about the same info as shout
!digimon
Just not extended into a walkthrough.
I'll merge the text to my best, anyway.
Gimme a few minutes.
12LOL
4!digimon
Hooh54, you are a 6IceLeomon.
10Just go to edit then cop and paste and we can do the images
12this works i just laid the keyboard over the laptop keyboard
10sub page?
Nah, separate pages.
Categorized as Lists of collectibles.
10wouldn't it be easy to just have it as a sub page?
10Like List of Spyro: A hero's tail Eggs
10maybe add a /
10for a sub
Well.
Regardless.
10ok
10yea that would work
This category is empty.
10>.>
10......
Scuba diving.
10ok for?
See you all later.
03what keyboard o.o
...games...
4Ascendant
I see.'
10Darkeiya would it be ok for us to add http://crashbandicoot.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page as a External Page
12drf
12to replace the laptop keyboard that was dying on me?
Hmmm...
As an external page where?
10And a EX page from us spyropedia to them
03yeah
yes Hooh54?
4Nothing, look at Silversonic's post (I think?)
lol
I noticed
Yeah, I know all the games... and the consoles they're on.
!digimon
10ok good
wat
>|
4Cerberumon is actually pretty cool
12so yes exactly drf
10also to note me or Uxie can't edit the main page as it's locked
12but i guess just laying it over the laptop keyboard is working very nicely
Of course.
Otherwise anyone could just edit it.
10brb
I'm gonna include parameters for several boxart images...
That way it can cycle through them,
Okay.
0 8 30
4Goodnight!
Have i missed the event.
0yes youhave
night all
Alright. I believe I've managed to merge the pages.
http://www.spyropedia.com/wiki/Dragon_Egg
I'll transparentize the egg images from AHT and then add them in.
there's another movie tomorrow?
Yeah.

having the site lopsided to the left bothered me
^I second that
06o.o
11Centering is good for keeping things in order, but if it's used for everything, it can change from looking good to barely readable. Though that's mainly when it comes to text.
Fun o.o
yeah, there isn't much text on this site
2anywayz, after he switched, they also fell asleep (DV) and one got paralyzed. THAT'S when he disconnected

11You're welcome.
I would assume it would be about the same time as last year, but if that was the case they probably would have told us already
since theres really only like 3 months left
thoughts?
8i dont even think they have the first episode of the season completely done yet
tl;dr ALL IS HOPEFUL

my id is mustelide

wrong smiley:(
11Outside of regular BMN, we kick as we please, usually out of fun.
grrr
11grr :P
actually I cant blame you. I would probably do the same.
11Like I said, it's all in good fun, though.
11Nothing meant by it.
11Try it. >: )
mmmm
0THE TEMPTATION IS UNBEARABLE!!!!
8We kick for the enjoyment we anticipate experiencing after performing said activity sometimes
8if we're kicking you for cause, we make it clear in the kick message
15*wince
12*wince again
11I used to use that color. Most people said it was hard to read though.
it was :P
especially for those mammoth paragraphs of trivia
I'm back~
ARGH
but for some reason I also think that colour suits you more..
I forgot how redtardly annoying this bridge was
11Thank you.
´sup everyponie
Anything fun going on`?
11I'm abusing my mod powers again.
^ been there, done that >.<
and I'm playing GT5
11How about I slap YOU?!
:D
and you briefly sent me into a minor panic because I thought I'd lost my colgate+twilight but they were right by my computer
04Why hello
8i meant to ask
He´s on the 19th episode now I think
/me 2is sleepy~
0ha
lol
2o hai thare
nice
The first two
8whats the deal with the random links to the homepage on the homepage?
We made a deal, he made me watch an awful movie, and I made him watch an "awful" movie
8the words "win" and "offers" are randomly links
lol
oh yeah saw that
Wow...that's odd.
8#winning
0hmm
>:U
I just fell off the same part of the road twice in a row
derp
oh wow. XD
It's because of my browser
join #bronystaterequests
came really cloe to a third time
whoops
that didn't work
heh
O_o
Derp
We have this channel?
o.o
wat
yeah
0what should I say to my pony-hating friend
Ahh.
I've been in that situation it's hard
8i tried to convert my best friend, he didnt bite
:(
8only watched 5 mins of fall weather friends before turning it off
lol
Nono you have to start with the first episode
oops
I'm trying to get my sister and her husband to watch an episode.
>/b/. >call people pedophiles
wat
8i wanted to start with the least "girly" episode
Don't know how to go about it though.
I think that the first episode is the best converting one
Hmm, which episode is the most violent?
I think that because spike steals the limelight from twilight quite a bit, it makes the first one less girly
and thus more bearable
The first one is important, it introduces the characters
11Same here
And confusion leads to dislike
Specifically Reservior Ponies
Ep. 25*
I think the pilot is a good idea
11It's been fixed.
:3
12:)
:D
0Are you
yeah I've come across a lot of porn
11Yeah.

Fave Mane poney is Random Poney

Elision: did you read the alicorn chapter that came out more recently?
I haven't D: is it good?

DSL is still the best *shot*
MAG is alright, Socom was never my flavor

It's pretty neat. Though incredibly ugly and large.
COD2 had a level about normandy. it was frickin amazing.
germans: dayum painkillah
Tu aimes cette film?
i'm not the FPS-type of person, i prefer strategy over action... hence MAG
That's some hardcore shit
ikr cod 2s d day finale was intense
Armored Assault?

Ce film est un bon film de guerre./Good War Movie is Good.

PROTIP: You need a weapon to kill people.

I don't read fanfics at all. I read some of the comics, but I never read fanfics
And that's why I respect that.
This movie made me cry and teach me to be a patriot to America. Thing is, I'm Canadian.
Pikaru, heh,cool. :)
Well I haven't read any fanfic at all
8it causes too much drama
how about the Luna games
/me is going to make OC pony reaction images, even though he doesn't post on ponychan, or anywhere that requires it.
8RainBro, why don't you post on Ponychan?
I've never been to Ponychan, or 4chan
Yes.
the one on Newgrounds, Charmin?
Pony Rain has a psychological twist that makes it good. Same for Pony Psychology.
yes
8Ponychan is basically my home
oh the snes one with the creepy town D:
Charmin, you played that too? :D
oh, that one. saw it on EQD, didn't read yet
@Hipster_Brony I just don't really engage that well with the majority of the posters. I like the scene but I just don't find it that enjoyable for some reason. I don't really understand it myself
*Happy

umm...
