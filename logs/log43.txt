The evil enchantress killed the aliens?

And once again the day is saved, thanks to Will Smith!
Wow, that's racist

8What a tweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeest
AND THEN THEY FUCKED
11maxaminusone: Actually, since they're in an older model ship, it wasn't synched to the Alien Mothership.

Baddass walk
0Hey NewDCD!
And then they sexed
Thankfully, the moon was completely unaffected
/me 0brohoofs NewDCD
And that´s the story on how equestria was made
4I wonder if the aliens dropped any good loot
This begins a new era. Of shacking hair back and forth.
And once again, the day is saved.
And they forgot to pick Luna up on the way home.
Hrreeeh
Sklar
eh, just a +4 dagger
yes
You got a potion for killing the aliens
TL;DW
+1 cigar
sklar
theres bound ot be thousands of alien survivors, they would prolly have to deal with all of them, like a ground war, sounds like a good campaign for a FPS
Tht kid is a idiot.
I wonder if there´s any liquor in the wreckages
Sounds more like how the humans prevented an invasion to Equestria
And meteors killed everyone
The End
Yay genocide=fireworks
cigar has +10 charisma
when they killed the aliens first
Slut
Rocks fall everyone dies.
I'd play a game like that.
4That's all? a +4 dagger, one cigar, and a potion?
And then they fucked
yes charmin
dne eht
SEEYA GUYS! BRONIES FOREVER!!!
So what makes them think that wasn't just a small preliminary attack force.
Luna: "...guys? Guys? Hello? ... ... is anyone... ... they said they'd give me a ride back..."
4Man, fuck this movie
THE END
A-MARE-ica

SPAAAAAACE
guys, what are your thoughts?
well it's only 1pm, so
Is it better for colors to be for users, or for mods?
We'd like your opinion
and DRAKE
SPACE
orion
DCD, what are you doing?
Colors for mods makes more sense.
BOTH
Colours for mods!
READ A BOOK
Mods have colors for reasons
I prefer us normal folk to use white.
Colors for modes is good
Classic.
Mods using colors makes it easy to spot mod comments'
Colours for mods, deffo
sigh, come on DCD...
exactly
why the fuck would he post that?
Kudos to the person who made the pink pony intro
0I like colors being for mods, when I first joined I didn't understand why, the next time I came and we hit critical mass, it became clear like THAT.
Because then individual mods can be told apart a lot easier NewDCD, it's just a shitload easier that way, and a lot less eyesoreish
can u default it
it's raining candy
*shrugs* That's what I want to know
04whaaaaat
Person who made Pink Pony was SilkAMV.
0colors are for UBER MODS ONLY THEY COTRAIL EVERYTHANG EVEN WHITE HOUSE
I like RenegadeBrony
Just saying
I like the colours for mods option
too many colours makes it hard to read
Rly
0everyone having colors would be CHAOS
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEEEEEEEEEEE
Drake
oh noes, the staremaster!!
TWILIGHT SPARKLE evolved into RAPIDASH!
0PUTTIN ON DA RITZ
THE STARE.
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
IT IS MAGICAL.
Yet I can sehow stand it.
I surrender Fluttershy!

Were you looking at his posts?

also how can I give you guys my hosted game's address in TF2
In response to colorsareforgods

<RenegadeBrony>: Respect the mods, they are dedicating their time to bring fellow bronies this stream, which they don't have to do in the first place.
Lyraaaaa. Oh. And Trixie too. :|
i dont look at names a lot
Then
0wat, newdcd? just... post it?

1000 years AGO
And that's how Equestia ended.
equestria reborn
...and started back up again
Of course, she resetted it like nothing happened.

Derpyquest would be Derpy's quest to get the southern birds
Thats what happened 100 years ago...

Why does Princess Trollestia Want to destroy the world AND Redo it?

Celestia blows up Earth. Sends Luna to the moon. Recreates Earth as Equestria.
Just how luna got sent to the moon

Gettting a free .com domain is harder than getting .co.cc
okkay
hm
it just keeps going!
bloody 1am, confound these ponies, they drive me to nocturnality
6Probably, Potatojack
Can I make the Announcments for tomorrow after this?
can we watch ep 25 timirrow beore saving rpivate ryan
annnnnnnnnnd mute
6lol nope
k
try now
6That was to Lolipop
OH
Connection to Steam servers successful.
VAC secure mode is activated.
another long movie tomorrow
Damn
if you have to get something besides .com, that's fine
7It works. :D
probably won't watch it cause I'm in gmt+1 and going on vacation on monday
6But if I'm going to play eps, at all, it'll be the ones from this week.
10TTEchidna can you see if Darkeiya can come on?
0GMT+1 brohoof Errannar
Oh and you meant to say nope.avi
Yes, this is good for closing time.
brohoof Bjornfot
7Is it password-protected? O_o
6No, no I did not.
Damn x2
;o
supposedly
sax spike is trance inducing
I see you
and uh
I might have to close the server briefly
We still need a ponified "It's Friday Night!"
.cc.co domain seems the easiest to get for free.
Spike has strong lungs.
Preferably with ponies of us.
:p
7Eh, that's all right.
so I can run it via screen or something
7Testing a bit for today.
ah okay
Ponies of us?
let me exit it for a bit
I already have an OC, actually
Someone from Ponychan made me one
That's what I'm saying.
what's the emote tag for chat, /e?
Our OCs.
/me
ah, thanks
Most of us have one.
We could ask Bling, he's the one who made me mine
installing screen atm
7Mmm'kay.
How many more minutes?
derp
6 2
Fifty-five
oh lordy
.com seems to usually be free for just a year.
Damn x3
6I wonder if this is on loop.
6It is our new "closing time" music. :p
YES

noooo
That's not a bad idea.
wow, stupid typo's
Only for this month. K?
fluttershy's lulaby for 10 minutes should be the closing
6Probably only for a short while.
6We'll probably shift around.
6LOLOOP
7I will be going to sleep soon.
I can't stop watching for some reason.
ahahaa
alright

7If you want to put a note on the TF2 topic on TST it's up.

uh
If you see that Bubble box thing
0I'm enjoying this.
On the down on the video
4I for one love our new "closing time" music
You have been watching Late Night Brony State, sponsored by the Quill & Sofa Store.
It means its looping
7And no password, or am I missing something?
Wheres the Announcments?
6No closing announcements tonight.
6Nothing of any significant importance.
okay.jpg
uh
let me check
..
6Other than that we're showing Saving Private Ryan tomorrow at 8 PM EST.
6this is making me want to play TF2 again today
7Lol.
never played it
In honnor of July 4th
0well, see you all then
*Honor
03I refuse to play it on concept
7Thank you for setting a server though. :)
apparently hl2 which I assume is half life 2
is also there
03because ew highly addicting games
0*honour
4I know I'm late, but, *points to Potatojack* I like that idea
12lol
7Well, the engine.
Mostly .com, .net and the like are only free for a year, after which you have to renew by paying, or redo surveys and offers, etc, you did to get the domain in the first place.
.cc.co should just be free permenantly with no input required.
This is bront state, and we are OUT!
Spike's bulge still disturbs me....
*Brony
Huh, I wonder what the other guys think then
uh
I honestly don't care, it's not like we should have any issue with it being .cc.co
7Okay,.
What are they using to record?
damnit SSH, stop lagging
I honestly don't care either.
bront > brontosaurus > my prehistoric pony?
if it works, it works.
Fine I'll get that.
Hmm.
For hosting there's one with 1.5 GB disk space and 100GB/month data transfer for free.
try it?
7Okay.
7Last time before I sleep for the night. :)
That's not bad, for the purpose we'd be using it for.
Got the email
Awesome, I'm glad they took down the logo
It'd also come with 5 email accounts.
this tune is so relaxing
no password still?
unless rcon_password is the admin password
We don't really need email accounts, but that's cool I suppose.
I thought I was joking when I said it goes for 55 more minutes.
this is the song that never ends
6It's on loop, so technically it never ends.
yes it goes on and on my friend
6But it's only 10 minutes long.
just gonna throw this out there: The world needs more RBDxVinyl Scratch and/or OctaviaxVinyl Sctratch shipfics. H8rz feel free to h8.

needs more luna
ah
rcon_password is the admin password
6Yeah, once this vid finishes.
right, so, I'll set that as something more secure
and give it to you
0>once it finishes
0>it loops
0TROOLOLOLOLOLOLO
and yeah it's sv_password
6:D
no bar
must have missed that
Lulz at the Vinyl Scratch Tapes. I read them all last night.
"technically it never ends" -> "once this vid finishes"
7All right.
well be here for a million years
Nittany_Tiger, me gusta mucho
7I'll give it one more try, then.
6FOREEEEVER!
yeah let me configure it
0i'm gonna listen to this aaaaaaaaaaaaaall night
forever!
It will keep playing until tomorrow night's movie.
I wonder if Vinyl is really like she is in the fanfic, though.
he's pulling a pinkie pie on us
naw
well technically Vinyl is completely undefined
ooo
D'oh!
4Thanks for coming guys
6Well, that's all folks.
I think that's why she makes such a good fanfic character
0NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
4We hope to see you tomorrow! :D
So far we have to guess what Vinyl is like.
0@Ghosties that's what she said
yay! i bean boo!
mean
had fun
6You don't have to go home, but... well, I guess you can stay here as long as you're not causing trouble.
k guys, this was fun
Cheers for the streaming Sprinks as always, and thanks mods <3 I'll be hitting the hay
4Shame on SirSprinkles
4He used my saying
time for cuddles!
Orgy tiem?
0oh gawd
6And we'll KNOW if you caused trouble, so seriously, don't.
can... can i used colored text once before I leave?
0inb4 bronypile
6If you want to be kicked for it. :p
Closing time, one last call for alchol, so finish your whiskey or beer
alright, gonna restart, Quan
andytags: I usually turn off the coolour script when pretty much everyone has left.
colour*
I think Vinyl is somewhat less than that
in the Fanfic.
0Well, at least if I don't get banned.
0like IP banned
Whatcha running on :P
I'll be hitting the hay as well, good night (well, morning in my case :/)
does screen exist on windows? no
time for after dark
0:P
Well you can see a window screen :p
BMN After Dark?

Meow
hi
4God, now I have to go listen to Summoning
im using my Cats wifi
4Hi :3
0>his cat has wifi
4Wut
To all who desperately want to use coloured text, it's probably best that you just don't, even when the stream isn't bustling, it's just a good practice to uphold the rules of the stream even when it's not entirely necessary
0pills here
0talk about spoiling your pet
Yes
color is overrated
They reset at the end of each month
Lawful Good allignment?
I have screenshots of the old ones

Personally I'm not bothered if you guys post colours now, since the stream is over, take it up with Sprinkles. :P

12ok
4Hey!
Ponify me
4You should be taking it up with me!
Lawl.
6I don't really care, as long as you're not using colors of mods that are currently in the stream.
4I was the original mod after all
6i.e. Red
4Hey, Sprinks, do you remember the good ol days?
13SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
6I do.
4Sol: Bronypeanut uses pink
i was a mod of a huge gaming server once
03in that case, pix or gtfo
/me runs
4But man, those were the days. We'd have some new person come into the barren room and I'd say
4YOU!
night Quan
4I AM YOUR GOD HERE!
Heheh.
seeya
4Man, I miss those days
Superseded by mods... damn. Well, I'd still say it's silly to use colours at all at any time if you're not a mod, but that's just silly old rainbrodash talking :P
6You mean like, a month ago? XD
IS there any color any mod doesn't use?
I'm a mod of a forum.
4Exactly, the good ol days lol
6There are some colors.
BROADCAST THE STREAM AGAIN
6Not many though.
A mod with a banstick (not all mods get bansticks on this forum).
use black text
SHOW AFTER DARK
k
6Well, I'm off. I hunger for food.
4No pix for u
It gets used extensively on adbots and spambots.
I'm not sure if my internet is good enough to stream for you guys. :P
03:<
6And more cigarettes...
I can stream to my laptop next door though.
XD
4You'd be surprised
Cya later then Sprinkles.
4Alright Sprinks. Have a good night, man
6cya
Actually, I use ban llamas.
yeah night sprinks
Later Sprinkly

12Hello Hooh
4Hi!
holy.shit.
Uh, May, what are you using to download the torrent?
14Vuze
:o
14I use it mostly for downloading animes to watch
10This colour makes me wanna puke.
o:
EW
Vuze lags like crap
use bittorrent
night
it took me nearly two weeks to download KH1's iso of 2.83GB using VUZE
the max speed was 12kbps
lolfail
I'll never trust Sprinkles with colors again ><
14uhm
14okay
14I'll get that then
derp
:o:
12herp
12;o
4derp

4herr
4I just ate a klondike bar o3o
10hey
03EW THAT FACE
/care
03Why is it that new people just randomly come in here and use it
12D: I want one
03is someone brainwashing our members? :/
ITS AFTER DARK SHOW PONIES
Howdy~
12It's Kyu!
rofl
/me runs
drf
if we were using inspircd
woop woop
we could configure it so that o3o = o.o
03yeah
except I HATE inspircd
03YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO MAKE THAT PUBLIC FFS
10so
and that crap takes me half an hour to configure
You can try and bug DCD to stream something. :P
XD
10i guess it's just as who is here
10ok so lets start
Alright.
10How often do we want meetings?
10Like this
4I'm doubletasking like crazy
10once a month every two weeks? what?
4*multitasking
I'm re-watching pony episodes right now. I'm fine.
yeah and really, everyone cares :3
I'd be fine with once every two weeks. Frankly, most any time is good.
At least, for me.
10ok
A went to B then went to C then to D then to E and F and G
10Same here
I could stream stuff if I asked DCD for the details.
Guys...um...I got a problem...
How do I embed the stream into here?
10what day?
10also time
I redid the site, but it's missing the stream.
I just have the chat.
10if i have something i need to do most of the time i'm back 4 to 7 pm your time
I'll get you the link.
4Lol
Any time past 7pm is good for me on most days.
10Just to let you you don't have to be there
10ok
I tend to be on during the day as well, but schedules tend to shift around a lot, y'know?
<script type="text/javascript"> fid="BronyState"; v_width="700"; v_height="520";</script>
10yes
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://veemi.com/javascript/embedPlayer.js"></script>
<iframe width="700" height="520" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" src="http://www.veemi.com/embed.php?v=BronyState&amp;vw=700&amp;vh=520&amp;domain=www.dinkypage.com"></iframe>
I think that's it.
10how about next weekend?
IT WORKS!
*saves*
10Also can you get rid of this? http://www.spyropedia.com/wiki/File:Cynder.jpg
10it's the cynder jpg
I should be available then, and sure thing.
10not teh small but the cynder.jpg
Yeah.
10*the
10ok next
10pages that we need/keep/delete
...there's two of them.
That code you gave me gives me two of the same stream. XD
Elaborate a little, please?
Dunno then, I just took that from the source of the old page.
10ok we are gonig to go over stuff we need or we have to keep or we can get rid of
Ah, okay.
Can we get rid of Cynder?
Okay.
Will do.
Josh. :|
10you mean the page?
Oh wait Vivendi already killed her.
10no
Just like they killed Elora.
10it was an image
Ignore him. He's being an idiot.
10kk
VIVENDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Alright, pages we need.
10Contact Us/staff
10we need that
Yes.
Contact with our staff.
That's inappropriate.
10>.>
I'm trying to think of ways to redesign the main page.
10ok so staff our
But I need GRAFFIXS
10*are
12bbl
I know Uxie was attempting to write up a Manual of Style, too.
10Well we can do that when we can get a hold of her
10so thats our staff
10Next do we want fanon/fandom/fanfics?
I'd personally try to avoid fanon and fanfiction, since then we'll have any random shmuck coming in to advertise their fanfic.
10ok
Fandom... I'm a little iffy about. An article on fandom in general *might* be alright, but it'd be a matter of trying to figure out how to handle it.
I'd say for the moment, we'll leave that be and get back to it later.
10ok
10Featured Articles
10we neeed to run this
10Like run this good
10So FA should be for good pages
10That are not stubs or stuff like that
Yeah.
Oh featured articles.
How I loathe you.
10>.>
10I think we can get some good pages up there
Because then what ends up happening anywhere but Wikipedia is that there's never enough good articles.
10also it needs a good image to be a FA
Good image?
From a PS1 game?
10i png file
10and not fanon
10and try for a full shot
No Spyro was never on PS2. There was one beta game that never made it out of development, and then the series ended.
10no like a pic of their head
Yeah.
10Also is TTE ok?
What we need is to fix up the game articles, too...
10Well yes
And am I okay?
OF COUUUUURSE
10But we need a MoS
10so we know what we are doing
10So we have a guideline
My sarcasm is evident though. BECAAAAAUSE I blame Vivendi for everything.
Bastards. Greedy corporate bastards.
Same with Craptivision.
I told you, Josh, enough of that bullshit.
NEVAR
Either get with the program or shut the fuck up.
Now, back to the actual topic at hand instead of your childish ranting...
4Bye!
Yes. A Manual of Style will definitely be necessary.
What would we put in the MoS, though, aside from "don't fail at grammar"?
10>.>
10How a page should look and what it should have
Same issue we encountered at Bulbapedia. There's no real... anything.
It all depends on the page itself.
10Right
10We should have different stuff for the different pages their are
10like maybe story and history for the characters
Maybe.
I'm also vouching for quotes (or at least, any text box dialogue).
10Yes we should have that
Now THOSE...
Quotes...
I can make a template for.
Make it in the style of Spyro 2/3 boxes.
10http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page this is where i come from
Because AHT's were lame, Spyro 1's had UNREADABLE FONT...
10and it works
10>.>
10Anyways before it went down we were doing good
...get that picture of Bentley off there. That's not Bentley.
Josh, enough.
But it's not.
Looks more like Robin Williams.
I've got more reason to have my heart sink at that than you do, but even I can suck it up and focus on the important.
wb
more like sheila can suck it up
*snicker*
>:|
EITHER WAY
:D
10http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Gallery:Jupiter_Dragon_Traps pages like this
10This good page
10It shows what the enemy looks like
10it also has their attacks and them sleeping
True.
That could be doable in one of those enemy tables you were thinking of, right?
14thanks :>
Like, maybe have a parameter.
/me freezes
I suppose.
10it really shows how they look and act
/me defrosts
10Also how you die
O good. My electricity came back on. People are still here?
(Also also, does anyone have a problem if I delete the Timeline article?)
4Did Articuno use Sheer Cold on you?
But remember, we shouldn't attempt to be something we're not. And what we'd be is informative, not an excuse not to play the games...
nice banner, btw
Timeline?
There's three.
10not really
Maybe four.
Kill it.
10If we have to we can do it again
10http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Dragon_Eggs
10So for the most part i did that
And... why's it a Jupiter Dragon Trap... I mean. Was that name officially used?
10i'm not really sure
10I think Uxie knows more
I know after EtD that Vivendi laid on the bad puns thick...
!pokemon
:O
10I just get the pics and text
PS2 emulator?
10no
10Gamecube

Hooh54, you are a 7Jumpluff.
OHWOW
10MY PS2 emu lags to much
4Pluff buff
Also, that is a fantastic Dragon Egg article.
haha
10Thanks
10See this is what i am aming for
and how is me being a Lugia ironic, HML?
what, Hooh54?
10That is the type of page we need
4You got Lugia
lol
Yes.
I can already say, in terms of needed information...
10http://www.spyropedia.com/wiki/Zoe_%28Fairy%29 not this
10Weird how it adds the %
%28 is the code for a parenthesis, I think.
Either way, I concur whole-heartedly. I've been meaning to add more to her article.
4The only good Pokemon I ever got was Espeon
lol
heya Umbreon ;p
10same
12it feels odd to have a usb keyboard for a laptop
12XD
._.
yeah I imagine it would
XD
4.-.
10I mean that right there is not what we want
Yeah.
...hmm, GCN emulator?
but hey, I love my laptop's keyboard
12i think it's odd enough my friends use a usb mouse for their laptops
Run from GCN discs or what?
I hate USB mouses
12it's so hard to type messages
12when your spacebar and E keys fail on you
10no
Because I got the PS1 Spyro screens straight off my own copies of Spyro 1, 2, and 3.
4tRUE
10I got the file
4*True
10:)
Ah.
12allyourmssagscomoutlikthis
10ok so Darkeiya lets starts a test run
Well, like I care. AHT was developed on the GCN anyway, which is why they fucked up and flipped Flame/Charge in the PS2 version.
Probably because the GCN version of EtD crashed less.
XD
Hmm...
10ok we have seen both egg pages
Any of you guys have Dropbox?
!chatstats
Chat stats updating.
Or have I already pushed it on you?
4allyourmessagesarebelongtousb
!pokemon
Alright, the Egg page.
4XD
lol
10i don't even know what that is
honestly
4Geodudette
10lets try a test on fusing them into one
Man, the amount of people who try too hard...
tl;dr Dropbox is a file-sharing system.
10http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Dragon_Eggs http://www.spyropedia.com/wiki/Dragon_Eggs
Alright.
10oh ok
10ok so from what i can see
10Spyropedia has about the same info as shout
!pokemon
!digimon
Just not extended into a walkthrough.
I'll merge the text to my best, anyway.
Gimme a few minutes.
10now i like your guys pic at the top right better then ours
Dragon egg locations, likely should be on their own pages.
12LOL
4!digimon
Hooh54, you are a 6IceLeomon.
10Just go to edit then cop and paste and we can do the images
List of dragon eggs in Spyro: Year of the Dragon, etc.
12this works i just laid the keyboard over the laptop keyboard
Nah, separate pages.
Categorized as Lists of collectibles.
10Like List of Spyro: A hero's tail Eggs
10maybe add a /
That's actually what we were going to do for the later ones. List of Dragons in Spyro: Year of the Dragon and so on.
Might be Dragon Eggs. Hm.
Well.
Regardless.
10ok
List of (x) in (y), (x) being the item, (y) being the game.
10yea that would work
(x) being times you can touch Bianca's boobs, (y) being when you're playing as Hunter.
This category is empty.
10>.>
10......
Scuba diving.
ANYWAY I'm gonna make a game template.
10ok for?
See you all later.
03what keyboard o.o
...games...
o_O i got nickalerted. who mentioned me D:
I see.'
10Darkeiya would it be ok for us to add http://crashbandicoot.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page as a External Page
12drf
12the usb keyboard i got
12to replace the laptop keyboard that was dying on me?
Hmmm...
As an external page where?
10ok theres spyro spyro 2 3 ETD AHT SL Legend's and the new skylanders and the spinoff's
10well see they link to Crash
10And a EX page from us spyropedia to them
03yeah
yes Hooh54?
10For the spinoff's theirs season of ice and Flame the fusion and AOTR
lol
I noticed
Yeah, I know all the games... and the consoles they're on.
!pokemon
!digimon
10ok good
wat
>|
4Cerberumon is actually pretty cool
12so yes exactly drf
12i was having some space issues
10also to note me or Uxie can't edit the main page as it's locked
12but i guess just laying it over the laptop keyboard is working very nicely
Of course.
Otherwise anyone could just edit it.
10brb
Hey guys what time is the movie tomorrow?
I'm gonna include parameters for several boxart images...
That way it can cycle through them,
Okay.
0 8 30
4Goodnight!
Hello my bronies.

I will take that as a yes.
0yes youhave
night all
Alright. I believe I've managed to merge the pages.

Yeah.

03I have a feeling that wouldn't end well

03"bad fanfiction" is redundant
/me hides

Haha, I still remember it.
12Ah, who was your favorite dragon you remember?
Hmm, I can't really remember my favourite, I think it might have been the thunder one (don't remember the name), but Chibi and the long dragon that could discintergrate were both awesome as well.

12Can anyone who hasn't logged into the art gallery for over a week, please go there now and see if you're logged in..?
06It is a bit laggy but t works nicely x3
12LoL

06Oh, spoke about the tf2 server xD
brb going home
06lol, anyone else disconnected? xD
04:\
04Yep
06I guess it doesn't like me changing map :B
04lol
06lol yeah it crashed o.O
04Well NS disappeared so :|
06hmm
0664.37.49.28:27015
06WAIT
06wrong one
06^
06yeah but I think it crashed when I tried to change map o.o
04Damnit
04since I downloaded TF2, I only have about 600M left on my computer
04So a message keeps coming up "You are running on low disk space"
06o.o how much space do you have on it in total anyway?
06i can host one, for when i'm online
06that means for now
04only about 70-80GB
06Could try to join me right now, doing what visimar did :P
06and oh my >-<
04yah
04I need an external hardrive larger than 16G >.>
06And late @Arti - I'm still logged in and I haven't been there in over a week o.o
06hehe
06hey Xeli
06i'll host one for now....
06but i need the cmd to disable lan only
06Sure, put a super-fast-paced map like koth_lakeside_final
06and it's sv_lan, then change map
06sv_lan 0*
06ok
04I have no idea what was just said
06and changing map in-game?
06map <mapname>
06ok

04would plugging in a headset into the headphones port of a PC work?

06x3
06Xeli

04fuuuuuu
04my headset doesn't fit
06... must... resist... jokes
04Probably because it's for the 360 BUT THAT'S IRRELEVANT
04lol
06tsk
04Also I can't add you as a friend because of stupid Steam rules about buying things
06and Darky are you doing it through just create game or source dedicated server?
06lol what o.O
04Apparently
04I can't add friends myself until I buy something
04to stop trolls and phishers and spammers
04which is fair enough
04Others can add me, I just can't add them

Hello guys
hey apok, hows it going?
pretty good
I see you're still here
instead of being productive so I don't have to be
heh
2anyone give me three random pokemon that would make a good team (two PKMN is ok)
I was very productive
I played Terraria
/me shot
soo productive ;D
You bet
fuck you rainbro
2ok :)
Fuck you too man :)
2meh, what kind of name could ateam like that have???
:)
2*a team
If you guys want to do that, you should go get a room, I don't want to see this. :P
Hey Apok. Yes I was productive, btw. Finally gave myself a big enough kick in the flank to start the writing process on my first fanfic that's been trotting in the spotlight of my brain since Mid-May.
so what is this?
Nice
*cough* Conversion Bureau stuff.
Dari you love it. I bet mod chat is just full of cyb0r anyway ;)
Ohai Silver
ohai silver
hi silver
silver just came back from mod cyb0r
:D
Shh, you're not supposed to know about that.
11what?
8o hai silver
11hello
ohai Hipster
I mean, hi Silver
hehe
7Hmm... Gengar, Latios, and DW Blaziken? :P
11Hi, Dermathil
2lawl, meh, not Latios (seen too much of him X.X)
7Eh, all right.
7Gengar is fun in 3 on 3s with fast attacks and Destiny Bond.
7Even better if you hack a Custap berry on it.
2i had 2 triple battles on random match
12Hi gotta go in two mins but is there anyone here that had problem with the gallery lagging due to the random pics slider at the top?
2after using dark void, one disconnected
7Ah.
2the other just switched the 3 sleeping PKMN
7Whimsicott + Terrakion.
7Or Weavile + Terrakion.
7Or Houndoom + Terrakion. :P
2well, i haven't been to the gallery so....................
12Yeh... anyone that has??
12If so, PM me if it's still lagging or not, gtg
7ARTI
7Wait:
The best change Silver made by far is centering everything
7I apparently don't have moderator access to the galleries?
/me snugs in articuno's tail
having the site lopsided to the left bothered me
^I second that
I'm serious
06o.o
11Centering is good for keeping things in order, but if it's used for everything, it can change from looking good to barely readable. Though that's mainly when it comes to text.
Fun o.o
yeah, there isn't much text on this site
so it works
2anywayz, after he switched, they also fell asleep (DV) and one got paralyzed. THAT'S when he disconnected
2sore losers >:<

11Chocolate Pancakes?

Thanks

no u
While chat isn't too crowded, is there any plan to stream new episodes next season here?
8yes
8we will be streaming new episodes live
That's awesome
:D
2Osha-what???
I love the redesign for this site
will be epic
and yeah tyranico, silver did it today :D
Well he did a great job :)
12Oshawott
/me runs
/me 2chases
I like the redesign a lot.
Its pretty good
8yes, thank Silverscreen for the awesome redesign
11You're welcome.
So have any official release dates been revealed for season 2?
nope
Oh yeah and cool redesign Silverscreen
11nothing other than what we already know.
I would assume it would be about the same time as last year, but if that was the case they probably would have told us already
since theres really only like 3 months left
thoughts?
8i doubt we will hear any definitive release dates until near the end of summer
8i dont even think they have the first episode of the season completely done yet
But there has been a private showing of the first episode to a family member of (I think) a lead animator/director/someone important
(not disagreeing with you hipster, im sure it wasn't 100% complete too, just saying)
tl;dr ALL IS HOPEFUL
the director showed it to his daughter.
I heard about that
^that
yeah what RBD said
/me is bored
13Espeon tails are so difficult for me to draw these days ;;
02.-.
13and hai Ray xD
12It's like two Mew tails
/me 2smacks Ray with an Espeon's tail
11...I have to make a Steam account to get TF2
/me 11signs up for Steam BMN in that case. :D
BMN?
Silver I'm a massive noob at TF2, we should play sometime
06o.o

I'm only good at valve ones
speaking of which
11Wait, is TF2 FPS or Third person?
I wonder if I can finish my hl2 playthrough before dinner
@elision sick. @Silverscreen I'm a console fps player, so I'm bloody horrible at PC fps
@silver it's 1st person
11ah.
1.8 hours from start to highway 17 feels pretty good
11Elision: wat?
silver he's talking about halflife 2 :P
I'm semispeedrunning hl2

/me is listing to: Kalafina - Magia

So do you guys have any way of tracking exactly how many people tune in on fridays?
Look at the top of the chat.

uMad

/me 11is a genius.
Sooo since there's pretty much nobody here can I have diplomatic immunity and post something in color :3
NEVAR
I don't mind if people post colours now, ask the other mods.
RainBroDash: :<

TehDavies is me
by the way
11lol
11"You have 1 New friend invite. WOW you're popular!
xD
I'm Elision on steam
my id is mustelide
I didn't think that was a reason to be kicked :/
wrong smiley:(
op abuse: yopu're doing it right
11Outside of regular BMN, we kick as we please, usually out of fun.
grrr
11grr :P
actually I cant blame you. I would probably do the same.
11Like I said, it's all in good fun, though.
11Nothing meant by it.
So I'm guessing thats a no on the color thing:P
11Try it. >: )
mmmm
0THE TEMPTATION IS UNBEARABLE!!!!
8We kick for the enjoyment we anticipate experiencing after performing said activity sometimes
11What hipster said.
8if we're kicking you for cause, we make it clear in the kick message
15*wince
11....that's grey. Technically, Grey isn't a color. It's a shade.
12*wince again
11I used to use that color. Most people said it was hard to read though.
it was :P
especially for those mammoth paragraphs of trivia
I'm back~
ARGH
but for some reason I also think that colour suits you more..
I forgot how redtardly annoying this bridge was
11Thank you.
´sup everyponie
hey colgate
11Allo, Colgate.
Anything fun going on`?
oh hey colgate
11I'm abusing my mod powers again.
silverscreen just got TF2, and I'm trying to make an oc pony. elision's playing HL2 and that's about it
0I told a friend I was a brony and he did NOT like
0and what silverscren said
^ been there, done that >.<
and I'm playing GT5
You should slap him with love and tolerance
11How about I slap YOU?!
:D
and you briefly sent me into a minor panic because I thought I'd lost my colgate+twilight but they were right by my computer
02Wb Silbah, Hiya Drake
04Why hello
A few days ago I forced a friend of mine to watch MLP FIN, because he was nagging on me all the time for being weird
8oh silver
8i meant to ask
He´s on the 19th episode now I think
/me 2is sleepy~
0ha
ahaha colgate, success!
ohai Drake~
lol
2o hai thare
Colgate which episode did you show him?
nice
The first two
11Yesh, hipster?
8whats the deal with the random links to the homepage on the homepage?
We made a deal, he made me watch an awful movie, and I made him watch an "awful" movie
Heya Drake
8the words "win" and "offers" are randomly links
04Hello HML
lol
oh yeah saw that
i lol'd at BronyState being win though
Wow...that's odd.
8#winning
0hmm
>:U
I just fell off the same part of the road twice in a row
derp
oh wow. XD
herpaderp
It's because of my browser
join #bronystaterequests
came really cloe to a third time
whoops
that didn't work
heh
O_o
Derp
We have this channel?
o.o
wat
yeah
oh i c
0what should I say to my pony-hating friend
it was for video requests last night
Ahh.
and when ponychan was down on friday
i have no idea anon
8dunno, anon, i wish i knew
11That it's better than the majority of animated crap that's on TV now adays.
I've been in that situation it's hard
8i tried to convert my best friend, he didnt bite
:(
About that, I have another friend, who is really tricky, who begged me to stop after I mentioned MLP. I want to convert him!
8only watched 5 mins of fall weather friends before turning it off
lol
Nono you have to start with the first episode
0He is under the /b/ induced impression that all bronies are gay. and pedophiles.
oops
I got stuck in a garage door :(
I'm trying to get my sister and her husband to watch an episode.
>/b/. >call people pedophiles
wat
8i wanted to start with the least "girly" episode
8lol rainbro
Don't know how to go about it though.
I think that the first episode is the best converting one
Hmm, which episode is the most violent?
I mean most of this fandom started watching the first episode
I think that because spike steals the limelight from twilight quite a bit, it makes the first one less girly
0I watched the first first. and so on.
and thus more bearable
The first one is important, it introduces the characters
8me too, i started with the pilot
If you show them any of the other ones, they might get confused
11Same here
And confusion leads to dislike
I started with Ep. 5, but that was after I had seen a few mashups already. It was the mashups caught my eye initally.
11Anyway, those link derps on the home site is because I use Google Chrome for my browser, and it does these stupid advertisement links in text.
Specifically Reservior Ponies
0true. I just thought it was odd that someone who hangs out on /b/ was calling me a pedo.
I remember how MLP caught my attention, feels like nostalgia already
12Hey Drake
Ep. 25*
plus it gives them an opportunity to get a 'favourite' pony, since they all get good screentime, and they all show off their character stereotypes strongly. Hence my loving of the RBD raincloud moment, and the RBD falling-over-laughing moment
I think the pilot is a good idea
11It's been fixed.
:3
I remember lurking on /co/ in early January and seeing MLP related stuff for the first time. I now wish I would have started watching then.
I´m on a lot of art sites, and when new "fads" start I usually dont care, but what struck me with all the MLP fanart and fanfiction was that there was so little porn! The majority of the fanstuff is clean o0
0I started with the pilot after seeing one clip. It was the "return of Derpy" thing.
12:)
:D
11Colgate: Obviously you aren't a furry.
0Are you
yeah I've come across a lot of porn
11Yeah.
0silver?
I do enjoy adult art from time to time, but I find it sad when shows and characters get butchered with mindless porn
11Childhood rape. It's what the furry fandom's best known for. : \
This is the first series that has got me into fanfiction
So seeing all the clean mlp art made me go ´wut´and it restored some of my faith in humanity
0true. I'm 2% me, 23% furry, and 75% brony.
0roughly speaking
I am a furry though, even if I dont apply the term to myself I think I count as one
0I think the bronys represent the more reasonable side of the furry fandom.
i would like to think of an appropriate cutie mark for my OC pony but I can't think of onee D: D: this is infuriating.
0What is your oc like
it's RainBroDash in its entirety: here's the beta of it:
oh?
12!Pokemon
http://imgur.com/vA0Vj
12Yay
hey Dman
you lurker you
Hahaha
Nice
wow, nice male rainbowdash : )
Cute
!pokemon
0ha. Ummm... Well obviously something very similar to RDs mark.
The cutie mark should be like Dash´s but with the cloud formed like balls
0but more male
does the movie start in an hour and 20 mins?
cheers dude, it's for my online rainbrodash identity, I might as well have a display picture to go with it
0^do it
LOL COLGATE
xD
11I'm a furry and I'm not afraid to admit I enjoy some of the more adult aspects of the fandom, but I prefer the clean art and stories that come out of it, which is pretty damn good if you give it a look.
0^true
I like a lot of clean art, like D'aww art and shtuff :3
^fanfics for FiM are amazing
^seconded
^
I´ve read about half of the cupcakes fanfic
dman yeah 1hr 15 mins dude
11The D'aww art's been through the roof since MLP started.
12!pokemon
Lati, you are a 7Bronzor.
Dammit!
12NOoooo
0I think its a place for creative people to express themselves without being ridiculed by society for being gifferent
same Silverscreen
Umm, but "Sweet Appple Massacre" and "The Horror, Thr Horror" are just terrible...
but anyway
does this start in a little over an hour?
suddenly, rain, thousands of it
yes dman
12Today I got a Snivy TCG card with my happy meal, along with a Pikachu toy :3
K
11Elision: You live near the US's East coast?
seriously big thunderstorm here inmaryland
11ah
hope I don't lose internet
11You're getting the storm that just passed over me.
D:
12Lucky you, wish our mc donalds had Pokémon toys ;w;
0its sunny and hot as fuck here.
dodge all the rains
So guys, I need your votes. I´m going to draw a pony now, cuz I feel like it, but you get to choose wich one, only from the main cast though!
So shoot
it's nighttime as fuck here
very hot, but night here
lol yup
11Gotta draw Luna
Friend of mine is South Carolina says there's a big thunderstorm there too. Is this all over the East Coast?
why main only?
0 101?
11There can never be enough LUna art.
mane six?
I`m still practicing
NEVER
colgate, it has to be........................ colgate
0degrees
On another note, I am currently writing my very first fanfic.
Orion
8it was 97 and sunny here today /trollface

12IOh yeah, they're not doing that where you live ; ;
I'm working on a kinetic typography version of fuck shit stack.
11Hello, Gabe.

Hi
0Hipster where u at
Colgate´s no fun though, to be honest x3
12oh well ~
With fluttershy, of course.
maxaminusone that would make my life complete
12what else have you got from there? :3
11Speaking of Gabe... *goes back to working on his Steam Account*
mane six --> dashie, speaking role --> luna, bg pony --> lyra
12I-
8Ohio, anon
0TEXAS
or bon-bon they're both fun to draw
0proly why my friend hates ponys
lmao Happy meals XD
Love and tolerance ot him!
/me is lovin' it
>tolerance him
Happy meals enrage me
Tolerate >_<
0I live in a socially backwards racist small town that I hate.
/me 11doesn't have a favorite BG pony...
You must.... Love and tolerate it!
Silverscreen, it's ok, me neither
12Well, last time I went I found a Audino card just laying on the floor XD
silverscreen's favourite background pony is Vinyl Scratch
I needs moar thunder
My fav bg pony happened to be Colgate, hehe
I am a big fan of colgate actually :<
/me doesn't either
/me finds the Jetpack song from Kick-Ass to listen to while he writes the prologue to his first fanfic.
Since I wanted to make a facebook pony but all was taken cept´for Colgate
11lol, Dermathil
Colgate: I got a colgate custom at bronycon in fact :D
Ahh-dee-no
So yeah, there I revealed where I lurk during the days
Or something
Best ponies: DJ pony, Rainbow pony, Colgate pony.
fav bg pony is Derpy
DJ Pon-3?
vinyl scratch and octavia also have nice designs to draw
fav speaking role is Zecora
Zecora, man
12It was in perfect conduction too o-o
ooh draw the wonderbolts Colgate
vinyl scratchxOctavia is like my favourite ship at the moment O_O
And the bronies, hang out too! Cause´ they know we´re awesome fillies!
12condition*
0my fav bg is... prolly spitfire with derpy and dj pon3 tied for second
Rainbrodash, is that form that fanfic?
vinyl scratch tapes?
I think so
Yes actually
0^lol
First I want to get the anatomy straight Elision
I haven't read it, but it ships them rite?
tis a good fanfic dman yeah
lol
I read one ... called i'd have to look it up
So I´m just going to draw standalone pics of the mane cast for now
Yes, Zecora is fav speaking role
12whoa nice catch
but it ships Dashie and Vinyl
/me 11ships AJ with a random male pony from Appleoosa.
04I have 74MG of unused space remaining
And it was so well written I can't get it outta my head D:
Green Grapes?
0Today tomorrow, and forever.... just gonna throw that out
/me 8isn't a fan of shipping
Even thou I consider Dash to be straight...for the moment
UGH I've read so much DashxVinyl, BUT I NEED MORE
12It also came with a small chat showing everycard you can get there :3
MOAAR
lolnoooooo
12chart*
no shipping >_<
12extra nice! XD
0Today tomorrow, and forever
I only like shipping if it's built up well enough
11I prefer DashxSpitfire.
dman uJelly of my homoponies? :3
12It's about time mc donalds started making decent-ish toys again
FUCK YES silver!
I've once read a shipping fic. Wasn't too bad actually
As far as shipping goes, I prefer FedEx
fav mane 6: all of em. They've ALL grown on me alot. especially Rarity.
RainBroDash / other fans of shipping /NOT Hipster_brony: You guys will never see season 2 normally D:
Dash could be bisexual for all we know
12Indeed
0She is
Fave Mane poney is Random Poney
Prove it >_<
0its been proven somewhere
*Pony
11Canonly speaking, I believe all the ponies are straight.
^^
same silverscreen
dark fics have a much bigger effect on me than shipping
@dman ever since I learned the stars were giant balls of gas thousands of years back in time, it just made them more beautiful to me :)
Apokalipse, then did you read the pony psychology series?
um, what's that got to do with this rainbrodash? I'm a confused little pony rite now
not yet
/me 8is thinking of how Whelp would be posting a link to the Kinsey Scale if he were here
11I figure Fanfics as big "What if" Situations.
Although, by scientific fact there is a larger chance of the pony girls in Equestria to be homo than in our society
EEeeyup
I read Severing
^^ true
and yeah silverscreen same. especially since of course not all fanfics correlate
0Faust openly stated there was no canon for dash being straight until they needed it, and there wont be so dash is free to be gay/bi.
FFF I meants Silver's last line is true
anypony read the pony psychology fanfics?
Dman, I read it
lul#
0no
and loved it
0are they good
yea, well, it was good
Nope
Look here, since girls are a large majority of the Equestrian population, it is more likely there will be more lesbians than in for example our society
They are excellent. There may be slight shipping in it but it actually helps the story.
I have a big to read list
It makes out dash to be bi, AJ and fluttershy to be lesbians and ships them both with dash
dman what I mean is, I can still observe season 2 as it is, but having a bit of extra information (true or not true) might make it just a teeency bit even more interesting
baaasically
the pony psychology series was good but I didn't like the ending
Dman, there's more to it than that.
Ofc, Rainbrodash, my bro, that's what I want too
yea i guess dermathil
the elements thing
0While we're talking about fanfics
and Twilight becoming immorta
l
Elision: did you read the alicorn chapter that came out more recently?
I haven't D: is it good?
yes
The story sorta ended, so I didn't read it
About Celly and Luna
oh
Hi.
I like all characters, I just think that Twilight could need a teeny weeny bit more personality
they seemed pretty evil in chapter 6 thou : /
it goes side-by-side with the main chapters
0nevermind I'm not gonna even mention it.
no do it anon, as long as it isn't cupcakes.
i'll read it at some point then
I wanna know :P
CUPCAKES
NO DMAN Q_Q
and now, for the bomb: WHO LIEKS THE CONVERSION BUREAU?
0Yeah
RUUUN
0that was it
wb Sky
Is anyone reading the night that never ended?
10Thanks
Haven't read, but have ERRY STOREE downloaded to word to read at some point, is it good dermathil?
ok anon, then might as well just leave it out. it just carries shitloads of controversy whereaver it goes
11Twilight is a bit dull with her personality, : \
So what ages would you give the main cast guys? Faust said somewhere that they are between 13 and 17, but didn´t mention any pony specifically
0ok lets see. I'm a fan of the sad ones, anybody read today, tomorrow, forever?
But i liek twilight : /
0Colgate:
12Wb as well Skylands
ill check my reading list anon, i cant remember
The Conversion Bureaus and the spin-off fics of it are mostly pretty good.
/me 11can't read sadfix.
mib_8cjw5n
0see equestria daily they just posted some scientific post about it
I'm writing one myself
11fics*
y not?
Ack so I have to look all by myself?
anyone read 'the end' with pinkie pie and the monitor
?
Equestria Daily is huge
11Dman: Yes.
and I am officially in nova prospekyt
11That was amazing.
It's in a Nightly Roundup
mib_8cjw5n: I did
0its not more than a day old
13every time I finish drawing an avatar these days, I end up hating it and starting over :|
it was goood
but silverscreen u no liek sadfix?
I think that Applejack is the oldest one though
Who read Pony Rain?
11No, I don't.
sadfix are awesome
04:/
and sad
:p
0Ummm then there's bubbles that one was pretty sad
04Ohai Sky
:\
also, I keep imagining it will happen, and it WILL happen, even if I have to stay awake for 40 hours and hallucinate it, it WILL happen in the end...;__;
nah anon I haven't read Today, Tomorrow, Forever. But I'll mark it for a future read
11I'm easily depressed and don't need it.
0but today tomorrow forever was by far the saddest one ever.
ah
10Hey Drake
Who read Pony Rain?
mib is it the saddest?
bubbles didn't make me very sad
I'd be interested in reading if so
WB Sky
:>
0Nevermind I remembered another
Today Tomorrow Forever is saddest?
10:3
the one that made me the most depressed was the one that has all the old ponies
/me hugs
0^that one
dash kills herself by sonic rainbooming at the ground
etc
0I think
/me returns the hug
is that the tomorrow one?
0no not that one then
today tomorrow forever is on my to read list
WTF ELISION?!?
SPRINKLES HEYA

Nice layout, Silver.
NO NO CAN'T NO NO N$^&^%£^ WAT NO N&^*&^ CORRUPTNO NO NO
0but the one that made me cry the most was this one
NOOOOO
which one?
@Silverscreen, speaking of DashxSpitfire, have you read 'With a Spark'?
Sprinkles, when you kicked me yesterday I was typing. I felt like fluttershy that got locked outside by Angel back then.
0A summer twilight.
Simply Rarity is pretty sad and made me like Rarity a lot more.
0I bawles

Dman: I don't remember
Apokalipse, at least Ghosties isn't here to chase you away again :P

Hey Sprinkles
Elision: : / i'm interested now, cuz that would make me a very sad pony
psst, I was notApokalipse the whole time
And you got my color wrong on the list. >>;
Sure fooled him :p
@Apokalipse well you're in luck, because he's got a good friend in from out of town (who doesn't know about teh ponies) so he probably won't be on tonight
CELESTIA DAMNIT! >.<

Nice.
13Well

13|D
that one's also on my to read list anon
04Anybody else playing TF2 atm?
Why no images for the pony episodes? Or... they're broken, rather...
13I should stop doing that when I don't like something I've drawn LOL

12OPEN YOUR BIN
12>o

13Permanently deleted >w>
12Darn you
Wut u talkin' 'bout, Sprinkles?
@apokalipse do you know about the google docs reading list?
12but yeah, try drawing something different
They is there.
0Dman: I dont know...
: /
not really
0I check
13I'll just wait until tomorrow and hope I do a better job then |D
12maybe the reason you don't like is because you draw Espeon's more than anything else and so they have to look better than the previous one?
12XD
mib_8cjw5n: that was the frst mlp fic I ever read
Probably just broken on my end then.
it's really sad
@apokalipse it has shitloads of fanfics arranged by characters, type of fanfic, it's amazing. I'll link you:
https://spreadsheets0.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?hl=en_US&key=tiFNdQ8NMC4UpuFebAxh5-g&hl=en_US
they're there for me
Also, way to not mention when dari was added.
hey hey is it memories of days gone by?
could be your wifi.
isn't that list at like 825 now?
In the "It Begins"
Anyone who wants to see the MLP Fanfic reading list, check that link above btw^
13But you know when you draw something and there's just SOMETHING you don't like about it, but you can't tell what? D:
Memories of Long Days Past
I seen the link, but sooo many
angel
memories of days long past is the one with the spell seeing into the past innit?
when WAS he added?
question about your everygrowing list of anime to watch
i dont remember
12Yeah, I get you but DON'T put it in the bin next time LOL
Memories of Days Long Past? is that the one with old ponies ?
0I've heard of these, haven't read them yet http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/story-you-cant-be-missed-if-you-never.html

Same, exact day as me.

that's amazing RBD
6oh my god ;-;
yeah silvermane 828
He was added before the showing, I was added after.
6watch it next
13Apparently it's exactly the kind of anime that I'll love, according to the person who recommended it to me xD
6It's so good
13since I love things that make me cry |D
6yeah
np apokalipse, someone mentioned it to me the same way as i just did to you, glad to be as helpful as that person was to me :P
6I'm not even at the final episode and i've cried a ton lol
ah, ok
Sigh RainBroDash, another link in my bookmarks..!
let me try to find tthe old ponies one
12Oh I've been told to watch that
colgate, you mean another link with 828 links in itself? :D You're gonna be a busy pony.
isn't it the You Can’t Be Missed If You Never Left?
oh man storm that one is good
Also, I save all my fanfics to comp. Do it :)
I don't think so dman
oh ok
13So far, the anime I've cried the most at is Clannad
Wow, that's like 2 fanfics a day since the series came out.
13makes me wonder if this one will have a similar effect~
That's a long list.
READ EM ALL MUAHAHAHAHA
one hundred billion fanfics!
0I'm writing a derpy fanfic
"fanfics"
0that's pretty sad
7On an empty server, average between 30 and 50 FPS. o3o
6I've watched to watch it for months
D:
I'm writing a Luna fanfics *yeah, another one of those*
6so I did
0but its incomplete
*fanfic
there can never be enough luna
i read the diary one of luna 1000 years ago
I loved derpy in Knights of Equestria. She was just awesome.
12There's a kitten on TV and it's soADORABLE
I just click 'list by type, A-Z', scroll down to shipping, have some fun :P
lol
0Anybody here an artist?
13Lol, I really need to be convinced to watch anime these days, since I normally find other things to do instead |D
Yo
Sup
12such as?
6you watched pMMM right?
13I should start watching more over the summer
I can draw
I wish I could do art...
I can also draw
I really do
13Yep :3
6k good
Practice Rainbro!
I'm an After Effects animator, if that counts.
6watch ano hana next
6it's shorter than PMMM
Dman no I'm hopeless. As in abysmal
Yes, I've been practicing since 7th grade
0What do you guys use? digital, traditional?
I can't ... well, never tried animating, but I dr4w stuff : P
13Not even 12 episodes long?
I draw in pencil
then scan and edit on corel
BUT i try to do ERRY thing on pencil
then just colouring in
on corel
I do traditional, but I want to start digital
I guess I do to
too *
13This reminds me, did you ever get around to watching Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka? xD
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-nightfall-at-sweet-apple-acres.html
11Sprinkles, tell us when you have the stream going.
I need to get a tablet, coloring with a mouse is hell
I really REALLY want to collaborate with an artist. I suck at drawing but I'm really good at compositing, animation, and effects.
12PMMM was interesting XD
6it's 11
6and no not yet
elision what is that?
It looks like a fanfic: Nightfall at Sweet Apple Acres
yea i got that much
Oi, Sprinkles, what's your favorite movie? I want to put it on the About Us page
0i gotta go see you guys at the movie
Dman the only reason I can come out with half-decent stuff like that rainbrodash I've half done is because I just spend aaages making sure it looks ok :P that was done with 60% love, 40% colour picker tool/bucket tool/polygonal lasso tool until it looked ok. Rinse and repeat
cya anon :)
bie bie mib
these are the ones that made me like depressed for a little while
11bye, Anon
yo rainbrodash, grab some paper, grab a pencil, and draw
Uh... that's honestly a tough one. XD
Bye mib!
draw absolutely abysmal, and even SHIT ponies
draw some more
draw draw
what Dman said
draw
and eventually, you will draw o...k..
but I draw like a 7 year old O_O
THEN
grab a rubber
13Well, it's the kind of anime that makes you think of a male zombie in a magical girl outfit as perfectly normal after a while LOL
lmao
Dman, how long have you been drawing?
HAHA spam filter XD
D'OH!
then spend 30mins on a drawing
oh dman you so silly
then spend 28 mins on a good drawing
with that rubber
11lol
7Oh, Lyon?
use dat rubber
12lol XD
/me lurks
keep going, and eventually you'll draw ponies in no time at all!
I'm stil on the "draw shitty ponies" stage
keep trying to work pastr it but never managed :(
i get you dman. I think I should get a pencil at some point. I'd love to be able to draw
sorry for my spam, trying to inspire somepony here
absolutely, RainBro
the tempera pony I posted was a first try Dman. And I drew it first. Surely you can do something
If I can do it anyone ca
n
Dman, how long have you been drawing?
first good drawing took me about 2 hours - two 50 mins in maths doing not much but drawn and 20 mins in biology drawing >_<
/me 11pokes Nittany_Tiger with a stick.

You took art classes?

Also, Ghosties is NC, US
You give some damn good ideas. :D
7Does it feel too shoehorned if I ask you, as well as other TF2 players, to come at a common time to play a game together?
11Danke
I love it, especially being centered now.
justthatawesome.jpg

Has anyone watched the G3.5 stuff? Just to see how bad it was?
/me 11is, ironically, getting TF2 now.
D: do not want
nope.avi
silver you're getting it now? yay
6I'd get TF2, if I could play online... ;-;
i didn't like TF2, wasn't balanced, didn't feel rewarding, and is dominated by older players
3.5 is unwatchable.
I watched 2 episodes, I barfed because it was so horrible.
>wasn't balanced. wat
SirSprinkles check your PM :3
11Maximinusone: I watched A Pigs Tale twice, I had enough torture for a few months.
lol
lol@silverscreen

The one that's so bad it's good is Pinkie Pie's Ferris Wheel adventure.
It's the Rebecca Black of MLP videos.
WB Floof~
DAMNIT DAMNIT DAMNIT DAMNIT
10Gracias
'snipin's a good job, mate.'
Is Gen 3.5 called anything special, like how Gen 4 is iM?
hello :>
11I'm loving this.
*FiM
Trying to watch old MLP? You know that stuff is /only/ aimed at girls and no-one else.
glad it is so, silverscreen
3.5 is vapid and shallow. It assumes you haven't learned how to count yet.
that's funny Silverscreen, because I just picked up McD's
11lol, SilverMane.
11....
lol, pyro
04Quan: No, not really
But I haven't tried.
04Seems fair since no one is ever one anyway
11I want some Scootaloo Nuggets now.

here we go
i got me a 10 piece of Scootaloo Mcnuggets
I watch it just to see how bad it is.

and that sums up one of the scenes we'll be watching tonite, folks
And a Apple Bloom Pie

7Mmm'jay.

Confound these ponies, they drive me to talk about dresses

lol
for the gala
The chat smile for : / is misleading
Wow, reconnecting makes a world of difference
http://i.imgur.com/Ee8n9.gif
oh gawd, the gala dresses were gorgeous, especially RD and Fluttershy's
I remember watching the dressmaking video and being like "why in the hell am I enjoying this so much?"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEdICVzB4qQ
^ Yes
^^
art of the dress best song :P
dammit silver
art of the dress is my favorite episode. i don't know why. it's not even about my favorite chars
I thought the second RD outfit was still badass
2i'm back to say bye
Yeah just gorgeous. I almost squeed
8winter wrap up is best song
LOL
2so, uh Osha-Bye allz!
Neigh, I say neigh!
winter wrap up all the way
7Bye. o.o
2gotta go do some chores :P
yay silver, your request is gut, ja? : D
Rarity= best singer, which explains Sweetie Belle
2don't look at me like that, it's creepy..........
11:D
Bye Chao
i'm split between Winter Wrap Up, and Art of the Dress, but no other song comes close to these two
Don't cut the little finger! How do you keep the soap without it?!
I have sung art of the dress while working on my engine.
lol
11Which is Ironic since Sweetie's singing voice is Applebloom's VO, but AppleJack's Singing voice is the worst
I covered Art of the Dress
oh, btw, i got skype now
lies rarity = worst singer, most vibrato
I listened to winterwrapup in my head, while doing my daily 3 mile run. manliness
(iPod ofc)
and a couple other pony songs >_>
Nice.

Chickenquest?
MOUTH WAT
;Friday
FUNDAY MONDAY IS BETTAH
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUUUUUU
wtf is this
poor fluttershy
*LISTENS_TO_DAY9*
THIS IS EPIC
Twilight fits that role better than Fluttershy.
I was thinking even larger, like HDTV size xD
this is really degrading...
Ether: seconded
That'd be insane
I HAVE NEVER HEARD THIS SONG TO COMPLETION UNTIL TODAY D:
@dermathil is the Day9Daily streaming currently?
YOU MOTHER F***ING BASTARD
Ponies only makes this marginally better
mercy
HAH
PHEW
no.
03OK so
i had avoided Friday so well so far
hi Rora
i never heard it
dat was close, pony
until now
03do you know what I hate even more than Apple?
I love this video.
@dermathil kk
11CLIMAX TIME!
03Magic Jack
i can't watch this enough
LOL
But the funday monday song is available on youtube
03I seriously want them to go die in a fire
I have
03I just saw *THREE* of those ads in a row
We burst your Friday cherry
6I don't think I can cry anymore lol....
inb4 gotcha
6that's a good show ;-;
/me facehoof
Now for a GOTCHA in this video
I like Magic Jack; annoying ads, yes, but good product, also yes
Celestia... dammit, Sol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZpurerF2HM
so. dam. GOOD.
/me runs before explosion happens
Adrenaline-pumped vids like that are good.
Ew that thing
03no
SilverMane trollface.jpg
03not at all
Just use Skype
;o
11H.A.R.M.O.N.Y.
03it is NOT a good product whatsoever
What is a "Magic Jack" never heard of that thing.
03you want to know why?
Gotta figure out what H.A.R.M.O.N.Y. stand for.
lol this is epic
03-O
Jack Black
GOTCHA
prepare to be harmonised
gotcha
03but here's why
/me hides
Ah, VOIP.
Oh, and we need to see Cereal Velocity's My First Wing Bondage Kit video again.
031. It's a little USB dongle, meaning your computer has to be on
11So which Element is Princess Celest?
imma firin' ma harmony laz0r
03say there's a fire
03GOOD LUCK CALLING 911, YOU DIE IN THE FIRE
she isn't one rite?
11She has to be if she used them against NMM before.
I can haz POTS plz?
a fanfic i read goes into detail about her relation to elements of harmony really well, actually
Use a cellphone?
8Silver: you cant type a post that says Princess Celest
princess celestia is the element of trolling. so laughter, maybe?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU9o8cN39BQ
032. Unlike something like Vonage, it doesn't have its own dedicated line
8take it down and try again
6She's technically all of them.
(POTS = Plain Old Telephone Service)
Trollestia is the element of mooning.
/me cuddles
03yep.
Celestia is ALLLLL of them
All I use is POTS :>
Element of justice
Sure Bell is a bit... egotistical.
Justice... riight
But they, and this is the amazing thing, work.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNuRQmvykwk Y u get banned, epicvid?
/me is under the influence of several fanfics
celestia stories make me sad. you know the picture at teh end of the opening video, with the six friends?
...Even if their internet is... less then functional.
Yea?
(Oh hi throttling.)
backup successfully restored
What does that Russian say?
03we have digital voice but it's through the cable company
03so yeah
TOOT TIEM
YES!
AWH YEAH
03it works just as well as old school analog
03but no interference :P
YES! YESYESYESYESYESYESYES
it says something to do with plan went accordingly
(And that's why I have DSL from not-Bell.)
Sol: what I said
ever seen the pic with the OTHER pupils and friends of pupils shes had?
said on youtube
11SilverMane: I saw that, yes.
I personally like it
...
haha wow :P
>TOOT TIME. >offline
sol: Backup successfully restored.
No TooT? D:
I need my stream :(
03Pattyrick, just hope you never have something that would result in your computer turning off as then yuou're stuck without a phone :P
Mermathil: Ah, thank you
I personally prefer POTS.
we live in Italy, and we don't have to pay for a phone call to th US
it was horrendously depressing to see the other pupils shes had, and you could clearly see the age of the image via the clothing
*Dermathil
ITS A D NOT AN M
/me 11whips SirSprinkleS
Mostly becuase, even during the uberblackout, we had phone.
drf, let me explain my setup
11BACK TO WORK!
Why not use Skype?
:p
do it again silverscreen >_<
we have a regular telephone
connected to the line
/me likes it rough
oh god, what did I just type?
o.o
he don't want it to be shown to us
(And... if you wanted to be a bit... ahem... creative, you can get 40V off your phone lines if you have plain old copper.)
11inb4 Ferris wheel reference.
(And 180V when it's ringing.)
(I was just about to say that too)
'now it's a ghost town'
that's for calling to our neighbors, the Navy Base, or God forbid Italian police or firefighters
a circle of iron ions?
8Silvermane: megusta.jpg
no wait, that's a Ferrous wheel...
we just use Magic Jack for when we want to call friends and family back in the US
my little ponies, the movie begins in but 10 minutes
Why would you call a Naval base?
(Let me guess: "Uh guys, could you shoot missiles in the opposite direction please?")
We can't handle Brodyquest. Too many people glancing forever at once. It's break the Space-Time Continuum
we watched it Friday night though
then we need PINKIEQUEST
sprinkles left
no! Mentally Advanced Series!
uh oh
SPR is an amazing movie. I love it.
MEDIC
MLP: The Mentally Advanced Series
8pinkiequest is better when there are more people to TOOT
ah there we are
oh crap. did he have interwebs connection again?
oh he back
BRODYQUEST NAO
6...well that was new.
Hai ther
hai sire
Ah.
6Never been trolled by my comp before.
trust me, not all Navy bases are made just for military purposes
ok so it wasn't just me
WB sprinkles
8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/meta/src/130817792149.png
it's hard to explain to somebody who isn't in the military
berg of sprinkles
lawl @ Sprinkleberg
in fact, out here in Italy, it'd probably be a safer bet for me to call the Navy base if there was a fire than to call the Italian fire department
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnAtBxpihOE
6Gimme a sec to get set back up everypony...
k
Heh.
okey dokey lokey
^
IDK their number, though, so I couldn't even as a last resort :P
.....okey...dokey...lokey...
such a creepy phrase if you say it right ^
Potassium
as proved by the show, silvermane
I have relatives in Germany, who've made jokes about US bases in their country. :P
Yup, there are plenty of bases there
Florine Uranium Carbon Potassium

Sulfur, Hydrogen, Iodine,..... DAMMIT
hey guys
So why use MagicJack if you don't have a computer
xD
Hullo
hello
J is the only letter not used in the periodic table
omfg
YES lolipop. Thanks.
homemade pasta
sogood
Ok is actually an interesting phrase. It originally was All Correct, was misspelled as Ol Korrect, Shortened to OK, reduced to K, then smartasses started saying Potassium. The next step is to throw bananas at people
HML, what I mean is that not everybody we call with Magic Jack has a computer
wat
The original joke was slightly more racy. (Replace "dating" with "sleeping with" for the original. :P )
and we don't have much Skype credit
...Huh.
TOOT
Ah :p
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooook.
I don't have any Skype Credit, nor do I need it
You saying I'm a Smart Ass ^_^ Thank you
hokay
8http://192.20.225.36/tts/speech/c322aab1336a0afbc37f1b3119fb3ce4.wav
I thought ok was short for okay? O_o
that is the origin and future of the term OK
.wav? o god it's that
actually, Okay is an attempt at making OK be a word, rather than an accronym
OH GAWD
inb4 moonbase alpha
that is terrifying, Hipster_Brony
TOOTtiem soon
I don't think anyone really knows where ok came from
03<Pattyrick> we just use Magic Jack for when we want to call friends and family back in the US <- why not use Google Voice?
6Okay, back up everypony.
03for that matter
03I want to build my own "magic jack"
k
No, SilverMane is Ol Korrect
:P

Now, play SPR.
I've used an Android phone, and I think it's ok
03Pattyrick, it's purely on concept
So do I :p
BLASPHEMY
it's some basshunter remix I think
03Why would I pay for something that can be done for free?
lol cocaine
Hipster_Brony: Agreed.
Wait... did you say Basshunter?
Or for less? XD
would I know about something that I've never heard of?
this is one of the songs that don't belong in English
basshunter=swedens biggest faggot
That makes me hate this song even more
i thnk this is a basshunter remix, but not an official one
hrm...
11Hipster: Dealwithit.jpg
This is what you get when you mix hallucinogens and stimulants, kids.
This the Alina remix
I've never even heard of GV before
song name : Alina - When You Leave
Maybe you should check the Internet more often?
Yep.
yea sol
8Silver: NO U
I hated this song because it was Romanian, and now it's a fucking Basshunter remix?
You might find new things on there :P
ok, I'll update the FB then
It was a Basshunter remix
Seizures
11Hipster: How about I web your shit?
I'll get the twitter.
/me SilverMane: Lol why can't I hold all these party?
silverscreen, how about I love your shit?
I want to remind everybrony in the room that I swore never ever to take any drug in my life.
I've found plenty, it scares me to try to look for more 0__o
...and tolerate : )
Ahhhh pinkie, second best pony indeed!
03LOL
Well get used to it!
03still
Dragosta your boo
But ponies is a drug
03all I'm saying is I hate MagicJack, even more than I hate Apple
^
you're on a drug, it's called PONIES
Dermathil you broke your promise when you took ponies.
Now what about Google+ DRF? :P
^
11Pinkie is a hell of a drug
I'm on a drug, it's called... dammit Elky, beat me to it
^
03mainly because it's false advertising
Same could be said for internet.
WWwwwwww, translation fail
ok, and all I'm saying is that I use it and I'm a satisfied customer
Pinkie. Not even once
especially when I can't stop.
in what way?
is it be movie times?
I bet no one here knows what Vode An is
Silverscreen, I was thinking just that
6Uno momento while I set up the movie.
what is falsely advertised?
awesome :D
Se senor
I'm sure both/all products fasely advertise, it's the way of business
also, do you mind if i plug a charity before we start?
offleen?
I want to watch movie but I want to play tf2....
oh ok
yay movieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
*falsely
moviEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEminimEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEe
03they say you can replace your home phone service with it
I just came back from 3 hours of tf2
03all it does is replace one phone
@dman <3
I want to watch the movie but I want to sleep too...
E
haivmaind
Don't mind at all.
MINI MERELL EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
you can, but that doesn't mean you should
03and I would hate to see someone have no phone service except MagicJack, they'd be completely screwed if their house was on fire
razor, screw sleep, you can sleep when your dead
I agree it's not a great idea as a full home phone service
alright, we need to be yelling battlecries of the Lunar Republic resistance
so what's so special with this film anyway
also, it's 2 am here, so nothing really makes sense anymore
well, they'd be screwed even with regular phone service
Sleep is for the dead
alright, im gonna do announcements now then
I'm up in 6 bloody hours you gentlemen, I have tea to drink, scones to eat, and a spiffing good show to watch chaps...;__;
03no?
just a great movie
Saving Private Ryan is the best war movie ever?
what about the phones burning up too?
it's only 8 pm
and the lines?
03because with regular phone service you can call 911
03LOL
sleep is for... sleepy people?
and the electricity being cut?
It's 2AM here...
bjornot i like it :/
03phone lines are separate
k
03most phones don't need electricity
Phones should stay up O.o
8Really quick announcements
03they power themselves from the phone lijne
03yep
03even if the power's out
but if the house was on fire...
Unless
03trust me
03it will work
and the phone lines burnt up
ok
8as you may have noticed, our website has changed
The entire area/power plant died
:P
03but with MagicJack, or even something like Vonage, if your power goes out you're screwed
6Because we

The only way the telco's copper is going down is if:
8Links to our Facebook page, Twitter and email are at the bottom of the page if you want to contact us

aren't a lot of phones these days powered by electricity?
03yes, but they're battery powered
Yes
8this being July 4th weekend

yeah
8i know a lot of us are younger and dont have a lot of money
8but if you can spare money, please donate to the Yellow Ribbon Fund

THANK YOU SILVERSCREEN FOR THE NEW, IMPROVED WEBSITE!!!!!!!!!
Hipster_Brony... you call THIS a website?
03they've been doing it since the 80s
neat banner by the way
Thank you Silverscreen. You did a great job with the site. :)
Wow..
03but thank you Apple
A friend of mine, ended up getting fibre'd up.
Pretty new banner by the way.
yo I'm really happy for you full metal jacket and Imma let you finish but private ryan had the best war movie of all time. OF ALL TIME.
I never knew that
@SirSprinkles: YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH
I didn't notice the change
03yep
03they're the leading audiobook manufacturer
So Apple invented the 'Audio-book' too
OF ALL TIME!
03and they've been doing it since casette tapes
And they owned an ancient phone.
I'm blind
Love the new site
I just hope Nick cage isn't in this one.
6Press play on your streams everypony.
NOT THE BEES
Full Metal Jacket is the second best war movie of all time though
puressu purayu desu
NOT THE BEES
03LOL Droid Incredible 2
But Nick Cage is badass ;_;
the bees
sound on?
Actually the "standard" US phone from the 1950s. (I.e. the one you see as a movie prop for the "Red Phone".)
03LOL
you have it muted
6Sound is on.
8yeah, sound is on
Yeah... it stopped working.
03you mean one that's a rotary dialer
03?
rly?

http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/03/zuckerberg-surprised-that-people-are-surprised-hes-on-google/
oh ok
i don't hear anything... oh
Forget nick, we need will smith
OH.
My gran has that :p
That's right.
rotary phones.... classic
11This...is Pinkie. Pinkie Pie. It is Fun, it is awesome, and kids love her. It's the most addictive kind of Pony, and it can love you. Nopony knows how much of here there is, so everytime she's around, the 4th wall's in danger, but it's so worth it. Look, everypony loves ponies, and Pinkie is one of the best, but there are other and better ones. Remember that.
I love it
It's to be dramatic
I forgot that.
srsl guys you should really improve the site
rainbrodash, my Fraps is ready : D

classy beginning
SKYLANDS
03rotary phones suck
Fair warning: the first scene is kind of legendarily disturbing, or so I'm told
10hi
Yeah, it stopped working due to... well the fibre-to-copper converter didn't give enough powah.
10also, PM?
03because pretty much everything now requires touchtones
no need to ask
It is.
Hipster: UPGRADE TO PRO TODAY
bjornfot, relatively rude
inb4 fuck shit stack
it's sad, and gruesome, but realistic
this whole movie: *upgrade to pro today*
11Hipster: "Upgrade Photobucket to pro today"
8yes, this movie is quite violent and gory
The first fight scene is amazing.
ive not seen the whole thing ebefore only bits of it
:o
Ohmai
Bloody and gory all the way.
Very violent, yes.
The first scene is one of the best action scenes ever
Oh, he used one of those funky/neat/cool kit things that lets you make Touch Tone tones using a rotary phone.
8especially the next scene
one of those movies where you walk away keenly aware of your own mortality
rainbrodash chill :3 i was trying to make a fuckshitstack ref
not for those who saw the TF2 version lol
So, it works. Except no octothorpe or start keys.
Blood and gore all the way acrooooossss the skyyyy...

FRANCE IS WHERE NORMANDY IS, THATS WHY
Oh, I have an AT&T 2500 actually. :P
rainbrodash is a french spy xP
*suddenly...
I don't like the people. I love the language though, oh my days
It also refuses to work on a fibre-to-copper converted line.

And it IS touchtone.
That's not Arlington Cemetery?
ah oui oui
this is a beautiful scene. the story Bittersweet reminds me of it a little
french=OH YM GOD WHAT AMI LISTENING TO
I love and tolerate France
(It's basically the Touch Tone version of the 500.)

My friend though got fibre runs to their neighbourhood and the lines converted from fibre to copper. And the converter doesn't put enough current and/or voltage into the phone lines to ring an old phone like that.

this scene is so awesome, every WWII shooter uses it for inspiration
(Oh hi 28.8K.)
I just finished my last semester of French in college
most ww2 shooters suck though
if this doesn't lag, we know that it was just because Starship Troopers was bluray HD...
even mw3
and I still suck at the spelling
will use this
some how
Medal of Honor: Allied Assault pretty much ripped the entire scene off, and so did Company of Heroes
11You puke, I puke, the he pukes.
PUKECEPTION
a lot of the old WWII shooters were amazing, like COD 1 and 2
MoH Frontlines was where it was at bro razor
i havent watched this movie in a long time good movie
mw3 with normandy landing ... FUND IT
that ripped this off too
03it's the same service as our cable and internet
>Tom Hanks
he she we puke
COD 2 is the only WW2 shooter I got.
03but the modem converts it into analog phone service
silvermane >implying COD was ever good
CoD 2 was great
Tom Honks
Demanthil how much do you speak?
well cod2 was good
>Tries not to the of Forrest Gump
Tom Hanks>Nick Cage
cod 2 was the best cod
Nock Coge
woll smoth gais
MoH:AA did Normady well.
Bjornfot >implying COD wasn't?
hi dudes
now cod sux
03however, the modem has a battery backup in case the power goes out :P
Detective. French is my native language. I learnt English and became bilingual.
COD is great
leeeeeroy jeeenkins
hi charmin
just not 9001/10 great as most kids say
6...what soldiers?
oh Cool
MEDIC
you're a halo fan aren't you
8inb4 TF2 references
too late Hipster_Brony, Dman beat you to it
6inb4 Starship Troopers references
come on guys stick to the plan
no way silvermane
11And that's why I support Operation Human Shield.
Get the sentry
one does not simply leeroy jenkins in normandy
SirSprinkles: Too late
Heh.
: F
I'm not going to get TF2 references :(
: D *
I root for SOCOM/MAG
just becuase your bones are broken it doesnt mean they wont stop bullets from hitting me
so um...hold on it might take me a while but I might be able to talk to you in a highly butchered version of your language lol
DSL is still the best *shot*
steam froze for me :|
MAG is alright, Socom was never my flavor
A guy I know (helped me get some expansion stuff for my PDP-11) has an old AUTOVON phone.
get to the top your bubbleas are runing out
lol
It's pretty neat. Though incredibly ugly and large.
COD2 had a level about normandy. it was frickin amazing.
germans: dayum painkillah
Tu aimes cette film?
Bjornfot: Try ArmA II
i'm not the FPS-type of person, i prefer strategy over action... hence MAG
dont worry he will just respawn
That's some hardcore shit
ikr cod 2s d day finale was intense
Armored Assault?
aimes-tu cette film?*
ArmA, Armed Assault
6QUICK! WHERE'S THE KILLCAM FROM?
Ce film est un bon film de guerre./Good War Movie is Good.
lol
Call of Duty
germans: damn painkiller. Soldiars: damn spawnkiller
03eh
aimbot h4x!
(AUTOVON was the US military phone network. It also was Touch Tone and used the A, B, C, and D tones.)
03I kinda don't like DSL
OUI
cowadootee
03becaues ew needing filters on all your phone lines
03cable works great for me
This is pretty violent
@SirSprinkles *pause during the killcam to see where teammates are on minimap*
zat is correct, madamo
important things to notice, the fact that the entire beach became stained red
but im tired of cod now they dont really innovate so i got bored with them
(IT;s also a four line phone. Which he doesn't really need as he only has one phone line... and the extra keys do nothing really useful.)
@Sol: It gets more violent as the movie progresses.
^
Old CoD > new CoD past 4.
Damn spawncampers
>implying any FPS innovates
11I spy a Tom Hanks.
cod6 was brilliant actually
i still play MoH
i havent played black ops and dont plan to
dont
it was just overhyped by 8yolds
I usually get bored with each CoD after a month or so
stop freezing argh
Tom Hanks is a spy!?
MW2 was awesome, not impressed with Black Ops
same razor
Within a month*
lmao
um....
Black Ops. I have one thing to say. >DAT FUKKEN HIT DETECTION WATAFAK?!?
arm
LOL
03we have two phone lines
DetectiveBrony: Film is masculine word. So Ce is better to use than Cette (which is for "feminine" words, like "she" is in english)
need a hand?
/me shudders
noobs
Pick up arm, run away with it.
captain, I think you lost your arm there
better pick it up
I don'T like those realistic shooters, the look all the same to me
i think the last good cod game i played was 4
getting pnwd
he picked up his OWn arm
dermathil tes francais?
I have one, that's all I need.
Dude just grabbed his arm and trotted on up the battlefield. Like a boss.
/me 11imagines a Toy story version of this....

It just goes all quiter here... it adds to the atmosphere so well
I be bilingual
>Only one who doesn't play Call of Duty
Right...I always had a problem with the gender of words
'i solve problems. not philosophical ones like what is love.' 'MY ARM'
03because my mom works out of our house, so she has a separate line for her business

wait, THAT was the awesome part?
8i feel like a terrible person for cracking jokes during this movie
11I spied a protagonist.
I'm just here to watch...
same, feelsbadpony
Hipster_Brony: just pretend it's a 'coping mechanism'
was one of the awesome parts, but it is an inspiring movie through out
elision>implying it isn't
Dem typewriting skeelz.
cpypasta
she hacking
Yeah, but I've seen the movie 10 times already
11Hipster_Brony: Humor is a means of acceptance.

This is kind of sad
They see me typin', they hatin'
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!!!!!!

hopefully I will get ideas for my fanfic from watching this movie.
this is how coding worked in WW2
It's like an assembly line of "Your son is dead" letters....
gotta treat it like one, then

8what they're typing: ojbpnpiaueaiudfsbgvviuabe fouvaebuga
Oh, you will.
Lol
Someone needs to make "Sir" an official meme
it actually is Sol
Dman: there are calmer moments in it.
Dear princess celestia, Twilight is still MIA
oh god insertcupcake
They see me Trollin, they hatin, reporting to mods tryin' to catch me spammin' dirty,
herbablurghagbbststtr
what they want us to believe: reports on the front line today have...
Dermathil, I've seen this ^_^
Saving Private Applejack. FUND IT
YES
Samurai AppleJack
Dman: maybe something like the current scene?
Do eet
Dman, XD
8but that would have ponies dying in it...
8DO NOT WANT
no, Saving Private Rarity fits better in the name sake
MFW JUST REALISED HE HAS 1 ARM
someone recreate THE WHOLE MOVIE with ponies
i guess dermathil
We have enough Grimdark ponyfics ;_;
Pinkamina: that means Applebloom and Big Macintosh died!?!??
moar
never enough Grimdark
lol nevermind
^^^^ awesome Brony
Sol, awww....but I was planning another one :(
what if season 2 attracts more new bronies...HOW MORE FANFICS POSSIBRU?
Hipster_Brony, I don't mind. It means these brave ponies fight hard to keep their land safe, besides, outside of equestria isn't 100% happy or crime free.
8crowbar: no spoilers please
/me rereads the night that never ended
11Exposition Exposition Get it out a. s. a. p.
Sawwy.
This part always makes me cry...
Dat Plot!
8i HATE grimdark, thats just my opinion
well, same here
exposition = plot
As long there is a peaceful ending to it.
I dislike grimdark :/ I don't find it that entertaining
ugh
Fuck grimdark. I watch Ponies to ESCAPE from my agoniuzing depression
*agonizing
^
i still read cupcakes
11Pinkimina: Dito.
it depends on my moon
>says freakin Pinkamina
Grimdark and Sad hit me the hardest, Shipping makes me sad, random makes me insane
mood*
6I laugh at the ponies that think Grimdark belongs in the culture. It's just... no.
At the moment I don't think ponies mix with Grimdark
Hipster: Grimdark stories that are grimdark to be grimdark are bad. Grimdark stories that are grimdark as an aftereffect of the main story are good.
I like grimdark
Meh, I don't really like grimdark, i'll go as far as war though.
I like grimdark, it can be pretty fun
I watch Ponies so I can walk around all day smiling
Mindless grimdark is bad.
What Dermathil said
^
I also like to feel really sad sometimes
Bubbles was freakin' sad, bro.
8dermathil: i disagree
:'(
FYI my username is PINKAMINA not PINKAMENA
There is a difference
I E
RAMIREZ, KILL CHUCK NORRIS WITH YOUR FACE!
...sir
Oh jeez. I can't believe I forgot there was a stream today. AGAIN. D:
so it's like, 'Pinkie is mine'?
you guys make it sound like grimdark has to be something bad, just take the Fallout pony crossover, 2 awesome things combined
ponies make me cry sometimes. Today, Tomorrow, Forever. Teacher and Student.
No
manly tears
Hipster: I understand why you do, and that's why I respect your opinion.
Pinkie + Kamina
for every grimdark there's 10 shipping fics
NOOOO
8i dont like any stories with ponies that involve death, dying, maiming etc...
As in the badass dude from Gurren Lagann
I haven't cried for about 5years. feelsbadpony.jpg
When you read a story about Equestria was a fictional place made up by ponies in delusion, and how ponies like Applejack are really starved to the point of malnutrition, yo begin to hate grimdark
8i watch ponies to escape from that
HOLY MANURE PINKAMINA
My Little Muffin, part one, is sad as hell
Ponies dyin makes me sad
....
dying*
I understand that, Hipster.
I don't read fanfics at all. I read some of the comics, but I never read fanfics
I'm just in it for a good story. And grimdark can provide a good story
And that's why I respect that.
I read cupcakes, I felt fine after..
same here razor
cupcakes is just derp
cupcakes hurt, but it made me stronger
8same razor, its been over a month since i have read any fanfics
cupcakes is hilarious
6We don't talk about Cupcakes here.
it's not really grimdark just dumb and gory
I think cupcakes was intended to be funny.
Pikaru, heh,cool. :)
GUYS, CUPCAKES IS PERMBANNED FROM THIS CHAT. REMEMBER THAT.
Well I haven't read any fanfic at all
8guys, no Cupcakes discussion
8it causes too much drama
how about the Luna games
/me is going to make OC pony reaction images, even though he doesn't post on ponychan, or anywhere that requires it.
suddenly, no chat?
How about that Bubbles
11Grimdark is only to be involved in universes that fit them best. And Grimdark fics are best when focused on psychology.
bubbles also didn't make me that sad
Buttercup is better
8RainBro, why don't you post on Ponychan?
apple bloom game ftw
wait, is Bubbles a fanfic?
I've never been to Ponychan, or 4chan
Yes.
today tomorrow and forever? yes. a summer twilight? YES
the one on Newgrounds, Charmin?
bubbles? eh
bubbles is awesome
Pony Rain has a psychological twist that makes it good. Same for Pony Psychology.
yes
Bubbles is a fanfic about how Derpy got her Cutie Mark
For all who don't know what cupcakes is: http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/120/163/Pinkamina%20meets%20cupcakes%20dog.jpg?1304537121

oh the snes one with the creepy town D:
11That game was freaky.
Charmin, you played that too? :D
Also, IN THE GRIMDARK GRIMDARK, THERE IS ONLY GRIMDARK.
oh, that one. saw it on EQD, didn't read yet
6eat911, no Cupcakes discussion here.
@Hipster_Brony I just don't really engage that well with the majority of the posters. I like the scene but I just don't find it that enjoyable for some reason. I don't really understand it myself
Bubbles is awesome and sad. Happ sad, that is.
"sweet Apple Massacre" is the most horrifying fanfic. I'm actually thinking of taking the author of that one to court. Or something. Whatever will land him in prison for obscenity.
*Happy
really?
8WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT CUPCAKES DISCUSSION
umm...
must. shake. off. tiredness
8STOP
no cupcakes...sir
dammit, can we stop talking about fanfics, now? It's making me want to stop watching and start reading
REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY
really, people need to get better at ignoring stuff
So, "Cupcakes", mean anything grimdark/gory/violent. Ok.
Hipster, we need a filter that automatically changes the word that shall not be pronounced into "muffin"
All right, sir
ABOUT MOVIE
And the big wigs come in after all the fighting acting like nothing happened...
HEY LET'S DISCUSS HOW GAY RAINBOW DASH IS
but Muffin is also a sad word.
Muuffiiiinnnn...
this chat needs more wordfilters
RD would totally hit that like a freight train
6Bjorn, don't start.
everything gets better with lots of wordfilters
MUUFFFINNN
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE INSTEAD, ALRIGHT?!?!
This chat has wordfilters?

Tom Hanks is smart.

Applejack doesnt even have her hat... HASBRO I am dissapoint...
what comic
love the deformed ponies
they're fun
oh, that 4 page official comic?
Dose vectors
8twilight's face is all messed up
that comic should be banned from here as well
When they make rarity said "I love shopping!", I wanted to punch my screen.
hasbro comics are the best
mmm, ground tomatoes
The Time Off comic is the best
At least her arm is in the right place, unlike the Bridlemaids poster ><
the best kind
FOOD FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT
Tomacco, fuel of war.
I like those, it's like they're parodying themselves
Dermathil, A gaming website I go to. Started a group there called "Brony alliance" and EVERYONE's hating
They were made from some comic makers, hopefully, they don't influence the show too much.
Funny how fans can create better comics than people getting paid to do the same
Sol, that's a leg, not an arm. Ponies ain't got arm.
Those vectors...ughhh..
indeed
8paul giamatti is a pretty chill bro
What's the website, The Great and Powerful Fluttershy?
Tyranico, we don't have pressure.
defromed ponies are my fav

>Human Poses >Translate leg as arm >D'oh
ah
@Hipster_Brony, random question: what's ponychan's usual reception of people who post reaction images using OC ponies?
Fuck Screwattack, I stopped going there 2 years ago
First post is called "My little bronies" if you're interested.
8RainBro: fine, as long as they aren't sues
It's a good community.
the only thing that saves the horrible plot of those comics is the weird art, you should be glad
Never been there, TGPF.
6What Hipster said.
When I saw the human poses, the first thing I thought of is transforming hands/gloves that turn into human hands.. O.o
fine, as long as they aren't ember
8Ember Storm is really the only one that gets hate
11RainBroDash: The majority of Ponychan is fine with OCs so long as they aren't Mary Sues.
Sonichu...
It helps me maintain my gamer side.
lol
ember storm?
11Which is really unwarranted nowadays.
6Ember Storm is an alicorn.
6>>;
8Ember Storm is an alicorn OC
aw gawd
oh my god
I think the ember thing is just for fun nowadays
OC Alicorns are bad, mmmkay?
ugh
Alicorns in general usually -> bad rap
OCs aren't all that bad.
OC pegasi
an alicorn pyromancer with a crush on twilight
:D
8people hate on him ALL the time, its very un-brony liek
8like*
!!!
yes i hate oc alicorns
I will make a Super Mary Sue OC
8you will get welcomed
11Nope
11You'd be welcomed as a brony.
THIS SCENE
Ponychan is awesome
I prefer normal reaction images personally, but go ahead
this is a crazy scene
DAT FRENCH BAIT
8post an "im new here" thread on /oat/ and you will get lots of welcomes and hugs
/me 11uses OC Reaction images for RP only.
EVERYBODY, SHUT UP AND WATCH PLZ
And I will make fanfics for my SUper Mary Sue Deluxe OC
Fair enough. I'd not post it unless it looked decent enough anyway. Some OC ponies just look... oh dear...
TGPFluttershy: Eeyup
i say, screw the haters
DAT SACRIFICE...sir.
SECOND BEST SCENE IN MOVIE
This scene was heart wrenching.
lol take my child
Like the ones with bright greens, or full-black OC ponies. bleugh.
teach her how to fight
Take my kid, she's going to be much safer in the fighting
I'm nervous at posting and joining stuff, got a bit of an aversion with a not being accepted complex.
8Vin Diesel dun goof'd
Same as RenegadeBrony
Ponychan is very accepting
They yell too much
holy crap it IS vin diesel
BAM
Oh God. :<
Well no shit Silvermane
It begins.
most OC ponies are pretty obivous, they don't fit in with the show
And now he's dead
damn you fucking pedo, give me that girl
i never noticed
Oh no. He's not dead. At least not yet.
Dumb frenchies
MEDIC
Not yet, but soon to be, and that means that the war is lost
You get to see him bleed out in the rain. Suffering.
THAT: was doctor assisted homicide
Dat choppy rain sound.
Furry Fandom is, TGPFluttershy
I think it's because they tend to come off as cultists

TGPFluttershy, maybe they are just jealous of how powerful we really are together. THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP!
Oh, sorry.

Eh, not always.
Brony, heh, it happens.
Which was 2 weeks ago
12kay D:
furry and bronies are not mutualy exclusive
well, it's mostly because some bronies decide to be pretty aggressive in their showing their obsession
But otakus, gamers and others? Nooo...
Wow, Vin Deisil dun goofed

03and not youi
