buffering
CrimsonPhoenix: I would argue with you on that for the last two but everyone has their own opinions I suppose...
DerpStar: Predator Mods? :$
DerpStar: You'd better distance yourself from me too if you want to avoid the mods. :D
How about FOQ?
No matter how silly I think said opinion is....
/me hands GilDash a C6
Spade-Magnes[R], Past sins is a bout an OC mary-sue
Screen caption?
buffering
/me opens up armoury to everypony fearing the mods

DerpStar: Heh, they've got banhammers. This isn't going to do squat. :D
and there's a lot of OOC in it
I don't fear the mods.
twilight_sprinkle: That's a typo, everyone knows that already. :P
CrimsonPhoenix: <.< Again... I read both of those and liked them alot but AGAIN, every one has opinions....
Well at least you're ready for zombie

Spade-Magnes[R] incometance from everyone involved
My days been good, and yours alexxm?
You get a new computer that comes with eplorer
i've been good EggWhite
you open that only to get a new browser
I use the best web browser.
Lolifox.
that's...kinda sad don't you think?
Anything on right now?
Ranfox all the way
....what's all this about a loli fox? O.o
Seriously who uses IE anymore
heyas Jun
:s
no one
I use IE.
http://www.levistone.net/img/img7_lolifox.png
Pretty sure the idea of Fox as an underaged anthro girl is kind of....weird.
we have have succesfully erected a giant golden cock with diamond balls on minecraft
so more mature
Well done

Give this man a Nobel Prize.

and a tnt you know what
03wtf, my cable box just broke

CK|Basara: Weird to you, not to me.
how.....enthralling
I use IE too......if I need to do something in Windows Explorer and can't reach it through Program Files
I got off early ^_^ as soon as I finish eating, I'm off to the Galveston meetup - best to head out before 3 as traffic starts to pick up
But in all honesty IE is only good for one thing
I used to browse with Firefox but I've switched to chrome JUST recently
Getting a better browser
weird
:s
yeah Spade-Magnes[R] but just think of how sad this must be if browser had emotion
I'm gonna assume that BronyStates mail server thingy is still...ded.
actually meetup is tomorrow, I'm just heading out early to avoid the weekend traffic

User0: Awesome. :)
User0: I'm only destroying Access though. :D
Would it be too much to ask that they visit for just ten minutes, read our story and learn about us before teleproting off?
GilDash: You manic!

Om: I'm just messing with you. :)

GilDash: DOH

Hey GilDash, are you going to BUCK?
Deceptive_Cadence go back to your fackin' diddy donuts
DWR_PokemonWhite2: Don't fack with the colonel
I fack with whoever I want.
DWR_PokemonWhite2: Whoop whoop whoop!
alexxm: what is the old way ?
GOGO BUCKING GOGO!!!!!
Deceptive_Cadence: I wouldn't like to presume. :)
Deceptive_Cadence: There's trouble with me and some of the mods, and I've not really got a clue who. :D
/me steals GilDash's ball and runs off.
GilDash: I'm sure it'll be fine, Chrysalis can probably guide you.
sergio_scriptor i don't know i was just telling you what i heard
Deceptive_Cadence: I think that one's got an issue with me too. :D
alexxm: you made it all sound so misterious and ancient :D
GilDash is really Bronystate's local ruffian :D
MadSurge: I'm not, I'm just misunderstood! :D
GilDash: No i think we understand quite well
GilDash: sure :D
Hue hue hue
GilDash isn't the local ruffian.
He's the local RPffian.
Ha, I scored a crash!
Deceptive_Cadence: Deceptive pun do ho ho
/me is bored
Deceptive_Cadence: Hey, I've been holding back for a good while now. There's much "worse" our there then me anyway. :)
I'm a walking talking pun.
/me glomps Sweetie_Belle

Literally, my nick is a pun.
/me gives Sweetie_Belle a berliner
Deceptive_Cadence: the best pun out of FiM :D
Deceptive_Cadence: I know. :D
It's weird, I've been using this nick for ages
Way before FiM
It's a fun coincidence.
Irish_Pony: cool
Deceptive_Cadence: spoooky :O
My nick is two letters long. Just so you know.
Om: You're such a terrific liar, Ommy. :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeGjTiUqw8U&feature=autoplay&list=UUXfFigwsMFiU3tYurgr9SOQ&playnext=2 meow meow meoew NYAN CAT!!!!!
Mostly because the username Cadence was already taken so I just used smilar musical terminology
And it stuck
GilDash: How was that a lieeeeh!?
Ha, that's good. :P Didja know there's actually a deceptive cadence in This Day Aria? :P
Deceptive_Cadence: really great coincidence :)
Om: Your nick's Ommy while I'm around, that's why. ;)
Om GilDash has a point
/me is Bronystate's resident nobody :3
sooooooo as anyone in here ever saw tonight's movies ? :|
Nope
GilDash: No its not Om. O(1) m(2) still Om no my.
Om: Ommykins. :)

QuickThinker: yep
sigh

Om: interesting :)

sergio_scriptor: Because if you know, I spread anyting but peace xD
killerpony7733: I already made that joke. :D

Ninjazz: You rack a disaprine
Where?
:c
You all are silly. :D
Ninjazz: You just got a 100% decrease in stealth
Ninjazz: What you did there, is like yelling sneak attack. To sneak attack
Ninjazz: Of course. Would we be the same otherwise? :)
but if you don't yell Sneak attack, you don't get sneak attack bonuses
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ona7QYULRVE&feature=related <--- ALL MR T commercials with Snickers. XD
That was the very antithesis of sneaking. :P
Om: Wow... you actually hit the nail on the head for once. :D
Oh there you are Ninjazz...don't sneak up on my like that, I'll have a heart attack.
morning :) well actually good afternoon :P
EggWhite: :D

GilDash: I've seen his work and can only say I'm impressed. :)
Ninjazz: that would be me ninny sir
Ninjazz GilDash: Quiet >_> you know nothing

Deceptive_Cadence: I can smell you OuO
Lunar_Brony /)
11,02sergio_scriptor: You can apply for it and go through the usual recruitment process you would find for any other job position...but we currently aren't looking for anymore people to hire on staff.

/me has his plot nommed on D:
11,02Moooooo O~O
what did i miss? I was crying manly tears
I feel I might add a Meet the Pyro frame to my background rotation
SuperBrony64: Moooo :3
ACS13123: pyroland or crapworld ? :)
SuperBrony64 you lagging slightly?
ACS13123 do you know how to get one of those on Windows XP?
ACS13123 pyroland is AMAZING
11,02Lagging? O.o
sergio_scriptor Pyroland probably. The other is Downtown Teufort
Do you believe in magic?
/me believes in magic
SuperBrony64 yeah took you a few minutes to react to being nommed on and mooing
TheMaster: maybe....
In a young girls heart~?
That song is unreasonably catchy
you know what my greatest wish for tf2 is ? for valve to bring back the civilian class from ttf classic :(
03o.o
tf classic *
sergio_scriptor: dunno, what game mode would it work in, I mean with all the waepons, you could just kill you and kill you and kill you oVo
sergio_scriptor what would the civillain class do
Is the stream dead again?
sergio_scriptor there is a possibility. The evidence is in the coding: there is a "Civilian" class and Announcer line in the game
it's just unused
11,02Chrysalis: I'm doing other stuff right now as well ><
SuperBrony64 Like being a silly filly?
SuperBrony64 ah, fair enough, hope its all ok
Lunar_Brony: i realy wish they would bring him back,like "the civlian update" and he get a meet the civilian or something :)
I take it the stream's down for the moment, since nobody answered my question.
sergio_scriptor Valve has been hinting at it since the first Halloween update
MrBen: indeed

14and a USB cable for my 3DS
14I usually charge it via laptop
Here is ze FAQ http://www.bronystate.net/faq/
If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose if it's jug band music or rhythm and blues.
8,6we have an faq?
Vordox: you are like a shadow :O

What I do IMissOsamaBrony ? :'(
I should say I just got back to get free greetings a feel important :)

14but it takes a lot of time, so I was wondering if I can use the AC USB adapter and the USB cable without setting my house on fire?
Vordox i forgot ya drawin
ill do it tonight
IMissOsamaBrony: I know
IMissOsamaBrony: Knew you wouldn't draw it. :)
And here is the FBI's website http://www.fbi.gov/

Uhh, thanks?
Vordox its not that i dident draw it, its that i forgot
EggWhite: that is...random ?
IMissOsamaBrony: I know that
EggWhite, are you trying to tell me something?
True I don't even live in the USA.
Vordox ill draw it eventually
:( i cant belive that i just became a brony i should have been one longer
IMissOsamaBrony: Why do you think I told you shouldn't do it? :)
Vordox cuz friendship is magic?
Night_Mare I know that feel bro. I became a brony 1 week before the S2 finale
Kammerjuck no of course not. Applejack_Pokerface.svg
:P
Night_Mare: Ya its a nice place here :)
IMissOsamaBrony: Nope. I'm a person who has the reality into math and logic
Very few things I cannot foresee. :P
Vordox what is reality? 6_9
Night_Mare: i am a brony since august or july form last year :)
SWAGGOT
IMissOsamaBrony: The reality of the world, yours or mine?
mine cuz i can be in your reality
I am my very happy 3rd day brony day :)
that made no sense ^

this is my second day of being a brony
CompressedTyme: It does
IMissOsamaBrony: Heh, nice knot around the reality topic.

Twice on bronyfunds and he may have done this before on this stream but I could be wrong. Bad memory.
hi alexxm, my days gone pretty good. I figured out a new art style XP

alexxm I'm fine, thank you.......and i have my tissues ready <----------
What did I miss?
This is great to listen to while drawing
Dawww
Oh I see, this is basicly, every bronie's dream?
Am I the ONLY one who doesn't cry during hearing/reading this?
Human finds little pony?
Shhh
Wait, is this recorded? :o
don't spoil
CallofLukey: oh hell yes you know it
Doing a Civical Education homework while hearing this is very good
DrHobo: I haven't cried or felt different and this is my first time hearing this
I'm sitting here at work... waiting for someone to come over and review some code...
i want a pony
DrHobo: I have no idea what this is, I assumed that much.
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW...
Diabeetus
RaveBrony: well I am recording, but I missed the beginning :(
I WANT MY OWN SCOOTALO!
Diabeetus
so many heart explosions
What game is this?
AttackWithHugs: well, supposedly the end is sad, but it's became the same thing with every Pony in human world story
So sweet.
shana: Aw D:
J/K, I know this is a fanfic read
DrHobo: Don't spoil dammit, this is a reaction chat. :P
I love how he treats it as if it's real with that amount of emotions.
brought into the depressing world our world...
/me bonks Kandarihu on the noggin
DrHobo: I saw a comic strip of it a while back. Didn't cry.
AgentKalim: I just said it's the same for tons of other stories XP
:o
This, would make a better movie then E.T.
testing chat, irrelevant ,ignore me 槑
Still a better love story than Twilight
hi evryone:)
I was kicked off the computer all afternoon. I'm finally back, but I don't have time to do what I want to do.
AgentKalim ew
Still a better story then everything.
I would LOVE for this to be a movie
/me doesn't ignore Metronome
AttackWithHugs: Why do people cry reading this? It's... okay but, just not crying worthy.
hi tjitjan
hey tjitjan
DrHobo: Not sure....
hey tjitjan hows your day been
Only thing cry worthy is "I don't want to go"
Oh, he's on crack I understand this now.
hey RaveBrony and AttackWithHugs!:)
Hey MahBoi777! :)
AttackWithHugs: To me it's like crying during Toy Story 3 :/
MahBoi777, this peace is what all true warriors strife for
Aaaaaw, how sweet. :P

DrHobo: I didn't cry during Toy Story 3.
Like he's acting nice. Who would pay to have a pet Rainbow Dash?
But of course
:3
Tennant <3
I can't keep listening to this at work - my productivity is already shot enough...
Lol. ^.^
I'll admit, the end of David tennant made me cry manly tears
That was a beautiful line
AttackWithHugs: same. But ironically, when i watched Brave a few days ago, I cried XD
DrHobo: I haven't seen it yet. How was it?
AttackWithHugs: It was good. I mean, it wasn't the best of Pixar, but really good.

Rarity is the best. But her voice acting isn't.
Rarity is the hardest character to VA, ever
;)
/me squeezes Ninjazz|Fics
:'(
operatorPony I think it is a self insert of the auther, ROBcrakerin or whatever.
CompressedTyme: Yes, everybody's a critic, but that's because all the world's a stage.
AttackWithHugs: Y? :D
Voice acting can be judged objectively, based on the similarity to the original voice, and that WASN'T good. Period.
Raritys voice is WAS too unique to copy! :D

AttackWithHugs: What is good or not for me is of little consiquence if I learn something from it :)
00,03Tune in for the Sequel!
That makes me so sad
Scoot-Scootaloo: is it gonna be now?
twilight_sprinkle: There is one. It's on the Moon. Getting there will cost you around 1000 bits, which at the current exchange rate falls in the ballpark of a lot of money.
OH NO HELL NO:'(
00,03yessir
yay
HELL NO
Sequel? O.o
:'(
>.<
Om: And that's how it's done. Sir/Ma'am, you would be a great role model
What sequel?

why is there no newsletter this week?
Kammerjunk: ill do all i can to get that money
Maybe this guy was just tripping on carbon monoxide or something, and he imagined he was with Rainbow Dash, and he's just sobering up.
00,03Rain: We have something planned for next week.
Yeah
Those 15 years were just a few hours.
sobering up in 15 years

AttackWithHugs: I'm an Om, and I doubt that. :D
Kammerjunk: although i doubt i have the health to make it in a space rocket
Braviary: We can't stop here! This is Dash-country.

Scoot-Scootaloo: I thought there was no newsletter because there are issues with the mail server. Is that really a giant conspiracy then?
twilight_sprinkle she probably put it under the floor boards. I would have. I am lazy liek that.

1000/10
/me is immune to this story and it's tear jerking tactics
I didn't cry once when reading My Little Dashie, but DAT VOICE ACTING just got to me.
It's sad, because you wanted it to be true, but then you didn't.
I've already read it, but it still makes me sad.
*claps* That was pretty good.
I rate it kinky/10

Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I said good feelings and memories. I never cried.
AttackWithHugs: Celestia touched him with her horn, and he felt "a certain want". You fill in the blanks.

100000000000/10
yeah that was some excellent VA'ing , minus Rarity, but Rarity's voice is impossible to reproduce
Om: Overplayed. :S
great reading/voice acting!
Goddammit Scoots... some of my tears werent even manly
Kammerjunk: Not like thaaaat, you silly~
All tears are manly.
And those voices...
Rarity's Voice is ONE of a Kind!!! :$

I can't believe you guys didn't read this.
Ethereal: No video links.
Sylandest: Hai... .__.
moce on and do wat
"My Little Dashie" is a story that's left well enough alone (AKA no sequal)
Kammerjunk: I had enough of the first one.
Oh he got kicked before I said it.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Are you the one reading this?
Ninjazz|Fics: Yeah, so did I, but I still knew about the "sequel".
00,03yeah
:P
with that being said, I'm gone. Seeya later!
Scoot-Scootaloo: sounds unofficailly officail
/me nuzzles Scoot-Scootaloo.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Good job then, and it's official if you're reading it.
Can't stay her any more. cried so much last time...can't cry more, my key bord's wet.
Crap. Sorry about that
Sylandest: What timeing.
Oh wow, I'm tired. Think I'll go make some coffee.
there is one flaw I see in this video he is getting resources from who knows where :/ maybe i missed it
Kammerjunk: Aye. But a story like MLD being one THE most popular stories on the ponynet, I'm sure it would have gotten ALOT of sequals.
turtlegod98: I'm here at work... there are some 15 or so people around me...
im back
i need to stop listening... NOW. I've cried 3 times... and I cannot take anymore.
Ninjazz|Fics: Fair enough. Not all fics make it to EQD, though.
I cried twice.
I win.
dat studder
Kammerjunk: True. True.
lol horseplay
Buck. .__.
I got tears in my eyes from yawning. Do I get points for that?
CallofLukey: I cried none. *I* win.
Scoot-Scootaloo: What country are you from?
Dat's cheatin', Kammerjunk.
D:
i was in bathroom, did the main hero get teleported to equestria or someth?

Ninjazz|Fics: You and Sylandest should chat :)
AttackWithHugs: My eyes waterd twice*
SRY but i lost it
CallofLukey: It doesnt matter how much you cried.
AttackWithHugs: me too
CallofLukey: Not actual crying, no demerits
Om: Ummm. I'm busy reading. >.>
Sweetie_Belle: No demerits
a tear came out a couple times
Ninjazz|Fics: Best time for everything
The person voiceacting Applejack here reminds me of Johnny Depp in "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas".
u all may have cried, but did your hearts explode???
I have no clue as to why.
:(
Om: Especially reading.
that happened too
CompressedTyme: MINE DID.
Rarity sounds indian
Rarity's even better in this one.
com
Aaaaaaaa
dat Rarity
CompressedTyme: nope.avi
my little rarity?
Ninjazz|Fics: Aye. But it would be such a fun conversation :)
But yeah she doesn't sound as good as the others.
MLR?
Rarity is better now :)
Eh...
holy Ackbar, Rarity!
Jesus that Rarity is terriblee :P
Dat Rarity needs abit improvement.^^ Better then before but just alittle bit more.

pinkies voice droped
and then pinkie's va was fired and this guy had to replace her
WHO's that?
BREATHE Scoot-Scootaloo XD
Doing PP's voice in that high pitch at PP speed is tough. I've tried.
WTH
RaveBrony: Considering how I didn't listen to her in the first... Whatever you say.
<3 Fluttershy
Rain: You maen scoots?
At least Fluttershy is amazing.
Well, this isn't a terrible Fluttershy voice.
PInkie's a man!!?!?!?!?!
Ninjazz|Fics: Oh, alright :D
WHAT DID I MISS
a mid-atlantic accent is not easy to pull off
She should be a little more quiet.
RaveBrony: Ehehe. :$
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Considering nopony lives in the ocean?
Rainbow!
Well, except for the narwhals.
Woot.
i honestly think the Rarity has oen of the most unique voice of any character from any show ive ever seen

Well, think about how many series PPG and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends got.
Hint: It's the same amount.
I'd like a bit more violence.

my sister is rlly good at the Rarity voice
00,03Well... yeah...
Her pronounciation on the normal words could improve with a bit more "poof" in her voice.
Scoot-Scootaloo: But even that had to take months of practice

I don't even know what Final Fantasy's about.
but also tremors
Oh, for f-
1,11AdamThePony: What are you talking about?
Stop buffring.
I'm had a blistering agent on them for the last six hours.
I've never played a FF past six
Mica what happened to that effect?
Kammerjunk: don't need to, tis boring scifi
Kammerjunk: Nothing that's entertaining
is final fantasy: spirits within even good?
http://img221.imageshack.us/img221/943/slytag2.png <-- Look guys, It's IMissOsamaBrony's Pony :P
13people are panicking and it isn't even the top of the hour...
buffer NOOOOOOOO Dx
I don't even own a console.
/me panics and jumps back into air vent to hide where
...I think.
seven was when they started getting all... anime
The URL of the Dramatic Reading we listened to not long ago.
Final Fantasy is about beign repetative and keeping ancient game mechanics.
THIS MOVIE HAS LESS THAN ZERO TO DO WITH THE GAMES!
Freefall: From what I hear, no, not really.
hows it going Orange_peel
Exactly
Shizuka: People need to stop startin.
Thats a good thing.
But we'll see for ourselves, ya?
Spirits Within I mean
Looks like I won't be missing much
yes... it helped me creating the true religion
1,11I don't know, I wasn't here for it.
:[
Damn.
What RX said.
13oh right spirits within tonight
RX-78-SweetieBot: it's also NOT entertaining
13may as well put that on screen two
Freefall29: It's cool, the special effects are great, but the story... Meh
I'm looking forward to it, at least!
I've never beaten six, actually
Well it turns out there is some signal down here :) not sure who's but I'm using it :P
better get some popcorn
It'll take me forever to find that damn video
I'm just playing God hand :)
I hear it's really good
Freefall29 = It's a decent sci-fi movie. It was just really expensive and poorly marketed
yes its good... it helped me creating the true religion
Freefall29: Still it's a good movie and fun ^^
but it can never keep my attention past the part with the moogles in the intro
is it even based on a specific final fantasy game?
Vordox MAH PONY AHHHHH PANICING
I remember enjoying 6
No.
Hey guys!
this buffer is soo long DX
trollhunter: Doing pretty well; hope to watch a fair bit of the con tomorrow on Everfree Radio.

Freefall: No. Completely original.
don't forget ponies ( desktop ponies or MST3K pony version ^^)
12lol
Ugh, Final Fantasy
Ah.
3 was fun but hard as balls
I should try finding it again and playing it to see if I still like it

I honestly think FF6 was the best of the bunch
hai Magic
one thing JRPGs never seem to get right for me is difficulty curve
they always swing too easy (Chrono Trigger) or too hard (FF3)
I didnt like 2, but I need to try 3 and 4
2 minutes.
still can be fun though

I suggest Penny Arcade On The Rainslick Precipice of Darkness Episode 3
Most jrpgs I've played usually require you to grind a shit ton for the last 1/6th of the game or so

Kandarihu: big budget that bombed
PREPARE FOR BOREDOM!
THIS IS GONNA BE JAAAAAWSUM!
are the MST3K portraits new
Shizuka: most of the Final Fantasy games have nothing to do with each other
HI PONIES

If a character does nothing the entire show, people will ship the,.

is this rifftrax version?
Oh boy.
IMissOsamaBrony: NO U
if a character is literally an inanimate rock, people will ship them
WAT MOVIE IS THIS
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The total production time on the film was over four years. By the time the final shots were rendered, some of the earlier ones had to be redone because they didn't match anymore. Also, the software used to create them had become more advanced (and hence more detail was possible).
HAI EVERYPONY
Shizuke: xD
Square Pictures.
Hey all.
/me Eats popcorn.
WOAH
Fialy fantasy
not even exaggerating
I watched this when it first came out and I was into Final Fantasy 6/3US.

Oh no!! THe trivia! :D
oooh I know this...
DSNesmith: OTP, right there.
otakon hot yes or no ? http://derpy.me/GT0E9
Final FANTASY!
Kandarihu: the budget pretty much determines if its an A movie or not. even if the movie in question was Disaster movie, it has a massive budget
hiya Randomnerd
I was so freakin' confused.

/me cellphone goes off
Michael: i already have popcorn, i've just watch ice age 4 at cinema :D

We know it sucks, get over it ! :p
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Eh, I still would.
This blows, I had to skip BronyCon.
it was worth a try
OH GOD
Groogle: Welcome aboard! Ye best have yer sealegs ready :)
I see ponies at the bottom . . . LoLz
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Fox did the same thing in the Brutal Roar series
This movie was OK in my opinion, 7.5/10
Yet is still looks worse then a studio Ghibli film
if u think this movie sucks THEN DON"T WATCH IT
/me turns on his cell phone >:3
DSNesmith: if a character gets one second in the entire series, people will ship them.

Meanwhile /)

The movie got average critical reception. The fans weren't so keen on it though
dammit, why can't I stream this right?

TheGreatAndPowerfulT: (\
Goddamn pretty androgynous males

But... Celestia as my Witness, I'll never miss BronyCon AGAIN!

Earh!
Oh hey, I remember this
she is the chosen one
And hellooooo all you wonderful people of Fluttershy. :)
its almost like theres gonna be discord all around the world
The only difference between this movie and the games is that it takes place on Earth and doesn't have Moogles, Chocobos, or any other fantastic races that are common to the franchise at the time.
0,14why does her voice sound so familiar?
the main character is Twilight
you lady can save the world in 1000years
Randomnerd: I'd settle for a fake one atm.
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
Implying Earth isnt dead already?? ;)

Isn't this that thing where people use solar shotguns?

It's good to be back. :P
hai Jaketehsnake
1,11RANDOM MOVIET RIVIA: After shooting and initial animation wrapped, completed scenes were fed to Square Pictures' custom and homemade "render farm" computer network (which consisted of 960 individual Pentium III-933MHz workstations) and processed into single frames. During this rendering process, the raw animation had the textures and extremely fine detail added by the network cluster.
1,11Each frame has twice the resolution of a high-definition TV signal and contains 10 megabytes of data.

I smell a witch
It's not a torch
Here I am, head the size of a planet, and they ask me to take you to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cause I don't.
You'll see
Silverscreen except the kinky suit man :P

Lober?
Not scary.

omg I'm actually here @_@
when I was a kid and saw this I thought it was live action... now as an adult I cant belive how stupid I was. Granted, this was probably the nicest graphics ever seen at the time
...and the fucking loud Flare gun!
00,10Sneak around> fire off flares every 20 feet
OH SHIT
Silverscreen: We're building flares that can scream?
Ohman more fireworks

My day has been full of teh sucjk... My boss had to juive me a jump start
pretty fine alexxm. A bit headache at work but genearrly not bad
My stream is still freezey. :I
Entertaining at most.
o
moin Lil :D
it looked pretty fantastic
It may not be Final Fantasy but I still think it's better than the last 12 or 13 years of Final Fantasy, barring FF12.
Shizuka: Used to build in GMod. Then Minecraft happened.
THIS movie has an ORBITAL FRIENDSHIP CANNON
Mist?
Invisible monster~
Shizuka: Eh, I don't even shoot. I just hurl ragdolls around.
13true
So how the hell is the lottery going to work if we don't get the newsletters this week?
!
1,11DeadlyPon3: Just add the technology to any Halloween costume and you're set.
these "scares" are as predictable as doom 3
what did that do
Yes you are, hello. :P

00,10if you listen closely you can hear them moan "ponies"
Spooks.
ZE HORRORS
aperture pls
I'm surprised with the graphics they've been pulling out of source lately. Portal 2 looked quite good for still being on such an aging engine.
invisible monsters sure would suck
Garr it's an evil monster
this movie looks.............
I didn't get a newsletter either.

stupid google chrome is messing up my audio at random times :(
and then everyone losed their shit
Boring and plain
This will make a perfect fanfic.

Why did she go down there?

Gello
It's just not a very good movie.
Shizuka: lol
but then, i was stopped... with all my stuff.... i was griefed... i was killed... my hopes shattered..
SolairePony89: you guess wrong. They'll do it the way they did before we had a newsletter.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: This was the first Final Fantasy not scored by series composer Nobuo Uematsu, the man behind the music of all ten FF games (excluding Final Fantasy Tactics, composed by Masanari Iwata/Hitoshi Sakimoto). His music is so loved by fans that it is often released on separate CDs by popular demand.
haha
Shizuka LEAVE THE BRONX
lol Shizuka
Shizuka: NO! :[
Fight Item Flee!
00,10you know what this is right here.......... Teamdeathmach
otakon search your feelings, you know it to be true
the fuck was the point of that?
Also, next time you're going into a potentially hazardous situation, you might want to bring along some armor. Even a freaking elbow pad would be better than a jumpsuit
You are ordered to LEAVE THE BRONX
Who are you going to call?
my reputation.... destroyed
Gasp!
Oh god... I want to land in one of those green thingies
That's cool
I meant a MLP fanfic.

DeadlyPon3 = You'll see soon enough

I mean... it's almost like they just took a bunch of random-ass action scenes and threw them together
Team Deathmatch
Silverscreen: that cant be good, Uematsu made excellent music
TEAM DEATH MATCH
inb4 SHE KILLS DEM
VII probably
IshBestPony: None of them, apparently.
I tried internet explorer, yuck, and the audio is fine but the chat doesn't work. Stupid ancient laptop.

Ah, the ghosts are creatively called "Phantoms"
Hello everybody? How are you doing tonight? I'm doing very good and I just saw 21 Jump Street; hilarious.

Shizuka: Moogles, Bahamut, weapon/armor names, classes, airships, summons
Spade-Magnes[R]: No relation to the games
:(
/me nuzzles Invi back anyway
Everytime they shoot the gun someone screams.
No shit.
Shizuka: By the crazy hair logic, every JRPG ever is related :P
And Peri Gilpin
how is this final fantasy?
I'd poke holes in this plot if u know what I mean
Oh noes
NO HORSEAPPLES!
RELAX
Shizuka: lots of stuff

Happy music!

Are they aliens or humans?
Pew pew pew
SolairePony89, If that's so A Flock of Seagulls was the first ever Western RPG!
Wait, game, what game?
Shizuka: yeah, but they show up in a lot of games

Hmm, resking your life for aplant. Sounds familuar
Doctor Oki.

that's just the name I gave it
AKUUU
SolairePony89: I dislike most since so few try to make their shitty turn-based combat interesting.
Mr Conductor's the Villan!
xP
She's a doctor, all her actions are accounted for.
and hey beta
Shizuka: Yup
this black guy prolly die in this movie
Well, damn
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Dr. Aki Ross' hair is only half as dense as the average human crop, however, that still left 60,000 strands to put realistically into motion. When designing the computer graphics, a fifth of the time spent was devoted to those 60,000 hairs.
It means " Shit "
heyya
xD
Then you should not chase her.
The last of the pot
/me smells like Amethyst Dragon? :)
LOL
She's a man!

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Prior to the film's release, there was speculation that the photo-realistic computer-generated "actors" would revolutionize moviemaking. There were news reports of plans for the "digital actress" used for Aki Ross to appear in another movie, or possibly be included in a live-action production amongst real actors. The box office failure of this film put those plans
1,11on hold, however a special sequence created for the special edition version of the DVD, which opens disc 2, does in fact show Aki and other FF characters interacting with real people.
That went well for them. :D

HE'S THE BAD GUY YET IF YOU HAVEN'T FIGURE IT OUT

traitor? who would betray their species to fucking aliens?
Dat BOOBS
aka into her breast
Chest... *snort*
Bewbs!
the empire wasn't entirely cartoonishly evil
he want dem boobs
all he needs is a twirly mustache and an eye patch
DSNesmith: What do you mean, "by the time of A New Hope"? The films start there.
I mean, there's no real bonus for him to blow them up opposed to just sciencing them to death.
She is dying. But she will live because she is important to the story.
HOW DARE YOU NOM ME?!
Necrophile?
Freefall29: Spirits Within
What's his motivation?
Freefall29: Bioshock isn't shit, so Final Fantasy
Dat another boobs
What panel. The fuck are they talking about?
DEM BOOBEHS.
Sex!!!!
Titanium forged BOSOMS
twilight_sprinkle: Nonsense is nonsense. Don't tell me you're trying to defend nonsense. :p
Freefall29: neither. it is spirits within
at the lower levels of the empire's administration, it was just a new system of order
BANG
He's ha doctor, not a pervert
SPIRITUAL SEX
03bakc
CriticKitten: how about they use a tissue to set the light wave properties like amplitude and frequency for their lasers
Rape Time :P
Love intrest my boy
Fuck her FOR SCIENCE
SolairePony89: now I want to play Bioshock again

lol
Jspang1: the "hero" of Avatar
we need to do science! with magic! call twilight sparkle!
I was being sarcastic people. this feels more like bioshock, and less final fantasy
His ponos in her vagoo
Now rape her
otakon: i love bioshock
Avatar feelings.
CriticKitten: its not impossible because we dont know what tech they have
/me noms DeadpoolDash
Is it me or does the captain look like Ben Affleck
It feels like I'm watching climatic scenes from an FPS
lol
ohshit this is gonna get srs
otakon: I've played though the game at leat 7 times. Fun every playthrough
DSNesmith: except for the you know RUTHLESS IRON FIST OF OPRESSION

Ouch.
TrixieBaconMuffin: that... is a valid point
night night
lol
DAFAQ
Freefall29: not bioshock cause there is no atlas or that one Andrew Ryan
except that whole "ruthless fist of oppression" wasn't the empire's main modus operandi
twilight_sprinkle: Let's review....they claim they're using human tissue to power their lasers. That makes no sense. "We don't know what tech they have" isn't a good enough reason to stop calling bullshit on that.
SURPRISE!
Oh look a full moon.
LUNA
Dat moon
was I nomed
twilight_sprinkle: CriticKitten: this argument of yours is going too long. Just enjoy the movie.
MINDFUCK
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In an earlier version of the script, Cid and Aki were originally grandfather and granddaughter. Aki's last name was also different: she was originally Aki Shishido. The relationship and names were changed late enough into production that many of the animators and staff didn't even know of the modification of the script until the film was nearly finished.
spaaaaaaaaaaaaace
Now lean over SLOWLY....
it is in the movies, sure, cause they focus on the big superweapons
U SEE LUNA
There's science fiction and then there's gibberish. :p
StinkomanFan: Yeah, but his whatever-the-hay levels, man! They were off the CHARTS!
*now
DSNesmith: SITH MODUS OPERANDI
Freefall29: and not set in the 1950s
and palpatine was a bloody idiot
magic
You don't say.
so some how they get in her brain even though they are just holding hands BULLSHIT
how?
otakon: what?
BUTTSECKS!
The human in the moon part 1
but at the level of the planetary governors
So is this a dream?
Yeah pretty much
it was a pretty sane system
lol
07ohai
LUNA
This is science FANTASY. Huge difference.
Now lean forward...
This movie is making less sense by the minute...
TessHM: Dis is spr srs bsns u gaiz
07so
AHHHHH LUYNA
Bronysith: SITH WORK OFF OF ANGER AND HATRED
07yeah
She has a dream, but Martin Luther King she ain't.
otakon: The implication is that the "core" worlds had it okay, like in Firefly
and the extra restriction was what prevented constant conflict like the republic had
its a memory
CriticKitten: you cant prove its gibberish. people often build technology in immitation to nature
ok
INCEPTION!
Dream? What is this dream you speak of?
Luna's in coming!
wait
Dream about buttseks
The will meet Luna soon
otakon: righto
Kinky...
TimtheBrony: That's how Final Fantasy is
Great.
...
and she just goes along with it
D:
Remedy: Cures Poison, Frog, Dark, Petrify, Slow, and uh.... I forget
Im totally confused by the talk about Spirits
awww skeetskeet
Bronysith: yeah, not exactly good emotions
it sounded like he just said "You see a pretty plot"
there were a few nice decades of total peace before the rebellion sprung up
She don't give a shit.
dat weed
07the panasonic is way better in pretty much everything but megapixels
DSNesmith: Seriously, man, you're freaking me out. You're talking like there's something BEFORE A new hope.
and even then it was just rebellion vs empire
dat sarcasm
DON'T CRUTH IT MORON

A New Hope*
blindly picking words from the dictionary
Doesn't mah acting show that?
Now snort it
Kammerjunk, Medochlorines

I wouldn't be surprised by that.

Kurra: Remedy pretty much cures everything
Kammerjunk: Episodes 1 through 3
Phantom, haha :D
CriticKitten: 2 thousand years ago people would think it gibberish to do the things we do today
StinkomanFan: Yeah, that's their names.
MY GOD THAT JACKET IS EPIC
WASSAP
Come on buttseks
there were no real conflicts during the empire's reign
MUST GET JACKET
03OK
HAHAHAH
Well that's BAD news
Remedy doesn't cure KO, Curse, or Zombie! D:
She's under the influence of drugs.
00,10Still find it funny this movie bombed so hard they had to make porn with the software inorder to recoop the losses.
She's UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE PHANTOMS!
That chin touching
...because they killed them.
This should of been a vidja game
03and really, I question how good the lenses really are
AWWWWWWWWWWSKEETSKEET
Oh and Stone.
if it had been handled by someone a bit less looney than palpatine the empire would have been a much better government than the new republic
STROKING THE BEARD YOU DONT HAVE!
/me strokes chin
03even on the 14MP Panasonic I tried hte other day
the hampster's are spinning
wait wait wiat. IS THERE a star wars flame war going on? I WANT IN
Nobody wants to be a jedi anymore
03with no optical zoom
no wait I said that already, Petrify.
also it's prohuman doctrine was a bit limiting
what about destroying all trhat could be used against her didn't she understand..
Sumica: They did? That's pretty hilarious. :D
Off topic, does anyone know what the B-movie this week is?
Ew, alien crotch
*its
51 minutes to finish the downloading of sonic adventure 2 batle to my pc Yay
Arcness: A MAN CAN DREAM!
Sumica: It didn't bomb for me, I like this movie
Seriously, Sumica?
yes she is obvioulsy under the influence of the phantoms that looks NOTHING like what we just saw from her recordings. LOGIC!
twilight_sprinkle: The problem with that logic is that it's using something that CAN'T power a laser to power a laser.
00,10eeeeyup
What the aliens.
Dream..cast
It's not, I already checked.
CupcakeWarrior: Yeah, A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.
1,11....
Empire is better than republic
Get ready to do something incredibly stupid, Major.
ROFL SUmica
SEEEGAAAAAAAAA
Expecially since an empire cannot afford to ignore a talent.
so...the aliens are fighing the aliens?
RAPE HORDE
but inevitably when the republic takes over things fall apart in years
ALIEN VS PREDITOR
03which I'm guessing is just a remnant of the high resolution?
there is no stupid ass 90000 member senate
WHATS POKING ME
Another stampede?
he's prolly shitting himself
The technology used in making this movie would go to a better use making porn.
Alien wars.
Well, programmers gotta eat.
GANG BANG

Sumica: Learn something new every day
LETS HUG
the empire has better technology
it's the age old "freedom vs. safety" thing
Ded
1,11This is now Alien Warfare: the movie/video game
Oh god
Gangsta aliens
He's scared.
THEY LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME
Sumica, that's sad of this movie. :'(
Oh man
otakon: Seems like it
07do you know the model of that one
Now look up.
CriticKitten: maybe it doesnt literally power it so much as set the required frequency and amplitude of the light waves like i mentioned before
OH CANTEROT WEDDING PG+13 VERISON!
CATALYST INCOING
03ZS19
It should be obvious by now what happened

Geth
8,6pretty sure it's been done actually
thanks to shit like the Vong and the Ssi-Ruuk
I am me.
DAMN IT DEATHWING
Everbody dead!
twilight_sprinkle: A logical equal to this would be if I said that you can't PROVE that it's impossible to make a gun that shoots bees instead of bullets. Sure, you can't prove it, but you can probably call bullshit on it. Given that it's nonsensical and stupid.
TAC NUKE!!!
god dam haxors
Yeah
8,6yep
AHHHHH
03and literally the ONLY difference I see is that it's 14MP, not 12, and it has a touchscreen

Oh mai god a crazy dream.

DSNesmith: Im currently trying to get my hands on the last of the three about the bugs that happens after the vong wars.

spiritKirz: I remember going to see it. I was all "WTF? Where's Cloud or Squall?" :D

No.
DSNesmith: i just count the OT and KoToR canon
Ackey.
03oh
the early EU ones are really bad
HER NAME IS AQUI
In the vein of John Carter and Treasure Planet, it's one of the biggest Box office bombs of all time that didn't quite deserve this massive of a financial failure. Although I do enjoy this much more than John Carter.
CriticKitten: pf, are you actually saying a gun liek that is impossible
all the one-shots
Really? That's good because WE don't
