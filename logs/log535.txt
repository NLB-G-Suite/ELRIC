I've already read it, but it still makes me sad.
*claps* That was pretty good.
I rate it kinky/10
Friendship/10

Rainbow Dash's voice acting was nearly spot on.
9001/10

100000000000/10
yeah that was some excellent VA'ing , minus Rarity, but Rarity's voice is impossible to reproduce
great reading/voice acting!
All tears are manly.
And those voices...
Rarity's Voice is ONE of a Kind!!! :$
welp, that story was thoughly dissapointing. I was promised tears and all I got was a bunch of people crying at something that shouldnt be cried at
<3

At least Fluttershy is amazing.
Well, this isn't a terrible Fluttershy voice.
PInkie's a man!!?!?!?!?!
a mid-atlantic accent is not easy to pull off
She should be a little more quiet.
Rainbow!
