That picture on the box looks very un-trixie
twilight_sprinkle: I'll take that DVD if you don't want it.
she cute :3
sagas: Yeah no kidding.
twilight_sprinkle http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py_IndUbcxc&feature=related
What surprises me is, Trixie is in only one episode. . .You incude an episode in which she isn't in.
Everlasting_Joy: sure, i know easier ways to get things, muahahahahahaha
It's not getting "Boast Busters" I'm refering to, it's that fact that BB isn't included with Trixie.
Wait, Nazi from the moon!?
Is that sarah palin?
Everlasting_Joy: i expect shell be in an ep in s3, where shell turn out to be just unconfident
Everlasting_Joy: which is why shes my third fav pony :D
twilight_sprinkle: Personally, I'm hoping for a revenge/forgiveness tale.
twilight_sprinkle what do you think
alexxm: hard to discern anything in particular from the trailer, it looks crazy but fun (teehee)
twilight_sprinkle of course it is its sarah palin vs moon nazis
alexxm: idk who sarah palin is :S
twilight_sprinkle she would have been mckanes vs president had he won the women from alaska
alexxm: ook, i dont really follow politics :P
alexxm: politiks are eviiil

hey pipsqueakthepirate hows your day been
diddutz: Le gasp! You wouldnt dare! o.o
RaveBrony: I thought so.
Can't complain, <3 weekends
Sounds like I'm just in time for something awesome :)
Hey pipsqueakthepirate :P
Howdy MegaMoonShine.
Everlasting_Joy: Haha :D
alexxm: A sadfic. Going for manly tears this time. That's all you're getting :D
also twilight_sprinkle I'm now thinking of Twilight coloured sprinkles
twilight_sprinkle: .. it's a good thought:
pipsqueakthepirate: the best kind of sprinkles!
Baka-Neku: you present?
Guess not.
Anyone here going to the edinburghbronie meetup on the 14th of july?
'fraid not
^
savin up for the BUCK convention
nope, anypony here watching Breaking Bad?
poo on a stick ~_~
diddutz: That show is really good apparently
FairysHuff: Nope, it sounds like it's across the pond, and I can't go.
diddutz, good show!
diddutz: Haven't watched it before though
MegaMoonShine, Everlasting_Joy: ikr? But i can't find an amc stream for the last season ...
How many seasons does it go again?
I MIGHT go to that Galacon in Stuttgart, though.
CountDoofus where are you from?
diddutz: K, then I haven't a clue as to where they would be. I know Netsticks (Netflix) has S1-3, but I'm not sure if they've updated yet.
who didn't like zombie land and why didn't you like it
Lil_B: Belgium.
CountDoofus oh ok
Dead IN A swimming pool.
yeah.
Thats actually news.
Pssh. Details.
Lol
Personally I don't really care but I know some of you will.
better than celebrity babies and politicians
twilight_sprinkle: :D
^
ive never even heard of him
He was the victim of police brutality.
Though it's hardly big news we must remember that this was a living person and show some respect. Come now... I'm sure we can do better. We're bronies after all.
and Racism.
twilight_sprinkle he got beaten by cops in 92
blah racism.
when people complain about racism they only induce racism
His beating by four police officers and their acquittal the following year sparked riots
yep.
Side note: Such beatings are still common
twilight_sprinkle, maybe, but it still exists.
11,02dis channel
I can see how easy it is to confuse that these days though.
/me knows all too well.
WallDives: Hey, I know too. My damned dad. :S
This is the best stream I've ever seen 10/10
But thats not my point. We shouldn't joke about someones death.
:p
twilight_sprinkle: There are still people out after them too, you know. Now, I don't agree with all this PC bullshit these days, but I acknowledge that there is still a problem.
hi Polydunami.
I recently saw a video of a police officer shooting an un armed man in the head in a station.
GilDash: the only way to beat racism is to ignore it. "racism" shouldnt be considered a crime because it draws attention and creates racism
Hey WallDives :3
twilight_sprinkle, that is not true.
And hello everypony else
GilDash: a murder is a crime, racism is just another insult. the fact that its considered a crime only emphasizes racism
hey Polydunmai hows your day been
Howdy Polydunami!
WallDives: why not.
It's 9 in the morning...
actually, no, I refuse to indulge in this conversation.
Hai Polydunami
good bye.
twilight_sprinkle: If somebody goes out and kills someone just because they're black, we should just ignore that?
People people! Remember the rules of this site!
GilDash: like i said, the Murder is a crime, not the reasoning
And it's a busy day for me.
I think we should stop... people are getting a bit heated about this.
twilight_sprinkle: That's just ignorance.
twilight_sprinkle: You can't just sweep this shit under the rug.
Lil_B: discrimination isnt illegal as far as i know, and when people blame it on racism it only creates racism. it should be a crime only when it causes illegal actions
I will be busy for the next few hours and I think I'd better head out right now.
I agree FairysHuff, this is starting to get out of hand
I'm out
Though I've noticed everyone has missed the point of the post. That it is sad that someone has lost their life. Everyone is focussing on the wrong thing.
Tata Poly|AFK|
Bye Poly|AFK|
guyz there shutting down ponibooru :{{{{{{{{{{{{{{
or is it old news
twilight_sprinkle: Discrimination is *very* illegal. It's in the damned Human Rights charter.
GilDash: it would work way better then making a big deal out of every little nit of racism
00,10man you all get grim with out a stream.
Hello everyone
My flash player crashed. . .
twilight_sprinkle: No, it wouldn't. People'd just go back to what they did before, and that was entirely unacceptable.
Sumica, ikr
Howdy Cobellanez.
*Face hoof* (\ And so it continues.
Hello Cobellanez
>_(\
Sumica: lack of stream causes politiks discussions >:
Happy Father's Day, if anyone here is a father
twilight_sprinkle Discrimination IS a Crime by Law, and Racism ISN't a crime (I messed that up in my previous statement), but all the action "Discrimination, violence, etc) are Crimes caused by Racism
Cobellanez working on it
GilDash: crimes would still be crimes, that should be the focus, not a pursuit in racism
I find it interesting that people are completely ignoring the fact that some one has died in order to argue politics. O_o This is sad.
*on
FairysHuff: were not ignoring it, we just moved on
uuuh huh.... >_>
FairysHuff who died?
FairysHuff: This is life. The little stuff gets looked over. When you've heard about death everyday, you become desensitised to it.
*Sigh* I am also out now. I'm not getting drawn into this mess
Doesn't make it right, just how it is.
Lil_B: when people focus on racism it only emphasizes it
Ping me when this conversation is done.
00,03Happy Father's Day everyone! Hope you hugged your dad!
twilight_sprinkle: It is quite clear we have a difference in opinion. I'm not debating this further.
And to you too Scoots!
Everlasting_Joy thats true
00,03Oh, looks like there's an argument going on, let me fix that~
GilDash can you tell me who died?

Scoot-Scootaloo: My dad is deeeeaaaa- Oh wait, no, he's just a long ways away.
also hi Scoot-Scootaloo
twilight_sprinkle: Only when approached with an open mind. I refuse to believe that racism should just be glossed over, so I am dropping it here.
Lil_B: I don't even remember. That is how sad these things are. :(
racism? BAH
GilDash oh :(
GilDash: well you need to debate these things to actually come to a correct conclusion
Moo?
growl.
GilDash: i just find my view logical and practical, id accept a different one if it made more sense to me
woof
twilight_sprinkle: Correct is relative. I'm not biting further.

08,01Polydunami: i'm... already Asian
You watching the ball game, hen3ry?
/me 08,01is half Indian
Technically I'm listening to it... too cheap to buy the TV package. :D
I am half insanity and the other half awesome
Which game, hen3ry?
08,01i'm confuuuuuuuuuuuused
Angels vs DBacks
08,01sagas: it's a wonderful place, so long as you've not grown up there
You got it set up yet, Nittany_Discord?
/me rolls off a cliff for awhile
Alright, you?
08,01sagas: certain parts stink, certain parts don't
Can someone ping me please? I'm seeing if I set up XChat properly.
08,01just like the western world
Stream down?
/me hugs OtakuTom :3
OtakuTom: ping?

GASP STREAM

08,01sagas: but if you're eveer in Hyderabad, never *ever* go near the Cow Sanctuary, if you value your nasal sanity
I see the stream is up right now
It's not down. But I am
Well...it highlights the text properly, but it's not playing sound :(
Is that you, Nittany?

OtakuTom gets sent to the moon
Something's gonna happen!? :O

14good
08,01sagas: seriously though, India is a wonderful place, and i recommend going
08,01sagas: i'll be going at some point next year, wanna come with me?
11,01Go Indiana.
XD
One more try please?
Suddenly RD
OMG Rainbow Dash :D
Do the mods have regular streaming times or is it just random?
She hates losing just sayin
So guys, in the first episode, Twilights books say "the stars will aid in her escape" in regards to Nightmare Moon. And wee see 4 stars do just that. What does that meen you think?
08,01it'll be awesome
I've been to quite a few places in Asia before. Never been to India though
Rex_Mundi: It means they meant it literally?
08,01killerpony7733: i really do!
Little kids often take things very literally, so...
and given the target demographic.
hen3ry: yup
Denmark, if its like The Neatherlands, is awesome
08,01the only things i know about denmark are that it has good cheese, gay marriage, and legal bestiality
08,01and salami
Denmark is just like The Neatherlands, right?
lol :D
08,01oh, and the pastries
SAW THE GAME!
I saw what u did there...
Saw...oh god I lov this game
SAW! here we go!
08,01GilDash: well, you live in the UK, so we could take the same flights
3 person India trip!
08,01Elondras: it's very clean, has great chocolate, and a lot of cows
i guess i Saw this comign
Just saying
saw has a game?
/me 08,01has been walking in the Swiss Alps
YES
We hear you
Louder, Nittany_Discord xD
yes we hear you, but turn up your mic volume
Nittany_Discord: Your voice doesnt sound really bad
08,01Elondras: i wasn't; i was mostly in St. Luc, in the alps
Nittany_Discord: You have a lovely voice
11,01I hate my voice.
I know a Swiss family.
11,01Thanks.
hen3ry, yeah, but why did the stars aid in her escape? Did Nightmare moon do that? Or did something evil release her? Or maybe Celestia released her, knowing that Twilight and friends would use the Elements on her?
St Luc, named for the patron saint of the Enterprise?
Well that's one, Nittany
Rex_Mundi: Unknown.
Rex_Mundi: Lauren's Writers arent that bright to think of it
Nittany_Discord: YOUR VOICE DOESNT SOUND CRAPPY!
ow my ears
who's streaming
05STOP COMPLAINING YOU DOFFUSESESES
oh
Nitt is?
dat laugh
Wrek: Fine
Wait, he already started?
Rex_Mundi: All we know canonically is that Celestia used the elements to put NM on the Moon, and a prophecy prediced exactly what happened 1000 years later.
When did I miss this?
Nittany_Discord: You're voice is fine, it was just loud =p
Noclip powers Activate!
dat laugh
/me is too busy listening to Metallica to pay attention to the stream. :)
wow.. Your**
GilDash: So your done with whatever you had to do?
Rex_Mundi how did the alignment of the Stars help the Titans Greek mythology to break out of their prison and storm the Olymp? Its just something Mystical as a help to begin the story
hen3ry, we don't know who actually wrote that prophecy, do we?
Don't worry Nittany_Discord, everyone sounds weird on a mic
Polydunami: nope
My guess is that Celestia is Emporer Palpatine D:
sagas: i doubt it :$
Nittany_Discord: Can you turn up the gamma? Kinda hard to see
Polydunami: two possibilities. It was Celestia. Or it wasn't.
When I hear myself on the mic, I feel awkward :S
OMG I hate Zed
Problem?
sagas: Yes, for now. :)
I hate hearing my own voice
dery kiling them with lightning!
Derpy: SERIAL ATTEMPT KILLER
GilDash: Yay! :$
I'm back ONLY BECAUSE THIS PLACE MAKES UP MY LIFE.
And people think I sound nice :S
GilDash: Can we know what it was yet?
sagas: It's private, dear. :)
Saw: Cupcakes Edition? 0_o
GilDash: I will respect that
Pinkies4thScrew I know that feeling :/
Pinkies4thScrew, I knew you would come back
sagas: Thank you for not prying. :)
GilDash: I will restrain my curiousity
I'd add two letters to my nick, but probably get in trouble
until you affect us all eith curiousity
Diddnt Faust say at somepoint that someone evil released her? Of coarse, thats not canon.
sagas: Feel free to direct it to me personally at anytime though. ;)
DERPY!
Stop shocking him Derpy!
Get off his head, DerpY!
GilDash: Ha :D But that b=would be prying
(which i really don't care about right now, Fuck my life

Jigsaw challenge: Play and beat Super Man 64
sagas: It's fine if it's just me. ;)
nosferatu is flikering the lights again :(
Jigsaw Challenge: Make cupcakes with Pinkie
So is there any change of a good ending in this game?
*chance :S
probably not
Well
I mean, solving all those puzzles just to die in the end doesn't really bode well as far as replay value goes
DED? :P
this isn't depressing at all
Bye Nittany_Discord!

/me playes the Jeopardy theme
Shut up, and stop dying

Saw: The Game
Yo dawg I heard you like games so I put a minigame inside of your game so you can play while you play!

Derpy, put him out of his misery please.
Well, that went well
Derpy, it's not your fault
thanks Invi and MegaMoonShine
bai bai
That's right, Al - You LOST! And let me tell you what you didn't win; a 20 volume set of the Encyclopedia International. A case of Turtle Wax. And a year's supply of Rice-a-Roni, the San Francisco Treat. But that's not all - you also made yourself look like a jerk in front of millions of people. You brought shame and disgrace to your family name for generations to come!
/me pets alexxm
MegaMoonShine but that measn you will loose "The Game" while "loosing the game"
/me purrs at Invi
You don't get to come back tomorrow. You don't even get a lousy copy of our home game. You're a complete loser! (cue verse)

hen3ry I really like the funky bass in this song :)
yeah
why does this game have so many minigames
Mario Party: Saw Edition.
gamma could still go up a bit, Nittany_Discord
alexxm watch one of the movies
He tweaked the original a little I think - I don't think "(Our love's in) Jeopardy" had that much funk in its bass.
pony_1106: that's just what I was thinking :D
The Trick is, theat there is NO solution... you have to bash it with a hammer!"
No no no, Cupcakes: Saw Edition!
yay!
Polydunami: That's just what i was thinking ;D

How about just Cupcakes

Nittany_Discord: How long is this game?
and ANOTHER reason why this game isn't worth the time that's been put into it
Thanks Lil_B, you are second best pony. Only rarity is bester pony. [:
who thought a game where your health always depleates would need parts where you can't see your health
Well, when you're about to die, the game seems to quiet down. THAT's when you know.

Puzzles are evil..... lesson of this game
Jim has a liking for spitfire, eh?!
Polish spitfire is
IDIOT it's not Jigsaw...
Panda: Atleast its better than him jsut shooting himself :D

Jim well, I heard swedish peaople they that she sounds quite bitchy
Nittany_Discord: ARE YOU THERE?

well... konami... you sucked with this one
Is there a third ending?

Well I prefer the Truth -lol
Saw 2
LD

The devs are such douches
Saw sux... atleast the ends :D
Ya' get a gun >:3
Choosing freedom or truth. To have one and forever sacrifice the other.
sagas: IKR
I think it could be better the ending truth
it was going SO well
05seemed like fun :3
...
so nit finally finished :( what game is next?
Technically Freedom is the good ending
Saw 2 of course
Nittany_Discord: So what killed you exactly in the truth?
Oh... I forgot to put me legacyofvrak
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I missed what happened

Wrek: can i send you a link?
Nittany_Discord ever played Saints Row?
Nittany_Discord: the collar or did you get shot?
otakon: he insane
05sure
11,01I don't have a clue.
This game needs a third ending.
ah
so many people worked on this
11,01Played all of the Saints Row games. Only beat 3 though.
Nittany_Discord: =/
didnt he kill himself in the thruth ending too?
11,01Freedom ending was a cop-out.
both were cop outs
11,01He just walks in and kills himself. Why?
pony87535: Dat hair :O
Nittany_Discord: You like crazy games?
Tax, you here?
Lonely Survivor
Nittany_Discord: he's trapped
Nittany_Discord: you should play amnesia ^^
Quick! You are forced to watch the entirety of G3 (including G3.5 and newborn cuties), you cant joke about it and theres no watching G4 again ever after. To you watch it and go insane or kill yourself?
Nittany_Discord: He never could catch jigsaw.
Panda: he did and went crazy
11,01But you don't kill yourself over that.
Nittany_Discord well, it WAS freedom technically
05lookin nice there ;O
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: what? I WASNT HERE?
I'll watch it and love it
because of how ridicuous it is
Well I'm off now, it's pretty late
Nittany_Discord: but still there was no way out for him
check mate
Panda: ya
I'll watch it, but get really annoyed by it
Kill your family or die. choose
Family first xD
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: dammit :(
I'm going to sleep now, bye everyone
11,01It was a cop-out ending.

So Nittany_Discord What now? :)
/me hugs sagas Fou_Lou and Biglaw ;)

hugz
Neither ending is good in this one >.>
I hate giving the player to choose between 2 endings. You can just save and go back and watch the other
^^
Nittany_Discord: OH I KNOW!
Nittany_Discord: Katamari Damacy
More content, I guess :S
^
I wonder if an MLP anime would work, like what japan did with Power puff girls?
id acually like to see the other ending in games without playing it all over again sagas
Just like the movie, the game is unfair :S

Oh hey, Katamari Damacy would be a good game to stream :3
pony_2462: just like the movie it ends retarded
Also, there's an indie RPG called OFF. It's French.
Nananananana - Katamari Damacy
And BLOODY surreal
Nittany_Discord why not play a mod or Arma 2 called DayZ?
so they stayed true to the movie ^.^
of*
Biglaw: that game requires a extreme pc i think
oh
WHAT Biglaw SAID NOW!
:/
:D
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Yep. I haven't watch any of them completely (just the 4th one with some scenes), but I did read what was going on and it isn't satisfying at all :S
Biglaw: its openworld with a lot of stuff =/
Nittany_Discord: Do what Biglaw said
11,01Now it's Wrek time.

ofc it would help if I knew WHAT THE HELL THEY WERE STAYING
051 where the gasolien had leaked out on the floor where the crowd was and the ignighted, englulfign them in a quick burst of flame but not harmign anyone
oh...
wow
that would be cool
"I survived a stage fire!!!"
05the other accident iirc was jsut a faulty pipe so that instead of a row of 6 flame bursts there was 5
One hell of a story for your friends
Wrek: dayum
that's more just technical difficulties
05exactly
05also arm fire
Wrek: well, that's less of an accident and more of a malfunction, isnt it?
and now the guitarists are on fire
looks rather like their arms
are these the guys who did du hast mish?
05Videofreak1127: yes they made Du Hast

05and an animated movie
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: That sounds more like a megaman Vs then an avengers one -lol
Iron_Edge: oh ya lol
???
what just happened?
did he puke?
idoubt that
05if he did its a part of the act
that looks more like oil or maybe axel grease than vomit.
I wouldn't know
:/
Me either really -lol
Im just taking guesses.
considering he just had flamethrowers on his arms a bit ago ;)
Hey, Wrek, where do you get those ponies on the bottom corner of the screen?

Videofreak1127: Desktop ponies
Videofreak1127: Desktop POnies

Videofreak1127: Google it and download it.

Videofreak1127, you wont be able to get the blond one though
conserding they apprently set up the pyrotecnicks themselves
Why?
08,01yes, this is how people in my country actually talk: http://ompldr.org/vZWRuYw
because that is Wrek's OC and I think only he and Sumica have it
Irish_Pony: i love tf2
Bronysith: Who doesnt? :P
Irish_Pony: call of duty fans
Bronysith: I beg to differ :P

lol
Alright..
:S
|Discord| its a ramminstein concert
alexxm: I have no idea who those people are
Its a german band discord
|Discord|: i think tehy are a german rock band
|Discord| have you heard du hast
08,01i like how pixelwrek is headbanging along
alexxm: No
Bronysith: Not rock its heavy metal or something liek that
like*
05hard rock/industrosynthmetal
ya it should be rock
Fou_Lou: no way i just said that you crazy brony. hahhaha SWAG
05its a weird genre to class
btw, if anyone's wondering why they use so much fire: the bandname is a reference to the ramstein air base. during an airshow two planes collided which ended in 70 dead.
Wrek: hardrock and metal ftw
Dark_Horst: wow 70
05and the lead singer is an liscenced pyrotechnic
Dark_Horst: Honestly I just figured it was cause fire is cool.
Dark_Horst: Rammstein are god damn good at symbolizing things
Wrek: of course =/
05not all know it
DAFUQ?!
THATS AWESOME
brb
Dat lift ups
did they already play Du Hast on this set?
Zephyr: yes
Zephyr: they did
yeah Zephyr
killerpony7733: -lol dont you mean pull ups?
g'night all
Bromance
though they distanced themselce from the connection of their name and the air base for a long time. the controverse from that helped their popularity a great deal
Iron_Edge: i guess so thanks for the correction ;)
05ohne dich
killerpony7733: No I didnt mean to correct you -lol sorry.
killerpony7733: But I mean your welcome anyways I'm always happy to help haha ^-^

I am a happy brony
08,01sagas: i could probably swing us a few weeks with one of my relatives, but i'm planning on travelling around a bit and staying in hotels
08,01GilDash: you don't need to be there the whole time i am
08,01BronyState goes to India
08,01:D
08,01thing is, i'm planning on doing BUCK next year too, so i'll need to be back for that
08,01so the indian trip will probably only be 4 weeks

cowvarkian: on him
on him, cowvarkian
indeed Dark_Horst
08,01sagas: probably june/july
08,01also, bear in mind that that kind of time is *really* hot in india
[insert troll face here]
/me is tired
08,01we're talking above 40C
so, is india a "dont drink the water" kind of place?
08,01yes
08,01very much so
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: then take a nap
hotter than texas in a heat wave, and muggier than detroit on a wednesday evening :)
08,01water needs to be sterilised and filtered
xmasskills: im trying to get back into my night owl routine
08,01killerpony7733: i don't know of any other india
:P
08,01GilDash: aye
08,01sagas: indeed
water in India = Water in Mexico
Sounds interesting
just dont drink it :)
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: im already in a night owl routine but its afternoon here now
08,01sagas: that's no problem; it should be easy enough to get around. i don't speak any indian language, and i assume you're both in the same boat, but english is very widespread there
xmasskills: movie night messed up my routine but it was worth watching zombieland
I spent about two weeks in China. I know about undrinkable water.
08,01cowvarkian: botled water is sometimes dubious
Also, hey everypony :3
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: zombieland was a pretty good zombie movie
08,01cowvarkian: because people refill empty bottles from the taps
sagas: What are you guys going to india for?

0,14Nightwish?
0,14UYES
0,14YES
0,14DARK CHEST OF WONDERS
0,14I LOVE THIS SONG
/me 08,01doesn't need a visa because he has a Person of Indian Origin card
who's on now?
08,01means i'm basically an Indian citizen

Nightwish has some decent music, but the show seems.. flashy as I said :)

oh... nightwish
to bad she left. i hear she sings opera now?
0,14I love the instrumentation for this song

Videofreak1127: you missed good shit
oO my desktop ponys crashed

05left and left, they absically kicked her out for beign a diva
who all is in this concert?

i thought it was soemthing like that
05godlike voice though

Right, I'm going now. G'night. :)
Goodnight GilDash :3
we go to india, we dont die, we find him, thats it I guess killerpony7733
nigh GilDash
0,14the instrumentation for this always reminds me of something you hear in an epic boss fight
man, this shit blows my socks off. straight through the wall behind me and into the neighbours yard
seems good
Played D2 to this kind of music
08,01Iron_Edge: i'm not sure. maybe manchester again. and yes, i'll still be chairman.
This reminds me oddly of Lion King
08,01sagas: one of the London ones
08,01probably Heathrow
NIGHTWISH YESH!
They look happy.

OMG pony invasion
Videofreak1127: -lol oh wow.

Fou_Lou: quick! destroy them before they destroy us!
inb4 Videofreak1127 goes out and builds some enormous computer rig with 32 gigs of DDR4 RAM just so he can use all ponies.

Ah. I need to get back into symphonic metal.

http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_llo7a7BR5e1qawvl0o1_500.png
I need to continue practicing the piano myself :S
cow334 I can play violin and piano by sound, but I never learned the actual names of the notes xD
nice RAWRity
dat moment, RAWRity xD
SparkleButt: it is
Good to know. I haven't listened to these guys since high school.
BroKnee: are you good at the piano
<3 Nightwish
Bye, everypony
BroKnee: well that os awesome I am learning how to play the note and the thing it self it's pretty hard but eh nobody gets anything on there first try am I rught

Tho i think Dark Passion play was their best album
xmasskills I wouldn't call my self good, but I can play some songs by Yuki Kajiura
So, Prince of Persia is on TV. Man, I didn't know ancient Persia had so many white people.
RAWRity: ikr?
05im just so worked upa bout tomorrows sc2
or that they all had british accents.
05gona be fantastic
cow334, I have perfect pitch. Doesn't mean I'm perfect with the piano, but you take what you can get :3
xmasskills I like violin way more, but I can't play violin anymore, my friend Erika won't let me use hers anymore and my parents wont buy me one
BroKnee: thats cool i always liked piano and violin music actually i like orchestral music in general but i cant play any of those instruments i do play the trumpet though
Polydunami: well I can still guess that you're better at it then me but i never give up so wish me luck
Hey, everyone.
hi DocSane
o hai DocSane
Quick question: What movies won the lotto this week?
been a while, RAWRity.
I'm still at beginner's level...
xmasskills Its not really that hard to do it, by sound anyway, learning the actual notes is a pai in the ass xD I tried for the violin and failed, horribly
hey WallDives
Hey WallDives :)
hi Polydunami.
Herro WallDives :3 <3
Ello WallDives
o hai WallDives
Egad, I'm hearing Phantom of the Opera
Oh god my middle school years.
This on repeat.
The whole time
Wrek: is this actually live or?
Teenage girls LOVE the friggin' Phantom.
Hardly live: she's not with the band anymore.
Ok im off for Today. see ya guys around.
BroKnee: well learning the notes was pretty simple on the trumpet but thats because it has like 3 places to press... but ive tried playing the paino.... didnt end well
TUOMAS
Isn't this in phantom of the opera?
05last of the wilds
(To be honest, I like the show also, but teenage girls REALLY love the Phantom.)
05is one of my favs
xmasskills I never tried to learn notes on the piano just because I failed so bad trying it on the violin xD
That IS Phantom of the Opera.
Wrek: is this live from the concert?
I used to write Phan Fiction. I'm not proud.
05Polydunami alreayd answered you Alicorn_Prince_Shane
SparkleButt: It's really called...Phan Fiction?
Yeah...
Wow...
Again, not proud.
Polydunami: did u say it was?
BroKnee: i think it would be easier to learn the piano notes than the violin
I'll say it again: that singer is not with the band anymore. Therefore, it's not live.
Still a better fandom than most of Sherlock Holmes, though
SparkleButt: I assume you were a 14 year old girl at the time? PLEASE say you were.
Polydunami: sad face
I was, yes.
08,01so i'm getting to go to a lecture by Noam Chomsky on Tueday
Acctually, thirteen for most of it.
Gnome Chomski?
11,01Yeah.
Chompski*
Why do I know that name?
SparkleButt: Ages 13-15 are the ages you are forgiven any bad taste.
05my aunt made sure i had good taste from the start DocSane :P
/me 11,01tastes
Wrek: good aunt. giving you quality music
Wrek: What did she introduce you to?
*yawn* Hay everypony.
08,01Alicorn_Prince_Shane: a linguist and philosopher
hi DuskShine.
Whoa, that was in the soprano vocal region :O
BTW, what are we watching? I'm a complete derp when it comes to music.
05must have been 4 or 5 whe nshe gave my a kassete with megadeth, metallica, some sonata artica and so on.
wow Polydunami this is rly old then
08,01he's famous for his liguistics work, as well as being an awesome anarchist
08,01http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky
05that was the first kassete
05many more were to come
11Yay
Question.
What are we watching?
Not to me, Alicorn_Prince_Shane.
08,01SaxyPretender: do ho ho
Hello Everypony :) Did I miss anything
/me apologizes, but he rarely gets the chance to use that joke.
o hia Cypresswolf
08,01SaxyPretender: if i was female, i'd let you know on wednesday.
Polydunami: didnt tarja leav like 05 or something? or b4
0,14XD
Wrek: wahts ur fav metallica album? mines Master of puppets and ride the lighttning

cow334: when you are not on light IRC there is a message
Hmm... can't say I've actively listened to Nightwish :S
11Rofl.
08,01oh poor wrek
Princess Celestia randomly broke out singing the theme song when I put RD on
Roses are red, asphalt is black, why is your chest, as flat as my back? >.>
LOL DAT KICK
oops allcaps
yes sagas
RAWRity: sounds about right
VioletGreySha: ohh kk
Whats this I hear about Ponibooru shutting down?
08,01sagas: by illness, indians, or otherwise
05gotta add the ghost commadn to my auto login
I be back
nuh uh
now RD has her gala dress on randomly
08,01Videofreak1127: kinky
lol
@Wrek: I'm looking at the front page and refreshed it. Most recent update I see is about the B movie being changed.
00,10did't even know you could do that wrek.
08,01who looks prettiest in their gala dress?
05Sumica: why do you think i get 24/7 online? :P
Flutters.
yes sagas
05computer starts? autologin
Twilight
05etc
08,01sagas: visiting temples, chatting to indians, whatever
tie between Twi and Rarity
08,01i'm sure i can find us *plenty* to do
Because she looks like space.
00,10no I ment the ghost on join
08,01i kinda want to travel around eating things
00,10and I never power down is how I have the 24/7
08,01but i also want to absorb the culture
and by temples, you mean "ruins in the middle of a bug infested jungle"?
I was never crazy about Fluttershy's or Pinkie's gowns.
05sudden... dress change
08,01i really liked Fluttershy's
DocSane: Shut your pie whole.
Twilight has the prettiest gala gown :3
08,01but my favourite was Rainbow Dash's
Hole*
08,01because it looked so... odd on her, i guess
08,01because you'd never expect her to wear a dress
08,01she was suddenly a lot more feminine, and it was kinda sexy
I dunno, I preferred Twilight's gown.
08,01sagas: ha! no, it means big, ornate buildings in the middle of cities
Lesson: Tomboy's can be hot
ah, that too i guess
That bookish student type reveals her beauty.
05otakon: tomboys were already hot
ikr wrek
08,01otakon: thing is, i think it was more like making a guy feminine for me
05implying?
I liek Twilight's bangs :3
11RD's gala dress is my fav as well.
08,01sort of like she was cross-dressing as a girl
Polydunami: Twilight is totally a Hollywood nerd, in that she's a very pretty girl who is pruposely kept plain-looking.
Wrek: nothing >.> <.<
Might i say: this is the greatest chat room. Ever.
DocSane, I know girls like that irl.
DuskShine: I concur
11,01Pinkie's is the worst.
11,01RD's is the best.
Nittany_Discord: IKR
05DuskShine: music and awesome discussions, ikr?
11,01And not because I'm an RD fan.
ikr wrek
Which ugly gala dress was worst xD.
Nittany_Discord: wait, dress wise?
Polydunai: I believe you, but Hollywood nerds are always fashion models with their hair tied back and wearing big, ugly glasses.
11,01Yeah otakon.
Ugh, I dunno if hilarious or sad
you mean hipster glasses, DocSane
brb
I think Pinkie's was the worst one.
I havbe the mane 6 on my screen
Pinkies was the worst failed one..

11,01Fluttershy would take #2.
Agreed.
I hated seeing flutters in that dress.
Actually, I liked Applejack's digs
Pinkie's dress was a totally overdone concept.
Well this nick is pretentious.
Applejack was kinda cool.
But I like it.
I'll keep this nick for a bit.
05oh look
05a cover
11,01Twilight's would look better w/o the saddle.
The thing is, Fluttershy could pull off wearing that dress. Pinkie just looked lijke a clown.
05high hopes - pink floyd. covered by nightwish
05this gotta be good
Nittany_Discord: its a pony thing
The saddle thing was a weird idea in season 1.
It's lucky they decided to keep the bridles off.
THAT looked kinky.
Oh my :S
norly DocSane
05wonder if this is a tribute to when pink floyd played the same stage 94
Gah
DocSane: they're PONIES
how hard can it be to internet
they're SENTIENT otakon
otakon: They're ponies in a world where nobody rides them.
Excuse me: SAPIENT.
DocSane: true
DocSane: Spike.
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 4Psyduck.
DocSane: Sentient is true too
There's a differrence between setience and sapience
05prefer sapient
it just goes to hsow it was once a WORLD OF HUMANS!
Twi keeps teleporting on my screen
and let the Lyra conspiracies begin
otakon: You and your head-canon.
Reikim: I don't have head canon, I go by the show
Oh, by the way, hi everyone. How are things going?
hiya Reikim still flaming, drunk and french apparently
05Reikim: jsut fine. epic music and sapience discussion goign down
05stop beign french otakon
PSYDUCK, get back in your Pokeball before I start bouncing YOU around!
Sapience discussion? I can dig that. What kind of sapience discussion?
Wrek: NON NON MONSIGNEUR!
05madmoiselle otakon
otakon: At least they let you drop the penis part. And you spelled "monsieur" wrong.
08,01sapience?
Reikim: I know :(
05i proably spelled that wrong too
08,01oh, i see
Wrek: Yeah, but you were closer than otakon :)
08,01had to read further up
08,01but yes, sapient beings are fair game.
So what's this discussion about sapience? I just got here, so I don't know.
05expand the genepool!
08,01so long as they're willing, and Tab A fits into Slot B
oh goddammit now my stream is slowing down
08,01sagas: starting off at Hyderabad

Dat hair.
08,01sagas: i mean, first place we're visitn would be Hyderabad
08,01maybe then to the north east
Dat rock.
Wrek: what band is this?
05RAWRity: age of consent is a relative factor
Excuse me. Gonna run down the street for an ice cream cone.
08,01RAWRity: well, yes, depending on their age of maturation, and whether they have such a concept
It's sixteen in Canada, RAWRity.
So...I guess we're discussing interspecies romance?
Polydunami: As it is in NC.
wat
/me gurren laglomps Reikim
08,01remember, i'm not discounting non-mammals
Reikim: I dont even know..
Reikim: wasabi my spirit brother?
08,01sagas: eeww, but sure
I lost track of the conversation..
08,01DuskShine: we're talking about sex with sapient beings
Tab A and Slot B and all that. And the manual that fails to properly explain how to do so.
brb
Sapient being homo-sapien right?
Bronysith: Apparently we're discussing sex with sapient beings.
Otherwise i think imma leave xD
!pokemon
omg boo ya! :D
08,01DuskShine: sapience means self-aware -- literally, "thinking"
08,01homosapiens means "the thinking man", essentially
So anything sapient is fair game?
So having sex with non-human species..
08,01like homoerectus means "the upright man"
Y'know.
05within the boudnries laid earlier
Wrek: Boundaries?
Reikim: Same diff
This is an odd discussion.
OH COME ON MIPS STOP LAGGING OUT
Oh so it's not just me
It's fine on my end
08,01sagas: depending on their level of sapience. that's a tricky one, because there are theories that neanderthals were more intelligent than us, but peaceful, so we killed them, then bred with them.
05ive been torturing mips for hours now xD
seriously, it was fine earlier
If anything sapient is fair game.
0,14I'm loving the vocals for this song
oh, that's wacky. I come back to Nightwish after listening to some Nightwish.
and then once again it starts THE BUFFER GAME
Then ponies are fair game technically.
08,01Reikim: well, yes
xD
and the PAUSING
08,01i mean, kille dmost of them, then interbred with the rest
Remember, ponies in real life would just be an alien species.
08,01that's why white people are stupid
DuskShine: wait...what about ponies is fair game?
Ah, the old Kill em, fuck em, and evolve me gambit
08,01they have less neanderthall in them
They are sapient..
Hooray for being half-Chinese.
otakon: He's looking for justification for banging a pony, I think. :)
See, that can go on FSTDT.
They know what is going on even if they arent on our level of thinking.
Reikim: you and ScootaChicken share that trait IIRC.
08,01otakon: well, true, but different races have varying genetics
Not that i would EVER sex with a pony.
That disturbing.
GET ME THE BRAIN BLEACH
05calm down DuskShine: no one is accusing you
Or are they?
The mane 6 keep making a conga line across my screen
Dun dun dun..
Just...before we get into the topic...a human-pony hybrid would probably be unviable. Unless Celestia does some magic to permit it, and oh god I'm stopping now.
DuskShine: dude, if you do or don't we don't give a damn.
05hops back and forth
05so fun
08,01sagas: "Comparison of Neanderthal genome with modern humans from Africa and Eurasia shows that 1â€“4% of modern non-African human genome might come from the Neanderthals."
08,01sagas: so i guess you're right
Im gonna leave till the conversation takes a less disturbing turn.
Cya.
05DuskStarshimmer|gone
DuskShine: Bye. You'll be waiting a while, though.
05lol
05funny thing is that duskshine was the one that took it there
DuskStarshimmer|gone: take care
05then he left for it being there
Wrek: Yeah, I was just thinking that.
Wrek: huh... odd.
Bye DuskStarshimmer|gone
Polydunami is skeptical.
Hypocrite.
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 7Mewtwo.
sure, why not
08,01i should learn more about paleoanthropology
http://www.speedtest.net/result/2014460681.png AND YET IT BUFFERS GODDAMMIT
So basically I chose to join at the best time possible.
God knows, there's a ton of scary fanfic out there exploring the concept.
DAMN YOU MIPS DAMN YOU
!pokemon
otakon: You don't seem to like mips very much...
otakon: Mips isn't gonna be nice to you if all you do is curse its name.
Deceptive_Cadence: the other way around...
RAWRity: it curses me goddammit!
Let's...let's not discuss the pony x human fanfic, please.
05so now we are discussing the different types of fanfictions? no thanks, i want to enjoy wishmaster
^
08,01# stephen segal #

ANYTHING BUT PONY X HUMAN
05sagas: bird x human
05alien x human
okay wait
otakon: You have to treat Mips with respect, lest it eat you.
Wrek: :D
08,01mermaid x human would be... tricky
05human x hummus
Wrek: talking mlp fanfiction
how come alien x human is usually okay in ANY OTHER GODDAMN FICTION?
Wrek: Isnt hummus food?? -lol
sagas: Fish genitals dont sound like fun
08,01Reikim: have *you* ever heard of a fishtop mermaid?
sagas: you pinged yourself
otakon: I know
05its easy she enters the bedroom, lays teh egs, then you go and wank off on them.
05best sex ever
The problem is discussing this just feeds into the terrible preconceptions people have about pony fans.
05...
but still, like Liara in Mass Effect
08,01Reikim: inb4 how you lost your virginity
05still better lvoe story than twilight
uhhhh.......
^
-lol
08,01Wrek: hahaha
08,01<3
BLUE CHICK FROM A MONOGENDERED RACE IS OKAY TO GET IT ON WITH.
Wrek: I concur.
http://derpy.me/52HAN
08,01otakon: monogendered race... my dream
!pokemon
So anyway, pretty sure I've seen this conversation before. been getting that a lot...
08,01RAWRity: eeewww
RAWRity: okay, I know that's based off of Rainbow Dash but it looks good.
DocSane: yeah, but they have no dual gender roles
RAWRity: Serve me up some of that XD -lol
RAWRity: Damn, that RD is pretty hot.
08,01or what?
DocSane: they are all female, the concept of a male is non existant
08,01how do they reproduce?
*mind
05so that in the future when the US finally says "ok we lied we has aliesn" that we can get it on
Wrek: :D
So... How are you doing Princess_Molestia?
08,01otakon: so.. basically like the Na'vi?
also, a summation of this entire convo: http://derpy.me/6eqNc
08,01otakon: what about bedbugs?
lets just say magic
08,01stabby stabby sex
0,14...dat riff
05extra pair of lips to play the flute
0,14that was iron maiden
05or the soupdrinker
05happy harry ftw
RAWRity: I dont find mlp to be dangerously furry
05(regarding na'vi
08,01otakon: oh, right
O.o
RAWRity: D:
Wrek: dat Harry Patridge
RAWRity: :D*
Bah.
How long has this consert been on?
05casue both are sapient
05MUAHAHA
08,01the Na'vi were so hot
05THE DRAAAMA I AM CAUSING
otakon: where did the 12 ft tall part come from?
chat derped on me
Ingwaz: comparison to the Na'vi
/me Thinks Wrek is proud of himself
You know sometimes when i come back from lurking and found a disscusion like this, the only thing i can do is keep lurking and laugh for a while.
08,01Iron_Edge: yum yum.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: having fun?
otakon: ah, never watched space pochahontas myself
!pokemon
08,0112 foot tall cat people
!pokemon
Ingwaz: lol
... I don't know what to say either xP
otakon actually yes, reading the chat is quite fun some times
08,01Kandarihu|BuddyBear: they're closer in biology to us, being mammals
Kandarihu|BuddyBear: Well, we could MAKE them humanoid. Magic, yknow. Friendship.
08,01humanoid ponies are just... kinda creepy
08,01it's the uncanny valley thing
I don't know if I have anything to contribute :P
05uncanny valley y u so uncanny
Kandarihu|BuddyBear: true, but ponies could be aliens that just LOOK like equines but are closer to humans due to sapience
08,01that, and i don't like seeing Twlight Sparkle with boobs
sagas play mass effect
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: someday
Funfact: To make the love story in Avatar believable, James Cameron went through several different redesigns of the Na'avi, each time going around asking people "Would you want to fuck this?".
wat
Oh
James pings me
Wow, this convo is so insane it crashed Flash.
RAWRity: taht makes me sad....
Ill prefer the inteligent humanoid to the unconsenting pony
RAWRity: so, he copied off of Mass Effect?
is the stream lagging or is it going just fune
RAWRity: -lol best idea ever
Hmm, adding BuddyBear to the end of my nick isn't enough.
sagas: what about a consenting pony?
:|
there we go

RAWRity: thats how you know your art is good. Would ya' screw it :D
otakon: Doesnt have the mental capacity to consent
REMEMBER THIS IS ALL IN FUN GODDAMMIT SO DON'T GET FRIGGIN BUTTHURT ABOUT IT.
sagas: good point
"Doesn't matter, had sex!"
... RAWRity, stop giving me fodder for my unmarked folder.
Here we go again with the MLH
you have to admit, twilight does look pretty good in that pic

She put a bag on my head!
RAWRity: now see THAT is what I'm talking about. Well drawn, I have no problems with it
05RAWRity: too much anime for my taste
Still Counts!
Ingwaz: /)
Ponies are less intelligent than children, making them unable to consent. Its like child rape
Wrek: As well /)
on other topics ponibooru is going to shutdown, so save your pics if you want them
05sagas: what?
DAMMIT RAWRity!
"I just had sex, and it felt so goooood!"
RAWRity: although WHY Ditzy has a bust that would make Anna Nicole Smith jealous is beyond me.
sagas: Again, waht?
08,01sagas: real ponies, yes
05but we arent talkign about real ponies
08,01but MLP ponies are sapient
05sagas got this all abckwards
"A woman let me put my penis inside of her!"

MLP ponies have a technological civilization.
08,01we're not talking about having sex with horses
doesnt surprise me
No we are NOT
08,01well, okay, we are talking about having sex with horses
08,01but sapient horses
clop ?
I'm back, everypony.
what is going on in here
wat
Man, the Ponibooru shutdown. Is there any way to get those torrents to work? Both Vuze AND uTorrent don't accept the torrent for different explanations!
CrimsonPhoenix: theoretical conversation
who says they arent otakon
You're a horrible person, RAWRity.
Ponies would not want to sleep with humans.
08,01otakon: or alternate dimension beings, or government experiments, or the next evolution of equines
Sapient horses? Its not my thing but if they are intelligent to comprehend and make their own decision, I have no problem with it
Reikim: http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/401650_276473945742469_223574434365754_798730_1325669214_n.jpg
Here's a thought: are the ponies really horses or something different entirely?
Randomnerd, there are exceptions xP
05sagas: thats the point
RAWRity: Thats kickass.
RAWRity: also, nice to see a artist that doesn't give Fluttershy a bust that puts Chelsea Charms to shame for once.
RAWRity: Epic
Although they would likely kill/crush you in the process
Wrek: immigrants are still human beings. Nationality doesn't affect species.
yes DocSane
Reikim: in the heart's warming eve ep, some of them were next to an 8ft candy cane, it proportioned out to like 3-4 ft tall i believe

lol
I just cant get into anime. Valley thingy
idc Jun
sagas: dude, but you like old Looney Tunes cartoons don't you?
Oh yeah
well, trying to get your definition for drf
Well, considering Celestia's the only adult in the room on that show.
Technically, most of the aliens in the Stargate -verse are human, besides the Gouald, Wraith, Replicators and anything the Destiny runs into.
For the most part, Ponies would view humans as hairless apes.
yes they would
There's some high school of the dead shout-out in Lollipop chainsaw
Now that's hilarious! Twice now this convo has crashed Flash!
CrimsonPhoenix: nice
Because we ARE hairless apes.

two actually
otakon: It has to do with the uncanny valey. Looney Toons is to the left of the valley
05Kandarihu: well yes. but then again most of them were decendants of slave humans
RAWRity: PLEASE LET THERE BE OCTAVIA
Asgard are humans, just cloned to the point of extreme genetic degradation.
RAWRity: giggity
otakon: so not disturbing
costumes at that
DocSane: Yes, Yes we are. the point is they'd think it's gross.
12!pokemon
Soital, you are a 14Axew.
i'm defining it as a alamagation of cute/sexy/clumsy. zat rite?
05the thor, jaffa and humasn are the dominant races in the stargate univesre iirc

05not counting ascended/ori

I feel the uncanny valey applies to sexual attraction too
RAWRity: She has the best...beats.
wait wouldnt you think that the mlp ponies would try to take over the world basically makeing humans into slaves?
08,01and the Nox
05nox yes

DocSane: define adult? cause if celestia is the only adult then what is granny smith? :D
08,01and the Tollans
also, for some reason my connection has slowed down obnoxiously
Right. I forgot about them.
13yeah it's normally used when referring to what's considered by someone to be a cute, perfect anime girl
08,01and the Furlings
08,01:P
cow334: why would they enslave us?
RAWRity: Alright.
13particularly younger ones
/me sings
Randomnerd: In a world where cows, mules, donkeys, griffins, and ponies live together, I'd question that conclusion
otakon: True, they're also bipedal. But ponies don't want to kiss Diamond dogs either.

Still I just cant get into anthro/humanized
DocSane: -lol What did luna do that was un mature? Name me one thing >:3
05one could argue that the reason for bipedal mammal being the "dominant" kidn of alien in shows are due to human actors.

Wrek: Being bipedal frees up 2 limbs, allowing for tool use
/me dusts nittany shrapnel
Iron_Edge: Demanding respect by landing unannounced during a town festival and scaring the bejeezus out of everyone?
Wrek: Pretty much. Star Trek did that because it was just easier to make, and more easy to identify

Okay. Sorry about that. That was a bad example after all.

I swear. If Stargate SG-1 or Atlantis were streamed on here, my mom would be HOOKED

The thing is, Ponies make friends with other species easier than we do.
Iron_Edge: lawl
Kandarihu|BuddyBear: THEN YOU HAVE A MISSION
05ill get my dvd boxsets then Kandarihu|BuddyBear
Wrek: It explains why intelegence favors bipedalism. Bipedal primates were able to use tools, giving them an evolutionary advantage
Wrek: Eh, not ENTIRELY how Evolution works, but close enough.
RAWRity: WHOA WHOA WHOA!
13sumica streamed sg1 once
13i have both
Not that far!
RAWRity: oh god nuuuu
hiya Shizuka
RAWRity Humans? WHAT IS THIS MADNESS?
We fucking kill each other over whether or not a piece of bread turns into flesh.
05sagas: i fail to see waht you are trying toa dd to the conversation
RAWRity: Oh my, seems I've lost my monacle.
*Tip hoofs into chat*
DocSane: They all knew who she was, she just wanted to make an appearence she did. But because of her bad past they shunned and feared her.
RAWRity: goddammit NOW I see why Spike really likes Rarity
Ponies would be pretty horrified by that.
/me glomps Ponies47
I wish you could've seen mom's reaction to when Sumica streamed Flight of the Navigator. She wasn't too happy about the timing of it. Because she just had to watch.
Wrek: explain why intelegence likely follows bipedalism and vice versa
12damn right you are
05one could aslo argue that sapient ponies would jsut stay the fuck away from us due to obvious reasons
00,10heh
Videofreak1127: Dawww you caught me :<

anyways HELLO EVERYPONY! :)
Iron_Edge: She was socially awkward to the point of autism.
Wrek: Well, yes, mute ponies get rode upon.
Honestly, I think the ponies would be a little freaked out by us at first but then they would warm up to us(assuming we don't try to kill them like the dumbasses we are)
hi Ponies47
Wrek: That we'd probably kill them, capture them, experiment on them, enslave them, and judging by this conversation, have sex with them?
Hey cow334 :)
Reikim: and thus the inhumantiy of humanity is proven again
Wrek: alright
Reikim: i think that is what earth would do to them
hiya Ponies47
sad right
Counter strike is good
cow334: yeah

Hey otakon :)
It's also possible that Ponies alter their environment and would alter us.
00,10You know you could stream it if you want Shizuka
no where as good as TF2
Reikim: We'd figure out how to get to Equestria, where cut gems are about 18 inches beneath the ground.
We'd probably study them non-invasively.
Reikim: And then proceed to strip mine it while reenacting the plot of Avatar.
05otakon: you can take the word humanity. its meaning. remove the human from it. and replace it with sometinh g more universal.
DocSane: more than likely the corporations would rape and pillage the land of all it's resources.
I know for sure if ponys came to earth we wouldnt be able to see them for a day till the goverment takes them all away and just dose experamints and its probaly trrue are world is a sad sad place
Dammit RAWRity, where are you finding all this?
Wrek: okay, how about decency?
DocSane: I wouldnt have used "autism" as the descriptive word. But socially awkwardness is totally different from people judging you before they know you and bolting at the sight of you -lol
Reikim: Brony FB group I'm in has a "Humanized Ponies" art folder.
otakon: I know right
WHO WOULD FIGHT TO SAVE THE PONIES?!
Seriously, they make the seasons change. They could probably turn us into a friendlier species.
I WOULD!
otakon: I WOULD
otakon: me
BUT THEN AGIAN
I mean, this is pure speculation.
05well the term, to be "humane" or whatever refers to being able to care and value others, right?
Randomnerd: yeah but they don't have TACTICAL NUKES
otakon: Eh, probably nobody. Besides, remember they have a freaking sun goddess on their side.
Iron_Edge: She was ordering them to make merry while stamping the ground so hard that it cracked.
DocSane: Ex. Everytime you come in the chat I say "OMG its DocSane" and leave. -lol
And, to cap things off, Cosplay: http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/s720x720/599941_10151095557615802_706155663_n.jpg
I DONT WANT THE GOVERMENT KILLING ME
lol
otakon: I don't think they needed them.
05but since "humans" fail this so often, removign human from it would be in order
RAWRity: ....Eh, nah.
RAWRity: that's actually really good
RAWRity: okay now that picture ahhh
!ping
!pong
Wrek: like I said, being decent
It's also possible they had horribly powerful weapons and swore off their use.
DocSane: -lol so she doesnt know her own strength. And basically what she said was "Go back to what you were doing" Just loudly and she phrased it differently -lol
Wrek: we would go crazy with them bascially if they came to earth
Randomnerd: makes sense
hello!
Isn't it ironic for humans to be so inhumane? :P
We're talking about a sapient race that fights with PIES.
kong
Hey CCCP]
Also, I'm back
hi CCCP
Polydunami: eeyup
wb CCCP and Polydunami
ding
Randomnerd: And we are talking about a cartoon
05Reikim: maybe not add a new word. if an eqivalent word already exists. if it doesnt then sure.
Randomnerd: *coughEndofS2cough&
hi Videofreak1127 cow334 otakon
brb guys, loving the convo but I need COFFEE
Reikim: Ironically, they don't use them.
05sapiancy. carign for others and their needs equally.
otakon: Coffee's probably good if you want to survive this.
05xD
careful, CCCP. Princess Molestia is here
Humanity, in it's purely natural state... can be pretty messed up. We are basically evil, after all. We need moral guid- EPIC MANEUVER!
Im gonna go with the Fallout Equestria version of ponies and theyre society
I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!
Wrek: Sapiency is the state of being sapient. Empathetic would probably be better.
12dong
Ahh, Nightwish huh?
I bet you any thing if there where mlp ponys on earth there are some sickos in the world and yeah you know where i am getting to
We are a selfish species
Reikim: in fact, that's more evidence they've sworn off more powerful weapons.
Moral Epic Maneuver. Good name for a rock band.
Iron_Edge: No, she didn't. She came in and said "Hey! Stop all this merrymaking and start celebrating as I demand that you do!"
Nightwish is quickly ascending to be a favorite band
That's who this is? Nightwish?
sagas: All species are selfish.
Rather, Epic Moral Maneuver.
ikr Randomnerd
!pokemon
DocSane: -lol well.........
Best name for a band ever: Mental Masturbation
It's just we're so good at causing widespread damage.
Randomnerd: At least the successful ones :D
Let me semi-copypasta what I meant to say.
05sagas: instinctually and biologically probably. but as Randomnerd said. it jsut varies.
RAWRity: ...No.
Randomnerd: yup
DocSane: Luna is awesome! >:3 *runs away*
All my thumbs, RAWRity xD
Reikim: yes
MAGNETS. HOW DO THEY WORK
pony_0022: carefully
Okay, how about this one that I translated from Pixiv? http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/133998066174.jpg
RAWRity: Sounds like the name of a cruddy little rock band made of teenagers that aren't aware of how badly they play.
VERY
Videofreak1127: be warned though, the singer in this concert isnt with the band anymore and the new one is kinda... meh
ok
RAWRity: IMMATURE teens. The worst kind.
Wrek: All behaviors, no matter how complex, stem from instinctual biology. Non-selfish actions are still instinct.
Humanity, in it's purely natural state... can be pretty messed up. We are basically evil, after all. We need moral guidance to actually be good people. It's amazing how much work has gone into stripping that out of society, to the point where anyone who tries to reinstill it is accused of bigotry and such.
Reikim: That's perfect, since I always meant for it to be the name of an Ultraviolence band.
ding dongs
05Dark_Horst: there is nothign wrong with the new singer, she is fantastic. but she nots an opera signer. which is why it is "meh" with nightwish's odler songs.
No seriously, how do they work?
are delicious
sagas: We evolved a hatred of murder.
KITTEN FIGHT

seems good kidzrul434
pony_0022: Each end of a magnet is polarized due to the poles of the earth
RAWRity: As long as you don't name it "Ultrafunk" or something like that.
kidzrul434: NO PONY FIGHT! *Throws Fluttershy* :P
sagas: It's obviously detrimental, so it ceased to be a desirable trait.
NO i'm allergic to cuteness!
Videofreak1127: ...No. No that's not how it works.
Chat derped and I had to refresh. Who pinged me and for what?
RAWRity: what happend to the pictures?
Wrek: sure, she's very talented. but compared to what they recorded with tarja she somwhat pales
Reikim: I'm not finished
/me catches Fluttershy and puts her away.
Aw... No reaction to Twilight's Visual Guide to Drunkeness?
[20:53:47] <Randomnerd> sagas: It's obviously detrimental, so it ceased to be a desirable trait.
well okay, everyone would probably pale there
05Dark_Horst: but cause logical reasons.
Videofreak1127: "Magnets are polarized due to the opposite poles of the Earth". No.
cow334: that's all for now. You'll have to go the ponychan for your clopping needs in the meantime.
sagas: <Randomnerd> sagas: We evolved a hatred of murder.
DocSane: Chat derped, we missed it.
DocSane, dat center panel :3
so are Twinkies
Reikim: Then how do they work?
sagas: There you go :)
RAWRity: nuuuuuu
http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/133998066174.jpg
The earth is essentially a magnet
05cow334: no clopping here
/me catches Pinkie Pie because she was falling
for those wanting cosplay pics http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/264/087/2f4.jpg
Wrek: I don't clop sorry about the playing around
05the earth is essentially a container containing a spinning ball of iron
All my wtfs
Randomnerd: We developed a hatred of murder because it threatens the development of a social group. Social groups are better for survival. Thus you have a tendency to not want murder
oh...
that works...
Polydunami: I think "Preachy" is my favorite, because I can see Twi doing that.
Ponies47: Thanks :)
well then...
Exuse me, any mares want to join me and Sith?
13all matter is made of cheese
Shizuka: agreed
Shizuka: Only on the moon
DocSane: that just strikes me as a drunken alignment chart.
Videofreak1127: Magnets may be induced by another field, but they are not usually induced by the Earth's field. The Earth's field itself is induced by the movement of magma beneath the crust.
Shizuka: THROW THE CHEEEEEEEEEESE
I'm a colt, sorry, Princess_Molestia
Honestly, I can see anypony act all kissy when drunk :S
The MOON is cheese
Shizuka: Oh but how I wish.
sagas: No prob. :P
Shizuka: So were basically rotten cheese?
05which is why there is a hich chance for conflic between species, because its essencialyl 2 rivaling social groups. unless both realise itsx better to be 1 social group
sagas: I'm probably wrong but for a different reason. Killing people often is considered to have some social utility.
Actually, make that ALMOST anypony
http://sonohara.donmai.us/data/951270c6369a2589a97f97579db9fc00.jpg
13conflict between species is caused by different flavors of cheese
05sorry for current and future typos, its gettign late.
Wrek: but then there are built-in behaviours that make us suspicious of other species. We immediately recognize them as competitors.
I like the way you think, @Shizuka
Randomnerd: Yes and as such we do permit some killing. Its called our sense of justice. Killing can be preferential for survival.
Shizuka: sounds about right
suddenly an indian
and I have returned
11,01Who wants a hug?
Oh god, Princess Tutu!?
13mozzerella is the switzerland of the cheese matter
Well, anypony wanna join in?
Shizuka: Where does the Gouda fit in? And the Havarti?
sagas: This.
Wrek: I think that is probaly wy diffrent deminsions are spreaded apart the galaxy like it was never meant to be to find a new speacious
05as i said, the weight of "mixing" must be higher than the weight of "theyre our rivals"
13swiss cheese on the other hand is sacred
Shizuka: which is why it is the best cheese
13because it's holey
Sure, Princess Molestia
/me raises hoof for nittany hug
Screw the Havarti!
Shizuka: it is a good cheese, and Colby Jack is the Australia of cheese
Killing in war is different from murder.
I guess...
Shizuka: BBBBBBBOOOO!!!!!!!!
0,14ba dum psh
/me 11,01hugs Iron_Edge
11,01You win.
Woot
/me plays a rimshot for Shizuka
Shizuka: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3KBuQHHKx0 cheese you say
/me hugs SaxyPretender
05cow334: i believe there is no reason for that, its just happened.
Randomnerd: It gets rid of those members of society who threaten the well being and survival of others
Kandarihu|BuddyBear: As I said, it has social utility.
05oh planets that hare habitable are so far away cause... someone wanted it to. i say WRONG.
/me hugs Nittany_Discord
oh wait is something on stream...
Randomnerd: strengthining the group and making it better at surviva;
Wrek: They're far away because the universe isn't fair.
/me hugs Shizuka
sooo... where'd they get that guy from? real indian?
Randomnerd: only if the principles of Just War are also applied.
05alot is

Kos
Hey there every- um wat are we watchin?
Kandarihu|BuddyBear: I'm not much for St. Augustine.
05war is essentialyl 2 groups fighting due to the dominace of the otehr social group in any aspect. be it religion, resource, etc etc
Pokes Nittany_Discord
you eat doorbells? Wtf is wrong w/ you? D:
Wrek: well yeah but wait I remember something nasa found a new planet that had the same structer as earth and it was 3 times bigger and it had a atmosphere to where we can live on it do you think there is life on that planet?
RAWRity: If you went into that expecting that then you were sadly mistaken and I laugh at your expense.
SaxyPretender! Y U NO HUG?
http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg393/scaled.php?server=393&filename=w5templateevaal5.jpg&res=landing
aAnd it also had water
RAWRity: we REALLY need to stream taht here you know
0,14becaucse pain
0,14so much pain
religous wars: nationwide fights over who'S got the better imaginary friend
RAWRity: To be fair, both happened. Just...one more than the other.
05cow334: does it have water? plantlife? then i can almost guarantee there is lfie on it. is the life sapient? probably not.
Wrek: Agree with all but the "two" part.
/me has the song Call Me MAybe stuck in his head! GET IT OUT!
/me hugs SaxyPretender to make it better
Dark_Horst: Lewis Black said it best
SaxyPretender isn't okay. (bustah wooolf.)
RAWRity: that's so true, it's sad.
War can definitely have more than two belligerents.
saga: Go watch Pony Polka. That oughta fix it.
05Randomnerd: 2 or more
Wrek :)
/me 11,01hugs Ponies47
05msot often 2 though
sagas: Listen to the mystical music to sooth your mind
those are Hostess snacks
Wrek: Its all comes down to probablity
Hugs Nittany_Discord back :)
Wrek: Yeah it has every thing water it's basically like another earth but 3 times bigger
war, Huh, what is it good for, absolutely nothing
Again, I ask: Who are these people I'm watching?
Obsidian: BUT I STILL HEAR IT IN MY HEAD! I WENT AS FAR TO LOOK UP AND WATCH THE MUSIC VIDEO!
*singing* War! What is it good for? It's good for you it's good foooor meeeee~!
Nightwish. Still.
And the belligerants tend to have total domination in that field.
Ryunosuke: Of course its useful ^-^ Who else is gonna burn all the moey we could be using for medical aid and debt?
sagas: Well its your own fault then
05another fun thought is: say we colonize anotehr planet. then let tiuem pass. i wonder how the humans on earth then evolve contra the ones on the colony after x nubmer of decades
Ryunosuke: money*
War! What is it good for? It strengthens the ecoooonoooomiiiiiiie~!
05hell might even be years not decades
Obsidian: That aside, the people in the music video are very attractive
13because then there's guaranteed to be dragons
Wrek: "Look into the canal. There are the Martians."
Wrek: Evolution takes a lot longer than that.
Wrek: Decades? not much. Takes longer
Ninja'd by Reikim
05Reikim: biological yes
Wrek: Think millions of years
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIKIM!!!
Wrek: it won't change that quickly unless someone has an agenda to push that society in that direction.
Randomnerd: Sorry, I left my ninja on.
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/074/648/whatIwatchedtemplate.jpg
Randomnerd vs. Reikim
Wrek: Look watch this video it tells you every thing and from there you can take a guess if there is life on it http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/planet-found-600-light-years-nasa-kepler-telescope/story?id=15094976
lol Simon
05point is adaptign to the planet. the number of years are irrelevant
aero
you are just predjudiced :<
05cow334: no video links durign streams
Wrek: After millions of years, potentially a seperate species
RAWRity: Couldnt agree with you more
That's...actually a pretty interesting question.
I should be able to eat doorbells whenever I want!
Wrek: Well, yes, we're nitpicking. Some interesting adaptations would take place, mostly psychological.
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/328/895/e85.jpg
Rarity as a human looks like a vampire.
Wrek: oh sorry about that i just got real interested over the planet
Wrek: Only if no others are able to visit and they only procreate amonst each other
im back everypony
Hi everypony
mish: Hiya
SpeedyBolt: Hiya
Oh, we added ponychat?
mish: Sup /)
Kos, doorbells did nothing to you
(|
SpeedyBolt: Sup /)
05then again. could one call say, tehcnological adaption and progress a kidn of evoltion?
So um...what is this? :p
RAWRity: Signs wasnt that bad
Nightwisk
(\
*Nightwish :S
Wrek: A similar process, yes.
Wrek: In a loose sense, sure.
Wrek: On a societal and evolutionary level. It's a little different from evolution in goal, though.
and me? Predijudiced? wtf, how does that even work?
This song: good intramentals...but where is the vocals' story and/or appeal....
Wrek: *societal and technological*
i belive
sagas: They seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
Evolution is an adaptation to ones situation
they are doorbells, not people
Randomnerd: Not always, but mostly yes.
It's not always a lovely upward process.
Think about that for a sec
05both are to advance and adapt yes? so maybe on a goal level. jsut different methods
Polydunami: Maybe they have different types of appendages/limbs?
that a evolution in tech/social/relgious style over time is evolution
Evolution is going in reverse as of this Generation :p
05maybe one day biological will be obsolete
Okay, enough! Ice cream! I'll be back!
Wrek: Evolution isn't always advancing. It has no direction.
Kandarihu|BuddyBear: I know and that is the part that sucks cause that means we will never be able to discovre it r see what is on it
05i dunno im jstu speculating withought much thought
sagas, that's dialogue from Signs.
mish: extinction of tribes and stuff
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/293/814/0cf.png
but if it happens at a fast and obvious rate caused by a sutation during a set period is called a Revolution
ah i see that now dark
Wrek: I think your thinking of a Deus Ex game type scenarion. In that case its very possible
RAWRity: Nice
Wrek: It's a common mistake that people make. Evolution has no "end goal" and is therefore not technically advancing. It's pretty much random.
RAWRity: so true
05msih: isnt that jstu a play on words?
indeed reikem
evolution is just a way of adapting to whatever situation calls for
Well, there's another way. But I'd have to go into heretic mode to suggest it.
05Reikim: yeah that makes sense
Hey everypony! Whatre we watching? :3
RAWRity, that picture works all the same if that middle panel was "What I expected"
RAWRity: /)
05sagas: that too
Chat derp back :P
Wrek: -_-
GUYS! I need to start excercising
Wrek, most likely it is. I dont even know, i haven't slept longer then a hour last night, and i was just defining the words
05where the different kidns of species development fold together
seriously, I'm 5'10" and 270lbs.
This concert is still going on
Not really getting into the discusion.....
otakon: me too!
05into a grey msuh instead

http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/296/812/b9d.jpg
Wait...we got from sex with ponies to here. This convo is glorious.
would be useful to speak this guy's language now
so, who has some good ways to excercise?
hi LL
Pushups
RAWRity: dont recognize the first 2
otakon: Kicking ass.
I thought that guy had a Grateful Dead logo on his shirt.
What U Need
And I was all wut
otakon: Playing video games
Princess_Molestia:
otakon: Do it!! It es fun stuff :) but youre lucky to be 5'10" :'(
Don't remember this one from Nightwish
SpeedyBolt: argh! goddammit I hate push ups
Well, there's the Kinect
lol
RaveBrony: not at 270lbs. or 19 stone
They're easy, and i'm a weakling :p
05mish: im still awake, you dont have an excuse :P
Hello everypony.
otakon: Alternatively, running, biking, or kicking ass while running.
they have no idea what he said. but hey, applauise
Reikim: I would assume that you were talking about carnal relations with other sentient species?
Reikim: I hate running
otakon: tall are you
otakon, I know a larp group thats good for exsirse... cause we acutall fight pretty hardcore o-o
A gloriouse 6' 1'' here
Running is good too

Running is awesome.

RaveBrony AWESOME HOR RAYY FOR BEING TALL
Suddenly silence
SpeedyBolt: not really no, but my heart is like 100 bpm at REST so I KNOW I'm not in good shape
Sorry, I don't judge by appearance.

Wrek: 160 lbs at 6 ft is skinny
Anyway, putting this out there, METRIC RULES IMPERIAL SUCKS
sagas: yes it is
My body is toned... but im short... so its meaningless :'(
I agree with Reikim
I wish I was that skinny
over the hills and far away? i know led zeppelin did that. This song is awesome too
we do when #bronystate is flooded
Hey, now we went from theoretical evolution to body sizes :S

RaveBrony: Its okay I look down to you

Vordox: What about me!?!?!? *Eye twitchs* Ok maybe sometimes I can be a little CRAZY! :P
Shizuka emptied a whole colony of humans,,,just cause.
RaveBrony: its normally alive during movies.....just not enougn non-lurkers to do anything
I may be fit...but what girl wants a short muscular guy?? :'(
OctoKiwi: Shizuka is rather...enthusiastic with her shotgun. Don't let her think you need to go to a better place. Ever.

OctoKiwi: (\
OH C'MON MIPS STOP LAGGIN
OctoKiwi: You are very welcome here. You will love it. /)
RaveBrony: I meet plenty of women at my height, you're just a tuch shorter, but you're in excellent shape :)
sagas: well I AM fat so it's MY club
sagas: Aw damn.. :\
OctoKiwi: Ah, that's a Bronyhoof they are doing, you usually return it with a /) or (\ Depending on how you do it. :)
OctoKiwi: welcome to the herd.
Sorry, that was boasting.
Randomnerd: But ALL the guys in my class are at LEAST 6'
/me noms on his club
Vordox: :<
OctoKiwi: Right now we're doing some late night music just to have something to listen and look to. :)
I luck out :'(
OctoKiwi: Yes I my self should tell please read the rules and make sure to follow them an don't break no matter what I had to learn the hard way but it's okay now
Point is, being short is not the the death of you.
For those of us looking for ways to exercise, I know this isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea but http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=6504
RaveBrony: but I beat you can punch them out
Anyone seen the Call Me Maybe music video???
Guess ill return during movies :P
Hey guys
This newbie welcome is going MUCH better than that fiasco last night...don't even want to think about it.
Hugs RaveBrony for the third time :)
I'm 6 foot exactly, and I know plenty of guys who are shorter than I am.
Hello RustyMeat.
I miss the first generation of kinder surprise
otakon: Haha, nah, i would be Horrible in a fight! :D
Nightwish?
Reikim: We told you not to talk about it. That poor newcomer..Didn't last 2 minutes until the herd attacked him...
At best i can take quite a few hits! :D
6ft is about middle of the road in the states
moo>?
Just sayin - 6 foot is average, which means half of guys are below it.
I'm 14 and my bro's 16. I'M 3 IN TALLER THAN HIM! :D
Vordox: Were you here for last night? Went terribly.
There's a reason I cheer for Tyrion Lannister.
Reikim: Nah I only heard rumours.
05fuck inches and yards and stuff
05it aitn logical
I'm about 5'7" and my oldest brother is at about the same height.
Wrek: Go go Metres
Lol!!
Vordox: It was the newbie's fault, really.
05ok so this concert is now over
Wrek: Kings in general aren't logical.
Hang on, I've got my ID
Now they look angry.
Yeah buck the imperial system
Wrek: (squee) logic! :P
05goan check if there's a queue
Reikim: You speaking of Thorn?
Wrek: I know but nothing we in the states can do about it now
05if i can continue ill play some more RoE for you guys
Sagas: Yes you can, LEARN
Wrek: Yeah... i wish the US would just convert already....
moop
Wrek: Hard to change when you grew up with it
RoE?
That was a cool concert. Thanks for streaming it.
170cm 68kg
05sagas: think of your children!
Vordox: The newbie had the name JailbaitTease. Wrek told her to change, and pretty politely too. She backsassed him over it, and Wrek had no choice but to reply in kind. Then she ragequit.
OctoKiwi: Are you using a Site for this irc, or a stand alone one? :)

Man I freakin love Nordic music
brb guys, gonna check if my new game came in.
Wrek: If they learned metric, they would be disadvantaged in the states since everything is not metric
sagas: States should convert to metric already.
Sagas: And there we have the problem.
otakon: Wht game?
otakon: what game?
drug dealers already have converted to metric.
/me wishes he was 5'10" like the rest of his family (excluding my brothers)

StupidSexyCJ: Im 5'6" :'(
05cow224: decide upon a name already

Dat plot
Ponies47: Why you so huggy today? lol
RaveBrony: know that feel, 5' 10" in a family where everyone is 6' at the very least
Vordox: Hes still here
OctoKiwi is still here.
Wrek hm fair enough though i know where that statement was being pointed it
Wrek: No well that is te problem I want to go back into cow334 but for some reason it says it is lock and I dunno what to do I didnt mean to break the rules or anything I'm sorry if i was
Vordox: Very very expensive
No, she's still around. She?
the
Wrek or well who it was being pointed it
Sagas: Hardly expensive.
StupidSexyCJ: Damn :\ at least you have an average height!
RaveBrony: Why you so sad? Dats why I hug you. Plus I like hugs. :)
Im just... short
sagas: Either JOIN the world, OR LEAVe the world.
That's the choice :P
Ponies47: Cuz im short D:
Vordox: very expensive. I would like to switch, but people here are to lazy to
cow224: It can do that sometimes, most of the time you have to close the whole browser and reload
Hwat is this?
sagas: And that's the reason alot of people around the world dislike USA.
And I'm back. Boy, I am lucky to live two blocks away from an ice cream shop.
dis Shizuka ever finish doom 3?
Wrek: Like i tryed to refresh but it say's name allready takein and now i don;'t no what to do i am sorry if i was breakingt he rules or somethind

Either follow the world's change, or become a non dependant state.
Doom 3, huh?
So much D3 on this stream. I like it.
05Shamroc: well someones gotta :3
Vordox: Not my fault, damnit!

oh hai dere Shizuka

Vordox: The coice is not mine
o hai Shizuka
Haha, last time I was on, someone said Repercussions of Evil in explanation of RoE. I laughed.
Sagas: But we learned alot of stuff, in one day I learned how to count Pasces, Kelvin, Inches and Feet, stone, Gallons.
RaveBrony: It's ok man. There are plenty of poeple just like you. Like my brother. He's 16 and I'm 14 and I'm 3 inches taller then him. Thats anthor reason why he doesn't love me! :'(
and dead
ONE DAY
:D
I was about to say Repercussion of Evil :S
Now imagine that ONE day = Whole USA would change, but will anyone do it...NO
WHAT?!
Ponies47: Oh damn >.<
LL are you familiar with Katamari LOVEMIN from the novita OST?
lol
RaveBrony: What?
Well, evil DOES have repurcussions.

Shamroc: look up Two Best Friends Escort Sevice, look CAREFULLY at the 5:51 time

Shamroc: I just closed it :(
prince-lemon speaks! (11th doctor is best)
RaveBrony: The mane reason he hates me is for being a brony. I don't let that bother me. I even asked him how can you judge MLP if you haven't watched it? He had no answer. :)
okay brb guys

Irish_Pony: He hates everyone
08,01StupidSexyCJ: i live in a fucking scottish village

I don't hate everyone, just Matt Smith. :>
RaveBrony: I have no pony stuff at all! I need to get some stuff. I'll start with shirts. Then stuff like blind bags and stuff. :P

Wooden stilted acting is not superior.
13don't know what you are talking about
/me slays the chuchu
Hi Everypony !
/me appears from the ground in front of DJMidgetBrony
/me leaps into DJMidgetBrony
Hello Alister.
intire
/me hugs alister
o hai Alister
no hugs plz
Ah yes. The infamous darkness of the game that forces players to choose between being able to see and being able to shoot.
hi Alister i love you
Hey Alister. You missed the discussion on interspecies sex and the mechanics of evolution.
Inability to hold a serious atmosphere, or make any attempt at humour other than the most basic of slapstick is not superior.
Reikim: Lucky me
Ponies47: Ah yes...my father...he didnt take it too well :D but hes accepted it since ive had a hot gf before :D so he knew i wasnt gay...lol
Plus he's fuck ugly, but that's just a bonus.
prince-lemon: who?
prince-lemon: He is not wooden stilted
Wrek: YOu had treatment back in the pad computer room
Only reason he accepted it
To each their own.
/me attcks Djmidgetbrony
/me pops some popcorn and sits back to watch the Whovian flame war
prince-lemon: He does get seriouse when it calls for it
I have no opinion on this matter, actually
08,01cow224: i have no idea what an HEB is
RaveBrony: I find it odd that people assume MLP fans are gay, since most of them seem to act like they want one of the Main 6 as a girlfriend.
08,01high energe barnacle
No, he attempts to, but can't because he can't act.
08,01there.
you know, asking who teh best dr is, is like asking who the best pony is, or best ice cream :)
/me sneaks up on Shizuka and gives her a hug
DocSane: Not this again
lol typo script
08,01he can act, but the scripts and direction he's given are terrible
RaveBrony: I has danced with a girl and she was CUUUUTE! I don't know if I should tell him or not. :s
A wooden plank with a smiley face drawn on would have a more dynamic and interesting range of acting than Matt Smith.
08,01to be fair
Ryunosuke: Only it's a lot easier, because nobody can beat David Tennant.
DocSane: Yeah....true... but then they just think were creepy :D
/me 11,01dusts princess-lemon
prince-lemon, you talkin bout Plank?
prince-lemon: well, here's somethin might make you happy: Smith is rumored to be leaving after Season 7
I think the gay perception comes from grown men watching shows that appear to be geared exclusively towards little girls.
prince-lemon: He maintains a childhood sense of wonder and curiousity
/me defeats DjMidgetBrony
Ponies47: About the girl? or bing a brony? :D
RaveBrony: It's no different from getting a crush on any other fictional girl.
Dat heart.
Well, I have to wake up early tomorrow. G'night everypony who's reading this.
night ZappyTheUnicorn
Kandarihu: Yeah, which means it has nothing to do with reality and everything to do with preconceptions.
/me leaps into DJMidgetBrony
Goodnight Zappy
prince-lemon: And it works for him. He has been very seriouse like when he goes all badass when chasing down Amy
Night ZappyTheUnicorn
DocSane: Meh, yeah thats true :P thats why i dont judge people that do that :D however, thats another reason why people call us furries =_(\
prince-lemon: after she and her baby have been taken
are those vortigaunts?
DocSane: indeed.
lol
Cya ZappyTheUnicorn!
DocSane: But then again the girl I love IRL is smart and talented. so It kinda says something considering my favorite pony is Twilight
BYe, ZappyTheUnicorn
they look like vortigaunts
RaveBrony: I told him about the girl! He was proud my bro is 16 and has never dated (What a loser) But I'm not sure if I should tell my dad about being a brony :s
See ya'll later!
Wrek: Better last stand then the welshmen in the movie Zulu :D
He might have attempted to, but he can't
The show when he's in it is just like a silly childish game.
RaveBrony: I've said this before: Pony fans like the characters in spite of their not being human. Furries like their characteras BECAUSE they're inhuman.
RaveBrony: Dated a girl
None of the episodes are serious, or in the least bit frightening.
I insist all thes times, dressing like Tim Tebow and going to a stadium is the same as dresssing as captain Kirk and going to a convention!
Randomnerd: That was a sentence full of win
Personally, I just love Tennant. Doomsday was one of the best of the entire new series.
Because he acts as though his target audience is about 5.
prince-lemon: I disagree. The entire arc of episodes in the resent series show him being very seriouse
Reikim: is everyone gay for tennant?
13rain rain~
Ponies47: Meh, thats up to you :P its not hurting him by not knowing. Its not like its drugs :D
<3
Reikim: or is it normal to be?
Thank you, Alister
Bronysith: Just about, yeah.
prince-lemon: isnt that the intended demographic though since its supposedly a kids show?
Matt Smith... is he playing the Doctor now?
It's not a kids show
Bronysith: Can't I just think a guy has a nice haircut without being gay ?
Kandarihu: /).=
For HOW LONG now, Kandarihu?
Kids might be part of the demographic
prince-lemon: when anyone goes after the people he is close to, he instantly switches personalities
GODDAMMIT YOU STUPID MIPS WORK RIGHT AND STOP PAUSING
prince-lemon: when was it ever?
Alister: I wish I had Tennant's hair. I also want his coat.
But it is in no way made for kids.
Alister: dude everyone is gay for tennant right prince-lemon and Reikim
I don't know. I wasn't saying he is. I'm asking.
/me slashes Chuchu
I must be like the only person in the entire world who really has no desire to watch Doctor Who.
/heresy
I'm asking IF he is.
FillyFlam: Your loss
FillyFlam: i dont either
It was origninaly for kids. Thesy changed their target audience
Bronysith: I'm not gay for anyone , well maybe except ....
DocSane: But unfortunetly people dont read up that much on furries OR the show :\
prince-lemon: To prove your point, we should stream Blink.
/me 11,01dusts Kandarihu
prince-lemon: I'm fourteen I cant work at a market
/me leaps into ChuChu
Thanks, Nittany_Discord
/me has defeated ChuChu
prince-lemon: is it normal to be gay for tennant? i believe so
FillyFlam: its... okay, but I do not hold my breath for it or any other show.. incluking MLP /heresay
I am a stegosorus
The early episodes were a little girl traveling with her two teachers and the Doctor.
99RB midi in the ... GT3 OST
The ONLY people I'd go gay for would be Garrus or otakon
Sarah Jane Adventures is for children
Even if you're a woman, Bronysith?
RaveBrony: A friend of mine would needle me when hhe found out I liked the show. He said it was okay "As long as you don't start buying the toys or painting your nails or anything."
Not Doctor Who

http://www.imgur.com/GBkmj.jpg
:P
Alister: but I don't like guys.....
Polydunami: everyone is hot for tennant
lolwut
They changed the content when they realized other peopsle were watching.
Alister: and Garrus is a spikey monster
I wanna be a pie!
And Matt Smith makes the show more like a CBBC prgoram, not a BBC show.
Alister: seriously he's SPIKEY
otakon: But he has such a badass voice
That's how Billie Piper wound up on the show.
I must be a nobody, then :O
otakon: I don't carer
RaveBrony: True. When I do pony shirts I'm gonna be wearing them alot. I got theme parks with my dad and there will be big crouds I want all them to know I is a brony and very proud. So he'll find out some time. :P
care*
To be fair, while Dr. Who was originally a kids show, the rebooted show has always been more focused on adults and teens.
DocSane: Omg, roflmao :D I didnt want to buy the toys... but meh, i couldnt resist the McD ones :D
Alister: S P I K E Y
hits Polydunami with a keyblade
Hardly
There's nothing gay about a man admiring the style of another man. Perfectly straight women do that all the time with other women.
RAWRity: Indeed.
otakon: It makes it even better
RAWRity: really? have you seen the older ones?
prince-lemon: Not hardly.
MIPS work right goddammit
I've watched 2 series of his shit
prince-lemon: They are very important moral questions
hai ther lemon
It's all poor
test
brb again
Then I got some of the McDonald's ones.
Ponies47: Yeah!! Hell, i walked up to the McD people and asked for pony toys in my Vinyl shirt!! :D Be proud!!
I WANNA BE A PIE!
Then I found the blind bag ones...
wait...
11,01You're welcome Kandarihu
It usually leads to a fashion craze.
otakon: I've seen the older ones. They were focused on kids. While they did eventually mature the content some for the viewers who had grown up with Dr. Who, Classic Who was pretty much always a kids show.
prince-lemon: Keep in mind, it might not be his fault. It might be what's his name, who's directing the series now.
DocSane: Haha :D I like the blind bag ones... theyre just simple figures :P not dolls
prince-lemon: I disagree. I find him to be very entertaining and interesting character
Ponies47: haha i had the same reaction to me when i went to six flags for a school thing i had my pinke pie toy hanging on the side of my backpack where every one could see it BUT THEN IT HAPPEND
prince-lemon: was that you that made ChuChu leap at itself? or is that a bug?
Then IMO you're an idiot. /end

I got a Twi, RD, and AJ for myself. I also got a complete set to put in a drawer until they get a bit more valuable.
Huh
...
DocSane: The blind bags?
cow224: Pardon me good sir/madam. Might I inquire who you are and why did you say you love me ? (oh fuck , I hope this I'm not confusing people or this is gonna be akward)
RaveBrony: No, the McDonald's ones.
prince-lemon: now your just making brash acusations
I'm gonna watch more pony episodes while you bronies watch whatever this is
the ChuChu bot just leaped at itself
Alister: Awkward ensues.
Oh right
prince-lemon: but I will end it here if you wish
Reikim: My whole life
RaveBrony: During a field trip this year to the amument park. I saw to guys wearing pony shirts I walked right up to them and we brohoof. My group looked at me like O_o
sagas: Brash accusations? On the internest?!
Because of the way I set the variables for when it loses
DocSane: Oh, cool! it was a PAIN to get the entire mane 6.... but i got em :)
I remember watching Classic Dr Who on PBS when I was a kid. I don't remember much about it, other than the fact that the Tardis was much brighter and much cleaner-looking on it's inside than it is in it's modern incarnation.
Randomnerd: Ikr?
I'll change it later
Alister: wait what I say that to every one cause i love every one
alrighty~
cow224: WHAR HAPPEND? :o
Starcrosser this is Prince-Lemon
*WHAT
cow224: *Sadface* ok
I think there was a robot dog of sorts... and I think it was called K-9
owner of the #bronystate channel if im right :3
RaveBrony: I got a full set, including Cheerilee and whatever the hell that other one was.
Alister: what is the matter
The morality in Dr. Who is very deep
cow224: Nothing , all has been cleared up
For Dari, Matt Smith is the Colin Baker of Nu Who
Ponies47: Bwahahaha, thats awesome :D at the mall today some dude passed me with a "Brony" shirt on, and i told him nice shirt and he was all like "Hell Yeah!!"
okay then Alister i love you
halo evry pony
I'll be back
o hai geeky-brony
RAWRity: Man, I hated Colin Baker.
cow224: It won't work now :|
halo StupidSexyCJ
DocSane: Ah, I was sadly short on money, so i didnt want to buy Cheerilee or.. the other one :D
Alister: wait what do you mean?
/me hugs geeky-brony
I was brought up on Tom Baker, so I'm one of those people that are impossible to satisfy I guess.
oi Xanbreon
Hey geeky-brony!
cow224: Nothing. I have to think
I ended up getting a Pinkie for a friend of mine who finally decided he liked the show.
I can't wait to watch Matt Smith die next series
Alister: k take your time
Can't wait.
/me hugs sagas
I wish - quite vehemently - that I had one of those custom Twilight plushies. The last time I went to a convention to get a plushie, they were all sold out in an hour.
halo RaveBrony
I want the MLP belt with everypony (Mane 6 and spike) on it so bad!!! :[
05OH FUCK NOT THIS PART HELP ME SHIZUKA
RaveBrony: I didn't care bronies are bronies. We love and tolerate each other. But yeah when ever I see bronies I don't care who I'm with. I'm gonna brohoof em :P
Fresh Prince of Bell-Airr FTW!
I realized that he was identifying with Pinkie, so I got her for him.
05NOT A FUCKIGN BRUISER
oh not him ! hide ! before he hugs you !
prince-lemon: already saw him die a couple of time. Bad things came of it though
prince-lemon: Out of curiosity, how do you think they'll handle the "only 13 regnerations" thing?
Ponies47: Now THAt is being proud to be a brony! :)
Reikim: By ignoring the HELL out of it.
They've just decided to scrap it
Apparently
Wrek: Just keep clam, stay focused, and keep running.....
Ponies47: I was in the line to get some food and then like seven dudes like about 22 came up too me and you are never going to belive this
halo Ponies47
Well that's disappointing.
No shock there.
/me appears from the ground in front of StarCrosser
prince-lemon: also already watch Tennor die
/me leaps into StarCrosser
RaveBrony: Teh he. :)
prince-lemon: over and over
Hey geeky-brony :)
/me slashes Chuchu
/me is knocked back
Ponies47: (\
/me leaps into StarCrosser
cow224: WHAT WHAT!?!?!? :o
/me kicks Chuchu
I remember when I streamed Tennant's last episode
RaveBrony: /)
(does it understand that one?)
/me slashes ChuChu
LOL the 20% 2 hit knockout occured
/me dissolves
Woot :3
wow
Virtually everyone watching was shouting at me to shut it off and soon as he regenerated into Matt Smith
cow224: what happened next ?
Because it was so obvious just how bad he was in comparison
yes?
i guess that means star is terrible with a sword > w>
they sell Ghibli related stuff too>
*?
Of course, They could get the best British actor in history to play the 12th Doctor, and it wouldn't matter. Old school Who fans would still say he's nothing compared to Tom Baker
prince-lemon: I miss Tennant...he was the greatest.
cow224: TELL ME TELL ME! :)
whats up Ponies47
prince-lemon: Smith will die, yes, but I have confidence the next doctor will live up to the standard
I need to watch more of Doctor Who... Ive only seen like...2 episodes
O_o
No one could even stand 10 seconds of Smith
the chuchu bot has an 80% chance 1HKO
no D: It means I'm lucky.
prince-lemon: I was fine with it.
prince-lemon: when you get the chance do you think you could stream Fresh Prince of Bell-Air? :)
prince-lemon: Yes they could
Well, the only way onward from Matt Smith is up
why lucky? :3
geeky-brony: Nothing much. Talking about run ins to other bronies and other brony stuff. :P
sagas: You weren't there when I streamed it
prince-lemon: Please don't tempt fate like that.
Ponies47: awesome
Everyone was telling me to cut off his 30 seconds of screen time
Ponies47: they went into there back packs 6 of then took out mlp toys and the last dude had a jacket on and he took it off and it said every day im derping it and he look at me and said (brohoof fellow brony) i was aww strucked it was awesome
Ah, a sitcom from back when I used to watch sitcoms.
prince-lemon: I know I wasnt there
ohhhh doom
Xanbreon, which server did you put Skylands' BNC on?
Because it didn't accept properly?
Oh
cow224: :O:O:O:O:O:O:O
prince-lemon: Now that you've said that, the 12th doctor is going to suck.
Bugger
THAT'S FUCKING AWESOME
I stand by what I said. :P
prince-lemon: people like Matt Smith. Plenty of people still watch and enjoy the show
What did you put it on?
wahts up BroKnee
Only way onward is up
Because I need to trace it back
pony_0022: yes
I shoved it on sol2
cow224: THAT IS AWESOME! I wish that would happen to me :d
05fuu
I forgot, have been very busy
sorry
x_X
lol
ded D:
So ValtheJan:G3.6 Scootaloo|prince-lemon:Matt Smith?
I already have my issues with the upcomign Dr. Who seasons. First off, the new companion they've cast keeps giving me flashbacks to Peri from the 5th/6th Doctor's run.
You can't put it on the same server...
prince-lemon: No, Matt Smith isnt that bad and you know it. Your exagerating a bit
Yes
Ponies47: I know it was freaking amazing i was like what is up bronys
God was Peri shit.
http://www.imgur.com/SO0dr.jpg
hi. what we doing now?
^at that shop
Sorry, but that's how I feel
As I said, very busy, someone poked me todo something in the middle of 5 other things
Because I got a rare occurance
I <censored> up, sorry
Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 106 time(s).
but its the same place that used Articuno's artwork
so I wanted to see it :P
prince-lemon: quick, Best Classic Doctor
God Damn this game and its love of darkness. Whoever decided "Darkness will make this game fun and hardcore" and decided to switch the lights on and off? He decides to be dragged out into the street and shot.
prince-lemon: Well I will respect you opinion even though mine is different
/me picks up mish and gives her a hug
prince-lemon, what happened to your white on yellow chat text?
Tom Baker
<#
Okay, everyone, fun as this may be, I have some work to do. Later!
nah, no problems Xanbreon
check next time though
playin deadspace?
later DocSane
Reikim: There are games where Shadow is good
Night DocSane
Hahah mish, people complained that their eyes were bleeding
*guessing*
mish: doom
later DocSane
prince-lemon: psh. Patrick Troughton>>>>>>>>>>>>
Reikim: Welcome to modern horror shooters
I haven't watched much old Who, RAWRity.
MahBoi777: whats up man
yah. so where mine prince-lemon. but it was your signature text, and will always be.....
Reikim: Like in the Thief series. You can always hide in the darkness
For some reason brainfart on the whole not two people with the same username on the same server thing at that moment
ohai geeky-brony! nuthin much, u?
er Xanbreon, did you increase count in netlist?
MahBoi777: same here
cus' i'll get Naero to decrease it if you did
Alister: I'll give you that, but only so long as it doesn't impede your visibility.
Doctor who, a long show that survived by only airing an episode when it was granteed ready, regardless of how long
I wish they'd release a thief series compilation
I watched a lot of classic Dr Who, but a lot of my memories of that have been rewritten by video games and anime.
/me wants bleeding eyes, plz
I think we can all agree though, that Paul McGann had the worst tenure as the doctor, if only because he only got the 1 go.
prince-lemon: that is just a personal taste, not unlike as I said before, Ponies and Ice cream, I know some people that absolutely HATE Pinkie Pie (yea, I had the same face reaction too)
seriously, the wait between each episode is about 2 weeks to 3 mounths
cow224: You know that time at the amusment park. We was eating lunch. I said to my group 'Hold on a sec' I got up and I walked up to them and said BRONIES! BROHOOF! We brohoofed I turned back at me group and they where looking at me like O_o When I walked back to our table they said 'What was that all about?' I said ah nothing. :P
mish: how are you i havent seen you on i a long time
Reikim: It does not impede a lot. But it sure does the tick for the guards
RAWRity: never watched him
Man we're very busy tonight...
*in
BOOOBS
/me geeky-brony recives the one thosand hugs of welcoming
sagas: not surprising, as he was only in 1 movie as the 8th doctor.
ASS
and then GONE
.....dead space?
RAWRity: must have been pretty horrible
pretty much
Alister: See, that's smart. But when you decide to make the player incapable of seeing, in an FPS? That's a decision that deserves a slap on the back of the head.
Ponies47: that is epic
mish: :)
why the hell havent the monsters killed her yet?
this dead space has the qauility of the Wii version.....
and i know the wii verison.....
sagas: it was a sci-fi movie being produced by Fox. in the 90's.
Irish_Pony: shee important to story
Reikim: I agree
The way that scientist moves is unnerving.
more importantly, why are her boobs sticking out like that?
RAWRity: I figured as much
Ryunosuke: Because sex
geeky-brony: ya but cant those things teleport?
Ryunosuke: Space...gravity...?
-_-
I did
And I'm back
wb Polydunami
o hai Polydunami
This is deadspace but it doesnt have the same appearance, its confusing me.....
mish: It pretty much is the same thing
mish, Doom 3?
Irish_Pony: idk maby she has a anti telport shild and it works on demons from hell
.....thats what i thought
what a shitty shotgun
k
Doom 3 , Dead Space. I don't see the difference
Yeah, I've said it before: as far as video games go, I'm not one to judge by appearances.
Alister: Dead Space i feel was scarier
its just the artifact, the appearance of your meters is suprised me
In fact, I'm skeptical if a game has GOOD graphics.
sagas: man thats the best shot gun it the beda shot it kills beter then the pump
guys i got a question?
Polydunami: spoken like a Wii player
Oh yes, appearnce is not about whats pretty...
And I have just committed a foot in mouth
geeky-brony: that it true
sagas: Jump scare are scary ? Play a real horror game. Go downlaod a clock tower mod kidddo
sagas: rom*
my virus scanner said this website is a threat
Polydunami: good graphics dont make good game
FillyFlam: oh shit
Alister: I know but its more than what doom 3 has
sagas: yup
thats not good
sagas: Still , it's pretyy mediocre
imma just ignore the virus scanner
it must be faulty
the point of a games appearnce is to convay the arua of the game and the game's story, like all the shooter games use realistic graphics, and games like Okami(<3) use styleized(aka shell shading and painting) instead
Yeah, I would not go near a game unless I knew I'd be in for a ride.
Alister: Its scary for a short while, but quickly looses it. Doom 3 was never scary
Wrek: Be like Shizuka and put them to death with your fists.
is that the alien from alien
Reikim, with God mode?
sagas: I was sacred from Doom 1 .... when I was 5 yr old
I play minecraft because of the building, not because of the graphics...i mean god, what graphics .-.
Nittany_Discord you there?
I think he blew up....
mish: I play minecraft to make giant phallic objects out of stone. And ponies.
/me throws dust at Nittany_Discord
I actually prefer graphics like those in Minecraft.
mish: lolz
11,01Yes?
Reikim, theres other ways to play minecraft?
mish: What you described are Aesthetics , not graphics
11,01And now I have dust on me.

Oh god. Some guy I know is trying to come up with people to cast for a Mass Effect movie. So far: Tracy Morgan as Jacob. Shia Lebouf as Kaidan. Kim Kardashian as EDI.
Sorry, i get confused easily .-.
/me vacuums Nittany_Discord
/me dusts Nittany_Discord
RAWRity: That last one has me cringing.
Nittany_Discord: you should stream the Alien vs Predator game as the alien. In honor of our recent trilogy
11,01I don't have that game.
mish: how are you
11,01I said that before.

RAWRity: Meanwhile as the Elcor diplomat
mish: awesome

Nittany_Discord: okay then go back into your deep slumber
geeky-brony: wanna play a game...cuz im bored....

RAWRity: ...He's joking. For the love of God say he's joking.

RAWRity: awesome

i once lost my eyebrows from a fire
I'll be able to donate again this Thursday if it's still going on :)

BroKnee: Tom is streaming the buffer show, season 2
TherareP0N3: Black and white of course
Nittany_Discord: Well that sucks. There goes my plans for getting the game.
imagine the whole world being bronys maybe there wouldn't be wars and crap like that
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYy
05Reikim: you can blame EA for that
11,01It's Origin-exclusive.
11,01Enjoy.
MahBoi777: for what show?
lakingsfans: thats wishful thinking
Oh, is it on Origin? Fuck that, then.
MahBoi777 Still the 2nd best show EVARH >:3
I want a release date. I'm still anxious about it.
Reikim: have faith. Crysis 2 came to steam after being taken off
lakingsfans: there would still be plenty of wars
TherareP0N3 torchlight, l4d2, amnesia those are good choices
face
BroKnee: IKR
Nittany_Discord: still waiting on those pics
on what?
Hiya everypony
Just wars over far more petty things.
Hiiyo Bronystate
who is the best pony?
05its ratehr funny. they pull it off steam to attract users to tehir own DRM platform
lakingsfans: RD
lakingsfans: Pinkie
05but then they notice shit sales and gotta release to steam anyways
hey SunderlandPony89! how are you?:)
hey SunderlandPony89 Shimmer
lakingsfans: Don't satrt that fight, but it's rarity
/me Twilight Sparkle, lakingsfans
Wrek: wat?
halo Shimmer i havent seen u in a long time
Fuck Origin.
MahBoi777: Just fine, how 'bout you?
icybeauti: too late
Seriously, why does EA even try?
hia SunderlandPony89
NO NO NO i mean wars against who is the best pony
Yeah...Lets watch the splosion...
11,01Not to be mean, but why not just give us a needed donation TherareP0N3?
lakingsfans: id say fluttershy
SunderlandPony89: doin gooooooood
"And lo, the anti-clop war did rage on for many, many years. Many a brony lost the love in their eyes, and it was many years before the children of tolerance could speak openly."
/me taps foot, waiting on Nittany_Discord :|
lakingsfans: no war
would that be possible if everyone in the worl were bronys
MahBoi777: That's gooooooooood
05best pony is a personal matter, deal with it.
Nittany_Discord: Nah.
:P
00,10the funny thing is how much they had to cut the price of it already cause no one wants it as much cause it's not on steam.
It
Wrek is correct.
geeky-brony: I'm on the chat at least once a day, right now it's 5 in the morning here though :)
Then I guess Twilight Sparkle is a personal matter
It's Rarity, then fluttershy, the dr.whoove, then derpy, then rainbowdash.
11,01Sumica: And the ending probably hurt their sales as well.
:1
05icybeauti: for you yes.
So when will wii have vid
Reikim: What game is everyone talking about?
Alister: ...Giggity.
11,01sagas: Be patient.
One does not simply choose a best pony
SunderlandPony89: ME3
k
:3
Wrek is best pony/man hybrid
Wrek I guess it's clear who your fave pony is :)
RAWRity: are you quoting on the war on 4chan a few years ago
Reikim: Oh you !

geeky-brony: eeeeeeyup, I do
It's 19:50 right now.
Wrek: what you think of them?
I know spanish
Sumica: Free DLC =)
05dey be neat
superretroworld: if I recall correctly, to be nominated it has to be during the calendar year. Smile and This Day Aira came out after Jan 1, no?
MahBoi777: lolz 3 or new vegus
my stream froze
Polydunami: wow, it's late :P
Bronystate is now bronymusic?
geeky-brony: both
That's ten to eight here

Bronysith: The best part about them is ofc that the vocalist is norwegian :)
Moo?

Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: More than MLP?
No fucks were given that dat
day*
i dont get it, we have a huge community, all the episodes are fantastic, the animations great, why did we lose????
Sorry Shizuka, I can't seem to connect :(
look at this way, which franchise is making more money, Madagascar, or MLP :)
Reikim: me ethier i dont no wy
Hey, is BroNYCon gonna be streamed here as well?
We lost ! Get over it !
13reason?
because they thing were god damn weird
superretroworld: who knows
13we have 24 bots playing the targets so
frekin judgers
They did have some funny episodes. There was one where they found an egg and watched over it, and it was lol worthy...Or was it because I was in like 6th grade when the show started?
Shizuka: when i try to join it say server not responding
Shizuka: Actually, I can't connect period. No response from the server.
Nitt: Fair, though I'd point out that the Madagascar franchise's animation isn't exactly spectacular quality and I can probably come up with a few shows I'd rather see in that spot.
11,01Shizuka: Is this a TF2 mod?
geeky-brony: well im guessing its because there judging it as a girls show
But the movie was good....
Okay, fine. Here I am :$ http://postimage.org/image/9tj6n31al/
05superretroworld: its easy. manipulation of the winner. "we cant elt MLP and bronies win cause they are abominatiOn"
I'm embarrassed :S
superretroworld: prob
Wrek.....It stinks that's the reason....
So, I take it steamers are being changed?
Wrek: Oh, how they annoy me.
Wrek: your pic for B.U.C.K was friggin awesome
give it time
11,01Penguins is not a bad show. I enjoy it though I though I haven't watched it in a while, but it's because I just don't watch much TV anymore.
Polydunami: And you should be ! Nah I'm kidding you. you look ok
I'm reminded of The Emperor's New School, you know, the cartoon wasn't the least bit funny
Polydunami: don be embarrassed
0,14Polydunami looks like a cool bro
05'tis a concpiiracy i tells you!
Hang on, I'l be back
If we are an abomination then what is girls doing "boy" stuff? That has been going on for decades
old disney cartoons were beast!
^
but then you have to actually wonder, WHY is there so many bronies/fans of mlp
now the shows are crappy
08,01remember, you can't have conspiracy without piracy
So yeah Shizuka, we can't connect. Sorry :'(
Nods at lakingsfans and icybeauti
Shimmer: You must be new here. Let me introduce you to Misandry
where can I see this
YOU are a pirate!
about penguins beating MLP?
Shizuka: I don't no what the prob;em is ?
ponies are better than penguins
by far
dem people don't know how to join a server
SunderlandPony89: ik, andc the movie was great
lakingsfans: dont start a flame war
YAAR HARR DIBBITY DEE BEING A PIRATE IS ALRIGHT TO BE DO WHAT YOU CAUSE CAUSE A PIRTATE IS FREE YOU ARE A PIRTATE!...lol limewitre...
the awards don't really matter in the grand scheme of things. Would it be somewhat nice for some of the creative folks behind the show to be recognized? Sure. But it doesn't change a damn thing in the grand scheme of things.
No stream right now? I don't have a stream.
icybeauti: Lol
There are a lot of awards that go to shows/movies that don't deserve it.
Remember when direct-to-video Disney movie sequels were good?
lolololololzzz
Ponies47: buffer show is on
All awards shows are notoriously rigged.
hen3ry: That depends on your point of view.
reikim:liiike....?
Eddmario: You mean never ?
Hold on
we could be nominated for golden globes
MahBoi777: YAY! *Gets the worlds biggest bucket of popcorn*
My early childhood was when disney was still okay...But when I got to elementary school, it went to crap.
I'm bacl
amen
*back
wb Polydunami!
When I'm buffer sauce.mp4
superretroworld: The Emperor's New Grove was the funniest animated movie I've ever seen, which caused confusion when the show came out and I realized how unfunny it was. Where'd all that talent the writers had go?
hey Ponies47
Ponies47: how r u
To someone who enjoys the show already, yes, an award means nothing since you already enjoy it. To someone who has no plans to ever watch it, again, no change. But to virtually everyone else, it does.
MahBoi777: :( I want popcorn
0,14one of the biggest award snubs that pissed me off was the Curious Case of Benjamin Button winning Best Makeup or something similar over HELLBOY II
Man, I've already seen this episode of the Buffer Show. It's Season 2, episode 891.
Ohai superretroworld :)
geeky-brony: fine :)
Saxy: lolwut
when did disney go from a family cartoon franchise to a franchise only for tweens?
Ponies47: good

I'm just going to play pony fortress
YAY
seriously it's god damn aweful

I should go to bed. It's 11pm and I have my final tomorrow...But it's fun here.....
MahBoi777: I could share. :P

lakingsfans: The kids they made their original cash off of have all grown up.
Ponies47: THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU?? TT_TT lol jk
icybeauti: SLEEP IS FOR THE WEEK, remember :P
There was one really retarded snub, a few years back.
hen3ry But this is the unrated, uncensored director's cut that almost got banned in 27 states because of a VERY detailed sex scene between 2 horses
icybeauti: Weak* 6_9

I think it was in animation?

if only walt were here
SunderlandPony89: All week
Ponies47: lololololololololol
Eddmario: Whatcha talkin bout?
HEY I GOT A QUESTION EVERYPONY!
things might have been different
Ponies47: Ask ahead
icybeauti You didn't know that about this episode?
It's sort of inevitable that they'd have to consider stepping into the older demographics eventually, since nostalgia won't keep them afloat forever, and their tendency to run franchises long after their welcome stage doesn't help either.
Nittany_Discord: Post it anyways. We're curious.
less canterlock, more question, Ponies47.
Eddmario: What are you even talking about?
icybeauti This episode of "The Buffer Show" that we're watching
If anypony here plays TF2 on a laptop. Does it work ok?
Yes Ponies47
Eddmario: The buffer show? never heard of it.
i tryed it it doesn't work
Depends on your laptop Ponies47
CriticKitten: what's this we're talking about?

wow, like, all the pictures of me suck
Still probably can't draw with a lick
CrimsonPhoenix: Why not?
Scoot-Scootaloo: hmmm would you like to take that up for A CHALLENGE
SolairePony89, rare are people that actually look decent with a fedora
flutter_spin then use a pencil! Your tounge is for tasting, not drawing
i like to keep my face a secret
CrimsonPhoenix: Well, I could pull it off. Maybe
Eh. I have done pencil work in the past...
CrimsonPhoenix do I look decent with a fedora?
i don't know if any one of you could be part of the CIA
Dunno never saw you with one

But I wanted to play around with some background pics online
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: nnnnnnnope
Scoot-Scootaloo: Hory sheet, Dead Island does have some sad music
My goal was to edit pics, not create them. I'll draw later.
