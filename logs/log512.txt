Bromance

08,01sagas: i'm planning on being there at least a month
08,01maybe more
08,01sagas: probably Mumbai, then train to Hyderabad
Saturn: 3. Where do we plan to stay? Hotel? Relative?
08,01either that or Chennai
Saturn: Heh, I'm not sure I can do a month mate. :$
now she is sweeping
08,01sagas: i could probably swing us a few weeks with one of my relatives, but i'm planning on travelling around a bit and staying in hotels
08,01GilDash: you don't need to be there the whole time i am
08,01BronyState goes to India
08,01:D
/me 11,01dusts Saturn
seems legit, Saturn
sharing
If I had money, I would come >.>

yellow
If I had money, I would be commissioning stuffs from artists
Saturn: I already have a passport
08,01sagas: probably june/july
08,01we're talking above 40C
08,01yes
Saturn: I presume you mean next year now, as it's june/almost july this year.
hotter than texas in a heat wave, and muggier than detroit on a wednesday evening :)
08,01water needs to be sterilised and filtered
Saturn india as in india india?
08,01killerpony7733: i don't know of any other india
:P
08,01GilDash: aye
just dont drink it :)
Saturn: That's cool. It'll give me some time to prepare a bit.
Also, hey everypony :3
yeah, I know saturn
Saturn: I blame the telemarketers adn Customer Service reps :)
08,01cowvarkian: because people refill empty bottles from the taps
yeah, I know, saturn
Saturn hmm you know if its near next year in the summer i could go possibly since i'm quite the money saver :D

08,01Dark_Horst: aye, exactly

Saturn is it going to be like next year or something like that?
VAMPIRES!
Planning for next year, huh?
08,01cowvarkian: as a 15 year old, i'm not even sure you could get a visa
I prefer ramstein, this is kinda ... flashy
0,14Nightwish?
0,14UYES
0,14YES
yeah, I know saturn
0,14DARK CHEST OF WONDERS
/me 08,01doesn't need a visa because he has a Person of Indian Origin card
who's on now?
seems legit saturn
damn it. now i cant go -.-
Nightwish has some decent music, but the show seems.. flashy as I said :)
08,01except i can't be in parliament
Saturn: He could, but would need parantal permission to travel abrad with strangers
seems xenophobic saturn
oh... nightwish
to bad she left. i hear she sings opera now?
can't say I've hgard of them
I only know of Nightwish because I watch Raocow
Saturn: If I can get the funds, I shall join you
also
05left and left, they absically kicked her out for beign a diva
*basically
i thought it was soemthing like that
05godlike voice though
no dpubt
Right, I'm going now. G'night. :)
0,14the instrumentation for this always reminds me of something you hear in an epic boss fight
man, this shit blows my socks off. straight through the wall behind me and into the neighbours yard
seems good
Played D2 to this kind of music
08,01Iron_Edge: i'm not sure. maybe manchester again. and yes, i'll still be chairman.
Saturn: Well, alright then I'll be there :)
08,01probably Heathrow
NIGHTWISH YESH!

Everything exists

500 cheerilees ^-^
>..
>
cant see shit
lol!
Nick, you are a 13Reshiram.
o.o :D
Saturn: I'm alright with it to a point. Sometimes it can be used to touch up the singer's voice. Other times (like with Nightwish IMO) it turns the singer's voice into something that feels too synthetic to enjoy.
hardly
it only uses 12% of cpu though
oh no...
http://scootaloo.com/
anyway night all
*victorian
I'm back guys
14night Nick!
I think it's like the glam-punk era or something

no, its someone thats not that
even though it is that
Yeah, Nightwish
I'm learning how to play the piano

Hey, everyone.
I'm still at beginner's level...
Egad, I'm hearing Phantom of the Opera
This on repeat.
The whole time
Hardly live: she's not with the band anymore.
TUOMAS
Isn't this in phantom of the opera?
05last of the wilds
05is one of my favs
That IS Phantom of the Opera.
Yeah...
Wow...
Again, not proud.
I'll say it again: that singer is not with the band anymore. Therefore, it's not live.
I was, yes.
08,01so i'm getting to go to a lecture by Noam Chomsky on Tueday
Acctually, thirteen for most of it.
Gnome Chomski?
11,01Yeah.
Chompski*
Why do I know that name?
/me 11,01tastes
*yawn* Hay everypony.
08,01Alicorn_Prince_Shane: a linguist and philosopher
Whoa, that was in the soprano vocal region :O
08,01he's famous for his liguistics work, as well as being an awesome anarchist
08,01http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky
05that was the first kassete
05many more were to come
lol Saturn
11Yay
0,14So, Saturn, would you say he's a cunning linguist?
08,01SaxyPretender: do ho ho
08,01SaxyPretender: if i was female, i'd let you know on wednesday.
0,14XD
Yeah she did
Around 2005.
08,01if i was female, i'd totally seduce Noam Chomsky
Would you anyway?
05DocSane: its on the front page
0,14the mixing was baaaaaaaaaaad though
i haves them all
08,01did you know that every time the Golf Open is in St Andrews (a tiny, tiny university town in Scotland), Hugh Grant comes and sleeps with students?
Watching*
Saturn: lol
seems legit, saturn
Saturn dayum
11BroKnee: XD

Saturn..
08,01wrek got wrek'd
That was um..
Informative?

hahaha
how do yall guys no when some one got kicked?
08,01sagas: eat lots of curry and not die
11Wrek: XDDD
05as i was saying
08,01hahaha
Saturn: where u going
11Rofl.
LOL DAT KICK
Saturn: Die by curry. dysantary, or mugging?
oops allcaps
08,01sagas: by illness, indians, or otherwise
I be back
nuh uh
lol
ikr saturn
05Sumica: why do you think i get 24/7 online? :P
Saturn: definitly RD
05computer starts? autologin
Saturn Fluttershy
Saturn: me
Twilight
05etc
08,01sagas: visiting temples, chatting to indians, whatever
Saturn: Fluttershy.
08,01i'm sure i can find us *plenty* to do
seems legit saturn
Saturn: Oh I dont doubt it
08,01i kinda want to travel around eating things
00,10and I never power down is how I have the 24/7
08,01but i also want to absorb the culture
Saturn: always a fun time
I was never crazy about Fluttershy's or Pinkie's gowns.
05sudden... dress change
08,01i really liked Fluttershy's
08,01but my favourite was Rainbow Dash's
Saturn /)
Hole*
Saturn: /)
Saturn yNO
08,01because you'd never expect her to wear a dress
Saturn Cutest was Fluttershy's tho
Saturn: I honestly liked her "armor" get up
Saturn: RD looked fierce, yet elegant in hers
I dunno, I preferred Twilight's gown.
Lesson: Tomboy's can be hot
That bookish student type reveals her beauty.
05otakon: tomboys were already hot
Saturn: Ping, also RD definately looked great
02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
05implying?
I liek Twilight's bangs :3
08,01sort of like she was cross-dressing as a girl
seems nice saturn
Saturn: =/
11,01Pinkie's is the worst.
11,01RD's is the best.
05DuskShine: music and awesome discussions, ikr?
Ugh, I dunno if hilarious or sad
brb
I think Pinkie's was the worst one.
I havbe the mane 6 on my screen
Pinkies was the worst failed one..
11.â€¢10Â«11WB10 (Kosoveon10) 11WB10Â»11â€¢. 10- since the aforementioned eggs aren't even fertilized
11,01Fluttershy would take #2.
Agreed.
Actually, I liked Applejack's digs
Pinkie's dress was a totally overdone concept.
Well this nick is pretentious.
Applejack was kinda cool.
But I like it.
I'll keep this nick for a bit.
05oh look
05a cover
The thing is, Fluttershy could pull off wearing that dress. Pinkie just looked lijke a clown.
05this gotta be good
The saddle thing was a weird idea in season 1.
Gah
Excuse me: SAPIENT.
There's a differrence between setience and sapience
05prefer sapient
it just goes to hsow it was once a WORLD OF HUMANS!
Oh, by the way, hi everyone. How are things going?
05Reikim: jsut fine. epic music and sapience discussion goign down
08,01sapience?
05i proably spelled that wrong too
08,01oh, i see
08,01had to read further up
05expand the genepool!
oh goddammit now my stream is slowing down
Saturn: Where did you say we might be taking the train to?
08,01sagas: starting off at Hyderabad
dat ikea erotica
:3
Dat hair.
08,01sagas: i mean, first place we're visitn would be Hyderabad
Saturn: and of proper age of consent, of course.
08,01maybe then to the north east
Saturn: Never heard of the place
05RAWRity: age of consent is a relative factor
Excuse me. Gonna run down the street for an ice cream cone.
08,01RAWRity: well, yes, depending on their age of maturation, and whether they have such a concept
wat
Saturn: We shall swim in the rivers!
08,01remember, i'm not discounting non-mammals
08,01sagas: eeww, but sure
Saturn: I know :D
I lost track of the conversation..
08,01DuskShine: we're talking about sex with sapient beings
brb
Sapient being homo-sapien right?
Saturn: Oh pansexuality?
omg boo ya! :D
08,01DuskShine: sapience means self-aware -- literally, "thinking"
08,01homosapiens means "the thinking man", essentially
08,01like homoerectus means "the upright man"
Saturn: Neandertals?
Y'know.
05within the boudnries laid earlier
This is an odd discussion.
It's fine on my end
seriously, it was fine earlier
Saturn: I believe parots have been proven to be self aware. How bout them?
Saturn: Not in that order, I hope.
0,14I'm loving the vocals for this song
oh, that's wacky. I come back to Nightwish after listening to some Nightwish.
08,01Reikim: well, yes
xD
and the PAUSING
08,01i mean, kille dmost of them, then interbred with the rest
08,01they have less neanderthall in them
They are sapient..
Saturn: -_-
Hooray for being half-Chinese.
Saturn: wat
See, that can go on FSTDT.
Not that i would EVER sex with a pony.
That disturbing.
GET ME THE BRAIN BLEACH
Saturn: still, humans. "pure" breeding leads to birth defects and other defects as the breeding of dogs have shown.
Or are they?
The mane 6 keep making a conga line across my screen
Dun dun dun..
05hops back and forth
05so fun
Cya.
05DuskStarshimmer|gone
05lol
Saturn: I try to be
DuskStarshimmer|gone: take care
05then he left for it being there
Bye DuskStarshimmer|gone

sure, why not
08,01i should learn more about paleoanthropology
http://www.speedtest.net/result/2014460681.png AND YET IT BUFFERS GODDAMMIT
05so now we are discussing the different types of fanfictions? no thanks, i want to enjoy wishmaster
^

okay wait
Saturn: Depends which half is fish.
08,01Reikim: have *you* ever heard of a fishtop mermaid?
Saturn: Fish genitals dont sound like fun
Saturn: Yes, but I'd rather not get into it. *shudders*
05best sex ever
The problem is discussing this just feeds into the terrible preconceptions people have about pony fans.
05...
but still, like Liara in Mass Effect
uhhhh.......

-lol
08,01Wrek: hahaha
08,01<3
BLUE CHICK FROM A MONOGENDERED RACE IS OKAY TO GET IT ON WITH.
http://derpy.me/52HAN
08,01otakon: monogendered race... my dream
Saturn: all females
Saturn: Asari
08,01RAWRity: eeewww
08,01asari have boobs and penii?
08,01how do they reproduce?
Saturn: just a womb
*mind
Saturn: They reproduce with different races.
Saturn: they splooge onto flowers
05so that in the future when the US finally says "ok we lied we has aliesn" that we can get it on
Saturn: there just blue women
Saturn: they merge nervous systems with another Asari or anything with a sapient nervous system
Saturn: think aphids basically
also, a summation of this entire convo: http://derpy.me/6eqNc
lets just say magic
08,01stabby stabby sex
0,14...dat riff
05extra pair of lips to play the flute
Saturn: kind of, but not cat like, or 12 feet tall, and NO males. Everyone of them is strictly female by genetics
05or the soupdrinker
05happy harry ftw
05(regarding na'vi
08,01otakon: oh, right
O.o
Bah.
05otakon is a hypocrite for saying asari are OK, but ponies are not
How long has this consert been on?
05casue both are sapient
05MUAHAHA
05THE DRAAAMA I AM CAUSING
Saturn: I'd mock you if I didn't agree. =.=
Saturn: They were just blue cat people -lol
You know sometimes when i come back from lurking and found a disscusion like this, the only thing i can do is keep lurking and laugh for a while.
08,01Iron_Edge: yum yum.
Saturn: :D
08,0112 foot tall cat people
Um, I just came back to this IRC just now but Asari are humanoid. Ponies are not.
Saturn: -lol yeah those critters had some height :D
08,01Kandarihu|BuddyBear: they're closer in biology to us, being mammals
08,01humanoid ponies are just... kinda creepy
08,01it's the uncanny valley thing
Whats an Asari?
I don't know if I have anything to contribute :P
Saturn: I think I actually would prefer doing it with a pony versus the humanoid things....they creep me out as well -lol
Saturn: okay, anthro ponies creep me out a bit but I have no problems with well drawn humanized ponies
wat
Oh
Ill prefer the inteligent humanoid to the unconsenting pony
is the stream lagging or is it going just fune
Hmm, adding BuddyBear to the end of my nick isn't enough.
there we go

Here we go again with the MLH
you have to admit, twilight does look pretty good in that pic
She put a bag on my head!
05RAWRity: too much anime for my taste
Still Counts!
Ponies are less intelligent than children, making them unable to consent. Its like child rape
08,01sagas: real ponies, yes
05but we arent talkign about real ponies

Saturn: And thats were I side with saturn logic XD -lol
08,01we're not talking about having sex with horses
No we are NOT
08,01well, okay, we are talking about having sex with horses
08,01but sapient horses
clop ?
Saturn: Were talking about sapient ponies! >:3
I'm back, everypony.
wat
Saturn: sapient miniture horses, have to keep that part in mind
Ponies would not want to sleep with humans.
08,01otakon: or alternate dimension beings, or government experiments, or the next evolution of equines
Sapient horses? Its not my thing but if they are intelligent to comprehend and make their own decision, I have no problem with it
Here's a thought: are the ponies really horses or something different entirely?
05sagas: thats the point
Although they would likely kill/crush you in the process

Well, considering Celestia's the only adult in the room on that show.
For the most part, Ponies would view humans as hairless apes.
yes they would
Because we ARE hairless apes.

The thing is, Ponies make friends with other species easier than we do.
13sumica streamed sg1 once
13i have both
Not that far!
We fucking kill each other over whether or not a piece of bread turns into flesh.
05sagas: i fail to see waht you are trying toa dd to the conversation
*Tip hoofs into chat*
Ponies would be pretty horrified by that.
12damn right you are
00,10heh
Honestly, I think the ponies would be a little freaked out by us at first but then they would warm up to us(assuming we don't try to kill them like the dumbasses we are)
sad right
Counter strike is good
http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/206181_10150974744926385_156770304_n.jpg
It's also possible that Ponies alter their environment and would alter us.
no where as good as TF2
We'd probably study them non-invasively.
Seriously, they make the seasons change. They could probably turn us into a friendlier species.
I WOULD!
BUT THEN AGIAN
I mean, this is pure speculation.
05well the term, to be "humane" or whatever refers to being able to care and value others, right?

05then again. could one call say, tehcnological adaption and progress a kidn of evoltion?
Nightwisk
(\
and me? Predijudiced? wtf, how does that even work?
This song: good intramentals...but where is the vocals' story and/or appeal....
i belive
Evolution is an adaptation to ones situation
they are doorbells, not people
Think about that for a sec
that a evolution in tech/social/relgious style over time is evolution
Okay, enough! Ice cream! I'll be back!
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/293/814/0cf.png

08,01that's why i have a beard

We lost ! Get over it !
13reason?
frekin judgers
Some of my favorite actors never won any oscars or emmys. The awards do not determine the quality.
Nitt: Fair, though I'd point out that the Madagascar franchise's animation isn't exactly spectacular quality and I can probably come up with a few shows I'd rather see in that spot.

Didn't say it was bad, Nitt, only that it's not the first show I'd name for Emmy status. >>
by far
dem people don't know how to join a server
the awards don't really matter in the grand scheme of things. Would it be somewhat nice for some of the creative folks behind the show to be recognized? Sure. But it doesn't change a damn thing in the grand scheme of things.
No stream right now? I don't have a stream.
