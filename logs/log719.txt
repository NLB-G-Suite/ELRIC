It's broken in like 5 different ways.

HAAPPPYY?!
Scary
NO ONE'S HELPING US ;.;

Derpy Hooves/Ditzy Doo 2012
That teeth grinding hurts me.
Let your hate flow through you.
Joy Joy
This goddamn rage containment
Rarity would be a terrible, terrible mother.
best part
XylemTube: ...No, it's an older sister being annoyed by her younger sister. IE, normal sibling thing.
don't cry SB
seriously
Suddenly: APPLEBLOOM!
Well come one!! Rarity has Work to do! :9
AttackWithHugs: GGOOOOODDDD
*:(
I feel sorry for the ponies who had to get those stars impaled in their heads
KAOS is never organized. Then neither is Control
05,15cowvarkian yeah, but it also does the other.
Sarcasm Belle is best belle
AttackWithHugs: Let the rustled jimmies flow through you.......
What's that statue in honour of?
SIHOVI!

Also evening Bronystate.
We need to be able to trust the outcome of this election, for one thing. Regardless of who wins, there are going to be charges of the election being rigged or stolen by whoever wins. And if that takes hold, NEITHER of them are going to win, and our Republic is toast.
Hi, Conyst. :)
SpeedyBolt: What stars impaled in whose heads? D:
Hi Conyst
well thats not nice
twilight_sprinkle: votes dont matter
HATE
"Rarity will think it's a great idea!" "What a rediculous idea!" :D
05,15Also, I know how Rarity feels. I hate it when people try to clean my work space. I know where everything is. Just because it looks messy doesn't mean it is.
Rarity's idea of child care is to stick her little sister in a room and ignore her.
Midnight_Fyre: :D
Aj : What DiddyaSay 'Bout mah Home?
fluttercry: ikr
IF THE WORLD ISNT GOING TO LOVE ME, I'LL MAKE IT FEAR ME INSTEAD
twilight_sprinkle: but votes dont matter
Uncouth
if the world isn't going to love me THEN I'LL TEACH IT TO FEAR ME INSTEAD!!!
Sweetie Belle...HONESTLY
uncouth?
If the world wont love me, i'll teach it to FEAR ME INSTEAD!
HA
Emotion there right there
cowvarkian: got any proof?
HA
time for a lot of voice cracks
DocSane: That's good child care! I'm going to Moe's
dat voice crack
twilight_sprinkle: electoral college
05,15In theory, the votes guide the Electoral College.
Every time Sweetie Belle has a voice crack, drink!
VOICE CRACK!
she goes through ten different facial expressions in two seconds
That must be so difficult to do as a voice actress.
D':
fluttercry: even though it doesnt matter who anyone votes for?
I like the Rari-pout
I love you rarity <3
>Difficult
>Tabitha
Rari-pout is best pout
...How dare you, she's a god :U
Applejack is best jack
I love AB in this epiosde.
cowvarkian: thats not proof
>me
SQEEEE APPLEJACK <3 <3
e/i
How can someone be a bad sister too sweetie belle...
05,15cowvarkian it does. The Electoral College votes for what the majority in that state voted for
Belching has never been so cute
00,10need to write to 0 first Kurra
^
That uncouth Applebloom
*^^
applejack is best background pony
RAWR! Did I scare ya? Wait - what war crime
twilight_sprinkle: whatever you say, george
HUNEY
08,01i love the tension between Rarity and Applejack
Kurra: The problem is that there's no standard for voting. 50 states = 50 different systems.
no she wont
fluttercry: Im sure it does
Just wait for her to die sisters always do
Indeed DocSane.
05,15Now, if you voted for the loser, then yeah, your vote pretty much meant nothing.
Y'know, this may be one of the most flawless episodes.
08,01i'm not sure what shipping is cuter: AJxRarity or AJxRD
fluttercry: which is why ohio is the only state that matter
OJ: heart warming
fluttercry: but isnt it always like that?
In Tennessee, the votes are done by paper ballot which is fed into a vote counting machine.
I love this scene
*matters
00,10damn AJ is strong
OohShiny: That too
08,01wait
and another voice crack
These ads had BETTER not be popping up when I'm watching S3 on here...
fluttercry: And if you voted for the third party canidate. "Go ahead, throw your vote away!"
then apple jack beats apple bloom
08,01why do they keep pigs?
is it absolutely flawless
lol
HEAD SHOT
Impaled
voice crack
08,01the only thing you get from pigs is meat
haha
To make football
3gethe
Buffering
08,01and ponies are vegetarain
The difference between AJ and Rarity is, of course, that AJ isn't completely self-centered.
05,15Yeah, third party votes are meaningless
00,10waste disposal
anyway obama is going to win
Opal doesnt give a
chat ded :(
Sparkarez: Get addbloker
dat Opal
IDEA
And truffles
0,14they probably use them for truffles?
Kurra, indeed. And there are going to be U.N. observers from these dictatorships to "monitor" the election, but only in the red states.
Sparkarez: It shouldn't, but maybe you shold get adblocker
we don't have hard proof that ponies are stricty vegetarian.
Opalescence is best cat
I really wanted to write in Derpy Hooves on my ballotl, but I ended up voting for one of the major candidates who I don't like just to keep peace in my household
cachi01|scaryshit: indeed
I say we all vote Chewbacca
and there is that photo I made you guys guess
Bet you feel bad now, dont you?
/me knows like 200 stereotypes, half-truths,and FULL truths and horrible legacies about many groups, countries, and races, but he isn't about to go talk 'em all.... well except about furs, because we some freaky freaks yo.

Yeah....grape juice >_>
I go do other stuff while the episode's on, then come back to observe the lottery.
so naive, so cute :)
00,10could also use to seek out mushrooms
Grape juice is the best juice.
time to die
Where do you think the Apple family keeps their still?
Reap
ill burn yer whole house down
00,10but that's less likely
>_>
and then Applebloom choked to death and died
Kurra, and yet not all furries are dangerous wierdos.
lol XylemTube
OJ: behind the barn
GRAPED
indeed.
05,15Same. I've seen the episodes too many times
SpeedyBolt: .......
they call it grape juice to avoid taxation
Kandarihu|Zoro: just some of them
what there purple anyway
Not really, though.
OJ: In the secret room in the back of the barn
cowvarkian: It has to be out of sight righT?
It's funny, because her cat hates her.

04FEELS
EMOTIONAL SCENE
What a terrible drawing, she should feel ashamed!
cowvarkian, I read that there are certain stages to furry fandom, and the more extreme they are, the MUCH fewer in number they are.
0,5Dat broken heart
GAAAAH ;_:
Cowas and Sheep are obviously second-class citizens in Equestria.
HNNNNNNNGGGGGG
inb4 she destroys it
Potato Rarity
and then drama
Wine and Cider/Moonshine, Sweet Apple Acres has all your alcoholic needs covered
05,15I felt nothing during this scene

DRAMA!
Gone with the wind
Oh shit i made it back for movie night
What have i done
Join the Navy Feels today!

What a drama queen;)
Search "yay" on google. MLP FIM is one of the very first suggestions :)
GONE WITH THE WIND REFRENCE!
NEVER BE SISTERLESS AGAIN!!
I SHALL NEVER BE SISTERLESS AGAIN
;) YEAAH
Technially, sheep cannot survive by themselves. They need a leader, otherwise they'll most likely end up dead and scattered frin their group.
Has anyone ever written a story about the Apple family still? There is some potential for a great comedy fic there
When I saw Rarity cry, I wanted to cry, the first time I ever saw this.
Rarity would be perfect for a soap opera.
....
Just....
yeah cuz genetics
harrumph!
*from
Harumph
disowned
That Rarity happy face :).
It's time for the sheep to rise up and overthrow their pony masters. sic semper tyrannis!
I <3 That reference
Rarity:"Remember this scene when it's Academy Award Time!"
scoff
....
Sheep know the voice of their shepherd. <3
That's why I uninstalled you from my hardrive and installed Applejack as my new sister
yay
Pale_Horse: yes
05,15Lawless/MLP crossover with BigMac running a bootlegging operation
05,15...I like where this is going
Pale_Horse: it makes sense

Hoof KNOCK pwnt

What a twist
BUY SOME APPLEES
00,10and yet they already have a fundraser concert for that huracane on HBO right now
Technically, we can be considered to be one of the more benign classes of furries. Fans of Looney Tunes, even more so.
Buy some apples

Is the lesson of this episode supposed to apply to boys with big sisters?
....
OJ: sure
Don't you need legally disown her first, Applebloom?
00,10applebell?
It could...
00,10sounds like fastfood

CrimsonPhoenix, I heard that as "Heart Drive"
Fun level: 0%
Applejack, why are you so good and make me look so bad

Great Rarity line
0,14I really liked Secret of My Excess
I can't believe people actually ship Rarity and Sweetie Belle...
OJ, not sure. Battle of the sexes becomes a factor, there. Perhaps.
skype sometimes does that to me. It thinks that everyone of my contacts decided to call me
05,15Tabitha has such an awesome voice
hm, tractor huh
00,10what, ewwww
Tabitha is the best VA
now for best bg pony's wise words
Just randomly when I log in
04Southern analogy ahoy
0,14that and her scenes in Dragon Quest are probably my favorite Rarity eps
But Apple Pie is delicious...
It's really annoying
APPLE PIE
My sister and I are not apple pie
...
Applejack going Wilson on us
Tabitha has yet to be matched by fans
Sparkarez, the internet is a scary place sometimes.
I Dun Like Applepie :c
Can I have pecan pie instead?
Try it on a phone when you have a call and can't answer it because skype decides to freeze
I like pie crusts. :)
00,10.......so where do they get the rubber for ballons?
I want cherry pie ouo
I have a big brother, but he's gone at college
Dragon Quest is my fav episode.
dat derpy
Just the adventure
if Applejack drinks applejack... does it count as Inception?
He's gonna explode
NOI <3
thats some pig
Go Dinky and Sparkler
Applejack + Pinkie Pie = Applepie
and Rarity is in it too <3
Is it me
but only together do you have a complete rattlesnake
so, what are pigs for?
Sumica: trees
thats a big pig

04Two more things for this BMN folks
05,15HEAR YE HEAR YE
04Firstly, Wrek would like to say something. Unfortuantely, he couldn't make it tonight so I was asked to post this for him:
0,5ib4
04I wish to leave a formal apology to the chat at #Bronystate for streaming the episode "war on pornography" brought by the show "Penn & Tellers Bullshit" on the 18th of October this year.
04Admitting that showing that particlar episode conflicted with the current code of conduct of http://www.bronystate.net/, and that I personally do not condone overly explicit material neither streamed nor discussed in the sites chatrooms, and that I apologize for any inconvenience it might have caused.
04As such I am relieved of the privilege to stream for the site starting as of the incident day for a month forward, leaving this suspention to end the 18th of November 2012.
/me 11,01dances with Meanwhile
04^^^^^^^All of those three entries are Wrek's
My eyes are up here Nitt.
/me dances on Meanwhile
0,5RaveBrony: There was an announcement :P
Oh :o
what announcement?
04Alright, and secondly, you may or may not have heard round the campfire that our SuperBrony64 will be in attendance as a guest at EQLA
11,01Sorry.
Where is Reikim at? His picture is Outstanding!!
0,14we have a campfire?
04As many of you already know, Equestria LA starts tomorrow! For those who can't make it to the convention, BronyState will be providing live coverage of the event. There will be text and image updates on everything that goes on. Be sure to go to http://www.twitter.com/ConCrusaders to follow @ConCrusaders on Twitter for all these updates live at the convention! If you have any suggestions
4for what you would like to see covered there, send it over to superbrony64@bronystate.net!
We have a SuperBrony64?
He doesn't come on irc much but I'll tell him you said so.

greatest advice ever
Yeah, this movie is definitely the greatest

Eh the cow still holds the high jump record
Of all the scenarios that paranoid fliers have to worry about? Shark attacks are a new one.
Sumica: maybe it made a 10/10 reentry!
just for a good laugh
mac?
this is such a great movie :D
Top comment on trailer for this movie on YouTube: "my biggest fear when﻿ flying..."
yay is right
Very true it also never talks with you.
HOw could the afford a macbook?
^ THAT
04"Will you quit playing that Spanish Guitar in my room?"
I think we should play it in black and white and at 8kHz XD
It's a batleth
"It's just a whale! Only in the air!"
Next up: Megashark takes out a sattelite.
In Asylum movies, shark jumps you!
"Don't love the ocean, it doesn't love you back" <-- truth hurts. The ocean will eat your children and take your nintendo.
yay cheap plastic!!
Meanwhile: it makes you wonder why the Talibahn doesnt hire megasharks
^ Shark's thoughts.
08,01more Bach
WMC for this
Hey, Oceanography is big business...
08,01no idea which one, though
This background music is just so unfitting.
Megashark eats the moon
Even if you are a freaky fish guy.
Ten thousand feet or so in the air.
Seriously
shark will jump up and eat that bird
Never WMC this movie.
Its public domain, thats why.
no,you can't wmc something that's so stupid it becomes funny
And can they stop cutting to 50 different locations all the time?
i agre
not WMC material
wooo california
and guess what
now were in cally
Do the locations really matter?!
It seemed kind of low down.
El Kabong - background music composer
we should watch birdemic
Randomiser: That's the sequel
it goes against a giant squid
well its not WMC yet at lesa
5 yeus
Irish?
Don't WMC this movie, please. :D
*least
11,01This movie is too much fun.
04"Like, five minutes?"
oh god
/me doesn't know how to feel about this movie now
Drunken arse.
too many accents
this movie won't be WMC'd
Dat Irish....
Mica
04Lady, you do realize you're talking to a drunken Irish hobo?
pony_5324: I agree wholeheartedly.
honestly I'm wonrdering how they will possibly top a shark jumping into the clouds to chomp on a plane.
The luck o' the oirish.
IM IRISH :D
Ghosties: Can we have a Worst Movie Clause night one time?
If you keep saying WMC, I'll pick Southland Tales for B.
he's Irish-ish...
The WMC potential for this movie died the moment the Mega Shark ate the jetliner
I doubt this guy is authenticly Irish.
tell me about it dick
I bet this had a bigger budget than Twelve Angry Men
I don't give a fuck for the buffers
lul
I don't get the saying "Luck of the Irish"
04I've been pushing for one Spazturtle
THE INSTITUTE

THEY WHAT
Favorite student...It's Princess Celestia!
They were nearly wiped out because they ran out of potatoes.
04But we just haven't found the right time
wtf does that mean?
Im Irish <3 :3
MEGASEAGULL
If there's anything less lucky for a people, I'd love to hear it.
Ireland= beauty
11,01I'm against a WMC night. It'll bore you to tears.
no,wait...
"H a h a. Funny you should ask".
I am not paying attention to the story, cuz it has nothing
its kindof quiet
Ghosties: April 1st?
It's ironic
shark based horror films are stupid if the option of staying out of the fucking water is an option
04Wubstep: Like fully Irish? From Ireland?
The laugh was so authentic.
The birds...and flashes.
Okay. My mother is watching the movie and she is VERY irritated by the pings.
dat monitor
This movie is offically Black and white flashes/10 for me
stop showing that!
SO MANY BLACK WHITE FLASHES
fwoosh
Yes Ghosties
SCIENCE!
Time for science.
I still say it was batman, that's totally a giant batarang.
04Very nice, sir
lol
05,15But that's why Jaws worked, because it was a resort town and the mayor was an idiot
This is like watching Bones
lets exam this hi c drink
who wants to watch Snakes on a Plane next loll
Then it turned into a huanted house movie.
Time for bad CSI ripoffs
Seagulls eat puffin eggs. I don't like them
COMPUTERS DON'T MAKE THAT SOUND
this movie is more black and white than 12 angry men
and this cool aid
Kandarihu|Zoro: you have an awesome mom if she comprehends the humor of BMN, I think :)
oh man, they're sciencing super hard right now
Im a Girl xP
04I'd like to visit your country sometime, Wubstep
0,5I'm sorry I can't sit through the restof this
Do you mind muting the pings, Sumica? :)
SOAP was epic
CSI from the dollar store
Time for science.
0,5Im off to play skyrim!
they are really changing time
you've got mail
04And noted~
Red liquid = science.
Oh look, the other mod I wanted to bug.
This isn't science, this is what lazy lab assitants do when pretending to work.
bye BaconMane
FC
You know, the black and white flashes should have some sort of meaning beyond "I think it looks kinda cool."
See ya BaconMane
We understand BaconMane
BaconMane is cared of this movie
So bad ripoffs of bad ripoffs?
and has an awesome acronym
The Wii-level CGI and the occasional greying back and forth makes me feel like we're watching a video game more than anything.
05,15And this shark jumped 30 thousand feet. He's dangerous!
When are you running another contest?
Science MONTAGE!
Grey anatomy
<3
Bye, BaconMane. :)
So much science.
so if its gray it is past?
Kurra, I read some of the good jokes, and she likes it. But she's just watching the stream.
DURRRRR
WOW

this for some reason reminds me of the hulk movie the one where the hulk got bigger the angrier he got
just look at that computer. so much science
OohShiny does bones have a flying shark that royally screw planes? no. no it doesnt
Deerrrrrr, a tooth?
WHAT THE HECK DID YOU THINK IT WAS?

Ten by Eleven feet.
05,15Reikim I'm not certain. There are no plans for one in the near future but that could change
They did that to figure out that it's a tooth
Well, she's stupid.
Crystal Empire looks SOO awesome!
Miles
Fun, I look forward to it.
you're the scientist-guy
Miles? Parsecs!
ALL THAT SCIENCE MONTAGE, JUST TO FIND OUT ITS A TOOTH!!!

Or rather the Airplane caused Global Warming. Global Warming revived the Megalodon, the Megalodon ate the plane. So really the airplane destroyed itself... eh?
....Why should we?
well actually...
Lady screw you, blow the things to bits.
We never really capture them
Mega Vinyl Shark and Giant Octaviapus... Am I first to think of that?

That lady on the phone a minute ago.

That guy is actually not too bad of an actor compared to the others.
LASSIE?!
Sumica: They probably don't see many attractive women in their line of work
Headed towards Tokyo? Heh, movie's over. Godzilla and Gamera will take care of it
There's a giant shark.

I get the feeling this movie will end suddenly. I dunno why
There's a giant octopus.

TheGreatAndPowerfulT, you missed Air Jaws: Extreme Edition and an octopus.

There's horrible, cardboard romance.
And that's it.

Ohmaigawd I have a habit Of Saying Lassie : D
Y'know, the time I spent watching this movie, I could have been working on my self-insert My Little Pony fanfiction.

Oh don't start getting pretentious, movie.
Why are you thinking about Einstein and Oppenheimer?!

Einstein..? He was a physicist, you're a biologist, what's the connection?

I freakin love it
11,01In universe wherever.
Did Oppenheimer work on that?
DOn't you tell by mah acting
Actually, in an infinite series of parallel universes, there exists at least one reality where the plot of this movie isn't ridiculous. :P

Not hard to find when the text is orange.

Brilant? you should have figured it out looog before now

DocSane: bodyguards?
Get them together in the same space together... THEN NUKE THEM!

Megashark is the hero California needs right now, but not the one it deserves.
05,15Thrilla in Manilla
00,10also how did they get frozen mid combat
oi, shark, octopus said yer mas a slag
DocSane: Cause helmets are for the weak and sunglasses kick ass
05,15I think it was a big boxing event
WHEN do we get to the shark octopus fight?
I see no vs action

Aniamls are known for hate

I would call for the BIG LIPPED ALLIGATOR MOMENT joke......but this ''dream sequece'' actually affects the plot

Biltzwing: Because pony
Blitzwing: Because crappy movies like this have nothing to do with MLP
05,15This plan is so perfect it can't fail
why are they not considering that?
JAPS
And what happens when a victor emerges from the maelstrom?
They're like, what? 20 feet apart?
Look, you've got a whole ocean in which to make them fight.
It's not hard to choose a location.
Every fifteen minutes? Not fourteen minutes and fifty-nine seconds?
DocSane actually, 21 and a quarter
Biltzwing: because you loved it the first time you became one, now dont let this shitty movie ruin it and FIGHT THE POWER
Kandarihu|Zoro: we crown out our new king and worship it!
Kandarihu|Zoro: Godzilla kills the winner
Crippler: Oh, look at the time. 1941 already.
Deadlypon3: Not even him in all of his skill can save the film
They're really getting their moneys' worth out of that one set.
This movie would be more intersting if the Vs. part were to actually happen any time soon
"Go to sick bay...ON MY DICK!"
how long is this movie
Kandarihu|Zoro: It's weakened
Dark92Enigma in all his fatness

Sumica: the one that transforms into a plane
Deadlypon3: BA DUM (tss)
But who's gonna lure them to the location?
the light is making me green
I like twlight sparkle's plan. Welcome new overlord!
Strangely this movie isn't as ridiculous as "Chupacabra Terror" with John Rhys-Davies. There the monster was only the size of a man... Yet managed to devour an entire freaking cruise ship in about an hour... and yet it was somehow surviving on only the occasional small animal on the small island it was on beforehand... Yeahhhh.... :|

It was a bad idea to watch Poultrygeist so soon before watching this.
05,15Do you think the actors in this movie know they suck?
Blitzwing: 2009
Poor gguy
am i the only one that cant listen to there consverations?
So far, this woman has done nothing but destroy anything that comes in contact with each other
Biltzwing: 2007

well i could be wrong
No, it doesn't make any sense!
Distorted windows screen
fluttercry: its a B movie of course they do
If they were good actors, they wouldn't be in an Asylum film.
00,10lets see what other great films they were in
Oh please.
:|
boooo
fluttercry: I don't even think they know they're acting
By this late in the filming, if they know they suck, they're just looking at that paycheck to wipe this film off their plate.
yay! words !
Wut is a c movie like i wonder
fluttercry: I wonder if they just don't give a shit.
That's the vibe I get.
Sumica: Alrightie, what other shitstorms did they perform in?

There's some words from Julius Ceasar... "Oh! Sweet Jove! I've been stabbed!" :O

Fuck That guy
UNACCEPTABLEEEE!
SafariMonkey: Yea Same, but there was little to no way they were going to make a shark 3x bigger than a battleship leaping into the clouds make much sense, especially with Asylum at the helm of the movie

hey CrazyHippie. A very bad movie.
4 songs in the whole movie
2/10
CrazyHippie: a shit movie
Ghosties: Probably a college student who needed money but didn't want his name stained on this
I am going to cry myself to sleep knowing this movie exists.
fluttercry: So does the Visual Effects Supervisor. He feel asleep on the job
CrazyHippie: The greatest movie to ever grace the earth.
04Tiny Juggernaut da bess
fgbggr
I dozed off during the movie's climax. But not because it was boring. I doze off during better movies than this.
i dont think i had enought AppleJack Daniel's for that movie
Hi Lunar_Brony and AlienWarhead
00,10cant wait to see the song list
CrazyHippie: Not much, just megasharks with bad CGI

Conyst: Was it THAT bad?
short credits are short
MegaPony
Hi SafariMonkey
ascent media we climax befor we even started
Meanwhile: Good idea. I bet noone would even notice
Ghosties: Humanity won
05,15THIS MOVIE IS FICTION
00,10it was a draw, mankind won
yes
Ghosties, they both just.....stopped
So......for a flik starring a SHARK vs. an OCTOPUS......i'm pretty much underwhelmed.........the acting is horrible, the plot is nonsense, and the way they forced the GLOBAL WARMING in this movie is so forced, as much as the pointless scenes and the ending.............I would complain more about it but.......IT'S OVER NOW! THIS IS THE WORST MONSTER MOVIE EVER :[ 3/10
SEAPONIES
Ghosties: No one. They both died
The audience won, once the credits started rolling.
never AGAIN
OJ my self-insert mary-sue un-original HiE is better than this.
04Yay for Humanity
In movies this bad, nobody wins.
SafariMonkey: 86. AND I LIKED IT
SEAPONIES ALWAYS WIN
and it was BAD
Was the movie that bad?
Dat title
"Why is the octopus now a crocodile?"
Reasons.
oh
CrazyHippie yes
Megalomanic: :D
trick question the predetor won
OJ: Ponies vs Mega Shark and Giant Octopus! avenge the honor of this bastardized concept!!
Ghosties the octopus won, but then he died of old age and blood loss
I saw this movie
U SUCK MOVIE
it sucked
I was born in 86
04Poor Octopus :'(
This movie is very deep it shows that if you fight war like the shark and octopus you both die there is no winner in war that is why i like this movie good theme
Lunar_Brony: You've given me hope
the title is too good for this movie

J_E_Smith71, yes. Derpy stole ONE Applejack-centric episode. But Applejack had another episode in which Derpy didn't speak in.
05,15DocSane That's actually a good question. I tend to stay away from people like her IRL
Pinkie looks good in flour.
That's no place to keep fl;ower, on a high shelf on a wobbley wardrobe, with rambuctious kids running around

DAT MANE
http://mlkshk.com/p/895G
and how you can easily imagine that she's cuddly
What I dislike about FiW, it doesn't make fun of the show, instead it tries to make something entirely different, different mindset, lore, different everything which means lots more work and very limited to work on
inb4 turing test
Darf14: because let's face it, linux does it just as much. :P
I NEED IT. I SHALL HUG IT AL DAY LONG.
CrimsonPhoenix: but the SONGS

Headless Rarity...
MY FAV
meatloaf: a ponified version of the Magicka Puella Madoka intro
whoa she pretty O_O
...Wat.
ah, anime ponies
L_Y_R_A: Thank god someone agrees
Okay this is totally acceptable :O
as i stated before,i'm going to say again how much i hate the italian intro
Humans, in my ponies... Only sometimes! :$
I don't want a MLP Z...EVER.
Oh My! :O
Kurra: you'd be surprised the skill people put into humanized ponies
italian singing with japanese, ....kay
Woona
MLP Z
NO.
Freaking awesome
otakon, I've seen it :3
Pupils? WHO NEEDS PUPILS
it's NOTHING like Powerpuff Z
I would happily fund this
hawt
seriously that show was horrible
HAWT
Touche.
AJ <3
The japanese characters make it look more legit, even though it's just a slideshow.
I thought Bronystate was an English speaking service?
HAAAAAAAWT
Pupils are so 1996.
They made PPGZ because they wouldn't accept the original one.
UGH.
Rule_Pony: it is, hush the videos do not count
D'AWWWWW
yay Derpy!
ohh

OMg Derpy <3 and Vinyl

Dat Twi and Shining Armor was cute

VINYL <3
Rule_Pony we are, doesn't mean whatever's on the stream doesn't have to be
I'm gonna be honest here: I don't know why but I hate humanized ponies.
k bye
I have seen what the Japanese did to MLP. All our clopfics are harmless compared to it. I don't want them to get involved.
Vinyl looked bad ass lol
yes
DEM LEGS
meatloaf: odd, I don't find any issue with them
and wut
meatloaf me too but i liked the anime intro
my little human
aha, cameo
Is MLP even known in Japan? I don't think it's been translated into Japanese yet.
DaringDerpy: I have too...
MADAM FOSTEr
:D
my little human
/me shudders
meatloaf: yeah i dont like them either, it just cant capture the same features as pony form
dem PPG
HUMANS

GET OUT OF HERE
\kind of creepy...
hrm...
HUMANNNNSS
hmm I give them an A for effort
Woah, I NEVER noticed the Power Puff Girls in the background of this video until now
not good enough
not that great, but not bad.
but the designs are drek
Big Mac!!!:D

DaringDerpy: so not a large audience then?
Nyst there are some fans, they love cheerilie and big mac

VenHur: yh I figured
HUSH NOW QUIET NOW ITS TIME TO GO TO BEEEEEED! LISTEN TO ME MUDAFUCKAAAAA

I ask because usually when Japan likes something it comes with a tidal wave of quality fan content, and I'm not seeing any MLP one.
ANGRY SINGING!
germans not bad
hush hush?lol]
damn they sound pissed
i was expecting rammstein
How the HELL did the German singing VA not puke or choke when doing this?
Nyst: it's... it's in the "adult" section
singing hush now
...
Nyst: it burns... do not seek it
00,10and niconico has not got hooked on it yet
this one is good
eddmario: we dont have your fairy vocal chords B)
I like it
i think fluttershy is cute in this one :3
It's weird for niconico to be slow. In anything.
keeps with the tempo
My favorite dub is English. Which country is English again?
argh
Dr_Fumbles: mexico
also the singer actually puts EFFORT INTO IT
it's alright
Englishland?
this one is eh...
Woah, the Italian version sounds almost EXACTLY like the English version.
Dr_Fumbles: dude stop complaining about it
You'd have expected at least a poorly animated miku video with pony models.
otakon: About what?
english is for casuals
D:
whut...
this one is not as good
i dont like the voice they gave to sweetie belle in the latin spanish dub
Dr_Fumbles: all the foreign language
Germanbelle was really good.
this one is not bad but the brazilian version...
this one is okay
but the Italian one was best so far
otakon: But I love them! I was just joking...
otakon Eeyup
Dr_Fumbles: oh thought you were complaining, sorry.
lol, its okay
...
not bad
I'm going to go to sleep now and tomorrow all I'll be able to say is Hush now Quiet nw in 37 different languages AAAAH *grabs his head and pulls on his ears!*
this one is meh
[NOT BAD face]
"Cock sweat it"?

Italian Version is best one. Period.

http://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/e/e3/Cheep_Cheep.png/200px-Cheep_Cheep.png

All of the dubs are good in their own way
Smoker cough
Epic win, Spanish dub.
"There are from 6800 to 6900 distinct languages in the modern world"
No way!
and suddenly sweetiebelle was 10 years older
Mexican Belle!
meatloaf: I fucking HATE those things in Super Mario 3D Land...
ME GUSTA
meatloaf: this isnt mexican
meatloaf spanish
SPanish dub is horrible, Sweetie sounds 40 years old.
sorry force of habit
spain sucks at dubbing
SING COMMRADES

Taco Belle
wat?
somehow i expected more from the arabic version ...
crappy microphone
Taco Belle.
I'm surprised there's an Arabic or Egyptian version of MLP stuff, considering how much they seem to get pissed at the West... :/
If chicks from the south are southern belles, are mexican ones taco belles?
NOOOOOOOOOOO MY EARS!THEY BLEED!!!
the gulf people have infinite money. they could have invested more.

Umm wat.

It's related by AWESOME.
Metronome: what about if u shut uo and enjoy
dat wilhelm
I searched I am not getting anything
It needs more ponies...
Half Portal 3!
This makes sense, sense Portal was orignally a Half-Life 2 mod
Better than waking up in TF2 I guess. :s
Gary Oldman?
Or L4D
u hurt my feelings:'(
Der Epischer Panzerfaust
CROWBAR OF DOOM

YES
Valve, make notes to this video.

We need THIS for a video game.
DaringDerpy: you look gay

Behold, the trailer for Episode 3: Portal 3 edition
Dat last video brought atear to my eye! :'( :$

These guys have good CGI. They should team up with the other guys who made the City 17 movie, they had great combine and rebel costumes.
both are mute
:D
mutes, UNITE!
YES :D
why do they sign?
sup

be
Kurra: They're both mutes.
inb4 they meet the Pyro\
They are??
I didn't know! :o
Kurra: cause they never talk in game so they are considered mutes
the most epic thing ever
Kurra: they never spoke int heir games
Oh well... :/
Kurra: Yep, just like Jak was in his first game.
"No worries! We are from the internets!"
If this was real, I would hugs Valve.
Kurra they never speak in the game so yeah they are
pysgun owns all!
I love how Chell is totally nonchalant about the state of the world she desperately tried to escape to.
We need to show this to valve
:D
00,10shotglass
holy shit O.o
Kurra: chell is confirmed to be mute
I don't remember that gun...
You suck:D
Don't you recal... The talknig part of Chell's brain makes her jump
ouch
lol
Wut
And plus, if THIS camed out, it'll be Half Life AND Portal 3 at the same time. Makes sense.
Dr_Fumbles: cause she just left her endless expermients. she is to mistifed by nature and the outside to concern hereslef just yet

song > video
@_@
CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THIS IS DONE!
I was so hoping this would be released by Nightmare Night
Sumica: agreed lol
oh i love this one
man they are still not done with this and they released a teaser trailer aboutt 45 second long of this
Sumica hey, art takes time
richfiles: you can't rush somethinglike this
I could sing this
00,10you know they are just waiting for a big event to realease it by now
with color
[Alpha]: that was 2 months ago :/
yes mother f the night...you command me...i shall obey...
can someone say what is the name of this video?
I know
Sumica: maybe... like S3 premiere?
Sumica: Like next saturday?
and you try and draw uptenth amount of frames
00,10proably
Katalenic: children of the night
00,10which is silly
Dken2021: minimum of 24 per second
thx cachi01
00,10cause it will be over shadowed by real thing
The person singing this probably could be Luna's singing voice in the show
but that's traditional cell animation
eddmario: i think so
o. o Th
I'm not sure how it works with Flash
00,10they were almost donw with this 2 months ago
eddmario: the person singing this is a disney girl
That Voise Crak*
Crack*
Jesus -_-
the voice crack is just awesome
I'm waiting for this, Season 3, SWAG.MOV, and Fighting Is Magic.
I wonder what is Fighting is Magic up to, now.
Sumica: finishing touches on a project by a small team takes time
Flash has so many shortcuts to create self repeatig cycles. Ou then just twaak and assemble the bits.
I really wanted to see it done by halloween. It would have been so awesome
00,10true but given the speed they had been going at.
it would have been
Spell-of-Gaming more boring updates and whatnots
/me has the leaked fighting is magic
00,10my bet is long done and just draging it out now
Sumica: unforseen complications perhaps?
I dont' know why, but Luna in this preview reminds me of Digimon: Tamers for some reason.
00,10posably, but they have been updateing other projects
I've never played it, but i also have the leaked verion of FiM
I guess cause the animation of her mouth looks like Guilimon's
O This xP
<_>
Ugh, this AGAIN?
WOONA
hooray, time for a bit of dashie
/me brings a giant box of tissues
I was not totally going to snag a copy of Fighting is Magic at Canterlot Gardens...
OH NO NOT THIS
hey
inb4 ManUp.jpg
No....the sadness :'(
NO
For some reason, it took me until the animated preview to realize that the one asleep was Celestia. :S
cuddly_kittehs: can..can I have some?
how can this be sad?
I DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR TISSUES
I tried to get the leaked fighting is magic but...honestly Windows 7 is so mean
00,10radda radda manup radda radda
this is happy as fuck
cachi01: it's the music
/me hands out tisses to the chat
I hear this song in Up.
Wait Spitfire would Of been a filly then o_o
This is more depressing if you already heard the song in Up
I have it somewhere on my Mac. Now that my PC is up and running, I should give it a go, just to see what it's like.
Sumica: dude I KNOW WHAT THIS WAS ATTACHED TO ORIGINALLY. Seriously if you don't get teary eyed at that scene in 'UP' you have no soul.
I wonder if any of the people who got the leaked Fighting is Magic copies hacked into it to see if there was anything hinting at the future characters
otakon: oh yeah. up can make a victory something sad
also I do like the animation here
eddmario: i checked the files
eddmario: theres nothing hidden
damn
richfiles: i hate when that happens XDD

CUTIEMARK!
kawwwi
Hey Sumica do you have that new Luna short that Silly Filly did queued up? The one that's sort of like Children of the Night?
As much as I love RD, there's one video I would consider "sad". I'm not sure what the name is, but it has Pinkie Pie and the music from the "Dead Island" trailer
cachi01: out of 10, what would you give the movie? Also, no spoilers please.
eddmario: 10
trollestia
J_E_Smith71: it's not done yet, he just showed the animatic for it

Sumica: any chance you have the Dr. Whooes and Assistant animated?

Derpy in this is like David Tennant in Time Crash: Complete fangasm
Derpy's thinking, "You can't have the title doctor without being a doctor of somthing..."
he's a scientist
for science
It makes them seem cuter without eyelashes for some reason.
cuddly_kittehs: Actually, it's more like "Muffinsmuffinsmuffinsmuffinsmuffins..."
lol
Well she does have eyelashes when she closes her eyes.
