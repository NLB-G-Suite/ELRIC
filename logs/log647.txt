Aah hehe
If its rap we are talking about, I prefer the oldies.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1rpKfVztcE
hehe
Weird-
I heard the name thou
hehe
I recently --started listening to Beastie Boys, and I'm smitten
I kinda like Rage against the machine too, but they're very political, and I'm not-
no, I'll find my music for free :) or buy it via humble bundles
hehe
aah
not gangsta, but the other one
I like rap, but it's gotta be fun and not just all attitude.
it can have attitude, but meaning as well..
I am great thanks for askin'
Thats good to know :)
I grew up with this http://youtu.be/5mSWupCpm6Y and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLmX7cmhatw
The Madeth one is... interesting.
Hehe, I listened to tons like that, still do-
I guess it was punk meets glam, and in japan they melded
yeah
My parents liked some metallica I think-
Steel pole bath tub is more easily consumable for me.
I listened to just about everything once
Ahh they're great. Steel pole never got the recognition they deserved.. IMO that is
Haha I am listening to Metallica right now :P
There was a pahse when I only listened to hiphop and breakbeat
Most music is nice
it's just different-
yeah
long time breakbeat favorite (cant find the whole song): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWDJtfKMAxg
brrreakbeat
thanks
It's weird how things change, before If I were to buy a drumkit, I'd have tons of tams and cymbals and shit-
now I want one cymbal, no hihat, and 2 tams
Just saying
I like the rythem on that.
it helps A lot
and I can't even play the piano, and it still helps
I'm kinda fine with making the Rhytm by hand, but I just can't make a compelling Meldoy XD
hehe, keys help a lot there- just anything that you can play on
I've written drums in midi by hand since.. 2006 I guess? 2005, but then I played drums for about a year or two, and now I can't..stand how slow it is to do all the variations and flows
aah
yeah, I classmate already halped me out, I'll probbaly buy his old one for 100€ (it's 150 in retail, but he really needs the money currently for his drivers license XD)
also, usd? Hydra apparently hates symbols
100€ it told me
man, listening to those breakbeats now brought up some memories :) www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpETQ3fP3wc
Hydra?
http://youtu.be/yeOvxU7bW4c Jazz can be cool, kids! Don't mock the nerds
HydraIRC client
oh XD
Germany eh? Thomann.de *coughcough* best place to buy music stuffs in Europe imo.
Thomann is Greaat
bought ..two or one bass there, can't remember, EXCELLENT service
Really excellent. I buy everything from them nowdays.
yeah, but if I get a 150€ device for just 100€ that still has guarantee for 1 Yeahr and I can try it out easily + no shipping.... than I'm gonna buy from him XD
yeaah
YEEEEAAAAHHHH!
Thomann is also great cause they have such a huge stock. Things I can't find here I can find there
Likewise.
Hehe, yeah.
o.o
man..I want a cello
Get the money for one then~
/me licks Jmo's teeth
hehehe
300? Wow
Yeah, thomann. <3
Man, even with the taxes and shite that's really cheap
No kiddin' eh.
Maybe I'll buy one, and buy another guitar at the same time-
I really..really want a mustang or jazzmaster
I was looking in a local music shop, in their cheap student budget section. Cheapo yamaha, 900 euro.
yeah, the only cellos I've seen for sale is by the local violinmaker
dabi pls
y u do dis
yus dabi
cuz i can
<3
ic how it is dabi
I know how to play the triangle, I feel involved.
http://www.thomann.de/se/fender_sq_vintage_mod_jazzmaster_sbl.htm aww yeaah It's for sale
hehehe
Yeah
nemnemnemnem
I still have my first bass, but-- it's a fender precision bass, but I got it really cheap from my cousin
Maybe I'm not. :>
;D
Maybe you'll still have that chinese cello in 40 years
Huh, how about that.
Aye.
I'd prefer never.
hehe
Aah, taking hte plunge
but yeah a teacher might be nice, a lot of odd techniques with those instruments
For me it was always an economical thing. Parents went "nope!".
http://youtu.be/gd5H8wTU9_M ARne nordheim Cello piece. Avant garde or musique concrete though
Hehe, yeah. Especially considering that there was no cheap chinese via thomann around back then. =)
yeahh
Aw man this sucks
o.o
"Sooo... You want us to spend 1k eur on something we're 97% sure you're going to break within a year? Uhm, no."
There we go
Aye.
but yeah, thanks man. I think I'm gonna try to pick up that Cello via thomann some day
Bugger
There we go
oh yeah, we have two violins, but I don't know how to play them properly-
They're not mine though, but I like to plunk on them sometimes
Goddammit
hehe, yeah. Go for it. Everything must be learned
Worked out well enough
Well I gotta run, got to pick up things in town. Brb darlings!
The first few exercises are a tad boring though. "D D D D... D D D D..."

#Dashiesauce
someone forgot you are not supposed to post other channels
Hello again guys :)
hey
hi guys! what's up?
nothing much, it seems
feel like a morgue
Hey back guys.
yeah, i see that...
crowdfunding!
very much
he presents his case, his ideam videos and screens
2,14 I dunno, that's just going to give gamers even more reason to bitch about games
that's pretty much all he does
2,14 "I GAVE YOU MONEY TO MAKE THIS GAEM! Y IT NOT EXACTLY HOW I WANTED/EXPECTED IT?"
it's how kickstarter works
wasteland 2 is being developed by crowdfunding too, bte
2,14 yeah, but with tons of people paying rather than a single publisher, "reaching" the goal is a relative term
Allo everyone.
oh, dont underestimate the power of the customers
Well that's a good message to join on. "Spawns hate communities"
2,14 not underestimating their power, I'm just explaining their needless hating and bitchmongering
a day later they were at 1 million
2,14 you're mistaking my point
2,14 I'm not talking about whether money could or could not be raised
What's the actual topic here?
2,14 I was thinking the same thing Dken :P
2,14 nah, the gaming industry
crowd funding and crowd development go pretty close together
2,14 now, with that in mind
2,14 I think it's great if indie publishers find support from communities when publishers wont
I made half of my mega-rainbow dash last night :P took 3 hours and 40 minutes
uploading pics
of course not
2,14 I'm back in college now, which (ironically) means I have much more time available
hi everypony
a
wait a sec
Half of mega-rainbow dash http://i.imgur.com/pTsEs.jpg
2,14 YOU AREN'T MY MOMMY
You're grounded Mister.
:D
2,14 inb4 I mute the channel "NO! YOU'RE GROUNDED!"
Well I am already in my room.
how do you ground that which has power?
Rubber?
Oh!
2,14 How canst thy ground that which is, ungroundable?
Ground doesn't look like a word anymore.
And no one pays for it to spite jar jar binks
Understandable really.
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
School computers. Takes ten minutes to type.
8 hours after schafers click the goal of 400k is reached
Plus it lags like a motherfucker
Meh at least I have Xenosaga to keep me intertained
*entertained
Kinda wish Xenosaga continued its origional plan for 6 games instead of three
AKA ask a bunch of dumb saps to give you money.
Oh I am not refuting that fact.
you guys did listen to me, right?
I think his name is Hark_Dorst or something.
Yeah I read it all.
I was being sarcastic.
That should be on the school plaque.
"Sometimes Bill Nye is on"
that'S the problem this whole thing has. to few people do it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUnMF7dV86k
console?
I know but still
I mean Xenosaga was supposed to have 6-7 games origionally
It got cut in half
Ikr?
The community could pretty much fund the studio to do it i bet haha
It comes in Aliens and Terminator 2 flavour as well.
/me puts out the fires
ouch
Because monkies need more hats.
TOP HAT!
Diving helmet?
Hey everypony
bowler?
how about AJs stetson?
Also, my 4gb of RAM arrived :)
Police helmet?
Well since this is the first thing I ever tried doing I'm going to do something simple
Need to install Counter Strike, Quake 1 2 and 3 and mabye TF2
"Maybe" TF2?
Is it suppose to be the Buffer Show?
http://i.imgur.com/00vkQ.jpg
I can think of good reasons for not installing tf2. Like... i dunno.. sleep.
Sleep is overrated, think of the time you could spend collecting hats.
Sleep? Pfff

Ded.
Hallo Sketch_Toku_Brony~
i neer saw an ad for wow on tv
germany doesnt seem to do that
Though I gotta be honest, the Mists of Pandaria opening cinematic was pretty great. But it ends there.
but they diasppeared wuickly
Facepalm*
*quickly
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HACADr823oU&feature=relmfu
played it myself for a long time. but somehow it doesnt seem to be worht the 13 bucks a month
How's my drawing? http://i47.tinypic.com/35031w6.jpg
anymore
I would rather watch a horrible reenactment of MvM than play WoW
Knife*: beautiful <3
why yes, that is quite the quality drawing there
I thought I would play WoW, but I couldn't come up with enough positive reasons to.
As of Pandaria the debuff reduces Enemy Health and their damage dealt by 35%
You CAN turn it off though
Why would anyone bother though.
There's nothing to gain by turning it off.
Back in my day there was no "noob mode"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3l1oMp-isw
I never upgraded my healing axe in dragonsoul
I always lost the weapon rolls in DS in my raid
Last rogue out of 3 to get the legendaries. By the time they were finished we had DS HC on farm.
And get this, the first one we gave them too buggered off.
Am I lame for never doing a heroic Cata raid?
.....with wizards
*purge
its pretty good,plus the song is catchy :$ "Maji ka Maji da Maji de Showtime~"
I laughed at it :).
yeah, it always bugged me that we had nothing like that
maybe
And everyone knows how annoying that is.
this lack of sound in here is disturbing. here, ahve some music i found last week http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJwo6bMKBaw
neat, like howi twilight's talking in serif and dash in san serif, and pinkie with some odd font
Anyone getting a stream?
no stream my end

Back.
What's going on now?
I didn't care then, and I don't care now. Tragic yes, and I don't choose not to care, I just don't.
Are we talking about 9/11?
This is the first I've heard of it today
Then again I'm in the wrong country
Oh, today is 9/11.......:'(
how do turn that fucking ping off?
i just realized it
In Britain it's 11/9

The train Subway.
With the trains.
13I'll give a word of warning. It is not safe to make 9/11 jokes.
its pretty fucking stupid when people think that since its been 11 years 9/11 jokes are okay...
I think it was Neil.
You managed to get stabbed by Neil? Were you dogging?
Then in that case DO NOT........I repeat DO NOT watch (or re-watch) NC's review of Once Upon a Forest.
Anyway, I would reccomend that we don't talk about 11/9 or 9/11 because around 80% of the interent are dicks and insensitive
AT LEAST NOT TODAY
Anyone want to bet when I get on WoW trade is gonna be full of 9/11 shit?
1/1/2012 Never forget.
http://derpy.me/iUs0o
AGAIN: Do not watch NC's review of Once Upon a Forest........TODAY
NOT TODAY
Once upon a forest?
Which one was that again?
RRRRRRheumatism?
YES

You can get around even a k-line if you care enough but at that point it's kind of just give up because it's not worth it :)
00,10hmmm the A movie is rather long perhaps they should have spent less time trying to not talk about it.

I don't know
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIYGullw4o8 Oh this is brilliant
The only recent thing I heard about Bill Nye were his comments on creationists and how they shouldn't be spreading their stupid to their children.
I was born in Greenland and lives in Denmark too

And when they hatch the larvae eat them from the inside out
2,14 those are wasps, and caterpillars
http://flutterspin.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5edyti are the three
2,14 part of the biological cycle
2,14 but I'm not certain if those wasps lay them in other creatures, or ust the caterpillars
Those wasps just use caterpillars iirc.

13wrek needs to play tribes 2
13or even tribes 1
did any of those goe by the title of vengeance?
He has played Tribes 2.
or was that another tribes?7
13we don't talk about tribes vengeance .-.
lol
13i could torture everyone and play its singleplayer though
I own Tribes Vengence.
only tribes i had xD
The only thing I liked about it was a few videos the "pros" made
The only Tribes I've played is the most recent one, I don't really like it.
13they ruined the gameplay itself though
13but i would steal the disc launcher effects for t2, and of course i use the hitsound in tf2
13(which is http://tf2dingalings.com/sound/details/363 btw)
13chrome autocompletion :3
The default ones are ear drum shattering.
is that planetside 2?
also hi
13the tf2 stock hitsound is awful
pew pew pew
lazahs
Hitsound as in the damage ding?
nvm guns
13ja
Why would you even turn that on?
wat are we watching people...
well you guys are screwed
then i went as a sniper and sniped most everybody's heads of
It looks cool.

wow... THAT is the map?

that's one fucking map, iÄd say
13is it me or are there permanent IFFs
Blaspheme!
13tribes maps are known for being stupidly huge
13it's part of the appeal
I have the damage text for TF2 enabled but not the sound, not like there isn't usually enough ambient noise anyway
13oh
13that explains a lot
xD
13like the permanent IFFs
it does look awfully pretty though
...
They took them out.
bit sterile on the open parts, but acceptable
Half my shit is gone.
...
Well, not all of them.
But I'm missing about half my totems.

hmm.... flight physics seem a bit spongy

You want to know something even more ridiculous.

Why?
Kneejerk reaction.
Besides, at that point he hadn't turned it into "I don't like Fluttershy because she's boring and mean".
Character bashing I just can't stand.
Lol
Plus there's the way he goes about it.
It's self-righteous and arrogant.
"I don't hate FLuttershy, I just think she's the worst and the meanest one to date."

Hey everypony.
I remember 9/11. I was in tech college.
i somewhat expected it
I feel young o.O
I was 2 when 9/11 happened.
I do remember being 3, and I remember living at my old house and all that, but just that day....It's not there.
And I even had a friend of my dad's come back to the house covered in debris.
Killed by: gun
9/11...I have vague memories of that.
http://imgur.com/l9qWh
Okay, I'm back.
man, I totally forgot todays 9/11....
died*
is this still the same match or not?

alrighty then
Tumbling?

08,01so okay

And then we'll be all nice and toasty
and earth goes poof
But it isn't really that. It's more of a random-being-made-to-do-useless-excerises-thing. We get to the actual learning when we're all exhausted.
i'm back everypony
:)
...For whatever reason, that sounded really epic.
"Dissipate into space~"

Was that a tab fail?
It's gonna be like it was on dr.who.
12/21/12: When the Mayans switched to the metric system
It wont be my problem then
Yes, thank you Saturn <3
Billions and billions.
we do that anyway :)
08,01for a sun, that is
08,01under 1000km in diameter
Saturn: and after that one cools off?
Gesündheit.
In other news: Scientists have determined that the Sun is too round
Its quite illuminating
Saturn... you know WAY too much :3
the sun is really hot right now
you mean a umm
08,01Freefall29: i'm not googling it; i used to be an astrophysicist

He traded it for ponies.

Hey Everypony!
I <3 hugs! :3
05:P
/me giggles.
...Hint?
hint of wut?
my hint senses are not tingling
scinec ehas abaondoned us
08,01as it's really just a theoretical phenomena
Anything could happen with it.
I probably wasn't looking at the time.
Wait, correct me if I'm wrong; do we have an engagement on our hands?
I bet the aliens are laughing as our theories right now.
Hold on, what's happening?
Sun talk
i'd also imagine it pretty hard to observe somthing that dowsnt give off any light
08,01look up gravitational lensing
...
-_(\
Dude.
She has a waifu and dat's it.
Saturn: Don't forget neutron stars
08,01Petrified_Discord: our sun is not massive enough to become a neutron star
when we're*
08,01a neutron star is what's left after a supernova
.//////.
Quark stars are best stars
Saturn: Of course, i meant observed phenomena
saturn~
Why...just...why
hey babe <3
*ad
I try not to bet on things like that.
Saturn they have? I thought it was theory based on disapearance of light.
08,01a neutron star is actually pretty cool
BRONYFUNDS
Neutron stars are made of neutrons
I just hope they're alright when it does.
Saturn, it's awesome
havent seen you in a while, have i Saturn?
:)
you know saturn
you are talking Billions to Trillions of years into the future :)
08,01Dark_Horst: well, mostly neutrons
08,01very, very dense
...
Huh, where'd he go?
I had the most awesome ryme to remember the planets..I forgot it....:(
About the size of Manhatten
I know I'm gonna get alot of flak for this but this looks like a suped up version of Halo..to me anyway
There are no quark stars.
3 to 4 guys lost conenction at the same time
actually
Did the Rarity server die?
Anyway, figures his first reaction is to bet on how long before it crashes.
His second reaction, however, I can understand.
Connection to IRC scrambled.
By the time you get enough mass to form a quark star, the star('s core) collapses the rest of the way.
08,01see, light doesn't have a mass
08,01but it *does* have a momentum
I'm sure they're mature enough to deal with it like adults, however.
Wait...scratch that.
05isnt light jsut radiation?
long distance or they live close ? uhmm dunno i should't be asking in the first place
And I don't think quark degeneracy exists.
enter*
Adults don't always even deal with that well.
Bleh
08,01Wrek: radiation is one way to describe light, yes
Or is that just a burned out star.
Anyway, even if there's drama we probably won't be privy to it.
http://bit.ly/Ooytpj -- something like this?
08,01it's a propogating wave of electromagnetic flux
08,01but it's also quantised and behaves like a particle
Watch from the sidelines.
With popcorn?
It's a wave and a particle
let me find a bigger one
Saturn I was just asking.
Saturn.
08,01Reikim: <3
Unfortunately? I agree.
basically, light moves in waves that consist of photons. tiny packages of concentrated waves. Saturn, stop me wehn i'm talking bullshit
inb4 bill nye song
Not the time T.

Wow.
I just realized the potential for drama here.
Saturn: that reminds me, some researchers, at an indian university, i think, managed to buid a highspeed camera that is fast enough to capture moving light
i'll excuse myself of this convo, not my business
:)
Saturn: saw the vid about that?
08,01you still see diffraction fringes
We're just worrying about friends here.
08,01which i think is awesome
08,01Dark_Horst: i've read about it

hm...

isnt that young experiment the part where quantum physics come in?
lols
Nothing we can do about it.

No he- screw it, let's be honest here, he's going to lap me while making a rude gesture out the window.
Is Saturn learning physics now?

more like waving at you i'm no one for rude gestures unless deserved

Hey guys
2,14 well, I'm not particular to talking behind people's backs
2,14 but if he ever breaks the rules when I'm watching, I'll take the appropriate action
00,10seems that the checking I was doing on the animations they have that I though had crashed had not crashed fully
after all the gen 3.5 shown here i just dont mind anymore
He doesn't break rules, just talks too much when he shouldn't.
00,10so you are saying we need to go to gen 3.6?
2,14 unfortunately, that's a very fine line to tread
...
2,14 technically, it's not against the rules unless he starts goint too far
2,14 ask, and ye shall receive
inb4 i regret this
:D
lol wut :D
2,14 is to PM a mod, don't confront the person
that is one long house

Well, perhaps the caffiene and other chemicals amplify the effects.
00,02Klumzeedragon, i think onions have a great texture, to each their own i supose
Yeah. :) Exactly. Not gonna bash anyone for opinions.
Too much chocolate for me and milk starts feeling really good. Same with too much milk. Chocolate becomes refreshing.

Crayon Vision~
I've been reading through Problem Sleuth lately.
Never mind. I thought the Frieza saga was split between Season 2 and 3. I was wrong about that. There are videos that have Season 1 and 2 together and run for multiple hours
eenope
He DID whaaat? :O
hm...
:)
ah...chat was a stupid idea...gtg...have fun :)
She's pretty much a genious above Twilight's level.
She just can't express it.
But she doesn't have a seeing problem, she's just being efficient in her field of view
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRFecBw1DaQ
That is by far the most adorable thing I've seen today.
But I did fabulously. :p
You diiiid. :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDgk2YMzGpY Here you go. More adorableness.
08,01this is the most awesomely accurate description of ADD i've seen: http://xkcd.com/1106/
Hallow!
Hello Saturn! And yeah, that's relly adorable :3
Saturn, I agree.
Focusing on one thing while you should be looking at the entire picture.
xD That's silly.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H40wUz-Fd8&feature=player_detailpage
This is sooo Un-Rainbow. D:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcGHpy5Z3kE
Oh come on, I need to Dash! D:
that awkward moment when 5 minutes later you realise its looping
I need to sleep, that's like the opposite of a Rainbow.
Rainbow sleeps a lot. :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f0kPcxBx0E Piano cover is 20% cooler
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: i feel like shit! woo!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQjiX5KI9WE
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: but seriously, i've been up for about 24 hours straight now
08,01again
08,01i should stop doing this
nonsense, Saturn. You're having fun!
08,01Ninjazz: i feel simultaneously hot and cold, and i want to puke my guts out
only Pegasi can sleep on clouds. D:
08,01MadSurge: not for another few hours; i have meetings
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwe0daWswqc&feature=my_liked_videos&list=LLH5u48Qgmlwz6VInDtA1D3g
Saturn, I'd imagine a few people would buy expensice medication to get that feeling.
08,01but i tried that last night
expensive*
But I'm not a Pegasi. :(
08,01turns out that in reality, clouds are really just noisey, hard, and unforgiving machines
Ouch.
Saturn: get a mountain of fluff and sleep on it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVZGNO0VVTA&feature=player_detailpage
Don't you delegate responsibilities?
Saturn: Is there anything I can do to serve you my lord?
No wing or horns...just a plain old horse that can speak.
I do...only Earth pony that seems content is Pinkie Pie.
/me sighs
Hahaha are we discussing earth ponies? Thought noone had them as OC :D
here's an add http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxy9mrKplzA
Enrol Now!
good*
08,01applejack and rainbow dash would make adroable babies with each other
08,01and before anyone questions it: magic.
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: actually, unicorns sleep upside-down in trees, like bats
Lies! Unicorns sleep like possums, not bats!
striped*
08,01MadSurge: i'd think that the rainbow mane and tail is a genetic mutation, one that could potentially be passed down
:D
08,01though child colour seems to be somewhat random
Inded
*indeed
08,01though you don't see many, well, any, rainbow maned ponies around
A stylish one.
08,01or a very rare one that requires 2 carriers in order for the trait to be expressed
08,01Ninjazz: how do possums sleep
Hey saturn how did it go on the train?
Saturn, upside down on trees, hanging from their tails.
08,01nice
08,01i did not know that
Saturn: :O
The more you know! ~*
hmmm cool
The shocking truth.
08,01Moopy: it went fine, actually; i got to the airport 10 minutes before check-in closed, but i managed to make it to my plane
thats good to hear
Did you get something to eat?
08,01not until i was back home, no
08,01i had no euros left
heh euros
Grrrr.
Disconnect.
well, I dont sleep upside-down
08,01it's a bugger that i won't see him again until January
08,01then another few months away
08,01then i graduate, and if we're still going strong, we might move in together
hey is there no streem
08,01Klumzeedragon: he lives in the netherlands, i live in scotland
08,01and i'm studying currently
08,01Klumzeedragon: i told myself i'd never do one again
08,01but this has a definite and quite near end to the long distance part
Saturn, I do certainly hope things work out this time.
I just gave up on having any form of relationship awhile ago
