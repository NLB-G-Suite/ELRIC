00,10I pop my neck like that all the time.
This is bollywood. Musical numbers dont HAVE to make sense.
that cop is just too awesome
I should give the cop a tag
One must admit, though-- in the area of pure unlimited random escapism, India has it down pat.
how can that happen
bollywood pony episode-make it happen
tag for "the face" guys?
Er, except it does make sense. >_>

Imagine seeing this live as a musical. That would be bomb.

I guess they prefer quantity over quality
Try really good
I prefer Linsanity over tebowmania atleast
Maybe a string of 3-4 in a row.
The thing is.... since most Bollywood is pure escapism, for the masses (Al la Depression America, which did a lot of the same things) the musicals numbers do happen at random. The American equivalent was the musical, where instead of being random, they were a constant, even the whole focus of the picture.
Bunty Aur Babli
