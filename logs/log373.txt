Shizuka Yes, I got it a few days ago
Big_Jakeintosh: pretty much. films in india are meant to be day-long experiences, and encapsulate as many styles and genres as possible.
this is so weird
It's not LATE in the Netherlands, of course.
If you win a movie pick it makes no sense not to watch it.
Fun fact: The voices are dubbed. Almost no Bollywod actors sing their own songs
13Sumica: singing... but not going
WHO'S IDEA WAS THIS?
TOY_PON3: yh, your telling me

Byeeee
If I win B movie I'll be there just for the chat reaction to everything about it.
Another good song is Bolo Ta Ra Ra- by Daler Mehendi

derp, requesting twilight would put you in the exception area of "love and tolerate" a scary place, where pinkie promises are broken
oh thank GOD it's over
well guys I'm gonna go play skyrim if I dont come back tonight I will talk to you guys in the morning :)
Don't worry, I bet we'll get a new song in about 5 minutes.

rupees is currency in india
I voted North By North West for A and Reefer Madness for B
Forty Rupees!
he's a plumber???
Ah, I knew about WMC, but I was curious. I expect should someone choose that they'd be run out with pitchforks
Meanwhile: bad actors, I worked with Indians for 3 years, they were MUCH more entertaining than this
TOY_PON3 O_O.......................................Maybe
Mine is Troll Hunter
for B
why does he have a wrench?
StinkomanFan: you have good taste in music
Suddenly a suited man appears!
All I can think about is butter chicken and popadoms. Does that make me a bad person?
movies*
dammit!
You have found twenty ruppes dont spend it all in one place
They told me I could become anything, so I became a bollywood dancer.
profits!
13to date the only movies to earn that distinction are Babes in Toyland and Epic Movie
Isn't GP a recognized currency in JPN banks because of Dragon Quest?
im not following it
otakon : DO IT!
Thank you
Imma troll everybody by picking the newest pokemon movie. Everybody will be "Where's Brock?" and "Bullshit, that's not a pokemon"
This is skipping really badly on my end
Randomnerd: already done
Easy way to earn Rupees in india: 1. Get sword, 2. Cut random grass and bushes, 3. Random Rupee falls out, 4. PROFIT!
There's more than one pokemon movie?

Why does this movie make me think of Naploean Dynamite?
to all: Harsh.
IshBestPony: WHY!?

too far
*pleased*
okay this isn't worst movie material but this is really boring
JERK Son

it's bad in a absolutely horrible pointless MAKES NO SENSE WAY
This movie isn't bad at all...
I like vinyl. It has a warmth to its sound that cannot be easily produced with digital media.
00,10it's rarity

And that Pig's Tale movie
I mean, how can you not laugh at Wiseau's performance?
you mean dj pon-3

I've seen the room on adult swim once, it... was interesting
It is not good to talk to oneself
/me cringes at Babes in Toyland
Did I hear "Chopey Lotey"?
Oh great, lead female is a narcissistic tool. Spelling optional.
*once
Dken2021: Same here it was an April Fool's joke
RAWRity: bc it gave me an aneurism in the Nostalgia Critic review
She is hindu and said dear god :3
Insanity is repetition
Secsi~
:D
It's a bindi, something to do with Hinduism apparently
otakon: if you go into it expecting a good movie, you won't enjoy it. go into it expecting amateurish horse shit, then you will love every minute of it.
pony_2312 says you.
I heard english
The Critic kind of did a poor job on it IMO
over acting
all 6 ponies are tilting their heads in confusion and fluttershy is scared
Yup, definetly rarity.

Abusive father is best father

Bring back Top Secret.

Thanks :) *takes a couple and eats it* ...mmmm its good :)
13alice was bad but we had fun with it
flutterwacken*
"forget all your hopes and dreams (the stuff tat make you happy) i want you to be happy!" seems legit

This is pretty good so far actually, they're building up characters at least.
Needs more butter for the popcorn
00,10brb geting ranch popcorn.

Tovler: He said it was so bat id was good.
13epic movie was just offensive, crude, not funny
she's doomed
"forget your dreams" is the word in traditional cultures

crunch crunch it's so buttery.
Babes in Toyland is amusing for about ten seconds because of 18 year old Keanu Reeves.
SONG?
Song tiem.
Epic wasn't the worst, but that's only because I saw Meet the Spartans
I also have a soda~
TOY_PON3 i want my flutterwacken
O___________________O
augg, now you made me hungry
Worst Movie Clause has only been given to two movies. Its hard to declare on a movie

No Gumri, it's srs
13about five minutes in we were discussing the probability of WMC, cause *no one* was having fun with it
it has to be REALLY BAD
Oh good
I want tea
inb4 they both fall in love
/me cringes at Babes in Toyland again

All Seltzer and Friedburg films are worst movie
Meet the Spartans is twice as bad as Epic Movie
Soda is bad for you....drink water taht tastes like grapes
Tovler meet the spartens i found funny
Although dari Liked epic movie XD

Liberal arts and pure science is somewhat harder to apply to life, but they're doing well in those fields too.

@CriticKitten I agree. It's pretty cool dance style.

and then suddenly serious
let me just I love your videos
It's true.....India has honestly surpassed Western culture in terms of good musical choreography and dance. They make such fantastic work these days that anyone who isn't cultured in Bollywood yet really SHOULD get cultured in it.

SHE LICKED HIS NIPPLE
I agree with those saying this is actually ahead of Western cinema in terms of incorporating music and song.
Where are they supposed to be? they drove up a mountain to have sex in some dusty ruins?

Damn it Murdock!

@sumica - that probably makes more sense to the plot than the plot itself
That sucks...

It's pretty clear and concise, you'd have to just not be paying attention to miss it.

I taking you off the case!
StinkomanFan: then you should know better!
Is he a pilot?
Game Design is actually considered an easy Major around here, but A LOT of people apply for it.
I'm used to the horrors
The wayc this is cut together...it makes them seem like they're talking to a wall
CS @ RIT is actually VERY vicious.

I honestly wished I took up game programming or CS instead of CPE. CPE is not only not well recognized; it is actually fairly saturated.
RIT is always that collge someone has heard about, but never really knowns anything about.

Well, I was at a factory until I got a Web dev position this week.

Yeah. I didn't get anywhere with the degree myself
right now I'm a web programmer - for a light switch company.
Had to take up teaching and get a Masters.
Exciting, huh?
I want to buyt it is hard
Meanwhile: stop being mean to everypony
Computer Programming. Frustrating work it is.
jopb is a job
Not being mean, being honest.
flutter_spin: it not neccessary the programming aspect, it's the design.
Cudly: I make more money with Hands on CLients. No degree or anything : /
I rather be a chef.
I know he hurt your feelings but as a wise man once said "Let he without sin cast the first stone"
Good news is, though, I could always go back for a second Masters in engineering if I want to. Once I have money.
What language?
But it is cool

bollywood movies, by their very nature, are the kind of thing you have to know what you're getting into. If you don't prep yourself for 3 hours of genre hopping cheesiness, you won't enjoy yourself.
0,14it is an AMAZING sight
This'd be easier to play of as my nature if I could control the tone of words.
what
Fine luna, if you wont i will just have to take care of this myself D:<
dawwww, yes you can have hugs fluttershy
It is.
It would be cool

Lulz - 2 years.

RAWRity: I don't enjoy cheesyness, it hurts me physically
CuddlyKittens11 If there's any Indian Dancing, they totally need to introduce a new "race" of creatures. Do it with Indian Elephants! :D
RAWRity: I think it's great, but the lenght is killing me.
Indians have good taste
i guess im going to sleep

CriticKitten:*insert Rarity whining rant here*
Someone spiked my drink
WE NEED AN INTERMISSION
And?
If you can't enjoy it when it's clearly not a bad movie, then go do something else instead of whine. We've watched stuff *I* didn't like and I didn't waste time whining about it. :p
they should hand out balloons at all bars!
This movie's been running pretty long, hasn't it?
So what are we watching right now anyway?
Better watch it. He may start speaking English being so drunk like that.
It is almost 3/4 over
How much longer we got
fluttercry: this is the only room Bacon was in
Considering it's Bollywood, I shouldn't be surprised if it's really long.
and where did he go?
whoes winnning
this is way better than epic movie
If im ever chosen, im picking back to the barnyard....
CriticKitten: no i like it kind of but its really really long
All bollywood movies are long
This must be how dari feels when people call his movie opinions trolling. Must be an English thing.
waaaaait for it
True

Linsanity is never over.

I guess the british are just really shit at sarcasm.
Lin to Win
Not so long as there are puns left in the world.
what the fuck is this?!
I guess they prefer quantity over quality
what movie is this?
Try really good
I prefer Linsanity over tebowmania atleast
SaxyPretender I don't think one defeat is enough to end Linsanity.

if nobody gets your sarcasm, you're doing it wrong.
What a twist~
wait
They had to pay people to clear out, so they could reduce the muber of indians on screen at a time! :D
lol

TheMaster As I've said before, since Indian movies are basically an escape for the lower class, you want to make them pretty long.

he's a COP?
RAWRity: it's rather hard to do sarcasm in text without ending a sentence with /sarcasm.
Mission impossble
i like baloons
yh
small cars
Besides, most of what I said wasn't sarcastic.
/me shakes his head at the people defending this movie from xenophobic uncultured swine.
"ballons are super easy to pack" - pinkie pie
Did he just drive off in a golf cart?

she's PREGNANT too?
Heart shaped ballons-- you sure no pony is around? (Looking at YOU,. Pinkie!)
No, Luna genuinely enjoys this, and I can understand why. It's an acquired taste, but if you're open to it, it can be a ton of fun.
golf cart is pretty swag over there
00,03there*
Why does that sign in the backround make me think DDR?

Luna is best pony
otakon: there's "not enjoying it" and then there's "acting live everyone who is enjoying it is insane or trolling." essentially, you've become that kid in the red jacket from Teens React To Bronies.
I don't know why
/me uses his other hoof to rub Princess_Luna's back the way she likes
How did they burn so much money so quickly?
CriticKitten Speaking of getting some cultures from films and whatnot, Nigeria's film industry is starting to boom as well.
Princess_Luna: you do what is it?
with fire
A party
/me checks his apple pies are fresh and ready to fling
Saddly, I haven't seen any Nigerian films yet.

Alright, I want ponies really bad right now :3
Wow that was a bit much TechRat, hello...thank you all and slow down for a second...
Easy, they have help from the joker to burn all the money
RAWRity: dear god NO! I don't want to be that guy!
Nollywood? I haven't heard any good things about them to be honest.
Ouch
Harsh. But accurate.
/me Shoots a dart in fillyfillyy's neck filled with a knockout poison
its india they spent it on cheap labor
:)
Now imagine this... acted by ponies
How will they burn all that gold
lol
I REALLY don't want to be that guy, HOW DO I STOP IT!
RAWRity: In otakon's definse, I suggested Luna was trolling, not he.
/me is wearing royal armour
Is this the end of the movie?
Aye, and honestly the more experience you get with other cultural films, the better. You'll be able to enjoy things in a whole new light.
HE JUST FLIPED US OFF!
Luna probably is trolling,.
05,15RAWRity that kid was an asshat
DerpDERPDERPDERP From what I've read, the production costs are pretty low so far. But hey, you've got to start out somewhere.
/me tosses the pie at Thetrollside
Do you like the armour fillyfillyy?
He got dressed in 10 seconds flat
Since Luna isn't even here.
I just don't get the appeal of this is all
Can you even move in that, fillyfillyy ?
/me has Thetrollside taken away to the dungean for assasination attempt
Caution Passengers: Do not look at yourself in the mirror
/me now picks Fiddler on the Roof for A movie.
i want that uniform
You are so tiny. Is funny to me.
Princess_Luna: what is the name of your website?
otakon: simple. Stop bring others into it. YOu have a problem with the film? say it. But don't assume that because you aren't getting anything out of it that others can't.
Just because of the pure mass of Nollywood filmmakers, one or two of them is bound to get some major hits.
/me Launches rocks at fillyfillyy
Prediction. He's gonna catch them, and then he's gonna let them go.

05,15I liked it
Pretty good film, it was just way too long.

korean rap is awesome
i rate it OVER 9000
Entertaining, but far from the best Bollywood movies I've seen
India. You get your money's worth-- LONG movies, lots of random dancing, and.. other stuff... that makes you happy.
ITS BUNTY
but it's just TOO DAMN LONG
I can't tell if this is the actor rapping or a dub.
But for now I've got to go to bed
He's not rapping, the guy
And this, folks, is what Indian strippers look like.
Okay this is the one redeeming factor

is it wrong that i find pinkie promise more memorable from this ep than derpy?
chimicherry
It's the Janet Jackson thing all over again when only 90 people were actually offended.
or cherrychang
she's a "working girl"
she is more like a madam
RainbowcrashNBurn: hell no

yellow cherries?
mmm yellow cherries
good LORD
hey they look familliar
Pinkie needs to shut her mouth and never open it again.
I switch to a different tab for 30 seconds and this scene already comes up
This is an excellent ep, but this scene is relatively overrated.
oh i love this I love lucy pony style
LAWDY
Yes there are Yellow Cherries IRL
they are NOT perfect
sounds delicious
that factory is not very efficient
Yes. There rea yellow cherries.
well, she's always been rather stretchy physically
Applejacks not lying per say, shes just not telling anyone about anything.
OMG i just checked itunes...why did they take down this ep?? :(
dat freez
yeah
Well, it would be if it weren't for Derpy, actually. XD
boink
they should put 1 color at the end of the conveyor and push the other color in the box

but I mean thats a bit of a stretch in my eyes

When Apple removes a show from iTunes, they more or less DELETE it from the servers. Hasbro may not KNOW this.
