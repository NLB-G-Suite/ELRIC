Uh-oh, sensing incoming bipedal pony. I HATE bipedal ponies.
:O GASP!
lile LittemissJay? Great faces, but dat bipedal all over
hey guys , hadnt been here in a while
Bipedalism leads inevitably to weird anthropomorphic horse people.
for bipedal pony: http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/244/d/4/when_no_one_is_watching_by_tamalesyatole-d5d5awh.gif
Sorry.
>.>
I think bipedalism often looks anthro even if it still has all the feral traits
See, a horse's legs aren't built for bipedalism. The main leg is up where a human's thigh would be.
They turn into these creepy, ungainly aliens with reverse jointed knees.
yeah
they can rear up and look cool, but it looks odd when they walk
05enjoy!
05you are now enjoyign MAd caddies live!
(slightly modified quote from the tutorial I followed when I was making terrible attempts to draw)
05tablet
I am very fond of horselegs, like the way they look
bye guys
A lot of people don't seem to understand how a horse's anatomy works.
but I haven't studied the inner workings enough to say how it should look when they do rear up and try to walk
:(
ok, if anythin comes up lemme know
Oh 16...
i feel like the world is coming down on me
apparently a tablet
cause it seems like he have drawn this beforehand and is just showing off xD Its too good
he uses a tablet for sai
Yeah i do too , but i suck.
I agree with mad
thanks guys
:)
That doesn't look like a Shadaloo insignia....
derpy?
is that derpy?
Applejack
hahaha as soon as the blonde hair was drawn lol xD

whats anthro?
exactly
Though I do think the USA neads more liberal and socialist policies and less Republican Neo-conservatism and oligarchic money controll of washington.
aniam;s on two feet
:P
ferrel is on all fours
WHEEEEEE PLOTICS!
/me lives in a socialistic democracy

BRB gonna get some tea
just sayin
hehe
we have six political parties, all ranging from left to right and middle- I don't know shit about it, and don't care as long as my country works
the only thing I want is free dentistry
/me is sick of expensive dentist bills
/me has free health care :3
wut?
both parties are socially behind...republicans try to restore the 50s
DA-DA-DA-DAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
democrats the 70s
i like the 50s :)
we pay 25% taxes I think
Debating politics, I see. I'll make the popcorn.
is 25% much compared to USA?
well thats just MVA
oh look, Winona
nope.avi
:D
I can't really engage in the debate since I don't know american politics at all
fluttershy
Kanarihu- No, the mainstream media would want me to belive that the Democrats are liberal inorder for them to get more votes.
i find trolls adorable :3
trolls don't exist anymore
whats a hoov?
:D
SOCIALISM?
IN MY MURIKA?
this is the land of the free
superior feeling feels good
haters gonna hate
I have no opinions on Fox other than the joke ones from Sipmsons
alright at the end or beginnign
/me is teaching
darling, yup
*beginning
what's wrong with CNN?
they baised
Never seen CNN either
name one that is not biased
it's just the propaganda bullshit of a different pressure group
I hated s19, but kinda liked s20- haven't seen the newest yet
that close up is just...........awkward
MSNBC and FOX are much more biased than CNN, CNN isnt pretty well balanced, just insiped and boring.
:P
yeah-
He's getting jaded-
I didn't like that 500th episode
that season was pretty good-
has anyonehas much success selling on pnysquyare.com or ibrony?
Hi everypony

okay
Groening*
hahais there like a link to this stream
hm, I understood it differently from the commentary tracks-
00,10sounds like some deus ex
cool music
*confession bear* i dont really like dues ex that much....
/me hugs Pinkie
Hi, everypony!
in fact i still am
EY everypony
Hm
hi pony
after 500 episodes, they have to run out of material eventually. the only thing keeping them running is pop culture references
the show had a sort of--real feeling, you know? Gritty- poor, etc
:)
but as seasons progressed "Lets go to alaska" "k" and it just spiraled, and now its all about the joke
it might- but IF it does, hopefully after many great seasons
maybe~~ sometimes they're slow
The thing tht iks me about some people in the USA, is that some people seem to put the founding fathers on pedistools and worship them as if they had no faults or held posistions that disagree with them. Personally I have a lot of critisisms about them, like the morality of propergating a violent rebellion to achive their political views.
wasnt there some rumors of south park doing a bronie episode?
thank you
i think it is
probably
orly?
05america is the modern day roman empire
