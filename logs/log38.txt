Lols
Um
It's just a place for like-minded people to gather and talk, there isn't a set subject.
Hello Shaico
>.>
like the current TV show
Nick would be Rarity?
03there
03now it's just blocked
03not censored
LOL
03:P
http://youtu.be/Iz9GUIwzCIw - Let's Play StarTropics 01: C-Island
Twilight is Zoey?
Just happened
Nah Nick would be Twilight
I didn't even say "m!p"
Sarcastic, Naive
lmfao
Yeah
Nick = Twilight
03apparently you did
03o.o
No I didn't?
03OMG IT'S A CONSPIRACY
03YOUR IPOD LIKES THAT SHOW TOO
OMG no it isn't
03AND IS AUTOCORRECTING TO IT
I mean Coach
...
I just realized that this song fits pinkie pie
No it didn't
03so that you don't realize it
03:P
idk why, they just have likable personalities
Please do not swear. You have sworn 2 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
Rochelle and Coach suck
03:P
I typed NOTHING OF THE F***ING SORT
.
Seems like the most fitting
.............
03yeah
Fa
Fail
03thjose like 6 lines came in at once
03I know it's fail

:)
Ever hear of majority rules)
*?
03I did
03why
lol
No way
:P
Trixie = Rochelle
Rarity is too good for Rochelle
We are using main characters
uhh
Rochelle is kinda bland
Rochelle should be a background pony
Same with you and other people when some other people like some of Gen 5.
:P
03LOL
Derpy?
03anyway
Main characters guys
03not to mention
Come on
no Rochelle has no character
He is faster to type than She

By a letter yes xD
it can't be decided
03I need to go
She?
K
Cya.

There are many definitions of immortality. for example, you can live as long as the universe last... or you can make sure the universe only lasts as long as you do

Suddenly*
YOu just said florida sucks....
I read the book when I was little
Florida sucks
But you like Miami Heat?

Miami Heat doesn't
Florida is ok

Oh okay then
._.
I was one of the penguins

I can do this then
I can't believe they fucking lost to Mavericks.
MAVERICKS
aww haha
lol
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT
I think we have pictures of me
If I were to have to chose any one state to send a nuke to, it would have to be Florida though.

Florida is very interesting.

That's a nice everything you got there.
Anyone take Nukes seriously though? Ever?

CLICK IT
/me RUNS
And I don't care
I take nukes seriously when you are talking about them seriously.
BECAUSE MAVERICKS WOOOO
Okay back to nukes
/me swears revenge on all dolphins and whales

no.
Woooo! Spring Break.
Haha

KOREAN WOOWOWOWOWOW
Lets talk about Nukes seriously and see where it heads.
Thanks
/me also get's the reference
anyway I should sleep
bye
I don't - they would have at least tested one if they did
they do and don't
LOL
/me and is lol'ing that he got the reference.
Well, I personally respect nukes in the "The Stand" scenario.
but they are close
(probably)
I loved The Stand.
israel has some borrowed from the states.
and its bombing only.
Some say they worked with South Africa on nukes
Also, on that page.
South Africa did have 6 at one point.
Scroll down a bit.
Look at the first few images.
lmfao
You'll probably know when you see it.
How do you borrow a nuke?
although that was 10 years ago. the might now own their own.
/me has been to South Africa before
North Korea has a few, only a few, nukes now
And then I said "Let my people go."
YES hahahahhah!
I got McDonalds to deliver some food to me!
hurhurhur
how?
i called them
and asked for a delivery
israel has 80 apparently...
They got delivery over where I am
and they are their own
Oh I agree
Well ponies i gotta get goin'
<3 IRC
We need to kill North Korea
SEE YA TOMORROW
gonna finally finish L.A. Noire
BADLy
and yes
KILL COREA :D
No
By we I mean everyone
no
Hit it with a stick!
Seriously, we are techincally still at war with them.
HIT IT WITH A CROWBAR™
LOL
Pinata
Also on that page: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0HZhM_CrSg
Interesting.
And south korea NEVER even signed an armistice
spanish keyboards only

ñññ
ÑÑÑÑÑÑÑ
hahhahah.
you mad
That'll never happen. lol
Ñ
hay guise
but I remember them being SLOW
Mac keyboards have easy non-English character access
do alt codes work here
yes Θ
Simply AWFUL~
I just imagined Rarity as a software designer
How to kill north korea, discuss
[zZz]ekeS, no. Java based, flashed based and other nonsense based plugins are terrible terrible things.
I cannot get my mind to wrap around rarity designing software
Fine...
They have memory leaks incredibly impressive for a plaintext based application.
regedit
+rarity
Thread by thread, coding it together
/me fails at code
Also that actually works
Lol

When does the garbageman come?
without people thinking its strange for me
My parents still cant' believe I watch 'a show for little girls' They're fooling themselves if they think that's all it is.
18 weeks
:O
XD
If he hasn't come yet, the trash can probably hasn;t been emptied yet
idk
and that reminds me
Everyone thinks that about us
Garbage man comes in the afternoon when I was out @ wal mart
/me can beat intermediate mode in 10 seconds flat.
?
huh
no
#bronies
he's been there all day
Oh, no, he turned up here sometime.
I said "hey", but he left immediately.
huh, weird

NETSPLITS ~

Hurray! Netsplits

and I'm getting sick again
At least you'll get to see them though
oh no
D:
I fucking fuck fuck bullshit drug bag fuck
ugh
I was sick two weeks ago
for a whole week
6PRINCE ALI! FABULOUS HE! ALI ABABWA!

heh, yeah, that would suck

gah

D:
but but
:(
seattle crowds are fucking wild no matter where I go
i guess you havnt noticed me at all then haha
6If you're going to use the name, expect to be called one.
ha, I can beleive it
6I noticed you right away.
6You've been nickchanging all day.
ok then :(
D:
xDD
I'd be terrified in a place like that
I get nervous in malls...
...XD really?
hmm
I'm not good with people
yes
or crowds I should say
where I grew up there's no such thing as a crowd
ever
yessir i have been enjoying it ever since
are YOU gonna stream next week? :D
We had 2 wall of deaths when my friend was playing with his band somewhere.
6I'll likely do Saturday, I think.
there was only one show that they didn't do it at and I think it was because it wasn't very crowded
nasjdgkasg
ill be there
ahaha
well then..today and yesterday was fun
ill see you next week :D
XD
6Of course.
cya~
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYDrb7cJhOI

D: that looks scary as ****
Lawl, it's fun.
XD dari is hardcore
Haha, hardly. XD
:P
yeahh
aiden is the only band I usually see that does wod's though
MY DREAM IS TO CROWDSURF ONE DAY
/shot
Hahaha. XD That'd be cool.
when I saw snowing a week or two ago
there's no stage no barrier
and I got shoved right into the singer dude
hullo
LOL. XD
/me pokes Aristeo's channel again!
I had to move I was worried that if I kept getting pushed into them I'd fuck up their sound or equipment
;o
o.o
I have a pic on my cellphone one minute I'll link it
it's like just the dude's head
and nothing else

Wow, that's pretty close. XD
:d
:3
yes that was crazy
that was a really cool venue too
it was like
just a basement
lol
I swear someone that worked there lives there
I've seen one totally underground venue.
That was pretty cool.
when I filmed for algernon cadwallader after snowing's set I was in the back standing on the back of a couch leaning against a mattress
and there were like bike parts scattered all over the place and before the venue they were serving homemade tacos or w/e
;o
Lol, wth.
4SIRSPRINKLES!
http://www.last.fm/music/Algernon+Cadwallader/+images/41850837
:o
Filming must be difficult.
depends on the venue and the people
fuck
Looks fun though.
I don't usually film every show I go to
I hate when I leave my scrollback up
._.
like a few hours
lmao
other than that it's just random whether I decide to or not
grabbing and strumming are entirely different levels of articulation though
They're still selling it too
but it is interesting to think about
http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/452/Battle+Isle+2.html
strumming would be easier for the pony
theoretically
Children of Bodom.
Looks great but I'm not buying
12don't stare at me D:
I guess strumming wouldn't be that hard.. managing the frets though? I guess no harder then on cello
/me stares
no, easier
.-.
because you wouldn't have to be as precise with the fingerings
cello and other non-fretted instruments require you to be RIGHT on the point in order to produce the in-tune note
makes sense
hmm
I listen to a lot of different things but that's not really my area
Rage Against The Machine, or Bullet For My Valentine?
Thanks for the aid :)
Fuck OC
nahh
;_;
good evening, equestria
evenin
konbanwa
these are my jams :P http://www.last.fm/user/Mikehsaur/library
just listened to the npr thingy
blarg
....
not angry, just annoyed that its once again the MOM'S BASEMENT jokes
Yep, NPR bashing
That's how it is with all things internet-related
meh, haters gonna hate
But it was probably a local affiliate
fyck i know dapples
Anything ever. *shrug*
6Yes?
I actually listen to npr more than any radio station, and i've always liked wait wait
4Sup?
Looked that way from the transcript AgnitioExMachina
6Not much
yep
or for alphabetical order http://www.last.fm/user/Mikehsaur/library?sortBy=name#p1
4Cool
Ok, thanks.
It's either homophobia, reactionist THEY MUST BE PEODS, Moms basement jokes, Unemployment joke.
4So how do you think the stream went?
dapples, relax, it's some local retards doing an opinion section
Yep
4Earlier today, I mean
same
but I like tons of other music too
the unemplyment thing bothered me actually. I don't think I was tempted to quit my job to obsess over anything
exactly haha
Real NPR reporters actually know that there are more bizarre things that isn't worth bashing
/me spies ponies on Mikey's page.
6It was about as bad as after I had fixed it last time.
Nightbooomfer: it was a netsplit not worries
4Man
i'm not deeply offended or anything
yep
you have pony music?
I'm more worried about the comments section about the NPR thing.
awesome!
Fon Shaolin's back. -.-
4Hey, it's Turni
6SUDDENLY TURNIBRONY OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE!
its just obnoxious when things you like cross and one has to say something about the other
XD
Allways.
/me jane316
4So, Turni, do I dare ask if you're finally satisfied with how we run the BMN?
i was talking to a friend recently about how ridiculous is it that girls can like transformers but guys can't like ponies
Do you?
Nightboomfer NPR radio
no one's hating on us, just the usual durr hurr nerds thing
I have no gender identification issues
*shrug*
whoa whoa.. npr thing.. crazy... must go find
I'm actually a pretty good example of a man liking a cutesy show
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/npr-bronies-and-great-and-powerful.html
/me is secure
I never really had a problem. Just had a problem with some of the movies. :P
6XD
I'm pretty confident I'm a woman, but I'm not girly by any means, and I'm secure in that too.
4Well, I'm glad that everybody is finally happy...to an extent
Music you have in common includes MANSIONS, Aiden, Circa Survive, Anarbor and The Swellers.
my fiancee teases me about it, but she doesn't really care
Actually went out and bought Starship Troopers afterwards because I really liked it.
I saw the swellers a month or two ago with bayside
My girlfriend is okay with the idea
I am gradually converting my friends to pony
Woah, cool
...in fact I've seen all listed bands live
ahahah
I think I only have one song of theirs
F*ck stereotypical gender.
I weight train fyi
lol
Srsly.
4I have to say, I was thoroughly entertained the entire time I watched it and I hate Sci-Fi/Action combinations
How's the saying go? "Love and tolerate the sh*t outta them."
I actually want to wegith train
I'm sick of my damn gut
It's always tought, boomfer
i'm trying. its very tough
tough*
But that's the point, kinda.
Weight training only increases metabolism
aerobic exercise burns calories
Negativity is more work
also, cardio is necessary
All i ever do is run
6I could see B-movie due to some of the acting, not much else.
No shit cardio is neccessary lol
for exercise
I do the bodybuildling method of weight trainging
yea
The show has actually helped me evaluate how I see my friends and now I really do try to see the good in everything
is running alone okay for exercise?
:)
MANLY FUCKING SQUATS
SQUATSSS
lol
Boomfer: I think that's awesome.
HHHNNNNNGGGG
Agnitio: LOL\
and like, I have to crall up after a good session
Urgh, exercise.
And last time I checked. The "B" in B-Movie didn't stand for "blockbuster with a million dollar budget" :P
for real
*crawl
Since I am in the middle of nowhere
4JOHNNY I'M DYING
I just eat healthy and walk everywhere, that's my exercise.

Jane, to get to the other side
Community?

I put my gel in this bag
Ridley, you missed when that WAS the topic :P

Sprry dood

Allways.
I'm sorry man
*sad
yeah he raged on me for like 10 minutes then left
>_>
Did you spam him with ponies?
It's the best undead-buddy-action cop movie I've ever seen.
that can annoy people
haha, nah
And one less "friend", fine with me
it is interesting to hate someone because of an isolated hobby.. and pretty weak
got plenty of "friends"
thanks for the transcript by the by
4undead buddy action cop movie?
I'm too zany for people to care
4So it's like Rush Hour...but with zombies?
even my GF was like "and?"
/me doesn't worry about losing friends he doesn't have
:P
Got a bag of flour sitting around? How about some rocks?
4Hey, Rush Hour was good
That really says a lot about him
Rush Hour didn't have Vincent Price.
>_>
tbh If thats all it took for him to stop being friends with you. he wasn't a good friend to start with.
:P
un tool him
Or undead.
lol
yeah
Like I said:
Nah, he's not confident in his manhood
That's basically it
i understand not getting it
He's not straight enough
-snrk- manhood
well they found it odd and went "lol serious?" but yeah
lol
To understand being secure in it
maidenhood?
right
In a groundbreaking role.
It'll die down!
I hope...
maidenhood makes me think of bad fanfics I read when I was younger
oh boy
4Rush Hour
But yeah, I liked Rush Hour.
or some shit? lol
the difference is ide
from man
I'm in college too brah
4But hey, at least we get to see Se7en
I know right? childish behavior on their part
Dangit, I can't get sucked into staying awake any longer!
4next week
Yes you can Ridley
But I don't know about any guys that act like they're in middle school
Which I hadn't heard of until today, lol.
Highschool maybe
joooin usssss
College eh?
EXACTLY
I don't even have middle school where I'm from lol
But the fuck do I care?
Se7en is good.
It's their problems
"Just... just... why?"
see ya Ridley
And I said "why not?"
Still, I bet if I realed off "MUST SEE" films for long enough, you guys wouldn't have seen them all. :P
And then we've stopped discussing it since.
adios ridley
Bye Ridley!
G'niGHT RIDLEY
:D

The Usual Suspects
Entry badge

I've never gone to it though
seems like a waste of time to me
My bf and I get free passes
4I may have seen it...maybe
ugh
I do not know you!
Lol, the first film I say and you're not sure.
Wait, you're a chick? Disregard my invitation

hahaha
lol
I could be a gay man.
You COULD be but
wtf
girls with ponies
Mod status instantly revoked. ;P
XD KARMA
Hahaha.
I tolerate homosexuals
TOLERATE being the keyword
just found this out
ponies or gtfo
I adore homosexuals.
But then, I'm biased
I figured you'd want to know
You've never seen it?
Wow.
yeah
hey guise
4I've seen it
HAI GUIZE
then again she's not huge into cartoons
hi lolwutman
mine either, cyril
Although I support equal rights for those of a...different sexual preference
But...BRUCE LEE!
I wouldn't want to live with one
Just me.
It's an acquired taste - cartoons I mean
:(
or a taste from childhood
Groundhog Day
my wife is (and don't think I'm creepy old by that statment, we are both in our 20's
where does asexuality fit in?
Yes.
4Nope
asexuality-not intrested in fucking at all
XD no you didn't
eh?
i have friends like that
right
You should see it. It's really good.
..
I'm somewhat asexual
XD exactly
Yeah, it's good.
:P
Just not that great
I used to think I was asexual
Well Agnitio, I'd rather tolerate/somewhat support than hate
Ghostbusters.
i don't get it, but if I weren't in a committed relationship i'd probably be a huge slut
4Seen it
asexuality is crap.
Yeah, I tolerate and somewhat support
Seen that.
*cough*
amusingly enough, I'm bisexual, or was before I was married.. I suppose I'm functionally straight now
SHE'S CALLING ME MEAN THINGS AND I'M INCAPABLE OF CLICKING THE "UNFRIEND" OR THE "BLOCK" BUTTON BECAUSE I'M STUUUUPID
Erm. Me.
lol
asexuality is.. interesting to me
NO WAY! O_o
Eyup.
in an academic way
oh good lord
or another translation
you have to watch it!
I'm pansexual. Like Jack Harkness level.
I JUST WANT EVERYONE'S ATTENTION
i support all sexualities(striaght here)
4Actually, I've only seen snippets of it
yeah
i don't really understand pansexuality? explain?
DEFEND ME
think of the gigantic twinkies!
See?
lol "look at that.. it's beautiful." "jack... that's a poodle"
not really
BE AT MY EVERY BECK AND CALL PLEASE :'(((((
O__________________o
they are not talking about detil

isn't that bisexuality?
detail
I like boys, girls, gender-fluid, transgender, genderqueer, intersexed
pansexuality..... _>

Lets float

his name isn't billy though
PRIMUS FTW
4Tommy Boy
lol alright then
cyrilthepony mine either, but she is more tv sitcoms then cartoons. although she wants me to take her to an anime convention badly xD
did I get muted?
opinions on the hardest pony to draw?
he was always a... troublemaker
pony-tastic
B00LLY
Haven't seen that.
I'm curious on that one actually
Fluttershy, her parents named her fluttershy, but.....
did her parents somehow know she would be shy?
Celestia is the hardest I think.
:P
Haha, or maybe that too
never attempted it (yet) I'm sure it'll be a pain
I dunno though
it was a self fulfilling proficy
hmmm
he also wasn't always the brightest bulb...
ncie
:3
I'll get around to Ghostbusters sometime, I promise. ;P
*nice
*shuttefly I mean
maybe they get a unicorn to see le future for every childpony
even if he did do dumb things sometimes
it is interesting that their names are sorta prophetic
Rainbow Dash always dresses in style!
Never seen Trading Places.
Fooby you should they are loads of fun :3
:P
why are teenagers stupid
I wish Solo shows were easier for non-djs :<
No, the film.
4Oh
>Implying games based on movies are any good
4Meh
because they have too many hormones and if they don't know how to control them it ends up killing their brain
...does that say "Not" Spike or "Hot" Spike?
4>goes off to find a list of movie-based games
I'll actually rephrase that
I could see how her parents would name her Rainbow Dash after seeting her mane
Besides Jurrasic Park.
/me stole the name from the comic Goblins
eyup
eyup
Competition and whatnot.
lol
why
why are they all stupid
Yup
4SAw
4Saw
yeah, in that case I never knew
legaly?
or nick
4was fun, I actually really enjoyed Saw
I don't think it's a last-name situation.
*high fives DJmidli*
Sequal was really fun too.
why does Rarity have no last name? haha
4Oh, and Goldeneye
yeah
or secondary name, whatever
4*example
Cuz she's too rare
/me brohoofs lolwutman
I WANT MY BF 2 GIVE ME HIS COAT IN -20 DEGREE WEATHER
hoihoihoihoih
haha
I wouldn't know.
=(
3 syable rule.
maybe she does but never mentions it outside of legal documents
except to you guys
Would the same be said of Fluttershy or Applejack?
b/c you guys are my bffs
ohhh
4Eh, I didn't like Goldeneye either
How many examples does it take to exceed "the exception that proves the rule"?
cool
:D
Applejack Apple?
4As many as needed?
oh wait, thats right
infinite
They never officially say that.
Atleast 9000
Nice and specific.
well, apple family, apparently
or extreemly vauge
Anime north! No shit.
:P
not at you feeling like I used to
I keep wishing I'd gone to that.
eyyup
yeah I know
:P
Halo. ;P
I may be derpy but I'm not insensitive
:P

the derpiness comes with being a dude
we're all a bit dumb

4Hah, Halo
Emotional depth of a teaspoon.
yep
yes netsplits

4Eh, strokes for different folks
Never played Halo.

REAL MEN WATCH MLP:FIM AND ARE PROUD OF IT

Twilight is best pony

I'm getting Flutter/Twilight. More pockets!
XD
lol
Sure.
purple is best color Donatello
yeah
Whattteeeeeeeeeeever you say.
I don't even associate the word Twilight with vampires anymore
does machines
Wait...
i was just listening to it
Rainbow Dash is cool but rude
pinkie pie is a
not sure at all
ninja'd
i was questioning it too
it did. This show is the best thing to happen to vampires in a while
Haha.
Pinkie Pie first came off as a normal overly excited cartoon character
Fluttershy /Rarity leads?
And my perspective changed.
yeah
hypocrites
I thought Rena was a normal yandere.
I care
me too
it's kinda hurtful
Ok, not really.
kinda though

I'm about to post the best song in the world.

Fightingamphibians.

Well.
I get it
oh
4:P
lol
:P
Is this Battletoads?
Theoretically it goes well with a lot of religions. It's in practice where things go awry.
If he hit you, he would be going to jail.
Room full of witnesses.
either way
he was a jerkface either way
JB?
until rumors come around
yeahh
rumors spread like... something that spreads
mostly people are nicer about it if they ask
one of my friends is kind of rude about it though
but I'm too nice to tell him to stop it

4Fightingamphibians is a pun for Battletoads, yes
4I've only been to the site once, though
Shoulda gone with CombatAmphibians tho.

wow
4I have actually
4And I enjoyed it, even if I did lose track of where the film was going halfway after the movie was over...
at least when brock cooked and made food puns he was wearing a lacey doily apron
which made up for it
XD yeah
My quit message
:P
goodnight
:P
Seen the sequal?
Night everypony
man it died in here
4No, I haven't. I probably should though
hi people I don't know
Hello there
hi Flashgen

I need it O.O

And then I exploded with sad http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/169/6/7/artist_training_ground_day_23_by_egophiliac-d3jag0t.jpg
hahha
that's awesome
Ofcourse.
:(
4Then it's worth seeing
It is.
;_;
4I'll admit, I do like some action films
4But overall, I just can't get into the ones released today
You can't just doubleclick it [zZz]ekeS?
:P I have no problem with the recent ones.
;_;
Machete from last year might be the best action movie I've ever seen.
I'm beginning to give up on trying
D'awwww
snips, snails
4I can't remember his name :(
Thunderstorms?
thank you deviantArt for ruining my childhood
Machete wasn't bad... I didn't care for bits of it... but it was generally good
On MY dad's fathers day?

Didn't have Tarantino. Tho he may have had a hand with producing or something. I dunno.

4Speaking of Tarantino, I did wanna see Inglorious Bastards
6AMAZING MOVIE
:D
SOOO GOOD
for the record
actually we need some fathers day images ponified.
I barely made it.
She broke my heart
/me tears up
*surround
(on a side note I really should add that autotinyurl script, but I'm not sure I want every link that pops up in irc sent off)
You got it right the second time.
4And I guess you never saw it, Turni?
okay
12bbl
Some just slip by. :P
4*nods*
Anyone have a favourite film?
4*here
Deal with it.
4Jacob's Ladder
4My most favorite film of all time
Also. Yes, just seeing if there was someone here.
where's the fun in that Fooby
Well I could. :P
xm28e4
Probably the only horror movie that has ever given me the chills.
Hmm, I don't really see that happening, I don't have a favourite of anything really.
who's still up?
Fluttershy...
make me a women
4What did you think, Turni?
i am
Predicted the twist off-hand. :P
Night, moon.
Eh... Dissapointing. Besides the solid opening.
Which had a great atmosphere. And I thought the rest would be like that.
But then, that combination is more terrifying than many things.
4Well, yeah, the movie is based heavily on religion and symbolism
The hospital scene was pretty good. But the rest wasn't exactly scary or creepy.
I agree, but.. best be sure :P
I don't blam eya'
blame*
sho'nuff
Oh
This is the best fandom I have ever seen, I am proud to be part of it
I shall stick with The Machinist. ;P
6Never seen it.
4Neither have I, actually
4You think I'm gonna kick you, don'tcha?
I suppose it is kind of like Jacob's Ladder in some ways.
6I think you CAN'T
Lol, you can't kick him.
4...Oh yeah!?
^_^
Oh.
Just make out allready. ;P
This really is an awesome/weird fandom.
XD
yes it is
6What?
4You were there, Sprinks -_-
6I was not paying attention then. XD

I wouldn't be surprised if you guys were married.

T.T <---Manly tears

6Silver lives in PA.
They live together.
4North Carolina
4DCD is in Paname?
4*Panama
4I know he's not in America
http://i.imgur.com/0b1AI.jpg
4is
6Yeah, it's Panama
Then I would steal her for myself!
;)
He's not as dedicated as I am.
:P
4Yeah, dedicated that you were on our most wanted list for about two weeks
;D
But you see I'm really not a bad man.
Am I the Highlander?
I have the best of intentions.
Besides. I'm probably off that list by now. :P
4Yes, well, at least now we finally found a system that works
I think if you're off the list, there isn't a list any more. :P
6No, there's one pony I've been watching.
4Yeah, there's not exactly a "people us mods are finding annoyances with" list anymore
4It was all pretty much Turni : /
6Because I don't want word spreading.
6I'll tell you later, maybe.
Someone had to champion some sort of "oposition" ;P
4Dude, you know you're not supposed to keep secrets from other mods : /
Alright
I wish XChat supported ctrl-tab
Sprinkleburg?
Normal nick he goes by is MFW
Yeah, he used that.
I thought it was him
He also used Brony_Hipster
It looked like he was annoying you earlier today
And one other nick.
He trolls a bit with each nick before changing.
Can you give me an example how?
It's little things that slowly add up, mostly.
He also used BroDashRain
As a nick.
But yeah.
I remember that aswell.
4Well, Turni, you know that taste is purely subjective
Sure, sure.
4Dude, Turni
That was the idea.
4Come on
But I wanted to see something I hadn't seen before. :P
I think I actually warned him earlier...
4Not the mods' fault
Did he keep up?
Like I said. I never ever once blamed the mods.
goodnight
I don't see why you shouldn't get a kick automatically for talking too much.
just watched the NPR radio
I warned him right before he left for the night.
4You mentioned something about "bribing the mods." Don't think that didn't go unnoticed
How was it?
That's the way IRC is mostly, and you can just rejoin straight away.
Watching radio
It wasn't as bad as I thought
4You sounded awfully trollish a few times
it seems kind of like a cheap shot
That was a joke, lighten up.
I did not watch it.
NPR just wants to fit iiin
I'm hesitant because we get some ponies that don't know how IRC works and don't know how to rejoin.
They can always refresh the page.
6Myself as well.
/me is drunk
Fluttershy D:
It was not.
I never thought that Fluttershy would drink.
she has before
in that one fic
daterape
yep
eyo :3
perhaps that's why she's turned to animals instead?
Yeah, we could tell them how to rejoin
now getting tosti's
:o
....
One broke my heart.
4And that dari is why you're the chatroom :P
i like Grandma's Tosti's
meh just came in
You could even add it into the kick message I suppose.
Hahaha.
*Pokes Aristeo*
wtf why is the face cross eyes
:o
eyed*
:o
No... no... I just came back from one of Pinkie's parties.
I am daed
ahh you are still awake
We should probably at least tell people about it by visiting the rules. Then again, we do that every BMN
I am dated
I am dot
Face it, you took it all alittle too seriously.
I am dedddd
I see...
deadddaded
4It just seemed really distasteful to those guys

That's kinda annoying.
<_>
< o >
wadn't me
4And that's why I'm glad everybody is finally, for the most part, on the same page
¬¬
Anyone sending as many messages as is required for a kick anyway is pretty hard.

Insanly
I dunno
I can't argue it's status this time. :P
It's pretty empty
but no one talking
idk how to describe it
Ohh.
The swap to IRC
Yeah
yeah
before there were like 20 people in a channel, but each one was talking
Oh, wait.
I get it.
58 people here, and only 6 talking
hmm
4Have you seen it already? Oh, a clip
And saw the running time. :P
I'm talking
mm... nah
Hello Dash.
You could really play a extra pony ep in the end.

Wait.
Hm...
Lol fail.
o.o?
4Wut?
4WELL I GUESS TURNIBRONY DECIDED TO LEAVE
We are deader than a cadaver.
4The jerk >:I
:/
Think he crashed maybe.
...
From the quit message.
4Eh, oh well
There's no reason that password should be incorrect.
4You saw how he left?
4Huh, neat
Okay.
There we go.
Cool.
I have a voice.
You guys don't. :P
:P
lol I just watched the MLP:FiM episode Pinkie Keen
aww
You want a voice?
4I can speak just fine dari
oO;
Sprinks, main room
How?
Is that acceptable?
I doubt he'll say much, not many people left. :P
Hm...
Haha.
Good point
And now I'm in for a while.
for some reason
I'll ask again
y6es
I see RarityxRD working
IS IT ACCEPTABLE?
When she just drops from the sky. takes it, then flies off
oO
I dunno why though
/me now belongs to lightumbreon|mibbit for 20 minutes
Hey mib_5rubc6.
I've got auto identity going, and that's all that matters.
Oh that reminds me I have a friend and she is always complaining about there never being any RarityxRD fanfiction.
Can't wait for more.
Well, can...
Y'know, figure of speech.
oo
I really wanna start a fanfic
but I just can't seem to find the inspiration for one
Kinda the same for me.
Fairly Odd Parents?
eh?
Welp, just the three of us.
OH
Oh oh oh I can help
Actually no, I was just saying it for no reason.
>Rewatch old episodes
>make a conspriacy out of it
4Just like old times
>instant fanfic.
BAM
lol
lol fairly odd parents
Hang on.
Let me grab a screenshot,
'cause this is is how a friend and I are going to co-author an AWESOME fic
It's a trap!
Oh whoops.
I always forget to turn these things off.
4True
hehehe
4I post in reds
Suddenly.
Also
4Oh, now you're just showing off
:P
Change them
Use a Logitech
http://i134.photobucket.com/albums/q120/leaf_on_wind/whatarethosedoingthere.png
i use a ZBoard, a gaming model, the best out there
Lawl.
yeah I remember that
I tried a random kick.
I'm the only person I can kick.
FiM = Avatar perfection with more <3 ^_^
Oh, I can't even kick myself.
I think it suits her
Random kick, but it 12 tries for it to try and kick me with only 3 of us on here.
Lol.
4Dari, I would kick you but you're the hobo of our chatroom that we feel sorry for. That, and you ARE the chatroom, I can't kick you!
Eek!
hmm...
Take a note.
XD MFW
Hehe, timing
I am terminated?
You left ages ago.
why wouldn't she?
An idea is forming...
XD MFW?
but I don't think I can make a story with it
4And Turni returns
I never left
it doesn't show rarity's dress i think
It was only 17 minutes ago, apparently I'm just going crazy.
You're doing it wrong.
My Face When
Guess it kicked me out for inactivity or something.
If you want a fic idea,
MAKE A CONSPIRACY OUT OF IT
idk
FLUTTERSHY THE MASTER THIEF
right.....
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/108/766/MLP_Books_4.jpg?1301091345
Yeah...
Well I can do something about Fluttershy's hidden past.
I have her dresses.
I guess.
Though normally when that happens you'll get "Ping timeout 120 seconds".
She keeps bothering with me.
W-what hidden past?!
i have a book here
/me looks around suspiciously
it's awesome, no, epic
The best fic is a good fic.
Don't worry, I have no idea as of now.
it was expensice, aroun 67 Euro's
You'll think of something.
Maybe it was custom styled to fit my personal needs.
I strongly recommend this to all writers.. http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter.html
because the special edition was expensive
/me runs
I dunno, maybe they changed the default timeout message for this network, though I've never seen any other networks which give message other than that for a ping timeout.
Apparently
Its a novel writing program, basically, information storage.. best to have a look, its the best I have seen.
you can make chapters with it
Storyboard, character bios... the lot
and yes
DNF
Then I convert to ebook formats (epub usually) using Calibre 2
yes
I take fics from here on my ebook reader :)
yes, it came out not too long ago
already beated it :P
I prefer to write things as I feel it
then break it up and edit it
I heard a lot of people were disappointed with it.
those where alot of CoD fanatics
Its good for that
only because Gearbox helpt Develop DNF
I ended up swapping chapters and things with stories I have written
Sweeping generalisation FTW.
They were like
Gearbox also made Modern Warfare 2
1.9 meg
Nothing much for me.
i want to laugh, i'm gonna quote them too xD
And apperantly the rest is doing their best Fluttershy impression.
Sorry if this is classified as spamming, itll be the last msg
4I have the demo for DNF, but I never finished it
Hehe
Maybe I should try the demo.
Cause playing FPSes on a laptop is hella rad.
4Haha, I'd only play Doom II :D
4My laptop isn't meant for gaming
Well I do have a pair of unfinished stories somewhere in my notebooks
Neither is mine. Don't have a mouse either. :P
bbl in a bit
k'
Ditto
One I start writing.. I cant stop
It's starting that's hard.
That and finding another scene to switch to
Oh, cool.
Mono.
you know you have the main idea down
One I start
OoOOooOoOOoh.
I'll give it a try.
ditto
"yay"
I'm using a personal wiki to keep track of that shit right now.
lol
But having everything in one place would be cool.
Mmm, thats a good idea
:o Story idea.

Yeah, because half ops can't kick half ops
Mm, it did for me.. they might be invisible to the OS
But ops can kick ops.
Yep
10:49AM
Makes no sense.
where do you live
Tch, Canadian riots aren't as good as SAmerican soccer riots.
I've been thinking of picking up and moving there...for many reasons....one being I despise summer...
G3 IZ BES.. BAD
Norway
Ahh the hunt begins:)
ALL OF U
I need a clever name for Pinkie
PaintSplash most of our cities still have summer. unless you go further up north.
context*
something like my previous names
You're only an hour ahead of me Turni.
PaintSplash 85% of us live within 300km of the US border. you have to be one of the 15% that doesn't for lack of summer
Have you not slept yet?
now granted our "Summer" is still shorter and not as hot as lets say..neveda
yes
Well...I was hoping for a cooler summer...
It's all June Gloom here in LA
than where I currently reside...
uhhhhhhh
got up at 11:00 haven't rested once
bye
Well. I woke up at 22:00 or something.

well, was it taken alrady
the humidity is ottawa specific however as we live in a valley
Same as in any other places. Only it's in the future
damn mind blown
PaintSplash not really. we get used to hearing crazy things about americans opinions on our weather.
Its productive though :P
including I apparently live in an igloo year round :P
cool (pun intended)
o/
which Id have to move like 700KM further north to do.
How do you guys do that?
I guess I live up to being a clueless american then.
maybe
4No
The name thing.
okay
4<3
At least I don't automatically claim Canda as AMerica's hat and the like.
The...Name thing?
Hehe http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic
no the cat face thing
I think that only happens on mibbit when you write out the full nick of someone who's in the channel.
bawww you hert my feellings shacky
i'm shacking right now for some reason
Yeah.
Oh.
Now I just feel silly.

FlutterAwesome: In much the same way that Fluttershy sleeps with a P90 under her matress or how Pinkie Pie uses gasoline on the weekends.
THE ALMIGHT BUTTON
well, not button
/shun *@*
hurr durr
Looks like fun.
12Ascendant
12i hate ROMs

You could call Pinkie, PinkLemonade or maybe PinkieFruitCake
7:(
lolwut?
That was a bit random.
O_o
Uhh.

I remember making her one before...
7warm
*snerk*
Eh, its to much of a hassel for me to venture in to manehattan anyway...I hate being there.
hm. Applejack....
7so now this is getting awkward
7but i don't care
PaintSplash you really owe it to yourself to go to a meetup
7for you are my mare just usin it cause it rhymes
;o
boo
COWSSSS
I WANT BEEF
even if it is somewhere like NYC
12Floofy beef :3
:o
beef
People with their strange ways of talking at school has made me think of beef differently.
Now I'm just thinking of it in the "Allow the beef, man" sort of way.
7like fluttershy
Argh.
now i'm hungry.....
Hehe, Great minds think alike :)
12My favorite beef is jerky
my favourite is beefy and meaty beef
xD
SNEAS.
12Wb
06~~
Yessir?
haha
I've got this random mp3 sitting on my desktop labelled 'Happiness'
PaintSplash chatted about favourite ponies and etc.
!chatstats

Stats updating at http://www.ho-ohrealm.net/chat/chatstats...
12Ascendant is a nerd D:
Any idea where it came from?
I guess that was pretty straight forward huh?
Isukra:
12Good night everyone :3
how does it sound.
Gnite GL :3
basey, technoey, housey?
BANBANBANBANBABANBAN
drummy?
I'm sort of half asleep, I should have assumed.
Pretty basey
12lol
12what
On a poo?
Impressive typo.
^
12Iskierka, help me find a name that isn't too much like yours
enter is too close to backspace
it keeps the lyrics intact or are they chopped up kinda?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Uv6XLHJYL8
Mostly intact, but it loops parts of it a lot
I'm here.
hmm.
7leaving me cold and unhappy
Also WB Turni.
why can't you find one yourself? I'm terrible for names
tbh if you have MU, upload the track, and ill be able to ID it in 10seconds flat.
we noticed...
cause I'm CONSTANTLY keeping up to date on the remixes xD
Maybe it would be easier if I just uploa- Yep.
(comes with the territory of being a DJ)
O_o
How many times have you been asked to drop one of these remixes on an unsuspecting club?
Suddenly.
How do I change my name back?
None yet. I don't spin at clubs
Tonnes or loads?
7come on I've said weirder things in this song
a promoter in ottawa is getting one together.
but no not normally.
given the sucesss of the fandom she's trying to find a venue etc etc and get something pulled off.
Maybe I just got cloned like in the 6th Day.
I'm all the way at the bottom of Australia
Here's the song, by the way
http://www.mediafire.com/file/8k1797rtm46cwi3/Happiness.mp3
7and this day has been long
YEA!~
12Iskierka
12i'm worse
12lightumbreon|mibbit is worsee than both of us though :3
no, i'm the worst
:D Tassie or Melbourne?
they asked me to name a elder, i named him DustBone
X.x
Melbourne, you?
12that's a great name :D
Melbourne
Welp, I'm gonna hit the hay...
that was not an intentional pny realted remark...
gnite paint
i foun it too Sarcastic

Nini :)
7come on say yes
What's the song about?
G'night
Its was nice talking to everpony.
Night
7anything
nice talking to you too
Night!
7you want
Allright. Atleast alittle.
;o
7awsome
Once I was on a date
But my choices sealed my fate
Oh torrents..ohu
Because brutalising leather is awesome
Now that rape scene was awkward I'll tell you
12lol
12i don't do sarcasm online
7keep going
7or not
Now she won't ever see me again
too bad, you seem good at it
Won't even call me a friend
12shhh godmodder D:
She just said "stop stop stop!"
why? my RP character is awesome :3
my copy is from the biweekly music colection waka updates.
Brilliant! Thank you!
yours is a meanie D:
12no
Yeah, I've been in there looking for boots
Or something.
12your RP character is really unfair and has no weaknesses, virtually impossible to beat
12that is a bad character
yeah i can't believe its sitting at 1.4gb now
7no thats a movie for lonsome time
Was awkward enough to watch alone. :<
06lolgodmodding
Why's it awkward?
7should have been postpone
12!espeon
/me now belongs to Isukra for 8 minutes
Good point
12Espeon can godmod me all he wants
7where i could rome
Then you have the freedom to download a graphic to the machine
12he's worth it :3
I tried RPing once, I just felt stupid. O_o
7and make some fome
Please do not swear. You have sworn 1 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
Hey Jen.
Something subtle like 20% cooler or just full on Pinkie Pie mid-skip?
12lightumbreon|mibbit
Nothing but another person?
you want to know them?
You are nothing but another person. O_o
Sevral minute long rape scene.
Friends are special people.
They're still just people.
erm...it includes floof, hugs, tickling, and freinds
They're people. But not JUST another person.
Strangers are still just people. O__o
most stupid weaknesses ever :/
7and i'll strut up
7gett on in the ruff
Bedroom scenes I have no real problem with. :P
7just in you and me in the buff
Friends aren't just some random person. They're someone you know and that you should be able to trust, not end up in tears over some <censored>.
Please do not swear. You have sworn 2 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
7making it tough
:D I saw someone wearing a 20% cooler shirt yesterday too :P
06I would say you're swearing for the sake of it, but I'll just pretend it doesn't happen :P
7but we like it rough
12lightumbreon|mibbit
12those aren't really weaknesses at all
I don't need to cause drama
Maaaaaybe
06Just take care, alright?
That way no one else can steal it.
7and it'll make you tough
First type /nick the_you_want_here
Oh cool!
https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEZtWExHMmNNWXBDWTMzR1JUbGxrN1E6MQ
7like i said you and me in the buff
and Isukra, more weaknesses: Shaving off floof, and i think you remember that one.... D:<
7but now that time is over
12not really a weakness
7i guess was just a pushover
12you grew the hair back in like an hour
...
:D
12and it didn't cause you any real distress
7and like a rover
-le sigh-
OoOoh pretty...
7you left me their
12we are having 2 different definitions of weaknesses going on here XD
well, there is one
7ohhohoohoho
7whoohooho
Waaant
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7JH1FT_yM&feature=related
7how could you
Ok.
7just leave me to die
12my definition of a weakness is something that is really effective against you, giving you a large disadvantage in a fight if such thing is used against you.
12whats yours? XD
i just said it
DX
I think on this network it sends you a confirmation email.
With a code to complete the registration.
12you're not a dialga
his rarity* cause "it was garbage" wow.
heartbreaking
I jawdropped when I heard about it.
i killed a Dialga
7but still i cry
http://applejack.sourceforge.net/ <---
Applejack
06I don't really have any established "character" or anything anyway soo :P
06No
7and i die a little inside
06It has applejack
06Just npo
Helping people solve their Mac problems
06no
12lol
Ohhi
!espeon
!isukra
06because HAH
7as i contemplate sucide
/me flops
7but nooooo!
7 i am strong
:DDD
Espeon
rp characters don't necessarily need explicit weaknesses. they just need to not be all-powerful and behave realistically
06Not much at all.
agreed Iskierka, Lightumbreon isn't the most powerfull oe
Lightlugia and G-1 are :P
12the way i see it
7jenemmy do want to join in my song
lol Could be.
12we all have strengths and weaknesses irl
^
12if you make a character with no weaknesses whatsoever
lol
12you aren't being very realistic
tbh i have a feeling it was more of the sterotyping bs.
but not necessarily explicit ones
Lawl.
12we all have explicit weaknesses as well irl
06About to say Weakness: Bullets or something like that @dari xD
i have a weakness irl
12something we keep to only ourselves because it could cause great harm if that info got into the wrong hands
We do
7because i've been making up a song since 5:48 or somethong
?
Pjony he's talking about the "Self-medicates by watching ponies"
Pretty common sadly, especially in these times and as teens find themselves, become their own person..
7so i got else to put on
agreed
Okey Dokey Lokey!
but that's not something that would be an explicit weakness, in my eyes
And when the sun shines
7keep us strong
I like the Gorden Freemane avatar.
I don't have some specific weakness IRL.
The light hits my eyes
Painfully.
But you know this whole thing is wrong.
*most common interests
You and me, and me and you.
06But completely randomly but still related
06the ones that I get annoyed at the most
06xD
a character made specifically for battling should be balanced, yes
7take flight
ditto
12and has no weakness
Get rid of the cold and heartless nights.
agreed
^
(Wow, never thought I'd get this far)
also Pjony it doesn't help that it states hes unemployed.
Woaaaahhh
Wooo-ooo-aahh-ohhhh.
which is where fox decided to stretch the truth like crazy and say we are all seeking welfare because where "addicted to pony"
7whhhhhhhhhhhooooooooooahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Go with the flow.
12i know
12i'm just giving an example
Unlock the code.
and of course, powerfull things, maybe even religions
06I never understood it anyway
7just enter the mode
06why not eat it?
Think about the world drowning but you're afloat.
^
12XD
06kinda
Well lots of saying don't make sense when you take them out of the context of how they were originally formed.
06Yes
7so go to the goat
...
In fact most tend not to make sense until you actually look at their origins.
main cassarole of the day
Empty the moat?
/me nods
riiight, cause being unemployed is compareable across the pond to eating babies
Stand around, watch 'em gloat.
ANYWHERE
correct.
I SAY ANYWHERE~
Mmmmmm
Mmmhmmmmmmm~
*how
I was talking about sayings, but I agree with whatever you're talking about too. XD
7but stop right there
Living in a trailer park spending every cent you get on drugs and living on food stamps
yep.
7cause i'm no normal mare
as the stereotype goes.
i know right xD
12XD
(It's all you, I'm clueless)
7cuase i've got the stare
Interesting.
I know one other.
/me lost track .-.
Ok I get that kinda about the self-medication thing
But, there has to be more..
12o-o
but the first quote-quote is imo pretty damn great
And when FiM show here...
7if you don't work as a pair
06Oh
06well I guess that makes more sense o.O
12and eat it too
12well
06o3o
7(got anything or i'm going to say something stupid)
12you have to wait to get to the house or where ever you are stopping
12however i have never heard of such a zone XD
7and i got no(dammit)
i won'tr obey the rules in a no-cake zone

11so its come down to this an Mexican stand-off
11nobody wants to pull the trigger
Don't be an hero.
11but i've got to
11its been to damn long
...
11and were all gonna pay in the end one way or another
11its just about when
K well
11becuase none of is innocent
its 6:40am and i probably should get some sleep. night all
nini
G'night
03What I feel like atm
11so its gotta end sometime might as well be now
11so you bastards ready for one last stand-off
11well are you
11(BANG)
:( C'mon with series 2.. I am running out of s1 eps..
11wtf are guys doing
I havent seen them all.
Up to 17
Yep
Ill probably be through them tomorrow though :-/
or keeping us from doing stupid things
Ive been reading fics anyway
Ill be writing them myself soon as well
wouldn't that spoil later episodes?
Not offshoots
11thats right norway run you damn corward!
alright
I have a couple of weeks off starting next week
06Considering how many of us humans think and act, it's pretty much needed :P
I can always watch it all again :)
Oh my.
I have been on this whole time.
Silly me.
I was on Equestria Daily P:
lolwat
No law = Somalia
like, you CAN go around killing people, and get away with it
doesn't make sense :/
That's the point.
Freedom.
too much freedom can be a problm
maybe more :/
11hello
That is the point, lol.
the law is needed to keep humanity in control, to but it bluntly, that is
If freedom is outlawed, then only outlaws have freedom.
^
No offense, but it takes you an awful long time to type, doesn't it?
11yes
Technically yes, because everyone has different opinions.
11but i can type helluva lot
everyone his/her opinion
or something :/
06Humans are super-protective about their opinions, add violent behavior and a lack of laws and there might be freedom - but I wouldn't say it's a good kind of freedom.
that is the whole point
wheps
got to go
off to Home
12lol
cycling from grandma to home, takes aprox. a hour
There has to be a balance.
11okay maybe extragtion but still
BBL by then :3
12is that if there werre no laws
12how many criminals would there be?
I think my head is now flat from all the facepalming, headdesking, etc.
06see ya LU
06It's fox news
06and it's the media
06they like scandals
faux news
ew
06And yes, there has to be a balance
This
12!exakr
/me now belongs to Isukra for 15 minutes
06and until we learn to keep that on our own without laws holding our hand (read: never), then removing them would lead to quite a bit of oddness.
/me dies
12don't die
12eXAKR would never forgive me
[21:00:31] <%Isukra> is that if there werre no laws
[21:00:37] <%Isukra> how many criminals would there be?
That is the point though
06hell they would probably screw up a report on trains or something
06and inb4 "no laws, no criminals"
lmao time
ing
timing
._.
Well
Right and wrong is defined by opinion alone
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/130811898765.png
Whether something is socially acceptable is an entirely different thing
Now that is defined by law
06well yeah, social norms can control things to a certain extent but
In a way, laws are the "Majority Rules"
i'm trying to find a good screensaver atm.
As I said there has to be a balance
Which was the MLP:FiM episode with the baked bads
But in a world without laws
Using a shot of Pinkie's sick face
Everyone would have to learn to fight for themselves
Survival of the fittest
Again, Somalia
not ideal either
bbl
bbl
06Alright
11i got to go to sleep

I don't know
Don't watch Fox News
i tried to find something googling it but i found just a lot of rant
Hmmm
That crap shouldnt be allowe to be called news though
They aren't
Only called news by Faux
This wouldn't be an issue in Japan.
japan has a different way of dealig with these things...
oh i think it's just a different cultural approach
The fuck did all this "bronies are umeployed" shit come from?
can't remember the year, but not that much ago
The Fox segment with the Baby Man only?
Excuse the language
I am glad the world is changing.
Are they just considered like Marilyn Manson here?
googling
Look up Malice Mizer
Hi
well, now... that's just bad taste...
lol
A pony doing that? :(
how do you pm here?
type /msg name message
Yup
got it!
What's up Johnsey?
lalala

THE FATTEST PONY EVER
Hat Simulator 2*
It's going away I think.
I always wake up with a hangover.
It's not from drinking though
why?
Had to get it just to play Empire Total War....OFFLINE
oh ok
!mbox read 1
That's like rewarding you for piracy.
ARRGH
Yes
wrong channel
fanfic binge last night... running on very few hours sleep today
I buy games and then remove the DRM from them.
I'm going to the mall at noon.
lol I never thought of that!
ponies have ... saddles..? because.. it's fashionable? wut?
Like fashion has ever made sense.
but where'd they get the idea in the first place? :I
look, ponies usually are naked
a saddle is an improvin in any case
Horse shows, I imagine
convergent evolution
*improvement
Somewhere to put saddlebags :P
aren't that just shown as straps in the show?
Some types of saddles are lingerie
Ponies from Bronyville can wear them :P They are merely fashionable. (Theres proper pony avatars)
Even in the show, Spike is going through Twilight's drawers and grabs a blue frilly saddle out of one
lol

Hi
Welcome back
Thanks
06And you're totally not being the kind of "brony" that people find obnoxious by posting pony reaction images. totally not.
back
i had to break in into my own house
key wouldn't fit
06~~
I smell sacarsm
NS
06Of course not
06Fox always finds the most extreme example of anything
Espeon
I posted pony images only because it concerns ponies
If it's something else, it may or may not be ponies
Depending on how suitable the image was
06I know that, it was somewhat sarcastic :P
UGH more pony talk x.x
why cant that crap fad die already
O.o
chill out...please

hey Sneas
ahhh the ultimate showdown in pony version http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RLm9t-hOPo&feature=player_embedded
Dunno
You know, I was thinking
OMG
All of the MLP:FiM main characters have jobs
--.-
Except Twilight, who's a student
apple optimus prime WIN
WHY YOU NO HI ME.
I am unimportant.
I see how it is.
FINE.
/me idles.
06and this is relevant to anything why?
^
xD
XD
;p
/me replaces it with care
/me RUND
/me RUNS*
...
06I mean sometimes I feel like people do not use a pony channel just because they enjoy people complaining about it
06I can see the appeal personally but
06Because tears taste delicious, but still
06And i did not say that's the reason, it just sometimes feels like it ;P
Maybe because not too many people know about it
Not everyone cares about ponies, k?
...
Rape
Well, not rub
But shove it, literally
This...this is awesome. XD
#ponies
You there?
06I do think that someone interested in it and such should be making it though
xD
You find this annoying why?
06And I'm personally not annoyed o.O. The only thing a little bit odd is that sometimes things are posted as if everyone cares about it.
^
The ponies being posted as if everyone in the whole wide world actually cares
06I mean, maybe it could recruit more forum-goers to join irc too, there's quite a few pony people there..
/me hides
lmao
I eat crowbars.
well
which it shouldnt be
/me runs
06¨No one denies that it's popular
No.
Yeah, well, we're not denying it
Just No.
But that doesn't mean that everyone cares
sigh
maybe something more low level
;p
I don't.
drf doesn't
06And see, I'm not saying that ponies shouldn't be allowed in this channel.
just keep the pony talk to a very very minimum
derp
Annoying as it may be
NOT with those cartoons
I'm going to do that
:D
lmao no...just no.
I'm not that stupid
I know you aren't
I was kidding
06That is all I have to say from my viewpoint anywho
EW THAT FACE

You can be cool when you're not being those things

Those are too far, yes
06Yes
06It all just comes down to
But it's not like I'm spamming ponies to the point of Cubing or anything
and oO
lightumbreon lol
You have to admit
That was a bit extreme
People have crossed ponies with EVERYTHING.
'lo there.
06All I'm really saying is that I don't see why there's not a #ponysomething channel. I mean, it would be more fun discussing ponies with like-minded people without all the complaints and such.
>_>
06The pony fandom is certainly
06creative
06no doubt .-.
The problem is, not too many people going there
8D
#bronyclub or otherwise
then i'll go there!
rant against me
whassup?
no problem, as long as nothing goes to #Silverwings of it
06Now lets just flop over and continue our day~~~
*coughsscough*
yes Espeon
>_>
^
I'm done
Everyone has their own opinions
but too extreme opinions
or overly expressing them
is annoying
and stupid :/
lol
That tends to happen a lot
bbl getting chips
k
But it's empty when I checked
brb, going to get a snack
06That reminds me of a dream I had as a kid to be honest
06I dreamt I had this toy, and when I woke up and realized it was a dream I sadface
06d
06:P
06yay realistic dreams?
^
o laughed
06I prefer the insanely surreal ones though
I have some...interesting ones.
which I really do want
And (PONY CONTENT WARNING) last night I dreamt of MLP:FiM figures that are aimed at adults
oo
Also I found a bag of chips stashed in my home
:D
06I got all the wrong images in my head now
06Anywhoooooooooooooooo
<%Espeon> I got all the wrong images in my head now <-- lmao
"BIG". My mind.
bfgtkj
sorry, just ehadbanging
06nope

06Hi :3
13<3
Labeling things makes communication easier.
13ohai :3
But it doesn't mean one thing only has one label
One piece of music can be of multiple genres
06<3 Hi :)
13I've decided to be 50% lazier today
06scary
You can't feel it.
06and how is that possible?

It's too adorable. I can't not-smile while listening.
Jazza: embarrasment? :p
http://equestriagirls.com/
eeyup.com
Also i heard Katy parry made a parody of that song
she did?
/me adds these sites to his pony bookmarks
. . . . .
Yeah she did
It's called California Gurls
It's far from as good as Equestria Girls
Supposedly being the key word.
I want more pony websites
And again.
And again.
I've already clicked it a few times
Mooooar

13I'll make sure to talk to him myself if he doesn't
13but on the other hand, maybe it'd be wise for you not to post as much MLP-related content as you have been doing
And derpy has already done that
Along with breaking my computer screen -_-

YES
Oooh you get a present if you're on the good-guy list?
what's up with these lists?

Strict PG for you.
And you.
And all of you.
Oh hi
6yeh but that could be anything
Hi
6they say it's unofficial
yea
is that a website?

It's another channel
6but does that really mean I can just print out my grades from my college's online system
EquestriaAfterDark?
6that seems horribly...not official
/join "Channelnamehere"
or do that
the things they are saying in there!
it's unnatural!
Whaddafu-
it's unethical!
6I have an issue with that last part xD
6tomorrow is the deadline lol
Well.
yea!
That is why EAD is EAD.
And minors or persons with barely scratched sanity should stay... right,*draw an X* here.
Ya see, EAD is only used in EXTREME cases of... (Trying to think of PG word)

i havent seen him in a while
YOU CANT IGNORE THIS!
Oh my.
Muted channel.
How sad.
/me 4pulls out his code gun
/me 4charges it
People, less spamming, fast-enters and "LOOOOOOOOOL", more actual conversation.
Cool
02Hi~
*gasp*
uh?
what did you...
entertaining
+m
IceMane oh hi
did he ignored everything?
Rainbow Dash
Fluttershy
honestly i wish you tards would stop typic in constant bold like Nero and RandomlyWeir...
Might i ask why RandomlyWeir always speaks in bold?
BEcause i can
cause hes that awesome
because he wants attention
lol pateish xD
gyarados and snorlax are battling
*deal with it*
Therefore the best course of action would be to ignore him
I thought Bold would have been restricted to mods
f
What's going on here?
dammit
ponies
except ponies :P
Pinkie would make even the gloomiest adventure into a fun time
We don't do such restrictions.
Anyone doing fine here?
._.
We are easy going bunch, we are.

Celestia should be the Emperor(ess)

Yupyup

Luna is bad again
11Good idea!
12any pixar film is great
Vader wasn't bad
Watch the movie.
hahaha xD
tbh
I have only seen the first one, I'm not realy the one to talk about SW
Maybe Fluttershy as Chewbacca and Applejack as Lando Calrissian
As she is a chubby pony.
6I actually liked cars
6this second one...
6just
6no
12xD I'm not too bothered about it
12But I can't wait for Monsters inc 2 <3
6I can't talk though
11The template's not quite finished yet, did you know?
I meant as far as character interactions go
Micheal Caine is win
Actualy I agree.

how about the inpossibls
04Roara
trixie = boba fett

5Whoa, I'm distracted.
5Er I was distracted.
on that note i must
pwny...AWWWAAAY!!!
5I probably won't go see Cars 2. I wasn't impressed at /all/ with the first one and the second seems very "lolwut?" to me.
6I loved the first one
6until my family nominated it as the official family movie
6and we watched it over a hundred times in less than two months
5Haha. Well. That happens.
lol
12Favourite pixar movie everyone?
6incredibles, probably
4?
Cars or TS3
Hmm...
5There are too many good ones. D:
Honk.
6toy story 3
Hello and Huzzah, all!
6so yeh, incredibles or TS3
Hello Revolver.
5I really liked Finding Nemo and Up.
12Mine is Monsters Inc =P
11Oh, it's for all ages, by the way
5I loved that one too ^
12Up is probably second, that was a beautiful movie <3
5I SOBBED. o^o
6Up actually scared me a bit lol
5But it was soooo good. <3
12Yes! <3
13BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN THE FIRST ONE YET
5I finally saw /Alien/ for the first time yesterday. xD;
13D:
12The first one wa son TV yesterday
Hi.
SORRY.

i GOT SIDETRACKED.
11The template's coming nicely, by the way! :)
5It was?
13My mum was using the TV yesterday .w.
13I saw it was on though
13We watched Karate Kid instead |D
12Yeah I saw a bit of it, I'm not sure which channel though
6Karate Kid was an awesome movie
Okay.
5D8
5NEVER?
Wait, YOU got sidetracked?
6never
SOeone took my laptop...
Ah-hah hah hah hah hah.
5You mean you've never seen the famous "wax on, wax off" scene!?
13but yeah the remake is <3
5xD;
little sis
5I wasn't too impressed with it.
Now I'm using the main comp
5Unless it's like a planned series or something.
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar.
5It kind of reminds me of going to see a movie based on a book without reading the book first, y'know?
Faaammmiiiineeee
5(Yet another thing I try to avoid.)
13I don't read books |D
5D:
i would join the ponies.
:D
5I read obsessively. xD; It's the only reason my writing doesn't stink completely.
i can't stop talking about TKL
Nice one coz
10 seconds flat
cuz of his name? Coz?
"would"?! SHE IS ALIVE
Coz: Actually, it was exactly 10 secons betwen his hjoining and the /mode +b
5Lol why?
5Because it's pretty much the greatest animated movie EVER?
win
12tkl?
5I misread that as TLK
5xDDDDD
5OOOOPS
12LOL
12Neither do I owo
13Narcoleptic dogs on TV
13;w;
06That's just sad :<
4Thanks
12maybe it was meant to be TLK
The four ponies included are Pinkie, Twilight, Applejack, and Celestia (and spike)
5Maybe.
4Page mode
12xD
5Okay.
Ok
5It really was a groundbreakingly amazing film. <3
So which pony would be which horseman?
12for some reason I enjoyed it's sequel equally with the first movie
*Later* <Ali> *Hurriedly tears down 'All hail Celestia poster*
5Nyeh. It was all right. /shrug
I am going to go
5Really? xD
Soooo, War = Rainbow Dash Conquest = Celestia
5I'm surprised the VHS tape didn't wear out.
Famine= Pinkie Pie
1 more...
Pestilence= Fluttershy
12LOL I was like that with fox and the hound!
Gothya
Nice.
?
Hmmm...
Let's get down to bisness
to defeat
the huns
12and Anastasia <3
No, the carebears
huns = ?
6omg anastasia
12Agreed :3
when i asked for colts
Nero... you never heard of huns before?
Sadly not.
-7
...
/me facehoofs
5I can't say I remember that movie.
do any of you wear horseshoes?
Yep.
/me facehoofes as well
I just found Halo xover fics
facehoofs must hurt
5I saw /The Fighter/ last night too. SUCH AN INCREDIBLE MOVIE. Boxing, yeaaaaaaah~
they really do
Yeah, thats why i don't do them.
5WELTERWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WOOORLD~
5<3
thats why i wear magnets as horseshoes
?
somehow they hurt less...
5Anyone else seen it? It won a few Oscars and was nominated for a bunch more.
6I actually do want to see that one
they use MAGIC
06So see it. Yeah.
5It was really good but it's not exactly for the faint of heart, I'd say.
is there any mormon pony that can explain?
13I haven't even heard of it
13;;
11Same here!
mormons are ok people
Lets not get onto the topic of religion, as it just starts flamewars
terrible people at a bar though
5You should totally check it out.
I just found a Halo/Office fic.
13...Who? |D
Why hello derpybot
6^
Uh oh, derpybot lives
!seen derpybot
Look into my eyes.. 6_9
/me this requires popcorn
6no one said you couldn't
Mail delivered! Thank you for using the Derpy Mail Service 6_9
6we're just talking about other things
!help
o.o
5Well it's not /entirely/ about boxing. A lot of it touches on other things, like family problems, drug abuse, etc.
!seen zekes
noooooooooo
derpy why
why must you leave
she'll be back
5Oh yeah, and Bale was also in 3:10 to Yuma and Terminator Salvation.
13Never heard of any of them .w.
13Yeah I'm very in-the-dark when it comes to movies LOL
4tired
5You could probably find all of those movies in parts there.
6but we're not gonna talk about it all day
5Inb4 ^

5**check
5Hey Damos~
I'm trying to go for 120 stars + all coins in all 15 levels
hey Rolly Polly
It sucks on some levels cuz some coins can fall off the stage
4art for games is always good
/me huggles
i achieved that
4Thats my fav part
4oh and music
roll again
OH right
The ski lift thing
6I got that book the day after it came out
6I'm STILL into it
154 coins get
4Also it shows alot
xD
lol
Just how many coins are there between the 15 levels (and the bonus stages, for that matter?)
6when the 7th book finally came out
6I was in my room
4It seems that they did alot of armor
i don't keep a stable count of how many there are total
just the one's you need 100 for
6yeh
6I was crazy about that book
6I LIVED BY FILTERING FOOD FROM THE AIR
4more then we thought or they added
6no in all seriousness though, it was awesome
6um..
5Mmhm. Ditto there. (Inb4)
6I don't have a favorite character
where
4Looks like they might have had four ready
5I mean "ditto" on that phrase.
Hello hello hello, how are all the fillies and colts today?
oh
sorry
2000 something
5And the one Hyena voiced by WHOOPI GOLDBERG. 8DDD
6I guess it would probably be the hyenna-
6yeh
in all 15 levels it's 2092
5(But she's my hero.)
6I loved that lol
6so much
plus bonus/extra stages and the few in the castle that don't count towards the total, 2672
I think my fav in that movie is zazo
5She is truly awesome. |D
bleargh
zazu*
5So lulzy. xD

Halllllllooooooooo ppl!!!
Collecting all coins, never tried that before. Nice metagame.

The Ultimate Orgy? Yeah, lots of people have said that, I never actually watched it.
And THAT is the kind of quote Fox News wants.
5Never really appealed to me, I don't know. And like I said I don't know it very well.
~_~
oh hold on...can this IRC handle symbols?
6I'm amazed we're discussinf this lol
O.o
6but only the first episodes
Hey Fox news I have a pony waifu and I brush her hair every day also I hate the military and I hate America and Freedom
It can handle ponies.

Also I am on disability and I'm an immigrant

5I don't really watch much TV besides broadcast dramas and a few cable dramas. I haven't seen an animated series in yeeeeears.
I vote democrat!

And born out of a mixed-race family
I vote for Applejack + Rainbow Dash fanfiction.
i lik the origino
Though something I'm surprised I haven't seen yet:
Oh... I have informed opinions of my own, and vote according to policy!
Spikejack
I like Trixie+Twilight.
Thing is, Spike+Applejack actually seems like it could happen.
6TV shows?
Spike's too... Spike.
5^ Yes.
>.>
Plus the show shipped him with Rarity.
xD
O.o
Spike/Apple Bloom?
NCIS is awesome
...
5I like NCIS but I don't watch any of those regularly. xP
6yep
Same here :P
i watch it everythime
6I found the first two seasons at target for 15 bucks each
6had to buy
xD

6so still dunno much aout it
X3
5Roara, I think it's worth checking out.

6WHAT at that last name
:P
5Echevarria?
6my best friend at work, that's his last name
5Really?
∞
5How 'bout that!
I'm OK with shipping. The girls seems roughly college-age, and even if they're not into other fillies, College could lead to more experimentation
6I was JUST talking to him about how i've never ever ever heard that name before
6like, yesterday
6cuz here in my town, we have mainly common names
:/ IJMO
6WEIRD
6anyways
5Yeah, I pretty much idolize R.E. He's a really good writer and has done some epic screenplays.

But no desire to collect the toys or anything.
I'd buy a DvD set of Season 1. X3
Why three times?
I got some of the Brushable ponies the other day

One set is enough.
6I have a ton all to myself
X3 is a face.
5Oohhh. xD
HER MANE'S A FUCKING MESS
wait...
isn't it usually?
5I have to force myself not to eat more than I truly want/need.
Do they have an Applejack toy?
her mane is always a mess
...
Like, by herself?
>.>
yeah
no hat though
unless you get deluxe applejack
or the barn playset
I'd get one of Dash and Jack, but only cause they're my favorites. :P

RD can't be gay. It's against children's show rules.
12This is going to sound really stalkerish
Besides, that's fanon assumption
5So um yeah. But I should probably post in the forums more because I have been a member since freaking FEBRUARY 2007.
I'm just paraspriting
Hello, Logic.
I don't have many posts either

lololololol.
4Oh, haha, I thought people were active in the thread. Well, I feel like a klutz. Oh well, goodbye everybody
You focus on Fluttershy too much.
Lord-Blazer tbh at least the fan-fiction writers break down gender barriers.
No...
Everything is possible with IMAGINATION
You just said Kindness.
:o
12Thats a shame
That's Fluttershy's thing.
Imaginaaaatttion
Leave some for the rest of us.
5(...Or was it two years ago..? I dunno.)
Same here.

5Mmhm.
That would be odd, Snowball, but probably.
12brb, checking on bath
I have no issue.
I wouldn't have an issue
5Sure~
/me 5waits around.
Problom?
But it's the community itself that's labeling her as a lesbian, using very retarded reasoning
And some people that watch this show aren't gay.
SOME people.
SOme...
*Such as myslef*
*Myself*
Okay.
Read the topic guys.
There is nothing wrong
12Okay it's fine, back ^_^
Hey, Not even I would like everyone. some.. *whimspers*
Just saying that the reasoning used is bad
Fireant too far off PG?
5Oh hey, cool.'
hey theyre being very professional about it
We are treading on thin ice gentlement
5I actually have a PM to reply to on the forums, soooooo BRB. xD;
men*
I do, Fireant and this has been a very civil discussion about the show
change of topic is in order
No insults has been thrown around
right i forget, this uses the american definition of PG not the rest of the world.
GentleMentleMen.
12Okay dokey :3
Okay.
I'll try.
Mrph Mmmmmmmmmmrph!
also anything said after my last post I missed.
yea how about using the japanese version of PG?
the one where i said we are in agreement
Why isn't that PG if straight couples can discuss.... whatever. Topic changing
Gentlemen? *packs mouth full of cigarettes*
No Id say using the "Euro-Canadian" definition
Japanese would allow clopping, would it not?
heck
04I just had 8 eggs

oh we're waaaaay past that
current topic: japanese poo steaks
now we're talking about eating poo
This is America.
We can't allow that for some reason.
but seriously
Nightboomfer it's Fireant being sensitive and using the American definition of PG instead of the Euro-Canadian defination
poo steaks
I
Just
threw
up
in
my mouth.
Nightboomfer rules are rules and we have to follow them regardless.
And I hate Lesbians not because they're gay, but because they take all the hot chicks for themselves.
Nightboomfer, overreacting you are, but on other things - I didn't told you to stop the discussion, but reminded gently to keep it withing the borders. Just to be on a safe side here.
omg
JK, I don't hate them.

Whose pony do you like?
You were talking the same year you were born?
Lucas, this implies Slavery.
Again.
Salvery?
hi Quan
preferences aren't by force.
nor action
7Hey, Aero.
WHOSE pony do you like?
Try using "which" instead of "whose"
words are words.
You asked WHOSE.
Sorry, wrong word then.
Is possesive noun.
RD is my favourite.
Fluttershy
*shrugs*
CogWeaver's favourite is Applejack.
Pinkie Pie.
Out of the Mane cast?
7Hmm...
Too close to pick.
Least favorite? Rarity
umm, no
not that I know of
I mean, give me both.
Rarity is awesome.
Still at the bottom of my list.
But awesome.
I dislik her because she is a fashonist and a Drama Queen
Actually, she's at the bottom competing with Fluttershy for fifth place.
Then it's Twilight, followed by Pinkie Pie.
Then, as I said, Fluttershy and Rarity competing for Last.
We realise this.

12It said I had to wait until early july or something
Now then. Back to Pony Touhou.
But that's too much to ask...
haha lati:D
/me is bored*
heh, nice
Yeah, I would probably not have been hooked if I hadn't watched episodes 1 and 2
Really? I prefer the "Slice of Life" episodes.
The CMC episodes have something going for them in that they actually portray the characters as KIDS.
*opens Pony TouHou ZIP*
Rather than miniature but somehow wiser adults.
Lati i said hi
It actually admits that yes, kids are dumb.
I could see that Falcon
12Hi? I swear that says "haha" XD
i saw the first episode first
I haven't actually SEEN that in a show before, as far as I can remember.
didnt like it but i stuck through
I think they're roughly college age

Faust said it herself, they were within the 18-22 range
Equestria Girls was awesome 'cause of the shout-outs. Had me in tears.
:o
thats even worse
it was actually pretty well sung too, honestly (Equestria Girls)
What's worse?
aww
<|:B derp. Selfburn'd.

...i liked equestria girls
*facepalm*
GOOD JOB DRF >:(

no, Fid, she said their ages WERE IN ACTUALLITY 18-22
"Ow, I burnt myself!"

Dusk*
sorry
it's one of the notes or whatever in her DA account
lemme find it
WTF i wanna play pony touhou but it keeps crashing -_-
All we can definitely confirm is that Fluttershy is a year older then pinkie pie
speaking of academic things about the pony.. I don't quite get why Twilight has a seperate singing voice talent
6...XD
Yeah, the animation is the best I've ever seen in a cartoon, Bar none
And Pinkie Pie's birthday is a day after Gummy's
my view of the mane cast is now horrible
They probably record multiple episodes in a row and don't want to damage her voice
atleas we still have derpy

that makes sense Nightboom, she does have a ton of lines

This is probably often asked, but does anyone have any idea when Season 2 is supposed to air?

December.
I thought it was earlier than that, Septemberish
Dang, that's a long time to wait.
But thanks
they have
O.o
What's the process? Do they animate first, or do all of the speaking?
I've been dunking my brain in all this awesome fanon
/me needs to rest for a while...isn't feeling well
and then to go back to canon...
they expected to air the first episode around mid-late october
they may very well screw up things like... Luna

03I totally care about the voices
Lol
Lmao of course drf would say that
12She's not in it, only her voice is
03because the voices suck
03therefore, VAs matter
03and they matter a lot
12It ALL sucks
Subtitles?!
03no way
or I'll just have DerpyBot send you a message
03but yes
Fancy.
03Black and White/Best Wishes/wtf it is
03that show sucks horribly
12They all do
12Pokemon the anime is horrendously bad
03LOL
forgive my very long time away from IRC, but how the heck do you use bold-ding someone.. if that sentence made sense
12No
that's how
and also forgive my lazyness in not just looking it up myself
03disney do you know how to read
Oh the irony
12I just watch it without the sound and skip to the Lugia/Arti bits *runs*
03do you know how to use proper English?
lol
03LOL
Cheater! XD
03first time I've seen them was like yesterdya
03*day
12Well by ages ago I mean like, last week
12and Nick wouldn't let me touch them >v>
03I got to go behind the pit of a NASCAR race today
03:>
12But she's 12
that makes entirely too much sense
!mail Lucas I'll send you a message like this, k?
12No offence but NASCAR means nothing to a Brit LOL
03well
03let me put it this way
Just like how no Americans care about BBC?
:o
12brb sorry
03BBC is cool
I know :>
BBC world news
Ok thnaks
BBC-A ftw
03I want BBC America HD :(
03however
I have it
03it's not really ftw
03because
03PAL to NTSC conversion
03= BAD
I know, PAL X.x
03no
03there's not'hing wrong with PAL
!derp
03But
Slow
:>
03I want the show in its NATIVE format
03HyperMetalLugia
03NTSC is 24fps
03PAL is 24
03*25
and HI ARTI :)
03that whole 30fps thing is just a technical term, movies and the like are 24
woot
ololol
Well how confusing then
the heck is this nonsense?
03yeah
03basically all you need to know is
03original format is the best
wat
03so for BBC, that's PAL. Therefore BBC America, which is NTSC = bad
Including if it is NTSC :P
Congratulations Cog.
You win.
...
But eh, conversion is bad anyway I guess
only pie
!pie
Oh hey it worked.
Much safer :>
Fooby, just type "!help" for assistance on DerpyBot

twentypercetcooler: is it wrong that I imagined Applebloom saying that quote?
