03this being a "Pokémon fansite" is somewhat irrelevant given what goes on here most of the time
true
It'd also be trolling if you go to a <censored> channel and post <censored> sucks
Lols
What did I miss though
Um
You're the only one talking about Family Guy.
almost anything goes in terms of topics
Hello Shaico
Sup Mongoose
although I do say EW to some parts of Pokemon
>.>
like the current TV show
Nick would be Rarity?
03there
03now it's just blocked
03not censored
LOL
03:P
What the f**k
http://youtu.be/Iz9GUIwzCIw - Let's Play StarTropics 01: C-Island
Twilight is Zoey?
Just happened
okay so... this isn't exactly pony related but holy crap: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A2I-Fw_LRc (make a pony video using this cover)
Nah Nick would be Twilight
I didn't even say "m!p"
Sarcastic, Naive
lmfao
Yeah
Nick = Twilight
Lauging at what
03apparently you did
03o.o
No I didn't?
Paste what I said >_>
03OMG IT'S A CONSPIRACY
03YOUR IPOD LIKES THAT SHOW TOO
So, what apout quests
just block: My Little Pony, FiM, and Friendship is Magic :p
OMG no it isn't
03AND IS AUTOCORRECTING TO IT
I mean Coach
...
I just realized that this song fits pinkie pie
No it didn't
03so that you don't realize it
03:P
idk why, they just have likable personalities
03<HSX> It'd also be trolling if you go to a <censored> channel and post <censored> sucks
Please do not swear. You have sworn 2 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
Rochelle and Coach suck
03that's what you said
Coach should be AJ
03:P
I typed NOTHING OF THE F***ING SORT
.
Seems like the most fitting
.............
What the lag
WHO WOULD FLUTTERSHY BE?
03yeah
03that's what happened
Fa
Fail
03thjose like 6 lines came in at once
03I know it's fail
03it's Apple
Bill?
03were you expecting less?
fluttershy = Boomer
lmao
lololol
03or more, IDK the expression
Eh, bill?
Shaico, thanks a lot for the image.
0Insomnia
0i has it
Drf
I wouldn't complain if Fluttershy barfed on me
:)
Ever hear of majority rules)
*?
03I did
03why
lol
That'e why when you're talking about family guy and nobody else cares you're sol
No way
Hey I like Family guy kthx
:P
Trixie = Rochelle
I would, that's not how you treat your goddess.
Rarity is too good for Rochelle
If everyone else likes Family Guy except one person then HE'S sol
Rochelle has no personality, so hard to decide
We are using main characters
so
uhh
Rochelle is kinda bland
Rochelle is a parasprite
Rochelle should be a background pony
Same with you and other people when some other people like some of Gen 5.
So Trixie wouldn't fit her
well, i think Mods do what they want </sucking up but being honest>
:P
03LOL
Thats what I was going to say.
or she, Chime
Derpy?
03anyway
Mods who do that don't deserve to be mods
Main characters guys
03not to mention
Yes I know LL
Come on
no Rochelle has no character
He is faster to type than She
03when's the last time I talked about Family Guy on here before now
032 months ago?
033?
03anyway
By a letter yes xD
Rarity would be who then?
it can't be decided
03I need to go
She?
K
Cya.
Fluttershy woudl be who?
Rarity would be uhhhh
sooner than that
03I might reconnect from my phone
bai
OH i know!
Like we care
>_> if someone is saying im a she then they are wrong :P
/me RUNS!!!
The girl in L4D 1 i forgot her name

Drf makes me think he's a child sometimes :E

Bill would be SPike?

Odly enough that was after I'd started liking MĹP and before they knew me. :P

What just happened?
He is a child >>
DAFUQ JUST HAPPENED
woaj
Lyra is better
Netsplit!
Woah
Retsamoreh: netsplit!
WOOO!
That's a FACT.
Sorry LL :c
They got sent to the moon
So many people left
Yes I love netsplits
Ĺ
Derpy has more personality that Luna
It's how IRC trolls people with bad modems
what is netsplit?
i think Moondust would fit for Nightmare Moon
I don't have any problems with anypony in MLP
At all
at times
Me neither
:|
I literally do not hate anypony
But Luna is overrated
they are all lovable :D
not ALL the time mind
Same
I LOVE ALL OF YOU
Even Snips/Snails?
so its not fact :P
FORCED CUDDLE
The only ponies i dislike is Snips and Snails
Same. They all have good and bad points to me.
Yep even Snips and Snails
But I love them the least
/me forces a group hug between everyone
John316: what we see as one irc channel is supplied by members from many irc servers
awwwww
/me can't breath.
John316: a netsplit occurs when some of those servers disconnect from each other
/me dies from being sucked into the group hug
wat up everyone :D
/me kicks Ivan nuts
hi
Fiiine xD
He acts like a child
/me hugs so tightly it creates a condensed black hole
okay
Ivan nuts sound good.
http://i53.tinypic.com/izmcmb.png LOOK AT ME.
in a non sexual wayu
And has an immature additude to things of his dislike
way*
Better~? :3
Okay
/me lets go
lol
acts spoiled >.>
WAY too often
Hello folks.
hey
hey
hi hi
/me sighs
Ivan nuts
lol i just got that
he's a pain
Yus
but he's MY pain
:c
:P
Rofl
Fire solves all problem
Don't worry, I'm not planning on stealing him from you.
Even a house burning down?
Ooookay xD
He just needs to wise up
Yet.
hey there everypony
yes shaico
Soon.jpg
Because it gets rid of the burning house
The burning house is the problem?
no house no problem
Or is the burning the problem?
Exactly
What if you are thirsy?
The burning stops after the house is burnt down
Wut
pd wat
owo
oh noes, perspective argument
burn it with the lemons
come up with a clever solution to quench my thirst using fire
soz wrong meme
So our solution to a burning building is blowing up the building next to it.
yes
Okay
Hold on
In the end, it's a genius plan.
well you dies and no longer haz thrists!!1!
Alright, I think I know where you're going at.
shaico, if you die in a fire, you are no longer thirsty
Oh, was I saying that out loud?
In the end, Retsamoreh?
Nothing ever ends.
Dammit Steelion
:P
dang
oh sure it does Moro
beat me to it
There is a giant bottle full of water and you use the fire to melt the plastic, thus releasing the water and quenching your thirst
I believe Stephen Hawking defined the begining of time as the first event that influenced the events after it
I want a gummy figurine
so the end of everything would be the last event that influenced anything
So logically we can do stuff
Ok then how about if our goal was to extinguish a fire?
Just not influence ANYTHING
fire would eventually burn itself out with no fuel
sup bronies
Well, Ivan
We ARE in this chatroom here.
no events would follow
heyoooooo
i hate you guys
Deprive it of oxygen.
Wait what?
I hate us too, Shai.
ditto
Love myself, better than you.
What are you talking about MoronSonofborn?
i love you shaico
I LOVE EVERYONE
I love you too Goose.
Somewhat
And I love Lee Carson Jr.
/me does another forced hug
>implying that being in this chatroom is an entirely meaningless activity
That is a lot of love
I tolerate everyone
ditto ^_^
/me uses fire to solve problem.
Hurhurhurhur
Wait what?
0hmmm.
lol
0lets wake up DCD
The problem is your hug
lol Nightboomfer
I DON'T GET IT
Never mind, that went over people's heads
so I burnt your arms
0with ponies
wtf
and you let go
There are two things I hate in this world. People who are ignorant of other peoples cultures and the Dutch.
YAY

Does anyone here like the Miami Heat team?

Oh, well now you have.
I'm from a magical land where Unicorns crap rainbows and Bigfoot is a best selling author.
(:
Florida was ok last I visited, and no, don't care about the Heat
I only like Daytona Beach
Dude I love the Het
and boo uncomfortable clothes
Heat*
Suddnely Mr Poppers penguins has a totally new meaning.
but yay exclusive passes
Suddenly*
Disney World was rather fun.
YOu just said florida sucks....
I read the book when I was little
Florida sucks
But you like Miami Heat?
usually only available to sponsors ;p
kinda glad Lebron got knocked down a peg so he can get some focus
Miami Heat doesn't
Florida is ok
was in a play about it in fact
this is what I was talking about dari http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBVTtaJbMUI
Oh okay then
._.
I was one of the penguins
never read it
I can do this then
aww haha
lol
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT
my mom knows a guy
:|
I think we have pictures of me
If I were to have to chose any one state to send a nuke to, it would have to be Florida though.
Ivan please don't tell me you-
who works for a sponsor
-_-
I hate you
dunno where they are though
Florida is very interesting.
or else I'd show you
as a result I have tickets LOL
Texas!!!!

TEXAS 2!!!
/me twitch.
Norther California.
Don't nuke FL because GA would get hit :C

hi
AW MAN, I am laughing so hard right now

What would a Klondike bar do for itself?

nommuch boi
Everyone is now a parasprite. bzzt
Also, nukes are always fun
No, I'm a Creeper.
heh
not clicking
Nukes are now parasprites.
SssSSsSsSSs
i admit Nowitzki's good, but seriously. he doesn't compare to Wade.
http://memegenerator.net/instance/8297506
That's a nice everything you got there.
Anyone take Nukes seriously though? Ever?
oh is this topic nukes now?
CLICK IT
/me RUNS
Duke Nukem should be taken seriously.
No idea who you are talking about Shaico
And I don't care
I take nukes seriously when you are talking about them seriously.
lololol
Okay back to nukes
/me swears revenge on all dolphins and whales
that's a good answer
no.
Woooo! Spring Break.
As they are currently one of the most powerful weapons in the entire world.
Haha
forget you ocean mammals
wait nukes right?
KOREAN WOOWOWOWOWOW
Lets talk about Nukes seriously and see where it heads.
/me gets John316's reference :)
Thanks
No. Friendship is the most powerful weapon.
Who here thinks Israel has nukes?
/me also get's the reference
anyway I should sleep
bye
I don't - they would have at least tested one if they did
they do and don't
LOL
/me and is lol'ing that he got the reference.
Well, I personally respect nukes in the "The Stand" scenario.
but they are close
(probably)
I loved The Stand.
israel has some borrowed from the states.
and its bombing only.
Some say they worked with South Africa on nukes
Also, on that page.
South Africa did have 6 at one point.
Scroll down a bit.
That's a good point DJ, that makes sense
Look at the first few images.
lmfao
You'll probably know when you see it.
heh Drf isnt that stupid to click a troll link :P
How do you borrow a nuke?
All I know is that North Korea better die soon
although that was 10 years ago. the might now own their own.
/me has been to South Africa before
and sorry, for some reason I was not thinking Isreal - they do I imagine. Iran is what I was thinking of.
North Korea has a few, only a few, nukes now
But that won't last forever
And then I said "Let my people go."
YES hahahahhah!
I got McDonalds to deliver some food to me!
hurhurhur
how?
I just facehoofed so hard. All the new nightmare moon art popping up on Ponibooru and not a single Nightmare Moon account. Screwit, I took it.
i called them
and asked for a delivery
good lord this is an IRC chat, this is the first time I've been in an IRC chat in like... seriously 6 years
israel has 80 apparently...
They got delivery over where I am
and they are their own
sketch, irc is the greatest chat protocol in the world
so not borrowed from the states.
Oh I agree
Well ponies i gotta get goin'
<3 IRC
shows how much I chat, to be honest..
im gonna be going in and out of this chat
We need to kill North Korea
SEE YA TOMORROW
gonna finally finish L.A. Noire
BADLy
and yes
KILL COREA :D
No
We need to Love and Tolerate™ Korea
By we I mean everyone
no
Tolerate the hell out of North Korea ;)
Hit it with a stick!
Seriously, we are techincally still at war with them.
HIT IT WITH A CROWBAR™
LOL
Pinata
Also on that page: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0HZhM_CrSg
John Cleese FTW
I wouldn't have joined EqD chat if it never made the switch to IRC, to be honest
Interesting.
And south korea NEVER even signed an armistice
How I make ~ over my n?
Israel will disarm its nuclear stockpile when there is peace in the middle east.
spanish keyboards only
ñ
ñññ
so pretty much never. but its a nice gesture on their part lol
ÑÑÑÑÑÑÑ
hahhahah.
you mad
That'll never happen. lol
Ñ
hay guise
I imagine I wouldn't stick around if it wasn't Nightmare - but then I haven't used a java chat or something similar in nearly as long
So we don't even need to sign any paper work, just send in the marines or army or whatever
but I remember them being SLOW
Mac keyboards have easy non-English character access
do alt codes work here
Yes they do, John
North Korea better die by the time I am dead
yes Θ
Plugin based chats are simply awful, sketch.
Simply AWFUL~
Nightmare_Moon: I could have shown you how to use normal IRC w/ EWC :p
I just imagined Rarity as a software designer
I believe it, glitchy, laggy.. etc
Wouldn't fix the crashing 3x days
I lost a little respect for John Cleese when he said he was "too busy" to help write a sketch with the Whitest Kids U' Know.
How to kill north korea, discuss
[zZz]ekeS, no. Java based, flashed based and other nonsense based plugins are terrible terrible things.
I cannot get my mind to wrap around rarity designing software
No let's not Ivan
Fine...
They have memory leaks incredibly impressive for a plaintext based application.
regedit
+rarity
I don't know what that is.
Thread by thread, coding it together
Well I'm tired.
/me fails at code
Also that actually works

well.. at least her code might be legible. Linebreaks and commented nicely

Yet he won't help out an up-and-coming generation that started out just like him.
Comment line, perfect documentation saves you time
Hmm.
hi
...yay.
the only coding I know is visual basic and I use it for excel spreadsheet calculations. like the time i wrote a macro to calculate derivatives and such
which I'm sure is why my C++ teacher liked to take off so many points for sloppy looking code and poor documentation.... O.o
4Skylanders needs armor
I doubt I know any coding anymore. Like any language... if you don't use it.. etc.. etc
Checking in another project file, step outside, this sync might take a while
Haha no
4Why?
Mind those specification details, even though she's more concerned with sales
um.. so anyway, since this chat seems to have slowed... Nukes right? Yeah.. they... :)
Always bet on the duke
there is a captain planet character named Duke Nukem
Really? lol, cool
What?
yep
I mean cool in the probably geekiest/ 90's cartoon way
http://img192.imageshack.us/img192/7862/dukenukemmosc1a.jpg
Which is why it's Duke NukEm now instead of Duke NukUm like in the very forst gane
heh, crazy
I don't like the game at all.
Duke Nukem forever is a huge dissapointment
But it IS huge, yes?
MONKEY PAW!!!
Ehhhhhhhhh
I kinda want to play it.. I don't expect the graphics to be any good
or really the engine to be at all solie
>>solid
it's repetive
and boring
but I kinda want there to be a humor and feel that brings it back to Duke 3d days
but I've heard the same Shaico - kinda a shame
/me should have known better than to wish for the release of Duke Nukem forever using the magic monkey paw
yeah. i liked the opening a bit
you could control your piss and stuff
so true John
but the rest of the game bored me
PAAAAWWWWWW!
lol

Pfft, I'd hate to image what she would do if she saw you with a Pinkie Pie brushable
I'll just pretend she's avoiding Gummy's after birthday party

eh, you should just sing the theme while brushing it, it's fine ;)
I'm considering getting a full on pinkie pie plushie to replace my dear rare
I have enough nerd credit to get away with liking whateva

what, and invoke the beast called Pinkamena
When does the garbageman come?
without people thinking its strange for me
My parents still cant' believe I watch 'a show for little girls' They're fooling themselves if they think that's all it is.
18 weeks
god damn
:O
almost 19 weeks

If he hasn't come yet, the trash can probably hasn;t been emptied yet
That was the spambot attack though

Hmm people have stopped posting
Man US media. is fracked.

the lies, drivel, and bile they can spit out aggrivates me
Nightmare_Moon: :\
Ahahah this netsplit is causing a huge amount of lag too it would seem
and im looking from the outside in fyi.(another radio show has blasted the fandom)
*gasp* another one fails to understand or do reasearch, i'm Shocked
just no one posts back
I wanna go to the doctor right fucking now

:(
I hope you feel better soon
sdagasg

I don't wanna be sick for aiden I just I can't no ;___;
I will cry if I am I need to breathe while I get pushed and if I can't breathe through my motherfucking stuffed up nose I'm SCREWED
yo
woah, tons of posts in like a fraction of a second!
These servers don't handle netsplit too well do they?
Can anyone hear me still? raise a hoof if you can
I'm...seeing this o.o That was interesting...
People are shallow, sensationalist cads who operate on sweeping assumptions and ill-formed opinions
/me is alone in here
hey buddy
Sure MoronSonofBoron, but a person is not :)
gah
/me so alone on his side of the netsplit
/me raises a hoof in response, belatedly.
pushed like in a mosh pit?
6Look! A parasprite! :p
yes
D:
but but
:(
seattle crowds are fucking wild no matter where I go
i guess you havnt noticed me at all then haha
6If you're going to use the name, expect to be called one.
ha, I can beleive it
and aiden gets fairly rough I need to cling onto my spot during wall of death so I don't die
6I noticed you right away.
6You've been nickchanging all day.
ok then :(
D:
xDD
6It's my job to watch the chat, sillyfilly.
I'd be terrified in a place like that
I get nervous in malls...
...XD really?
Mr sprinkles i do have to say that i have enjoyed your stream for the past...
hmm
I'm not good with people
yes
or crowds I should say
MY LIFE http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwbMtL-dz1A
where I grew up there's no such thing as a crowd
ever
6Over 24 hours. Except the short 5 hour break I took. And then the end now.
yessir i have been enjoying it ever since
except this morning
I love mosh pits. XD
actually now that I look at that video I've seen better wod videos of their shows
are YOU gonna stream next week? :D
but I've seen aiden 8 mil times so I'm used to their regular activities they do this every show
We had 2 wall of deaths when my friend was playing with his band somewhere.
6I'll likely do Saturday, I think.
there was only one show that they didn't do it at and I think it was because it wasn't very crowded
nasjdgkasg
ill be there
6But I'm pretty sure DCD is doing Friday.
ahaha
Someone spilt water all over the floor so everyone was nearly falling over/falling over all the time. XD
well then..today and yesterday was fun
ill see you next week :D
XD
6Of course.
cya~
this video looks better
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYDrb7cJhOI
6G'night.
I never participate but it's amazing to watch in person, I usually try to get front row spots so I turn around and watch
D: that looks scary as ****
Lawl, it's fun.
Some guy stood right in the centre just beforehand.
So we crushed him. (:
XD dari is hardcore
Haha, hardly. XD
The guy who went to stand in the middle was.
:P
yeahh
aiden is the only band I usually see that does wod's though
MY DREAM IS TO CROWDSURF ONE DAY
/shot
Hahaha. XD That'd be cool.
omg so
when I saw snowing a week or two ago
there's no stage no barrier
and I got shoved right into the singer dude
hullo
LOL. XD
I had to move I was worried that if I kept getting pushed into them I'd fuck up their sound or equipment
;o
o.o
I have a pic on my cellphone one minute I'll link it
it's like just the dude's head
and nothing else
Well I got booted the first time, so I had to see if it would happnen again
http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/246835_1785419201242_1412375489_31619858_7524022_n.jpg
Wow, that's pretty close. XD
:d
:3
yes that was crazy
that was a really cool venue too
it was like
just a basement
lol
I swear someone that worked there lives there
I've seen one totally underground venue.
That was pretty cool.
when I filmed for algernon cadwallader after snowing's set I was in the back standing on the back of a couch leaning against a mattress
and there were like bike parts scattered all over the place and before the venue they were serving homemade tacos or w/e
;o
Lol, wth.
4SIRSPRINKLES!
http://www.last.fm/music/Algernon+Cadwallader/+images/41850837
not from the same show but that's pretty much what it looked like
6 foot tall teenage boys > small female that just wants to film
:C
:o
Filming must be difficult.
depends on the venue and the people
fuck
Looks fun though.
I don't usually film every show I go to
I hate when I leave my scrollback up
._.
like a few hours
lmao
I mostly film a band called me vs myself who i've made a couple videos for and I'm starting to film other local friends as they begin to play more shows
other than that it's just random whether I decide to or not
grabbing and strumming are entirely different levels of articulation though
Just discovered a precursor to Nintendo Wars
so is manipulating a bow for the strings and strumming, lol
They're still selling it too
I'd give an arm to go and see CoB, that'd be so damn awesome.
but it is interesting to think about
http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/452/Battle+Isle+2.html
who
strumming would be easier for the pony
theoretically
Children of Bodom.
Looks great but I'm not buying
ah
12don't stare at me D:
I guess strumming wouldn't be that hard.. managing the frets though? I guess no harder then on cello
/me stares
no, easier
.-.
because you wouldn't have to be as precise with the fingerings
cello and other non-fretted instruments require you to be RIGHT on the point in order to produce the in-tune note
Are they too heavy for your taste?
makes sense
hmm
yeahh from what I've heard
so theoretically I suppose, yeah, easier
I listen to a lot of different things but that's not really my area
Ah right.
Rage Against The Machine, or Bullet For My Valentine?
I have a slight obsession with wings, so my OCpony would have to be a pegasus, but I play bass guitar so that of course is part of it
Thanks for the aid :)
Fuck OC
if I had to choose an altogether favorite genre it would be late 90's/early 00's "emo"
nahh
well its like asking how rarity can get pruny hooves from staying in the bath too long
;_;
good evening, equestria
evenin
true
konbanwa
twas a funny joke tho
just listened to the npr thingy
blarg
....
I love that episode... oh there was an NPR thing?
All this media stuff isn't that big a deal.
not angry, just annoyed that its once again the MOM'S BASEMENT jokes
Yep, NPR bashing
That's how it is with all things internet-related
meh, haters gonna hate
But it was probably a local affiliate
fyck i know dapples
Anything ever. *shrug*
6Yes?
I actually listen to npr more than any radio station, and i've always liked wait wait
4Sup?
Looked that way from the transcript AgnitioExMachina
6Not much
yep
certainly better than that stupid whatdya know program
4Cool
Ok, thanks.
It's either homophobia, reactionist THEY MUST BE PEODS, Moms basement jokes, Unemployment joke.
4So how do you think the stream went?
dapples, relax, it's some local retards doing an opinion section
as for me, I like folk/indie rock sort of stuff
Yep
4Earlier today, I mean
6Good, except for the LAG
same
4How was the lag in ST this time?
but I like tons of other music too
ah, I should go check out the EqD homepage for updates. brb
Was I banned or did I have a bad internet connection because if I was banned then I am truly genuinely sorry and would somepony please tell me what I did wrong so I don't continue to do it?
the unemplyment thing bothered me actually. I don't think I was tempted to quit my job to obsess over anything
that's just what I like the most
exactly haha
Real NPR reporters actually know that there are more bizarre things that isn't worth bashing
6It was about as bad as after I had fixed it last time.
Nightbooomfer: it was a netsplit not worries
4Man
chat was just glitched
Night, it's the chat
i'm not deeply offended or anything
yep
What a shame.
you have pony music?
I'm more worried about the comments section about the NPR thing.
Okie dokie loki
awesome!
6Though some ponies think it kinda added to the video, so that's funny.
Fon Shaolin's back. -.-
4Hey, it's Turni
TBH the homophobia is aggrivating the heck out of me and shows how muche the USA has issues with gender identity. In canada we pretty much don't give a fuck about tomboys nor do we care about sensitive men.
6SUDDENLY TURNIBRONY OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE!
its just obnoxious when things you like cross and one has to say something about the other
XD
I remember that guy back from the "Open Letter to the Brony Community" post.
Allways.
/me jane316
Guy's a crazy-good troll.
4So, Turni, do I dare ask if you're finally satisfied with how we run the BMN?
Nightboomfer chat just had connection issues.
i was talking to a friend recently about how ridiculous is it that girls can like transformers but guys can't like ponies
I actually do have gender identity issues. It's completely unrelated to my pony love. and who is hating on us now?
Which guy?
Do you?
Nightboomfer NPR radio
no one's hating on us, just the usual durr hurr nerds thing
0time for chat.
4...that's a good question, Sprinkles?
I have no gender identification issues
I'm pretty confident I'm a man, but hey, MLP has a great world and characters
so
*shrug*
that and the art style is <3
whoa whoa.. npr thing.. crazy... must go find
I'm actually a pretty good example of a man liking a cutesy show
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/npr-bronies-and-great-and-powerful.html
/me is secure
I never really had a problem. Just had a problem with some of the movies. :P
6XD
I'm pretty confident I'm a woman, but I'm not girly by any means, and I'm secure in that too.
Nor do I, my girlfriend and friends know im a fan of the series. there response was OHU. because they know im quirky so it didn't surprise them
4Well, I'm glad that everybody is finally happy...to an extent
Music you have in common includes MANSIONS, Aiden, Circa Survive, Anarbor and The Swellers.
my fiancee teases me about it, but she doesn't really care
Actually went out and bought Starship Troopers afterwards because I really liked it.
I saw the swellers a month or two ago with bayside
My girlfriend is okay with the idea
I am gradually converting my friends to pony
Woah, cool
People can think and say what they want about us. I couldn't care less.
...in fact I've seen all listed bands live
ahahah
I got my boyfriend into MLP. And at least one of my friends.
I'm not exactly the "manliest" guy anyway
I think I only have one song of theirs
F*ck stereotypical gender.
I weight train fyi
lol
Srsly.
4I have to say, I was thoroughly entertained the entire time I watched it and I hate Sci-Fi/Action combinations
How's the saying go? "Love and tolerate the sh*t outta them."
It's getting tougher to love and tolertate everyone...
I actually want to wegith train
I'm sick of my damn gut
It's always tought, boomfer
i'm trying. its very tough
tough*
cyril, you'd need more than just weight training btw
i've spent my whole life convinced everyone is an asshole
But that's the point, kinda.
Weight training only increases metabolism
which is why this fandom appeals to me. i'm sick of being so negative
aerobic exercise burns calories
Even if I'd still debate over that whole "picked as a B-movie" thing. But was too entranced by the chat.
and fat
Negativity is more work
Agnito: well if I weight train I'd shift my entire diet and stuff
also, cardio is necessary
But weight training only speeds up your digestion and shit
All i ever do is run
6I could see B-movie due to some of the acting, not much else.
yeah, weight training will not really help with weight loss immedietely, it'll actually bulk you first
No shit cardio is neccessary lol
for exercise
I do the bodybuildling method of weight trainging
so like
yea
sketch, which is one reason why I picked weight training
The show has actually helped me evaluate how I see my friends and now I really do try to see the good in everything
I mean. It isn't much diffrent than your regular Hollywood blockbuster.
4It was pretty damn hammy
is running alone okay for exercise?
:)
MANLY FUCKING SQUATS
SQUATSSS
lol
oh god
Boomfer: I think that's awesome.
HHHNNNNNGGGG
Agnitio: LOL\
My equipment is in teh basement
and like, I have to crall up after a good session
yeah, if that's what you are after, for sure
Urgh, exercise.
And last time I checked. The "B" in B-Movie didn't stand for "blockbuster with a million dollar budget" :P
for real
I also haul wood
*crawl
6Especially DAT DEATH SCENE
Since I am in the middle of nowhere
4JOHNNY I'M DYING
I just eat healthy and walk everywhere, that's my exercise.
more like a forest
4JOHNNY I'M DYING
yea, that would be good
4JOHNNY
except I don't
4I'M DYING
so I need to like... burn calories
6AND IT FLEW REAL LOW
but as far as weight management.. I used to run about 5-7 miles every few days.. key word.. used to
I walk everythwere too. Not having a car has its advantages
^ I love you
heh
I aslso work at a bagel shop
baagel
bagel
FREE BAGELS
lol
bageel
/me has a desk job and little time for exercise
yes.
and I swear.. you do that and you can eat anything you want.. as much of it.. all the time..a nd not gain anything
4That one scene made it B worthy in my opinion *nodnod*
Free bagels
I work at a place that sells cookies, caked, and brownies
Yup! Not paying for gas, for one.
I know benefits lol'd
I decorate cakes and stuff
The stream didn't do justice to the effects either. :P
Whhhhaaat? Sweet!
Huh.
also free cookies
Hi.
I do enjoy sweets every now and again
And it flew real low...
i could not work at a bagel place
bagellls
Nothing wrong with that
i would weigh a million pounds
haha
lol
mmm bagels
Bag Gel.
A million pounds vs. free bagels? Worth it.
I am like Fluttershy with Pinkie Pie's job
Still sound good?
0JOHNNY I'M DYING is best death scene
nice mongoose
why do seagulls fly over the sea?
NEW TOPIC: Bronies In The Media
bagels with strawberry cream cheese, BAM\
Jane, to get to the other side
Community?
dohoho
I put my gel in this bag
Ridley, you missed when that WAS the topic :P
6Well EXCUUUUUUUUUUSE MEEEEEEEE for getting the HD version when it was the only one I could find.
Because if they flew over the bay they'd be bagulls
D'oh
6We don't pirate here.
lol
Bagels
Ah well. It sorta makes me a sad pony.
Yarr
I understand *hug*
We don't?
Ok.
haha
0I don't?
baygulls
I'
silly
Eventually, I think they'll get tired of it and we can continue in peace. After all, there are entire communities of adult male barbie doll collectors
I'm like pinkie pie with pinkie pies job
6Not if we have the ability not to.
:3 Thanks.
But the thing is, journalism is full of crazytalk, and y'can't let it get you down/
yes
except bagels
Backgal
Back gal
4YAR HAR FIDDLE DEE DEE
so, is this NPR thing like a "you should check this out" or is it a bunch of "huuurrr duuuur geeeeks" kinda thing?
So you bought it?
It was really the lag that did it in. ;P
why were the little strawberries crying?
6It was via sites you sign up for.
Because they were in a jam
NPR probably wasn't either
http://www.npr.org/2011/06/18/137261565/bluff-the-listener
6The lag was because it was HD.
There's the transcript.
not... loading
argh
I'm going to try and download this game
http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/972/Gloriana.html
Hope you can find Dead Heat. Because one day...
I just lost a friend from childhood cause of my love for mlp, pretty awesome, you are close friends with a guy since the age of 7, and 12 years later, he finds out I like mlp, and he is like: Wow, you're pathetic, were not friends anymore
It's a bunch of trashing, sketch
> . >
I don't count it as real NPR reporting
Are you serious? D:
4Turni's all about that Dead Heat, I've seen him talk about it in almost every thread and stream XD
That's no good, twentypercentcooler
twentypercentcooler: how shallow
Sprry dood
thats too bad
Allways.
sadness... how could a friend of yours hate you for having a hobby
twentypercent, just tell him that if he can't handle new ideas
I'm sorry man
Your friend's just like Gilda. :l
*sad
yeah he raged on me for like 10 minutes then left
he shouldn't even try new things
>_>
Did you spam him with ponies?
It's the best undead-buddy-action cop movie I've ever seen.
that can annoy people
So once he's cooled off, make him watch
haha, nah
Anyways I'm charasmatic enough not to worry about that shit
I don't see how your personal choice in hobbies has anything to do with him, or how it would make him rage *hugs*
okay, well hope he cools off and doesn't keep being such a bucket
And one less "friend", fine with me
it is interesting to hate someone because of an isolated hobby.. and pretty weak
got plenty of "friends"
thanks for the transcript by the by
4undead buddy action cop movie?
I'm too zany for people to care
lol u guys r forever alone
4So it's like Rush Hour...but with zombies?
even my GF was like "and?"
/me doesn't worry about losing friends he doesn't have
:P
Of course, you can always get new friends, Pinkie-Pie style.
sketch: Not a problem
Pfft. It's better than Rush Hour. :p
well, one thing I have realized, is that he tries to act like some big macho guy, and he always forced me to wear certain clothing and look a certain way when he and a few other friends went out places
Got a bag of flour sitting around? How about some rocks?
4Hey, Rush Hour was good
some big issue on his own self image, now he sees me as a threat to that I guess
That really says a lot about him
Rush Hour didn't have Vincent Price.
twenty, well looks like he had a self image problem, then
>_>
tbh If thats all it took for him to stop being friends with you. he wasn't a good friend to start with.
That's sad. He NEEDS some friendship
sorry to be mean, but he sounds like a tool
But it had Jackie Chan.
no offense to your friend, but honestly f that guy
:P
un tool him
4>doesn't know who Vincent Price is
Or undead.
lol
yeah
I have friends who are working for politicians and they didn't give a fuck when i told them i liked MLP.
Like I said:
Such a Gilda
Nah, he's not confident in his manhood
That's basically it
i understand not getting it
4And yeah, it had the smiling Jackie Chan who just wants no trouble from anyone
He's not straight enough
-snrk- manhood
well they found it odd and went "lol serious?" but yeah
lol
To understand being secure in it
but actively rejecting your friendship because of it, that's nonsense
maidenhood?
right
In a groundbreaking role.
It'll die down!
I hope...
maidenhood makes me think of bad fanfics I read when I was younger
oh boy
wait.... what movie are we talking about?
I can joke about being a faggot but I know what I am and still get lolz
what fails is that another friend of mine (also good friends with thi guy) is fine with me watching mlp, BUT....Around him, he sides with tool friend and joins in the rage, > . >
4Rush Hour
lol twenty, you in middle school?
But yeah, I liked Rush Hour.
or some shit? lol
the difference is ide
Im in College bro, XD
from man
/me slaps Ray
I'm in college too brah
4But hey, at least we get to see Se7en
I know right? childish behavior on their part
4next week
That's ridiculous :l
Yes you can Ridley
But I don't know about any guys that act like they're in middle school
Which I hadn't heard of until today, lol.
Highschool maybe
joooin usssss
Fuckers text in class lol
College eh?
i love how your friend is basically gilda
YOU'RE DORKING UP THE SKY TWENTYPERCENT
EXACTLY
I don't even have middle school where I'm from lol
But the fuck do I care?
I've gotten lucky so far. Someone saw my Fluttershy background on my phone and said "...really? REALLY!?"
Love to all, though I know you little. G'night bronies! I'm sorry I stayed away for a month
Se7en is good.
It's their problems
"Just... just... why?"
see ya Ridley
And I said "why not?"
Still, I bet if I realed off "MUST SEE" films for long enough, you guys wouldn't have seen them all. :P
And then we've stopped discussing it since.
adios ridley
Bye Ridley!
And then there was new Nightmare Moon art http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25866
G'niGHT RIDLEY
:D
man
reeled*
my best friend's wife has linked me to the equestria girls vid
Oh really?
I'm going to wear a twilight sparkle shirt to comic-con in san diego
I hate when people do that
4Must See?
Nightmare_Moon .. tis good
tis real good
4List em
Yeah, you're probably right.
so she's at least mildly amused by my interests
Argh, jealous
...
aww
Today was awesome though, I had a punch of MLP art drawings with me at church, and everyone thought it was awesome and there was not one negative comment on me liking mlp, so YAY
Try us I guess.
XD
I didn't have a list of movies in mind.
I wish I could go to the San Diego con
I have a fiend who has said he specifically hates "cute girly things" but he still loves me and invites me to stuff. I spam ponies sometimes as a joke to annoy him, but he has no problem with me as a person. That's how I know he's my real friend
4>_<
ugh yes
I live in San Diego
4Just toss out some
-Your faithful student twilight sparkle
Find one.
OH
I get them from the most random fucking people too
and I will also be in Dr Zoidburg costume
a FIEND
Nightmare_Moon: watched kloudmutt draw that on his livestream tonitr :p
If you pay for your own ticket and shit and pay for room and board
I love that typo
I'm going to Dragon*Con this year
heh sorry i didnt go back there after my laptop BSoD'd XD

I get requests like that too
a convention in Atlanta, GA
The Usual Suspects
so are we not getting a season one dvd?
Entry badge
so he can go in?
Check
I hate flash streams. flash in and of itself has this huge memory leak problem and is prone to lag. Nothing that QT streams suffer from
ahh
from people I haven't seen since I was tiny
Anyways I also know guys who've volunteered at Comicon and shit
I've never gone to it though
I'll be going to the FanExpo in Toronto in August, but that's about it.
seems like a waste of time to me
My bf and I get free passes
What does? The con?
I live in texas so there are cons all the time w/o travel
4I may have seen it...maybe
or little ten year olds who ride my mom's bus
ugh
I do not know you!
Lol, the first film I say and you're not sure.
Wait, you're a chick? Disregard my invitation
some girl that I used to go to school with was arguing with me on myspace a few years ago and a few months ago she was trying to add me on facebook and I'm just like LOLNOPE
I never have
hahaha
lol
I could be a gay man.
Sorry but girls are too much fucking trouble
girls who like ponies?
You COULD be but
I know eh? shock
wtf
who is?
girls with ponies
Mod status instantly revoked. ;P
XD KARMA
Hahaha.
I tolerate homosexuals
Hey guys: If you want my little pony stuff, use the code MLPTEN on HasbroToyshop.com
Enter the Dragon (Bruce Lee FTW)
TOLERATE being the keyword
just found this out
ponies or gtfo
I adore homosexuals.
I don't know why there's such a big deal about people getting harrassed on facebook by their schoolmates...IF THEY'RE BEING RUDE JUST DEFRIEND THEM GOSH DON'T BE A PUSSY ABOUT IT
Pass
girls who like ponies? <- lol they happen
But then, I'm biased
I figured you'd want to know
You've never seen it?
e
Wow.
yeah
hey guise
4I've seen it
HAI GUIZE
Oddly enough, my girlfriend is not a fan
then again she's not huge into cartoons
I'm not big on martial arts flicks. :P
hi lolwutman
mine either, cyril
Although I support equal rights for those of a...different sexual preference
But...BRUCE LEE!
Fancy that!
I wouldn't want to live with one
...yay
Just me.
It's an acquired taste - cartoons I mean
:(
or a taste from childhood
Groundhog Day
my wife is (and don't think I'm creepy old by that statment, we are both in our 20's
where does asexuality fit in?
Yes.
4Nope
did I ever tell you about the time when I was going through deleting all my friends who I didn't even know, and then one of them adds me again and sends me a message "weren't we friends on here once?"
your wife is what? a fan?
B B B BUT SHES THREATENING TO HAVE S3X W/ MY BF THAT I'VE BEEN GOING OUT WITH 4 1 WEEK AND WE'RE MEANT TO BE WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO???? stop being a whiny little bitch and get over it?
>>is a fan that is
indeed
asexuality-not intrested in fucking at all
XD no you didn't
eh?
i have friends like that
right
You should see it. It's really good.
..
I'm somewhat asexual
sketch, heh
XD exactly
Yeah, it's good.
:P
Just not that great
I used to think I was asexual
Well Agnitio, I'd rather tolerate/somewhat support than hate
but yeah, she was a classmate of mine who I never really talked to much
i don't get it, but if I weren't in a committed relationship i'd probably be a huge slut
4Seen it
asexuality is crap.
Yeah, I tolerate and somewhat support
Seen that.
*cough*
who hasn't
amusingly enough, I'm bisexual, or was before I was married.. I suppose I'm functionally straight now
if you are going to mencin asexuality go to after dark
SHE'S CALLING ME MEAN THINGS AND I'M INCAPABLE OF CLICKING THE "UNFRIEND" OR THE "BLOCK" BUTTON BECAUSE I'M STUUUUPID
Erm. Me.
You serious Turni?
lol
asexuality is.. interesting to me
NO WAY! O_o
Eyup.
in an academic way
oh good lord
or another translation
you have to watch it!
I'm pansexual. Like Jack Harkness level.
I JUST WANT EVERYONE'S ATTENTION
i support all sexualities(striaght here)
this topic is now after dark?
4Actually, I've only seen snippets of it
yeah
i don't really understand pansexuality? explain?
DEFEND ME
think of the gigantic twinkies!
See?
lol "look at that.. it's beautiful." "jack... that's a poodle"
What?
not really
BE AT MY EVERY BECK AND CALL PLEASE :'(((((
O__________________o
pansexuality = attraction/potential to love any gender
Anyways I'm about to try the game Gloriana on DosBox
they are not talking about detil
lol
how is that different than bisexuality?
isn't that bisexuality?
hey so
detail
Pan such a crazy goddess
I like boys, girls, gender-fluid, transgender, genderqueer, intersexed
pansexuality..... _>
etc
Ponies?
on these question answer things that this guy put on your page
The film is older than me and I've seen it.
4Dan's been in better films
New topic Ponies.
4Akroyd
should I put a comment on one of them going BILLY LUV CHAS
4Steroids
4guy
4man
just to see what happens
4person
Yep
Hi there Balloons
uhhhh
whereas nightboomfer has it right in that pan is more than just biary
binary*
XD
Yeah lets talk about ponies
Like Trading Places?
or is that one of your actual friends
Hello Fooby
I just deleted them all
:P
Discuss Roman and Greek gods
oh XD
sooo yes, ponies
so ponies are pony-rific
Lets float
this guy actually is
wat
4Exactly, AND the one movie with David Spade
ponies yay
his name isn't billy though
PRIMUS FTW
4Tommy Boy
so heres something I wonder
lol alright then
cyrilthepony mine either, but she is more tv sitcoms then cartoons. although she wants me to take her to an anime convention badly xD
did I get muted?
opinions on the hardest pony to draw?
he was always a... troublemaker
pony-tastic
B00LLY
Haven't seen that.
I'm curious on that one actually
Fluttershy, her parents named her fluttershy, but.....
'cause Rainbow dash gives me trouble
what if she wasnt shy?
I wonder if he's hiding from someone so's using a different name
did her parents somehow know she would be shy?
Celestia is the hardest I think.
DJMidli hahaa! that's hilarious to me. My GF rather stay away from my convensions haha
troll account
:P
What if they named her flutterbold, lol
ah, that would be a hard one, could agree there Destroyer
Haha, or maybe that too
never attempted it (yet) I'm sure it'll be a pain
I dunno though
it was a self fulfilling proficy
hmmm
he also wasn't always the brightest bulb...
ncie
:3
*nice
*shuttefly I mean
but deep down he was a good guy
maybe they get a unicorn to see le future for every childpony
cyrilthepony im gonna kill two birds and invite her to the convention im spinning at xD
I want to go to a rave some day
even if he did do dumb things sometimes
it is interesting that their names are sorta prophetic
Rainbow Dash always dresses in style!
Never seen Trading Places.
OH GOD NOT G1
Or Tommy Boy.
Fooby you should they are loads of fun :3
I am a glowsticker but have never been to a rave, haha
makes me wonder if they don't get their names until thier personality develops
Djmidli: sweet! I was wondering if you were a legit DJ or not haha
your new pony name is... DiesHorribly
But it's a classic.
:P
why are teenagers stupid
I wish Solo shows were easier for non-djs :<
No, the film.
4Oh
>Implying games based on movies are any good
4Meh
because they have too many hormones and if they don't know how to control them it ends up killing their brain
Jean, that's kind of a hilarious name in it's implications.
...does that say "Not" Spike or "Hot" Spike?
4>goes off to find a list of movie-based games
im a dj, but not rly that famous
I'll actually rephrase that
I could see how her parents would name her Rainbow Dash after seeting her mane
Besides Jurrasic Park.
/me stole the name from the comic Goblins
Kinda hard to be a famous dj.
eyup
and Twilight Sparkle is probably named after her mother
eyup
Competition and whatnot.
cyrilthepony I am indeed a legit DJ. i spin for anime conventions. http://www.megaupload.com/?d=V80ZM7TF
lol
why are teenage girls so stupid that they think everyone is going to treat them like a princess and they're worried about being alone forever if they're not with someone at age 16
the genesis one?
why
why are they all stupid
Yup
i actually like playing as the raptor
it was awsome
now imma wondering if i should change my stage name to vinyl scratch
4SAw
4Saw
yeah, in that case I never knew
legaly?
DJmidli: Nice, cool beans :)
Which makes me wonder if Twilight Sparkle's dad is named "Sparkle" or som ething
or nick
have you played the sequel to that game? it's really wierd
4was fun, I actually really enjoyed Saw
teenagers always confused me in that way
and you can double jump...
I don't think it's a last-name situation.
*high fives DJmidli*
I was the forever alone type back then
Sequal was really fun too.
/me is reading dumb little teenage girl tumblr blogs about how awful their life is because they don't have a boyfriend that will sacrifice fucking EVERYTHING for them
why does Rarity have no last name? haha
but nobody ever knew because I never talked about it or whined about it
4Oh, and Goldeneye
yeah
4Goldeneye is the classic exampl.e
or secondary name, whatever
4*example
Cuz she's too rare
/me brohoofs lolwutman
I WANT MY BF 2 GIVE ME HIS COAT IN -20 DEGREE WEATHER
hoihoihoihoih
i also like agent under fire
haha
I wouldn't know.
=(
3 syable rule.
maybe she does but never mentions it outside of legal documents
except to you guys
I'm also the guy who did the MLP:FiM panel at Anime North ^^
Would the same be said of Fluttershy or Applejack?
b/c you guys are my bffs
ohhh
4Eh, I didn't like Goldeneye either
true
How many examples does it take to exceed "the exception that proves the rule"?
cool
:D
Applejack Apple?
:D at being your bff
4As many as needed?
oh wait, thats right
infinite
They never officially say that.
Atleast 9000
MLP is definitely not popular where im at
Nice and specific.
well, apple family, apparently
so far, i only know 3 other bronies in my country
or extreemly vauge
Anime north! No shit.
:P
not at you feeling like I used to
I keep wishing I'd gone to that.
eyyup
yeah I know
:P
Starship Trooper had a game based on it.
not a big anime fan, but okay
Halo. ;P
I may be derpy but I'm not insensitive
:P
XD
the derpiness comes with being a dude
we're all a bit dumb
more netsplits?
I live about 45 minutes outside of Toronto, but I'm not into anime, so this is a problem lol.
4Hah, Halo
Emotional depth of a teaspoon.
i love halo
yep
yes netsplits
:P
/me remembers that line from Harry Potter. XD
=D its always been good to me
me too dari
it's true though
Haha, yeah.
Eh back
guys only have like one emotion at a time
XD
until microsoft stopped hosting the halo 2 servers...

for now
hai
wb
bwahaha
Good games. Had fun completing them with a friend.
girls can be feeling tons of things at once
well at least i was part of the final 16
ohai Obsi
4Eh, strokes for different folks
will MLP be at CCI?
Ah well, there will be other T.O. meets.
Never played Halo.
oh there's another thing I hate about teenage girls, they're all like Y DOES NO BOY WANT ME BAWWWWW IM UGLY but the next thing they say is ALL BOYS R PIGS DAT WANT 2 HAVE SEX THEN DUMP U!!!!!!!
Strokes for diffrent folks. That's what she said.
>_>
it's like SHUT UP YOU'RE STUPID
Of course I can't without an Xbox.
with guys, we're either hungry, mad, or thinking about some stupid trivial thing
yeah that'll do it prince
4There actually was a Starship Troopers game XD
I plan on making a Derpy costume for Dragon Con and just photobombing everything
Really?
so what is ur favorite game? im sure ive never played it =)
4Yep
I'm only on because I have a loud thunderstorm that's keeping me up
Haha.

confluttershy.jpg

We got a big storm the other week
4I thought your name looked familiar
We could use some rain here in Houston
LOL
Since then, no such luck.
make up ur mind =(
actually I'm in Dallas at the moment
Things going yellow in Houston?
My maternal fear is tornadoes.
MFW seeing those dudes
http://www.jlcauvin.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/400px-nerdy_guy.jpg
for fathers day
XDDD
ok im back
same glasses and suspenders
jk
I always get worried there could be a tornado with a storm this big.
I need a new backpack, would this be... overkill? http://www.kmart.com/shc/s/p_10151_10104_080W032040560001P?prdNo=15&blockNo=15&blockType=G15
no idea how that happened, but it finally logged out.
Twilight Sparkle...Duck Bright?
for a minute there I forgot I was at my parents house this weekend
4Duck Bright
dusk*
lol
oops...
Dude.
oh yeah the same day as my last day of public school I was joking around at recess
Be a MAN.
typos are evil
4No, you're fine.
i am a duck]
making people laugh and saying that all nerds wore glasses
quack
lol
when I myself wore glasses
4>implying DuskBright has been a duck all along
but yeah it is very drought like in houston atm
IRL troll
:P
and some girl far off was all offended and crying about it
Depends on your definition of overkill ;)
REAL MEN WATCH MLP:FIM AND ARE PROUD OF IT
"Oh hey that sounds like Krillin"
it's like scootaloo being a chicken
and her friends were like OKAY I GUESS UR A NERD THEN >(
and I was like DUH DUMBASS
Wow, some people these days can't take a joke
XD
4But she is a chicken
ture
and dusk is a duck
and now here we are 5 years later with the same dumbass girls buying fake dumbass frames
Maybe she was a Fluttershy.
And I actually don't mind a little rain, but T-storms can go...
*true
My mane probelm is that it isn't quite big enough and there aren't enough pockets
man i gotta typoe slower
and going NERDS R SO CYUTE BACKWURDS SMILEY FAYCE(:
>_>
4These are all true, haha
fake frames are retarded
Mod your own backpack?
looks at keyboard
just get a real backpack ans sew on some patches?
if you don't need glasses don't get them
and I'm like BITCH SHUT THE FUCK UP IF YOU WERE SO OFFENDED BY WEARING GLASSES BEFORE THEN WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S CUTE NOW???
haha I'd hate to see a tornado where I live. we'd lose it
Read my mind, Jean
I had the backwards smiley face first. ):
Er
DJ
s is not close enough to c
No, Jean
arg
we had a small earthquake here and government offices where shutdown.
I know dari
:P
My biggest fear is to get a Joplin tornade
yeah but it's close to d
*_*
What's that?
sideways smiley face!
the ending of L.A. Noire
Finally
/me reads your mind
DJ, you mean the one in Ottawa?
so now with all the girls wearing their stupid fake frames I gotta hope I don't look stupid with my REAL glasses that I ACTUALLY NEED
im uriginul
yep
hahaha
and the general slipping of the finger
transitioning
your mind is a silly place
My cousin lives right in the middle of where it happened
Mine certainly is
and dragging finger across the keyboard once in a while
hey i didnt make a typo there
That or you are drunk.
lol
lol
gotta go for real nao, my cousin left and im preparing for a show(gonna wear rainbow dash cutie mark shirt for good luck)
O.O
nah, not drunk
although that would be easier to say
my dog is giving me a death stare
im curious to ask their name, 6 degrees of seperation and all that xD
good luck\
Good luck lolwut!
*hic*
that's exactly what a drunk person would say
"SOON"
lol
lolwutman gl bro(ny)
later
XD
Heh, chances would be slim anyway
I think maybe I'll get a pony bag for gaming. Now the question is... Fluttershy and Twilight or Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash
Fluttershy and Twilight.
Pinkie and Dash
FT
LOL
but im a huge twilight fan.
Heh
DJMidli
yes
I love fluttershy but I also love dash
I'm disappoint
for the record
why?
your real glasses are awesome
Twilight is best pony
:P
You like the movie about sparkling vampires the best
:P thanks I guess
K
let me rephrase that
what is vamp?
oh I know why my dog was doing that
I'm getting Flutter/Twilight. More pockets!
Twilight is.... I love her, but she's a bit too normal for me to like her best.
Secret but fun
"Im a huge TWILIGHT SPARKLE, the purple pony from MLP FiM series..fan"
"Bitch, I'm trying t sleep, turn your music off!"
is that better Kiniest
that's what he was thinking
XD
lol
Sure.
purple is best color Donatello
yeah
Whattteeeeeeeeeeever you say.
I don't even associate the word Twilight with vampires anymore
does machines
Wait...
i was just listening to it
Rainbow Dash is cool but rude
So this show cured you of that?
It has references to Dungeons and Dragons (I'm only vaguely aware of what that is, some kind of board game?)?
If so: YAY
Pinkie Pie is a party dude
pinkie pie is a
not sure at all
ninja'd
i was questioning it too
it did. This show is the best thing to happen to vampires in a while
Haha.
God I hate the twilight series.
So, so much.
Pinkie Pie first came off as a normal overly excited cartoon character
Fluttershy /Rarity leads?
And my perspective changed.
there's also those teenage girls who say stuff like
Ah well, what did I expect from media? XD
Did anyone have an unfair idea of Rena Ryugu from Higurashi at one point?
Magic Friendship Little Ponies, Magic Friendship Little Ponies, Heroes on four hooves, Pony power
yeah, its unfortunate that bronies are easy to make fun of =(
"YOURE TOO YOUNG TO THINK THINGS WONT BE OKAY" even though they're FUCKING TEENAGERS NOT GRANDPARENTS and then the next thing they talk about how awful everything in their life is
Meh, who cares.
nope always thought they were ALL being manipulated
yeah
hypocrites
I thought Rena was a normal yandere.
but did not suspect alien virus
I care
me too
it's kinda hurtful
Ok, not really.
kinda though
grammar bad now that sleepy
I'm about to post the best song in the world.
FOX NEWS
i just people would actually be informed abotu it
I'm ready to be impressed
instead of the love-to-hate thing
Indeed
I'm more on the side of "and not a single fuck was given that day".

This...can't be serious

Nah. I'm just kidding. :P Never played D&D.
its basically where the tween music is going
I just unfriended someone who is guilty of a lot of the stuff we were talking about and it was annoying me
I don't think it's a parody.. I hoped to god it was at first
which means when these tweens grow up
Really like Baldurs Gate tho.
OH GOD

Yeeeahh I'm not indie enough to enjoy this.
It's oldschool EDM right? from like the 70's?
I'm so indie, what's Call of Duty?
[zZz]ekeS: GET YOUR ASS IN THERE BEFORE CASSY KILLS ME.

Is it bad that when I see muscular guys I instantly think "what a douche"? http://tosh.comedycentral.com/blog/files/2010/11/i-like-turtles.jpg
4So yeah, Turni reminded me of that PMV
uh oh one of my friends just sent out she apparently broke her nose tonight at that show :CCC
um that depends
D:
Saw one with FF1 characters.
that guy does look like a douche
but not all big dudes are dbags
maybe not always
but I did for him
no they aren't
I just think it for guys that look like that guy
yeahh
4Got a question, anybody like Duke Nukem?
ah cool
And I mentioned I wasn't indie enough to enjoy it ;)
Yes.
Why does he look like a douche? O_o
How goes the day? |D
Or...night
4Then I think you'll like this

I don't even know
but something about him does
4Trust me, just watch it
I can't place it
I prefer not to judge people till I talk to them.
I know a couple of Fluttershy guys who are massively tall and quite athletic.

Oh lord
I'm like you most of the time dari but you can't always help but judge people on appearance sometimes even if your opinion changes later on
yeah
deskslam. dangus interwebs
like I know at least 50% of people that see me are probably like
"what a blind hipster douche"
WELP. Its 2AM here. I best be off to sleep iffin I'mma gonna go to Church in the morning or something
The storm is ending!
Yay!
4See? Pretty awesome huh?
later folks
like a few weeks ago I was in mcdonalds and this grown man with his kids started laughing at me and he said IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU??? across the whole room and everyone turned
byebye
Argh. My internet makes me not know what's happening
I like original duke
and duke 3D
oh my
It's 3 am here, I should probably do the same in a few
I was pissed
I try not to judge people without knowing them, but with some people I just can't help it
12Good ^^
it's 3 am here. I am going to enjoy Luna's beautiful night
people question it all the time and I don't really care but you don't have to be a dick about it honestly
It's 2 AM, but I'm waiting for the storm to be gone.
^^^^
make sure luna feels loved.
Yay night!
I think with that picture I posted earlier he just has an air of cockiness about him
exactly
12Been drawing a lot of art
4It's Duke Nukem singing the Ducktales theme song!
DJ, did that YTP make you feel better?
I do love my sleep, but we had such a pretty moon recently...
Jon St. John?
It was something.
12Most of it has been fail art though XD
The summer sun celebration's in 2 days anywya
What's happening for that?
(Aka the summer solstice)
4That actually wasn't Jon St. John, but some guy who used to visit the fightingamphibians site
I meant pony-wise, if there were any events plannedor anything
O_o
If you say so.
03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
02There, Fixed.
02now z-z
Good, because he made a 2-3 minute video of Justin Bieber.
D;
:v
nuu
/me huggles Ray goodnight
Nighty Night Ray~
/me hugs back
Pretty good
I dunno. If I had more Brony/Pagan friends I'd plan a party.ritual
why do you hate me internet?
02Night~ ^^
why?
4People heard his voice and everyone unanimously thought that it was amazing he sounded just like Duke. So what did they do? Ask him to sing the theme song from Ducktales
...speaking of Bieber, has anyone done a Bieber PMV?
I'm afriad to look
afraid*
I think I might be in teamspeak with that person
Pony pagans. Now there's a thought.
Baby, baby, baby ooooh
I would've punched that guy in the face
I know like 1 or 2, but they live a bit aways from me
if he said that about me
Fightingamphibians.
yeah well
the whole love and tolerance thing goes really well with paganism
Well.
big black man vs me
I get it
oh
who do you think would win
4:P
lol
Also, I hope you told that guy that he was a sad old man who should go and wallow in his own pitiful existence before he gets too old and fat, and dies miserable and alone when no one loves him.
12Good night Ray :3
DJMidli, does a certain hate for JB need to be satisfied?
yeah, if it were a bigg guy I would've been too afraid to
:P
Is this Battletoads?
Theoretically it goes well with a lot of religions. It's in practice where things go awry.
If he hit you, he would be going to jail.
I almost felt like pulling the race card though but I knew it was wrong so I didn't @___@;
Room full of witnesses.
either way
he was a jerkface either way
another reason I like small towns
JB?
people are USUALLY nicer than that guy
until rumors come around
yeahh
rumors spread like... something that spreads
mostly people are nicer about it if they ask
one of my friends is kind of rude about it though
but I'm too nice to tell him to stop it
DAT SETUP... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCxqEv-Rcx0&feature=related
4Fightingamphibians is a pun for Battletoads, yes
4I've only been to the site once, though
Shoulda gone with CombatAmphibians tho.
the worst I ever get is occassionaly I hear people whispering "Is he SERIOUSLY wearing a Star Wars/Pokemon t-shirt?"
4Maybe, but I doubt they'd change it now
XD
DJMidli yes. the song needs to be done in a aggro dubstep tone with a voice clip of "STFU" mixed in
and know I know what the Katyanagi twins' act in Scott Pilgrim was based off of
that's so normal around here
but when I hear that I feel like this...
*now
http://bdadv.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/haters_gonna_hate_10.jpg
<---Dork
That's the thing I really miss in older stuff: BASS
XD
my sister hates my Pokemon obsession
:C
"Embarrasses her"\
oh that reminds me
aye
When they make the MLP shirts in men's sizes that'll be me. XD
are you gonna collect the pokemon toys from mcdonalds?
it's like pfft, what I like shouldn't reflect on you
Yes!
when does that start?
Also. You gaiz
did it already?
it's already started
4What
Sweet!
McDonald's tomorrow it is
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jus4GsEkSIQ
it began friday here, at least, it might be different for you
guess what!
so far I have pikachu and reshiram
what
I watched Pokemon this morning on TV?
4Of course, how did I not see this coming :/
:D
oh lol I did too
the new series?
the B&W season is actually pretty good from what I saw
It was bound to happen eventually.
yeah
I saw the Snivy episode :D
yeah I guess
4Bigolo
4Detective
4Bigolo
I've been pronouncing Snivy wrong :<
that cilan character needs to quit making those food puns though it was getting on my last damn nerve
With a w.
Yeah, he's annoying
I like how they use the in game music
ITZ A RE$IP33 4 FR!3ND$H!P!!!!!!!!!1111!1111!1111!!111
4This makes me pine for Escape From New York
I love the snivy episode
it would be so much better if it was Ash Brock and Misty....
yeah me too
ITS HOW I FEEL ABOUT PEOPLE IN HALF AN HOUR /foreveralone
Why so?
4I dunno really...I think because I wanna see Kurt Russel being the man that would later inspire the creation of Solid Snake
Celestia's crown fits on Spike the Dragon's head
royal coup
Woah
Haven't seen it?
wow
4I have actually
Any pokemon other than the originals with Brock, Misty, and Ash, meh.
4And I enjoyed it, even if I did lose track of where the film was going halfway after the movie was over...
none will ever be as good as the originals
at least when brock cooked and made food puns he was wearing a lacey doily apron
which made up for it
XD yeah
My quit message
:P
Urgh, so tired. I think it's time for me to quit.
goodnight
:P
Seen the sequal?
Night everypony
man it died in here
4No, I haven't. I probably should though
hi people I don't know
Hello there
hi Flashgen
you know now us
O.O
I don't know anyone named "now us" but if you say so
check out this shirt
I need it O.O
http://shirtoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/haters-gonna-hate-snivy.jpg
You could say it's basicly the same movie. But with alot more action, and one hell ofa ending.
hahha
that's awesome
4Does it star Kurt Russell?
Ofcourse.
:(
4Then it's worth seeing
It is.
;_;
4I'll admit, I do like some action films
4But overall, I just can't get into the ones released today
Nightmare_Moon: can you tinyurl the link?
You can't just doubleclick it [zZz]ekeS?
:P I have no problem with the recent ones.
;_;
Machete from last year might be the best action movie I've ever seen.
Who would even be mean to derpy?
I'm beginning to give up on trying
D'awwww
Nightmare_Moon: my phone's ssh client's url scanner doesnt like linebreaks :s
4Machete, I know what you're talking about
dangus internet
4Had that guy...
Silver spoon, diamond tiara, gilda, trixie
Ah, phone, ew. hold on
snips, snails
True
4I can't remember his name :(
Thunderstorms?
Machete wasn't bad... I didn't care for bits of it... but it was generally good
On MY dad's fathers day?
?
still, derpy is so damn loveable.
quentin tarantino (no idea how to spell his name lol)
:[
http://goo.gl/9aLoc
ew
manboob
;C
XD yeah
You Pegasus ponies better STOP this storm right now, you should be ashamed!
http://tinyurl.com/3npnmux here you go
Didn't have Tarantino. Tho he may have had a hand with producing or something. I dunno.
3
:s
4Speaking of Tarantino, I did wanna see Inglorious Bastards
6AMAZING MOVIE
:D
the yay song came on my iTunes
SOOO GOOD
for the record
actually we need some fathers day images ponified.
Everyone, Mongoose shot me yesterday
I barely made it.
I'll take your word for it.
this song sounds epicly amazing in sorround sound
She broke my heart
/me tears up
*surround
(on a side note I really should add that autotinyurl script, but I'm not sure I want every link that pops up in irc sent off)
4Why hello Sprinkles :3
...or however you spell that
4Lurking in the chat, are we?
You got it right the second time.
4And I guess you never saw it, Turni?
okay
Nope.
Tiny URL makes it impossible for me to see what site I'm going to :c
12bbl
I like knowing beforehand if I'm clicking on a link to an image, a youtube video, a fic, etc. before I click it.
Some just slip by. :P
4*nods*
I made a dragon cry.
Anyone have a favourite film?
4So what are you hear for this night, Turni? There's no stream, just here to chat?
4*here
Deal with it.
4Jacob's Ladder
4My most favorite film of all time
The Machinist or The Shining.
I should be in bed by now, It's morning somewhere in the. And I have a cosmos to thank tomorrow.
Also. Yes, just seeing if there was someone here.
Hmm, I don't have a favourite, I've seen too many to really decide, and there's not one that I say I really enjoy watching so much more than any other.
where's the fun in that Fooby
4The Shining, I can't take the movie seriously when Nicholson continuously makes hilarious faces throughout the film XD
Well I could. :P
4Give it time, dari, you'll find a movie that'll probably blow your socks off
xm28e4
Probably the only horror movie that has ever given me the chills.
Hmm, I don't really see that happening, I don't have a favourite of anything really.
And I saw Jacob's Ladder after you guys talked it up so much in a thread a while back. :P
who's still up?
Fluttershy...
make me a women
4What did you think, Turni?
i am
So, I'm off to bed now. Good Morning everypony, enjoy your waking hours.
Predicted the twist off-hand. :P
Night, moon.
4Twist aside, what did you think
Man, I am up late if Nightmare Moon goes to bed before I do
Eh... Dissapointing. Besides the solid opening.
the sun is currently rising somewhere over the middle of the atlantic.
You are still not as terrifying as the combination of Ribbons Almasy and Grace O'Conner.
Which had a great atmosphere. And I thought the rest would be like that.
But then, that combination is more terrifying than many things.
such as every single monster on Dr. Who.
But it wasn't. :P Then there was this whole "for the critics" religious symblism stuff. :p
Well thats nice, it put my password in chat instead of the window... Well, wont be using that one again. BTW, it is already changed
4Well, yeah, the movie is based heavily on religion and symbolism
4What did you think of the "scary, creepy" stuff? Or how about the hospital scene?
I don't think anyone here would plan on breakinginto your account anyway :s
The hospital scene was pretty good. But the rest wasn't exactly scary or creepy.
Someone said it inspired Silent Hill. So I also went into thinking there would be a lot of "otherworldiness" and stuff like that.
I agree, but.. best be sure :P
I don't blam eya'
blame*
sho'nuff
I had to re-register with a different, dedicated addy anyways :) (made it for the blog/login for the site)
4Nah, though that scene and the special effects of the creatures and atmosphere, as well as cinematography, did have a tremendous affect on Silent Hill as a series
And that silly fasthead stuff. :P
4If you want "otherworldiness," go watch the actual Silent Hill film
Oh
This is the best fandom I have ever seen, I am proud to be part of it
4Yeah, the whirring head effect was really prominent in the Silent Hill series.
6The Silent Hill movie was really good. IMO
4You can just get out Sprinkles >:I
I love you too
I shall stick with The Machinist. ;P
6Never seen it.
6Also, MAKE ME GHOSTIES
4Neither have I, actually
4You think I'm gonna kick you, don'tcha?
I suppose it is kind of like Jacob's Ladder in some ways.
6I think you CAN'T
6I'm ADMIN currently, remember?
4I BET THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO
Lol, you can't kick him.
He's an admin.
4...Oh yeah!?
^_^
Oh.
Just make out allready. ;P
This really is an awesome/weird fandom.
Didn't even see Sprinkles had posted.
XD
4You know, a few people the other night did say Sprinkles and I had a RD/AJ relationship thing
yes it is
6...did I miss this?
6What?
4You were there, Sprinks -_-
6I was not paying attention then. XD
4-______________________-
6O-o
As a woman, to me, there is nothing manlier for a man to be himself, even if he loves MLP, and express himself in that.
6I blame insomnia/hunger
I wouldn't be surprised if you guys were married.
open the door
Lawl.
For 25 years.
get on the floor
4We're not, he lives all the way up in PA while I live in NC
T.T <---Manly tears
Lies.
6Silver lives in PA.
They live together.
6And Hipster is in OH IIRC...
4Hipster is in Ohio, Silver and Sprinkles are in PA (albeit opposite sides of the state) and I live in NC
4North Carolina
6Where's DCD and Peanut?
6...and Bristle?
4DCD is in Paname?
4*Panama
http://i.imgur.com/0b1AI.jpg
The show itself has helped me evaluate my own friendships. And I try to be as joyful as possible... and I'm really starting to take this whole Love and Tolerate the shit out of you thing seriously
4I dunno where Peanut and Bristle
4is
I would only be worried if I found an inflatable pony in the shed with a wedding band on its hoof :P
6Yeah, it's Panama
4Speaking of which, did Bristle even make it to the streams this weekend?
what if it was Fluttershy?
Then I would steal her for myself!
;)
6I don't believe so.
He's not as dedicated as I am.
:P
4Yeah, dedicated that you were on our most wanted list for about two weeks
;D
But you see I'm really not a bad man.
Am I the Highlander?
I have the best of intentions.
Besides. I'm probably off that list by now. :P
4Yes, well, at least now we finally found a system that works
I think if you're off the list, there isn't a list any more. :P
6No, there's one pony I've been watching.
4Yeah, there's not exactly a "people us mods are finding annoyances with" list anymore
6Won't say who.
4It was all pretty much Turni : /
4Why Sprinkles?
6Because I don't want word spreading.
6I'll tell you later, maybe.
Someone had to champion some sort of "oposition" ;P
4Dude, you know you're not supposed to keep secrets from other mods : /
6Then mod chat.
Alright
So what's the deal
It really should be obvious that I'm watching this guy who's been nickchanging constantly.
I wish XChat supported ctrl-tab
He's a bit of a troll.
Sprinkleburg?
Normal nick he goes by is MFW
Yeah, he used that.
I thought it was him
He also used Brony_Hipster
It looked like he was annoying you earlier today
And one other nick.
Besides the constant nick changing, what's the big deal?
It's not like he's insulting anyone or trying to cause mischief
He trolls a bit with each nick before changing.
Can you give me an example how?
It's little things that slowly add up, mostly.
He also used BroDashRain
As a nick.
When we had a user called RainBroDash.
But he uses the nickchanging as a way to make it seem like it's not the same person for those who aren't paying attention.
So he keeps trying to divert attention away from him
Like I said, I just have my eye on him for the moment.
I remember a couple weeks ago we had a spambot called "Derpy" in the chat. >___>
But yeah.
And I never really had a problem with the mods. Just the lack of creativity some of the bronies had with their choices. :P
I remember that aswell.
Why someone would drop a spambot in our chat I have no idea. :
Sure, sure.
I dunno. If the guy continues to make a ruckus, then kick him. If he continues to cause mischief then ban him
4Dude, Turni
That was the idea.
4Come on
But I wanted to see something I hadn't seen before. :P
I think I actually warned him earlier...
4Not the mods' fault
Did he keep up?
Like I said. I never ever once blamed the mods.
I don't know why most mods seem to make a big deal out of kicking people.
goodnight
er, morning
I don't see why you shouldn't get a kick automatically for talking too much.
just watched the NPR radio
I warned him right before he left for the night.
4You mentioned something about "bribing the mods." Don't think that didn't go unnoticed
How was it?
That's the way IRC is mostly, and you can just rejoin straight away.
Watching radio
It wasn't as bad as I thought
I used to love NPR
It's not as though it's a BIG thing.
4You sounded awfully trollish a few times
it seems kind of like a cheap shot
That was a joke, lighten up.
I did not watch it.
what did they say?
NPR just wants to fit iiin
I'm hesitant because we get some ponies that don't know how IRC works and don't know how to rejoin.
except the part where they assumed that every brony is over 20 and unemployed
and yes, i obviously meant heard it.
They can always refresh the page.
That's true, IRC isn't exactly the most well known chat system
4You pissed Hipster off pretty badly
6Myself as well.
/me is drunk
Fluttershy D:
6It was, whether being a joke or not, a question of our integrity.
Besides, you could add into the rules how to rejoin channels after a kick, so then if they don't know, it's their own faults. (:
It was not.
True.
I never thought that Fluttershy would drink.
4We do try to maintain an attitude of professionalism and Hipster and maybe Sprinkles saw it as an attack
she has before
in that one fic
daterape
ohai
yep
I'm a fan of not treating stuff on the internet as SRS BIZNIZ.
eyo :3
So I didn't really care.
Yeah, we could tell them how to rejoin
now getting tosti's
mfw there are two fluttershys here
:o
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
....
One broke my heart.
4And that dari is why you're the chatroom :P
i like Grandma's Tosti's
meh just came in
You could even add it into the kick message I suppose.
Hahaha.
wtf why is the face cross eyes
:o
eyed*
:o
And why would I question your integrity when I don't really know you guys. Especially not then.
No... no... I just came back from one of Pinkie's parties.
I am daed
ahh you are still awake
We should probably at least tell people about it by visiting the rules. Then again, we do that every BMN
I am dated
...Pinkie tried a 21 and older type party.

Face it, you took it all alittle too seriously.

That's kinda annoying.

< o >
don't look at the Flutters
wadn't me
4And that's why I'm glad everybody is finally, for the most part, on the same page
¬¬
don't lock mod
Anyone sending as many messages as is required for a kick anyway is pretty hard.

Insanly
I dunno
I can't argue it's status this time. :P
that's how bored i am
It's pretty empty
This chat always seems to have lots of people
but no one talking
ever since the new chat
New chat?
4You can think Tacowiz for that one. I was there for the selection thread for the first BMN and Tacowiz was dying for it to be chosen
i mean, the new transition
idk how to describe it
Ohh.
The swap to IRC
Yeah
yeah
wonder what's going on
people are sleeping?
before there were like 20 people in a channel, but each one was talking
It's really short though.
Oh, wait.
I get it.
58 people here, and only 6 talking
50 minutes or so.
hmm
4Have you seen it already? Oh, a clip
The server's not identifying me properly. I better check my server info on my client.
And saw the running time. :P
I'm talking
mm... nah
Hello Dash.
/me declares the new topic shall be "Discuss Fluttershy's perfect match."
You could really play a extra pony ep in the end.
I think my perfect match is a tree.
I want to be a tree.
lolwtf
A tree is fun.
i mean pony
Tree is wood
What did the tree say to the bartender?
A tree is just as beautiful a forest creature as the little bunnies running around <3
I wood like a beer please.
/me wanders back in
Oh, all the little forest creatures.
Wasup BFB
Don't forget the little creatures indeed
4We'll figure out what to do later in the week. If anything, I'm actually happy it's so short. I'm usually exhausted by the time the BMN is over and if we can shorten the actual event then I'm all for it
Not much... just doing some end-of-day stuff before calling it a night.
Wait.
Why the hell is the server telling me...
Hm...
Lol fail.
o.o?
4Wut?
well if going in a dead chatroom is in your list of end-of-day stuff, go ahead and check it off the list.
4WELL I GUESS TURNIBRONY DECIDED TO LEAVE
We are deader than a cadaver.
4The jerk >:I
I-I'm dead?
I swear, I'm gonna get this fixed so I can auto identify.
more dead my good friend
:/
Think he crashed maybe.
...
From the quit message.
4Eh, oh well
There's no reason that password should be incorrect.
4You saw how he left?
[09:08] * TurniBrony (mibbit@36cd2766.246a3fd8.dhcp.bluecom.no) Quit (Read error: Operation timed out)
4Huh, neat
Okay.
There we go.
Mongoose always dresses in style.
Cool.
I have a voice.
You guys don't. :P
:P
lol I just watched the MLP:FiM episode Pinkie Keen
SirSprinkles, he's back
aww
Twilight Rapidash
You want a voice?
4I can speak just fine dari
and Princess Celestia dropping out of nowhere from the sky
oO;
RarityxApplejack/Rainbow DashxPinkie Pie/Twilight Sparkle x Trollestia/Me x Spike.
Sprinks, main room
How?
Is that acceptable?
I doubt he'll say much, not many people left. :P
Hm...
Haha.
Good point
Twilight Sparkle is evolving!
Okay, so that didn't work as I thought.
Just had to test real quick.
And now I'm in for a while.
for some reason
I'll ask again
The last bit where Spike was about to send the letter to Princess Celestia via magic
RarityxApplejack/Rainbow DashxPinkie Pie/Twilight Sparkle x Trollestia/Me x Spike.
y6es
I see RarityxRD working
IS IT ACCEPTABLE?
When she just drops from the sky. takes it, then flies off
oO
I dunno why though
Hey mib_5rubc6.
I've got auto identity going, and that's all that matters.
Oh that reminds me I have a friend and she is always complaining about there never being any RarityxRD fanfiction.
I like Poseidon Project and The Sun Is Tired right now.
Can't wait for more.
Well, can...
Y'know, figure of speech.
oo
I really wanna start a fanfic
but I just can't seem to find the inspiration for one
Kinda the same for me.
Fairly Odd Parents?
eh?
the reference or what?
Welp, just the three of us.
OH
Oh oh oh I can help
Actually no, I was just saying it for no reason.
>Rewatch old episodes
>notice animation error or odd background detail
>make a conspriacy out of it
4Just like old times
>instant fanfic.
BAM
Regular users are asleep POST WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT!
lol
lol fairly odd parents
Rainbows! :D
Hang on.
Let me grab a screenshot,
'cause this is is how a friend and I are going to co-author an AWESOME fic
It's a trap!
Oh whoops.
I always forget to turn these things off.
4True
hehehe
4I post in reds
Suddenly.
Princess Celestia
Also
Congratulations! Your TWILIGHT SPARKLE evolved into RAPIDASH!
my butt hurts from these stupid chairs at my Granma's PC X.x
4Oh, now you're just showing off
:P
and take note, HP Keyboards suck, badly
Change them
Use a Logitech
Or an IBM Model M
Do you remember this scene from A Bird In The Hoof?
http://i134.photobucket.com/albums/q120/leaf_on_wind/whatarethosedoingthere.png
i use a ZBoard, a gaming model, the best out there
Lawl.
yeah I remember that
I tried a random kick.
but my grandma is stubborn and gets these crappy ones :/
I'm the only person I can kick.
FiM = Avatar perfection with more <3 ^_^
Except I've tried it 4 times and it's only tried to kick you Ghosties. O_o
Why does Fluttershy have the Gala dresses D:?
Oh, I can't even kick myself.
I think it suits her
Random kick, but it 12 tries for it to try and kick me with only 3 of us on here.
Lol.
4Dari, I would kick you but you're the hobo of our chatroom that we feel sorry for. That, and you ARE the chatroom, I can't kick you!
Eek!
hmm...
Take a note.
XD MFW
Hehe, timing
I am terminated?
You left ages ago.
why wouldn't she?
An idea is forming...
XD MFW?
Doesn't Rarity show up in her GGG dress at the tea party?
but I don't think I can make a story with it
4And Turni returns
I never left
it doesn't show rarity's dress i think
THEN WHO WAS FONE?!
[09:08] * TurniBrony (mibbit@36cd2766.246a3fd8.dhcp.bluecom.no) Quit (Read error: Operation timed out)
It was only 17 minutes ago, apparently I'm just going crazy.
i think Fluttershy has them for safe keeping o3o
You're doing it wrong.
My Face When
Guess it kicked me out for inactivity or something.
I started that -- rationalizing.
If you want a fic idea,
MAKE A CONSPIRACY OUT OF IT
And so I did.
idk
FLUTTERSHY THE MASTER THIEF
I want to write a Battlestar Galactica/MLP crossover.. RainbowDash would be a perfect Starbuck
right.....
Also you can't take it 'cause it's mine :c
Your connection just lagged too much so the server kicked you I suppose.
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/108/766/MLP_Books_4.jpg?1301091345
Yeah...
Well I can do something about Fluttershy's hidden past.
I have her dresses.
I guess.
Though normally when that happens you'll get "Ping timeout 120 seconds".
She keeps bothering with me.
W-what hidden past?!
i have a book here
/me looks around suspiciously
it's awesome, no, epic
The best fic is a good fic.
True stroy
Don't worry, I have no idea as of now.
it was expensice, aroun 67 Euro's
You'll think of something.
Why so much?
Maybe it was custom styled to fit my personal needs.
History, Legacy & Legend, Duke Nukem Forever, Art From The Vaults
I strongly recommend this to all writers.. http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter.html
because the special edition was expensive
/me runs
What does it do? .-.
So.
I dunno, maybe they changed the default timeout message for this network, though I've never seen any other networks which give message other than that for a ping timeout.
Apparently
Its a novel writing program, basically, information storage.. best to have a look, its the best I have seen.
you can make chapters with it
Storyboard, character bios... the lot
and yes
DNF
Duke Nukem Forever
Then I convert to ebook formats (epub usually) using Calibre 2
yes
The game that took 14 years to develop
great game, ot the best, but still epic
I take fics from here on my ebook reader :)
yes, it came out not too long ago
already beated it :P
I prefer to write things as I feel it
then break it up and edit it
I heard a lot of people were disappointed with it.
those don't know what a real game is
those where alot of CoD fanatics
Its good for that
only because Gearbox helpt Develop DNF
I ended up swapping chapters and things with stories I have written
Sweeping generalisation FTW.
They were like
Gearbox also made Modern Warfare 2
Duke, I am disappoint
Scenes, you can check who is in what chapter and things.
1.9 meg
the game was epic
not the best game, but worthy of a place in history
So. What's up?
Nothing much for me.
tommorow is the first day of school for me since i fell sick, i want to know what everyone thinks of DNF
i want to laugh, i'm gonna quote them too xD

>Can't buy Duke Nukem Forever because my stationary is busted. ;_;
What a world.
"It will not write your novel for you" I lol'd
4I have the demo for DNF, but I never finished it
Hehe
Maybe I should try the demo.
Cause playing FPSes on a laptop is hella rad.
4Haha, I'd only play Doom II :D
4My laptop isn't meant for gaming
Well I do have a pair of unfinished stories somewhere in my notebooks
Neither is mine. Don't have a mouse either. :P
bbl in a bit
4I thankfully do have an external mouse so I can play Morrowind on
k'
4There's just no possible way to play a FPS without a mouse, I don't see how it's humanly possible :S
Ditto
One I start writing.. I cant stop
It's starting that's hard.
That and finding another scene to switch to
Oh, cool.
Mono.
you know you have the main idea down
It is. But it's so awkward that it pretty much ruins it.
One I start
OoOOooOoOOoh.
Thats why I like ywriter. I keep a bio on all the characters, when I think of a storyline, I browse, extrapolate and see what I can do from there
I'll give it a try.
:D Fluttershy at a desk writing, getting excited, so adorrrable!
ditto
"yay"
I'm using a personal wiki to keep track of that shit right now.
lol
But having everything in one place would be cool.
Mmm, thats a good idea
I sure did have fun trying to play Fallout New Vegas on the laptop.
I watched Sonic Rainboom last nite, :D Fluttershy cheering, I almost fell off my chair laughing
:o Story idea.
WW
Couldn't bother with it. :P Shame, since it's a terrific game.

@DJMidli :Canada...is it cold there, like right now?
I've been thinking of picking up and moving there...for many reasons....one being I despise summer...
G3 IZ BES.. BAD
Norway
/me ish an aussie girl ^^
ALL OF U LOVE G3
Ahh the hunt begins:)
Lawl John Cleese. Classic.
ALL OF U
Where it almost seems at times like I'm the only brony. :P
Long Island is famous for humid, never ending summers...at least now a days.
I need a clever name for Pinkie
PaintSplash most of our cities still have summer. unless you go further up north.
in what contex?
context*
something like my previous names
You're only an hour ahead of me Turni.
PaintSplash 85% of us live within 300km of the US border. you have to be one of the 15% that doesn't for lack of summer
Have you not slept yet?
A pet name, or nickname? Affectionate, general?
Plentity, MiddaySparkle, RainbowSmash, FlutterAwesome
now granted our "Summer" is still shorter and not as hot as lets say..neveda
yes
Well...I was hoping for a cooler summer...
It's all June Gloom here in LA
than where I currently reside...
uhhhhhhh
got up at 11:00 haven't rested once
bye
Well. I woke up at 22:00 or something.
cya all
naptown, nuff said
gnite/day
thats one right
no wait
Well, yWriter seems like a useful tool... But it's ugly as hell.
Ten
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH IDEA
*plays Rarity's IDEA soundboard*
:P
so whats it like in norway
PaintSplash and no right now where i live in ottawa on average gets up to a high of 75-85 and feels like 90-100 with humidity.
I guess I sund kinda dim, I certainly didn't mean that Canada doesn't have summers...just shorter or generally cooler ones I assumed...depending on where you were.
well, was it taken alrady
the humidity is ottawa specific however as we live in a valley
Same as in any other places. Only it's in the future
damn mind blown
Its productive though :P
including I apparently live in an igloo year round :P
4Well, I'm going to bed. It's been fun everybody, I'll see you all later
cool (pun intended)
o/
Night Ghosties.
love you ghostie
which Id have to move like 700KM further north to do.
How do you guys do that?
4No homo
maybe
4No
Do what?
The name thing.
okay
4<3
The...Name thing?
what does that mean
Hehe http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic
Name shows up in a diffrent colour and links to their posts on the chat.
no the cat face thing
4Aw, I hope I didn't make sklar feel bad

TVT is the evil Wikipedia
PaintSplash no you didn't your's was an honest mistake. :P
since thiers like no one here can i use colors just this once
Instead of suckering you in with curious information
I have to turn the script off.
I'd live somewhere with short days
but the cold always gets to me
How do I shot colours?
Bitches still can't handle my rainbow text.
3but now skylar has the colors all your base belong to meeeeeeeeeeeee
3go to colors pick sjhdkjsadhfasdjksdh ohhhohohoho fffffffuuuuuuuuuuckkkkkkkkkkk
I would think
There's an option underneath the text box in mibbit I think.
Black text for the lulz
hey as long as there's a way to get food easily and there's electricity and the internet
I'd be alright
Or not
It just gets hot as all hell here...and everyone loves it....except me.
4it just turns it back to white
Default background is white.
So black text = white text on a black background.
So I get to listen to everyone love summer..and bitch about our brief winter...
4because white is suporiero

3Much like in African tribes. They send potential mods out in the jungle to kill a animal.
6You know you got mod because you can script. XD
Hah I know what you mean BFB
When I was at the camp
we had to walk through the snow to get to the cabin
I live in a complex, so aside from my car, the complexe shovels the walk...of course if I lived in a house, I'd get a snow blower.
and we all had our stuff too
7sirsprinkles did you like my movie selection

7so where do you live
6PA

SweetieBelle Our dog tried treating it as swimming.
also I love the snow.
You want snow? Come to Montana in January
My dog would continually dive into the snow face first...always had a little snow pile on her snout.
ST_Falcon or i could be where I am, in canada. which is yaknow further north :P
7nn
7n
7n
7n
7n
7n
All the fucking snow you could ever want. You'll never want to see snow ever again
7n
7n
7n
7n
7n
7n
Hehe, my dog kept trying to jump on top of it, leap out, fall back in.. Yet when she is in water, she tries to dig holes in it. Stands there, uses one front paw, pushes water aside, then the other front paw..
7n
7n
7well that solved nothing
Im canadian ST_Falcon,
7hmm
"to much snow" is not a term I can compute
because theres no such thing :D
I also lived in the german alps where it would snow 40-60cm a day in some cases.
Well, you have it tempered by the fact that you live in Canada.
7talking to myyself in a sing song voice even as i write this here
Which has things besides methamphetamine and despair.
7why didn't you hear my callllllll
7oh whyyyy yiyiiy
Despair?
@DJMidli I share your opinion.
we have pot and lack of jobs.
In Canada?
7I thuoght you hold me dearly
No, MONTANA has despair and meth.
@DJMidli and you are now 20% cooler to me.
And drunk driving.
7but in the end i guess you didn't feel that way
7but thats okay
and no speed limits?
I snowboard too which also helps with my love of snow
PaintSplash why?
Pick two and ha ha YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE
Also I hope you like tornadoes
7because i will rise like a phionex from the ashes
It's good to be in Cali
"to much snow" is a term you can't compute.
Pfff
In mah land we fight polar bears with bare hands and eat raw seal meat to survive.
Basically, don't come here.
all we got is trampy stars and more illegals at the Home Depot than in the back of the squad cars
7and then i will rise once againnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
7but i won't hold a gruge
funnily enough i was born in california
12Hi

That was a bit random.
O_o
I wish I could go to one of those IRL meet ups...but I'm always busy.
Uhh.
that NY one already passed right?
I don't know what to say. :/
Huh... apparently I haven't thought of a name of AJ
I remember making her one before...
7say anything to me and my heart will to thee no homo
Or Applejack's arch nemesis. Lucky Charm.
7warm
*snerk*
Eh, its to much of a hassel for me to venture in to manehattan anyway...I hate being there.
hm. Applejack....
what did I name you....
7so now this is getting awkward
7but i don't care
Applecrack, addicted to apples :P
PaintSplash you really owe it to yourself to go to a meetup
so much fun meeting other fans.
;o
boo
Why Sweetie, do you have a mind probe somewhere?
cow
COW
COWSSSS
that's exactly what I nicknamed AJ
I WANT BEEF
7come on let your heart open to me
@DJMidli I'll have to make some time I guess, its been a while since I had some real fun.
even if it is somewhere like NYC
12Floofy beef :3
:o
DRAKE
beef
People with their strange ways of talking at school has made me think of beef differently.
7come on i bronie love you and you must to
7or will you let me cry
Now I'm just thinking of it in the "Allow the beef, man" sort of way.
7like fluttershy
Argh.
now i'm hungry.....
7or will you make it up to me and make me laugh like pinkie pie
Hehe, Great minds think alike :)
Since that's what your sincerely want me to do
@DJMidli what did you do at the meetup? Aside from pose for photos.
Though don't expect me to sing along with you
12My favorite beef is jerky
my favourite is beefy and meaty beef

SNEAS.
Hey Internet, I've got a question
12Wb
06~~
Yessir?
haha
ohai Espeon
I've got this random mp3 sitting on my desktop labelled 'Happiness'
PaintSplash chatted about favourite ponies and etc.
!chatstats
Chat stats updating.
7you have made imossibaley happy
PaintSplash and just generally talked about general things
!stats
Stats updating at http://www.ho-ohrealm.net/chat/chatstats...
I KNOW I got it from this site, and it's a remix of Giggle at the Ghosties
Any idea where it came from?
I guess that was pretty straight forward huh?
Isukra:
12Good night everyone :3
how does it sound.
Gnite GL :3
basey, technoey, housey?
BANBANBANBANBABANBAN
drummy?
I'm sort of half asleep, I should have assumed.
Pretty basey
12lol
most people here are going to be nerds, they're spending a significant amount of their time on the internet on a poo
*pokemon chat
12what
On a poo?
Impressive typo.
^
enter is too close to backspace
it keeps the lyrics intact or are they chopped up kinda?
Sounds like alot of fun though.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Uv6XLHJYL8
Mostly intact, but it loops parts of it a lot
I'm here.
hmm.
7leaving me cold and unhappy
Also WB Turni.
why can't you find one yourself? I'm terrible for names
My internet herped and derped.
tbh if you have MU, upload the track, and ill be able to ID it in 10seconds flat.
we noticed...
7godammit norway guy you have made me cry
cause I'm CONSTANTLY keeping up to date on the remixes xD
Maybe it would be easier if I just uploa- Yep.
(comes with the territory of being a DJ)
7it was simply suppose to the prince and I
O_o
How many times have you been asked to drop one of these remixes on an unsuspecting club?
Suddenly.
How do I change my name back?
None yet. I don't spin at clubs
I HAVE been asked to spin at a MLP themed rave however.
Tonnes or loads?
7come on I've said weirder things in this song
They have MLP themed RAVES?
a promoter in ottawa is getting one together.
but no not normally.
given the sucesss of the fandom she's trying to find a venue etc etc and get something pulled off.
Maybe I just got cloned like in the 6th Day.
7for are bronie love is strong
I'm all the way at the bottom of Australia
Fewer people = fewer bronies, probably
Here's the song, by the way
http://www.mediafire.com/file/8k1797rtm46cwi3/Happiness.mp3
7and this day has been long
/me killed the chat
YEA!~
12i'm worse
no, i'm the worst
Mysterious as the dark side of the moooooooooooooooooooon.
:D Tassie or Melbourne?
they asked me to name a elder, i named him DustBone
X.x
7but is wrong to say i love you to my bronie
Melbourne, you?
7and Norway do you want to sing in my song
12that's a great name :D
Melbourne
Welp, I'm gonna hit the hay...
that was not an intentional pny realted remark...
gnite paint
i foun it too Sarcastic
xD
Nini :)
7come on say yes
What's the song about?
G'night
Its was nice talking to everpony.
Night
7anything
nice talking to you too
Night!
7you want
7 but you got to sing song it all night long
Allright. Atleast alittle.
:D !! Paydirt! I just found a seller on ebay who is willing to sell me all of their ponies in a bulk lot, their daughter is cleaning out her room. :D
;o
7awsome
Once I was on a date
But my choices sealed my fate
also why the hell am i downloading this song so slow.
The movie of the day was Death Wish 2
Oh torrents..ohu
What I'd love is an MLP sew-on patch
Because brutalising leather is awesome
Now that rape scene was awkward I'll tell you
12lol
12i don't do sarcasm online
12it is too broken
7keep going
7or not
Now she won't ever see me again
too bad, you seem good at it
Won't even call me a friend
12shhh godmodder D:
Seedybest "JackleApp - Giggle at the Ghostly (Ponyhouse Mix)"
She just said "stop stop stop!"
why? my RP character is awesome :3
my copy is from the biweekly music colection waka updates.
So I took out my axe. Chop chop chop.
Brilliant! Thank you!
yours is a meanie D:
12no
Yeah, I've been in there looking for boots
Or something.
12your RP character is really unfair and has no weaknesses, virtually impossible to beat
Am I the only one who doesn't understand RPing?
7ohhh thats mean but a little funny
12that is a bad character
12hi prince :)
as Temporal, Yes, unbeatable
12exactly so bad
yeah i can't believe its sitting at 1.4gb now
And no way would I ever watch Death Wish 2 with someone else. :P
when i'm not....erm, it couldn't be worse then ^^;
7no thats a movie for lonsome time
Was awkward enough to watch alone. :<
SweetieBelle, probably wouldn't be too hard to make one, eh? Just layer up some fabrics, bit of glue and BAM. Done.
06lolgodmodding
Why's it awkward?
7should have been postpone
Or get soft leather, have it embroidered
7and made into a super dome
12!espeon
/me now belongs to Isukra for 8 minutes
Good point
12Espeon can godmod me all he wants
7where i could rome
Then you have the freedom to download a graphic to the machine
12he's worth it :3
What would you pick for the image, though?
Hi, Bronies!
I tried RPing once, I just felt stupid. O_o
7and make some fome
<censored>, I <censored> hate friends who think you're nothing but...another person.
Please do not swear. You have sworn 1 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
actually, my RP char has weaknesses, evan as Temporal :3
Hey Jen.
7but who has the phone
Why is Death Wish 2 awkward?
7and will they pick up
Nothing but another person?
12you need more than 1 weakness to make a decent char
you want to know them?
You are nothing but another person. O_o
12unless it's a very obvious and large weakness
Sevral minute long rape scene.
Friends are special people.
Ah.
7becuase i'm crying in a cup
Friends are just people I like who like me.
They're still just people.
Bedroom scences in general are pretty awkward.
They're not just strangers who are there to be laughed at and killed.
erm...it includes floof, hugs, tickling, and freinds
7just trying to tell you to shut up
They're people. But not JUST another person.
Strangers are still just people. O__o
most stupid weaknesses ever :/
7and i'll strut up
7gett on in the ruff
Bedroom scenes I have no real problem with. :P
7just in you and me in the buff
Friends aren't just some random person. They're someone you know and that you should be able to trust, not end up in tears over some <censored>.
Please do not swear. You have sworn 2 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
7making it tough
:D I saw someone wearing a 20% cooler shirt yesterday too :P
Maybe the MLP FiM logo
06I would say you're swearing for the sake of it, but I'll just pretend it doesn't happen :P
7but we like it rough
argh crap, I'm going to get off before I cause any more trouble, sorry
12those aren't really weaknesses at all
I don't need to cause drama
Maaaaaybe
Can I ask an administrator if there is any way I can make an account on the chat?
06Just take care, alright?
You can register a nickname.
12hope you feel better :/
That way no one else can steal it.
7and it'll make you tough
And how may I do that? (Thanks for your help!)
First type /nick the_you_want_here
Oh cool!
https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEZtWExHMmNNWXBDWTMzR1JUbGxrN1E6MQ
7like i said you and me in the buff
and Isukra, more weaknesses: Shaving off floof, and i think you remember that one.... D:<
7but now that time is over
12not really a weakness
7i guess was just a pushover
12you grew the hair back in like an hour
...
2 days ;.;
:D
12and it didn't cause you any real distress
7and like a rover
06wouldn't you end up rather super-poofy after say, 10 days then? o.O
I think that nick might already be registered Jen, because it changed your name to Guest8042847 automatically.
12that harmed your abilities to fight or injure you
So you need to choose a different one.
-le sigh-
OoOoh pretty...
Thanks for your help, though.
7you left me their
12we are having 2 different definitions of weaknesses going on here XD
I know just what I want.
well, there is one
7with a blank stair
7ohhohoohoho
7whoohooho
Waaant

Ok.
7just leave me to die
12my definition of a weakness is something that is really effective against you, giving you a large disadvantage in a fight if such thing is used against you.
if i remember correctly, Distortion of a time space continium over the Temporal orb at Temporal hill, and using that absorbed power against me, should kill me
12whats yours? XD
i just said it
7stabed me in the eye
DX
7but make it'll make you fry in the end
I think on this network it sends you a confirmation email.
With a code to complete the registration.
so just read the nightly wrapup
12you're not a dialga
the story about the guy whos mother threw out his ponies
12you're an umbreon :P
his rarity* cause "it was garbage" wow.
heartbreaking
I jawdropped when I heard about it.
i killed a Dialga
7but still i cry
i was the last Temporal Descendant in line
so, :3
http://applejack.sourceforge.net/ <---
Applejack
06I don't really have any established "character" or anything anyway soo :P
06No
7and i die a little inside
06It has applejack
06Just npo
Helping people solve their Mac problems
06no
12lol
Ohhi
!espeon
!isukra
Maybe the mother was jealous of Rarity
06I should add pony, all the pony names and others to the part of my script that limits what people can make me say
06because HAH
7as i contemplate sucide
/me flops
7but nooooo!
7 i am strong
:DDD
Espeon
What are you doing?
7i will rise once again like a phoenix from the ashes
06Not much at all.
Lightlugia and G-1 are :P
from what I hear you're still pretty bad for being too powerful, but there's always far worse
12the way i see it
lol Could be.
but G-1 is a prick, he's always bragging
12we all have strengths and weaknesses irl
^
7it will make us strong
12if you make a character with no weaknesses whatsoever
lol
12you aren't being very realistic
tbh i have a feeling it was more of the sterotyping bs.
Weakness: Death
Lawl.
" Quotes like the one at the start of the Wired interview that everyone keeps blasting us with are exactly what they are looking for. " hmmmh?
12we all have explicit weaknesses as well irl
Mother either thought her son was gay, or into girly things and knee jerk reacted in an attempt to force-mold her son into what she wanted
Alrighty, What song ARE you singing?
06About to say Weakness: Bullets or something like that @dari xD
i have a weakness irl
12something we keep to only ourselves because it could cause great harm if that info got into the wrong hands
All I have been hearing is pain and gibberish ^^:
We do
7because i've been making up a song since 5:48 or somethong
?
Pjony he's talking about the "Self-medicates by watching ponies"
Holy crazysicles, Valve has brony employees? I respect them 20% more now.
almost everyone has a weakness from their past; a realistic character has a decent history, so they'll have some vulnerability in that way
Pretty common sadly, especially in these times and as teens find themselves, become their own person..
7so i got else to put on
7 but i will go on
agreed
Okey Dokey Lokey!
but that's not something that would be an explicit weakness, in my eyes
And when the sun shines
7keep us strong
I like the Gorden Freemane avatar.
I don't have some specific weakness IRL.
The light hits my eyes
most common one around here, I THINK, should be being teased with being so damn awesome, referring to the interests here
Painfully.
7and you got sing along to your song
But you know this whole thing is wrong.
*most common interests
You and me, and me and you.
The whole world needs your additude.
06But completely randomly but still related
12if your character is made specifically for battling though
06the ones that I get annoyed at the most
12there needs to be some sort of big weakness
So stand up and fight, get back your rights.
06are the ones who for some reason has to try to "win" any roleplay
06xD
a character made specifically for battling should be balanced, yes
12why do you think in pokemon
7take flight
ditto
12there isn't a pokemon that has like 500 of each stat
12and has no weakness
Get rid of the cold and heartless nights.
agreed
^
12because it'd be too powerful and everyone would use it
(Wow, never thought I'd get this far)
06usually there's some glass cannon shenanigans going on if they have high stats for sure
also Pjony it doesn't help that it states hes unemployed.
06in attack, at least
Woaaaahhh
06you get what I mean
06you can't have your cake and eat it too, etc
Wooo-ooo-aahh-ohhhh.
which is where fox decided to stretch the truth like crazy and say we are all seeking welfare because where "addicted to pony"
my characters bio isn't anything of pokemon at all, it's a giand and brilliant mixture of differrent games, sometimes referring to other games, beings
7whhhhhhhhhhhooooooooooahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Go with the flow.
12i know
12i'm just giving an example
But the saying always told me you CAN have you cake and eat it? D:
Unlock the code.
and of course, powerfull things, maybe even religions
06I never understood it anyway
06I mean if you have a cake
7just enter the mode
06why not eat it?
Think about the world drowning but you're afloat.
^
12XD
Small minded people have to apply derogatory stereotypes and insults to make what they dont understand fit into their pathetic little worlds.
tbh I'm not worried because so far all of the hate has been from non reliable news sources or ones with absolutely no journalstic integrity.
12well what if you bought the cake for someone else?
06well then it's not your cake
06kinda
Well lots of saying don't make sense when you take them out of the context of how they were originally formed.
12for like their birthday party or something
12well it's your cake until you give it to them
06Yes
7so go to the goat
...
In fact most tend not to make sense until you actually look at their origins.
cake and RP's
12"Then" it's their cake
main cassarole of the day
Empty the moat?
/me nods
riiight, cause being unemployed is compareable across the pond to eating babies
Stand around, watch 'em gloat.
Nope, dingoes eat them.
Get on the boat, and take of to-
ANYWHERE
correct.
I SAY ANYWHERE~
I ride around in a kangaroo pouch so the dropbears dont eat me.
Mmmmmm
if you're unemployed in USA your worthless pathetic etc etc etc.
Mmmhmmmmmmm~
how better it is worked on, hom much more fun it is to use the Character
*how
I was talking about sayings, but I agree with whatever you're talking about too. XD
7but stop right there
and god forbid you apply for welfare you scum sucking lazy government abuser.
Living in a trailer park spending every cent you get on drugs and living on food stamps
yep.
7cause i'm no normal mare
as the stereotype goes.
i know right xD
12XD
(It's all you, I'm clueless)
"You can't have your cake and eat it too -- One can't use something up and still have it to enjoy. This proverb was recorded in the book of proverbs by John Heywood in 1546, and is first attested in the United States in the 1742 'Colonial Records of Georgia' in 'Original Papers, 1735-1752.' The adage is found in varying forms: You can't eat your cake and have it too. You can't have everything and eat it too; Eat your cake and have the crumbs in bed with you, etc. ..."
7cuase i've got the stare
/me packs her stuff and moves to Equestria
7that will put you in despair
Eat your cake and have the crumbs in bed with you?
Interesting.
Just come live in canada.
Take a punt, how many bronies do you think there are in Melbourne?
I know one other.
/me lost track .-.
Ok I get that kinda about the self-medication thing
because the crumbs are just as good as the original cake was
But, there has to be more..
12o-o
Notice how no canadian news has bashed MLP yet
SweetieBelle 100-200 at least
but the first quote-quote is imo pretty damn great
I haven't seen any Australian news do that either
And when FiM show here...
I know all op shops have been cleared out of ponies >.<
7if you don't work as a pair
06Oh
Austrialia and Canada are practically brother/sister when it comes to how we act.
06have the cake as in already eat it?
06well I guess that makes more sense o.O
12you can have your Espeon
12and eat it too
So I have heard
12well
12maybe just because you have your cake
06o3o
7(got anything or i'm going to say something stupid)
12doesn't mean that the right chance hasn't happened yet
12you can't eat cake and drive a car for example at the sametime
When I was travelling some Canadian tourists said that AU was just like being at home, minus the snow
12you have to wait to get to the house or where ever you are stopping
7you will never escape this flare
yep. all my friends who have vacay'd came back saying the same thing.
12you can't eat your cake in a no eating cake zone
12however i have never heard of such a zone XD
7and i got no(dammit)
i won'tr obey the rules in a no-cake zone
7i got nothin lets start with something new
12lol
i'll just eat mine :3
03777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777
12then they steal your cake
the cake is MINE, not theirs, so :3
i will eat it before it is stolen
12well they take the cake away from you and make you throw up whatever you ate
STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM!
Nobody breaks the law on my watch!
12XD
/me coughs
I'm confiscating your stolen goods, now pay the fine, or serve your sentence.
/me eats his cake in one big bite
what? i've got nothing
/me implodes.
I'd love to see some kind of military-style patch for the show
7well had good run so its over of course until i do it again
That's funny, because next week we are watching Se7en.
7so what now
7hello
0Hellllllloooooooooo
if only they actually did that.
12^-^
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrFmCXHFvUw&NR=1
There are probably more bronys in the furry community in AU
03k
/me ows and climbs out
12fine
why did you do that?!
11so its come down to this an Mexican stand-off
12the saying only makes sense to those who obey the law
11nobody wants to pull the trigger
Don't be an hero.
11but i've got to
11its been to damn long
...
11and were all gonna pay in the end one way or another
What the hell is this...? >__>
11its just about when
K well
11becuase none of is innocent
its 6:40am and i probably should get some sleep. night all
nini
G'night
03What I feel like atm
11and me well you all know what i've done
11so its gotta end sometime might as well be now
11so you bastards ready for one last stand-off
11well are you
11(BANG)
:( C'mon with series 2.. I am running out of s1 eps..
11the fight lasted many a hour but hey eventually saw there differences and became good friends except norway guy FUCK HIM
What do you mean running out?
The law is nothing. It's just words to restrict what we do.
11wtf are guys doing
I havent seen them all.
Up to 17
I feel like I've just broken every bone in my body.
Are you taking your time so they last longer?
Yep
Ill probably be through them tomorrow though :-/
or keeping us from doing stupid things
Slow down, otherwise you'll be left with fanfics, pmvs and art to last you until the next season
Ive been reading fics anyway
Ill be writing them myself soon as well
wouldn't that spoil later episodes?
Not offshoots
11thats right norway run you damn corward!
alright
I have a couple of weeks off starting next week
06Considering how many of us humans think and act, it's pretty much needed :P
I can always watch it all again :)
Oh my.
I have been on this whole time.
Silly me.
Leaving random windows open.
I also just noticed your name sidebar turns red when you are typing.
I was on Equestria Daily P:
lolwat
11NORWAY guy is the guy who left
No law = Somalia
Ah.
11he lives in norway so i call him norway guy
No Law = pretty much the end of social life, and maybe the world
like, you CAN go around killing people, and get away with it
doesn't make sense :/
That's the point.
Freedom.
too much freedom can be a problm
some people will abuse it
and with no law, say that 75% of the world WILL abuse it
maybe more :/
11hello
People will have to learn to be independent and not rely on others.
and then? what will happe if everyone will go around killing everyone?
it would be total chaos
That is the point, lol.
the law is needed to keep humanity in control, to but it bluntly, that is
If freedom is outlawed, then only outlaws have freedom.
that isn't really what everyone wants at the moment
Wish I could sing like SweetieBelle's voice actor
if that happens, like i said, chaos
06I get what you mean, but I can't say I agree. In an optimal world laws wouldn't be needed, but this world is quiiiiite far from optimal :P
^
No offense, but it takes you an awful long time to type, doesn't it?
11yes
Technically yes, because everyone has different opinions.
11but i can type helluva lot
everyone his/her opinion
that makes us human
or something :/
06Humans are super-protective about their opinions, add violent behavior and a lack of laws and there might be freedom - but I wouldn't say it's a good kind of freedom.
11i mean I've done what usually takes at least takes like a hundred people
that is the whole point
wheps
got to go
off to Home
12lol
cycling from grandma to home, takes aprox. a hour
There has to be a balance.
11okay maybe extragtion but still
BBL by then :3
12a funny way to think of it though
12is that if there werre no laws
I just watched the entire Fox News brony thing
12how many criminals would there be?
I think my head is now flat from all the facepalming, headdesking, etc.
06see ya LU
06It's fox news
06and it's the media
06they like scandals
faux news
ew
12show me the car fax
06And yes, there has to be a balance
I thought that Anonymous stuff and ObamaBashing was bad enough
This
/me now belongs to Isukra for 15 minutes
06and until we learn to keep that on our own without laws holding our hand (read: never), then removing them would lead to quite a bit of oddness.
Makes me want to jump train platforms
06I'm not sure if they have but if not, I'd love to see Fox News do a report on furries.
/me dies
12don't die
06It would be so facepalm-worthy I bet
oh god no
[21:00:27] <%Isukra> a funny way to think of it though
[21:00:31] <%Isukra> is that if there werre no laws
[21:00:37] <%Isukra> how many criminals would there be?
That is the point though
06hell they would probably screw up a report on trains or something
06and inb4 "no laws, no criminals"
the law defines what crime is
lmao time
ing
timing
What
06That reminds me of a troll physics strip where he reduces crime rate by burning the laws
06I must say that arguement is in my opinion silly :B
._.
Well
Right and wrong is defined by opinion alone
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/130811898765.png
Whether something is socially acceptable is an entirely different thing
Bored, browsing pony images
Now that is defined by law
06well yeah, social norms can control things to a certain extent but
11okay got to go to sleep maybe i don't fucking know so goodnight or Goodrich thats what the damn correct thought it was i mean how the fuck did my jumble of leaders look like goodrich fuck you correction system i may be bad but not that bad i mean what bullshit ah fuck i just saying whats in my head like anyone gives shit we right so horrable crappy today th
In a way, laws are the "Majority Rules"
06no actual laws (no matter how flawed laws can be) still would lead to more chaos than anything else.
i'm trying to find a good screensaver atm.
But yes, that's true.
06Well I'm sure the majority of us doesn't want it to be totally okay that someone stabs your best friend to death, right?
As I said there has to be a balance
Which was the MLP:FiM episode with the baked bads
Well true
I need to make a reaction picture to that Fox News video
But in a world without laws
Using a shot of Pinkie's sick face
Everyone would have to learn to fight for themselves
Survival of the fittest
Again, Somalia
11that it dosent matter what you right unless your a grrammar nazi then fuck you and shit what am i even thinking about i guess i should stop wrighting but i don't care i do what i want south park
06See, I get what you mean and all but still.
definitely not a perfect world, per se
not ideal either
06Well nothing is perfect or really ideal
That's true
bbl
bbl
06Alright
11i some times think would i have sex with a pony and then i'm like maybe no i don't know i guess i see as more of a love thing maybe if i grew to know one well enough maybe i would eventually trie
11i mean if you love some thing enough why shouldn't you i what
11i got to go to sleep
11soooo bye bn bn bnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnvc

11byye love bronie
hi there, can i ask something? what is the fuss about fox news and bronies?
I don't know
Don't watch Fox News
Google it?
i tried to find something googling it but i found just a lot of rant
Hmmm
That crap shouldnt be allowe to be called news though
They aren't
Maybe it makes bronies feel self conscious
yeah, like this, but i still miss the facts
Only called news by Faux
The problem is our society is still so homophobic, men displaying any level of femininity or interest in female things scares them.
This wouldn't be an issue in Japan.
japan has a different way of dealig with these things...
How so?
here in italy it's not a good idea beeing homo and proud of it, especially in some specific cities
oh i think it's just a different cultural approach
The fuck did all this "bronies are umeployed" shit come from?
in verona, italy, the approach was actually a beating to death
can't remember the year, but not that much ago
God damnit, I hate when news shows and the shit decide to have a report on something like this. Happened to planking and it died.
The Fox segment with the Baby Man only?
Excuse the language
I am glad the world is changing.
Being a brony is less of an issue for me, being female.
Mimeezinga what about the Visual Kei bands?
Are they just considered like Marilyn Manson here?
don't even know who they are
googling
If religious people stopped being so childish about homosexuality this wouldn't be an issue.
Look up Malice Mizer
Hi
well, now... that's just bad taste...
I believe people often like to put others down to make themselves feel better.. pretty pathetic, and that wont change anytime soon
really, but they're so pretty?
lol
Sweetiebell I've been having an issue with such a pathetic person at DerpyChat for the past week.
really, i can't even say what they are... exhibitionists, i guess?
A pony doing that? :(
how do you pm here?
type /msg name message
Bonk.
Yup
got it!
What's up Johnsey?
lalala
mh, nightly round up brings weird news.... valve was conquered by the magic of friendship...
indeed! this is encouraging
Wuts valve?
JackiePie: not much
GABEN
well, if we are lucky they'll put some pwnies easter egg here and there...
GABEN PONY
THE FATTEST PONY EVER
Valve make anything besides Portal and TF2?
Hat Simulator 2*
they run steam and on a certain level encourage indie productions....
I woke up with one of those headaches that feel like someone lodged an ice pick in your brain.
It's going away I think.
I always wake up with a hangover.
I hate Steam =/
It's not from drinking though
why?
Had to get it just to play Empire Total War....OFFLINE
why you hate steam, i mean
oh ok
even dawn of war 2 requires steam
Steam is very useful but also annoyingly intrusive and restrictive
You can pirate games, and run them without Steam, but if you buy them legit you have to screw around with it
the worst are those games that need you to be running bot Stam and Live, bah
actually, i can live with it, because i'm saving some bucks trough steam store
!mbox read 1
That's like rewarding you for piracy.
ARRGH
Yes
wrong channel
It's either that or Microsoft.
JackiePie: So did I.. what a way to spoil a night of dreaming about ponies :(
Funny thing when I went to bed I was dreaming of ponies, and I was like "I have been spending too much time on brony chat"
well, actually i don't pirate games.... so i'm happy when they are cheap
fanfic binge last night... running on very few hours sleep today
I buy games and then remove the DRM from them.
I'm going to the mall at noon.
it's a hell of a work, i buy them when they are cheap and just installe them from steam and play
i don't even need to check for patches
lol I never thought of that!
horses have saddles so humans can ride them
ponies have ... saddles..? because.. it's fashionable? wut?
Like fashion has ever made sense.
but where'd they get the idea in the first place? :I
look, ponies usually are naked
true dat, fashion has a logic all of its own
a saddle is an improvin in any case
Horse shows, I imagine
convergent evolution
*improvement
Somewhere to put saddlebags :P
aren't that just shown as straps in the show?
and actually theyr dresses are cute, so it's ok
Theres even pony saddles on Secondlife for the bronys there
Some types of saddles are lingerie
So are the human avatars wearing saddles, or are people wearing them as ponies?
Ponies from Bronyville can wear them :P They are merely fashionable. (Theres proper pony avatars)
I'm not surprised about lingere saddles, people will find a way to sexualize almost anything on the internet
Even in the show, Spike is going through Twilight's drawers and grabs a blue frilly saddle out of one
lol
What episode did that happen in?
Sweet freedom...morning everypony. ^.^

Hi
Welcome back
Thanks
06seems like it's time to taskkill firefox first .-.
06And you're totally not being the kind of "brony" that people find obnoxious by posting pony reaction images. totally not.
back
i had to break in into my own house
key wouldn't fit
lucky i know HOW to break in :P
06~~
I smell sacarsm
Seriously, not all bronies are like what Fox is saying
I could say a sizable number of them are normal people
NS
06Of course not
06Fox always finds the most extreme example of anything
Espeon
I posted pony images only because it concerns ponies
If it's something else, it may or may not be ponies
Depending on how suitable the image was
06I know that, it was somewhat sarcastic :P
UGH more pony talk x.x
ohai SS
why cant that crap fad die already
O.o
chill out...please
;p
Who? Me?
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25745
him? yes.
/me flees
/me facepaws
/me snickers.
;D
;p
/me sights
GET ALONG
NOW
Nou
BE FREIND
SHARE COOKIES
-caps
i f*cked that up, didn't i?
mhmmm
Is it just me or is it weird singing "everyone" in Winter Wrap Up
wat
hey Sneas
ahhh the ultimate showdown in pony version http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RLm9t-hOPo&feature=player_embedded
Dunno
You know, I was thinking
OMG
All of the MLP:FiM main characters have jobs
--.-
Except Twilight, who's a student
apple optimus prime WIN
So Fox News cooking that up... yup, no sense
WHY YOU NO HI ME.
I am unimportant.
I see how it is.
FINE.
/me idles.
Rarity has her own boutique, Pinkie works in the cake shop, Applejack on her family farm, Fluttershy kind of runs her own animal shelter, and Rainbow Dash is mostly in charge of the weather.
06and this is relevant to anything why?
^
Oh, look at my care cup. It's empty.
xD
/me fills it with water
XD
water != care
Now you will care
;p
/me replaces it with care
/me drinks the water and spits it
/me RUND
/me RUNS*
...
06I mean sometimes I feel like people do not use a pony channel just because they enjoy people complaining about it
06I can see the appeal personally but
06Because tears taste delicious, but still
06And i did not say that's the reason, it just sometimes feels like it ;P
Maybe because not too many people know about it
Join me as in what?
I will respect that you like ponies, but please, stop trying to rub it into everyone's face...
Not everyone cares about ponies, k?
...
06He's not exactly rubbing it in everyone's faces I'd say, but I get what you mean still :P
Rape
Yay.
Well, not rub
But shove it, literally
there has to be a more obvious pony channel
This...this is awesome. XD
#ponies
You there?
Do it, I really would prefer if you guys talked your stuff in there instead of here >:
06I do think that someone interested in it and such should be making it though
xD
You find this annoying why?
Jt
06And I'm personally not annoyed o.O. The only thing a little bit odd is that sometimes things are posted as if everyone cares about it.
It's not so much as MLP being annoying but as to the people who like it being annoying
^
And I basically find what Xeli finds odd annoying
The ponies being posted as if everyone in the whole wide world actually cares
06I mean, maybe it could recruit more forum-goers to join irc too, there's quite a few pony people there..
/me hides
lmao
I eat crowbars.
well
I see a classic in the making
which it shouldnt be
/me runs
06¨No one denies that it's popular
At least you'll never have an iron deficiency
No.
Yeah, well, we're not denying it
Just No.
It will die down, but will remain as a classic
But that doesn't mean that everyone cares
sigh
06It's the way that sometimes youtube links and equestria daily or whatever they're called-links are posted as if this IS #ponies.
The thing is, you're posting the pony stuff just like everyone in this channel cares about it
I really dont think it will go with those cartoons
maybe something more low level
;p
I don't know who doesn't care about it!
I don't.
drf doesn't
06And see, I'm not saying that ponies shouldn't be allowed in this channel.
06But it's obvious that there's enough content to be shared that a channel for it is pretty much natural.
just keep the pony talk to a very very minimum
derp
It WILL become a classic
Annoying as it may be
NOT with those cartoons
if im being honest it doest deserve to be in the same group as those ones
I see this as going through the same phase as when Pokémon got too popular and the hating started
At the moment I think drf and you and HML
Need to tone the pony hating down too
I'm going to do that
But seriously, just join #ponyhaters or what not
Start a bloody war between #ponies and #ponyhaters or something
:D
lmao no...just no.
I'm not that stupid
I know you aren't
I was kidding
06I'm not even pony-hating. I can appreciate the production value and the positive things of the show, I've tried watching it, but I did not get hooked or interested whatosever o3o
06That is all I have to say from my viewpoint anywho
EW THAT FACE
I simply love the humour and some of the characters
/me RUNS
06And /me flops is seriously programmed into my muscle memory :<
re add me to ignore?
You call me annoying, but you need to look at yourself in the mirror first
oh god not again
stop discussing, please
Okay, shut up
06SS you're the reason there are pony fans who are like "every forum is ponychan"
^
06the reactions
Derp.
>.>
im not the only one that hates it as much as me
But really
06Even though I wish that the ones who think like that should DIAF but that's another story
You can be cool when you're not being those things
;p
DIAF?
lmao
die in a fire
NS you're not funny half the time anyways
Read what I said
06die in a fire, not literally of course but I find the "pony spammers" extremely obnoxious.
hi?
lmao
Those are too far, yes
06Yes
o-o
06It all just comes down to
But it's not like I'm spamming ponies to the point of Cubing or anything
and oO
You have to admit
That was a bit extreme
People have crossed ponies with EVERYTHING.
'lo there.
06All I'm really saying is that I don't see why there's not a #ponysomething channel. I mean, it would be more fun discussing ponies with like-minded people without all the complaints and such.
>_>
Almost
06The pony fandom is certainly
06creative
06no doubt .-.
The problem is, not too many people going there
8D
#bronyclub or otherwise
then i'll go there!
rant against me
whassup?
06Well the people who do not care about the links doesn't count as people in this regard (if you get what I mean), so not like there's more people here :P
06But I will totally agree that people blow up too easily at the very mention of ponies
06Now lets just flop over and continue our day~~~
*coughsscough*
yes Espeon

I'm done
Everyone has their own opinions
but too extreme opinions
or overly expressing them
is annoying
and stupid :/
lol
That tends to happen a lot
bbl getting chips
k
funny, I dreamt I still have some potato chips in the freezer last night
But it's empty when I checked
brb, going to get a snack
06That reminds me of a dream I had as a kid to be honest
06I dreamt I had this toy, and when I woke up and realized it was a dream I sadface
06d
06:P
06yay realistic dreams?
^
o laughed
06I prefer the insanely surreal ones though
I have some...interesting ones.
I once dreamt I had a Lugia plush
which I really do want
The only person who i know that has a ton of plushies is RJ
And (PONY CONTENT WARNING) last night I dreamt of MLP:FiM figures that are aimed at adults
oo
i once dreamed i had a lifesize one of those plushies, those BIG lugia ones
Also I found a bag of chips stashed in my home
:D
06I got all the wrong images in my head now
06Anywhoooooooooooooooo
i want a lifesize plush Lugia, that would be epic
what
<%Espeon> I got all the wrong images in my head now <-- lmao
"BIG". My mind.

Hey there.
Dear gog. Everything is dubstep. D: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMtcqfQNd2Y&hd=1
What is dubstep anyway?
Slang for "Remixed into dance music?"
Or something more specific?
It's kind of like two step but more british
...See, if I had legs i might be a litle more knowledgable about your human dancing.
<3
Then again I think two step is British too.. Uhh..
I'm blank over here.
It's to electronic dance music what garage punk is to rock music.
^^
i haz 2 floofcats :3
Just British

Hi
Zirman: whcih song is that?
Equestria girls :3
My ringtone :D
o
Your not a bronie till youv heard it
I showed that to my female friend. She couldn't watch it all :3
It's too adorable. I can't not-smile while listening.

Also i heard Katy parry made a parody of that song
she did?
/me adds these sites to his pony bookmarks

Yeah she did
It's called California Gurls
Yeah. Sad, really. A supposedly talented musical artist taking material from FiM.
It's far from as good as Equestria Girls

~yay~
Sorry

I'm excited for instant Celestia. If it's her saying "Gotcha", I'm so using that in my everyday life.

Hehe
Trolestia
Darnit Muffin
trollestia bestia?
i have a big game minimised, and i have all other kinds of things on
trollestia is bestia
oh god...........its started
now only using 2.70Gb RAM
They have started making pron of derpy
Why :(
lol
Zirman you're a bit late
i know
Still
Yeah
I was jsut hoping
I disappoint it
*sigh*
Hey quick question
Are they really making derpy a charater
She is
Kind of.
No i mean like for season 2
She has been since she was found by fans
I'd say she'll be there
Someone said that derpy was going to be an actual charater
From what I understand, they're going to use a pony of the same color and stuff as a character
Not sure what her name will be or if her eyes will be derpy.
Uhh duh
Hi, Dari
DERPY
They WILL be Derpy
IS
Or rather they MUST
DERPY
no excuses
no questions asked
I tried watching http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul5yF5vAR9M but couldn't after I heard the water monster... I haven't played that game in a while
what is that game?
Amnesia The Dark Descent
I recommend it
I shall see you guys in approximately
ONE hour.

GOODBYE

Oh right
G-Mane is in here somewhere.
Just a small towwn girl.. Living in a lonely wooooorld!
Well i was woken up to a lovely suprise tis morning
Left my T.V on treehouse last night cause i was tired
Woke up and turned the T.V on
BAM
PONIES
I woke up in Luna's bed, all sticky
agai
BAM
Twilight -_-
You need to start locking your doors
and windows
...ok Twilight PG please.
and everything else
I propelled a five-stage Rainbow Rocket once.
including the sink!
I didn't know Gordon Freeman could talk
The Freeman must talk
it was a hot summer's day I was sweating so much. I hope Luna doesn't mind having her blanket soaked in sweat
Then you havnt seen freemens mind
I dont think sweat is sticky.......
How'd you think I got a degree in MIT?
AH HA
you must of been doing sum arts in crafts
in most cases, it can be
And got....glue on you
i guess
i dunno
Uh
Sign language?
im thinking of possible answers to this situation
The same way Frohman did?
the only two signs with words are Open and Closed
Ever wonder what I do in this suit all the time?
hmmmm i need a good pony name.............
:D
Battle evil!
It has internets in it.
Oh sweet
Wait.. That means it has roaming wireless..
Isn't it kind of easy to track then?
Oh Celestia, my jokes aren't as great as Rainbows
er. I mean Dashie
Combine don't use internets.
/me shrug
they just add themselves
why else they call themselves 'combine'?
huh...oh noooooooooo NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
They harvest tasty apples?
Back to drawing ponies
DERPY NOT AGAIN
I JSUT FIXED THAT WALL
-_-

Just leave the poor dear be
its not her fault the 4th wall keeps getting in her way
plus it'
I know
it's Pinkie's job to destroy that dang wall
now i gotta fix my computer screen again
Thats the wall she broke
Hey, at least it isn't ripping out your comic books like Deadpool does.
Shes just standing there all angerly
Pinkie doesn't break, she destroy the whole thing
Destrots it
PINKIE PIE STYLE
so she claims >_>
i just call it utter destruction
Deadpool and Pinkie, those two should be one in the same.. except Mr Pool kills things
I wonder whatever happened to Adrian Shephard. I liked him.
pinkie pies been known to kill
What gave you the idea Pinkie DOESN'T kill things?
your bordem :D
Twilight?
Studying again T_T
She needs to get some friends

or even 2008
as the sketches depicted

Fly well ;)
I prefer running.

Executive meddling will break all
riiiite...
Seeya
*zoom zoom zoom*
I give the new season about a 50% chance of not sucking :P
13I remember lying in bed, staring at the fish tank with one foot hanging off the edge of the bed
You have no idea
13it was 11:48am
how much rage there'll be
if it sucks
13and that's when it hit me
It will be GLORIOUS
13but I can't remember it =w=

06Sounds remembering-worthy |D

Lets hope they dont wreck it.. its good, dont fix it
13I really should write these down as soon as i think of them .w.

yeah!
Ok
13How about you both learn to tolerate each other
13:3
so, i put author name and description.
I won't even care anymore
Hi line
oh snap
Hello there Weir.
*high5es*
an active mod!
13And take him off ignore, because that's just silly IMO :P
Dunn dunn dunn
Oh now I wouldn't go so far as to say that :P
e.o
He's off
Huh what
oh
im back
i think i fell asleep
i think
Wat?
im not sure
Hi :)
Ok, retreats
me?
13And I think you both need to apologise to each other
'ello there Soarin.
awww
13since you've both obviously done something to upset the other
S'goin on outline
one less at the par-tay
13and we can't have longlasting tension between people, can we? :3
Care to join the par-tay
We have games
and butterbeer
and pie :D
and other assorments
Nothing much. Evening. Peaceful. Complete lack of activity.
What about on your end?
Long day
Lots of flying
Wings are tired
So i went on here
11Hey!
11I'm no longer doing pink, plus I removed the numbers from my nick
what wrong?
Thats bout it
All I ask from him is to be less annoying, and learn to tolerate MLP:FiM
who was on ignore?
It's here to stay, like Sonic, Pokémon, etc.
so its evening over there outline
Makes sense. This is as decent a place as any to crash.
But i gotta go later to see my grandpa
Fathers day and all that
there's barely anyone up over here
06That's one thing MLP has down, love and tolerance
I didnt crash here
/me flops
I landed
Whereabouts is "here" for you Ninja
?
eastern US
Ah.
13Tell that to him the next time you see him then :3 Hopefully he'll realise his mistakes and apologise for overreacting to things he doesn't approve of
13I'll make sure to talk to him myself if he doesn't
As for me im breaking the foruth wall
13but on the other hand, maybe it'd be wise for you not to post as much MLP-related content as you have been doing
And derpy has already done that
Along with breaking my computer screen -_-
13since I've seen people telling you to stop
wazzzup?
Hmmm
11DSD?
Maybe
Nothin much bro
its a...party
o.o
I do get obsessed at times
WRONG
its a
wanna be friends?
So what
PAR-TAY
...
Sure why not
good actor Sorin
If someone doesn't like your obsession, don't obsess ;p
it didnt seem very lively
Its soarin
so i downgraded
Like != Obsession, I know
ikno
Dont forget it bro
;P
I know how my obsessions play out
soooo
So?
do u actually have a mlp fim OC?
13I understand, but just try to keep it to a minimum so it doesn't annoy others, 'kay? :P
They will run its course
So
K
first time on this site
Luna having a musical number in se2. Would this be awesome? Y/Y
so i have no idea what that is
good, problem solved :3
im not even sure how to sign up
Maybe
yeah
how do u sign up?
so
13If you really feel the need to post lots of MLP-related content, you could go to the MLP channel and talk about it there :3
do explain what an mlp fim OC is
ok
no signing up, you just register your names
13The MLP fanclub on the forums works too
Oh
K
guys just make up with each
makes sense
other
now about the mlp fim OC
lol
mlp fim OC means: My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic Original Characters
what is that?
uhhhh
no
i dont :/
a character u make up for mlp fim
This isn't active enough D:
i have one
basicly a fan made character
his name is Saphyer
Lemme guess
yup
ya
i have one to, named Ali
Problem is that the channel isn't active enough :(
I want one
We could just send him to #Nobodycares ;D
But im not the best at names
u kan make one
Well find more MLP cultists then
:o
Its just the names
yeah
i can never think of good names
13HML, you're not helping :P
Saphyer is a pegasus
other than jackson or somethin
Sorries :<
little brother of FlutterShy
Well... what are your character's defining traits?
I'm a pegasus
Have fun with him AE then XD
I know that much
Still need a name
colour
Mine's a Unicorn
I mean personality, likes, dislikes...
Saphyer has a crush on Rainbow Dash
/me is in a bad mood anyway, will idle
use a pony genorater then
Oh great
w w w w wait
Ok
Basically, take the most notable from those, and craft a name around that.
gimme idea for a name
who doesn't have a crush on Dash
theres a pony generator?!?!?!?!!?/
goodnight
4Hey
WUT
I LOVE RD!!!!!!!!!!
SEND!
Ok
Uhhhh
Wow okay
goodnight
Lemme think
ok
there's two that i know of, 1 being better than the other
K
06Advertise it on the forums a bit (in PM's or profiles), maybe some of the pony people there will try IRC then :P
I like flying fast, i know that
dang
so
*rummages* hang on, i'll find my character
I have a whole bunch of original characters. But I haven't named them since the players will mostly do that.
13^
what about this pony genertor?
\I think one reason why I'm so into this is that such a good cartoon, with good character design (and I don't mean by just their looks) and such good humour and storytelling hasn't come along in a very, very long time
Anyway
Espeon
idk
I will take your idea
Nii
Hello ruffians!
Good afternoon Fireant
ah!
link to pony generator plz
oh hello fireant
another mod!
13I understand, I like the show myself :P
if there is a link
The people who don't will make the decision themselves
wait
this Soarein person
yur actually a real person?
Hi Dash
Either you prompt them or your don't
and i have no idea what my pwny would look like
11Like the new me?
Understood
13it's the spamming of MLP-related content that's one of the main reasons I don't like the fanbase so much
there's a link to one on EqD somewhere, under the games search
I won't force them
said
mine is a Sapphire pegasus
his mark is raindrops
b5br
damn
Just as long as they don't force me not to like the show, I will leave them alone
oh, hey there Fireant.
i wish i was good at pony makin like that
I won't shove it down their throats either
13I'm sure no one will do that, everyone has a right to like whatever they want after all
AH HA
i think i got a name
i think
Citrus?
i dunno
11I've removed the numbers from my nick-name, plus I've become blue.
something to do with fire or the sun
That's a viable name.
thats what im basing it around
viable?
Pony generator? There's a create-your-own pony flash tool
goodnight anyway
Decent. Workable.
4Nice

Indeed lol
06Shouldn't this be broken into a disambiguation page to separate out the my little pony bronies?99.89.56.13 (talk) 20:17, 11 June 2011 (UTC)

02Nick, It's on the 24/7 playlist. No one is actually podcasting right now xD
Yeah, but just when beginning High?
A little unfair if you ask me.
11Same goes for Skelos Badlands and Wizard Peak
If anything, money for school supplies.
oh
his parents suck. that's my theory
02So you'll have to wait for the next show. Hosted by Green Yoshi later today.
whoops sorry xD
And the field of work for such people isn't.... uh... TOO vast.
Well anyways, I never noticed this before. Is this new?
Just an afterthought.
02Np :3c
02Now...
Not new.
nope
13Ray, every time I look at you you're doing homework ;A;
/me grabs his sword
its been here since THE DAWN OF TIME
Been here for like, ever.
02D:
I know I just noticed myself o-o
THE DAWN OF TIME.
IT HAD PONIES>
you must have nazi teachers Ray!
/me flees!
lots of pwnies
PROBLEM, DINOSAURS?
02xDDD
and i was their leader
the lead pwny
You wish.
If you were their leader, then I'm the Easter Pony.
Or something.
protecting little fledgling n00bs from fireant's scary banhammer since forever
*basket of eggs appear next to me*
Aww, man!
Dang, talk about finding out something interesting so late
a pwny that craps out eggs
wow
I got here before the banhammer.
You get to meet freaky bronies too
4The way i have seen it it looks like they are trying to make different pages for teh games
4AS seen on the SL page
Freaky is in Equestria After Dark.
Here is for non-sensical stuff.
yea
Like NINJAPWNY for example.
4Also someone needs admin
4So we can fix it up
w00t
Yesterday we were talking about nukes.
or sensical stuff, join Equestria Study.
speaking of which
*For
4You take care of being an admin hopefully you can get it faster
Equestria After Dark? Another website I never knew about?
4I'll just work to it
Yesterday there was a war.
^ A chatroom.
i have yet to see the flood of duke nukem pwnies since the game came out
The banhammer was even brought out.
I'm paranoid about joining After Dark. So I'll stick to Study. :I
I like Study <3
hey, fireants busted out the banhammer like 3 times since ive been on
that things frikkin mjolnir
For sensical stuff, but with acting, join RP.
11Yeah, but (with the exeption of Honey Marsh) all the old worlds in SL are the same as the classic ones.
I am also thinking about fourth...
Chzo Mythos!
Like Cthulu Mythos, except with VOWELS.
Y is a vowel
11I follow the story.
Sometimes
Shut it.

GonnastabALLthepeople.jpg
5I probably only have a little time before my dad decides we need to do something. xD
Look at how Aero drew you
/me runs
4Lets get into this
5But I'm hangin' here for now.
Just as I'm about to turn in
Nice
Gonna greet ALL the people!
6aww D:
5Aww. D:
11Well, we've got a lot of work to do, plus we need to talk with Darkeiya and TTEchidna about the Manual of Style
Lovely, quite the Geekdom we Bronies are
XD
6I looked normal :D
4Right
yeah.avi
How about I choose a discussion topic.
Okay?
Fanfics? Are they evil?
Most of the time.
i dont read em
11What where do we talk about this? They are not normally here at the IRC
But you went from like a square headed human to a fish with too many fingers
Saucy usually equals bad.
unless one particularly catches my eye
and def no clopfics
Unless THEY AREN'T GAY.
6well
5 /floof'd D:
I just finished a Spike x Twilight, major WTF
6no comment
^
Meaning STILL BAD, BUT NOT AS BAD.
being floofed is a good thing :D
Dude, get a name.
One Last Day just made me laugh my butt off
This 'user' crap is annoying me.
Fanfics; 95% of them are utter shit, unreadable, self-inerts, or simply dumb.
nah, too lazy
hi Angel :D
5% howver, are pure gold.
Nevermind, I got to go for an hour.
i was too slow with the ^
finding them, is the challenge
:/
like CUPCAKES
:<
Memories of days Long past was good.
I go by the star rating
:>
wb?
theres a reason its legend
I read the higher rated oned
5Okay that was weird. xD; Sorry guys.
the human in equestria one, "Stuck" is my favorite
5I accidentally closed the Channel window and was like !!!!!!!O:
All the Six-Stars are worth the reading. Most of 5-Stars too, however not always.
6lol
5AHEM ANYWAYS.
4Wiki
i said, being floofed is a good thing
4Also i'm not sure they know we are here
4if they do they might be on
5So is anyone stateside doing anything nice for their dad today..?
i gave him aftershave
but i once trolled him on fathersday
Also, I am sad, WE are sad, that whenever anyone throw the topic "Fanfics" it takes less than 10 second to somepony mention Cupcakes.
Yeah that's true, but man am I addicted to TheGoldenCrowbar's Dr. Whoof fics
i gave him pink underwear
Oh hey
Less than ten seconds. Good one.
and pink sock
its oblig
*socks
^^
5I gave my dad a card and a book about all kinds of guitars and basses, 'cause he's cool like that. I marked the Rickenbacker 4001 Bass and he was like, "D: I want thaaaat"
NINJAPWNY, only for troll.
Cupcakes, never read it
5LOL
I ban trolls.
If someone really thinks there should be a feminine version of the word "Brony" could it just be "Bronie"?
5PINK SOCKS XD
and EVERY time someone brings it up, i am going to mention it
I think it should be Sisney XD
User_9568, you may - its not badly written. It's only senseless and therefore, yawny.
trollface.jpg
Not for long Ninja.
5Apparently my gift was more like torture though because it's a book about all the guitars used by pros he'll never be able to afford. xD;; Nyeeeh.
I must now tell you that you are on mods black list.
5 /horrible daughter
:O
6quick, anyone in college?
you have a blacklist :O
4dragon armor or armor?
11Maybe one of us should tell them
5...In two months. o-o
Sure.
We have many lists - organisation is a key to proper work.
6anyone there right now?
Yikes
so, there is a Whitelist too then?
4yea
the guys that are "over the law"
So NINJAPWNY, watch yourself, because at last 4 mods are very keen on kicking you out... FOREEEEVER.
Nope. There is however, the Good Guys list.
Alright, I'm back
awww, i didnt think i was THAT bad
Oh, those ones get a present, right?
;)
Good users that may be chosen to be temporal OPS and HOPS when needed.
/me kicks someone out FOREVER
wait, what did I miss?
Haha xd
04In two YEARS for me
/me runs
kickception?
I just love when people do this
lolwtf
ZekeS is doing a presentation for you.
5I know DRF is but he's out.
what just happened
No worries, he can unban himself ;)
5(I mean AFK or whatever.)
For sufficiently small values of forever
lul
11A fair MoS should work!
ZekeS you really should control this low-self esteem issue of yours.
5Okay, well I'm going to grab some lunch. Back in a bit.
4Yea
probably not.
i'm still trying to get on the GOOD GUYS list, so i can get my present.
Ponies with banhammer cutie marks?
YES
Oooh you get a present if you're on the good-guy list?
what's up with these lists?
i have no idea
Nothing.
No lists.
You read nothing about anything. Keep moving, citizens.
"How to make up things and make people believe it 101"
Denial.
4Also i'm going with Dragon armor
Trollestia
4For the sole fact everything else wears armor
lol
11First thing: we gotta make the pages for the realms in AHT
/me wink at ZekeS knowingly* The less they know, right?
11Armor! I love armor!
man, I'm still surprised I didn't catch those animation errors on some of the episodes
4And everything else
well, at least im INFAMOUS
These are not the droids you're looking for
Move along, move along
^ Win
13I'm in college, but it's different in the UK |D
13I assume it is, anyway
I caught a few of them when I first watched them.
Like Scootaloo's random missing wings.
It's Flash, there's going to be errors.
Yeah Fireant, like if i didn't know that the owner of the chan has actually the mode +i set, so we can't see him.
06I guess I am in the equalient o.o
god, I can't believe I missed those
+invisible :yup:
13!espeon
..that was really bad, i apologize
6ok
and i apologize for not having a rim shot ready.
hey roara
6anyone know what a grade card is
so anyone else going to say anything at all or did everyone freeze?
no
Stop
i am here, as always
Hammatime
I just joined this soo...
NO
change your nick
you're not missing much
I'm here. I'm normally silent.
but deadly
/nick to change
Oky dokey
loki
/nick "username"
I was gonna say Batmare missed out on catching Mr. Freeze
good job
lol no u put your username you want in that field
XD
i bet that was Fireant.
now ur slightly less anonymous
I sense trolling to come along XD
you're half the name of a guy we know
oh great
There we go.
phew
from pokemon you mean?
darn, that was anti-climactic
i was worried for a sec. Do you realize how hard it would be to talk to you.
o-o
Hamcha, why would you assume so!
"hey i know a's grandaughter"
6no, from college lol
Yeah, XD
Someone should be at least SOP to do that.
4Spree
13I haven't heard of one before, sorry D:
6exactly
6I haven't even heard of it
6and
Nope.
6I'm supposed to have one faxed to my college tomorrow
OP is enough.
11Done with Dark Mine
;) See?
ZekeS is having his trollfun :p
So wahddya guys normally talk about here?
EVERYTHING
Ponies.
pwnies
Okay...
keep it PG yo
yea, we're not into clopping
Suicidal Ponies?
little child comes in "Mommy what are these peoples talking aboot?"
Or is that not PG? =S
6heck
depends
6GOOGLING what it is doesn't even help
do the mods have to dust off the banhammers?
Hmmm....
PG.
^?
Banhammers are sanitized frequently. Please keep it clean
Grade card
Mom "MY CHILD HAS SEEN TOO MUCH! GET AWAY FRM HER!"
Strict PG for you.
A card that records your grades?
And you.
And all of you.
Oh hi
6yeh but that could be anything
Hi
6they say it's unofficial
if you want more "naughty" stuff, go to "EquestraAfterDark"
ohai
but it's dead now
yea
is that a website?
but normally its the wild west in there
I remain confused.
It's another channel
6but does that really mean I can just print out my grades from my college's online system
EquestriaAfterDark?
6that seems horribly...not official
/join "Channelnamehere"
#EquestriaAfterDark <-- Double click it
or do that
dear god, the horror!
the things they are saying in there!
it's unnatural!
Whaddafu-
it's unethical!
6I have an issue with that last part xD
6tomorrow is the deadline lol
Well.
yea!
That is why EAD is EAD.
And minors or persons with barely scratched sanity should stay... right,*draw an X* here.
Ya see, EAD is only used in EXTREME cases of... (Trying to think of PG word)
13Well, it's their own fault for not explaining what exactly a grade card is~
clop?
inb4 ninja kicked
XD
6I knowwwwww ;-;
Yo
YOU MUST -
hah jk the PG here means no EXCESSIVE swearing and stuff
Adult oriented chat, pretty much.
Ohhh, ok
yea
*YOU MUST DIE
i can still say horny once in a while here and won't get kicked.
hai
Fireant I know what you're thinking
Hallo

13Latté

12I'm really hungry, oh well I ordered lots of - OMG LOL as I was typing that the food came
the banhammer claims another victim
:3
Oh
13Put down that homework and join the procrastination nation
RandomlyWeir: how can you appeal a transient, already ended action?
6my college doesn't put the term number on this page
11Code mode! Good for you! :)
Hmm...
And how in the hell is a kick the "banhammer"?
ninja banhammer does not kick
I forgot there's no democracy in here
12and hiya everyone /pateish
it bans
There is no banning involved.


1a
more like kicknail, like i said before
hello ray
hmm
12late*
Alright then. Who votes we kick Radom again?
So where are the actual rules for this chat?
HEy!
it's on the to
And i do
top*
what the mods say goes
That offends me
So I just saw a Fruit Loops commercial.
that's the only rule
?
like that scootameme before
It involved a squeaky penguin...
lol i still chuckle when i think of that incident.
OMFG
speaking of which

If the mod says you are an apple, you are an apple.
Pretty crap rule if ya ask me...
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
is flask banned, mods
That I swear looked like Tux, the Linux penguin.
There's a team of 50 people behind every RandomlyWeir account!
i havent seen him in a while
YOU CANT IGNORE THIS!
Oh my.
its me disney
Muted channel.
How sad.
/me 4pulls out his code gun
/me 4charges it
People, less spamming, fast-enters and "LOOOOOOOOOL", more actual conversation.
Cool
02Hi~
...yay
*gasp*
uh?
what did you...
>Fireant talking to himself
entertaining
the chat death choke
+m
If you had to take any one from the mane six on a dangerous adventure, who would it be?
IceMane oh hi
Twilight Sparkle
did he ignored everything?
Rainbow Dash
Fluttershy
she'd be pretty knowledgeable on most things and have powerful enough magic to stop it
honestly i wish you tards would stop typic in constant bold like Nero and RandomlyWeir...
Might i ask why RandomlyWeir always speaks in bold?
BEcause i can
cause hes that awesome
it honestly screams LOOK AT ME IM IN BOLD LOOKIT ME I NEED ATTENTION LIKE TRIXIE
because he wants attention
lol pateish xD
gyarados and snorlax are battling
*deal with it*
Therefore the best course of action would be to ignore him
To answer my own question, Pinkie Pie.
DJMidli i was testing to see if it worked.
I thought Bold would have been restricted to mods
f
What's going on here?
dammit
ponies
pwnies
except ponies :P
Pinkie would make even the gloomiest adventure into a fun time
And so.
We don't do such restrictions.
Anyone doing fine here?
._.
We are easy going bunch, we are.
yeas
No, I need Pinkie Pie so I can break the laws of physics.
Duuuh.
*RanDUMB out!*
you know my favorite way to break the 4th wall?
color in my HP bar
lolololololol
11Enemy template. Don't forget to test it on your Arenero (Sandbox)
with a hammer?
02Done~
13Congrats xD
no with a brush
I talk to the fourth wall a lot in real life
What is the forth wall anyway?
the audience
whatever is between you and your audience
02xD
And here I am thinking it would be the fourth dimension
/me goes to play Osu!
dump me
That's time!
u sure?
/me is lurking... stay neat dudes.*
13beat dem taiko drums
A dimension of sight, of, sound... a dimension of ponies
12zOMG
5Ehwhat?
The Twilight sparkle zone..
You are entering... The Twilight Sparkle zone.
fffsafdad
02I don't like Osu's taiko mode >-<
Engage?
02DS Taiko > Osu's Taiko.
Apparently the Twilight Sparkle zone is a zone where nopony talks.
well..
That means we are in
02Anyway, This song hates meee~ :D

Nothing.
lol
Enjoy ponies.
CONFOUND THOSE COLLEGES, THEY DRIVE ME TO DRINK!
:D
4http://www.spyropedia.com/wiki/Elite_Enemies
4thats how those work
Pony Star wars. I'm thinking Twilight as Luke, Angel and Spike as R2 and 3Po, Rainbow dash as han
Rarity as leia
oooh.
Applejack as Chewbacca?
6lol
old disney is awsome
Secretly, The Marnaxes join the rebel alliance.
Cool idea.
I liked the old mill short
Celestia should be the Emperor(ess)
and Luna vader?
Yupyup
i like wall.e do u?
meh...
Luna is bad again
11Good idea!
12any pixar film is great
Vader wasn't bad
Nightmare Vader
Watch the movie.
12'cept I wasn't a big fan of cars
hahaha xD
tbh
I have only seen the first one, I'm not realy the one to talk about SW
Maybe Fluttershy as Chewbacca and Applejack as Lando Calrissian
I liked cars! D: but it was the only pixar film that didn't win animation oscar as far as I know
And Lyra should be Jabba
Pinkie Pie as Admiral Ackbar
As she is a chubby pony.
12it was okay, the sequel does look much better but I'm just basing that on its trailer
6I actually am very dissappointed with what they're basing their sequel on
6I actually liked cars
6this second one...
6just
6no
12xD I'm not too bothered about it
12But I can't wait for Monsters inc 2 <3
I know roara kind of a odd direction they're taking it
Nightboomfer wouldnt zecora work better as lando calrissian, given the race
6I can't talk though
11The template's not quite finished yet, did you know?
spies and stuff? o-o still seeing Micheal Caine as a spy might be the closest I'll ever see him becoming James Bond
6I didn't expect much for Kung Fu Panda 2, that's one of my favorite movies now
I meant as far as character interactions go
Micheal Caine is win
I think Zecora would make a good Yoda
Actualy I agree.
i think big mac as chewbacca
lives in the woods, a weird way of speaking, in tune with nature
how about the inpossibls
Zecora - Yoda
04Roara
trixie = boba fett
04yes Cars 2 sucks :|
6eh?
that's perfect
6wait is it out?
04no
12owo
04but the concept
04is horrific
12xD
Indeed!
6 10:56	Aurora	I can't talk though <-
6I haven't seen it
6I wont judge
6but from what I know, i'm not thrilled
04They're taking a racer and putting him in Japan
However.
04yeah me neither
We lack one main role.
Obi-Wanna-Kebobi
celestia
/me RUNS
booya
04sorry that was bad
that makes so much sense
i can
5Whoa, I'm distracted.
5Er I was distracted.
on that note i must
pwny...AWWWAAAY!!!
5I probably won't go see Cars 2. I wasn't impressed at /all/ with the first one and the second seems very "lolwut?" to me.
I am so, so tempted.
6I loved the first one
But I will stop myself.
6until my family nominated it as the official family movie
6and we watched it over a hundred times in less than two months
5Haha. Well. That happens.
lol
12Favourite pixar movie everyone?
6incredibles, probably
11lol Ghost!

Cars or TS3
Hmm...
5There are too many good ones. D:

5I SOBBED. o^o
6Up actually scared me a bit lol

13We watched Karate Kid instead |D
12Yeah I saw a bit of it, I'm not sure which channel though
6Karate Kid was an awesome movie
5The original was~
13We watched the remake, not the original
Okay.
6I never saw the original
6I love the new one
5D8
5NEVER?
Wait, YOU got sidetracked?
6never
SOeone took my laptop...
Ah-hah hah hah hah hah.
13I've never seen the original either LOL
5You mean you've never seen the famous "wax on, wax off" scene!?
13but yeah the remake is <3
Who?
5xD;
little sis
5I wasn't too impressed with it.
5But I am this STICKLER for original versions bleh bleh bleh
Now I'm using the main comp
5Unless it's like a planned series or something.
5That's why I will try to avoid watching dubbed movies if I can.
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar.
5It kind of reminds me of going to see a movie based on a book without reading the book first, y'know?
Faaammmiiiineeee
5(Yet another thing I try to avoid.)
13I don't read books |D
so we talk bout ponypocalypse?
5D:
i would join the ponies.
:D
5I read obsessively. xD; It's the only reason my writing doesn't stink completely.
i mean what Nero said
i can't stop talking about TKL
Nice one coz
10 seconds flat
cuz of his name? Coz?
RBD would be proud
/)^3^(\ SO AWESOME
"would"?! SHE IS ALIVE
Coz: Actually, it was exactly 10 secons betwen his hjoining and the /mode +b
5Lol why?
5Because it's pretty much the greatest animated movie EVER?
win
12tkl?
pwny
5Oh wait what
5I misread that as TLK
5xDDDDD
5OOOOPS
12LOL
5I dunno what TKL is
12Neither do I owo
5Well I do know that TKL is a company that can customize instrument cases. Pretty sweet stuff actually.
5But I assume that's not what disney is talking about. =P
13Narcoleptic dogs on TV
13;w;
06That's just sad :<
4Thanks
12maybe it was meant to be TLK
The four ponies included are Pinkie, Twilight, Applejack, and Celestia (and spike)
5Maybe.
cuz i love TLK so much :)
i for one, welcome our new pony overlords
4Page mode
12xD
5OOOHHH SO YOU /DID/ MEAN TLK. xD
5Okay.
Ok
I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest. (Celestia)
the lion king
5It really was a groundbreakingly amazing film. <3
So which pony would be which horseman?
12for some reason I enjoyed it's sequel equally with the first movie
5I still love it~
Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make men slay each other. To him was given a large sword.
5Nyeh. It was all right. /shrug
I am going to go
13I saw the sequel before the original o-o
When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come!" I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand.
5Really? xD
12If I remember, I think thats one of the only disney movie sequels I liked
13Yeah, I had a VHS tape of the sequel and didn't buy the original until much later xD
Soooo, War = Rainbow Dash Conquest = Celestia
And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.
5For like a month when I was a toddler I watched TLK twice a day for a month or two, and then for about three more months I was watching it daily. xD Oh gawd I loved that so much.
5I'm surprised the VHS tape didn't wear out.
Famine= Pinkie Pie
1 more...
Pestilence= Fluttershy
12LOL I was like that with fox and the hound!
Gothya
because of parasprites
Nice.
Nero, y u so bold!
?
Hmmm...
Better?
Let's get down to bisness
to defeat
the huns
12and Anastasia <3
dare they sent me bronies
No, the carebears
huns = ?
6omg anastasia
6yeah, not disney, but awesome movie nonetheless
12Agreed :3
when i asked for colts
Nero... you never heard of huns before?
Sadly not.
what's your grade in history?
-7
I thought the begginig of that movie was a bit dark o.o
...
/me facehoofs
what when all the soviet revolutionaries come for anatasia...
5I can't say I remember that movie.
5But I've seen so many it's nuts. D:
do any of you wear horseshoes?
Yep.
/me facehoofes as well
I just found Halo xover fics
6yeah that movie is really dark, but still so good
PLated with the souls of the fallen.
facehoofs must hurt
5I saw /The Fighter/ last night too. SUCH AN INCREDIBLE MOVIE. Boxing, yeaaaaaaah~
they really do
Yeah, thats why i don't do them.
5WELTERWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WOOORLD~
5<3
thats why i wear magnets as horseshoes
?
somehow they hurt less...
5Anyone else seen it? It won a few Oscars and was nominated for a bunch more.
6I actually do want to see that one
they use MAGIC
06That movie was great o3o
06So see it. Yeah.
5It was really good but it's not exactly for the faint of heart, I'd say.
Binded with the souls of the fallen?
is there any mormon pony that can explain?
13I haven't even heard of it
13;;
11Same here!
MORMONS MUST BURN IN THE FIRES OF HELL.
mormons are ok people
Lets not get onto the topic of religion, as it just starts flamewars
terrible people at a bar though
!muffins
Muffins!! You have any? :3
5You should totally check it out.
I just found a Halo/Office fic.
!muffins
Muffins!! You have any? :3
muffins!!!!
13...Who? |D
Why hello derpybot

6^
Uh oh, derpybot lives
!seen derpybot
Look into my eyes.. 6_9
/me puts her front hooves on Coz's shoulders.
5He was in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.
13But boxing doesn't sound all that appealing to me, so I'll need to be convinced to watch that one xD
wh so i can't talk about lion king?
/me this requires popcorn
13Haven't seen any Batman movies either LOL
6no one said you couldn't
!mail Lurkingear Muffins!
Mail delivered! Thank you for using the Derpy Mail Service 6_9
6we're just talking about other things
!help
yay?
13Heck, I never even saw Titanic until last year
o.o
5Well it's not /entirely/ about boxing. A lot of it touches on other things, like family problems, drug abuse, etc.
!seen zekes
noooooooooo
derpy why
why must you leave
she'll be back
5Oh yeah, and Bale was also in 3:10 to Yuma and Terminator Salvation.
hey! these are english muffins!!!
5As well as The New World (as John Rolfe).
13Never heard of any of them .w.
5Awww maaaan. D: Gotta get you to a Blockbuster Video!
nobody likes lion king
13Yeah I'm very in-the-dark when it comes to movies LOL
4tired
5Or at least scavenge Youtube, lol.
Fancy..
6I think we just had a discussion about how most people adore lion king
and so lurking was trolled by derpy
5You could probably find all of those movies in parts there.
6but we're not gonna talk about it all day
5Inb4 ^
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6wKhdO7R0&feature=related Nightmare Moon's theme
5This is Chat, after all. One topic never lasts. xD
D:
11Yeah, it's getting late here in Australia
anypony up for some Civ5?
02brb, bath~
5And she /works/ at the Imax theatre inside the local zoo.
13I haven't been to the cinema very much either |D
NO
PLEASE NO
6Harry Potter
6in two weeks
5YAY
6 3
wtf
i'm missing 10 coins on cool, cool mountain
6 4
5So far off. ;~;
6lol
13I think I've been to the cinema about 5-7 times in total
5I go to the movies at least two-three times a year.
13and I've said this before, but i lost track of the HP series after the third one xD
5But I'm really picky and will research the heck out of a movie before seeing it in theatres since they're so expensive. x__x
13I've seen some parts of the newer movies, but never seen any of them in full
and 20 people dislike lion king cuz its one of the old moves
5I read all the HP books, starting with the fourth (the previous three I discovered all around the same time) within days of their respective releases.
Have you checked the slide?
06brb food~~
Got the slide
Made it all in one pass
Ok I found them lol
6I'm there like 5 times a year
Secret area in slide?
6but this year may hit 10
5I'm sure more than 20 people dislike TLK. ^^;
There are none in the secret area
Cool
I started HP when it first came out :P
But now I can't find the 8th r
red coin
5Roara, really? Haha.
fml
Been a long time since I played SM64
Good times
wow, SM64, thst's old
Oldy but a goody
5HML but I think I was eight or something by the time the third book came out.
6I've already gone twice for X-Men, Twice (gonna be 3 probably) for Kung Fu Panda, once maybe twice for harry potter when it comes out
64 or the DS remake?
64
5Actually I don't remember. Let me chuck.
5**check
6I can't remember back past may though, what came out
I'm trying to go for 120 stars + all coins in all 15 levels
hey Rolly Polly
It sucks on some levels cuz some coins can fall off the stage
4art for games is always good
/me huggles
i achieved that
4Thats my fav part
4oh and music
5Let's see, I would've been 5 when the first HP book came out.. so...
roll again
OH right
The ski lift thing
6I got that book the day after it came out
6I'm STILL into it
/me 13has a ham, cheese and pickle sandwich o3o
154 coins get
5Hm.. I probably started reading around 1999 or something. Maybe 2000 and then in time for the release of the fourth book, because I remember when my dad came home with it and I was like "OOO: MUST READ NOW".
4Also it shows alot
xD
my perfect Sandvich combo:
Ham, Cheese, Pickles Mayonaise, Curry and onion
lol
Just how many coins are there between the 15 levels (and the bonus stages, for that matter?)
6when the 7th book finally came out
6I was in my room
6for 3 days
4It seems that they did alot of armor
5I was in my room for two days.. 'cause that's how long it took me to finish. xD
i don't keep a stable count of how many there are total
just the one's you need 100 for
5I got it at midnight the day of release (release party at the library, yeaaah xD) and just basically slept as little as possible, ate as little as possible, and just READ.
Aurora whats yur fav chcarater in TLK?
6yeh
6I was crazy about that book
6I LIVED BY FILTERING FOOD FROM THE AIR
4more then we thought or they added
6no in all seriousness though, it was awesome
5I think it's funny that there were big release parties at the local library for the last few HP books but not for any of the Twilight books. (; Says something about them..? /shot
6um..
5Mmhm. Ditto there. (Inb4)
6I actually am not that crazy about Lion King
6I don't have a favorite character
where
4Looks like they might have had four ready
6I've gotten sick with obsessions about it, so while it's a good movie, I'm meh about loving it to death
5I mean "ditto" on that phrase.
Hello hello hello, how are all the fillies and colts today?
oh
sorry
5I don't have a fave TLK character. I LOVE THEM ALL. <3 But I like Scar. Freaking amazing.
2000 something
5And the one Hyena voiced by WHOOPI GOLDBERG. 8DDD
6I guess it would probably be the hyenna-
6yeh
in all 15 levels it's 2092
5(But she's my hero.)
6I loved that lol
6I LOVE her voice
6so much
plus bonus/extra stages and the few in the castle that don't count towards the total, 2672
5I watch The View every morning just for her. xD; /pathetic
5And I got into Star Trek: The Next Generation because of her recurring guest character.
I think my fav in that movie is zazo
5She is truly awesome. |D
bleargh
zazu*
5So lulzy. xD
:)
I wonder if Twilight would like video games
Halllllllooooooooo ppl!!!
13oh wow there's this guy on TV who has a "windsuit" and he makes a living working with a group of people by flying around cliffs and mountains
13like a flying squirrel o-o
Hellos nmm
Collecting all coins, never tried that before. Nice metagame.

nightmare moon has a family?
4 12 42 pm
Question... and a silly one, but is there a "Login" for this website? xD I've tried to find it, but have been unable to... maybe I'm just overlooking it, or maybe it doesn't exist? Simply wondering. o.o
so...if i get this right @ means admin/mod and then % is mini-mod/helper admin?
>.>
Meant for the website. :P Not the irc.chatroom :P
EqD? EqD is based on blogger who is operated by google
use your google login
Oh, ok. O.o Was just wondering.
5Yeah but he's EPIC.
13Villains are often quite popular LOL
5I mean the way he took over the entire pride?
5That's power.
:o
Seth used to have the blogger bar at the top of the ppage but it's gone now, you log in you'll need to head to blogger's website
And then muffin was a mod.
The end.
I'm here on a crusade to find inspiration to write AppleDash Fanfiction. >.>
5He even thought to collaborate with the Hyenas! Of course in the end /no one/ was happy but eh, system's a system.
And to talk about ponies.
6villains are popular
6LIKE LORD SHEN
/me 6barraged by bricks
And... stuff. o.O
Ponies Ponies Ponies.
5GIOVANNI <--- Most epic villian ever in Pokeymanz xD
Well today is father's day and I have a huge family so... when food rolls around you won't see me until later tonight.
O SHHHHHI-
5HE'S NOT VILLAINOUS
5HE'S JUST GREEDY
Hey fireant.
sup?
5AND MISUNDERSTOOD
5o^o
11Yikes. I's 4:15am! Night, DSD!
Nightmare Moon's relatives besides Celly?
but he was mean to zazu and sarabi
Must see.
Blueblood
6well yeh
Blueblood = son?
6that's kinda what villains DO
PARADOX! wooooooos
5That and his mom was too busy holding together the Japanese Mafia to take care of her son and then she was like "O HEY GIOVANNI MY DEAR SON HERE'S TEAM ROCKET KTHXBAI".
He's a duke.
h*
Isn't he?
4Night
5(Okay I'm done.)
He is PRINCE blueblood.
Celestia's Nephew
He's a Royal Pain.
which means that Luna...
As Rarity put it.
oh god...
>.>;
Blueblood's a sham, he has no royal blood
and the whole pride
isn't giovanni italian?
11See ya later!
oh...ok
:p
cos thats a italian name xD
5Lolol I have no idea.
Lets ship Blueblood and Big Macintosh.
and Rarity says he is Celestia's Nephew, but according to Faust he is just some distant cousin
>.>
5I have this idea that maybe one of his parents was Italian and the other Japanese, like maybe his dad was.
5(The latter.)
distant cousin..ahhh
I would say I'm speaking in terms of rl... but everypony knows rl is a myth, there's no such thing as humans
5But I dunno anything about Giovanni's father. Maybe his mother killed him. O__o;
XP
Humans? I'm just a pony stuck in a human suit.
5She's never given a name though, just "Madame Boss".
The zipper broke off. e.e'
I once saw a naked pink ape with its cutie mark printed on a tunic on its chest
Becareful what you say...
it had THUMBS!
The media is watching.....D:
13brb for a while
D:
Fox News?!

:D that was fun
/me o.o
o.o
i should register this nick.
5Mmm, not really.
5But I'm not too familiar with it.
Two of my best friends IRL look exactly like the scout and the heavy
hahah
...
that's awesome
Scout is sexy.
X3
Pinky Pie would be the scouty.
LOOK UPON ME, EQUESTRIADAILY! FOR I, AM, BRONYMIKE!
...
Or the spah...
Tell the heavy looking one to say "Who touched Sasha? WHO TOUCHED MY GUN!?"
No.
No sir.
I will not look at you.
*upon
>.>
Ahahaha.
why don'T lik ben10
But I made an Ultimate Showdown PMV.
... x3
Nice!
I am belovéd
PMV... Pony Music Video?
Yeeeeup
!eciN
Yeah.
I kind of want to see a PMV of the ultimate... other thing
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RLm9t-hOPo
hi Kosovo
>>
...
The Ultimate Orgy? Yeah, lots of people have said that, I never actually watched it.
And THAT is the kind of quote Fox News wants.
5Never really appealed to me, I don't know. And like I said I don't know it very well.
~_~
6I like Ben 10
oh hold on...can this IRC handle symbols?
its funny when gwen tell ben a duffies
6I'm amazed we're discussinf this lol
O.o
6but only the first episodes
It can handle ponies.
So maybe?
To the character map!
6after a while, it got stupid
5Hmm. Like so many things... xD;
Man, I sure do love going down to the park with my ponies, picking up little girls, tying them up in my van, and forcing them to sing the show's songs with me.
Also I am on disability and I'm an immigrant
hi Nick :)
And I'm an antipatriotic Atheist.
06Nom
erm disney, i'm having a hard tim understanding what you'r saying, and i believe i'm not the only one, could you please mind it? i think it's not even allowed to speak like that (check the MODT or site rules)
that is homosexual?
and burns bibles
5I don't really watch much TV besides broadcast dramas and a few cable dramas. I haven't seen an animated series in yeeeeears.
I vote democrat!
>.>
And born out of a mixed-race family
I vote for Applejack + Rainbow Dash fanfiction.
Appledash is probably the best ship.
i lik the origino
Though something I'm surprised I haven't seen yet:
Oh... I have informed opinions of my own, and vote according to policy!
Spikejack
I like Trixie+Twilight.
5Like I'll watch Fringe, everything on USA Network, I'll be watching Falling Skies on TNT tonight, Leverage on.. ah.. what is it, TNT?, Modern Family, The Middle, etc..
Fluttershy x Everyone just because it's adorable
Thing is, Spike+Applejack actually seems like it could happen.
6TV shows?
Spike's too... Spike.
5^ Yes.
>.>
6I'm a CSI/Criminal Minds/NCIS junkie
Plus the show shipped him with Rarity.
xD
O.o
Spike/Apple Bloom?
NCIS is awesome
...
5I like NCIS but I don't watch any of those regularly. xP
6yep
Same here :P
Yes, but it's clear Rarity isn't into him, I'm thinking he'd work with AJ. See,
i watch it everythime
5All my favourites from this year got canceled. :C
6I found the first two seasons at target for 15 bucks each
6had to buy
my mom always slaps me like gibbs does by Dinozzo
xD
Found this thread on Ponychan http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/35823453.html
6lol
5V. The Event. No Ordinary Family. The Cape. ALL. CANCELED. ;^;
6my family tends to slap each other around like that too
Rarity isn't into anyone except herself, but given her experience with AJ in Season 1, it's possible to ship AJ and Rarity together... granted, they're like Yin and Yang.
6oh
5LOL. xD
6and i have an accurate counter for HP7
At the end of Ticket Masters, Spike runs out with his ticket all giddy and whatnot, then acts cool in front of Applejack, who just kinda brushes it off. Then there's the whole "ho-ho, there, lover boy" bit in Diamond Dogs
щ(°д°)щ
"Shut up and kiss me, you idiot!"
YES!
muhahaha!
6cuz thats the same day a contest entry is due
it works!
6 3 weeks, 5 days
6:D
/me 6runs
5I think literally every broadcast Scifi got canceled except for Fringe. All of them.
6best breakfast ever: bowl of reeses ice cream
and i lik upgrade he's alosome
5But I've been recently getting into MTV's (yes, MTV) Teen Wolf. It is a really, /really/ good show. You wouldn't believe it on MTV but it IS. Fantastic Dramedy/Action/Scifi.
So wait, how the hell do I register a name on this thing?
5AND IT'S PRODUCED BY THE GUY WHO DID CASTLE. Well, co-produced.
6we were watching teen wolf in the break room at work
6I only saw the first 5 minutes of the opening pilot
I'm a proud bronie... infact, this is my ringtone. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GFpFNBqj2M
6so still dunno much aout it
X3
5(As well as Star Trek: Deep Space Nine but uumm... xD; Yay Rene Echevarria.)
5Roara, I think it's worth checking out.
6...
6WHAT at that last name
:P
5Echevarria?
6my best friend at work, that's his last name
5Really?
∞
5How 'bout that!
I'm OK with shipping. The girls seems roughly college-age, and even if they're not into other fillies, College could lead to more experimentation
6I was JUST talking to him about how i've never ever ever heard that name before
6like, yesterday
6cuz here in my town, we have mainly common names
:/ IJMO
6WEIRD
6anyways
5Yeah, I pretty much idolize R.E. He's a really good writer and has done some epic screenplays.
IJMO?
o.o
just my opinion
Oh yeah
Genderspecific names! Brony = male, Bronie = female. :B
I usually use filly and colt
filly-brony/colt-brony?
∂x/∂t t²+x³ = ???
you have ten seconds.
aeiou
Refresh button ate the chat.
and then brony itself is gender-neutral otherwise?
/me 6chucks a spoonful of ice cream at RP's FACE
So wait, there's a term for a girl fan?
Nope.
5o-o
http://goo.gl/Y4Jtr
Likewise, there's no term for a boy fan.
Yeah, usually brony is gender neutral
5Lolwut?
6dunno
6I'm eating some
For males and females of all age
6felt like FLINGING
5I want sooome. D:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RLm9t-hOPo
5 /scrapes off of face
I want a few t-shirts, mostly with just Rainbow Dash's and Applejack's cutie marks.
just 'cause y'know I like whoring out my vids
Or with the character on them.
But no desire to collect the toys or anything.

mmm
Ponies!
5xD
Revolver.
next time will be longer.
Flank is an anatomically incorrect term for horse butt
5HERP DERP
For what, exactly?
Revolver.
And can you kick just be nickname?
Have a nice day
caps
you know why.
Snowball is complaning that he was kicked too.
he has your ip
you were Ip banned for 5 mins
Yeah, I know.
How are you guys sharing comps
afk bathrooms
Life is hard.
5(Pipe'd~)
if you have the same IP?
I'm using his sister's computer
He's using my other-
:l
I beat ya
:?
so don't get each other kicked! <_<
>:l
tough luck, maybe you'll be a bit more considerate about your actions then because they don't only affect yourself.
Hey, he was complaning, not me.
/me feels violated because of caps lock
Pinkie Pie drives Gods to drink themselves drunk.
You guys are like siamese twins
one of them gets kicked, so do you
No.
:l
New Topic - Would you want to have a Pony?
so... predicitons for season 2?
Too expensive.
then why both of you were kicked?
I predict Trixie's return.
I live in Kanada he lives in USA
5Oh~ Welcome back/Hi you two. :3
Eew, owning one?
Predictions for season 2?
hi
And that the show's writers will ship Rainbow Dash and Applejack together.
Slavery is bad.
Innit.
mkay?
Amen
And make a show based on accepting friends despite personal preferences.
>.>
-3-
No... I mean yes... I mean... slavery is bad.
>:l
SEASON TWO wil have one episode MUHAHAHHA!
>.>
>:L
Season Two will have ponies.
I know this much.
Then when's seson 3?
Who cares?
IN THE FUTURE
Next year
>.>
harhar
I can't wait 5 years ago to see my movie
Season Three will leave Lauren Faust in even less control.
How do you know?
Season Four will have hoomans.
The cutie mark crusaders get their cutie marks, rainbow dash joins the wonderbolts
Myabe she will be back
and applejack's truck
will make an appearance
Season Four will have WHOmans?
5...I just got this weird surge of pride. I finally made it into the Top 10 for Chatstats.
5 /shot
D:
5YAY
Not the Whos!
5I HAVE NO LIFE.
Can you do that?
Dr. Who crossover in season 3
XD
Dr. Whooves becomes canon.
Ponies.... in tiiiiiiiimmmmmeee!
Can you make me explode with awesome twice?
/me understands that feeling to both of those comments
Nope
3 time!
Yerp
4 time
I predict more breaking of the 4th wall in Season 2.
5But it's been /years/ (at least a couple) since I made it to the top 10. ;w;
Next thing we know, Memories of Days Long Past will happen.
Rainbow dash has a coming out story, Rarity moves to canterlot, Applejack has a coming out story, and Spike Becomes a Dragon with a beefy arm
With all this time.
ahh
Wth
sftre
:l
/me never has
are you guys doing?
5But I don't have that many posts in the forums because most of them are in the RP board, which doesn't count. :C
RD can't be gay. It's against children's show rules.
12This is going to sound really stalkerish
Besides, that's fanon assumption
5So um yeah. But I should probably post in the forums more because I have been a member since freaking FEBRUARY 2007.
I'm just paraspriting
i think shipping in general is against kids show rules
Hello, Logic.
I don't have many posts either
What?
no, there are definately relationships in kids shows.
Nope.
Come to give us all a harsh lesson?
not even 200 and I've been a member since Dec. 2008
:o
12But for some reason I remember a few names from .co.uk (I was mainly a lurker back then) and I'm sure you were one of the names I remember
cripes man, the hub summer promo has two cartoon charas KISSING
5My username over at .co.uk was Unipaluverno2.
5(Don't ask.)
12ah maybe not you then
OSNAP
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKjBViIt-y8
hide ur wife
5I ONLY posted in the Roleplay boards. xD
hide ur kids
12something like that
12haha XD
so no, shipping is NOT banned in childrens shows
hide yo logic
:3
Yeap.
just Gay shipping
I love how RP boards don't count but forum games do XD
12I knew about this website ever since I got the internet, I just didn't join for a long time and got more active lately XD
No ogic for you
which is really hypocritical
But MLP has the 'Edumucation' tag.
5That's where I met Dallin (Pikachu_Gunner or some variation of that) and Icester, I think that was his username there too. And LiveToPlay2005 (I think that was Tanner's username on the old site).
4MY CONNECTION TIMED OUT, WAT DO
Lol, I ust noticed that Logic exited and Imagination entered XD
12Livetoplay is a familiar name
DJMidli: My main problem with shipping is just when it's done with fanon assumption using stereotypes about tomboys :/
lololololol.
It gives people morals about kindness oh who am I kidding? PONIES!!!!!!!!!!!!
What?
4Oh, haha, I thought people were active in the thread. Well, I feel like a klutz. Oh well, goodbye everybody
You focus on Fluttershy too much.
5Yeah, Tanner, Dallin, and Icester all quit around the same time. For a while we all were on our own forum but we had issues getting new members (i.e. getting them to stick around) so it died a year or so back.
Lord-Blazer tbh at least the fan-fiction writers break down gender barriers.
No...
Everything is possible with IMAGINATION
You just said Kindness.
:o
12Thats a shame
That's Fluttershy's thing.
Imaginaaaatttion
Leave some for the rest of us.
Not logic, how so ever, XP
I'll give you that, DJ, but it just bothers me when they use stereotypes and magically label RD as being a lesbian
5(...Or was it two years ago..? I dunno.)
So If I said honesty you think I foucus on Apple Jack?
I'm not a dust rag :<
Same here.
well we can agree on one thing
12Either way at least you guys are still in contact ^^
Gilda is lesbo
Now the question is, do you have an issue with RBD being a lesbian if done in a gender-neutral manner?
5Mmhm.
That would be odd, Snowball, but probably.
12brb, checking on bath
I have no issue.
I wouldn't have an issue
5Sure~
/me 5waits around.
Issue with what?
Problom?
But it's the community itself that's labeling her as a lesbian, using very retarded reasoning
DJ, probably. It's annoying that she's percieved as a Lessie in general.
And some people that watch this show aren't gay.
SOME people.
SOme...
*Such as myslef*
I don't see her as that, much more than I percieve other ponies. Though I wonder what's wrong with her being a lesbian?
*Myself*
Okay.
Read the topic guys.
There is nothing wrong
12Okay it's fine, back ^_^
Hey, Not even I would like everyone. some.. *whimspers*
Just saying that the reasoning used is bad
Fireant too far off PG?
DO you see the PG mark in it?
5Oh hey, cool.'
hey theyre being very professional about it
We are treading on thin ice gentlement
5I actually have a PM to reply to on the forums, soooooo BRB. xD;
men*
I do, Fireant and this has been a very civil discussion about the show
I thought the PG mark was just to prevent clopping.
change of topic is in order
Mentlegen?
No insults has been thrown around
It's not so far off, but please, contain it within the borders.
GentleMentleMen.
Fireant I will ^^
12Okay dokey :3
Okay.
I'll try.
Mrph Mmmmmmmmmmrph!
also anything said after my last post I missed.
yea how about using the japanese version of PG?
the one where i said we are in agreement
Why isn't that PG if straight couples can discuss.... whatever. Topic changing
Gentlemen? *packs mouth full of cigarettes*
No Id say using the "Euro-Canadian" definition
Japanese would allow clopping, would it not?
heck
04I just had 8 eggs
04|D
there'd be a lot more
Them japanese.
:I
so crazy
:l
All I can tell you about zis next procedure is it's EXCRUSIATING!
did u see the story that they came up with poo steaks?
lolwut
wait what/
?
Yeah, what?
and some of revolvers response as well
I dun get it.
http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/06/17/japanese-scientists-create-meat-from-poop/
what?
Oh.
seriously japan
the
what.
I see.
WTF
fuck?
DAMNIT JAPAN
I don't want to go to Japan now
I haven't wanted to go to Japan since January.
and the worst part?
they had a test panel TASTE TEST THEM!
It tastse lick cotton candy?
What I wonder is if Bronies are supposed to be about love and tolerance, why is discussing gender and sexuality in a rational mature manner not considered PG? Am I overreacting here, or is there a stigma about exposing children to the fact that gay people exist?
:o
oh we're waaaaay past that
current topic: japanese poo steaks
now we're talking about eating poo
To late o save this chat room now....
We can't allow that for some reason.
but seriously
poo steaks
I
Just
threw
up
in
my mouth.
Nightboomfer rules are rules and we have to follow them regardless.
And I hate Lesbians not because they're gay, but because they take all the hot chicks for themselves.
Nightboomfer, overreacting you are, but on other things - I didn't told you to stop the discussion, but reminded gently to keep it withing the borders. Just to be on a safe side here.
omg
its a full scale flame war
JK, I don't hate them.

7Hey, Aero.
WHOSE pony do you like?
Try using "which" instead of "whose"
words are words.
You asked WHOSE.
Sorry, wrong word then.
Is possesive noun.
Ilike Lauren Faust's ponies
RD is my favourite.
Obviously?
Fluttershy
*shrugs*
CogWeaver's favourite is Applejack.
Hard to choose... I say Scootaloo, by a wingtip.
Pinkie Pie.
Out of the Mane cast?
7Hmm...
Too close to pick.
7Is it possible to do multi battles over wi-fi in Pokemon?
Least favorite? Rarity
Who?
umm, no
not that I know of
I mean, give me both.
Rarity is awesome.
Fluttershy, obviously.
Still at the bottom of my list.
But awesome.
I dislik her because she is a fashonist and a Drama Queen
Actually, she's at the bottom competing with Fluttershy for fifth place.
RD is in first, obviously, but Applejack is trailing not too far behind in Second.
Then it's Twilight, followed by Pinkie Pie.
Then, as I said, Fluttershy and Rarity competing for Last.
Einhorn is German for Unicorn
We realise this.

Although, who here can imagine him as a pony?
John Lennon, maybe, but Ringo Starr?
Now back to Eureka :D

Already done.

does anypony think that the negative attention recieved from the press will continue?
HeinousActsZX: what do YOU think
!help 3
:P
meh, the press will always be negative
Most likely, HeinousActsZX
Yes, but it'll die down just as quickly if we don't give them the reaction they want
cause almost all media is negative or tries to find the negative for the most part
What about murderers?
People who actually, y'know, hurt people?
Go put some press on them. e.e'
I think it's gonna get worse before it gets better...
they want to view us as immature manchildren. If we don't respond, they will stop because there's no more news stories
12Wb
That's not the way it works Night.
03just got back from a NASCAR race
You respond, then it must be true, if you don't respond, it's just further proof that there's something to hide, so it must be true.

I just don't want to end up like the furries: Normal people who are constantly ridiculed.
03k
Remember when Gamers were under attack by the press?
Just makin' sure one couldn't make DerpyBot endlessly send messages to herself
gamers are still attacked by the press I think?
wait did you guys STILL not get your eevelution from DW? o0
Gamers took that attention and starting giving back to the community, making sure that everyone knew that they were gamers.
I got mine the second day!
03Nick, the thine broke
But I can see that she's loop-proof
ah yeah i tried to prevent that, although it does react to unkown ! commands.
13Nah, stupid error thought we weren't qualified
the thine?

oh really?

03yeah same
right so a programming error?
ah, well it only goes *derp* 6_9
I'm just afraid is all
yeah
I don't think that's a problem
03Like I said, the thing broke./
yes, but no one seriously believes that gamers are bad anymore. Maybe those who are so set in their ways they can;t accept them, but the public at large is now more open
but i might be overreacting
hey everybody
hi rc
howdy
everypony*
Anypony else find themselves addicted to that Pony Touhou?
yes LQ!
say
appe
apple
At least I know I'm not alone.
oh, typo in the welcome message
pony Touhou?
yesh
i guess no body ever reads it lol
HAHA RC, EPIC
On a different note, anyone going to the Connecticon?
That MLP vs. Starcraft 2 Bullethell
ty!
So as I posted on the FB bronies page: ProFB open bronies.
I want to organize a brony thing, but I don't know anyone else.
most epic on MLPvSC2 Rainbow Dash
It's like having an infinite supply of man cards.
:P
Maybe we can do a worldwide brony thing, or we can all release videos about the community. Make our arguments sane and rational
hmm
Will people listen?
I doubt that they will
Yeah...
If enough of us do it, it's like anonymous
except possibly gamers
they may not respect us, but they'd listen
if we all release videos and whatnot, it would be another one of those things the public will see as "those crazy people trying to make themselves seem normal"
just saying
haha
its how the public sees those kind of things
:D
thats trie
true*
:P
hi disney
of course, I guess anime has largely become more acceptable as well.. so possibly *shrugs*
hm
All right, sorry. I'm just trying to throw ideas out and see what sticks
If people would just watch it, even if they didn't like it, they'd realize why WE like it.
12It said I had to wait until early july or something
Now then. Back to Pony Touhou.
But that's too much to ask...
im gunna DL rite now
haha lati:D
Maybe, I've had some friends watch it. One says he can't stand it - but he does have odd tastes in things. Others get bored
/me is bored*
but in general, I suppose most don't hate it, or really see any reason to hate on it (much)
One of my friends just hates cute, girly things in general, but he says he can see its appeal
I showed him flutterrage
heh, nice
That's better.
I think the first few episodes are some of the best to show really. Show started off kinda epic
Yeah, I would probably not have been hooked if I hadn't watched episodes 1 and 2
Really? I prefer the "Slice of Life" episodes.
The CMC episodes have something going for them in that they actually portray the characters as KIDS.
*opens Pony TouHou ZIP*
Yeah, I love how realistic the character interactions are
I think sonic rainboom was the first episode I saw. Liked it well enough to try out more
Rather than miniature but somehow wiser adults.
Lati i said hi
It actually admits that yes, kids are dumb.
I could see that Falcon
12Hi? I swear that says "haha" XD
i saw the first episode first
12but hello anyways :3
I haven't actually SEEN that in a show before, as far as I can remember.
I started with Bridle gossip. When the ponies reacted to Pinkie's singing like normal characters would, I knew I would love it.
didnt like it but i stuck through
how old are the mane cast supposed to be anyway? I remember reading somewhere that rarity might be as old as 20 or so in human terms
I think they're roughly college age
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_lL9F4wiOQ&feature=feedlik
google time
Dog and Pony show almost killed me (I think it was the 3rd episode I saw)
Sounds about right, Night.
http://pinkiepie.bronibooru.mlponies.com/data/834e74f493a8dc19e5217d3ed4f288ba.jpg
but Rarity does eventually grow on you
or me anyway *shrug*
Twilight is doing independent study, Rairty, Applejack and Pinkie all have jobs
Sky~
:>
the mane cast are 40 years old
lwlz
they need to be taught FRIENDSHIP
seriously? 40?
No.
e.e'
Fid, that's converted to human years, which is nothing to go on in this show
oh lmfao xD
Faust said that they were within the range of 18-22
I know plenty of humans in their 20s who need to be taught friendship
ah, cool Cog, seems about right
I think she said that Twi was specifically 18 or so...
So... uh, favorite pony songs? mine's Winter Wrap up
03http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=7123.msg270194#msg270194

WWU and at the Gala
03I seriously want to hurt someon e
8-bit version ftw
03for assuming that news article came from FOX News
03because it didn't
and giggle at the ghosties
Winter wrap up is pretty cool. Haven't listened to a lot of remixes though
they are 40.. we must accept the fact that they female man children who know nothing of social interaction!
thought Equestria girls was pretty funny
l fiddler
also Flutterguy's version of Evil Enchantress
lol*
03people are all "OMFG YOU IDIOT YOU WATCH FOX NEWS?" and I'm like, no, I watch a station called WJBK
Fid...wtc?
i know things
lol
Faust said it herself, they were within the 18-22 range
Equestria Girls was awesome 'cause of the shout-outs. Had me in tears.
:o
thats even worse
it was actually pretty well sung too, honestly (Equestria Girls)
What's worse?
My face? Indeed.
aww
<|:B derp. Selfburn'd.
:(
they are 40 year olds who ACT LIKE 18-20 year olds!
...i liked equestria girls
*facepalm*
GOOD JOB DRF >:(
lmao
Things MLP has redeemed for me: The words "Twilight Sparkle", california gurls, and the my little pony franchise in general
also animation'
like*
no, Fid, she said their ages WERE IN ACTUALLITY 18-22
"Ow, I burnt myself!"
Hey, Sprinkles
link?
Hey, Dust
one sec
?
Dusk*
sorry
it's one of the notes or whatever in her DA account
lemme find it
03I edited my post with some links to verify that I didn't just make stuff up
WTF i wanna play pony touhou but it keeps crashing -_-
All we can definitely confirm is that Fluttershy is a year older then pinkie pie
speaking of academic things about the pony.. I don't quite get why Twilight has a seperate singing voice talent
lawlz
6...XD
Yeah, the animation is the best I've ever seen in a cartoon, Bar none
I thought Tara Strong could actually sing pretty well on her own right
And Pinkie Pie's birthday is a day after Gummy's
Yeah, I think people are just bored when they bash Fox, I don't really mind/care about it :P
my view of the mane cast is now horrible
Well because Animators stepped up to Flash OSX awww yeeaaaahhh
They probably record multiple episodes in a row and don't want to damage her voice
Gummy needs to be shipped with someone.
atleas we still have derpy
Gummy Shipped with Macintosh.

what?
GUMMY X GILDA
that makes sense Nightboom, she does have a ton of lines
Gummy x Angel?

Derp.
lol
I derp'd
Gumberg is my otp
lol
im still laughing at gummy x macintosh x3
gummy knows what the mares want
Gummy is absolutely adorable... some of the best part of that episode is Gummy's random antics.
xDD
Like bouncing around on a balloon.
Gummy x Bucket of Turnips
ha
Can we all agree that Lyra X Bon Bon is adorable?
Gummy x Rocky
Gummy x Rocky

i can see it in a fan fic now
i just look up on lugia merchandise and i saw lugre lugia plush toy and its so huge and i want it if i can
i want to read these fics
:D
I wish the Pinkie Pie toy came with Gummy
You know, I was thinking about that NPR thing.
>>goes to go grab an alcoholic refreshment. On that note though, I imagine BigMac has some mean distilled cider around there somehwere..
gummy carresed rocky`s coarse hair as if she had some...blah blah blah
What about it?
uhh
I think it would've been awesome if the caller had been like "I know about this because I am a brony myself!"
There is a fanfic on FF.net where that is the case.
But what can ya do.
Luck of the draw.
"Guardian of Equestria" last chapter
"Gummy admired his grizzled chin and rugged good looks..."
human wants a drink and big mac points him to the back of AJ's apple cart
wah?
and it has hard cider
this is getting freaky
Eeyup
it is
...
Apple mead is extremely delicious
Time to change topic.
so...
Ponies.
How do they work?
Magic?
They are made out of gel and balljoints
mm applemead

I imagine they do work on some kind of magic basis.. even earth ponies.. on that note
Gummy + Princess Celestia.
wow lots of bronies on dA like my FOX news pony pic lmao
not even speaking about Pegasi and flying... wingspan and bone issues.. etc. Answer: magic

I have art that I really think is better.. but the first pony pic I do... bam, 100 favorites in 1 day, O.o
Goku's a kid
i love lugia and simba<3:)
you probably do i just started yesterday
(no, not than you, relative to the pony pic I did)
Ponies are made out of a gelatinous bacterial stack than can adjust to any situation, but must remain fixed around a cartilagenous skeleton comprised of full-range balljoints. A cutie mark is a localized section of bacteria created when a pony's special talent activates laten genes in their brain chemistry
sorry, worded that wrong there :)
Ok I got a question. Princess Celest raises the sun over Equestria, and Luna raises the Moon. However Equestria is only a country. As stated by Twi. So how does one country of ponies have the right to rule of the moon and the sun? and only be a small country of ponies?
6XD wow

Maybe the pony world isn't really as big as our world
p_n_
Maybe ponies are the dominant species on the planet, and they are localized in equestria
like a one-world-beneficial-dictatorship
>:(
Ok but that doesnt explain the size, How big is the country? It seems rather small seeing as they dont usual have dragons?
MAZIN KAIZER
n_ w_r_ n_t d_ing th_t ag_in
ok well im gunna do some summer chem homework i really wanna get an
indeed.. and if there were a lot of dragons you would think they would be the dominant species
User_9692: it's because it's a show, and while we're allow to overanalyze it all we want, that doesn't mean that it has to make sense in entirety
____ ___'_ ___ _____ ____
Theyre seem to be a land or lands of dragons in which dont live in Equestria

remember your stoichiometry :)
I wonder how they eat and breathe, and other pony facts

i was in class and they were teaching it i was just like o.o
It's not my only crossover, either
p orbital is my waifu

TALK ABOUT PONIES
NOW
ya it does!
p oribital is my waifu is about the geekiest joke I've heard all day... and I laughed entirely too hard about it
p stands for pony
duhhh
I was!
pony CHEMISTRY derr :p
chemistry has to do with nearly everything :)
Pony orbital
yes
q is for pony
this statement is false.

we must make a ponyodic table of elements
except possibly gravitation... and maybe like unified fileds
>>fields
this has no clear, direct relation to ponies
:P
:P
So is there another nation of Ponies other than Equestria?
possibly
wherever zecora comes from
I've seen a ponyodic table of elements... dunno the link, though.
yeah...
some place
twilightadium sparkite <- First ponyodic table element
Pony equivalent of africa
So does Celestia and Luna rule them?
is someone is talking to me were is verebody
hmmm
idk
Celestiadium
THAT is a question
You would think they would. "NO SUN FOR YOU!"
imon a roll here
lunadite
Seeing as she raises the sun only for Equestria?
erm

Speaking of Eeyup, I love me some Big Macintosh
I hope he gets more lines
Jake sully, we're sending you to a mysterious planet. We call it Equestria, and in order to run with the natives, we have designed a specially made avatar for you
im in the process of turning a friend :P
you guys are my VERY best friends
ponies in 3D?! :O
ILU too fiddler
an Avatar remake with ponies??
neat. As long as it's well done 3d and they don't do a "The last Airbender" on it
god it was terrible
that...actually sounds like it could be pretty cool...
hey, ponies, what's shakin'
1/10 ive never seen such bad reviews lol
what a twist!
02OoT Normal, or OoT3D?
who has watched bolt?
exactly... dang you M. Night. twistalon
M Night Shamylan's cutie mark would be a reel of film twisted in the middle
/me glomps Kosoveon
haha
Night Twist is a cool pony name :V
/me is so bored, he's tired, and is so tired, he's bored. It's a vicious cycle...*
wingzero
?
all your moon are belong to us?
no
just no
put some headphones on and pandora it up while you watch over us Mr Cog. It'll ease the hours
lol... all your moon. I see what you did there
d...did you just call me "Mr Cog"...???
lolwAT?
The moon is out!
perhaps -.-
heh
/me charges the satellite cannon.
Oh god what is this Derpybot D:
/me fires the orbital friendship cannon at ST_Falcon's satellite cannon*
ahem, let me correct that: Cogweaver, to make no assumptions
So.. I've taken over Ponibooru as Nightmare, next stop, Ponychan.
mmk
have you taken EqDaily yet?
haah?
Yes
I've teken EqD's comments and IRC
*taken
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
k
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3e3mzsL4Ks&feature=related
hey who's not talking anyone
I don't think this quite counts as a 'takeover'
I mean, you're here
but that's about it
lol.
This is probably often asked, but does anyone have any idea when Season 2 is supposed to air?
True, Present
6Looks pretty good. I'll probably keep reading it when more is written.
December.
That's what I've been told.
I thought it was earlier than that, Septemberish
Dang, that's a long time to wait.
you're gonna have to take over Fireant or Zeke or Seth if you're gonna take over IRC
But thanks
I think they just started animation
they have
so I would assume -at least- late fall
just started
and hi Ray :D
I'm kind of nervous about season 2 :S
O.o
What?
What's the process? Do they animate first, or do all of the speaking?
I've been dunking my brain in all this awesome fanon
Is it up on youtube?!
/me needs to rest for a while...isn't feeling well
I'll be back on in an hour or so
and then to go back to canon...
they expected to air the first episode around mid-late october
I call it a successful takeover. No other nightmare moon has really stood up to challenge my nightmare moon-ness. I suppose people don't like playing villians. Funny when you think about it, I was quite pathetic as a villian. My galaxy mane was cool though.
they may very well screw up things like... Luna
I don't think staff has been shaken up that much, besides Lauren anyway, who still had some say in Season 2
have a good rest, Kos
02'k~
I hope Luna is done well
Galaxy mane is sweet, yes
that character has potential.
thanks
and be back in a bit
Cosmos' galaxy mane is cooler
and he's a good guy
so :P
well, enjoy your takeover. we probably have muffins.
Thanks

you're not Luna
12Anyway anyone know a RELIABLE one?
03what game? I can find you a link
03in all honesty
no, only applepie
12Where from?
03just google "[name of game] nds rom"
12Just tell me the site you're looking at
1. Buy a game 2. ROM Dump 3. Profit
But eh
03I use google.
;>
because applepie is the best pie
just as Applejack is the best pony
that is tough to argue
that is also tough to argue
12Google just brings me rom sites which suck
12The two I found gave me crap roms
03not really
03well
03what games?
03because
shy pony is best pony :|
03you might need to update AKAIO for them to run
12Just Art academy
03the ROMs themselves might be perfectly fine
ok
Capitalization and punctuation.
meh
ooh.
03try downloading the newest AKAIO from their site
12both were blank when I tried to run them, just a white screen
12Ok :>
I'm a sucker for a tomboy with freckles I guess
speed and accuracy!
I'm too tired, thus bored/bored, thus tired to care, Dashie
03yeah
03I think the ROMs are fine
03that sounds like a software problem
COG.
articuno do u like bolt?
12It's one of my fav films
03EW MILEY CYRUS
03All I have to say about that
12Like I care about the voices
03I refuse to watch any movie with her in it
If you see Rev, use my name to make a ding for me so I know he's here...
03I totally care about the voices
Lol
Lmao of course drf would say that
12She's not in it, only her voice is
03it's why the new dub of Pokémon sucks
He's so obvious
03because the voices suck
mmk
03therefore, VAs matter
03and they matter a lot
12It ALL sucks
12The whole dub, the script, everything
03not the original voices
03no way
Yes, the new anime sucks :x
or I'll just have DerpyBot send you a message
03but yes
12The original is for 2 year olds lol
03the new anime sucks anyway
Fancy.
but yeah, I will
03Black and White/Best Wishes/wtf it is
03that show sucks horribly
12They all do
12Pokemon the anime is horrendously bad
03LOL
forgive my very long time away from IRC, but how the heck do you use bold-ding someone.. if that sentence made sense
03Thank you, can I have my DVD of Articuno and Lugia episodes back since yo uhate it? :>

12No

03I got to go behind the pit of a NASCAR race today
03:>
12But she's 12
Which Disney?
that makes entirely too much sense
Lucky DRF :(
12No offence but NASCAR means nothing to a Brit LOL
03well
03let me put it this way
03only people who sponsor a car can enter the pit
:o
by the by, and hoping this does not step too far over PG. Crown and Cherry Dr Pepper really is quite good
12Probably lolz
12brb sorry
03BBC is cool
I know :>
03but the only cool stuff on it is Top Gear
BBC world news
Ok thnaks
And top gear, fine :P
BBC-A ftw
03however

Congratulations Cog.

Wait, muffins?
But why waste disk space and bandwidth ;p
no muffins

"cough cough" pony touhou is awesome
alrighty, I will cya y'all later. Getting foods. And apple pie, since I was influenced that way and now it sounds delicious

...so that people don't figure out the mail system and start spamming each other with messages...
wait what Arti
12^v^
12Read up
03it's rare to find a "bad" ROM rip, it's usually just the flash card being outdated
sshhh.. don't give them ideas
mmk, Bye sketch
hehehe
lol
I won't, sketch
bye :)
haha, DerpyBot, mail system, I get it :D
you can only send a limited number of messages at a time

12>v>
oh okay, that's good then
12When I tried to get rid of them before you wouldn't let me >v>
rid of what?
But the big question is
Why is Articuno listening/caring about what Nick says o.o
12*sigh* Nevermind, you didn't read up XD
i guess i still need to add some spam protection nevertheless
12Um Because he's my friend maybe??
so does DerpyBot have any kick/ban capabilities?
like, only 2 muffins per minute
I am but I can't see what it is specifically you're talking about xD
not at the moment..
Yeah Johnsey
Is he the founder of TST? :p
and HML what?
That should make it bette

It's annoying.

And you should feel bad for doing it.
Actually, I have been banned at least once from every chat room I have participated in. sadly...
12No it's "If you're going to kill me."

Nono, it's "If you're going to kill me."

No Tirek, I have no plans to let sister drag her pets out all the way to Everfree castle again, just to get blasted by rainbows, again..... for a third time.

of course, I prefer my popcorn salted, no butter
or with caramel

Yeah, that happened to me once. Never use a rainbow of darkness against a rainbow of light
/me starts making a popcornucopia
now what doesnt sound appetizing, is that stupid SPAM POPCORN, they sell at the hawaiian tourist traps

Not really, impersonating a mane character badly can result in your forever shame and hatred.

shunned forever
Too true, unless you thrive on pain and hatred...

03I already answered that
I got defeated by Sea Ponies, man...
03it's something to stop idiots like you from signing up for stuff
-_-
I got defeated by a flying burrito, no joke, I was just walking one day, and some crazy guy throws a freaking BURRITO out of his car and into my face
Whoops.
that's fricking weird
/me is so tired, he's bored, and is so so bored, he's tired...*
I keep my levels up by battling spiders constantly
did you eat it, twenty?
I ended up on the ground covered in random burrito and I was like: THE HAY?
so the low-level stuff can't take me down so easily
No, could have been poison haha
AH NOEZ
MAH LAPTOP IZ GONNA DIE SOON!
must..find....power source...!
but its not the first time random food has been thrown at me, a while back in SF CHinatown, a passing car threw a CARTON OF SOYMILK at me, and it missed by like an inch and exploded on the ground
hey yu just call me an idiot but im not in idiot
wth?
it must be that guys urban games they are playing...
maybe you have a target painted on you
Ned I think?
haha
ok I spelled it wrong :/
And another time downtown, a random take out box of rice was thrown at me, Im starting to get used to it now...
oh well
03<disney> hey yu just call me an idiot but im not in idiot <- that is like the best quote I've heard in ages
now my feelings are hurt:(
aw, poor disney
Maybe you should get a neutered parasprite for a pet...
twentyprecentcooler maybe your in a game you don't even know of like this ---> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZzvwipf72k
12disney, read this: http://www.howtospell101.com/start-from-the-known
12Then tell me when you're done :3c
how do you neuter a parasprite? D: duct tape its mouth shut?
HAHA
I have the weirdest stuff happen to me all the time though, so Im usually like, ah whatever
I suspect that it's the same way you neuter a tribble.
AND THEN I WAS OFF.
Goodnight! :>
Take care!
lata
