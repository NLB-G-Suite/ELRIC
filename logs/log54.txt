03oh
03on the letters.
03you bet on a letter, if you get it wrong you lose that much, if you get thew ord right you win that much
03and they keep guessing wrong,.
6I'm guessing the answer's obvious?
03to me it was, obviously not to the contestants
03yeah, the girls almost got wiped out of the game
03completely
03never seen that
03XD
03wtf Firefox
03I hit page-up and it opened a new tab o_O
sometimes my touchpad breaks
and runs random searches or opens control panel whenever I try to use it
03OL
03*LOL
that's always fun to deal with.
03this is the keyboard though, not the trackpad
06Gnite all :3
g'nite
6This keyboard is very annoying to me.
6The a-button is broken, and the n-key and spacebar sometimes doesn't work.
03is it a desktop?
6Broken not as in not functioning, just it wiggles off every now and the.
6then*
6No, it's my parents' laptop.
03oh
03as I have like 20 spare keyboards lying around should anyone want one :P
03same with mice.
6As long as you pay for shipping, sure. :>
03yeah, I would
03LOL, these guys are super extactic (sp) about winning $5000
03that's such a crap reward for a game show
03I'm used to things like Millionaire
well if they fail at life as much as they were a few minutes ago
5k would be a lot
03true
extacy is the old spelling
I don't know the new one
because I just use the deprecated one.
03LOL @ this T Vshow title
03"How Big Can It get?"

Minnet: reload your functions
Lakorv: I reloaded funcs.lua.

/me pokes Articuno.

03that's awesokme
03-k
12drf, did you hear about how Virgin Mobile is going to be offering Motorola phones now?
03no, but I ha,ve Verizon
03*have
over here, you can get any phone on any network, with any plan o.O
03and people will pay for it
12I know xD but Virgin Mobile used to never offer phones like that
03that being said you can still buy unlocked phones
6Well.
6I just encountered a very stereotypical example of an uneducated person when it comes to pixel fan art.
07k
07showertiems
/me afkhawk
6Okay to you.
12lol, no offence intended, but most people draw awful pixel art
03that's because pixel art is just pixel art
03o.o
6Shush, DRF.
6Do you want me to make correlations?
12Well, I like pixel art, but some people really don't know what they are doing
pixel art can be amazing
12It takes true skill to draw pixel art
6And patience. X>
02You must tell the story of this uneducated person, I'm really curious
12Well, it takes patience to draw anything good
6For piece of pixel art 100 x 100 requires clicking 10,000 times.
/me sits down with pizza
03or you can just draw a normal picture and downscale it to 100x100
12That would not look right
6That would not be pixel art, DRF. But I digress.
02lmao
6Which I refuted with what art counts as fair use.
02On one of your arts?
02On dA?
6On the sprite I'm working on now.
6On MS Paint. :P
02So how did they see it? .-.
6It's on this laptop and I'm working on it. :U
6In real life.
12However, patience is what separates good fan art from bad fan art.
02Ahh I see
-space
6ovO?
6Oh.
6That space.
12Yep XD
6Anyway, my sprite is a fake Grass/Dragon dinosaur fakemon. Inspired by a person's comment on dA and (I think) AE's comment here.
6Hmm. Its head looks like a banana.
/me 6edits.
02YESZ
02Finally
02A long battle
6Donde?
02With only 5 min remaning
10pop
6ovo
/me sprawls out on Feather
10<3
02You need to draw more art so that I may be jealous
10I've had an art block
10but I think I'm getting past it
ohai Feather
02Awesome
10I actually could draw something yesterday
10XD
02Because I'm starting to go into one lmao
6Feather?
6Draw Suiguno. >v>
/me 6flies
10wanna do an art trade o-o
02lmao
6Hmm...
6Eh, what the heck. :P
10Coooool
6As long as my sprite isn't as detailed as Suiguno IV. Ovo
10XD
10wasn't expecting you to
6Lol.
6Well, how good my sprites are fluctuates.
/me curls up on Feather's head
6I've recently drawn a Zorua and Hydreigon I'm pleased with.
6But it's on notebook paper.
10Hydreigon :D
6Anyway, the art trade:
6Whaddya want?
Hmm?
O.o
Ou
Oh, nvm
/me thinks
/me yawns
/me 6floofs.
/me 6anticipates Nick.
/me slobbers on Feather's head
03LOL @ Judge Judy
03this girl is crying over a guy owing her $70
10...LOL
03I mean, small claims court... but SMALL claims court? XD
6The guy owes her? O_o
03that's why they're in court
03she's suing him for a payment on a computer
03but the payment was only $70 LOL
You could find that on a streetside :p
02What streetside?
02I want to find this streetside
03a rich one?
02These people obviously aren't rich if they're going to court over $70
03I know right
03who needs a loan to buy a laptop
03I mean, like, actual adults
03not kids
6LAG.

07at least it isn't horribly autotuned lol
10oh joy
6It's actually decent.
6Note the like/dislike ratio.
03LOL Judge Judy
03these guys are admitting to smoking pot
03on the show
03If I was a judge
03and someone admitted to breaking a law
03I'd be like GTFo, both of you
07Alright
07lol
07I'm off for foods
07but she isn't a judge
03How is Judge Judy not a judge
07she was
03was?
07but nothing on the show is legally binding
03wait
03really?
07yup
07when someone on there sues someone else
03then why do they say "real cases, real people, the decisions are final" etc
07both sides make money
07lol
07it's arbitration
03hm
03I didn't know that XD
03either way
03she dismisses cases all the time, if someone comes in there and talks about being a drug addict, I'd dismiss it right then and there
07whoever loses just gets less money than the other XD
03where's the money come from o.o
07the tv studio lol
02Makes sense why people who lost still smile even when they get out of court
03people get paid to be on the show?
07yup
03dude, someone sue me please
/me runs
07it's in the credits XD
03hm, I'll pay close attention then
6Feather? That art trade?
10Sorry, I'm trying to think of something XD
10got a lot going on at once
6Okay.
/me draws on Feather's head
6I have 30 minutes.
02My masterpiece
/me draws on Feather's head as well
10Ohhh I know what I want
02Get your own head >|
12XD
6Eh?
10Ness dressed in Scout's outfit :D
6ovO
6As a sprite?
6Hmm...
6So was my precognizance correct?
06<%Feather> Ness dressed in Scout's outfit :D
06Yes.
06It make sense. If Ness is the one with the bat.
6D:
6WHY SHOW THAT? DDDDDDDDDDDDDD:
10THAT PIC IS AWESOME D:
06Surprise
10you totally made me picture spy blonde lol
6Is not. :<
6My mental perception's changed due to Liquidsilk's idea.
6But anyway, drawing cartoonishly...
6I guess I could... X.x
10more than half my gallery I can't even look at anymore lol
10so I know how you feel
10but really
10I love that picture D:
6So you want Ness as relatively normal?
6Not like SSBB?
10YES, I hate SSBB's style XD
6Okay.
6So, wait:
/me 6checks Ness's design.
/me stalks
6How would you tell that was Ness?
6He's not very distinctive. :P
03Wow, I didn't realize that Timmy's dad is voiced by the guy who plays Gordy in Ned's Declassified
03but that's interesting
03and makes sense
6Doesn't he also voice Cosmo?
03I'm not sure
03does he?
03I'm watching that live action movie, it's on Nick right now
10It can be Ness with his normal hat colors, but wearing it the way Scout does, his original backpack, and a black and blue striped shirt (that'll represent team blu). Then he'll just have Scout's original pants, socks, shoes, bandages, dogtag, and earpiece. :D
/me 6notes that.
10oh, and if you wanted to add a bat, Ness's original wooden bat
10XD
06>Normal Hat
6Oookay.
06>TF2
06what are you smoking
/me dies
10wut?
10XD
6I'm not sure if I can live up to your expectations.
06x3
6Now, drawing an entire figure...
10Oh, you don't HAVE to draw his whole body
10was just noting incase you did
6Ah.
6Eh...
6I'll see what I can do.
10I definitely don't want to ask too much from you
10ah, darn... just realized his hat contains red
/me 6will abuse her Ticonderoga pencil and archaic, loose notebook to the best she can.
6Scout's hat?
10Guess I can just go with that
6All right.
10and you want Suiguno?
6Hrm.
6Well, can you draw old-ish people?
6Or two people? :P
10when I do it always ends up cute and young looking lol
10I can do two people
6Eh...
6This idea came up in my mind because of voice actors:
03why the frick are they making a Glee 3D movie >_>
obscure Japanese characters ftw?
Glee 3D O.o
Wat
o_O
They better have Safety Dance in 3d >:(

Glee is decent :p

Stop hatin'

Nou
Well, at least they can sing
yes
Better than you :p
but they cover some of the worst songs ;p
other than journey's song ;p
I don't know that song :p
So it must be a bad song
o.o
well, their covers are terrible
Then you profit :po

03if they were a secret, how could they possibly know?
Hmm, parents
03for all you know she COULD have
12i'm going to get this video upto 100,000 views :D
03this sounds interesting though xD
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3qho_mblKQ

03and they all have different stories
06CLASSIC "WHO IS LYING" TASK GO
03yeah
03I would have laughed if all 3 people said they killed her
03it's like "GOOD LUCK ARRESTING ANY OF US"
03but I haven't heard the stories yet
03still watching
06more like "lol ok arresting all of you until further investigation"
06or well, keep them in custody or whatever it's called
03still, they couldn't definitively charge one person if all 3 claim to have done it
03since this was back in the 80s
03they didn't have hte fancy DNA stuff XD
06xD
06fair enough
03well, could abeen early 90s
06but still, no magic DNA shenanigans
03I think the show went from like 1982 to early 2000s, but this is clearly an older episode given the quality of it
03yeah this is obviusly before GPS
03as two of the 3 witnesses were cops
03and they had no way of veri3fying if they were really there
03all cop cars now have trackable GPS LOL

10:D
7I think I made Ness look older than he's supposed to be. o3o
12Feather~~~~
7But I think that's because of his minute proportions normally.
10That's fine, I'd rather him look older than younger XD
7Okay, well, let me scan the two sketches in.
7Then you can decide if you want which to digitalize.

12that is fast
03that's horrible for a school
03my university had like 60mbps
7The idea that anyone who uses Hitler or the Nazis in an argument automatically loses the argument.
03orly?
7Well, draws comparisons to.
03wha[t about the expression 'grammar nazi'
03or my personal favorite, "copyright nazis"
ah
03because that's more or less what the MAFIAA is
thanks
:P
7Well, that'd put your commentary to no persuasion. :P
There is one instance in which Godwin's Law does not hold. Namely, when actually discussing Hitler and the Nazis. :P
7Actually, the statement above is one of Godwin's Law's corollaries (I just checked).
7I have a feeling this is going on our chat stats vocabulary list. D:

That explosion was just a cover to make you think he dead.
Damn DCD... Now I want to cosplay as Gillian.
so the unicorns are part of madnar's plan to take over the world?
THANKS FOR THE SPOILER DASHITE

Napoleon's not a snatcher. He's just some figment of a tall man's imag- Oh /that/ Napoleon.
all napoleons ever were snatchers

are you complaining elky
Oh yeah, 4some, my point still stands.
9it wouldn't fire
not at all
9but eh
Didn't you say you intentionally missed one on training so it wouldn't go into impossible difficulty?
9doesn't matter now
at least you survived
what's impossible difficulty?
9accidentally hit a civilian
03it's a flash game.
03Kitten Cannon
O SHI SNATCHER
9that makes it "hard, but not impossible"
03I just like referring to it XD
JUST WHAT I WAS THINKING GILLIAN!
but how hard is impossible?
Wait, they hate ultraviolet rays?
Can't ever complete, give up impossible.
9Rubber Band AI: Doing well in the practice gun shooting sections makes the in-game sequences almost impossible. It is recommended to do intentionally poorly to keep the difficulty down. And even then, if you're running the game on an emulator (and, let's face it, in this day and age, you probably are), you'll either have to be a keyboard magician or, if you'r

It goes good, but my last name isn't white

Gillian hits on anything that moves, he's shown surprising restraint with Metal Gear though...

Metal Gear doesn't move fast enough to bother
metal gear doesn't put out

Practice our skills before the big game.

Or possibly building up to a Snatcher-related twist
4@PizzaPony: I still have my copy of MGS for the PS1
I was wondering if he was a snatcher...
8http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/6271771/images/1255557317139.png
GHOSTIES
WAIT I WASNT SERIOUS
@Ghosties: Wait, you mean it's possible to NOT still have it?
4What, Dermathil?
I always thought MGS was an FPS so I never touched the series
4@PizzaPony: Yes, it's possible. I know, it seems unfathomable
MGS is a stealth-espionage game
3rd person, with the ability to do 1st person scoping
ohai
Not the first one
Take the poster.
4Hah, hi Dermathil
true, the 1st person wasnt in #1 except for the psg1 and stinger, unless you count the twin snakes
Did you change color Ghosties?
what i miss
4Twin Snakes was good, but not nearly as great as the original MSG
I don't remember you being so... red
did you kill the chief
and yeah i hate twin snakes
snake goes all neo
It's possible to have never played MGS let alone not own it.
4And no, I didn't change color, Dermathil XD
psg1 stinger and twin snakes? ...Weapons?
there is just something about snakes polygon head in mgs
ah
huh...
4Bah, MSG
and he shouldn't be there
4MGS
so he's nowhere?
PSG1 and Stinger are weaons, Twin Snakes is a remake for the gamecube of MGS
9Mobile Suit Gundam?
metal gear solid
OH FUCK BLOOD
BLOOOOOD
4Twin Snakes was a much more action oriented version of MGS; much flashier, too
THE ROOOOOOF
6How are you? :P
oshit
Should I just go tackle the first one?
WAT
O SHI
The fuck?
OH SNAP
SPIDERMAN IS A SNATCHER
4The fuck was Kano doing up there...?
IN EVERY CONTINUITY OF HIS SERIES
No one ever looks on the roof!
Ghosties: he's a terminator crossover in Blade Runner
See? We play as Harrison Ford!
Find blood. Red stains on red background!
dat blood
Wigglesworth is a snatcher.
Use the UV light! Find out that other people hit on other people too... much more successfully
4@Dermathil: Well, Boon did say that Kano's eye was directly influenced by the Terminator in a scene from T2
wasn't there blood under the chair in the detective's room?
good
hehehe
yourself?
or at least I saw some there
4Confession time!
Has anyone seen DSNesmith
The devs of this said they blatantly ripped off Terminator and Blade Runner when they made this
I love confession time!
4I have no idea what is going on in this game.
Inspiration, Dermathil. Inspiration.
Confession? Ghosties is gonna confess to being a snatcher?
there!
THAT'S WHAT A SNATCHER WOULD SAY
Ghosties is a SNATCHER.

4I have an idea for another live LP
I like them apples as much as Applejack likes hers.
DAT VOICE OVER
4If the mods will here it
i.e. a lot
this game was pretty awesome
/me activates the thrusters on his rocket lawnchair. CYALL, GOTTA GET SOME SLEEP ON DA MOON!!!!!
9oh yes, did I mention that Snatcher: Episode 2 is a possibility?
Cya.

OOOH

DCD
Oh, you HAD to remind me, Elky
bye derma
I'M LIKING THIS IDEA
dammit, WHERE'S MY TRIXIE
Everything about this game was perfect. Except the baby unicorn.
Talk about a Missed Moment of Awesome
byebye derma
DCD: why not?
>MFW NO BABY UNICORN PONY
This game is great, it'd be perfect with a baby unicorn though.
baby unicorn PONY
would probably be good too
Hyperbola time (if I can concentrate).
otherwise it'd just be really really really good
9this was spotted during E3 this year. People have chalked it up to the "Sdatcher", but I doubt it will be just that...after all, look at the poster http://gonintendo.com/wp-content/photos/snat2.jpg

03it has TWO rap verses instead of one

03but I want to make a longish edit with all the words XD
No rap is good at all ;pp

12a song has to be FLAC or higher
10Eminem is good

hes fine
03not to mention
I hate rap
03this song isn't a rap song at all
can't stand it in the least
03it's a remake of a classic rock song
03it just has a rap verse
03and heck
03a lot of 80s dance songs have rap verses
03it makes them good XD
03like Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now), etc
Black and White had a rap verse? or something
EWW RAP

9I'll just leave this here
it was better in the late 1990s
03but like I said
03a lot of those songs had rap verses
03rap verses in songs != rap songs
03sigh
03I hate impossible to find songs x.x
If you hate them, why are you looking for them? Trololo.
03LOL
03I mean I hate the fact that they're impossible to find.
03that being said I enjoy a challenge, I've found about four "non existant" songs now
12XD
12I.O.N is impossible to find
12i know what he means
03well
03there was one song
03that my friend heard on the radio back in like 1995
03but only radio stations had it
03and there was no record at all that it even existed
03we finally found it on a UK single I imported, using ebay LOL
03they called it the "Alternate radio edit"
03as the "radio edit" was still the original
03and that song is actally good, it's by Blessid Union of Souls, the people who did that song Brother my Brother for the first Pokémon movie
02Uploaded
Lol.
03the normal one has a n-word in it, the radio edit doesn't, but that one never really surfaced anywhere
12sigh
12i want to get used to keyboard and mouse for TF2
12instead of 360 controller but it just feels so bizaree
12*bizarre
03I hate using keyboard and mouse for games
03hence why I play on the xbox
12you do know TF2 can be adjusted to use a controller right?
except drf hates TF2
I use a wireless PS2- ripoff controller XD
It's the best thing
12i use a 360 controller by default
12but it gets reallly awkward to control the engineer and spy then
02LOL what drf doesn't hate? ... Trains?
Hmm, I think keyboard and mouse are nice to play with. Doesn't make much difference though.

LOL
12dunno if it's all over the place there
12but here it's literally like every 2 blocks
theres 2 Kwik trips here
12ahh

12north of la crosse
12heh
12let me tell you though
12you never seem to understand how great a kwik trip is until you leave the state and have to deal with other gas stations
12rocky rococo is the same case

12that's what i was saying
12it's usually always great

Minnet: reload your hooks
Staeld: I reloaded hooks.lua.
Minnet: load the hook called "dump"
Staeld: Okay, I added the hook.
06Minnet: how are you this evening?
she doesn't like your formulation :P
How are you, Minnet?
Eh, I'm alright, Staeld.
06no-one does
06xD
I should probably ease her up some on what she accepts.
Minnet: reload your hooks
Staeld: I reloaded hooks.lua.
Minnet: load dump
Staeld: Okay, I added the hook.
hm.
06Minnet: take a dump
/me runs
hm..
Lightlugia?
06yes?
06whoops, brb
06ice cream >:D
thanks
I was just looking to make you reply.
I was examining the raw message dumps Minnet wrote.
I'm trying to figure out how to work around the colours.
06ah, i see
06and back :3
but it seems they're specified by use of some control character I can't quite catch.
Minnet: how are you?
Excuse me?
Minnet: hug?
Excuse me?
your colour is 06, but there should be a control character in front of that which tells clients the number means a colour.
also
you need to put her name behind the question if it's not a command.
g'morrow, Minnet
Good evening, Staeld.
she should recognise some slang/dialect as well as proper wordings.
it's not exactly beautiful coding, but it works somehow
Minnet: errow, Minnet
Excuse me?
skip the first mention :p
errow, Minnet
I didn't know that wording though. Should I add it? :p
06yup :3
Minnet: unload dump
Excuse me?
hm
I should make an 'unload' command.
06mmhmm
The character used to signify colour?
I get that as $chr(3) in mIRC.
Minnet: reload hacks
..nice.
gah.
why was that a fatal error
whoever wrote this library should improve it.
okay, so I've made an initial draught for the colour filtering
also I'll add 'herrow' :p
06og, good :3
okay, now to add the colour
err
greeting
gah.
Minnet: reload your hooks
Staeld: I reloaded hooks.lua.
Minnet: load the hook called "greet"
Staeld: Okay, I added the hook.
'errow, Minnet
'Ello, Staeld.
there ya go.
heya, Minnet
Hey, Lightlugia.
06:3
you don't need to skip colours for greetings and such
only for commands.
however
I've tried skipping the colours
give it a try?
06heya, Minnit
6Hmm...
06heya Shadow
6Hey, light.

6Well, where are they conversing? IRL or on the internet?

6Ah.
6Eh, I'd rather not bother her.
6But...
6One moment:
6Well, Staeld; might you get Arti on IRC for a moment?

02Y'know the double meme? I wrote on the death notebook "People who believe they are an animal(or made up creature)."
02And she comments on Manly's upload saying he(technically me) doesn't understand them
6ovO
02So Manly told her to confront with me, which she didn't do. So I did. Thus...fun
02And yes Arti
02!check Lugia.us
It's not just you! http://Lugia.us looks down from here.
02And I just got her to confess that she was pretending to be a Reshiram the whole time(not like it surprises anyone, but hey I got her to say it herself)

We should have had Jaws as A, and Jaws 4 as B. XD

Everyone get on Skype. See who can sing the Jaws theme without laughing the longest. :p
Everyone's already on Skype.

Okay, lmfao. I'm so down for that.
But... I'm trying to get a tournament match done for Brawl. xD
02Oh, lawl
I'm just waiting for my opponent to host a room.
02It won't happen
02Don't worry Ray
02well, I have 13 hours, xD
Way to strengthen my luck, Shiny. lol
02That's what I'm here for
I've beaten this guy before numerous times, so it shouldn't take too long.
Until he hosts, of course. . -.
02._.
02why don't you host?
Cause I told him to host once he's ready.
And I don't want other people joining my room. lol
02lol
02And I have no idea where my remote is
I lost the remote for my ____________ TV
_____________ = drf's least favorite company
You're so messed up, Shiny. <3
Yes she is
02<3
02You want to see it, I know HML
6Hmm.
6Hrm...
02Humdeedum
It's so one-sided. lol
6Is this on your livestream chat?
03Playing with dangerous chemicals is both fun and completely annoying
03my finger fricking hurts now since I got acid all over it >_>
capsaicin burns.
they are fun.
03LOL
03we were using uh
03sulfuric acid
02No, it's on Manly's doublememe. He uploaded it to his profile and she commented there
03dangerous stuff
6Ah.
03that and sodium hydroxide (strong base)
lol
6What's she saying now?
sounds like a recipe for
fun
!!
03XD
02She took the whole meme seriously
03Yeah but my lab partner was a complete idiot
What meme?
I don't think capsaicin is actually dangerous
03I was about ready to murder him by the time class was done
but that doesn't stop it from hurting like a mofo.
oo
02Manly and my double meme we did together
Link?
6Literally...
I couldn't play Oblivion for an entire weekend because my fingers wouldn't stop burning.
it sucked.
6I saw the meme on your page.
02Yeah?
basically I was just slicing peppers for chili.
6Oooh.
Are they Red Hot?
03and capsaicin is what now?
I had done this many times in the past but with no repercussions
/me runs for Red Hot Chili Peppers
it's the chemical that makes things spicy.
You did not just link that, Shiny. XD
03ah
03speaking of spicy
02I did so just link that
agreed, SL
03you know that sour sugar stuff?
I love spicy chili so I saw no problem with this
03for some reason if I eat too many sour candies my tongue getls compoletely burned from it
03-l
6Are you talking about citric acid?
6@DRF.
03is that what it's called?
but I failed to realize that while handling the peppers, you're supposed to wear gloves.
03it's the stuff that sour candies like Sour Skittles are coated in
6Sounds like it from your definition.
03OK
03yeah, it totally burns
03like literally
I hate that stuff too lol :\
03for several days
03if you eat too much
if I disconnect soon, brb xD
I don't really eat sour candies anymore because of it.
03same
03sometimes I'll wipe the sugar off
03I just kinda don't get why they COAT the candy in that stuff
03maybe like 1/3 that amount would be enough XD
or just regular skittles
'cause they're superior anyway
:d
03true
03I like Sour Patch Kids though
sour patch kids are aight
Some things make your tongue bleed if you eat too many of them.
Like toxic waste sweets.
03but some of those have waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much citric acid on them
but just like anything, the overuse of the sugar can kills 'em lol
03I still call it "sour sugar", regardless what the actual name is
03yeah
03heck
03I used to eat those candies in school, right
03and my teachers would get mad that I'd spill the sugar all over the place
03I'm like "it's not my fault there's half a pound of it loose in the bag..."
6Hmm, Shiny?
02Hmm what?
I'd just eat Swedish Fish 'cause lol no random crap in it
03YAY SWEDISH FISH
03that's like my favorite candy ever
:D
02What's it matter? She won't take my advice anyways lmao
03but for a while my school ran out of swedish fish
6I guess...
03so I resorted to sour patch kids XD
XD
poor danny :(
02But do you care to explain?
03because I used to be addicted to eating two bags of candy a day
03in my physics class
I gave her some advice, and she seems to be a bit better
03yay unhealthy?
well, you know what they say
everything in moderation
03yeah
including moderation itself.
/me 6just realized that Shiny's question was at her.
03but I have a feeling 2 bags of candy a day is a bit more than they meant :P
/me 6gets a response:
moderation's meaningless if you don't ignore it once in a while :P
03LOL
03inb4 +h
/me hides
ic wut u did thar
03haha @ how Judge Judy just pronounced "shihtzhu" or whatever it is
03I actually thought she swore for a second.
No, she shouldn't
oo
03god, these cases make me sick to the stomach
03when someone sues someone else for hurting their pets
02She doesn't already?
03EW ANIMAL ABUSE
02I mean, not in a joking kind of sense, but she doesn't take that seriously
6But now she'll have an excuse not to.
6That is, if she follows that.
I have so many windows open right now rofl
02And I believe I worded it to saying she shouldn't take things that are for laughs too seriously
02She cannot give the excuse I told her so if she misread it
I talked with her and figured a few things out, and I also tried to talk to her about whatever issue she had, so I was hoping that might've solved something
6Assuming she follows that logic.
6Recent notice.
because she's gett
that
03recent notice?
6I'm mildly curious that she hadn't responded to that Lugiram sprite.
02You were too busy to notice me talking about it drf
lol
:P
03LOL

Grand Canyon is nice.

I have my old computer's 80GB hard drive that I use as a hand mirror.
it's probably demagnetised by now anyway.
I have the rest of the pieces in a box by my closet.
and it's still operating. It's what holds my OS, infact.
lol, I remember when I got a game on a floppy disk from KFC in 2003
Oo 80 and 40 GB hard disks
lol
And whut
My computers only have one hard drive each, and I don't think they can support more.
prebuilt by manufacturers, etc
I have a spacy desktop tower.
loads of space for drives and air.
laptop is just a single hdd though.
I wanna build a desktop one day. With fancy things.
Till then I have two laptops and no cash. lol
that said, my desktop is self-built and old.
it's got an Opteron 185 and a GeForce 7300 LE.. say no more.
lolol
My hardware isn't too fancy either, 'specially my hard drive(s)
amazing how those little thin disks were used less than 10 years ago
150GB
It gets full on a regular basis these days.
I've a 250 and a 40 GB drive in the desktop.
I keep most of my crap on externals now.

03but if you have Windows, and you have a password on it, just boot up a live boot ubuntu and steal all the files./
that's the point, silly
that's why you encrypt
03not to mention, you can just wipe the data and have a nice shiny new laptop.
Too bad US border securty breaks your whole encruption thing by doing their utmost to make your life hell until you let them snoop around your laptop. :P
so you /can't/ steal the files
because you need the password to decrypt them.
03I prefer to just not have anything of value on there.
not the os, but the files.
and this is my school laptop, things /will/ be on it.
I keep most things of value on my externals.
external(s)
03oh no somebody found a paper you wrote
03what ever will you do
/me hides
02Did someone call or was saying something was shiny?
LOL Shiny new laptop xD
02I figured when I saw talk about laptops
somebody said that
03XD
03still, I just keep my laptop in my sight at all times so having a password on it is stupid.
03besides when it's at my house, at least
encryption adds on to passwords though.
encryption for file security
03well
/me decides if he wants to add to the debate or not
03it's more of a hassle
passwords for os access.
03I prefer just hitting power and having access to my computer.
03rather than having to type in a password which is completely stupid anyway
03at least on Windowsa
03-a
03because you can easily just delete the password
/me yaaawns
yeah, but.. I run Linux and password != encryption.
03LOL Linux on laptos
03*laptops
03but yeah
Join the Shiny's room, Ray. lol
02lol
lol hating on linux
Eesh, linux on a laptop is pure hell.
03I have my laptop set to completely unencrypted, no password, turn it on and it logs in type thing
03I don't have anything against Linux
03I can see using it on a desktop but...
Linux on this laptop works just as well as Windows.
actually it works better.
02Manly I have 3 free slots
later peeps
02What should I do with them?
02xD
I get longer battery time, working hotkeys and such things.
Example of Linux on laptop WTF??? moments: "WHY in the name of Jesus, did my Intel wi-fi card not work with Intel drivers, BUT WORKS WITH WII DRIVERS!?"
03LOL
03that and it somehow heating wup more than it should
03-w
Three slots for what, Ray? lol
Also, someone Linux seems my display as 640x480 maximum size.
[1,0You0,4Tube]: cnn - intel "programmable matter" | by sdrtth | Length: | Views: 1 587
Windows goes up to 1620x1200
brb
023 Armor Slots xD
thing about Linux is, either you know what you do or you take the blame.
And Linux with the correct drivers for the card still doesn't want to go past 640x480.
...FreeBSD and OpenSolaris on the other hand...
read my line again; must be a weird thing if it heats based on os.
Well, to put it lightly, Debian made me want to sledgehammer the laptop. FBSD and OSOL work magnificantly. (Also, they have less "04HATE" moments.)
02Wheee
Except for OSOL, that just doesn't like my wi-fi. :/
02Shiny (intended nickalert) I love this Derpternetz xD
02I do too
02hi?
Also, Linux on my desktop... "I CANNOT SEE ETHERNET CARDS? DOWNLOAD DRIVERS PLZ?"
That might be a problem with a monster like the Jhen.
02yeep It'll
"Okay Linux, please go dial the modem." "MODEM NO EXIST."
"I hate you Linux, I really, really do."

This is CGI

6You need to add FlutterPeanut to the exceptions.
Oh yeah,
I knew I was going to forget someone.
11alright, so I see that those we've accepted for modding are Rainbro (duh) and Sathi. What. Of. the others? The only reason their applications are in the mail account is because I don't know if they're yay or nay.
>implying peanut shows up anyway
6I had to count them all.
much closer from gameplay-looking CGI.
6We're waiting for this week to give Soarin a trial run.

I run Crysis 2 on highest settings. Maybe it could run Crysis 1, I don't have it.
im not sure hes going to be committed
ALSO, NO AUTOSAVE system. Always manual save.
6As am I.
Crysis 1 is much more graphics intensive than Crysis 2.
I know.
6I do want to see how he'll do and decide then though.
Crysis 2 is a console port.
That's why I said maybe it could run C1, but I don't have it.
I KNOW
!pokemon
I just have generations 1 and 2 on
so I recognize all of these
8so pixel-y
The consoles use 2006 hardware, so it is obvious it isn't going to look as pretty as a pc-only title that melted every computer back in 2007
11Did we interview isoscoles?
man, I remember this game...I should really finish it sometime
11...I shouldn't say "we", I haven't been here. XD
6!pokemon
ohai :3
02!pokemon
Oh, there's soarin.
fuckyeah stalker streams
6nooooooo
howdy
!pokemon
11Allo, Soarin.
Hey Soarin.
!pokemon
):
!pokemon
x_x
I never even got past the blockade beneath the train. Why? This game gave me motion sickness...
02!pokemon
02Heckyes
Hey Soarin'
!pokemon
Woo.
!pokemon
6epic
Dodrio is one of my favorites. <3
11...motion sickness?
yeah
6Yeah, he said he'd be here for this today.
!pokemon
it shaked too much right and left
when running
It defies the laws of physics when it flies.
the fire canines are floofier though.
11Pistols are easiest used with the stupid crosshairs rather than the manual aim.
yeah, the aiming is also abysmally bad
11Did we interview isoscoles?
!pokemon
6I honestly don't know.
playing with mods or vanilla?
6I was late to a few of the interviews.
I don't think it is with mods
wow, the video quality is really bad
11...um....why is DashAttack's mail get sent to the spam folder? XD
What is this?
aw, okey dokey
6I don't believe that we did interview isoscoles.
07!pokemon
07z.z
it's STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl
/me wanders.
no clue, silver
I wish I could play Metro:2033 on my machine.
actually, the graphics-quality of this game makes me think of Oblivion.
;o
metro was pretty good
!pokemon
11I'm sending them a reply email.
a linear stalker basically
Ohai Elky.
hey
I'm sure Metro is better than Stalker. Never got to play it though.
hi Elky
Even with a brand new card, the games still lags too much for it to be playable.
Hey Elky
not bad
suddenly, ads
6Who?
but not exactly one of my favorites
7Feather, do you mind if I straighten out the edges of Scout-Ness's armholes?
6I just sent DashAttack one.
!pokemon
07Well, heading off.
BTW nittany, storm's ended
gotta turn adblock back on
yes, already
10I don't mind o-o
hey Aponymous.
Quick single-cell event, or you were just on the edge of one.
11I just sent Dash Attack one as well....
11....
07Seeya :>
11BWAHAHAHAHAHA!
Hey _Dermathil
7Okay.
6XD
11Anyway, I'll send out the Thursday update email tomorrow, that is, if my shitty dial-up will allow me to.
11I forgot to send the Monday one.
11Also, Hipster, if you don't mind, could you tell Sethisto of our email account and start using it to contact him for BMN?
not on the edge that I can assure you.
They basically form on top of our heads everyday for about ten minutes
gtg, goodnight! =D
sure
when did you start?
If only Environment Canada posted their radar feeds online.
8about 10 minutes ago, elky
He started at about 18:45
11Thanks. I'll do the same for ARGH.
okay then, any important exposition?
11Also, do we know what the status is on Fighting is Magic?
it's pretty much the first fight you get into
oh
you in the zone
xD
WHAAAAA?
6Haven't herd anything from them.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
kill strelok
IMPOSSIBRU
no changes that im aware of
/me 11nods, "they must still be developing then."
11We can wait another month, then we should ask for an update so that we know when to start helping them out.
http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/ctp/ <- would you rather have heat warnings or t-storms?
Fucking heat.
7http://img696.imageshack.us/img696/2563/scoutnesspixel2.png <-- Edited some details.
11sorry if I'm being pushy, it's just I'm short on time with this comp and Im trying to get as much done as I can. XD
what kind of heat are we talking about here?
I'd rather have a nice, cold winter
6Guys, I'm going to email DesSur about the advert on his show. Cool with everypony?
I get thunderstorms and COLD winters.
/me 7mirror-flips the image and continues edits.
11One of my workers got heat stroke today.
11my mom's workers*
I'd prefer cold weather too.
-30degrees celcius
11advert?
in winter
11That's The Brony Show, right?
6He does little 10 second adverts during his show.
+30degrees celsius in summer
6No.
about what we get too
11???
although it's more cold generally
11I've been out for two weeks, so I'm a bit slow on the upkeep.
Not hot desert weather. Just hot and humid weather.
Eh
11o.o
6He came to us.
11OH! I know now.
6It has only a few followers.
11wait, what? o.O
11no shit.
This winter was really cold. First time I ever experience negative Fahrenheit temps. (I haven't lived in PA all of my life).
NIttany: The thunderstorms form around 6PM because of the heat and humidity that prevents the clouds from forming or something.
6?
You mean a capping inversion?
11Another stream came to us. That's awesome.
6Eyup.
What's that?
6Also The Brony Show does wish to partner with us at some point, but that'll be down the line.
This kinda reminds me of Fallout, except with Russians.
It's when air temps rise with height.
6And will need to be worked out then, obviously.
Maybe its that, I dunno
6But they have been plugging us consistently.
11Really? Awesome.
Usually, temps do the opposite with height.
what did they have in mind?
It's probably what's happening.
STRANGE, I remember looting multiple shotguns from that first fight.
11We should save a full out partnership with them until after the Fighting is Magic thing, though.
shotties and SMGs
Bulletproof dogs? Why haven't I played this?
they are pretty shitty anyway
as long as you aren't at point blank range they don't hit anything
If you go from no clouds to "Suddenly, thunderclouds.", you've had a cap break.
Maybe that's what it is then
11When that hits, our popularity will be through the roof. Making a partnership then would guarentee both parties an increase in people interested.
Woo Stalker!
BTW DCD, did you know about the suit in the roof?
hi dashite
Sadly, this is as far as I've ever gotten. I need to go back to this.
/me 11is in full business mode right now, with only 7 mins left on the library comp. XD
(Yeah I read the hints and tricks before starting to play. Didn't serve me anything
6They don't really have much in mind, just that they would like to partner. I haven't really talked much business with them.
Dashite: same. Well, Never went further than the spot where you gotta pay some dudes to pass under a bridge with a train on.
11Did we ever actually advertise our steam group on here?
what I don't understand are the anomalies that don't hurt NPCs
It took me 3 or so attempts to actually finish the game
6Yes.
because it's so flawed
6Briefly.
6We have a lot of followers on it.
but with mods I endured it
6Plus there's a link to it on the bottom of the site, so... *shrug*
and NPCs do die to anomalies
lol, I remember when I first saw an anomalie kill a dog, I thought it was some kind of freaky invisible alien
mind linking me to a mod that fixes the FRICKING AIMING PROBLEM? Oh, and one that permits autosaving every five minutes?
11I have five minutes.
11:|
I used some modpack
which fixed and improved a LOT
11and my little cousin is bugging me to take her back. :|
that fixed the shitty aiming?
and added new stuff
LINK PLEASEE!!!
I don't know
the aiming is always shitty as far as I remember
the aiming can't be fixed?
so I'm not sure which part of shitty aiming you mean :p
6Okay... we decided August 26-28 for the LotR thing, yes?
the aiming down sight that's as imprecise as hipfiring
I think it was this: http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-complete-2009
11That's in the middle of the week, though.
6Is it?
11I wouldn't make it to any of it unless we started after 5
6It's the weekend.
11...
11I'm on July. x.x
6XD
oh, the inaccurate aiming is probably just bad weapons at the beginning
it gets better
11Yeah, that weekend would work. XD
6Yeah, we decided one movie, followed by two eps each night.
6That way we still have a reason for the lotto the previous week.
6A total of 6 picked eps.
11I'll make sure not to schedule anything then.
11Sounds good to me.
I meant the aiming that was mentioned in the reviews and such
11I gotta go now. Library time's expired.
6Alright. Later.
DCD, do you know about the suit in the roof in the building behind Wolf?
6Good to get you caught up.
meh, I don't know, don't read reviews
see ya silver
11The mail account's been tidied up and I have the Thrusday update saved on my laptop to send so long as my internet at home holds up.
11See you all later.
BTW soarin' I'm so downloading that mod you linked. It looks GORGEOUS, and maybe could prevent me from getting motion sick again.
11*aparates*
It's a fantastic mod.
6*has been slacking off on the email account*
6*has been busy with the actual site*
(That last thing could've been caused by the alcohol's effects ingame though)
mhm, it's the only thing that made me play it again
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
The backdrop of pinkie's thing during Party Of one could've been a picasso in comparison to the mess that was my screen due to the blur
who?
That guys gonna cut his finger if he keeps doing that.
I never went beyond that checkpoint under the trainbridge
the "dungeons" are really good
basically everything that is underground
I hope, since I'm gonna try that thing again with that mod.
I also got Call of Pripyat but I never even started it up, since I wanted to finish SoC before.
9I hear one should play Vanilla first
9and mods later
nah
9I also hear Complete 2009 makes the game easier
it doesn't matter really
I couldn't bear vanilla
same, I can't even bear the game.
Normally I'd agree with you, but I think the Stalker complete mods are an exception to the general rule.
yup
DCD, follow the edge of the roof
they fix a lot of the stuff that's just bad in the game
you gotta get on top of this building's roof I think.
Hello
Then jump on the next building's roof
that one
yes
inb4 slomo
save maybe?
ouch
The dudes are laughing at you.
"Heh! Look at that idiot! He fell off the roof again!"
10I hate mirror flipping my pictures, they always look horrible when I do LOL
there we go
well, they're not laughing now...
there should be a hole in the roof somewhere with a chest in it
Save the game so you don't have to keep trying. End up doing it like a baws.
one of the corners I think
hi
look in that hole in the roof's corner?
there?
you gotta use a knife on the box
(unless I'm mistaken and all of that is for nothing)
how's it going?
alright
7Well, too late, Feather. :3
7I made my adjustments.
7Uploading again for your approval before I color. :
7:P*
we just beat that demon girl in ToS
10okay XD
THERE IT IS
Fuck the police indeed.
Oh nice, does it feel good to hjave that out of the way?
What's all this for?
but how do you grab it?
!pokemon
yeah
a suit
fun?
7http://img824.imageshack.us/img824/2563/scoutnesspixel2.png
Oh.
God damnit DCD.
he already grabbed it
she was one of the most annoying bosses on our first playthrough
wow
we died the first time when it was just me and Jenna
then we prepared more
the water Pokemon that can use bullet seed
now sell it to see Dermathil's reaction :P
I won't care, its alot of money
were you able to beat her the same way we did?
But it got better stats than the suit he had before
MAYYYYYYYYYYYYBE
just comboing her to no end while COllette spams angel feathers?
No, he just thinks that you are are crazy.
7Jellicent can learn Energy Ball. :P
and Evan joined us
Yeah
Well hello there...
!pokemon
wtf is that
Okay, then throw it on the ground and jump around while singing cupcakes
Jellicent
/me thumbs up :3
whatcha think of the Merc Suit Soarin?
is it a good item?
neat for the beginning
but it won't help for too long
yeah, It is something I found in a hints and trick section somewhere. Still surprised I remember it after a year
7Jellicent is a jellyfish. :P
7And thank you, Feather.
no
SMG all the way
nah
Soarin said no
don't waste your money
be a 1337 agent with awesome pistols
you get weapons everywhere on the road
Soarin is the person to listen.
TENTACOOL RIP OFF
yeah and when you don't have the ammo it's pretty useless
!pokemon
I remember having found a special pistol too at one point.
Soarin has a point, a rule of shooters is that you'll always find more weapons
02!pokemon
roleplaying all the way, anything automatic is useless
02<3
and a rule of RPGs is anything you buy WILL be found 10 seconds later
SMGs aren't pretty good anyway in stalker
!pokemon
ToS?
you want something as accurate as possible
what about shotguns soarin?
And then female.
so you don't have to waste a million ammo
Tales of Symphonia
Oh.
I never used shotguns
great game
!pokemon
a hidden gem
PC or console game?
console
!pokemon
6you devolved
it's for the gamecube and PS2, but I think only the gamecube version got ported outside Japan
nope
I became a water Pokemon
basically once you meet the military guys you don't need to worry about ammo/weapons for a while
Hmm.
yeah maybe
6blasphemy
but more weapons = more weight
I also remember having shot at the militaries at the beginning to lead them to the starting point
1. Go to http://lockfale.com/
ah
2. Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, ba
3. ????
the konami code thing
4. Profit
XD
I've done this before
it's pretty cool
vodka helps you agaist radiation?
Vodka? What's that do?
8>vodka makes you immune to radiation
gets you drunk
ba? O_o -b* XD
lowers radiation
xD
if i remember right
8AWWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHH
yeah, i remembered getting motion sickness because I had too much radiation and drank enough vodka to turn it back to zero
Are you shitting me.
Note to self: Buy more vodka
more like you don't care about the radiation anymore
Ohai Ghosties.
I am not Razyn.
Yes, I am shitting you
it's stalker logic at it's finest
ohai ghosties
Hey Ghosties
heya ghosties
8o hai ghosties
Ghosties, OHAI
8hows your sex life?
!pokemon
it's the same reason that cigarettes increase your EVE in Bioshock :P
I am not _DErmathil
4Hello everyone, sorry I'm late I had to help my mom with her acting class
6OH GOD
I remember never even reaching that farm.
6I want
6!pokemon
why?
6....lol
Never got through that cordon
it just so happens I LIKE water Pokemon
4What is our resident streamer streaming this night?
SR turned up in the movie night stream channel when there were over 200 people.
STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl
I think he was wondering WTH was going on.
STALKER
6it just so happens, I adore espeons
XD the brony one?
6D:
4Looks interesting
Yeah.
DAMN YOU!
SO NINJA'D YOU DASHITE
4Is it on Steam?
vodka games
Yes
it is indeed
yeah
maybe he IS a brony after all!
so we're in chernobyl right now?
I TYPED THE WHOLE NAME
:O
yup
Elky: Chernobyl is way north
I switched it over to this network at least temporarily because of all the netsplits on the one we were on.
!pokemon
I wasn't paying attention. :/
Ghosties: yeah. It is on steam.
But looks horrible
DCD: Confirming shit like a boss.
well it's chernobyl surrounding
So it's more likely because it was 20 times bigger than any other channel. XD
called the zone
don't bash what I like and I will not bash what you like
sound fair?
^^
helicopter? wut?
and the protagonist can't get out?
nope
Haha
the protagonist doesn't want to get out
sorry, I just like to know the story behind a game...
military quarantined the whole area
6..
/me lol'd
6I wasn't bashing, what the heck are you on about
because you can earn lots of russianmoney with artifacts
so he's driven by greed
artifacts
you said me getting a water Pokemon was "blasphemy"
there were 200 people in a channel on this network?
WUT
o.o
6um
6ok....I guess I wont joke around with you then
Yeah.
6I've never known anyone to take the word "blasphemy" seriously
I heard of that... I think. But where?
6which...i guess is ironic
6anyways
6sorry, I didn't think you'd take that seriously
!pokemon
WUT
6I was saying blasphemy about you changing from chikorita to squirtle
TUW
oh
and then the stream was killing floor
let's watch DCD browse ponychan for four hours
I be feeling like testing that mod I downloaded thanks to Soarin'
Am I a bad person for wanting to friend DCD just to spam the video with steam messages?
6yeah
lots of shortcut icons
I think I heard of it because of ponies...
lol
yes
go for it, derma :p
Yes, a very bad person. :P
HOLY SHIT 30minutes of DLing left for that mod
wow
Someone needs to clean up their desktop.
implying anyone uses their desktops
Be a CREDIT TO TEAM and play TF2!
9I am the lazy
There are 17 people still around, watching someone stream killing floor or something.
TF2!!!!
I WANNA SNIPE SOME MOAR
17 is still a lot for this network though
I don't use my desktop at all. Desktop has no icons.
XD
lol, I've actually been considering going back to TF2
it's more than #epic-chat
9'cept I suck at TF2
!pokemon
though I'll have to learn all of the rediculous items they made
/me fires rocket lawnchair at ground below. He then sits in the chair.
So it's still the biggest channel.
CRY SUM MOAR!
Lol. XD
9at least in Floor of Killing I am somewhat decent
haha, but then we can laugh at you!
I don't have KF
this network is kind of pathetically tiny, isn't it?
XD
9I'm not "so bad it's good"
I haven't gotten a single item in TF2 for a while
I just have regular stuff on my desktop, but I nver look at it outside of folder view
Me neither. :(
9I'm "so bad it's horrible"
02!pokemon
awww
Yeah, I suppose.
we still <3 despite being a noob :P
I hadn't realised until recently.
*rocket lawnchair
Fits perfectly, imo.
When I /list and see there's something like 20 different people on the network.
!pokemon
6banettes are cool lol
Auroaraaaaa. I got all this stuff to make my first plush, and I had decided on Kirby. So I went to get fabric and stuffing, and buying enough would've made me broke!
6but their pokedex entry is trippy
4For those curious, yes, that was me. I will be joining DCD in a session of Killing Floor
6luna, what fabric were you going at?
9KILLING FLOOR
9Y U NO BOOT
Some stuff from Wal-Mart
never actually seen KF, so this should be interesting :P
me neither
Same here
the stream is getting experimental...
02If you want a trippy Pokedex
!pokemon
02Look at Darumaka's
I played it during a free weekend once.
Mine won't tell me that
6lol walmart suckls for one thing
evil clown!
02Oh wait no that's for laughs
Clown.
6shiny, yamask, end of story
Killing Floor is pretty neat
It only lists all the channels and how many people are in them
OH GOD A CLOWN!
so is it a story driven game?
Nope.
especially if you play it with bros
no
not when you can get stuff that would be hideously expensive elsewhere fairly cheap
brb
that zombie fails as sword eating
it's a DOSH driven game
A wut?
6yeah well
DOSH?
6in this case
6it sucks
k
DOSH.
DOSH?
6you don't go to walmart for fabric
There were no other fabric stores around where I live
DOSH?
*are
EXPLAIN!
it's all about the DOSH
or don't
6since when does walmart even sell fabric?
02lol wow
did anyone else see the spartan head on that zombie back a few images ago?
"Current Global Users: 48 Max: 220"
MONKEY WITH A CHAINSAW!
I can work with that explanatiob
I'm with Roara on this. lmfao
I saw the crazy monkey.
Does that count?
much more funny to find out yourself
sure :P
02But for laughs, I'm still going with Darumaka
Derp is on.
It's been there, there isn't much to pick from, but it is there
6there are a lot of fabric stores online that sell for fairly cheap
9I doubt you can hear my mic
9but I'm gonna need to voice communicate during the game
Blitzcrank!
so the game is like fighting an evil circus?
If you aren't full I can join
Only for the dlc
9no Elky, it's fightan zombies
9Soarin
though I barely played it
9get your ass over here
9yeah
issue there is you have to pay shipping
02Aw bull no One Piece this week
Why is there a boiler-mech at a carnival?
okey dokey
9just for the seasonal event
circus zombies
why not?
which is a huge problem if you need something quick
9BECAUSE
EUROPE
spartan head!
9quality's pretty bad though
9let me fix that
DEM ARMS
6how quick do you need it?
DEM HANDS!
6my fur shipped in a few days, one of which was a sunday
At least, I think they were hands.
6also...what's your budget
02My kitten keeps trying to sit in the windowsill when it's not open
02:|
hands are too mainstream
6because unfortunately, plush making in itself is fairly expensive
I use hooks.
I use claws
I was hoping to just test how well I could do it, I was looking for <$20
what is #bronystatemods for?
Am I the only one that still has hands?!
is that that movie channel you're talking about?
>friend request sent
I only use custom imported paperclip constructions
6for an entire plush?
I have hands, their just not attached
oh, yeah, name's daaren on steam
It wasn't a complicated one
6I know but still
God Chainsaw monkey id freaky
6fabric runs usually at $5-$7 a yard
Nah, that's our mod channel.
6which is like minimum for a small plush
Which you can't get into anyway.
*is
It's just #bronystate
Damn hooks
6but that's also for really cheap fabric
9there we go
9fixed
ah
tbh, I don't see much of a diference
Ah
6if you can get ahold of antipill fleece, that's your best bet
not that it looks bad
6it's the cheapest for being still decent quality
it just was okay before too
You're able to buy less than a yard though, right?
6yeah
9look at the letters
alright, I'll be probably waiting for the mod to finish DLing so I can see if Shadow of Chernobyl is worth spending multiple hours on.
9much less fuzzy
hm
now I need a third monitor
for game, stream and irc
9images WILL be crisper like this
A third monitor would be so nice.
9I only have one
9and I deal w/it
for what?
one monitor for gaming, one for chat, the third...
if I wanted one I would have to comission one or settle for something
I can't sew
Streaming porn.
for constant pony episodes?
What else?
oh, that works too
Sewing isn't too bad. I sucked at it until I went to a convention and had to practice
For the extra awkwardness, have the porn play over your speakers so everyone else you talk to can hear it.
Aha! I found it! http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/28316
That would have bugged me all night.
It's not loading. What is it?
9it takes a while, dog
Ah, there it goes.
I'll look for that type of fabric though. I'd rather not order online unless I decide to commit, it's getting to the stores that is the problem
I hear you...
split up!
so I'm guessing this is kind of like L4D?
That always works in the movies!
It
It's more like COD zombies.
I actually passed up a giant stuffed Pikachu due to not much interest and being in a midway game that is impossible to win at the county fair
everything I know about zombies I learned for Evil Dead 2
Dat recoil
from*
Except with different types of zombies.
20 minutes remaining of waiting for the DL to finish
if it was a Togepi I would have gone for it
Machete. Coolest Melee, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
Those things are always rigged
Unless it's the "guess your weight" game
The guy over here that does it sucks
they are
that is why I passed it up
not worth the effort
They have some neat stuff though
Last year, they had a spongebob clock. Which sounds really childish but..
A spongebob clock! I wanted it
so I see that I'm on the screen :D

Oh that.
Steam is bugging out for you.
Happens all the time to me.

I think I'll try that modded SoC
I think I'll be leaving. Or closing the videostream at least

I expected shiny to walk in as his name was mentioned out of context again
lol
s/his/her
02That thing over there
and her fault for using highlights :P
the thing named shiny
NO I DID NOT NAME MY THING SHINY
you perv

02Not even in the back of your mind, you didn't think of me?
What did you name it then drf?
02XP
I didn't name it anything

DRF touches Shiny

I warned you lol
so don't say I didn't
that reminds me of this thing I read
back
Haha
I squit'd the server
?
dude me too
I was just making a joke. :P
lol I know :p
why so color
and jesus crap, I'm lagging like shit
XD
maybe he named his daughter after it
ya never know with celebrities.
LOL
always doin weird crap.
still, that whole article was a major facepalm
lol
he was trying to prove why Eminem is "bad for society"
and mixing facts up
rofl
he said Eminem made the song Hot In Herre
Pwned
well rap in general is bad for society
I was like, no.
but for different reasons
yeah, y u use n-word
so close to winning
Hubba wha?
Yet so far...
7Is dA borking for anyone else?
12somehow i read that as drf-bad
Lol at the ending.
6nope
03i
Atmosphere - ruined. XD
:P
03h x
7Hrm.
implying dA ever worked
I don't remember the last time that site loaded in under 30 seconds
12you mustered up the effort to change your nick
7Hrm.
7Eh, I can't put a comment on the site.
dA is one large trollfest
there are much better ways to share artwork
getting your own server and hotlinking anyone?
6well let us do as we please
drf
6some of us enjoy it
did I ever once say you can't do it?
7You're insinuating we leave it and find a better method.
I would rather break your phone :(
/me runs
6you're making it-
6what quan said
then you're taking what I say far too seriously.
which I suppose, I should be glad people actually listen to my rants :)
7Eh, I'll deal with you later, DRF.
12wb'
7Well, not me.
6or maybe for once just not say anything about what people should and shouldn't do
'deal with'?
6or inferring such
7Indeed.
6it's somewhat insulting, degrading, etc
She's clearly going to make you into cupcakes drf.
Watch out.
so in other words you can say w/e you want but I can't disagree?
XD
that's fair.
6...
7You can disagree, but not persuade.
6what did /I/ say
9we're live
I'm not persuading
6I normally say some remark against what you say
I just said dA is a large trollfest
Just saw it go back up.
6and that there's better ways to share artwork, and that we should find something else
I never said "you all suck if you use it"
7Yet 'dA is a large trollfest'.
yay impeding on freedom of speech, then? all I said was that there's better ways to share art, I never said you can't or shouldn't use dA
You guys need to pick up Alien Swarm 4p co-op and it's free.
6ok well you kind of do this all the time
so in other words
drf gave his opinion
6so it's getting really aggravating
again
and no one cares about it
again
lolol
Hey. Killing Floor. I have that.
let's try not to make this place into the trollfest, guys. lol
And I also have Alien Swarm.
That would make me sad.
6lol
9I bugged out
No-one really plays it anymore, though.
6this is a daily habit I think
6arguments and such
Yeah, I noticed that when I loaded it up a couple weeks ago.
9I have Alien Swarm 2
9got it off the free thing
6anyways, plush to work on
alien breed 2
not swarm
7Sprites to do!
if you think I argue on a daily basis, you should check your logs :) because I've cut back a LOT
Yeah, not the same.
man, that TST is such a trollfest
9oh that
9wait
9wasn't swarm the one you had to pay for?
9oh wait nvm
No
9wasn't swarm free?
Nope.
Swarm is free.
yes
Swarm is free.
/me in b4 Weird Al WHEN THEY SEE ME TROLLIN
7I miss the old topic.
+ modding tools.
which one?
Valve gave it away free last summer I think?
Make Parasprite Swarm.
I mean
cupcakes.
Lol.
Fund it.
It was around March '10
Alien swarm is one of steam's free games
no but really, which one?
fund it, like a product? lol
I wish they had made new missions for it.
LOL
probably the topic before things got all srs, drf. lol
most people just play it for the hat
Might have helped keep it alive a little longer.
I seem to recall the topic starting with the same message for years though
the one I'm positive I don't remember in the slightest
the topic of the conversation, not the chan lol
though you could be rebellious and change it :O
just to say you did.
I would, but to what?
I hated it when you'd get an "one man army" team member that'd leave everyone else behind.
/me runs
9we're live
LOL
Happened more on lover difficulties.
LOL
*lower
a little too short
02baaaack
Lover Difficulties
Are best difficulties
oh, the ones that go on speed runs without telling anyone?
It's not my fault I swear!
I wasn't trying to light you guys on fire!
02brb
...
Pretty much desert.
I lol'd.
What is this, twitter?
getting there, dari. lol
Just like "Fuck you! I'm going alone."
02LOLno.
EW TWITTER
etc
Kinda why I never really hung around the chat.
I started playing on hard after I met people doing that on normal. The higher difficulty inhibited that "one man army" crap.
Too much telling of every action. lol
02So true, lmfao
I know right
GUYS.
I AM TYPING.
just to let you all know.
If IRC was normally like twitter I wouldn't use it.
Makes sense
that and people confusing this channel with #RP
02NO WAY
So in other words.
Ray.
everytime people 'stab' each other etc
On lower difficulties I preferred melee only runs to running off on my own.
gtfolmfao
I mainly don't like this place for the script spam lol
9there
02D:
Hey! There we go!
9video finally fixed
p:
02now'll brb
02¬¬
there needs to be a channel exclusively for that.
XD
02#TMI?
02XD
no, for script spam lol
oh
02#ircgames
well good
we have one
Yeah.
so why is it still in here :(
because sometimes the chat goes dead?
Because mods can still spam it here.
:P
eh, fair enough lol
not really
Oh, so spamming scripts are fine when chat is dead.
just bugs me when people !_____ instead of actually talking.
10 second trigger limit
Grab the tech with the extra melee damage and the glove that dealt extra melee damage as well. One shots all the little guys.
regardless of mod status.
But talking about MLP when chat is dead. EENOPE.
is fine*
I never said *spamming* scripts
not my fault that !pokemon spreads like the plague
actually it is
it's all your fault drf
you monster.
Zed time annoys me.
k.
see
They should make it something activeatable, not random.
So who here likes to do when where there is after?
as much as I may be disagreeable, can anybody disagree that I keep the channel alive? :P
Yeah. Random bullet time is so annoying.
and o.O @ that line
7Eh, I think the channel will abound more without you. :P
7Or at least, have more productive discussions.
even though it's with rage half the time, that's true lol
>IRC
>productive
what is this I don't even
lolol
pretty sure those are the thesaurus under "antonyms"
Dammit, I'm at 6/7 for hard campaign.
yep
Yup :p
they are
7Yeesh.
DRF and I create tons of discussions
Hurp
^
7Good for you.
MFW I've used IRC productively a lot
well
drf talks a lot, obviously
the only server I've known to ever be productive is freenode
just half the time people rage at what he says
yeah, people take everything seriously
myself included lol
rule #1, don't take me seriously
then I remember I don't give a damn
:D
unless I say otherwise
7Sorry we don't appreciate your jokes.
/me shot
9but yeah
Quany, s/we/you?
9medical studies about how the brain percieves time during stress/fear
7s?
yes
^
9determined it can be somewhat random at times
9so yeah
s/a/b, replace a with b
9Zed time is, ironically, somewhat realistic
7Eh, you've probably figured from how many arguments you supposedly cause.
now that's some lazy markup. lol
so do I but I'm on a phone.
oh right
that thing.
lol
it takes longer to type
EW TXTSPK, but s/a/b is actually pretty well known.
also
not by me lol :(
I just kinda figured it out.
I find it funny how many other people use 'Ew', but I'm the only one who gets raged at
yay bias?
EW BIAS
^
I mean hey, you can't please everybody.
EW EW x
It's more like eugh in the UK anyway.
some people may get mad at me on occasion, but I think overall I bring conversation
no
conversation is not allowed here
gtfo
:(
LOL
Me?
yes you
I'd just keep my mouth shut about it. lol
orly?
Yeah.
Kinda like I'm not doing right now.
so whay would you say if a big slimy bug started crawling all over you
lol
or something you dislike
XD
I'd eat it.
knowing manly
he'd probably just look at it
and it'd burst into flames.
^
LOL
Wow, I almost never hit any allies on Landing bay, but my average is around 8.5 FF for the rest of the levels...
Well, the looking part, anyways. lmfao
fine, chuck norris.
rofl
when I see something weird, whether it's on me or not
I always go "the hell?"
One time I thought I had six fingers on my right hand
and I went "the hell?"
lol, you probably can :P
still, most people I know use the word ew in some way or another
*wakes up and sees clock on 7:15 even though he set the alarm for 6:00*
"the hell?"
7Well, Feather, I've chosen the colors and stuff.
02drf stalks the chat as much as I stalk the cbox
7Seems a bit desaturated; would you like it saturated or desaturated?
you mean spambox
but sure xD
though
doesn't stalking usually imply not talking?
02If people spammed there, but it's not really that bad as last year
That was annoying.
02No lol
Lurking does.
02Just that you're here almost all the time
My internet cut out.
02You're watching people, when they don't know it
LOL
inb4 rockwell
like a hawk
heh
Makes me wonder what all the other twenty people do. lol
idle
We can only imagine :P
and then complain about me behind my back, apparently.
:d
I only complan to your face. :)
LOL
7Hmm.

For the money.

I don't see bold on mIRC so...
since I have it strip bold to save me from getting irritated XD
lolol
You you stripped Shiny
you should have it strip text too while you're at it
well it's the default in sysreset anyway.
Shiny's text :p

*good
7TF2 blog update, what?
/me 7checks.
6note: it's going to be supported on DS systems
then it wouldn't be surprising
6not just 3DS
XD
:P
04huh
6but it wouldn't be surprising if-
6god
6GOD
6WHY
Shame :<
04DS games with 3DS support
6ARE YOU ALL
O.,o
6READING MY MIND
we did add food coloring
04XD
6AND SAYING STUFF FIRST
6:<
Your brother - scared to watch ponies - fighting over who ices cupcakes.
04:3
wut
Interesting.
04Cuz we like that Roara :3~
because we're pros
04ahaha Fatismu
your mind is all over the road signs around here roara :(
/me 7wonders if this is TF2 canon. O_o
02I want my RSE remakes :<
we put pink food coloring in, but it wasn't enough because they kind of turned peach instead of pink
saying stuff like "Speed Limit 45"
04That magazine announces things before anything all the time
aww
well, Roara. I can ask bluesun for more info
Pinkie Pie cupcakes?
he knows Japanese and reads those sorts of magazins
04Like Sonic Generations' confirmation of Chemical Plant and Stardust Speedway (\o/)
so we just added other random colors in each one and now they have colorful explosions
+e
lol, yeah :P
02And they seriously need to bring back the Pokeradar
STARDUST
Yues
LOLchaining
04YES
6I don't want RSE remakes
I do
only they're frosted with chocolate because that's all we had
04IT'S CONFIRMED
6RSE was perfect as it was
what they need to bring back are antivitamins.
04DRF you liked RSE?
RSE were the best games ever
Any music
;o
04Hahahaha
hmmm
So not quite Pinkie Pie cupcakes
04I know MANY people who disagree drf
02RSE was a great series.
04[21:05:37] 04DRF you liked RSE?
04I did
6RSE was amazing
Emerald is my all time favorite Pokémon game
Same here XD
then it all started going downhill.
/me tries to think of a peach pony with brown hair
6music, visually, I liked a ton of the pokemon in it
6storyline
Pokeémon are cool
the only thing I didn't like about Emeral
d
ONLY thing
6hurr
02:P
7Eh, can't really state much about it other than nostalgia.
was no running inside a la DP
04Storyline killed it for most people Roara
as I'm impatient and that got annoying
6lol
7!generate 1 66
Generated number is: 37.

04"WE'RE GOING TO COOL THE VOLCANO SO RAIN WILL FILL IT AND POKÉMON CAN SWIM IN THE WATER"
6woot
LOL
well
04"...You guys are villans right?"
02Wait I thought DP introduced running inside
6ok well that was stupid
it did
hence "a la DP"
04It was an excuse
6but the overall awakening of legendary pokemon, them duking it out and you have to summon rayquaza to stop it
6that's cool
02lol
and eh, I don't remember the story of emerald
just that it was awesome
04To let the stories coencide
6I just sumarized it lol
EVERYTHING ALL IN ONE PLACE YEAH
04Emerald fixed that
02It was the same thing except it was more neutral
04Roara that's Emerald not RS
except battle pike or w/e, that was dumb
/me 7meeps.
02And you had to wake up Rayquaza to stop the two titans from fighting
04Pike was cool
7Hey, Rora? You know ComicCon?
well
04though funny story
6yeah
Rayquaza is my all time favorite
so
:D
04I played Pokémon Emerald on my DS right?
04I'm at battle pike
except MACH BIKE RAAAAGE
04I have a penny
7If you happen to go there, stop by the WETA booth. XD
I played pokemon emerald on my GBC
you guys are noobs
/me runs
LOL
04I put it in my DS slot for good luck
LOLOL
6the one thing I hated about emerald was the call feature being brought back
:P
04This was when I had no grasp of hardware
/me hides
04YES
04XD
6you couldn't use the muddy slope egg hatching trick anymore
Haha
04It short circuted it
6because people kept calling
Some poor background pony.
04I WAS SO PISSED LOL
LOL people who use nickalert
6rayquaza is awesome end of story
^
see
when I say something agreeable
:(
nobody cares
:P
rayquaza is stupid
LOL
/me :OOOOOOO
why does my eye hurt </random>
poor background pony
...and when I say something disagreeable, no one cares
XD
/me runs
6http://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/0/01/Rayquaza_movie_7.png
6yes
6<3
no
6anyways, dinner
6gotta go
because we know youe being silly
Nice :p
Bai Rora
lol, maybe
LOL @ pic
it looks like a derp in thatl
its teeth
Yeah
are like durr
=Wtf XD
Quany, I don't push actions either. people just assume.
7No, you insinuate.
bidoof is strictly cooler than rayquaza and anyone who thinks otherwise is an ignorant twit
~
/me runs
that means people assume.
02I agree
and that's on them, not me.
LOL, Bidoof is useful as an HM slave
It teleported!
7Again, I will deal with you later.
bidoof is strictly inferior to Sunkern and anyone who thinks otherwise is an ignorant twit.
define 'deal with'
7I'm reading up on the new update elsewhere.
He regenerates health.
LOL Sunkern is so random
well, kind of
02The one who beats the E4 with a bibdoof is a PRO. Nothing else
the internet wasn't working and I tried resetting the router
Ray
nah, I'd say power to the man who beats 'em with a sunkern.
turns out I restored it to factory defaults
'cause you know
02bidoof*
strictly superior
Lol.
etc
:P
do you know about the glitch that let's you WALK to the hall of fame?
9yeah
9I know
9still a dick
so you can have only a level 1 bidoof
and profit
lolol
02LOL.
only works in Japanese games.
My dad either forgot or just never bothered to put the blocks back on
or English ones with an AR.
either way
Yay!
But he thought the router had been hacked, XD
I wanna make it to the hall of fame with a team of unown
Hahahaha.
spelling "L O L F A I"
XD
D:
I sure hope not
...arm ads. creepy.
already done that
:d
Shouldn't have trapped him in the room. Left you all nowhere to run in a failure situation.
/me shot
9that strategy tends to work though
LOL
9when we got a bunch of pipe bombs, that is
im in ur router, haxxing ur internets
No :P
For TF2, why are they giving the soldier even more weapons?
That's true.
XD
9because Valve hates the Engineer
But I ended up telling him it was me
YOU haxxed it?!
jk
He's been paranoid about being "hacked" lately
:P
4GHOSTIES HAS RETURNED
and 4 secs of disabling buildings will make it OP
:P I sure liked it
4How did you guys like Killing Floor?
I have so much crap around my desk.
I noticed what you meant by voldemort screaming the same scream like 5 times with this one
9Ghosties we gotta retry this shit
as things are right now
I can't move my chair
XD
4I'm worn out
You guys got raped by the last guy.
I posted my favorite pony trailers in pony spam, ignoring 36's trolling
4And I'm tired of playing on Abusement Park
that's my new strategy
9ah well
pretend he isn't there
9think I'll stop streaming now
He's still trolling?
4I honestly didn't think Normal was gonna be that fucking terrible
wow
I like Ontels' posts.
Just "spam".
Lawl.
he said I HATE PONIES like 50 times
9don't really got anything else to stream
9hey wait
9maybe I could try L4D for once
Ontels's strike me as whining
9a sec
/me rages
I hate calculus
whining about being told off for being too mean
4Me, Soi, Derp, and a close friend have triumped on a Normal long game before...don't know why he's so goddamn impenetrable at the Abusement Park
lololol
me too :(
my notes look like crap
∫
LOL
I'm sure I have notes somewhere.
Letter!
fnInt(x,x,0,1)
/me hides
but I haven't done it in like two years rofl
SF is such a steaming pile of crap now.
it really is
^ twss
I find myself getting annoyed every time I check on it
9I somehow got the achievement on hard
9probably due to the guys being with me being beast
4Probably
What achievement?
4Were you playing with Soi and Derp?
4Dog and a Pony Show, Nittany
LOL, the kid next to me is watching some sort of anime on his Droid
9Dog and Pony Show is for Hard, though
everyone is either an annoying little adolescent brat who whines about everything, annoying little adolescent brats who think they know everything, or both
LOL
9the achievement to get Steampunk Mr. Foster
Nice
with no audioo
-o
Shame
except us three
:P
ask him what is name of anime.
haha
inb4 nobody needs to hear whiny Japanese girks
*l
XD
LOL junh1024, nah
4The required achievement is at least completing a long game on Normal Difficulty at the Abusement Park
But Junh, we all know DRF can't hear anime names
:o
36 falls into both categories
do it, maggot.
4And then you can get Mr. Foster
as does ontels
/me hides
why
Haha, yeah he does
wynaut
/me rimshot
I used to not mind ontels
he watches me on dA and used to comment on my stuff sometimes
Oh u
http://www.imagebam.com/image/e0ed5e139552980
Oh u link
:p
http://www.imagebam.com/image/e0ed5e139552980
Such a small list of game. :(
Spam time >:3
is that a script now?
Steam sound always creeped me out.
Yes :|
Ontels' sole purpose there seems to be to try and troll and spam.
And they complain about script spam lol
skull make the pic
may I suggest hotlinking
at like
imgur
as EW ADS
It's from Hansaku Iroha
yes I block them, others don't
I hate how Steam games hate streaming when you play them full screen.
/me gives drf a cookie
I don't see anything
some people cannot access imgur and cbf
/me clears his cookies
wtf?
:o
I wonder why
12o-O
4There we go
what about tinypic then
Because they use a fail browser/thingie?
:p
4Looks good, DCD
/me hides
Lolol
He playin alone?
9guys apparently they uploaded my final grade for the semester
9let me check it out real quick
4Good luck man
/me crosses fingers
/me crosses fingers
I actually go on EQD way more than ponychan now.
Don't really go on ponychan any more.
Damn it dashi, you ninja

Good luck.
inb4 oh u asciiartspam

Panama University Student Services.
X?
4Sooooo?
4DCD?
9X means not uploaded yet

4Alright, man!
Ah
9so yeah
yay
Cool.
4CELEBRATE, WOO!
9no need to make any rehabilitation exams
What's quimicia?
9joy, joy
AAABCC
Quimica significa Chemistry in espanol?
:/
9mom will get pissed when she finds out I got a C on Biology, though
9eyup
when LL texts me "Done x.x", that's usually not a good sign
Aw
4DCD, what's General English like?
Hard working :<
How many can you name?
Fisico Mathematica = Statistics?
what are you studying?
far fewer than you, I'm sure
9it's witnessing the rambles and tantrums of a woman who doesn't know shit of english
:P
9I could impart a better class
No wait. Physical Mathematics.
lol
4Neato
9Soarin: Doctor in Medicine
9yeah Nittany, that
wow, neat
9next semester it gets a bit more...medical
What's in that?
9this was my second semester
Physical Mathematics?
I want to study biology, already applied for winter semester
4Dude, I know a game we could try to play sometime. Dead Island when it comes out
Yeah.
4Then again, that's assuming I'd pay $50 for it and my 2010 laptop can run it : /
Dead Island is one of the very few new games I'm interested in.
Well, you /are/ pretty good with Ingles. Don't see why you couldn't teach a pretty decent class.
/me doesn't know why he just typed Ingles
oh god
4INGLES
dat ingles
What is it now
o.o
It's actually ingle's.
4If you pronounce it as is, it really does sound funny
"when it comes time to figure out dominance" <-- SUGGESTIVE CALCULUS
This keyboard doesn't do accented vowels.
4Like "engulls"
What an odd class :P
Dem angles.
terms, ae?
4Almost like Tingle from Zelda
yeah
4But minus the "t"
I could never pronounce rr properly.
I always fucked up the ~'s
LOL
4Can't roll your tongue?
and '
I prefer a > b, but I suppose "a dominates b" just sounds hot ;o
Nope.
/me hides
4Don't feel too bad, I can't either ._.
you badass
Yay!
4RACCOON TIMES
I can~
4INFRINGMENT, I SAY
sup
uh...huh
4Sup, Soi
it's an add-on thing
XD
I can half-ass roll my tongue.
Hi.
Yo
I think
XDDD
hey ghosties
4Good game, man
/me bows
The Grreat and Powerful Trrrrrixie!
Need to change great message.
yeah, xD
Yes
Yes you do
Okay then
we should've won
inb4 angle-side-side triangle
damn patty
Have you tried the Helm's Deep L4D2 stage?
4Fucking Patriarch
Hola!
and those are bad
Never played L4D
"My mooooostache welcomes you!"
so... ispz that makes sense
4We threw EVERYTHING at him
yeah
Looooooool
You shouldn't have drawn him into such a small room.
nuh uh
that works
4It's like he's impenetrable at the Abusement Park
when he doesn't shoot missiles >>
4And drawing him in is the best way
There
4He can't sneak up on us and has to come to us in the front
Woah.
Lol.
The best way to kill him is to corner him.
But you have little room to get away from him.
true
4The best method I know is for everyone to just suddenly blast him
4With everything
we didn't have time to look for a better spot
if he takes a knee then he will die
4Oh, and I fucking loved Resident Evil Outbreak <3
4We got Patty on one knee, though
4But he came back
4Recuperated
I think I have that movie sitting in my living room unwatched.
you are more insane than I am drf
the door was left unguarded so he left to heal
4Cowardly Patty
math puns
This map has a really long intro...
are the first sine of madness
indeed
ahahahaha
4That's how it was in the original RE OUtbreak
GET ON WITH IT!
/me has never played a RE game
4It takes about 3 minutes to finish
4:O
lolol
XD
4Really, Dashite?
/me hasn't either
4Wha
4The hell is wrong with this chatroom tonight >: (
I don't count playing like 5 minutes of 1 and 4 each.
RE2 is my favorite in the series
4PEELZ
Peelz. Peelz errywhere
4SO MANY PEELZ
4PEELZ
4PEELZ never changes
I've played 4, 5 and Code Veronica.
PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELZ
I've played only 2.
They're fake. No way that guy would have died with that many peelz.
I have 5 on my PC.
I like how every bottle was standing completely upright.
Came free with my latest video card.
I've played all except 4 and 5
Crysis came free with my last video card.
4I've played and owned Resident Evil, RE Director's Cut, RE2, RE3, RE4, RE Code Veronica, OUtbreak, Outbreak File #2
And that card couldn't run it full-blast.
I remember there was this log cabin joke.
9BRB
9mom being annoying
aww
4I've beaten RE5, but refuse to buy it
Survival horror isn't really my thing and I was never really big into consoles so I haven't played a lot of games.
orly
TTFN DCD
4Oh, and Resident Evil Zero as well as the REmake for Gamecube
I never played RE because I used to hate FPS and I thought it was one. Still do.
I totally am Soarin
12drf has a steam account
daaren I mean
derp
12true or false
4But it's not an FPS, Razyn
lol
true
12true
12:)
RE isn't an FPS.
bridging the gap between two chats I see Soarin
12to see what happened XD
Ah, this is it.
so many chats, so many names
makes me confuss
What's the integral of (1/cabin)d(cabin)?
lol
12cabin fever o-o
Yeah... I'll just toss it into the pile of games I need to play along with MGS Golden Sun and most of the pre VII Final Fantasies.
A natural log cabin.
oh
4A lot of the people that were playing in DCD's stream are in the chat now
log(cabin)?
ln(cabin)
ah lol
/me hides
And others... So many games to play.
4AND YOU'VE NEVER PLAYED METAL GEAR SOLID
I used to know how to do logarithms
then I woke up.
lol
>_>
Lol.
4Time out for Razyun
bbl
4*Razyn
I only played MGS1
it was great though
4Never once played MGS...what kind of fucked up world do I live in *shaking head*
Yeah! I mean WTF Razyn?! Never played MGS?! *hasn't played it either*
This reminds me, I still need to finish MGS3.
I've played MGS1 - 4. Beat 1 - 3.
I need to finish 4.
Well, I grew up on platformers, and kind of grew biased towards them in a sort immature way.
4Yes, Nittany, you do
4MGS4 was simply put, brilliant
I've never played MGS.
I wanted to play 2 and 3, but by that time PCSX2 wasn't decent enough to play at anything above 10 fps
I should try it again
Hurray for Dari!
4Even if the majority of its detractors believe it's convoluted
I honestly just want to meet Ocelot. That's the only reason I'm considering playing MGS.
If the rest is cool too, so be it.
A lot of people I know complain that it's more of a movie than a game (as in, cutscenes too long).
4Yeah, there is that
I don't really care.
4A lot of people consider it like an interactive movie, and I also really don't care
Fourth one had an hour long cutscene
4One of the biggest reasons I play MGS is for the story, and 4 doesn't fail to deliver
I enjoyed every second of it
Hour long cutscenes... at what point does it stop being a game?
That actually doesn't sound half bad. I like story, which is why I attached a negative stigma to FPSs.
when you play Heavy Rain
that's no game...NO GAME
Is that possible?
I mean, playing Heavy Rain...
4What
no
4Heavy Rain was a great game
you simp[ly watch
4I still enjoyed it
I've only played a demo of Heavy Rain. Would like to get it.
4Love the story
4Loved the characters too
First you need to get an old school hockey mask.
X
X
that's how
This sounds like something dirty.
X
O
=>
4But if Razyn or anyone else considers playing MGS4, you had better play through the other MGS titles first
4Or else you will not have the slightest inkling as to what is going on
I don't disrespect stories like that.
Δ
What about the MSX ones?
4It's advisable, but definitely not necessary. You get the backstory for those in MGS1
I have those on a PS2 disk. Got stuck on #1
4Metal Gear 2 is SOOOO much better than Metal Gear 1
Hurray for youtube!
I'll most likely pick it up from the PSN.
Because PS Roms scare me.
4Is it on PSN?
4Metal Gear Solid, that is?
Eeyup.
I think so
What happened to the stream?
4DCD says to let you guys know he can't stream anymore tonight. His mom wants to talk to him about his grade
I just found The Essential Collection on Amazon.
DCD's not here
What happened to the /streamer/?
oh my
Oh hai. Alien swarm just finished. Wonder how far I can get solo.
Damn
4But, Razyn, I definitely don't think you'll regret it. Metal Gear Solid is one of the very best experiences I've ever had playing a video game
Well, I'll go and try to get one of those new weapons in TF2
Nn... It might not topple FFIV, but I'm still trying it.
4But yeah, sorry guys. Look's like the stream's over tonight :(
I'm one of those people that haven't played FF7.
4Still trying what, Razyn?
Haven't played a FF game at all here.
...MGS.
Same.
I have FF12.
Haven't touched it.
4Right, sorry, my mind derped for a moment >.<
you haven't missed much :p
And it's a collector's edition.
4But great, glad you're gonna try it out
be one of the cool kids and play wrpgs instead
4I've played FFVII, VIII, VIX, X, and XII
I don't play many RPGs. Up until now, I've been a FPS person.
4I've owned X and XII
IV is my favorite video game ever.
4And I tell you this, no of those games listed holds a candle to Final Fantasy X
Now that FPS are steering from being SP games, I'm going towards something else.
4None of the FF I listed aside from X, that is
4SP as in single player, Nittany?
there's still bioshock and deus ex coming up
for good singleplayer fps games
Yeah.
I suck online.
I can't get into BF games because they're fucking difficult.
BF?
Battlefield.
difficult? nah
4Ah
Battlefield?
4Bioshock was a tremendous game, btw
just takes a while to learn how to not die in 2 seconds
It was.
4Didn't care at all for Bioshock 2, though
Bioshock 1 and 2 are briliant
bioshock 2 had the gameplay
really?
Soarin, I don't have the patience.
I liked B2
4Really
I can't kill shit on there.
huh lol
while bioshock 1 had more story and development
4I HATED the tunnelvision that went along with being a Big Daddy
I can be a kick-ass medic, but it's no fun when you die 15 times per game.
yeah
well, I'm kinda looking forward to bf3
DX 11 all the way
since it's supposed to be more realistic
4And that's right, Bioshock 1 had the story
than certain other shooters
And no matter how many bullets I throw at the enemy, I end up dying.
4That's what I mostly cared about
4And Andrew Ryan was a great character
bioshock infinte is really shaping up excellent
And I end up feeling like a drag on the team. There's just so many things that make me frustrated in BF.
the whole setting is so interesting
I dunno what you're talking about...the Call of Duty series has the best storylines :p
BF2 left a permanent bad taste in my mouth.
4As was Atlas, even though I think Fontaine was a fairly interesting character as well
CoD used to be great.
USED to
Now it's just a whore w/ Bobby Kotick being the pimp.
I can't stand him.
amen brony
He's ruining the gaming industry.
4A lot of people don't like Kotick
Yeah.
/me doesn't know who Kotick is
yep
aka Activision's CEO
He's the big jew on top of Activision Razyn
I want to get people together to protest AAA games in order to cut sales because I hate the AAA gaming industry.
Kotick is evil.
4Used to be that EA was the Evil Empire, but most people have turned their sights to Kotick and Activision
He openly admits it.
He openly admits to milking his customers.
EA got a lot better lately
And taking the fun out of making games.
EA is still bad, but Acti is evil
No, EA is getting worse again.
yeah the origin thing
That.
is pretty bullshit
4Definitely
mhm
4After Dragon Age II, EA is looking pretty shitty once again
Dragon Age is bioware
4And it's not the actual game that I blame either, it's EA's customer support
They banned two people from playing DA 2 because of things they said on a forum.
4Exactly
EA is only publishing it if anything
EA is a terrible publisher.
4But EA was the one that pushed Bioware to finish
All they want is to control your games even after sale.
4They were forcing Bioware to release as quickly as possible
And then they championed something I hate: Online Passes.
that doesn't change anything, Bioware is responsible for shitty design choices
4So we basically got an unfinished game
12hot out ><;
12VERY so
:<
/me ices
4They didn't have enough time to work everything out though
No. EA is responsible for rushing games out to meet deadlines.
Are you sure it isn't something else
4To be honest, Bethesda is kinda feeling the burn too
Activision is the same.
/me 12holds ice against every inch of her body ><;
4After Brink, and the shit fest that game turned out to be
7Hmm.
12it prolly is something else too :/
7I'm getting very close to my limit for DRF.
:|
Aww
12hmm?
12what'd he do this time? o.o
All AAA publishers are becoming the same: putting profit above the love of the art.
7Upset more people.
4Of course
7As usual.
EA has awesome customer support.
And I know a lot of gamers know that.
How?
4What, Dashite?
But no-one's doing anything about it.
12^
4You're joking
4Right?
Except I've tried.
Nope. Every time I've had to call them, I've gotten my issues solves in 10 minutes of less with no hassle.
7You know, his dissuasion of certain tools and implication toward his preferences.
4Well
But you know XBL kids won't listen to "That guy that makes CoD is stealing your parent's money."
4Don't ever complain about their game...EVER
people actually call instead of use google? ;)
4Or else they'll lock you out of it
12in other words, same-old same-old :/
7Yep.
12well
Things are terrible when publishers can lock you out of your own games.
12good news for you all
12if he's de-Opped
4Yep yep
7He will be, I'll make sure.
12he's going to leave TST permanently
Valve could do it if they feel like it, but they have a heart.
I've never used customer support. Even when I was like seven, it just sounded so... Archaic.
12then he's as good as gone
7Good for the rest of us.
Orly nao
Verizon has the worst customer support ever. They tried to automate everything.
4It's an abhorrent practice: If you publicly badmouth a game, the publisher will lock you out of playing it again
And if you do get a person, they can be rude as hell.
Yeah.
I really want to get verbal protests together.
We need to throw a 'Goodbye DRF' party then
12I wish I could sympathize with him but he brought it upon himself v.v
What exactly does a lock entail? You own it, you should be able to play it.
/me 12slaps Hyper
:<
4Valve may have a heart, but DAT GABE NEWELL
/me faints
Not according to EA Razyn
Sony still owns your PS3.
Microsoft still owns your Xbox.
4If they lock you out, you can't access your saved files and you can't play the game
What, I can't use online? I don't get it.
What.
How.
When you buy EA games, you have to tie them to a central account.
With an EULA
4It's DRM
4Which means that they can take away the game from you at anytime
And if you break that, they can terminate your account.
4Digital Rights Media, basically
4All their top games are like that now
12o-o
wow RDS FAIL
[03:07] <Nittany_Tiger> Sony still owns your PS3.
MFW they don't
Pokmon What Happened To You
They claimed to.
the accented e is an illegal character in RDS
Not validated by law at the moment I'm fairly sure.
Well, they told everyone they couldn't have Linux.
And they took it away.
02Hiya LL
Yet people have linux anyway.
And they could because of the EULA.
Illegally.
12hiyas Shiny~
And they got sued multiple times when they did it.
not only that my RDS reverted to what I had before on FM
02You should play with Manly and I
Those lawsuits are still bouncing about.
/me is actively searching for a game that could be taken away from him
12if this keeps up, I'll have to join you as a Fire-type
12hmm?
/me in his library
And Sony has enough money to win those lawsuits.
12join you as a fire-type?
12what
Money doesn't help you win.
12nvm
02:P
EULAs do.
unless you do stupid stuff nothing gets taken from you
12what is this some sort of PMD MMO
12how do you mean, Shiny?
/me 7hmms.
Unless they break the law.
12no Glacy o.o
12and ._.
/me 12shudders
12o-O
12there was
12a
12HUGE bug
4If you own Spore, that's DRM
Which is what the lawsuits are trying to prove that Sony did with the Linux removal firmware.
12under my shirt ><
12i saw a giant dragon fly earlier
12cool things
Yay SecuROM.
12at work
02Was it Vicky's bug of evil?
I didn't even know about SecuROM when I bought Spore.
12no
12lol shiny
12but
Nor install limits.
12it kinda looked like an oversized grasshopper
7I mentioned a giant cockroach-thingy a few days ago trapped in my window.
02Cicada?
12praying mantis?
Sony didn't even outright win the lawsuit on geohot.
They just settled.
12i saw an earwig a couple days ago
12those things creep me out
Geohot had to get money together to hire good enough lawyers to stay in the battle.
12not a cicada
12and Glacy
12I HOPE it wasn't a praying mantis
Geohot has also pissed many people off.
He got 1000s in donations.
12tho
12praying mantises are harmless
12it kinda looked like it...
He actually started everything.
its one of a couple bugs that don't make me nervous
I had one crawling on my arm before and it kind of tickled
LL!
Hai!
I think anyone who is angry at geohot's an idiot.
praying mantis's are cute :>
12oh frak
/me 12googled pics
When he announced that he broke the PS3 hypervisor, lazy, anti-consumer Sony took away Linux.
It's his PS3, he can do what he wants with it.
12it looks JUST like it ._.
I hate Sony for what they did.
12and I killed it...
awws
4I actually own Spore
Taking away Linux when they could have patched the issue.
4And I knew about the DRM
12:<
12may I remind you
12it was
12IN my SHIRT
12in or on?
lol
12IN
12with an "I"
Sony still continues to treat their customers like idiots.
/me 12shudders
12i see the I
12it felt...ew
12i know how you felt trust me
They only got a little humble after being hacked.
12crawling all over me
12one time i was in the back yard
12when i felt something bump the back of my leg
12i look and there is a huge freaking spider there
12.______________________.
That's generally how you treat your cattle, isn't it?
12like as thick as my leg sitting there
12Black Widow?
12no
12wolf spider i think
12good
12whoa .-.;
4As long as people put money in their hands, they're gonna continue doing it
scary!
Except we're not cattle.
I almost bumped into a wolf spider nest before
12make matters worse
12i already had a fear of spiders
ikr?
12oh fun
4Admittedly, I thought it was neat when Sony was like "WE'RE SORRY FOR BEING DOWN, HAVE FREE STUFF" and gave everybody about 6 or 7 games for free in total
12arachnophobia
12common
Yeah.
12and something that large...
I look in the mirror, I see a man, X sees me they see a guy willing to give money for the next big shiny.
yup., I have it o.o
/me 12shudders
I think wolf spiders are relatively harmless
12I have it to a point
but still that would freak me the hell out rofl
12it's size-related
very much so
little ones I can kill fine
/me 12nods
big ones....o.o;;;;
12Wolf-Spider sized...
Anyway, yes people do actually call customer support some times.
4Funny thing is, I bet most of Sony's consumers were mad at the hackers who knocked them down a peg
/me 12shivers
and MN has huge spidahs D:
I think the worst bug I've dealt with down here was
in the woods
well this one time a lizard showed up in my room.
that was kinda cool.
I thought the hack was funny.
12o-o
coolio, I'd be like "awws, that's cute!"
Even though my info got stolen.
/me 12lols
I took a buncha pictures lol
12reminds me of when I vacationed to Disney
I called EA up once when the serial key was misprinted on one of their games. They gave me a new one.
12there were
Sony deserved the hack.
12wolf spiders, their venom might cause a little itching and swelling
12MILLIONS of geckos
12but otherwords they are harmless
Took like 5 minutes.
CA or FL, LL?
mfw I have 32 cents from psn cards on my account
12but none of them saved me 15% or more on car insurance ;-;
12FL
ahh
rofl :(
They put a target on their back when they removed Linux.
and yeah there are geckos everywhere
12XD
12the thing is though that it doesn't matter where you live
12they're cute
12:3
I think the one that showed up in my room was one.
Also when they sued about 50 people.
Before they removed Linux, the PS3 was unhacked.
to this day I don't know how it got in there
12if it's in it's natural habitat or if it hitch hiked a ride from elsewhere
What did Linux do, exactly?
Big companies are stupid.
brown recluses are scarier than black widows imo D:
N E C R O S I S
/me 7hmms at this conversation.
12brazillian wondering spiders are more scary than both
It was officially called "OtherOS." It was an option to install an alternate OS on the PS3. 99 times out of 100, it was Linux.
12*wandering
12sorry
12necrosis?
;o
causes the flesh around the bite to decay.
It provided people with a crappy but cheap computer.
it's ugly to look at.
Something a lot more open than the Xbox 360.
12EW EW EW
12I saw the images
will not post pics XD
12can't unsee
12><;
lol
4Speaking of which, I'm surprised no one's taken Microsoft and Live down yet
/me 12feels nauseas again...
I'm surprised no-one's hacked Activision yet.
/me gives LL a bucket
KFC Chicken Bucket
4It wouldn't matter if they did, Kotick wouldn't give a shit
Microsoft probably look after Live much better.
So, a computer on your game console was... Good?
/me 12o.o
Since it's a paid service.
12o-o
Sounds more like a novelty to me.
12nice try
/me poofs into a dolphin
12eye c u dun liek KFC
.,.
4As long as Kotick and Activision have CoD, they could care less about anyone else
Yeah, but it was something for some people that couldn't afford or didn't want a separate PC.
I leik KFC
:p
A fair number of people bought the PS3 because of otherOS.
Kotick also has WoW.
12KFC is amazing
IT is the only fast food franchise around here
12then why give some to a nauseas Lati?
anyone care about respawn entertainments new game?
Could care less?
Because you need food!~
12isn't the best idea
4Oh, couldn't care less
Yep. Could care less.
Oh.
Just confuses me when people say could care less. O_o
12^
4That too, though. WoW is a big money maker for them
lolol
12I hope
Only for Kotick.
12that tomorrow night
talking about KFC is generally not a good idea
/me runs
12won't be as bad
Not for the rest of Activision.
12BL is sleeping over~
And I don't think Kotick gives a shit about the rest of Activision.
12:3
4I remember when Activision wasn't all that big in the late 90's - early 2000's
o.o
12Black Latias?
Have fun
12*Latios
It wasn't a big deal to me until I learned about his DICE speech in 2009.
/me 12nods
12ayups
12wow
I've hated and boycotted the company ever since.
12who would have known you two were so close
02You didn't know?
12XD
And hoped that people had the brains to do the same.
02.-.
12i know it ;-;
12Glacy, you're the last to realize :3
Every November, I'm sadly disappointed.
12we live in the same village
12i usually always am lol
I don't ever recall playing an Activision game. At least not at length.
12ahh
And I liked CoD, too.
02Yup, just gotta finish tricking my mom to go to Pizza Doctors
12about 10min walking distance
12XD
12have you shown her the video?
War for Cybertron doesn't deserve to be boycotted.
12?
/me Now Playing: Nyan Cat (Official Instrumental)
XD
12which video?
02Yeah, I did
1210 minutes isn't too bad
I'm not giving that greedy bastard a cent.
12oh
12not@me
I'll buy Acti games used if I want them.
12yes not at you
02It's called Outrageous Foods, it was featuring a pizzaria in La Crosse
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulw1uJ9dPzg
Surprisingly, Acti has so far not cared about second-hand sales.
[1,0You0,4Tube]: Pizza Doctors La Crosse featured on Food Network Outrageous Food | by QTHcom | Length: | Views: 3 143
02I'll be the person who's only ordering pepporoni pizza and the dessert pizza
12XD'
All of the other publisher want to punish people who buy used games or (unintentionally) rent them.
12i'll be the person ordering extra spicy
12i'll probably suggest they get like habaneros or something
12and make a spicy beast
02And then I'll be giving you weird looks
12lol
12i'll be offering you a slice
I understand they're not making money, but the crap they're pulling is insane. No other industry does stuff like this.
Controls your products post-sale.
This is the first I've heard of that.
And tries to get their hand into the used market.
You think other industries wouldn't if they could?
4EA does it now
02I couldn't deal with spicy foods
4And Warner as well
EA does it. THQ does it. Sony and Ubisoft are going to do it.
Warner does it?
12i need spicy
12it's like my fuel
How?
Ubisoft is much worse.
4If you bought a used copy of Mortal Kombat, you couldn't play online against people unless you bought an Online Pass
02that's coffee for me
4They're following EA's path
Ubisoft had that damn online connection requirement.
Sony's probably the worst company though.
4That's how they get you in used sales
04mew
04hi LL
They put God damn rootkits o ntheir CDs.
They dropped the always-on DRM.
on*
Sony created SecuROM.
:>
4One good place online to get games is gog.com
So all of this control just affects online stuff?
4DRM free
12hai Chime
Securom, still not as bad as Starforce.
PORNY
I heard that Starforce ruined CD drives.
6DAMMIT.
I bought one game with Starforce.
I don't think anyone else has done that.
i cant wait for the dreamcast 2
I'm done with consoles.
I'm never gonna let you live that down ;P
I was a regular on the Galactic Civilizations forum when Starforce devs decided to post links to GalCiv torrents in an argument about games without DRM.
http://forum.darkspyro.net/spyro/viewposts.php?topic=40318&page=3
lawl
Because Sony got sued left, right, and centre then too.
02LL
02play with us :<
Fail.
Honestly, DRM is useless.
The games still get cracked.
6o.o
Ubisoft's lasted a month.
And it probably had 90% of it's sales in the first 3 weeks.
12what you playing?
Yeah.
Mission Accomplished.
6I SEE A PORNY PRANCIN'
I heard that many people tried to take their copies back because they couldn't play their copies due to connection issues.
I knew exactly how they'd react
For which game?
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/Hotel_Mario.jpg LOL at this pic, I just noticed Mario's leg is in the wrong place
I know that DRM is used to ensure high first-week sales.
XD
6The ponies? o.o
12play wat? o.o
AC2.

Ah
With retarded ass pictures that aren't even funny
Indie developers are win.

not pony related but I still think this is something we can all enjoy
I love the indie market.
:P
02Pokemon Vortex
12hotel marios what
!define pokemon vortex
-!- Whether the page requires plug-ins such as Flash
12lol
6Gage! I haven't seen him forever! Oh wait..It was Mage,wasn't it.. ._.
Instead of DRM, they'll sometimes hold "pay what you think it should be worth" sales.
12wb
LL, i think i had a CD-i once XD
I don't usually say this, but: lol.
03thanks
/me updates his Xbox
12i'm updating something right now
The developers of World of Goo did that.
12but you don't want to know what it is
12wbs Danny
Mage...
After they learned that they had a 90% piracy rate.
12TOLD YOU there was an update
Wow.
12@Danny
03yeah
But I think games with DRM have the same rate.
03that's odd though
03as mine didn't need to update yesterday
Oh.
12mine's speshul :3
6iFail..
12i better update mine D:
6Wow..these people hate everything.. o.o
I would have thought indie games would have lower piracy rates because people would feel worse about pirating their games.
It's not just some massive company who doesn't give a shit about you.
HAHAHA!
No.
12hi
You must be new here.
XD
Lawl.
that cat's jaw almost looks unhinged
Haha, yeah
I know, but that's the spyro fandom for ya
Indie games may suffer more from piracy.
Pay what you want. "Okay, 0.00 it is!"
LOL
I would condone it since I support indie developers.
I think they have a lot more heart than AAA publishers.
"Uh guys... if you're gonna pay 0.00 anyway, could you please you a torrent instead of our official download servers. :/"
6This other person added elephants to their list but put a little heart next to them? :|
"Eh... No thanks. Your link is clean."
They wanna tap dat elephant
That's not always true that indie developers are all heart.
03http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uPpZ2kbeL.jpg <- XD @ something a friend showed me
6D:
12not surprised
But at least they're not stuck behind a AAA publisher who's going to force them on a schedule.
A guy I saw had a angry birds shirt
12blah my neck still hurts a little
What're you talking about?
With the exact same text :|
Hmm?
I wonder if open protests could seriously happen against AAA publishers.
Well anonymous organised one against Sony which was a fail.
6DREAM OF MIRRORS FTW
Anon organized a hack attack.
I can't picture a protest working in this day and age.
I'm talking about verbal protests.
They did Nittany_Tiger.
They were DDoSing some of Sony's sites, then people complained at them that PSN was going down or something, so they stopped DDoSing.
And organised protests outside Sony stores.
What's verbal protesting?
People actually go to Sony Stores?
Yeah.
There are Sony stores?
lovely
So they say.
I'm not sure how successful it was, not very I'm thinking though.
Like people picket-signing against AAA publishers.
Petitions fail.
03so about those pokémon games
03<bluesun> apparently said interview was in a magazine released tomorrow
Online boycotts fail.

LOL time travel
Needs to get organized or publishers will continue to greedily destroy gaming.
Nothing danebo just likes selling out
What part of gaming is being destroyed, exactly?
Ownership for one.
6o.o
Mhm.
most of the "popular" youtubers do
The "Pay for the game once and you own it. No other fees." It's going towards having to continuously pay to play games.
03<bluesun> "A feature which even adults can enjoy, 'The Summer of Pokèmon, The Summer of Japan'. Along with the newest information ranging from the games to the movies, a special limited magazine-only 'password' for use in 'Super Pokèmon Scramble' is included! Unmissable for fans!"
Activision wants to slide that in with CoD Elite.
Hello DLC!
Now stop right there.
I never have to do that.
You will.
Is it just certain kinds of games?
When?
It hasn't expanded beyond MMOs yet.
03> so no RSE remakes yet? :X
03<bluesun> but that seems to be about the whole article rather than the specific 'o were making more games'
03<bluesun> I'd guess not... or at least no RSE publicly announced
It's not yet, but Activision will start it.
Like I said, CoD: Elite is the beginning.
It's going to start because companies get loads more money this way.
I wouldn't say all.
But a lot.
It's a good thing I mainly play single player!
>_>
Online. Well, now that I know we're playing in a different ballpark I can breathe easy.
Noooooooooooooooo
I was about to own him

Kind of why MMOs are raking in the money now.

If I had more friends to play BF2 or BC2 online, I would get into the game enough to maybe become good at it. As it stands, I just can't get into it with random people.
Lol.
Twilight bootup for android.
Anyway, publishers will continue to punish gamers who buy used.
!umbreon
The trick is to find a server you like and get to know the regulars on that server.
YES

12heh
I'll get on a server I had a good game on, and do shitty the next day.
03OK so
03whoever said the new Pokémon game won't be 3DS only

03<bluesun> for the 3DS game
03> supposedly it wasn't going to be 3DS only though?
03<bluesun> >camera
03<bluesun> >AR markers
03<bluesun> >3D
03<bluesun> not 3DS-only, wut?
I don't remember the last time I bought a used game that was still being sold in stores.
is this on a dif server?
I buy more used now because of my limited income.
03of course it is
Also, I was robbed last December and have a gaming library to rebuild.
03have you ever heard of someone named bluesun on TST? :P
12o-o
http://i.imgur.com/e2Rns.png
And I'm not spending $50/game to rebuild it.
03o_O did you update the script
12;-;
03?
Pointless stuff is strangely fun.
I don't see the point in saving buying used to save $5 when I can wait a month and get it for $20 or more cheaper.
I buy some used now to deny publishers I hate money.
Quickscopes on MW2 were completely pointless, but once I'd played the game to death, they stayed fun for ages afterwards. INB4 CoD hate
12?
12maybe
I don't hate CoD.
12people complain about the ownership script
12so i made it more unique
03I'd just get rid of it if I were you
And I can't aim, so quickscoping for me is out of the question.
Haven't bought a CoD game since 2.
12brings attention to myself
12so no 8D
I bought 1, some derivatives for 1, 2, 4, and 6 (MW2).
I stopped there after my Activision ban.
lol
03anyway Aurora did you see what I pasted
12Aurora sit
um
I play the SP and briefly touched the MP.
Lolwut XD
03the new game is supposedly going to have camera features and AR markers so it's hard to believe they wouldn't make it 3DS only
blue's stuff-
I played MW2's MP and found limited enjoyment.
um
03he's getting it from the official Japanese sources
I can barely get killstreaks of 2 or 3.
03Serebii is just a guy who posts everything he hears from someone else hence why I don't trust it :P
12what is even in this xbox update anyway
thats the pokedex stuff you do know that right?
12it's massive
03I'll ask
when I see Wrex in Mass Effect 3 I will not be able to help but think of this
03but supposedly this magazine doesn't even come out until tomorrow
Hooray for care packages, though.
03that serebii supposedly has

I always play through SP completely first, then play MP.
Which annoyed my friends wanting to play MP. XD
12are we friends yet on XBL?
12i don't know
12i know drf is
12but we don't do much except spy on eachother
basically
12ah
unless you can tell me otherwise
that victini is for the AR capabilities of the 3D pokedex
Actually, I was into Halo 3's MP a lot.
But not deathmatch and stuff.
03oh, yeah he said that was about the 3D Pokédex
I loved custom matches and Infection.
And Grifball.
and that is 3DS only
I can't play console FPS. :/
lol 3DS
I also played a lot of UT2K4.
Well at least you don't rage at people who play console FPS.
03> <Aurora> thats the pokedex stuff you do know that right?
03<bluesun> the 3D Pokedex?
03<bluesun> that's what I was talking about
03> yeah
03> she's talking about some supposed entirely new game that was announced in this magazine which serebii supposedly has even though it's not out yte
03<bluesun> that's a code that when scanned will give you a higher chance of unlocking Victini
03> *yet
03<bluesun> yeah, I know
03> that's what I was asking about, not the 3D thing
03<bluesun> and I very muc hdoubt serebii has it
03<bluesun> he had to pirate BW :P
Mainly Onlsaught, Assault, and Invasion.
03* bluesun runs#
"I'm superior because I play on a computer"
I don't play FPS
I might be 1% better on console FPSs.
Why would I rage at them? They may be doing it wrong, but that doesn't really affect me.
:p
I though I would be better at PC FPSs.
But nope.
the interview about the new game came from famitsu
At least online.
Doing it wrong? Lawl. So you are a stuck up PC gamer. :P
not just serebii
http://bulbanews.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Famitsu,_Pok%C3%A9mon_CEO_hint_at_%27surprise%27
03you do realize that bulbagarden just pulls its information from other sites
03so they probably got it from serebii's post
03oh, but yeah. the magazine comes out tomorrow
Nittany_Tiger: Most people have to invest quite a lot of time to get really good, and a lot of people value their time to much to do that, or don't have enough free time to do so.
MFW it's HD.
I'm one that doesn't like to play a lot.
And you won't notice the difference between 30 FPS and 500 FPS probably. :P
MFW it's upscaled
MFW on PS3 it isn't, on Xbox it is.
http://i.imgur.com/MvaQ2.jpg
03bluesun said he'll translate the interview
03I kind-of don't trust Serebii's translations
I would love to see this happen in season 2
03they translated some of the soundtracks completely wrong to the point that it's embarrasing
MFW PS3 is still has no gaems or AA. :p
Someone needs to update the topic
/me has a PS3...
as NS isnt away anymore XD
That's why I don't like XBL's fee. Inhibits people like me to try MPs out for free.
Hahaha.
That'd be great. XD
I have a PS3 and 360.
Anyway, I don't like paying a fee just to see if I like a game online or not.
I'll just buy it on PC.
or PS3.
/me has a PS3
I hear a lot of XBL fanboys dis PSN.
Especially when I complain about the fee.
Meh, console wars are annoying.
Honestly, I always thought that Microsoft could make /at least/ online gaming free.
The rest can go die. I just want to play online a bit.
They could, but why would they?
They won't.
They hooked too many people into paying the fee when the Xbox came out.
I thought console fees were bad back them because you could play online for free on PC.
/me 4doesn't have a PS3 :(
Again, people don't think. They just buy.
Aww, poor ghosties.
/me has a launch model PS3.
Not too cheap to get nowadays.
/me is slim
Ghosties: You're not missing out on much.
Other than GT5.
Launch models can play PS1 and PS2 games.
/me has launch model 600 GB PS3
GT5? Meh.
:p
Well, if you like racing games that is. :P
4Metal Gear Solid 4
I have it mainly for the exclusives.
4That's enough for me to warrant a purchase of a PS3
^ Other than that one.
Yeah, they can play PS1. Maybe I could just borrow MGS...
Free online play got me.
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/epic-fail-photos-animal-identification-fail.jpg
I heard MGS4 was pretty crappy anyway.
But now I avoid online play because I'm not fond of the community.
4You heard wrong
Disgaea Series. Point of having PS3
Oh yeah, it's a horrible game.
Or the frustration I get.
whats up with your channel?
>_>
6p
I just noticed it on the network a few days ago
6*
Not one redeeming factor.
:3
6How is you?
Ah, that's the channel for a stream that I moderate for.
:D
Good, i got twilight sparkle today :P
4Seriously, MGS4 is one of the very few games I'd consider art
We moved over here when there were continuous netsplits on another network during a stream.
6o.o
Well, I moved the channel over here anyway.
Ghosties gets saddle sore whenever someone disses MGS4.
This amuses me.
I was in there
ohai BL
it seems like nonsense
whats the topic?
2hiya :o
Yeah, we were streaming a movie.
People were talking about it.
Oh like a chatroom for while people watch the movie
I see
It's kind of fast with 200+ people though.
4Watch Razyn not return >.>
whats the site?
:p
4The best way to experience the game is if you've played all the titles
4Actually
Ghosties be all up in dis place, kicking people left and right.
12hiyas :D
4The VERY best way to experience MGS4 is if you grew up with the series
6http://twitpic.com/4tf09m Icy :3
There he is.
4Like I did
4I first played MGS when I was 11
I set up a site with a proper (sort of, .co.cc) domain.
Who, me?
But we haven't switched over to that yet.
I can't play MGS4 w/o an HDTV. Text is too small.
whats bronies?
4And completed MGS4 when I was 21
o.lo
OHnoes
Fans of the new My Little Pony TV series.
4Yes, you, Razyn :P
/me Now Playing: Just Dance 2 - Move Your Feet
Oh you guys.
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/epic-fail-photos-dr-name-fail.jpg
"<Ghosties>: Watch Razyn not return >.>"
I think theres more fan art of MLP than all other TV series combined.
Hahaha.
Haha... Yes. Well, I'm not very familiar with meebit. So I refreshed a couple of times.
4Ah, glad you got the hang of it though
We stream an A film, and a B film each week.
what do you stream on?
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/funny-facebook-fails-untitled.jpg
You can just click on the #bronystate and it'll bring you back in.
so its just like a ton of fans who watch a move together and talk
I see.
Yeah, pretty much.
neat.
We stream on veemi.
http://i.imgur.com/8g299.jpg
Well, using veemi, I mean.
XD
Talking to SR, he actuall addressed me.
*Shock, awe, HORROR!
actually*
He did?! O.o
Said something like 5 lines to me.
Amazing.
holy crap
what about?
He wanted to know what the channel was about.
Besides, everyone knows that Super Metroid is the greatest video game experience ever. On consoles at least. :p
And he actually said something positive about it
[04:11] Yeah, pretty much.
Son, you best be joking.
I was not ready for that. XD
XD
Mac OS X Lion is out today
Are you denying the awesomeness of Super Metroid?
</unimportant information>
Everyone knows Battletoads is the best of all time.
Hmm...
Just kidding.
<%junh1024> http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/20/lion-ten-things-that-bug-me/ < some gripes, I think i'll stick to 10.5/6 for now
I'll give you a close second on that one.
If PC gaming is so great, why do consoles exist?
To keep all the 12 year olds out of our servers.
...
Lion is too iOS-ish
http://i.imgur.com/vSfeL.jpg Derpy in TF2
^
4Because people are too lazy to properly work servers and specs for games on PCs
>implying age is a factor to be considered
it's made by apple so isn't that expected? lol
03implying any OSX is at all acceptable
er
4And I actually am a console gamer at heart, I've just been playing on the PC a lot more recently
oic
Not a full desktop operating system >>
To keep all the dudebros our of our servers?
I've met 12 year olds much more mature, tolerable, and even intellegant than adults.
hello
FFIV is best pre-polygon, and until I play MGS, Majora's Mask is best post.
03also out of boredom: oh u
4Hello Barry
http://www.imagebam.com/image/e0ed5e139552980
It's full, but it's very different now
They may be few and far between, but it's not exactly fair to just rule them out as annoying idiots.
Majora's Mask had polygons
Hello Barry.
That's what he said.
Yes. It did.
That is SOOOOOO AWESOME
If done right, it can create more flexibility while still retaining ease of use
It's the best 3d game. I just don't like that term
If you think THAT'S awesome
wait til you see this t-shirt
http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=498
03feel free to link to that instead.
03>ad free
I thought you meant post polygons as in after they stopped using it. And MM used OoT's engine
03I could use the vps for faster speeds, too
Now question, what's your favorite game pre and post wire frames?
I'm not too bright when it comes to technology I guess.
Yeah, I 've seen it, that's the one I'm going to get. :D
:D nice!
Wire frames, i shall pick a game for that now.
Battlezone!
Until I think of something better, God of War I.
please, do. it loads in 3 seconds here.
I think SSBM was a good game that used wire frames
Oh wait, Dante's Inferno.
oh, and SL1 audio
C7!
Melee was hella good. I literally played it for hours on end.
03that's on my desktop
Never got to All Star mode though.
I'm out. It's been real.
Later
I liked Dante's Inferno.
Never bought it, but played my bro's copy.
i chaned link 2 vps
g
4I bought it
6Wut? :P
6Hey
Oh... it's him
4And also because Paradise Lost and Divine Comedy are interesting books
Hey. ---> http://www.amazon.com/Ty-Beanie-Babies-Hissy-Snake/dp/B00001QE9T/ref=pd_sim_dbs_t_1
/me 6had a sudden want to hear Fear of the Dark
I never read the poem, but I've been interested in reading The Divine Comedy.
6Slither? :P

Hissy lol, beady eyes.
I think they could have made a much better game out of the Dante's Inferno IP though.
6Aah :p
It had great potential.
4You should try reading Milton's Paradise Lost too
I don't really read books.
4And I agree, while I enjoyed Dante's Inferno, it was pretty lackluster
4Ironically, I don't really read books either and I'm a writer
If I read a book, it'll usually be a textbook.
6I like the jellyfish.. :3
4Hah, yeah, that sounds like me

I support changing the SF filter for "shit" to "sheep"
:P
I think that is an amazing idea XD
I want to change all the words to something more funny than "bleep"
I can do my best to help with that :D
lol
change the 'f' word to "pony"
"what the pony are you talking about?!"
haha
so many people would get mad at me though

Morning
ohai lol
I save pretty much all the pony pictures that I don't already have.
Though my HD derped and asploded.
So I lost all my pictures.
But meh can probably pay someone to recover everything on it.
Don't tell me it asploded from too many pony pictures
:P
Nah, it wasn't even 10% full.
Defecate?
Or maybe ill till prince gets up and sing him another song like i did last time
no, better than that
:P
And pony pictures was probably 1GB or less of 1000. X
It could still be used the same way, though.
The song i song Dairy was the real deal that shit was emotional
yeah but it'd be grosser :(
Heya manly :3
Hey, Light.
and I'd be left wondering how he got there.
or actually
now that I think about it
that pizza from the other day did taste weird.

just asking
XD awesome
Well this my take on the mods and it will be in song
hope it's not TOO distracting :P
LOL
Needs more leverage.
Well i think hipster would just be a bitch telling me my fashions old and saying she was breathing before it got old
02Manly, Shiny. Up for a hunting season? :D
02Nope, we're too busy hunting down Pokemon atm
02Well I am, Manly might get off to play lol

SirSprinkles would be the guy who got shot each day and then get tossed out a building land in in a giant pile of dog shit which would save his life and then head to a new job interview where he would once again get screwed
;o
02yay, finally got MHtri's complete ost
02the second disk was hard to find ;-;
a song on my iTunes just started playing
the writers of this band MUST be bronies

and I heard a horse whinying in the background
Lol, Ray. Youtube?
they have to be spyro related
care to participate?
02LOLno
DVD guy or or whatever i dont have a good memory would be the evil super villain made of dvds and would try to rob banks but unfortunately he would shine all the time and get caught by the cops when he tried to go into hiding
DO IT FILLY.
02320kpbs sir.

XD
okay
shit = sheep
ass = ape
fuck = flame
Off for work
02OSTs best quality. even if it's eating all of my 4GBs left of Hard Drive
Bbl
And
bitch = Sorceress
Last day too
bastard = Ripto
02:3
Lawl, I like it.

douche = Malefor
I want an argument to happen so bad with this filter!
whore = gnorc
03yo Link, as weird as it sounds, can I talk to you in private for a sec?
0254 tracks, lol
02when did MH had all of these
think that's all we have so far
02I can bet that I haven't even heard the half of it
yeah, I think so
but it's hilarious what you can say with it
you know
MH? o-o
02Monster Hunter
Flame this sheep, you all are a bunch of motherflaming Riptos!
I wonder if on OFF they aren't all crazy, saying the GOG cursewords all the time
Lawl.
maybe that's just the filter there
oh, maybe
x.x why do i keep forgetting that
If there was a track of Ludroths growling...
Troll - ????
I'd listen to it all day.
For the lulz.
troll should filter to ontels
Ghosteis would be i guess a ghost who could i dont shoot lasers from his eyes and uppercut chuck and uhh had constant diarrhea for being a ghost
02LOL, that's not that hard to find
Hahaha.
I'm gonna get going
night all
XD
02if you can find an HD rip of all the sound effects
03well
03what console?
02Wii
03OK
03I should be able to directly extract the files then
03:P
03as in, as good quality as it will eve be
03*ever
Cool people buy the game. ):
03remind me wheng I'm on my desktop though
02See, easy as 1, 2, 9001
03LOL
03Buying the game and ripping sound effects are completely unrelated.
prick = ?
03as you still need an ISO dump of it to extract the contents
Also sirsprinkles would also at night turn into the general sprinkle and lead the sprinkle army or some shit
what was the name of that sheep disguised as a robot in the original?
that should be prick
Shemp?
Wait.
...
Damn I'm stupid.
That was the sunglasses guy.
That was Toasty
02procesing the first disk
Shemp would be a good one for something though
03processing?
03well Ray if you;'ve got them as ISO files, I can just tell you how to rip the stuff yourself
03to save me quite a bit of bandwidth
02Nah, I don't have the ISO.
03oh, so first disc of what?
blarg, I should be going to bed
I didn't realize it was past midnight already
02The OST is selled in 2 disks
03OMG
03http://sale.images.woot.com/Resiste2zDetail.png <- that shirt is awesome

I'm sorry, I need to get sleep for working early
SO TASTY
weekend's close though
Silverscreen! i almost forgot
03wait what?
I'll be able to stay up all night if need be in a couple nights

03BBQ theme for what?
02MH Tri
02Also, the Agnaktors theme is awesome
03oh.
It is. <3
03thought you meant the shirt
I personally like the Gigginox's theme the best.
Even though I hate the monster.
It's just THAT PIANO.
Anyways Silverscreen would go to movies and do stuff and become the racer quick silver sometimes and race against dinosaurs and people
but for tonight at least I should be getting sleep
Ok then.
if I can't sleep I'll come back on though :P
XD
Good night
Well, possibly see you soon then.

Haha yeah
02The ceadeus (is imposible to spell it right D:) theme is also Awesome
02[2 part]
Okay well no ones here so ill just go
You spelled it right, lol.
02LOL
You should leave your computer on so we can nick alert you and keep you from sleeping
I started to dislike that theme after farming the Ceadeus, though.
XD
02D:
hmm
I could leave it on and mute it
:P
I think I will actually
Pure evil.
27 Ceadeus killed. Never have to do it again.
Unless I want another Dragongem. >_<

That reminds me.
RDX disappeared again.

03like this song I got stuck in my head which ARGH ACTUALLY MAKES ME CRY BECAUSE ASDF IT'S SO RELEVANT TO MY LIFE ;.;
Manly tears were shed?
03I had to pay like 25 bucks to import the fricking thing from Canada because iTunes was being a retarded pile as usual
03despite the site saying "Available on iTunes worldwide" it insisted on saying "Only in the Canada store" >_>

03I *do* use Zune
03I just buy songs on iTunes
03because well
03better quality audio

03because I can't even find any decent quality pirated rips
Ray, I found a 2 disc OST to Monster Hunter Tri if you need it ;p
03alright
03I'll download it overnight and see if I can extract the audio
02I already have it
03I'll just give you every audio file I can find xD
ohX D
XD*
03he wanted sound effects I think
02But I'm missing one song
Ohh
03provided they're not in some stupid format, i should be able to convert them to wav
o.o
02.mp3 plz
03Aurora
03we have that soundtrack on hoshinet
03and uh, sure, I need to convert to wav first anyway :P
gay
baisically any japanese/english pokemon album we has. in FLAC.
03except stuff I actually want
/me hides
03nah, I think I found all the stuff I needed
what you say?
03as far as Pokémon goes
03well
03I'm after instrumentals which basically don't exist so :/
like,?
03like instrumental versions of the Pokémon theme songs.
03the only actual good quality one I have is Johto Journeys from that promo disc
03I have this 1-minute runtime version of the Indigo theme some random person sent me
wait you do?
vol. 2?
03but the full length one is like horrible quality, as it came from Pokémon Music Network
03Yes.
k...
um
vol 2 is under musicftp\ost\jap\2011
one sec
k
03that would require her to have an FTP program, right:?"
so how would I go about getting it, aside from how we've usually been doing it
03I should downlaod that CD myself XD as Perfect Best collections are awesome
they are
03I have the DVds which are even more legit
http://www.mediafire.com/?zatwaxmfnfp6gqa the 2010OST in MP3
03which volume is that
V1
03well I can get the flacs myself
necisito V2
tengo V1
03practicing for spanish?
no
7hmhmhm
I don't know why I said that lol
03xD
They see me rollin
03yeah, alyssareid.com says "Check out Alyssa's new single 'The Game' available everywhere now", yeah right, iTunes says Canada only >_>
03I should email whoever manages that website and be like FIX YOUR ARTICLE|
They lovin
so
how do I get V2?
03...NOW iTunes added that album to their store
Aurora has winamp 5+/can play flac?
03>mac
^
>so?
03also why 5+?
03Winamp 2.91 plays flac...
Dey hatin da lovin
what ever happened to mp3s and such..
just curious
Cog can play FLac on Mac
03flac is lossless so it's better quality xD
03so therefore
03we don't keep lower quality versions
mp3s aren't stored on the server because >space
03if that makes sense
03yeah
k
03I suppose I can convert it for you if you want
you can downconvert flac to AAC/Mp3 using Max on Mac
But we keep on lovin
filezilla and Cyberduck and Finder are free FTP clients for mac
...
03LOL Cyberduck
03filezilla is like the best thing ever
all 3 suck on mac so i warezed transmit
03maybe it's the OS
/me hides
maybe it's the programmers
Dont hate our lovin hater!
03who make the OS
>programmers who don't write FTP clients are responsible for their suck
>mfw
03well it's OSX's fault for limiting what people can write for it.
It's not a limit
It's bad programming
I'll be back, tomorrow.
03still
The MBU made Office for mac suck
not Apple. They didn't write office. Hello?
Dont trouble yourself
03Office for mac sucks anyway
MAJOR CAUSALITY ISSUE HERE?
03then again Mac itself sucks so I mean
03that's expected
03I suppoes the only good programs are the cross-platform ones
03and those being crossplatform can als obe used on Windows so I seriously am not bothered
English lavendar.
filezilla is X-platform
it sucks on mac
03it works great on Windows and Linux, you think it's coincidental that the Mac version sucks?
Logic isn't X-platform. It's great
nope
No, it's the fault of my slow internets combined with mac neglect.
03w/e
03I kind of need to go to bed soon
CoreAudio is one of the best audio APIs/Frameworks out there.
03gonna go upstairs and downloda some crap and then go to bed, I might pop in from my desktop I suppoes
yes
It's little wonder there's no other Audio IOs for Mac.
/me faceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepalms
No
03what
For windoes, there's ASIO, MME, Dsound, etc
:o
02I'm stupid, lol. ignore plz
none is entirely satisfactory
03I just need to find something that can play that stupid UN Owen was Her MIDI without breaking >_>
Linux, there's like, 10 ones and a whole pile of mess
FL Studio?
/me RUNS
:o
03I mean, the flac you made me is fine and all but the speed's a bit off so I wanted to take a stab at it myself
03does FL Studio even play midis?
FL Studio is not a Audio IO framework.
no, but you can import MIDIs and assign instruments to them.
drf, yeah
;p
03uh
03assign instruments...?
03so it wouldn't sound um
03what's that word
03proper?
basically midi remix them
03well
03if it won't even play in Winamp/WMP/whatever
03I highly doubt it would play in FL
03just because of uber massive note overload
That's because they all use the SAME engine
it's like Firefox & Seamonkey use Gecko.
If FL have their own engine, fine, maybe
03does FL Studio use the same thing that WMP uses?
03hm
03I still need to figure out what the heck that japanese program is
03that they used to make hte video
There's also ACID, Presonus ONE, CAkewalk SONAR, and a bazillion other multitracks
03oh god ACID
03I used that back in middle school
03thing was a pain to use
DRAKE
oh?
04hi
I've found that all I need is baisically A.
03A?
and mb GB/Logic for instruments

03it actually didn't break
03in t he video you showed
03I saw an identical video where it did break xD
...
no
I wouldn't post a video that breaks
my point was that was one that played the whole thing through
03I never said you would
03right
03I just assumed it w;as the same one, as I saw one with Synthesia playing the MIDI and it started skipping
03maybe there's an updated version or something

nothing new, i typically get large midis on orchestral songs
Bees...?
Not wasps?
I love bees.
They're cute and fluffy.
i need some programs to make orchestral remixes
Unless you're alergic I see no reason for fear.
imagine, Hotel Mario's theme Orchestrated XD
I got stung by a swarm of bees 13 times when I went camping once
Hate them all now
I've never felt pain like that

Do you just not like average sized spiders?
Or do you dislike tarantulas too?
They're so fluffy.
I hate all spiders
Ah.
They were huge and black
The bees
and buzzed very loud
We encountered them In a sandy area by a lake
Completely black?
I expect there's black bees, I've seen red wasps before.
Yeah frk
From my memory
I recall them being really dark
And very loud
red wasps are terrifying
just seem more dangerous when red.
XD
Idk if horse flies chase tho
I suppose it sort of looks like a warning if red.
Those bees chased us a good quarter mile
It went in my shoes my back
._.
Oh, was bees then.
They were trying to kill us I swear
Flies don't chase you, bees do.
You probably walked near a hive without noticing it.
There's these like, wasps or bees or something in our yard
Maybe
They like live in the ground
But it was a public trail
Like WTF don't they check for that?
Lol
Well they could have set up their hive there recently.
It's a pretty busy camp area though
I'm thinking maybe the red wasp I saw was a hornet.
Because it was massive.
Bees in my area aren't that bad though
Oh
It would suck living in Australia
XD
All the big spiders live there
I would die I swear lol
I remember seeing that the wasps in Japan are the worst though.
The only thing I like about spiders is that they eat flies
I hate flies.
Not scared, just find them annoying
They get hornets that are 2 inches long.
And they're common.
._.
They can keep them :3
Maybe you'd like them though.
"The hornets can devastate a colony of honey bees: a single hornet can kill as many as 40 honey bees per minute thanks to its large mandibles which can quickly strike and decapitate a bee"
Lol
"It takes only a few of these hornets a few hours to exterminate the population of a 30,000-member hive, leaving a trail of severed insect heads and limbs"
And then we brought in bears to take care of the hornets
LOL
I have hornet spray
Bears to deal with hornets known as the "yak-killer".
;o
Bears get chased away by normal wasps/bees. :P
There's a wild bear on the loose in my area
Then we bring in nukes.
XD
Hahaha.
"Our city is overrun with hornets!" - NUKE THE CITY.
Damn.
With combustable lemons
That's one big hornet.

I would suicide I swear lol
A spider that's bigger than your face. :P
Oh god
I can't believe people have like pet tarantulas
That's crazy
Tarantulas are fuzzy though. :>
What if it escapes o.o
Scary
My uncle had one
It escaped and no one found it until one day my uncle was in the bathroom.
Wow, the bird-eater lives 15-25 years.
Impressive.
And... yeah.

You'll regret it.
They're harmless though.
Own like fish
Something that'll die if it tries to escape.
They aren't harmless
Well nemo escaped
Tarantulas can shoot out those fuzzy hairs
But that was Hax
usually harmless, but if you breath it in you'll be fucked up
Nemo Irl would have died
Just sayin'
I heard like
Your only supposed to own female tarantulas
I wonder if the like to be stroked.
Cuz the males are shredding
they*

I fixed the bug that made her respond even when frozen if you used an unknown command.
It never listens to me :(

what's the point of an anonymising script if it's only for a single client anyway? :P
and by revealing the script version, one could check what mirc versions the script is compatible with, thus making an educated guess..

heya
Don't CTCP Version me
Also
Lakorv: Minnet is displaying only the first version reply received, the mirc version came in a second reply ;p
Cube grab my keyboard.
...
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAM!!!
and Minnet is set to only accept one message (but does take multiple lines if they're properly encoded) because of security stuff.
Else you could emulate replies to make her say just about anything.
simulate, even.
During an early development stage, I had a friend of me do that just to see how vulnerable it was.
the reply comming later at least makes more sense than if it had tried to anonymise it's self ;p
nothing major but potentially compromising as you could feed any text into her and have her output it.
though, mirc should be sending it's version reply first, because that's apparently hardcoded
true :p
scripts come later
Minnet: version Lakorv

Not sure ex, google around to check
compmgmt.msc, secpol.msc, etc
Hmmm
I found one
whee.
poor minnet ;p
But it royally messed up system files and was only in x86
And I'm on x64
>>
as is often the case with stuff in active development ;p
Minnet: help
Excuse me?
Minnet: commands
Excuse me?
/me excuses Minnet
because that's what happened on one of my friend's networks after someone managed to get an oper's password
she doesn't have a help function yet, actually
if you know what you are doing
it is possible
I rewrote her command recognition, so a help function is in the TODO.
if you have raw command access, you can do almost anything you want
connect ghost servers, introduce 50k fake users, fake userhosts to control any nick/ident/host based bots, etc
and I see @ Lakorv, much the same for me too when coding ;p
command lists tend to be low on the list of needs until late on in development
yeah, I know that much at least...just never realised the SRA thing though
Services administrator, you mean?
Minnet: reload the database functions
Lakorv: I reloaded db.lua.
Lakorv: I know what you mean, I've coded two bots in C++, one was terrible, the second slightly less so ;p
live insertion :>
let's see now.
live code things are fun, I modified a friends PHP bot, it's so nice to be able to run raw code or include/add a new command/user without restarting ;p
very difficult to easilly get anything near that flexibility with c++ as you know
interpreted languages like lua and such are good for that
Yeah
I use sql for the user database
/me sneezes
thoroughly secured and escaped, of course.
passwords are stored only as hashes, obviously.
/me nods
sql adds a bit of consideration for things like escaping stuff
eh?
I mean services root administrator
you need that in the first place to access OS raw ;p
bit of a chicken and the egg there methinks
Minnet: how long have you been online?
what is this I don't even.
well, that's not true with the newer versions of anope...1.8.x requires SRA to use a lot of the commands, including raw
Minnet: set the output level to debug

I should give her a wider vocab.

no, because you're not added.
trying to exploit the versioning function already? :p

Sorry, but I couldn't understand that reply.. You sure it conforms to the RFC?
Minnet: reload your commands again.
Lakorv: I reloaded the command files.
I approve of this reply screening ;p
and you hit my default fallback in case of unsafe version replies :p
Ahem.
I wonder what classifies as safe, I be curious
anything understandable for my string.match() patterns :p
also
not * NICK [current nick]
And they weren't in the config
was one added there that should not have been?
I had to restore backups to fix it
there were about 5 added
it was weird
because afaik SRAs are done from the config not the dbs
No idea, either an exploit, or using some internal undocumented commands
which only ulines can access
local reply = l:match("VERSION%s*(.-)%\001")
I see ;p
Yeah, I figured that, oh well
hmm, it was the carridge return I included
better luck next time :p

Sorry, but I couldn't understand that reply.. You sure it conforms to the RFC?
she's running on a linux system by the way, if relevant.
Alright, I think it's safe enough ;p
and I see, is the actual text of the ctcp reply displayed in the console? ;p
no. :>
only this
/me nods
there's some fun things one can do for text directly displayed to the console that users can manipulate
I know.
she's slightly vulnerable for that
but then you need to know what's displayed and what not :p
I should probably fix that though.
updated the git repo a lil' by the way
didn't push earlier.
Minnet: reload your commands
Lakorv: I reloaded the command files.
Minnet: reload your functions
Lakorv: I reloaded funcs.lua.

Minnet: reload funcs.lua
Lakorv: I reloaded funcs.lua.
Minnet: some weird unknown comm14and0 stuff.
Excuse me?
Minnet: reload functions.
Lakorv: I reloaded funcs.lua.
okay, so she doesn't handle colours in the middle of a line any well
but people who use that may as well go die
so it's their fault for not being able to use her properly.
I see ;p
/me may be distracted at work now and then</info>
colours leave digits amidst the characters, which will confuse her.
I've implemented support for completely coloured lines, but not partially coloured ones.
One of my favourites is something like str_repeat($chr(8),100) $+ 2011-07-21/16:11:51 : DEBUG Error returned from SQL Server: Internal fire detected in database
As an example, to cause the bot owner to have a moment of confusion
character 8 usually deletes the previous character before it in the console
:p
so you get a whole line to yourself
have fun
would be nice if you could find a vulnerability or two so I could get rid of them.
I unfortunatley don't know her console layout, but I've done it with my friends PHP bot a few times, and had a good chuckle
hehe
giving fake errors on the simplest of commands, etc
I don't think you can manage to make her run your own code though
I've tried avoiding that
but go ahead, it'd be fun :p
and the layout is, she prints stuff stupidly through print(), without regard for terminal size or anything.
likely not, as long as you have been careful where the content of text may be included in a variable that gets dereferenced perhaps once too many times
there's likely few places that can happen
mhm.
Minnet: reload your functions
Lakorv: I reloaded funcs.lua.
14Minnet: say hi.
Hi.
okay, still works.
it's nice to be able to reload parts like that ;p
yeah, I like it :p
and as a safer alternative to running code directly given to her
you can instead use a designated file, and then reload it.
so only the admin can hotload improvised code.
one command I find useful, is something called sraw, which feeds everything after the command as if it were a line of text from the server
hm
what do you use it for?
useful for debugging/testing situations that may be difficult to try replicate on the server
/me puts an example together
ah, yeah.
Excuse me?
and so on, if testing her user database of channel users, and such
mhm.
you just reminded me of an unrelated function..
Minnet: Hello
Excuse me?
/me chuckles
she thinks it's a command :<
Minnet is forgetful
Hello, Minnet.

Good afternoon, Lakorv.
Minnet: what is the time?

Seems to work now ;p
yup.

Yes, I have a little too much free time at work today~
I see nothing :o
Minnet: set output level to debug
Lakorv: Done.
try again?
mirc may have capitalisiedified it
at normal output levels she doesn't bother with unknown commands and the like. She's on debug now though, give it a try.
Hmm, did try ;p
still nothing~
what'cha doing? :p
Interesting, let me try something a little less invalid

> Apple, the first major os to encourage widespread, secure sandboxing
oh wait
that won't work
lol sandbox
well, > OS X, but still.
I mean, yeah, App Stores are a great way to discover apps, and environmentally-friendlier as well (no boxes and stuff)
But this?
lolwut
EW APP STORES
>piracy
OS X lion looks more retarded than snow leopard does
>no boxes
Making it the ONLY way won't work bud
but come on
I'm hoping it's not designed to be server software
I was really, SERIOUSLY thinking of getting a Mac next year
Now, I'm definitely sticking to PC.
for all the bloody love and hate in the world
/me hides
people who run their SERVERS on macs
/me facepalms
OSX is Unix based, so it's better than *cough* using Windows *cough* for servers.
that's true
I beg to differ
Windows Server actually works
but still
if you're going to get a unix-based server
But Mac OS X = not server, except for their server editions
at least use linux or freebsd or something
Yeah
Unless all you serve is podcasts and such
This guy runs a bloody website on his mac at home
Hmmm?!
all OS X releases can be turned into servers.
just like any Posix OS
because they're Posix/Unix.
Pos OS?
yeah that sounds right
Posix is a standard.
or a set of standards, rather.
Even Windows has a bit of Unix baked in, no?
windows != unix
I think some tcip stuff was taken from Unix, yes
well, there are obviously /some/ elements
but it's mainly DOS and NT - that is, in-house dev.
but the overall design and core is DOS and N-
yeah
You know Microsoft quite heavily based at least a few concepts on Unix
oh, concepts, truly
but actual code, not so much.
Indeed
Everything's out there is now Unix or NT
NT ftw
unix > NT
for servers maybe
for actually doing stuff, nah
Mostly for servers
But unless you need a super high-end workstation, I feel Windows is fine
^
windows for a workstation is actually decent
my VPS is Windows, works like a charm
but windows is best for personal use
and gaming
Heh, yeah
AIM for Android, y u no work
Windows sucks when it comes to multiple users
Windows doesn't give me enough control. I prefer full access to the OS and modding possibilities.
That hulking registry
>admin account
And the fact that Group Policy Editor isn't available on Home editions
who the f*** uses home editions
<Lakorv> Windows doesn't give me enough control. I prefer full access to the OS and modding possibilities.
Yeah, but for simple use, it's fine
For some people it can be too much
02*WB03(Aurora03)02WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
