02You must tell the story of this uneducated person, I'm really curious
12Well, it takes patience to draw anything good
/me sits down with pizza
03or you can just draw a normal picture and downscale it to 100x100
12That would not look right
02lmao

6On the sprite I'm working on now.

6Lol.
6Well, how good my sprites are fluctuates.
/me curls up on Feather's head

07http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OxWD85Ngz4&feature=topvideos_mp
07at least it isn't horribly autotuned lol
6It's actually decent.
6Note the like/dislike ratio.
03these guys are admitting to smoking pot
03on the show
03and someone admitted to breaking a law
03I'd be like GTFo, both of you
07Alright
07lol
07I'm off for foods
07she was
03was?
07but nothing on the show is legally binding
03wait
03really?
07yup
07when someone on there sues someone else
03then why do they say "real cases, real people, the decisions are final" etc
07both sides make money
07lol
07it's arbitration
03hm
03I didn't know that XD
03either way
03she dismisses cases all the time, if someone comes in there and talks about being a drug addict, I'd dismiss it right then and there
03where's the money come from o.o
07the tv studio lol
03people get paid to be on the show?
07yup
03dude, someone sue me please
/me runs
07it's in the credits XD
03hm, I'll pay close attention then
10Sorry, I'm trying to think of something XD
10got a lot going on at once
6Okay.
/me draws on Feather's head
6I have 30 minutes.
02My masterpiece
/me draws on Feather's head as well
12XD
6Eh?
10Ness dressed in Scout's outfit :D
6ovO
6As a sprite?
6Hmm...
6So was my precognizance correct?
06<%Feather> Ness dressed in Scout's outfit :D
06Yes.
10http://quanyails.deviantart.com/art/GENTLEMEN-195919939 <-- I like the style you used in this picture, but if a sprite would be easier then I'm okay with that :>
06It make sense. If Ness is the one with the bat.
6D:
6WHY SHOW THAT? DDDDDDDDDDDDDD:
10THAT PIC IS AWESOME D:
06Surprise
6Is not. :<
6My mental perception's changed due to Liquidsilk's idea.
6But anyway, drawing cartoonishly...
6I guess I could... X.x
10more than half my gallery I can't even look at anymore lol
10so I know how you feel
10but really
6So you want Ness as relatively normal?
6Not like SSBB?
10YES, I hate SSBB's style XD
6Okay.
6So, wait:
/me 6checks Ness's design.
/me stalks
6How would you tell that was Ness?
6He's not very distinctive. :P
03but that's interesting
03and makes sense
6Doesn't he also voice Cosmo?
03I'm not sure
03does he?
03I'm watching that live action movie, it's on Nick right now
/me 6notes that.
10XD
06>Normal Hat
6Oookay.
06>TF2
06what are you smoking
/me dies
10wut?
10XD
06x3
6You noticed on the deviation how long it took to draw that with MS Paint?
6Now, drawing an entire figure...
10Oh, you don't HAVE to draw his whole body
10was just noting incase you did
6Ah.
6Eh...
10I definitely don't want to ask too much from you
6Scout's hat?
10Guess I can just go with that
6All right.
10and you want Suiguno?
6Hrm.
6Well, can you draw old-ish people?
6Or two people? :P
10when I do it always ends up cute and young looking lol
10I can do two people
6Eh...
6This idea came up in my mind because of voice actors:
03why the frick are they making a Glee 3D movie >_>
obscure Japanese characters ftw?

03still watching
06more like "lol ok arresting all of you until further investigation"
06or well, keep them in custody or whatever it's called
03still, they couldn't definitively charge one person if all 3 claim to have done it
03since this was back in the 80s
06xD
06fair enough
03well, could abeen early 90s
03I think the show went from like 1982 to early 2000s, but this is clearly an older episode given the quality of it
03yeah this is obviusly before GPS
03as two of the 3 witnesses were cops
03and they had no way of veri3fying if they were really there

AVENGE HARRY AND RANDOM!
9>Implying the voice acting isn't GLORIOUS
why does gillian sometimes have blue and sometimes brown eyes?
weird
thank u
^_^
Or possibly building up to a Snatcher-related twist
4@PizzaPony: I still have my copy of MGS for the PS1
I was wondering if he was a snatcher...
8http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/6271771/images/1255557317139.png
4@PizzaPony: Yes, it's possible. I know, it seems unfathomable
3rd person, with the ability to do 1st person scoping
Not the first one
Take the poster.
and yeah i hate twin snakes
snake goes all neo
It's possible to have never played MGS let alone not own it.
psg1 stinger and twin snakes? ...Weapons?
there is just something about snakes polygon head in mgs
huh...
4Bah, MSG
and he shouldn't be there
4MGS
PSG1 and Stinger are weaons, Twin Snakes is a remake for the gamecube of MGS
9Mobile Suit Gundam?
OH FUCK BLOOD
BLOOOOOD
4Twin Snakes was a much more action oriented version of MGS; much flashier, too
THE ROOOOOOF
6How are you? :P
oshit
Should I just go tackle the first one?
WAT
O SHI
The fuck?
OH SNAP
SPIDERMAN IS A SNATCHER
4The fuck was Kano doing up there...?
IN EVERY CONTINUITY OF HIS SERIES
No one ever looks on the roof!

Wigglesworth is a snatcher.
Use the UV light! Find out that other people hit on other people too... much more successfully
wasn't there blood under the chair in the detective's room?
good
hehehe
yourself?
or at least I saw some there
4Confession time!
The devs of this said they blatantly ripped off Terminator and Blade Runner when they made this
there!
DesSur: they said explicitly they ripped em off
Agreed, PizzaPony
I CALLED IT!
_Dermathil: ...and a good one too.
4It's bad enough to think I'm a SNATCHER, ...but "cutest snatcher?"
DesSur: I never said otherwise
we need snatcher pony fanart now.
He got his 'Story Mark' as a pair of gloves and handcuffs
fund it!

03but listen to how horrid that quality is
03it has TWO rap verses instead of one
03granted, the no rap version is the best
03but I want to make a longish edit with all the words XD
No rap is good at all ;pp
12to drf
12a song has to be FLAC or higher
10Eminem is good
^
hes fine
03not to mention
I hate rap
03this song isn't a rap song at all
can't stand it in the least
03it just has a rap verse
03and heck
03it makes them good XD

9I'll just leave this here
03but like I said
03a lot of those songs had rap verses
03rap verses in songs != rap songs
03sigh
03I hate impossible to find songs x.x
03LOL
03I mean I hate the fact that they're impossible to find.
03that being said I enjoy a challenge, I've found about four "non existant" songs now
12XD
12I.O.N is impossible to find
03well
03there was one song
03that my friend heard on the radio back in like 1995
03but only radio stations had it
03and there was no record at all that it even existed
03they called it the "Alternate radio edit"
02Uploaded
Lol.
03the normal one has a n-word in it, the radio edit doesn't, but that one never really surfaced anywhere
12sigh
12i want to get used to keyboard and mouse for TF2
12*bizarre
03I hate using keyboard and mouse for games
03hence why I play on the xbox
12you do know TF2 can be adjusted to use a controller right?
except drf hates TF2
I use a wireless PS2- ripoff controller XD
It's the best thing
12i use a 360 controller by default
Hmm, I think keyboard and mouse are nice to play with. Doesn't make much difference though.

12dunno if it's all over the place there
12but here it's literally like every 2 blocks
theres 2 Kwik trips here
12ahh

12you never seem to understand how great a kwik trip is until you leave the state and have to deal with other gas stations
12rocky rococo is the same case

Minnet: how are you?
Excuse me?
Minnet: hug?
Excuse me?
also
g'morrow, Minnet
Good evening, Staeld.
she should recognise some slang/dialect as well as proper wordings.
it's not exactly beautiful coding, but it works somehow
Minnet: errow, Minnet
Excuse me?
skip the first mention :p
errow, Minnet
I didn't know that wording though. Should I add it? :p
06yup :3
Minnet: unload dump
Excuse me?
hm
06mmhmm
The character used to signify colour?
I get that as $chr(3) in mIRC.
Minnet: reload hacks
..nice.
gah.
also I'll add 'herrow' :p
06og, good :3
okay, now to add the colour

and prevent Armads from typing.
03LOL
03we were using uh
03sulfuric acid
02No, it's on Manly's doublememe. He uploaded it to his profile and she commented there
6Ah.
03that and sodium hydroxide (strong base)
lol
6What's she saying now?
fun
!!
03XD
02She took the whole meme seriously
03Yeah but my lab partner was a complete idiot
I don't think capsaicin is actually dangerous
but that doesn't stop it from hurting like a mofo.
oo
Link?
6Literally...
it sucked.
02http://flashmagnanimous.deviantart.com/art/Double-Meme-With-Shiny-243643719
02Yeah?
6Oooh.
I had done this many times in the past but with no repercussions
03ah
agreed, SL
03for some reason if I eat too many sour candies my tongue getls compoletely burned from it
03-l
6Are you talking about citric acid?
6@DRF.
but I failed to realize that while handling the peppers, you're supposed to wear gloves.
03OK
03yeah, it totally burns
03like literally
03if you eat too much
if I disconnect soon, brb xD
I don't really eat sour candies anymore because of it.
03same
03sometimes I'll wipe the sugar off
03maybe like 1/3 that amount would be enough XD
'cause they're superior anyway
:d
03true
03I like Sour Patch Kids though
sour patch kids are aight
Like toxic waste sweets.
03but some of those have waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much citric acid on them
but just like anything, the overuse of the sugar can kills 'em lol
03yeah
03heck
03I used to eat those candies in school, right
03and my teachers would get mad that I'd spill the sugar all over the place
03I'm like "it's not my fault there's half a pound of it loose in the bag..."
I'd just eat Swedish Fish 'cause lol no random crap in it
03YAY SWEDISH FISH
:D
6I guess...
03so I resorted to sour patch kids XD

6Should Haii treat criticism as a joke?
03I actually thought she swore for a second.
No, she shouldn't
oo
03god, these cases make me sick to the stomach
03when someone sues someone else for hurting their pets
02She doesn't already?
03EW ANIMAL ABUSE
02I mean, not in a joking kind of sense, but she doesn't take that seriously
6But now she'll have an excuse not to.
6That is, if she follows that.
02And I believe I worded it to saying she shouldn't take things that are for laughs too seriously
6Assuming she follows that logic.
03why are we still talking about haii
because she's gett
that
6I'm mildly curious that she hadn't responded to that Lugiram sprite.

Oo 80 and 40 GB hard disks
lol
And whut
My computers only have one hard drive each, and I don't think they can support more.
prebuilt by manufacturers, etc
I have a spacy desktop tower.
laptop is just a single hdd though.
Till then I have two laptops and no cash. lol
that said, my desktop is self-built and old.
it's got an Opteron 185 and a GeForce 7300 LE.. say no more.
amazing how those little thin disks were used less than 10 years ago
150GB
I've a 250 and a 40 GB drive in the desktop.
I keep most of my crap on externals now.
12Back
games, backups, more games etc
My laptop is encrypted, and my sd card is the key~
lol, that's cool :o
My wireless is encrypted and I'm the key.
lol
to log on without the sd card
WOW MANLY
mac filtering is cool.
you need four passwords.
with it, you only need three.
12Hey Manlyguy
Wb, GL
12xD
03LOL encryption
03that's completely pointless on a laptrop
do you even know the fourth one? :P
03*laptop
/me pets GL to make sure he's ok
03plain and simple
03because it is
LOL arguing about encryption on a laptop
that's the point, silly
that's why you encrypt
because you need the password to decrypt them.
03I prefer to just not have anything of value on there.
not the os, but the files.
and this is my school laptop, things /will/ be on it.
I keep most things of value on my externals.
external(s)
03oh no somebody found a paper you wrote
/me hides
02I figured when I saw talk about laptops
somebody said that
03XD
03besides when it's at my house, at least
encryption adds on to passwords though.
encryption for file security
03well
/me decides if he wants to add to the debate or not
03it's more of a hassle
passwords for os access.
03I prefer just hitting power and having access to my computer.
03rather than having to type in a password which is completely stupid anyway
03at least on Windowsa
03-a
03because you can easily just delete the password
/me yaaawns
03*laptops
03but yeah
02lol
03I have my laptop set to completely unencrypted, no password, turn it on and it logs in type thing
03I can see using it on a desktop but...
Armads must now depart for a place of interest
02Manly I have 3 free slots
later peeps
02What should I do with them?
02xD
I get longer battery time, working hotkeys and such things.
03LOL
03that and it somehow heating wup more than it should
03-w
brb
023 Armor Slots xD
...FreeBSD and OpenSolaris on the other hand...
read my line again; must be a weird thing if it heats based on os.
Well, to put it lightly, Debian made me want to sledgehammer the laptop. FBSD and OSOL work magnificantly. (Also, they have less "04HATE" moments.)
02Wheee
Except for OSOL, that just doesn't like my wi-fi. :/
02I do too
02hi?
That might be a problem with a monster like the Jhen.
02yeep It'll

12k, well in that case I’m all fine with you having that nick registered. But to prevent confusion, just try not using it.
06^!
12You don't need my permission. It's about not confusing me
06I dont use it, and it was still in my group :(
6when was the last time it was used?
6they automatically get dropped after a couple months
12Na, I tested it in another channel, it’s still registered
6...

Ahh crap. No passport.

Oh well. I can always swim across the the river in Erie.
This is CGI
not gameplay.
6You need to add FlutterPeanut to the exceptions.
Oh yeah,
I knew I was going to forget someone.
6I had to count them all.

6Everypony else was a no.

SHIT GRAPHICS
6He did, but there were server problems and he disappeared during them.
11understood.
11ah, I see.
My computer is good.
J/k
I run Crysis 2 on highest settings. Maybe it could run Crysis 1, I don't have it.
6As am I.
Crysis 1 is much more graphics intensive than Crysis 2.
I know.
6I do want to see how he'll do and decide then though.
Crysis 2 is a console port.
That's why I said maybe it could run C1, but I don't have it.
I KNOW
I just have generations 1 and 2 on

it shaked too much right and left
when running
It defies the laws of physics when it flies.
11Pistols are easiest used with the stupid crosshairs rather than the manual aim.
yeah, the aiming is also abysmally bad
11Did we interview isoscoles?
6I honestly don't know.
I don't think it is with mods
11...um....why is DashAttack's mail get sent to the spam folder? XD

6Guys, I'm going to email DesSur about the advert on his show. Cool with everypony?
I get thunderstorms and COLD winters.
/me 7mirror-flips the image and continues edits.
11One of my workers got heat stroke today.
11my mom's workers*
I'd prefer cold weather too.
-30degrees celcius
11advert?
in winter
6He does little 10 second adverts during his show.
+30degrees celsius in summer
6No.
11???
6Magical Pony Theater 3000
although it's more cold generally
Eh
11o.o
6He came to us.
11OH! I know now.
6It has only a few followers.
11no shit.
This winter was really cold. First time I ever experience negative Fahrenheit temps. (I haven't lived in PA all of my life).
NIttany: The thunderstorms form around 6PM because of the heat and humidity that prevents the clouds from forming or something.
6?
You mean a capping inversion?
11Another stream came to us. That's awesome.
6Eyup.
What's that?
It's when air temps rise with height.
Maybe its that, I dunno
6But they have been plugging us consistently.
11Really? Awesome.
Usually, temps do the opposite with height.
It's probably what's happening.
STRANGE, I remember looting multiple shotguns from that first fight.
shotties and SMGs
Bulletproof dogs? Why haven't I played this?
they are pretty shitty anyway
If you go from no clouds to "Suddenly, thunderclouds.", you've had a cap break.
Sadly, this is as far as I've ever gotten. I need to go back to this.
(Yeah I read the hints and tricks before starting to play. Didn't serve me anything
6They don't really have much in mind, just that they would like to partner. I haven't really talked much business with them.
6Yes.
6Briefly.
6We have a lot of followers on it.
but with mods I endured it
and NPCs do die to anomalies
mind linking me to a mod that fixes the FRICKING AIMING PROBLEM? Oh, and one that permits autosaving every five minutes?
11I have five minutes.
11:|
I used some modpack
which fixed and improved a LOT
that fixed the shitty aiming?
LINK PLEASEE!!!
I don't know
the aiming is always shitty as far as I remember
the aiming can't be fixed?
the aiming down sight that's as imprecise as hipfiring
I think it was this: http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-complete-2009
11That's in the middle of the week, though.
6Is it?
6It's the weekend.
11...
11I'm on July. x.x
6XD
oh, the inaccurate aiming is probably just bad weapons at the beginning
11Yeah, that weekend would work. XD
6Yeah, we decided one movie, followed by two eps each night.
6That way we still have a reason for the lotto the previous week.
6A total of 6 picked eps.
11I'll make sure not to schedule anything then.
11Sounds good to me.
I meant the aiming that was mentioned in the reviews and such
6Alright. Later.
6Good to get you caught up.
meh, I don't know, don't read reviews
11See you all later.
11*aparates*
It's a fantastic mod.
6*has been slacking off on the email account*
6*has been busy with the actual site*
(That last thing could've been caused by the alcohol's effects ingame though)
mhm, it's the only thing that made me play it again
That guys gonna cut his finger if he keeps doing that.
I never went beyond that checkpoint under the trainbridge
the "dungeons" are really good
basically everything that is underground
I hope, since I'm gonna try that thing again with that mod.
9and mods later
nah
it doesn't matter really
yup
you gotta get on top of this building's roof I think.
Hello

there should be a hole in the roof somewhere with a chest in it
not necessarily that one
one of the corners I think
hi
look in that hole in the roof's corner?
there?
(unless I'm mistaken and all of that is for nothing)
how's it going?
alright
7I made my adjustments.
7:P*
10okay XD
THERE IT IS
Oh nice, does it feel good to hjave that out of the way?
What's all this for?
but how do you grab it?
yeah
a suit

she was one of the most annoying bosses on our first playthrough
wow
we died the first time when it was just me and Jenna
then we prepared more
now sell it to see Dermathil's reaction :P
I won't care, its alot of money

MAYYYYYYYYYYYYBE
No, he just thinks that you are are crazy.
7Jellicent can learn Energy Ball. :P

Yeah
Well hello there...
wtf is that
Jellicent
/me thumbs up :3
is it a good item?
neat for the beginning
but it won't help for too long
yeah, It is something I found in a hints and trick section somewhere. Still surprised I remember it after a year
7Jellicent is a jellyfish. :P
no
SMG all the way
nah

And then female.
Tales of Symphonia
Oh.
I never used shotguns
a hidden gem
console
6you devolved
it's for the gamecube and PS2, but I think only the gamecube version got ported outside Japan
Hmm.
yeah maybe
6blasphemy
but more weapons = more weight
I also remember having shot at the militaries at the beginning to lead them to the starting point
1. Go to http://lockfale.com/

the konami code thing
XD
I've done this before
it's pretty cool
vodka helps you agaist radiation?
Vodka? What's that do?
8>vodka makes you immune to radiation
ba? O_o -b* XD
lowers radiation
xD
if i remember right
8AWWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHH
yeah, i remembered getting motion sickness because I had too much radiation and drank enough vodka to turn it back to zero
Are you shitting me.
Note to self: Buy more vodka
more like you don't care about the radiation anymore
Yes, I am shitting you
I am not _DErmathil

Never got through that cordon
4What is our resident streamer streaming this night?
SR turned up in the movie night stream channel when there were over 200 people.
I think he was wondering WTH was going on.
6D:
4Looks interesting
Yeah.
DAMN YOU!
vodka games
Yes
yeah
I TYPED THE WHOLE NAME
:O
yup
Elky: Chernobyl is way north
I switched it over to this network at least temporarily because of all the netsplits on the one we were on.
I wasn't paying attention. :/
But looks horrible
well it's chernobyl surrounding
called the zone
sound fair?
helicopter? wut?
and the protagonist can't get out?
Haha
the protagonist doesn't want to get out
military quarantined the whole area
6..
/me lol'd
there were 200 people in a channel on this network?
WUT
o.o
6um
6ok....I guess I wont joke around with you then
Yeah.
6I've never known anyone to take the word "blasphemy" seriously
I heard of that... I think. But where?
6which...i guess is ironic
6anyways
6sorry, I didn't think you'd take that seriously
WUT
6I was saying blasphemy about you changing from chikorita to squirtle
TUW
oh
and then the stream was killing floor
6yeah
lots of shortcut icons
I think I heard of it because of ponies...
lol
yes
go for it, derma :p
Yes, a very bad person. :P
wow
Someone needs to clean up their desktop.
implying anyone uses their desktops
Be a CREDIT TO TEAM and play TF2!
9I am the lazy
There are 17 people still around, watching someone stream killing floor or something.
TF2!!!!
I WANNA SNIPE SOME MOAR
17 is still a lot for this network though
I don't use my desktop at all. Desktop has no icons.
XD
lol, I've actually been considering going back to TF2
it's more than #epic-chat
9'cept I suck at TF2
though I'll have to learn all of the rediculous items they made
CRY SUM MOAR!
Lol. XD
9at least in Floor of Killing I am somewhat decent
haha, but then we can laugh at you!
I don't have KF
this network is kind of pathetically tiny, isn't it?
XD
9I'm not "so bad it's good"
I haven't gotten a single item in TF2 for a while
Me neither. :(
9I'm "so bad it's horrible"
02!pokemon
awww
Yeah, I suppose.
we still <3 despite being a noob :P
I hadn't realised until recently.
Fits perfectly, imo.
When I /list and see there's something like 20 different people on the network.
6banettes are cool lol
6but their pokedex entry is trippy
9KILLING FLOOR
9Y U NO BOOT
me neither
Same here
the stream is getting experimental...
02If you want a trippy Pokedex
02Look at Darumaka's
I played it during a free weekend once.
Mine won't tell me that
6lol walmart suckls for one thing
evil clown!
02Oh wait no that's for laughs
Clown.
6shiny, yamask, end of story
Killing Floor is pretty neat
It only lists all the channels and how many people are in them
especially if you play it with bros
no
brb
A wut?
6yeah well
DOSH?
6in this case
6it sucks
k
DOSH.
DOSH?
6you don't go to walmart for fabric
There were no other fabric stores around where I live
DOSH?
*are
EXPLAIN!
it's all about the DOSH
or don't
6since when does walmart even sell fabric?
02lol wow
I can work with that explanatiob
Does that count?
sure :P
02But for laughs, I'm still going with Darumaka
Derp is on.
It's been there, there isn't much to pick from, but it is there
6there are a lot of fabric stores online that sell for fairly cheap
Blitzcrank!
If you aren't full I can join
Only for the dlc
9no Elky, it's fightan zombies
9Soarin
though I barely played it
9yeah
issue there is you have to pay shipping
02Aw bull no One Piece this week
Why is there a boiler-mech at a carnival?
okey dokey
9just for the seasonal event
circus zombies
why not?
9BECAUSE
EUROPE
spartan head!
NORTH AMERICA
9quality's pretty bad though
9let me fix that
DEM ARMS
DEM HANDS!
At least, I think they were hands.
02My kitten keeps trying to sit in the windowsill when it's not open
02:|
hands are too mainstream
6because unfortunately, plush making in itself is fairly expensive
I use hooks.
I use claws
Am I the only one that still has hands?!
is that that movie channel you're talking about?
>friend request sent
I only use custom imported paperclip constructions
6for an entire plush?
I have hands, their just not attached
It wasn't a complicated one
6I know but still
6fabric runs usually at $5-$7 a yard
Nah, that's our mod channel.
Which you can't get into anyway.
*is
It's just #bronystate
Damn hooks
6but that's also for really cheap fabric
9there we go
9fixed
tbh, I don't see much of a diference
not that it looks bad
6it's the cheapest for being still decent quality
it just was okay before too
You're able to buy less than a yard though, right?
6yeah
9look at the letters
9much less fuzzy
hm
now I need a third monitor
9I only have one
9and I deal w/it
if I wanted one I would have to comission one or settle for something
I can't sew
Streaming porn.
for constant pony episodes?
oh, that works too
Sewing isn't too bad. I sucked at it until I went to a convention and had to practice
Aha! I found it! http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/28316
That would have bugged me all night.
I'll look for that type of fabric though. I'd rather not order online unless I decide to commit, it's getting to the stores that is the problem
I hear you...
split up!
That always works in the movies!
It
It's more like COD zombies.
Dat recoil

Except with different types of zombies.
20 minutes remaining of waiting for the DL to finish
if it was a Togepi I would have gone for it
Machete. Coolest Melee, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
Those things are always rigged
they are
that is why I passed it up
not worth the effort

dude me too
I was just making a joke. :P
lol I know :p
someone claimed Eminem named his {censored} Hailie and I'm sitting here thinking "...wtf? that's his daughter you idiot"
XD
maybe he named his daughter after it
ya never know with celebrities.
LOL
always doin weird crap.
lol
he was trying to prove why Eminem is "bad for society"
and mixing facts up
rofl
he said Eminem made the song Hot In Herre
Pwned
I was like, no.
but for different reasons
yeah, y u use n-word

7Is dA borking for anyone else?
12somehow i read that as drf-bad
6nope
03i
Atmosphere - ruined. XD
:P
7Hrm.
implying dA ever worked
12SilverSonic i'm surprised
I don't remember the last time that site loaded in under 30 seconds
7Hrm.
7Eh, I can't put a comment on the site.
dA is one large trollfest
6well let us do as we please
drf
6some of us enjoy it
http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/060/2/5/trollface_ftw_by_6661_apocalyptik-d3apyms.png
did I ever once say you can't do it?
and Armads, would rather not break my phone right now
/me runs
6you're making it-
6what quan said
which I suppose, I should be glad people actually listen to my rants :)
7Eh, I'll deal with you later, DRF.
12wb'
7Well, not me.
'deal with'?
6or inferring such
7Indeed.
6it's somewhat insulting, degrading, etc
Watch out.
XD
that's fair.
6...
7You can disagree, but not persuade.
6what did /I/ say
9we're live
I'm not persuading
I just said dA is a large trollfest
Just saw it go back up.
I never said "you all suck if you use it"
7Yet 'dA is a large trollfest'.
You guys need to pick up Alien Swarm 4p co-op and it's free.
6ok well you kind of do this all the time
drf gave his opinion
6so it's getting really aggravating
again
and no one cares about it
again
Hey. Killing Floor. I have that.
let's try not to make this place into the trollfest, guys. lol
And I also have Alien Swarm.
I like the way you think Armads.
That would make me sad.
6lol
9I bugged out
No-one really plays it anymore, though.
6this is a daily habit I think
6arguments and such
Yeah, I noticed that when I loaded it up a couple weeks ago.
9I have Alien Swarm 2
9got it off the free thing
6anyways, plush to work on
alien breed 2
not swarm
7Sprites to do!
Yeah, not the same.
man, that TST is such a trollfest
that Armads always trollin all over the place
9oh that
9wait
Armads, I know right
9wasn't swarm the one you had to pay for?
9oh wait nvm
No
9wasn't swarm free?
Swarm is free.
yes
Swarm is free.

which one?
Valve gave it away free last summer I think?
the one about fishcakes
I mean
o.o fishcakes
Lol.
Fund it.
It was around March '10
Alien swarm is one of steam's free games
no but really, which one?
fund it, like a product? lol
fishcakes™. Fund it.
LOL
probably the topic before things got all srs, drf. lol
most people just play it for the hat
Might have helped keep it alive a little longer.
I seem to recall the topic starting with the same message for years though
the one I'm positive I don't remember in the slightest
the topic of the conversation, not the chan lol
though you could be rebellious and change it :O
just to say you did.
I hated it when you'd get an "one man army" team member that'd leave everyone else behind.
"fishcakes™. Fund it."

Are best difficulties
oh, the ones that go on speed runs without telling anyone?
It's not my fault I swear!
02brb
...
I lol'd.
getting there, dari. lol
Just like "Fuck you! I'm going alone."
02LOLno.
EW TWITTER
Lol Armads.
etc
Too much telling of every action. lol
I know right
GUYS.
I AM TYPING.
just to let you all know.
If IRC was normally like twitter I wouldn't use it.
Makes sense
that and people confusing this channel with #RP
02NO WAY
everytime people 'stab' each other etc
On lower difficulties I preferred melee only runs to running off on my own.
gtfolmfao
I mainly don't like this place for the script spam lol
9there
02D:
Hey! There we go!
9video finally fixed
p:
02now'll brb
02¬¬
there needs to be a channel exclusively for that.
XD
02#TMI?
02XD
no, for script spam lol
Armads: I thought there was? If you're talking about script spam.
oh
02#ircgames
well good
we have one
Yeah.
Because mods can still spam it here.
:P
eh, fair enough lol
not really
just bugs me when people !_____ instead of actually talking.
10 second trigger limit
Grab the tech with the extra melee damage and the glove that dealt extra melee damage as well. One shots all the little guys.
regardless of mod status.
is fine*
I never said *spamming* scripts
actually it is
you monster.
Zed time annoys me.
k.
see
They should make it something activeatable, not random.
as much as I may be disagreeable, can anybody disagree that I keep the channel alive? :P
and o.O @ that line
7Or at least, have more productive discussions.
>IRC
>productive
pretty sure those are the thesaurus under "antonyms"
Dammit, I'm at 6/7 for hard campaign.
yep
Yup :p
they are
7Yeesh.
DRF and I create tons of discussions
Hurp
^
7Good for you.
MFW I've used IRC productively a lot
well
the only server I've known to ever be productive is freenode
yeah, people take everything seriously
myself included lol
rule #1, don't take me seriously
then I remember I don't give a damn
:D
unless I say otherwise

9but yeah
Quany, s/we/you?
9medical studies about how the brain percieves time during stress/fear
7s?
yes

^
9determined it can be somewhat random at times
9so yeah
9Zed time is, ironically, somewhat realistic
7Eh, you've probably figured from how many arguments you supposedly cause.
now that's some lazy markup. lol
Armads finds it easier to just type sentences honestly XD;
oh right
that thing.
lol
it takes longer to type
EW TXTSPK, but s/a/b is actually pretty well known.
also
not by me lol :(
I just kinda figured it out.
EW BIAS

I mean hey, you can't please everybody.
/me Editor's note: Armads is the most biased person he knows
I'm actually just annoyed by it universally. Ugly word, lol.
It's more like eugh in the UK anyway.
some people may get mad at me on occasion, but I think overall I bring conversation
no
conversation is not allowed here
gtfo
:(
LOL
Me?
yes you
orly?
Yeah.
Kinda like I'm not doing right now.
lol
or something you dislike
XD
I'd eat it.
knowing manly
he'd probably just look at it
and it'd burst into flames.
^
LOL
rofl
when I see something weird, whether it's on me or not
I always go "the hell?"
One time I thought I had six fingers on my right hand
and I went "the hell?"
lol, you probably can :P
still, most people I know use the word ew in some way or another
*wakes up and sees clock on 7:15 even though he set the alarm for 6:00*
"the hell?"
7Seems a bit desaturated; would you like it saturated or desaturated?
you mean spambox
but sure xD
though
doesn't stalking usually imply not talking?

Rayquaza is my all time favorite

Bai Rora

LOL @ pic
it looks like a derp in thatl
its teeth
Yeah
are like durr
7At least, Armads, you're not trying to push some other action.
=Wtf XD
Quany, I don't push actions either. people just assume.
7No, you insinuate.
~
/me runs
that means people assume.
02I agree
and that's on them, not me.
LOL, Bidoof is useful as an HM slave
02with Armads.
It teleported!
define 'deal with'
He regenerates health.
well, kind of
turns out I restored it to factory defaults
'cause you know
02bidoof*

Lol.
etc
:P
9yeah
9I know
02LOL.

But he thought the router had been hacked, XD
I wanna make it to the hall of fame with a team of unown
Hahahaha.

Shouldn't have trapped him in the room. Left you all nowhere to run in a failure situation.
/me shot
9that strategy tends to work though
LOL
9when we got a bunch of pipe bombs, that is
No :P
For TF2, why are they giving the soldier even more weapons?
XD
But I ended up telling him it was me
YOU haxxed it?!
jk
He's been paranoid about being "hacked" lately
:P
4GHOSTIES HAS RETURNED

4How did you guys like Killing Floor?
9Ghosties we gotta retry this shit

4I'm worn out
9ah well
pretend he isn't there
9think I'll stop streaming now
4I honestly didn't think Normal was gonna be that fucking terrible
wow
I like Ontels' posts.
Just "spam".
Lawl.
he said I HATE PONIES like 50 times
9don't really got anything else to stream
9hey wait
9maybe I could try L4D for once
Ontels's strike me as whining
9a sec
/me rages
I hate calculus
whining about being told off for being too mean
me too :(
my notes look like crap
∫
LOL
I'm sure I have notes somewhere.
Letter!

/me hides
but I haven't done it in like two years rofl
SF is such a steaming pile of crap now.

9I somehow got the achievement on hard
4Probably

Woah.
Lol.
The best way to kill him is to corner him.
But you have little room to get away from him.
4With everything
4Oh, and I fucking loved Resident Evil Outbreak <3
4We got Patty on one knee, though
4But he came back
4Recuperated
I think I have that movie sitting in my living room unwatched.
4Cowardly Patty
math puns
This map has a really long intro...
are the first sine of madness
ahahahaha
GET ON WITH IT!
4It takes about 3 minutes to finish
4:O
XD
/me hasn't either
4Wha
I don't count playing like 5 minutes of 1 and 4 each.
RE2 is my favorite in the series
4PEELZ
4PEELZ
4PEELZ never changes
I've played 4, 5 and Code Veronica.
PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELZ
I've played only 2.
I like how every bottle was standing completely upright.
I've played all except 4 and 5
4I've played and owned Resident Evil, RE Director's Cut, RE2, RE3, RE4, RE Code Veronica, OUtbreak, Outbreak File #2
And that card couldn't run it full-blast.
I remember there was this log cabin joke.
9BRB
9mom being annoying
aww
4I've beaten RE5, but refuse to buy it
orly
4Oh, and Resident Evil Zero as well as the REmake for Gamecube
I never played RE because I used to hate FPS and I thought it was one. Still do.
daaren I mean
derp
12true or false
lol
12true
12:)
RE isn't an FPS.
makes me confuss
What's the integral of (1/cabin)d(cabin)?
lol
A natural log cabin.
oh
log(cabin)?
ln(cabin)
/me hides
I used to know how to do logarithms

Lol.
4Time out for Razyun
bbl
4*Razyn
I only played MGS1
it was great though
4Never once played MGS...what kind of fucked up world do I live in *shaking head*
This reminds me, I still need to finish MGS3.
I've played MGS1 - 4. Beat 1 - 3.
I need to finish 4.
Well, I grew up on platformers, and kind of grew biased towards them in a sort immature way.
4Yes, Nittany, you do
4MGS4 was simply put, brilliant
I've never played MGS.
I wanted to play 2 and 3, but by that time PCSX2 wasn't decent enough to play at anything above 10 fps
I should try it again
Hurray for Dari!
4Even if the majority of its detractors believe it's convoluted
4Yeah, there is that
I don't really care.
4A lot of people consider it like an interactive movie, and I also really don't care
Fourth one had an hour long cutscene
4One of the biggest reasons I play MGS is for the story, and 4 doesn't fail to deliver
I enjoyed every second of it
That actually doesn't sound half bad. I like story, which is why I attached a negative stigma to FPSs.
Is that possible?
4What
no
you simp[ly watch
4I still enjoyed it
4Love the story
4Loved the characters too
First you need to get an old school hockey mask.
that's how
O
=>
I don't disrespect stories like that.
Δ
4It's advisable, but definitely not necessary. You get the backstory for those in MGS1
I have those on a PS2 disk. Got stuck on #1
I'll most likely pick it up from the PSN.
Because PS Roms scare me.
4Is it on PSN?
DCD's not here
oh my
Damn
4The story is phenomenal, the acting is tight, and the gameplay is a lot of fun too
Nn... It might not topple FFIV, but I'm still trying it.
4But yeah, sorry guys. Look's like the stream's over tonight :(
I'm one of those people that haven't played FF7.
...MGS.
Same.
I have FF12.
Haven't touched it.
you haven't missed much :p
And it's a collector's edition.
4But great, glad you're gonna try it out
be one of the cool kids and play wrpgs instead
I don't play many RPGs. Up until now, I've been a FPS person.
Now that FPS are steering from being SP games, I'm going towards something else.
4SP as in single player, Nittany?
for good singleplayer fps games
Yeah.
I suck online.
I can't get into BF games because they're fucking difficult.
BF?
Battlefield.
difficult? nah
4Ah
Battlefield?
just takes a while to learn how to not die in 2 seconds
It was.
really?
I liked B2
4Really
I can't kill shit on there.
huh lol
yeah
well, I'm kinda looking forward to bf3
DX 11 all the way
since it's supposed to be more realistic
than certain other shooters
And no matter how many bullets I throw at the enemy, I end up dying.
BF2 left a permanent bad taste in my mouth.
CoD used to be great.
USED to
I can't stand him.
He's ruining the gaming industry.
4A lot of people don't like Kotick
Yeah.
yep
aka Activision's CEO
I want to get people together to protest AAA games in order to cut sales because I hate the AAA gaming industry.
Kotick is evil.
He openly admits it.
He openly admits to milking his customers.
And taking the fun out of making games.
yeah the origin thing
That.
is pretty bullshit
4Definitely
mhm
They banned two people from playing DA 2 because of things they said on a forum.
4Exactly
02*WB03(Light_Latias03)02WB* - <Light_Latias> 12Chaos, panic, and disorder. My work here is done~
And then they championed something I hate: Online Passes.
12hot out ><;
:<
/me ices
4They didn't have enough time to work everything out though
Are you sure it isn't something else
/me 12holds ice against every inch of her body ><;
7Hmm.
12it prolly is something else too :/
7I'm getting very close to my limit for DRF.
Aww
12hmm?
12what'd he do this time? o.o
7Upset more people.
4Of course
7As usual.
And I know a lot of gamers know that.
How?
But no-one's doing anything about it.
12^
4You're joking
4Right?
Except I've tried.
7You know, his dissuasion of certain tools and implication toward his preferences.
4Well
4Don't ever complain about their game...EVER
12in other words, same-old same-old :/
7Yep.
12well
12good news for you all
12if he's de-Opped
4Yep yep
12he's going to leave TST permanently
Valve could do it if they feel like it, but they have a heart.
12then he's as good as gone
7Good for the rest of us.
Orly nao
Verizon has the worst customer support ever. They tried to automate everything.
Yeah.
I really want to get verbal protests together.
/me 12slaps Hyper
:<
/me faints
How.
With an EULA
4It's DRM
4Digital Rights Media, basically
4All their top games are like that now
12o-o
wow RDS FAIL
MFW they don't
They claimed to.
Not validated by law at the moment I'm fairly sure.
And they took it away.
And they could because of the EULA.
Illegally.
12hiyas Shiny~
And they got sued multiple times when they did it.
02You should play with Manly and I
Those lawsuits are still bouncing about.
12if this keeps up, I'll have to join you as a Fire-type
12hmm?
12join you as a fire-type?
12what
Money doesn't help you win.
12nvm
02:P
Necessarily.
EULAs do.
12what is this some sort of PMD MMO
/me 7hmms.
Unless they break the law.
12no Glacy o.o
12and ._.
/me 12shudders

I didn't even know about SecuROM when I bought Spore.
12no
12but
Nor install limits.
12it kinda looked like an oversized grasshopper
02Cicada?
12praying mantis?
They just settled.
12those things creep me out
Geohot had to get money together to hire good enough lawyers to stay in the battle.
12not a cicada
12and Glacy
12I HOPE it wasn't a praying mantis
Geohot has also pissed many people off.
He got 1000s in donations.
12tho
12praying mantises are harmless
12it kinda looked like it...
its one of a couple bugs that don't make me nervous
I had one crawling on my arm before and it kind of tickled
Hai!
12it's also one of the only animals that share the same type of vision with us lol
praying mantis's are cute :>
12oh frak
/me 12googled pics
12it looks JUST like it ._.
12and I killed it...

florida is where Armads lives
and yeah there are geckos everywhere

12they're cute
12:3
I think the one that showed up in my room was one.
Also when they sued about 50 people.
12you can always have a dangerous spider nearby
to this day I don't know how it got in there
12if it's in it's natural habitat or if it hitch hiked a ride from elsewhere

Could care less?
Because you need food!~
12isn't the best idea
4Oh, couldn't care less
Yep. Could care less.
Oh.

12i'll be offering you a slice
This is the first I've heard of that.
And tries to get their hand into the used market.
You think other industries wouldn't if they could?
4EA does it now
4And Warner as well
Warner does it?
12it's like my fuel
How?
Ubisoft is much worse.
02that's coffee for me
4They're following EA's path
Ubisoft had that damn online connection requirement.
Sony's probably the worst company though.
4That's how they get you in used sales
04mew
They dropped the always-on DRM.
on*
:>
4One good place online to get games is gog.com
4DRM free
Securom, still not as bad as Starforce.

I heard that Starforce ruined CD drives.

Ubisoft's lasted a month.
And it probably had 90% of it's sales in the first 3 weeks.
12what you playing?
Yeah.
Mission Accomplished.
6I SEE A PORNY PRANCIN'
I heard that many people tried to take their copies back because they couldn't play their copies due to connection issues.
I knew exactly how they'd react
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/Hotel_Mario.jpg LOL at this pic, I just noticed Mario's leg is in the wrong place
I know that DRM is used to ensure high first-week sales.

12i'm updating something right now
After they learned that they had a 90% piracy rate.
12TOLD YOU there was an update
Wow.
12@Danny
03yeah
But I think games with DRM have the same rate.
03that's odd though
03as mine didn't need to update yesterday
Oh.
12mine's speshul :3
6iFail..
6Wow..these people hate everything.. o.o
I would have thought indie games would have lower piracy rates because people would feel worse about pirating their games.

Haha, yeah
I know, but that's the spyro fandom for ya
Indie games may suffer more from piracy.
LOL
I would condone it since I support indie developers.
I think they have a lot more heart than AAA publishers.
"Uh guys... if you're gonna pay 0.00 anyway, could you please you a torrent instead of our official download servers. :/"
03http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uPpZ2kbeL.jpg <- XD @ something a friend showed me
6D:
12not surprised
But at least they're not stuck behind a AAA publisher who's going to force them on a schedule.
12blah my neck still hurts a little
What're you talking about?
Hmm?
6DREAM OF MIRRORS FTW
I can't picture a protest working in this day and age.
I'm talking about verbal protests.
What's verbal protesting?
Yeah.
I'm not sure how successful it was, not very I'm thinking though.
Like people picket-signing against AAA publishers.
Petitions fail.
03so about those pokémon games

Hello DLC!
Now stop right there.
I never have to do that.
Is it just certain kinds of games?
When?
It hasn't expanded beyond MMOs yet.
03<bluesun> I'd guess not... or at least no RSE publicly announced
Like I said, CoD: Elite is the beginning.
It's going to start because companies get loads more money this way.
I wouldn't say all.
But a lot.
It's a good thing I mainly play single player!

I buy some used now to deny publishers I hate money.

I don't hate CoD.

unless you can tell me otherwise
that victini is for the AR capabilities of the 3D pokedex
03oh, yeah he said that was about the 3D Pokédex
I loved custom matches and Infection.
And Grifball.
and that is 3DS only
I can't play console FPS. :/

I also played a lot of UT2K4.

03oh, but yeah. the magazine comes out tomorrow
MFW it's HD.
I'm one that doesn't like to play a lot.

/me has a PS3...
as NS isnt away anymore XD
That's why I don't like XBL's fee. Inhibits people like me to try MPs out for free.
Hahaha.
That'd be great. XD
I have a PS3 and 360.
or PS3.
/me has a PS3
I hear a lot of XBL fanboys dis PSN.
Especially when I complain about the fee.
Meh, console wars are annoying.
The rest can go die. I just want to play online a bit.
They could, but why would they?
They won't.
They hooked too many people into paying the fee when the Xbox came out.
/me 4doesn't have a PS3 :(
Again, people don't think. They just buy.
/me has a launch model PS3.
Not too cheap to get nowadays.
/me is slim
Other than GT5.
Launch models can play PS1 and PS2 games.
/me has launch model 600 GB PS3
GT5? Meh.
:p
Well, if you like racing games that is. :P
I have it mainly for the exclusives.
4That's enough for me to warrant a purchase of a PS3
^ Other than that one.
Yeah, they can play PS1. Maybe I could just borrow MGS...
Free online play got me.
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/epic-fail-photos-animal-identification-fail.jpg

There he is.
4Like I did
4I first played MGS when I was 11
I set up a site with a proper (sort of, .co.cc) domain.
But we haven't switched over to that yet.

I prefer Microsoft's direction of taking desktop OSes to portable devices
They may be few and far between, but it's not exactly fair to just rule them out as annoying idiots.
Majora's Mask had polygons
Hello Barry.
Yes. It did.
That is SOOOOOO AWESOME
If done right, it can create more flexibility while still retaining ease of use

02But I'm missing one song
Ohh
03provided they're not in some stupid format, i should be able to convert them to wav
o.o
02.mp3 plz
03Aurora
03we have that soundtrack on hoshinet
03and uh, sure, I need to convert to wav first anyway :P
gay
/me hides
03as far as Pokémon goes
03well
like,?
03like instrumental versions of the Pokémon theme songs.
03the only actual good quality one I have is Johto Journeys from that promo disc
03I have this 1-minute runtime version of the Indigo theme some random person sent me
wait you do?
vol. 2?
03but the full length one is like horrible quality, as it came from Pokémon Music Network
03Yes.
k...
um
vol 2 is under musicftp\ost\jap\2011
one sec
k
03that would require her to have an FTP program, right:?"
they are
03I have the DVds which are even more legit
http://www.mediafire.com/?zatwaxmfnfp6gqa the 2010OST in MP3
source: http://dragonsoulfansub.com.ar/?web=mu
03which volume is that
V1
03well I can get the flacs myself
necisito V2

7hmhmhm
I don't know why I said that lol
03xD
They see me rollin
They lovin
how do I get V2?
03...NOW iTunes added that album to their store
03>mac
^
>so?
03also why 5+?
03Winamp 2.91 plays flac...
Dey hatin da lovin
just curious
Cog can play FLac on Mac
03so therefore
03we don't keep lower quality versions
mp3s aren't stored on the server because >space
03if that makes sense
03yeah
k
03I suppose I can convert it for you if you want
But we keep on lovin
filezilla and Cyberduck and Finder are free FTP clients for mac
...
03LOL Cyberduck
03filezilla is like the best thing ever
03maybe it's the OS

03that's expected
03I suppoes the only good programs are the cross-platform ones
English lavendar.
filezilla is X-platform
it sucks on mac
Logic isn't X-platform. It's great
No, it's the fault of my slow internets combined with mac neglect.
03w/e
CoreAudio is one of the best audio APIs/Frameworks out there.
yes
/me faceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepalms
No
03what
For windoes, there's ASIO, MME, Dsound, etc
:o
02I'm stupid, lol. ignore plz
none is entirely satisfactory
03I just need to find something that can play that stupid UN Owen was Her MIDI without breaking >_>
FL Studio?
/me RUNS
:o
03does FL Studio even play midis?
FL Studio is not a Audio IO framework.
no, but you can import MIDIs and assign instruments to them.
drf, yeah
;p
03uh
03assign instruments...?
03so it wouldn't sound um
03what's that word
03proper?
basically midi remix them
03well
03if it won't even play in Winamp/WMP/whatever
03I highly doubt it would play in FL
03just because of uber massive note overload
That's because they all use the SAME engine
If FL have their own engine, fine, maybe
03does FL Studio use the same thing that WMP uses?
03hm
There's also ACID, Presonus ONE, CAkewalk SONAR, and a bazillion other multitracks
03I used that back in middle school
03thing was a pain to use
oh?
04hi
I've found that all I need is baisically A.
03A?
and mb GB/Logic for instruments

03I SAID touhou
I saw a program

03:O
03The MIDI file?
but it wasn't that program
03well
03I don't care LOL
it was the same version though
03if it works
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euadl2uWy_g
03that.
03I tried that./
03didn't work
03in fact
oh
strange
since it's working there
03nope, it's not
03most of it works
03it's the part with the massive glisscendos (sp) that breaks
02Bed time
I know that song well enough
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxy9zOZXxYQ
03...
03wtf?
ok
XD
03it actually didn't break
...
no
my point was that was one that played the whole thing through
03I never said you would
03right
03maybe there's an updated version or something
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYHA_7vxrgc
03I'll try out Synthesia then
I think I did
It stuutters, but it does a very nice job of displaying pretty pictures while stuttering :>

._.
Wut.
I have a phobia
._.
...
Lady birds are awesome though.
I didn't think anyone disliked them.
O_o
Their shells scare me
Or w/e
...
Wow.
And when they fly
;0;
I just hate them, not scared
Stink bugs are my mortal enemies
O_o
If those are beetles
/me now belongs to Link for 9 minutes and has to fly Link around until then
12noooooooooool;k;sda
/me sends bill cosby after link
LOL

/me scares Bill Cosby away by impersonating his accent

Bees...?
Not wasps?
i need some programs to make orchestral remixes
Unless you're alergic I see no reason for fear.
imagine, Hotel Mario's theme Orchestrated XD
I got stung by a swarm of bees 13 times when I went camping once
Hate them all now
I've never felt pain like that
For like 12 hours too
03"Commander Keen: The Teenage Years"
Never been stung by a bee or wasp, and I've had them land on my face before, and had wasps nests around the house numerous times.
03it was good editing, though a bit corny./
03X:D
03*XD
It sucks
I didn't even bother them
We were just walking
Guess we walked into their territory rofl
03anyway
k
cya drf
Do you just not like average sized spiders?
Or do you dislike tarantulas too?
I hate all spiders
The bees
and buzzed very loud
Yeah frk
From my memory
And very loud
XD
Idk if horse flies chase tho
Those bees chased us a good quarter mile
It went in my shoes my back
._.
Oh, was bees then.
They were trying to kill us I swear
Flies don't chase you, bees do.
You probably walked near a hive without noticing it.
There's these like, wasps or bees or something in our yard
Maybe
They like live in the ground
Like WTF don't they check for that?
Lol
Well they could have set up their hive there recently.
It's a pretty busy camp area though
Because it was massive.
Bees in my area aren't that bad though
Oh
It would suck living in Australia
XD
I would die I swear lol
I remember seeing that the wasps in Japan are the worst though.
The only thing I like about spiders is that they eat flies
I hate flies.
Not scared, just find them annoying
They get hornets that are 2 inches long.
And they're common.
._.
They can keep them :3
Maybe you'd like them though.
Lol
And then we brought in bears to take care of the hornets
LOL
I have hornet spray
Bears to deal with hornets known as the "yak-killer".
;o
Bears get chased away by normal wasps/bees. :P
Then we bring in nukes.
XD
Hahaha.
"Our city is overrun with hornets!" - NUKE THE CITY.
Damn.
._.
Now just imagine a swarm of them. :)
Have u seen those praying manta
Mantua
Mantis
There's a prayin mantis. :P
http://papermodels.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/giant-hornet-300x228.jpg?w=300&h=228
Could be worse
That can eat birds?
I like praying manti
Mantises
Goliath bird-eating spider > mantis
Praying mantis could probably only eat a hummingbird at best. :P
Lol
Spiders
LOL
They're 30cm long at best.
Waking up with a spider on my face
I would suicide I swear lol
I can't believe people have like pet tarantulas
That's crazy
Tarantulas are fuzzy though. :>
Scary
Wow, the bird-eater lives 15-25 years.
Impressive.
And... yeah.
._.
Omg
He said if he wasn't on the toilet he would have shat his pants.
Lol.
Lol
And one time they found it in the fridge
LOL
._.
See?
That's one good diet plan
You need more ham.
12http://chzragecomics.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/rage-comics-shes-pokemon-black-thats-where-she-is.jpg
You'll regret it.
They're harmless though.
Own like fish
Something that'll die if it tries to escape.
They aren't harmless
Well nemo escaped
Tarantulas can shoot out those fuzzy hairs
But that was Hax
usually harmless, but if you breath it in you'll be fucked up
Nemo Irl would have died
Just sayin'
I heard like
Cuz the males are shredding
they*
Aggressive
._.
I figure having them lay eggs would be problematic
Cuz they think Ur hand is another male
Idk lol

Else you could emulate replies to make her say just about anything.
simulate, even.
During an early development stage, I had a friend of me do that just to see how vulnerable it was.
the reply comming later at least makes more sense than if it had tried to anonymise it's self ;p

Minnet: be floofy
Still doesn't recognise me
no, because you're not added.
Minnet: version Draelen
trying to exploit the versioning function already? :p
Rawr.
Sorry, but I couldn't understand that reply.. You sure it conforms to the RFC?
I approve of this reply screening ;p
and you hit my default fallback in case of unsafe version replies :p
Ahem.
anything understandable for my string.match() patterns :p
also
2011-07-21/16:06:05 : DEBUG Received incomprehensible CTCP VERSION reply from Draelen on tst
not * NICK [current nick]
And they weren't in the config
was one added there that should not have been?
I had to restore backups to fix it
there were about 5 added
it was weird
because afaik SRAs are done from the config not the dbs
No idea, either an exploit, or using some internal undocumented commands
which only ulines can access
local reply = l:match("VERSION%s*(.-)%\001")
I see ;p
Minnet: version Draelen
Yeah, I figured that, oh well
hmm, it was the carridge return I included
/me tries linefeed
Minnet: version Draelen
Sorry, but I couldn't understand that reply.. You sure it conforms to the RFC?
Alright, I think it's safe enough ;p
and I see, is the actual text of the ctcp reply displayed in the console? ;p
no. :>
only this
2011-07-21/16:11:51 : DEBUG Received incomprehensible CTCP VERSION reply from Draelen on tst
/me nods
there's some fun things one can do for text directly displayed to the console that users can manipulate
I know.
she's slightly vulnerable for that
I should probably fix that though.
updated the git repo a lil' by the way
didn't push earlier.
Excuse me?
Minnet: reload funcs.lua
Excuse me?
Minnet: reload functions.
I see ;p
/me may be distracted at work now and then</info>
I've implemented support for completely coloured lines, but not partially coloured ones.
character 8 usually deletes the previous character before it in the console
:p
have fun
hehe
I've tried avoiding that
but go ahead, it'd be fun :p
there's likely few places that can happen
mhm.
14Minnet: say hi.
Hi.
okay, still works.
it's nice to be able to reload parts like that ;p
yeah, I like it :p
and as a safer alternative to running code directly given to her
you can instead use a designated file, and then reload it.
hm
useful for debugging/testing situations that may be difficult to try replicate on the server
/me puts an example together
Excuse me?
mhm.
you just reminded me of an unrelated function..
Minnet: say hello to Draelen
Draelen: Hello
Minnet: Hello
Excuse me?
/me chuckles
Minnet is forgetful
Hello, Minnet.
Figured as much ;p
Excuse me?
Minnet: time
Excuse me?
should implement that.
>.>
she has a simple ctcp time response though.
now to debug the uptime function..
I see it
2011-07-21/16:29:35 : INFO Received CTCP TIME request from Draelen on tst
:p
har
hmm o.o
/me plots
Minnet: set output level to internal
this is going to give me some ugly output, but okay..
when debug's not enough~
Minnet: how long is the system uptime?
goddammit.
Minnet: how long have you been online?
hah, found it.
typo.
Minnet: set debug level to info
Seems to work now ;p
yup.
Minnet: how long you been online now?
yo
No idea if that worked, but peek at Minnets console
Yes, I have a little too much free time at work today~
I see nothing :o
Minnet: set output level to debug
try again?
mirc may have capitalisiedified it
Hmm, did try ;p
still nothing~
what'cha doing? :p
Interesting, let me try something a little less invalid
Yes, rather random, pity minnet ignored it ;p
nah, she filters all but those she knows~
hmm
Minnet: Version Draelen
Minnet: version Draelen
whatever did you do /this/ time?
:p
Sorry, but I couldn't understand that reply.. You sure it conforms to the RFC?
/me petpets Minnet
enjoy :>
;>
hi.
Now, where were we..
Minnet: Know me yet?
Excuse me?
...
sheesh.
Minnet: be floofy.
/me is floofy.
Good.
/me pets Minnet
Now quit nagging <.<
lol whut
/me hides
At least I'm not whining.
/me RUNS
goodnight
goodnight
g'night.
03D:
Night for myself too, soon

but whatever.

But this?

but come on
I'm hoping it's not designed to be server software
I was really, SERIOUSLY thinking of getting a Mac next year
/me hides
/me facepalms
I beg to differ
but still
if you're going to get a unix-based server
Yeah
Unless all you serve is podcasts and such
Hmmm?!
just like any Posix OS
because they're Posix/Unix.
Pos OS?
Posix is a standard.
or a set of standards, rather.
but it's mainly DOS and NT - that is, in-house dev.
yeah
oh, concepts, truly
Everything's out there is now Unix or NT
NT ftw
unix > NT
for servers maybe
Mostly for servers

and gaming
Heh, yeah
AIM for Android, y u no work
That hulking registry

And the fact that Group Policy Editor isn't available on Home editions
Yeah, but for simple use, it's fine
For some people it can be too much
