The thrid was a bit lacking.
Kurra: Same. There are some REALLY dumb and contrived parts. If the characters aren't constantly tossing around the idiot ball, they're Goldblum's self-righteous and ultimately right ass.
Copperhead: yep...
Oh my

Don't forget the evil cultist robot faction of the fight.

Vordox, thank you for all of the trivia. That was very generous of you.
eeyup. epicness.
But think of the rides!
9/10. What can I say? It's a classic. It takes a bit for things to get going, but once it does, it doesn't let up. Characters are a tad flat, but better than most action flicks.
Oh god no, disney can just stop

This theme song gets me so wet.

laser jesus
i give this movie a sound 10 victims out of 10
I haven't seen this one in a while, so it's all kind of new to me in a sense.

Fun Trivia, alternative: In the original script, Gennaro and Malcolm were combined into one character, and Muldoon survived in the end. In the original book, Gennaro and Muldoon both survived, and Hammond and Malcolm died (though Malcolm returned in The Lost World: Jurassic Park, explaining that "doctors did excellent work").

John_Williams no

Testing out your talents on a farm? Better try to read minds...
because they maintain their good looks with constant massages and sauna trips
only thing I hated about the movie was that it used Who Let The Dogs Out, which I despise
Fl00t4sh41: I like how AJ seems to be Rarity's closest friend now.
Bronysith: because you're attracted to them
Also John Lovitz
worst game ever
Simple answer, ponies arent sexy :D
Idea!
dat face
IshCleverGirl: Look up parody by sexualobster.
thats because it is
hehehe
PUSH ALL THE BUTTONS!
I also remember complaining to my mom that it was 2000 and there no flying cars!!! Jetsons lied to me!!!!
just thinking that ..... wait a miinute ...
UNO
dog?
fck it just spam all the buttons XD
RaveBrony: that too
/me gives John_Williams boobies
Wel... technically she got it
Twilight had a really big growth to
CUTIE MARK CRUSADER GHOST BUSTERS
Exactly!
APPLEBLOOM YOU CHEATED
that works
BLANK FLLLAANNKKKKK
SKYRIM
For me what sealed the deal on liking Rarity was the Dog and Pony Show
RaveBrony: they're cute.
IshCleverGirl: I'm... not sure how to feel about these.
same eye coulour
Wat? would their cutie marks be cards?
Sweetie's eyes
OMG am I a phichic
this part is sorta sad in a way
I find it funny that the best moments of the mane 6 are when they are out-of-character
Im gunna make a parody
Twilight has the advantage of being the main character.
I know that was a sad time
<--- Before Windigos?
RainbowDerpy: i see what they did right there...ADVERTISEMENT
dem eyes
thats a werid ass rock
DocSane: They did have some flirting
A parody parody PARODY
either that or her prediction was WAY off :p

Lah-burr-yens.
Great example, back to the future 2
definitely not one of the best
no wings
I DIDN'T PUT THAT IN MY BAHG
cowvarkian: nope. and i don't find babies cute.
Babies look like potatoes (Stolen from the interwebs)
What are these weird technicolor donkeys?

Cuz learning?
Cherilee's mane looks delicious
wings
the team should add sea-ponies in the future
Sounds like a line that'd be in FiW... "I had nothing to do with this!" >_>
I demand my own hover board
Screw you, Cherrilee is awesome. ;3
CHERLEE WAT R UDOIN WIT UR BAHG
LOVE ME CHERILEE
I think Sweetie has talent for singing. LIKE ME :)
Oh, right. I saw Scootaloo without her wings

Eli: just going with a larger consensus

Bronysith: Maybe Cherilee needs a book?
OohShiny: Like... CHERRIES?
Pinkie: I LIKE HER

I can't sing. But I can play drums.
EMBARRASS YOURSELF!!! YEAH!!!
John_Williams: STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM
Tyler_The_Creator: You must be new around here
Dark_OOkami: I disagree. Fluttershy seems to be that in "Green Isn't Your Color", but AJ seems to be the one that Rarity can have actual heart to heart conversations with.
Oh

Time for green tea.
That number of 'Total' views
I loved Suviovor and FearFactor.
I'm a furry so I guess that also makes me somewhat of a clopper
I believe that there can be no best fandom.

Sure.
Bronysith: On just that one thing?

KIDS NEXT DOOR!

Boom ba da tush
SHOOBEEDOO
THE SHIT OCs?
yes!
Shizuka: Like for Gak and stuff?
05,15sonicdude558 no video links
hot climates are a bit boring. i can agree
Bronysith: ...srly, if you think it sucks, hat are you doing here?
they tast a bit funny though
yum
*throws the TALKING pizza to DerpyDitzyDoo*
OR THE TYPICAL FANFICTIONS?!
I would have gone for hawaiian, but that's all they had.
o
ME
whats the b movie again?
..
am I the only one here who actually enjoyed reading cupcakes
Eli: because he's a hipster
That was like the coolest stuff ever!
Mods are now intervening!
05,15Have you guys just been arguing all night?
OMFG IM GETTING WING STREET
Bronysith: the OCs are made up by little kids.
let's just say near the equator line
i will always eat muffins
Eli: cause there are some good bronies out there
RUN AND HIDE
I would love it if the writers added sea-ponies in this series
this one you found is pretty nice, whos kitchen did you take it out of?
fluttercry: yes
13Okay seriously.
13Stop spamming.
Kids Next Door made me sad when I turned 13 lol
Eli: *bronies
Bronysith: *the shit OCs
but seriously Rat Race would be awesome, but I don't think its a b movie, too many high profile actors
OMFG THIS NIGHT JUST GOT 200% COOLER
/me gets hit by Juice's pizza instead.
13You'd all best read the rules at http://www.bronystate.net/rules
near australia

Ecuador?
oh my god its what i always wanted XD a talking pizza, he shall be named toryama XD
I have an OC :(
Pizza: HI I'M PIZZA
13Movie night will resume after the intermission.
freezing my backside off would certainly fit this rut ive been in :D
I do hate the heat. I hate the cold too.. But it's easier (and more comfy) to bundle up than sweat your plot off! :$
05,15We worked hard on those.
The colors used in OCs hurt my eyes
Jeez. again?
coinflip2, Low budget movie
Shizu layin down the law
HOLD YOUR CHILDREN CLOSE!
Really? I still make it in time for the B Movie?
Shizuka: what are they spamming?
RaveBrony: yeah, i meant shit OCs. there are good ones
i dont have a true o/c but i made some :P
this night will hit 600% if we get back to more ponies
OH MY GAWD
Hey AJIsAwesome
J_E_Smith71: Hey bro
are we having a lottery
How long will this intermission last?
You also have to incorporate the other side of the fandom in your "worst fandom" judgement, Bronysith. Sometimes that side just take things too far.
Pizza: Eat me
I fell out of line with the plot at that time, I think I was in to Ben 10.
Yes what are we Spamming?
or at least get Daring Doo
anyone know when VGA are
i found it in rarity's shop, weird right
I LOVE U PIZZA
richfiles true
isnt there a pony named tally ho?
but its not an A movie
richfiles: Thats true
RISE AGAINST THE OP!
it was a funny day when Irish_pony AKA Major found out his OC was in bad pony oc tumblr
Shizuka: Hey, you got the power. Start booting people if you have to!
RainbowDerpy: Tomorrow
*takes
wierd
Pizza: EAT ME
05,15Blitzwing right now
Sumica: im still here
My Oc has my skin color, hair color, and eye color. And is an earth pony too, lol.
PricessLollipopGear: ya I know haha, but what is the actual movie?
13about to
And that makes me sad, the fact that I thought it was so cool.
NO i love you too much XD
Biltzwing: 9pm EST i think
AND IM NOT LOSING!!!
o.o this is Rarity's sink?
SPIKE HAS A CRUSH ON RARITY
Before we get into the B Movie, I'd just like to ask you guys for advice. I'm having trouble choosing which Left 4 Dead game to go for. I played L4D2 during the free weekend and enjoyed it, but I'm hearing from a forum thread that L4D1 is the one to support.
REALLY?
wut's Blitzwing?
so awesome I)^3^(I
:P
Yes, very true, indeed.
Judging a fandom based on it's negativities is not a fair judgement, in my opinion.
We Will Rise :|
*Pizza gets bit by Bon-Bon*
whatch to whacht ponies or VGA's
YOU DONT SAY!!!
don't give away spikes secret!
RISE
My mother had a really excellent concert tonight. That's why I wasn't here for A
*its
one of my o/c is a alicorn
Movie or Skyrim...
Kind of like how I used to really be into Naruto.
i cant wait for tomorrow
coinflip2, Oh! I don't know ^^:
NOOOOOO DX XD
:[
AJIsAwesome: thats how all fandoms are judged
i love intermission music
*^^;
woah just had a total deja vu moment! O.o
Uuugh. Ads.
Kandarihu: I would go for the original.
dont worry xaiph it wasnt atached to anything
13Kandarihu: l4d1 has legs, doesn't go overboard with the postprocessing effects of 2
OMFG SCOOTALOO EPISODE
Spike will turn big and huge again
Pizza:AJHHHHHHHHHHHH
Bronysith: Well they shouldn't.
TRIXIEBURG!!!
that was wierd
13but 2 has all the campaigns of 1
kdslfjgnlaksjdnaiorwuflkdsncskdbvaewiulefnskdlvnksdfnvs
;o
Bronysith: you mean incorectly?
AJIsAwesome: that would be pesimism, right?
Well the intermission music is pretty calming.
13personally i still say 1 is best
Course I can always see the A tomorrow
PrincessLollipopGear: OK thanks anyway
05,15L4D1 is so much fun.
i thought it was a pegasus with horn but someone then told me
don't worry we can rebuild him
0,5creepy isnt it
DerpAHerpster: get Adblock plus
Shizuka: Actually, L4D2 doesn't
ok they should really play some pony music instead of this jaz lol
return of Spikezilla
Pizza: I'm still alive
But then when his childhood ended, I was done with that stuff.
Do we have the technology?
l4d2 is better i think
Who wants an episode about chickens?
Bronysith: bullshit. some of us still look for the good in things
YAY
I bought the "Pony Power Colelction" mini set at Walmart the other day. So many blindbagsize ponies! :P
SKREEONK
heyo
My OC is flashing red and blue and is an Super Kami Guru-acorn
YESH
i think it was left over from suited for success or something
*craddles Rarity's sink like a lost treasure*
and no the alicorn is not a godmod
Dis musics. also, does Race Rats start soon?
i think i watch POINES
I never got into Naruto.
13oh wait 2 is missing crash course isn't it
Eli: yeah, and since bronysith is a pessimistic hipster, it makes sense
No Lottery???
i always seem to choose vid games and movies set in cold climates and i hate segments in games that have you trek through a desert or rainforest. funny that
This music should be elevator music!
Hey it's that BaconMane :3
But I love jazz.
i like the special infected
a;lkasd
pony_4064: No the jazz is awesome
0,5Its a me
pony_4064: It's not too bad.
I then got really heavy into anime.
im resistant to cold so it doesnt bother me much also the most cold it gets here is 20 degress celsius
yes we can build a better, stronger pizza XD
Minecraft_1997: Lotto'
05,15Shizuka yeah it doesn't have that one
dat BaconMane *nom*
No, L4D2 has crash course
Shizuka: Nope, it isn't actually
lotto is tomorrow
would you believe, that Major (AKA Irish_pony) would pay 50$ for this? http://badponyart.tumblr.com/image/32282101413
feels like i wanna visit the temperate climate countries right now... i wanna experience snowy winter just once in my life :(
LOL
I do! I want an episode about Chickens, and Nightmares!
Kandarihu: I liked L4D2 better, they probably want you to support L4D1 because Value made L4D2 a year after L4D1
All fandoms have their positives and negatives. You need to take the good with bad, and that goes for fandoms as well.
Guess its time to go fap now :'(
why dont they play pony music lo
richfiles: I thought you had all of them by now
oh
I want an episode mainly with big mac :P
cowvarkian: how am i a hipster?
its a thinkin sink
how does the lotty work?
baconmane?
Minecraft_1997: Lotto'stomorrow
I was watching Adult Swim anime when Naruto came around
05,15Wait is has Crash Course?
05,15Really?
/me hugs that BaconMane
What's the deal with the "exploding twice" thing anyways?
Pizza: I'M ALIVE. NOW EAT ME
i love final fantasy 7
Bronysith: thats how
13or is it that lighthouse survival map
i cant be a hipster
TheSplixer72: TMI dude
hey i bought it xaiph cant i nuzzle it
TheSplixer72: have fun ;)
do we really have the technology to do that?
Yep. I have it
Luke, Eeyup
i saw that somewhere else recently
i saw a sleepless in ponyville clip
Has any one ever heard about Wicked City?
cowvarkian: as much as it pains me, it seems to bring it to the point.
I recall playing Crash COurse, I only have 2
*takes a slice*
Shizuka: It's the lighthouse :$
NOMNOMFCKINGNOM XD
Another nightmare moon episode would be epic, true
scarier than sombra
Not me
anyone remember full house
i love final fantasy 7, chrono trigger, coca cola
It's the oldest anime I know of.
lol
13not much of a content advantage over 2
bought? then yes JOIN ME
TheSplixer72: Also, I hope it's just fapping
lol
But the chickens, not so much
*Bon-Bon gets hit by a pizza truck*
The lighthouse for survival is gone, though
and yes
13for me it's the tighter design
Sadly, my area has not had all the waves, and I have been very broke as of late. I can only afford a few ponies hereand there.
Bronysith: that makes my point
0,5pony_4064: ok you should really play some shut the hell up instead of your jaz lol
brony65321: it's from the episode "Feeling Pinkie Keen"
so for the lotto what time does it start?
he paid 50$ for that drawing
132 does way too much postprocessing
brony655321: Spike said it during the episode titled "Feeling Pinkie Keen"
though it was stolen
Let's up the ante.
hey guys, who's perfroming this jazz? i like it
Does L4D1 have the A.I. Director in it? I kind of like that.
I like trains.
The season 3 opener lacked quite a bit in my eyes
50
Bronysith: do you like the glass bottles better?
Of course, what ever happen to the milk man.
yay *hugs*
dollars
05,15This jazz is so smooth
13ja 1 has the director
OohShiny: TheSplixer72: Nah, he's clopping.
I made copies of the TALKING pizza
FUUUUUUUUUUHH XD
Bronysith: Bwahahaha, are you SERIOUS??
yeah guys! stop talking. the show's about to start!
50 dollars, for that shit drawing
OohShiny: It can be whatever you want it to be ;)
Kandarihu: Yes
The jazz is awesome
RaveBrony: yes
It's nice stuff.
13and with only three special infected to throw around i find it's more interesting
ok
gak has more lines than sombra
yaaaayy
Ah
YAY
Oldest anime? pfft, try Astro Boy!
sombra hardly talked
thah shows starting!
Oh my GOD :D
oooo

BOOM BOOM
Disney?
Did he pay up front??
What's this movie about?
wut? :D
yay, awesome movie
yesyes
05,15Does 2 not have the AI director?
Bronysith: Well, that's his fault. Blame him and the person charging for $50 for something like that.
When did that come out?
TheSplixer72: I mean that I hope your not clopping...
Back just in time, it'd seem.
Ah well, time to watch.
admins what was that jazz track?

The villan most u heard from him was AGHH

Why would someone pay money for something like that?
babs was a better threat
*yells* I LOVE CATS

fluttercry: Shizuka: No, I thought they both had the director
moosac
TheSplixer72: And I hope you didn't just flirt with me.

13the director in 2 has more specials to throw around
Oh God.

pffffffft. XD
this is the epicness born when you get all the best comedians together for one purpose
Oh yeah, because focusing on the negative sides of the fandom is totally logical, we totally shouldn't take the positives into effect and make a judgement based on the overall evidence.
Jageman: frozen
totally!
I am gunna be on the lookout for nice cars
fluttercry, iit's good if you like to see where your favorite actors were many years ago in their acting. :>
RATRACE = Its a mad mad mad mad world

Ratrace is named Crazy Race here
It's innocent hollywood comedy.

Buy a squire!!!! people
Colt_Silver this is Rat Race. The B movie for movie night
AJIsAwesome: and thats how haters are made

Hi my pals, I hope you enjoy my movie :)
These credits remind me of Powerpoint presentations from high school. Put slapstick sounds and animations on EVERY GOD DAMNED THING.

Jageman: frozen definitely.

The Enigma's review of RAT RACE: This movie has everything, From start to finish, it's all laughs. The movie is meant to be wacky and to be really taken seriously. I especially love the part when Jon Lovitz looks like Hitler. It's one of the best popcorn comedies of 2001. Just sit back and have fun. 10/10
that's horrible and i wish i never clicked on it...
Stage dive
