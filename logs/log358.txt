13if i were 20% more music minded i would have the notes themselves memorized
13best i can do is go straight to the sliders and solve it from memory
I still have yet to beat Uru, 4 & 5. Its a shame those Myst games are hard to find nowadays.
dammit
13Cypresswolf: Uru Live is free again
I never beat revelations D:
13revelations is ridiculously hard
IKR I remember my family playing it for months and just being like DA FUQ DO I DO?

00,10we all know itues messed up in fact many have knowen for upwards of 9 hours
Greeting Everlasting
emangamer:Ok,But we saw it live!

0,14oh hai everyone
13emangamer... i read a 500 page book in one night
00,10Sup saxy
13coincidentally that was the night i didn't sleep
13or at least i think it was 500 pages... kindle does not say
500 pages
00,10yay
Hey saxy
I wouldn't have the patience to read 500 pages
13don't feel that way
Ever read Romance of the Three Kingdoms? 1300 pages and the best book EVAR!
13look up impostor syndrome and you have me to a tee
I remember reading an entire book in one day in sixth grade.
0,14Hmmm, my CMOA is probably finishing the last Harry Potter book in...5 hours?
5 hours?! Thats fast
/me is most inadequate person here...
(though i did most of that reading during Psychology class...)
13i should take a picture of the great book of amber...
They aint all winners
20% more awesome than the rest of us
^
13the great book of amber, 10 books in one, 1258 pages...
00,10moon gel
13so yeah... i read very very fast
I know the myst topic is an hour old, but did ya'll know there are Myst Books? The Myst Reader, 3 in 1
13myst books are brilliant
Puts alot of history to the games
13but i picked it up in kindle form~<3
13love them soooooooo much
there's been a 4th one announced, but never finished...forget how many years its been now
is there
13didn't something have a sample chapter of marrim?
0,5Well
0,5Goodnight everyone
13was it myst reader or myst 5 that did...
Marrim! Thats it

Goodnight LC
13emangamer: contraction? there's?
0,5Nunights
13nacht LC
/me gives hugs
/me feels really stupid right now

/me gives ALL THE HUGS
/me nods

13yes

13there's been a lot of that lately
/me explodes
13we don't always show ponies
hey
^
13type mismatch
Try again.
maybe not for mods, but for all other ponies it was very enjoyable
its up to those two rarity's :P
^
00,10movies
oh wait... a movie is not a tv show...
the manager wasnt able to give me the signs I wanted
00,10FiM over EE&E
Awe why couldnt they give you the signs?
00,10I did not like that show much
I guess its some sort of contract
13eene was built on slapstick... which did work most of the time, sound effects made it
^
I know that with their signs there are some that a company might want back
dat sextant...
its the same with other companies, I have no idea why but thats just how it goes
Oh I see. Well you made out pretty good though
00,10it had it's moments but then again I saw most the jokes back when the three stooges did it
besides the posters and boxes I also got a bunch of buttons that say DLC available
Why dont you guys do a play through of mincraft!
I've never watched the three stooges is the thing. But I still think I would enjoy EEND more
I have only seen a few episode of three stooges...they were margional at best (when I saw them)
00,10we have done some MC play alongs as well
MTG DotP playthroughs?
/playalongs
13hm..
13the puzzle mode is vaguely interesting
yeah... lets watch a cardgame... >_<
the puzzle mode is fun yes
13i think i still have some sets to do in planeswalkers..
13jaja
damn...I have it for xbox
eventually ill get some console signs, just not at this time
the DLC is pretty entertaining as well
GODDAMMITDARIBOT
Yeah
you would know if it was me
considering my name is eman gmaer
gamer*
Hmm
yo
Accepted it anyway :P
Hi
althought I doubt he knows
Got some skylanders finally
13that reminds me...
:D

I REALLY need to clean my friends list out. Too bad I'm a lazy fat*yay* to do it.
Yup
You have like Everlasting?
live*
I thought arse is a permitted swear?
ahh nice
Ive got cynder
00,10Shizuka heartless?
havent tried her yet though
00,10I want to see a team of sea ponies
Ive seen HTF, years ago though, they still making those?
Oh no, I thought you were, and I was, refering to FB friends.
you had a hard time finding cynder?
Actually ive had a hard time finding any :P quite a few times i looked i couldnt find any
I just like her a lot
I should probably stay up
00,10yay he's geting it
Shes already level 10 and fully upgraded
It's 2300 hrs, but I've been getting up early to do school work, and I've been burning myself out on school work as well.
I had a hard time at first but after a week I saw maybe 10 of em at one store
Shoo Shoo be doo!
13he figured it out
best time to stock up :P
How I haven't snapped yet is beyond me.
13he is mad at me now for pointing out the down arrow :<
SUUURRREEEE he did
Scheming jucies
13did not spoil :<
11,01This is why I don't do well at games like BF3.
I bought all they had that i didnt :P
Maybe it was because you pointed the arrow out on his knee?
11,01Slow thinker.
you mean you bought extras of each figure?
00,10just need to look at the set peices they plaster all ove the walls
No silly
I bought one of eaxh skylander i didnt have
ohh
MY EYES
My eyes!
I only did that for cynder though, she looks awesome
best teacher ever
I can read that, but not the rainbow text
I dont remeber the last HTF that I saw. They were at an amusement park. That's all I remeber
also because a friend of mine couldnt find one
meeeh, you two clearly haven't stared at the sun long enough
She is awesome
:3
How here has played the Sega genesis/mega drive?
I figured she might be collectable in the future
13still had set pieces though
Flutterturrets
13the checkerboards that indicate fling targets for instance
00,10I have the master system
Idk, i mean they sell her like everyone else
did you manage to find the legendary pack from toysrus?
I got that quite awhile ago
I own a model 1 master system!
thats awesome
You didnt get it?
been trying to find it for a long time
no
Lol they had a bunch when i went there
if I could buy a case I would
13portal flash's difficulty is in execution
13because horrendous controls
its still hard
^
I'm probably not aggresive enough
Of course that was awhile ago
Ive never seen it since before thanksgiving
untill the last 5 puzzles...then there is actually some genuenly difficult puzzles
I havnt either i suppose, glad i got it when i did
yeah
have you played mirrors edge?
^
I plan to buy the whole shelf if I see them
13played the demo
^
Lol
13first person platforming
Me too
damn thing is impossible to find
it doesnt worrent more than a rent though
And yes I've played the Mirrior's Edge.
I bet
I agree with Yahtzee. A failed experiment.
13narbacular drop was fun
Exterminate!
13tag the power of paint is fun too
I cant wait for the next two bonus adventure packs
I heard tag was fun
One of them has sparx :3
00,10yep
13tag is amazing
oh?
/me got the full SCV OST today
Yup
yeah that ones also going to be popular
00,10glad they got the gel idea from tag
maby i'm biased about mirrors edge, i downloaded it (this was pre money, i can afford some games now), might have hated it if i paied its $110 retail price
I just rmember two of my friends having 1v1 matches and listening/watching to them fight and rage at eachother. Good times...
I prefer the SNES version of Shadowrun
australia?
13take a limited set of pieces and scatter them in such a way that you figure out how they go together
Good luck baby
at least not factoring in conversion between USD $ and whatever you use as a currency there
i killed those turrets by picking up the ball and throwing it at them
Have you heard about the "sequal" yet?
i died in the process but it wa worth it
13communication ist more than chat~
Six-siders.
yeah
0,14so who's streaming/playing atm?
saw it on the darkspyro website
00,10I take it neather one of them has mics
Why not?

I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Alrighty
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
0,14*flute*

Vegemite. Ew.

0,14I want to try vegemite
I think I'll go too folks. I need to get up early enough. Ugh. . .
/me remembers this level

<3 Airplane
ypu
0,14yep
yup'
13aaaaairplane
0,14I can't wait for those movies
13will be a good night
i misspelt 'yup' twice
0,14I've seen Airplane quite a bit
13i haven't seen airplane in ages
0,14never seen Top Scecret, but I've hear of it
oh look, a button
00,10use the funnle and the lazor
can you do that? can you misspell twice?
00,10lazor swaps funnle direction
dafaq is that sound? its like scratching, happens every 10-20 minutes and seems
Yes, you can misspell twice. I've even does it 4 times.
0,14Airplane used to be my A pick
0,14until I decided we need more westerns in here
00,10clue all the way
its not like it matters that much anyway
3Night ponies! I'll be heading out now
now?
Entertaining movies are entertaining. That's all that matters
/me dreams of doughnuts
^
00,10swap rolls guys
the valve comentaries are very good
weeee!
loop
L4D2 commentary was just ok
I think anyway
at least you got the button
^
mine crashed about 3/4 the way through
00,10load chapters in comentary mode
13^ closest you get
i know but still
00,10one of you work the lazor the othere work the funnle
11,01Trying to do that.
Not an easy room
13once you know how it works...
Lol
oh, i just figured it
11,01We need to get someone into the funnel.
easy, want to know how?
Or GabeM I should say
13normalmap ALL the things!
13it's the valve way!
12o-o
is it bump or normal? i think both could produce that effect
12night all
00,10ok use the lazor now
13i think it's interchangeable
13something about light bouncing off a surface normal or some 3D jargon like that
00,10......
got it
00,10save for the part where nitt did not use the lazor
13then there's also parallax map which is like bump map +2
13saw that coming
hemoth2012
normal maps and bump maps are used instead of the normal geometry when you do lighting
damn typo
0,14...so...cold

It's still somewhere :3
that's crazy, you can't handle all that silliness

04XD
10,02You’ve got to be kidding me. I’ve been further even more decided to use even go need to do look more as anyone can. Can you really be far even as decided half as much to use go wish for that? My guess is that when one really been far even as decided once to use even go want, it is then that he has really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like. It’s
10,2just common sense
dat common sense
You've got it copied/pasted from somewhere..

04And we'll see if we can come to a compromise.
well as I said
that head
That is amazing
04like "ZOMG PURE ENERGY"
06that intro with one-shotting a helicopter makes me
04XD
Rhy only really has 2 laser weapons
and yes that was terrible
If a little off-model?
I cringe at myself
06also
06>4x zoom
06>close quarters
Yeah.. can't make 'em quite like the animation..
2/3/whatever
06but it's at least somewhat viable
I R POOR
People still pay 300+ for them.
044x zoom.
heh
well Draaaaaaake
/me should research that
06well laser weapons that are like prototypes are often kinda interesting, and 2060 would be a suitable time for that kind of thing to be around JUST SAYING
you know the hidden blade in Assassin's Creed?
04yes
06But no like
Rhy has those but sorta laser versions
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLsLlDHUYqw&feature=player_embedded
and also a laser sword
06fully auto star wars laser blasters
04well
I just saw that one
04Is the blade completely plasma/laser?
04Or does it incorporate some sort of projector
04like
04A frame, then laser/plasma edges?
i know right?
/me sketches something quickly
Center needle/spike
06now I'm wondering how such a weapon would even work
Well
a central blade
that projects energy around itself when activated
though Rhy may use it without the energy
06Oh that makes more sense
r moderators bad people or is that a sterotype?
06Because the Star Wars ones just makes me go HOW DO I MAKE A LASER ONLY GO THIS AND THAT FAR AND THEN STOP but >sci-fi
they're horrible.
13who ist saying we are bad people :<

I am

if you need a precise colour
04EXACTLY XELI
it'd be like Anakin's blue lightsaber

04...Sure that works
i is from CT liek a bau5
/me calls for group hug
XD
10,02That names Bond...Ionic Bond...Taken, not shared.
well
if Rhy needs to be stealthy
.....brilliant
Do you have a joke on Sodium? Na...
since it's still usable without
10,02O U
but it's far more potent with
Ikr?
I..I listened to MLD well the reading...
wat do mods do at night (that wasnt sexual)
saxy music.
nao
K I'm in Australia
04Like instead of locking blades you'd melt right through it
ikr?
04Or cutting a hole through a door/wall
yeah
Tell a Ytrium joke. Y?
We should take all these bad jokes and just Barium.
don't want to overpower it
06A laser blade IS overpowered, but at the same time it's instadeath if you fuck up and hit yourself
06therefore it's balanced
/me hides
lmao
das a sad combination
I know!
Take this. You'll die of dehydration from manly tears.
/me cries
Umm I'm sad too y'know
Wait, you regret reading MLD?
04kaboom
My grandma passed away two weeks ago
04Or they'd both shortcircuit or something
I regret nothing!
it's not exactly electricity
No I don't regret it I just regret crying again
06and I hope you don't plan on blocking boolets or something with it
But it's hard not to.
boolets?
06bullets
06:po
I'm fine
06GOOD
Thanks guys
XD
xD
04ACOG goes from 1.5x to 6x
04Hmm

lmao
04What would be ideal for close-quarters combat with a single shot rifle?
04XD
Did anyone pick up the pun in Avatar?
Yeah, no worries :3
Unobtanium?
Rhy's hidden blades?
04What level of magnification?
they can't cut through walls
unless you think that's okay
04also
04http://i40.tinypic.com/1zgdufp.jpg
I don't like these jokes. I'm not getting any reactions.
04Red dot scopes look weird
I'm okay now.
ba dum tuss.
04But I'll think about it
O U
04I don't want to go on the CoD wiki, that's all. Probably not all that accurate
hehe
wut.
Oh goodness
06But a single shot rifle should probably stick to mid range anyway
06And that's the most logical approach to an energy weapon I've seen in a while :p
wut?
06at least a melee-kind of one.
Just saw this on T.V: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIPq6Ouw0KY
well
04yeah, same
06not LOL MAGICAL LASER STOPPING FOR NO REASON
04I actuallylike it
06lazor dagger
04And NS, no swords
it's more like daggers rather than swords
04of any kind
):
/me takes a long walk to ponder things
Night
04No longer than a 30cm ruler
gnight
dat 64 ping
well
it wouldn't be that long
i'm back, now with more ipv6 :3
lol
cya
06And yeah dagger length then
otherwise it'd limit movement
04Eh, that works
10,02I wanna hug you now :3
04lol Espeon
04http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Tasco_PDP2.jpg
04I can live with that scope
:)
it's roughly around 20cm probably
wubs
/me looks for a ruler
06fair nuff
wat do mods do
Why hug his back?
04I just don't want a circle instead of a dot
04I need a dot, not a circle for the reticle
My curiosity says I need to watch the leak episode
XD
okay it's roughly 30cm
10,02We also help out with the website and its many functions behind the scenes
04that'll do then
soo no clopping??
maybe a tiny bit longer but it's still a dagger
DONT
04Yeah, that's fine
maybe Rhy would have a reverse dagger too
Must...stay...away...from leaked...episode!
Wait for Saturday
:(

there seems to be some kind of seafood rollign around
one that comes out from her elbow instead of her wrists
SHH
and then it exploded
twice
13two levels left
I aint gonna
Octorock
because the entry point of the retractable dagger is from around the top of her wrists, coming out over her hands
04uh
/me fights off leaked episode
exactly
04Why would they come out from her elbows
neat
Back I say back!
06ADAM JENSEN
for a different fighting perspective
13BURRITO TIME
10,02:<
04Also Rhy would have to be really careful with that laser dagger and her hand
Ole!
Rhy knows how to manage it
Where's my Manwich?

or how about the dagger can move both forwards and backwards
Favorite quote: Shoot First ask questions later
/me has to admit that he did have proper mexican food until he went to the US
though that could be overpowered
dunno though
I don't even like stew.
04Hmm
04I guess she'd change weapons based on the current mission
Rhy is far too lazy
04She can have a collection of different CQC weapons

04which rifle
I know
Welcome to bronyhood, my friend
xD
I just thought of Rhy as Larxene-like
04I guess Nathan would go into combat with either his ACR or his sniper
04LOL
/me doesn't get the corgette kebabs
04Larxene lol
Whoa
xD
they're pretty similar
Woow, roaches :O
AHHHH WTB????
LOL
If you do that, do it to someone else too
:3
see!
makes no sense
06Compensating?

Ok
10,02'Goes to check mail, sees mailman still there...goes back inside'

PURPLE!
13okay now this level i need help on...
xD
13cause i never remember
and then every thing exploded?
lol
brb gotta finish HW
06No kill like overkill.
Take care
lmao
13as soon as i get tehre..
04But then I figure Nathan would go fir the legs
brace yourselves
04Since aversion to killing
bad joke incoming
I don't think Rhy would mind killing
Uh-oh
Oh noes...
06good idea
OH NOSE!
lmao
10,02MahBoi777: O U
06"I didn't kill them, the bleeding did!"

http://i44.tinypic.com/fa50g1.png Ha ha!
Rhy has twin retractable energy/laser/plasma/whatever daggers that can move out either from her elbow or wrist
13faaaaaaaaail
10,02:P
and maybe a few throwing daggers/spare knives
:D
no seriously I'll brb
no that's lame
ahem
anyway
You need help on the level, or you need help to get at the start of the level?
He's not coming back, is he
she hates guns
LOL
any suggestions for a gun for her to carry?
04XD
since she'll probably have to carry one anyway
13this level is a real puzzla
04Some kind of sidearm?
well
04A handgun of some kind
he'll be back.....they all come back
04Machine pistol?

LOL
light leather armour at least
or at least on her arms

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
06:ohdear:
not sure what'd suit her
leather's probably best for her type of character
since generally being hit by punches which may or may not be backed by SAP gloves hurt like shit
School bitches.
and can cause internal bleeding
School bitches.
04GODDAMNIT
[20:23:32] <~Armageddon> not sure what'd suit her
[20:24:18] <~Armageddon> leather's probably best for her type of character
[20:24:42] <~Armageddon> since generally being hit by punches which may or may not be backed by SAP gloves hurt like shit
[20:24:46] <~Armageddon> and can cause internal bleeding
04h-uh
04Well, dress Rhy in whatever would suit her for CQC mostly
04Since it's her strong point she'd focus on that
04Nathan, he'd rely more on practicality and staying in one place.
04So lightweight (snipers are HEAVY)
04!delgreet
Well
Rhy's speed is her strong point
18
04hits*
but prefers not to
she relies more on her speed rather than strenght
strength
10,02'Happy Birthday!' 'You too!'
though she normally varies her tactics depending on the situation
she's used to fighting multiple enemies at once
which requires speed more than strength
10,02Then it's Tuesday.
xD
04ah
04and fuck, I should be finishing that story
04And we still haven't sorted out Leo's skills
yeah
/me slaps Xeli
Apr 26 21:10:46 <~Armageddon> well
Apr 26 21:10:48 <Drake> You'd be the tech specialist.
04ah
That's all?
04Well
well
<Drake> You are the tech specialist and close quarters combat specialist.
04explosives specialist

watermelon good or bad?
04bomb disposal
Apr 26 21:12:14 <Drake> I'm the marksman and saboteur.
Apr 26 21:12:55 <Drake> Xeli can maybe be the demolitions expert, espionage specialist and the all-rounder.
06well that'd be fine but would benefit from somewhat other weaponry then
06and yes
XD
06they come in handy
these are automatically saved
I'm going to Kiddie Land!
10,02Who wants to help me with a homework problem?
Hmm...
We all can, if we know
Ask away
I can try
10,02Nvm, can't copy and paste.
13so
10,02FAAAAAAAAAAAIL
I think Rhy needs some other weapons
Possessed die.
dat drop can do anything
04a baton?
04Machine pistol?
04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_pistol
04maybe an uzi, NS?
10,02You did it :D
o_O
04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzi
13hmm
close combat
04You said longer-ranged
longer
not long
13going to see if this notebook has my notes ><
06http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_knife
HAI EVERYPONY I IS BACK!!!
than her daggers
/me hides
04Well there isn't much she can
04LOL XELI
Oh hey Kipkat I didn't hear you there :3
lol
04Yet it's an actual weapon
do mods ever leave a room unmonitored or do they work in shifts?
Yes.^
04I dunno NS
I think that suits Rhy
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QerOwpd3WBc
mods do all sleep sometimes
13well... crap... none of these notebooks has it...
dunno
04That's basically a baton
Rhy's skilled enough to be able to beat pretty much all opponents at close combat
yeah
but longer
o
has anyone seen SHED.MOV
we can't discuss that
:(
I havent seen that yet.
yeaaaaa
srry
04I guess a staff/baton that's retractable could work
SHED.MOV? another episode?:(
hm
?
04http://i39.tinypic.com/4rarm1.jpg
13yay
04when we talk about guns
10,02Yay!
lmfao
ESPLOSIN
13and finally!
inb4Boss
04http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/NIMcase444ACRtest.jpg
06lol
huzzah
04The one on the bottom
Well anyway
Rhy'll have her primary laser/energy/plasma daggers
Credits?
04The one above it is also pretty cool
Why is it named Level 15 then?
06all-round and between long and close range
some lightweight throwing knives
06http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMI_Tavor_TAR-21 that :P
06Aaaand brb
and also some ballistic knives probably
04shit
04nice gun
just cause
nice
lmao
04XD
Anyway
06and I am consciously looking for kinda
04It also has semi-automatic, burst and automatic
06future--looking ones
Rhy is a mostly CQC + knives person
04so it's basically for everything
hates guns
only uses them if she has too
besides, she's terrible at aiming with handguns
Please elaborate?
Also, you win the credits
but she's pretty good at turrets/cannons/weapons on planes/jets/aircraft
Easiest level=Level 15
Oh.
06Leo's "CQC" should be summed up with "Revolver"
13and that's all for me ponies~
06and this sure became
06brainstormy
D:
XD
:'(:'(:'(
do not cry mai friend
But... we liked you...
And, admire Cathedral Zero
Rhy isn't the sort of "stab anywhere" person, she aims for points to hit and usually hits them hard
YES
AW YEA
she might take some time to take down a single enemy if they're good, but it's usually because she's carefully calculating how to kill them
or decapitate them
Dat Why are you here?
because ponies
04decapitate
I saw this in a movie
04so much for trauma
10,02PONIEZ
I can't go home
I'm already here
Why am I here? Why are we all here? Why do we live?
/me headdesks
Well
Is it really worth it?
Rhy isn't as affected as Nathan is
Oh MAN
aliens man, just aliens
ME GUSTA
and I suppose you could have Nathan normally tell her to "stop aiming for the neck"
13one of the earlier bomber missions kept crashing on stream too
Dat RD
and suddenly sax1
06>decapitate
06>dagger
awwww yeaa, lol
:O
06unless the energy thing of course
06NECKS ARE STURDY OKAY
<3<3<3
Is she coming closer to the screen?
LOL
WHAIO
10,02LOL
04That could be a point of conflict between then
OH
because people use guns and they're steel
Dat Trixie :O
ikr?
04Nathan is opposed to killing, whereas Rhy has a less stiff view on killing
well
YES!
/me runs
SUCCESS
suddenly trixie
lmao
But I'm backing away from the screen. Does that mean I'm moving closer negatively?
04Nathan would constantly be thinking "They're just doing their job, like us. Why should I kill them when they probably have friends just like me?"
Rhy wouldn't think that at all really
She might give some thought
but she won't dwell on it
haha
this sax music is great
10,02:>
Leo's in-between
GAH
suddenly
06even though as I said, he's not a psycopath or anything he just
Leo's like the balance of Rhy and Nathan
yeah
time for de magiks
macdonalds in the netherlands have ponies now
naaaaaaaauuuuughty
lmao
/me hides
lmao
04XD
04wynaut
XD
04he's the one that stops us from failing constantly
well
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee:O
10,02:3
I'm okay with this strangely
My mind says run away, but my body
04And why
As much as Rhy is "kill or be killed"
mfw no zoom
says DASH
04why can't I get the image of SOlid Snake out of my head
Y U NO ZOOM
Radu: it is
oh
she doesn't enjoy killing
see
GAAAAAAAAH
lmao
eeeeeeeeeee:O:'(
04So she's like, "I kill but I don't necessarily enjoy it"
yeah
Lesson Zero is tooooooo overrated
10,02FYI: This is Zelda music
She's like Seran except without the sadist bit
ummmmm...
When I first went to the scary part of Ancient Cistern, I was like, WHOA
heh
06well it might make sense that he picks something where
06he doesnt have to get up close and personal
/me stares into it like a baws
06for his own sake
do you take requests?
is it that time again?
Look out!
OH NO
Well Rhy normally nearly kills herself by jumping from level to level and usually she only survives because she lands on someone else
Also, song to look up?
Fall back!
or there's something to break her fall
and Nathan is usually pissed about that
retreat
OH SHI
06lol
also, grappling hooks?
Run away
now
04urgh
helloooooo
06IMPROVISE

04This needs to happen more often

yeah
04Other than codenames, not really
04No point.

10,02Simon ;____;
no u isnt u is a good pony
SIMONNNNNNN
10,02D:
04true
dat Drop it
we should have personal fighters
04No
04Just
04no
):
xD
04Overkill
04You can be the pilot, sure
fiiiiine
04But not personal aircraft
we'd have loads of money
04The company is rich, but not THAT rich
Missle Launcher is the best weapon ever in Sains Row
or at least the company would
well
dat Fluttermeow
they'd have to have fighters
lol, thot this was one man band for a second
04A single aircraft per team
yeah
shark gun try again
04Plus a pilot if necessary, which it isn't
or at least a shuttle + fighter
YEAH!!!
since shuttles are no use for dogfights
04mmm
04Helicopters as well
dis is exercise music
they lack manoeuvrability
wel
well
04but they're more used for local operations
shuttles or helicopters
personally I'd go for shuttles
its a 80's remix with becoming popular
since they're faster and quieter
You spelled Rarity wrong :3
but helicopters are generally associated with these sorts of things anyway
and shuttles might be a bit advanced
its not mine
04yeah
is everyone dancing!! \^.^/
04By "Shuttles" do you mean something like
fighters should be fine
04a plane that can hover?
yep
mfw I missed Twilight and RD at McDonald's :(
yeah
well
shuttles, literally
i have them Radu
if you really need an example
think of the star wars shuttles
04like this
04http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/D77H-TCI_Pelican
04Oh
04Yeah
04A bit too advanced
06so like
mfw=my face when
now just need Rarity and Fluttershy
06harriers
bit advanced
ooooo
I'd say helis still
OH thanks Radu
/me glomps Radu
04I was thinking Ospreys
/me is glomped
but one of you would have to be able to drive it as wel
well
ikr?
since if Rhy goes in a fighter on a mission
04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Boeing_V-22_Osprey
04A plane, but also a helicopter
nice
/me glomps #bronystate
well
@pony
Hey boi
04yeah, but they can work with getting people into position
04Plus, planes mean you'd need to parachute
04Which, on a clear day or night, is rather revealing
he ded
HAHA
Uhoh
yeah
I used to
^Indeed
well
play this plzzzz: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UB9ELCC-kM&feature=g-like&context=G24a3e12ALTzOBwAA4AA
do you still play it?
or the fighter
whatever
nah, not anymore
total miner forge
04Used for parachuting during cloudy days/nights of when fast deployment is needed
04Also airstrikes
04Like
My body says no
same
YOUNG MAN! There's no need to feel down, I said YOUNG MAN! Get yourself up the ground, I said YOUNG MAN!
leave return leave return. i cant seem to stay in one place
I've heard that song somewhere!
well
that's it!
the fighter is sorta a one person one
designed for aerial combat
Dat !!!
aka dogfights
04Doesn't mean it can't be outfitted for bombing
it's an escort craft for the heli
good to see you online, where you been
Hey! Listen!
well yeah it'd have bombing
04Or even just a machinegun for anti-personnel
but wouldn't be for parachuting
04Because you don't want to blow us up do you?
He is aFk

Nopony is getting gobbled today
The movie that he starred in
"Maybe I actually am the anti-christ?!" http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/203/685/conspiracy-keanu.jpg?1321901003
I'm not actualy sure If I've seen that movie, which is it?
devil's advocate
actually i think his incestruious son is the anti-christ but close enough
It's still early in the day
Not that many people are on yet
Greetings
I might as well ask again
you'd have to ask whoever is streaming that day
Well I think I am going to continue to work on coloring in my drawing
The Dovahcore helmet, what's that?
Afternoon any and everypony.
hello
Had a feeling it'd be rather uncrowded at this hour.
Yeah, usualy is quiet at these times
I heard, not goint to watch it though before saturday
i olny heard the song
There's a song?
only*
My week is looking up.
yup
You have no idea how fun that is.
You must. YOU MUST!
You must...
ok I'm back
i want to watch it now but i dont want to watch it now
Just remember to not spoil anything.
Or feel the ever present wrath of the banhammer.
Whenever I see the word "banhammer", I can't help of thinking about Doomhammer from the Warcraft universe.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDzZH54-nao&feature=channel_video_title
Seeing the word Doomhammer made me think about Orgrim Doomhammer from Warcraft.
banhammer AKA HAMER OF DAWN
kto polaks?
That and brown.
I think the Banhammer should be renamed to Mjölnir
the Sword of a 1000 bans
Yeah but Mjolnir has it's own place in stories.
Please rate this music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDzZH54-nao&feature=channel_video_title

One does not simply care about random..Finnish? Polish? news shows.

Such is the way or lurkers you mean.
Hey everypony just wanted to drop by and see what's going on.
Hide the porn!
Hi Toy
Nothing much. Et tu?
Got school :(
going to play some TF2
I like school.
It has BOOKS.
I used to play TF2
I NEED MORE BOOKS.
then you took a RAINBOW in the knee?
Actually I just gradually stopped playing it.
I should go now bye guys lol
Pony is best excuse.
Haha
Did you ask them all Kammer?
Hi everypony
That'd be a lie, of course. Twilight would scold me mentally if I didn't do my homework.
PResumably they have work emails, send them episode links.
Everyone! I bring news thaat yoy may or may not have heard!
I did, however, do essays taking place in Equestria.
yah
DO NOT WANT
^
You can't run into spoilers if you stand still.
I don't want to stand still though
XD
No!
er 1 day XD
Which is one of the reasons I'm not active in #bronystate or one of the Mane 6 rooms on Saturdays.
Or BMN, for that matter.
Ikr Kammer.
Hide.
Smooth job.
I eat it at mornings.
why dont the other rooms work?
They are disabled
The mane 6 rooms are now only used during Mane Showings.
They only work during the Saturday streams now
why?
Something about not having enough mods
cause they lack mods
oh.....ok
:)
It's cozy. You'll like it.
Play with this.
Did mine already.
Good luck
I suddenly realised I haven't eaten all day.
I GO. -Briefly, to aquire consumables.
You shall abscond!
Apparently, I still have an essay to do.
letter scale*, even.
There's a protest for that now?
It warms the cockles of my heart.
Oh yeah, plenty of them.
Implying I do?
Well, civil wars are no fun without guns.
Untrue, think of the room for creativity.
...Arson?
-_-
You are the least imaginative person ever.
I hear that a lot.
:P
I know that feel, man.
It's all because of my two screens.
I wanna duel someone here
You just don't move someones icons.
Do ponies know how to duel?
With a rapier?
In my headcanon, Luna fences
is that close enough?
Does she look like gagaga girl?
Shmucks*
are for shmucks* ?
Not really
They kinda died after the season they arrived
But still. I stopped caring about card games around the time GX came out.
Then you missed all the good cards
I never got into Yu-Gi-Oh. I was more of a Magic the Gathering type
I forget the name but there was a card recently added that negates the effects of other monsters, spells and traps as soon as it's summoned.
Heheh...plot
Plot
Speaking of plot, Pulp Fiction is rather confusing.
Right, i run ninjas now.
NINJAS!
YGO
I'm talking about it
NINJAS

There's a leaked episode, do not want
spoilers abound
Rarity. Is. A. LADY.
I already watched the episode
Not the best
But ok
well many of us haven't
heard about the leak. dont want spoilers.
Infact, dont even visit the post about the leak!
And i think the post on EQD was deleted
I havent & I wont until it officaily airs saturday

on ED right now, and its still there
yeah, that post is still there too
Entire ep

yeah, it got on iTunes yesterday somehow
the whole 22 minutes...I ddint watch any of it, just checked to varify truth
They did it
They may claim accident, but i call crap.
I feel they did that on purpose
I would have thought they wouldn't post that due to the whole derpy thing
is it still on itunes or did they remove it?
people that hate on derpy must die
Well… (nope. no spoilers)

Curiosity
Lions and tigers, seaturtles, endangered wildlife, lion cubs. You can work with one, which would it be?
ummm
Well, I frequent /b/, where ponythreads were just beginning to become popular.
my bronization was at Battlefield Hero's forum
A friend of mine showed me the show, and I got hooked!
i watched their memes..
found it on tv XD
i decided to watch 1 Episode
Safe to say, I was not.
Did he like it, globe?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PtMPOyWTag&feature=related
I didn't get halfway through the first episode before realising that "Holy bit, this show is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!"
did any one else just figure out that the voice actor for Pinkie Pie is also Fluttershy's?
I rmr the first eps. I watched was Hearth's Warming Eve
same
:(
then watched more Episodes
Can anyone else not stand pony puns?
finished Season 1
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3qJA2oBy-0&feature=related
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc9JyGK0qCI
i finish season 1 in one day
can stand a world of pain for the sake of this fandom.
I watched the two first episodes with my friend. I acted like I wasn't that impressed by the show at first, but later that night when I got home, I stayed up to 8 am watching the episodes.
And I loved it
