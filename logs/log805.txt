Wrek: any chance you stream Pulse again ?
how've you been cachi01|phone
hey just tuned in to this stream and what band is this? it's exactly my type of music
I'm sure 5000000 people have asked this but what movie is playing tonight?
Fine thx :) how bout u?
Gladiator and Mars Attacks
Ugh i need a coffee someone make one for me
nice! ty ekips
05ekips did that the other day
here yah go
Can't wait for the lottery and Mars Attacks.
thanks^
I don't like Gladiator much.
I always miss the most awesome things :/
better
05ekips: got 1 more sabaton concert planned after this
sabator i guess?
05aswell as if tiem allows, a very good mark knopfler live show
I <3 the Gladiator
Sign my float! Sign my float!
I guess the chant says sabaton
To me, Gladiator is one of Ridley Scott's weaker films. Not bad, but below par for a man of his genius.
I have watched exactly one scene of Gladiator
its ok
so I'm eager to see it tonight or tomorrow
its wierd i never saw the avangers.
PRIMO VICTORIA
This song <3.
oh wow
/me jumps along
lol
I much prefer Alien, Blade Runner: Final Cut and Thelma & Louise.
more POWER!
is here a marathon ?
Tjose are Ridley Scott's best.
*Those
05pony_362: not yet, right now its concerto hour(s)
I just find Gladiator to be overrated action fluff.
Not that there's anything wrong with action fluff. It's why I love the Transformers films.
im fine with concerts,too^^
Alien...... We all loved alien until they fucked up with the weird shitty sequels
...
Alien and aliens are good
cachi01|phone come on, they are not so bad...
aliens is good :)
I don't know. Aliens was pretty damn good.
Aliens was awesome
I keep smelling gas...like from a lighter in my room...
turn it off than
Im talkim bout 3 and 4 ( i forgot the names of those fanfics)
Drew: You might want to leave and have that looked at.
aliens best movie in series

and then there was silence
CTHULHU: We're trying to enjoy the song.
and?
CTHULHU: So we remain silent.

twilight_sprinkle: Nice way of fooling the censor.
You know, I love Sabaton, but seriously, how many songs can you make about WWII?
Bilderbergs, Skull and Bones, Masons etc. etc.
I'm watching some MST3K. I gotta keep in mind that it's not on the stream.
dat rd
He looks like he's having so much fun :).
<3
Woah CTHULHU, no r34 here, even if it's "clean"
They always do Everlasting_Joy :3
>.>
It's a rock concert. They are required to have fun by law.
LadyCanary: True, true :).
Is someone posting ponies while Mods are AWAKE? :[
Metal :|
of course
Record_Discord: I don't think you understand what r34 is.
05not all their songs are about WWII
05in fact
05latest album is about 1600's sweden
Meanwhile: Don't talk to me about rule 34. I KNOW ABOUT RULE 34
what else
who is this...?
Meanwhile: I just mean suggestive
Sabaton :3
Shocking
Meanwhile, let him have his fun~
Record_Discord: It can't really be r34 and 'clean'
Wrek: You weren't kidding when you said these guys are the best way to learn about history.
Meanwhile: BUT IT CAN
GAAAAAAY Division~
If you wanna see a really energetic rock band concert, watch any given concert with JAM Project. Masaaki Endoh, Hironobu Kageyama and Ricardo Cruz actually compete on stage to see who can be the hammiest.
sabaton is the best swedish band. of course there's better bands in the neighbouring countries
but still rather good
Record_Discord: But...not really.
JAM Project is made of hot-blood and animes
Record_Discord: r34 = porn.... so no
cowvarkian: Hey brah
ohai there
Purple`Prose: A-faucking-men
05oh look LadyCanary
FINE. I am making a FORMAL apology. I meant suggestive.
05he has his new vest in this one
:3333
05with new ornaments
they have tyranny here, i got kicked even for context :c
<3
05ratehr than standard non slippery plate
Wrek: you're a new ornament
In fact, I would watch a JAM Project anime.
Wrek, you're the best because you feed my love of this man :|
Purple`Prose: That would be the best anime ever.
YES!
This song!
Giant robots powered my the power of JAM Project's music.
05i hate the shit audio on these rips

Now Im reminded of this one episode of Ren & Stimpy that gave a new meaning to the word hand job. :X
:'( i...i missed that ........
I recently picked up one of my favorite childhood cartoons, Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree, at a pawn shop for a dollar. Watching it made me cry so many nostalgia tears.
ouo: So that's what the B stands for
i'm back from the doc
Scarecrow and Wicked Symphony are my favorites.
ouo: I love that pic.
Record_Discord: ikr
Record_Discord: Yes.
I grew up on Pooh
cowvarkian: I guess we're all getting childhood/nostalgia boners around here.
this is a gifferent local
05dammit sabaton
Record_Discord: this is true
Pretty much, Record_Discord.
05gief newer songs!
05i want livstid i krig!
Are we talking about the old Pooh, which looked like hand-drawn pictures?
Purple`Prose: Yeah
Yes, we are.
Purple`Prose: is there a different one?
I vote for Long Live the King Wreky
cowvarkian: Yeah, fuckin'... 3d.
The last Pooh thing that came out that actually felt like Pooh was The New Adventures TV series.
Record_Discord: oh yeah...
Yup.
indeed
Ooooh :3
I have some Winnie the Pooh blankets. Still use them. Had them since I was two. Not sure why.
Inb4 english version
/me is jumping to the music.
moshpit time
yes
:O
OMG
YES
SQUANKEE!!
Record_Discord: lawl
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT
ouo: I know right? I haven't the heart to get rid of them.
OMG
This is AMAZING.
>_ >
I am developing a love of old shooters. Hey guys :P
Socks: you mean the games, or the people
Heya Socks! :)
like, people who shoot old guys, or old guys who are shooters?
Socks: Have you played Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition. I like squishing the aliens underneath dorrs and watching them stretch.
Socks: dunno how old you're talking, but counter-strike 1.6 is one of the classics
cowvarkian: I mean the games, Doom, Quake, Unreal Tournament that sort of thing, they have a real charm to them
looks like ladycanary is enjoying this concert
Record_Discord: It's fantastic.
Socks: I know, just the way you phrased it made it fun
to make fun of
:P
05Socks: i dare you to beat all the original doom wads on ultraviolence withotu strafign ;)
Oh God, Ultraviolence mode.
Wrek: You are a cruel man O.O
05Socks: ive done it on stream
05beat all of em
05soem maybe remember it
Ultraviolence mode is a BITCH.
WOOOOOO
I remember that
YAAAAAAAAY
Yeah yeah I'm a bad gamer ¬_¬
/me feels bad for himself
Well, at least it isn't Nightmare mode.
gaming is a learnable skill
/me feels bad for socks
/me feels bad for Record_Discord
that's one big lighter
Sing light satan and carry a big lighter.
Nightmare mode is literally impossible.
That means 2 things :3
like*
/me feels bad for cowvarkian
Grassenmetal
05nightmare mode is unbeatable in the mean that you cant beat it in the same manner as you would other difficulties
05onyl way to beat it is to rush it
Wrek: And even then, it's only through miracle that you'd reach the end of level one.
My dad used to play doom but then my mum made him stop after I was born :P
hah
/me is reminded of the Metal Goddess Luna tumblr now
Socks: Your mom sucks.
fanfic break bbl.
Socks: :(.
Socks: Ever try Nerf Arena Blast? That shit was a kids game based off of the Unreal Engine.
Record_Discord: I'll check it out
Socks: It DEFINED my childhood and made me love FPSs.
My dad raised me on stuff like Tremors, Terminator and Species 2.
whom is this?
Sabaton
Get off the ground!
Gamingwise I was raised on the Age of Empire games, the first shooter I played was TF2
....I was in a good mood today until I made the mistake of listening to the news
05CriticKitten
Mind you, it's been YEARS since I last saw Tremors.
CriticKitten: SHHHHHH
05befoe you continue
No, not gonna continue.
05a ton of people already brought it up
CriticKitten: Aye, that'll bring some bad things.
05i dont want more pointless discussing here
...did i miss something?
Wrek: what was already brought up
I didn't plan to.
Nope
What was brought up?
Dark_Horst: Look up Connecticut Shooting. Then don't discuss it.
:X
ah
Nothing. We dropped it.
/me leaves chat for a while until things stop being depressing
so, never
Again, I didn't plan to. >_> I was just stating that my mood's shot.
Never

Oh god, no. :(

They played Ghost Division earlier, Kelbor
Awww

Wrek: Yep :), when they said it was the name of their album, I find it appropriate they use that line.

Socks, they got a instrument called a hurdygurdy. That is enough reason to listen to them. Trust me.
Really Kelbor? :3 Do tell, do you like Death? (band) :3
cachi01|phone: i did, and it was like 5 minutes
What band is this? :(
Kelbor: hurdy gurdy is best instrument
no no , yes
Dear Princess Wrek, the most beautiful in BronyState, as you seem to be stuck on banning me, I insist that this is something that needn't be done. I will no longer post the overly smily face in chat. I send my most formal apologies to your beautiful palace in Administrator Heaven. Your faithful student, Record_Discord.
...
Death? I know of them but I do not listen to them, sadly, M'lady.
the hurdygurdy? this is now amazing and I haven't listened to a single song!

U know the people of Iran actually like the USA. Its just the govt that is made of assholes.
Sumica: i see what you did there
hehe... "log"
TheGentleManBrony: almsot all governments are
Well, I'm back from MST3K
TheGentleManBrony, I'm totally aware of that.
Kandarihu it seems you're the only one.
Or I just haven't looked hard enough.
Idk
i read that iranians are pretty pissed with their government
Sumica I cant quite draw your kirt properly XD i drew you to short of your mini will be a ultra micro XDDDD
their latest stunt: banned battlenet ips
ha
that mouse
On a similar note, I'm really hoping that not all Arabs are intolerant sexist assholes.

I've heard about the hyperinflation protests. I swear, the day the Ayatollah goes down will be a new beginning for Iran.
well, one of the reasons battlenet got banned is bacause wow promoted slutty outfits and immoral depictions of females
<---- Yet USa wants to f'ck over internet
think about that one
:P
so their government is, at least
longest APP add ever
conservative maniacs in positions od power
has the young generation pissed
what are we watching O.O
Choo Choo Sucka? Does this guy think a balloon is a train?
Vordox: actually just a few weeks ago usa's government voted against un's internet control regulation proposals, and voted unanimously
Take out their nuclear weapons program, and they'll still be waging proxy wars via terrorist groups. Take out the Ayatollah, and the nuclear weapons program can just be repurposed for the peaceful purposes they've been claiming it's for all along.
is this ANOTHER troll?
twilight_sprinkle: Pffft. Voting
LOL
twilight_sprinkle our government seems to oppose everything the UN says.

Hello, administrators. I have to say that what I did was unnacceptable and wrong. It was a mistake on my behalf, and I promise nothing will come again where you will have to ban me for so long a period of time. I offer my sincere apologies.
This is the song that inspired that Minecraft song.
And it's kinda lagging.
its fine for me
Record_Discord?
baby tonight the creepers gonna steal all our stuff again

soulero: Hello
I should set up an opinion box again...
Hi

Only lagging for me cause I have other things running like skype
Anyone want to help me put opinions on my opinion box?

vinyl scratch needs some early 90s gabber :3
Scoot-Scootaloo: but this is the internet, nobody cares about opinons here
Zauroman: I said some things that were inappropriate.
Oh.
cowvarkian: That's why I'm setting an opinion box up~
Opinions are like ass holes...
Zauroman, something quite worth apologizing for. Let's just leave the details in the past.
Record_Discord: let me wrap my forgivness blanket around you
Guys how much is Minecraft to download?
Zauroman: an r34 joke that wasnt entirely appropriate, although it was somewhat related to chat at the time
Wait... pricesgood through the 21st? Safeway........
I like the minecraft version of this song better
27 dollars
twilight_sprinkle: when was that?
TheGentleManBrony: well to 'download' its free, but an account is around £20

MY parents always BOUGHT cans.

I already watched it :
F*** YEAH!!
THEY JUST DONT FUCKING GET IT
The only way that Steam's entire library will be playable on Linux is if Valve makes their own form of WINE that will perfectly emulate every game without a native Linux version.
:
@Tom: Yeah!
J_23: Tom's a bot, so he doesn't really speak. :)
Kandarihu: so, not going to happen?

SCAAAANDALOUS
FUCK THOSE GIRLS
DIE
Join us and together we can collect more cans than this school has ever seen.
GO TO HELL
Conyst: no, never
Those girls really want to be raped. Do they?
Jageman, I wouldn't bet on it not happening. If they really want it done, they'll find a way.
Scoot-Scootaloo: wht is tht video?
J_23: no rape jokes
Sorry.
^
:(
only 90$?
cheap bitch.
Rose`: I know, right?
the ashleys could learn a thing or two from scanty and kneesocks
( I'm new here. That's why. )
Those girls can burn in a fire

So MLG~
um.... hai all :D
Jageman, they want to get into console manufacturing. Big Picture is a stepping stone towards that end. If they can make those consoles without having to bump up the price by about $100 for licensing fees for Microsoft, the monetary gain will be tremendous.
Hi Kurra!
so we know the truth you fear canned goods
Random fluttershy!
SO EPIC
we need... and ace combat game

Excellent animation <3

They died
Benickerson, start with Ecclesion
tiny baby man
And if they don't love me, how do I get sex?
YOUR GOING TO LOVE MEEEE!!!!!!!
nobody loves him
Benickerson: It will be fantastic
DSNesmith: thats one flaw
You'll never be loved
No, you just didn't bother to CHECK THAT THE ExECUTIONERS WERE BACK YOU IDOT!
Benickerson: Enjoy, it's a really fun series! You'll like it!
holy shit
Oh she is good
Benickerson: Good luck! Remember, Tennant is best doctor.
Benickerson: Start with McGann <3
THEY TOLD HIM THEY KILLED HIM!!! THEY ARE HIS FATHER!!!!
Start from S1 Ep1!
Oh the irony
Haters get no love until they turn in or become neutrals
Jack Harkness FTW
McGann was amazing doctor. wish they brought him back :C
The one dude who can RUIN IT ALL....
thats right, they all died, he even killed a guy trying to fele
/me shits on everypony

And you didn't bother to kill him yourself at least?!
holy shit
You will see the Doctor and his magic ring
Benickerson watch the episode called Blink
I never saw McGann. I want to, though
HOW DID HE FIND OUT?!
magic
the First Doctor is the best doctor
/me dodges it
Tennant was the best
Benickerson: you'll love it when you start hearing about the Silence falling, that's a FUN FUN FUN story
MuffinsPrime: Empty Child > Blink imo
I'm just starting with Season 1 Episode 1. Be back when it's over :) Tally Ho!
Troughton forever
Tom Baker was best!
Rape?
MrBen: 1996 Fox Movie. It's not terribly good, but McGann is AMAZING in it and the cinematography is excellent <3
weeping angels are best monster
He even killed a guy trying to feel? Man, thats cold.
Because I'm sad and predictable like that!
Am I the only one who favors Smith?
This is why The senators trounced on Ceaser all at once!
Watch gladiator movie - talk about Dr Who 'cuz it's more kickflank XD
William Hartnell is best Doctor
To make sure he was DEAD
/me licks Bjornfot and takes him to bed

OohShiny: Destroyed in the Time War, which was "time locked"

DSNesmith: Yeah, he's River Phoenix's younger brother
NONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONO
RadicalEdward2: The Master survived, too <_<
What's with the racoon eyes?

He is hot.
He remindes me of Loki for some reason
so they say scipio
...No your the idiot who didn't kill his biggest rival personally
but they say seesar
Socks: i was doing some "stuff"<_<
Ross_Pit_shark_hunte: Cuz he's hot.
So that no loops are there
scootaloo aprroves them drummers XD
OohShiny, he and the Master were far away from the whole war when it happened. I'm not really the one to ask. Yov should ask someone who's a better expert on this.
MuffinsPrime: "I don't have time for this. I'm resonating concrete *pokerface*"
/me noms Socks back :3
damn
I can't
"...Fire on the empoeror"

Ummm
that was a deleted scene
Snake.
.....were they just drumming on a snake
:[
Snake!!!! :$
Damb asses
what did it accomplish
dumb
00,02Deadlypon3, its not really glorifying anything
Dumb adders.
besides "this is the villain in case you couldn't tell yet"
Skaro is still there, it's atmosphere is nearly gone though
showed that Commodus is a dick
Deadlypon3: Who the bow men? There holding back a 60 pound bow and aiming at there friends
really? thought it was destroyed
Deadlypon3: I'd call that satire.
Phase4 They are showing the legionares shaking in their boots on killing there own soldiers
there shouldve been bloopers , when he gets shot
*yawn*
Phase4: seems to me like they somewhat are, tbh
shot so hard
I thought that area just got time locked
"Oh boy, beans."
Because we see that they're not really dead with the Master's return
Socks: Like they're gonna kill off the "Big Bad" of the Doctor Who Universe :P
...The legionares would have killed their own men without blinking
Deadlypon3: Yeah, it's really just an action flic when you get right down to it
He ded.
Lololol
They're pretty much just on repeat forever
ahahahha
Deadlypon3: Thats was a responce to the Why are they shaking question

You're not worth to die
Touler: It wasn't very effective
those words were evil
That's 'Captain' Jack Sparrow.
You're not worth my time to kill you
