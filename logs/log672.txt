Had Badger Badger Badger, Strong Bad....
oh and PrinceDari but he is still here
Simplier times...
Helloooooooooo
i am back and i need a favor :4
:$
orginators of BronyState, one Hipster_Brony and NewDCD
Uh oh... A favor? :3
So i went inside to gamestop with my mom and she was looking at these different headsets and i was looking at this headset its called the afterglow headset but the guy told me that he said that i would not bother getting it
NewDCD yes that was it!
Afterglow is a horrible accesory company IMO.
some one link me a funny pic please
im rewarding my friend :D
does anyone read for crying out flavin! http://www.bronystate.net/about-us/history/
But i was looking at these other headsets there were the Halo 4 headset and the black ops 2 headset so yeah
http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/samanthasostarich/Funny/mlp-THEHERD.png
eh thanks? :s
Moopy: If at all possible, just get Turtle Beaches. 60 dollar ones work just as good as the rest IMO.
Moopy halo 4 headset ftw
get your halo on and get all the lady spartans
Umm actually dude im kind of thinking getting the halo 4 headset cause me and me friends are getting it and im am also and i have to wait about a week to come out but.......the after glow headset looked pretty cool to me but i guess my mom was right about the after glow headset
Moopy i once had a afterglow controller
I've never used an afterglow headset, but the controllers are horrible.
Moopy my cousin stole it
the end
What that looks like a mod?
i thought the controller was pretty cool :P
Hmph
if you play in the dark
Pffft
Looks cool, but that's about it, it jurts your eyes to have it on while gaming in my opinion.
hmm?
hurts*
there is an option to turn the lights of though!
On mine, there was a way to make the lights light up, when the controller vibrated. Playing CoD or BF... Almost had a seziure fit...
^ that was the best part
for me atleast
nah i just like lights :D
XD
Lol.
Bah! Stream!?
yay stream!
JUUSES keep scearing the crap out of me
AND THEN
Lol.
taoumi, :D
heh dat soon™ of SuperBrony64 dog i made :3
dat sudden stream
Well you know what................i have been through so many modders out there on xbox live and on xbox live i hate aim boters and i hate lagging so much
Suddenly stream :3
Who is streaming?
Spectrum_Rush, that dog
Ohai Phase4
i had one just like him
he was :3
Moopy dont play cod then lol
i'm doing my1:30 am study session w/ jsut quiet. then BAAW MUSIC
Zuxxez123: i think Phase4
taoumi: that's Phase4 for you :D
Phase4: what program do you use for irc?
OneTrickPony|Mandari, hexchat, formerly xchat
Interesting choice in music this time around Phase4 :P
i like dis song
Yeah, I suppose that makes sense. :P
kthnx
Well sorry dude im getting black ops 2 anyway........................sorry
Dunno why you are sorry.
:[
what to do
its k
Cause i already preorded the black ops 2
Lol.
The reason i said i was sorry cause im a cod fan
since you had that pic Phase4 guessing you've been lurking for the past hour eh :s
oh boy kerbals!
Spectrum_Rush, it was posted in a skype group
song name?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-k_Eg7zXuc
Don't be sorry because you like CoD, as long as you aren't a total dick about it, I'm fine with it.
thanks
Phase4: Really?, but it was only made an hour ago
both halo and cod are good in their own ways
No i don't dick about it but yeah
I like them both on their own merits, it's the fanbase with CoD mostly I don't appreciate.
hahahahahahaaha
I know not everyone that plays the game is a total ass, but it's rare to find a good person in the batch.
Zuxxez123: so I hope you appreciate this game, Kerbal Space Program :D
MadSurge: Lol, I shall appricate it!
Your awesome Zuxxex123

Hey, that fact isn't a big deal to me, I'll let them be, I'll be out getting candy. :3
yay except halloween is on a wednesday i think
oh, its your birthday OneTrickPony|birthda ?

Mmm candy!
NocturnalBlade: yup
Alright, finally back to observe Phase4's Kerbal adventures XD

Phase4: http://derpy.me/aajls not sure if you should get out
NocturnalBlade: Seems to happen here often I've noticed.
did you allow for a walk, Phase4? :3c
Can't be tired, it's almost 11 AM here :D
Zuxxez123: yea lol ya get use to it
Hi
so
People

Strabismus gives you these eyes
Hey ImOkayWithThis|!

Ohai Imperios
Opps
And Derpy has them
Hi Imperios!
Welcome to the party Imperios!!!!
Phase4, doesnt he have jet pack?
Hu
Haiyo MadSurge!
NocturnalBlade: I'll let you in on a secret. I haven't closed this brower in a day. It's been on this site the whole time.
Zuxxez123: nice job ^_^
xD
So, how are these kind of eyes called?
Rain, not powerfull enough for duna gravity
well i'm not sure
Zuxxez123: good job :D
i'ma quicksave and try
^_^
JUST powerfull enough
What did Zuxxez123 do?
Bunny~
Phase4: Can I have the playlist link you are using at the moment?
OH GOD you broke his shins Phase4
Spectrum_Rush, he's fine
Zuxxez123, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBGA2pAkNTg&feature=autoplay&list=PL152B2FA4D33AE77D&playnext=4
oh
Thank you friend.
Phase4: he's on drugs he can't feel it yet
Spectrum_Rush, shhhh, dont tell everyone that
rock too far
we're going home
I wonder how long it would take to walk this entire planet
ok, i think i will go to bed for real this time :D
night guys
Goodnight NocturnalBlade
night NocturnalBlade
/me licks NocturnalBlade
ded
Rain, a long time
lol
using a cheat sheet? :3c
lol
and then we waited
Rain, its easier than doing all the mat
math'
:P
i went through how to do the math but its boring to do by hand
so how many days have went by?
is purple home?
blue is home
purple is eve
Night NocturnalBlade
this games venus
....
I sense a certain.... Weirdness upcoming...
oh
:3
I want to play the new version so bad XD
waiting
what is green!? :O
waiting
How much is this game?
waiting some more
Rain, jupiter
its called jool in this game
can you land on it or is it actually gas?
...
Where have I heard this song before?
beep boop im bored and have homework so............
BYE!!! YOU SEXY BRONYS!!!!!1!!!
:P
so Phase4 do any of the new planets have a... quirky nature to them?
stupid moon
Spectrum_Rush, eve is bright purple
this stupid moon
Dumb Celsestial Rock Phase4 :S
*celestial
i'm going to have to go for the next orbit
this is going to be super inefficent
looks like you might be screwed, Phase4
Rain, porbably
if you are you should totally space walk
and try to direct bob into the sun without a ship
quicksave cheating
XD
dude with that orbit
he has no where near enough delta-v to hit the sun
eventually you /have/ to hit kerbin
Whelp; I'm off to bed myself friends.
Im not your friend, guy
Im joing. sleep well
joking
damn k key not liking to be pressed
I am not Candaian, I can't partake in this joke. :P
slep well Zuxxez123|Sleeping
Phase4, just time run until you smash into the planet :3
Good night all.
XD
Rain, its hard to hit the sun
night Zuxxez123|Sleeping
no kirbin
you are on an inevitable crash course
if you just time warp
oh
Rain, that takes a LONG time
so?
its not like they have limited oxygen
as in i'd probably need to leave the game running for days
even on max warp
found an intercept
there we go
our lucky kerbonaughts are going home
actually its just the one
but still
kerbonaught
:p
bob might see his family again! :D
or he will die horribly when you realize you dont have any parachutes left
seems it is uncertian about it
inb4 you crash into space junk and die
epic timing on that music
might want to slow down now
oh, well shit.
iva landing?
I think you missed it, Phase4.
its fine
i'll land
how?
Did I miss anything exciting while I was off? :3
Ooh Kerbin landing
last I checked your vector was way off and said you were going into solar orbit again
ans you have 0 thrust... >_>
how are you in the atmosphere....?
.........
Rain, it says that, but that view doesnt take atmosphere into account
what the shit
atmosphere starts at 80KM up
oh...
about 24KM is enough to bleed off anything under ~5KM/s
that must have changed then
it never took it into account :P
not from what i've seen anyway
I remember the atmosphere being much lower in the version I have
i'ma brb
give us a view outside before you go
through the window
/me licks NewSuperBronyU again :3
NO. Go away! Everything was just fine before you showed up! Go drink some coffee! With cream, or something! SHEEESH
Lay off the beavers will ya!?
:S
walk home, Phase4
XD
Rain, i'll walk home over the ocean
Hello everypony!! :)
should be there in no time
yup
ohai Ponyloverforever
swim them buns into steel
Hello Ponyloverforever
those kerbin are kings
Hahaha, the Kerbals are still stranded Phase4? :3
AdamTheDuck, eyup
not sure what to do now
you just ruined their rover
could space some more but eve is the only place to go
and getting back from that is near impossible
been to joot then? :3c
i've been to jool
not much to do there
how did you land on a gas giant?
Phase4... Save the stranded kerbalnaughts? :3
i do want to land on one of its moons but getting back from that is even harder
AdamTheDuck, last time i tried that the rescue exploded
Rain, bugs
ah
and eve is hard to get back from because it is like trying to do a second launch off of kerbin, right?
oh wow
eve's surface gravity is higher than kerbins
oh jesus
have the kerbals make a new base on eve
so you can build a new ship
its escape velocity is 1KM/s higher
Rain, i have to build a ship that can launch of kerbin and land that on eve
so i need a ship ship
i'm not sure its possible to build something so large
with the supplies that you spend decades gathering
on eve
yeah, its like doing a return trip from mars
except harder
because you need bigger ships
they need to impliment colonising
Phase4: bigger ship? http://derpy.me/WFXxd
so they can build their own ship back with materials they find on eve
after generations :3
i need ideas
my ships are insufficent
look up one that was sucessful?
and i have some big ships
Rain, i checked the fourm a few weeks after 0.17 was released, no one had managed it yet
Phase4: sumi pyramid that is twice as big and with the new stuff... hey if it could reach the sun
Spectrum_Rush, reaching the sun is easy enough :P
/me wakes up
*yawn*
oh wow
http://imgur.com/a/zdyVu#2 interplanetary capable
i am impress
http://imgur.com/a/qJSCQ#0
hmmmm
1 man or 3 man?
a return trip from the sun would be epic
xD
also what is the difference?
Rain, cant, they've implimented heat physics
3 man is heavier
so what is the benefit of 3 man?
Phase4: just get a mod that lets you self distruct it at any time
Allo everyone.
Hello Meanwhile
Rain, nothing really
well if i loose a man
lose.
which is likely during eva
Meanwhile, meh
I thought if you crash you lose all of them
I'll meh you cosmic Kerbal killer.
Phase4: try a commodore 64 emulator
JRP, NO :<
awww
MORTAL KERBAL!
Phase4: your hatred for retro tat
Rain, well yeah, but if i eva and one of them hits the ground too hard theres two to spare
Kerbals need a Scorpion skin now.
ladder >_>
Good morning everypony!
Ohai DoctoDoctorWho
'Lo DoctoDoctorWho.
Whats so good about it, DoctoDoctorWho?!
Im joking. good morning ^_^
So there's about...5 people in chat actually talking.
I wonder what kind of minerals would need to be that abundant to make the ground purple
just like old times, eh Meanwhile? ^_^
Meanwhile: you're think of Sumica, he's the Kerbal killer Phase4 is uh... um
also hai Meanwhile :P
*thinking
Phase4: just shove as many rockets in all directions as you can
i'm the kerbal... something
JRP, that is garuenteed to get me somewhere
Now we just need to draw the lottery results from all the lurkers Rain.
Pokykdgdhd
lol, Meanwhile :p
ok
I like how I have been here for near a year and only won once
and that once that I won, someone messed with my pick :3
i need to get this
to space
to the ground
and then into space again
that last bit has to happen with all the fuel left in this stage
What makes this morning so good is that I got to see you again Rain, http://derpy.me/s82IA
that gives me enough to return to kerbin from prety much anywhere
DoctoDoctorWho, ._.
practicing at home, Phase4? :3c
:D just kidding
DoctoDoctorWho, i dont get what you meen
As for the purple ground, you'd need the early lifeforms of the planet to be retinal based instead of chlorophyll, in theory that'd lead to a purple planet.
Not sure what's creepier, my licks or that meme XD
Rain, this thing wont work in the atmosphere :P
the licks
too heavy
rocket has too little thrust
/me licks Spectrum_Rush
-Courtesy of the purple earth hypothesis.
so jet airplane?
if the atmosphere is thicker that is
Im just messin with yall:)
thats good, DoctoDoctorWho
Rain, i can use jets on kerbin and the jool moon, cant on eve
my bf might get mad at you if you were actually trying to flirt with me x3
AdamTheDuck: http://i.imgur.com/xDnDF.gif
There's no escaping my licks ._.
Spectrum_Rush, what the [apples] is that
AdamTheDuck: http://i.imgur.com/1GJE0.png
Phase4, Adventure Time XD
oh shit that spider
that reminds me, Meanwhile
^
Mm?
you should kinda stop doing that
its pissing Shizuka off
Are you trying to encourage or discourage me.
discourage
Because you're accomplishing the former.
I dont exactly want you banned.
But I don't find spiders "that" scarey Meanwhile.
^
I do live in Australia :P
How are we all tonight?
/me licks Tiberium126
AdamTheDuck: Aww I'm jelly. I wish I lived there.
dammit AdamTheDuck
she sees it only as trolling, which is against the rules, which is bannable
AdamTheDuck: where the spiders are so big, they have hp bars:D
She's really got to suck it up.
Meanwhile
you just basically said "the mod doesnt like it? so what?"
/me hugs AdamTheDuck
wait, Tiberium126 is here?
Yeah I did.
I am now
the mod isn't what matters
alright, so Meanwhile is just trying to get banned now
/me tackles Tiberium126
the (admittedly overly strict) rules are
Not really. Trying to exercise my right to talk about what I want within reason is.
/me thinks getting tackled it fun
hi buddy!
Meanwhile, she asked you to stop posting pictures of insects and then you just keep doing it
Because there's nothing in the rules that say I should.
the rules do say if a mod asks you to stop doing something then you should stop
or face a warning. after the warning you face a ban if you continue
Bloody loopholes.
Meanwhile, you really do have to stop the spider thing
/me hugs DoctoDoctorWho
Bbl, gonna play some KF :P
forget the rules, people want you to stop
http://i.imgur.com/uwO2j.jpg fuck the po-lice~
lady bug :3
pls Meanwhile we like you, we don't wanna see ya banned over a silly thing
/me brohugs Tiberium126 back
Can I keep the pictures of sealife?
i like those
she kinda found that insulting when you did that
Did she find it kinda insulting when I called her pretentious?
don't know why, they weren't scary or shocking
autopilot is credit to team
Hey aussies did you hear that our Australian cops are getting Porsches now to use.
Tiberium126, wait what?
PONYS!
the cops are considered better than you
PONYS! FOR LIFE
they have good cars, they can have good guns
the chat got muddy again
Phase4, yer NSW will be getting the first
PONYS! FOR LIFE!
huh
Indeed.
the govt. hates the austrailian people
very muddy
fjia: (\
cope with the circumstances
?
You like ponys too DoctoDoctorWho
11,02fjia: I liek poniez, but please limit the all-caps spam :)
ok
alright, Meanwhile. you just keep doing what you are doing. was just trying to be friendly and help keep you from getting banned
fjia: this is a brony site, everypony here likes ponies.
I don't
Phase4, NSW will be getting them first
11,02:<
Look Rain I appreciate the thought but honestly I don't like being unable to share things I like because some people are scared of bugs.
Zia: hmph, heretic.
Tiberium126, you said :P
6_9
dammit I just wasted an hour on reddit
/me agrees with meanwhile
Meanwhile. if someone has a fear of knives would you wave a knife in their face?
Maybe, are they a tool?
ok
this stage is sufficent
never mind. you answered my question.
Phase4, Its kind of a waste of tax payers money.
I would sure as hell link them a picture of a knife
i need to land this on eve
Still Rain, since you asked and I don't find you entirely annoying, I'll purge my image base. No bugs.
you know if you like gave a warning about it or something
Tiberium126: I haz a question 4 you
DoctoDoctorWho, hit me
Im sure people that dont like it wouldnt be clicking it
/me hits Tiberium126
hmmmmmm
/me where did I go wrong
i cant attach rockets to this
says*
Tiberium126: I dont know what the added benifit to that was but okay.
Noted for future pictures of fish.
fish are 2spooky4me
/me sighs
DoctoDoctorWho, IDK but whats your question?
Zia, dont be an ass.
Tiberium126: anyway, so are you for NLR or Solar Empire?
whats is this song?
/me stops because it's Rain, wouldn't for most anyone else
thank you, Zia.
DoctoDoctorWho, I dont care really and I dont belive in the best Pony.
whats the song called???
DoctoDoctorWho, but if you put a gun to my head I would say NLR
This isnt a best pony question. I personally am fine with a double ruling 2, but if war were ever to break out between the 2, who would you side with.
ok
you?
Night everypony Moopy needs his rest so a talk to yall in the morning ok.............peace
Moopy, have a good sleep
It seems almost everypony here is siding with luna

Night moo-and gone
Anarchy.

Don't need Discord for anarchic society.
/me points and laughs at Meanwhile's lack of leadership
i like ponyes
fjia: we got it

DoctoDoctorWho, what about the other team..... you know the one we dont speak of
i just like ponyes
Tiberium126: question mark?
*Ponies* hehehe I'm being a grammer nazi
^
Anarchy, lack of leadership...uh isn't that like the definition of anarchy
/me dances to dubstep
Spectrum_Rush: yup, and Im laughing at the entire idea. because it is a silly one. hahaha
Tiberium126: grammar*

DoctoDoctorWho: You're like, the ultimate sheep.
Meanwhile, LOL you got me

Meanwhile: and what do you mean by that?
i man make pony tv
like u see ponyes tv
DoctoDoctorWho: Do as you're told without question by whomever is sat at the top purely because they're at the top.
ok guys
DoctoDoctorWho, what about the changelings and Queen Chrysalis
we start here #rainbow
OK??
jOIN

No advertising other channels.

OK I REJOIN LIKE KICK
Tiberium126: ah, THAT faction

i brb
i go eat ponye food
Ponyloverforever, but your ok?

Spectrum_Rush: out of sheer stupidity?
I feel your pain Spectrum.
Timberium126: ive got a cold :'(
Spectrum_Rush, that can be deadly
DoctoDoctorWho: this is not the time for refs
Spectrum_Rush: sorry.:(
Tiberium126: you don't say.
/me slinks away
/me hugs Ponyloverforever
Meanwhile, But I do say :P
Tiberium126: Kind of redundant,

at least i can stay off school
ITS FLYING
Meanwhile, shhh

Flying with the force of dreams.
Tiberium126: so anyway, Im a solar imperial.

that Rainbow Tylenol
I need a biscuit or something. Brb.
DoctoDoctorWho, I'm going to back stab and turn to the changelings
and I will defend her majesty against all foes, Heretic, xeno, or daemon.
ive got a sore throught too so its hard to eat :(
we didnt need those engines anyway
Ponyloverforever, hahah only liquids for you
i need to test landing the upper stage
so i need to go up
and then down
now the question is... was Meanwhile refering to a cookie or something else
AdamTheDuck?
its hard to drink too cuz my nose gets runny when i drink water when i have a cold
for the strangest reason though, changlings remind me of tyranids, a lot.
DoctoDoctorWho, They remind me of... umm...
DoctoDoctorWho, Tiberium infected ponies
Tiberium126: changlings? -_-
okay, I guess that works
What a wonderful world~
Too bad it's full of people.
Perfect
now
if it can make it into orbit
then its ready for a flight to eve
Meanwhile, indeed I hate humans
changelings are kinds cool tho, think of the possibilities if you had one as a friend
RoboGerbil, explain
Tiberium126: you want me to explain how haing a shapeshifting friend around would be awesome?
eyupo
eyup'
this SHOULD be capable of an eve return
RoboGerbil, Yup and it has to be over 100 words

oh god dat lag
Phase4
Rain
this will never leave the launch pad
yes it will
/me place your bets
this will explode
but
it will launch
inb4 the autopilot screws it up
bit wobbly
it sounds like RD is hacking a furball
there we go
Phase4, use the launch braces
*yaaaawnnnn*
Rain, ....nah
ugh... going to have to get used to a first shift schedule again. mornin' folks
why not? it can never hurt to use them x3
Rain, does kill the fps a bit
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #454
ah
>_< I'm not sure whether I want that FONV mod in the roundup based on that preview image
http://derpy.me/H-2sC >->
Spectrum_Rush - it IS a school day
and 7AM EST
Jave or PHP?
MirrorImage: NO EXCUSES
walk home, Phase4
i'ma switch to tf2 soon
WELL
well'
MirrorImage: and yet i'm up http://i.imgur.com/ySIX9.png
that happened
"oops" is never something that should be able to be said during a rocket launch
Spectrum_Rush: D8 GO TO BED
Rain, you sure?
Spectrum_Rush - do you have school today?
i use that word a lot
Rain: a virtual rocket, though... :D
pfft I ain't no school kid
XD
surprised that didnt travel to the rest of the ship and go boom
Ill be back on later tonight
Later Tiberium126!
HMMM
:D
i think i've found a bug
i'ma show you guys something i built then switch to tf2
Okies
thats suposed to say gunbuster, not gunbuser
gunbuser? the firearms have to go to school too?
its a work in progress
BOOOOOOOM
ya don't say Phase4
Ok, going to cook some lunch, bbl
it bugs it out a bit
the cool thing is the 'booster'
fully liquid and drains MOSTLY evenly
plus it exists as a single 'unit' that can be attched via a decoupler
many bugs were exploited during the production of this craft
anyone still here?
:(
alrighty imma go to sleep now see ya Phase4
night OneTrickPony|birthda
if only your name was one shorter
lol yea
yep
ksp hates me for building this thing
its so hard to do anything with it
plus i had to construct the booster in the vab
bugs out when you import it into the sph
tf2 time
hallo everypony o.o
what the crap
o.o
yay tf2 :3
Phase4
I think those random allerts are when people accept those wedding rings from others
someone know as kraftpug just sent out a less than friendly message about mlp
Rain, yeah but this one said 'mlp is shit'
o.o
/me shrugs
oppinions
he is australian aparently
i am now less happy to live here
who cares what he thinks?
oh nvm, canadian
just in the aussie group
Rain, i dont care tbh, just want to know why he bothered to spend all that money to express his opinion to everyone on tf2
lul
apparently thought it was worth it
or has a lot of cash
or both
or was drunk and had a lot of cash
drunk people can work paypal
?
some can
i cant get it to work sober
lol
maybe it makes more sense when drunk
all I know is I dont need pay pal to buy anything on the mann co store
http://derpiboo.ru/41932 relevant

read: venus
and make it back
dayum
Phase, im in the middle of downloading TF2 on my mac now
its dificult because eve is denser than kerbin and has one heck of an atmosphere
i MIGHT be able to land with extra fuel
but failing that its capable of lifting off from kerbin with the planned lander stage
wish i could turn rockets off
Phase4: ip?

Phase4: i love that spray
Good morning, Bronystate! :)

Happy Birthday, ofna01! :)
Danka herr RaveBrony!
But seriously, thanks.
:$
What is the best medic heal gun?
Usually the default one.
Ah, ok
Kritzkrieg isn't bad, but the quick-fix is relatively useless.
I GOT DA KRITZ
Of course, any of them are good if you can use them properly.
/me is downloading steam hoping it doesnt get 1fps on a macbook
TF2*
All dat crate.
Meh, i have a strange quick-fix, i have no clue where i got it from. Just wondering if I could sell it.
I suppose i will :$
My computer which had TF2 has a bad graphics card, so i have to use my laptop now :(
You can probably find someone who'll trade for that.
Yeah :P
and by bad graphics card i mean the card is ded
Ill take a look around
Trade server's your best bet.
ofna01: You must get new one! D:
so if i turn down the quality do you think it will be playable on a Macbook?
I just use outpost, lol.
hello
'Lo.
/me fears face-to-face/talking trade :D
3 hours for it to download
Thats not bad
Dat high-five taunt.
ohmahgerd my macbook has over 100 gigs of space O_O
:P
I don't always wear hats, but when i do, i wear my White gibus.
Stay hatty my friends
:D
I always wear hats. And it's usually my bill's. :I
I have a Meet the Medic taunt
i literally got it in a drop xD
:3
Rave, you should give me a hat
How long have you been playing tf2? :o
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZouYNu3Z6k
Aww that super is awesome.
i have i think 340+? hours.
Spy, scout and Engie are my main classes
Youtube link during stream? :o
Phase said i could post music
Oh alrighty
I know you know the rules, so i was jw :D
I want mooooooooooooooooooore
ofna01: That mant hours, how do you not have a hat yet? o_o
Rave, how about a hat for my birthday? :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8C8vGRlxZM
Pinkamena in this game is like Nocturne from LoL.
You could at least have enough metal to craft a random one.
Nope
not even 1 ref
._.
I'm still a F2P
Oh
I believe i have a Fancy Fedora
But still, i dont have any hats to trade atm.
but thats for my Gentlespy set
THEN ill have hats to spare
I have like 5 of those...
Salvaged?
Nope
:P
Phase4, trolololol
I have all of the 40's
Salvaged # 40 goes for 12keys atm
and i think 1 #30
People expect it to get to 16+
>12 keys
>crate
lolno
I'm not paying 12 keys for a crate
Its a Salvaged crate (super-rare)
The some stranges are worth more than the crate itself :P
Metal gear!
*Then some
I might pay that much for a HAT, but considering the gamble you take when opening crates, it isn't worth it...
Meh
I'm gonna change my steam download location
one sec
If I sell my crate for 16 keys, ill have enough to get everything I want in tf2 :3
theres a quater second ping
so half a second lag
i cant do any close encounters because i will die before my client knows i've died
:o
Dead by dawn.
00,03Gotta move that gear up!
Hey Scoot-Scootaloo

I had my birthday dinner and stuff yesterday, since my birthday is on a monday
Sliders <3
Ah :P
I asked if FiW is okay to pick as pony episode... you guys said yes
and then you block me
wuuuuuut
O_o
I hate being the pony, lol.
Why would FiW be considered an actual ep...
Im awful at melee :D
because it is an actual episode
You can do it Phase!
I enjoy melee D
xD
THE CMC :D
whacking someone with a Atomizer just makes sense
what if really good animators made an episode themselves... we should beable to vote for that
(the quality like Picture Perfect Pony)
00,03lolno
Well that's cleared that up^
Pretty much
YAY
unlike when I first asked and you guys said that it was okay
What about G1 and G3 eps? ;)
NO
NO no no no
No thos're considered troll entries from now on.

ofna01: You just ahve to get lucky drops :P
Don't argue with TF2's logic.

MUS TARD JAR!
Aw, I want Schadenfreude.... that lucky bastard
I've never played Arena Mode on TF2.
ima go play some happy wheels :P
But that's because I don't have anyone to play it with.

killerpony7733: Eeyup. Took a break from bronystate. Had stuff to do. And ponys are to distracting >.>
My steam is being stupid....
One does not simply take a break from bronystate.
Mega_Milk Makes sense, lotsa stuff happend here and there on BS and all
went from 1mbps to 16.9 kbps....
Id imagine so.
2 days for a download now it says :S
ponies are probably one of the most distracting things in the world
ofna01, that's the reliable download servers from Steam that we all know and love~
ofna01: Torrenting?
Nope, from Steam
ofna01: Ah.
Steam, i <3 you, but your stupid sometimes :|

/me keeps hugging Dark92Enigma
/me hugs Dark92Enigma
by the way ofna01, happy birthday
thanks Dark
/me hugs ofna01 back
and another thing, i probably won't be available for Friday Movie nights anymore
for Friday morning/afternoon when the newsletter comes, and i get my chance to play the lottery, YES. At Euro Movie night, YES. but not on Friday nights (at least not entirely)
we'll still be here for ya, Dark92Enigma :)
Why? because my parents suddenly think i'm at the PC the whole day, and they say ''we won't let you keep it anymore''
so, i will be using this little gadget at my mom's house, where i am right now
Sylandest: thanks :)
Dark92Enigma: :3 wubs
Point taken, i sleep a whole lot better, but still, i used this for SVR 11 formulas, entrance theme songs, and i was starting another proyect.
It so happens that YuGi-Oh: The Pyramid Of Light is this weekend, right?
Yup
Yeah LD
*:D
i think i have sleep insomnia
well, since Silverscreen is gone, i'm gonna take on that movie this way: I'm gonna watch it on YouTube, come up with a few jokes, be sure if another critic reviewed it already, tell some jokes of my own (like in MST3K) write them down and post them to Microsoft Word, and them copy/paste them here.
there might be textwalls, like the one above ^
In fact, i'm gonna watch it right now.....It's time.....
TO
D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-UEL
/me adds this comment so the chat is not just Dark92Enigma
So, what is the other movie?
Sylandest: sorry
Dark92Enigma: AWWWW YEAH :$
Dark92Enigma: nothing to apologize for, silly :D I was trying to make a laugh
Sylandest: oh :D
The schedule goes like this:
booooo
■B Movie: Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Pyramid of Light selected by MrBen
o_0
■Pony 1: Read It and Weep selected by AJisBestPony
eh
Hi :)
first 3 weeks and he/she wins
05evening
Wrek Afternoon
Hello MaxTheBrony
Hai Wrek
and........yes, i didn't see this coming
Heya Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH :)
■Pony 2: A Friend in Deed selected by ezio_auditore
Heya Wrek :)
'Lo Wrek.
Oh hai Wrek
Hey Wrek!
Dark92Enigma: what are you talking about?
YOu mean AJisAwesome winning?
Which is why Shizuka changed the voting mode for the episodes
Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: i meant, that this episode was played ALMOST. EVERY. WEEK.
Oh
Don't get me wrong, i like it, but........when was the last time we saw......RETURN OF HARMONY?
I mean here
I'm going to the pool in two hours, I'll be dead tired after that :D
Dark92Enigma: I'd vote for that, but then we would have to watch both parts
05http://i.imgur.com/7XHLf.jpg
MadSurge: remember when we watched A Mare In The Moon here?
that was part 1
and we finished movie night
Dark92Enigma: nope
we only showed PART 1
and we finished movie night
MadSurge: ok
OH NO, YOU ENDED ON A CLIFFHANGER! YOU BASTARDS :D
the same thing could happen to Return of Harmony or A Canterlot Wedding
if they show their respective part 1's
Dark92Enigma: just end on Cadance burning Twilight :D
MadSurge: dat cliffhanger
Dark92Enigma: I see why they opted to jump a week to show both parts back to back
MadSurge: it gets even darker when you put a BGM from Saint Seiya (Knights Of The Zodiac)
*jump, or skip
MadSurge: Yeah, i see that
Dark92Enigma: Ah yeah, I remember that series
MadSurge: anyway the BGM is called ''Direction Of Heated Fights''
08,01so apparently, Gangnam Style is #1 in the UK charts
08,01which is just... mind blowing
08,01considerign how xenophobic the UK is
08,01it's me!
08,01 \o/
08,01i'm putting together a piano cover of Gangnam Style
/me rolls out the blue carpet
/me 08,01rolls about
MadSurge: it is. on. every. CLIFFHANGER. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4p-lrj40iw start at 1:30 and play the cliffhanger from the wedding
For some reason Italy never had much of a problem with mildly violent manga like 4kids
Oh yeah, GANGNAM STYLE seems to be the bomb
OP OP OP
OPPA GANG
-nam style
MadSurge: you mean anime*? sorry, i don't want to sound like a jerk
damn you tiny computer!
The really violent anime though is aired only on cable or regional channels, and that's why to this day the Fist of the North Star sucks balls :D
Dark92Enigma: OHGOD, IT'S THIS THEME :D
never watched Fist Of The North Star, mainly because it was never shown in my country
08,01who is streaming?
MadSurge: it took me FORRRRRREVER to find it
There's a stream?
Hoody|School: nope
Buffer channel
There was a stre-----oh wait, no otherwise, i would get instaban for the link
Dark92Enigma: it's pretty good, even if Kenshiro is OP :D
OP?
In fact, Kenshiro being OverPowered is part of the fun :F
*:D
sorry, i know OOC and OC but not OP
oh
OVER POWERED
08,01nah, it's fine, i've got work to do anyway
08,01go ahead, wrek
08,01but first
08,01http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CayMeza487M
MadSurge: then why you said it sucked balls?
The local giant thug comes over and taunts Kenshiro, Kenshiro touches him and the thug explodes
Dark92Enigma: the italian dub sucks
MadSurge: oh you live in Italy, that's why you say it aired only on cable
Dark92Enigma: yep
MadSurge: Talk about the touch of death
You know whats better than death-touch?
A gun
Dark92Enigma: I think they redubbed it on DVDs though, so it's great :D
08,01heeeeeeeeeeey sexy lady
08,01op op op op
08,01oppam gangnam style

hello everyone :)
Dark92Enigma: well, pressure points make you do anything in that anime :D
OPPA GANGNAM STYLE
Bring chat back and it's gangnam style. Could be worse I 'spose.

Hello youi too Meanwhile :)
Hoody|School don't drive while you are at school!
Hi Meanwhile!
MOBILE CLASSES
Driving test?
Learnin on wheels
MadSurge: lol, why they couldn't use the DVD-dub?
Don't let Spongebob drive, thats for sure
Dark92Enigma: because regional channels don't have the money/don't bother getting that dub :D

08,01oh god

I just saw a semi drive by my place with the company name "AJ Transport LLC"
08,01unless they're small, simple gifts like i give
/me is the most wonderful time, of the year........*
08,01i mean like... i give somethign i know the person will really like, and appreciate, but not something expensive, or even useful
08,01and i don't give them to everyone i know
08,01if i find somethign that fits someone, they get a gift
08,01if not, i don't
08,01*if not, they don't
08,01and i don't go out looking for gifts; it's more that if i come across something suitable, i'll use it
Hello everypony...I had nightmares the other day.
05ok bootin' up
VenHur: what kind of nightmares? :O
/me hugs and greets VenHur
I wonder if we could get some ncie Chrimas Stream :) for after the nowerdays short family time is over :)
ello VenHur you did not dream sweetly
08,01Meanwhile: i don't like the carols, the gratuitous commercialness, the concept of santa claus, the religious aspect, the sense of obligation to buy gifts...
MadSurge: Remember "Welcome To Ponyville"? ...Yeah, THAT nightmare.
08,01i could go on
hello VenHur :)
I just like the presents :p
VenHur: ...I don't really know, no
08,01this stems from when i was engaged
08,01my parents would want me to spend it with them
VenHur: Was it that nightmare where everyone had a rock for a face?
08,01and, of course, i couldn't spend it with both of them, because they *hated* each other
08,01realy hated each other
Hoody|School: No...it's worse than that.
Were you on fire? Did someone touch you?
I meant that creepy looking pony with that creepy face!
Streamception!
08,01my favourite time of year is Beltane
VenHur: I can only think of the SmilePinkie, unfortunately O__o
Bonfires in may? cool!
08,01i celebrate my brthday
Ohai Petrified_Discord!
08,01alwasys with a huge party
/me 08,01can throw a fucking good party
^
I like halloween.
On The Internet, nobody knows you're a pony.......so true
Even the lesser known ones! I. Loved. Them. ALL.
Free motherfucking candy
NOSTALGIAWEEN!
Or rather, I used to. Nowadays interest in it seems to be declining over here.
Shit gotta go
later
to old for free candy NEVER!!
I really really hate Halloween
See ya Hoody.
Did you know they haven't made candy corn since 1982? They just pick it up off the street, repackage it, and sell it again next year :P
hi Lil_B
Bye Hoody|School
hello there Maid_RainBow :)
Halloween, The pros? FREE FUCKING CANDY! The cons? Cavaties.
Petrified_Discord: I believe that.
laters, everypony. Edumacation time.
see you later Sylandest :)
08,01VenHur: i've had a few cavities in my time
/me hugs Lil_B
08,01the amount of sugar i eat, i don't think anyone's really surprised
08,01you know that sick feeling you get when you eat too much sugar?
Lil_B: why? You don't like trick or treaters?
08,01i don't get that
You're dentist don't mind either.
Your*
MadSurge nope, don't like them, I'll explain
inb4 my own Textwall
/me preps for textwall
At least that what's I known.
08,01diabetes runs in my family
Diabeetus.
08,01so i know that at some point i'm going to be diabetic
ok, i'll be off for a while, re-watching Yu Gi Oh the pyramid of light first-hoof
Wrekception
08,01so i'm enjoying sugar while i can
I know a guy with diabetes, he really doesn't look after himself as well as he should. :/
i'll still be here, but i'll see the movie on full-screen
I might do some pros and cons sometimes, for the lols.
MadSurge We already have a Holdiday where Kids can Dress up as whatever they want and get a shit ton of candy for free
Lil_B: same here :D but we don't get kids asking for candy here, except in the city squares :D
Lil_B: carnival?
08,01i don't actually celebrate Haloween
08,01because it's the same day as (and actually based on) the festival of Sammhuin
08,01*Samhuinn
08,01Meanwhile: because the festival i celebrate instead involves fire and naked people
08,01and costumes
08,01and holds emotional significance for me
MadSurge almost identical, but here it really is more about beeing goofy
Fair enough.
You know what might makes the experience of Halloween even cooler?
08,01also, body paint
08,01http://beltane.org/about/samhuinn/
Dead peoples rising from thier graves and doing the Thriller dance for our own entertainment.
Your arguement is invalid.
Lil_B: I like candy and monster costumes, but only the good ones and doing it for the sake of it :D
08,01this is what happens at Beltane and Samhuinn: http://beltane.org/gallery/
more pylons
YOU NEED TO CONSTRUCT MORE PYLONS
MadSurge I think I really just hate the fakt that it's 100% brought upon us by companies. the first time kids were going around in my village was 10 years ago just when I was grown out of that phase :/
08,01MadSurge: it's fucking awesome
08,01there's also drums
08,01lots
08,01of drums
31. October is the Reformation day for the evangelic People in germany, it doesn't have much significance as far as I know even for them (I'm gatholic, b ut I couldn't care less :) )
I like lots of Drums :) I would like to see (and hear) that
08,01MadSurge: awesome!
Lil_B: I like drums, but not afro drums :D
08,01MadSurge: you're in the UK, aren't you?
08,01MadSurge: who am i thinking of , then?
Oh, I like drums too...
GilDash maybe?
I 'unno, GilDash? :D
08,01maybe
...But, they're not my favorite intrument.
08,01anyhoos, your cuttlefish festival sounds amazing
That honor goes to the fucking electric guitars.
Gotta love seafood.
08,01MadSurge: as a scottish person, i approve of this
I like Seafood, I hope our class has it's next go to thje Chinese Restaurant for the Buffet soon :)
Heya guys :)

Lil_B Hello
08,01i have a friend in california, one of my best friends of all time, and we have this agreement: if she's with a girl when she wants kids, i'll impregnate her. if i'm with a guy when i want kids, she'll carry my baby (if she can)
I be lurking
Hey killerpony7733!
And if your boyfriend doesn't want kids?
Why do i get hi'd when i have been here since around 2 PM my time and it's 5 PM
Even if it's slightly illegal?
08,01Meanwhile: if he didn't want kids, i wouldn't be with him
I don't know, Wrek doesn't seem so good right now :/
Also
What about just adopting a child
Would maek the sitation easier, no?
Lil_B: not all matches can go well :(
Right
Serenity some countries are really awful with adopting rights, I know it's really hard to adopt a Child in germany, whole lot of legal issues
His footmen seem way outmatched by green.
I'm off on WoW
Lil_B: Not too bad in Britain
Or blue, whichever.
Serenity that's good :) I don't really get why the government is making it so hard sometimes :)
Because 90% of political parties are nobb'eds
MadSurge yeah, if most charge at you in the beginning than it's really just bad luck :(
Serenity Well just my thought but some may want a kid of their own blood ya know
hi i just got here and whats goin on ponys :D
Donate blood to him if you're the same type :P
hello AceRanther :)
And that would appear to be the end of that.
hi Lil_b
AceRanther you can just write part of the name and press TAB to find the names faster :)
YYOu have been struck with a terrible fate haven't you
powned last minute and thanks Lil_B
why is the chat now so dead? -.-
dunno
maybe it got stabed by social life
right in the kidneys
eeyep
meh :/ just 5 min ago people were talking a lot
and hey ofna01 :)
i was taking a nap
05its cause i am streaming
05people always tend ot shut up then
05its like the purposley try to make me sad :C
^
to
not ot
you always get mad at us Wrek
it hurts our feelins
We're in awe, Wrek :P
lali-ho y'all
wrek the graphics on the snes port of doom are really gabage
Would you rather we were all quietly watching or having our attention focused on talking about something else Wrek? :P
the Jaguar Port of DOOM is the best Port, but has no music XD
most doom ports were based off the source code of the jaguar port
Hello Dken2021!
... reminds me... I wanted to rerip the Music Samples from the SNES VErsion again with lover Frequenzy so I don't have to manually strech all the Samples -.-
hi there Dken2021 !
hey there MadSurge and Lil_B, how are ya?
dont get me wrong but the snes port had awsome music
I'm fine :)
hi Dken2021 ;)
listening to some intense Moonsonate 3rd movement XD \m/
JRP: unlike the genesis port :D
hai AceRanther
protect them attack it always works
i mean then
I recently ripped a lot of Music Samples from SNES games, but they are all really short (usually 1s> ) and LMMS can't strech while keeping the same Note :/
JRP: the genesis one had music made by the fart orchestra :D
not themprotect ur gonna lose if ya dont
The Genesis actually had something like a Soundfont in the System on which all games coulkd rely on, while SNES games always had to bring their own Samples on the Cardridge
Lil_B: wernt they ".raw*"
So how does this game mode work exactly?
JRP I don't actually know, I only have the Genisis Soudnfont in SF2. I usually don't work with actually game files
yes they were ".raw*' files because i riped some before
like riped the write the game
right*
stupid green guy
08,01holy shit
08,01my hair is pink
Did you only just remember that?
08,01Meanwhile: it just surprised me
x]
/me puts on a delayed surprised face
08,01Lil_B: it's been pink since April
kill ur ally i mean betry him befor he betrays u
It's a strange tactician who risks his allies turning on him when there are common enemies to deal with first.
he comes
moin everypony
'Lo Invi.
mornin Invi
08,01 i'm eating prunes
but to put a good ally to rest is to put a enemy first and he might proritise first Meanwhile
08,01and drinking grean tea
That really was not a coherant sentence.
Guude Invi
i know i got muddled up
:D
moin Lil_B ^^
What game is this?
Starcraft 2
and who is that guy in the corner?
Wrek.
but the reson is hes closer to him so its risky when fighting the ally hes made
I don't even think the alliances are dynamic in SC2.
ikr
kill both enemys
Meaning if you start as allies you're stuck that way. Unless I'm mistaken.
but i have the game
hello everypony :d
I really wanna play an Old RTS now -.-
yo brodashX
hai brodashX
hello brodashX
hi brodashX
Lil_B, Warlords Battlecry 3 was aawesome ^^
Hai brodashX
I have the game too.
but with out reson only
And tbh dynamic alliance isn't really a feature well applied to warfare RTS.
or something more build up like the Settlers or ANNO
Lil_B, but you can equip and skill your own hero there :3 and it's pretty cheap on ebay ^^
i know
It's the type of thing you have in games that focus on civilisation without specifying conflict.
Invi I bought to Much, I sumply must Stop now!
Lil_B, :D okay then
i have black and white its that sort of game
Black and White is kinda funny, but it becomes boring too fast
i know
to needy
maybe some ANNO 1602 or 1503 :) or if you like really tidius work, play the Partrician 3 XD
powned
ok
has he seen the army of yellow
I'd call the Partrician 3 after 10 years still the best, most Complex and well thought out Trading and building Simulation to date
I always had too many wood guys :D
ok dodjy ate sim
date
sim
werid
wat?
build a army
an.
massive army to win the game
It looks like there's a limit on the number of troops at any one time.
i said Eeyup to cleverbot and it sang winter wrap up WIN
lol
hehehe
hmm
heh#
hehehehe
how many atempts
just win or lose

It was a good chat, fool hardy in its youth.

WHY MUST THE GOOD ALWAYS DIE YOUNG, WHYYYYYYY
It... wait a tic is that pie?
yes
chat is like dredd 3d with that drug....

It's as though chat has encountered some kind of temporal anomaly and is acting at reduced speed.
yes
So, how is everypony today?
Bored.
Also, happy October!
I fininshed a sweet potato pie D:
Dken2021: Finished as in baked, or finished as in ate?
hey guys

You seem rather unhappy for someone who just ate.

No I think it stopped.

08,01so i've been listening to more k-pop
08,01and i really like it
pinkie can break the fourth wall like we break soldier
05go to srs
05leave yout thoughts on the link i put in
gå og legg deg
:o
anyone laik the song i linked? :D
Ello there everybrony.
I saw 'dubstep' in the title and shut it off.... since im stubborn like that :\
'Lo Malavolent.
:o
What RaveBrony said.
well thats sad RaveBrony, it was a cool song
Don't like dubstep.
i didnt like it, but i hadnt heard anyone else then skrillex, wich is shait
kinda felt the song was a bit weak
Its not fully the fact that i dont like dubstep...its more along the line of, Im sick of people commenting on Techno/Trance vidoes saying "This is the best dupstep Ive heard!/Wheres the drop? This is awful"
Dken2021: starts weak, ends awesome, my opinion
eh, to each their own
well it
ups
it had a drop and it was cool RaveBrony
listening, starts weak, develops unoriginally, and the drop isn´t anything special. Call it a 3-4/10
Unnr: you a critic or something? :P
I dont like the drop... I like techno/trance. Where the rhythm is nice and steady/repetitive
we are all different you know
mentallyeffedguy: just have listened to far too much music
and that piece is competently built, but nothing special
its impossible to listen to to much music, know what im sayin Unnr ?
Im not hating on it! Im glad others can enjoy it. Im just stubborn and refuse to listen to it :\
Im eclectic tho. So there will be dubstep songs here and there that ill like im sure :D
mentallyeffedguy: then you have never listened to a purposfully de-synched Zireeka
*Zaireeka
Unnr: is it bad?
I even listen to some yodeling now, ffs :D
Yoda-lay-hee-hoo
:D
anyone here enjoy listening to justin bieber?
._.
Boop-Oop-A-Doop
mentallyeffedguy: Zaireeka is a four disk album by The Flaming Lips that is created so that you play any combination of the disks together to get the songs
Unnr: and i guess you put them together in a shitty way?
guys im still watching it
http://derpy.me/a-1uG

I take it we had a fiasco about s3 when I wasnt around?
DED! How??
yup, the chat is on hiatus until we have season 3 in our hands
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7R3i6yEwRE
This place needs more sand
O
about 2 cubic tons
/me throws sand on SpadeMagnes[R].
what about spagetii?
and bacon
I will never understand Yolo...the concept is retarded
afternoon Bronystate :)
Hi, BladedWings :)
'noon to ya BladedWings
hi BladedWings
SpadeMagnes[R]: How is "You only live once" retarded?
SpadeMagnes[R]: I liked MMX Command Mission, just wish the VAing in it was better.
SpadeMagnes[R]: its easy. Its an excuse to make retarded things. nothing more.
CrazyCherry: The way it is implemented is idiotic.
Hello BladedWings, I'm still keeping an eye on you.
The concept is people use it is for bullshit excuses
^
Its basically a excuse to do stupid shit
CrazyCherry: what are you, a zombie?
SpadeMagnes[R], the concept itself is good, but peoples are retarded >.>
^
Carpe Diem is a much better alternative.
BladedWings: Maybe. >_>
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlV6sFcMtcA&feature=relmfu
CrazyCherry: it would be the only way you could keep an eye on me :D
BladedWings: Maybe not the only...
YOLOMLG360NOSCOPESWAG
Sonic 3 and K has alot of glitches
but you have to really go out of your way for them
also, im looking for contributions to that word
well anyway...wait why are you keeping an eye on me again CrazyCherry
One glitch fucks up the game so bad it speeds up the music and slows down the gameplay
BladedWings: Bladed wings...
/me looks at his wings "oh yea XD"
I still love the idea of bladed wings, though.
/me rages. "THAT'S SUPPOUSED TO BE MY PATENT. :("
Seems interesting.
Also fun fact, in launch base and hidden palace its possible to "destroy" Robotnik
AJIsAwesome, like the nargacuga?
you have to hit him 257 times though <.<
SpadeMagnes[R]: I saw that glitch. :D
Invi: Nargacuga?
AJIsAwesome, never played Monster hunter? ^^
Nope. ^_^''
I have to admit I was stuck in carnival night for a bit
Stupid barrels...
CrazyCherry: calm down, i'm not stealing anything
I FINALLY KNOW!
Which A movie I'll vote on for now
Pokemon 2000
Perfect A movie
SpadeMagnes[R]: STUPID BARREL.
You mean I had to press up and down?! UP AND DOWN?!
the barrel of doom? *shivers* so... much ...wasted time :(
I forget how many hits does the death egg robo take in sonic 2?
Wow. That's pretty cool.
ikr? ^^
Sonic Jam's easy mode kills it in 3 hits
SpadeMagnes[R]: :D
I find it hilarious that a well made game like Sonic 3 & K has so many glitches in it
i find DOOM enjoyable so far
I fucking love the arranged version of X3's sound track

chat half alive!
half life
Just got back from college clasees.
*classes
:P
Considering getting a better hard drive for my laptop.
Gotta go fast
AJIsAwesome get an SSD
SSD?
what's with some of them crossed out
?
Is chat moving faster than a mile per hour yet?
I guess so.
Solid State Drive
more durable
Not even close
Oh.
and FAR quicker
Thanks, Chrysalis. :)
Gotta go fast
like 20-50 times faster
depending on how much you spend
Faster Faster
oh nvm, those are episode without the characters
Hello ponyfolk, how has your day started out?
Hi, Zuxxez123! :)
hi
Pretty good, just got back from college classes.
Never knew you were in college
Oh, that must've been tons of fun. :P
SpadeMagnes[R]: You didn't? :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd2GQHkaCSI
must be tons of fun there AJIsAwesome
Sort of.
It's in the middle of "fun" and "boring" right now.
And chat slows down to a crashing halt.
What are you majoring in AJ?
So it's...bun.

Meanwhile: You could say thst.
Bun sounds better than foring.

I miss my Glover game...
I miss my Super Mario Land 2 game.
I still own that, and I am amazed my N64 still works
I miss my PSOne and my Crash Bandicoot collection. xD
I miss Legend of Legaia, even though I was too young to play it at the time
waves hello to Queen_Chrysalis
My PS one stopped working a couple years ago.
hi
I still own Mario pary 1...much to my dismay
Fucking control stick minigames
Your poor hand...
I was playing Monster Rancher 2 and then it crashed.
SpadeMagnes[R]: I actually LOVED Mario Party 1 as a kid.
Monster Rancher; LOVE that game. :D
08,01huh, cool
Doh I missed
08,01apparently, The Hub has announced that S3 will air in November
hi
Waluligi needs a game, he came out of left field
allo Applejack2012
Early November?
SpadeMagnes[R]: So does Daisy.
Wario's origin got sort of explained
Waluigi is there for no fucking reason
Waluigi onloy exist because wario needed a partner for tennis
^
Daisy needs a better backstory. Either that or more.
The only backstory she got was Mario Party 3.
*was in
Also Smash Melee is the only game to actualy swap peach's sprite to look like Daisy
SpadeMagnes[R]: i thought brawl did it too?
Daisy had her own sprite in Brawl.
Melee did it more better, instead of a dress chance it actulaly changed its design and skin and hair color
Meh, I never really followed the secondary characters in Mario games.
They were just there for me.
Peach has what only 2 games where she isnt kidnapped?
and ones she activly helps in?
I'm not sure if I want Sticker Star.
There was her own game, and Super Paper Mario
Lol, besides the ones where she plays random sports, you may be onto something there Spade. :P
I like the fact that Sticker Star is going back to the RPG style gameplay, but I'm not sure about the sticker gimmick.
Dont judge a game till you try it
True.
Unless its Sonic 06
^:S
season 3 in november
DAT POST
yay
Not sure. I'll give it a few minutes.
I'm sure it will have its appeal at first, but quickly become an annoying gimmick.
Wonder how long it'll take for that to be outed as a troll post.
^ :D
Lies coming straight from EQD
trollers gonna troll
Someone screen cap it?
thats on Derpy news too
Now that I think about it, a cure for the common cold is impossible

Oh, Animal Crossing?

08,01and all i have to console myself is this rapidly diminishing box of prunes
08,01god, i love prunes
/me 08,01wonders how many boxes he'll need to go through before he no longer likes prunes
im in a bad mood too considering that i had 12 hours of class and had terrible migranes whole day long =\
08,01Ankano_BrOnyxia: :( that sucks
No stream?

Weird... I got warm... I like it. :3
So, BronyState, got any plans for Halloween? Like streaming some Bruce Campbell movies?
and a fireplace
its called fireplace for your home or something
Eddmario: Buying a ton of candy corn and scarfing it down?
Seriously, what happened in the game up till now? I wasn't paying attention.
I will probably be here
hehe my father got this fire as a DvD from a random guy
Meanwhile: All I recall is Taco hat guy.
the fire gives you a warm feeling and its not real
/me wishes the hub was in this country
Zuxxez123: better than nothing.
AJIsAwesome: I was actually aiming that question at the mods about any Halloween events going on here...
Ok, so there's tacohat guy and there was a fat man in a bad wig ealier.
Eddmario: I now. :D

Whatever this crap is I'm sure I'll figure it out in due time.

Meanwhile, and don't forget the ferry guy with the fake chest hair
hmmmmmm
I missed that bit Invi.
There has got to be a really deep meaning to this video... But I am too derpy to know what that may be...
Meanwhile:this is called fireplace for your home its on netflix

sonicandmario85: I meant the...fuckin' hell never mind.
Darn! :D
sonicandmario85: He was talking what was going on in the game. Lol.
Ded.

I wouldn't say no
You want a marshmellow? Here, take this. ;)

I WANT A HOT DOG

This is something that'd probably make sense if I was paying attention earlier.
Invi:i dont know maybe but i do know in the mornings its cold there
Well. Maybe. So far all I've seen is a guy in a tacohat talking about llamas and this old bhuddist.
Invi:las vegas is 5 hours from there so after we were done with flagstaff we went to vegas
More Myst?
vegas? only with mah best buddy :D
Mongul.
you know
:D
oh Shizuka, I'm gonna be coloring that and detailing it.
This is making even less sense.
he speaks pretty good english for a mongol horde :)
dschingis?
Invi:one night there in the hotel at vegas we were leaving but before we did for dinner we orderd pizza from pizza hut and we ate and left we brought the left overs with us
Ghengis khan speaks pretty good english
Ryunosuke: Right? Kind of shocking isn't it...
Ryunosuke robot is translating for you to understand
an audacious foolish worm
and the lips? :p
Invi:when we got back our cats was pissed at us XD she was shedding because she was so upset we were gone so long
hahah
pwn\
xD
cat*
Falcon paunched...
Well that was the most amusing thing that's happened so far.

Would you like to ride on my beautiful baloooon?

something: are you an alicorn? :P
Shizu: I think a bridge would work better. XD

Which is easier to maintain though?
13balloon can transport heavy stuff without you needing to lift it the whole way
Hm, point.

Punch it!

PEZ! Another joke that will never be dated
AceAttorneyEdge: guy here was saying his oc would be in s3
If he/she was a supposed "friend" of the maker of MLP, I thought something would've presented him/herself better.
Seems legit.

We need Captain Falcon.

Marx: we all have. :P

Imagine being stuck in a burning car and the only way to save you is by breaking the windshield
This glass cannot be unmade by any mean that we here possess
use the gun
13back to the sledgehammer

ITS TOUCHING ME
Shizuka XD i dont mean it liek that

The bubbles, I'd be scared from the to burst and send lava everywhere. xD
So beautiful
it doesnt look like youtube
looks like the bubbles from the incredibles
CrazyHippie: yet deadly
great now the lava looks like boobies
It reminds me of a newborn Horta.
Shiiiny~
It's sort of hard to tell what's actually happening....
as you see its forming into igneous rock right now
the bubbles are probably from the water melting then evaporating
with orange liquids
DAM IT
Bubbleception?
must pop bubbles
I wanna poke it with a stick :3
Eli_Berlin: I'd still want one as a pet :D
Use liquid hot magma to clear away that frozen driveway in the winter - and never worry about ice again...or a driveway
AWW SHIT
The ice looks like it's actually burning, and the lava looks like it's rapid cooling
That's what happens when you microwave Kraft cheese...
that looks...tasty
lava looks tasty
CrazyHippie: you played too much pokemon. me too :P
ITS GONNA BURN THE SEWER RATZ :O
twilight_sprinkle: DONT EAT THAT
twilight_sprinkle: IKR

It weird how it goes from looking like playdoh, back to sand... It's amazing..
wat if science made ponies real?
princess i know, because they link together, but alone they drown
Dovah: video doesn't have sand.
sound*
It's not merely that it doesn't absob water-- it repels it, so instead of wet sand, like at a beach, you get dry mass.
k

That is AMAZING.
Panda: Yeah, I thought that was amazing

Phase4: sky has no logic, blame pinkie
FOR THE EMPRAAAAHHHHHHH
dawn of war 2 is waaaaay better
Anyone play Warhammer with the little statues figures you painted yourself?
Zuxxez123: no, why do you need to do that anymore anyway? youve got dawn of war
SirGanjalf: It is said that starting out as a scout, each and every space marine could be virtually invisable on the battlefield if they wanted to, they're just so OP they dont give a damn
RoboGerbil: I've played some other RTS then - I remember DoW as one of the most dynamic RTS i've played in a long time
RoboGerbil: I meant before the good games came around. xD
Zuxxez123: I really want to, but that requires money
I keep hearing a skype comment, and keep checking my own Skype. xD
DoctoDoctorWho: Of course they don't give a damn, otherwise the commander would wear a fucking helmet!
SirGanjalf: well just wait till the 3rd+ missions where hes killing off whole armies just to rebuild them to take out 1 bunker
DoctoDoctorWho: I want to have them again, mine were lost long ago in a fire... Bleh...
Zuxxez123: put yourself on do not disturb
RoboGerbil: Must play again then, because i've finished it already.

Chainsaw swords are best swords

No clouds in the sky.

Hello Lunar_Brony
Hi, Lunar_Brony :)
ello Lunar_Brony
DoctoDoctorWho:WAHHHHHHHHH WAHHHHHHH WAHHHHHH MOMMY THIS MWANS BEING MEAN lol jk
Not quite sure what I'm looking at, but I know Caramel's streaming
/me shoots somepony with time
so . . . what is this?
Welcome Lunar_Brony, please, join us in watching the death of gun and chainsaw sword weilding orcs.
Dawn of War 2.
Soulstorm
Zuxxez123 cool, thx
:3
DoctoDoctorWho: shooting with time?
Who is streaming?
Caramel
I can tell from the pony in the corner
LunasGuard: yes, Im not entirely sure how its going to work, only that it will.
Lol, okay.
I'll learn everyones streaming style in time. :3
shouldn't take too long
DoctoDoctorWho: (?_?)
I'm getting used to a few of them. :D
You can tell it's Caramel by the pony at the bottom left Zuxxez123 :3
Bronysith: is that a stick?
Alright, Caramel = pony buttom left corner. :3
Zuxxez123 I have been here or well full time or officially since around jan-feb 2012 and i've pretty much grown used to who is who. I never get mistaken for whos streaming
MOAR DAKKA!!!
killerpony7733: I'm 3 days old to the stream. I've got a few of them figured I think, but I am sure I will screw up a name or two.
Zuxxez123 Ah so a newcomer but yeah been a regular since that date or so yep :)
Zuxxez123 only that pony, though. Wrek puts Twi and his OC up sometimes, Sumi has his OC and occasionally Luna, I've seen Shizu put up Roseluck, and Phase4 will put his OC up.
I've also seen Nitt put up his once
Zuxxez123: dont worry my little pony, soon you shall learn the ways of the internet. And that will make you strong.
Er... What is OC?
original character
Zuxxez123, original character
Oh... Obviously... /).-
DoctoDoctorWho: my little pony :D
Dat God
Zuxxez123: Origonal Character, what you would look like as a pony
inb4 OC spam
Zuxxez123 And to that note remember alicorns is a sign of bad creativity and all
^ I thought an OC could be any new character, not just what one would look like as a pony.
yeah
but in the mlp fandom, we associate it with ponies usually
Pretty much.
Zuxxez123: But don't try to overdo it it has to be modest and pretty truthful to what you'd expect form MLP FIM
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349132341357.jpg imma go take a cold shower now... (be warned)
Alicorns = bad Juju. Got it.
I like to put my OC up when I stream.
ohai Nittany_Discord
Bronysith: My body is ready.
I'm not sure if I've ever seen a Nittany stream :<
Zuxxez123: only Lauren faust can have an alicorn OC and not have it be an overpowered mary sue.
Zuxxez123: Alicorns usually lead to dull characters man
I have a couple times
^^
Nittany_Discord Yeah it's nice and for some it helps remember who is streaming
Zuxxez123: like "my alicorn is the most powerful thing more powerful than the princesses"
Bronysith Pff that and the instant royalty status
My streams aren't too special.
hi Everypony :)
killerpony7733: no shit
Yuck, I hate those kinds of OCs.
Bronysith: I understand that, how can you have any faults if you are the creation of the three main lore based creations. Bah.
hi thelonepony
Ohai thelonepony
Hiya there thelonepony how has your day been?
Nittany_Discord: Don't say that. I'm sure plenty of people like your streams. :)
Nittany_Discord: hi Nit, your always special in the communities eyes
But I always like to play that one YTP.
great Zuxxez123 and you?
Sweetie Belle made punch. :D
Special in a bad way?
. . .
Hi, thelonepony :)
why is the empiral match playing in my head
Nittany_Discord: Good way. :P
no we love you not in a gay way
Hi AdamTheDuck AJIsAwesome|Homework Lunar_Brony

Zuxxez123 this is how NOT to do an OC

oh look, twilights got a new coat color... wait---
Bronysith: Might just be a kid's OC.
bai GilDash
Bronysith: Ughhh......
Argh darn crash
Nittany_Discord: NO EXCUSE
Bronysith: Right, no simple copy paste ponies, and no Alicorn crap. Got it.
Bronysith that last one wasn't even trying!
We would just have to wait
and this is just bullshit " I apologize for there being no image of this OC, but the description, I hope, will suffice. This is an actual character pitch for a pony roleplay. "C0L7 [with a 0 and a 7] is an Omnicorn: a majestic creature with four wings and ram's horns. The Omnicorns are far greater, larger and more powerful than the alicorns. Omnicorns are the only things that can permanently kill alicorns. C0L7 has killed 644 al

Oh please my OC is just fine. There is nothing wrong with it
Did you guys see Saturday's episode of Doctor Who?
Dovah: you take the cord
I hate these OC rules. I know there are good and bad characters, but making fun of people for having bad characters is wrong.
Amy: Nope. How is it?
wired or wireless xbox control?
needs to finsh OC
anyone read/hear the news?
Bronysith: uhhuh
Dovah: and wrap it around your neck until you pass out
/me doesn't have an OC :3
/me doesnt have one either
Dovah: just kidding, just use the USB part of it and plug it into a usb port
Bronysith: I tryed that like 8376$7 times1
Nittany_Discord: I can see that. I don't hate bad OCs, just wish they'd sprinkle a little creativity onto them.
I think he gets it guys, no alicorn OC's
It was good.
Dovah: is it a wired or wireless control?
But it was really sad...
AJIsAwesome|Homework, # Now lets all agree, to never be creative again. #
....
Dovah: ah then do what Bronysith said
Not that video.
NO.
I'm too picky with mine to finalize a product. Not happy with my eye colour, coat should be a different shade, a streak in my mane is either too light or too dark, etc . . .

g'night LunasGuard
Night LunasGuard
thanks thelonepony
You getting put under for the whole wisdom teeth thing? Because being put under is amazing. Went through that years ago, and don't remember a thing but waking up at home with my sister spoon feeding me soup.
.
Mozdoc: I'm getting local anesthic.
Mozdoc: I'll be awake for it.
that sucks
Mozdoc: sounds awesome
Zuxxez123: ask for general
or get hit with a hammer
Bronysith: I'm going to see how much the insurance is going to take off of the bill, because getting put under is like 500 bucks more...
Zuxxez123: id say its worth it
cause then it feels like it is over in 3 seconds
instead of 3 hours of being drilled and cut open
wut
Bronysith: agreed
<.<
Zuxxez123: cause even with local there is going to still be mental trauma
Bronysith: Yeah.. Making the extra money worth while...
Oh blood magpies
Yeah, they are leaving it open for me, if I want to get sedated or not.
why you such a bad chapter?
Zuxxez123: then get sedated
they prick your arm
The second the huge needle gets near my mouth, I'll probably cry out to get put out. Lol.
Zuxxez123: they insert an IV into your arm
they inject some medicine
Bronysith: morphine?
and in 30 seconds or less you're out like a light
and then in 2 seconds you wake up and 3 hours passed
Bronysith: I've been through getting put under, I've had surgery done. It's not that I am worried about it, it's the cost. Lol.
Good evening.
Zuxxez123: i say when it comes to pain
Evening Kinixys
just go through the extra bucks Zuxxez123
Evening Kinixys
Bronysith: Right. Starting to make sense. Lol.
Zuxxez123: how old are you? i was 14 when i got my wisdom teeth out
18
Got all four to get removed.
yea
get sedated beyond all belief
xD
you dont want to remember surgery
my brotehr actually woke up during it
The noise factor alone would be nightmare worthy, I'm sure...
Now I'm really thinking about it, I don't want to remember any of this. xD Sedation it is!
he woke up during surgery, they stopped, and gave him more anesthesia
Zuxxez123: smart man
It's pretty cool how it's all over in mere seconds.
Lunar_Brony: wait waht?
Lunar_Brony: lol wow
Kinixys: it feels like a few seconds
Lunar_Brony: Wha?
Lunar_Brony: What?!
Lunar_Brony: seriously?
Sounds like Lunar_Brony got some goooooood stuff.

Suddenly there's an ASSLOAD of war going on.
Mozdoc: suddenly?
J_E_Smith71: :O
Yeah. Legit. According to some neuro-somthing-ologist, I had a bad reaction to the drug that put me out for longer than intended
Talking about mouth surgery and sedatement, all while a helluva war is going on. I like it.
Zuxxez123: which war?
no serious damage, but I was eating ALOT
Lunar_Brony: That is bizzare. Was is pretty much a coma?
Lunar_Brony: That must've been horribly scary for your parents...
cowvarkian: the war on the stream.
In-game war.
Zuxxez123: lolderp, the stream tisnt working for me
Oh, okay. Lol.
anypony wana play borderlands 2 on pc for a bit?
Kinixys that's what I was told
taoumi: im kind of mellow, sorry
Hang on a sec i think i need to refresh the stream on my screen here and pop the stream out
Damn. Laptop is struggling now.
Zuxxez123 they were scared sick.
Bronysith: i don't understand that remark
Back with food.
. . .
dammit I'm hungry now
taoumi: i dont feel like it cause im not in the zone
taoumi: just played a shit load of doom and am wiped
Bronysith: a~~~
there we go
taoumi: if I had Boardlands 2 on PC, i'd play with you, but best I can do is 360 after a while...
Nittany_Discord perhaps you should plug it in and put it on max performance

hi CCCP
hi thelonepony
I think it's heat-related.

Zuxxez123: the surgery is the easy part if you are fully under, the recovery is the hard part
wisdom teeth?
ja
/me cringes
I've heard about what that's like
one girl I know couldn't talk for a week after getting hers pulled
Lunar_Brony: i was tripping balls
I had mine cut out. All of them at once. It.. stung... for about 5-7 days.
I don't think I have to get mine pulled
thank god for painkillers
ooh, I still need mine out
i never had my Wisdom teeth pull out
thelonepony: how old are you?
^
15
normal age would be 18 getting it out
i got mine out when i was 14 though
is it required to take out your wisdom teeth?

Fucking Reddit y u do that to me? :C
I have an eye that can tell which stuff is from the show and which is not.
*sort of have an eye
actually, science is getting close to a IRL "dubstep dishwasher" per say. One day, dishes may be cleansed purely by sound waves: no water, no soap, no heat. Sound.
AJIsAwesome|Homework: I can notice stuff like that also. :3
For example, the Picture Perfect Pony music video. I could tell that it was fan made from the first 7 seconds, I think.

Too bad my stream's getting tons of buffers.
My stream is running fine
Im Not A Fan Of Clone Wars
i hope this isnt as bad as that new clone wars show
Lucky you. :P
twilight_sprinkle: IT'S NOT.
2,14 no, this one is actually good
How many Star Wars animations are there?
well you need to refresh Laurayne
2,14 and the CG one should burn in hell
ah, Clone Wars by Genndy Tartakovsky - why did they got rid of that animation style anyway?
Caramel: ^^^
it'S luke chinwalker!
no wait
wrong trilogy
Lol.
It's very good.
The jedi are a *bit* Overpowered in this one, you have to admit
i liked the samurai jack style
this one :3
I knew this looked familiar!
Samauri Jack!
palpatine looks more like a gremlin here than yoda
the CG clone wars reviving darth maul with magic and making him an anrdoid makes me feel like NC did about the bat card
Unnr - well the individual cartoons are all of about 5-10 minutes long
yup. Genndy
they have to get a lot of things done quickly
gerneral gevus was a bad ass in this one

it's liek wat...45 min total
maybe
Only 45 minutes?
this one was really short
All those pew pews...
everything moves so fast!
it's liek the writers were on caffeine
adn the animators
and everyone,r eally
2,14 or they realized that future space warfare is boring when not done right
they wanted to tell the sotry. but only got 10 min maybe to do it
So, this is actually good? I won't lie, I never really gave the shows a chance...
pilot does not give a fuck
2,14 yes, this is actually good
2,14 it puts the CG one in its place
the cg one is meh
2,14 the CG was absolute shit and should be condemned
Caramel: To be fair star wars´ space combat was always based on WWII style dogfights
Lol. Alright, I'll be getting my popcorn ready then.
why are they so short though? were the on a tight budget?
2,14 this was back when cartoon network kicked ass
they ran them inbetwean shows
Dark_Horst: They were run as promos between regular cartoon network shows
2,14 and instead of commercials, they showed this
i miss Old Cartoon Network :(
cool stuff
Wait, Cartoon Network shows commercials now?
Why hello everypony
Hello sonicdude558
Hi sonicdude558
Dark_Horst, so the princess can ask that exact same question later "aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?" :)
/me wants to watch Hotel Transylvainia entierly because Genndy was the director
that tank seems to have a horrible design flaw
^
on the other hand, if they showed this instead of commercials, when are you supposed to go to the bathroom?
Dark_Horst: that's normal for EVERYTHING in this universe. Lol.
Yo what are we watching? Star Wars the Clone wars?
Ah, the Genndy Tartakovsky (sp?) Clone Wars
^ :D
2,14 twilight_sprinkle: it was only during a certain timeslot
2,14 if I remember correctly, it was during toonami, but I could be horribly mistaken
ah k
it was done on cartooncartoon fridays
444
Caramel, I was an avid watcher of Toonami during most of it's time, but I never saw this.
2,14 then taoumi must be right
also, nice dislogue
And since I just now came in at episode 4, I'm out of continuity.
*dialogue
2,14 honestly, it was a loooooong time ago
starwars
in a galexy far away
in a galaxy far far away
they're fucking up the whole planet
darn it taoumi
:P
this is genius tactics here
"They are kicking our ass, what do we do?!?!"
wheres the motorcycle
Caramel: I think they were shown during prime-time, but then Toonami ran them all at once afterwards
there we go

Welcome to Bronystate, SuperDERP! Make sure to read the rules. :)

I'll say the obivous cliche and say Welcome to Bronystate, SuperDERP ! Be sure to read the rul...oh AJ you beat me to it
Suddenly, classic Clone Wars?
in that one maybe.
2,14 meh, TBatB is an insult to Batman
well then made him less lame in the recent shows
Man, I can't believe I was missing this. >.<
so... we're watching the classic clonewars?
2,14 spent so much energy trying to make Aquaman cool
Caramel: idk, i thought some episodes were very good
cool
batman beyond was the shit!
Welcome to here, SuperDERP!
i am noticing a distinct lack of voices
yes it was Lyra`<3
Because I showed up that's why
Indeed.

Caramel: What about the two comedic episodes of Brave and the Bold with Bat Mite that Paul Dini wrote?
SuperDERP64?
sonicdude558 becuase it's cool
2,14 meh
dont see the problem, batman beyond was a cool show

...I actually didn't watch Brave and the Bold. I only saw the two Bat-Mite Dini eps
i know a superderp
spy zappin

im hoping this season will have a backstory about applejacks parents

And then badassery
Pyro!
SuperDERP nopony, Lyra` was just suspicious of your name and confused ith with one of our mods, SuperBrony64. Currently, he's NewSuperBronyU|AFK

The episode where Batman is trying to cheer up Aquaman was pretty good. I liked the humor in B&tB.

Yeah, this is the old Clone Wars series. The one everyone remembers fondly as "the one made by the guy who did Samurai Jack"
Ryunosuke: cause parking isnt allowed there

velcam to 89.9 ef em, get redi for sam soozing tunes
zacora?
"the heart of the cards!"
Genndy sure loves his hartman hips
Dken2021: Its biggest problem is that you know perfectly well how it will end. So it tries to build drama that it can't maintain.
wow SHE JUST noticed that..
well, shit
ROBOTS
hm, didnt know jedi could sense robots
fail sneek attack
So instead of "oh no, will Anakin be killed?" it's more like "okay, so what bullshit excuse allows Anakin to survive this?"
synchronized sabre dancing!
CK|Ded ah, I see
good night guise
dum droids
twilight_sprinkle: In theory, they can, they're just supposed not able to manipulate them like with humans.
Goodnight sonicdude558
night sonicdude558
CK|Ded well, maybe it's for those who don't know star wars that well
g'night sonicdude558
ABBALANCHE
nite sonicdude558
Which is why the part in Ep 1 where Qui-Gon clearly uses a mind trick on a DROID is canonical bullshit
Bye sonicdude558.
CK|Ded: well no i think they actually can manipulate them too, obiwan opened electrical doors with the force
yoda:O
THE SUN IS AN S
silly, this speaking is
twilight_sprinkle: Nope. The books make a very big deal out of droids not being manipulatives of a Jedi, at least not "mentally". Physically, sure, by shoving them around. But controlling their function, nope.
Whoa ugly close up
CK|Ded: well in the book version of ep3 it was explained how they can screw with the circuitry
uhh
hehehehehe
uhhh
oh crap
WHAT
shes azula!
Yoda. XD
dont trust her!
dat face
yoda you smug bastard
twilight_sprinkle: Which, again, is bullshit. It's supposed to be an incredible feat, one not actually attainable by a normal Jedi. >_>
pouty face is op
But then, little stuff like this is why the prequel really screws the pooch. It messes up even the smallest touches of canon. :/
08,01...
Yoda badass time?
08,01star wars.
Yoda badass time.
/me 08,01vacates
CK|Ded: well idk, it seems like a pretty plausible ability if you have some knowledge in engineering. say you use the force to block electricity or trigger something in the programming, which shouldnt take much power, but more preciseness
and the storm.... just stops?
what?
/me 08,01sprockets Bronysith
badass yoda
08,01Bronysith: jfgi
twilight_sprinkle: How do you use the Force, a physical manipulative tool, to alter programming, a digital and decidedly non-physical entity?
Breaking News! Dovah did his homework!!!
CK|Ded: programming is physical on the binary level, its a chemical principle of yes-no
well not always chemical i think
Dovah: Nice. I still have to do mine. :D
STOP SAYING THAT
dat phrase
/me has a bad feeling about stuff
That would require that a Jedi's power being able to manipulate binary switches in a microprocessor.
Which they can't. >_>
why hello there twilight amadala
sand people... oh hoth?
2,14 really guys? technical arguments about star wars? Why can't you just have a little bit of suspension of disbelief and enjoy the god damn lasers?
Er no, they would have to be able to physically adjust the switches. :P
i think it's more a matter of resolution than strength
Caramel: because its a fun discussion
because people are fickle
Damaging the processors wouldn't mentally manipulate the droids.
....
bait
Star wars is pretty much about lasers now.
CK|Ded: well manipulating their decisions might be pretty op
also, they would have to be able to fluidly think in binary to be able to actually do anything effective to the droid
13Caramel: silly val say it right
13BRONYSTATE
13LESS QQ
13MORE PEW PEW
Caramel: I'm enjoying :P
lol Shizuka
2,14 Shizu: rofl, well said
star wars isnt all about lasers, you know
08,01Shizuka: <3
they'd also need to know the froids exact program
Hehe, you're right Shizuka XD
anyway i think i hear my laundry calling, brb
no need to fear the jedi are here
twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, which is why I said that the books made such a huge deal out of how extremely difficult it is for a Jedi to manipulate the mental functions of a droid.
It all comes back to lasers, in the end.
there were only 2 edi in that thing?
DOO-KU
who the hell cleans the toilets?
KAAAAAAAAAN
twilight_sprinkle: And that's also why I actually have issues with Qui-Gon manipulating the droid's thought process early in the movie. 'cuz he actually shouldn't be able to. XD
Damage it, yeah, or throw it around. Mind trick it? Er, no.

DUH
silly, clone trooper, you're not supposed to hump the tree

that's just silly
08,01you'd think that people with upstream access woudl know that you don't commit non-working changes

2,14 surprise surprise, Anakin led a bunch of people to their deaths
Zecora!

NOOOOOO random R4 unit
08,01or rather, you can commit them, but you don't push them

:D
the lightsabers are red, you know she's a sith
what the . . . creepy metal lady
:D
Oh, right, this.
so that'S what jack did before she landed in the space prison'S fridge
This is pretty sweet too.
Caramel: Actually I was following up on the NOOOOO Trooper line
But then, everything in this series runs on Rule of Cool.
I didn't know Star Wars had an animated series.
2,14 I meant from Anakin
*Everything*. No exceptions.
I knew they had Clone Wars.
2,14 was more a comment on his priorities :P
Oh whoops
i can't get over how FUCKING RETARDED anakin looks
awesome mini movie, but fuck
The art is stylized.
This looks like Star Wars in Samurai Jack style
it's like looking at a broken mirrir
mirror
ASoftFluffyThing: Same team
2,14 ASoftFluffyThing: made byt he same people
no fly. jump good
J_E_Smith71, Caramel Aaah I knew that style was famliar
ahhhhh sameri jack good timez goooooood timez
ASoftFluffyThing: Well, it WAS directed and produced by Genndy Tartakovsky, who did Samurai Jack.
he adapted to her fighting style awfully quick
2,14 one of these days I'll stream Jedi Outcast and Academy
Kencolt: That explains it then. Because I was going to be a smartass and say "When did Samurai Jack become a Jedi?"
somepony shud stream sameri jack
shit just got real
scout19_tf2: Well Wrek did a couple months ago
Lightsaber fight in the rain. Who's gonna get electrocuted first?
i wasnt here a couple monthes ago
2,14 as Luna did a couple months before that
Lightsabers are not electric.
there is never enough samurai jack
2,14 she has the high ground anakin!
yeah, but he's got augmentation boni

Holy Smokes. It's a Worgen Jedi.
Once more, without a WORD of spoken dialogue (except a scream), this series conveys Anakin's slow fall to the Dark Side better than the prequels EVER did

Eddmario well, in November atleast. Being North o' the border, I get Thanksgiving this coming weekend
whats that

Another thing I like about this series: Clone troopers aren't just pointless characters, they DO SHIT.
I love how they just stare at it
lol dem tectures
Lunar_Brony: So you live in Texas?
CK|Ded: the ones doing shit are an elite commando
Watch this, seriously. THEY DO SHIT.
that gun
ok one moment
needs more barrels
lol dat big gun
11,02Moo? o.o
This is how the troopers should always have been.
Eddmario no, Canada
Moo :3
NewSuperBronyU, moo
Hey, it's a NewSuperBronyU
NewSuperBronyU: heard people talking about him. :P
11,02O.O
Are they like the super elite?
You know, they really should render the CG at the same framerate as the animation so it doesn't stick out so much
CK|Ded: they did stuff in ep3 too, it just wasnt the focus of the movie, whereas these are more action shorts
NewSuperBronyU, you missed out on epic mooage
yes NewSuperBronyU, but you missed it :(
11,02D:
11,02;~;
Kinixys: if they got collored armor..then yes
Ah, so you live in Northern Wisconsin then...
twilight_sprinkle: What did the troopers do in Ep 3?
AdamTheDuck LoLz, mooage
http://imgur.com/a/k4bRR

CK|Ded: they were winning the war.
tf2 in a nutshell
overkill
abrony IKR?
Xcom accuracy right here
00,03Guys... Excel is HARD O_O
Thrackerzod: xD So true.
CK|Ded: Killed bunch of Jedi
There's no kill quite like overkill
CK|Ded: just because it wasnt constantly shown, it doesnt mean they werent doing anything
twilight_sprinkle: You're misunderstanding.
hai
hi ScootaExcel. The program, right?
Ohey Scoot-Scootaloo *hugs*
this was given out at a club in Hollywood to promote the game before it was released. and to game journalists as i just learned
hia :3
ScootaExcel: whats so hard about it?O.o
00,03Yeah that. It's a jerk :|
00,03and evenin', newfriends!
twilight_sprinkle: In the movies, they're delegated to secondary characters with no major roles and no crowning moments of badass.
Tell me about it :/
CK|Ded: played republic commando?
told ya...PLOT ARMOR
they need ded
ded
twilight_sprinkle: In this series, you get to see the value of the clone troopers and how they contributed to the war effort with their own awesome moments. Even the new Clone Wars series does a better job of this than Ep 3 did.
BLOW EM UP
lol
kaboom
Scoot-Scootaloo: You missed some MLG Star Wars.
CK|Ded: because its not what the movie is about. there were series like this for that, if youll notice, this series has practically no plot, where as the movie was more focused on story
00,03I know :'(
Scoot-Scootaloo and epic mooage
but you wouldn't give a sh*t . . .
wat
00,03AHHH what the hell is that?!?!
Deku Tree?

in star wars republic commando you lead a squad of those colorful troopers. nice game

Scoot-Scootaloo what, mooage?
Wait, Qui-Gon was dead by the time Anakin actually started his training...
00,03No, the ugly cow looking kid!
hmmm
Six Jedi, bro
oh cool
oh
The padawan still counts
Eddmario...yeah obi-wan was "the chosen one" at one point...but he proved false
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Plushie Compilation #86

wtf
AKU
Scoot-Scootaloo hey, that could be your kid
what is that
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
Scoot-Scootaloo, oh that's little Anakin
hes a tree
what the fuzz
Did I hear TWO of the people from the Boast Busters script reading at Canterlot Gardens in this scene?
Was that tree beard?
fluttertree is a jedi?
00,03Dken2021: :O
Eddmario mmhmm, and it was smexy
twilight_sprinkle: But that's part of the problem.
grumble
lol
it looks more like the DISCORDED fluttershy sleeping (whatever)
Scoot-Scootaloo: HOW THE FUCK WAS THAT SPOILERS?!?!?!?
Oh go stuff it, Treebeard, it's going to happen anyways
SPOILED IT
THE GOOD STAR WARS CARTOON
and shit
THANK YOU
oh god that expression
00,03Eddmario: Because I didn't see it yet :P
yo StinkomanFan
lol those faces
every expression from Yoda in this Cartoon is gold
dem.......things
and out comes samurai jack
looks like a scene out of the MIB cartoon
See all those BG charactors? They ALL have backstories and names
Scoot-Scootaloo: It's not spoilers if the VAs are mentioned AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VIDEO!
twilight_sprinkle: The issue is that the clones had no characterization. They were mindless bodies just like the droids, which is an epic fail because it neglects to focus on WHY they were winning the war. A big part of why they were winning is because the clones were human. Human thought and emotion.
:|
wow -lol
boooooo
00,03Still counts as spoilers...
then the y had sex
O_O
Padme?
that was quick
twilight_sprinkle: Also this series has more story, and a better story, than Ep 3. >_>
Cinnabons...
twilight_sprinkle: The new Clone Wars series is better at it too.
and then comes the angst
CK|Ded: star wars was never about just fighting, there are other shows for that, so there is n need for heroic trooper moments in the movie. it was explained why theyre winning the war, because they had more thought variety. and no, this series has practically no story, its just war. ep3 had plenty of story
Wait, is that Tara Strong?
Padme, your eyes are kind of large
jedis have wedding ceremonies tho
her voice is fimiliar

death by execution
CK|Ded: its nothing new, this was done in ep2.
the most deadly kindm of death
its a rape
Why does Yoda ALWAYS look pissed in this?
you know
Punch in face padawan I will
then he twitched and mutilated anakin
thats not exactly SAFE
and then he burned his ear off
Because he's the Yode
anikan is just trying to get his numbers up on his char sheet
OW GAWD MAH SHOULDERS
IcY_ my thoughts exactly
well that seems kinda over-the-top for modest jedi
Complete douche you are Anakin.
geez, the don't realize how dangerous those things are? can slice an arm off like butter
sooo what's everyone doing in this dead room ?
He's getting laid tonight
that's so cool
:D
Lurking.
:$
Dealing with massively screwed-up Skype chat.
dem tie fighters
twilight_sprinkle: Actually, it wasn't. This level of care and development isn't present in Ep 2 or 3. And mind, I actually LIKE Ep 3. XD

Eddmario yes, but a lightsaber leaves little mess

2,14 for some reason, they decided to make it a single movie
oh

how long is it? o 3o
2 jedi
2 :p

Lol, that guy's so black...

Welp you're boned

twitchy twitchy twitch
2 jedi and an army of clones
because i didnt expect people to keep talking about it on IRC -_-
eye twitch when youre gunna get raped
11,02Dat 64 ping
I take it on the DVD they're edited together as a single movie, leaving out the credits and tite for each episode
POSE!
*title
wow
You're not on Skype, I can't bitch at you there.
finaly
his hair grew fast
NewSuperBronyU, i ping you because i wub you :3
i got the head right
CK|Ded: i say it had way more development than here. anaking argued with obiwan in ep 2, its nothing new. as for him becoming jedi, thats not really an important scene. so far nothing important has really happened
11,02Lyra`: o////o
Caramel: at least they didn't make anikin look really retarded in this one... he still look retarded though :I
Yeah this was in chapters when it first aired on TV
pew pew pew pew pew
/me glomps Lyra`
^-^
RAWR!
Actually.
ACTUALLY
Eddmario: I have the DVD. You can watch it as a single movie-- or watch the eps separately, withy breaks intact.
i remember this on. it was on cartoon network, right?
You probably have the right idea.
mmhmm
wolfman jedi?
eeyup
rawr
Hm, can Anakin use the force with his robot arm? It's never mentioned AT ALL through all 6 movies if he can or not
twilight_sprinkle: The arguments in this series help establish actual development. The arguments in Ep 2 tend to be over trivial and stupid shit that doesn't develop the characters. >_>
your still in it
she digs scars
and fake arms
lol
I don't remember him having that scar in episode 3 at all...
a scar, he's truely evil then
lol
Obiwan, sleeping in the gutters
That's awesome
DAT BAD NEWS
thought i would get kicked to make room for someone active
lol
Eddmario: Well, since she's got no problem slinging the force as Vader...
CK|Ded: the argument here was kinda the same. anakin being brash, obiwan trying to teach him patience and control. its happened both in ep2 and 3
XD
2,14 So a bit of insight to this particular movie: they were basically forced to address the *many* issues episode 3 provided
he'S like "fuck this shit"
yum
that lunch
how long are these episodes?
lol as of now we dont need to do that
yummy
Best lunch ever
There's an upper limit?
:D
LOL
Meal worms and grubs =D
2,14 such as why greivus sucks ass, how Obi Wan knows Cody, yada yada
numnumnum
twilight_sprinkle: Also, nothing important has happened? The only way you can say that is by not paying attention. XD This series has already explained Anakin's ascension, helped further illustrate his fall to the dark side, the intro of Grevious, etc
....
Anyway yeah you're still there.
to calls supposively
yummy worm
24 max
eww
grubs
that works?
Sounds legit
I hadnt thought of that
yeah you showed me
however, ive seen the Luna group make a call with 40+...
what a plan
"just great"
.....
beat me too it CK|Ded
dat quote
....DAT TRIBUTE LINE
my skype crashed shortly afterward, so its still a myth
yummy food and yummy smells in a yummy place
Did you catch that?
"What an incredible smell you've discovered." <---- Han's line to Chewie in Ep 4
nice
....
THAT line
Its probably one of the rariest items in your collection
Gumballs?
CK|Ded: none of that is important, none of it influences the story. its all been done in ep3. and there doesnt have to be a 30 minute intro battle to show theres this dude grievous whos dangerous
>alternatives to fighting
luna group ?
>mind=blown
Save Luna
those...
wookiees?
oh no
noob
wookies
you lost me at insted of punching things
:O oh noze
SHIT RUUUUUUN
d'aww, they're so cute <3
OH MY GOD, what have they done to the wookies?!
haven't started skype in quite a while
soo no idea
Yeah, NOBODY can draw wookies right...
they look more like monkeys than ever
cis gona win dis time
there mowing our lawn :[
Leaving chat!
/me ninjas out
twilight_sprinkle: No, none of that was addressed in Ep 3. Grevious just shows up without explanation, Anakin is suddenly a Knight, and the fact that he's Palpatine's bitch is unexplained. Seriously, did you watch both of those movies? O.o
"This is Chewbacca. This does not make sense!:
*"
The skip between 2 and 3 explains NONE of that stuff.
dawww
dem blue elephanrs :V
Sad Max Rebo
i thoguht friday was movie night
it is
Saturdy is Euro Movie Night
flutterchu: It is. This is just a random suprise thing
I SWEAR the VA for Dooku sounds familiar in this...
so what "episode" are we watching
flutterchu: The 2003 Clone Wars cartoon
CK|Ded: it doesnt Have to be explained, since when are movies required to make 30 minute intros for every character? movies always have to make a choice of what to make more detailed, and what not. there is no need to make any intro to characters like grievous, because he is a robot, he was created, not raised with an incredible personal story
the GOOD one
oh okay
YEN SID! THAT'S where I heard his voice before...
why doesn't grievous ever use the force?
What the FUCk is up with Palpatine's sleeves?
anakin
2,14 Grievous isn't a jedi
pimp sleeves
2,14 he has no control over the force
since it's FINALLY OCTOBER happy nightmare night
twilight_sprinkle: They don't need to give 30 minute intros, but they DO have to explain new characters. There is no reason for them not to. That is poor storytelling, throwing in new characters without explanation.
nerf_soldier: He's not actually a Jedi/Sith. He's just tained in using Lightsabers
Eddmario epic sleevs of win
i think grievous has some feel for the force though
gevus is just a badass
but he can swing a light saber
2,14 nah, he's just a robot with lightsabers
yeah
2,14 and as you'll see soon (spoiler warning) his lack of force powers is his undoing
Well....
hes not a robot, hes an android
Caramel: Cyborg technically
Caramel: cyborg
he ahs a living brain
Thought it was a cyborg.
2,14 whatevs
grivous is human body parts in a robot
Technically he's a cyborg, yeah
hm, i think i read somewhere taht he did have a slight onnection to the force
Which is why he dies the way he does in Ep 3
2,14 point is, he can't do jedi shit
He's more machine now, than man.
Twisted and evil.
-lol
yes sir
\yes sir
lol
Squirrel!
How is he able to anticipate the Jedi movements without connection to the force?
right away sir
twilight_sprinkle: I just looiked up the General a bit ago on Wokiepedia. He's got no actual force sense or connection-- and resents the fact to the extent he wants to kill all jedi.
its all lethal
sir
CK|Ded: the reason for them not to, is because its a movie, it has to be done in 2 hours or so, they cant spend that time displaying backstories for every character like cody, grievous, etc. they arent even real people, they were made, they have no wortwhile backstory to be displayed
Snarf?
shoot it all
2,14 the same way duelists can anticipate swordplay?
STOP SAYING THAT
2,14 it's called technique
hm well ok Kencolt
oh shi--
twilight_sprinkle: Grevious is a major character in the story. >_>
er mahgerd
is it dangerous sir?
can i shoot it sir?
yus
twilight_sprinkle: You can't introduce a major character without explanation, or you SUCK at storytelling.
Kinixys watch bidy language, fast reflexes, skill at swining a sword of pure energy
*body
In my opinion, it's best to drop hints to a character's backstory as you go, rather than explaining it all at once as soon as they arrive
rahhhhhhhhh
wut
uh
2,14 hey look! it's Avatar now
NAVI
IKR?
ehhhh.......
what he said?
"I'm pissed off!"
dem native navies
more like smurf mixed with avatar Caramel
twilight_sprinkle: And actually there's a LOT of backstory to Grevious. The problem is, none of it comes up in the movies at all. He literally shows up.
kill all the natives
No shit, Windu
oh nose
*DRAMITIC HAND MOTIONS*
dem dance moves
no shit Yoda
Hey they do like the things from Avatar
Oh, right, and this is explaining why Ep 3 opens with a massive assault
Cameron must have stole them for this
eeyup
Mombasa All over
CK|Ded: hes just an advanced robot, like a miniboss, he doesnt have to have a backstory. if he does, then so does cody, and half the other characters in sw, which would take 3 more movies. grievous backstory was implied as such: hes a robot, an experimental model created for the soul purpose of killing and leading droids, there is nothing tmore to his character, hence no need for an big intro
Because Ep 3 botched basically everything in the story department. >_>
go away lucifur
If that's the case there should be far more 'Grievous'es.
It's Jedi Satan
wouldn't it be that avatar looks like those creatures since this came out first?
cat women arent happy
twilight_sprinkle: He's a cyborg, number one. :P Number two, he's the second major villain in Ep 3. That merits some explanation, period.
2,14 >implying Cameron didn't steal a shitload of ideas for Avatar
why is this scene so slow when the previous scene was a huge battle set up?
ahh yeah
Avatar is basically Pocahontis i space
avatar is basically pocahintas in space
FACE!
then anakin became a furry
dat high guy
uuugh
dude im so high
Destard?
that chief is crazy relaxed.
crazy high actually
i think he's dead
He ooks DEAD
I think their chief is really high.

EPISODE 3 ENDING FORSHADOWING!
I don't care what he's on, I want some of that, man!
oh noooooooooooo
-lol dat panic.
oaaahhh noaah
2,14 he claims
twilight_sprinkle: No, he's a cyborg. Now I again must question if you've paid attention. He clearly has human parts in Ep 3, which is why he dies. >_>
BRB shower
2,14 when in reality all he wanted was a trippier version of Furngully
Derpy_Hooves, and Pocahontas is older
furngully?
2,14 an old animated movie
Fern Gully
yes, Ferngully
2,14 was pretty good
whatev
hai everypony
awww dayum
hi princess
I hate James Cameron for Titanic
Windu can fly
princess hia dere
Hi princess :3
lol wat
its like a horse
Hi dari
More Badass Windu
....forgot about that one
because that's how programming works right?
Hey
hi, princess
CK|Ded: thats not imporant...his character was limited to that of a killing machine, his bioparts were just an attempt to give him a connection to the force so he could hunt down jedi
Windu usese force to hax.
AJIsAwesome|Homework dat tab fail
droid jet rodeo
I don't think that actually works. XD
hai :3 this seems good
AJIsAwesome|Homework . . . or not
ima be on chatz n on rp so brb
WE GOT 4 ON OUR TAIL :o take them out :|
Lunar_Brony: :P
Oh, is this the original Clone Wars series?
Windu is a badass
DocSane eeyup, the good one
needs more screen clutter
This would be fun in Battelfront eh?
NEED DICTORS, BUBBLES ARE FREE
Thrackerzod it IS
TACKLE EVERYTHING!
he deserves sun glasses
You know what this needs? Samurai Jack.
URA
13ded
DocSane you mean it's not samurai jack enough?
Not sure if someone already posted it(probably did), but still: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CtZqyZ-WywE/UGnZVc3v8mI/AAAAAAAAAY0/zBppYyfVm6s/s400/Screen-shot-2012-10-01-at-12.40.02-PM.png
raaaahhh
DocSane: I think it might be the same animators who worked on this
yeah... right
attaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack
Eddmario: Hence my suggestion.
SirGanjalf yup, it happened, expect relief and anticipation
dat swarm
GET REPS ON THE CAPS!
SirGanjalf: Eyup, I mentioned that about 10-20 minutes ago right when I got here
so many clones:O
twilight_sprinkle: And if his role were minor, that'd be fine. But it's not. He is the guy who takes over after Dooku is cut out of the script, making him the second major villain and the most visible of the bunch. You can't just have him show up and say nothing about him.
This looks very similar to the art style of Milton J. Pool.
oh well...
someone get that guy some aspirin
she is so FUCKING old
Why am I still awake?
btw what's this?
Dreads needed to go into siege mode, and Carriers in Traige
back
Wirisme because Bronystate is awesome
:)
CK|Ded: his character was pretty much that of a robot, he doesnt have to be a dostoevsky character to be a mostly-robot villain. he was created for killing, so he has no character.he may have been a major character in terms of holding the jedi slightly back, but plot-wise, he changed Nothing for the story, so eh wasnt really a major character for the story
lol troll
Wirisme: Star Wars Clone Wars
THATS A SHE?
I see
Yoda is so OP -lol
IKR?
Obi troll
"What's this" *yoda appears*
Why does it keep switching between two unrelated scenes?
no go back inside
their expressions are almsot as good as 60s spidey
youre grounded
goddamn kermit\
dem dance moves
Applechip: Showing what's going on with Anakin and Obi-Wan on that planet and what's happening with this battle
Yoda is OP. Requires nerf.\
lol
leeches!
blue poop
twilight_sprinkle: I can't agree with that since he's effectively the leader of the Separatists given that the true leader never shows his face. >_>
tattoo leeches
That armpit hair
CK|Ded: the true leader is dooku, not grievous, and hes shown his face. the true true villain is secret
back
Dooku dies at the start of the film, twilight_sprinkle.
boss clone
sucking out your blood and pumping ink instead...
Grevious is stated to take over after them.
CK|Ded: and?
looks like an avatar
-lol Horsey just messed that robut up :3
kung force
Holy shit
again with the punching of the robots
XD
lol
And i thought Yoda was OP
CK|Ded: yeah and they lost pretty fast after that. hes an assassin, not a war leader
Ryunosuke becuase it's coolz!
....
everyones watching star wars while im watching seinfeld
;O I SAW BLOOD
BOOM
oh shi--
and hes just chilling XD
perv
KABLOOEY
Oh NOOOOO
that palpatine?
that was hilarious
Buytoast: Yes
ohai Buytoast
Palpatine. XD
ehh.........
why does he look like a sleepless fatheaded frodo
bewm
No.
stormtroopers have the aims of, well, stormtroopers
aww the blue guy
<=That scene needed Wilhelm's Scream
chainsaw?
lol
-lol :D
dat button
i heard a chainsaw?
:D
CK|Ded: but now youre talking about development. developing a robot-assassin character is pointless. and what does this series offer that the movie doesnt, its pretty much shown that hes just dookus student and he kill stuff, same was shown in the movie
abrony you did
slowest elevato in the world
You guys are so dead
Even in the future you have to wait on elevators
Awesome.
woah
graaaaahgul
oh thse things
this is why elevators suck
i hated talking to them in kotor
Roar :3
it was just bulblublublbu
twilight_sprinkle: This series gave him an introduction. If he had shown up in Ep 3 without even this much, everyone would be bitching. :P
hia :3
ohai
-lol grievous is so OP.
I find this part amusing
lol
well damn
twilight_sprinkle: Also, he's a general in the army prior to Dooku's death. So yes, he IS a leader in the army.
CK|Ded: but, again, what did this intro offer? nothing really. it just slows down the pace
safty ball
did the cis win yet
Fus-ro-dah?
Greivous is OP. Mod should nerf
Grevious.rar
fail
twilight_sprinkle: It explains where the fuck he came from.
Wilhelm!
and there he was
that wilhelm
dat wilhem scream
heard that
wow missed every attack -lol
lol fail cuz cant jump
There he is!:D
It's Star Wars. Gotta have Willhelm
IKR?
^^
CK|Ded: he came from a lab, which was obvious enough in the movie
Suddenly Anakin is a Celtic warrior...
its a trap
magmablock: EVERYTHING needs Willhelm scream. Hell, doesn't MLP: FIM have a version of it?
DAT DODGE
Hello~

hey Emmie
Welcome back, Ponies47 :)
oh shit he's going to oz
awwwww so much learning!!!!
trippy
twilight_sprinkle: So basically you're fine with major characters not having explanations. Good for you. Unfortunately that's not how good storytelling works.
don't lose your house anakin
i think the lsd just kicked in
hey Ponies47
what is this?
Tanks thelonepony princess and AJIsAwesome|Homework :3

Ghost arm cave drawing guy is so OP.

dat anakin analogy
Ponies47: do you find it weird buying a pic of applejack beating up applebloom?
ouch, genocide
wut
THE FUCK WAS THAT?
Lots of Episode 3 forshadowing...
Dat music
brewam
dodododoodododdoodod! DA DA! DA DA!
mostly but not completly
twilight_sprinkle: And the problem is, the fact that you can imagine his backstory doesn't excuse them from not having one.
lol nope.avi
asplosions
Where are they coming from?
O.o
CK|Ded: i dont see the interest in a movie spelling everyhting out for me. hes not a major character for the entire star wars saga, and giving him a fight intro like here would be pointless, waste time and slow down the pace
BOOOOM
twilight_sprinkle, CK|Ded: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2375/
twilight_sprinkle stop arguing :c
please da- ple-please
the argument isnt going anywhere
twilight_sprinkle: Not giving him an intro is not acceptable in proper storytelling. I'm fine with you choosing to forgive it. That doesn't make it okay.
2,14 >implying internet arguments ever go anywhere
Out of curiosity, would a bollywood movie count as A or B?
ok
twilight_sprinkle: Yeah but this was right before Episode 3 came out. This made us think that Grevious was going to be badass...but then Episode 3 came out and it was a let down
I missed an aruement?
http://static4.fjcdn.com/comments/OMG+are+we+going+to+discuss+opinions+now+thats+sooo+_e9a38ab665b358dda2dfeb3882f1ac8d.png SHUT UP
c:
*arguement
2,14 Unnr|Angst I'd have to see the imdb, but given the stereotype I'd have to guess B
Ha!
nope
ill stop. altho why am i always the first one being told to stop, i dont even say anything personal >.>
Emmie: If you have a problem with people actually discussing what they're watching, then there's always the option of not reading the chat. >_>
soooo many trains
He WAS badass-- until Windu got in a parting shot that crippled his already ill-adapted systems.
Caramel: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2057441/
oh shi--
It seems fitting
J_E_Smith71: well thats another matter, i suppose they couldve made him cooler, thats true
i liek trains
Dun dun dun
Emmie: Don't tell other people to stop discussing something if they're enjoying it just because you aren't, that's kind of dickish. Honestly.
lol
Oh crud, meant to send that as a PM...
>_<
:D
That troll move
lol capes suck
:D
YOINK!
friggin trains! :D
2,14 yeah, that's probably B
Reason Not To Wear A Cape #56
i liek trains
It was suprisingly good
NO CAPES!
taoumi: so does sheldon
CK|Ded, I don't have a problem seeing you "dicuss" the chat, you're just kind of arguing and going nowhere with it. The text walls are kind of irritating and I just made one so I'll be quiet nao. >-<
CK|Ded: last thing-there is no such thing as "proper story telling". if there were, then all stories would be the same. id prefer hints over obvious expositions of everything in the movie
Unnr|Angst: We've already streamed the most expensive Bollywood movie in history as B movie so...
fact: people should never EVERa have capes
SirGanjalf what was that?
for you have seen what happend
princess yup
00,03Capes are MLG~
SirGanjalf: but robot wasn't all that well meta-rated
princess: what about long coats?
twilight_sprinkle: No, there is such a thing as proper storytelling. It doesn't mandate every aspect of the design, but it does instruct "best policy" designs.
/me has never watched star wars
derpy advice #38 when you liek star wars.......youre doomed
Lunar_Brony: Einhiran(or sth) a.k.a. "roboda"

That was a great stream Caramel hope I can see more of these in my times here. :D

CrimsonPhoenix: I remember Disney had a show that did this thing. That show with Drew Carrey where you had headphones on in a pitch black room
CrimsonPhoenix: I did. I need a new camera. Guess I should get one for my birthday or somthing
Ponies47, next thing I'll know is that you would wish to become director one day

Lyra`: that finger placement...
SaxyPretender: ....
Ponies47, but seriously you could become director
rawr!
like i was saying to CrimsonPhoenix
you just have to film EVERYTHING at young age
i could have made a penis joke there
Anyone heard the song Death Waltz or U.N. Owen Was Her?
CrimsonPhoenix: My mother says I'm a good actor. But I do like to work with camera's myself
0,14the latter's from Touhou right?

NewSuperBronyU: why, it just like a wii remote, why didnt they change the design?
11,02Because the Wii Us are going to be in black and white :)
Dken2021: Based on the box, I'm guessing they're Wii Motion Plus Controllers designed for the Wii U.
one sec
lol
o.O
i have to admit, Super Mario Sunshine was an awesome game
is this a friend match or random cuz the feed is buffering alot for me
i loved super mario sunshine!
^
noooooooooooh haha
FlutterMEDIC: very underrated
FlutterMEDIC: Hard to deny that fact.
Why is it always SuperBrony and Derpy? And always playing the same character?
mmhmm, but I hate Corona mountain soo much
^
beacuse they pre record these games
Corona Mountain SUCKED
08,01FUUUUUUUUUUCK
ok I think I really need some sleep now, I'll see you all later :)
I was laughing so hard haha
08,01i bricked my fucking tablet
corona mountains not that bad
NewSuperBronyU is actually of doing something else right now
Bye Wirisme :)
night Wirisme
break, or brick?
Night Wirisme
Lyra`: One in the same Lyra...
the only bad thing about Corona Mountain is the FUCKING BOAT
what does brick mean agian?
08,01i tried to flash a new kernel to it
Brick... did you wash it?
08,01bricked = it is now just a very expensive paperweight
DANG.
?
I got an idea *evil creepy laugh*
that sucks
08,01Unnr|Angst: galaxy tab 2
exactly FlutterMEDIC, so little space, so many times to mess up >.<
omg
justin beiber is a little shit from what i hear
so much lag for me D:
08,01i think the flash program must have written to the wrong area of flash
Dken2021: have you watched Chuggaaconroy's lets play of Super Mario Sunshine?
giant inky octopus
08,01AJIsAwesome: i'm going to ask tomorrow

Adjeca
the person who dresses as goofy at Disneyland says he was barking orders at people and being an ass to everyone. he wanted to punch him while dressed
What did you buy I gotta know :)
08,01AJIsAwesome: i used to work in a phone shop, so if they can get it done, at least i'll get a discount
Nice.
08,01because i've saved that guy's arse many a time
flutterchu: im the P and your the INKIE

hm. just that one thingie
08,01Zuxxez123: it's unlikely he'll be able to do anything, though
the skylanders box?
Zuxxez123: and suddenly you realise its someone's backside
yep
Lunar_Brony: IKR? :O
actually i think i'm gonna get everything you linked, lol
BUFFER
except for the expensive guide
:P
FlutterMEDIC: Dat plot. :P (There is no buffer)
gg
11,02gg :)
Lunar_Brony: whos giu the virtual haircut?
yeah I posted a cheaper guide
and its the exact same thing
11,02If anypony wants to join, they're free to do so o3o
giving*
I'll see if I can in later days. :D
I would love to get my ass kicked on a live stream where everyone can mock my skills. :P
PEACH
If your getting that guide book, can you send me a pic of the poster?
of course :)
I used to be a master with Mario and Marth.
thanks
wait, why would you choose Peach?
superretroworld a guy who, apparantely, was called Luigi. LovelyVirus on YouTube
Well, I wouldn't say "master", just very good at using them.
FlutterMEDIC: dont underestimate peach. She can be vicious, hehe
FlutterMEDIC sorry, chat lag, only watched the parts at the beginning
so many terrible but funny spyro videos...
Sylandest: Exactly.
Especially Melee.
HER AIM IS GETTIN' BETTER!
hehe
The Melee CPUs actually taught me how to powershield. :$
ike is my favorite
QSound Labs
If the poster is really good ill probably buy the guide
oh yea, peach is deadly if you knwo how to use her
Ive been wanting to buy the guide for the game anyways
Ha-Cha!
especially mastering hovering and attacking
AJIsAwesome: i also love dodging in mid air
I remember the impact would cause an explosion.
Never underestimate Peach's hips. :D
It's really hard to fight Mr. Game & Watch. Just from looking at him it's nearly impossible to judge what his actions will be.
heh
I said HER AIM IS GETTIN' BETTER!
Applechip: True, considering his frames of animation are very short.
http://www.ebay.com/itm/BUCKNER-GARCIA-Pac-Man-Fever-LP-Columbia-1982-w-Inner-Sleeve-MINT-/200819269438?pt=Music_on_Vinyl&hash=item2ec1c2df3e&nma=true&si=iTAwlv4DkcASvF3rGawy3V653p0%3D&orig_cvip=true&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2557

You see, it's funny because HER AIM IS GETTIN' BETTER!
what be this?
its a vinyl record

o.O
It has songs of all the popular arcades in the 80s
Ive been searching for a mint one for a long time

I plan to display it if I ever do find one at a decent price :P
okay my computer is being very mean right now
Dken2021: http://theforvm.org/files/thats-the-joke.jpg
can i just join in or do i need a friend code?
i'd call the ending price as a decent one
the cover isnt good enough quality for me
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZk37MDWQKQ
I think you need to do the friend code crap first... I may be wrong....
This is one of the songs on the vinyl
darnit
DanteD: you need a friend code
yeah
oh the friendcode, such a tedious manner
hehe
Where'd she pull that radish from?
i gots mah wii set up with mah fancy wii remote :D
If you listen to the words of the song
the ground of course
He literally says what you can do in the game
gg
11,02gg :)
I got a hard drive for my wii, but I don't have anything to rip my games with :(
so should i try without the friend code?
whoever lost took a dive!
Whoa! NewSuperBronyU! You crazy!
11,02O.O
it was rigged, and i want my moneys back from the bet!
mfw SB doesn't have "I LYKE PONIEZ :3" as a taunt
DanteD: Send him PM's about this stuff, so he sees it when he isn't fighting.
One of my taunts is HER AIM IS GETTIN' BETTER!

Bit late in the night for me, otherwise I would. Thanks though.
Soon I'm going to move the Wii into my room, rent SSBB and play with you guys, even if it just to get my ass kicked. :3

so youre saying im just another face in the crowd?!
kirb*
i thought i was special too you!
11,02We kept yelling at the guy who played Kirby 'NO STOP, DON'T LET HIM DO IT D:'
Lol.
Everyone think's they are special that's the problem with the world.....cept in MLP it's true.
But I am special...
My mom tells me that every morning.

twilight_sprinkle: see the P1-4
....
Crystaline_Shard: *shrug* never played this game
its okay NewSuperBronyU, i forgive you for being an insensitive jerk of a man :3
but i get your hint
Ah. well P means player.
NewSuperBronyU \:3/
11,02Thank you ;^;
11,02Derpy_Hooves: \;3;/
Spamming thundershock from the burning floor. That's some funny imagery right there
That's kind of you Lyra` :P
ikr, Zuxxez123, a lesser poni would hold a grudge
Petrified_Discord: I never knew Pikachu tastes like Spam. :O
LOL
Indeed.
LAAAAAAAAAAWL
AJIsAwesome: that reminds me of a picture i saw, that i want to unsee so badl, but cant...
AJIsAwesome: Pffft :)
if i play aginst a pikachu and i catch them spamming I ignore everyone else in the match and kill them.
twilight_sprinkle: Oh, my....
o.o
but the spam is funnn
Lawl?
Spam? I DON'T LIKE SPAM!
I'm guessing the person who played as Pikachu is now play as Captain Falcon
or falco?
but Falcon Punch spam is glorious
probs falco
I heard an excellent way to troll in SSBM is to play Kirby in a 4 player match, and just run off to the side away from the action and just spam the taunt all match.
but falco can spam FOREVER
Kandarihu: "HIIIIIIIIIII!"
Battle of the spammers!
11,02The person who played as Pikachu also likes to use Falco o3o
0,14I see people are playing on the best stage ever
HiiiIIIII
0,14also
theres a better way to kirby troll
lol
0,14>Captain Falcon
pikachu can do multiple spams so i liek em :D
suck in a player jump off the stage
oh boy, big blue
Kirbycide?
0,14>not Falcon Punching at all times
take them with you!
This really IS an awesome stage
0,14I'm sad
If you aren't spamming Falcon Paunch, you aren't good Falcon pilot.
oh, so dis is replays
TOON LINK :D
that stage is really fun with bunny hoods and mini
you can race the cars
0,14also, I'm trying to remember if Falcon Punch in Brawl- does something
Crystaline_Shard: It's Brawl's version of Icicle Mountain, hammers only :D
0,14I know Warlock Punch will either insta kill you or opponent
I liked Pokefloats too. Anyone else?
i have a big feeling that that toon link is me .-.
oh yeah! that was cool
I like Ppokefloats
Pokefloats*
warlock punch and falcon punch are high dmg the differince being the direction and vector falcon tends to go more upward but it hits harder
i could never stay on them for long though, was never good at that stage
I had a group of friends that would only play Hyrule Temple. ONLY. Like, all the time. :[
I wouldn't say best stage ever, but I liked it.
temple is teh best though
i mean
um
i liked it
Petrified_Discord: thats a great stage
0,14Temple is okay stage, but Big Blue is da besst
warlock goes up or out one or the other.
it's weaker though
ya this one is me and NewSuperBronyU
AJIsAwesome: You seem quiet, wanna chat about something?
My personal fave was Corneria.
Petrified_Discord: which version?
still like temple teh best being a LOZ fan
superretroworld: There are different ones?
not only playing on final destination
Zuxxez123: Sure. :)
do you even spuer smash bros?
I liked Fountain of Dreams
Petrified_Discord: the n64 one or the gb one?
superretroworld: Oh lol, gb
11,02That last one was me and Derpy ><
NewSuperBronyU: you didnt save the one where we won D:!!!!
So, what kind of games do you enjoy playing the most?
superretroworld: I never got why there were what I assumed to be unfinished buildings floating in space in the 64 version :P
AJIsAwesome: ^
lol
...crackers are a good snack...
11,02Derpy_Hooves: i tried ;3;
0,14fightan gaems
I like the stage but the random effects from the minigames are annoying.
Well, Fountain of Dreams was pretty much just a standard Battlefield layout. But I liked the sound of Kirby music performed by a full-piece orchestra.
see one person get's star
oh the stay still one is great when playing CPU's in this map :D
annoying
Kandarihu: That is why I liked it
SaxyPretender: Streeurt Ferrters
0,14pfft
Lol.
Petrified_Discord: just for show maybe, bthe gb one was to small
0,14more like Persona 4 Arena
Never played Persona? How is it?
0,14I get at that animu swag
Aw snap! I've never played it...
0,14Persona's arguably the best 2D fighter right now
*Persona.
isn;t that theg ame where you get cockblocked and then kill yourself?
It is? Hmm.....seems interesting.
Ezherig: King of the Ring (of something like that) was my first fighter game experience.
Buytoast: :D
0,14really accessible, still has lots of depth
big metal asking or a instant kill
0,14nice and fast, good mechanics
marth was smarth would of grabed and thrown
Mah first fighter was soul calibur. I played 1 and 2 and never learned any combos.
ohh rainbow crusie!
0,14ah, Soul Calibur 2
Cruise*
ha, stage creator
Soul Calibur 2... Those where the days...
0,14first fighting game I fell in love with
SaxyPretender: same.
you didnt make a box MAO!
SaxyPretender: Same.
"A tale of souls and swords, eternally retold..."
My SC2 disc still works.
*map?!>!
I love making stages
best thing to do in multiman melee, get dk, make him smack he ground
^
the*
Gotta show off... :P
I never played any Soul Caliber games. :$
I'd pretty much mostly play as Nightmare and Talim
0,14used to play the crap out of Nightmare
superretroworld: That's the way it works. :P
I was considering 2, but I never go ti.
does this have lavender town music?

I was really hoping in SC5 that all Ezio would have to do is hold right trigger and hit X to counter any move XD

RIP in piece brave Pikmin warriors
At some point i need to go erase my save and golden hammer the crap out of some of the stupid hard ones :/

Zuxxez123: Sorry. It's the awards that you get for completing it is strenous. :$
:3
I only killed what? 3 guys?
I think you need 10?
Maybe 15?
I got to four then the fith got lucky and i rage quit.
0,14also, I never got why Link was the worst character in he game
xD
NewSuperBronyU: you got everything, good job
SaxyPretender: He is? I heard he was the best. :S
yeah
SaxyPretender: he was good in melee
AJIsAwesome: best for weapon master yes.
and i've heard from my friends he's "cheap"
0,14took a look at the SC2 tier list one day
Ah.
0,14was at the total bottom
0,14below the guest characters even
What?
That's strange.
SaxyPretender: Maybe it has something to do with his projectiles?
SaxyPretender: he was a guest charactor too so saying hes below them is not saying much :/
that's because butthurt sony and microsoft fans were upset they didn't get master chief or parappa the rapper
Lol.
NO
11,02D:
The soul edge as a microphone. Parappa is OP
Screw Pararapper anyway, it all about them Crash Bandicoot!
brawl???
Zuxxez123: Agreed.
j
a
11,02D:
NewSuperBronyU: that is a sick joke to play on derpy.
master chief belongs to microsoft SSB belongs to nintendo so that means master chief wont be in the next super smash bros
11,02joke? :<
i heard a rumor the creator of crash bandicot was a brony
I can't even see Parappa having a decent moveset in fighting games.
Cruel brawl :/
microsoft and nintendo are big rivials
flutterchu: Sonic belongs to Sega, but it's in a Nintendo game.
NewSuperBronyU, why you got to build me up buttercup?
just to tear me down?
0,14Parappa's moveset will consist of
Zuxxez123: there's no halo game that's licensed by nintendo
0,14>kicking
0,14>punching
chopping
0,14>thinking it's all the mind
Lyra`: havent heard that song in years
AJIsAwesome, he was a brony? at that time?
:D
Parappa would be super hard to hit with vertical attacks since he's 2D
Invi: I didn't say that. superretroworld did.
Zuxxez123: that's because sonic get's on nintendo alot sega needs it some tendo to play it's games because it's pretty much the only consel that still sells sonic games well
never got past it
They also got Solid snake
demo disk
0,14...hell of a typo
hes not a brony anymore?
hard to imagina parrappa in smash bros universe
Dunno how they managed snake.
AJIsAwesome, oh ok nvm then. it's early in the morning
Lyra`: And mess me round? And the worst of all, he never called when he said he would...
0,14MGS1 had a GCN port
exactly!
flutterchu: Seems like a Mr.G&W skin
0,14and the first two MG games were on NES
we should show him he cant play with girls hearts this way
Lyra`: Yet... You love him still...
everypony ignore him for 5 minutes :3
Well there you go Saxy is a bigger nerd then me!
And yet Lyra` You love him still... :P
Petrified_Discord: hard to imagine him run and walk he never did that in his game
0,14I know Metal gear stuff
Test.
Fluffs|Sleeps: But he can drive a car!
Test complete.
0,14I mean, haven't played the games, but I know stuff
I said bigger nerd!
flutterchu: tab fail :P
11,02D:
in otherword SaxyPretender, wasnt there, but i know what happened
0,14yep
0,14pretty much
http://img.tgdaily.net/sites/default/files/stock/ssbuniverse.jpg
That chat freezing up on meh...
0,14also, dat wonderful feel when Raiden's in Sony All Stars
SSBU?
/me flails
Is anyone going to get the new MG game?
Ess Ess Bee Yuu
0,14which one, AJIsAwesome?
SaxyPretender: Planning on getting Sony All Stars?
0,14nope, don't have a PS3
SaxyPretender: The one focused around Raiden.
i heard that the creators of soul calibur are gonna help nintendo make this game
0,14also, yes, I'll be getting that one, AJIsAwesome
0,14also also, not quite, flutterchu
0,14the only Soul Calibur staff guy on the new Smash is the sound director
I'm considering getting it. Combat seems interesting.
They give SSBU weaponmaster like :/
it will be for nintendo WII U and nintendo 3DS
Just the sound director.. Wow...
0,14hey, in my book, that's awesome
But they do have the main team from Tekken
0,14Soul Calibur's got an amazing soundtrack
0,14and yeah, think most of the advisers are from Tekken
Never really a fan of Tekken, but it has retained it's individuality over the years
I cryed myself to sleep after perfecting weaponmaster.
Not saying it's bad, I love SC's music, but going from a team, just a music director.
0,14true, would be nice if they got Junichi Nakatsuru and the rest of them
night everypony
Night superretroworld
I miss Melee's taunt kills.
Night superretroworld
0,14later superretroworld
Now I'm just imagining Soul Calibur with nintendo characters :D
bye superretroworld
GN retro.
nighty superretroworld
tekkenn on psp was tons of fun
Night superretroworld
and was pretty balanced
11,02:<
who can Petrified_Discord
nuuuu
I never liked Tekken, seemed to rely on you knowing the combos and being able to air juggle.
:O
That ping.
Zuxxez123: at the pro levels yeah, thats whats required to win
keep thinking ponies are talking to me.
i mean vs pro players
twilight_sprinkle: Right. I think I played Tekken 2, didn't really get into personally.
MLGGGGGGGGGGGG
0,14yeah, when it comes to Tekken, you have to know your matchups really well
noiii
teh feed
It'll be back, I'm sure.
/me boops SB's nose
:3
I hate memorising combo's
11,02Dat mah nose /)u(\
:3
Crystaline_Shard: Same. Lol, I just wanna mash buttons and win. Lol.
Crystaline_Shard: You gotta do your homework before you play a fighter XD
0,14^
Yes. :D
Some PC related. :D
DAT TOFU BOY :D
xD
I don't button spam i just mostly push a driection and a attack button see what hapepns
bye guys
I'm off to bed. Night everypony
i actually managed to get up to 40 in the world without bothering to memorizez anything in tekken on the psp. of course it wasnt pvp, it was different challenges
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjuQYEgL8XQ im DAVID
Night, Derpy_Hooves :)
I found a good combo with link that way in SC2
*memorize
bye Derpy_Hooves
Can't wait for my first Movie Night here. :3 Not to mention it will be one of my favorite movies. :D
I remember a lot of Kilik's moves were just "hit button _ repeatedly". He was REALLY fun to buttonmash with :D
but then some stupid glitch happened and i couldnt register for world tourneys anymore until i beat my own high scores, which was way too hard seeing how i already made it to 40 in the world..
Called it air walk'n :/ it involved knocking the enemy into the air and then jumping on them with the down stab done right you get all three stabs in
Petrified_Discord: Totally, the range he had, along with the speed he seemed to have... Made button mashing fun. xD
:/ button mashers
0,14I don't totally look down on button mashing
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Ponies in the News - The Guardian and The Mary Sue
Now now; I don't always button mash. Just when messing around with people.
0,14helps new people get a feel for the game
"Mary Sue"?
i remember beating tekken 3 in an amuzement park just by spamming jins twiple roundhouse kick
I play MK9 online, and I use combos often. :3
0,14heck, i started out mashing a lot >.>
1) Press buttons 2) ??? 3) Victory
I know I can tolerate it but at least give me a challange.
everyone starts out mashing
how do i chat on my ipad?
flutterchu: use iris
0,14alternatively, you can roll face on arcade stick and win!
twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, that's how you get a feel for the game, just like SaxyPretender said.
twilight_sprinkle: is that some app
DAT SMB
flutterchu: its an option bottom-right of the chat
I kinda want to find my old SC2 and actually learn Kilik's combos now :)
NewSuperBronyU: did you 100% this game?
also i played the demo for a naruto fighting game on psp, and it was a lot of fun
Lol. That's the problem talking about SC2, you just get the need to go back. :D
twilight_sprinkle: Naruto fighting games are pure button mashers. Lol.
11,02Crystaline_Shard: I haven't beaten it yet, no :(
Zuxxez123: that game was faaaar from it...

AdamTheDuck: That was my nightmare as a kid.
uses hypnosis on twilight_sprinkle
It was all our nightmares XD
it's a shame poison doesn't do that anymore
Now they fixed it to either the poison fades away over time or it stops at 1 HP.
My nightmare as a kid was drounding, then having the Sonic song that played when you needed air when underwater... That damn song brought so much anxiety...
I like the new change, that way you don't black out on the field.
Ah that's good to know :D Too bad I stopped playing pokemon at black and white
I don't pison death only happened if you were stupid.
/me uses a dark-type move on flutterchu|ghost
twilight_sprinkle: youre not even a pokemon
Zuxxez123: It actually didn't scare me that much. In fact, it was a rush of adrenaline.
"I like having my games dumbed down. Playing with a challenge is too much for me to handle."
flutterchu|ghost: doesnt mean i cant do dark type moves
twilight_sprinkle: why dark type.....are you emo?
I got the rush too, when playing the game. But in my dreams.. It's haunted me. xD AJIsAwesome
