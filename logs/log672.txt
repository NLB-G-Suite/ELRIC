Suddenly saw Sinatra singing about Ponies...

these singers....
OH YEAH!
i just realized that its OCTOBER!!!!
halloween bitchez
oh mai
oh yes
October <3
Halloween, another reason for women to dress up scantly. :P

Rain, not moon
planet
and not much atmosphere
why must my name always get cut off by 1 letter!?
you'll get to see how violent landing without an atmosphere is
without much i meen
need to make it over that mound
cool
Ooh a birthday!
/me gives One
fail
lol missing a letter
pbpbpbppbbbpbpbpppb well i need to sleep. nighty everypony
come on
they have a cockpit cam
deploy
deploy parachutes
THANK YOU
i could sleep to this :D
lol no sleep
nice even surface to land on :3
Hi
People
i cant actually get out
How are these eyes called
theres no ladders
Strabismus gives you these eyes
you monster
Opps
And Derpy has them
Hu
xD
well i'm not sure
i'ma quicksave and try
^_^
JUST powerfull enough
Bunny~
oh
Thank you friend.
we're going home
night guys
ded
Rain, a long time
lol
using a cheat sheet? :3c
lol
and then we waited
Rain, its easier than doing all the mat
math'
:P
i went through how to do the math but its boring to do by hand
is purple home?
blue is home
purple is eve
....
I sense a certain.... Weirdness upcoming...
oh
:3
waiting
waiting
waiting some more
Rain, jupiter
can you land on it or is it actually gas?
...
Where have I heard this song before?
:P
stupid moon
this stupid moon
*celestial
i'm going to have to go for the next orbit
Rain, porbably
quicksave cheating
XD
dude with that orbit
he has no where near enough delta-v to hit the sun
eventually you /have/ to hit kerbin
joking
damn k key not liking to be pressed
I am not Candaian, I can't partake in this joke. :P
Good night all.
XD
Rain, its hard to hit the sun
no kirbin
if you just time warp
oh
Rain, that takes a LONG time
found an intercept
there we go
actually its just the one
but still
kerbonaught
:p
seems it is uncertian about it
epic timing on that music
might want to slow down now
oh, well shit.
iva landing?
its fine
i'll land
how?
Ooh Kerbin landing
ans you have 0 thrust... >_>
how are you in the atmosphere....?
.........
Rain, it says that, but that view doesnt take atmosphere into account
atmosphere starts at 80KM up
oh...
about 24KM is enough to bleed off anything under ~5KM/s
that must have changed then
it never took it into account :P
I remember the atmosphere being much lower in the version I have
i'ma brb
give us a view outside before you go
through the window
NO. Go away! Everything was just fine before you showed up! Go drink some coffee! With cream, or something! SHEEESH
XD
Rain, i'll walk home over the ocean
Hello everypony!! :)
should be there in no time
yup
swim them buns into steel
those kerbin are kings
you just ruined their rover
and getting back from that is near impossible
been to joot then? :3c
i've been to jool
not much to do there
i do want to land on one of its moons but getting back from that is even harder
Rain, bugs
and eve is hard to get back from because it is like trying to do a second launch off of kerbin, right?
oh wow
its escape velocity is 1KM/s higher
Rain, i have to build a ship that can launch of kerbin and land that on eve
with the supplies that you spend decades gathering
on eve
yeah, its like doing a return trip from mars
except harder
because you need bigger ships
they need to impliment colonising
after generations :3
i need ideas
my ships are insufficent
look up one that was sucessful?
Rain, i checked the fourm a few weeks after 0.17 was released, no one had managed it yet
/me wakes up
*yawn*
oh wow
http://imgur.com/a/zdyVu#2 interplanetary capable
i am impress
http://imgur.com/a/qJSCQ#0
hmmmm
1 man or 3 man?
a return trip from the sun would be epic
xD
Rain, cant, they've implimented heat physics
3 man is heavier
Allo everyone.
Rain, nothing really
well if i loose a man
lose.
which is likely during eva
awww
Rain, well yeah, but if i eva and one of them hits the ground too hard theres two to spare
Kerbals need a Scorpion skin now.
ladder >_>
*thinking
Now we just need to draw the lottery results from all the lurkers Rain.
Pokykdgdhd
ok
I like how I have been here for near a year and only won once
and that once that I won, someone messed with my pick :3
i need to get this
to the ground
that last bit has to happen with all the fuel left in this stage
that gives me enough to return to kerbin from prety much anywhere
:D just kidding
As for the purple ground, you'd need the early lifeforms of the planet to be retinal based instead of chlorophyll, in theory that'd lead to a purple planet.
Not sure what's creepier, my licks or that meme XD
Rain, this thing wont work in the atmosphere :P
the licks
-Courtesy of the purple earth hypothesis.
if the atmosphere is thicker that is
Rain, i can use jets on kerbin and the jool moon, cant on eve
my bf might get mad at you if you were actually trying to flirt with me x3
There's no escaping my licks ._.
oh shit that spider
^
Mm?
you should kinda stop doing that
Are you trying to encourage or discourage me.
discourage
Because you're accomplishing the former.
I dont exactly want you banned.
^
I do live in Australia :P
How are we all tonight?
She's really got to suck it up.
Yeah I did.
I am now
the (admittedly overly strict) rules are
/me thinks getting tackled it fun
hi buddy!
Because there's nothing in the rules that say I should.
the rules do say if a mod asks you to stop doing something then you should stop
Bbl, gonna play some KF :P
forget the rules, people want you to stop
http://i.imgur.com/uwO2j.jpg fuck the po-lice~
Can I keep the pictures of sealife?
i like those
she kinda found that insulting when you did that
Did she find it kinda insulting when I called her pretentious?
don't know why, they weren't scary or shocking
autopilot is credit to team
they have good cars, they can have good guns
huh
the govt. hates the austrailian people
very muddy
cope with the circumstances
?
ok
I don't
11,02:<
Look Rain I appreciate the thought but honestly I don't like being unable to share things I like because some people are scared of bugs.
6_9
dammit I just wasted an hour on reddit
Maybe, are they a tool?
ok
this stage is sufficent
i need to land this on eve
Still Rain, since you asked and I don't find you entirely annoying, I'll purge my image base. No bugs.
you know if you like gave a warning about it or something
hmmmmmm
/me where did I go wrong
i cant attach rockets to this
says*
Noted for future pictures of fish.
fish are 2spooky4me
/me sighs
whats is this song?

Blasphemy, all hail the best pony.
whats the song called???
ok

thanks dude
Night moo-and gone

I need a biscuit or something. Brb.
we didnt need those engines anyway
and then down
for the strangest reason though, changlings remind me of tyranids, a lot.
okay, I guess that works
Too bad it's full of people.
now
if it can make it into orbit
then its ready for a flight to eve
changelings are kinds cool tho, think of the possibilities if you had one as a friend
eyupo

ugh... going to have to get used to a first shift schedule again. mornin' folks
why not? it can never hurt to use them x3
Rain, does kill the fps a bit
>_< I'm not sure whether I want that FONV mod in the roundup based on that preview image

pfft I ain't no school kid

Ill be back on later tonight
HMMM

Okies
thats suposed to say gunbuster, not gunbuser
gunbuser? the firearms have to go to school too?
its a work in progress
BOOOOOOOM
Ok, going to cook some lunch, bbl
it bugs it out a bit
the cool thing is the 'booster'
plus it exists as a single 'unit' that can be attched via a decoupler
many bugs were exploited during the production of this craft
anyone still here?
:(
lol yea
yep
ksp hates me for building this thing
plus i had to construct the booster in the vab
bugs out when you import it into the sph
tf2 time
hallo everypony o.o
o.o
I think those random allerts are when people accept those wedding rings from others
Rain, yeah but this one said 'mlp is shit'
o.o
/me shrugs
oppinions
oh nvm, canadian
Rain, i dont care tbh, just want to know why he bothered to spend all that money to express his opinion to everyone on tf2
apparently thought it was worth it
or has a lot of cash
or both
or was drunk and had a lot of cash
drunk people can work paypal
?
some can
i cant get it to work sober
lol
maybe it makes more sense when drunk

You done goofed.
but yeah i have a lander that MIGHG be able to land on eve
and make it back
dayum
its dificult because eve is denser than kerbin and has one heck of an atmosphere
i MIGHT be able to land with extra fuel
but failing that its capable of lifting off from kerbin with the planned lander stage
wish i could turn rockets off
dont have it
busy
GOOMBA'D

its my birthday
:O
But seriously, thanks.

Usually the default one.
I GOT DA KRITZ
Of course, any of them are good if you can use them properly.
TF2*
All dat crate.
Meh, i have a strange quick-fix, i have no clue where i got it from. Just wondering if I could sell it.
You can probably find someone who'll trade for that.
Yeah :P
and by bad graphics card i mean the card is ded
Ill take a look around
I just use outpost, lol.
hello
'Lo.

How long have you been playing tf2? :o

I'm still a F2P
Oh
But still, i dont have any hats to trade atm.
but thats for my Gentlespy set
THEN ill have hats to spare
I have like 5 of those...
Salvaged?
:P
I have all of the 40's
Salvaged # 40 goes for 12keys atm
and i think 1 #30
People expect it to get to 16+
>12 keys
>crate
lolno
I'm not paying 12 keys for a crate
Its a Salvaged crate (super-rare)
The some stranges are worth more than the crate itself :P
*Then some
I might pay that much for a HAT, but considering the gamble you take when opening crates, it isn't worth it...
Meh
one sec
If I sell my crate for 16 keys, ill have enough to get everything I want in tf2 :3

08,01so apparently, Gangnam Style is #1 in the UK charts
08,01which is just... mind blowing
08,01considerign how xenophobic the UK is
its a damn good song though, Saturn
Saturn: also, it's all in korean!
OMG its Saturn!

08,01i'm putting together a piano cover of Gangnam Style
/me cheers for Saturn
/me rolls out the blue carpet
/me 08,01rolls about
For some reason Italy never had much of a problem with mildly violent manga like 4kids
Oh yeah, GANGNAM STYLE seems to be the bomb
OPPA GANG
-nam style
damn you tiny computer!
The really violent anime though is aired only on cable or regional channels, and that's why to this day the Fist of the North Star sucks balls :D
never watched Fist Of The North Star, mainly because it was never shown in my country
08,01who is streaming?
There's a stream?
05i was plannign to saturn but go ahead

Which means... HALLOWEEN :3
Its cancer awareness month!
/me 08,01hides
Saturn: NOSTALGIAWEEN!
^
I just saw a semi drive by my place with the company name "AJ Transport LLC"
Saturn: but you still accept friends and gifts, right?
CHRISTMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!
/me is the most wonderful time, of the year........*
08,01and i don't give them to everyone i know
08,01if i find somethign that fits someone, they get a gift
08,01if not, i don't
08,01*if not, they don't
08,01and i don't go out looking for gifts; it's more that if i come across something suitable, i'll use it
Hello everypony...I had nightmares the other day.
05ok bootin' up
08,01i could go on
I just like the presents :p
08,01this stems from when i was engaged
08,01my parents would want me to spend it with them
08,01and, of course, i couldn't spend it with both of them, because they *hated* each other
08,01realy hated each other
I meant that creepy looking pony with that creepy face!
Streamception!
08,01my favourite time of year is Beltane
Bonfires in may? cool!
The best part about that pic in the lower left? I play all six of those snipers
08,01i celebrate my brthday
My favorite holiday? F*ck it, I loved ALL of them!
/me votes for Halloween as best holiday
^
I like halloween.
Even the lesser known ones! I. Loved. Them. ALL.
Saturn you already made a freaking good convention ;)
NOSTALGIAWEEN!
Or rather, I used to. Nowadays interest in it seems to be declining over here.
Shit gotta go
later
I really really hate Halloween
laters, everypony. Edumacation time.
08,01VenHur: i've had a few cavities in my time
08,01the amount of sugar i eat, i don't think anyone's really surprised
08,01you know that sick feeling you get when you eat too much sugar?
08,01i don't get that
You're dentist don't mind either.
Your*
inb4 my own Textwall
Saturn: Well, when you get too much sugar, you'll be a Pinkie Pie.
/me preps for textwall
At least that what's I known.
08,01diabetes runs in my family
08,01so i know that at some point i'm going to be diabetic
ok, i'll be off for a while, re-watching Yu Gi Oh the pyramid of light first-hoof
Wrekception
08,01so i'm enjoying sugar while i can
Saturn: :O
Saturn: same here, but i'm on a diet
i'll still be here, but i'll see the movie on full-screen
I might do some pros and cons sometimes, for the lols.
08,01i don't actually celebrate Haloween
They called that "holiday" Halloween.
08,01because it's the same day as (and actually based on) the festival of Sammhuin
08,01*Samhuinn
How can you not want to celebrate a holiday that revolves around making people wet themselves?
08,01and costumes
08,01and holds emotional significance for me
Fair enough.
08,01also, body paint
08,01http://beltane.org/about/samhuinn/
more pylons
YOU NEED TO CONSTRUCT MORE PYLONS
08,01MadSurge: it's fucking awesome
08,01there's also drums
08,01lots
08,01of drums
I like lots of Drums :) I would like to see (and hear) that
08,01MadSurge: awesome!
08,01MadSurge: you're in the UK, aren't you?
Saturn: no you silly, Italy! :D
Oh, I like drums too...
08,01maybe
...But, they're not my favorite intrument.
Fried fish is the shit, Saturn :$
Heya guys :)
Hello Brovakiin.

08,01i'd be a great daddy
This stream is becoming Burger Hill :D
>have kids

Saturn: No doubt about it :D
08,01if i'm still in a gay relationship when i have kids, i'm not sure the route i'd want to take to have kids
dabi pls
08,01i'd probably impregnate a close friend or somethin
Saturn: :D
Saturn Oh my
Hey everypony
Acually is dabi.

I be lurking
Why do i get hi'd when i have been here since around 2 PM my time and it's 5 PM
Even if it's slightly illegal?
Saturn if everyone is ok with that than I see no Problem :)
08,01Meanwhile: if he didn't want kids, i wouldn't be with him
Also
Would maek the sitation easier, no?
Right
I'm off on WoW
Or blue, whichever.
Because 90% of political parties are nobb'eds
Donate blood to him if you're the same type :P
And that would appear to be the end of that.

I really wanna play an Old RTS now -.-
but with out reson only
I though more along the lines of Age of Empires, Empire Earth, Cossacks, American Conquest :)
or something more build up like the Settlers or ANNO
i know
It's the type of thing you have in games that focus on civilisation without specifying conflict.
i know
to needy
maybe some ANNO 1602 or 1503 :) or if you like really tidius work, play the Partrician 3 XD
powned
ok
has he seen the army of yellow
I'd call the Partrician 3 after 10 years still the best, most Complex and well thought out Trading and building Simulation to date

anyone laik the song i linked? :D
:o
kinda felt the song was a bit weak
eh, to each their own
well it
ups
listening, starts weak, develops unoriginally, and the drop isn´t anything special. Call it a 3-4/10
I dont like the drop... I like techno/trance. Where the rhythm is nice and steady/repetitive
we are all different you know
and that piece is competently built, but nothing special

cause then it feels like it is over in 3 seconds
instead of 3 hours of being drilled and cut open
wut
<.<
Oh blood magpies
Yeah, they are leaving it open for me, if I want to get sedated or not.
why you such a bad chapter?
and in 30 seconds or less you're out like a light
and then in 2 seconds you wake up and 3 hours passed
Good evening.
18
Got all four to get removed.
yea
get sedated beyond all belief
xD
you dont want to remember surgery
my brotehr actually woke up during it
Now I'm really thinking about it, I don't want to remember any of this. xD Sedation it is!
he woke up during surgery, they stopped, and gave him more anesthesia
It's pretty cool how it's all over in mere seconds.

Suddenly there's an ASSLOAD of war going on.
Yeah. Legit. According to some neuro-somthing-ologist, I had a bad reaction to the drug that put me out for longer than intended
Talking about mouth surgery and sedatement, all while a helluva war is going on. I like it.
In-game war.
Oh, okay. Lol.

STOP SAYING THAT
dat phrase
That would require that a Jedi's power being able to manipulate binary switches in a microprocessor.
Which they can't. >_>
why hello there twilight amadala
Er no, they would have to be able to physically adjust the switches. :P
i think it's more a matter of resolution than strength
because people are fickle
Damaging the processors wouldn't mentally manipulate the droids.
....
bait
Star wars is pretty much about lasers now.
also, they would have to be able to fluidly think in binary to be able to actually do anything effective to the droid
13Caramel: silly val say it right

But then, everything in this series runs on Rule of Cool.

why doesn't grievous ever use the force?
anakin
2,14 Grievous isn't a jedi
pimp sleeves
2,14 he has no control over the force
i think grievous has some feel for the force though
but he can swing a light saber
yeah
2,14 and as you'll see soon (spoiler warning) his lack of force powers is his undoing
Well....
he ahs a living brain
Thought it was a cyborg.
2,14 whatevs
Technically he's a cyborg, yeah
hm, i think i read somewhere taht he did have a slight onnection to the force
Which is why he dies the way he does in Ep 3
2,14 point is, he can't do jedi shit
He's more machine now, than man.
-lol

How is he able to anticipate the Jedi movements without connection to the force?

Battle of the spammers!
0,14I see people are playing on the best stage ever
HiiiIIIII
0,14also
lol
0,14>Captain Falcon
Kirbycide?
0,14>not Falcon Punching at all times
take them with you!
This really IS an awesome stage
0,14I'm sad
If you aren't spamming Falcon Paunch, you aren't good Falcon pilot.
TOON LINK :D
you can race the cars
0,14also, I'm trying to remember if Falcon Punch in Brawl- does something
I liked Pokefloats too. Anyone else?
oh yeah! that was cool
I like Ppokefloats
Pokefloats*
warlock punch and falcon punch are high dmg the differince being the direction and vector falcon tends to go more upward but it hits harder
i could never stay on them for long though, was never good at that stage
I wouldn't say best stage ever, but I liked it.
i mean
um
i liked it
warlock goes up or out one or the other.
it's weaker though
My personal fave was Corneria.
I liked Fountain of Dreams
11,02That last one was me and Derpy ><
lol
...crackers are a good snack...
11,02Derpy_Hooves: i tried ;3;
0,14fightan gaems
I like the stage but the random effects from the minigames are annoying.
Well, Fountain of Dreams was pretty much just a standard Battlefield layout. But I liked the sound of Kirby music performed by a full-piece orchestra.
see one person get's star
oh the stay still one is great when playing CPU's in this map :D
annoying
0,14pfft
Lol.
0,14more like Persona 4 Arena
Never played Persona? How is it?
Aw snap! I've never played it...
0,14Persona's arguably the best 2D fighter right now
*Persona.
isn;t that theg ame where you get cockblocked and then kill yourself?
It is? Hmm.....seems interesting.
0,14really accessible, still has lots of depth

0,14Soul Calibur's got an amazing soundtrack
0,14and yeah, think most of the advisers are from Tekken
I cryed myself to sleep after perfecting weaponmaster.
0,14true, would be nice if they got Junichi Nakatsuru and the rest of them
night everypony
tekkenn on psp was tons of fun
and was pretty balanced
11,02:<
nuuuu
I never liked Tekken, seemed to rely on you knowing the combos and being able to air juggle.
:O
That ping.
keep thinking ponies are talking to me.
MLGGGGGGGGGGGG
noiii
It'll be back, I'm sure.
/me boops SB's nose
:3
I hate memorising combo's
:3
0,14^
Yes. :D
DAT TOFU BOY :D
xD
bye guys
i actually managed to get up to 40 in the world without bothering to memorizez anything in tekken on the psp. of course it wasnt pvp, it was different challenges
I found a good combo with link that way in SC2
*memorize
I remember a lot of Kilik's moves were just "hit button _ repeatedly". He was REALLY fun to buttonmash with :D
Called it air walk'n :/ it involved knocking the enemy into the air and then jumping on them with the down stab done right you get all three stabs in
:/ button mashers
0,14I don't totally look down on button mashing
Now now; I don't always button mash. Just when messing around with people.
"Mary Sue"?
i remember beating tekken 3 in an amuzement park just by spamming jins twiple roundhouse kick
I play MK9 online, and I use combos often. :3
1) Press buttons 2) ??? 3) Victory
I know I can tolerate it but at least give me a challange.
everyone starts out mashing
0,14alternatively, you can roll face on arcade stick and win!
DAT SMB
I kinda want to find my old SC2 and actually learn Kilik's combos now :)
Lol. That's the problem talking about SC2, you just get the need to go back. :D
