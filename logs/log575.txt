11,01Forcing you to buy a code to access the MP if you buy used should be illegal.

Nittany_Discord, its because they are following in stride with EA :\
11,01My opinion, and it will never change.
I HATE JOHNNY TEST
GigabitHarmonie: Sym Bionic Titan

BOTH : How much did you spend on the steam sale

http://i42.tinypic.com/ev9wl5.jpg
Goddammit why won't it die?
hmm, i was jusat joking with that question but ehh
:D
The first MW was good

Did anyone think of Metal Gear solid on the future twilight episode?
otakon: Ikr
it is dead, but it's soulless husk is still trudging on
BattleField Or Call Of Duty?
sorry Quick_Thinker i stole your thunder
then they fucked it up
MaxTheBrony: the second was okay
Firelight: Call of Battlefield.
YES!
otakon: it was amusing to play with friends
YES IT IS!
MW is best CoD
Alpha-Omega: actually, that was more or less taken from another show to my knowledge. dont remember the shows name, but the title of the ep was oroborous
the problem with the call of duty stuff is that there's pretty much no more wars for them to use
ALLEGRO: are you going to buy halo 4?
so now they're just recycling everything
Terraria or Minecraft?
I bought MW1 in
GigabitHarmonie: If you could make 5 of the Mane6 into Real Life characters that would be with you for life, and no Goverment would buck you over, which 5 of the 6 would you choose? ;)
Alpha-Omega: sorry, i meant ouroboros
yea, neighborhood kid play socom on PS2 wit hother people online
'09, and i havn't bought a CoD since :D
im buying BO2 becuase well it actually for the first time looks like they realize it is near its end and are trying to mix it up
YES MY QUESTION WAS ANSWERED AGAIN
D
:D
I got gifted MW3
SWAG
I need a tl break, brb.
Sylandest, :D
What is the name of the youtube channel this is going to?
Vordox: do they retain their normal pony abilities? such as flight or magic?
11,01TBH, I would rent CoD before buying.
i have spent nothing becuase im broke
Have either of you ever been attacked by a horny badger?
ingwaz: Yes

Nittany_Discord, >.> dont even do that... borrow it from a friend XD
Nittany_Discord: But you got the pre-order for BO2 gifted to you :D
Buytoast: yes
Vordox: most likely leave behind fluttershy then
ALLEGRO: are you going to buy halo 4?
IS THis Q&A Helping You Play The Game?

Azuredragon: no idea

GigabitHarmonie & Alegro: If you could make 5 of the Mane6 into Real Life characters ponies that would be with you for life, and no Goverment would buck you over, which 5 of the 6 would you choose? ;)
GO BACK
Vordox: pinkie, twi, rarity and rd are all pretty much automatic choices. choosing between aj and fluttershy is hard
XD
lali-ho HatchetRyda , some guys streaming amnesia and answering quesions

GIGA: do you ever had a cherrychanga?

Here's a question for you two, have you bought The Binding of Isaac yet?
nite otakon
/me waves goodnight to chat.
ingwaz: Give it a real thought... Would RD feel good without Fluttershy? ;)
also GigabitHarmonie you have had time to think so which one of the Mane 6 would you kill if you were forced to choose
got a question: Pokemon or Digimon?
00,10piracy, the best try before you buy pprogram
and they're dead
QUESTION
11,01Lol Sumica.
shit
11,01Also best way to play a game when DRM or publisher bullshit stops you.
QUESTION: why is this so amusing?
Vordox: you're asking me to split up 6 best friends by leaving one of them behind. no matter the choice, they'll all feel bad about that
whats in the box>
ingwaz: . :)
Vordox: simple solution, have twilight work her magic and transport fluttershy over
Is a muffin an instrument?
Night Everone
Id just like to know because its 1:00 here
Sumica, haha thats what I do
Vordox: or, better yet, i trade in the 5 transports of them for the 1 transport of me to equestria
the door had to much fudge
YES!
Pokemon is after you for Liking MLP
8,6lol
:O
Screw AJ!
Vordox: i like that idea better
11,01I have to agree.
HEY
QUESTION: *Slowly Eats Apple* Oh... Sorry. What? OH! Question... Yeah I don't have a question for now.
booooo
IDE SAY DROP RARITY
Rarity is the one that should be left behind.
i love applejack for the accent
I would leave Rarity :/
Sumica, BURNED :D
kindof
11,01I'd even keep Rarity.
I love country girls
AJ >>>>>>>>>> RD
:D
and Fluttershy
combined
fluttershy is boring
i mean, how often is it that you see a cartoon pony with a texan accent?
AJ Will Be of Great Use Here Where I am living
She's pretty much a gold digging bitch potato.
nobody loves characters with southern accents :(
Drop Rarity
derpy_pony: all the this
i would say RD
sagas /)
My choice: I would not take any of the 5, I don't want them to experience our world. :)
What is the name of the youtube channel this is going to?
why would you drop rarity? Rarity= FREE CLOTHES!
also GigabitHarmonie you have had time to think so which one of the Mane 6 would you kill if you were forced to choose
\\\///
(\ Staticcloud
TheHoodyNinja: glad i wasnt the only one thinking that
Night guys, Thx Giga And Alegro for the birthday wishes peace
I need a tl break, brb.

GigabitHarmonie: Rarity
sheeeyet
00,10game on steam says code already used cant play but some how works fine with ubi's steam knockoff
bye ThrackerzodR
sagas: not true. if she were shallow, she would have had little problem with blueblood. instead, she hated him because apart from being handsome and royalty, he was an absolute douche
Sumica: they did with far cry 2
:3
Spike is a mane character too idk why nobody acknowlegdes that
no prob :P
happy birhfay ThrackerzodR !
8,6you don't need to, it's ok :P

twilight smells funny
I hate this keyboard
WUT?!
TheHoodyNinja: because hes a non-pony mane character
D:

11,01Ubi started my cynicism for me. I really hope they can their stupid DRM forever and have learned from trying to use such draconian DRM.
NO!
:O

The cogs just made me think of Conker's Bad Fur Day.

OH HELL NO! YOU ARE SOOOOOOOO DEAD!!!!
/me hates you forever

Pinkie in a good ep is always good
ingwaz: are you a guy?
Firelight: i agree!
/me sniffs twilight sparkle

:O
Have you sniffed yourself after a study cram session
derpy_pony: that was bad and you should feel bad

Raritys ugly lol
TheHoodyNinja: hmm... let me check here

Oh noes
TheHoodyNinja: yes...i do seem to posess the necessary requirements
GigabitHarmonie WANTS TO KILL PINKIE PIE!!!!!
Spike Was RD In one episode LETS KILL hIM
I am the great and mighty poo~
If you were the MLD guy, would you have kept RD or let her go?
Pinkie breaks 4th wall, I'm sure she can break death too
now why would i kill pinkie pie i did not say she would die
xD haha
GigabitHarmonie is a pony butcher
Aleg how do you feel about alot of the games that are coming out that have gone back to being hard insted of being very easy IE: Dark Souls
GigabitHarmonie: then you shoulda said Rarity
i just said it would influence it
Should have Said SPIKE!!!
I would'nt been plaesed with rarity
GigabitHarmonie: What is your thought that even Spike and Chrysalis/Cadance had a song for themselves before Applejack? ;)
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID SPIKE!
GigabitHarmonie: you forgot Rainbow Dash
sagas, rarity is my fav :(
Twilight is best pony according to to bronystate poll :<
GigabitHarmonie everything you say can and will probably be used againt you in this chat
ANSWER : Terraria or Minecraft?
Firelight: spike is my fav character...
00,10hey GigabitHarmonie, sing The Pirates of Penzance
8,6chill, it was a stupid question, move past it
also GigabitHarmonie you could have just killed yourself and that way no pony dies
pretty sure if you said rainboww dash, they would boo you
Panda: cant take to whiny aspect of her
I love them all so I would dislike it if you even think of death to any if them
D: Giga killed pinkie D:
anyways, amnesia
sagas, i know :D
he wants pinkie ded
I heard it
Is derpy hooves best rain cloud?
Moving past the question now!
what if the mane 6 fusion together?
Don't kill Pinkie. Just her parents, so she can learn music at the orphanage.
YES HE IS!! HE IS A PONY!
"Here lied Giga, he always wanted Pinkie dead"
:D
spike is the new rainbow dash
O.o
GigabitHarmonie: she'll kill you first and bake you into cupcakes
Hi GigabitHarmonie :3
What is the name of the youtube channel this is going to?

HE IS A PONY IN A DRAGON OUTFIT and Everyone knows it.
ALLEGRO: whats your favorite meme?
MINECRAFT!
GigabitHarmonie: Aka Pirate3 :p

Teraria is a copy of Minecraft
Gigabit was your voice actually higher pitched when you were younger?
Well Minecraft is bigger, but Terraria have more stuff...
terraria has nothing to do to minecraft
#D > 2D
except that it's a survival
3D
They even have BUNNIES!
terraria is more adventurous
Terraria looks like it copied existing sprites from tother games
MineCraft has fucking Cows... FUCKING COWS
but Minecraft caught up
Aleg how do you feel about alot of the games that are coming out that have gone back to being hard insted of being very easy IE: Dark Souls
XD
xD
haha

Firelight about as exciting making a letsplay out of it
GigabitHarmonie too be honest i made you choose who to kill and you choose you have no right to be hated i did come up with the question so i deserve all the hate
Ingwaz How bout YES?
FPS, RPG, 3rd peson shooter, strategy, racing, horror etc. What do you prefer?
She does a good job anyway
QUESTION: If My Little pony Had a Main Character Swap (For Example Instead of twilight as the one pony who "Stands out the most") Witch other Mane 6 pony would it be?
Funfact: Applejack's voice is based on Dolly Parton and Miley Cyrus
Hey Ocean ftw
Firelight: applejack. She seemed to do a lot more than derpy did
thats why you get a different person that sounds the same like aplebloom
BOTH OF YOU: will you guys make a bronystate facbook page? :D
CapTaIn_MasterBoss43: i refuse. i shall continue conversing with these fine fellows of mine as i see fit. unless of course i decide to retire to my bed chambers for some respite
Just stop saying stuff to me, Ingwaz.

Tic Tac Toe to... what's it called, Dream is Collapsing from Inception?
13because you think it is coincidence that i was not in my chair for a moment und then there is a tack on your seat
Howard Stern hates a lot of things honestly

Spice up the games
Nintendo
game play
ruling is more fun than saving trufact
he does have very good and valid points though
SNK all the way, babe!
Sega is almost done for all they make are games now...no consoles.
00,10Sound can cary a game more then video can
all of them are needed to make a game fun
its like having a horrible voice actor with a good animation
What do you think is the worst TV show currently on TV?

Visual = Style, Graphical = Detaljs
GigabitHarmonie: aduio inhanis the pic and pic inhanis the aduio
RAWRity, iCarly
style? i know that i HATE cell shading
i may now choose style
Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie both you guys said something about Mega Man earlier, so apply Vordox's question to that. What about that game in the context of his question fits it? Megaman for me is so memorable becuase of the music/audio
what do you think about the rising trend of cellshading?
Megaman has kickass music
Perhaps some of the Mega Man music is TOO memorable? :$
MASF123: hell ya
Cellshading looks beatiful
style is very important

Phase4 can you die by going into the thruster blast
at which height do jet engines stop being useful?
Oooh, THIS again.
you might not need them ^^
fun fact: 95% of all emergency landings in water fail horribly
Where has he been to this time?
Luna?

Link?
In Pm.
Phase4: Good job!

00,02derpy_pony, they drop in efficency the higher you get, cutout is like 15KM
Phase: can you switch crafts with the kerbal? Ie take a ship to the mun, and then get in a ship that was already there?
hehe http://derpy.me/jLZ7a
00,02lets try this
Hey Phase4. Play some music
It keeps the fluids up

That video is so much win.
Nigga, we going to space
would have worked with less than half the fuel
00,02Memme, thanks, i nicked it from youtub... i meen i came up with it :P
xMLPxREACTORx: Then don't listen to anything, just read it alone.
00,02DAMNIT
00,02ran out of fuel
Phase4: ...Right.
Liek if you cri erytiem
LOL
I MEAN, NO!
00,02Memme, the youtube one used a mod, i wanted to try with stock parts
one more solid booster on the core vehicle
wish me luck:)
Phase4: There's mods for this game? Wow.
00,02Memme, a LOT of mods
Anyone who play tribes ascend here?
Phase4 . press F13. It enables th
Phase4: Content packs?
TEH BEST NIGHT EVAR
WE'LL GET FUCKED
The best trip EVER!
SNORT COKE
00,02Memme, not sure what you meen
At the gala!
I feel like we should fly a kerbal over kerbin, and see if it splats when it hits
At the gala!
Phase4: What kind of mods?
Apple-testicle treats?
:D
...
What have you done...
00,02Memme, all kinds
Phase4: Do you use any now?
Yay RD part
/me starts singing
/me X GON GIVE IT TO YA
Phase: one of the failed runs you need to see if a plain kerbal falling onto land splats
20% cooler remix gives me chills at RDs part.
/me FUCK WAIT FOR GET IT ON YOUR OWN
/me X GON DELIVER TO YA
No
00,02Memme, i play stock
I wan see Kerbal die
00,02needs more engine
Phase4: Like a baws.
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
FUCK
half the fuel tanks is enough
At the gala!
I am a SCIENTIST. I want to know what happens. Is that so evil?
Yay!
wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeew
>Unmute
BREAK THE SONIC SOUND BARRIER
>Art of the dress
POW
aw yeah
Phase4: DO A RAINBOOM!
nothing beats constructing a gatling dog launcher under heavy abuse of game physics
I know it. I tried playing it, but I couldn't get food, so everyone died
farming is easy
Uhm.
Is that supposed to happen?
mark a plot, get seeds ready
Gatling Dog Launcher?
SOUNDS FHAN
everything working as intented
nothing to see here
It's fine.
No immideate death here.
Phase4: one of the failed runs you need to release the kerbal when you are in the air, let it fall onto the ground and see if it splats. FOR SCIENCE
Was that spelled right?
what exploded?
00,02derpy_pony, adv sas module
`oh
do they splat in water?
we need to know
Phase4: In this game, do you have some kind of budget?
ded
lol
00,02Memme, thats planed for a future version
ouch
Memme no
Dat lag.
but eventually
Boom
Is a multiplayer version planned?
Phase4: It gets more and more realistic then.
00,02Memme, kinda
00,02but they will keep this mode
components have a price, Memme. but it has no effect so far
Phase4, I know it's awesome, make a giant rocket dildo
Phase4: I see.
with a budget, you can set mission goals and build campaigns
Phase4, DO it and I'll give u moar noodles
might be fun
ded
all good
Nothing like having Pinkie singing Giggle at the Ghosties while going on a suicide mission.
lol
this mission is 120% safe
there's nothing safer than Kerbal space planes
not enough
it won't reach the orbit
Hrafn: Except for any mode of transport that isn't kerbal
00,02hmmm
Ther's nothing more safe than Phase4s suicide planes.
:P
00,02isnt realy enough fuel for intercontinental flight
00,02this plane is absurdly safe
one more booster at the core plane fixes it
true
Phase4: Are you going with trial and error with your designs? xD
What?
Is he?
He is, isn't he?
:D
Yes
YS
Wow.
Balls of steel.
FOR SCIENCE
oh well, there's more Kerbals where that came from :P
Phase4 let him dai
RIGHT!
without the ballast, he might make the intercontinental jump
00,02well poo
WILL HE BURN
Is the rocket flying away from him?
Dat face
"fuck"
Kerbal face :I
lol
Does he go splat with the blood
he will be a beautiful shooting star
Keep calm and suffocate.
HNO
THE FUCKING SEA
uh...no air friction
dive!
lol
ded?
ded
Phase4, send them straight up and make them hit the ground pls
Alive in our hearts, but dead to all else
he was too weak for the space program
lol
00,02Pwnies, no
/me shits himself
AHHHHHHHHH
Why mean munstah yell at fwuffy
NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
derpy_pony: He has been terminated, to avoid further mishappenings for the space project.
well, on the bright side, there won't be much unemployment with the amount of astronauts that are hired
That went as planned :p
k...
...
lol
Awesome music timing.
everyone is safe
this music fits far too well :P
that was short
no worries
this is not the mun
Phase4: make him rebuild the shuttle
Phase4: oh see theres the problem...your ship blew up
11,02I'm off to bed, night all :)
"WE'RE GONNA DIE, AAAAH!!!" "KEEP THE FUCK DOWN!!" "My Little Pony!"
00,02bill says the ships busted
Goodnight SuperBrony64

Morning guys, night SuperBrony64 :)
MASF123: Night.

SuperBrony64: Night.
and good morning MegaMoonShine
good night MASF123
Oh, and MASF123
it's almost noon here
Good morning to be honest. Lol.
Same.
lol
5 minutes to noon here, but I consider that morning :P
it will probably collide with the ground at takeoff again
Wait, when is noon?
What is noon?
5 minutes to 5AM here, but I consider this afternoon
Memme: 12:00
12 uhr mittags
morning lasts until about 3 pm to me, regardless of when I wake up
erm...
MegaMoonShine: Ok, thnks.
Uh...
It's currently 10:56 where I'm at
This song!
Applejacks theme, right?
Holy crap, this song! :O
yup
11:57 for me.
try 5:56 am
Me Gusta Mucho.
yeah, the song is great
I have the other character themes, but not this one :$
that went well
LOL
EXPLOSIONZZ!!
Phase4 that was so funny
all targets neutralized
now hiring: astronauts
lol
^'
You can do it!
ded
Oh, no wait.
150% safe
what is this safe?
And 20% cooler.
And Twilights theme!
Win!
Memme: They are so alive though, even though they will die
I would send my neighbors children with this mission
they got helmets, they'll be fine
The wings are holding on this time! :O
well everypony i have to go
all three are panicking. this is rare
take care RainBowJack
RainBowJack: Bye.
bye bye
bye RainBowJack :)
Phase4: Did you forget the drugs in the oxygen again? D:
00,02must have
not yet
Oh, sweet Celestia, what have you done...
Frontflip!
oopsie
Quadruplenippe frontflip!
That looks under control.
Totally :D
What could possibly go wrong?
What MORE could possibly go wrong?
Twilights second theme?
Nope
RD's theme
Rainbows?
Right.
I thought it was familiar.
the core vehicle always survives
Kammerjunk: Hello.
Phase4: Moving vehicle in sync with music much?
The song fits pretty well
what if you don't throw the wings of, but install the rocket thrusters there too?
00,02Memme, nope
you can get rid of them later
+f
derpy_pony: that has too much mass to be a practical space craft
graceful like a crane
00,02like a boss
Blew up anyway
Is there a perfect design in ths game?
*this
all survived
Whaaat?
Who's theme now?
Oh wait, that's no theme.
this hurts my sense of aerodynamics...the friction would rip it apart
no theme, this is pinkiepieswear
derpy_pony: Welcome to the Internet :)
Derpy: it's held together with duct tape, nothing can rip it apart
Except air.
was this planned?
mayhaps...
Fireworks! NASA VERSION!
all three are happy
Dat flame.
nice
00,02soo much lag
the whole launching pad is a puddle of molten glass now
Yeah.
Physics! Yay!
launch pad?
grammar...
lol
Correct yourself; LIKE A BAWS!
this is one of the songs I have on endless loop for the metro
at morning, when everyone has this "must go work"-face
Gotta love that face.
Just turn up the volume, and the pretend to "accidently" unplug your headphones.
Blight.
Yes, I'm going to randomly rant.
Yellow.
What does this song happen to be? :S
haha
I'm soaked - teacup just decided to crack neatly down the middle from temperature shock.
fluttershy likes to be nice
Also, ow.
pepperbrony made it, iirc
Lasharus: Aren't they supposed to be able to hold those temperatures?
Well, this wasn't technically a teacup.
Rather a beer stein. I consume in large quantities.
Lasharus: Oh, lol.
so i came here cause i was playing slender
00,02i cant turn the engines off cause i need the thrust vectoring
Given the thickness of the glass though, I figured it'd be fine.
And it lasted for a good year or two. :P
RD4Life: Had fun?
Lasharus: Wow.
always
Ofcourse.
00,02and then i randomly lose controll of my craft
Still, near-boiling water all over me. Definite ow.
What would not be funny with being chased through a forest by Slenderman, right?
no...this is fluttershy likes being nice
Lasharus: Burn wounds?
Thankfully, no.
the other one was in the same download folder
Thank Celestia for pants?
If that'd happened, I wouldn't be rambling in here, I'd be curled up in the foetal position mewling at myself while my neighbour calls a doctor or drags me into the shower and turns it up full blast on cold. :P
we need to fire the orbital friendship cannon at the slenderman. thats probably why he be creepin so hard
Either or, really. :P
Lasharus: Right.
Brb.
00,02dis will take a while
Nvm.
Phase4: Speed up?
00,02cant
lol what is this?
RD4Life: Excactly.
...What is this?
IDEA!
Phase4: Celestia needs you to put up an Orbital Friendship Cannon in orbit.
HerpDerp: Kerbal Space Program
00,02hmmmm
Aha
no idea what this is but the 3 things in the corner look terrified
Phase4: It is a glorious mission, requiring skills and patience.
Phase4: Are you up for it?
00,02i just flew past debrie from a previous mission
00,02Memme, i can try
Phase4: So you can actually collide with previous missions?
Phase4: Nice.
00,02you can have multiple simultaions missions
no chute
Phase4: Really?
go go go
00,02yep
Phase4: 20% cooler, instantly.
00,02problem with this design
00,02it works
00,02perfectly
night everypony~
chute....you disappoint me
00,02night Shamroc
bye bye Shamroc
00,02untill mid orbit
00,02when for no reason it suddenly stops working
Ohai everypony :3
Phase4: Bug? Or laws of physics?
hi Spell-of-Gaming
00,02i lose thrust vectoring on the lower stage
Ohai Spell-of-Gaming :)
Spell-of-Gaming: Hello!
00,02which i kinda need
Sometimes I wish I have a debit card. :I
hi everyone
hi Lil_B :)
hi Lil_B :3
hi Lil_B
lol brb gonna watch rooster teeth for a bit
Phase4: Wait, if you're going to put a O.F.C in orbit it needs to be struck onto a rocket.
...what the heck is wrong with uTorrent.
hi MegaMoonShine Hrafn and crazypony :)
00,02yeah
00,02Memme, not sure how to lift it
Phase4: Unless you can craft it together in space.
When the stream needs a good bufferin', its download speed is becoming lower.
00,02what should the cannon look like?
00,02Memme, not yet
00,02i REALY want that feature
00,02because then i could build a space station
Phase4: That would be cool.
Phase4: I need to find out how the O.F.C looks.
Like a giant laser maybe?
Hmmm.
I made a picture, but I'm afraid of Uploading it to DA, because the Thumbnail-Picture may looks like a swastike :/
swastika*
?
hi Panda :)
I'm still finding a debit card. :I
Lil_B, :D hiya
Lil_B: could always try shrinking it down and see how it looks before uploading
Phase4: It's either that or this one:
http://derpy.me/ov0Ip
I've been participating in contests on Reddit, but alas, no luck. :(
Phase4: Too bad I need to go and eat.
Phase4: Might miss it, but I'll hurry.
Bye all.
00,02k
00,02later Memme
Bye Memme :)
Hrafn i did that, and it does look like a swastika when you shrink it :/ http://imgur.com/eWtnq

Phase4: We gonna begin to fire friendship and love all around the planet now? :3
Hey, MaxTheBrony.
hai MaxTheBrony
:)
Phase4: I wonder if you could use a bunch of landing gear on two different ships to create a sort of 'locking' mechanism to build a space station
i reached the part were dashie ran away this story is not really sad
00,02i'm quite proud of that
00,02hmmmm
Gooood morning Bronystate!
A space station that refuels your spaceship if needed?
killerpony7733: I'm talking about this version right now. stock parts and such
hai MaidSurge
MaidSurge: Hiya
Gooood morning MaidSurge :)
killerpony7733: It wouldn't server any purpose but looking cool

Phase4: Lol the kerbals are loving the rolling
00,02killerpony7733, ikr

:D
killerpony7733, http://i.imgur.com/Lt9oZ.png Gotcha
lmao
haha
Jim: Hah sumi in a nutshell in KSP
those images just made my day :P
He just sends the most defective spacecraft out and enjoys when it plunges to the ground
:D
but wait, there is more http://i.imgur.com/AnyG4.png
Still going to the moon i see?
killerpony7733: the correct way to play kerbal methinks :D
oh god, can't stop laughing
MadSurge: Well trying to make the kerbal race go extinct is a good goal tbh :O
No Major_Frank we're preparing the orbital friendship defence system
killerpony7733: there's always three more :D
Ah...
http://i.imgur.com/LUkl0.gif
Because going to the moon didnt worked out
D:
Apparently not, Major_Frank :D
Luna's doesn't get that many visits with this game
doesn't mean the kerbals won't stop trying
I just told my friend i was a brony xD
He searched brony on Knowyourmeme
Major_Frank: what did he say :P?
Did he http://i.imgur.com/LUkl0.gif
And he was like EVERYTHING IS COMING TOGHETER NOW
Its so clear!
IT ALL MAKES SENSE
How did i not know about it?!
Scootaloo! Equestria!
I make pony references all the time you see
:p
Without him knowing
So I'm guessing he's gonna check the show out?
He esploded
twice?
Major_Frank: :D did you blow his mind?
do you say scootaloo and equestria in conversation?
Can you do that?
I exploded twice once
haha
My cat's name is Scootaloo and i told about him
Oh yes this song!
Epic song
DB_Brony, Like, instead of saying "BRB; going to the toilet" You say "BRB, going to EQUESTRIA"
This song <3
Time for Luna :D
Gigas singing yesterday ^^ wonderful
Jim: :D
so you compare your bathroom with equestria?
Major_Frank: is your cat orange?
My toilet is the secret gateway to Equestria
They're both filled with joy and dangerous creatures, RD4Life
00,02i stuffed that up bad
oh snap
xD
Sometimes Madsurge
look out for the hydra
Phase4: trying to make a munar orbital canon?

O.o
I would sometimes drop the "and that's how equestria was made" line
Nvm :)

:|
I play WoW!
RD4Life: I think there are alot playing just a bit spread around
maybe a bit too spread around
I used to play wow

00,02oh crap
00,02one sec
13sun is up now.. not sure if i will be able to sleep..
alexxm: Ive been good :) , you?
Shizuschlafen: That moment...
13i have gone a night without sleep before... it is not pretty..
00,02i hate those kind of days
This game looks like a puzle game... mate's... I fo NOT like this.
i'm good MaxTheBrony
00,02i've gone two, it only gets worse from there
/me 00,02hugs Shizuschlafen
TheRandomkid321: Why don't you like puzzle games?
ARMA II Is mainly big because of Day Z.
Shizuschlafen: Try an afternoon nap with lucid dreming.
*Dreaming
And the mission editor TheRandomKid321
i lost about a pound in a month
TheRandomkid321: Soo?
just realized its the last day of the steam sale
Oh crap
BUY. EVERYTHING.
13will be too sleepy for lucid
Memme I dont hate them... Just un;ess they have humor involved like the portal games I just dont find em interesting.
Shizuschlafen: Sleepyness helps. And you get energy even if you wall asleep.
13not that
TheRandomkid321: Ok.
so what game is this
13i have found i am frequently too tired mentally to care that i am dreaming
Q.U.B.E
Lol i've been looking at my Gmail for like 2 weeks now xD
Guys i just fin my little dashie and wow i did not cry but i can feel that stuff in my heart
Damn you Valve!
Shizuschlafen: I know the feel
the Derpdash
Shizuschlafen: Same. But you can atleast try it for the sake of energy.
thanks Derpdash
np
If this game doesn't have a dark backstory I am dissapoint.
O.o This looks better than i thought it would
13it's like "hm, i'm dreaming.. oh well let's see how this goes"
xMLPxREACTORx You should try listening to an audiobook. Things are much more emotional for me when I hear them.
Shizuschlafen: Well. Bad luck.
so what do you do in this game
the ending made me want to cry
So THAT is what you do.
Minecraft meets portal.
what is this game?
TheRandomkid321: Excactly.
QUBE
im already confused :P
13i think it took me 2.5 hours to clear qube the first time... let's see how fast phase goes
this game seems intresting
alexxm: It does, doesn't it?
yep Memme
is there another fanfic one that is not sad
does it have a storyline at all?
If this game doesn't have a dark backstory, I am dissapoint.
13think portal but without the dialogue, it's about the same
Derpdahs what does it look like?
13strange environment with physics based tests
13gets weird later
nope
Good morning, everypony! :)
Dear Esther has a pretty awesome story though..
RaveBrony: Good morning!
But you cant really call that a game..
but the dialogue of portal was amazing
13dear esther has a story?
hi RaveBrony :)
Major_Frank: I need to try it out.
hai RaveBrony
how you doing RaveBrony
Does anypony have tribes ascend?
13i thought it was a guy rambling into a microphone then building a pretty world and completely forget he's designing for an interactive medium
Shizuschlafen, Yatzhee went as far and called Dear Ester "Not a game at all"
...
/me waves to Memme, Lil_B, Jim and alexxm
13yahtzee reviewed?
Im doing good alexxm, and yourself?
13i thought that was totalbiscuit
i'm good RaveBrony
He mentioned it in some video I believe
Who's yahtzee again?
13zero punctuation, yellow background guy
oooh
Memme the zero punctuation guy
Ahh.
I see.
right
Thanks.
I confuzzled those two for a moment
it was Totalbiscuit
13totalbiscuit is the "wtf is X" vids
Yeah.
I have hated totalbiscuit ever since he insulted bronies... i cant watch him anymore.
The cynical brit.
13which btw convinced me to get frozen synapse and risk factions :3
When did he do it!? TheRandomkid321
TheRandomkid321: He did?
TheRandomkid321 when did that happen
o.O
13he's a bit egotistical but eh
reset button :D
he's got personality a plenty, that's for sure
13snuggle truck
but it's enjoyable to watch
Did he?
Wow.
You can't link videos here, right?
He can Pm :3
if he got the time
Right.
Say the title i look it myself
or that ^^
WTF is SNuggletruck. And in one of his Teraria videos. In the terraria video he says "You are probably one of the people who accept bronies in their fandom despite their stupidity."
13eh
TheRandomkid321: ...
Well.
Watch WTF is snuggletruck.
13face it bronies are the new furries, just more sane
When does he talk about bronies?
Yep.
exactly
At what stampt
Hey my friend is a furry!
And bronie
So?
Hey! My friend is a pony!
:O
my lttle dashie is one of the best and sadest stroys i ever read
13getting that back of the head "shizuuuu why you awake" feeling...
Yep.
Anyway I wish not to continue this conversation any longer. I can TELL it is going int he wrong direction.
Aw
Not this game
xMLPxREACTORx: Agreed.
hi everypony :)
00,02very straight foward
I'm not even sure what a furry is.
hey ninja how've you been
/me 00,02hugs Shizuschlafen again
awesome mate
Memme many different definitions.
Heya ninja :)
TheRandomkid321: Should I just Google it?
Also, Hi everyone, I'm back. I was play Gee Tee Ahh : Eypeesowdes Frume Leebity Seetry
hey ninja
Memme be careful but yes.
a ball
SUDDENLY
TheRandomkid321: Ok.
A BALL
this is no longer logic
A BALL! YAY!
So it ISNT minecraft meets portal... there is a sphere.
Memme: ^^ i advice you to dont
/me uses Blocks to play with his ball
/me *mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm*
/me is Hitler
...
xD
....
Dude did you google Furries ^^
*ellipsis*
oh i get it!
Wat
How did anyone not know about furries
what on earth are you guys watching
the players inside one of those insane asylums!
MaxTheBrony: Yes.
^^
this is all in his head!
ahh its that puzle gmae
game*
MEMME YOU DIDN'Y KNOW WHAT A FURRY WAS
What is Chrysalis doing here?
The game is called QUBE
/me shits himself
i'm always here
Pwnies STop this madness
Pwnies: I am not entirely shure, no.
*sure
^^
/me :O
Pwnies: wait what...
I always doubt what I think I know...
I think there is Two deffinitions of furries
lol
can you die in this game
Phase4 you silly filly
First one is?
Pwnies this isnt a roleply site... No matter WHAT you're intp.
Ones wich are for adults and other for ... Well i dont know :)
00,02now there getting better
One are people who dress up in fursuits.
...
yeah
And the other one is porn?
The other masterbate to furry porn :)
Eyup
can i remind everyone discussion of adult material is not allowed
Including myself
Chrysalis: Sorry.
00,02this is actually very much like portal, each level is trivial and demonstrates cleanly a new concept
this game mentally hurts me 6_9
remember to read the rules
00,02BUT
A BIG BUT
00,02it doesnt have the humor
Chrysalis: I tried to keep it from coming ut :P so litteraly
out*
00,02and that distracted from the triviality of it in portal
Phase4: No dark backstory? D:
00,02and yes, i will compare every puzle game with portal
The humour adds so much to portal
00,02Memme, well not that i can see
i loved portal's jokes
Phase4: Everyone will for a long time
00,02Chrysalis, it does
Its a clever game though
Phase4 it was critisized for being so much like Portal. But that hardly anything because the people who Portal made this :P
lol
So there's no story to this?
00,02you'd think that'd be a plus
Nope
00,02Memme, the trailer sugested a minor one
Pwnies: um citation needed?
00,02but nothing explicit
I dont think valve made this
Phase4: Hope it comes later then.
Basically it's portal-like puzzles. But nothing to break it up. It's like IWBTG. but with less rage
Pwnies: you are not confusing this with quantum conundrum?
D: this seems like a good puzzle game but from an estethic point of view it looks real dull
really?
i quite like the look
nice and clean
hello everypony
with no brown
Should I go with the name I have now or Emil?
True but its abit repedative in its look dont you think?
Texasboykc09: Hello.
/me Agrees with MaxTheBrony
Heya Texasboykc09 :)
It has the potential to be a great game. but they focused mainly on gameplay, not so much as to make people want to play it :P
how you doing Texasbokc09
how you doing Texasboyc09
some people like puzzle games just for the sake of puzzles
Is there ANYTHING POSITIVE About it so far?
like me ^_^
lol
Pwnies its a great game though, its for a specific set of players
Key word being some
Yeah and for those this game sure is awesome
Not most
It has a new concept!
yeah that's why puzzle games usually don't get mainstream
even though this game isnt for me i love the idea of it
they knew there market and made the game for it
and didnt just play it safe
So in all. If you like puzzle games, and don't really mind there being no story, this game wouuld be a good investment
Have this game made money?
Did this game sale*
sell
Yes and no
...
Oh :p ty
It definately sold
sell*
sold.
I meant for mine xD
Oh.
Sorry i will not fix past problems :)
Didn't he already correct it, though?
puzzle complete
HUZZAH! Next level!
yeah i know :p
that one looked fun
sorta...
This game is definately not for me
I love portal
But I don't have the patient to actually complete it
that one looked easy :/
Really?
^^
yeah
This shit just got scary.
Hi all :)
Someone's controlling you.
Heya Major
Major: Hello!
ohai new puzzle introduction
Simple so far.
Nope.
Portal was a great example of a good puzzle game
Not anymore.
^^
But everyone trys to be like it
They just went into 3 dimensional thinking.
Pwnies not really, they ended up making way too many concessions to make it easier
Or more.
But end up taking large portions of it from the original gma itslef
there were entire puzzle elements removed cause playtesters thought they were too hard
which is a shame cause they were the best ones
Pwnies: like what for example?
Chrysalis: Like what?
pneumatic differentials were removed, and the crushers had a much lower usage
:O
Pneumatic differentials?
if you looked at the early trailers, they showed launching vertically through crushers, this was originally a level, but removed cause the playtesters moaned it was too scary
Bye everypony i going to sleep
...I'm not sure if I want my Steam profile picture to be Ayu from Kanon. :U
Chrysalis: xD
xMLPxREACTORx: Bye.
What Now?
Bye xMLPxREACTORx :)
Chrysalis: Too scary? Too awesome, they mean.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbu-tzA4GbM
oops
sorry phase
but that link is to the pneumatic demo
Chrysalis: Write a letter and force them to make a directors cut of portal
Phase4: Try turning it back again!
D:
they wont now though
Lower the yellow
D:
thats why they released the map maker
so they didnt have to do DLC
trap the ball in between the yello and red
Back :P
close the yellow
Back again.
Raise the red one

I would've spent my iTunes card there. :P
Btw do i need to download anything to play on Pf2 servers? like mods or somthing?

You can pull off all 3 guilds + 2 great houses with skill

00,02hmm
Go kitty people! :P
/me purrs
dat morrowingd theme
if you know game: Make Altmer mage with no magica regeneration birthsign .. I like mages..
00,02dat texture
00,02they just took a house cat and a camera
you could have installed some mods to make it look better
everything is 20% cooler with a tail :D
Best elder scrolls theme imo
especially character models
Phase4: khajit then she can be a silleh kitteh :3
Yea, it does XD
00,02red_ony, but that would require me to know that
:)
00,02Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, :D

Eargasms
00,02: D
00,02and they can wear those boots right
00,02the quick ones
Just take whatever you fance..I'D only advice against the beast races
and no closed helmets
oh misread
yeah Phase4 just do wat ever race you want
kajit and argonians cant use closed helmets and boots
00,02red_ony, wait
00,02boots of blinding speed
00,02i want those
00,02kajit cant wear those?
no phase, you want SKOOMA
I don't think so...
Phase4: Oo why did you decide to play this TES instead of skyrim?
In fact, the only noticeable weakness is what it shares with Argonians. The restriction of limited headgear and outright lack of shoes takes away a lot of things you can use.
00,02nothing to sugest i cant wear them on uesp
ahahahhahaa
i need to go to uesp
I just quoteed uesp
unlike in skyrim thieves guild. i actually need to look how to do this up
00,02fffuuuuuuu
00,02i cant be kitty
00,02can i change now or do i have to restart/
u gotta restart
I think theyll ask you if you are contend with character in the end
00,02dat quit button
aww sorry bout that Phase4 been ages since i've played MW
yeah these games usaully offer a chance to change the character at the end of the tutoraial bit
there is a console command for it as well
to get the character creation screen
Dat same voice actor in Oblivion
Dat Redguard voice
00,02brenton has magic bonuses
00,02Gunthler, i think he's in skyrim too
breton is nice enough :)
take different head though
:D
00,02dear god these faces are ugly
Why am I having a sudden nolastiga
dat hair
o_o
ugh
I think every race has a singly not fugly head choice :D
So despite having access to the Guild Wars 2 beta, I haven't logged in at all this weekend >_>
OtakuTom: lol same
Dat awkward walking
00,02mage or theif?
Why not both? xD
Instead, I've been gearing up my priest in WoW...lol
00,02why not
why not custom?
:D
so many choices... :)
Is illusion still similar to oblivion's illusion?
damn it
my security is too low for this mission
well. time to loot some shit
mysticism is also kind of nice for traveling spells if I recall corectly
Dat obsurd name XD
lol
I'd later change primary thing to magic..it is harder to level
00,02'Detect Key'?

Good evening.

00,02what about shadow?
00,0260s invisibility
00,02when i screw things up i can leg it

lol still can't refrain yourself from looting absolutly everything can you Phase?
and drop items from there to the ground
aaah

stealing everything
Just take off your clothes and run around the town. It's fun.
XD
my steam names alexxm1
well..he got nothing..
inb4 over-encumbered
I dunno about you guys, but I think his crime may or may not have been reported
The guard takes everything he stole away
they keep saying that but nothing happens
if he had droped it to the ground from inventory
that wouldn't have happened
^^
chat froze?
oh ^^
steal everything. XD
take all the things

AdamTheDuck , MegaMoonShine , and twi_sprinkle_GS17 what am I watching here?
oni_link: the elder scrolls morrowing
*morrowind
The agony of someone watching an old game. The pain.
THe magical land of morrowind my dear oni_link
playing*
ah thanks :P
dat impatience
Phase4: why did you decide to switch from skyrim to morrowind? or will you be playing both?
Skyrim crashes twi_sprinkle_GS17
I don't think there is anything wrong with older games, if they are still entertaining then they are stilly playable. Ocarina of Time is a prime example of that.
00,02twi_sprinkle_GS17, i'll be playing all sorts of things randomly
whos streaming?
Malmortius: phase
well i'm gonna go and do stuff elsewhere, later
Phase4: sounds fun :D
00,02ohai Malmortius
hi babe
bye Twily
Bye Twily
AdamTheDuck: at which part does it crash?
twi_sprinkle_GS17: I phase said at whiterun
No quest markers for you phase!
guize what's a good SCP to read?
but that was a while ago, he might have fixed it
fuck quest markers...seriously
This is what i love about morrowind, you have to use the actual directions.
AdamTheDuck: aw, that sucks, before even the dragon battle
another thing I like: no quick travel :D
Malmortius: They test you and see if you were paying attention pretty much :D
quick travel.. stupidest thing ever
red_ony: i would hate havign no quick travel
morrowind has 7 types of travel
quick travel saves so much time
Create a full game, make the ability to skip over it.
I think
flawless logic
in the northwest is an insanely powerful and easy to get artifact. the amulet of shadows. 80% chameleon for 60 seconds, iirc
Malmortius: well i dont want to waste hours on walking, idont have that kind of time
3 teleportations spells, the insect transport, boat, mage guilds and dunmer fortress teleport
Overexaggurating to prove your point sprinkle, it never takes hours
a good company will make the traveling interesting
Malmortius: not at once of course, but in total.
:D
ded
its not like the game forces you to quick travel
That's gotta hurt O__0
Dem punching sound effects
Well then i say, tough shit, in all honesty.
Malmortius: As long as you offer a faster means of transport then it doesn't matter the distance. And by doing that, you still allow the player to be immersed and get there in a timely fashion.
leroy jenkens?
I agree, transport rather than fast travel
lol
twi_sparkle there is no alternative to quick travel though...like the travel methods of mw
Im ok with some kind of fast transport, just not fucking instant from anywhere
Malmortius: lol i can say the same about qick travel. just because you dont like it doesnt mean you have to whine about it, nobody is forcing you to use it
Malmortius: It just takes you out of the game. Instant blows. /)
mudcrab boxing
Thats what all casuals say oni
no autoheal
in b4 no regenerating anything
Its why games these days have regenerating health and crap
no recoil on guns.. regenerating mana even for god sakes
with strong enchantments, you can fill your health bar in a few seconds anyway. but not as noob char
in morrowind you can really brake the game if you know what you are doing
I like the freedom
same
Malmortius: Nah, thats just what I honestly believe. I can do without regen too but I'm very nitpicky about quick travel. Its not as fun to me.
talk to the elf!
aaaw
red_ony: Seen the quickest known speedrun of it?
jup
Guy gets to the last area in the matter of a minute
alchemy
?
Again, you're basing your experience off games that use fast travel as a way to not have to put effort into big portions of the game
brew int potions, drink them, brew more int potions with buffed stats, drink these int potions, infinite stats
If there was no fast travel people would take the time to make content in these areas
as example
well..he found a transport
when I first played I didn't
and walked to balmora:D
it's not far
still :)
and you can even fight a rat or two
Beware, i has a candle stick
00,02Wait
00,02what
Malmortius: yup. and this is why Im against it. If we had devs who actually thought of making traveling part of the experience, then that would be the end of it.
00,02'if i start to bore you about morrowind lore, just let me know'
00,02>ask about lore
00,02'read a book or something'
NEVER
;)
master of the candlestick
Im sort of even ok with the caravan travel thing in skyrim, its still instant and its almost crossing the line, but at least you have to actually go to it and pay
instead of just teleporting from freakin anywhere
lmao
thats enough theif! *takes everything*
hes fucked
now he has to swim all the way around :/
Yikes
This music tho :D
^ ^ ^
Good ol balmora
this is where i spent my childhood

GilDash: You are using a IRC client
You can see people joining leaving etc
killerpony7733: Yeah, it's alright. Not really impressed with it.

STEAL THE GEMS
YOUR OCD CALLS TO IT
I also like theres no big "YOU ARE ABOUT TO STEAL THIS ITEM" marker
Like the item turning red ro some crap..
yup
also you can sell stolen goods no nproblem
back in my days, we had a thing called common sense
just not to the person you stole it from
hahaha
lol
You mean merchants don't magically know what items have been stolen and which haven't?
suddenly explosion
What sorcessary is this>
yup :D
what just happened
AdamTheDuck: literally :D
00,02u have no clue where to go
00,02i'
00,02i have no clue wherre to go
got caught stealing from the mages guild
00,02derp

THIEVES GUILD, wait was there even a Thieve's Guild in Morrowind?
00,02oh, i already found that guy Malmortius
the guy who wanted to give you orders has some. the guilds too
00,02AdamTheDuck, i think there is
Oh.
I didn't read what cassius said, but I think it's along the lines of "get stronger and get equipment"
there is
in the southwall
THEN THE THIEVES GUILD WILL BE PERFECT FOR YOUR OCD PHASE
lol
Well, the world is free Phase. Do anything you like, id recommend a guild you're specialised in. Its niot like skyriml, you cant complete every guild with any character

I tired to finally get some volume into my songs by properly mastering them, I don't know if I succeeded
I tried*
everypony, i want everyone to take a moment to remember the 2011 osla/utoya attack, as today is it's memorial. 77 lives were lost that day. and to me thats a heavy loss, and it should be respected.
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-move-it-football-head.jpg
Phase4, now, you are supposed to have your weapons :3

New episode of Yugioh Abridged.
well that was a well respected moment of silence -_-x Thank you, streamer for "theme appropriate" music.
oh man oh god, oh god oh man oh god oh man!
They finally wrap up the virtual reality plot. No more Noah!
Lil_B: :D
nopony knows the 2011 osla/utoya attack, do they?
00,02i told him not to ware a red shirt
00,02he didnt listen
herostar_Discorded was in sweden or norwegen? (I fI'm thinking about the right thing)
herostar_Discorded: I honestly dont but I am sorry for the family of the victims...
herostar_Discorded: didn't know anyone there personally
Phase4: part of the fun
the norwegian capitol was the place, Lil_B
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-werent-we-all-curious-at-that-age.png WHAT THE BLOODY SHIT?!
Bronysith: What the shit indeed O____0
Bronysith: what is this I dont even
herostar_Discorded thanks, than its the one I was thinking about
it was bombed. massively. it was 77 people killed, kids, men, mothers, dads, some left with no family some losing some family
it was a massive deal. and today is the memorial.
time goes by fast
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-thanks-ants-thants.jpg
not long and it will be 10 years agi
ago
/me is afk, vakuuming his room
Phase4 if you crouch while sniping it will become steadier iirc
being a pagan, i don't just ignore a mass death that large. it affects my magicka and my lifeforce, makes my mood darker. i also mourn the event, and pray for those who were killed and the families that were devastated.
that, is not, something someone ignores. no matter where you're from.
00,02i'ma go to bed soon
Phase4: oh no you dont
00,02will probably redo the intro with a different character
00,02i want biotics
Phase4: thats why i rolled adept
it is, herostar_Discorded. becoming entangled in it or not is a conscious choice
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-uunghh.jpg
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-why-isnt-there-a-dragon-ball-meme-site.jpg lololololololololololololo
the game is generally either soldier/biotic/other
derpy_pony be that as it is, i choose to remember and to mourn.
but you have no right to speak for others
killerpony7733: I'm not on stream, so which ME is he playing?
GilDash: ME1
what game is this?
mass effect
killerpony7733: Oh, Okay. I might bring stream up then.
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-human-weapon.jpg
so this is mass effect... i hear people are making a big deal over the endings, unless i have the wrong game.
lmao
herostar_Discorded, only the 3rd one
/me shrugs
it looks good. might try it sometime..
if i put down skyrim.
mass effect 3 was delivered with unsatisfying endings. heard this was fixed later
...
i have yet to play mass effect 3
still need to beat 2 on pc then buy 3
same here
played only the first part
second was different, so I didn't get into it

whoa
MegaMoonShine: (\
Bronysith: spot on :D
oni_link: and all the fanboys fall for it every year
it is the SAME EXACT GAME
hello
lennon made intellectual masterpieces like "love love love, yeah yeah yeah"
hello ThrackerzodR :)
how you doing Thrackerzod
Bronysith: Every year. :D COD 4 was the only step foward and then they came to the conclusion that people will buy that same game every year
morning guys :3
00,02well
00,02that was unexpected

-smacks guy in head- oh he'll be fine. "yeah i guess you're right."
yes i love asshole shepard
Spitfire: 1
Bronysith: yeah, thats more accurate. Also, I like how the rating systems dont work since kids whine to their parents to buy em M rated games...
Bronysith : dat loki
Blam
and he ded
oni_link: seriosly i think little kids shouldnt be able to buy games from their parents anyways
oni_link: thats why i like pc gaming. less whiny brats then xbox
That is one gigantic ship.
this is me1 right
Yes ThrackerzodR
Bronysith: Still some huge douchebags however when you end up meeting them
SHOOT ER DOWN
lol.
ShadowD3mon when you said Gigantic i thougt about Gigabit :P
he's a changeling!
Bronysith: Its too complex for them, too expensive to keep running and its not all over the media like the xbox is. I used to love my 360 but the kids, the fanboys, and the inferior capabilities have turned me over to PC. In two months I get a new tower so I can ditch XBOX completely.
lol.
oni_link: WOOOT. what ur steam id?

smooze!
OH SHIT :O
wtf am i watching?!?
twi_sprinkle_GS17: lets be honest. the elder scrolls mmo wont work
Bronysith: you realize how many peopel you just called stupid
Bronysith: damn it. That would have been fun too. and yeah, that didnt really catch my interest. this skyrim mmo is too much like the rest. Fallout would have been more original :/
DERP DERP DERPY!
/me feels dusted
twi_sprinkle_GS17: i am only calling the people who actually think skyrim is the best rpg ever stupid
twi_sprinkle_GS17: no where near the best rpg ever
Bronysith;That shit nasty as hell.
Bronysith: maybe not. but its a fun game
DERPY!
loll
smooooOOOooooozzzzeeee
DERPY DERPY DERPY!
Bronysith: whats the best rpg?
twi_sprinkle_GS17: it is...never said it was bad, but i dont like how it seems that people who dont even game know what it is
lulz.jpg
Bronysith: its called PR.
twi_sprinkle_GS17: dungeons and dragons board game
Bronysith: which is what turned me off of most FPS titles
?.jpg
twi_sprinkle_GS17: lets see, you make your own character with his or her own backstory
RPG is such a big word... I hate it when people argue if something like Final fantasy is better than Elder Scrolls, even though these games are so fundementally different
lol.
Seriously?
Hi.
Lil_B: gamers need chillout..
Hi SuperGotenks1989 :)
Hello SuperGotenks1989 :)
Lil_B: final fantasy 7 is my fav jrpg
hey SuperGotenks1989 how've you been
hi SuperGotenks1989
Lil_B: they are both good for different reasons although I have to admit I don't like the direction FF has gone lately. X was my favorite.
twi_sprinkle_GS17: true.
Lil_B: actually. chrono trigger ff6 ff7 are tied for my fav game of all time
Can anyone tell me how to find Return of Cooler with Original JAP Audio?
twi_sprinkle_GS17: at least we arent as nerdy as religious people...
Bronysith mine is Earthbound, Mother 3 and FF6 :)
Bronysith: orly? what about the console war :P
:O CUPCAKES.
Lil_B FF4 Mother 3 :P
twi_sprinkle_GS17: true. but i never seen a massive war happen where millions die over xbox and ps3
oni_link yes, FF has dropped in quality, but I was speaking more theorethycal anyway :)
twi_sprinkle_GS17: "Your religion is different from mine. WAR TIME"
Lil_B: ah well point taken lol.
Bronysith: well religion just has more power due to its past. back in the day it was just a reason for war
also, I have to admit that I have never played the big RPGs...
ThrackerzodR Mother makes me cry every time in any situation T.T
oni_link: try out the original deus ex
War between ps3 and xbox 360 happens on youtube. ikr wtf?
FF7, Chrono Trigger, hell even super mario rpg. :D
it is one of the most interesting games i have played
Bronysith: religion was just a reason, the ultimate goal was wealth and power
Bronysith: Will do.
oni_link me nether XD, never played any Kind of RPG exept the 3 I just listed XD
Lil_B: haha we are the anomaly :D
oni_link: the door is locked. A(pick it) B(hack it) C(blow it down)
Bronysith: anyway,have you ever played star wars jedi academy? loved that game
twi_sprinkle_GS17: twas good
twi_sprinkle_GS17: KoToR?
i loved kotor
twi_sprinkle_GS17: I have it and play it rarely
fucking steam port is buggy though...
Bronysith: i played the second one, too lazy to play the first one
Bronysith: Ill go with A because B is less likely to happen and C is riddiculous :D
twi_sprinkle_GS17: the first one is fantastic man. with one of the biggest plot twists in gaming history
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/rage-comics-rage-comics-i-will-never-complain-about-my-job-again.png
killerpony7733: ive occasionally playing it over the last 5 years, so much fun with cheats if you spawn stuff
Can I post a Link to a song I made? (Chiptune)
Bronysith: maybe ill try it sometime, idk tho. i wish theyd remake jedi academy with newer steam engine
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-yo-dawg-i-head-you-like-cats1.jpg
Lil_B: I love chiptunes, I make some myself. :3
twi_sprinkle_GS17: lololo. but it is made by bioware before tehy sold their souls to EA
:D
oni_link what programms do you use?
MFW this is too damn true http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-apologies-japan.jpg
I only use Famitracker at the moment but Im thinking of trying out ModPlug and maybe try sampling and using FL Studio
Bronysith: aw, i really wanted a remake, couldve been so muc fun with the newer physics engine. i really liked how they did force moves in the original, none of that fancyuass force unleashed crap
Bronysith: LMAO :D
Bronysith: idk, when i think of Japan, i think of awesome tech
oni_link I tried a Tracker once, they are rather different than other music programms XD
twi_sprinkle_GS17: yea. it was a good game and not just a god of war rip off
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Revan, (the main bad guy in KoToR) is my fav sith of all time
Bronysith: yeah, force unleashed is riddiculous, the dude destroyed a star destroyer with the force
What about Darkstalkers? You know, with Pyron/
*?
Lil_B: Yeah, you gotta learn effect triggers and how to sequence :D Ive gotten used to it, they were really intimidating at first :P What you you use?
Darth Revan is best sith lord
anyway, just in case someone wants to see it (there is no mod or stream around anyway..) here is the link XD http://soundcloud.com/lilb-7/chinatown-parade
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Ikr, overpowered much?
oni_link Linux Multimedia Studio (windows Version)
MegaMoonShine: yeah, the whole 'force' concept is getting so blurred its turning into magic
Lil_B: nice
twi_sprinkle_GS17: i guess what i want is just more high quality games to come out. good graphics or not
oni_link but I think for Chiptunes good trackers are better, because they usually can everything the console should do
twi_sprinkle_GS17: 'Tis a shame :(
oni_link its for free :)
twi_sprinkle_GS17: it seems most companies are either focused on making the best graphics or trying to make motion controls...
MegaMoonShine: indeed..thats why i liked jedi academy, i liked how they represented force moves there, and very fun too
Bronysith: everything big is crappy nowadays, whether its music, gaming, or anything
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Also the most true and closest you would get to how it would be irl
twi_sprinkle_GS17: yup
with light saver fighting
saber*
Lil_B: And that's why I love Famitracker, it's pretty much emulating the NES/Famicom environment and you have to work within that. And I liked your song, the pitch sliding was pretty cool :P
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Never played that one, heard it's supposed to be good though
i know how to use a katana in real life. so thats why i want a lightsaber
killerpony7733: prolly yeah, it made more sense than the force unleashed stuff
oni_link thanks... yeah, the "sliding"... ... it isn't really sliding XD I can't really slide in LMMS
MegaMoonShine: i recommend it, been like 8 years since i beat it, i still play it occasionally. also a lot of fun with the cheat codes like spawning and other stuff
BAHAHHAHAHHA :D http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/video-game-memes-video-games-in-case-you-missed-microsofts-press-conference.png
Lil_B: well , you could have fooled me haha
oni_link its a bund of 1/192 notes XD
bunch*
Lil_B: lol that work around :D
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/koma-comic-strip-comixed-my-precious.jpg
oni_link there are 2 major things I hate about LMMS, not beeing able to slide properly and not beeing able to strech samples or transpose samples without streching/shortening them
Hey again :)
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-books.jpg
I would like to be able to make songs like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ_YfhfX6mM oni_link
Lil_B: Yeah, that sounds confusing and the same problem on Famitracker. Also ,yesh Virt is amazing!!!!!
Ohai MaxTheBrony :3

MaxTheBrony: IT'S TRUE! I have played 27 hours in the past 2 weeks! :'(

Doh ho ho. But I could worse. MUCH WORSE :3

Lil_B: I also want to be good enough to do stuff like this! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gtGeZ2wOmo Im hoping youve heard this one before
Ponies47: *
ponibas: Tab fail 1 for today
hey guys, any tips on how to get through the first level of Mega Man X?
Lil_B: 14 HOURS O_O
Ponies47 I just got it and MLP hadn't been invented yet :(
String_Shredder: the very first level?
oni_link: yeah
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH WHY GOD WHY?! http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-im-pretty-sure-taylor-swift-would-disagree.jpg
Lil_B: Ah I see. I started playing the game like a month ago
Ponies47: you just lost...
String_Shredder: if i rememver correctly, you just gotta worry about the crumbling floors
Bronysith: ?
Bronysith: -_(\
Bronysith kill it with fire
I don't think Sonic 4 gets enough love
oni_link: I'm avoiding those, but everything else is shooting me!
Bronysith: What?
I have never heard that before, but It sounds good
String_Shredder: charge the blaster and blow em away
!
oni_link what I really want to do is work with that Noise-Channel correctly :/ like in this song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNfkWrfcpBQ
Lil_B: Yeah, thats my goal :P
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/internet-memes-michael-snot-cera.jpg
/me Whistles out for Bronysith
Ponies47: whactu wan?
oni_link:I didn't know I could do that. thanks
Lil_B: As soon as I saw that it was from the SP game, I knew exactly what you were talking about :D
[09:29:05] <Bronysith> Ponies47: you just lost... <- What do you mean I just lost?
00,02and now i Actually go to bed
00,02gnight
oni_link but you can't really work with something like this on a programm like LMMS unless there is a really good VST Plugin
Night Phase4
Ponies47: you mentioned the game
String_Shredder: Yeah, no problem :)
sleep well Phase4
Night Phase4
Night Phase4 :)
Bronysith: O_O Yeah. I'm addicted
night Phase4
Lil_B: Which ones do you use?
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-dey-took-ur-gravity.gif
for this song I used a a normal Tripple Oscellator and made simple Squere-Waves (the slideing thing was Saw-Wave), the Drums and stuff I had from a big Sample Archiev I found (I think they are C64 Samples XD)
god. the princess molestia fanfic is really good...
oni_link LMMS has a preinstalled Gameboy Plugin and C64 Plugin, I found a very good NES Plugin, but if you want to play around with the Wave you can't do that :/
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/pokmon-pokmemes-mewtwo-is-deep.png um. wow, this quote is just.... WOW
Bronysith: sad but true
Lil_B: C64 and Amiga Stuff is the best! I want to get good at C64 chiptunes soo bad, its hella complicated compared to what I'm doing now. And Gameboy tunes are easier IMO, except for the Noise manipulation.
String_Shredder: how is it sad?
Bronysith: We like the molestia fan fic
String_Shredder: oooh. i thought u were talking about the link i posted
That mewtwo quote is inspiring
it is very true oni_link
People who think they should get better perks because of whom they are born to, are scum
i dont care who your dad is, who your grandad was etc, what color, beliefs you have, I CARE WHAT YOU DO
Bronysith: judge them on their merits and not their background, very well put
So true...
Lil_B: This is my goal for C64 stuff. This guy is a madman when it comes to arpeggios http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XwIRiJWixw
oni_link: like one time, at school. there was a chair so i walked to it, and a girl ran from across the room and i said "Hey i got here first" "So? IM A GIRL!"
/me Sits on oni_link 's head
that just made me lose more faith in humanity
oni_link: Razor 1911 ... yeah, this guy is amazing :P
Bronysith: I know, that makes me so pissed off when people make themselves off better than everyone.
oni_link I'm still experimenting with Apperigios, they still doesn't sound right to me when I make them
/me wonders why Ponies47 is on his head but doesnt mind
:D
oni_link: thats why i can barely stand code geass. SEeing the way people treat the japanese
gawdammit
hey everypony, what's the haps? :)
hey BronyInstrumental :)
oni_link: this year was my last year of high school, and all the seniors were assholes to others and such. When i was talking to 9th graders and such, (most my friends are younger than me) the teacher said that I should be acting like the other seniors and talking with them
/me Gets off of oni_link 's head
/me pokes Ponies47 .... Change your nick :p
oni_link: "Oh okay, you want me to be a sexist, immature asshole whom makes fun of others and makes threats"
Lil_B: If theres one thing that still troubles me, its arps :D I never know when to use them. And one thing I've always wanted to ask a chiptune artist is, are they neccessary?
ponibas: But I like being be called Ponies47 ;'(
:'(
no smiley spam :p
Ohai BronyInstrumental
ponibas: To be fair he does have a bit creative name, Compared to some >_>
ponibas: Typo
/me misses Ponies47 being on his head
how you doing BronyInstrumental
i'm good alexxm
oni_link in my opinion: they do sound awesome, but you can make a song without them :)
oni_link: It's ok. :3
Bronysith: I never got the point of seniority at school either :/
killerpony7733, i know.. i keep thinking i shuold /nick pony_8675309
oni_link: i mean, the TEACHER told me to act like how a senior should act. I just went on an ANDREW RYAN speech to her
Bronysith: I don't think that was right of her honestly.
ponibas: I mean't both that and those people that use a direct name of something or someone from MLP FIM
oni_link: explaining how i choose to hang out with people whom are intelligent and actual nice people
Lil_B: well now i know that Im not crazy for having that mentallity :D
Bronysith: hence you hang here :D
oh i know... the "omg there are X number of variations of RD (or other character)" have benn numerous here
oni_link: she basically said this "I see your friends are underclassmen, you should not be hanging out with your friends, why dont you go hang out with assholes whom are very immature and make fun of you"
oni_link and I just found out why I can't make good apprigios XD, LMMS can't make appridgios with less than 25ms between the notes :?
:P *
and in fact the /nick I said is actually a joke.. but it's an older song
Bronysith: You should be able to hang out with people you can benefit from being with. I think having friends you can grow off of and benefit from being around is what matters, age is a number IMO
also that teacher is really narrow minded
luckily there ARE ways around that >: D
Lil_B: oh wow. so maybe you can work around that by making a song in a faster BPM/ tempo?
and hi hoof for liking Razor1911 /) LD
:D
oni_link: yes. also, when she told me to act like a senior i said "What is a senior and how do i act like it? You want me to be sexist perverted asshole? how about pride? Should i think that i am better than everyone else because of my age?"
oni_link: "Oh and pot. should i smoke pot and come to school high as well"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ogvtoEnDxk&feature=related <- YOUR FACE! :P
oni_link no, when it displays the time in ms its static , I can link it to the beat with 1/8 1/16 and 1/32 for example, but even that when the BPM gets higher it will stop at 25ms :/
brb
oni_link but some Plugins have Inbuild appretios :D, /)
(\ *
Bronysith: Thats todays youth in a nutshell. Not all of them, mind you but the ones who stay in that herd mentality. I don't think someone is better than us simply because of their age. Thats absurd.
oni_link: exactly! I choose to act differently then the common 18 year old. I am a man
Lil_B: ouch :P maybe you shoud get used to trackers :D
no offense
but at 18 your not a man
Chrysalis: *you're
18 is way too impulsive an age
oni_link for Chiptunes... yes, But I'm making other music too :P
but i was reflecting on andrew ryan, on how a man chooses and a slave obeys
well, unless youv already moved otu
out*
Chrysalis: I think that is debateable. I know 18 year olds that are more capable and mature then most people in my age group who act like they are still in high school.
i am not a man yet, i can accept that
i liked the asterix movie last night
but calling the idiots in my senior class more manly than me just really pissed me off
Lil_B: For other music, you should look into FL Studio IMO
alexxm: me too!
oh yeah there are some 18 year olds who are incredibly mature, but they are the exception
alexxm: Me too :$
Chrysalis: glad we can agree on that :)
i regret not reading the asterix books now
age is not always an accurate measurement of maturity, I've met people my age and older who are incredibly immature, as well as people much younger than me whom I've been able to have intelligent conversations with
Chrysalis: I'm 26 and I look and act like a silly kid :D
Hrafn: my point exactly
unfortunately this generation seems to have a big something for nothing culture
oni_link I already did, but FL Studio confused me a lot, I may try Ableton or even Qubase later
oh yeah, im 22 and havnt really changed much
Hrafn: thats exactly what i mean! the 9th graders were much more mature than the seniors
I hear that Ableton is good Lil_B
O.o
Chrysalis: I still don't act like an asshole
i regret not reading the asterix books now
Back
what have you been up to Ponies47
MadSurge: you just like to have fun is what Im getting :P
lol
yeah, age has no effect on how someone acts in general, there either a nice person, or an asshole
Welcome back Ponies47
oni_link: totally
Hey Ponies47!
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-exams.jpg
people who blame it on "its a phase" generally have no idea what there doing
MadSurge: Im a goof too but when i have to i can be serious and focused
alexxm: Nothing much
oni_link oh, another think I don't like about LMMS... it crashes when you even think about using other Plugins... and I use a lot of other Plugins, I must save often
Chrysalis: Most of this generation isnt goal oriented.
Derpdash: Thank you
Ohai MadSurge :3
nope, we are living in a generation that wants everything but to do something
dam MadSurges :§
Ponies47: No problem!
Lil_B: :D wut
Lil_B: like my old computer teacher used to say : SESO! (save early, save often) :D
oni_link the old Sierra Adventure game method
I figure I'm mature enough to be responsible, but I hate seeing myself as an adult :P
Chrysalis: material world mentality
oni_link: kinda like old adventure games :D
oni_link not really
you can live in a material world and have a good mindset
if your willing to work for it you can achieve anything
but you get too damn much nowadays for doing nothing
yup :/
Sad but true :(
Chrysalis: yeah, i take that back because even then, you have goals. but nowadays people lack ambition and ask for everthing without giving
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/fanart-cosplay-fandom-base-watch-out-guys-weve-got-a-doctor-over-here.jpg
its a mindset of the people
MadSurge: lmao yep :D
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-untitled8.png
the whole coorporation thing is also funny to watch, cause its always people wanting the coorporations to give money back
Chrysalis: *Corporations
which when you break it down is "oi, you work hard and get rewarded, i want some of that without doing anythign"
oni_link do you have a song from you uploaded somewhere?
i have abysmal spelling, i know this :P
Bronysith: not lying, I would be worried if I saw that on the highway :D
Sorry dude ;4
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-ill-drink-to-that.jpg

Lil_B: (\ whoo

IM HUNGRY http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-dont-be-square1.png
Bronysith: Then go get some food! :D
Bronysith: I see what you did there!
I'm hungry too, but too lazy to get anything to eat ._.
must...devour...image...
/me has M&M
THE ZOMBIES ARE COMING. thank you bath salts
That cake sure does look good...
I only had Celestia's favorite food breakfest today :P
*food for breakfest today
Me and my derps -_-
oni_link and thanks for making Version of my childhood song (the Links Awakening song) T.T
bath salts make people act very much the same way I do when I haven't had any caffeine
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-dethroned-by-its-own-fan-fiction.jpg
Lil_B: it was my pleasure, that song was burned into my brain back when i was a kid and i had to do it :D
Bronysith: what's so bad about that book? I keep hearing about it
oni_link I need to make a remix of something from that game... I have tons of MIDIs to make remixes anyway XD
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/rage-comics-rage-comics-katmari-gagacy.png
Lil_B: Im also working on some more stuff, I just need to record but Ive been putting it off for so long :D
Lil_B: and ooh i want to see
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-never-change.jpg
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-untitled7.png i want to murder lil wayne
Bronysith: I'm like that too :D
what do you want to see oni_link ?
Oh god, Lil Wayne...
Lil_B: Well what are my choices :P
?
<oni_link> Lil_B: and ooh i want to see
WhatPayne: wait what?
tab derp, sorryyy!!
Lil_B: wait what?
FUND IT http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-lets-flip-the-switch.jpg
oni_link , you wrote [17:05:19] <oni_link> Lil_B: Im also working on some more stuff, I just need to record but Ive been putting it off for so long :D[17:05:28] <oni_link> Lil_B: and ooh i want to see
Bronysith, that's a stereotype. During the Dark Ages, the Church was one of the only sources of scientific progress.
Lil_B: Oh, yeah :D I did a remix of a song from the NES Ninja Gaiden and I re did the Zelda II great temple theme from brawl. (But i didnt like the way that one came out)
oni_link oh XD
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-memes-mens-health.jpg
Lil_B: and a Tetris remix too
the Tetris one I saw, :) sounded good
Lil_B: that was a cover, I actually did a remix
:P
oni_link you should check the C64 EVrsion of Tetris
Lil_B: I must!
oni_link Oh... one more Tetris Remix for me XD I have 47 XD
Lil_B: :D thats kinda why I didnt upload it
oni_link 25min, holding the record for the longest song in a video game since 1988 (for the record, the gameboy Tetris came out 89 :) )

Lil_B: Im still listening to it but I just remembered that the Sharp x6800 is an under-rated machine, that thing had awesome sound for its time. Check out this version of Castlevania 1's "Vampire Killer" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA0pZ5WtUgk

Now I feel like playing Fallout 3
11,01Unless radiation messes with the cola.
id rather have sunset sarsparilla
OohShiny: Cool
sunset sarsparilla is root beer
wouldn't the content of the bottle mold after a certain amount of time? I KNOW the cap covering the bottle wouldnt last long - those rust eventually
while nuka cola is coca cola
Nope
08,01the joke is that Twig has been raised in a Vault

That's where the Rocket Launcher is
A gun

Ryunosuke: Woot
Ryunosuke: megusta

Drop like 2 guns
SO MANY GUNS

Ryunosuke: awwww <3
Slenderman: No links
ooops
Slenderman: stop startin
Ryunosuke: i know where that came from......... >.>
no video links
silencer?
Meow
Slenderman: no video links during stream, please
but why
its wierd
Slenderman: because those are the rules of bronystate mate
i know
Sumica: Oh oh oh it's not where i think it was
then why would you knowingly break the rules Slenderman ?
11,01Video links are considered distractions.
so you knew the rules.. and did it anyway?
becuse its a extremely good thing that needs to be spread
DUH DUH DUUUUN
what a twist
SHORTCUT achieved!
Slenderman: thats not a excuse >.>
11,01And some streamers find it rude for people to suggest other videos to look at while they're streaming.
Slenderman: imagine going into a restraunt and advertising another restraunt
lawl
Slenderman: Ppffff just some game
Bronysith, u wasted your breath
ponibas: i noticed
ponibas: acutally i didnt say anything...i typed it up
11,01And that's why you don't post video links during stream.
............... did you hold your breath while you typed?? :p
well, you shouldnt do it because its against the rules
rather than to avoid retribution
Sumica: Do you have the Punch through walls thing?
its rude to post video links during streams
Vordox hardly the most stealthy of perks
Vordox: He doesn't
slenderman got kicked?
lol
Damn, cause he could get a pracis here now
yep
Dat steam
Nittany_Discord: can i be the site torturer?
aw
soo the slenderman can be beaten
slenderman are easy to beat...weeping angels not so much
alexxm but he will be back
youtube.com/pinkpie.mov
they always do
.......
and kicked
dat kick
that...
lol
appledash6: hi slenderman
is circumventing rules... which ITSELF is bannable ;)
circumvent
youtube.com/pewdiepie
someone else
AppleDash: Is so going to get kicked for a few days
/me murders appledash6
wait
/me makes appledash6 watch star wars phantom menace 1000000 times and then g3
So, this heat wave...
ya appledash, we are going to have to formally ask you to stop before you get yourself kicked/banned :)
What is the grenade he is using?
dat crosshair
He isn't even putting up good links
it's appledash6 theres two with the almost same name
Oh gee, this part.
Bronysith: The only torture is the G3. Don't know why people bash the prequals that aren't Attack of the Clones...
Eddmario: well the prequels all suck all together
Eddmario there's always G3.5
do we need this discussion Eddmario
Oy, Sumica, is there any chance you may get the punch through wall perk?
11,01Hey, I'm a Mica!
Midichlorians, that is all
Eddmario: the prequels are like deciding between drowning in urine or water
Vordox: I don't fink he's taken any in that line
Phantom Mennace was on eo fthe better Star Wars movies, in my OPINION.
Jar jar binks :)
Cause it could get a free talent then, bah
hello ^-^
Eddmario: out of all the star wars movies...even the originals?
okay no, I have to disagree
/me twitches
Ryunsuke kill it with fire
Bronysith: It was better then Jedi...
hey TheBelgianNotBelgian how've you been
1
Fine ^^
2
the characters had no... personallity
3
Ryunosuke: hold Eddmario down
Eddmario: Indianna jones is the best start wars movie
Check map Mica
someone hold Eddmario down
In my opinion, the order from best to worst is 5, 1, 4, 3, 6, 2
00,10diffrent part of same area
thats it..
Sumica Yep
/me hoilds down Eddmario
And I REFUSE to count the second Clone Wars.
/me twitches
i mean you have liam neisson as a jedi how do you mess that up
Eddmario: there is no plot or main character in phantom menace
This is the way to the praxis, but you cannot take the mdown in stealth
Question Mark
3 of them and they won't move Mica, so ignore this part for now
there was a plot to phantom menace, but it didnt make ANY sense
Ryunosuke: even discord thought that movie was stupid
ie. the whole blockade, but no turmoil in the republic? what?
Bronysith i didn't say anything about him i was just wondering how they messed up having liam neission as a jedi
alexxm: i know
ok then Bronysith
He'll get us porn, trust him
twi_sprinkle_GS17: in the game of thrones books, tehre are 8 main characters
twi_sprinkle_GS17: but he did it right
twi_sprinkle_GS17: who do i relate to in the PoS that is phantom menace?
Beep beep
Make a save file
SAVE MICA!
Sumica: Toggle slow walk and crouch to get close to them
Bronysith: Phantom Mennace showed how Obi Wan became the tutor for Anakin. Attack of the Clones was pretty much filler while showing the origins of Stormtroopers. Revenge of the Smith showed how Vader fully came to be, the Jedi fell, and the birth of the Empire.
Bronysith: idk what pos is. and i was fine was sw1 having 3 main characters, and i dont see anything wrong about it
Sumica: Shift
lol revenge of the smith
twi_sprinkle_GS17: phantom menace had no main character
and tbh, at least ep 1, and 2, the lightsabre fights seemed... more staged as opposed to having more emotion in thier swings in 4-6
do it your way.. guards will never hear a thing!
if that made sense
DRB
what could that mean?
USE
11,01Aren't stormtroopers born in thunderstorms?
geee.. a full inventory
what a shock
Eddmario: um... in a new hope obi wan "HE was a good friend" phantom menace "I gave my word to qui gon to train anakin." Like as though obi wan never wanted to train anakin in the first place, just because qui gon told him to.
Then you have Clone Wars. the 5-minute shorts Cartoon Network aired leading up to the release of Sith were the Escape from Midnight Castle of the Star Wars series. The crappy animated movie and series that followed is the G3.5 of Star Wars.
Should have taken the inventory upgrade
Star wars discussion?
FUN FACT THERE ARE ONLY 3 STAR WARS MOVIES, A NEW HOPE, EMPIRE and JEDI
everything else is a terrible fanfic
Sumica: They will never explode when you crouch and sneak at the same time
Bronysith: now now alot of the games were just as good
Why do you need so many weapons Sumica ?
Bronysith: it doesnt Have to have a main character
Alister: Cause you need different weapons for different things in this game
twi_sprinkle_GS17: but it has no likeable characters
you were saying??
11,01GG Mica!
:P:
LOL
dxed
Bronysith: Isn't Jedi to Star Wars as Derpy Hooves in The Last Roundup to soccer moms?
Damn Barrels :|
Eddmario: what?
hai :3/
Bronysith: I've heard there's a solution to the problem of integrating the 3 old movies with the 3 new. The answer is "4, 5, 2, 3, 6"
killerpony7733: I only kept the Tranquilizer Gun and the Stun gun and I was ok
hey Derpy_Hooves how've you been
Bronysith: lol for you maybe
NullRadix: the answer is. 4, 5 ,6
Alister: Well having a good selection of weapons is good either way
Bronysith: You dislike the new movies?
get the shotgun back!
Malavolent: there are no new star wars movies. only 4, 5 ,6
get more ammo later
also, han didnt shoot first, he was the only one who shot :)
Bronysith: Take those Nostalgia Goggles off. I have actually seen all 3 of the origina trilogy YEARS before Phantom Mennace was announced, and my comment still stands.
SW3 was great.
Bronysith: That makes sense. Wait, it doesn't.
Ded kitty
Eddmario: i watched the prequels first man
Eddmario: didnt even know it was star wars
Bronysith i always found it odd they just made 3 movies but said it was the 4th 5th and 6th movies
Eddmario: then i watched the original trilogy
Eddmario: and thought the original trilogy was 10000000 times better
alexxm: its unpredented which makes it awesome
Obviously a cat
alexxm: also its a way of testing if the series coul afford prequels i think
yeah
*unprecetented
Bronysith: Of the prequals, which one is the worst?
The lightsaber fights have real conflict in the prequels. When luke fought vader for the first time you know what he feels, HEre he is, facing the man who he thought murdered his father and his teacher
Eddmario: they are all terrible
11,01Sumica's arms are 9ft long.
If you want to know what is wrong wioth the star wars prequels look up red letter media analysis of the movies
Eddmario: id rather see blood in my urine than the star wars prequels
I've seen the all the prequels in one day, I'm gonna watch the original trilogy now. Let's see, what is better.
GOT REFLEX GET BOTH
his analysis is great
Awww
/me murders Eddmario
Heres an idea, let's all watch the Hobbit
Lego Starwars i
Oh Bronysith, you have no idea what I'v got up my sleeve.
11,01Here's an idea:
is better than some of the prequels.
/me vats Eddmario with the Anti material rifle
11,01Here's another idea:
Bronysith: You missed
Nittany_Discord: Whoa, don't overdo it.
11,01Sorry.
Eddmario: i was aiming for the explosive tank right next to you
See Bronysith? Even Nittany_Discord/Maid_Discord/Nittany_Maid agrees with me
Nittany_Discord: u so silly <3
i have never seen the star wars moviez.
LAWL
Eddmario: he never said that
He's gonna die!
bonjour
11,01I didn't agree with anyone.
Bronysith: He never said he didn't either
hi RAWRity
how you doing RAWRity
ummm
LAWL
HAHAHA
afternoon RAWRity
gravity.. y u troll??
hey RAWRity
that fence is raping the body
11,01Hi RAWRity. Let me take your coat and grab you a seat.
RAWRity: Are the Star Wars prequals just as good as the original trilogy?
If he falls he dies!
i think he was already dead
11,01People die when the fall far.
People die when they're killed.
i'm making anudder of dem artz ^_^
suddenly BaconMane
hi BaconMane
Eddmario: is the mediteranean sea home to polar bears?
Vordox, doesn't matter he won't let me count gravity kills
guns dont kill people, loss of blood does
and holes
twi_sprinkle_GS17: guns dont kill people. BULLETS DO
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Ban blood.
Nittany_Discord: Not true. I've seen someone get pushed off the roof of a skyscraper, and break his back on a bench from the fall. He survived.
1 2 3 4 5!
Bronysith: thats overused.
11111!
This door's a bitch
Eddmario: the password is open
now anywho
dat hack
how hard is hacking in this game
yay!
RAWRity: um what did you say about the prequels? about polar bears in the mediterenean? that was funny
lol
Sumi, killl all the buckets!
There is no emotional conflict in the prequel lightsaber battles. Oh who is this shmuck? who cares TTIME TO DANCE
Wow never heard that one before by doing this before you are actually given the mission
Bronysith: What prequels?
lol beer add
Malavolent: THANK YOU
RAWRity: Technically, there is a species of animal that lives in the Mediteranean that's very closely related to polar bears
Bronysith: Just kidding, I like dem prequels.
Eddmario: but not polar bears
Bronysith: there were plenty of conflicts during the last two battles of SW3, but they cant be emotional all the time during battle. its caleld focus
/me crucifies Malavolent
See ya in 3 days guys.
twi_sprinkle_GS17: it was just DANCING
The proper order from best to worst is 5, 1, 4, 3, 6, 2
bye Malavolent
wtf eddmario? oO
11,011 had a horrible ending.
11,01So stupd.
Bronysith: nope.
and here we go again...
twi_sprinkle_GS17: "You betrayed us anakin. I MUST STOP YOU" time to dance
Nittany_Discord: Why?
bye Malavolent where ate you going
/me murder Eddmario to death
i've never seen any of them, so i can't pass judgement
alexxm: Oh, just getting killed and ressurected again, that kind of stuff.
11,01All of this arguing.
ok then Malavolent have fun
Bronysith: ok? sw4''youve betrayed us before darth, lets dance''
what game is this?
I sure will.
http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/demotivational-posters-human-nature.jpg
bye Malavolent
It's called a discussion :)
11,01Lol RAWRity XD
RAWRity, aye
twi_sprinkle_GS17: they didnt dance in episode 4, obi wan was weak and frail and you can see that how THATS how an actual lightsaber battle would occur
it's Human nature to defy the orders
twi_sprinkle_GS17: theres no highly choreographed bullshit in fighting
RAWRity and we're damn proud of it
that's how evolution works
Bronysith: both him and darth werent nearly as strong as two young strong jedi
very much related..if you got the time watch, otherwise watch later..very in depth analysis of the sw movies...
http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/star-wars/
a guy find something new by doing something bad
What you need?
twi_sprinkle_GS17: but there IS NO DANCING IN FIGHTING
red_ony: love those vids
Bronysith: they couldnt move around as much. in sw6 Luke did some pirhouetting
:)
Ugh my computers bein slow
You need to go back? =P
twi_sprinkle_GS17: there wasnt any stupid dance highly choreographed bullshit though
Bronysith: its called ''fiction''. there are also no blasters or magic irl
Bronysith: if people Could move like in sw3, maybe they would
Yay the stream is.. nevermind, stupid computer
Hmm, trying o remember
http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/demotivational-posters-yeah-she-threw-me-a-bone.jpg
RAWRity: Dude, that's creepy.
yay!
there are 2 kinds of people in this world. People who like high quality shows, intense plot, and lovable characters. Then there are people that like the star wars prequels
:)
What's your currectn objective, Mica?
Bronysith: no. you just always deal in extremes, its either black or white
Opinions explained by Bronysith.
Oh those are sidequests
I meant the Main mission cause that is what you just did
I found the third Star Wars prequel decent, but nowhere near as good as the old trilogy
Bronysith: truth is that sw prequels werent as good as the original, but it was still enjoyable, and sw3 was great. it doesnt outright suck
Dick Jensen,
It's THE FUTURE. No one gives a shit about lasers anymore.
the best thing about the third SW prequel movie is that Jar Jar Binks didn't have a single line :P
Bronysith: his acting didnt always make sense, Hamill wasnt perfect in sw6 either
Hrafn: he did actually
he did? I must have missed it
http://cheezburger.com/6443018240
Hrafn: he was the one who requested the senate give palpatine extra powers
inb4 takedown
dat blind guy
twi_sprinkle_GS17: wasn't that in the second movie?
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Yep, so we can agree that Jar-Jar is the worst thing that happened to the SW universe, preiod.
Hrafn: no it was third i think
RAWRity i don't remember that happening in shrek 2
I thought you would get picked up by Malik after this mission
05I jsut beat space zombies and pirates
Its been noted that you can remove Episode I and almost nothing is lost
05again
I'll be honest Ewooks were pretty bad too...
SirGanjalf: i cant actually
05now what...
And transported to the real next mission
or howevr you write them
Bornysith, what about the Clone Wars cartoon? Not the CGI cartoon, but the 2D one made by Genndy Tartakovsky (The one with the cool verison of General Grevious)
I'm confused
SirGanjalf: hes purpose was to be annoying, and he was, he fulfilled his purpose. yeah he wasnt a very good char, but ive seen worse
lol Hayden looked so awkward in the new sw6 version
newish*
he looked awkward in everything
Oh, Mica
because he's a terrible actor.
You're supposed to head towards the Police station I think
If it's the neural hub thing
dem sneaking skills
i actually think Hayden really enjoyed being there
RAWRity: what about gunganas?
Allo everypony.
so he had to wear stilts to fit in the suit
hey Meanwhile how've you been
RAWRity: or *gulps* midochlorians? *pukes
ello Meanwhile
Bronysith: still nowhere near as bas as "From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!"
oh, and "Only the sith deal in absolutes."
alexxm: Amusing myself with Bioshock. Funny stuff in that game. How about you?
RAWRity: says the guy who just killed children
RAWRity: i loled at the terrible writing of that part man
i'm good Meanwhile what funny stuff did you find
Bronysith: "He's killing younglings!"
can you heard me n*ack*
Bronysith: "I love the water."
alexxm: Well, freezing someone solid and then shattering them to bits with a wrench is always funny, am I right?
I'm not as strategic as you wrek, If I were playing this game I would die in the very first minutes, because If there is guns, I act like Rambo
yep Meanwhile
RAWRity: i dont like sand
Bronysith: his head was kinda screwed bythe emperor by that point, he was just ignoring his mind
Hey everypony! Im back from my muffin run!
twi_sprinkle_GS17: horrible writing
sup Derpdash
ouch
how'd that go Derpdash
Bronysith: nope.
Punch.
poor old black guy
"It's over Anakin! I have the high ground!"
hey OohShiny
RAWRity: hey remember when maul had the high ground?
You underestimate my prententiousness RAWRity.
I got 4 blueberry muffins while i was gone :P
the high ground grants a +5 attack bonus!
too much star wars in this chat
If I was beside you I could be your walkthrough
:D
Hrafn: then why did maul get killed? he had the high ground
boom head shot
well, uh... plothole, I guess :P
OohShiny should we save this for tomorrow night when we're actually watching Star Wars?
yup
Even if we're not watching the Star Wars you're talking about. :P
I won't anyway :/
I need to sleep early because I study all day long
Sumica: Unconcious butt fun?
Meanwhile: sounds fun
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Maybe, but i don't think that "annoying to the rest of a characters" must equal "annoying to the audience".
sounds fun butt fun
Well even though it's just the OT you can bet there's probably going to be your usual "OT vs. prequels" thing going on
Sumica: Dead, but fun.
Lawl
death by snu snu?
Dead butt fun
RAWRity: nice
that looks wrong
SirGanjalf: i didnt find him that annoying
ooh
i think my chat derped reopening it

Pffy.

Howdy Allegr0.
Bronysith: It's a personal preference again. But i could agree that there weren't near as bad as Jar-Jar:)
Bronysith: Actually, yes.
SirGanjalf: /me shudders
nothing is as bad as Jar Jar :P
SirGanjalf: that is just dog doodie
Hrafn: id rather see blood in my urine then see jar jar
You why it's annoying to fight against Oddjob in Goldeneye multiplayer? Probably the same reason that made the Ewoks so hard to gun down.

Speaking about Oddjob; it baffles me why Valve dind't ad a hat that is a weapon to tf2, yet

Everlasting_Joy: Are you telling me you could miss the Statue of Liberty if it was dark out?
BronyInstrumental: oops, sorry wrong nick:)
:P
Bronysith: This fits Conspiracy Keanu even more
RAWRity: lol
Meanwhile: To be fiar, I haven't been to NYC, let alone NYC during a black out. What I was implaying was, if the Statue was a weeping angel, and a complete black out occured in NYC, it should be able to move then.
*fair.
Everlasting_Joy: I think someone would notice if the Statue of Liberty suddenly /moved/

Bronysith: It wasn't driven into the ground. It was driven into the ground, dug a grave, drilled into said grave, buried, stomped on, and then just to finish it off, a monument was put over it which sunk it even further into the ground.
11,01Kandarihu: 3 days and 4 hours left on that bid.
Ah, okay.
Everlasting_Joy: ikr
Everlasting_Joy: And the ground around it was salted so that nothing could ever grow there.
Mica: The antenna is located at the far end of this terrace. Hack a level one computer to shut it down. Once it is shut down, Malik will arrive to extract you.

After bringing the neural hub to your apartment, Malik is told to pick you up and bring you to Highland Park, but will not meet you at your apartment's helipad, instead asking you to go to the helipad next to the transmitter.
This is what it says in the FAQ

Bronysith: What angers me about it is how over used it is.

Ah yes, using the music to indicate danger, a staple of video games.
BronyInstrumental: Well, what're we watching Sumic do? Because it isn't "making his lunch."
I honestly do not know if this is it
Stop right there criminal scum, you have violated the law! Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence!

shana, it's a function of any IRC client to parse that text the way it does. It's how channel names are represented, and it's how people in one channel can point people to another channel.
so, got the first 4 eps of Serial Experiments Lain on DVD from my local used book store. Was gonna get the next three, but they'd mislayed the disc somewhere.
wow
I've wanted to get the series forever
I'm taking an old fashioned antidote. It's suppose to help me concentrate better so I can cram for my Physics test.
It's called a shot of vodka and some red bull.
serial experiments lain dvds are out of print, waren't they?
um. anypony want to play dead island on pc later? im downloading it now
/me only has dead island on xbox
Kandarihu: not all irc clients parse messages for channel names, you can join channels using /join <name> - channel names are short enough to type, not necessarly to clobber the ui with links
I fell asleep about an hour ago, just woke up with my headphones still on
What clients don't do that?
s/necessarly/necessary
#Shana
/me eats banarsss
Lol
dont advertise other rooms

AttacktheAndalite: Nah im jk
AttacktheAndalite: no im not
