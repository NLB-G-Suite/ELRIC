"You should have taken the time to build a mech foal!"
9jus' sayin', it's everything wrong with the industry
/me 0charges at Denied_Existence, spinning and flipping in the air, the blade on the chain flying in all directions. Finally, he does a huge flip, the chain coming from behind, over his head, and toward Denied_existence. "I DON'T NEED A MECH!"
9same with Naruto

/me and his mech are flung a kilometer backwards!
9kay, bye
0"GET BACK HERE!"

/me 0is struggling to get up
9It was a great series right until it went to Rescue Rukia
0NewDCD whaaaaaaa

Polarfire i save EVERYTHING
9huh
9well
4Sorry, my net went stupid
just in case of epicness
9that's an error I did not expect
9gimme a sec
4CHATCEPTION
4A small taste of what's to come tomorrow?
dun dun duunnnnnnn
9there we go
9sorry for the inconvenience
04bbl or bye
/me is happy to see exploding robot dinosaurs again :P
9give me amoment
9I'd like to fix the quality
s'all good bro
not sure if you got it Ghosties - you're The Guy Who Dies At the Start: http://pastebin.com/5K1v40q0
9fixed
9stream is now live
Nya
4OH
4Now I remember
4I logged in real quick to see what was going on
4And said that
4Now I remember
wait what is that story GGgala?
4It occurred this past Monday night when I logged into Brony State really late
wait...
does that robot have a gun for it's epeen?
9nah
4I said "There's a red spy in Brony Stat (minus the e, because I wasn't paying attention)" and it spawned a RP
9it's not a robot, and that's not a gun
night everyone. Polarfire. we're going to meet up during BMN tomorrow, between 7-8 EST. I'll get your character sheet finished with you, and you can join us all. we probably won't play due to sexy movie time, but we can talk and discuss a pony game .night all
O_o
Ok sounds great. Thanks Silver
yup pretty much ghosties. :D too bad you didn't stick around. It was pretty great
4I did my part, then you all did yours
lol yup :)
the Dead Guy role is a very important role
^
in retrospect i like the part where we extrapolated a plot point from the chat-equivalent of an animation error
dynamic kill?
that bitch just exploded
lol...I have no idea how these mechanics work
but damn it those explosion scenes are entertaining
9Dynamic Kills are when the "death" explosions are part of the enemy's attack animation instead of their own standard, standoalone animation...like just now.
nice
who?
wait...that's not viewtiful!
9he means GodMars
9yeah, he just combined into the bigass robot he's supposed to be
nooooooooo!
poor Viewtiful...he lived such a great life
9technically he can de-dock?
dat dodge animation
lol
eeyup
BELLY BUTTON LAZ0R
ohai fffffffffffffffffff
I wanna see another one of those big dramatic scenes where there's like 20 people and the captain or whatever screams something at them
and then que giant beam of friendship
/me prefers the more mechlike mechs like this one.
9The Macross F isn't the battleship for this route
9so yeah
wait...
Macross
welp, he left.
as in ROBOTECH?
9more mechlike mechs are considered "Real Robots", who are often some sort of military hardware
I LOVED THAT SHOW WHEN I WAS A KID
lol fffffffffffffffffff
9Super Robots, like Gurren Lagann, are...yeah, Macross F
9but the Valkyries/Veritechs of the F SUCK in this game
9so I don't use them
yeah. I prefer the real robots
by like a mile.
9I love both
I liked the veritechs :(
9some Supers have much crazier attacks though
9and that is fun
the original Robotech was so wonderful
9techincally, the original MACROSS
9the Macekreisms of the show were the bad thing about Robotech
9have you watched Macross: Do You Remember Love?
don't think so
9Go watch it
9go watch it right now
but but...exploding robot dinosaurs!
9dude, Do You Remember Love is an alternate telling of the events of the first series
9coupled with BEAUTIFUL ANIMATION and much better pilot suit designs
hmmm
9actually, according to Macross Canon
9neither series are "canon" tellings of what happened during the first Space War
9basically, both the TV show and movie are different "documentaries" of the same events
interesting
but I think we can all agree that the Russian Captain was by far the sexiest character :P
so the shows are both told by an unreliable narrator?
s/narrator/animator-producer-etc/
9somewhat. More like "inexactitudes of history"
9also, watched Macross Plus?
Mew
9DAT DYNAMIC KILL
I haven't seen anything of the series outside of what I watched as a kid
nope, DCD
9well
9there's your homework
wasn't dynamic
lol
9it was
what? We saw him blow up normal at the end
it's 3 weeks before I go back to college, and I already have homework :P
9The "BEING DRAGGED AND EXPLODING" part of the animation is reserved for dynamic kills
ah
9it just doesn't end like a dynamic kill should, that's all
9but basically any piece of animation reserved for when the attack lands a kill = dynamic kill
anyone ever play that PS2 Game Robotech Battlecry?
9that's probably a better explanation, isn't it?
yeah
lol
that sounded like they said "gokaiger"
stream interrupt for anyone else?
nope
ah. it keeps happening to me
man...why doesn't Japan port these games in English?
I would totally buy it if it were translated
9Val: because so many animus = HUGE LICENSING COSTS OH GOD
9as well as niche fanbase
9basically
9as awesome as it is
9it wouldn't sell enough
9to warrant it considering the costs
yeah but, I know next to nothing about this series/universe, yet I'd buy this game based on the gameplay I've seen
how does it sell in Japan then?
any fandub?
9they have actually brought a few of these, though....the Original Generations ones, that is
and I'd bet there's a larger audience than they expect
9Gala: like hotcakes
9Dermathil: a few are fan translated. SRW J for GBA and SRW Alpha for PSOne
9I'd recommend starting with J
9there are many SRW games translation projects because this series is very popular
yeah...so I'm required to take a foreign language as a major requirement...I'm taking Japanese so I can play these damn games
>MFW Gba game
DO WANT
9give me a moment
Theres this mech game where you could customize and fight in an arena
it was on gamecube
Mechwarrior?
I cant remeber the game
oh, Gamecube
no
9http://www.mediafire.com/?r9bbh3n8d7bb7sn Patched and uploaded by yours truly
Mechwarrior was an old PC game :P
:DDD
THANKS DCD
normally I'd say something about copyright infringement
/me needs a GBA emulator
but suddenly I don't care
9also
Virtual GBA is good
9play at 2x or 3x size with the corresponding HQ Filter
9for prettier graphics
alright
oh damn it
9also brace for awesome plot
my gba emulator is on my other computer
grrrr
lolol
9because SRWs are always great on plot
9too bad we can't understand most of it
dat plot
someone needs to fandub this game
9Fun DCD Trivia: SEED Destiny was a terrible series. However, how SRW Z handled it was SO GOOD, that most people take its version of the events as the canon one. This makes the talentless hack of a director buttfrustrated to no end.
lol
lolololol
is there also a PS1 emulator while we're at it?
9ePSXe
Epsxe
9or a PSP
awww
whore :P
I ain't got no PS console
9you're looking for "Super Robot Wars Alpha Gaiden" btw
9also guys
ever only got nintendos
9that's it for me tonight
awwwwww
9night, everypony
DAAAAW
gnight DCD
9I might stream some more in the preshow
night DCD
!espeon
thanks for streaming
9it's late, and got to get tomorrow's movies
night
:(
BRING ME MY SOCK PUPPETS TOMORROW
OR ELSE
great stream
>MFW they want me to pay for an emulator
(VGBA)
lolling forever
what...?
9Dermathil
9just grab VirtualBoyAdvance
VGBA is free....
12.
12boo
oh
Val, not where I was linked
VBA*
not VBGA
that's why
night DCD :) thanks for the stream bro
9WHORING ONESELF TIME
O_o
streamception? streamception
AHAHAHA
9If you liked this stream and like shit with explosions and manlyness
9and like ponies as well
9please read my fic, "Kamen Rider Wyburn"
9this was a paid political advertisement
OH GOD
OH GOD WHY?
CARAMEL?
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?
<3
paid for by the "NewDCD's future 6-stars rating council"?
02*WB03(Drake03)02WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
12dwakkkkkkkkke
NewDCD doesn't bookmark EQ, like a baws
04Boo muthafuggas
Wait, how do I install the emulator from the .zip?
04BREEEE
04It's good to be back
it's just an exe
no installing
12yes it is
12hi
well from where I dl
whoo Antipodes update
it was in .zip
yes GGgala
03watch your language
9technically I got a story with 6 stars
9but it's not Wyburn
9Wyburn is rated pretty low...I think there were some people that downgraded stories labeled "Grimdark" going around at the time though
yeah that was weird..
9because this was around the time when everyone flipped their shit due to Cupcakes...I THINK.
9might be mixing up the events
9but I'm pretty sure I got some random "1" votes
in mid-march?
12.......
12where is Aurora's mod
i thought Cupcakes was older
9lemme see...
12hiding
it was something like a week or so before party of one
cupcakes that is
>mfw i'm unsurprised at saddlesore fanfic police
9yeah, March
9let me check when did Party of One got released...
04I'm just happy I'm back
04so
04boo
12that's my line
late april
How do I put HD settings on the GBA emulator?
second-to-last episode, finale was beginning of may, so
delete system 32
9April...hmm
clopfic reading time?
9Dermathil: There should be a "window size" option around
yesssssssssssssssss
9choose the multiplier
All of my money
9then find the "filters"
9and select the one matching the size you changed your window to
9otherwise it will look terrible
gasp
you ez torrenting inception
9but yeah
for shame :P
9I think it was around the time
9oh look
9I forgot to turn off the stream
9well
9as I said
9I'm poor
lol
I've got nothing against pirating from the people who made Inception :P
You mean you don't legally acquire all the movies for movie night?! :O
okay, cupcakes was posted to EqD on Feb 24th, and the post implied it had been around a while
My whole worlds has been shattered!
Feb 24th really? wow
I... I thought you were better than that NewDCD! :(
>I hate the Inception haters. The movie is good if you watch it again!
If you watch it again it makes more sense!
>the movie is shit if you watch it again* fixed :P
you misunderstand
i have no feelings on inception whatsoever
GRRRR
I don't hate it because I don't understand it
and i watched it twice
I hate it because it's a farce trying to be artistic and deep
when in reality it's just a waste of money
i can go either way. i can't decide if it's lulz in a good way or a bad way
It is still way better than most blockbusters out there (TRANSFORMERS)
Anything is better than transfomers.
(all the shitty romance movies)
well saying a polished turd is better than a turd isn't much
it's still a turd
heh...that was a quote from one of my teachers actually
What if that turd is a really shiny polished sphere?
it's extremely retro scifi -- almost no characterization next to a mountain of world-building
>mfw you'll be insulting The Dark Knight next
it's still a turd
why would I hate Dark Knight?
The Dark Knight is overrated.
He made both movies
so?
Inception was his idea
Spielburg made Jurassic Park...he also made Indiana Jones 4
4Hey!
4The Dark Knight was a great movie
4Shut up
I never said it was bad, just that it was overrated.
4overrated implies it's not as good as it's made out to be
4Which is negative
^^
4which = bad
It's not the second coming of cinema jesus that people made it out to be.
/me giggles at the Ghosties
Ghosties, wanna use the lawnchair?
ung...
:/
(I can lend it to you for Violet's case)
BDSM Jesus?
4Look, I'm not saying Dark Knight IS THE BEST MOVIE EVAR but it's really one of the best hero movies created
What do I have to do with Lawn Chairs?
I would certainly say it's the best of the comic book hero movies
Dark Knight is a great movie. . .
and Dark Knight Rises is going to be cool~
4Eh
4Don't get me started on DKR
I'm assuming that's the planned sequel for it?
@ValtheJean You sure you don't want to watch Elektra with me? ;D
4Why Nolan couldn't just sign Depp on to do The Riddler is beyond me
Val, that's the ANNOUNCED sequel
not just planned.
Because Depp is too busy with Tim Burton o.o
@VioletVanilla wait...what?
Elektra?
Elektra? sure is troll in here
4Depp wanted to do Riddler last I recall
4But oh well
Elektra = WORST comic book hero movie ever according to everyone. . .
9I am of the opinion we gotta watch something before we get an opinion on stuff
oh...I thought you were being serious
/me gives a cookie to GGgala
didn't notice the ";D"
Oh well, if you want to come over that's fine too. . .
I just made fresh cookies
What is this "watch stuff before you judge it" bullshit?! This is the internet! We don't do that around here!
omnom
Though I have work in a couple of hours so you better hurry! ;3
@Dashite: Exactly.
but then other people will be like "if you hate it so much why are you watching it"!
@GGgala: Double exactly!
Forever ashamed if you watch something stupid. . .
and then the "it's not FOR you" crowd will join in...
XD
AAAAAH! Oh, I'm talking to myself. Nice.
YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND, IT'S AN ACQUIRED TASTE
maybe, but my point of view is right ;)
"you're too elitist/not elite enough to enjoy it!"
what do you mean where's my mod
9WELP
I imagined gary's mod there
lol
9Seems I'll have to draw a picture for Wyburn's next update
12i thought Aurora had op
04o-o
Oh. Hi, Aurora.
/me talks about Aurora in 3rd person for the fun of it
:3 I wanna see pishure~
Yay! I'm not talking to myself anymore!
>MFW I discover all the mech pilots are teens and not professional adults.
9well
Who still got school
9I have some working designs here...
9Dermathil: not all of them
School is over yo.
>excused from school forever for saving the world
Beginning the first mission of J
04Are you new?
EVERYTHING I SEE ARE STUDENTS RAAAG
Who here thinks Spongebob is stupid and evil?
9oh
9that
04Just out of curiosity, since I've never seen your name here.
9LOL
04BLASPHEMY
04SACRILEGE
oh man
Oh, I am new.
04I DECLARE HOLY WAR AGAINST YOU AND YOUR KIND
all of this robot fighting and whatnot
/me has no idea what he is doing in that game
04WE ARE AT WAAAAAAAR
we should totally get a BMN stream of a Supreme Commander battle royale
04*ahem* No I don't think it's stupid and evil.
O:
SUPREME COMMANDER
But Spongebob is a freaky little dude. *shivers at the thought of him*
I WILL GO AGAINST YOU ALL
I'll just be in my little corner down here.
>Mfw Total Annihilation should be better
lol
Or the free remake
04It's extremely childish and the humour could use some work here and there, but it's still an amusing show and there is a reason it's such a juggernaut for Nickelodeon's ratings.
I'm totally not building anything!
hey, Total Annihilation was a solid game
Anyone have Command and Conquers? ;D
bree
/me hides his under construction Mavor
I haven't been admin for months..
Ever been to Nickalodeon resorts?
12nick doesn't really have anythings
VioletVanilla, only all of them.
I gave it up remember?
12no i don't
Wait, that's not true.
@DASHITE I CHALLENGE YOU TO A COMP STOMP
04No I haven't
I ain't saying anything against TA.
I don't have Sole Survivor.
I LOVE TA.
04hi
There's even a free remake out there somewhere.
I WILL SHOW YOU HOW A WOMAN HANDLES MICROMANAGEMENT
12if that counts
angry much?
called Spring
well, Nickalodeon has people dressed up as Dora walking around, and Dora is EVIL!
Total Annihilation is alright. . .
:p
12i did not see that
lol
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_%28game_engine%29
why bother a remake of TA? It has several mods plus Supreme Commander is an unofficial sequel
Dark Reighn bitches!
04Take care what you call 'evil'
It's very outdated though. . .
Gah, Dark Reign.
ValtheJean: well, updated engines, etc?
I think it still holds
12nothing is evil
^ As ValtheJean said
12not even justin bieber and rebecca black
I mean, the modding community for TA is STILL going
Ever seen the video called "Dora the Murderer"?
Well, that's not saying too much. . .
it's still a very strong community
The modding community for Half Life is still going. . .
and that's like. . .
The modding community for the original DOOM is still going stong. . . x.x
the modding community for half life pales in comparison to the TA
yeah.
Just look up Complete Annihilation or Balanced Annihilation for idea.
Dude, I just had a weird thought about a Shadow Lugia. It has a red horn and is creepy.
hey DCD that looks pretty good
>suddenly has immense amounts of nostalgia
one of these days i gotta get Half-Life so i can play the mod /Natural Selection/
04brb installing AoM
tis a good mod
Natural Selection
which i've heard such great things about
Very good mod
9the designs in the right are working designs for Kamen Rider Spike
9so yeah
Terrible players
x.x
Watch it. It's pretty rediculous. (I spelled that wrong, didn't I?)
lol
fair enough
Synergy was a really fun HL2 mod...for a while at least
I played it about three weeks ago. . .
DCD that's awesome :D
isn't there a half-life mod where you seem to be playing someone who's locked up in a hospital hallucinating the zombies?
GGgala: Probably. . .
XD
AIR RAID SIREN
I wouldn't be surprised
(in the gba port)
04Ridiculous*
Okay, that creepy Shadow Lugia just keeps popping up in my head...*shivers*
you know, WC3 had a really good modding community
@Dashite Where you go? ):
it's a shame blizzard killed the universe with WoW
x.x
Thanks, Drake.
WC3
04A shadow lugia with a red horn? Is the horn on the back of it's head or on it's snout?
then again
I'm right here.
WAS MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD RTS aside from C&C and Starcraft
DotA killed everything that was good about WC3
My cat is going beserks.
stupid fucking DotA
ValtheJean: true story~
I wish it had never been made...
I never got into WC3.
i'm back from being afk ;o
I hated the heroes.
it was a pretty solid game
I can understand that
personally I liked it because it was just a more organized micro management
@Dashite Check PM's mister! D<
who the hell is Ja-Mu?
It was a good blend is what it was. . .
04wb
thanks
It blended micromanagement but wasn't like
Starcraft levels? :P
UNIVERSE AT WAR
Well, that too. . .
I played Starcraft for the melee games, I played Warcraft III for the custom maps and the story
unfortunately...it seems that only Starcraft has kept the story part
here's to hoping the next Starcraft game isn't an MMO
Starcraft 2. . .
<3
AND THEN
EVERYPONY CAME
(aha! I was thinking of the Half-Life mod /They Hunger/)
I was very pleased with SC2
they really improved on their storytelling with it
They Hunger has a few servers still up, it's a decent mod! GGgala
Eh...
Story in SC2 was...
And the music made me cream rainbows~
notice I said "improved" not "amazing" :P
:P
actually im making a YT video for an MSR remix i made
i'm gonna start playing sc2 next week, so i'm still in spoilers lockdown
12silly radio hosts
It was too game-y. They were more focused on creating missions to teach you how to use all the units.
TUTORIAL TOWER
yeah, even tho this is a SEGA song, im playing it as a preshow track tomorrow
15 missions of Tutorials
again, it was improved
because usually for preshow songs, i play any game song i want ;p
12do a remix of an ozzy song
the Starcraft I story telling was awful
12mix it wwith some nintendo song
with the same like...2 missions over and over again
AAAAH! THAT FREAKY SHADOW LUGIA JUST APPEARED ON MY SCREEN!
LOL
Ozzy + Ninty = o-o
sure, it was excusable with WC2, because that was cutting edge at the time
What? You mean kill everything?
6Hey bree guess what?
That's not a story issue, that's a mission design issue.
12?
6I BROKE YOUR STUPID CRAP.
/me 6BOINK
you mean survive/kill all enemy buildings?
BREAST FIRE
12????
03Oh
03my
03god
03I am so scarred for life
your complaint was that the missions were too focused on teaching new units...
6o.o?
03there was this weird bug flying around
but there's also: escort, make it through this maze
03looked like a fly mixed with an earwig
03grossest thing I've ever seen
03well
x.x Bad Images
03it would fly around a bit then vanish
12can't earwigs fly?
03so I couldn't use my bugzapper to kill it
reach this flag and then defend it
03after a while
Yeah, every mission in SC2 boiled down to spam the new unit till you win.
03it starts flying and landing on my arms, legs, all over my body
Dude, I had to log back in because of that freaky Shadow Lugia. IT JUST APPEARED ON MY COMPUTER SCREEN! Oh, wb, Aurora.
03I am so freaked out
03eventually I sucked it up with the vacuum but x__________-x
12lock your door drf
lol
/me isn't sure what ValtheJean meant by same 2 missions over and over
you spammed goliaths on the terrazine mission?
12curl up in bed with the blanket toppled over you
03nop
03-p
12i think i might do the same because my confusion of Aurora has me so confused
03LL and I still need to Video Kinect later :P
I did make a fair number of them.
Dude, that Shadow Lugia is FREAKING ME OUT!
6wat
12ewwwwwww wkinect
04AoM is working heckyes
Probably more than anything else.
well I prefer a long tutorial over fighting the same thing over and over again with the same strategy
12what do you mean broke my stuff
at least there's a feeling of progress and learning
BREAST FIRE
12or were you just pulling my tail
*looks out window and screams* iiit's outside the window!!!:s
My cat really doesn't like that FREAKY SHADOW LUGIA!
breasts fire?
(playing the game for gba that DCd linked)
welp, I think I'm going to call it a night
Like I said, it has a red horn on its snout and red spines in betwen it's white ones!:s
g'night gents
Night.
CRITICAL
good night
night val
Awwww, nighty night Val~
Sorry about that.
12o_O
ROCKET PUNCH
12close one of the windows
Oh, Shadow was me and that Shadow Lugia popped up on my screen.

Who here has seen the youtube video called "Dora the Murderer"?

The Mod powers are disabled cause they are now a diffent name, and you can't change it back cause of the disabled of name changes

Okay...nevermind...
Wait a minute, WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE! XD

@Dashite Yes please~ <3
03I got it

Thats nice PolarFire and how long habe you been here exactly?

maybe 7.
I cut my finger. . . T~T
03And I only needed to port forward through the rounter connected to it
SOMEBODY THROW ME INTO A VOLCANO!
I've missed the last 6, 4 for my vacation, 2 for personal reasons
I see.
:/
/me throws DeadlyPony into a volcano~
WOOOO!!!
virgin sacrifice?
@MisterBristle Then why would you say 3 weeks if you've been gone 6. . .? o:

*Has brosex with others* e3e
Wow, In have to do this AGAIN
this story has holes in it like a half-eaten doughnut
eeyup
03So it's like this: Modem -> Router -> Computers
This story has holes in it like Dashie in The Rerapening
...
Oh god, please don't bring that up again.
2Ugh! Still can't get to sleep! Oh, I'm back guys.:(:)
noooooo
D:
My setup is more like, Modem -> router -> Router -> Router -> Computer.
AND THEN
VioletVanilla I am dead from LOL
EVERYPONY CAME
<33
Just to use every possible resource I have.
NO NO DO
2 missed because personal reasons, left on friday, 1 miss, gone three weeks, 3 misses, WHERE ARE THE HOLES
do bring it up agaiin
03For some reason my ethernet switch wouldn't work with the modem
WHERE
WHERE!?!?!?!?
o:
03It probably only allows one computer connection
you say you missed the last 3.
I missed the last 6
but apparently you missed the last 6?
....
We're juss sayin' you seem a bit on the fritz about it all. . .
Gahah
now i'm just confused
WHY AM I ON FUCKING TRIAL?
well why isn't you name on the mod list?
03So I just connected my wireless router and am using that as aw ethernet switch now
/me calms MisterBristle down with a cupcake
03an*
ASK FUCKING HIPSTER, MR.JUDGE, HOLY SHIT
03And it works
Ask someone who isn't here?
oh god so much src bzness
*srs
Well, WHEN HE GETS BACK
Honestly I don't really care. If it's true, it's true.
@GGgala, I think we shall forever have The Rerapening as a hilarious reference. . .
2I kept having a weird image of a light blue Lugia with a dark blu belly and ect. The weirdest part, it had front legs like som sort of dragon.
Look, I just hate being on trial
I've got a follow up dramatic reading but I'm waiting to suggest it till that one's finished
@Dashite See that's the thing, if it's true then he wouldn't need to go all super defensive because he'd know we're jist trolling him
2zzzzzz...
@MisterBristle Hush now, Quiet now, it's going to be okay~ Lay down your little head, and dream the night away~
Yeah, but if he hasn't been around since the rest of us showed up he has no frame of reference for our behaviour to know if we are serious or not.
Violet, just ask Hipster, Silver, hell even Ghosties (he never liked me) when there around
9what's going on here?
9oh
ohai
DCD THANK GOD!
lol
ahahaha
9I think I got a hang of the situation
2did drfsuperenter leave?
INB4 mass kick!
DCD
9you're wondering why you're not in the mod list, right?
now the hilarious misunderstandings have to come to an end, aw
Um, Yes?
XD
he's fixing a computer or something
BLLLALALAALAL
Awwww. . .
/me has his breath bated
/me or whatever
/me shoves a cupcake down DeadlyPony's throat
So, you gonna tell me......?
I think they switched IRC servers.
Was I fired for going on vacation XD
You've been expelled from Hogwarts.
9well, I believe that since you were MIA without any news for so long, we thought you had stepped down from your mod duties. Additionally, we had to change the chat server so that explains why you can't log in with your name. Because it's not registered in this server, nor are your previous ops.
So, Hipster didnt tell ANYONE, I was on vacay?
see, I thought the server change was involved
NOBODY?
/me is struck with realization
9now, whether the other mods decide to bring you back to active server is beyond my hands. Or I don't know. I don't remember quite well.
<Drake> I'm angry.
9Well, Bristle
9c'est un question
9what equipment do you run?
/me hides the Realization behind his back before Polarfire discovers who hit him
DDKLDLDDLLDDL
I even told all of you I was going....
*Spits out cupcake*
What the hell man
LOL Dashite
Sasparela!>
9well, I don't really have much of a say in this than a regular mod
12hi
9additionally due to personal issues, I have been a bit out of the loop from modding as well (albeit not from streaming, for the most part)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJvVHAh_INM
ih
12having fun?
Well shit
ntrli
12o-o
9I'm contacting the other mods as we speak
Huh? What? How did I...?
12why did you open up another window?
I didn't. \
You know, I think I might just stay off the team, I was always kinda the loser of the group XD
12whatever, close it
your internet probably disconnect temporarily
12doesn't matter, just close it
6it's mibbit
6you can't get a second window without manually opening it
DOES THAT MEAN YOUR POSITION IS OPEN? <:
No.
Shut up.
XD
There was no position open.
Sorry, bristle. I didn't mean to grill you.
i think it was open weeks ago and got filled
There never was an open position.
yeah, I think the internet disconnected for a moment.
9eh, well, I wouldn't step down if I were you
We have always had a full mod team.
Why not DCD>
?
We have always been at war with Eurasia.
Shut up 1984
9We just opened applications again and we're making an important announcement tomorrow.
XD
I hate when that happens!
Yay~
Mod drama over?
No. . . .
IMPORTANT ANNOUCEMENT: Lottery selection is now moderator only.
may I get a preview of the annoucment, maybe in la mod room, (Which I swear if you changed again XD)
The drama has just begun. . .
9we're expanding, Bristle, btw
9we're switching hosts, as well
Spike: NOOOOOO!!!!
SCHWING!
AGAIN?!
NOW'S MY CHANCE!
Mrf...Ouch! Radja, get of me! Sorry my cat is way too friendly.
*off
we coming to geekshed?
9no, not that sort of expansion
9as in, "we're switching domains expansion"
9and
@GGgala: Oh Everypony is coming. . . c;
We bought out the other brony movie night.
@GGgala AT THE SAME TIME TEEHEE
9"we have to start looking for people who can stream the pony episodes live as they air in the Hub" expansion
9...and because of that
Well fuck me.
oooh like the guy on justin.tv?
Basil34?
12!biscuit
9"we have to develop a bigger chat system to control the influx of viewers during that time" expansion
weird lugia with four legs...huh?
12kyu isn't around, i'm surprised
9yeah, somewhat like that
12Aurora what did you do with kyu
9while I appreciate everything Basil's done, bless his soul
So, you need a TV tuner card
6I sent him to a box
So a ton of work, that I have no idea how to help in anyway with?
6in the middle of the pacific
6no, he's actually camping
6..
It did it again!
9the quality of his stream was, sadly, not up to my exigent, OCD-like standards for stream quality
12he'll make a wonderful treasure in the next windwaker game
6you need to close the tab
too true, DCD
wut?
6mibbit doesn't connect twice unless you have both tabs, and you do it by hand
12see that big red x
6in short: it doesnt do it by accident
yep
I mean really, I have NO IDEA how you guys set this shit up, half the time I feel like a liability
9not to mention the fact that a chat in which you could post only a minute is...well, boring
we need to see the gyrobowls commercial in glorious HD
IS THAT A BALLO-- LOOK AT THAT KITT-- MMM THIS SURE IS DELICIOUS DRIN-- HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT DASH'S BIG FAT SLOPPY WE-- I WONDER WHAT THE WEATHER IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE
we were using an IRC chatroom by the end, though!
it was called #LiveBrony , or #BronyLive ?
Random comment: my computer got stabbed by a butterknife.
on some network i can't remember
BRB
9well, Bristle
9here's the thing
9that thing I'm describing up there?
Teach them. . .
How to stream .. .
9We're gonna need some serious personnel
.-. FML
12irrelevant information
9don't misunderstand me
-headdesk-
9we want about three live-streamers in active duty
Me back...Once again...
9but we're also gonna need several other mods
INTERNET Y U SUCK SO MUCH?!
That's an excellent idea
9indeed.
6then close shadow
splitting I mean
ok
9also this shit is secret, don't tell anybody just yet.
okedoke
So no more 200 people trying to talk all at once.
Okie Dokie Lokie!
wait for it....
/me Pinkie Pie Swears
9we're aiming for rooms based in the mane 6 at first
9actually, Dashite
DCD, did you spill the beans? :3
9it would be like 300 people per room
6I would kill it but I can't
:O
9yeah, but it doesn't really hurt to tell you about our future plans right now
Honestly bro, I just don't think I'm cut out for the job, I mean look at me regular modding! I kinda sucked.....
DCD
12it's just going to come back apparently if i kill it
6that doesnt make sense though
9have you seen how much traffic Basil's _low quality_ stream had?
9around 2000 viewers
12i can't stay up forever x-x
ohai Sathi
morning
9now take a higher quality stream, without those chat restrictions
moar mods yay
Nope. I didn't get into the show until after it was all on youtube.
12i have to be up for a doctor appointment at 9:30AM and it's 1:37AM right now
Morning Sathi! :3

Hello Sathi, I don't belive weve met
12back
Well, night losa bronies :D!
Hey Sathi!
Night DeadlyPony
Kinda tired!
Hello Misterbristle
9it's not "we're trying to make this more manageable to read", it's more like "we're trying to keep it about the same level as movie nights, cause honestly, if the projected number of viewers come...that is going to be chaotic"
12Umbreon :)
Or Mornin
Yeah! Shadow's finally gone!
Whatever
DCD, is this the guy who took my job XD
NORNING!
12Hello :3
9You mean girl.

@Dashite CONSCRIPT REPORTING. MOVING OUT
12Been doing a lot of studying and internet stuff |D
9because we also do an encore Stream on Saturday for PAL territories as well
Yeah, I ;eft right around the time we started that
9so yeah...of course, we'd have to test viewership first
03Someone try connecting to irc.ambernova.net
03please
12And you Umbreon?
9but possibly streaming the episodes live could make it for...quite the influx of viewers, actually
12oh
ouch! Now my foster great dane is sitting on me! (GET OFF, SPENCER! (Spencer is the dog's name))
12bleh
12trying to fall aslepe
9we're actually working on a "increasing limit" system as well, and will make new rooms if necessary eventually
12Why does lemonade contain artificial flavor while cleaning products contain real lemon?
i will
one sec
LOL
Look, my real question DCD is, do I need to show up tommorrow? From the looks of it I don't seem to be on the team any longer, which I suppose doest bother me to horribly haha
12XD
on AmberNova nao
03Awesome, it works
9additionally a system that will redirect you to another room should the selected one be full...
Don't leave forever MisterBristle T~T

:D
9yeah, please be here by the preshow. An important announcement comes tomorrow
12lol
9since we got to talk this and stuff
Preshow starts, like 5?

@MisterBristle I just wanted to apologize for earlier and all, that wasn't very nice of me to frustrate you, especially after your own personal troubles and the such. . . v.v
D:
nini
9it would be highly illogical to not talk this through
12Why do banks charge a fee on insufficient funds when they know there is not enough?
wait, when did applications open again? was it a thread on ponychan?
Ouch! Stupid dog...Spencer sat on me again.
yeah, me too bristle. sorry man.
7take a look at fb / twitter :)
12Why does someone believe you when you say there are four billion stars, but check when you say the paint is wet?
9ah, yes, you didn't hear about that, did you?
@VioletVanilla No problem Brony, I over reacted, I'm a bit stressted XD
Damn you social media!
9click those links down there, will ya?
12Umbreon, do you have any foil Pokemon profile cards?

7Still talking to him
I'd say it sounds good though. :)
6?
12even before that
12Whose idea was it to put an S in the word lisp?
12They only have a picture of the Pokemon on one side, and the other side just talks about the Pokemon in the anime
7I'll just copy paste for him
12you mean topps?
Loving the approval Dashite, but sadly, its not good enough XD
12Yeah, tops XD

12staying here is just going to keep you awake :/
It's been pretty hell the past week
Mid to high 20's everyday. One day of rain on Wednesday.
Supposed to rain again tomorrow.
12might be hard to sleep but if you rest long enough it'll happen
35-44 ish here. No rain in... a month.

03or driving you insane
03if one desires that
Yeah, that's pretty bad.
We had no rain for the month of July.
12or driving someone else insane if you get the audiobook version
12and make them listen to it in their sleep
2Already read all my books. BUBA GET OFF ME!
03LOL
2:D
Its really sad, everything looks dead like winter. Nothing green, we've got trees that are 50+ years old all dying around us because of the lask of water.
12that's the beauty of books
12read them again :)
Worst drought in 80 years they are saying
read them again
or something like that

yeah. The power plants around here are firing up old school generators that haven't run since the 70's and 80's to keep up with demand.
12drf is a team player *nods*
03I am
lolo
03I just haven't said which team I'm playing for
First time some of them have been used in 25 years.
Wow
and there's STILL not enough electicity to keep up with people's AC demands.
12i call dibs on the fact that he'll grow up to work for apple
Its ridiculous. Next option is rolling blackouts, there's nothing left : /
12just so he can internally rip them apart
We set some records earlier this summer for heat, but electricity consumption didn't really spike too much above normal.
Ours has spiked unbelievably. Its off the charts.
Simply because it never cools off, not even after dark.
glhf with that
So people's home AC units run 24/7
again!? seriously!?:(
12what does hf mean?
SRS BZNS!
have fun
12oh
:D
Yeah, that's pretty harsh.
i call dibs on the fact that he'll grow up to work for apple
these smileys have blinding teeth...OW MY EYES!

And to top it all off, there's no end in sight.
12!fight
12smileys?
12that's not fair
12I don't see any smileys XD
12i see one now
No rain in the forecast at all. And temps stay pretty much how they have been.
That's probably the worst thing.
12you just used it
12LOL
Not having any idea when it's going to end.

03LOL
03I know the 3 lawsm
03but I don't follow them as I'm not a robot
12What are they?

03LMAO
03and like
031. A robot may not harm a human
I just came to a horrible thought, my favorite pianist might be a guy.
032. A robot must follow any orders given by a human as long as it does not contradict the first law
NO ONE KNOWS, SHE DOESN'T SHOW HER FACE ;O;
033. A robot may protect itself unless it contradicts the first two laws
03inb4 I order a robot to destroy itself :)

0______________0 H-hi, Barry
It's just a little thing we've had going.
I AM BULLETPROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF!
yeah, he told me my waifu'd rape me
Apparently, I'll be raped by Spitfire
I wish there was a way for me to livestream, so I could be like 'guys what soundeffect here?' etc and we could all make NewDCD a video ^_^
I don't take it too seriously
>Mr Breezy. I sure ai'nt taking it srsly :P
02dead chat is dead .-.
...who is Mr. Breezy? the most background of background ponies?
10.w.
One of them yes
but it's an official name
http://images.wikia.com/mlp/images/1/14/MrBreezy.png
Isn't he the garden worker in Canterlot?
which episode?
This one, to be precise :P
Oh, he's Mr. Breezy
Who's the garden worker in Canterlot, then?
oh the guy with the golf clubs?
'Loans one of his fans to the Cutie Mark Crusaders. Wears a green Tam o' Shanter and vest. Despite his name, he does not look like the G3 Breezies.'
oh. fans
There ya go
"Cutie mark: four-bladed fan"
Got a question? Always ask me i'm happy to help :3
Any Gs before G4 suck.
^
so he was just in the talent show episode?
Yea
But Mr Breezy is an official name, not fandom
derpy isnt her name it's ditzy doo
that's not quite official yet last i checked
lol i heard there make both name offical
making*
GGgala i'll scout around and find out why at least I thought it was official.
Faust leaving it up in the air is awesome
hmm
Yo.
her post on it said her name 'could' be Ditzy Doo if we wanted, she was floating it IIRC
Hellllllloooooo?
GGgala = "Official names are listed over a light blue background. The names are mentioned in the show, Hasbro's toy line, or stated by the show's crew."
Somehow somewhere (i'm looking now) Mr Breezy was official, according to wikia
RDash hey there
HELLO
I have tea
Hi.
:)
/me skips in circles
Ohai
GGgala -
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz-Sz03YbLY
Nice.
Yes
The CMC call him 'mr breezy.' Official enough? :3
Won't you join me
:)
oh i was just talking about derpy being ditzy
Ah ok then :P
So, what up?
Hi RDash
ohai RDash
In one scene in WWU, Ditzy goes the wrong direction to get the southern birds. I think that's the only time that name is ever used and it wasnt associated with Derpy yet
>Open up celestia radio >Derpy singing Muffins to the 'cupcakes' theme.

6 Dermathil's sex slave is 9App3le 8Fritter
at least Spike is cooler than all the previous waifus combined
06heya Ecco :3
Hey LU and everyone.
>mfw O Slave is actually an attack in SRW-J
GGgala Spike is 1 year old
... ojh
oh*
nvm then
that looks like a ruppee laz0r
*rupee
ah
you can tell how much I know about SRW
wha? no he isn't. Twilight didn't get her cutie mark last year
he's several years old
It's never determined how many years passed between Twilight's cutie mark and her moving to Ponyville
Barry, I probably know as much as you, except this game looks fking cool even if just a GBA game
So, what up?
/me yawns
right, so he could be anywhere from Twist's age to Gilda's
with dragon rate of aging
i guess
Wait, I thought he was one O.o
@pony RDash's willing servant
6 RDash's willing servant is 5Snai10ls
Hey Shadow, how is everyone doing today?
/me 6is back. Sorta.
6Not compulsed to chat. :P
Snails, I told you we had to break it off!
12lolz wb
It's not going to work between us
He may be one in pony years
6Thank you.
but in calender years, it's unknown
^true
6Hello, Shadow.
The age ratio of pony to dragon is also unknown
wait, is there somewhere people are getting the number one from specifically?
dunnolol
He hatched from his egg infront of Twi as a filly - he's surely over 1
Spike has seen at least some winter to spring transitions as he tells Twi to use magic in WWU
right?
@pony The pony that comforts RDash after all of the unsuccessful waifus and could possibly lead to a relationship if RDash likes her
6 The pony that comforts RDash after all of the unsuccessful waifus and could possibly lead to a relationship if RDash likes her is 7Applej8ack
YES
ah, so we're just making shit up as we go along then. business as usual
I think it's because it doesn't take long for a horse to become mature, only 4 years, and we've only seen one Summer Sun Celebration before this one
Which leads fans to believe only one year has passed between the two
yea but maybe more happened between the two celebrations?
Possibly
Nah i think it's got to be more than just one year
06BBL, Groceries >>
6Okay. ovo
6How long has she been away?
people are seriously assuming that was the last year's SSC?
weird
I want a real Gaydar
/me hides
6Lulz.
6Make one.
Also, however old Spike is, he's still a baby
6Or buy one off of cosplayers. :P
</watching too much YuGiOh Abridged>
which, if he's more than a year old, means that dragons mature very slowly
6I'd appreciate it more if it updated more often. :P
pretty much
btw, nice one RDash
finally got some luck
at last ;)
What up?
Thanks, any female, older pony is fine haha
6Currently? On a YouTubeWalk.
lol
but y u no liek gilda?
:)
because she's not a pony, she's a griffon
pony-racism
exactly
lol, you can have Gilda, Dman
look at how Zecora was treated
all for being a zebra
i no : /
She took the breakup hard, so now's a good time to ask
barry Yea
What was Twilight's friendship report on that episode again?
6o.o
12o-o
gilda one?
Zecora
Today I learned that it's hard to accept when somepony you like wants to spend time with somepony who's not so nice. Though it's impossible to control who your friends hang out with, it is possible to control your own behavior. Just continue to be a good friend. In the end, the difference between a false friend and one who is true will surely come to light.
ah zecora one brb
My friends and I all learned an important lesson this week: Never judge a book by its cover. Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary. But you have to look past that and learn who they are inside. Real friends don't care what your "cover" is; It's the "contents" of a pony that count. And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever
2Burp...Oops, already gone.
OH SNAP 10 seconds flat!
:P
lol
ah
haha
actually, more like 4 seconds :P
Did you have Gilda's ready? 0.0
Always happy to help ANYpony, everypony!

y u so meanie problem? rood wordies
2Bah! The level of Hanging Waters in Ecco the Dolphin: DotF is really frustrating and too much like Sky Tides and Tube of Medusa from Tides of Time.
0umad bro?
I toleratin'
problem dman?
Welcome to the machine then
I lovin'
lolwut
suddenly A MOD
2That one's even tougher! Those auto side-scrollers frustrate me too much.
nope.avi
Hi RainbroDash
hehehe

KEKSI KEKSI KEKSI !!!!! ~~~
10KEKSY KEKSY KEKSY
hey rainbrodash
10up to much apart from worrying about the interview dermathil? ;)
hey rainbrodash will all mods be there for demrathil's interview?
Never mind. I'm back.
cuz if you prince and sathi are you can all say nice things right
so dermathil can be mod
yeah, playing SRW-J that DCD sent me a link to. Fandubbed in english and patched by DCD (he said yours truly)
Trying to write a story when you're dead tired is a bore.
10interviewing mods isn't about saying nice things, it's about assessing potential I'm afraid
potenshul for what?
10for modding?
no problem
2Playing Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future and tackling the level Hanging Waters is even more frustrating when you've just woken up in the morning.
uh....wut?
The second part of Hanging Waters (After Fire and Ice) was the hardest of the three to me.
I'm going now, but i'll be back for BMN! bai bai
cya Dman
cya Dermathil
Hello all
2Still, I don't plan on quitting this game so easily. It's my current goal to try and complete DotF before I play anything else.
Where is admin?

Hey, what do you think of forums where mods are allowed to break their own rules?
10It depends on circumstance I think, what's the context?
you mean they can post porn?
No, they can flame other members
10but they don't allow people to flame back, essentially?
Right.
10Well that just sounds a bit power trippy to me, but I'd rather know more before I was too harsh :P
Sonic Stadium is like that.
Fuck that forum, seriously.
/me sweats to death
12Danny~

@Sathi Yes, finally! Though, I have to drive to Frankfurt tomorrow x.x I am not looking forward to long drive.
@RainBroDash Of course! What else would it be? ;D
<mfw my guitar picks up an electric toothbrush

10Ziltoid fucking miracles. They'll blow your mind
@Sathi Yeah, I've done it before.
BTW, question aimed at Sathi, but what are female bronies called? o: Because I'm tired of guys being like "YEAH MAN BRONY" and I'm like .-. I'm a girl. and then it's like
I'm a nothing. XD
Pegasis?
Its kind of meh
/me 12...
7Hmm I called myself bronette.. but I guess.. Bronies is unisex
03?
12who let the 12yr old write the dialogue for this character...
I like bronette~ x3
10I've heard people attribute the term 'Bronie' to female bronies before
10but it only works in a singular mention :3
7I like Bronette too
03what character?
7sounds classy
and then when we're together Sathi
We're Bronettas~
12Gruntilda's sister from Banjo-Kazooie

12Ive only played this for 8 hours lol

@Sathi Oh I have no doubt that it'd be close if not on par with one of Pinkie Pie's parties!
12about an hour per level is the average
7okiedoki-loki!
7If not will you attend tomorrow?
/me is gonna go play Banjo-Tooie

12I haven't bought that yet
10Only the cool kids attend saturday shows :3

"I'm sorry, Bleach fans; I'm so sorry. But I don't care what epic thing is happening when this song is on;﻿ ALL I CAN SEE IS TWILIGHT SPARKLE GETTING CLOSER. AND CLOSER! AND-- OH MY!!!"
^ Epic comment on that video.
And I agree RainBroDash! I've seen both you and Sathi there so. . . ;3
6Oh, surprisingly awesome live-action TF2-based video. o.O
oh lawl
/me thought YT changed their look...again >>
7^
6Lol.
/me 7is a happy lady now
10Perfect proof that only the cool kids show up on saturdays ;D
10I'm not sure what to think about Attack of the Killer Tomatoes
10or rather, what to expect from it
7neither do I
10I'm looking forward to inception since I haven't actually seen it yet hehe
inception will break minds
10plus.... ellen page :3
got heavy technical difficulties on PC
Ummm. . . I've actually seen AotKT. . . It's very hokey and isn't exactly a favorite, but it's enjoyable for the laughs
6o.o
10I've seen an atrocious number of films so far that I'd describe with that exact sentence since I started watching BMN... Damn B Movie selections :p
7We should totally watch: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073629/ and http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/ :)
^ @Sathi ALL OF THIS
10^First link: AGREED
LABYRINTH
7Wooh!
<33333
DANCE MAGIC DANCE
10I've never watched Labyrinth though >.>
7tis fun
sounds good
7Any other suggestions?
RE-animator is my b movie pick
10>Let's do the Time Warp agaain~
falling down is my a movie
7if I ever get to pick the A movie I pick Sin City
10EEEEP I really wanna watch it now
03o.o
For B movies. . . Hmmm. . . I don't really have huge ideas. . .
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088930/ I think this as one
12hmm...
and this http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120483/
/me I still don't get the line between A and B movies
12Mad Monster Mansion
10My A movie choice is between Scott Pilgrim (because we haven't seen it yet), The Wicker Man (for the NOT THE BEEES spam), and my serious choice: Die Welle.
/me 12there nao
I AM TRYING TO GET THE WICKER MAN
10Dumori the official divide is done by budget. But here we tend to make the decision on 'A' or 'B' as being down to seriousness :P
the wickerman is really terrivle
10NOT THE BEES
exept for the last 20 mins

11The Amazing Spiderman

11It's already got a sequel green lighted and a release date set.
oh god, that means they are gonna churn that out like twilights.
*shivers*
Can we just have Season 2 already? Seriously
11That's a pretty big risk seeing how the last series went down in flames.
11and the overall reaction to the new movie is luke-warm at best.
This isn't super fun. I want my money back!
because of the 1st person sequence at the end.
11exactly.
So, what up?
lol
First, that scene was way too much CGI.
11I like how they're keeping with the dark, realistic tone that's been set recently.
They need to make it look more realistic.
hankhill = MG?

11 \o/
11too bad we can't have grills on campus here. :\
yeah. The dark tone is good, but the CGI (because it was 100% cgi and nothing else) was way too much everywhere.
11It's a nice day for a cook out.
07Meep!
I don't got grills but I still wear braces.
07Just, I miss someone is all.
07Two weeks of no communication is wearing me down.

/me falls back cause chair breaks.

6Not too sharp on troubleshooting here.

10Denied_Existence I'm sure you'll see ;)
silverscreen, fast or slow zombies?
oh lawdy
The zombies pile up CombustibleLemons
11Both.
just some cute plush and some granades
then they can climb up
rainBroDash - http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/facethumbs/50.webp

resistant to 40,000+ zombies.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/50.jpg
RainBroDash...Oh, will I?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
10yarp DE ;)
so that's a pretty damn good fortress
the characters are twilight strudel, applegold, raristein, pinkie kraut, Rainbow SSlash, and doktorshy
remember to double tap
chainsaw TBH. With plenty of fuel. Just let it rip and let em' come. I DARE EM'!
Hmm.....
but srsly, best zombie weapon is the classic sawed-off
Do I have to guess?
Lightsaber is my weopon of choice
nope, chainsaw is the classic anti zombie weapon
best zombie weapon is katana, actually, denied_existence :P
Now for something completely different this night" Pizza that you take home and bake.
you can't actually kill a zombie, what you're really doing is destroying their nerve system
The chainsaw is realities lightsaber
0I pick Cloud's Blade from Advent Children
dsnesmith - closeenough
Constant stream of death ftw
10Denied_Existence it's not dari no XD
0 6 BLADES IN ONE
Dman Well you don't exactly find katana's very often
0FUCK YES
so I choose chainsaw and I'll use it once the bodies can reach me,
/me 11's weapons of choice: Spas-12 Shotgun, Desert Eagle Pistol, Machete.
Where as AK's are plentiful
katanas dont' need gas, though
denied_existence - dat gramer apostrophe plural
Dman Meh
lul
Sue me
Desert Eagle is a nice choice there

rainbow dash is 20% more shippable than the average pony, and let's poll: les, straight, or bi?
Hipster, did you block me on Skype?

Bi, man
We're late today....Wait does this mean that there won't be a pinkiequest this wek either?

Hipster_Brony

0lol shippers
Tacowiz is still talking about how Hipster abandoned Skype :D
/me Unsure of how he wanted to spend his day, Silver decided on flying around town in search of somepony he knew or whatever looked interesting. With a powerful beat of his wings, he lifted off of the ground and over the heads of several earth ponies before clearing the rooftops and into the great blue expanse above.
So, what's going on?
ship ups x FedEX omg
waiting
Why is the broadcast offline?
Oh, ok.
/me waves at Silvermane

0yay

Thanks for that vid, dermathil =]
I must go back in time to stop that happening!
is it soon ready?
SOON
durger just no
infinitrice
I read that fic at work. Rainbrodash, i'm so glad no one read what was on the paper, and i nearly beat my head in. fortunately the laive was loud enough to muffle my repeated 'WHAT's
RainBroDash just clopped to the image of an army of Rainbow Dashes enslaving pony-kind
When are scientists gonna make genetic engineered ponies like fluttershy?
the streamer is been exiled to the moon?
no bueno!
no prob Dman
0lol
Watch this while we wait -> http://miburl.com/LjTRxV

Holy crap, didn't realize so many people joined
10ReticentSmolder Who doesn't? Every night.
7eeeyup
I made it to 2500 last week
>mfw people can't wait a few minutes :-/
yeah, we're up on EQD
there's supposed to be a movie night
0bwoooooong
>20 is a few
>okay.png
CronoFlash, no, we wait for the fic to continue
D: celestia was not impressed by his foalery in his "pre movie entertainment"
well, until dcd gets back, I'll be playing terraria
shut up sklar the English language suks
Poor magneton, reduced to a glorified battery so that she can surf the internet and watch TV on the commute to work.
continue with the fic :)
2500 people?
/me IF YOU ARE WONDERING ABOUT THE MOVIE, THE STREAMER WILL BE HERE SOON. PATIENCE PLEASE
so, does anyone really want to hear what I'm writing for the fic or would you guys rather have me dump large sections all at once?
2500 :O
okies
0Is Inception really as good as people make it out to be?
300 actually
that's all I needed
to know
sucks kenneyc
Too many movies use BWOOOOONG in their trailers.
I'm told
BerryPunch - better :P
300 needs to be a brony movie!
8BerryPunch: yes, better
k have the origin of canadian bronyism right in front of me
@BerryPunch I'd answer...but I'm afraid the mods would kick me :P
that Inception is a just a slightly-not-as-good version of Shutter Island
Inception's decent.
it took me 3 hours to get the internet working at this damn hotel
Lol hipster_Brony herdmind XD
And both are really good
so
4All I know is that Inception has Ellen Page
I liked it
someone start streaming and entertain us
Fritz, it was funny at first now it's annoying BWOOOONG
Inception is compared to Shutter Island?
point taken sklar
it's a cool flick, but it's not a deep psychological thing
Yeah while i was waiting for the stream to start I just had ponyspin on for a good while
10Ghosties has the right idea. Ellen Page all over this shit.
if it has scarlett i'm sold
I hate Inception more and more each time I watch it.
Inception is a very well put together action movie.
Never saw Shutter
inception os slightly overrated
Quick reticentsmolder, more shipping to entertain the ponies!
All I know is it's hard to understand.
and that's about it
8our streamer is parking right now, he will be here momentarily
All I know about Inception is BWONG
Xiagu has it
RainBroDash would probably explode twice if Rainbow Dash and Ellen Page happened to be the same person canonically
If I win the B-movie lottery tomorrow, do I choose Planet of the Apes or Rocky Horror?
so yeah, what xiagu said
It's a very well put together action movie
Theres not many inception memes that are very goo-BWOOOOOOONG
On one hand, Planet of the Apes is a classic.
MMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm quite kennyc
inception may or may not be a dream
0BWOOOONG
On the other hand, Rocky Horror is a MUSICAL.
I thought the lottery was tonight?
Planet of the apes I say
Tacowiz, ROCKY
double rainbow? http://poorlydressed.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/fashion-fail-rave-rainbow-vomit.jpg
we definitely need a rocky horror screening
10ReticentSmolder... I think I would explode thricew
http://mibpaste.com/M0fiAZ
10thrice*
all the way
8lottery is saturday
be back have to eat... whats up first?
spoiler alert: nazis get killed
:P
Screw Planet of the Apes. Someone needs to make Planet of the Ponies as I suggested
ya'll need to pick wicker man
/me does the time warp again
I like how Inception manages to maintain Magic A is Magic A all the way through (mostly)
I'm going to go with "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Fantastic Adventures of Unico"
thricew
:D
anypony want the inception button? http://inception.davepedu.com/
How come it doesn't work?
Hey, Silvermane, that's stuck in my head now. So thanks for that.
then again, I assume there'll be a special rocky horror showing sometime
it says that the broadcast is offline
Saturday? Well, we are running la-BWOOOOOOOONG!!
I love those buttons
gamergodjones it's down
Totoro is amzing, but I prefer Spirited Away.
Planet of the ponies! I know when a human lands in equestria :)
