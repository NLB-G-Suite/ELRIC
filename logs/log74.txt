/me ignites the beam of his sword, readying for the charging D_man
"You should have taken the time to build a mech foal!"
9jus' sayin', it's everything wrong with the industry
9same with Naruto
0I know i know
9One Piece is acceptable, but overrated
0I just liked it
9my advice: quit halfway through Hueco Mundo. It goes FULL STUPID nearing the end.
/me attempts to stab upwards at D_man
9I was like "fuck this shit I ain't reading no more"
0NewDCD lol. i am strugglin' through (i mean 2 years of strugglin' lol) seasons 4 and 5
Hi

BELLY BUTTON LAZ0R
/me prefers the more mechlike mechs like this one.
9so yeah
wait...
Macross
welp, he left.
as in ROBOTECH?
I LOVED THAT SHOW WHEN I WAS A KID
lol fffffffffffffffffff
9Super Robots, like Gurren Lagann, are...yeah, Macross F
9so I don't use them
yeah. I prefer the real robots
by like a mile.
I liked the veritechs :(
9some Supers have much crazier attacks though
9and that is fun
9the Macekreisms of the show were the bad thing about Robotech
9Go watch it
9go watch it right now
hmmm
9actually, according to Macross Canon
9basically, both the TV show and movie are different "documentaries" of the same events
interesting
s/narrator/animator-producer-etc/
9somewhat. More like "inexactitudes of history"
9also, watched Macross Plus?
9well
lol
9it was
it's 3 weeks before I go back to college, and I already have homework :P
yeah
lol
that sounded like they said "gokaiger"
stream interrupt for anyone else?
man...why doesn't Japan port these games in English?
I would totally buy it if it were translated
9as well as niche fanbase
stupid American taxes...
9basically
9as awesome as it is
9it wouldn't sell enough
9to warrant it considering the costs
how does it sell in Japan then?
any fandub?
and I'd bet there's a larger audience than they expect
9Gala: like hotcakes
9I'd recommend starting with J
9there are many SRW games translation projects because this series is very popular
DO WANT
9give me a moment
it was on gamecube
Mechwarrior?
oh, Gamecube
no

/me needs a GBA emulator
but suddenly I don't care
9also
Virtual GBA is good
9play at 2x or 3x size with the corresponding HQ Filter
9for prettier graphics
alright
oh damn it
9also brace for awesome plot
my gba emulator is on my other computer
grrrr
9because SRWs are always great on plot
9too bad we can't understand most of it
dat plot
lol
lolololol
is there also a PS1 emulator while we're at it?
9ePSXe
Epsxe
9or a PSP
awww
whore :P
I ain't got no PS console

9If you liked this stream and like shit with explosions and manlyness
9and like ponies as well
9please read my fic, "Kamen Rider Wyburn"
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?
<3
paid for by the "NewDCD's future 6-stars rating council"?
02*WB03(Drake03)02WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
12dwakkkkkkkkke
04Boo muthafuggas
04BREEEE
04It's good to be back
it's just an exe
no installing
12yes it is
12hi
well from where I dl
whoo Antipodes update
yes GGgala
9technically I got a story with 6 stars
9but it's not Wyburn
9Wyburn is rated pretty low...I think there were some people that downgraded stories labeled "Grimdark" going around at the time though
yeah that was weird..
9because this was around the time when everyone flipped their shit due to Cupcakes...I THINK.
9might be mixing up the events
9but I'm pretty sure I got some random "1" votes
in mid-march?
12.......
12where is Aurora's mod
9lemme see...
12hiding
>mfw i'm unsurprised at saddlesore fanfic police
9yeah, March
04so
04boo
12that's my line
How do I put HD settings on the GBA emulator?
delete system 32
9April...hmm
clopfic reading time?
9Dermathil: There should be a "window size" option around
yesssssssssssssssss
9choose the multiplier
All of my money
9then find the "filters"
gasp
you ez torrenting inception
9but yeah
for shame :P
9I think it was around the time
9oh look
9I forgot to turn off the stream
9well
9as I said
9I'm poor
lol
You mean you don't legally acquire all the movies for movie night?! :O
Feb 24th really? wow
>I hate the Inception haters. The movie is good if you watch it again!
If you watch it again it makes more sense!
>the movie is shit if you watch it again* fixed :P
you misunderstand
i have no feelings on inception whatsoever
GRRRR
I don't hate it because I don't understand it
and i watched it twice
when in reality it's just a waste of money
(all the shitty romance movies)
it's still a turd
heh...that was a quote from one of my teachers actually
it's still a turd
He made both movies
Inception was his idea
Spielburg made Jurassic Park...he also made Indiana Jones 4
4Hey!
4Shut up
I never said it was bad, just that it was overrated.
4overrated implies it's not as good as it's made out to be
4Which is negative
4which = bad
ung...
:/
(I can lend it to you for Violet's case)
I would certainly say it's the best of the comic book hero movies
4Eh
I'm assuming that's the planned sequel for it?
Val, that's the ANNOUNCED sequel
not just planned.
Elektra?
4But oh well
Elektra = WORST comic book hero movie ever according to everyone. . .
Oh well, if you want to come over that's fine too. . .
XD
AAAAAH! Oh, I'm talking to myself. Nice.
YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND, IT'S AN ACQUIRED TASTE
maybe, but my point of view is right ;)
"you're too elitist/not elite enough to enjoy it!"
9WELP
I imagined gary's mod there
lol
9Seems I'll have to draw a picture for Wyburn's next update
04o-o
:3 I wanna see pishure~
>MFW I discover all the mech pilots are teens and not professional adults.
9well
9I have some working designs here...

School is over yo.

04SACRILEGE
oh man
04WE ARE AT WAAAAAAAR
04*ahem* No I don't think it's stupid and evil.
O:
I'll just be in my little corner down here.
lol
Or the free remake
04It's extremely childish and the humour could use some work here and there, but it's still an amusing show and there is a reason it's such a juggernaut for Nickelodeon's ratings.
I'm totally not building anything!
bree
/me hides his under construction Mavor
Ever been to Nickalodeon resorts?
12nick doesn't really have anythings
I gave it up remember?
12no i don't
04No I haven't
I ain't saying anything against TA.
04hi
There's even a free remake out there somewhere.
12i've been to the mall of america
12if that counts
angry much?
called Spring
well, Nickalodeon has people dressed up as Dora walking around, and Dora is EVIL!
Total Annihilation is alright. . .
:p
12i did not see that
lol
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_%28game_engine%29
It's very outdated though. . .
I think it still holds
12nothing is evil
I mean, the modding community for TA is STILL going
Except ketchup bottles
Well, that's not saying too much. . .
it's still a very strong community
and that's like. . .
yeah.
Just look up Complete Annihilation or Balanced Annihilation for idea.
04brb installing AoM
tis a good mod
Natural Selection
which i've heard such great things about
Very good mod
9so yeah
Terrible players
x.x
Watch it. It's pretty rediculous. (I spelled that wrong, didn't I?)
lol
fair enough
Synergy was a really fun HL2 mod...for a while at least
I played it about three weeks ago. . .
isn't there a half-life mod where you seem to be playing someone who's locked up in a hospital hallucinating the zombies?
GGgala: Probably. . .
XD
AIR RAID SIREN
I wouldn't be surprised
(in the gba port)
04Ridiculous*
you know, WC3 had a really good modding community
it's a shame blizzard killed the universe with WoW
x.x
WC3
then again
I'm right here.
WAS MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD RTS aside from C&C and Starcraft
DotA killed everything that was good about WC3
My cat is going beserks.
stupid fucking DotA
I wish it had never been made...
I never got into WC3.
i'm back from being afk ;o
I hated the heroes.
I can understand that
personally I liked it because it was just a more organized micro management
04wb
thanks
It blended micromanagement but wasn't like
Starcraft levels? :P
UNIVERSE AT WAR
Well, that too. . .
I played Starcraft for the melee games, I played Warcraft III for the custom maps and the story
unfortunately...it seems that only Starcraft has kept the story part
Starcraft 2. . .
<3
AND THEN
EVERYPONY CAME
(aha! I was thinking of the Half-Life mod /They Hunger/)
I was very pleased with SC2
they really improved on their storytelling with it
They Hunger has a few servers still up, it's a decent mod! GGgala
Eh...
Story in SC2 was...
And the music made me cream rainbows~
:P
12silly radio hosts
It was too game-y. They were more focused on creating missions to teach you how to use all the units.
TUTORIAL TOWER
15 missions of Tutorials
again, it was improved
the Starcraft I story telling was awful
with the same like...2 missions over and over again
LOL
sure, it was excusable with WC2, because that was cutting edge at the time
That's not a story issue, that's a mission design issue.
12?
/me 6BOINK
you mean survive/kill all enemy buildings?
12????
03Oh
03my
03god

03looked like a fly mixed with an earwig
03grossest thing I've ever seen
03well
x.x Bad Images
03it would fly around a bit then vanish
12can't earwigs fly?
03so I couldn't use my bugzapper to kill it
reach this flag and then defend it
03after a while
03eventually I sucked it up with the vacuum but x__________-x
lol
you spammed goliaths on the terrazine mission?
03nop
03-p
6wat
12ewwwwwww wkinect
04AoM is working heckyes
Probably more than anything else.
well I prefer a long tutorial over fighting the same thing over and over again with the same strategy
at least there's a feeling of progress and learning
12or were you just pulling my tail
welp, I think I'm going to call it a night
g'night gents
Night.

Thats nice PolarFire and how long habe you been here exactly?

I cut my finger. . . T~T
03And I only needed to port forward through the rounter connected to it
SOMEBODY THROW ME INTO A VOLCANO!
I've missed the last 6, 4 for my vacation, 2 for personal reasons
I see.
:/
/me throws DeadlyPony into a volcano~

03So it's like this: Modem -> Router -> Computers
...
2Ugh! Still can't get to sleep! Oh, I'm back guys.:(:)

My setup is more like, Modem -> router -> Router -> Router -> Computer.
AND THEN
EVERYPONY CAME

Just to use every possible resource I have.
NO NO DO

03For some reason my ethernet switch wouldn't work with the modem
WHERE

03It probably only allows one computer connection
you say you missed the last 3.
I missed the last 6
but apparently you missed the last 6?
....
Gahah
WHY AM I ON FUCKING TRIAL?
well why isn't you name on the mod list?
03So I just connected my wireless router and am using that as aw ethernet switch now
03an*
03And it works
*srs
Look, I just hate being on trial
I've got a follow up dramatic reading but I'm waiting to suggest it till that one's finished

Um, Yes?

BLLLALALAALAL
Awwww. . .
/me has his breath bated
/me or whatever
I think they switched IRC servers.
Was I fired for going on vacation XD
You've been expelled from Hogwarts.
see, I thought the server change was involved
/me is struck with realization
9now, whether the other mods decide to bring you back to active server is beyond my hands. Or I don't know. I don't remember quite well.
<Drake> I'm angry.
9what equipment do you run?
DDKLDLDDLLDDL
I even told all of you I was going....
*Spits out cupcake*
Sasparela!>
9well, I don't really have much of a say in this than a regular mod
12hi
9additionally due to personal issues, I have been a bit out of the loop from modding as well (albeit not from streaming, for the most part)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJvVHAh_INM
ih
12having fun?
Well shit
ntrli
12o-o
9I'm contacting the other mods as we speak
12why did you open up another window?
I didn't. \
You know, I think I might just stay off the team, I was always kinda the loser of the group XD
12whatever, close it
12doesn't matter, just close it
6it's mibbit
6you can't get a second window without manually opening it
No.
XD
There was no position open.
i think it was open weeks ago and got filled
There never was an open position.
9eh, well, I wouldn't step down if I were you
We have always had a full mod team.
Why not DCD>
?
We have always been at war with Eurasia.
9We just opened applications again and we're making an important announcement tomorrow.
XD
I hate when that happens!
Yay~
Mod drama over?
No. . . .
IMPORTANT ANNOUCEMENT: Lottery selection is now moderator only.
may I get a preview of the annoucment, maybe in la mod room, (Which I swear if you changed again XD)
The drama has just begun. . .
9we're switching hosts, as well
SCHWING!
AGAIN?!
Mrf...Ouch! Radja, get of me! Sorry my cat is way too friendly.
*off

6no, he's actually camping
6..
It did it again!
9the quality of his stream was, sadly, not up to my exigent, OCD-like standards for stream quality
6you need to close the tab
wut?
6mibbit doesn't connect twice unless you have both tabs, and you do it by hand
yep
I mean really, I have NO IDEA how you guys set this shit up, half the time I feel like a liability
we need to see the gyrobowls commercial in glorious HD
we were using an IRC chatroom by the end, though!
it was called #LiveBrony , or #BronyLive ?
Random comment: my computer got stabbed by a butterknife.
on some network i can't remember
BRB
9here's the thing
9that thing I'm describing up there?
Teach them. . .
How to stream .. .
.-. FML
12irrelevant information
9don't misunderstand me
-headdesk-
9we want about three live-streamers in active duty
Me back...Once again...
9but we're also gonna need several other mods
That's an excellent idea
9indeed.

ok
okedoke
wait for it....
/me Pinkie Pie Swears
9we're aiming for rooms based in the mane 6 at first

12it's just going to come back apparently if i kill it
6that doesnt make sense though

right?
YES
I think it's because it doesn't take long for a horse to become mature, only 4 years, and we've only seen one Summer Sun Celebration before this one
Which leads fans to believe only one year has passed between the two
yea but maybe more happened between the two celebrations?
Possibly

Also, however old Spike is, he's still a baby
6Or buy one off of cosplayers. :P
</watching too much YuGiOh Abridged>
which, if he's more than a year old, means that dragons mature very slowly

0Is Inception really as good as people make it out to be?
300 actually
that's all I needed
to know
sucks kenneyc
Too many movies use BWOOOOONG in their trailers.
I'm told
k have the origin of canadian bronyism right in front of me
that Inception is a just a slightly-not-as-good version of Shutter Island
Inception's decent.
Lol hipster_Brony herdmind XD
And both are really good
4All I know is that Inception has Ellen Page
I liked it
someone start streaming and entertain us
Inception is compared to Shutter Island?
Yeah while i was waiting for the stream to start I just had ponyspin on for a good while
10Ghosties has the right idea. Ellen Page all over this shit.
if it has scarlett i'm sold
I hate Inception more and more each time I watch it.
Inception is a very well put together action movie.
Never saw Shutter
inception os slightly overrated
All I know is it's hard to understand.
and that's about it
All I know about Inception is BWONG
Xiagu has it
It's a very well put together action movie
Theres not many inception memes that are very goo-BWOOOOOOONG
MMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm quite kennyc
inception may or may not be a dream
