-__-, funny thing. I need to play Modern WArfare 3 to get my friend to play League of Legends. And if I can get him to play League, my other friend will watch an episode of MLP. It's a vicious circle
:D
Vicious indeed

Airpuff: It's a shame I know all of them, hmm? ;)
I will, this weekend
As much as I love MLP, I equally love Pokemon

Woodenfan: it evolves at L20, doesnt it?
Bronysith: YOU ARE A PIRATE!
GilDash: YAR HAR

Throw money at it Woodenfan
YAR
GilDash: I guess, feel free. Dont think you'll find em though x)
With a yar har har and a bottle of RUMMMM
Nittany_Discord: he did :P

YOU ARE A PIRATE!!
every time Wrek streams i'm impresed and jeaoulus
im watching [MashUP] The FRESH Prince of RAINBOW Factory on u2be
Woodenfan: correction, L28.
Pfft, Wrek, sleep. It's too mainstream.
Yeah I know, I've played for YEARS
/me kisses Airpuff.
/me 11,01knocks Wrek out.
11,01Now sleep!
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4769/
Airpuff: I think you underestimate me. ;)
is magic inherently kinky?
omg
Woodenfan: so, getting B/W?
/me 11,01deflates Airpuff
I've memorized every evolution except for gen 4
B/W2^
Bronysith|Pirate: Lul
/me is being deflated? o.o
I would never use Fluttershy!
Wrek IS UNCONSOUS AND STILLD DRAWING!?!
le sigh i need to draw
flutter__shy moans
/me uses magic to turn normal.
Here's my favorite Gens in order (least to most): G4, G5, G1, G2, G3
/me kisses GilDash back
There!
/me force chokes Woodenfan
:O
R/B was best pony
Woodenfan what G5?
I don't like B/W at all. I've played it 3 times, and every time I find myself liking it less and less
i find your lack of faith disturinbg Woodenfan
flutter__shy type /me if your doing actions
oh lol ok
Invi: Black and White XD
Woodenfan: G3 G4 G5 G1 G2
Invi: Dude, it's been out for awhile
brb again guys
/me moans
who here has played demons souls?
anypone
pony
Airpuff: It doesn't have to end there. ;)
g2 is awesome that's my second favorite for a reason, but I grew up with Emerald, that game is still my favorite of all time
/me is bored and watching [MashUP] The FRESH Prince of RAINBOW Factory
SayWhat oh lol I don't like them
STLL HERE
*STILL
The first pokemon I played was Silver. And I still play it
i played the first 3 gens but didn't get a DS
the only good things to me that came out of G3 was Abilities and Breloom.
HAS ANYPONY HERE?!?! played demons souls?
and Swampert.
I brought it in a gameboy color to school one day and just was sittin in math class
Just had to sit and draw for a bit~
Playing pokemon
/me giggles at GilDash "Really now?"
But there is the glory of two screens
dat fun
Airpuff: If you think you're up for it? ;)
/me me gusta
SayWhat: Heart Gold/Soul Silver is a pretty good remake.
I have been able to see ya'll all the time!
Here's one reason I don't like B/W: The animations are really REALLY boring. Most of the time it's them hopping around in a continual loop! To the other gen's credit, even though it was really short, the animations caught my eye and were pleasing. B/W's don't.
SayWhat G1 was designed to be about 200 pokemon instead of 150
HAHA
h that~
/me looks at GilDash "Please.. I'm a god?"
Invi: about 170.
*Oh
WallDives: Yeah but it didn't have the same 'appeal' that it used to
i liek dis sing :3
WallDives not 200?
08,01i'm currently working my way through Crystal on an GBC emulator on my phone
08,01it's really fun!
Sheeit
08,01i got bored of Red
Airpuff: Prove it. :)
Invi: not really. There were a few scrapped, but theres slots for aprox 170 in the coding for R/G.
What's your team so far?
Also, the first pokemon ever created (and is my favorite) is Rhydon.
08,01i can't remember
08,01i've jsut started out
Starter?
I have super smash bros 64 still. It's worth like 40 bucks
my team is. mewtwo, mewtwo, mewtwo, mewtwo and mewtwo
08,01alexxm: it's certainly much better than Red
Woodenfan: its supposed to, since its supposed to be a reboot of sorts.
And Mario Kart 64
Bronysith|Pirate: illegal team, go!
I know, but it shouldn't have been!
:'(
GilDash: ....... hmpf. :P

08,01and it's really fun to play on my phone, because my phone has a physical keyboard!
Your manes Teglo!
08,01Litwick: the fire one, i think
Woodenfan: why not? they spent more time on the story. and where else where they going to go?
Airpuff: Oh, is that a no from my "god"? :p
They are amazinbg!
/me appeared!
/me slices off Abra s head
i hate pokemon
The postgame is awful as well. I don't want to fight level 60+ basic evolutions, it's really boring
/me sent out Murkrow
Woodenfan: I'll give you that.
/me throws Pokeball at Abra
/me it's super effective!
/me boop
Use your Thunder Smash! PIKA PEEEE

The exp scalar curve is alright, but it gets grating because I like to be overleveled.
GilDash: Who said it was a no? xD
/me escaped from the pokeball
/me force chokes Abra
/me cast teleport!

GilDash: yeah yeah. i tryed

Meanwhile: no big suprise
anyone want to PM?
Hat: kinda i find it harder to draw ona tablet cause it seens like u dont have as much control but it makes dawing a lot easier with layers and the all holy undo button'
Airpuff: I don't want you to try. I want you to go through. ;)
Invi: I know, what I was asking was if you beat the R2 version of Stadium 2.
Big Mac is trying to learn a word, but he already has 4 slots used! Forget a word?

08,01Also, you should be aware that Rationalism is quite a spooky philosophy. People that are Rationalists try to act rationally all the time, they believe there is only one right thing to do - the right thing - for a given goal and set of beliefs. You may spot one or two people who are Rationalists - they stand out! Are we being sensible in creating only rational computers? You have been warned!
I see yellow

/me noz
so you can't keep up with it
nomz*
I went to their concert last night, Ashleigh Ball was awesome.
Wrek do it The design is epic!
05then i felt a chill dont my spine and my wrist wirthed in ibjection
05p*
Randomnerd: We all know that she is awesome
05wn*
Nah, no armor
SO AWESOME! /)^3^(\
Woodenfan why?
Wrek: stow it away in the "Draw Later" section of your brain
CupcakeWarrior: why wub the voice actors
Not worth it, makes Rarity too...Rainbow Dash-like.
rarity is lookin nice!
But I saw her in concert, and I even saw the guy who does the dramatic reading of my little pony
The Orson Welles Impersonator "orangecow"
Wrek: Gold detailed armor with amethyst gems? hah....that screams carpral syndrom...
Wrek's having trouble with his spelling?
I think RD should be the only armor wearer. If you don't mind, I'm playing Sonic 06 2D. This is a good hack.
AND an autographed album :)
Woodenfan well it depends on the armor
Litwick: nothing new
yeah
Nomz on sandvich

dem pings
ehhhhhh freaking dusty desert killed my ring streak again
real quote
Trying to get higher scores (I've gotten all S-ranks already)
Woodenfan: shit ranks?
>Caring about haters
Prfft!
no
Woodenfan: its not to hard to get S rank in that game
Woodenfan: stupid ranks?
08,01i love this definition:
Q: S-ranks
Haters
08,01“Artificial Intelligence is the study of techniques for solving exponentially hard problems in polynomial time by exploiting knowledge about the problem domain”
Are entertainment!
Woodenfan: so stupid ranks?
oh forget it Q
08,01it makes me chuckle
CCCP tara says a lot when the day is long
eeeeh
Invi: tara is best pony
ikr? ^^
^
exploting knowledge
CCCP: well she does voice twilight
Sonic is fun though
But as far as voice acting goes
Bronysith: yes she does
08,01DaringDude: what of it?
Tabitha St. Germaine is a bloody GODESS
Hey speaking of, did you know that Tara's voicing the cheerleader in Lollipop Chainsaw?
08,01Manearion: well why don't you just go marry her then!
:D
08,01if you love her so much
<w<
Woodenfan: 0_0
Twilight Sparkle: Chainsaw Cheerleader
08,01Woodenfan: yeah, i saw that
ausidg]
Tara is married to all the bronies
You are probably a real nice bloke you are
CupcakeWarrior: i love her
08,01Woodenfan: it was creepy hearing Twilight's voice
Tabitha St. Germain is freaking awesome as rarity, I'm still wondering what made her think Derpy was a little boy
But I just don't know you that well yet....
Lollipop chainsaw?
08,01Woodenfan: yeah
Whats that?
yeah look it up
It's freaking nuts
exploiting is a strangely humanistic trait
ANYHOOF
Manearion: yes
Don't be afraid to look silly. - tara strong
Woodenfan: I'd assume whoever passed her the scrip derped up.
I find it interesting that Vinyl
and Gordon Freeman
you're right GilDash
Has the same voice actress
ARTZ
Manearion: lol
pfffft Manearion.
i can roleplay as chell, gordon freeman, crono, all in one go
Woodenfan: Actually, I think I remember Tabitha stating that she was told Derpy was a boy, so... :S
I still think a Derpycentric episode should be in order and it should have the moral: Even though you might look different, your friends still love you. That'd be a great lesson for the kids
Yeah, stuff happens
Woodenfan: yea it would
tara strong is wise
tara strong is awesome
Anyone seen Twilightlicious?
Woodenfan: who hasnt?
and Flutterlicio-HNNNNNNNNNGH oh god
Tara Strong is TWILIGHTLICIOUS
If there was a Derpy episode, they wouldnt name her Derpy in it
who hasn't Woodenfan
sorry sorry
Anyone hasn't seen twilightlicious?
I NEED TO SLEEP

It's fine, but doesn't rarity wear slightly purple mascara?

No I just mean Octavia over all <3
Hmm
05as you can see its clearly a shade of turqiose
That Rarity looks FABULOUS!
Although Vinyl Scratch <3 <3 <3
Gets a triple heart for best pony!
Agh! I'm falling into Rarity's eyeball!
Yepp Teglo!

Dude...
hello everypony
Hey xmasskills
actually the best pony is chrysalis
Hai DCD
moin xmasskills
09,01o-hay-o
hi xmasskills
Chrysalis ISN'T a pony
hi NewDCD
Scratch has said nothing! See how much my careface is shinging!
CCCP but she is no pony
NewDCD: hey
*shining
moin NewDCD
Cobellanez: she can turn into one tho
Invi: yes she is!
But she isn't
Look at my beautiful name :|
^
Octavia is next best pony
And of course
Changelings are definitely pony-shaped.
<3
EXPLAIN WHO CHRYSALIS IS NOT A PONY :[
CCCP she can look like a pony, but isn't biologically one. she is a changeling
*Vinyltavia
HOW*
hiya NewDCD
Fluttershy is best Fluttershy
(Equssnoid?)
Cobellanez: LIES
Neigh
Manearion: there is no best pony and if there was it wouldnt be octavia

Wrek: it was Nabronyan
I would totally marry Lyra
Wrek: Ninjazz.
CCCP shecan only look like a pony. her magic is stil green what implies, that only her shape changed...
I'm convinced that the changelings are a form of fallen pony.
08,01CupcakeWarrior: so you're bon bon
NewDCD : Thank you, yours is awesome too :)
Wrek: rawrity?
Like orcs are fallen dark elves.

I need to stop drawing

Invi: i like here being a pony moar

Manearion: rest man. may you dream peacfully
I kinda tend to super speed draw when I'm home
Bronysith: ok ill check it out
Cobellanez: I know what you can draw... <.< >.>
Because I'm not a lot in the summer....
There is a lot of stuff I need to do, but I have no motivation to do. The good part is they are optional things
CCCP I just noticed Fakecadence's green magic and wonder why i didn't noticed it during the first view of the episodes ^^
05drawn anythign for me Manearion?<3
Yes...optional
Ah yes Teglo~
<3
i almost got scammed x.x
Manearion can draw? how good :|
I have some ideas....
Invi: i didn't either
I like where that thought was going FlareChaserxOctavia
this it what happens when you become obsessed with kittens @_@
05the plot is refined and without holes
I guess that's up to you to judge...
Wrek: Ive got an effin book I drew to show you....and I didnt get that kinda enthusiasm...just more cold silence......

The reason i am giving them out is because they formerly belonged to my father but he died just some few weeks back in a car accident when he was coming back from work. so i don't like to see them around me anymore because they make me to think of my father's dead and in addition is the fact that pets are not allowed in this new apartment and we have been given a maximum of 2 weeks to look MICKEY and DAISY a new home,that is why i will

Is someone making a character?
Nittany_Discord: then your lying..
/me throws infinite amount of cookies at Shizubirthday " Happy Birthday for like the 5th time tehe"

/me 11,01grabs ban stick
Fuliam: Wrek is drawing Rarity with a pretty necklace.
Invi: it would kill you guys but not Shizubirthday
Nittany_Discord: what you got that for?
Nittany_Discord: http://www.ernestcline.com/spokenword/npa.htm
Nittany_Discord: that'll explian it ^-^
Alicorn_Prince_Shane but when it's infinite, it would take every part of exsisting space and more
Kid_Cobalt: I wouldn't tempt him man.
What song is this?
/me sounds the Outside link ALARM!

Honestly Nittany_Discord I thought you'd have like a Ban Grenade or some other explosive

Nittany_Discord: cause its not porn.
Kid_Cobalt: yeah, but it still might not be appropiate for chat in general. Just giving you some forewarning
/me is killed by wub
Invi: cookies = wub therefore infinite amount of cookies = infinite amount of wubs
11,01Kid_Cobalt: Now you are tempting me.
You sir are talented.
otakon: It was only meant for nittany. If anyone else clicks it im not responsible for them.
Nittany_Discord: hmmm?
Is it wrong that I'm getting really creeped out right now?
Kid_Cobalt: that is what PM IS FOR DAMMIT!
However there is quite a bit of work that still neds doing.
Woodenfan: it depends what from
What tumblr is that?
The porn bit
Kid_Cobalt: you don't want to show it to anyone else? PM IT.

11,01Kid_Cobalt: If you meant it for me, then PM it.

Hai XAX
Hey hey hey XAX

obvious troll is obvious.
CupcakeWarrior: di u get confused by wut i said?

Clipped my McD's pinkie pie toy to my school bag today :o
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: What?
Been dreaming I've been waiting to fly with those great ponies
XAX: awesome
WHAT ARE THOSE MCDONALDS TOYS LIKE...wait what?
I really feel like drawing now but what I end up drawing monsters worse than Frankenstein
S3 has a special white pony in it
XAX: You're brave.
CupcakeWarrior: this yo dawg i heard u like space so we put space in ur space so in space u got space for your space so when u space you got space for your space in space
*are
Amazing Walt Disney quote:You're dead if you only aim for little kids.Adults are﻿ only kids grown up anyway.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I have no idea
haha CupcakeWarrior
Ok does anypony know if The Nostalgia Critic is a brony?
I love that quote
Guess what? I was talking to Lauren Faust last night and she said that I should do a guest voice on MLP!
CupcakeWarrior: http://www.lolbrary.com/content/89/come-at-me-po-18089.jpg
ask him Ponies47
Golakka: why it gotta be a white pony....
Ponies47: I think he is
:O
Release the inner children!
I'll say, those models are pretty good!
HWO DO I ASK!?! HOW DO I ASK!?!
does anyone remeber digimon lawl
me
/me releases the inner children.
Ponies47 He isn't unfortunately......he said that the clips he watched are cute but it's not his thing......however he added that if someone else is watching it, ''go on, i have no problem with it''
i watch it all the time
Ponies47: Not sure about the critic. Nostalgia Chick is definitely NOT.
okay brb guy, gonna take a shower
oh digimon oh how i love u
I can't think of anymore possibilities for S3 bingo - I posted the first 40, I stopped at 43
I liek ponies
what was that oscar wylde quote "When i grew up, I lost the fear of being childish"
It was awesome. I didn't get a single bit of hate, and some people even said they respect me more. Not because theyre bronies though. My mates don't even know what bronies are. They respect me for having the courage to clip a pink pony to my bag when I go to an all boys school.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: i have all the episodes in my PS3
Ponies47: good question, he made a video saying please enjoy shows for little kids, but idk. but i do think chuggaonroys a brony

twilight_sprinkler: no idea
CupcakeWarrior: That is... just plain lazy writing
RUN AWAY!
WUNN!
Sumica: I thought it was Xana pronounced Zana
NO ONE CAN STOP, THE SMOOZE!
Because it's suspensful Woodenfan.
Lambo: The show is really repetitive
I'm pretty sure bleach and ammonia doesn't have arms\
MahBoi777: cuz it seems kinda unimpressive..
Sumica: its lol
happy?
CupcakeWarrior: Then why are we watching this?
fluttershy is happy
this show was popular?
00,10they kept mustard gas in barrels at a school?
Lambo: Its good
twilight_sprinkler: lol, yes it is
pikoRarity: but the suspense is killed off by the ending being the same. IT GETS SO REPETITIVE. Someone should've died.
lol Sumica
Repetetive = good. Allright
couldnt find a .RAR file of the POD soundtrack so i downloaded a torrent lol
uhh duh its a skeleton :)
Math is INCREADIBLY complicated

TY Shizubirthday
I don't Sumica. I'm sorry
11,01That bus better not slow down to under 55 MPH.
I love how they are all just standing there, unshaken by the sudden acceleration to 80MPH
13i made the speed joke four scenes ago :3
13silly fillies
dang city folk and their drivin machines
Wow, they are SO calm for being on a out of control bus
88 MILES PER HOUR
GO BACK IN TIME
Washington and Franklin?

*BOOM*
00,10From the ep with fancy pants
Washington and Franklin, France. Seems Legit

90 kph. Not that that's MUCH better
I know the reference
11,01It's make a fun A movie.
ohhhhh
They should've gone back to 1955!
because a bag full of books is good thing to have against your face in a crash :)
00,10bag filled with paper seems like great padding
00,03Yeah, because books are VERY comfortable
i love using textbooks as an airbag
seat belts... on a buss
Dken2021: except they get their asses kicked in Lyoko ALL the time
13otakon: the mane four survive for four seasons, they have their close calls but they always pull through
bus driver gave up steering
hi Scoot-Scootaloo
he dies in that jump and the rest of the series is a dream :) the end
00,03oh hai! :)
13but that's why season 2 is so weak, they just kept going for 'YOU GONNA DIE YOU GONNA DIE' every episode
plot armor only works in the real world
woot, epic time
I had no idea a school bus could go 150 - where does that school get funding for a bus like that :D
So the whole series is a dream? Lyokoception!
dat music

Ponies47: did you make him watch smile smile smile smile?

00,10cheese it
FINALLY
55 mph is 88 kph. 110 is 176. Extrapolate as needed
Problem with this show is that every episode is basically an escort mission for Aelita.
OH GOD

Shizubirthday: Happy birthday!
"Pull over!"
yeah, THAT worked
62 mph
00,10lol wut, bus makes hard left every one slams in to the left side of the bus

superretroworld: I'VE TRYED EVERYTHING! NOW WHENEVER I EVEN WANNA SHOW HIM SOMTHING HE THINKS IT'S ABOUT PONIES! :'( I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN MAKE HIM A BRONY! :'(
I have to keep this bus going at 55 MPH or else it will explode!

Rejected transition for Code Lyoko: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO6CHeXik84

CupcakeWarrior: she's got psychic powers basically
Oh fuck, I just remembered the Video Blinky TM. Scarry Shit
Ponies47: We're all friends here.

Hai LucidDream

Never compare this awesome series to the movie
Sumica: I FUCKING CALLED IT. when I first watched it, remember? I said "why cant they bend metal, it's just earth" and then Toph did it and I'm like "I FUCKING KNEW IT!"
00,10what movie?
DONT TELL HIM
Shangalamadingdong's movie
THE MONSTROSITY IS TO TERRIBLE
/me 11,01goes underwater
goddammit
/me hugs Nittany_Discord
Dken2021: we never speak of it
Dat voice
nice voice
Hmm
/me 11,01hugs emangamer
emangamer: because they can't bend pure metal
otakon: they can
wait a minute, i just did a while ago :D
make sure the elderly are...taken care of
Dat voice is who you think it is.
00,10but it's not platnum
00,10it looks like pig iron
Hi. I am your friend. I am a COMPLETE DICK, but I am you friend as long as you kiss my ass. And by friend I mean I will opress you and beat you down but I will be polit3e about it when I am not being a dick. So, we are all friends.
emangamer: no, they can't. The metal has to be slightly impure for them to bend it.
Yes, IT'S CAVE JOHNSON.
platnum? Is the Ferengi around?
Sumica: I called it, didnt I?
otakon: nope, false
Kinda sums it all of.
Sumica: Toph hasn't invented metal bending yet
music night!
no, Ferengi use Latinum
Ooo SNAP
I smell a riot
emangamer: um, no you never watched the ep where Toph finally learned to Metal Bend have you?
well paint it gold then
metalbending uses worked metal
hi
dat courage
Metalbending doesn't exist yet. Also its a concept that has been slowly ruined since its creation. :/
00,10in korra they say metal benders cant bend platnum cause it's too pure.
eeyup
while earthbending uses unworked ore and rocks
...
Hey, sorry about last night....idk what came over me
Sumica: Which TICKS ME OFF.
RyunosukeKnT: yes
00,10Metal benders bend the impuritys in the metal
Metalbending can't use pure metals. So no gold mining
...
/me nods
Toph invented it in this series
wish there was one guy that yelled YEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!
otakon I still called it. there are very little things that are made of pure metal
nope
rocks contain a lot of iron
otakon: Did I sum him up properly?
I guess you were bored?
basically Sumica
Lol nope
they may take our lives.....
I was
I swear I'll be SO PISSED if it's raining outside :|
she used the impurities to bend the metal, so it makes sense
THEY MAY TAKE OUR LIVES
Kencolt: sum WHO up?
BUT THEY WILL NEVER TAKE
Because platinum is not a goddamn pure metal in most forms it appears in >_>
and zero fucks were given
lol
otakon: so it's pratically the same thing
OUR FREEDOOOOOOOOM
11,01Hooray for inspiration speeches!

I'll leave in an hour or so

08,01if any of you are interested inthe philosophy of AI, use this as a starting point: https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/lshapiro/web/Phil554_files/SEARLE-BDC.HTM
this kid again
00,10what's up?
big wurds
08,01i should say that i personally disagree with some of what Searle says in this
Ive heard Kiva's voiec in most animes I have watched
Sumica: You plan on showing any Ed Edd n' Eddy tonight?
00,10nope
The three core franchises of Super Robot Taisen are Gundam (U.C. timeline), Mazinger Z, and Getter Robo. If there were a western Super Robot Taisen, two of the core franchises has to be Megas and ExoSquad.
08,01because he doesn't take into account quantum effects
DeathStar: u drawing?
Gotta go
08,01an i think his fundamental premise of what a mind is is wrong
:(
laters, Pinkies4thWall
Smexy alien
Ah well
Not sure what the 3rd franchise should be.
fem predator?
Ah it's the Predator.
"Messy"
Bye Pinkies4thWall
Phase4: your right to question me. lol I dont know a lot but when i got malware issues or the ad problem. My cousin reset something put it in safe mode and installed some software. Anywho the thing he reset to get rid of the ads and stuff was called wind sock. Or you may be right and its probably calle winsock.
08,01but still, an interesting read -- you can agree or disagree
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: eeyup, more or less

08,01Phase4: you may need to fiddle manually after, if it's changed proxy settings
08,01and you may need to go and remove hidden drivers
SunderlandPony89: you've never seen 08th MS Team, have you?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I have troble drawing when a cat is 'helping' me that's why i havent started
WallDives: I have no idea what that is :P

Lyra and her duckie <3.

Irish_Pony: yfw the yoyo used to be a weapon.
Damn, that guy is awesome
He has a laser beam for everything.

2,14 It's the Nirvash V2
00,10yeah the movie one

2,14 it's used mostly in the movie, and only appears in the last episode of the actual show
2,14 and the movie can go to hell -_-
That must be from the movie
get 666 damage if you can go that low
00,10yep
Petrified_Discord: eeyup. THAT'S WHY EVERYPONY SHOULD STOOP TRYING TO FORCE ME TO GO TO BED! :[
Caramel: you no like the movie eh?
Only watched half the movie.
i never gave a damn about school pictures. i usually forgot to even wash m,y hair for them
*STOP
Didn't really like it.
00,10oh do we need to force some one to go to bed?
Ponies47: you are acting irrationally, you should get some sleep man.
Sumica: yep Ponies47
2,14 the movie is horrifically uncanon
/me defends Ponies47's right to stay up from everyone in chat :[
Never liked the series myself, but never saw anything I didn't really hate.
2,14 like...so uncanon it hurts
Caramel: so are most anime movies
idk y but this reminds me of megaman
Petrified_Discord: everyONE!!:O
HMMMM. Go to bed. Nah
I saw. Hence why I stoped wathing
fine stay up Ponies47 but if u feel liek shit to moz dont blame us
The siries whas awesome. The movie...
Caramel: oh jeez that sounds painful.
Most anime series' movies are there just for being over-the-top
Caramel: like the Dragonball Z movies, and the Fullmetal Alchemist movies and the Ranma 1/2 movies
2,14 otakon: if you saw Eureka Seven's finale, you'd understand
YAY! :)
O.>O?
2,14 because, despite being a great ending, it ends on a cliffhanger
2,14 so the fact they didn't finish it is >: (
mario_pony: What? Some of us aren't ponies (draconequus speaking :))
11,02I just pre-ordered my copy of Black Ops II today ^_^
i know jk
Caramel: you are shitting me.....it ends like friggin Inu Yasha?
11,02I got a poster :D
Hai SuperBrony64
Over kill 9000.
SuperBrony64: WHY!?
hey hey SuperBrony64
:O
dbz movies were one of the weakest things i saw.ever.
/me hugs SuperBrony64
otakon: cause he can
You ponies don't even wanna know how late I stay up on a NON-school night :P
2,14 never saw Inu Yasha
Good morning, everypony.
SuperBrony64: WHY YOU SUPPORT BAD GAMES?!
Nice, SuperBrony64.
SuperBrony64: YOU DARE PRE ORDER THAT ABONIMATION?!?!?!?!?!!?
Hey Malavolent!
I was hopeing they would finish it with the movie like they did with 00Gundam. But nooooooo.
11,02otakon: Anything else you want to bitch at me about? :3
SuperBrony64: guess what ... i have skylanders figures
lol :D
Caramel: the anime ends, and I mean straight up ends on a "To Be Continued"
I used to think I was the only one that hated CoD :D
otakon: WHY DO YOU SUPPORT BAD ANIME???
:O
ooohh
I just don't support IW and Activision. I'll rent it.
is youtube screwing up for anyone else
I CONTINUE TO FIIIGHT
the grab of death
SuperBrony64: How has your day been?
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!
I'm not really sharing your excitement SuperBrony64 but good for you.
She has a mighty grope
dead
:D
I don't care for CoD games anymore, but that's just me.
twilight_sprinkler: what bad anime? the fact that DBZ is STILL FUCKING AROUND says something. That fact that when most people think of anime, Goku pops up for them means something. It's not the best damn thing out there but dammit it's good enough to still be watched and enjoyed.
^
YO YO YO YO YO YO!
oooo dat wall rage
NOOOO!
twilight_sprinkler: let's see them still talk about Death Note and Code Geass in 20 years....
Ninjazz: Black ops 2 is made by treyarch and activision not shit ward and activision
no, DBZ still around only because still hasn't reached end of arc yet, what with fights taking 17 seasons
I know, Shane.
Ok are someponies getting mad in here?
otakon: I hate how there are like 20 dbz games when they are the same thing but with slightly better graphics
IW needs to go die their cod games a broken to shit
otakon: thats all you dbz fans can say. but news flash: popularity=/= quality
Man, multitasking the chat and xbox is fukken hard when I'm playing 1 vs 4 :D
Death Note? No, Gode Geass. Maybe
hen3ry: it's been over, ended with the Majin Buu saga
about 8 more veiws and i break a record of most veiws in 1 day <3
otakon, that, your DBZ line.
i bucking traded in Mw2 and mw3
ugh, I'm so tired

twilight_sprinkler: so? if it was so damn shitty it would have been forgetten like the other crap anime from back then
00,10Shame no gunbuster though

Om: You know nothing of sleep deprevation!
https://twitter.com/dannyimusic/status/205158579299303425
Ninjazz: Its funny cuse nothing it bothers you.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: challenge accepted
nah jk
00,10needs more buster beam!
Cowgirl?????????
:D
mario_pony: nothing is cuter than derpy hooves daughter
MOO
Renard: Dat trolling
otakon: the only reason people remember it is because it was a fad, not even because anything about the show in particular
Ninjazz: I suppose not.
I'm just kinda sick that I cannot share some treasures that I find because it's from a certain site
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Filly Fluttershy
Ninjazz: I once had a night where I did not sleep at all. Like, literally counted ceiling cracks all night
i say WTF
twilight_sprinkler: yeah, and Eureka 7 is so enlightened with it's crew of jackasses of the Gekkostate and Renton who's trying for the whiniest protagonist ever award since Shinji.
SuperBrony64: Theres something important that you must know! I could save the world!
Sylandest: That sounds pretty bad...
mario_pony: meh dinkys cuter
Sylandest: Ugh, I hate those nights.
Sylandest: Insomnia?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: :O
PEOPLE!

twilight_sprinkler: are you kidding me? really? A FUCKING FAD? hwo the HELL do you get that?
Tefacehuggah: people where? <_< >_>
ssssssssssooooooooo ded
EXPLOSION!
ALL THE PONIES ARE CUTE! :[
twilight_sprinkler: oops, wrong example then. I'm tired atm
seriously I know the rules, I wouldn't something suggestive or gory
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: you're dead to me!!
otakon: i remember growing up during those times, it was a fad
BEUTIFULL!
What did I say about the caps, Ponies47?
otakon: everyone was like "dbz dbz dbz", it was just a stage
twilight_sprinkler: well, I guess you'll say the same thing about MLP then
Ninjazz, Everlasting_Joy: It only happened one night, only once. After that, never again. Dunno what caused it, but somehow I was fine the next day
mario_pony: daww dats cute
and each time I explain my reasoning I get ignored
Sylandest: Atleast it didn't happen again. :)
Ninjazzz: Sorry. Flutterage moment. I get em alot :$
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zh1NgPmYlUQ/T7wu6x97YzI/AAAAAAAAqqA/4rKTXtCtWJI/s1600/3.JPG
otakon: the point is that popularity=/=quality, in fact, its often the opposite
/me hands Ponies47 a blanket
Sylandest: Still. . .
when im bored i monky
All ponies are cute. Especialy Trixie right Ninjazz
Ninjazz: indeed. I always get plenty of rest, hehe
otakon: mcdonalds is popular. what about the food quality?
Irish_Pony: D'AAAAAAAAAAAWW <3
Ponies47: Fluttershy doesn't rage ALL the time. :|
otakon: dbz is like that, its junkfood
Nope.avi Still not sleepy
:D!
Om: If you say Trixie one more damn time...
Everlasting_Joy: have no fear, I always get good rest. I also don't have insomnia or sleep disorders, hehe. I'm perfectly healthy :)
and about dragonball
twilight_sprinkler: just, I'm done. I'm done trying to defend classic anime from you. You don't like. The point is if IT IS THE UTTER COW SHIT YOU DESCRIBE IT AS THERE WOULD BE NO INKLING OF IT NOWADAYS GODDAMMIT
the original is way better
Dragonball Z was yelling the anime
with hair power
2,14 okay...calm down folks...
Ninjazz: I'll say it two more times if youd like :|
otakon: thats false logic
:| brb
lol, broken links on eqd
/me hands Ponies47 milk
2,14 just watch the robots beat the shit out of each other
Caramel: who?
Caramel: im perfectly calm
CrimsonPhoenix: Nice summary :
Caramel: lol k
:D
It's alright, otakon. I like dbz. One of first animes.
Sylandest: I didn't take it as you have insomnia, I took it as a one night thing, but I hate those kind of nights.
Thank you
twilight_sprinkler: YOU DON'T FUCKING LIKE IT, I GET IT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT UTTER SHIT SO STOP FUCKING SAYING THAT WHENEVER IT FUCKING COMES UP.
Ninjazz: I gotta stop watching the Best Night Ever I've seen it at least 10 times :P
otakon: dude calm down, youre getting val mad
http://twitter.com/tarastrong/status/204349135497871360
Ponies47: Or get some sleep.
Caramel as long as i can get drunk ill be fine :P
otakon: why cant you talk calmly
twilight_sprinkler: yeah, I know. tired
2,14 I'm not mad, just telling everyone to keep it cool
otakon: calm ur guam nam farm ya palm and ur neighy-palm
Om: No. Don't even say it once.
brain is fuzzy atm
wow otakon
Val ain't even mad
Everlasting_Joy: indeed, hehe. Fortunately, I'm always unconcious before long. I'll bore myself or trick myself into sleeping
GabeMoist: and then live show
Irish_Pony: Oh you :).
Ninjazz: I will refrain from saying Trixie anymore at times.
I said I'm not tired! :[ Plus I'm a 14 year old clot why the buck would I need milk?
see otakon im proving my point with logic
Everlasting_Joy: wat??
Ninjazz: trixie
Om: I'll believe that when I see it.
Irish_Pony: "as long as I can get drunk."
/me slaps Shane a gundam
Ninjazz: Trixie
Ninjazz: I doubt even then.
/me is immune
otakon: if you simply like the show, then say so, dont deny its quality if you cant prove it
oh god perfect picture
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1337749398060.jpg
Everlasting_Joy well your name says it all :P
CupcakeWarrior: Et tu, Cupcake? D:
/me slaps Ninjazz with a foam hand saying trixie is stupid
I think everypony is having to much fun trying to make me go to bed so.... I'm still not going to bed :P
twilight_sprinkler: what logic? the only logic is that popularity=/=good, however popularity does not carry something for 20 goddamn years. If DBZ was so cow shit bad as you think of it, it would have been forgotten by now.
Irish_Pony: :D True.
Ninjazz: What's with that Trixie thing?
00,10am I gonna have to start seprateing ponies?
Sumica: first otakon
Malavolent: Oh nothing... I just hate her and all.
So, how far is this from the end now?
You could start with Ninjazz x Trixie
im not even capsing
Ninjazz: Wow, why?
2,14 Mama Sumica is putting her foot down ;)
FALCON PAWNCH!
Malavolent: Cause she's an arrogant bitch and people love her for it.
YAY! Mama Sumica! :D
twilight_sprinkler: YOU do not like, you are a minority in that case. I grew up with it, it's fun to watch and entertaining. Hell, it's practically a soap opera with fists.
Om: Waaaaay toooooo late, my friend. She's already taken.
Caramel: Dont let Mama Sumcia take me beer :'(
00,10So help me I will turn this stream righ........hey wait . wth Caramel
Ninjazz: I don't exactly love her but I feel sorry for her.
Ninjazz: funniest moment once when Sumica was streaming me2
2,14 <3
otakon: i can understand if you like it, but i cant agree that its good, which is what im proving
Ninjazz: Its not to late, its never to late.
Ninjazz: i said in chat wise and powerful Sumica and he happened to be talking on stream and he scoffed at wise
There's the falcon pawnch!
Malavolent: Aye. She lost everything. Sad. But that's why I hate her.
Caramel: Why arent you attacking the actual boss?
Ninjazz: sumi sayd " pfft wise"
^ made my day
otakon: and the reason why its remembered is because it was a fad, a lot of people grew up on it together, hence its remembered
otakon: http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1337749398060.jpg
Malavolent: Not why*
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: ninja'd
that's exactly how you look right now
twilight_sprinkler: wut?
2,14 cupcakewarrior: because his shield is still up
CupcakeWarrior: Picking off the little guys can be a great strategy.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: nvm:P
2,14 so attacking him is pointless when there's trash around him
6_9 twilight_sprinkler
Ninjazz: Yeah, she learned her lesson. I'd still love to see her in the future, maybe a little wiser.
So you have to kill everyone else first?
Om: Unfortunately for you, she really is taken. So, no.
Caramel: remove shield by killing his army?
Lyra aint even scared
eating nachos before bed is probably a bad idea
LSD strike?
Ok. The next pony who's says anything or does anything to make me go to bed I don't know what I'm gonna do. But I'll do somthing! :[
Ninjazz: In the end, does it really matter?
Malavolent: I'd personally like to NEVER see her again.
2,14 it didn't specify how his shield goes down
O.>O?
Caramel: u should try Techno kitten adventures
2,14 so I can only hope it's by defeating his enemies
anime lich king
Om: Well, you know. I had to fall to lose it all.
dat long attack
otakon: stop.capsing.calm.down
Is this the final boss?
Yep
Kandarihu: on of them
otakon: cant we talk like civilized ponies?
and only 10 damages will be done :P
10?
What the hell.
Ninjazz: Now your catching on. xD
00,10lol watch the shield requires you to overload it with damage
So this IS the final mission?
2,14 hey look! Giant robots! They're fighting things!
We are so random! :P
Caramel: ok, i cant get otakon to talk calmly, il lstop
sounds like robot wars
Om: Shush, you.
Sumica: ahhh, I thought it might be that, but wasnt sure...I hate that strategy
This game is intense
Caramel: You realize this is based off an anime, may I suggest "what cat videos did you see on the 'net today?"
Caramel: meh i got whiskey ill be fine....just keep rapping those robots
twilight_sprinkler: dont worry otakon is very opinonated
Ninjazz: That's what she said, as she faded away.
00,10knee axe?
twilight_sprinkler: just stop bringing it up. You insult one of my favorite things, 'kay? don't bring up DBZ whil you are here,that's all YOU have to do.
12:08 AM gonna hit the hay? Nope.avi
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: yeah, hes emotional as hell too
twilight_sprinkler: dats our otakon for u
Om: Good. Do you honestly think I like her in any sense of the word? I hate her. Her fans. Her pics. Her fanon. Everything.
Everlasting_Joy, I saw videos of the most adorable cats today
I nearly died
Those yellow robots have rainbow cutie marks. Awesome.
GabeMoist: Show me please.
00,10twilight_sprinkler, stop antagnoseing. otakon stop rageing
Wait, can't not when something is streaming GabeMoist.
Ninjazz: Oh, you have looked for her pics then? What kind?
that's a double negative, so I can
so there
Ninjazz: who's?
Sumica: im not doing it on purpose, you know how easy it is to get him roiled up :P
GabeMoist: I'll take your word for it. How cute was the kitty?
Om: The ones on EqD where Seth likes to cuddle with Trixie doll.
his*
Overkill much????????
I nearly died
Seth loves Trixie
Sheesh finally everypony stopped trying to force me to go to bed. :)
nicely done, Caramel!
Ninjazz: So who is your fav pony then.
Badass look, check!
Ninjazz: do not talk about that sick buck
2,14 twilight_sprinkler: drop it now or I'm going to start kicking. I don't care which side, but if anyone continues this I'm going to have to act
Om: You're kidding me, right?
Caramel: i already stopped
Caramel: i stopped when i said i would
Caramel: twilight_sprinkler stopped otakon still going
Ninjazz: Yes, that is why I asked.
/me sighs
2,14 and yet here you are *still* talking
2,14 so stop
2,14 and just watch the damn robots
Caramel: stop...talking?
Caramel lies, he doesn't kick, he stabs with a trident
I have the scars to prove it
2,14 stop arguing with a mod when they tell you to cut it out
I love this site. :$
So... You could say that he is king of the sea ponies?
ok im gonna try and calm the chat down....
Hoho
Aye, Everlasting_Joy. Ain't other one like it.
twilight_sprinkler: its like telling a care bear to stop caring
Everlasting_Joy: Aye, agreed! I enjoy every minute I'm in here
Time to play...Answer that random question!!!!!!!!!!
*Zips muzzel shut* mfmfmffmmf

In my headcanon, the air DOES have a taste, but we got used to it in the womb so we forgot what it tastes like
/me dances
2,14 except you don't breath air in the womb
The air does have a flavor, and it is based on what is in the air
/me hugs DeathStar

Lets see... ther was this japenese move on last week that was too japanese for my interest
Phase4: where would u recommend for me to dl s1 of pokemon and digimon english one

Uninteresting stream. Whenever someone streams the chat and only the chat.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, piratebay?
Caramel, can we watch the live show to celebrate your victory?
2,14 so glad you're willing to voice it duskstarshimmer -_-
Caramel You know i love you
SPAAAAACE
<3
why would you wanna watch the english digimon Alicorn_Prince_Shane? its better in japanese
Phase4: TO PIRATEBAY AWAY
Caramel, http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/Haircut.mp3 put headphones on and listen to this
and on occaion I also tolerate
and now for flutterstep ^__^
Midnight_Tempest: cause i grew up with the english ones
Midnight_Tempest: English version is more nostalgic
HP almost halfway gone!
Midnight_Tempest: im reliving the golden days
How many attacks does he get?
2,14 this isn't good
screw nostalgia... the japanese one is better and still gives nostalgia
I dont see why people fight over what language a show is in. I mean its the same damn show no matter what
MahBoi777: don't junx it...
jinx*
ouch Caramel
So what was on stream anyway? was it that robot chess in space thing?
derp.
oh no
dam..
Shit
damn... 5k
That... was close.
Rain, ever see the Ghost Stories anime dub?
we show it here sometimes
2,14 and I'm near out of spirit points
RUN AWAY!
wow, he's been hit for over 30 minutes now
DuskStarshimmer: robot wars on steroids and acid
2,14 which means no more "save my ass" abilities
Uh oh
shit
Now things are going to get desparate...
This could be the end
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, So it is that robt tile thing is space?
You can do it, Val!

Hmm, The only giant robot game I actually like are mechwarrior/mechassault come to think of it.
Silly SB

its not even a stream its some boring game
SuperBrony64: Why would you want apple? D:
lol SB is so silly :3
Go to bed SuperBrony64, I lost IQ points reading that
Speaking of the dentist

g'night Mignight_Tempest
Caramel ? No hard feeling rite? I would hate to have unintentionally offfended a BS streamer
G'night Midnight_Tempest
dat 6k
Oh boy...
this will not be pretty
This ain't good.
Sea Lyra is best robot on acid steroids
here is a good strategy to not make a streamer mad DuskStarshimmer... dont say anything about the stream other that 'What are we watching'... it tends to be the only good thing to say
its ok you are forgiven ^_^
i'm guessit.s count how many mechs you have. that's now your number of attacks :/
More dakka!
A good proverb my older children shows taught me seems appropriate
ravecrocker... dont talk bad about the stream, if you find it boring go somewhere else... and with that, i sleep
who is forgiven for what, ravecrocker?
dat birthday
If you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything at all.
eeeeeyup

Alicorn_Prince_Shane, no such thing as too much love, unless you can observe negetive consequences as a result
GabeMoist lol, cause I mentioned Hex silly :3
11,02You know, everyone is entitled to their own free opinion, but voicing hate about something that isn't constructive is both rude and uncalled for. At least on my own behalf, if you love a stream, it's great that you voice your enjoyment of it. It makes us happy and continue to enjoy streaming for you all. If you hate a stream, we can't force you to like it, but if you wish to voice
57k health
11,2it, go ahead and do it, but be constructive about it and say what can be done to make it better for you (preferably in PM). If nothing can be done about it and you're still unhappy, sorry, but just leave. We want you to stay, but if you're that unhappy, it's best to just leave and come back another time when something you like is being streamed.
Dat SuperBrony64
Superbrony64!! :D
Holy crap Im drowning!
PartyCannon: Om nom nom, that is all.
Liek a boss
...I think I'm falling into depression......

Rare games always had so much stuff in them to collect
You mean good platforming?
Nuu xD
