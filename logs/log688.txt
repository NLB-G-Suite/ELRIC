omg ;(
thank you
CRAAAAAAAWLING IIIIIIIIN MY SCAAAAAAAAAAAAALES
don't cry Spike
I wouldn't
I mean it had it's bits
08,01wait a second
05,15Like I said earlier. Interest in the subject matter probably helps a ton
We just steal eggs and enslave dragons, we don't give a fuck
Saturn: I'll wait two seconds
I just cannot get invested in "He has to get over a stutter"
Alright, yeah, half the film was awkward stuttering.
purple scale = purple mane
Celestia is spikes moms
Tear Ducts => Dragons can cry
you've already seen two of em
08,01as confirmed when he says "you're not mommy"
08,01but
Saturn: why would he, she didnt birth him
08,01he's been raised by her since he's an egg
Quest
I had a theory that she "fertilized" that egg...
00,10polka dots
Saturn: he's not a fucking moron
Saturn: More like an adopted son, I presume
GASP!
Saturn: See, when I heard of this ep, I thought he'd be looking for his biological parents.
dat sammich
I tolerate Great Britain
Saturn: Dragons probably arent raised by mothers
08,01ASoftFluffyThing: but he'd still count her as "mommy"
>Rainbow Dash
though I like some of their TV
>scared
Aprons are manly
there is NOTHING wrong with aprons
cutesy wootsy
Rejected
Saturn: its not like he popped out of nothing
I think Faust says Celestia raised him at first, and I take her word as canon until shown otherwise in the show.
rarity not helping
You're givingg the fanfic writers material Rarity...
I wear aprons now. Aprons are cool.
Aprons are awesome
layin down da law
Maybe dragons are on their own since birth, like sea turtles
TIME OUT!
slap stick from a stick slap
We know
ya
Saturn: yeah he doesn't see Twilight as that... wow that is kind of sad
nnnnaughty
"We know. . ."
dont die!
He also doesn't have a father figure, but thats not really the ponies fault since the gender ratio is like 1:100
Saturn, and then Spike grew up to be like the dragons in this episode?
KWEST
We're gonna follow him, right?

She did a lot on this..
all hail the creator@

05,15dat bass
PPG not the heroes Townsville needs, but the heroes Townsville deserves
and this song... is intresting
Genndy Tartakovsky did the animation direction
/me bops along to the song
11,01No. I only accept cash.
Right. I'm gonna check to see if I have a notebook somewhere...
from this song to this
ok, that was fun, PONY TIME
Tartakovsky is an animation genius.
05,15Bass guitar is best guitar
No credit for Craig? It is sad day...
05,15Dubstep bass is not real bass
I really enjoyed the aesop at the end. It's hard to fit in when people think that you're something terrible that you're not. But it's important not to give in to the stereotypes.
Craig/10
I was going to order the derpy toy yesterday. (IT WAS IN FUCKING STOCK!) But I decided to wait a day...:'(
*Black
He pretty much defined the contemporary era of animation.
11,01How am I supposed to feed myself then?
I can only wish though
I mean, Craig Mccracken.
oh, yeah. Totally have at least two of them.
yeah
I wish we had time to do a ppg night sometime

I'm sorry but Rarity looks off in that outift
MY EYES!!!!!!!!!!!!
15! And 4
She looks trashy
>signed up 15 flyers
Rarity is a bitch in this episode.
>only time for 14
she's still my favorite.
Instead of a lord you would have a Queen
*factorial
awwww bs
inb4 the offspring
If she cut back on the lipstick and eyeshadow she'd be okay I guess
and Rarity ISN'T a bitch here. We've ALL been caught up in popularity contests before
XD
Why is it people hate on Rarity when an episode brings up HER character flaws, but when the other ponies do it, they're just being well rounded characters?
The fact that Rarity is there is making her humiliate herself though.
TREASON !
She's afraid of Rarity outshining her.
iccarus....man
and now for the moment that convert most people into the Bronydom
I Was one of the provinces in a independence day act.

This is not a good show.
