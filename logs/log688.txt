Bye, here is a whooooa for Sumi
This is a great movie, not one you'd normally think of as showing here.
I'm th doctor.
05,15Fuck tomatoes. Though give me more onions
GilDash: um, it was chicken tikka and rice, from tesco
Also, tomatoes are fruit...
>not liking tomatoes
flutterbutt: Did it have sauce?
:O
Tomatoes are toes
GilDash: yes
TheMaster: I was quite surprised
Bitch please, I could eat cherry tomatoes all day long.
TheMaster: too many queens in the mlp series. need kings
Potatoes are poes
pony_5363: eeeeeeewww
05,15We need to go deeper
Ghosties: this guy
Ghosties: o u

I've pretty much outgrown the whole "Picky Eater" phase when I was VERY young.

05,15His brother abdicated the throne and now he is the king. STill can't talk
flutterbutt: Right, well it wasn't just tikka then. Tikka is just the way chicken is prepared with spices, and usually left to marinade for 24 hours. The sauce will be masala, so together, chicken tikka masala. :)
04Ew
Just end already
what's the difference between Kethcup and Catsup?
I know luna :)
Ghosties: ah whatever, just making a point

Technically it could be over

Is the B movie inglorious basterds?
Neville Chamberlain has less courage than ME for goodness sake

flutterbutt: Nope. British, with a love of curry. :)
final battle
Churchill was right DRINK!

I thought B Movie was "Powerpuff Girls"
Unless you live in the states and you still used celcius haha
Hey sumica in that movie heres a question for you: Would you even dare to sit in a throne chair in that movie?
Final rap battle
Actually Chamberlain did a great job. He bought time so that england could rearm itself.
This
he was a goddamn genius if i remember correctly
TheMaster: Powerpiff Girls.

Gaston: YES
I was throughly impressed with that. I shall be watching again later today. :)
Kammerjunk, the fast goes on until the election. The only thing I'll break it for is the S3 premier. I held off on fasting in fact out of concern that it might be before.
give us the powerpuffpls
Fucking Beethoven...such a classic.
It was a great movie as-is, but it would have been even MORE entertaining if the king was getting speech therapy from the dread pirate Barbossa. :D
After the ponies, silly bronies.
when Celestia make her speech

Kandarihu: Pardon, election?
SuperSanjitenks1989: later on man, probably around 9:30 or so

CRAAAAAAAWLING IIIIIIIIN MY SCAAAAAAAAAAAAALES
Deathwing's salad days.
otakon: I think there is a fic about that
don't cry Spike
OJ: Spike, you are NOT the father
I wouldn't
I mean it had it's bits
08,01wait a second
pony_300: He was probably upset that Rarity wasn't "appreciating" the qualities he wants her to see in him and was effectively friendzoning him.
We just steal eggs and enslave dragons, we don't give a fuck
but really, it was Oscar bait pure and simple
yay existiantial crisis!
I just cannot get invested in "He has to get over a stutter"
NOT EVERY BOOK IN YOUR LIBRARY HAD DRAGONS IN IT TWILIGHT
Buytoast: THIS ORANGE HAVE NOT TAAAAAAAAASTE
08,01so spike doesn't think of twilight as his mother
too rare my ass
Alright, yeah, half the film was awkward stuttering.
purple scale = purple mane
Celestia is spikes moms
Tear Ducts => Dragons can cry
Spazturtle: please God I hope you're wrong
you've already seen two of em
but nah, i'm only hitting on otakon
05,15I love history. I love Great Britain. So it all works out.
08,01as confirmed when he says "you're not mommy"
08,01but
According to Lauren Faust, Celestia raised Spike
08,01he's been raised by her since he's an egg
Quest
otakon: yeah just joking
I had a theory that she "fertilized" that egg...
00,10polka dots
WHAT
But then, dragon came in princessian
what!!!
08,01so does he consider himself as not having a mother?
GASP!
dat sammich
I tolerate Great Britain
08,01ASoftFluffyThing: but he'd still count her as "mommy"
>Rainbow Dash
though I like some of their TV
sandvich
>scared
Sandvich
SafariMonkey: It's more of a surrogate mother or big sister/ little brother relationship.
Aprons are manly
there is NOTHING wrong with aprons
what does a duck do after its hatch?
SO MOIST AND DELISHUS
cutesy wootsy
Rejected
I think Faust says Celestia raised him at first, and I take her word as canon until shown otherwise in the show.
rarity not helping
You're givingg the fanfic writers material Rarity...
I wear aprons now. Aprons are cool.
Aprons are awesome
the first one it sees is the mom
layin down da law
AJIsAwesome: o.O
damn twi
Maybe dragons are on their own since birth, like sea turtles
TIME OUT!
What happened to Season 1 Rainbow Dash that wasn't scared of dragons in Dragonshy
slap stick from a stick slap
otakon: Admittedly, that pink frilly thing was ultra-girly.,
SafariMonkey: SOrry. :D
surro... what
goddamn purple magic, calm down there
08,01but then, that's really sad, because he doesn't really have a mother figure who *he* sees as a mother figure
DocSane: true...
LunasGuard: this implies that this show has logic
You see, Rarity doesn't know how to deal with the "Spike likes me" thing, so she just ignores it
CrimsonPhoenix: There went 100's of them
We know
Dashie laying on her back the third time in this episode
ya
nnnnaughty
CrimsonPhoenix: Season 1: One dragon. This episode: HUNDREDS.
"We know. . ."
dont die!
Rainboe Dash is best nut
He also doesn't have a father figure, but thats not really the ponies fault since the gender ratio is like 1:100
KWEST
We're gonna follow him, right?
LunasGuard: or that dragons in this show rely soley on instinct
Nutty=Stupid, almost fatal stunts.
@OJ You are now OJSimpson to us

LunasGuard: what, no logic?
Spike is literally Dragonborn
DAT STRAW HAT <3
By Celestia's Beard!
05,15But those of us there watching the auction were just like ".....wut"
Wait, maybe this takes place before AFiD when Cranky was still on his search.
hiya Red
Hey, it's the dragon from Dragonshy!
LunasGuard: well, this show has logic, but its mostly cartoon logic
@AJIsAwesome You mean Mugiwara
I wonder if Red let it on that he was shown up by a little yellow opny
but hey, PPG movie is next and that film kicks 12 different kinds of ass
pish posh?
Douchebags - dragon form
Crackles
PISH POSH
a FABULOUSIDON
AJIsAwesome: It's fine. I just had it open in pidgin, and was about to log off when a little notification box appeared, saying "It's more of a surrogate mother or big sister/ little brother relationship." It was confusing to say the least.
but the rainbow one kicked me :(
sEEMS LEIT
cowvarkian: yeah yer right
Seems legit
dragonbros
Did twilight say ass?
http://ponybot.net/?i=2292

08,01see! they do have mommies!
ERMAGERD DREGGUNS
Is it just me or is the dragon's art style much different?
trust me, the movie is pretty different from the show in terms of tone, but it's honestly one of the best Super Hero movies I've ever seen.

No eyelashes => male
fluttercry: basicly

more importantly, you like something that other people like?
That blue fire must be hot as .....king
Why are they all male? is there a female dragon?
MOLESTED, yes...
lol letter
:D
fluttercry: well teenage dragons apparantly
cowvarkian: I haven't been using ubuntu recently, and had forgotten that Pidgin used notifications for messages (otherwise it's just program info stuff) so it was a bit confusing
Dr_Fumbles: somewhere
if a pony is my love does that make me part pony? :3
You dolts just seem to think criticism means I hate everything.
HAW HAW
05,15If it's different from the show then that already gives it some points
and then Celestia shows up
Dr_Fumbles: There were no female Orcs
Why are the younger dragon humanoid and the older ones look full dragon
and thren Celestia came and murdered them
Most Frat boys don't have the ability to breath fire, fly, and devour princesses. :P
inb4 sent to the moon

05,15criticism is good. I have criticisms for plenty of things I love

I don't know, I can't really remember last week.
No Namby Pamby is the paper editor

Yeah I think celestia should have shown up in the epp
That HERESY must not be tolerated!
As if Celestia is a threat to dragons.
poni centipede
J_E_Smith71: you're right!
OJ: well, then are the mothers just feminine males?

"Spike's pen pals with the most powerful creature in the land who controls celestial bodies. HOW PATHETIC!"
Everlasting_Joy: she RAISES THE GODDAMN SUN

"Dear Princess Celestia, Today I learned my race sucks and is inferior to ponies. Sincerely, Spike"

There's also the fun fact that in nature? Birds -abandon- eggs if they pick up new smells.

I totally expected to them to beat the shit out of Garble and all them. And they just flee instead.
the end
and then it died
D'aaaaww...
I felt a little gypped.
this was a good episode, but god i hate spike
powerpuff girls time!
cowvarkian, at the end of the episode she admited that she was friend with the five mares "ruining" the garden party
I loved this epiosde when it aired and I still love it today.
not the best epiwode
I go on funnyjunk and 4chan
Ryunosuke: i was just think that
AlienWarhead: well it would be too dangerous to try to return it now by himself. They can't teleport back and the predator's probably layed low when the dragon's were flying overheard, which is why Spike had no issues walking through the Everfree.
Poor phoenix, dead with Tank and Pipsqueak

Get out of that popcorn bag!

So, no lottery means old intermission.

Ah, the good ol' intermission.

It was Tolver that chose that ep right?
He act's like a little boy....
spike is best pony
fluttercry: now you've cause mass whining
THAT'S RIGHT, we had the lotto on Friday last week.
sort of. A bird WILL abandon a nest if it's destroyed though, which...the phoenix nest definitely was.
Ryunosuke: Tomorrow, it alters from week to week
... and well.. he is
We alternate.
come ahn
give us film
ah kk
K_A: ok, thank you, that's reassuring ^^
srsly
otakon he could have tried to find the nest again, but it would be dangerous and the parents are probably gone.
Cute Derpy :3
MrBen: Lotto switches back and forth from week to week
05,15Obligatory +m
oh god whqt if cupcakes was on this
...Yup, those were the days...
Lolz
00,03So what is u everypony?
6_9
J_E_Smith71: i don't get it
birds don't care about unhatched eggs.. go watch discovery....
00,10the alternating lotto is a throw back from the old way we did it
00,03up*
ohai Scoot-Scootaloo :3
Where was Gondor when obligatory +m?
Scoot-Scootaloo: u is a letter. Up is a direction
Shit dads coming switch tabs.
00,03aside from dropout rates...
Scoot-Scootaloo: it's an evening
how does one alternate a lotto?
Scoot-Scootaloo, the price of gas
>.>
that was silly
suddenly MakerDusk :o
to be honest
J_E_Smith71: Yeah, I realize we alternate weeks, but I didn't realize that we showed the old intermission on the days we don't have the lotto.
OH
00,10back in the day we randomly pulled names from the channle list and just had them pick a movie on the spot
p4ngya: magic
p4ngya: by rigging it, duh :p
I love this intermission more than the new one
^
p4ngya: I mean the day we do the lotto alternates
Sumica: Id like that
its simple logic. The birds can't do much to defend an egg if a predator is insistent. Its easier to just make a new egg than be eaten and lose the egg anyway
this takes me way way back
ooohhhhh
MakerDusk: i was able to sleep-listen in Philosophy today :3
EY LOOK ITS DA INTERMISSION
HEY*
MrBen: It's something they started doing a few weeks ago
05,15New Intermission is best intermission
00,10so it changed form week to week to alow euro only viewers a chance to pick too
friggin heck
Sumica: you might not like my choice
CrimsonPhoenix: *^^
MakerDusk: I havent :p
fluttercry: Agreed.
J_E_Smith71: Ah. Wasn't aware of that.
i love the intermission stuff

Sumica: Nonsense. otakon Ships With Everything, remember?
Sumica: dont you mean otakon x everything
05,15ahh otakon shipping....brings back memorie
Sumica: The 20 minutes in Shizuka's intermission was also to give you guys more time to run the lotto in case of rerolls right?
theres something wrong with the intermission
Otakon shipping? I thought that was a kickable offence? XD
goddammit

You know if Lauren had done FiM before this she probably would have snuck in ponies in here (Like they did with Jigglypuff a couple times)
I was off a moment, but let me say if it hasn't been stated that if the Internet became as permeated as it is now less than a decade when this showed (god time passes), this would've basically been what MLP is now.

8/10. It started weak at the beginning because it felt like they were just showing off the fact that it was a movie. Also, I kinda prefer a movie that starts a new adventure rather than recounting the origin or background story. But this pulls it off well, especially at the turning point into awesomeness when Mojo's plan reaches fruition.

Evil_Spike Craig helped design Discord
I really enjoyed the aesop at the end. It's hard to fit in when people think that you're something terrible that you're not. But it's important not to give in to the stereotypes.

Dr_Fumbles: I credited him. :S

WHAT CAN I SAY? the animation is awesome, the soundtrack kicks ass, the story is engaging, BUT It can drag for TOO LONG....IT ISN'T until 30 minutes when we finally see the plot going full speed ahead......and it isn't until 1 hour when the action finally begins..........ASIDE from that, the girls are great, Mojo is a great TRAGIC character, and for what it holds up, it's a decent Introduction for the PPG

Hey Sumica, fluttercry since you guys are eliminating eps, how will you handle Season 3 next ep cycle? Right now you have an even 52, playing 2 each BMN. BUT....
Element of Generosity...
Sumica: Air balloon passed through it.
show us the factory plz
…with Season 3 you’ll have an uneven 65. With you eliminating episodes, you’ll have three left at the end of the cycle. Will you guys have to do an “odd” week and show three eps so you can show them all, or will one episode not get shown?
fluttercry She can't be perfect so one flaw is being lazy
then somepony got hit by that jackhammer and died
and commence the ogling
yeah, just because you're not indoctrinated like everypony else has to mean you're a failure. if you wanna judge a person or pony by their scholar achievements then why do you not tell Einstein that he's a failure

Uggh, did you look in a mirror Rairty? :S
Instead of a lord you would have a Queen

I have to wonder what music Rainbow hadplaned

awwww bs
go back to your home on whore island. That is what i hear when i see rarity here
inb4 the offspring
BONK!
Biggysweet: Dat ron burgendy.
If she cut back on the lipstick and eyeshadow she'd be okay I guess
Rarity, do you mind if I RIP YOUR WINGS OFF??!?!!
So much for being the element of generosity, she should have just taken Rainbow Dash's feelings into consideration, instead of humiliating her like this.
fluttercry: no hard feelings <3
and Rarity ISN'T a bitch here. We've ALL been caught up in popularity contests before
05,15But you know what. No matter how bad Rarity is in this, it's still not as bad as Mysterious Mare Do Well
fluttercry: no, they're not. you don't need to have an education and/or a job to have a decent life. actually it's a bit contradictory. if you want to live the life of your dreams you must be above everyone else and excel at what you do. being an indoctrinated government boxed person only limits you :)
fluttercry: agreed
XD
ASSASSIN!!!!
Rex_Ivan: Yeah no, I never have. She's a bitch.
Why is it people hate on Rarity when an episode brings up HER character flaws, but when the other ponies do it, they're just being well rounded characters?
The fact that Rarity is there is making her humiliate herself though.
Rex_Ivan: i havent, simply because i nver participated in one :P
TREASON !
She's afraid of Rarity outshining her.
iccarus....man
and now for the moment that convert most people into the Bronydom
I Was one of the provinces in a independence day act.
Not dark but beautiful
just of that
me excluded
fluttercry I actually like the Mysterious Mare Do-Well costume :(
I. AM. RARITY!!!
What wasn't Derpy in the competition?
Twilight_sprinkle you have been maybe isolated too much then,
Rex_Ivan: but i agree though, its understandable
What is this?
wings: fak u rd we do what we want
Too close to the sun
I like the hero episode :P
Is Guiles Theme the best song for this scene or is there another one like you got the touch
05,15CloverMuffins Because so many artists are having fantastic lives free from poverty. It may be boring, but having a stable and comfortable life is worth more than following dreams
derpy loves it
nope
YES! FALL RARITY, FALL!!!
Canadian_Brony: I really like the mare-do-well costume, its good.

best day ever
green pony
Rex_Ivan: i understand that.
there
she lost her head
Yeah, but there's like a place where competitors go to watch it.
she wasn't herself
AND TOMORROW NO ONE GAVE A SHIT
fluttercry: that's why i said it's not very creative. i'm not saying it's wrong to live like that, because it's not, but you shouldn't judge a person or itc a pony about their choices in life. Dashie dropped out of school yet still is the best flier ever. she took matters into her own hooves ;)
D'aaaaaaaaaaawwww Rainbow teared up a bit
"you saved my life" Death is canon
They don't go into the stands to watch it.
fangirl moment
fluttercry: i dont know if i would want to live a boring monotonous life of doing something i dont like
Heh it's funny Sumi comments on how much RD is able to carry back on Dragon Quest and here we are in the ep we was bringing up
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
ermergerd!
She was in the public stands watching it, Derpy defies reasoning.
oh my gosh
RD's such a fangirl
OHMIGOSH
I love it
:D
Fangirl adorableness
noooooo

Fangirl Rainbow Dash
05,15twilight_sprinkle would you rather live as a starving artist/writer, struggling to get by month to month?
:D
Love her
rainbow didn't bow...
critickitten : I hope your relationships never dissapoint you. This may be hard to do
not biased at all by the way
Technically Rairty made that competiion much better.
Rainbow Dash acts like a Brony who runs into Lauren or Tara on the street
ommigosh
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
derpy
Me when I saw tara strong
OHMIGOSH
Lyra enjoyed the show.
Falling to your death is a real climax
fluttercry: some would, yes.
I dare her to say something besides "OHMIGOSH"
Nothing not a damn thing
Rex_Ivan: Too late.
TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
Would have been funny if Twilight said that :P
free falling
soooo this episode....
Best wedding ever.
a Rainbow Dash episode or a Rarity episode?
flank
fluttercry i dont really care for writing, so i dont know how it is for writers or artists. but maybe i would, it depends on many things
CrimsonPhoenix will not be seen for a minimum of SIX MONTHS!!!
cause it was Rarity that learn the lesson
best wedding ever. best day ever. best pet ever
*wink*
shes gonna GET SOME!!!
Is that...two soarins?
you cant do it
Definitly a RD ep
O.O
Even Soarin defies logic.
THE END
And then they screwed, the end
IFUKNOWWHATIMEAN.jpg
nice Rarity episode 10/10
cachi01: Best____EVER!
CrimsonPhoenix that is, Sonic Rainboom won't be shown for six months minimum
see ya around everypony. bedtim for me
And then everything sexual there is not other way to interpret that
*sigh*
that was great!!!!!
(Hey a mod made that joke last time I can get away with it)
11,01Night everyone.
I liked it, but I didn't like the way Rarity was portrayed.
07,01And with that I bid you all adieu take care everypony and see you hopefuly tomorrow
Fou_Lou: dream of ponies
Critickitten : it's a fine thing to set standards, but when no one meets them, you may want to loosen them up a bit
fluttercry: if i didnt have to support anyone, then i mightve chosen to try and pursue. it really comes down to whether a person is willing to take a risk for doing what he likes
g'night Nittany_Discord
night Nittany_Discord :)
Night, Nittany_Discord

TOOOO THE MOOOOOOOONNNN
YOU'RE BANNED
05,15twilight_sprinkle the point is, if someone has no education, or chooses a field of work that isn't very stable just because he likes it, their life isn't going to be nearly as easy or comfortable
Make it okaaaaaay

THANK you everypony f0r attending the second delivery of NOSTALGIAWEEN........see you all tommorrow for the re-run and goodnight!
fluttercry: obviously, but at the same time, if they can make it, itll be a lot better than having an average life. so it really depends if you are ok with living an average life, and how willing you are to take a risk
nice
fluttercry, I have a full time job and I'm working my way on getting somewhere in acting
flutterchu: true, but that doesn't mean they'll be unhappy with their life. If going with their passion is more important to them than stability, then who are we to tell them not to go for it?
Dragonforce!

Dabi are you there?
05,15In the end though, people can do whatever they want. Even if in my opinion it's dumb, whatver makes them happy right?
twilight_sprinkle: not really, actually. It all depends on what you do with life. "Average" is what YOU make it.

twilight_sprinkle: well that's essentially any entry level job then, save for specialized fields. And generally speaking "jobs that can be done by anyone" don' require a degree to perform.
Sumica and then Future Twilight shots it with a shotgun

05,15South Park is best cartoon
http://ponybot.net/?i=5487
uhhh
WAT!?
twilight_sprinkle: actually they do. They ensure you have the skills and knowledge necessary to get a job and perform well in the field you've chosen. For instance, not just anybody knows how to make an image of a hard drive and analyze the information taken from it, thus not everyone can get a jow in computer forensics or data recovery
hahha
When does Movie Night continue? O.o
fluttercry, did you see the new one?

CriticKitten: this is what happens when West and East mix

Okay, don't ask for Ponies and you get |G3.5. Ask for PPG and you get this
buttercup is still the best
so.. they're someting between powerrangers... and digimon?
arent they suppose to be in kindergarden?
Calm down, otakon. :D
CriticKitten: yeah kinda and their powers come from that fakin balls they have on their belts. which came from outer sppace :I
Dark_Horst Dunno

CriticKitten: indeed.....
By the way, this isn't the first episode.

CANDY
Well I'm going to go kill myself now
how does that phrase go? "Oh Japan..."
bubbles... ies dead to me
Why is Mojo doing this? :D

Japan what r u doin? Japan? Japan, stahp
this is sense not making...
. . . . . . . . . . . .
Kawaii_icybeauti: agreed
i prefer The Adventures of Kim Jung Un
cachi01: japan made this?
suddenly teacher
O_O
THE FUCK
Ah this
um
huh
....
Ms. Keen?
She ded
I know I'm supposed to love and tolerate but...
well so much for that
uh nvm
This is strange. Not really terrible, but strange. :S
teacher used faint
THIS. IS. GLORIOUS.
teacher was almost cool
The creators of this show are making it REALLY hard.
Hello world
WHY IS THIS SHOW SO NOISY?
it's not very effective
otakon: cause anime
Guys...that's NOT Ms. Keen...
hey
guess the 80s mlp t shirt of the mane 6 has alot of bronies complaining at wal mart, and Ghost is laughing at us :(
otakon: japan
HADOKEN
WHAT?!
This is....I don't even know what to think about this.
RAWRity: Yes, and voiced by Tabitha no less
WAAAAAAAAAAAT!?
and then he was a UFO
of course buttercup has a giant hammer
ACTUAL BUBBLES?
WHAT
....is he shooting rice balls?
THIS PLACE SUCK

Mercury Bubbles!
I want to commit suicide...
How's life?
OMG DERPY:P
Pretty good, you?
CrimsonPhoenix: It's so cracktastic I can't decide if it's awful, amazing, or both.
This has driven away all of my hope for my life.
Someone was snorting before they made this.
Fucking Bubbles!!
wut da fuck id rather watch rainbow factory
THIS SHOW SUCKS
WAT
make sense darn you
I also hates the fact that they uses weapons...like a wand...a hammer....and a yo-yo...
Booo
RAWRity, maybe a so bad it's hilarious would fit right in
Good too
CriticKitten: this just proves the drugs in Japan are WAY stronger than what we have here.
cute bubbles > sexy bubbles
I'd rather watch the cupcakes video than this shit.
pony_9001: rainbow factory is agood fic :I
Instead of just fighting bare handed.
....seeing in that angle it might be good
This is not a good show.
dang it's like kenny...
yep :3
well at least her face is still hidden
Japan, i am dissappoint
i'd rather watch madoka, but i fucking love madoka
O.K. At least they were consistant with Ms. Bellum.
and Bellum HAS NO HIPS OR BUST!
and AT LEAST they respect the secretary character
it wouldnt be so bad if they had actaul weapons
yeah, the animation's kind of crap.
wait, he has a kid O.O
HEY
...did i just hear spikes VA?
WHAT! The Mayor has no hat? :[ BLASPHEMY
its just the show but in anime cant you appriciate it for that
WHERE IS MS. BELLUM'S BOUTIFUL BUST AND HIPS?!?
00,100_o that looked wrong
Hey, remember those characters in Bleach who wield a giant bat and do nothing in every episode? Oh, right, of course you don't BECAUSE THEY'RE FUCKING STUPID. So let's make a show focused entirely around three girls like that!
Well at least Miss Bellum they hid her face and tried to make the Mayor sound like Tom Kenny
running out of power?..
Cypresswolf: and no pickles!
Running out of power? The fuck?
Sumica: I know right? :S
also they run out of power?
Sumica: :D
....
^^
run out of power? WHHHAAAATTT!
They have a power source?!
Dark_Horst, most likely not
They can run out power? -_-
That sounds wrong.
WHAT?!

Thought his favorite was...pickles....
FUCK DA TOWN ICE CREAM
Buy some ice cream now!
the most hated anime......ever
evil is a flavor now
I do like however, that the assistant does not have her face revealed
....evil flavor.
The flavor of evil?
The creators of this show should not breath anymore, they are a waste of oxygen.
mojo jojojo... what the hell was he called?
This is wrong
I... this is horrible
Oh god, that is the worst plot
Just Mojo Jojo.
ROBOT JOJO
This is wrong and twisted and bad
oh yeah BTW THE BAD GUY IN THIS IS A FUCKING BLACK SMOKE
Still better than newborn cuties...
No Tara, but we have Tabitha, Cathy, and Nicole instead
Dear god, is this still going?
biggest ripoff ever
Still a better love story than Twilight.
Dammit PPG! You had ONE JOB!
Mojo Jojo got a robot... :|
Kawaii_icybeauti: Agreed. :D
Mr. Yo

MOJO'S BLASTING OFF AGAIN!!!
flutterchu: this isnt the pilot
Wait, NOW they're able to win against him? :D

my asset is going to bed. I might stop by after my football game. I'll see yall tomorrow.

AJIsAwesome: they had sugar, which was nice

Princess celestia?
I blame this entire show on Spike.
richfiles: WHen Gordon meets Chell.
richfiles: when gordon met chell
.....yo-yo.
There's an episode on why these black...comets...thingies affected normal townfolks into villains.
Hey who hears SPike's voice in that little proffessors voice

I remember that show
Well, that happened. :D
flutterchu: the pilot is about those balls in their seatbelts coming from outer space as meteors and they hit the 3 girls nd then they have SUPPAHPOWURZZZZ

Rosfox: I guess so. :S
