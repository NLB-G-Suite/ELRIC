Pony dances awesomely

Also has anyone played that Terminator game for the SNES?
otakon: See my previous statement
88 MPH!
SO I keep ride my motorcycle
00,02he hit 88
Out of curiosity, what's going on in the movie?
OmegaMaidtroidBrony: I played the Gameboy version
Xaiden: i think its somehwere 199x
When the bike hits 88 MPH we'll see some serious shit
You mean the Superscope game?

Yeah, kinda knew they would get advanced enough sooner or later.
Kandarihu: that was just bexause they were taking the servers off line. It wasnt a HGUE deal
0,14well, generally video links aren't allowed during streams because it comes across as kinda rude

NO PALM TREE NOT YOU!
11,01They supposedly destroyed all work of Skynet, but the producers wanted another movie.
The hell. is with these movies
dun dun dundundun
sorry about that, missed a dash xD

Xaiden Fluer
I wonder how much training/drugs arnold did before this movie, he was obviously not that ripped just before it
Xaiden: that's Fleur De Lis
Skynet apparently decided, for their stealth robots, to make them ALL LOOK LIKE THE SAME DAMN GUY.
Phase4: its better then the 3rd
Phase4: Because Money
John COnnor is adrug addict?
he needs his drugsssssssss
11,01Was in Sweet and Elite.
CriticKitten, in the second movie, it disintegrated everything caught in the arriving temporal displacement. In the first movie, it just made lots of electricity.
GRABBIN PILLS
CriticKitten: odd no?
who is the pony with the green mane dancing
00,02it may be good but still

SIXTUPLE TAP IS BEST TAP!
Eulshy: bc they do not care.
So this robot is supposed to be an advanced robot designed for COVERT OPS to fool humans into thinking it's normal...
So after Comic Con, the Derpy toy should be be at the Hasbro Shop
not _again_.
Eulshy: they could not care less.
Eulshy: They will affect the future so she has to kill them
Yeah, it's doing a bang up job with the whole covert thing

CriticKitten: yep
GarettBrony: the deleted one
Ahnold!
ARNIE IT'S ME JOHN
I'll get the Ice Beam.
thought this one was a T-X
Eulshy: basically think T-1000 over a T-800 chassis
Why is the new model using a metal skeleton when the last model's all-liquid-metal structure is CLEARLY superior?
Happy reunion time!!!
no
Tassadork: that is T-X
or seduced me?
NO.
11,01Chatzilla's /ban does IP, then nick if the IP isn't there.

Marx: nope. seems to be a mix between a normal metal skeletton and a t-1000
no
Here we go agian
Fank celestia he dun die
Why this scene is so funny?
CriticKitten: because it can make weapons bc of it's endoskeleton, best of both worlds.
NAOW
they should SPAM termiantors to the past tio zerg rush John
like that
oh gof
.....oh.
ouchie
ohcrap
that pulse shot
Okay, that seems legit.
ouch
Hooray for physics
we should watch back to the future some time

THAT is why it's not just a T-1000

why did they keep reprogramming inferior terminatiors to protect the ones who needed to live?
awsome

If her arm could do that, getting a hand job from her would be wonderous

Maybe they can't hack the better Terminators.
Xaiden lolwut
And no one notices this girl?
Seriously?

Kandarihu: T-X was new, only one made
i think i've seen this effect in Fast and the Furious

Ahhhh shit the Lady Bitch found her
lol
DAMN YOU VERIZON!
LOL brick cell phone
Nokia
....
Uh.
okay HOW did she do that?
Wat.
I mean, taking out a T-800's main CPU and modifying it makes sense. The T-1000 is one distributed computer. If the T-X is one of a kind and on Skynet's side, it's kind of out of reach.

Okay, I said before that the Terminator from the Second movie was cheap, but dat car shit is just plain unfair
Kandarihu: eeyup, the official comics had a "test" for the T-X where it fought a T-1000 to the death
DON"T FORGET SEXYNESS

THIS ROBOT IS SO STEALTHY
Of couse she hits gas canisters

00,10CriticKitten you think it gives a shit about stealth?
what of the odds of the explosion truck being their?
11,01Cars can't be controlled be machines.
11,01So, yeah.
ponibas I dont think i'm willing to suspend my disbelief anylonger
break EVERYTHING
This is a sneaking mission
11,01Even the way this lady did it.
I've done more damage in GTA IV in like 5 minutes, this is notin
11,01She'd have to build a way to steer the cars.
Sumica: It kind of should, since that's its primary function. The robots were designed to look human to blend in with them, remember? >_>
what movie is this
T3
tigher1001: Terminator 3
Nittany_Discord: modern vehilces have aCPU
Dat hook slap
Sumica: Otherwise they could just cover a TANK in human skin and send that back.
this city made of cardboard and explodium
00,10primay mission is to kill him I think that over rides blend in with target in sight
Well, it's doing a great job of blending in, isn't it? >_>
11,01But not automated steering.
ohh in that case ima leav cause i dont want spoilers
suddenly residential
Sumica, good point
CriticKitten: That is a vferyu very disturbing mental image.
CriticKitten: That would be interesting, human tank

Dat grab
Yay
11,01Sumi
Tank covered by human skin? eww
Sumica: Difference is that in T1, Arnold generally wasn't trying to make himself public. This one gives zero fucks.
00,10I think they gave up the liveing tissue bit with t2
SirGanjalf: yeah ew
He gone
donk
oof
splat
lol
Ohi
Sumica: yeah good point, HOW did the T-X and the T-1000 get through?
CriticKitten: Doesnt really matter because she can change look at will.

XD
needs more rainbow dash
okay, just how UNSTOPPABLE is a truck like that?
dance pony
operatorpony2: And yet we will still watch him
its a miracle that lady in the back is not half dead yet at the very least
i think arnold is compensating so for something
otakon: Pretty bucking unstoppable
Obsidian: he is/was atotla Dbag ofa govinator
jaguar noise
GarettBrony: he's got muscles bigger than you head, not likely
11,01I heard a jaguar.
00,10he axed her to let him drive
dance pony dance
For_Lou: All the same, this is sort of against her design protocols. :P
So have they explained why these Terminators exist? Ah heck, this is already potential for a new timeloop.

GUess she got hung up.
t2 was was better
00,10he is the "t1t S"
11,01They admitted that more parts flew from that truck than existed on the truck.
SirGanjalf: Guess 13 year old John taught Future John somethign
That cable can't POSSIBLY be that strong. ._.
t0 was best
Marx, yes
00,10the snark model
Her outit is terrible
So after breaking everything and alerting the military...

GarettBrony: he was Mr. Universe back in the day. and from exercise NOT steroids.
Alright. Time to blend in.
>grabs head forcibly to check for brain trauma
Yep!
now you feel like a douche
00,10take that as a no
otakon I know that I was just making a joke
Unable to comply with bitchy backseat drivers
405 freeway. No traffic. Hax.
So this model is designed with the exact same appearance on every single robot.
oh i get it cause he cant self terminate
GarettBrony: ah
Think about that for a second.
dat desert
hen3ry: the interent is down thats why
and she did that for 50 miles
yep, she's gonna in this whole movie.
It means the primary goal of "blend in with humans" is STUPID.
Secondary targets
The pony dances again, it is fun to watch
the ymake babies
Because they look the same damnit. ._.
11,01They located him the last two times.
Except that the model is played by a human actor who is aging.
CriticKitten: not in the future, when it was humans hiding out.
oh shit
00,10heartburn of the future
11,01This flying in the face of the last movie.
THe francise will never die
Shhh, John, stop pointing out the plothole that is this movie

JESUS, TAKE THE WHEEL

StinkomanFan: THIS

Would anyone play TF2 with me? :3
Or maybe some GMOD?
Phase4 can you replace the heavy whit a pony ?
Storm in like you own the place and demand they take you to the ponies or you'll Friendship them so hard, they won't ever look at magic the same way :[
BlazeAngel: What do you mean when it gets deserted? Everything ends at some point, and so will the site, but I don't really understand your question, when the site shuts down, it shuts down, people would still be able to join this chat room, but if it's 'deserted', there wouldn't be anyone here anyway
00,02ducky, i dont know
Phase4: you should do a reversal role with the Minigun and Heavy
00,02XD
and you shall call it Meet Sasha
i like that idea Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
^
I don't understand your question.
I mean the toy stores - of course :) (>_>)
Phase4: and replace all the ppl with guns too in the background :3
When it's deserted, it's deserted, nothing happens

Bronysith: Whoa. Mindbucked.
http://cheezburger.com/6328276224
lololololololol
you posted these yesterday
http://cheezburger.com/6328554240 the MOST IMPORTANT RULE IN ALL OF GAMING. follow this rule and you are a true gamer
00,02well
:[ Cry Some Moar!
00,02change only stuck in one scene
00,02and the camera broke in the 'who tuched my gun' but
00,02bit;
00,02i'm tired if you cant tell
Bronysith: thats my mentality with games
Phase4: i would be too
oni_link: those who disagree with that rule are false gamers and should not be playing
Amen! to that Bronysith
BlazeAngel i am ready
Phase4: id say you've earned your rest, if you desire it
ducky: I need a min.
good night Phase4
graphics are a luxury :$
DERPY!
when suddenly, derpy
Dear god
300 derpys :$
is this too many derpys
00,02i can reach this box
00,02clearly not enough derpy
Phase4: you cant break these cuffs
Phase4: NO KIDDING?! XD
my eyes are having problems with that
needs moar pinkie
Sell incomplete video games *coughFABLEcough*
Bronysith: my friends are Xbox fanboys and when they see me play TF2, they talk crap. they also ask why it doesnt regenerate. I want to slap them in the back of the head when they downtalk games based on looks and what is not in the norm. also, they talk crap when i play older games (8bit era, etc.)
lol i turned on 'this is war' song just as all the derpyus appeared
oni_link: but older games are the best ones! super mario bros is one of my fav games of all time
whoa, flight of the bumble derps
derp
XD
health regeneration? why not just ask for ammo regeneration
oni_link, my hat goes to you sir :F
I can't hold all this derpy
song: TO FIIIIIIIIGH -and then all the derpys appeared
Mother of celestia... so many derpys.
*fight
Bronysith: I know right? I just dont know why they dont get it.
Inb4 Derpy crashes stream
SO MANY DERPY :D
And thanks MadSurge. to what do i owe this pleasure?
oni_link: i used to think if it was non realistic and poor graphics. the game sucked. then i played final fantasy 7
ALL THE DERPY
oni_link: that is when my entire thing on gaming changed forever
For talking about old timey shooters where you couldn't pussy out your way by hiding
TO DEUS EX
MadSurge: to the classics! * raises glass*
00,02:<
damn dc
00,02wont let me have more than 1k ponies
00,02i
To the classics. *raises glass*
00,02i'm disapoint
00,02but they do distribute the source code
DEAR GOD... 2000 DERPIES... THAT WOULD BE EPIC
Bronysith: mmm FF7. I honestly had a revelation when I played Castlevania 3.
Do 1000 Dashes then :D
how many ponies do they let you have on screan at once
Phase4 then not over 9000 ponys
1000 sonic rainbooms
00,02oh yeah
oni_link: but ff7 had horrible graphics but great game overall
00,02i havent installed the vb component
00,02because screw vb
oni_link: btw i am playing deus ex right now. horrible graphics as well but a great game
I want to get a super computer, install desktop ponies, then keep adding more until it crashes just to see how much pony it can handle
00,02Bronysith, there are a lot of graphics mods
Cypresswolf: it still won't be enough ponies :D
00,02dx11 renderer that looks good + new models and textures should work well
:) Nope
Cypresswolf: it could probably handle about... 10 of everypony. XD
Bronysith: Yeah, I can see that but i guess it never bothered me that it didnt look so good. also I havent played Deus Ex.
00,02Cypresswolf, my pc is limited by the softwares efficency
00,02which is very poor
00,02inb4 gldesktopponies
so what now
and crash
:D
there gos the steam
and then there was NM

08,01it's season 1!
Love your music Sim!
I still rmember how I found bronystate in the first place. I was watching a Save Derpy video on youtube and I saw Bronystate chat reaction to Derpy speaking so I decided to watch it and somepony linked the pinky pie chat room to the video. The first mod I ever met was Sumica and the first stream I ever watched was him playing Mass Effect 1
you*
So I'm off guys, I'm going for a bike ride as usual. See you in a bit!

Richard Dean Anderson got really fat I heard.
STARGATE, what is stargate?
Everything but the Military!!! They do everything wrong!!!
Cover 360 degree angles!
Sumica: You've already seen the ending and everything right? you mean finish it over stream?

00,10the early eps are good dari
or heard of stargate
:I
I would like to know what kind of Material this actually is
08,01ah, season 1
08,01where all the music was actually done on real instruments
stand back i'm going to try science
08,01this is one thing i hate about the times we live in
scinece
when they had a good budget for a tv show
00,10ah a new top 10 vido
anypony here a girl? ^.^
00,10I will have to look at that later
yay i love the new EQD post
I don't know what we're watching...
I wish
Stargate SG1
Stargate?
08,01it's so much cheaper to use synth orchestras now that hardly anything, even relatively big budget series, use real orchestras anymore
Oh, thanks.
08,01it's such a shame
wow, he really let himself go: http://derpy.me/9TGIQ
08,01because you lose so much
question... why is this stargate on this Planet in the Middle of Nowhere?
this is scary D:
lol
alguien que hable español?
08,01ImmaPonyLuvr: 80% of the scariness is the music, i think
00,10so much is invested in sound that peole often over look it
boom
08,01and with a synth orchestra you jsut wouldn't get that
Alchemist: Sheesh the after years werent great for him. :/
08,01which is why i realyl, really hope that if there's ever an MLP film, it'll have a real orchestra
almost sounded like the music from predator
08,01Sumica: i haven't, actually
they're actors
omg
they should put night vison gogles on the carma so we can c everything XD
i really doubt it will have one
00,10You should check them out some time
real orchestra plus MLP songs
Stargåte
00,10it's amazing how much sound work they put in the show
08,01Sundaysmile: next semester, i'm going to see if i can call in a favour with an orchestra i'm involved with and have them play somethign pony
@Sumica yeh its so awesome! but nothing can beat the muisc in mlp
so Dark
Set up a recording session for that one
08,01i will
00,10I was talking about the music in Mlp ImmaPonyLuvr

@Dark_Horst Yeah I know it's Italian, but the way it's done is in this Anime-like style. Not real a fan of it
this is great
especially when it's WAY TOO LONG

minecraft!
Terraria
Watch out for the Reapers!
you should play dwarf fortress...it's like sims, but every few days some clay golem or dragon or whatnot attacks your sim house...and you can weaponize everything ^^
That sounds like fun
derpy_pony: awesome XD
dem Reapers
ohai ME
the only drawback is that the gui is...rudimentary at best
i tried dwarf fortress. they're not big on beginner's help
lol
nope
also, i couldn find a texture pack i liked
but there are youtube tutorials now
I prefer pure ascii
Ugh whats wrong with his face!?

hey Bronysith how have you been
Wrek: OS?
But Wrek, it's time for Summer Sale!

Portal 2 is 75% off, Heroes 6 is 50% off, Total War Shogun 2 is 75% off, and Terraria's 75% off. For those curious about today's Steam deals.
Sumica: i know

Wrek: You put Wrekky on Sleep?

Chrysalis: nah
how many pages of that book has twilight read?

Sumica Thats one of the reasons I stopped playing TF2. Hackers. Fucking hate hackers.
∞ starsong
starsong: You'd think she'd be done by now
Ikr.
its not hacking >.>
:S
and shes a freeking fast reader
no surprise there
starsong its the book from the neverending story
Wrek: a bit onesided dontcha thinking?
but i mean like 1 second for 2 pages xD
pyro panned
She doesn't read the pages, she stares them down till they give her the information
00,10dat hard push
11,01Wish the soldier class didn't seem so weak in TF2.
ND|Nap: it aint
00,10lol weak?
Beggars Bazooka made Soldier more powerful than ever
Bugger. I was going to play some MicroVolts while TF2 was downloading. But remembered MV is online ~_~ I be idiot.
11,01Except when you have the ray gun.
00,10I think it was felt they were a bit op for as many changes as they had on solder gear
soldiers with blackbox are still OP
doesn't the soilder havethe
00,10bison dont set on fire any more for example
11,01Shizuka got Hard Reset I see.
i miss Equalizer
doesn't the soilder have the most new equipment in updates though ND|Nap

At least I can say I've got writing skills? :\
Anyway, I got Star Fox 64 3D just now.
Meanwhile, I almost never have the stream on
Rain: Exactly the problem.
13http://fav.me/d55r5cd
Because of HIM, my summer is RUINED. We had a good thing going and he RUINED it
Liokin you still get jarate'd even if you don't play soy :p
MadCanary: no, you need to borrow Saxy's BUSTAH WOLF for this punch.
/me 13gives MadCanary some cider und a warm blanket
Wrek: song name??
/me cries
I require people to tell me what is on, because I cant have the stream on all the time, else my netbook starts to slow down
/me hugs MadCanary
13shh shh rest now canary~
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I know :<
/me gives MadCanary a tight hug and doesnt let go
Rain...if i remeber i'll tell you
Rain: Noted for future referance.

Inb4 we both forget Shamroc.
/me cuddles MadCanary
Meanwhile: you know we will
ND|Nap you are seeing maids in your sleep ?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT you sound supprised
11,01No maids.
It wont help. It wont bring him back to me.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: They could probaby just like splash some water on me or throw a clump of dirt to reveal me. But no. go for the jarate :<
Chrysalis oh god i can transmit sound on internet chat ? i'm going to be rich ...
Chrysalis :p
/me dusts ND|Nap
11,01*Achoo*
Liokin better shoot you and let the blood do the rest
This guy needs to give me lessons...
11,01What's Wrek drawing?
MadCanary, if he treated you like that, he doesnt DESERVE you.
A pony probably.
ND|Nap unknown atm
MadCanary needs more hugs
/me hugs MadCanary
/me 11,01hugs MadCanary
He treated me like an angel.
But then camp started.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: :<
So how long have you all been here?
/me hugs MadCanary
He didnt cheat.
He's very trustworthy. Always kept his word, never bullshitted.
Pudge: I think since sometime in 2011 i don't remember i became alot more active later past 2011
Litwick....somthing is telling me you arnt really helping..
i've been here for a few months Pudge
Hello, everypony
i'm back
hello Dark92Enigma
MadCanary: How long have you to been related? Also, how long have you known him before?
Oh because you all seem to know each other :S
LoGaN: I'll get online now and accept
To be frank Shamroc not a lot can help that scenario.
i missed last night's movies...........
hey Dark92Enigma how have you been
pudge were all friends here
MadCanary: Sorry, I meant together, not related... :$
because i had SERIOUS TESTS FOR TODAY
Pudge: Obviously you get to know people when you have been around enough
Well...I met him last summer in camp near early August.
did they go well Dark92Enigma
We spoke a lot, got to know each other, and then we got together in April.
MadCanary: Okay,
Yeah I guess:)
alexxm yes they did..........did they show NC after the movies?
Meanwhile: yeah i guess...i just think that brining up memorys...well just seems a little.....well yeah.....
LoGaN: Look at my gamer pic
oh man
it's slendermare me thinks
alexxm The top 11 F*** YEAH Movie themes
i don't know Dark92Enigma i was only here for the back to future movie
Shamroc: It's called the try-hard dilema. The harder you try to help the worse you make it.
huh, this songs making me sleepy
alexxm which was awesome, i can tell because i've seen it several times
calling it now, he's drawing... a pony
:p
Meanwhile..thats why i woulndt try and make it better...just attempt to make it not get worse
Shamroc: Ikr
MadCanary: When you were talking with him between August and April, was it face to face, on a chatroom, video chat, or anything else
also...song choice...not the best right now..
The training instructor in SF64 3D has one heck of a deep voice.
alexxm do you want to know what's the top F*** yeah movie theme song, or you want me to give you the link?
ohh Fuuuu.... http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/118421-BioWare-Making-Free-to-Play-Ultima-RPG
More chatroom than face to face. But then face to face incresased
Dark92Enigma i saw the video but just not on here
lol
MadCanary: Hmmm... Only thing I can think of right now is that he just wasn't willing to commit to a relationship,
alexxm you did?? Let's say the top 1 F*** YEAH theme in 3-------2-------1---
So it'll be f2p but p2w
back to the future
BACK TO THE FUTURE!
...Thats what he said Xaiden.
</3
bioware making it hopes go up..... remember EA owns ultima... hopes crash and burn
/me Pokes Dark92Enigma
it'll be nothing special
MadCanary: My bad, I joined after you said that I guess, I only logged on a minute or so ago
alexxm and i've noticed a little NC fuck-up
hugs Ponies47
MadCanary: well thats us men for ya...we scare easily..
/me hugs Ponies47*
what was it Dark92Enigma
No no Xaiden. You hit the nail on the head.
/me Hugs Dark92Enigma back :)
btw here's my oc if anyone is interested http://s551.photobucket.com/albums/ii469/mudde80/?action=view&current=Happy.png
Shamroc: What you mean "US" I fear no man >:3
He's terrified Shamroc. NEVER PRESSURED HIM. Never asked this fucker for a ring. Never got jealous.
Pudge: That's pretty cool looking
MadCanary: Has he any experience?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-3wp2VVhKQ
alexxm In the credits. Between the runner-ups, he tried to mention ''Also Sprach Zarathrustra'' but he said ''2001''......
zanon: please no video links during a stream
Meanwhile: He's had gfs in the past, but a while back. Its his first relationship in a while.
killerpony7733: Thanks I gave the design to my friend and he made it for me. :)
MadCanary: Any idea how those ended?
MadCanary: Age is also a factor, if you both are in your early teen years, then you'll need to be patient
Nope.
Im 19.
because I lack any sort of artistic talent :$
So is he
MadCanary: Ahhh
eep sowwie
Dark92Enigma 2001 was out before ric flair started wrestling
Pudge: He uses vectors?
/me 11,01washes MadCanary with wub.
Yup
MadCanary is older then me? o.o huh...never knew...
MadCanary: Well I wish the best of luck to you, I hope things get sorted out easily
13canary canary do not be mad, you have friends here who love you~
Thanks Xaiden.
I know I do.
alexxm EEEYUP. i don't blame him though.
But I just want my angel back.
MadCanary: Not a problem! ^^
00,10wait who made canary mad?
Sumica: guy problems
^
/me 13gives canary the biggest shizu hug ever~
Sumica: Some guy at a summer camp
Her ex.
My bf broke up with me last Tuesday, Sumii.
Hello
I havent been the happiest filly.
so who is the oldest brony here?
hey Rainbow how are you
zanon i'd say kencolt is
fine im happy you asked
00,10we must end this person
zanon: oldest is in the 40's here
Sumica: Look at you, ready to chew somones flank out -lol
Dude I need whoever's streaming to give me some art lessons, DAYUM there goodQ
Sumica: Nice thought, really. Bodily harm is obviously the answer.
Iv heard rumours he will be running workshops at BUCK
drat by 5 years im 35 here whole family are bronies
but nothing more than rumours
even my pops. i converted them all
Sumica......bit....crazy dont you think? i mean a good flank beating is good....but murder...no..noo
that sounds like amazing rumours
00,10one can end some one with out touching them
Overreaction.
zanon: you made your pops a brony?
:D
Aye and my mother.
zanon: that's quite a feat. I would never reveal my secret to anyone i know :D
irl that is
Shamroc i must disagree, to hurt someone as awesome as Canary
a swift end is a fitting punishment
I'm inclined to point out that you're blowing hot air Chrysalis.
Im kind of glad im the only one in my family thats a brony... it makes it "my" thing, lol
Chrysalis: swift end?
Chrysalis: I swear I have see nyou before...
Meanwhile, of course
Rave|Laptop: That's how I feel too
Liokin: Oh how's your drawing going?, Saw your derpy drawing when i woke up today :P
heh i have no shame of what i like heck even my brother and his kids, slowly converted em all. showing them the music, the show n art and at the same time showing them the meaning. ^.^
Unless you actually intend to go out there and deck the dude in the face, please focus on more realistic ways to be useful.
|Discord| well i have been on pretty much every day for the last 6 months
Uhh really quick RD question, what was the name of the flying school Rainbow Dash went to?
youv proabbly seen me before :P
Meanwhile: Lol :D
Chrysalis: No I mean...what ever
zanon: if my friends found out I probably wouldnt have friends anymore :'(
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5548/
but then nothing beats sitting down with your children and watch a show you all like
killerpony7733: -lol same as always.
Pudge: Then they are not your friends, real friends like you for who you are
Pudge: True friends wounld not judge on what you like
would*
idk maybe i'm just paranoid
Pudge: I know that feel bro.
well maybe my age. right now im in a phase where all that matters is what my wife thinks of me.
Is Wrek still at it?
ECP48: Eeeyup
Pudge i told my best friend about the whole brony and he's a brony now
Liokin: Hah. So i suppose you got alot around to finish and what not? :)

00,10now that i look at stream I see wrek has a new style
killerpony7733: more or less.
nice il bbl
Sumica: Yeah :o
Pudge: Wait and see till wrek gets further into finishing it
Pudge: My family and friends were surpised when I told them, but now they don't care
and alexxm: that's cool. having a irl brony friend is pretty cool
Uhh really quick RD question, what was the name of the flying school Rainbow Dash went to?

Liokin: Still stuck at beginning to draw my OC?, :D

11,01Xaiden: I think Junior Speedsters Flight Camp.

Four bucks. That's a deal and a half.

Lies
Ello

05em pings
Minecraft and Terraria are different experiences.
Wrek
Terraria is $2.49
Yes!
Rarity or Twilight
I have Minecraft AND Terraria.
Oh! that reminds me!
I could get a new server up for Terraria potentially.
Wrek: i forgot what ponies you chose :I
Will there be a movie on Stream somtime tonight?
again
no minecraft can be downloded at minecraft.net
05read the hostory on skype
It could be the bronystate terraria server, if you think you guys would want it.
okay~
05it has a function for that
Fou_Lou: Shizuka said she MIGHT stream salvation
Minecraft is about creepers being an ass while you try to shelter from everything. Terraria is a bit bigger on exploration than building.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5381/
Pudge: anything on when?
no
11,01Barbetos: Cool.
well you expolre mines.. and land and sea
So who is Wrek drawing now?

Pudge: Thanks.
ND|Nap you play Terraria?
Ill be back quickly I must help wife or she will smite me
Kandarihu: If it's Terraria, then no.
11,01No, but we could do Bronystate servers.

tehepicbrony, Which one?
Night Chrysalis
ITS BAMBI AFTER A HUNTER SAWED OFF ONE OF HIS HORNS.
Oh no! They're making an offshoot with the exact name that I was going to give to my meta-scifi epic that I was developing for a while. I guess I'm going to have to find another name for it.
Fou_Lou: Pony Fantasy 6. Is this for real? Because I might just explode.
portal 2
lovely
steam is freezing :(
Thats a badass OC. Whose is it?
but yeah portal 2 fgor 5 bucks
for*
It's not like I was calling it Starbound from the beginning, though
STEAL
too bad my computer cant run it
that's a steal, but I already have it ^
HEY
Wombo combo!
that ain't falco
hey what gives
CALLING IT its either Colgate or Lyra
i love skyrim but im waiting till dawngurd comes out for pc
Reikim: Sure. Phoe from EQD is doing a lets play on her youtube. And waching someone play grows a desire to play it for myself
i just got kicked for no reason :'(
me to tehepicbrony
you sendt more than 6 messages in less than 10 seconds
that was an accident
It's an automated response.
Man, I'm digging this music from Wrek, but Terraria awaits. Sorry
Fou_Lou: Does it do anything new, or is it just a surface hack?
hry
wait might be Shizuka
00,10da hell
00,10wrek are you still on 5 in 10?
i just got 60 PS2 GAMES FREE
tehepicbrony: How
Running first launch
mai friends ps2 dosent work so he hooked me up
Reikim: Im not that into FF6 since i only plaed it as kid on my psx with limied english knowledge. But every character is a pony and the Story is ponified too. and theere seem some game mechanic changes
05...no
tehepicbrony: did you get FFX?
Reikim: Stronger magic and not all characters are able to learn magic anymore. for example
00,10odd, wonder why I kicked em right after you did.
Sumica: didn't let the timer reset?
Sumica: I'm sorry dont kick me again :'(
Fou_Lou: With or without espers? On that note, how does the esper mechanic work?
05mfw Pudge didnt realize its automated
Sumica: I mean, it's been happening to otakon for months.
00,10it's a bot Pudge
G'night everypony! :)
gnight
Drawing Shizuka, Wrek?
Night GilDash.
Night GilDash
lol I know I didnt know that til now :D
i havet gone thorgh um so what does FFX stand for?
Random question. How good a game is Terraria? O.o
final fantasy 10
Wrek: are you drawing the ten ponies for the project?
00,10otakon also has crap slow internet.
Very true.
05Derpy_Hooves: call it practicing
oh cool
00,10half the time he spams cause he lags out
Reikim: i have no real idea about that. Espers can only be equipped by unicorn because they can only use magic
one sec...
Fou_Lou: Makes sense enough. The downlaod button on the website won't work for me.
Wrek: ok good, i was about to say, the artist cant start til the background is done
Sumica: then rages and ends up spamming some more :D
00,10yeah
oh FFX i already has it
Wrek: as well as the list :3
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CMowCAtVkvk/T_5PXNHaB5I/AAAAAAAAEkE/ovcr16itUQA/s1600/w3YT9.gif <-- I can't stop watching this
Reikim: read. you have to klick two links on the left bar. Just the artists and other staff member credits
00,10it's a good thing we dont use the auto ban part of that script any more
Silly Filly otakon
tehepicbrony: FFX is the best game on the PS2
Sumica: You'd have to unban otakon ten times a night.
13who ist the pony on stream
Luna danced crazy!
Sumica: Yeah I woulda been banned on accident
d'aaw so cute
00,10kinda looks like a shizu pony to me
00,10nah Pudge it was like 3 kicks in 10 min got a ban
i could try to look into it i never played it im not big on FF
Shizuka: its wrek...what would you expect?
Pudge: Silly Pudge, that's not how you spell Disgaea.
Reikim: if you download it you could read the changelog thingy there will probably be all changes be listed
It looks very much like a Shizu, except the hair is an auburn rather than nean pink.
Wrek: i still got you down for 8 ponies
you still need to pick 2 more
00,10yeah but color is easly shifted Reikim
EspyLacopa: Oh forgot of Disgaea. That's a better game. :D Okay then FFX is the best 3d final fantasy game
00,10wait, wrek is apart of that project Derpy_Hooves?
ja
he is one of the artist
00,10awsome wrek
05right 2 were already picked becasue the lsit wasnt updated properly

11,02Anypony know if the Radeon 7850 is good for gaming?
dat baccon mane
00,10nah it's just for word processing

You'll be eaten alive.

Fool. How else will he learn?
I'm on a laptop cuz my stupid computer won't boot up
11,02But...I need a good gaming card to run Chess Titans...
ha ha
Hehehe. Just changed the track on Mechbeth.
I need a new computer
I like Chess Titans.
11,02I liek Meanwhile :3c
Wait, someone mention Terraria? That game's quite a lot of fun, totally worth the deal price atm.
00,10screw that, real men play extream paint brawl
Aww, I like you too SuperBrony64.
/me hugs Meanwhile
/me hugs SuperBrony64 back.
Honestly it's worth full price even, so the deal price is REALLY good. >_>
from SuperBrony64 's guess the game ost earlier i dont think hes acasual Meanwhile
00,10I have Terraria, SuperBrony64 gifted it to me then never played with me >_<
I like Combat Arms *braces himself*
Speaking of Brawl, I finally got my hands on a new copy. WHOOOOO
Sumica: You can play with others on that game? O.o
Daw! I would play with you Sumi, but I'd need to make a new dude. My existing dude has too much phat loot.
Reikim: yeah work it!
Rave|Laptop: Yep!
00,10wait is baconmane still an Alicorn?
i'll play terraria with ya sumi
:O
Area 6. Now it gets serious.
11,02I secretly wub Sumica but I could never gain the courage to play games with him...he's too good for me...
wth is he saying?
/me hugs SuperBrony64
Meh, $2.50... cant go wrong with that, i guess ill buy it :P
is steam summer sale on yet?
But SuperBrony64, don't you see....that isn't the way to deal with fears at alllllll?
Marx my favourite level in Starfox 64
/me hugs Sumica back O////O
thinking about playing Cry of Fear...
11,02I don't think laughing at Sumica will help me...
00,10nah actaly I forgot I had that game, shortly after SB gave it to me one of our cool viewers here gave me Win 7 and I never got around to installing it again.
SuperBrony64 don't laugh AT Sumica, laugh WITH Sumica
SuperBrony64: The trick is finding the right game. You've got to find a game that Sumi can't play.
see what I did thar?
:D
The song sounds like dragon force
00,10I am not lauging at you, I am laughing near you.
11,02SEE. It's always about the size of gifts and the amount of money ;A;
00,10nah super win 7 was just so i could stream better.
Lunar_Brony: no :'(
SuperBrony64: The trick is to laugh WITH your friends, silly filly. Games are instantly made more fun when played with friends. Two Best Friends, anyone? :3
CriticKitten YEAH
CriticKitten: /)

TheHoodyNinja I didn't mean to send that. I reached for the backspace, but this stupid laptop keyboard is stupid and I hit enter

SuperBrony64 U mad bro?
Dat SuperBrony64 red text.
00,10I was starting to think pony eps was gonna give me ulcers
/me 11,01dusts SuperBrony64
O_O
Rave|Laptop: Yeah, honestly it's even worth it at full price. For two and a half bucks it's a steal.
SuperBrony64: Untrue, actually. "Value" is an arbitrary measurement. Good hard work can contribute to the value of a piece. I get away with gifting my friends pictures that I spend maybe a couple hours drawing and never inking.
O_O

Meanwhile: http://derpy.me/B8Bhb This is the one by the Brazilian. I've taken a shot at the first and second chapters, and then there's a run of chapters I can't be bothered to get around to dealing with before I pick up again. And even when I do edits, sometimes the author goes right back in and undoes them, so I'm not entirely sure why I even bother.
Bronysith i could get rid of my xbox games and use them for steam ...

Rampant character derailment and OC Sue-ness abound, enough that I've actually convinced the author to let me go back and retcon sizable portions. I'm still in the middle of it, so after about chapter 8 the badness really kicks in, including an incest rape scene that makes me cringe every time I think of it.
wow bronysith just wow
Nittany_Discord :( may i talk to you for a second?
Bronysith: Xbox is good too
Sumica: If I stopped correcting people because they didn't care I'd never correct anyone.
/me kicks a wall
Alright. I think Star Fox 64 3D is pretty good. It may not be exactly like the original, but it is a good remake.
Dammit why'd I sign up for this.
Reikim: Good grief what exactly /did/ you sign up for?
Meanwhile: Betareading. It's complicated.
Reikim: Sounds like a headache.
Yesss this is awesome song the doom songs
hwagh! just finished conducting SIM surgery...
Meanwhile: The second one gave me control over one of his other stories because his cowriter dropped off the face of the planet. It's the only reason I'm still around.
http://www.solutios.com/simcutting/
Meanwhile: I still have to argue with him so the OC antagonist doesn't become a Gary Sue.
11,01panda: 'sup?
BUCKING COMPUTER! :[
11,01She should have RARITY!
Reikim: Why don't you push a boulder up a mountain, it'll be easier.
I'll brb in a couple of hours.
Ok then Zap......:(
Meanwhile: I think I might have a masochistic streak.
LEft so wuickly D:
*quickly
Lady in Blue?
wut! my internet now actually allow me to have the stream adn download to a decent speed.
and*
Meanwhile: Example: "We'll have the antagonist (who is, by the way, extremely powerful) massacre thousands! And then he'll kidnap the hottest, most powerful girl on the cast! And then she'll fall in love with him! And then he'll turn good (no word on how)! And then he'll live to have many babbies!
/me headdesks, hard
/me bangs Reikim's head on the desk.
I don't know if I want to ask how you found your way into that, Reikim.
If the story did not have potential I would have quit long ago. As is, I'm planning to hijack it thoroughly.
Final Score: N64 Mode, 1367 Hits, Wingmates never downed, 19 extra Arwings, 6 medals earned, earned $87,488.
Wow really
I've gotten over 1500 in the past.
Meanwhile: He's not the one writing it, and the last guy was pretty competent as well. I'm just going to have to hijack the entire thing out from under him.
Reikim: for the best really.
Meanwhile: Considering his idea of character development had more in common with spontaneous combustion, it's the best thing that could ever happen to the story.
Reikim: 7th line first chapter 2nd story, should be marksman.
00,10oh I go to get a drink and come back to what looks like cute twi reading
awwwwwwwwwwwww she's so adorable
Geez, Wrek, how do you get so good?? :[ Not only with the pictures look, but also the speed!
Meanwhile: Bear in mind, this is one of the ones I got around to fixing. And I did it while half-asleep so as to preserve my sanity.
I spend a damn HOUR get the Outline of my pictures done! :D
*getting
I am a terrible artist :s
^
I blink and a whole new pic is on the screen, rofl
00,10RaveBrony, draw all the time is probably what he would tell you.
or read a book
RaveBrony: It's a damn old cliché, but it's the truth. Practice hard, practice often, practice until your fingers hurt.
Reikim: This is something to be done in the day, not 1AM.
practice till ya eyes bleed
...ohey Wrek is back ^_^
00,10Well I have heard people ask wrek the same question enough time I can probably answer most of them for him =p
Sumica: More than likely :\ but GOD i give up after 3 hours of getting nothing done! :D
Meanwhile: Skip ahead to Chapter 9 or maybe 10. 1am is the only time I'm able to deal with it.
I see Wrek is back! Heya
Yepyep
ahh, holey cow. got a new phone... not realizing it wanted a smaller SIM card than my old one...
Meanwhile: If I still had the original manuscripts I'd show you just how bad it was. I deleted that shit as soon as I could.
So will there be any movies or special showings later tonight?
Reikim: Some things are best left unsaid.
I once tryed to draw Pinkie Pie. I WAS AWFUL! D:
*IT
also, I feel my diabetus approaching :)
but it turns out that you can cut regular sim cards into mini sim cards. so I got scissors. ... and broke my sim card =/
Ponies47 so ?
Btw, the streamer is doing good with the drawings.
00,10smaller sim card? wth would they change simcard size
because apple decided they wanted it to be smaller, basically
aj-huh
and everyone else followed suit
Ponies47 you are still better than all the people that don't even try it
Meanwhile: Sorry, sorry, just blowing off steam...anyway, don't feel compelled to actually read it. It's just a relief to have someone who sympathizes, for once.
00,10odd
00,02FFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU (summer sale started)
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: It looked nothing like her. Her mane was just awful.
00,10oh hi Phase4

Reikim: S'all good.
Ponies47 again so ?

/me clonks TheGreatAndPowerfulT with a cinderblock.
imnobrony: Learn to troll better
imnobrony: most certainly
Ponies47: i saw a sketch on the stream, was that what we wee talking about?
Ponies47: I'm horrific at drawing
Meanwhile it hurts you more :p
Wrek: Better: have Meanwhile throwing himself in front of a steamroller to save Trixie.
Reikim: Whyyyyy.
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I

Meanwhile see some ideas are just wrong :p
*well
Meanwhile or will backfire :p
wait... Wrek was taking one request... and I was busy doing something else so I didnt get to request in time...
I used to be a brony, til i realized how annoying they are
/me wants to die now..
Pay more attention Rain!
imnobrony true you are quite annoying :p
imnobrony: You mean you who go and ruin other people fun?
imnobrony: how?
Meanwhile, I was helping a friend! D:
/me clonks Rain on the head with Meanwhile's cinderblock
I like trains
brb
always talking about their stupid derpy obsessions and how they wanna be with pinkie pie (sigh)
is this the part where we love and tollerate imnobrony?
Oh right you're not a brony but you come here? XD
Wrek was doing request? ...maybe next time then :/
Reikim: Nah check it you have to lift and drop, not swing. It's all in the heave.
So you tbe NOBRONY are not annoying as a brony?
I sense doublestandards
05there we go
imnobrony: Oh you're a brony hater? Please, tell me how superior you are.
I like traaaaaaiiiins!
Thanks Wrek.
imnobrony: hmm... that sounds like one person and youre using that one person to judge a whole group.
/me throws the cinderblock at Reikim
then why are you here response to *imnobrony*
AdamTheDuck: Actually, this is the part where we wait patiently.
Wrek you doing requests?
R u doin reqsts wrek?
Wrek still needs Meanwhile yelling Nooooo! in the side
/me takes a cinderblock to the gut
Hey Wrek, is it okay if I post a headshot of a doodle I did
05what you had in midn meanwhile?
00,02>mass effect
they need to have a gatling gun that shoots chainsaw bullets
00,02>$10
00,02D:
i think Wrek should draw meanwhile and otakon arguing about who has the better stache :3
Wrek: Now have Meanwhile heroically save her.
MORE TF2 FOR ME NOW!
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Phase4: i bought it like a week ago for 5 bucks for 1 and 2

Derpy_Hooves: Invalid, otakon is now 'stache-less
Oh, he's back....
00,02Bronysith, lolwut, why didnt i see that deal
This guy is unreasonable annoying
i hate bronies!!!
Wrek: I'll phase the corner out of my mind and yeah, perfect. ;P
i love em
Why?
imnobrony: http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/250x250/20190389.jpg
/me hugs imnobrony
imnobrony: then gtco
051 sec
they dont shut up about thir pony obsessions
Why do you hate them imnobrony ?
please someone ban the spammer
Phase4: oh. well it was a digi sale on gamestop.com
Vordox: Why would you care?
05but i wanted to toy around Rain :<
Vordox: BECAUSE THEY NEVER SHUT UP ABOUT THEIR STUPID "PONY" OBSESSIONS
00,02ah
hahaha, Wrek
ok then
imnobrony: Ponyponypony
/me licks imnobrony
imnobrony: How much ponies or bronies have we talked about since you came here?
Do so
imnobrony: That's a generalisation.
imnobrony: you are totally a brony
hmm... right. we are here talking about steam.
imnobrony: and that's all you can use to justify your hate?
didnt your mother ever tell you not to play with your food, Wrek?
imnobrony: ALL HEIL LAUREN FAUST
05imnobrony: i hate brony haters, casue they never shut up about their brony hating obsessions
Guys stop feeding the parasprite
That's nice imnobrony. You're also on a brony chatroom. Somehow there appears to be an error of judgement here. :P
imnobrony live by example and shut up :p
Bronysith: /)
Dat reversel, Wrek :P
Wrek: I aprove.
FOR The luna republic!
What's on the Summer Sale?
lets Wrek handle this
imnobrony: if you hate bronies, why are you here? or are you secretly a brony? :3
Lasharus: The troll doesn't know any better.
Bronysith: Yo, you're the reason we get a bad rep.
ALL THEY THINK OF IS PONIES!PONIES!PONIES!
imnobrony is tottaly a brony
i think of pie
i think he is a brony ^
05all they think of is to hate bronies hate bronies hate bronies
NO SHOW HAS EVER BEEN SO FREAKING POPULAR
imnobrony is tottaly a brony
Yeah this guy is not even trying, no effort, Kick him for a few hours, Wrek?
imnobrony: My mind is divided into six segments: one for each of the Mane 6. So I suppose you're right.
05only 1 show before has been so polular (trekkies)
seee totally a brony
But then, I rather suspect your entire existence is an error of judgement imnobrony. I don't go in for all that love and tolerance claptrap. I go in for treating idiots like idiots. You are an idiot, ergo, I will look down upon you. Though I'd need a microscope.
Wrek: Nah, you forgot Star Wars. :P
imnobrony: as an example, we are talking about steam sales at the moment. dont know if youve been paying attention.
imnobrony: why dont you go ahead and tell us your fav pony
05ah right
imnobrony is a brony just doesnt want to admit it :3
sounds like it
Strange place to hang out really.
Derpy_Hooves: we all go through that stage i think
Bronysith: Well,b4 i turned against it was derpy
Wrek: Before that however...No clue really about any other bigger communities.
Why would he waste his time here if he wasn't a brony?
imnobrony is a brony just doesnt want to admit it :3
imnobrony: Turned what?
oh hai Derpy_Hooves haven't see you in a while :p
imnobrony: you know who derpy is. therefore you are a brony
TURNED AGAINST THE PONY REVOLUTION!
05what i find hilarious is that he foudn this place, which is the least "PNIES IN YOUR FAIC" place of all the fan sites i know :P
hi everybody
Aww, how cute. He's using caps.
hi Lil_B!
bye im
imnobrony: CAN'T STOP THE REVOLUTION BRO. YOU CAN'T STOP PROGRESS.
Hello, my friends!
Wrek: Well that's cause we're bronies who care. :P
AttacktheAndalite: not even the royal canterlot voice
...to late
Wrek: haha so true. :D
At any rate, amusing though it is to once again note my mind's superiority to most people like this, I think I'll now proceed to bed.
G'night guys.
Dat link Sumica.
hey MahBoi777 :)
Night Lasharus.
gnight Lasharus
Sumica y u stop the fun ....

MONORAIL
aaaaaaand he gone
well that happened lawl
05another thign that dissapoints me is how Reikim reacted to that
Wrek: All right, hint taken.
Vordox I finally figured GIMP out I think... but for now I still have one question XD
hmmmm. should i be playing me2 or deus ex?
What will this become a drawing of?
Bronysith why not both ?
Bronysith: Deus ex
xaiden: its a whole bunch of comicon exclusive official derpy brushable toys
Moving on. Bronysith, play ME3, unless you've beaten it.
play deus ex
sold out in 1 hour
Have you guys watched PONIES The Anthology 2?
Reikim: i still have me2 to beat
TheShadowQuill: yes, it was hillarious
TheShadowQuill: Tried, got bored after twenty minutes.
05taking 1 more request
Wrek: Where did you learn to draw so damn well
Bronysith: Beat iiiit. And do all the Loyalty crap before the Reaper IFF.
Wrek: neat stuff
wrek: Mines?
13request to draw?
I've played a bit of ME2.. I didnt like it
11,019 PM, Wrek must start drawing Maid Cold Front. :p
Wrek: how about a gun that shoots another gun that shoots pinkie pie missiles
Wrek can you make a pony that is like me?
Wrek: the bronystate crew
Wrek: Sonic Rainboom
11,01Nah.
11,01Wrek: Nothing.
11,01Draw nothing.
Wrek: Dues Ex pony XD
Wrek: Meanwhile and a cinderblock
hmm.. sonic racing dashie
Steampunk Pinkie with her steampunk party canon?
or has that been done
Vordox are you here? I thought I have seen your name :/
probably
oni_link: dashie wins
Wrek: Draw a non-objective representation of nothing.
Wrek: Sonic Rainboom?
draw discord
according to twitter, meghan mccarthy was in a car accident today, perhaps you could draw her oc pony in a car accident
Wrek: Needs dues ex pony
Bronysith: how come?
Wrek: Plz?
oh! oh! Wrek!
DRAW DISCORD
I looked at the Steam Summer Sale today... there was no game that catched my interrest XD
Wrek: Please a Sonic Rainboom? I AM BEGGING YOU
hey Rain!
Ponies in a heavy snowstorm - There! That's perfect
oni_link: cause sonic is dead. he was replaced by his retarded cousin
sawnic
Wrek draw rule 63 Nittany_Discord :p
Bronysith: the truth hurts :(
13http://i.imgur.com/wlxME.png .-.
reikim: well it wasnt that bad...
according to herself
11,01He started on r63 me.
Wrek: Plzplzlpz?
oni_link: seriously...the new sonic WONT SHUT UP
Dat sauce.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: so what would that be him in a butlers outfit?
I'm back
Nittany_Discord really ?
Shizuka: Dayum
dat Shizuka
11,01Before vacation. He started on it.
Shizuka: Nice OC
Bronysith: i think generations was a step in the right direction though
13http://i.imgur.com/dmTJp.jpg wrek finish?
oni_link: nope
Nittany_Discord where i was when wrek was drawing that ?
oni_link: the right direction would be 2 shot gun blasts to his brains
Bronysith: yikes.
new... sonic?
It was fun for me. i liked it
Bronysith: Now that's just not nice. Besides, Sonic's cartoon incarnations have always been rather motor-mouthed.
not always
Sonic needs to jump in a vat of hydrochloric acid.
just the majority of
and now off to me2
I have a good OC, but I am too lazy to draw it.
to destroy the collectors and what not
Sonic X was... meh...
Gotta go fast.
that was the last sonic cartoon I watched
Meanwhile: and why do you feel so strongly ?
Well, not much going on now for me here or on the Stream, I think I'll leave (have to sleep anyway XD)
Ryunosuke: What about Sonic F, an abridged version?
Night, Lil_B
Ryunosuke: 4 kids...
bye everyone, see you in ~9-10 hous
Ryunosuke: I'm referring mostly to the old, old cartoons. SatAM and Adventures.
I prefer to read the Archie Sonic comics
Bye Lil_B
Bye Lil_B.
Hai Lil_B
Meanwhile: so you didnt like the Dreamcast era?
oni_link: I couldn't get a Dreamcast/
Bai, Lil_B.
SatAM wasnt ... terrible, it had flaws, but wasnt bad
Anyone up for L4D2?
My favourite Sonic game was Adventures 2. *waits*
Reikim: Okay,
erm bye
btw Vordox why didn't you answer :(
the last sonic game I seriously played. was sonic 3 & knuckles
i got back
Reikim: It was fun. I miss the Chao gardens
Huh. No flames. That's odd.
/me waits some more
Ryunosuke: so no 3d for you.
?
3d sonic....
Whose OC is this?
so who is Wrek drawing? :P
Reikim: I dont see why youd be flamed
3d sonic just .... doesnt sit well with me
Vordox OK XD, I just wanted you to know that I can work with GIMP now, but there is still one question left, but I'll ask you about that later
He's drawing Nittany_Discord me thinks
:D
I must say, Wrek, you are an amazing artist.
oni_link: 3d vs 2d Sonic is always a bit of a heated topic, especially when you get older gamers like we have around here.
Ryunosuke: but why exactly?
11,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: There (s)he is.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: ikr? hes freaking amazing
Ryunosuke: But it wasn't really BAD until Shadow the Hedgehog.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: wrong ping
TheShadowQuill: mean't that towards you :P
Reikim: Im a fan of both. grew up with a genesis and snes but honestly dont get why the hate is so strong towards 3d.
I grew up with Sonic 1-3&K +Sonic CD
11,01I'd hate to see it rushed, though.
oni_link: It's Shadow the Hedgehog, which was closely followed by Sonic 2006.
everything else just seems...
I know it is Nittany_Discord because of MAID HOUR
flavour of the year type
Reikim: those were bad. and sonic heroes imho.
following the trend of Mario 64 and Zelda: OoT
Ocarina of time is dah best Zelda game evah
Ryunosuke: Everyone tried to jump into the third dimension. It was really inevitable. Some hit a wall, other didn't.
Ryunosuke: i can understand mario but zelda is up for debate.
this you Nittany_Discord ? R63?
Reikim: I succeded
Damn it....how does he get his strokes perfect on the first try :'(
11,01It is.
(succeeded
Segueway time!
Bronies, what is your favourite Zelda game?
RaveBrony: Because he is awesome like that.
RaveBrony: Talent and exprience
soo what did shamroc miss?
Reikim: OOT
Reikim: Never played a Zelda game
AttacktheAndalite: :o
again, like Reikim said, everyone jumped on the bandwagon, some made it, like sonic and zelda, some hit a brick wall, like sonic
Reikim: Wind Waker, cause sailing.
RaveBrony: Oh and hardware
AttacktheAndalite: a bit late, but I like your drawing :D
im back
hello zanon
*Mario and zelda, not sonic and zelda
^^^ Wrek's livestreaming
MahBoi777: It's horrific <3
Personally, my favourite Zelda is Twilight Princess, though I love all the 3d Zeldas to death.
AttacktheAndalite: NO, it looks fine^^
Hai CupcakeWarrior
my favorite, is either Minish cap, or LtP
Reikim: me too. how did you feel about skyward sword?
Ryunosuke: LtP was amazing. i honestly cant sit down to play Minish cap
MahBoi777: That's the colors of my OC and that's what she looks like. So far I can only do headshots. Full body sketches end up being butchered and rage-quitted.
oni_link: I enjoyed it thoroughly. I felt it struck a nice balance between the TP and WW styles. And it also provided a definitive start point for the timeline, so I fan-gasmed hard.
AttacktheAndalite: Ah, I see lol
00,10wreks true pasion, wings and manes
ooh wrek who is dat?
Reikim: I felt it was a great start and now we have an official timeline due to it. :) the music really got to me too. the orchestrated fairy fountain made me shed manly tears
zanon: Nittany_Discord OC
ahh hehe
MahBoi777: I try and try and say "Fuck this shit" and rage to myself while looking at other artists' work and crying on the inside.
oni_link: Man, Ballad of the Goddess. Absolutely beautiful piece of music that captivates the feel of the entire game.
AttacktheAndalite: This is good. Builds CHARACTER.
/me hugs Reikim
so true.
/me hugs oni_link back
Reikim: Nah, that's not even my best. I haven't gotten there yet.
hey everypony
yay :) brb, gonna raid my fridge
i raided the fridge already
I like this song.
oni_link: I emptied your fridge!
Hey everypony I'm back, Wrek still drawing?
yep
AttacktheAndalite: don't do that, your drawings are very good!
it looks a little dodgey
MahBoi777: What little drawings I have on there. I can't wait till I'm able to afford a tablet. Make it easier because right now I'm using a mouse from a desktop and a mouse on a laptop.
so i just got terraria and cave story on steam for cheap
damn you steam and your awesome deals
Nice
Hi everyone im back

Muffin0 EA isd THE worst
SparklyWaffles, MahBoi777: Especially today
Reikim: Jenka's nightmare?
SparklyWaffles: Remember when everyone tried to eat you?
What is Wrek drawing now?
Pudge: Unofficial sequel. Even harder than Hell.
Muffin0: because corporate greed ruins many good companies
Pudge : like four hours but im cool i got cafeine
TheShadowQuill: Yes... :(
no im curious please tell me
Pudge: Unrelated: Running Hell is the best stage music of all time ever.
TheHoodyNinja: likewise :P
If nopony has guessed it yet its nittany discord wrek is drawing -lol
I'll tell you why EA sucks donkey balls
SparklyWaffles: Dark days... there was a war, I am still traumatized...
Ultima 9: that is all
ooooooh~ NCIS is on!
Ryunosuke: Does anyone really need to be told why EA sucks nowadays?
TheShadowQuill: :c
what war
their was a war
Mufdfin0 they buy out great developers and give them tight deadlines and force them to make terribly overhyped games
Who is Wrek drawing?
psychobitch psychiatrist
...WHO WANT'S BACON!?
BRONY_4_LIFE: Huge brawl, everypony for themselves
/me throws bacon at everyone
no wonder there was nothing there!! * looks at zannon and TheShadowQuill*

I was there for the U9, UO2, UWO:O fiascos
BACON
Reikim: Oh you mean it's a seperate game? is it on steam too?
11,01Muffin0: Find a Youtube video called EA in a Nutshell. It's a bit hyperbolic but accurate.
it ... was bad
/me catches some bacon
WOO, BACON PARTY

Hey RAWRity, you heard of this band called The View?
RAWRity! What's up?
Not this one~
*noms some timbits*

hi ScootaChicken
SparklyWaffles: well... Ive seen worse :D youll definitely live. just apply some more bandaging and if needed a tourniquet above each major wound.
Do not question the motives of my waifu
Canadian_Brony: -_(\
gah that must have been a pain to pose all dem angles LadyCanary
No time for pants, there's evil afoot!
hi ScootaChicken and LadyCanary
Meanwhile: EVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIL!!!!!!
oni_link: Thank you, Doctor!! :D
Meanwhile: Then put on shoes!
RAWRity: They're pretty good, they're fairly good Scottish pop punk.
No not pinkamena diane pie
Meanwhile: Ha! nice.
Quite similar to the Buzzcocks
No time for shoes either!
Their new album is great.
SparklyWaffles: My pleasure :P
LadyCanary: oooooh. that most certainly helps XD
Meanwhile: Feet arent evil!
Meanwhile: Underwear?
Time for underwear. If only to not put you to shame.
Pants are for lesser superheroes...or just super heroes in general. For whatever reason (see: fanservice) most super heroines get sent into battle wearing glorified lingerie
TheShadowQuill: Thats if he remembered :D
oni_link: LOL
Meanwhile: She has time for make up :/
RAWRity Pants are for squares!
RAWRity: The boobage effect.
OH MAN
holy shit is this supposed to be spawn?

it's murderous pinkie :(

Canadian_Brony: Sponges are for bobs

damnit i had my someone died shirt ready
zanon: Were they sparkly?
hi Xaiden
Hi
^^
all the badass
WHOA
oh hello Xaiden
but serioiusly, even when super heroines get somewhat modest costumes, they STILL find ways to objectify them see: Power Girl's boob window
welll whats wrong with waffles covered with glitter?
just had the best chocolate cupcake and I dont even know what brand it was :(
what's he doing now?
I bought edible glitter and poured it on waffles. I live to my name every morning, now!
oni_link: First world problems
TheShadowQuill: xD
TheShadowQuill: bahahahahaha
SparklyWaffles: That's commitment
oni_link hope it wasn't made by . . . *gulp* HER
Canadian_Brony: Does "HER" have a name?
ScootaChicken: you ever listened to a band called Accelerators
Canadian_Brony: Who is *gulp* HER?
SparklyWaffles: they have edible glitter?
sweet Sweedish house mafia
SHIT!
SparklyWaffles: Pinkimenia Pie i think
SparklyWaffles: Does she look like a bitch?
Canadian_Brony: oh goodnes... me too. O.o the taste and texture was beyond normal
Xaiden: Yeah! 'Course they do!
RAWRity: I'm pretty sure there was at least one boob-less superheroine. Give me a second to try and remember.
RAWRity: Yeah, they're alright.
THIS IS AMAZING
Reikim: powerpuff girls :D
TheHoodyNinja: Yes. xD
Wrek, what will you name it?
Reikim: doesn't even have to be boobs. A lot of 'em also get gratuitous ass shots.
Hey why are you looking at 6 year old's tits
SparklyWaffles TheHoodyNinja you know what? I'm going to stop talking it because the story's concept alone scares the sh*t outta me
Canadian_Brony: WAT. I'M CONFUSE.
so edible glitter, how is it?
I can't tell which Pinkie is more creepy, Cupcakes Pinkie Pie, or this one <<
SparklyWaffles: I tied a shirt to my face and put my hood up on my hoody so i looked like a ninja
then went to school
Meet the Pinkie Pyro.
this pinkie looks like a biker.
RAWRity: Assless and boobless. I know there's at least one. It was in a weird short series I read once.
Xaiden as much as I care, there is no difference
Xaiden: I think this one is badass, but Cupcakes Pinke is way creepier
LAWL
Blade?
Is this supposed to look badass or is it a reference to something?
My Name is Skrillex.
The ShadowQuill its not minky its pinkamena
pinky*
TheShadowQuill and I never use ductape
wait did this guy draw that Pinkie Pie <<
no pinkamena
Silence is golden, duct tape is silver.
Lo
duct tape... i am confused
trolol
TheShadowQuill ductape is awesome, bro
oni_link look at my name
You put duct tape on someone's mouth if they won't shut up
I use electrical tape

I LIKE DUCK TAPE
mr bean likes ponies
TheShadowQuill I was being sarcastic
RAWRity: Mr. Bean
this looks so badass
hmm...
is Wrek playing SHM again?
6_9
Michael Bay directed this picture
Bluestrom_S he's drawing
very nice drawing indeed
shm is sweedidh house mafia, a music group
TheShadowQuill: fuck that Wrek did this
and yes he is
What will this be called
i want that jacket .. on me
TheShadowQuill the picture that will haunt my dreams
http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/s480x480/552402_2266748604930_867905148_n.jpg
I could pull of that jacket
RAWRity: Aha. I found it, among my Free Comic Book Day pile. However, it's not a "traditional" superheroine. It's a girl who gets contracted by an angel to kill monsters, a bit like Buffy only darker and edgier. Completely flat-chested, no ass-shots.
glad to see something new keep them coming wrek
Reikim: who published it?
RAWRity: hahahahahaha
RAWRity, out of curiosity, how come you don't like Green Day?
ScootaChicken: What.
RAWRity: Dark Horse, according to the cover.
someone doesnt like Greenday
:o
eh
TheHoodyNinja: It's understandable.
I know plenty of people who don't like them, and with good reason.
TheHoodyNinja: IDK
i dont either. not newer greenday at least
/me nods
whatever, i got by music
my*
^
I can /me all I want
I personally really like them, but I can completely understand what people have against them.
Im amurican
'MURICA
Overrated song.
It's probably the third worst song on the album : P
ScootaChicken look at my name
TheHoodyNinja: I am Earthican.
Canadian_Brony: Doesn't add to it's merit as a song/
lol
Or lack thereof.
ScootaChicken: I feel that their music, even in the early years was mediocre at best, and that as they've continued their career, they've only gotten worse and mroe phoned in, yet continue to be viewed as good representatives of punk music. I also hate how many imitators their success has led to, further diluting the punk scene with heartless, soulless acts only in it for the money.
TheHoodyNinja: I am a normal human who does normal human things.
^
TheShadowQuill But then what is considered normal if we're all different?
ScootaChicken I like the song by itself, but I find it funnier when I consider my nationality
the fact that they haven't even made a remotely "punk" album in over a decade doesn't help matters.
RAWRity: now see, i never viewed them as a punk rock band
RAWRity: That's fair enough.
Although the stuff on Kerplunk is pretty good.
therefore i never expected it from them
AdamTheDuck: I brush my normal human teeth. This is a normal game you are witnessing.
08,01# i really am so happy/ your smile fills me with glee #

08,01ehy all!
/me smiles
/me 08,01bounces around the channel
RAWRity: Unfortunately, other than that, everything else I got from Free Comic Book Day is either kids' stuff, strange stuff or, as you've noted, women with the most common superpower.
I dont like bands per se, i just like music
well that was a good nap :$
Although to be honest RAWRity, whilst I'll admit I like them a lot, I definitely wouldn't see them as an example of punk music.
if a band makes good music, i like them, but not all their songs
If someone was trying to get into punk music, I wouldn't recommend them Green Day.
Or at least, not Post Nimrod Green Day.
TheHoodyNinja same. The only exceptions would be Simple Plan, ABBA, and ELO
ScootaChicken: exactly
TheHoodyNinja: neither do i, but like a lot of stuff, the general public heard a word, applied it to something they thought it fit, and fucked it up. Like how people think MCR is emo, or that "screamo" equals anything with screaming.
RAWRity: thats not screamo?! holy crap!
whos gunna save the worlds
Canadian_Brony: Exactly.
What is screamo then?
cratorkid Canadians
Their aesthetic aside, I don't really understand why people call MCR emo.
cratorkid: ninjas
TheHoodyNinja: Rebecca Black.
is this Rarity?
SO EPIC :D
lol
CAnadians
THEY GOT THIS
I mean, if you take the time to listen to their music, it's hardly representative of the genre as a whole.
hey everypony
TheHoodyNinja: orchid, Pg. 99, Comadre, Saetia
OOOHMAYGOD!
Alright. I think I'm ready to try playing online. But I'm going to be using a hardcore character.
RAWRity: To be fair, to be even able to distinguish between anything other than "pop" takes years of experience that most listeners aren't going to get.
I mean, Teenagers is a fucking 12 bar blues rock song/
Pinkamena
nope its Apllejack :P
Pinkamena Murder Pie :S
RAWRity: Example: anything electronic these days is apparently dubstep. I had to explain to a friend the other day why he was actually listening to trance.
Reikim: or rather, it takes some actual research, rather than somebody looking up a band's genre on wikipedia.
This is Derpy
GOOD LOOKING PINKAMENA<3
Or Trixie
silly fillies, this is Braeburn, obviously.
hello :3
Nope its luna
im right your all wrong
TheShadowQuill: no, this is not my car.
So, is there a Bronystate Terraria server?
god damit pinkamena XD
Pinkamena is best poni
pinkamenax- ponyrang ep
RAWRity: Completely wrong. It is obviously Big Mac and Discord's lovechild.
Kandarihu...there is no bronystate anything currently....
your all wrong, its The Rock
Did he draw the Pinkimena?
RAWRity: Also, quick little funny I found as a result of your comments earlier regarding relative superheroine chest size: http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/newsfeed/000/213/275/they%20act%20like%20ballast.jpg?1323150693

No, this is Patrick.
oh, btw, check out Make Do and Mend's new album "Everything You Ever Loved". Had it on repeat all day.

Awsome pinkamena is awesome
