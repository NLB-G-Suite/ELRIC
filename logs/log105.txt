A little slower and more precise with the chopsticks...
I'm using just my thumb to type everything...
It works very well...

I used pins and drinking straws, Daz
One pin to keep the hair in place while curling the hair up, and another to keep it in place once curled tight.
i see. i'll try dat when i need it :P
p.s. it works i've tried it, just haven't done the rest of tail / hair.

Lemme find something

lol yeah I've seen that one
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/a0f30dfe2ec8c6ae6b8d3bc991989ada/50970%20-%20luna%20sad%20socks.png
Poor Luna, out of work since Episode 2. :(
That's mean
She's crying too ;_;
Although I just don't like her voice
i laughed i cried.. i wore socks
Well, she'll be on more in Season 2...
I hope she's actually made a permanent mane 6 character.
Well, mane 7 at that point
then everyone would be hating on the devs for fighting is magic saying that they hate luna
and fighting is magic would stop development
Eh
I dunno, I think Mane 6 works as it is, but I would like to see more of some other characters on the show.
lOl
Luna and Celestia would probably be overpowered characters anyway :p
There's hardly any point in trying to make the point for either or
Have they definitely said they won't have Luna?
i had an awesome idea for a fanfic
not that i could write it
Haven't seen that show, unfortunately.
well i think just from that people know where i'm going with my idea lol
alright then that brings me to my other idea..
but that's probably been done
lol that's pretty nice actually
Buuuut probably been done too.
an idea i had for an RPG is this
Moral of the story is that she'd be pretty average at everything she does, but not exceptionally good at anything
Hmm
To the #Bunker !
lol yah

Twilight
A random unnamed has mod
-.-
Why must synchtube torture us?!
honestly, I would just suggest having him take the extra time and set up a dedicated client
assuming it is a smartphone
if not, then jmirc would be his only option
or a mobile friendly web app I am not aware of
can you ask him?
This rediculous
lol just did
he's gta txt back
7smart patient
She Crazy.

Hi people :)
Fuu dinkypage isn't loading either
Hi person!

Kidding? No. Page loads instantly for me now.
I'm going to do that now.
Good tip RP
If you want to see the countdown again you'll have to unblock it, I guess, but countdown doesn't work ATM...
np, Reaver21 :D
as long as it is not MetroPCS, it should be able to use jMIRC
Can't connect to IRC on a rotary phone
does not matter, MetroPCS has their shit locked down tighter than a monestary full of virgins next to a nightclub
lol
lLOL
YEAH
/me rubs his head
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER BRAIN ALRIGHT
ouch
Ahhh. I see!
7for-ever!
lol :P
soooo, its a no go with him connectin on his phone?
seriously though, Metro PCS and their line of dumbphones are impossible for the average layman to work with
only if he is using MetroPCS
Reaver
I was able to get jMIRC running on a pre smartphone era blackberry
Check PMs
on the Now Netowkr with Sprint
I tried getting jMIRC to work on a friends MetroPCS dumbphone...impossible
Yeah I'm guessing this is like... the one time House is wrong.
She was as close to Pinkie Pie as you can get without being a cartoon character
7AllisZero: you want me in?
he's gto straight talk.
/me 7is a project manager
got*
is that a carrier?
If you're close to florida I'm sure they're hiring :D
network
Phones + IRC == tough to set up\
I see. OOHHH SHE JUST CALLED HER A BEYYYEEETCH
>inb4 bananas
I'm actually in Savannah Georgia, not really close, I think.
Munchausen's syndrome involves bananas?
:/ I flit between AndroIRC and Andchat. on my blackberry it was jMirc all the way, though that was less straightforward
Why would it not?
And each phone is different... especially the pre-Android generations
4Strange
Vhat is?
4I can't get the stream
refresh?
Delectable, Val.
Under FF29.
I didn't sleep.
oooooooohhhhhhhh

Decap shot me.
7the best treatment for that would be friend and magic
Dr-Luna: I think I might be having a medical emergency, too
7friendship & magic*
I have no magic...
or friends.
2"AAAAAHHHHH My knee hurts....GIVE ME THE MORPHINE!"

7that's basically all you need
7RobotPinkie: PM me please for a personal diagnosis

Fuck.

Decap, you're way too drunk to be a proper Archvillain

WE'RE GETTING UP
Eh
as in
we're in the favorites feed
2wewt!
SMMOOOOOZE
A sea of Muks
Wow
I-it's okay, f-f-friendship is magic isn't r-related to this
Yfw it is in the next season
:D
2that would be the day that I lose all hope for humanity
2and then proceed to plunge into a mentality of homicide
No, sorry
I'm just having fun.
Well
FUN ISN'T ALLOWED
RUIN? THIS WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT ON THE WORK THAT IS FIM
I...
Just gonna
Go
Over there <-
yeeeeah *follows zero*
Past Sins and Romancing Quest finished?
This must be my anniversary!
(Actually, my anniversary was Wednesday. The day I moved into the res halls)
Val: THat's a good idea regardless.
yeah otherwise we would see *shivers* Spiserses
2lol
Val
Don't you make me read some Spiderses to you Val!
I kinda like most of them
Hey does anyone know the order of the movies for next week?
Even sea ponies?
2sea ponies aren't ponies
2and they are abominations
Sea ponies are thalidomide victims, and should be pitied.
Come on Val, there must be ONE pony you hate
I see
2Nyx isn't real
2fanon does not exist
They dont have to be canon
2so is not included
Oh yah, you hate fanfics don't you?
Anyone else have a least favorite? :0
2with the fiery force of a thousand suns
2but if I had to pick one
2I hate Trixie
2mostly because everyone keeps trying to pretend she's misunderstood
2when she's just a bitch
I read that one
Luna's Excellent Adventure?
I hate Snips/Snails the most. (They count as one)
Lol
/me tries to imagine that
mfw he hates trixie
Trixie is tied for #3 pony
2I could not murder it fast enough Pinkie_pie
#3 pony?
They're bullies.
2I certainly hope they never return
2they were useful as antagonists...nothing more
2but yeah, include sea ponies :P
2in the list of not reappearing that is
You speak as if you are not scared.

Hello ponies!
yo
for some last thing I saw was the word terminated
2I feel the appropriate amount of emotions that one should express
14Hi Twilight
hiya!
I still think this one is weirder, despite knowing its origin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHZj8Xp-Ik
that one is just random...
whoops
there we go.
We streaming anything tonight?
But I am more specific!
Applebloom I guess
Fluttershy, Luna, then 3-way-tie between Rarity, twilight, and Trixie
GLASSES = WAIFU TO BE
Eeyup~
And suddenly val is a mod
That's surprising. Val is the opinion master.
Val is the mod
2and the impaler :P
>You mean implyer
2O_o
not very professional
You mean fanfic reader
I know right.
Everyone has a favorite, Y U NO HAVE FAVORITE?
2sprinkles made me pick it >.<
That monster!
Rarity is my favorite :D
/me squints
0"Oh, but I have chosen a color!"
Val, why do you have such a hard time picking favorites?
2?
2except trixie
2she can die alone
0' ^ '

0...Not a kick. Cool.
15Wait we can use grey?
Cause I'm hax
0parently not
I know this because I use teal for my text
I have a "color"
(for display, I mean. No color codes here)
14Nope, cant use grey. Its considered a color and colors are only for mods. :P
14Almost.
0It was a warning for me. :\
lol
No.
Alright
14Could just be not working atm.
11Just to see if scrpit is on
14Nope.jpg
14Lmao
0What grey?
color 15
0>Octavia's color on my bar
14Its the one a bit lighter than mine.
15I used it not five minutes ago.
0It warns
14Did it warn you for it?
14Then I guess it is picking up on it.
Octavia's is 14
0What made you think it didn't work?
14Thought you werent getting any warnings about it.
/me is making a slow me post
2so it could be screwing with my sigbht
2sight*
2very nice
14Thats cool Twilight

This makes me sad...
I..
He was talking about it the other day
XD
Pinkie_Pie is it good?
I dont know about the story
I read the author notes just now
I remember someone talking about writing it
And he said he would torture rainbow dash as well
and Fluttershy is also his favorite
/me 2hates fanfics with a burning passion
/me knows
we know val. we know
and now I'm working full time ._.
Fluttershy is certainly well-loved.
/me wishs she remembered the writer of that fanfic
Uhh.. >.<
I'm not disagreeing
Maybe not even a sad
I get misty-eyed at the least provocation.
I can't imagine how badly I'd flood the area if I trid to write one.
2lol
my only fanfic ideas are sad stories, shipping stories, and grimdark-war stories
i be a horny angry person apparently
Hi
2ohai denied

Goodnight Val.
2g'night denied_existence

2It's looking like no at the moment
"Is that even legal?" "What, lesbian Fluttershy?" "No, straight Rainbow Dash."
heh.
2Freezeframe....whut?
How are things in here?
2going good radiance, how about you?
2sorry to hear that
2fair enough :P
2don't go doing things dari wouldn't like to see in the chatlog now
2of....whatnow?
2and I shall see you tomorrow :P
yes ma'am. night
2O_o
2I'm just...I'm just going to go now
2awwww
0By Val
I only call men ma'am. don't worry
/me 2hugs mirthtinker my first hug all day!
0Hope you can read this, because I am typing as hard as I can.
... I only got to hug Luna. hrmph
2I just have to work for it ;)
2O-o
2I'm going to pretend I DIDN'T hear that, and go to sleep untainted
2farewell!
poly just... scares me
polyamory
Just with two others.
you mean, as in multiple partners?
Yes.
0It's a nice touch.
at once.
okay, was confusing it with pansexual
/me has a few poly friends
0Very cute when done right.
today is a good day for fanfics
0I was reading that, then lost it. Then Cross and Arrow came around.
Also, I ripped apart a homophobe's argument with religion
0Profit was had.
k
i dislike polyamory
just can't get into it
It's not for me, but I can see the appeal.
(And no, BDSM isn't abuse, since it's consensual)
0Polyamory? Isn't it Polygamy?
polygamy is marriage
polyamory is sex
0Oooh yeah...
0But you're still a Polygamist either way, right?
kinda like how sexual orientation is about more than just the sex.
/me 0has a head filled with fuck
0And Pedophilia's meaning has been corrupted as well
0....No
0Wut
actually, that's accurate
twas a joke. Pedo means foot
the prefix ped- means foot
or ped, as it were
0pedo-
means child and feet
0WTF
medical terminology, based in latin
Actually, you're looking for pædo
The æ (ae ligature) being dropped from English was extremely unfortunate.
it was dropped because it's hard enough to teach kids to use our already convoluted language and grammar without combining letters
0Paedophilia, for sake of argument?
0Just, right now?
0Fine, well.
0Now I forgot where I was going.
lol, another crises averted
0Amen, brudda
pretty much. I only care if cheating is involved
That's a case where one of the parties involved (the partner of the cheater) didn't consent
And yes, they are involved, even if not directly.
i personally only want one partner at a time, and i do not plan on sharing at all until we are through
0FreezeFrame is now pretty cool in my book.
http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkohdmCLjd1qfl6kxo5_500.png
0Daw
lol dat Fallweather Friends
0But still, thanks for spoiling the poly Twilight for me. I was looking forward to *squeeing* at that.
fortunately i'll forget by the time i get around to it
have you read 'Out in the Cold'?
0Yes.
0Except for the last bonus chapter
READ BONUS CHAPTER
it is hilarious, sets up all sequels, and has BEST oc in the entire fandom
ohay Polarfire
0^
for instance, 'Of Mares and Magic', I predicted the end of the story (12 chapters long) in chapter 4
anyway, I really need to sleep.
Also, I hope Merely a Mare does finish.
and the reason i predicted it, was because it was the only way the author could make it a legit story with real emotional considerations
0Author: Problem, Silvermane?
but then the epilogue...
/me 0loved the epilogue
/me 0is out
0Did you hear about Roxie?
but sleep
In the building furthest from my res hall
(Though I'm not in the furthest res hall)
0I have school too. On Wednesday.
0I AM OUT
*yawn*
wellwellwell
anyone on?
heyyyyy
Flutterhi~
FOREVERALONE.jpg
And since I'm the last girl on earth alive. . .
I shall go delve myself in Ponies
which episode
no i am the last man on earth
ohhh shit
hmm
nvm
Hmm
hello

It was great thanks.

5non-lethal to fucking blowing shit upo
5i <3 it
EXPLOSION
5RobotPinkie: aye
5heck you can even finish missions "ghosting"
5which basically is complete a mission without beeing seen by anyone, not guards, not cameras
5never triggering alarms and traps
5etc
5the difficulty is realistic
5 1 shot to the head and you die
5and it works the other way around
5sigh
>implying AI can't be clever
:P
5RobotPinkie: hard and hard, you can make it hard
Kasparov?
5which is the point of playing like that
5thats the nonolethal option
Orite
I tend to like the non-lethal option, it usually makes things harder.
5but i missjudged and he was visible by 1/10 guards
5so they all pulled out their guns
5i was up on a balcony taking them out 1 by 1
5untill 2 sneaked up on me and 3 saw me on the balcony
5so that attempt i got HS'd back
5but then i prepped with a mine in the stair
5and stood at another position

I have that bookmarked
Because its just that awesome
But then again, I bookmark everything I like
Hm
Let them hear this
Play that episode where House makes fun of his coworkers and miraculously discovers the cure
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCzXqZMbATA&feature=related
Hey man
I know, I know
I don't really know anything about TV, I haven't watched much of it for 8-9 years
Lol
XD
I wouldnt say that
Lol
can we see the latest episode of nerouticly yours?
NNNNOOOOO
XD
actually, isnt that bad
ok it got kind of worse
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69MpoVyj-b0
yeah its long, but i could of put in the one of "A Little Piece of Heaven"
Hmm, A7x, nice.
there arent that many A7x PMVs sadly
Fund it.
:P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueG7PX2PSS0
this one is pretty good too
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzoAY2FyFCA&feature=related
Lol, that was lip synced at the end.

That song plays on GTA4?
yeah, but it comes with the DLC i think
Pinkie...
the fuck is wrong with my spelling today
everything
MOARE METAL PMVS!
Yes, Fluttershy and applejack are off.
Applejack*
Yes
Thats Rarity
Lol
still impressive
I really don't see how this is good, but to each his own, I guess.
The male Dash voice needs to be about 20% cooler.
And did a decent job on it.
Dari is just jealous he wasn't given the role
You guys know that. ;P
Anyway, these are the manliest voices ever.
XD
i havent sung since i was in 5th grade
I havent sung ever, I dont want to

Note the capitalisation :P
Etc.
:P
NOWAI
Hmmm, I can agree to that...
a
and slut rarity
And it still has some pixelation on the Pinkies hair and Dashs tail
Honestly, I agree with his portrayal of dash
Dash's hide looks the most saturated
/me is back from an appointment, had beaten Metro 2033 just before leaving for it
RUN SPIKE RUN!!!!
/me has beat Metro 2033 in about 10 hours
is it worth playing?

7ohai Dari
Hai
We have, a bit of a favor to ask.
7Would you like to help us?
With?
G1 ponies?
from Catrina?
:P
Or, evil
We have "Artists" writing something
But, we have no way to make him read it.
7Would you be willing to read it while streaming?
LOL SPIKE
He'll just leave if I start reading it.
7You don't know that
Paralyzed with fear
Or some other clopfic.
You read FIS...
Lol
7Tell him it's a present for becoming a mod
I read part 1.
Never read part 2.
I dont think there is a part 2, is there?
The fic was posted as one post, but was split up within itself.
Ok, I can't watch any more of this.
7Try to keep him listening as long as possible
You lack in stamina, young dari
2on a side note
2the VA for spike sounded like Buster from Tiny Toons
NEVER GIVE UP. NEVER SURRENDER
We are also going to try to get it on EQD
Meh, I'll do it if I get something ready for him afterwards that he'll like.
Or he'll hate me.
FOOOOOOOOREEEEEEEEEVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER
2:D
Barging*
2lol hello Grandil. And yeah, it's looking like ponychan is down
7Also, Dari does one have to be an owner to give AOP?
Weird, I was just in /merch/ 10 minutes ago
I dunno, try giving someone AOP without being owner, you'll find out.
:P
down now... they need to get that sorted...
@check ponychan.net
7Can Pinkie give me owner?
Haha Ok :)
@check ponychan.net

Yeah.
:P
Oh
No, I haven't done that.
You should
lol
Y U WANT OWNER?
2he actually got her at one point
He's had her plenty of times...
You can't +q people with mode.
2and he screencapped it for all to see :P
but only in his fantasies
Also if you just give it without adding to the access list it won't be permenant.
2of course, THIS is my favorite screencap
2http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/Caramel.jpg
It'll just last till you leave.

When's the fic gunna be finished anyway?
=o
7Whenever Silvermane and Mirthtinker finish it
Is there a reason you're talking about asphyxiation? lol

Not as much as I used to, but I still do
[16:00] <ValtheJean> O_o

7Nothing honestly
I'm flattered, she's just not my spieces
7I noticed
7I can't set +F
Lol
But you can unban yourself.
And remove his owner.
As for deleting the channel, I'm not sure.
7Or delete the channel?
I have learned since last night that it is good to be paranoid
I dunno. XD
7Also, can I set the channel back to +i now?
7You banned him
really?
He just cant talk
There are no bans on this channel.
Rainbow Dash version is best version
7I see
Nothing to stop anyone from talking either.

What's this about GGgala?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSvjBcDbFHA

No pony eps outside BMN
Ok
2I never said I hated the episode
2I just hate Trixie
yeah
Trixie does suck.
errr CMC
Good.
CMC works.
We got any backup streamers?
zomg can't wait
that means you and I have to start organizing the Infrastructure, Dari
theres an infrastructure here?
pretty much like the movies when streamed by me.

http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-argument-is-invalid.jpg
we'll see
My computer could probably stream, but I dont know about my upload speed
nice
Only 0.5mbps
Pinkie_Pie http://speedtest.net
my upload is enough
Last time I checked
oh
my upload is only 1mbps
I'd totally stream S2. Only a couple of problems. My computer is terrible, I'm too lazy, I won't have the time, I can't really be bothered.... oh yeah and I don't get the hub... apart from that I'm a great candidate
and i'm in australia
Decap: do you have the Hub?
Probably?
yeah
can i get an invitation?
My upload is 0.35 mbps. lol
Can you be trusted, DecapPony?
But there's a lot going on in here, already, isn't there?
additionally, do you have a capture card? If not, are you willing to spend 15 bucks?
we want to have three S2 streamers at least
Were you in here yesterday?
we got one plus a promising candidate
capture cards are only $15?
Or no?
i dont
Does ponychan not work for anyone else?
where do you get these mythical cheap capture cards
You arent supposed to know yet Decap
Wish I were in the US, then I could stream...
fair enough
ponychan doesn't seem to be loading for me either
I don't know, no
It works on my end.
Hm
PM it to him if ou dont want me to know
We cannot allow you tell Val about anything we do in here.
By that I mean it won't work! D:<
I've witnessed first time
I dunno if you ever went to KevlarMoses's stream back in S1
splat
Stream is fine for me. Too bad I'm not watching
are you doing Caramac shipping? :P
A tyrant, if there ever was one
Close enough, but no.
2^
Far worse, actually
Poor Val.
but I taught him to use Livestream and had him get easycap
The quality was good and I watched almost-fullscreen at 1280 width-ish
Yeah stream's fine here too, today, with the exception of getting disconnected from it once
haha
oh, well is it external?
Hours of work
From several people
Including 3 fic writers
Man, I'd volunteer to stream, but with my schedule it's very unlinely.
Wow...
5 if you count their alter egos
Alrightttt
don't these fellows see their arrows and revolvers are not enough
brb
I'll be on my phone mebe
lol
it's the most affordable option
+ 1.69 for 12 ft RCA cables
Ya dun goofed
I should get easyCAP. Shame the only close online store selling it here wants 20€ lol
Give me a minute.
dari

can I ask you a favor?
Sure.
Are we watching someone playing Dragon's Lair now?

wish I had a size reference for those ponies
not because I'm scared of it
/me 7won't read it
it's more like "I don't give a fuck"
IMO
this isn't as good as the cartoon
A rollercoaster of emotions
Has anyone here read Severing?
I read all of Severing
never read reconnection though
or the Epilogue
She's a crackhead?
Did you like it?
"Reconnection" ?
I read it and reconnection
Is this canon?
Reconnection is the unofficial sequel
Rainbow Dash hurting her wings is Canon
Because cardboard and duct tape
I like duct tape, it lets me stick myself to myself while sticking myself to the wall
SONG
WUT
That's PINKIE'S SONG
NOOOOOOO
Because I feel like I'm going to die soon.
APPLEJACK NOT YOU TOO/
Pinkie's song without Pinkie, GENIUS

2lol, seeing dari's reaction was totally worth the loss of brain cells
LOL
Screw this stream. All it ever brings is rage and pain!
THEY STOLE MY SONG!
And how people over at the other IRC hated it when people bashed it
2lol wut?
I like it
It's not TERRIBLE
just bad
It's pretty darn terrible
because only kids are there
2this was definitely meant for kids
2and sure, it's abhorrent to us
2but hey, it's a decent kids show
I guess Grats are in order for Val
meant for kids. Where have I heard that before?
I agree with Val
even though he has worst color
/me 2cries
yeah
2it's not my fault!

I bet that was a hard part to learn
Lol Dr-Luna. XD

ponychan comes back up in 50 minutes
EVERYPONY HIDE
and re read the earlier ones
Ponychan seems to work fine for me, but I have never really bothered doing anything on it..
Yes, this blows...
or bloooooooooooooows if you wish
nooo dont zoom in
Is it worth doing anything on Ponychan?
Going to use ponychan's IP instead in the future...
You know, I used to like this song and associate it with happyness
but no...
7:)
Watching the muted stream does not help at all!
NOTHING
2NO
2BAD DARI
can we watch spider's web?
Keep playing thid
this
Meh, I can't stream films.
One of our mod rules.
I restreamed Spider's Web once anyway
Don't know if you were there. XD
Why would you do that? xD
I can stream anything other than pony episodes and films pretty much
Cool.
7WAT!
But it was awful...
You know it's kinda sad when these things are more show accurate then the toy lines.
Someone should sometimes stream The IT Crowd tv series, it's awesome.
7hmm
7a sec
Awesome film. XD
The biggest disappointment here is that they didn't even include best pony
Oh guys, how was the lord of the rings special?
I would not be surprised if there was some subtle reference to ponies in that show sometime in future...

The nick is registered with the network.
Not the IRC client.
(good comparison is good :P)
Yes.
Everyone is waiting someone to say/do something... I guess.
well WE WANT IT AGAIN

I wasn't there ever :(
13Daz
Anywhere on this network, the nick is registered.
13XD
13Epic chats?
I should be busy, but am kinda lazy.
This network is epic-chat.
That's why you have to do it EVERY night :P
irc.epic-chat.net
But I really wasn't there...
I was probably in denmark or something...
It would be interesting
well ponychan is back for me now
13I see
13Meteor, just for relevance
13You were in here yesterday, right?
Dari...
FYI am not getting sound from the show.
that is the creepiest archer I've ever seen
I hate you right now
13But I need to know if you were in here at any point yesterday
why would you do this?
13Because my memory is foggy with names right now
Lickety-Split is best pony
*sarcasm
@pony Worst G1 pony
6 Worst G1 pony is 7Brae8burn
lol i remember just fine:P
13Wait

13Not sure if can trust Daz
daz is my music buddy.. dunno if you can trust him though
sorry daz:P
I vote we "watch" the Dari sing-a-long

:D
dunno really.. lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1SBFXJxxGU
hmm...
13Daz, we have been working hard on something.
O_o
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I'm busy cleaning the flat.. But if there's no other requests watch that.. :p
13Nothing
13We are still waiting on Denied, Silvermare, Herospirit..
I'd request an allo allo episode, but I'm not sure everyone would like it. xD
I won't tell him, then
13You swear? Pinkie swear/
13?
13XD
It's a clip from "Bottom"
Sure
13Several hours of work
13He hates Sea ponies and trixie
13Said he "Couldnt stab a trixie sea pony fast enough"
lol
13We have two options
Can we watch this after? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvT8dMHqqVY
13Or get it posted on EQD
Ahahaha
13Or both if possible
Allo, allo
13http://images.wikia.com/mlp/images/a/a4/Caramelapple001.png
13This is our target
Good luck
13Sethisto might
Ohey
I should get something ready to make it up to Val.
13Dman?
13Were you in here yesterday?
Dman is also known as Daz
I'm just here twice
13I see
13We are already paranoid of everyone
It's to do with clients
He's a good businessman
Very :p
ahahaha
how far are you into writing this?
Yea
13Unsure
13We have 3 people working on 2 different fics
oh, just a suggestion for after this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npjOSLCR2hE
13It could very well be done today
ya
Lol
yessums?
bold?
bold
nice
hey dari
?
any progress?
Terribly sorry about that Val, it had to be done
Yeah, got everything set up, but for some reason the config refused to work for VHScrCap
hey daz.. music time?
well I would assume foreground would be the same color I've been assigned
It wouldn't set the "resize to output size" properly, even when he ticked/unticked it.
He couldn't just select a region.
Oh, thats quite alright Val
hmm
Well, I couldn't really see anything.
tell him to uncheck everything on the capture tab first
Because tiny window due to "Resize to output size" no working properly.
and then
not*
alright lol
don't use that option
seriously don't
You need it ticked.
Or you can't select the capture region.
send him the image with the VHScrCap config I have in the streaming guide
But it's not working.
...nice, i have Dari's colour schene =D
use those
well I'll help later

13What.. Do you think of him as a mod?
13As a person?
10mfw practically the same colours as dari? :P
13As a leader?...
well I can pick something else if you'd prefer
He can use colours.
But he'd have to do it manually.
2 I can use colors daz
For EVERY message.
13No
2 he's just writing me a script
13Yet.
10>no reason to my concern

13Damnit, where is Herospirit?
13I need his Olde Tongue speaking
10Shenanigans afoot? :P

13All of my most trusted advisors are either AFK or not here yet
We were talking about scripting.
13He is. He came back as soon as I kicked him
Val knows how to use colours too - he is now. >_>
10peekaboo :P

/me is still waiting for Denied_Existence and Herospirit
I think I'll suggest an episode of this everytime I come here.

Dara O'Brien's pretty good.
2 I think he's pretty entertaining
He's cool, but i HATE how he always ends a joke with 'UUUUUHHHMMMM'
But Frankie Boyle is best.
