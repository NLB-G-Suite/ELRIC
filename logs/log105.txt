Coming at you, pony!
Well TAR-NAshun
meeee!
ponies, why u no have dewey decimal system!
>Most powerful unicorn alive.
aw
clearly she's suffering from wing madness
She should have read on about the story of Icarus
Meanwhile Brain? That would be a very generous phrase, but I think of it as stale, half-aborted nerve tissue. But you know, that's just from what I can gather from my highlt advanced servers. Nothing Special. Ha. Ha. Ha.
/me glomps Crimson
IT'S IMPOSSIBRU!!!!!!!!!!!
>Isn't sure she can cast a documented spell.
[S] RARITY. RISE UP
14Inb4 epic wings

Meanwhile Pardoned........But you know what doesnt react well to neuro tissue? NeuroTOXIN.
It would seem that the tables have been turned right round baby right round like a record baby.
dork?
I dont get why they say that
Bitches you saw it! >.<
being assertive
oh FLUTTERSHY
Awwww Fluttershy
when they saw her do it when she was a kid
Cluttzershy
lol
so sute
makes no fuckin sense
wait... Rainbow Dash is a drop out?
Haha
(they're in denial. Repressed memories and all that.)
I WAS SO ASSERTIVE<3 :)
"I was so assertive!"
i find it ironic that the jocks deny the Sonic Rainboom, when two of them were practically there when it happened
I'm ok with this
shes totaly gunna be on top next time
lol best line
PC, they're dumb
she was too good for flight school
GREAT SPEECH FLUTTERSHY
Cue Rainbow Shylenol
so supportive
helpful... very helpful fluttershy
inb4 my life is RUINED!!
"silently judging you"
Fluttershy, your sincerity is not helping!
WAY TO STRIP THE CONFIDENCE FLUTTERSHY
Such a Photo Finish
Not helping fluttershy..
such motivation!
She already did it... when she was younger, weaker and less experienced. Wat?
14I love Rainbow Shylenol!
(sotha, you dont have to talk ooc, were in an open chat)
my life is ruinedddddd
*agrees*
She is almost as good at speeches as Photo Finish
Is the fucking shitstorm over?
0voice crack
Think les trees, more craters
PROBLEM RD?
thunderdash: they aren't the brightest ponies in Cloudsdale
rarrarity
you are tearing me apart!
She is starting to loose it
lol
The shitstorm over my personal opinion?
Rarity be God Tier
You suck at flying = banished
ahhaha!
No, she''ll banish you to the moooooonnnnnnnnaaaaahhhh
I'D HIT THAT
(I know Lyra. It's just a habit.)
if she didnt figure it out
GOD-LIKE!
Wings on ass
14I am RARITY! RA-RA-RA-RARITY-TY-TY-TY
you need two hooves out to do a rainboom
manly wings +1
:o
we?
(ahah)
Why so srs?
Rarity = Alicorn
the only bad thing about this episode is that it created butterfly pony figures....
CrimsonRisk; true. :P
Suddenly balloon
inb4 WAHAHAHAHA
yeah i do it sometimes too mate, a friend of mkine on skype called me out on it once
*wild balloon apears*
Banish one pony to the moon and you get scared for life
the Nimbus 2000!!!
gentlementlemen rarity was funny
IT'S TWOLIGHT SPARKLES BLOON
oh wait.
rarity's laugh is best laugh, no arguments....
Oh god not the butterfly pony figures.
MAGIC
eeenope
knowing Pinkie she could probably walk on the cloud anyways
Meanwhile okay
MAGIC
rarity's laugh scares me...
Cartwheeling Pinkie Pie is adorable.
Damn, I forgot to not cast it on Pinkie
it was easier alright
Magic! No other explanation is necessary
How does a pony cartwheel anyway?
what twisted pony actually tested to see if earth ponies can walk on clouds?
I have seen the end, and it is candy vag .jpg
WHAAHAHAA
...So we could feature the baloon, and for the storyline...
Like Pinkie
MAGIC!!! AND SCIENCE!!!
her laugh is that of a conqueror
Sage, probably trollestia
that's how a pony cartwheels
ooooo ahhhhhhh
/me thinks the walk-on-clouds spell would be a tad more widespread due to its purported utility.
WTF THIS ISNT COLUMBIA
OOOOO
8lolwut crimsonrisk
._.
AAAAAHHHHHH
AND PROBABLY THE ONLY CITY IN THE SKY...
>yfw rarity is walking on clouds
Cloudsdale so cool. Like Olympus
Doctor Whooves in the background for only a few seconds.
woh ,just noticed here wings went foldeed to not inbetween camer pans.
Sotha is correct.
Luna, wheres bon bon?
8DOSE WINGS AH GAWJISS
hothothothot
/me probably can't find the image, HB
"DAT PLOT"
Someone is going to be hit by that jackhammer
wingboners all around
Wonder where that drill landed
that jackhammer he dropped hit derpy on the head
THE JACKMAMER IMPALED GRANNY SMITH
gosmermorningdew
that's where the eyes come from
i love when they say that...because the accent is nso perfect
Where the wings protrude from aint bad either
7I have not seen her around, have you?
*born in new york*
Can pegasus and unicorns interbreed?
yay
The Jackhammer is what freed Discord for season two.
suddenly thunder
*lives in NYC*
careful.....
id say so yeah
fail...
DuckShine i like this
well, i asked because i havent seen her...
Dumb Rarity.
This afternoon this afternoon?
Hahahaha
Wow, the weather factory has a evil lightning background
DAMNIT RARITY!
thanks alot rarity
Worst. Job.
14Rarity be messing up the weather
my parents carted me off to florida...its not fair everything is so out of the way here...
maxaminus: Yes. The offspring is called a Mary Sue.
Rarity just ruined weeks of peoples lives
taste the rainbow!!!
Taste the rainbow!
TASTE THE RAINBOW!!!
owned
SPICY!
SPICY
STUPID FAT PONY
14Spicy!
PURE SKITTLEs
my personal theory (and fanfic bait I plan to write) is that a unicorn breeding with a pegasus creates a pegacorn, a weak cousin of the alicorn. They have a horn and wings, but the wings are too gimpy to fly and the horn can't perform much magic at all.
quill, the same thing happened to my best friend
yes they are
Rainbows are PEOPLE
where iis she running?)
agreed DSN
yes
If you know what I mean.
he wants manly wings +1
14Idiot patrol...
crash
Rainbow Crash..
lol rarity
XD
So meanwhile, in your inferior perspective, how are Rarity's wings?
dork
Crashie
Yeah
thats sucks bro
That will work
Do they just have a wing bo- *punched*
._.
14Hey crashie, whatre you doing down there?
Not the smarted basketball on court, is he?
poor rainbow
Beavis and Butthoof.
Hoops Intelligence: -1
they were fauning over me so why make them go away
@DSNesmith: I might be more inclined to agree with that if it didn't outrule the chance of Dinky being Derpy's daughter :P
should all the lab jackets have holes for wings?
best scene coming up
*Oh wow. Smarted.*
I see lines on the coats
doomed!
I wanna hug Dash
Use Viagra.
DSN dinky is more or less adopted
Ponies look cute in hard hats and little white shirts :D
photos...
machines power nature!
I remember seeing a Punnett Square dealie that treated Pegasus/Unicorn/Earth Pony genes as a sort of Rock Paper Scissors thing.
She's attracting both genders.
8i always want to hug dash, flutteryay
14Dang attention horses
In b4 wah ha ha
WUAHAHA
rarity gives everyone wing boners
WAHAHAHA
WHAHAHA!!

14MWAHAHAHAHAHAA
Best maniac laugh
I want to hug every single one of those ponies
WA HAHA
and then she took over equestia
also THIS THREAD IS FOR ATTENTION HORSE
Likewise, Pinkie_Pie.
Why don't the non-pegasi have holes for wings in their uniforms?
Grey Granny Smith
8dat pedo granny
>Perverted old mare
Meanwhile.....hm......that was actually a rather accurate observation.....you win 1 point. But you lose 2 for being inferior.
grannycloud

Poor Rainbow

When you think about it, Rarity's actions actually caused RD to win the competition.
derpy
8crimsonrisk: wut
*smacks crimsonrisk, no that ruins all my plans foal!!
You heard me
true
dr whooves w/ wings?
Gonna try to keep track of Ditzy's number. I never seem to remember which one it is.
*bow*
@Crimson: wishful thinking.
I predict there will be many ruined pants when Derpy makes her first BG appearance in S2
john madden
HEIL CELESTIA
Hipster, Crimson is drunk
Where be Luna?
*trollestia*
LIES
Pony Bullies = Beavis and Butt-Head
Actually, Rainbow might have been able to do it if she had her own music and not Rarity's

did celestia ever appologise for sending her to the moon for 1000 years?
i feel like playing angry magic to this XD
I think so
she said he missed her
I think that this PMV took film that was too direct to the lyrics..
but she never said "oops my bad"
that bitch.
Celestia is a tyrant, yes.
You know if any thing I am looking forward to S2 just bacause it will give pmv makes more footage to work with.
even though i love luna, i think celestia did what she had to do...
ok this is pretty cool http://tinycartridge.com/post/9518601263/snowspeeder-snes-and-tie-fighter-n64-by

Xaneco is right.

moon sis
Darken, those are AWESOME>

Sad, because one of my first dances was with this song..
I hate Glee
._. yeah
I like this song alot
no one was born to be a slave, see the past and place the blame, tell me the color of the rain, no one was born to be a master, in the land we live, we die, face the oneness, face the lie, to find the will around the faker, we will need a true rain maker...
Honestly, I really don't get the whole "I used to like this, but then a bunch of obnoxious people ruined it for me."
A LOT.
one of mine as well, ff29
You'd think people would be more upset with the obnoxious people than with the thing they used to like.
quill
its to bind a web around the faker
i still like the song... but i got sick of people singing it a school...
yeahh
lol
mind screw...
yeah I agree
link please??
I think about how we look at our past, specifically music. We look back on Journey and other bands with nostalgia. But then, what music will be our generation's "journey"? What will the future look back to
hrmm
when I see the choices available...I weep for the future...
yeah...
Our Future better not look back to that Dubstep shit :.
may i have a link please?

and then all of a sudden people started turning out these shit remixes
hipsters ruined it
and people like bassnecter who are mediocresp?
dubstep was around when i was in like middle school
ValtheJean. that was so hipster, yet true.
._.

7u mad?
aeiou
human*
i hate the voice
Yes
*mute*

I FIND THIS KIND OF THING REPUGNANT
rave...

I HAVE BEEN A BRONY FOR 7 MONTHS

If Sathi really wanted to troll us, she could hijack the stream for a month and air nonstop Bieber.
hey can you play that song one more time?
his mother came up with such a clever way t save the day with a little white lie...
Thunt went through that for most of April and it nearly drove him mad.
Dusk
I
Dont
Even
father said im sorry only once as i remeber, the words werent meant to hurt only destroy you my stupid son...
Want to ever imagine that
:)
I know, it was terrible.
People were actually begging him to stop because it was like torturing himself.
/me 7headbangs
yes, another goblin pony
/me headbangs too.
i dont get why people hate Scoots
My brain is shutting down. I need more ponies to keep it alive.
@Luna: \m/
Scoots is a boss.
*headbangs* i think for the same reason
never again will I see sing this in front of a huge crowd.
APPLEBLOOM IS TEH SHIZNIT
Scoots is okay, I kinda like her..
though you would think scoot and rainbow dash would rather be guy ponies
She's not as cute as Apple Bloom or Sweetie Belle, and her strong qualities don't really shine through much.
fair nuff Shine
Sweetie Belle is my favorite CMC
but shes funny. Good voice
I don't know why, Scootaloo is my favorite filly though
i know. but that's what makes her special ;d
she's so adorable...
why would being tomboyish equate to wanting to be male?
well Val
that's the same stereotypes Lauren wanted to remove :P
its pretty obvious
i like scoots too, people dont be hating on my third fav tomboy
I actually want to see this song get a reprise, 'cause from what I've heard Scootaloo's VA is actually a good singer.
I like My Little Pony. Do I now want to be female?
Don't expect a response out of me.
Nope.avi
Nah breh
7do you Val?
dontbecrazy.jpg
depending on you as a person
Hmm... nag.
nah*
@Luna: <.< >.>
I'm comfortable havingg a penis.

I thought I heard some Castlevania Birds in there for a moment.
Hallo
I think I'm going crazy.
possibly
biggest tomboy i knew became quite girly come puberty
so yeh
Were all going tired crazy
(caleb)
pfft
i had like
Someone link this please?
the ponies ended over an hour ago lol...
2 fucking bottles of OJ and some lemonade
I'm just saying, gender roles are really harmful to society
Agreed, Val.
^
quite the contrary actually
7TrollightSparkle: PM
Val is right
I mean, maybe I'm a bit biased considering I grew up as a choir student, so I kinda always had the gay card flashed at me
mhh OJ
Hmm?
its one of the reasons society has lasted so long
7you should see a button / tab on top of the chat with my name
thepunchlineismachismo had a good back and forth that i enjoyed
Seriously! I can hear it!
across the sea i hear you calling me, for the sake of revenge you remind me...
I say society needs to end, but not like anarchy, I'd prefer death over anarchy..
I press pm but nothing happens
I despise Castlevania Birds, Castlevania Birds are my darkest. Nightmare.
explained just why Gender roles were albeit necessary to society
... I can hear it.
Why can I hear it?!
well I'll have to politely agree to disagree PC
Oh
Hurr dur
:D
Yeah, nothing wrong with that
._.
i'll link the article if i can find it
durrrrr\
der[
not an article really
ANYWAYS
I need sleep...
But I HAVE PONIES.
choose wisely my son...
and thats all u need FF29...thats all ull ever need
I have. Ponies outweigh this. I can use the excuse "I hate mondays" and it'll work..
sorry but like food, and sleep and soda and money too
I miss soda
and beer
mostly beer
... anyways I feel a bit lazy to go trudge through archives
vodka?
to find something
*perfers wine to beer*
I miss.. not much.
*stills waits for Recruitment form response*
7agrees with Xaneco
> gave up drinking a few months ago
My bronies.. ponies may be life, but sleep is second to none.
14Ew, beer. Not much a drinker myself, but I prefer wine too.
*prefers vodka since it's the only alcohol he's ever had, coz he's 15..*
g'night
/me has only ever drank wine and white wine in the past.
lol ff29
=/ Really want to try Applejack in the future.
wine has a much more complex flavor...
... wine coolers and white wine*
I don't always drink, but right now, I'm smashed on rum.
I'd like to have a taste of Applejcak myself..
oh wait.
@Octavia wine is very nice. Though it's usually a bit out of my price range. At least, the kinds that are worth drinking
lol
:D
7ValtheJean: no cheap spanish wine?
*eats fried chicken*
i've found some really cheap good wines ._.
@Luna: ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
7hahahaha
boxed wines explode if you put them in a microwave..

which reminds me
Apparently Scootaloo's VA is actually a really good singer

It was hard for me to watch this imo, I don't know why.
13Sathi, what servers you play on on WoW btw?
SO WE TEST OUR TALENTS EVERYWHERE
UNTIL OUR FACE IS BLUE
now that is IRONY
I used to play WoW.

The first time I watched this I couldn't stop fidgeting.
The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention.
Don't really like wow
CMC FILLYFOOLERS! YAY
13Or wait, cant remember if it was you who was streaming when that popped up or not...
when i first watched this i just felt...awkward...

Xaneco, that's me
cool
Ive been playing WoW since 1 month after Vanilla came out, its getting really old
13Know of any active Brony guilds? I joined Moon Guard because I was told there was on on there, but I think it may have died.
7I quit recently
7it's the same over and over
yeah
7waiting for guildwars 2
i quit, then came back...
i stayed on since my arena bro payed for my time
7but I heard it's gonna look like a wow clone more and more
but i'm waiting for Skyrim...
13Eh, I take breaks. But I get back into it a while later.
waiting for skyrim and innistrad magic release...
/me is sick of the two troll heroics
SKYRIM.
Just a bit off topic, but does anybody still play Crysis?
SKYRIMMMM
Crysis 2 is fun
i play crysis two...
Ew
sliding like a boss
SKYRIIIIMMMMMMMMMMMMMm
aw yeah elder scrolls
13Most MMORPGs aspire to be like WoW with how popular and big it is.
SKYYYYYRIM
Crysis 2 is Call of Crysis: Future Warfare
Morrowind is the best
And UNCHARTED 3
Skyrim? Morrowind is best pony
word
morrowind was awesome
Hey, anyone here do modding for FO3?
anyone who disagrees is a monster
treasure hunting ftw
i still like daggerfall...
yeah sotha
wats SKyrim?
I asked you last night
if Sotha was from Morrowind
Elder Scrolls
Sotha Sil, clockword god.
clockwork~
daggerfall and arena hurt me ..but i beat them anyway...
elder scrolls V
skyrim
I'll be honest, I'm pyshed for Skyrim..
SKYRIMM!M!!!!!
preordered
me too
I know it's blasphemy, but I've never played Elder SCrolls.. ._.
can't wait
yeah
me 2
..........
I had the same issues with Daggerfall's world as I did Oblivion's. They felt too much like stereotypical renaissance RPG worlds, whereas Morrowind's was original and magical (friendship).
i dont ahve anything to play V on
I'm poor, so Pirating is my only chance herE~

I so totally screwed up the main story line in my first playthrough of Morrowind. I killed Vivec when I was level 7 (because he's afraid of Dwemer weapons, for some reason), and then I accidentally killed Yagrum Bagarn, which meant it was impossible for me to get the wraith guard. So then I became a vampire and murdered everyone in three major cities
to you
wildfire, sonata arctica...
lol
I fucked it up
Sweet night of pony!
by killin stuff in the courpusysm
eehhh... not a fan of vampire anymore...
before talking to the guy
Thanks suffuri! I'll have to give ya something sometime, though~
I think i'll do anything under 10$ on steam every weekend or every other
And when I became a high enough level to go into Red Mountain, I stole the other artifacts, and discovered an exploit that allows you to use them without becoming mortally wounded (by removing them from your inventory with good timing), and won the game. Yeah~
on here for someone random
lawllll
fuck it i killed hircine
That's mighty nice of you :D
then broke the game
we all are forced to obey...

but still...
A little slower and more precise with the chopsticks...
I'm using just my thumb to type everything...
It works very well...

Nope, just one...
6It's less about accuracy and more about how sensitive the keys are to being pressed, I would think.

Morning everypony
morn'n, AllisZero
So I pretty much had massive insomnia at night singing Winter Wrap-up in my head
Why is that song so damn catchy
heh
Haha man this is surprising
And funny too
oh?
My drawing of Lil' mac has become more popular than any other drawing I have on my DA page, even more than the WoW drawing I have from seven months ago
And it's hardly been 36 hours since posted
That's the power of this fandom!
lol sounds about right
Yeah, surprising though
/me is playing Metro 2033
hey, wasn't that on your wishilst?
wishlist *
Dermathil: awesome! i'm halfway through ^_^
what up, brownies?
Morning RP!
mornin', AllisZero
I'm amazed that
Even ponies can't make Firday good
RobotPinkie!
hey RP
and, Firday?
yo Daz
and hi GGgala
you styled FS yet?
rebeca black's song
Not yet, no. How'd yours go, Daz?
you mean how it's going?
oh. Friday. i was thinking 'the day you shop for a fir tree for Xmas'
Yeah
it's currently Uh, i mean, SHE'S currently drying off on a plate.
Oh okay
gonna brush a little more, then rubberband her hair and take her to the shower =D
the hair styling still a WIP then, Daz?
anyone know if Val finished reading FO:E?
of course
and i dont know RobotPinkie
Pinkie's holding up surprisingly well, even though she's standing next to a fan.
still looking epic with curls? :3
and also, i've decided to go get RD and RF on wednesday =D
and i got a toothbrush for brushieing. do you still recommend those pins thou? and curlers?
sounds like pinkie pie!
I used pins and drinking straws, Daz
One pin to keep the hair in place while curling the hair up, and another to keep it in place once curled tight.
i see. i'll try dat when i need it :P
ah okie. I have those :P also i'm thinking of trying something: sticking about 3-4mm of (inb4 sexual jokes) a cocktail stick where FS's tail comes out. this way, the hair can come out a little UP before drooping down, like he show
p.s. it works i've tried it, just haven't done the rest of tail / hair.
Ah okay, might to that too if it works well
yea well i may get FS finished today, i think i can actually. so pics when done ; )
She looks okay for now, have too much reading to do for test this week to do a proper job.
i know i've been going slowly, but i been busy >_<. ah you've been busy too? :P
Looking forward to seeing the result
lol yeah, test on Wednesday
OMAGAD XENOBLADE IS HERE
Xenoblade?!
XENOBLADE!!!
a wii videogame
oh, here as in the mail?
eyup! just arrived
gonna play on the wii a little, but fret not, laptop next to tv (dunno if you've seen my pics)
i don't think so?
:(
Oh yeah, that's right
http://i.imgur.com/GeHHp.jpg
I postede about 10 pics, here's one thou
the sorta overview one of my desk =D
ah, excellent. still got the N64 i see :D
it's a little different rite now as I say, daisy is now unpacked, and FS is drying on a plate
...i might take multiple pics of FS as I go actually
...do it, colt
:P teehee
sounds like a plan, to document the process
well i missed out a bit from when hair was a huge mess to all straight like now, but yea i'll dothat. i'll start after I finish trying out xenoblade / when dad wakes up from siesta. whichever comes first
RobotPinkie: do you have more pics, or them three so far?
I should've taken more, but no, those are the ones I have :(
ah well
oh dad just woke up. okie i'll play a little first ^_^ then BRUSHIE TIEMZ
I should take one of Dewdrop Dazzle, her hair is really surprisingly nice...
sounds like a plan, Daz :P
so wuu2 GGgala and RobotPinkie?
wuu2?
/me had to look up what wuu2 meant, heh
"what are you up to"
eyup
lolol oh okay
/me feels left out
not much, playing Limbo
I'm stuck on the ladder puzzle...
not much here either, cleaning up a bit, thinking of playing a bit of Time Crisis
LIMBO! i played like 2 hours of that! still gotta complete it. and i used to play time crisis all the time at arcades :P
pew pew pew
AllisZero: lol. and what're you up to?
wuu2 AllisZero? :P
inclusion herdmind
/me feels included!
hurray
yay!
OOH Daz. do you remember the ladder on wheels, or did you not get to that part?
Working, unsurprisingly. Setting up a laptop for one of my users, buying some more
The usual boring work routine
Time Crisis was always everyone's favorite at the arcade indeed
eeyup. at our arcade, too.
well, next to Jurassic Park.
GGgala: uuummm? ladder on wheels? I got th the part where 3 dudes chase you and try to kill you, and these crushers from the ceiling take them out
ladder on wheels?
Daz: ah. so i'm further than you
never mind
it comes later
It's the PS3 collection thing with Time Crisis 4, Time Crisis: Razing Storm and Deadstorm Pirates... It's pretty cool.
you're still in the wet cave
yah
dat headless corpse in the water, man
still need to get Limbo...
i no rite GGgala
de implications
suddenly, piano intro. HEADPHONES are going in! (tv and the wii game incase you were confused :P)
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/505.jpg

Wrek: i read 'through the eyes of another pony' now btw
nice
and?
daz'
RobotPinkie: lawl
Very well written, and I am very very afraid for Luna :(
?*
;___; like really afraid
Hey Daz, let me know if that game's as good as I'm reading it is?
sure man!
watching intro nao
alright, cyall soon.
Yeah, I'd have to import it, but it might be worth the trouble if it gets me entertained
Leaving again for school
im getting a peak at p5 in an hour, is gona be so /)^3^(\
bai Dermathil
Later Dermathil
cya Dermathil
later Dermathil
AllisZero: dayum. what an intro
and Wrek wrote a fanfic, I guess?
RobotPinkie, nah, but he did 2 artworks for it and recommended it to me
daz, did ya play any yet?
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/story-through-eyes-of-another-pony.html
Ah okay. lol I still haven't read much of DCD's fic, yet
Wrek: I haven't played any yet
silly filly
D: inorite, it's just so hard for me to sit down and do it for some reason >_<
i will though
hehe
ne way p5 gona be awesum
Kinda hard to take the time now, most fics are just so damn long...
which is why i havent read fallout eq yet
still, i'm very sad for Luna rite now ;__; i liek Luna
dont worry shell *spoiler*
>.>
Wrek, do you know what happens?
y
Looks like my kind of game
proofreader?
She'll attach spoilers to her car, so don't worry too much.
y
AllisZero: still introductory section so i'll keep you posted :P
Wrek: i wanna know! >_<
Sure, thank yoou
n
y y n
Man, yeah...
THis fandom has just thrown a LOT of my preconceptions out of the water in 10 seconds flat
Put them all together, and it spells "whinny"
lawl
on the phone, keeping it simple
AllisZero: which ones?
omagad camera just flew around and it's a HUGEASS world :
:P
I really never liked the idea of fanfiction; now I'm compelled to read them
heh. oh, that one.
i see Wrek on the /phone/ :P Did luna really absorb everything that's on the internet? or just thes tuff saved on the phone?
And I was never much of a pack animal but hanging out with my bronies feels so right
Actually with FiM is the first time I'm reading fanfiction and kind of enjoying it...
ikr AllisZero
all teh intrnt
Wrek: BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
IMPOSSIBRU
well good morning, how are mah bronies today?
all that info, all that bronyism, about other planets, LIFE, religion, science, pornography, gore/shocking stuff, 4chan and other such sites, the ideas of rape, theft and murder, NO WAI
90% of the internet is now pictures of Luna in socks.
ohai ValtheJean
Morning Val
hey ValtheJean
hai Daz....and what on earth did I miss? lol
how'd the reading of fanfic go?
Poor Luna then
hello Allis, Robotpinkie
or are you now barred from saying anything, ValtheJean? :P
lol nah I finished it now
so now I have every right to say it's a large pile of shit
lololol
AllisZero: the music is top notch
I take it that's your verdict, then? :P
This is my non-objective (non-flaming rage response):
luna :(
bwahaha
Wrek: WHat's gonna happen with Luna? D:
It's exactly what I would expect of a fanfic. It's someone with a competent understanding of the English language. Because it isn't completely unreadable, it's mistaken for high quality. That in of itself does not excuse that it is, indeed, a low quality work of writing
tell me what you think of the fic as a whole
it had two or three incorrectly used phrases too : /
but the fic is an awesome fic
brb coffee break
Well, I'll see if I ever read it, ValtheJean, it seems way too long though...
don't bother RobotPinkie
just don't
lololol
I might do that, actually, since I don't have that much time for reading anyway :P
also ohai wrek (delayed sorry, just woke up :P)
there is ALWAYS time for reading young one!
hi
just read quality material :P
Besides, I've got some Dickens that needs rereading...
and I'm a year older than you, Val...
(quoting fluttershy)
lol
I was about to say "You have no idea how old I am"
/me totally is now slowpoke.jpg today
That's true, you might be older.
lol...when I get back from class I'll have my rapier wit sharpened and ready to go! :P
In which case you're more Fluttershy than me...
:P more fluttershy. fluttershy now an adjective :3
I am? Oh...um...if that's alright with you...
silly daz, everyone knows that nouns are adjectives :P
Fluttershy is also an adverb
:P
she's like... everything... except food
I like pudding...
I like turtles
o u
Time to go buy something caffeinated before my brainwaves collapse
already? it's not even night time!
I didn't sleep that well last night. and it's like... 5pm
I got coffee!
there
at home now
I'll be back in a few
welcome back wrek and allis :P
also damn timezones robotpinkie! DAMN THEM TO HELL!
Whoa 5 Pm? 11 AM here!
AllisZero: it's pretty good so far. not 'thisisthebest' so far though, it's very good though
9:00 am here
I'll see if I can import that, Daz
Along with After Century's Episode R for the PS triple
I usually love games for their stories
/me slept a bit to long
But having fun counts too
Hai Pinkie

as i told dunno who a while ago, i suspect my graph arts teacher of beeing a brony
courses? embarrassing?
nothing conclusive
but
oh, that would be awesome
GGgala Is Deramathil still out of power?
RDash: he lost power juuust before showtime too
He might pick up on it but be too embarrassed to display it publicly, Wrek
Wrek
Well, at least he has power now.
Something disturbing has invaded the internet.
I lost power All. Day.

I think somepony made one with Brony snickers or something like that
Some other food product
hmm.. i don't think i've seen that
I cant find it. I think that one is just as much or even more suggestive :P
I'd give Twi all my brony cola!
There was one posted on EQD, shes' a package of something

Second link worked, Pinkie_Pie?
I havent played any of the silent hill games.
Yeah it did
I started the play SH2 the other day
But then I got in the hotel and couldnt find the flashlight
So I stopped, and havent gotten the guts to go back in
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8lzIUkm77w&feature=player_embedded
Ah okay. I really recommend playing Silent Hill 1-3... I love those games.
Silent Hill 4 is kinda skippable, it wasn't even meant to be a Silent Hill game...

Twitchatwitch!
One second
Lemme find something
lol yeah I've seen that one
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/a0f30dfe2ec8c6ae6b8d3bc991989ada/50970%20-%20luna%20sad%20socks.png
Poor Luna, out of work since Episode 2. :(
That's mean
She's crying too ;_;
Although I just don't like her voice
i laughed i cried.. i wore socks
Well, she'll be on more in Season 2...
I hope she's actually made a permanent mane 6 character.
Well, mane 7 at that point
then everyone would be hating on the devs for fighting is magic saying that they hate luna
and fighting is magic would stop development
Eh
Can't make everyone happy
People will complain and fight for ANYTHING
I dunno, I think Mane 6 works as it is, but I would like to see more of some other characters on the show.
but the funny thing is.. cancelling a fighting game CAUSES the fighting
then the irony appreciators are happy
lOl
Luna and Celestia would probably be overpowered characters anyway :p
nah.. they've outgrown their fighting spirit which the younger ones still have
i'm just throwing out ideas to make them not seem OP
Well, so much that could be done for and against
There's hardly any point in trying to make the point for either or
Have they definitely said they won't have Luna?
In other news, how the hell do I set up a DHCP relay agent for a network on my Fortigate router. Tune in next week for another exciting episode of systems adminman
That sounds like an exciting episode
i had an awesome idea for a fanfic
not that i could write it
of course it's a crossover.. with final fantasy unlimited
Haven't seen that show, unfortunately.
well i think just from that people know where i'm going with my idea lol
if anyone who has seen it is reading this anyway
I haven't, so I can't comment much on it
alright then that brings me to my other idea..
kingdom hearts crossover
but that's probably been done
The one idea for a fanfic I've had is about a pony who, despite being way past the age of getting a cutie mark, never actually got one. So in meeting the mane 6, shenanigans ensue.
lol that's pretty nice actually
Buuuut probably been done too.
an idea i had for an RPG is this
Moral of the story is that she'd be pretty average at everything she does, but not exceptionally good at anything
"they said my cutie mark could be anything.. so it became everything"
Hmm
They told me I could be anything I wanted, so I became a god!
To the #Bunker !
lol that kid just looks perfect for that picture
lol yah

Nope.avi
Reaver, we are trying to put up some on synchtube
Its just getting a bit to complicated..

Sychtube is complicated some reason the comments won't show up in my room
Twilight
lol oh okay, Daz :P
You need to refresh the page
I see. Thanks, pinkie_pie!
it's cute, RobotPinkie, and it's my 2 fave ponies, so i likies it very much
(RobotPinkie you may have heard I wanted Twi and Luna more than any other merch if you remembar :P)
Me too, best bed meme pic I've seen... even though it's not funny.
not funny? i thought it wasn't funny, but cute <3
pinkie_pie what's going on?
I have no idea
wow this place really has gone quiet.

Do it
I need some House right now
House would work!
Eeyup. I actually feel like watching House today.
Luna, are you still Sathi, or another mod?
but are you coming back to the stream pinkie_pie?

MeteorVenture

I think it has me as the mod?
Im not sure
Looks like you're mod in both rooms.
ohhhh lol ok
I have a picture of twilight next to my name.. Like it thinks im you
wth?
So...how do I get to the Synchtube stream?
Now unnamed is mod..
http://synchtu.be/4NJX
Type in your name, TwilightSparkle, and maybe unnamed can give it to you.
That one is mine, we are trying to get twilights working
(might be me, I'm unnamed)
gimme a second to set things up
Say something in the chat Robot
7and yes i'm Sathi
lol. FF29 here, I never actually got sleep :/
Well I typed in my name.
Twilight
Just come in your room
Robot will give you mod
Did you reload and type your name in under the chat?
I'm gonna watch House, though :P
Robot
Twilight is in the chat
Ok everything is right now :D
Okay, last class of the day done, finally
stream's up
:3
WOONA
7music working?
Seems so, yeah
/me 4is tired
Volume's good too
'sup Ghosties
4YESSSSSSSSS
4Love this video
4Hey RP

4So House
4AND IT LOOPS
Haha, oh wow

hihi

Sound's very low for me
OOPS!
umm what?
DAMNIT!
wtf?
ohhhh
Much better now, thanks
7your welcome
lol,heya
/me meows at Sathi
Yeah, pretty low here. Watching two tubes... This and Synchtube, which is suffering from some Mod trouble..?
hey um, do u know a short url i can give to a friend who wants to connect via his phone?
7will push the volume up a bit more in 10 mins
Does anyone have a playlist of all 26 mlp episodes on youtube or something?
7bf going to bed
lol okay
comments not showing up again but if I refresh it will make somepony else the mod
If you create an account you can have a room that's tied to you, so you don't lose leader status.
Twilight
A random unnamed has mod
-.-
Why must synchtube torture us?!
It's so weird..
honestly, I would just suggest having him take the extra time and set up a dedicated client
assuming it is a smartphone
if not, then jmirc would be his only option
or a mobile friendly web app I am not aware of
i dont have the faintest idea what it is.
can you ask him?
This rediculous
lol just did
he's gta txt back
7smart patient
A bit TOO smart, perhaps
She Crazy.
Aw, broadcast offline for m
me
7dinkypage is up
7http://dinkypage.com/bronystate
Lol, I've been on Dinkypage at THE SAME TIME!!! :D
he doesnt know what it is but its not a smartphone.
Eeyup. Medical...stuff.
Backkkk
:D
Hi people :)
Fuu dinkypage isn't loading either
Hi person!
^_^
/me pokes VampirePrincess
/me pokes back
who == cookie?
Open adblock plus, block everything from scripts.hashemian.com, page now loads!
my <3
It will, just VERY VERY slowly. It takes me about a minute for the chat service and Stream to pop up..
Wouldn't load for me either before I did that...
I mean
On the nick list
RP, you're kidding me.
Odysseus?
he's not here yet!
Kidding? No. Page loads instantly for me now.
I'm going to do that now.
Good tip RP
i need help getting him here. he's tryin to connect via his phone and its not a smart phone.
If you want to see the countdown again you'll have to unblock it, I guess, but countdown doesn't work ATM...
It works! YOU'RE MY SAVIOR, ROBOTPINKIE!!!
Well there's your problem
np, Reaver21 :D
as long as it is not MetroPCS, it should be able to use jMIRC
Can't connect to IRC on a rotary phone
it has internet.
So, out of curiosity, do you know what those scripts did, and why they made the page take *pikiepie voice* FOREVER!!!! to load?
/me and cookie are confused.
does not matter, MetroPCS has their shit locked down tighter than a monestary full of virgins next to a nightclub
I think it's just the script for the countdown timer under "time until next stream"
lol
lLOL
YEAH
/me rubs his head
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER BRAIN ALRIGHT
ouch
Seriously? Why the hell would it do that!? :D
and hashemian.com is down and can't load, that's why it takes forever
Ahhh. I see!
7for-ever!
Mod trouble AGAIN
lol :P
soooo, its a no go with him connectin on his phone?
seriously though, Metro PCS and their line of dumbphones are impossible for the average layman to work with
only if he is using MetroPCS
Reaver
I was able to get jMIRC running on a pre smartphone era blackberry
Check PMs
You should register on synchtube, TwilightSparkle, that way you can tie a room to yourself.
on the Now Netowkr with Sprint
has to be a new room, unfortunately...
I tried getting jMIRC to work on a friends MetroPCS dumbphone...impossible
I registered for Synchtube, so..
man things are boring in this office without our director of project management
Yeah I'm guessing this is like... the one time House is wrong.
She was as close to Pinkie Pie as you can get without being a cartoon character
Alliszero, what kind of project? :O
Websites and stuff
7AllisZero: you want me in?
he's gto straight talk.
/me 7is a project manager
got*
VampirePrincess: Short answer, unless he can figure something out, then no
is that a carrier?
If you're close to florida I'm sure they're hiring :D
network
Phones + IRC == tough to set up\
I see. OOHHH SHE JUST CALLED HER A BEYYYEEETCH
>inb4 bananas
It was tough for me to set up with my phone -- I had to use some computer science wizardry
I'm actually in Savannah Georgia, not really close, I think.
Munchausen's syndrome involves bananas?
:/ I flit between AndroIRC and Andchat. on my blackberry it was jMirc all the way, though that was less straightforward
Why would it not?
And each phone is different... especially the pre-Android generations
VampirePrincess, get me the name/model of his phone, I will see what options he has
4Strange
Vhat is?
Hmmm, bananas are kinda close to orange...
4I can't get the stream
refresh?
Ghosties, that is strange. Coz' I'm getting it..
ohai bronies! How are you today?
'sup ValtheJean
Delectable, Val.
howdy robotpinkie
I was on like forever ago.
Under FF29.

HAHA, oh god
Check PM Val
What happened with that hunty guy? I know it was all a joke, but still how'd it end?

Congrats valthejean!
(I really can't read what you say, though)
2unfortunately, it was either that or:
15this
/me 7is manually selecting Val's lines
15which sprinkles wouldn't let me take >.<
Lolz.
yeah, but he aint at home and we cant figure out his phone. i'm tlkin to him via txts thru gmail. sooooo.... yeah.
So does this mean I'm gonna get kicked every time I post this? http://i.imgur.com/62DMj.png
Ouch.
Well, that means no more mods needed, I guess?
2must....resist....
lol, Dashite, I would ki-
i might be able to become a streamer
lol no :D
well apply
Once he gets home?
/me is gonna have to be nicer to Val now. :/
i'll probably not be here. and i'm the reason he's coming to irc.
7carry on Decap
2@Dashite: trolololo
7i'm listening
butbutbut... he loves me :o
Dat badass House
Computer lab?
I really can't see Valthejeans' text..
Damn you Val!
Me neither, lol
/me 2is the ultimate troll
Eeenope. :p
he's not a student. and he's nvr met u.
So, what just happened?
In House?
Valthejean got promoted to half op
House gave drug cocktail to patient.
I hate this.
Wow. That was dramatic. On House, yes.
Hate what now?
/me 2's messages are also ubr ninja now
Valthejean is susceptible to corruption. I wait patiently for this to happen.
He's also weak against black backgrounds, I hear.
But he still loves me O:
2:P
I already registered on sychtube and It STILL gives mod to somepony else.
Hey Val, say something.
You can't take leader status back, TwilightSparkle? Weird...
lol, idk... ur my ex, he's my man.... not sure how thts gna go.
Preferably something that isn't an emoticon.
something that isn't an emoticon. wait what now?
ugh
2I am the night
She doesn't look like a happy camper...
Damn.
lol
I even created a NEW ROOM!
mfw he didn't even get a warning. odd
butbutbut
/me hugs him
YFW he's a new mod...
it annoys me that territorial behavior is ever present in our species' psyche
I dunno what's wrong then, TwilightSparkle, sorry :(
/me hugs back
Where?
2<.< >.>
like with my ex. when she learned I was dating someone new, she was rather furious, even though we had ended the relationship
I kinda miss ValtheJean :(
she still considered me to be hers, even though I told her we could not be more than friends
oh
Sychtube sucks soooo bad
i am so confused right now. going to go back to trying to find my save files from mardek
/me shrugs
None of my business
But I like meeting new people :3
and it disheartens me to learn that Vamp's bf may consider you to be a threat to him
or at least that is what she fears
He won't after I hug him
REAVER
hugs > psychology
METEOR
I HAVE TO REFRESH>>
OH GOD WHAT I DO?
lolol
/me is rolling the dough
LOL.
lol, were it that simple
Jayne has the mod now
some people are seriously dumbasses
this girl i work with
Of course the One person that isn't posting at all...
she comes up to me and my supervisor while we were talking
and asks us
"how do you make a new salt and pepper shaker?"
Reaver
Your little AFK...
Now you have it
Awesome. How do I give?
can no one think for themselves...
LOL
Poor girl
and im cooking stuff
Hover over name and click give leadership
and she comes behind me
and is all like "your making some food"
Oh. Ibrony, right?
my supervisor looks at me and is all like... this i why i want to kill myself sometimes.
wow.
people like that shouldn't be allowed in areas with open flames, sharp objects and slippery floors.
gokaiger!?
no one thinks for themselves they always think they need to ask about the stupidest things
2hahaha
Oh it's invisible Val's welcome vid
2dat trollin Sathi
i just stand around all day and talk to my supervisor because shes kind of cute :P
7it's the welcome song for our new team-member
/me 2dances
what do you cook?
fast food at a waterpark.
2I don't care how the tradition started, I love it :P
mmmmm, I love fast food
so, like burgers, hotdogs, fried stuff?
but we have one sitdown resturaunt type part where they put me because everyone else is too much of a dumbass.
lol
ever deep fry something which isn't normally deep fried?
maybe..
It keeps changing how do I register cause I swore I registered
Im kind of bored there now though
probably wont go back next year
Did you log in, also?
isn't that why people work waterparks? :3
*facedesk*
eh i gave her my number, if shes interested she can call.
YES
LOL
I probably seen more bikinis in one season than you have seen your entire life.
No idea, then.
all the females hang out at the lifeguard tower, and all the guys watch all the bikini-clad women going down the water slides
Twilight, something keeps happening that causes something to mess up
Why disqualify the rush?
(their breasts fall out usually)
I wanted to keep admin so that it doesnt get given to someone who wont give it back when that happens
lol
all the water safety people here are mostly kids.
Well, I'ma be hiding in synchtube.
they are called water safety because they dont have a lifeguarding certificate.
oh.
SOUNDS LEGIT
they have a whistle and yell at people
kind of like me, but without the whistle.
one of these summers I'm just going to get a month pass or something and sneak a keg in there with my buddies
Oh he mad...
they told me if i came back next year id get a supervisory position
so im like
we'll float around all day
you mean I have to come in at 8:30am and leave at 9pm?
hell no.
im gonna try to sign out and sigh in again
but you get keys :|
Curly, you didnt visit me at the waterpark this year.
keys are the most useful thing evar
7poor guy
omg you are in vancouver?
I already hacked their register system.
how do they have water parks?
no, an hour away.
no
vancouver != snow
lol
it hardly snowed at all last year

it wasnt cold enough
I have a beard.
I still need to find milk in a bag
ahh

edmonton is really cold

Well, I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you
buh byes!!
I basically just met her in class today and was talking old shakespearean english and she mentioned FF6 to the teacher then I mentioned Who she said there were 11 of them.
Pretty promising this far.
Sounds pretty good
EEEEYUP
11?

11 doctors
All the same.
Ah
I mentioned Doctor Who

I hope you've also hung up the elitist view of gaming that you had
YAR HAR FIDDLE DEE DEE

7First of all he applied
House is awesome.
THIIIIIIIS is WHIIIIIIIIIIINIIIIIIIING
>mfw I APPLIED TOO
He applied, and he fulfilled their requirements, presumably.
Sathi: Details details
Q__________Q
you too robotpinkie
You're not elitist enough, Dermathil!
Silly applications
I consider elitism a bad habit. Causes people to become distant with the harshness of reality.
I like having white text, so... not gonna apply :P
House will MESS YOU UP over those animal crackers

It's okay, she gave her bananas
http://miburl.com/YGVzne
2I see. Hurray for moon streams!
Nah, Sathi is Dutch......... oh I see your point, DecapPony
lololol
Again, totally worth the repost Decap :]
7Dutchies evil?
7:(

2How can anyone who likes cats be evil?
Naw, that'd mean I'm half evil, Sathi :P
...do you think I'm evil?
didnt Dr. Evil like cats?
or I mean Luna, not Sathi
7you evil?
7Nah
7Hmmmmmm

Y'know, she's NOT an evil.
7DecapPony: did you get my PM?
yeah, i dont have the money to get the equipment
7I thought you said you would
7but oh well thanks for the app either way
Equipment? Is this classified? :0
very, and now you must die
nah I'm sure Decap has the Hub where he lives
i do
and he had applied to stream the show
YOU CAN'T KILL ME IF YOU CAN'T CATCH ME
/me jumps out window
7that's why i'm confused
/me shoots herospirit

SON OF A BITCH, MY LIVER
i confuse people a lot
its my talent
im like psyduck
Tox screen says you're cool, too!
I need a doctor...
nah you'll be fine
Or a liver. I'd do with a liver
7tell me, what seems to be the problem?
Decap shot me.
he has lupus dr!
7the best treatment for that would be friend and magic
Dr-Luna: I think I might be having a medical emergency, too
7friendship & magic*
I have no magic...
or friends.
2"AAAAAHHHHH My knee hurts....GIVE ME THE MORPHINE!"
*sob*
7being here is both
so is he SOL doc?
I'm severly lacking friends, can I have a prescription for pot?
Sounds like it decap.
I have a serious hug deficiency, and only Princess Luna can help :(
/me 7hugs everyone in the box
/me 2hugs Dr-Luna
Oh well, I had a short, uneventful life. Oh wait
i have a serious vodka deficiency
Ahhh, much better.
2NOW GIVE ME MY MORPHINE
/me would rather have a prescription for medicinal marijuana
7the only prescription I can give you is watch ponies
Mind if I ask what kind of mod duties mods have, Dr-Luna?
while i drink vodka?
that's good too
7that's basically all you need
2Ponies are a hell of a drug
7RobotPinkie: PM me please for a personal diagnosis
But Dr-Luna what about my vodka deficiency?
House is the smoothest
Dr. Troll
By the way, I found a spare liver in Pinkie's basement. I'm good now
Wut
so thats where my old liver went!
7heh
Delicious, delicious livers
7did you kept it cold?
Someone taped a few icecubes to it
good enough?
But Dr-Luna what about my vodka deficiency?
I just hope the previous owner wasn't an alcoholic.
well that was my liver
so yes
extremly
Fuck.
House is such an ass
7House discovers friendship but blocks it
House = Discord?
nah thats me
He's just awkward around people
especially kids
Decap, you're way too drunk to be a proper Archvillain
:0
i disagree, i feel just drunk enough to be a proper archvillain
FUUUUUUUUUU-
She's giving birth to a blood demon!
Obviously.
its just that Dr-Luna wont give me any vodka for my deficiency
I have water
If I said it was vodka, would you believe me?
no
well im probally going to die
Going home bronies
7Decap you need to de-tox
See you all later.
Cya Zero
ohai/obai Zero

He's here about Stacy bro

CRIPPLE POWERS
Cripple used climb. It's not very effective.
...help

Let's all leave the cripple on the stairs
That's probably what he said next
7DecapPony: too much alcohol is never good for you
I GOT IT. SHE'S GONNA SELL THE BABY!
7you should know this
only if i can have a hug
/me 7hugs DecapPony

Yup, Silvermane
Oops
Forgot to erase "Being"
It only exists in my head thus far, but one day that'll change.
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=1
Pinkie_Pie, the amazing part is that of all the shippers I have starred in (6 at least so far) you have never appeared outside of a cameo
i've been shipped with Rarity and Rainbow Dash, and I was shipped by Applejack to Rarity in a fanfic inside a fanfic
Im still doomed
(i love this conversation)

So, Val, what do you mean by "Feedback"?
Except he's done that for almost five years
from the title i was kinda expecting scatman
Does that include links to the room?
Swear to god, one day I was browsing Random Articles on Wikipedia and when he began to rant, I ended up at Hitler

2ohai NightCat, I didn't see you log on
Aww
That Luna comic is cute
At least it didn't end with SEND HER TO THE MOON
Valthejean I did. I sent it yesterday im dieing to be a mod.
Poker face.
I sent mine a few days ago. I dont really care about it to much. I can do the responsibilities just fine, but my real reason is for the colours.
So I guess you could say im offering to work for some pink pixels.
XD
Pinkie_Pie, are you me?
Valthejean, will you stream, or just be crowd control?
No Dashite, you are me.
I have 58 minutes to do something meaningful with my evening
Oh, as long as we have that cleared up then.
Suggest me something!

There's been another re-write
2*shivers*
Toning down the crybabiness a bit, redoing Chapter 10 (again), and redoing Chapters 13 and 18 a bit.
How do you fanfic writers keep motivated to keep writing, really?
Passion?
/me pets kitten
Good talk!
2I can't speak for fanfic writers, but I know actual writers just really love writing :P
also guys

WE'RE GETTING UP
Eh
as in
we're in the favorites feed
2wewt!
Val! From the beings who bring the Sea Ponies, I present ye THE SMOOZE! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CnOysetlQw
2what....what the hell am I watching?
SMMOOOOOZE
A sea of Muks
Wow
I-it's okay, f-f-friendship is magic isn't r-related to this
Yfw it is in the next season
:D
So how is little miss kitten? (assuming the gender identifier is correct)
Discord is totally the SMOOZE
2that would be the day that I lose all hope for humanity
2and then proceed to plunge into a mentality of homicide
No, sorry
I don't think the people who're working in the show now want to ruin their careers forever
I'm just having fun.
2 / want an army of pissed off bronies coming to disembowel them
Well
FUN ISN'T ALLOWED
RUIN? THIS WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT ON THE WORK THAT IS FIM
I...
Just gonna
Go
Over there <-
yeeeeah *follows zero*
HA, FOALS. SMOOZE WILL MAKE FIM GREATER THAN EVER IMAGINED AND WHERE WILL YOU BE THEN, EH NEIGH-SAYERS?
Past Sins and Romancing Quest finished?
Buying up the entire stock of pokeballs so I can contain it.
2now let's hope I never have to hear about Nyx again >.,
This must be my anniversary!
Nope, S3 has an overarching storyline about Nyx.
NYX!
(Actually, my anniversary was Wednesday. The day I moved into the res halls)
2the best decision the FiM execs made was to force anyone who worked on the show to NOT read fanfic
Val: THat's a good idea regardless.
yeah otherwise we would see *shivers* Spiserses
No, they're animators, not on crack, weed, LSD, PCP, and Four Loko all at once.
2lol
Although one of them animating Double Rainbow (the clean one) would be hilarious.
2yeah, if the writers would be so easily influence by Spiderses, then FiM would not have been the epic awesomeness that it is
Val
Don't you make me read some Spiderses to you Val!
What is your least favorite pony? Mine is probably.. Well IDK
Although being asked why they don't and responding "But really, it's too hard, and I just don't like it that way" would potentially be better.
I kinda like most of them
2I love all ponies Pinkie_Pie :P
QUICK VAL, PM
Hey does anyone know the order of the movies for next week?
Even sea ponies?
2sea ponies aren't ponies
2they are hippocampus
2and they are abominations
Sea ponies are thalidomide victims, and should be pitied.
Come on Val, there must be ONE pony you hate
I see
Nyx, perhaps?
I suppose so
Yes, the MLP/MLP/MLP/MLP/Transformers crossover
2Nyx isn't real
2fanon does not exist
They dont have to be canon
2so is not included
Oh yah, you hate fanfics don't you?
Anyone else have a least favorite? :0
2with the fiery force of a thousand suns
2but if I had to pick one
2I hate Trixie
Oh, so the people working on the FiM project can't read fanfics?
2mostly because everyone keeps trying to pretend she's misunderstood
2when she's just a bitch
^ you troll you
My least favorite pony is Twist by far, with Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon right behind
FreezeFrame
I read that one
Luna's Excellent Adventure?
RainbowDash is least favorite
ValtheJean I hated Trixie in the show, but in the fics she's awesome :P
2I weyalll impale you RDash O_o
I hate Snips/Snails the most. (They count as one)
So, wow. A trixie seapony would be your bane, eh Val?
Lol
Great and powerful fish.. Thing
/me tries to imagine that
mfw he hates trixie
Trixie is tied for #3 pony
John Cena referencing Raritroll obliquely on Raw.
2I could not murder it fast enough Pinkie_pie
my flankbook account is named Diamond Tiara -.-
#3 pony?
I hate Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon
They're bullies.
And bullies who don't intend to reform need to be set on fire.
2I certainly hope they never return
2they were useful as antagonists...nothing more
Who? Seaponies?
2no, DT and SS
2but yeah, include sea ponies :P
2in the list of not reappearing that is
You speak as if you are not scared.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4TedkQP_hM
Now for everypony's favorite Chicagoite on Raw
CM Punk
Only good thing to come out of Chicago.
Especially since the Bears are from there.

Nobody..
Awww....
So.. Uhm.. Awkward?
/me nudges ValtheJean
You okay?....
/me is confused...
2I am perfectly fine Pinkie_Pie
I'm excited for 3.5 Rainbow Dash in FiM S2 :P
RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE
Is this some inside joke?
(Which will be a mind swap episode, of Rarity's mind in Rainbow's body)
No
Night bros, see yall tomorrow.

Hi Octavia hi Pinkie pie
Hi TwilightSparkle
So val how do like being a mod?
2I feel the appropriate amount of emotions that one should express
14Hi Twilight
hiya!
one of the weirdest mlp fim ytps ive seen http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qomos5A1BFE&feature=related
I still think this one is weirder, despite knowing its origin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHZj8Xp-Ik
that one is just random...
/me is very much a little miss kitten
whoops
there we go.
We streaming anything tonight?
So. Everyone asks for favorite Ponies...
But I am more specific!
Who is everyone's favorite fillies?
I prefer scootz.
Applebloom I guess
Sweetie Bell by far
Fluttershy, Luna, then 3-way-tie between Rarity, twilight, and Trixie
Silverspoon
GLASSES = WAIFU TO BE
Suddenly Razyn
Eeyup~
2ohai razyn
And suddenly val is a mod
mfw ValtheJean has no favorite filly?
That's surprising. Val is the opinion master.
SO MUCH OPINION
I thought Val was the Jean?
scoots
Val is the mod
2and the impaler :P
ValtheJean is a mod now?
2and I dunno Edward, I love all ponies
>You mean implyer
2O_o
dark blue text on black background
not very professional
You mean fanfic reader
I know right.
Everyone has a favorite, Y U NO HAVE FAVORITE?
2sprinkles made me pick it >.<
That monster!
Rarity is my favorite :D
15it was either that or ugly silver
/me squints
What silver?
Silver looks better
Silver. Ugly
2I thought so too, sprinkles didn't :P
/me 0would pick white. Just to troll the other mods.
4Oh so I'm not one my Dari? BRING IT BITCH.
0"Oh, but I have chosen a color!"
Val, why do you have such a hard time picking favorites?
2?
0harsh bro
2My favorite pony is Caramel
2all the others I love equally
0Favorite filly. Nao.
2except trixie
2she can die alone
/me already knows how much you like Caramel
0' ^ '
And I said "Filly"
Lol
0bleh
0Caramel sucks
0cock
0brb
2*sigh* if I had to choose, which as a disclaimer I will say does not mean I dislike the others, Sweetie Belle
0Bye~
2please no more textless spam guys
0Where?
there we go, now I can troll 2 mods at once
0Or is it filtered...?
VAL i USE WHITE.
THE RONYSATA HAS A BLACK BACKGROUND
He is not lying
2ah, my bad
He did use white
OH MY GOD! VAL IS ALREADY LETTING THE POWER GO TO HIS HEAD!
Wel, dan
2the chrome bronystate has a white background
that was wierd
Val
0Highlight my posts if you wanna see what I'm saying.
you lie
2you have my apologies razyn
im on chrome and it is black
Heh
0It's okay val.
2well, it's white for me
well what site are you on
2appreciated razyn
2dinkypage
"Yes, the world really could be ending, and Pinkie Pie would still be Pinkie Pie."
15How about I use grey and get auto-kicked a hundred times a night?
0...Not a kick. Cool.
I have a black background
2well, I'm not sure why it isn't displaying your text for me razyn
Because Razyn is forcing it white
15Wait we can use grey?
Eeyup.
So on your screen, it's coming in white on white
Cause I'm hax
0parently not
I know this because I use teal for my text
I have a "color"
(for display, I mean. No color codes here)
2well, I'd prefer it if you guys didn't do that to make my life easier ;)
0Well, it's easier for me so bleh.
Well, it's easier for me so bleh.
2fair enough razyn
2I'll just make sure to highlight your text
14Nope, cant use grey. Its considered a color and colors are only for mods. :P
14Though the one you're using is so light it looks white to me.
14Almost.
0In this chat: trolling a mod harder than PCIsSuperiorToMACandValIsWrong easy like a boss.
0It was a warning for me. :\
Ah
lol
If I were op, I'd use black on hot pink
Dashite, i must ask. were you serious?
0Maybe he changed it? I don't break rules often, so I don't know how his script works.
No.
Alright
2I dunno razyn
14Could just be not working atm.
11Just to see if scrpit is on
14Nope.jpg
14Lmao
2then maybe that gray really is an exception?
14Its so light maybe its not picking up on it.
0What grey?
2we'll have to let dari know when he gets back
14I'm not sure what parameters it uses.
color 15
0>Octavia's color on my bar
14Its the one a bit lighter than mine.
15I used it not five minutes ago.
0It warns
14Did it warn you for it?
14Then I guess it is picking up on it.
14Should be for anything for simple white.
Octavia's is 14
2maybe the script just derped
14*except for simple white
0What made you think it didn't work?
0Or black
14Thought you werent getting any warnings about it.
/me is making a slow me post
0Eeeew pink
14Comes up red for me. The me posts that is.
2it looks kinda pink to me...but I've got a white background for some reason
2so it could be screwing with my sigbht
2sight*
14Possibly. I've got a black background. Its like a light red for me.
0On black it's a gross exposed flesh pink
I just realized I might get a capture card for my b day!
2very nice
14Thats cool Twilight
Hey ladies.
What's going on?
If I do get one I would LOVE to help stream season 2 got a nice plasma screen tv behind me ^^

0Chat is not very active
looks like another youtuber joins the herd. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdq07a2Cvko&feature=feedf
OH GOD
spy derpy and you win
NO NOT FLUTTERSHY
YOU BASTARDS
FLUTTERSHY NOOO
This makes me sad...
I..
I know the guy that wrote that
2why do so many ponies cause such terrible things to fluttershy?
He was talking about it the other day
But I forgot who it was
XD
Pinkie_Pie is it good?
I dont know about the story
I read the author notes just now
I remember someone talking about writing it
And he said he would torture rainbow dash as well
The author wrote it as his entrance into Grimdark and Sad writing, and it was mostly him enjoying the idea of a demon possessing fluttershy, possibly to explain Flutterrage
and Fluttershy is also his favorite
/me 2hates fanfics with a burning passion
/me knows
we know val. we know
sorry Spyro, I totally forgot :X
/me had been super busy volunteering at the pride society
and now I'm working full time ._.
One of the tricks to making a piece of fiction affect readers, especially for sadness, is to do horrible things to a well-loved character.
Fluttershy is certainly well-loved.
/me wishs she remembered the writer of that fanfic
Uhh.. >.<
2yes, but in the case of fanfics it's just lazy. If they want to have people cry over a character, they need to MAKE them loveable. Just copy-pasting someone who already is loveable is nothing more than cheap
I'm not disagreeing
I, personally, couldn't write a grimdark
Maybe not even a sad
Goddamn my connection some days
I get misty-eyed at the least provocation.
I can't imagine how badly I'd flood the area if I trid to write one.
2lol
/me 2hugs FreezeFrame. There there, it'll be okay
my only fanfic ideas are sad stories, shipping stories, and grimdark-war stories
i be a horny angry person apparently
2mfw the entire chat is idle
Hi

Are you lonely?
its totally not because we've moved into other chatrooms branching off of this...or anything

2awwww
0By Val
I only call men ma'am. don't worry
/me 2hugs mirthtinker my first hug all day!
0Hope you can read this, because I am typing as hard as I can.
2much love to all of you
... I only got to hug Luna. hrmph
2yeah I can see it Razyn :P
2I just have to work for it ;)
shush you SilverMane...you get better goodnight stuffs :P
2O-o
2I'm going to pretend I DIDN'T hear that, and go to sleep untainted
2farewell!
ValtheJean: Romancing Quest has lesbian Fluttershy, straight Dash, and bi, poly Twilight.
indeed i do
really FreezeFrame? Must read... wait, POLY!?!?
poly just... scares me
polyamory
Just with two others.
None of that 7 wives stuff.
you mean, as in multiple partners?
It actually makes sense, Silver
Yes.
0It's a nice touch.
at once.
okay, was confusing it with pansexual
/me has a few poly friends
0Very cute when done right.
holy crap! 63rd rune updated!
today is a good day for fanfics
0I was reading that, then lost it. Then Cross and Arrow came around.
Also, I ripped apart a homophobe's argument with religion
0Profit was had.
k
He claimed homosexuality was unnatural. I told him that with all the gay sex that happens in the animal kingdom, he's saying his own God fucked up.
i dislike polyamory
just can't get into it
It's not for me, but I can see the appeal.
And hey, as long as everyone's of age and not being abused, not my concern what others do in their bedroom.
(And no, BDSM isn't abuse, since it's consensual)
pretty much FreezeFrame. (and I"m a BD person...)
0Polyamory? Isn't it Polygamy?
polygamy is marriage
polyamory is sex
0Oooh yeah...
polyamory is actually about love, not sex
0But you're still a Polygamist either way, right?
kinda like how sexual orientation is about more than just the sex.
try explaining that to people who claim bestiality is about sex
Nope, polygamy is only if you marry them.
/me 0has a head filled with fuck
0And Pedophilia's meaning has been corrupted as well
but animalism doesn't sound that kinky, so...
yeah, supposed to be love for feet. not this child rape shit
0....No
0Wut
actually, that's accurate
twas a joke. Pedo means foot
the prefix ped- means foot
or ped, as it were
0pedo-
means child and feet
0WTF
medical terminology, based in latin
Actually, you're looking for pædo
The æ (ae ligature) being dropped from English was extremely unfortunate.
it was dropped because it's hard enough to teach kids to use our already convoluted language and grammar without combining letters
0Paedophilia, for sake of argument?
0Just, right now?
we know what you mean if you say Pedophile, and if you mean feet, say foot-fetish
0Fine, well.
0Now I forgot where I was going.
lol, another crises averted
Wrek
But yeah, my whole theory on it is, well, if all parties are of age to consent, of solid mind to consent, and do consent, who cares what kinda freaky stuff you do?
0Amen, brudda
pretty much. I only care if cheating is involved
0...but I am quite lustful, so i may be biased.
And yes, they are involved, even if not directly.
i personally only want one partner at a time, and i do not plan on sharing at all until we are through
FreezeFrame, good way to view it.
0FreezeFrame is now pretty cool in my book.
http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkohdmCLjd1qfl6kxo5_500.png
0Daw
lol dat Fallweather Friends
0But still, thanks for spoiling the poly Twilight for me. I was looking forward to *squeeing* at that.
fortunately i'll forget by the time i get around to it
have you read 'Out in the Cold'?
0I'm almost right there.
0Yes.
Sorry, figured you'd been working through it, and it's pretty obvious before it's made explicit.
0Except for the last bonus chapter
READ BONUS CHAPTER
0I will!
it is hilarious, sets up all sequels, and has BEST oc in the entire fandom
0I know it's obvious. I just *really* hate spoilers.

0It's in my queue, mate! I just got the internet back at ten!
sometimes the obvious is predicted early, and is stolen from us at the last moment, making it shocking
0^
...eeyup, website in the topic still down
for instance, 'Of Mares and Magic', I predicted the end of the story (12 chapters long) in chapter 4
anyway, I really need to sleep.
Also, I hope Merely a Mare does finish.
and the reason i predicted it, was because it was the only way the author could make it a legit story with real emotional considerations
0Author: Problem, Silvermane?
not at all. I LOVED that he was brave enough to do it
i expected him to cop-out at the end and make it a lovey-dovey let's fuck ending, rather than teh brutal, real life sacrificial ending it was
but then the epilogue...
but it reinforced Twixie shipping in general. I'm out too. night everypony
/me 0loved the epilogue
/me 0is out
I'm not a fan of Twixie, but I think that relationship works better as sisters.
0Did you hear about Roxie?
but sleep
9:30 class
In the building furthest from my res hall
(Though I'm not in the furthest res hall)
0I have school too. On Wednesday.
0I AM OUT
chat so dead

Hey everypony
Hey.
How is every one?
Is this channel still looking for mods?
Well I've just been away for about 4 days, and God do things travel fast, so I'm not sure, but if nothing has changed, we should still be looking for mods.
Hey DecapPony.

Best line ever: "Also, Seth, you need to watch WWE. It's like a soap opera, except the acting's mostly terrible and everyone's trying to kill each other. It's pretty much the greatest thing ever. "

http://miburl.com/XmjaAd
and spamming chat with pwnie pics
is Deus EX HR worth getting?
Ohai everypony
Hey.
Hey RobotPinkie
How's things?
hai people
DecapMan: ABSO-EFFING-LUTLEY
I'd say
I'm good thanks, and yourself?
Bit hectic, minor test tomorrow. Otherwise I'm fairly pony.
i have school in 2 days :(
wreck is it like open world or rail storyline?
5open world
5you decide when to leave for "main quest" missions
5the city nexus if large and have tons of side quests and shops and shit
5the multiple ways to approach the main missions are awesome
5non-lethal to fucking blowing shit upo
5i <3 it
new Deus Ex or what?
EXPLOSION
5RobotPinkie: aye
ohai Pegacorn
5heck you can even finish missions "ghosting"
Really looking forward to playing the new Deus Ex, but it's gonna have to wait
5which basically is complete a mission without beeing seen by anyone, not guards, not cameras
5never triggering alarms and traps
5etc
5the difficulty is realistic
Sounds like my kinda play style
5 1 shot to the head and you die
5and it works the other way around
5the ai is acutally smart
so is it as hard as the first Splinter Cell?
Implying that AI can be smart.
5Pegacorn: will less dumb do?
5sigh
>implying AI can't be clever
:P
5RobotPinkie: hard and hard, you can make it hard
5going ghost and non-lethal on hardest diff
Kasparov wants a word with you, Pegacorn :P
5and yes it will be very hard
Well, ghost an non-lethal on normal, is that hard?
Kasparov?
5going ghost anywhere is hard
5which is the point of playing like that
5did this fun thing today where i tapped a guy on the shoulder then hit him in the face knocking him oute
5thats the nonolethal option
Garry Kasparov, former world chess champion, Pegacorn
5the lethal would be breakign his neck and stabbing him in the heart
Orite
lol that does sound like fun, Wrek
I tend to like the non-lethal option, it usually makes things harder.
5using a sniåper i took this guy out
5but i missjudged and he was visible by 1/10 guards
5so they all pulled out their guns
5sounded the alarm and started searching the whole area
5i was up on a balcony taking them out 1 by 1
Oh cool, so they don't have psychic powers and know where you are right away
5untill 2 sneaked up on me and 3 saw me on the balcony
5so that attempt i got HS'd back
5but then i prepped with a mine in the stair
5and stood at another position
5though that time no one saw the dead ones
Sounds tricky, yeah.
try playing through new vegas on hard in hardcore
NEW VEGAS FTW
Oh I will, DecapMan... as soon as they release a game of the year edition :P
5DecapMan: i have beat all endings on hardcore on hardest diff without the crossair
/me is a cheap bastard
5it was awesome
5in NV
i did it without vats, crosshair with a unarmed spec
including all currently out DLCs
cant wait for the divide DLC!
5weirld wild west and light frame, with focus on survival and medicine
5never use vats anyway
Oh yeah? I did it without even having the game. Naked. While doing a hand stand on the top of a flag pole.
i just stealthed
5pro-gamer-brohoof DecapMan
i also beat saints row 2 without using weapons except in railshooter missions
5never played saints
5though i remember playing through doom 3 on nightmare when that was recently released
5something ill never do again
i would of been too freaked out to do that
i was 8 when doom 3 came out
ON TOP OF A FLAG POLE
Yup. True story.
so i got a machete
3-heart challenge is a fun thing to do for any Zelda fans out there. I highly recommend it.
doesn't work in all Zelda games, for obvious reasons...
i just put nitrous on a bulldozer :D
ON TOP OF A FLAG POLE
i got pancakes
I got Dr Pepper.
FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
I got Dr Pepper JELLY BEANS.Beat that.
brb
I have... uh... ponies?
Damn.
i have a pony mohawk
i have a blunt
I have... tea.
I'm back
i have iced tea
I have... tons of pages to go through before tomorrow's test...
That must suck.
It's repetition, so hopefully more of it sticks... but yeah, kinda sucks after a couple of hours.
Gonna play some GMod,seeya all later.
later Pegacorn
I have Chimaira's new album
and like 8 chapters of APUS history homework to do by tommorow

Wut
HAI 2001 SPACE ODDESY PONY REFERENCE!
HAI BRITISH ACCENTED VOICE!
I have that bookmarked
Because its just that awesome
But then again, I bookmark everything I like
Hm
Let them hear this
Play that episode where House makes fun of his coworkers and miraculously discovers the cure
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCzXqZMbATA&feature=related
Hey man
I know, I know
But that house reference is funny as balls
I don't really know anything about TV, I haven't watched much of it for 8-9 years
Lol
XD
Its more annoying than the original
Yeah, his voice is clearly not as sexy as Rarity
its cause its a colt version
I wouldnt say that
deadpool watching the ponies is funny
That hurt my ears so much...
Lol
can we see the latest episode of nerouticly yours?
NNNNOOOOO
XD
actually, isnt that bad
The guy who made these actually voices all the characters
ok it got kind of worse
Its not perfect, but its actually pretty good
Applebuck season intro is probably the best done one
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69MpoVyj-b0
PMV, just not lipsynced
yeah its long, but i could of put in the one of "A Little Piece of Heaven"
Hmm, A7x, nice.
there arent that many A7x PMVs sadly
CoB PMV
Fund it.
:P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueG7PX2PSS0
this one is pretty good too
"Run to the Hills" by Iron Maiden PMV
Allis, Raritys voice sounds pretty sexy in this. XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzoAY2FyFCA&feature=related
Lol, that was lip synced at the end.
takes me back to GTA 4
That song plays on GTA4?
yeah, but it comes with the DLC i think
Lol no thanks Pinky
Pinkie...
the fuck is wrong with my spelling today
everything
/me wishes he knew about video editing software
Lol, what would you make?
Dat Iris wipe
MOARE METAL PMVS!
This is the last one I will make you guys listen to
Yes, Fluttershy and applejack are off.
Applejack*
but isnt this by one guy?
Yes
Thats Rarity
Lol
still impressive
I really don't see how this is good, but to each his own, I guess.
Its good because one person sung it all by himself
The male Dash voice needs to be about 20% cooler.
And did a decent job on it.
I know, its not perfect
Dari is just jealous he wasn't given the role
Lol no, I can't sing.
You guys know that. ;P
i can sing apparently kind of well
Anyway, these are the manliest voices ever.
XD
I could sing, once upon a time, but I'm 10 years out of practise
I can sing instrumental songs only
i havent sung since i was in 5th grade
I havent sung ever, I dont want to
XD

New EQD Post: It's Official. Tenant Had Been Voted Worst Doctor of All Time.
:P
Oh gawd. I have never bothered to watch this
And now I will have to
XD
GAH, I dislike these
who is tenant?
It just did
House is best doctor
i just put it on there to troll
XD
Tennant is best Doctor.
Tennant is best Doctor
who is tennant?
/me doesnt even know who Tenant is
He acted as the Doctor once.
>who is Tenant
>mfw
Note the capitalisation :P
Tennant is the best doctor, Doctor.
Etc.
im lazy, and i failed english
:P
i think Dr-Luna is the best doctor
NOWAI
Hmmm, I can agree to that...
Dash looks are darker shade of blue here than normal
a
this was all done by 1 guy
also i love crazy pinkie pie
I downloaded the whole MLP season in 720p MKV h.264
and slut rarity
And it still has some pixelation on the Pinkies hair and Dashs tail
Honestly, I agree with his portrayal of dash
everything is kinda oversaturated in this video
Dash's hide looks the most saturated
idk what saturated means
The audio or video Robotpinkie?
video
Um, video. I'm not sure how oversaturated audio would look. :P

We have "Artists" writing something
2"Welcome Princess Celest"
That would crush his soul
But, we have no way to make him read it.
7Would you be willing to read it while streaming?
LOL SPIKE
Spike's voice is so awesome in these...
Can't tell if serious or trolling
He'll just leave if I start reading it.
7You don't know that
He will be curled up on the floor twitching
Paralyzed with fear
Me? I'm kidding about Spike. I'd hardly call it trolling.
Yeah I do, he left when I read Friendship is Sexy for the viewers.
Or some other clopfic.
You read FIS...
Lol
7Tell him it's a present for becoming a mod
I read part 1.
Never read part 2.
I only read this stuff out of request.
I dont think there is a part 2, is there?
The fic was posted as one post, but was split up within itself.
ohai Flutterposey
It's Megan and Applejack
Ok, I can't watch any more of this.
This be funny
7Try to keep him listening as long as possible
2lol bless your mercy dari
2bless your mercy
You lack in stamina, young dari
2on a side note
2the VA for spike sounded like Buster from Tiny Toons
If I say it's a challenge, Val will ban me forever, so no.
NEVER GIVE UP. NEVER SURRENDER
2Y so much hate for Val? :(
We are also going to try to get it on EQD
And then his very being will be shattered
Meh, I'll do it if I get something ready for him afterwards that he'll like.
Or he'll hate me.
FOOOOOOOOREEEEEEEEEVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER
lol you know why wub woo, Val :P
2:D
Sorry to come berging in like this.. OMG what are you guys watching?? :p Anyways.. Is Ponychan down or something?
/me 2feels so wubbed
Barging*
2lol hello Grandil. And yeah, it's looking like ponychan is down
7Also, Dari does one have to be an owner to give AOP?
Weird, I was just in /merch/ 10 minutes ago
Ah ok.. That's wonderful.. Guess I should go do something useful then..
I dunno, try giving someone AOP without being owner, you'll find out.
:P
down now... they need to get that sorted...
@check ponychan.net
But anyways.. To avoid the "useful" stuff.. Are you watching G1? :)
7Can Pinkie give me owner?
Haha Ok :)
@check ponychan.net
6ponychan.net is down.
I haven't seen any of the episodes myself.

He's had her plenty of times...
You can't +q people with mode.
2and he screencapped it for all to see :P
but only in his fantasies
mew
Also if you just give it without adding to the access list it won't be permenant.
2of course, THIS is my favorite screencap

True, that guy on House loved it...
So, there can be more than one owner?
7THere is right now
2I honestly am not sure
just erotic asphyxiation?
Just to get this straight, who's streaming?
7not me
oh, alright
auto means you do it to yourself
When's the fic gunna be finished anyway?
Spyro the dragon?
=o
7Whenever Silvermane and Mirthtinker finish it
Is there a reason you're talking about asphyxiation? lol
There was a reverend not too long ago in the US who was found in his closet...
2so how about dem ponies?
Pinkie_Pie: Eeyup, Spyro the dragon.
I love Spyro
With... uh... something inserted into his rear end, and a rope around his neck
Not as much as I used to, but I still do
Apokalipse: You just missed this
[16:00] <ValtheJean> O_o
[16:00] <RobotPinkie> Hot
[16:00] <ValtheJean> well, you're bound to sweat when I strangle you to death
That's why.
Also, how do I unban Val?
Why am I not surprised? lol

2oh yeah
2I downloaded the first game
2just so I could keep killing him
DRR DRR DRR

Thats dedication.
2because he deserves to die alone

I hope I left you with a lovely mental image.
Trololo.
>yfw when I asked Dari to play that
2must...resist....flame bait....

Y U WANT PERMA OWNER?
What are you plotting.
>.>
7Nothing honestly
I'm flattered, she's just not my spieces
Original owner supercedes new owners anyway.
7I noticed
7I can't set +F
So, he couldnt delete the channel or ban me?
Lol
Well he can ban you.
But you can unban yourself.
And remove his owner.
7Why would I ban you?
As for deleting the channel, I'm not sure.
7Or delete the channel?
2lol, isn't this video your most played/viewed dari?
I have learned since last night that it is good to be paranoid
I dunno. XD
Val might be on to us because of Dashite
7Also, can I set the channel back to +i now?
mine is seaponies
7You banned him
really?
Im pretty sure he can still enter
He just cant talk
2you know you like it dark_heart :P
There are no bans on this channel.
Rainbow Dash version is best version
7I see
Nothing to stop anyone from talking either.
Video name?
yes, because I use it to troll people by making it autoplay. Thing is it autoplays for me too
XD
true
7We stopped Dashite from talking yesterday

Only the bestest friend ever
yay killing scores of mythical beasts
You brought up dat picture?

Ponies..
YOU WANT PONIES?
coooooool. except for dragons. dont go killin dragons. i like dragons
why arent we watching ponies?
got to go, brb in a bit
I want ponies
*nobs*
Watch it with that, the kissing is borderline for our rules.
2Justice League got terrible when they decided to add in 400000000 heroes

Don't post more like that please.
What's this about GGgala?

{1,0You0,4Tube}: "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic - Episode 6: Boast Busters Captioned" - "A new unicorn has arrived in Ponyville, and she claims to wield the strongest magic in Equestria."
Let's watch that
I made sure to pick your favorite episode Val
No pony eps outside BMN
Ok
2I never said I hated the episode
2I just hate Trixie
yeah
But she is GREAT and POWERFUL
let's watch CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS /loud
GGgala has been drafted to streaming staff position effective last night
CCC
Trixie does suck.
Ah okay, cool
errr CMC
Good.
Yay, can't wait to watch S2 here
CMC works.
We got any backup streamers?
zomg can't wait
that means you and I have to start organizing the Infrastructure, Dari
theres an infrastructure here?
dari: Percy-Vee is a very promising candidate and we'll be testing his capacity soon. RDash's PC couldn't handle it. No word from Kevlar yet
what will the quality be like here for season 2
pretty much like the movies when streamed by me.
So pretty much the same as SD quality
is K
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-argument-is-invalid.jpg
maybe a bit better and almost DVDrip
we'll see
My computer could probably stream, but I dont know about my upload speed
nice
I can't afford digital this year, so I can't volunteer
Only 0.5mbps
Pinkie_Pie http://speedtest.net
my upload is enough
Last time I checked
oh
my upload is only 1mbps
I'd totally stream S2. Only a couple of problems. My computer is terrible, I'm too lazy, I won't have the time, I can't really be bothered.... oh yeah and I don't get the hub... apart from that I'm a great candidate
and i'm in australia
RobotPinkie was in here wasnt he?
Decap: do you have the Hub?
Probably?
yeah
RobotPinkie
Your invitation has been sent.
can i get an invitation?
My upload is 0.35 mbps. lol
Can you be trusted, DecapPony?
eeeyup
But there's a lot going on in here, already, isn't there?
Decap: can I get info on your CPU and RAM?
additionally, do you have a capture card? If not, are you willing to spend 15 bucks?
we want to have three S2 streamers at least
RobotPinkie
Were you in here yesterday?
we got one plus a promising candidate
so yeah, we still have a slot open
For a short bit
capture cards are only $15?
You.. Know what we are doing?
Or no?
i dont
Does ponychan not work for anyone else?
where do you get these mythical cheap capture cards
You arent supposed to know yet Decap
Wish I were in the US, then I could stream...
fair enough
ponychan doesn't seem to be loading for me either
I don't know, no
It works on my end.
Hm
DecapPony: not the fancy ones...but easyCap does the job very well for its price
ponychan is so strange most of the time
PM it to him if ou dont want me to know
We cannot allow you tell Val about anything we do in here.
By that I mean it won't work! D:<
I've witnessed first time
I dunno if you ever went to KevlarMoses's stream back in S1
nope
2hmmm....stream seems to be derping for me today
Why? I'm confused...
splat
but i might be able to just stream if i can get a USB to USB cable
Stream is fine for me. Too bad I'm not watching
Val the Arch Demon
are you doing Caramac shipping? :P
Original Justice League was better
A tyrant, if there ever was one
Close enough, but no.
2^
Far worse, actually
Poor Val.
but I taught him to use Livestream and had him get easycap
The quality was good and I watched almost-fullscreen at 1280 width-ish
Everyone's always trolling him. XD
Also keep in mind this was Livestream, who has quality restrictions up the ass
Yeah stream's fine here too, today, with the exception of getting disconnected from it once
I LOVED the original, but didn't like unlimited
haha
oh, well is it external?
the quality was comparable to Pensivepony's ep uploads in LS
Should be a lot better here
Prince, the difference is the amount of work we are doing to troll him
Hours of work
From several people
Including 3 fic writers
Man, I'd volunteer to stream, but with my schedule it's very unlinely.
Wow...
5 if you count their alter egos
yeah, it's an USB dongle. You connect your TV's analog out to RCA cables, connect the cables to your easycap, and then Easycap to PC Via USB
Alrightttt
don't these fellows see their arrows and revolvers are not enough
brb
gonna go to class <3
We also hope to get what we make on EQD
I'll be on my phone mebe
lol
We will need to get Cereal Velocity to post it
As I doudt sethisto will.
it's the most affordable option
It's 8.76 without shipping on Amazon
+ 1.69 for 12 ft RCA cables
Ya dun goofed
i would probally go and check the local computer store first so i wouldnt have to get my mom to buy it for me
Prince, your PMs
IM going to show you what I normally wouldnt
they're hard to get that way, but please do so
I should get easyCAP. Shame the only close online store selling it here wants 20€ lol
Give me a minute.
dari
?
can I ask you a favor?
Sure.
Are we watching someone playing Dragon's Lair now?
I have no idea what we're watching.
we trolling Val with some type of shipping fic?
It's the less good than the original justic league
http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/1472/191770-dirk_large.gif
Looks like Dirk the Daring, to me :P

supah powahs
Not with link to fic.
okay Dari
Make a testing Veemi channel and send DecapPony the FMS URL/Streamname/FME/VHScrCap/ect.
Ok.
7im waiting for my dancing song...
Sorry Sathi, it's just 1 minute more.
/me 7did put her dancing socks on
wait what am i doing?
Well, I'm not really a writer, so...
test having him stream a bit. Quality optimization is not important at this phase. Have them keep an eye on CPU usage. Report the results back to me. If everything is peachy, he'd be drafted into streaming service
I've not met any dragons yet
what do i need?
That's a nic ending
mostly maeads, satyrs, centaurs, gorgons, nasty things like that
dragons are awesomeness

Who, me? I love it now, but when I first read it, not so much...
2dat fluttershy creeps me out
wish I had a size reference for those ponies
/me hasn't read Cupcakes
not because I'm scared of it
/me 7won't read it
Cupcakes is worth it for the puns.
it's more like "I don't give a fuck"
IMO
You should, it's a psycological thriller
this isn't as good as the cartoon
So damn punny.
A rollercoaster of emotions
Has anyone here read Severing?
Cupcakes makes this name 20% funner
I read all of Severing
I actually have had more fun reading those "Ask Pinkamina comics".
never read reconnection though
Applesmack?
You'll go from happy, to sad, to joyful, to euphoric, to content
or the Epilogue
She's a crackhead?
Did you like it?
just till Twi vs. Flutts
"Reconnection" ?
I read it and reconnection
Is this canon?
Reconnection is the unofficial sequel
RobotPinkie Of course
It's pretty good and a tad bit less grim
Rainbow Dash hurting her wings is Canon
Because cardboard and duct tape
Jesus those bloated costume ponies freak me out...
I like duct tape, it lets me stick myself to myself while sticking myself to the wall
SONG
WUT
Is this like that video in The Ring?
That's PINKIE'S SONG
WHAT THE HELL TWILIGHT
NOOOOOOO
....what the hellllll

Pinkie's song without Pinkie, GENIUS
ET TU DASH?
FAOKSDFPAKSDGOASGKPAOPGKSAKOPDFGKOPAERga
Twilight is like "Problem, Pinkie?"
...
2lol, seeing dari's reaction was totally worth the loss of brain cells
LOL
Screw this stream. All it ever brings is rage and pain!
THEY STOLE MY SONG!
What abomination is this
hahhaahaa I love how people here hate it
And how people over at the other IRC hated it when people bashed it
2lol wut?
I like it
It's not TERRIBLE
just bad
It's pretty darn terrible
Except that this is directed at kids
what other IRC?
2I think a guy on ponychan said it best
If this is not the definition of terrible I would like to see what is..
because only kids are there
2this was definitely meant for kids
2and sure, it's abhorrent to us
2but hey, it's a decent kids show
I guess Grats are in order for Val
meant for kids. Where have I heard that before?
I agree with Val
2why ty sumica
even though he has worst color
/me 2cries
yeah
2it's not my fault!
use black
7*soothes*
#mylittlepony at another server
They just wanted to remind people this is a kids show and hating stuff that's related to the show but more for kids is stupid, though
Well, I don't mind this existing, I just... don't want to watch it...
Well if you get mIRC Val.
mobileDCD are you the/that "DCD"?
You could have a background colour on your colour.
So it's readable.
:P
No, he's his evil twin
2I actually do have it dari, and I've been meaning to ask you about it
noooooo
7hahaha
wasn't one video enough?
7there's even more
yeah. This is just me on my cell phone's IRC Client
Oh, ok... It's hard to tell without the whole colour thing-y
I am New DCD
/me refuses to put on headphones
LAUGH OUT LOUD
WUT
NO
NOT AGAIN
NO
NOOOOOOOOOOO
HOW COULD YOU?!?!?!?!?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
That's me laughing out loud
PLZ DR-LUNA HALP!!!!
2this makes me so sad
I AM DYINS
again? why?
2this was the song that made me realize I was a brony :(
What did I do to deserve this?
2and htey have murdered it
d..did they eat pinkie to gain her powers?
7Dari should totally stream this during our mane show...
We truly live in dark times...
I realised I was a brony when I watched about 10 episodes in one sitting
I bet that was a hard part to learn
Lol Dr-Luna. XD
I realized I was a Brony around ep 10.
2dear god! Troll Sathi and Troll Dari....there is no force on earth that can stop them!

I need to read the new chapters of the night that never ended
and re read the earlier ones
So is it going to die forever?
I was sure that I am Brony when I spent entire day attempting to find blind bag ponies.
Ponychan seems to work fine for me, but I have never really bothered doing anything on it..
Yes, this blows...
or bloooooooooooooows if you wish
2lol apokalipse
And now being Brony is kinda my second nature... Which is why it hurts watching this.
nooo dont zoom in
Is it worth doing anything on Ponychan?
Going to use ponychan's IP instead in the future...
You know, I used to like this song and associate it with happyness
but no...
7you have a new association now
7:)
Watching the muted stream does not help at all!
So much hate
What? Nothing could ruin FiM for me.
NOTHING
2NO
2BAD DARI
Not even if season two raped everything we love in season 1?
can we watch spider's web?
Keep playing thid
this
Meh, I can't stream films.
One of our mod rules.
aww, it was so fun...
I restreamed Spider's Web once anyway
Don't know if you were there. XD
What about mini-series, dari?
Why would you do that? xD
I can stream anything other than pony episodes and films pretty much
Cool.
Apokalipse: Because I wasn't there for the movie night when Spider's Web was streamed and I wanted to see it.
You know if Hipster or Ghosties were here now I bet i'd get kicked for mentioning that... film
I was not disappointed, I love it.
7WAT!
But it was awful...
You know it's kinda sad when these things are more show accurate then the toy lines.
Someone should sometimes stream The IT Crowd tv series, it's awesome.
I SEE DEAD CHICKENS
7hmm
7a sec
Awesome film. XD
2hah, I love the IT crowd
The biggest disappointment here is that they didn't even include best pony
2but Black Books is better :P
RobotPinkie Spitfire?
Are they going to deprive children of best pony? That's so mean.
Oh guys, how was the lord of the rings special?
The songs make very little sense when people sing the wrong parts, though....
/me 7just found four seasons of the IT Crowd
2Black Books is better :P
/me meows at Dr-Luna
This guy can take all of my money

sounds like they changed context a bit
/me 7mwows back softly

Black Books, haven't heard about that one. Is it any good?
2it
I wonder how the pinkie part will go...
2is
Don't know if I'd play that
2BRILLIANT
Why wouldnt you?
It has Bill Bailey? Awesome!
I certainly would, I have been very bored lately
hmmm, not the biggest fan of games like that
I prefer real time stuff
besides D&D, but that's an exception
come on video, end already
yfw the rewards will never come
Ohai Val.
EVER
ohai dari
Bill Bailey was also in Spaced.

A rather sinister act of trolling
I didn't catch all of that...
One that will crush his soul
NNNNOOOOO
dari you sould feel bad
you wish to crush valthejea'ns soul?
NO
Please dont

You see, we believe that Val the Arch Demon is a tyrant
Yes, indeed.

gah! Dari! How do I use this acursed client?
Lolz
Yes, Indeed
hey what happend to the one pony, she's on two legs =p
Well, at least he's playing it without sound
If my name would ever come up in lottery picking MLP eps, I'd prolly pick non FIM one.
You sent me a DCC request Val.
I thought that was the PM system >.<
we can hear you faping
You dont value this idea, do you?
it isn't him fapping, it's him clopping

RobotPinkie: i heard I missed our video
We havent told you anything.. Confidental yet, if you would wish, you may leave. Unharmed
Oh yeah
How do you plan to troll valthejean?
It's gotten quite a few views now
We cant just tell you that right off the bat.
We have worked vigorously to keep it a secret
what is that infernal noise dari?
What's that?

how's your Fluttershy styling going, btw, Daz?

13So, Prince
13You used MIRC to do that?
13Because if you did, does that mean a nickname registered on here is registered on MIRC as well?
So, um...
RobotPinkie, the clips are in, so i guess i got SOMETHING done last night. had to go out, and am now at someoneelse's house with their like 500KBps speed. D:
The nick is registered with the network.
Not the IRC client.
So yeah.
registered on mirc? bro, mirc clients just access this
like 'if it's registered in google chrome is it also registered in firefox?'
Ah okay
(good comparison is good :P)
13So, I have this nickname registered
13Does that mean it will work in MIRC to?
Yes.
So is everyone away or something?
13What if it is a different channel other than Bronystate?
howdy
'if i have a facebook account, will it work in google chrome as well?'
Everyone is waiting someone to say/do something... I guess.
well WE WANT IT AGAIN
oh come onnn
I wasn't there ever :(
You register nicks with the network.
Channels are irrelevant.
I'm semi-busy, so my reactions here will be mostly kinda slow...
13Daz
Anywhere on this network, the nick is registered.
13Pretty soon it will
13XD
13Google wants to take over Facebook to im sure
13But what is the "Network"?
13Epic chats?
I should be busy, but am kinda lazy.
This network is epic-chat.
That's why you have to do it EVERY night :P

I was probably in denmark or something...
It would be interesting
well ponychan is back for me now
13I see
Meteor
13Meteor, just for relevance
13You were in here yesterday, right?
13Helping us do what we do best..
Dari...
FYI am not getting sound from the show.
that is the creepiest archer I've ever seen
I hate you right now
13MeteorVenture, its me. From yesterday? We tried to stream ponies and failed so many times
Oh, better.
13But I need to know if you were in here at any point yesterday
why would you do this?
13Because my memory is foggy with names right now
I think I'm going to need some mind soap
I like my MLP with humans.
Lickety-Split is best pony
I like my MLP with a side of FiM

Love British humor :)

It's a clip from "Bottom"
An old british sitcom thingy.

Hey, ValtheJean?
yessums?
What colour do you want the script to do?
bold?
bold
nice
for the background? I dunno...I guess maybe white or something to make it easier on people's eyes
What background, what foreground?
hey dari
?
any progress?
Terribly sorry about that Val, it had to be done
Yeah, got everything set up, but for some reason the config refused to work for VHScrCap
hey daz.. music time?
well I would assume foreground would be the same color I've been assigned
and mfw I have no idea what you're talking about Pinkie_pie
It wouldn't set the "resize to output size" properly, even when he ticked/unticked it.
He couldn't just select a region.
Oh, thats quite alright Val
MeteorVenture, soz man i can't here. I said in bronystate, i'm at a friend's house, and they have like 500KBps interwebs : /. Tonight if you're on maybe
so dari, that means a streaming test was done?
hmm
Well, I couldn't really see anything.
ah.. ahhh so you're Dman too?
tell him to uncheck everything on the capture tab first
yea, just testing something out :P
Because tiny window due to "Resize to output size" no working properly.
and then
not*
alright lol
don't use that option
seriously don't
12,15 Testing
You need it ticked.
well i'm not sure what you mean by tonight but i will have to log off eventually.. usually it's around 5 hours from now
Or you can't select the capture region.
send him the image with the VHScrCap config I have in the streaming guide
But it's not working.
...nice, i have Dari's colour schene =D
use those
Nope
ah ok then MeteorVenture, well next time then

13So, Rainbrodash
dari le skype
13Give me your opinion on Valthejean
10yus?
10.. in what sense?
so I would say background may as well be white to make it simple, with the text being that blue color sprinkles wanted me to use
13Hm
13What.. Do you think of him as a mod?
13As a person?
10mfw practically the same colours as dari? :P
13As a leader?...
well I can pick something else if you'd prefer
ValtheJean: No offence man, but in 10 minutes i have downloaded Mirc, having never even heard of scripts or clients, and can use colours now
10Any particular reason for the question? xD
He can use colours.
But he'd have to do it manually.
2 I can use colors daz
For EVERY message.
this show is so amazing
13No
2 he's just writing me a script
ValtheJean: orly nao
13No reason to your concern, at least.
13Yet.

10and dman I believe he was responding to "<Pinkie_Pie>: > Bronystate rules dont apply in this room, it is its own channel <Pinkie_Pie>: The admins cant save you here if you jeopardize our operations"
this one or #BronyStateModerators?
