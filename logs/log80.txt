I'll take em anyway
I need a name for the TF2 gernade launcher.
Just a discussion about emoticons
6lol
12^
Also Aurora, you want logs of the meeting?
Salad Sandwich and Sketchy Sounds. =p
They're not starships actually
and their true meaning
That'll work
6suuuuuure why not
There's no true meaning
not what these people say they mean
sec
http://pastebay.com/134855
They're actual victorian cruisers
Steamships
Emphimere Aweryn, Dyrene Xith, Quillant De Rawst
"This is the good ship Salad Sandwich!"
It's quite long
03that's what she said
I was thinking of the Mist powered Ships in FF12
Psyentific, Cerulean ...something!
12I don't care what there true meaning is. That would be like saying that if I do something IRL, it has a "true meaning"
...Cerulean Glare?
That'll work
I made weird names for characters.
04Roaraaaaaaaaaaaaa
This netbook screen is tiny
THe thing I was doing was that Every main character would have an A in their last name.
True meaning is a matter of perspective
I think it's kinda tough not to; no one wants to name their character Bobby
Ooo! Locke, you got me two more ideas
Everything is
12^
Demosthenes and Locke
Opinions depend on your philosophies
./Speaker for the Dead reference
Varsanant, Thair, Rawst, Kisaragi, Aweryn

And what you believe in depends on your opinions :p
…lolwut?
he's at Bronyshow
Why not just say Ender's Game?
12So try to stop acting like drf with that face thing
and your philosophies are based off what you believe in
hello DJ
It was in there too
I forgot to put an A in Dyrene's last name though.
Oh right derp
"true meaning" do you mean, the meaning that most people have ?
Dyrane?
Was, I think he jsut left.
yes
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
just*
Yes
But I think Speaker was the better book.
Thank you!!
/me glomps Sketchy_Sounds
and meanings are in people, not words
what is accepted by 99% of net users
Dyrene is her first name.
Well, how do you know what people think?
…oh
Xith was her last name
You don't know their exact thoughts
Xath?
Axith?
Meh
Axith works actualy
Xitha?
^.^
then we can get into a long discussion about samplespaces & biases when sampling, stratas, etc

I might stream some Doctor Who.

I usually want to know meanings of things
I'm getting ship names for Victoria 2
I'd play a bit if it wasn't so late and I wasn't in bed
But it wasn't really a magic school it was a school for all types of adventures. Ranging from Alchemist to Knight to Summoner.

leverage is a bit forced
ok now I have that stuck in my head
/me hugs May :p
yeah
lolwut?
I guess I read fanfiction more than books is becuase they are about characters I'm familiar with and They arn't afraid to explore.
might be a bit botched but those are lyrics from Rapurasu Ni Notte
SilverMane, I don't get it, sorry xD
I think it was >3000 leverages said in 2 or so days.
eh, it's survived better than the ...sir meme did

The word Leverage is said. like. A TON of times in it.

Prison, Leverage was a phrase we started spamming while watching battlefield: earth due to how often they say leverage
Bai :P

/me casts Silence on Loopelly
and we had a meow-spamming advertisement come on during inception last firday
In order to keep from paying a human for work, turned Locke into a horse and had him rape the human.
so now we spam MEOW when we get bored
Should I start with series 1 episode 1 of Doctor Who (Eccelston)?
then, we created a meme of it and made some ponychan threads

Oh xD I see
Something about they wouldn't have to pay if the work was late.

you might not know it by the way I act toward the TV show now that there was a time when I was always out of bed by 9 AM to watch the newest episode
She's Derpy
Derpy would eat the dice 25% of the time
she doesn't play dice
Of course, Amy is a fiery redheaded Scotswoman
What about Rose, FF?
hey Dave_Brozilla
Wilson's dead.
Derpy is and ecelent chemist however.

This is episode 1.

Oh sweet
So I won't be lost

How is it that I've been with the fandom since April and I have only seen the show once? I feel pathetic.
Prison left.

Might be the episode itself you downloaded
we'll always treasure the time we had with Prison
She messed up her eyes using chemichles and her dad got so sick of looking at it he sent her to Amareica to study Chemistry.
YouTube is your friend
So how come prison came here?
AHH

Wilson's dead.
Y U CUT OUT ON ME
I knew it.
probably because we talked aboutit a lot last night
i even got him to say Bronystate once or twice while he was reading my posts
So are the numerous other videos to distract me. I have so many friends.
I'm kicking myself right now.
DCD, Prison came on here. O_o
9great quality, dari
My sister actually had derpy's condition. Totally fixable with modern medicine
ohai NewDCD again
Sup NewDCD
How's your singing career?
We should get Prison to come and talk on here some time, I bet that'd get lots of viewers.
and hey DCD
pics?
lol I loved this doctor
9just that we gotta improve the audio a bit
Though I suppose there could be quite a few things that cause it
9what did Prison say?
Yeah, no idea what to do about the audio.
9and why was he here so short I missed him?
Trixie on the other hand. I made up the idea that Trixie was actually an Amareican imigrant (one of the very few) and she had knowledge in enginering vehichles and such
just came by to check us out, talk, we told him thanks etc

o-o
12they'll just type in all the options one after another
Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ
03LOL
12until they get it right XD
Most of the characters have no backstory. The ones that do only have a small amount that you can fill with pretty much anything you want.
03well
03make it s oif they get it wrong it kicks them for 20 minutes
03or something
Thats part of what makes a MLP story alot easier when you need somepony to have a skill.
12then they come back 20 minutes later get it right by pure luck and are like "hey guys look over they're
And there be your first request
12"
Derpy's canon backstory, she messed up the bird part of WInder Wrap Up and she has some interrest in fashion
Fanfiction paradise
03LOL
OH SNAP
BEEP

Anyone asking a request of me is going to be sorely disappointed by my MS Paint skills

Nah but they show a purple Derpy clone in that episode :/

oh, wait
(\^3^/)
dammit BroZilla
Thats not backstory.

12[22:15:34] !pokemon
12:<
Show a lot of clones in a lot of multi pony scenes
Derpy's seen in Green Isn't Your Colour fairly clearly
HERRO DOCTAH
I know.
Running of the leaves is a good example
Lawl
Derpy is a pony of the highest tastes.
Running of the Leaves has a Dash clone of all things XD
he isn'T as good as tennant tho
No.
HAHA
YES
Not as good, I still like him though.
Running of the Leaves has a dash clone for a split second
In all honesty everypony does look the same.
yeah.
Eccelston is still awesome
And much prefer him to Smith.
Both times the herd of runners pass AJ or RD, there's a Dash clone
He sounds good, but not Excellent.
yeah.
The only thing that seperates anyone is Colour and hairstyle.
Smith is crap compared to the others.
Oh and breed.
I got sick and tired of week after week seeing episodes that looked almost identical in plot
lul
DAT ARM
and CM
Lawl
but body wise everypony looks the same.
she can'T hear
there's male and female too, and the 6(?) nonstandard body types
Big Mac begs to differ
There are a few variation in head style and such, maybe even stature. But essentially
male ponys have square jaws
'armless
LAWL
12and here i thought you just got tired of no misty
oh, 7 nonstandard body types: Mac, Snipes, Snails, Mr Cake, Mrs Cake, Luna, and Celestia
Yeah
Doctor WHO?
Granny smith
the bullies?
that was the last straw
I love how they avoid the name drop.
after her departure EVERYTHING I liked was gone
But for the most part ponies all have the same body structure.
12hi
Well yes, because they're all horses =p
I like Smith. He's more innocent on the outside like pre-Time War doctors, but he's dark. Look at A Good Man Goes to War
she kept me hanging on in Johto and suffering through those HORRIFIC and monotonous Team Rocket fillers
>->
Back, sorry!
Hey, horses can look a lot different
Wb
Also, Matt Smith Doc has Amy and Rory Pond.
Meh, I don't think he can act.
I have a friend from the housepets forum who goes by shamrock/challenger
Yeah.
River Song is the only character I watched for.
Maybe I hate the flipping fez.

They can, but ultimately they're all built from the same basic blueprint so to speak

I'm really surprised no one's used that idea yet
make good plushies and ebay them and you'll probably at least 5x the ammount of the materials you used to make them lol

I liked the early part of Master Quest so much that when it came time to hunt down Johto stuff that was the first one I looked for
no

the TV series?
There's a time investment too, and time is money

can't say I blame him
Xiagu :P I work for staples/business depot
Carbuncle is the best!
Ixian on FFX and Odin on FFXIII
Xiagu and all the co-workers have thought of changing the buttons to say "She was easy"
Both ponies
Xiagu so don't feel bad
Deaf: The Silence's wacky cousin
NO MICKEY NO
because Easy buttons are easy to mess with, or so I've heard?

"Durr, I'm too cool to cry out for help."
NOOOOOO

Xiagu from what my friend said it was impossible to crack it open without breaking to much stuff.
Shiny Mickey is best Mickey.
/me sighs
heck, I call my tarutaru a carbuncle in disguise lol
omfg BroZilla... that was horrifyingly hilarious crazysauce
>_>
I use Carbuncle in dissidia.
>mfw Mickey don't look same at all
tarutaru.. a meal for a carbuncle
I cant focus on Link ;-;
>_>
Why thank you :D
argghhhh I can't take it anymore, the urge is too strong
hey, hey! Hey Dari!
Psssst! Dari!
?
he's trying to get the beep
HEY! DARI! LISTEN!
/me dons troll mask
9my comp froze
9I am back now
11th doctor > 10th doctor
I'm a BLM main though, I'm actually decently well geared too
NewDCD! I fulfilled a request!
welcome back DCD :D
... again
ohai NewDCD
can't wait till I make some replacements though, Novio earring, that one int/mab ring...
lawl wut
My fursona is mainly a black mage. My Ponysona is a theif.
Mickey is a toon!
11 wears bow ties, and bow ties are cool.
umad dari? :D
and the Exranio wich represents the real me is just a gamer.
im a PLD main with rings that cost 2.5million
I played rdm though. Later war, which was way more fun
Caramel is a fag.
BLM, RDM, WHM, THF, SMN... and to a lesser extent DRK which is still 78 lol
Umad Val?
and im a RNG when i want to do some dammage with a gun
totally worth it :P
D:
and yes..a gun
im a Gun/bullet ranger deal with it :3
my blm does 6k nukes, and hopefully I'll see a 9-11k nuke eventually
oh, the lulz
Random note
THis Ipad case made me nostalgia http://rsk.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/pRS1-9583856w345.jpg
CARAMEL IS A TOMATOE
Nothing quite like a mithra with a great axe
*Tomato
caramel = cigarette
Aperently they were thinking Sahz would actually be a better repsentative for FFXIII in dissidia than Lightning
ATAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK OF THE KILLER CARAMELLLLLLLL
most mithra are perverted boys lol
Dat TARDIS
So that means if there is Dissidia three there will definitly be Sahz
Did Vivi ever get in the second Dissidia?
I'm sure they are, lol
http://tytempletonart.wordpress.com/2011/08/06/ultimate-spider-man-bun-toons-yay/
No sadly
Speaking of Final Fantasy. I had a weird idea. I actually thought of Final Fantasy tactics Classes for all the ponies
He's still my favorite FF character
I liek Freye but thats proably the furry talking
I like Freye too, I always liked her personality
god why can't I type
but Vivi is definitely my favorite character
I think the Marvel fanbase needs to learn some love and tolerance.
Spiderman is black
wat
brb
err
bbl
consider yourself lucky even though you are focusing on Link
It would be cool to have Quina
its easy to find related stuff if you want to collect things
for me its kind of difficult
common you all know you want to play as Quina.
Ultimate Spider-Man
Steiner and Garnet were my least liked in that game... Steiner got a heck of a lot better when he started liking Zidane
They killed off Peter Parker
Dash=Dragoon, AJ=Knight, Twilight=Mathmatician, PinkiePie=Mime, Rarity=Mystic, Fluttershy=White Priest
I'll admit Garnet isn't the most interesting
Really don't have a favorite ff character. Hmmm. Maybe red13
wat
I knew I liked DC better for a reason
FFXI jobs are pretty easy for most of the FiM cast
this is boring, let's switch over to breadchat
anyone bake anything nice lately
I suck at baking
Hmm
they did? huh.
What could that be?
I can cook. Pretty well actually
I was thinking Fluttershy=Summoner
i'm like a year behind on actual comics things
>idiotic
But baking, not so much
Twilight: Scholar, Trixie: Black Mage, Rarity: Dancer, Fluttershy: Beastmaster, Celestia: Paladin, Luna: Dark Knight, Pinkie Pie: Puppet Master
Ohh.
Lawl.
that's cool
Rairy=White mage Twi=Black mage
Topshot i cookled some awesome pasta
I'd say Fluttershy is BST over Summoner
lol
So sloooooow
nah Fluttershy would be the healer.
I am starting to like that doctor.
this running music is the best
Even I felt smarter than a British person right there
BST summons rabbits and what not to attack for them lol
Did you see the gas mask child episode Dermathil?
Rarity has no magic other then gem finding
Well summoners are also healers alot of the time
Dave, you felt smarter than an ALIEN
Gas mask child?
Ahh.
Sounds familir
Dancer has a lot of fashionish with them, you see it in their AF sets
She would be a mystic because her whining would cause staus effects
I love pasta
*Fa,o;oar
RBD: thief/nin
*Familiar
Those two episodes are Eccelston's best in my opinion.
12o-o
An Alien with a British accent
So, you should enjoy them.
dash I'd go with thf too
OH.
I was thinking AJ could be monk
Eccleston.
kick attacks and all
I was actually thinking of giving each poy 4 or so jobs
:D
I never saw any eccleston episode
definately
I am absolutely happy today!!!
Ah.
awesome!
Twi: blk/whm
Like, you have no idea
Like Dash's options=Theif, Dragoon, Ninja, time mage.
Schollar fits Twilight better IMO
btw KShrike have you ever played EvEonline?
Twi should be mathmatician
No
sorry
k i knew someone with a name close to yours on eve ;)
scholar is basically BLM and WHM combined, and has a lot of school look, they also have books
I play DFO, and Starcraft II
so do tell why you are so happy KShrike
Anyway, a friend of mine watched the first episode
this will take a while
I know Dash obviosly dash can't do magic but I think it makes sense for the Fasr one to get time magic skills anyway.
anywho, I need to go to bed lol
Dragoon is her perfect class imo
night every pony
Spike btw = DRAgoon lol
He posts on my wall on Facebook, and says "Well, I figured your picture is a pony from My Little Pony, so I watched the pilot, but all I could do was shake my head and not become a fanatic."
Or something similar, anyway
I'd laugh to see spike summon a dragon lol
Oh blob, it mad
So I get on Facebook Chat with him
Silvermane, you ain't in Silvershipper no more
I tell him to watch episode 3 at least.
>facebook chat
I just preper them having the option to switch between clasess. Like in FF3 but eachcharacter has four classes.
No, no make him watch Dragonshy
an hour later, he comes to me and says "Dude, episode 4 is better than episode 3". YEEEHAH!
04|D
03xD
Heh, nice
Applejack= Warrior, Monk, Defender, Geomancer. (with geomancer working more like an earthbender)
6sigh
That was awesome, I'd never been so happy before
6this computer's registry is all messed up
Oh mum

Well, I have, just not recently
04thaaat sucks

6here we are lol
Sorry, you guys may have friends in the real world that are bronies, but I haven't until just now :D
So you can understand my excitement
Spike=Warrior, Knight, Paladin, Jester
03was it some Windows Security 2012 thing?
03that's what LL had
Shit, am I the only one who hasn't heard of the extreme rioting in London going on right now?
03I fixed it for her
03:P
>_> <_<
did he died?
I haven't. :o
pony time
Riots about what?
i heard in chat earlier today
yeah, it's been pretty nasty
6that stupid false antivirus with the 4-colored shield? that was it
I don't really
KShrike, it is a wonderful thing!
03yep]
Twilight= WM,BLUM,BM,RM
Apparently third day of riots, car bombs and all that
03LOL
hockey I believe, or some sort of sport right?
no details though. what's the deal?
Heard about it earlier yeah.
I just downloaded some guy 4 gb pony folder
03and you used Malwarebytes to fix it?
so many pics.....
6been causing issues for years, that's what ate my old laptop
6yeh
03yeah
Is this still to do about the cop that shot someone?
03same here
03and then I used that exefix_xp to fix it
03it works on Windows 7 as well LOL
Flutteryshy-WM, Summoner, Beast Master, Anamalist
They don't call it "big" macintosh for... yeah yeah. 4 Gigabyte pony folder?
because you can still run MS-DOS .com files
I'm not sure any more
I've heard too many rumors
6wait thats xp
03but for some reason there's no command.com anymore
6is it XP/win7 only?
03um
03opposed to what Aurora
6or would it work on vista
its emulated
03oh
03it should work on visa, yeah
03*Vista
03just try it LOL
but should work if you run that in administrator mode
6ugh administrative priviledges
03I just have one account only
03automatic admin
03:P
03though
03one time was epic fail
03I somehow managed to make myself not an admin
No
03and only had one acount
6my mom's paranoid about this computer now, I don't think she'll enjoy me asking to run this lol >>
03took me hours to fix it >_>
Ferals and sentients. In the furry and cartoon world it's something you get use too.
03DARN YOU FEATHER
Not really, heh
BREAKDANCE, MANNEQUINS, BREAKDANCE
03You need to try responding to me sometime
Equestria is a world where ponies are the dominant species
simple answer to a complex question
6god I'm so tired right now
6I'm gonna go
12bye
12:<
Well, at least, ponies are ONE of the dominant species
does anyone else hear random music?
No... you don't understand
Humans are to Earth as Ponies are to Equestria
03o.o
Looks like these riots are continuations of the one that started over the shooting a couple days ago. Dunno if they are still about that though.
12no i'm not
^
12o-o
In Equestria anyway
03steam says you are
^^
12i opened up tf2
12doesn't mean i'm playing it :P
Well, in a secular sense they are
As far as we know Gryfon's have their own country
03why would you open a game that you don't intend to play
Along with dragons
12i need to find the link to the tf2 video i uploaded onto youtube
And Buffalo
And whatever other characters we see in the future
sort of strange not to live in the country ruled by the two physical gods of the world
Lol, Mickey.
Howdy.
I still don't consider them gods.
12?
He likes to waste RAM :<
Neither do I
They move stuff in space.
Comparitively, they are gods.
if they can control entire solar bodies, I would consider them gods
How strong do you think they are then?
If they were imortal gods they would not need gaurds
lul
Just because "Oh Celestia" is a phrase, does not mean they are gods
Lol
http://www.zdnet.com/blog/violetblue/how-the-new-8216protecting-children-bill-puts-you-at-risk/590 < Epic fai
l
I meant it more as a figure of speech sort of thing for their power levels
In all honesty, I'd be doing the same as him though if I just went through that
Imortal to death by age.
12i want to get that tf2 achievement
The most powerful creatures in Equestia are the alicorns
gotta love mickey
EEYUP
The guards are more like a police service.
Yeah.
same here
To be a guard in a world of fantasy is to sign your death papers.
12where you get a youtube vid upto 100,000 views
idk what you associate with the term gods, so we can just stop using it
LET'S TALK ABOUT HAPPINESS
http://www.cracked.com/article_19376_5-scientific-reasons-your-idea-happiness-wrong.html
Well, they may not -need- guards
if they don't need gaurds then have thm do other stuffs.
yeah, to him he just got ate, kidnapped, and then suddenly rose and this guy
12so i uploaded some junk and put it on auto refresh
BRB IN 10 SECONDS, WUV ROSE
There are two types of Imortal
They each have lived for hundreds of years.
They do have them do other stuff. They serve as police.
lol wut
>mfw THE EHAD
Peacekeepers.
*HEAD
I mean
PINEAPPLE EXPRESS
Even in Equestria, being a guard sucks.
I get the impression that Celestia puts up with a lot more fancy traditions than she likes
One is you can't die. The other is you can live forever as long as nothing kills you.
WHATSHISNAME THE ALIEN THAT KNOWS ALL
And Really, guards guard more than your physical safety
in terms of being flown everywhere and all the proper things to do at the gala and whatnot
I think Celestia and Luna fall under the second imortal.
So...how about that Samurai CHamploo song I just heard?
Your peace, Your palace, Your holdings
omfg what is happening
Things dear to you
dat 75% slower
eeyup
I'm jsut saying. They made equestria. Not the world.
Lawl.
5 billion. lawl wut
fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive biliiiiiiiiiiiioooonnnnnn
thiiiiiiis iiiiisss the daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Demi gods at best to me.
the eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeearrrrttthhhhhhhhh
They delegate problems and annoyances
wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurld
blooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwsssssss uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupppppppp
they can control the rotation of the planet at will
Actually I don't think that canon has confirmed they made Equestria at all
that takes an insane amount of energy
anyway I still don't think we're actually successfully arguing here >__>
whoooooooooo the heeeeellllll aaaaaaaaarrrrrreeeeee yoooooooooooouuuuuu
Iiiiiiiiiiiii'm the doctooooooooooorrrrrr
This is trippy.
they move the sun and the moon. Thats nothing but powerful telekinesis
AVATAR
... oh, I guess we didn't talk about happiness
People are using words different ways :X
iii'm triiipping baaaaallls
FACE OF BO
YANA
And live on the moon for 1000 years
SPOILERS
THE FACE OF BO
I'm just saying I only think they are very powerful, and have extended lifespans.
YANA
YANA
The_Crowing: are you suggesting that in the MLP universe the sun universe revolves around the planet?
YANA
Sketch, she was imprisoned /in/ the moon, not /on/ it
THE ONE AND ONLY
CASSANDRA
THE LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAST HUUUUUUUUMAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNN
sun/universe
god wtf i hated that bitch
Ah, fair enough, but still
'moisturize me'
For Luna it was more like being frozen in a block of ice for a long time then thawed out.
Yeah, last human was a bitchy bitch
Yeah, Celestia makes the sun rise and set.
I'm not convinced that Equestria is even on a planet
9Brozilla
9I'm scanning
As I said there are Two types of Imortal.
Equestria is actually a giant spaceship.
/me begins squeeing
so, shes in control of it and that means the planet is the center of the universe
By giant, I mean planet-sized.
Lawl
Xiagu: wait, what? that happens on earth lol
killerrabbit, not everywhere at the same time
I mean like, I don't think Equestria has time zones or anything
Your spirit is encased magically in a sphere, but you are released according to prophecy, 1000 years later, become corporeal, etc
Stop talking about me.
I'm pretty sure they turn the Earth.
who says it is everywhere at the same time? we only see it in ponyville
It's always day somewhere on Earth, but I'm not sure that is the same case on Equestria
Celestia and Luna control the sun and the moon and the pegasi control the wheather
Equestria is the country.
damn, broke. Trying again.
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/124f8c456f14e9ba35030cf06689f2e8/14693%20-%20macro%20twilight_sparkle%20yes.jpg
Leave me out of this.
Well, there's the Summer Sun Celebration right? And Celestia actually does some fancy thing at sunrise, complete with horn glowing and whatnot
lol nice Dave
I'm a natural
Since when did a country gain acsess to IRC?
AND IT APPEARED IN THE STREAM I'M FAMOUS
so... it's implied that sunrise is a discrete time
/me needs to expand his vocabulary rapidly so that he can use a wide variety of words in a plethora of unique awkward situations without appearing to redundant with his words.......
DON'T YOU DARE STREAMCEPTION ON US
I usually use this name to mess with those in the RP room...
TI'm going to say it again. I beleive that Clestia and Luna can both live forever as long as nothing kills them. That and they arn't particulary easy to kill.
>mfw ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWA
Xiagu: she could easily go all over and do that
Episode 2.
YES
HORJAY
Well like... if sunrise and sunset aren't discrete times, why aren't the princesses constantly moving the sun / moon?
I can be ok with that locke
maybe they are?
FORWARD
Locke I don't think that anypony has actually disagreed with you
im pretty sure the sun rises and sets on a specific time
and she did that just for dramatic effect
>100 years
>5 billion years into the future
100 years? NOPE.AVI
/me shrugs
12,005, NEW ROMAN EMPIRE
Dat pumping.
HELL TO THE YES
Dat DIIIIIIIING
l8r
DING
hot doctor on TARDIS action
So to me Celestia and Luna come closer to ebing Saiyans. In a sense.
I remember this epi, when they were showing it on Space Network
back to the original point, it must be strange not to live in the country ruled by the two creatures with power over the sun and moon
alongside a newly started second season of Stargate: Universe
Ahh...fuck you, MGM. Killed off an amazing franchise.
5.5/Apple/26? o:
5.5-apple-26?
Don't saiyans age?
Best I could come with sketch
They do but not as fast.
Hmm.
yeah.
Fair enough
S:U should've continued.
SG1 > all other SGs
Dari = correct
>mfw apple is the symbol for 'billion'
If only because it could've tried to come close to SG1 and Atlantis
totally agree with Dari
SGU = only SG ever watched
I watched universe though.
it's a shame that season 8+ was just never the same
My other theary was that all pony ruled countries have an Alicorn.
I mean, we could prove whether the planet is the center of the universe or not
after they killed off [SPOILER] it just didn't feel right
we just need to compare the stars in the night scenes
So universe is finished then?
I think we are not given enough information. I think diety implies a level of omnipotent control in creation
Ohai Ghosties.
9it's up
Finished with an unfinished storyline
GHOSTIES!
howdy Ghosties
SO EXCITED

SO FUCKIN' BAUCE
Dave, who is that?
4Ohhhhh, I see
Gokai Red riding Rarity
Oh
9also
9GRABBIN' DOSH and LOADSA MANNI Luka
First thing that came to mine was Cobra Commander. :p
NewDCD, if it weren't for you're already fantastic singing skills, I would definitely love you long time
4I see DCD is playing Killing Floor
And Luka is mai waifu
Umpa Lumpas
just saiyan
So one of the alicorn leaders I had in mind was the one who controlled sound. Sense he could here everything at once all the time he could never here anyone.
REPEATED MEME
4Well, I'll make my leave now. See you all later
kk, pce Ghosties
9see ya Ghosties
well f course the internet would be at the end of the world
Adherents of the Repeated Meme!

killerrabbit, I know the show had high production values, but I don't think they had that...

hehehe
and he hits on the tree chick
BOE!
Doctor/Tree?
BOE
THE OH SO AWESOME FACE OF BO
MEME
Xiagu: tbh, I doubt they even considered it in the outline
Another was an alicorn who conrolled all the colour and could see colours no one else could because he could see all types of light.
indeed, feels bad man. So much potential in it.

Yfw THE EVIL GUYS ARE BLACK
(black cloaks I mean)
But their balls are white
I'm having trouble thinking of what's left, though.
Would be interesting
/me turns to Pokemon legendaries....
(They're orbed spheres I mean, which are silver)
grid spiders?
I'd imagine it would actually be worse to hear everdehing everywhere at once than to just plain be death
Xiagu that is exactly what I was talking about
I find it too hard to accept that the universe orbits around the planet
Locke, you made up more alicorns. That doesn't help, we need magical dragons and griffons or something
/me shrugs
Rams, totally
killerrabbit, they're probably not in a full sized universe slash past this point the show doesn't make any sense
whatever dood make up your own stuff.
Pandora's Moon
She's a Na'vi
Heh
Plus who said it had to be the universe. they only lift one sun and one moon.
Its probably just that galaxy
Xiagu: it doesn't matter on the size of the universe, it would mean that the planet would need an enmormous gravity well to have stars orbit it
then you have the problem of, how strong are these ponies to survive that high gravity, and still be able to jump/fly/etc.
Well the stars don't orbit around it. It is controleed.
There is an easy explanation to all of this.
so, there is conservation of momentum?
er, no conservation of momentum*
All the lights in the sky ....aren't actually stars then
ITS FANTASY NOT SCIFI!
I don't care if it is scifi or fantasy, it is still fun to analyse things like this
Different universe, it's hard to argue with any perspective
What skethc said.
Going with the interpretation that Luna put all the stars there, they might not be miasmas of incandescent plasma after all
DAT'S RACIST
9I think I'll try moving the game to /chat/"
>Rose's face she doesn't notice the loud click-clacking of the spider
They could operate with entirely different rules. Celestial
Sorry, celestia may store the sun as a marble at night
>deep south
My goldfish says they mark the location of every Starbucks in the galaxy.
Damn cell phone keyboard
I need pictures
Pictures of Nightmare Moon

so, now were back to that celestia/luna are gods
!link nightmare_moon
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/35053
oh, he mad
because the ability to just "pick up" the sun and store it for the night would be quite godly
Would be neat, Lol
to be fair, this is kinda an inactive time for people in my timezone
mfw IT WORKS
it might pick up tomorrow morning...or later today depending on where you live
9Moved thread to /chat/ http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/36494465.html
I mean, that's sort of what happens right?
I switched off the Sun
Xiagu: I guess, but what about the shape of the planet? it has to be flat in that case
but if it is flat, how does gravity work?
I've been suspecting that Equestria is flat for a while now
killerrabbit, iiiiii have no clue

WHERE IS BAD WOLF
The tiny blue guy said "it's the bad wolf scenario"
The fat guy who sits on pillow.
I think it's powered by friendship
hellooo.
oh
regardless, I still think celestia/luna are gods and not just princesses :D
I read so fking much about bad wolf
the ground really likes ponies and wants to be closer to them. The more of a pony there is the more it likes them
...I think they're god-tier princesses? :3
Xiagu: the ground hates pegasi then eh? XD
A little boy.
Wut
agreed with xiagu
boy?
killerrabbit, there's not as much of them, they have hollow bones and whatnot
Thought that was a chick

Everytime I come across something marked as Questionable on Ponibooru

Killerrabit: On the contrary, the ground loves pegasi. It's why they crash into it should they stall in flight.
I'm like, what questionable
Then I see it

OK that's questionable.

Must have just been a phrase
but ponyville, the main town/city in the show, was founded by earth ponies, so that is probably why you see more earth ponies than other kinds

Hi!
What the hay Topshot
Xiagu wins an internet.

/me punshes his monitor
Also, that would be a terrible cutie mark, because after they get it..... ?
MLP:FiM is anime enough
No need for more anime
http://guiltfreegames.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/pic693451_md.jpg this mat
epic leaf dog thing that I have no idea what is is epic
Looks like we have to keep crusadin'.... ?
Neat
No, see, their Cutie Mark is of a miniature pony with no Cutie Mark
my goat anime
what card game is that? lol
never heard of battle spirits...
And then they find that pony's Cutie Mark, which is another blank flanked pony
I have no idea, I use it when playing magic. When I play magic. which is like not at all anymore
NOPE
Whose Cutie Mark is yet another pony with no Cutie Mark
I play mtg legacy
and so on and so on and so on
FUCK YOU, BITCH WHORE
....it would be cool if their talents were helping other ponies find their cutie marks I guess?
FACE OF BO SURVIVED
BUT WHAT ABOUT HER BRAIN HUH?
User_5228, do paint ships taste that good?
chips*
nvm.
fail
but I thought that mat was cool, and it was like 10 bucks, so I was like.. what the hell
03are you here?
meh, I don't use any mats, don't see the point
12she's at school D:
the point: they look cool
lol
also they make cards easier to pick up since they're squishy
It was flattenised.
:P
Now, see, I couldn't do that
and depending on the deck, I need more room than a mat would give
it's like a +1 bonus or so
true. and tables can be sticky :(
Bleh I give up
Watch the end of the world, nearly be murdered, and then go back to present day
TIME WAR
two mats? heh
I use 4 mats when I play Yugioh
CIVIL WAR
dat time war?
2 mats? now that's getting pretty big XD
The Doctor - Destroyer of Worlds
why would you need 4 mats? the max cards on the field in yugioh is 11...
But then DAVID TENNANT OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE
because yugioh has weird limitations like that
I really ahve no idea what the whole story is behind it
They're stacked on top of each other
/me is in one chat room talking about playmats, deckboxes and cardgames, and is in another room where the bot will let him roll d20's
Like invisible guns.
/me and they are both brony related.
Man why is this so hard ot find
GWEN COOPER
/me feels very. VERY geeky right now
OHAI
why do you stack the mats? -.-
and i am eating letters.
Why not?
Sketch: Don't
because stacking the deck is cheating! :D :D :D
because then you have to carry 4 mats around and pick up 4 mats if you want to move to a different table
So?
Roll them up
Problem solved
naw it's ok Paul_McColtney, might as well embrace it right?
just seems inefficient :P
Sketch: Correct
Wut, WHERE WAS GWEN COOPER AND TENNANT IN THAT LAST PEOPLE SCENE?
Gwen Cooper was 17th century, Dermathil

ANYWAYS. I'll be taking my leave, my eyelids are starting to function independently of my will.
I think my best bet is finding some random anime/game store online
/me is now considering reviving his yugioh deck
Ok, cya.
He says that Gwen looks familiar, and asks if her family goes back to the 1860s...
or something to that effect.
Glances at Rose, talks about timey-wimey genetic whatevers
'ello again spitfire
and prolly is PsychicKid
Oh.

Brozilla you missed the important bit
The fandom is large enough that you'll find all kinds of different people
Art of the Dress in 8bit reminds me of Lavender Town

Nice VicViper
VicViper, judging by the comments on the Mall one, no, you aren't

If I wanted to just re-install windows vista (I know) could I just download an iso
and like, not have to mess with anything else, just mount and install
bah, keeps cutting out
okay yeah...that's pretty badass DCD
Okay, time to go to sleep, then work on Happy Luna fic in the morning before going off to geek out with board games in the evening.

FREEZING STREAM MAKES ME RAAAAGE
Well no abbreviation for me
I'm just kidding killerrabbit, it's mostly not like that any more
Sorry for sounding like a robot but uh
VicViper, check to see if your encoding is UTF-8
It keeps freezing on me too, but my connection seems to go to shit at night anyway...
What the hell does that even mean
There basically is not anything on here at all
It was going just fine before I double-chatted....
I cannot run anything through search like services or dxdiag or ipconfig
ah wait, I forget not everyone is using a chat client
nothing like that
mine's freezing too, but at least it's not skipping ahead when it starts again
disregard :)
Nah it is just another one of this computerès problems
offline?
éé fun.
wat
Man I need a pony hit today.
now it works
Today has sucked balllllllllllllllllllz.
so confuzed
same here
Hmm.
If you see them out of place itès because I donèt want to not abbreviate my sentences and sound like a robot
had to click the tiny refresh button
Freezing usually means your connection isn't fast enough for the stream.
Any photographers here? 'cause you'll get this. You ever shoot a roll of film, go 'HOLY SHIT I GOT SO MANY AWESOME PICTURES', develop it, and go 'Okay I am never shooting in aperture priority mode, nor am I ever shoot at 1.8 ever again'?
Maybe I'll lower the bitrate.
hmm, interesting. It's all of you ' <<
I have four out of five from my internet connection
five bars*
lol
^^
not sure why this is such an issue
>>your

Haw haw
Yeah, I have to keep moving my laptop, but it's working fine now.
Pizzicato, all blurry?
I just noticed that my left eye is slightly blurry
I just noticed that I'm legally blind
Pizzicato: One some of them, yeah.
They didn't develop evenly, either.
http://fav.me/d3ixs32 < fluttermac
film has one advantage over digital
pizzicato what do you shoot with
agh it did it again
Topshot: Minolta X-370 with a Rokkor 50mm 1.8 and Ilford 3200
I got one keeper out of the roll http://doctormowinckel.com/pictures/photomragraphones/good_shot.jpg
you can fake it with image bracketing, though
And it is a pretty good shot.
New post on Equestria Daily by Cereal Velocity: Story: The Sun Is Tired (Update Part 10!) (http://tinyurl.com/3s8k3rx)
!umbreon
Interesting.
12nooo
Pizzicato: Do you shoot art or commercial?
That was scanned with a flatbed scanner, not a negative scanner.
I'm guessing art.
anyway does anyone here like the gradius series
Psyentific: Dude, Ilford, film? Yeah, art.
Low light candid photography is my thing.
I see.
What do you shoot?
Actually it's my father that does the shooting. He shoots Microstock
I like to shoot with my 50mm 1.4, awesome low light, but soo shallow
Mostly though, he just futzes around in Photoshop.
Yeah dude, don't calculate your DoF.
Then you'll never shoot stopped down.
Quick someone come up with a random pony name.
Flaming Air
original name
Berry Punch
Ivory Melody, she's a pony who plays piano?
New post on Equestria Daily by Phoe: Story: Age of Terra (Update Part 3!) (http://tinyurl.com/6zrv689)
First name
Thisisaponyname
That's a pony in my fic, BACK OFF.
Broken Gear - He fixes things.
But yeah, when you're shooting at 1.8 with 3200 iso film, you take a shot in total darkness, develop it, and pow, Narnia's on your negative.
Oh wow
blarg. Well I have to work early and long for the sixth day in a row. So I'm gong to hit the hay. 'night bronies
Not total darkness, but http://doctormowinckel.com/pictures/photomragraphones/also_good_shot.jpg this was taken in really really low light, at like 1Am, on a balcony. The only source of light is behind her.

Oh hey. An interview with Sansha Kuvakei. BRB Nation Calls.

Yeah, I don't watch TV at all.

the only thing they do is like
display my games on them
I wonder if Derpy is mexican
least evil badguy ever. he even obeys the traffic lights
derpy is equestrian

If you say Ramirez I can only say
Paul_McColtney: I only watched ponies because an irl friend of mine gave me a dvd with the first few episodes on it :P
RAMIREZ! DEFEND THE BURGERTOWN!

Grenade launchers are already used incorrectly in COD anyway

bbl
Bloody grenade launchers
OMG! L337 360 Gren8de launcher double kill ftw

that reminds me of a FiM fanfic's tags...
I have a n00b tube
360 midair noscopes
"Angel/Spike, no Buffy"
Call of Duty has a terrible community.
that's why I hate CoD

terrible community for a terrible game, makes sense to me

OH NOES
Yes it does Plorf
12kk
That had to be a reference.
But I still play it
I was playing it this morning, in fact
/me tucks her socks under her.
had to
Then I put on BFBC2
... i'm not kidding.
hi
I have Black Ops from a friend, but the spawns in that game...
I prefer me too Jazza
I wear one black sock and one white sock
*shudders*
does that make me cool
So many flaws ;_;
Yup.
I haven't played it in months so it was difficult to get back into it
hay!
Extremely unbalanced gameplay.
/me doesn't use socks on his hooves
I guess I've adapted to CoD and Halo's aim assist too much
It's sometimes easy
It doesn't have aim assist?
That's pretty cool.
/me neighs
They always burst into flames >_<
should I get a PS1 for $10
Yes it has none. I've heard people argue that it does (only a little bit) but from my experience it has NONE.
On a console, that's really weird.
So adjusting from CoD's EXTREME aim assist to BFBC2's no aim assist was bloody difficult
guys
should i get a ps1 or what
(after months of not playing BFBC2)
Yes Vic
I'm more of a Halo guy.
what games should I get
I would buy a SNES
... Mega Man 8?
anyone seen johnny guitar?
ha spike is a nerd
I have an NES
and a Sega Genesis
and a Wii and a DS and an xbox 360
He's still badass.

DVD - "Do some exercise you dumb shit"
silly kerrang. I don't want to lose weight, i want some motherfucking heavy metal
Have you tried turning it off and on again?

Or at least aluminum studs, since unlike lead paint, they're used in buildings these days and will pass inspection.
I cant understand why
/me might actually be watching Scuzz. Isn't sure any more. comment still stands.
Try it out on a different computer in the same room

Are you using wired or wireless? There could be interference

Its work perfectly....weell

Is your sister on a wireless connection as well?
Its worked pretty good until recently
And nothing has changed
but yeah. you pay £99 to wait for a DVD to get shipped to you, to put it in the player and stand there in front of your TV like a moron watching a toned guy say 'lose some weight'

No

And all I could do was laugh
Hooray for syringes

it also dries brown

WAT A TWEEEST
Oh I'm sure My Little Pony News will highjack that article!
I'm giving my TF2 a full Medic Aperture combo :P
It's like those guys never post any original content, what's up with that?
Meet the medic, Is the best Meet The so far
I actually write for MLP News. If something breaks on EQD, we source and give credit.
I liked Meet the Engineer.
^this
Meet the Medic is just so.....AWESOME
Though I think I'm saying that now 'cause AJ is my favourite pony.
Hey look buddy, i'm an engineer
I thought meet the medic was pretty unfair
AppleJack?
WELP
FUCK
Meet the Soldier is really good, too.
sword arm
Meet the Medic was the shit.
that sure is awkward
That isnt how you spell PinkiePie
It as longer than all the others had more in it and got so much time to be made
Meet the Spy was Amazing!
i lol'd with Meet the Soldier
Yeah, I've been there.
Meet the Medic is the best
UNLESS IT'S A FARM
Period.
Yeah, the closing line is brilliant.
Meet the Spy made spies 20% cooler
o_0
everyone else was just sorta screwed over when it came to the medic's video.
ARCHEMIDES, NO!
Terminator!
I personally think Meet the Spy is the best because it was just dramatically epic
wait what?
I agree
"He could be you, he could be me! he even could-"
*ded*
he seems like a random target...
I think it is pretty late in TF2ès lifetime to still have any meet the team videos left to release
The best part is probably with the Spy head
See He'll turn red any second
Kill me
Later
the game has been out for almost five years, seriously valve
He's a PM or something.
See RED! No Wait that's blood
Strategic choices.
Meet the Pyro is all that's left?
http://is.gd/Jfv7C9
It won't take THAT long
Yup
Pyro:Meet me
knowing valve it will
What.
Meet the Pyro is going to some seriously epic shit.
I know
It's been FOUR YEARS, man.
Pyro: Meet me
Medic: Later
But i think there delay is because he cant talk
Oh. THey're setting up for the invasion. . .
Pyro: Meet me
VALVe: Later.
HL2 EP3: Make Me
Pretty much
nah
Gabe Newell: Later
Pyro is my favorite class, I hope they make it awesome.
I used to like Pyro
Valve Fans: Announce it
Gaben: Later
But i like the Medic WAY more
I can't stand Pyro.

Bitches, when I go Medic, the team doesn't need another Medic.
^happened to me once

I killed a spy once
Watch me create a Time Paradox.
With my medi gun >:3
then suddenly
Man it always happens to me.
BOO YA
I just created a Time Paradox.
9 medics
in a team of 7.
WE HAVE 6 MEDICS
What the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
I've always had good luck not getting a bunch of Medics.
I'm not a battle Medic, at all, I'm pure defence.
You dead.
i like to go medic and not heal anyone
We had a team with 3 Heavies, 3 Medics(Including me)
VicViper, there are people like that.
It was friggin MAYHEAM
3 Ubercharged Heavies
Massacre
Okay. I have to go after this episode ends.
By claiming that I have, which is to state that I have indeed created one, yet one has not been created. Oh wait. No.... I didn't create a time paradox. I just lied. ._.
and i ran up behind him and shouted into my mic
Ok.
Me too
Pyroh, I have gone clone raiding at a LAN party with 7 heavies on one team
LOL
Good show. I'd love to be able to see more.

Yeah, a lot of TF2 players can.

Cya.
What?
Okay every ---- good night!
I just had to :3
night :)
Night.
Uh. Pyroh. You're angering the Derped one.
ooh I want to save the world
And is it just me, or is 2Fort a really Medic unfriendly map?
I know
It happens alot
eats badgers? not whole i hope
Im use to it
I have really bad luck on 2Fort.
We do not anger... the Derped one.
Friendship is Magnetic. That is what I thought that said.
lets watch that again.
Just give her a muffic
12lol
And shes good
Really bad, I'm usually in the single digits.
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
Don't play 2fort

Friendship is magic, bitch
Muffins!! You have any? :3
Thank you!!

2FORT SUCKS NOOB MAP :P

If you want to be good at TF2, never play 2fort
!muffin
/me plugs her ears with some muffins
Muffins won't solve your problems forever.
Like a boss.
AW
/me just idling ^^;;;
I think Friendship is definitely Magnetic, bitch
Heh.
12no you are just xboxing
lol
/me arm pumps must triumphantly
*most
I know 2Fort, I'vebeen playing it for four years, but I still always end up dead on the bridge, or in the tunnels with no one to heal.
lol princess horse
I don't see why people like 2Fort so much
There's no winning on 2Fort.
For a Medic, at least.
Or leg pumps. Or whatever.
lol hi
oh celestia
you so silly
:3
PYROH! WISE FWUM YOUR GWAVE.
I just turtle as engy on 2fort because it's easy
Haha.
Cause i have
not in the intel room, obviously, because that's overdone
and I'm too hipster for that
Running one second, dead the next
I haven't played Granary or Gravelpit in forever.
Heh, when I go engy I hide my teleporters in the hay
mmmmmBEYY-IITCH

>_> I just wonder what EquestriaAfterDark is up to.
12weird
Sex, probably.
....
Yup
Sex is okay.
...
Why don't you find out? #EquestriaAfterDark
It's ok
I had sex with people last year, it was pretty great.
Just not acceptable
bananas: the atheist's nightmare
Maybe just a peak...

Except this time at night we usually get our own conversations and the silly RP dies down
/me coughs
Old mail too
...
holy crap Dashite's still here
Fanfics and fanart usually, though today they were talking about video games for 2 hours
Dari, you've got a competitor.
I told you. Dashite is always here.
I enjoy video game discussions
for supreme lurker of bronystate
Wow
I could talk a lot about TF2 and Halo on a very detailed level.
That's on topic allright
....
XD
You know what? I checked.
how did you find out about it?
the movie night I mean
Me?
ah.
Talking about the internet browser you use and what version? Stuff of nightmares.
gotcha.
OMG
Why?!
Ponies in socks?
What?!
Do not understand!
Ah, Dari is talking again.

how long has it been since you slept dari?
/me yawns

And then the usual competition begins. People are so simple to predict.
02morning~
No one told me where I could buy fancy socks when I asked earlier
I dont get it though
I wear white socks.
ah.
/me notices some smoke coming from the back of Pyroh's head
:| I think EqD is more pervy than EqAD.
This whole new socks fetish
You okay buddy?
NO!
I wish I was here in the beginning :P
Theres a kettle in my brain D:
Of course im not ok
We're the ones talking about socks. XD
Sorry to interrupt guys, how do I set a password to keep my username?
Lycan, that was just the content filter we set up
Dari, you sound tired.
hey dari
It hides the true horrors of the conversation, you have to decrypt it first

I'd never be able to go that long without a hair cut.

Do not care bout spelling

I don't know the words to it from memory

Why are you always getting shot?-- *shot*
AtomicBrony, sooner or later, I shall run out of bullets.

Ponybro?

Who the hay is shooting at us?!
Pobro

When its long enough that I have to comb it after stepping out of the shower it's time to get it cut again. :p

PLEASE
you just got it bro
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi24yLYwZ_M
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
Twilight told me this video is about Rarity is a Creeper
How do Ponies play Basket Ball
Magic
everything is magic
But... but! What a ripoff!
Why do you do this to me Pyroh
lol Atomic
Do ponies play Basket Ball.....huh
12o.o
Also -- the same way they play football
Of course they do.
Hay for thought
No! It's all mine!
Mine I say!
/me chucks a pillow at Octavia...hits Rarity.
Hoof(foot)ball makes more sense than basketball but both are plausible
It.
Could I get it in writing?
Is.
ON.
so what was the tune?
/me claps happily!
Friendship = Magic, Magic = Life, Friendship = Life?
FUCK
HOW DID I MISS THAT??
Ponies clap?!
naah it was heavenly.
I thought we stomped our hooves on the ground instead
GOD DAMMIT POLARFIRE! WHY THE FUCK DO YOU SWEAR SO GOD DAMN MUCH?!
I'm just stoopid at 3 am.
Both!
...
Pyroh, that's called ``clapping'
'
u mad bro?
In PonyVille it is
The clicking of hooves produces an interesting sound.
Apprently
/me attempts to clap human-style and falls backwards.
Yes. I am absolutely furious.
....
yep dari you were right.
So dari how many different programming languages do you know?
Ludovician, y u no sit down?
for lack of a better question
Didn't you watch Twi do it?
Wow, Rainbow's house is PIMP
Ludovician your legs can wobble and bend. Did you see how Celestia waved in Sonic Rainboom? They flopped all around the place
Yes but twi has magical powers
Its more of a mansion than a house actually
.... Stuff you can work with. Like anything more than the basics I guess.
I'm an earth pony.
Where do they show her house?
yeah, let's just go with that.
they show her house twice
party of one is good one
griffon brush off
In Various episodes
Her house is different each time
which ones?
well, its a cloud
I'd assume that errypegasus's house can be made at will
Is anything in the backround EVER consistant?
cloud house *
That would be a no
Very true
But you have to factor in it being a cloud
Java? *bows*
Colgate occasionally misplaces her horn.
Which one did you start with?
Hides it in her hair is a nice and simple solution to that mystery
ah.
It's retractable?
Seriously, Once i swear i saw 2 Backroun ponies standing next to eachother
did everyone else leave? :S
I was thinking Poison Joke like
yea I thought that too but didnt want to say it :p
Orbit
Well that or she can REALLY hide her thick hair
D:
heh

In my Spacesuit
wow. tough intro.

/me eats cake in mid air

AND HE WAS GONNA GIVE ME 50 MILLION DOLLARSSSS!!!!!!111!!!
Thank you!
I'll watch you like a Gryphon, Fooby.

No problem

Adieu Plof and bon voyage
*clopclopclop*
Hey guys im thinking of writing a ponyfic. mind if I ask some questions about some ideas im having?
I'm ok with this
Hit us Ludo
:3
ok so
hey dari are you ever going to visit the US?
12nooo
its an alternate universe one
Beta name Equestrion for now, until i think of something better
Main difference is, Luna's in charge.
But Luna gets taken back to Equestria in episode 1 and the story is about a few ponies who go to try and 'rescue' her
you should come see me.
So a color opposite of Equestria?
I will buy your food.
define color opposite?
:P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY Has this been linked here yet?
EEEEEEeyesIam.
It's mostly the same except for the pony in charge. But since it's Luna they suffer from eternal night which stunts plant growth and life is less carefree
Like Black i s White
Oh
!Link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY
Twilight told me this video is about Friendship is Magic Bitch
Well wait
It's still a concept
"Do you like bananas?"
...
down to 3.
/me likes them apples.
so what next?
...but what about THEM apples?
/me points to the other half of the grove.
how about some sex? :P
The portal to Equestrion is the moon I'm guessing
Ludovician: also check out #EquestrianStudy
I haven't figured that out yet. I'm toying with the idea of having Derpy split between worlds explaining the derpness
So Equestrion is basically the opposite of Equestria
dashite?
thanks blacklight. I went in there earlier but didnt see anypony talking
"You're going to go bananas..."
"ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!!"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQlIhraqL7o
In a way
It's mostly the same. However they won't spend much time there since they will be going to Equestria near the beginning
that flash animation was so random
So's your name.
...
although, imo, it would have been funnier if luna messed up celestia isntead of getting launched to the moon
Well then u should be in this discussion
cause thats the beginning of the concept of my story
still there lunasta?
So: Eion is polar opp of Eia
and Eion needs Luna?
So the ponies cross over to Eia
yeah pretty much
to get Luna
Got it
I plan to have them interacting with the mane cast of the show, but following the general timeline of the series
>bag on head
>it still counts
... wtf is that featured video
Does it seem like a decent idea, or do I need to rethink it?
So they interact in the same timeframe as the show, but in between the episodes?
>.>
wellokthen!
It's not bad if you can work it out.
Or during the episodes with other characters. For example some characters are absent for parts of the show and for entire episodes sometimes
…wow
I know what we're going to do.
I'm going to need to plan it out but im hoping to make it reasonably long
total Trollestia
http://www.ponyspin.com/
brb though gonna get my food before it gets cold, eating in here thop
tho
Well stories can only work if the author can work it out
!muffin

yes
Thank you!!
/me glomps hotwheels14901

/me gives hotwheels14901 a searching look and then flies off to #EquestriaAfterDark
So what do you think about the idea of Derpy existing simultaneously in both worlds?
dari?
G'night
He's disappeared :O
/me stabs Atomic with a double dose of Lunasta
u leavin?

/me facesplats.

This just makes me think of the other spin site. :/
...
And it really disturbing.
meh.
There are worse
Because I'd rather not associate ponies with that.
/me wishes his food was a plate of cupcakes. Damn chicken....
not that I would know >_>
We were on the other spin site at school a while ago.
Some guy just said.
Heh, I had some dino nuggets an hour or so ago
...
"It's...Hpynotic"
lol
Was about to say exactly that! :D
some what?
XD
dino chicken nuggets
Lunasta, your name conjures up images of Luna indulging in a fresh plate of pasta.
I thought u went to sleep
Why does this chat not know the nomnomnominess of dino nuggets?
dari give me some warning if you fall asleep
They probably do
No, that was Atomic
Dari
How? :P
Beep. :D
idk. write a script.
:P
and it seemed a few other ponies left as soon as I started talking about my story lol. I saw 4 simultaneous logouts :p
A script that messages the channel if my pulse drops enough? :P
why not.
you're a genius.
:D
Hah, that's probably the people who just idle in here
I need to find something to take my pulse first. XD
lol.
one of them was Pyroh
Like that one ^^^
So yeah if u answered i didnt see it
any feedback about derpy?
hi
Hello bros.

Heyo MrMooMoo

It killed chat and made us all even sleepier than we already are.
Hopefully there will be moar cows in season 2..

DerpyMail USPS STAMPS!?!?!
Woah
XD
Woah people use stamps?
OH YEAH!
So skype? before I perish at the hooves of spinning applebloom?
DERPY STAMPS!
Do they taste good?
Gilda: Stamps, woohoo.
if you want
(for the rare times I actually use the US postal service…)
OH YEAH!
WHY HAS MY DAD NOT MENTIONED THIS TO ME!?
LOL
>mfw I've been singing that for the past 3 minutes now
Heh, anything going through the mail is usually junk, bills, and mostly packages
lol.
Stamps are held up by glue. •_•
...
DOHOHO
A "hole"
what hole? :P
I see...
Hey dari since we are supposed to be linked, what am I thinking?
Great, now make stamps for australia so i can use the
m
think hard
you can doo eet
Don't hurt yourself.
I'd mail a blank piece of paper just to send the stamp to someone
lol
ok maybe not that hard.
woops, *somepony*
SSSSS
SSSSS
SSSUUUU
Why waste a sheet of paper when you can just send the envelope?
He's thinking about pony.
SSSSUUUUBBBBBB
because they would probably notice it's empty and not send it
SSUUUUBBBWWW
why do they care if it is empty?
why ruin a stamp with a post mark?
well yeah that, everyone thinks pony
dunno lol
Send stamps to youre self
dude you just said it pretty much.
pointless ^
YES :D
Also, random question since im new to this, I was looking through EqD and im wondering, where did the term 'shipping' come from?
How about sending a stamp inside the envelope that
has been cancelled
so the recipient has two stamps
sounds good
relation-shipping.
ah.
you can turn it off XD
Shipping usually means romantic interests between two chars
yea i knew that i was just wondering about the origin of the word
Keep it going! How long can you take it?!
Not really but in this fandom, yeah.
Ludovician: shipping has been around for a long time
but it provides good BGM for the chat
Survival of the fittest!
yea but i havent
hey dari, are you gonna finish this video too :P
all the way to the end?
I ship stamps with Derpy
I stamp ships with Derpy.
lol.
I Derpy stamps with ships.
bleh.
er.. blacklight.. i dont even... what?
Derpy stamps ships with I.
With stamps Derpy I ships.
I stamp the sides of mail-related government property (mail vehicles, mailboxes, etc.) with solid colors, then Derpy
Ludovician: you know the (relation)shipping thing?
Ships stamp Derpy with I.
click it XD
ya
It just goes to... a page.
one might say, for example, ‘I ship Lyra with Bonbon’
(…I guess…)
Favorite ship. Go!!
thats what I thought u meant, hence my response
With ships Derpy stamps I
so I'm making fun of that with the whole Derpy postage stamps thing
I notice that the add doesn't include best pony...
DerpyxStamps
‘I ship stamps with Derpy’
IJNS Yamato!
Oh, wait THAT kind of ship
meaning, I send postage stamps with Derpy on them…
I ship the Titanic with icebergs. It never ends well.
yeah
I Titanic the Ship with icebergs
I with icebergs Titanic the Ship
I iceberg the ship with Titanics
FAIL!

Hey there ponies. Can anyone tell me the most known MLP forum? Its a shame EQD doesnt have one...
XD
I don't browse mlp forums :/
Ponychan I guess
GAME OVER!
Ponychan.net
D:
lol. too much ghosties
are image boards considered forums?
/me adds Ponychan to favourites.
so what now?
nope :S
:O
rare!
Theyre better
you're not online are you dari?
eh, I prefer regular forums
yeah
meh.
having to post pictures everytime you want to start a topic is annoying
Dashite does yoo have eet?
usually ponies like User_2640 join, stay a few seconds without saying anything, then leave the channel or quit with client quit
I don't really know if there are really any major forums
http://i.imgur.com/KwneF.gif
Maybe...
well do you WANT me to quit? :D
can always just post one of the million and a half random pinkie pie pics out there
no…
it's better with more ponies
well yeah, but that isn't the point :P
Theyres a lot of pony threads on like every forum
dari I love you.
http://i.imgur.com/duEA0.jpg
So anyway let me tell you about my crazy idea i got yesterday.
Hit us
Yes.
A Dash/Applejack ship?
…don't hit me
Revolutionary
I've been humiliated enough
/me laughs into her hooves
!seen DerpyBot
Look into my eyes.. 6_9
/me puts her front hooves on Lunasta's shoulders.
Hetrosexual relationshipping?
I see the derp... 6_9
While surfing the web i noticed the 3D ponies(even IRL) dont look as nearly as good as the 2D ones.
MrMooMoo, now thats an odd concept.
/me glares at Octavia
it's NOT FUNNY
they have a hard shape to make 3d
/me laughs more
So you suggest steamrollering all ponies.
It's the shading 2640
/me would fly off in a huff, but…you know
Have you seen garrys mod ponies?
hmm you didn't show up? I reload
there are good 3d models
just look on da
The show is very bright but IRL the lighting and shadows and sometimes the material quality isn't up to what we expect
So i thought - what is the best way of doing a game (non flash) that would be 2D to look good and be very fun to play.
there you are.
:3
I still want full TF2 pony mods.
:D
And it hit me - an adventure game!
User_2640: uh... that is insanely broad
Cell-shading would work, if that's not too retro
RPG?
hmm so skype then?
Platformer?
ok.
PonyDuels?
lol.
Shooter?
Like if any of you know the old broken sword series
Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
I quite like cel-shading
lawl TASTE THE RAINBOW
/me bangs her script in the head with a bowstring, "Stop prepending."
O.o?
point and click 2D adventure. the problem with this would be that a lot of 2D art would be needed, like characters and backgrounds
IT
IS
TIME

Good morning
Whatever happened to that pony dating sim?
Its not canceled
*Flutterguy* I don't wanna talk about it.
Are they still doing the 3 versions?
and i found out the most suited engine for it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Game_Studio
Dating sims...
/me facepalms
As if this fandom couldn't get any more creepy....
I never played a mlp flash game
What's so creepy about dating a charater from a little girls tv show?
!check facebook.com
It's just you. http://facebook.com is up.
Well I kinda creep myself out sometimes thinking bout fluttershy...
lies
I mean
there has been much worse done to them than a date, /shrug
Meh theyre teenagers too
!check http://lifehacker.com/
It's just you. http://lifehacker.com is up.
...they're ponies....
....why has nobody mentioned that yet....
shh, not so loud.
/me hands FallSilently a slightly larger pin for the bubbles to burst.
/me accepts gratefully and adds it to his collection
Spike: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I'm not really looking forward to the finished product as I am of the reaction to it
they're ponies yes, but they have very human qualities to them
Im not physically atracted to ponies
Neighter am I.
people can easily be attracted to the personalities and not the physical body
Eeyup
Oh my Luna. Did I just unintentionally make a pun?
:|
Personification to a large degree
But the human art..
Yep that's a pun indeed Lycan
*hoofpump* AWESOME.
regardless of anything, we're all still sitting on the internet in a mlp irc channel. derp.
*or pawpump cuz I ain't got hooves*
Suddenly awkward in here....
…not really?…
personally, I want to check out the date sim when it is done, /shrug
But still. Fanart's making it increasingly hard to not be attracted to cartoon mini horses. <__>
Its the internet. You cant be awkward.
Meh, whenever I play a date sim I look right for where the cheats are :D
Fanbase y u complicate my feelings for Twilight Sparkle??
up up down down brings new meaning to cheat code.
Lycan: Me too!!!
Octavia: that was painful to read -.-
/me bows graciously.
The real question is, why do you have feelinsg for Twilight? Fluttershy is better.
…okay, NOW it's awkward
Without the fanbase my favorite pony would of been fluttershy
I like fluttershy, but not in that kind of way ;)
Cuz she's basically me, as a girl. And as a pony. With magic.
/me silently drops out of the conversation
my sinicism mute button is broken.

Then I don't want to be right. :3
It's ok, you are not.

It doesn't?
Is there a way that I can block connections from the ethernet ports of my router?
no, I joined recently and tried to do one
I think I know which PC is downloading their collection

Did the hub just stick Terry McGinnis, Applejack, and Pinkie Pie into the same machine just now during the commercial break?

I don't recall the exact reason they decided to run
Although it does lead to a hilarious sequence of them running in front of the sort of shot that would usually be used for driving.

There's then the bit with Batman running while carrying a bomb
When was that?

Awesome.

It'd be nice if the settlers had had some more imagination with their place names.
Hey Sketch.
Hiya Summer
what time is where you live?
here it's 6:24 AM
I'm 5 hours ahead of you
My goldfish is attempting to ship Rainbow Dash with Abby Scuito. It's not working out.
i'm 6 hours ahead
12:25 pm over here
Somewhere in central Europe then klaxa?
yep
germany to be exact
Aha
I am going there in October.
I have family up there. (Not bloodline related, but family is family)
Wie geht's? :p
what? XD I don
gut, danke :)
/me hasn't spoken German much since secondary school
*I don't speak German, but I know SOME words.
Gut gut
/me has spoken german every day since i learned it as a baby
my Mother speaks for me there
Ja, ich sprache ein bisschen Deutsch.
/me knows extremely minimal german
Aber, sehr schlecht. Sorry, this is likely horrible. XD
i'm surprised you guys know a bit german
nah i'm sure any german person would have understood that
klaxa, taking a modern language is mandatory in school over here.
but german is a horrible language to learn ;_;
like srsly...
sorry guys
Amen to that!
disconected
Thing was
In first year of secondary school I had been learning French
But then we moved
:p
and the secondary school I came into had no room left in French classes
lol
so they chucked me into German instead.
join #EquestrianStudy
Still
On the plus side, it meant when I got older I could at least understand bits of Rammstein songs when I heard them.
DU HAST MICH GEFRAGT UND ICH HAT NICHT GESAGT
And so on
I did German in school, but I've forgotten most of it.
Ich habe es alles vergessen.
i'm glad english is useful
And at least one thing I love about German is that for most things if you want to describe an object you just smash a whole load of words into each other
so i frequently use it
Like Luftkissenboot for hovercraft. XD
I do plan to go back to it once I'm happy with my Polish.
mein hamster ist full of eels
Donaudampfschifffahrskapitänskajüte
i think that's the longest word described in the duden
What in God's name was that oO
the official german dictionary number one
What does that word mean XD
uh... hard to explain
so... um...
The ony thing I got out of it was fahr, for travel of some sort.
I'm seeing squares.
Mucking around with this Disqus thing could be causing that.
Donau is a river, dampfschiff is a ship that runs on steam, so a dampfschifffahrt is the process of traveling on a shit that runs on steam, and the kapitän is the captain (obvious) and the kajüte is the place where you sleep on a ship
Oh, so it's the captain's sleeping quarters on a steam ship?
How ruddy specific.
sooooooooooo
so in the end it describes the place the captain of a ship, that runs on steam and travels through the donau, sleeps
simply awesome
That's incredible XD
that's just ridiculous xD
That's almost as ludicrous as that one place name in Wales
whatcha wanna talk about, guys?
and i bet you can't look this up in a dictionary...
oh yeah i know what you mean :/
that's just... like seriously... why so long?
Is the name "Aoife" common outside of Ireland?
Not really
But yeah
Is it known?
That place in Wales is called Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
mook: you mean "Donaudamfschifffahrtskapitänskajüte" ?
klaxa, yes
I have been learning slowly how to draw ponies (FiM style)
needs maor dark.
like i said i think it's the longest word described in the german dictionary
so you should be able to find it in there
wait i'll get it and look it up
Because i plan to draw myself..
that pony creator doesnt suit me as well
Ooh so you're gonna do it yourself Summer?
More drawing is good =)
Yes
Pppsshh.. That place name in wales is nothing
I wouldnt call myself the best artist around
usually i have to give up
As long as you're not the worst
And hey, don't give up
Here in new zealand, we have a place called Taumata­whakatangihanga­koauau­o­tamatea­turi­pukakapiki­maunga­horo­nuku­pokai­whenua­kitanatahu
oh apparently i was wrong... the word i mean was "Donau-Dampfschfifffahrsgesellschaft"
....o___O @ Banana
What the hell
but i have learned that even though i am not very good at art, that if i wanna draw something so badly, and if i try hard, it turns out good
What does that even mean
That's good @ Summer
Also why are you suddenly Anon
Because thats my old user
and i dunno i had ping timeout on the other
I'm not sure if I'd be allowed to post the meaning of the name
...lol
It's dirty then
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateapokaiwhenuakitanatahu
see for yourself
Oh
It's not that bad
Not dirty at all
Unless I;m missing something.

I've seen some really daft place names before as well
Random fact, Equestria is a real place
It's located somewhere in South Africa
Allo
then why does Equestria redirect to My Little Pony on Wikipedia?
SPY!

Because that's the more well known one
what the heck? what happened while i was in the other chatroom? XD
That's not how Wikipedia works.

Interesting, Sketchy... are you certain you're awake now?
Pretty certain

...not sure what I should think of this.
i dreamt of rainbow dash yesterday night
I had a dream
it had Braeburn, Pinkiepie.. and i think Twilight..
Considering the nick I apparently referenced was PinkamenaDianePie.
this night i dreamt of ponies too... somehow... but i can't remember any detail
lucky you, klaxa
/me never dreams

how come?
I wish I could have a pony dream...
BlacklightShining, not exactly true.

Everyone dreams, but not everyone remember dreams.
ever tried telling yourself "I will remember this dream tomorrow morning" right before you go to sleep?
because it really helps

Its kind of a real mumbo jumbo klaxa.
Aw, he's gone back to Blogger.

Maybe he should dance a little and eat shrooms too.
that or lucid dream
Fireant|AFK: it helped me remembering my dreams
though if i cuold control my dreams they'd probably end up involving ponies anyway...

hello JackiePie
Sure it does. Remember, there is a lot of people that believe in homeopathy!
Hi
no i really tried
i wanted to start like a dreamjournal to learn lucid dreaming 'n stuff
so i told myself every time before i went to sleep that i will remember the dream
and i did
Awesome - do you design your dreams to be porny at least?
every time i told myself that
inb4 JackiePie quits, client quit, no reason or ‘Quit: JackiePie’

i could count in hex too
and in binary
because it isn't really hard
after 0F comes 10
Mmm
i mean was that so hard?
and 10 in hex is equvalent to 16 in decimal
also: it's not really hex, but hexadecimal
because hex would be the base of tem

which would mean that after 06 there comes 10
*base of six

Hell yeah!
"Brawny fans" is right, yeah!
'Course, they have the bronies mincing around in the animations.
Ohai Rodman
I muted it, viewing stuff right now
Oh MLP:FiM, making men out of 4chan kiddies since 2010
:D BIKER DASH!
Oh god XD
hahaha oh wow, stream is still going?
Internet High Quality - further proof that we're great! XD
Yup
al you seen 'friendhsip is magic bitch' ?
dari must be sleep-streaming
eyup
Counfound you Taiwanese newscasters, you drive us to be better than ever.
Dman: EEYUP. it even got streamed at least twice
Hahahaha awesome
I just woke up, so yah
Polarfire kept getting kicked... TO THE MOOOOOON
went to bed early, finally slept more than 4 hours first tine in weeks
feelsgoodpony
oh dear, silly mods
Brawnies XD
/me flexes
04G'night everyone
And then i died.
Hurkbleh?
Oh translator, that was supposed to be headquarters, but high quality works too.
o.0
hmm
i hate it when a story your reading runs out of chapters
What are you reading?
past sins and fallout equestria
now i have to wait for the next chapters
I want more Progress myself
That and Letters To And From A Princess
Ah. Personally waiting for The Vinyl Scratch Tapes Season 2
Want more Progress, FoE... I should finish reading Chapter 8 of My Little Western...
Parchment_Scroll, did you see the drawing I finally did of my OC Sketchy Sounds?
How long has that song been playing?
so many stories ive part read that havnt been updtaed in months or just dont update
Nuh-uh.
No idea
My memory for these things isn't so good. OK, lemme rustle you up a link then.
hmm... probably for the last four hours?
http://www.nautilus-solar.net/misc/sketchy_colours.png There he is!
I sketched out Parchment and his bookstore last night. Now I'm making the bookstore in Inkscape.
Dari just fell asleep with it on, did he?
But i thought NewDCD was streaming?
Tiiiiiight.
Before I went off, DCD was streaming, so did Dari take over afterwards?
Long legs, yeah.
at some point yep
Dunno
I see
Yep
Also
yea?
Well he's essentially an author surrogate of sorts
he streamed Friendship is Magic, Bitch and two episodes of Torchwood among other things
"Friendship is Magic Bitch" you say? Yeah, seen it
Trollestia!
Hillarious
So he had to be tall because iRL me is really tall too.
TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
i dont like inkscape
But i had a sad :( Why Luna
id much rather have a vector plugin for gimp
TO-THE-MOON-CANNON FTW!
See I hate GIMP which is why I use Inkscape
But luna :(
That and I'm too cheap for Photoshop, don't want to pirate it, and hate how laggy Photoshop is anyway.
Poor Luna :(
she just came back from the moon@
There's the pen tool in GIMP.
same, but i would like inkscape allot more if its layers tool was more friendly
Also, i guess it isn't really established, but I believe she has control over the Moon again
You can set up vectors and then have GIMP trace them with a pencil or paintbrush.
I NEED TO SEE HER in season 2
it's all pie in the sky until then though
Whilst GIMP may have a pen tool, it's still got the problem of it being GIMP ;p
Wait
what?
If Luna has control of the moon again
and really, Celestia's name would become obsolete if she didn't control the entire sky anymore
And Trollestia just sent her to the moon again
Floods, anyone?
celestia - day sky. luna - night sky : D
Hmm, Luna could flood the place, freeze the earth, make night eternal
Celestia could ... make day eternal? Burn Equestria, bring about heatwaves
:P
Anyone here? :|
Give them heatstrokes?
lul
I like Gimp. Still learning Inkscape.
I tend to just use Inkscape for inking my lines currently, and then I just colour in SAI.
SAI?
Paint Tool SAI.
Sai is pretty cool
ok, brb. g2shower
It's an excellent colouring program IMO
Though, I only use Flash and Photoshop so what do I know
And hardly draw to begin with
It's got all the stuff I'd want from Photoshop, and none of the stuff I don't need.
bai
I like to think that not a single person on the face of Earth has PS legally, outside of schools and companies
Ok, need some help
Hit me
Hai
I'm trying to get my best friend into the Herd
Lol yeah
Ah
To be expected considering the cost
But he's reluctant to give FiM a chance
That said, i think there are people that legally own Elements
Yeah, Adobe's pricing is ridicilous
I see i see
Hai gaise
Hey Everybrony
seeing as it's quite stripped down and hence cheaper.
So, I was thinking
http://i.imgur.com/hlaGL.jpg What's up bro!
ohai Dmané
Yep
*Dman.
btw, pic fail
Bring him to the Stream this friday night
Yah, I was sad when they acquired Syntrillium because it meant Cool Edit suddenly doubled in price when it became Audition.
Do you not use chrome?
nope, never.
Firefoxé
And Rodman - i've 'converted 3' and one was with this Stream
*Firefox.
Hello.
Dermathil - y u
hi
Lul
Firefox is great :)
the problem is Mibbit anyways, Dman.
http://i.imgur[dot]com/hlaGL.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/hlaGL dot jpg
Also look what happened to Flash
But yeah, I'll try to bring him to this stream
Hai
Good idea Rodman
nice picture.
Not only did it get more expensive, but worse with every new edition since the times of Macromedia
What happened when I was away for about a day?
Although they did introduce ActionScript 3.0
I'm on episode 2 - i began rewatching about 30 minutes ago
To be fair, Flash actually got a bit better right after Adobe acquired it - but I think that was chiefly Macromedia's work.
But CS5? Oh god
EPIC.
I did notice though right around v9 of Flash that it suddenly didn't have huge lagging between frames
CS3 was alright, but CS4 and CS5 are quite something

That's an interesting way to say spin
(I haven't read silent ponyville, it's on my to do list)
Anyone have an opinion on The Sun is Tired?
Haven't read it
BRB lunch
/me pauses the vid with Kamina saying 'don't screw with me, beastmen bastards' :D
Wow, my computer really doesn't like EqD
that trixie link crashed my browser
so what did I miss?
NMAtv, the crazy Taiwanese 3D newsguys posted a vid about bronies
You spound Trixie right round etc
I meant in the ponychat :p
And the Nightly Roundup is up
I'm checking it now, but it's got a few chapters</understatement> so I was hoping someone had read it. Ah well, it's starting off interestingly.
Ah, nothin'

Reposting
3 ghosts ganbanged me
He took down the spinning Trixie thingy
Probably so that the trixie wouldn't hog all the fame
that was quick
Oh
cmon there's so much trixie on this site lol
Okay
I think Trixie is pretty
But I haz teh link
but a little rude
That Trixie thing was annoying as all heck.

Yeah, it was a bit hard to make out the lyrics
Oh, I agree, FallSilently.
Need to make a dash...

/me pokes people like Espeon
ok back
Okay, not sure I'm liking the characterization of AJ in "The Sun is Tired." Hopefully it evens out...
what's she like?
!espeon
Minnet: belong to me
/me is to me
Minnet: now belong to me
Excuse me?
wtf
Minnet: please belong to me
Excuse me?
aha.
..
I'll fix that..
Oh wait
How do you log in to Minnet again?
Aaaanyhoo, I'm going to try and get some work done.
Minnet: reload commands
L[a]korv: I reloaded the command files.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvK1wBXQPAw&feature=related *Giggle*
there, now the 'belong' shouldn't trigger the 'be' command.
also
she doesn't have an ownership script
you are logged in.
Ludovician: It doesn't bug me that the impetus of the story is public fear of Celestia. It bugs me that the friggin' Element of Honesty can't tell when her best friend is being truthful with her.
K
Minnet: belong to me
Excuse me?
Minnet be floofy
O.o Parchment
Minnet floofy
Minnet: be floofy
/me is floofy
Minnet: belong to floofy
Excuse me?
Personally I always thought AJ and RD should switch elements
...
/me forcibly owns Minnet forever
Lol Dash is honest to a fault
Rainbow "She-Kind-Of-Is" Dash.
the ones they're given dont suit them
I agree, actually.
Anyone ever feel a tingly sensatiom when they're going to sleep?
Like, honest even when it's hurtful to be
Hmmm?
Not me
Which I can relate to perfectly
OTOH, AJ's being a terrible liar works out nicely.
Like, a full-body one
.-.
Nevermind
That's how I do my criticism if I have something to say. Why avoid saying it directly?
"I gotta go, uh... harvest apples. 'Cause that's what we do. It's a apple farm."
Are you referring to party of one?
Hahaha ye
**yes
g'day everypony
That definitely made sense.
the episode
?
Minnet is mine :V
The others are all pretty well assigned though
g'day stripes
Okay I'm stuck
with what?
I mean there's no way Pinkie would be anything other than Laughter
Randomness?
:P
Nope
Same diff
In a GAME
hello GGgala
Exactly my thoughts Ludo :P
hows you?
alright you
What kind of element of harmony would be randomness?
I was gonna say something about Cupcakes, but... lets stick to canon
not to bad thanks
the random kind
whats hapening here in these early hrs?
harmony... and randomness
Okay
Fluttershy is the element of Moe
moe?
perpetual ponyspin?
Ooooh! I was just thinking about how Pinkie Pie's element and talent dovetail and make Pinkie Pie sense MAKE SENSE.
Definetely moe
Randomness, the element that breaks the monotony of harmony?
what u mean by moe
Wikipedia is your friend
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_%28slang%29
wow
most bronies are asleep i think
Literally, it means "burning."
heh
/me grabs a camcorder
Or "budding" or "blossoming."
does anyone wanna rp in Bucket ofholding?
:D
To be more accurate, "moe moe" means burning.
Did that trixie post get deleted, or is it just me?
but yea i agree on fluttershy
I think it did, User_6654
kk, thanks
Seems like there could be a physical cause
so uhh.. last couple of nights I've kinda wished my cat was Fluttershy when she curls up next to me... is that normal?
And the streamer fell asleep with the computer on, apparently
I guess?
i suspect he did that on purpose, considering what's on
Ludovician: No, but it's not run see a psychologist abnormal. Within normal bounds-ish?
im confused parch
Nobody's actually NORMAL. Normal is a mathematical term.
hehe
Didn't quite follor that
Trufax
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcolepsy
Or, the way you put it sounded off
hello Rodman
It's not normal in that it's uncommon. It's not abnormal in that it's not something to worry about.
That better?
ooh what's the cam for stripes?
yea
:p
That's better
Yes. Symptoms of being a brony include (but are not limited to): seeing ponies, wishing ponies were real, dreaming you are in Equestria, and many hours logged on Equestria Daily and/or Ponychan
or wait was that sarcastic
recording the perpetual spin :)
That's not it
Worth it...
I have all symptons
I only have one of those symptoms.
Three months back, I wouldn't be the same
:(
I lay down, right?
Which one?
ah heh
Well, what am I doing right now? ;)
I close my eyes tight and focus on nothing but my eyelids
seeing ponies?
I start seeing swirls
...being logged into Equestria Daily.
My body thus starts vibrating
If I hadn't watched MLP, I would probably be chatting elsewhere and play games
WE NEED STUFF ON THE SCREEN
And my heartrate goes up (probably in fear)
If I hadn't watched MLP, I... would probably have quit my job the other day.

Since I wouldn't have anything to look forward to when I'd get home
hehe
>mfw SPIN SPIN SPIN
Good gravy, what does it say about me that I was able to identify that tune?
Since I watched the show, and after I was done with it I spent time on ponychan
Other known side effects are: engagement in pony-based visual and auditory artistry, pretending to be a pony, and creating a pony avatar
only that ur a brony
So yeah, made the job more bearable
Okay, I've got those symptoms, too.
leader
Lunasta, I only lack "pretending to be a pony" part
wait which tune is that again? WWU?
Yup.
Damn
Seeing how I've spent a week on some silly ponymation already
can i see it?
(and yes, ponymation needs to be a word)
Gah, I'm working on an AGS game.
AHEM!
Only when the spin counter will reach a million spins shall Dari the streamer come back from his restful sleep.

Hmmm
opening for what?
so i can build anticipation
Could also be something spiritual
could be anything.
I'll rather have it as a "surprise", even though it's not that special
aw k
u should ponify the opening trailer for an assassin's creed game
:P
I would but idk how
Oh well, gotta take the dog out for a walk ->

I need Pinkie Pie's waffle iron.
?
you smoke?
/me starts to play Sorairo Days
Waffle iron?
How are you gonna break a habit with that?
LOOOOOOOL Just saw my cat cough up a hairball
Reference to a fanfic, in which Pinkie Pie makes a time machine out of a waffle iron and other random things and goes back in time.
It's sweet and silly despite having grimdark moments.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7BSgWG6Kw
IIRC, it's called "Happy Birthday, Princess"

Needa finish myself mother 3 as fast as I can
Sure do
Prime numbers
...you have snow, Octavia?
I'm going out, again, this afternoon
alright
Why Dai-Guard?
"WE'RE GONNA COMBINE"
how else can i join in the winter wrap-up?
Dermathil have you seen DaiGuard yoursef?
I haven't seen it
I've missed some important conversations, I feel.
I don't HAVE snow :(
Dai-Guard is flipping awesome in SRW-Z2 and NewDCD has it on his computer yet never watched it yet
No winter wrap up
he mentioned this :P
as far as the real world goes, there is a lot of snow where i am in janurary
Ah okay, well that's a fairly good reason, I guess
so yeah, Seeing how the robot is awesome in SRW-Z2 makes me think we ought to see the anime soon
Just January? Where's that?
RobotPinkie - you're one of us! doesn't matter what you did and didn't miss!
Oh right, that's true, the herd mind
Equestria silly!
well, two years ago it started in early december and went to march
I think I must've encountered some socket error. :P
Or is it?
We never get a "lot" of snow, ever, but December and January is when it happens.
Occasionally February, I think.
was so bad this past janurary we were snowed in and could not leave for 4 days
Sniff
ugh, i can not type right
Sniff
/me needs her tummy to stop being nauseous.
Well you don't have the chillies

Heh
waiting for my breakfast to settle down
Of Course
Never heard of a sickness that can be spreaded in the internet
Breakfast... snow in January... middle of the Atlantic!
but then on the other hand, there's a ton of other mecha animes I wouldn't mind....

It's a long life, and there's a lot to see and do. Let's see and do.
And as I've said, if NewDCD decides to stream Skies of Arcadia gameplay, I'm all onboard
Indeed!
I could check a map, but beh.

I has password and everything but it's all "New computer must be verified!"
there are like 20 people on steam with the username Rainbow Dash

Still funny though, but not gonna link non-bronies to it. :P
14 pages of rainbow dash names

yeah
i'm one of them...
xD
i wonder who acts the most like dash ?
Yea
/me is confuzzled?
otherwise they'll think that's what bronies are

The one with the name of Dash, of course

I'm up to shenanigens elsewhere.
/me is trying out Dead Space Extraction
:D
I'm hungry, gonna forage for breakfast.
/me strums her strings quietly. ♫♫♫
/me wanders over and parks herself near to Octavia to listen.
/me takes a bit out of Salad_Sandwich.
/me screams in pain
^fail emote
bite
/me bucks you in the face
/me uses unicorn magic to remove your front hooves.
maybe back hooves would've been a better idea
/me conjures illusions to suit Octavia's music without really realizing he's doing it.
/me stops you with her own unicorn magic
/me notices the paradox in Parchment_Scroll's emote.
/me hmphs and sits back down. "No biting!"
goodnight
/me thinks you look so tasty....
goodnight
(what, did Octavia logout or stop?)
He's asleep right now methinks. He may be away though.
I actually do have a pic of Salad now, albeit not one I drew.

*derp*
afternoon
Morning Beatline
morning
Derpy? I love your timing
xD
altough it's already afternoon here
morning, Beatline
Almost evening here
Well, it's morning here. 9.9
And overcast as hell.
Again.
!
Here as well.
Not all that overcast, tho.
ugh, dreadful
Quite.
I presume by your name that you mean marching in a band?
Yes.
Well...
Not by my name xD
My name's an OC, and actually an electrically-centered doctor (heartbeat, pulse line).
/me yawns
*derps*
But I am in marching band, yes.
oh, other bandgeeks?
Heh.
/me noms it this time
Just coincidence then.
stop doing that
ill take em
What do you play, Beatline. I never asked.
Which is strange for me
Trombone.
In marching, at least.
/me smiles, "Oooh. Hearty. Love it."
Oh, so you play something else as well?
I'm pretty good with all low brass, though trombone's my main instrument.
nice, i play euphonium
Ah. I'm more of a string colt myself, but it's been... years.

i haven't touched a instrument in my life, i produce electronic and stuff... if i ever do

Beatline: Can you play Rufus's Welcome from FFVII?
Hello everypony.....
Hello Nuclear
hiii
Hello.
Hi
/me yawns
ello'
I could learn it, but I'm not much of a FF fan, myself.
WE LIVE TO CONTROL.
hi guys.
Whaaaaaat?!
/me throws a copy of Final Fantasy VII at Beatline.
/me catches it
my brother in law is learning an ocarina. it makes me giggle when i hear zelda songs.
I like FF just fine, I just haven't played much of the games xP
i play them with the flute *shrug*
To clarify, I mean
Did you mean this, salad? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-fleXlIRbs
I've always wanted an ocarina, but I settle for playing it on other instruments.
I have an ocarina :3
Three in fact
And yes I did
out of general comedy, im going to get my hands on a concertina
i want nothing more than to play jaunty pirate tunes
they are the best!
DO IT
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiutkHNiacE Though I prefer this version of the song
BETAMAX V.S. VHS
I only vaguely remember what a concertina is, could somepony kindly refresh my memory? xP
It's like an accordion.
Like the thing Weird Al is famous for playing.
betamax had better image quality
lol
BetaMax was technically superior
im old enough to remember them
/me imagines someone playing a concertina on a pirate ship
im old enough to remember 8tracks.
But it lost out to VHS due to greater cost and other factors.
I'm old enough to remember tapes, but not 8 trakcs.
Ah, yes, I remember now
I will get one Betamax player one day just for the nostalgic value...
Hey there, Sathi
I'm older than Salad!
Wait.
That's... that's not something to celebrate.
hey hey
Are you? I was born in 84.
Being older than people sucks.
...
?
Gah, I am 10 years older than you.
...Baaaahahahaha!
/me does a fine rendition of Rainbow Dash's gigglefit
Now I feel like a kid.
thanks guys
I'm a 36 year old married man who watches My Little Pony WHAT THE hELL IS WRONG WITH ME
ohai Sathi

haha
I've seen worse

Great

I'm like 10 minutes into dead space wii, and it's really quite good
Brony GUNNER.
That is just all kinds of fucked up.

There are older people who watched older cartoons and liked them, what's so wrong with it just being ponies? cP

There's deadspace 1 and 2 for xbox
No shit. Those instruments are electroconductive.
and pc
Sadly, I don't know how to contact them.
and a sorta prequel for wii
aww
i've not played the normal ones, but on the wii one
It's a survival horror in space
Well, we march without instruments in the rain.
You have the internet no?
yay for the wii

Umm... Yes?

diagnostician ?
luckily for you it's House m.d.
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgbNymZ7vqY
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
Twilight told me this video is about The Muppets: Bohemian Rhapsody
well alright
Ziltoid : quote: "House, i've head of you" "Yea, most have. most live in one."
Chat can't be considered dead until 5 minutes after the last entry
XD
/me starts filling a pitcher with red bull and vokda
That's the rule
I see
johnsey: ... wait what
wait really?
/me passes it to ZekeS
chug it
that's a qoute
man
nice
House is a) a medical genius b) talented in so many things c) incredible at reading others (like holmes) and d) a total ass
Oh heartburn
POUR IT DOWN!
/me nods
He's also a bit of an idiot himself, some of the things he does :P
that pretty much explains why he's so awesome!
yush
I love his dark humor
"we gonna cure death?" "MUHUHUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. doubt it"
Wait. What
?
so yea what season shall I stream?
As I told Dari, season 1 is brilliant
straight from dvd or should I download some?
IMO seasons 1 and 2 are the best, and other ones are some good some ok
May as well DVD, as 720p only on later seasons
I like the all
I like them all too

7Ziltoid: just try chrome
7Nah waiting for the D to get on

7the D to the C to the D
Aw
/me hugs back
A I B A
wat?
They're at 1.7 something now?
Yeah.
1.7 yeah
ducudu
7DCD dummies
Dari - imagine the indian guy ordering eggs
There's gonna be lots more in 1.8 though, 1.7 was just pistons
oh
funex?
Whats this funex business?
I still don't get how to use pistons.
Let's do something fun gais
Mind giving a link to a list of what's it going to include?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkWMcRlE1mQ
This, Ziltoid
Aren't the pistons supposed to be automatic block pushers?
well im off to hit the hay, 'night everypony
Let's do something fun, guys. Perhaps a multiway skype call?
I kind of stopped building stuff in Minecraft after I learned redstone stuff
7nighty
Hi Dari
something like that
goodnight
Goodnight Stripes
There's no complete list, and yes
Just wanted to play with different mechanics you can do with redstone dust after that
Night Stripes
I'm only sorta okay with redstone.
Oh
I thought pistons were supposed to LAUNCH you in the air.
i suck at redstone
Dammit.
L.O??
well
I'm amazed at what people can do with redstone
^
L.O. Ziltoid
Winter Wrap Up with note blocks.
I could do stuff with pistons, but... Creative block.
Hey Barry.
Working basic computers
I made a looping Parasprite Polka once
Cya stripes.
im confused
First built a password protected door, then made it that it works with a timed button sequence instead of switches, then made a security alarm, then made it to play small themes when pressing buttons and oh god who knows what
That was fun.
Combination lock doors are easy with repeaters.
7Whai confused?
Yeah
Sathi - what FUNEX was. Already helped hin out ;)
that video
The one I made after the switches just works with buttons
7cleaning keyboard... looks like the cat slept on top of it.
7a9dajdmfafasfadf
In ten seconds FLAT! :P
7iudsexr43657
lol. my keyboard is covered in hairs
lawl
(cat)
silly cow
7];L[PK0O90Y876E43AQwgfhjkl;'?
So after you press the first button, you have small amount of time to press the rest of the combination
Just unclick off the chatbar sathi >_<
Ooh, sounds tricky
Wow.
7I did but the fingerpointer still selects it :P
Yeah, took a hella lot of tries to get it to work
lais
I don't even know how to open a door properly using a lever with redstone.
Dammit, now I wanna play Minecraft
7all done
And the best part: after I was done with it, not too long after the server I built it on crashed and so the map was lost :U
Dari we gonna do something fun? or ...
Sure, give a minute.
Just doing something.
Sure
Since I play only multiplayer
I'll give you guys something for waiting.
Same.
7More spins?
most of us here have skype - we could sing? XD
Singleplayer has kinda lost it's luster to me, though 1.8 may change that.
If you all want.
the biggest flaw about making lockable doors is that unless the walls are made from obsidian, a person can just mine trhough it
i made a square wave generator using redstones
Also I made some harvesting system, that releases water so that it harvests wheat by a button press
there's instrumentals of all ponee songs, and we could sing otha stuff 2. I could record it too XD
...if anybody wants
Instead of going over the whole field picking it up
I mean, I hear RainBroDash wouldn't do it
Would've been easier to do with pistons, but I used some exploit some fellows had found
I do it by breaking a dirt block, but I stopped before pistons, so yeah.
Redstone: the silicon of Minecraft ;)
Reeds?
Yeah, I know it could have been as easy as that
But I just wanted to make it fancy
i spent three days building an elaborate rail system that crossed over 4 biomes
So... if a group of non-ponies from the equivalent of Tibet migrate to the equivalent of Japan and set up shop as an organized crime syndicate...
What would you call that?
*call them?

Ha, Verizon still hasn't come to my neighborhood and fixed the lines
The would, of course, be called YAK-uza.
ive never had a tv, just got one last year
150MPBS/35MPBS Now your playing with power, super power!
There's a voltage leak somewhere or something
really?
so went with an LED 1080 :D
And also, my internet costs quite a lot
and it wreacks havoc on my ping
But there's only one provider for this small town
I still have an old ass 20" sd tv
So I'm stuck with this connection (the best they can provide here), as well as have to pay those greedy horseapples
Meh, some big shot videogame magazines are throwing rumors around of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer Gear-of-war like
7my second screen is like 4 years old now
Welp, I'm not gonna be playing anything online for a while
Heh, nice
i just QOS everyone except myself
sure, if you can, get another 1080p one :D, but 1280x1024 isn't low >_<
1400 ping on the closest TF2 server... yeahno
ugh really dermathil?

Hey DesertRose, how do you block people from the ethernet ports?
But since I'm moving away from home to a student home or so maybe in a year or so, yeah
put tape over the copper parts
:D
7@dman

Yes?
Agreed, but only because of the time trial maps.
7we still need to finish that portal section sometime
Ha
I'd just have to login to my router and block their IPs
yeah Ziltoid.
Rumors of Co-op also.
Sorry, but my sister is a little more advanced then that
Sure do. I'd like to try again. L4D2, though, still runs at 5-10FPS

Race riots in the US in the 60s? Caused by GTA.
Netgear WGR614 v7
Fact.
ehh
Uh-huh... right, Pinkie
the media just wait until someone tells them about an evil game and they blame stuff on it until someone gives them a better example
Dari what you busy with aniway?
woot
And I;m the king of Siam
whatdothen
Not mine, but my old router could barely reach my room
I need to get a better router
I'm not actually making a serious claim, Barry. :P
My current buffalo doesn't support port forwarding very well
yeah, they always do that.
They did the same thing with comic books and movies when they were the new hsit
Though I wouldn't be surprised if someone blamed it on movies.
Hard to tell in writing
and evil rock music
I might set up some sorta livestream for spanish FiM episodes live :P
RobotPinkie, they did that back before games came around
@evilmeter Rock Music
6 Rock Music is 55% evil. (1379)
THIS IS MADNESS!
hahaha
what you can also do is change the wireless passkey
Yeah, they did it before movies, too.
@Pony The best Pony
6 The best Pony is 2The 8Wonder2bolts
Classical music has been blamed for all sorts of things, even.
Welp, I'm off to practise some BlazBlue
Today's best pony is the Wonderbolts
@POny today's worst pony

who here has working mics den?
mic works, but the hearing part of the mic is broke.
she conected wirelessly?
(headset mic works but headset "listening" part is broke0
7@Dari put something on :)
as in the part that hears your voice?
I have a working mic, but I'm not going to read aloud
http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb285/Kilappa/DSCN1560.jpg don't mind the derpiness. My camera derped at the time
oh headset broken : /
yeah
dermathil - can't ya go into audio options and make sound come outta your pc?
ITS BEATIFUL
though strangely the Mic part of the headset is working
Dman: I be using speakers
ya
/me 7hates IMVU...
is synchtube still down for you too?
Wait, is someone going to read clopfics over skype?
*BEAUTIFUL!
7Why did I ever install this piece of crap
She's the only wired one in the house
so plug in headset and set sound for speakers
but the headset are broken but the mic on it works
imvu IMVU is a 11+ 3D graphical instant messaging client developed by IMVU Inc. It hosts over 90.174 million registered users, and six million unique monthly visitors. It is in public beta, and has been available since April 2, 2004
(already did that for a while Dman)
Dermathil, then you can use your mic :D
unless the router won't let someone in and we're too lazy to restart the router
7tis crap
7uninstalling it takes ages..
yeah, but I got the lady that's cleaning the house right now
k
then we resort to the 100 or so foot long cable
90 billion registrations o0
so what. are. we gonna do then? I ain't just gonna sit here >_<
o.0
billion. million.
WTF
oh thats a dot
xD

http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112138-Kid-Snorts-Ritalin-to-Maintain-Marathon-Gaming-Session

why is my chat so derp
plz don't touch my tralala :(
no, Dman.
Don't.
yes dman
That's the kind of stuff only #silvershipper can do.
"i can't masturbate to this,﻿ to much girls, not enough Gunther" - top comment
and even then
...i'm getting mixed messages here
epic comment then
hahahaha
The latency on that cable must be something
so are we gonna sing? read a fanfic? chat? request vids? watch a show?
7up to Dari untill I hijack the stream
tralalalalalala
Dman, we be doing nothing.
but but
we could be doing stuff
I'm currently baffled at the stupidity of some people.
It's a desperation/laziness cable
I can figure
"A man wouldn't just sit here and do nothing!" Dermathil
Hardly anyone uses it, except for my mom
(brother bear)
Like the kids that snort ritalin since it is like a less powerful cocain.
who thinks that her laptops won't connect to the WiFi
and its cheaper
>mfw I was given ritalin as medicine when I was a kid
>mfw it acts just like coke
lol
Does it?
>mfw Coke mustn't be that bad if I took Ritalin at 5yo
tis a psychostimulant
(every morning)
trololo
Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is a psychostimulant drug approved for treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and narcolepsy.
soooo c'mon Dari let's do something
hehe
Well it contains amphetamine, or something, doesn't it?

A WHAAA
Synchtube plays youtube videos.
they're probably playing more ear-rape videos
Of course they will, they'll buy 50 million copies themselves and dump them in the Mojave
They want people to use Origin or to prevent the steam sales.
Nothing if Synchtube is down, Stephen
ha
lol wut?
xP
i heard origin deletes your account after 2 years of idling
exactly
total and utter BS
oh, and I hope EA sells Mass Effect 3 on Steam.
Wow, so you lose all games you've bought?
02Hiya beto~

AIM DOWN YOUR SIGHTS
Now I have to use my imagination to talk about ponies. It's tough.

Alright, taking out the TCP port that's connected to my sis's IP

/me has his fingers crossed as he hits the apply button
If you're behind a firewall you usually have to assign a specific port.
Unless you have port triggering.
I can see which ports are active in the UPnP tab of routerlogin
ok i have a request Dari: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/533001 Can you play this with commentary while you do so? (takes 5 10mins to complete)

TO EQD!
GIANT 3x3m LUNA
fine with me :V
DAT DERPY POSTER!
"Each evening many people from surrounding camps, or just passers-by would join us to watch ponies on the screen. We'd get visits from members of Karachan (polish 4chan clone), from a neighbor family with little children, from random punks not believing what they are watching and why are they liking it, rocker girls enchanted by magic, missing concerts to wat
watch ponies, and all kinds of Woodstock's colorful folklore just stopping by to watch ponies with us. Thanks to fan translation, the language was not a problem. So at about 5-7 episodes a day, with 4 last ones supplemented by fan-made pieces "Night of the Pony" and "PONIES the Anthology" ending the show we managed to air the whole season over the few evening
that's awesome
wow, that sounds epic
so a huge camping thing went down, and so many bronies were there
i guess
That just sounds like a good time in the making

If you experience tail stiffenings lasting longer than four hours, consult your physician immediately.
Amature writer = I MIGHT especially know what I am talking about when I say that the descriptive words on the packaging are an embarisment to the writing of the show (not to mention contradicting it, but that is another issue entirely).

Now, admittedly, there might be some safety concerns with making the carts large enough that they harniss to the torso/chest, rather than obviously being made to fit the legs, but... they should be able to figure something out.

Lunasta: go into your router's QoS settings and change the priority of bittorremt
Ronbodosh's ronbom
I don't get why they decided to make them black though
me neither
It dun have that in the settings Zeke
but don't mind it

Man, that sounds racist when I reread
What type of router? :@

9I think I still see the yellow tint
Haha

Yeah what
it sounds like Ford
dari - you can fully unlock perfect mane 6
Yep
9I'm not sure if it's just my brain
also ew that new Spy Kids
Fourd is how you'd spell it
don't know :(
Yeah >>
only the first is any good
NewDCD: I am afraid to tell you you may have to bring that screen of yours to a technician.
well then
might've been a hack, but you can play as mane 6
9because the TV in Channel Mode gives me correct colors
but either way this game's over right?
Spy kids was barely good in the first place
tell Henry Ford his name is spelled wrong
/me runs
the first Spy Kids was amazing
When a screen takes a certain tint in certain occasions it means it may or may not be close to die
Yeah, its pretty much done
the sequels sucked
so now what :P?
/me lately prodded?
oh
hi
Amazing? No .-.

12I say bull to any excuse on games/dvds/songs etc. There must be something wrong if you're going to blame your actions on a game when hundreds of people play it and not everyone goes and does that :/
but regardless I'm not saying video games are to blame, never will
I love Zelda and you don't see me trying to walk off into fields to find temples
as tempting as it is

Instant Rarity button? O_o
03$100 off holy crap
Yeah, this is supposed to be about GIANT ROBOTS
Also, Rainbow Dash is so many times cuter!'
GODDAMIT SRW OG!
03if I didn't already have Corel VideoStudio I'd so get it
hot pony lovin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYmZ0N2UZag
IF I WANTED TO WANK, I'D WATCH SOMETHING ELSE, NOT THE SHOW ABOUT GIANT ROBOTS!
Suddenly I want to build a giant robot and blow up china...
No hateing, just saying that since RD is so badass, her being cute is EXTRA cute!
yeah. They're giant alright...
03<Lakorv> sheesh. <- what was that comment at?
For the Ancient Chinese Mechs?
9well guys
lol
9at least they have the decency to keep most of the tantalizing shit in the credits
12o.o
That's true
03http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/memes-economy-update.jpg
I HAVE THE URGE TO GO BLOW UP CHINA USING A GIANT ROBOT
Atleast
9unlike HSOTD
WHY DO I HAVE THIS URGE!?
HSOTD was awesome but I agree, too much fanservice
9Existence: WHY YOUR URGE RELATE TO BLOWING UP CHINA AND NOT TO ENFORCING JUSTICE
at keygens and general silliness.
03how is it general silliness?
That video was... Disturbing...
9Rodman: I read the manga, cause the anime was too damn excessive
GO ENFORCE ENFORCER!
03Before I had a legal serial, I had to keygen it...
9at least it's easier to ignore in print
did I say it was?
BECAUSE ENFORCING DOESNT ALLOW YOU TO BLOW SHIT UP
It wud be much better with ponies ofc
Got a point there
12The trafford center is rioting now -w-
As for me
I'm leaving
03as Malwarebytes Anti-Malware is *THE* best antivirus for Windows, no questions asked
seriously?
12good god people.
Bye
Lati?
See y'alls laters
9awww
12yeah a friend of my mums
but seriously dcd, should I be rooting for the earth guys? because I really hate the dc people right now
Ofc!
Bai Rodman
later Rodman
OFC?
Bye Rodman
12just said
ofcourse
where did they read it?
Yeah NewDCD, which side is the "Good" side?
9obviously NOT the DC
9albeith the thing is
I have no idea who the dc people are or the earth guys. GIANT ROBOTS FUCK YEAH
oh
right
I'm not sure there is a good side
9the DC was more morally grey in the first game/season
6oh god my internet here fails
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
can someone link me to the just under 10 hour long vid of all the episodes?
yes
Thank you!!
/me glomps Sketchy_Sounds
9so they wiped out the DC and himself included, so the Earth Federation could be strong enough to fuck Alien shit up
9BECAUSE nobody believed him when he was like "GUYS ALIENS ARE GONNA COME FUCK OUR SHIT UP"
6its gonna take liek 12 hours to install this game lol
fav MLP Episode?
03inb4 TF2
6yep
12they're apprently around there o_o
03well at least you get 12 hours of sanity before that game
6I wanted it on this computer but if that's the speed it's going to install at
I hate MLP I just come here for the community
RobotPinkie No, but there is definitely a different shades of grey.
still, it seems like the only likeable/relatable characters are on the earth side
That's like asking me to pick a favourite limb.
6then forget it
...
03that's the spirit
/me hides
i agree sketchy
02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"
EARTH, FUCK YEAH!
^
>mfw I say that as Pinkie unzips her suit
03I love how Amazon emails me letting me know that I "bought" free apps on the Amazon app store
6you do know I already play the game, so I guess I'm already "insane" as you define it
/me knows what his favorite limb is
9spoiler: most of the relatable characters in the DC side will join the party. I mean, this IS SRW after all
03it's like, why are you even letting me know if it's free
Lolz
Cutest R-D! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVnu05eCX2U
the thumb?
what is that dont even
good, so I can hate DC then and not feel like a biggot :P
03well you're clearly addicted to it, insane or not
6addicted, no
6or else I'd actually let this game install
6and I'd be playing it nonstop
I MUST SATISFY MY URGE TO BLOW SHIT UP
anyonr?
03you basically do play it nonstop when you have it installed
