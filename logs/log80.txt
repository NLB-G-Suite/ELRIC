I'm kicking myself right now.

We should get Prison to come and talk on here some time, I bet that'd get lots of viewers.
pics?
9just that we gotta improve the audio a bit
Though I suppose there could be quite a few things that cause it
9what did Prison say?
Trixie on the other hand. I made up the idea that Trixie was actually an Amareican imigrant (one of the very few) and she had knowledge in enginering vehichles and such

Show a lot of clones in a lot of multi pony scenes

Running of the leaves is a good example
Lawl
Derpy is a pony of the highest tastes.
he isn'T as good as tennant tho
No.
HAHA
YES
Not as good, I still like him though.
In all honesty everypony does look the same.
yeah.
Eccelston is still awesome
And much prefer him to Smith.
yeah.
The only thing that seperates anyone is Colour and hairstyle.
Smith is crap compared to the others.
Oh and breed.
DAT ARM
Lawl
but body wise everypony looks the same.
she can'T hear
there's male and female too, and the 6(?) nonstandard body types
There are a few variation in head style and such, maybe even stature. But essentially
'armless
LAWL
Yeah
Granny smith
the bullies?
that was the last straw
after her departure EVERYTHING I liked was gone
But for the most part ponies all have the same body structure.

I was thinking Fluttershy=Summoner
i'm like a year behind on actual comics things
>idiotic
Ohh.
Lawl.
that's cool
Topshot i cookled some awesome pasta
I'd say Fluttershy is BST over Summoner
lol
nah Fluttershy would be the healer.
this running music is the best
Rarity has no magic other then gem finding
Well summoners are also healers alot of the time
Gas mask child?
Ahh.
Dancer has a lot of fashionish with them, you see it in their AF sets
She would be a mystic because her whining would cause staus effects
*Fa,o;oar

Those two episodes are Eccelston's best in my opinion.

Along with dragons

And whatever other characters we see in the future
sort of strange not to live in the country ruled by the two physical gods of the world
Lol, Mickey.
I still don't consider them gods.
12?
He likes to waste RAM :<
Neither do I
Comparitively, they are gods.
How strong do you think they are then?
If they were imortal gods they would not need gaurds
Just because "Oh Celestia" is a phrase, does not mean they are gods
And they're also immortal.
Lol

totally agree with Dari

I watched universe though.
it's a shame that season 8+ was just never the same
My other theary was that all pony ruled countries have an Alicorn.
I mean, we could prove whether the planet is the center of the universe or not
after they killed off [SPOILER] it just didn't feel right

I find it too hard to accept that the universe orbits around the planet
Locke, you made up more alicorns. That doesn't help, we need magical dragons and griffons or something
/me shrugs
Rams, totally
killerrabbit, they're probably not in a full sized universe slash past this point the show doesn't make any sense
Pandora's Moon
She's a Na'vi
Heh
Well the stars don't orbit around it. It is controleed.
There is an easy explanation to all of this.
er, no conservation of momentum*
All the lights in the sky ....aren't actually stars then
ITS FANTASY NOT SCIFI!
I don't care if it is scifi or fantasy, it is still fun to analyse things like this

Low light candid photography is my thing.

that reminds me of a FiM fanfic's tags...
I have a n00b tube

Extremely unbalanced gameplay.
I guess I've adapted to CoD and Halo's aim assist too much
It's sometimes easy
It doesn't have aim assist?
That's pretty cool.
/me neighs
They always burst into flames >_<
should I get a PS1 for $10
Yes it has none. I've heard people argue that it does (only a little bit) but from my experience it has NONE.
On a console, that's really weird.
Ayumi?
guys
(after months of not playing BFBC2)
Yes Vic
I would buy a SNES

SillyNilly that would be AWESOME
I lost about 5 lbs this summer. But I'm pretty skinny already and I need to exercise more than I need to loose weight.

are image boards considered forums?
/me adds Ponychan to favourites.
:O
rare!
you're not online are you dari?
eh, I prefer regular forums
yeah
meh.
having to post pictures everytime you want to start a topic is annoying
usually ponies like User_2640 join, stay a few seconds without saying anything, then leave the channel or quit with client quit

Maybe...
well do you WANT me to quit? :D
can always just post one of the million and a half random pinkie pie pics out there
no…
well yeah, but that isn't the point :P
Theyres a lot of pony threads on like every forum

While surfing the web i noticed the 3D ponies(even IRL) dont look as nearly as good as the 2D ones.
MrMooMoo, now thats an odd concept.
they have a hard shape to make 3d
/me laughs more
It's the shading 2640
/me would fly off in a huff, but…you know
Have you seen garrys mod ponies?
hmm you didn't show up? I reload

Spike: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I'm not really looking forward to the finished product as I am of the reaction to it
Neighter am I.
people can easily be attracted to the personalities and not the physical body
Oh my Luna. Did I just unintentionally make a pun?
Personification to a large degree
*hoofpump* AWESOME.
*or pawpump cuz I ain't got hooves*
Suddenly awkward in here....
…not really?…
But still. Fanart's making it increasingly hard to not be attracted to cartoon mini horses. <__>
Lycan: Me too!!!
/me bows graciously.
…okay, NOW it's awkward
Without the fanbase my favorite pony would of been fluttershy
I like fluttershy, but not in that kind of way ;)
Cuz she's basically me, as a girl. And as a pony. With magic.
/me silently drops out of the conversation
And knows a goddess personally.
Pft.
*yawn*

It's called prefrences. And I haz em.

Fanart made me like Twilight for some reason.
I like Tara too
All preferences are wrong.

Except for mine.
Then I don't want to be right. :3
It's ok, you are not.
twilight is my favorite... romantic interest of the ponies
/me is in the topic. She wins.

And Twilghts purple. I like purple.
Ha! Now I'm in the topic

I saw the cat woman episodes yesterday.
12XD
lolmiluna.
"Cat woman, you are not a nice person!"
OH NO
Said while hanging onto a plank over a pit of hungry tigers.
....
Do they not fear the reprocussions of such an act?
Considering they stuck Pinkie Pie and Megatron in the same song for something before, I think it's safe to assume they do not.

No, than taking the Batmobile somewhere. To be fair, I think where they were going was like quite difficult to get to by walking

I don't recall the exact reason they decided to run
Although it does lead to a hilarious sequence of them running in front of the sort of shot that would usually be used for driving.

it's how they find TST
also it should be /#Silverwings. Mind the #.
No, it's /Silverwings
/me curses.

/me nudges Shaico
How can it be /Silverwings when that doesn't define the channel type or distinguish between nicks?
http://lostinthecloud.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/faeries-aire.gif We were giggling over this.
Those were fantastic. I have not laughed that much in awhile.
but well, I should be off for now.

Because the last time I try /#Silverwings or such it put me into ##Silverwings

On the plus side, it meant when I got older I could at least understand bits of Rammstein songs when I heard them.

uh... hard to explain
The ony thing I got out of it was fahr, for travel of some sort.

Mucking around with this Disqus thing could be causing that.
How ruddy specific.

That's incredible XD
that's just ridiculous xD
whatcha wanna talk about, guys?
and i bet you can't look this up in a dictionary...
Is the name "Aoife" common outside of Ireland?
Not really
But yeah
Is it known?
That place in Wales is called Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
mook: you mean "Donaudamfschifffahrtskapitänskajüte" ?
I have been learning slowly how to draw ponies (FiM style)
wait i'll get it and look it up
Because i plan to draw myself..
that pony creator doesnt suit me as well
More drawing is good =)
Yes
Pppsshh.. That place name in wales is nothing
usually i have to give up
As long as you're not the worst
And hey, don't give up
oh apparently i was wrong... the word i mean was "Donau-Dampfschfifffahrsgesellschaft"
That's good @ Summer
Because thats my old user
and i dunno i had ping timeout on the other
I'm not sure if I'd be allowed to post the meaning of the name
...lol
It's dirty then

Random fact, Equestria is a real place
It's located somewhere in South Africa

Tiiiiiight.

"Friendship is Magic Bitch" you say? Yeah, seen it
Hillarious
TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
i dont like inkscape
But i had a sad :( Why Luna
id much rather have a vector plugin for gimp
TO-THE-MOON-CANNON FTW!
See I hate GIMP which is why I use Inkscape
But luna :(
Poor Luna :(
she just came back from the moon@
There's the pen tool in GIMP.
same, but i would like inkscape allot more if its layers tool was more friendly
Also, i guess it isn't really established, but I believe she has control over the Moon again
I NEED TO SEE HER in season 2
it's all pie in the sky until then though
Whilst GIMP may have a pen tool, it's still got the problem of it being GIMP ;p
Wait
If Luna has control of the moon again
Floods, anyone?
celestia - day sky. luna - night sky : D
Hmm, Luna could flood the place, freeze the earth, make night eternal
Celestia could ... make day eternal? Burn Equestria, bring about heatwaves
:P
Give them heatstrokes?
I like Gimp. Still learning Inkscape.
I tend to just use Inkscape for inking my lines currently, and then I just colour in SAI.
SAI?
Paint Tool SAI.
Sai is pretty cool
ok, brb. g2shower
It's an excellent colouring program IMO

I agree, actually.
Anyone ever feel a tingly sensatiom when they're going to sleep?
Like, honest even when it's hurtful to be
Hmmm?
Not me
Which I can relate to perfectly
OTOH, AJ's being a terrible liar works out nicely.
Like, a full-body one

That's how I do my criticism if I have something to say. Why avoid saying it directly?
Hahaha ye
**yes
g'day everypony
That definitely made sense.

The others are all pretty well assigned though
also Hawkie's, but ultimately mine.
Okay I'm stuck
I mean there's no way Pinkie would be anything other than Laughter

Same diff
hello GGgala
Exactly my thoughts Ludo :P
hows you?
alright you
not to bad thanks

whats hapening here in these early hrs?
Okay
Fluttershy is the element of Moe
moe?

Ooooh! I was just thinking about how Pinkie Pie's element and talent dovetail and make Pinkie Pie sense MAKE SENSE.
Definetely moe
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_%28slang%29
wow
Literally, it means "burning."
heh
/me grabs a camcorder
Or "budding" or "blossoming."
:D
To be more accurate, "moe moe" means burning.
Did that trixie post get deleted, or is it just me?
but yea i agree on fluttershy
I think it did, User_6654
kk, thanks
Seems like there could be a physical cause
And the streamer fell asleep with the computer on, apparently
I guess?
i suspect he did that on purpose, considering what's on
Ludovician: No, but it's not run see a psychologist abnormal. Within normal bounds-ish?

Trufax

Or, the way you put it sounded off
It's not normal in that it's uncommon. It's not abnormal in that it's not something to worry about.
yea
:p
or wait was that sarcastic
recording the perpetual spin :)
That's not it
Worth it...
I have all symptons
I only have one of those symptoms.
Three months back, I wouldn't be the same

I lay down, right?
Which one?
I close my eyes tight and focus on nothing but my eyelids
seeing ponies?
I start seeing swirls

/me catches it
my brother in law is learning an ocarina. it makes me giggle when i hear zelda songs.
I like FF just fine, I just haven't played much of the games xP
i play them with the flute *shrug*
To clarify, I mean
Did you mean this, salad? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-fleXlIRbs
I've always wanted an ocarina, but I settle for playing it on other instruments.
I have an ocarina :3
Three in fact
And yes I did
they are the best!
DO IT
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiutkHNiacE Though I prefer this version of the song
It's like an accordion.
lol
BetaMax was technically superior
But it lost out to VHS due to greater cost and other factors.
I'm old enough to remember tapes, but not 8 trakcs.
Hey there, Sathi
I'm older than Salad!
Wait.
That's... that's not something to celebrate.

Singleplayer has kinda lost it's luster to me, though 1.8 may change that.
If you all want.
i made a square wave generator using redstones
...if anybody wants
Instead of going over the whole field picking it up
Would've been easier to do with pistons, but I used some exploit some fellows had found
