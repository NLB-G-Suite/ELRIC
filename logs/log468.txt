10Most cities allow concealed carry
03the campus is just in the middle of the city
03so yeah
10Tch
I thought it was in Detro-
No. I would shoot hub.
03Flint
I mean, city
:>
10Detroit
03which is just as bad
hrm
O_O
10Just wondering
Because the college I want to go to is a section of a city
owo
03why, planning on doing some drive-by?
no?!
yes!!
:D
03then why's it matter :P
10Is it with most college and universities in the city, the city surrounding is usually bad? In terms of crimes and such
Because people might shoot me >.>
03well then
10That's how it is around here, and Kentucky o.o
03wear bulletproof armor
DONT PLAY IT
since the college I want to go to
like I said
is a SECTION OF A CITY
and eh
Huh
that crap's expensive
Whooooo!
I'll have tuition to worry about :/
10See my questionnn

<3
That's how wrong this show is.
/me hide
00,10track balls are great got cntrolling shields

03is a closed campus
/me flee
03and they have a huge section just for the school
I like Mudkipz :3
:3 <3
GUESS WHUT?
Rain: and the main gun is down bc of it
Guns are outlawed in the UK?!
10hm

UK, 100% yes
:D
FFFFFFFFFFFff
03yeah they are
WHY

03which is stupid
03>Bad guys don't follow laws
WHY IS THAT NOT HERE
my 14th :D
03>Cops can't have guns because of law
well eh
10Chimera
Actually DRF
O_O
10You're surprised?
I mean cops with guns
the cops here do have guns.
that makes sense
03yeah
10Guns are allowed in few countries
03but in the UK

well naturally. I mean, Jupiter is the second biggest bomb we have... and the Sun is NOT an option
11,01They built it around the planet Jupiter?
02I have no idea why they give you ink limits
00,10only 6 billion enemys
02wait, that wouldn't be why
It was the one that got me back into anime
take that Jupiter
that's a one bigass pill
Also, Sailor Moon was the very first anime I watched
hay RainBowJak
03KIK
03*LOL
03It's just because they're stupid
first anime i watched was Ranma 1/2
00,10now 8 billion
first mecha anime i watched was this Gunbuster...
It makes sense to measure velocity in terms of % of light speed
lol
But in terms of silliness, Ranma 1/2 doesn't hold a candle to One Piece
agred
"Do you believe in God?" "No, Captain." "Hmm. How about airlocks?"
no #@$%
02"Let’s make it like real old fashioned witting and give you an ink limit LOL. u mad?"

Wow, Buster Machine # 3 is beat up

i thought they had over 250L
K*
03yeah but really, 5 seconds?
03they should have just left it 10
00,10why are they hanging around for the implosion?
ruh roh
Studio Gainax is infamous for playing inappropriate songs for the mood
02I think it should be like 1 or 2 minutes
lol
11,01It broke.
Or something
it broke at 98% !?
STORY TIMING!
02that would be fair
00,10not to self put important componantes inside the armor
-_-
The miracle never happen
first officer sez "Told you so."
How dis they missed that?
lol
00,10but the pilons around the outside ahre the important part
02But then people might try to use it like a phone
http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/MLP_71e96f_2216427.jpg

It's just a matter of willing suspension of disbelief. I won't deny that it takes more than watching western content. But it's far more rewarding.

;
Hmllllll :3
yyahooo!!!
though Photoshop has nothing on the licenses for the software i use for work
$10000 for one
photoshop?
Drakeh
photochop.
IIRC, 3D modelling software costs more than Photoshop.
Photocop. It's sort of like Timecop.

Hello
you're getting ripped off XD
http://usa.autodesk.com/3ds-max/how-to-buy/
Oh, wait. I'm on the suites page.
Hi SL
But still, that's $3500.

00,02does it accept gif images or just tga?
00,023.5k
HA!
just takes time
...a LOT of time

Hello :3
I think you're about right
on it's own
:O
:O:O
do it
:O:O:O
of course then you couple 3DSMax with a Workstation + Renderfarm and you're looking WAY WAY more than photoshop
