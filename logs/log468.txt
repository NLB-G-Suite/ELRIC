HeavyScoot: you silly foal. We are geth..
10campus*
10Shut up LOL
XD
Wait
WHAT
03no they don't
THey allow guns in-
yeah good
10I thought they did
that'd be like
10You said something
the most retarded thing ever
/me Bleep bloop scratchy noises
03erm
03I said the dorms don't
03there's no such thing as "on campus"
/me and then Scoots was a geth
10I said campus
03our school is like two buildings
03dorm+academic building
03LOL
I had to mow the lawn....
10asdf then where can they have guns
10?
ekips: well i was watching something aboout tails doll and in one of the comments said this shit is more scary than polybius.. and i was like wtf is polybius and soo my research begun i started looking for photos i red all the interviews, played the game and i gt in a conclusion it was fake lol
03in public?
03like in the city
03walking around
03outside
And my mom is a perfectionist :|
10No duh
dat wall of text
DerpStar: Beep Boop Son, Beep Boop.
10Most cities allow concealed carry
03the campus is just in the middle of the city
03so yeah
If someone made a show that combined MLP FiM with something else that's horribly incompatible, would you just accept the new product as it's own thing?
10Tch
I thought it was in Detro-
No. I would shoot hub.
03Flint
I mean, city
:>
10Detroit
03which is just as bad
hrm
Kandarihu: like MLP and kid vs cat?
cuse kid vs cat sucks
Ohh I got it my cutie mark can be a cookie!
I wonder if Philidelphia allows guns
O_O
I like cookies
/me gives DerpStar cookie
10Just wondering
cachi01|writingessay: if it does, that's probably a great parallel.
Because the college I want to go to is a section of a city
owo
cachi01|writingessay, so the game actually exists, but the mentioned side-effect are only a legend?
03why, planning on doing some drive-by?
Yah well if its a crossover in which ponies win or at least stay in charter, its ok :0
no?!
TheRainbowDash: Type in /whois Gunthler and look at the first line for me. <3
yes!!
:D
Bye bronystate!
03then why's it matter :P
I have to say, Im impressed with The Hub. They give a ton of quality television shows. Not only My Little Pony, but like Aquabats and sturf =P
/me noms on cachi01|writingessay's cookie
Gunthler: Hmm?
ekips: OH HELL NAW THEY R REAL
10Is it with most college and universities in the city, the city surrounding is usually bad? In terms of crimes and such
Because people might shoot me >.>
bye BlazeAngel
SO DONT PLAY THE GAME
03well then
10That's how it is around here, and Kentucky o.o
03wear bulletproof armor
DONT PLAY IT
since the college I want to go to
Stormman3100: eeyup,and Dan Vs.
TheRainbowDash: Type /whois Gunthler
like I said
is a SECTION OF A CITY
and eh
Huh
and now for PONG IN SPACE!
that crap's expensive
Whooooo!
I'll have tuition to worry about :/
Mish: well they stay in character, then there's a timeskip and no more ponies. Because it's a different show entirely even though it has the same title.
Gunthler: Pinkie Pie?
10See my questionnn
I sense a great amount of sarcasm cachi01|writingessay
no
<3
That's how wrong this show is.
/me hide

Mish: What are your expectations with S3?
03same
cya Pinkies4thWall
FIRE FIRE EVERYWHERE
03I don't want to
What's playing?
Well....
bye Pinkies4thWall take care
Kandarihu: are you sating my initals or something else?
actually, what ARE everyone's expectations with S3?
More Derpy
Fireyum, balls!
AJIsBestPony: Robotech is
have fun Pinkies4thWall. I'm about to do the same
More Luna
I'd like to see A Derp in the Life become real. That'd be awesome.
Woodenfan_the_grovyl: not super high tbh, but more pony is good nonetheless
NOW i see what Kandarihu meant by dub tragedy
How long is this episode?
Somthing like having more minor charters interaction with the mane 6, and flushing out rainbow dash as a normal pony, not as a ego-maniac
you do know
Sumica: so, the Zentraedi pods are just robots?
some chemicals found in bull pee are in it
/me flee
lol she is playing super monkey ball
10lolmyths
Why Is Anime Is Taking Over?
00,10no, there is a pilot in each
Sumica: weird
chemicals != actualthing
Is there anyone here who actually likes Rainbow Dash? Everyone hates on her and it makes me sad :'(
:D
I like rainbow
RD is cool
dat exposition
Stormman3100: i like her but i think she is too mainstream
lol
pinkie pie is my fve pony
Here We Go Evrey Pony!
Sumica: is this macross?
CAPTAIN GLOBAL!
yay
the ORIGINAL badass captain
bye bye mars
My fave ponies are Fluttershy and Twilight
I just think she needs better flushing out as a normal charter. Her ego and actions make her a little unrealistic, and we need to see her as a normal mare somtimes
10!pokemon
Skylands, you are a 4Poliwrath.
Kind of like Korra....
Pinkies4thWall|Xbox: What's your GT?

I'd put up with Prince Blue Blood because I'd become a princess and I could meet Cadance

and then Orrick once again is the ONLY one that can do stuff

-lol- thats what you get for trying to be kool!
Randomnerd: who?
sweet, it's code lyoko
DerpStar: i heard blublood also means douche :D
Ingwaz: well im writing a paper for english composition, and what i hate about that class is that they teach publicity writing, the tyoe if writing to get people to read, not strong scientific paper
Cadence=Rythm
Ingwaz: Who's on First.
Why doesn't he just explain it again?
It just means of high birth superretroworld
All he has to do is stall the cops until he can return to the past.
>_>
I can change him!
Ingwaz: they say that if a claim is debatable then its good. imo thats ridiculous, if im going to make science thesis i want to be as full-proof as possible
aimbot >.>
So why not just admit it all?
THEY'RE MOOKS
twilight_sprinkler: hmm... i can do that type of writing, but normally i prefer analytical writing
CK|Ded: he is a kid and they re adults tht just want to destroy what they see.. u think they will hear him :D
And stall for time that way? Srs derp here, Jeremy.
OH GAWD!
Oh gawd
RAPE
twilight_sprinkler: well, science is science and english is english, english is not a science
Ingwaz: this is xalled analytical writing, they just want the claims to be debatable
so you can shoot while falling upside down. But you cant shoot while standing on two feet. Yeah that makes sense.
Ingwaz: and thats why i find english boring
11,01Another last-second save.

OH MAN

Let's do the time warp again!
English is definitely not a science....
twilight_sprinkler: but they want it to be expressive type of writing correct?
Lazors? Samurai? Yumi gets all the good shit!! :D

JEREMY. :|
The voice acting is horrible...

The writing in Friendship is Magic is so much better...
Lambo: eh, its not as bad as the original my little pony
twilight_sprinkler: ahh, sorry, i wasnt aware. its like you said earlier, publicity, to get people excited, not just facts and statistics
I thought CHICKS dig giant robots?
why are they the only one that remember what happened
Yes, a pair of cuffs on its feet would totally stop an animated suit of armor
>_>
:D
Dumb rock!
o3o

Not again :(
Legit.
He's just a city boy!

Aaaanyyywhereeee
SOUTH DETROTI
I always imagine John Dorian from Scrubs with this song
RUUUUN LIVE TO FLYYYYY FLYYY TO LIVEEEEE ACESS HIIIIIIIIIIIIIGH

Ingwaz: well yeah thats what they want. well actually they dont want it to be too emotional, more analytical, but at the same time debatable claims
I adore Philology, though.
oh wrong song.
The day that Anna died, this song was stuck in my head. The chorus just suits her.
damn wrong song

Don't stop believing!

twilight_sprinkler: language is a an uncertain thing. it really is not a science. so just because a writer might say something, they could mean something drastically different for many different reasons, part of english is exploring that

Language, at least the English language is more art than science. There is no such thing as perfect english, just proper.

Kandarihu: Technically, the only reason why proper english exists is so that it is more readable. It's like HUD design.
It's arrogant, but it doesn't change the fact that you can have an actual dictionary.

This is great for RD :D
its funny arrogance can be turned into such win vids
yep, that was weird
That was great. XD
Is it wrong that I REALLY don't like RD? I think she's too brash and too ready to start fights. She can really be mean and stuff.
twilight_sprinkler: i like some parts of science, but i'm not really the scientist type, at least not fully. I like to be very precise and explore things and figure out why they work and how to replicate those results. but i dunno, its just something i like to do for fun, as a sort of hobby
Wow
Randomnerd: More accurately, the have an academy devoted to making insanely clumsy words instead of just using a simple loanword. The Japanese are far more sensible about it.

i love this because all of the clever jokes
This song is great.
i hate it when people dont get pop culture references
all they need is to say "ungood"
;3
Ponies47, sims 3 was great untill EA rememberd to be EA and sell DLC for an illogical sum of money, also sims 3 has a no-snap mode and a free-rotate
its not meant to sound good or anything, but i intend to improve or make it later
11,01I never played the second or the third.
Monfang: Total War: Rome?

One Egg per Sentient Lifeform
o-o
08,01Sylandest: i have no idea. it's probably just an ulcer.
eww
Nittany_Discord: The second had very little new content, and the third was really good. The loading times were the biggest con in my opinion.

Ponies47, i remember when I used to buy a new sims expantion pack every month, Buck that
PFFT
Monfang: Call of Duty 2? Toy Soldiers?
HA-HA-HA-HA
I tryed to play Total War when it was about Japan. I'd take over half of the provences, get bored.
lupus shit thats worse
Ponies47, Althouhg it was usualy due to a lack of other games to buy
11,01It could be GERD (best-case).
08,01CupcakeWarrior: aye, usually just anti biotics

Bronystate WHY ARE YOU SO AWESOME!?! :O
hag bloody hell
Tassadork: guns don't work in space and no small scale lasers yet. Also, they are going for the simpliest weapons to be the most effect.
Ponies47: it's because it is run on wubs
NO......BAD BITCH!
they shud use lightsabers lawl
Do you REALLY need that translated? Even if it loses it's sense of elegance?
lol
They should be shooting eachother by now
Might and Magic. I enjoyed that game. But which version would you recommend?
DeathStar: I see.
13ping
in space, a pinhole prick in your spacesuit is as potentially fatal as a bullet through the gut
Ponies47: wait wernt you going to bed?
00,10and realy they are not translating it
that's what onee-sama means. "Honored big sister"
yay
Why arent they shooting eachother with lasers and stuff?
DeathStar: Yeah. I'm gonna stay for anthor 1/2 hour then bed :$
00,10yeah otakon that's the translation it's elder or big sister
otakon: but it's anime, who cares about realism =P
CupcakeWarrior: they aren't armed with weaponry like that, training bots

03so yeah
03help would be appreciated :/
Okay, HOW the hell are they withstanding that
otakon: Why are you questioning things in a gainax anime?
nope
problem is, radio also travels at light speed...
CupcakeWarrior: because this one has a BIT of realism in it
it's the Luxion
Paladin_Drakkenwolf: protip if you type in part of someones nic and press tab it outo compleats it and pings them

and then she went awol
00,106month SAR
2 DAYS!?
hasn't it been like 8 years for her?
00,101min = 3 months
minutes at high velocity are months at regular velocity...
time is funneh
Sumica: I know that, but still
11,01Gotta love time dilation.
How is 1 minute 3 months?
time dilation
CupcakeWarrior: going at the speed of light
That makes no sense
it's relativity
11,01How fast are they going? .9c?
CupcakeWarrior: it's a bit complicated
0,14when you're moving near the speed of light, time kinda goes wonky
00,10time slows down the faster you go
,998 c I think
well, he is surely dead

This is what I get for not paying attention to the first episode
stupid internet connection
derp?
HURRY HURRY!
00,10this has little to do with the first ep

00,10love this march theme
and the SHIP IS FINISHED!
lol
Rain: yeah I often find it anoying when people forget that
hen3ry: no, for them it's only been 10 minutes
well it was 10 minutes, therefore... 2 1/2 years
geeky-brony: lol I know, jurst so meny spelleeng airors
hen3ry: no, 1 minute=3 months normal time
although, the other ship was jetting too, so they were constiantly accelerating the entire time
all that misspelling
How many more episodes are there of this?
it's killing me
00,10Law of Constant Thrust, First Law of Anime Motion
00,10In space, constant thrust equals constant velocity.
otakon: and 4 min per year, so 10 min is 2.5 years
i know i suck at spilin words
therefore, 20 seconds=month

I'm scared of the ending to this show. Just saying
Nittany_Discord: no, that would NOT work

Ya'll heard of red shirts? Now we have brown suits. I promise you that by the end of the series, half of those pilots in the brown suits will be dead.

Monfang: they already lost 90% of the fleet
I'm being generous
/me 11,01is brown

"Oh no! I forgot to put on pants today."
hen3ry: wouldent the fish have earth weapons too? just fishyer earth weapons?
hen3ry: Dakka doesn't WORK IN SPACE

Ya.. I don't like these kinda anime. If I wanted to hear about people dieing, I'd watch the local news.

even though they're fighting a enemy that FAR superior to them
00,10epic march incoming
no wait, your head asplode
then dont watch it Monfang
00,10NANI!?
dat epic march
Hey
damnit, I'm planning my suicide here! Who's launching our superweapon?
I have an idea for an anime
there is NO way this thing is packing enough firepower to kill one of them.
suddenly Gunbuster
Aria the Animation
There should be a Bronystate anime
And its sequels
00,10bad ass pose
Wasn't the 'small fries' killing them?
0,14dat pose
Monfang: yeah
Monfang: by the truck load
CupcakeWarrior: ooh ohh can I die dramaticaly and make every one cry?
DeathStar: As long as your death scene involves dancing
Really, Aria the Animation should definitely be watched on here if only for people's reactions to that weird-looking cat
wow, it's HUGE
brought space sticks to a space fish fihgt
/me 11,01beams
CupcakeWarrior: done! :)
/me busters
Polydunami, I am GabeMoist and I approve this message
Tassadork: the smaller busters do NOT HAVE BEAM WEAPONRY, they don't have the battery capacity for it
so put 40,000 of those on your warships, instead of those useless huge ass cannons
/me busts some guns
04<CupcakeWarrior> There should be a Bronystate anime <-- Only if I can be involved for absolutely no reason, no bearing on the main plot at all
hen3ry: it's experimental tech that isn't full proof
00,10Ghosties would have a music bit
I'm glad SOMEPONY knows what I'm talking about :3
Ghosties: so like chat is normaly?
04I could be hiding behind a curtain or something
otakon: it works better than what they've got
Ghosties, you ARE the curtain
in the mean time - cancel ALL the laws of physics
hen3ry: it's the ONLY ONE MADE SO FAR
I'm sorry, it's still hilarious! space sticks. sticks. in space! after the super robot wars stream its kind of refreshing
Well, Noriko is dead now too
Snuck on score
:3
04I'd be great for non sequiturs :D
11,01I would be such a good maid in the show.
00,10gunbuster is in Super robot wars
Ghosts come on at night? O_O
Sumica: wasn't it already done?
Nittany_Discord: animes love maids
04We only come out at night~
Every time Nittany explodes, there should be sad music
I spoiled myself on the ending to this anime :S
04And during the day if there are tacos around

/me dances to happy misic
does that mean you are from the ghost zone thu?
00,10much more fitting ending theme
WAit, I thought she died?
nope
better twist. Kill off title-technology in 4th episode. Still have 22 to make.
Where did the giant robot come from?
also, the show isnt over yet...
Seriously, Gunbuster is damn near the size of one of the smaller ships
Weeeeeeeeeeellll?
CupcakeWarrior: the Excellion
</3
CupcakeWarrior: they built it in space
00,10hatch number 7 did't you see when they said it was opening
Wait, is that the Gunbuster?
11,01Robot hugs!
88%+ of the fleet is gone, our super weapon is broke, and the aliens almost discovered the earth. happy music!
I think i broke ghostie
set phasers to hug
:"D
Midnight_Tempest: damn near should be
04Nope
Wait. Is this the last episode?

I'm running away
/me pours spector oil on a sword.
Ghosties, how well would you do in Luigi's Mansion?
04Bye JRP
Bye bye
0,14well, guys, 'm off to bed
11,01Also, aliens are eating their sun.
otakon: if you saw Diebuster then you know that that wasnt the end... there is a much bigger battle later on
Polydunami: Ive heard that show is creepy
04Have a good night, JRP
0,14good night and enjoy the stream!
Goodnight SaxyPretender :)
Bai JRP and Saxy
Night Saxy
00,10not gonna stay for the end SaxyPretender?
04Have a good night, Saxy
11,01Have a Saxy's night sleep SaxyPretender
Midnight_Tempest: I know, but Diebuster is more anime-y if that's a term than Gunbuster is by far.
bye SaxyPretender take care
0,14I'd love to stay, but it's 2 AM, and if dad wakes up, I'm doomed ;___;
11,01Bye JRP
bye JRP!
00,10ah oki, sleep well SaxyPretender
As soon as Kongou Banchou comes out as an anime, we should watch it.
otakon: it was more along the lines of current anime, yes... but Diebuster was one of the first Mecha anime i watched and i wish more was like it...
Anyway, yeah, School Days' last episode was actually cancelled in Japan because of similarities to real life news
03god dang, they don't even give me enough ink to write a letter
otakon: Gunbuster, sorry
0,14thanks for streaming this though, been wanting to see it
And that's why we have Nice Boat
Polydunami: So there is no ending?
Polydunami, Nice boat...
Polydunami: Nice boat? Whats that?
awwwwwww
/me 11,01is yellow
Polydunami, that was one of the first animes I watched
/me is turqoise
name of this?
DREEEEAM WEAVER
It was horrible
Midnight_Tempest: you mean more scientifically sound and less gibberish?
11,01Cheerilee's a whore.
It's a meme: they replaced the last episode of School Days with footage of nature and stuff
Nittany_Discord: she is NOT
And boats
One part of the footage was a boat
Yeah
footage of nice boats
Polydunami: Is there an actual last episode
/me slaps Nittany_Discord around a bit with a large trout
There is
CupcakeWarrior, yes
04How dare you talk about Cheerilee like that! :O
/me polkas
that ytp has destroyed hearts and whooves for good
otakon: yeah, more realistic and scientifically plausible
Polydunami: oh yeah, the whole "Show nature" when something is particularily ciolent
11,01otakon and Ghosties: But Sweetie Belle said so herself.
04Have you no manners?
Yep
Nittany_Discord: SHE DID NOT
Nittany_Discord: and there was even a picture!
/me agrees with Nittany_Discord
04Sweetie Belle is just a kid :I
Weird Al sounds better than Lady Gaga
and a robot
otakon: It was from a ytp
04She doesn't know what she's talking about :I
CupcakeWarrior: I know.....
11,01I like Cheerilee, but I heard it from Sweetie Belle. She had a pic.
anyway, I'm off to bed myself as well
Cheerilee is a womanizer
the manliest brony guy must hate that ytp
it's 2: 28 AM now
Night otakun
I wonder if there's a link to this video...?
Nittany_Discord: The storm is getting closer and I'm scared. I'm starting to hear the thunder roar.
Wait, where does Blueblood's clothing start and where does it end?
Nittany_Discord: pics or it didnt happen right?
00,10yeah there is Polydunami, but I dont have it
and the only real reason I was saying up is bc my sister had to go to the hospital and I was saying up for updates. A fever at 8 months pregnant is not good.
I'd like to figure out what song this is and favourite it
dat Baby
There was supposed to be a storm tonight, but there wasn't even rain, only a long power outage
Is it actually called Polka Face?

damn thats made by the same artist as this anime
otakon: BZZZZZT! But thanks for playing. Before Evangelion, almost EVERY Space/Mecha anime had at least ONE person who was either dying or doomed to die. And you could tell who it waws early on. Although everyone acted surprised.
RainBowJack: not that one! It's got pretty art and tbh the best anime boobs ever concieved but dammit all it's so short.
dishwasher_EXTREME: Lol
llllllludicrous speed
Nittany_Discord, not in Legend of Koizumi (Well the manga version at least)
RainBowJack: Gainax didn't do Plastic Little.

its not a shipwreck, the ship was sent empty as a bomb
kill dem kill dem alll
Nittany_Discord: however, they need it to go critical so it makes a black hole to suck in the enemy fleet
uhhh worst motivational speech ever

good news. has built ultimate weapon. Better news - built it fast. Bad news - can't build any more. Worse news - pilots are drama queens.
inplosion
lots
pretty sure that was a bad idea
there was no one on the ship...
that ship created a supernova
CupcakeWarrior: at was launched out there as a bomb asn escorted
ah
at the low low price of creating a black hole near sol system
11,01Looks like they killed a galaxy.
Tassadork: it'll stabilize
hehe this would be hilarious if that was in luna's hair
lol
there is still more... the show ends even more epically than this...
just casually
ship exit is in the hand
HE'S STILL ALIVE!
00,10the hard headeed bastared refused to die
Midnight_Tempest: okay, HOW?

HUZZAH
It's like a proto Gurren Lagaan-- with more legs.
Sumica: There is still 1 more episode right?
Is this a dream?

the entrance hatch is in the HAND??
He survived space-cancer with the power of love.
otakon: cause it has to tie into Diebuster...
00,10yep one more ep

bathrope
Kencolt: and more nudity
he's earned an eyepatch

Polydunami: well it was really good for a fan one
11,01DANCQ?
/me dances
QWOP
Do the G-A-B-E-N
SirGanjalf : yes GunBuster was made in the 80 just like Akira was made in the 80 but released in 88 8 years of defelepment
Sumica: Did you take a peek at the videos I linked you? =3
also, I'm digging this PMV
QWOP
otakon, it had me fooled too
otakon yes we know Rina-chan is good and all
00,10Probably not
I've never heard this song before
but it's interesting lol

Awwww.

RainBowJack: 8 years in development, huh?

00,10B.E.A.T

this theme sounds familiar
cute i ment
CupcakeWarrior finally"
finally?*
Actually, I don't really care
the lyranic
Lyra x Bonbon is the only ship which i may consider
who is unhappy looking pony?
Sibsy
00,10the one with Sibsy kinda looks like mine but with a horn
Is it my imagination-- or does Pinkie look like she has an afro in this vid?
hay MahBoi777 what kind of pony r u
Shipping is not my area of expertise
lol 15?
I still prefer Techno Scootaloo
15 years later... still no finished second gunbuster?
THE SNOW
Kencolt: Yes she does - cause that's one funky video!
and yes, final episode is in black and white
00,10he ded
:(
oh he dead
Commander?
She's aged well.
wait......THAT'S RED
Dammit, I hate black and white scenes
he dead hard!.....wink wink
00,10yes that's red
You're aging slower in space, from what i've heard
SirGanjalf: eeyup
lets have a moment to honor weird bathrope guy
wait.......WHY are they talking about Noriko like that
FAN GIRLS!!!
geeky-brony: hmmmm?
11,01Coach is a girl!
Because they will never see her again
hmmmmmmmmmmmm
Oh, Noriko is in space
but their grandkids will
kickass anime
geeky-brony: cud u please repeat that, my chat derped on me lol
did anyone figured the song in that previous video?
Where is the colors?
wow, short series but good
CupcakeWarrior: there are none
there are no colors
not enough budget for color this time
the episode is in black and white
i just love Little Snow Fairy Sugar
deal with it
Well thats a bunch of bull*yay*
00,10gondola ride in to space
wait WHAT?!
MahBoi777 what kind of pony are u
thats a long cable car
She's wearing a PROPER military uniform. (Wonder how long that lasts?"
The epic final battle has no colors? Thats stupid
cause I can say it's from Haruhi Suzumiya
ahah that's awesome. dinky space elevator
11,01Australia is best stralia.
"screw Australia"
THE LOSS OF THREE PLANETS?!
00,10not sure why black and white
What a ripoff
only lost three planets
geeky-brony: http://derpy.me/hO6Sw :P
no one needed those planets
I mean, seriously, Uranus?
no one misses it
sumi is best sumi
space gondola? reminds me of half-life somehow
they did it in black and white to signify the importance of the episode...
00,10I dont think my player can do no color
oh thats remind lost planet 3 is coming out yay
11,01Wow. Kill a galaxy to save a planet.
lol MahBoi777 im a unicorn
00,10buster machine number 3
ah 3 planets gone ah what ever
Nittany_Discord: not even that, it's like burning a forest to save a ant.
11,01But the thing is, our galaxy already has a black hole at it's center.
geeky-brony: Lol I see
Ok. 15 years later... one new buster built
3 planets gone but nowhere near earth...
is this a memory? because its black and white
and they finished eltreum too
good job guys
MahBoi777 yups
I hate black and white, its not near as awesome as color
and NOW everything got more hi tech
You know, black and white ain't that bad,,I kinda like it.
and ofc the old man STILL looks the same
00,10oh there is Red
Apparently, after 15 years-- skirts are still not an option.
wait...RED?!
you people are really bad at following shows...
that WASN'T Red on Earth
00,10keep in mind they spent 15 earth years on this ship
There were skirts on this show
otakon: It's the "Sean Connery effect"
Midnight_Tempest: IT's hard to tell dammit in black and white
otakon: no, it isnt
voltron
Midnight_Tempest: it is for me, so buck off.
I think Im just going to call the previous episode the last one, considering that would be a valid ending
Not when piloting.
and still the same sexy suit
00,10going to pause stream real fast.
k
otakon: sucks to be you... i understood this show when i saw it as a kid, and i was 8...
Righto
Midnight_Tempest: buck off, it's 3 am
SO MANY COLORS
11,02CODES :D
hiya SuperBrony64
otakon: then go to bed you foal...
SuperBrony64!
ohai SB64
/me 11,01codes SuperBrony64
/me hugs SuperBrony64
Buf- oh. NM
Midnight_Tempest: I WANT TO SEE THE ENDING DAMMIT
SuperBrony64
CODEBREAKER
11,02NH9KEPXN9TNY
otakon: EVERYTHING GOES BOOM!
Hai :3
hay SuperBorny64 is on
I was expecting an epic final episode, but all I get is black and white crap
/me hugs RainBowJack back
Now, children... do I have to pull the stream over for a time out?
SB64 that looks almost Russian
00,10it's supposed to be in black and white
11,02Enter the code in iTunes for fun :3
00,10dat warp out
11,02Only one can redeem it though o__o
CupcakeWarrior: maybe it's so epic, it's made u colorblind
CupcakeWarrior: if you dont like it... dont watch it... seriously... ive been saying its supposed to be like this, but no... no one listens to me...
11,01Their budget ran dry, so they had to drop color.
Its hard for me to follow stuff in black and white
wat
Nittany_Discord: lol
Don't have iTunes
Nittany_Discord: That's what i thought in first place, lol
i like black and white anima i can ues my IMANGATION mor
Oh crap, its midnight
it's a bomb the SIZE OF A PLANET
bigger than planet.
its not hard to follow anything in black and white...
I guess I should get to bed XD
holy shet
woah here the giant orbital chicken egg
well yeah, BIGGER then a planet
gnight CupcakeWarrior!
00,10seems it was supposed to be in black in white to give it an arttistic feal
so they destroyed three planets, and probably had to break down a fourth just to get enough raw materials to build it
Yeah, Amano has ged a bit
good thing they had 9 planets when they did this series.
who dafuq is this lady
hen3ry: hell, that's probably what they were talking abou in destroying planets
night CupcakeWarrior
Yeah. Gainax didn't really run out of money until 2 episodes from the end of Evangelion TV
00,10the lady is "big sister"
is what just ran through that girls head
dshannon: it's Amano
Sumica: Yes. an obvious artistic choice. Part of Gainax's desire to break the norm.
02then why ew swapnote? XD
02although it does have it's problems
02its*
bye guys skyrim time
bye dishwasher_EXTREME
later dishwasher_EXTREME
bye dishwasher_EXTREME
dat foreshadow
ciao dishy
11,01Do some extreme diswashing dishwasher_EXTREME
11,01!
wilco
by dishwashe_EXTREM fus ro dah
wow, that's a LOT more realisitc then the original video frame
EXTREME lol
Kencolt: it was because of this that i really began enjoying anime that were similar to this... it was so well done
00,10oh right juipter is in the middle of unit 3
ok
jupiters core is the core of the bomb
space dolphin
Sumica: I call bullshit on 15 years. :P
well naturally. I mean, Jupiter is the second biggest bomb we have... and the Sun is NOT an option
11,01They built it around the planet Jupiter?
02I have no idea why they give you ink limits
Vordox: traveling at lightspeed will do that
yet we still use huge useless laser cannons
02to save space on their servers I guess
Nittany_Discord: they USED Jupiter to build it
Kencolt, that was the same for me
11,01They really like screwing up the solar system.
00,10only 6 billion enemys
02wait, that wouldn't be why
It was the one that got me back into anime
take that Jupiter
Sumica: ONLY!?
o3o
Kencolt: yeah, i liked Sailor Moon too... it was silly
that's a one bigass pill
Also, Sailor Moon was the very first anime I watched
02would take up just as much space no matter how much ink you used XD
hay RainBowJak
03KIK
03*LOL
03It's just because they're stupid
A;though the first anime I ever saw was the original AstroBoy when it first showed on CBS. Or NBC-- I forget which, yeah, I'm that old.
Actually, my sister watched it and my mother disapproved
first anime i watched was Ranma 1/2
00,10now 8 billion
Ranma 1/2 gets all kinds of silly
first mecha anime i watched was this Gunbuster...
It makes sense to measure velocity in terms of % of light speed
so you athiest can gtfo off of my ship!
lol
But in terms of silliness, Ranma 1/2 doesn't hold a candle to One Piece
agred
"Do you believe in God?" "No, Captain." "Hmm. How about airlocks?"
Technically, the first anime I watched was the dub of Go Lion. But I didn't get into anime until I saw the dub of Sailor Moon.
no #@$%
how cud they NOT notice it?
Well, the Space Monsters aren't stupid are they
02"Let’s make it like real old fashioned witting and give you an ink limit LOL. u mad?"
/me has never seen Sailor Moon
Pinkies4thWall, try it out
YES!
hay MahBoi777 what was the first anima u wached
crap
is that a planetsized bomb?
WHY ARE THEY NOT DIEING?!
02must be what they were thinking
geeky-brony: Dragonball Z
dat +k
00,10montage!
Dark_Horst: eeyup
same here to MahBoi777
I am hearing Hallelujah Chorus
d.....did they win?
not yet
MahBoi777: no idea yet
02Swapnote recordings limit would be to save server space however
murder
/me dances back into chat
OK. Sense just flew OUT the window.
/me walks into chat
00,10Just?
What else is new?
hiya DeathStar you are JUST in time for the ending of Gunbuster
.-.
otakon: yay?
pfft... this montage was awesome...
DeathStar: yes yay
wb DeathStar, how was DINNER? :P
most inappropriate songs ever
/me jumps on DeathStar and giv big hug
Wow, Buster Machine # 3 is beat up
MahBoi777: corn beefy and mashpotato filled
Wait, Sumica how many ships did they have before?
mmmmmmm
/me hugs geeky-brony back
yay
I may be wrong, but i think that was the part that saved some budget
00,108000 or so
otakon: almost aes many as you used to hav
i thought they had over 250L
K*
Sumica: well, it went better then the first real fight
03yeah but really, 5 seconds?
03they should have just left it 10
00,10why are they hanging around for the implosion?
damn windows 95
ruh roh
Studio Gainax is infamous for playing inappropriate songs for the mood
02I think it should be like 1 or 2 minutes
wait WHAT?!
lol
11,01It broke.
Sumica: because imposions are cool
Or something
it broke at 98% !?
STORY TIMING!
02that would be fair
00,10not to self put important componantes inside the armor
don wanna miss that awesome implosion
-_-
The miracle never happen
first officer sez "Told you so."
How dis they missed that?
Sumica: they DID, did you see how banged up it is?
true MahBoi777
lol
00,10but the pilons around the outside ahre the important part
o rly? they lose 5500 ships and guy is bothered about one more life?
02But then people might try to use it like a phone
Tassadork: and the most powerful weapon they have that isn't disposable
http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/MLP_71e96f_2216427.jpg
not the life. That ship. The busters are the only things they have that work
11,01It's the protagonist, though.
03so what?
And how long will it be until we ponies in gunbuster uniforms?
03why limit the abilities of something you own?
Oh god
they built the bomb around jupiter??
i have to go bye bye everypony
He left
12 BILLION!?
I probably should not have said that when Wrek is around.
by RaniBowJack
00,1014 attack waves later enemy is now 14 billion
bye Rainb..........dammit he left
/me hugs RaniBowJack
Wrek is asleep as far as I know
Jupiter transformed into giant space pillO:

"lets make out, onee-sama"
NOW KISS
hi Mutterguy
Noriko said something familiar

hey Mutterguy
Mutterguy: when?
Midnight_Tempest: they are ACTIVATING A PLANET SIZED BLACK HOLE BOMB FROM THE INSIDE
Noriko said Shizuka
hay Mutterguy
00,10topless time
I think bronystate must be traveling at a really high speed because i spend a few minuets on here and then I look up and hours have past
otakon: yeah. and? Diebuster....
13ping
pong
haha
Welll... supposedly september right... that'sSpring

DeathStar: lol ikr

She really meant "Quiet"
I RECOGNIZED THAT SCENE!

oh lol.
shizuka is the japanese word for quiet
Entrust me with your life and my boobs.
boob....
i'm okay with this!
13yes
THE MORE YOU KNOW
DAT SYMBOLISM!
I thought I said that?
Vordox: BEST symbolism
ka boom
11,01And she had to rip her heart out to do that. =p
Polydunami, and I said it too
now kick back and watch teh fireworks lol
Oh yeah xD
:|
or should i say BREAST symbolism? *rimshot*
I feel awkward
dammit
lol why
Sumica: isn't that the same kind of motion the one girl made in Diebuster?
Get away from the impending blackhole
00,10yeah
02although it does have its limits
Woosh
02Nintedno might never meet them
Sumica: I thought as much
ka boom
02Nintendo*
03derp :P
00,10might have to marathon diebuster here soon
wow, that scene made me a bit melancholic
Sumica: :)
Well, there goes the galaxy.
diebuster?
11,01One huge black hole.
wtf
whoa
That's right
you know...
Dark_Horst: Gunbuster sequel
00,10Sequeal to this
they were at event horizon
A black hole is a weird thing atm...
Twelve Thousand years
Sooooooooooooooooo...Wh knows, they maybe sur...
OH LOOK
wow, it made it
00,1012000 years later
the fuq
i think i remember that melody...
Ok. Was that a fish tree?
Or rather, over 9000 years later
damn...
wowo
02I do have to say though
11,01And it's destroyed?
WHADAFUQ
the apes have taken over
Sumica: so, how long were they traveling?
^
lol
how the hell dos the robot know the time outside of the singularity?
oh fuq u lady
02Nintendo has gone a bit further then they normaly do
the APES of course!
00,10aroind 5 min
NO!! OLE YELLER!!! PLEASE DON'T GO!!!!
then suddenly LIGHTS!!!
Sumica: okya
Welcome home!
WUT
wowo
02normally*
:)
Okay, close enough
wat
ofcourse they built a city to say hi
00,1012k years on earth, almost no time to them
"we wrote it in ancient japanese"
Okaerinasai
daaaaaaaaaawwwwwwww <3
02like apps that really are good
then color
02unlike a lot of the wii's apps
yep because all other forms of entertainment have run thier course
Wait, they still used Japanese!?
800 hours to them. I just crunched those numbers.
Damn, I can't believe they remembered them after 12K years
Sumica: So...they are 12000 years dumber? :P
how nice
:)
I bet they STILL haven't built another gunbuster
11,01Did the fix global warming? =p
Midnight_Tempest: SYMBOLISM!
otakon: ikr
02and demos
Nittany_Discord: if not, RAEG
03name like, two
/me runs
Tassadork: They don't need to now.
And they didn't even think to travel to where they were?
Nittany_Discord: THEY COULD TRAVEL ACROSS THE GALAXY, I think so.
well that was awesome
Or wait, that would mean more time screwing
i like how Diebuster also ends with those two coming back...
00,10yeah they moved earth further from the sun in diebuster
Polydunami: the Black Hole caused a HUGE time dilation gap
6I'm with drf on this one lol...
DAMMIT
indeed geeky-brony
/me starts dancing like a idot
they built a CITY! to say HI!!!
12,000 years ago, humanity had yet to acquire basic civilization. 12k years later...
02well, swamnote is one of them, even though they went insane on limits
02swapnote*
City hell. The built a PLANET.
hen3ry: we be cruising the Galaxy
wait, why did noone go out to get them half way?
11,01Why move the Earth?
Samsa: no idea
Humanity is underrated and overrated at the same time
of course, in 12k years, you'd think they'd have... developed FTL and rescued em
03that's about the only one
03is swapnote
Kencolt: huh you called?
04HUMANS
03everything else is the same shovelware DSi had
00,10You will see when i show Die buster
Where!?
Nittany_Discord: to keep it from getting sucked into the black hole.
03in fact, go to the 3DS store, go to new apps, it's like DSiware
03everywhere
04I must leave you for a wee bit so my computer can cool down
ok
11,01Doesn't make sense.
02they do have really good demos :P
hen3ry: they DID have that, but they don't even KNOW if they survived.
04So see you guys until later
6what /is/ swapnote
Ghosties :3
in Diebuster humans couldnt leave the Sol System cause of what that black hole did
Seeya
later Ghosties
bye Ghosties take care!
by
See you Ghosties ;)
03it's like pictochat but you can send to people over wi-fi
04Later
03or rather, what pictochat should have been
Ghosties
11,01But, heck, a black hole eating the galaxy's core doesn't since a super-massive one exists already.
^

The issue is, just noone can draw my hair as Pony. D:
Vordox: u should see mine lawl
all requests on PM please :)
Vordox: what dose your hair look like?
As Pony?
From straight ahead it looks like...
yesh
http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/672/75265797.png
From the sides it looks WAY harder. XD
not much
xD
yea Vordox
Vordox: it's not that bad
DeathStar: You'll see once I make myself as a Desktop Pony. XD
nice Vordox
It's a quickie sprite of him
Sprite artists<--
Vordox: oh noes
hrhr
But yeah, he has a rather weird hairstyle that's rather feminine. D:
VioletGreySha: your OC drawings are very good
Vordox: lol
thx MahBoi777
my OC has rather feminine eyes
If you need specific critic, VioletGreySha , Just link one of your images here you want critic and we'll give it to you publically. =3
:)
LOL mario_pony
my OC is a girl
i got 2 OCs hrhr
my has long hair
DeathStar: :O No. F-ing. Way
i have 2 aswell
and there fore is rather feminine
mario_pony: ikr?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: butr yours are both male
I haz an Afro
VioletGreySha: with femaleish hair
yah
i has afro irl
kinda small
me too
mine's pretty big lol
but still considered an afro
mario_pony: /)
(\
VioletGreySha: is that a mare?
yah but its picture for a comic
nice
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: can i see a picture of your OC?
please
VioletGreySha: Want a critical eye on it? =3
do what ever you like xD
VioletGreySha: Wait, is this a coop work with Wrek?
not really
He's drawing somethin similiar
Alright, CRITICAL EYE ACTIVATE
ooohh
Candy!
looks like candy
bitches love candy lawl
i guess many people draw something simular sow
Bitches love giant robots
lol
The snout is a bit skewed, it looks to be somewhat of too long down on the face compared to the circular face, The arms aren't as stubby ast the show itself, the joints of the forelegs are too bendy to be compared to the real ponies..
Let's see....
Good points
Vordox: which pic?
wow that is a long horn
whoa
i like long horns
XD
Vordox: lol who cares about those things
lol VioletGreySha
12._.
hmmmmm
i don't get it .-.
The legs are a wonderful piece of art, The hoofs, although abit too small as the arms, keeps their volume as they bend and it looks quite nice, The cold steeled weapon actually has a nice colour balance with design choices to not stick out from the pony.
Phew
CRITICAL EYE INACTIVATE
somepony explain it to me
SO MUCH ART TALK
/me pokes Vordox u iz so siri
I am a serious person.
off to the tv
/me is now afk
VioletGreySha: Otherwise. a 7/10 =3
Vordox: well it was a drawing i made without a tablett so its kinda not soo good like my newer ones XD
lol bai
WITHOUT A TABLET?!
9.5/10
XD
trust me..
i really wish somepony would draw my OC :/
I'm not a tablet person myself :P
I know the pain

night DeathStar wub u
night DeathStar
To be honest
tbh no offens to wrek but i dont like the long hooves
Even Wrek himself doesn't get a 9/10 of my rating. <.<
So far, atleast.
/me dances out of chat "see you tomorrow"
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: It's his stylistcal choice he settled into
ikno
Accept what he wants to o unique, an se how far he can take it
/me is DEFS afk now
VioletGreySha: I know that, but your style is rather hominous to the show, right? :)
i try to stick on it but not on all points
like wings and stuff
02;3
What do you wish for style?
Oh, I haven't seen any of your wings yet
I think I'm gonna go to bed too, but before I do, here's mah OC. http://derpy.me/hO6Sw

VioletGreySha: would you draw my OC?

mario_pony: PM me with details and then yah :3
night MahBoi777
VioletGreySha: So what's the unique part off the wings-
its not mlp style
XD
from teh show
Really?
They aren't as fleshy, but that's all I can see, something more speific?
02what are you drawing?
http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg78/evalana/blog%202/mlpfim_ep1616.png
Well there is some variations.
yah
hai guys

Morning Dashie. Sleep well?
Yeah.....just got finals today.
Oh :o
Well good luck then ^_^
Yeah, best of luck to me then...
Ghosties: Got any amazing advice to help TheRainbowDash during finals? :3
XAX: My only tip for myself....don't fuck up.
True...
04Advice?
04Hmm
04Make sure she gets creative when she studies
04Or he
04Or it
Hi TheRainbowDash
Hello RainbowAsh!
Ghosties: Or it?.....hmm.
04If TRD is an "it" then why in the world you are studying for finals, you shouldn't even be sentient
TheRainbowDash, good luck with your finals. I am sure you're going to do great. *hugs*
00,02i'ma hide here
04But if you are a homosapien, then get creative
Creative then....
04Use paint and paper and stars and spoons and bricks and saws
04Don't forget colors
04Just not green
04Because green
04Is not a creative color
RaveBrony :3
04So then take your purple brick saw and apply directly to the material you're studying
use violet its always a awsoem color :D
04Once applied, sacrifice a small marsupial to Wal-Mart
Whatever you say Ghost...:D
04But makes sure it's from Australia!
Turned on my and saw "Phase4 is playing TF2" :D Glad to see its being streamed!! <3 :)
Phase4 could provide you with that.
and hiya XAX! :$
04Don't get fooled into believing what those damn marketers on those late night programs say, they are NOT 100% Australian
:D
Ghosties: ....this is not advice at all anymore.:D
xD
04Well fine
04If you don't want my advice
04Then I'll just go home
/me moves an inch away from his desk
04There
04Now I'm home

For the GLORY of AMN
so, yeah, the new D&D version?

4E?
Life_Essence: 5E.
I like Oblivions more
/me pokes TheRainbowDash
or D&D Next.
Ahh, got to go take a shower right now everypony. Be right back in 15 minutes, and then be on for 10 more minutes, and then I am heading off to school for finals.
I has the playtest kit.
cya TheRainbowDash
wtf?
Ghosties: Yeah, you know, like shot in the face.
do you believe in ghost
doesn't need to be the face
groin is equally as valid
or...
the knee
/me ducks
^no
Nah, I rather kill them then let them suffer....and no, never the knee.
I've killed people by shooting the soled of their shoes
/me 's iPod touch is currently playing the Song Friendship from Aviators ··[ Position: 04:32/05:04 · Album: · TrackNr: 0 · Genre: Unknown ]··
oh my...
XAX_: Huh?
the sound of a knee breaking...
makes a nice SNAP sound.
Nevermind that, be right back everypony from my shower, and umm, XAX, you want to join me....:D
TheRainbowDash: Lol, it's some silly command one of the IRC clients I have on my iPod. It tells the chat the details of the song I'm listening to >)
>_>
04* XAX_ 's iPod touch is currently playing the Song Friendship from Aviators ··[ Position: 04:32/05:04 · Album: · TrackNr: 0 · Genre: Unknown ]·· <-- da fuq is this?
lol
Ghosties: ^above
04Is that really necessary, XAX -_-
yadadadadada
Ghosties: ...probably not.
04Because I can see this becoming a distraction and possibly spam
so......
I'm playing The Spirit Engine Music
Ghosties: I kind of have to type the command for it to pop up in chat. It was just me being silly, and I wont do it again if you don't want me to.
SO AWESOME :O
EPIC
04Just don't overdo it
/me is listening to Winter Dance Up by SimGretina.
There we go. The shorter version...
but i wanted to know exaclty what position in the song you were in
it's important info
Life_Essence: :(
Ikr?
04That looks a lot better
04But again, don't overdo it. Some mods may find it spamming, just be careful
I won't :3
Not like many care what some rand on the net is listening to anyway, so no point.
04Maybe
but we care! (kindanotreally)
that depends what you're listening to
04Yeah, that too
I would give a shout out if it was something I liked
past that I'll ignore it
04Because I'll be honest if you said you were listening to a group I really like I'd be surprised :P
04No offense or anything
I'm pretty sure you'd get some comments if you were listening to La Mer by Nine Inch Nails or something
Well i mostly listen to "popular" pony music >.>
brb, coffee.
04>La Mer
04>NIN
04See
04Life_Essence knows what I'm talking about
04He picks one of the very best songs from The Fragile
04He must know
04That I love NIN
XD
._.
04Score one for Life_Essence
I was gonna say The Great Below cause I love that song but La Mer is more out there
04The Great Below is okay
04La Mer is better IMO
Hiya again.
Gdaaaaay

Twi eating them leaves, or whatever they are.
that assumes I save chat logs

Kammerjunk, if you find it beautiful, isn't that in a way what you want? And you will probably get that, so...
I always wonder how many people who use Photoshop actually bought it
RainbowAsh: My mind!
Ha ha ha. Paying for Photoshop.
outside of professionals
;
Hmllllll :3
though Photoshop has nothing on the licenses for the software i use for work
$10000 for one
I downloaded Photoshop elements 7 when I was in like... Year 8
04ohai HML
photoshop?
Drakeh
photochop.
04ohai Chime
IIRC, 3D modelling software costs more than Photoshop.
Does this man not know what Photoshop is?
Photocop. It's sort of like Timecop.
Blender doesn't :P
wth
I meant stuff like 3DSMax.
Kammerjunk: And that costs...?
I wouldn't think they;d be too far off each other
Life_Essence, freeware ftw, but sometimes you need a feature that is such a pain in the flank to code that you have to pay someone to do it
So many greetings
We luv echothr
XP
nyan
oh, Autodesk make 3DSMax
Yup.
I remember using Autosketch way back in 95
Oh ye olde days of computering
Manly looove
Let me guess this is one of thous matches wher one team are objecvts hideing in the stage? the problem with thous stages is that after a few matches on the same match the static objects rarely get moved around so, some one who knows the lay out like the back of the hoove would see the hiders quickly. Also some hiders hide outside of the bounderys of the stage.
? idk
Prophunt i think it's called
WAAAAAAAAALL! But yes.
Prop hunt on CSS
I come back to get smacked with a wall of text.
no
Twi_Fi: ikr?
hrhr hay Twi_Fi
Prop hunt on GMOD
3DSMAx is anywhere from ~$100 for student version up to $3495
SO MUCH FUN
tf 2 is madness
Hello
XAX: Well, 3ds Max costs around $5500-6500.
you're getting ripped off XD
http://usa.autodesk.com/3ds-max/how-to-buy/
Oh, wait. I'm on the suites page.
Hi SL
But still, that's $3500.
Kammerjunk: HORY SHET
gimme
00,02does it accept gif images or just tga?
Photoshop is what, 700 dollars?
00,023.5k
HA!
00,02yeah, its easier to learn blender
Match started.
it's always easier to learn blender
Phase4: Never tried with a gif
just takes time
...a LOT of time
Says 700 here, but I might just be doing it wrong again.
Hello :3
I think you're about right
on it's own
what the hell
:O
Hmmm, i wonder if i can join in on the server?
:O:O
yah Noir
do it
:O:O:O
of course then you couple 3DSMax with a Workstation + Renderfarm and you're looking WAY WAY more than photoshop
jesie creezy
This song sure is neat.
server ip is 69.162.110.91:27018
Server Raid
Life_Essence: ...render farm?
XAX: Lot's of high CPU, no GPU computers
._.

TF2, I see? :P
What I love about my new headphones for my iPod: I can put ANY picture in the windows on the side of them. What I hate: I can't lye with my head on it's side because the headphones are too big :(
It's like a headset
I get that with any headphones
though I'd rather my Sennheisers than a set of in ear buds
I can put up with lying on my side as long as they're just earbuds
they just end up hurting my ears
i got a flight headset its damn heavy xD
dat silence
If I have earbuds in bed, I lye with my head on my arm so my headphone isn't being pressed into my ear by my pillow :(

it boggled my mind
Life_Essence: wut

Did you get one of the expansions?
...no
I don't think so
I only just bought Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 like a month ago
Phase4: you have to set the picture in team fortress 2\tf\materials\vgui\logos so it can work corectly
00,02:<

Spell-of-Gaming: yah it wasnt so good
The Claustrophobia and Agoraphobia are my 2 favourite rollercoasters
04Guys, by the way, I don't know if you've heard from Val but don't forget that he wants all of you guys to send our beloved mod Luna users from all of BronyState, telling her just how much we appreciate her and all the hard work she does for us. If you haven't written a letter for her yet by all means do so but REMEMBER, AND I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, *DO NOT TELL LUNA ABOUT THIS!!!!*
4It is imperative it remain a surprise for her ;) When you are finished with your letters send them to valthejean@gmail.com. Thanks you guys, hope to see many letters from you guys :D
but everytime I tried to make them no one would go on them
Dat wall
04*beloved mod Luna letters from all of BronyState users
I wrote an Haiku, because I didn't really know that to write
The huge spiders on the RCT3 Wild Expansion are scary as hell.
about that she is impotatant to us
cartoning?
04Just tell her how much she means to you, if she does that is. The BronyState team would really appreciate it, guys :)
00,02i'm feeling that its time for another game
ANOTHER GAME
00,02allso do not tell luna
00,02I WILL DESTROY YOU SHOULD YOU TELL LUNA
What's the email again?

I'm planning to make it on our iPad, since I'm almost there everytime I'm not at the computer. :P
^^
Apple should really allow Flash on Safari.
Spell-of-Gaming the problem is that apple really doesn't like flash
00,02"The one thing you can't do is create too many frames--due to the Source engine's 120KB"
00,02my spray is 256k
00,02that sucks
I'm really mad at Apple for not allowing Flash and making the SDK for apps on iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad available only for the Mac. :I
and the is a good thing, Flash is really insecure and has o lot of flaws (at least the Video playing part for you internet Videos) thats why so many people really want to see HTML5 completed and implemented soon
To be honest, HTML5 isn't really going to go far if Flash keeps getting in the way.
Spell-of-Gaming true, unfortunatly :/ but Youtube already has an HTML5 test that you can eneable
00,02this thing dont like my gif
00,02this gif has 80 frames
yah
...

Coincidentally, "Apple Store Down" is trending on Twitter.

00,02another friend messaged me
Vordox, I was, for racial issues...
I just had a hunch that FiM really turns out towards those who don't follow the spectrum that the world has given us.
=<
And who knows that friendship is the thing that is proof of us living.
also, is that Applejacks FiM theme?
Vordox I was a guy who got picked on often, but it never came so far that i would have ever called it bulliing, there were just some jerks

WallDives: I feel so lazy in comparison...XD
wait, this is...
O.o
Sylandest, nah, I'm lazy, but I dont like having no stamina. Also, weighing 260lbs with no stamina is imo, unacceptable.
You guys ever hear of the legend of the dogman?

/me is now playing Saints Row 3, watching stream and Watching TV

not sure why
WallDives: duly noted, hehe. I don't have much in the way of speed, but I've got endurance the size of an ocean, lol
What is this

Airpuff: a somewhat actually enjoyable song
Rather cool song actually o.o
Airpuff: in a demented but wicked way
Phase4: you streaming this?

Ninjazz: Oh well, good for him :)

Ninjazz: you still have all of us! :D
And yes... Good for him.
00,02used to be the sound that was stuffing things u
00,02up'
Ninjazz: hehe beacuse i've been lurkin :P

Meanwhile: YES I AM MAD!!! :[
00,02i've never heard this version before
Phase4: What time is it in your place?
I hate this one solely because of Rina-Chan
00,02guy cant quite do the speed the flim flam actors could do
00,02|Discord|, 01:38
I like the "Shim Sham" version for the main reason that the name of the machine changes to nothing but "S's" (Shim Sham Sister Super Speedy Cider Squeezer 6000)
00,02not bad though
Phase4: Dude...you stay up to late
inb4 Horrible drinks.
actually I think it passed
00,02|Discord|, its worse when episodes are on
00,02woah stereo sep
