Spiders are cool.
I like spiders.

Allo SlurryMoon
Morning everpony!! :$

Allo RaveBrony
Ohai SlurryMoon
Damnit, i want Wreks pony playlist. :D

GESUNDHEIT
hey SlurryMoon hey RaveBrony
:$
and then I can't spell gudzugoejnhfkd
whatever
Like a baws.
Ty unfoundbug.
That's why you should tell your parents that you're a brony.
You know, give them time to accept the fact so that they'll let you go.
One does not simply go where they want at 12 years old.
one do if there are trains
:P
"Come mothers and fathers all over this land, and don't criticise what you can't understand. Your sons and daughters are beyond your command."
Would you let your 12 year old go by themselves somewhere on a train?
Trains? They still have those?
If they let me know about it in advance so i can check what it is and deem it safe enough, yea. :P
You're a bad parent.
Or would be. Theoretically.
hi everypony how are you all
Meanwhile: I would
Yeah, I'm probably assuming the ability to judge accurately.
I am never having kids with either of you.
Without any facts to back that up.
Allo F1uttershy
Meanwhile: when i was 12 i travelled by myself into the big city and stuff with my parents knowing, they didn't have a problem with it. :P
L.O, F1uttershy.
LOL i just notice that the other person name is Fluttershy and has a skin or it
Downloading minecraft 1st download wouldnt work just gonna refresh page mt streams stopped
I won't say you had bad parents because it'd be redundant.
I mean, if would do the research in this case, i'd get "Oh, he's going to a convention to meet other people who watch my little pony" . :P
I felt like a big kid riding the train by myself reading the schedule and whatnot
ah, Chicago
So who
Snuffsis: And if his parents are like so many others, they'd assume everyone there are pedophiles.
Wso who's streaming?
Which is laughable, really.
But then again, i live in Sweden where it's pretty safe to go anywhere. :P
Kammerjunk: Hah, pedophiles? That is ridiculous
Ooh its fluttershy
I couldn't make this stuff up if I wanted to.
September: Sounds about right... :rolleyes: :D
yeah lol. :D
So who's streaming?
Wrek.
my web browser derped
Hi
hi everypony
Allo mario_pony.

BronyinJapan, you there? Are there any Brony Meetups in Japan? :P
dont think so
Too bad.
needs to be brony meetups in russia
Fluttershy finally gets her sanity losing episode.
Yay.
:[
Meanwhile, I dub this castle Fort Friendship.
How about making one CCCP?
Brony meet-up in Serbia, lets freeze to death! :D
an episode where Fluttershy confronts her hidden anger issues.
CCCP: I feel there should be brony meetup conventions in all countries, linked through a series of webcams and representatives via Skype :P
im not in russia
oh......
September: we should become a political party
lolol
Bronies run for presidency.
September: That would be pretty cool. :)
CCCP: Hell. Yes.
Hi everypony im back!!
Promises to reinstate derpy or severe fines on Itunes.
Would we be right or left-wing though?
-Can't stop listening to "The Stars will aid in her escape PMV-
there would be world peace
And what are our goals.
lol MLP will rule the world
Can't we destroy it instead?
My first act as business would be
Build a rainbow factory.
Lol o.o
:D
NO!
CCCP thatd be funny the 45th president of the United States Fluttershy
With cupcakes.
lol
Many cupcakes.
Where your fears and horrors come true.
Meanwhile <3
^
You aren't allowed to talk about Cupcakes.
Our goals are to 1. Ensure the survival of the show for as long as the party stands 2. To create a new agency that will 'silence' any anti-pony complaints...
But I actually read Rainbow Factory like an hour ago.
3. Revive Derpy?
dat singing
I found it...obvious.
^^Sonic Rainboom: Can't do that. People will uprise for silence of speech. Hell would break loose.
4. World Peace
somone ping me
emangamer.
September: Easily solved, we'll also make bronies into a race, that way if they're hating on us, it will be a hatecrime. :P
damn...
DICTATORSHIP, I SAY.
Why?
Snuffsis: lol
Oh, that works too.
I cant get mIRC to make a noice when I get pinged
Snuffsis: Very smart! What physical properties make us unique as a race though?
Heil Friendship!
Gutted.
When was "Love and Tolerance" removed as our motto?
ohai emangamer
When they removed Derpy.
Because in the short space of time since Derpy was altered we have really taken a dive.
When they find diamond, who's gonna kill who?
September: We don't really need one do we? If we do, we could say that our races difference lies in our imagination and our acceptance and ability to love and tolerate.
we share and we care September. :3
unfoundbug will probably kill them all.
lol
I'm the one in the fluttershy skin <3
Jesus. Snuffsis that was an amazing reply.
I'm RaggedyDoctor
Dashie_Dashie: O rly? What's the server IP?
Difference inside..... Hm.
Never woulda thunk it.
Hi Everypony.
A creeper will blow 'em all up.\
Allo BritishBrony.
Meanwhile, gimme a second.
I'll pm you it.
O.o
They'll find diamond and then as soon as it's mined a lava stream will kill them all.
Nice, Scavender! :)
Wow Scavender
Scavender: thats pretty good!
Thats nice.
That's always what happens.
Awespme, Scavender
Nice Scavender!
Thanks guys, it is always nice to hear positive critique...
What program Scavender?
I hope they have beds there in Fort Friendship.
What texturepack are you using here, Dash?
Photoshop Ravebrony
03hg
What is a creeper?
HAI BRONYSTATE
Curse you all and your expensive photoshop! :'(
Walking green penis that explodes.
hi Ziltoidian
Creepers are lovely, they're just misunderstood.

It's not their fault they blow up when they just want to hug you
Yea I was saving for it for a while.
G'day Ziltoidian
/me yawns
brb
I simply MUST know the texturepack being used here.
Someone needs to put a sign so everyone will know the name of the fort.
It's Azas Arid Pack
You sounded like Rarity for a second there, September.
Lol!
So this a block mining simulator?
So where watching wrek play minecraft, awesome
SonicRainboom: Orly? Awesome. :D
It is known as Minecraft.
Kaboom
Blew up, lol.
You oughtta play Team Fortress 2. It's about collecting headware. but you get to kill people on the side!
Yep.

Dat minecraft OCD.
RaveBrony can you show how to do most of the ponies faces
So what's the IP to this server?
BronyinJapan, the emoticons?

Thx guys
Im not a huge AJ fan either, but id stilllike the mane 6 :D
AJ's fine.
c:
wats the IP 4 a minecraft server to go on with u guys??
AJ is awesome
I find AJ stereotypically southern. Which is kind of offensive to me since I AM in Alabama.
I still think :D should be created with this 'xD'
She's just not Twilight Twilight or Rainbow Dash.
...
I agree, RaveBrony
Why did I type twilight twice.
I want a more : D, smiley
Because magic.
Same.
Filth stairs.
"Brony International Guard?"
'D:<' Should be Pinkie Pie's broken promise face in The Last Roundup
Read it last night.
Yes^

It's hilarious.
Seems like an okay sotry
oh look, Human in Equestria
story*
Never break a pinkie promise!
He also wrote one where Harry Dresden goes to Equestria by accident.
She will hunt you down
any updates on if the derpy thing is just for the itunes version
Love all the accurate Fluttershy emoticons tho :P
I agree, I'm not usually a fan of humans in Equestria, but that's just hilarious.
SonicRainboom - which one? there's two stories like that that i know of
The one written by the same author of the story that's the new EQD post.
RaveBrony: What emoticons? :O
is there a stream
The faces, lol
There is alexxm
OH right, i'm using a IRC client... :P
Oh :p
Hii
Meh, is he cheating with creative mode now?! :O
Creepers! Kill them! they're evil!
Yes.
There are creepers.
How did he do that?
CupcakeWarrior - it's a Creative Mode Server
Nah, he's an admin so he can just type /gamemode 0/1
boom
depending on if you want creative or not
that too
I say! The bally creepers are going to blow a preposterous hole in your jolly good fort! Disgraceful show, old chap.

there is no hope for derpy
oh god...
oh
Kreoss might just be trolling
I really hope she is
Apparently its just iTunes and DVD's have her changed....
1,3good afternoon everypony :)
Torrent support material? :$
Morning kirzstryfe
Hey kirzstryfe! :P
Ohai kirzstryfe
1,3if you're talking about Derpy, the Friendship Express DVD has the original sequence still
i is it still in stock?
Really? :o
1,3comes out Tuesday
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uuQpvf-88 :O
RaveBrony: i have yet to see an actual source to back up that the dvd will be changed as well, or an actual source that say shasbro will air the original version on tv still
I swear if i buy it and its changed, im gonna have a shit fit when i take it back :D
Guize, do you like Wreks rendition of Helms Deep
xD
1,3I have a copy of the dvd, it's the original
:o
kirzstryfe: how did you get a copy?
1,3and no, I can't say how I got it, but it was a legal way
Kmart?
1,3>.>
kmart broke street date
lol
Lol :D
all the bronies now will charge to kmart!
Kwickie mart?
Isn't that from simpsons?
O.o
1,3technically, you're assuming the people programming the kmart registers are competent enough to set a street date on half the dvds
1,3they're not
lol!!!^
mfw my Kmart is a block away from me
CupcakeWarrior: buy all the dvds?
C ya in a while then CupcakeWarrior. :P
bye CupcakeWarrior
Also, what is that mfw, what does it mean?
Im not leaving
1,3comes in a 2 pack with the g3 movie
oh oops
i already pre-ordered mine from walmart, so i'm waiting until it should get here on march 5th
Snuffsis: my face when
it basically means :O
oh
Am I the only one whos actually watching the stream?
no I am
what is this stream you speak of?
Wrek, you should install MLPCraft. It's a client side mod turning everyone into ponies.
Im watching, but i dont have minecraft, so i dont understand it :(
Same here
im not reading fanfiction
How much is the DVD again?
O.o
1,3$10
Oh, ok :P
I dont have any money right now:(
1,3I prefer Terraria myself
Same CupcakeWarrior...
For a gaming experience, i prefer terraria as well, but if i want to build stuff i choose minecraft.
im eating hot dogs omnomnomnonm
1,3I start up terraria when I want to waste a couple of hours digging holes :)
i play both avidly kirzstryfe
minecraft sandbox mining game with rpg undertones, terraria = rpg game with sand box mining undertones
diggy diggy hole
Whtas Terraria?
hey everypony ^_^
Hi ScootaChicken
Kirzstryfe, want to see what i've started building in Terraria? :P
1,3*2D minecraft is the simplest way to put it
1,3sure
methinks there's a small chance that BritishBrony is from the UK
CupcakeWarrior: its a lot like what 2-d minecraft would be if it involved heavy rpg elements instead of just sandbox building
ScootaChicken: you dont say?
I had to hide in a hole during the night now, was too far away from the base to make it ^^
http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/468610754605559780/AD6991F8D7781FC3D304C61A08F50198E4497EFC/
Not really finished yet, but still, work in progress. :P
1,3hehe
Ingwaz: not sure what made me think it, just got a small hunch
1,3you should add torches in the body, so it's lit up
Snuffsis: that is a weird looking, presumably rarity structure
Yea, it's Rarity, still not finished with the body, she's looking a bit lanky near the neck, and also no hair/eyes or cutey mark
I would not have the patience to play this kind of game
I want to add torches to light it up, but it will look weird. So i'll just remove shading from the game when it's complete
terraria is a lot of fun, i've spent probably...40-50 hours on my most recent play through since i had to start over, so in total i've spent 143 hours
1,3when I start a new map, after I build a base I usually start on a massive hellevator
1,3current one will be the width of the screen, completely enclosed
Hahaha
I always make then 2 block wide, just enough to fall down through
kirzstryfe: i've never actually built a full helevator, always run in to water or something early on
Hellevator?
i usually instead build extremely winding paths so that only i know how to navigate them
1,3you just have to dig around a little to get the water to drain to the side
1,3hellevator: massive hole you can drop straight down to the bottom of the map
CupcakeWarrior: a hellevator is a straight shaft all the way to the bottom of the world
1,3have a hellevator and a 3-platform section stretching half the map to fight the Wall of Flesh (one of the game's bosses)
kirzstryfe - are you talking the old 128-high map or one of the new 255-high maps?
11,01No, it's a quick way to China.
1,3I think that one was on an older one
i mean your new one
Does this game have bosses?
CupcakeWarrior - yes
there is an "end boss"
1,3I stopped playing for a while just before the big updates
The Ender Dragon.
Wat is a IP for minecraft with u guys??
as for mini-bosses, not really
1,3new project is on one of the new maps
Only boss in the game.
Hello?
Owwww my head...
kirzstryfe: Y U SPAM UP CHAT
1,3:p
What the hell happened last night?
/me hugs kirzstryfe "why wub woo"
hey ScootaChicken thanks for saying hi
ScootaChicken is online?
so no one ever did answer me the past two days - what movies got picked for this week?
i usually find myself far stronger than i need to be to face a boss, even skeletron prime is weak
I love having the Hamdrax, you got one kirzstryfe?
1,3Raiders of the Lost Ark and Machete
Hellz yeah!
No seriously what the hell happened last night?

No..I have to do homework and drawings
ScootaChicken: yes...that was me being nice

Nope
The person was being annoying however
applejack096: chill on the caps, its a form of spam which is clearly in the rules
Just Rarity
rarity belle
CCCP: no I think her first name is sweetie belle
oh, nvm, hes already gone
I mean, it would be allcaps if the entire thing was in capital letters
but it wasn't so...
but her sisters name is sweetie belle so her last name must be belle
Do not question your overlords!
:'( :P
I think kirzstryfe scared applejack096 with that kick
:D
/me hugs ScootaChicken

pretty good otakon and you?
I assumed. I can't get a link of exactly where from Finding Nemo.
Eulshy

After Hasbro said they would show more of Derpy

TOY_PON3|Homework they said that?

wait what happened to derpy?
Im alright wif da voice change, but the eyes better be derpified...
for all we know it could just be the itunes version
/me is surprisingly British and a brony.
Ponycraft 2 & Lord of the Ponies gave me goosebumps
"Whoever said nothing is impossible has obviously never slammed a revolving door.
Iago

Jack Daniels MothaBucka
what's up oh nester of the bacon mane?
was their a mlp episode this week?
otakon: Was I acting weird last night?
00,01Nope.
nope
no
:( whyyyyyyyy
Yes
Some one should wright a fan fic called 101 things you wanted to know about slumber parties but were to afraid to ask.
The trick to drawing is drawing everything you can from life. Start with still life like a lamp and look at the shadows and stuff. Don't think of it as drawing a lamp, think of it as drawing shapes. Once you start seeing things as shapes and nothing more, drawing gets easier.
Of course not
TOY_PON3|Homework: um, a bit yes.
otakon: Really?
I don't remember..
so how about mlp crossed with this http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109506/
TOY_PON3|Homework: you were talking about trolling
Its ok. They released extended intro and news of a 2part finale. Should be fine.
AllTheGoodAtomsArgon: good advice, I'll keep that in mind. thanks!
otakon: What?!
Of course you were fine last night when the mods were asleep
Np countdoofus :p
DaringDude: What happened?!
and then a nasty little friend of fillyfilly's was on
nothing was odd or out of place
otakon: What?
I recommend getting a book called Keys to Drawing By Bert Dodson
yh, some troll named Sedrick
It's for the absolute and utter beginner
put up some nastiness
Who's Sedrick?
umm you were flirting with umm i think it was RainbowJavk
unless I can order it online
friend of fillyfillly's
http://images.wikia.com/mlp/images/9/93/Awwww.jpg
how late was it? I remember some words flying back and forth last night
DaringDude: What....the....fuck....
lol was funny
it was about 2 am or so
Oh damn I need to stop drinking..
the mods were asleep
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DwuL29Uj8A&list=UUY30JRSgfhYXA6i6xX1erWg&index=1&feature=plcp

What happenend at 2am...?
Oh, where are you from Count?
TOY_PON3|Homework: you were DRINKING? good lord

Pyrexo: troll, was invited in by fillyfillly
otakon: Remember how I was sad about ex girlfriend?

Oh

DaringDude: What did I do?

Then there's a guide on Chibi & Furry Manga, & Anatomy for Fantasy Artists

DaringDude: Pretty much yeah

CCCP: I did...
Must because of the number of people who screamed for the Smile song in the previous episodes
But Smile brings tears to y eyes for some reason.... tears of joy? old hurts? meh, idk
Rainbowdash : Saved the Wonder Bolts twice and did the sonic rainboom twice, yet she's still not a wo

Judging by friends eractions i dont think so :D
It feels like a crappy movie!
*reactions
/me hits RaveBrony with a brick with force
CCCP not that I can say much I just had a bit to drink but am clear headed (to say sober is wrong as I have drunk anything)
There that's a hangover
o_o
Ow!
It hurts...A LOT
I don't like coffee, beer, or tea. I'm weird.
And that's how my head feels..
08,01otakon: someone on the team has his phone number, i'm sure. i'll ask on skype
i feel bored
KwakLad2: oh
It hurts more than Season 2 episode 16 getting taken down before you could watch it
KwakLad2 are you Kwaklad's clone? :O
Only time ive been close to drunk is when i had 2 glasses of wine... :\
dat KwakLad is a spy!

CCCP: Since I discovered ponies I stopped smoking
Ive only had a contact high...and while it was rather soothing, i didnt like it at all
I dont smoke weed, i steal it from the potheads at my school and sell it back to them for twice the price
Wrek: You're tempting me..

Nah cigarretes are nasty for me
I draw for stress O.o
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3003/

Okay let's say I was a pothead for about 3 years
I don't even want to try smoking.
hahahaah 20% cooler
i must admit i smoked cigerettes a bit a couple months ago, then i found ponies
Pyrexo well I'm out of luck too I want a me clone, someone to punch when I do something that embarrasses me or annoys me
And when I seen MLP I realized it's not right so I stopped
dat Dashie flying next to it xD
Ponies override addiction.
Ponies>Smoking
MLP is my drug
^
Don't smoke Don't do weed, I just drink on occasion :P
Same here CCCP
I just cant stop looking at the pony related content
This Stream. It is missing Something.
CCCP agreed
Something important.
Gunthler aw no way i just said the same thing, ya crazy cat! huhuhuhuh
I do admit though..I smoked weed while watching FiM several times
O_o
Pyrexo: and herion

my dog is the greatest in bed
he HATES you
DERPY NEEDS TO DERP
Oh
ok im done
derpy needs to derp in bed
No
00,01No.
derpy needs to derp derp derp derp derp
Hasbro UNDERPED derpy...
Pyrexo: Yeah. I don't know the whole story but apparently she didn't like how Derpy's original voice was either and brought up some valid points. I don't know the whole story but apparently people are taking it to heart and let's say that the messages they left her were not love and tolerance
Pyrexo: how u use italic?
dat wall of text
you are going to LOVE ME in bed
No!
Oh dang. And...oh my..
Derpy was 'OFFENSIVE'???
I'm texting my boyfriend in bed. Which is what I actually am doing?
Fucking idiots
derpy is not offensive
I KNOW
in bed
....
In the bed. Yeah. in the bed. Oh! IN THE BEDDDDDDD!
Derpy is so offensive that she's not offensive
kill that guy
00,01I sleep on my bed.
THey need to go back and redo bonbon's voice then!
Bmyed
sorry Matt, not gonna work
13it's cute when people put the mode symbol before our nicks when trying to ping
even if Matt Smith IS the best doctor
one does not simply call upon dari
Pomf in my bed.
Wats not gonna work?
no pomf
I don't think it's offensive. There were some parents that thought it was offensive because it made fun of handicapped people, but some bronies were complaining of the very same thing.
hmm nothing
Matt, dont tempt dari.
1,3all the pomf
/me noms kirzstryfe :3
Ibedmyipomfn
hiya kirzstryfe what's up?
/me hugs LadyCanary
Derpy is so offensive that they had to take her off the show completely

1,3lurking, as always :)
bye guys ig gonna sleep..
Derpy is offensive in bed
00,01Later.
how are you today Shizuka
:)
13bleh
00,01Hi %@+Shizuka!
enough with the beds! :[
D: Why so bleh dearest Shizuka
So now, because of this, Hasbro edited Derpy and everyone's having a fit at Yamino for expressing her opinion of it, yet nobody is doing the same at these parents or bronies who did it.
13bleh.....
Hello Everybody.
AttackWithHugs: I think it's offensive now, they felt they needed to change it. So remember kids, if you don't like how someone sounds or looks just because, it's okay to try and change them
/me hugs Shizuka. Whatever it is, it will get better. I know it.
Derpy is so offensive that even I was offended by the derp
hiya Aircrafter
And hi Aircrafter
When it start and Refresh the stream?
hi Aircrafter
/me 13hugs canary~
Cole: no idea, Vi isn't on yet or she might not even be on.
Heya Otakon, LadyCanary. I had a little nap. Hey TOY_PON3. Fell asleep at the keyboard. anything important missed?
^_^
One does not simply call upon dari!
Shizuka: it's a "meh" stage, you'll get over it dear.
Not much Aircrafter. Though I believe the radio show will be starting soon
sweeet.
maybe if we SOS
/me yawns.
My bed. My bed. Welcome in my bed.
no, wait that'll just summon the Seaponies........
One does not simply dari into Mordor
In bed my.
Matt: How about you type 10 letters in 5 seconds
Pegasus'
try it it will work
....oops
...
TOY_PON3, dont do that.
no seriously do it he will show up
No, no, you go to your bathroom, turn off all the lights, and say his name three times.
ABCDE.
LadyCanary: I'm not doing it I'm telling Matt to
jdhfy
no not like that
/me uses the Royal Canterlot Voice
I know, but you shouldnt tell someone to do that
otakon: I loved her original voice. It was so adorable to hear it that I squee'd. But apparently it's wrong because I read one of the coments left on Yamino's dA saying that thir little cousin/brother who was disabled didn't like the show anymore because he thought the other ponies were making fun of Derpy.
HELLO EVERYPONY!
hiya Paradise92
Hii Paradise92
hi Paradise92
LadyCanary: Ain't I a stinker? :P
otakon: Also, I apologize for the walls of text.
/me hugs Scoot-Scootaloo :3 :3 :3
How TOY_PON3?
00,03Are we STILL obsessing over Derpy's voice?
type in letter, then keep doing it rapidly
Wait..they're doing something with derpy's voice?
/me hugs LadyCanaru back
AttackWithHugs I didn't like her first voice, but I did love her. And it had it's charm about it. They need to Derp up her new voice, and it'll be perfect.
What are they doing too poor DERPY?
GENTLEMEN
AttackWithHugs: eh, no worries. and Yamino should have explained the other ponies WEREN'T making fun of Derpy
Seriously how u use italics
OK
hhhhh
*Snort* Be you angels?
GabeMEN
I believe so, Scoots.
Nay
We are but men!
so what are we talking about?
No Matt, do it like this
d
ds
Sorry, we are but Bronies*
Wait, can someone explain too me why we're obsessing over derpies voice?
o i get know
Sky_Pirate_Brony: They can try to Derp the new voice, but to me there's nothing like the original.
h
hg
hgf
hgfd
Aircrafter: completely edited her debut scene on iTunes. No name is mentioned, her eyes are underped and her voice is now a vapid imitation
00,01Bronies don't have to obsess over a voice change.
Saw the 50 Bronies I should know. I know 19. Pretty good I thought.
hgfds
bye Matt
Why?
Everyone Refresh at 3pm
inb4 daribot kick
do it faster -.-
otakon: Shush!
I still think Derpy should just have a permanent G Major voice.
lol
DARIIIII
no
just daribot
like this Matt
d
Otakon: Wait...they're making derpy normal or...wait whats going on ._.
dt
his computer is still on
e
Am I really the only one who thinks such?
lol
GODDAMNITDARIBOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
otakon: Yamino should have but everyone's entitiled to their opinion and you can't change what people think, unfortunately. You can try to persuade but that's probably as close as you can get.
Who was it that said she sounded more like a dumb blonde with the weird voice? That was my thought too.
I guess I am.
Ohai MattSmith
Ready to Refresh?
Hey TOY_PON3 That was not nice!
/me troll faces
who is streaming?
00,01Derpy's eye's glow red as she goes "I just don't know what went wrong." in G major.
and what?
GO!
AttackWithHugs: agreed, and I like her work too. I just thought all the hate must not be from her or she had at least a good reason to say what she said.
flutter_spin that's something someone brought up. That the old name Ditzy Doo was more offensive, as a blond pony named ditzy?
imma get off and do some sh*squee* look me up on xbox live when you get the chance. Gamertag is xXSilveR SoleDXx
Isn't ViRadio supposed to be on?
bye TheHoodyninja
such big paragraphs
Ohai Otakon and all!
00,01Those Xx's.
I HAVE RETURNED
00,03TheHoodyninja: I'm will do! I'm CMCScootaloo117
00,01He left.
wheres violet D:
00,03and dem X's...
Her... inflection? in the voice is odd too.
Nuuu :(
who left??
man guys, that new episode today was AMAZING...it had a great story and great character development the best song of the series, and was so bucking funny
OOoooh, do I smell VIDEO GAMES?
Is dari here?
emangamer OH U
o
flutter_spin The original VA didn't know Derpy was a girl.
emangamer: indeed, oh u!
two Matt Smiths?! holy shit
._.
Im Matt Smith loser!!
i take it there isn't a stream
Guys, really, dont do that.
Sky_Pirate_Brony: yh, but it was still endearing
hey were is the radio?
that MattSmith01 is a spy!
alexxm: enope, not atm
yeah I know. But it now makes it double derped. More character :P
LadyCanary: do what?
No im no!
The whole Matt Smith thing.
otakon: Everybody's going from what they read in a Tumblr post she made, and that's why she's getting all these death threats and hate. Not everyone displeased were doing that but it was a majority. It almost shames me to be a brony because now people who were considering the show are probably not going to watch it all because some immature people don't know how to express their feelings in a civilized manner.
Why?
otakon True enough...I just thought ti'd be better as a female. The new voice is cuter, just needs more derp.
How many times have we heard characters like bonbon sound wrong
Anypony up for videogames? Lack of stream means gaming time.
LadyCanary: Matt Smith needs to Matt Smith Matt Smith because Matt Smith is Matt Smith ya know?
Jaketehsnake depens on the console
ok are they any famous people who are bronies
Jaketehsnake PC or PS3
00,03I prefer Matt Groening
otakon: Hell, even Keross (I think I spelled that wrong) said that Yamino had nothing to do with the chanve.

0,14...you know it seems that you tend to show up when I'm dressed up as a janitor
Sometimes you just hafta take what life gives ya, 'cause life is like a mop and sometimes life gets full of dirt and crud and bugs and hairballs and stuff... you, you, you gotta clean it out. You, you, you gotta put it in here and rinse it off and start all over again and, and sometimes, sometimes life sticks to the floor so bad you know a mop, a mop, it's not good enough, it's not good
enough. You, you gotta get down there, like, with a toothbrush, you know, and you gotta, you gotta really scrub 'cause you gotta get it off. You gotta really try to get it off. But if that doesn't work, that doesn't work, you can't give up. You gotta, you gotta stand right up. You, you gotta run to a window and say, "Hey! These floors are dirty as hell, and I'm not gonna take it any more!"

Hurr lol liaf
Thtas DEFINATELY not biase
*biased
CupcakeWarrior, dr-whooves have you ever heard the term "Nothing nice to say SHUT THE FUCK UP?" that applies here, if you didn't like it mute it and SHUT THE FUCK UP. Most of us DO like it.
...this seems familiatr
otakon: Fuck em up
....is that a digimon soundtrack?
dr-whooves: of course we're biased, we're an irc community
IK
OK
*
ugh. i've been fighting it, but I definitely need a 2-3 hour nap...
If you dont have anything nice to say dont say it at all.
it's a sombre version of the digimon theme
Chill out guys.

dr-whooves: Just shut up

I've never seen Bebop ;3;

Ok. :(

SaxyPretender: just check Cowboy Bebop
I have returned
Gumri: I see our coding is still working properly for you ^_^
True. But we're also most modest.

This song is nothing compared to DJ Satomi~Castle In THe Sky
wb Jaketehsnake
0,14thanks, Vi
Hello Jaketehsnake.
And now it's been mentioned Vi's an admin, it would probably be a good time to explain who has powers in heree
WildPinkiePie THIS^
Hmm, I wonder what SaxyPretender's having for dinner...
WildPinkiePie: I would need proof for that
0,14probably chicken
11,01I want to hear Vi again.

it sure does
0,14I'm off to dinner, be back soon
FUUUUUUUUU-
WildPinkiePie: um........ having heard the original song this is FAR too fast it seems and lacks the emotion of the original I think.
well, its over huh : <. well time to make my food NOW =w=
TheWall: and for the rest, you'd have to /whois names individually XD
bye saxy
I hate my dad so much for this...
You have the worst timing in the whole universe ScootaChicken. You totally pulled an otakon.
11,01No Tool. Oh well.
though they never act
AAAAAAA http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1572/
I miss Vi's voice even though someponies didn't like it
so the point is moot
Meanwhile: ohrlly?
11,01Or "Get Up"
And as Makerdusk just mentioned, some mods may be incog
TOY_PON3: me too man, me too.
Meanwhile: 'pulled an otakon'?
so just be nice.
/me brohugs otakon
ScootaChicken: no net
otakon: Yeah. He missed EVERYTHING and showed up mere seconds after it ended.
oh god...
that is some godawful timing
Literally seconds
Like
TheWall: eyup, the network was designed to allow undercover ops
/me takes an arrow to the knee
Just this minute
i thought pulling an otakon was lagging out?
It ended
DAMNIT

Q: How old are the ponies?The ponies' ages were left intentionally undefined. I like to think of them as having maturity levels anywhere between 12 and 18, (but remember that maturity is different than age. You can be a 10-year-old with the maturity of a 15-year-old, and you can be a 35-year-old with the maturity of a 15-year-old.) For story telling purposes, they needed to be able to live independent of parents, but innocent en
that can be right after all your are the Dr.

You don't have to BE a pedophile for parents to call you one. Anypony who isnt the same age as their child and talks to them is a "pedophile" Otakon
Anyway, reason you might find my age amusing otakon is because my birthday is the 13th.
05,15In my mind, the ponies are in their late teens and early 20's
<(o.o<) (<o.o)<

fluttercry: you read wall?
simply through sheer amount of exposure
<)
unfoundbug: ikr?
Jaketehsnake: no, anyone who is sexually attracted to a child is a pedophile. Just bc i talk to teenagers here does not make me a pedophile.

saxypretender
I mean, what the hell?
/me is repuSynorB46
otakon: they're gonna make another
have you heard of "two best friends play">
ScootaChicken: how very peculiar.

Meanwhile: we need to study this British mindlink thing
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdZ1va0AQYc&feature=g-hist&context=G22d995aAHT0rP1AAMAA
/me pounds Tovler into a fine dust with a cinderblock.
Heehee. Sheep.

05,15because that makes sense
dum dum dum duuummm dum
Sheep are almost as annoying as cows.
/me is blown away by the Andre 3000 part
0,14^
My work here is done then, TOY_PON3
repuSynorB46: ?maerts uoy t'naC

Do ya thing~
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fya-4TbURNc&feature=related BESST THING EVAR
Cloverfield was an awesome movie
WRONG
Cloverfield gave me motion sickness after a while
/me hits lemur with a tractor.
I live in a giant bucket
otakon: what is your favorite godzilla monster?

EPIC SAX SPIKE
/me is repuSynorB46
Groverfield
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xhIX4qr9JI Does your Godzilla have an awesome song like this?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fya-4TbURNc&feature=related
you gotta be kidding me! cloverfield was cool!
oops
05,15ScootaChicken it's a city isn't it?
0,14ofc it would be Roar!
mario_pony: Gigan, the GIANT SPACE SCOOTALOO!
Cloverfield would've been better if it had proper camera work.
fluttercry: it's a city in Wales infamous for the mining facilities
otakon: mine is mothra
05,15WTF! Why didn't they stay there then!
0,14actually, the wonky camera was what I liked about Cloverfield
Mothra?
which were basically completely horrible and had terrible working conditions
But no. Shaky cam and the phrase "RUN BRO" for a couple hours.
really?
there is a city called Derp
MOTHRA!
11,01"You're working for Mothra now."
lol
otakon king girdorah
0,14often in monster movies, you get the perspective of the scientist or the army
13wait you liked the shakycam?
It seemed so realistic because it was shot so poorly.
ah, King Ghidorah
Meanwhile part of the point is it was SUPPOSED to be shakycam
Meanwhile: but you totally got to see a CGI monster for about a quarter of a second
Really
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3sDenJwtJ8&feature=related you won't make it
yh
11,01I liked Cloverfield.
Eww, King Gidorah doesn't even have arms
0,14rarely about the actual people
05,15Run bro! Dude run!
Shaky cam is sorta annoying but it didnt make it horrible
Shakycam sucks goat gnads.
otakon: what i like mothra so what?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3sDenJwtJ8&feature=related WATCH IT ITS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CUTE
bat backwards uperbrony64
hey SuperBrony64, im repuSynorB46
Mothra had so much backstory. What was up with those twins Mothra had?
Tovler: soo what he still kicks ass
http://www.whiterose.org/pete/blog/images/upyours.gif
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caIBKOztlAo&feature=related
nothing it's just Mothra is like the weakest of them all, she is ALWAYS getting her ass kicked left and right and usually only wins by using Self-Destruct and then the daughter shows up next movie.
It's a giant moth
What do you bucking expect.

See this is awkward because you're taller than me. Honestly ScootaChicken, toughen up.
05,15Where are you at! Where are you at!
It just gets in your throat and hinders your breathing. It's dangerous and I'd be surprised if people weren't hospitalized for it. I had kids trying to do this in my class and I had to explain to them how stupid it'd be if I had to call the nurse for them because they decided to take a dumb dare.

*online
oh so this isnt blind
somepony cuddle me.

I need an adult.
Never seen this game before in my life and am 100% sure it won't scare me
Dead Space is jumpscare nonsense
/me cuddles ScootaChicken

Luna should be in this game

I'm not usually on this time of day
o.o.
Okay okay, somepony explain how Amnesia is sooooo scary

Boo
Meanwhile: tell me what it is
Deadsspace makes me wanna shi* myself at some points
It's scary because the monsters are naked and some of them have visible dicks
Meanwhile: Yeah Meanwhile you, me and a few other were here when that happened i think
TOY_PON3: you rate dead space scarie than amnesia?
AAAAAAW
Dead Space is just an fps with some really ugly bad guys that have a habit of suddenly appearing from vents.
PinkiePieCopy: lol
Amnesia is exploring the unknown. When there is light and a weapon, you usually know what to expect
lol double name ref
