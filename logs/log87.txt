No more.
BABY DON'T HURT ME
9igl: SOMETHING I REMEMBER
9once
9THERE WAS A WAR
now, i watch ponies...have i reverse aged?
EVER HEARD OF VANDREAD?
oh gundam it!
yes
yeah
04^
Soo?
03^
vandred is great
Woo Gundam!
I watched Vandread when puberty hit. Imagine where that went.
lol
GUNDAM WING= BEST GUNDAM
9>Gundam Wing
Gundam Seed ruined it for me
9>Best Gundam
9dude, Wing was bland as fuck
Wing was emo as fuck
TROWA WAS COOL THO
9that said
i must confess: i never really watched gundam before
COME FORTH, POWER OF LUNA!
why would i be ashamed about watching a show that burns of man?
I don't remember anything story wise, but design wise Talgeese and its three forms were the most epic robots ever
7I think I'd rather keep my real identity away from a place where anything is available to anyone.
6well
9it's the sequel novel that's currently in serialization
6tbh
9give me amoment
6if someone really wanted to know
6they'd fins out
6find
03\
6that aside though
03^
03I wasn't asking for names and faces :P
9I used to read Gantz
03^
I mean
Family
Any1 ever read Berserk
This is the second show that involves the utter destruction of Earth
Not names, they're everything
I take it this isn't a Universal century series
03if you go
No, not Universal Century.
03I have two sisters
I've only watched Mobile Fighter G Gundam
lol
6I see Topaz here.
9also
03</sarcasm>
delayed kick is delayed
he has no arms
9After War: pretty much an alternate UC
03so yeah, kinda a bogus argument :P
7Yeaaaaaaaaaah, you won't change my mind.
THE LIVE ACTION MOVIE OF GANTZ WAS DISSAPOINTING THO
04It was scary.
9but yeah
03and knowing that
03I'm going to stalk May's profile and find yours :)
/me runs
04XD
I make a habit of covering up my tracks
Apparently.
03:)
I did. It was... well.
04I've gotten relaxed in my efforts to hide my identity
WELP
03so have I LOL
9and if you liked Wing you should probably read Glory of Losers http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/New_Mobile_Report_Gundam_Wing_Endless_Waltz:_The_Glory_of_Losers
no
dose tv trope even have an entry for that, the carpet colony drop?
03I give out my real name all the time now
04It's not really worth it when I'm not doing anything I'm ashamed of
HOLD ON, LET ME CHECK...
YEP, IT"S OUT
Suzaku is a character i really hate
I dunno. But you can see ALL THE CRATERS it made
6I'd say I'm relaxed
6but I don't advertise everything about me
04I always used to think (and thanks to NS for hammering it into me) that I needed to hide everything about me.
9Riders: same here...but then it became "B-Movie Interesting"
Earth got fucked up
not Baja califorina!
7Well, do you guys know my real name? :P
2nd eh
6as for my name, that is one thing I still keep wrapped, you'll only know my online name
9but yeah
I read the manga and wanted to kill myself.
04Nope @Quan
9Wing sequel up there
6unless you happen to know my real name by tracking, in which case that's fine
9it's canon
OH SHIT TWO-HEADED SNAKE
yes
Basically
Yesss
7:O
6ok well a LOT of people know my real first name

9OHAI BEST GUNDAM PILOT

7The only actual screenshot I linked of me is my hand. X3

9He is such a total BAWS
I have a half-brother now

;-;
03Quanyails, yeah, it was when you were trying to fix some computer issue and you sent me a screenshot.
9seriously
Does his zaku have a matching mohawk?
03:P
9AND THAT'S WHY HE'S AWESOME
7Computer issue?
7What was it, exactly?
uh oh
NAILBATS
H
HELP ME
LYNCH LYNCH
Oh damn his zaku doesn't have a mohawk.
03this was like a year ago, I don't really remember
That would have been hilarious.
9seriously

*NOW
9he's the least emo Gundam protagonist
bits?
04Oh
04NS
9and he lives in the MOST POST-APOCALYPTIC WORLD
?
04My friends think you're cool
04Just saying.
7The story doesn't sound familiar.
._.
9the lack of emo
Why doesn't Quan share her pics with us
:p
03^
/me runs
lack of emo is always good
9just everything that's good about Gundam with none of the emo
huh

04Between you guys I bet you could turn #SW into a copy of how #True-Flame is.
you missed hot robot-on-SirSprinkles action
9this series wasn't even subbed
I'm guessing the other Gundam pilots eventually join the protagonist?
but in Japan everythin is expensive XP
14...ha

04Seriously. The amount of innuendo you two share is beyond me.

YEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS
epic punch
9>avoid mech from robbing a bank
They're kinda slow but in an awesome way.
turtling
9>cause more collateral damage than the money the mech would steal
It emphasizes how fucking huge they are.
Destruction is never unnecessary
Its like boxing

Then it wouldn't be anime
Obs

12i just can't think straight, my head is in such a tangle from everything that has been going on
6...I want those eyebrows.

12it's kind of frustrating
12i like to pride myself on how level headed i am
6thats good
out-smugged
12i usually keep my emotions on a tight tight leash, it's embarassing that i even allowed myself to feel anywhere near this bad
all that music from one key
9Proto-Vocaloid
i hate miku
9of course
pardon
9*Prototypes

IT DOES HAVE A HOLE IN IT
ACTION
THAT MAY CAUSE ISSUES
12have you ever felt like really strong bonds with friends were being forcefully yanked out by them personally? for no reason
The Hensh <3
Honestly I'm not really sure
I want a color script
04?
04lol
I used to have scripts
Gopher
but then my computer's memory was wiped
!commands
List of commands and mIRC help topic: http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=7075.0
and I forgot how to make themm
It's in that topic
lol
we've all been there
6umbreon, yeah, assuming I read that sentence correctly
12rephrase it then
when does bruce waynce ever do that?
i seen enuf hentai
again
12in simple words, yes
Val: He does it sometimes. And he's rich enough for all the cool toys!
12multiple friends
like, ever
that face
ACTING!
Eh.
yup i know where this is goin
6yeah
Whatever. Drill.
Drill, Heavens, Etc
6I had a couple of friends decide that I was a horrible person
6which...seems to be a running theme with people
6I don't know why
12then the last time i tried talking one of them all i got was a "leave me alone"
/me idles again
12i had to do something extremely drastic to even get their attention again
wrist watch
04o_O
Grappling watch.
Yes he is
why does he care about this android?
12no brees were harmed
I think breaking it is a much faster solution...
6drake
Because she asked him for help
6people are just unreasonable sometimes
It's his current job
12Drake
6irrational
12i don't know
6it's quite painf-
9and yet he's a playable character in SRW
04It is conpletely illogical.
as you watch the show she shows a bit more emotions
04Also stupid.
Rodger is strong to jum while holding her
12indeed it is spock
04/noactualadvice
9yeah, Beck
12i admit
9OHAI BECK
Hi
eyup
two inspector gadgets?
12that i have done... things with questionable intent to friends in the past
TURN OFF THE LIGHTS
ACT LIKE WE ARENT HOME
04As everyone has.
12but that was over a year ago when i did that
punch it
12i have completely matured and redoubled my efforts to make sure that mood never happened again
6was that related to this current event?
12i don't know
6shall I rephrase
Low power pressure punch
or at least bruised...
dat harmonica
6is it the same group of people involved in the last one?
eyup
12i lost like 6-7 friends
dat pillowhead
12and slowly regained back most of them
12so yes
classy
Dorothy looks cute in ithat
you have to go DEEPER
... he has the name "Wayne" in his own name. I just realized that.
/me is unusually dense today, I guess.
12i understand that respect is easy to lose and hard to gain but it's been over a freaking year since i did that
...huh
Snark
6well
12why does the past haunt people and imprison them
it's dean
6depending on the person, it's poosible to hold grudges
...Joke?
Next, the BEST SHOW EVER
6and I hold grudges for ages
12well one of them
This isn't?
that was...interesting to say the least
12i know is avoiding me because they are in an even worse depression than i'm in right now
04well
Chicks!
04You can't blame them for that.
04But the others?
12the other i heard was kind of scared of me
NICE!
12because he's the ex of my ex
anything next?
megas
Megas XLR
Megas xlr
wow really
AND NOW FOR SOMETHING
Yes
9brb
EPIC
9gotta fix the stream
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/bac30d0abf7db05d02a4bd1ae358394b/4665 - megas_xlr parody pinkie_pie.png
12however that doesn't fully explain that behavior suddenly happening
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
12the last one i haven't a clue
I'd use that button.
9we're live again
04:/
/me 6hugs
You're sense of fasion, Pinkie, It's obnoxious
6this could just be my horribly obnoxious optimism
12the last i've literally known for years
THERE. Finally.
This specific copy looks oddly familiar
Megas XLR: The only mecha anime (heh) I like.
Thought it was gonna crap out on me right when we got to my favorite.
ooh what's this?
6I guess I can't really speak for anyone else but myself, but I still stand by that
It's not anime, technically.
Megas XLR
Megas XLR
DAT OLD SCHOOL LOGO
12thx
This is the only show I've seen before
12i really wish i knew the nature of the situation though
12so i knew how to act accordingly
of all of the ones shown tonight.
The Glorft units make me think of Orcs
or Orks
6there are somethings that just require you to sit back and try to forget it happened
6er
12i might stab the issue right one
12*on
6in the past
Hope my stream isn't behind.
12i might stab something important
6(note to self, never read and type at the same time)
12or i might stab just plain air and get no where
oh and the one with the powerrangers
Dat Kiva.
Wny can't American animators do more of this kind of thing
6^
6I'm guilty of it though
12if a grudge is truely the heart of the problem
we need mecha ponies
somehow
12it wouldn't make much sense, that mood i was in, didn't effect them in anyway
Just because they think you're bad doesn't mean everyone else does
... seriously, Ponies + Transformers = Awesome.
The first person to write a good mecha pony fanfic wins
yes I can imagine Twilight as Shinji
12i'm not saying i am
you know kiva's VA is also in bleach yes?
12i'm just saying at one point in the past
The past is the past
12i was in a really bad mood
let bygones be bygones
seriously
dwelling over something isn't going to help
Why not just pilot Megas?
6the past is past, that's a wonderful quote coming from you
because they already lost
The only VA on this show that isn't in VA still is Coop's.
12Ascendant, i have, but i think that's what's happening right now and i can't just go upto them and be like "let bygones be bygones"
6you of all people, I lifted my grudge on you looooong ago lol
I like how he's using an iPad
the point is it could have made the difference before when it was still helpful
kiva is voiced by wendee lee or as you know haruhi suzimiya
It's actually an Etch-a-Sketch
well hey, we all change
That's a shame, Coop's VA is pretty good.
Yeah.
I'm not THAT much of an idiot anymore ):
6exactly
Coop's VA is playing the father on Wizards of Waverly Place.
6LOL
6well
XD
6anyways
12people mature
6people change
They're not worth it
6but I think the problem with me is most people I hold grudges against, they never truly felt apologetic
haha
6but at the same time
6I've held grudges even then
6so I dunno
12aren't we jumping to conclusions?
most people can't accept that they're wrong
6my mind works strange, even for my own self to comprehend
Good thing they couldn't hit the broad side of a oh shit.
12like i said, i don't know anything about why this is happening
well, not most, but a lot
6bree I'm just going on a tangent here, sorry
heh, well
12it could be as bad as them just hating my guts
12it could be as simple as they don't have time for me anymore
OH YEAH!
She's also Faye Valentine
man watchin this b4 i head out to college
seems she has done tons of anime
Best.
wait a minute
She's alos fay valentine
that va
And I made it propose to her lol
Oh yeah. The soundtrack for MEGAS is one of my favorite things.
It's fucking metal.
04LOL
And then she thought it really was her boyfriend
04I remember that
12o_O
Yeah
aww yeah
fuck yeah
I was guilty for once
;_;
Dude just destroyed his own house.
Ever.

12i remember once
04For once.
Yeah.

12i'm not going through the stress of doing it again

Also, I get the feeling the show's creators did not like MTV.
Also, MTV dissing
my bad
They've done us a public service
|D
12wb D:
9they actually had a show on MTV
9before Megas

And nothing of value was lost
I still can't believe the pilot is only half an hour. It feels like only yesterday that Toonami was presenting this to me as a movie.

/me attempted to quote a really bad line from a really bad movie, but ended up sparking an interesting conversation.
12# is used to indicate a channel name, ocean.lugia.us is the server
Well kind of, I could go with that :P

6Frankly I don't care to know.
6You have a sleep schedule?
6I wish I had one of those.
12no it can't be because i managed to join
I use the term loosly
/server ocean.lugia.us
12give it a couple seconds then type /join #silverwings
many a night I have planed on going to sleep earlyer then norm then end up on YT or TV tropes
I'm starting to kinda dislike TV Tropes

Some people are already starting to use its advice seriously
Someone made a password generator off that
6Possibly.
._.
I have a !genpass script
6Honestly we rarely even run things by eachother anymore. We generally agree on most ideas. =/
04holy crap
04I only just realised May joined HoR
04Shock and horror
Passwords like I*b7*(k97
6And there'll probably be some form of tentative schedule for the streams throughout the week at some point...
And impossible for us to remember
heh
I use passwords like j0asJ3kJs9d012
04I haven't been on HoR for like, 3 weeks
And I find them easy to remember after a while
eh
they're okay
it's faster to crack hashes
and lol hotmail
And then expect you to use passwords like that
yeah
lol
My password is 15 characters long precisely because of this
04Seriously
04I'm gonna use that image everywhere now
and not just half an episode of Megas :P

!genpass

/me 6walking touhou encyclopedia
no classes on fridays, but Monday's starting with Philosophy at 8:00AM
6...
6that's weird
6cuz i gave you the same copy i downloaded
6and mine does lOL
13Not that it matters too much considering I won't be able to read it anyway LOL
6um
Classes start in two weeks for me.
13I have no idea, but when the download was about 70% complete it suddenly cancelled itself and some kind of "unexpected error" came up
13I raged
13D:
6hmm
6let me try something for you
13I'd waited about 3 hours for it too LOL
Definitely A, I'd say.
but I don't make the rules
Yeah, looks like A.

Sure.
Or you going to take the day off since I heard you were on vacations for the weekend?)
Nah, I was climbing a mountain.
ooh, nice.
I couldn't climb the other mountain, forgot I had something to do on Monday.
13'Kay I'll let that download in the background, and apparently it's not gonna take 2/3 hours to download this time
something came up
13I was probably just given a dodgy/incomplete copy or something |D
Monday stream?
/me 7meeps.
Yeah the monday stream
Oh yeah.
03LOL suggestive comments on GSN
argh, wish I could be here for that
03now, if it just didn't work I wouldn't mind
03but
Ahhhh
03it has a safety feature built in that if it detects a problem it BEEPS VERY LOUDLY
03s7o I can't use my desktop without pissing off the entire house
Hi Dari
Hey Barry.
03and it does that constantly >_>
motherboard?
03no
03CPU cooler.
03it's actually a really nice unit when it works
03called the ChillTEC, by Ultra Products
But it apparently didn't last
actually, a Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann marathon would be insanely fun.
6that and yoshika reviving herself by EATING THOSE SOULS
6is annoying D:
13I haaaate that LOL
13Then when she laughs at me for failing to capture the spellcard
13.-.
/me group hugs-
6see
6I stopped playing
6so I could do toher things and play other touhou ames
6games
6cuz I forgot EVERYTHING lol
Hello guys
04jebus
04was that really necessary
13such as running into the boss's head/body/whatever multiple times
6but you made it to the last stage already
13and running into fairies that aren't even moving
13|D
6granted
6I've played it all of 5 times
6and yeah
I found the best gif of all time
6I've done that
http://i.imgur.com/rrVTa.gif
6my worst failure is watching a bullet
6I did a circle around the bullet
lawl wut
DERP
13LOL
Heh. "Authentic frontier gibberish."
6so I hit it
Derpy accidentally all the animals :(
lolno
6same
Ashes.
6...
oh
6I just figured out how to use the trance state
6I could never understand how people used it without getting hit
Stream's up.
13LOL I looked it up on the wiki soon after the demo came out :P
Nothing yet.
6I never really thought about it being used whenever
13Still, I'm terrible at knowing the best times to use it
6until I saw it on the live stream
6just now I actually thought HMM I BET THAT WOULD BE USEFUL
6looked it up
6and voila
13They make me want to take risks and go get them even when the screen is full of bullets
...as would Torchwood, really
13then I die for being reckless about it .-.
DO IT
oh, forgot to turn on sound, lol
6but I have this thing
6where I REALLY want to collect ALL THE THINGS
6and that's wat kills me
6and i still seem to be scared to use my bombs lol
6even though it's gone back to bomb counter, not power base
wat
DAAAAAAAW
but was she wearing socks?
glasses
13Well it DOES make you feel helpless and panicky when you're about to die
Dramatic reading of Spiderses?
13|D
lol I'd get behind the Spiderses thing
6but now it's like we have two kinds of bombs
no thanks, self-reading Spiderses was too amazing as it is. i'd die if someone read it to me
6I'll be honest, I'm not as attached to these characters as the other games (minus UFO as I don't care for the characters in there much lol)
The Spiderses was THAT amazing
oh Twilight is Sad movie? such a sad thing
Turn it up
Sad Movie = Grave of the Fireflies
13Yeah I don't really feel much for these characters at the moment
13But Toyosa
13is <3
6toyosaaaaaa
poor spike
13Also, stage 4 boss makes me think she's too scared/weak to fight by herself
13Can't remember he name yet |D
13*her
6seiga <3
6I actually do like her
13And I keep yelling at Yoshika to get out the way D:
Grave of the Fireflies starts off sad, and never really stops being sad.
6while i wish she'd fight on her own
Q_Q
6it's beautiful danmaku when she revives yoshika
Especially if you realize what's actually happening in the intro
I'll have to watch it...
Grave of the Fireflies.
never seen it
not planning on it, I don't like spoilers
13The return of curvy lasers scares me too D:
6I use the revival as my advantage
6since seiga takes a huge moment of doing nothing
13True, but still makes me go ASDFGHJ when the revival actually happens xD
and by someone, I mean anyone but me, basically.
there are tons of Magic the Gathering pony cards
6I havent used her
6marisa and youmu are my mains
6youmu primarily
6because FOCUSSLASH WOOOOOOT
I have this song stuck in my head still ><

No daleks?

Inconceivable!
The executives didn't think the daleks looked high-tech enough for the series
...weird
03well this is the old version from before they had flat panels. but still LOL
Lol.
That would have sucked.
yeah
Desks are boring :p
It stops on "waiting for veemi.com"
03WTF?
Pfffffft, Daleks don't need to look hi-tech. They just need to be threatening.
Or the desks were hollow
03Couch was the #1 answer
03WHAT THE FRICK PEOPLE
EXTERMINATE!
LOLWUT
I guess routing problem. :(
03How hard is it to move a couch

03which would cost a lot of money
03as advertisers pay per the 30-second spot

nice!
9is dari streaming?
yeah
Torchwood
9oic
/me goes to look at comic
After this episode, sure.
9also dari
9apparently the room has
9a 200 user cap
9we couldn't get any more in
9this one
...
It doesn't.
9dari, we proved it on-site
we couldn't get more than 200 people in there
We've had more than that in before.
9we got "connection refused by configuration"
Also, it doesn't.
Yeah, we had people timing out and being denied entry like crazy.
9maybe it was set by accident man?
9you should look into it
It isn't on.
And hasn't ever been on.
9well
9something was denying entrance here
9and we couldn't get more than 200 users
well in battle
Now it's on.
9so we still got to look into it
Oh.
ChanServ turns it off automatically.
You can't even limit the users.
No idea.
9it didn't let us have more than 200 users
Only thing I can think of is someone changed a network configuration.
9maybe we should migrate servers again? dragonite has been giving us a fair share of problems
LOLwhat
Well we could think about our own network.
I've got one set up.
9we should probably do that
9but still
9it's great to have you back
Hmm.
I can't think of why it would limit to 200 users.
9dari, maybe we should move to an established IRC Server instead?
9one that can handle the load
9because I know that if I'm streaming
03<junh1024> who's that dude?
03> it was a campaign speech, not?
03* azrael (a@p3EE2C126.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #pokemon-originals
03<bluesun> o
03<usotsuki> yeah, something like that
Well we can switch if you want.
I think it's a problem with mibbit though.
(i was using chatzilla)
I've never been DCed by the server when using mIRC.
9Ziltoid: that's the plan but we need to have rooms with variable user limits yet
9*first
I've had my connection to the server drop randomly at times. Can't confirm whether it was the server that was at fault, or my connection though.
Lol
dat baby
And the nronystate take over would begin
9Ziltoid: as I said, that's the plan, but let's say we make 6 rooms for 300 viewers each
THIS IS HORRIFYING
9if those fill out
9we're going to need to raise the cap a bit
Since it's not really the same when you're splitting everyone up.
>program
lol
Yeah, yeah...
Implying mibbit is actually a program
Fingers were typing faster than brain was thinking.
9wait
9Dari
?
trolololol
OH SHIT
9whydon't we combi-YOU DON GOUFD
good thing he is in a hospital
good place to be dying, really
9but yeah
9we should probably combine both concepts

Well
/me dies
most of the bNCs
aren't connected
still having issues
Goodbye, American Woman
i know
did you fuck over databases or something?
10.0.1.40 as server is the only thing that works
well
That's because it's a local DNS server
lol
.________________________________________.

I do, thank you for making it for me :3

derp
._.
pie
streets of RAEG wut
Can somebody please type the word pie?
oops
I crashed the server
shiiiiiiit
I hope Altair's still on
12pie
Fuck sake -.-
Apparently restarting the network server
-_-
yes
derp@(none):~$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
Running /etc/init.d/networking restart is deprecated because it may not enable again some interfaces ... (warning).
Reconfiguring network interfaces...SIOCDELRT: No such process
i need to wipe that init script
Services down?
whole fucking thing is down
yes
._.
dhclient eth0
is all it needs
well
Gtg, bye er'body =d
the issue is
need to add that to boot as well
to fix it on start
it's not running properly
I need to refresh /etc/resolv.conf
after editing it to use the local bind9 server
Any other way to do it?
it's either typed up in a config somewhere to use 192.x
unlikely
or
it's cached
and no
i can't even ping it locally
It just died
i know
It probably froze
i got dc'd
and using 100% or something
from ssh lol
yeah
no
just net
weird
hm
i know
lol...
Looks like something is fucking up after that happens
that script is fucked up
any idea why?
Yeah
i need to modify it
it uses cached dhcp info
i think
it doesn't run dhclient
on that script's start
That's weird
i know
also the bind9 server doesn't seem to be starting by default anymore
I have to manually /etc/init.d/bind9 start
i'll write another script tomorrow
maybe
hopefully
also
._____.
d'you have a temp fix?
update-rc.d
to addit
eh?
not atm
sigh
Well
to add a script to boot time
All it needs really
update-rc.d bind9 default
is resolv.conf edited
ok cya
D:
nuuuu
can you start the server-
>:
damnit
backup services
12night all~
I fucked Altair's server again
04At least TELL me.

/me hides
lmfao
with Reminiscence ch24
04Yaaaay
0420 pages and 11000 words
._.
that long?
04Yep.
even mine for Reminiscence wasn't that long
04Way too much detail but oh well
then again mine was just summaries
04Mine's longer. It's basically a dummied-down chapter summary
heh
04Each paragraph is a chapter, roughly
still not as long as Defeat
:p
04Reaching 25+ chapters
TCTL is 31 chapters
lmfao
defeat sucked
and 4915 for all the Reminiscence chapters
not including the sequel because I haven't done that yet
04XD
I just can't wait
04XD
until I finish Reminiscence
but still
it's exciting to finally finish
the Epilogue is going to be awesome
lmfao
I should totally have him
wear a monocle
in the sequel
then I would lol every time he sees it
and then be like
04Heckyes
04and a pimp cane
/me flees

04so he can go 'Gentlement'
04Gentlemen*

04Mine lasts 3 quarters of an hour.
04FML

lmfao
well yeah
04But...cigars!
I don't think he'll be smokin' cigars or monocl'ng 'round the place
XD
and yeah
The Hensh calls Kommander Kulesz sentimental
xD
04...LOL
.o.
The Hensh chuckled, but it quickly turned into a pained cough. "You know, you are getting quite sentimental..."
04I don't know whether to laugh or cry
04He's dying
XD
they all make some sort of humourous jibe
04...Awww
