No more.
like, no amount of your Caramel trolling could repel me if you streamed it
BABY DON'T HURT ME
9igl: SOMETHING I REMEMBER
9once
DON'T EAT THE MUSHROOM
9THERE WAS A WAR
now, i watch ponies...have i reverse aged?
oh gundam it!
yes
yeah
04^
Soo?
GUNDAM X
03^
vandred is great
Woo Gundam!
I don't think I've seen Gundam X
I've seen a lot of the stuff in the first war.
lol
So, they colonies are hitting the earth for massive damage?
GUNDAM WING= BEST GUNDAM
miss old Gundam
interior_gummy: You've grown fully to adulthood. You like something and are not ashamed about who it's aimed at.
The original series, and 08th MS Team.
9>Gundam Wing
Gundam Seed ruined it for me
9>Best Gundam
08th MS Team is the best Gundam. :|
9dude, Wing was bland as fuck
the evil women that will eat your organs
i wonder how much i could sell an autograph from the creator of gundam for. i'm broke and out of work.
Wing was emo as fuck
Never seen Gundam X before. which setting is it set in
9also X is the Gundam series they made RIGHT after Wing
TROWA WAS COOL THO
9that said
i must confess: i never really watched gundam before
COME FORTH, POWER OF LUNA!
why would i be ashamed about watching a show that burns of man?
I don't remember anything story wise, but design wise Talgeese and its three forms were the most epic robots ever
9Gundaw Wing EW: Frozen Teardrop seems REALLY fucking interesting to me, though.
7I think I'd rather keep my real identity away from a place where anything is available to anyone.
only mecha series i watched and liked were TTGL and code geass
that will learn those space colonys
6well
9it's the sequel novel that's currently in serialization
6tbh
9give me amoment
Code Geass kinda sucks
THIS ISNT GIANT ROBOTS BUT EVER SEEN GANTZ?
6if someone really wanted to know
6they'd fins out
6find
03\
6that aside though
03^
03I wasn't asking for names and faces :P
9DAT CALLBACK TO THE END OF FIRST GUNDAM
How can anybody tell your real identity by your sisters/names
.v.
9I used to read Gantz
03^
I mean
Family
Any1 ever read Berserk
This is the second show that involves the utter destruction of Earth
I LOVE GANTZ
04Quite easily @HML
...So, japan really likes killing off the 10 people of earth...
Not names, they're everything
cue techno
I take it this isn't a Universal century series
Gundam X is apparently in the After War era.
9Geass wasn't "good" but it sure as hell was "entertaining"
03if you go
No, not Universal Century.
03I have two sisters
Ya that true DCD
I've only watched Mobile Fighter G Gundam
lol
6I see Topaz here.
9also
03OH MY GOD I'M GOING TO STALK YOU FROM THAT INFO
03</sarcasm>
delayed kick is delayed
he has no arms
9After War: pretty much an alternate UC
03so yeah, kinda a bogus argument :P
sprinkles is practically anarchist compared to celestia
7Yeaaaaaaaaaah, you won't change my mind.
04I mean, May found my Facebook profile because she knew both my name and email.
NewDCD you are weird
THE LIVE ACTION MOVIE OF GANTZ WAS DISSAPOINTING THO
04It was scary.
9but yeah
Fuck arms, who needs them?
code geass is fucking deep
03and knowing that
9Frozen Teardrop seems REALLY interesting http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/New_Mobile_Report_Gundam_Wing:_Frozen_Teardrop
03I'm going to stalk May's profile and find yours :)
/me runs
The difference is this is basically what UC would have been if the colonists carpet colony dropped the whole planet.
its not really that deep
04XD
I make a habit of covering up my tracks
Apparently.
03solution: Just give out your profile.
I NEVER WATCHED ALL OF CODE GEASS
03Save people the trouble
03:)
I did. It was... well.
04I've gotten relaxed in my efforts to hide my identity
WELP
03so have I LOL
9and if you liked Wing you should probably read Glory of Losers http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/New_Mobile_Report_Gundam_Wing_Endless_Waltz:_The_Glory_of_Losers
no
dose tv trope even have an entry for that, the carpet colony drop?
03I give out my real name all the time now
04It's not really worth it when I'm not doing anything I'm ashamed of
HOLD ON, LET ME CHECK...
YEP, IT"S OUT
Suzaku is a character i really hate
NewDCD = I actually though the first 25% of Code Geass was genuinely enthralling. It went south really fast though
I dunno. But you can see ALL THE CRATERS it made
6I'd say I'm relaxed
MY FAV ANIMES ARE ELFEN LIED, GANTZ, AND DEATH NOTE
6but I don't advertise everything about me
04I always used to think (and thanks to NS for hammering it into me) that I needed to hide everything about me.
1st season 5 Code Geass was good
ffff Elfen Lied
9Riders: same here...but then it became "B-Movie Interesting"
Earth got fucked up
not Baja califorina!
7Well, do you guys know my real name? :P
2nd eh
6as for my name, that is one thing I still keep wrapped, you'll only know my online name
9but yeah
I read the manga and wanted to kill myself.
04Nope @Quan
9Wing sequel up there
6unless you happen to know my real name by tracking, in which case that's fine
9it's canon
OH SHIT TWO-HEADED SNAKE
IS THIS FALLOUT?
yes
Basically
Yesss
7:O
6ok well a LOT of people know my real first name
Fallout needs an anime :V
04give*
Or maybe not
6but drf is one of the few people who knows my full name lol
9Gundam X

all the survivors were japanese
COWBOY BEBEOP?
9basically Gundam meets Fallout
yes love the soundtrack
HE'S JUST POSING AS A GIRL
04XD
George Bush?
03because I swear you linked it once
I MISS OUTLAW STAR
03saying something about how they wouldnt'believe your name was actually your name
03LOL
7Nope.
NewDCD = It was like V for Vendetta with Mecha. Than it got fascinatingly stupid
drake
Outlaw Star was fun
Outlaw Star was awesome
04?
03...
03so you used a fake name on there?
I already know your name anyway
03actually
dat effective wall
03You sent me a screenshot once which I think gave away your name :P
OH NO THE FIENDS
I USE TO WATCH IT ON TOONAMI ALOT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
SD Gundam any1
04because I used my school email to register on TST, which was a stupid decision
QUICK CALL THE NCR
lol
MISS TOONAMI
how does a fucking mech sneak up on you?
not tst
What I remember from Outlaw Star was that for the first two-thirds of the show, it was awesome.
And they diiiiied
Then it got trippy and rushed and stopped making any sense.
red twin smears
7Screenshot? o.O
and no
I HAD A BEAST FIGURE OF JEAN
I meant IRK

Awesome mom has an anti-tank rifle
I never did like how raiders would level up with you
9OHAI BEST GUNDAM PILOT
04no durr

7The only actual screenshot I linked of me is my hand. X3
and oh god
hey man, didn't you learn from ff13?
moms are tough
the baby is crying
Just seemed to make things too crazy at high levels
7But there are pictures of me on the internet elsewhere.

I have a half-brother now
lol
FUCK YOU I'M KID BATMAN
;-;
9seriously
Watch as I jack this suit with a BOTTLE OF WATER AND A GRAPPEL GUN
Does his zaku have a matching mohawk?
03I don't actually have the picture saved since I'm actually not a stalker, contrary to popular belief
03:P
9Garrod is pretty much the only other Gundam pilot who isn't Judau or Domon that isn't emo
9AND THAT'S WHY HE'S AWESOME
7Computer issue?
Purp: That was a flash grenade
7What was it, exactly?
flash grenade
BEAT HIS ASS
uh oh
NAILBATS
H
E
HELP ME
LYNCH LYNCH
Oh damn his zaku doesn't have a mohawk.
03this was like a year ago, I don't really remember
That would have been hilarious.
9seriously
KNOW GIVE ME YOU'RE MONEY
*NOW
9he's the least emo Gundam protagonist
bits?
Cool, I have a free giant robot now
04Oh
04NS
?
DCD: Thank god.
04My friends think you're cool
04Just saying.
7The story doesn't sound familiar.
._.
9hence why Gundam X is best Gundam to me
9the lack of emo
Why doesn't Quan share her pics with us
:p
03^
/me runs
lack of emo is always good
9just everything that's good about Gundam with none of the emo
huh
WHICH GUNDAM IS THIS? X?
does the first gundam count as emo?
!check lugia.us
It's just you. http://lugia.us is up.
NewDCD = That's pretty damn sad.
oh nv

04drf
04I'm the one with the pictures
my internet here sucks
This kid knows his shit
03Drake give me some

03Quan sent me a jpg screenshot of something
6oh
9they recently announced an animated adaptation of Gundam: The Origin

Yes, we know.
6you also did a fix on my computer and my name was there

03yes
03well first and last
This is why I don't have facebook ;)
orly
7Well, glad that my identity's still relatively anonymous.
9OH HEY JAMIL HOW IS BEING A BADASS TREATING YOU.
And there was this one PS2 RPG, that was fun.
Original or Rebuild?
Captain sunglasses
SG GUNDAM DRAGORAGE?
People complain when others find out stuff PP
/me hides
9Rebuild is okay
9Original was good but it's overrated
I KNOW
Yeah.
no the fact they constantly remake it and stuff
MY LIL BRO LIKED THAT ONE
# Law of Technological User-Benevolence (from Tom Williams) The formal training required to operate a spaceship or mecha is inversely proportional to its complexity.
What about Altair? :p

Ah right
It's only been 10 mins and I love this series!
9but yeah
OH HI LUNA
9this is my favorite Gundam series
03anyway yeah back when my memory sucked I actually had a text file with a bunch of TST regulars' real names so I could remember
9at least traditional Gundam
03I still have it but it's old as frick
03there are people there who haven't even joined in years
._.
9METAL GEAR GARROD
08th MS Team is my favorite. I like the 'average grunt' perspective it has.
Original blows its load after 75% in. Rebuild is looking to be much better
Do you know my name?
9 08th was pretty good
03yes
I'm pretty sure you saw that YT video
yeah
Remember Garrod, this is a sneaking mission
heya May

May's called me that for like
04I know
a month or something
04Because I told her
Metal gear 4 was a great movie
04about that story
9Obs: but Shiro is fucking awesome man
14no I didn't lol
9who needs to be a newtype
Well I told her about it first :p
naw 3 was the greatest for me
9when you have the voice of Viral and the King of Braves
14yes, she did
She asked me about the note on your profile
personally cause I like Big Boss more than Solid Snake
04Oh
so derp
9they were actually very rare mass production models
04I thought she asked me first
Drake got pwned!
04Oh well
9not really "mass production"
9more like
ahem
14anyways, it's not my fault that he gets overly excited

14can't believe you didn't figure that out sooner
Gotta watch Gundam X, definitely.
Then bed...

9CHIKARA O
6ALSO HI
No.
9but yeah
scratch that, I mean 4:30am EST
It's a weapons grade marathon
9I LOVE the episode naming in this series.
we need Pinkie PIe to sing RnB
I'm playing Sim City 2000
but haha, that pic made my day
(On a ps1 emulator)
:p
Anata hahaha women talk
Use a real PS2/PS1 :<
remember-all you have to do is laugh
That's rich, coming from you
12 Hello, mib_wx15rl and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
and heh
I know
my PS1 still exists
IT'S AMAZING
9it's probably one of the most original episode naming dynamics I've ever seen, and worthy of mention
7Hmm.
14oh my gosh
14Rhy
I see they are doing bleach lignth recaps
14elvarg72 		[Oct 17, 2010 at 03:04 PM]
14*has trouble thinking of a comment* hmmm i'll come back later, fave<3 5/5 k i'm back.
14in my oppion you did a fantastic job on this photo and i really like it.
14i wouldn't mind having this as my desk-top backround if that is ok with you.
14I LAUGHED
LOLWut
14SO DAMN HARD
04...LOL
any1 ever watched Ran
It's an easy way to save on the budget
w
Yeah May, so damn hard
9actually
YAY
14yep
04...XD
14and it's waiting for you too
best one, imo
so why gundam x? =p
9they sold bootleg toys of GX in a store near here when I was just a small child
is
9it always broke
9but
9I loved it so much
dat animatio
7Yanno that person is Insane Lugia?
*animation
9I bought it like 4 or 5 times
Typical
Back, hope I didn't miss anything :O
9the GX is a mech linked to my heart
just the recap
i always wanted a gundam model when i was young
9I was like 10
Cool
04Between you guys I bet you could turn #SW into a copy of how #True-Flame is.
you missed hot robot-on-SirSprinkles action
I'm guessing the other Gundam pilots eventually join the protagonist?
but in Japan everythin is expensive XP
14...ha
...scary thought
04Seriously. The amount of innuendo you two share is beyond me.
nolstalgia huh DCD
7Poor newcomers.
I HAD TOYS OF ALL THE CHARACTERS IN GUNDAM WING
9also, why Gundam X? Because it's all of the best from Gundam without the emo and suckish.
Hey, this a lot like that Cartoon Network block from the early 2000s that showed all those action shows and anime when Adult Swim dissappeared on weekends. It ran late too, I think about 2:00 AM
my mind already blown
That sounds like my experience with the Transformers rebrand of the macross veritech.
04?
And Drake, been there and done that
my thing was macross. I still have the diecast ones.
12?
03LOL @ Facebook telling me to add random japanese girls I don't know or even have any mutual friends with.
TOONAMI WAS THE BEST
That one guy looks kind of like larry butz.
I owned like 4 of them over the years
wat
04wat
just post them on /b/
Fun stuff
14wait
... Roybea? Witz?
and I cobbled together a basically complete toy from them
14how does this blow your mind
9see? FUNCTIONAL!
These names are silly.
04^
NewDCD should totally find the Toonami Gaint Robot Commercial and show it
12^
Yay!
you know wats awsome Hellsing manga
WHY R THEY FIGHTING HIM?
14that's all I noticed
I love PS1
7I am curious about your stance on TST.
good idea Crono
9I TOLD YOU
9BEST GUNDAM PROTAGONIST
lolThatBluff
ARENT THEY GOOD GUYS?
7But that's for me to analyze and for you to become confused over.
14oh, my stance on TST is on a rock
14over there
04Who is that aimed at Quan?
awesome bluff
NOPE
^
hahaha
Fail bluff is fail.
12You have a corrupt mind NS XD
/me runs
is it realy a bluff thought?
DAT_PON-3 = It wasn't Toonami. Toonami had went on hiatus around this time
14IKNOW
14HAHA
You /just/ realised?
I like these people already
9>Sala
9>not Sarah
<May> how does this blow your mind
I'm taking it a bit too wrongly
I STILL MISS IT
lets make Adeel!
7That was at NS.
14...you are
14come one
The position of the Lugia...
14*on
9too bad you can't get those anymore
04...
12LOL
04no
I REMEMBER WHEN I GOT HOME FROM SCHOOL SAILOR MOON THEN DBZ EVERYDAY
"stance"?
DAT_PON-3 THOSE WHERE THE DAYS
oh ya cool wings
Smart pilot is SMART
*nostalgia*
7Position is a proper synonym.
gotcha
its a gunjet
I'd rather hold the King of Hearts. Because its loud roar would tell me to defeat you.
/me runs
oh come on, you know I'm not being serious
14...lol
Man, I recognize too many Japanese VAs in anime these days.
awwww
BELIEVEEEE IN YOUUUU.
SRS BSNZ!
good thing for autopiolt eh?
Garrod's a little badass
FALL FOR THE CHICK WITH THE 1000 YARD SOULESS STARE
Fucking Zoro.

9yeah crono
9Hero Legends can't be gotten anymore

Stream's working fine for me. It froze a few times but never for long or permanently
lol
WHAT I MISS?
Stream's working for me
And my internet is shit.
oh the streem, all good here
1am here
So that's a good thing.
stream's flipping gorgeous for me
Seriously, I've had streams with much worse quality freeze on me constantly.
Yeah.
blid people cant see pictures you fool
This is basically perfect quality.
damn those two are blind
so any1 else has Hub
I do
I do
I do, but not in my room
yes
I have hub
Nope
Hub?
arrata
the Hub channel
Cable network that shows MlP
oh
Nope
among other things
9another reason Garrod is best pilot
So Garrod is 15 years old
CELESTIA GOT LAZY THATS WHY
yeah but knowing the croud here that seems the best way to discribe it.
THERE WAS NO SUN
9he probably had it worse than most other pilots, but he's not emo
i have the hub, evidently it replaced discovery kids
wat a man
Die and reborn.
disc kids got moved up in to the 1k range here
Garrod is basically Dick Grayson
oh ya
except instead of Batman, he has a giant robot
9Purple'Prose: I love that comparison
WHOA
*glomp*
EWW
i found the treasure 2
TACTICAL HORNS

Poor Garrod the Stampede

HE HATES MONDAYS
I loved watching this every Saturday when it was still on AS
Sounds like somebody's having a bad case of the mondays.
Everyone hates monday
FreezeFrame = That's the pronunciation of the series name. I don't know why they felt the need to do that but it is what it is
brace for 50+ eps of random shit.
Wait, so its been 15 years?

I LOVE FLCL
Oh hi Eureka 7

any1 ever saw the pic of Scootaloo on a vespa wit a guitar
MUSHROOM
Fooly Scooty
I HAVE IT AS MY BACKGROUNG
I saw that pic
Oh look, asshole fellow students
SCOOTALOO ON THE VESPA
PWNED
9Scootaloo Thurston
Renton, you will go blind if you keep doing that
Jelly people are jelly.
I like the entire mid-section of this show. The beginning and ending are a chore to get through
THAT HIS DAD?
the early episodes, i hated this show. renton is the whinest kid in any anime ever. he makes senji from eva look like chuck norris. but by the end of the series i was like "best show ever!" /)^ɛ^(\﻿
Sister I think
9well, Renton isn't emo like Shinji
Oh hey a green glowing thing powered by emotion?
WHERE HAVE I SEEN THAT BEFORE
9and Eureka 7 is pretty much a story about coming of AGE
yeah he is his own kind of emo
I MEAN THE DUDE ON THE MAGAZINE
Renton is Scootaloo, and Holland is Rainbow Dash
hay
9So yeah
9the whole story is about Renton growing
EVANGELION WAS SO WEIRD
awwwwwwww
IRRELEVANT
That is a badass grandpa

THIS
THIS SUCKS I'M GONNA GO CRAWLING IN MY SKIN
hot dam
CREEPING IN MY SOUL
don't worry. he gets emo.
ABOUT SKY SURFING AND ROBOTS I GUESS
Renton is whiny but at least he's realistically whiny and gets better. Shinji is just a spineless unlikeable shit from beginning to end
SLAP HIM
He's having a very bad monday
o_O
His life sucks I gather
I like this kid :P
wen is the my little pony starting
?
Huh

I HATE WHINING TEENS
None tonight

Is that porno I see on his wall?
9Riders: unless it's SRW Shinji, who became badass enough to reject instrumentality out of sheer willpower.
Looks like the server itself went down but Altair's connection is still up
MLP was yesterday. >_>
LIKE HOPE IN FF 13 GOD I WANTED TO KILL HIM

desertman2 and NewDCD = agreed
you shold play it everyday
probably CPU and fan going insane
will just have to wait for Altair to get home and go fuuuuuuuuu
i'm not dissing this show. i'm just saying if renton gets super annoying just suffer though it. totally worth it.
o ya cynical old guy
9but yeah, it's just that our amount of "pony" is limited

Actually, there's no way in IRC to remove color ability from non-mods but keep it for mods
Make them all disappear!
I wish I knew the context of that line, but I went to grab my pizza and came back to that scene.

The mods could just use scripts instead.

Dat 70s beat
I was poking around online and there seem to be several torrents of them out there.

That was just the build up to the credits
So, yeah, the explanation for basically everything they do is 'gravity'.
GRAVITY
So it explains why blondie can stand up too.
Yup
GRAVITY POWERS
Half the credit song was spent staring at a sword
That or helium
COULDNT WE HAVE JUST WATCHED THAT IN ENGLISH?
Stelvia, was another good anime the red space reminded me of it

I still think that billionaire is an asshole...I hope he dies in an incredibly painful and embarassing way
like being slowly melted by a semi-weak laser while he's sitting on his gold-studded toilet
IS HE A GOOD GUY OR BAD GUY?
He has plot armor
Wow, venom much?
9well it's hard to get people to believe you in the sense that GIANT ALIENS ARE COMING TO FUCK OUR SHIT UP
Calling it now
He's Sandman
XD
so just how long have they been stareing at each other?
he still could have been like: "Hey military, here's some weapons that wont make you a bunch of useless pussies"
Mr. Sandman.
it was night in the last ep
... actually, nah.
I ain't calling him that anymore.

"Is this for real" The response everyone watching should be having
power and beauty really
nice carrier, looks like the ones from 00
Prepare to fire the cannons
This guy isn't cool enough to be Mr. Sandman.
Val: And then they'd be like 'this shit's too expensive we aren't making any of it'
Now, if he were a seven foot tall boxer?
this anime is a really weird mix of Giant robot genres
That would be something else.
Be careful it's barely articulated!
the animation kinda reminds me of hentai

Roger doesn't carry weapons.
No, but his car does
His CAR does.
why did he need a decoy?
And now the batmobile.
So they wouldn't notice this

not like they knew his car was the batmoble
9he's a louse.

Best. Cockpit. EVER
ACTION!
Oh ya
broke the tardis
Oh man I got goosebumps. I love this show
I was just thinking that Sumica
Y'know, piloting a giant mecha would probably be absurdly complicated in real life.
man...the police must hate this man
Hi Aurora
talk about getting your beauty sleep
I take back all the bad things I ever said about anime
i need to go buy this series
all of them
SHOW HIM YOUR MOVES, BIG O!
wait till you see a punch
YEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS
epic punch
so much unnecessary destruction of public propert
9>avoid mech from robbing a bank
I love how the robots in this series move
They're kinda slow but in an awesome way.
turtling
9>cause more collateral damage than the money the mech would steal
It emphasizes how fucking huge they are.
They're not agile and swift, they're slow, nd ponderous and purposful
Destruction is never unnecessary
Its like boxing
dat hook
I'm envoking rule of cool, Collateral damage is irrelevant
hard to say it was stealing the printing plates
Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots.
DAT MUSIC
even roger knows tenticals are bad
I like to think of this as a Steampunk Mech anime
those punches must hurt like hell
not my type
epic punch!!!!!!!!
FALCON
GRAND PISTON!
FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE!
DIS GONNA BE GOOD
PUNCH!
awww yeah

we were both out front on the lawn, watching for shooting stars
Sumi: looool
Adds?

I walked into my room after everyone decided to retreat to their own rooms for the night

BTW, this is IRC-based? What's the address and room name for this chat?
SPOILER: Dorothy.
DragonRage uses Firefox and has Ad Block plus installed, so... no ads for me.

9I'd give it to you later
Ok
dat noir opening
9brb
dat noir monologue
eyup
Noir is the best
Whatcha think, Val?
well
bruce wayne aint got notin on this
Big 0's attack just get better and better as the show progresses
I can't help but wonder how this show would have been without the giant robots
not as cool
and made it an information dealer in a city of amnesia
I think it still would have been good.
I mean...the robots just seem...so...random? irrelevant?
kay
I'm not sure what word I'm looking for
They get less random.
Then it wouldn't be anime
Obs
More explained.
Yeah?
I mean, I'm not saying the show is bad or anything
just I can't help but wonder
they serve purpose
stop or we will anoy you
the show is a mystery
it is noir
*SMUG*
annnnnnd down into thw ground
Suddenly, express elevator!
that train is sweet
U Mad
and there goes the city's irrigation system

Hey Obs
Heya
I'll log out the other one then
12i'm sorry

12i just can't think straight, my head is in such a tangle from everything that has been going on
6...I want those eyebrows.
Best. Office. Ever.
So many hourglasses

6something wrong, bree?
the animation of this show kinda reminds me of that batman series
9that's the joke
lol
alot of the animation team were the same people
That's the point
12you can say that.
i know but i now just notice it like sometimes it seems uncanny
nice neck
Oh god a potato monster- oh wait
6D:
/me 6hugs
12it's kind of frustrating
im roger smith bitch move yo ass
12i like to pride myself on how level headed i am
6thats good
cuz i said so
out-smugged
Roger, you were just told you couldn't go in.
"Bitch, don't make me bring out my giant fucking robot"
Why would you think that changed in the past twenty seconds?
U Mad Roger
12i usually keep my emotions on a tight tight leash, it's embarassing that i even allowed myself to feel anywhere near this bad
all that music from one key
her voice sounds like a piano
9Proto-Vocaloid
Sumica, It's anime, I ain't gotta explain shut
dorothy will always be better than miku
i hate miku
9of course

IT DOES HAVE A HOLE IN IT
BIG O! AND ACTION!
ACTION
THAT MAY CAUSE ISSUES
Exactly. They're gonna 'find' that guy piloting it.

...and they don't suspect the rich guy who keeps popping out of the debris where it leaves?
It's in that topic
that line is so wrong now, thanks
lol
we've all been there
Mega Deuce sounds wrong.
6umbreon, yeah, assuming I read that sentence correctly
Well, the giant robots are called Megadei, or Megadeus for the singular
They don't expect the guy that shows up right when Batman swings off?
12rephrase it then
Deus is suppose to be god in latin i think
indeed
when does bruce waynce ever do that?
6a friend decides to end their friendship with you abruptly
Mega God
i seen enuf hentai
again
WUT A DICK
12in simple words, yes
Val: He does it sometimes. And he's rich enough for all the cool toys!
hentai is funny
I've never seen Bruce Wayne do that
12multiple friends
like, ever
that face
ACTING!
Eh.
yup i know where this is goin
6yeah
Whatever. Drill.
Drill, Heavens, Etc
6I had a couple of friends decide that I was a horrible person
12it's like they never talk to me, i'm lucky if i can get a "." reply out of them
6which...seems to be a running theme with people
6I don't know why
todler in the mall attack go!
04YOU'RE A HORRIBLE PERSON AURORA. I HATE YOU.
12then the last time i tried talking one of them all i got was a "leave me alone"
/me idles again
12i had to do something extremely drastic to even get their attention again
wrist watch
...he really IS batman. >__>
04o_O
Grappling watch.
Yes he is
why does he care about this android?
12no brees were harmed
I think breaking it is a much faster solution...
6drake
Because she asked him for help
6people are just unreasonable sometimes
It's his current job
12Drake
6irrational
9that guy is a dick
12that's what makes it more painful
12i don't know
6it's quite painf-
9and yet he's a playable character in SRW
04It is conpletely illogical.
as you watch the show she shows a bit more emotions
Who, Beck?
04Also stupid.
Rodger is strong to jum while holding her
12indeed it is spock
04/noactualadvice
9yeah, Beck
That's what every girl wants to hear
12i admit
9OHAI BECK
Hi
eyup
two inspector gadgets?
12that i have done... things with questionable intent to friends in the past
SHUT THE DOORS
TURN OFF THE LIGHTS
ACT LIKE WE ARENT HOME
If you shut the door on the giant robot, it can't get you.
04As everyone has.
12but that was over a year ago when i did that
punch it
12i have completely matured and redoubled my efforts to make sure that mood never happened again
6was that related to this current event?
wow they should be dead
beast
12i don't know
12this is me digging really deep to try finding a reason
6shall I rephrase
Low power pressure punch
or at least bruised...
dat harmonica
6is it the same group of people involved in the last one?
such a bebop ending
12that phase i was in over a year ago
eyup
12i lost like 6-7 friends
dat pillowhead
see ya space cowboy
12and slowly regained back most of them
12so yes
classy
ah 4get it
Dorothy looks cute in ithat
you have to go DEEPER
... he has the name "Wayne" in his own name. I just realized that.
/me is unusually dense today, I guess.
The Roger Smith method of investigation: Who gives a shit
12i understand that respect is easy to lose and hard to gain but it's been over a freaking year since i did that
love this part
9RULE OF BLACK
...huh
Snark
6well
12why does the past haunt people and imprison them
Welcome to the team Robin
it's dean
Roger Smith sees a red door and wants it painted black.
6depending on the person, it's poosible to hold grudges
...Joke?
ITS ROGER SMITH YOUR ARGUMENT IS INVALID
6I'm not sure why people hate me so much, but I do know I hold grudges against them for it
6which probably adds fuel to the fire
Next, the BEST SHOW EVER
6and I hold grudges for ages
12well one of them
i think Dorothy is a bit more human than we think
This isn't?
that was...interesting to say the least
Indeed
12i know is avoiding me because they are in an even worse depression than i'm in right now
Big O is like black coffee
Who digs giant robots?
YOU DIG GIANT ROBOTS!!
04well
Chicks!
12like the super bad kind that needs medication
04You can't blame them for that.
I DIG GIANT ROBOTS!
04But the others?
WE DIG GIANT ROBOTS!
12the other i heard was kind of scared of me
CHICKS DIG GIANT ROBOTS!
NICE!
12because he's the ex of my ex
anything next?
i dig giant robots. they're far out.
megas
Megas XLR
Megas xlr
wow really
AND NOW FOR SOMETHING
Yes
9brb
EPIC
9gotta fix the stream
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/bac30d0abf7db05d02a4bd1ae358394b/4665 - megas_xlr parody pinkie_pie.png
12however that doesn't fully explain that behavior suddenly happening
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
havent seen that in forever
What the fuck.
12the last one i haven't a clue
Offline what
you gotta find first gear
I'd use that button.
9we're live again
Still want to see coops head smash the red button attack in SRW
in your giant robot car
04:/
/me 6hugs
You're sense of fasion, Pinkie, It's obnoxious
6this could just be my horribly obnoxious optimism
12the last i've literally known for years
6but there's a bunch of us who are always here for you
THERE. Finally.
This specific copy looks oddly familiar
Megas XLR: The only mecha anime (heh) I like.
Thought it was gonna crap out on me right when we got to my favorite.
ooh what's this?
6I guess I can't really speak for anyone else but myself, but I still stand by that
It's not anime, technically.
Megas XLR
Megas XLR
DAT OLD SCHOOL LOGO
12thx
basically, a giant parody of robot anime
This is the only show I've seen before
12i really wish i knew the nature of the situation though
12so i knew how to act accordingly
hell ie paridoys anime all togethere at times
of all of the ones shown tonight.
12right now making a move is just a wild stab in the dark
The Glorft units make me think of Orcs
or Orks
6there are somethings that just require you to sit back and try to forget it happened
A reminder of good days long past
6there are a lot of things that have happened to me in the dark
6er
12i might stab the issue right one
12*on
6in the past
when shows like this dissappeared i started watching less tv
Hope my stream isn't behind.
12i might stab something important
love the dmv ep
6(note to self, never read and type at the same time)
megas xlr? well look at that. time for bed.
12or i might stab just plain air and get no where
oh and the one with the powerrangers
people hold grudges for too long, Umbreon
Dat Kiva.
NewDCD, did you get this from tehparadox?
I love her voice. She needs to do more stuff.
6^
6I'm guilty of it though
6so I tend to respect grudges more than attack them
12if a grudge is truely the heart of the problem
we need mecha ponies
somehow
12it wouldn't make much sense, that mood i was in, didn't effect them in anyway
Umbreon, it's the people that are the problem, not the person
12they simply distanced themselves from me just because my mood was so bad and didn't want part of it
Nightmare Unit Twilight Sparkle reporting for duty, sir!
Just because they think you're bad doesn't mean everyone else does
... seriously, Ponies + Transformers = Awesome.
The first person to write a good mecha pony fanfic wins
yes I can imagine Twilight as Shinji
12i'm not saying i am
you know kiva's VA is also in bleach yes?
12i'm just saying at one point in the past
The past is the past
12i was in a really bad mood
let bygones be bygones
seriously
dwelling over something isn't going to help
Why not just pilot Megas?
6the past is past, that's a wonderful quote coming from you
6but that's actually quite true
haha Aurora
because they already lost
The only VA on this show that isn't in VA still is Coop's.
love this
6you of all people, I lifted my grudge on you looooong ago lol
I like how he's using an iPad
the point is it could have made the difference before when it was still helpful
It's actually an Etch-a-Sketch
well hey, we all change
That's a shame, Coop's VA is pretty good.
god Haruhi hurts my head
Yeah.
I'm not THAT much of an idiot anymore ):
6exactly
Coop's VA is playing the father on Wizards of Waverly Place.
6LOL
6well

XD
6anyways
Haruhi shall forever be known as Kiva. Or Rozalin, whomever I fancy.
12people mature
6people change
And Umbreon, if they want to be idiots, then let them stay idiots
They're not worth it
6but I think the problem with me is most people I hold grudges against, they never truly felt apologetic
haha
and Aurora, it differs
6but at the same time
6I've held grudges even then
6so I dunno
12aren't we jumping to conclusions?
most people can't accept that they're wrong
6my mind works strange, even for my own self to comprehend
Good thing they couldn't hit the broad side of a oh shit.
12like i said, i don't know anything about why this is happening
well, not most, but a lot
and black rose from .hack
6bree I'm just going on a tangent here, sorry
heh, well
12it could be as bad as them just hating my guts
12it could be as simple as they don't have time for me anymore
OH YEAH!
I'm sure Umbreon remembers when I accidentally tricked Myra into thinking THE_FLOOFINATOR was her boyfriend
She's also Faye Valentine

MEANWHILE
Drake knows
Riders: Hey yeah she is

NewDCD, that was a thing? I thought that was a random ship cannon!

12that rp was hard enough to enter in the first place
lol
12i'm not going through the stress of doing it again
dose this one have the giant robot combine or was that only the pilot?
Dat opening attack
... gah, accidentally reloaded the page.
I WONDER WHAT THAT WAS A JOKE ABOUT?
Also, I get the feeling the show's creators did not like MTV.
Also, MTV dissing
Sonic CLAP
/me 9's Random Trivia: the creators of this show got fucked by MTV. So they really hate it.
my bad
They've done us a public service
|D
SONIC BOOM
12wb D:
9they actually had a show on MTV
9before Megas
wow 2 bux
9but they cancelled it really bad
9also Goat was in that previous show
Sumica, I believe this is the only episode with combining.
NewDCD, you bet me to the Trivia
^_^
HADOKEN
HADOKEN

Head bang to the max
And nothing of value was lost
that thing is big and 8
I still can't believe the pilot is only half an hour. It feels like only yesterday that Toonami was presenting this to me as a movie.
9THE UMD?

Hello.

ohai sotha
why has nick grouping been temporarily disabled
):
12hmm
6Bjorn, you missed the SPCAroll.
Insane_Lugia no underscores needed
ohai RobotPinkie
How is your sex life?
Backup services, read only mode.
Yeah that
6Hot and steamy. You?
but why does this nick not count as registered
Australia.
how old are these back ups
:(
mind joining a channel with me?
6I see...
Possibly weeks or months
12Yuzuru, 2 hours
2 hours what
/me runs
i've had this nick grouped on here for a few days
so i call shenanigans on that.
shenanigans is fun
i'm already on ~10 channels. i think that's enough.
I have no sex life right now, girlfriend is thousands of miles away.
6Mine's in the next town... and for about two months neither of us had a job.
do some random guy/girl then?
Or you could say it's quite heavy handed trolololol
well this is weird, im connected on #elvarg72 on swiftkit and on mibbit, but i cant connect to this chat room on swiftkit.
12i count only 1 for this server D:
oh my
lol I can't just do some random girl/guy, even if I wanted to.
y
6And for clarification, I don't have a gf. It's a fwb thing.
12i'm not sure how you can be having problems
Oh no
12i managed to do it easly
12easily*
6?
maybe im not doing it right.
It's just not... happening
i think the name for #ocean.lugia.us
is confused
._.
It's a month-old
6Can't erect a dispenser?
dawww you wanna be true to your gf
6: D
12there is no #
12just ocean.lugia.us
/me attempted to quote a really bad line from a really bad movie, but ended up sparking an interesting conversation.
12# is used to indicate a channel name, ocean.lugia.us is the server
6I know sotha, I just replied to it as a joke. XD
Well kind of, I could go with that :P
some day i should look up how to emote here =p
lol
6RP, I don't know if you're replying to me or Bjorn.
REPLYCEPTION
lolol Bjornfot
=both
so we are sorta doing a pony wikiwalk using linked videos?
FLIRT NOW
12just click new server window
I'm not sure what your question was, Sprinkles
6No, I'm just playing them because they're generally good.
says your nick isnt rigistered which means i cannot join this channel unless its rigistered?
damnit sprinkles

12*is it
6Seeya PON-3
later pon-3
peace
I'm listening to the crazy Q&Neigh right now.
I totaly blame wikiwalking on how I got on this whole pony kick to start with
lol was it an impotence question, sprinkles?
6wikiwalking gets me started on a lot of things.
6Yes, RP.
6It was purely a joke, though.
12i don't remember what all the letters are x-x
It's also the cause of my messed up sleepschudule
well i get that :P
6Frankly I don't care to know.
6You have a sleep schedule?
nice ending
6I wish I had one of those.
12no it can't be because i managed to join
I use the term loosly
Chicken tenderizer
12anyway after you click new server window type in the following:
/server ocean.lugia.us
many a night I have planed on going to sleep earlyer then norm then end up on YT or TV tropes
I'm starting to kinda dislike TV Tropes
6I went on tropes for like, a week.
it's getting to the level of "lolol guy opens a door, how original"
,),
TVTropes has won the Nobel Price in Life-ruining every year
they been triming the fat over the alot lately
noticed alot of entrys are being removed.
6Nice to no, EQD Post script.
6*know
Well, hopefully that's good.

12just like ex deoxys set
12they curl up at an alarming rate
Yeah
12the black and white normal holos were doing it as well
12Ah
12now every reverse holo is going to do it now
there are some entrys on how the fandom has effected the show.
6That PMV was the summary of my Wednesday night, btw.
6I still don't know what happened.
12True
but your Wednesday night was filled with ponies?
i'm jelly
6My Wednesday night was filled with ponies, movies, alcohol, and weed.

well, first two things I do a lot...
insane lugia. ive used swiftkit before which im on. im more familiar with it.
12Oh, so you're insane lugia?
for some odd reasonit wont let me change name /nick insane_Lugia
yeahuh :)
12SKUser784
6I prescreened this week's movies, as well as watched all the pony eps with my friends.
12whoops
/nick InsaneLugia
haven't had weed since... 12 years ago maybe?
12Well, in that case, welcome to TST's chat :)
hm
6And between the four of us we went through four bottles of vodka and a half of weed.
12InsaneLugia
XD
other chat lines let me put the under scroll
12you can't nickchange to Insane_Lugia because there already is an Insane_Lugia
oh sec
12which i'd suggest getting rid of yeah XD
6OH GOD THIS CANNOT END WELL
12|D
12now you can do it
but drunken pony party sounds like a great idea
there we go :)
6It was pretty awesome.
6And ballsy at the same time.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nhssMi2FtA
6I remember coating a spider in glue and lighting it on fire so it was crystalized...
oh look it's RD VA
Haha, oh wow
12Oh, okay thanks :3
Sprinkes you are far kinder to spiders then I am
then again the ones we get out here are no joke
I pick spiders up and release them outside.
6We just flat out lit most of them on fire with a can of spray paint.
Seriously, I hate flies and bees and shit, spiders eat those guys for breakfast.
i suggest you send th e owner a message asking for the name of it XD
had a brown recluse on my deck recently, droped an anvel on it.

lolol
/me slaps Umbreon around a bit with a large trout
lol i was known fo rslapping ppl inswiftkit.
6We've only played it once.
6For the promotion of Sathi and RBD from hop to op.
i downloaded ghos tmouse which recordes mouse scroll and repetes it over and over in a endless loop. i got booted and banned from selveral chats XD
was mainly rival clan chats lol
6Since prior to them the only one that was promoted was myself.
So you are currently breaking the law?
6Nope.
she wants to know the name of the song
6It was never decided this was the official video.
6I basically just named it as it.
6And there are TWO people watching, so it's not a huge deal.
12even has a download link
That works. :P
6It's not like when dari played Spider's Web.
-gets on runescape-
6With a good amount of people.
6We're supposed to wait 6 months before allowing a movie to be picked and shown again
but basically showing people a Stephen Baldwin movie amounts to torture
So how long have you guys been around any ways?
12I'll be sure to do that fro now on
6This week was week 14.
12for*
cool
6I've been here since week... 4.
12XD
6Though I've been in the chat since week 1.
I've been here... like 4 weeks. :P
this is my third week swinging through.
6Hipster and DCD are the original mods.
12i was hoping for a challenge D:
6Ghosties, Silver, and Peanut were from week 2.
12XD
6Dari and myself are week 4.
would have been 4 but by the time I saw it on EqD the stream was over.
6And RBD and Sathi are week... 9?
6 9 or 10.
Oh, wow, so they haven't been here that much longer than me, I guess
this song alwasy reminds me of Cat's eye
6They've been in the stream the whole time.
6But that's not a big deal as long as you know what you're doing.
6We're actually looking for mods atm.
eeeeeeeeeh
night fellas
6Night Bjorn.
Yeah I just sent a mail to you guys a bit ago about the mod thing
Morning, bjornfot :P
Song takes on a much creepier tone with this video....
wow is the fram rate taht bad on this video or is my stream bombing out again?
It's choppy here too
12You know what's odd? I never asked Insane_Lugia anything like that |D
this song so fits pinky
i have no idea what "numa" means
thenagain probaly could say the same thing for any song with 120bpm
she's constantly on a sugar rush from herself
6Sumica, check your email, it says we sent you an application to fill out.
12Must have confused me with someone else
12o-O

12Welcome back
little lost with swiftkit
ty and chat is gone how do i do it again on swift?
6wikiwalking is fun
12it wipes the memory clean of whoever it revealed its eyes to
12that must be why brock never opens his eyes, he has the same powers
Seems numa numa is don't want don't want
12LOL
not sure on that though
6It is.
12Insane_Lugia
12let's see if you can remember it, go over the steps with me to your best knowledge and i'll correct you where possible
12wipe away ash’s memory? That would be scary
12Considering he can’t remember anything anyways XD
-pokes umbreon-
do not want...
12yes?
ima screen it :)
That's a pretty useful song, then.
12no need to do that

12new server window, type /server ocean.lugia.us

12Ah

making breakfast now...
swiftkit will make it happen tho :)
12not much runescape players here though
12if any
12Yeah, I wish I had more time lol
thats the good part. you dont have assholes.
wonder if any one has tryed to figure best pony based on stars of PMV's.
so what were the lottery winner picks?
6Next week's movies?
um bucaroobanzi and goonies
12try to watch language Insane_Lugia
did't catch the eps
6Yeah... it's gonna be... crazy.
6Eps are Cutie Mark Chronicles and Boast Busters.

Bucaroo has some realy bad syncing

im going on 23 in september.
04Is english the first language you were taught?
04Sorry, I really don't know much about you.
i do so wish to share my dreadful past on a insight of what ice evolved from but i fear the most of a bad outlook on past behaveour =\
only language iknow. i never was a good speller :p
04Ah
goin through 2nd grade i had A.D.D. and i was not able to focuse on school work so it held me back in reading and learning how to spell words.
seeing as we had russan pony for a moment have some random crap
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWTFG3J1CP8
still got add but its not bad enough for meds.
most of my actions are impulse. aka not thought out just act and its made it hard to make friends.
Russia and ponies, two of everyone's favorite things
12I see. We all have our issues lol
6Hollywood Undead <3
on the bright side, i have been told i do present my self really well.
12Some are just more noticeable than others
04:/
i just want friends, people that dont mind having me around or looking the other way. it hurts when you dont feel wanted.
i has not heard them
04Oh well
04No one's perfect right?
or i guess now i have?
ive said th at before drake :)
6Some of there stuff is depressing, but some of it is REALLY good.
04I like repeating people
04It makes me sound smart
/me runs
XD
12XD
I like happy. Happy is good.
6Not all of it is depressing.
6Just like two or three songs.
6And they do it in a joking way.
well, that's fine then
hard to get any thing too depressing with technocollored ponies.
6: D PORTAL
And that makes scoos too cute to handle
6That was adorable.
<3 JoCo
with do all honesty tho, i have exhausted my limits with people in runescape to where i dont want to play nomore. u do stuff fo rthem and they wont do stuff for you. they just use and abuse you. if you are not that jerk of the group that flames people. then you are not a part of the "select group" of people that they call "friend" the same goes for if you dont hate the people the hate. its just brutal.
good song
wonder if people have made PMVs of his other songs
its what i like to refer to as a fake friend. i just wana be my self =\
love the cover this guy did
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgabSyAePyM
12Yeah, most real friends usually try to let you be yourself
lol, look, pardoning the fact that this is the internet and no one cares about personal problems, I'll just say that being yourself is the most important thing
found one
Then he'd be fabulooooous
and Bacteria is Magic PMV
i wonder where flutterfly is
that second one seems to suck though
she left tst and didnt say anything. then again she did say she viewed it for 1 week before makign an appearances
lol unfortunately most PMVs kinda do.

but they have ponies in them, so all is forgiven
yeah but even the song seems to bomb
speeking of which, i have yet to add 100 songs to my playlist yet lol
or it could be I have had my head set on too long

That's a great song right thar
will be glad when S2 comes out just so people have more stock to work with for PMV's
6That's a good song.
ahhh sorry!
6I hear ya, Sumica.
12np
i thought it was going to go in a stream accrose the chat border
12Ah
like the chat i just sent
I love it but after a bit you see the same shots over and over and over.
Good Pick RP
anyhow i was going to share a list of artices i would like to go through to add to my play list lol
why is your text blue night? :o
Yeah, and often the same shots are very popular to many people.
12It’s just my preference :3
how :p
like flaming Twilight, sonic rainboom and so on.
yarr
lol as you say it
12Before everything I say, I use Ctrl + k, then it lets my choose a color
a rainboom
fancy ^_^
and that shot of cheering fluttershy
12Yep
lol
some are still a bit more creative. well in a way such as the cowboy bebop one.
i dont think itlikes me
Yeah
12swiftkit's irc client
12Are you using mibbit?
12isn't exactly equipped to be a full running client
Well I don't think a video is automatically bad because it uses a popular shot
oh no defenatly not
meaning?
12swift kit is designed to make your average runescape player happy, nothing more nothing less
lol I'm definitely going to have to use some popular shots in my PMV... if it ever gets done.
12Ah
12i'm simply saying that there is many better programs out there
lol ican get like 7 chats going
maybe 9
More just commenting it looses a bit when to me when I have see it so much
Maybe I'll just do a giant animated GIF dump of all the stuff I've isolated from the background
I can send files!
like that last one had alot of the standared pinkie shots but was still good as they put more in to it then just that.
12I just use pastebin for that XD
12i can........ do this "..............."
12And e-mail
there you go, an all Background pony pmv =p
12Anyways
12Good night everyone
good night ;(
well no, not like that, I just cut things out so I can use the animations on a different background :P
bleh it's the Scrach ep of bebop
I knew what you ment was just running off on a tangent. I do that.
that cake was a lie, it was a pie
lol well a background pony PMV would be nice... there's just very little material.
whats that pony nme dagain that does nothign but talk?
lol ithink i am best related to her XD
So in this PMV Twi kills everyone
6OH GAWD OLD PONIES
yeah would probably have to use all of thes eps just to get it done
...interesting
inb4 sea ponies
can you lend me a flame thrower?
oh god that ancient Spike
old spikes voice *shudders*
it's a worgen!

might have to look that one up
Wish i had the tools and um knowhow for video editing, I has ideas but no outlet.
3.5 was the giant eye ones right?
like g4 but up to 11
no idea about what free video editing tools are available outside of linux
well, kinda like G4 to 11
yeah, not too woried about it. I could get them from the usual sorces but still would have to learn them.
also horribly deformed heads
I feel like i should get out a lighter for this one.
just editing video isn't too hard, it just takes a lot of time to get the right clips
6...I was looking for mine, though that's because I want a smoke.
heh
it's once you get into layers and filtering that it gets really hard
...and really processor intensive, obnoxiously so
how did iget connection lost?
also my rig is't set up well for editing. need more memory
it never showed any connection problems
where did everybody go?
cant even open those 16000dpi vectors =p
you pinged

lol not sure I want to try opening those
cant udo some weird stuff with my ip address?
makes you wonder how the hell they even made such a thing.
This is all your fault Curly.
6THANK YOU EQD SCRIPT
oh they did it piece by piece, it was a cooperative thing on ponychan
oh hey can you post that pony polka one from earlyer, I could never find it.
you and your canadian guile.
PC did one too?
yea, please do tell me what ping out means
and odes articuno use relay?
I ment the one from DA that had people rageing from the OC's in the ballon.
someone made one on their own? :O
was like 5 people they did one at 16k and 30K
i thought that was started at ponychan, but maybe i'm wrong
*digs for link*
?
mind telling me what pinged outmeans
after the rage they went back and redid it without the OC's
Basically, on IRC, the IRC server sends your client a message, which is called a "ping"
oh, that's good
The client responds with a "pong" to tell the IRC server that it's still alive
spiked the punch
ping means you poke someone they poke you back
lack of activity = ping out?
04so
If the IRC server doesn't receive that pong within a specific amount of time - it's 120 seconds on this network - it kills the user
04yeah
if you poke someone and they don't poke you back
Insane_Lugia, sort of
you've lost your conection
lol
04I need to do homework but I really don't want to.
04Baaaaaw

Noticed a bit of a trend to the music a bit yes
but I'm probably misreading something
/me is not slapped around with a large trout.

6You're totally misreading RP.
6Spike likes Apple Bloom.

04Yeah
04But oh well
http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6519.msg274277#new

oh, okay
6>mfw this hasn't been played yet today

6I'm not playing an ep due to having to leave at any moment.
haha
epilog version of we are men?
I should go soon, too.
6Hercules song.
ah never saw it.
Wait a RD vid, You are slipping Sprinkles.
6?
Rarity is't staring in this one.
6XD
6I got lazy of looking for Rarity vids.
lol
That one
Some people are already starting to use its advice seriously
Kamien or how ever you spell it rider is monday right?
Someone made a password generator off that
6Possibly.
6I can never keep up with what DCD is planning, tbh.
Ah oki
._.
And really, it's quite true
He realy should start posting what he's planing =p
I have a !genpass script
6Honestly we rarely even run things by eachother anymore. We generally agree on most ideas. =/
ah the head bob thing I could never master.
04holy crap
04I only just realised May joined HoR
04Shock and horror
Passwords like I*b7*(k97
Are short and machine-guessable
6And there'll probably be some form of tentative schedule for the streams throughout the week at some point...
Drake you're slow
And impossible for us to remember
heh
I realy liked the giant robot thing he did tonight
I use passwords like j0asJ3kJs9d012
04I haven't been on HoR for like, 3 weeks
And I find them easy to remember after a while
And yet there are still some BOFHs who think that kind of password is the best
eh
they're okay
I know of several sites that put limits on the maximum number of characters in your password
it's faster to crack hashes
and lol hotmail
And then expect you to use passwords like that
yeah
6I honestly didn't even know about that, though I wasn't here most of the week, so it's whatevs.
lol
My password is 15 characters long precisely because of this
Wish I could've been here for the giant robots...
04Seriously
04I'm gonna use that image everywhere now
6Like I said, we generally only really clear absolutely major things with eachother.
Though my Windows password is like 50+ characters
and not just half an episode of Megas :P
using similar rules
it's ok I have megas on my external so If I realy wanted to watch the rest i could.
was a ton of them already before that
6>mfw PMV of this
what can i do to help lugia.us?
i want to partake in helping the site :)
6zzz
oh original work?
lol that sums up my feeling
6Yeah.
26 letters and 2 numbers
and no it's not the alphabet
6I am SO tired.
that is nice to see.
lol heh
I should make some coffee and start doing some crap here.
6Luckily I don't have work until 5 PM. XD
est?
6EST
yikes
6This is nothing. I've stayed up for 106 hours.
it's past late and geting early
6I HOLD THE PONYCHAN RECORD
crackhead
6THE PONIES ARE IN MY BRAIN. XD
lol it's not healthy to stay up that long, though i've been there... or maybe not 106 hours
must I ever pulled was 90hr and i think I was out of it the last 10 or so
6The 106 was just to make a point when somepony else was staying up ridiculously long aswell.
6I don't think either of us do now...
!genpass
my brain stoped loging things i was holding conversations on autopilot with out saving any thing to short term memory
6We had a thing where we were going to see who could stay up the longest, with 100 hours being the min.
but that was back when Starcraft was new =p
6But they never responded to me... though I did it anyway.
had a 9 hr match
6This. Is. Boring.
haha
yeah not the best one.
well guys, i'm gonna head off so I get some things done here at home
6See ya.
ping
nope

Reminiscence chapter 24 is depressing
04"While both believe that non believers will spend an eternity in hell, Catholicism believes that believers go to 'Purgatory' to make up for their sins, whereas Protestants believe that through 'Sola Fida' (Faith alone) believers go straight to Heaven due to the sacrifice of Jesus on the Cross."

my computer has been on for nearly 828 hours
fun fact
hello everybrony
Usually download sites say "blah blah blah premium" and I'm like whatever, cause you couldn't limit my download enough to where I'd notice it.
But holy shit, this one is seriously down to 15kb/s and I swear I'd sell my soul just to get this my normal slow speed.
Wait no, I'm keeping my soul for the box of infinite pocky.
I could stop world hunger using my brown sticks.
why don't businesses do these kinds of publicity stunts anymore :(
I guess after they accidentally created the energizer battery they had to stop
energizer bunny...
Been better done to other employees.
lol
hi

Server's acting up it seems
hey Sathi
how are ya today^
heya
I was a bit busy today cleaning up the house.
How are you today?
I'm fine, gotta have to print my classes schedule today or tomorrow.
other then that enjoying the weekend?
I failed at my streamtest last night... somehow capturing audio is not possible :(
such a expensive machine...
I think I was there
yeah, I agree that ain't fun.
hey Dman
Hi
btw, the robot stream ended at around 4:30 AM my time.
So I guess it would've ended at 9:30 for you.
...wow, I woke up at 9:00
yeah. Well I went to sleep at around 1:30.

Watched the movie (found it booooooring. THe title do you remember love said it ALL.)
good i'm not there
It'd be carnage there then
also
Then, two episodes of Gundam X and Eureka 7 (I prefered EurekA 7 of the lot) and 1 episode of Gravion. Then, went to rest.
6 year old news :P
any of them stand out?
like I said, I prefered Eureka 7.
The art style probably helped.

we had a very serious accident last night at the state fair
:S what happened
the stage collapsed due to strong winds from a severe thunderstorm
right before a Sugarland concert
five people were killed and 40 injured
What is it?
I-it's nothing!
D:
(even if only a little, a pony pic shouldn't turn me on AT ALL to begin with D: what is happening to meeee?)
I actually saw the breaking news story as it happened
WRTV and WTHR interrupted programing to cover this
wow...
that's terrible news
Dermathil - tell me a good gurren lagann ep i can watch that isn't the final one :P
actually ALL the Indianapolis TV stations did
the fair is closed today due to a police investigation of the incident
tell me a good ep from when team gurren leave to find the antispiral pweees
and will reopen tomorrow after a memorial service
i'll watch it
the whole area was under a severe thunderstorm warning last night
we had some strong gusts of wind up to about 60 MPH
and lightning everywhere
My internet derped.

And Dari won't be around until Monday
oh
That's just his bot
I see
mew
oh
:3
/me feeds the Cat milk
cool, cool
why does everyone use mibbit
Cat: Have you heard the song Bohemian Rhapsody?
there are people who have never heard Bohemian Rhapsody? o.O
of course I have
lol
it's like, a superclassic song
and awesome
I heard it a while ago, and I had no idea what it was called
yeah, its pretty awesome
:OO
PEOPLE!
ohai
Cat: You should come visit me in canada!
:D Ho
Hi *
I already have a visit to the Netherlands next summer planned
Cool, cool
I can't go everywhere D: not enough monies
oh D:
but maybe I will visit Canada one day
:D
and maybe I will visit theUK
where do you live, london?
ohai
Cat: ^^^^^^
so what's going on in here?
apart from the secret shipping
Hi, Robotpinkie
I do not live near London
or... other non UKers
/me suddenly has an idea for a fanfic concept
term-time I live in Wolverhampton, which is near Birmingham, the second city
"PONY ENGLISH!!!"
ponified version of this movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274166/
03o.o
Make it happen!
has someone already made a Pony Bravo?
Took keep it faithful to the style of the movie, it would need to be at least K+
that's just screaming for Blueblood
Too*
To*
btw, Johnny English would SO be a B-movie.
right?
I dunno, high production values, went up in major theatres...
funny as hell?
5.5/10 on IMDb?
Well, I guess it might count as B movie in the lottery
*5.8
lol 5.8 isn't all that bad, I've enjoyed far worse movies!
but yeah, I guess it's B movie slot
oh, and there's a sequel coming in october 2011
really? that's kind of unexpected
but its going to be fun.
Rowan Atkinson is always fun to watch.
Isn't he working on the Tintin movie with lots of CGI too?
I believe so, and the release date is slated for sometime in 2013
but plans had started as early as 2002, I believe
ah
They're promising that JP 4 will be beyond anything we've seen in the franchise before. They're promising big, so I hope they deliver
I doubt it, but one can hope.
Ohai
ohai
hey
btw
seems like Suited for Success was originally supposed to be called "Dressed for Failure" (or something like that)
Yea sorry dermathil stuff came up, i'm here now
also Lolwut
yeah
Evolution of a scene #4 came out
YES!
wtf i go for a run, and there's like 5 new EQD posts, yet i sit around doing sod all for hours and like 1 or 2 posts. lol

no idea
wait, 2 silvermanes?
wait
nvm
lol yup
and, according to dermathil, 9:30 my time
so GMT 8:30
so it lasted 6 hours
Well, It might have lasted 6 or 7 hours.
depends on how long the movie was.
ah
yeah, I think it was 7 hours.
okies
2 hour movie + 10 30minute episodes = 2+5 =7
13I swear it wasn't that long since I last ate o-o

Then that will be hard
07arf, etc.
I mean, barry, unless you know of some really godo fics you want me to read :P
I think they're good, but you might not. What do you like besides FiM?

Want a really good read? Read "Its a dangerous business, going out your door."
oh good... one sec
I will read cupcakes too! (at last)
oh dear. make sure you read all alt-endings as well
I think a Father's Love, which is a Naruto fiction, is a good read
that's an [EPIC] fic.
Shades of Pink is Pinkie Pie with Dark, but not Cupcakes
Dermathil - saved :P
oh wow many coming in
Barry I like naruto
Pony Psychology Series is good
Silvermane - alt endings?
Read freezeframe , twas so good
Have you read all the way through to Ditzy Doo: Muffins?
There's a New Chance at Life, a Pokemon fiction
>mfw I remember I'll have Badminton as my sport in college
Skittles, The Sacrifice and the Return of Spring, Kindness's Reward, Black and White, Lyrical Musings, Out in the Cold (and all sequels), Progress: Luna Vs
Freezeframe - i have already saved luna and muffins, but not read those yet
AAA so manyyyy (thank you bronies)
Dman, the alt endings to cupcakes
...don't even have cupcakes let alone alt endings
hmm
I can't just google them i think, there may be loads. is there like a link with all of them?

Past Sins is up to chapter 18
/me is instead watching Princess Brides

/me places some mashed potatoes on each of her tails :O
Past sins?
Another PKMN fic is AAML: Diamond and Pearl Edition (Ash and Misty Love: Diamond and Pearl Edition), which is basically the Diamond and Pearl series with Misty along for the ride
04wait why am I still using this name
Miracle Max is awesome.
ok then
Past Sins is apparently a marmite fic. You either love it, or hate it.
Marmite?
marmite?
/me 7blinks.
ah that thing ok
Never had marmite, but I've decided to love it.
welp just saved past sins so :P
04I have mashed potatoes irl
7Ah.
Ah, the fun with differences between mostly dead and all dead.
04with too much salt and butter
04they are delicious
/me 7noms said potatoes.
07o.o
(Dermathil - LOTR 1 now with dad =D_
i guess I should read it then :P
Heh, Miracle Max's wife.
I've heard good things about It's a Dangerous Business, Going Outside, but I haven't read it yet (it's next on my list)
And Witch of the Westmareland needs to be read just for being a Medieval folk ballad crossover
lol
next on my list is actually past sins :P but now i'm just gonna grab em all and more recommended here. Thanks bronies ^_^

And yet, it works for him.

Mornin' Dari.
6and most of those hours were sleeping :D
13LOL Dedication :D
DARI
HOW ARE YOU!!!
/me goes to watch Blazing Saddles next
6IT IS GORGEOUS
6and as beautiful as it is

6my favorite part is the flower viewing
6cuz EVERYONE
6IS THERE
13YES
13<3
6IN STUNNING ANIMATED GLORY
I'm good thanks, how about you?
I'm feeling in great shape, I got my classes schedule for the next 15 weeks
13Also, I was waiting for you to get here so I could ask you a quick question about the game itself |D
6ASK AWAY I HAVE ANSWERS ALWAYS
/me 6walking touhou encyclopedia
13Does your copy of the game include text in the dialogue boxes? Because mine doesn't for some reason o_o
no classes on fridays, but Monday's starting with Philosophy at 8:00AM
6...
6that's weird
6cuz i gave you the same copy i downloaded
6and mine does lOL
So, I heard tell of something showing on the site today?
13Nah, I downloaded another copy from utorrent that someone else gave me because I thought some silly error would come up if I tried to download the one you gave me again |D
Johnny English is probably either A or B.
13Not that it matters too much considering I won't be able to read it anyway LOL
13but still o-o
6um
6why would you get an error?
6what kind of error o.o
Classes start in two weeks for me.
lucky bastard. :P
13I have no idea, but when the download was about 70% complete it suddenly cancelled itself and some kind of "unexpected error" came up
13I raged
13D:
ah thanks Dari. I was wondering seeing how hilarious that movie is.
6hmm
6let me try something for you
13I'd waited about 3 hours for it too LOL
Original Seven Samurai. . .A or B? I'd think A.
Definitely A, I'd say.
but I don't make the rules
Yeah, looks like A.
Bai
And Hai DRF
Ah, the best scene in Generations. Data's "lifeform scanning" song
6I think just try again maybe
6if that doesnt work
6then iunno
my stats for runescape ^_^ i wana hug sombody ina lugia costume and get a photo for my comp
http://img847.imageshack.us/img847/4205/020105100636.png
Huh. Kagemusha.
03You must actually be insane if you like RunEscape.
It's in his name
03^
so, are you going to stream stuff today Dari?
Sure.
Or you going to take the day off since I heard you were on vacations for the weekend?)
Nah, I was climbing a mountain.
ooh, nice.
I couldn't climb the other mountain, forgot I had something to do on Monday.
So we came back today.
ah
BTW
13'Kay I'll let that download in the background, and apparently it's not gonna take 2/3 hours to download this time
NewDCD said he couldn't make it for the stream monday
something came up
13I was probably just given a dodgy/incomplete copy or something |D
Monday stream?
told us at the beginning of the robot show
/me 7meeps.
Yeah the monday stream
a Kamen Rider marathon
Oh yeah.
03LOL suggestive comments on GSN
03Yes, I'm so bored that I'm watching Game Show Network.
03as my desktop is out of commision for about 3 days :/
argh, wish I could be here for that
13I can agree that the game is definitely easier than previous games though, since I got to the final boss on my second run in normal mode
What happened to your desktop DRF? O.o
03the CPU cooler is broken.
03now, if it just didn't work I wouldn't mind
03but
well DCD can't make it
Ahhhh
03it has a safety feature built in that if it detects a problem it BEEPS VERY LOUDLY
03s7o I can't use my desktop without pissing off the entire house
Hi Dari
Hey Barry.
03as it sounds like a semitruck backing up, quite literally, and it's just as loud
03and it does that constantly >_>
How about a Beast Wars marathon?
03so I went to get a replacement cooler, and the one they sent me was ALSO BROKEN :@
better than Kamen Rider marathon? Not to me, anyway. :P
One of these days I need to pick up season one of that show.
motherboard?
though it depends on the KR, if it's Den-O... uh... a lot of things are probably better.
03no
03CPU cooler.
03it's actually a really nice unit when it works
03called the ChillTEC, by Ultra Products
6it's definitely easier, angel, but I'm having trouble with the fact that most of the bullet patterns are random instead of an actual pattern
But it apparently didn't last
actually, a Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann marathon would be insanely fun.
Never watched any of the Kamen Rider shows myself.
6that and yoshika reviving herself by EATING THOSE SOULS
6is annoying D:
13I haaaate that LOL
13Then when she laughs at me for failing to capture the spellcard
13.-.
But I know it is already saved for the Robot Saturday Night Stream as a future anime
/me group hugs-
6see
6after beating the trial forever ago
6I stopped playing
6so I could do toher things and play other touhou ames
6games
6so now I fail at this game miserably
6cuz I forgot EVERYTHING lol
I wub Kamen Rider.
Hello guys
Is it as awesome as Captain Marvelous?
Maybe not as much as Ultra series, need to watch more of the new ones.
13Well I've only just started playing it today and I've already had my fair share of failures
04jebus
hai Ziltoid
04was that really necessary
13such as running into the boss's head/body/whatever multiple times
6but you made it to the last stage already
13and running into fairies that aren't even moving
13|D
6granted
6I've played it all of 5 times
6and yeah
I found the best gif of all time
6I've done that
and I did enjoy what I saw of TTGL
http://i.imgur.com/rrVTa.gif
6my worst failure is watching a bullet
6I did a circle around the bullet
6and then ran right into the bullet
lawl wut
but I'm like... 5 episodes in, and apparently it gets much better in the end
DERP
6all the while thinking "I swear to god if I hit that bullet"
13LOL
Heh. "Authentic frontier gibberish."
6so I hit it
Ah, you haven't reached the point wherein Kamina leaves the show.
lolno
13In this game I've made it a habit to regularly circle to boss after spellcards to pick up points/souls and such, hence why I've run into them by accident so often .w.
6same
what is Derpy holding?
Ashes.
6...
6OH MY GOD LOL
oh
6I just figured out how to use the trance state
6I could never understand how people used it without getting hit
6I'm a failure at life
Stream's up.
So, what's on?
13LOL I looked it up on the wiki soon after the demo came out :P
Nothing yet.
Ah
6I never really thought about it being used whenever
I might put on some Torchwood or Doctor Who.
13Still, I'm terrible at knowing the best times to use it
6until I saw it on the live stream
6just now I actually thought HMM I BET THAT WOULD BE USEFUL
6looked it up
Doctor Who would be awesome.
6and voila
13Also, pink and green souls for more lives/bombs
13taunt me so much
13They make me want to take risks and go get them even when the screen is full of bullets
...as would Torchwood, really
13then I die for being reckless about it .-.
LIVE READING OF SILVERMARE x MIRTHTINKER
DO IT
6I'm pretty good about collecting the green and pink souls since they're rare and I know where they are now
oh, forgot to turn on sound, lol
6but I have this thing
did I miss some clopfics?
6where I REALLY want to collect ALL THE THINGS
6and that's wat kills me
6and i still seem to be scared to use my bombs lol
6even though it's gone back to bomb counter, not power base
Jack Harkness x Celestia
wat
DAAAAAAAW
now that's Nyx.
but was she wearing socks?
glasses
13Well it DOES make you feel helpless and panicky when you're about to die
Dramatic reading of Spiderses?
13and you press X and nothing happens
13|D
13then again, I've captured spellcards like that in the past somehow o-o
lol I'd get behind the Spiderses thing
6but now it's like we have two kinds of bombs
6trance state, i need to get used to that now that I know it's not a death only attack
what site is that?
no thanks, self-reading Spiderses was too amazing as it is. i'd die if someone read it to me
6who's your favorite of the TD cast so far?
oh okay, colors confused me.
6I'll be honest, I'm not as attached to these characters as the other games (minus UFO as I don't care for the characters in there much lol)
The Spiderses was THAT amazing
it gave several readers super powers!
17 of them cryogenically froze themselves because it was so amazing
oh Twilight is Sad movie? such a sad thing
the ending was bawww
Twilight's lonely plot
Turn it up
can't hear sounds, yeah
Sad Movie = Grave of the Fireflies
13Yeah I don't really feel much for these characters at the moment
13But Toyosa
13is <3
6toyosaaaaaa
poor spike
13Also, stage 4 boss makes me think she's too scared/weak to fight by herself
13Can't remember he name yet |D
13*her
6seiga <3
I love sad endings in movies.
6I actually do like her
13And I keep yelling at Yoshika to get out the way D:
Grave of the Fireflies starts off sad, and never really stops being sad.
6while i wish she'd fight on her own
Q_Q
6it's beautiful danmaku when she revives yoshika
Especially if you realize what's actually happening in the intro
6I was like OOOOOH SO PRETTY *dead*
I'll have to watch it...
I've seen almost every other Ghibli movie
When the cop takes a taste of the crumbs in the dead kid's food tin.
Don't spoil it for people who haven't seen the movie yet.
what movie?
Grave of the Fireflies.
never seen it
not planning on it, I don't like spoilers
13The danmaku when she revives Yoshika scares me so much |D Up until now I've always had to bomb when she does it on certain spellcards
13The return of curvy lasers scares me too D:
6I use the revival as my advantage
6since seiga takes a huge moment of doing nothing
someone should make a pony TC for some game.
13True, but still makes me go ASDFGHJ when the revival actually happens xD
and by someone, I mean anyone but me, basically.
13Also, I find myself using Sanae the most in this game for some reason
there are tons of Magic the Gathering pony cards
6I havent used her
6marisa and youmu are my mains
6youmu primarily
6because FOCUSSLASH WOOOOOOT
for the PC game, or?
13I can't get used to Youmu's focused attack at all LOL

(and then I was shipped by prin--)
Another ship? omg

RBD
yer waifu
wait, are you doing Skype?

dari's waifu?
dammit. i'm not home, so i can't
no, Silvermane's waifu
I'm confused.
Oh that makes sense.

Mountain climbing or?
Mondo vs Sheriff
he's afraid of heights
I guess
Or is it Mongo.
I have no problem with mountains
This is riveting
HEY DARI HOW ABOUT YOU START THE EPISODE
Well you can try all you like, but you still won't beat Brian Blessed.
/me is currently in skype.
He fucking beat Everest, and I mean to a pulp
You were only getting one half othe convo. :P
I know, but I can pretend I know what you were talking about all I like!

7Ping can happen on any client. o3o

It seems like the server stops sending PINGs and it's up to the clients to send them now
/me turns on socketspy
7Well, they just stay on the IRC--as long as the connection is stable, people cand o that.
7can do*

Hmm.
03"Name something you might hurt your back trying to move" "Couch"
lol
03I move our couches all the time
03I would have said a desk or something
moisturizer
Are you using the dinkypage link or .co.cc?
Try both.
ha ha
Maybe when you're trying to move between locations
Coach in the staircase
like on TV
03LOL
03let's see what the second person says
03(This is the Fast Money segment)
what's the co.cc link?
bronystate.co.cc
bronystate.co.cc
Almost
03...
03the second guy said couch
03and then changed to TV
Inconceivable!
...weird
03well this is the old version from before they had flat panels. but still LOL
03WHY NOBODY SAY DESK
Lol.
That would have sucked.
yeah
Desks are boring :p
It stops on "waiting for veemi.com"
03WTF?
Or the desks were hollow
03Couch was the #1 answer
03WHAT THE FRICK PEOPLE
EXTERMINATE!
LOLWUT
I guess routing problem. :(
03How hard is it to move a couch
try a 32in CRT TV
I'm fine
That's WAY heavier than a couch
I can see the stream. It must be on your end, Pinkie
03I know right
03also wtf
ahem
how about 40" tv
03the number one answer for thing kids want before bedtime was milk
@check veemi.com
dat gun
@check veemi.com
6veemi.com is up.
Not on my end, must be some error routing traffic from veemi to me. Youtube works fine, can stream 720p without issue.
03ew milk
LOL
/me watches the Newlywed Game now
I know no kids who wants milk before bed
03I love this show
03^
03and apaprently it was the #1 answer
hello everypony
Hi Crono
only veemi.com... weird as shit
so which episode are we watching?
Episode 12
YOU DUN' GOOF'D DOCTOR
season 1?
Eeyup
ah
Old season one or New season one?
oh, connected now.... just barely, lolz
New.
it's in color
^ Lol
the old season one is monocrome, I believe
And the Doctor is an old guy I believe.
Yeah.
Myeah, it's monochrome and very low tech
In one he travels with his granddaughter or something.
is stream up?
SilverMane just gender swapped.
Yeah. It's pretty good, actually.
Lawl
Yeah.
It's up.
The Tom Baker era is fun.
i can't get the low quality stream to run
now stream seems to be back to working fairly well for me
I'm not streaming LQ
oh. great
welp, i'm bored out of my mind now
I don't know what system DCD uses.
He uses some external service now.
try stream again, whatever problem I was having seems to be going away.
o___O
Bai bai Rose
co.cc page has weird formatting though :(
oh my god its philomena
Rose is just trolling
"What's your crime?" "Stampeding cattle." "That's not much of a crime. . ." "Through the Vatican?" "Kinky. Sign here."
terrible guards are terrible
XD
03...LOL that's what she said
03"You put that on, you keep that on"
03they meant it about wedding rings, but LOL

6and RSE
6but that was yesterday
Bill Nye?
03I wonder if they have a small print term saying you can't make massive trips to the bathroom and stay there for several days
/me runs
03since Denny's is open 24/7 now apparently
Bill Bill the science guy
03just imagine some homeless person going there
No, Bill Nighy, there's a difference
lol not the same person, no
03and being like "you never said wh8en the promo ends"
I'm now greatly amused by the idea of the Science Guy as the Doctor.
Not the Science Guy, the british actor
6hmm
6reminds me
Bill Neigh, Science Colt

Yup, watching it on USA right now
>cup of tea
7If you get everyone else's messages, then you should've gotten mine. O.o
Brit.
7Anyway, it's just an indicator to properly capitalize words. :P
lol please try to understand im on runescape + tst chat box. it is really difficult to pay attention to both. im focusing on like 4 diff thigns atm XD. but im still trying lol
02well, don't lol
and sence ur orange text stands out hard not to see itlol
7I don't multitask to such a degree you do. :P
7And really, is it that difficult to press shift while you type?
Nope, never seen this episode.
not a crutch or excuse but ive got ADD lol if i dont do multi task ill get all talktive then no 1 will want me around due to being random and bored and talking too much. soo i have to inoder to preserve relations :)
runescape and swiftkit are 2 differnt chat boxes.
7o3o
u cant do both at the same time if u chat in swift ur not playing the game., u play the game u have to click on swift to reply then the came
I just realized that Tosh has a pony tail... suddenly show turned even cooler.
02LOL, that is half of the people on the IRC. talktive people idling and talking about random-ness .-.
Pony tails are cool
12one is always best to use instead of 1. Just saying :3
02</late>
lol sorry if i seeme out of it i feel like a mindless zombie when playing runescape. not good.
12Ah
7That's what MMORPGs want you to feel like. :P
7It's an addictive property, I suppose you can relate it to.
lol i feel numb. no thought just click click click
and replys are on a impulse scale
less thought out
06Is it bad if I think it's rather lazy that there's scripts out there to capitalize the first letter for people? :P
02LOL
02I want one
02xD
runescape does that
ig you put a period it caps the next letter after the period
and I need to go to bed, long trek to class tomorrow :(
02anywayssss...

/me ragequits
lolz!
I know the feeling
/me doesnt know what his favorite games are tbh
02Anyone up for some TF2?
;w;
12Pokemon Soul Silver is the best Pokemon game I've ever played
so much skipping and lagging
06And that shows that people enjoy a variety of game so my question is
06How can so many people only play CoD and be content with it? .-.
stream is fine for me
/me has SS belong to her forever and ever torture >:3
I know
Lag isn't anything on my end.
Ohai everypony.
06inb4codIsAFish
not only that they are obsessed with the Zombies mode >>
brb,gotta eat
02Some questions are better to leave un-answered .-.
Lawl
hi
oh bye
wut
13Interesting fact about my favourite games: Other than Touhou, all my favourites have made me cry at least once :P
02LOL, Zombie mode is fun. tho, it gets boring for me after a while
AND THEN THEY FUCKED
/me owns Novi instead >:3
06Well I understand people obsessed with Zombies more than those playing the multiplayer 24/7
06xD
COCK BLOCK
02Nah Touhou made you cry
ohai, CHICKEN TIME
7(TF2, that is.)
>> uhh nope
13Cry with anger? LOL
02because you know
JACK Y U
Zombies are boring ._.
02Beating an extra boss
>> yup
12Hmm, sure. Will Espeon play as well?
02Tears of happiness?
06The fun you get with zombies are directly proportional to the amount of friends you play with.
06And nah, gotta be lazyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
06aka sleep
TIMEY WOBBLEY WIMEY STUFF
12XD
13D:

13You're not going anywhere
/me holds Espeon back

13!espeon
heheheh
02LOL

I'm back
anyone got $9 to spare?
):
the ball made me think of it
/me ties Espeon tails together in an intricate manner.
02lmfao
No!
SS, tbh, isn't my favorite Pokemon game
06accidentally*
:3
oh hi again
I dont have a fav pokemon game :P
oh wait
XD
I misread that
02Soo..
Emerald is pretty awesome, but atm mine is Black
all the pokemon games are great
12Black was awesome
7I'm RPing and taking a YouTubeaWalk. D:
7-a
but honestly, my favorite will always be ruby/sapphire
02D:
12And FTW seasons in Black
13Emerald > Ruby/Sapphire
7You and Night?
12Yes, atleast I'll try
rose?
06Emerald is a straight upgrade
7Actually, according to Steam, Rora and Feather are in-game.
oomg angel you just made me mad =\
02Ruby > Sapphire/Esmerald
12Yay
Haha
That was my first thought Ziltoid.
Emerald > Everything
IMO, S>R/E because in sapphire you can catch lunatone
and lunatone is awesome so :>
You can catch them all in Emerald
:p
02Also
06roara and feather are both playing on a valve server so
orly
02<Kosoveon> and lunatone is awesome so :> <--- Solrock is better
/me hides
no u ray D:
02xD
13I don't like either of them :3c
02you sick little floofcloud D:
12Okay, so how do I join the game? I already know how to play btw XD
he read pretty fast
06what
06floofcloud
Yeah,
!espeon
:3
.....I got nothin
13One thing I didn't like about R/S/E is that you don't ever get an Eevee
06and friends list, click the little arrow and it should say "Join Game"
12(moo)
!sneas !espeon !umbreon
13but you do in all the other games
13D:
7^@ Espeon.
02yeah, she reached a new level of Floofy-ness
12k
13But R/S/E was still amazing either way
!espeon
;3
06can also click View Game Info if you want more info about their server (so you don't desperately try to join a local one)
06No vee no fun
sadface
12Ah
02well..
r/s/e had the best music, imo
which is part of why i like that gen so much
thats a cool looking thing
7Jolly, Ray.
!umbreon

That status may or may not change in the near future.
MY BRAIN JUST Goozed out my ears again
03script kiddies are worse than n00bs though
I remembered that torchwood is anagram of dr who again
03as they're the type that go around thinking they're awesome when they're rally not
03*really
Why is that Dermathil?
ESTRELLA NOCTIS
>_>
Damn that picture!
inb4 the doctor rapes them with his sonic screewdriver
ive seen programs where u enter an ipaddress u can make a person lag out of runescape and kill them if you are fighting them for an unfair advantage
not saying, Pegacorn.
03First of all
03Runescape is a flash game.
I NEED ANWSERS.
meaning?
03All that does is do some server-side crap that pigngs them out.
03-g
NOPE
Lulz
03that has nothing to do with their computer
DEWEWEWEWEWE
GTFO PRESIDENT
lol
03it also means it's easily exploitable.
Kinda wish my RSS feed for EQD showed updates on story posts.
WANANANANANA.
...what status dermathil?
The shippy status
7Actually, DRF, it's Java.

i can no spell right
maybe Dman

03EW
/me punches Dermathil
03Java is even worse
GIVE ME ANWSERS!
FUCK NO
This is a secret.
The answer is 42.
SPOILERS=THE FUTURE....U WONT GET ANY SPOILERS
/me continues punching Dermathil until he gives him the anwsers.
/me tanks in the punches.
DAMN.
/me powers up his bass cannon
If that answer does not make sense, then clearly you are asking the wrong question.
03wtf?
03This commercial for the TurboPak
Hey mickey your rubbish
03something about some bullies trying to make a kid drink frog urine o_O
03commercials these days are just uncalled for
Od
Odd
Mickey or Rickey?
i honestly have no comment lol
pretty sure hes mickey
rickey is in season 2
03that and it was like a 2-minute commercial
03which would cost a lot of money
03as advertisers pay per the 30-second spot
Spoilers = he refers to himself as the doctor
03so that means it's 4x as expensive as a regular commercial
WHAT
/me fires lazor at pegacorn and destroys his molecular molecules
Dubtrotmaster - D D D D D D D D D D D
HAHAHAHAHA
molecular molecules! brilliant!
u seeme to be very down to earth drf :)

_ _ _ ' T ... _ _ _ ... _ _ _ _ ... A ... S T I T C _ ... I _ ... T I _ _ ... S A _ _ S ... _ I _ _ ?
03LOL this girl sounded like she didn't have an accent for a bit
GGgala you got it!
DEATH EARTH
03but then the accent came back
Production goof? :P
03well
spode
03it's an Australian show
03so naturally they all have Australian accents.
Naaah, cats > dogs
03No
What happened if they had austrian accents :P
inb4: girls in bikiniz
If they don't fit side by side at 100% then your screen is too small. :P
03^
03you konw what the biggest mystery is?
13It's impossible for someone to not have an accent~
/me runs

Hrm
03oh dear lord Degrassi
Second monitor is indeed too small. :(
03why do they even have that show
New theme squeezes a little extra on left and right. I guess before on 100% it JUST fit, and now doeesn't. It's not a problem at all
03my friend tells me it's about a bunch of high schoolers having sex
03which is like wtf

:P
drf: you have no idea how many times i would have loved to have kicked my sister out of this house
Because Dari likes the Doctor?

L4D Hunters.

sorry, I just thought there was some detail or in-joke i was missing.
I'd run away, but i know the police would find me
Next time someone synchtubes, I have the perfect set of videos to add.

Twi, why are you so clo-
I love how a simple typo can become a meme here.
THIS VID
we're meme sjuts, Pegacorn.

you konw what really grinds my gears, is that when my grandma comes here to get the clothes (Because she thinks my mom is helpless when shes not), she thinks she can insult me right infront of me
it's sjuts that ASKE is a new meme...sir

02insult her back?\

that turtle, now rubble
haha drf
>mushrooms
dat drug joke.
I've been called a worthless excuse for air before
ALSO this is incredible:
And that she has no right to say that
(g2 find it)

And you can report her for child harassment
03LOL @ that
03that's actually a nice insult
03I should try it on someone
http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/527393

>_______>
uuuuuhhhh....what?
what AE said
FOOTBAAAAAAWL
13And you refusing to do chores doesn't exactly help her view of that
dat cruisin'
AE, the fact that parents lose that respect doesn't help
also wtf is with grandparents and telling their grandchildren stupid news articles about stuff that kids our age do like play violent video games >_>
I might get into scuffles with my mom sometimes, but I know she loves me a lot and she does what she can for my schooling and my living
Kite pony?

13I'm pretty sure most of the girls only watch Twilight for the shirtless guys
13who aren't even good-looking
dari, you've got the honor.
12Speaking of Twilight, me and a couple of friends went to watch Vampires Suck just as a funny day out and I have to say the popcorn fight with a bunch of giggling girls was more entertaining.
Stuff like dinosaurs coming through portals in time
:P
13LOL
Anomalies.
lolwut
yeah
Is what they're called.
Well, there's not just dinosaurs.
13All I have to say about that movie is that the Jacob in Vampires Suck was more attractive than the one in the actual series LOL
Yeah, but it's mainly dinosaurs.
12LOL
Or big bugs.
there's also stuff from the (SPOILERS)
XD

Dermathil - yea man was great to watch! it's a show i watched semi while doing other stuff, but that's saying something, i don't watch much tv to begin with - it interested me.

So true Kosoveon
Cutter. ;___;
OH GOD NICK CUTTER Q_Q
I think i still prefer dr who, but if we already streamed it all, then i wouldn't mind it. still, maybe there's other shows people would want
although
sometimes it's impossible
im not realy a doctor who guy
like I saw the love guru once
eh
NEVER AGAIN
never cared for it
Depending on the people you're watching with too
true, I'm a big sci-fi nerd.
So I fell in love with Primeval
yeah
Should definitely stream some SG1 at some time though. XD
agreed
so much scifi i don't even know

12Anyone here watched Dogma?
Stream mlp G1

12Can't believe they're not making the sequel of Eragon =(
p'haps i will view if i have time
any thoughs on the robert downey jr film?
12Oh well, at least Inkspell is being released
No, stream G3.5
that was just an excellent dumb movie with style to spare
NO
Because Rainbow Dash always dresses in style.
NEVER
^ Already done a couple eps of 3.5
and I've seen eragon, i though it was alright
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT.gif
12It's a shame really, they could have made it so much better
*thought
lolwut?
Viewers were mad
The Eragon movie was horrible
Tears were shed
Lives were lost
Dari was mad.
I cried because I spent $30 on it
12LOL
That I saved up for months
o_O
You could tell.
on dvd?
12I enjoyed the book :3
Yeah
Shh
crap
:P
12Soital, when you visited my profile, was it broke? XD
that's gotta suck ._.
who streamed?
"I will last longer than the viewers... I will outlast them... I will stream more G3.5 until their eyes bleed!"
12Yes it was D:
12I wanted to poke you as well
12Ah XD
LolEragon
lol dari did?
Yup.
I like your style, dari.
The books were alright. I liked them when I was younger but I don't think I'd enjoy them now
You'll like my movie choice then too.
dari is a Celestia-tier troll.
12True xD it was ages since I read it
I fell asleep when I first watched it
If I get picked it's My Little Pony: The Movie

Well, according to my .co.cc version of the site.

I got stung by a stingray this summer. Just a true random comment. :D
Twilight is a square
13This song has been stuck in my head for ages now, to the point where I know all the lyrics to it
I am aware that RD is coolest and most awesome pony, my good sir, however it my humble opinion, i must state that she is not the best pony, and that Applejack certainly is not the worst pony.

No one's done a PMV for Michigan Rag yet?
Celestia's song is trololol
>to kick twice as much ass
If you didn't like Okami, you won't like Okamiden

I'd give Okami another chance though
My favorite game ever
wait, Dman... is Okami the game where you're the Sun Goddess who is also a wolf?
im back did i miss anything
I found it fun, but not very fun, and i am not even a gamer really
yes
i play SO LITTLE
like, last i played was portal 2, so little
i really rarely play : /
and is also Legend of Zelda esque?
GGgala i think so
yea ppl said it was zeldaesque
You play as a divine wolf who has to acquire various sacred powers in order to defeat the darkness
>yfw the wolf was hit by a friendship laser
yeah, that came out with a Nintendo DS sequel where you play her chibi male offspring
I hear one unlockable skin is original, nonartstyle wolf :P
or something
Yes, one of them is
really? i thought it was female too for DS . shows how much i know
one of them? 0_o
To the skins
oh ok

oh hai newdcd
9howdy bronies
nice!
NEWDCD!!!
9is dari streaming?
yeah
Torchwood
Sup Newdcd
9oic
eeyup
/me goes to look at comic
9if Dari is tired after this episode I might stream some vidya
After this episode, sure.
9also dari
9did you hear about Friday?
Nope.
9apparently the room has
9a 200 user cap
What room?
9we couldn't get any more in
9this one
...
It doesn't.
Bronystate
that would explain the errors I was geting on friday
9dari, we proved it on-site
we couldn't get more than 200 people in there
9when we hit the 200 mark
We've had more than that in before.
9we got "connection refused by configuration"
Also, it doesn't.
Yeah, we had people timing out and being denied entry like crazy.
So pinie pie is super saiyen?
9maybe it was set by accident man?
I guess his policy in defense is an all out offensive with water type Pokemon
9you should look into it
Nope.
It isn't on.
And hasn't ever been on.
9well
9something was denying entrance here
9and we couldn't get more than 200 users
well in battle
We've had more than that before, but it was solid at 200 on Friday. Never more.
Now it's on.
9so we still got to look into it
Oh.
lol pinkie is so random
You can't even limit the users.
9so what was the problem we were having?
No idea.
9it didn't let us have more than 200 users
Only thing I can think of is someone changed a network configuration.
LOLwhat
Well we could think about our own network.
DRF, who is that guy
I've got one set up.
9we should probably do that
9but still
9it's great to have you back
9we were totally panicking on Friday
Hmm.
I can't think of why it would limit to 200 users.
I'm not sure whether my internet can handle a server with 300 people connected though is the problem.
Eeyup
9dari, maybe we should move to an established IRC Server instead?
9one that can handle the load
9because I know that if I'm streaming
9I can't handle keeping a room up and so
03<junh1024> who's that dude?
03<usotsuki> Herman Cain, you mean?
03> it was a campaign speech, not?
03* azrael (a@p3EE2C126.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #pokemon-originals
03<bluesun> o
03<usotsuki> yeah, something like that
Well we can switch if you want.
also, yeah, epic-chat kept giving me "connection reset" starting five minutes before showtime and lasting until the last pony ep was almost over
I think it's a problem with mibbit though.
(i was using chatzilla)
How about more then one chat room?
I've never been DCed by the server when using mIRC.
would suck to be the first few over limit to be stuck in an almost empty room
9Ziltoid: that's the plan but we need to have rooms with variable user limits yet
9*first
I've had my connection to the server drop randomly at times. Can't confirm whether it was the server that was at fault, or my connection though.
Soon the stream will be viewed by thousands
Lol
dat baby
And the nronystate take over would begin
IMPLIED BABY DEATH
OH MY GOD
9Ziltoid: as I said, that's the plan, but let's say we make 6 rooms for 300 viewers each
THIS IS HORRIFYING
9if those fill out
9we're going to need to raise the cap a bit
9and later on make new rooms
9revert back to the cap, and so on
I've been more a fan of limiting the number of messages people can send than having seperate rooms though.
that was the presidential hopeful that quoted Donna Summer's The Power Of One
Since it's not really the same when you're splitting everyone up.
9I don't think that would be the best course of action. People would get bored more easily
so like a 40 sec throttle?
Something like that Ziltoid.
Thats what giantbomb doesw
WHAT?! Mibbit doesn't support DOS?! What bullshit is this?! I'm never using that shitty program again!
>program
lol
Yeah, yeah...
lulz
Implying mibbit is actually a program
Fingers were typing faster than brain was thinking.
9wait
9Dari
?
9that gives me a magnificent idea
trolololol
OH SHIT
9whydon't we combi-YOU DON GOUFD
good thing he is in a hospital
good place to be dying, really
9but yeah
9we should probably combine both concepts
TERMINATOR
9non-time limited, user number rooms
lawl
stabstab
poke poke poke
9bitch doesn't try to run away
9but yeah
implied child death
9non-time limited user limited rooms

Ahh.
Good idea.

12Insane_Lugia
spike take a letter
oh yeah did't see the second drive at first
12is there anyway to skip a slayer task in runescape?
hows it going?
lets kick ass
yes there is
dat fluttershy
12green dragons are just too hard
12not to mention i hate the wilderness
9didn't make the CMC because
9character creation slots are limited
no such thing as overkill
take that helpless shuttle
is that a space shuttle??
you have to go to the level 1 slayer master north of rouge's den and talk to him and he will give you a new one. you then do that task and you can get another from a higher level slayer master. option2: do smoking kills "quest" and when you do slayer task from "idk how to spellt he name sumona"
yup.
ok that top CnC looks like the one from seed
9THIS HOOF OF MINE GLOWS WITH AN AWESOME POWER
you will be able to unlock a system that lets you store slayer points over time enableing you to buy rewards from each task. you can cancle taksk and get a new one without going to the level 1 slayer masteretc.
burning finger!!!
trolololol
-blush- sorry runescape is just my thing X-D

But what's the difference between page source and info? :P
03Info makes it easier to find links to images and such

/me does stuff
Pattyrick do you lieks your WB?
did you fuck over databases or something?
10.0.1.40 as server is the only thing that works
well
That's because it's a local DNS server
i ran anope as root by mistake
lol

/me hugs Altair
alright
/me is running software program 4"Streets of Rage Remake" on 12Version 5 (Final construct) using compatibility mode for Windows 7
4hrs of sleep last night

and i have to get up at like 8
just gonna fix the DNS shit now
it's 3
Nope
derp
._.
pie
streets of RAEG wut
Can somebody please type the word pie?
oops
I crashed the server
shiiiiiiit
I hope Altair's still on
12pie
Yay, it works
Fuck sake -.-
god damnit
Altair
Whenever somebody types in the word pie, this iPhone will vibrate
Apparently restarting the network server
does crash it
-_-
yes
derp@(none):~$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
Running /etc/init.d/networking restart is deprecated because it may not enable again some interfaces ... (warning).
Reconfiguring network interfaces...SIOCDELRT: No such process
i need to wipe that init script
What happened?
Services down?
it uses a cache
whole fucking thing is down
yes
im too tired to fix it
._.
dhclient eth0
is all it needs
well
Gtg, bye er'body =d
Altair
the issue is
need to add that to boot as well
to fix it on start
it's not running properly
I need to refresh /etc/resolv.conf
after editing it to use the local bind9 server
Any other way to do it?
it's either typed up in a config somewhere to use 192.x
unlikely
or
it's cached
and no
i can't even ping it locally
It just died
i know
It probably froze
i got dc'd
and using 100% or something
from ssh lol
yeah
no
just net
weird
hm
See, it died after I ran /etc/init.d/networking restart
i know
lol...
Looks like something is fucking up after that happens
that script is fucked up
any idea why?
Yeah
i need to modify it
would sudo service networking restart be any better?
it uses cached dhcp info
i think
it doesn't run dhclient
on that script's start
That's weird
i know
also the bind9 server doesn't seem to be starting by default anymore
and it's a service so it should start
I have to manually /etc/init.d/bind9 start
i'll write another script tomorrow
maybe
hopefully
also
._____.
d'you have a temp fix?
update-rc.d
to addit
eh?
not atm
sigh
Well
to add a script to boot time
All it needs really
update-rc.d bind9 default
is resolv.conf edited
ah
s
ok cya
D:
nuuuu
can you start the server-

damnit
backup services
12night all~
heya Drake
I fucked Altair's server again
04NS, what have I told you about being a swinger?
04At least TELL me.
huh?
/me hides
lmfao
Also almost done
with Reminiscence ch24
04Yaaaay
04I've almost finished the summary for DoI
0420 pages and 11000 words
._.
that long?
04Yep.
even mine for Reminiscence wasn't that long
04Way too much detail but oh well
then again mine was just summaries
and jesus fuck portage is a bitch
04Mine's longer. It's basically a dummied-down chapter summary
apt is so much better
heh
04Each paragraph is a chapter, roughly
still not as long as Defeat
:p
04Reaching 25+ chapters
TCTL is 31 chapters
9118 words in ch24 of Reminiscence so far
04Nothing I do will ever be longer than Defeat
lmfao
defeat sucked
and 4915 for all the Reminiscence chapters
not including the sequel because I haven't done that yet
04XD
/me gonna be so happy
I just can't wait
04XD
04I thought you were depressed that it was ending?
until I finish Reminiscence
well true
but still
it's exciting to finally finish
the Epilogue is going to be awesome
It's all Lyon
04"Stay your blades gentlemen" *adjusts monocle*
lmfao
I should totally have him
wear a monocle
in the sequel
then I would lol every time he sees it
and then be like
04Heckyes
Lyon adjusted his monocle.
04Give him a fedora
04and a pimp cane
/me flees
lmfao
old Lyon
04He could be the new Giovanni!
rooooofl
>Lyon as Giovanni
mfw
04XD
Lyon is more like Kommander Kulesz I guess
Or...
THE HENSH
dun dun duuuuuuuuuuuuuun
04holy shit
04Lyon's not fat >:(
lmfao
he could get fat in 6 years
...7
04No
04he couldn't
he's 13 now
04>:(
._. My laptop is dying
lol
04He needs to smoke cigars
hahahahah
04so he can go 'Gentlement'
04Gentlemen*
is it bad when your laptop only charges to like 70% :S
that'd make Lyon the new Hensh
04XD
probably around 1 and a half hours
04Mine lasts 3 quarters of an hour.
04FML
it's 3-4 years old
lmfao
well yeah
unless you want Lyon to be the new Hensh
so you basically kept yours plugged in all teh time? derp
04But...cigars!
I don't think he'll be smokin' cigars or monocl'ng 'round the place
XD
and yeah
And Drake
The Hensh calls Kommander Kulesz sentimental
xD
04...LOL
.o.
There was a sadness in the Kommander's face that Lyon had never seen before. "Don't be...we all knew what was going to happen."
The Hensh chuckled, but it quickly turned into a pained cough. "You know, you are getting quite sentimental..."
04I don't know whether to laugh or cry
04He's dying
XD
they all make some sort of humourous jibe
And Drake
"Not the big bad Hensh anymore, are you?" Leonard smirked, and receive a similar look in return. "Yeah, well, take care as well, though I'm not sure how that'd work."
"Oh, I will, just don't count on it." The Hensh closed his eyes as his breathing slowed. "Just go hurry up and die so I can see you all again, will you?"
Silly, that's not how you spell 'everypony' =D
04...Awww
I seriously miss writing him
