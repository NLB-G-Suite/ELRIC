but none of his movies were ever A
did he make dune?
hm..
Because I think it counts as a movie
I mean an A movie
yeah he was in on Dune
00,02Alchemist, uh.... wierd looking movie
who'da thunk it
00,02its rated quite high
00,0291 on metacritic, 7.9 on imdb
He was mentioned, yeah
08,01i actually really like his Dune movie
00,02so i think it counts as A
It's a really very long time since I've seen Dune
08,01Lynch's movie had it's flaws, but it had great production values
08,01the Dune miniseries was book-accurate, but was terribly shot and acted
08,01so somewhere between the two lies perfection
00,02CrimsonPhoenix, don't see why it should
I do remember trying to read the books, maybe I should do that again.
Try reading a book and I'll hit you with it.
/me tries reading a book
hello

how old are you?
you can answer in PM if you wish
yes you
oh i'm ten
.....
I watch the show
ten
that's......wow
AND I CAN PROVE IT
?
We've had other people here that young
can't remember their names
I know about G4
that's the one I watch
no I do SNES
OOOOOOOH
parents kept it?
no, emulator...
oh....
that's.....a shame
I wish I had a real one though
That doesn't count. :P
how can you even comprehend the complex working of pony sociology and the intricate relationships between the mane six
I played the shit out of my SNES :3
But I have an SNES controller that I plug in
I still have my SNES
http://i.imgur.com/IPCa5.gif
You can still buy them
I think they cost around..3-400 dollars in Norway
as well as an Atari
refurbished of course
and THAT BRICK called NES
yeah...
I bought an atari 1year ago for 20$
Rainbow Dash
My sister threw the n64 at the wall
in my opinion
oh lawl
damn we all have different opinions XD
we only need Twilight and Fluttershy
it is all down to personal preference :3
I thought at least 2 people would agree with someone else
yeah, AJ's my second favorite
Twilight is my fav pony
Top 3 here is Fshy, PP and Rarity
and applejack is her best friend
DONT FUCKING DENY IT
:D
She is?
I never looked for their internal connections- maybe I should
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352041018010.jpg my reaction to Season 3
They're ALL her very best friends. Don't you listen to the intro?
Of course!
/me self slap
but APplejack cause Applejack actually apologized to twilight
^
cuz dey purple yo
And Spike
Cuz Spike is also purple
might
spike is a slave
The purple gang
Applejack needs her own episode
and song
considering she only had 1 episode
That is well established
derpy stole her last episode :P
not just Derpy
the others of the M6 was more in focus than she was
were*
!cd
Maybe, there's been a minor arc in the others
I'm not crazy about any of the VA's, but I like their work, don't know any of their personalities
um, no
ok
cause season 3 is going to be disapointing
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352025615240.jpg
I think S2 was leaps and bounds over S1 in quality
Of course, that's natural
but- I really couldn't care less about the popularity of the show, as long as it has a steady income and get's to run itself out
people are still surprised by that fact
season 1 had the highest quality
I disagree
i mean look at Spongebob, PPG and Rugrats
Hi evedrybody :)
I really can't tell. When it comes down to it, Season 1 nearly equals Season 2
HERROW
Everything ends sometime, but it's not something you sit around and think abot in my opinion
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352003079677.png
I think Season 2 had a lot more 'entertaining' episodes while season 1 had a lot of character development/morals
season 1 is far surperior to season 2
Not really
0,5I prefer Season 2
but yeah S1 had more moral lessons
0,5For it is superior
I also think S2 upped the quality of direction and animation
production value
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352022368437.jpg
Season 1 has it's epic moments, but Season 2 improved in animation and in pay-off
And no, we don't need to prepare for anything, things end when they end and we deal with it then
I'm gonna go stream now. But regulary no one watches me stream and sometimes I don't.
Definitely was improvement. I think there was improvement even throughout the first season
Totally
that's why people like it
Hey guys, i'm back
that's an issue the simpsons got hammered with in s4
0,5I actually got into ponies a couple months before S2 began
If anyone remembers me, that is :o
it's--just how it is
0,5So I was able to go through season 1, wait a little while, and then go into S2 :P
I got into ponies a few episodes into s2
DDC3
anyway, i bet you guys
There wasn't as much dev I guess, the characters were established, but I did see some wonderful changes in character throoughout season 2
months*
I got into ponies a week before Luna Eclisped, can you guess my favorite pony
Luna
I got into ponies months ago
I can not remember the first live episode I saw
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352010793226.gif
But my first live episode was Read It And Weep
oh yeah, for sure
I dont even have a TV...
^
11,01Hey there.
And I really connected to Rarity during Sisterhooves Social. Another fav for me.
I loved that episode
but my first episode was ''May The Best Pet Win''
then i got into the PILOT
the first episode i SAW was episode 1 season 1
good o' pilot. I remember watching it and I think I instantly loved it with Twilight's personality
Twilight took a while for me <,<
twilight is best pony
I think Baby Cakes was a great episode for Pinkie-
HEy guys.
Actually the characters always do/show something that keeps changing my position towards them.
lol. Baby Cakes was great.
look at me now
Good thanks mate.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8126/
11,01Read it and Weep.
0,5MadSurge: No
0,5:I
ANything to avoid reading
Huh an Australia
Vic or NSW?
Anyone check out the Trotmania?
Niether :P
NT?
I know.
I liked Luna Ecplised, but it is one I rarely rewatch-
/me strokes Jmo's tongue
wat.
I definitely connected with Luna. I think they played her character great.
0,5I just feel like it was a sudden wierd thing
brb, gotta go shopping
I hate luna(not a lot but you know a little) Because she never comes in the show a lot except for the halloween one
but- that can be kinda nice
I don't downright dislike any episodes, but there are ones I skip when rewatching
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5698/
Hearth's warming eve is actually one of my top 10 in s2 I think
Lol

http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5008/
Nou
It wasn't hated, it was just--nothing happened in that episode
and RD was a bit more of a bitch than usual
The heck?
Bitcherdash
I don't think they were
me neither, maybe RD's character was a bit exaggerated but thats it.
I think the people said 8/10 after initial air

Really? I really liked that one- even if I think Flim and Flam was a bit unfairly treated, but they WERE conning-
I looved that song though-
Dont get it
proobably
Hehe yeah, it was LONG
I gotta' go.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2689/
We were like "Wait, that's half the episode!"
flim flam is glorious for the talent of the singer
SERIOUSLY
They were grreaat singers
It was ONE singer? O_o
it has a really good showtune feel to it
but still
Yeah, I like that angle of it
but- I enjoyed watching it the first time, but I do tend to skip it
Drunk FlimFlam singer > all

I'd like a Pinkie-centered episode where she's not a complete bimbo.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1651/
I think she was good in Baby Cakes
^
Yea that ep was awesome
Then poor pinkie....cryed...:'(
yeah that and
when Twilight took her hat?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1324/
it was nice to see her have emotions and reactions like that

http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7772/
What's up?
Anyone find Fluttershy to be creepy?
me
eyes*
I find Pinkie Pie to be creepy
sometimes
The Fiction That Shalt Not Be Named made sure of that for me.
SHHHHH!
My favortie pony is either Applebloom, Applejack or Fluttershy.
You don't want to say it here. It's dangerous.
We all know Twilight is best pony
Luna is favorite and best pony.
STOP MISSPELLING PINKIE
rainbow dash is best pony
Twilight is best pony -3-
4chan defiled the name of Rainbow Dash.
RD is worst pony
Pinkie is creepy and sometimes annoying, Rarity is full of herself and Rainbow Dash is even more full of herself
Tab fail
138
lol ik
hi
Hi everyone!
(\
Rarity is a drama queen, Rainbow Dash is a hard head, Twilight has PSD, Applejack is Applejack, Fluttershy is too cute(not even sure if possible), and Pinkie has ADD, ADHD, and eats too much sugar.
no lol
You're welcome.
imo applejack is best background pony

Twilight has like 8
Applejack sang in Winter Wrap Up. There is no excuse.
but its not HER song
^
background ponies cant have songs
Derpy got a song
way
wat?
she did?
Well fanmade ones
When Applejack finally got a S2 episode, Derpy stole the show. I don't not like derpy I'm just saying
everypony sang in winter wrap up
ur face is a skew
I can't remember the rest LD
:D
Derpy?
Derpytroll
Askew.
nah
Is the endless stream buffering happening to everyone?
i'll stay with derpy
I fine with both
Cung Foo
Stupid parents
the third lol
because heck yeah royalty
terrific
well that was easy
Trixie has been confirmed in S3
:\
Hm, k.

Trixie needs to be Luna's protege

DAYUM
HOMOSEXUALITY IS CANON
hey everyone :)
eyelashes
oh my niock is changed
99.99% of Equestria is female
everyone at that age gives everyone valentines
TwistxTruffle Shuffle?
No!
^
Not in thi scountry, we don't give them at all
inb4 Equestria bans gay marriage. inb4 ponies do it anyway. inb4 half of the population is on the moon.
Seems legit.
08,01how is homosexuality canon?
i find the valentine thing stupid
Not me :'(
oh hi Saturn :)
08,01the picture?
Someone repost it.
I am too lazy.
hugs http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5630/
not that one
and we're talking about this picture http://i.imgur.com/WPtcH.png
Saturn: http://i.imgur.com/WPtcH.png
Stallions in Equestria are rare to say the least
stallions are like 20% of equestria
More like 5%
Considering the ratio of female to male, I still don't see how there would still be homosexual males running around.
inb4 ten on one.
5% male ratio
5% is impossible
More like 15%.
10% the most
20% is appropriate
Because most of them are most likely living in the other cities.
Do you like me? yes definetly ABSOLUTLY
I pick neither.
:3
40%
I RIGGED IT
there's no shortage of stallions or mares
i hear faint noises in my headphones... i'm scared
35% the most
/me brain break
bye guys :)
Back
That actually makes a lot of sense... make this fiction. NOW.
*fan fiction*
/me goes back to reading shipping
/me goes back to reading creepypasta
/me always thought pasta was creepy
twin*
/me thinks that pasta wants to kill him while he is asleep
do we have a stream
no
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH
Celestia stoned him because he dumped her
It's quite an old fanon
Lyra/BonBon confirmed in S3?
Coldn't say if I knew
Pretty sure Lyra/BonBon was confirmed in S2
confirmed as close friends yeah
"___ __" Pinkie said.
but I like to think they're a couple
Applejack?
'realistic view'
and comedy
by they you mean he?
yeah won't read
I really wish they made DiscordXCelestia canon
and no please
clopfics REALLY scare me...
just
no
why would he put a manticore when Luna is coming to town
Because he enslaved ponies for generations?
I don't like parodies, but I'm sure that would be a hit
and there is this R34 parody on the works.......
...
yea that;s it
I would recommend you guys to drop this subject
^
drop it
ok
]
I guess that episode made sex canon...
>implying that the ponies ever had sex in the first place and are not all offspring of Celestia.

Hi, Good afternoon everyone
T
Belief is believing in something. That something can be anything, but it's still a belief. ._.
i believe this agument needs to stop
I believe we should stop this
lets change topic.....
Lets talk about our theories of the ponyverse/Equestrias history, instead.
Is there nothing else of interest to talk about?
SSHHHHHHH
Lets change the Topic pls
Great another debate
Anyone wanna place bets?
I tried to get everypony talking about 40k, but noooooooo!:D
34
Anything can be sexified or something
Yeah Rule 34
Its R34
aaaaanyway
If it exists, there's a porn of it, no exceptions.
^
We've gone from belief to R34? Is there nothing else to discuss? XD
R34.2 is if it exist there is a pony of it
The exception is r35
eeyup*
It was all fun and games untill you brought in the rules ._.

Only Link can defeat Ganon!
00,10they are still filming the how to make a dimond ep, check back in a few eons
or was it only a paper?
13so really, diamonds aren't terribly valuable, the price comes from the huge effort needed to make them pretty
>Show up on my credit card bill
13veemi pauses for about a second every five.-.
what's a carat in grams?
pauses for me too
00,10I am seeing that

i can't help all i get is a 404 screan
Saturn: Aand...?
08,01Vordox: more sugar! \o/
Saturn: I have TONS of sugar...

scary
WHAAT?
00,10like down to both dieing at the same time
00,10more like same pompany diffrent name
08,01i've been writing in cursive since i was about 8
08,01i still suck at it.
^
same here
*^^^
I write italics because it pisses off my teachers
i was told all the time i would be using cursive for everything as i grew older
^
08,01in my previous job, i used to write requisition orders, etc. in crayon
08,01it pissed off my boss no end
Italics is where its at
00,10but it was just all the loading of diffrent confix that killed my fmle
In crayon:D
Italics is diagonaly right?
I got stream
Slanted, if I remember.

08,01all americans sound the same anyway

13i'm just going to stop thinking... daylight savings screwed my body clock..
last time i got angry i broke my chair and ripped my headphones apart
13pff all you scots are drunk anyway
/me 13casual alcoholism

^lul
08,01200ths on an inch?
08,01that the fuck kind of measurement is that?
13less than millimeter i believe
132/100"
how it's made paper?
00,10needs more reverb to sound like cave
doors
13Saturn: 0.508 millimeters
08,01ah, okay
13Vordox: mehhhhh
13go back in time and do it
this is MURRIKA
In America, there's no difference than casual racism and blatant KKK-calibur bigotry.
we use MURIKAN measurements here
Er, no difference between
they dont use metric, not for everything at least, in england either
13we use metric for everything scientific, imperial for temperature and carpentry
we even use microwaves to make doors....
Saturn: Like Gallons and Stones? :P
13easier to use fractional widths than mount the decimals of meters
00,02Shizuka, imperial is silly
its not just america, but yeah, metric ftw
imperial is overall silly
00,10you dont need precision in home construtcion
Construtcion ftw
As he left, a lone eagle perched upon their doors, signalling the truth of MURIKAN heritage.
all these colors lol
08,01heh
08,01knob.
13i did see a discussion on it though, on why carpenters don't use metric
there was a closing ceremony?
Silly Saturn
13it has to do with fractions of an inch that i recall
i thought they canceleld it
13something about that is easier to work with
08,01Vordox: i don't use gallons or stones
00,10how balls are made
08,01i use litres and kilos
Saturn: I know some English people use the older English measures
PAINTBALL
AW SHIT
then dont say it :D
13the bigger reason is imperial has inertia
Meh, I never liked Paintball.
08,01one of the stupidest measurements ever is miles/gallon
Tasty tasty paintballs
13it's the measure of distance traveled per unit of fuel consumed
08,01Shizuka: because it's doubly unworkable in metric
boy, look at all that maple syrup
paintballs=dibstep
13yeah well
dubstep*
13we invented cars
13SO THERE
00,10not sure if case or filler
Paintballs = shit?

Am I the only person with normal vision?
08,01Shizuka: pics?
13hahano
08,01:P
I used to wear them, still got them because they are designer ones.
I also wouldn't mind replacing my eyes with cybernetic equivalents.

08,01*all* of it.
13uh..
13don't think they ever told me <<
lol
00,10but popplers are people too
Saturn, did you know all of this already?
/me 08,01is -2.75 and -2.5

I'd have to be wearing... FARADAY SHADES!
13i think the right
Because ew, chocolate.
the making of a guitar?
13whichever one means i blur two feet in front of me <<
08,01CrimsonPhoenix: not really, but i know how to make a cello
I look at burgers hungrily
13i always forget if nearsighted means you see near or can't see near
AND DONT YOU DARE STREAM IT!!!!!!!!!!!!

00,10and yes Saturn i am a chef

Isn't it like, 4AM in Scotland right now Saturn ?
40 hours job? .-.
40 hour work week
13the fireworks bit is actually kind of boring, gunpowder into a shell, then more gunpowder, then more gunpowder, then wrap in paper
I am not even sure I wanna see the stream that everyone's watchign that's making y'all freak out.
13then stock footage of fireworks
08,01what?!
13Kurra: that bit's over now :)
08,01fireworks are really interesting!
Igot a couple of uncles that work at the Timaru freezing works...
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7481/
13Saturn: they are, just not the way they show it <<
13it's all procedural, none of the design aspect
00,10so they cant show much
13that too
fireworks are awesome california's firework laws are not
13there was a special on discovery or maybe history about fireworks
00,10bleh fiberglass
00,10sucks if you get that crap on you
13fiberglass, asbestos 2.0
Saturn: I guess if you don't show how the fireworks are designed or how the chemicals are developed and made it'd be kinda boring
nooooo
fiberglass isn't that bad, it's the polyester resin that's riddickilous
08,01drink everytime he says 'fibreglass'

08,01NullRadix: now, i'm addicted to procrastination
13Saturn: "i'm going to get drunk......later"
00,10it was from the last ep of an anime that got cencored at it's most violent part
hrm... not sure if oxymoron...
Saturn: But then i found ponies and that became my addiction
D'aww :'3
13ah yeah that one
13because the series was too similar to something that had just happened in japan
A dryer?
00,10because the part in the anime resembled a reallive event that had just happend
Dat Transoformer toilet paper

PUMPKIN PIEEE
...oh fluff now I want that.
OK bye guys. :)
Au revoir, mes amis et à demain~
I rarely ever dream :(
Pumpkin pie is meh
pumpkin pie <3
pumpkin pie is all that is tasty in this land
Bye. :)
and then*
13i was working on a mass fab
at the base of every tasty food errwhere, there is pumpkin pie :>
13blew up the mass fab pretty good
pizza pie. See? Pie there
why do people take pictures of food?
PEE
FUCKING
ZA
eww pee.
bummer. makes sense though
they should have flavored pictures
now thats a good idea
Call it "My Little Dashie"
well I had a dream that there was monster eating all of the people around me
baad hoodie!
13all this with being able to put ore into a pouch
13that teleports home
Then turned into a kettle
The end
13one stack goes in, two stacks come out
i had a dream that i was at school twas horrible
I don't recall ever having a good dream in years. All the dreams I can really remember are sad dreams or dreams where I died. :D
lol
:D?
lol
well my worst one was probably that my parents were killing all of their children and I was the only one left ;_;
All dese dreams
13pondering
All my dreams are in 7.1 surround sound with 64-bit color, and pain sensation.
my only pony dream was about fluttershy going around selling gum and getting excited ever time she made a sale :)
dreams can never become a reality you know
i remember one dream where i was actually a pony, and everyone hated me
every*
I remember night frights
08,01i had a dream where i was on stage with KISS
08,01but we all had Viols
08,01i could play the Viol, but didn't know any KISS songs
Saturn: Oh I know this story!
08,01i used to play in a Viol consort, and i have no idea about KISS songs
not everynight
/me dreamt a few times of ponies. Has very dim memories of crying with one, possibly because it was a dream, and was destined to end.
beat that
just twice a week sprunkls
well my weirdest dream included a catapult, a witch, and my brother which ended with me getting stabbed in the stomach and I actually felt it
Ultra hax
/me had an out of body experience once, except he can't prove it was because he had foreknowledge of a hidden pice of paper he 'found' in the OOBE
isn't his name Ghostface
and not Scream?
yesh :3
......
Kittens?
Apparently, Hellsing suddenly stops at episode 13 >.<
O_O;
Saturn: o.o
08,01she was warm and comforting
ABANDON THREAD
do not want to hear how end. D:
meant to*
Saturn: Was it that kind of dream, or just normal?
Saturn: i bet she would be, sun goddess and all that lol
08,01it wasn't *that* kind of dream...
/me whew
Saturn: Okay. JUst making sure. Sorry.
08,01it was more like she bestowed this great sense of inner peace on me
08,01stayed with me when i woke up, and i had a really good day
Saturn: aaaaw
:D
no idea
GO HOME SQUID! YOU'RE DRUNK!
Can I ask...what song is this? and the past two?
also this music is epic here....
/me fuck yeah
Saturn: Actually, I would like to have that dream. It would seem nice to talk to Celestia.
DAYUM
13flutterchu: .....
:D
........
..............
08,01fortunately, this wasn't like The Unicorn Dream
^
Saturn: Wow......that seems like a pretty good dream.
13i have all the OSTs for Haibane Renmei in winamp atm
what's that?
08,01which is waaaay to horrible for this channel
^
/me thinks of his most favorite dream ever ever EVER
Or is it still playing?
But if Celestia is warm in Saturn's dream...
13basically infinite power source
If one dreamed about Luna, would she be cold?
00,10magic, got it
13yep
You know, since she raises the moon?
13useful for prototyping
08,01AJIsAwesome: why would Luna be cold?
Saturn: Misping. :)
00,10I been having issues with my oil rigs exploding
13also found out it can dump enough power into a mass fab to build a stack of UU in like fice seconds
13all the engines are buildcraft electrical
squid
dat squid
00,10it's mostly cooling issues
Saturn, I don't know. I meant cold to the touch in a way. I guess it's just me overthinking
00,10the problem with pipes decoupling on relog
ive yet to dream of ponies .-.
08,01AttackWithHugs: i think Luna has a warm disposition; she's mostly just misunderstood
00,10but dont think it works like that
how do you make yourself have a dream?
13actually looks like the electrical engine is pretty cheap
I have no idea.
13just needs tin
00,10in tekkit
suddenly wallsplosion
tl;dr
13there's adjustable electrics
13like three tiers i think
*cuombustion
Saturn, I have no problem believing that Luna would make for a pony that could connect with you in a way.
another time i dreamed of BFDIA 4, but it actually wasnt how i imagined and i KNOW i was going to be wrong
00,10you get enough power from a redstone toarch to run a refinner?
redstone engine
?
13refiner is running off the electrics over there
13ten electrics
13dunno where they rank compared to the combustion engines though
Saturn : ooohh
08,01he was about the same age as he was in TNG, and we were on a train... wrestling...
13redstone's just running the pumps
08,01and that's where i'm stopping that story.
well I had to resort to combustion becaue they otheres keeped exploding once I provided power :(
Saturn: He beat you, didn't he
saturn: O_O
Its alright, don't be ashamed
Saturn http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2657/ X3
13wooden pipe is good for that
13overheating from lack of cooling is a different problem though
Saturn : http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5796/
might be the cooling
D8
13saw this coming
oh noes!
13the momentum processors are pretty buggy i've found
13uh oh
aww
I feel falling when I dream
dont say that
uh oh?
13crap.. those machines borked the world..
oh uh
oh
ho hu
dayum
hh ou
And it crashes
anyone else ever feel it when there stabbed in a dream?
13btw if anyone knows where to find this in dual screen size, let me know
I wouldnt be on right now either if I ended up moving toda
today
Most of my nightmares involve me falling and being to weak to stand up
heh i once had a dream of epicly fighting a anime cyborg girl
yeah :/
:D!
08,01freaky fucking things
13i'll check
/me dreams of work often :)
00,10but yeah I think that is a FTB only item
13almost feel like zonking out to some cosmos..
/me doesn't dream enough or doesn't end up remembering which dreams he had >.>
13the rotary macerator is an Advanced Machines thing, technic and tekkit have it
lol
I
Fucking
tekkit has the Rotary Mac, yes
Gum
doesn't have the Electical Engine yet though
13it has three from Power Converters
my dreams have gotten significantly more unpleasant ever since i played skyrim..
tekkit has the Engine Generators - BC --> EU/t
not the electrical engine - EU/t --> BC. still have to use energy links on that
i had one absolutely disgusting dream a few months ago..
Haven't had a dream in... months now
i have a dream every night and i dont like it
13mmm no it does have a EU/t -> MJ engine in tekkit
13i used it on the last world
NONONONO
WAIT NONONONO
00,10yeah I cant seem to figure out how to make Eu - refiner work
This song has samples of the planning music from Rainbow Six! :O
13transformers mod

http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs20/i/2007/231/f/5/baby_banjo_and_kazooie_by_nintendrawer.jpg

and i say heeyeahhyeahhh
13tekkit doesn't have a few of the technic mods that are/were SP only
