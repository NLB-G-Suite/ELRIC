Phase4: I plan to vote for this as the next B movie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylzO9vbEpPg do you think its eligible or should I bother someone else with this question?
we should have an all david lynch movie night
but none of his movies were ever A
did he make dune?
hm..
I don't thnk so, maybe
Because I think it counts as a movie
I mean an A movie
yeah he was in on Dune
He was actually up for 8 oscars with The Elephant Man
00,02Alchemist, uh.... wierd looking movie
Huh, he made a music video for X Japan
who'da thunk it
00,02its rated quite high
Phase4: its a cannes film festival winner I think
00,0291 on metacritic, 7.9 on imdb
08,01we talkin' aboot david lynch?
He was mentioned, yeah
08,01i actually really like his Dune movie
00,0296 on rotten tomato
00,02so i think it counts as A
It's a really very long time since I've seen Dune
08,01that's the thing though, we've not really had a perfect interpretation of Dune at all yet
Phase4: thanks, I will vote for it as an A movie then
08,01Lynch's movie had it's flaws, but it had great production values
I can barely remember anything- so I can't say my opinion on it, but it seems to have had a good reception
08,01the Dune miniseries was book-accurate, but was terribly shot and acted
Phase4, doesn't the foreign factor count?
08,01so somewhere between the two lies perfection
I love the style though
00,02CrimsonPhoenix, don't see why it should
I do remember trying to read the books, maybe I should do that again.
Try reading a book and I'll hit you with it.
I do like some of lynch's stuff, and I like some of the ideas- but like Twin Peaks fire walk with me? Did not like it
Jmo what?
/me hits Jmo with book-heart
/me tries reading a book
hello

Some here don't when they say that

That's rubbish infernap12
Vivix, I'm the JOker
Who the hell stacks monitors
no, from a little place called MARYLAND!
I want to put a smile on your face
imagine it with 4 more
MARYLAND YEAH
2 on each side
But joker hurts when he makes you smile-
zackthebrony, who's Alex Kidd?
Vivix, that's the thing
? what crimson
I don't know who the "Alex Kidd" os
zackthebrony, Alex Kidd is one of Sega's mascot
*is
oh
god damn I need to get with the program XD
/me is not a retrogamer

how old are you?
I had a sega, and I think I played sonic, but I can't remember

yes you
oh i'm ten
I write fan fic
.....
I watch the show
ten
hell yeah
but i'm a true brony
that's......wow
AND I CAN PROVE IT
?
We've had other people here that young
can't remember their names
no wonder you don't know about G4 and prior
I know about G4
that's the one I watch
it's like Retro for you is Gamecube
no I do SNES
OOOOOOOH
Retro is a hipster thing, so retro is 1989-1999
parents kept it?
no, emulator...
oh....
that's.....a shame
I wish I had a real one though
That doesn't count. :P
how can you even comprehend the complex working of pony sociology and the intricate relationships between the mane six
I played the shit out of my SNES :3
nothing is better than the true console itself
But I have an SNES controller that I plug in
I still have my SNES
true Crimson, so true
LUCKY
http://i.imgur.com/IPCa5.gif
You can still buy them
I don't have an SNES as well but I did have a Genesis
ebay
I think they cost around..3-400 dollars in Norway
WHAT WAS THAT BRONYSITH XD
as well as an Atari
refurbished of course
and THAT BRICK called NES
I think my mum got rid of my SNES as she is a horrible human being...
yeah...
I used to have a Genesis, but I left it with my mom and sister when I moved out.
well, its getting late, night everyone
who is best out of the mane six?
and my nintendo 64 :c
Bye infernap12 :)
I bought an atari 1year ago for 20$
zackthebrony: applejack
zackthebrony, Rarity of course
Rainbow Dash
My sister threw the n64 at the wall
in my opinion
zackthebrony: Pinkie
oh lawl
damn we all have different opinions XD
hey Gold_Demona how are you today sister?
we only need Twilight and Fluttershy
it is all down to personal preference :3
I thought at least 2 people would agree with someone else
that's so true bro
But I like AJ :3
Bronysith: Doing alright. Just hangin' out and stuff.
yeah, AJ's my second favorite
Gold_Demona: yay
Twilight is my fav pony
Top 3 here is Fshy, PP and Rarity
and applejack is her best friend
DONT FUCKING DENY IT
:D
Bronysith: technically, yes she is
She is?
Yeah, and so are the other four. :D
I never looked for their internal connections- maybe I should
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352041018010.jpg my reaction to Season 3
They're ALL her very best friends. Don't you listen to the intro?
Of course!
/me self slap
I wonder, though, who she hangs out the most with
but APplejack cause Applejack actually apologized to twilight
^
cuz dey purple yo
true facts :3
Bronysith: yet still, it might JUST MIGHT be intended that the rest appologized before the RECEPTION.............just saying MIGHT
And Spike
Cuz Spike is also purple
Dark92Enigma: nope
might
spike is a slave
The purple gang
Bronysith: lol.....we'll see when he gets his next focus episode
Applejack needs her own episode
and song
considering she only had 1 episode
That is well established
derpy stole her last episode :P
not just Derpy
Bronysith: and then you say: she'll never have it''
the others of the M6 was more in focus than she was
Dark92Enigma: cause she wont
were*
true
just like Scootaloo
Bronysith: not in the short term.....
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 5 days, 23 hours, 55 minutes, 30 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352000824072.png I LOVE YOU TARA
i have a feeling....that season 3 will have a story-arc
i have a feeling season 3 will suck
lol Bronysith
Maybe, there's been a minor arc in the others
Bronysith: don't we all love her?
Bronysith: Don't jinx it. :<
I'm not crazy about any of the VA's, but I like their work, don't know any of their personalities
Bronysith: i have a feeling you will be a TROLOLOLOLOLO until S3 premiers
um, no
ok
cause season 3 is going to be disapointing
Either they will A) Go downhill like Spongebob B) Give us what we want C) Squeeze in new stories that don't make sense
I have a feeling Bronysith will feel a feel http://i.imgur.com/h7SFV.jpg
Bronysith, if you hype it up too much yes
im not hyping it up
Bronysith want's it to be a disappointment, because then his worldview is correct
Bronysith: then you will be a TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO until S3 ends
/me cue the song
There will be disappointed people, beacuse it's no longer new, but- most people won't be, I sure as hay won't be
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352025615240.jpg
I think S2 was leaps and bounds over S1 in quality
OK, tbh there WILL be a time when the show loses popularity
Of course, that's natural
Bronysith, your link made me so jealous
Dark92Enigma, there will be a time when the show get's cancelled
but- I really couldn't care less about the popularity of the show, as long as it has a steady income and get's to run itself out
people are still surprised by that fact
season 1 had the highest quality
I disagree
i mean look at Spongebob, PPG and Rugrats
Hi evedrybody :)
hai The_Engineer
I really can't tell. When it comes down to it, Season 1 nearly equals Season 2
HERROW
HERROW ENGINEER
YOU FIX CAR FOR ME?
Everything ends sometime, but it's not something you sit around and think abot in my opinion
YES, YOU FIX CAR
S1 is good, really good, but I think s2 is better, don't know what S3 will be yet
/me face hooves
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352003079677.png
I think Season 2 had a lot more 'entertaining' episodes while season 1 had a lot of character development/morals
season 1 is far surperior to season 2
Not really
0,5I prefer Season 2
but yeah S1 had more moral lessons
0,5For it is superior
CrimsonPhoenix: i ......try not to think about it. :(
Dark92Enigma, I'm sorry but you need too
I also think S2 upped the quality of direction and animation
production value
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352022368437.jpg
You need to prepare your spirit so you won't get depressed by one show
That spin during Putting Your Hoof Down freaked me out!
^^
Season 1 has it's epic moments, but Season 2 improved in animation and in pay-off
And no, we don't need to prepare for anything, things end when they end and we deal with it then
CrimsonPhoenix: i guess you're right
I'm gonna go stream now. But regulary no one watches me stream and sometimes I don't.
Yeah, I loved s1, without it, I wouldn't be a fan of the show, but I do think s2 was an improvement
Dark92Enigma, also there will be other show you could jump into and love
Definitely was improvement. I think there was improvement even throughout the first season
Totally
season 1 was something new fresh
dunno, S2 was certainly better aesthetically, but it got kinda stale in character building.
that's why people like it
as seasons progress it will stop being fresh
Hey guys, i'm back
that's an issue the simpsons got hammered with in s4
0,5I actually got into ponies a couple months before S2 began
If anyone remembers me, that is :o
people started to say "I hate this season, this sucks" but after four years they said "I loved s4 but I hate this new season"
it's--just how it is
Welcome back Nabronyan
0,5So I was able to go through season 1, wait a little while, and then go into S2 :P
Alchemist: I think the problem was that some episodes was just so jam-packed with references and fun, that afterwards they felt a little hollow.. as if you didn't connect with the characters
I got into ponies a few episodes into s2
I wanna go play a game
so now i'm gonna play
DDC3
It was the same for me BaconMane
anyway, i bet you guys
zackthebrony: play mechwarrior online :P
I started watching just a couple monthsw before S2 started.
Is anything streaming? Also, what are you guys talking about? :l
There wasn't as much dev I guess, the characters were established, but I did see some wonderful changes in character throoughout season 2
months*
same here BaconMane i got into he show about a month before season 2 and
Nabronyan: discussing how we feel about season 3 when relating seasons 1 & 2
Its almost time for S3
I got into ponies a week before Luna Eclisped, can you guess my favorite pony
6 days
Luna
CrimsonPhoenix: which?
SpeccyRush: lol. Same as I
I got into ponies months ago
flutter_spin: that wasnt really the case for me. Its just that the characters became a bit inconsistent and flavorless. They still have some pretty damn good moments, but I dont feel much progression or complexity.
SpeccyRush: Granny Smith >_>
I can not remember the first live episode I saw
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352010793226.gif
Hay bronysith
I got in a little later, started watching the week when The Cutie Pox aired, and my first "waiting" episode was May The Best Pet Win
Dark92Enigma, I cannot predict the future but clearly there will be other shows
hi Nabronyan
welcome back Nabronyan !
Gold_Demona: no but same VA
I didn't get that feeling Alchemist, but- different people notice different things I suppose
SpeccyRush: I was joking. :P
flutter_spin: and dont get me wrong, I think its still a pretty good show.
Alchemist: Personality shifts. Definitely.
But my first live episode was Read It And Weep
Gold_Demona: iknow "P
CrimsonPhoenix: true.....there is ALWAYS a reason to watch TV
oh yeah, for sure
my first live episode was MMMMMMMMMystery on the friendship express
I don't watch TV, other than MLP really-
Anyone remember when The Cutie Pox aired?
I dont even have a TV...
i tried to watch Ponyville confindential but failed
I love Fluttershy, so Dragonshy will always be one of my favorite episodes.
^
Fluttershy is PONI
I thiink..my first live episode waas..Cutie Pox or May the best pet win
/me 11,01glomps Bronysith
/me glomps Nittany_Discord back
.....anyway i bet you guys that the two-parter WILL have SEVERAL Sailor Moon references
Cutie Pox was my first
Nittany_Discord: hello aniki
hi Nittany_Discord
11,01Hey there.
Cutie Pox aired-- 2011 10 22
And I really connected to Rarity during Sisterhooves Social. Another fav for me.
I loved that episode
but my first episode was ''May The Best Pet Win''
then i got into the PILOT
the first episode i SAW was episode 1 season 1
but first live I saw was Cutie Pox
good o' pilot. I remember watching it and I think I instantly loved it with Twilight's personality
Twilight took a while for me <,<
I didn't dislike her, but I didn't love her
twilight is best pony
I dont even know if I have a favorite character. I just cant settle for one, but on derpibooru on my upvoted list AJ has the most pictures.
I will always say Twilight is best pony, Fluttershy is my favorite pony.
I love them all, but I think Fshy and Rarity- Pinkie are the ones I love the most
Pinkie I will always adore, but she reminds me of my step-sister
I think Baby Cakes was a great episode for Pinkie-
HEy guys.
Vivix: well of course :D
she's not always crazy and hyper, she gets tired and responsible too
Actually the characters always do/show something that keeps changing my position towards them.
lol. Baby Cakes was great.
Anyone seen SuperBrony?
IN FACT, before watching a FULL episode (May the Best Pet win) someone at high school showed me part 2 of S2 premiere......there's when i started to get interested BEFORE watching a full one.......
Ohay Loopy_Legend
0,5I enjoyed the episode with daring do
Daring Do was grreaat episode
/me i said : I might...........might GIVE THIS SHOW A CHANCE
how are things Loopy_Legend
look at me now
Daring Do was fun. I think I rated it like 20 on my list.
BaconMane: you mean Luna Eclipsed? :D
Good thanks mate.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8126/
0,5I liked when Dashie was bored and she was bouncing the ball against the wall and clicking the lamp to stay entertained
11,01Read it and Weep.
0,5MadSurge: No
0,5:I
ANything to avoid reading
Huh an Australia
Australian :D
Vic or NSW?
Anyone check out the Trotmania?
Niether :P
NT?
Cane toad all the way.
Loopy_Legend: there's other australians here :)
I know.
0,5Luna Eclipsed was alriight, but it flow like i thought it would
Amazing, an Australia who isn't from Vic or NSW.
Australian, I dunno how to spell tonight.
Vivix I blame you.
I liked Luna Ecplised, but it is one I rarely rewatch-
/me strokes Jmo's tongue
wat.
noow you'll type better
BaconMane i like how that segment in daringn doo was in real time as well
I definitely connected with Luna. I think they played her character great.
0,5I just feel like it was a sudden wierd thing
Dang SuperBrony asleep, great just when I need him.
brb, gotta go shopping
In Luna Eclipsed, I didn't quite like how--she had to change to be liked? Had to tone down her authority
I hate luna(not a lot but you know a little) Because she never comes in the show a lot except for the halloween one
but only so much you can do in 22 minutes
And he was the one chasing me, suppose different time zones a real killer.
But there was that big gap in backstory between Princess Luna breaking out of Nightmare Moon and... you know, "hello where have you been"
We probably will never know a lot about hte prinesses
but- that can be kinda nice
BaconMane: so far I don't really dislike any pony episodes. The two I like the least are just boring
I don't downright dislike any episodes, but there are ones I skip when rewatching
Vivix: I am kinda hoping they would add more lore in S3
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5698/
I love the lore episodes
lol MadSurge. Well of course your worst episodes are going to be boring
Hearth's warming eve is actually one of my top 10 in s2 I think
Well since I'm done eating I'm streaming(all my streams will never be watched because know one would know my livestream and ever see it)
flutter_spin: yes, but I don't go "OMG WORST EPSIOD EVAARRRR :[ "
Lol
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5492/

Bronysith: go search for spiderjack too
THAT TWILIGHT IS A SPY!
Crab
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5008/
shut up The_Engineer
MadSurge: speaking of which, why was the mysterious mare do well so hated by many? Its like it was so obviously bad. did i miss something?
Nou
I still can't believe a Vinyl Fluttershy is coming out. Instant buy for me.
It wasn't hated, it was just--nothing happened in that episode
A vinyl fluttershy
and RD was a bit more of a bitch than usual
The heck?
Soap.
Bitcherdash
The_Engineer: you know the vinyl Rainbow Dash & Derpy?
I liked the episode, but I understood what they ment in the after-episode review
/me eats soap
What O.o
Alchemist: because everyone was out of character apparently
I don't think they were
but it was -- some people hate it, other love it
me neither, maybe RD's character was a bit exaggerated but thats it.
I think the people said 8/10 after initial air
http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/PopCulture/MyLittlePony//My+Little+Pony+Rainbow+Dash+Vinyl+Figure-144781.jsp
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352042470015.jpg
Yeah, a bit exaggerated RD, but--we got to learn about her
but yeah it is a kind of empty episode, so not everyone liked it
Alchemist: it WAS driven by gags, mostly, but I didn't think it was that bad! Also, Batman music and Darkwing Duck hat :$
Rdash vinyl?
yep
What...
yeah, they eh
it was packed with references
I don't get it it kinda looks like the norm one
it was more like a comedy episode than an mlp episode, so I guess that plays in too
LET THE INTERNET BEGIN!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krMLDrXe32c
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/10/toy-review-vinyl-rainbow-dash-and-derpy.html
HAMSTER DANCE
Vivix: My least fav s2 episode was the Flim Flam one :I one song is not enough to drive an episode
OH MY GOD
The vinyl is a LOT BIGGER than I anticipated
Really? I really liked that one- even if I think Flim and Flam was a bit unfairly treated, but they WERE conning-
lol FlimFlam song... so. freakin'. long.
I looved that song though-
Dont get it
Dragon Quest is probably my least in s2-
proobably
Vivix: I just remember the chat at about the 4min marker. "LONGEST SONG EVER"
Hehe yeah, it was LONG
and suddenly, ads
I gotta' go.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2689/
We were like "Wait, that's half the episode!"
flim flam is glorious for the talent of the singer
SERIOUSLY
Flim flam song is HARD to sing
They were grreaat singers
It was ONE singer? O_o
it has a really good showtune feel to it
Gold_Demona, it was two
but still
Vivix: don't blame you. I did like though they brought up the issue of Spike's origins, maybe we can expect more about that this season :3
Yeah, I like that angle of it
I love the Flim Flam song. It's one of my favorites
Bronysith you're just posting pics....Are you gonna talk here or put in random pics at random moments?
but I didn't like the teenage-dragons- I thought it was a bit too outlandish
test
The_Engineer: and you're an asshole ^_^
but- I enjoyed watching it the first time, but I do tend to skip it
The_Engineer, that's his job
Drunk FlimFlam singer > all
How am I a asshole?
Bronysith you're usually the only asshole here at this hour
Gold_Demona: the song is fine, it's the rest of the episode that is kinda eeeehhh
I have one but ain't one
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2234/
Bronysith, you're starting to be one
eh i guess it helped with world buliding Vivix
yeah-
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2224/
but yeah The_Engineer Bronysith does that most of the time
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2118/
MadSurge: That's kinda how I feel about the one with Cranky Doodle Donkey. I LOVE the smile song, but the rest of the episode I can do without.
Now hes just repeatedly attempting to spam?
is stream on
No stream.
Gold_Demona: :D
As much as I love Pinkie, she was just WAY too clueless in that episode.
I know
Cranky Doodle-
Those were the break up episodes
Yeah I get what you mean about that one
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1860/
Or something related to that
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1862/
I love Pinkie Pie, so --she was a bit too blank there yeah- that song was great
Gold_Demona: let's hope for a Pinkie episode that blows them all out of the water :$
MadSurge: Indeed. :3
Aw heall yeah
I'd like a Pinkie-centered episode where she's not a complete bimbo.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1651/
Gold_Demona: at least we got the Smile song :$
Hehe Gold_Demona me too
MadSurge: Pinkie blow who out of the water?
I think she was good in Baby Cakes
^
MadSurge: How true that is
in MMMystery I liked how she got annoyed, and not just super happy all the time
Yea that ep was awesome
Then poor pinkie....cryed...:'(
yeah that and
when Twilight took her hat?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1324/
Vivix: yeah, annoyed Pinkie is still funny :D
she was like >:( for an instant
it was nice to see her have emotions and reactions like that
Yeaah she was fun in that

Gendoshy?
Vivix: I don't
Gold_Demona: gendoshy ftw
I do, but I'm biased
Vivix: yes, you are
I'm 100% biased, but I know limits.
It's called Common Courtesy
Gold_Demona: who is your fav character in NGE anyways? i kind of have a current obsession with that overrated anime :D
:O
As you all notice, right now when I am serious. I am actually using the best grammar I can muster for getting my point across.
A good hint of this going too far. =P
Bronysith: I think either Asuka, Misato, or Penpen
Depending on my mood
Gold_Demona: the friggin penguin?
Bronysith: Penpen is best eva pilot. >.>
Gold_Demona: FUND IT
I thought Common Courtesy was for driving
/me facepalms to StinkomanFan
We have to be courteous in here too
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2091/
And it meant that you give them the finger whenever you can
Vivix: we do?
Everyone fails sometimes, but jeez
Ofcourse we do
Gold_Demona: great, now i have ot search for a pic of PenPen piloting an EVA

Too many too fast withou context

Bronysith: Ok, thats creepy as hell...
...You have your opinion and I have my own :)
Gold_Demona: what anime besides NGE is retardedly overrated that you would say?
StinkomanFan: Digimon has... creatures of poop
So I guess that opinion is more then valid =P
Bronysith: I can't really think of one off the top of my head. =/
I am not going to deny that because it is technically true
Anyway, Duff StinkomanFan . Don't feck around with internet :P
Gold_Demona: how about naruto

Bronysith: It is annoyingly popular though.
Gold_Demona: yeah
StinkomanFan: I don't know Jackson
Gold_Demona: i have a friend who loves anime and he says it has the worst fanbase ever
Naruto had some hilarious tween-shots though

http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4627/ fanfiction in a nutshell
Rainboom: :3
Hi Rainboom
lol
StinkomanFan: Started* "is" you mean =P
;dello sugarpony875
Bronysith: by kissed, you mean fucked, right
Bronysith: :D
cowvarkian: yup
:S
:D brillient
lol
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/864/
one word and I spelt it wrong -_-
:D
my god that was an excellent pot of tea
I understand Vordox that A. I have a papertrail miles long and B. Anypony who hates me can use it to troll me
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5107/
And that is nothing new for anyone anywhere
StinkomanFan: And that's not power?
NewSuperBronyU|Zzz get up
But the thing is, everypony who hates me are either to stupid or too lazy to actually use it against me
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7799/
JRP2234: dont ping SB when hes catching the Z's
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3850/
StinkomanFan: I'm not one of those. :P
StinkomanFan: But to be honest...
StinkomanFan: You've done ALOT of works on wikis, that's something I can admire. XD
But you don't hate me :)
Thank you Vordox
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4772/
StinkomanFan: I don't hate you, I'm just trying to make you a point
Even if I do not know you, well outside of this, doesn't mean I have no power over you
It just requires competance. :P
Vordox: words are power
Power is what value you give to something
Bronysith: thats one hell of a derail :D
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5548/
Bronysith: Wrong, actions are.
Words are empty shells, if anything
Vordox: still doesnt mean they cant hurt
Competence is just like common sense. An ability so rare it may as well be a superpower
Words instigate action, depending on the value you give to either, either can be power
dumb computer
StinkomanFan: XD and well, I can dig even deeper for you, going to take some time though :P
Vivix: So President is power? X
Vivix: Say these words, do something other.
/me shrugs
Actions, to me personally, > Words by any means
to you personally, yes
that's what I'm saying, power is something you assign to something
You'd be amazed how far a well-used word can go.
Or even a not-so-well-used one
there's ACTUAL power, actions are actual power, but that power can be set by words
^
You have made your point Vordox. I shall wait for your mailed picture of a pony mocking me in a few weeks
technically speaking the use of words is an action in itself
StinkomanFan: I'll keep that in mind ;)
chrome drives your ram up your ass if you leave it running with to many tabs open for a while
So, yeah- internet is powerful, and as we've seen with some poor authors of pony-smut, it can make their professional lives hell if they're not careful
Make sure it's a colored envelope so my parents aren't suspicious :)
double rainboom all the way
across the skkkyy
you forgot sonic
inb4 Sonic Hate
sonic rainboom all the way across the skkyy
yea yea yeaaa so intense

If anoyne ever sees a tripple rainbow

I saw a triple rainbow b4
Did your heart melt? D=
Yeah and then I had to get a new one at the hospital :D

/me is now 20% cooler
/me why did the chicken cross the road?
/me is getting VERY close to where StinkomanFan's home is, takes out a envelope.
/me to get hit by a car because it hated itself ; - ;
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/348/
/me because one day it had a dream, an inspiration, a passion to cross this road and see the other side. The chicken had just begun to cross when it his him... the car that is... wow this sucks :D
*hit
sup guys
Hi RDash5000 :)

http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7772/
What's up?
Anyone find Fluttershy to be creepy?
me
those giant eye...
eyes*
Sometimes, it's just a matter of what you read and see. From what I've seen a read, though, I would probably run away screaming like a little girl.
I find Pinkie Pie to be creepy
sometimes
The Fiction That Shalt Not Be Named made sure of that for me.
cupcakes?
sam?
SHHHHH!
my little dashie?
My favortie pony is either Applebloom, Applejack or Fluttershy.
You don't want to say it here. It's dangerous.
ok i wont say my little dashie
We all know Twilight is best pony
Luna is favorite and best pony.
STOP MISSPELLING PINKIE
rainbow dash is best pony
Twilight is best pony -3-
Strange way to spell Twilight guys
4chan defiled the name of Rainbow Dash.
RD is worst pony
Derpy_Hooves: /)
Pinkie is creepy and sometimes annoying, Rarity is full of herself and Rainbow Dash is even more full of herself
DerpyMuffins: fluttershy isn't creepy silly :) http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7542/
Tab fail
138
lol ik
hi
APPLEBLOOM111: exactly
Hi everyone!
DerpyMuffins: /)
APPLEBLOOM111: but i have to disagree with rarity and pinkie
(\
Hi JFFS :)
Twily is best pony
APPLEBLOOM111: pinkie just wants to make everyone smile and almost everything rarity does is for helping someone
Rarity helps her friends so she can help herself
Pinkie is not so much creepy but I still find her annoying SOMETIMES.
Best Villian: Discord Best CMC: Sweetie Belle Best Princess: Luna Best mane6: Twilight Best bg pony: Derpy Best colt: Doctor Whooves
Rarity is a drama queen, Rainbow Dash is a hard head, Twilight has PSD, Applejack is Applejack, Fluttershy is too cute(not even sure if possible), and Pinkie has ADD, ADHD, and eats too much sugar.
discord is best CMC?
no lol
You're welcome.
imo applejack is best background pony
http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/250x250/10816572.jpg

Yes, indeed.
http://blog.lesemajeste.org/.a/6a00e55195c7d28834011168458fd3970c-800wi Sequal to the popular "On the Internet Nobody Knows You are a Dog"
AJ needs moar love
^
AJ hasnt even had a song yet
^
Twilight has like 8
Applejack sang in Winter Wrap Up. There is no excuse.
but its not HER song
^
True, but she still sang.
background ponies cant have songs
Derpy got a song
way
wat?
she did?
Well fanmade ones
According to the Pony Participation Proclamation, ponies who sing in songs have their own song.
Derpy has more fanmade songs than AJ does
When Applejack finally got a S2 episode, Derpy stole the show. I don't not like derpy I'm just saying
Derp face, derp face I love you...
everypony sang in winter wrap up
ur face is a skew
I can't remember the rest LD
Even when AJ got her own episode, Derpy stole the thunder
:D
Derpy?
OH you mean Ditzy Doo
derp face derp face I love you your eyes are all googly and your face is a skew!
That episode was mainly the other m6, so not just derpy
Derpytroll
I call her Derpy Ditzo Doo Hooves
That's not how you spell Derpy.
Askew.
CrimsonPhoenix: both names are fine to me :)
ditzy....
nah
Is the endless stream buffering happening to everyone?
i'll stay with derpy
I fine with both
Cung Foo
JFFS: we are watching the buffer show
JFFS: everyone
Stupid parents
MadSurge, my headcanon name is Ditzy Derpy Doo Hooves the third
the third lol
because heck yeah royalty
I want more party cannon in s3
She's the queen of the muffin kingdom
Hey anyone know some good dubstep, my librarys sort of dry at the moment
terrific
I want more Gilda and Trixie in S3
BraveLittlePyro, none
CrimsonPhoenix: :D I pretend her formal name is Ditzy Doo but friends call her Derpy Hooves :D
well that was easy
BraveLittlePyro: i dont think that exists
My headcanon is that Derpy Hooves had been sent to Equestria from the Moon to loosen the ponies up for an invasion by breaking their windows and eating all of their muffins.
Trixie has been confirmed in S3
:\
BraveLittlePyro: Ultimate Sweetie Belle :O
Hm, k.
needs more luna tbh :)
Or Breaking a Sweat by Skrillex
Headcanon: Secretly, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon have crushes on eachother.
have thaty
I cannot wait until the next season. The new villain looks suckish, though.
Trixie needs to be Luna's protege
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5683/
screw the solar empire
Bacon[Hazard], no season 3 discussion
lunar republic FTW
i really hope scootaloo gets an episode
Oh okay.
Is it bad that I once found Silver Spoon sexually attractive?
When someone says CHICKEN what is the first thing you think of??
Rainboom: Looking for songs like Sick Bubblegum if that narrows it down any more
Rainboom: KFC
Rainboom, fried chicken
APPLEBLOOM111: nah same here
Silver Spoon is cute, it's--how she is
also guys
I am hancorin' fer sum Kentucky Fried Scootaloo.
Diamond Tiara is best villain
KFS
EFS
scootaloo needs character developement!
Equestria
fry
I love Diamond and Silver on the villain poster
Scootaloo
EFS
Equestian Fried Scootaloo.
Equestrian Fried Scootaloo
"We're totally like villains"
Genius!
CrimsonPhoenix: Discord is now displeased with you
EFS
BraveLittlePyro, Discord is in Statue
CrimsonPhoenix: Expect some chocolate rain in the near future
Flim Flam Brothers are beat villians
Diamond Tiara is still alive and still torment the CMC
best*
CrimsonPhoenix: And Discord IS BEST STATUE
Guys
Trixie is best cereal
me+ponies=http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5630/
BraveLittlePyro, yeah and he can't do anything
If any mods werent afk, they would silence us
brb, chat derped
Diamond Tiara attacks with 'Blank Flank!'. It isn't very affective...
No S3 discussions
while Diamond Tiara still manage to be an obstacle
Rainboom: :D
CrimsonPhoenix: No comment
Oh gawd http://i.imgur.com/WPtcH.png
DAYUM
HOMOSEXUALITY IS CANON

cachi01: WAR IS CANON

oh my niock is changed
sup konsoln
hi konsoln
Looks like Diamond has an admirer now
99.99% of Equestria is female
thats better, hi everyone xD
hey konsoln
Love notes are canon. Notes are canon. Love is canon. Homosexuality is canon. Lesbians are canon.
Hi Lil_B :)
Hai Lil_B
There's also some people who think that the sad pony down in right corner was trying to give her card to Twist
everyone at that age gives everyone valentines
TwistxTruffle Shuffle?
No!
^
Not in thi scountry, we don't give them at all
and thanks RDash5000 cachi01 JFFS thelonepony and DerpyMuffins :D
inb4 Equestria bans gay marriage. inb4 ponies do it anyway. inb4 half of the population is on the moon.
well when I was in elementary school we pretty much gave the whole class valentine cards
oh, sorry Lil_B. Hi!
Seems legit.
08,01how is homosexuality canon?
i find the valentine thing stupid
Not me :'(
You obviously did not see the picture.
08,01the picture?
Someone repost it.
I am too lazy.
hugs http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5630/
ok, I logged in via an other IRC because it said for me that Bronystate was down :/ ok changing back now
not that one
and we're talking about this picture http://i.imgur.com/WPtcH.png
Stallions in Equestria are rare to say the least
Most of them are the royal guard
stallions are like 20% of equestria
More like 5%
Considering the ratio of female to male, I still don't see how there would still be homosexual males running around.
inb4 ten on one.
DerpyMuffins, I'm sorry but that's not true
5% male ratio
nope
5% is impossible
More like 15%.
10% the most
20% is appropriate
Because most of them are most likely living in the other cities.
Do you like me? yes definetly ABSOLUTLY
I pick neither.
I'd say 35 % male because many oif the BG Ponys are male
Gravity Falls?
:3
40%
Most stallions are Celestia's royal guard
I RIGGED IT
there's no shortage of stallions or mares
i hear faint noises in my headphones... i'm scared
and I'll go with Vivix
35% the most
Where is your Celestia now?
just smile and wave boys. smile and wave http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7849/
Vivix there's never not a shortage of mares
/me brain break
inb4 a new episode comes up with most of the stallions are in cryogenic storage.
cachi01: :D
look at how many stallions in guard, in Canterlot, in s2 backdrops for ponyville
bye guys :)
Back
inb4 Bacon[Hazard] got it right and he is banned for spoilers
Inb4 another unknown relative is reveled
That actually makes a lot of sense... make this fiction. NOW.
*fan fiction*
/me goes back to reading shipping
/me goes back to reading creepypasta
/me always thought pasta was creepy
DerpyMuffins of course, the evil tin of cadence, ! which was frozen... in time... because...
/me thinks it looks like food, tastes like water
/me goes back to... stuff >_>
twin*
chat derped
Headcanon: Big MAc is secretly a superhero
/me thinks that pasta wants to kill him while he is asleep
do we have a stream
no
I do not think so
Inb4 Discord was Celestia's ex
Headcanon, BigMac is happy and alone.
WHEN WILL BACKGROUND PONY UPDATE
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH
Celestia stoned him because he dumped her
Actually my only gay headcanons, as in not for fun and shipping and fics, is Pokey, Cheerilee and Lyra/BonBon
DerpyMuffins: inb4 that was already made fan canon in a few places
It's quite an old fanon
Lyra/BonBon confirmed in S3?
CrimsonPhoenix I hoipe they'll include a Manticore soon, would spare me some work :/
Coldn't say if I knew
Lil_B, wat
what Manticore?
Pretty sure Lyra/BonBon was confirmed in S2
confirmed as close friends yeah
CrimsonPhoenix the one from S1 E2 ?
"___ __" Pinkie said.
Inb4 Cadence was married before
but I like to think they're a couple
Guess what she said.
Lil_B, what about him?
also guys about Lyra Bon bon http://www.fimfiction.net/story/26061/4/How-Every-Shipfic-Would-Actually-Happen/LyraBon
CrimsonPhoenix I hope they will include it in the next Backgroundpony update so I don't have to make one
Applejack?
'realistic view'
and comedy
by they you mean he?
yeah won't read
I really wish they made DiscordXCelestia canon
and no please
clopfics REALLY scare me...
DerpyMuffins: no
just
no
why would he put a manticore when Luna is coming to town
I certainly don't want Discord Celestia, but if it happens it happens
Why else would Celestia stone him?
APPLEBLOOM111: clopfics are fun
Because he enslaved ponies for generations?
Watch S1 pilot and various other lore episodes
Part of me wishes they would make a new series as a parody of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic on Adultswim.
I don't like parodies, but I'm sure that would be a hit
I could say something harmless about Clopficts but I think its better to not talk about this Stuff altogether here in the chat
Bacon[Hazard]: well MAD already made some cool parodies
and there is this R34 parody on the works.......
I read a clopfic of a human having sex with the CMC, a human having sex with Twilight, and one were Soarin fucked a pie.
They sucked. I mean big time, multi episode parodies.
APPLEBLOOM111: XDD equestrian pie is hilarious
...
yea that;s it
"That's one big ass pie!"
^
I've been warned for less so yeah
drop it
Headcanon: Mr and Mrs Cake are the only ponies in Ponyville to have had sex in a long time
ok
]
You know what they say opposite attract
I guess that episode made sex canon...
>implying that the ponies ever had sex in the first place and are not all offspring of Celestia.

StinkomanFan: then explain THIS http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N1ji-9xoZtM/UCGB8VIjHqI/AAAAAAAAE8o/hRB01t7KCvQ/s1600/69170__.jpg

This is what the babies look like http://iambrony.steeph.tp-radio.de/mlp/gif/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-baby-mane-six.gif?1323979436 not that
Oh my Celestia, it's NewSuperBronyU.
SB, how was EQLA?
/me hugs NewSuperBronyU !
APPLEBLOOM111: well say that to hasbro!
CrimsonPhoenix, that it has, but it still may or may not related to s3, I honestly don't know and have avoided looking at it because of it
APPLEBLOOM111: Diabetes.
I have tzo check the Mikrowave, I just warmed up an old Meme
Vivix, I personally don't think it will
I hope not-
Headcanon: the CMC are members of the Kids Next Door
Even if foals are cute, I hope not
StinkomanFan: lol
there's been tons of custom original ponies in there
ahhh... the smell of all the base
Hasbro doesn't give a flying feather about their toys!
APPLEBLOOM111, HA HAHAHAHAHA yeah no
Toys are all that Hasbro care about
Hasbro is a money making giant similar to Activision.
well its true CrimsonPhoenix
their toys suck
they care about their toys more than the shows
Hasbro are fine, their CEO's are nice people
APPLEBLOOM111: of course they do. there's money coming from selling them after all
he only good mlp toys were the mcdonalds ones
but Hub is nicer
and the blindbags
"I LOVE MAKING NEW FRIENDS!"
the*
NewSuperBronyU
Hasbro has a deal with Zynga now, Hasbro sells now Board games of Social Games
What's wrong with brushables
The mcdonalds ones look more accurate. Except the cutie marks
Zynga sucks.
theres a Farmville board game?
WTF
OH NOES I HAVE TO MAKE THE HAIR MYSELF
wah huh?
HASBRO
STAHP
cachi01 and a words with friends board game
really?
hasbro
Headcanon: Hasbro is a realy company in Equestria and sells toys based on Humans
but..that already exists!
it it looks like Hasbro is ressurecting Furbys
hasbro stahp
/me hugs Lil_B back :D
11,02DashWithRainbows: It cool :D
aww :3
Do you know what I did when I found out that Hasbro made MLP? I nearly psised myself when their logo popped up.
*pissed*
Lil_B: after all this years of peace.....they strike again......the horror has returned...
Lil_B, they did indeed, one or two months ago
CrimsonPhoenix what happened
CrimsonPhoenix I was searching for something MLP releated on theirt siate and it was on the frontpage -.-
inb4 they make a spin off of the Tellitubbies.
hey, i found you NewSuperBronyU
Shouldnt you be at a con NewSuperBronyU
Bacon[Hazard]: I would love that
>Furbies
/me tags NewSuperBronyU
OH GOD WHY
Lil_B, well yeah they WILL advertise what's new
Hey guys
/me tackle glomps AttackWithHugs
Furbies are worse than gremlins
Fluffy~ :3
Why Furbies? Why not the Rubix Cube?
AttackWithHugs: Hai gurl, wutchu doin?
/me hugs Jmo
cachi01 I remember back in the very early 2000, damn... everyoner needed them... for some reason
Hasbro wants to make less episodes just because they think kids don't mind reruns. And they said that they want to make less episodess so they don't have to pay as much or something like that.
Because everybody already has one.
HoodyNinja, I doin' fine. Just gettin' home from church

He then wandered into the back of the convention and saw a pony all alone. This

My history teacher used to be in a hair metal band in the 80s and one day he...
Oh wait
08,01go on
Didn't expect that, thanks guys
My history teacher used to be in a hair metal band in the 80s and one night he and the other people in the band went around clubbing
They were at one club and one guy in the band came up and said, "Hey guys there's this wooden leg with a Nike shoe in it. It's so good, I'm gonna take it." So he takes the shoe and leg under his coat and they leave. Some time later...
Some time later they were at a different club (Been a while since I heard the story so I can't remember the names of these places) and someone else they knew came up to them. He was at the club they were at earlier. He told them that the police were all over the club they were just at, turing the whole place inside out. They asked why and he said "The DJ was a Vitenam vet and someone stole his prosthetic leg!"
08,01not sure if end of story >.>
08,01imma go for yes
MAGIC APPLE OF CAKE NewSuperBronyU NewSuperBronyU NewSuperBronyU is a potato NewSuperBronyU is a apple NewSuperBronyU is a carrot NewSuperBronyU is a cat NewSuperBronyU likes cheese

Ahaa
So, you want to hear a story eh?
est teacher ever
Hehehehe
oh look stream
08,01oh, there's more?
08,01go ahead
So they went down to the club where they took the leg and sure enough the cops were searching all over the place.
05can i lick your beard?
08,01sure
/me licks
13http://i.imgur.com/VekEY.jpg
Oh snap
That's pretty hardcore
They didn't want to just walk in, so they went over to some guy passing by on the street and gave him the leg and said "Hey could you bring that in to that club?" So the guy takes the leg and goes into the club. My teacher and the band goes into a parking lot across from the club and watches what happens. The fellow they gave the leg to goes into the club, then quickly runs out with the cops chasing him.
My teacher felt dirty and told me "I'm going to hell for that."
Okay now I'm done
I'll tell you a story you might not believe, but I tell you it is true
08,01this is #bronystate hard mode

Everlasting_Joy: http://i.imgur.com/5g3hz.jpg
cachi01: try listening to abba which is on the vevo channel with bieber and minaj faces on the sides of the video
http://mlfw.info/f/8250/
best song in the game starts and you die :/
twilight_sprinkle: .-.
thx god no shitty artists appear while listening to the scorpions
twilight_sprinkle: i dont understand why ppl hate vevo? it has most of there favourite bands songs in each account
accualy im hearing scorpions on their vevo channel xd
/me wonders what song is hearing cachi01
Michael: wind of change
cachi01: nice choice!
:3
its one of my fave scorpions song
weird
I pirated this game, and I've been wanting to buy it normally. Full price only, though
how is it?
It's worth paying for.
/me is hearing bridge over troubled water
superretroworld: well for example what i mentioned, trying to watch an abba video with bieber and minaj on the sides of the video
i dont like abba but anyway... they are like one of the biggest bands of the 60's and they place bieber and minaj on the recommended.
dafuq
superretroworld: they try too hard with publicity
cachi01: They place those two on nearly everything.
http://i.imgur.com/svNm1.jpg
good afternoon everypony ^_^
twilight_sprinkle: thats only one complaint i have, but you think by now they'll do something about it
hey BladedWings.
Michael: celestia: soon
afterniin BladedWings
Howdy BladedWings!
afternoon BladedWings
hi BladedWings :)
how've you been BladedWings
What is Twilight doing Michael?
Hai BladedWings :)
superretroworld: i doubt it, its kind of what they do, theyre not composers, their job is to advertise
Blocking is so important in this game
hoi BladedWings
DerpyMuffins: playing?
alexxm|foal: not bad ^_^
so is this guy trapped in an alternate dimension or something?
/me hugs Michael Deacon Everlasting_Joy superretroworld cachi01 alexxm|foal MLP_Brovakiin and twilight_sprinkle

/me hugs BladedWings back :3

/me hugs BladedWings back :).
FUCK YOU TO FUCKING HELL
/me hugs BladedWings for the kindness :D
>IRON MAIDEN
Deacon now he needs to find pieces for the "Bastion" so everything can be rebuilt
>ONE DIRECTION ON RECOMMENDED
Meanwhile: http://i.imgur.com/n4J59.jpg see toldya ya make more then one face =P
WTF
ekips gotcha
cachi01: thats what you get for being a 9gagger
lol
Oh SpeccyRush, I'd ask how you managed to get hold of that but I have my suspicions already.
whats the point of cooking something if you can't cook it
c'mon, it's vevo, they're known to be evil
i mean eat
who is streaming btw?
Bronysith: cant understand the hate for 9gag
ekips: Nittany_Discord is
thanks MLP_Brovakiin
cachi01: cause you're a 9gagger
Bronysith: well as long as it makes me laugh
Meanwhile: you link it, or some one else does and I save it for future use
cachi01 it, like instagram and reddit, are hated because of the community there, but I doubt you're anything like that
Well, he has to find energy cores to power the Bastion. That allows it to build itself.
Deacon: yeah most people on 9gag are douches
^
Meanwhile: just like this one http://tinychat.com/ss63/9f4722/b0/baconmane/go258/10-26-2012
4chan is just filled with crazy people
reddit. well reddit is fine
But he seems to be in the 2nd half of the game where he's hunting for shards, which are less powerful than cores.
4chan is best site
cachi01: mostly on /b
SpeccyRush: There is nothing that can bring context to that image.
/h/ ftw xd
everywhere else, they're level headed....well except for /v/
Meanwhile: except when neil says DON'T LOOK AT THAT IMAGE, THAT IS NOT ME
Deacon, /v/ is /b/2.0
SpeccyRush: It totally is him. And that totally is his hair.
Meanwhile: 'swhy I saved it, to mess with him
I need an overly poetic narrator for my daily life
Btw, if you like the soundtrack of this game. It's on Bandcamp
Oh, did he do Jawson Bog yet?
http://oi47.tinypic.com/1j6hpf.jpg i dont want to live on this planet anymore
Winter Wrap-up is oficially the best song
comfirmed by hte writers in the panel
cachi01: What?
CrimsonPhoenix: That's a funny way of spelling "Smile Smile Smile".
^
CrimsonPhoenix: i prefer smile :(
ft. nicki minaj? oh boy
i know...
ekips got it when it was on the Humble Bundle :)
Lil_B: I don't have Paypal, so I got it on Steam^^

/me sets Chrysalis on fire

/me is inflammable
ohey Chrysalis !
Lil_B dunno, I'm using Paysafecards

Michael: As if I wasn't cold enough.
/me hands out towels
ekips me nether, I use a Credit card only for Internet Payments

why did I stopped playing this game?
cause dungeon crawlers are usually boring
/me makes a bonfire
Bronysith, for you they might be
eveb Diable II Bronysith?
*Diablo
Deacon: especially diablo 2
but PSO did dungeon crawling right
D2 is best diablo ever!

http://i.imgur.com/dtFMG.jpg the feels...
Bronysith: aw shit got real
Michael: and now u die
indeed Michael ;~;
Bronysith: :'(
Vordox: that does not explain why you said that, I find it a bit insulting and wish to know if you have at least a little reasoning behind your accusations.
No feels here Michael
DoctoDoctorWho: I always have a reason of everything I say
Never liked Fluttershy in the first place
Why else would I write? O.o
I don't, and it's funnier that way
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352060472571.png
How can you not like 'Shy? :O
i can
My reasoning is, you're being spoiled on what you get based on previous adaptions of creativities from he former people that worked on those shows
I just dont like Fluttershy
Bronysith: your dream, admit it :D
Therefore, you expect more then you would get based on previous incantations
i dont hate her, just think shes overrated
BUT LO AND BEHOLD
Vordox you look damn much like a Guy I went to school with once ... this white button-shirt and the lenght of the hair -.-like, exactly, even the goofy smiule in the pic
MadSurge: needs more bedroom eyes tbh
Sexy Twilight http://imageshack.us/a/img201/8523/sexylolz.jpg =P
then explain why you called me "too spoiled" for looking at past events and using that data to predict future ones Vordox.
ha!
Bronysith: too bad, you get Molestia first
Vordox: :D
MadSurge: >implying molestia doesnt have bedroom eyes
DoctoDoctorWho: Cause predicting Data on previous years is as exact as looking at Nostrademeus today
Lil_B: Was he a fun guy?
Good morning BronyState :)
Bronysith: no, just "you're gonna get touched" eyes
Hai AdamTheDuck
.-.
hai AdamTheDuck!
Dem stalker eyes Bronysith
Hai AdamTheDuck :)
"you're gonna get touched" eyes lolwut .-.
best eyes ever
Vordox yes, but no, he had a heavy hessian accent, and you are from swedish :P
Ohai AdamTheDuck
[16:13:32] <Lil_B> ohgod, Season 5 announced, will have 3 eps , directed by Tommy Wiseau, writing by Michael Bay <-- FUND IT
AdamTheDuck: Bronysith can't accept Molestia has no bedroom eyes

Vordox, oh God what? XD

O U SEGA
Vordox: still doesnt justify calling me spoiled
LMAO XD
DoctoDoctorWho: Really?
Then I have no further reasons to give you?
http://i.imgur.com/l35BJ.jpg
Vordox was that a real sega advert
Vordox: If I made an incorrect prediction, then that makes me wrong. I dont know how it makes me spoiled.

Vordox: Your logic then begins to work against you. If you think that I will sad/rage because I was wrong about there being 6 seasons, then I dont get mad over it and prove you wrong thus making you spoiled by your own logical argument.
I don't expect anything really.
So how can I be..spoiled by any means of that word?
can we watch something now pls?
wait.....only 6 seasons?
oh...
:(
cachi01: DoctoDoctorWho expects there'll be 6 seasons
Based on previous works of Lauren
Already linked, but aaaaaaaaaa <3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVxhK3Hvhig
(Who is not working anymore on MLP)
even if there were to be 6 seasons doesn't mean they will be good
Vordox: oh yeah. ppg and foster only had seasons
6*
MadSurge, d'aaw ^^
may I remind you that those seasons had less than 20 episodes
I still say that S5 needs Tommy Wiseau and Michael Bay, maybe Uwe Boll for the Finale
The flaw in Vordox's argument here, is that he did not differentiate between "expecting" and "hopefull predictions"
I want them to stop when they run out of ideas, so FiM doesn't turn on Spongebob
DoctoDoctorWho: Really?
^
O_o
Ohai Chrysalis :)
hey
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: If I made an incorrect prediction, then that makes me wrong. I dont know how it makes me spoiled.
Hai Chrysalis
So Apparently, this weekend I will be able to see the premiere of new pony!
Predictions based on work where Lauren was in staff at most of the times
Compared to MLP where she left after first.
Which is a YAY in my book!
Just came back from seeing Wrek-it-Ralph!
MadSurge, i guess when they run out of ideas they are going to ask the bronies ^^
Those flaws alone make your prediction more of expectations =P
EY everypony
hi Robotdragon9
Invi: not the smut ideas I hope :D
ohai Robotdragon9
Good thing we don't live in the 80's or 90's anymore, the chances of getting a Life Actian Adaptation are about 0 (except for the last Airbender)...
Hello Robotdragon9

MadSurge, ditto ^^ i guess they'd do a contest ^^
currently playing through Area 51 for ps2
i forgot how much i hate the morning bronystate crowd
Robotdragon9: is that game good?
MadSurge "Giving the Pony Socks?... actually thats Brilliant! More Accosiarys to be sold!"
Women: I like 50 shades of Grey: Men: I like Porn. <--- C wat I did thar? =P
Accossiar... dI don't care
Lil_B: accessories :D
cachi01 my first shooter ever...i liked it, its good.
Vordox: Base point is, Im not expecting them to make 6 seasons, I just took previous data and used that to predict the future. If they dont go that far, Im not gonna rage.
Robotdragon9: oh might give it a try sometime :)
DoctoDoctorWho: Then why did you tell the others then?
MadSurge no, I spelled it just as I intended it... wrong
/me licks Bronysith .-.
cachi01 ok have fun :)
DoctoDoctorWho: If not to raise their expectations, and therefore their consequences of their communication with you, some of them will expect it
AdamTheDuck: how does he taste like?
http://i.imgur.com/dimII.jpg
Therefore, you claim your actions to be for yourself, but you tell it to others, which is...what then exactly?
Bronysith wat
Wow this sound panel is getting interesting
What could happen, is they could end the show, but continue G4 with occasional TV/DVD/Blu-ray hour long specials like they did with G3.
MadSurge, he taste... Like http://derpy.me/LwJ-D

Bronysith, XD
I still hold to my Idea of a MLP Spinnoff show, or revamped version, that appeals more to older audiences (more intense action, different artsyle etc.)
Good afternoon, everyone. How are you all today? :)
Vordox: because when people find something they like, one of two things happen. they either A: take the road of greed and keep it to themselves, or B: They share it and increase their own happiness by enjoying their discovery with others, I believe this was the lesson of episode 3?
i cant see it, my computer wont let me
/me hugs AJIsAwesome

my god this car pile up is awesome
Bye Lil - gone
yes?
ok ive got alotta tabs down
were all these police cars necessary ?
Vordox: And for the record, Im 16. Not like that makes a single difference except that it makes you look bad by falling back on the "we dont agree, therefore you must be young and immature" arguement. This whole thing started because you unneccesaraly insulted me on the basis of a prediction that only time can prove true or false. Thus, Im not really at fault here, not implying that there is somepony to blame to begin with,
omg
DoctoDoctorWho: quit your bitching
u mad?
Dat wall of text
he mad
Bronysith: Please, behave.
Chat derped, what happened?
oni_link: people fussing
DoctoDoctorWho: It's not aboutImmature, it's about experience of the humanrace.
ah
And suddenly my spacebar is not working
Invi: try this one for full screen http://www.justin.tv/everfreemedia#/w/4113281824/2
http://derpy.me/uGFWg
One person gives hopefull prediction, then we had WW2
Need I put it in a bigger scale? =P
Frenchy_pony, okay. that is much better. merci ^^
Or better yet, one person incites hope in a group of people, people don't get it, they do actions, And what happens of those actions?
"For enjoyment of others" I feel is the wrong word no matter how you look at it.
Gnight everypony, HF!
night Michael
Goodnight Michael
Night, Michael.:)
bai Michael
omg this is like the best show ever
http://imgur.com/UrPXk laziness ladies and gentlemen
its like going on and on and on and on and on
bye Michael
This Victor Frost guy is amazing
Vordox: and I made a prediction based on past events, just like people have been doing for thousands of years, Its not so big a deal that you must get mad over it. In fact, the only one I see here getting worked up like you say is you.
pony_3498: you have to realize mods are people too

killerpony7733: sad attempt at trolling XD
What an ass...
^
At tops, unless something happens, it'l be 3 and a half season
Hurrow :3
Hai Wubstep :)
also i dont think the mane six are underagged, i mean they have jobs for the love of god

Not even close to 6 is possible
Ohai Wubstep
hi Wub wub Wubstep :3
wow that was odd
ikr
how are things Wubstep
moving along Bronysith lol
What I am basing it on, is not about the previous work, but the current situation of the work.
Bronysith Nah isn't trolling at all. Trolling is making comedic fun out of a situation and what not
Past is not the same as the new. =P
now*
Hi, Wubstep. :)
What Did I Miss? D:

Wubstep bad trolling
agree?
DoctoDoctorWho: ...
yolo
DoctoDoctorWho: That would be awesome, but we're Hasbro here
DoctoDoctorWho: lol
They had a fit with Derpy...
But my prediction still stands, unless a miracle happens.
3 and a half season, at best.
Blood doesnt need to spill, even death doesnt need to kill anypony, he can just make the land all barren and crap.
How long is a half season?

BladedWings, yeah
flutterchu ur welcome
It's a FUN image no doubt... but damn
Vordox: hope is a type of assumption that everything will turn out for the better, religion is belief in a higher power.

Vordox: zombies
Vordox: Medically speaking you are alive. Technically speaking you are writing, not talking.
since i ate my candy i have a HUGE hole in my permanit jaw and my tounge has a bunch of bumps on it, now it it's whenever i speak or eat
Vordox is getting KINDA annoying
._.
This is just stupid
Either you DO
Or you DON'T
lol
MadSurge: Yay! I shall go find rainbows more often! ^_^
There's no "maybe".
Vordox: "I hope it doesnt rain tomorrow" is not the same as "God is our saviour"
guys
what r u doin?
guys
STAHP
^
I have been afk
You BELIEVE it'll not rain, doesn't mean it's reasoned to a god at all.
It's still a BELIEF.
STAHP
STFU
fucking hell
goddamn fucking internet argument
Vardoss, STAHP
THIS IS GOING NO WHERE
Vordox IS annoying
Wait, I just came back and the topic is 'Gods existance' now?... uhg...
DerpyMuffins: no hes not

What the hell? Why is religion even being dicussed?
Rex_Mundi you and me both

Rex_Mundi: No, it's about "belief"
Nothing to do with God.

Ohai TheGreatAndPowerfulT!
T
well im gonna go now see u guys later.
bye Robotdragon9
Bye Robotdragon9 :)
cya Robotdragon9 :)
Belief is believing in something. That something can be anything, but it's still a belief. ._.
i believe this agument needs to stop
how've you been TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Vordox: stahp!
I believe we should stop this
I believe that this argument is something that needs be taken serious due to that it's within the English Dictionary
lets change topic.....
ohai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
And by not knowing what it is, you show symptons of using the word wrongly.
Vordox: If you believe it wont rain tomorrow, then that is saying you know it wont. If you hope it doesnt rain tomorrow, that is saying you dont know but are well, hoping that it doesnt.
Lets talk about our theories of the ponyverse/Equestrias history, instead.
Is there nothing else of interest to talk about?
SSHHHHHHH
Lets change the Topic pls
How about the weather? What is it like in your area?
GilDash: http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/1435/wtfrzl.jpg Bronies and their R32 can stick it =P
Great another debate
Vordox: just take it to another chat. and lets talk about ponies in this chat or something else
GilDash: guess not
i'm Good alexxm|foal and you ?
i'm good TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Vordox: oh god what xDD
Vordox: :D
Anyone wanna place bets?
Vordox: Why would you have that! :D
I tried to get everypony talking about 40k, but noooooooo!:D
DerpyMuffins: on what?
MLP_Brovakiin: Ask the person driving it
Vordox, Rule 32?
Who keeps something like that Vordox :D
OR what the rule was
34
Anything can be sexified or something
Yeah Rule 34
Its R34
aaaaanyway
If it exists, there's a porn of it, no exceptions.
^
DoctoDoctorWho: You're still implying hope as in belief. ._. same is with thinking then...
We've gone from belief to R34? Is there nothing else to discuss? XD
So....6 more days ^_^
R34.2 is if it exist there is a pony of it
The exception is r35
BladedWings: eeyu[ ^_^
an internet rule that states that if it can be said, it can be said with a picturewhy say "i see what you did there" when you can just as easily scour the interweb for hours trying to find a picture of an owl with a text edit saying the same thing? that's rule 32
eeyup*
It was all fun and games untill you brought in the rules ._.
STFU WITH THE RULES
Great how did this get from religion to rules?
BRING ALL THE RULES
DoctoDoctorWho: Go check up the word Think and Belief =P
/me starts hitting chat with a slipper
Ouch! ;~;
Also, look at Prediction while you are at it
:O
YOU BROKE THE RULES!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NylmdC_uEM

I've just realised I can't tell you the weather from where I am as it's too dark to see.
^
Vordox: You are arguing a lost point. you made an accusation toward me on something you thought I would do, without any foreknowledge of me. My actions do not correspond with your predictions, so drop it already.
GilDash: :D it's England, it's cloudy or raining
GilDash, well you should notice if you see stars or if it is raining ^^
GilDash: you have a 50% chance :D
Fine, go ahead, screw things up =P *Blunt*
MadSurge: :D
MadSurge: As there are no raindrops and I can't see stars I'm goign with "cloudy". XD
HIS NAMES NOT KIRK
Then what IS his name?

MadSurge, that's an ooooooooold game
if it's the one I'm thinkingof
ooooh nvm
it's something entirely different
still sort of old
Man, whoever linked this yesterday, I can't stop listening to it :$ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAGW92wdC00
CrimsonPhoenix: Got it through a humble bundle
Vordox, nope :(
bittin: *pat*
Vordox, but if you are a hot Pegasis i wont say no :)
CrimsonPhoenix: what were you thinking of then?
It's a strange song to start the morning to, but I love it.
Baka-Neku twitrix is a weird way to say Twixie
some flash video
like I said
ENTIRELY different
oh god guys i went outside today
bittin: I'm a guy =P
the graphics were amazing
And stop picking up girls on thechat here. :P
cachi01, outside? Is that some kind of expansion pack?
Vordox, damn =(
iam also a guy
AdamTheDuck: kinda the graphics were amazing but the stroyiline and the gameplay was bullshit
HOLY FUCK
GRAPHIC=/= good game
I have permanantly sworn off having a love life
Outside is amazing
Bronysith: Wrong :P
Bronysith, it was a joke .-.
it's crap because YOU make it crap
CrimsonPhoenix, depends on where
Last big panel a EQLA about to begin shortly, with William Anderson
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: shhhhhhhhh i can't help my keyboard changes keys as it pleases =D
Graphics can be a game
Outside is cool, but it's cold :<
Ever heard of Child of Eden?
ture the system is complicated but you get used to it
mfw i havent played child of eden :8
:(
Take the flame war to 4chan
I want a game where the graphics are 1:1 realism, but have a guy eating a piece of toast for 10 hours
How is that a game?
cachi01: You know of it though?
Deacon: where you are may be cold, but here in wisconson its, *puts on sunglasses* 20% cooler.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuYWLYjOa_0 <-- Child of Eden
I think people estimated in about 10 years, it may be possible to have games that look no different from reality.
well actually, weather's been moody lately, it's been hot and cold
AdamTheDuck, in about 10 years we'll have augmented reality
im back :)
Vordox: of course i know of it
wb cachi01
Invi, we never asked for this? .-.
dang pegasi can't make up their mind
Welcome back cachi01

Vordox: i've been wanting the game since it was released
but idk why i havent bought it..

But hey, hard game is hard
Vordox: yeah single player campaign sucks
cachi01: Tell me about it...

MadSurge, I've never seen Gravity Falls
What is this Gravity Falls thing? Is it a TV show or something?
it's pretty decent, though I only saw about one to two episodes
GilDash: yep, and it's a nice one too
I asked *what* it was, not wether it was any good. -_-
can't say that I recall a time where the guy was the straight man in a cartoon and the girl was the comic relief
Deacon: Talking about Samurai Champloo?
I can't recall it every being the other way around. :S
Or do you talk about Cowboy Bebop Deacon ?
Oh
then again, more like canadian animation
since that's what you'll mostly see
Derpy H:P:Pves
So, what's goin' on?
GilDash: two kids in the eponymous Gravity Falls have run ins with supernatural stuff, in a Billy and Mandy way sorta
MadSurge: Ah, okay. That makes a little more sense.
GilDash: also Rob Renzetti is one of the writers
MadSurge: I've no idea who that is.

BACONM
BACON?

AND MATH?
08,01it's like Erdos Numbers but for non-mathematicians
WHATS THIS SORCERY
Bacon...
08,01how separated you are from Kevin Bacon
Just seen the EE advert then?
speaking of kidnapping http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-3wp2VVhKQ
Somepony please tell me todays not sunday :(

BroPony|MEDIC, Monday for me :P

^
08,01GilDash: actually, i did see that earlier; within the first 2 seconds, i realised what it must be advertising
08,01and what comapny
Sunday... gah, I have to go back to Jobcorp today
AdamTheDuck: Same here :P
08,01i have a Bacon Number of 3
i have to go back to unguarded prison tomorrow
dat sucks
unguarded prison = school
08,01because i've spoken with John de Lancie, and he's got a Bacon Number of 2
What's Bacon Number D:
^
^^ this i must know
So now we've all got Bacon numbers of 4?
08,01CrimsonPhoenix: Kevin Bcaon has a Bacon Number of 0
BroPony|MEDIC: I wish I was still in Highschool. High school is awesome comparied to the real world.
So i have a bacon of 4, damn
SHUT UP AND ENJOY MLPBFDIA http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Z4w3n1AVc
08,01people he knows have a Bacon Number of 1
08,01and so forth

Polydunami: All of us here, yes.
08,01you all have a Bacon Number of 4 now
Rex_Mundi: I've been told
does Hermaeus_Bacon have a bacon number of infinate?
I have no idea what's going on! :D
^
^^
whats a bacon number?
^^^*
08,01i just explained it!
This is hilarious. XD
i want payin attention :P
i'll scroll up
08,01I have had past experience catering weddings, working with making sure the attendees are all satisfied, keeping track of any food or drink that needs replacing, working behind the bar a little, but mainly just doing whatever I can and whatever is asked of me.
08,01
08,01whoops

OH

So who does John De Lancie know to have a Bacon Number of 2?
So we have a bacon number of 4?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7fQjWN7gus
yes
It's how many relations along you are from Kevin Bacon. Those that know him are 1. Those that know them are 2. It goes on.
How the heck do you determine what your Bacon Number is?
all this talk of bacon makes me want bacon
GilDash: AHHH. Thanks. :D

Hello FlutterMEDIC

Hi FluterMEDIC
Hey FlutterMEDIC
Hai FlutterMEDIC

Hi FlutterMEDIC :)
how bout dat shiiiit
Hi Friendchips :)
AJIsAwesome: sounds cool, wish i could go
right now i'm bored out of my fucking mind since i have no idea when Assassin's Creed 3 comes out for PC
Hi thelonepony
*nom nom nom nom nom nom nom*
So here is my idea for an episode, what if season 3 has the Breezies, and Twilight finds Spike underground after pulling a weed. And because of that she is made Princess of ponyville, and then Spike trains Twilight to be a Princess, but then this makes everypony ells nervious. so Twilight decrees that everypony is a princess. The End.
08,01alexxm: yup
FlutterMEDIC: No one knows :O
Here's the link: http://www.everfree.net/eqla/
Rex_Mundi: oh hell no
Oh my gosh, now it's $1000. :D
:P:P:P:D:D:D
dat emote spam
goddamnit
Rex_Mundi: That would be... The best episode ever!!
AJIsAwesome: /)
You're too easily annoyed, Sith. :D
considering its against the rules...
ORIGINAL SKETCH OF DISCORD
^
Rex_Mundi, why not make an alternate universe where they are foals and scootaloo is their age and so is Cherille and they're sisters and the same age and Rainbow dash always dresses in style?
08,01hey FlutterMEDIC
1000 dollars
Bronysith: People spam emotes all the time, but there's no reason to get mad EVERY single time. :D
just..wow
anyway, night
08,01FlutterMEDIC: you mean *real* pony?
what?
Friendchips: I know right, and one of the episodes is called "the princess promenade". and Spike can be posh English.
Wow wish i was there
Friendchips: Dat synopsis. :D
and that could be an episode and all? But it still would be witty and inteligent and have good animation

11,02Uhoh, Twitter limited me again

It's $130 now.
but Nutella shouldn't be on the hipster continent
makes sense that Equestria is its own continent there
Ah, Dusty is auctioning a "Stay Brony My Friends" hoof print emblem.
Have some Brony Nostalgi
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4mIFK148go&feature=g-vrec
It's now going for $140
Where is nerd island? With rpgs and stuff like that?
Why, Sesaon 3 can be rid of all those bad things that bring the series down. Any danger or villainous characters is too unpleasent, and who wants developed characters anyways? No sir, G4 should be like G3 with its tea parties and non-conflicts and simple characters. thats what makes a good show!
Friendchips: Probably somewhere small
these goddamn walls
darn.

AdamTheDuck: :D

OW
sonicdude558, take it easy with the RP.
bad idea
Isnt RP banable?
Hoy there quebec friend
I guess I should be called RPer558
yes
Depends on how far you go with it.
Uh oh. Mips is dead
Only excessive RP.

Ponies47: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uo8JqMzCyuU/T8aY_5xsmbI/AAAAAAAArqk/kPc_mJjW4WM/s1600/2.jpg
so when dwill there be a stream?
And what you "do" when you RP.
i thought excessive rp was against the rules not stuff like /me hugs whoever
Ponies47: hot topic :3
glomping is ok rite?
i guess so
/me Writes "want" all over the place
and creating forcefields, and throwing everypony Twi plushies, and snuggling with my imaginary plushie? Is all those thing A-Ok?
/me runs to a dark corner of the chat
Ponies47: it was more expensive than one shirt from hot topic XD
Yeah, I see those belts at my Hot Topic.

Shizuka: Diamond cutting. :)
I had a friend who's dad was a gem cutter he even gave me some :$
nah just cubic zirconias
only a rock can cut through diamond!
Only Link can defeat Ganon!
00,10they are still filming the how to make a dimond ep, check back in a few eons
or was it only a paper?
13so really, diamonds aren't terribly valuable, the price comes from the huge effort needed to make them pretty
AJIsAwesome: great i'll grab my stuff!
>Show up on my credit card bill
00,10yes Shizuka
cachi01: There is no time, your sword is enough!
are you scared of showing signs about your opinion on a show?
I'd rather have a ruby
13veemi pauses for about a second every five.-.
08,01Shizuka: and artificially inflated prices of the diamond industry
/me 08,01hates the diamond industry with a passion
what's a carat in grams?
pauses for me too
00,10I am seeing that
00,10I blame Phase4
every 9 seconds
DINKLEPHAAAAAAAAAAAAASE
i blame sxypartedner
08,01rubies are actually rarer than diamonds, iirc
What's going on, CrimsonPhoenix?
I'd rather have a potato
08,01and it's gone
sapphires are best
potato > diamond
yay! my favorite gem is rarer than diamonds!
00,02i got ping
08,01RoboGerbil: i'd rather have other interesting stones
or lab grown diamonds
AJIsAwesome, nothing that's worth attention I suppose
i got pong, lets play Phase4 !
08,01or lab-created diamonds
08,01because science.
It's your fault Phase4 :$
00,02Sumica, wait what?
08,01i love lab-created rubies
13i got skittles
science > nature
13your arguments are invalid
Back
skittles > science
08,01dear diary, today i scienced me a diamond
my skittles are spicy
Shizuka: i call your skittles and raise with double stuf oreos
Shizuka: M&Ms are better :P
^
Smarties
00,10acording to string thioory you are at falt Phase4
uh shizuka your stream isn't working
The REAL ones
no skittles

13i'm not streaming
ok
08,01sumi is, i think
Sumica your stream isn't working
00,10trying to
08,01Sumica: your stream's gone buggerup
mah feat hurt
13patience ponies
00,10I stoped it to try a diffrent embed
08,01must... science... more... for the stream!
fine Skittles are better than potatoes. For chewy sweetness but not for versitility
chat derped
00,10MIPS is dead atm, so apparently by assosation so is limeV
08,01skittles in baked potato is actually surpriingly good
Sumica: Oh mai
00,10and vemmi is laging.
ew
00,10this is just funderful
hide yo mips, hide yo limeV
08,01Sumica: livestream?
00,10ew no
/me cant see stream
00,10also cant
lawl
00,10unless I just play games
08,01Vordox: candy it
08,01Vordox: with sugar
but I wanna see Diamonds
08,01lots of sugar
i can't help all i get is a 404 screan
08,01Vordox: more sugar! \o/
But it needs...something else
00,10perhaps limeV is fine
To make Banana good...
13and hay bacon strips
why u break the internets!?
But what...
Shizuka: ...NO
00,10seems fmle is dead
13and hay bacon strips

08,01Sumica: i'm 90% sure iti's limeV
this is reminding me of brown sugar cooked bacon
08,01i can't talk to their server
that's some good stuff right there
00,10yeah, odd how they seem to die when MIPS dose eh?
08,01probably on the same CDN
Tovler: who ever uses cursive nowadays other than signatures?
HEY HEY HEY
RoboGerbil: me
00,10no clue what that is
cachi01: WHAT WHAT WHAT
13content distribution network
RoboGerbil: i've been using cursive since i was 4 years old
RoboGerbil my english teacher makes everyone write cursive
08,01Sumica: content-- yeah, that
13balances load over everywhere
RoboGerbil: even though my handwriting sucks
http://pinkie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw2148-13259607837261.jpg
cachi01: hey guess what, they got this new invention called the comupter.. it writes your documents so everyone can read them
08,01a CDN is like an army of clowns
RoboGerbil: A PC?
00,10they seem a bit too intertwined for it to be that
scary
WHAAT?
AJIsAwesome: RD is stealling the liarjack face :P
00,10like down to both dieing at the same time
ok on the lime v here it says the server wasn't found but i don't know if thats my internet or not
00,10more like same pompany diffrent name
08,01i've been writing in cursive since i was about 8
08,01i still suck at it.
^
same here
^^
*^^^
I write italics because it pisses off my teachers
MLP_Brovakiin, fun fact, that screenshot is before Return of Harmony
i was told all the time i would be using cursive for everything as i grew older
what a load
^
im fine with that
08,01in my previous job, i used to write requisition orders, etc. in crayon
08,01it pissed off my boss no end
Italics is where its at
00,10but it was just all the loading of diffrent confix that killed my fmle
In crayon:D
Italics is diagonaly right?
00,10refresh should be on lime v now
I got stream

Slanted, if I remember.

yay stream!
13moar gems
DIAMONDS
:3 I think Im getting a drunk call - 10 minutes from 9 and the phone just rand 11 times
HOW ITS MADE
My teachers dock me a percentage everytime I write italics
I love this show
00,10and it predicts their death
13lul
08,01is it just me, or does the narrator sound a bit like Cave Johnson?
13nah he's too laid back to be vace
13er
13cave
vace
no doors?
vace
/me 08,01casual racism
13i'm just going to stop thinking... daylight savings screwed my body clock..
last time i got angry i broke my chair and ripped my headphones apart
who slams doors these days
13pff all you scots are drunk anyway
/me 13casual alcoholism

08,01200ths on an inch?
08,01that the fuck kind of measurement is that?
13less than millimeter i believe
132/100"
how it's made paper?
00,10needs more reverb to sound like cave
doors
00,10lets take wood, cut it up and make wood with it
08,01ah, okay
Shizuka: Someone teach Usa already about Metres ffs...
hello everypony *nom nom nom nom nom*
Sumica: :D
ello flutterchu
13Vordox: mehhhhh
13go back in time and do it
this is MURRIKA
we use MURIKAN measurements here
00,10microwaved wood
Er, no difference between
they dont use metric, not for everything at least, in england either
none of that namby pamby european stuff
13we use metric for everything scientific, imperial for temperature and carpentry
13carpentry because inches scale better or something
we even use microwaves to make doors....
13easier to use fractional widths than mount the decimals of meters
00,02Shizuka, imperial is silly
imperial is overall silly
11,01EQLA stream is done. What are you talking about?
00,10you dont need precision in home construtcion
Uncle Sam personally visited every carpenter in MURIKA and gave them each a statue of Jesus, to remember their humble beginnings.
Construtcion ftw
As he left, a lone eagle perched upon their doors, signalling the truth of MURIKAN heritage.
all these colors lol
Nittany_Discord: How was the closing ceremonies? :)
08,01heh
08,01knob.
13i did see a discussion on it though, on why carpenters don't use metric
there was a closing ceremony?
13it has to do with fractions of an inch that i recall
i thought they canceleld it
Shizuka: ._. Really?
13something about that is easier to work with
08,01Vordox: i don't use gallons or stones
00,10how balls are made
08,01i use litres and kilos
I'm going to need a kickban for what I'm about to say.
PAINTBALL
AW SHIT
maybe imperial is just more convenient historically for industrial stuff
Stone is one of the more famous ones
Buytoast, ... please stop
then dont say it :D
13the bigger reason is imperial has inertia
00,10paintballs omnomnom
Meh, I never liked Paintball.
08,01one of the stupidest measurements ever is miles/gallon
so Paintballs are candies
You dare to try and stop the words of a red blooded MURIKAN?
Tasty tasty paintballs
08,01Vordox: nope
00,10the drop? so paintballs are dubstep?
13it's the measure of distance traveled per unit of fuel consumed
08,01Shizuka: because it's doubly unworkable in metric
boy, look at all that maple syrup
paintballs=dibstep
Buytoast, your ridicule of patriotism is getting under my skin.
13yeah well
dubstep*
13we invented cars
13SO THERE
00,10not sure if case or filler
BTW, I'm supposed to be kickbanned.
Paintballs = shit?

Well I'll be back in about 30 mintues, going to go back home (Was at my families' house for my birthday)

Midnight_Stormwing: Lol
From the ashes of war, we forged MURIKA from nothing but a 50 foot eagle and a handheld picture of jesus holding the MURIKAN flag.
THATS IT
I WON
Phase4, Comcast isn't an invention, it's just a company that delivers service that's generally good but leaves MUCH to be desired.
13yeah well
13vivi invented weaponized wub
BTW, I disrespected my fellow user.
wut :I
they don't care if you disrespect me son
13also you're all missing the point

CrimsonPhoenix: http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/171/mallow.png
:3
13yeah but i hate that solution, means items are still puffing around when they don't need to be
those effects :D
Nittany_Discord, i think he means less forecasting, more of actual making weather
twilight :3
anyone who uses redpower is a wuss and lazy.
But then the Oil companies were all like SCREW YOU and we don't have ATMOS
oh thanks Mutterguy. :)
11,01Ooh.

13i thought the pipe gates would work, only engage an item pull when there's space in the adjacent inventory
11,01Glad it wasn't my maid version.

Shizuka: I couldn't agree with you more right now, as I also adjust mine.
HoodyNinja: i do
Am I the only person with normal vision?
08,01Shizuka: pics?
13hahano
08,01:P
13and you should know better .-.
Shizuka, there's always contact lenses
00,10when I start going blind, I will get a bigger screen
08,01some day shizu, some day
I used to wear them, still got them because they are designer ones.
Picks of just your glasses Shizu?
Why do you think that HoodyNinja? .-.
I also wouldn't mind replacing my eyes with cybernetic equivalents.
HoodyNinja: As in 20/20? probably. :P
08,01Shizuka: i'll just steal a load of cash and fly you over for BUCK
13CrimsonPhoenix: yeah but contacts give me the same shivers as barely watching that segment... you're still sticking something ONTO YOUR EYEBALL
/me recovers from eye surgery bit
...
Kandarihu but the essence cost!
08,01we shall eat all the icecream.
Shizuka: the day we see Shizuka's face would be the day we hear her voice.... which is never
08,01*all* of it.
goddamn random encoding error
Shizuka: What strength?
*nom nom nom nom*
Am i back O-O I dc alot D:
Shizuka, good point
13uh..
13not sure what my prescrip is..
13don't think they ever told me <<
lol
00,10but popplers are people too
Problem is, an EMP would blind me permamently, and probably fry my brain.
08,01DashWithRainbows: that i will
Shizuka you are probaly a +5.5
You're back Arcane
/me 08,01is -2.75 and -2.5
do they ever do a show on how cellos and violins are made?
I'd have to be wearing... FARADAY SHADES!
13my right eye is worse than my left, one or both has astigmatism
13i think the right
08,01CrimsonPhoenix: know what?
Shizuka: Near or far?
Because ew, chocolate.
the making of a guitar?
Gotta be vanilla.
whatever you do...do not search 'animal abuse" on youtube, you will never look at a burgur the same way again
I will
13whichever one means i blur two feet in front of me <<
08,01CrimsonPhoenix: not really, but i know how to make a cello
BUCK = BCUK = Brony Connection UK?
I look at burgers hungrily
13i always forget if nearsighted means you see near or can't see near
AND DONT YOU DARE STREAM IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Shizuka.. are you me?
flutterchu, pfft, I've seen documentaries on genetically modified foods and I can still eat burgers fine.
Shizuka: I'm about -4 either side I think
i only know how to make bows.
alright i'm back
/me listens to the new keith urban album he bought. c:
Because I've already seen what the process because of vegans trying to guily trip me.
Shizuka: wow same thing happens to me :/
Made me want to eat some meat like there was no tomorrow.
00,10I saw the cattle processing videos in culinary school
08,01Stallion_of_War: Brony UK Convetnio
sup guys :)
hi RDash5000 :)
Ohai RDash5000
hey rd
00,10it did not bother me
Shizuka: Just say "I'm need glasses to see (correct thing here)-sited"
ello RDash5000
08,01Sumica: you went to culinary school?
Sumica beofore or after they shoot the cow?
00,10yeah
Shizuka: farsighted is if things a long way aren't blurry
Sumica: i took animal science once, they showed us the pig and cow slaughter videos
13so nearsighted
00,10they use a impact hammer to the brain Mutterguy
aaand im back
Shizuka: Same. :)
13within two feet or so it's fine, and larger print past that
08,01Shizuka: like in UT?
why did i think they use a High pressue BB gun..? oh well.
08,01Shizuka: wow, i did not know that
Shizuka: things start to get blurry for me at about 1 foot
Bullets to the brain also work fairly well.
08,01whoos
i broke my guitar a week before my graduation exam in music school...
13:3
08,01i mean Sumica
00,10BB would contaminate the food
08,01Sumica: what kind of chef?
Delicous cows are delicous
i liked how it's made when it was on dicovery channel
08,01and goddamnit interesting stream
08,01i need to go do work
00,10I am better as a baker
and I need to sleep
but to hell with that
00,10but right now I am a banquet cook
CrimsonPhoenix: Sleep is for the weak
Well, it's not like anybody eats the brain these days though
Bubblegum and fireworks?
fireworks :p
fuck sleep
Shizuka: and text maybe 6 inches
This will be a good episode
HoodyNinja, go get yourself a 40 hours job and you'll love your sleep hours
CrimsonPhoenix: If only I could
40 hours job? .-.
40 hour work week
13the fireworks bit is actually kind of boring, gunpowder into a shell, then more gunpowder, then more gunpowder, then wrap in paper
I am not even sure I wanna see the stream that everyone's watchign that's making y'all freak out.
13then stock footage of fireworks
08,01what?!
13Kurra: that bit's over now :)
Shizuka: yeah I can't read normal text past 6 inches unless I really concentrate
08,01fireworks are really interesting!
Kurra: Lazer eye surgery, its gone now
yeah day shift so I have to wake up at like 6 in the morning
Igot a couple of uncles that work at the Timaru freezing works...
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7481/
08,01i love firework design
Shizuka, was it an... oh okay.
Shizuka: it's more interesting on Dirty Jobs
13it's all procedural, none of the design aspect
00,10yeah most layouts are kinda trade secrets Shizuka
RDash5000, what is that from? That's not from any MLP official series! :O
00,10so they cant show much
13that too
fireworks are awesome california's firework laws are not
13there was a special on discovery or maybe history about fireworks
00,10bleh fiberglass
13they demonstrated the different color stars and all kinds of cool stuff
Kurra: dunno was on the mylittlefacewhen site
00,10sucks if you get that crap on you
13fiberglass, asbestos 2.0
*nom nom nom nom nom nom*
nooooo
00,10I love the firework shows we get here in vegas
fiberglass isn't that bad, it's the polyester resin that's riddickilous
08,01drink everytime he says 'fibreglass'
^
^^
glass fiber composite!
I aint' got no booze!
ah good ol vegas, havent been there in a while
I'm never going to work in a factory EVER
00,10inb4 he never says it again
08,01...
13yeah it's pretty much over now :3
Shizuka: I wonder if carbon-fiber has any problems like that. :P
/me 08,01grumps
:D
No SafariMonkey
I'M ON A BOAT
I was about to empty my vodka bottle
But there has been a worldwide shortage of carbon fiber for like a decade
13nice boat
dat tv
Limo boat
dat boat
So much for drinking tonight
08,01i used to be an alcoholic
sp tiny
Shizuka, Goddang I remember that video
I am an alcogolic
08,01i drank a bottle of sherry every night
i dont drink at all
08,01at least
Kurra: I don't mean really dangerous like that, but one of my friends works with carbon fiber and apparently it's painful to work with, in the same kind of way as fiberglass
00,10but do you know where it came from CrimsonPhoenix?
not even water
ship a boat on a boat
not exactly
SafariMonkey, yah it is
08,01NullRadix: now, i'm addicted to procrastination
I do know it's some japanese video
Kurra: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5630/
00,10it was from the last ep of an anime that got cencored at it's most violent part
hrm... not sure if oxymoron...
D'aww :'3
00,10they cut away to a boat at sea
13ah yeah that one
13because the series was too similar to something that had just happened in japan
A dryer?
00,10because the part in the anime resembled a reallive event that had just happend
Dat Transoformer toilet paper
so that's what all the fuzz is about
Kurra: I've used a bit, I know a guy who makes carbon fiber racing seats and had a bit of a go with some spare
Kurra: :D
since daylight savings ends, does this mean i get more sleep now?
13steel presses are op
13nerfplx
an anticlimatic censor with a boat in the sea with bold character saying Nice Boat with a calming music
Shizuka: You don't get no washing machine
00,10some one while watching the ep on a stream much like ours afer all the rage about the boat
what anime was it?
00,10"it is a nice boat"
how goes?
BroPony|MEDIC|4-4808: I believe that was last night?
SafariMonkey, I can't afford it D: I only laid up fiberglass, but hooooo Celestia's beard was it strong 8O
SafariMonkey: .....:P
00,10cant recall the shows name atm
13was somethign about a school iirc

Shizuka: FISH TANK!
CrimsonPhoenix: well actually ive forgotten that the last fish ive eaten i actually liked, its just that the fish i used to eat in my country was all terrible and stank, it was usually that taste that annoyed me
Buytoast: literally since cephalopods
ugh I hate fish
I dunno I happily ate a seafood salad when I was 8, tentacles and all. Not that that i like octopus or squid. Just don't like the texture
*nom nom nom nom nom nom nom*

at the base of every tasty food errwhere, there is pumpkin pie :>
13but that was when i decided to run a nuclear reactor in
so hungry :< http://delicious-cooks.com/data_images/recipes_01/amazing-real-pumpkin-pie/amazing-real-pumpkin-pie-09.jpg

dolan way of saying bed weeping_pegasi82 :3
why do people take pictures of food?
PEE
FUCKING

eww pee.
flutterchu: Eat the pictures?
i dreamed that i woke up with RD next to me sleeping, she was so cute i wanted to hug her, but then i realized it was just a dream, and was very sad about it
*nom nom nom nom nom nom nom*
bummer. makes sense though
they should have flavored pictures
MisterSkids: You should write a fic about it
now thats a good idea
Call it "My Little Dashie"
HoodyNinja: :D
MisterSkids: that is sad, but at least you had a moment beside her, and that's all the real you ever needed then. That's still a great thing.
well I had a dream that there was monster eating all of the people around me
baad hoodie!
13all this with being able to put ore into a pouch
13that teleports home
I had a dream I died seven times
Then turned into a kettle
The end
13one stack goes in, two stacks come out
true Kurra at least i had one brief moments
If I had that dream I'd always remember what it was like to be wriggled up by Dashie.
i had a dream that i was at school twas horrible
I don't recall ever having a good dream in years. All the dreams I can really remember are sad dreams or dreams where I died. :D
MisterSkids changed the fundamental topic of channel
lol
MisterSkids wins :)
AJIsAwesome: ...
:D?
lol
well my worst one was probably that my parents were killing all of their children and I was the only one left ;_;
i had a Dream of a Darkness area :3
so Shizuka what'cha doing?~
All dese dreams
13pondering
All my dreams are in 7.1 surround sound with 64-bit color, and pain sensation.
mine have involved a time travelling pinkie pie.. I just wake up confused...
my only pony dream was about fluttershy going around selling gum and getting excited ever time she made a sale :)
dreams can never become a reality you know
i remember one dream where i was actually a pony, and everyone hated me
they only serve as lingering reminders of what will never happen
every*
Buytoast: Orly?
i had three straight years of having the same nightmare every night as a kid. beat that
I remember night frights
08,01i had a dream where i was on stage with KISS
08,01but we all had Viols
I wish my dreams would never become a reality my world would be twisted
twilight_sprinkle: Me and my best friend had the same dream on the same night, get some bitch
08,01i could play the Viol, but didn't know any KISS songs
08,01this is largely true irl
twilight_sprinkle: i had a nightmare Of Chucky the doll for 5 years at the age of 8 :3
08,01i used to play in a Viol consort, and i have no idea about KISS songs
HoodyNinja: dreams are a mental recombination of thoughts during the day or about a day, so if you had a similar day its not surprising
thelonepony: 5 straight years every night?
i had a night mare that i got trapped in this haunted house with no way out and the ghost killed my parents, THEN 1 year later my parents looked at this new house and bought, when i got there IT WAS THE SAME HOUSE from my dream
not everynight
twilight_sprinkle: He got eaten bya zombie while playing frisbee
/me dreamt a few times of ponies. Has very dim memories of crying with one, possibly because it was a dream, and was destined to end.
beat that
lol HoodyNinja
pfft, i have deja vu from dreams all the time, MisterSkids
just twice a week sprunkls
Shizuka you saving up the water for a nuclear powerplant?
MisterSkids: Happens to everyone
well my weirdest dream included a catapult, a witch, and my brother which ended with me getting stabbed in the stomach and I actually felt it
Yeah, some of my life experiences have been very similar to my dreams. :D
I knew half the answers to a test because of a dream
Ultra hax
thelonepony: thats less than how many time i gad :P my nightmares was of a skeleton slowly walking into my room and tickiling me >.>
/me had an out of body experience once, except he can't prove it was because he had foreknowledge of a hidden pice of paper he 'found' in the OOBE
there was deja vus and this was a spitting image of the house no less so strange
i had a dream where Scream was chasing me then when i was up agianst a corner he started singing the theme to the suite life of zack and cody. beat that :3
i dreamed of my life that i could somehow never open my eyes and then once when i was at school people were telling me what the hell? are you f<_<king drunk or somthing
isn't his name Ghostface
and not Scream?
twilight_sprinkle: i found what you said adorable :D
thelonepony: adorable??!
/me tingles his hooves
yesh :3
......
Kittens?
thelonepony: its not really adorabl if its a realistic looking skeleton..
I wonder why Shibaru stopped coming here
AJIsAwesome: yes, when i woke up i saw my bros watching the show :D
HoodyNinja WHAT XD
Apparently, Hellsing suddenly stops at episode 13 >.<
08,01i once had a dream where i was in bed celestia
HoodyNinja: :D
ive had many dreams of the sky just dark orange with music like this playing n the backroun, then i jump off a high cliff and before i hit the ground i wake up
im actuelly started writing that dream of RD

twilight_sprinkle: i meant say adorable in a creepy way :D

I pissed my bed last year because I dreamt I was using th bathroom
08,01it wasn't *that* kind of dream...
/me whew
08,01it was more like she bestowed this great sense of inner peace on me
I really wish I could dream about ponies all I have is freaky nightmares
i dreamt of playing target smash on SSBM and when i woke up at 12:00 the gamecube turned on...is that scary?
08,01stayed with me when i woke up, and i had a really good day
:D
no idea
GO HOME SQUID! YOU'RE DRUNK!
Can I ask...what song is this? and the past two?
also this music is epic here....
They've been lovely
after 2 or so years of the same nightmares, i got the ability to llucid dream, i could even wake up at will. so at some point i fought the skeleton, then went outside and it turned out there was an army of them, and i defeated them with my parents, and that nightmare never happened again. i lost the ability to llucid dream eventually too
HOly god I found a full size snickers in my hallows eve stash
Shizuka: what song is this?
13ponies figure out what the music is yet
/me fuck yeah
one comment on youtube said that i would wake up in cum..i dont know what cum is but the next day when i woe up, i had white goo all over me
Shizuka: I hear a piano, 's good enough for me
DAYUM
13flutterchu: .....
flutterchu: ........
:D
08,01i remember in the dream she was warm, had course fur, and smelled slightly of horse, but also of vanilla
........
The new Hellsing ultimate is creepier than the normal Hellsing >.<
what?
/me steals the snickers from HoodyNinja :3
..............
08,01fortunately, this wasn't like The Unicorn Dream
OMG this music is so sad and inspiraing its hard to write
flutterchu: Twas ghost busters ectoplasm

13i have all the OSTs for Haibane Renmei in winamp atm
what's that?
08,01which is waaaay to horrible for this channel
Shizuka: Its beautiful...please keep playing it. :)
^
13think i need a new thing... minecraft is a bit brain heavy this late at night
^^
00,10so what is powering alll this Shizuka?
Didn't get to hear it i think :c
/me thinks of his most favorite dream ever ever EVER
Or is it still playing?
Solar panels?
oh my god, that reminds me of the dream my insane PE teacher told us once, its too ridiculous for chat though...damn my PE teacher was such a retard >.>
HoodyNinja: i guess my hand cant reach through the internet then :<
13quantum generator, new with the latest IC2 i think
13basically infinite power source
If one dreamed about Luna, would she be cold?
00,10magic, got it
13yep
You know, since she raises the moon?
13useful for prototyping
08,01AJIsAwesome: why would Luna be cold?
AttackWithHugs: I don't dream about ponies...
00,10I been having issues with my oil rigs exploding
13also found out it can dump enough power into a mass fab to build a stack of UU in like fice seconds
Shizuka - do you have to manage all the different tekkit mods manually or do you have a manager that updates them for you?
13all the engines are buildcraft electrical
squid
dat squid
00,10it's mostly cooling issues
AttackWithHugs: maybe, but thats what blankets are for ^_^
13MirrorImage: this is the Feed The Beast mod pack run through MultiMC, plus a couple extras they don't have autodownloading yet
00,10the problem with pipes decoupling on relog
You have a um, squid in your tubes, maam
ive yet to dream of ponies .-.
08,01AttackWithHugs: i think Luna has a warm disposition; she's mostly just misunderstood
13squids really need better spawning algos
00,10thought I would try to use a power converter to make my refinery solar
00,10but dont think it works like that
how do you make yourself have a dream?
13actually looks like the electrical engine is pretty cheap
Ah, the average evening on bronystate
I have no idea.
A decade ago a childhood friend of mine died flying a plane. He drowned. v_v About 6 months later, I dreamt that I was in my old house, and my friend was there, same as ever, and we cried and said goodbye, and he said it was all right, neither of us had to griece.
13just needs tin
and onetime i dreamt of walking in an endless field (the same field as the scene where the mane 6 are walking there adventure in "a rose is a rose") but it was nighttime and i see the nightmare moon logo on the moon.........i tried to go in the everfree forest up north but i couldnt see ite so i tried to run back to the oceon to find the mane 6 sleeping but they werent ther, i cried not knowing what to do
08,01weeping_pegasi82: get his by a car while listening to Life on Mars
weeping_pegasi82: llucid dreaming you mean? or have a dream at all?
00,10not sure if there is an electric
00,10in tekkit
suddenly wallsplosion
tl;dr
13there's adjustable electrics
twilight_sprinkle: have a dream at all
13like three tiers i think
they need to make an invention so you can record ur dreams :3
Sumica it works with tekkit, you just ned a restone torch also make sure it;'s petrol. Those explosion are kind of inconvienent
*cuombustion
Vordox, i'm watching Hellsing ultimate now, incase you wanted to know ^.^
And we hugged, and he was warm and alive, and I fully believe God made the long-distance connection from the beyond to let me see him one more time. I absolutely believe that.
weeping_pegasi82: well i believe the more tired you are the less likely you are to have a dream
another time i dreamed of BFDIA 4, but it actually wasnt how i imagined and i KNOW i was going to be wrong
00,10you get enough power from a redstone toarch to run a refinner?
redstone engine
ive dreamt of bronystate several times... i need a life >.<
?
13refiner is running off the electrics over there
13ten electrics
13dunno where they rank compared to the combustion engines though
08,01i had a dream about John de Lancie once
but sprunkls, Bronystate IS your life :3
13probably based on input voltage, which i have at 512 from the quantum cheat generator
tehlonpon D:
08,01he was about the same age as he was in TNG, and we were on a train... wrestling...
00,10best way to judge is to check the color of the pistons on the refiner
13redstone's just running the pumps
thats pretty epic flutterbittin
08,01and that's where i'm stopping that story.
00,10if green then plenty of power
thelonepony: He just loves us so much
I guess she didn't love us :(
well I had to resort to combustion becaue they otheres keeped exploding once I provided power :(
hoodeenija eeyup
i dreamt of Federer a few times, last time i was playing with him 2 vs 2, and i was extremely afraid to let him down
Its alright, don't be ashamed
even at the the lowest voltage
my short dream storys coming along good
08,01HoodyNinja: i think the "beating" was a moot point
13wooden pipe is good for that
13accepts all power coming in, engines won't explode from power overload if they're into a wood pipe
13overheating from lack of cooling is a different problem though
might be the cooling
I once had a dream that I was camping with two of my friends and had a fever so one of my friends held me down and stuck a centipede up my nose to keep the fever from getting any worse
08,01HoodyNinja: i ended up in bed with John de Lancie. Technically, I won.
D8
13saw this coming
13java crash
oh noes!
13the momentum processors are pretty buggy i've found
i played basketball for several years, so after i stopped playing i get occasional nightmares that im near the basket, im totally open and have the ball, nobody is near me and i just need to score an easy shot, and i end up not throwing the ball hard enough and it doesnt even make it to the basket
13probably better to use stock macerator/furnace and overclock them
twilight_sprinkle: gravity often does not work well in dreams
Kurra: it wasnt so much gravity, i just suddenly felt very weak
13uh oh
aww
I feel falling when I dream
dont say that
uh oh?
13crap.. those machines borked the world..
oh uh
oh
ho hu
08,01people often speak of dreams when they are flying

hh ou

08,01i had a dream, just over 10 years ago, that i was flying a helicopter
Most of my nightmares involve me falling and being to weak to stand up
heh i once had a dream of epicly fighting a anime cyborg girl
yeah :/
:D!
And both the chat and Minecraft crash on me at the same time
weeping_pegasi82: I do.
08,01actually, irl, i hate flying helicopters
twilight_sprinkle: Did you get laid?
Crash ALL the apps!
08,01freaky fucking things
HoodyNinja: i dont think so, i just remember she destroyed a bridge during the fight :P
13i'll check
twilight_sprinkle: Win-win
AJIsAwesome|Busy: good so it isn't just me
/me dreams of work often :)
for some reason when i dream that im a superhero who can fly, i always have a pink trail behind me
00,10but yeah I think that is a FTB only item
13almost feel like zonking out to some cosmos..
/me doesn't dream enough or doesn't end up remembering which dreams he had >.>
u shouldnt eat so many pink things they make u fart like that twilight_sprinkle
13the rotary macerator is an Advanced Machines thing, technic and tekkit have it
MisterSkids: i dont eat anything pink though, i dont even like gum :P
lol
cow tools
I
Fucking
tekkit has the Rotary Mac, yes
Love
Gum
doesn't have the Electical Engine yet though
13it has three from Power Converters
13Buildcraft 3 now has the electrical engine in vanilla
my dreams have gotten significantly more unpleasant ever since i played skyrim..
tekkit has the Engine Generators - BC --> EU/t
not the electrical engine - EU/t --> BC. still have to use energy links on that
i had one absolutely disgusting dream a few months ago..
Haven't had a dream in... months now
I guess I'm happy
YAY!
i have a dream every night and i dont like it
13mmm no it does have a EU/t -> MJ engine in tekkit
13i used it on the last world
i hate being so dim-witted in dreams
I had a nightmare last night
NONONONO
howdy all
WAIT NONONONO

/me stands on Allegr0
13slow, regular, fast, and adjustable electric engines
This song has samples of the planning music from Rainbow Six! :O

13transformers mod
The one that just finished! I don't believe it!
what's goin on?
That's insaaaaaane :O:O:O
and i say heeyeahhyeahhh
13tekkit doesn't have a few of the technic mods that are/were SP only
13since tekkit is multiplayer focused
I was being chased by a monster and then my dad said it was all a dream then poof! no monster in the actual dream not in real life
ah
13anyway

siddelthekiddel: i based it off a ytp, and i presume you saw it :$ but i just like it cause it sounds cute, no other meaning intended :D
SuperBrony64: so what did max ask and what was he told?

twilight_sprinkle: I don't like ytp. :3 I just thought it sounds adorable. And I want to make Twi ice cream.

As fast as it can go, the speed of light you know. Ten million miles a minute, and that's the fastest speed there is.
Iiiiiiiiimaginaaaaation~

His imaginiation is a very lonely place... :(
13uphill
13both ways
Sumica: Well, obviously. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds.
on ice
00,10Some day i should stream the radio drama
00,10perhaps after Shizuka sleeps
technically Kammerjunk , division by infinity isnt allowed
you can only take a limit
13radio drama? ours?
00,10hitchhikers guide
13oooo
i wonder what shizu looks like in real life?
you cant get a finite number by dividing by infinity, you cant operate with infinity as a number
*eyes slowly ross*
twilight_sprinkle: I know, I was quoting Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe.
/me hugs flutterchu
13flutterchu: http://i.imgur.com/it7Wi.jpg
pewdiepie: ah god, dammit
Mistress_Rainbowdash: why did you hug me? :P
ok here it my dream
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/61498/A-Rainbow-Dream
13don't blink
randomeness
13don't even blink
13blink and you're nova
Oh, I've read about these. They sound awesome.
lolwat
Not a single blink was had.
13in his imagination he uses the worst UI ever designed
Ciao.
Shizuka, I blinked
/me Abscond.
Shizuka - windows 8?
13mac
that sudden volume increase
13oh oops i'm using stereo mix..
fucking hell, firefox.
because seriously, why would you choose such music
13moment, stereo mix is bad at this....
Ice...
use chrome
13k back on
twilight_sprinkle, I have Chrome but it takes FOREVER to load a page
twilight_sprinkle: I would let Carl Sagan teach me to sleep.
AttackWithHugs: still having problems sweetie?
13sorry, it should have been pulling from line 1, stereo mix is bad for streaming
MisterSkids: YOY *clop's hoofes/paw's* WHOOHOO
AttackWithHugs: thats very odd, i have 50 tabs open and its still quite fast
liked it?
Also, my Firefox is getting slow, but that's because I have some odd hundred tabs open.
meow~
I never close anything.
MisterSkids: oh yes
i enjoy Shizukas streams :3
thx
twilight_sprinkle, Chrome seems to not like me. One tab takes forever to load.
Kammerjunk: you have a hundred tabs open??
not bad for something that only took umm 20 minutes lol
Mistress_Rainbowdash, where did you go girl?
twilight_sprinkle: I used to. I have at least 175 open.
if I keep clicking refresh it'll work right? there we go
MisterSkids: but im sure somebronies experiance that once every decade, EVEN I rmemember having a dream like that, so no need to act like your legendary
rawr
Kammerjunk: D; well that beats my record of 75 tabs, didnt think someone would beat it..
lol
only thing missing is buck rodgers
only 1500 lightyears....
twilight_sprinkle: And I complain that Firefox takes my resources.
00,10the galaxy is on orion's belt
13to prevent war
u should my monolgue or read some time
Kammerjunk: yeah i use chrome though, i also have a tendency to leave everything open, but i dont think my computer could handle 150 tabs
And Orion has no sword... He has a bow?
MisterSkids: aaaaw, that was cuuute <3
huhu.
AND MY AXE!
13i've never understood constellations
Mutterguy: o u
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obt0u57Jr14
13only the big dipper makes any sense
thx NocturnalBlade
still streaming flutterchu...
i like lyra
its a constelation, look it up :3
twilight_sprinkle: I wouldn't know, I don't know how Chrome does with that amount of tabs.

*eyes slowly cross*
Shizuka: I used to be fascinated by the stars when I was young. :D But not so much any more. Pretty much only know about the dippers and Orion.
Kammerjunk: chrome works better for me with large amounts of tabs
13my formative years were spent in phoenix and here in the twin cities
13big dipper and orion's belt are about the only stars you can see
13venus mars and jupiter sometimes
RoseBot`: > 3> Fish. He's a hunter.
twin cities?
Klumzeedragon, thats Lyra
<><
<///< -FISHY
huh stream is WEEEIRD tonight
RoseBot`: :P Well then!
Klumzeedragon: I dare say!
*pokes tongue with a pin* Blood drips* *still smiling* *eyes slowly cross*
Shizuka: Ah, same. I'm in Cali. So I pretty much only see the same as you at night.
I just know about Ursa Minor, and that's only because I see it all the time.
pFFFT Not a planet!
Kammerjunk - no you don't. admit it, the only reason you know about it is because of ponies ^_^
Sorry, the lag must be showing
MirrorImage: I do see it all the time, though. And THAT's only due to walking my dog at night.
Hell, I don't even know what the difference is between Ursa Minor and Major.
Mere... Yes... Very mere.
*pokes tongue with a pin* Blood drips* *still smiling* *eyes slowly cross*
13big dipper's easy cause they're much brighter
13orion's belt you can see cause they're three stars in a line
13the rest are random
We can see Alpha centuri down here
Shizuka: Exactly. They have more visible/noticable traits.
*keeps poking his/her tongue*
*wiht a pin*
Cassiopeia is errwhere
