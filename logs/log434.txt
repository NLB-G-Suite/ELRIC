RAWRity..oh
Then I'm going to have to stop watching it for the exact same reason I had to stop watching on Sci-Fi channel.
2,14 but that's an easier excuse than "I'm too lazy to press the button"
13it's not *bad*... not exactly good though
well, I'm gonna go. Night, all.
00,10lol val
13Angel Beats! was amazing, subbed

13if we were a much, MUCH more mature rated site.... i would put us through elfen lied
how does he still live?
0,14Elfen...Lied?
D: I never got into Elfen Lied.
My tolerance for fanservice is medium. I don't mind it unless a show shoves it down my throat.
EVIL!
0,14I...think I'd have to pas >.>
I vote for Elfen Lied
2,14 >bronies >Mature
haha! now I have confirmation! I am now OFFICIAL! http://i.imgur.com/K5fma.jpg
11,01Elfen Lied is NSFW.
2,14 hahahaahahahaha
00,10otakon Vandread
Why are you on here if at work?
I've heard of Umineko.
NSFW?
SHot the kids. SHOOT THE KIDS.
The nudity is the problem in Elfen Lied?
said
NSFW is not safe for work
damnit
Beck was great
13that and the prolific blood
Hm
Why is he...
I don't care about Elfen Lied's nsfw qualities. I more have an issue with the fact that Elfen Lied is complete shit, yet people constantly try to use it to get people to start watching anime
13story was fantastic though once you got past all that
wooo the wave ~
A show that has imagery that sets off people of a dirtier mindset than mine is okay.
I think he's mentally damaged.
1,3Shizuka, the problem is most people can't
Since I took part in TWO of them
13like i said, if we were a much MUCH more mature rated site :3
I probably would just be watching animaniacs
If we really wanted NSFW, we'd watch Queen's Blade, which is on Netflix, and I know because I accidentally tried to watch it. And on that note, I bid you all good night.
eh, lets keep it at least somewhat family friendly
adn plot shot
dat plot
Yes, she is at the moment a bitch. Just making that clear.
XD
0,14also, that feel when Anarchy Reigns music maxes me feel like boxing
I like her though
Anyone ever hear of Cromartie High School?
And now slave
I hate Talho, she's a manipulative bitch
lol
I was thinking of Yoko when I wrote that.

Apparently, the BBBFF song has a LG reference
seems legit
I don't wanna spoil it though
probably fuel
LG?
see? fuel
Lurren---er- I forgot the name of the anime
Gurren Laggan?!
Gurren Lagan?
gurren lagann?
You kidding me?!
Yup
No way...
I don't see how that song is a reference to that.
^
and then scan again
Hm...
Not really a reference once you think about it
Yeah
More like a coincidence
I'm gonna post the picture here
http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/133584957422.jpg
Soooo
Yeah. Coincidence most likely.
....i forget the "THIS" before broadcasting
i faile
Ahhh.
and people bumping into eachother
silly anime fans don't have brothers and sisters...
People have been bumping into each other for thousands of years.
...
*had a quest
But this "reference" does not seem legit at all.
^
And that's why I just listed it as a coincidence
...actually, you cant even list it as coincidence. becasue that would mply there would actually be explicit similarity between both
like it's no coincidence that two movies can feature... people
hey guys!
Okay, I'm going to go back lurking threads
carry on then
No epic cinematic or anything?
lol, spawn you right on top of them
Just... END
lol, not enough fule

they could make it skipable
simple: skip by clciking
well there was a splash screen at the end of the game("Congradulations!")
how most games let you skip intros or cutscenes

it would be possible

somehow their gene-code takes the genetic information from the parter and remodels it
Or maybe it's all dominate genes.
no
because they actually need the genetic diversity other species offer
I think they only need sex for genetic recombination

becasue it actually destabilizes the gene-pool... somehow

I can't stop laughing at a Twitter trend
The comment was said on a show not only designed to make fun of everyone and everything, but was said as people's opinion. By you taking that and spreading it to cover all of Fox News Network would be like me saying that 'Vanella Ice Cream is bland' meaning that everyone here also thinks that Venella Ice Cream is bland.
:)
...and they kill you
Honestly, why do you care?
I thought it was dropped.

Oy, that hacking caugh is never good.
by that i mean "Arrrrr"
He pirated it.
it is
Blame the publishers.
And you base that on?
I payed for my copy of ME2, and ME3.
there's a huge difference between filesharing and stealing
its not giving tem anything either
Like?
people finally need to learn that
I'm asking you to explain it.
stealing implies that you take fromsomeone something they own by force
How does not paying for something that costs someone else to make not mean stealing?
^
g'morning all
Actually.. no.
same goes for music
the software pirates share as been bought at some pint
No, you don't have that right.
and that is incorrect
piratism is not stealing
If I bought a book that you wrote and printed, and I reprented it and gave it away, would it not be stealing?
Wrong media.
I would be taking away potental business
It's the same thing.
its similar
0.o
I'm scared
Books.
Data.
Oh, simple enough.
Ebooks
then don't speak up.
Don't go starting arguments. How bout that?
as they do not get the money from the sale
ok this is an extreme example. if only 1 person bought me1 and the rest fileshared, do you think me2 or 3 would be made? no that would make terrible financial sense
its liscence fee dodging
Thus, cutting into their market and costing them money.
its on the same level as people avoiding the tv license overall
and thats just a fine
I bought everything before i pirated it usually
:'(
purchasing power?
Look. Downloading it because you're interested in it and not buying the legal product DOES hurt them. Now, if the product turns out not to be worth the money, maybe they do deserve to take a hit.
that my money belongs to them even before i aqquired the said software
it limits how much they spend on videogames. most of the pirates would not have bought it.
I never said that.
i actually did that once. buy i gamei pirated
........
there are no clear studies if the free pr the pirates deliver outweighs the lost sales there

You pay for the paychecks of a lot of people

I don't care if you regret it or not, you are still stealing.
02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
It is theft plain and simple.
its license fee avoidance not stealing
but when i pre-ordered sword of the stars two i got panfully reminded why i picked up piracy in the first place
thoroughly
even now, haöf a year after its release, its still unplayble
Because I do.
publishers get the money, not the devs
And that money goes down the line to the Devs
actually stole becasue they took part of my fortune without any balance
Do you think Developers just print their own paycheck money?

and i like to make this clear: i am not defending myself here. i'm explaining why i stopped bying overpriced things from already too powerfull industries

Ya, that makes a lot of sense.
I am certainly not stealing anything. I am pirating it.
The scilent majority won't waste their time paying for something they get for free.

Mon, thats stealing the disk

I don't watch the streams usually.
14aw :(
I watched Legend of Koora only after I saw it on Nick.
No, I spoke up against theft because it is wrong.
its not impossible but unlikely
You're making the common mistake of confusing piracy with theft.
I perfer situational pirateing, IE down loading games and media that is not legaly offered in the contry that the person lives in.
this chair be high, sez I
i have pirated games and music but i also have a stupid amount of music cd's and bought games
Can't be arsed to copypaste the definitions of pirating and stealing again.
How is using a product without paying for it not theft?
some music i would not have found if not for piracy
^
they treat their paying customers like shit
no. i dont steal
Did you use a product without paying for it?
I use or reproduce their work without permission, usually in contravention of patent or copyright.
stealing isnt the correct term, copywrite infrigment is (i think)
Then you stole, Kammer
14http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2600
its not stealing
I didn't take their property, I reproduced it.
There is a difference.

HiHi

It can be argued that piracy steals the potential for fortune.
I still disagree that I'm stealing it.
Yes. Yes I did.
/me shrugs
:)
notice*
I rent first and then buy
half a year later i got rewardet for that thrust by being blatantly ripped off
Well, I guess that's a good way to go.
hey back all
Having one bad experience is no excuse.
Yes.
Don't ask. Just run.
Because all the arguments are weak at best.
Basically, if you buy used copies and do rentals, you are hurting company profits.

14ohh right x3
gamestop is a good example. because other than pirates, they actually earn fortune with someone elses work without giving them anything
pirates utilise something they didnt create. gamestop profits of something they didnt create
why dont you hate on gamesto for a while and call them thieves?
You want me to hate on retailers?
I hate this conversation.
I hate vans.
Lets go on to Walmart and Winn-Dixie then.
i hate feets

Because they don't produce anything, they jsut BUY things and then RESELL them.

when you buy used, the company that makes zero money off of it
yes. becasue they optain the copies the companies created without giving the companies a SINGLE cent for them

The comapnies have gotten the money they need to break even and then some
Yes, but buying used means the company has lost a sail.

yeah, i backed out when i realised how inflexible everyone was being with differing opinions
But is it company policy?
not even a fun argument if all they do is repeat the same points
Yeah, I felt like submitting my points earlier when it began, but I think it would be ignored in the shuffle.
company wide, no, buy by branch, yes
