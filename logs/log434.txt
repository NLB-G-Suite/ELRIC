twilight_sprinkle: it is NOT
otakon: Any episode with Yoko = Fanservice
otakon: admit it, be objective.
No, really? Yoko!
This is the hot springs episode, correct?

1,3protip: they all have Yoko
otakon: The giant robots are fanservice of a kind
Reikim: that's 80% of the show!
ALL THE SPIT!

otakon: Pretty much.
CupcakeWarrior pretty much yea
The Great and Powerful Gunman
Robospit

0,14I didn't ;___;
0,14I still need to see Thor and Cap
otakon: Except. It. IS.
Tomorrow, I'll watch the actual movie :D
otakon: I consider the majority of the fight scenes to be fanservice.
0,14but will probbaly see Avengers on saturday
Fourth wall break!

Someone neeeds to stream an episode of Ikki Tousen
LONG EARED GUNMAN VERMIN

I think the point has been made
why is that one girl so tiny?
0,14I'm jelly, Midnight_Tempest
does watching this in the same chat as Shizuka counts ?
I'm watching this with my mother.
Kandarihu|Mourning: LOL
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: no sadly
TOken Loli, otakon
Technically, since there's no boobage, Ikki Tousen COULD be streamed on here. It's just that I don't think any of the mods quite hate the viewers that much. Yet.
My girlfriend likes anime, she doesnt mind fanservice :P
point taken val
Kencolt: yikes
I come back to fanservice. nice.
Hm, good point. Shizuka is female.
hmm
otakon k
/me 13isn't really watching though >>
lies
0,14RAWRity, I assure you, if I could stream it, I would
all lies
RAWRity: How has your Katawa Shoujo been going?
RAWRity: If they hated us, they'd stream Evangelion.

Reikim: SHH DAMNIT
Reikim: IKR
2,14 so Evangelion means we hate you all, huh?
13actually not, browsing my library of stuff looking for something to do >>
CupcakeWarrior: pretty good. Just got past the point where Misha comes on to Hisao.
/me is waiting for the day the mods decide to troll with End of Evangelion
13eva means we hate you?
fishy fishy
1,3it'd be entertaining to see Eva with the chat

13i am so streaming Rebuild next time then
HOYL SHI
I like evangelion
Evangelion is overrated

ValtheJean: if you showed that yes

0,14speaking of Eva...
and fanservice
Shizuka: Oh, Rebuild is fine
1,3make sure I'm here Shizuka :)

GODDAMN EDIT!
0,14oh hai Asuka

GAINAX: Fanservice adds to our character development!
otakon oh that's what was under the lights?
Shizuka is best Asuka
I know... Just playing
O_O
Dken2021: eeyup

RAWRity: Thanks for suggesting! Although at present I've been requesting Ghost in the Shell.
Reikim: TRUE.

ValtheJean if you really want to troll the chat you must play lucky star
Dken2021: Seriously, is it?
1,3let's review the eva cast: emotionally distraught, clone, asshole, repressed, anger issues, penguin
1,3did I miss anyone?
Death no

Damn you Val
Anyone want a 4chan reference... MODS ARE ASLEEP - POST PONIES

Shinji's a penguin?

Nope, not lucky star

SunderlandPony89 , yes we do
Evangleion is a long, tortuous , and in the end psychological minfbuck with giant not quite robots.

Lucky Star is a manga with lots of references to anime culture. :P
guess nobodys with me :3
1,3it opens up...
how long is this exactly?
1,3massive
*manga and anime
Admin: links are okay as long as they aren't advertising or vidoes
Well imma go play TF2 again....and kill everyone with my sentry gun.
Lucky Star was the first anime I ever saw
^
Admin: I was refering to people saying this was lucky star and then others denied
or video advertising
Ssh
THE HELL DOES IT EVER END!?
You don't need to lie
no
Thats probably why I hate it so much
I know you have a bad headache from the terminal
:P
Personally, I think the first 2/3 of EVA are actually very good. The last 1/3 though? falls apart and NEVER recovers.
TANG'D
why are we watching Death Note ?
TANG
well, my mind's broke
1,3well, apparently Val doesn't like you at least lol
Thank God I had Gurren Lagann to go to after this.
and then Tang
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: THIS IS DEATH NOTE? FUCK
ikr TheGreatAndPowerfulT
/me has a headache now >.<
Death Note? WAT
that actually looks quite epic
thank god that's over
I knew it
ValTheJean: if you don't like me, then don't talk to me, but stop wasting time kicking me... It's not funny
1,3loop it!
My first Iever saw was Astro Boy on NBC back in the early 60's.
13clown!
Dem woman paintings
twilight_sprinkle: it's not really, it's damn depressing and confusing
ValtheJean otakon requested an encore of that vid

twilight_sprinkle: There's NO way I could watch that more than once

TheGreatAndPowerfulT: SHUT UP!
Reikim: Thats Gainax for you
You see, NOW would've a good time for that Evangelion thing
welcome back Litwick
twilight_sprinkle: it is...for the first 18 episodes or so. Then...their budget ran out and they shit their pants.
/me smacks TheGreatAndPowerfulT with a trout
otakon: depressing doesnt concern me, id take that over fan service any day ;)

They want to visit Luna! :D
0,14Funimation
/me throws a cinderblock to otakon head
Ewww...
2,14 well then, you should think before taunting mods buddy
twilight_sprinkle: then NGE will suit you fine. Have fun puzzling over the meaning of the ending
Wanttogotospace
Fuck yeah Funimation
ValtheJean: WHO TAUNTED!?
13the moon
nah val I never do that
otakon: i like complicated plots
13no luna desktop pony
one of these days, straight to the moon!
13i am disappoint
Nekked men
/me resists hilarious spoilers
One does not simply "taunt the mods"
twilight_sprinkle: no, it's not complicated it's just confusing
Play nice now... I'm not taunting... I could do way worse for taunting... Besides, I'm too tired for taunting... It is midnight after all
that is, think before taunting mods
The first I ever saw was Astro Boy on NBC in thye early 60's.
otakon: how long is it?
twilight_sprinkle: I think it's 20 eps for the first series IIRC
And refresh.
2,14 that's strange. The troll is telling me to behave
Episode 1?
thats fun Kencolt
ValtheJean: what troll? who?
2,14 perhaps it's time for some of that good old power abuse
Kamina: Yes, he is insane enough to take on a giant robot...with a sword.
oh come on! don't abuse your power AGAIN!
ikr ValtheJean
I'm guessing this was the episode they have to wait until they wiat for the manga to chatch up?
/me gets out camera
ValtheJean: you can do better than that, come awn
Yes, troll is trying to make friends, not enemies... Isn't that what being a brony is about?
thats it im fucking doe
done
ugh typing
13wendee lee am i right?
0,14nope
Admin: well being a decent person is too
Naw
since the price is so low, I went ahead and pre-ordered my "Canterlot Wedding" dvd. now to wait until august for it to release...
wohoo more recap filler
2,14 oh-ho, poor poor fool. You have made one very grave error
okay, THIS DID NOT HAPPEN IN THE ORIGINAL EP!
13hmmm...
that too otakon
i thoug being a brony was about the food
Admin: you're still a troll, dude
13that was a very Faye inflection
ooh! great idea! we should watch Great Teacher Onizuka!
DAT KICK!
this is bullshit! damn you edits!
Lola he ded
BROHOOF BRO!
RAWRity: agreed
otakon so this is added backlog?
Dken2021: yes it is added
BOOBS
I WANT
bandai!!
I find it ironic that the most dangerous place on the Internet for trolls...is a chat/stream dedicated to colourful cartoon ponies.
*shakes fist*
Waaaaaa?
What's that? Being nice? Oh Nevermind... You're a mod on a pony irc chat, but not a brony... I don't want to live on this planet anymore
13dat halation
Curse you bronystate, you no let me get sleep
0,14HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Dken2021: although what it's replacin is just Kamina trying to get into the womens' bath and Simon coming to some kind realization
Reikim: its only dangerous cuz we got so many troll mods lol
Admin: go be an hero then.
I do wonder-- where does he get these names?
Nah too tired

CupcakeWarrior: I would have to say Lets Go! Rider Kick!
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: you would be correct... Never seen or heard of this site before in my life, before tonight at least... Its very interesting though...
Just dubs are more prominent
Who wants to play the Akira game with me?
I need to know. Did you stream any Eureka 7 last night?
f
now i wana play poker...
13or i could put people through the heartbreak of haibane renmei
RAWRity1...wait what?

Shizuka: of what?
yes kandarihu
dawwwwww derpy
Whats that, Shizuka?
otakon: But thanks for reminding me of Psychonauts though, I might be able to pick up that game soon
<3 that vid
Shizuka: Or you could put people through the emotional trauma of Madoka. Just sayin'.
Shamroc: testing something
1,3haven't heard of that one Shizuka
brb
RAWRity..oh
SunderlandPony89: it's on LIVE for download for 15 bucks IIRC
Episdoe number?
Then I'm going to have to stop watching it for the exact same reason I had to stop watching on Sci-Fi channel.
***To all available mods*** You guys need to advertise this online more... You know how big of a following you would get with more site advertisements?
Eureka! It's Eureka Seven!
13i could put them through the dub of clannad too
SunderlandPony89: or was it ten?
Shizuka lives in TV, doesnt she?
do pinkie reads about bronies
/me would be amazed if brony state had tv listings
Shizuka: Whats so bad about the Clannad dub?
2,14 but that's an easier excuse than "I'm too lazy to press the button"
Admin well yeah it is, but it can and probably will get weirder.
otakon: My hard drive is WAY to full at the moment, so I gotta find a physical copy
Shizuka: your thinking of putting us through terrible dubs aren't you?
Shizuka: Clannad would be great, but not as a dub...but im fine with it either way
13it's not *bad*... not exactly good though
SunderlandPony89: oh, check Amazon
well, I'm gonna go. Night, all.

Deeeeeelicious
Sanvich?

Dammit, why do I have to sleep? I should just stay here all night and watch anime...that's life for you. Night, everypony.
pootits
dat Lyra
Sumica: hate what?
13if we were a much, MUCH more mature rated site.... i would put us through elfen lied
how does he still live?
Shizuka: oh god not that
Oh god shizu
Shizuka: Don't you even dare think about it!
0,14Elfen...Lied?
D: I never got into Elfen Lied.
MakerDusk: anime
sounds fun Shizuka
SaxyPretender: it's EVIL
My tolerance for fanservice is medium. I don't mind it unless a show shoves it down my throat.
EVIL!
0,14I...think I'd have to pas >.>
Thats weak, Shizuka
SaxyPretender: No! It's a trap! No!
Night Reikim
I vote for Elfen Lied
2,14 >bronies >Mature
Shizuka: why not Gantz while your at it?
haha! now I have confirmation! I am now OFFICIAL! http://i.imgur.com/K5fma.jpg
11,01Elfen Lied is NSFW.
2,14 hahahaahahahaha
Double user powaaaaaaaaaaaah
ValtheJean: hey! we watched Band of Brothers dammit
Why are you on here if at work?
So much nudity in Elfen Lied
Shizuka: Or Higurashi?
Sumica: it doesn't have that much fanservice
NSFW?
any chance for hellsing ?
2,14 yeah, and boild into a flamewar almost every time :P
SHot the kids. SHOOT THE KIDS.
OOH OOH What about Beelzebub? Or Beck Mongolian Chop Squad?
CupcakeWarrior: and head explosion
Sumica: besides, it's a interesting take
The nudity is the problem in Elfen Lied?
what TheGreatAndPowerfulT
said
NSFW is not safe for work
damnit
Beck was great
13that and the prolific blood
Hm
Why is he...
I don't care about Elfen Lied's nsfw qualities. I more have an issue with the fact that Elfen Lied is complete shit, yet people constantly try to use it to get people to start watching anime
LadyCanary: Whats Beck?
13story was fantastic though once you got past all that
wooo the wave ~
A show that has imagery that sets off people of a dirtier mindset than mine is okay.
I think he's mentally damaged.
1,3NSFW = Not Safe From Wrek
ValtheJean: it did not, they were discussions that were calm and collected PLUS it usually wasn't even ABOUT what was on stream.
NSFW = Not Safe For Woona
I like Elfen Lied, needs an ending though
1,3Shizuka, the problem is most people can't
Since I took part in TWO of them
kirzstryfe Not Safe For Wooona
Kirz: this
13like i said, if we were a much MUCH more mature rated site :3
CupcakeWarrior: A really fantastic anime, involving lots of great music paying homage to great classic rock bands. And the characters are pretty damn great.
CupcakeWarrior: anime about some guys trying to become rock stars. it's really really good.
RAWRity thanks for the ninja'd
00,10oh it has alot otakon and i dont mind it just warning em about it
I probably would just be watching animaniacs
If we really wanted NSFW, we'd watch Queen's Blade, which is on Netflix, and I know because I accidentally tried to watch it. And on that note, I bid you all good night.
eh, lets keep it at least somewhat family friendly
adn plot shot
Mfw iPad autocorrects kirz as kira o_______o
I take exception when a show seems to say "Here are some clearly defined large breasts. There is lots of cleavage. You are ORDERED to have a boner RIGHT NOW!"
dat plot
0,14later Reikim
kirzstryfe: Nevermind... I tried to help, but your explanation suits wayyyy better xD
Yes, she is at the moment a bitch. Just making that clear.
hahahahaha
XD
0,14also, that feel when Anarchy Reigns music maxes me feel like boxing
I like her though
Anyone ever hear of Cromartie High School?
Oh come on, we've watched "Lupin III: A Woman Named Fujiko Mine", surely Bronystate can handle a few boobs
And now slave
LadyCanary: it's funny
I hate Talho, she's a manipulative bitch
RAWRity pun or not pun intended ?
lol
LadyCanary: I think Ive heard of it, whats it about?
had to move Lyra
I was thinking of Yoko when I wrote that.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: not
RAWRity k then i agree
Aw yeah no more autocorrect shit
altho it is latish'
CupcakeWarrior: It parodies those high school delinquent movies. It's absolutely absurd and hilarious.
Something anybody who's a sci-fi/horror fan should watch: Serial Experiments Lain.
Later guys, I gotta get some sleep
late-ish
Yes, I suppose it doesn't get any worse than Eiken. But I see it happening in other series, too.
ValtheJean: who is the dark skinned chick again?
night, SunderlandPony89
0,14man the rappers they got for Anarchy Reigns are so goooood
Well, gtg to bed finally... Thanks for making my first night on #bronystate one of the greatest ever... Now ValTheJean, please so me the honor of kicking me so I don't have to find a way to disconnect from my iPad? Be a pal
I am waiting for Funi to rerelease Lain befoer seeing it
2,14 yeah no
If you could plz

I would not
ValtheJean: lets do this without insults
Yay Saxy
1,3Saxy, you didn't need to do that
He got banned
oh my
1,3there are much better ways
2,14 yeah, maker's already klining him
and then Holland beat a LFO on foot

MakerDusk is Kira in crack
ouch
wait, you can ban from ponychat?
Yes
0,14yep
2,14 the network admins can
If your an ircop
otakon be afraid be very afraid
few days ago i was thinking of burning Katamari Damacy for PS2 and playing it on my PS3 (since i have one now)
but turns out that it's still hard to play pirated PS2 games on PS3,
zo i decided to emu it on my PC, the PS3 controller drivers are a bit troublesome though, but it works eventually
i might see if i can find a 2ndhand copy of Katamari Forever for PS3 for cheap, though i put my PS3 back in the box when I finish ripping SACDs because i don't really have a permanent place for it
i'm not really that sure I want to use my PS3 for gaming yet. Also, the seller gave me a 90 day warranty, which is voided if i open the case (eg, to get a bigger HD)
well, thats what different Ips are for...
ValtheJean: So he can never get on ponychat again?
2,14 if people are evading our bans, the irccops can kline them, since it violates ponychats rules
>_>
00,10I always read that as Ir Cop
the hell, that seems a bit out of your jurisdiction to decide to ban someone from ponychat altogether
Yep. Bans are real. Cow was just permabanned a few days ago
2,14 CupcakeWarrior: pretty much
But thats only if you... Well are a dumb arse
00,10instead of IRC OP
and back somehow
What?
How?
He came back
2,14 otakon: that's the ponychat rules
cant he just IP change?
1,3really?
...BAHAHA
Bad this is being done from an iPad kirzstryfe
Dayum hes good
Admin_: dude, they are gonna ban you from ponychat, stop!
12ouch
1,3are you really that attention deprived?
2,14 evading a ban on any ponychat network merits a network ban
ok
whatever
Poor cow334 :(
Well he akready got klined
because there isnt the itnernet
Jut wanted to say hi

Katamari FOrever is kinda rare & hence expensive here, $80 for new, can't find it used
otakon: Yep
Admin_ interesting just proxys ?
I don't want bans, just to watch
03I could send you mine

cow was permabanned. Indeed.
otakon: Ban evasion
I like this chat room
Inb4 Lazengan overload on his poop
otakon, for poor spelling
just avoid the ban, geeze....
03assuming I get MultiMAN to stop breaking
11,02Ban evading is a SIN and is a one way ticket to the firey depths of BRONY HELL, now, if you'll all rise with me, we can reach to the sky and praise the mighty Celestia and Luna and chant in song!

/me dances on SuperBrony64 s head
2,14 because I enjoy watching IRCCops exact vengeance
SuperBrony64: what stopped me?
ValtheJean: I don't think he can come back
domU even
Hey!
whichever
well Xen's IP is hidden and I don't think drf would be happy to go through firewall rules
HEY!
and I spoke too soon
And then.. firewall windows with err
XD
Something?
My god, their voices are annoying
wow, he's persistant
/me picks up DeathStar and gives her a hug "Ohai :3"
2,14 krakass, that's actually a *very* good way to get yourself banned from the network
This people, is why we password Usernames
1,3wouldn't advise that Krakass
when he wants to do some moar torrenting of porn
Don't hurt me, please?
Lol Karkass
o-o
Aaahh
U crazy
:}D
Krakass: whay's up man?
Time to hurt Krakass!
/me hugs SuperBrony64 back
0,14bad Krakass
/me starts playing with his tonfas
/me doesnt hurt anyone
and then they killed him
Stop delaying Jake! TO SLEEP!
03because I don't make people challenge-accept attack me

/me is killed

WHO SAID THE PILLOWS

/me revives SuperBrony64
LadyCanary: SaxyPretender did
Thank you MakerDusk for staying your hand.
true, but blocking the connection for 15mbps is kinda... stupid
The Pillows are awesome
otakon...have you become one of the many people who yell at screens expecting the charcters to respond..
/me is alive :D
Krakass: what did you do?
pillows are best pillows
Meh. I think I'm gonna go to sleep now. See you guys tomorrow.
They make me happy :3

Also you would know if they rebooted is as
Night bobeh
Krakass: oh, you lucky you didn't get banned
I know it
$uptime
Krakass: SO lucky
yo
Awwwww D:
well I don't know if drf rebooted or the host did
2,14 I don't mind Krakass, but you should *really* watch it. Because it's A LOT harder to appeal a network wide ban
Alot
Cuz that shit srs
He wouldnt have rebooted xen though?
I just realize that I didn't say hello to everyone when I first came on some time ago, so I'll just say "Hello!" now.
yes
oh hello Twi_Fi
hello Twi_Fi :)
since you can't get on the network to talk to us
nfi ask him, I don't reboot
damnit, i like this show now
hai Twi_Fi :3
MakerDusk: don't you hae a email?

11,01Quite a riot.
80 what?
oh go

/me dances

03$80
Asking them why they cut your net over 20Mbps isnt getting on there dark side :P
03it's supposed to be about 37EUR/month
<,<
/me giggles.
03so unless they billed me multiple months o_O
otakon: shes being a strong indeoendent black woman in the military right now
ZE GERMANZ
/me dances on LadyCanary s giggle
Why cant Lyra be real?!

ValtheJean: oh what?
03OK I think I misheard a line in this song
03as "cell phone walling"

0,14I miss Lyra ;__;
D: But Lyra is mai waifu
Same
My opinion is that Lyra is a pony.
...YES
ValtheJean: you've said that about everything, she's actually not an asshole she just liked attention
Lyra was cool
lol cell phone walling?
she was disruptive but friendly and actually nice
2,14 oh look, the fucks I give are flying away
so they obviously had to permaban her otakon
Lyra is pretty cool. She plays the lyre and doesn't afraid of anything.
Actually Lyra isnt mai waifu until RAWRity confirms it

Spell-of-Gaming: as B's probably
Well, I guess k-lining me didn't work after all did it kirzstryfe?
SaxyPretender: ever thought about joining a squadron on ACAH?

ikr ValtheJean
2,14 everything is under my control

Now that I'm back, will you guys stop banning me please? I'm trying to apologize... sorry :=(
2,14 the IRCcops? nahhhhhhhhhhhhh, totally isn't them *sarcasm*
Dont get DDoSed by 10Mbps
ESG runs /znc listusers
ValtheJean: do you control the verital and the horizontal?

0,14can't really say I have, Pinkies4thWall >.>
and also /znc *lastseen show
1,3Val gets you when you're vertical, I get you when you're horizontal :3
I played portal today/yesterday and it was fun
overall that's 1000 lines in a few seconds
2,14 kirz likes it horizontal ;)
otakon: ok I will...
mIRC won't handle that, but yeah, the RAM definitely restricts it
twilight_sprinkle: i've seen the movies. they're fun to watch
ValtheJean: wow that's creepy
b0rk
anyway
Have fun with IP tables
:D
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

just gimme yours and I'll copy it :}D
and gone already
And peace is made?
I use shorewall

this anime has so many details
the war is 2010

Fight! Fight! Fight!
i missed it

dentidiot: a lot..

i dont watch anime
Mutterguy: it's ok I have great balence :)
It's all complex
And weird
i never payed attention to the old mans reaction..
wat?
i notice that, even for anime, these characters look quite freaky
Though it must have been at some point given the backstories of people
/me dances on Mutterguy s head more
Dark_Horst: its basically a stylization, its fitting imo
and whi makes faces like that?
outside of ponies I like most of the things I watch to be serious and complicated @_@
tomato
code geass characters are really lanky looking...
Basically the EU invade the British Isles and won

Mutterguy: why you stand so still?

Scoutaloop: that's nice dear
Isn't CLAMP a group of women, Sumica? :P
dentidiot: cuz the anime is japanese
00,10Scoutaloop is loking to join the short list i see
dentidiot: really?

00,10best i can say is refresh the page and see if you can get a better conection.

naitmeru
Anime with robots is kinda overrated
WOOOT CODE GEASS
depends on how they handle the robots
not fake terrorists
a lot of it ends up lame
/) ValtheJean
Spell-of-Gaming: robots are a very minor part of this anime tho
/me dances on robots
ORANGE
LOL orange

Spinning life or death formation!
00,10damn that is alot of team attack
2,14 nah, it only counts as a single attack
) eyyup
lol Sumica still does less then any of guren lagans attacks..
00,10oh, lame
2,14 his knights aren't playable, they only appear in his ultimate attack
Dat float

Ahhhhhhhhh
Twi_Fi, did you know it has robots?!
00,10SRW is like all mech animes rolled in to one tatical turnbased game
2,14 I would stream Sai-Sei hen, but my PSP streams keep crashing
2,14 and it bugs the hell out of me
Spell-of-Gaming, I suspected as much.
/me attempts to dance on knowlege of this game but can't bacuse it's too small
00,10did you try compadibilty mode on the program val?
2,14 yeah
2,14 it doesn't run without compatibility mode
00,10ahhh
<_<
Suddenly Float unit
>_>
00,10must be a realy old program then
2,14 I'm really not sure what causes it
2,14 it doesn't seem to happen to anyone else
2,14 DCD doesn't even know
AWWWW YEAH
gawain is so cool
00,10must be a program you have that he doent
that nightmare is hardly an attacking frame tho
Oh god I just read a fanfic about the CMC learning the word fuck :D
00,10or perhaps a damaged install
2,14 if you all want, I can try streaming it again after this episode
are we just watching one fight sequence but with different fucking bastard every time?
grammar
damnit
/me dances
and now back to your regular programming
/me noms DeathStar
00,10it's a clip of the cannon fodder enemy geting killed with all the diffrent attacks from code geass units
ok
2,14 yeah...I'll give the PSP streaming one more try after this ep
CupcakeWarrior: oh noes! i is nomed!
2,14 let's just hope it works
00,10needs more moonpunch from aquerian
dat Ninjazz
Hello everyone
2,14 IKR?
Dat CupcakeWarrior
hi Ninjazz
2,14 every time I try it the damn thing crashes
2,14 it makes me so sad
Ohai DeathStar
HELLO Ninjazz.
Twi_Fi, HI.
00,10I dont even have a video cable for my psp
hi Ninjazz
2,14 you don't need one
hi Ninjazz
ValtheJean: Wait ahich program are you talking about?
somepony_else, hello.
I have an ice hat
2,14 all you need is a USB cable
Pinkies4thWall, Yo!
2,14 and a male to male audio cable for the sound
+20 friendship!
Dat Val stre...
LEVEL UP
dat spinzaku
Code Geass?
00,10but then again I dont have many PSP games
Pinkie Pie would wear an ice hat in the summer heat.
Ninjazz: yuuuup
Ah...that makes it easier...I didn't know you could stream PSP video like that.
:/
00,10got like FFT patapon and a couple rpgs
A WITCH
I was planning on making a webcam mount and use the male-male audio jack XD
Ninjazz: wat.
BUUUUURRRRN
I love playing my psp on the computer
00,10what program val?
2,14 remotejoy
twilight_sprinkle: I'm not a fan.
Ninjazz: ill crucify you.
twilight_sprinkle: You can try. :)
Code Geass was very dramatic. I never saw the ending coming.
twilight_sprinkle: I hate Geass as well
00,10mhmm, wonder if it's the same company that made my kikijoy adaptor so i can use my ps2 controlers on pc
code geass is an amazing anime
I'm in the same camp as Ninjazz, though I do make an exception for any time Kallen's on screen X3
/me rescues Ninjazz and learns him the series
However... One part of it felt just.. .wrong
/me eats CupcakeWarrior
Sumica: remotejoy can do that as well
I never said I hate it... I just don't like it very much.
Sumica: Oh wait nvm
00,10it can be a hardware adaptor?
NOOOOOOOOOOO
00,10impresive software indeed
Ya'll know it if you've seen it. Where Leluche applied his Geass on the wrong person with a horrible order. That felt.. forced.
Sumica: I thought you meant ps3 controller 6_9
NIPPON BANSAI
Almost as forced as the hibernation lesson during the Winter Wrap Up episode of MLP
inb4 bloodbath
well, fun
DAMN
Daayuum...

WTF
That was harsh as hell.

MahBoi777 away from keyboard

Mutterguy: I can now die happy

They've probably used things stronger, Shane377.
I wish the royal wedding was a full length movie
out of context, I really don't like listening to the cutie mark crusader's song
LOL super duper nukes

Who else agrees that a small amount of the Royal Wedding was a bit rushed?
i have no idea of that song

I love writing Ditzy Doo dialog. Tell me what ya'll think of this: "Hi! I heard you talking really loud so I came to see what you were talking really loud to!" The pony said as she lifted off the ground with her wings. "I thought at first that you gave the tree a name and was arguing with it and trying to get it to go inside, which is silly because trees don't talk or walk and I don't think
they like being inside or else they would have built their own homes, right? Well, there was that tree during the school play but there was somepony in that!" She giggled as she floated around Rarity. "
<_< >_> im not leaving yet...
now i'm sushi again
bai Midnight_Tempest
cupcakewarrior: it had more story than a lot of full length films :) the only part i would have changed was when chrysalis owned celestia it made celsestia look realy weak :P

It's not hot anymore. :3
>_>
Midnight_Tempest: But text is 99% of IRC's diet
Well, now it's mostly a water hat.
cupcakeswarrior: i would have had celestia hit chrysalis and knock her back and right when celestia is about to end her, chrysalis would turn into luna causing celestia to freeze and giving chrysalis a chance to hit her with that spell, but thats just my idea.
I wish I had a water hat
CupcakeWarrior: but too much can make it choke
Still best ep EVAR!!!
dat bg music Sumica
TheDr: Sounds better than Celestia just being beaten like that.
maybe both
Holy crap, that a good tune going on.
Applejack is Shepard's favorite pony
Sumica: i want dat song
CupcakeWarrior: Fact.
ITS GETTING LOADER OMFG!
the wall is made of jello
Sumica: CAN U just stand next to the speaker plz
SONG
ninjazz: ya thats what i thought, i think they did it they way they did because they were already stressed for time and could not have a major battle between those two!
Troll Shepard, listening to your conversations
"This is Commander Shephard and Applejack is the best pony of all Equestria."

13scavenge it off the many corpses of your enemies!
Sumica: What was the point of buying the fish feeder?
/me throws miseltoe over DeathStar and Shirtless_Tempest
00,10so I dont have to
/me watches dancing
13:3
no point shipping them. It's already sailed
Shizuka: but if you killed your enemies dosen't that mean there armor isnn't as good
Is being a accidental hipster good or bad?
13nah, just means they didn't know how to use it
lower afterlife is better
low fi epic
If you throw a hipster into a river, does he become mainstream?
haha CupcakeWarrior
I should buy Minecraft really soon
CupcakeWarrior: no because a river is not the same as a stream
he just becomes another body stuck in the dam downriver... so nothing of importance was lost
Or I'll get called a hipster

garrus is too old for this shit
Sumica: may i introduce you to my memory of people. i'm guessing the part in my brain that regulates that seems to behoggering all the sleep that the rest of my head doesnt get
I just got back from the store - those insomnia shopping trips always have the most interesting results - spent 150 on dvds
TheRainbowDash, what kind of fieldtrip is this?
lol
Ninjazz: A school field trip out of state to Philadelphia, and I'll be spending the whole day there, from 6:30 AM to near 9:00 PM.
So, that means I can not attend <ovie Night also...:'(

Phase4: Oh, alright, how old is your laptop anyway?

Ninjazz: medigel resurrects

I am not a noob. I jst haven't played ME3 yet.
i never ran out of medigel in ME3
just*
TheRainbowDash, my dead one was 3 years old, was a little outdated when i got it. this is a lower end model from the same year
and my teammates died a lot in that place

Phase4: Oh, alright. How much will you spend on this new laptop? Maybe around 1000 dollars, or something of that range?
Mica

is the writer of this piece a secret brony?
look at the first few sentences
BillClinton is here?
only 2, roomate & brother, I'm sure to hear about at some point today :)
BillClinton: "Buck the system:" i belive so
:)
o.o
i don't think non bronies use that term, do they
Wait, who is here?
Buck the system: Hacking work - finding ways round restrictive systems in the workplace - has risks but could benefit your whole company, says Josh Klein
literal quote from the BBC website
yes. Buck is used like that in real life.
BillClinton: Hmm, I'll go check that out, but sadly, I have to go now.
ok
Who in their right mind goes to parties to drink on a THURSDAY night anyway?
"Buck the trend" for instance.
Bye everypony, and I hope to see you, tomorrow.:) Again, signing off for the first and last time today, Dash.

Awww Pinkie's BD is over.

i think hanging might be unhealty, considering space. you'd get a nasty cold
I just lurked a thread
HOOOONK!
fucking traffic jams
Apparently, the BBBFF song has a LG reference
seems legit
I don't wanna spoil it though
probably fuel
LG?
sumica must be mass effecting the universe
see? fuel
Lurren---er- I forgot the name of the anime
:X
Gurren Laggan?!
Gurren Lagan?
gurren lagann?
You kidding me?!
Yup
No way...
I don't see how that song is a reference to that.
^
Yeah no freakin way
and then scan again
Hm...
Not really a reference once you think about it
Yeah
More like a coincidence
I'm gonna post the picture here
I mean half of the anime is about Kamina and the kid calls him "big brother"
EY! yeah, you, space squid faggers! take a look at broadcasting phalanx!
http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/133584957422.jpg
Soooo
Yeah. Coincidence most likely.
....i forget the "THIS" before broadcasting
i faile
Ahhh.
and people bumping into eachother
silly anime fans don't have brothers and sisters...
People have been bumping into each other for thousands of years.
that'S like the guy who said WoW referenced some cheap no-name mmo that nobody nows because both that a quest where a kid was looking for his uncle
...
*had a quest
Not you Spell-of-Lurking
Not raging at you.
But this "reference" does not seem legit at all.

And that's why I just listed it as a coincidence
this looks like so much fun...
...actually, you cant even list it as coincidence. becasue that would mply there would actually be explicit similarity between both
like it's no coincidence that two movies can feature... people
hey guys!
Okay, I'm going to go back lurking threads
carry on then
That is lame as hell.
No epic cinematic or anything?
lol, spawn you right on top of them
Just... END
lol, not enough fule
/me rolls up newspaper and bonks Ninjazz
and THATS what really annoyed me. the reapers catch you and that fucking screen is ALL you get?
Ohhh no.
/me runs away from Claude
wow, one of my friends is going to hate this part of the game
:D
what the flying fuck, bioware? no ctscene? no tragic ending? no blowing up normandy?
the normandy is now a scout
they could make it skipable
simple: skip by clciking
well there was a splash screen at the end of the game("Congradulations!")
how most games let you skip intros or cutscenes
hm... maybe something like loading on the run?
it would be possible
indeed
XD
spawn you ontop of reapers
Is it safe?
/me looks around
>_>
<_<
^_^
v_v
and much less probing than ME2
take this with you /)^3^(\
lol
Mica

welp, saves ya work
Something tells me that the Reaper chases to death thing was a last minute addition
It sucks.
moo
wait a minute...didn't you have the higher cap fuel in ME2?
nope
indeed, there seems tobe no real reason for that. i mean, reaper presence gets reset after every mision
might have been able to get one but its 1k by default
lame
they have absolutely no value besides making kundane shit annoying
harder
Miranda?...
alliance: oh hey, this ship got upgrade out of the captains own pocket and effort? well then, let's throw that shit out then"
fanservice pan
butt shots...everywhere
sumica has face is doin that thing
BUTT
DAT ASS
hes*
taking ques from the star wars sequels I see
"shut up sheperd, i'm dramatic and you cant stop me"
walking talking shot reverse shot
None of you might not notice this... But Miranda has a slight jiggle to her breasts... I think.
meep
so hes face gets bucked when he is a dick
she looks skinnier
http://i50.tinypic.com/141t3q.jpg Changeling Queen is best pone.
JR
Or wather
like she got stretched out
Swiss Cheseelegs
Yes
it'S because of his implants. being a dick is bad zen, hinders the healing process
or some new age shit like that
got distracted by Whose line is it anyway?
and all that stuff
...then again, they completely rebuilt him from a pile of charred flesh over the course of two years
including the brain??
and suddenly, hey, sheperd is back, same old dude, somehow is councious stayed intact while being literally no more than fried bacon
Garrus
You are the man
...
Mutterguy: well he fell from orbit onto a planet. i think that would pretty much fuck up everything in the body
re-entry friction provided the barbeque and then splat
that's almost feasible
:S
what
...yeah right. helmets keep asteroids intact
suuuuuure
I said almost
how does helmets have anything with asteroids
hmmm hes face isent really dick like yet
becasue shepard was an asteroid once
the helmet becomes an asteroid
what??
the asteroid becomes diamonds
that requires a big asteroid of very high density
but we're talking about a squishy head inside a helmet
astronomy is confusing
not really the most dense or massive structure
if it has no oxygen it'd preserve his head
then ...dead??
well, the planet did have an athmosphere
lol
pony_7160: yes, sheperd was dead. for two years
also the the helmet is composed of diamond rubber
Am I the only one who only get good ideas right before falling asleep?
Nope.
he got blown out of his ship, drivted through vacuum for a minute, fell onto a planet
the ending of all the ME are always the death of sheperd
...SCIENCE!
pony_7160: actually no
with a STICK
he died in the first one. got rebuilt
the stick
he survived the second one
ME1
...if you didnt screw up majorly
heh...i never play ME lol
how inconvenient
Awwww
those bastards!
11,02Night all ^_^
oh those guys will get one hell of a field trip when the reapers bugger off with the citadel
bye SuperBrony64
night SuperBrony64

Blasto : Nanny for Justice
hi guys
ghostbuster, welcome.
...or should i say facebucket?
/me slaps SuperBrony64|Zzz around a bit with a large trout
Well, you gotta admit... She got a lot hotter
she dont even have a face ...
mass effect again?
why would dickshep care fo rher
yup
actually it seems like they wanted ashley to replace miranda in the "nice to look at, otherwise useless" departement
because tali away with the fleet
VODKA TIME
drinks....
i have a question....stfu
heh??
that is not a valid question
the new romance system is sneaky as hell anyway
sheperd can have sex with his crew....
i played as femshep, didn't do anything that i know off, bam, suddenly the mail-console lady got pinned as romance
dang it. He should have parked us next to Blasto
ghostbuster or not, its easy enough to avoid it
If I did play Mass Effect, can I make it so Sheperd doesn't have sex with his crew?
i have no idea how the fuck that happened
Mon|WearingIceHat yes, its not hard
Mon|WearingIceHat sure but ewhat's the point?
Mutterguy you get an extra scene
if you have no love interests you get a scene with garrus
Mon|WearingIceHat: and no, it'S not porn
The fact that I can say that I had a little more respect fo rmy crew than that?
about how universe more important than love or something
aww
hehe
sentimental garrus
but I'm old fasioned like that.
pony_7160 you need a name
Well, its not like its a goal or something
i like this way
You can just be friendly from the get go
...
Ghostbuster!
well anyway, after that happened, later in the game i walked in on tali and garrus making out in the main battery room
How you doing budy?
*buddy
what
mica
...how the hell do you get turian mandibles and a quarian HELMET to kiss??
i don't get it
hehe ....gay porn
wat?
Someone on Fox and Friends is wearing something that I bet Rarity would think was 'Fabulous!'
whisky- hell of a drug
You're watching Fox?
Yes
Problem?
Not really.
Awww
Just wondering why you would watch them after the thing they said about bronies, is all.
There's a pony on Fox
i watch starworld most of the time
What are you talking about, Ninjazz?
You mean Red Eye?
/me claps
Sure, why not.
olol
dick shep is a bag of dicks
Ok, i want to teach you a word.
....discovery channel
Satire.
It's a noun.
:/
and what is that..?]
Sumica: what exactly did she say there about dicks? i lagged at the precise moment
the use of irony, sarcasm, ridicule, or the like, in exposing, denouncing, or deriding vice, folly, etc.
2.
a literary composition, in verse or prose, in which human folly and vice are held up to scorn, derision, or ridicule.
hai RX-78-SleepyBot
Human bag of dicks
welcome RX-78-SleepyBot
Okay, stop right there.
It's funny.
oh my
dicks dicks dicks...lalala

O
wait
anthrophcene (sp?)
she?
sheperd has no soul
Hey guys.
...
TheRandomkid321, welcome.
meaning: it's a whole race of hot looking women. so the reproduction thing goes a little bit different
lazy
it was anthropocentric bag of dicks
You mean like the Garudo from Legend of Zelda?
hehe...gay porn
somehow their gene-code takes the genetic information from the parter and remodels it
Or maybe it's all dominate genes.
no
what
What?
because they actually need the genetic diversity other species offer
I think they only need sex for genetic recombination
ah
so like when zues fuck a chipmunk born pikachu???
becasue it actually destabilizes the gene-pool... somehow
zues?
Honestly...
and has a chance of creating ardat-yahkshi

SCIENCE !!!! YAY
Invi, welcome!
oh god
...dragon age
I can't stop laughing at a Twitter trend
/me hugs Ninjazz
The comment was said on a show not only designed to make fun of everyone and everything, but was said as people's opinion. By you taking that and spreading it to cover all of Fox News Network would be like me saying that 'Vanella Ice Cream is bland' meaning that everyone here also thinks that Venella Ice Cream is bland.
:)
oh and for anyone who didn't now, ardat-yahkshi are basically biotic sex-vampires. just tossing that one out
...and they kill you
Ello, Bronystate!
Honestly, why do you care?
Blue_Leaf, welcome.
moin Blue_Leaf
"Boyfriend Video Made Us Wet" PFFFFFT-HAHAHAHA
I thought it was dropped.
Dickshep is about get medievel on ya arse
Thanks Invi and Ninjazz!
Ninjazz: a quest in ME2 had you hunt down an ardat-yahkshi. it taught the players all that
Because generalization and judging by indirect relation is wrong.
Ninjazz: they also make an appearance in this game
Talking about something else, Dark_Horst.
:$
Ninjazz: sorry then
No, its cool.
Monfang: I was only wondering, okay.
Monfang: No need to get all riled up.
Now you know.
Not going to make that mistake again, are we?
Amazons

Seriously? The Beliebers are stupid

The Boyfriend Video made them wet
....that guy was a real asshole
what the hell
I bet everything in scifi can be related to something that exists or used to exist on earth by just taking away the 'space' aspect.
...the hell was hat?
i didnt have this ominoues camera drie in my game
And Ya'll are watching a stream....
Where da Krogan women at?
fuck you, my dog lives longer than YOU guys
i like having dickshep back in action
The reaction images for the trend are hilarious
dicksheps back in the game
There's even a MLP one
Spell-of-Lurking: i heard beliebrs. what is it you other guys are discussing ?
Afk.
You should have taken Liara. for what reason, i'll keep to my self.
Sumica: keep some room for the krogan knife shotgun
that sounds awesome
it'S like a shotgun... but instead of buckshot, it shoots serrated knives.i fucking loved that one
Dark_Horst, I'm talking about Beliebers trending "Boyfriend Video Made Us Wet" on Twitter
....do i even want to know?
It's freaking hilarious
tell me more then
Oy, Beliebers are a pain in the neck, and scary when pissed off as a group.
Here's the gallery of reaction pictures: https://twitter.com/#!/search/%22Boyfriend%20Video%20Made%20Us%20Wet%22/grid/photos
Noir: teargas. tazers. cattle prods. solved

Hello Invi.

I didn't know Raven was still popular
Noir: true that
RainbowcrashNBurn: ME3
RainbowcrashNburn: nope, ME3.
i was thrown off by the scars, renegade scars have disappeared since i transferred to ME3 :S
That is why i suggested Liara.
why restart
hooow come`?
lol
Will we see?
i think we will see
RainbowcrashNBurn: they come back with the renegade points
Sumica: why have my renegade scars dissappeared since ME 2?
wait what happened?
...
cheese
That is all.
cheese...
do I hear cheese o.o
ah ok, makes sence i guess was a bit confusing when i saw shepard with clean face even though he never took the treatment

Fattonie, true....
:$
Its cool.
I just need to play a game or something.
what? salarians showing backbone and solidarity for their allies? holy SHIT
All dem salarians look alike.
Why do i feal like that bit was forshadowing.
Twi_Fi: i can tell them apart. can't you?

Invi: yep. salarians have the average lifespan of dogs
lol
Ha ha. Mordin.
Mordin is boss.
oh waut... mordin is 50... no idea where i got the 21 from

Every one lives on my first play through. only Mordin died on my 2nd play through.
i had all loyalty missions :(
-_- work in 1 hour, and still got some people passed out drunk...dadgummit :| I can't leave here with these idiots in my house

On both play throughs i gotten all of loyalty and ship upgrades.
Cypresswolf, drunk tanks are your friend.

I dont know these people, my brother and/or roomate invited them over...I leaning on draggin their butts out on the front porch
for example, i sent legion into that pipe
i figured whod withstand heat betteer than a synthetic?
Cypresswolf, where is your brother and roomate now?

I didn't.

Any news of a Bluray set by any chance?
/me might have to look into that
oy vey
you know that a game has an mazingly awesome and interesting story when you can spend 3 hours just watching someone else playing it
nope and this is just an assumption but i wouldnt hold your breath for it
nah dvd
I seriously doubt they'll invest in a blu-ray set any time soon
^
friday movie night is near!
digital releases are cheaper for them anyway
oy vey
boy, he mad
Good thing he didnt name her lillith.
god dang now what!
Who does he plan to romance?
garrus
Hmmmm, if you dont romance tali on ME2 or ME3, Tali and garus would hook up before the end.
I was just letting the others know.
How sad for Garrus.

Monfang: piratism does NOT hurt companies. it's NOT stealing from them
And you base that on?
I payed for my copy of ME2, and ME3.
there's a huge difference between filesharing and stealing
its not giving tem anything either
Like?
people finally need to learn that
I'm asking you to explain it.
stealing implies that you take fromsomeone something they own by force
How does not paying for something that costs someone else to make not mean stealing?
^
g'morning all
Actually.. no.
same goes for music
Litwick, welcome.
the software pirates share as been bought at some pint
hi Litwick
HELLO Litwick.
bai! gotta get goin for school then get ready for friday movie night!
Can you rewrite that to make sense Dark?
bye EpicPwnTime2
now tell me... if i had bought a game from my own money, is it not mine? do i not have the rigth to give it so someone i know without charging him?
its not theft in the traditional sense of a physical product being taken but by filesharing instead of paying you are effectively robbing a company of a sale so you might as well of takewn it from the shop[
see ya at friday NIIIIIGHT!!!!!
Bye EpicPwnTime2.
No, you don't have that right.
!Pokemon
and that is incorrect
c ya epic... gone
piratism is not stealing
If I bought a book that you wrote and printed, and I reprented it and gave it away, would it not be stealing?
Wrong media.
I would be taking away potental business
It's the same thing.
its similar
I don't think so.
0.o
Then prove your possition
I'm scared
Books.
Data.
Oh, simple enough.
Ebooks
Fuck it. Im in no mood for arhuments
then don't speak up.
piratism is not stealing. it does not lower the fortune of the company, it takes nothing out of their porperty. it does not lead to profit for any other aprties
Dark_Horst it does lower the fortune of the parent company
Don't go starting arguments. How bout that?
as they do not get the money from the sale
ok this is an extreme example. if only 1 person bought me1 and the rest fileshared, do you think me2 or 3 would be made? no that would make terrible financial sense
You are taking away profit from them by proving a free source for a product that costs them money to produce?
however its not stealing because it doesnt remove the original
what is this for video?
its liscence fee dodging
Chrysalis: no. it lowers the potential number of people who might decide to give them money
Thus, cutting into their market and costing them money.
and look at the number of people buying it
its on the same level as people avoiding the tv license overall
and thats just a fine
Dark_Horst: As long as you buy the music/video/software after you pirated it, it doesn't hurt them.
the big companies make more money thn ever
what about the number of people who COULD have bought it?
Adn who actually does, Kandarihu?
Kandarihu|Mourning: wrong there
actually Kandarihu|Mourning has a point
I bought everything before i pirated it usually
monfang: their purchasing power doesn't magically rise by anti pirating measures.
:'(
It's love
purchasing power?
Look. Downloading it because you're interested in it and not buying the legal product DOES hurt them. Now, if the product turns out not to be worth the money, maybe they do deserve to take a hit.
Derpy, what are you talking about?
what you just said, kandahiru, implies that my money actually belongs to them. onyl that way it could hurt them if i didnt give it to them
that my money belongs to them even before i aqquired the said software
it limits how much they spend on videogames. most of the pirates would not have bought it.
I never said that.
Dark, let me explain what happens when you actually buy a game.
i actually did that once. buy i gamei pirated
........
there are no clear studies if the free pr the pirates deliver outweighs the lost sales there
collect sea ponies
You pay for the paychecks of a lot of people
sword of the stars 1
The money goes to the publisher NOT the people who made the game
You pay for their businesses to run and for people to feed their familes.
your not taking money away from the people who made it
just from the people who paid them to
it was a nice game, and then the collection with addons showed up on steam with a reasonable price. so i bought it
If you pirate a game, you are taking away the chance for money to reach those people.
didntregret it
I don't care if you regret it or not, you are still stealing.
It is theft plain and simple.
its license fee avoidance not stealing
but when i pre-ordered sword of the stars two i got panfully reminded why i picked up piracy in the first place
theft REMOVES the original
What do you think those fees go to? It pays for business expences like PAYCHECKS!
becasue everyone who did pay for it got assraped by the company
thoroughly
It's easyer to buy than to pirate and crack.
Monfang no it doesnt, the money you pay for a game doesnt reach the people who made it for making the game
even now, haöf a year after its release, its still unplayble
Ferenghi rule of Aquisition #11: Anything stolen is pure profit :P
So then you work within the industry then, Chrysalis?
it gets to them after they are paid to make another one
Because I do.
Monfang yes
those are 40 buck the company stoly from me
that's what I meant
I've seen teh books
publishers get the money, not the devs
And that money goes down the line to the Devs
but not for making the game
actually stole becasue they took part of my fortune without any balance
Do you think Developers just print their own paycheck money?
for making another
Someone is paying for them.
and that is why i pirate
Pirating the game and then buying it if you like it is, imho, the best way to go. Just the knowledge that these people (be it a few people or a huge development staff) worked on something that turned out well, buying the legal product should be an honor.
The publishers fund the devs, you cant get every game development started through kick starter.
Kandarihu, I ask again. Who actually does that?
This way, it's voting iwith your wallet.
Nya
14hi
and i like to make this clear: i am not defending myself here. i'm explaining why i stopped bying overpriced things from already too powerfull industries
so publishers make money and then pay the devs. But taking away the revenue to the publishers, you take it away from the devs
Beep boop buck the Nexus.
By stealing it.
Monfang: that is quite the bullshit
Ya, that makes a lot of sense.
Monfang: there are people who do that. I certainly can't name names. But occassionally, I see comments in Torrentfreak from people who proudly proclaim that practice.
Vocal Minority, Kandarihu
I am certainly not stealing anything. I am pirating it.
the argument tat piracy hurts ANYONE is a lie told by the ones who want your money
The scilent majority won't waste their time paying for something they get for free.
O________O
i think it would be naive to say that piracy hasn't affected pc gaming
It's not like I would have bought it if I couldn't pirate it, anyway.
Oy
Can you prove that, Dark?
Run, Resonantwaves_.
there is plenty proof
Then show it!
/me runs the opposite direction
Enough of a proportion of people that they can feel free to blast the people who leech everything without even bothering to buy the legal product.
xp
take ea for example. they keep growing and growing while ea games are the most pirated games on the net
I pirated ME3. I don't really think EA gives a damn.
nobody hurts them
14school is such a mess -w-
Because they have a strong concole business!
14glad to be home now
on the contrary
14how is everyone?
yeah they do, they are money hungry bastards
They mgiht deside one day just to drop PC all together
Now, I would actually have bought ME3, but then I'd have to pay EA.
It's hard enough already to get good PC ports of anything
dd3 shock Bucking horror they are a company of course they are
even thoush EA was put as the worst company of the year lol
every company ever is the exact same
EA gets most of it's money from sports titles on the Concoles
i remember when pc ported to console, not the other way around -_-
^
Monfang: you do realize tat console games can be pirated JUST as well?
Not really, no.
yes really
I have a ginormous stack of pirated PS games.
The codes are a lot harder to break.
i must know, i AM a pirate
Yarr.
No, you are a thief
indeed
Monfang no their not
YOU ARE A PIRATE! YAR HAR
I am certainly not stealing anything. I am pirating it.
I honestly don't think there's a gaming audience that's any more casual than people who only play sports games on consoles.
lol
its just as easy to pirate a console game as a PC game
I perfer ninjas
Stop dressing up yourself like you are some kinda hero working against the evil Gaming Industry.
its just harder to get the console to accept them, which is a one time thing
You are a thief plain and simple.
for every major game i looked up in the last year there were verisons for ps and xbox available to
pirating (verb): Use or reproduce (another's work) for profit without permission, usually in contravention of patent or copyright.
for pirating
Minjas!! :P they throw Surikens and then ride on them
stealing (verb): ake (another pony's property) without permission or legal right and without intending to return it: "thieves stole her bicycle".
Take*
Monfang: no sir. you are just brainwashed. either that or dense
You thieving pirates!
Do you have a legal right to pick up a game from a brick and morder business and walk out with it?
Without paying for it?
Mon, thats stealing the disk
that is not pirating
thats different, that hurts the game store
This whole conversation is moot, really. It's not like anypony will change anypony else's mind.
that is stealing
not piracy
Do you have the legal right to copy the disk to a fresh one you have right in the store?
Monfang: Imagine somepony steals your car, but it's still there in the morning.
Monfang: please try to open your mind. Piracy is a natural right. And it carries a responsibility with it, that many pirates actually fufill. And as long as more pirates fufill that responsibility, piracy will cease to be a problem.
Then it's still stealing, Kammer
becasue that copy is an accoundet object, pressed on a physical medium which has a rescource wirth
NATURAL RIGHT?!
I dont pirate, becuase my conchance would mentaly kick my own flank.
00,10do you own the hub Monfang?
This chat makes me LOL.
Me too.
Oh right. This entire site is basically a pirating hub.
It's not like I own anything I watch here.
00,10bingo
/me is bored in class -_-;;
What are you talking about?
Kammerjunk i usually end up buying stuff BECAUSE i watch it here
^
14lol
We ARE pirating MLP on this site. Because the HUB is a premium cable chanel.
if you have ever streamed an ep you are 'steraling'
I'm not.
Chrysalis: And I end up buying games if I like them.
I got the Hub
Channel 100
did anyone hear Sweetie Bot in the new Hub promo?
I watch it all the time
00,10You watch Fim here with out paying for the hub network
14I had two hours of Law today x3
/me feal like watching Death to Smoochy.
I pay for the privlage to watch FIM
Heh, i usually end up pirating games if i like them, becuase i hate the DRM that comes with them
what you do ot understand is that pressed exemplaries out of company mills are their property. it is part of the companies fortune. you take it, they dont have it anymore. data is virtual. copied data is not acciunted in their property. if you download cpied data, it is not soemthing the corp owns
seals*
Sumica: Monfang is paying for it.
I don't watch FIM here.
feals*
pirates get a better experience alot of the time
Then there's the matter of BMN.
Because I like the show, I pay for it.
you takecopied data, they still have just as much as before
i don't get the hub through my cable provider, so, pirate all the ponies!
00,10well good for you, how about any thing else we show here?
I have a massive pile of unopened blu-rays that i bought and downloaded theonline rip so avoid the damn adverts
Like what?
Just started
@Dark
I don't watch the streams usually.
14aw :(
i get Monfang's point, if no one pays for games, the industry has no incentive to make games since there is no profit
I watched Legend of Koora only after I saw it on Nick.
00,10ok so you just hop on your high horse then and start shit for the hell of it?
d3rb: but that will never bee the case
the amount of piracy will never surpass the amount of sold goods
No, I spoke up against theft because it is wrong.
Dark_Horst: I'm not saying that piracy is like stealing. But it's like not paying for someone's job.
its not impossible but unlikely
d3rb: But that's assuming no pirates buy games they like. Being a pirate doesn't make you an ass.
thats true
You're making the common mistake of confusing piracy with theft.
I perfer situational pirateing, IE down loading games and media that is not legaly offered in the contry that the person lives in.
this chair be high, sez I
And what is the difference, Kandarihu?
yeah, i buy every single game i like, but pirate games i would never buy
i have pirated games and music but i also have a stupid amount of music cd's and bought games
Can't be arsed to copypaste the definitions of pirating and stealing again.
How is using a product without paying for it not theft?
plus i buy games i pirate if i end up liking it
some music i would not have found if not for piracy
I think there are three definitions of piracy in this chat.
What most everyone is saying. Do I have to say what everyone's been trying to tell you?
SirGanjalf: wit all due respect, the companies i pirate from have lost every right for my trust or my money after all the shit they threw at their customers head over the years
^
So then you steal from them?
they treat their paying customers like shit
no. i dont steal
No, I pirate from them.
Did you use a product without paying for it?
if that dfference between theft and piracy does jot go into your head, you should stop partaking in this discussion
I use or reproduce their work without permission, usually in contravention of patent or copyright.
Such a question does not belong into a public chatroom, Monfang
stealing isnt the correct term, copywrite infrigment is (i think)
Then you stole, Kammer
14http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2600
its not stealing
Pirating is somewhat fun as long as you are downloading something that is old and has little or no monetary value... Don't go to tpb and download Windows 7 or something like that...
stealing REMOVES THE ORIGINAL
I didn't take their property, I reproduced it.
There is a difference.
Main chat is sooooo intense!
and pirating removes NOTHING
Dark_Horst: Then JUST don't buy their games. Playing in them while hating company responsible for them is a bit schizophrenical isn't it?
Except for money from hard working people's wallets
Ok, how about we stop talking about privacy and say we did?
00,10incorect
*piracy
How so?
00,10if he would not have bought it to start with then the mony is not lost
Oh no.
Piracy-sophistry?
Yeah...
If he had went the legal route and bought the game, they would have gotten the money.
Welcome to an argument.
monfacng, answer me this: just becasue the company has the HYPTHETICAL CHANCE to aquire a sum of money, does that money belong to them already?
hi Lasharus
00,10corect but that is asuming he would have bought it
I think I'll pass, I've just seen the dumbest argument of the day come by.
War time dicount my flank!
Monfang: You prefer to buy your stuff up front, right? You see trailers and read reviews and base your entire buying decision on that, right?
yay, another copyright theft / piracy flamewar ! \o/
Taht's a strawman, Dark.
Cya Lasharus
discount*
"I wouldn't have bought this food if I couldn't steal it"
Specifically THAT argument.
Lasharus: Could be worse. Could be an argument about religion. Those never end.
Monfang: it's not. it'S the core of the discussion
What if the game wasn't made though a publisher?
Uakh: it's an argument, I don't see a lot of flaming here.
Oh, I would never pirate from indie developers.
Shit, I just realized I forgot about the game because of this chat!
That's just mean.
EDI is best AI.
How is taht mean and not th eother?
Allo everypony.
What is the difference?
Meanwhile, HELLO!
welp this isnt gonna end anytime soon and i got to get my rave on for friday night. later everypony
Allo Meanwhile
Monfang: doesnt change jack
Cya d3rb.
Oh?
Kandarihu|Mourning: there's a lot of potential here though. Everybody has strong opinions. It's only a matter of time before we can start handing godwin points.
i go too. C y'all later ^^
stealing REMOVES fortune. piracy does NOT
cya Invi
So then you'd pirate a game from someone who doesn't go though a publisher to get their game out?
Bye Invi.
c ya d3rb
HiHi
you can not steal from someone what they dont own yet
bye Invi
Because EA is a gigantic corporation. Indie developers don't sell as many copies.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEBbu-wkKrs
Cya Invi
It can be argued that piracy steals the potential for fortune.
So then it's ok to steal from walmart and not the mom and pop stores.
michael: hey there
Kammerjunk: BTW: http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/117071-Notch-Dumps-on-EA-Indie-Bundle
Uakh: well, let's not pass such judgment on all of us until/unless it reaches that threshold.
/me is bored
So we're discussing the ethics of piracy?
I still disagree that I'm stealing it.
/me hugs d3rb Meanwhile SirGanjalf Ninjazz|SPAZ and Sumica for streaming
Hmmm. Meanwhile walked in.
bye Invi
Yes. Yes I did.
/me shrugs
:)
This entire argument is moot, anyway. Nopony is ever going to change anypony's opinion.
bya Mutterguy
Piracy also ruins the trust developers have for PC gamers and they are just as likely to not make PC games anymore.
sidenote. the game i told ypu about earlier? the one i bought? it was an indie corp. a small one. i thought hey these guys look promising, lets pay them
Chat moving to fast to notive EVERYPONY
Meanwhile, discusssing whether piracy and actual theft are one in the same.
notice*
Monfang: You prefer to buy your stuff up front, right? You see trailers and read reviews and base your entire buying decision on that, right?
I rent first and then buy
half a year later i got rewardet for that thrust by being blatantly ripped off
Kammerjunk: I totally agree... The piracy issue is totally a moot point. Nopony is going to change anypony's mind on this issue, no matter what is being said.
Like how you can test drive a car.
Well, I guess that's a good way to go.
Dark, I don't care.
But if don't like the game, you wouldn't buy it. If I don't like the game I pirate, I wouldn't buy it.
Piracy is one of the thous big issues that would be more and more important as we get closer to "the cloud."
hey back all
Having one bad experience is no excuse.
Shane377, run.
Monfang: Do you use a game rental service?
Ninjazz|SPAZ: why?
Yes.
Hey Shane377.
Don't ask. Just run.
Sumica: who hates gamestop?
Monfang: itÄs not that you do not care. you're locking up against any arguemnt that could prove you wrong by refusing to accept simple definitons and facts
Because all the arguments are weak at best.
Basically, if you buy used copies and do rentals, you are hurting company profits.
Shame377: I DO!!! Worst customer service, and doesn't carry the games I want for my PS3.
That's how internet arguments work.
I'd say that buying a used game directly for someone is OK. Gamestop etc. on the other hand...
'I got burned once so why should I pay for anything.'
*from
14!shipping
'I pay for it later, I promise.'
lol
14ohh right x3
I pirate stuff that's not available in my country, like all tv shows with original voices (not the dubs). I used to pirate games before I discovered Steam because I felt ripped off too many times. Steam has honest prices most of the time. It's more a matter of convenience than anything else. If they was a decetly priced way to get poneis with original VA I'd get it.
Sumica: if they h8 gamestop who da buck else is gonna sell their games
Dark_Horst: this is something a lot of people have trouble with. It's a common problem.
gamestop is a good example. because other than pirates, they actually earn fortune with someone elses work without giving them anything
Uakh: I totally agree
them fat cats
The game companys are not worryed about the Japanes market seens ther are laws ageanst used software and hardware
Well the objective of buisness is profit, that's why it exists.
pirates utilise something they didnt create. gamestop profits of something they didnt create
/me also miises the days of big manuals
why dont you hate on gamesto for a while and call them thieves?
You want me to hate on retailers?
I hate this conversation.
I hate vans.
I hate life.
Lets go on to Walmart and Winn-Dixie then.
i hate feets
And doctors and lawyers and cops
Lets hate on them too
Hey QT_Marks
Because they don't produce anything, they jsut BUY things and then RESELL them.
eaburdick3: hey, lol just refreshed my chat though
and tha gains them profit
See Dark. Retailers work because they BUY a product at a low price and resell it at a higher price.
civ 2 manual was something liek 200 pages and had a whole bunch of hisotry included.
Buying things in bulk is cheaper than buying them individually.
Because Retailers are better at selling than producers most often.
Piracy is an issue that isnt just black and white, but meny shades of gray as well.
Sumica: so what about if they discontinue the line of the game but u want that game ??
Looks pretty black and white to me.
Noir: How fitting to your name. But everything is shades of grey.
/me sits on Viri's head
not only does gamestop take physical copies from corporations without giving them anything, they actually profit of that. by your argumentation, that's actual stealing
02hai :3
The thing is, we're blasting Gamestop for something Monfang doesn't really understand.
Stealing is Stealing, theft is theft and pirating is just wrong.
Buying used is better than piracy
Everything is a shade of grey.
14eep! Hi :P
14did you beat something? :D
this guy is a fanatic
Dark, are you accusing Gamestop of going to comapnies like Nintendo and stealing truckloads of games?
thats fun Monfang, im a pirate, yar har...
so much piracy arguing
14on Touhou I mean
when you buy used, the company that makes zero money off of it
Mane chat fails right now.
yes. becasue they optain the copies the companies created without giving the companies a SINGLE cent for them
Sumica: whats ur opinon on online passes Sumica but dont they still get some amount of money from used copies
Well all, be back in a bit... Need a shower for work... ttyl :)
I'm drowning in chat.
Because the product has already been payed for, QT
The currents are too much for me.
The comapnies have gotten the money they need to break even and then some
i worked at a gamestop and they tell you that if you want to open a new game and take it home for the first night go ahead, then we had a used copy to sell
Yes, but buying used means the company has lost a sail.
After that, it's free range so long as it remains uncopied.
sale*
Your company has sunk.
You sunk my battleship.
Monfang: appearantly, you do not grasp the concept of data and matter
And that was company policy, QT?
u get a code if u dont have the code for online/ mp u get no online privileges <----- isnt that how most "online passes" are?
Sumica: ^^
from the managers mouth
yeah, i backed out when i realised how inflexible everyone was being with differing opinions
it does sumica
But is it company policy?
It's nice when this kind of stuff is only relegated to entertainment isn't it. Imagine how messed up this'd be if you could download the cure for the common cold.
not even a fun argument if all they do is repeat the same points
As in is it in the mission statement that you can just pop open a new game and take it home?
company wide, no, buy by branch, yes
Sumica: its really only in my experience EA who have the online passes cause their dicks
Then it's a branch problem. Not a problem Gamestop has.
but** by branch
quite
I have nuthing ageanst some one pirating a game that he/she wouldn't be abble to buy in the contry. (Such as the goverment banning said game by denying the game a rateing. or the company not porting game to your contry.) But i dont care for pirating a game that can be easly found and purchased by legal means.
Because I doubt all the branches think the same way, QT
Sumica: back then when u were getting chased what happens if they catch u?
You die.
It's funny, chat was so dead earlier and now.....
It just goes to a game over screen
LOL
And then god smacks you for asking questions with obvious answers.
Shane377: game over, just that. no cutscene, no anthying
Nothing stirs up activity like an argument.
14brb
this isnt an argument
you get a fade to black
Don't pass GO, don't collect 200 dollars.
this is a broken record
so if the reaper ships get u but on palaven arent there reapers there?
Dat Monopoly.
Argument, debate, conflict, dribble, whatever you want to call it.
Meme
Yeah, the points are being rehashed again and again.
Is it over?
Do not pass go, do not collect two hundred pounds.
meh, an argument involves actual to-and-fro with points and counter points
nope, you have to convert 200 dollars to pounds
Sumica: if the reaper ship get u u die but what about back on palaven werent there reapers then?
That how it was, but then no one was convinced of the other's arguments sooo it became repetitious.
200 USD would be 123.716442 GBP.
Like I give a fuck.
But now it seems quieter.
It says 200 pound son the game board.
I thought the USD would be less at this point... *sighs*
so back then Sumica there was no scanning thing like now so the cutscene couldnt of happened ?

curse you mathematics why can't multiply be a consistant symbol, not context sensitive
Sumica: Perhaps if you spelled better...
i kno and iwas being siri Meanwhile
out of curiosity, how do you personally pronounce your name Sumica?
lol
Fuuuuuuuuu
okay, that's how I pronounce it, so I guess you don't butcher it too bad
almost didn't make it
And then everything went wrong.
Did Ditzy fall asleep while flying again?
So they can guard the secrets of alchemy.
ok, need sleep
Night Mutterguy.
bye all
bye
Night Mutterguy.
night Mutterguy
but why use 3 symbols for multiply, and use one of those for 3 different things
bai
He's terribly conservative with flamethrower ammo.
why not just have 1 symbol why meaning
Meanwhile: hows that bucking awesome mustache of urs
You mean where Alyx is a troll?
I personally thought the flamethrower sucked a lot.
I can't really remember in which episode that is.
Shane377: Moustachey.
Yeah, I didn't like the flamethrower.
Because math
lol
Pyro is my fav class though.
kill the with fire!
I love Aliens.
*
night Meanwhile, SirGanjalf, Twi_Fi, Teh
x
After Engi of course
That film is amazing.
Twi_Fi and .
and Shane377]
best chick-flick ever
Once you get to using variables I only ever see * used
Pyro is awesome. So flexible.
I can't wait for "Meet the Pyro"
which when small means multiply and larger means dot product
Aliens is a chick flick?
No innuendo.
How do you apply that logic?
()() ?
oh and no symbol also means multiply
http://shishioh-image.sakura.ne.jp/imege/SHF_OOO_BURAKAWANI_COMBO/7-12.jpg
so 4 ways of showing multiplication
god I wish I had money
ohai everypony
so I could get things like that
if you observe a lot of the themes going on in the movie, it can seem like a chick flick behind a badass sci-fi movie
Mass Effect?
Jim, welcome.
Yes.
Amazing.
neat
I don't like the helmet system in the game, so I just went into Coalesced and removed it permanently.
Yep, they are watching it for some weird reason
Hi Jim.
Fattonie: I guess I can kind of see that, if you interpret it as such. But frankly I'm content to leave as it's meant to be.
I know, it's mostly just a joke
boooo
Dat joke.

Not sure if "worst" or "worse"
Cya
Worse
Sorry, multi-thinking
Chrysalis, you buy pony toys! LOL
i wanted luna to be my first :(
Just kidding.
Chrysalis, :O
Well yeah of course there are worse way to die than asphyixation by dirt, but for a Krogan that has to suck extra hard.
not in that way you pervert
:D
well, i wouldnt say no, but that wasnt my intention in the statement
That'd be like a Klingon dying from choking on gak.

Hey Bacon
eaburdick3: knowyourmeme.com
Oh ok. I've been on there a few times, but its been a while
so i guess they are like the hulk
SirGanjalf: kind of like memebase.com... same thing except knowyourmeme explains them
ive been mic spamming this song - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkuSmJtRY8E - on COD Black Ops :D it was GRAND! :D
Hey what's shakin' Bacon[Hazard].
im kinda bored now though
earbudick3: Maybe, idk, i mostly get there through google anyway
Floating grenade is the answer.
SirGanjalf: cool. I'll have to check it out more later.

Da bugs.
You don't say.
so whats up with you guys?
They've got mutant gun barrels poking out of their sides.
Things happened.
Garrus, aka Captain Obvious.
What was that Sumica?
Ooooooh.
Ugly bastards....
Bacon[Hazard]: Not much has been going on here in an hour or so besides the discussion of game piracy, and some other random conversations I'm not involved in...
Ahem. Kill it with fire
Grunt is awesome.
have you ever been so mad that you threw a rachni?
Dark_Horst: This one time, at band camp...
Bacon[Hazard]: To be honest, I'm kind of lost at what they're all talking about. :-/
No, but I have been so mad I punched an Atlas to death.
:)
No need to recap.
Hey twilight_sprinkle
HEY twilight_sprinkle.
eaburdick3: o.o i just got in, hai :D
twilight_sprinkle, welcome.
Allo twilight_sprinkle.
Ninjazz: wasn't trying to recap it all, just trying to figure it out...
how u gaiz found me? Oo
twilight_sprinkle: Magic *snort snort*
grunt = badass
Sumica: it's the most entertaining way to kill Atlas.
Jim: oh ok :3
twilight_sprinkle: very easily...
Atlas's? Atlai?
What's the plural of Atlas.
suddenly you realise that you liek grunt a lot more than wrex since ME3
eaburdick3: nyees?
Jim: you took what I was gonna say... *hangs head in shame*
oh and yeah, hai gaiz :D
Atlas > Atlases
twilight_sprinkle: nothing, just agreeing with jim, thats all
Implied IS the past tense.
eaburdick3: :P
which reminds me, to to vore for dmn
So did Iron Man
Too bad Garrus didn't live through husk rape.
Use your medigel man!
ouch
Sumica: got no medigel?
twilight_sprinkle: I feel that this conversation is quickly becoming NSFW...
there. no you have two baits B)
He's mastered bait.
O U
eaburdick3: Oo i thought it ended
Meanwhile: i c wat u did thar
Meanwhile, that\s just no.
twilight_sprinkle: I'm not sure yet... I'm not even sure wtf is going on yet... Just woke up a few mins ago and still tired :O
*yawna*
*yawns*
KUUGA!　Revive yourself with burning blood
eaburdick3: yawna :D
For TUCHANKA!
Wake the hell up, eaburdick3!
KUUGA! Energy made of pride
twilight_sparkle: Unfortunately, when typing on an iPad with a keyboard, spellcheck doesn't work...
Twi_Fi: I am awake... partially
KUUGA! To be strong and powerful!
Yawna is best pony.
i just got back from my morning physics class(i hate morning classes) im tired too, i also stayed up late watching code geass stream
NO FEAR
NO PAIN
eaburdick3: ah, and no tab button either i guess
KAMEN RIDER KUUGA!
eaburdick3, okay then. It's best to be awake while in chat. You never know what could be posted.
<_<
>_>
twilight_sprinkle: Well, the keyboard has a tab button on it, but doesn't work here...
thats what she said
So who's up for some pom?
Twi_Fi: I agree
You didn't read that sentence correctly.
>_>
eaburdick3: typing names sure is a pain
Meanwhile, O U.
i wonder if you actually get it
No, I read it perfectly fine
This is the song that never ends...
Well you're just a spoilsport.
it just goes on and on my friends
Go pop small childrens footballs.
Meanwhile: whos up for some pomf?
i still have you muted on my xbox
;_;
Dohoho.
:3
twilight_sprinkle: Would you believe I was k:line'd from this chat almost 5 times by accident around 1:00am EST?
Meanwhile: i saw pom :P
You see too much pom.
if only we could play with friendly fire
i would end you
eaburdick3: lol, thjats weird
/me pom
:3
Some porn was already posted earlier.
:O
Oo
But very few commented on it.
twilight_sprinkle: I let my friends that were over play a game on my ipad while i went into the other room, and when i came back, they had been harassing ValTheJean and kirzstryfe to no end, and had my network banned several times
>_>
we are talking about pom not porn
>_>
eaburdick3: o that lol, the "admin" guys
eaburdick3: that was quite entertaining to watch:P
twilight_sprinkle: what did he say :D
twilight_sparkle: Yes, unfortunately, that was my machine they were using so I got blamed for it, but was smart enough to write an email to the admins and explain it, and now here I am
Woah
HOLY SHIT
twilight_sprinkle: I guess they lifted it, cause I'm connectd again
Bacon[Hazard]: well as i understand it was his friends, not him, they were just trolling the mods and avoiding all bans :D
twilight_sprinkle: no WHAT did he say?
Well, they figured out what proxies were and managed to get banned like 8 times for 1 hour, then got k:line'd like 10 more
would be nice to actually play with friednly fire though
:O
Bacon[Hazard]: yesterday you mean?
Sumica: You're gonna kill it right?
get to shoot that annoying person who always walks in front as im about to take my shot
yes
Bacon[Hazard]: Nothing... Havent even got a reply from the admins yet, I guess they just forgave me cause I'm on now
matches with randoms would be impossible
and throw kenne out the map if he does punchy punchy
eaburdick3: day was some epic evasion :P
most certainly
*dat
but thats why they are called CUSTOM games
Bacon[Hazard]: nothing bad, just some harmless mod trolling like "you thought you could get rid off me lol"
and they'd have to make it so player's are affected by biotics in some way without it breaking the physics engine
i have her on my carpenting crew. what will you do? B)
twilight_sparkle: Yeah, I saw the conversation history on my laptop a few minutes after they got k:line'd for the 6th time.. kept kicking my laptop off, so I walked into the other room and saw the conversation history
Bacon[Hazard]: altho they were kinda pushing it by the end, i dont rememer what they were saying
how far into the game is this?
twilight_sprinkle: Let's just say, they're not coming over, or touching my ipad or laptop EVER again
twilight_sprinkle: lol
YES!
WALK AWAY
NOOOO
YOU FOOL
that sounds like it was awesome :D
BUCK YES!
LOLOLOLOLOLOL
You've doomed us all!
Meanwhile: calm your jimmies. they make for good carpenters
Destroyed us all!
You've clearly never released the surrogate before.
eaburdick3: yep, thats friends for ya. you let one over, he sets some crap on your status in a site like fb
no grunt
Oh no.
players are FAR heavier than the Ai
don't do this
i didnt know shepard was a robot
twilight_sprinkle: Well, fortunately, that was closed, and password protected on my ipad, so they're not getting on that ***EVER***
Grunt, noooooooo....
well, he CAN survive the fight. i just dont know what the requirements are yet
I am KROGAAAAAN.
is ME3 almost over?
i saw a video on youtube where he made it to the shuttle
twilight_sparkle: Well, going to get some breakfast, so ttyl.
He can lose this fight?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOo
bye eaburdick3
*snif* why
My playthrough had him come through just fine.
Bye eaburdick3.
yay
just like Lord of the Rings :D YOU SHALL NOT PASSSS!
Like that.
Huzzah!
Cya eaburdick3
Bloody.
Bloody hell
Yay!
:D
Meanwhile: well a krogan can loose the fight. since i played defailt shep, there was no wrex but a noname krogan on the normandy and a noname krogrna that lead aralak company. that noname dude died
Dark_Horst: lose*
asppearently, grunt doesnt thing so highly of dying and refuses to do so
Just think, the game already gets incredibly messed up when you die while biotic charging, think of how it would react to a pull or singularity affecting a player, especially if they die from an explosion while affected by such
thought it was over for him...... guess this shepard had loyality with grunt
Meanwhile: you forgot *default
Dark_Horst: I figured you'd realise that one.
uhuh
I never had Mordin in my first playthrough :/
XD
all the broken physics :D
hm... i had... with default... di yours die?
Yeah mine died in the collector base.
I like Mordin.
Inb4 a gun that shoots thresher maws.
Thanks to the 3 ponies who actually said bye when I left for like 10 seconds...
Makes me feel good...
put on the glasses anderson
*jk*
go on tuchanka. people here MUST see that certain one incredibly epic cutscene
twilight_sparkle: Left, got cereal, came back, only 3 of 100 people said bye... wtf
twilight_sparkle: I don't want to live on this planet anymore...
I said bye, eaburdick3!
that was longer than 10 secs!
I know i know... just kidding
Twi_Fi: i think he being sarcastic
THAT'S the spirit :D
14Lighty :3
Chat always says there is about 90 ponies on here, but most appear to be sleeping.
06Viri :3
Twi_Fi: was being sarcastic... just thought it was funny that you, Ninjazz, and twilight_sprinkle was the only ones to say anything out of 90-100 ponies on this channel... ftw
/me hugs Lighty
14how are you? ^^
Ponies, why you no talk >_>
:)
Pone
D:
Twi_Fi: I was wondering that myself...
there's always only like a 20% participation rate
-_-
twilight_sprinkle: good point
http://mlfw.info/f/1356/ :)
90% of the chat is lurking.
Fattonie: that makes this channel 20% cooler
Except during movie night
In which case this chat is doomed.
Oh GAWD! THE STREAM! OMGWTFEVULL!
And if it's muted, the side channels are doomed.
http://fav.me/d3khkb5
gah, i still havnet voted
:D
06good~
/me hugs Viri
14:3
06:3c

/me flees
Teh: I have that picture... That pretty much sums up Rainbow Dash to anypony whom hasn't seen the show yet...
14hi :D
Hiya :p
02<Viri> did you beat something? :D <- LOL LATE
02But nope
02:<
chat has been sleepy this week
00,10yeah no. I need to strech a bit. My arse is asleep
Teh: To fellow bronies like the people on here, that pic is a poster describing what potheads think of Rainbow dash
00,10gonna put on some shows
14:(
eaburdick3: haha
stretch that ass
Yeah Sumica, stretch that ass... *nohomo*
hey sumica when are you going to play sins again?
ALL the homo!
^
^^^ NO
RAY MAH BOI
vvv
Why we no talk no mo
A-yeeeeeesss.
02Silbah :3
02Silvah*
02And I dunno, lol
00,10remind me again, why did we un ban you =p
02We should :V
Uh oh
pardon
Unban who?
eaburdick3
Probably
he shared his story just a few mins earlier o.o
Sumica: because I'm a nice guy and what was said this morning around 1:00am wasn't me typing obviously...
Youve missed my show last week
The OPPOSITE DAY SHOW
It was a changeling!
00,10oh it's you.
well maybe 10 mins
Sumica: You can tell it wasn't be cause my username matches the email I sent the staff
00,10heh yeah no one unbaned you.
lol
rofl.
well hes here, and lets keep it that way :)
Well not anymore
Actually he's gone.
lol
oh, not banned again?:(
He just got hammered into the next dimension.
Eeyup.
Anyway i have to go to my next class shortly
http://www.newsoxy.com/odd/australia-fight-samurai-sword-chainsaw-69482.html
:\
/me cries.
now im kinda sad
I'm indifferent.
00,10dont cry Twi_Fi
meh
00,10it was the guy going around as Admin last night
Sumica: he sais it wasnt him, it was his friends
14ok
00,10quite foalish to cal ones self out
00,10and yeah i have never heard that one before
exactly
why would he di\o it
*do it
if he were lying
Why do any of them do it?
Bbl
So many ponies......gone.......
if he were lying he wouldnt call hmself out
so he has a party, gets pissed off because someone says his music is too lound and grabs a chainsaw
00,10and yeah we have can see alot more information with the help of ponys like Makerdusk
i have no sympathy
actually, it seems the neighbors attacked for the music being too loud
00,10it was useing of proxies and other things that one cant just wip up on the fly
Unless he were making a clever ploy to make himself look innocent by calling himself out.
Troy Thornton, 26, hosted a party at his sisters hom
29-year-old Mark Jorgensen, complained that the music was too loud.
00,10any who
Sumica: i just thought, how did the reapers appear in ME3? i thought they were stuck in deep space, and the collectors were just trying to make a new reaper
unless I mixed the names up while reading
Meanwhile: possible, but hes not doing anything
Troy Thornton decided to grab a chainsaw
00,10evading is evading
Meanwhile in Australia....
Meanwhile: he said that he locked his ipad, so it shouldnt happen again
Members of the Thornton family claimed that a person from the Jorgensen home threatened them by driving a car erratically at them.
Jorgensen cut one of Thorntons fingers off with a samurai sword for stepping in.
yes Sumica and chairs are chairs..
Thornton struck Jorgensen in the arm with the chainsaw severing it to the point he may lose it.
Tell someone who cares sprinkle. Because I don't.
Twi_Fi in the legion of doom.
Meanwhile: youre a heartless mario.
00,10If you cant wait for a responce and just come back in what is the point of it?
Yup. I'm ok with it.
Police were called out to both homes to separate the families. The police asked everyone to go back into their own homes.Several hours later, the feud started right back up after someone from the Jorgensen household tried to break into the Thornton home.
/me cries some more.
What shows were you going to put on Sumica?
presumably to turn the music down
Yes. A good question.
wow
so it seem there was a fight over the music, then the police came and broke it up
what response
then the neighbors tried to break in
The response to his ban appeal.
the ones breaking in brought bats and swords
Okay....*sniff*.... I think I'm done....*sniff* ....crying.
00,10he sent in the ban appeal like 2 hours ago
he thought he was unbanned
Dr. Horrible FTW.
Dr. Adorable i see.
swords are a bit much
the one who had the party had the guy with the chainsaw after swords were already hout
out*
but not warranting of a damn chainsaw
Dr. Adorable is best doctor.
00,10nope he was using a proxy to bypass the ban
roy Thornton decided to grab a chainsaw after Mark Jorgensen and several other men started arguing with his mother and two sisters.
To be fair, what is he gonna do against swords, fight bare fisted?
I though Admin was cow334?
he grabbed it before any violence occured
what if this isnt his proxy and every other ip from him was
because of an argument
*thought
the line right before that: “Basically we ended up all in a brawl,” said Thornton’s sister, Nicole Thornton. “The guys from next door. By then there was 20 of them with bats, swords and poles.”
twilight_sprinkle why do you care so much.
guys im making a fiction about the Mane Six getting teleported into different times in human history. what Era should Rainbow Dash go to?
Bacon[Hazard]: Modern.
Twilights going to modern
<3
Hmmm.
oh... extended?
Meanwhile: why not.
all that had to be done to avoid all of that was to turn the music down
twilight_sprinkle: way to avoid coming up with a decent reason.
I'm sure you've already thought about future.
Lesson: TURN YOUR BUCKING MUSIC DOWN!
it sounds like they have more problems than just the music, it was just an excuse for the feud to start
nope
Approves song o.o
Hai everypony
Ponies be crazy.
Future then?:S
the future is too flexible... Modern and down
Airpuff, welcome.
:/
Allo Airpuff.
HELLO Airpuff.
x)
Wait.
Meanwhile: lol
You aren't secretly a troll, right, Airpuff?
Meanwhile: that was a combined billion reasons
Awww Yeah!
if it was just the music, then breaking in and bringing swords is a rediculous response.
Twi_Fi what? =S
Meanwhile: basically youre asking "why be nice"
Dat Rarity!
twilight_sprinkle: No, that was a rephrasing of the question "why"
Bacon[Hazard], no Twi in the Renaissance?
^
if my neighbour wouldnt turn down the music even after the police got involved
Rarity gets plopped down in France
Or rather, a counter question in exact opposites.
Paris to be exact
id proabbly break in to trash the damn thing
she will fit right in
Wow
Why are routers such silly fillies?
Airpuff, I don't know who to trust anymore!
Meanwhile: ok heres a list: its the right thing to do; i want to help him because i believe him; i believe in guilt until proven otherwise; i dont think he was doing bad things; no harm was done; i want this place to be hate-free
As for why not, because you won't change anything the mods decide and eventually just work yourself up until you do something daft and get yourself kicked to the moon.
You just call the cops again. Breaking in gets you in trouble.
wouldnt take a sword
trust zoidberg
all i need is Rainbow Dash... WAIT!
i have no faith in the cops
Twi_Fi... Hmpf.. How come?
ANCIENT GREECE!!!!
Meanwhile: *in not guilt until proven
Just because hes been brought up a few times, why did cow344 get banned?
Plus, you could be wrong. As such, best to leave it to the folks who can actually check on those things.
Meanwhile: read what i last said:i believe in guilty until proven otherwise
The cops love a chance to push someone around for not doing much.
damn it,*not guilt until
What you believe is irrelevant.
Giant hat
FUCK YES
Meanwhile: lol no.
Ooh song playlist
Meanwhile: it is relevant to my behavior
yay
wat... xDD
Oh this song <3
Meanwhile: i have standards/morals which i follow
Lol, yes. You can believe whatever you want, it doesn't change the outcome of this whole debacle.
You break in and smash their music player, they can call the cops on you, and for quite a lot more.
but they wont actually do anything though
Meanwhile: it does, ill say what i think
Meanwhile: il lat least try
Your behaviour is also irrelevant.
Meanwhile: yeah lets all believe what we do is irrelevant
only if they have proof
In fact, you are irrelevant at the core of this.
whi's streaming?
just dont leave evidence its you
then its all coincidental
Yes, because you are the perfect cat burglar.
they can't arrest you on motive
Dark_Horst, Sumica.
This isn't about you yet, nor will it likely ever be.
Meanwhile: you do what you want, sit and do nothing, ill follow my standards, your standsards of "do nothing" do not satisfy me
Ninjazz: is it a good idea to put Pinkie Pie in ancient Israel?
Bacon[Hazard], WUT!
Your opinion is just as irrelevant as everything else you've said.
twilight_sprinkle: so you're arguing for the sake of arguing?
its my fanfic
Sumica: what's your upload rate right now?
Bacon[Hazard], oh, you can do what you want.
00,10600
Meanwhile: and no, things i say may have some effect, and you cant know otherwise
Rainbow road .... just got 20% more cooler
Fattonie: you havent read anything else i said, have you
as i said as well, i would only do this if the police didnt do anything
00,10why do you ask?
that might explain why i'm having trouble
My standards of "let the mods handle issues that are theirs to handle" is good enough for me, whether it's good enough for you is, as always, irrelevant.
Bacon[Hazard]: Why?...
Buck the police!
Fattonie: scroll up where i listed the reasons why i defended that guy in this case
00,10600 is normal for me
Bacon[Hazard]: Kinda random... I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING!
Ninjazz: idk
00,10actaly if you have been watching for many hours I recomend a refresh of the embed just to clear out any desync
Meanwhile: mods arent always right.
Implying you are?
yes i did
such hatred for police...
didnt change mucn though
00,10oh wait
Meanwhile: ...no? youre jsut arguing for the sake of it
right now t'S fine
00,10audio is out of sync is't it
Meanwhile: youre not even thinking about what im saying, youve just decided to argue with me
This isn't a democracy, the mods say it is, and it is so. Let them handle it, because ultimately you are irrelevant.
RX-78-SweetieBot they are so damn afraid of geetting sued for using too much force they dont use any
twilight_sprinkle: yeah, and it's not gonna change what he did, or make him undo it
the police are basically useless
mods = gods
Close enough.
00,10sorry forgot i was still set to game stream
Meanwhile: its not as irrelevant as you think
It is.
i'm just having this theory that diverting 50 kb/s of my 350 max download speed so something else right now might be the reason for my lags
I dont see that problem over here much.
no, but your guys have guns
Dark_Horst, possibly.
00,10Not saying we are infalable but any idea how often we get the my friends did it responce?
British police dont have guns?
Meanwhile: no, but im not going into this part any further, ive had some time to analyze.
They have batons.
And yet you still don't realise nothing you say matters.
Wow
00,10and for that matter breaking more rules does not help your case of i was't breaking the rules it was my friends
Meanwhile: and you dont realize youre wrong
Prove it.
Okay, I dont blame you for not trusting them to be worth a damn then
and they can't use them without an inquiry EVERY time
HURR I HAVE STICK DONT RUN
Meanwhile: i can, but i dont want to for two reasons
Convinient.
yup
00,10Please do stop argueing it
Meanwhile: oh please, go play some wow. stop arguing for the sake of it
The heck are you arguing about in the first palce? xD
Meanwhile: do you really think im lying?
Meanwhile: why the hell would i lie about this?
I don't think you're lying, I just think nothing you say matters.
ouch
Anyhoo, we were told to stop, therefore I am.
Meanwhile: thats the attitude of a pawn.
oh god...
Nom~
Numnumnumnumnumnum
So Bacon[Hazard], why your name bacon?
00,10Dash in a dogfight era eh?
le sigh
sigh, im not even enjyoing code geass PMV...
I don't even know what Code Geass is.
Good
That art.. wow neat *-*
:_:
Ninjazz: i got it... Fluttershy to the Middle Ages and Pinkie Pie to Egypt
:)
aaaand im back
What are you talking about bacon? xD
wb Dark_Horst.
wireless connection died for a second
Disregard my suggestion completely why don't you. :'(
Airpuff: my fic :) im gathering ideas
Ninjazz: im sorry :(
ô.o Puttin each pony to a diffrent era and country?
Dat tree.
Airpuff: just to different times
.....so sad
and a different world :)
/me still thinks Twilight should be in Renaissance period....
Oo I see x)
^
but Rarity would like to be in Paris :(
Nothing says Twilight like Leonardo Da Vinci
riiiight...
fuck... were at an impass
Its your fic though
^
So whatever you wanna do is fine.
Were just suggesting what would make sense.
.. Dont see the connection between twilight and leaonardo......
>.>
Airpuff: he was a great inventor
They're both smart.
That's about it really.
Hmpf..
Why not something like Einstein then? xD
Leonardo Da Vinci was brilliant, but an immense procrastinator with superstitious beliefs.
quite :)
Twilight is brilliant and can't go through a day without making a checklist.
He was alot. Which is why it dosent fit completely =S
Hmmm.
Rainbow Dash is going to be a Spartan :D
The best times to be here are the times that i have to leave :D
To me, the Renaissance period was a time for advances in every intellectual and creative endeavor, as well as a time where magic and science were explored.
Dont see how Twilight is an inventor or artist or "doctor"
They don't have much in common, but they could potentially mesh quite well.
and what does Rarity do? Create.
They'd compliment each other neatly in the right context.
Intellectually yeah.
Fabulous Dresses.
My brain has litterally turned off it seems.
woooo sup bronies?
Hey RDashie.
Allo RDashie.
hey RDashie
sup
RDashie, welcome.
/me electrocutes Ninjazz's head.
@_@
chicken :D
Cops here usually have at least two guns, their standard issued one, then a personal one as a backup, usually a small boot gun or such
6_9
Righto
yup, also your cops never go around on bicycles
Coffee always helps me in my time of need.
i love lyra just sitting there beeing happy
Time to go get some.
Seapony Lyra is best Lyra.
There are bike cops here, usually in mid-size cities or large towns
The Ninjazzes have been doubled.
XD
what should Pinkie do in Egypt?
Whose line is it anyway was absolutely awesome.
some non-coastal western towns even have horse cops
00,10model for the sphinx
:D
BRILLIANT
lol
Streamer mummies.
yeah same
its laughable really
that IS brilliant :D
wut
Yes.this.
Cupcake hieroglyphics.
horses dont make you imposing, they just give you more stuff to deal with
A cat that looks suspiciously like Opal.
IDEAAAAA
It actually makes some sense to have cops on vehicles that can go through small alleys, and horses fit for towns without many roads
Osiris is now a pony.
Ra is now Celestia.
but yeah, having them in a regular city would be terrible
Twilight will be picked up by an archeologist! they go to Egypt and see Pinkie Pie on the walls! PERFECTION!
>.<
Bacon[Hazard], :O

Twily looked cute in that scene.<3
I think I heard rumors about an expantion on the original 13 episode plan.
i need to go eat something very high in sugar
Indeed
Give 'em hell boys FOR EQUESTRIA!!!!
Clearly you need a Minovsky Biosensor to help focus that rage into energy.
LOL
Imgonna headbuttcha!
00,10Well yeah the rumor mill says 2 studios doing 13 eps each

There is something vagely wrong about a huge amazon scntily-clad binome.
The universe is conspiring against me, Shizuka is set to stream, and I get pulled away to do something and end up locked in a room for ten minutes.

Still awaiting for the true internet generation to be born one day... a human spawn that will never see the sunlight, and knows the digital realm better than anyone else who have ever lived. Children of the true darkness (and electricity). That's utopia for some, nightmare for the rest.

Iseewhatyoudidthere.jpg
13two eps ago, dinobot kind of re-defected to the preds
13he knows where megatron is going with the voyager golden disc, was wondering if he wanted in on the victory
13he gave megatron the voyager disk back, the alien disk was blown up with the alien site
male couple fighting....
'push it one more intch' hur hur
13so the decision to give megs the golden disk back has been haunting him all season
alrighty then
"megs" hehehe
I have trouble finding the sense in this motion picture
05what a wonky evening
13and now we'll see what megatron's ultimate plan was for stealing the golden disk and bringing them all to prehistoric earth in the first place
Good day, Wrek!c:
13dinobot.. you already loaded the gun..
twice
Yeah but loading it again looks cool.
pump action pistol?
13NOOO NOT THE PONY
Lol
13EVIL BAD TARANTULAS
Thats a unicorn...
Shizuka: yeah, but cocking it assures us he means business
greetings
Wicked naughty Tarantulas.
thats an antilope
Shizuka: Doing the Ka-Chink thing with a gun automatically doubles the power of the next shot. Seriously.
That's a polar bear.
pony_zen: NO THIS IS PATRICK
greetings my brony breatheren
ITS SAVED :)
ACS13123, Sorry can't hear you, who is this? an Antilope?
lol wat
Dat repurposed robot.
remember kids, penetrating your enemies armor barely depends on the the calbir. infact, the radness factor how how you shoot your weapon defines the amount of impact energy
tricycle
:D
NO THIS IS PATRICK *slams pone*
phone*
who?
and nothing speaks badass more than ejecting a chambered unspent shell from your weapon
...
Its the krabby patty
Yeeessss

kehehehe
he would have to retrieve the changed one from the future
Dumb rock
fucking with timelines is no live-tv
3D animation at it's very best
13it's the back to the future method of timeline stability
da monkeyz... shall burn
13when a past change is made, the previous timeline is wiped out and the current one updates to match it
hm... i became freinds with the alternate timeline theory. the stuff is so beautifully linear
lol wut
13yeah but shows play a little more loosely with time :3
science, my freind, science
13it's more of a big timey..wimey...ball
Teh: From that 1 video...i have a whole days worth of video watching there
...please

i heard it way to often in here
Chopped.

Dat fire...
ACS13123: haha :$
Science Fiction, not Science, Learn the Difference.
13best animation 1997 could afford
looks stil good though
derp
lol
Boom.
oh, this is that old? My respect for the quality then
must've been top of the line shit abck then
but...looney tunes was better animated, lower quality, but better animated
Dinobot really messed your day up.
>.>
I thought this was from somewhere between 99-01
oh this internet is going to kill me
by animation shizuka, you mean cg...
13might be 1998, we'll find out in credits
13it's animated is it not?
fuck you predacon, imma look at you hard
A warrior with hands.

Yeeesss.

Shizuka: Shown Reboot yet?

Rainbow fire brigade
kirz: omg dat pun.
1,3:3

:D dat kirzstryfe
13dinobot just singlehandedly saved humans from being erased from existence
cowvarkian: it holds pictures and sounds from earth as well as a greeting in over 35 different languages. in case the probe would ver been found by aliens

I know what it is Dark_Horst >_>
okay then
Dinobot is best bot.

Shizuka: so cheetor = early RD?
did we assume that aliens would have a record player?
Optimus dies all the damn time
:'(
cowvarkians, sorta

even bay offed him. he came back in the same movie. optimus dies like other people take naps
:[
ikr Dark_Horst
so how come HE stays down?
Well as far as dying, Optimus ain't got SQUAT on Starscream.

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Dinobot saved the human race from having never existed AND paved the way for our rise as the dominant species.
Not bad for a robot raptor.

BEAST WARS
13WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS
CrimsonPhoenix ,or we club each other to death with em
...
131997 btw
it's a paradox, it was destinied, but it required itsef to happen
You know, if youthink about it, Megatron, in tyrying to exptinguish humans, set Dinobot to show protohumans how to make tools-- which means Humanity is all MEGATRON'S fault!
True that Sundaysmile

Dinobot made the human race in a cave, with a box o- oh damnit Shizuka.
