11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Rarity's wings might be a reference to the Flutter Ponies of the old My Little Pony series in 1986, whose sheer butterfly wings were notoriously fragile. The wings are also reminiscent of the Breezies in the direct to video movie My Little Pony: The Princess Promenade in 2006.

4Did we have names for the other three WBs at the competition?
is there anyway to the chat next to the video? i hate having to scroll
11There are ten wonderbolts in totla. The three always seen (Spitfire, Streak, and Soarin) are the lead fliers, who also head the PR. The other three seen flying with them (Streamline, Ace, and Blitz) are side-flyers who keep up with the stunts. The last four (Turbo, Backdraft, two unnamed), are emergency backup fliers.
*sips tea*
I wouldn't be surprised if Scootaloo was related to Fluttershy
soooooooooooo smoth
Spoiler its not zecora that turns her to stone
We do need more Zecora
She's not

0SB IS BEST PONY
11LATE RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: When the Cutie Mark Crusaders enter Fluttershy's house, one of them proceeds to yell: "Are those tickets?" which likely means that the Grand Galloping Gala still hasn't happened yet.

/me Scootaloo shifted uncomfortably in her pauldrons, she never liked how the chainmail chafed on her wings. "So when are the Zebra heathens coming Sweetie Bell?" She couldn't wait to show Commander Rainbow Dash how awesome she was. This was her time to shine!
Eveypony knows AB is WORST CMC.

11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: The title of this episode may be literally referencing the Cutie Mark Crusaders' antics, in which they perform a theatrical showstopper - a performance that garners enthusiastic or prolonged applause. An alternate meaning in business terms, however, is an action or event that puts a halt to all other activities until it can be resolved.

It's not that they couldn't fix the table, they just didn't know that they were building a table.
My big sis was really nice to give us that treehouse.
Okay, I get that Scootaloo is really good at Scooting... And Sweetie Belle being good at singing kinda makes sense...

11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: The Cutie Mark Crusaders' costumes during their performance are typical late 1970s/early 1980s glam rock outfits. Their costumes also resemble those of such cartoon bands as the Misfits from the mid 1980's animated series, Jem and the Holograms, or Funky Jan and the Animal Kingdom from the late 1970's animated special,

11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: At the end of the episode Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash arrive backstage and meet the Cutie Mark Crusaders. While Applejack is Apple Bloom's sister and Rarity is Sweetie Belle's sister, Rainbow Dash is not related to Scootaloo, as stated by Lauren Faust. However, Rainbow Dash's presence suggests that they may have a connection.

Snails and Snips should get more screen time
This episode made me look forward to Diamond Dogs so much, but not one direct reference to Bowie.
I love how they had a medal already made for that

No soup for you!
How did they get that off without ripping it?
Applebloom's kung fu treachery was awesome though.
You know, there's no chance that all 3 of them are going to get their cutie marks at the same time. What happens when one of them does?
THE PLOT CONTINUS

The lesson here is don't lie to children and make them think they can do things they can't.

Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that being a total bitch fucking works. Men are so goddamn easy to manipulate.
THOUSANDS OF LASER SWORDS!
0Ghosties ... wow ... just wow
Just because somepony is white doesn't mean she can't dance.
03why does "cooling pad" make me think of something you'd find next to other feminine products

@Desmond...wtf?
/me runs
Why did she grab the half eaten one?
its useful for her job...
Thats nice Ghosties
Rarity has to keep calling herself a lady because she hates that she lives in a podunk town with a tiny, little known boutique.

I don't understand why Rarity gets ultra-luxury, but FS is barely pampered

I love this song. =/
11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Pinkie Pie sings the verse from her Gotta Share song, "Both our diets, I should mention, are completely vegetarian", which contrasts with previous episodes that have shown or hinted at the Ponies including meat based products, such as hotdogs and ham sandwiches, into their diets.
*has already seen the image a kajillion times*
Why does everyone hate this song?
Everyone at least in in the show hates this song

11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: This episode, along with Applebuck Season and Fall Weather Friends, had hinted that Equestria's ponies may have omnivorous tendencies, making them more human-like than horse-like. In the case of A Bird in the Hoof, during a brief scene where Applejack tries to decide what to eat, a sandwich with a thin slice of meat on it can be seen,
OM NOM NOM
11possibly a boloney sandwich. Applejack almost even ate the said sandwich. These hints may be accidents on the part of the production staff, as meat should not be part of the ponies' diet.
