Sorry about that.
Personally I think martial arts training is a bit pointless without contact sparring.
http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4824788_460s_v2.jpg
I learned a bunch of mostly-useless kicks. It was good for impressing people, though, until I lost all flexibilit.
*flexibility
Hear hear.
Sorry
...
Martial arts training is really useful as a) an emotional outlet, and b) teaching kids discipline.
FUCK

Yeah, ganking is a fundamental.
:D
Played DoTA
11,01The other song is Stupify if anyone's wondering.
Not lol or DoTA2
Don't have one
sorry
11,01Don't have XBL.
My GW PvP is silly
...nah I ment now.
I would've liked the XBOX if I did have any interest in it.
All teleports, knockdowns and attacks that spike on the knockdowned
11,01PC gaming is my future.
Oh and my teleports knock you down
...i don't know just pick something
11,01I'm not buying a PS4 or 720,
All the LoL stuns last for like, 1.5 seconds because the damage to health ratio is preposterous.
11,01WII U is possible.
I have a feeling the Wii U may have everyone I know on it.
but anywho
this aint rise against tho
this is Disturbed
I said, "Um you mean Nes"
also ZombiU is in essence a rouge Like
trip wire, tps to an knock downs when target is more than 100m away
GERMANY
Then you don't bother chasing when they flee and repeate
Boom.

If they didn't just get ganked
and i thought it was a normal episode

/me has no idea. :)
I have no clue what's going on. :P
08,01otakon: aye, i see now
yeah, you can see it if you do that
but how many know to do that offhand?
Inb4 something breaks.
something that causing banning should be first and foremost on that topic off the bat.
08,01otakon: well, it's in the topic
aye
8,6otakon, it's in the site rules, and it has been for a very, very long time
spi i i i i i i
8,6now drop it
I haven't been here 5 minutes and I'm stupidly lost
Drop it like it's hot.

08,01otakon: if i kick you on lightIRC, you don't see the kick message, right?
08,01hmm
Saturn: no I see it
I think this is my least favorite episode
Saturn: popup

This is not canon.
Oh its fanvoiced, well i thougt the voice's was weird.

08,01otakon: the whole topic is there when you hover over it
/me flails his arms around and screams like an idiot
Saturn: not many ponies know that
Saturn: yeah but how many people unfamiliar with lightIRC know to do that?
^
to be fair, not many ponies know they are using IRC when using the light client
night
08,01yeah, it's not a very good UI design decision
it'd certainly promote people using external clients xD
....
XD
....
00,10cant see the stream with an external cliant
:D
xd
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
LOL?
Pop out stream should work

Saturn: on paper
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
lol
k
8,6considering nothing was actually linked spoiling anything, and nothing entered into the discussion spoiling anything, it's time to drop the subject, BOTH of you
08,01Meanwhile: well, that's their problem, not mine.
DONT YOU FUCKING DARE

I haven't a response to that.
scuse me, I need to find summink to wipe the drool off my face with...

Me
More or less here
you mean the audio series?
The animated episodes is up to two episodesright?
it needs to be its own show
Hey, dudes! :)
:O
:D
Yeah, that would be a great series
two characters that we created
the possabilities
we named him
?
*whats
they were even cautious about using "Dr. Whooves" as a name.
we already did that
:O)==, I have a Pinkie Pie Launcher, oyur argument is invalid.
:D
:P)== BITCH! DERP LAUNCHER READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
if we asked for it
00,02i have zero darts :(

I litterally facehoof everytime i hear or see a alicorn OC
and with some more views and a little sponsering we can really do this
00,02well
00,02i'm screwed
well....unscrew yourself
sorry that's all i got
?*
hi everypony!
no u mis understand, we already have people making episodes
: D
they just arent well animated
but we could fix that
hahaha
well thats where the money comes in
money is everything!
we pitch in and try and fund a animation team
an*
If the following word begins with a vowel the connective is an.
its basically avertisment
why would they sue
....Sometimes....I like to catch furry things with my arse cheeks
wut.
O__________0
:P
and accepting money for it too
00,02y u no recharge more than one battery :<
00,02its incredibly anoying
...yes
00,02killerpony7733, no, i think it works fine
00,02but it should recharge more than one
00,02meens i can do this
xD
yes
05the mechanic would be completly acceptable had it recharged atleast 2, or all but very slowly
crush him
I have no idea /what/ we're talking about. I've just stopped playing LoL.
ded
:P
Dude that was like 10 minutes ago?
how would they possibly do that. buy some how tracing where all the money came from
fuck superman 64
busting my balls
they have done the animation already and they didnt get sued
If we give critique yes
lol, dude got resist augs
ok then
00,02no fair
00,02Realy no fair
robotic
they must have some kind of emp dampening in there
He should have gotten a stun gun due to how good it is
He has one
but he prob got no ammo
00,02Y U FAIL ME PEPS
heh
lol
they wouldnt see it as copy right just more as a fanmade parody
imean not as a copyright
wtf?
i mean shed.mov and all that shit is well animated and they have a whole season
Another Gigabit stream.
no law sues
He is awesome.
shed.mov is disturbing though
^
the have to be careful with that
00,02y u guys no stand together
05killerpony7733: you got it all wrong.
05we could always charge and accept money
05but it wouldnt be legal
05but we could
05the point here is
05we dont
05casue we aint greedy fucktards
But if we want to donate Can we do it?
no bwrek we arent being greedy
allright :)
i say it could be promising
:)
00,02STAND TOGETHER DAMNIT
05you could donate to us if you wanted as we are already now
05but the thign is
05we dotn accept donations
why would they disagree and sterr up it all up
D:
O.o Be right back gotta Try PlanetS2
how would this show be different
really but yet they have not been sued
and the postman just delivered £13000 worth of paper to my house

"Make more playsets
University of Hull, UK
OBOY
theres laws which means that if they are informed in a certain way
they have no choice but to sue
KSP! KSP!
because americans have some of the stupidest copyright and patent laws in the world
Oh crap.
Dat Skype
actually it is, thats why that had to cease and decists the plushie maker
they have to do something
or they lose their right to the IP
a fanbased animation series is common for them to accept
yeas!
:P
ugh, its to early for this
atleast he survived
Not at all.
they have such a strong suiing culture its enforced by law
which is just stupid
no
an accident by definition has no blame
but you go there and you can sue just about anyone for it
they have never sued anyone for fanbased animations ok
why start now
.me Yawns
Hi!
there is some hope
we hade just as much hope getting derpy back
but we did it
she would have been delated
I just tasted cod tounge
