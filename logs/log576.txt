http://cheezburger.com/6443613952 Sumica
Liokin: I don't think I've seen it but I'm pretty sure Wrek drew it
AttacktheAndalite: -lol he peeked fast.
Liokin: He sure did. Made a splitting decision
AttacktheAndalite: Yeah I thought so. -lol I have your OC but I dont have meanwhile's....he refuses on the grounds I would draw him doing unimaginable things with trixie.
Liokin on vacation:)
OC?
Liokin: I don't recall you ever asking.

What are we talking about?
AttacktheAndalite: That was her name I believe.
Liokin: Oh that one....eh, I like the new one I drew recently.
WraithHoof: (if you DO auto complete to the wrong name, continue hitting tab until it hits the right name)
lolwut?
Can wait to get back home to continue working on my plushie
AttacktheAndalite: I see I see..You looking to get shipped with meanwhile?
NullRadix: Ok thanks:)
Liokin: I go through too many drawings of my OC. I finally got the color scheme how I want it.

Thanks for streaming
Bronysith: Half life 3?
Meanwhile: Sucome to your attack lover and give me your OC image *tries jedi mind trick hand manuever thing*
Liokin: This isn't the OC you're looking for.
Liokin: I also have the Illustrator file, but it's in CS5 and I don't know if you have an older or the new version that came out.
Liokin: you're doing it wrong
AttacktheAndalite: Newer.
vlc pony oO

Bronysith: Gabe Newell walks on stageï»¿ with a big 3 on the screen. He says "I have lost 3 pounds since last E3". Gabe Newell walks off stage

Liokin: So you have 6? Well you can open it but I don't know if you can actually work on it per se, but you can get the color scheme from it.
shana: Who knows.
fthats female
shana: It's female
Body type'd suggest it's female but I 'aint about to go check.
AttacktheAndalite: That was the plan -lol
Meanwhile: I don't know who knows, that's why I am asking

Shoo bee doo! =D
Good evening everypony
i was not expecting this
^
hey Obsidian how you doing
I think they should at least reference seaponies in s3 :D
I was expecting this
Celestia I love my ringtone XD
IT'S BACON AND APPLEJACK
well we should know this is Sumica's sign off video
Obsidian: Sup bro /)
Evening, Obsidian
alexxm: Not bad
Listen to that AUTHENTIC southern Accent.
My house just got blasted with seaponies at 00:32am
I really don't want Sea Ponies in FiM. But so many fans are probably asking for it.
It's Bacon and Applejacks! (part of your balanced breakfast)
Bacon and Applejack.
Liokin: (\
cal on the sea ponies
/me wonders who next streamer will be
String_Shredder: Bacon, Applejack and silly filles :3
why were they in the water in the first place
MEGAN guys! Friggin' MEGAN! It doesn't even sound like they're saying bacon
Why does Megan look like a cosplay version of Apple Jack?
Bacon and Applejack :P
so much laggggg
Hey guys, the lost episode of the buffer show is on
who drew the vlc pony picture?
banarsss: because G4 Applejack is basically ponified Megan :D
^
MadSurge: Time to write some fan fic.
Does Megan run an apple orchard?
Kandarihu: no, but she was a farmer
Liokin: But yeah, it's up to him if he wants to be shipped. I'd rather not have a cinderblock to the head
Megan owns a truck though
good enuff.
AttacktheAndalite: -lol well to be honest you should pick your ship.
Well, even if she doesn't, that's an interesting take on Applejack's design and an idea that they might've written around Marvel's trademark.
curse u buffer
AttacktheAndalite: Find your very special somepony gimme his picture
AttacktheAndalite: And you and him will do this *pause for dramatic effect* SHIP
banarsss: A fine point you make sir. But as you can see attack's very special somepony is a brony.
i love that chrome OC thats linked on that page
banarsss: Therfore your logic has failed :3
Liokin: Oh. *puts pitchfork down*
Alright then.
Okay guys, going to bed. Goodnight, see you tomorrow!
BYE SURGE
banarsss: Why did you get the pitchfork?
AttacktheAndalite: Let me have that link to your DA madame.
CALL ME maybe?
Night, MadSurge
Rest well MadSurge
bye MadSurge
MadSurge: Later bro /)
AttacktheAndalite: Because. I love pitch forks
*Eats a giant stack of pancakes with pitchfork*
you guys seen tombstones new vid?
a song for Colgate
AttacktheAndalite: I think you need more pancakes yourself.
AttacktheAndalite: Pancakes make the world go round
banarsss: I love pancakes~
AttacktheAndalite: I love pitch forks
cone
Chrysalis is it good
no stream....
AttacktheAndalite: -lol! Nice bf..
banarsss: But you rarely need to bring one out unless it's an angry mob tie
AttacktheAndalite: Yeah
AttacktheAndalite: He reminds me of a friend I use to have.
Liokin: ^^ He was nervous about telling me he was a brony.
AttacktheAndalite: Not sure what ever happened to him. He kmoved one day. :/
Liokin: Aww :( I hope you guys still keep in contact
AttacktheAndalite: Why? Im not ashamed to say im a brony. Im 6'5, black, and have a vioce that was gifted wit teh powah of a bass canon. -lol And although I am no monster. They dont know that....
Liokin: My friend told me he couldn't hang out with a dude who watches a little girl's show. And so I stopped speaking with him.
banarsss: IMO smart move on your part. If somepony cant except you how you are. Get rid of em'
Yeah
Liokin: Mmm bass cannon. But yes, he was nervous because he didn't know that I'm a brony. So when I told him I was all "I'm a brony too!" and it all fell into place from there~
Its just buffering for me :(
Malmortius: LOL it's playing just fine for me
Malmortius: You're missing the video maaan
Malmortius: there is no stream at the moment
Everyday ahm bufferin
AttacktheAndalite: -lol yes bass canon >:3 I love how I appear. Cause Nopony ever expects me to be a brony. No pony ever would. -lol So I get to troll by nature :3
AttacktheAndalite: And D'awwww that is such a sweet story ~Sweetie Belle
Liokin: why is that Liokin?
banarsss: Why is what?
Liokin: Nobody expects you to be a brony. I think most average people don't expect men to be bronies
Especially grown men
suddenly so quiet
banarsss: I practically ooze masculinety. I love a challenege. IN FACT I have broken a guys hand arm wrestling. So the idea of me cuddling a Twi Plushie at night is a shocker to most.
Liokin: Ohhh XD. like the world's manliest brony
banarsss: :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNryNfvcQlY
Liokin: His friends and family know. Well his sister does becase he's ordering 2 pony shirts for me and one of his friends is a brony as well so awesoome. I have a friend that I recently welcomed into the herd
AttacktheAndalite: Sadly I haz no other bronys were I am. I dont mind though. I have you all on bronystate and thats enough.
AttacktheAndalite: Also what shirt??? I have the Twi one and A fluttershy and I want a DJ-pon3 but I have to find one.
Liokin: And that's all that matters! Where are you located, anyways?
AttacktheAndalite: The armpit of the world.
AttacktheAndalite: alabama -lol
montgomery to be exact.
Liokin: One of them is a derpy shirt and I think the other one is Pinkie with a cupcake on her head.
bored
Liokin: Aaaah. I live in South Carolina~
AttacktheAndalite: Must have derpy shirt....
That feeling when you fall asleep wit your laptop on o.o
AttacktheAndalite: -lol well you will or probably already have seen me.
*with
Liokin: I'm pretty sure California is the arm pit of the world.
banarsss: What makes you say that?
Lol
http://i.imgur.com/tIsc5.jpg
AttacktheAndalite: I go to parts of south california at times for my work.
It's california man
RAWRity: I love NEIL GAIMAN
banarsss: aannd?
Liokin: Which parts? I live in Columbia and Columbia is a wide area of the Midlands
is stream off?
oni_link: Do you live there?
RAWRity: Nice. Now show me your sword! =D
banarsss: eeyup
Liokin: later
oni_link: *takes hat off* *gives it to you* *Strolls away in my old chap suit*
-lol Everywhere I've been to columbia. IN FACT I will be in colombia in about....
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvUE77nTYfQ old but good
banarsss: what just happened? I got a hat at least. :D
RAWRity: Then I shall wait.
AttacktheAndalite: Ill be in colombia again in 2 weeks for metal work.
Liokin: Whenn? Oh and SC is the armpit of ther world
oni_link: Hweh
Liokin: Nice :3
SirGanjalf: Valve needs Meet the Announcer!!
AttacktheAndalite: I think Nevada comes close :P
the other thing I got today was this: http://i.imgur.com/0x6bE.jpg
hmm
oni_link: I think SC is. We're the laughingstock of the country.
AttacktheAndalite: -lol i'll only be there for a few days but you'll no me if you see me. If you think its me run up to me and ask to see my shirt. I will be wearing fluttershy or twi :3
AttacktheAndalite: Which part of Columbia and which days? I don't go out much except for classes and those are a t 6pm.
AttacktheAndalite: My condoloences
Im just making sure here but its buffer time right?
banarsss: And miss Pauling and Saxton Hale. Hell, since they've made "Meet the Sandvich", they can as well made "Meet the..." of any weapon.
RAWRity: is that the dvd boxset?
SirGanjalf: YES
oni_link: Yep. That chick who was Miss South Carolina for that pagent who answered that question on why people should read maps. Or was it why should people learn geography
AttacktheAndalite: yikes, almost forgot about that :s
SirGanjalf: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&v=D4YNrzTWyzY&NR=1
oni_link: I don't think anyone could, especially the time it happened.
It would be awesome if Valve decided to bring back the modes related to civilians, announcing it all with a surprise release of a Meet the Civilian video.
AttacktheAndalite: Not sure -lol. Once they fly us out there we split up and work on several different things in several different locations. thats why I said you've probably already seen me randomly without knowing who I was. :3
AttacktheAndalite: I mean I wouldn't have remembered if you hadn't brought it up. We have tons of airheads here in California too. I think theres people like that anywhere though
AttacktheAndalite: Its not like we could hang out or anything. After all I am going to be on the clock but if you should see me gimme a bro hoof -lol
Liokin: I don't go out much, and I definitely don't go downtown much either. Were you at NashiCon sometime in April this year?
Liokin: I shall if I do
AttacktheAndalite: Sadly no. But I wll be at BUCK and a few other brony conventions coming up.
all i see is Liokin and AttacktheAndalite
Liokin: Sweeeeet. RoundCoun is next month and there's going to bronies there, I know for a fact
AttacktheAndalite: Well whenever I touch down I'll use my laptop and drop you a line on bronystate telling you were I am if you would like to come and see me -lol or if you'd like to sit and chat Id be more than happy to buy lunch for you.
le wild Bronysith appeared! FUUUUUUU, my box is full
dat singing announcer :D
AttacktheAndalite: Sounds interesting i'll have to check in on it.
Liokin: You'd best hurry though. I'm sure pre-reg is over by now.
AttacktheAndalite: I'll get on it asap.
AttacktheAndalite: I know someone you might know.
AttacktheAndalite: Do you know "Jaxblade?"
Liokin: Um...I'm afraid I don't
AttacktheAndalite: One sec.
no one is streaming ATM?
eeenope
Firelight: Nope.
banarsss: lol
K... Bleh.
AttacktheAndalite: This knuckle head -lol http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvuN_dpV8B4
Since their is no one streaming.. Video time.
Liokin: 16 minutes....
What the heck
banarsss: You only have to watch like 20 second in -lol
Liokin: Is that YOU?
banarsss: He's the black guy
banarsss: -lol noooo he's a close friend of mine though.
no stream?
Liokin: NICE
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys8gg-NKdD0
nope no stream
Liokin: I saw that part of the stream when it wasn't lagging.
AttacktheAndalite: -lol I was there at brony con with him.
AttacktheAndalite: I wasnt a celeb like him though.
Liokin: OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD~ All my envyyy
AttacktheAndalite: -lmao atleast thats what he calls himself.
so when is season 3 coming out i figured it would be september
alexxm: Yeah it is.
AttacktheAndalite: Well he sent a call out for black bronys
alessm: First it was going to be in august.
thanks Firelight
Alexxm*
AttacktheAndalite: And I answered and he invited me and quite a few other black bronys to go with him.
AttacktheAndalite: You should come with us next time -lol
Liokin: Sweeet. If I had the money and didn't have school I would have gona
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP8Wmw0UpBg
AttacktheAndalite: Noo no no He was a special guest we got in free cause we were with him -lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhif1x_d_AQ Oh my gos watch this video! <3
The way Jaxblade got into the show is just like me :D I was like alright, just a few more. Then I saw them all lol
AttacktheAndalite: School is important though. :3
Liokin: Sweet but I still had school and I'm not sure if my parents would have let me go
Liokin: Is it for blacks only?
banarsss: -lol no of course not.
Liokin: Oh
AttacktheAndalite: Yeah I hear ya'
Firelight: I love those BlackGryph0n vids :)
oni_link: I know right? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wblE8YYLyQ0&feature=relmfu
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9-N16CkNs&feature=relmfu
banarsss: But that specific call out was for black bronys because its kind of hard for some black bronys to come out of the dark and admit there fandom.
Liokin: Oh, cause of stereotypes.
Well I need to get going. Til nextime everypony.
banarsss: Yes and no.
bye Obsidian
Bye Obsidian
so Liokin what games do you have on steam
/me salutes Obsidian
Firelight: the one that started it all but i think that the Fluttershy one is my favorite :)
alexxm: Just TF2 on this specific PC
So wait.. Tara Strong is the voice of Poof from Fairly odd Parents? Hm.
Liokin: Elaborate more?
ok Liokin if you want to add me my steam names alexxm1
alexxm: I have audio surf and a few others on a different one.
alexxm: Sure bro.
ok Liokin is audiosurf fun it looked fun to me
._.
alexxm: If your a music pony. Or just somepony who enjoys there music. Yes.
whats streaming right now, its not working for me
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6djynjqXS4&feature=related
the buffer show is on
banarsss: Well for the most part black commmunity is pretty much assigned as gender.
banarsss: If you a male your rowdy and a show off
oh thanks alexxm
banarsss: If your female youve got attitude and ghetto coming out of the wazoo
hello everypony
banarsss: Black bronys tend to be more...non- ghetto
Hello brony_swan
ello brony_swan
banarsss: And to others thats about the equivalent of being an alien.
bored
hey brony_swan how've you been
good
banarsss: So they pick on us and what not for being different. Say that we pain ourselfves and call us gay and what not.
paint*
Liokin just ignore them thats what i do anyways
banarsss: It oesnt phase me personally. But for other more meek black bronys it kills them on the inside.
banarsss: And the point of the trip was to show them that they are not alone.
no stream? also hi everypony :)
banarsss: And Id say it was a pretty succesful trip -lol
hey Quick_Thinker how've you been
there was this guy on here, name was dumptruck i think, collin' us gay an fags....hmmm
ello Quick_Thinker
alexxm: Thats great advice. But it doesnt always help some.
Liokin: Yeah.
brony_swan: really? when was this?
alexxm: they will go into hiding and coneal it like its a crime.
i've been good alexxm i just got back from my neighbors house after watering his plants while hes on vaction
yesterday , crashed my chat
spam
brony_swan i think i remember him we just ignored him or didn't let him get to us
yea, but when it causes real trouble...
WE
NEED
STEAM
Stream too*
Steam engines?
ha
lol
AttacktheAndalite: Any who http://fav.me/d4vr3sq <---this is the image of your finished product correct?
/me releases steam all over chat
/me burns
mmmm...steam feels nice...-_-
O_O
Liokin: But like I said. It's basically stereotypes
Liokin: Nope. That was done earlie this year. The one I posted earlier is going to be the final product
banarsss: Yes and no -lol Yes it is a stereo type to catagorize by race and geneder. No it is not because brony and non-brony is not a predjuudice in common society. -lol
Have some Derpy!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc-YMUWvA1s
banarsss: Yet anyways.
oh my goooooood, I love this philly cheese sammich
AttacktheAndalite: Earlier?

Liokin: But if you look at it as a whole, society is prejudiced against those who are different
what be this
Which being a brony is about.
Oh Streaaam

I learned a bunch of mostly-useless kicks. It was good for impressing people, though, until I lost all flexibilit.
*flexibility
Chuck, it;s the streamer's ping sound
Hear hear.

Well. It's useless for combat.
Sorry
Finally someone who gets that.

Martial arts training is really useful as a) an emotional outlet, and b) teaching kids discipline.

Aye, but for practical defense it's pretty shocking.
Firelight is now AFK.

/me loves Nitt-any_Dis-cord
Seriously wth is this
11,01Can you see the video fine?
Hoi Nittany_Discord, I bought you a present. *hands present giftwrapped in MLP paper*
I suspect that this game is less than... good.
Nittany_Discord: yeah
Coin only has two possible outcomes.
we can see the vid
Nittany_Discord: a bit pixellated, but okay :)
So flip it a lot.
Nittany_Discord: yeah, maybe a bit lowish framerate
its a little pixelated but otherwise fine
the pings a little distracting
11,01I have FMLE settings set to low.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: somepony else confused you with me (or is it vice-versa?) and tried to tell me (or you) what does the ''n'' word mean. that's what the hell is happening

Hm..
Powerpoint XD
XAX: totalbiscuit reviewing...something
11,01WTF is...Revelations 2012
11,01It's a bad game based off of L4D2.
hehe ilike my oc to be a foal they seem to have the most fun

11,01Big heart! +10 health.
e to pick up :D
i actually like it when games like that
11,01Whale heart is +100 health.
watching totalbiscuit play magicka with bluexephos is so much fun
when you have to actually do something to get gealth/ammo
No one on my friends list owns Revelations 2012
Nittany_Discord: Your own heart?
okay, good.

Meanwhile: But you cant give credit. Ill come back when Im a little bit MMMMMM richer
LEGO Universe is pretty much shut downed now. They were lacking money, I think. You needed a full membership (with money, of course) to play the full game.

I expect they could do it in a much more enthusiastic, amusing manner though.
Kencolt: I dont think they say these things without reason
Nittany_Discord: What if he tryed to blend a Fluttershy figurine, and he says "Will it blend?" Then Fluttershy rises from the ashes and he says "Nope."?
/me 07,01is glomped
dafuq are we watching? :o
A Let's Play is different from a speedrun
ekips: Ignorance is bliss and this video's Retsupurae.
did I hear rainbow Dash?
Yeah.
11,01He said Rainbow Dash.
Whoa
i heard a rainbow dash
Alright. probably the only criticism I agree with is about the speedrunning.
ekips: You have no permission to do the math.
I thought he said "bash" personally.
Rainbowdashwhat? :O
I need to hear this once more
I called it first. I WIN!
ponies .everywhere
Rainbow Dash
he did ...
Audio.
RAINBOW DASH IN THERE
HM.

He DID say that.
I have still no idea what's going on in the video since I can't understand a thing what they are saying..
hows you doing Luna?
Wow.. I called it first.. I WIN
Meanwhile, how do I deal with a co-author who can't write that doesn't involve self-harm?
07,01busy as always Ryunosuke, how are you?

Firelight: You're killing your audio by the chokehold. Are you alright?
Luna: do you like bananas?

Nittany_Discord: No no no, "Rainbow Dash'en there"

This is a "How bored can I sound while doing this" run.
They obviously do not know the meaning of a tool-assisted run.
This isn't even using save states at all
The multi-Voices are killing me.

Who touched my minute?
Nittany_Discord: So conversion imminent?
BlazeAngel: I was surprised, it went pretty well 6_9
11,01AttacktheAndalite: Wut?
Not sure I'd call that solved...
Rubix Smoothie has a nice ring to it.
Puzzle smoke dont breath this.

It costs $400,000 for Gabe Newell to work onï»¿ Half-Life 3....for twelve seconds.
Nittany_Discord: Ponies47 told his dad that he's a brony and it went surprisingly well
I did the same thing to my rubiks cube. Chunked it in the blender cause I couldnt solve it and shouted out "Lets see if they can solve you...IN HELL
The computer from Wargames could solve a rubiks cube faster than that.

Can somebody PM me a link to this?
WindWhistler: I know, I'm just saying. Also, you forgot centipedes
BlazeAngel: just look up Rainbow Dash Presents

otakon: I dont know... Honestly. but its awesome
Meanwhile hey amumu is dangerous as hell
8,6I think it'd be fun to do an RP session with one of the pony rulesets that are out there, but I'm no good as a DM >.<
Sanjitenks1989: um no I don't think so.
11,01It all depends on if I can seure this part.

11,01Someone do a remix of his pings.
Though the savage worlds one worked really well
I forgot how I came about this song, honestly. Which means I forgot how I became a brony. Oh god, I'M HORRIBLE
Hai Sumica
AttacktheAndalite, are you a girl and once AttackWithHugs?
dis video is giving me diabeetus
MASF123: Yes and yse.
Toyed with the other system ones a few times
The .MOVS Series Made me a brony. Ceriousity Got Over me. :D
But tbh pony leads its self to a low dice system
...So you never left...except for KwakLad..
Nittany_Discord: That would end up sounding like Avast Fluttershys Ass with WOAHs and Oh Mai~s added to it
Just as its so much more RP than G :p
I think Friendship Is Witchcraft made me a brony
MASF123: nope
Firelight: WE CRANK THAT BABY UP TO 11 AND IT CLEANS THE DISHES AT A MICROSCOPIC LEVEL

Nittany_Discord: disturbed was kewl until they became for the environment and political bullshit
11,01I still love this song.
evening, everypony :)
Hello new person
Anything with an invuln ability is cheap.
11,01Its only one of two Disturbed songs I really like.
I mean hello...
Nittany_Discord: it is good. but i dont like it when people jam their political views down our throats
Hello ^^
11,01I know this one is environmental.
Gank is a valid stratery
My GW PvP is all about the Gank
Ok that's cheap
/me waves hello though he is not new
Do you play LoL?
not my fault people can't survive for 3 seconds
Nope
/me 11,01rocks
/me waves to Sylandest
/me waves back
Yeah, ganking is a fundamental.
:D
Played DoTA
11,01The other song is Stupify if anyone's wondering.
Anypony want to play Xbox with me?
Not lol or DoTA2
Don't have one
sorry
11,01Don't have XBL.
My GW PvP is silly
MASF123: im pc gamer for life
MASF123: ill add you if you want, but i dont think im gettng on today
viva lo pc
...nah I ment now.
I would've liked the XBOX if I did have any interest in it.
All teleports, knockdowns and attacks that spike on the knockdowned
11,01PC gaming is my future.
MASF123: what game?
Oh and my teleports knock you down
11,01Unless I buy the Android box.
Does your health pot cause knockdown as well?
...i don't know just pick something
11,01I'm not buying a PS4 or 720,
Nittany_Discord: wat??
Nittany_Discord: pc gamer for life
Nope no HP pots
Nittany_Discord: or wiiu
NEWS FLASH! Vinyl doesn't always play dubstep and electronic music! she plays other music. she's a DJ so she doesnt always really make the music
Nittany_Discord: no buying wiiu for you
All the LoL stuns last for like, 1.5 seconds because the damage to health ratio is preposterous.
Bronysith: WiiU :)
oni_link: no!
11,01WII U is possible.
I have a feeling the Wii U may have everyone I know on it.
pc, xbox, sony, nintendo <3
Rise against is the stuff!
PC PC PC PC, super nintendo, nes, n64, ps2, ps1
but anywho
this aint rise against tho
It's Tele to, causes knock down, attack that works only on those knocked down activates next chain a knock down attack, another on knockdown hit
this is Disturbed
Wii U im only getting becuase of ZombiU but hey i love nintendo
some yaboh at my school said this. "Super mario bros is awesome for the super nintendo"
dont point at meh bro
Big spike based on how many skills I have still on CD
I said, "Um you mean Nes"
also ZombiU is in essence a rouge Like
"Well NES and Super nintendo are same thing"
Bronysith: WHAT. o_o
Bronysith: I like all those things but i getting tired of current gen consoles...halo was the only reason i got an xbox. if they went back to pc releases, i wouldnt even bother
trip wire, tps to an knock downs when target is more than 100m away
god why didn't you killed him?
GERMANY
I never was a PC gamer, my 1st console was a NES after that it's been console after console for me.
Then you don't bother chasing when they flee and repeate
Boom.
lol

If they didn't just get ganked
and i thought it was a normal episode
/me gently and barely pokes Meanwhile
11,01A lot of why I don't want to buy the next gen consoles can be summed up by a Jimquisition vid.
Oh, I thought this was going to be the pony compilation.
ive seen this video :$
/me slaps Bronysith with a cinderblock.
Pinkie said it herself TWILIGHT IS BEST PONY
/me explodes on Meanwhile

Nocturn is hax ganks.
Why is everyone explode in the chat?
Also I have a silly skill that gives deep wound and extra damage on my first hit

Deep wound is a condision that lowers max HP by 20%
is this POnies Randomly explode?
Ducks: were outta here
/me 11,01adasdad the toilet
Wow. Flutterpony Rarity exploding was just perfectly timed.
lol
condition*
So the spike only has to deal 80% of their max HP on a fresh target
MASF123 i just take some things to the extreme also i have been in this chat room for at least a month now
/me licks Nittany_Discord in the ear
hahaha :D
NO! Can't I leave to Eat a Corn Dog without Missing ponies?! :(

If you tweak it abit...
ello everyone
Nittany: I can sum up my reasons for only having interest in the Wii U in a few sentences. "Two out of the three consoles' owners are making strides to develop technology that can interrupt my games with ads. Guess which of the three isn't doing that."
PEWDIEPIE! aint no party like a Pewdiepie party... and Aint no party like a Pinkiepie party

11,01CK|GW2: Same two have been rumored to include anti used-games tech in their consoles.
CK|GW2: and Nintendo's strong suit is their software, them finally stepping up to HD gaming is a plus. Also, theyre finally getting good 3rd party support
My Little Explosions: Boom Boom Time is Magic

Oh, so you're the hunter of GW
this is fun
BOOM!
nice name
I like "BOOM"
Nittany_Discord: might?
hai AttacktheAndalite
BOOM!
Nittany_Discord: that would be... retarded
the cutiemark aqusition program?
Nittany_Discord: Sure hope Nintendo won't let them
/me cries at the thought of Origin on WiiU
She said BOOM!
11,01Maybe forcing Origin to be installed in order to play Wii U titles.
BOOM!
11,01I have that feeling.
-_-
perfect
Dat chatbox
Nittany_Discord: I happen to be going to a Wii U related event this Friday. If I note anything of the sort I'll report it to you
Nittany: Well EA hasn't even said they are in support of Wii U.
Ponies47: :$
Nittany_Discord: or how about having half the disc
that would be down right stupid
"I dare you to LOVE ME"
BOOM!
i would cry Nittany_Discord
:(
BOOM!
This calls for a secondary explosion
oh no
Nittany_Discord: If Origin is gonna be on the Wii U you can guarentee it
A daily fee of 19.95
Alright I'm done.
Nittany: The only company to wholeheartedly throw itself behind Wii U so far is Ubisoft.

da stream, it is borked
Bass cannon?
If I was a mod my ping would be *Squee*
AttacktheAndalite: not spamming really
I swear, the IDF posted a video of their blowing up a palestinian weapons cache that would be perfect for the "exploded twice" thing.
GabeMoist: yeah you do.
Vinyl_Scratch yea, chat only lets you type a caertain number of letters
It's just such a fast chain attack if it goes perfectly
Worked like lynx in a gay bar.
Vinyl_Scratch: I don't think it'll work mate, how about a link to the text?

cya troll
bye Trollberry
:L
11,01I bet EA wants you to, though.
Nittany_Discord: noononono. they do make you sign a user agreement to play ea games on console..fucking shit
One does not simply skill in mmo.
1v1 vs any none heavy class is an almost guaranteed kill
Meanwhile: oh
LOVE M-M-M-M-M
What's goin on
?
11,01Bronysith: And this is why EA is so hated.
??
Bronysith: they do. to connect to their servers.
the day EA takes over...
Bronysith really?
Nittany_Discord: and they wonder why they are hated
It's surviving whith all your skills bar 1 on cool down that's the fun part
See you all Later. I'm getting off. See you all at 11.
11,01Jim Sterling did a vid on it.
11,01It's a good vid.
take care Firelight
nite Firelight
by Firelight
Nittany_Discord, Have you seen When I'm EA?
bye*
Jim always does good videos though
EA compared Origin to Steam... with Facebook and MySpace
That and making sure it will work
play maqic.MOV
âââââ
magic*
Bronysith: then making Origin was a giant middle finger to PC gamers, oh look, we know you guys like Steam but we are gonna fuck that up for you now...
Nittany_Discord: "all we do is, backstab valve, hold out on whole games for dlc later at outragous prices, bribe game reviewers, and act like total dicks to our customers. why do they hate us?"
It's very nasty as a callable spike in a mostly pressure team
Im seeing more games that make you register the darn game as soon as you install it? what is that about?
spell-of-gaming: origin, is, of course,myspace.
Magic *snort* *snort*
If Fluttershy says "LOVE ME!!" one more time.......

If you guys could marry a girl in real life who had the exact same hairstyle and personality as a pony, WHICH WOULD IT BE?
no play youtube poop my little porno friendship with benefits.....
RARITY FTW
adasdad: Actually, they said Origin is Facebook. what.
PC games
Malmortius idunno, be kinda weird
somuchpony: You're gonna mute your computer?
Malmortius: dont make me choose :(
no
For killing runners in capture games and picking off lone fighters.
Dat Ass
lol
It's got no stoping power
Is there any evidence around that EA is bribing game reviewers?
Nittany_Discord: we should make a reality show called "gamers strike back"
Malmortius: Fluttershy or Twi. Probably Twi since our personalities are similar
I moved the recycle bin from the part of my desktop marked "rubbish" and reserved it for origin. the only reason i have itr is bf3.
would link a video, but stream is on
Nittany_Discord: where we track down EA workers, and beat the shit out of them
.me is ded
And while I have managed to 1v3 it was pure luck
11,01Bronysith: Don't forget "Punish consumers in our war with used games" and "suck dev teams dry"
/me is ded
Battlefield 4, anyone?
Bronysith, who would fund it? I sure as hell won't.
adasdad: and soon so will i :(
Bought Roller Coaster 3 a couple weeks ago - a bit aged - but it wanted my address among other things - wouldnt let me play if I didnt answer all those damn boxes
1v2 requires the second to be weak already
Rarity would be best in real girl form. Dat pale skin and purple hair. MY FAVOURITE COLOUR.
Nittany_Discord: who is worse. PETA or EA
Bronysith, so you're advocating violence?
Best RCT is 1
dumb question
/me 07,01revives somuchpony

/me roleplays excessively
Malmortius: its a tie between Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash for me
07,01de noms have been trippled!~
In LoL you don't 1v2 unless the 2 in question will both die in a hit each.
/me gives Luna a Phoenix Down
/me gives luna a falcon punch
*It did nothing....*
a wild flutter rage appeared
More or less the case in GW
/me huggles Luna
or you play mundo

The amount of /me in that chunk of chat is too damn high.
Hey everypony!
Pinkie IS a gamer.
Mundo is a bastard.
Or are a fighter/dervish
and fanfic writer TheBelgianNotBelgian
Calcos323: hi
You know, if you were to ask me who is worse between PETA and EA, I'd say PETA is worse. EA at least makes games that are of some value to some people. PETA is just a hate group.
lali-ho Calcos323
With the right build
play the video
yes he is
11,01Sorry for the pause.
TheBelgianNotBelgian: I always though RD would be most likely in the Frat-brother playing halo with the bros sort of way
11,01Fixing the audio repeater.
A dervish an 1v3
11,01Been fighting that all night.
Peta is funneh
Nittany_Discord: Why laptop?
If you go 1v3 on LoL you might as well order your tombstone first.
Cos your attacks hit up to 3 per swing
I'd rather play platformers than Halo XD
lol
GET THAT LIST OUT OF HERE!
WalkerPony89, yeah. True
explosions
And you can be super tankie
And just out pressure them
It's fine Nittany_Discord, I enjoy watching Pinkie stare at Aj's ass. :D
Well you might die
boom
11,01Is there a sound lag??
lol
no
none at all nItt
WalkerPony89: they murder creatively and ingenuity and imagination something the world is much more lacking for than cats and dogs.
pow
11,01It's just on my end then.
DARP
But you can lock 3 for I'd say a good 10 seconds at least
DERP
your Twilight Sparkle evolveded into a Rapidash
Before you team can help
boom
Tanks don't do enough damage at high level for them to go 1v3 with anything bar maybe Fortune Teemo and Zhao at close range.
8,6Dervish was always good for holding people up and making them focus on you
I think the audio is a split second behind the video.
atomic piano
dick
11,01I have to force a sound lag on my end to keep under/overflows from happening.
11,01Which cause those stutters.
Yup
Nittany_Discord:
wow
Very nice pressure
lol
wow
/me understands not even the slighest of what he's talkng about.
11,01I really hope I get that motherboard.
Wow. Perfectly timed ping

Unless you're Morde.
Was Dervish, monk, Necro/Mesmer, Assasin
5man wild card
In which case walk in there and soak up everything.
otakon: It isn't to such an extent that I would say that EA is worse than PETA. There are still plenty of creative games coming out nowadays. There's more uncreative crap, but still, EA isn't responsible for a majority of that

08,01imma calm down
08,01sorry otakon
I said I didn't see what he said it there in topic

8,6and superretroworld, wasn't planning a ban, just the warning so it didn't lead to anything else
This entire discussion is goofed.
I'M WEARING A WOODEN TIE!

/me has no idea. :)
08,01Rain: what? how does that even...
If you want to see the topic in the embed, hover your mouse pointer over the top box
I have no clue what's going on. :P
08,01otakon: aye, i see now
otakon, type /topic #bronystate
yeah, you can see it if you do that
Rain: We going to tell everyone who joins the chat that?
but how many know to do that offhand?
08,01i'm going to talk to the admins about changing the chat embed
or hovering your mouse over the channel name
Inb4 something breaks.
08,01because this flash client does my freakin' head in
08,01it's broken, useless, and just... urgh
something that causing banning should be first and foremost on that topic off the bat.
08,01otakon: well, it's in the topic
and thus ends Quick's little chat story of o-meters THANKS FOR READING :)
08,01but the chat client doesn't display it properly
aye
8,6otakon, it's in the site rules, and it has been for a very, very long time
spi i i i i i i
8,6now drop it
I haven't been here 5 minutes and I'm stupidly lost
for people using the site to come into chat, maybe a banner onthe webpage itself.. iun all the theatre rooms
08,01Unnr: aye; i'd quite like to put Iris on
bonk
Lunar_Brony: its ok i've been here all day, and i'm lost

See ya'll later hopefully.

g'night Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
sorry Dark92Enigma. Tab-fail
otakon, wouldnt work for me :3
it'd certainly promote people using external clients xD
....
XD
the fan voices are actually pretty good
....
08,01otakon: anyone entering a site should have the good sense to read the rules anyway. our rules are in handy bullet points, so ignorance really isn't a defence.
00,10cant see the stream with an external cliant

08,01otakon: see that biiig button at the top of the page that says "rules"?

Oh, I just Derped
08,01we could keep on arguing this all night, but rules is rules
*are
I have that problem a lot.
Considering how MUCH fan content is created, it's sometimes hard to tell what's actually real and what's fan made at times especially in the cases of original animation and music.
08,01if you don't like it, send us an e-mail.
ow
superretroworld: sorry man, you're getting a 24 hour ban.
/me sets Lunar_Brony 's tie on fire
08,01Lunar_Brony: is it because it already had a knot in it?
otakon: didnt we already discussed this?
....
This was a warning otakon
i know when to shut up most of the time, it's an useful skill
otakon: The Epic Pie Time series is a goo example, though the voices are a dead giveaway. That's all I'm saying in this matter.
it doesnt go straight to ban
8,6yeah, please don't feed into it
as far as i know
11,01Stop arguing, K?
thta's why i'm talking here in the first place :p
11,01No-one's getting banned, K?

TheGreatAndPowerfulT: dont' do it, they stink to high heaven.
I get along well with rodents, probably because I also have whiskers.

Is this a fan song, or is that an actual song (like you can buy on a CD in stores?

Yes, they were kidnapped. That's what the song is for. It draws sleeping children out of their beds and they come to the enchantress.

8,6Meanwhile, do I even want to know what he just showed to prompt that response?
Sarcasm levels are through the roof....
im dying i need metal
I do not consider this music. Zelda Step by Ephixa is music. This is noise, in my opinion
SHE CAN'T HANDLE THE SNARK CAPTAIN!
dat d.notive

Corn!
Eh, you'd probably find it irrelevant.
Please?
Corn is best pony
RETURN THE SLAB

For the love of Celestia/Luna do NOT play the Courege video...
otakon: kabob
How about Epic Meal Time FOR REAL eh?
CORN ON THE COB.
w00t
Spectrum_Rush|: kabob?
You know, that's a great idea, putting dubstep on a pony video. Perhaps others will see this and follow suit...nah. This is just too daring and innovative an Idea for it to catch on right now.
Return the Slaaaaaaab
CORN ON THE KABOB!!!!!!
Lunar_Brony: all dubstep is just noies zelda dubstep is more enjoybul noies
XD
Cannot unhear.
LOL
You will never unhear.

The corn on the cob.
On the cooooooooooob
berrygreyandbloodyte: oki

CORN ON THE COB
and REPEAT FOUREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
otakon inb4 Hay Bacon Strips, Hay Bacon Strips, Hay Bacon Strips~
Where did that song come from?
at lest it starwars muisc
There needs to be a full version
Spectrum_Rush|, its misheard lyrics, so who honestly gives two shits?
So which pony do you think is the sexiest?
Now you will always hear this song like this.
Lunar_Brony: no no no, not Ponies version the REAL Epic Meal Time.
AttacktheAndalite: STAR WARS
Wait, what response are you talking about?
AttacktheAndalite: Seriously? You don't know?
AttacktheAndalite, really? Star wars.
Rain: for teh lulz of course
Duel of the Fates from Star Wars: Episode I
Eddmario: Nope
Malmortius: um none. I don't think of ponies as sexy.
THERE'S A FANFIC?!?!!
Rain: I never heard this on Star Wars
LIAR otakon.
otakon oh, Epic Meal Time, gotcha.
Eddmario a fanfic of what?
AttacktheAndalite: It was Phantom Menace. I think.
YES THIS
AttacktheAndalite, then you have only seen the new ones, havent you
SKRIM SMILE?
MURDER TIME
Lunar_Brony: Of that Corn on the Cob vid
murder is smiletastic
Eddmario oh . . . ugh
I can NOT watch this without smiling
KILL ALL THE NPCS
Rain: I've seen all of them at least twice. I need to watch them more because I'm considering getting into it
Eddmario IKR? I'm laughing
pinkie weapons are best weapons
Malmortius: um no, I don't find ponies sexy man. I got nothing against those that do, but I prefer human women of legal age to be clear and concise.
8,6the one about boobs
Meanwhile: I'll have to watch again
11,01Last video. I need to go to bed.
Oh, right.
pinky pie is a master of murder
LIIIESSSS, so many lies otakon!
k. Thx for the epic stream Nittany_Discord
Nittany_Discord: Please, just the link I gave you as final, Nitty pleasey?
Im just kidding, i do find ponys sexy.
um no
The hoof bump part was well timed
There was a close up of a bikini in the related vids.
The mlp kind, that is.
Night, Nittany_Discord~ Thanks for the stream:3
8,6ah
.............ofc you do
:d
especially rarity.
night discord
Nittany_Discord: sleep well mate, thanks for the videos mate!
Malmortius: calm yourself.
And ofc, chat goes "BOOBS". Because chat is mentally 14.
8,6that's just one of the stupid things that happens with a few of those videos >.<
Malmortius please, please, PLEASE(!!!) stop talking about that
:(
Eeyup.
Pinkie needs Pinkie-chucks.
Eddmario: it was all synced , all the kills are in rythm
I wouldnt even say sexy, though. They are just really cute :)
nite Nittany_Discord
which makes them attractive. Mmhm.
hen3ry: no she needs gofer chucks
gnight Nittany_Discord
nite Nittany_Discord
good nite Nittany_Discord
Malmortius Filly Rainbow Dash is down-right adorable
Malmortius: you don't understand how word works, do you?
Und dann the chat got weird
Stop restricting free speech! :(
Night Maid-I mean Nittany_Discord
/me 11,01frees Malmortius
Malmortius: free speech means the government can't censor you. It says nothing about me telling you to sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up.
Malmortius, you may speak about what you want, unless you are in a chat room that has rules against certian things.
Malmortius: no spech for u hahahahaha
Malmortius: That reminds me, political correctness, like the whole Derp censorship moment, is unconstitutional
I said they're attractive, jesus, im not saying anything explicit.
Eddmario: actually it totally is.
Congress shall make no laws. Says nothing about other people.
if you dont like the rules then just get the fuck out. just saying.
<3 Nittany_Discord
Malmortius: nvm speek ur minde amrican
11,01Night fellow maid Eddmario
want this
Eddmario: self-imposed cencorship is completely and totally allowed.
Dude's got a point, he hasn't really said anything against the rules yet.
Indeed meanwhile.
People are so fickle
:O
Und dann Meanwhile made a point of a point
awesome
Malmortius: wrong word hombre
INCOMING PINKAMENA
He's said some...weird stuff, and I don't like where he's going with it, but nothing particularly risque.
"fickle" would mean we were telling you to shut up, then saying it was perfectly fine and encouraging you.
Ok then, touchy? :(
I wonder what happens when you finish of RD using the Pinkamena move...
wombo combos
twilight gets beaten
adasdad, you dont seem to realize that her name is Pinkamena at all times. Her name doesnt change just because her mood changed.
Mother daughter bondign
Eddmario: you're treated to a dramatic reading of My Little Dashie
11,01Haven't seen a second of Rainbow Dash.
is dash going to be in it
yeah her full name IS Pinkamena Diane Pie
ofc'
unreliable narrator
Rainbow Dash is coming, they are just fixing her up
Rain: Yeah but it's easier to call happy one Pinkie and Cupcake one Pinkamena, for sake of ease.
Nittany_Discord, its because she is nowhere near done.
but everyone this calls her Pinkie for short
rain: YOUR LOGIC CANT HJARMME
Thanks for streaming Nittany_Discord
Nittany_Discord: likely she's the last to be completed
I wonder if one of the updates that comes out after it's released will include custom characters...
Did wrek ever finish his Rarity artwork
thanks again Nittany_Discord
Nittany_Discord the pegasi would take the most time mainly because of their feathers
yea , thnx for the stream Nittany_Discord
Malmortius: more than likely yes, he's very fast.
like how Applejack and Twilight were shown almost completed while Rarity and Pinkie didn't even have walk cycles yet.
RAWRity her and Fluttershy
thanks for streeming Nittany_Discord
*or
/me dusts Nittany_Discord.
...
I can't wait to see how they'll handle Fluttershy
Thank you for the always awesome stream Nittany_Discord. Have a good sleep!
11,01Sorry for the sound issues. I fought my audio repeater all night.
I still dont know where raritys name comes from. I understand where all the rest come from.
11,01First time I had to use one.
/me dusts Nittany_Discord's audio repeater
Nittany_Discord meh, I dont' mind
Malmortius, rare jems. :|
so. hmm...
WalkerPony89: she'll fight like that one character from BlazBlue, with a "summon" per se.
WalkerPony89: inb4 Flutter's stare is gamebreaking OP and she's banned from tournament play
/me hugs Nittany_Discord "It's okaay"
There hasent been much mention of gems where im up to ;p
Malmortius: a rarity is just that, something rare.
episode 11
Nittany_Discord: dont worry abut the sound the sterm was awesome enways sleep well
otakon: I've never played Blazblue, so I have no idea what you're talking about :P
RAWRity: Fluttershy is more likely to be planned from tourney's because no one wants to see her get beat on.
Yes otakon, but what does that have to do with raritys personality. Not that it has to, but it seems all the other names fit their character.
:(
Meanwhile: I'd beat the hell out of Fluttershy, honestly.
Malmortius when you say something's a rarity, it's extremely rare and high valued. The term is often used to describe jems
RAWRity: agreed.
WalkerPony89: well it's hard to explain, but she'll probably have a long range keep away character with long recovery times but high damage attacks.
GEMS
Lunar_Brony: it's GEMS
not jems
/me spins in circles :D
Jem was a bad cartoon from the 80's
otakon, I could care less
otakon correcting someones spelling. What alternate universe did I just fall into.
i plan on playing pinkie most
I'm not a moron i know what rarity means :(
otakon YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO USE THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE.
otakon: but she was truly, truly outrageous
Meanwhile: correct GabeMoist
otakon: Sounds like her kind of fighting style. If Fluttershy had to have one, that is
GabeMoist: couldn't*
Meanwhile: he said "I could care less" XP
Meanwhile in the Meanwhileverse
XD
Lunar_Brony: It's otakon, he always uses that voice
Spectrum_Rush|: That place would be horrible.
For example. rainbow dash, because shes quick and flys! Fluttershy, shes shy. But rarity? Hmm. Because.. she likes gems?
Ever noticed how all serial killers have three names? If you want your kids not to be serial killers, don't give them a middle name
WalkerPony89 well in that case, I'll have to use my secret weapon . . .
The Capitol Accent!
hen3ry: I have 2 middle names. ...welp.
hen3ry, also, most criminals drink water
we should ban water immediately
Yes! Ban water!
otakon, what, can you see into his head? Maybe he can care less. How would you know unless you were some sort of self obsorbed ass that can read minds
I'm naming my daughter Rarity. Its going to be awesome.
will the stream continue tonight, or later today? :S im heading to bed if not :)
Malmortius: she's a fashion designer whose big thing is using gems in her designs. She has an innate ability to find gems through magic.
i have 2 names and 2 last names ;o
T: well get you.
http://i781.photobucket.com/albums/yy97/Daisy8809/meanwhile_in_belgium.jpg
Oohh, that explains it otakon. the magic part of it.
Rain: no, grammatically "I could care less" is incorrect.
RAWRity: Mfw that linked pinged me.
Rain: that is what I was getting on about.
otakon: not if they're saying the COULD, in fact, care less.
We flourish evary word we say, and roll any hard "er" sounds. "Happy Hungah Games! And may the Odds be Evah in Youah Favah!"
Grammatically, you are being an ass.
that is what I was getting on about.
If you guys HAD to name one of your children after a pony, which would it be?
Lunar_Brony: how are ya lad
For instance, it's possible for me to care less about this chat, were I inclined to do so.
Luna
And the "could care less" discussion begins once again
Lyra.
Malmortius: Braeburn
Where's dari
Malmortius, that is easy, Sparkles Fantastic.
Rain: okay why is it when I correct someone I'm a ass, but no one says anything to Meanwhile when he undoubtedly corrects me?
GabeMoist: Opening things up massive. With leverage.
Seems to be the least teasing-potential name in the series so far xD
Malmortius: Mane 6? Because if it is restriced to Mane 6, then I hope to God my kid is a girl
How about derpy, rain.
otakon: Because I'm allowed.
Meanwhile: on what grounds and BEING BRITISH DOES NOT COUNT!
Because I havent seen Meanwhile do it.
Rain: you are blind then
otakon: On the grounds that you're always wrong.
Meanwhile: correct Rain
he does it at LEAST once a goddamn day whil I'm here.
So much hostility.
Spectrum_Rush|: About what.
Malmortius: Oh god...uh...
leave Rain Rain alone, otakon, or I'll tell shizu
scottish-geeky Oh deah, you sound an awful lot like Haymitch. Let me brighten you up a bit with spectaculah red lips and a matching nail polish. It's all the rave.
No, otakon, I just dont spend much time around here, because I start hating everyone.
otakon: Rain is rarely looking at the chat.
Meanwhile: she didn't use an apostrophe
otakon Meanwhile corrects everyone not only you :p
13rain rain~<3
Spectrum_Rush|: Didn't see, cba to look.
Spectrum_Rush| you can shove it.
Shizuka: otakon's being mean to Rain Rain
Stop arguing or ill have to talk about inappropriate things until i get banned.
And yeah, it's not just you otakon, it's just you /a lot/
:P
Malmortius: knock yourself out, hombre
Rain: well that sucks but the point is me jabbing fun at GabeMoist being incorrect in his usuage of the english language is nothing to get your knickers in a twis about eh?
OMFG I hate life....
Lunar_Brony: umjust be cus i wera a man skirt (kilt) dosint mean i do lipstick or nialspolish
oh hey Shizuka
I love you to Rain
MASF123: don't get mad, get glad.
MASF123: me to
RAWRity: .. maybe later. I like you guys really :(
otakon: usage* twist*
otakon, I was more making a joke about when you and dari were arguing over that phrase previously
THAT WAS A TYPO
GabeMoist: yh and I was wrong then.
I couldn't care less about people incorrectly saying that they could care less.
I do not know you, Spectrum_Rush| and have not once implied that I love you >:|
otakon: what's this about you putting knickers onto Twist?
GabeMoist: I conceded defeat and dammit I'll start using it correctly.
/me hides before the chat erupts into total warfare
RAWRity: I don't like where this is going.
/me drags AttacktheAndalite out
YOU'LL BE FINE!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBKBI7DOLHA
also, otakon, I will get my "knickers" in a twist whenever I damn well please.
/me clonks otakon with a cinderblock. "Stop capsing"
Rain: you're to serious, lighten up live a little, have fun
scottish-geeky I wasn't talking about that. At the veahy least, improve youah accent. It doesn't flow veahy well and sounds so rough.
Remember, last time we let the grammar nazis rule a country, bad things happened.
/me asks, "stream is ovah, just chat naow?"
Rain: ouch, doesn't it chafe to walk then?
Happy monday everyone~
:P
Spectrum_Rush|: Dude you are poking a tiger with a javelin, shush.
otakon: leave rain's knickers to his/her own business.
Meanwhile: :(
Her RAWRity
i didn't mean too
RAWRity is a her now?
Starflash Oh don't be silly, we 'aven't reached midnight yet.
and then my ignore list grew three sizes that day
Chat needs more Penn so I'll appropriately place this here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axWsbQhNCs0
Lunar_Brony: cus my accent is fake mah boi
no I'm telling RAWRity Rain is a her.
according to otakon
Oh ok.
is stream dead?
yes
AttacktheAndalite: lol
Meanwhile: haloween
and then Rain ignored me for God know's what.
I like Halloween to.
otakon: It'd be presumputious to assume she's ignoring you.
I'mma go get cereal
hadnt gotten to you yet, otakon, but Im working my way there.
Told you so.
lovely, see?
AttacktheAndalite that was veahy rude of you to interrupt this friendly conversation with yoah profanitay.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=fvwrel&NR=1&v=Rai9SiBRv50
hen3ry That has got to be the most idiotic idea I've ever read. LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPEN GUYS!
cratorkid: who is that?
Capitol_Accent: One, I didn't say it, Mr. Penn did.
Ryunosuke: only because of marketing. I'm waiting for it to start on Labor Day, personally.
I think im going to go now: night everypony.
otakon: no fking clue
Capitol_Accent: Two, I sense the chat might end up in flames so...
unless you've already ignored me, I am sorry Rain
hen3ry, why wait, just make it a year round thing :)
i'd like to celebrate hallowen ... free candy :p too bad in here we only have the "day of the dead" but the food for that one is so good :p
Riiight...so I'll be going now. Not in a good mood. So See you all tomorrow.
Probably the BEST YouTube comment of all time: http://cheezburger.com/6447562496
g'night Dovah. And may the odds by evah in youah favah!
/me leaves
Night, MASF123
oooooh.
Halloween is the only time I can creep around bushes at night carrying smoke bombs without seeming out of place.
http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/528980_392688727447345_1169001288_n.jpg
RAWRity: HA
RAWRity: i see waht u did there
Meanwhile: Halloween is the only time I can stalk people without getting arrested.
AttacktheAndalite oh, you should 'ave seen Katniss at the Seventy-Fouath Hungah Games! She is "The Girl On Fiah"
Eddmario: no u just need to be carful
RAWRity: I don't get it...
RAWRity: i hate those plastic tubes
Halloween is the only time I can stake people without getting... no wait, 2007, I forgot.
otakon: it's a series of tubes.
Capitol_Accent: Niiice. I need to re-read the books. I only read the first one, though
Eddmario: you've never cut the corners of your mouth on those freezie pop tubes before have you?
Scissors man, scissors.
Meh, Hunger Games is okay, though I felt Catching Fire had a big problem of just being padding until we could get to the twist ending...which I saw coming from all the way back in the 5 chapter.
otakon: Nope, because i'm not an idiot.
Hahahahaha
That is the best answer.
Eddmario: What are you talking about, EVERYONE does.
there is a fine, fine line between genius and idiocy. Or is that sanity, I forget...
I always waited a few minutes so they'd melt a bit and suck up the juice
Eddmario: yh, now. how about when you were 6?
Eddmario: ...Then why freeze them?
Eddmario: well that just defeats the purpose of freezin it in the first place
AttacktheAndalite Using the Capitol Accent around others can be somewhat difficult in text, but if two tributes from District Twelve can win the Hungah Games, I guess anything is possible! Except an uprising, that's just prepostrous!
I'm awake at 7:30AM talking about freeze pops. I've lost control of my life.
Derpdash, RAWRity: I said a BIT, not all the way. Geeze, make sure you read something fully before you comment on it...
. . . why is my name Capitol_Accent?
Meanwhile: took you awhile to realize that.
Much bettah
Eddmario: Ahh...
hial Scotland
Hi everybody! ... so, was there movies played today?
otakon: In my defense I've been having fun in chat.
Meanwhile, such is life on Bronystate
Dr_Fumbles: There was not.
Dr_Fumbles not today, come back next week
*weekend
phew... thx
GabeMoist: Only when it's calmed down a bit, too many people usually.
You know it's true: http://cheezburger.com/6443004160
Oh, and I also hate thos annoying plastic tubes
You know what tastes good? Put a popsicle in the mirowave, melt it and drink the liquid
hen3ry Wrong tab I take it?
Eddmario I simply cannot stand this tension! Waiting for something is such a ridiculous thought, I want it NAAAAHHHHWWW.
this chat needs some De La Soul http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3kgjzUsDeg
meeeeebe.
Hey did the weather stop talking?
So... is everyone buffering, or just me?
Capitol_Brony: Here, have a YouTube comment to hold you over. http://cheezburger.com/6447562496
What are you talking about?
Dr_Fumbles: Nothing's on atm.
Dr_Fumbles: Just you. We're watching the Gray and White show!
6_9
We're watching episode 4786 of the Buffer Show, Bronystate's most popular program
Eddmario That was quite clevah, if I do say so mahself.
This is the most boring game of Snake I've ever seen...
The circle... it speaks to me...
/me sits next to Meanwhile and leans on his shoulder
This whole season of the Buffer Show is overrated. I swear the writers phoned it in.
inb4 Mips does what YT did and makes the buffeer circle into a Snake game
inb4 STREAM!!
I love this part
hen3ry: But when the show ended, you fealt like you connected with it
hen3ry: A lack of creativity on their part. Such a shame.
Actually I felt very disconnected.
This part makes me crai ev3ry time :'(
As if they somehow just weren't reaching me.
and now, the Doctor Who anime http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt3qZYUPi2Y
Even the Fifty-Sevahnth Hungah Games were more intahresting than this.
Once upon a time, in the magical land of Bronystate. There was a buffer. And it buffered until the seasons changed, and the lakes dried, and life ceased to exist, and after the barren ball of rock that was a planet was consumed by the fire of it's nearest star, scattering the ash across the universe in a wave unfelt by the galaxy. And legend has it, that on the fringe of existence, it still
buffers.
hn3ry: Well, at least they had the finale include an uncensored, unedited, unadulterated lesbian sex orgy
RAWRity, The whatnow?
Eddmario: ... dem spoilers...
Yes, best doctor
I haven't a response to that.
Eddmario: I don't even
scuse me, I need to find summink to wipe the drool off my face with...
hen3ry: Guess what? It turned out one of the women was a hermaphrodite, and ended up getting one of the other women pregnant
.. and to barf in.
Eddmario: Wait, how can they show that on cable TV?
Something clearly went wrong in chat while I was typing that...
If you look real closely, you can see that there is no video playing
hen3ry Oh deah, not in here boy! This is mahogany!
you're not thinking 4th dimensionally, Dr_Fumbles!
Meanwhile in the chat ehile Meanwhile was typeing
*while
AttackAndalite: You got it on cable? I thought they only were allowed to have it On Demand...
hen3ry: OF COURSE!
but yeah, apparently some industrious Whovians made Dr. Who anime video
Eddmario: I have satellite
Meanwhile: did i ever tell ya i love your nick choice :p
RAWRity, it seems quite impressive so far
Spectrum_Rush|: You did not.
Meanwhile: well i do
Spectrum_Rush|: <3
If you think about it, right now, someone is having sex
Meanwhile: <3
statistically speaking, those someones include your mom.
Eddmario: And someone else is eating a doughnut, what's your point.
OH SHNAP
I'm waiting for the Quarter Quell. Foahty-eight tributes last time. Now THAT was intahresting.
Meanwhile, and someone else is up at 4 in the morning making chocolate pudding because they've lost control of their life
Eddmario: Please don't say that. It might actually be happening now....unfortunately she talks about it
Meanwhile: And the catergory is, stuff Bronysith is doing right now.
No, the answer is not "light urple."
Eddmario: Boring someone to death?
otakon did you fall asleep or something?
no
[You need a BronyState Gold Accoutn to view this comment]
I'm sitting in front on my computah while displaying my use of the Capitol Accent through typing. It is not as easy as you may considah it to be.
Talk more, I miss correcting you.
[ERROR: anvklaew9o8$vnq#

[This comment is still buffering. Please stand by.]
[Purple]
RAWRity: it sure did
[This will nevah be populah]
/me can think of a few days she wants to do right now
things*
Thursday is always a great day to do...
oh
I like to do Friday
and then THIS made a very good case for scrapping the whole "ash as the hero" thing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2SA4GyXb2U&feature=related
Friday's so lazy. She just lays back and expects you to do all the work...
I like trains.
I meant things. Days came out by accient.
RAWRity: Inb4 eventually Ash is an old man in Gen like...37
Ash? A hero? lol
This Spy Aria: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkGwqsrfEeI&feature=plcp
AttacktheAndalite: Sure, you did. ;D
Meanwhile: inb4 ash is still 10 in gen 37
RAWRity, Pokemon Special might've made a good Pokemon anime
/me yawns
Next season, he'll be 9
Spectrum_Rush|: Actually I did.
I'm sick of the Capitol Accent.
GabeMoist: I really, REALLY wish they had gone the route of the manga, and every new gen had a new protagonist.
Anyone play PMD?
Dr_Fumbles wut?
What's PMD?
I was hoping someone would know...
my brain is operating on %01 maximum capacity
pokemon mystery dungeon
As always.
01% ?
IDC
Spectrum_Rush|: Thank You
:)
Then no, I have not
Why the hell did they skip gen 5?
I have never played a Pokemon game
in my entire life
We couldn't handle 100%, Lunar_Brony. No one could. It'd be like suddenly having Derp-o-vision.
i love this pic http://derpy.me/eqa61
blasphemous :O
hen3ry it would be a change of scenery . . .
Very Day of the Dead.
buck it. I'm too tired to care
If you borrowed my brain, it'd be like, dude, that's creepy.
. . . why am I still wearing this wooden tie?
If you borrowed my brain, I would die
yep pretty much
Dude, that stuff is awesome.
Lunar_Brony: Wha... I don't even...
Can a vegetarian cannibal eat people who are in a persistant coma?
seriously, I'm wearing a Dress Shirt, Dress Pants, and a Wooden Tie
you don't want to borrow my brain...
Well, I'd show everyone what I've found to be the rival to the rapping dog, but... Wow it's bad.
/me groans in boredom. "I need chocolate, like now"
/me throws chocolate chips muffins at AttacktheAndalite
happy?
AttacktheAndalite: Did you say... Chocolate? .... CHOCOLATE!?
/me eats the muffins "Yes and no. Yes because it's something. No, because I don't have much money on me"
AttacktheAndalite they're free
Chocolate does nothing for me. Not enough oestrogen receptors I guess.
I don't require the nourishment of food
White Chocolate is delicious
I agree
so, you guys know how Digimon's anime was infinitely better than Pokemon's?
it's not even chocolate
RAWRity: except that movie
otakon: that movie was Fox's fault.
RAWRity: When it got around to Wargreymon power bombing everyone, yeah.
otakon so? It's made from cocoa butter, which is from the cocao bean
RAWRity: Doesn't say much, Pokemon sucked
and it tastes good
so STFU
Lunar_Brony: still not chocolate

Could be worse, you know. Some things are scary when fed after midnight. Like babies. :/
Lunar_Brony: same here
otakon: I should, because I've gained weight from it. But I get hungry sometimes after midnight and I'm out of PopTarts
8,6:p
Polydunami: shame thats for shamefull pepol

I'm gonna hit they hay. G'night everypony
Oh. That's sad :(
AttacktheAndalite: go out and hunt a squirrel
Night, Lunar_Brony
Pfft. What'd he get banned for?
Also, Moopy is unbanned. Dunno if that's good or bad.
Squirrels are so gamey.
8,6being a jackass
RAWRity: 1) Don't know how to hunt. 2) It's nearly 3am
AttacktheAndalite: go to bed earlier OR stop snacking.
Of course.
I like Deer Chops
good eating
AttacktheAndalite: all the better! the squirrels will never see it coming.
8,6used gigabit's run last night to crank call people, as soon as I saw that he was gone
also, Shiro Pony FTW
I'm gonna hit the hay guys, later
I forgot to log on today :S
otakon: Well, I've gotten adapted to stay up till 4am because all the classes I've had run from 6pm to 10:30pm, 11 at the latest
dat schedule. I has a jealous.
Oh dear
so am i the only metal head here
oh did saw him saying that, but did not saw the ban
That guy never was that sharp, figured it was only a matter of time 'till he did something properly stupid.
last way longer than i expected
scottish-geeky: Nope!
RAWRity: Woah...I mean, you pinged me out of my daydream for that?
WalkerPony89: (\
I occasionally enjoy metal, but I find a lot of it to be tired and monotonous
scottish-geeky: /)
I've got another year ahead of 8 am classes. Snot cool.
Agreed actually, I thought he was toast about five minutes after he showed up.
I dunno about that, scottish-geeky http://tinyurl.com/c3uu796
Polydunami: o har har
8,6yeah, except other than being annoying he wasn't breaking any rules
I'm tired and slightly buzzed :P
3AM here
Yeah but generally those're the sort who do something stupid quickly.
Polydunami: ok
8,6he's been around before I'm pretty sure, but it was a couple of months back I think
Your friend is fucking crazy :D
RAWRity, that's awesome
RAWRity: Someone should hire your friend to do artwork, man
AttacktheAndalite: that was actually a commission.
Suddenly, aï»¿ wild chess game appearsââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ
scottish-geeky: Pawn to rook 3.
and IRL it's on a poster-board sized piece of paper
worst chess board ever
Meanwhile: lol
8,6don't spam symbols scottish-geeky
Meanwhile: that's an awful move
mfw my computer recognised all those chess characters :O
And then :3
kirzstryfe: sary did not mean to spam just thot it was funny
Polydunami: lols

RAWRity: You're an awful move. Actually I don't even know how the 3 part works anyway.
RAWRity: Your friend is awesome. I know he probably has a giant stash of colored pencils at all times
og it works
8,6-.-
Pfft.
Gentlemen and Ladies I regret to inform you this is the end. I must be going, I am late. I've stayed for far too long I'm afraid. Goodbye!
8,6yes, ctrl+v works :p
I want to play chess now. :I
oh relax kyrz this room is way more dead
/me waves goodnight to chat.
G'Night otakon
Meanwhile: it would be the third space on the rook's row. So you'd be moving the pawn forward one space.
otakon: There's nothing to correct on there.
I'm late, I'm late for a very important date!
nite otakon sleep well
which accomplishes NOTHING
Night otakon
nite otakon
Polydunami: no
RAWRity: Very true. thinking about it, I meant Knight anyway.
Reminded me of Alice :S
RAWRity, maybe that's his plan
GabeMoist: it's still a terrible opener
No time to say hello, Goodbye!, I'm late I'm late I'm late
holy fuck thats a lot http://www.ebay.com/itm/NES-ACTION-SET-OFFICIAL-SYSTEM-BRAND-NEW-RARE-Original-Nintendo-Deck-/221074840602?pt=Video_Games&hash=item3379165c1a
RAWRity, exactly, your opponent will think that and think you're bad and let their guard down
You kidding me!?
ehh to bad can't place them right :p
Unopened and all?
8,6well, newsletter is done after 4 hours and it's way too early, so time for sleep :)

G'night kirz
fuck fuck fuck how tdo i fix my bloody hihat
me is pissed off
GabeMoist: not if they're a good player.
well make a youtube playlist instead :p
First rule of chess is to always assume your opponent will make the best possible move.
8,6have a few already from the request nights, but a few of those are meh for my tastes
i yhougt it was " don't do anything stupid"
thougt*
Go to bed already. :P
RAWRity, and they'll assume you make the best possible moves, so you respond by making the worst possible moves
GabeMoist: except then they've got the advantage
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbLEJP5ZzIk&feature=related
METAL
hahaha xD
who wants a massive bronystae skype party?
bronystate*
that's like saying "I'm fighting an expert martial artists, so I'll fight by pretending to have a seizure! That'll throw them off!"
RAWRity, that's when you get the upper hand by setting the chess board on fire
[wklmjhe]JRP2234: bad idea
no its not
LIES
LIESSSSSSSSSSS
GabeMoist: but then your time runs out on your clock and you lose by default
they won't be able to move their pieces because of the flames
GabeMoist: chess in hell

Yes?
I'm planning on making a web page where I would do reviews of anime and video games
Ok
Phase4 nice :D
I just want to know what people think. I'm hoping to use it as an extra source of revenue if I get enough visitors to make money from ads.
Sounds like a very intresting idea to me
Ohai Bronystate!

Implying if you don't want to support said dev
If you enjoy your work, make it into an art!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxi_MxZBNLQ
Saints Row The Third has too much money as it is
Vordox: That's actually quite creative
I'll torrent if the game's purpose is mainly the campaign
killerpony7733: You make work fun. :) Noone else
Anyting else and a no-no
Eh i stand by the fact i pay for my games, I know full on what i'm doing with them and where they go.
yes
I pay for my games
hey everypony :)
I only pirate if they are drowning in money
Though Pwnies i can understand if you want a game from your childhood that isn't anywhere to be found
hm out of space? a) clean up b) insert additional harddisks
like Dead Islam. Saints Row The Boat. Or Super Meat COck
wish I could to b) on my laptop..

Anyhow bye guys
Hydrophobia is an extreme or irrational fear of water, esp. as a symptom of rabies in humans.

/me hugs Vordox
It takes time to make a unique animation and desktop pony for each mod
So far 6 are done
just take a regular desktop pony, change colours, done. thats the cheat way
d3rb: I don't work like that, d3rb =P
:D
i know you dont, yours are very good
A sec
Yea, but I want mine to actually do something related to me, like play a video game :P
Recolours are a little below the ponycreator in terms of originality.
lol i never said it was a good way to make em, just a quick way
lol dat bird
Hmmm...maybe it's about time I actually register the domain for the website I plan on making.
OtakuTom what is that website about? ^^
looks like a glider
I plan on making a site where I do reviews of anime and video games.
Mmmm.....i wub muffins <3
ded
That thing is fucked.
OtakuTom: Well if you haven't noticed..
All animations I do mostly are unique :p
http://img839.imageshack.us/img839/6375/compuv.png
Yea, I noticed that, Vordox :P
There
Vordox: Wow
:O
Guess which is which :P
Also
I didn't want to bother you about them, 'cause I knew you were making them for the mods.
I need to remodel Phase4's OC to make him more pony
I know 3 of them right away.
I know Wrek, Sumi, and Phase, 'cause I'm always around when they stream.
They are the only ones that can use their stream for their OC
:D
nilla, wrek, sumi, phase, scoots, nittany,
00,02dat vi oc
The other 3...I wouldn't know off the top of my head, but I have some ideas
Nittany and Scootaloo and Violet Vanilla....They have issues with their computers
Vordox: Do i win?
ah
Yeah you won killerpony7733 :P
What does i get? :3
But yeah Phase4
Vivi on the left Phase4 on top Wrek in middle Sumica on right Scoot-Scootaloo in corner cold frost nittany bottom Vordox
I'll remodel your OC next time i get around to hi
him
Spectrum_Rush|AFK: Yep
Vordox: :O usrs?
Spectrum_Rush|AFK: Sounds like a description of the worlds most unbalanced orgy,
Meanwhile: it does doesn't it
killerpony7733: Of course, my goal to try and not be bored of spriting before all mods have atleast 3 unique animations :L)
:)
So far, Wrek is the only one totally done
Heck, he has 10 animations
/outofcontext ^
More then enough
Phase4, this is not how you stay away from steam and save money :|
Vordox that sounds like a whole load of work doing an animation
And then also
We have this offshot

Vordox: Bronysith!
A sec, let me show you Nittany's ONLY FRIGGING animation
Dat kick
This is Nittany's ONLY animation
So i 've arrived at a mention of 'unbalanced orgy'...
"Create a tornado"
http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/6118/feedbackf.jpg
All those "borders" are one frame each
Vordox no dusting? :D
Invi: Dusting?
Vordox: Nittany dusts a lot.
Invi: Oh that's later on for his Nittany's OC
thats awesome Vordox. alot of work
NIttany has 2, Nittany and Cold Front
d3rb: I only sprite when I have the itch =P
Vordox: you should do those on commission, you'd get swamped.
Meanwhile: Swamped?
LAWL
You have NO idea how many projects I'm juggling atm. :
:P
Vordox: The swamp has been doubled.
Meanwhile: Yeah, and not to mention my current economy is making me only eat each other day
=P
Until College begins again
should makew that another project, learn to juggle for real
So everyyone here aiming to join the 16 mile club?
d3rb: After I got my Rhythm is Magic to work
Or "work better"
00,02YES
00,02i did it
did what Phase4?
I just wish...
http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/4609/sumicafeedback2.png <--- If I only could break the DP sprite rules
00,02with fuel to spare
ah... i dont understand at all :P
00,02enough to possibly make orbit
/me can't hear the engines...
oH YEAH....
what rules Vordox ?
ohh now i get it
00,02Mutterguy, they're off :P
Spectrum_Rush|AFK: Desktop Ponies sprites has "rules"
mornin ponies~
k
On how they must be made
how many rules?
d3rb: Firstly, Only 2x2 cubes
(One example of this rule broken is Octavia's sprite and S2 Luna)
Where they use smaller pixels in bigger works
:p
that butt hurt feel
what unit does the 2x2 refer to>
Vordox: s2 luna always did look a bit weird to me
Spectrum_Rush|AFK: It's the hair
O.o
http://img705.imageshack.us/img705/2747/sumicafeedback.png <--- This I love doing, recreating the "body" with no fill colours, make it look awesome.
Vordox: wait wouldn't that mean Celestia broke the rules to?
Spectrum_Rush|AFK: Haven't seen that.
DO A BARREL ROLL
it must be damn close if it doesnt, shes as big as luna
Vordox: really?, she part of standard DT ponies
You know this is way more epic with Power Ranger theme songs in the background.
So s Octavia
But meh, It's more of a "preference" now
Vordox: the cello right?
As long as it's not overdone, it's fine
Phase4: Is that kerbins version of australia your landing at? :O
Spectrum_Rush|AFK: The arm holding the string instrument to the Cello
00,02not sure
Check the pixels there
00,02dont think kerbin has an australia
Please, Tuiles theme fits this nicely.
Guiles*
just look for a bunch of kerbin doing burnout in a commodor while drinking beer, thats kerbin australia
nah you want the theme bristish airlines used to use
But yeah, I've been doing sprites for about..
errr...
First time I ever made a sprite I think I was 8...
And then kept it as a hobby.
wow
So now I'm 27 so about 20 years. :P ish
Inb4 Vordox takes an apprentice when he's 60.
"Back in my day we didn't have holodeck sprites"

I should probably make GL2 true sometimes in the future... If I ever get interest to it again. >.> http://img243.imageshack.us/img243/6937/lydiaconcept9.png
Phase4: Well it's a remote island so lets call it australia anyway?

MadSurge i couldnt find Kerbal Space Program on steam :(
it isn't. just google it
Derpdash: ask Phase4 then, I dunno :(
Yea, it's not on Steam.
oh ty OtakuTom
You can either google search, or just go to kerbalspaceprogram.com
i swear this is why i don't use image editing software ... i have no idea how to use SAI, inkscape, GIMP or photoshop ._.
Kerbal Space Program is on the pirate bay for both mac and PC.
T: Beware layers.
Meanwhile i would be more scared if i knew how to add them in the first place
i need to find a guide for this thing
T: "Add layer"
oh this puzzle game would hurt my head -
^
this is a weird game
LSD the game :D
It's almost like I'm on acid.
00,02shrooms

The fact that I have killed two LARGE spiders already tonight is not helping me watch this game.

*shutters*
What kind of spiders?
lol dat mousetrololololol
I have no idea. I think they're cane spiders.
.-.
i hate ALL spiders
Me too. Insects are the one thing that just scare the crap out of me no matter how old I get.

At least I have balls enough to kill them now.
except rolypolys
those are fucking awesome
:D the music
WTF <<<<<
Well there are a lot of bugs that desipte being scary are still cool as shit.
Ilchymis: yeah true
eh....those tree-vein things are disturbing

xD
That's great. An all A cappella would make me smile.
A cappella game*
well is someone would ding instead of doing these noises... :D
*sing
And would that not be really cool?
Phase4 notice how those ameobas thinsgs have 1, 2, 3 eyes

Chrysalis: You play tribes ascend?

00,02if that was a conversation
I guess how the game mechanics works puts some off
00,02why were they facing foward
*In-Game Logic Fail*
Phase4: Please try to save malik here,
BOOM
you can actually save her here
but its damn hard
Depends on your firepower
shes dead
you NEED to kill the guy with the gas grenade
or shes as good as dead
Damn
He may not have enough firepower to beat them all in time
Phase4 go for the guy with the gas greneade shes dead if it goes off
killerpony7733 most of them dont actually do that much damage
guys who here knows stuff about kittens?
Let me guess, she's vital for the no-kill run?
Not really,
not vital for it
but shes been so much help
But you get alot of xp
Aps: yo.
Uhhh
DED
Meanwhile, can u give a kitten cows milk
Phase4: Use explosive crate on the bot
00,02i'm realy not setup for this kind of combat
Aps: No.
Well you can try
Meanwhile, k
But explosives crates are there as a option
00,02i cant remember which button it is though

SEA PONIES
Lil_B: xD
hey has anyone been watching doctor whooves and derpy
:D
Me
MadSurge lets all call upon the Sea-Horses XD
I have pony_9695
^^
God that's awesome
More or less here
you mean the audio series?
Confound these keyboards, they drive me to cut off human fingers!
Lil_B: Shoo be doo!
The animated episodes is up to two episodesright?
it needs to be its own show
MadSurge call upon the seapony when you're in Distress
Hey, dudes! :)
yup, max
MegaMoonShine: Oi
What needs to be its own show?
Heya MegaMoonShine :)
MegaMoonShine!
doctor whooves and derpy
:O
Dr.whooves , i think it would make an awesome episode atleast
/me hugs killerpony7733 MaxTheBrony and DB_Brony
:D
confound these alarms! the drive me to run!
Yeah, that would be a great series
/me hugs megamoonshine back
two characters that we created
/me hugs MegaMoonShine ^^
the possabilities
well we half created Dr. Whooves
we named him
We as in the brony community right=
?
00,02hack so hard i get achive
i think they should have a Dr. Whooves episode in season 3
Not exactly' We named them due to the resemblence to a certain show and the other due to the internet
Derpdash: It still not to late for that :3
and it has Dr. Who references and such
yeah. we = brony community.
what the difference
*whats
pony_9695: Fanon vs Canon=canon wins
DerpDash, i think the only thing stopping them from that is copyrights
killer, yes
they were even cautious about using "Dr. Whooves" as a name.
Nothing else in the world matters when i have a new chapter of Vinyl and Octavia: University Days to read.
bitch plz hasbro doesnt need to start a doctor whooves thing
we already did that
:O)==, I have a Pinkie Pie Launcher, oyur argument is invalid.
^^
I mean the fanon vs canon thing extends to as far as how people think having a alicorn OC is ok
Hasbro is an independent black woman who don't need no man
:D
:P)== BITCH! DERP LAUNCHER READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
hell we could fix it up here and watch doctor whooves on this website
if we asked for it
00,02i have zero darts :(
Only Lauren Faust is allowed to have an alicorn OC :D
DB_Brony: Lets just call a truce and eat muffins, shall we?
pony_9695: You mean the fan made episodes?
sure
yeah, but those are made by just one guy and therefore they take a while to make
MadSurge: Yeah only allowed alicorn besides canon alicorns
I litterally facehoof everytime i hear or see a alicorn OC
DerpDash: waaay ahead of you
and with some more views and a little sponsering we can really do this
00,02well
00,02i'm screwed
killerpony7733: I know that feel
Phase4: Should've done a barrel roll...:'(
well....unscrew yourself
killerpony7733: i dunno, nyx is pretty cute too but i totally agree
sorry that's all i got
pony_9695: Well no, Cause one thing is bronystate can't take money in anyway due to copyright things and what not
damnit, the bass is to strong for my tiny PC Speakers :(
RoboGerbil: Nyx+
?*
I like Nyx too :)
hi everypony!
Hi nipa_
hey, nipa_
no u mis understand, we already have people making episodes
: D
hey nipa_ how've you been
hi nipa_ :)
they just arent well animated
:O I got the planet side Beta :D
but we could fix that
hi nipa_
pony_9695: You do realise money doesn't exactly solve that? the issue is more the skill of the animators and what not
yes destroy the walls
pony_9695: if the team at studio B could work on it.
how far into the game is this?
Smash the system! fight the power! What are we talking about?!
Phase4 - Punching holes in walls since whenever the fuck he felt like it
hahaha
Yes money gives them more free time to make them, But hardly helps them animate better
well thats where the money comes in
money is everything!
we pitch in and try and fund a animation team
an*
Plus possible chance of getting sued by hasbro for taking money to make something that is MLP FIM
trust me there are many bronies out there with the skill
If the following word begins with a vowel the connective is an.
its basically avertisment
No advertising in chat
why would they sue
Meanwhile but there are still some words where its strange, our english teacher said that it can be confusing in rare situations
But the thing that stops them is hasbro being able to sue them for using and making MLP FIM content etc
....Sometimes....I like to catch furry things with my arse cheeks
wut.
O__________0
Lil_B: Some situations can be confusing in letters but it's largely about the sound produced.
:P
and accepting money for it too
00,02y u no recharge more than one battery :<
Meanwhile lets just stick with the Poor Literacy is Cewl method :P
00,02its incredibly anoying
Lil_B: Nein!
Phase4: Cause badly thought of mechanics
Meanwhile DOCH!
well think of it like this. we pitch in our own money to pay for something that is almost like advertisement for them
...yes
00,02killerpony7733, no, i think it works fine
00,02but it should recharge more than one
why in the hell would they sue us for that
Isn't there already the thankyou project for that?
pony_9695: Copyright laws, and the fact they are the only ones mean't to be able to make money from it etc
and we wouldnt get any profit from it, we would just be creating a good show
00,02how convenient that this guy stands on THIS part of THIS wall while smoking
00,02meens i can do this
pony_9695: are we still talking about the dr.whooves thing?
xD
yes
05the mechanic would be completly acceptable had it recharged atleast 2, or all but very slowly
crush him
I have no idea /what/ we're talking about. I've just stopped playing LoL.
ded
Heya Wrek
Poor guy he just wanted lung cancer :'(
and Heya Meanwhile
pony_9695: Accepting money of any kind to create something that has a copyright law on it and has not any permission to make said content from said show you can get your ass sued
hi there wrek
what doctor whooves thing exactly? did i miss something?
Ohai Wrek :)
Is it me or is chat rather laggy atm?
Dark_Horst: Funding one and what not and how laws stop any way of funding a animation team from making them more frequently
killerpony7733: there is always the possibilit of completely unrelated donations
How do you know if its lagging Meanwhile
killerpony7733: so, who's wanting to fund hwat?
Meanwhile: must be you, chat's fine for me
MaxTheBrony: Mostly the sudden surge of messages every so often.
Ah
Dark_Horst: No no no the general idea of donating money for a team of animators to make fanmade episodes for dr.whooves for example
MaxTheBrony: partly because a message pops up saying "lag"
hasbro is a kind and smart company, our funding would be for our self satisfaction. if they were to sue us then they would sue every one doing the same god damn thing im talking about
:P
killerpony7733: okay then
Are you still talking about Dr.Whooves O.o?
on youtube i mean
Dude that was like 10 minutes ago?
I recall reading somewhere that under certain conditions Hasbro would be forced to take legal action to maintain control of their IP. Can't remember what it was though.
that door seems interesting
Is Phase going for no kill playthrough?
pony_9695: You do not know how a corperation works do you?, if someone seriously attempts to get funding or donations that involves money to make a actual type of episode or something they will do something about it
you know, pepsing a single guy might be considered a litte overkill
one thing i don't get about hasbro though is why they don't use the youtube feature
how would they possibly do that. buy some how tracing where all the money came from
Any corperation with a copyright on certain things will do everything to avoid anyone from profitting from their content
is that sumica playing?
fuck it to hell
busting my balls
so would the brony documentry john de lacies doing fall under this killerpony7733
they have done the animation already and they didnt get sued
Dark_Horst: No it's phase
alexxm: Explain please,
what im saying is we help make the animation better
If we give critique yes
lol, dude got resist augs
therefore giving us a better youtube show
killerpony7733 sorry i was unsure if de lancie was making money off of it?
pony_9695: The thing is hasbro will easily find out if a project with a team to make fanmade MLP FIM episodes are being funded by people
alexxm: Well if it's free thats alright, If it's not i still believe he can easily have gotten permission to do it
ok then
no what they will find out is that a skill full animator with a nice pay cheak made a glorious youtube show
00,02no fair
i hate the ai of the enemies in this game
theyre so...
00,02Realy no fair
robotic
pony_9695: As i said as long as no one funds them or donates money to them, and it's all made for free nothing is being broken. But if they are then hasbro will try to sue them
they must have some kind of emp dampening in there
He should have gotten a stun gun due to how good it is
He has one
but he prob got no ammo
I've been watching this discussion for several minutes and I still don't know what the basis of it is.
00,02Y U FAIL ME PEPS
why if they are the ones who benefit from the free advertisement, you see youtube isnt just intertanment its also the biggest advertisement network ever
heh
lol
they wouldnt see it as copy right just more as a fanmade parody
imean not as a copyright
pony_9695: That's just non related profit, They get it cause of adverts on the video else it's not a direct profit that comes only because of the video
so thats how they will see this show
wtf?
You know what i can't wait for?
i mean shed.mov and all that shit is well animated and they have a whole season
Another Gigabit stream.
no law sues
He is awesome.
XAX: Same here
i agree XAX
pony_9695: it's non profit and would probably fall under fair use
shed.mov is disturbing though
Guys, Hasbro probably won't sue anyone for fanmade content with or without money. they haven't been doing that with artist commisions, so why start and in the process take a chance at losing a large part of your audience
^
thank you brony
Well look at bronystate they can't take money or anything due to copyright
That being said, hasbro DOES HAVE THE RIGHT to sue others for making moneywith fanmade content
Do Bronystate need money?
THATS BECAUSE BRONY HANDLES WITH REAL EPISODES
Bronystate get's paid in hugs
MaxTheBrony: They always could, But they can't take it even if they wanted
the have to be careful with that
Im sure "you" can donate to this site :O Why wouldnt it be possible?
00,02y u guys no stand together
05killerpony7733: you got it all wrong.
05we could always charge and accept money
05but it wouldnt be legal
05but we could
05the point here is
05we dont
what wrek said.
05casue we aint greedy fucktards
Wrek: Yes, and thats my point
But if we want to donate Can we do it?
no bwrek we arent being greedy
MaxTheBrony: As he said yes, But due them not wanting it and the law possibly coming down on them no
allright :)
we are tring to see if starting a derpy and doctor whooves would work out
i say it could be promising
Pony_9695 it has allready started , and it does work
:)
pony_9695: But the overall point i'm making is it's a god damn scary minefield of copyright and laws
I have a question. If all you guys did were gaming and art streams could you in that case accept money legally?
Do something wrong and you are sure to get in trouble
00,02STAND TOGETHER DAMNIT
DB_Brony: I thought that too , because ppl on twitch and others can be donated too
yes but cant we just try plus hasbro has always sided with the fans
DB_Brony: As it funds the site and what is being streamed which has copyright i do not think so,
05you could donate to us if you wanted as we are already now
05but the thign is
05we dotn accept donations
why would they disagree and sterr up it all up
D:
killerpony7733: but what part about gaming and art would be copyright?
O.o Be right back gotta Try PlanetS2
DB_Brony: I said if it funds the site, Then it's around the no part. If it just funds the person with what they make and what not maybe
they still havent sued youtube and theres so much copy right in there already
05that is where you are wrong killer
Wrek: Explain it to me
how would this show be different
pony_9695: because all that copyright content on youtube is illegal
On what days do they send the newsletter?
05streaming games and art on twitch for an example does not collide with the copyright law. streaming a movie does becasue it was covered under the copyright law. games were not (which they try to change now but fail)
really but yet they have not been sued
and so would be the show....if the creators monotized off of it
05so i can stream my lets play of X game and accept donations which could be used to fun anything.
and the postman just delivered Â£13000 worth of paper to my house
awesome
Thanks for answering my question Wrek :)!
00,02Y U MAKE NONLEATHLE SO HARDE
00,02:<
D:
Chrysalis: with a Truck?! Or Gold Paper?
brony you are making it seem like you dont trust hasbro to much
Wrek: That makes sense, Kinda where i was pointing to actually. Just that it can end up colliding funding the site directly and since it does stream copyrighted material
On what days do they send the newsletter?
Chrysalis: O.o why?
they arent a bunch of sue hapy freaks you know
ded
MaxTheBrony my University certificate just arrived
Chrysalis: Nice :)
yup
Chrysalis: on what? :)
Masters Degree in Computer Science with Games Development
Chrysalis: You had me thinking a truck dropped off Â£13000 of plain A4 paper.
pony_9695: why don't you just ask hasbro if it is ok to do X
:O
XAX, it would take several trucks for that much paper
Chrysalis: Awesome :)
get permission from the legal department and your ready to go
Pony_9695: I know and I pointed that out, it's just that they have the right to sue and sometimes that's a possibility you don't want to take.
Chrysalis: :O my favorite kind of egghead! :$
shana im sorry but im not on speaking terms with hasbro
what with being an anon and all
Implying Hasbro speaks to you.
Like the voice of god.
pony_9695: yeah I mean if we're talking about funding a team or something
xD
00,02dats enough deus ex for now
What is thy bidding oh Hasbro
Wrek: But yeah it's a minefield with it comes to copyrights and law.
+Phase4 thanks for streaming it :)
"Make more playsets
something makes me think that meanwhile is the voice of god...
Hasbro ha spoken.
Chrysalis sounds good, where did you study it? There is nothing around here where you can Study something like this
University of Hull, UK
hasbro would simple shrug it off as a fan made series
DB_Brony: God must be a miserable bugger.
no sueing what so ever
OBOY
pony_9695 it depends
theres laws which means that if they are informed in a certain way
they have no choice but to sue
KSP! KSP!
pony_9695: you don't know that
shana when has hasbro proved me wrong
pony_9695: you assume that's how they would react, but that doesn't have any legal standing
Oh crap.
Dat Skype
Kerbal.
actually it is, thats why that had to cease and decists the plushie maker
D: I hate Howard Stern now and forever >: /
they have to do something
they are reasonable people shana
or they lose their right to the IP
Pony_9695: well yeah Hasbro probably would do that, but you never know
On what days do they send the newsletter?
Perhaps this could be solved by, you know, talking to Hasbro.
MaxTheBrony: Why?
Chocobunny: Around wednesday or thursday me thinks
a fanbased animation series is common for them to accept
Yes, MaxTheBrony. can we change the topic to that now.
Chrysalis yes, there was a ruling by a Judge latly ( I think it was in the Motorola Microsoft case) where the Judge said "The Amarican Patent Systhem is completly broken"
yeas!
:P
ugh, its to early for this
atleast he survived
This will not end well.
Not at all.
they have such a strong suiing culture its enforced by law
which is just stupid
no
Pony_9695: a company accepting the animation doesn't make it any more legal.
an accident by definition has no blame
but you go there and you can sue just about anyone for it
they have never sued anyone for fanbased animations ok
Pingas mark one.
why start now
Great rocket of pingas is actually edoing well.
Scratch that.
Phase4 why launch an icbm?
Chrysalis: It's a recreated ICBM, named Pingas.
00,02Chrysalis, not the final build :P
Pingas mark 2 under construction, Phase4?
.me Yawns
Hi!
Hi Jim.
Hi Jim :)
there is some hope
we hade just as much hope getting derpy back
but we did it
hasn't hasbro taken down certain self-made pony plush actions?
she would have been delated
Phase4: You need a thingy-special machine. I forgot the name, but it autosteers the rocket after you go into space.
I just tasted cod tounge
yes, more power
it was...interesting
00,02theres a mod for that
to early
Phase4: It's not a mod.
It's in the vanilla game.
Shana: I heard that, but I think that was resolved and it was only a few in order to make sure that they keep the intelectual property or something
the fans are important to hasbro and they would not want to hurt that connection
it can work
00,02Chocobunny, ?
00,02i'd like that
you just got to want it to work
Phase4: Go into advanced shizzle. It was a long time since I played.
DB_Brony: ok thats pretty nice then
and there is one law (I forgot the exact description) that sais: If you don't prodect you trademark from people, than you loose that trademark (or something like that), meaning, when 10 different componys use your Trademark, and you do nothing about it, and an 11th company comes around that also uses this Trademark, than you have no right sueing them if you haven't sued the other ones (but I could be mistaken about the exact wording , I
woah the wall
shana: from what i heard its only the peole trying to make a business out of selling multiples of the same plush
well... my longest comment yet I think :/
Way too early for me
Somewhere around here.
Woah
Is that in the vanilla?
chocobunny: SAS module
Dat wall of legal jargon.
Chocobunny: that's not the vanilla! :D
im tring to inspire some ideas not start a court war
Hi Meanwhile :)
Phase4: S.A.S module
Pony_9695: It's similar to artists taking comissions. Whileillegal Hasbro allows them to do it and doesn't sue them. I'm pretty sure the same thing would happen with a fanmade animation.
this is a simple idea
Allo MadSurge.
00,02Chocobunny, doesnt pilot after you seperate
which can be achieved simply
00,02oh
It does if you put it at the top.
00,02yeah, it helps
hmm
ah good
http://i.imgur.com/yyElB.jpg
so... whos taking law advice from and internet chat room?
you just have to work at it for it to succed
Jim: Pfft.
And I think the key for it was T, Phase4.
Jim: wat..............
are those tiny moving fingys people or chickens?
RoboGerbil: it's called wisdom of the crowd
Is the new Mlp season cooming this August guys?

00,02yep
hi AttacktheAndalite
Might I suggest some booster rockets, this beast needs to be as dangerous as possible
oooh, is Phase4 playing KSP again?
That rocket looks... super safe
MaxTheBrony: I think it's gonna come later
Blow dem kerbal up.
Aw D:
Oh fuck.

Well that went well.

any way sorry for causing such a problem
Oh holy hellfire!

WHOOPS?! You crashed it before it even took off and all you've got to say is whoops?!
Whhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
They ded?
Jebediah is best Kerbal. http://i.imgur.com/LUkl0.gif

Dunno MadSurge :P
Meanwhile? sleeping? Pfft
Meanwhile: Dude, did you sleep at all since I left?
AttacktheAndalite: No.

Holy sheeet.
Spectrum_Rush|Lurkin: Mhmm. I've been juggling this and LoL

Phase4: Press T, then launch.
How are we going guys?
00,02Chocobunny, i did
Great, SpringStingray :$
amazing SpringStingray , you?
Chocobunny: he has SAS on all the time, it just isn't enough
It needs more structual integrity
05Scoot-Scootaloo

Trippy Rocket Powahz

nasa should fund this game, so more people get interested into space exploration.
00,03Yeah, give me a sec
till ya die
that looks awesome :)
Machanical space squid go!
thats a werid rocket design
Bamf.
why is there only one kerbal in it
00,02success
back to the ocean for him MegaMoonShine
shana: nasa actually tried to make a mmo space game a while ago, dunno howthat turned out
It's a new cockpit they added
That thing + smart squids = not good.
00,02alexxm, new version
00,02i wonder
ok then Phase4
The other 2 are on leave for psychiatric puporses :)
twi_sprinkle_GS17: you mean moon base alpha?
So much for operation banana. looks like the fist stage di did the splits
Are you actually trying to gte somewhere, or do you just launch rockets to watch them blow up?
*first
shana: hm, i forgot about that one, but im actually thinking of a different one
Eulshy: He's trying new designs :p
Eulshy: That's what sumica does though phase loves to do it a few times
Fisting.
Yuck.Ã¶
00,02oh awesome
00,02i can do some clever
c'mon common typo
Look out! He's changing .cfg's!
shana: it included exploring earth nasa stations and learning about them and how to run rockets i think, i read a bout it many years ago
OH GOD.
Phase4: oO what editor is this? looks gtk based
00,02shana, geany
Phase4: thanks, looks pretty neat
00,02its my fav editor :)
I am trying to get used to emacs
otherwise vim user :D
Kandarihu: Sounds reasonable
00,02YHES
I see NASA and MMO in one sentence...I can't help but think of Moonbase Alpha...lol
00,02i've made my old designs work
00,02TRI
00,02:3
You hacker you :p
00,02its been too long
Phase4: What did you change in the code?
Kandarihu, maybe if academia was a bit more cutthroat? like the old Unseen Universityi
?
00,02ok
00,02aparently its not that somple
00,02simple'
Kandarihu: implying Moonbase Alpha isn't a already the greatest Space MMO that will ever be released.
Was gonna say, it'll be uynstable
Wat
A rocket launching MMO couldn't be that bad
Dafuq
ded
spunds like a good idea to me
00,02yeah, physics change
Have a player the owner of a SPace Program on their own planet, sending rockets and getting pieces from other civilisations
^
That would be pretty cool
Right
Give this idea to Nasa.
Then again, with the rise of SpaceX and the need for government austerity, I can honestly imagine NASA being turned into a regulatory agency for a fledgling space travel industry. If NASA were to make an MMO on the side under this vision, I can imagine it to be a bit more like EVE Online or something.
Earn money for discoveries, building award winning rockets and having partnerships
So the endgame of a planet in Spore, but better?
And then we will have fun.
OtakuTom: YESH
What did I just see while entering?
Except not space ships, more rockets
Spacestage of spore was fun.
I hate how many people say it is boring.
The giant rocket danced like it was made of noodles
Chocobunny: Second stage and Space Stage were the best
SpringStingray: My favourite stages were cell, creature,civilization and space.
I hate tribal.
what was so bad about the tribal stage
Tribal was one of my least liked
Nothing really happened
Other than the Grox stealing my people.
Hot a what?
00,02so i'm done streaming for tonight
Alrighty, seeya Phase4
Night, Phase4.

Liokin-Bot: Hiya bro /)
killerpony7733: Sup bro /)
It's a shame the internet spoiled the big twist of the first game long before I played it :(
I didn't see much about the first game
I didn't even know there was a twist
I got the demo for the first one once
SpringStingray: there's one, but I'm not telling :)
Alright im trying to keep track

my tootsies are freeeeeeezing
Liokin-Bot: he'll murder you only if you menace the girl/directly attack him, so he's not too dangerous
00,02wow, arkham asylum has incredibly fluid combat
Phase4: it's a good game :)
Phase4: I heard that people were having issues with it, being glitchy
OH COME ON
00,02huh
00,02aparently its using the unreal engine
just remember Phase4 don't button mash let it flow through you, don't rush and you'll be a master at complete combos
MadSurge: Its adorable really. Like if I carried aound sweetie belle while she leeched off of other corpses and I murdered other ponies. It seems psychtic. In a fatherly way :3
00,02did not think it was capable of that but whatever
Phase4: Many games uses it
00,02Spectrum_Rush|Lurkin, i figured that quick :)
Psychotic*
Liokin-Bot: yeah, it's creepy but also cute :D
:) never shoulda doubted ya Phase4
MadSurge: I mean look at her shes just a tot :D
Hey im back everypony! Who's streaming?
Liokin-Bot: even the ones from the first game were cute, if not a little more creepy
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Mmmm freezer blanket
Eulshy: When you're done with it send it here, might be warm once it arrives
MadSurge: -lol omg she even raises her hand like a little foal like she is saying "Up up" thats too cute -lol XD
hands*
Judging by this time One of my guesses for streamers would probably be Phase4 But I cannot see his OC anywhere so chanches are it isnt him.
Hey Derpdash :)
00,02TheRandomkid321, its Wrek
Okay
TheRandomkid321: it's Wrek!
meow
its meow
Hey MegaMoonShine
/me pets Eulshy
/me Purrs
Bioshock 2... I have always wnated a minecraft map of that city.
TheRandomkid321: it's a great game :)
TheRandomkid321: That... would be GENIUS! :O
Hello everyone
Is Bioshock infinite ay good... It seems odd since it is set int he scy and not the sea
DED
Thrackerzod: Sup bro /)
TheRandomkid321: It's not out yet
^
MegaMoonSHine Oh. Well id otn follow Bioshock.
*dont
Liokin-Bot hey (\
TheRandomkid321: I don't either :D
MR BUBBLES, NOOOO :'(
But it seems like a fun enough series
ded
STory seems confusing though.
Oh come on Wrek, melee the fuck out of him|
PIKACHUUU!
Rape him?
ded
XD
WHy do you keep picking up that little... Thing!? Pedo much?
lol
>.>
TheRandomkid321: -lol it be his babeh! >:3
I have $16.13 left in my Steam Wallet, and not sure what to buy.
TheRandomkid321 : its for a mission he has to protect her while she gathers adam
Kandarihu: Buy me stuff
Today I found a secret minecraft 360 skin pack. Well not really secret but it not very known.
GtheRandomkid321 grats
TheRandomkid321: alternatively you can kill her to gather a lot of Adam right away, but in the long run it's a net loss
Are there any whale in game? Like you see from windows? Well by whales I also mean Collosal sea creatures in general.
TheRandomkid321: no, but the Big Daddies sound like whales :D
madSurge That's good then. I get terrified of collosal sea creatures even if they dont look scary... So you could imagine what happened in that HL2 scene where the teleporter is malfunctioning...
TheRandomkid321: still haven't played that one :|
MadSurge it's in the first five minutes
Yeah Wrek, that's the drill! Melee them all! :D
^What a pun
I like this 50's music
50s music makes everything creepier
:D
Now i suddenly want my ;ower half warm, but my top half cold
killerpony7733: *rimshot*
alexxm I think the oppisite
TheRandomkid321: Makes me want to play fallout -lol
that turret really helps
See? Fallout doesn't have the monopoly on '50s music.
WHAT IS THAT GIRL THI NG DOING WITH THE CORPSE!?
taking adam from it
shes eating it!and then shes gonna eat me!
Oh my goooooooooooooooooooood! :O
twi_sprinkle_GS17: -lol nooo shes like a mosquito :3
alexxm Adam? I have never played Bioshock before kay.
Liokin-Bot: i hate mosquitos >: (
this game seems hard
ok then TheRandomkid321 it powers the stuff like lightning attacks
twi_sprinkle_GS17: So you hagte small foals is what your saying?
Mosquito bites you... EAT IT! Take back what is yours!
twi_sprinkle_GS17: So let me ask you this....
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Do you like bananas?
TheRandomkid321: with interest!
seems like a hard game
Liokin-Bot: that may be possible, but to answer your question, ill ask this: do You like mmmbananas?
Seven eyes? Seven Horns? (if ya know what I mean)
O_____0
TheRandomkid321: wow, sounds horny
twi_sprinkle_GS17: no no no so your a beeyatch...that likes mmmmmbananas??? right? *reaxches into bananana bag..
Hard game is hard
/me quick draws a banana bag and presses the buttong before Liokin-Bot
twi_sprinkle_GS17, I'm alright with bananas. I don't love them and I don't hate them. It's cool
Eulshy: it's more like Wrek always forgets to melee people :D
Kandarihu: well thats good, then you wont miss them, ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
/me "Well ill tell you were you can figure out your bananan love" presses button "ON THE MOOON"
What would Celestia say if someone responded "meh"?
come come now little one. Thats enough draining blood :3
MadSurge: depends on her mood. the only thing that can really stop her is lack of banana bags
I am going to waste 70 dollars on this! https://content.ebgames.com.au/website/images/detail/157663_detail_v2.jpg BECASUE IDGAF!
Chat derp? Or has BIRDEMIC come!?
but the parasites say nuuuuuuuuuuu
then everyone died
but the parasotes are like bitches
Eulshy: Bitches that like mmmmmmbananas??
GOD! I am BEHIND! Brb REFRESHIN!
Doesn't matter
By like 5 minutes
Heya everybrony :)
MaxTheBrony: Sup bro /)
hello~
Hello MAX!
Heya MaxTheBrony :)
Liokin-Bot: (\ sup :)
hoi MaxTheBrony
OH SHOOP! I should have ben in bed AN HOUR AGO!
:D
Gtg everyone
see ya XD
Bye TheRandomkid321 :) Cya
i fink i might fall asleep watching the stream
Ah hell.....alarm...
ALAAAAARM-never happened :D
hey i assume it's brony64 streaming, what's he playing?
Sx963: Wrek
Sx963: Nope, wrek. And he's playing Bioshock 2
Sx963: qrek is playing bioshock 2
^What he said
they*
okay okay got it thanks XD
he be trippin
TOO MUCH ALCOHOOOL
That turret
i remember being genuinely bewildered when a friend tried to explain the story behind bioshock.
Fings are dark and i cant see anyfing
Sx963: it's a weird story ainnit
well nightmare fuel always work
^
So quiet
O_______0
JERK WREK :'(
why would you do that
did he kill her...?
EEEEEEEEEVIL!
LESS ADAM FOR YOU
/me considers only good endings canon
?
Eulshy: yes he did
awww
the little girl was kinda cute looking
Eulshy: that gives you immediately more Adam, but if you rescue them they give you extra Adam and powers that in the long run gives you more :)
In the form of wrapped gifts, no less
so, why did he kill her then, the latter option seems better in the long run
well wrek is rather impatient, that or maybe he didnt know that he could ignore the objective
Maybe because it's not immediate, the manual just tells you "you get less adam if you rescue them"
http://derpiboo.ru/53782 Und dann I killed the chat... with D'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaw
X.X
O__O that's one huge horn
Spectrum_Rush|Lurkin: Pffff try harder i got a heart of titanium
i have no heart
*squidwardface*
how many times can you respawn?
Infinite
as many times as you need to
is there a downside?
nope
twi_sprinkle_GS17: You cant die technically.
or if there is i forget it
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Achievements
twi_sprinkle_GS17: not really, but it makes dying less threatening
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Some things have to be killed on first encounter for achievements. But aside from that no.
wow, not often you see a game with godmode legitly
It's not godmode per say, But darn close
^
Dying is still a hassle though
Atleast it doesn't give you a full on all ammo and the stuff again each time,
^
^^
how does the game explain the respawning?
respawn chambers i think
twi_sprinkle_GS17: reviving chambers
interesting
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Little sister take you there.
The glowy tubes that function as checkpoints
uh no the things remake or repair someone who has a matching DNA that it says that is allowed to use it
Liokin-Bot:was that the girl he killed?
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Yup. But theres more than one.
so many siblings
Actually they aren't related any of them
twi_sprinkle_GS17: The bugs are in several of them.
Did he pick hard mode? O__o
Just pheromones that keeps them linked
Liokin-Bot: bugs? those adam things?
hello everypony
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Yeah they just all are infected.
hoi SirGanjalf
hello SirGanjalf :)
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Saw the little leech thing you crushed when you tore it out of ittle sister?
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Thats the bug.
SirGanjalf: Sup bro /)
Liokin-Bot: sounds like a fun world :P
twi_sprinkle_GS17: too much Adam splices your brain and psyche into a mess
LightTrooper105: (\
Bioshock 2?
Yep
SirGanjalf: si seniore
twi_sprinkle_GS17: -lol well it should bring some comfort to you that you have ""Siblings" Who have your back :3
Liokin-Bot: yeah, blood-sucking sibling ._. i wouldnt give her a piggy-back ride..
twi_sprinkle_GS17: She will never hurt you. Because she wubs you :3 and thats no joke -lol your siblings really do care for you.
Liokin-Bot: ..and then you kill em :P
twi_sprinkle_GS17: But you have to hurt her or eventually the adam will corrupt her and she will go nuts.
twi_sprinkle_GS17: she only gets them from dead people, and Big Daddies aren't dead :D
MadSurge: are big daddies guys in suits?
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Yup.
Liokin-Bot: are they human?
They are prisoners arent they?
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Yup.
Forced to be in the suit
Or am i thinking space marines now xD
twi_sprinkle_GS17: The suits bind them to the little sisters.
twi_sprinkle_GS17: conditioned into being unstoppable monsters that protect little sisters
wow
such a weird game
heh
twi_sprinkle_GS17: But YOUR specific little sister you can never kill her you have to protect her. Because your linked. If she dies you will die.
how do you even come up with this stuff
Fantasy ^^
twi_sprinkle_GS17: spiritual successor to System Shock
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Well isnt this basically love in a nutshell? When you love something enough you kill for it >:3
one more question-whats the objective of the game?
plot-wise
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Find your little sister and protect her forever :3
Liokin-Bot: love is evil ._.
twi_sprinkle_GS17: this game? Find your old little sister and bring her out of Rapture
twi_sprinkle_GS17: If you dont find her your suit will shut down and you will die. Theres a life support system in the suit that keeps you alive.
Liokin-Bot: and you cant take it off?
twi_sprinkle_GS17: LIFE SUPPORT
twi_sprinkle_GS17: i dont think so
twi_sprinkle_GS17: If you take it off your body will fail
Yeah
twi_sprinkle_GS17: the protagonist is the first big daddy.
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Heart shut down lungs everything
falling asleep
hm k, thx for explaining teh crazyness :P
^^
This game does have a lack of ponies tho dont you agree?
twi_sprinkle_GS17: See how the other big daddy wont attack you when un provoked? Its cause he is your brother :3
twi_sprinkle_GS17: you should try the first, it explains all about the city
Hey now not everything needs ponies,
D:
MaxTheBrony: Yes it needs ponies.
Ponies 24/7 will really bore you in the end
Liokin-Bot: wat a relationship :P
MadSurge: eh too much bloody murder for me
killerpony7733: True :) but now im in a pony mood so ^^
twi_sprinkle_GS17: I see :(
twi_sprinkle_GS17: -lol hey if it makes you feel any better. If I was a big daddy and you were my little brother. I would not kill you :)
haha
Liokin-Bot: yay ._.
MaxTheBrony: Obviously, I just stick with the show and some pony related stuff to satisfy the need
twi_sprinkle_GS17: -lawl
^^
the other big brothers dont have life chambers?
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Nope
I really like wreks persistence
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Your a special one.
He just keeps on trying
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Yes but some people would seriously rage by now,
yep
oh hi everypony...
Heya Bronysith
Bronysith: Sup bro /)
Hey Bronysith
hi Bronysith :)
Dat one handed reload.
Bronysith: Hey sith
why is he playing the bad bioshock?
bioshock one is far surperior. but i cant say that bioshock 2 is BAD so to speak
Bronysith will u be linking more funny pics today?
oh shit i almost forgot Liokin-Bot (\
05cause the first one refuses to launch on my computer
Bronysith: -lol
Wrek: that sucks...
you play as big daddy delta right?
yep
bioshock infinite...i wonder how that will be
i hope its good
is it bad i think that little sisters are cute?
i mean it seems intresting and i wonder how much those portals to alternate worlds will fit into it
Bronysith: you seemed depressed when you came in you ok?
Liokin-Bot: what? depressed? nononon. if i was depressed you would know
i just woke up thats all
Bronysith: Ok kool.
~ Bronysith used to wonder how Bioshock infinite would be, but then he waited just to find out and see~
my god...bioshock is one of the best games i have ever played
kewl story, good philosophy, great friggin combat
D:
i heard there was a bioshock movie being made
Is there?
um
im not sure what to think on that...
i heard it was coming out 2013
so after the zombies come?
Wrek: pierce the heavens with your drill through that guys chest!

Hello BaconMane!
Bronysith none of my cousins are called alexx and i only have aunts so as far as i'm aware we aren't releated
so what now
Good question
....team deathmatch?
hell in a cell match for the bronystate championship?
05so far: the infinite respawns are silly. the hard difficulty is also silly. its not hard jsut repetitive sicne it was made with the infinite respawn in mind. guns and combat feel good except for soem sounds. aiming redcules are also silly.
yup
that bite-size update
creepy
So what now?
take over the world...
hell in a cell match for the bronystate championship?
Wrek: are you getting the dark souls pc port next month..?

SirGanjalf yeah valve dun goofed with that
its not Wheatley, its the Space Core
/me noms on Chrysalis
hey Chrysalis
hey
08,01yo
Chrysalis: The Portal 2 blog labeled it Wheatley, but as many of you are no doubt itching to point out in the comments section, the "in spaaaaaace" quote actually comes from the Space Core. Observant gamers, however, will note that the core depicted on the panel actually has Wheatley's distinctive circular "pupil" rather than the Space Core's hoop-shaped one.
how've you been Chrysalis
so, yeah, who knows?
alexxm been pretty good, just applyin for jobs already
08,01define good.

Bronysith: OMG YOU TOO?
KA-BEWWWWWWM

such a stream chat is ideal for a live let's play...we should do this one day
when will the next great pony war happen
TheKoreanBrony1354
so what now
the internet has accepted the pony master race. no more wars
:O
I accidentially bronified half my politics board
What game is this and who's streaming?
derpy_pony: ew, politics
derpy_pony, cool
it's fun if you keep the idiots, partisans and narcissists out
is that good derpy_pony
I think it is
that sounds really hard to do, derpy_pony. Today it seems thatm everybody's corrupted.
well congrats on doing that then derpy_pony
hotdiggedydemon
gtg, later :)
What game is this?
Derpdash: fluffly rainbows 2
05Bronysith: behave
05Derpdash: its SPAZ
Oh ok thanks Wrek
and lol Bronysith
ANyone here play ThreadSpace: Hyperbol?
sorry
space pirates and zombies oO
Bronysith: I hinestly prefer Fluffy Rainbows 1 over the sequel.
sounds like firefly :D
*Honestly
the rainbows were fluffier in the first one String_Shredder
/me slaps Bronysith for lying about the game name
I approve of fluffy things
/me dodges twi_sprinkle_GS17 s lame excuse of a slap
/me watches as Bronysith stumbles onto the mine he planted
boom.
/me deactivates the mine before it boomed
/me eats the mine
Bronysith: youll still die for eating a mine, your stomach wont digest metal
i have a lead belly perk
hey Bronysith have you heard...skyrim is better than morrowind
^That is a pure lie,
yup
twi_sprinkle_GS17: your lie is bad and you should feel bad
Bronysith: tis the truth!
Most of the games before skyrim was generally better
most?
Yeah, To about oblivion
oblivion was great
i loved it
Oblivion was good and stuff, Though morrowind and what not beat it by comparison
well yea
morrowind is alot less friendly....
Oblivion is better when compared to skyrim
YES
skyrim is the king of all games in history
I'm kind of eyeing Fallout 3 GoTY edition, but Steam says it's not optimized for Windows 7. How much of a problem is this going to be?
Skyrim was a right step towards many game mechanics but not story wise and partially it's world
its best game in all the omniverses
but teh combat in morrowind could be touched up killerpony7733
Bronysith: Yeah the fact you actually miss a point blank swing?, Thats where oblivion and skyrim do it right
killerpony7733: i wonder if there is a mod for morrowind to touch up the combat though
compeutor derped had to restart it
Most likely is modding community was big for it i believe
i heard there was an ak47 mod
megusta
Oh god the gun mods for some of the TOS games
killerpony7733, you mean TES?
right,
:D
i like morrowind cause you actually have to read where to go
instead of hte almighty arrow to tell you where to go
Yeah a very well done and immersing mechanic
reading on a monitor is bad for your eyes
and no quick travel in morrowind. unless you take a boat or stilt strider
Guys, how "Not Optimized for Windows 7" is Fallout 3?
its not like youre force to use quicktravel
Yep, Though for fallout 3 and FONV it can be understood
killerpony7733: again
i like how in morrowind you can be ambushed while resting
Bronysith: Same goes with fallout 1 and 2 during travel
killerpony7733: i still need to play those
still getting used to the combat system of those games
but right now morrowind, new vegas and dead island have my attention
Bronysith: Seriously meeting a group of mutants or a patrol of ENCLAVE was god damn scary as a low ish level with no powerful weapons
I'mSorry. I'm not supposed to ask more than once. It's harrassment.
hey Bronysith How far into Morrowind are you? First time playthrough?
yes
first time play through
:)
im working on thieves guild questline
then ill do the main quest
Wait you can get a awesome waifu through that quest line Bronysith
hows that going fo r you Bronysith
alexxm: oh it is fun, the stealing in that game is very interesting
Bronysith how's it intresting?
it is not easy
I can only recommend you get morrowind expanded graphic mod and better bodies, better heads mod :)
to update the graphics a bit :)
well i am going to play dead island right now
fucking steam sales
:D have fun
The $20 I put into my Steam is basically the $20 I'd have put it at the beginning of the month. I wanted to do it early to get in on the Steam Sale
whats going on in the stream now?
^
Cypresswolf|Work, Space Pirates & Zombies
was about to ask the same thing...
:) I was close - thinking Space Invaders
Kandarihu: 'not optimized for window7' basically means 'you might have to tweak some settings and do some googling'
Kandarihu: yeah, I don't recognize this game at all...
Yaaay, Bridle Gossip in italian! It was cute :)
doing paperwork today - may or may not have to haunt a jobsite later
Are you in the business of poltergiest? =P
My friend has diarrhea and I just ate his sandwich. Am I going to die/

Bambi: You haven't seen a almost full on mods day
Well, what I have in my cart is SPAZ, Cogs, Beat Hazard Complete and Darwinia+Soundtrack DLC. That's going to leave me with $2.85 in my wallet. Any suggestions?
I saw about 7 mods taling a while ago
BaconMane: this is my first time in #bronystate... What goes on in here? (The stream I mean...)
Kandarihu: which other indie games do you have already?
00,03Ah, welcome to Bronystate! Please read the rules and we hope you enjoy your stay :)
0,5rdash you should check out the "About us" page
0,5And don't forget to read the rules!
Kandarihu I would say Threadspace: Hyperbol, awesome game, but its a MP game that barely anyone plays. I hope to change that. XD
Check rules FAQ and stuff
rdash: This is the chat that generally has no relation to what's streaming, and half the time, nothing is streaming! Have fun here ^^
