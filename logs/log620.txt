" The term probably derives from "MMOG", which can be traced back to the 1995 E3 Convention, when Dale Addink used it to describe Confirmed Kill."
Gamecubes all the way! I still have mine!

DayZ a few years back, yes, today? No.
*I still*
"endgame"
character progression would imply an RPG - wouldn't an MMO just refer to scale and the fact that it's "multiplayer"?
plus its not even a "game" its a mod
1,11Minecraft could technically be an MMO.
ad
I still have a Gamecube laying around here somewhere
Yeah

i liked runescape up until about a year ago, when i finally had the realitization "i'm just grinding now - this isn't fun"
pvp in WoW was fuuuun. minus the ragers
Allright :D

00,02Allegr0, runescape 1 or 2?
My brother does too, but his lego (that is coming out) is based on Eve Online
Theres more Runscapes?
O.o
I use to compete against my brothers on Runescape
1,11PillowPoni: what'd you think about it?
"Classic"
mmos have endings?

Theres a runescape 2?
:p
00,02cachi01|mobile, its just called runescape
Oh
00,02runescape 1 is called 'clasic' now

anyone here have an opinion of GW2 yet?
lol
GW2 for headstart only, right?

1,11For some reason, cheezburger.com freezes my computer.
00,02my computers before about 2006 were assembled from spare parts found on the side of the street
*can
1,11Otherwise you end up wandering from server-to-server and end up looking like a dumbass.
00,02400MHz pentiun 2 FTW!!!
reason i ask is I'm thinking of getting it, though i never played GW1. I figure since there's no sub theres little to lose

it's good
it mixed FPS with Puzzle very well
nah
OH THE BUTHURT
Actually, I'm mixed about this.
but it is NOT No. 1
Um...................:S
On the other hand, no goddamn Metroid Prime anywhere. *throws a fit at SaxyPretender*
i'm ok with this
but not for the top
and it had a very great concept
How is that as good as tetris?
oh wow
this is pitiful
it was good, but it doest deserve first
0,14yeah, Metroid Prime 1 should've been on there
Seriously?
that is not ok
There's already 501 kicks?
And I read this before :D
OKAY OKAY ookay
boy, this list eats more shit than a sentient toilet
Tetris is simple but challenging to master
eh. Tetris, really?
and the characters were great too
00,02Portals are an incredibly simple mechanic, used cleverly, to create incredibly interestin puzles
0,14but I'm kinda disappointed in their picks for fighting games
...Why were there no SSB games there?
Okay then, I'm cool.
0,14UMvC3 should NOT have been there
well, at least now i know gamespot is a shitty place for good opinions on games
I know.
1,11Yes, it was. Sixty-something.
no seperate genre lists?
/me has no ida what's going on
Melee should be like top 20
^
0,14yeah =/

hey*
13if you're arguing for gameplay plus GOOD story, that's a higher standard than just gameplay with story

Gonna stream it?
00,02Shizuka, i dont think we've seen good interactive story yet
13not til it's done
Can't wait~
Female voice not transvestite
he did, in the background
13heavy rain sounded like it went too far to the story side, forgot about gameplay
...pony
Helloooo
13its predecessor fahrenheit too
13(and i played fahrenheit... despite cameos from like half the Code Lyoko VAs, the story was mediocre and the gameplay nonexistent)
lol
As a writer I can tell you write now, good interactive story isn't going to happen for a very long time.
Never though he would do this voice
Very. Long. Time.
omg
I cant say a lot of Fahrenheit (indigo prophecy) cause i`ve never playedbit
:D
did wsomeone say Code Lyoko?
Played it*
shit i use to watch that show voraciously
XD
Is there still the Cello/Bass debate?
MAGIIC
00,02the problem i have with mass effect is that you have to shoot things
Nice voice there pretty boy
XD
pick a voice, son!
00,02that doesnt interest me soo muhc

I WANT TO KNOW

xD
00,02myst made me feel like i was stuck on an island
0,14you know I'd say Assassin's Creed does a nice combo between story and gameplay
Lol
0,14as in, the gameplay IS the story
0,14in a way
13it's there, but not quite to the extent that something like mass effect would present story
13it's more subtle
13which is good :)
Xion :`(
It doesn't have the best story either, but it was a step in the right direction.

I'll take AC over Halo any day, thank you very much.

Luna's a background pony?
Or something to that effect
Derpy
I like the concept of Halo.
I like the potential of the universe.
lol, this doesn't look like studying
I don't think the games are exploiting it enough.
backround means they have a lack of mentions, appearances, and lines
^
0,14perfectly understandable
But then, they don't have to, since MS is making money by the assloads.
Half way through
0,14I mean, the games do the necessary expostion
0,14but the real meat in the story lies in the books
Dude
*character*
heheheee
whoever sent this e-mail
no
thats some deidcation
0,14looks like they're trying to up the story telling for Halo 4
Oh, I also like a lot of the sci-fi aesthetics of the concept.
this has gone beyond sad
:D
this is just disturbing
0,14there's two novel trilogies that are tying directly into Halo 4
13haven't sat through a playthrough of halo 3 yet
In the name of Poniator
