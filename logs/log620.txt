Mic I find is pretty good.
Mic's a nice guys tho
He's funny.

GilDash, 9th of September seems to be Berlin meeting, for first time I'll probably get to see Bronies outside of UK
there is a berlin meeting?
i once thought twilight was best pony,but now i'm only fighting my love for rainbow as well

Ninjazz: Stop getting into trouble! :|
PONY: XD

GilDash, Fire dammut. It feels so damn good.

Are there always advanced locals where ever they invade or something?
SuperBrony64: Ohhh. Okies then :> *gives the filly Twilight a stack of books*

GilDash: Don't help the :|

Im back everypony
this movie is trying the MiB flash eraser
yes, because northern iraq is a good target
Wb Obsidian
Welcome back Obsidian
I dont see how something that massive could keep itself in the gravity of a planet like Earth
you know, full of major cities
Dken2021, it's SUPER EFFECTIVE! I can't tell half of what's going on
PillowPoni why did i read stack of boobs?
ColtMagnum: Magic
GilDash: :| I'm talking about Trixie Threads and Trixie Dicks.
lol Govenator
Dick Trixie.
One: I honestly have no idea what you're on about. :S
listen to your governator
tSparx: The energy needed to keep that thing in the air would scorch the Earth
RUSSIAAAA
ColtMagnum: not if magic
Thus Trixie got her nickname: Great and Powerful
tSparx: Space Magic?
seems legit
cachi01|mobile: Because it said books
ColtMagnum: magic
GilDash: :[ Yes you do.
hobokanonpok
ColtMagnum: and/or advanced physics beyond human understanding
What movie is this?
One: Seriously, I really don't. :D
DerpyMuffins Independance day
ColtMagnum: Magic of Love. Where'd your husband go?
PillowPoni thats what i said. Boobs
GilDash, (just play along, I lost track too a long ago)
No, BOOKS
Movie is Independance day
One: Im a dude. And Im not married to a guy.
GilDash: Touché :O
welcome to hell
I KNOW, BOOBS
this movie seriously is afraid of keeping the location for too long...
cachi01|mobile: Maybe you're reading too fast
PONY: I can't be arsed though. XD
boobs?
Books?
ColtMagnum: Of course. Sorry. :$
cachi01|mobile: Books.
boops?
Anyone have a good time converter
00,10lets try and climb over the fireball
ColtMagnum: the way those spaceships keep themself in the air, without visible energy output in any direction, i'm guessing they have something to nulifi gravity
Bloops?
cachi01|mobile: Twilight loves books
what is 9pm est in Swedish time?
:s
booms?
Pizza?
Blips
The world is saved.
Twilight is not lesbo she doesnt like boobs

because bad writing PONY
Goodnight One
One, see ya later
lol
Bye One
bye One

Night, One
Eli: the energy needed for that would still scorch the Earth. To Defy a LAW of Physics takes Pre-Bigbang understanding technology
MaxTheBrony wait... 9pm est is now right?
cachi01|mobile: I'm pretty sure T-Sparx's sexuality isn't canon
Bye one
Lil_B is it?
deploy jackie chan :D
PONY better question would be why are there vampires in Twilight Sparkle?
Dat Novosibinski
tSparx lol
Canadian_Brony, I was just about to put that
Robert L-l-logia
Lil_B all i know is that Gigabit was going to stream at 9pm
brb
shh, tv is on
Canadian_Brony, how about this; WHY DO VAMPIRES IN TWILIGHT SPARKLE
let us watch tv
must....see.....tvvvvv.....
ColtMagnum: i'm not sure about that. if you told someone 500 years ago that we would have TVs, they would have said it's impossible too
PONY WHY ARE THERE VAMPIRES IN TWILIGHT SPARKLE?
cachi01|mobile: But if I were gonna guess about the creators' thoughts, if they have any, I'd not that Pink, Purple, and blue is the color of a commonly used (some would say "the') bisexual flag
man, these tvs have a bad reception
I'd note*
Dat voice
I'm only waiting for will Smith.
MaxTheBrony ah... than forget what I just told you about the time -.- I though we were talking about right now
:D
how many cigars does he smoke
Eli: If Friendship is Magic, and Magic is sufficiently advanced technology, then does that mean Friendship is sufficiently advanced technology?
Wasn't this song in Pulp Fiction?
Still better lovestory than Twilight
Independance day. Hi, everypony.
Ninjazz: What's so important about Will Smith? :S
Lil_B Ah :d
just because we don't ahave the knowledge yet doesn't mean it's impossible. it's just not possible YET
allo Spectator
GilDash, he's my favorite black guy.
gildash sortof main character
Eli Unless it really is impossible.
hai Spectator
And what cowvarkian said.
How're you all donig?!
cowvarkian: No, I've seen this film before, that's not what I meant. XD
Back
PONY: think of edward in twilight now look at this picture of a real vampire http://tinyurl.com/9pvb7z4 who will win?
NO! Not the BEER!
Rumble!
GilDash: What's possibly *unimportant* about Will Smith?
MICHEAL MOORE
omg
someones going super sayan?
EARTH QUAAAAAAKE
but it isn't tSparx
hi Spectator_Mic. I'm pretty good. Finally got my second monitor to have a seperate desktop background then my main one.
just saiyan
Lol
michael moore will kill us all
tSparx: Will Smith is the person you want to be standing beside during an alien invasion. Mark my words.
tSparx: Look, I was just saying, that's all! :S
someone make thor mad
:P you two
/me marks ColtMagnum 's words
Dovah: that ain't no real vampire, this is real vampire; http://mlpf.im/1ij
WILL SMITH!
Fresh prince
and here's the reason why we came for this movie
so, its a 15 mile long ship... that can cover an entire city?
Haha, GilDash, just like my namesake, when I get angry, you'll frikkin' know, lol
PONY: Nosferatu!
<3 Will Smith
This is a story all about how, my life got turned fliped upside down
four score and seven-HOLY CRAP!!
tSparx: ... Okay? :S
So... what do the aliens have so much against USA? and mostly... USA only?
no, they are everywhere
its the entire world
PONY I think they're just focusing on the USA perspective, they're all over
I dunno PONY , why do the terrorists?
I think they started elsewhere, actually
but...the president of the usa saves the world. personally
Fisheh_Fish: They don't. Just ask London
I shall
and spain
and the rest of the world
PONY: Its hapening all over the world, the movie is just set in the USA because everybody else expect the U.S. to police the world
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-google-search-twilight-vampire.jpg
Fisheh_Fish, I'm pretty sure terrorists were against everyone, until US started provoking them.
PONY: In District 9 the aliens stopped over Johannesburg
DaringDerpy: Well, hey, where did this movie get made? Whose independence day did this movie happen in?
PONY: a real vampire is something that is undead, sucks blood and scares the living hell out of you, not somthing that fills the first 2 requirements and replaces the third with "kills you cuz they look so rediculous"
Kinda scary.
giant ovni!
FUN FACT: this movie was directed by a german
inb4 MichaelBayplosion
Lol
Lil_B: O ja!
ITS A GIANT UFO
so, how high above the cities are these things?
it's only a model
Dat pileup
shhhh
00,10is this the bit whre the hot lizzard chick shows up on a bigscreen on the underside and says we come in peace?
because if they're only 15 miles in diameter....
cowvarkian: r u from bioware?
Fun Fact; stuff always happening in US is because Hollywood is in US
sure ColtMagnum
cowarkian I believe they said these were 15mi wide, so you do that math.
we come in peace! ack ack ack!
>.>
PONY however their city scenes are filmed in canada
inb4 boom
what is this?
What movie is this anyway?

He must like to smoke pot...

ColtMagnum: Should I feel bad for laughing at that?
Sorry
k
Probably not. It's funny most of the time.
I've only hear this guy voice burly or manly women
they need 6 hours for this?
00,10So how did the tv's do that? across so many networks?
*inhales* Oh my god!
lol
Lol
dat lawyer joke
amurica!
Bacon[Hazard]: Pot is nowhere near that hard on your throat. I know an old dude's smoked pot every day for the last 40 years, and he doesn't sound great, but not *that* bad
mitt romney?
Nope
ok
Oh god oh man, oh god oh man, oh god oh man oh god oh man!!!!!
had a wierd forhead
00,10dose that meen some network is showing just some corner of the speech?
couldnt tell
"I am safe in my presidential underground bunker. Good luck up there!"
Canadian_Brony: tbh, if an alien race wanted to invade us, theyd win
Lol DaringDerpy That reminds me of that boondocks episode XD
I wanna know what the internet was thinking during the Alien Attack
tSparx:Thanks for the correction. I'm not really that good on drugs, but I know what a smoker sounds like.
g&p
lol
dat orderly fashion
TPB
Lil_B: commenting how will look the aliens?
the internet would spout stupid forced memes
"Do not panic!"
Great and Powerful
dem fender benders
Bacon[Hazard]: Just trying to set the record straight. Plenty of misinformation about pot and other drugs, both too good and too bad
Oh is this the MichaelBayplosion part?
Bacon[Hazard]: eeyup.
THEY CANCELLED IT!
Dayum! You DO NOT TALK TO THE HAND.
ITS A GIANT FLOATING TURD!
Oh wait they did
good point
Lol
thats a long way
oh but
ColtMagnum:no its just a giant UFO
tSparx: Sorry if I offended.
that's what all alien invaders do
90 billion? the universe is not that old
foreshadowing
sonicandmario85: Nope, it's smog
lol too late
ColtMagnum true. If a super-intellegent race has the ability to travel across billions of light years and they wanted to invade us, they would invade us and easily win.
Bacon[Hazard]: Nah nah! NOt at all!
Give the kid the hand grenades... "This is why we can't have nice things!"
90 billion light years? wouldn't that be the far side of the universe? Litterally
DaringDerpy: true, it's 6000 years <_<
There is no competition.
Alright, hate to leave early, but must get ready. Ausgehe!
Canadian_Brony: Its kinda wierd it hasnt happened already. Seeing our planet has a crapton of water.
Freaky deaky?
SInk that oil
seeya tspar-
Canadian_Brony:1 word gods
Sink it in the gulf.
yay insults
ColtMagnum: yeah, salt water
PONY: we have the year 2012
Dem riots?
/me steals TVs
suddenly, nothing changed
cowvarkian: which is the main ingredient for a Fusion Reactor
ikr
Lol
Fisheh_Fish don't bother, none of them have good picture
Canadian_Brony: i think if they have suck tech, they are pacific, ¿why? because proguess is only with peace and comprension
DaringDerpy: Oh right
Riots? Looks like a normal day in the bronx
ColtMagnum: but fusion is sorta shitty for space travelers
This isn't a riot, its a THursday
Hell yes.
cowvarkian: or Fission. Not sure which one but its the energysource of an artificial sun
fission
lol
ColtMagnum yeah, but our telescopes haven't found any planets that can support life. If we can't see them, they probably aren't coming.
wiki says the edge of the observable universe is 46bln lightyears away
welp, he's dead
really Canadian_Brony
Haha.

Chinese democracy
sonicandmario85 do not exist.

cowvarkian yes rly. And we haven't found any.
Canadian_Brony:yes they do
Canadian_Brony: Thats more because of our technology compared to whats actually out there
Canadian_Brony:universe is full of suprises
no, I know we havent found in, with the planets we have discovered, but how does that mean that none exist?
^
The universe is near endless. There will always be possibilities.
Crazy guy is best guy
sonicandmario85 there is no proof gods exist
Canadian_Brony: dont go there
Destroy us all!

Bacon[Hazard]: You mean you wouldn't an alien?

Fisheh_Fish: I mean, what would you think they would look like?
NASA doesn't care about your spouse
Ninjazz: ... This conversation seems familiar...
do these people not realize theres an alien invasion going on?
13http://i.imgur.com/ObJN1.gif hai i brought you some pizza
I think they totally just added this for fanservice
This is a realistic situation about an alien invasion >.>
Its funny how people think of Aliens...
dat reverse effect
Shizuka: D'aaaaaaaaaw
Shizuka uhhhhhh
Bacon[Hazard]: Best case, Avatar. Worst case, Alien
GilDash, Booty.
she is tottaly joining those idiots
Aliens show up-->Hope they bring back Elvis? wtf
*shudders* Alien...
FOREVER!
Best Case, Mars Attacks
Bacon[Hazard]: thats not really an invasion
Shizuku , is that footage reversed?
she has hair like the 80's
cowvarkian: would ya give a damn of a big plate floating on the sky... DOING NOTHING?
Shizuka: Aww
what?
Shmuck
Ninjazz: You're making it hard for me to stay here. :D
XD
ok, basicly: the universe is 46bln years old, so we can only see the parts of the Universe that are within 46bln light years because the light from the other parts hasn't even reached us yet
oh, yeah
stupid internet
Shizuka: applebloom applebloom applebloom applebloom applebloom
GilDash, I'm terrible sorry.
I would go to some place in the middle of nowhere
Terribly*
Ninjazz: It's okay, Ninny.
Light is a terrible thing.
14.6 billion
MacGuyver
lol
Observable universe
11,02Shizuka: Somehow, I think that's just reversed about what actually happened >>
good thing he has connections... this movie is WAY to convinient
13no really
what I said SB :P
lol dat fly reference
I missed something. What did Shizuka say?
Lil_B, it takes a lot to cut off a land line
internet crash
An internet crash?
Lil_B, usually at least a tree.
We're watching people watch TV?..
sortof
dont know how to communicate? make flashing lamps!
Then what are they watching...
but all these TVs suck
Bacon[Hazard] yes. D-Link disconnected
Well, that's creepy.
happenstance incorporated?
PONY with "Connections" I ment that he is lucky to have the phone number of someone in the white house XD "Human Connections"
Awkward
*wrong quote
What movie is this again?
Lil_B, naturally, do you know how many nigerian princes I know myself?
Independace day
ID4
Oh, SWEET!
Independence day

Pfffft.
Ahh! Fox News! Where!?
Fox News is evil!
stupid Fox News

dem countdown
/me laughs his flank off

Wouldn't it have made more sense forthe aliens to have brought their own satelites?
I'm just glad they haven't attacked Canadians
wtf
Its like Men in Black 3 all over again, without K's defence system
PONY intiging :/ ... I shall believe every word because I can't find a flaw
not the fathership!
Every time someone says 'Fox News', Mermaid Man yells "Evil" repeatedly.
Lil_B, of course, you head it on the internet
Oh you'll be fine >_>
Bacon[Hazard] LoLz dat true man

flutter_spin: mass3's ending was kinda a punch to the nuts though

GilDash, any smart insurance man or a banker, would hide in the vault through that.
What's the poinbt of this scene? :S
PONY: Perhaps... either way, if they're all dead they can't make insurance claims. XD

GilDash: screw that, SHE LOST THE CAR!
Lil_B: So... all we need to do is make sure people die by spaceship cannons?
PONY: Would you rather be buried alive when the whole bulding collapses and seals the vault shut. Slowly dying of thirst or suffocating. Or a quick death in the fiery inferno?
I won't be back for long. My computer had a freakout and I had to reset to factory settings. Reinstalling all my shit will take some time.
Gee, how the heck they survive? :S

BronyInstrumental: Hello!
*shields* well sh*t
ello BronyInstrumental
well, that failed
miserably
dem force shields
So... since the aliens were tactical enough to seek for a city of high population to destroy worth, how come they managed to miss the military bases?
lol singin
They need to do some research in Protoss Shields
Marauder's shields
hello everypony xD forgot my password for a sec there
hi BronyInstrumental

Hallo BronyInstrumental
Michael- indeed, ive devolped a pony crush on AJ as of late.

PONY: better to draw them out and wipe em all at once than to do a headhunt
"its a trap!"
boom!
Wow, nice death shriek >.>
Lil_B: Cue Celestia joke.
PONY: Maybe they went by population density instead of military strength?
He ded.
ded
Rex_Mundi: IDK why AJ is not so popular, she deserves it :(
2 vs 1000 I vote for mankind+
damn shields!
AJ is fine on her own
GilDash, it appears so, but how illogical is it to just come around to destroy? instead of conquer or what ever else.
IS OP
they have hax
as always
PONY: Destroying is conquering! Look it up! XD
GilDash, I mean, I'm pretty sure that laser would have been as effective all the way from space as well
what movie is this?
Applejack is very fine
We have 2 left. Get them out of there.
i think someone might get hurt in this
BronyInstrumental: Independence Day
BronyInstrumental: Independence Day. Now with RIFFTRAX!
wait why dont they just send a virus to the mother ship
Michael: Not the aliens fault humans are behind of the shield tech curve
PONY destroy the current dominant species and rebuild with your own
PONY: There's a lot of atmosphere for it to travel through... personally, I'd just throw some tiberium at it and call it a day.

No seriously. If you have the talent, MUST you use it?
ColtMagnum: Ikemen stands for a man that is handsome and attractive. Onee-san is a way to indicate that the person you're talking to is a woman.
AJIsAwesome: so Aj is a masculine woman to Japan?
flutter_spin: and still are
ColtMagnum: No. They're saying that she's attractive.

Godzilla would fuck up the aliens

AJisawsome- sure is opposite there, ayup. Pinkie Pie seems to be the last popular in Japan. Of coarse they like Twilight and fluttershy alot (those 2 tend to get the most raunchy comments). Rainbo dash is really well liked as well. Rarity seems to be less popular than the others.

See, that one at least makes sense.
complaining? who's complaining?
Wait, who's complaining?
/me hugs Shizuka
Shizuka: I loved the stream
Oh I am happy
ETT MOOVED
This EMN only ran long because Shizuka's internet got stuck in "Dialup-esque upstream" mode.
Sure if i have to go somewhere, ill just do what has to be done, but otherwise i hate it.

twilight_sprinkle, an often quoted line from Machiavelli, and it's often misquoted for the lack of what comes that: "But I must be careful that the world doesn't hate me."
STOP MESSING WITH HER

Not that I really agree with Machiavelli, though.

Dark92Enigma: If it ferments.
ALCHOHOL?! IN A TV SHOW?
alexxm, no more than in real life.
Interstate driving is the Worst for me! x_x
: O
11,01One day, I decided to take the interstate, and I found out that none of the things I was worried about happening were ever going to happen.
AJIsAwesome: True that.
VioletLynnScraton: If it ferments.
Alcohol ftw??
Dat voice
sure
Opal is not amused
40km/h is rather boring but simple. 50 is all right. 60 gets nerve-wracking. 80-100 is oddly comforting.
AJIsAwesome: maybe
cachi01|mobile: Alcohol FTW
This is Rarity's revenge for those claws.
11,01And now interstate driving is nothing to me.
Obsidian whats new
the cat's amusment = -0
Hi MadSurge!

Dem sheep

keeping them prisoners
Well, two things.
:O
:P
Silence lower life forms!
My heart
SWEEEEEETIE BEEEEEELLE
D'awwww
;(
First, it's actually really hard to screw up as long as you're conscious.
Considering the fact that sheep don't know what to do without a master. Thats what shepards are for.
D'aaaaaaaaaaaawwwwww <3
HHHHGGGGNNNNN my heart
D'awww
What Have I Done!?
True story.

Sweetie Bell ;-;

MOTHER OF MERCY! *Dies*
I creyed
11,01True.
AJIsAwesome: but they're speaking, sentient beings....
Why cant i hold all these feels...
;__;
Ponies47 o_o that guy must be strong
Ponies47: at least its getting repaired :)
WOOOOOOOOOOOE IT'S MEEEEEEEEEEEEE!??? :'(
Right when Madsurge got on, he launched a Steam game, and then got off the IRC.
must
Highways are long and straight and you could practically read a book while driving them.
someone get the sofa
11,01Since traffic is so organized on the interstate.
LOL
Hmmm... Does Celestia hear prayers?
That too.
cowvarkian: But they can still act on instincts.
>.>
Ponies47 how dabuq do you break a wall with a kick O_O
Everyone's going to the same way.
Nope.avi

Ohai cachi01|mobile!
PONY: not sure

There's plenty of space.
D:
11,01Merging works better than you think.
AS CELESTIA AS MY WITNESS, I WILL NEVER USE THIS MOMENT......AGAIN

lol
And the second part (for me)
Wait, PONIES?
What do you live? :o
....:P
MadSurge: Eeyup
cachi01|mobile: He kicked my bedroom door so hard it swinged right into the wall thus making the hole in the wall
lol
awkwaaaard
WHAATTT!!
xD
Is the realization that if I DO screw up, at that speed, there's probably not going to be much left of me to care.
CUE CREDITS!

lol
Possession.
So many exits, people constantly cutting 3 lanes over in front of me, brake lights blaring left and right ._.

twilight_sprinkle: like a caveman divorce?
Applejack turned into Stretch Armstrong

11,01I hate those people.
11,01They need to learn to catch the next exit.
cowvarkian: o.o didnt know they did that
Really, though.
damnit Rarity
cachi01|mobile: He's fixing it. Plus he's goign to repaint my bedroom as well. :3
The worst part of driving is parking lots.
11,01Though that's harder on turnpikes.
VioletLynnScraton it feels more like a uhmmm soul calibur lol
Ponies47: Not to butt in, but have you talked to your mother about this?
Dat baaad <3
Dammit AJ. Y U SUCH A GUD SISTER?
swimmy!
twilight_sprinkle: was refrencing harvey birdman
*going
The absolute worst part is actually the slowest part.
BAAHD
its all because applebloom is a terrible sister
Ponies47 why did he kicked your door?
cowvarkian: dunno who that is either :P
reasonable demands
politics
Dat analogy
:p
NO ITS NOT
its a cartoon
best comparison
MadSurge: I was talking about the moment when Sweetie Bell said she wanted AJ to be her sister.
AJIsAwesome: She was there when it happened
11,01I've vote traffic lights, but you need those.
I hope that, on Judgement Day, God has the sense to turn all of the parking lots into the flaming hellholes they are.
PsychoticDoc, how so?
Franek12354: TRUE.
When what happend?
acs?
Kandarihu: ask jappleack
Its the exact opposite for me :D
Sister relations are edible like apple pie
she knows
I know what I need to do. *eff yeah face*

I can never gauge how far is too far.

Dark92Enigma, you're behind. You should refresh somewhere in there
Berry Punch in 2 places at once O_o
I guess mud changes eye color........
My policy is to just freaking stop.
dat eye colour
AJIsAwesome: It does!
Strong pony
indeed it does
Celes_Chere: the eye color helps
Celes_Chere: why, wasn't it obvious the FIRST TIME?
That Applejack is a spy!
Prepare Sonic Drowns music
Pushing hay is really hard
11,01A good policy is to stop unless you can't safely stop or you don't have enough distance.
muddy grapes
Making tacky jelly
Spah sappin mah sista!
it's a darn shame the eye contacts change everything except the ye color
Muddy grapes are best grapes
AJisAwesome- I just dont like her, same with Snips and Snails.
Obvious Eye color
MadSurge: I didn't pay terribly much attention. I'm speaking purely visually.
Hi bronystate.
Hey FillyFlam
XylemTube: saw that right away :D
Rex_Mundi: Ok. No problem.
Plotwise, saw it coming a mile away
OK Berry punch is in the race, and then......in the crowd......CHANGELINGS!??????
Heya FillyFlam
how've things been FillyFlam
Same here, Reikim :D
11,01They're not going to give you a ticket if you go through a yellow light because you have 3 ft of stopping distance when the light changed.
FillyFlam: Hello!

Hiya FillyFlam

Hello Flootahshy
Heya Flootahshy
HI FLOOTA
most mmo advertisements lead to crappy games or are just tricks into "immature play" *cough* googlehammer *cough*

then the fun was doubled
" The term probably derives from "MMOG", which can be traced back to the 1995 E3 Convention, when Dale Addink used it to describe Confirmed Kill."
Gamecubes all the way! I still have mine!
:(
/me Hugs Phase4....its gonna be ok
Phase4: Why would she do that!?!? D:
hey +GigabitHarmonie could you consider Day Z MMO?
whats that?
My gamecube wont read discs anymore :(
00,02Ponies47, clearly i was too old for games
maplestory *shudder*
;_;
"The term MMORPG was coined by Richard Garriott, the creator of Ultima Online, in 1997"
1,11Was it worse than Mapel Story or 4Chan?
everypony?
ok you tell everyone. please,.
Story time
GigabitHarmonie: Allegr0 READ THIS NOW http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9c1qqCV1H1r13a36o1_1280.png

Bronysith: THe result of an uninformed generation
Obsidian: jersey shore
xD
so +Allegr0 could you consider Day Z MMO?
Silverscreen: that will be me too :D
Pretty much
pretty much :|
MINECRAFT FTW! wOOt
ya
Silverscreen: too old for videogames? NEVER!!!
Quick_Thinker: I think not
yes
I have an NES SNES, Gamecube, Playstation(doesn't work:(), Wii, and PS3.
it's only a perstistent is all
thats a toughie in my opinion
massive isnt it?
DayZ a few years back, yes, today? No.
*I still*
"endgame"
character progression would imply an RPG - wouldn't an MMO just refer to scale and the fact that it's "multiplayer"?
plus its not even a "game" its a mod
Is The Secret World any good?
1,11Minecraft could technically be an MMO.
ad
I still have a Gamecube laying around here somewhere
Yeah
me too
i have 2 for some reason
Me too.:D
wierd
Isn't Secret World becoming f2p too?
Allegr0: DayZ can be classified as an Massively Multiplayer Sandbox Survival game
progression in ARMA 2
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
i think it might have been a pregnant gamecube?
:P
1,11Dude, I just noticed Vinyl was moonwalking on your monitor!
AjIsAwesome: nes, snes, n64, gamecube (not working), wii, all the playstations, all the DS and an xbox360 and a ps vita

O.o
NEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDD!

Is this live question mark?
Night Star_Shadow
NIght Star_Shadow
Ponies47 lucky he
progression in ARMA 2 not getting shot by bots that can shot you from like 1000m away
flutter_spin: It most likely will need to. It's not doing well enough to keep its current model, especially since they never advertised ever.
Night Star_Shadow
Flootahshy: It is live
1,11I have all the oldschool games as emulators on my comp.
1,11Tell that to Octavia.
CK|GW2: They had free weekend, and now some trial business. Its not doing well

Hey guys~
wait progression > this?
Hello linsett
:P
Silverscreen: I love ...LOVE emulators so much
stepstep
Shitstep
speedcore
What did I miss?
flutter_spin: They didn't get good ratings, either. Their MetaCritic is somewhat weaker than normal, and their lack of advertisement killed them too
1,11otakon: Me to. Dolphin and Virtual boy are my friends.
There's also MODERN classical music!
Allegr0 We still love Octavia and she plays Classical music
wattafack das it mean
Allegr0, I hear you bro so much
Silverscreen: SNES...love my SNES emulator on my Android Tablet...love so much love.
o used to play "Waterworld" on the virtual boy :3
Did I miss anything good?
Whats on stream?
podcast
1,11I know. I play Donkey Kong all the time. :3
Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie
xD
I used to play the karateka game for atari lol
well Allegr0 i would consider it an MMO but since its not even a Game its just a MOD it kind of loses that title to me
Or was it for nes?
flutter_spin: The problem is, you can't hope to beat WoW by giving people another WoW. TSW is essentially a hybrid of WoW questing and GW2 combat....so if you wanted GW2 you would just get GW2, and if you were playing WoW you'd keep doing that. >_>
I think it was for nes
Silverscreen: WHY are you silver, and why are tyou a screen? :I
Buffer :[
reffuB
BrainHurt!
It's all about perspective
Allegr0, GigabitHarmonie could we have a moment of silence for Neil Armstrong please?
CiderIsForDrinking: Know that feel.

lol
Guile's Theme just happened
maxthebrony Make sense
long story short they need money to get to the con and we are donating to them to get them ther. Its only for gas and the hotels
Well that was odd
Guile theme madness is best madness!
1,11alright, so what MMO's have you tried. Which did you like? Which did you hate?
Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie: i live in texas :3
how mutch money you got/
?
they just started. They aren't lookin' right now
It's hard to remember every MMO I've played. It's been a lot.
for instance the ending to Breakdown was bad but the experenice i havd while playing it was freakin awesome i remember getting the ULTRA ACELLERATOR
There we go. Now I need to print off a picture of the mips logo to put on my dartboard.
I remember a weird medieval mmo
That voice is making me fall asleep
1,11I agree. In fact, most games now continue after the ending sequence so you can keep playing.
00,02i played about an hour of eve online
But i forgot its name
attack of the derps, why are there so many derpy names? D:
00,02got lost in space

If the game is good enough thats when i come back and play it some more. Like games like DOOM that game is so damn fun i've played it 50 times

I hate Eve Online
Also i love Eve Online D:<
00,02Allegr0, runescape 1 or 2?
My brother does too, but his lego (that is coming out) is based on Eve Online
*whisper* there are private WoW servers

1,11PillowPoni: what'd you think about it?
Allegr0 - account name?

alegr0 what was your favorite mmo ending

00,02yeah, i started with runescape 2
But then I quit when it started cutting into my schoolwork
Theres a runescape 2?

00,02cachi01|mobile, its just called runescape
Oh
Cue the Simple Plan!
00,02runescape 1 is called 'clasic' now
i have too much freedom some times
Gw1 was epic!
I stopped Runescape when we finished all the quests (free ones; with my brother)
:D
Allegr0: 10 in middle school?
PillowPoni: When I first started I was like "Cool, I can make a character and all and ALL THESE SEXY PEOPLE" and about a year after I was all "I can't get a job because of school schedule" and my laptop would lag and around last year I was all "Mehh it's boring now"
Bronysith: I was

Phase4 - "That's it. I'm outta here"
Silverscreen: And then I mispinged myself. TLDR; "Woo awesome" to "I can't get a job around here" to "Mehh boring" in the course of two years
Gigabit Harmony played EvE? Awesome
That's ok. I asked my brother about E4, because I heard about E3 during 2003 and I thought it was called E4 for 2004
CiderIsForDrinking: Okie doki loki

/me Wants to get Gmod
i owned it like 3 years ago
1,11I do NOT click cheezburger links!
00,02Quick_Thinker, they probably just give beta access to everyone
That or it's my darn CPU usage going to 100% and 80% >:I
I have Gmod so i also have acces to beta?
ah
anyone here have an opinion of GW2 yet?
lol
Silverscreen: Why? O.O
Zephyr i like it :3
GW2 for headstart only, right?
Even though my pc wont run it lol
thats my opinion
Allegr0 - but could it play Crysis?
1,11For some reason, cheezburger.com freezes my computer.
Silverscreen: is second life a good game? cuz i know they made a ponyville map for it
Silverscreen: im sorry
Silverscreen: Same here
Same here silverscreen
1,11The only modern games I've payed for are Duke Nukem Forever (bought it used), Fallout New Vegas and Skyrim.
Youtube crashes my computer...
Silverscreen: i approve of new vegas
Skyrim. Lego Batman 2. Minecraft (I just got like 3 weeks ago)
1,11Twilight_sprinkle: only if you have a bunch of online friends to meet and RP with on there.
Silverscreen yar har fiddle dee
Silverscreen: EQD freezes mine. Can't wait to get a new 1 so I dcan be up to date with anything pony related

*can
/me only has The Sims 3 and TF2 on her computer. I feel so lonely and envious :'c
hmm, not a fan of RPing..
1,11Otherwise you end up wandering from server-to-server and end up looking like a dumbass.
00,02400MHz pentiun 2 FTW!!!
Silverscreen: so other than talking with people theres nothing to do?
D:
PillowPoni theres more free games arround silly :P
/me Doesn't have Sims 3 but has Sims 2 and TONS of add-on packs for Sims 2
I played Guild Wars Beta. That was it.

There are a lot of half ass MMO's out there
This is the most entertaining thing I have ever seen
BRB
Hiya Dken2021!

Banana bag :3

0,14So, I've got a question
They live on forevah!
nope
yes
funfact: the most successful password can be a @ and a certain number of !s
can't be cracked for years
0,14What sort of games would you like for an MMO adaptation?
Dat Gw2 Spirit :3
Back
You should explore the world
Imagine that: playing a game to enjoy yourself. :o
yay
It's almost like that's how games are supposed to work.
:D
CK|GW2 how silly
XD
but if theres no level cap, you cant compete with oh\ther players evenly
Allegr0 What do you think about MMO's going F2P?*
:P
alegr0 whats better maple story or guild wars
okay here is one that will be based entirelly on preference Allegr0 what is your favorite N64 Game you have ever played (mine is Banjo Kazzoie)
00,02Allegr0, would you clasify something like tf2 as an mmo?
1,11<MaxTheBrony> What do you think about MMO's going F2P?*
TheKoreanBrony1354: why would you ask that?
sacred seasons mmo best flash mmo ever it does have a level cap but its 1499 so it's ok and the is one dungeon that you will never beat but will continue to try
:P
O.o
lo
that's what he thinks
good one
Good answer
Lord of the Rings Online did it right
It does.
1,11Team Fortress 2
now i shall play MINECRAFT (pushes button)
For most companies it's a death knell because they don't know how to handle it appropriately.
I eat certain foods at weird times. For example. Sometimes I'll eat left over pizza for breakfest and then have a bowl of cereal 9:00 PM (Like I am now) :p
you'll need some of those special items/weapons for MvM
I like fun :D
:)
Ponies47: I thought I was the only one.:D
AJIsAwesome: NOPE :D

i like Rainbowcrashs88 Twilights theme more
who's guching over the rainbow bitch now?
The problem with a Gundam MMO would be the same problem as these Star Wars MMOs. Everyone in the Star Wars MMOs wants to be a Sith Lord or a Jedi. If there were a Gundam MMO, everyone would want to be a Newtype

The begining of the rainbow dash theme reminds me of Soul Eater theme
I'd play a Zelda MMO.

Bonus points if it has Midna in it.
1,11Pokemon MMO would be best MMO. :P
too bad Nintendo doesn't care about most of their IPs, like Metroid ;_;

The thing is, the point of the fairies in TOoT is that all of the Kokiri children had a companion fairy. Link was the one exception because he was a Hylian living under a mistaken ethnicity.
Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie: did you like the 3D pokemon games like XD and Colosseum?
Damn you laptops, y u die on me. Better question, why do computers hate me?

Buytoast most of the items are just for show.

yo wa shock!
What AJIsAwesome said ^
I Wanted that so badly AJI
The GW2 devs are apparently working on a system whereby you can visit other servers so you can play with friends, IIRC, I think they called it "ghosting" or sommat.
but your camera will be way up in the sky. You see everything. :P
1,11AJIsAwesome: That's why I like playing as Pokemon in Super Smash Brothers.
rawr
00,02fun fact: they had to actually reverse-engineer the game mechanics for pokemon when they wanted to make pokemon stadium, tunrs out no one through to write it down
SNORLAX RAAAAIIIIIIIIN

WHY IS MY TNT OLYMPICS JAVLIEN THROW DISSPERANING?????????????????????????o_o

Buytoast: Uh, what? What items are pay to win? >_>
Phase4: :'(
If my computer keeps getting a massive CPU i'm going to lose my mind and go Incredible Hulk on it.
1,11I think the firs tthing they need to do is make the Pokemon games for the Wii. full 3d, being able to throw a pokeball with the wiimote and stuff...it'd be cool.
Aw Allegr0 you are playing On Usa servers :S?
00,02CiderIsForDrinking, need help with that?

Wake up as a Japanese citizen and now you can play all the mmos that are only i japan

Dead Space
OOH!
YES.
GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0: Have you ever played the original Spyro trilogy and what do you think about the Spyro games after Insomniac?
I do.
They're gonna go bankrupt.
1,11My favorite genre shifts depending on my mood. Same with my game. As for Consoles, I don't have a favorite console. The console doesn't matter, because I focus on the games.
What mod would u like on minecraft??
i had x-wing vs tie-fighter..i gave it away and never played it
Has anyone ever played an MMO named ACE Online? (Better known as Space Cowboy Online or Air Rivals)?
Did you ever played RTS games?
I'll wait for them to answe it.
SuperBrony64 :3
Future FPS Dubstep Zombie games
No NSFW? awe, that means no Princess Molestia =\
1,11Steam is, in my opinion, the GREATEST thing to happen for gamers.
...it's ok.
^
no
I like First person shooters
Agreed
i have to give my fav genre to games like Breakdown (hard to classify ones)
TF2 ftw
Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie: What is your opinion on Electroswing?
Origin is the better choice
TF2!!!
TF2 is awesome
That it is Silverscreen.
Steam is shit
whoa. Dash?
Buytoast O.o Why origin?
Buytoast: Ah, you're just trolling. Kay got it. :D
Why is Luna the gamer pony?
Best thing for PC gamers and FPS Warlords.
lets narrow down the question then - What's your favorite freeware game?
Question: you guys have Diablo II (or any kind of Diabloe game)?
Time to shoot my fireworks in mc :3
1,11What's the first game you've ever played?
1,11SUPER MARIO 64~!
HALF LIFE 2 :D
Xbox 360 or PS3?
Allegr0:reason why i said gigabits streaming is because i reconized dat voice XD
Allegr0 have you listen to the video i gave you for the song Ultra Acellerator yet
What is your favourite game music?
1,11er, my first game...was a Pico.
ouch. My first had to be Zelda.
Well, i wasn't being a smart ass about GW2 being P2W when you can use your real money to purchase in game currency
:)
but about origin yes
My first game was Mario Party 2
first game MARIO 64
Could be Super Mario Bros. or Bugs Bunny game.
Super Mario Bros. NES edition.
MaxTheBrony: He's just trolling. :P
Did you like Golden Sun?
my fav game is super mario galaxy
see?
Either that or Duck Hunt.
differing opinions
CK|GW2: yeah i understand that naow :9
Well, I'm playing PSO2 and it's pretty friggin' sweet. It could use some work on some departments. But I think you're gonna love it.
dang dirty troll
because gravity
:)
GigabitHarmonie: Age of Empires
any other pony think twi is riding RD?
Buytoast: Good thing you can buy it with gold too, then, eh?
...is it safe?
0,14needs more fighting games

Give me an X if you played Golden Sun, guys!
Fighting is Magic :P
O
PC
LOLS
Favorite Game is Tetris ofc
Not this again...
C&C and Red Alert cheesy cut scene alert
okay for serious
>:)
my fav console is N64
i was spot on, this IS the Saturday Super Sassy Sirclejerk (Now with extra ass kissing)
Best game is: Overhyped Sellout Lens Flare Dubstep War Zombies 4 HD
what? Dreamcast? really?
:D DREAMCAST.
Buytoast: If you're not trolling then you're stupid, because you're actually lying about the way a game works just to degrade it. So I'm presuming the better of the two, really. :p
TI-83 for best console!
best game is super metroid
TheWalrusCancer, I remember streaming that
13i sense a canary canary~<3
PS2 took over sadly
They say Tetris is a girl's game.
Gamecube <3
:)
Shiz!
GigabitHarmonie, it was way too expensive in compare to PS2
oh man, you're a riot
gameboy all the way
MOTHAFUCKIN PROJECT JUSTICE
Rumor has it that EA refusing to publish games on the Dreamcast killed it.
PC or consoles?
now you're not even trying to prove me wrong
N64 or OUYA
lol
MASF123: alice cooper was obessed with that game
you're just calling me stupid
I see a Shizu Shizu
Do you think that Black Ops 2 will be the best CoD game yet? Or is it just going to be another shitfest?
N64
1,11I don't have a favorite console. The console doesn't f**king matter. The games are what matter. Especially in this day and age where almost all the platforms have the same graphics and control layout.
naw...
1,11PC's count.
Yes, yes you can!
I rented a Sega Dreamcast, but we got a buggy Sonic Adventure. I glitched into so many things.:D
PC
MASF123: fuck them, Tetris is an asexual game
And this is before (or perhaps part of the reason why) EA became so corrupt.
how does the shit taste there CK?
I wish I could play my dreamcast, but I don't have a/v cables
Lol.
because you're eating it up
LOL
1,11I loved the Dreamcast.
:)
:S
1,11Your voice is annoying. :P
I like the Direction Black Ops 2 is going
Buytoast: Ergo the argument is over, and you are either trolling or dumb. :p
I preordered
yes you are
okay to answer the COd BO2 i think they are trying thier damndest to save the series
So only plants play Tetris?
start whining
everyone loves tetris, even your mom
"What do you think of Steam?" It burns.
Allegr0: We love you.
Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie Did either of you get Dark Souls for PC or console for that matter?
Allegr0 is still considered lazy :P

Are you guys aware about Dust An Elysian Tail? sorry everypony I'm just obsess with this game

1,11I hate everyone.
Origin is full of spyware, do no instal

MASF123:spyro is a game...
Spyro was fun..
MASF123: Sweet Celestia! We need research!
GigabitHarmonie Favorite anime?
Crash and Spyro were great, but the crossover game was so much SUCK
Crash Bandicoot was fun :)
lol
Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie: What do you think about the Spyro remake Skylanders?
i played spyro over at one of my neighbors house it seemed fun and inventive
Silverscreen: I agree :)
Sequel S...ha
I played all 3 for the PS1. All my loves
SPYRO LOOKS KIND OF LIKE SPIKE
DerpyMuffins: gaming questions only

1,11With the Wii still playing GC games AND the GC still being sold, it's not retro.
Quick_Thinker:your not old...
To know what retro is you must define what retro is
and i've played the N64 and SNES
When did the NES come out?
then apply that idea to games
What's going on, Regs?
Quick_Thinker:unless you mean with games XD
AJIsAwesome a long time ago

Silverscreen: I played the HECK out of SMB Deluxe.
/me takes a deep breath
Sega Genesis, SNES, GBC, N64, GBA, Gamecube, NDS, Playstation2, Wii, PS3, PSP, 3DS
Wind Waker has a special place as my first Zelda but then there's TP which is another fave and then Skyward Sword was great and I played LttP and it was great and I played both N64 Zeldas and loved them and GOD DAMN YOU DON'T ASK ME TO CHOOSE A FAVOURITE
GAME GRUMPS ARE AWEOSME
GOOF TROOP!
If the two were put together, I'd be a happy kitten.
1,11I never played anything in the Zelda franchise outside of Twilight Princess.

Ponies47: To each their own I guess
hi GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0
suddenly Guile's Themes
Reikim: I never found it scary or creepy.
Silverscreen: for shame, but that is a good game
Have they come out with Bioshock Infinite yet?

How is that as good as tetris?
PORTAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Great game, but i wouldn't call it number 1...
this is pitiful
it was good, but it doest deserve first
Portal makes perfect sense. It was short, sweet, and well done. It was fun. I did not stop playing that gmae at all when I started play it.
Super Mario Bros. SHOULD BE NO. 1!
00,02Portal is what puzle games should be, its the template for fun
im sorry, portal cannot be 1
0,14yeah, Metroid Prime 1 should've been on there
LOGAN: CALM.DOWN.
Seriously?
that is not ok
SaxyPretender: Oh DEFINITELY.
SaxyPretender I know!
There's already 501 kicks?
And number zero?
And I read this before :D
CAKE
Mishia, most of the rage came from the VERY FIRST reveal about the cel shading.
OKAY OKAY ookay
this game was a test in the first place
boy, this list eats more shit than a sentient toilet
All the anger!
Also, why wasn't any of the Smash Bros games on there?
AHHHHHHHHH PORTAL!!!!!!!
Kandarihu: I know, but it was the best game ever <3
1,11There's a sh*tload of games out there that deserve #1 for their revolutionary, above-the-expectations what they brought about like Portal did.
Tetris is simple but challenging to master
Buytoast: LOGIC!
eh. Tetris, really?
and the characters were great too
00,02Portals are an incredibly simple mechanic, used cleverly, to create incredibly interestin puzles
0,14but I'm kinda disappointed in their picks for fighting games
and it develop your brain acitivity
No fallout 3?
...Why were there no SSB games there?
1,11Reikim: Smash Bros. Melee was on there.
Dr. Mario over Tetris
00,02DashWithRainbows, but the story isnt the point in portal
Okay then, I'm cool.
Silverscreen - it was?
Silverscreen: which number?
Spell-of-Gaming: guess
0,14UMvC3 should NOT have been there
well, at least now i know gamespot is a shitty place for good opinions on games
I know.
1,11Yes, it was. Sixty-something.
Mishia, it turned out to be that great. But please understand that we had no idea at the time.
no seperate genre lists?
/me has no ida what's going on
that game had its glitches, but tons of comdey, waring factions, people , and interactionS <3
SaxyPretender That's because fighting games are underrated.
Melee should be like top 20
^
better than COD :/
0,14yeah =/
1,11...
Allegr0 or GigabitHarmonie Can you name the Spiritual predecessor to Portal?
I disagree Phase. The Story was plenty important. It was simply neither more nor less important than the mechanics. It got a perfect synergy with the mechanics...and that is what games should aim for.
PORTAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
DashWithRainbows, huh, don't remember you being a voiced
Kandarihu: i dont blame you guys. since i was a little girl, i dint give a flyin' buck about graphics
portal 1 wasnt That original, it was based on other games iirc
I'm okay really
I NEUTRAL!!!!
and hai DashWithRainbows
00,02portal was just a "huh, lets make a game where you can do this" with a little bit of polish
PORTAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
HANDS DOWN
Gamesradar is a shitty site
LOGAN: Calm down:|
it wasn't a sellout
1,11Yeah, Portal is still a big no.
Barbetos: It's on the tip of my tongue...
DON'T GOOGLE IT!!
Then again, you cant Hate portal :D
So far goo
d
IMSORRY!!!!!!!!! BUT ITS PORTAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Silverscreen: fun? yes. 1st best game? no.
00,02i know it
Buytoast: I got a free hat from the site. Otherwise, I rarely visit it.
00,02narbacular drop :P
Barbetos: Just rememberd it
Nice phase4
00,02with Princess no knee's
LOGAN: You're going to get kicked.
00,02because she couldnt jump[
ban LOGAN
00,02Allegr0, nope, 3d
he's stupid
OKAY OKAY okay im okay
I liked Portal though for #1 imo i'd say KH...wut? It was something totally new to me when i was a kid :$
I gotta get some sleep, night guys
Buytoast: no please!
LOGAN: and i said HEYEYEYEYEYEAHHH HEYEYEYEAH i said hey! whats going on?
HoodyNinja: Night!
lol
But then, it's hard to choose a "best" or "most influential" game. It's better to sit back and see things as a timeline that flows and splits and creates wonders as well as horrors.
take care HoodyNinja
/me Chucks his gameboy advance at a wall "Mother bucking piece of squee!" :[
Dken2021 oh, hey there.
Were one of the KH games in there?
Portal is okay, but it's definately not the best game of all time
i mean
holy shit
bye HoodyNinja
Ponies47: Oh hey ponies <3
these people
Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie check out Dig n' Rig from Digipen
Reikim: yeah
LOGAN: protip: it irritates the staff when you constantly talk in ALL CAPS
It was another great game
Ohai Mishia
HALLO GigabitHarmonie
00,02Buytoast, i disagree, its at least one of the best
1,11I think I asked for my email to be last...
<--- most amazing banner ever
I LOVE YOU
yeah you watch that chat
Two n mic= rifftrax cmmentary please?
Ponies47: Told ya that game sucked
you mean the SMITE key give away?
Ponies47: why you throw ur gameboy? :<
00,02Buytoast, its what you get when you make a game right
When the GCN first came out, Nintendo made a tech demo video of a realistic Zelda game that looked awesome (although it was nothing but video). We were all looking forward to that when Wind Waker was announced.
me agree with Phase4
1,11What WAS the question?
GigabitHarmonie: You know what they say. A watched chat never stops.
Bitchin
WalkerPony89: Nah. The Gameboy Advance's are old
Whos is talking on the stream
can I send an email still?
?
eh, i ain't saying it's not good
but to say it;s the best
is very very conceited
Phase4: why you have + in front of your name instead os @
oh great, i sense a derpy spam >.>
And now I'm done. Night now; gotta do some work, or something.
no darkfics? jk. best scary/dark fics have no true gore/rape

anyone remember Boktai? man that was awesome
just supsense
Oh wait never mind I need to hear the question dammit
in other words, anyone who didn't speak that much
what?
Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeense
GigabitHarmonie: does Derpy have a "concrete" voice then?
Phase4: it lacks a proper story though. you can argue it doesnt need it, but other games can have both innovative gameplay and good story

Ello mates. What's happening?
00,02LOGAN, @ meens op, can do things like kick and ban people , as well as change cannel modes and the like

1,11My favorite background pony would have to be either Lyra or Vinyl Scratch. I like the wide-spread and fun fan-fiction personalities that these two have, with most of them making sense to their character or design.

Allegr0: what's teh e-mail, i got some names for you two alright.
Fuck this shit i'm not talking anymore
Phase4: like i said, there are games with both innovative fun gameplay, And a good story, that makes them better than a game with just a good gameplay
\
Pinkies4thWall: What's wrong?
#derpyhooves
00,02twilight_sprinkle, but thats what portal has, the 'story' is humerous voice overs, they value ad without getting in the way

oh boy

P &Qs?
My mate is calling me. He wants to play some more minecraft. He isn't a brony :|
Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie: SillyFilly Saturday
Phase4: thats not a story, thats just jokes during gameplay..
What are we emailing to who?
LOGAN ya, but whne it comes
Pinkies4thWall: Same here man. Just keep commenting and don't take it personally
LOGAN: Uh, yeah. That's one of the points of this place
hey
jeez
Pinkies4thWall: I do. It's just that I'm busy replying to other requests sometimes.
Who is talking on the stream?
Saturday Super Sucky Rooty Tooty Equine Shooty Sirclejerk
/me hugs Pinkies4thWall
Phase4: Yes, it does. But that doesn't mean it isn't important. It's synthesized with the gameplay in a way that more games should try to achieve. Let's be honest, Portal would not have sold as well without the story.
disgunbegud.gif
00,02twilight_sprinkle, its not explicitly a story sure, but when you combine it with environmental details it tells the story of what happened to apeture
wut
In a world where gangs rule
Pinkies4thWall: GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0
It needs work
sounds like Snake...Crab Battle lol
dat don lafontaine
i sound like the awnsering machine
wb
Phase4: they built a robot, it turned evil. not much of a story
00,02its not complete, its not suposed to be, its additional to the point of the game, wich is puzzles solved with portals
/me hugs AJIsAwesome
:3
Oh lordy, TS is making a stupid and blatantly opinionated argument.
0,14TS?
Also obtuse. Should've used obtuse.
Ponies47: oh ok :P
AJIsAwesome: /)
twilight_sprinkle.
0,14oh
0,14...oh
Pinkies4thWall: (\
SuperBrony64|AFK:
Yeah
1,11Typo. XD
00,02Reikim, it probably would have sold the same initialy, being part of the orange box, but it is one of the things is really love about the game
Ponies47: what game were you playing?
Phase4: like i said, a game with good gameplay+good story>game with just good gameplay
Phase4: /).
00,02Reikim, (\
He's kind of known for this.
00,02twilight_sprinkle, thats all well and good but theres no room in portal for more story than there is
im back
There's this...strange arrogance behind it.
Phase4: not the way its made
niiiiiice
not spike!
spike lol
Ponies47: oh, never knew there was a ed edd n' eddy game for GBA
*record scratch*
00,02twilight_sprinkle, and if it was made any other way it'd be a different game, with less emphasis on puzles
And I just don't like the way he argues in general. It's...pompous? Also obtuse. Unwilling to accept counterarguments.
GAWRRRSH, Twilight!:D
hi
Gwarsh Twilight
13it's called being a jerk
He'll blatently ignore points in favour of his own.
13and he's on thin ice
Phase4: less emphasis on one thing doesnt make it worse, the game just offers more
-_-
Allegr0 I have to admit I thought it was pinkie
13what are we arguing about now
this is too true i had a child hood friend who i left at least 10 years ago and after 5 years he showed back up in my life
Well there's being a jerk and then there's being an arrogant ponce.
dat rarity :D
Shizuka - Rarity's 3-pack a day raspy voice
o_o
Needs japanese mouth dubbing too
:D
Shizuka: if im a boy or not
.
great pinkie pie
00,02Shizuka, twilight_sprinkle is saying that gameplay + story is better than just gameplay, i'm arguing that portal in particular wouldnt work with more story
Portal´s story works because of the fact that so much of it is extrapolated from the environment anyways...
Where's Rarity
Shizuka: Silverscreen's vision of the FiM finale
actually, what im saying is that Portal 1 isnt the best game of all time..
DAT GOOFY VOICE:D
OH BOY
gooby
what are they doing?
13if gameplay is strong on its own, it doesn't need story
Allegr0 - you MUST use that voice now if you do a fanfic reading that involves Spike from now on
13see minecraft
ldycabary plz
i just waa WHATS GOING ON :[
13see also doom
Shizuka: it's LEGO
Shizuka: YESH
00,02twilight_sprinkle, well i diagree but thats always going to be personal opinion
more Doom
Shizuka: it doesnt Need it, but a game with both is better
LEGO
I get bored of Minecraft
he everypony whats streaming?
0,14same goes for BuyToast
13not really
oh God what am I listening to?
0,14=_=
See also yume nikki lol
13see doom 3
I have no feels sorry
hey*
00,02Shizuka, adding a story to minecraft would ruin it
then again I get bored on any sandbox game
Shizuka: i never played a doom
13if you're arguing for gameplay plus GOOD story, that's a higher standard than just gameplay with story
00,02it'd distract from the sandbox
Phase4 well that ending was really awesome
I disagree, Phase4. Adding an OFFICIAL story would ruin it. Now, creating your own story...that's what it's really for.
otakon: They're reading something Silver wrote
then BURP
lool BEEERP
00,02Reikim, ^
Silverscreen: you wrote a fanfic?
ok
GAWRSH
GOSH JOLLY GEE
1,11I guess you could call it a fanfic.
what was that from?
that was some A movie material there
It is a fanfic.
Shizuka: Does Bioshock count?
GEE WIZ GUY
No ifs ands or buts, it was a fanfic.
Question: Can we hear from your fiancee?
GOLLY WOLLY
What if minecraft becomes like Little Big Planet?
bwowoy woy
Shizuka: well thats what i was saying, clearly a bad story wont make it better. i meant good gameplay+good story>just good gameplay
xD

Shizuka: Don't listen to him, he was really arguing that Portal doesn't have a story. That was the stupid part.
I MUST GO NORTH TO GET THE BIRDS
13depends on how the story is presented
Buytoast like usual
yup
13too much and you're just making a movie
13see mass effect
0,14like MGS4
spike's voice?
XD
:D
lolwut :D
Enji?
Shizuka, Myst is a story game?
I am
Shizuka: like i said, GOOD story plus GOOD gameplay
13rendering a preview of my video
g2g
DAT FEMALE VOICE
Ooh
bye ShadowDash
13but mass effect had good both
Gonna stream it?
00,02Shizuka, i dont think we've seen good interactive story yet
13not til it's done
00,02mass effect gets close
i VOTE cOLGATE
Ah well
Can't wait~
caps
Phase4 heavy rain counts??
Female voice not transvestite
Shizuka: i havent played mass effect
he did, in the background
00,02cachi01|mobile, i've not played it so cant really comment
13heavy rain sounded like it went too far to the story side, forgot about gameplay
...pony
Helloooo
13its predecessor fahrenheit too
Gravity Falls is a pretty good show.
00,02^ Shizuka, thatws what i've heard
Phase4 well its pretty gold
Shizuka is quite female you know
Shizuka: it was a good story though
13(and i played fahrenheit... despite cameos from like half the Code Lyoko VAs, the story was mediocre and the gameplay nonexistent)
yes yes she is CrimsonPhoenix
lol
As a writer I can tell you write now, good interactive story isn't going to happen for a very long time.
Octavia yeah!
Shizuka: I liked it
Never though he would do this voice
Shizuka: if youre saying that mass effect had too much movieness to it, then thats not good enough gameplay then
Very. Long. Time.
I love Code Lyoko.
cachi01|mobile: Heavy Rain tended to get lost in story, also the use of sixaxis tends to devorce the player from the action, instead of inhance it
omg
I cant say a lot of Fahrenheit (indigo prophecy) cause i`ve never playedbit
:D
did wsomeone say Code Lyoko?
you just need hooves giga
Played it*
shit i use to watch that show voraciously
XD
Is there still the Cello/Bass debate?
13but it's a balance, if you're going to have super fantastic story, you're going to sacrifice gameplay
MAGIIC
00,02the problem i have with mass effect is that you have to shoot things
Shizuka: true
Shizuka, how about Myst?
Nice voice there pretty boy
XD
13but if you have super fantastic gameplay, you make your own story
pick a voice, son!
00,02that doesnt interest me soo muhc
AJIsAwesome: Yes
Phase4: well the first one made due with more mechanics based then sklled
Shizuka: but Red Dead Redemption
what is the tale that is being told?
Night All :P
13myst's story is largely locked up in in-game text and the physical books
BASS
BASE
The thing is that it is nearly impossible to break new ground in gameplay, while at the same time provide a complete and moving story
NOT BASS
Major: Night!
1,11http://pastebin.com/3Vv6Edaz
BASE! SAY BASE
13but its' gameplay makes up for it
00,02myst did its story excelently
1,11If you're interesting in reading my story.
00,02the ingame portion anyway
0,14mmm, bass
KINGDOM HEARTS
IT HAS BOTH GREAT STORY
AND GAMEPLAY
too many resources in a game with ground breaking gameplay go to making the gameplay element work (or as so often happens, not work)
Oyus
cachi01|mobile: did we play the same Kingdom Hearts 1?
cachi01|mobile imo, story is all over the place
13the story in game was the canonicity of you exploring the world, things were hinted to you but the vast majority of the actual details are in journals (reading, not gaming) or in the books
SHOW US
what.is.this.story
My body is ready?
13not bad, but it's not quite gameplay married to story
<3
Allegr0 - you MUST put it on the strea... aww
Unnr yes lol i love KH
do it
#rainbowdash
:o
well tell us what it is
did someone draw scat inflation porn again?
GigabitHarmonie: :D Soory for some spelling
show it
cachi01|mobile: Well gameplay's not as good in CoM, Days, or Coded
Allegr0 pm me it then
There are many gameplay problems with is, particularly the camera
I WANT TO KNOW
lol
00,02Shizuka, i'd kinda disagree there, someone in the situation as the guy on myst would work that way
00,02Shizuka, reading books to find out what happend, experimenting with knobs and levers, so on
xD
00,02myst made me feel like i was stuck on an island
JESmith71 days made me cry like a little girl
0,14you know I'd say Assassin's Creed does a nice combo between story and gameplay
Lol
0,14as in, the gameplay IS the story
0,14in a way
^^ Shiz. I checked out your channel and everything. Didn't know you liked Myst
13revelation does it a little better with the memory amulet having the characters narrate journals to you, which lent the emotion into what writing fonts alone don't deliver
Screw that Colgate is best Backround pony
13it's there, but not quite to the extent that something like mass effect would present story
AC isn't perfect but I respect it.
13which is good :)
Xion :`(
It doesn't have the best story either, but it was a step in the right direction.
PINKIE
I'll take AC over Halo any day, thank you very much.
Honestly, the bg pony I'd like to see more of the most is Octavia :3
0,14I like both >.>
Luna's a background pony?
Or something to that effect
Derpy
Love me some Derpy
I like the concept of Halo.
I like the potential of the universe.
lol, this doesn't look like studying
I don't think the games are exploiting it enough.
backround means they have a lack of mentions, appearances, and lines
^
Question: Can I still send in my answer to you guys and read it?
0,14perfectly understandable
But then, they don't have to, since MS is making money by the assloads.
Half way through
Molestia is best celestia
holy fuck did this guy send in a report on why he loves a cartoon horse holy shit
Oh god
Shizuka, the reading to find out what happened i personally like
0,14I mean, the games do the necessary expostion
To be honest, the background charcter I would like to see the most is all of them. I don't play favorites when it comes to stuff like this.
0,14but the real meat in the story lies in the books
My god
Buytoast: Who?
Dude
*character*
heheheee
do you know about spyro eclipse?
whoever sent this e-mail
no
holy shit
thats some deidcation
0,14looks like they're trying to up the story telling for Halo 4
Buytoast: Oh :P
1,11Ponies IS your homework.
Oh, I also like a lot of the sci-fi aesthetics of the concept.
this has gone beyond sad
:D
this is just disturbing
13halo 1 did next to nothing with the universe... what i remember of halo 2 fleshed out the covenant some more but not a whole lot
0,14there's two novel trilogies that are tying directly into Halo 4
13haven't sat through a playthrough of halo 3 yet
But I've got the biggest soft spot for space operas anyways.
In the name of Poniator
qtf is this anyways?
...
PONIES DO NOT WAIT
Theres a fine line as a writer of games that has yet to be met. How do you create a game where the players actions matter in the long run, but still present a story? Everytime there is a branch of potential paths, you have to write more story to cover both the original (or intended path) heads, as well as the new path. Each an every time
GET ON WITH IT!
YES GET ON WITH IT
i know little of halo, but halo 3 ends with the flood problem being solved iirc
/me hands out torches and pitchforks to chat.
YEAAAAAH
I cannot help liking stuff with awesome high-tech spaceships and lazers and things.
so not sure where you can go from there

1,11Unnr, play Fallout New Vegas. Your actions in that game have long term effects on every faction that you can and will interact with, fusing actions with story conseqsuences rather well.
Franek12354: that was longer than War in Peace
IT JUST GOES ON AND ON MY FRIEND

Can I still send mine in?
Oh yeah
CLOUD CHASER
umm no I dont
Oh mai

Cloud Chaser
no idea
Allegr0: Cloud Chase
Ohhh
00,02cloudchaser i think
just to be clear though, i wasnt saying portal 1 is a bad game, its a great game actually and its one of my favorite games ever. i just dont think its the best of all time

dat pinkie lol. would be fitting for me
It was a massive improvement from Fallout 3, where the story wasn´t that of the vault dweller, but that of hir father´s
hes programming a new spyro game thats supposed to be like the original trilogy
00,02i have a key for smite beta
00,02cant make the thing work
1,11really? Because being randomly attacked by powerful legion assholes and finding that there are a lot of story arcs that you f**ked over by previous actions makes it pretty important.
1,11Unnr: Hir?

Hm, Shizu...I think the transition could use a bit of work.
13i thought of having the skyrim clip there but it works better to punch the second half of the bgm

how did you get another?
13the blink works, there's just only one pair of clips that have it atm
