As a character
Ok, I'm out of here. Bye silly filles!:D
I get it now G4 RD and Rarity are sisters
Seperated at birth

How come he took the easy way for that level and not the minecart one?
He probably forgot about that one

Ponies randomly come on at different times.
Yeah... That's how it worked out for me.
derp
But I never demanded for ponies oddly enough.
i sense a ragequit.
Maybe there should be a disclaimer on the site that ponies may or may not be present at the time of one's visit.
There is, in the FAQ
FAQ is here for a reason.
No one reads the rules and FAQ page. :P
Ninjazz,yes, to not be read.
Just like the rules.
00,10we have rules?!
Not last night for me.
/me is afk

i dont think ehe knows :3
Rage quit!

REG QUIT!
I knew it.
No one reads the FAQ and Rules page, like the Terms of Agreement and Privacy Policies :P
^ this
The Itunes Terms and Conditions is hilarious
and Disclaimers
i read the rules and faq because it isnt 80 friggen pages long
LOL

A quiz? lol
You mean, like a Agree and Disagree button?
00,10yep
00,10and after you hit agree it brings up a quiz and you cant go back to look at the rules
Ooh, nice :P
Oh. Asking that the software not be used for anything "mission critical"? I saw that in other programs too.
If they make a hacking tool instead of just answering manually then they're rather dumb lol ;)
Hmmmm. That would suck...
hahahahahaha
