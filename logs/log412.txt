ValtheJean: you said it yourself, apparently if it doesn't follow THE OFFICIAL RULES OF WRITING ANYTHING THAT MUST NEVER BE BROKEN it's horseshit
.-.
sea pony lyra make everything better
NAZI
2,14 Except I never said that. At all :P
ur wittle brother has a big cut across his chest
i bet i could make a great fanfic without experience
Is...Toasties a Bot?
hmm
2,14 but thanks for misinterpretting my words ;)
Aircrafter: LOL:D
Ooo
ValtheJean: Actually, now I'm curious. What do you read, exactly?
Thank god I have an android 8D
...
ValtheJean: that's hyperbole though. You did say you don't like fanfiction because it doesn't follow the rules of writing. You did, that much I remember.
brb guys !
I've only read My little Dashie, but I thought it was decent, pretty good actually~!
Shane377: O.O poor baby:'( what happend
wait, who doesn't read fanfic?
Drooooiid
Well DeathStar pretty much said she's a NZer or at least lives here
2,14 no, I never said it doesn't follow the rules of writing
2,14 I said it's POOR writing
Dark_Horst: plenty of people.
Dark_Horst: ValtheJean despises fanfictions
Dark_Horst: Do yourself a favour, don't get involved
Life needs moar Chrysalis
ValtheJean: looks like som eone enver read fallout:equestria
ValtheJean: yet Fallout Equestria.
on EQD the revealed the creator of queen chrysalis creator
swiss cheese legs
i was cutting some stuff and the knfie slipped and yea
i agree CCCP xD
2,14 Fallout Equestria is a piece of shit
Digitalis: /)
<@ValtheJean> Fanfics by definition have poor writing
:O
MahBoi777: lol
Seriously ValtehJean, what do you read? I'd like to see your standards.
/me kisses Shane377 better
(\ i'm totally in love with her character design
there thats what was said
ValtheJean: that is BULL it's a good damn story
i think i broke my laptop :(
2,14 if you think that is the holy grail of fanfics, you need a different messiah
DaringDude: as wrek would say, asskisser.
2,14 hah
lol
2,14 hahaha
guys if you dont like somethin pls keep it to urself
2,14 AHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA
ValtheJean: did you read it?
again..
2,14 oh god, that was funny
CCCP: you think they whistle when she flies?:D
not really just the truth
GUYS
MahBoi777: XD
2,14 and yes Dark_Horst, I did
soooooo?
Val's at least partially right. FO:E is not at all a masterpiece. Still enjoyable, though.
ValtheJean: I don't think it's the holy grail of fanfics, but it's a good read that kept me coming back. I also hold The Hobbit as the best book I have ever read
ValtheJean: What exactly do you read? To what standard do you hold all writing?
OMG I READ THE HOBBIT
Reikim: yeah, well ValtheJean over there is saying it's utter garbage.
ITS SO GOOD
WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE< WE GOT GAMES To- Oh wait
2,14 and you're welcome to think so. Doesn't make it good writing
sis does ur mum kno u watch mlp
My friend from school works on fallout equestria :)
so, you're going to tell me, with a straight face, that fallout: equestria doesn't have good writing?
2,14 because it is
2,14 I believe I did, yes
I hope you all know... I am the Great Mighty Poo.
cupcakes is best fan fic
DeadlyPon3: Guns N Roses ftw
this man is delusional
O_o
DaringDude: that's awesome
i like fan fics, even if they are usually poorly written i still find them fun to read. Actually really bad fan fics are sometimes really funny.
FlareChaser: good to know
ValtheJean: and what RULES OF WRITING do you have to PROVE that is IS not good writing? What EVIDENCE of HARD AND CLINICAL NATURE do you produce besides what we hear as YOUR OPINION.
LYra
LYRA GET OUT OF THE WARZONE
guys areyou even listening to me
ValtheJean: If you cannot give us a single example of "good" writing, I will be writing down your opinion as unfounded horseshit created to troll us. A possibility I am seriously considering.
2,14 because it is BY DEFINITION poor
OH DONT THROW SHIT AT ME flarechaser
:) So....how were those live G4 ponies
RUN LYRA. ITS THE NAZZYS
ValtheJean: BY WHAT DEFINITION!?
lol
2,14 It is taking someone ELSES work, and twisting it to feed your own ego
ValtheJean: where did you see such a definition
we still yelling about fan fics?
My holy God, you guys will find anything to argue about while this is on
yeah they are
:'(
LOL
PLEASE STOP FIGHTING :[ NOW. This isnt the ways Bronies should act like to one another!
Bai Lyra
Best fanfic ever, right here: http://pastebin.com/LziHFE3Y
/me dances
/me wants to change topics
Calcos323: fighting IS magic
there's a fight?? where?!
Love and Tolerate thy brony
2,14 god...Please don't start spouting Love and Tolerance now -_-
No, That's Lyra biting ya
MOTHER F##### JUST STOP FRIKIN FIGHTIN
:)
/me waits for ValtheJean's response
eww don't say that
XD
lol
Band of Brothers...I may stay up late tonight...nevermind tomorrow's delivery schedule
Krakass: TL;DR
CCCP: Sure, but it isn't love and tolerance
2,14 response to what Reikem?
"spouting love and tolerance" wow
CCCP: lol same
ValtheJean: What's your standard? What do you consider good writing?
Calcos323: you should love and tolerate no tolerance
CCCP, you don't know what you're mssing out on. It's the only fanfic Val actually likes.
MahBoi777: :3
xD
inb4 snoipa
CCCP: I do when I play Street Fighter
ValtheJean: so, every side story EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY of stories is bullshit eh? since that's all a fanfic is, a side story really. I guess that means all of the fan music is SHIT, all of the fan art is SHIT and all of the fan games are SHIT because they AREN'T DONE BY THE ORIGINAL CREATORS by your rules. Thank you for single-handedly destroying a fandom.
2,14 something that isn't a fanfic. And probably a few other exceptions
NAZZY
Krakass: okay than i guess i will read it later (bookmarks)
NATSEES
haha xD
Wow, someone actually fell for my lie.
Calcos323: lol
:(
good Fanfics can exist, i see no reason why it cant, i know of no definition that would imply otherwise
Did we stop Fighting? Good. Thanks.
/me supports otakon
CLOPFICS ARE TERRIBLE
"I'm a sad german :'(
I'm back baby
lol clopfics are hilarious
RoflBot: well, that goes without saying I think.
^
i did nazi that coming
ValtheJean: See, if you'd said Shakespeare or something, I would have just accepted that you have high standards. You can't give me a single actual work of literature, and so your opinion is unfounded.
clop fic are awesome!
DARN NAZZY
...
Lyra should be here, she can handle all of it
Anyone played CoD on this map?
ValtheJean: so you completely negelct the possibility that someone has writing talent just because he doesn't sell it overpriced and overhyped?
woah we have a fight here
Well, its bed time for this pony. Good night!! Take care and enjoy ValtheJean 's Lovely stream!! :)
2,14 so I have to start naming works to support myself?
mario_pony: jew mad?
Just as long as she doesn't break our cover...AAGAIN
I apologize for going on a tangent.
I didn't know you can burn juice
Generalzing can possibly some times be negative, Being negative can posibly be bad
dat ambush
Roflbot, don't even go there
ValtheJean: well, an example would be nice.
ValtheJean: bad works wont support your point.
2,14 if that's what you require Reikem, you can go fuck yourself over your stupidity
kill dem nazeees
NIght RaveBrony don't let NMM or Molestia bite
ValtheJean: dude overkill
ValtheJean X Reikim
ouch, really ValtheJean?
ValtheJean: Evidence is the basis of argument, yes. You can't give us a concrete example, so we have nothing solid to base your opinion on.
lol... go on the clear road
3So, wait, what does fanfics have to do with BoB?
NAZIIIIIIISS!!!!!
CCCP best shipping lol
^
/me waves bye to everypony :)
ALL OF YOU ARE IDIOTS. ALL OF YOU
@ValtheJean , don't speak to Reikim like that !
Daring-doom: :D
...BoB has everything to do with it
ValtheJean: Basically you're just trolling.
Calcos323: ok
CoD CAMPING SPOTS
LYra, GIVE US COVERING FIRE!
2,14 uh huh

CCCP: a match made in heaven:D
FlareChaser: I will :D
lol
REAL couples HATE each other
Lyra, asist asist
Alright Bye RaveBrony :)
GDI don't bring CoD in here
Opposites attract
TROW A FRAG! TRHOW A FRAG!
MahBoi777: ikr! XD

CoD aint got SHIT on this
the movie reminds me of the chat
Caramel sure knows how to sleep through mass murder wars
Lyra, take cover!
bye RaveBrony
COD PONYS
lol
PEW PEW PEW
Lesson Learned: Don't fight with Mods.
Honestly, what is it about BoB and this chat that makes everyone want to argue?
SlurryMoon: ValtheJean says ALL fanfics are shit by definition, which basically means by extension ALL fanworks are shit. Because they weren't done by the original creators and only made "to stroke the creator's ego" as he said earlier.
lyra
look Lyra is helping
LRYA NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
FlareChaser: wrong lesson.
Alright I got mIRC to work
whats that weird sound?
Calcos323: waht's BoB?
FlareChaser: Well, at least he didn't play the pre-G4 ponies. So we're good.
RoflBot: machinegun fire
Goddammit Everypony! JUST http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8/
Lyra, ATTACK!
otakon: Band of Brothers, what we're watching right now
Haha!!
3cool, I would recommend you all drop it and watch some BoB with me, sound good?
otakon: if youre right, then thats bullshit
2,14 I only mentioned writing Otakon. That's simply you extracting more than what was said
run Lyra!
Calcos323: oh
can we take a vote
"There's one right *Died*"
3I don't want a useless arguement in here
MEDIC!
lol
SlurryMoon: agrreed
Anyways, I think imma go now too Guys, I have had enough of Royal capterlot voices today.
Lyra swims towards the enemies
Watch our Lyra's out of the bucket1
ValtheJean: how is writing different from drawing for example
13drama drama drama
well said slurryMoon
lol
ValtheJean: well, but by your reasoning the same "truth" holds true for ANY fan work.
Thanks, SlurryMoon. Let's watch some awesome
"owie!"
lol
Le me watching the argument
POW
lol
nice fail shot
2,14 because there are different standards and applications of such
SCootallo DOWN!
da scootaloos noooo
Alright Goodbye! and Remember! Flare Chaser x Colgate, Okay cya :)
One last comment for Val's sake: G4 is essentially Faust's own fanfiction. Okay, now I'm done.
Not the chickens!.
-has my Seapony on screen and The Streamers, not sure which is mine-
2,14 you can't compare a book, for example, and say that it is a good painting
lol was that laser gun sounds?
ownd
Dat Hero...?
bye flarechaser!
FlareChaser , don't let her bite
XD
DeathStar
howdy y'all
Lyra, Cover your sector, MOVE IT MOVE IT MOVE IT
ValtheJean: yeah a book isnt a painting, no shit
Shane377
howdy THE
hi THE
O hai THE
in english australia do we spell honor with or with a u?
Caramel! Soldier, Stop sleeping on the Job!
2,14 yeah, so don't fucking apply *my* standards for writing to painting
ValtheJean: the point is that there can be people just as talented as Hasbro working on fanfics
inb4 everyone arguing with a mod is banned
hows everypony doin?
Hello all! :)
ValtheJean: When did painting come into this? Because I'm experienced with that, too.
I am happy
THE: Just. Fine.
Hello Storm_Chaser! (waves)
oh hai Storm_Chaser
OH CRAP a fight
hi Storm_Chaser , THE
Storm_Chaser: Hi :3
hi Storm_Chaser.
THE: great and you?
13mfw val using *bold* is unreadable
someone i here is being a dick
13light blue on dark grey
hey Storm_Chaser!
lol
ValtheJean: just as painting, or writing, or composing- there are talented people who arent working for Hasbro, hence good works can exist
Daww
2,14 oiy....don't make me go back into the logs...that's work I'm not interested in doing
Hello everypony! ;)
what is this movie?
thats good im good
Hiii Sparkle-Pone.
hi Sparkle-Pone
..."GRENADE IT!"
Commander_Shepard: Band of Brothers.
2,14 but if they were to write a fanfic, they would not be one of those talented people
"THERE ARE PEOPLE IN IT :O!"
How is everyone?
Band of Brothers. People should watch instead of drama storm.
EXTREME!!!!!
?
2,14 because if they were a GOOD writer, they would not write fanfics
ValtheJean: G4 is Faust's own fanfic, dammit. At least admit that.
ValtheJean: LOL you think everyone talented is succesful???????
anyone here play halo
What?
2,14 she was contracted by the authorized owner to create FiM
EXTREME
/me hugs MahBoi777, Alister, WallMaster, TheRainbowDash, OmegaMetroidBrony, and Aircrafter tightly "How are you all?"
2,14 that is not fanfiction
ValtheJean: yeah, but you can judge a "good" painting from a "bad" painting. You are saying one section of writing is inherently "shit" by no ohter standards then it being shit. Since EVERY DAMN STORY EVER copies off of something from earlier, everything is technically fanwork then. Writers are inspired by stuff they read, they make their own stories that incorporate ideas.
Storm_Chaser: Awesome, and you?:)
Dishwasher_EXTREME: yesh, I love it
ValtheJean: But did the story come before or after the contract?
Hello Storm_Chaser: !
Storm_Chaser: TwilightLicious. Just TwilightLicious. You?
ValtheJean: do you know how many brilliant people create without a job?
ValtheJean: the thing is that you are completely excluding the possibility that someone has writing talent becasue he doesn't sell his stuff. overpriced, in most of the cases. that is pretty narrow-minded
Reikim : Welll actually THEY proposed her to write the show
Pretty good Storm_Chaser
2,14 when did I say selling?
oh gawd his leg
There goes his LEG
Storm_Chaser: honestly, been better.
there goes his leg
welp, thats his leg.
Hello DrGNs
what we talking about now?
i think i'm going to have a future career making shows
dat leg
ValtheJean: fanfiction. it usually doesn't get sold
ValtheJean: Never.
ValtheJean: didn't Lauren say that the ideas for the current ponies came from her own "adventures" she had when she was a kid?
Damn Nazi's
"i'm okay"
how is he still in one piece
I'VE HAD IT WITH THIS MOTHERFUCKING SHITSTORM IN THIS MOTHERFUCKING STREAM !
there some serious fight between valthejean and otakon
LOL
2,14 >serious
2,14 >fight
It's just a flesh wound!
BAH dammit LimeV
Dishwasher_EXTREME: it's not a fight, it's a discussion
2,14 okay....
Alister: It's the stream content. Seems to be cursed.
MOLESOT
YAY :D
MOLESTOR
Eveyrhting is oaky :P
hell, at worst it's a debate
Wait...what...:D
sound like a fight to me
His junk is right there
I'm pretty good, just ran out of ideas for stories, so i'm continuing the ones i have running/have yet to publish the first chapter :D
:'(
shot in the dick but his dicks still standing
ValtheJean: and really, that's the only differenc ebetween regular books and fanfiction. one gets sold, the other doesn't. that doesn't mean they can't reach similar levels in quality
YAY HIS PENIS ISN'T GONE
sounds like a fight to me to, with insults
LOL
otakon: in a debate someone wins so it's not that
ITS A FREE FOR ALL FIGHT FIGHT !!!!
Hiiyo e- HOLY SHIT BAND OF BROTHERS! AGAIN! :D
Lyra...Check it out
Calcos323: O HAPPY DAY
OH SNAP
lol
LOOK OUT FOR NAZZYS
Dayum!
2,14 Dark_horst: that comparison is insulting to me. If you choose to believe that, then we have nothing more to discuss
Lyra gives no fucks\
lol nazzys
the only one with an rpg iskilled
LYRA NO
EATS MAGIC !!!!
ValtheJean: just admit it's your opinion and be done with it
What episode is this?
mfw i leave for 5 mins and arguing still going on
To Everypony using Total Caps: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1572/
THIS SUMMER, Michael Bay brings you Exploding Sheds
http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/157566
Lyra eats bullets
otakon: you think it'll end like that?
HIS FACE
Ouch...
oh god
dat explosion
Reikim: I would hope
http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/157566
ValtheJean: well, that's the message you're bringing across the whole time
Dear Lord....
god damn
Hmm, looks a tad bit painful...
Again, what episode is this?!
2,14 Otakon: uh-huh. You saying that means you haven't paid attention to anything I've said
Oh my god! His eye!
This is powerful stuff
ive seen
He doesn't die...
His Friggin leg bro!
lol medic
3mmm... alright I've had it with this conversation. Either take it to PM and let us watch this show, or just shut up.
what the argument now?
ive seen worse!!! on 4chan!
Why can't we all just quit complaining and be friends....
Dat action priest :P
this is some fuck up shiit
Aircrafter: ikr
(Bible sold sepereatly)
SlurryMoon: thank you :)
^
I haz no arguments
Seeing men suffering from war like that reminds of the WW1. Women were portesting for equal rights while MEN WERE FORCED TO GO DIE
I agree SlurryMoon
Ok, now THAT'S just cruel!
Wait what is happening in the chat? Too busy watching the awesomeness of the Band of Brothers on the stream!:)
...
SlurryMoon is right, creating a room for all further discussion #ARGUMENTS
What movie is this you guys??
Why did you need to do that?
Wave 3 complete
PONY
this reminds me of nam...
Sparkle-Pone: not a movie
Shining armor??????
3Reikim, don't link other chatrooms
such an adorable babby cadence
ValtheJean: you are saying that all fanfiction is shit for NO other reason then it being fanfiction. That's like saying all animated show are for children because they are animated.
wtf, show?
LOOK ITS RARITY
RARITY IS IN THIS
Sparkle-Pone: This isn't a movie. It's a Tv show
Nam = not any meaning
SlurryMoon: Sorry, didn't know. My apologies.
2,14 Again, different mediums. Different standards
D'awwww
why does my vid keep saying "we r doin maintenance
<3
This shit is hardcore for tv :O
My heart just exploded
2,14 you can't compare an orange to an apple's standard
LOL lyra
Sparkle-Pone: It's a 12 part series, each an hour long
What?
dat censor
if i recall this was on HBO
ValtheJean: But you can compare it to the fruit standard.
vietnam...
Lyra censor for the toast!:)
Lyra censoring for the fillies
/me dances
/me does not give any bucks about EQD
I can see where Val's coming from. On the Good Vs Crap scale, Fanfiction is most often 1:99999
wtf, an hour long? Sooo, it's a short flim?
screw it i'm installing steam
mario_pony: DO EEEET!
2,14 and by that definition, Reikem, fanfiction is something created
CCCP: I am!!
http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/145824
Fanfiction is only good if you have a good imagination... with no porn
RAWRity: We're not debating that. We're debating absolutes. We all freely admit to Sturgeon's Law.
mario_pony: yay! :D
Sparkle-Pone: No, it's still a Tv serires. Just a really long one. Again, 12 parts so not a movie
what about it pumkinmrpackman
RAWRity: though, the argument is that he is convinced that such thing as good fanfiction cannot exist
ValtheJean: What definition?
why is all the porn gone....
ValtheJean: so you say that it is impossible that someone talented will make a fanfiction?
OmegaMetroidBrony, it's a script/bot.
Murphys Law = only True law
ValtheJean: then give me a damn official ruling that fanfiction is not a legitimate bit of writing for people. Give me an example of Harvard saying it should never be considered literature or somthing. Until then, it's just your opinion and your being too damn vocal about it and insulting other people for liking it on the grounds that it is not good or bad but JUST because it's fanfiction.
2,14 talented in writing, yes
yeah but still!
however, Fanfics CAN be good. It's just that most with enough talent to write well and tell a good story have usually preogressed to the point where they're working on original stories.
CCCP: i just hope it doesn't makemy computer explode
Seriously...
/me doesn't give a buck about the newest EQD posts
ValtheJean: proof?
Fanfictions can be good if you put so much work into it
/me gives everpony a rope to climb over the wall of text
CCCP: /)
OmegaMetroidBrony: thats nice dear
So what's the name of it? I don't want to get hooked and never find it, lol
Well, that applies to anything really
I'm tied of all the shitstorm. I'm going to bed. G'night Everypony ! and yes OmegaMetroidBrony , I know what you'll say : so yes send Season 2 luna
mario_pony: my computer sucks and it didn't do that to mine!
Sparkle-Pone: of what?
I'm still trying to figure out what definition I gave that ValtheJean was referring to.
SunderlandPony89: (\
Sparkle-Pone: It's called Band of Brothers
2,14 good grief Otakon. That's like saying I have to go get Da'Vinci to approve of every art medium
night Alister sleep well
Night Alister
night Alister
oh man...
I'm tired of these arguments that serve into no purpose of getting anywhere.:)
That face
Night Alister
i cant see... i can only see ponys sir...
gnight Alister
OOOOH, is this from HBO?
/me hugs TheRainbowDash :)
God, this is making me tear up
TheRainbowDash: They're called debates, FYI
HBO ponies
Blithe, don't worry, Lyra will cheer ya up :D
I believe so
They're just fucking pointless.
Night Alister, we'll let you know if the flames die down
Alister, I don't send ponies... I tell which ones to avoid
and night
Cadance reminds me of G3.5 Scootaloo
ValtheJean: I..don't get that logic. Somebody who's a talented writer can't write fanfiction? Huh?
TheRainbowDash: no hugs? :(
I think he means he wants some kind of concrete proof
OmegaMetroidBrony : ok then
(hugs CCCP) There...:D
2,14 no, someone who's a talented writer WONT write fanfiction
ValtheJean: how can you say that no talent would be writing a fanfic? maybe he feels like sharing it with a solid community liek bronies to test himself? thats an example of how its possible.
:$
lol
talented writers could write fan fiction
/me huggles TheRainbowDash and CCCP ^-^
wat
awww DaringDude :)
Well, Talented Writers can write shit
from the hair color?
SunderlandPony89: I seen what was written in the chat lately, and it has gotten too far, beyond debate..
So
ValtheJean: that, and excuse me when i put it that way, is a quite stupid point of view
>_(\
Won't? As in, if they were real writers they wouldn't?
2,14 Dark_Horst: because?
OH TOO MUCH HUG MOLESTER !!!! WE GOT A MOLESTER HERE!!
ValtheJean: Gotta disagree. If anything, fanfiction can be a great way to hone a writer's skill or improve themselves.
ValtheJean: i showed an example of how its possible.
gimmie dat
Howdy y'all.
Well Bye Everypony, Be on Tomorrow.
LYRA PONY IS IN THE WAY!

Discord must be somewhere in this chat,lol
bye Aircrafter
bye alll the people who are going to bed
Why not?
ValtheJean Good Writers can write shit sometimes ^^' doesn't mean a good writer can write shakespeare doesn't mean they have the need to expand their own idea of a creation
ValtheJean: there is no such thing as perfect.
94%!!

Scoot doesn't have the yellow though.
TheRainbowDash: Man, Toast <_<

What?
this debate is goin on and on

YEAH TOAST
What are we watching?
Tacos > Toast
otakon: But there is such thing as trying to get to it, it is called goals and purposes in life.:)
Everlasting_Joy: Band of Brothers
Everlasting_Joy: band of brothers
this is weard
2,14 Otakon: I already have. It's taking OTHER people's work, which is half-assing the creative process
Lyra:" What ya talking about guys?"
Dark_Horst Thanks :).
OmegaMetroidBrony: got the right idea :D]
Waffles>Tacos>Toast
ValtheJean is either trolling or cant prove his point, he repeats the same things over and over, even though i provided an example to prove my point.
my one question about poniez?
hey Everlasting_Joy
i agree this is weird
ValtheJean: saying that proves that you have NOT read fallout equestria
Shane377: yes?
11,02i liek poniez ^-^

Yeah, we may not be perfect at something otakon, but what is the definition of perfect to you?
My dad makes the most badass tacos and Hai SuperBrony64
SuperBrony64|SCHOOL: O RLY?
hey SB!
'┐(￣ー￣)┌
11,02Hai :D
13or imma get the pool noodle
ValtheJean: so, would you say all modern comic book writers who work with pre-established characters are "half-assing" it?
11,02:<
2,14 Dark_Horst: It was the VERY first fanfic I read when a similar discussion happened here months ago
SuperBrony64: you do me too :O
TheRainbowDash: no one is perfect
MahBoi777 This late night hello is what all true warriors strive FOUR!
/me hugs SuperBrony64
2,14 so don't make a claim that isn't true
not the noodle!
/me hugs CupcakeWarrior

/me hugs SuperBrony64
11,02OmegaMetroidBrony: I want a taco now :3
/me hugs CCCP ^_^
we all do superbrony64
otakon: I see that, but does that make us normal and unique to each other?
Everlasting_Joy: O U
20 guys? That's a lot of ammo
2,14 RAWRity: not when they're contracted by the actual owners of the copyright
SuperBrony64: ponies are arguing :'( hold me
/me special hugs SuperBrony64
whats this aboyt 'perfection"
Moo
ohai Everlasting_Joy!
/me gives SuperBrony64 a taco
...
CHAOS
TO SUM UP: Val thinks the entire concept of fanfiction is disgusting, and has actually provided some arguments to support his opinion, which means it is in fact valid. Some of us believe that the underlying writing itself can still be good, regardless of whether or not it's actually fanfiction. And that has some basis too. And in the end it comes down to a difference in beliefs. So now everyone, PLEASE SHUT UP. And I mean EVERYO
ValtheJean: youre making a claim that isnt true.
ValtheJean: so what you're saying is, it's only half-assing if you're not paid to do it?
oh gawd
11,02Lol, reading sucks in general :3
All of you.
ok in the episode where mr and mrs cake had kids mrs cake didnt look pregnant <--??? u never see pregnant poniez wierd
/me falls out of chat
All these delayed "hi"s :).
lmao xD
TheRainbowDash: I don't know. I say there is no normal, only an average
The best tacos are made by Mexicans and my dad is one. :3
DaringDude: this is crazy, lol
OMG TOO MUCH MOLESTER
lol dat SB, a child of the future :P
SuperBrony64: oh u
go kill your self superbrony
WHOA
we never saw mr, mrs cake before
Superbrony64 I am so tired :'( Spend my whole day at a local community college
2,14 RAWRity: No, it means it can't be good without the consent of its creator
/me gives SuperBrony64 a rope to climb over the walls of text
04The only thing worth reading: The Catcher in the Rye. That is all
Dat ded chat
pumkinmrpackman: woah, what was that for?
UNCALLED FOR BRO
2,14 without the consulting and guidance of the person who made it
03what the frick
03everybody's leaving
This channel needs more semicolons
pumkinmrpackman: do you need a hug?
11,02Ghosties: Wut dat? :3
;
there are many good sci-fi books
SunderlandPony89: IT'S ALIVE
well that was rude and uncalled for sir
and there goes my question
/me runs away
SUPERBRONY
/me dances on SuperBrony64 s head
Ghosties: I didn't like it. Main character was a uninteresting boor if you ask me.
otakon: Normal is also an abstract idea too. "We are not weak, but we are now perfect. We are strong. We are human." - My Quote:)
Omgod what is this
YAY
ValTheJean Why would you think that? I am curious
(not)
;)
2,14 no one. NO ONE, can understand any character to the same degree as the person who created them
SuperBrony64 ish a silleh filleh
11,02I love The Catcher in the Rye ^-^
Hey everypony! How did your day treat you
/me forces DeathStar off Sb64's head
Oh wait
TheRainbowDash: nice
; )
There
Ghosties: phony!
ValtheJean: if that is true, than you'd know that kkat did not halass someone's else work. fallout equestria developed into something of it's own design in a few chapters. the only thing it had in common then was the nuclear war szenario. and if you say writing something about a nuclear fallout is halfassing someone else's work, you might as well say that writing something with space-ships is stealing from star wars
hi DerpStar
13dis drama in mane chat..
Shane377: :'(
lol
hey DerpStar!
dat wall
damnt dat text wall
Hey DerpStar!
SuperBrony64 Ive never heard of it
/me gets a ladder for text wall
ValtheJean: what. Whaaaaat. So you're saying without consulting the creators, it can't be considered good? Well I guess that means the LOTR movies are bad.
hi DerpStar
oh hai DerpStar
Thats why we have this haven
its a free for all cage match EVERYBODY TYPE AS MUCH AS U CAN
Dammit, you all ignored me
GRR
/me high fives Digitalis
ValtheJean: not true, a good analytic will understood a character perfectly, characters have finite complexity.
Good night and good arguing!
Come stay in regulars chat....come join us
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
/me dances on SuperBrony64 s head some more
13makes me want to get the pool noodle und smack a colt
/me huggles TheHoodyNinja
im sorry Reikim
2,14 RAWRity: again, different mediums
oh shit
Why must I type?
bye commie
Join us......
Shane377: I'm sorry I did not see ur wuestion
ValtheJean: try telling that to the writers of the end of Mass Effect 3 and the dozens of peopel that have written endings that make more damn sense.
What seems to be the debate here, just out of curiosity?
/me hugs Reikim
Night CCCP
night CCCP
Jun you troll :P
Night CCCP Don't let NMM or Molestia bite
gnight CCCP
ValTheJean It's still the same idea of Writing it down
2,14 if Peter Jackson had re-written the Lord of the Rings Series, then it would be shit
im not leaving btw :P
Pool noodle? sounds like something with a story behind it
HE DID
otakon: This is what I see humans, but, look at this, what if we make too many mistakes? Or have too many weaknesses? That is what seperates us from being perfect, and from being reaching our true selves in life.:)
Night CCCP.
Everlasting_Joy: its not worth knowing
2,14 no, they are entirely different mediums
guys a question about poniez in a episode mr and mrs cake had a kid mrs cake didn t look pregnant
goodnight cc
i stay UNLIKE SOME ;P
/me hides
damn he left
Good Night CCCP :)
Peter Jackson rewrote it to fit the Big screen
RAWRity: actually that different medium argument is bull
ValtheJean: you can't keep using that as your shield, just because it's a differnet mediumd.
DaringDude Fair enough.
Everlasting_Joy: Fanfic war keep your head down!:D
...
TheRainbowDash: that's a little too deep for me man.
otakon: he doesnt have anything else...
03dunno if you saw earlier
RAWRity: sorry, meant to ping ValtheJean
03but I got a radio show
13it's from three IRC networks ago... the ops would threaten to beat us bloody with wet noodles, eventually mutated into specifically wet pool noodles
2,14 why? You're saying the standards for what makes a good movie is exactly the same as a book?
:D
CCCP>.....funny that word when spell backwards is short for the fire department in my country
03Friday nights from 7-9
Yes
2,14 if you believe that, you're an idiot
MahBoi777 Oh jeez! Abandon chat!
Awesome
lol
03yeah
Mahboi777 pretty much summed it up
when do you start
otakon: Ok then. Good that I can share that with you.
03I start on Firday
03XD
ValTheJean Whoah
ValtheJean: no, but dammit they are similar.
XD
Shane377 well the winter wrap up episode had a nice summer before it and fall right after
03this Friday
Don't call us idiots
val you need to calm your pants.
2,14 Sure, they're similar
/me hugs SuperBrony64 "arguing ponies makes me sad" :'(
and steam is installed :
03I just have to turn in these waivers and stuff saying I won't break FCC laws
*:)
2,14 that doesn't mean they should be weighed the same
well i can see a bunch of people in here and i also see an idiot. sorry
HUZZAH
Here, here DeathStar
i'll definitely tune in.
Sea-pony Lyra with a ducky? My heart!
ikr
03OK
I swear I remember hearing "beat you with a wet noodle" in a videogame somewhere
2,14 have fun with that Dark_Horst
03I'll give the stream when it gets closer
DerpStar so ur saying she could of had a belly but we didnt see it
ok!
Sea pony Lyra is EVIL!
03there's like 3 of them
Exactly time distortion
you get to be on actual radio lucky you :P
what a waste of time this is
whats wrong DeathStar
DeathStar: awww, it's gonna be k
im on an INTERNET one XD
03one that uses a regular website, one for iTunes/Winamp and one for WMP
03I think they're all the same thing
ValtheJean: tell me, did you deliberately ignore all of my claims?
03just differnet streams
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2459/

Shane377: I dont like arguing enles it's silly

03it can be a talk show too
TheHoodyNinja: lol
HEY LOOK EVERYONE A PONY HERE HAVE A PONY AND SHUT UP http://derpy.me/58Bhj
is like WWII in this place
ValtheJean: POINT 1: not true, a good analytic will understood a character perfectly, characters have finite complexity.
03but my show is going to be 80s and 90s music basically
/me hugs SuperBrony64 back
what were people arguing about?
Dishwasher_EXTREME: Say again, please
WHERE IS THE PIECE!
PEACE!
*
Ooo, this is Carenten!
ah ok
/me gives DeathStar and a SuperBrony64 a hug
2,14 Twilight: Okay, I'll play the same thing you've been spouting at me: prove that
Shane377: fanfics but inan un silly way
CHAOS
ValtheJean: there are numerous comics that have been made without the consultation of the original author, because they were dead. Does that mean that anything printed after the character's creator's death, they cannot be good?
is like WWII in this place...
ValtheJean: POINT 2:how can you say that no talent would be writing a fanfic? maybe he feels like sharing it with a solid community liek bronies to test himself? thats an example of how its possible.
Shane377: that fanfiction by default is shit regardless of the actual quatlity of the work.
That quote = EVIL
Ewww
...
Ok...
And one special for ValtheJean, please drop this; I can't get everyone else to drop it, but if you stop then the rest of it stops. http://derpy.me/F4bjE
Dishwasher_EXTREME: Well this show takes place during WWII...
omg stop spamming chat with pointless convos about fanfics
Ok what is this argument even about
Why bother convicning someone who is so headset on not changing. Valthejean Please stop baiting them if you hate argueing
Here is my thought.
2,14 Again Twilight, please give me an example where that is the case
when you think about it... some fanfics result in shows
Both sides are good. I am a moderate, the end.:)
ValtheJean: LOL did you even read what i said?
SERIOUSLY WHATS GOING ON!
ValtheJean: that WAS an example
uhhh what noo im talking about the stream
RoflBot: welp, they must be shit then by Val.
2,14 no, that was a theoretical situation
TheRainbowDash: Neutral ftw!:D
13can everypony just relax...
2,14 proove that it happens
....
Oh damn
ValtheJean: prove that it cant.
whee Kyu XD
TheHoodyNinja: Debate on fanfiction versus stories? (I think)
Gentlemen rest your sphincters!
Shizuka: aparently not :(
I WILL KILL ALL OF YOU WITH A PILLOW!
Hi every pony im back
ValtheJean: i see no reasons why its impossible
O.O
Shizuka, Please tell ValtheJean to stop baiting them!
TheRainbowDash: Arent they the same thing?
Not the pillow!:O
oh hai PrncsLuna
TheHoodyNinja, calm down lol xD
ValtheJean: seems liek an ordinary situation, a writer wants feedback on his writing
Shizuka is best U.P advisor
2,14 so you're just going to spin that then? because you really can't expect standards in me that you don't hold yourself to
someone thought my Gyarados Lucario core for my VGC team was interesting
welcome back, PrncsLuna
This is why I join in other channels.
TheHoodyNinja: ValtheJean says fanfiction by definiton is garbage regardless of the actual quality of the fanfiction.
/me pulls out pillow in self defence
/me pats DeathStar on the back 'there there'
ValtheJean: seems liek an ordinary situation, a writer wants feedback on his writing
Sorry TheHoodyNinja Sea Pony Lyra is already trying to kill me
Val.. fan fic is like the show that is being streamed... these are fictional characters in a war
/me hugs Shane377
^
Iliek the Pinkie Pie room, lol
ValtheJean: Fine. Let's play this. Define good writing.
what RoflBot said
UN= United Nations UP= United Ponies
04ValtheJean does not like fanfiction. There's no point in arguing that, you're not going to change his opinion.
RoflBot: actually, bad example as this is based on real events.
Val, wat you got against fanfics
TheHoodyNinja: Well, I need to understand what is going on in the chat first to vailidate the differences, but I'm nomming on toast/watching the stream/chatting in PM.
Drf: looking at the shoutcast server for that stream....ONLY 20 listener slots ._.
2,14 RoflBot: Firstly, different mediums. Secondly, they consulted with actual veterans about these events
/me pulls out Desert eagle points it side ways at all the peeps who are aruging about fanfics
Ghosties: Personally I just want his definition of good writing. He won't give it, though.
ValtheJean: veterans are biased
2,14 and every named character presented was an actual soldier in the war
DaringDude: lol
13can you guys at least take it to PM..
oh my
2,14 Reikim: I already did, not fanfiction
^
03that's...weird
...
03I don't know how that stuff works
/me got ninja's
fanfics sucks
Shizuka: pm is 1v1, thats the problem
/me * ninja'd
03since it's an actual FM station they aren't as concerned about streaming LOL
Ghosties: it's not that he doesn't like it, it that he always chimes in "FANFICTION IS GARBAGE" whenever he see's it in chat. He holds it like a unbreakable law that cannot be changed lest the universe itself be undone.
ValtheJean: shut up please :3

Hello Malavolent! (waves)
SuperBrony64: O U
11,02:O
left for another min wat happened?
this whole discussion is retarded. Fanfics are not all bad
Shizuka: not the same thing, different medium.
2,14 Reikim: no, hence why I said with possible exceptions (the first time I gave that definition)
mods do i have permission to name a channel for this argument?
11,02icwutudidthar Shizuka :3
Mmmm :(
2,14 we don't own the network twilight
The mods here really don't sleep, do they?
I have no idea as to whats going on here
Malavolent: not usually
Malavolent: Sleep is for the weak
2,14 so long as you follow ponychat's rules, you're welcome to do whatever you want with your own channels
FLUFFY :D
Malavolent: ALWAYS watching
ValtheJean: So you do not, in fact, have a concrete definition for us of what constitutes good writing.
Ghosties: that's not quite the argument here. if he doesn't like fanficton, well, okay. the thing is how he stated that such thing as quality fanfiction is impossible to exist. that talent negates fanfiction. of course that causes discussions and the like
*facepalm* im gonna get a mod from #help
TheHoodyNinja: arguement over the validity of fanfiction
well i need to get everyone in the same channel somehow, dont i
WE ARE ALL WRONG AND FLUTTERSHY IS CUTE END OF DISCUSSION!
Lyra is swimmin :D
Ghosties: or arguments, in this case
SunderlandPony89: So I thought.
DAMNIT twilight_sprinkle I WAS SHOUTING!

Rocklobster: eeyup, we be stubborn

somebody wake up in a bath of ice with one of his kidney removed
oh i lie EVERYWHERE
hi xmasskills
Is Toasties new?
hey xmasskills!
i may have given a bad example, but i still agree with my discussion
ValtheJean: You are criticizing writing based on content. You do not actually address the writing itself. Therefore, your definition is not a definition of good or bad writing.
TheHoodyNinja, yesh
ValtheJean: just say that you do not like fanfiction and leave it at that. Just stop saying fanfiction is shit PERIOD whenever it gets brought up though.
HELLO xmasskills
During an argument about fanfiction, Toasties tells us about fanfic updates. lawl
ValtheJean: i named channel
to the people arguing http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/35x3vb/
well this is still makes me feel bad feelings so im leaving again
Guess who wins out of all of this? Toast.:)
2,14 Otakon: if fanfiction is going to be brought up, I'll express my opinion on it, regardless of whether you agree with it or not

Debates like these can be handled somewhere else, just not in the public. You're actualy ruining other ponie's experiences in the chat by making pointless statements that will get this conversation nowhere.

TheRainbowDash: "death is the only way to escape reality"
Polydunami: seems legit
Nuh uh

I'm incredulous. Is this 3.5?
kirzstryfe: nobody said Bronies don't have the occasional delusions of entitlement.
xmasskills: so true
kirzstryfe: I'm not sure Love and Tolerance can be assumed unfortunately
that is the most retarded flutter pony i've ever seen
umvc3: Brony hell
Im gonna go eat something
This is just G3 I think
Yeah
Dat clever Zipzee
xmasskills: "But religious beliefs believe that any definite logic is false."
...
It's kind of longwinded
at least these things look sort of like ponies.
What the heck?
lol
kirzstryfe: eh, good point. but I do not like this stuff, it's too simple and ......is pretencious a good word? it basically talks down to the viewer, has no character development or real conflict of any kind and really bland songs. it's..........tolerable.
WHERES LUNA
RAWRity: I get the feeling meddling executives are to blame
I like trains.
3.5 looks like if aliens tried to make dogs.
RoflBot: there is no Luna
RAWRity: lol
*
g3 trixie?
lololol trixie
Chrysalis: nope Unfound
That G3 Trixie look alike

otakon: oooooh yes.
TheHoodyNinja: ever remember the big fiasco of Discord?

Mutterguy i think its more of a "people making a big deal over" rather than a fiasco
Polydunami: Bronyland for duture amusement park name, lol

OH GOD. WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS GONE?
She was so weak they didnt even need the elements of harmony lawl

DaringDude one does not simply, sound more like the original
DaringDude: that's Tralala I think..........the ponies don't really stand out to remember their names.
You shouldn't trust strange luring smells in a cave
xmasskills: Just a lot of pain
GhostBoi777: Oh god, the horrors xD

Did someone ask Sumica for ponies... -.-
otakon so Ditzy sounds more like g4 pinkie pie then g3 pinkie pie
wait, is Spike gay or just british?
turns out this all happens on the moon, and Spike was banished there.
DaringDude: eeyup, same voice actress I think
Both?
welp. i gotta go
...the character design of the dragon looks familiar...
twilight_sprinkle: What do I gang by asskissing a mod?
i for one welcome those new ponies overlord, let's stream them 24/7
TheHoodyNinja: hes a mod, 20 on 1 doesnt matter
Mutterguy: take care man

XAX: Sadly yes
oiBhaM777: black magic has its kinks here take this potion it should have you back to normal in 1 min
Sadly? :l
not that bad
TheHoodyNinja: oh ffs. its nto our fault he was the only one with his views
I heard S3 Premeires September 19th
damn :(
XAX: JUST. WAIT.
*Premieres
JoseEnriquez: Proof?
All the ponies in g1-g3.5 have the same exact personality... with minor adjustments where necessary to plot
Heard it from another brony
...Sibsy?
lol
she so brave
twilight_sprinkle: I know im just trolling you, i still have no idea what the hell was goin on
JoseEnriquez: That actually sounds like a good prediction, no sarcasam
Is Wysteria voiced by Tabitha?
STOCK FOOTAGE!
I suppose
TheHoodyNinja: : | dat poker face
shniper is right
CupcakeWarrior: She might be
OH GOOD LORD
DARLING
it's obvious when the writer remembers "oh yeah, I should make this pony's personality slightly different"
dat voice
GOD STFU RD!
That was Rainbow Dash?
LOL
Yep
Wow
RAinbow dash= rarity???
BAM. RAINBOW DASH.
dat darling..
RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE
i cant hear anything theyre saying over CSS in the background. Total eclipse of the heart is playing from a minigames map D:
that pony next to rainbow dash? THAT'S RARITY
THATS WHAT MOLESTIA SAID
When are they going to do makeovers?
Alright everypony. I need to go now. Bye everypony and bronystate, and remember. "Stay classy my friends.":) (waves goodbye to you)
so i taped a pic of rarity 2 my backpack in school no 1 gave a fuck
dat stanky spike
G'night TheRainbowDash!
RARITY?
It's depressing to hear the VAs like this
bye TheRainbowDash! take care
Night don't let NMM or Molestia bite TheRainbowDash *hugs*
that's RD fused with Rarity... it's pony transmutation in work....
oh noez
i draw ponies in class everyday and no one cares
if not for Faust we would never have discovered their talent
umvc3: WEAR A MLP SHIRT!
Lol Rarity
JoseEnriquez: I actually will now..>:D

OH GOD
valoreins: Wait, hold up...
DudeDaring: epic win
twilight_sprinkle: no.

I fussed around with Rarity?
RAWRity: ok

How do you die in hell, RAWRity?
I'm starting to like Twilight more and more
As a character
TheHoodyNinja: ask mr. garrison.
Ok, I'm out of here. Bye silly filles!:D
I get it now G4 RD and Rarity are sisters
TheHoodyNinja proabbly the same way zombies die twice
TheRainbowDash : yes, that was your former self...
Seperated at birth
" hes a troll"
In a poll eqd is doing, Twilight has more popularity than all the others combined
or at least hidden from each other
JoseEnriquez one problem, Rarity is older than RD
Oh God, a song
RAWRity lawl YOU GO TO HELL AND U DIEEE!!!! dx
/me dances

Hasbro did a meeting with little girls, and they asked them about Vinyl Scratch's red eyes. all of the girls thought that red eyes were scary, so Vinyl officially does not have red eyes. :L

Hasbro didn't want to scare the childrens, and then get a BUNCH of hatemail and "Sueing" crap from all them dumb soccer moms who did the same to derpy
11,02What would you link me to a picture of a spider ;__;
06tip from a DJ: When playing that song on-air, and the song is too quiet (happens alot) just pump up the TOTAL volume, and Decrease the Tremble, and if needed Bass (other Sound leves like Pitch, High sounds, etc. have to be adjusted by ear)
what you want to do is use the "match volume" tab
WHERE IS MY FRIEND CODE
Hasbro needs to stop using G3 Molds for their G4 toys, make proper toys that fit the show, and pick up on the plushie idea.
CupcakeWarrior: you're being terrible today!

<Lighty> tip from a DJ: When playing that song on-air, and the song is too quiet (happens alot) just pump up the TOTAL volume, and Decrease the Tremble, and if needed Bass (other Sound leves like Pitch, High sounds, etc. have to be adjusted by ear) < this is because the "loudness
11,02Alright, stream is back up
you have to put it out of your misery
and its testing my patience
Still pixelated for me o_O
frequencies are the mid frequencies
Or just blurry, that's all
06then Decrease them
06simple right?
sure, it sounds "louder", but the spectral balance will be ruint and might sound worse
my new favorite character is Kinkie Pie
11,02Fixing again
O_o
wur
FlutterShy12: is that a typo or....
*wut
06then test it ou before going live
03<Lighty> tip from a DJ: When playing that song on-air, and the song is too quiet (happens alot) just pump up the TOTAL volume, and Decrease the Tremble, and if needed Bass (other Sound leves like Pitch, High sounds, etc. have to be adjusted by ear) <- well the thing is I don't want to be constantly futzing with the volume
03as it's an older mixing board and somewhat finnicky
LimeV is probably causing all the trouble
06^
03I want to just set and forget
NVM, no blurrying
06then DONT play music
03hence why I want the songs to work *now*
03...LOL
DeathStar: u don wanna know.
Applerape is best poni.
also, loudness perception of frequencies changes with volumes
03It's a music show dude
its causing trouble with me T_T
06being a Good DJ/Music player is CONSTANT working
see the fletcher-munsun loudness curves
03well

03I'm just hosting a radio show involving dance music
back from playing street fighter

06then you have to adjust still~
03it's more like, I'll have a Winamp playlist and announce songs inbetween
03XD
03that's why I want to adjust them all beforehand
i want to do a forced pingout

AM I the only one with a terrible fear of flying? Like... Planes are reallly heavy. And you saw what happened on september 11th 2001... and also I saw online a knife that doesnt get detected by airport sercurity because its in a spacial type of wood... not too settling.
I wanted to do a level up system in the !fight script
Kyu
6 flipper rolls
is there a formula for determining how much damage an attack does?
TheRandomkid321: In science I trust
CupcakeWarrior: yeh true
which remix is this?
10\
And also how much experience is generated?
im not really afraid of anything besides getting intimate with a woman.
07yes
I love hearing the yay as my ping :)
yes?
TheRandomkid321, lern 2 Bernoulli
03how? I wasn't listening

03I don't want to be like "Uh, who is this song by again?" when I'm on the air
03XD
I could do a random move
07other than balancing it more heavily on damage attacks
Still better than hot problems... *shivers* Those voices... they ahunt my dreams...
*haunt*
/me roasts marsh mellow on Midnight_Tempest "you silly filly
ICP is my favorite Rap... dont be messing with the Juggalo...

I could separate attacks into different things

how about
I am all about this!
http://blog.winamp.com/2009/08/24/automatic-volume-leveling-in-winamp-with-replay-gain/
Midnight_Tempest: yes you do :)
and also attacks in separate levels
so if you're level 5
dem complex lyrics
SpringStingray: not everyone can make awesome music... they are my fav, doesnt mean they are perfect
the script selects an attack that can be used by level 5s and below

Hmmm.
I sense a paturn here.
My only problem with this game is that you can't get a game over
not a gameover
you cannot die period
it's like this game is the definition of art
like an interactive painting
thats a bad thing? 6_9
well if you see that way no
but if you want challenge yes it is
/me dances
Not sure If I would enjoy this game, myself.
OMG SO CUTE
Shane377: I'm going to go to bed soon
It's still a good game though
00,10this is um diffrent

you spin me right round Kirby right round
Yes, pony-moon.
it was
Theres a stream?

Oh wow I soo like this game<3

Ya little misspell there

PONIES!

I've been looking for a game with orchestrated music. I'll probably buy this with SSBB when I get a Wii. :)
furnish the crap outta dat room!
That wad of bubblegum on the stream is amusing.
RainBowJack?
That chair
SuperBrony64 Yaa pimp that house out
i cant post Links on the main chat
It's funny how you can fill your room with chairs, infinite chairs
Kirby let that guy barge in
dis house gon' be on CRIBS!
RainBowJack can you re-PM me
I'm not even kidding, I checked, and you can spam your room with chairs
Kirby's Pad?
Spell-of-Gaming: I did that
well....you gotta chair :S
Get out :p
/me Booo~
I shall. I deserve to after that.
:D
Friendly bear
What's going on?
Hnnggg
This is one of the cutest games ever
Oh yeah, R-Type
rage quit time :3
The only reason I cried during the BBBFF song is because I've played Mother 3. :P
R-Type!
dem shmoops
ONE EGG
Bufferr
I never made any association between BBBFF and Mother 3.
ded
So, is SuperBrony64 playing?
Yeah Twi_Fi
00,10prefered Gratius to Rtype
hello
Hello Random_Cow.
hey
Vic Viper all the way
wheres the live stream
00,10mips
Kandarihu, I wouldn't share some, but if I did, I would practically spoil the whole game. :P
00,10refresh oage if you have limeV
hai Random_Cow.
what is this
R-type
i thought this was mlp not air ships
i wanna see some minecraft mlp
It's not all MLP, otherwise we'd go nuts
^
>
I WANT MLP
00,10you must be new here
...
Well I'm sorry son, sometimes we have to suck it up
Now I know you are trying for it.
i am new
Im back... Ya knwo how I said BRB thirsty? yeah. Turn out I went to egt dinner... I love hungry jacks.
I know Mother 3. I beat that game too. But the circumstances are different. I see stronger parallels to One Piece.
Hmmm. Wondering if I should get the song for you...
Ponies randomly come on at different times.
So you never know.
Yeah... That's how it worked out for me.
derp
But I never demanded for ponies oddly enough.
so still sb64?
I just used YouTube or my own list of episodes if I wanted ponies.
Eeyup
I want to help SB out so much right now
i sense a ragequit.
Maybe there should be a disclaimer on the site that ponies may or may not be present at the time of one's visit.
Kaboom
There is, in the FAQ
FAQ is here for a reason.
Well somewhere it says tehy stream thinsg otehr tahn ponies to keep bronys overally entertained.
No one reads the rules and FAQ page. :P
Ninjazz,yes, to not be read.
All true :D
Just like the rules.
I went straight to the FAQ :c
00,10we have rules?!
I just did what ever I was told...
Not last night for me.
/me is afk
o only rea the faq when i was having problems.
00,10I wonder if SB knows he can detach the pod
ima say nah
Twi_Fi, what went on last night?
i dont think ehe knows :3
Rage quit!
rage quit :3
REG QUIT!
I knew it.
No one reads the FAQ and Rules page, like the Terms of Agreement and Privacy Policies :P
^ this
The Itunes Terms and Conditions is hilarious
and Disclaimers
i read the rules and faq because it isnt 80 friggen pages long
Ninjazz, nothing major. Like I mentioned earlier, there were a few trolls spamming. There was also a link posted to a nsfw site, but nopony seemed to notice.
It asks that you not use Itunes in Nuclear Development
LOL
Ahhh, one of those days it seems.
lol
I kinda like those links to other website too. Its a nice WTF feeling.
00,10I keep trying to get Shizu to put in a thing that makes you read the faq and rules before leting you in
00,10it would also have a quiz
A quiz? lol
Make it a test :|
You mean, like a Agree and Disagree button?
00,10yep
ooh ooh a pony test :P
A quiz made in flash would be best. Especially with ponies guiding you through the quiz.
00,10and after you hit agree it brings up a quiz and you cant go back to look at the rules
Like who is best pony? Every answer would be Luna.
a test... yeah... that would work
Ooh, nice :P
Oh. Asking that the software not be used for anything "mission critical"? I saw that in other programs too.
But if they make a hacking tool for it, the hackers will still answer the questions :P
Sneaky
If they make a hacking tool instead of just answering manually then they're rather dumb lol ;)
Ehh. Hackers know what they are doing. We wont to get rid of the useless people.
It's just to make sure that you don't trust the software to never crash.
00,10inb4 sorry cant stream new pony ep i failed the quiz and locked my self out of the site for the next 6 hours
Hmmmm. That would suck...
hahahahahaha
Another popular thing I see on here is when somepony comes on and asks, "When is the new episode?" almost immediately after the episode was played.
wai i suck at quizs
Hmph
Time zones, Twi_Fi.
Yeah, I guess.
When is the new episode?
00,10that's what we have tom for
how do they work
Just something we can't help. :S
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
I like how Tom says that.
Why does everyone keep !cding for? :P
im helping :)
is TOM a bot?nHe seems to say thre same stuf over agin.
Yeah, he's a bot
>_(\
:|
I was pretty sure
Tom should say, "No more new episodes. You'r bucked!"
Which is kinda obvious
...TOO obvious.
DUN DUN DUN
Well, there WILL be more episodes. We just don't know when.
inb4 Season 3 is cancelled.
00,10oh that reminds me. we have a new konami code trick on the theader pages.
:o
why would you post that :(
o.o
cuz i evil.
hmm?
do you know how cold it is too drink an ice cold drink in a room with air conditioner blasting and a fan on full force? Im bucking shivering
If we find out the date and time slot of S3's premier 2 months in advance, Tom will be updated with that information, and it will respond accordingly.
00,10Hit "up up down down left right left right b a backspace"
WHat does taht do?
On the Hub's Facebook page, there's a poll on picking where the couple (we know who) will honeymoon, Manehattan is at the top
00,10try it and find out
Hi everypony

I blame Spell-of-Gaming.

Hi
Ninjazz2: Thank you.
Far out, my albums screwed up again.
Thou art welcome, XAX.
Ive got a philosophical question; if time==money, and money==the root of all evil, is time in part evil?
Hey Sky

Still, Money isn't the root of all evil, WHO ARE THE ONE that THINKS Money is evil?

TheRandomkid321, I'd stop following new episodes religiously if the show became crappy. I don't think it would be a good move to introduce huamns, but if it was handled well, it wouldn't be that big a deal.

The movie. The one with big ass Rei?
The original anime was made while Hideaki Anno was dealing with serious depression. It went downhill when he was recieving therapy. These movies were made a long time after that. He's better now. So I hear it's nicer.
Giaaaaa

They have made many movies from this series.
00,10no not death and rebirth
00,10Rebuild. it's valled rebuild of eva 1.01

Vordox, actually if you watch the series you discover there is nothing random about it.
Am I the only person who thinks that they're largely all suffering from PTSD?
Why the hell are you on at this hour
I watched 3 of the old one... I really made a hatred for it back then due to how it was made. ><
I mean, the world nearly ended.
Randomnerd, I think that is the point
Well, this kid certainly has a lot of issues. :P
00,10shiji so anti hero even his VA hates him
RainbowAsh: Okay, good, I'm not crazy.
They are getting pressed into constant life and death situations.
Keep in mind that this is supposed to be a deconstruction of the mecha anime at the time.
dat piano
It's not really that shinji is a whiny bitch, or Ikari is a heinous dick.
Not surprised Sumica. :P
Ohai Rei
"This Day Aria" gets better and better every time i see it
Shinji is a whiny little brat though.
Boom ded.
Shinji is worse "hero"
Holy shit...
There is probably an upper limit on awesome
the hell happened?
00,10what happend to the doctors?
but that song has break limit
But I like the anime anyway.
Shinji just wants to meat his father. Gendo just wants someone he knows who can pilot an Eva to kill that angel.

you know, i think hasbro is starting to realise the same thing i think valve has. quality > quantity
So, brbs, restarting mIRC up
The LCL is the stuff that everyone got turned into at the end of the series, right? What everyone else refers to as Tang?
I hope not
00,10yeah
Or season 3 will never come out
Ninjazz2: Perhaps the reason people hate Shinji is because they imagine they'd be any different in that situation.
And minus the c and plus an s, Sumica? :P
This robot reminds me of EVA... even though I've never really watched either the TV show or the movies
Well... I don't hate him. He's just a freakin
00,10it is eva
But it will be SO good when it does
-kid throw him a damn bone.
Kay
what i meen is mlp:fim is probably expencive, but the return is greater than if they had split that cost among more cheeper shows
Randomnerd, well, most people don't watch fiction to watch people just as helpless as themselves
... oh ok *facepalm*
dats a big elevator
I like how NERV is supposed to be a SECRET agency, and they've got their logo everywhere.
I don't expect Shinji to be an epic badass, I just expect less whining.
/me watched all of Evangelion on Adult Swim except for the last episode. He had to cut his TV down to the base channels 2-13 for financial reasons at that time.
00,10woops forgot to teach him how to drive it
Phase4 they are also apparently starting to see increase in viewership on their other shows as well
I could honestly say that if i was him, i'd be fucking excited to pilot a god damned EVA and fighting huge monsters.
trips
RainbowAsh: Then they should just freaking remake Fist of the North Star
I was just making a cheap "Valve can't count to 3" joke. I agree with the quality > quantity philosophy.
Sumica: THANK YOU! It's SO obvious but they JUST ignored it. URGH MY BRAIN hurts... I know good writing, and this isn't. XD
oh lol, that went right over my head
Whay, someone gets it
Derp robot.
You know
you're doing it wrong
trilogies are laaam
laame*
I think I'm gonna go
Snuffsis: that was the attitude of the main characters of virtually every single mecha series leading up to this series. That was something that Hideaki Anno wanted to deconstruct.
00,10ker snap
ouch
G'night everyone. Cya tomorrow.
Ow....
/me faints
00,10game over yeahhhhhhhhhhhh
That kid sucks.
Really really bad.
Well, good job Shinji.
Died
worst pilot ever
boomheadshot
Oh yeah... He has so much experience in this sorta stuff.
Kandarihu And he pretty much failed at making a likable character while trying to make it seem "real" yay for him. :P
I could do better than that!
In more than a few series, the pilots have some kind of training.
inb4 epicness
Guess you can't stick a kid into a giant robot and expect wonders.
And then we all died due to relying on a person who had no % of actually piloting it... OH HAI PLOT
00,10enter the zerker
Vordox: There is a really awesome explanation for all of it
It's gone berserk.
...OKay, cool roar. :P
Even better!
That roar would sound more impressive if it didn't sound daft. :P
Why are the damages of the robot directly hitting the kid's nerve system?
Derpy
Vordox, thought there is a reason he was chosen, it is still amusing that they sent him in with no training.
Berserk EVA is crazy
Yeah, but...It started as a Deus ex Machina, RainbowAsh.
I think the robot took over instead of Shiji.
00,10cause they pilot with there mind
AT-AT field.
Ew.
magic
Phlebetonium
There
;lD
00,10AT= anti terror

00,10or was it absolute terror
Absolute Terror
