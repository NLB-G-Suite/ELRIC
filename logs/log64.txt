/me tosses a pebble into streamception
after the rainboom
I love Dashes voice as a filly

Ugly to me
:O
I just want to kick her in the chin
noooo!!!!
hmmm I wonder if I can bend time and space to create the MLP universe.
is filly a term exclusive to young ponies?
Filly is young female
or is it just females
Mare is adult female
it changes depending on the episode
hey dari...
but the mayor say "fillies and gentlecolts"
Hm
guess my first name.
True
:p
Whos willing to fund me to make a portal to the MLP universe?
Rumplestiltzkin
wouldn't that imply it's synonymous with ladies
while in sonic rainboom rainbow says "I was just a filly" meaning a kid
don't wimp out on me
:p
very carefully
maybe shes actually refrencing pre sex change
:p
O_o
I bet it starts with Q
hmmm...

Target Canterlot Toy Guide!
Do you want Luna, but don't feel like waiting until August 1st for the release? Apparently the fine workers over at Target are more than happy to completely ignore the street date, assuming you give them the item code to look the stuff up with.
Have some copypaste from the ponychan thread. These codes are meant for the pad things the employees carry around, so make sure to find one that looks important enough for a "hand code thingy"!

Scottish is British, lawl. :P
7hehe
Firefly: awesome! I was born and raised in scotland, by and indian mother and a scottish father
and i'm currently in germany
7English i think he means
but then firefly said their mother was indian
which... is odd
7no born in not indian
7she is german and scottish
D: what is 'true Brit' when britain a) was founded by many foreigners b) is now 90% foreigners xP
7and born in india

7I want blind bag poy
Though they're going to the US some time.
i want blind bag ponies
Everyone wants blind bag ponies.
7yes
7They sound fun
McCloud: If you can get Fluttershy or Rainbow Dash blind bag ponies you can make a load of money on them too.
7Everything is so pastel
i'm17yearsoldandwhatisthis
Someone told me the blind bags cost $2.
WUT
SDFGHOPAEJAGHGROPKAER
BURN IT
KILL IT WITH FIRE
everything is so sexist and offensively 'girly'
7Yes
Hahahahaha
7Its quite cute
>actually stops video :P
7HEHE
So they cost $2 apparently.
uploads of screencaps almost done
7Fluffy pink ponies
And I saw a Fluttershy on eBay sell for $35.
7with ribbions and cuteness
oh
7Do they sell a firefly? i think not
you can paint ontopof one ; )
For Twilight it was a total of about £4 including p+p
7I suppose
7Its not the same
p+p was the most expensive part.
The actual bid was only $1.50
7hmmm i shall look into this
i looked on amazon but 12 quid to get em when amazon.com they're $5? NO
Dman: What are you talking about?
the brushables now
sorry should have said
Ahh.
Apparently brushables are sold in the UK now.
did you guys see? Sony trolled EU by pricing the PlayStationVita at 250 $ and 250 Euro. 250 euro is $364
then looked on toysruswebsite and amazon and no find
LOL
Wow.
guess they're staaaarting to be sold
I suppose it's only in a couple of stores at the moment.
It'll spread quickly I reckon.
Yea i hope so
MUST try my hand at hairstylin'
I bought an RD brushable anyway.
Off eBay.
: D you have already?!
=D
7ok everyone have fun but i got to go
Ok.

http://www.mediafire.com/?tg69mhqxh6mc27r download and view =]
pics of screencaps from y/day's marathon
I semi read half the comments bjornfot had
i wanna know exactly what he said about me : 0
lolwut
I was just inferring from your implications...:2,15
What comments?
i said
. . . dayum. I gotta reread it now D:
at some point...later...
The comment I was inferring from was this one:
[12:15] <Dman> at some point...later...
:P
how quaint
YES
STREAMING BILL HAS BEEN AXED
fuck yeah
Lol, I wanted to see them try and enforce it.
Because that would have failed so badly.
Now you just have to legalize torrents and you'll almost be as good as glorious Sweden!
yea, but the few they might have made an example of would have been like :(
Woo
Outnumbered.
OUTNUMBERED
I love this show.
it's time!
prince, is it just me, or can you always think of a million things the parents could say? don't you just wanna reach and slap them?
I was kind of surprised to find out that the kids make up most of their lines.
@too_quietmeter The stream
6 The stream is 31% too_quiet. (858)
They just have a vague guideline, then make up their lines themselves.
dari, fix your volume. nao
It's not possible.
eeyup
Unless I get a new sound card or something.
*amplifier*
Yeah, the amplifier would be a function of the sound card.
LOOOOUDEEEER
Mine doesn't have it.
So I'd need to get a new sound card.
uh, no
eh, it's fine. i could still hear 'PLAYGUUUUU' :P
Uh, yes. :P
you can intercept and manipulate the output sound with a virtual amplifier
MFW I checked and was told that's impossible.
it is?
I dunno, I was told you can't do it with software.
Not if the output goes to your speakers or so
In the UK?
Ages ago.
started? : 0
4th of July
but you can do it with the sound that goes to the streaming tool
Then every day from then on other than weekends.
have you seen any? I mean, are they identical the the ones I will already have?
Hmm, I think my 2TB hard drive just turned up at the door.
!
The streaming tool intercepts, copies and broadcasts the output sound. You could have a program that intercepts the virtual sound before it reaches the streaming tool, manipulates it, and forwards it to the streaming tool, which will think it's the real sound.
Well if you still think it's possible, go find a program that does that. :P
is there any difference with the UK and US show?
It's probably not easy, but it should work in theory.
FUCK
MY EARS
>have headset on
Dman: Nope.
ok
i'll focus all mah efforts in finding the spanish dub now
>set colume to max since the stream is derp
>hear it just about

>extract rar
Lol.
>forget I have the nyancat prograss bar plugin
>NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN right into my fucking ears at full volume
Lol, ears.
BLOWN.
i had that for like a day
so you have a 2TB?
Nah, turns out it was something else.
...why would one need 2TB?
To put stuff on maybe?
what stuff
porn?
aww what was it?
100s of films/games/programs/etc.
films? pfft
i have a 1TB and it's about 80% filled and im still getting more stuff constantly
Handheld GPS.
such as 1080p MOVIAS 10GIGAS
per movie
Not mine, my dad must have ordered it.
But I do like my tech, yes. :P
Bjornfot: A single PS3 game tends to be about 30 GB.
=]
also that
10 of them = 300 GB.
games
i have 200GB of wii vidya on my WBFS partition
sometimes they can be like 5GB but the file has 20GB of nothing
If you think no one would ever need 2TB Bjornfot, you massively underestimate my ability collect a hell of a lot of stuff.
I may need a 2TB but i have a 1TB so not sure if buy 1 or 2tb for 2nd harddrive
>watching 'meet Rarity' on hasbro.com/es_es aka Spain.
>hear 'Rarity dreams of designing the princess a beautiful dress oneday.
Da foque?
i can forgive the 'celestia only alicorn' bit i guess
Is alicorn a fan term?
yea but i meant
the vid said 'only one with a magical horn AND wings'
I thought it was McCloud?
that's ifne cuz ep1 luna on moon
/me has a 20TB RAID 6 array
It's not mentioned in any MLP episode.
but i can't believe I heard that about rarity
still watching the other 'meet the's
oh god in the english one it said pinkie loved visiting sugarcube corner D: doesn't she live there?
aaaadn yup same in spanish 'loves visiting for sweets'
!pokemon
Dragoran, you are a 6Meowth.
Lol fail.
oh, hasbro
yay AJ for best meetthe video
Ok, I think THIS package is my hard drive.
: D
/me wiped a bead of sweat off his brow. his hands were shaking. It was Time. He brought the radio up to his ear, the receiver next to his mouth, and he said only
/me 'The package is ready.'
!
Lawl.
A 2TB drive only holds 240 hours of HD video.
So says the box. you listen to that sh*t?
DURRR 'HD video'
define 'HD video,' oh bauwx
I'd assume 1080p :P
Well even then eyedunno
Ashes to Ashes?
Nice.
depends on quality of this 1080p video, and compression within the files, and so much more even I don't know about >_<
the 1080p pony hdtv rips are 745-746 MiB each
hmm
Yup same, yea they are
and are 22 minutes +- one second
and they're mkv rite?
eeyup
x264
if they were avi they'd be like 1GB and if they were eyedunno mp4 they'd probably be like 1.2GB
!
>mp4 larger than avi
Pony HD doesn't really count as HD.
:P
i don't think so tim
Since you can't really get HD vectors.
720p colourcorrected are like 720MB
preetee big
yeah, it's kinda derp how the 720ps are almost as big as 1080
ack i meant avimp4 other way bjornfot just reread it >_<
LOL
FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF MUSIC
doesn't the 720ps use the same codecs, though?
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
OH YEAH
LOL
welp i have 1080p, 720p colourcorrected all nice and pretty, 720p again in mp4 so as to be able to edit them
and 240p for mah iPod classic
=]
bjornfot idunno
at least the non-color corrected ones
but I find the ones i have for 720p are KAWAIIIII~~~~~desu on my 1080p LED telly
i prefer the 720p to 1080p even for watching on big resolution displays
really now
the only advantage with 1080p is no marks
*720
well, lemme screencap a comparison in COLOUR ofc, not resolution quality, just t oshow what I mean =]
:O yea 720p are unmarked not 1080 >_<
I can't wait for the Blu-ray set to come out so we can have unmarked 1080...
inb4 they only release 720p DVDs
bjornfot how about I slap their sh*t!
http://i.imgur.com/o5sb3.png
ok the comparison i made in a jiffy here sucks a little : /
and you can't compare resolution
but on the right is 720p with mediaplayerclassic so as to use the gamma/colour files with the vid
theres a teenie tiny difference in that the right looks a tiny bit more colourful - in motion the difference is a little bigger
on an LED TV it made me smile when I compared the two - it's noticable :P
wait WAT
?
youtube has REACTIONS?
Reactions?
where did you get those 720ps, Dman?
Ponychan
look at comments !
bjornfot
um
all from mediafire or somewhere one by one by using a program that was suggested on ponychan somewhere
Still don't see what you mean Dman.
with the link?
or reaction
Reaction
to the right of the comment box
is a 'reaction' dropdown on youtube now 0_o
I don't see it.
:P
'funny / incredible / classic / cute / what? / ouch'
Ah, it's from the sticky on /pony/?

sony's was respectable, very nice tech, ninty's was innovative - competelely new stuff that may or may not win
Nintendo owned E3 again.
Sony should have been bottled.
only E3 EVER that is worse is sony's 2006...wanna see ? :P
It's kind of funny how Nintendo, who started the wholoe wagglefest, are now the ones who are saving the gaming industry.

Eugh, butterfly.
Worst stroke. :P
shutterfly
it was very very painful : /
lol
my least fave stroke yea
most people prefer freestyle aka front crawl
So did you decide to stop yourself, or did your parents tell you to or something?
i think i prefered it too. but i was best at breaststroke, IMO because others just were'nt good at it. it's what I got 5th in at 13 y/o in england. a comp that happened just near Wales =]
That's really a shame. :2,15(
Why do people work out and stuff, anyway?
It was nice, but i wanted to try out different stuff. i did foot ball and badminton for about 2 years till recently and now i don't do anything and go on runs for the mo till i find something
u know like on sat i left for a little bit for the run ;D
Haha, I've always hated running, though I went for a short run yesterday.
Legs still haven't recovered yet today.
XD
/me brohoofs Dman
:I
silly brits
Pff. :P
Silly Bjornfot.
Doesn't like water.
the best part is actually coming home and not realising you've ran, not realising you're getting fitter or whatever, but realising you're not part of society's little game of impression, that you can go on a run in broad daylight passing walkers and don't giveafuck
that's the best feeling :3
I never lift my butt from the computer chair and I'm 190cm & 55kg.
but ofcourse on saturday at 2am noones up xP
Bjornfot you could start with something small and work your way to more strenuous work! you can do it, it just takes mootivation
that's the only thing that ever stopped anyone
motivation : /
how about no
Motivation is easy when it's something you enjoy.
heck, if you're happy with how you are do what you want cuz a pirate is free = ]
i DON'T enjoy physical excercise.
I have a neat quote from one of my childhood friends:
i kinda enjoy it but sometimes i really don't want to do it
"Any physical activity that doesn't lead to orgasm is unnecessary."
What if it's fun?
>physical activity
>fun
then you jump in the shower while your sweat breaks up
=D
silly brits.
hahaha bjornfot nice quote
>is 100% spanish confirmed for at least 5 generations
OH GOD pressups
Exercise release endorphins.
just moved to england after a divorce
pain
HAPPY CHEMIKUL
They are like natures FUN HAPPY DRUGZ.
: D
nature's*
That's why Bjornfot. :P
It makes you feel good.
i tried to do some push ups ones
*once
didn't end well
it won't
do it again
and again
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_zcZR777A&list=UUDkiZsWYvEHw
to be honest i've never felt any sort of rush from endorphins but when i DON'T do exercise i can get a little depressed. overdose i guess : P
is this you bjornfot?
yes.
or something similar that happened to you?
oh it is :3
ok i'm watching it
Some furry on MSN dared me to.
hahaha
you're shaking and your arms look not too muscley, so it just takes time of doing this everyday
I see a box in the background.
the worst part for me at least like is is the awkward/shyness about it. i don't want anyone seeing me do it >_<
with a ps2/3 controller on
my dad walked in on me in this vid.
and a gee-tar
tell him you're doing exercise. like a ba-WHY

year 0 to 6 (first 7) is 'primary school'
lol, 0?
year 7 to 11 is 'secondary school'
I didn't have a year 0. :P
yea year 0 or 'reception' :P
prince-u didn't miss much
Hah.
once uve done year 11 (at 16) you can leave
you can job
Sweden has grade=years
You can job.
Lol.
you can college wihch HUGELY lowers potential jobs and in england college is for the ones withou....well the failures xP
dont' wanna be mean but that's how it sorta is
Grade 1-9, primary school
#OR after year 11
Wait, what's wrong with college?
you can do '6th form'
Nope?
6th form tends to be a far better option for uni
My sister went to a college, and she's very intellegent.
Grade 10-12 (or ring 1-3), speicalised "Gymnasium" secondary school
Yes some can
sorry i should explain it
um
there's less options for college BUT certain options are insanely hard and u can do thru college
Hmm, there's a wider range of choice at the colleges near me.
/me is listening to bjornfot sing the cutie mark crusaders.
I have very limited choice at the sixth form in my school.
OH OF course! it would depend where you go : /
Compared to most other places.
oh gawd i have a new creepy fan D:
there's 2 colleges near ME, and that's
Around where I live any way.
bournemouth college and pool college' both have sodall to offer here : /
for me colleges here don't offer much
but there's like 4 good secondary schools. one is mainly art school, one is mainly Tech, one is mixed of all
and the one i go to is languages
woo sathi
i stayed in the 'languages' one but i did sciences aniways cuz i can
Ohai Sathi.
Hey Sathi =]
hello people
we were just discussing our educashun
7oh interesting
bjornfot- maybe
Couldn't you still get back into swimming Dman?
Or does missing a couple of years really make a huge difference?
i liked both but preferred one
Ah, ok.
7th Element of Harmony: The Element of Surprise
once you train even forr just half a year! you can't get any faster
it's ALL about the technique
and stuff
WOO FRANKIE BOYLE!
how you take your turns, when you breathe, conserving energy and oxygen with only necessary movement ect
BOYLE!
bjornfot you singing WWU is mesmerising for some reason
y
i don't know perhaps cuz i'm sleep deprived? but it sounds sooo preeeteee

Oh, yeah I forgot.

...what do you plan to do with them, Bjornfot
How come all the bronies I talk to are awesome?

Hi everybrony!
hey destructor236 again! ^_^
Yo,Dman!
=]
did you guys see? Sony trolled EU by pricing the PlayStationVita at 250 $ and 250 Euro. 250 euro is $364 <- I think corporations ignore exchange rates on purpose, hoping people are dumb enough to do the same.
Well, game manufacturers/pubishers.
Damn that's expensive!
*publishers.
7yea steam does that too..
7 1 dollar = 1 euro
= one british pound.
= Australian dollar (maybe)
Nittany_tiger isn't that what I said word for word? did you copy it ? :3
Activision does it with CoD
7blizzard does it too
I did. I didn't want to highlight you, so I didn't copy your name.
: D I feel happee ^_^
Yes, what the hell sony?
Activision and Blizzard are both headed by Kotick, a person that makes Eugene Krabs look generous.
Is it Black Ops you're talkin' about when you said CoD?
Yeah.
Also MW2.
Call of duty elite
Call of Duty: Milk the Fanbase Even More.
>pay for console. >if 360 pay for xbox live too if psn option to play for psn+ >pay for game >NOW pay for game's exclusive multiplayer?
That's should be the true name for it.
Black Ops wins in my book because it has Machete,Freddy and Buffy.
nittany_tiger the title of the next game :P
7Do not like Kotick.jpg
Yes i know i did my homework
:P
It'll go pay to play eventually, though.
know what else is being milked? Assassin's creed =[ AC1 was amazing
know what isn't? ZELDA! why wub zewda. cannot wait for skyward sword

Errybody has to have opinions! That's fine by me :P
It's my favourite vidya franchise by the way, just to let ya know
Well,i did like the first Zelda game and Spirit Tracks.
I loved spirit tracks - the music with headphones for a DS game was incredible, especially the overworld theme

why wub this qwote: Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.
of course, only works in English, but still
yeah.
I have a good one
shoot
"Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence.
And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so.
I love that one! CS lewis for the win
Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up." -C.S. Lewis

Ok, and that's fine
03VMWare
03;P
What can you run on OSX
that you can't run on Windows
03no that's what I mean
:o
Thrashers fan?
06HML
the iPod touch is kinda blah, I have to admit
06absolutly nothing
as a pure MP3 player
0The thrashers moved to winnipeg.
Wait, blah
Logic & Final Cut
03If I want to use GarageBand (why would I WANT to?)
0Yes.
03I could run OSX using VMWare
& GB
03and do it in a window
03:P
03I even have sound working
I've been following the news.
03which is... kinda hard to do
03;P
the newer Nanos are blah as well
the iLife suite, but nm else is worth it
03my sister actually LIKES the new Nanos
Oh, I meant- What Windows software can't run on a mac xD
I liked my 4th gen Nano, that was fine
Habs fan myself. Sucks for the fans in Atlanta.
EW
yuck :\
03I know right
The Nanos were...decent
All I can say
03as for the iPads... there are definitely better tablets out there
The 1st one SUCKED
03Motorola Xoom anyone?
0we still have the Hawks though
03cheaper, does 4G,e tc etc
That should NOT have been the replacement for the Nano
and blah
Lapblet anyone?
06i like the idea of the NEW Cloudsystem they release with iOS 5
I don't like the Xoom
03EW THE CLOUD

CLouds suck
03a concept that they had since the 1870s
03er
I like GROUND
031970s
:3
I used one and I didn't see it as that impressive
03that is now being re-invented
03it's dumb
0Their alt logo is better.
06i said
06NEW cloud
Was it created by Kevin Flynn?
Don't you have a baseball team too?

0Oldest team in the MLB.

03how is a hard drive not more convenient

Just access from anywher
06DROPBOX!
03No sitting and waiting for something to load
it has happened before.
How is it conveient to not have local storae
03I do dropbox from my Android...
because you can't plug it into your iPad/Pod/Phone
06DROPBOX WITH ONLY 1GB INSTEAD OF MY FREE 2GB!!
03^
Blah
Hey Dusky
I can store over 300GB of stuff
03I dunno, I don't see any redeeming quality to the iPad

03speaking of which I need to install my HTTP server again but I'll do it later
0My favorite is the text logo.
03Pattyrick
06i use it for pictures, handy if you're everywhere
03with Android, all your information is stored on Google
Yes?
03so it's built in
03:P
The text logo? Ewww.
INB4 Google is evil
03pictures, well, how many fricking cameras do you need?
One billion
Well then why are you hating on cloud? :P
Including your 10 phones
30 MP3 players
03because, my phone does not use the cloud
0The airplane (or aeroplane) one is the worst IMO
0not the left onwe
03the only thing that's stored on Google is account information
03contacts, settings, etc
03your actual data is stored locally
0the hockey stick one
I do wish they hadn't used the F-18 on the logo.
if they hack into your account, they could steal that
06brb~
03yes but this is Google we're talking about
and it's a different concept, not the same kind of thing
07Rar!
03Zip!
07Hi. :>
03I don't think people are going to hack Google anytime soon :P
they could
Who knows
0this rules though
0http://www.sgclark.com/blog/assets/TRODAT_JETS.jpg
Did you think they'd hack PSN?
They already hacked Apple?
Sorta
03lots of people thought they'd hack PSN
Who likes the PS3?
:P
03because Sony is a pathetic pile of crap
No. The official one is better.
03so they deserved it
03:)
I never heard of it before
0yeah
I'm sure that a big company like Google has great security, but that doesn't mean people aren't trying
Also, yes the top right logo is good. I think it's meant to be a shoulder patch though.
inb4 no, I'm not trying xD

03APple hasn't made anything actually revolutionary since the mid 80s
EW profit maximisation
03had I been alive back then, I would have been a fan
03but now, nope

whatever you say about not revolutionary, drf :P
Hey Patty, is the iPad revolutionary?
03Pattyrick really needs to watch Pirates of Silicon Valley
Yeah
Nice movie
iPod was probably one of the first brands of mass-produced MP3 players on the market
03nope
03it wasn't
I think it is
What about the Sony walkman?
Montreal needs to go back to this song. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfTpGKJqROY
06back
03it was just the first to ADVERTISE
03There were plenty of them
03I had mp3 players long before iPods came out
Hey guys!
WB
03and they used SD cards
it helped restart the tablet boom; I'd never seen anything like it
Hey Bane.
0this is good
but I never saw people with MP3 players before iPods
It's so much better than the U2 song that replaced it.
03you obviously didn't see ME then
after iPods came, it seemed like a lot of people got MP3 players
0it is, it's original too.
not even iPods, MP3 players just became more popular
07You and your zune drf lol
03I'm not even talking about my Zune
LOL Zune
03I used to have one of those Rio players
0i went to a thrashers game
Rio Angry Birds?
*shot*
good game
I liek
03that's basically an SD card slot with buttons
0wanna see the one i went to?
Sure.
and I got it for free
03so did I
0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bygqQLuUPWc
Same here
03http://www.digitalnetworksna.com/shop/_templates/item_main_Rio.asp?model=257
03that's wha tI used to have
I've only managed to get to one game before. It was a home game in Montreal against Tampa. They lost 4-2 sadly.
0you can't see me on it
0RRRRGH
0They lost?
0aw man
Yeah
loadsa people and we're still missing two hours
"Designed for gym rats, runners, mountain bikers, snowboarders & anyone who is playing hard & wants music to motivate them to play even harder."
DRF is a Gym Rat
03nah, but that mp3 player was awesome
03>FM radio
0They came back from 4-1 at the one i went to
...fm..radio
03I've had one in my mp3 player for years before Apple ever thought of it
03:P
Nice!
On a MP3 player
:P
0Thrash gave me a high five :)
03>The ability to record FM radio as mp3 files
Apple too AGEDS
9Guess I'll stream some Killing Floor before the main event
So did my old Sansa MP3 player
xD
Awesome.
0and he gave my dad a high five
*in Applejack voice*Y'all postin' 'bout hockey?
03the one thing that Zune doesn't do is record the radio
Or whatever it was
03it only plays it
03dude
03Sansa
03is amazing
0eeyup
I know
03I have like four of them now
Ah reckon we are.
I have two of them
XD
03as long asy ou don't need a hard drive, go get a Sansa
I sadly lost/broke my old model :
03I mean
:<
03pay $50 for an 8GB Sansa
03or pay $200 for an 8GB iPod Nano
As it wouldn't connect to my PC
03WHICH MAKES MORE SENSE?
Hrm
...Does it come in Silver?
03LOL
03some of them do
Killing Floor?Wuzzat?
Sansaderp
XFD
But yeah
03exactly
0? i don't know
03that's mainly what I hate about Apple is the whole brainwashing thing
03making people think their products are actually worth buuying
03when in reality they're overpriced garbage
It's a game.
Maybe DRF can brainwash the truth into us
/me claps
Ah reckon it is.
ooo dcd
03LOL
/me watches a light turn on
/me replaces it with a CFL
Or LED lightbulb
Either one is better
0so no more YT links?
I've been doing crappy at Killing Floor lately.
9well YT links are pretty much for real preshows
9this is more of "I'm playing Killing Floor atm, guess I could stream it as well"
But the best part about my iPod Nanos is that they never seem to want to connect to my computers
03LOL
03dude
The cables just (don't) work
03you know something I saw for sale that made me go WTF
03it was like a $200 machine
Yeah?
03"Insert CDs and rip them straight to your iPod, no computer required!"
03I was like ...wtf?
0So I can post links?
200$ for that
Either people are lazy
Or People are stupiud
*stupid
9yeah. Won't stream em though
03>People who buy iPods
03>Stupid
03Yeah
03that makes sense

What is that?
What kind of dice?
03it's a videeo basically saying how Pokémon sucks now
Interweb dice.
03which is entirely true
03:)
Are we talking standard D6's, maybe some spiky bastard D4's or maybe a weighty pair of D20's?
bbl
I found my CD of Wicked lol
Bai
03but fine cya
D-whatnow?

D20 is for real men.

07I'm really glad to be back
I am sorry.It's just i never play RPGs.Except Final Fantasy when i'm really bored.
07Not because I didn't like Arti or anything, but in light of recent events in Norway
Ah
07I'd rather be here than elsewhere.
03like what o.o
07... You ... Ha. The bombing and shooting?
03I actually didn't hear about that

O.o
03something I did hear though
03was that Norway was like the leading country for alternative fuel

Pyro's a selectable character in the game.
Or is DCD talking in the stream (I'm not watching).

Is that a Combine?
I mean one of the players.
LEEEEEEEEEET'S DO IT!

I might get on there any play in a half hour if that server you're on isn't full.
Same here.
Unlucky me,i don't have either Killing Floor OR Steam.
You're missing out. Get Steam—Team Fortress 2 just went free recently.
My CPU was lagging becasue i downloaded Steam a couple of weeks ago.

Not sure. I can't read it. :/

Roger roger.
That's way worse.
That's a million times worse.

Wanted to see how many people would notice :P
03well I see fakefacts in the URL
Can it be LODS O EMONE time now?
Random shit indeed.
When you threw that cash,it looked like in Minecraft.
Yeah, didn't help any
the dosh is now DIAMONDS
Minecraft is adding slenderman as new mob in 1.8
I mean the way you threw that cash.
You're in my way sir.

I wonder if there's a ponyville map in this.
Destructor236: Maybe when kof_ponyville is finished, someone will try to convert the map to KF.
If there's a Doom map,then why not a Ponyville map?
That was AWESOME!
Yes
Amazing.
Yes.There are some blurry pixels when alot of stuff whas going on,but other than that,perfect.
Garbageday made it clear that it was a trap

That X-Men cartoon is one of my favorite shows.All being cartoons,of course.
Likewise.
I don't really like live-action that much.
Unless it's internet reviews.
Man, the voice acting in this game is really funny.
Here comes 2!
I think the voice acting in this is annoying as fuck.
It's called the Mute button.
It's just i love making fun of it.
I can see why it'd be annoying, it's the same reason I find it funny, I think.

Power useage
Awww shit...
03the Wii has a power brick, not just a plug
Think about it :P
03usually, that brick can use different voltages
02Bermuda uses 220V 60h or 110V 50h?
US
We run on US xd
03hm
03though
03can the Wii's power brick do both 120 and 240V?
03It might be able to
02Nope
03you sure about that?
I dobut it without modding
03well
02because the Electricity frecuency screws up
03you know that box?
03that's part of the plug?
03What do you think that does, magic?
03It converts AC into DC, which is what the console runs on
03the box generally can take different voltages
/me points at the Electrity frecuency change 50h to 60h
03o.o
03other way around
US is 60
03yeah
03and techncailly it's 59.94, not 60
/me hides
03but never mind me, I'm just a nerd
Europeanjs are slow anyway *shot*
I know
:|
03well that's where PAL and NTSC come from
Just like how it isn'
02lol.
t
0325 frames per second @ TV in Europe
0350Hz / 2
03magic
Exactly 30FPS, it's 29.94
:P
03and ~29.97fps is ~59.94/2
Or however it can go
Blaa
Ohwell
03and then you get film which uses 23.976fps and screws both up :D
03hence the progressive vs interlaced
Now, time for 3DS proxy issues :D
02loool
031080p is usually 24fps
Big Daddy got pwned.
03usually.
Lol, it's always interesting what's streaming when I get here. Are you actually playing?
03yeah um
03Ray

03looking at that
DCD is.
03Input: 110-240V AC, Output: 12V DC, 3.7A
03like I said
03it should work
03;P
5 seconds!
Ohai RDash.
Hi
So we just need to saw off the plug and replace the end with a europe standard?
You got a break from clearing the sky?
03LOL sawing off
03nah, just use an adapter
/me again points at the Electricity Frecuency
03heck if you're going to be there long term
03I could MAIL you an adapter
03Ray
It converts anyway
03No country in the world uses 240V and 60Hz
Hurp
Nope, it's been so hot that I had to make it rain over here.
03^
03Trust me, it will work
Oh.
02Mine wii is 60hz .-.
what are we watching?
03again, that little box attached to the cord is a transformers
03...
03no
blah
Thank you for your uber-reliable service, Italia Telecom
03Ray
killing floor right now
03The Wii runs off direct current, right?
ah
My US wii worked on the UK/PAL TCs
03Hz only exists for alternating current
*TVs
xD
Ooh
Nice
03the transformer turns it INTO DC
/me derp
Ohai Silvermane
03yay actually taking an interest in physics in high school?
Well,it's pretty breasy where i am RDash.
Yup
02.-.
:P
03I'm also a pro at cellphones, if you need anything
/me hides
*breazy
03heck
03I had this physics class
hello master havetubawilltravel
03and my teacher actually asked me to give a talk about cellphone frequencies since I knew more than he did
03I was like :D
whenever you get that worked out, ray
Y u geeky?
03because I can be?
DragonRage wishes it would rain here. And not just because I love rain—this heat is unbearable.
I'll be able to play brawl again when I get back from visiting my dad in arizona in a couple weeks :>
So RDash,how's it goin'?
Get somepony to make it rain
03am I the only one here who lives with both parents?
welp, i found out why Spark is such a popular fanfic. And i don't think it was Spark itself, but the continuation
03and whos parents aren't divorced o.o
Spark?What's that?
Good, not much going on but I guess that might be a good thing
COntinuation?
My parents aren't
o.o
02^
02o.o
Spark was an 8-part fanfic, and it has a single continuation chapter after the end of the original storyline
What kind of fanfic?
yeah
shipping/grimdark
that's why I didn't get a birthday present from him
02Soo... anyway this gives me the chance to buy a new console
What happens in it?
the wii is supposed to be my present XD
03Ray, how many times do I have to prove it to you that your Wii will work just fne :L|
02I should do a poll in the forums and start a console war |D
03*fine
JUST KEEP YOUR WII
:3
Luna falls ill, Twilight is called to keep an eye on her since Celestia is busy most of the time
03I mean

Hah
whut?
03when I was off at college
03I took my modded Wii with me
03my sisters were like ":( but we want to play"
03and so my mom bought them their own
03now that I"m back home...
03we have two XD
But the only "Spark" fanfic I read was "With a Spark",a Dash/Spitfire shipping fic.
03so my modded Wii is just sitting in a box in the storage room
03and I might not be going back to college until October
Spitfire is now forever a bitch in my eyes.
03and MODCHIPS YO
HEY DRF
03why
03*what
Can I have your modded wii
DragonRage is ashamed to admit that he hasn't read nearly enough fanfic.
02LOL Modchips
;.;
03why did I type why
03um
Lolwat
03can you pay me?
http://www.halolz.com/
oops
Only by Amazon
02Why modchip'd it when you can hack it .-.
03XD
I still need to actually get to reading past the prologue of Past sins, or Sins Past, whichever it was.
But eventually
03Ray
http://www.halolz.com/2011/07/24/video-nah-avi/
03because
Maybe :P
03I can just take ISOs
03burn them to a DVD
03and put it in the console
03and it plays
03no homebrew required
03I obviously have HBC too...
Well,i DO have a folder full of fanfics.And BTW,it's Past sins.
I loved HBC
03but I have never had any luck with disc loaders, they don't work
03and the hard drive loader, well, don't feel like using a hard drive LOL
...for playing music and emulators
Or DVDs xD
03WAD Manager or gtfo
03I mean, seriously, who pays for WiiWare?
/me gtfo
I do
Deal with it
:D
03I pity the fool who doesn't know how to pirate
I pity the fool who does pirate
Lazy scum
:3
03HML can I have all the money you wasted on stuff you could have gotten for free? :P
KILLEN FLAU
It's hard to find good ones, some can be really bad
Sure!
02500gb Disk Drives Ftw?
I don't care
03LOL
03inb4 pay me in Nintendo points and I give you the WiiWare
I read Cupcakes 0.0
Oh,OF COURSE!AN AXE!LIKE IT WASN'T ENOUGH LIKE LEFT 4 DEAD,NOW THEY PUT AN AXE IN THE GAME?WHAT THE HELL MAN?
03nah
I have no Wii anyway
;.;
03EW COMMERCIAL PIRACY, it's completely against my morals
03I'll give away copies
03but I won't take money for them
I also need to get to writing fanfics, too. =/ I actually just finished one today. That I started today. That surprised me.
03it's just... a lot worse, you konw?
02LOL Commercial piracy
03*know
I bet you're scared of Pinkie now RDash.
02That's a local sport in Venezuela, lmfao
03XD
03then I'd be a hero down there
See, poor country ;<
Hah
03I'd just give the stuff away for free
I can't look at her the same anymore
lol
brb,gotta eat mah cheezburgers.
Around 4,280 words, for the Writers Training Grounds event thing.
02LOLyeah
03though I must say, having my friends ask me for movies every day gets annoying
03luckily people don't anymore XD
02However since Piracy is "legal" over there
Anyway, who needs WADs when you have ported Emulators and ROMS >:3
02Everyone knows how to pirate |D
03Sony's own insurers are suing the gaming giant over the PSN hack, claiming they are not liable to pay for any lawsuit claims and damages from future legal actions.
03Zurich believes that the general cover policy that Sony has purchased does not cover the expected fallout from the PSN hack, which saw millions of user's data being stolen, as well as a month long outage for PS3 gamers. Zurich claims the policy only covers "bodily injury, property damage or personal and advertising injury", and so would not cover the after effects of the PSN hacking saga.
03Zurich also revealed that "55 cases have been brought against Sony in the US as a result of the attacks", and has also filled separate lawsuits filled Sony's other insurers, to get them to take up more of the slack.
And who needs ROMs when you have the real cart/console
03Sony estimates that they are set to lose $171 million in costs due to the PSN hacking and outage.
03This is great news :D
The think is that if anypony would do what she did in that fic, it would definitely be her
thing*
Yay
Can we hack Kinect next?
Alright, since my SilverMane account is still in use due to the stupid computer failing, this will have to do for now
03it's already been hacked
03Microsoft even released a SDK
I know XD
DCD, the quality of the stream is so bad I want to cry...
At least MS does it right
03Yep
03well
Who needs a xbox when you have a PC
:P
03they're still evil, but they're the least evil of the 3
...OMG PIZZAPONY
03Nintendo is pretty evil now too
Apple > Sony > Nintendo > MS - In Evil
Or something like that
03I mean, wtf is this crap releasing Wii/DSi updates that do absolutely nothing but disable homebrew
03that's just pathetic
yes Bjornfot? Are you... *hungry?*
Better low quality stream than stream so laggy it's unwatchable, Bjorn.
I know :<
hi yall
03and as for the 3DS
Hi Elky :D
03there's a thing they force you to accept
yeah, I'm hungry for some SHIPPING!
02LOL updating Wii/DSi
Elky!
Really .v.
Wow
03that says "We can do whatever we want whenever we want, including bricking the console that you paid for, if we don't like what you do with it"
I know
03and there's nothing anybody can do about it
Install homebrew
03besides what I do and keep the wireless disabled
I guess this is still killing floor?
That blocks the updats
*updates
XD
03can't spy on me if I don't connect my 3DS online, now, can you? >:P
03there is no 3DS homebrew yet.
I don't think I want to be the guilty person this time, though. Dman still hates me for yesterday...
03well
03maybe
Heh
03but the DSi still hasn't been hacked

So bawwdates
That's some damn sweet music DCD.

Okay, DCD... tell me why people like CoD - especially MW and forward
DragonRage feels for you, DCD.
CoD has a good story usually, and is fun?
I still use my DVR/VCR xD
03eh
MW1 was pretty great.
03I use my computer as a home-made DVR
i think he meant my fast chat thingy, silvermane
Or did I misread
I know that xD
MP is addicting.
03Screw having a finite amount of storage
03no
03I mean
Who could hate ponies? :(
That is all.
Hey, i liked world at war. my face cod so far and i've played em all
but i have actually made some porper fics too
03most people go "Why record movies off TV when I can just buy/pirate the DVD/Blu-Ray?"
story in a shooter? no thanks
Though I don't play it much at all.
03I do, because I like TV edits
you wrote a fanfic bjornfot? on here? how did it go
03because EW SWEARING
03it's fun to see what they change words to
Bjornfot did about u and me D:
Yes,do tell!
I really want to get some pony swag, but I have no idea where to get it in Sweden.
Did they do a edit of BTTF1?
/me performs poorly for Kosoveon on purpose
http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Bj%C3%B6rnfot
http://pastebin.com/CiTRfFSv
I think I saw one once
xD
lul
Shooters can have stories. They should.
/me watches Kosoveon get 20th place in a contest of 10 people
Ex: Fallout 3.
Shockwave Flash = super ultra mega epic FAIL
keeps crashing
MW2 is a great game - it's just so OVERrated it's now considered awful : /
Shooter/RPG, though.
Fallout 3 is like... 90% VATS for me.
What browser are you using?
MW2 has no dedicated servers. Fail.
I saw him start hat fic last night, didn't get to see it finish.
Shooters can have stories, but it depends on the type.
/me shrugs
Google Chrome
Dashite - eks bawx
Your PC sucks
RobotPinkie: O MY GOSH! HOLY MOLEY! Svensk broder?
you'll do better next year
Or flash
yeah
03Back to the Future has one of the best edits
and I got an error message with a bunch of Chinese writing 0__o
Having a heavy story would have ruined Bulletstorm.
The only fail for CoD for me is that it's published by Activision.
03"Jeez Louise, doc!"

Dman: FPS on controller. Also fail. :p

o yeah
^ im NOT kidding watch any good plays on any fps on consoles
And Shadows of the damned can get away with a lot of story due to proper pacing, a mostly lack of cutscenes, and the fact that the plot is funny.
03is them editing "by terrorists" out of the letter he writes to the Doc
you strafe 60% aim and actually aim for like 40%
03"You will be shot"
03etc
03XD
RobotPinkie... broderhov
Butthurt much? xD
I didn't even notice that edit
9Signal is up
03here lemme find it
03Yeah I didn't either
9starting in five minutes
03until someone pointed it out
I use strafe aiming in older FPSs.
I record TS because renting costs money and my freind has EWW 700mb 700*400px rips

Silverscreen, you poor bastard, he's fucking huge!
the community isn't very open to new members
Why was i kicked?
Poor Silverscreen -and- Silvermane.
basically don't dis on policenauts being streamed
because it's ok to not like things
11SilverMane2: ...do I want to know how you know that...?
9>implying we don't kick for laughs here 95 percent of the time

I've been here for 3-4 years, and in my entire time here the community has lost too many and gained too few

sure why not
Pattyrick, I think the IRC community is honestly more important than the forums
7I personally think that we should almost 'feature' people who visit our site and contribute to it. :P
Because the IRC community is the TST community that constantly visits

he's a huge sea serpent

We don't want their inbox to be full immediately, GL :P

Oh, Japan.
I just noticed.
How the ef can you even have zero gravity sex? how can you apply force when floating around?
Guess I'm 0% kicked. ^_^
9I remember this challenge is actually real tough
What IS the secret dungeon Silverscreen?
12only because you asked for it
12I did not become a member at that time though
inb4 each target getting hit twice
brb
Exactly Bjornfot
06I'm nice unless people make it clear they do not deserve it :U
It's Japan, Bjorn. Kojima ain't gotta explain shit

ciao Dman.

I haven't seen any newcomers at all :|
Other than Chao
and you say it's not the forum?
7Hmm..
they just come and leave

that's easy enough for forums
not for IRC though

@pony Jesus

6 Jesus is 13Diamond 6Ti15a6ra
11Holy Ghost = Cheerilee = Batman
I feel that one reason newcomers are rare to the IRC is because of 'disagreements'
of a certain kind
don't take that literally
nope
and Pattyrick, I don't think that has anything to do with it
particularly people who like certain things that a certain other person doesn't like
lol
If Batman were a major figure in a religion, I'd probably be religious.
and well, I don't pay attention to the forum but why force people to chat who don't want to? we get people like HML who use the IRC before joining the forum
@pony Allah

06o-o

the whole "bring more people to IRC"
11Spike can't be both.
sounds like forcing to me
@pony Abe Vigoda
6 Abe Vigoda is 14Hoity-15Toity
invitation != forcing
Spike is both past and future.
@pony Bill Gates

And if they're not, then they need to learn
(like me sometimes :B)
7As in where?
you'd have to be blind to not know about it
7The community tab?
Someone needs to get that number up higher.
11The magnet says no to shipping in here.
hell, if you guys read the logs that I gave of me when I first joined
and half the forum topics about the chat
I wonder if anypony would be ballsy enough to make a Pegacorn/Dash shipping fic.
No, the magnet says there is no shipping here.
and compare it to my personality now
12Well, some people don't
I read them
you'll know that I've come a long way

Silly Pegacorn. We only ship SilverMane in here!

Yay.I shall never be shipped.My day is made.
I can live with that...
mostly Xeli, Drake and my other close friends
12drf has the game crap XD
10@silvermane I don't think that would work, since I was born without an imagination

12i don't even know all the controls drf
Spitfire is a bitch
12i don't know how to boost or brake or anything
I hope all of you've noticed that TST has its own "inner circle"
Solution: Something that gets newbies friends and keeps them here, but nothing specifically yet
remap them to the arrow keys
7Yep.
which is bloody damn obvious to newcomers
12i know and i can't figure out how to redo them

one that's both unique and original and keeps people here
06but make people more daring to step outside it and take in the terrain? :P
But some show it less obviously than others
11awesome.
No one ever suspects the Fluttershy!
Spitfire got Rainbow drunk,banged her,then left her and pretty much said:"Hey Rainbow!FUCK YOU!"
And some even invite others into that inner circle
I don't follow circles :P
That's what I think we're not doing
most of my friends don't like my other friends

/me 11wanders through the town of ponyville as dark clouds loom overhead. Oddly enough, the pegasi ponies didn't plan for an overcast, so that alone was strange. Ponyville appeared to be deserted.

7Well, as for the WB messages:

Hmmmm.
11Sapphire Shores + Twilight Sparkle Fanfic. Go!

12it's not
so did Polarefire come back yet?
I'm at a hotel for the night. Headed for Niagara Falls then Windsor

I wonder how many people play the TCG

very true
I'll try make a java app or website-based app
probably easiest and most compatible
That's a good idea
also, TST seems to hate Macs
so it'll work :P

best quote I've seen today
Luna pouted back at her sibling. "You're my sister, not my mother!" she snapped back finally. "It's always 'Luna do the washing up' or 'Luna don't throw the world into eternal darkness' with you, isn't it! Well I've had enough! I'm going to find somewhere that ponies will appreciate me, where I don't have to stand in your shadow!"
delete the colour and keep the outline
7Digital art does not work that way. XD
7Unless you have the original layers.
Portal connections for new members?
:D
distracts from point of website, nvm :\
12how so, Q@uan?
12-@
7And I'd think you'd customize the features of the bird, like crest, wings, tail, etc.
12Again Pattyrick, it has to be Pokemon related
allo
yup
yes
'sup gummy
I still like that custom bird feature

Wouldn't it depend on the version of OSX?
12you need a laptop/PC that can handle it
7Yep.
and I'm not even sure if I'm good enough to code it
12and they need to NOT HATE YOU >_____>;;;;;;;;;;;
7It's actually quite easy to do that. :P
7No?
12which they don't
12@me
12they hate me ;-;
the bird stuff is easy but the actual coding isn't
robotpinkie: this computer hasn't been connected to internet in like, ever. It is still using the safari browser of 2004.
easiest would be using VB
I'll think about it
7Ah.
You'll need to give me quite some time though
7That's fine.
Ah okay, I really dunno. Check what version of flash is suggested on the official download site?
I'm busy and I haven't programmed for months
I know that old versions of OSX get left behind fairly quickly. :(
I barely managed to make my own webpage using notepad in 3rd grade
I can explain to you how to build a hydraulic launch roller coaster, but not how to fix coding on TST
7Lol.

I can't stream pony episodes.

Why is that?
Not allowed?
Because we just streamed them all recently.
Yeah.
did they just kiss?
I see -slump-
And because it's unfair on the people who get to choose episodes on movie night.
If I've streamed the episodes already.
That makes sense.
let's watch the MLP: Mentally Advanced Abridged Series
Could you stream "The Crazy Nastyass Honey Badger"?
Ok.
haha
:D
I have a similar problem, but it's the MLP theme song...
I'll do one of what SilverMane said, then what you said.
Oh wait

12As for card scans, why not use the scans they have on Pokemon.com?
now for child abuse
>implying the rest of the video wasn't
but it gets so, So much... worse
12All you need to do is take a png screen shot of it XD
12Then crop
or
just learn how to copy image urls
:0

lol
Pop tarts commercial?
XD didnt see that coming
OMG PLANE
ouch
I'm never holding a balloon again
Lol.
12That’s the problem, the pictures on Pokemon.com are flash based
Wow.
Raining kids.
I now feel fully justified for all the times I used balloons as punching bags.
the best part is that this was all drawn by hand, no computers until sound was added
6pokebeach?

I know she does
7.5 hours here.
12then you just ewed her D:
and I keep telling her
As for part 3... good luck.
making it != copyrighting it
12the way i see it
technically TST site is not. actually copyrighted at all
12if i create something into this world
I'm going
12and someone wants to use it
12i feel honored
by the definition of copyrights
same
you finished it?
I just say
last page
yes
12it's only when they claim they made the piece of work
give credit where credit is due
hooray
12when i get irritated
^
Curse you dashite, your name drive mo to stare at fallout equestria till it updates
that's plaigarism
entirely different
me*
Final readthrough... fixing grammar
etc
12Well, she did make a lot of the site
yes but
/me lies head down in computer lab... wakes up next day, suddenly tye-die hair
in order for something to be actually copyrighted
/me tents fingers "Excellent..."
you have to file paperwork for it
/me wishes it were his pink hair so that it would be easier to get his Fluttershy parody character approved for larping
12Which you could not possibly do for TST xD
12ouuu
12wonderful show name
12pizza paradise
12lol
What fanfic is he/are you making?
he is shipping me
GL, exactly
like everyone else on this site
to China?
but arti insists it's © anyway
hahahahahaha
and I'm just like nope
i'm so funny
... clever boy, but no. with anyting that moves
same with dA and saying "© 2011 artist"
i've been shipped with rarity, the CMCs, and several viewers of the stream so far
99% of that is a complete lie
12Well, if it scares away dumb people from using her stuff
unless you filed it with an actual copyright office
eh
12i heard one time
rules, and copyrights, are made to be broken ;p
12there was a program out there
12that let you play the pokemon tcg online with virutal cards
12using actual pokemon card scans

“Gaah Stupid stupid STUPID!” Silvermane shouted at himself. “WHY did I listen to that pony? I knew things would end up this way!” Silvermane was running hard, hooves thumping at the ground below him. Behind him, he could hear the metallic clank of the guard's armor serving as an ever-present reminder of why he was on the run.
It was supposed to be easy money, a 'nothing any intelligent unemployed pony couldn't handle' type of job. All he had to do was take this package and deliver it to this guy, and that was 100 bits in his pocket...
He mentoined something about the owner couldn't be seen delivering it to the new guy... Silvermane knew something was up, sure, but how big could these small town operations be anyway? Apparently... Very big.
The package contained none other than Princess Celestia's horn ring, a 5,000 year old relic considered beyond priceless by those who even knew of it's existence.
“Gah!” Silver yelled as a parasprite smacked him in the face. He had to think fast if he was going to get out of this one... By now he would be in the Everfree forest, possibly miles away from civilization. He had to mix up these guards if he was ever going to get away...
A hard right, then a left into a thicket of trees. That should buy him some time... Then a few circles here, some turns there...
lmfao
Silvermane ran on through the night, trees wooshing by at a brisk pace. Something unnatural caught his eye. Wait? Was that a house??
Silvermane screeched to a halt and turned around. There, carved out of a tree, was a small cottage adorned with masks and trinquets. Silvermane had never seen anything like it. Well... Can't hurt to see if they atleast know a good place to hide. Silvermane walked up and knocked on the door.
A strange pony with a striped coat opened the door. “Yes?” “Umm yes. How to put this. I have some guards following me for something I didn't do... Do you know a good place I can go hide?” She stared back out at him for a minute.
12[23:10:38] * Dragoran tickles Umbreon :3
“A noble heart is rare, I will help, do not despair. 'Tis the town of Ponyville you seek. Go there, it is 1 mile east.” The strange pony slammed the door.
o-o
“Well that was weird.” Silvermane looked up at the night sky... He found the north star, turned right, and started running again. By the time Silver reached the the edge of Ponyville, daylight was just beginning to show over the horizon. “Alright, gotta do this quick.”

02So...
12i thought that was you
Silvermane found the town's post office, and removed the small brown box. He wrote a short letter of apology describing his position, and the 2 ponies who were involved in the deal, and placed it inside the box along with the ring. He wrote down the address of the royal palace in Canterlot and put it in the drop box.
That was me lol
12how am i supposed to know that
“Well hopefully they'll understand that.” Silver felt his stomach growl. “Well now time to go get some food...” He looked around the quaint little town of ponyville. He noticed a sign to the left that read “Sugarcube Corner Sweet Shop” Several cakes and deserts lined the inside of the shop, and all pretty cheap at that.
“That should be great” Silver thought to himself as he made his way over to the store. It was closed this early in the morning, wouldn't open for another 2 hours atleast. Silver decided to wait and sat down on the front porch of the store.
12anyway~~
He admired the town. It was quaint, small. Very quiet this early, he couldn't see any other ponies around. It was so peaceful he could almost take a nap... Silver heard air moving in the distance. It was getting closer, and louder...
“What on equestr-” SHWOOOSH!! Silver saw a flash of light that looked like... a rainbow fly by at blinding speed. Before he could even turn his head, it looped up around the store and thudded down on the ground next to him.
12i need to think if i should make this tcg forum post
12or not
It was a Pegasus pony. With a rainbow mane and tail of all things. “Hey! I don't think I've ever seen you around town b'fore! And usually nobody's up this early except me on rain days. Name's rainbow!” She held out her hoof. Silvermane was a bit shocked. He hadn't expected this at all.
/me beats up Dragoran
“Oh, hey. I'm Silvermane” He shook her hoof, trying unsuccessfully to hide his surprise. He was impressed. She was athletic, and a very talented flier at that. Her eyes, were full of personality and life. Silver felt like he could stare into them forever...
lrn2/whois
02Nnnyerp
“So what brings you to ponyville, Silvermane?” she asked. “Oh! err.. that's a long story. I'll be staying here for a few days I guess.” “Oh. Are you one of those government ponies?” “Well... I guess you could say that.” He paused for a moment.
D:
12i was being pulled away
“Well can you tell me? I've got some time to kill. And Sugarcube Corner doesn't open till 8 anyway, if that's what you're waiting for. Hey I know! I could show you around Ponyville since you're going to stay for a few days.” Silvermane thought about it for a moment. She was attractive, definitely full of personality.
12i didn't have time to whois
“Ok sure, I don't have anything better to do.” “Well c'mon! We'll start down by Sweet apple acres I guess.”
XD
It only took them about 45 minutes to cover the town. They swapped stories and talked the entire time. Silver decided to go ahead and tell rainbow about the trouble he was in.
“Hmm well I'm sure things will work out for you here. We're not exactly a famous hideout town anyway. You could even stay at my house if you wanted, my friend twilight could do a cloudwalking spell, since we don't have a hotel in town. I mean, if you wanted to that is...” She looked down and swiped her hoof ground a few times.
What was that in her voice? Anxiety? Oh well. To early in the morning to know. “That would be great, I've got the money from the job but that's it.” “Well Twilight won't be up for a few hours... Wanna go for a walk by the river? We've still got time.” “Mmm, I guess so.”
The river was beautiful. Turns out the spring-fed water stayed cool and crystal clear year-round. A mild current swept the water along at a brisk pace. Rainbow stared off into the water. Silver noticed her normally strong eyes soften, and she relaxed visibly.
“I've always loved the river... It's so beautiful and happy. It reminds me of.. of my parents.” She sighed and looked down. Silver couldn't think of anything to say, so he walked over and nuzzled her neck. “Hey, its ok” “I'm sorry, Silvermane..” She wiped away a tear and regained her composure. She looked back up at him, her personality back at full swing.
Well anyway, did you just come here to look?” She launched herself off the ground and dived into the water. Silver winced when the cold water splashed out onto him. “Oh. Well I see how it is then!” Silver called.
He backed up a bit, and took off towards the water. “Geronimo!” Silver yelled as he felt his hooves leave the ground. He hit the water and immediately regretted it. It. Was. COLD.
They splashed, played games, and chased each other through the water, occasionally getting swept up in the current and having to swim extra hard to get back up river. Silvermane couldn't help but laugh and enjoy himself, despite the trouble he was in.
Both ponies tired quickly in the water, and it wasn't long before neither of them could swim any longer. Once they were back on the bank, they realized just how cold the water was. The wind picked up a little, making rainbow shiver. She scooted up beside Silvermane in an attempt to keep warm. “Brrrr I wish it would hurry up and get warm out here,” she said.
Silvermane looked over at her. He fought a turmoil of feelings. Here he was, a wanted pony on the run, and he had just met this awesome pony whom he thought at least.. he was falling in LOVE with. “Naah it can't be true...”
“What was that?”Rainbow turned and looked up at him, her beautiful eyes felt like they were staring into his soul... Alright that's it. Silvermane leaned in and locked his lips with hers, in a kiss that sent fireworks through his body. Rainbow stifled her surprise, and returned the kiss. Silver put his arm around her neck and pulled her in closer.
12yeah laugh it up
They broke the kiss and stared into each other's eyes. Silvermane noticed rainbow's eyes had softened again, and he saw a side of this pony that he hadn't noticed before. She was now relaxed, almost shy. He could tell his was the side she normally tried to mask with her outgoing personality.
Neither pony could understand exactly what just happened... but they liked it.
Silvermane reached over and nuzzled rainbow's cheek. He kissed her neck softly and listened to her slow, steady breathing. If he placed his ear to her chest, he could hear the steady rhythm her heart. He pulled back and looked into her eyes again. “Silver?” she said softly.
“hmm?” “You know you can stay longer than a few days if you want.” Silvermane sighed. He looked up at the sky, the sun was still low on the horizon. “I think that can be arranged” She smiled, and let her head rest across his neck.
“I think the rain will have to wait today.” He sighed and settled down on the bank, the quiet sound of the river behind him slowly lulling both ponies to sleep.
