:P
how quaint
YES
STREAMING BILL HAS BEEN AXED
fuck yeah
yea, but the few they might have made an example of would have been like :(
Woo
Outnumbered.
OUTNUMBERED
it's time!
I was kind of surprised to find out that the kids make up most of their lines.
@too_quietmeter The stream
6 The stream is 31% too_quiet. (858)
They just have a vague guideline, then make up their lines themselves.
It's not possible.
*amplifier*
Yeah, the amplifier would be a function of the sound card.
LOOOOUDEEEER
Mine doesn't have it.
uh, no
eh, it's fine. i could still hear 'PLAYGUUUUU' :P
Uh, yes. :P
you can intercept and manipulate the output sound with a virtual amplifier
MFW I checked and was told that's impossible.
it is?
I dunno, I was told you can't do it with software.
In the UK?
Ages ago.
4th of July
but you can do it with the sound that goes to the streaming tool
Then every day from then on other than weekends.
!
Well if you still think it's possible, go find a program that does that. :P
is there any difference with the UK and US show?
It's probably not easy, but it should work in theory.
FUCK

Nah, turns out it was something else.
...why would one need 2TB?
porn?
100s of films/games/programs/etc.
Yea prince-dari's right
films? pfft
Handheld GPS.
such as 1080p MOVIAS 10GIGAS
per movie
But I do like my tech, yes. :P
=]
also that
10 of them = 300 GB.
games
i have 200GB of wii vidya on my WBFS partition
also though tprince-dari 'scrub' the ps3 games
sometimes they can be like 5GB but the file has 20GB of nothing
>watching 'meet Rarity' on hasbro.com/es_es aka Spain.
Da foque?
i can forgive the 'celestia only alicorn' bit i guess
yea but i meant
the vid said 'only one with a magical horn AND wings'
I thought it was McCloud?
that's ifne cuz ep1 luna on moon
/me has a 20TB RAID 6 array
but i can't believe I heard that about rarity
still watching the other 'meet the's
aaaadn yup same in spanish 'loves visiting for sweets'
Dragoran, you are a 6Meowth.
Lol fail.
Ok, I think THIS package is my hard drive.
: D
/me wiped a bead of sweat off his brow. his hands were shaking. It was Time. He brought the radio up to his ear, the receiver next to his mouth, and he said only
/me 'The package is ready.'

Lawl.
DURRR 'HD video'
define 'HD video,' oh bauwx
I'd assume 1080p :P
Well even then eyedunno
Ashes to Ashes?
Nice.
the 1080p pony hdtv rips are 745-746 MiB each
hmm
Yup same, yea they are
and are 22 minutes +- one second
and they're mkv rite?
x264
if they were avi they'd be like 1GB and if they were eyedunno mp4 they'd probably be like 1.2GB
!
>mp4 larger than avi
Pony HD doesn't really count as HD.
:P
Since you can't really get HD vectors.
720p colourcorrected are like 720MB
LOL
FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF MUSIC
doesn't the 720ps use the same codecs, though?
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
OH YEAH
LOL
=]
at least the non-color corrected ones
but I find the ones i have for 720p are KAWAIIIII~~~~~desu on my 1080p LED telly
really now
the only advantage with 1080p is no marks
*720
:O yea 720p are unmarked not 1080 >_<
inb4 they only release 720p DVDs
http://i.imgur.com/o5sb3.png
ok the comparison i made in a jiffy here sucks a little : /
and you can't compare resolution
theres a teenie tiny difference in that the right looks a tiny bit more colourful - in motion the difference is a little bigger
wait WAT
?
Reactions?
where did you get those 720ps, Dman?
Ponychan

Motivation is easy when it's something you enjoy.
i DON'T enjoy physical excercise.
I have a neat quote from one of my childhood friends:
i kinda enjoy it but sometimes i really don't want to do it
"Any physical activity that doesn't lead to orgasm is unnecessary."
>physical activity
>fun

0I made that picture.
Ok, and that's fine
03VMWare
03;P
:o
06HML
the iPod touch is kinda blah, I have to admit
06absolutly nothing
as a pure MP3 player
0The thrashers moved to winnipeg.
Wait, blah
03If I want to use GarageBand (why would I WANT to?)
0Yes.
03I could run OSX using VMWare
& GB
03and do it in a window
03:P
03I even have sound working
I've been following the news.
03which is... kinda hard to do
03;P
the newer Nanos are blah as well
the iLife suite, but nm else is worth it
I liked my 4th gen Nano, that was fine
EW
yuck :\
03I know right
The Nanos were...decent
All I can say
The 1st one SUCKED
03Motorola Xoom anyone?
0we still have the Hawks though
That should NOT have been the replacement for the Nano
and blah
Lapblet anyone?
I don't like the Xoom

03how is a hard drive not more convenient
Just access from anywher
06DROPBOX!
03No sitting and waiting for something to load
it has happened before.
How is it conveient to not have local storae
03I do dropbox from my Android...
06DROPBOX WITH ONLY 1GB INSTEAD OF MY FREE 2GB!!
03^
Blah
03I dunno, I don't see any redeeming quality to the iPad

03:P
0Which one is the best, IMO
0?
03speaking of which I need to install my HTTP server again but I'll do it later
0My favorite is the text logo.
03Pattyrick
06i use it for pictures, handy if you're everywhere
Yes?
03so it's built in
03:P
The text logo? Ewww.
03pictures, well, how many fricking cameras do you need?
One billion
30 MP3 players
0The airplane (or aeroplane) one is the worst IMO
0not the left onwe
03contacts, settings, etc
03your actual data is stored locally
0the hockey stick one
I do wish they hadn't used the F-18 on the logo.
06brb~
and it's a different concept, not the same kind of thing
07Rar!

:P
03so they deserved it
03:)
I never heard of it before

Hey Patty, is the iPad revolutionary?
03Pattyrick really needs to watch Pirates of Silicon Valley
Yeah
Nice movie
iPod was probably one of the first brands of mass-produced MP3 players on the market
03nope

I think it is
Montreal needs to go back to this song. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfTpGKJqROY

03it was just the first to ADVERTISE
03There were plenty of them
03I had mp3 players long before iPods came out
Hey guys!
WB
03and they used SD cards
it helped restart the tablet boom; I'd never seen anything like it
0this is good
but I never saw people with MP3 players before iPods
after iPods came, it seemed like a lot of people got MP3 players
not even iPods, MP3 players just became more popular
*shot*
I liek
03that's basically an SD card slot with buttons
0wanna see the one i went to?

03:P
Nice!
On a MP3 player

0Thrash gave me a high five :)
03>The ability to record FM radio as mp3 files
Apple too AGEDS

I've been doing crappy at Killing Floor lately.
9well YT links are pretty much for real preshows
9this is more of "I'm playing Killing Floor atm, guess I could stream it as well"
But the best part about my iPod Nanos is that they never seem to want to connect to my computers
03LOL
03dude
The cables just (don't) work

Speaking of L4D2...
I should really try those maps that Sathi gave.
12hiiii
02you didn't brought a wii earlier
02Now I'm in europe
02We can't play MHT >(
why? O_o
and there's a reason for that
my Dad's gonna get me one
:D
/me also has Brawl now
02And I don't have a wii now
02Irony, lmao
yep
/me cuts commercials
Inglip went in that building.He didn't like it.

02Depends, lawl
02Can be anywhere between from 2 weeks to 2 years

You should maybe hide in that building.
oh
Dman: Maybe we could sometime.
02Diferent electricity .-.
02Sooo... Wheeeeee
That was no problem
03then buy a $5 transformers

Power useage
Awww shit...
03the Wii has a power brick, not just a plug
Think about it :P
03usually, that brick can use different voltages
02Bermuda uses 220V 60h or 110V 50h?
US
We run on US xd
03hm
03though
03can the Wii's power brick do both 120 and 240V?
03It might be able to
02Nope
03you sure about that?
I dobut it without modding
03well
02because the Electricity frecuency screws up
03that's part of the plug?
03What do you think that does, magic?
/me points at the Electrity frecuency change 50h to 60h
03o.o
03other way around
0360Hz in America, 50Hz in Europe
US is 60
03yeah
03and techncailly it's 59.94, not 60
/me hides
03but never mind me, I'm just a nerd
Europeanjs are slow anyway *shot*
I know
03well that's where PAL and NTSC come from
Just like how it isn'
02lol.
t
0325 frames per second @ TV in Europe
0350Hz / 2
03magic
Exactly 30FPS, it's 29.94
:P
03and ~29.97fps is ~59.94/2
Or however it can go
Blaa
Ohwell
03and then you get film which uses 23.976fps and screws both up :D
02loool
031080p is usually 24fps
03usually.
Lol, it's always interesting what's streaming when I get here. Are you actually playing?
03yeah um

Hi
You got a break from clearing the sky?
03LOL sawing off
03nah, just use an adapter
/me again points at the Electricity Frecuency
03heck if you're going to be there long term
03I could MAIL you an adapter
03Ray
It converts anyway
03No country in the world uses 240V and 60Hz
Hurp
03^
Oh.

03now that I"m back home...
03we have two XD
But the only "Spark" fanfic I read was "With a Spark",a Dash/Spitfire shipping fic.
03and I might not be going back to college until October
03and MODCHIPS YO

03I can just take ISOs

03and put it in the console
03and it plays
03no homebrew required
Well,i DO have a folder full of fanfics.And BTW,it's Past sins.
I loved HBC
03but I have never had any luck with disc loaders, they don't work
03and the hard drive loader, well, don't feel like using a hard drive LOL

03EW COMMERCIAL PIRACY, it's completely against my morals
03I'll give away copies
03but I won't take money for them
03it's just... a lot worse, you konw?
02LOL Commercial piracy
03*know
02That's a local sport in Venezuela, lmfao
03XD
03then I'd be a hero down there
See, poor country ;<
Hah
I can't look at her the same anymore
lol
Around 4,280 words, for the Writers Training Grounds event thing.
02LOLyeah
03luckily people don't anymore XD
02However since Piracy is "legal" over there
03Sony estimates that they are set to lose $171 million in costs due to the PSN hacking and outage.
03This is great news :D
thing*
Can we hack Kinect next?
03it's already been hacked
03Microsoft even released a SDK
I know XD
At least MS does it right
03Yep
03well
:P
03they're still evil, but they're the least evil of the 3
...OMG PIZZAPONY
03Nintendo is pretty evil now too
Or something like that
03I mean, wtf is this crap releasing Wii/DSi updates that do absolutely nothing but disable homebrew
03that's just pathetic
I know :<
hi yall
03and as for the 3DS
Hi Elky :D

yeah, I'm hungry for some SHIPPING!
02LOL updating Wii/DSi
Elky!
Wow

03and there's nothing anybody can do about it
Install homebrew
I guess this is still killing floor?
That blocks the updats
*updates
XD
03there is no 3DS homebrew yet.
I don't think I want to be the guilty person this time, though. Dman still hates me for yesterday...
02<drfsupercenter> 03and there's nothing anybody can do about it ... yet(?) - Fixed

03I mean
That is all.

03most people go "Why record movies off TV when I can just buy/pirate the DVD/Blu-Ray?"

Though I don't play it much at all.
03I do, because I like TV edits
03because EW SWEARING

Shooters can have stories. They should.

MW2 has no dedicated servers. Fail.
I saw him start hat fic last night, didn't get to see it finish.
Shooters can have stories, but it depends on the type.

7I'm actually hesitant to look.
To touch a woman's breasts.

I'm not proud of it, but hey, everyone is an idiot at one point or another
/me 7hmms.
Sadly, a long time ago...

oops wrong link .-.
Trolluigi
06:3
7Lol at that last bit.
12You where a interesting noob :3
Aw okay.
/me runs
7(I read the first area, then skipped to about middle, then read the rest.
7)
poor raiden
FAITO!
I cringe when I see those logs honestly
lol
But yeah, I'll make my point now
...
As annoying, stupid and retarded as I was
7I'm still thinking about TST's stagnancy.
HAX
ciao Dman.
The community of TST, or at least some people within it, particularly Xeli
I see crazy shit when i drink.
Good night Dman
The last time DragonRage was in a dungeon, he remembered to bring a spare lockpick.
*dreams
=/ Then he broke it trying to escape.
Continued to talk to me and caused me to be involved with it more
12How do you think I was as a noob?
We're just not as welcoming anymore I guess
=]
11oh yeah, I kicked him.
they're just not staying in the community
Keeping is the issue....
night
7Hmm, then.
night dman
Goodnight
7Do they just avoid it or do they come and leave/
7?*
11G'night
299 points? is that good?
MFW he's already gone...
Night Dman.Don't drink too much or else you'll get greated in a dungeon.
and you say it's not the forum?
7Hmm..
they just come and leave
06Something should be in place that motivates people to stick around for long enough to perhaps network a little bit and find a buddy or two
He's back
agreed
that's easy enough for forums
not for IRC though
06ofc
the IRC is entirely based upon the communities
11@leveragemeter
6 You are 91% leverage. (107)
there are NO IRC features, literally
11I am Leverage
@metermeter meter

I... guess... that's... fine too.
Garbage
%Btest
12Yes, we should get people on IRC
hmm
No bold
As I said before
but the problem is that not everybody knows how to use IRC
7We could make the IRC even more prominent. :P
the entire community is literally the IRC
Close enough.
Does that mean Silvermane is my waifu?
7And its simplistic layout.
my waifu is Luna
11Granny hugs!

I could code an even simpler layout but I'm lazy

I think the first step to fixing this stagnancy is for the entire community to start opening up to newcomers
Wrong

Intruding would be sending them messages every 5 seconds
I hate it when people try and start something with me via PM or similar
just sending 1 message isn't bad

It's a good start
pick and choose size, shape, colors, textures, beaks, wings, etc.

but I can probably manage
it is a lie

therefore windows-only
7Hrm.
but then that'd be a program
12it's a bit limited but yeah
I'll try make a java app or website-based app
probably easiest and most compatible
That's a good idea
also, TST seems to hate Macs

I quit using it in 2004 and am glad I did
7I think you should make it compatible, for the newbs. :P
yeah
I'll need templates to work with
that basically sums it up
it'd probably be best in java
but I dunno

Wouldn't it depend on the version of OSX?
12you need a laptop/PC that can handle it
7Yep.
and I'm not even sure if I'm good enough to code it
12and they need to NOT HATE YOU >_____>;;;;;;;;;;;

7No?
12which they don't
12@me
12they hate me ;-;
easiest would be using VB
I'll think about it
7Ah.
You'll need to give me quite some time though
7That's fine.
I'm busy and I haven't programmed for months
I know that old versions of OSX get left behind fairly quickly. :(

12As for card scans, why not use the scans they have on Pokemon.com?
now for child abuse
12All you need to do is take a png screen shot of it XD
12Then crop
or
just learn how to copy image urls
:0
*:P
lol
Pop tarts commercial?
XD didnt see that coming
OMG PLANE
ouch
I'm never holding a balloon again
Lol.
Wow.
Raining kids.
I now feel fully justified for all the times I used balloons as punching bags.
the best part is that this was all drawn by hand, no computers until sound was added
6pokebeach?
12No, Pokemon.com
ballloons are mad
6no I mean
6try pokebeach
12Oh

EW COMPLAINING ABOUT STEALING STOLEN GOODS
i mean i have to leave for work in 6.5 hours
12articuno does it
12^
I know she does
7.5 hours here.
12then you just ewed her D:
and I keep telling her
As for part 3... good luck.
making it != copyrighting it
12the way i see it
technically TST site is not. actually copyrighted at all
12if i create something into this world
I'm going
12and someone wants to use it
12i feel honored
by the definition of copyrights
same
you finished it?
I just say
last page
yes
12it's only when they claim they made the piece of work
give credit where credit is due
hooray
12when i get irritated
^
that's plaigarism
entirely different
me*
etc
12Well, she did make a lot of the site
yes but
/me lies head down in computer lab... wakes up next day, suddenly tye-die hair
in order for something to be actually copyrighted
/me tents fingers "Excellent..."
you have to file paperwork for it
12Which you could not possibly do for TST xD
12ouuu
12wonderful show name
12pizza paradise
12lol
he is shipping me
GL, exactly
like everyone else on this site
to China?
but arti insists it's © anyway
hahahahahaha
... clever boy, but no. with anyting that moves
same with dA and saying "© 2011 artist"
99% of that is a complete lie

Silvermane reached over and nuzzled rainbow's cheek. He kissed her neck softly and listened to her slow, steady breathing. If he placed his ear to her chest, he could hear the steady rhythm her heart. He pulled back and looked into her eyes again. “Silver?” she said softly.
