Become obsessed with books instead.

You can read them when there is blackout.
08,01or Hitchhiker's Guide
08,01or Discworld
08,01or any of the millions of other great books there are out there
howabout manga?
Manga's good too. They're books
only type i willread
bad
Limiting yourself is bad
or dragons and wolves
Mangas are good, but are not the only good books out there.
08,01aniderp_downstairs: you're really missing out, then
^
does reading guidebooks count?
08,01aniderp_downstairs: well, have you read anything by Anne McCaffrey?
no?
Dragonriders!
oooo
08,01aniderp_downstairs: would you like me to buy you the first book in the series?
gotta go
/me 08,01likes spreading good stories
It's different, I guess it's not for all
And sometimes, it's nice to have the full scope of the scene without sludging through pages of descriptions before getting to the action.
*coughTOLKIENcough*
Hehe, I remember my friend telling me about novels like that
Great stories, but you have to understand a load of information to actually get it.
Having 3 pages of description explaining the cave, then having the characters simply travel through it
I made it a point to read through The Hobbit and all of Lord of the Rings before watching the Lord of the Rings movies. :>
=P
Spending half of the first chapter describing Bilbo's house, including a pause to talk about his obsession with maps, only for him to leave on an adventure and we don't see the house again until the very end of the story. :P
I already ordered my videocard too :3
t have enough patience to read the hobit history in the first Lord of the Rings book XD
accidently pressed enter before finishing
The Hobbit history? I was just talking about The Hobbit. :P
Uh oh
Why?
Haven't read the first page yet
Already horny too.
A friend wanted to read it but didn't have enough oney
but I'm just going to read it first then let her read it :P
money*
o.o
Why did I write him then her? .-.

08,01but it's a 17" with an i5 430
08,01*430m
08,01so it does everything i require of it
Oh yours is awesome, mine is dated. Its pretty much only good for watching videos and basic web browsing...
08,01worked pretty well

thx Saturn i must try them out
Quake was awesome
i lovw quake
Republicans are geniuses. Just now I heard that one republican moaned that the female teacher in that school did not have a gun in her desk
the muiltyplayer was fast and fun
08,01JRP2234: goldeneye was the 90s too
the n64?
I never played Goldeneye, but I heard awesome stories. :>
08,01also, Unreal was 90s
its an interesting topic
whether you play them or not
08,01there was also Blood, which was pretty good
08,01and, heh, of course, Daikatana
Saturn Loved it
08,01oh shit
Everytime I hear Daikatana I think JonTron XD
and the crappy N64 port
08,01it still terrifies the crap out of me
I was originally going to mount one of the fans on the outside. but than discovered it would be difficult with the way it is put together. I managed to cram it all into my antec p90 case but it was very tight
08,01anyhoos, taht's about all i can think of right now
awesome
how bout the 80s?
: D
I always have
Hai everypony
ALWAYS
/me shivers
especially if you messed up the key order
Even Half-Life had Underwater parts
Saturn How about the 80's?
Alma Most games of said time had that.
Gotta go. School. Bye guys
Ok good
Now to hit the hay
Goodnight everyone.
later on
How else could you achieve 33 million players with a Moba
Alma: yeah but my menu lags like crazy. and my machine is from 08...
old processor
you should be fine with that 60
08,01JRP2234: there weren't really any in the 80s
08,01maybe you could count Elite
2d games?
contra
but it was a side slider
08,01hmm
08,01work on this coursework presentation, or continue designing a CPU?
08,01the CPU is a hobby project, not coursework
refer to the slackers manual.
oh. it was never writen.
08,01well, technically, designing a processor is more work
08,01but it's not work i *need* to do
08,01so it's more attractive
08,01the_real_pony_1604: easy, but it won't have an x86 instruction set
hahah
do we really need that any more?
;)
08,01well, technically, i can just make it add and compare
guess whos back, back again!
I AM ALIVE!
08,01because of how slow it'd be

Saturn http://i.imgur.com/n7r0f.png
how does this work
08,01$15 per MB?
08,01fuck
but its a 15 gb plan
how does this work
Saturn, thats telstra for you
i had an 'unilimited' plan with them which magically became 20GB
dont...die...on...me! http://derpy.me/cpPRh
and i managed to pull 40GB through a connection that should have slowed to dialup speeds at 20
without noticing
telstra tried to charge us $3K
did you pay?
did you file a lawsuit?
did you throw bananas at them
that wouldnt have helped much but now i wish i did
its not my thigy
its another persons problem
Saturn, other services vary in quality, betwene 20c and $5 per MB of excess usage
$15 is unique to telstra
but 15
no one else is that stupid
wtf
they don't deserve any money
trhats it
telstra own most of the lines
Think*

hey, I was going to say that
:<
Oh, it's "tongue" by the way
bannable offence.
Common mistake :P
...
Fluttershy is such an unlikeable bitch
I dont think any of us have been following the rules
:'(
MY EYES
there are no rules.
but she does those little "squees" or "yays" and the whole fandom loves her
bullshit
exactly
7Except don't talk about spyrochat.
:'(
I dont have owner or anything because the network is messed up.
7That is the first rule of spyrochat
meh, i dont find her all that cute, altho cuteness is subjective
It is horrendous
...
05right?
05anyways
05sleep
It's like Purple meets 1998
7Stormy: hey I'm just saying you're layering it on thicker and thicker.
I'm pretty sure you're the only one seeing this
but whatever
then add myself to opers
because the oper list was wiped.
Am I the only one in a rage at the moment?
yep.
yep
SR you should still have oper
There's no way I still would if you didn't
we were oper'd at the same time
it's just a joke, no one wants to kick anyone out
at least judging from the title
there have been alot of dash eps this season
I want to kick something
yea
2 in a row
Preferably something kickable
why? o.o
Like a kickball
well rarity was in the week before last
Or a soccerball
brb
flim flam were pretty damn noticable
if its still there I cant remember it.
Ill keep trying passwords.
sprunkls
xD
and didnt restore it
this season needs a really good, winter wrap up level song
why would he do that?
upgrades?
can you oper?
yes
weird
I probably just forget my password.
maybe I could change it?
I don't know if that's something I am allowed to do
i dont think it would let you
During season 3 i mean
yeah
I think only the network owner can do that.
whos the network owner?
a teaser huh?
Also, http://steffy-beff.deviantart.com/art/Twilight-Stocking-Stuffer-343453781

Terrible Fate is an album dedicated to Zelda.

Yeah no this ain't an official entry
my guess
an album of remix
*at
you can see hes done more work like that
and how the countdown reach "the end of the world" in a non-professional way
yup
OOT and MA were epic
meh
nothing has met my expectations since then
the 3ds oot is an excellent port
all the bugs from the n64 are there
Yeah but Zelda seems to be getting more and more watered down
kinda like square not giving us ffvii hd
