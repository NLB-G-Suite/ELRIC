Batcave?
jk
That sounds boring lol
08,01Barbetos: classy

Shizucave
My mic was ready, but my recording software was not
Infact my burp bluescreened my other computer in the hall.
Seems normal to me
And cased my dog off
Also the front door is missing.
Oh no. Wiat. That was just my ex.
Dayum, Barbetos. What'd you drink?
Barbetos: it was the burp the legends spoke of! you are indeed the chosen one
oh
dat lab
That kind of burp just secured my after life in valhala

Or just stupid.
So, this guy came up to me and called me a Trigga
Mah trigga
was someone trying to talk to me
How many people are usually in a minecraft server?
08,01Barbetos: i'm not too worried; airflow on this laptop is terrible, so i just need to position it near a window or something
Minigolems!

:O minecraft

its Feed The Beast
Oh, that's a man-grunt
Eh. I did not mind the dub for FLCL
wow
but that was around the time that dubs sucked
:O tekkit yay
thats big
It's not Tekkit >:
FLCL was an excpetion if I remember correctly.
well this mod is part of tekkit though
well its the single player vers of tekkit also known as technic
oh
xD
derpy_h: both Tekkit and Feed the Beast are complilations of lots of different mods
Every time Shizuka shows us her Minecraft world, her creations get more and more amazing.
oh...
floof
DIAMONDS
pretty amazing
awwww
tried ftb last night its pretty neat espacialy the hydra but my friend couldent get on the server without crashing so yea
00,10nice strip mine
What the hell is lighting that place?
00,10is it doing the depth marks automaticly Shizuka
What happens when the it hits lava or water?
Barbetos: magic. *snort* *snort*
Drew: water does nothing, lava will stop it
whats the green things on your map
00,10it is un effected by liqueds
kk
welp, back to give FLCL another shot
cause why the fuck not
Shizuka: are you going to build a model EVA?
it will mine obsidian though, so flooding your quarry actually makes it go "through" lava in a sense
or shizumobile whoever gets pinged XD
i preffer combustion over redstone energy
This all reminds me of Dwarf Fort XD
Such a good game.
try nuclear power its fun but dangerous
ah fun buts
probably safer then combustion, unless it's be changed recently XD

Good old tweeky
Ooo so nice.
Mmm burgers.
/me ties otakon to a chair, clockwork orange style and makes him watch evangelion over and over again
So, this is from the Thaumacraft mod?
00,10that'ssssssssssss a niccccccce factory
Bronysith: jokes on you, I can't see shit without my glasses
would be a shame if it were...
Sumica: you know better than that she has no enemies in there
UNIONIZED
All that evangelion cures your vision I bet.
baCK
otakon: jokes on you, the tv screen is a prescription to your eyes specifically, and even then you will still here shinjis whining and screaming
that's so gaben
Roast beef
yes
NOT THE BABIES
burn them
Not the moo moos
TV screen prescription to someone's eyes? I don't think it works that way XD
make them pay for their wicked plots of dmonation
goodnight everyone :)
13see
13i breed the cows
COWS
13then i kill their parents in front of them
babbi cows!
13it makes them tougher
13and better leather
Shizuka: MURDERER!
00,10mars attacks
AttackWithHugs, these are livestock. The one thing you should never do with livestock is grow attached to them.
:D
SuperBrony64: LOOK AT WHAT SHIZU DOES!
anyone has that urging feeling of doing silly faces while looking into a mirror?
Shizuka: youve been watching too much evangelion
CrystalPhoenix: like Pinkie? nah
but what happens when you go too far and one of them becomes Cowman Shizuka?
lol, aw
:D
00,10SUPER COW
SUPER SHEEP
Or ManCow? That dude is a terrible DJ.
:P
Shizuka, so mental trauma strengthens their bodies?
otakon: im watching FLCL right now...what the fuck is going on?
missed an interesting conversation I see
otakon: is this supposed to be taken seriously?
"scat"?
Bronysith: I don't think so....
not really too interesting
Boring
dawwww
closenuff
Girl problems
otakon: You ever see Sword Arts Online?
I am still fiddiling around with Fruity Loops Studio
It's hard to use
FLCL makes complete sense you just have to watch it on mountains of DMT
that was mostly sarcasm :P
jcelios: so drugs?
what in the hell are those
good god
they move
yes
they float
I was late to read Shizuka explaining why she slaughtered the cows. Man, slaughtering them for their meat is normally neded for survival and market. But, making orphans out of the young? What the HECK!?
Bronysith: hay brah DMT is completely natural
jcelios: so drugs
Bronysith: fight the powah!
I never dated in high school so I wouldn't have been good for advice anyways
Er, orphans just to traumatize them, that's what bugs me.
ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH
god i love gurren lagann
so much that i need to get a kamina body pillow
hmm yess wicthes brew
and yoko
so that its not gay
Kawaii Desu desu
-_^
oh who am i kidding
Kamina is the sexiest thing ever
is it the glasses?
nope
The more I stare the less I understand.
the personality jcelios
shizu the potions masta
Why does this remind me of Runsescape?
personally, i think everyone needs a kamina in their life, someone to punch you
tell you to get over it and move on in your life
Yeah I have that.
suddenly the cow army comes
oh right gurren lagann is the one with spiral enery and robots the size of galaxies XD
and moos sihizuka too death
jcelios: 1% of the universe
I start to bitch and moan and he looks me right in the eyes, and starts whining obnoxiously
And it reminds me not to be so serious.
http://imgur.com/TLKKb everyone knows this needed to happen
Cause we a bunch of monkies on a organic space ship/
Good evening everypony :)
Hi NocturnalBlade :)
Night, NocturnalBlade
Hey Blade
Oooo cool, shizu stream ^_^
good evening NocturnalBlade
She took us on a tour of her magical minecraft world :)
Something smells like burning hair
Bronysith: It wouldn't have worked. Shinji is so damn broken that Kamina would walk away somewhat depressed and Simon would actually develop an early ego.
OH CRAP THATS MY ARM!
suddenly the cow army starts advancing on shizukas jome
/me hugs thelonepony and noms hims...gives additional hugs to AttackWithHugs ThunderBlaze and texasboykc09
Thsi is her home?

... is there maybe a way i might be able to do a livestream?
ThunderBlaze: nope
no
nope
never
Darn
only mods
08,01what's EoE?
Strictly Mods only. Very strictly.
called it
It might be impossible to ask but is there maybe some Mod applications?
08,01surely, it can' tbe that bad?
otakon: AKA 2 hour metaphor for masturbation
I was actually an admin for a TF2 server
it is that bad
Yumozfuntastic server
Bronysith: with REALLY REALLY drawn out animation shots of them doing NOTHING
08,01ThunderBlaze: we're not currently looking, but e-mail us an application anyway
Bronysith: I thought it was a metaphor for the russian revolution
derpy_h: it's all over the place in terms of quality really
otakon: still quite an experience
ThunderBlaze: modding bronystate is VERY different than modding a TF2 server
IT maybe is but i am willing to learn
otakon: cause it being gainax, the animation, is actually good at some key parts
Derpy_Hooves: for one, no massive Sasha to put people in their place
Bronysith: exactly
IS ther anyone doing another stream or is this it for now?
otakon: wut?
ThunderBlaze: for now
honestly I don't like NGE for how goddamn depressing it is in general
otakon: cause even if you hate NGE, you cant deny it has great animation moments
yeah it does
much to my chagrin
Cause well...Gainax
chugging the last of my stein, then off to bed - Cheers Everyone
HOWEVER! GL tops them

Shizuka: you banned him?
13eeyup
haha, I'll just plug in my phone and leave it on all night... :P
Thank you
I honestly hate stubborn ignorant people like that
I always love how people always commonly think they know what trolling is and they are being funny for it. Except what they are doing is only being douchebags
please stop it, yore givin' me diabetus
wonderful.
Shizuka: Can I post a gif of his reaction to the banning? I got told gifs wern;t allowed :\
$0.03 a minute
is what I get charged haha

cheap for you, charge clients a lot though :P
its all custom and easy.

bracnh prediction?

http://d34dh0r5.tumblr.com/post/38195755134/discord That's what he was probably thinking
meh... not really... he's not nearly on the same troll level as Discord
XXD maybe
I will let you know one thing
I am still a beginner at php
If you guys maybe wondering
but that'd be cool
I am good at 2 things
13trolls are uncreative sad creatures
ThunderBlaze: i wasnt wondering
DiscSlash: Behold! Candence http://derpiboo.ru/185721
it is really actually not complex code.
nice music btw :P
using Knifes... and Counter Trolling
thx
Shizuka: minus dari
whose voice was that :P
13they're incapable of producing anything for themselves so instead they deride what other people produce
all of my lols
XD nice
i was hoping counter-striking
Well i am good at getting rid of trolls
13trolls just want attention
So far... got rid of 7 so far
Shizuka: Its sad really
ThunderBlaze: COOL SOTRY
They try too hard
13it's disgraceful
Shizuka: who big is your log on trolls
of course
http://derpiboo.ru/images/186204 i dont like this too much because r63, but that last panel made me lol
THAT MUST BE HIGH ON THE CREDENTIAL LIST
Yeah he got banned for it
Trolling is not being a douche and just making insults and offensive jokes
XD
08,01Shizuka: http://du.cx/files/CS4202_P1___Report.pdf
Trolling is actually being comedically funny
Making people laugh
lol freebird was waiting for like 20 minutes to continue playing
13no that's comedy
skynyrd has didication
Shizuka: i would suggest not making your disspaointment visable. It seems thats what every troll on here wants from you
dedication*
13trolling is irritating other people for nothing more than your own enjoyment
the yellow car knows no mercy
08,01i've become somewhat renowned in the e CS department here for using Mandelbrot fractals in examples
13oo look shizu so mad, wait what's the big hammer for
08,01a lot.
why you guys are talking about trolls, lets forget that and have fun
The other definition of troll is a giant cave creature
Shizuka: Its BAN TIME!
13that turns to stone in daylight
No shizu no!
13see
Shizuka: they still leave with the satisfaction
13trolls never go outside
lol
is it a good troll, or a newb wannabe troll? :)
13because they would turn to stone
woah
13so they just stay in their mom's basement
troll is also a tiny bridge creatue
i believe you can fly~

I won't understand it but i'll almost learn somethign from it!
08,01Kurra: it's just a practical for my course

08,01if someone stole it, it'd be flagged up on turnitin

I'd do the same if I didn't have to take notes on "Science and Theology: An Introduction" by John Polkinghorne
13he's ugly but he's pretty too
13nahmean

he is wise, yet he is foolish
Polkinghorne references himself in the third person a lot, it's really weird

OMG
AM I HEARING THAT!?

dig the custom tracks
No!!! The tunes! The tunes are gone! :'(
i know guy a who knows phelps personally
13in that segment, the buddha is holding a cameraphone, nahmean?
00,02how would you pronounce nahmean
dat turret song
nah meen?
im just guessin
13Phase4: well you say it with a bit of a slur, but not too much twang nahmena?
00,02when guns are easier to work than a camera, either something is very right or very wrong
yeah, gut kinda no. nahmean?
Phase4 well guns are just point and shoot, cameras can't do that
*but
this the movie version or the TV version of ROD?
00,02Shizuka, doesnt look right to me, though hn is dificult to pronounce anyway
00,02dat zoom
00,02if that was a real camera those guys would be grey bloobs merged into other grey bloobs
well that was easy
13Phase4: it's a corruption of "know what i mean", where "know what i" collapses into "nah"
13it's more like nah-ih-mean
00,02 o_O
yay, done

Shizuka the real question is why no one links the actual pic instead of the google search
^
well its hard to see how big a link because you only see the limited url bar size
well with that embarrasment im off to bed, again sorry

Isn't streaming like, really taxing on your pc?
Hello, BronyState
Haio KrazyNoobs
ohai KrazyNoobs
hallo KrazyNoobs
thats a nice payday
I wonder why absolutely NO information about Season 3 Episode 8 has been released
5* current finances
KrazyNoobs no spoilers
its an instant ban
Ok guys, i shall go hit the hay...good night, thanks for the stream Sumica and see yall later :)
!cd
Episode 8 of season 3 "Apple Family Reunion" airs in 4 days, 7 hours, 40 minutes, 46 seconds (Dec 22 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
It isnt a spoiler. Saying that there are no spoilers isn't a spoiler in itself
i swear
i keep adding tom to ignore
and he keeps coming through
NocturnalBlade night
damnit
I don't think admins could be ignored... you wouldn't want to do that anyway, as about 80% of what most of them say is important.
im fed up of title spoilers from tom
13yay two cop cars now
collect all the cop cars!
iv had more spoilers from tom than anything else
Chrysalis: Isn't it a little hardcore to keep yourself from seeing the ACTUAL title of the episode?
KrazyNoobs i like it to be as much as a supprise as possible
but yes i even try to avoid the titles
Ah, then you should be happy, as we don't even know the title of the new episode...
Chrysalis: you mean the episode names?
Pinkies4thWall same thing
Yeah, that is a bummer finding out names to me
First time playing, Sumi?
/me needs cider
NAO
Just curious what your decision at the end was, money or vengeance. :$

hmm, is that bug still there which let non mods use colours?
or did you all get it fixed now
right its been fixed
Sumica: did you switch your pings? And because you are screwy with the little green guys. that's why
Ah.
At least it's light...
but not too aerodynamic
Howdy everypony
Haio Moopy
Hi Moopy
hi
I just ate 100 slices of pepperoni...
Spaaaaaaaace!
I feel kinda weird
There is no air in space, meaning no wind resistance, meaning no use for aerodynamic design once it is up there.
it's a miracle?
KrazyNoobs: yes there is
It looks cool
hello?
hello
Pinkies4thWall: and you're not sick?
so whos streaming cause i see a bunch of pony pictures showing up on my screen here
pony_7777: i might be later
:D
BRING THE PAIN
ok it said i was disconnected for some reason
that was easy... Good job!
Pinkies4thWall: thats future Pinkies4thWall's problem?:P
Moopy: It should be Sumice playing Kerbal
EXACTLY
Sumica* how do I keyboard
oh ok hang on i need to refresh the stream screen here hold on a second
lol looking at mortal kombat 9 babality videos *squee*
twilight_sprinkle: I hope i feel okay...
Oh there we go now i see the stream now
/me pokes Moopy
Ouch that hurts dude
Pinkies4thWall: you probably wont if you actually ate 100 pieces. start preparing now, eat stuff to prevent stomach pain
TO THE CIDER!!!
Pinkies4thWall: but not random kind of stuff of course
Cider is never random
Because PONIES
So i herd that in minecraft that you can make a TNT canon right?
i heard that too.
i think its really easy to build i guess

Hey hold on a minute here im going to try to build a TNT canon in minecraft real quick but just 1 question: Can i use the obsidian to build a TNT canon as well?
lol
but what if they have mondays in hell
13yes but the TNT itself should be in a water flow block
13obsidian is resistant, the redstone you'll use to detonate it is not
Cool thanks Shizuka
?
ksp is epic
Cause i build so many things in minecraft here in my world
/me fetches his $5 cider
wait i need to finish making the world's biggest bed in minecraft here first
What is this game called again?
kerbal space program
k, thanks
I pay $5 for less than a gallon of cider
This is good shit
Shizuka: hi
I need to redownload KSP
Are there any "goals" in this game? (besides 'model a spacecraft that successfully flies into space'?)
KrazyNoobs: nope
Ah, okay\
That makes it ever better
just build ships n stuff
My goal is always to waste taxes of the common kerbal
KrazyNoobs, the goal is to find the most creative method possible to murder the whole Kerbal race
and goodnight Shizuschlafen :P
AdamTheDuck: From what I have seen so far, seems legit. LOL

Dat slow loading :D
djblazekin, we're on Woodman server and playing witht he NC
my pc can run it on low everything smoothly
djblasekin : Slow pc maybe?
nah i have an athlon x2 5000+ and a geforce 6150
o3e
2gb ddr2 ram
djbazekin : i5-750 4ghz oc, gtx xfx 260 50%oc :D
so i need an i5 or higher

11,02oi
what would you recomend i only have $100 for entertainment
11,02i liek nintendo /)^3^(\
/me is shocked
Just found the best video ever. Too bad I can't link it atm :P
i dont do mutch pc gaming i'm mostly on consoles
WiiU is awesome.
wii u was a flop
Nope.
yeo
djblazekin : If you play on consoles, you really dont need a better graphics card :D
since this is by soe then i'll wait for a ps3 release
11,02DemoPegono: IKR O3O
sup guys. What is this game?
planetside 2
For me, it actually did what the PS3 and XBox 360 could not do.
There's even Batman: Arkham City in the WiiU.
Bye ^
^^
technicly if you have a vita you can do a tabletesc wiiu like expierence on ps3
is this a pc exclusive @wreck
But does it have a bigger screen? Enough to actually NOT force your eyes out?
the wii u could
Heck, WiiU gives a touchpad screen, PERFECT for games like Scriibblenauts.
i think a wiiu release of this on eshop would be great
/me shrugs
the touchpad would have the map
If you want to use the touch screen of the WiiU in an awesome way, then play it with that new Lego detective game.
or batman
Yuss.
And now I know why they made the screen so big... just for those awesome faetures.
madden choose ur plays on the screen
draw new routs
YES! i got the TNT cannon to work in minecraft hell i did it finaly it worked holy shit ha ha ha whoooooo!

Gold_Demona: on this particular occasion the prof redefined macromolecules in such a way that if I told that definition on another exam they would have failed me instantly.
Oh boy

So End of Ponies will finally continue after this intermission for the author
And let me plaaay among the staaars!~
Gold_Demona: classy music :3
Frank Sinatra for the win, baby! =D
Though personally I prefer Bing Crosby. =/
Gold_Demona: Oooh, my grandpa loved Bing Crosby, even if he always mispronounced his name :D
lol, How did he pronounce it? XD
Gold_Demona: actually I think he got him right, but dude couldn't get any other name right :D And my grandma thought Starsky and Hutch were "Hurky and Stursky" :D
lol :D
Pronounced Hoorkie and Stoorskie, mind you
lol yeah XD

08,01my love for her was like francium-215
lol
08,01basic, volatile, and short-lived.
Gold_Demona: and the male rival from B/W became the first gym leader :O
MadSurge: Eeyup
Gold_Demona: I still don't get the hate the female rival gets :|
She's just kinda dumb, and people have a tendency to hate characters that are kinda dumb and exaggerate the crap out of her dumbness. :P
08,01i want to watch some gargoyles now
08,01and it's your fault, Gold_Demona
Gold_Demona: but... that's not enough to hate her...
MadSurge: It is for some people.
08,01man, goliath is sexy
08,01i would like to have Keith David's voice's babies
08,01i'm not sure who i like better, goliath or lexington
08,01i'd certainly tap both
Gold_Demona: yeah, let's hate on the dorky ditz and let's adore the genocidal pretty silver haired boy. FANDOMS!
08,01indeed
MadSurge: Eeyup
08,01he's also tiny, which is adorable
Yes he is. ^^

Wait, how is aniderp_downstairs talking to us without her laptop?

im depressed
;~; So I buy my niece a crystal pony version of Rainbow Dash that comes with a crystal Tank
08,01# when i was 25 i was a rock star, but it didn't pay too well i had to strip on the side, of the road to get ready for shows and the cars driving by, baby they'd never know, what a bargain they'd gotten #
and she throws away Rainbow Dash and plays with Tank ;~;
D:
LOL Oh geez
did you take the dash?
and now my brother is giving me strange looks for buying myself Rarity and Lyra XD
Ello there everybrony.
Hiyo Malavolent

Reporting live from school.

AdamTheDuck: It's k, it's literature class.
Just cuddle this Wrekpony plushie every time you feel the need to go on BronyState aniderp_downstairs
/me hands aniderp_downstairs a plush Wrekpony

aniderp_downstairs: Taking a break from it would help. And by that I don't mean go to work.
Oh Jmo, you so silleh.
how i be deprresedand sleepyill i get it back/
wut?
thast work?
stupidkeyboard
wrek im downloading ps2
No, being depressed and gloomy isn't going to do anything for you. In fact, it will have the opposite effect. It will just make things worse.
Pfft lighten up Jmo, you're always so tight :P
not to be confused with ps2 playstation 2
There is a time and place. Learn it.
JRP2234: Thanks for clarifying that.

Wow, are you even serious?
It's a machine, not a puppy
You really need help.
eletronics are mylife
;_;
08,01aniderp_downstairs: what a shallow life, then. read a book
^
Become obsessed with books instead.
08,01seriously, get yourself a copy of Illium by Dan Simmons
^
You can read them when there is blackout.
08,01or Hitchhiker's Guide
08,01or Discworld
08,01or any of the millions of other great books there are out there
Try Angels and Demons by Dan Brown
howabout manga?
08,01read an Oscar Wilde play
Manga's good too. They're books
08,01seriously, Oscar Wilde is hilarious
aniderp_downstairs: Don't.
only type i willread
bad
Limiting yourself is bad
Malavolent, nothing wrong with manga .-.
or dragons and wolves
Mangas are good, but are not the only good books out there.
08,01aniderp_downstairs: you're really missing out, then
^
AdamTheDuck: I prefer ordinary books to mangas.
iread dragon book
does reading guidebooks count?
Malavolent, and I too also prefer a good old novel from time to time, but there is nothing wrong with manga.
I've read one manga in my whole life because the anime wasn't finished.
08,01aniderp_downstairs: well, have you read anything by Anne McCaffrey?
no?
Ann McCaffrey's books are awesome
Dragonriders!
People who ride frickin dragons!
oooo
AdamTheDuck: I don't say manga is bad, but you don't have to use your imagination at all.
Malavolent: So?
08,01aniderp_downstairs: would you like me to buy you the first book in the series?
gotta go
08,01pm me your address and i will
Gold_Demona: The best thing about books is that you can create the whole world in your imagination.
Bye aniderp_downstairs
/me 08,01likes spreading good stories
Malavolent: Yes, but that's a whole other animal from comics, though. The point of reading a manga is more for the visual experience.
Malavolent, and illustrations help
It's different, I guess it's not for all
Gold_Demona: I agree, but I don't know, manga has never given me any feels at all.
And sometimes, it's nice to have the full scope of the scene without sludging through pages of descriptions before getting to the action.
*coughTOLKIENcough*
Hehe, I remember my friend telling me about novels like that
Gold_Demona: British books in general, I'd say.
Great stories, but you have to understand a load of information to actually get it.
Having 3 pages of description explaining the cave, then having the characters simply travel through it
I made it a point to read through The Hobbit and all of Lord of the Rings before watching the Lord of the Rings movies. :>
Ohai oni_link
What server did everyone end up getting on?
Barbetos, Woodman
sounds made up
=P
Spending half of the first chapter describing Bilbo's house, including a pause to talk about his obsession with maps, only for him to leave on an adventure and we don't see the house again until the very end of the story. :P
Can't wait to get on this game. Get paid in two days and I can finally get my tower
Gold_Demona, uhh I didn'
I already ordered my videocard too :3
t have enough patience to read the hobit history in the first Lord of the Rings book XD
accidently pressed enter before finishing
The Hobbit history? I was just talking about The Hobbit. :P
So... I just bought myself 50 Shades of Grey...
Uh oh
Why?
Haven't read the first page yet
Already horny too.
A friend wanted to read it but didn't have enough oney
so I bought it and was going to let him read it
but I'm just going to read it first then let her read it :P
money*
o.o
Why did I write him then her? .-.
lol
Uhh I think I should probably get some shut eye
Go to bread, Ducky
lol
The little Sumi that could?
Looks soo fun
Its vertical by the way
You know, Meaanwhile actually sounds angry all the time XD
hah
this game looks very prety
I know right Phase4 ?
Phase4, too bad it is very unoptimised
AdamTheDuck, most games are
ooh I should probably try and get KSP running on my PC ;~;
What did you PM me when I was shutting off my PC at 02:00 in the morning Phase4? :$
Can anyone help me out in choosing a good cooling solution for a kit I'm buying?
AdamTheDuck, i pm'd you?
Not sure, I was too sleepy to check
Or was it 4 am?
2 hour eta on my download of this game :(
Oh cool Hexchat keeps logs
Phase4, it looks like its worth it at least :)
Go to sleep already you twat.
Mojay y u so mean? D:
Uhh, I'll sleep later Jmo :P
Trying to get KSP running
Jmo, you sleep
It's 2038
I slept for 5 hours previously.
how much is a cheap but decent liquid cooler gonna cost me?

road trip!
the one I have, the H80 is around 90 bucks depending on where you get it
the_real_pony_1604 from nowhere
been here all along. ;)
the_real_pony_1604: where did you get yours?

Phase4 goto bed
NO :<
JRP2234, go to bread
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1355829113057.gif
ah alright I was looking at this one, don't know if it was any good the_real_pony_1604 http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=7335485&CatId=499
it was on sale at the time but looks to be a little more now, oni_lin
it would work, I looked at it when I was shopping. but wanted the dual fan control of the H80
my only recommendation is make for SURE you have room for it. I had to take the heat sync off one of my ram sticks to fit it
how many people are there in this game?
you should join them Phase, they have been having problems
Phase4, a couple hundred a server
clearly a man with 280 ping is what they need :P
Phase4, pfft, ping isn't a big deal, everyone lags so it's even :P
i hadrly blame them, have you seen what it costs to host servers here?
its absurd
Did stream die?
nope
i paid $50 to get a vps for a year in the US
to get anywhere near the power that vps has i'd need to pay twice that a month
here in aus i meen
Yeesh
no, what is absurd is Google has a facility in Oklahoma that is a full one for one backup of their main server farm. it has never been activated and is only maned by 6 people to clean the floors and blow dust out
i have no idea why they charge so much
the_real_pony_1604, imagine if google actually goes down though
they cant afford that
though i'd imagine the facility is doing something
you don't hold that many servers offline, no point
mornin' all :>

from what I have been told by people that live in the area it hasn't. but I do understand why it is there

oni_link, I have a 3930k. have had no problems yet with it. and I can definitely tell when it kicks in the fans for added cooling.
the_real_pony_1604: guess Ill go with it just to be safe
sounds like it doesnt hurt to have that dual just in case
08,01i'im thinking of getting one of the 2nd generation core i chips
08,01but the only reason really is that i want to play around with the new AVX instructions
well, like I said, make for SURE you have room for it. I have a very large case and it was an extremely tight fit
in the very least, I know its the same socket
lol
08,01oni_link: not bad
/me 08,01pretty much only uses a laptop now
Im happy, I can finally get off this laptop and do some real gaming :3
08,01but it's a 17" with an i5 430
08,01*430m
08,01and a gtx330 graphics chip
08,01so it does everything i require of it
Oh yours is awesome, mine is dated. Its pretty much only good for watching videos and basic web browsing...
small hard drive, older graphics solution etc
08,01i was playing Portal 2 in Linux using Wine the other day
08,01worked pretty well
nice :)
08,01JRP2234: witchaven, shadowcaster

I LOVED shadowcaster back in the day

08,01JRP2234: goldeneye was the 90s too
the n64?
08,01oh oh! star wars: dark forces!
I never played Goldeneye, but I heard awesome stories. :>
08,01also, Unreal was 90s
08,01and so was Half-Life
tbh the_real_pony_1604 , I dont think that H80 is gonna fit
08,01for someone who doesn't play games, i know surprisingly much about them...
I think Im better of with the H60
its an interesting topic
whether you play them or not
08,01i think Perfect Dark was just teetering on being 90s
yeah, very late 90s
the 90's were the golden age of fpsa
08,01there was also Blood, which was pretty good
08,01and, heh, of course, Daikatana
08,01oh shit
Everytime I hear Daikatana I think JonTron XD
08,01how could i forget System Shock?
and the crappy N64 port
08,01that was a fucking scary game
08,01it still terrifies the crap out of me
I was originally going to mount one of the fans on the outside. but than discovered it would be difficult with the way it is put together. I managed to cram it all into my antec p90 case but it was very tight
08,01anyhoos, taht's about all i can think of right now
awesome
how bout the 80s?
I know for a fact the H60 will fit but I don't want to risk not having the H80 not fit you know?
Yay it runs Phase4 \:3/
: D
Nothing is scarier than a water level ... in any game
I hate water levels
And all of these jump n run games had a water level
I always have
Ocarina of Time, Banjo Kazooie, Super Mario 64...
Hai everypony
ALWAYS
/me shivers
oot was agreat game
Water Temple in OOT and MM were a bitch
especially if you messed up the key order
Even Half-Life had Underwater parts
Alma Most games of said time had that.
Gotta go. School. Bye guys
I wanna hear some C64 history :3
bye Ponies47
Bye Ponies47
Bye Ponies47 ~
Oh wow, C64 :D
Wait, what is the latest version Phase4?
AdamTheDuck, 0.18.1
Ok good
understandable, oni_link. what CPU are you using and do you plan any over clock?
Now to hit the hay
Goodnight everyone.
later on
oni_link: Man, Valve is specifically creating their games to run on the shittiest systems
How else could you achieve 33 million players with a Moba
the_real_pony_1604: I want to eventually start overclocking and im getting an i5-2500K @3.30GHz
Alma: yeah but my menu lags like crazy. and my machine is from 08...
old processor
you should be fine with that 60
I thought so , thanks for the help :)
and good call getting a sandy bridge. cheaper and I don't know if intel has fixed the ivy bridge heating problems or not
Yeah, I'd rather work with something I know works than to hope it will
thats why I got the 3930k when I built my computer a couple months back vs. waiting for the ivy bridge-e to come out. the heating problems with the ivy bridge cpus freaked me out a bit
08,01JRP2234: there weren't really any in the 80s
08,01maybe you could count Elite
2d games?
08,01though that was more a space shooter
contra
but it was a side slider
08,01hmm
08,01work on this coursework presentation, or continue designing a CPU?
08,01the CPU is a hobby project, not coursework
/me 08,01is teaching himself Verilog
refer to the slackers manual.
oh. it was never writen.
08,01well, technically, designing a processor is more work
08,01but it's not work i *need* to do
design a CPU that can be bought for 50 bucks, is naturally 3ghz, can be over clocked to 5, and is 8 core.
What he playing?
08,01so it's more attractive
08,01the_real_pony_1604: easy, but it won't have an x86 instruction set
hahah
do we really need that any more?
;)
08,01well, technically, i can just make it add and compare
guess whos back, back again!
08,01it'sll sitll be turing complete, and will fulfil all your requirements stated above
I AM ALIVE!
08,01it'll just be fucking useless
08,01because of how slow it'd be

how does this work
JRP2234, telstra
08,01$15 per MB?
08,01fuck
but its a 15 gb plan
how does this work
i had an 'unilimited' plan with them which magically became 20GB
dont...die...on...me! http://derpy.me/cpPRh
and i managed to pull 40GB through a connection that should have slowed to dialup speeds at 20
without noticing
im begging my mum to use someone better
telstra tried to charge us $3K
did you pay?
nope
did you file a lawsuit?
nope
did you throw bananas at them
that wouldnt have helped much but now i wish i did
JRP2234, notice the drop down box that says hsdpa, try change that
its not my thigy
its another persons problem
$15 is unique to telstra
but 15
no one else is that stupid
wtf
JRP2234, just cancle the service and refuse to pay
they don't deserve any money
shit company, shit staff, shit suport, shit connections and they charge everyone through the nose for bandwidth
trhats it
im getting ma own internet
this made sense when they had a monopoly on internet access
telstra own most of the lines
This I'm gonna play some ACIII MP on the XBox. Or MW3.

05its the... 4th episode iirc
Weird...his voice is different....
Vordox: No, the pilot is the one with the Space Chicken...
Or perhaps "Not found the right voice yet"
^
Pinkie pie wants to hug all of you, and the picture is how you do it. Seeing the picture = getting hugged.
like RD and Twi
i dont need a book... i have a dragon one in my duffle

Vordox: the pilot episode is the one with the CHICKEN FROM OUTER SPACE
Cyclone_Dusk: it's pretty good

Where's this song from? It's familiar
Megas :3
Oh, this is also from Megas?
dat loop
Kandarihu: yup.
requesting Evil Genius soundtrack
favorite part about megas? how Jersey and or a civilization is in ruins after fights
Zeus: yet New Jersey is always back up after that
Zeus: mine is when they always destroy PoP TV
or the randomly named buttons
I like the Arson, Murder, Jaywalking speeches
Good morrow.
Meanwhile \:3/
Well, this certainly is a dramatic still image.
hello good sir
Kandarihu: This is my planet, and nobody will destroy it.....except for me

Wow, PS2 is already grinding my gears. Gotta change my password even though I JUST registered. -.-
CountDoofus: PS2?

Well until you've been killed by a rocket pod.
Man, is this ALSO from the MEGAS OST? I can't believe I never noticed such a gem!
Oh, terribly sorry
I'm trying to clean my laptop's keyboard
lol what?

http://darkspyro.net/news/68176/
this is interesting news, for those who own playstations that is
Well that's swell. Can't even change my password because somehow my original one isn't reconized. Nice first impression... Sony?! :O
CountDoofus: well it is Sony
CountDoofus, is there a security question?
Kandarihu: Nope. There's a 'recover password' option, but that works only once every 24 hours. And apparently, I've already used that, even though I didn't.
So, screw it :p
sounds like your account got comprised
Lali-ho y'all, geez, it's been awhile, dang modem
how's it been?
Kandarihu: what you talking bout fool?

I love this ep

You DID Meanwhile? How?
Meanwhile: I wouldn't have minded it if my brother didn't have EVERY FUCKING THING from them, and I think he did that to annoy me.
Well, Power Rangers is basically it's own thing that uses footage from a Japanese Tokusatsu series which I probably would've enjoyed better.
YESSSSSSSS. another kickass theme
LadyCanary: Planks. Funnily enough.
Meanwhile: nice
Metronome: becuase CN is an insane child
Metronome not canceled, just not brought back for another season
Metronome: Low ratings or views...
but still, sad ;_;
YOU DONT SAY Meanwhile. But how did you get it working
Metronome: I know, it's sad, but the show's got a good run.
This = lowviews??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

...
OH COME ON
fair*
How many REFERENCES does this show HAVE?!
MORE KICKASS
Zeus I'm in the same boat as you man ;_;
Vordox: About a googolplex's worth
Vordox, it's built on pop culture references.
Fl00t4sh41: .... Damn. :P
Kandarihu: Err Galaxy Express isn't Pop Culture...
Ever
Deacon: dis global warming
dat episode title
Oh...
Vordox, it is to a lot of anime fans.
not the chrome!
Kandarihu: i think it's more that the creators was fans of the old stuff themselves. :p
O____O
fucking noob tube
i ahte them
SMACH DOWNNN OH SEIT
Vordox, Galaxy Express 999 and Captain Harlock were what Leiji Matsumoto's career were built off of. And it IS iconic in Japan.
Mazinger Z
Kandarihu: And this show is made in Japan? :P
:p
Snow wookies?
Fl00t4sh41, please no
Vordox, no, but obviously the makers of this show were into western otaku culture.
Kencolt: <--- Dat design reminds me of the Beast Kin from FF10.
-3-
Mega tron
Megatron?
Apparently Coop's voice actor is Dom DeLuise's son
Kandarihu: Western Otaku? USA has otakus? :P
Megatron?
MEGATRON!?
id say hes more of a starscream
Vordox: They're called Weaboos over here, but yes
isnt it moe of a moon?
nice
Not even a brain freeze
Kandarihu: Clearly fans. :D But that's just great. Happy to see references becoming new references
Well would you look at that! You're right Sugar_Flanks!
Word of the Day: Cereology - The study of Crop Circles.
there's a Halo episod of this too right?
iirc, I think
oh look, upside down galaxies
Decepticons beeyatch!!!
hi Afflict
Zeus, there's an episode that takes place on an artificial ring-world of sorts. But it's not a weapon, just a library.
yes
piss on it
the halo was a library
Kandarihu: still nerdgasmed when i saw it
Where's the WD40 when you need it?
wd40 is oil
Kandarihu: That ones a Ringworld reference I think
And aliens
Fl00t4sh41, I see. Okay.
welp
and a few other sci fi stories
sheeeitttt
and not a single drop of blood
PAWNC?H!
LOL
Kandarihu: Halo basically stole most of their universe from ringworld
......
Your instinct sucks.
Button apply directly to the forehead
sup
Dat City Quota
You're doing it wrong!
Well done Coop. You did a thing
only in ringworld, the ringworld is a bit bigger
Dominos!!
Dawn
of course he'd fuck it up
Fl00t4sh41: bunch of Halo lore is an extension from Marathon also
Fl00t4sh41: NO Halo is original all the way
about to try playing skylanders giants in a bit
city destroyed quota fulfilled
has around 300.000.000 times that of earth
Why does the robot have teeth?
05halo would have the same lore as marathon
05had it not been for "oh new IP"
05but its ehaviyl absed of it
Wut
05and i cant wait for the new marathon game they announced
Zeus: Even the ancients who where wiped out but who happen to be the ancestors of humanity?
no Durandel = sad pony :(
Wrek: English please?
And the rings
and all the other bits
Wrek: English motherfucker, do you speak it?!
>_>
or not
Saved! Doomed! Make your mind up.
hey
Doomed
brb guys
Fl00t4sh41: i was kiddin but I dont know what marathon is though
Wrek: you are like the only other Marathon fan I've ever met :)
Meanwhile: It's basically the same thing, right?
Fl00t4sh41: Eh? What?
Robot teeth
Sugar_Flanks: Robots got to chew their food too
Yes
oh my god this show!
I REMEMBER THIS SHIT!
allo ThunderBlaze
Mega tron!
<--- Loving the music
Deacon: Sup
hey ThunderBlaze
soundwave
Why don't the robots just grab a section of empty wilderness instead of the one place theres locals who will fight back?
how are things ThunderBlaze
Going alright
Fl00t4sh41: cuz they evil
Fl00t4sh41, because they're not fighting over empty wilderness.
Fl00t4sh41: they want the whole planet eventually, so they need to fight them
I was going to play L4d 2 but i wanted to join this for a while
Kewp.
Fl00t4sh41: That's how colonialism works
Just seems like its needlessly provokative towards the locals
well they are evil
Zeus: RAGGH WERE EVIL!
lolcats
Find new land > Slay the locals > Take the land > Repeat
Home RUN!!
SirGanjalf: oh look, humans
ThunderBlaze: suddenly mermaid man comes to mnd
They make it almost impossible to take out everything without destroying the packaging :/
Just seems like a massively ineffecient way to get water for the supposedly logical AI's in the robots
Zeus: EVIIIIIILLLLLLL

Dark92Enigma: ill def look that up I always loved the mermaid man eps

Zeus: looked it up, not on youtube anymore
Only had to doom the entire local biosphere to do it

crazy cat lady 2.0
Okay, I like cats but my limit is two.
<--- Penn and Teller...if you say what you THINK you will....
I have 4 cats but I couldn't imagine having that many...
typical Crazy Cat Lady™
I don't know how many my neighbor has.

05but yeah

Shizuka: depends on how the cat is raised
all they do is be fluffy
Shizuka: if they like you, they will bring you poresents. ours always tries to give us field mice
Cats don't feel like they have to pander to you.
*i don't mind cat people, as long as they can control the situation
they're luckily dead... most of the time
the life of a cat is sleeping, eating and getting whatever they want from humans

Shizuka: The art of the dance
;)
Bronysith in other words, the cats are the true masters in the relationship

You know how many f'cking dumb things we created from stupid breeding?
i want a dragon as a pet
Tortoise.
alexxm|colt: that was actually hilarious though XD
wrek you has now a new watcher
AssaultWithEmbraces: isnt that an amphipian?
no i mean a real fucking dragon
Bronysith: Give it about 120 years and then we have dragons
Some time before my first cat adopted me, I took care of a friend's two pet Iguanas. They were nice to see.
Bronysith: Is it really ethically sound to keep a sentient being as a pet?
BladedWings: No. Turtles are reptiles.....iirc
Vordox: i want to be a dragon rider XD
soo they record enthusiasts and shit on them later wow really cool show
Fl00t4sh41: yes
Bronysith: No worries about slavery or anything?

I think I need an adult....

Bronysith: Because the "starwars as fantasy" books are canon on dragons

The nice thing about having an external client is that I can pull it over the stream, for times like this.

Angelpaws wants to go home and sleep on the sofa. ¬¬
because yeah, cancer cures and dog testicle implants are totall the same thing
CriticKitten, my mother's sick from work because one of the schools that she's been to had a flu outbreak. And she just skipped out on another client from ANOTHER flu-stricken school.
D'awww kittys :3

Wrek: <.<

Meanwhile: I think the same of people who put clothes on their pets.
Meanwhile: I know right...
Kandarihu: Aye, we really need to find a way to vaccinate properly against the flu. The current one doesn't always do it.
Zeus: i dont feel better
Dark_Horst, because you don't want them to get lost.
woah, that's a huge pussy
...that doesn't sounded right
Dat cat
yes
/me slaps SirGanjalf
...or in a fight with other cats.
artist: that just means your good person
poor kitties
Kandarihu: the solution for that would be simply to not dress your cat up and put it in a cage in a great hall
Zeus: im not a good person either,,,,
<--- Bonita is good. <3

.....I think it's best that I don't talk for the rest of the day.

Shizuka: Labs are so cuddlesome =3
I like her.
05Shizuka: prefer german shepherds
AssaultWithEmbraces: It's fine, your opinion
05but goldies are nice too
Wrek: No way, Schäfer > all
Huskies uber alles.
05a friend of mien has a black lab
People=shit
AssaultWithEmbraces, she takes good care of her cats. But the vets who give my cats shots use alcohol wipes.
05Vordox: germans shepherd=schäfer silly
13black lab husky is a good combo too
Husky are fun
dat bragin
Wrek: What...? XD
Shizuka: THIS IS MY LAB! (wow wow) AND THIS IS MY LABORATORY......did i introduced you to my jambox?
Houdini's own bondage gear?
Wrek: But....

Wut
Sticky is best stick insect.
O.O
OH SHIT
Vordox: my neighbour had one of those
IT*S THE SAME BREED :o

Vordox: german sheperd is just the international translation for schäferhund
Well, I'm a tard Wrek :P
Dark_Horst: Yeah just read it
AssaultWithEmbraces, I think it's an alcohol wipe. I'm not sure. It's just something to protect against infection, I think.

"One sentence that describes you"

AssaultWithEmbraces: I'm so awesome.
I don't know what I would write.
Hoping? from a scientist? XD
write 666
AssaultWithEmbraces: Vordox: Paradoxial Vortex.
Besides "I think I'm annoying"
...
AssaultWithEmbraces: I think the concept is entirely bs so I wouldn't care what I wrote XD
Deacon: come on, we have hope too :(
/me hugs AssaultWithEmbraces.
im bach
...
/me hugs Vordox "It's true, I do think that sometimes"
Deacon: thrwing things at walls and hoping they stick is the very essence of science
Everyone is annoying :P
One way or another
Dark_Horst: really?
AssaultWithEmbraces: you is not annoying *huggle*
maybe he did some background checks
Dark_Horst: isnt that madness?
Alchemist: sure. why you think they call it experimenting?
Dark_Horst: you think its completely random?
he's Cirno incarnate
a scientist has no idea what he's doing. he does something, sees what happens and treis to find a way to relate that somehting to the next thing he does
that's how theories are made and tested
dat is a nice rollercoaster
Dark_Horst: I thought it was to refute until proven to be false
"Who's the chick with the long shadow?" :D MY SIDES :D
so...much...bull....
BS! everything is BS
Vordox: science never refutes. it questions
Dark_Horst: I research the self assembly properties of polyelectrolites and surfactants on silica surfaces with an ellipsometer and atomic force microscope.
Dark_Horst: That heh. :P
the refuting part may only occur AFTER something is proven wrong
Alchemist: wut?
Dark_Horst: Oh derp
Dark_Horst: We'd like to see if we can form a double layer of polymers on a surface.
Dark_Horst: Hmm
Dark_Horst: I guess refute means somehing else. :D
Alchemist: that's pretty far in the "see what sticks"-process
Dark_Horst: our method is calculated and in no way random.
Alchemist: you already got something that stuck
aha!
rofl.
That's because he's giving off creep vibes.
Dat precaution.
Alchemist: sure, but were methods that clear when nobody knew what a polymer is?
PHD = So what?
05gary aitn got nothin on dat telescopes girth
Wrek: XD
XD
did the sound just go out?
Fl00t4sh41, it did fo me
Sound, video, everything went out.
Temporarily
It's back
refresh
get adblock
Dark_Horst: this method hasnt been tried yet by anyone else actually.
wipergone2: not my pc
oh
and then all of them are wrong
Alchemist: see? you try something new
you already thre something
now you hope it will stick

Meanwhile: Ronulans live in your hair
You know what? The only thing I disagree with Ron Paul about is foreign policy.
13Fl00t4sh41: except everything in this episode is factually correct
Fun Fact: Over 90% of the all "would be voters" around the world, voted for Ron Paul
Then USA
You know...voted...elsewhat
HA
Shizuka: Its called a political bias
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Artist Training Grounds - Episode Edition Starts Tonight!
he likes the f'bomb
this guy swears to much
my ears are annoyed
too*
artist: das bitching
dat time
Bronysith: there is no law against bitching
i think
Bronysith: There is
there is
Bronysith: It's called "Slurring"
where?
Or something
05Shizuka knows her stuff :3
13that's not sam
13where's connor
Here I am.
dat slanted history
Shizuka: The one who yelled "They are coming?"
ze british are comin
13he didn't yell he more like knocked on the door and said "hey, regulars are on the march"
ze germans are here
I be british :)
Shizuka: Oh, so I was...almost the right person? :D
/me sets Chrysalis on fire
13besides at the time they were all british so no one would be yelling "the british are coming"
Ah, so THIS is Grover Norquist, the boogey-man of the left.
I also be british....no fire
/me pours water on Chrysalis ....then flour.
I'm scandinavian ja
jaaaa
Shizuka: =correct
Shizuka: So it's been twisted?
being british makes me immune to flour
and fire
13Vordox: romanticized over the years
this tax code need s serious revision
Shizuka: Oooh, like the Bible?
13yep
dat edition
oh god nancy pelosi
Vordox, heeeey
editing*
I doubt he calmly informed everyone about an army, maybe somewhere inbetween
Eeeey to you too Kandarihu
13Hoody|Skool: well, they knew the regulars were coming
A promise?
13it wasn't "one if by land two if by sea" cause they knew they were coming over sea
'<--- Poor Teller
Zeus: Its still not interesting
lol
friggin religions, they get away with anything
Wrek: Do we complain about our economy...?
...
the government, is religion
ø
05Vordox: all day erry day
goddamnit
13fun fact, bullshit wanted to do an episode on scientology, but showtime didn't want to provoke lawsuits
XD
05but we secretly lvoe it anyways
I don't notice that.
Shizuka: LOL
13so penn's friends trey and matt did it for south park
scientology is such bullshit
13true story
or tom cruise
Shizuka: Proof of the episode
lol nice Shizuka
Shizuka: you going to get the south park game?
Murikah!
62%?
13uh no..
Wait. 62%?!
As if you need Bullshit to tell you Scientology is a load of bollocks.
Shizuka: TRUE! i watched that episode, and i loved it!
Damn you Danes. :o
Vordox: 65$
Shizuka: doing an episode about scientology would've meant getting their hitmen on their asses
%
Denmark has bacon...so they're pretty cool
Vordox: 65%
What? What did the danes do?
daaaamn
What's happening over there, Denmark?
Vordox: Danish tax isn't as bad as they portray it as
scientology has an own secret service that wages war against anyone who says somethign he shouldnt say
13progressive tax, where the top 1% of the country pays over 40% of all taxes
Nothings happening over here
why is he shouting?
the tax pays for a lot of stuff
...
ASSHATS
Shizuka: Sounds fair?
05its not äppelpaaaaaj~ so im not interested
XD Wrek
13part of this show's aesthetic comes from the base premise: if they were to say "so and so is a LIAR" they'd get sued for defamation
nice wrex
13but if they say "so and so is an ASSHOLE" there's no problem
best logic
hahahaha good one
13so from there it takes a more blunt edge
Shizuka: THAT'S the word I was searching for before, Defamation
Hey Wrek, how long until that KND download is done?
051 second
05aaand done
Wrek: Just gotta wait =3
so its not punishing the Rich...its rewarding the poor?
13uh oh wrek is building some 2x4 technology
XD
good stuff
Penn....bad jokes =P
/me back on Capital Hill...

Ron paul shouldve been president
....sucky....
Oooh Ron?
Ron tells it how it is.
13oh ron
Ron Paul shoulda been Gandalf
he looks like magneto
13you couldn't have been more wrong
goop: Get out.
Gandalf is best Ron Paul
I will not
ಠ_ಠ
Dark_Horst: you're right
Shizuka: Oh really?
norquist
05Vordox: i jsut wish the re-governalized the pharmacy
Ian McKellen is the best.
13sure we had the red wave in 2010, but then everyone stayed home this year and obama gets a second term
05ever sicne they removed the monopoly its been shit
sup guys
Wrek: Well, they have to with the new changes
Shizuka: I've been a favourite of ROn Paul since his work in 1980s
Wrek: beep beep
When he gave a warning of the huge bubble bursting
IN EVERY SINGLE AREA he predicted
whatre we watching
05Deacon: she is the best human ever
....
05she asked an image of me... i can not physically be happier...
ded
Deacon: /mlp/ was not happy
05does that answer your question?
Wrek: :)
Wrek: pinkie pie wants you

BladedWings: hahahahaha

Wrek: did you guys upload the interview somewhere?

http://i.imgur.com/1mffu.gif
Compare congress to a crack addict
JRP2234 blame bronystate, the cause of insomnia
there a nutshell
Shizuka: may I link a video to you?
A random drug addict off the street would do a better job of designing the tax system.
05europeans have the easiest time watchign my streams
Shizuka: If you can have 5 minutes of freetime after this?
JRP2234: dat you?

Lil_B: Know that feel
Ohai Lil_B
lali-ho Lil_B
Heya Lil_B :)
Hi Lil_B
how are things Lil_B
Candle Cove Experiences :: Tales of the Laughingstock"
that one
soo muchh...
13that means for the millions of people that would like this government to gtfo back to the limited powers it was meant to have, there are millions more who are dependent on that very government
oh sweet here we go
Shizu: Which is the idea. Easier to control you if they get you dependent on them.
13yep
Shizuka: Strongest/Fittest but arounda a system? :P
/me hugs BladedWings Vordox AdamTheDuck Deacon MLP_Brovakiin AssaultWithEmbraces alexxm|colt ;)
Hai Lil_B =3

/me hugs Lil_B :3
05ahem
goop: Non non image links during stream
05why you linking creepypasta here?
/me hugs Lil_B back ^-^
Every time I come here, someone is hugging Lill_B.
05keep that shit out
*Lil_B
Some guy asked for it
Sorry i guess
/me hugs DerpyWhooves I don't know why
13learn to PM then
DerpyWhooves Lil_B is huggable :3
Ok how do i PM?
13learn to IRC
13google
come here guys, i have candy
/me licks Lil_B
newfoals?
newfoals
wait no NON image links during stream right what about this http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/16208_404298172980263_1428600570_n.jpg
^
goop: Where are you reading this? on bronystate or the irc?
Right click the name and then query, or double click the name. That tends to work.
....wat
bronystate
DerpyWhooves I usually just hug when I leave to the people who said goodbye, so actually, it only happens once or twice a day, and that, here, isn't much in terms of hugging :3
13STOP idiot politician
13yes the sales tax option would be around 20%
13BUT THAT WOULD BE WITH THE ABSENCE OF ALL OTHER TAXES
goop: Then after that, --> Names on right, find the one you want to PM and double click
Why would you need a sales tax if you install a flat income tax? That's fucking ridiculous
13CriticKitten: it's all misdirection
Try spending less money, for fuck's sake. :|
13they like to say "OMFG NO NATIONAL SALES TAX" because they want people to believe that would be on top of what we have now
13when it would REPLACE what we have
<--- SOLVE YOUR OWN PROBLEMS?
USA?
/me also swipes AdamTheDuck s Saliva off his Face xD
HAHAHAHA
no
'MUUURUCA!
Vordox: we are idiots over here
Shizu: Yeah, a lot of politics nowadays is misdirection sadly
TEY TOOK UR JOOOOOBS
actually, nvm
13"When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic."
DEEERP A DEEEEER
I like these guys with funny hats :3
Shizuka: But I thought your system of tax got created about....
Since the beginning?
AdamTheDuck indeed :)
13oh no
on a side note: one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter
And exactly when does anything come of this storm of gibberish?
It's an outright lie that we'd need a huge sales tax to compensate, if we couple that tax with (gasp) reduced spending.
/me wants a hat like theirs too :$
Shizuka: basically, replace your taxes with more taxes?
13Dark92Enigma: not more
13different
Meanwhile mostly... Sadness for those who ask themselfes this question
Shizuka: So..."how" different?
Deacon: easy: FLIP THE USA FLAG UPSIDE DOWN
13as is you're taxed whether you use the service the tax pays for or not
WOAH
ohai
bush
Why are taxes being discussed on Bronystate?
ha
erm...
stream seems dead to me
<--- damnit Penn and Teller...grow up
EEP
oh hai naked lady
I need an adult
Okay guys, grow up.
13on top of that you're actively discouraged from becoming successful because of progressive taxation
nice hat?
13national sales tax would replace all current taxes with one flat rate on sales
Shizuka: So how about a fully dynamic system for economy balance?
i want that cool hat ^_^
13hahahahahahahahhahahaha
..... this is the best ta documentary EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111
well... let's say this is just good Body Paint
AssaultWithEmbraces: I knowright... >.>
Shizuka: successful people are punished after all
oh dear, shes naked
DerpyWhooves: because Penn & Teller are talking about them
Is Wrek streaming more rage-inducing crap?
I'd never consider a woman who poses nude on camera to be a lady.
IRS! *shakes fist*
laaaadies~
oh mai
Nittany_Discord, if that's what you call it? Yes. XD
Yay equality!
Kandarihu: Agreed.
.....umm idk if i wanna see this
well... I hope it blends away before he's fiully naked :/
Then dont watch it.
Kandarihu: i consider them objects! yay~
Nittany_Discord Not really rage inducing but thought opening stuff? ueah
yeah*
Shizuka: Laugh all you want. Evolution makes mistakes, but those mistakes shapes to the better. :P
LadyCanary: tongue back in your mouth :p
oh hey, naked dudes
IK IK
You'd better not be serious artist
Shizuka: Wouldn't that just place the tax burden on those on have the least money to pay tax?
artist, I consider them messed up people, but they are still people.
13Fl00t4sh41: it forces them to have money in the game
LadyCanary: ofcourse i am!
He's getting juggy
Hm, Ryunosuke?
jiggy*
nothing ;)
13if they want the servies, they'd better damn well help pay for them
Shizuka: And be far insuficient to pay for all the goverments expencies?
Shizuka: So, "screw the poor" then?
MURICA
Shizuka: As stated, fully dynamical economy balance
wait now i know who those guys are there from that magic show thingy they judge magic act right
13as is you have over 40% of the population receiving government benefits and PAYING NOTHING to get them
there was a saying i read a few weeks ago
13that tells them they can demand more
Shizu: And wasn't that the idea behind Cain's flat tax? To replace the tax code with a flat, easily understood tax system?
OMG
Play the one about the Vatican, it'd be more entertaining.
thats who they are oen and teller
lol
YOU GOT IT WREKY!!!!!
Hehe, this show
....is that KND?
basicly, have Taxes, but only the Taxes that make sense, Taxes, that directly help everyone in the country
o.o
i remember this show
13Fl00t4sh41: the top 1% of income earners pay over 40% of all taxes
oh yeah!
"we arent asking people with money to pay more to be dicks and assholes, we are asking them to pay more because they have the resources to do so"
13is that fair?
from boobs and naked people to KND, nice transition Wrek :D
OMFG THIS SHOW WAS MY FUCKING CHILDHOOD HOHOHOHO SHIT
Shizuka: They can afford it
Shizuka: So make them poor? :P
KND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

13Fl00t4sh41: so why do you want their money?
Ah, C.A.K.E.D

Dem Delightful Children
Why is this convo about taxes still going? what're any of you going to do about it.
Shizuka: But you're requesting a chance that causes worse downsides then we already have
A-GAIN
that mustard gas
Shizuka: A goverment has to tax where the money is
13Fl00t4sh41: so they should be punished for providing services that people want to pay for
13got it

That's her secret. Shes always angry.
Shizuka: never noticed that wow

Vordox: Don't get all butthurt because you're less important than you think.
Fl00t4sh41: And this causes ignorance, and ignorances causes unwilling changes

jcelios thats not a real game
Chrysalis: Spy vs Spy vs n multiplayer
How are computers like air conditioners?
and by browser version i mean its the actual game, just in a browser
Someone snuck Quake onto the school network and it is all everyone plays :p

My computer has worked for years
no issues
Socks: Lucky :p

It was popular with the year below and my year hated it :D
MLP_Brovakiin we wernt so cool, we all had a GBA emulator

It my experience your computing experence depends more on you then your software.
in russia thats normal.
ATM it's League of Ledgends with my new school, albeit a select group of people not containing me.
jcelios very true, 99% of all computer problems are PEBKAC
*legends

;3;
7although the website is poorly laid out and like the first 11 can be categorised under 'algebra and functions'
I haven't taken a math class in a couple years

A tale of most great interest brother

/me pulls Socks into a hug and violently smothers him with her hugging
Yep, we've messed up the order a little bit
Mrph!
anyone got the new pokemon game?
AssaultWithEmbraces Socks adorable ^w^
I CAN'T BREATHE!
7I spend half of my maths class doodling minecraft miscellanea on my paper.
which is also an awesome series, unlike that poni shit
well, "new"
Episode is actually.... UNKNOWN
http://25.media.tumblr.com/f688af46b9031cbd85ee8a9e8bdfd074/tumblr_meoq4bgiHp1rncbeqo1_500.png
It's been out a few months now I guess
I get the feeling Hub is pulling a fast one on us :P
Uh...that's kinda the point, Socks
wtf
/me wriggles out and stabs AssaultWithEmbraces
Flumori: Take that back! :P
Bronysith: WTF how did you make an OC better then mine
Bronysith: KILL IT, KILL IT
never!
jcelios: i didnt make it
Bronysith congratulations
how come Polydunami
7BURN THE HEATHEN.
Bronysith: I'm shipping it with my OC then adopting the child and my new OC
thats the worst thing i have ever seen
Bronysith: Bad Oc tumblr? right
Mewtwo can kick all those poni asses
?
They SAY Apple Family Reunion is next...
/me likes OC's :'(
7why do you keep spelling it with an i?
Anyway, that's a discussion for a later time
*OCs
cause SR does that
I dunno, Twilight Sparkle is pretty good at magic
and I like to bug him :)
Socks i dont mind em, but i have a particular hate for pony creator OCs
/me is borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrd
/me slaps Socks with a body pillow and continues to smo--err, hug him. Very tightly.
Everyone loves to bug SR :D
http://i.imgur.com/wd097.jpg
7also if Mewtwo kills Celestia there is no sun and so eventually he dies anyway. If ponies don't win, nobody wins.
http://imgur.com/TnjRy
You have a body pillow?
*In hushed tones* weirdo!
:P
7aye. doodling simple geometric shapes helps me think, on graph paper minecraft provides perfect inspiration.
Gnight everypony, HF :3
jcelios: Instant wallpaper!
^.^
Goodnight Michael :)
Night Michael :)

/me higgles Michael
I want to have a bonfire now

Good night, Michael

Barbetos|PonyMan: That was you explaining that to someone?
Michael: i come u leave seems suspicuis
http://i.imgur.com/5lAod.jpg
AssaultWithEmbraces: No. I am not that witty. XD
i have new headphones
:D
I just watch the pony. =|
Barbetos|PonyMan: Okay. I feel sorry for the person doing the explaining
They tell me too.
Well, the next episode is the second (and hopefully last) episode this season that I can't watch with you. I'll be in a hotel with crummy internet, and I doubt that the TV service even gets The HUB.
new pics
Sorry to hear about that, Kandarihu :(
/me takes Kandarihu to his house and bed to watch the new episode
/me only saw the S3 prem on bronystate and then couldn't use chat :'(
Socks: I know that feel
dang it it went off .-.
7Based on the title, I think not.
Why youtube is bad for studying http://i.imgur.com/WgCjJ.jpg

Kandarihu: Thanks for reminding me that I won't be able to watch the new episode as well.
Linkstorm O.O
jcelios: ah, youre studying electromagnetics?
It's okay. I'll just look forward to watching the episode when I get back. I wouldn't want to do anything piracy related on my relatives' internet connection. They have a home business, and don't want to get in trouble for anything.
twilight_sprinkle: Physics in general

soulrider95
brb, gonna make myself a Chicken sanvich
remember this is a family chat room :)
Awesome it works :D
I just hung it from the ceiling in my room and the next thing I knew it was half deflated

I tried, but it was impossible to find all the holes
I have it set to do the Na'Vi "Hey, Listen!

MadSurge!

I wish I had college problems
One of the holes was between two of the "claws" and just kept getting bigger as I tried to patch it
alexxm: thanks man
and there better then high school problems
AssaultWithEmbraces: are you "bulky" enough to take a Pinkie superhug? :D
Grography and International relations
it sounds more like it has been desentigrating
MadSurge: I doubt it but I'ma go for it anyways!
I think I just sucked at fixing things :P
hah its all good
AssaultWithEmbraces: the bones cracking? It is a sign of the hate going awaaaaaay :D
MadSurge: Destroy all the hate!

[12:50:09] Fluttershy sets mode +v Brett_
oh no, someone made a reference to something I don't like
My life is ruined
what issue?
I'm wondering more of what Pinkie is.
weather they shall be featured and yes :3
?
I don't understand
so when should the newsletter be out
soon i suspect
I'm skeptical of them being featured this season. That's all I can say.
survey closes on thursday, has to be out soon
Sarcasm
Polydunami i agree, i look at new species by the greed of hasbro and they already have crystal ponies to sell
why is burning stuff so much fun?
I always seem to miss that
it can be hard to catch on the internet
no
well it has fluttershy, so no probably
Really?
jcelios bc you are an attention attractor with a hoodie filled with spaghetti
I didn't notice
I still think it's a cute picture
8-)
I see what you did there :O
twilight_sprinkle: why do all the bronies love fluttershy?
Also, resolution :O
evil fluttershy is still cute

Episode 8 of season 3 "Apple Family Reunion" airs in 3 days, 17 hours, 10 minutes, 1 seconds (Dec 22 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
Fluttershy isn't my favourite
I didn't
ah
8-)
Is fluttersky supposed to be a MLP reference?
im a dashie and luna fan
But I still think she's a cute pony
Bronysith: heck if i know, prolly cause shy, altho everyone forgets how mean she can be
twilight_sprinkle: shes shy and cute, thats it
No
twilight_sprinkle: even though she is a selfish bitch
My name is Original the Character
Bronysith and thats cute
eh?
Bronysith also the yay thing
she is just so meh
Bronysith: true, her kindness extends mostly to critters
this be Fluttershy https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Zx4eHRFSXQs/TrhaZlNFToI/AAAAAAAADGE/9hKYWO4WP3E/s493/you__re_going_to_love_me_by_envidia14-d3frmm8.jpg
hard to convince her to help other ponies
twilight_sprinkle: she also demonstrated her selfshiness in the trixie episode
I see..
http://i.imgur.com/JdCkv.gif this is a fluttershy.
bleh, ponies as usual..
Polydunami dat tounge lol jk
well duh.
Bronysith: exactly, element of kindness- if you hurt my pets on accident, ill hrt you to fix it
http://darkspyro.net/news/68176/
Polydunami: thats somewhat frightening
time to add some spyro news to this place
darkspyro? blasphemy!
:D
hey, I was going to say that
:<
twilight_sprinkle: my friend exiled from ponyville? my home being taken over by an evil corrupt bitch? "I WANNA GO HOME AND BE IN MY BED"
Oh, it's "tongue" by the way
bannable offence.
Common mistake :P
i cant spell
...
so do ponies have religion?
Fluttershy is such an unlikeable bitch
DEAR GOD
I dont think any of us have been following the rules
:'(
MY EYES
I don't think I can ban the channel owner, sorry SR :P
there are no rules.
but she does those little "squees" or "yays" and the whole fandom loves her
bullshit
exactly
Bronysith but shes soo cute
7Except don't talk about spyrochat.
:'(
so don't give me this blasphemy stuff
I dont have owner or anything because the network is messed up.
7That is the first rule of spyrochat
You really want to ban me SR?
Who made this Darkspyro site?
It is horrendous
Flumori, it's sarcasm again :P
Bronysith i dont think fluttershy could be a hitler
...
05hey atleast hitler killed hitler
05right?
I would have to ssh into charizard and I forget the password
05anyways
and username.
05sleep
It's like Purple meets 1998
Wrek: hitler killed the guy who killed hitler
@Wrek good point
I'm pretty sure you're the only one seeing this
Hitler is best Hitler
but whatever
i dont hate her though, i dont hate anypony, altho i do think shes the least nice and very overrated
then add myself to opers
because the oper list was wiped.
That's not a sound argument, anyway. Hitler has nothing to do with Fluttershy.
Am I the only one in a rage at the moment?
yep.
yep
twilight_sprinkle: she, rainbow dash, and pinkie pie are most overrated
SR you should still have oper
There's no way I still would if you didn't
SR if it pisses you off that much then maybe my time is almost up here..
we were oper'd at the same time
Flumori what are you talking about?
Bronysith but dashie is best mane six pony (in my opinion)
Your acting like you wanna kick me out of this place
Bronysith: rarity needs some love
Maybe you should calm your ass down and relax.
twilight_sprinkle: and of course applejack gets nothing
it's just a joke, no one wants to kick anyone out
No one was serious about anything.
have I ever been serious about anything?
Eh... You're kinda overreacting Flumori...
aj is best backround pony
Bronysith: well the next ep seems to be an AJ one, that might change things
I am calm, cant exactly get mad while sick :/
at least judging from the title
there have been alot of dash eps this season
I want to kick something
yea
2 in a row
Preferably something kickable
no rarity eps so far
why? o.o
Like a kickball
well rarity was in the week before last
Or a soccerball
and t was more a scootaloo ep
Or Honey Booboo
twilight_sprinkle: well TBF applejack got her own episodes...but no one payed attention to her, only derpy and the flim flam brothers
brb
flim flam were pretty damn noticable
if its still there I cant remember it.
Bronysith: yeah but i dont think thats the writers fault that people cant get over 20 seconds of derpy to shift their attention back to aj
true
Ill keep trying passwords.
i just dont know what went wrong
lul
Lul indeed
sprunkls
xD
and didnt restore it
this season needs a really good, winter wrap up level song
why would he do that?
upgrades?
can you oper?
yes
weird
I probably just forget my password.
maybe I could change it?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Meghan McCarthy's New Episode Tease
thelonepony perhaps
I don't know if that's something I am allowed to do
i dont think it would let you
twilight_sprinkle: we had one, have you notice the seasons changing in the background?
During season 3 i mean
yeah
I think only the network owner can do that.
daribot spoiler
whos the network owner?
a teaser huh?
still i think we should get a hannukah ep lol im not jewish it would be funny tho
He's never here anymore though
well, gonna avoid that for now
I dont really care too much
twilight_sprinkle: i know
Polydunami awww :)
twilight_sprinkle: i just realized, only twilight and pinkie pie have stayed loyal to their elements
Best pony, huh?
Party of One
never said that
im gunna head out
http://derpy.me/YUviy
peace pplz :D
yeah, I don't think he's ever online though
Bronysith: true, but i suppose flaws are only natural
idle if anything
well yeah there is party of one
BAI
twilight_sprinkle: yea, but even then twilight forgets shes a unicorn at some points XD
I could send him a facebook message? :P
Bronysith: well the writing was never as brilliant as people say it is
Better than what it used to be
twilight_sprinkle: whatever, the show is still enjoyable, but what it lacks is CONSISTENCY
i even feel a bit sorry for the writers, seems to me that theyre a bit out of league with the expectations
twilight_sprinkle: they also being forced to take ideas from bronies
goddamnit who ever is in charge
http://derpy.me/J3uV8
Bronysith: Really? wow
Bronysith: well, im just in it for the cute ponies with likeable and often relatable characters :P
so as long as it has that, ill probably like it
twilight_sprinkle: yup, cause tehre are good episodes, but its been taking a steady downfall since after the season 2 premiere
that and the dynamic and very lively style it has
Nest of Twilight :3
Hi everypony
Hey there, Pwny
Ohai Pwny
hoi Pwny
Hi Pwny
twilight_sprinkle: and of course, the animation, is wonderfully beautiful
For Rainbow Dash fans instead
ttp://derpy.me/DjSLt
Whoops
Bronysith: yeah, the animation is a big part of the dynamic and lively style
twilight_sprinkle: i just feel since lauren left it has gone downhill
For EVERYONE
http://derpy.me/cYuXf
I still think Twilight is cuter
Vordox: yay
rainbow terrible is the worst horse though
woops, i accidentally the tab
Polydunami: thank you
Any Pinkie PIe fans here?
http://derpy.me/hBeyp
Just my opinion
Vordox: the First one didnt work
SO MUCH RESOLUTION
you're missing the h in Http
Also, not in this picture
twilight_sprinkle: and it really does feel like they are trying to make the show more epic...but come on, its ponies, they can have their adventures...but trying to make it lord of the rings? no, just no
http://derpy.me/-Wdc-
?
so i habe a little question is there any dvd box including every episode from season 1 and/or 2 ? cause i am searching for dvd boxes and in germany there are only the boxes with 2 or 3 episodes per dvd -.-
Bronysith: yeah and s2 finale felt more like action than ponies
Hahahaha
twilight_sprinkle: and teh fight scene with the changelings, was indeed, just fanservice and pointless
Vordox why
Nuff said
Pwny: i think there is, and i think Sumica has a dvd like that
For Fluttershy Fans!
http://derpy.me/aQafC
twilight_sprinkle: beginning of season 2 "theres a spell on the door only i can break" end of season "go get the elements twilight"
but old gen
twilight_sprinkle: hahahahah
we has new ponehs now
twilight_sprinkle: so even if they made it to where the elements were "yay we did it....how the fuck do we open this?"
Aaand one more for Fluttershy fans!
http://derpy.me/9wLkA
Again. I still think the Twilight one is cuter.
I dont know why but this is funny :D http://derpy.me/cpPRh
and now pizza is here, so i nom on delicious cheese and sauce
Bronysith: yeah theres plenty of plot holes in the show, but eh, after all it was oriented for children and i would prefer it stay that way, i dont expect a perfect story from it
00,10there is such a DVD set yes Pwny, but however it's only in US Canada and Australia IIRC
Okay, let's go all out "d'aaaaaw"
http://derpy.me/tQ0Jm
Well, d'aaw for me :P CMC ftw!
new avgn ep
many things.
00,10http://www.amazon.com/My-Little-Pony-Friendship-Magic/dp/B0096W47NO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1354836817&sr=8-1&keywords=friendship+is+magic+season+1
twilight_sprinkle: i know, but people saying the wedding is the best episode....is wrong, the writing wasnt consistent, the characters say things that contradict themselves and overall, most overrated episode of the series
I'm surprised at Sweetie Belle's pointy horn
Polydunami: http://derpy.me/6so5I You said what?
why do people use fanpop, seems like a terrible image-sharing site to me, too much junk around the page which makes it slow and the image frame is small
funnyjunk is worse
fuck you and your fucking regional bullshit
ah thx then i have to import them :)
JRP2234: pay me double the amount and ill mail it to you
Buytoast: true
Bronysith: true, it was mostly hype, although i do maintain that this day aria was the best song
But then we have my favourite pony outside of background Pony AJ <3
http://derpy.me/r2oFs
Forever my fave
and STILL no uk releas
You mean the part where I find Twilight cuter?
"Region: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only"
fuck
you
true, funnyjunk doesnt even link to the image, whats up with that
Chrysalis as i understand we haven't had the show air here yet though
alexxm nope
twilight_sprinkle: i can see people liking it, but it is kind of insulting to lauren, who made previously established characters, and some of them still dont even have a song when 1 time characters got their own XD
who invented this idea and why are they allowed to live
BRB
http://derpy.me/XuY1R
Vordox :O
i like
Well, that's a cute image too
Bronysith: hm i dont really see how its insulting to her, more like just not very well thought-through progression
yay
my ps2 finished downloading
Fine, last one, Pinkie Pie fuller Fill fun furiously fantastical fr...I'm out of F http://derpy.me/GUB79

SuperBrony64 wakey wakey

Good morning Gold_Demona!
Hiyo MadSurge =)
Imformed.
And hello Ninjazz :)
It's the new spelling of informed.
Hey hey Surge.
Informd of what Mojay?
Chat ded? :<
11,02JRP2234: O3O
11,02Who's streaming? o.o
11,02ded chat is ded
eyup
SuperBrony64
lll
11,02The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Fate (Wii U - Q4 2013) :)
Phase4 wake up
3ds?
?
wait
fate
Whers the fucking mask SuperBrony64
SuperBrony64, source
cause that sounds like a nasty rumors
They're gonna make more stuff about Majora?
11,02CrystalPhoenix: Can't give em, sorry.
11,02Not sure who is streaming O~O but hopefully he doesn't mind me posting this link: http://www.terriblefate.com/
Wrek has seemed to disconnected
And there he goes.
/me hugs Wrek ^-^
Ohai Wrek
11,02"You find out the backstory of Majora and the mask he sculpted. You play as Link found trapped in a Hyrule that’s been twisted with fear and hate. You’ll switch roles during the adventure to try and piece together the puzzle of Majora’s Fate before Hyrule reaches total destruction."
05facking shitfacessdgiokerjg
i'm close to getting 1st prestiege in black ops
SuperBrony64, now where did you get that description?
Yay, creepy Zelda again! :$
first the HL3 beta and now this
SuperBrony64: you better not be yanking my chain ;3;
Ha
its using the same counter as this http://halflife3beta.com/
there's something fishy about this countdown
whats so significant about the 21st?
Phase4 ps2 direct x
Terrible Fate is an album dedicated to Zelda.
11,02"One last info in the game is you’ll meet with a mysterious character in the game, similar to the Happy Mask salesman named Fahra. She’ll give helpful pointers to Link through his journey. Her face is covered with many masks that she carries in a satchel that show off her emotions."
like how it's revealed in the "end of the world"
Yeah no this ain't an official entry
I really want to believe this is real but Im not putting my eggs in the basket quite yet
oni_link, or it is real
it's just not from Nintendo
What's there to invest? You're all playing the waiting game anyway.
SuperBrony64 have a lick
/me licks SuperBrony64
CrystalPhoenix: Yeah, Im just wondering exactly what the heck is gonna happen when the timer reaches zero
my guess
an album of remix
I think so too
the guy looks like to be a musician
looking the facebook linked to the page
*at
you can see hes done more work like that
and how the countdown reach "the end of the world" in a non-professional way
wrek how do i play ps2?
yup
it makes really suspicious that it's actually Nintendo
JRP2234: buttons :D ba dum tch
CrystalPhoenix: I really would love Nintendo to get back to the darker Zelda I grew up with though
OOT and MA were epic
they need a combat training mode like c o d
meh
nothing has met my expectations since then
Nintendo right now is casualized same old thing except it's over glorified
if nintendo were smart they would port majoras mask to 3ds
the 3ds oot is an excellent port
all the bugs from the n64 are there
JRP2234, that would most likely happen
Yeah but Zelda seems to be getting more and more watered down
kinda like square not giving us ffvii hd
oni_link, welcome to this generation of console gaming
can i ask a question
Crysis 5?
WHO THE FUCK IS JOHN MADDIN
djblazekin, maybe they have thought of that but haven't decide to pursue any action because it's not time
some former football coach JRP2234
JRP2234, you've watched AVGN haven't you
MABEH
no
your ruby is crap
afl is the way to go
Skyward Sword was dissapointing artistically . It had lots of room for really dark and genuinely good designs but they made it too happy. Zelda is going the Mario route with happy faces and a lack of dark and scarier things
JRP2234, they say he's a ghost astronaut on the moon who comes out at night to feed on the patriotism of other lost astronauts
There was an old game just like that, Adam.
this generation of consoles sucks :c halo was a disappointment to me, COD is COD. everything looks like its losing its luster
or theyre bleeding it dry
oni_link, go back to the old classics.
I do
all the time
^_^
I really need to play STALKER again...
AdamTheDuck: i've got a ps2 for that reason
But so many other games to play too ;~;
and PS2 with BronyState as well
AdamTheDuck: Im gonna play that game when my tower is done :)
that too!
I would love to be able to play a sequel to MM though
any noticed avgn has not used his song for the past 3 eps?
i ment playstation 2
with the same art style but with todays graphics
Im asking for too much though. Nintendo doesn't deliver anymore
if you can find one oni_link get a 60gb ps3 and then you'll be set for todays and yesteryears titles
only reason I'd get a PS3 would be for MGS4
good morning my little ponies
um the new avgn ep is stuck at 2,827
other than that, Im not too crazy about Sony's exclusives
Mornin' jcelios
hey jcelios
I want to get a 3DS for Professor Layton ;~;
iyo jcelios
hiyo*
AdamTheDuck: I heard good things about that game
Loved the first and second game...
Then my DS broke ;~;
you might want to pick up mgs hd collection and mgs1 with mgs4 chronolocicly for story it goes peacewalker 3 1 2 then 4
its hard to play ps2 WHEN IT FUCKING CRASHES ON START
djblazekin: Yeah I know my MGS story :P 4 is the only one I havent played along with peacewalker
/me slaps JRP2234 around a bit with a large trout
AdamTheDuck: I has the 3DS paper mario :)
Phase4
somthing worng
MadSurge: How is that game?
I love me some PS1 and PS2 era MGS ^.^
/me hugs AdamTheDuck
peacewalker comes before 3 in the story and 4 is the finisher mgs rising i think is a side story to mgs2
oni_link: People got mad because it doesn't have a big plot and it has a bizarre attack gimmick, but I think it's not so bad
/me licks SuperBrony64 :3
MadSurge: is it similar to Super Paper Mario?
oni_link: you mean more platformey? Kinda
i think so from the small bit i've played
MadSurge: Did they go back to the turn based gameplay though?
i dont think so
oni_link: yes, but you don't have partners (you don't really need them abyway)
*n
MadSurge: I think I want to pick it up then. I prefer the turn based style to the way Super Paper Mario did things. The first one was still my favorite
oni_link: the first one was nice :) it's just bizarre that the others tried to make epic plots... with freaking Super Mario
MadSurge: Just like sonic XD we know what our objective is, there's no need to stretch it out and make it seem more complicated than it really is! you just add a whole lot of dialogue that no one wants to be bothered with!
.....The Hub picked up Animaniacs?
I saw that on Facebook :o
When did this happen?!?
oni_link: yeah, but also, there's monsters destroying the world... and you're still stomping GOOMBAS.
kljoffeewewoeiropweiieropw
Phase4`
CriticKitten: a while ago, I think
MadSurge: it sounds fun :3
Well that makes me excited. ^^
oni_link: in the newer one it's just Bowser getting powerful through magic stickers :D nothing complicated :D
MadSurge: awesome!
That is....the most perfect, accurate, awesome cosplay I've ever witnesses. http://25.media.tumblr.com/aa7c902e94a98c7624804c915f16e812/tumblr_mf7u3aSB3x1qbnnp7o1_500.jpg
well crap
dat jaymoo here?
that is epic
it puts every cosplayer to shame
Gold_Demona: lurk?
/me lurks
CrystalPhoenix: :D better than the super accurate ones!
MadSurge, what are you talking about
/me hands muffin to Gold_Demona
This one is the most accurate
/me eats muffin in the shadows. :3
CrystalPhoenix: the ones more truthful to Advent Children then :D
Advent Children?
is that supposed to be cloud
What is this Advent Childrean you speak of?
*sarcasm
its the ffvii movie that takes place after 7
Two years after FF7, if I remember right
/me points at my post that says *sarcasm
i just finished 7 and watched advent children
I need to try FF7 sooner or later
sorry but what game is this
forcast for my area snow snow and more snow
pony_3130: Planetside 2
ok thank you
Does the Friday forecast include fire and brimstone? :D
i showed this to my friends and they thought is was a halo mmofps
'Scuse you :P
nom nom muffin :D
lol
nope a giant blizzard brought to you by sombra
hey Gold_Demona ? it not snowing yet
aniderp|bestcakeever: You'd have to tell me when it snows. I live in Florida, where it never snows. :P
saturday it will
friday it wont snow now only rain
I'm kinda creeped out how there are always like 80 people in the channel who i've never seen speak :o
i can bring up a seven day forcast for florida on the wii
i can too xD
i know how to tell time in other countries like japan!
ipod tells me :P
hey Gold_Demona what is cupertino?
i went to the grocery store and i couldnt find zingers or twinkies or hohos
aniderp|bestcakeever: Hell if I know
aniderp|bestcakeever: is where Apple lives
djblazekin: That's because the company that owned those things no longer exists.
ohh apple lives in cupertino
ok then!
kellog needs to buy thoes properties i need twinkies for the comming end of the world
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California
It's where all the Apple lay lines of the world converge
djblazekin: Why kellog specifically? O_o
kellogs or post
But they're cereal companies...
what part of florida are you in Gold_Demona ?
i wanna input in my ipod for the weather thingy :P
one of them make fruit rollups and fruity gushers
aniderp|bestcakeever: Central Florida. Just a little south of Daytona Beach.
daytona i will put then
Fruit snacks aren't really the same thing as snackie cakes. =/
aniderp|bestcakeever: If you wanna get specific, I'm in Deltona
ohh i got a chirstmas tree snackie cake
hopefully it still there.. i found it yesterday o.O
djblazekin: I'd say Little Debbie would be more likely to buy them up.
Cuz they're a snackie food company
Google should buy them
no
lol
or betty crocker
it would taste like hologram
How do you know what a hologram tastes like? O_o
do holograms taste bad?
well...
planketon says
they have a "light" flavour
You're going to believe planketon? >.>
i can find a picture of food then lick my laptop?
c=xD
c=xD looks like some weird engineering equation
holograms have no flavor i went to mikuopolous and the miku hologram got her hand in my teeth and i tasted nothing
aniderp|bestcakeever: but all you'd get from that is the flavor of the screen. XD
my screen needs to be clean before i lick it
or i could get sick D:
Eeyup
i dont need to be getting sick D:
/me coughs on aniderp|bestcakeever
i'm between changing my xbl gamertag to either d3rpyd4sh or tw1lightsp4rkl3
come up with something original!
<--- like this!
/me sneezes on AdamTheDuck
I think I heard somewhere that there are some food companies buying up some of Hostess' products to rescue them from going extinct. Hopefully somebody will pick on twinkies. XD

spitfire vs rainbow dash in a race who'd win

dash
because supersonic speed
but yeah prob dash :)
spitfire migt be better when it comes to agility
/me noms on himself
Who of the mane six should I do next for my Rainmeter Ponies project?
would sibsy have a chance she is the only pegisus with a car if she had a suped up bugatti veyron with nos would she be rainbow dash 1/4 mile drag
if they both start from the ground then it would be possible
stock bugatti hits 261 mph but i suped one up on gt5 and it hits around 401 mph straight road with nos it would probably hit 436mph
Do they want you to take a picture? :D
stream can't handle da graphix
:D
anyway
who of the mane six should i add next<ß
I don't even remember if I have Desktop Ponies installed.

Dawn of the second day. 48 hours remain... DAFAQ YOU AT LINK!?
Chat? You alive chat?

Chat is dead, long live the chat.
I dunno, I rarely play LoL.
chat is slow in the morning
its slow during sunlight hours
I love the smell of chat in the morning.
Did you get my Majoras Mask reference? It was the funniest thing I've said ever!
Gold_Demona: do you match your socks?
aniderp|bestcakeever: Yeah
RoboGerbil: Joke's on you, we don't have sunlight hours this time of the year.
i dont match my socks D:
aniderp|bestcakeever: But I wear weird socks, so it doesn't really matter. =P
i wore a matching pair of socks
work was like wow you matched then
jokes on us all, friday is coming...
Link better be doing something more productive than playing cool song on his ocarina.
i wear the mismatched socks
I don't wear my socks if they don't match. I just kind of stare at them in disgust and find a matching pair.
my mom bitches at me for not matching i swear she joined the fashion poliece
aniderp|bestcakeever: I wear themed socks and toe socks.

my local anime con is thinkig of having a 50 shades of grey dramatic reading pannle do you think it will go well
djblazekin: how many guys are gonna read the entire thing with no female presence?
djblazekin: If they replace "dramatic reading" with "Mario impression," maybe.
there will be females but zapp branigan will be the narrorator
Don't worry guys... I got this... javascript:void(0);
CTHULHU: free to play, if you're interested
Damn

CTHULHU: we got a bronystate outfit too
Listen mates, I got this. Calm down. http://i1075.photobucket.com/albums/w433/TheRandomkid321/th_Photoon2012-12-19at23433_zpsd9c5acdd.jpg
And with outfit, he means team. In the game.
djblazekin, that's a really trashy novel
Virtually.
Kammerjunk: more like guild

RoboGerbil: I don't see the difference. A bunch of people together.
ok yeh.. its a sausage fest
there were alot of females at the derpy dose dallas pannel
the room was packed
djblazekin: I don't think I want to know what that's about.
Because I know what debbie Does Dallas is about.
Debbie*

My point is that it was a porno.

Everything good anyways
Barbetos Wut?

hi
Bit too late for that, mate. If it exists.
It was inevitable.
we all agreed that rarity is the high maintnence gold digger gf
Yeah. It exsists. I know that. Its just going to get out of control, and when the word brony is said it will be tagged with the stigma of furries.
Barbetos: Hell, there's even R34 of King Sombro and the G-word which shall not be named.
