tough ships, lots of weapons, planet-crackers
08,01Luna is in a bad state, and we're trying to raise funds to help her
Wasn't the point of that thing to be quiet about it?
Paper Tongues?
when i was
Yeah
a young boy
Wow
08,01even though we've reached the stated goal, we still need more people to donate if you can
my farther
I'm contributing right away
and thats enough MCR
I think that is wrong actually...
gotta donate moar money
yeah i donated already
08,01Alchemist: it's not thoguh; the goal is arbitrary, and only there because a goal had to be input
o, i get it
I would donate if I had money... It is good that the community is helping Luna in her time of need.
ramming with sheilds still up?
fail
he's gonna go independance day on them
08,01we still need as many people to help as possible
Oh...
Poor girl :(
http://i.imgur.com/IW7jZ.png
I wish I had the disposable income to contribute. Alas.
awesome destruction sequence there
08,01Alchemist: as much as possible, really
08,01it's to pay for meds and transport to the hospital
there goes several hundred dollars of ship
If she is far from the needed amount I may be able to donate once more in a month.
hah
Ironic
That couch
Spaced.
its just a hauler
at least use a logistics ship
I mean.. Is taht even really glass?

Nintendo's philosophy is "Well why CAN'T we just release the same damn thing every year?"
different enemy design
people were fucking angry that its wii exclusive, while totally not caring about the fact that if the exclusiveness was a condition to get the job of developing it
11,02oni_link: Hurry up though, most places are sold out of it already D:
cool
different enemies altogether
if they had said no, there wouldnt be a sequel at all
different feel

honestly, the Halo series is the only thing I considered buying an xbox for
which is why I bought a ps3
0,14ba dum psh
also got HARD
0,14XD
I hold Halo responsible for the negative trends in fps gaming nowadays.
11,01I saw Halo4 SP footage, and I wasn't really impressed by it.
A plague upon it's house.
0,14yeah, yeah, repetative and shit
GIVE US ANIMAL CROSSING!
bbboooooooooo wiiU
really?
REALLY!?
I hold idiot consumers and the publishers that feed them responsible.
wy did they call it wi u when they havnt named any of their consoles after another.. ever
but they're the ones shelling out the money and bitching about it
FUCKING REALLY!? INSTEAD OF GO KARTS YOU GET TO RUN AFTER EVERYBODY
BUT THERE ISNT
11,01I have to blame CoD.
looks a bit interesting
0,14^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
take it to mane :P
oh
was taht?
it's ALL mini games
-.-
WAS THAT!?!!?!
PIKMIN 3?!?!

oh
OH FUCK YOU!
My personal favourite is the whole "add multiplayer to it" trend.
Wii U EXCLUSIVE weapon
Oh, fuck everything.
0,14XD
11,02Lyra`: Oh yeah, they announced Pikmin 3 :)
WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN MAPS!
11,02I'll show the trailer after this ;3
Also health regen was, I believe, pioneered by CoD.
d-d-d-double kick
WE SHOULD HAVE HAD MAPS! AND RADAR!
If Halo hadn't done as well as it did then those wouldn't have become the staple.
http://lolpics.se/pics/7735.jpg
And we wouldn't be where we are.
11,02YEAH FUCK THEM FOR BRINGING GAMES TO OTHER CONSOLES, HOW DARE THEY
but this here has to be a joke
0,14it's like everyone sat on tacks
it's delicious
I wanna try NintendoLand

But 'free' do you mean pirated? :I
Meh. I actually managed to get interested in other shows and series ever since Season 2 ended.
No.
Oh cool, is it on the site?
I mean illicitly gained through semi-shady means that skirt the borders of illegality and are largely untraceable by the authorities.
I've been watching breaking bad from start to end of season 3 right now
Lol.....
Id like to legit have it :D
I do not care for COD
Look at it like Photoshop.
I've yet to watch Breaking Bad.
I hear it's really good.
If i wasnt worried about pirating, I would have Photoshop and be making a desktop pony for myself.

OKay. Thanks. :)

Either than that, nothing else.
