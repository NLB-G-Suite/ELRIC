FlutterMEDIC: I can see that happening. :D
hi Invi
FlutterMEDIC: awesome
So what're we watching?
HI FOR EVERYONE
Man I meant to say Hi Invi
Yeppy do!
Stary, you did ^^
FlutterMEDIC: There's an old pic, but one of my favorites :).
YAY!
Howdy Meanwhile!
If you type part of a name and press tab Stary it'll fill the rest out by itself.
Ohhh okay :p thanks for the tip! :)
Meanwhile: That saves up on time. Lol.
You're welcome.
DOne.
Stary: Just make sure the name is the one you want.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1526/ RUN WOONA
Everlasting_Joy: Yep
14 question test, 6 of which are ball busters. Let's see my calc kids brag how "easy" this is. >_>
If I asked everyone here who their favorite Princess is, the leading vote would be Luna am I right? :3
Probably not.
^
I don't have a favorite princess.
^
Same here.
I'm more of a Cadance person
Cadance for me :).
08,01i prefer queens.
True, not many people would have a favorite Princess...
11,01I like Luna the most.
I like evil Celestia, but Luna is the cutest ^^
/me has not fav princess
Invi: Yeah, I could agree with that. :3
Cadence has amused me more than the other two so far.
Zuxxez123: Yeah... :)
The silence... It's akward...
But if Celestia and Luna is Princesses there must be a king and a queen!
posting ponies time http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1986/
Queen Celestia kind of sounds odd... but it would fit her since she's the eldest and all.
08,01LadyCanary: changeling queens
Ohohoh~
Same thing I guess.
08,01if i had a Chrysalis, she could be any pony princess i wanted.
MilkyWhiskers: Maybe they will have the parents show in the third season.
MilkyWhiskers: Fanfiction will fulfill those dreams :)
Stary: Eyup.
I think some people might have a problem with that
Stary, fanfiction already did ^^
For anyone who doesn't know, Lauren Faust wanted Celestia to have a Queen title, but she considered that the title would sound cold and tyrannical. So she went with Princess Celestia.
Invi: Eeyup!
Even without the title of Queen, Celestia is still treated like a tyrant in fandom anyways.
Also, hi LadyCanary :)
that and queen = evil, princess = good
AJIsAwesome: A little backstory, I didn't know that. You are making me a bit more smarter, well played.
she still seems cold and tyranical
AJIsAwesome: Ye the fandom makes jokes about her being a tyrant anyway
i cant imagine what type of power can have one upon celestia
08,01i want to be a pretty pretty princess
Alas.
or luna
And Molestia and Trollestia
btw, saw the new Princess Cadance toy commercial
what is this song called?
08,01Stary: i'd prefer Molestia
Guess who's birthday it is today!
so id say the title didnt make much of a difrence she still seems cold and tyranical, at least in the fanfiction
Even though I don't have a favorite princess, I prefer Celestia over Luna.
Kandarihu|Birthday: The Queen's mother?
Kandarihu|Birthday: mine?o.o
Mine
Happy birthday, Kandarihu|Birthday! :)
i like luna over celestia
Happy birthday Kandarihu|Birthday!
Kandarihu|Birthday: oh, well happy birthday then! :D
Trollestia seems odd anyways, Luna has the better fanbase!
Kandarihu|Birthday: happy birthday!
happy birthday Kandarihu|Birthday
Oh my Kandarihu|Birthday happy birthday.
/me 08,01is now a red and black alicorn
Happy birthday Kandarihu!
happy birthday Kandarihu|Birthday
08,01i'm celestia's cousin
lawl
08,01and i move the planets
NO.
cool
PLEASE STOP.
Happy BirthDay Kandarihu|Birthday! ;)
Happy Birthday Kandarihu|Birthday :)
08,01only i can save equestria by sleeping with all of the mane 6
XD
wut
:D
princess Celestia/Molestia/Trollestia seems cold and tyranical to me anyway even if she doesnt have a queen title
6_9
dammit for about 4-5 times have I entered my A and b movie choices to find out just now they awerent eligible :[
though alo of that opinion is based on the way shes portrayed in fanfiction shes a total ass to humans
08,01Stary: sssh! i'm actually Molestia
08,01and a changeling
>_> <_<
:D
Alchemist: That's a shame, what movies were they?
<_< >_>
:D
:S
08,01so that was Clear Skies 1
08,01who would like to see the next one?
Does their acting improve in Clear Skies 2?
Then again, I don't really care.
08,01Meanwhile: it does
X3
I do (
Then sure.
I want to see the next one.
Zuxxez123: Man on fire was the A movie (there is a different earlier version of it I wasnt aware of and thats why it was omitted), and Animatrix was the other, which was omitted because its a collection of 4-5 shorts and its not a "coherent" movie.
hai thelonepony
:)*
hi Invi :3
Wow, that was one long video, sweet! :D
Alchemist: Interesting choices; I actually like your choices.
HNNNNNNNNNNNG http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4257/

Zuxxez123: I was wondering if I could replace "The intouchables" with animatrix. Is it considered to be a b movie?

Chrysalis: Yep :). That's why I find it appropriate you posted it.
speaking of Wrek, talk Wrek
08,01Chrysalis: we should meet up again sometime

GilDash, indeedy ^^

Luna...
Seriously, why do people do that.
:'(
Cripes... talk about long time no see.
nah

/me tries to summon luna
08,01oh Luna was back!
08,01everyone try and summon her with your MIND POWERS!
For all of a second or two, yeah. :S
:O
/me chants incantation for Luna's return.
Is there a NLR uprising that I walked into?
http://i.imgur.com/UXZt1.png
/me hugs Luna
To be honest you're only likely to freak her out with that kind of welcome.
Meanwhile nope
Im more of a NMM person than Luna
warning: incoming titans
08,01Meanwhile: no, it hink that was our Luna; not sure , though
I know who it was.
08,01she was dialing in from teh Netherlands
08,01where our Luna is
We'd bombard her with hugs and affection! Who wouldn't want that?!
I wouldnt
Meanwhile wouldnt
I wouldn't either.
She's shy...
OMG.
That's just how this place is though. XD
I HEAR QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE.

Shizu Shizu :3
Bronysith yup
Luna's not even here anymore.
knew itr
chats deeeeeead
08,01so, speaking of Luna
srsly, what is a titan and whats so bad about one?
DoctoDoctorWho, Titans are the largest class of ship in Eve, takes a lot of skills and money to get one together
08,01you may or may not have heard about this: http://www.indiegogo.com/saveluna
tough ships, lots of weapons, planet-crackers
kirzstryfe you also lose some of said skills if you die while piloting one
08,01Luna is in a bad state, and we're trying to raise funds to help her
kirzstryfe: so, uber uber superweapon battleship?
Wasn't the point of that thing to be quiet about it?
Sounds familiar.
...Oh sweet jesus XD
so exhausting...
Paper Tongues?
when i was
Yeah
a young boy
Wow
08,01even though we've reached the stated goal, we still need more people to donate if you can
my farther
I'm contributing right away
and thats enough MCR
I think that is wrong actually...
not the rusty but dependable scrap-ship :(
08,01Stary: read the link, it'll explain it better than i can
gotta donate moar money
yeah i donated already
08,01Alchemist: it's not thoguh; the goal is arbitrary, and only there because a goal had to be input
o, i get it
I would donate if I had money... It is good that the community is helping Luna in her time of need.
kirzstryfe: so, uber uber superweapon battleship?
The goal would be reached when she's better. If she's not better, the goal's not been reached. :S
ramming with sheilds still up?
fail
he's gonna go independance day on them
08,01we still need as many people to help as possible
Oh...
Poor girl :(
http://i.imgur.com/IW7jZ.png
I wish I had the disposable income to contribute. Alas.
awesome destruction sequence there
pop goes the titan
08,01Alchemist: as much as possible, really
08,01it's to pay for meds and transport to the hospital
there goes several hundred dollars of ship
If she is far from the needed amount I may be able to donate once more in a month.
hah
Ironic
That couch
Spaced.
Im going to assume that is impressive by their standards
Space
thats a damn badger not a calipso
its just a hauler
space couch is not amused?
at least use a logistics ship
So in eve... do they not have sheilds or something? How could that couch even hit that glass let alone break it.
Barbetos there is shield armour and hull
I mean.. Is taht even really glass?
but no shields was convenient for the scene
Chrysalis: It's scary how much you know about Eve... Impressive really.
Zuxxez123 i did play for 2 years
and only paid for 2 months of that
What in the name of god are we watching on the sream
*stream

And why did it have MCR in it.

XD
Midnight_Stormwing: You fool! XD
i forgot about that script
how does one use color?
Well, that happened.
Kurra: One doesn't. One gets kicked if one does. :p
Kurra: Depends on what client you're using.
It's not recommended though, only mods can use color.
I know you get kicked, I just want to know how it's done.

Bronysith: Agreed.
I haven't read the whole thing, but supposedly there is some crazy stuff in there.

/me sigh :s
Kinixys: The early parts yes, but it kinda mellows out.
Well yeah, the old testament.
wait, when did we get all religious?
08,01Meanwhile: is it because of the irony of you crossdressing at teh weekends?
:D
this is getting insufferable. :<
If I read it some more I probably would have some good quotes.
08,01also, wow, who is this uber handsome gentleman dancing with Discord? https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/266434_10151086387567409_589458488_o.jpg
Actually I just find it funny that women who wear trousers are considered evil by those standards.
11,01Meanwhile was in a dress?

such a lovely way to start the morning :3

AJIsAwesome: my record is 75 tabs
oh
twilight_sprinkle: WHAT?! :D
#paintchat
kirz|art: Hmm? What do you mean?
Well, did not mean to hog your attention, but my sister had a fainting spell today.
AJIsAwesome: yah :P i had two windows open though
Okay. :D
which would you fall under for your area
Hello there Iwanabethatguy. :3
ok thank you for telling me
Polydunami: Oh dear, she alright?
Polydunami: That sucks.
trying to check for known outages
Polydunami: She feeling better.
*?
What?
Your sister a Unicorn?
Polydunami yikes. She alright?
Polydunami: is she alright?
She's better; we thought it was serious so she is at the hospital right now.
....
Okay.
o
Hope everything goes better.
Good
A fainting spell?
Polydunami: I wish her the best. I'm sure she is in good hands. :3
^
Polydunami: hope she gets well
DerpyMuffins she passed out
Albany I guess.
he's trolling u DepyMuffins
She will, everypony.
*derpymuffins
sonicdude558: How is he trolling? :S
It's not as serious as we had thought.
nah
not him
Polydunami: what caused it?
Stress most likely
....
Polydunami was for a second
brb
Diabeties?
I've never fainted before. Wonder what that feels like.
05gona fix that properly later
Too much ponies?
sonicdude558: That's not somehting you joke around with.
05but it gives a rough of what it'll look
ooooooooook
It looks very nice, Wrek. :)
Nice :3
One of our friends is a piercing artist. She had some kind of a panic reaction to the needle.
Still think the expressions should be swapped.
Ah.
oh wow
I would be scared too
Wrek: I think it looks great. Would you mind giving me a lesson on how to do that good? :P
Ive still got a speech to finalize x.x
It looks so lifelike
Wrek needs to make a "How to use Paint Tool SAI" playlist.
No worries, however. It's all good.
It would be very helpful.
not seeing anything
AJIsAwesome it's kinda like falling asleep, except it's sudden instead of gradual. Scared the crap outta me when I did. One moment I was walking down the hall, the next I was on the couch with a numb face
I'm considering becoming an artist if college doesn't take over my life.
Is Paint Tool as lightweight as Paint.NET?
but I'd say give them a call to make sure, not everything makes it onto the websites
AJIsAwesome: i almost fainted once after blood was taken out of vein, although a doctor sprinkled me with a bit of cold water and i snapped out of it. it sort of goes dark slowly, you feel badly, obviously, and then fall asleep
Ill try that, thanks kirz
Wow. That's very intersting.
Nice to know. Thanks. :)
ouch, twilight_sprinkle
hiya AJ :D
Hiya, Queen_Chrysalis :D
sonicdude558: yeah it wasnt fun, but it couldve been worse
Sudden sleep, to put it bluntly AJsAwesome
sorry there's not much we can do, but if it's a few different people on the same network and it's not the router/modem, then it's probably the isp :(
DerpyMuffins: Wow. That's.....very shocking.
What was that
anyways
I heard a ping
sounds like Sumica just connected to wrek's stream
/me kicks at the ground
fun
Why hello, Queen_Chrysalis. Don't turn us into changelings now! :)
hoi Queen_Chrysalis
What isp do You use?
sonicdude558: doesn't work like that you know
hi Queen_Chrysalis :)
unless i'm thinking a different sound when he joins on planetside
embarq, it's a dsl service
o
Ah
silly me
ShizukaXVioletVanilla: OTP
OTP?
otakon x the kitchen sink. OTP.
I almost blacked out by standing up. I was sitting on the couch and then stood up. Everything went black and I felt light-headed, like someone was squeezing my head. I stumbled around, knocked over a few things, and came to a few seconds later. Scary as hell
One true pairing, AJIsAwesome
One True Pairing
Okay.
Meanwhile: no
otakon: yeees.
I need to stop typing essays . . .

Anyway, I feel hungry.
Thanks for the stream Wrek

Lunar_Brony: I don't remember :'(

DAMMIT

otakon: The SFM or the gmod one?
brb
curse my lousy short term memory
AJIsAwesome: it was SFM I think
h.
Oh.
/me pats otakon's head. "It's okay, we all have those moments."
What have you revealed to us Bronysith? :D
Is that from a video game?
do you know if the issue is just your house, or if neighbors are having the same issue?
Bronysith WTF am I listening to?
Wrek: DO you mind linking that one MvM video with Pinkie and the Scout?
THAT'S IT!
Dont eat the cupcqkes
/me slaps AJIsAwesome over in enthusiasm
http://i.imgur.com/cugSU.jpg
What's wrong withcupcakes?
Pinkie Pie
AHAHAHAHAH
You mean that overrated fic that needs to die?
AJIsAwesome you don't want to knwo
There is nothing wrong with cupcakes. They are great, with just a little dash of rainbow to it. MMmmmm...
I still eat cupcakes to this day. Cupcakes doesn't scare me one bit.
Im not sure. Dont really talk to my neighbors, lol. They change so often (I live in an anpartment).
AJIsAwesome: That's the one. Lol. I didn't think it was good either, but it's fun to mess with other people. :3
I check my cupcakes everytime I eat one now
05there we go
05its 2am
05good night
what people need to realize is... GORE does not mean SCARY
I don't know
Oh sh*t you exorcist
Night.
05hope ya liked
Scary doesnt mean gore
I don't think so
Night Wrek.
Good night Wrek.
Good night, Wrek.
Cya Wrek
g'night Wrek
Scary would be psycological
Goodnight Wrek!~
Bronysith: EXACTLY.
that makes you shit your pants
Wrek: thanks again man, sleep well
brb guys
Bye Wrek.
Plus 'They' use the internet given to them with the apartment. My family has our own router and such.
Cupcakes was more of a Saw kind of scary. And by scary, they mean gory, stupidly gory.
At least Cupcakes didn't have SAW's plot, all over the place calling back to things everyone forgot happened.
cupcakes is not scary
just gorey as all balls
^
Bronysith: eeyup.
And gore doesn't justify as scary, IMO.
now scary would be Silence of the lambs
balls aren't gory
AJIsAwesome: Amen to that.
the thought of someone getting into your head....ugh
most of the time the isp is the same, cable providers in most places have a monopoly
^
I WILL NOTVE TURNED INTO CUPCAKES
Mhhm.
What?
like since you have TW, everyone in the building will have TW
Bronysith: THAT is a psycological movie.
psycological is scary
^
05time for porn
the only way to be scary is psycological
Psychological, you mean?
Wrek: .......
I have sith on ignore, what movie was that?
05i mean Superbrony64*
Wrek: gorey ponr?!
Meanwhile: Silence of The Lammbs.
*Lambs
It could be flash in toop of that too.
Wrek you have rendered me speechless.
Ah, fava beans and chianti.
could always check with the landlord if you're on good terms, if they even use the internet
NOONE WILL TURN ME INTO CUPCAKES
oh that movie wasnt that scary
11,01The earlier Saws were more psychological. The later ones became torture porn.
yup
Nittany_Discord - isn't that how most gimmicky movie series turn out?
Rainbow_Lunar: No offense, but are you still going on with this?
Meanwhile: High five for reference?
the first one is typically good / great, the second is meh, and 3+ are just gimmick porn
SAW is not scary...to the people who go through those games it would be scary though
Zuxxez123: (\
Human Centipede was just a stupid gore movie.
back
WB
Meanwhile: /)
...
Human Centipede for B movie.

Jumpscares are not scary

I can admit to not cheating in college, since that's idiotic to do. >_>
11,02Though, in my Economics final, I took so long that I was the last one in the room for the test and my professor just left saying to drop off the test in his office...didn't cheat then :I

Keep clicking the featured videos! See where it takes us. <<
Yay
Dark_Horst: me too XD

There is an organization in Britian, JUST for not using used condoms. Love it. :3

Zuxxez123: omg XD
Ads, on youtube? it's been so long
this
you know what. screw the neather
roamin
screw gold
Buytoast, he talked about how he used cheat in grade school, but when he went to college, he decided to stop cheating. And he became distraught at the people who continued to cheat.
nah, captainsparklez version is better
gold is worth a good bit of ecm
DashWithRainbows: Ahhhhhhhhhh ya got me
taoumi: rehtaen eht wercs ,tahw wonk uoy
what's the point of Gold in Minecraft?
I know I would.
Because I'm your dealer :P

lowfn: wat?
for show? otakon
Jonathan Frakes?
gold is use full
rails
the only thing

otakon: gold tools are faster
taoumi: Type what I typed backwards
:P
they decay like fuck, but they are faster
Dark_Horst: really? but don't they break faster too?
otakon: yup
haaa
is emerald currency iirc?
Dken2021: Something like that.
so? he's still denouncing something he practically worshipped in his earlier videos
best part coming now
Buytoast, he outgrew it.
Honeydew.
i wish i knew a good tekkit server
I hate the Nether. Ghasts are creepy.
i doubt someone like that would outgrow anything he did as a child
Riker. You're screwed.

BULLERTS
Yes.
>Wii U
I want a Wii U D:
um hello everyone *tries to avoid eye contact with Meanwhile*
pls go
Buytoast, he changed his mind on cheating. That's not hypocracy. Hypocracy is gladly participating in activity that he claims to disapprove.
Amen dari.
lol
11,0249 days \;3/
yay, a trailer that shows nothing of the actual game
/me stares at flutterchu.
Not a lot of gameplay in that.
and that casued the shitstorm?
NewSuperBronyU: it is NOT that goddamn good
08,01i wish i had long, pretty legs...
08,01and boobs
Dark_Horst: And this is new?
/me stares at flutterchu also
Bobeh: look at Bayonetta for gameplay
*hides behind mane*
NewSuperBronyU: are you getting the more expensive one?
he was gladly participating i his earlier years and tehndecided to act all righteous and sell out others who were doing what he was doing
11,02otakon: Oh come on, I'm getting Skylanders Giants for it, I know how much you like that one.
I smell NewSuperBronyU

THERE IS NOTHING NEW ABOUT THIS MARIO BROS. GAME!
/me noms on SaxyPretender
0,14oh hai kirz|art
Thatssssssss some nice controls you got there...
otakon: as opposed to the last hundred?
11,02oni_link: Ofc, $50 extra for charging cradle, Gamepad stand, Console stand, more memory, AND Nintendo Land? Heck yeah.
:3
Dark_Horst: mostly because it's a Wii U sequel
otakon: shut it! theyre fun, and thats what matters.
Nintendo's philosophy is "It can never have enough screens."
some of my keys r stuck cause i accidently dropped my laptop :T
Meanwhile: no I mean EXACTLY like the others
you know
otakon: Yea there is something new its major... toads follow you now
0,14so guess who went to their first concert yesterday?
these are cool and all but
Sometimes
lowfn: unlike the other one?
NewSuperBronyU: I gotta reserve mine still >.>
who'd you see?
I Need a new atmosphere for mario
Nintendo's philosophy is "Well why CAN'T we just release the same damn thing every year?"
different enemy design
0,14Foo Fighters, Black Keys and Neil Young
people were fucking angry that its wii exclusive, while totally not caring about the fact that if the exclusiveness was a condition to get the job of developing it
11,02oni_link: Hurry up though, most places are sold out of it already D:
cool
different enemies altogether
if they had said no, there wouldnt be a sequel at all
different feel
Meanwhile: You mean the philosophy also employed by Call of Duty?
0,14went pretty much for the Foos, but everything else was great
so... the Wii U
Anymore now it just feels like nintend releases stuff that tests its hardware, but damn is it ever fun.
NewSuperBronyU: dang thanks for the heads up :o
CrimsonPhoenix: DKC Returns did that and people flipped their lid about that.
CriticKitten: God I hate Call of Duty.
that's why people hate mario
Uh, this is just New Super Mario Brothers Wii
08,01NewSuperBronyU: i'd rather spend $50 on lots of candles and chemicals
CriticKitten: lol
I dunno how many hours I put into wii boxing.
0,14...aside from the weed smokers and douchebags, but that's to be expected, really
lol
11,02Oh wow, they're sold out of the Basic set now too
>Chemicals
so which one were you? ;p
NewSuperBronyU: oh gawd no D:
He doesn't do drugs.
NOPENOPENOPE
So douchebag.
then they asked if the people wpuld have prefered it not coming out at all to it being exclusive. and guess wjhat, people said YEAH! WII DOESNT DESERVE BAJONETTA
AJIsAwesome, do you even want to know?
0,14>.>
08,01AJIsAwesome: have you ever lit 1,000 candles at the same time?
<3
08,01it's pretty cool
makes sense
how is it sold out if it's just pre order?
11,02I want dis game :D
i'd spend $50 on a wonderbolt hoodie;)
ASoftFluffyThing: I already do. ;)
it'S a whole truckload of dumbfuckery
ZombieU?
Tab fail
Bitches, get your tabs right
NewSuperBronyU, no you don't
I'd spend 50 dollars on gas and new headphones
NewSuperBronyU: NO
0,14but yeah, it was great
NewSuperBronyU: DO NOT BUY THAT GODDAMN GAME
No srsly. I don't even care honestly. You wanna say "every Mario is the same" and "every Zelda is the same", I dun care. I ain't even mad. Because I know a lot of those same kids are going out and buying Medal of Modern Warfare: Halo Edition every single year, so I just laugh at them now.
08,01also, candles are good for candleplay... >.>
>Wii
NewSuperBronyU: PLEASE!
black ops 2, Im getting it for 360 because thats the only thing my friends are going to be playing.
>Black Ops II
Hey Saxy.

Seen the footage from the Canterlot Gardens tourney?
Wii U**
0,14some of it
0,14saw part of grand finals
otakon:if you were a game i wouldnt buy you either
whats up babe?
Buytoast, he was proud of how masterfully he cheated, but he doesn't advocate others cheating.
Wii U is actually a waste of time money and effort.
:o
RAWR!
i thought everyone here liked the wii u :(
0,14game's looking neat
otakon: It could be the most powerful thing in the world, it's still a shitty design
Wait, who's streaming?
Meanwhile but....screen on the controller D:
I know Wrek was about an hour ago when I was on my phone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5TXyJlEMc
Dken2021: Wooooow that's fucking amaaaaazing.
Wii U seems more like a glorified DS to me.
NewSuperBronyU: the new control is gonna take some getting used to for me at least
Playing on the GamePad will be a pain in the ass in my opinion.
forza horizon ftw
08,01ASoftFluffyThing: so long as you use the right type of candle, it's relatively sage
I have yet to see RD yet, I'll admit.
lowfn, same here
zzzzzz
amen lowfn thats why i want one :)
lowtn: im with u
>can't hit anything
I don't mind the Wii U. I honestly couldn't care.
Lul
i cant get over how it looks like an oversized gameboy advance. then again, i never cared much for consoles
I hear she's either broken, underpowered, or both.
0,14considering switching main to RD, her offensive pressure looks fun
You could theoretically do some cool stuff with this, but they won't, because they're Nintendo.
ima earn my $50 if i wake up befor emy dad :T
0,14ignore that for now, game's not even finished
lol was that a wii u remote he pulled out to control the dron in the game XD
All they'll do is make what they've been making for the past decade.
'Course.
oni_link: maybe
11,02princess|on: Lol, you can do it :D
I might play her because her movelist is short and easy to remember.
ik :P
did he just say they're "introducing" Create-A-Class?
Leverage.
Built around outmaneouvring the rest of the cast, if I'm seeing things correctly.
0,14dunno if that move list is finished
And then chat went into Nintendo discussion
sadly i woke up at 5:30 before anyone else on a weekend
I want AC3 for the Wii U
I'm back . . . CoD . . .
wow.... these guys aim SLOWLY!
ASoftFluffyThing: IKR? :D
0,14don't see anythng that looks like her flip kick
ello Lunar_Brony
I'm gonna wait until I see what they end up implementing. It's actually a cool design IF you implement it smartly, but....remains to be seen if they'll actually do it, so yeah, holding onto my money for now.
Whatever controller you're using, you still wasted your money on a bad game.
AJIsAwesome, Mmmhmmm
cause i had a dusturbing but yet fun dream :U
>not for novelty
and that, children, is why you play shooters with a mouse
"Flip kick"?
Suuuuuuuuuuuure

CriticKitten: Waheeeeey
I want fatal frame on Wii U
that gives advantage to the one using the controller
I dont care, Im getting that Wii U darn it! not for COD but for the first party releases (and AC3) I want a new HD Zelda and F-Zero
11,02I like games that make me happy and not what everypony else thinks of it.
Meanwhile: but im not a video game ;_;
you just dont play shooters with analog-sticks. that's like wacking a retarded child with a dead cat. you just dont do it
NewSuperBronyU: me too! /)
More power to you Super, you still have horrible taste.
NewSuperBronyU - agreed. Which is why one of these days i'm going to play Skyrim and give myself all the spells before i'm even out of Helgan
Dark_Horst I take it you play FPS on PCs?
That's looking sweet kirz.
Who's streaming?
NewSuperBronyU:same
yup. grew up with battlefield
I'll wait and see on new Zelda, myself. I ended up getting both TP and SS because they both made some great steps forward. But I sort of expect the next Zelda to take steps backwards now, it's Nintendo's pattern. :.
Welcome back Lunar_Brony, NewSuperBronyU is streaming
SKIP IT!

darnit NewSuperBronyU, stay on one thing!
05HURR HURR
that ad makes no sense
/me is laying the smackdown
CriticKitten: me too
Okay, the sports thing is actually sort of cool.
11,02Lyra`: D:
Wrek, http://derpy.me/qfOct XD
brb my friend is forceing me to play at the gala sparta remix :|
I could see you playing Madden, using the touchpad as a playbook.
dat kart racing :3
Winner wasn't even in the room
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb6weuBSAP1rxzaoho1_1280.png dang it Pumpkin cake is such a bitch
You can play as a caddy. That's... actually, kind of brilliant.
I find that amusing
0,14ah
I don't have an opinion on the Wii U yet. I'll wait to see how they'll implement the control scheme for games, then I'll make one.
i'm still waiting for the day someone makes a cross-platform shooter that actually pitches consoles vs PCs
05gotta love yahtzee AdamTheDuck :D
Ok so basically what this advert is for is to remind you that they do not in fact have original ideas in Nintendo
that would settle this age old conflict once and for all^^
05which vid was that from now again?
with global scores
this is what i think of the wii:|
not the same pony, just to get a sense of the difference :P
Meanwhile: Originality is dead.
PC is still better for FPS
CriticKitten: Sadly.
May as well give up on it.
CrimsonPhoenix I imagine their voices are like phil and lil
EVOLUTION
go nintendo style
The proof of that? Sony All Stars.
Dark_Horst: kinda like shadowrun?
Wrek, can't remember, it's been a while since I watched anything from him :/
05fps works so well on PC due to the accurate controls
lol
Almost makes me want to draw more.
Aaaaaaalmost
05you dont need to have aim assist to have a chance at snipign someones head
lol
^
oni_link: thought that was a bookseries
lol
You don't need aim assist with dual analog either
"Hey guys, we herd u lyke SSB, so we gun make a shitty ripoff with a terrible roster so we can steal your money lul"
For the moment though, my current goal is to finish this first chapter of the TWIGROPE SAGA
that is why TF2 will never succeed on consoles
05if consoles could provide that kind of control over ones char, i wouldnt mind fps on consoles as much
And then send it off to otakon.
I'm sure Shizuka does
Mouse usually has lower top sensitivity than dual analog IMO
I want a joystick for movement in PC
CriticKitten but.....they have combos D:
13<3
Wrek: stick a mouse in an usb port
That looks...creepy.
0,14hehe, I do
Well I always play top sensitivity on FPS games
> lewd connotations
was a crazy night Meanwhile :)
Like that one creepy pasta with the handbag doll.
On PC or console, and it's never 'too fast'
Lunar_Brony: it hasnt, lobbys are dead. no hats, or weapons, or sprays or anything. its a vanilla TF2 with no plans to change it.
oni_link O______O
PC FTW
screw 360
otakon: Then you don't play enough
05when scoped i have very low sensitivity, otehrwise i got high sensitivity so i can actualyl turn aroudn before i die when shot in the back
Lunar_Brony: I own the Orange Box on 360, never again.
You get used to it after a little time
11,02Poniez...
11,02Poniez plz...
11,02Wii U wins, why are we even arguing this?
NewSuperBronyU: what are you on about?
05this argumetn is your fault SB :o
Aaaaand as soon as I drop in chat, I'm leaving again. Night everyone.
Yeah this is your fault Super, why would you do this?
lol NewSuperBronyU XD Wii U master race
NewSuperBronyU because the WiiU has not yet been released
Hooray for VG butthurt in mane.
11,01Problem is, Microsoft and Valve may never settle their differences about DLC policies.
yeah that
11,02Lunar_Brony: 49 days \:3/
AND I CAN'T HAVE IT
cuz I'm broke
NewSuperBronyU: you pitch em on the table all the time, now watch the kitchen burn
0,14yeah, I'm staying out of that
11,01At least for TF2.
You'd get flattened.
11,01With L4D2, Valve had to charge for the DLC.
Honestly, the console is cool. But the question remains whether or not it'll be used well. *shrug* I'm holding out until I know for sure.
Nittany_Discord: Thats microsoft for ya. >.>
CrimsonPhoenix: Same here.
0,14well, i generally dislike arguments/debates/discussion/deep thinking
lol
*CriticKitten
that's screwed up

NewSuperBronyU: What? I heard it was good. :S

Meanwhile: its like bronysith!

Shammy: Oh wow it is.
NewSuperBronyU: that bad? or just execs fucking stuff up again?
MvM anyone ?
oh this that guy that tries out awful store brand food?
windows 8 is crap
kirz|art: how so?
I feel like just dropping in and yelling "HEY ASSHOLES, THEY'RE JUST GAMES" but I'd just get ignored.
Shammy: You've figured out the mystery.
11,02"Currently the show is officially on hiatus.[7]"
I might drop into that game.
kirz|art I'm guessing you use it then. How different is it from 7?
Ha, wow.
Meanwhile: Bronsith is snarf?
whooo!
HIATUS!
Shammy: Indeed.
That's a shame since it was actually decent.
NOT CANCELLED
if you don't like it, prove to me why it's so bad, hmm?
You know what show I miss? Symbionic Titan. :|
0,14also, kirz dropping bombs in mane XD
HIATUS =/= CANCELLED! YAY!

otakon: Duke Nukem Forever was on hiatus.
And they're now showing reruns on Toonami
AJIsAwesome: me too
Whoa, 36 upvotes on one of my posts on Reddit

11,02I hate the Thundercats.
kirz|art: im scared of change >.>
CriticKitten: but THAT came out
its a show for little boys, it couldnt possibly be good.
NewSuperBronyU: HOW?
i saw the intro on youtube and some scenes from the first ep. it didnt look bad to me
AJIsAwesome: It's on Toonami now
I had mane closed what did he do
NewSuperBronyU: New or old.

I have never watched Thundercats, so I have no opinion on the show. Sue me
ARE YOU OKAY?
'Thunderony" :D
I'm sure hiding in here passively complaining about the gaming discussion is much better. :P
/me is drawing parallels :3
0,14BUSTAH WOLF

11,02Lyra`: Yay :3
Lyra`: just give it a shot PLEASE the new show is pretty good actually
Lyra`, that's some nice pasta there

Well look at it this way. At least we're not those guys.
I want some thunderony
AJIsAwesome: 2 AM6_9
the shite black one
0,14...in all seriously, I have developed the compulsion to yell out BUSTAH WOLF, if I hear "Are you okay?"
No1 cares about the stupid new thundercats
J_E_Smith71: SERIOUSLY? :S
No, you're those guys without enough commitment to contribute.
Pink3: I do. I like it. :S
:P
Thunderony. Is that like Beefaroni? What does it taste like?
Sry
Sly
CrimsonPhoenix: and for breakfast the next day, some zapapple jam on toast on the side XD
No, we're the guys who can't give a rat's ass about contributing.
I hated the old Thundercats. The new thundercats actually made me like the series again.
0,14^

i could contribute i don't feel like it
Also, I have experiments to do.
Hey Saxy. Are you okay?

Ive never played any of the oddworld games, they look interesting
When I'm Muffin!
RIP EDD

The uninspired and mediocre.
Had that discussion already.
0,14I do.
oni_link: puzzle platformers
See?
lol
0,14Only have $20 for Halo 4 ;___;
otakon: me gusta
oni_link: well except for Stranger's Wrath which was AWESOME
honestly, the Halo series is the only thing I considered buying an xbox for
which is why I bought a ps3
oni_link: FPS/TPS adventure game with a good story and interesting locales
0,14ba dum psh
SaxyPretender for ya http://derpy.me/W9bO4
also got HARD
0,14XD
403, Trix.
otakon: yeah strangers wrath was the one with the critter crossbow right?
I hold Halo responsible for the negative trends in fps gaming nowadays.
yeah, premium. fuck EA
oni_link: eeyup
RIP Battlefield, you killed it EA.
11,01I saw Halo4 SP footage, and I wasn't really impressed by it.
Reikim internet is not compatible with otanet
>have your own real eastate on your gamepad
A plague upon it's house.
0,14yeah, yeah, repetative and shit
GIVE US ANIMAL CROSSING!
I hold 12yo's responsible for that Meanwhile
What is this bullshit he is speaking?
bbboooooooooo wiiU
otakon: they released it on steam :o
mario chase?
really?
Twelve year olds aren't the ones who built it.
REALLY!?
and who the fuck is supposed to buy that?
I hold idiot consumers and the publishers that feed them responsible.
wy did they call it wi u when they havnt named any of their consoles after another.. ever
but they're the ones shelling out the money and bitching about it
Meanwhile i hold CoD
FUCKING REALLY!? INSTEAD OF GO KARTS YOU GET TO RUN AFTER EVERYBODY
that'S the nkind of game people play when there'S mario on the cover
BUT THERE ISNT
otakon: yeah
Metroid Blast
11,01I have to blame CoD.
/me kills the arguement before it hits the "this is why EA is bad" point
looks a bit interesting
0,14^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
take it to mane :P
Health regen, space marines, the desire to tack on multiplayer, ironsights.
oh
11,01I'm done with EA hate forever. It does no good.
was taht?
it's ALL mini games
-.-
WAS THAT!?!!?!
otakon: search for Strangers Wrath HD
it's a mini game Game
on steam
PIKMIN 3?!?!
oni_link: yeah I know
nintendo land. we can watch that get moldy in the shelves
0,14okay, minor nitpick, but Halo doesn't have ironsights
Lyra` eeyup
Lyra`: no that was mini game pikmin
._.
oh
OH FUCK YOU!
My personal favourite is the whole "add multiplayer to it" trend.
11,01That's just because that's what sells Meanwhile.
nevermind
SaxyPretender yet
Wii U EXCLUSIVE weapon
Oh, fuck everything.
No, it's because that's what sold.
0,14XD
11,02Lyra`: Oh yeah, they announced Pikmin 3 :)
otakon: Wasn't MArio Party a mini game game?
Dark_Horst: Er, you do realize that the Wii's top selling game was Wii Sports, right?
WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN MAPS!
11,02I'll show the trailer after this ;3
Also health regen was, I believe, pioneered by CoD.
FUCK YOU EA YOU FUCKING BASTARDS!
d-d-d-double kick
WE SHOULD HAVE HAD MAPS! AND RADAR!
(You sent 7 messages in 10 seconds.) otakon XD
And that's top selling, as in "people actually bought the game individually, not counting bundle sales"
CriticKitten: welp, mankind is fucked
If Halo hadn't done as well as it did then those wouldn't have become the staple.
http://lolpics.se/pics/7735.jpg
And we wouldn't be where we are.
11,02YEAH FUCK THEM FOR BRINGING GAMES TO OTHER CONSOLES, HOW DARE THEY
but this here has to be a joke
11,01I do hate forced MP, but people sometimes complain when it's not there.
0,14man, there's so much butthurt in here
NewSuperBronyU: IKR? :S
0,14it's like everyone sat on tacks
it's delicious
I wanna try NintendoLand
13yep... not going to bother streaming tonight..
lol TheGreatAndPowerfulT
NewSuperBronyU: no fuck them for taking shit out of the game that was done in the original and then PUTTING IT BACK IN afterwards ON A PORT
Because nobody is capable of enjoying a good single-player campaign anymore.
Shizu: D:
0,14and those tacks were covered in lemon juice and salt
^
ME1 had maps
and radar
Reikim talk to yourself
^^
11,01And MP lets some publishers attach online passes (oh joy! </sarcasm>)
Everything is about multiplayer now.
0,14and that salt came from babies punched in the face
Shizuka: how come?
ME2 and ME3 did NOT
Whuzzat Trix?
ME3 is weak anyway
Shizuka, you're not going to stream any glorious music today? :<
SaxyPretender: With a little bit of rust on the nails, too.
13nope
i enjoy singleplayer over MP
CrimsonPhoenix: true but still it's a slap in the face
Never though I see ME3 on the Wii
Oh well.
13even had something special
0,14A /little/ bit of rust?
0,14pfft
aww damn
13but there's too much complaining
That's a pitty...
11,02Pikmin 3 \:3/
;-;
I blame otakon
shizuka pls :<
05tell me about it shizu
Shizuka: no no PLEASE stream it's just me about the superior Wii U port of ME3
my gaming list says so
I agree with TheGreatAndPowerfulT, it's much nicer to have a solo jerk than a circle jerk
You know what I was saying applied only to a general representation of the popular gaming world today.
>.>
11,01Just game chat Shizuka. Gaming chat is ripe with complaining.
More Pikmin. Wooo. sarcastic face.
Shizuka: it's JUST me please stream ;_;
Shizuka: I think it would be okay if it's not more gaming stuff.
05theres always a few that jsut cant stop whining about the free content :|
/me is sitting back, enjoying the butthurt.
Yay this game
<3
<3 <3 <3
This game; one of the biggest reasons I am getting WiiU.
so much WUB!
Shizuka: nah, turn in early. save yourself the trouble.
the one thingi really minded about ME3 was the ending.... gameplay.... well, they kinda blunted it a lot
rock men?!?!
yeah
rock pikmin
0,14but yeah, what I mean to say is that there's a whole lot of kvetching
like, really, BLUNTED it.... but it worked
Trix, is that MvM still going?
SaxyPretender, kvetching?
haven't started only you responded
whining, bitching, etc
Wrek: it's not about free content it's having a working map and radar in a game that was taken out originally then put back in afterwards. It's like buying a car and then going back and finding out just after you bought that car a better version came out for the exact same price the next day.
0,14Kvetching is Yid-
It means bitching.
rock music
0,14dammit, kirz
So anyone else willing to get in on this?
Damn multiple dudes controlling the pikmin
YES
SaxyPretender: welp, i learned a new word today
Eh, maybe.
Can't wait for this game.
That's all I was raging about on ME3
so why are we just watching youtubes?
ninja :3
RoboGerbil: bc we are
like we cant watch youtubes on our own?
RoboGerbil: Because.
Actually I should go bug otakon.
RoboGerbil, because Wii U
This game is art

otakon. MvM?
NewSuperBronyU: can you show the Black Betty one please?
Finally made it back
Reikim: to play atm? no thanks

Never could get into Rayman until Origins.

11,01I can't wait until we outright cure depression and anxiety and maybe even conquer fear.
Nittany_Discord: we'd have cocky people world wide
oni_link: interesting point
So who else?
DWR's playing already, he might be up for a swapover.
11,01We wouldn't have problems with phobias and anxiety disorders.
as far as the fea part goes, we should find a cure for depression and anxiety though
*fear

Hm?
11,01Fear is my #1 enemy, so I would like to see it dead.

Ladies?
Like Tara Strong? :trollface:

Tara Strong is best Twilight
yea, sure, you're cool, whatever
Zuxxez123: Tf2 gamers are like that most the time
kirz|art: Love the art :o what program do you use??
Or calling hax.
fun fact
lol
>Sniping someone? Hax.
GG can be seen as an insult in some games
sai
"Grandma's a wig", "Finish our homework" What?
Damn.... everyone has sai....
CrimsonPhoenix: really, which ones?
I need it
>Shooting someone near the middle/lower body? Noob
you can find a free version
oni_link: Yeah, I'm aware. At least on RTS games (Starcraft 2 is my instance) people normally say GG or GL-HF(Good Luck Have Fun) before the game.
League of Legends mainly
I already used the trial :D
Is it wrong that Im rooting for Derpy to win?
CrimsonPhoenix: What would GG mean in that game?
dota 2 came out yesterday btw
AJIsAwesome: lol yeah, you dont go for headshots, youre a noob apparantly
there's another spot with the free one
it's Good game
DerpyMuffins: No, I am doing the same. :P
oni_link: IKR, :S
welp guys I hate to say it
Zuxxez123: ti would enjoy that.
but League of Legends is like torture if you're losing
I gotta go I'm being forced off my PC

O.o
bbl, playing tf2 :P
I will be forced off pc soon

twilight_sprinkle, exactly
There are places you can find the free version.
Also: otanet SUCKS.
except LoL are prebubescent morons who THINKS they're good
my life was empty then i met ponys and then seesion 2 ended now im empty again
:\
gg
11,02gg :)
actually...same goes for HoN
Time to go try and fix that.
Dota MAYBE less
11,02Last match :D
if you play on russian dota servers, everyone knows your mother
therainbowvortex: you wont be empty for long
But 'free' do you mean pirated? :I
twilight_sprinkle: lol wut
Meh. I actually managed to get interested in other shows and series ever since Season 2 ended.
No.
oni_link: their insults always involve it :P
Oh cool, is it on the site?
twilight_sprinkle: what what the hell are you talking about
I mean illicitly gained through semi-shady means that skirt the borders of illegality and are largely untraceable by the authorities.
I've been watching breaking bad from start to end of season 3 right now
twilight_sprinkle: lol oh yeah, same for kids on COD (for consoles at least)
Lol.....
Id like to legit have it :D
I do not care for COD
AJIsAwesome: Ive been watching Dr. Who :P I love it. CGI is still a little cheesy for me but I love the show as a whole
Look at it like Photoshop.
I've yet to watch Breaking Bad.
I hear it's really good.
therainbowvortex, if you feel empty because of the lack of NEW pony episode then you need to re-evaluate your life
AJIsAwesome: everyone tells me to watch that show too XD
Who do you think actually buys that for six hundred dollars?
AJIsAwesome: Same here, it's on Netflix if you have that.
If i wasnt worried about pirating, I would have Photoshop and be making a desktop pony for myself.
You don't need Photoshop :/
OKay. Thanks. :)
this sucks I wanted to see Shizuka stream
wow charizard sucks
Personally, I use GraphicsGale for spriting. Hell, it's practically built for it.
oh lol
oh yea, it has Bryan Cranston, which I never though he do a serious role since he was Hal on malcolm in the middle
twilight_sprinkle: If you don't know how to use him.
gg
11,02gg :)
wow
what a delay
lolwat
Build a spritesheet, port into some sort of GIF creator, PROFIT
twilight_sprinkle: I was brutally destroyed by someone using Hcarizard.
*Charizard
AJIsAwesome: eh, ive never played that game tbh
needs more fox
and less items
Photoshop is really overkill if you're just making a desktop pony.
that fucking wario map always ruins the session for me
twilight_sprinkle: Oh, okay. You're not really missing out.
and now, darkness
good stream
And if you really want a good, free Photoshopp clone, look no further than GIMP.
AJIsAwesome: really? looks kinda fun, minus the imbalanced characters
twilight_sprinkle, that's the point
The buffer show
where's kingdom hearts when you need it?
there's no balance for a reason
twilight_sprinkle: I guess. It's more online battles than anything for me.
Wheres Tara Strong when you need her?
it insult the tourney aspect of the game
:3
CrimsonPhoenix: wait a sec hat was an insalt
Brawl?
Yes
Photoshop is for...well, shopping photos, and high-end digital artwork.
Meh. Do to what ive seen, i desperately want SAI
Broken character
Tripping
*Due
items
hazards
Lol
Torrents are magic.
Just about to fix that, but thanks :P
nnn brb
Is someone really going to defend that SSB is a perfect series with no flaws?
I still like the game, not as much as Melee or Smash.
i will :3
Zuxxez123: Oh, no.
It's got flaws.
brawl can be competive, if you use Brawl+
or vanilla
I usually go back to Brawl for online matches.
Dken2021, lolbrawl+
Either than that, nothing else.
I have never herd of this "Brawl+", what is it
Dken2021, what's Vanilla?
CrimsonPhoenix just the basic game
with items?
CrimsonPhoenix: stock
and level hazards?
also no sound
haha
to streamer
Dken2021: I cant find a good ISO for brawl+
can't believe that sick bastard isn't in jail yet
i have sound
so im on vanilla
11,02There is sound though o.o
I hear it NewSuperBronyU
i have sound
I have sound too
i have sound
oh wow
Sound is a go. :3
it's very low
sonicdude558, it's a mod for brawl, changing codes so it feels more like melee
ok
The only thing i have torrented is the 'Derpy' version of 'The Last Roundup'
bk
burger king
Dat Castlevania Reference.
even melee shouldn't have been tourney
My friend legit bought me the rest of the seasons :D
cause let's be honest
I plan on buying the set when it hits dvd
what did you need to remove to actually make it competitive?
Melee isn't the perfect game, but I prefer it over the first and Brawl.
So was I, lol.
i still think the original is perfect
But my friend bet me he wouldnt get addicted to mlp if he watched the first 3 eps :D
I'm back. How much did I miss?
er
you missed Brawl
not that much
Lunar_Brony: wb, not much
Competive SSB game would have to remove all items probably.
AJIsAwesome: me too! Although i didnt like the dash glitches
>competitive
>SSB
CriticKitten: its a thing, yes
oni_link: True.
He lost, so I wasnt going to turn down the episodes :D
Sort of missing the point. :P
Although I LOVE powershielding in that game.
In fact, it was the CPU's that taught me it.
Zuxxez123, exactly
ello :3
removing half of the game to make it competitive
hi quicksilver52170
:3
XD
rllo quicksilver52170
hi quick >:P
:P
Hi, quicksilver52170 :)
ik him hes on my game on roleblox guys :3
Anyway, I need to take a nap. Later
hi quicksilver52170
ohai
aaaaand my vids and such still dont work :(
:3
Street Fighter is a good and way better game for competitive
g'night poly
gah
yeah don't bother asking him questions lol he wont answe ryou
stalking me eh silver? >:3
/me flips a table
if you see him again anyways
oyusiam
:3
this game makes me want to rage just looking at it
y?=/
twilight_sprinkle: I can see that. :D
oh hey is NewSuperBronyU still playing?
Yep
mmhmm
you know how to respond to ppl silver?
like this
=/
haha I'll keep that in mind
quicksilver52170: hi :3
twilight_sprinkle: I actually saw someone do a drunk attempt at this game. :D
LOL
AJIsAwesome: lol live?
XD
he's a very...strange breed of internet troll
CrimsonPhoenix: its just preference. SSB is a different type of fighter but it still has lots of competetions, its actually not as niche as you'd think
ssb?
oni_link, it's a horrible game for competition
it's a party game
stop giving me nostalgia from my childhood =/
even SAKURAI HIMSELF said that
What on earth is this game and what is that thing swimming around in the sludge?
11,02:D
anyone have a youtube?:P
Would appear to be a giant blood clot.
that was a close one
i should get dat on here but insted you used your so called AXE banned him somehow:[
quicksilver52170: never heard of it
Mozdoc, it's Super Meat Boy
poor meat blob :(
never heard of youtube?D:
oh god, natural light!
a sadistic plate-former
quicksilver52170: sarcasm xD
11,02:D
CrimsonPhoenix: Okay if he said that thats fine. But it still doesnt stop people from competing in it. It just goes to show how much people like it. If you make tourneys, they will come
who has never heard of youtube :D
:)
so cute :3
twilight_sprinkle: Nope. Recorded. But it was hilarious. :D
Super Smash Brothers.
/me will buy it if it comes with enlgish lenguage option
I still find SSBB tourneys to be horrible
AJIsAwesome: is it on youtube?
how does one even beta test this game?
What...did I come back to this time O_o
quicksilver52170: elders maybe
tsoboe no tsetsya dalshe...
they ain't even playing the actual game on how it's meant to be played
Cypresswolf: super meat boy
Welp, that about does it for me. Need some sleep.
because of how broken it is
he seemed a little weird the first time i met him :p
Night everyone.
that was creepy
g'night Meanwhile
night Meanwhile
silver you should really come on friday the last movie was epic
seeya Meanwhile
CrimsonPhoenix: how so?
night Meanwhile
CHAPTER COMPLETE!:D
Night, Mea- gone.
derp
back to art
oni_link, Meta-Knight, odds
0,14work them magics
you don't play with odds in a competition game
you guys know in a trailer theres a new Dc universe comeing out in 2014
it's meant to measure the player
Oh no, I can understand people wanting to compete in a game.
CrimsonPhoenix: yeah, you dont. hes OP same goes for several other characters, they were tailored for casuals.
But there are different forms of competition. Expecting a solid tournament fighter out of your party game is missing the point.
is that.... salt? o.o
Kurra: yeah
.__.
Kurra IKR?
o-oh... myy~
:) Ah, I love finishing off the last of the whiskey - strong enough for a slight hangover in the morning
im getting the small feeling that sombodys gonna start a 4chan thread like conversation
Kurra yup its also DEATH SODUIM liek soduim can kill us in real life
=/
quicksilver52170: they were eariler XD
soduim is basicly this acid and flooride i guess
oh god
>Not being 4chan
oni_link, see even you admit it's broken
>4channers invade
:o this game!
>derp
LOL
CrimsonPhoenix: Never said it wasn't
no game is to be honest
he just ran head fisrt into salt :P
guess what quicksilver52170
WHAT
then why can't meta-kknight be in the game?
is SB64 still streaming?
i exploded u XD
in the tourney even
eeyup
I think so
do not want 4chan here, thankyou
OneTrickPony: He is, yes.
derp?
i think he was mis interperted. he was making fun of the 4channers
was anybody scared of big mac in ponyville confedential?
Nope.
this game is insane
Just shocked.
CrimsonPhoenix: he can just not in tourneys.
oni_link, why not
he's in the game
so are items
why can't they be in tourneys?
oni_link, i don't care either way whoever was kidding, I just make blanket statement.
CrimsonPhoenix: his moveset is broken. Items get in the way of the competetion.
oni_link, but those are in the game
This level sucks
removing them doesn't make you play the game on how it's intend to be
certainly looks challenging
you're playing a different game instead
nice
It doesn't suck. It's just difficult.
CrimsonPhoenix: Well yeah, youre playing with rules. Rules make the game.
Tournaments have rules.
Gotta restart for updates there?
oni_link, nothing in Super Street Fighter 4 is removed
and the FULL game is in the tourney
CrimsonPhoenix: but not all tournaments are the same.
Well, that wasn't hard.
oni_link, I'm just saying
SSBB is dumb to play in tourney
what's your view on competitive pokemon battling?
CrimsonPhoenix: I see your points but people are gonna do what they want. *shrug*
you're not even playing the full thing
I don't mind competitive pokemon battles. It's not my thing, though
>reach top of level
>die
pokemon is a whole other thing
i hope i dont ebola :s
Yeah, I don't play PokeMon to be competetive, I play to relax. :3
get*
There are far worse things in this game
Zuxxez123: Agreed.
there are far worse things in life, period.
If he gets there I would like to see NewSuperBronyU get to the bandage girl levels
I don't play Pokemon for EVs, IVs, Natures, or Abilities. I play it because I enjoy it.
oni_link, don't get me wrong I did enjoy SSBB
I really don't play ANY game competively yet. Maybe try TF2 Professionally but I doubt that will last long.
but I just play it for the heck of it
08,01hm
heck I put Brawl - in it
It's amazing that people still play pokemon a decade after the last games came out
08,01i don't know
Lets put a smile on that face
lol
08,01i'm just... bleh
yep
I know that feel bro
TheBadger, actually Black and White came out less than a decade
I get that ALL the times.
*time
/me sadface too?
theyre definitly running out of ideas for new pokemon though, an icecream pokemon, really?
dat feel
CrimsonPhoenix: in terms of smash, items and certain characters take away from the competetive aspect. so thats why they do what they do. I know youre saying that the game wasnt meant to be played competetively in the first place but there are hardcore players. and thats what these tourneys cater to.
and I think B&W2 came out recently
dat feel is bad
/me v_v
Oh how I wish I could watch this game
pony_4889 a pokemon shaped like a pokeball, gen I
Kandarihu|Birthday: hows your bday been going?
Pony, what do you mean? I saw no ice cream poke mon in gold silver red or blue.
Kandarihu|Birthday happy birthday :)
:(
oni_link, they're just morons really
CrimsonPhoenix: oh yeah pokemon :D I gotta get that game. I play the first one competetively haha
this game just became N-game
>Says that gen 5 was unoriginal
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii:SDDD
It's been alright. I ate out at Genghis Grill
:D
if they want real hardcore stuff
>DOesn't look at the other gens
Really?
there's actual true fighting games for it
Normally, if there is a tourney around a game that wasnt for tourneys, the people doing the event with all the stuff figured out on what is fair and what isn't.
Kandarihu|Birthday: cool, altho i dont know what kind of food they have there :D
I'm sure you explained that, just throwing my 2 cents. :3
hahha, that's a laugh, playing gen I, the most unbalanced and broken gen of all competitely
try to go for the top when the soduim shooter goes up
>Implying that there have been pokemon games after Silver and Gold
lol
pfff
oni_link, one last thing, for me you're not serious on tourney play if you're not in EVO
>implying ruby/sapphire werent amazing
>implying ruby/sapphire were anything other than dumpster filler
0,14>implying implying
I have never played a single pokemon game
damn
they werent, they were a large step further
your winning strategy: use Mewtwo, or any psychic pokemon, and you'll be dominating
SaxyPretender implyception!
Lunar_Brony s an alien
and after kyogre/groudon took over, it was just amazing
CrimsonPhoenix: true. but think of it this way. people play what they like regardless of what others think. And the more you play, the better you get thus fueling the need for competetion. Because no matter how you see it, a fighting game is competetive.
0,14^
Meh, I LOVED Black and White. You saying that Gen 5 was unoriginal doesn't faze me AT ALL. Black and White were a HUGE step in the RIGHT direction. So is B&W2.
Dont know if trolling or just incredibly stupid....
So basically, otanet sucks.
And I should change ISPs.
AJIsAwesome: dem ev
evs
I was meaning to play B&W, never got around to it.
I didnt know my brother had people over :D I go downstairs to get a shot glass and the hall from the bottom of the stairs is dark - Bro's friend Dawson got me good
oni_link, still to me you're not serious in competition if you're not in EVO
I couldn't care about the EVs, IVs or anything like that.
TheBadger: oh so youre one of those people who think anyone who disagrees is stupid
I play Pokemon because it's fun.
Rustymeat no, I never touched a portable system until I got a DSi, despite just about everyone I know having atleast a GBA and DS lite
cousins and friends
Not usually, but when there's one correct answer, yes.
TheBadger:thats his opinion respect it
AJIsAwesome: I agree, Pokemon is a game you can pick up and play with out having a whole lot of background info on it, games like that are GREAT for just having a nice gaming session.
gtg at 11 D:
"Oh yeah, Gen 1 is best gen, all the others suck and are unoriginal!" Yeah, keep telling yourself that.
AJIsAwesome: so you dont play online? I beat the story so that was what was tiding me over for the next game.
uh oh
Oh, I respect his opinion, I just think it's incredibly stupid. Like Obama.
depends on whether you've triggered WK mode
TheBadger: well, your majesty, ruby/sapphire were great, irrelevant if you consider people who like stupid or not
because if you have, there is no excape
at the end, and ded
I never played PokeMon online, ONLY single player, I didn't want to get into that scene. :P
dammit - just waiting in the shadows as I was running down the stairs - that sneaky bastard :$
twilight_sprinkle: I actually LOVED R/S.
that girlfriend should've been killed
AJIsAwesome: almost everyone does
I have no opinion on it
i am disillusioned by all the conflict here
say*
Hi twilight_sprinkle
CrimsonPhoenix: Okay but say they do get Smash tourneys up on EVO. would that really change your mind on it? or would you still think of it as a casual game since its nintendo
where have i heard this song before?
hey CCCP :)
oni_link, smash was in evo
Hmm....only got 12 rustled Jimmies. Ill have to go harder next time
the game got banned
for later years
twilight sprinkle my faithful student how are you
11,02This game is too easy :/
NewSuperBronyU: :D
Smash will NEVER get in EVO
NewSuperBronyU you will regret saying that
CrimsonPhoenix: ah.
06,08NewSuperBronyU... your easy
well there goes my point.
colors!
/me shrugs
NewSuperBronyU too easy, then you should try I wanna be the guy, and no saving
ohai mid-
ohai God , im not too shabby, how are you, my lord?
GAH
Lunar_Brony: XD
0,14fun fact, they actually did have Smash at EVO
SaxyPretender, that's what I said
0,14Melee was there a couple of years ago
0,14got more hype than Guilty Gear
im good what have you learned about magic this week twilight
0,14...which is why GG hasn't returned
what is EVO?
oh hey there God
hi
music in this game is so good
0,14EVO is the biggest tournament series in the US
EVO is only the biggest Tourney event
oh
that akward moment when i really like the that akward moment meme
no wonder I never heard of it
US
tournament
hmm yes yes very good well keep up your studies
. . .
yes sir!
I actually enjoy watching some tourney
rooting for the player
and get hype
Either my video stream is laggy or it seems the character in this game just goes way too fast and jumps around a lot.
anyone watchh the fighting is magic tourney?
Nope.
Rustymeat, no I havent
Rustymeat: its on now?
no
Mozdoc yea, meatboy's slippery
I'd rather play the game than watch someone do it.
0,14couldn't, but saw grand finals
it was yesterday
SaxyPretender: Who won?
It was pretty hype
i hop someone uploads it
was Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy playable?
dash was playable
0,14uhh, Hiroshii, was it
HOLY SHIT WHAT?
OKay.
Where can we find the Fighting Is Magic tournament?
Its on their twitch channel
don't know about shy though
now I need to see it
SaxyPretender: Do you know which character?
0,14think AJ?
PUSH THE BUTTONS
Really?
I thought he would someone like Twilight.
Or perhaps Pinkie PIe.
AJ is basic
i guess they removed fluttersies instakill stare lol
and give hard punches
brb
twilight_sprinkle: Wait, Instakill stare?
CrimsonPhoenix: you know how you said Masahiro Sakurai didnt consider Smash as a true fighting game? Seth Kilian disagrees.
AJIsAwesome, it was a joke
Oh. :D
inb4 sb saysthis level is too hard

Thanks, but you were better off PMing.
Mmmh

kinda like that point
Ive always been meaning to ask is Fighting is Magic just Mugen?
oops
not really
oni_link, no
oni_link: Not.
Nope.
oni_link no, using a different engine
it's on another fighting game maker
oh. it looks similar. what did they use for it?
11,02:<
I actually saw the same fighting game maker in another fighting game
0,14Fighting Game Maker 2007?
but it's not Mugen
SaxyPretender, maybe?
0,14I forgot the year number
0,14but it is that engine
11,02Dat Ninja Gaiden spoof cinematic
NewSuperBronyU: these references, i love them D:
well sorta glad they didn't use mugen, otherwise we wouldn't have online multiplayer
08,01so
08,01has anyone played F.A.T.A.L.?
Nope.
that guy is really bad?
wow RD looks so unfinished
and I can see Fluttershy selectable
CrimsonPhoenix: IKR, she glides away
i keep forgetting to ask cynder to see if any of her friends wanna come here
Fluttershy has no hitbos and has only 1 attack
in that build
Meh. I'm waiting till the game comes out to give an opinion.
hitbox*
oni_link, yeah, I mean I know she has wings but that was like one frame
me too AJIsAwesome
HIA EVERYPONY :D
me too AJIsAwesome
Hi, abrony
hi abrony :)
ello abrony
AJIsAwesome, it's not a full opinion but something on what they did so far
Hi abrony
CrimsonPhoenix: you can still put a few more frames, have her hover not just slide away XD
oh super meat boy :) fun
Hm, I guess.
oni_link, exactly
DAT WINNING POSE
OH GAWD
Its so good
Hello there abrony how's it been?
CrimsonPhoenix: IKR XD

Good to hear.
yup
Got anything to chat about abrony?
not realy
YOu should play the dark levels NewSuperBronyU
oh yeah thats a good idea
well I know I'll be maining Rarity
abrony: Me neither... I'll just go back to lurking. ;)
even though she looks complicated
But she wont be able to talk to them here :/
yup me 2 :D
Don't know who I'll be playing as.
yeah true
so is super brony still playing Master Shake's Meat Mountain The Game By Master Shake?
AJIsAwesome, not AJ?
Maybe Pinkie Pie, perhaps.
Are you mad?
CrimsonPhoenix: Not sure. I want to have some variety.
AJIsAwesome, who are you and what have you done
Hm?
What are you talking about?
0,14and Buytoast gets points for Aqua Teen rference
with my favorite AJIsAwesome
hell umm that sounds :| sun
Umm..... he's still here?
fun
I would play AJ, but I want to give the other characters a chance.
08,01hey Wrek, still up?
though RD moveset looks solid
08,01Wrek: if you look outside and it's not cloudy, you'll probably see aurorae tonight
AJIsAwesome: same here, she looks like shes the most complete next to twilight. I might try pinkie
aurorae?
Hug attacks with Pinkamena. XD
08,01i've got an aurorawatch geomagnetism red alert coming up here
CrimsonPhoenix: her moveset looks great but they need to work on her walking animation lol
08,01http://aurorawatch.lancs.ac.uk/
Have they confirmed any other characters besides the Mane 6?
oni_link, she's not finished
AJIsAwesome not atm
no AJIsAwesome
oh
heck the leak only had 4 characters
08,01i would probably be able to see it from here if it wasn't so cloudy
not yet AJIsAwesome, but probably after they release the demo
a demo is not likely
they only manage to put RD playable for CG
0,14well, the mane 6 will be the full release
0,14everyone else will be DLC
CrimsonPhoenix: I know :P
SaxyPretender they're going to release everything all at once.

Well I think I will leave you fair pony folk. I have shows to watch XD Thanks for streaming NewSuperBronyU and I gotta get that Wii U reserved! D:
SaxyPretender for some reason I remember them saying everything will be available from the start. Maybe that's just stuff like maps and characters, like you don't have to unlock them via story mode

mhmm
you know what crazy wish i would like?
What?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Snuggle Truck Adds Ponies, Plants Trees
lolwut
"Snuggle truck" :S
dufu
:D
*dufuq
oh that thing
plant trees - is that like a pony chia pet kinda thing?
Watching daigo playing MLP Fighting is Magic
will the trees be in the shape of ponies :P
straight from the website
Hmm, sounds interesting.
should I just link the site?
it was banned on the app store iirc
I missed the title to this game, somehow :S
Snuggletruck
yeah
No, the game on the stream.
super meat boy
oh
I figured as such
yeah this is Super Meat Boy
no wait, iirc, they changed it from smuggling mexicans, to smuggling teddy bears and stuff
what...
wat?
:D
Snuggletruck and Smuggletruck. N and M
both exist
wait really?
thats too good :)
yea, it started out as a game where you smuggle mexicans, but apple wouldn't allow it, so they changed it to what we know today, and apple allowed it
and the other is people getting across the border
wait this cant be real
i went on reddit an typed in bronies, it gave me a whole bunch of posts just about that category, i think im gonna like this app
lolwut
MAKE SURE YOU LE UPVOTE EVERYTHING ON LE REDDIT
only on the internet can miss typing 1 letter lead to horrible consequences :D
:D
eeyup
Cypresswolf: not to mention auto correcting
auto correct can sometimes save you - ever drunk type and have it correct to something that doesnt sound as bad as what you were trying to say?
actually you have a good point there
v_v
Superbrony is gonn alove the hell beasts
YOu should get that bandage :3
and so a bunch of people buy the game called "Snuggle Truck"
anypony else try MCPixel? the game is quite strange :D
that game llooks great
loooooooooooooooooooooooool
The greatest thing about Mcpixel is that the creator iis trying to port it to the Commador 64
The fact he put McPixel on PirateBay for free, and offered for the people to give him money via paypal at whatever they thought he deserved for it.
ugh this boss sucks
Hit his eyes!
thats not how you beat him
just gotta avoid his fists
you have to jump down to within an inch of the lava, hang, then come up.
time for saving states
Rustymeat: i actuallty know his attack pattern buy heart
the bosses are the weakest point of this game
save states won't save you!
But they will save the contents of memory.
Rustymeat: your full of shit for saying that :3
the bosses are fun
:(
I guess
But there are only fun once
i unlocked the hardest char in the game \:3/
on my second attempt :3
bandage girl?
i wish I had Metroid Prime, so I coulg fight Quadaxis.
Kurra: have you played super metroid?
ninja boy?
I LOVE the music for this boss fight.
yes.
http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=120991286105
WTF
Rustymeat: the n+ ninja is NOT the hardest char
what is it again I forget?
the kidd
11,02:<
oh in terms of difficulty to get yeah the kid is a bitch to get
hahahaha
you could always hang time off one edge.
buy it
AJIsAwesome: This game has a lot of awesome songs.
But if I remeber correctly you need all the bandages for the ninja
Zuxxez123: Can't agree more.
Rustymeat: well no
the chars for the pc are different than the xbox
anyone happen to have a digital copy of The Hunger Games or know a spot I can torrent it from? I've just been informed that I need to read it
hey everypony,nice Super Meat Boy lol who's braving the toture of this?
You know whats funny
I onlyplaye the xbox version

cmon NewSuperBronyU you can do it!
BTW, what is "Spaghetti Western"?
Lunar_Brony: hello
AJIsAwesome a western movie filmed in Italy
hi therainbowvortex
Oh.
Okay. :)
thats quite a lot :o
Didnt realize my chat derped an hour ago.
im guessing not all gb games are that much :p
can someone tell me what we are watching right now?
Super Meat Boy TharBePonies
super meat boy
11,02:D
Played by NewSuperBronyU.
Winner!
hi TharBePonies
What makes it worth a lot is because its the very first game yoshi is in
hello
a morsel of meat fighting a giant brick in Hades.
You did it!
ello TharBePonies
hi TharBePonies
did i win?
Kurra seems legit
ah ok
Least I think it is..
11,02Easy :)
it is not 'legit.'
You did it NewSuperBronyU :3
hmmph
I might have to look it up again
i really love the soundtrack in RDR especially entering mexico for the 1st and "Far Away" plays as ya ride your horse :$ that part made squee w/ delight
It was the first yoshi game by itself
what is RDR?
Lunar_Brony: Red Dead Redemption.
ah
Oh if only I still had my xbox
Sketch_Toku_Brony: It's the little stuff in the game that get you deep down. :P
I could be trying that game out
ikr Zuxxez123
the hell?
Is this some bonus game?
why did you do that :o
suddenly you have lives
this is like 4-bit in 8bit.
how much does meat boy cost?
15 dollors I think
the cost of meat boy is too damn high
I'm sure there will be a steam sale for it if you are too picky with money. But I think it's worth the money.
08,01happy october everypony

AJIsAwesome: and there both platformers, hmmmm
Hmm, could they be.........NAH!
AJIsAwesome: Wonder how you use a shorthand for that. Would this be SMeatB, or SMeB to tell the difference?
well its not a rip off
Smb

Wb DeadpoolDash
hello
Wb Spectrum_Rush, Sunday
otakon17 I thought of Stupid Mario Brothers when I looked at that
Either that or SMeatB.
Lunar_Brony: :/
Hello potato_pony|
it's a good serie
*series
Lunar_Brony: there bringing it back, somehow with stupid mario football
Hi, potato_pony| :)
Dat prof. Fetus
hi potato_pony|
hello potato_pony|
>Mario and football
>What?
superretroworld they're /kinda/ bringing it back.
Oh um hello :)
jeez otakon17 that was a quick one
a spinoff i guess
yeah
Dear god the accuracy
Spectrum_Rush: I can see joins
Soccer was great, basketball was okay, but I'm not sure about football.
I'll have to wait until it comes out to see.
AJIsAwesome he, Stupid Mario Soccer was funny. "Red card because . . . because . . . because I hate you!"
otakon17: still , i mean you sent that before i even could see the chat, since im on a phone :p
11,02All dem Mario pings
Marco:
oops
Polo
XD
Lunar_Brony: Oh yeah, Red Card. :D
ROFL
Lunar_Brony: I remeber that. :D
this level sucks
we should totally stream the series
has it been streamed before?
I can't tell which one I find better: The GC one or the Wii one.
Where I currently have myself seated http://i.imgur.com/0emem.jpg
.-.
superretroworld not that I recall, although I became a brony long after episode 75
XAX nice!
nice XAX
I'm on a couch
XAX: that's sp beautifu;
GC makes it seem more realistic while Wii takes away the realism and puts in more action and difficulty.
in my basement
XAX: Beautiful.
That's a pleasent spot XaX
I'm in my dorm, doing homework.
That is, if I was working on it right now. :D
0,14nice
XAX: where do you live?
AJIsAwesome: Its actually getting kind of chilly, as you may be able to tell by the clouds.
wor: New Zealand c:
oh
AJIsAwesome: ikr. the weekend has gone by, and despite my promises, ive done nothing productive. god i hate myself
twilight_sprinkle: Same here.
/me buys plane ticket to New Zealand
wat. OneTrickPony|homewor, is what I mean .-. Not just wor.
Yeah unproductivity
Lunar_Brony: great episode. 'i threw the captain crunch directly to you, also i snapped your head during that flashback' xD
lol okay ^_^
Someone que up the pic
I LOVE Captain Crunhc.
*Crunch
Seriously
captain crunch is okay, resse puffs is my favorite
Why does touching other meat kill you?
Captain is terrible
superretroworld that was Pirate Crunch. My favourite part was Captain Morgan's Secret Rum Technique: Drunken Fooool!
superretroworld: i like the cereal, hate the commercials.
its sooooo terrible
Does that mean you are allergic to yourself?
ive never tried capn crunch. i like the plain ones with raisins and the fruit loops. i hate lucky charms tho
Give me frosted mini wheats any day
I mean, how do you sel a cereal like that using that method?
MINI WHEATS ARE SOOOO GOOOOOD
HHHNNNNGGG
AJIsAwesome: amazing things can happen when you taste resse puffs xD Lunar_Brony he just drank the whole bottle xD
Plain ol' cherios are good, even without milk.
I don't even eat cereal for breakfast. I always have Toaster Scrambles
twilight_sprinkle: I loved Lucky Charms until one day I ate it and then I said, "Wait a minute, these don't taste the same."
i <3 cinnamon toast crunch
^good cereal
superretroworld and then he passed out drunk
I like Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Can't get enough of that stuff!
I actually don't like Cinnamon Toast Crunch. :$
i either eat cereal or those quaker oatmeals
Nutri-grain is where it's at.
/me Why are we all talking in our heads?
At this point I would be screaming at the tv
Ohai Lunar_Brony!.. aww
AJIsAwesome: they were to sugary for me
applejacks, is ... awesome :)
I LOVE Honey Nut Cherrios, though. :D
hi Marco
Or banana on toast. Banana on toast is best toast.
Ryunosuke: There. i see it
I try and make breakfast muffin related whenever possible.
Cherrios are the top 3 up there.
:) but it is
I couldn't stand Cheerios as a kid. :$
on one of my computer's i cant have any contact with google (whow do i stop that) (it just happend today)
Lunar_Brony: he probaly could of died
ffffffffffuuuuuck! i wanna keep reading but i need to go to sleep nw :[ :(
good night
Bye, Dovah :)
I ate Honey Nut Cherrios out of the box as a kid... I still do for that matter. xD
applejacks, coco puffs, cinnemon toast crunhc, all are good
flutterchu: What do you mean you can't?
Dovah: night
Sleep well Dovah :3

Hell I remember little pudding Pop Tarts snacks

night Dovah
otakon17: Wait, pudding pop tarts?
best cereal that I have had was the Nintendo Cereal System
:)
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Yeah pre made smores you could munch them cold or warmed
Ryunosuke: YES.
AJIsAwesome: What?
it was good when you're 6 years old :)
I WANT THAT NINTENDO CEREAL BACK.
otakon17: I WANT!
otakon17: o.o lol i wanna try those now
AJIsAwesome: Imagine a tiny cookie filled with pudding and shaped like a poptart
Now I have a sudden urge for Smores, thanks chat. :P
otakon17: Sounds delicious.
http://www.padinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/cereal1.jpg -- for all you young whippersnappers
i had smore poptarts recently
I have a craving for Cap'n Crunch. :$
I miss Ecto Cooler Hi C - luckily...
you can make that
^^
there is a recipe for it
AJIsAwesome: I have a box in my kitchen right now. :3
Zuxxez123: Lucky you. :D
it was on...
I know of a recipe for it - makeshift recipe really :)
french cheese ftwwww
on
I may just get a bowl right now, in your honor AJIsAwesome. :P
Brad tries I believe
Zuxxez123: You don't have to. :D
lol did anyone notice those yoyo ball commercials? lol its the SAME one from the 90's :D
hey NewSuperBronyU, dont eat the mushrooms
might be in my backup hard drive :|
Knytt Story reference superretroworld?
Zuxxez123: eeyup
every level of this game i think "this cant get much harder" and every time im wrong
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Oh yeah, I remember those. :D
ANyone here remember "Sock em' Boppers"?
superretroworld: Yup. Gimme a brohoof for the reference friend. /)
:'( http://www.buzzfeed.com/daves4/25-foods-youll-never-eat-again
Zuxxez123: (\
^_^
Especially there Mario Party playthrough.
*their
What's their new one? I haven't seen it
AJIsAwesome: and Beyblades? man it was back when it first came out now we got this "Beywheels" crap /)_- its like "...REALLY?!?" lol
fortune street
oh man i remember those sprite remixes
were pretty good
Sketch_Toku_Brony: YES. I miss Beyblade.
How was Fortune Street? I never played it.
:O NO! Squeeze-its are gone :'(
french toast crunch was actually pretty good
AJIsAwesome: new stuff are Fortune Street gameplays.
surge was good
I think NewSuperBronyU is getting a bit hasty with some of these jumps
Ah. Okay.
AJIsAwesome: ikr? when it first came out it was so cool. lol every kid in my school had one
I LOVED Beyblade as a kid.
Apple Newtons nooo :'(
Four Loko. That stuff is crazy.
We were addicted to beyblade.
WAIT
Crystal pepsi, the world is better off without :)
Dammit! Oreo-O too - I dont want to live on this planet anymore
Beyblade
Apple newtonw?
They
Are
Beyblade, a time where things were simpler.
beyblade was the best
DARN IT!!
Fucking
Squeezits were decent enough :)
Cypresswolf: ikr
Spinning TOPS!
otakon17: Yep, they're wheels now.
never tried squeezits, always looked poisoinous to me
AJIsAwesome: -_____________-
Just like Yu-Gi-Oh did. Card Games on Motorcycles.
CK|Ded: How come ded?
Well, the last show.
AJIsAwesome: Another series I loathe
i feel the same way otakon17
Beyblade is a bit too simple, right?
eeyup
As simple as simple gets.
Cypresswolf: I LOVED Oreo O's.
THEY WERE AMAZING.
Oreo O's! Oh my GOD!
oh yeah i remember those!
AJIsAwesome: Also we're watching the YGO Pyramid of Light movie come Friday
i didnt prefer them myself
i think they still sell them in my local market
Goddammit
otakon17: Okay. Seems interesting.
AJIsAwesome: Its yGO
otakon17: norm or AB?
otakon17: Partially sleep, partially mood
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I hope both
otakon17: Wait, yGO? :S
Yugioh
otakon17: lol that would be funny
Damn tiny keyboard
Oh.
Anyhoo
It'll come down to "Trusting in the heart of the cards"
/me shudders
You mean cheating
psstt 'that's code for cheating'
Because he's clearly cheating in every single episode
No more like dumb luck
No, I mean cheating.
Case in point: "Soldier of Stone, destroy The Moon!"
Okay
Whats the stats on them?
Hello Everypony :)
I trust the heart of the cards in Magic the Gathering on XBLA, and it works for me!
Hiya Laurayne wb
hi Laurayne
Heart of the Cards is just a dub invention. In the original, he's just hoping for a good draw, and usually gets it.
I saw this guy with a tatoo of ACE playing card on his wrist. XD
Thanks
Zuxxez123: -___________________-;
otakon17: Soldier of Stone is a 1300/2000, and The Moon is a Magic Card.
hey Sumica, if you're lurking, can you PM me?
otakon17: Dat face. :3 That's what I wanted.
still got my blue-eyes white dragon. awesome foil on that card
Stupid internet derping. :|
CK|Ded: Special ability perhaps?
Nope.
Gundam Style shirt :D http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/zoom/f25b_gundamstyle.jpg
I had 2 of the Exodius cards, I think.
I Just Love Midnight Rain Showers, Dont You All? :)
I can't remember
twilight_sprinkle: o.o?
CK|Ded: Well c'mon there has to be something then
Soldier of Stone had no enhancements or anything either. His monster just attacks a magic card and destroys it.
Whatever happened to Hawiian Punch? I never see that anymore - nor the commercials for it
Laurayne: YES, I love rain during the night time. :)
Because that is totally how the game works.
Also, hi Laurayne. :)
Oh, and then there's the more infamous one.
Laurayne: Sky is clear here and a bright full moon at that
Hello AJIsAwesome
I like when it rains most times, mostly at day time, I like when it's darker for some reason...
twilight_sprinkle: i have learned the G3 theme song and i regret nothing
CK|Ded: Swords of Binding Light or the special summonings rules that get ignored?
Zuxxez123: Same here.
"I use my Catapult Turtle to launch my dragon monster at your floating fortress monster, destroying its levitation belt and causing it to fall on top of all of your other monsters, which somehow drops your LP to zero."
I LOVE it when it rains.
me too
me too^
CK|Ded: Ah yes
Especially for long periods of time.
Ditto AHJ.
AJ*
CK|Ded, what?
unfortunately all i get are wimpy 30 minute rains maximum
Me Too
know*
AJIsAwesome: Do you like a small drizzle, or a heavy rain?
I Love Storms And/Or Overcast Weather
Zuxxez123: In the middle, IMO.
Laurayne: YES.
JUST YES.
rain is best weather
Like I said, "Heart of the Cards" is code for "cheat my ass off". I think no one knows the rules of the card game and they just make up the effects as they go.
i mean, i seen that particular episode and was 'wait, what? YGO does NOT work like that"
I LOVE Overcast.
Lasharus: yes i love it
CK|Ded: Screw the rules I have crazy hair?
Laurayne: We are in the same boat my friend. Overcast is an awesome feeling for me.
^
nonono
I love also being able to smell the rain as it comes. :3
Anyways, sleep.
Night/Overcast Day Is When I Feel Most At Peace
I've never done that. :$
its due to his power source, his.... leather pants
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFhJaxrN6zE&feature=g-vrec im dying hahaha
NIght, CK|Ded :)
bye CK|Ded
YuGiOh abridged is worth checking out if anypony hasn't somehow heard of it.
Maybe I am crazy, but I swear I can small rain. xD
I remember a little pack of crispy bread sticks with a little tub of fake cheese in my lunchbox in my youth - what was that called?
CK|Ded, no it isn't. Wishing for a lucky draw isn't cheating. And neither is getting it. If anything, it's plot armor
ya know what would be a neat cosplay? a John Marston cosplay BUT styled and theme after Applejack
Ryunosuke ah, that's where you're wrong, it's the shoes
Your Right. Rain Does Have A Scent
Cypresswolf|Glitch: I know what you're talking about, but I can't remember.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Lol, I'd like to see that.
Kinixys: what do you mean that my computer is agianst google (is there anyway to fix it)
Cypresswolf|Glitch: Handi-Snacks
my god this game is the embodiment of evil
:) Dunkaroos come to mind but that had chocolate didnt it? Handi Snaks ^_^ Thats it!
YES.
DUNKAROOS
ahhheheh
flutterchu: I was just cracking a joke. What seems to be your trouble?
That was the Crystal Meth of my childhood. :$
oh no ;_;
Im Sorry If Im Not Mentioning The People Im Talking About In My Messages. Im Still Getting Used TO It lol AJIsAwesome Zuxxez123
Laurayne: It's no problem. :)
Laurayne: No worries, I'm used to not having that feature, I keep up with our convo. :3
Can't wait to see the replay of this one
magmablock: Me too. :D
Theres Just So Much Info To Read At Once Its Overwhelming For Me So Its Nice To Have Those Little Blips
Laurayne: I know that feeling.
AJIsAwesome, me neither. The fall at the beginning is going to be amazing
Laurayne: Agreed whole-heartedly there. :3
Kandarihu|Birthday: I LOVE Fall. One of my favorite seasons.
i wonder if the Apple Marston cosplay would be funnier w/ a bandolier of apples and wut not? :D
sadface
Spring>Fall>Winter>Summer.
Aw
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Once again... I would love to see that.
And With My Slow Reading/Bad Eyes/ Slow Typeing, Its Really Not Helping AJIsAwesome Zuxxez123
Zuxxez123: i may draw up an idea eventually
Thank God there's no loading screen when you die
^^^^^^^^
Laurayne: Ah, I see.
Laurayne: Years of being background noise in plenty of chat rooms have made me hone my abilities on reading / typing. :P
magmablock: lol imagine SMB w/ Sonic 2006 loading times muhaha
I Really Know That Feeling Too Well Zuxxez123
Can't wait for new pony episodes, so much text. :D
Sketch_Toku_Brony: When you start doing that concept art, let me know, I'd LOVE to see it. :3
sure thing Zuxxez123
SMB needs more cutscenes (unskipable prefered). *ducks*
What Game Is This Anyway? It Seems Difficult
Kinixys: :D
Super Meat Boy.
I See
>.< so close
Is it wrong of me to hear his reactions to dying so many times?
It Looks Like Meatwad
looking up discontinued stuff of the 80's now :) anyone remember Planter's Cheese Balls?
what is the white lumps supposed to represent?
Sounds... Interesting Cypresswolf|Glitch :P
I don't. Sound familiar.
11,02OneTrickPony|homewor: Maggots.
:D
Smack Cereal is long gone :(
oh
im amazed people would actually spend money on this game just to torture themselves
Cypresswolf|Glitch: I think I still see Smack.
Honey Smacks?
Shark Bites gummi snacks
I Enjoy Plain (Non Frosted) Corn Flakes More Then Any Cereal...
and i was wondering why i was getting pings
ok... so whos playing super meat boy?
I miss Campbell's Creamy Chicken Alfredo soup. That stuff was the best canned soup ever
J_E_Smith71: Wait, they had that?
twilight_sprinkle, some gamers value challenge in their games. It's not torture.
I love Chicken Alfredo.
Dr. Pepper Chewing Gum
I've seen shark bites and honey smacks at my grocer.
^
Power Puff Girls Cereal
WAIT
PPG Cereal?
Dr. Pepper / Mountain Dew flavored Chap Stick... I remember that stuff.
^
I had no idea either AJ
Anyone remeber TMNT pies?
*remember
Kandarihu|Birthday: i suppose, but i dont entirely see the fun in playing levels over and over just for the short feeling of satisfaction once youve beaten it
Hehehe SOmeone Should Make A Ceral Box Picture Edit With Applejack On The Front Of Applejacks :P
Laurayne: I've seen that before. ALL MY MONEY. :D
Kandarihu|Birthday: altho i guess if youre totally mlg and bored by other games, i suppose i understand
AJIsAwesome: The TMNT pies? Oh yes
Shut Up And Take All My Money! D:
*snrk :D* New Coke
Slimer Kool-Aid drinks?!
New Coke?
Is Mr. Pibb still around?
Cypresswolf|Glitch: eeyup.
Cypresswolf|Glitch: Yep
Yep
dem pings
I actually drank it recently.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: How are being pinged?
AJIsAwesome s:p
ohai, Glitch! :)
AJIsAwesome: i wonder if there any samples on the internet?
Cypresswolf|Glitch: ah man i remember that stuff lol
that never sat right with me
superretroworld: Samples?
so yeah everytime someone ping Cypresswolf|Glitch i'm getting ping too
Cypresswolf|Glitch: YES.
AJIsAwesome: i mean cans
I had the dark green Shrek one - my brothers didnt like it - but tasted like ketchip
superretroworld: Cans of Pibb?
^^
AJIsAwesome: cans of new coke
OH. :$
13so peta made this game right?
:D
13to make you feel miserable about dealing with meat?
lol-ed
0,14pfft, PETA
Shizuka: PFFT! Peta couldn't make a game this good even if they tried for 10 years.
I remeber them trying to attack Mario for the Racoon suit. :D
French Toast Crunch
I Think Rarity Would Would Be A Good Choice For A MLP Cereal Brand. You Could Have Marshmellow Gems And Cereal Clothing Of All Kinds :);)
Cypresswolf|Glitch: I actually never had that. What would it be like?
Shizuka, PETA raged against this game by making a parody called Super Tofu Boy. Edmund McMillan got back at them in grand style
Cypresswolf|Glitch: thats good
13oh pixel perfect platformers, your cheeky ways of faking difficulty by making a margin of error smaller than the player's control resolution
http://discontinuedfoods.com/image/14334557684 That's What I'm Talking About!
Laurayne: That seems like a good idea. :)
^_^
Saturm, you still up?
i want this game so bad, but im afraid of the difficulty
Cypresswolf|Glitch: YES.
I miss those pies so much.
Vanilla Pepsi & Vanilla Coke
Vanilla Coke.
I Remember The TMNT Popsicles
Cypresswolf|Glitch: i miss that
I LOVED VAnilla COke.
11,02I'm tired of this game -.-
NewSuperBronyU: You should take a break. :D
AJIsAwesome: Same! I buy it whenever i see it! :3
Then play something else firendo.
i actually saw vanilla coke recently
RaveBrony: /)
friendo*
AJIsAwesome: (\
NewSuperBronyU: you dont have to play it if you dont want too

Hiya Shizuka "new" pnc adventure?
Its a game?... O.O???????????????
LES DO DIS
this should be ... interesting
Shizuka: ADVENTURE!!!!!!!!
13yeah given this intro you'd be forgiven for thinking it's a movie
This seems like a game in the vein of Phantasmagoria.
it... looks like myst... IN SPAAAACE
ORDERS DALTON!!
wow...
Actually, it looked like a game to me, Shizuka.
Awesome /)^3^(\ :D
Nite everypony.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5tyMXXDPX4
13more like myst.. IN TIIIIIIME
Shizuka: I have never ever heard of this. When was this made?
13demo for this was on Riven CD 4
oh...
Shizuka: Pretty good actually considering what it is
1397 i think
If you dont know how hes getting every answer right, ill tell you how :P
13presto studios later went on to make myst 3 for cyan
*Wing Wong* Sounds in the background
the tsa
rly
13he's like a young brendan frasier only not
This was published in 1998. The first game was published in 1992.
Hello everypony.
hi Sabershy
13this is following off the events of journeyman project 2, which i don't have
. . .
13thankfully arthur fills us in
Start?
Sonic Screwdriver is best Wii Remote: http://eftm.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/doctor_who_sonic_screwdriver_wii_remote2.jpeg
13now i'm certain this guy was in a movie
Hi, Sabershy! :)
So what kind of gameplay does this game have?
Hey,AJIsAwesome. :)
13mystlike
Where's the game?
I see
13this is building up the story so
No, you see, that guy actually talks like that :P
13what they're letting you infer is this... you play Gage Blackwood, Agent 5 at the Temporal Security Agency in the 2300s
13that guy that just died invented time travel
13your org is tasked with making sure people don't screw with history
I'm off to bed - goodnight everypony :)
So are you timed?
NIght, Cypresswolf|Glitch :)
13nah
Cypresswolf|Glitch: Later.
Or "timed", when you take all the time in the world?
13you can time travel :3
Like in FF7
Oh, and mess with time yourself? Well, the time where you fail, I guess :P
13iunno :3
what show is this?
13this is the only one i've played
The Extraterrial looks like ahhh..... ._.?
Or, track down the ones who are actually messing around with the timeline.
13that
It's a game.
oh, is this 12 monkeys?
13agent 3 went rogue, she's the one from the opening
I missed if it said the title of the game or anything; what is this?
Shizuka who is this
The day when the earth as been doubled
The Journeyman Project, Zuxxez123.
3.
Pegasus?
13i could imagine either one of these guys being a Doctor :3
Thank you kindly Polydunami.
13also you're about to see what i mean about mouse control sucking >>
thats not a delorean
So long as they can affect a believable British accent of their choosing, huh?
13agent blackwood maybe not but i can totally see the other guy being a Doctor
13reminds me of tennant
The one in the background?
13yeah
13oki here we go
Yeah, kind of
Shizuka what is this we are watching?
This is The Journeyman Project.
This is the game?
The third game in the series
i-is meanwhile here
13must not be
Nope.
GREAT SCOTT!
nope
He is note.
He left.
not*
13i don't see a ton of bitching so guess not
*sigh* thank goodness
You are safe flutterchu :P
Shizuka: Ha!
It's 6 AM where Meanwhile lives, so I highly doubt it
I love you all
Garettbrony: <3
We love you too, Garettbrony :)
its midnight in Neighbraksa
we wub you to Garettbrony :3
Pe-Ka-BOO!
lol, arthur
im guessing because its tool assisted
13this VA has been in other stuff too
Sounds a little like Norm Macdonald. Just a little.
...
13>comes from the 2300s
13>still uses analog video
Crap
Shizuka: why do I get the feeling that was a fanboy
Damn virus is on the suit
the TSA? time for strip searched?
13it's an AI that lives in your helmet
I thought it was a virus
13he'll keep you guys informed while i flail the camera around
13well he annoyed agent 3
When you play the game you can spell the right answer wrong and still get it right
This guy takes advantage of it
13the player is apparently okay with him since they were together for journeyman project 2
lol
he basicly adds words that are not necessary and the game just doesnt pick it up
Okay
Lol
no memory of me. But I'm your best friend!
This begs the question, Shizuka; have you played the first game?
13well HE remembers you
but picks up the right words so it thinks you had the right word
13i haven't played first either
13this is the only one i have
Right
oh
Lol again
keep on, Shizu. I'm sure you'll beat it like all the others
Comense Flailing
I saw the video years ago, thought it was clever
i have not clue whats going on
sleepy time, have a good night everypony :)
night kirz|art :)
Arthur really likes to cut himself off sometimes, huh.
13yeah i'll have to be careful with the cues
I can't sleep :'(
13also i'm barely clicking and you can see how bad the camera is
I can't sleep either YNOP
/me hugs YNOP
Confound these ponies, they drive you to insomnia :P
13arthur gives you hints, and then gets cheeky about them :3
Apparently, the guy who voices Arthur is named Matt Weinhold or something.
YNOP: I know that feeling.
gonna idle for a bit. night if i dont come back
Insomnia gets the best of us.
i feel pain in my dreams
That sucks. :(
*YN-I think he/she left
This game as release in?
This one was published in 1998.
k
night :)
*cough* rope ladder *cough* :D
Cope Hatter
ill probably be up another hour
Hope Platter
As far as I know, the first game was published in 1992.
pervy robot
yeah I'll be back before then
Can you smack him?
so this is halflife source
looks different than the rest of the series
No you idjit
He's more like an AI than a robot, honestly.
. . .
that robot buddy of his reminds me of Tom Servo and Crow T Robot from Mst3k
Its The Journeyman Project
Also cussing?
I'm surprised
eclipse?
oh my
Yeah, I can see why you would hate the controls; if the 'looking around' part is as jumpy as it seems to be in this stream...
13yeah
oh shit
signs is back
Okay the hell
13it's just a bug with the VM though i'm sure
get in the bunker
welp
13the demo wasn't that bad
Okaaaaaaaaay
If there is one thing I have learned from Bronystate is that the Mods are really into Ponies (duh) MST3K, Adventure Games, Retro Gaming, and Geeky Movies. My kind of People
So it's not as jumpy without the videomaster?
13you may have noticed the xp boot screen earlier :3
Shizuka: Maybe its bc your streaming it?
13this is a virtual machine
13of win xp
Shizuka: Thats why
13it's a bug with the VM is all
13but this won't run on win 7
13much less run on win 7 and let scrcap latch on
Shizuka: You couldn't do the usual compatibility option?
13not that
Garettbrony: I agree with that, these are my kinda people. :P
13it needs libraries etc that aren't in vista/7
Shizuka what OS are you running and what emulator and where can I get this game?
This is Cleverbot as if he behaved 100% like a human.
nice
i'm liking eyeball jar there
jesus this AI should be on the Satilite of Love not in this mans Time Suit
:D
I hope the inventory system doesn't work quite John Egbert's in Homestuck...
You named your computer Asuka, Shizu? :3
*like, not quite
so wait Shizuka , did you finish myst?
looks like the building from the mummy 3 where you find the direction too Shangri-La
13revelation was done in one day
twilight_sprinkle: Yep.
Yeah she finished Myst IV twilight_sprinkle... I think.
crap, i missed the ending..
that AI and to many funny quips to be annoying
13the worst part of the camera
13I CAN'T NOD AND SHAKE MY HEAD ><
Pope Bladder
13you'll have to make do with cursor flailing..
Mope Nadder
trope Flatter
13rope ladder was left behind in atlantis
Well, are you expected to make those movements to progress with the game, Shizuka?
barn
Dope Padder
Like Mass Effect, but you control your head movements?
13it's camera control is all
13looking around
Right
13but the VM has introduced a bug that the camera swings faster than it should
13allow me to demonstrate
Yeowch
13obviously i should be able to drag closer to edge and not flail around
13again, it's a bug with the VM, no fix
you spin me right rould like a recond baby
i here lightning :'(
It's not coming from me, flutterchu :P
13the audio bug is new to this run i think, i had to troubleshoot the audio earlier
13so, stuttering is also no fix, sorry
13still, it works well
Well, it's not crashing, so that's a plus.
13not crashing *yet*
Oh dear
xp = Good , Vista= shit , 7 = Meh, Its Okay
13XP is horrendously outdated
Dammit
night everypony
I gotta leave myself
Good night, thelonepony
Night thelonepony
See you, otakon17
Not bc I need sleep
Goodnight thelonepony
night otakon17
But my iPod batteries are nearly dead
Dammit
Shizuka: Thanks for the adventure game, good luck.
Night, thelo- gone
atleast the lightning isnt sightable and loud
Didn't know you could connect to the internet with an iPod.
/me grumbles "Missing Shizuka stream AGAIN goddammit..."
lol old shaw brother reference
bronystate is Part of this balanced breakfast of brony entertainment and silly fillies!
can we request old kung-fu movies for movie night?
i mean if you look at the corner
taoumi: Of course
Apparently created by a Dr. Kenneth Farnstein, Arthur was.
Dammit, me and my Yoda language -_(\
brb i half to know who gets to be the first one eliminated on the reality show i signed up (i have immunity (3 )
He worked at Gizmonic Institute just another face in a red jumpsuit
:D
good morning everypony ^_^
Hey there, NocturnalBlade|Homew
what is being played right now?
It's called The Journeyman Project. This is the third game in the series.
ahhh, ok...never heard of it XD i assume Shizu is playin?
Yep
Right now, it seems that everypony is busy... not talking, I guess :P
I'm going to school in just a few minutes
So figures
i am here what do you want to talk about
Hi, NocturnalBlade|HW :)
have fun killerpony7733 lol
Well, so long as its not nothing, I'm fine :3
NocturnalBlade|HW Got physics and chemistry first so that's good and then english after lunch
Wow, one wrong move and we would've been pancakes.
*he
killerpony7733: cool, high school or college?
I'll say
Now this is getting interesting
Are the Cyrollans the villain race or something?
NocturnalBlade|HW So mines just 10th class
i live in Neighbraska
killerpony7733: oh XD my bad
13it's probably established in the first two, but in the 2300s humanity makes contact with the Cyrollans and enters an alliance
NocturnalBlade|HW Ah anyone can make the mistake
13they call it the symbiatry or something
Right
13but they're good guys
Alright, time for me to hit the hay. Good night, everyone! :)
13or at least, they better be since there was a joint vessel in the opening :3
nite AJIsAwesome *hug*
Symbiotry of peaceful beings, apparently
Thanks for the stream NewSuperBronyU and good luck with yours, Shizuka! :)
/me hugs NocturnalBlade|HW good night. :)
13stop acting at me!
Goodnight AJIsAwesome
0,14he looks like Rico from Judge Dredd
So the man is the person you're controlling?
/me hugs AdamTheDuck good night as well :)
The young man
13the guy in the green suit is me :3
13or the player character anyway
0,14...still looks like Rico >.>
0,14half expected a DA LAWWWW
oh shit when did the grandpa from grounded for life get here
13journeyman project 1 deals with you, agent blackwood, stopping this guy, father of time travel, from killing the cyrollan ambassador
and why does he have so many chins
Okay, I looked this guy up, and it seems he's played by an actor named Graham Jarvis.
13yeah looking through the imdb i don't see anything i'd recognize him from
/me plays amazing grace
I recognize him from a bit part in M*A*S*H, actually.
im going to sleep now see ya guys later ^-^
He played Colonel Whiteman, aide to General MacArthur who was to visit the 4077th.
what is this?
The Journeyman Project. This is the third game.
Oh, good night, OneTrickPony!
nite OneTrickPony|homewor
See this being? That's a Cyrollan.
0,14man, dem's some freky alien design
They're, actually.
Night OneTrickPony|homewor
Quel'thalas?
13yeah it's obvious CG but it's really good CG
Fair for its day, I suppose
But it doesn't actually distract from the game itself.
Or detract, for that matter.
13it's the elcor!
too many emotions to be elcor
I like this guy's facial expressions :D
He's so serious, he's hilarious
Back at the bat-cave, hah
So. Do you eventually have to visit all three times?
Authur reminds me of tom servo and crow t robot from mst3k
13yep
0,14flaky temple dandruff?
13and there's items in each that the others need
0,14they clearly need pillars and columns
13doh ><
Right, just like a true adventure.
13dat pun
13dat terrible terrible pun
0,14:3
its a trap
I'm feeling like a whole Myst theme going on here
13you'll see me doing camera moves like that a lot
Oh yeah, this place
PARKOUR
Oh, Arthur
0,14Cage is a Scootaloo
13yeah he's just getting started :3
Arthur's witty banter keeps him from being annoying
13also i can speed it up :3
The voice clips or the video?
and they totaly can't hear the THUNKTHUNKTHUNK of the running
13video
13specifically transitions between nodes
13cause sometimes he walks sloooooooow
Nice
I love the jokes
13he's got a ton
the other lever krunk
13just wait
13there's an awesome easter egg
0,14I like the cut of this guy's jib
keep turning
Set gears
Arthur r u a member of the satilite of love?
he said shaft
hows the wind mill turning mutha....
13wind
13duhhh
whose*
SHAFT
13i am
13i have invisible hands
hey
hi
Shizuka Is a unicorn that how she moves the things invisibly
13arthur also gives history lessons
13which is pretty cool
I might be heading off soon, getting sleep
sleepy*
yeah I'm not gonna stay for long either
well im off 2 sleep night everypony :)
13and no one sees me >>
Good night, Sketch_Toku_Brony
Definitely Myst
Night Sketch_Toku_Brony
Well, how many Myst games do you know that have witty exposition fairies?
0,14but Shizuka, ninjas aren't supposed to be seen
HOITYTOITY
They're supposed to blend in with the crowd, SaxyPretender
exposition
0,14also, wow, Gilligan's Island reference
13it's not myst but it's in the vein of myst
13saxy got it :3
0,14:3
I need to see that show
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdVuEpD9_IY
All I know is the theme
Star Trek
0,14XD
how did he know there was a native outside of view ?
13he just does
BURK
dat 4th wall breaker guide
13it's a lazy way of explaining the mechanic
13that you have to be disguised as a native of the time to interact or be seen
13cause you obviously can't walk up to someone in 2300s armor when you're in ancient atlantis :3
Star gate thins diferently
13well yeah
So does Doctor Who, actually
13don't think there's any stargate references
mst3k refs just by the character of aurthur alone
13i thought doctor who said the tardis disguises and translates for you
translates sure
I've seen the Doctor hang out with Aztec... Mayan... things.
disguised i don't think so
13hm
People.
13well anyway
13it's an extra loophole that all three of these civs get blown up tomorrow
13so really who cares if you're seen in future costume
13they're dead anyway and can't affect the timeline
isn'tthere like an invisability option like the other suits?
inb4 they see you, get scared, run out of the city before it gets destroy
let's play a song so the boat can sleep
lol
13the tiny text is a VM bug too i think
0,14fun fact: the name for a Creten double-headed axe is a Labrys
dont visit pompeii on volcano day
and atlantis speaks english cause reasons
13arthur's translating
13and
Great imitation
13shooping your eyes so the lips sync?
nothing to look here just a blind man climbing a boat
0,14can I assume time wizardry?
Well, looks like the Laughing Man has some competition
Cagey, locked up, hah!
13>prisoner on a ship
13>has atlantean coins for you
0,14ikr
I like that wig
"You don't use narcotics do you Bob?"
damn that blind guy can climb like a frantic monkey
13just speeding up video
>blind old man
>climbing mast
Have you tried changing your form in front of someone?
13can't
13they'd see it and freak out
Doesn't even give you the option?
oh shit, its the guy from stargate
13nah
13see watch, i'll try
Dat jerk
eat his soul or something
you're from the futrue
13if you ride around as the prisoner with him, he gives you exposition
Okay
...
13see he's not looking so i can change here
Well, that's kind of funny
Doesn't even question how the blind man can swim
second class citizen on an Utopia dosen't seem so bad
13not to mention how he hears no footsteps but suddenly there's a different guy there :3
But it's a Utopia
13mst3k mantra everypony~
13okay
13awesome easter egg time
Okay, I was waiting for this
Okay, goodnight everypony. See ya some time. :)
Oh my
Dat 4th wall breakage
ha
dem computer genarated
chia
13just wait
in you are wondering how he eats and breathes and other science facts just repeat to youself its just a show you should really just relax
13i think my favorite from that is "niiice flat puppy~"
a spank machine
how kinky
^
Name something that only children wear
guess what the guys answer was :P
I didnt watch the whole thing, what was it?
clothes :p
...
NewSuperBronyU: cheif excellence's
I'm heading off, cyas
I need to watch more family feud again :D
Oh, that eyebrow lift :D
alright night
13i love how you have infinite coins
night
13it's not replicating your inventory cause you lose some plot items
Shizuka maybe he gave you change for your gold coin
isent he from a tv show?
It's awfully open with that information
the ferryman sounds like a male zecora
Not quite the poet, though
13well you're both captures from outside atlantis
HE expected that response from the blind guy.
the "looks like a storm"
lol he gets lonely on the sea
13I MUST GO NOW, MY TIMELINE NEEDS ME
0,14XD
Yes
Dis is awesome but i have to go to sleep, Goodnight everyone
Thanks for the stream Shizu
Good night, Trixie
0,14man, I hope we can weather any weather puns
Careful, you may work up a storm there
0,14It snow problem, Polydunami
13NOW YOU FOGGED UP
XD
13OH GOD
nothing like late night gaming to bring out the puns
The chats really being flooded with puns
thr dead terrorist
13A... C.... phlehm
nite T
I wonder, will you sleet people's throats in this game?
Shizuka: dat achmed the dead terrorist
Okay, that was in bad taste
13nah our mission is still a bit hazy
13:3
I love the similarity with Myst.
Wait a second, is Shizuka playing Myst?
No, this is The Journeyman Project
Nope Panda|Drawing, a different game
The third game
I dont have the stream up atm, so i was just asking :3
Very well.
pulleys
0,14did someone say leverage?
wow, very Myst-esque puzzles.
Panda|Drawing: I'm back
DeathStar you arent back :3
See, Presto Studios created this series. Cyan is the company that produced the Myst series.
Panda|Drawing: yes I am
DeathStar nope :3 you are still done
gone*
...he's kinda creepy
Although Presto Studios DID produce Exile...
13dammit ferryman stop spoiling the timeline
Panda|Drawing: awww :( but I wanted to cuddle you
Pfft.
DeathStar ^^ oh btw, its posted
:O Shizustream!
Panda|Drawing: I saw, I love the censor XD
xD
13he loves his job
He took my jurb
Good morning Bronystate :$
Hey there, MadSurge

Reminds me of Taj, the elephant genie from Diddy Kong Racing.
I like fairys, they're sparkly

Hay, Listen!
Phase4... so many derps
or tatl
Panda|Drawing, 6_9

13dem huge tracts of land
Or that voice in general
Oh my
Monty Python ref
A reference I actually got
:George Takei:
Shizuka: no shit, look at them bumps o__o
endowed with HUGE....tracks of land...
someone say land http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs3/2170773_o.gif
13john goodman!

The Journeyman Project
Big... pot...
This one is the third game in the series.
Aaaaah
13his pot is in the kiln
13duuuuuuude
^
We're gettting all fired up, man.
So... thats what Shizuka sounds like?
JKJK
so... in this game... you play as a changeling? O_o
Pretty much, yeah
You have to, because you are travelling through time.
yay time travell
/me approves
Right now, we're in Atlantis just before it gets destroyed :P
Sylandest, DeathStar, doesnt the guy that Shizu is playing, sound kinda like Raja? O_o
Panda: :D I would like to hear what Shizu sounds like though
Panda: a little....
13well
13that's arthur the AI you're hearing
Panda: I think if raja tried he would sound like that
So was this blind beggar blinded as a punishment?
13probably
MadSurge, her voice would make you blind from the awesome.
13he was with the temple but was cast out
Yeah, I kind of figured that he was from the temple
Churn that olive oil, bby
Panda: aye, he does sound like raja a bit
DeathStar >.< I though I accedentally walked in on a convo with him in it XD
Panda: her voice would be so awesome I'd require my brown pants :D
I think imitating her might get yiu into the temple
Panda: XD
I'd require my white pants.
MadSurge, no, its not akin to the "brown noise"
What happens at the festival stays at the festival

But i miss Princess_Cadence
I <3 Shizuka streams
^
^^
^^^
Dat vivi
sorry Shizuka. I only come around when I get a ping. ^_^;
13><
Should've been here for Journeyman Project, Rain; they made a bit of a deal about nasty weather
Rain D: I pinged you hours ago! You big meanie!
no you didnt.... or at least I didnt get one
Stream is down post youtube links now
Hello
/me looks at PM list. "Rain, I see it right there!" D:<
More of a secret code, actually. If someone says, "Looks like nasty weather," reply with, "It may even rain."
Anyway, I need to go to bed now. Good night, everypony.
Panda, I have absolutely no PMs from you in the last hour.
DeathStar... its your fav show!
I have one from you at 3pm.
Hey guys i will be right back going to set me up with some bed night snacks to get ready to watch some MLP episodes again
Rain D: thats when I pmed you!
Panda: I turned off the stream! what is it?
Panda, that was 12 hours ago.
DeathStar The buffer show :3
Rain... good point >.>
Panda: :D
13http://i.imgur.com/5j7Tv.png
13he colored in my mane today, but i do not have it yet
Darn him and his ability xD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5NgLEP7vw0
Wait, are you the unicorn?
Right
Yeah she is Polydunami
Rose on the left, Violet on the right... I like the simbolism
Then why do people say the facial expression should be switched?
13only meanwhile does
Oh. Never mind then :D
13because meanwhile wants to be banned
:O
dont ban him!
what, Shizuka?
Yeah, Meanwhile is too much of a staple to just be banned willy nilly.
now I wouldn't say that Shizuka its more http://i.imgur.com/0C2rJ.jpg?1
Then again, rules.
what did meanqhile do?
13trolling
being meanwhile
13been getting worse all week
Something he's not telling us or something?
you'd think a warning would do right?
For Meanwhile?
because that is the exact reason I walked away for a while, Shizuka
But, thats Meanwhile... He's always been like that.
Doesn't justify being a jerk though :/
/me shrugs
again
He's been like that since the day I encountered him. It's just in his nature.
wait shizu are you refering to those aquatic life pics he linked?
a warning
Or those... "icky bug things"?
13when told not to post the giant bugs or similar closeups he starts spamming sea life instead
13it's trolling
Oh.
Shizuka
again
a warning.
^
13ja
www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7xEu5jabVw
Well, if you want to use a warning, you'd have to be strict about it.
Well I posted sealife too, am I officially warned too?
MadSurge you werent the one warned hun
Shizuka: unless i missed something he posted the sealife first, then the bugs when someone in chat said they weren't scared of no sea life, and then back to sea life
13no he's always posted the bugs to get reactions out of people
13especially me
Panda: darn my taste for the macabre :D
like the giant bug eating the carrot?
13like that one
but that bug is cute
I don't know about you, but I find that picture cute. But to each his own.
Maybe its just not her taste ^^
anypony up for some left 4 dead 2?
My sister is afraid of spiders.
I usually ignore Meanwhile though. Except for the off chance that we are included in a discussion with one another.
for some reason i read that as: my people are afraid of spiders
Well, my sister counts as "people" so it works both ways :D
But people is a more general term
strange.... i must be getting tired
Even more strange, it's ten to one in the morning and I'm still not quite so tired yet.
Then again, I'm used to being up this late :P
Polydunami /) PST Brohoof!
Polydunami: my brother too, although he's gotten better over the years
Panda /)
Yeah, sometimes I'm better with the time but lately, I've been going to bed later.
Polydunami no schooling for you ^^
Oh yeah, it's October now
O_o october FEST!
Yeah, no school. Just pure and utter boredom :S
13oh good my GPU temperature sensor is broken
13it thinks it's -999C
O_o
lol
that absoulte zero
Nitrogen cooling system?
you could overclock the crap out of that thing
Pfft. Absolute zero is disproven xD
13you can't get colder than -273C
Antarctic I mean then.
13core temp is 56C
Oh my
13i doubt the GPU is three times below absolute zero
Thats about optimal levels though, right?
13not really
1350 is better, 45 even better
So that's about 132-133 F
13below 40 is best
hm... mine never runs below 40...
13above 60 is expected when asuka's working hard, above 70 is danger level
im always at 45-55 C
1380 and above trigger overheat shutdowns
Shizuka, not if you disable them. but I dont see who would want that.
13i need asuka to last many many many years
13cause i am not going back to kimiko with 2GB of ram and a barely functional GPU
13neither of which can be upgraded
:/
Oh man.
Just a small question; how do you find your core temperature for your computer or laptop?
Im back and got me som oranges and some cut up apples and made some Peanut Butter sandwhich
So, asuka is the most powerful of the three machines Shizuka?
13coretemp
13http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/
13asuka's the most recent, october 2010
13kimiko is from 2008, server is from who knows when
Polydunami coretemp or speedfan work good... though there are quite a bit of programs that monitor the temp of your HDD's and GPU's
Is Shizu the unicorn? :D
Yeah
So Shizuka is wide-eyed and Vivi is... I want to say seductive? I dunno :S
Which reminds me; I haven't seen much of Vivi lately.
Polydunami, correct. I wouldnt say seductive though.
Maybe sly
13vivi's having hard drive problems
Polydunami: her computer went belly up
aww :(
Dang
That's a shame
Shizuka: say hi to her for all of us :)
Indeed
Polydunami, I would just say older and more mature. Well, I'm basing this on the anime style drawing of eyes >.>
Oh my
good night but not yet morning everyone
133am, sleep time
night OneTrickPony|homewor :)
night Shizuka
I better get to bed too then XD
no I am not sleeping
And on that note, I shall go to bed myself :3

Hey guys whats your option to this should i leave my username as Moopy or how about P3ANUTSMUGGLER
Moopy is better :D
P3anutsmuggler... Interesting.... Hm... Moopy is easier to comprehend, and looks better on the eyes.
has anyone here been on bronystate longer than a year?
Oh ok...............but whats wronge with P3ANUTSMUGGLER?
Moopy: too much all caps
Personally, the all caps is bad
Yeah, caps = eye sores.
oh ok then i won't do P3ANUTSMUGGLER then
does anyone remember who started bronystate?
OneTrickPony|Mandari: OFF TO GOOGLE! :P
lol
I think it might have been Ghosties OneTrickPony|Mandari
It was just here, like the big bang.
ah yes SirSprinkles
Just took humans a bit to find it from the rest of the sites.
I remember the good ol' days
Good ol' days when Flash animation was the best thing to come into our lives.
