DERPY..

they better not dare do any of those
there wasnt a second one yet, but theyve already confirmed a third
I just started to love pinkie after this song
Toy story 3 wrapped it up
O.o
Tom Hanks says they're doing Toy Story 4
no they aint
What the fuck is there to go on with 4?
NO TOY STOY
damn look it all the credits
it ended so well with 3!
NOPE
1 4 will just ruin the great way they wrapped it up imo
NO
i didnt like 3
NO TOY STORY 4 IN MY MIND
only 1 and 2
My friend Asked me if I wanted a big mac from Mc donalds. I said: EEYUP.
damn whats wrong with my typing?
lol
a 4*
There is litteraly NOTHING to build on with a fourth
dat credits
they should at least reveal themselves
inb4 Toy Story 4 is directed by michael bay
No toy story 4. they finished it off nicely
^
pinkie is needed on COD stat we ahve haters inbound
like in the How should Toy Story 3 have ended
spitfire: Oh boy... EXPLOSIONS!
were is tom
anyone watched that?
they need a UP 2 or somethin
Toy Story 3 brought nostalgia. A 4th would be kicking a dead horse
yeah
what we need is an Incredibles 2
YEAAAAAAAAAAAH!
steroids pony
there will be no fourth
ya lol
Lunar_Brony, it brought NOstalgia in a harsh way
i thought 3 was meh
yeah
WE need to watch Beating a dead horse with a stick.
So every Pixar movie but Incredibles, the one that could use a sequel?
SO MANY FEELS
speaking of movies that got dragged out too far:
oh wow it's like watching a bunch of youtube comments being posted in real time holy crap
ahahaha
Lunar_Brony, or bringing a dead horse back from the dead to kill it again
madagascar
The are making that monsters INC prequel
RAWRity there was a video game that acted kinda like a sequel

Azuredragon I'm not so sure about that one
afro circus song was annoying -_-
Are we talkign about crappy kids shows over the past year/
00,10so this seemed silly
I did not wait 10years for Toy Story 3 and cry at its climax, for there to be a Toy Story 4, no just no

derpy_pony: Asking question, not making declaration...

THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU
Batman always makes me tear up.
SpadeMagnes[R]: Jokes about what?
Buytoast, karma will come back and bite you
:L
what about me?
Did anyone watch the new Batman yet? I got to see the whole trilogy for $15 at my theatre
people make jokes about the titanic
oni_link the "Dark Night Rises" shoot out in Denver
SpadeMagnes[R]: Thats horrible
it happens
pony_9001, especially you
ew
MAGYPSIE
Just commandeer the illegal Mother 3 translation and release it on the cheap on 3ds E-shop, Nintendo
sadly
oh god
Soultu yeah, bu tthis was a shoot out
Buytoast: I hope you burn in hell for that
IT'S SIMPLE! WE KILL THE AUDIANCE
/me shudders
D:
Best character in the game
the Titanic is old news, we can make fun of it now
Lunar_Brony: I don't think death should be made fun of
oh god make it stop
what difference does it make? both times people died
Well so far, "The Dark Knight Rises" isn't a compelte bomb. however, it has caused some rough nights for people.
WHAT THE FAK IS THIS
did you know the guy actually said he was the joker i was like wow what an ass
The translation is NOT illegal. The IPS file requires you to obtain your own ROM
its all wrong
"It's simple, we kill the audiance" -Joker
Tetris!
like 9/11 I guess
dat cover
i joke about 9/11 too
joke about it like 9/11
is sumica still streaming?
Tetris Type B
:P
I. Love. Tetris.
pony_9001: God I hate you
pony_9001 please stop making joke about this stuff
9/11 jokes are just plane funny
OH YES\\
Goodnight everybody! I love you all.
Whos streaming???
;p;
Insensitive assholes
night pikorar
00,10ok how about I start baning for the jokes in poor taste?
|We haven't had Sea Ponies yet, so Sumica's still going
Where are the mods when we need them
Hey where did sumica's pony go?
9/11 jokes make me explode with laughter
Poor taste is a matter of opinion
alright alright
@Sumica: PERFECT!
I'm out of here... good night
Sumica, you should start 20 minutes ago
Sumica: sounds wonderfull...
um ok
Anne Franky, holocaust jokes are unfunny too.
xxMoopyxx, please don't start
Well how about too soon then
pony_5354 Buytoast Silver_Storm please do not make jokes about things like that
what
gnight everypony who is going to bed
i still like how im the only one with a Q in thier name
think about it like this: if you had a family member die in some incident, would you like for other people to joke about it?
humor is the medicine of the soul
Yay Tybe A for a moment
So... Two Jews walk into a bar.... hurr durr.. Funny thing is, Jews Don't Drink. *Cricket Cricket* Why do I try anymore?
13we don't find it funny
anything can be funny if you're willing to let it
*type
well your medicen sucks
alright alright
Buytoast: Burn in hell
...how'd the discussion get to this again?
Why are you being all like that dude?
hell most likely doesn't exist
Making light of tragedy is better that dwelling on it and moping.
than*
aaaaaaaaaaaannnnnd chat got really fucking stupid all of a sudden..
why not just not think about it?
yeah i dont like Buytoast but hell aint there
13how about you don't
yup
Guys Guys! Love N' Tolerate! I sense a argument.
00,10or just dont bring it up is a setting such as this.
I doubt the family of the victims would think the same
:(
00,10no one else was talking about it
shamroc i agree
It not like we're going to learn anything from the tragedy.
Firelight, some things are simply intolerable
Im not starting anything
I dont even like talking about it
when you joke about something like that, you are still reminding people of it
but there's a time frame needed before it can be made fun of
well to be honest, someone did bring up the shootings
I don't see a point at poking fun at real life tragedies. Lets not bring that nonsense here
Sumica can we please drift away from the topic? It makes me uncomfortable
IT's just me and my obscure sense of humor. I've gotta remember "normal" people don't find it as amusing.
but the 9/11 was sudden i'll admit
we know xxMoopyxx
OK OK.. Lets just all calm down.. And watch.
Shall we/
know what that im pinging him?
gentelmen
Minecraft?

i know thats what i said dude so chill out man
Buytoast Comedy = tragedy + time. I'm just early :P
pony_9001 Buytoast please stop. I'm getting uncomfortable
8,6how about you don't bring it up, or I can solve your issue about not talking about it from my end
when the sun is going down, there is always this music
Hey guys, I have a random question.
abrony: very good sir /)
this is seriously Minecraft
when i finish my story, "Captain ponyfag and Randall the Furry Wonder", i'll be sure to make sure you won't be part of it
yus
AttacktheAndalite go ahead
Its minecraft BGM
we are bronys and we need to try to find a find a way around this and maybe we can work this out
8,6that applies to both of you
This is totally minecraft.

Love and tolerate
d3rb_: I tried that but I'm having trouble with that one. I don't know what the address would be for this server and all that.

*Tries to enjoy Stream but people keep argueing about comedy.* :(
now oni respect his wishs to not bring it up

I want to ENJOY my life
I read Rainbow Factory, and it's not that scary, really
abrony: Don't even thing about it.

/me respects everypony here and wants them all to be happy
:O:D

OK OK im just saying

How Do You Write Italic Cartigoraphy on bronystate : l
OohShiny: read raibow factory? isn't it a song?
13so many trolls tonight
oh silly newfoals can't read ...
pony_9001 some people are sensitive to these topics
worst of them all.
13i should just start banning

It is a bit crowded though today~
Underwater :)
Ah well
Firelight, yes
world 2-2
Firelight eeyup. Underwater
Underwater theme
13if you have been here for months then you should well know our rules
CrimsonPheonix: How?
mario
Lunar_Brony: that on fimfiction?
Oh!
dat remix
well ima go goodbye everypony
Yeah.
How sad is it, that as I have been cleaning up all my shelves and the area around my desk, that I keep finding empty garbage bags... you know, from when I decided to do this before and put it off! :D I hav not had to run for a garbage bag since Bronystate started! :D
OK GOT IT.
Cya abrony~
night abrony
bye abrony
All right this awesome
the only rules i know are about the newsletter and such
Please stop talking about creepy stuff it MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE. I am up at two in the morn all by myself please stop:'(
00,10this guy has great covers
Big_Macintosh_1992 yes. It's not for the faint of heart. Rated mature for gore and swearing
Buytoast, read up on them
sue soes Sumica
*does
Lunar_Brony: pfft, faint of heart XD
Nyeh?
00,02ok, i downgraded to 0.15, lets see if i cant make it download a not corupted zip
YEAH TOAST!
What happened?
11,01BRB
at first i thought it was my phone cuz i got the same notification notice
yeah yeah 'no profanity", "no rudeness", "LUV N TOLERAT"
I don't even think this guy plays guitar... Lol.
13not sure if i should knockout and timeban or just permaban and let them appeal it out
I like his Explorer. Explorer is best guitar
sniffle...:(
Buytoast: thats failure right there >been here for months >havnt read rules...
so what's with the guitar videos
:O
xxMoopyxx I'm configuring with my toaster to play that when it starts up
you clearly did not read the rules
What did they do?
Buytoast it's awesome
13very inappropriate jokes
THe rules would be alot simpler if they just comprised of "Don't get the mods ticked off at you"
heh ok
/me hugs Chachamuffin "it'll be ok"
this isn't the place for dark humor, just respect that. plz k thanks
00,10guess no one knows this one
Buytoast: Is so tasty!!!
oh gawd G/S/C surfing theme!!!!!
...
i get enough guitar with my brother all the time
13this isn't #brony, we have standards
ehhh time ban probably
Timeban 'em. Let 'em cool their heels for a bit.
okay thats it if its just gonna be gutitars and arguing (i love gutars but im very tired so IM OUT EVERY PONY
Pokemon surfing music
:)
well said Shizuka
pony_9001 but then nopony would know how not to tick off the mods
@Shizuka: thank you!
Sumica: I guessed first
00,10damn Shizuka, you realy are a pyro
what happened to the showings of cowboy bebop and that accel world thing
Chachamuffin: thats better lol
Thanks Hatchet
did those wrap up?
Hoenn Surf theme?
well there was video called YEAH TOAST1 based on TF2
pony_9001, even if that was the only rule, YOU STILL FAILED
It would probably be more effective than a permaban, in the long run. A permaban would get them angry and they'd either leave or whine about it in e-mail.
no prob Chachamuffin
13all around the country, coast to coast
Shizuka lemme guess. "Be polite. Be efficient. Have a plan to glomp everypony you meet."
pony_9001 that's not a rule, that is called common sense
A timeban is more like a time-out.
good night everypony the ARGUEING GETS US NOTHING SO SO YALL LATER
GabeMoist: miserably at that
g'night Quick_Thinker
night Quick_Thinker
/me is downloading an FiM soundboard on her phone.

<3
cool
Lord... maybe I'm just a troll at heart... I'm getting people mad at me and I'm not even trying to
I know that song
night, Quick_Thinker
if i keep egging people on, will i get banned again?
is not mad
is it sadidk this one?
Buytoast most likely
well you could always kick him, drive him mad and let them make something dumb worth a permaban
Darn, I dont know this one

13SuperBrony64: well... i don't want to brag..
13i don't want to boast..
00,10aye CrimsonPhoenix
I know this is sort of mean but.. This guy looks like a Douchebag.
Crimson it depends on there nature about certain things. like how creepy stuff eeally shakes me up.
SuperBrony64: i dont want to boast
Huh, and here I assumed you'd get tired of them after a while :P Well, deal with it as you see fit. I trust the Bronystate mods know what they're doing.
goddammit not the toast thing again
AttacktheAndalite, get my little wallpaper

11,02MW3 didn't win ;~;
i said the song name first :P
Eh, I just can't do MMOs. I've been through a couple, none of them stick.
did borderlands win?
what did?
Wow, been a while since I was on here
SuperBrony64, You don't need that re-harsh
Borderlands won
/me uses Firelight as a Ping Pong ball
YES
It's ok SuperBrony64
BORDERLANDS
No draw. I think it's the format; no real all-consuming story.
Yes it didn't win HA! i know it sucked
now i can buy it
and Borderlands is more fun
Superbrony64: MLP Won.. MLP ALWAYS Wins..
Mirror's Edge's Still Alive < Portal's Still Alive
Too many sidequests that don't really mean anything.
11,01SuperBrony64: Dammit.
Too much time spent collecting twenty bear asses.
Buytoast - gotta give it a half hour for the old sale to expire, of courser
eh
did ya try the troubleshooting CrimsonPhoenix
i can wait
?
oni_link, not now
k
I don't even have the game
lol
Borderlands is awesome
hands down
Cans.wave
looks like i'm going to get out of steam summer sales relatively unscathed though...
I can't wait for Borderlands 2
got Just Cause 2 for $5, and i'll grab Borderlands for $7.50
MirrorImage: Me too, twenty bucks is all i spent
if you haven't bought the binding of issac yet you obviously don't like fun
and that'll be the only damage, minus anything awesome tomorrow
Anyone get Recettear?
I do
had a good time too, small server and i was one of the 5 people who play priest lol
SOMEONE MUST STREAM RECETTEAR
xxMoopyxx: Why the cans.wav rage?
8,6well, I already had it
BEST GAME
Eh, the only thing I bought recently was Bayonetta. That one was fun.
the only thing I bought during the sale was "Poker Night at the Inventory"
kirzstryfe: i have it as well..
Borderlands is only $7.50?
i don't know
kirzstryfe had what?
I got a Game Over on Recettear ;____;
now i just got to delete duke nukem forever off my computer
8,6not sure if it would handle streaming well, think it only has a fullscreen option
I lost my house
More ponies?
8,6lol
kirzstryfe, I saw it streamed
Portal 2 Now you're gone
lol portal 2
Nope.
Buytoast KILL IT! KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!
I WIN
darn it
Civ 5 Gods and Kings is 25% off - is that as low as it's been?
eeyup
eh, i enjoyed duke nukem forever
8,6Recettear is fun, but definitely needs a solid block of time to kill if you want to play
i wouldn't reccomend it
or replay it
kirzstryfe, Recettear should have windowed
but it was fun for a run
oh u gotta luv portal
want you gone
LittleBigPlanet Karting Beta
CrimsonPhoenix: don't glout
Portal 2? IDK
is the actual title
I hear Want You Gone
11,01I can get into Recettear in spurts.
Spectrum_Rush|, it's all in good fun
:P
Friend Asks what's your favorite animal. Accadentaly Says Fluttershy. :[
I don't play enough games like that
don't worry I'm good sport
Firelight Fluttershy is a tree, silly filly!
CrimsonPhoenix: is a RD :D but a good sport
Firelight: But it's truuuuue.
that's one nice thing about gw2, has a personal story system for each character based on the starting choices you make
I also got Dungeon Defenders
Lunar_Brony: .....................Oh.
Nah, MMO plots really don't draw me.
plus all of the side quests are "pick one of 5 different things, do any mix of them in a certain area"
I mean theoretically they would, but I can't muster the suspension of disbelief.
00,10one last song
k
No MMO can perfectly recreate the feeling of being in a fantasy world.
now i only want you gone
this is it
the final song
11,01Sumica: Minus the Sea Ponies outro?
this is . ..
HEAVEN OR HELL LET'S ROCK
THE FINAL COUNTDOWN
Sumica: let it be long as hell lol
And too much dealing with stupid players standing around in squares trying to play the game like some kind of sport.
now i only want you gone
:D
chill out
dr mario
buck yeah
uh
I prefer single player adventures because of the greater control over the narrative.
HatchetRyda then let it be a Meat Loaf song
lol
This guy.. I hate him so much. He is a douchebag. He dosn't even play in every one of his videos.. HE just plays the song and makes it look like he is singing it.. Sorry for hating.. But it's true.
you answered before I could hear it
Hmm...
This song
Singing? PLaying*
LOL
Lunar_Brony: or a metallica lol
00,10singing?
I love great single player rpg's, but I don't have enough time to really get into them the way I used to
@Sumica: Ikr?
dr mario?
HatchetRyda true
very true
Modeabel: yep
and I haven't seen many pop up lately that seemed worth picking up
i don't even know who this freak is, all i know is that something is making these screeching sounds
11,01Hesitated on Dungeon Defenders. Don't think I'll play that enough.
i'll play it with you
trust me
Same here.
Especially the ones that kick you in the ass repeatedly. Many strategy RPGs.
Fire Emblem repeatedly pisses me off.
youre a doctor
oni_link I was gonna say that . . .
The last RPG I actually completed...was Final Fantasy 6. Now there's a game with a fun system.
Medic Mario
Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Magicka or Borderlands?
Nittany_Discord, I originally wasn't going to get it, but my brother made me
00,10Wow Buytoast you are quite the judgemental poS arnt you
all three
Lunar_Brony: lol great minds think alike :D
Evil_Spike: Human Revolution.
i am
but then again
i'm also an asshole
Can't, only $15 in my Steam Wallet
00,02Evil_Spike, deus ex
/me laughs
Righto
[02:39] <Buytoast> i'm also an asshole
8,6couldn't tell :3
i forget that many don't like JRPG
:O
Well that's as much an admission of guilt as you can get.
I love them
oni_link IMPOSSIBRU!! If they did, you would be 15 and skipping down a busy street while listening to "Smile Smile Smile"
They just kind of melt together after a while
take loads of time to complete
11,01You should make a wallet out of things other than condensed hot water.
and on top of that the good ones, like Tales, never get localized.
13taking too much restraint to not timeban buytoast now..
and not giving one buck about other's opinions
Hmm, Nittany_Discord, Dungeon defenders is actually pretty nice. Got a good build up and stuff
00,02Evil_Spike, if you can get the collection thats even better
Sad Sad Sad
Hey?
oh mah god i said we should watch this earlier!
If you're having to restrain yourself, go for it.
just lots and lots of content that you need to buy <___<
This ain't Seaponies
well he did say he was banned before
Awesome anime :)
but on a more serious note Dungeon defenders is pretty entertaining if you have people to play it with
otherwise it's dull
He's obviously being an asshole if you've got one finger on the ban-noodle.
Lunar_Brony: I would but G4 wasnt around when I was 15 :P
nah
LOL dat silly Applejack
what anime is this from?
Anyway, Tales
CrimsonPhoenix: Those are coming
Oh do not even start with that crap dude don't even start with that shit
Loved Tales of Symphonia, even though I never completed it.
this is samuri shamploo
alright what chinese game show is this supposed to be?
pony95901: Samurai Champloo
pony95901: samurai champloo
Endearing art style, quality writing for a JRPG

I had a really bad Monday this week... Gotta beg to stay at my place for another month cause the apartment I'm getting is a month away from being available, My galsses broke, Spent my whole paycheck on bills, and my car filled with electrical smoke as I was driving to pay them! :O Ponies made it better though! :)
Nittany_Discord, he got to the moon, now he faces his next greatest challenge: Climbing ladders
TheRandomkid321: good luck :)
ssssss luna landing remindes me of black ops
Nittany_Discord, that may be true, but now he cant get into the ship in the first place :)
00,02Nittany_Discord, i think Sumica made it
Are we streaming any shows anymore?

Just in case things go bad, but I have a letter from the landloard saying they have an apatment, they just won't be able to provide access till Sept 1. Ponies keeps me happy in a very stressful week! :)
i wonder if the bigger parts make bigger explosion 0.0
Can the Kerbal exit mid-flight?

Go straight to LittleBigPlanet Craft World
GabeMoist that would prove interesting
YES
LBP XD

phase4 put S.A.S modul on the top of the other barrels
bob: fins?
123 online
00,02y u fall appart
00,02bob, dont need it
Awwww
00,02not the problem
:/
dang Reactor tried to kill ratchet
yes
goodness
YES
looks like the russian nuke from that movie
he's built a MIRV!
DIZZYRATCHET: And someone knows where my name comes from. Didn't expect that.
i beat reactor in 3 seconds
lol
it's spinning like it's in swan lake or something hot damn
DIZZYRATCHET: He was the best boss.
4real
holy crap its going for the base
nvm its fine :#
:3
random how i got that reactor thing in my head
parachute plus rocket. Problem, physics?
hahahaha
DIZZYRATCHET: I honestly never expected anyone to get the reference
its a smokey
ok moopy
bronystate is a cool place, it entertains me and doesnt afraid of anything
at least fall off the ladder and break a leg
it was random. u really got it from ratchet and clank
I wonder... morosely...
its breaks...
lol
if the addition of the ladder added just enough dissymmetry to throw off rockets.
how does it move???
waht in the
roll away home with you
Roll to the launch pad
lol
00,02well i dont know why this wont work
USE PIE
DIZZYRATCHET: I really did
maybe they little guys are secretly messing with ur rocket when your not looking
try turning on your rcs this time?
did not see that coming
bob: scumbag kerbals :D
Is there stream
hey guys
:D
hai Phase stream
they sorta look like they could be gremlins, I suppose.
JRP2234[iPhone]: There is stream
JRP2234[iPhone]: yep Phase is streaming Kerbal Space Program
hi Chrysalis
ah i know there plan now
Sumica.........im gonna go watch MLP for a little bit ok so talk to you in a little while ok sorry about the big chat fight that you had to hear
ok moopy
Phase4: the developers know you are a master at this game , so they introduced a special coding that will make your rockets just fail repeatedly
gru sent the minions to take phase's rocket parts
so many oks and so few punctuation
youR write bob, when something goes wrong, always add pie :D!!!!!!!!........ unlesss that object is potentially explosive. oh.
I'm calling it a night. Gonna shower and crash. Chat next week! :)
Just to calm me down for a bit
Spectrum_Rush|: which is why his patch failed the last time :D
00,02Spectrum_Rush|, :O
yes pie always solves the answer XD
what on earth?
new KSP update?
bye richfiles
gtg bye
Chrysalis: eeyup
bye Soultu
bye u to
don't worry Phase4 ya'll can some stupid little coding likety split :)
omg they can escape :O
*beat
minions
00,02making sure ladder works
thats amazing
i wish i had this game just so i could launch these little santa's rejects off from 5k meters in the air
maybe the kerbal is heavy that it throws the rocket off lol
when your sad... fix it, with PIE. when your mad... fix it with PIE, hard mathproblem, fix it.... with PIE. handling explosive, fix it with.... actually, not such a good idea
fly to luna
do they scream or is this game a quiet one?
the ladder is my half-baked theory. I'll explore it myself in a couple days when my new comp gets here xD
Math problems dont get fixed with pie
/me curls up next to Shizu and tries to get some sleep..
they get fixed with pi
They may add sounds to them possibly ya never know
Who is streaming
pi
JRP2234[iPhone]: Phase
JRP2234[iPhone] Phase4 is currently streaming
chrysalis, i was talking about mathimatical pie.... 3.1415926
/me 13throws a blanket over rain rain~<3
creeperhugger10 thats pi
mathematical pi doesn't taste that good.
not pie
i know, its a play on words
oh no
what the hell appen
it's the bleed all over again
i looked away for 5 secs
they need to move more
and it would be perfect
oh dear god *turns off the stream* yup. time for sleeps.
Oh god why
Welcome to Shame Central
^^^
flip and flam???
thank you for the blanket, Shizu dear~
NOOOO
/me facehoof
they need music
i think they are shy a lil
and I believe they mix up the lyrics
:'(:'(:'(:'(:'(
i can see it
It wouldn't be bad if they had a stage. And music. And other people around them. And props.
It wouldn't be bad if it were bad.
they need derpy
Well, I give them props for even doing this
derpy will atract a crowd
if it weren't bad.
They're not too bad
the only good thing in this video is their articulation
sandvich sandvich sandvich sandvich
not as bad as mlp live
._.
hurry, play the brony documentary thing now
Modeabel: o,o
Modeabel: NOTHING is as bad as mlp live
Buytoast, what?
nini Shizu~<3
the one that's like 20 mins of shame
*claps one* whoa sandwhich WHERE *CLAPS MAORE*
13nacht rain rain~<3
oh there's many of that
/me 13falls asleep by the fireplace~
gotta be ore specific
/me falls asleep by Shizu~
the one that starts out with the tone deaf guy with the neck beard singing winter wrap up
shizuka, witch rain aare you talking about?
i hope they add deceals in ksp new update or somthing
creeperhugger10...
yes
:|
lol
lulz
@_@
bob: that is a good diea
also, which*
CAN I SNUGGLE TOOO?!?!?!?!
no, go away
wat
i would put "this rocket is now 20% cooler" then RD cutie mark next to it
bob: and hope it doesn't explode?
._.
/me pucnhes creeperhugger10 "stop bugging Rain"
it will explode
twice
explosions aren't uncool, though, so its fitting
this can only end well
DIZZYRATCHET: probably
well i will test it then put the sticker on :$
mine would be the ss derp
wow, fickle crowd. :(
creeperhugger10: how so?
what shall we do as we watch
laugh?
ok
sing?
cry?
hahahahaha
suddenly people buying burnout paradise
:'(
wasnt it free for a while
lalala
Chrysalis: I thought it was
what type of question is that, why dont you scroll up and check what has been fickle
i thought they added stickers already becuase in the new trailer they have "how hard can rocket science be anyway"
well, free on origin
Here we go
I would play LBPK Beta
and... dead
WTF?
lol
oh yes
Chrysalis: also didnt they close the servers for that game?
glorious
freeze
told u
oni_link nope
wa happen
2 much power
Chrysalis: oh wait, thats the console versions lol
creeperhugger10, nothing was fickle.. you seem to have been trying and failing to make fun of me. I saw nobody condoning it or anything >_>
11,02Wait, why is everyone buying Burnout?
becuase there are explosion
thats why
SuperBrony64|GAMES: iunno.....
Made buy Michael Bay
00,02staging fail
kingdom hearts gummi(mlp reference) ship
That was pretty cool
rain rain go away, take a JOKE another day
damn did this game turn ito real life now
love explosions
oh gog internet y u no faster ?
creeperhugger10: harsh
DIZZYRATCHET: i miss the gummi builder
how very creative of you, creeperhugger10
those gummi ship fights were better than the rest of the game
DIZZYRATCHET: its not just guns
MY CHILDHOOD
it flies @_@
Chrysalis: i dunno about that but it was freaking awesome nonetheless
wel saying that i live in a cave, it is extremely creative
Rain he is cool like that ?
.... suspence
its moving @_@
So much hostility today >~>
and such a slow spin
i like to log on to bronystate at night becuase ppl arent crazy at night
we're not crazy?
yup
depends on where you are when "night" counts
its probably morning for most here
in the afternoon ppl text a new message every 4 secs
im pretty insane, sry
its like @_@ omg
technically 1:30 is "morning" I suppose.
bob: even tonight thoug, its usually more calm than this
yea
well its a weekend
Chrysalis 03:32 here ...
4:30 am here
time for eurobronies to do nothin at all
same
to spaaaaace
10:32AM here
1:32 here
0932 here
finally ive stopped being pinged for everytime someone used my name
its 900394394 over here
4:33am here
bob: Its over nine thousannnnnnnd
3:33 am
I KNOW ITS AMAZING
1:33
XD
433 east coast
USA i mean
creeperhugger10: No, you still get pinged.
9000 is lucky #
1 34 here
im from mars thats why
lol
think thats annoying, creeperhugger10? try getting a ping every time someone decides to talk about the weather or "chocolate rain" :\
bob: mars has its own time zone and rules haha
00,02wow
00,02big rockets dont have much fuel
lol
wouldnt they have to capitalize it like this though, Rain?
Phase4: That makes no sense big rockets should have more fuel
it makes an obnoxious "ding" when someone types your name
oni_link, no
use piss for fuel
chocolate Rain some stay dry and other feel the pain ~
ding
00,02killerpony7733, well theres more actual fuel but less you can do with it
really? that annoying then
Hm interesting
*thats
fuel went up but so did mass, ends up a tradeoff.
I get it any time someone says rain. no matter the caps. it could be raIn and it would still do it
wow, that really sucks
Rain if you use mIRC or some other client you can configure the pings to be cap sensitive
yeah I know
whats a good IRC client for android anyways?
>_> my dad just walked in then stared at me agian >_>
or you could do as I do. Make up a name people are unlikely to type in casual conversation. xD
my guinea pig is chewing on my toes
you can also set up extra things to count as pings
but then I wouldnt get anything when Shizu says rain rain
funny i'm only pinged when Spectrum_Rush| infull is typed
well, technically I stole it, but still
00,02this rockets gona be slow
rain
yes, Chrysalis, I know
rain
Rain add rain~ and that should do the trick
rain
i get pinged when somoene says spongebob
rain
or bobbed thier heads
ding ding ding!
you know, nick spamming is kickable
why do some of us have "odd" pets
we wub you to Rain
creeperhugger10: dude leave her alone man...
3 times not in all caps isnt really spamming
I don't have an odd pet. But my cat has a pet human. :/
i got pet tank
Spectrum_Rush|: thats what baffles me, i only get ping'd when people use my name with the underscore
it is annoying though
Hey guys i have something to tell you all
wow, more fickleness
yes a toy tank that i programmed
it doesnt have to be all caps for it to be spam. just saying.
what's that, xxMoopyxx
yes?
inb4 a deep life changing revelation
dat accelleration
3 times just one word spaced out does nt really count as spam
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: inb4 your insane
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/7/14/d6sM8JY4PkGhGMSmzU8aRQ2.jpg
inb4 your.... dammit Shamroc

Chrysalis: macapony
Shamroc i'm sorry i think your sarcasm detector is failling

creeperhugger10: its not really up for you to decide that...if the mods think its spam..then its spam
00,02watch dis
Ok im watching MLP right? butthis guy on the commentary hes a anti brony he said that hes not going to watch the MLP episodes
aannd its somthing i dont really care about
okay and?
lol
anti bronies don't watch MLP ? who knew this ? does obama know ?
he said he wont when he did
lol
dat lunar orbit Phase4
Ugh........well his youtube channel name is TZB43
how uninteresting
luna time
almost there!..
Phase4 how are you able to control in map
im not saying they cant think that, or i get a choice, but my opinion is its not really spam and if it was, very minor
Shamroc get your sarcasm detector fixed btw
00,02bob, thing on the bottim
00,02bottom'
if you raise the navball you can pilot from map mode
00,02click the small grey arrow
oh
its all good anyway, creeperhugger10
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: yeah...i think i busted it when i was trollin the hell outa an anti-brony on tf2....do you know any-pony i can ask to get it fixed?
00,02orbit or land?
land
xxMoopyxx: it sounds like a closet brony, theres more of them than you think

00,02well i meen orbit then land or just land
Shamroc nope

Been all over it, haven't seen one dark maned alicorn.
/me doesn't abuse the ping system
i wonder mars is called in this game
Rain can i ping you cause you're awesome :D ?
lol
no mars yet, unless it's in the new update
I guess >_>
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: can i ping you cause YOUR awesome? oh wait no i cant...your not awesome hehe
sram thats the new mars in kerbal XD
Rain you're awesome :D
Shamroc you just did :p
Phase4: i've got the gifs on hand :)
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: no i didnt....your insane!
And this is what he said "sonic rainboom? No. /totally not watching every single one of these commentaries in reverse order instead of doing homework" thats what he said
see i was right AHA!
bob yes, fits the naming theme, along with labrek :P
land now
Shamroc again :p
messaged on steam
00,02not much power in this rocket
00,02might not be able to get home
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOUR TALKING ABOUT
have you guys seen the This Day Aria literal?
there, now I might be able to get some sleep now that I dont have to deal with creeperhugger10
Phase4: if you had followed the orbit first, what would have been the benefit of doing so?
00,02oni_link, not sure
Shamroc u sure ? i can swear you are pinging me ...
man advantage to setting up an orbit is being able to better pick a landing zone.
oh, was i typing too LOUD? lol
Night Rain Sleep well
TheGreatAndPowerfulT...no your just insane...like i inb4'ed eairlier..
night, TheGreatAndPowerfulT
otulp= pluto
bye rain
well he posted that comment
Shamroc okay ...
night rain and GPT
i'm not going anywhere btw
Im not sure if TheGreatAndPowerfulT is going to bed
ok sorry
bob: but Pluto isn't a planet, silly :)
sleep tight Rain
pluto is best planet
eeyup
ah who cars it kerbal anything is possible : D
its more of a planet than I am.
i havnt slept for 20 years
cher3ry: That is true.
00,02SHIT
creeperhugger10: must be a robot...
But its a good thing that i did not become a anti brony
@_@
cyberpony
bob: mars is sram?
00,02too fast
00,02not sure if live
i just made that up
D:
XD
00,02oh wow
"COMING IN HOT!"
EJECTS @_@
bob: you had me fooled :D
lol what if it explodes
00,02lucky
dat weak thrust
: P
that thrust is probrably for rover
BOOOOOOOOM
so is that yellow meter the fuel?
00,02now we play the waiting game
disregard my last commend if you dont know portal
tictoc
xmasskills,

elevator music remindes me of ------>:P
slowwwww down!
almost
And here we are
Phase4: http://derpy.me/UpX2Y http://derpy.me/VS4q7 http://derpy.me/Bw2y2 http://derpy.me/9nyDL http://derpy.me/0CquI http://derpy.me/2kyWv ;)

one small mstep for kerbal, one giant leap for kerbkind!
speech
ALL THEM LUNA PICS
YAY
er, what
ikr
all my love <3
luna approoves the landing
they came to explore in peace, and now there they shall rest in peace. wait, wrong speech, damnit!
So many Lunas <3<3<3<3
cher3ry: :D
ikr
i do it evry time
o.o
Oh, yeah. Yesterday was the 43rd anniversary of the moon landing
XD hes gonna do it
<3PORTAL,<3 companion cube,<3 bronies
wait...
here he goes @_@
lmao :D
im ready
this is so FUN
XDDDD
HERE IT COMES!
:)
:D
LOL
lmao
Or fall
lol
XD
YAY
dat leap
:D
it was really well synced before he fell on his back :D
now to find Luna
woo hoo
dat jetpack
where luna
i can see the multiplayer now
speech
the other ppl can ride in ur rocket and explore and build a base
nice walk
bob: 0x10^c
"getting bored of space"
Phase4 weres the kerbal flag
Phase4 in charge of Rocket Science
Phase4
space the final frontier
yahhhnnnnn
walk to the dark side of the mun and see if he freezes
i heard about that game Reactor
bob: you should pitch your ideas to the dev team o,o
not the cold
i know right o.o
wot
where to next
ksp multiplayer would be epic and mun bases :;)
next we go to cheeze world XD
yay
dont forget the mun rocks phase
ok, quickly, cut his O2 tank!
So... do they realise that they probably won't be getting home?
can i put the moon i a cheese grader?
make it look like an accident
how will he get out
MOOOOOOOOOOOOON
lol
dat jetpack
group pic yay
bob: cheeseworld final boss http://www.i-mockery.com/romhacks/smb2-xmas/mouser.gif
rocks arent very comfy
dad, are you mun?
XD
that mouse
You have to leave at least one kerbal there, otherwise someone might jack your rocket.
bob, ikr XD
luna wants out
hi everypony
Hi, somepony_else
kermah?
who's gonna steal our rocket? We're on the friggin mun! We're the only ones he... oh hell.
cher3ry: *deeper voice* no son, but you are the best at space and i am proud of you
hi somepony_else
00,02i dont think i can get them home
hi somepony_else
oh
hello somepony_else
thats something else
pwndy
luna will steal
your behind a proxy most likley
maybe they can get escape velocity with their infinite but puny jetpacks.
Phase4: theyre stranded?
cher3ry: There is a lot you don't know...
small button in the bottom right, switch to iris
Phase4 do what apollo did
im not a pony.....
hi Reactor , DIZZYRATCHET, crazypony and oni_link
top hanks got them home
tom*
but your here so :/
lmao :D
and now they shall suffer forever, trapped within a hell of their own ambition
such is the price of fame
00,02bob, unfortunately i dont have tom hanks
bob: But they were already in orbit
no tom hanks ;_;
somepony_else: how are you this day/morning/afternoon/evening ?
aks luna to bring them back
build another rocket, name a crew member tom hanks, send him to save everybody
celestia funded this?
fine, thanks. how are you, oni_link?
yea name a crew member tom hanks or forrest gump
my .13 rockets were named Celestia. My .15s were Lunas. I'll need a new theme for the .16s I guess.
you should leave one there, Phase4. see if he builds a colony
somepony_else: im having a blast here relaxing with everyone. and tomorrow i got to the lake with my parents to beat the heat
imagine he just sits there and the russian space crew just waves at them
00,02XD
no, it was terry pratchet that steered them back to earth, id be surpried if anyone knew that
00,02i'ma start going home
cher3ry: You could always go for classical mathematicians
00,02this will not work but worth a try
bob: that would be soo funny but so cruel :D
can you space walk without being on land?
no
just call tom hanks phase he will giude you @_@
if so, you can totally get them home with their infinite fuel jet packs
Might have to, since there was a madness to my method... my main goal in .13 became to crash into the Sun (impossible as it turned out to be). In .15, it was to land everywhere.
Rain: IKR
landing might be a problem though
you have to be able to have some projection, laws of physics
creeperhugger10, their jet packs...
dat thrust.
Rain: Reentry could be a problem
but rain they dont have parachutes remember
she see 'em trolling she hating........
xmasskills,
00,02this is about as efficent as i can be
I said that, bob
oh ._.
riding dirty
lol
they could be buried on their home planet though. or turned to ash on the way
/me shrugs
why are they screaming they are only going like 2 miles per hour :3
lol
bob: space is scurry :D
because they're only going 2 mph and home is very far away and they forgot to pee before they left
00,02i might be wrong
how many days has he been in space
00,02and we have plenty of fuel
00,02bob, 2
, theyre using jeypacks?, cheeters, and anyway "WALKING"involvs solid ground under one foot at all time
._. wow demo times flies
to the mun and leaving in 2 days? awesome
to escape, yes. To get back home, that remains to be seen.
00,02huh
00,02completly wrong way to take off
@.@
zois and n-body problems.
time for the sun
freeze
I frequently have dreams that I'm working on a moon colony.
y
Flash hates me! FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
MadSurge: it hates me too but welcome :D
hes actually using tom hanks logic @_@
:D
as long as you can get it below 70km you'll eventually get home
whos flash? eems legit
no bob, thats just physics
we see 'em rolling
Rain: Didn't Tom Hanks invent physics?
:|
Also, deployable kerbals? They're new to me!
:|
lol
he made it home
Hey Rain!
MadSurge: yeah Phase got the update
orbite is csed byy the force of gravity in a circular ring, base on mass of orbiting object. and yes, its rocket science
00,02lolwat
kerbals can moonwalk and use jetpacks and lights and exit ship
00,02aparently if you time warp you phase through planets
you shifted into a higher parabolic orbit, technically.
hello, MadSurge
it's projecting your path as if you had taken off on it
Well that can't be good
woohoo, successful moon mission is almost successful!
easy way to get to earth: blow UP
yay he made it home
dam physics, you scary
that dinky rocket ain't gonna help
lol
NOON ONONONON
dont crash
WEEEEEEEEEEEEE *BOOM*
ouch
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
ded
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
;_;
lol
hey ponies :)
NNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I.. think you forgot to put a chute on, Phase4
Well, at least we delivered Luna her pizza :D
man he used the speech and then he crashed ;_;
00,02Rain, no, i had a chute
00,02tried to use it
then you broke it
00,02and then it exploded
XD
let us have a moment of silence for those brave kerbals
sup bronyinstrumental
Exploding parachute XD
thst speech was the best part XD
Phase4 you ever tried to program without booleans?
its a PITA
00,02Chrysalis, wait
that was funny:D
Well, it's past 5am here.
00,02your trying to program without?
im learning C
Goodnight, everyone
there are no booleans
00,02ah
00,02Chrysalis, 0 is false
no classes
bye reactor
night Reactor
00,02everything else is 1
oh yeah
00,02i meen true
but when bool causes a compile error
00,02there are bool types in c11 but you dont realy need them
it gets incredibly frutrating
how many kerbals died
00,02bob, 3
aw
all of them
even the children
yeah, you don't need em tho, just use ints and ==0 means false, !=0 means true
00,02^
name one tom hanks
lol jk
:D
oh yeah, there are easy enough work arounds
but catching myself is getting rather frustrating
Yeah, I did similar when I was first working on a Perl project. Bringing C thinking in, wondering why my functions weren't working quite as expected.
well im shell and i made it out of aperature alive.... yeh, im boss
im bob and i made it out of narnia
never used perl
im oni_link and Im made of awesome sauce
yeh, narnia doesnt have companin cubes!!!!
Tara Stronge and Ashleigh Ball are the best
: D
Im Rain and people like to make puns at my name
moopy back
oh dont Rain on their parades
00,02minmus time
eeyup
derp derp derp
is the stream frozen?
well time for me to go guys
you may be buffering bob
bye DIZZYRATCHET
c you later everypony
I hate solids at ... wow
ill justrefresh
o.o
oh my
rain rain, is the best, rain rain we cnt contest..... and fail
later
00,02not minmus time
der we go
thips game
phase if ur every stuck in space just use the houston we have a problem speech lol
dem astronauts
yay
@_@
o.o
your side rockets are breaking off and hitting the lander..
like a good neighbor, state farm is there
O_O
need to tie em to the center better.
6_9
wow lol
with a new ship
duct tape everything?
lol
dat OC
I think it's because the solids are providing _all_ of the thrust in the first stage... the sides aren't powered, so they're just being dragged along.
stop exploding so loudly, i keep thinking it's one of those puffy bomb mutants trying to blow my ass up
GET TO DA SPACE SHIIIIIIP
I may not be able to make it to Mun, but I can say that I can land on the water tower without any problem, while Phase4 and Sumica can not
do fuel rods fall off in this game/
Rain: :D an incredible feat
00,02Rain, thats true
00,02i think i got there
buytoast, you mean left4dead fat mutants?
00,02once
00,02but i exploded afterwards
:p
00,02the water tower that is
I think I still have a ship on it
00,02Much better
and it has been there for about 11 game years :D
Buytoast you playing dead island?
no
The Binding of Issac
L4d?
ohhh
a buffer monster is attacking me @_@
oh
00,02ok, i broke the staging AGAIN
muuch better
nvm
yehh..., ok, now that makes more sense
annoying little buggers
well that looks safe
lagg
well, a rocket IS just a long tube with a big boom at one end
00,02i have to turn stream of for a sec
cher3ry: lol
finally I can sleep
^
buffer
rain, you type in yo sleep?
00,02i'ma turn it back on soon
k
oh nvm
have to be up early to mow 2 yards tomorrow in 100+ deg weather..
Rain: yikes
that sucks ._.
not getting paid for it either :D
2 yards isnt that much
ouch
but summer
yay it lfies
flies
suddenly music
creeperhugger10 I mean my yard and my grandpa's yard
i really need to get this awsome game
And Ded?
not 2 yards of grass. :|
bob: i do too
I got 6 empty cans in my bed room when i start raging when i bash them around ha ha ha ha whoooooo!
i cannot wait for it to go over 20 bucks @_@
i thought you meant the yard as in yards, cus that would be like 30eet rain
oh goodness
you can do it Phase4 WOOOOOOO
I know what you thought, creeperhugger10. :|
i think i can see the kerbals bobbing there heads inside through the window 0.0
lol
they must like the music
/me reminds herself to keep the ignore on this time
/me pets Rain
um.. >_>
XD
you need to chill :P
lol
anyway, ive been in the aperature scienceinsinrator room and thats.... i have to do it... its power is over 9,000!!!!! lol
oops wrong chat ._.
my hamachi one ._.
Mass Effect?
not even close bob XD
/me adds another to the list
dat stability
that spaceship is wobbly
haha cus, power level..... over 9,000. ha hur lol
lets go pay luna a visit
This is not my day .__.
did anyone get my referencezz/
all of them creeperhugger10
reference?*
yep
goodnight again, everybody.
oh mibbit u so helpful
its just that its overused

what's the name of this song?
dis damn buffer
Good morning everypony.
:P6_9
this sounds like Miracle of Sound...
arabic song of wonder i think
good morning Emil
mornin?
thanks
Well, mid-day, I guess.
omg its 5:30 @_@......... ._. .... who gives a damn : D
00,02oh poo
I'm a late sleeper.
what time is it where u oive
00,02i took off the wrong way
00,02gona have to turn around
again?
No, not this game again...
OH YOU DONE GOOFED UP
didnt you do that earlier
go for jupiter Phase4!
5:32
they update this game emil
and phase made a speech when he landed on the mun @_@
Phase4: Did you remeber to put some kind of calming drug in the breathing oxygen this time?
emil, will you be my friend?
bob: A speech? : O
yes a kerbal speech o.o
lol
Epic win.
00,02Emil, not sure
00,02must have forgotten
Phase4: It is recommended to do that.
Last time I saw you play this you had only put drugs in 1 guys oxygen.
why wont anyone post this on media fire @_@
He was looking all happy while his friends were panicking.
bob: the game?
yes the game
Emil: middle Kerbal is very positive :D
the demo is on their website
middle kerbal is tom hanks
MadSurge: He always is?
the right one is smiling :D
i have the demo
oh
derp
Emil: as long as I remember, yes :D
Wow.
00,02i've like perfectly matched its orbit
wow
This game seems to complicated for my 13 year old brain.
thats the most awsome orbit ive ever seen
He's orbiting the moon now, right?
yes hes chasing it
Emil: you could go and make uncontrollable abominations that explode after two seconds :D
MadSurge: I guess.
The Mun, and no he's chasing Minmus
Nice orbit.
00,02these nice orbits are making me look like a much better pilot than i am
lol
Is it alright to laugh if you crash and burn?
; )
Hi everypony :)
00,02eventualy one will catch up to the other
yes Phase4 ppl are going to want you in nasa
OtakuTom: Hello!
Wait, what IS that?
shame NASA is shut down now...
this fandom and its massive age span o,o
they are?
They are?
are they?
00,02any minute now
...
ths goverment does notnwant us to advance to the beyond
NASA no longer sends manned space flights... but i think they also limit other flights to only the ISS
._.
lame
Whaaaat?
Why?
yeah... it happened like, last year...
No budget?
pretty much
they said that they would no longer send out space shuttles, but i doubt it
:/
Phase4: just gonna tell ya now if ya land on minmus successfully I'll have another grouping of links completely different then what i've shown ya before :)
00,02Perfect
too expensive to keep sending people into space
00,02i think
00,02Spectrum_Rush|, : D
they are doing it secretly @_@
DUM DUM DUUUM
and also... NASA is sometimes called Need Another Seven Astronauts for the times they had... accidents...
I have also read a horror story based on the moon.
yea
00,02lol
00,02allmost vertical fall
THIS DAM BUFFER @_@
Dat desktop pony...
Wait, where is he trying to land?
What planet/moon?
minmus i think
Minmus
What's that?
Where is it located?
Beyond the mun
Kerban's second Moon
^That
Far away?
/me crosses hooves
00,02dats a real nice orbit
00,02and i have a LOT of fuel left
please make it please make it
Phase4: Before you land, make sure it's NOT a gas planet!
Hmm...I need something to eat...
Emil: its not
Right.
We must deliver more pizza to Luna! :D
That's what they all said...
theres gas planets in this game?
welcome to da moon
00,02its not a gas planet
MadSurge: Luna is on Mun, somepony else is on Minmus
Brb.
Spectrum_Rush|: who? XD
prepare for extermination
There's a bird on our house.
MadSurge: and you'll see if phase make it
Brb.
yay no more buffer
its fine now
appropriate lyrics
What music is this?
derp ._.
wow
00,02this will take ages
00,02spelt better of course
cue the elevator music
00,02miracle?
yes that is correct Phase :P
I though birds could see windows.
Appearantly, they can't.
YAY
thats water man @_@
its it @_@
water?!
looks like water @_@
its more like ice
/me likes this song
Just because it's liquid doesn't mean it's water...
stop makeing us paranoid bob
damn these textures @_@
It could be liquid mercury.
ice planet
^
It's ice deal with it :O
it wasn't liquid in the last version.
/)_(\
Evolution, my friend.
ITS ICE CREAM @_@
>_>
MOTHER OF CELESTIA, YOU'RE RIGHT!
<_<
An ICECREAM PLANET!
:O
i wish i knew the name of this song :P
00,02i cant make the engines any slower than enough to take off
then we know which pony is there.
...
Who?
Clearly it's where Luna banishes Celestia to.
An icecream planet?
Luna's dark, not evil.
^
shes just luna
Right.
she can do what she wants : P
She doesn't have as much experience with banning people, right?
*banishing
@_@
You can do it!
Phase4: http://derpy.me/elibl http://derpy.me/S4yjP http://derpy.me/KkcMM http://derpy.me/mnWyj http://derpy.me/pFh4J http://derpy.me/3AlG8 http://derpy.me/zwAwz
LANDING!
Sweet!
as promised Phase4 :)
Yeah!
NOW EXPLODE!
cue another speech Phase4
yes!
lol
Dat design.
Awesome music climax.
00,02bob, i dont have another speach
:/
use anything
All dem Chrysalis :D
from mlp or somthing
...
And bedroom eyes
hahahaha
:O
00,02hmmm
Dat face.
MadSurge: told ya
of all ponies, why does Chrysalis remind me most of my exes?
LOL
Phase4: this time, its ice. Nuff said :D
Good morning everybrony :)
Good morning!
MaxTheSwedishBrony: Mornin
morining MaxTheSwedishBrony
when she appears she is much more dark then she really is
Spectrum_Rush|: I wonder if they'll make a Desktop Pony version of Chrysalis and Discord
Dat steam sounds.
*sound
Phase4: Well guys we made it to the moon! Now what?.......*turns on My little pony*
MadSurge: Totally agree on this
MaxTheSwedishBrony: What's the clokc at you?
MadSurge: we can only wait, or do it our selfs :D
take off the helmet....
Liokin: Hiya man /)
12 am
Or Pm
Same here.
Spectrum_Rush|: aye :D
GASP, you can control Kerbals?????
Just checking.
:)
Phase4: so are we here to collect Rarity? because this planet looks like a Marshmellow menace :P
KERBAAAAAL
killerpony7733: Sup bro /)
JETPACK!
00,02wonder if this kerbal could make it to orbit
Phase4: xD
haha
Liokin: Had a good day?
i suspect derpy is here -.-
Phase4: You evil, evil, person.
Take off the helmet!
:D
lol
killerpony7733: Meh.
Emil: Just see sumica he kills kerbals left and right at a whimm
killerpony7733: Oh.
Phase4: since it seems theres no fuel for kerbal jet packets you could probably make it bak to Kerban
00,02Spectrum_Rush|, no, theres fuel
oh
but it would take a year
Liokin: Aw well atleast ya got friends on bronystate :)
00,02but that would be awesome
00,02to go back to kerbin on nothing but jetpack fuel
and then SPLAT
Like a BAWS!
killerpony7733: True dat.
00,02i'ma go into minmus orbit then i have idea
Phase4: Put the astronauts on a MLP marathon, untill they die of loss of oxygen.
00,02XD
00,02i love the 115 day mission time
00,02because i was lazy with minmus intercept
They get to die happy, atleast.
i find the lack of crashing disturbing...
minmus intercept it's easier to apo out to Minmus altitude, then adjust eccentricity, then orbit facing 270 until Minmus speed is matched - puts you on collission course.
What kind of takeoff is that?
What is this game?
Kerbal Space Program.
00,02i wonder if i could....
ah
Imagine being in orbit over your target planet/moon, and accidently misclicking, launching all your takeoff fuel off into space.
And then being like: "........"
"Well... Shit."
00,02so i could get home super easy
hi :/
00,02ohai CCCP

the fuck is this
lets go for 4 perfect landings and orbits in a row!
next planet?
did he get to all the planets
mighta
yeah thats all there is in the game, just the planet, 2 moons... and the sun but you can't land on it
GO FOR THE SUN @_@
What so this game only have one planet and two moons?
not that Sumica didnt try cher3ry
Oh, I tried it too
than make it back to earth safely
I mean, it's the sun, how could you not wanna go there?
Kerban, not Earth
and you will have a 100% perfect trip!!! i suck at this game!!!!
i see scp173 in the gas room thing
and now i dont wanna go in
;_;
:p
can you put Satellites in space
?
yes you can
and, dat landing zone... nice
Did you guys see the japanese rocket yesterday?
although drag will probably pull you back to land.
coming in hot
thats bbetter
00,02ok, not that precice
00,02but
00,02thats where i took off
bufffer
00,02from over there
still practically walking distance. Or swimming. Not sure yet, looks like water
i am the new creeperhugger10!!!
00,02nere where the pink is
chnged my name
lol phase4fanboy
00,02ok
:P
00,02aparently the sas module cant handle parachute
00,02now we know
now we know : D
Oh my
00,02but other than that
did you die?
00,02i call it a success
but on the positive side, your SAS module is safe!
00,02MaxTheBrony, i did a bit
00,02cher3ry, nope
:) :D
00,02parachute detatched from it too
aww.
what a waste.
that was perfect space adventure
00,02oh
00,02nvm
/me plays taps for the poor SAS module
00,02id didnt
00,02sas module is safe
yay!
Well the pod will probably sink pretty fast so yeah there goners -lol
YAY PHASE4 !!!!!!
Noes D:
00,02but other than that minor malfunction
00,02i made it to minmus
00,02landed
the sas module knocked him off and stole the parachute
00,02then to the mun
00,02landed
00,02then to kerbit
00,02kerbin';
no, the pod smashed down at a speed too high - hitting water and hitting rock are the same effective thing, at a sufficiently high speed.
00,02:D
discintegrated on impact
/me 00,02feels baws
if only he had kerbin flags
phase4 is baws!!!!!
you know those are probably coming as mods now that you have EVA. That, and a variety of kerbonaut chutes and gliders.
any thing new for planes?
It's not that I was too scared to continue in SCP. I just didn't know what to do...
00,02one small step for Phase4
00,02one giant leap for kerbal kind
im back to normal
anything new for planes @_@
God you type fast Phase4
!!!!!! YAY!!!!!!!
Phew
00,02the next chalenge will be when they make another planet
one giant leap into a backplant Phase4
thats a big rocket
Time to sleep, Goodnight/day everyone
00,02not sure how to fix sas problem
is it really 6:37, wow
00,02i kinda need it for landing
nite TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Dunno that you can... that module's big and the SAS module is tiny...
can you mount the chutes to the side of the capsule instead?
ok, so phase 4 is brodcsting from east coast usa!!!!
yay
:O did you build the rocket yourself O.o i didnt know that!
00,02cher3ry, i could
00,02MaxTheBrony, i built the rocket myself
Amazing :O
i would like to walk around this rocket
see how big it is
only other solution that comes to mind is lots of duct tape
what othe video games do youmplay phase4?
00,02creeperhugger10, a few others
creeperhugger10: like the new Deus Ex
or borrow from the wide lander, and put the SAS on the side pods.
ahh, i see. phase, think you should scrap the hole think and try it with a tiny crappy ship!
phase4
00,02creeperhugger10
:O they animated tiny kerbals in the hangar!!!
although your side pods are for thrust rather than landing stability in this design, that shouldn't make a difference as far as SAS goes, as long as they're still attached at landing time
how boat that, try it with the crappiest ship and see how you do
creeperhugger10: that's Sumica's job :D
:D
^Pretty much
R rated streaming for the win!
Sumica: 's designs arent crappy :D theyre just not pretty
^And they kill kerbals easily
^
:3 my pic
YAAAAAAY LUNA!!!!!!
MALESTIA AND THE MALEST FEST!!!!!

Nope.
It's simple.
Not stupid.
That game is fun.

Applejacks damage is awesome.
Everything dies.
EAT SHIT AND DIE

Wow.
Yeah
And some guys were like, GUN LAWS WON'T STOP NUTHING
creeperhugger10: Do you have proof?
scroll up chat :)
Pwnies: Depends.
Don't see what you mean.
Unfortunately, I can't scroll that far, since I recently crashed.
So I'm not gonna say anything about that.
70% of the chat in the past 8 minutes is you
IT'S LOOTING TIME
70% of chat in the last minutes is you
I am not spamming. I am talking a lot.
GOD DAMMIT WHO IS STREAMING

It's good for you!
Chocobunny: sometimes life is more important than a simple movie.
AdamTheDuck: Being on a boat for 7 hours is not very important.
NOO LIAM NEESON
DON'T LEAVE DAD
maby you could jury rigg a computer and internet connection

WindWhistler if it didn't involve shemale ponies we don't want to know ^_^
g'day Thrackerzod
And the new mane six were just filly versions...
Cypresswolf: where are you finding things like the derpy hooves toy and the box of cards for 50$ with free shipping?
Oh, and a filly alicorn.
I didn't get it either.
d3rb: Yep :D
For some reason, I had something against the filly alicorn.
She just bugged me.
ingwaz: Amazon - took me 4 days to find - 9 left last I checked - price has risen $5 since yesterday though
Luckily it was just a dream.
ahh Thrackerzod, nice to have a normal pony around
Why is that windwhistler
Thrackerzod: I have no idea. I barely remember much about the dream.
so many derpys on ebay, so annoying
ingwaz, i am i regualr magical unicorn
d3rb: How much are they going for?"
lol, just got your name Thrackerzod
Thrackerzod: but of course, of course
WindWhistler: Wow that's a very intresting dream. I never have dreams anymore :(
Toywizard is still sold out, ebay had some but dealer sold out while waiting for word dealer still had some
bis starting at $50 buy it now about $250
bids**
Ponies47: on the bright side you dont get nightmares either
I traveld here beteewn the crzcks in the wall, where only dreams my ly.
.............
cracks*
twily_sprinkle_GS17: True. But it has been to long since I have a had a dream
Ponies47: also i remember from biology that a healthy sleep doesnt involve dreams
/me is bugged by Thrackerzod's spelling.
twily_sprinkle_GS17: That is not true. Dreaming is where your body goes to work.
brb
Windwhistler can get over it because i have a shit keyboard
WindWhistler: exactly, it works instead of resting
ony one problem with custom maps
they take so long to download
Pffft. If only I had that paper I got from Health...
Well actually, I shouldn't be caring what you guys think about it.
05im halfway now
I've got some MST3K to watch
05need 10 more
Oh! Wrek! Perfect timing!
I'm thinking about getting a HP TouchSmart TM2...
Is it a good choice?
Back with breakfest
As far as tablets go
05im a bit sceptical against HP
WindWhistler get an asus tf201
i always dream of catching the pony rerun stream from the hub at this hour 0,0y-~~
/me looks at her computer and sees that it's an HP.
Dat Twi <3
Windwhistler i did the same thing
/me looks at his and sees its custom<3
a twi on stream??GTFO ad!!
Lucky you Wrek.
05but yeah guise, what to do?
lol, i have an HP worstation too, but it's only half HP nowadays
custom <3
skyrim?
twily_sprinkle_GS17 i suggest adblock
drinking games, play an ep and shot everytime the word ponyt is said
Oh, Wrek, what's wrong with HP?
Wrek: I have no idea. Sorry :<
<3 custom machines
d3rb: In that case, he'll never get a shot.
*troll facE*
alexxm: yeah, i havent installed it on this pc. altho adblock can sometimes screw stuff up
WindWhistler, oh u
like what twily_sprinkle_GS17
05thats mine
Oh geez, that game was awesome. Ty, d3rb :D
oh wow
:o
no probs, how cool was fluttershy!
your is damn close to mine
But RaveBrony, ponyt is never said in MLP.
alexxm: well on some live streams they dont start until you wait 30 secs and close the adblock. if you have adblock then it glitches the ad and theres just an outer line of where the ad wouldve been and you cant start up the stream
05just imagine pony and razer stickers on it
*close the ad
Nice :D
lol, i slap sticksers all over my cases too
Anyways, back to MST3K
holy crap my typing sucks this morning
lol im reading roissy's blog and he mentions bronies,buck yeah! /)

Ah, they're coming by too quickly. D:

d3rb The shooting isn't as scary as the reaction some religious politicians are having. O_o
brb

Holy crap this is insane.
d3rb I'm glad I live in Scotland. Though I would prefer to live in an area of it thats very remote.
Hehe skyrim
Wow. Thats a lot of downloaded mods
I think you need more.
Dem mods
05i think ima gona do a swordwielder this time
DARN YOU WREK, I'M TRYING TO WATCH MST3K, AND YOU PUT ON SKYRIM?!
/me Has never played Skyrim :$

Ponies47, its pretty good
Wrek Personally I prefer maces and axes, though it's annoying the don't have anywhere near as many finishing animations as the swords. >_<
d3rb: I know, but I want to watch him play! ;-;
WindWhistler As do I.
But I'm watching MST3K
And Skyrim crashed :P
that was quick
Wrek's icon is scary....:o
WindWhistler Why?
It looks freaky.
i am failing so hard at this.
OMG IM THE 999,999 VISITOR I COULD HAVE SWORN I WAS THAT YESTERDAY!
WindWhistler I don't see it....

I found a picture of Twilight that is so bucking cute :3
WindWhistler: That smile...

Hello everypony.

00,10ohhi FairysHuff
hey Emil how've you been
00,10yeah geting alot of buffering here as well
alexxm: Good, and you?
00,02Sumica, minmus landing, then takeoff, then land on mun, then takeoff, then fail misserably in kerbin atmosphere

i'm good Emil
Nice.
I am terrible bored.
00,02turns out sas modules dont like being yanked by the new parachutes
d3rb: bugger. need someone to play the zombies with.
Sumica wonder whats causing all the buffering....
hey phase
Laws of physics, you know?
00,10did you use the one man pod?
Wrek word of advice. shileds are your freinds
00,02Sumica, nope, 3 man
00,10what chute did you use for it? the new one?
*shields
00,02i would offer to send you the .craft file but my mouse is still moving itself
00,02used the new chute
00,10did you see the part where it's twise the size with half the impact tolerence?
00,02i was going at like 800 meters/s when it deployed, i imagine that was the issue
00,02Sumica, wait, what? the chute?
00,10aye
00,02i'll pretend that makes sense
00,10it's breaks easyer then old chute
i remeber i rented skyrim at a library i had to play console but it was still fun me and my friend picked the elf and named mr.T
not elf orc i meant
00,02my problem was the sas module wich detatched from the pod
00,10Wrek go for sword kitty
Lol
I want an orc bride in skyrim. don't think there are any though.
phase 4 is awesome :)
whoever is streaming why can we hear you click?
Phase4: Are you...are you black?
Somepony is playing Skyrim on stream?
00,02Liokin, odd question
getting sleepy, time for a can of liquid energy
00,02i'm caucasian
is it laggy for anyone else
Phase4: The avatar on the stream...
Person playing should make their character a Pony.
Liokin why would you ask that
00,02oh, my oc
alexxm, yep
00,02oc is blue with yellow hair
Phase4: No the red guard lloking guy
Liokin it`s pretty laggy for me too
I've been looking at functional weapon axes online and maces but yu can never know if they are a scam or not
00,02no, i'm not that guy
alexxm: Cause of the red guard on the stream.
FairysHuff, what type of axe?
Egyptian war axes are extremely easy to make.
00,10cause Liokin wants to draw Phase4 doing something naughty
00,02Sumica, fixed my mouse, windows bug
Phase4: Yeah I know that -lol but often people base there characters off of there own physical appearence.
Sumica: Why do you have to be black to do something naughty! >:3
00,02oh, i'm not streaming
PEOPLE I HAVE A SECRET TO REVEAL
/me is planning on making a comic.
00,02Wrek's streaming i thin
morning, everypony :)
00,02think;
dukedontnukem: Is it that you talk in caps?
Unnr|Work a one handed double headed axe is what i would like. for display and functional combat.
00,02morning Sylandest
howdy, Phase4! :)
First thing to do once you get free? Become a vampire.
00,10no Liokin, but I have seen your DA =p
00,02Sumica, i'll send you the craft file
g'day Sylandest
00,10cool

Vampires suck
Sumica: *shrug* what can I say. *picks up play brony magazine*
00,10it's upsidedown
WindWhistler become a vampire werewolf
WindWhistler, i see what you did there
Barbetos|Atwork: I'd rather be a werewolf. No daylight side-effects.
05hint: Winter is coming
05can you see the resemblence?
my computer is broken so im on a different one!
Daylight side effects ain't so bad.
tuesday is coming, did you bring your coat?
Well yeah, if you want everyone to know you're a vampire.
well bye everypony i have to do other things
goodbye dukedontnukem
The best part about being a vampire is having a whole town chasing you down on the 5th day without feeding thoguh XD
I failed so many quests that way.
Wrek: Its a nice day for a *** Wedding [must have spoiler goggles installed to view *** content]

For example, I blew out the candles on someone else's cake because they were struggling.
Everyone laughed at me. I hid under the table. They all looked under just to laugh at me.

And I saw the most HORRIFYING thing ever.
Sumica Seems rather unbalanced
3-D ultra pinball thrillride has to be my favorite PC game of all time
http://derpy.me/UESQW

AN ANIME
WindWhistler: dafaq i just read
FOR THE PEANUTS
meh, could be worse....probably
.......WORSE....if thats possible
WindWhistler oh dear
I'm so scared...
00,10Bronysith I would call it 2fort in a nutshell
Sumica: ahh
You know what the average anime consists of!
Swearing, blood, sexual jokes...
Sumica Yeh, I am looking forward to seeing all the pony mods. If he has any installed.
Even ONE of those in the Peanuts...
Japan is going to rape my childhood.
00,10i doubt he dose
only if you watch it WindWhistler
theres a lot of good anime..
not the anime i watch, but then again its not average sooooWHYARETHEYMAKIGAPENUTZANIME
Sumica poop ~_~
00,10unless that play as Twi mod is done
twily_sprinkle_GS17: You don't understand. The Peanuts CAN'T be made into an anime.
im going to do an internet
MORROWIND goty is now 5$
WOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Peanuts and anime don't mix!
WindWhistler: what peanuts? i just got here after a violent crash of google chrome
Are there pony mods for Morrowind?
twily_sprinkle_GS17: You know, the comic strip.
I just can't bear the thought of it...
WindWhistler: eh ive never heard of it. nvm then
............
You've NEVER heard of the Peanuts comics?
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Where have you BEEN?!
WindWhistler: in another country most likely.
Good, Wrek is using a shield. Shields are your friends in this game ^_^
00,10this light mod kinda sucks for visabilty but is great for realisim
Peanuts has been printed in newspapers all over the world.
Well anyways.
WindWhistler: doubtful, and my country sucks
anyone want to sing "still alive" with me?
WindWhistler I've never heard of it either.
i think im going to be sick...
I grew up with the Peanuts...I'm VERY passionate about it...
anyway i though wrek was way past this part?
twily_sprinkle_GS17: where do you live anyway?
twily_sprinkle_GS17: New game.
me neither WindWhistler
You know, Charlie Brown, Snoopy, those guys?
WindWhistler: cant imagine myself ever restarting this game, too tedious
this was a triumph
00,10and then sencing he was in danger the dovakin sated his hunger in the midle of battle by eating 8 wheels of cheese
Sumica Then had a coronary heart attack immediately after.
im making a note here HUGE SUCCESS
Sumica: the dovakin's true power is speed eating
twily_sprinkle_GS17: okay :)
Unnr|Work: thats not how you spell fail at life
Sumica: You just made my morning :D
CCCP: it sucks <.<
its hard to overstate my satisfaction
yay spiders
aperture science
we do what we must, because, we can
twily_sprinkle_GS17 why does it suck?
CCCP: corrupt to the core
for the good of all of us (except the ones who are dead)
twily_sprinkle_GS17: hmm, that sucks :C
00,10wish I could take credit Dr_Fumbles but I was quoting a comic
http://cheezburger.com/6437458688
oh hey, it's that first cave :3
to all fans of ff6 http://cheezburger.com/6437570560
i cant remeber this next group of lyrics....
00,10a flashback bit wher one of the guards tells of how his father used to tell him stories of the dragon born.
http://www.knivesbynick.co.uk/weapons_axes.htm
so I asume this is Phase4?
Oh... still fricken hilarious, where can I find it?
CCCP: u live in usa rite?

Sumica: is that meanwhile as an imperial guard?
00,10could be Bronysith

hi BaconMane
Man, I wish I could play this on PC, I just have xbox...
00,10know what goes great with cheese?
Dr_Fumbles: why? get new vegas instead
00,10Bacon
Sumica: you know what would suck...
for some reason when i tried to type in "bronystate" i accidentaly typed in "bronysith" and found his DA page 0_o
All I need to buy is a one handed battle axe or mace and a suitable shield and I shall be good to go..... slaughter all the bucking NEDs in my area >_< *Hates NEDs*
Bronysith: Sounds good, will do
Dr_Fumbles: no seriously. new vegas is a fantastic game
apprently one of skyrims updates inculdes a suplex as a finisher
0,5I know right?
Sumica: being blind
0,5I had bacon bits yesterday
Sumica: you know what would suck even more
0,5Turns out it isn't real bacon >:
BaconMane: The baccon was a lie...
Sumica: being blind and crippled
I absolutely LOVED Fallout 3, so I'm sure I'll like it.
fake bacon? this is herecy!
indeed ಠ_ರೃ
0,5ITS BLASPHEMY
Bronysith Penis?
0,5It's Fake-con )
00,10You are right that would suck
Sumica: being blind and crippled because your mom got shot
should make your own bacon bits
indeed ಠ_ರೃ
Rather.
Probably not a good time to admit that I actively saught to remove my own eyes a few weeks ago then.
soldiers: "captian weve used up all our arrows, all our weapons are broken and we threw them all at the dragon. WHAT DO WE DO NOW!? captian: "THROW UR HELMET!!!!"
I want bacon now
hi BM
And no. I'm not joking
indeed ಠ_ರೃ
FairysHuff: why?
oh.....

00,10Still find it funny that one time I had some witch woman attack me in this game so I killed her and looted her house.
Quick_Thinker: The problem is whatever pony you have as pinkie pie will have to go through alot of food from all the jumpping
how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
guys we survived 4chan we are not going any where anytime soon
00,10the next day after she was dead she sent hit men after me for stealing her shit

robotdragon8 The resistence games are some of my favourites.
Ok, so I got called by a 555 number just now.
FairysHuff: you mean half life?
http://derpy.me/nC4Nd
FairysHuff: lol
FairysHuff: my favorite shooters along with area 51 and half life
Maybe I should have answered. It could have been Derpy.
who's streaming?
http://derpy.me/ZxjDs
Bronysith No. Resistence for PS3. World war two style era where alien life begin taking over the world.
so is anyone streaming?
http://derpy.me/ypzHl
pony44728: yeah, wrek is
FairysHuff: the game feels a little like half life to me. still pretty good game though.
FairysHuff: i like how they use med kits
so does any pony want to do a Minecraft lets play of say... vechs super hostile and we all try to get the cloths
all the while one of has a different personality of the mane 6
Bronysith Can't say it felt anything like half life to me but yes I'm glad they brought back med packs.
SKYRIM! HELL YEAH!! mah favroite game!
Flyboy: ...
Bronysith: oh give it a rest will ya, others can like it.
bronysith: what? bad time?
Bronysith is just opinion
i like this game 2
twily_sprinkle_GS17: yup
still doesnt mean i cant rant
http://derpy.me/Hsj09
its a good game, well made and much effort into it
ahahhahahaha
thats a good one
/me hands Bronysith a particularly rickitty soap box
http://derpy.me/losYR
so no mane 6 lets play then of Minecraft..... damn
Oh please don't start with this again. ~_~ Lets just enjoy the stream.
Bronysith: dont make me smack you.
CCCP: das so cuute

CCCP: the one with Lauren was also in a code geass pmv
Wrek how can you see what you're doing
whos streaming then. wrek again?
Bronysith: as much as i like the game i think for ur safety u run before u get smacked....
Spectrum_Rush|Dov I can't see shit
twily_sprinkle_GS17: oh cool
skyrim is well made, it runs good on my crappy computer and it takes up less than 6 gb, which is awesome
http://derpy.me/hE0wz
seriously no one wants to do a Minecraft lets play on PC with the personality of the mane 6
Quick_Thinker: maybe later, idk. that takes some mental preparation
point taken
http://derpy.me/fsN-F
RP is exhausting for me
not a threat from me Bronysith, just leeroy jenkins urself out of it in case it happens...
i never RP'ed in my life actually
robotdragon8: what?
only as a troll :3
im gonna be Twilight and i think im going to try my damndest to have a mental breakdown
Quick_Thinker: I would but when ever i try to buy minecraft the transaction never goes through.
^ huh sucks
twily_sprinkle_GS17: you havent? trust me its fun!
Bronysith RUN AND FIGHT
http://derpy.me/6b1Ro
Flyboy: but it takes...effort, bleh

Bronysith: i can understand that people may not like it, but i just dont think its a bad game
Heya again :D!
http://derpy.me/bDkm8
twily_sprinkle_GS17: i mean. just because it is overated doesnt make it a bad game
Nittany_Discord: ohai!!!!!
0,5But that means when they get punished, they have no excuses ^_^
11,01Hi.

http://derpy.me/7BjLZ
CCCP: my sarcasm detector is broken i hope thats what you were going for :[
24 damage sword at 3rd level????? he must be playing novice
Spectrum_Rush|Dov: well... I like Luna i really do, but i think she is a tab bit overrated
im at level 16 and i still have 24 damage swordcs
"Loading downloadable content. Please wait" -_-
CCCP: :'(
Spectrum_Rush|Dov: :( awww sorry i still like Luna!
CCCP: people just feel like the show needs more eps with her because shes an interesting character
Ooooh, Skywim :3
twily_sprinkle_GS17 i know, and i agree that she does
so what quest is this
god my kingdom for ebony ore right now
CCCP: yeah,shes actually a somewhat relatively complex character
does anyone else hate regenerating health?
man the items he gets. maybe i should play at novice
Bronysith: only on enemies
Spectrum_Rush|Dov: ...
well i hate both ways
Huh. I did not know you could do that with torches.
i almost went to the womens restroom, luckily no one saw me run out to the men's *phew*
Bronysith: if you really want to play hardcore i recommend you set skyrim on the hardest 5th difficulty, i cant imagine it being easy after that
11,01Regenerating health doesn't bother me.
Bronysith: unless i'm in the mood for challenge then no regen on me is fine
Spectrum_Rush|Dov: i like health pack systems
ouch
xD
*no one saw me run out of the womens restroom and quickly go into the men's
Spectrum_Rush|Dov: regen heatlht reminds me of call of duty
weird, he died so fast for that level
i'm not really bothered by regeneting health
nobody is :3
Wow. Strong undead guy
Bronysith just likes hardcore gaming
Bronysith: i prefer a game with no health, one hit you ded :3
11,01robotdragon8: Is really a girl *Giggles*
resistance is like a hybrid of health pack and regenerate
Spectrum_Rush|Dov: like contra?
SILENCE

^_^ I has enough money left over in my pony budget to see a movie this week
I only play Master

Cypresswolf: which movie?

CCCP: i kno dat feel
11,01Thank Sumica for being Sumica?
FFFFUCKK
the first time i played this game i blasted the draugr with fire to finish it off...it was EPIC
The B movie choice of awesome doom, Sumica
oh! did he sart a new game!" that explains why his choice of weapon is so... limeted
so many typos 0.o
seems there's also an exclusive documentary playing at my cinema this weekend - why does Katy Perry sound familiar?
some one got in my way in a hallway, i shouted them away and said "move means MOVE!"
Flyboy: he gets 43 damage weps at level 3 and im at level 16 and i get 24 damage weps. could that be cause of difficulty?
/me 11,01dusts Flyboy's spelling with his feather duster 2001
Nittany_Discord: why thank you good sir
so does anypony actually want to do the whole RP the mane 6 in Minecraft lets play of Super hostile Maps
Quick_Thinker: i will! if you got a server
Quick_thinker: i would if i had it ._.
who are you gonna RP?
im already being Twi
shit...
so that leaves 5
00,10what is with the blur effect?
^
00,10wrek are you on the drugs
might as well be AJ then
Blur adds more woosh
in a bad way
05i drank booze
gotta go fast
-_- ah, she's the one who made California Gurls - no going within 50ft of that theatre
gotta go fast
thats some potent stuff
Nord Mead?
00,10must be the good shit to give speed blur
just saying if you wish to RP your gonna need a decent mic for skype and i also need someone to record and maybe even upload it to youtube
Wrek: how was it?
my character doesnt like mead, he drinks WINE
Quick_Thinker: ah crap, my last mic broke :(
it was laced...
could i just speak through the game chat?
:) Double Feature! Ice Age & Batman
odd mix
Cypresswolf: the 4th ice age?
yep
i still cant believe there are 4 ice ages
ice age 5 HUMANITY
twily_sprinkle_GS17, it's Dreamworks
Pixar ftw
if it works, milk it
I still haven't seen IA3
CrimsonPhoenix: thats why i dont like dreamworks
through the game chat? hmmmmm well not really im using a mic to add some emotion to the words like i already have one thing set up and that is twi going batshit insane at one part
me neither Cypresswolf
I agree with you twily_sprinkle_GS17
I mean their animation is great and the jokes are ok I guess
but there's no story in their movies
^
^_^ Hobbit is 5 months away
Pixar makes the best stories
that's why Pixar is superior
and so much feels
Quick_Thinker: : wait, whats your skype name?
aw poor wabbit
We've made it past the half way mark, ponies ^_^
i wish someone would play "strength of a thousand men" by two steps from hell when they fight a dragon
but they can also tell a good story with all of that
my skype name is Quick Thinker
Quick_Thinker: oh right :D
i need a smelter

snowy areas at night in skyrim make me sad cause its so depressing.

I bought the Alan Wake collection in the steam sale!
awesome Dermathil
sounds liek a fun game
I'm in love with that series
thanks to the best LPer ever doing a let's play of it
Hannah?
(he plays smart)
no
Galm
He's so funny yet he voices his thought pattern when he's puzzling
I've watched a few LP of it, seems like good storytelling
GREAT storytelling
ah Q is back to being an original name i can kinda of rest peacefully
hell that guy did a LP of Civ 5
hey Dermathil how've you been
I'm great
about to leave for a big family reunion.
At the family lakeside terrain
(the extended family on my dad's side owns a whole peninsula of land at a small lake
Large family reunion? That's something I'll never experience
I have no clue what my roots are
my dad's got 9 sisters and 2 brothers
oh wow
Add to that the cousins and the family that comes from my grandmother's siblings and we are usually 30+
after the big family supper
I remember like 10 years ago, was in a confirmation for some cousin or something. My exact thoughts: "Who the hell are all these people?"
sounds like a pinkie swell party
(there are smaller reunions every month to celebrate the birthdays of that month)
sounds swell
indeed it is
Back in June was the lobster party
you have a lobster party?
(June birthdays and lobster)
Ohh man

hai Malavolent
Hey Malavolent
ello Malavolent
hm howard stern
Ohai Malavolent!
this is risky
08,01Chrysalis: i did
and already after the first 20 sec i have facepalmed to the luna
08,01Chrysalis: though it's mainly for the discussion of sex and sexuality
08,01which sounds like a racier version of a Jane Austin novel
uhhhhhh i feel more creeped out by these guys talking about ponys being sexual more then clop fics and other things
08,01MadSurge: of course
Shame I can't stay at the peninsula for longer than the party
Otherwise I'd go hiking up the ski resort (that's closed in summer because NO SNOW)
08,01Quick_Thinker: we don't tend to talk about that
08,01we talk about real things; albiet real things that would get one banned in here
Quick_Thinkerme too, I can understand Clupfics or Pictures that are done for the Lulz, but people that generally think that these are sexy are creepy :/
08,01read some heinlein
We tend to say "X is best pony", but that's about it :D
LOL In my twitter feed: "I only bring up Slender 'cos people keep mailing me about it. Slenderman is filed alongside MLP under 'things the Internet is weird about' "
Q is best pony
That's Yahtzee saying that
08,01slendermane
Slendermare
Slender's an indie game
I liek Donimusic.. just named his newest Remix "One More Time (Doni's Dubstep/Electro Remix - God Particle Edition)" and has nothing to do with Higgs Bosons
you gotta get 8 pages before you get caught by Slender
Saw someone posting this with the title: "How I play Slender" http://i.imgur.com/haexG.jpg
What is Slender?
an indie game
A creepy game
don't look behind you
I saw JessieCox play it on a video
All I know of it..
you gotta get 8 pages
i play slender while listen to giggle at the ghosties XD
I actually saw a Slenderman Pony some month ago, it looked cool
before you get caught
Dermathil: And let me guess jump scares
Quick_Thinker: don't. The warning cues are audio.
and when i see him i laugh
you'll only drown out the only warning that are telling you you're about to die
Maybe Slender just wants friends
eh like i care its all for fun
the papers say otherwise
i would go up to him and give a nice big hug if he didnt instakill me as soon as i tried
Well I don't intend to play it
Slender is just misunderstood
well given that everyone who meets the slender man goes insane or ends up dead i don't think so
what did I wanted to do again :/ I forgot?
Where the hell did the whole Slender myth originate from?
Lil_B: Eat?
SpadeMagnes[R], It was a photoshop contest.
Malavolent no, I was searching something, but eating would be a good Idea
trolljhg
Lil_B: I know, right?
Malavolent I'm afk getting somer bread XD
Yay.
O_O Guys ArmA 2 is 40% off on the daily deal
Is it sad I consider all of you my only friends? Aside from my WoW guildies
Someone on Something Aweful posted a contest, where you had to photoshop normal pictures to look supernatural and pose them on this supernatural webpage as true stories
Dermathil, Got it before the sales :P
Jim: kick yourself
I am
NEVER buy a game before it goes on the daily deal
http://youtu.be/6NXnxTNIWkc
SpadeMagnes[R]: Meet new people.
wait, I remembered, I want to search fo"First Samurai" on Youtube XD gotta do that before I forget it again
Malavolent: If I had a car or a life I would...
it's always good to know some roots I say
SpadeMagnes[R]: You were born with legs, use them, take a walk, visit places and stuff.
I'm really pale because I dont go outside, so my mom tells me
You need a tan then
SpadeMagnes[R], welcome to my world
Why should being pale stop you from meeting people?
i go outside sometimes and i look like i have a nice tan
same
keyword is sometimes
no one tans like gaston
No one gastons like gaston
no one also gets killed like Gaston
gastonception
One does not simply do X like Gaston
exactly
Gaston killed by whateve the beast name is
beast
Now that I think about it, my neighborhood barely has any kids.
dammit internet connection
Man I have been playing Kingdom Hearts Re: Coded for days....
vd
welp today I just got another conclusion
who's streaming?
CrimsonPhoenix: Of?
http://youtu.be/32FB-gYr49Y this version is 1000 times better than what the streamers use
but who's streaming?
huh noone?
Dermathil, seems like I wouldn't have anything to gain from the arma deal anyways http://i.imgur.com/MWL9g.jpg
I can not believe some one made another I wanna be the guy game..
The first one was sadistic enough
LOL
Jim, ARMA deal?
SpadeMagnes[R], there's like 5 games
if not more
they made another FUCK now i have to beat that one
He says so
hello everypony :) how is everyone doing ?
The one I just learned about is I wanna be the guy gaiden
40% off if I'm correct
hey sergio
Jim :O!
20% off actually
probely gonna go to 50 or 75 on the final day
I mean the even the game's map screen can kill you!
may i ask waht are you guys talking about ? :P
*what
SpadeMagnes[R]: yeah, those games aren't very fun :|
I still find it amazing some insane man managed to beat I wanna be the guy on impossible mode
SpadeMagnes[R]: There is an IWTBTG : TM : TG The Sequel?!?
When he found out the creator said and I quote "Holy crap you're not serious are you"
Unnr: fanmade.
MadSurge: Ooooh, that makes much, much more sense
I love how the impossible mode has a glitch that allows you to save
^
waht?
You mean that moving save point?
Yep
there is exactly one frame that before it tries to eat you, its a valid save point
Also how insane do you have to be to try that game with out dieing?
I got to dracula on Insane
Apples do not fall up
"They're more like giant cherries"
SpadeMagnes[R]: of course, that's why its delicious fruit
I doubt anyone could beat the game without dieing on their first try
Alot of the stuff that kills you comes out of fucking nowhere
did anyone ever finished i wanna be the guy in impossible without dieing ?
sergio_scriptor: yep
well spade if someone can beat throught the fire and flames on expert with no mess ups anything possible
Unnr: can you send me a link ?
hmm
sergio_scriptor: When the make found out he said "Holy crap you're not serious are you"
ah bullocks i left this on all night
SpadeMagnes[R]: my greatest respects for the guy or girl who did it
they are probely in a mental ward
:D
sergio_scriptor: It took the guy 6 days on nonstop trying
*of
so he never even sleept damn
No he said he took breaks
lali-ho bretherin and... sisterin
He did take breaks for sleeping and eating
SpadeMagnes[R]: well i guess you can say that we *puts on sunglasses* wasted a life.YEEEEEEEEAHHHH...sorry that was not my best one :$
*he
Said it cost him his sanity and probably his soul
hai ish, finished with that math thing?
Gah damn it, gotta avoid the Eliminator again...
ok now ARMA is 40% off
freaking heartless....
too bad i already bought it when it came out
Quick_Thinker: i think you mean "dayz" is 40 % off...
http://derpy.me/B0eo5
ahahhahahahaa
CrimsonPhoenix: The fuck?
i play ACE as well and some of the flashpoint maps
sergio_scriptor: ARMAII is a perfectly good game in its own right
SpadeMagnes[R], My planet needs me
Unnr|SlowReponseAhea: i know,i was just referencing the fact that almost 80% of the people who buy arma 2 only buy it to play dayz :P
and im so bucking hyped for ARMAIII
let's be honest if you had dayz has a stand-alone game,and someone went up to you and said: "i have arma 2 and dayz,you can choose one of them for free,which one do you choose? "which one would You truly choose ?
arma 2
Oh wow this pop up is bugging me
in every way do i love that game
it took me hours to learn how to fly a helo and afte that i was flying rainbow dash style
and i did it all on my own
but Arma 2 is optimized for crap
arma 2 is a unique game,truly one of the most realistic experiences,but if i had to choose between a realistic war simulator or a realistic zombie simulator,i would choose the zombie one...sorry :\
You know what isnt fun in a game? Doing a level with no weapons and said leve has a bunch of enemies and objects that damage you
SpadeMagnes[R]: so "afraid of monsters" in a nutshell ? :)
waht game may that be?
oh wait day z thnaks to the ppatchs
or better yet, leveling up a move by using it like 70 times
Kingdom Heart Re: Coded in the Hollow Bastion section
I dont have the keyblade, cant use spells, Cant even heal, and I have to rely on the AI of Goofy and Donald
sergio you actually want to play day z i stopped play for a long time after o found this site and i feel i need to go back to it
Quick_Thinker: i liked dayz more when you atleast with a makarov :'(
*started
SpadeMagnes[R] you're doomed
You can order then to either follow you atatck blox or heartless
The main issue is I cant use Curaga
good thing I avoided buying Quantum Conundrum before :) now is the time to strike
I have to either use potions or wait for health orbs
Quick_Thinker: to be honest i would like to try dayz,even just 1 time
Suddenly cone
Quick_Thinker: it looks fun...sometimes
Am i the only one who is seeing website is offline? D:
good god
Is it starting or am I hype for nothing
that surprised me there
you nearly gave me a heart attack
Someone's making a game inspired from Day Z
suddenly sound
STREAAAAAM
movie night?
They're calling it War Z
suddenly muscic
huh? what is going on?
Jim: cool :)
what's this instrumental?
i signed up for the beta for war z :D
me too
free game is a free game
this instrumental sounds awesome
still no email though
Quick_Thinker: wehre can i sign in ? :\
*where
Well, pay to buy, play for free
i have no clue
:D
You know what bothers me about day Z?
damn
People kill each other for no reason except to be dicks
i got a link from a friend and went to it
^
SpadeMagnes[R]: that's why dayz is only fun with friends
oh giggle at the ghosties metal sounds freaking epic
metal makes everything sound epic
War Z sounds interesting, because when you die you don't lose hour upon hour of progress
and thats why i made that day z MLP FIM crossover fic to show that even they will ahve a tough time being friends there
you are only locked out of the character for a set amount of time when you die
i was a player in the TF2 LIVESREAM!!!
kudos to you
Jim: is war z at least has realistic as dayz ? :\
hurray for you
00,10sounds like you lose pontintal progress then Jim
sergio_scriptor, I don't know, it's not released yet

Quick_Thinker: WHAT ? :|
Sumica, Why yes, but you could play on another character while it's locked
I am here, and what is this?
MLP PRO!!!!
SpadeMagnes[R] too many polygons on screen?
Also, you don't lose EVERYTHING like you do in Day Z

I want the power source of this ray
TAKE BOTH
the pinkie promise!!!
/me huggles luna
Wait, would it still have the same mass, though?
get the ticket
11,01Shrinking the moon wouldn't make it lighter.
And of course since it's a cartoon we don't think about the real problems in taking the moon away
But that moon won't fil his heart :'(
Nittany_Discord: maybe it decreases the density, although it doesnt look like it
Nittany_Discord: Wow, true o.o
Nittany_Discord: nope
The Density has been Doubled... and then some
kevin?
yay kevin's back
OH SHIT :O

Fuck Logic
KEVIN SENT ME
Shrink ray goes up, moon comes down, never a miscommunication - can't explain that.

hi and bye Shizu[HatesComcast] :)
Nittany_Discord: i meant maybe the ray throws away some molecules and makes it smaller that way, as wel as decreasing distance
11,01To make it smaller and lighter, you'd have to destroy some mass (convert it to energy).
GTA IV MAP
Hope it sorts out soon Shizu.

11,01And by basic physics laws, you're going to need a lot of force to move that heavy mass around.
OohShiny I uh, meant the technical babble
Imagine having the moon in your pocket.
Nittany_Discord: would't a black hole actually appear from the sudden lack of mass?
There aren't many times where you can order someone to bring the moon
