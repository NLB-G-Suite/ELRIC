Where are the mods when we need them
Hey where did sumica's pony go?
9/11 jokes make me explode with laughter
Poor taste is a matter of opinion
alright alright
I'm out of here... good night
um ok
Anne Franky, holocaust jokes are unfunny too.
Well how about too soon then
think about it like this: if you had a family member die in some incident, would you like for other people to joke about it?
*type
alright alright
...how'd the discussion get to this again?
Why are you being all like that dude?
than*
why not just not think about it?
13how about you don't
yup
00,10or just dont bring it up is a setting such as this.
I doubt the family of the victims would think the same
:(
00,10no one else was talking about it
It not like we're going to learn anything from the tragedy.
I dont even like talking about it
when you joke about something like that, you are still reminding people of it
but there's a time frame needed before it can be made fun of
well to be honest, someone did bring up the shootings
IT's just me and my obscure sense of humor. I've gotta remember "normal" people don't find it as amusing.
but the 9/11 was sudden i'll admit

I like his Explorer. Explorer is best guitar

you clearly did not read the rules

13this isn't #brony, we have standards
Timeban 'em. Let 'em cool their heels for a bit.
:)
Thanks Hatchet
did those wrap up?
Hoenn Surf theme?
It would probably be more effective than a permaban, in the long run. A permaban would get them angry and they'd either leave or whine about it in e-mail.
13all around the country, coast to coast
A timeban is more like a time-out.
/me is downloading an FiM soundboard on her phone.
00,10this should be easy

did borderlands win?
Wow, been a while since I was on here
Borderlands won
YES
BORDERLANDS
No draw. I think it's the format; no real all-consuming story.
Yes it didn't win HA! i know it sucked
now i can buy it
and Borderlands is more fun
Mirror's Edge's Still Alive < Portal's Still Alive
Too many sidequests that don't really mean anything.
11,01SuperBrony64: Dammit.
eh
i can wait

Borderlands is awesome
hands down
Cans.wave
I can't wait for Borderlands 2
got Just Cause 2 for $5, and i'll grab Borderlands for $7.50
and that'll be the only damage, minus anything awesome tomorrow
Anyone get Recettear?
I do
SOMEONE MUST STREAM RECETTEAR
8,6well, I already had it
Eh, the only thing I bought recently was Bayonetta. That one was fun.
the only thing I bought during the sale was "Poker Night at the Inventory"
Borderlands is only $7.50?
i don't know
8,6not sure if it would handle streaming well, think it only has a fullscreen option
I lost my house
More ponies?
8,6lol
I WIN
darn it
Civ 5 Gods and Kings is 25% off - is that as low as it's been?
8,6Recettear is fun, but definitely needs a solid block of time to kill if you want to play
i wouldn't reccomend it
or replay it
but it was fun for a run
want you gone
is the actual title
I hear Want You Gone
11,01I can get into Recettear in spurts.
:P
I don't play enough games like that
don't worry I'm good sport
that's one nice thing about gw2, has a personal story system for each character based on the starting choices you make
I also got Dungeon Defenders
Nah, MMO plots really don't draw me.
plus all of the side quests are "pick one of 5 different things, do any mix of them in a certain area"
I mean theoretically they would, but I can't muster the suspension of disbelief.
00,10one last song
k
No MMO can perfectly recreate the feeling of being in a fantasy world.
now i only want you gone
this is it
11,01Sumica: Minus the Sea Ponies outro?
this is . ..
now i only want you gone

Well that's as much an admission of guilt as you can get.
They just kind of melt together after a while
take loads of time to complete
and on top of that the good ones, like Tales, never get localized.
Sad Sad Sad
Hey?
If you're having to restrain yourself, go for it.

luna wants out
hi everypony
kermah?
00,02i dont think i can get them home
oh
thats something else
pwndy
maybe they can get escape velocity with their infinite but puny jetpacks.
top hanks got them home
tom*
lmao :D
such is the price of fame
aks luna to bring them back
celestia funded this?
00,02XD
00,02i'ma start going home
no
Rain: IKR
landing might be a problem though
you have to be able to have some projection, laws of physics
dat thrust.
Rain: Reentry could be a problem
but rain they dont have parachutes remember
00,02this is about as efficent as i can be
oh ._.
riding dirty
lol
they could be buried on their home planet though. or turned to ash on the way
/me shrugs
lol
because they're only going 2 mph and home is very far away and they forgot to pee before they left
00,02i might be wrong
00,02and we have plenty of fuel
00,02bob, 2
, theyre using jeypacks?, cheeters, and anyway "WALKING"involvs solid ground under one foot at all time
._. wow demo times flies
to escape, yes. To get back home, that remains to be seen.
00,02huh
00,02completly wrong way to take off
@.@
zois and n-body problems.
time for the sun
freeze
I frequently have dreams that I'm working on a moon colony.
y
:D
as long as you can get it below 70km you'll eventually get home
we see 'em rolling
lol
he made it home
Hey Rain!
00,02lolwat
kerbals can moonwalk and use jetpacks and lights and exit ship
you shifted into a higher parabolic orbit, technically.
Well that can't be good
easy way to get to earth: blow UP
dam physics, you scary
lol
NOON ONONONON
WEEEEEEEEEEEEE *BOOM*
ouch

not only are their jokes subtle and clever, and their animation is glorious
and they have a billions different subtle themes
but they can also tell a good story with all of that
