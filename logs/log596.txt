The logo seen in the final film was actually only a first-draft. It was not yet considered finished when test screenings began, but audiences reacted so positively to it that it
1,11was decided that no further work need be done.

Funfact: the proliferation of Tentacle porn in hentai is because when hentai and the like first started up, Japanese censorship laws actually prohibited the image of a penis. The tentacles were a workaround for the artists.

01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: At the party where he talks to Ramona for the first time, Scott holds up a very badly drawn picture of Ramona and asks if anyone has seen her. Director Edgar Wrightsaid Scott was originally supposed to hold up a picture of Ramona from the comic book series, but felt the silly drawing Scott holds up was more comedic.
Hardcore, like Bubbles
I friggin love this movie.
sounds a little like pony backround music
Me and Luna~ <3
scott is best artist
he draws like Rukia from Bleach. :D

Spectrum_Rush I was gonna say that!
just sign the damn package
yay
In the blooper reel that package toss took like 30 tries to get right. :D

yay
i wannted to know what taht package was
TEH HAPPEH
WRONG
That's the movie's pacing ???? :D
that trash bit took forever :D
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Scott opens the door to receive his package, Michael Cera actually did throw the package over his shoulder into the bin after 30-odd takes (most of which are seen on the "outtakes" of the DVD). However, the signature shown on-screen was a visual effect superimposed onto the paper.
