00,10noting can go wrong
yes, sorry
Silverscreen: what rap battle?
Huh
05why hello there Silverscreen, finals over?
Red October, standing by.
Silverscreen: I haven't
still looks a bit bow heavy
10But do you just sort of lay it somewhere? Not out of sight or anything?
Erm...
1,11Wrek: Nope.
Silverscreen: link pl0x?
Sumica: best spacecraft created
For the last effing time you need additional pylons, B**ch! :[
epic? wingbowner?
it will make a nice drill
No worries, I was just slightly confused :S
Those are some odd wings....
When I first saw it I thought it was spore then I notiiced how different it was
05best of luck dearie
lol
Pinkies4thWall|Xbox: oh, he IS trying to make a plane. space doesn neet wings like that
Sumica: inb4 something goes wrong
Uhh..
Pale_Horse: you stole my joke :'(
Bye! :)
Wrek doesnt this look just like the spore spaceship creator layout?
00,10flaps never work
What is this?
I think you should design it like a real space ship...
Silverscreen: link?
oh gog, win, Silverscreen
Dark_Horst: Dont question it! It looks cool!
02Sky:
brb breakfast
Silverscreen: sounds awesome
Oh I was hoping for a new pony rap battle Silverscreen

1,11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njos57IJf-0
02I usually hide it on a spare suitcase/whatever
What is this game?
forget mathematics! test it!
Does this cost money?
just more stuff to fuck around with it seems
What gameis this, and where can i pirate it for mac?
02which I lock and hide behind the main bed of the room
Silverscreen: i saw it. doesnt come close to masterchief vs leonidas
Derpy--Hooves: nope
Sumica: needs moar cowbell :)
This can't go wrong !
dinky: kerbal space program
02or below.
the tires need wings too
dinky: No need to pirate, it's freeware.
So its free :)
05,15Okay place your bets, will this ship fly?
05if i had thsi id build an Xwing
10k
Silverscreen: but yeah, it's nice
Is there a mac port?
No.
10Most hotel beds here, you can't hide stuff under the beds
I bet ded.
dinky, it's Kerbal Space Program and the earliest version is free :3
fluttercry: 9001 bits on it will
Horsepony, thing is, you can see if it is practical afterwards
Good afternoon, all! Are we ready for the BMN?
fluttercry: of course not
Morning everyone.
it will fly, but not for long
I BET 12 BITS THIS WILL FLY.
Because fuck aeronautical engineering!
10It is covered up
hai XAX
3 bits on "yes, if flying is defined as getting at least one inch into the air then going boom"
ok
1,11Masterchief vs. Leonidas? I don't know, I think the new one is better.
40 bits on that it will fly~
It looks awesome though
Looks like copy of spore spaceship creator
Deathtrap 1 just inspires greatest of competence that it will fly.
but you can only get the demo...
soooooo... how long do you think this'll stay airborne?
it's a russian rocket,so it will crash...Just kiding :)
How do you get the full verson?
05,1520 US Dollars that it will explode
100 bits that it will not leave the atmosphere
i say it explodes instantly
XD

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The script, originally a television pilot, was heavily revised to become a feature film. The "Zombie Kill of the Week" was leftover from the script's origin as a TV pilot. Every weekly episode would have a Zombie Kill of the Week performed by characters on the show.
I think the movie's only an hour and a half

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the movie 'Natural Born Killers (1994)', Robert Downey Jr.'s character coins the term 'Zombieland' when talking about television audiences. That film starred Woody Harrelson.
Quite badass, if I do say so myself
