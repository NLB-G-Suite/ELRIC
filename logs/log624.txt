I like to draw whatever I can. As long as it motivates me.

I like to draw, but I haven't been very inspired lately. :<
I've mostly been drawing my Nuzlocke comic, but artwise, it's more than a little half-assed.

Ello there everypony.
Hiyo Malevolent
Hows it going Malevolent?
I'm quite well.
It's like switching back to 1080p.
Same here. It's called being near-sighted
Without my glasses, I can't see anything unless it's like two inches away from my face.
Plus, glasses look cool.
Yeah. I try to read things far rarely, but mainly I just use them (Why not?)
Lol
Not that I was ever a popular kid to begin with, but that really didn't help
Where I live when I was young, people called my four eyes. * cracks necks * Never actually liked be calling that.
And today you can see people wearing glasses even if they don't have any sight problems.
I try not to care, but I just have too many feels in my system. >=\
:P Strange how people work huh?
I know right?
Not really.
Most of people are predictable.
It pisses me off sometimes how easily hurt I am by words. It's stupid.
Most. But I mean how we as a society change through the years.
Not individuals/
D'awww. (Why am I d'awing?)
I been called 4 eyes too
Brb.
but as I got older, I didn't care much
Yep
Them feels, man. Them feels.
Some less, some more than others
Sticks and stones :P
Trout and tuna.
I usually tend to ignore insults
Social outcasts unite?
I find it easy for some reason
Ugh! Where are my sneakers?!
much
Never mind. Found them in my bookbag.
Ah'm gehven' 'er ohl sheh's goht!

Ohh, Pen and paper?
Oh
Roleplaying is magic
OK:S
Ooh, tabletop. I've always wanted to try that!
ok i get it D:<
You can
of course
DnD has a RP client that's really cool
RPTools
/me is a tabletop newb and has no idea how any of it works, but wants to try it anyway
you can probably play tabletop ponies with RPTools
YARR ME HEARTIES
yarr! We be poirits!
Yarrrr!
I used to play tabletop DnD with my cousin, really fun
where the gamemaster can keep all the stats and information, and change his name and whisper easily
Talking gamemaster is best gamemaster
yaeh-
It'd be an interesting thing to do.
told*
:>
lol
what's fun with PNP is that you can do anything you want, gamemaster just has to interpret it into the rules
but in pony rp, combat is rare anyway
PNP?
yeah-
pen and paper
Oh
yeah, fun, heh.
ADVENTUUUUUUUUUURE~
it's best if everyon stays in character and stuff-
Damn, you fiend!

I'm actually surrounded by instruments atm
i'm surrounded by all sorts of performing arts crap, like easels and canvases and musical instruments, etc
are you a gearhead?
gearhead?
like- collect guitar amps or something
no, i don't collect them
I want to- but money
i just have 1 of everything i need, as of yet
I've got.. 4 amps I think
although it's gonna cost me a lot for my bass
yeah
I've got a 1970s peavey 400 (they go for like 150 bucks, but are amazing) and a Hartke5500 for bass
Hiya
since there's no stream; http://www.effectpowersupplies.com/aria-igb-std-1609-p.asp
that's the bass i'm looking towards
Heya everypony
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_qp6Z7BmA I don't know, I really like the lyrics, no matter how pessimistic it may be.
Looks pretty neat
I've got.. 8 basses I think <,<
I kinda want something with that pickup, after hearing Blur
hehehe
Years of saving money and being poor
Aah yeah-
I got my first bass when I was..14, Fender precision from my cousin, used and beaten up. And then I didn't get anymore until I was 19 or 20
i've been getting money by dogsitting. not hard work, but it's slow cash. good enough for me, at any rate
income is good, even if it is low
I want an SG too-

Aah, Epiphone is pretty good for their price though
Aaw
The other seller refused to ship outside of USA
byy
I also like Teisco and unbranded japanese 60's instruments- crazy cheap and wonky sound
http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4463327534_60b6735e98_o.jpg I mean look at this, Musima Eterna, DDR Guitar from the 60s-70s
Aah, that's mean
i'm fully proficient in bass, and semi-proficient in guitar (can't do lead, only rhythm)
I'm proficient, but I can't say I'm fully proficient in bass
well, i say "fully proficient", i mean i can play just about anything that's put in front of me, with a little time and practise
yeah
cya
I'm pretty good at reading fast, but I tend to jam along on first try, great exercise in playing with others is to play songs you don't know
Bye :)

The only lessons I've had was during that college year
Great teacher, focused mainly on holding beat and improvising-
and one of those happened to be a cello lesson

My school sucks.
But it's really hard.
Everyone in my school is an imbecile.
Poofing, huh? That's always fun.
It proves to be very hard. Many pitch chages, and it's difficult for me to hit such high notes.
I go to a community college, I am afraid I am smarter than some of my teachers
Wait....are we actually watching an episode?
:O
wat really?
/me sucks Jmo's face
Well that's something.
Personally I find making friends in school to be a waste of time. Friends are annoying.

you said it twice- about that certain channel
But... the adult smurfs are kind of weirding me out.
cmon guyz, one more time

Okay, they're not aliens. They're the natives of another planet
It's a strict nono to post other chans
Sucks to be you then.

08,01AlphaThroughZeta: it's still channel advertising, and it's against our rules, which you would do good to go read
doesn't matter there are rules
We're not allowed to post profiles either, I think?
08,01BronyInstrumental: awesome!
Is this the daft Punk movie?
Pfft, you ignored one of the rules a minute ago Saturn.
just realise that all mods are spiderman
08,01Meanwhile: i did not! i gave myself permission to post a non-image link!
Bad example. Tut tut.
i dont understand why people say breakfast cereal. is there a such thing as a lunch or supper cereal?
Ooh, enchanced clip:O
if he says its fine then its fine :P
00,10because earth needs music
you are alowed to post non image links if a mod explicitly allows youn to. saturn is a mod
I should go running but I have a headache. Should I go or not?
08,01"Video links and links to external sites are not allowed during streams unless you are given permission by a moderator."

and before the great animation strike that ruined Walt's relationship with his animators
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwww bloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
08,01dat 1940s recording sound...
Why doesn't anything get animated like this anymore?

lol its a Goldeen
:D Blubblubs
oh hawt silouette
Saturn . . . -_(\ how did I not remember that? I watched the entire series and researched a bit of it, including the animation.
00,10well before little mermade

Y U forget?

Very very much longer, yeah- the inbetweening and colouring- I have no idea how many cells was in this movie, but -- one simpsons episode was..3500 cells? and that's cheap and 22 minutes

/me join dashiesauce

h+ohe0rhjperjghp¨wejg
08,01also, Fantasia doesn't have felt.
I think I hear an oboe
08,01or Pinkie Pie, for that matter
Saturn: :D
darn
08,01Tovler: it's actually a cor anglais, i think
I like Pinkie Pie
08,01hey guys, why's a cor anglais called a cor anglais?
dunno
08,01because when anglais saw it, he went "cor!"
cause its an angelic choir?
Saturn: they forgot the "blimey" then :D
Dah, english horn would have been my second guess.
08,01and anglais is english
Ooh, yes-
08,01so it's literally the english horn
I take it most of the songs are from tchaikovskys
/me remembers fighting Dream Eaters w/ this in the BG
seems legit
wouldn't doubt it
Yeah we in Russia have dancing flowers
<Quick_Thinker> hi
Fairiesss :3
Fantasia
wow... I can see parts of the stream without reloading constantly... wut is this magic?
did night on bald mountain play yet?
08,01cracks me up every time!
I can play a recorder . . .
sort of
and a ukelele
sort of
08,01i play the cello
08,01Tovler: i think you just missed that
Animation is- beautiful
08,01DUUUUUH DUUUUUH DUUUUUUUUH DIDDLY DUM DUM
Gah! Why does everybody I know have more talent for musical instruments then me? My friend can play the Sax for crying out loud!
How saxy.
XD
08,01epic cello moment
00,10and this is all from befire they had any kind of computeres
most animation is still handdrawn
Remember, up until S14 Simpsons was drawn with the exact same techniques as this movie
08,01Canadian_Brony: well, to be fair, i have more musical talent than most people...
00,10even the editing was all done by hand
00,10just clips that I can find
And Winter!
I have huge amount of respect for the colour ladies and men, and the inbetweeners-
08,01Canadian_Brony: i'm a classically trained bass
I guess the Fantasia thing with the dinosaurs is too long
00,10this the one Saturn?
08,01rite of spring! rite of spring! rite of spring!
?
08,01Sumica: yup!
Yep
Is that a Bassoon?
08,01Tovler: it is!
08,01so the Rite of Spring is the piece of music that's playing behind this
Saturn I'm a treble. Not as good as I used to be, and a significantly lower range, but I can still put on a show.
08,01Sumica: aye, i thought the pitch was off

damnit jiggly puff *snore*
08,01i regard him as really the remnants of the impressionist
HISTORY
08,01but feel free to disagree with me
yep
good
or at least 50% it
08,01this was somethign that audiences of the time were really not used to
Saturn: can we agree he was an awesome musician? :)
what's this?
08,01MadSurge: of course!
fantasia
08,01in fact, this is possibly my favourite piece of orchestral music of all time
or somethin' like that
00,10I like this part
Clips from Fantasia, at the least.
clips from fantasia to be exact, not the whole thing
08,01so The Rite of Spring was oriignally conceived as a ballet
this was a ballet?
volcanoes?
in a ballet?
I need to get out more
08,01anyhoos
00,10this must have been a bitch to get the tieming set
^
and there went earth
This is rather like 2001, but animated in this clip.
evening XAXy
08,01so this was a ballet, and it was choreographed by Vaslav Nijinkski
Skipping spring. Going straight to geological summer
And then the earth died.
08,01the choreography he made for the piece was equally striking, especially to audiences of that time
Dat primordial earth
08,01it featured scantily clad young women dancing in jutting, fierce movements
<.<
08,01bear in mind that this premiere took place in France in 1913
oh cool
08,01an actual riot
1913 AND THEY WERE ANGRY AT IT FUCK THEM
Hehe
Saturn: fucking imbecils
seriously this is a master piece
Things take time
08,01this drove Stravinsky into a depression
Well, they didn't like that sort of choreography.
Of the impressionist, I only really know Arne Nordheim
:o
00,10spore, the animation
i mean wow
1913 is the music, the naimation is 1940
spore before spore
If those 1913 people thought they were mad, I hate to imagine how they reacted to jazz.
Saturn: are we suddenly talking about the rite of spring?
1940 okay thats still amazing
hey guys, just got done installing guild wars 2 and now my charr needs a name. any ideas?
mc hoofer
oh, cool
ikr
tab fail
Sealife! :3
08,01again, feel free to disagree with me
Yeah tab fail. Roll Fizzlebeef.
stop doing that
I know way too little about classical music
Saturn I got nothin'
Have you heard Nordheim Saturn? Impressionism and modernism dude
I can't argue with something I know nothing about
00,10I cant disagree due to lack of knolage on the subject
hm, I thought Man-o-wars floated on the surface
Saturn: I can't disagree. But along came the Bolsheviks, and they ruined it for everyone. Including the Bolsheviks.
I can't disagree due to no knowledge on the subject.
well Saturn, looks like you're he einstein of early music here
man i cant imagine how pissed this made other religions
*nibbles ribs and watches*
08,01this is some of the latest music i'm really interested in
Saturn: do go on :) I'm interested!
this isnt really early music
Saturn: you don't like modern music?
well I know this wasn't in the classical era
08,01i consider renaissance and baroque to be early music
well
I consider this to be early music
I like most 1920+, there's very few things I don't like. Harshnoise and stuffi ncluded
08,01Dken2021: aye; this was 2 'eras' after. classical -> romantic -> 20th century
lyre is early music
THIEF
is this song even 100 years old?
99
they could have sccrapped this idea becuase they feared it might fail, but they stuck to thier guns and man did it pay off

is it me, or is that really old animation way more carefully done than most of todays animations?
yes
OK-- Walt was NOT smoking his usual cigar when he thought of THIS.

No CGI animals or burp and fart jokes

we're at ostriches?
08,01so there's a pisstake of this piece called Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah

Saturn yes, its all I can think of.
yes, i have saturn
Oh yeah. I remember that, vaguely
08,01it's about a jewish boy writing home to his parents abotu being on camp
we should start doing animations frame by frame again...
Saturn: I have. Haven't heard it in a while.
NOOOOO THE GRAPES
I thought old naimation still used two's?

Ello everypony
not the slimest hippo I've seen

bonjour
08,01Klumzeedragon: ooo, i've not heard that
dat hippo
Saturn: I think it was for... Advantix?
08,01MadSurge: animated on twos means that the animation frame only changes ever second frame of film
whole lota plot in this is my only comment
08,01*every
Saturn: no, I mean the piece on the jewish boy

The quality looks a bit high for this to be the uncensored version.
dunno about you guys, but i think this is beautiful as fuck
I like the animation... but the noses.....
08,01i want to be one of those pegasi :(
Don't compare this to G3:|
