"Put a sentence you think I would never say in my ask. " I put "I love Shibi" in his ask
oni_link: the fix can be as simple as a regimen of physical therapy to strengthen the muscles in the knee
or may require surgery
Sounds like an arrow to the...NVM.
lol
Holy crap sad animation is sad
Unnr: I was hoping to get back to the National Guard but if I get surgery, thats a no
Dark92Enigma: Basically until the newsletter is fixed, the way they're doing lotto is during BMN intermission (This week on Saturday) they open a special lotto room. You go in that room and they pick four random people in the chat and those people pick the movies/pony eps
Yep, I've seen that one :(
Kawaii_icybeauti: i think that jokes dead
oni_link: as I said, it depends on how sever it is
Kawaii_icybeauti: more like a bail to the knee
HoodyNinja, makes you cry more than MLD
CrimsonPhoenix: Not for me
in minor cases its just a matter of an exercise routine
But half the picks went to MODs
JESmith71: OK, thank you......
Cuz he doesn't love me ;W ;
:)
NOW i'm off
But I am (currently) not a doctor, so I could be completely wrong
CrimsonPhoenix: no, plz not that, ive had enough sadness
JESmith71: Do they announce when the room is open?
I went to the spike room....not the prettiest place...
Want sad stuff?
superretroworld, it's ok to shed a tear ocasionally

Zamer have ya seen the Wizard Driver? lol henshin music is kinda catchy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70OydsglvBY

That might have been the worse time to walk away from the computer
TBH , I never saw the opening for this game :D
Oh hi sumica

ah okay good thing I played the game lready deffienatly a good game.
Shizuka: sorry about ruining the game I get angry too easily when I start to lose repeatedly.
I skipped it :P
buffer!

Sumica<3
oh nevermind
Hey NICO cousin,lets go BOWLING lol
its more fun killing yourself in that game then the story
so I com back after hearing the stream over my youtube video and see a male domitrix beating someone
what a perfectly good waste of diamond
Sketch_Toku_Brony: for the last time Roman, NO
I like how that diamond thing seems to not even have any bearing in the story laterin this game
Is the stream wonking out for anyone else?
Or atleast i missed it
Probably the streaming?
stupid ad, I don't have wrinkles ;_;
lol
F*CKING WINDOWS SEVEN
HoodyNinja adblock plus yo
Windowed is not your friend on GTA4 :(
Zamer: actually female dominatrix whipping a guy
Upgrade from windows 95?
Sumica: compatibility mode?
F*yay*Kin' Windows 98! :[ lol
Sumica: you have this through steam right?
Sumica: you just go to the shortcut and right click
it';s that koky cousin
We need a staples button
my computer would proabably explode if i tired to play gta 4 windowed
Hey cousin, it is your cousin!
Braeburne!
Sketch_Toku_Brony screw 98 man it's time to go 95 up here
twilight_sprinkle: its slready done that too us with tf2
Actually, I need a button that can play any song I want at any time and everyone around me can hear it
yikes thats a mess. I think you can just do what otakon said. Find the link in the steam game files and run it in compatibility mode.
Niko Bellick will now be played by AJ
Sumica: try setting the launch option to -noborder maybe that'll work
True men use windows 95
Zamer i know it was from the South Park movie lol
superretroworld: tf2 has high requirements?
Brucie will be played by Rainbow Dash.
oh poo
Packie will be Pinkie Pie.
Sumica: you'll have to go into the main program files to set up compatibility mode
twilight_sprinkle: but its slow unless you have a fast computer
Hrm... Fluttershy... Could be... Malory?
Naaah
Dwane = Cranky Doodle?
so what is this week's movie night anyone know?
Fall through the ground?
What?
Zamer I think A is Over the Hedge
superretroworld: ah thats bad, i was thinking of trying it some time, but skyrim lags for me even at 800x600 <.<
ooh nice
Sumica: If you have a steam version of the game the compatibility tab will not appear by clicking on the game icon. Instead, highlight your Steam folder, right click on the file called Steam.exe, left click on properties, then on the compatibility tab and change. In addition, in your Steam folder, go to Steam Apps > common > name of game > name of game.exe, right click for properties, choose the compatibility tab and change
superretroworld: thats 800x600 + two optimization mods
oh, well lottery winings are on the front page
found on the forums
Vlad is now Gilda
twilight_sprinkle: at least you can run it. I can only dream until I get my desktop so it sits there in my Library collecting dust
twilight_sprinkle: is it the pc version?
Who needs ground?
Headless, wingless pinkestia is starting to creep me out
since when do you need ground?
Unnr: the hell did you find that?
superretroworld: yeah, consoles dont have mods
otakon: I am working on a celestia to chrysalis custom
needs more Antartician women
Unnr: oh
but she's smaller than Tia
But in the process, its creepy
Zamer: all the womens
Roman has all the womens. ALL of them. :|
Otakon, I am cutting down the legs, resculpting the joints to do that creepy extended thing
as a result she should be shorter
^ but Rome fell for having too many women
Dwayne should be rarity actually
also filing down the plot and re-sculpting it to be approps flatter
Zamer: *claps*
Though, otakon, if you look, Chrysalis isn´t that diffrently sized
http://i.imgur.com/lAvpE.jpg
I LIKE VIDEO GAMES
What happened?
HoodyNinja: whats your favourite?
hes' setting it up to run better
Someone set us up the bomb lol
Chrysalis is bigger
right
taller, but skinnier
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5KrGlnBVkE
cachi01|mobile: maybe height due to sheer horn length
HoodyNinja we all do son we all do :)
/me has gta4 for computer even though i can hardly run it :D
superretroworld: Franchise or game? And for story or gameplay?
if it's not E.T. go home
HoodyNinja: just favourite game, doesnt matter
best game ever
Edwardo talked in english instead of spanish in the latin version
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YqIiiPZyDk&feature=watch_response probably one of the best versions of this Ninja Gaiden classic :3
So in mexico its
Sumica: any luck?
Yes, me gustan las papas
0,5Nini guys
superretroworld: Okay then, based on story and originality I would say dead space
Wizard one ring to rule them all
superretroworld: System Shock 2
Nini means good night, right?
One of the best, creepy, interesting games ever made
08,01i am now using this for all future placeholder text generation: http://www.fiftyshadesgenerator.com/

00,10steam said you should not run compatabilty mode
desk*
chat ded?
08,01thank Unnr for that; they gave me the link
:3
Zamer lol probably though i like the dragon upgrades,kinda remind me of kuuga's rising forms
Sumica: you have to go into the games individual .exe file
oh god dat 50 shades of gray :|
Sumica: If you have a steam version of the game the compatibility tab will not appear by clicking on the game icon. Instead, highlight your Steam folder, right click on the file called Steam.exe, left click on properties, then on the compatibility tab and change. In addition, in your Steam folder, go to Steam Apps > common > name of game > name of game.exe, right click for properties, choose the compatibility tab and change
No my chat froze
YOU SHALL NOT RUN COMPATIBILITY MODE
Yay im back

00,10yeah i already did that, it just has to do first time set ups because the game has changed
No stream?

Dken2021: Because sex sells?
Dken2021: Wait wait wait, what fanfic?
Sumica: here we go
Barbetos: 50 shades of grey started life as a Twilight Fanfic
Dken2021 shades of gray is a fanfic?
seems to be working so far
It was then re-edited, the names replaced, and released
cachi01|mobile heard it started out as one
HoodyNinja: shame on me
O_o
50 shades of gray makes porn? I thought it was a book!
LAWL
Unnr Huh. Silly internet. Is it the same author atleast?
so far so good
Like, a real book
awsome
And yet it's a popular book?:S
Sumica: that did it man
lol wut
Same author of the fanfic
at least
HoodyNinja: It's a book. Full of porn.
Good
Sumica: it's running way faster too, and your welcome :P
sometimes my computer stops working and it takes awhile before it logs out on its own
wouldnt surprise me since immedietly near the end of the movies it came out and picked up by every women in the universe
I gave useful info for once
SOMEONE NOTARIZE THAT !
AJIsAwesome: It has sold over 40 million copies
Sumica: is good on this endo too, smooth frames, no flicker!!!!

Reikim|Streamless: Oh I know it exists i just don't give a shit
twilight_sprinkle: actually it was a big vat of cake batter
literary porn which women will always deny it isn't
AJIsAwesome: That means more copies of the book have been sold, than there are people living in scandanavia
I like Niko but I don't like this game

I wonder if it's possible for you to just throw a driver out of his car, change his radio to something completely unlike what he had before, get out of the car and run away while the owner of the car reacts to his radio being messed up.

Hi Pinkies4thWall
05it took me 6 tries to kill this spider jsut now
05dayum wasnt it durable
Unnr: D'aww... cute
Niko's such a rebel he takes dayquil at night.
How big was it?
Wrek: What did the little spider ever do to you?
4chan has a policy against hotlinking from one website to theirs. I suppose it would make sense for the webchat to attach a referrer link to everything.
must have been one hell of a spider Wrek
O hi Wrek, God of gaming. master of DOOM.
Unnr: it apparently repeatedly dodged ;)
MakerDusk: :D

spiders are hard to kill, theyre fast, crawl in the tiniest of holes, and are strong
YourLittleDashie: I always liked http://imgur.com/a/W7WAQ#5
/me can be an evil pony :s
Hey Sumica, can you go on a Random killing spree, classic GTA free roam play?
i probably kileld like a hundred spiders in my room
BTW, did Sumica ever finish that game published by the company that we all hate?
EA i bet
Kandarihu: does Apple make their own games now?
MakerDusk: Evil is such a strong word
:p
yeah, nobody like EA, though the lord of the rings games were good
/me cough
twilight_sprinkle, yeah. Did he finish the game by EA that he's just recently picked up again?
ohai MakerDusk, its been a while
heya twilight_sprinkle
carbombs
and yes, I do still live
carbombs are fun, i like letting people steal my car and then blow em up
Kandarihu: idk
LIAR!
Bullshit@!

twilight_sprinkle: at least they have the courtesy to steal it first
yay funfair

A spider man, a spider man, Wrek is afraid of a spider man! :D

MASF123: although the killer was kinda anticlimactic imo, but other than that the eps were goodd
Bowl LIKE A BAWS
And then my Internet frooze up >_<

twilight_sprinkle: Dammit I'm sad again: http://derpy.me/1rYEr

I just had an awesome tf2 run!

13so pc right, is the installation process still as awful as i've heard?
13where you have to make like six accounts
Well, Liberty City seems to be a pastiche of New York City, where guns are outlawed. Naturally, there IS a lot of gunviolence there.
naturally
quick
we need trollghost back in here
surely he has a solution
it's a funny little thing that seems so obvious Kandarihu...
"Crime tends to go down when LESS things are crimes"
why would they heal you after you shot them up?
yus
I will be there in an hour, cousin.
Ohai Shizuka
MirrorImage, we had a big debate earlier today over the 2nd amendment.
13it opened up massive
Kandarihu - you can have your bear arms, i just want the claws
oh i remember that shitstorm...twas chaotic
those things are delicious!
i remember it like it was yesterday
is it time to talk about the rooty tooty point and shooty MURIKA shitstorm?
13nope it is time to talk about what we learned today
13and so what we have leaaarned applies to our lives today~
13and god has a lot to say in his book~
"I learned that teleporting choppers have right-of-way at all intersections"
holy fuck that helicopter crushed that poor bastard

http://www.guildwars2countdown.com/ just few seconds
Allegra's Window
sounds like a shitty spin off of charlotte's web
Buytoast, in other words, reference crude stereotypes of people who excercise basic rights?
Oh man, I was too distracted to pay attention to that which I personally asked for. Terribly sorry, Sumica.
A-MUUUUURIKA, A-MUUUUUURIKA
Night, everypony. I'm turning in.
God claps his hands for theeeeeeee!\
13sumica on his way to work
not in the same way as the more traditional "life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness"
nooo, not a 2nd amendment argument
13nopony still got my reference .-.
13makes me sad
And pop a cap, in every ass
05the right to defend yourself? sure i can see the basic right in that.
from sea to shining seeeeeeeaaaa!
Bye, twilight_Sprinkle :)
05right to a gun? nope
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Newbie Artist Training Grounds II: Day 27
Wrek ^
+1, end of conversation
Shizuka: the most i can thnk of is wheel of morality from animaniacs, sorry
13not even close...
Wrek, then with what? Blocking bullets with a sword?
I tryed
wait
05im not sayign guns arent covered under
i know
the 700 Club
13how is it i am the only pony here who learned the basics of morality from talking vegetables on a kitchen counter :<
i have'nt seen veggietales in years
veggie tales Shizuka ?
05im jsut saying that statign "aownign a gun is a right" seems way to narrowed.
05and gives too much leway
Shizuka - because i'm from MURIKA and was too busy watching people drive around in circles for 400+ miles?
last one i saw was that vhs with the fuckers from flibberoroo who wore pans and shit on their heads
13it was more of a kettle buytoast
a gun doesnt really offer much protection, if a criminal plans to attack you, he'll do it in a way you wont see coming and youll be defensless anyway
whatever it was
they were on those high ass hills
and throwing shit at each other
13the women and men, since 1710, wore on their heads one large shoe
05stating "right to defend yourself" makes more sense since then its up to the person in question whether they want a gun t protect them or a back o bricks.
05jsut a personall opinnion on the matter
and then it had some space shit
but
All the color
i do like the hairbush song bit
13the USS Applepies~
oh this wont end well...
that was catchy as all hell
if you pre-emptively strike first, then you won't get shot.
13oh wheeeeeeere is my hairbrush
OH WHEEEEEEEER IS MY HAIRBRUSH?
13larry, an early brony just looking to brushie brushie
/me becomes a hairbrush for Shizuka :3
13oh where oh where oh where oh where oh wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeere
13is mah hairbrush
05hekc ints only in the past year we've been needingto review the gunlaws over here because frankly. its never been ap roblem
/me never experienced what brushing your hair is actually like
all i remember is that the asshole who took the hairbrush sounded like that voice box talking guy from south park
05ps: im typing liek shit due to sleep deprivation
"Thanks for the hairbrush."
13the peach later became an IRS agent
you stole it you assholwe

13can you at least take out trees this time or are they still invincible
it has better acceleration, but it cant stand up to thw same amount of punishmwent
Did I just hear a woman shout "ANOTHER DAY IN LIBERTY CITY!"?
yup
Shizuka: even worse that before
she's right you know
13hey i recognize that corner from a screenshot
oh its gangstarr
13wonder if you can still get a combine harvester
Shizuka: in the older games you'd atleast sometimes bounce of the trees, in this you'll be stuck to 'em like glue
run forrest!

I know this is a fan-made deal, but I have a gripe about DK kidnapping Peach...he's never actually done that in any of the Mario or DK games...it was always Paulina, the Mushroom Kingdom's top celebrity (an actress, if I remember the canon correctly)
WHUWHUWHUUUUU?
This is all kinds of awesome
oh god, cmc space program
buck yea Dram Master!
Dream*
00,10let me guess Phase4, you want that one

Phase4: (Insert over used quote from Portal here)
Sumica, cmc + ksp = BEST SPACE
Can anyone else identify the game this song is actually from, 'cause it's not from Contra
i think its a custom mix of many songs
Nope, that song was from one game
It was from Batman for the NES
should have had super mario underwater theme
SuperBrony64: you streaming?

Good morning Bronystate! :)
/me hugs MadSurge
I love how no one even notices Fillyshy plummetting to the ground.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #421
Mornin' MadSurge
And hello there MadSurge!
dat face
Inb4 HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGHHHHH
00,10that reminds me, i wonder if "a world with out rainbows" has updated at all
What's that? a fanfic?
00,10yeah
is that one of those stupid alternate reality ones?
00,10a duel universe thing where in one univers dash never did the rainboom
Dang it you computer and your derps. I can't wait for my new computer anymore!
well, at least it's not that stupid one about rainbow bitch joining the shadowbolts
Oh boy, time for the worst episode yet :|
MadSurge: woo
00,10no instead dash was killed by NMM before the story evr realy started
00,10Twi never became celestias student
becuase i cant see that BLOWING UP IN YOUR FACE
so an evil entity that wasn't even around at the time the protagonists were born somehow kills one of them in early childhood?
（╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
00,10no Buytoast, dash trys to fight back with a bunch of otheres from the flight school
00,10but because twi was never celestias student she was't in time to stop NMM from taking over
Chat is pretty darn quiet
Well that was weird. I was confused as to why the video I was watching sounded echo...y. I had started a video with the MLP opening theme AS SOON as this episode started.
:D
ah
sounds 2dark2edgy4deep4me
00,10but you have the moon side twi finding about the sun side twi and well wanting a better life for her self.
00,10swaps places with her.
00,10but she is found out.
00,10eventaly you end up with all of them on the moon side trying to put a stop to NMM
00,10but yeah it's a bit dark.
Sounds interesting... I have only read three fanfics.
Not really interested in fanfics, no matter how nice they sound...
00,10normaly I dont go for dark but this is well done so I can live with it
i stopped reading fanfics long ago
00,10Noting wrong with that MadSurge
Any good ones out there other than, My Little Dashie, Friendship is Tragic, and Ballad of Twilight Sparkle?
i never read fanfic
Sumica: why thanks for understanding :)
00,10I need to go through alot of my old ones and see if they updated
hell, i've only written two and one of em was on that equestria daily thing
hi everypony
Hello somepony_else
00,10all the ones I like seem to update slowly
I just get bored and sometimes a fanfic can kill an hour or two, I've never really been big into them either, but recently I've gpne through those ones.
Hey somepony_else
xD
00,10probably why they are good to me
00,10cause they take time to put them out

I'm doin' pretty well, Jmo. Woke up in a relatively good mood. =)
That's good to hear! Hopefully that good mood carries throughout the day.
Yup. That's always favorable.
Wrek: Well! That escalated quickly.
That's great Gold_Demona :3
LOL! Wow, Wrek! XD
What band is this? And... Are they saying "Conando?"
And am I correct in assuming that all of us watching get a signed, free, print of this awesomeness?
05commando
lol, ok. That makes more sense
Wrek Augmentation on twi?
05aye
Hehe
She didn't ask for this
:P
i knew one of you fuckers was going to make that joke
05nano aug to be exact
I can't even tell what language this is
05about a generation after the mecha augs
Dem eyes
Wrek Makes sense, No need for any physical removal
Wrek Hmm any idea how the nano augs improve her abilities?
Buytoast: Lol. What's being drawn? Im not watching.
XAX nano aug'd twillight

Buytoast What a shame,

Nope
Hardly spoilers if at all
05darmal armor, sigh enhancement, com link
05dermal*
05sight*

Wrek Ah i see, So magic is pretty much the same except she can most likely do alot more precise things with the augs?
05mhm
Heh,
05a heroes path is a hazardous path, whom few finds the end out of. he walks through blood through fire and through war untill he reaches the heroes grave.

Ensiferum?
Oooh, Wrek's going all realism with ponies? ;)
realism?
Is he using a draw pad?
as in anime or human like ponies?
xD
I think he means with the detailed firearm Pearly
Vordox: I'm assuming.. yes
Bye, everypony, g2g ^_^
Ahhhh.... oh wow... Pearly likes to see when they are done
Bye Pinkie_Brony!
Bye

Wrek: This is Ensiferum correct?

oh they are on something else?
Yay I completed a Braid level 100% :D
Wewt!
decide
He's cleaning it up right now.
x
xD*
I'm really curious about where you are going with your art style, Wrek.
Any certain points you're trying to affix to?
Pearly likes to draw.. mostly anime and other things..
I like to draw whatever I can. As long as it motivates me.
xD
I like to draw, but I haven't been very inspired lately. :<
I've mostly been drawing my Nuzlocke comic, but artwise, it's more than a little half-assed.
same here
well what Klumzeedragon said
it's my job, basically.. It would be interesting if I tell the whole world, that I am a briny.. in my area.. after I put a pony on my flyers... oh well Pearly doesn't care
Yeah, the last thing I drew was an OC Pony. :D I need to finish it though.
05ok this gona take ages
haha wow, I wonder if it will get a rise out of people... on fiverr "draw you as a pony"
You're doing good though Wrek. :3
Wrek, ages, really?? I hope it doesn't I want to be able to hg wrek and pearly would miss wrek..
:D

Got some Amon Amarth in that epic library of yours?

Ello there everypony.
'ello Malavolent
Hiyo Malevolent
hey there Malavolent
Hows it going Malevolent?
I'm quite well.
Got new glasses today.
Awesome! Are they super fancy?
I love getting new glasses. The world looks brand new every time. =)
Eeyup.
It's like switching back to 1080p.
Every time I take my glasses off I see stuff getting blurry the farther it is.
Same here. It's called being near-sighted
Without my glasses, I can't see anything unless it's like two inches away from my face.
Plus, glasses look cool.
Yeah. I try to read things far rarely, but mainly I just use them (Why not?)
Nowadays they're cool. When I was a kid, glasses were the bane of my popularity. =/
True.
Lol
Not that I was ever a popular kid to begin with, but that really didn't help
Where I live when I was young, people called my four eyes. * cracks necks * Never actually liked be calling that.
And today you can see people wearing glasses even if they don't have any sight problems.
But now I don't care what people say
I try not to care, but I just have too many feels in my system. >=\
:P Strange how people work huh?
I know right?
D'awwww Gold_Demona.
Not really.
Most of people are predictable.
/me hugs Gold_Demona
/me hugs Pearly back.
It pisses me off sometimes how easily hurt I am by words. It's stupid.
Most. But I mean how we as a society change through the years.
/me glomps Gold_Demona
Not individuals/
D'awww. (Why am I d'awing?)
I been called 4 eyes too
Brb.
/me is glomped by Jmo. XD
Ohai Jmo
Hai Gold_Demona :>
but as I got older, I didn't care much
DemoPegono: Because of the feeeeeeeeeels.
... tis be true.
Yep
Them feels, man. Them feels.
Gold_Demona, I'm easily hurt by words too.
"Words don't hurt anybody" people say, but they don't get so insulted on an oridinary basis.
Exactly, MASF123
Some less, some more than others
Sticks and stones :P
Trout and tuna.
/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
I usually tend to ignore insults
well, lets just say that I had a hard life but I didn't care much anymore on what anypony says
Social outcasts unite?
I find it easy for some reason
Sticks and stones will help me forget of the insults once I end my life. Lol.
AdamTheDuck: I try to, but it's not that easy for me. =\
Ugh! Where are my sneakers?!
No MASF123 ! FIGHT THE POWAH
Under your bed!
AdamTheDuck, she can't take mych more captain!
MASF123: Whaaaaaa?! D:
much
Gold_Demona, you heard me dammit.
Never mind. Found them in my bookbag.
Ah'm gehven' 'er ohl sheh's goht!
Oh Gold_Demona >.>
lol
For some reason I'm calm in the chatroom in the morning, but hyper at night.
DemoPegono: Night person? I know I am. Only reason I'm on dayshift schedule is because my husband is.
But I function better at night
05not too shabby
Lookin' good, Wrek. =D
Looks damn good!
Huh. I'm 13. Guess it was when I was born.
If you have a smokey barrel, may need a shell casing?
Oooo. I see. Disregard that statement then.
xD
?
05the itnernam mehcanism rotates it and stores the empty casign in the mag
6_9 Okie dokie lokie~
Uhh... me only understand to shoot firing thing.

Sometimes I forget that there are teenagers in the fandom, lol XP
05u desperately need a nap
Dat Desktop.
05hope ya like the short drawing session
I love watching you art, Wrek. =)
Thanks for the stream Wrek
I am a new-fresh teen. 13 to be exact.
It was pretty awesome to watch!
We did Wrek , thanks :)
Great music choices too/
05Klumzeedragon: you should drop by when i do a proper session
05i barely did anythign this one x3
DemoPegono: Well, you're in for either the best years of your life or the worst. Either way, you'll probably come out of it a better person.
Ha ha. I plan on dropping by a lot more for sure.
Yeah. I want to be a philosypher. * this guy tginks a lot *
*thinks
That's really cool. I love philosophy. =)
Philosopher you mean.
Okay
Philosopher. Noted.
Very interesting stuff, that.
He said Philosypher. Let him be a Philosypher.
>.>
:D
Philosophy has so much religion in it, but one man can follow only one of those religions.
lol, that looks like it'd be pronounced "fill-oh-SYE-fer"
/me is still unsure of his faith :P
Praise Lord Smooze! ^_^
Nothing can stop the Smooze!
Who is Smooze?
The whole world will be consumed by his Ooze! ^_^
I was confirmed Lutheran, do not know what I believe anymore.
Here DemoPegono. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CnOysetlQw
Maybe I'll follow the church of Unitology!
:P
Praise Pearly, so thenshe can make you feel happy with streamers :D
Cult Leader Fluttershy says that if we put mud on or faces in a spa we will please Lord Smooze. :)
What the hay?
gtg
If it pleases Lord Smooze, then it must be done. =D
Bye DemoPegono
:D Later DemoPegono!
Later DemoPegono
For Smooze! \^_^/
/me hugs Gold_Demona
Haha, I just remember what my friend put on the census for his religion
/me hugs Pearly back
He said he was a Neoist
And now for the chant of Fluttershy. yay...
yay~
and that one day a douchebag with sunglasses will come down one day and save us all from the machines
I couldn't stop laughing :D
lol
I used to believe in Celesia as my God, but now it's all Smooze.
Celestia
And before Celestia was Sweet Tooth and before that was Super Mario and before that wad God.
was
I pray to the Marker. But maybe Smooze will consume my thoughts.
I used to be religious like you... But then I took a Smooze ball to the knee. >_>
._.
Maybe praying to Smooze will get the stream back up.
/me kneels for Lord Smooze
Praise Smooze!~ D:
/me whispers...for Smooze.
It was supposed to be SuperBrony64 up next, but he seems to be hitting some "Zzz's". Which isnt very nice if you ask me, he shouldnt hit them.
I would have played The Simpsons with him too if hadn't pussyed out.
Random Question, Where can i find all adventure time episodes?
Go ahead, call him up...tell he's a little bitch.
him
people tried to make Pearly religious but then I just trolt all over the place and it's hard to sit in a seat for a while,,, play play and play and have fun...
We're about to go pony fabulous on this stream
but the singing is nice though
I'll give you a hint Metronome, "Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free, you are a pirate!"
And then we cream on this bitch! *squee*
KlumzeeDragon: You shouldn't hit sacks either, but people do that all the time, too. =/

Oh Pearly just wanted to say hi to you EspyLacopa
and give you tea and cookies
Mmm cookies
'cause there's no better tea and cookies quite like cybernetic tea and cookies
If I could have ANY food ever... I would have a Jaffa Cake... I could have chosen ANY food ever and I chose a Jaffa Cake...
Does it come with a free goauld symbiote?
I would have one of those "The Lot" burgers, replace the buns with hash browns and add a whole layer of salt inbetween.
Chocolate cookies :3
At least it isn't a deep fried krispy kreme donut.
Oh and deep fried afterward :P
I once had a deep fried mars mar... *frool*
*drool
Then pour gravy over the damn greasey thing
and more gravy... and more gravy...
THEN DEEP FRIED AGAIN
Can you do that?
Fry something twice?
We need more MMMM like episode where Pinkie describes more food porn :Q
There was a burger that literally had heaps of meat and bacon on it and the buns where glazed krispy creme donuts.
<adSurge Ellipsis
For heart killing: Deep Fried Butter.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY SPELLING TONIGHT!

Don't hug me... I'm scared...

No streamers or anything?
Nope :/
Everyone's doing their thing
nope mods are gone
Aww
taco party
He still sick?
Vivix: he's trying to get some sleep now
ah, yeah- good for him
being sick sucks
Aye
I only get galactic colds that last 3-4 days but leave my nose devastated :D
My name is John Martson.
I'm here to kill Bill Williamson
Wut
I rode in a gang...we robbed people. I left the ganag after the gand left me...
People don't forget...nothing is forgiven.
I don't know which movie/game you're quoting... :(
RED DEAD REDEMPTION
Ah
My first thought was Clockwork Orange, but that works too. =P
I don't play many games like that
What do you think of Infamous? :D
If I don't capture my brother in arms...great harm will befall my family.
has anone played dishonored>
DUTCH ALWAYS SAID YOU WERE AN ARROGANT SON OF A BITCH MARTSON!!! :[
Dishonored isn't out yet, isn't it?
Marston...this is a land of opportunity....
10.09.2012<--- Dishonored release date
Sheriff Jonson: It's gonna be one hell of a bloody job.
I don't know any other kind.
hmm wonder why steam isnt doing a 10% discount or buy 3 get 1 free ?
Yes you...are the Bounty Hunter yes?
OMG...hold up I'll be back.
They said red dead would come on the computer, I haven't seen it yet
I played it on PS3 and adored it though
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
stop eeeet
Never L3
:3
whaat ?
/me ships Jmo and Vivix
That'd be something.
/me is in a shipping crate, shipping all over
hehe
oh crap and the shipping begins
Ship everyone with everything!
anyone into my little pony: roleplaying is magic?
What is that? A game or just general rp?
http://www.mlprim.com/s2e/
God my day is just meh
Chat is quiet........ Random Earrape video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20K0AWm2Vug
Ohh, Pen and paper?
Metronome, OH JESUS WHY
Metronome Ear rape videos are not allowed, Even when there is no stream
It counts as a screamer
Oh
Roleplaying is magic
OK:S
Ooh, tabletop. I've always wanted to try that!
Brb, restart chrome. Skype installed its click to call thing despite me saying NO
Metronome Just warning ya bud
I have nobody to play with tho. =/
ok i get it D:<
Gold_Demona: you have us
RoboGerbil: You can do tabletop over the internet? O_o
You can
of course
DnD has a RP client that's really cool
RPTools
Metronome I'm gonna boop your nose
/me is a tabletop newb and has no idea how any of it works, but wants to try it anyway
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
you can probably play tabletop ponies with RPTools
YARR ME HEARTIES
yarr! We be poirits!
Yarrrr!
Gold_Demona: same
f tools, just use your imagination like a real rper
I used to play tabletop DnD with my cousin, really fun
Well the tools are just a chat thing
Gold_Demona: sounds really fun
It seems like a really fun social activity. I'm not big on social things, but I think I can really get into tabletop RP
where the gamemaster can keep all the stats and information, and change his name and whisper easily
id use skype so we can talk rather than type
Talking gamemaster is best gamemaster
gamemaster maakes the game though, if he's boring and says things like "oh you rolled a nine, you missed." instead of going..crazy and describing how you missed
yaeh-
Vivix: overly verbose is never boring in a game :D
It'd be an interesting thing to do.
hehehe, true. and it's more fun to hear a description than being tolled "you missed." 15 times
told*
I'd probably be back-stabbing Vivix everytime I get the chance.
:>
;__; bastard
I LOVE YOU TOO.
lol
what's fun with PNP is that you can do anything you want, gamemaster just has to interpret it into the rules
but in pony rp, combat is rare anyway
PNP?
yeah-
pen and paper
Oh
like- that's what I always loved, you could do anything. Like grab some guys chemistry set and throw it all in a bucket to see what happens. The GM just has to--do his thang and make it cool
and if i ran it, id ad lib most of it. let the players describe the setting
yeah, it's a very fun and social game
yeah, fun, heh.
http://derpy.me/zofvO This is what I was talking about.
/me back-stabs Vivix
ADVENTUUUUUUUUUURE~
it's best if everyon stays in character and stuff-
Damn, you fiend!
Suck it up and roll for a healing spell.
Vivix: also keep some flexibility to the players' choices and punish jackasses who are actively griefing :D
yeah
Anyone? http://derpy.me/zofvO
red dead trailer, aw yeah
our gm would constantly roll dice, like all the time, so that we never knew when he did it to check things
This is just reminding me of the DnD Community episode.

Dear lord >_>
hi everyone :)

Hello Lil_B
Hi Lil_B

Lil_B I come and go with what i say, But i constantly keep my little eye out
I would, if Vivix was coming along.
RoboGerbil: Me too
Maybe, depending on the wheres and hows
I'd - being the nervewreck I am - prefer text, but yeah
damn box!
wheres and hows is skype
Vivix, suck it up.
;__;
I'd be like a minion sitting on Vivixs shoulder.
You could be a tiny little 'Spike' or Gummy
Something like that.
Gummy would be best, you could bite all you want
you can be a pony or dragon
No alligators? That's racist.
;~;
hehe
can have a pet
Well, you wouldn't be able to talk
I do what I want fewl >.>
Don't make me get out the trout again

Apparently HydraIRC does not save my connection or favourites, so I had to look it up again
I think I am in the bronystate steam group, the..movienight group?
:O you got an interesting name Gold_Demona
No I am in the open group- not invite only
Demona... Is that short for Desdemona?
AdamTheDuck: Nope. Demona as in the one from Gargoyles.
I've used this name for literally over 15 years. I'm kinda stuck with it cuz all my online friends know me by this name. =P
Aha, never watched Gargoyles but I knew it! :D
oooh! new rainbow dash presents
Did I miss the dead hours?
RoboGerbil: could u send a link plz?
I wonder why Steam is showing me as offline... Odd.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYYyMH1qSAA&feature=player_embedded
RoboGerbil: thx :3
Gold_Demona: Because Gabe Newell.
And then, stream was a zombie.
chat* goddammit
as nopony invites luna!
nemnemnem
chat is super calm since mods are sleeping
/me nomths Vivix
/me bites Jmo's tongue
;~;
I love it when chat is calm.
It's kinda nice, yeah
Me too
Nothing's on fire
mods are like the enforcers here...without rules life is boring
/me sets Vivix on fire
We didn't start the fire.
I BEG TO DIFFER.
I usually zone out when it starts filling up by night
!
Ditto.
/me puts on some Aquatic Ambience from Donkey Kong Country to make to match teh calm chat
/me puts on Strobe.
/me puts on som yo la tengo the sounds of sounds of science ambience jam
/me puts on Vivix
/me is a fantastic record
our we streaming!!
Stream is dead, Dave.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaSbBKa3sSw
noooooo
Nope. No stream. Just us chickens
Vivix: Yay post rock music
Hehe
Yo La Tengo is one of my favourite alterna bands-
I could post some rocki'er stuff if someone wants
/me clucks
Aha! I found the setting! Steam should show me as online now. :3
Noooo, this is good :3
Mods are alseep.
Post videos.
:3
I'll post a few of mine :3
On FimFiction me and Halycon Android have put out like- 50 links, and 2 pages of discussion, mostly ambient rock and synth stuff, and alternative etc
in the music forum
Like A Boss, Lil_B :D
Mods are asleep, post humans!
MadSurge Like a goddamn Boss XD
I like synth. And alternative. And ambient. And classic. Everything, basically.
I like most things, but my heart is alternative I think
This one gives a strong feeling for some reason, I like it :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUs-35E2dW0
/me listens
Sounds kinda like Mogwai and Mono child in the intro
Voocals!
But very soft vocals
I loove them
Ikr :3
I adore soft and shaky vocals
/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
/me favs and decides to hunt in recordshop
/me has been slap so many times by large trouts
Codeine and Low also fall into this category, but--different setting and instrumentation, heard them?
hello everypony
quiet today?
Hiya BronyInstrumental
yeah
Ohai there BronyInstrumental
/me hugs AdamTheDuck as thanks for link
Always a pleasure. :)
hi BronyInstrumental
i haven't played tekkit in a while
ohai BronyInstrumental
http://youtu.be/J_r0N_ZPhDE Saw this band a few weeks ago? or something, fell in love with this song, a bit long though
Live it was just a punch in the heart
let's do some random games. look to your left, the first thing you see is your cutie mark. what is your talent?
Sheetmusic, writing compositions
Emptying bowls that had previously contained cereal
Guitar, playing guitar
BronyInstrumental: Damn, a buffer bar is my cutie mark :D
Empty cereal bowl
AdamTheDuck: your special talent is now buffering, congratulations
*Yay*
I'm actually surrounded by instruments atm
my scool bag is my cutie mark... or my chair
If you want DIRECTLY to my left, it's my crochet box
i'm surrounded by all sorts of performing arts crap, like easels and canvases and musical instruments, etc
I could live with that. A crochet cutie mark
are you a gearhead?
gearhead?
like- love instruments and amplifiers and pedals- just in itself?
i don't think i catch your drift......
like- collect guitar amps or something
no, i don't collect them
I want to- but money
i just have 1 of everything i need, as of yet
I've got.. 4 amps I think
although it's gonna cost me a lot for my bass
and i've only got 1 amp that's not powerful enough for a bass, so i'll need a bigger one
Ahh, what you looking at there?
yeah
hey everybrony
Hiya
Hi HiImSpike

Heya everypony
and hiya HiImSpike
hey AdamTheDuck
hi TheMonstaMuffin
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_qp6Z7BmA I don't know, I really like the lyrics, no matter how pessimistic it may be.
hey BronyInstrumental
Looks pretty neat
Hiyo HiImSpike
hi TheMonstaMuffin
I've got.. 8 basses I think <,<
and hi HiImSpike
hello Lil_B and Gold_Demona
I kinda want something with that pickup, after hearing Blur
Hi everyone who came simultaneously on with me
Vivix: damn you and your legal employment >.>
hehehe
Years of saving money and being poor
Hello TheMonstaMuffin
Vivix can you hold all your Basses or do you drop them regulary... and how awfuly was my pun?
Vivix: years of being too young to get my ass a job....anywhere
And Hi BronyInstrumental, AdamTheDuck and Lil_B
That pun, aah. Yeah I broke my bass neck once, and crushed a few jacks
Aah yeah-
I got my first bass when I was..14, Fender precision from my cousin, used and beaten up. And then I didn't get anymore until I was 19 or 20
i've been getting money by dogsitting. not hard work, but it's slow cash. good enough for me, at any rate
I came on because a fellow brony added me on steam and said he was on Bronystate ;)
TheMonstaMuffin: oh rly? who was it?
income is good, even if it is low
TheMonstaMuffin Ah so you are new to BS?
Vivix: i got my first guitar for my 14th birthday, which was July this year
Killerpony7733 No! no no no i've been here A LOT
Ah nice, what guitar is it?
Vivix: SG, special edition :3
TheMonstaMuffin Welp forgive me, I just don't always remember names
Ah nice
I want an SG too-
Bronyinstrumental I dont know what his BS name is >.<
http://derpy.me/PPYvc
my dad has one of the few remaining les pauls, me want! >.<
I want a really cheap Les Paul, take off the neck and put on a jazzmaster neck and vintage mics
killerpony7733 No worries! I can't even remember any one from my fammily's birthday
Ah hehe, yeah. They're nice things
BronyInstrumental Going to turn 18 by during next month and my parents are going to give me a pretty ok amount of money along with childhood savings they have been building up
Vivix: he has one of the ORIGINALS, it was second hand when he got it (30 years ago) so it's pretty sick
Niice, yeah
BronyInstrumental It seems he is HiImSpike
The odlest instrument I have is a 1960s Norwegian steel string accoustic- 100 bucks ish, but really neat sound
I remember that guy
killerpony7733: well happy birthday in advance :)
my sister has a strat. how boring is she? everyone has a strat :3
BronyInstrumental thanks i guess, But yeah i will have so much money i don't know what to do with. Probably gonna save most of it and maybe take a trip to somewhere
hehe
killerpony7733 The same as BronyInstrumental said! xD
I want a beaten strat, for that midneck sound, but I-- they're so booring to look at
I save most of my money since I don't drink or smoke or anything, so even with my low income I suddenly have much money
TheMonstaMuffin Yep thanks, Gonna be something to turn 18
killerpony7733: how r you
Vivix No drinking! :O
Vivix aww
i don't drink, smoke, drive, buy food, i pretty much have all my cash to myself
I'm back!
BronyInstrumental: Yeah I know the feeling
BronyInstrumental You are the perfect human! Im not ideal on that part :)
hey sp!!!:)
I got- of guitars: SX Telecaster with Seymour mics, Ibanez SAS(wut), Hofner Galaxie repro, Behringer smashed to pieces Sonic Youth guitar, unnamed guitar for weird tunings and drumstick use, and I think that's it
HiImSpike Not my best day, Slept for 7 hours or so woke up with litterally no energy and wen't to school for two lessons asked if i could go home. And then i took a 1 and amybe a half hour nap at home.
maybe*
/me hugs killerpony7733
/me hugs back AdamTheDuck
what we wathching
Hugs always make people feel better :3
Vivix: i wish i knew what those were, sorry, i have little knowledge of the guitar world, i just know what feels familiar, I.E. the guitar's i've been learning with
fluttermac: No stream at the moment sadly
AdamTheDuck Ehh depends, I have not gotten a real serious hug for years
Anyone saw Alexxm, CCCP or Ninjazz today?
Vivix: and believe me, i tried a LOT of guitars, and SGs just sound right for me
yeah, telecaster is pretty standard, but I love it. I am a guitar lover- I really want jazzmaster, jaguar, mustang- Fender VI would be a dream come true, but yeah- all a bit obscure
hehe, yeah
killerpony7733: I give out free hugs to people at school, everyone thinks I'm insane :D
nope
AdamTheDuck Heh that's you i guess then. But yeah not the case for me :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AHHOTDzWuM&feature=related
Vivix: like, i tried out a dot, a strat, a lousille (BB King), les paul, and the SG just sounded the best for me
derp face for canadins
Oh.
Yeah, it is very individual. I want a SG for fuzzed out noise, but I prefer twangy vintage sounds, so I lean to the european and fender brands
lolololololollololololololol
/me finds dreamguitar
:[
if only my SG were vintage, it's special edition, but it's epiphone, not gibson :<
http://cdn1.gbase.com/usercontent/gear/3057451/p1_uhz0bnjpy_so.jpg this is one of my dreamguitars
my dad has a vintage strat, a fender one, not squire, and he won't let me use it cause he thinks i'll break it :D
Aah, Epiphone is pretty good for their price though
Aaw
I love vintage guitars and amps, I was saving up for a 1978 Gibson RD Bass, but it sold the day I decided I had enough money-
The other seller refused to ship outside of USA
byy
Vivix: :<
I also like Teisco and unbranded japanese 60's instruments- crazy cheap and wonky sound
my dad doesn't want me to buy a bass, cause he thinks bass is for people that can't play 6 string ones. but too f*cking bad for him
http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4463327534_60b6735e98_o.jpg I mean look at this, Musima Eterna, DDR Guitar from the 60s-70s
Aah, that's mean
pretty slick, Vivix
Bass is my love, like my main instrument, but guitar is a fun and great way to express aswell
mfw SpilldotCom discussed Bronies and I wasn't privy on it,
i'm fully proficient in bass, and semi-proficient in guitar (can't do lead, only rhythm)
You could buy a Fender VI, or Gibson EB-6, six stringed basses from the 60s, with 30" necks and thin profile
I'm proficient, but I can't say I'm fully proficient in bass
Like- billy sheehan or- that Chick Corea or what'shisname guy
well, i say "fully proficient", i mean i can play just about anything that's put in front of me, with a little time and practise
yeah
Im off guys ;)
cya
I'm pretty good at reading fast, but I tend to jam along on first try, great exercise in playing with others is to play songs you don't know
Bye TheMonstaMuffin
Bye :)
Byye
Vivix: yeah, i'm actually taking a class in school this year like that. playing songs and learning songs you've never heard before, with other people
Yeah, it's a lot of fun. My eh "major" (english, waat) in Community College was improvisation for stage
the guitarist next to me sometimes played with chains and hammer on his guitar
heurgh, more people that have finished college when i haven't even started it yet. i feel young -_-"
I feel old. I haven't done any school in over six years
Hehe, it was a one year college, no--degree, you only had to send in demo of your music and be over 18
admission there was automatically approved for audition for LIPA though- but I didn't try
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2vPgIhYp20 , 'cause there's no stream :3
ok ill see you all again soon! Bye for now ;)
byee
Bye DerpDash
after school when i get a job i'm immediately looking into Drum lessons, then Cello lessons, because i took 1 random lesson in both of them and i kinda wanna finish them
bye derpd- oh, they're gone
/me wished he learnt how to play the Cello at school :(
/me also wants to learn Cello
/me still could, if he had the cash
/me just came here and he wants to play cello as well.
/me welcomes Malavolent
Ohai Malavolent
The only lessons I've had was during that college year
Great teacher, focused mainly on holding beat and improvising-
the lessons i took were during what my school calls "opportunities days", basically; do random bullshit for 5 hours, for 3 days
my dam internet
I would love drumlessons, or something, I've only played that for lulz, but oh god it is fun
and one of those happened to be a cello lesson
aah
AdamTheDuck, chill, and sweet voice
/me <3 Marble Sounds :P
and also learning to write chinese, which didn't help me through anything at all

"It's NOT. SPONGEBOB."
Sumica: What are you talking about? The show was cancelled after the movie.
yes, spongebob has gone a very horrible route

PillowPoni, nonsense just stay here while we grab your tits like you sai.d Lol. :)

Pool noodles aren't that floaty.

13but will it blend
Lol! :D
Ew, banana.
I used to watch Lyoko now and again, right after school, it wasn't bad, but I never caught enouh episodes in a row to get the story
Sumica it says on Wiki they re-used many animations for talking and run cycles because they had a tight budget. Later they got more money and got better animation. So I can see why Season 1 may have been lacking in the beginning.
me too i thought code lyoko was good
Code Lyoko is great who said it was bad?
hi everypony
O never really got into Code Lyoko :/
Code Lyoko was meh...
Hallo somepony_else

hi MLP_Brovakiin and Ponies47

Ponies47, go watch it already damn you.

Apple + Potato = German bluray Steelbook
Uuugh
you'd be able to feel the textures
you stupid little bastards

I'd take the peel off the apple before handing it
I duuurt knuur
Buytoast: you never treid that, did you?
YEah, lol
/me hugs Gold_Demona
Buytoast: it'S surprisingly impossible
Mooooo.
BONK
of course i've done the whole hold your nose while you eat
Woof!
Wishbone!
but you'd be able to tell the textures
Are you rea- WOOF!
especially if the apple's skin is still on
yeah, but if you remove the apple skin, then you have a wet apple inside, but the potato is still dry
it negates the test
what is this about a skin?
13hm
I've eaten a lot of raw potatoes
13oh i see the audio derp is VAC
it's almost same texture- not quite
oh fuck get godzilla
All dem sound effects :S
I'm not sure what potatoes you handle, but anytime I cut potatoes, they're juicy like apples
Gold_Demona - well, not *as* juicy
A fish, fly, or Bill!
Maybe the apples are by Applejack.
Juicy enough that you'd have to be pretty damn observant with your sense of touch to tell the difference
Sharks are cool.
I like apples

It's more irregular to show up at the office in a one-piece.
00,10the same
13like if the sentence ended on "from his point of view" or something
00,10my guess is it's a suttle lost in translation

Best Night Ever is on the Hub right noooooow :D:D:D
I'm in a bit of a sour mood for I have to go my high school tomorrow for freshman only day. It's going to take me FOREVER to fall asleep tonigh
Ponies47: Hope it goes well.:)
Ponies47: FRESHMAAAAAAAN. But seriously, the first day is always the most nerve racking. I think you'll do just fine.
Ponies47 bring new clothes along
Ponies47: Forget the impossibility of getting to sleep, just think of the impossibility of waking up to your alarm clock.
I find the first day of school the best day of school.
AJIsAwesome: Pfffft. Buck that. It's gonna suck. I know it will.
Ponies47: It will only suck if you believe it to be that way.
LadyCanary: Well it's just the freshman nobody else. Just freshman
Go in with stride.
This is amazing. ._.
Everlasting_Joy: Ugh
Buck yeah
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Why? O.O
HAY GUYS
Flootahshy: Hello!
XD Dat face.
Ponies47 i thought it would be like in my school, but if its only freshmans you'll be safe
Dramatic prarie dog.
....YESSSSSSSS.
What'sa goin on here?
Gits?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Ah. Ok. :P
the first day for freshmans is nothing... now the first friday for freshmans well... just make sure you're not walking home...
Flootahshy: Ghost in the Shell.
My school sucks.
I've been trying to sing this FOR AGES. ;3;
LadyCanary: How's it coming along?
But it's really hard.
Spectrum_Rush: Freashmen can't walk home, they stagger home on Fridays
Everyone in my school is an imbecile.
Poofing, huh? That's always fun.
It proves to be very hard. Many pitch chages, and it's difficult for me to hit such high notes.
I go to a community college, I am afraid I am smarter than some of my teachers
Wait....are we actually watching an episode?
:O
wat really?
Oh yeah becasue it will be my first day and high school and I will have no friends what so ever. NO PONY STUFF OR TALKING ABOUT PONIES ALLOW. I can handle that *Eye twitchs* O_O
/me hugs LadyCanary
Ponies47: Pony stuff isn't allowed?
Ponies47: So? You have us, and you'll only be in school for a few hours.
Ponies47: Is your school in Korea?
Well, that's how you start as a freshman, Ponies47. No friends, until you talk to someone. And when you're comfortable to bring up ponies, then do so.
/me nomths Vivix
00,10celing tachikoma is watching you smooze
So, this is the famour Ghost in the Shell... I think I'll hang around.
/me sucks Jmo's face
AJIsAwesome: Well I got no friends and such so me being a brony cannot be told until I have friends and such :/
Well that's something.
Everlasting_Joy: True :P
GilDash: the movie is better
Personally I find making friends in school to be a waste of time. Friends are annoying.
Ponies47: I would follow LadyCanary's advice.
Well, Imma head out for today. See ya tomorrow, Bronystate.
DaringDerpy: I've honestly no idea. In terms of anime, I've literally no knowledge whatsoever.
Baai Gold_Demona
Gold_Demona: Bye!
Sumica Tachi? wait...
Take care Gold_Demona!
Hey, Sumica, do you like Big O?

13see i'm not sure where this guy fits in
"ba ba ba, ba bababa, ba"
00,10yeah LadyCanary
GilDash: you can trust me on this :)
Ever consider streaming it one day? If not, thats alright.
Ponies47, Ihad no friends when I entered college thing, what saved me was that I have a sticker on my bass that one of the guys recognized and was liek "HEY DUDE! I LOVE THAT BAND"
foot in the doooor
00,10would need to find eps first
DaringDerpy: Okay, I will. Until then though, I'll just have to do with what's on stream. :)

Vivix, what were you referring to with the baba?
13just look at her shoulders genius
Gotcha.

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Core of the Apple / CMC Pokemon / Makes Me Wonder
LadyCanary: Good advice. That my take a while but at the end of the year I'm going to wear a TON of pony stuff to school. :P
Jmo, the mouth animation on the stream
*may
I went with my RD T-Shirt to school, appearently they were weirded out that they saw a Pixeled-Pony with a Rainbow, but they didn't question it further
Oh right Vivix.
Vivix: I see
wat
A small hint is enough to make--people reach out, you know? I would have never reached ou to him, but he did to me
and when I knew him, via him I got to know other people, and was able to go to the cantene without--hiding under tables and shit
LadyCanary: You beat me to the punch :).
13hi folks!
Pawnch.
You like to poof, don't you?
Oh man, this episode.
LadyCanary: I'm not goign to wear any pony stuff at all! Not even my wristband for it says Brony and RD right on the thing.
*Robotnik.
And has RD on it*
PINGAS
I don't want to be a robot in the future.
^
that ugy has no eyes
Fun Fact: I watched every episode of that Sonic Cartoon and I liked it O_O
Ponies47: which one
Yeah, being a robot in present gives you more advantages
What one? SatAM or Adventures?
whats that?
echo
Spectrum_Rush: The Adventures of Sonic The Hedgehog :$
..echo.. echooo
Ponies47: Same here.
POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF
Media vultures.
13nice shot
MY LEG!
I like the NC Review of this Sonic Cartoon, one of his earliest and one of my favourite
Who was that guy? Was he a hobo?
MY OTHER LEG!
A lot of people hate that cartoon just because it isn't SATam, but that's because it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be cartoonish and over-the-top, which is why I likt it.
?
SirGanjalf: My leg!
LadyCanary: I'll take that advice very well. I don't like it when a huge croud of people are looking at me. It scares me :S
That guy from Spongebob: My leg!!
I like both SATam and AOSTH equally.
I think Spectrum_Rush is speechless now
Or he's writing a book
"Someone got shot! Get the cameras!"
JG,HF KJHFMJGF JHFJMHFK J
I dunno
Spectrum is fancy. He's writing a novel.
Ponies47 is should go well if you follow LadyCanary advice, I didn't mention to my classmates that I watch that show for over a year now, exept close friends and them I told to not spread it
Very close to real life, Vivix. XD
why am i speechless? Ponies47
yeap
lol
Steam powered robot?
woah
what..the voice
Lil_B: Okie doki loki!
How quaint.
Spectrum_Rush: That funfact before.
Ponies47 and try not not eccedently quote the show XD
SirGanjalf, steam-ejecting arm. Maybe it's neumatic.
No. It's just magic smoke.

Lil_B: That's impossible for me. I seem to do that. ALOT :$
Yeah, so why are you not laughinh?
I sense use of drugs.
*laughing
Ponies47 well... I think "eeyup" is tolerable, but don't give someone a brofist saying "Brohoof" XD
HIYA everypony
Okay everpony! We don't need to hoof out advice!

Hey Bronysith!
Bronysith: Hello!
oh god Bronysith D:
Lil_B: Oh God. I know that's gonna happen some day. Somebody holds ther fist and I saw "BROHOOF! Um.. I mean BROFIST" and then he gives me WTF look :$
Hey Bronysith
Ponies47 XD
Spin a long tale about how you were born with hooves, claiming that's why

"I have been woeking on a Ranch latly and thats how we greet the horses... >_> "
Lil_B: I just know that's goign to happen someday. I just know it!
Is it good or bad that I'm following what's going on despite only having watched half of the last episode and this one and never seen this show before?

They're aliens, not Smurfs

Okay, they're not aliens. They're the natives of another planet

It's a strict nono to post other chans

Fantasia was an animation experiment based on german folk tales and modern animation techniques. Like bambi and the other great 5 they were all made around 1940
777777
-_^
Pilgrims!
Fantasia was supposed to be a running series of experiments, but it never happened. Also, the tales were childrens tales, if I remember correctly, and most old chidlrenstales are HORRIFYING
00,10was lucky and got to see this in theaders when they re-released it back in the late 80's
I wasn't even alive then

Yes, the conductor said it would end with Ave Maria
AJ and Flutter approves
what movie is this?
AJIsAwesome: No... in the original she intended to eat them... but they freaking baked her. Almost casually.
And in Cinderella, the sisters cut off ther toes so that they could fit their feet into the glass shoe.

Notre Dam was horrible as well, he kidnapped the lady- and- yeah the novelle is horrible
Man I feel old. And I'm fucking 16!

Very very much longer, yeah- the inbetweening and colouring- I have no idea how many cells was in this movie, but -- one simpsons episode was..3500 cells? and that's cheap and 22 minutes
Cleo! :D
/me join dashiesauce
were*
h+ohe0rhjperjghp¨wejg
elo CrazyCherry, and seems you put in a wrong command
08,01also, Fantasia doesn't have felt.
I think I hear an oboe
08,01or Pinkie Pie, for that matter
darn
what is this?
08,01Tovler: it's actually a cor anglais, i think
I like Pinkie Pie
Dovah Fantasia
08,01hey guys, why's a cor anglais called a cor anglais?
dunno
08,01because when anglais saw it, he went "cor!"
Rando Movie Trivia: Fantasia didn't made money for Disney on it's first release in 1940, but it made much money when it god re-released in the 60's as a "Trip Movie"
cause its an angelic choir?
yeah, Bambi also flopped the premiere
which is INSANE to think about
Dah, english horn would have been my second guess.
08,01Vivix|Woops: actually, cor is short for cornet, which means trumpet or horn
08,01and anglais is english
Lil_B: I can understand why:D
Ooh, yes-
08,01so it's literally the english horn
RUSSIAN DANCER FLOWERS
I take it most of the songs are from tchaikovskys
/me remembers fighting Dream Eaters w/ this in the BG
08,01which reminds me of a Flanders and Swann joke
seems legit
Dken2021: I think this part of the movie is entirely a Tchaikovsky homage.
wouldn't doubt it
a know i've never avctually seen russians dance like that
Yeah we in Russia have dancing flowers
HELOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BRONYSTATE
The only double reed instruments I know are: oboe, english horn, and bassoon.
hey Quick_Thinker!
lali-ho Quick_Thinker
<Quick_Thinker> hi
hi Quick_Thinker. Welcome to Fantasia
Fairiesss :3
Quick_Thinker: Hello!
Green fairies? Absinthe included.
i wondered what we were watching
im an artistist
Fantasia
I LOVE FANTASIA :D
08,01"to this end, I have been practicing the French Horn, as they call it, or the German Horn, as the French call it; not to be confused, of course, with the Cor Anglais"
wow... I can see parts of the stream without reloading constantly... wut is this magic?
did night on bald mountain play yet?
08,01cracks me up every time!
aah Autumn... my favorite season
I can play a recorder . . .
sort of
and a ukelele
sort of
08,01i play the cello
Is this the uncensored Fantasia with the questionable centaur part?
I guess to answer the question to why stuff like this doesn't get animated anymore, everything has to convey a narrative. Even Youtube Poops have stories to them.
08,01Tovler: i think you just missed that
Nah, the centaur skit hasn't played yet.
Animation is- beautiful
08,01DUUUUUH DUUUUUH DUUUUUUUUH DIDDLY DUM DUM
Gah! Why does everybody I know have more talent for musical instruments then me? My friend can play the Sax for crying out loud!
and luckily now in 2012 we are able to animate similar to this on the cheap- but I don't think any cel animators are still alive
How saxy.
XD
08,01epic cello moment
00,10and this is all from befire they had any kind of computeres
most animation is still handdrawn
Tovler: you missed the unicorns/pegasi part
CUE OCTAVIA SOLO
Remember, up until S14 Simpsons was drawn with the exact same techniques as this movie
also i have a new ish idea for a fanfic
Sumica: beautiful isn't it?
08,01Canadian_Brony: well, to be fair, i have more musical talent than most people...
00,10even the editing was all done by hand
im nost making it until i can get some opinions though
Canadian_Brony no worries brah, it's been years since I touched a percussion instrument, and I probably suck at them now
So, Fantasia isn't being played straight through?
00,10no Tovler
00,10just clips that I can find
Autumn!
so some Fantasia 2000 stuff might play?
Nope, winter <3
And Winter!
I have huge amount of respect for the colour ladies and men, and the inbetweeners-
Hnnnnnng so gorgeous
i wonder if you could do a PMV of this if you pulled it off right
Quick_Thinker ........ doubt it
LadyCanary: let's be thankful for this masterpiece :)
I'm just happy that I can recognize instrument sounds.
It would just not be as cool as the original
Oh, snap... Lauren Faust and Walt Disney working together. Terrifying and glorious.
I guess the Fantasia thing with the dinosaurs is too long
Quick_Thinker: request accepted!
08,01rite of spring! rite of spring! rite of spring!
?
08,01Sumica: yup!
oh the steam thing :)
Yep
08,01okay, so i need to tell you all the story about The Rite of Spring
Is that a Bassoon?
yay another friend to add to the list
08,01Tovler: it is!
08,01Tovler: playing at the very top of its register
00,10sorry found a better one
08,01so the Rite of Spring is the piece of music that's playing behind this
08,01Sumica: aye, i thought the pitch was off
and i have a new idea that may or may not work for fic. Anypony here play ARMA 2 (not Day Z ARMA 2)
ohai Wrek
Wow, 1940 :O
now it definitely sounds like a Bassoon
08,01Sumica: it starts on a C, but that other video sounded like it started on a C#
Vivaldi's Winter?
00,10this is also the full bit
00,1022min long
00,10other was only 7
I can't tell most clarinets apart.
galaxy
english horn?
Oh god, is this the dinosaur one?
i think octavia is timing it prett well :)
ooh now I remeber this piece
/me yawns.
just wait
/me falls alseep
00,10yes MadSurge
My yawn is super effective!
This is already better than Tree of Life.
Sumica: this is much scarier than Chernabog
damnit jiggly puff *snore*
whoa, big time skip
*yells in Quick_Thinker 's ear* SCIENCE!!!1!!!1!!
08,01anyhoos, so Stravinsky is the composer of this. He was a Russian composer in the early 20th Century
oh i love the dinosaur one
08,01i regard him as really the remnants of the impressionist
HISTORY
The burning galaxy part was skipped for me
08,01but feel free to disagree with me
Quick_Thinker awake now?
yep
good
wait nope nvm :l
ok im muting it
08,01anyhoos, as you can here, this piece is quite striking in its dissonance
or at least 50% it
08,01this was somethign that audiences of the time were really not used to
While the nice music plays, I'll go make food, so I has noms to enjoy while watching.
Dissonance <3
what's this?
08,01MadSurge: of course!
fantasia
XylemTube: Fantasia
08,01in fact, this is possibly my favourite piece of orchestral music of all time
hi XylemTube. Fantasia. "Rite of Spring" IIRC
or somethin' like that
00,10I like this part
Clips from Fantasia, at the least.
clips from fantasia to be exact, not the whole thing
08,01so The Rite of Spring was oriignally conceived as a ballet
this was a ballet?
08,01it tells basically the story of Beltane, but as told in the Russian folk mythos
I'm not very familiar with classical music, but I kinda like stravisnky, and what I heard described about him, how he wanted a sharp mechanical sound at times-
volcanoes?
in a ballet?
dude now im starting to remember all the music and cool scene i saw in this movie as a kid
I need to get out more
so bad bass
08,01it's the beginning of spring, and there are elders who are performing this Rite
08,01and it culminates in a virgin dancing herself to death as a sacrifice
08,01anyhoos
00,10this must have been a bitch to get the tieming set
^
^^
so much Bassoon in this piece.
Morning all.
hi XAX
and there went earth
Hey XAX!
This is rather like 2001, but animated in this clip.
evening XAXy
hi XAX
08,01so this was a ballet, and it was choreographed by Vaslav Nijinkski
Skipping spring. Going straight to geological summer
08,01who was also quite a revolutionary artistic figure of the time, in the field of dance
XAX: Hello!
And then the earth died.
08,01the choreography he made for the piece was equally striking, especially to audiences of that time
Dat primordial earth
Tovler: no ... then the earth lived
08,01it featured scantily clad young women dancing in jutting, fierce movements
Spectrum_Rush: proof?
<.<
08,01bear in mind that this premiere took place in France in 1913
water we watching
keep watching, Tovler and you'll see.
Tovler you're living on it
-.o so much lag.
08,01the audiences were confused, outraged, and angry at it
cowvarkian "Fantasia"
cowvarkian: Fantasia.
oh cool
08,01so much so, in fact, that halfway through the performance, a riot broke out in the auditorium
08,01an actual riot
There needs to be a 20 min PMV of this
1913 AND THEY WERE ANGRY AT IT FUCK THEM
Hehe
seriously this is a master piece
Wait, we're watching Fantasia? The Disney movie?
Things take time
08,01this drove Stravinsky into a depression
Well, they didn't like that sort of choreography.
Of the impressionist, I only really know Arne Nordheim
XAX clips from it, yes
XAX: parts of it, yes
08,01thogugh later, the piece was better received
1913 man i thought anmanition started in the time before WWII not that far back
:o
00,10spore, the animation
i mean wow
1913 is the music, the naimation is 1940
spore before spore
If those 1913 people thought they were mad, I hate to imagine how they reacted to jazz.
08,01anyhoos, this piece contains many references, allusiions, and paraphrases of Russian folk music
1940 okay thats still amazing
hey guys, just got done installing guild wars 2 and now my charr needs a name. any ideas?
cowvarkian yeah. We're also watching it
mc hoofer
Dark_Horst: Slate Fistcrunch.
Quick_Thinker: Oh, the music was done much before the animation. At least, the animation we see here.
oh, cool
btw, charr is the race, nto a typo
DaringDerpy: Big Mclargehuge
ikr
Meanwhile: imma try that
tab fail
08,01stravinsky was trying to awaken the nacent "folk memory" of russian past; i consider this a very nationalistic piece
Sealife! :3
Tovler: now are you seeing... that violent displace wasnt the death of the world... it was its birth
08,01again, feel free to disagree with me
mr mc hoofer doo
Yeah tab fail. Roll Fizzlebeef.
stop doing that
I know way too little about classical music
I can't argue with something I know nothing about
08,01but much as the piece is about the awakening of the earth, and the Rite which brings this forth, Stravinsky was reaching into the past and awakening the forgotten musical history of his homeland
hm, I thought Man-o-wars floated on the surface
ikr Vivix|Woops
man i cant imagine how pissed this made other religions
*nibbles ribs and watches*
I 'aint sayin' nothin' because I don't know jack about what you're talkin' 'bout.
08,01Dken2021: it's funny, because i don't consider this early at all!
08,01this is some of the latest music i'm really interested in
this isnt really early music
well I know this wasn't in the classical era
08,01i consider renaissance and baroque to be early music
well
I consider this to be early music
I like most 1920+, there's very few things I don't like. Harshnoise and stuffi ncluded
08,01Dken2021: aye; this was 2 'eras' after. classical -> romantic -> 20th century
Meanwhile: i think it worked xD
lyre is early music
I feel so young in this conversation
THIEF
Dark_Horst: Score.
Meanwhile: login servers overloaded, though
man i like how big of a risk disney took while making this movie
is this song even 100 years old?
Dark_Horst: As usual.
Tovler next year I think
Tovler almost
99
08,01somewhere, i have a 3,000 essay i wrote on the significance of Russian folk tradition in The Rite of Spring
they could have sccrapped this idea becuase they feared it might fail, but they stuck to thier guns and man did it pay off
O____________O
I so wish Tree of Life was more like this.
08,01i'm not sure i want to link it, though, as i wrote it about 7 years ago, and i disagree with some of what i wrote now
00,10I presume you meen creationisum verses darwinisum Quick_Thinker
most the big movies from Disney around 1940 did fail, but were succesfull later on
yeah Sumica
08,01*3,000 word
Hi everypony :)
allo cachi01|phone

cachi01|phone: Hello!
Herro cachi01|phone!

Sumica: was creationism in existance then?
You guys heard of hearthfire and adventure time videogame?
00,10not sure
ADVENTURE TIME WAHT
Not sure when that term came into use
VIDE
O
If anyone want to hear odd things, look up Arne Nordheim - Solitaire , and Merzbow
NO BUCKIN WAY
08,01anyhoos, i guess the take home thigns from what i said are: Rite of Spring is awesome; Stravinsky is awesome; I know a *lot* about music
GAAAME
08,01well, "classical" music
cachi01|phone yea, and the adventure time exclusives that come with it
I know next to nothing about anything before 1960
I took a 5-page essay on Las Vegas and compromised it into a 5-slide powerpoint presontation which I displayed to my English class.
We need a FiM game before Adventure Time, dammit!
one of these days, I'll look up neo-classical music.
hello everypony, whaddid i miss?
when did the titanic happen, Vivix|Woops
1914?
Hearthfire DLC just let you build houses
08,01Vivix|Woops: i'm the inverse! i know a lot about 1400 - 1960, but not much after
...
BronyInstrumental: Hello! Some Fantasia.
no
And adopt children
1912
a FiM game will probely fail if we give it to hasbro to do
Adventure Time is older though.
cowvarkian: 1912
just saying
I had to condense 7 paragraphs into a 3-minute long presentation
I had art history education abo 1400-1920, but music education only 1920-1999
mmm, ground bread
SirGanjalf: I was testing Vivix|Woops's knowledge
oh

or just vcr, gildash
or something
<.<
cowvarkian: I was about to type a lengthy, sarky reply, but you beat me to the punch. Bravo. :D
and Lil_B and some times vice versa
Quick_Thinker: well, they're like "welp, wasn't me!"
I once took a drum midi track and fed it into a synth, sounded like trance
Got to go, guys. Have a meeting to go to.

There's crocodiles later on if I remember correctly.
Tovler: theirs so many ostriches
its Gummy's birthday
Yep GilDash
Hippopotami are not meant to be this graceful.
crocidiles are funny :3
HI, how was everyponies day today? :)

is it me, or is that really old animation way more carefully done than most of todays animations?
yes
OK-- Walt was NOT smoking his usual cigar when he thought of THIS.
Eli it's not just you
Eli: nope, you're right
00,10older animation had way higher framerates
kinda sad if you think about it
ikr Sumica
NOM
we're at ostriches?
08,01so there's a pisstake of this piece called Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah
öm nom
00,10and animated each frame rather then using inbetween
om
08,01anyone heard of it?
Dken2021 eeyup. Frefresh
http://derpy.me/Oa81w
NOT MY GRAPES
Oh yeah. I remember that, vaguely
08,01it's about a jewish boy writing home to his parents abotu being on camp
we should start doing animations frame by frame again...
08,01it's qutie funny
NOOOOO THE GRAPES
Bronysith d'aww . . .
I thought old naimation still used two's?
animation*
Ello everypony
not the slimest hippo I've seen
hi lowfn
I'mback :)
Hallo lowfn
hi
08,01Vivix: most animation is on twos
hai Lowfn
WB
Each cell should then be two frames, just like modern-
bonjour
... muddah and faddah as in is really gangasta slang german "Mutter" and "Vater" ?
08,01Klumzeedragon: ooo, i've not heard that
dat hippo
Tweening is a manual process in everything except flash rigs, and it is rarely used outside because it looks horribly mechanical
08,01MadSurge: animated on twos means that the animation frame only changes ever second frame of film
sure, Lil_B
whole lota plot in this is my only comment
Lil_B: aka mum & dad
08,01*every
and in most, they alternate the twos, so it looks very fluid even if it would "seem" to be 12 fps
Eli yes, but muddah und faddah is really just words real Hip Hop guys use or some accents
00,10bah no crock bit
08,01RAWRity: the animators don't have to draw as much, and it still gives a very smooth picture
fair enough.
I knew it, Dance of the Hours!
00,10and just because I love this one
Lil_B: hip hop in what society?
08,01Klumzeedragon: sure!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alk26XzDYF4
AGAIN :D
08,01oh, the racist ponies one again
centaurs one?
Lil_B: i'm swiss, remember? and my lil bro doesn't have much else to do than listening to gangsta rap
08,01i'm not too convinced it's racist
Man, proto-MLP was fucking weird.
UNICORNS
Ponies!!!
08,01but yeah
08,01it was banned
Saytr!
Lil_B: german gangsta rap
h fuck, Satyrs. RUN PONIES, BEFORE THEY FUCK YOU
08,01so we have satyrs, do we also have nymphs?
PONY
I don't see what's so racist about this.
08,01GilDash: and wait for the black pegasi
cowvarkian the gangsta kinda society
PEGASI
brb everyone.
SirGanjalf: Oh, now i understand
the black Pegasia
We watching Disney MLP?
Mixed marriages
is this the uncensored one?
08,01GilDash: for the purposes of explanation
Yeah, now I see why they would think this as racist
08,01aye
Well, Disney, LONG before My Little Pony. So it might as well be My Little Horse
08,01eroticism and ponies?
I don't want to know where
sure
08,01WHO'DA THUNK?
Eli I knew that you are Swiss :) I just kinda missinterpreted what you said :(
wait
Aww <3
this is DISNEY?
yeeyup
I was just kidding at that
CrimsonPhoenix: YEP
But really, it's more like My Little Mythological Creature
08,01Kencolt: ah, okay
wait, so this got misinterpreted as racist because the mix raced couple of pegasi treated their white kid better?
I have no comment on this discussion.
Lil_B: are you into german rap?
I'm not sure whats worse... this... or G3
We should totally show Song of the South on here sometime, or the old Propoganda shorts Disney did during WWII
So adorable :3
lowfn, G3
lowfn, THIS? WORSE THAN G3?
ikr RAWRity
lowfn G3. This s adorable
lowfn g3
Kandarihu: G3 has nothing on this
08,01this is absolutely beautifully animated
hmm, wonder if a saytr will show up in season 3, they already got minotaurs and cockatrices

Don't compare this to G3:|
so...what was racist about that...at all?
CrimsonPhoenix: :'(
Nothing, really
Okay... so where was the racism?
So, it's a depiction OF racism that's the problem?
Its just that it was a mixed race couple
CrimsonPhoenix I'm bookmarkin that one
00,10GilDash, black horse and white horse
:O
people saying racism becuase black and white, oh you poor prejudice souls
IS THIS

08,01i wasn't really paying much attention to it, to be honest
Chip and Dale? unless they're Rescue Rangers, I'm not interested.
Hello.
DaringDerpy ahahaha
DaringDerpy: ahahahahaha:D
fun fact on chipmonks only females have short tails
Other fun fact: all cows are female, tv messes this up ALL the tim
e
08,01Sumica: you *have* to show Coal Black!
Cavale: well, this is awkward...
08,01because that most definitely *is* racist
08,01in pretty much every way
Aw, but they're cuuuuuuute RAWRity ;3;
00,10they I should not show it
Coal Black and the Sebben Dwarves
DaringDerpy: dat poor dog :D
08,01but gosh darn, is it funny to laugh at the attitudes of the time
08,01Sumica: it's educational
yay
chip was the one with the black nose right?
Dken2021 beats me
08,01Sumica: i think it's fine, so long as we watch it with a mature attitude, and acknowledge that yes, it is horrifically racist
Its fun to look at antebellum racism.
Tovler: this
08,01i mean, shit, we showed Blazing Saddles at BMN
08,01Canadian_Brony: no, Coal Black
blazing saddles was funny as fuck xD
BronyInstrumental: Now Blazing Saddles we're anti-racist.
Dat Dale :D
oh. Blazing Saddles was funny, and I've never heard of Black Coal
I laugh at older black stereotypes anys because they're outrdated anyway
08,01SirGanjalf: well okay, yes, it was taking the piss out of racists by example
SirGanjalf: what about it? and grammar, please translate
08,01but still, it offended a lot of people
They don't need this much
DED
I'm Shadowlicious.

No, not the bees! Not the bees! AAhhh, they're in my eyes!!
DAT GOOFY SCREAM

EHEHEHEH
Seriously, I HATE Chip and Dale.
when did goofy even get in there?
1940s hollywood dark africa racism. meh, as a kid, I was just happy to see my people in cartoons.
Barbetos|AtWork it's a cartoon
BronyInstrumental: Uh, sorry. I mean "Blazing Saddles" was mocking racist attitude in general.
Tovler at least we were in cartoons
StinkomanFan: they're not very nice in their original shorts, but they got better in Rescue Rangers
Canadian_Brony: so are you applying logic to it then?
Barbetos|AtWork logic? What's logic?
Dken2021: remember when they tried to ban Speedy Gonzales?
08,01heh
08,01nuts.
"boioioioioing"
SirGanjalf: i know, it's funny but my dad thinks they wer ebeing serious so he showed it to me when i was 12 to try to get me to believe the stuff they say, cause he's a prick like that
I love RR
spittake
were*
being*
Tovler: but mexicans loved Speedy Gonzales! :D
The best thing about Rescue Rangers was Gadget.
BronyInstrumental: :D
army trumpet
funny fact about chip and dale: germans called them squirrel A and squirrel B
Gadget was besty
best
I LOVE Dr.Dissonance
Kencolt: Rescue Rangers was one of my fav childhood cartoon :$
in russia, there's a cult who built a religion around gadget hackwrench
scary stuff
There's also a flanders cult
MadSurge: ikr? I'm thinking hollywood was ultra PC in the late 90s
not serious, obviously, but still, funny
Eli yeah... at the begining they were just "A Hörnchen" and "B Hörnchen" XD and later... man what were their names >.<
for a time there were no guns in cartoons
hence batman
Lil_B: chip and chap
08,01Lil_B: hehehe, Hoernchen
I still think guns in cartoon is bad thing unless it's teen, but yeah
NOT THE EGGS DALE
Eli yes!
/me 08,01nuzzles Lil_B
Snipp og Snapp in norway
dat chicken impression
Lil_B: yeah, no idea how they got to those names...
d'aawwww
so cute!
ARE YOU MY MOMMY?
Tovler, yes. They were really badly censored in the 1990s. That's pretty much why I pretty much jumped ship as soon as I discovered anime.
08,01why do i find shy europeans so attractive? :P
Scoot jokes
good job haha
STOP IT MUMMY
wait
08,01oh *that* one is definitely scoots
I'm a shy European
:3

/me is still cleaning laptop
08,01Lil_B: you did, aye
What is this we're watching
I was shocked when I saw all the innuendo in Disney Channel's Gravity Falls.
YOU IDIOT
08,01Lil_B: maybe you were just nervous at meeting someone from l'interwebs
Fritz a Chip and Dale cartoon
BACK FROM SCHOOL!!!
Oh, aight.
I thought animation had very free rains in the 1990s, cut back in 2001, still cut back even more now, and extremely free in the 1930s
Trolled by an egg.
Mike answered my "do you speak whale?" question
hugs canadian_ brony
He said
"is that a fat joke?"
hi Bunny_Striker. School already? Ouch
seems legit
heh
hi fluttermac
not suspicious at all
I still think some of those very old cartoons are better than the ones today.
hi
Fritz yeah
Canadian_Brony: and I joined the football team too...
lol
It's one of the few times I'd agree with such statements
hwo is that pony
But, Animation is picking up thanks to technology and creativity
Now that's one big, angry cock...
Yeah, but come on
On the other hand... toons like Clutch Cargo... me mind rebells at those memeories.
I don' feel like watching some stupid 3D horsepoop.
nag nag nag
That child abuse.
xD
Western animation was very censored in the 1990s, probably to give concerned parents a refuge from the dark age of comic books (which was spilling over into video games too)
I'd rather watch some old 2D classics.
Foghorn Leghorn would have acted much more civil.
oh god
:D
Fritz indeeeeeeed, Cheap CGI 3D just ruins everything instantly
" 's gonna be liek in Doom"
oblivious mother chicken is oblivious
the day people stopped doing handdrawn animations was a sad day. i mean, just LOOK at the lion king
Fritz: uhh... 3D... i mean, avatar was good, but welll...
but Simpsons was allowed to speak about homosexuality, and show partial nudity, things they have trouble with now, but did not have then?
Well, I didn' mean Avatar
and not a single Scootaloo joke was made
I rather meant cartoons
I am proud of you
YES
FUCK YES
remember how guns shot lasers in the 90s Spider-man cartoon?
YES
Simpsons is sitll handdrawn Dark_Horst, and about 30% if MLP is I guess
PEW PEW?
Droopy Dog!!?
That episode:D
YES
YAY
Hi guys
TOMMY
YAAAAY
hi Spademagnes[R]
oh, T&J.
hi
This.
I've been busy playing Mario Kart Ds for a while
FUCK YES
3D movies are fine, but digitally alterd movies turned into 3D are hell
I REMEMBER THIS EPISODE
This will be always, and WILL ALWAYS be better than any of those sheety
what were they called
:D
the world is ready for 3D when they figure out to do it without giving people headache and make it work to watch it in 2D too
Cheap 3D = horrible, Expensive 3D = good
HAAAAAAAAX
Tilt!
3D TV I mean
all those things
Droopy cartoons blew my mind as a child.
What movies make 3d work well?
PHYSICS
lol
MadSurge you beat me to it

Oh I mean CGI, not 3D glasses, I don't like that at all

the worst thing about buffering. You can't pause the movie lest the rifftrax becomes off sync
the hecks with the robot vvoices
Yeah duddly became much less of a prick...
Thx cowvarkian!
to make sure it is in sync Quick_Thinker
huh
i are confuzzled
Quick_Thinker, it checks if it's in sync
Funfact: the actord plaing Dudley eventually lost so much weight that, by the time they filmed his scene in the 7th film, he had to wear a fat suit to look the part.
okay

NSMB2 needed the Football players, dolphin platforms, Mario masked koopas, and other general wtfuckery.
Sudoku is easy

oh hai Darth Snape
Besides fuck tons of coins is ANYTHING different from NSMB1?
11,01Really wish I was a Vulcan.
The only were thing in NSMB2 was that giant boo.

I was thinking about colour the other day, and I made a connection. The light spectrum is 7 colours, the rainbow is 6 colours, and yet we also have mixtures of Red, Green, and Blue; or Yellow, Magenta and Cyan. These 6 colours are made of each other and can be mixed to make an opposite colour.
/me hugs Rex_Mundi

Basically, we have 4 ways to make colour.
