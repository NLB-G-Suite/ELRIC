08,01i think Teachers' Unions are one of the worst thigns to happen to education
*nods in agreement*
yes
Saturn: I can name two things worse.
No stream :(
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWm9MXwMgag
1) Adminstration.
Watch this :)
2) Politicians.
08,01and don't get me wrong; my politics are generally leaning to the left-wing
http://www.derpyhoovesnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/006_i_mean_it_by_tehjadeh-d52kipy.png
G2G
Oh don't get me wrong, I don't disagree with you.
Bye Everypony
08,01CriticKitten: the Unions are the administration, generally
08,01and the politicians affect the administration
I just think if we're going to focus on the biggest problem? Start with those two.
Er, no, not really Saturn
Heh?
The adminstration would be folks like the principals, superintendents, etc.
08,01but I think the way in which the Unions work actually disadvantage good teachers
:<
08,01because they want to be fair to the majority, which means that exceptional teachers don't get recognition, or extra compensation
lol
Er, I'm not sure I agree with that either
:3
I like ponies :3
Same /)
The concern with merit pay is not that it rewards exceptional teachers (which it doesn't).
is the stream over or am i just laggy?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=YsJuNQTZhQk
It's that it punishes teachers for things they can't control.
nope.avi
hmm
/me tries something
yeahh
shoot
Changed clients to Nettalk. Hey there everypony! n_n
night everyone
good night
08,01CriticKitten: hmm, yes, i agree with you there
http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/10855
Night :3
nothing
It's actually been calculated that, in my state, I'm going to get a pay cut to keep my job.
08,01CriticKitten: move to england
08,01you'll be paid more
makes sense
I'm doing well
Aye but that's my point, Saturn.
good
AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!!
I'm gonna go take a shower. Be back in a bit :p
just spilled hot ramen on my lap
Egad
sad
>:(
Don't YOU want to become a teacher under those conditions?
I don't disagree that unions have done a lot of damage, but the policies being put in place?
They're going to swing the pendulum rapidly back the other direction.
*pokes in head* Hello...
Oh yeah, forgot to send in my lottery pics :$

13well not to mention the persistent calling them an Fn tornado when you don't do that until after the damage is assessed
TOBY?
11,01Radar tornado detection didn't start until 1970 ot do.

3am in ye'old maryland
11,01Now I see actual mesos.
13Alchemist: it's based on the TOTO project, drop a package of sensors in front of a tornado to radio back data from inside the funnel
11,01Also, they have NEXRAD realtime.
13aaaand watch the right side
13texas highway sign

13saw a making of for this once, there's a huge truck driving alongside them running the hail
11,01TOTO (TOtable Tornado Observatory) didn't make it into a tornado.
*Heaven Noises*
lawl!
13that's why the camera angle is ALWAYS pointed across the hood towards jo
lol
HHHHHAAAAAAAAAIIIILLLLLLL!!!!!!!
hail!
11,01I had a calendar from the movie.
all hail to the hail
HAIL THE HAIL
11,01It showed how the did the truck scene at the end.
^
HAIL!
00,02Shizuka, if you get the blu-ray copy, you can see some of that reflecting off the trucks chroming
I knew it
11,01When the F5 throws the tanker at them.
owww doesnt that hurt
we bow down to the hail
epic time!
ow
u idiot, that's gotta hurt
lawl dorothy
windigos
huh?
11,01Be glad this isn't 2-inch hail.
some one called?
13now... 1996... and they're building a platform to send into a tornado and keep radioing back information
oh shit there it is
SENTINELS!
11,01More clear-air mde.
spaaaaaaaaaaaaace
pepsi
11,01*mode
13couldn't they have, you know, powered it on BEFORE driving into the hail?
toooooooo the moon
^-^ i was referenced
Damit glass BREAK!
lol
11,01I think they learn that the second time around.
lol
00,02Shizuka, but wheres the drama in that?
yeah, uh, next time you invent a tornado measuerer thingy, make it turn on with one switch from inside the cab.
some day their having
11,01You just make it remote.
Saturn: dude O_O
Saturn: that is a bit too close for my comfort zone :D
13jonas had it on remote control
13and stainless steel lid
that tornado is evil'

TROLLNADO
Fly you Fools
13whoops, bill read the script before coming out, he knew the tornado would drop on them

This movie *facehoof*

11,01Actually, we figured out that we were looking at the wrong site.
:O

shouldnt the sensors fly into hte tornado already?
11,01It dropped.
11,01He's wrong.
Ugh
now kiss
don't be a hero!
Matilda is still more crazier than Jo
haha
13Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: yeah that's the bigger issue... with the sensors scattered it should have picked up
kiss
13but i suppose without the dorothy base they have nowhere to radio to
NOW KISS
This reminds me of my addiction of empires mod
dat range
Jo is suicidal =/
MERICA!!!
We're quite behind, apparently.
11,01SPC predicts tornadoes tomorrow.

yup
11,01But, yeah, the winds should carry the sensors up.
13see the only thing i can think of is if the dorothy base is destroyed then the sensors can't relay all the way back to the team
Dun dum dun dum dum..... Heres Trollnado
Night everypony!
13but... if dorothy is picked up... she'll still be destroyed by debris...
oh shit the tornado
"Do you hear Jaws coming?"
00,02Shizuka, its a tornado, you cant have something in a tornado and undamaged
11,01MaidSurge, it's >.(\-rific.
I keep hearing Tardis noises o.o
00,02Shizuka, Naturaly XD
11,01Phase4: Weak tornadoes.
Does anyone die here?
00,02Nittany_Discord, weak town relocating tornadoes
11,12Sleepy time ^_^ Night all :D
13see nittany can tell you random things about tornadoes, i can tell you random things about sirens

13iirc this one's supposed to be F4
00,02^
Alt F-4

whys that Saturn
o hai Saturn
13nittany's brain is hurting X3
oh hey spike whats up?
08,01Prick: because http://dantesgrill.deviantart.com/art/Celestia-Puppy-face-307750677

13not to mention
13how in the world does it still have power???
07I DOUBT IT
Saturn: DAWWWWWWWWWW
Delorean =/
Because Hollywood
11,01Shizuka: Aliens
00,02Shizuka, magnets
00,02alien magnets
13okay this is the scene i was talking about nittany, but it's only like half a second at the very end
Yo everypony
（￣へ￣）
13with SRS WOW bringing up the bass quite a lot i could catch the tornado rumble
:D
11,01Shizuka: I'm behind.
13and you can barely hear the sirens spin up just before it switches
8,6iiiiit's baaaa~aaaaaack
i guess i can give it a "d'aww"
/me 11,01listens
00,02Shizuka, never noticed that before
Sh** just got real
this tornado is pissed

08,01oh, also, something network security *and* pony related: http://blog.chromium.org/2012/06/tale-of-two-pwnies-part-2.html
8,6see, this is why I like Florida, 90% of our weather is predictable
shoot the tornado
11,01Police be policin'
13it's important to serve the whole "we had no warning" thing.. but you'd think you'd get more of a second or two before the scene changed...
8,6hurricane? see that coming a week early
11,01Tornadoes are predictable.
8,6thunderstorms? 3pm every afternoon in the summer
11,01Except on where it's going.
twister... why isnt this a rifftrax, that would be awesome
g2g everypony
13i know the rifftrax forums were begging for this to be done
13maybe someday
11,01http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html
00,02lol
00,02subtitles didnt match
Lots of young actors in this movie
11,01Damn Screensnapr bugging.
At least she's honest
and not a bitch
she ain't evenmad
Saturn: Twister
why cant most women be like this =/
I WAS trying to get my fic ready for submission to FiMfiction... and then Twister came on.
13i at least remember a year or two ago, one of the storms that had a tornado in hugo
11,01So, aunt Jo has an hour of warning?
I have made my laptop charger into a glowy head. tie. thing
11,01I was in Hugo.

GHOSTS?

11,01Yep. 1 hour of warning isn't enough.
Oh.
Saturn: :D
I...am...FORSAKEN!
13suppose i should turn my earbuds down now from the wakita guitar solo X3
Best City is Dalaran
before it became crap
13apparently in one of the exterior shots of the house, you can see the huge cables that were holding it up
13even in this rip i still haven't spotted them yet
wow... 96... 16 years old, damn...
11,01I was in Minnesota in '07 trying to catch a tornado.
08,01ponies do not need boobs

Yo Meg. You alright?
/me 08,01shudders
Saturn: O.O wat?
Saturn: -lol- :D
she's bleeding ;;
everything needs boobs... <_< >_>
08,01i just found a humanised celestia and luna comic
08,01and, to be fair, the clothes are all on
Saturn: eww
/me 11,01wanted to make a movie joke, but screensnapr is broke :<
08,01and stay on
08,01but still, it's disconcerting seeing them with those... things...
She's fine =/
she looks very fine
/me 08,01is definitely not a boob person
ITS A MAC
or not
i hear that saturn!
Saturn: but they were humanised. were the "equipment" too... defined?
yes... more ppl in a unstable house is best
/me doesn't understand boobs
13well apart from it being makeup
13it's just a bump you can tell
oh
Meg sont give a fuck
*dont
13being a head bump it would bleed a lot, especially if she was trapped in the basement and not able to clean up
08,01and bustards.
well it looked like she busted her head open
Saturn: oh u
Does anyone die is this movie!?
04Tom sets the mode for FUN TIME

Saturn: -lol- :D
Saturn: Dayum thats one Great tit
dat sanitary technique
Saturn: xD
13hen3ry: girls have magic cleaning agents in their tongues
13it's a scientific fact
Isn't that always a good time to walk into a conversation?
11,01SPC does tornado forecasting!
13just like tornadoes growling
Wait, we are talking about birds, right?
It's the same F-5 that killed her father!!!

oh ok lol but why does pinkie pie have all the food i mean thats not fair to all the ponies in the theater she needs to share
04I don't think I'd do movies

04Oh, and Courage if I can find eps
11,01Those skidmarks vanished.
11,01Did you see that?
ERMAHGERD! GERSBERMPS!

That truck must weigh more than a building.
11,01This is the second baynado.

13also the beeping noise on the laptop, it's not morse, i think it's RTTY
11,01hen3ry: One mystery solved.

TROLLNADO
Fluttershy is not amused.
PONY
11,01Now to outrun and F5.
8,6am I the only one here that wouldn't run through a cornfield?

08,01if you can't hear the individual beeps, it's likely rtty or sstv
YOU DO NOT OUTRUN A TORNADO ON FOOT
/me facepalms at this movie
COWS

Hello everypony :)

RUN
13Saturn: SSTV is a very distinctive sound from all the examples i heard, much higher pitched
11,01But I like chasing tornadoes.
oh this movie
I wanna know how much that poor farmer lost because of this.
They can Outrun a horse?
BEST ROOM EVER
13Om: oh just a bit breezy

Seems Legit

Fear me you sick son of a bitch tornado
grass=knife. board = missile
13strongest plywood shed ever
hold on tight
ahhhhh that must be quite exciting RD approoves
if you hand onto a pipe, you are not going to survive you dumb retards
That would not work.
11,01Shizuka: Don't forget, they changed the scale in the US.
00,02and heres the scene
fluttershy reinforced the shed with tears and sorrow.
13anyway, this scene is practical, they're hanging on a rotating set
8,6Shamroc, only a little bit
its Raping time!
they'd be ded
RAWRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
13so many stock thunderclaps X3
HANG ON

00,02if you'd said java i'd say quit

Never played paper dnd, but i have played many computer versions
did you use blue dye?
I um...might have found a way to instantly kill anything ever

imbue it into a dagger which did 1d4 + 4 damage with str modifiere
or something else
modifier*
...1d4 + 4 9/10 would put anything into the "i'm bleeding to death" state
seems legit
