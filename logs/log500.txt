Airpuff: i also totally butchered that quote...:D

The end
Bronysith: I heard of the name of the game, and i just loved the word "chrono" so i just removed the "h" and used crono for everything.
So let's recap: Child defies space and time by going into outer space. Diablo talks to him telling him to visit the ship. He escapes by hiding in DerpyBot, and NASA's crack team of expert guards doesn't notice.
:'(

More than she should be making, but less than you'd expect?
24?
21.99$

08,01considering she's just 3 years out of uni
Oh, then 60k.
What would you do for a klondike bar?
0,14$20 for wifin in the club?
*explodes*
ponibas: lol why
08,013 years out of uni, quit her phd to work for facebook in san francisco for $70,000 a year
I don't know. I make under 20k, so that's a lot.
HOLY
Facebook doen't hire just anybody. I should think it was fairly high.
0,14...Sweet baby Jesus.
....
This music is making me want to eat MARSHMALOW ;)
wow
wow
Mother of God...
I wanna be the very best. Like no Engineer ever was. To build hydroelectic bridges is my test. To make money is my reward
a phd and she opted for 70k??
A Purple Pony
Yeah, it's part of a new strategy that companies are rolling with. Instead of grabbing people who have finished their degrees, they're picking the talented ones out and paying them higher wages to convince them to quit their degree early..
I'm eating some right now TheWhitePlague :o
08,01her comment to me "i'm going to literally have more money than i know what to do with"
WOOT
FiW!
08,01i mean, shit, she's 24

lol
I'll brb guyz :3
and she's only getting 70/yr in San Fran???
This shall be the best
lol
08,01and the sucky thing about that is that i could go and do exactly the same thing: get hired by IBM or Google or wherever for disgustingly high amounts of money
THE END IS NIGH
08,01but i want to do this teaching thing, and...
08,01well
lol
FUN
teaching is cool dude
The good thing is that it leads to you getting a lot of money.
lol
The bad thing? If they opt to fire you, you're SCREWED.
Nomnomnom
WOW FUCK HOMEWORK! IM MISSING A RARITY EPISODE????????
08,01teaching salary is about £21,000 starting salary in Scotland
so which episode is this
08,01moving up to about £30,000 after 5 years
awwww
Because then you have no degree, so that'll limit your options.
awwwww sweetie bot
I want to hug you!
Sweetie bot is ADORABLE

teaching isn't about money man.. and wanting to be a teacher you know that
oh
/me dances AFK

geeky-brony: if ur links are too long, use this site http://derpy.me/ it helps
:<
Aka the people who push all of the blame onto teachers.
Diglett: then what dose celestia do?
08,01because they want to be fair to the majority, which means that exceptional teachers don't get recognition, or extra compensation
ok MahBoi777
08,01and therefore have less incentive
MahBoi777: Spank you
lol
Er, I'm not sure I agree with that either
:3
I like ponies :3
Same /)
The concern with merit pay is not that it rewards exceptional teachers (which it doesn't).
is the stream over or am i just laggy?
CupcakeWarrior: :O really? me too!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=YsJuNQTZhQk
It's that it punishes teachers for things they can't control.

BroKnee: (\

yeahh
shoot
RyunosukeKnT: what are you trying?
how do i get to microsoft sam
Merit pay is a wonderful idea which has been twisted into a system whereby good teachers get the same pay for many many years, while the administration rake in more money.
well guys, I probably should get some sleep, got work in the afternoon tomorrow, and I need to clean up the fallout from my second monitor's purchase
Changed clients to Nettalk. Hey there everypony! n_n

Hey Polydunami

It's actually been calculated that, in my state, I'm going to get a pay cut to keep my job.
it might actually, and you will have to wait to see if it gets picked ;)
hey Polydunami! how are you?
08,01CriticKitten: move to england
08,01you'll be paid more

AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!!

>:(
The US wants to "fix" education by making teaching less desirable, awarding poorer pay, higher restrictions, and making it easier to fire you.
geeky-brony: dem crazy youngins
noodliepoodlie: that's not good
Don't YOU want to become a teacher under those conditions?
MahBoi777: lol
noodliepoodlie: I hate it when i do that ):
I don't disagree that unions have done a lot of damage, but the policies being put in place?
noodliepoodlie: how fitting, but OUCH
They're going to swing the pendulum rapidly back the other direction.
*pokes in head* Hello...
Oh yeah, forgot to send in my lottery pics :$
Hello CountDoofus :D
RyunosukeKnT: what is it? TELL ME! (please if you don't mind)
And suddenly we'll go from "major shortage of science and math teachers" to "major shortage of teachers PERIOD".
STREAM! WHY YOU NO WORK????
hello CountDoofus
if it gets picked, you will know, trust me
noodliepoodlie, because nobody is streaming >_>
Oh hey CountDoofus :3
noodliepoodlie: the buffer show is on
hi Rain
noodliepoodlie: it's the buffershow! silly
Why get a job in teaching if an equal job in a private outlet pays far more?
I love the buffer show :D
We're going to ruin our education system.
Just you watch.
/me 11,01buffers BroKnee

laters, LoyalDash
08,01CriticKitten: see, that's what's putting me off a career in education. i could be earning very very large amounts of money doing computery stuff for large companies. but honestly, so long as i can pay my bills, i'd probably be happier as a teacher, at least for a few years
Do what you want Shizuka
kirzstryfe: Someone keeps getting kicked?

hi
I just remember one of the tragiest scene in Disney history :'(
Teaching is steadily becoming a worse profession to be in.
Phase4: it was a f2p M1+W pyro
be back tomorrow for alien 2
CriticKitten: Woah waoh woah, how the hell does it idolizes the lottery system? It was pointing out how broken the current public education because of the difference in quality between public and private schools (I hope to God I know what you mean by idolize, otherwise I'm gonna look like a moron :P)
13hey
I myself might not stay with it for too much longer.

One wonders about his theological capabilities.
SunderlandPony89: Except that what the documentary doesn't tell you is that most private institutions perform equal to their public counterparts, barring several major urban areas....and the problems there go far deeper than the education.

So....that documentary's very much one-sided in its criticism of the system.
FUS RO DAH
Ooh, SB
the good spongebobs
Soooo, there at a farm right?
It's suggesting that the problem doesn't exist in private ed, but it does.
MahBoi777: raaaaaghaaaaaaaaa

Spongebob was never cancelled?
Because that tiny net is gonna help you!
Yeah gaige how did you not know
mornin' everypony
SunderlandPony89: It really depends on the region. Urban areas tend to perform more poorly due to their schools being flooded with children who purposely fail the tests or can't take them, thus counting against that school.

/me hugs geeky-brony, MahBoi777, Ponies47 :)
13silly shizu, it said 1969 right?
11,01The Fujita scale wasn't invented yet.
Hugs SunderlandPony89 back :)
00,10they have always gestamated those Shizuka
13not just that
Even better, ninety minutes of twelve men in a room arguing.
hang on!
they should had made the cellar 2 levels
11,01Two months after the outbreak that Fujita studied.
In retrospect maybe it was stupid of me to make the storm cellar door out of plywood and a shitty rusty lock
13storm shelters were typically built for nuclear sheltering too weren't they?
Nittany_Discord: I liked this movie the first time, but right after I watched, I realized how stupid it was
Nuts.
noooooo
13but yeah, flimsy wooden door, windows everywhere
13the moral of the story
LET HER RUN OUT INTO THE STORM
13jo's father was stupid
MMMMEEEEEDDDDIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCCC!!!!!!!!
IF YOU DO, THE MOVIE WILL BE OVER
Shizuka: ikr
DAMNIT
00,10yep
NOOOOOO
lol he dead
no! my house!
dat troll ass bir
d
00,10would not matter if they had no door.
bad enough i still have nightmares about this movie
13jo and mommy were just fine why didn't he stay back?
Shizuka: theres no way a tornado would have pulled them out of the shelter
present day.
Why do we need rifftrax when we have bronystate chat :3
Ion cannon activated
11,01We're on GOES 13 now.
13i like that random bass dive there
Shizuka, that's what I was wondering
00,10the twister can suck you out if there is no way for the air to flow through
Shizuka: failed physics
Throws a medic at TheRareP0N3
00,10cant*
Meanwhile in Canada
13i know most of the goofs in filming here now, watch the side of the truck for the helicopter taking this shot
oh no
nature happens
00,10shame there is no riff
hey Sumica :$
13also, watch behind them, there's cars behind even though this is clearly a deserted road
CAHT DERP HOLD ON
Oh no! If the Cells keep building, they'll have a record number of DBZ episodes showing on cable!
...
11,01Record dBZ?
11,01We might hit 80.
seeya guys, going to bed
Exposition~
They don't get in the way, Shizuka.
tired
That's better
00,10no worse then some of the B's we hand Shizuka
:)
gnight TheRareP0N3
13when this radar hits 88dBZ, you're gonna see some serious twist
bue bue TheRareP0N3
And this is all you'll ever get of his wife's character~
bai.
nitht TheRareP0N3
Twist is underrated. :|
Shizuka: ;D
Night night TheRareP0N3 :)
I like twisters
00,10such as the one where we could see the cameraman reflecting in car windows
She said a bad word
00,10and it was a sony handi cam
*:D
13that's true
what a twist
13throughout the movie they have trouble keeping the sky consistent
...
Anyone wana play any games?
11,01Give the dry line a push up a hill.
13sometimes it's way overcast, other times it's beautiful blue like this, also hi cameron did ferris bring you out here?
11,01*down
Hello, BroKnee. I would like to play a game.
rool the maps
Don't fold the maps and don't split the party!
Wait, that was a reference.
Bitch Please we're storm chasers
What game Polydunami?
EXTREEEEEME
is this twister?
yes
broniesrock: nope its Tornado
BroKnee, I was making a reference
manly handshake
oh
11,01That storm's gone.
13ignore the physics and most of melissa's scenes, these guys all have great chemistry
xD ohh
Dusty? That can't possibly be your name.
13philip seymour hoffman everyone
So I think I'll call you....Awkward Comedy Relief Man
So you don't? D:
I can't help but think the pony level in Diablo 3 is a major trolling by Blizzard.
meow
11,01CountDoofus: Their DRM is trolling enough.
CountDoofus, do you know about the cow level in Diablo2?
BRB I'm gonna go make some popcorn
CrimsonPhoenix: yeap.
Ponies47: awesome
kk Ponies47
Yeah, we did see the sky earlier, didn't look like that
She looks a little like Meg Ryan to me.
Stock footage of storms much?
then how is Pony level trolling?
A little.
look at the size of that laptop
11,01Note: SPC and local offices do the storm monitoring. Chasers are in-tuned with those people.
it's huge
13they're in oklahoma
Whoops

MahBoi777: lolololoololololoololololololololol NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

8,6Mips was in the path of the storm
Incidentally The Last Airbender also came from there

13it's just a weeeee too convenient that every single twister disintegrates immediately after passing over our heros
Tornados hate trucks
TORNADOES ROAR RIGHT
IM A TORNADO BICH
11,01I'm an F3. Rawr.
not the sucker zone
13no wonder they never get dorothy to work, they break tornados
FOR SCIENCE!
screwed for science
How are they not flying around right now?
11,01Shizuka: I have to agree.
13jo has a firm grip on the idiot ball
11,01Every tornado dissipates over them.
Nittany_Discord, http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tornado_hunter.png
11,01GabeMoist: Saw it.
13like especially here, does it just get tired after picking up and tossing the truck?
the tornado chooses who stays and who goes
11,01That is how we hunt tornadoes.
sooo pretty
murder
it has chosen its meal
Truck inbound
goodbye truck!
11,01The tornado's time is done. It gets rushed off of the set so the movie can continue.
Nuts
13just noticing... a red tractor is thrown towards the camera
Shizuka: It used up all of its mana and couldn't manifest itself without leeching more from its Master.
om om om that car
11,01It get paid in cows.
13the camera is on the side our heroes will show up from
Ah something about the smell of giant swirling windy death in the morning. Smells like....Ponys.
noooo
Eye of the Storm
dat face xD
tornado is full after eating that tasty jeep
13so why does jo's truck, which was thrown further into the frame, crash in front of melissa
lol dat face
Dat face
Does this movie have a flying cow?6_9
13but the red tractor is never seen again
mmm...jeep flavor
08,01fuck everything about insomnia
there it is
13also, her drivers side window forgot whether it was up or down in those shots
ah Shizuka it was just there
Lol
08,01i've been up for 24 hours straight now
that could be any luckier
XD
it lives!
Right.
lol
08,01an now i need to go to work
I've been up for 40 sumthin hours
:D where is her truck
Dat driving skillz
so awesome!
she's all "darn, just missed"
AEWSUME
Shizuka: Wasn't the tractor on the side of the road in that earlier shot there?
WHY IS FREAKING OUT SO MUCH
13i'd have to look again
CriticKitten, it was
I think I got the best B movie of choice yet
They psycologist needs tharapy
BroKnee: awesome
... They were almost killed.
Polydunami: awesome
I know u guys almost died and all but that was freakin awesome man!
geeky-brony no....not awesome
FOR SCIENCE!
It sucks
BroKnee: ok
late for the party
/me 11,01flies
13i think it's funny it isn't until the triplet waterspouts that melissa freaks out about bill's "chasing tornadoes" not being a metaphor for something
Wendys
13and it's not until the drive in that she gives up
lol i like that guy
kissy kissy
11,01What would chasing tornadoes be a metaphor for?
Woo!
I don't care who it is; if it's not a good vs. evil movie, death is not really awesome.
Ll
He dies
13melissa is pretty stupid throughout though... right here i would have spotted that bill's back in love with jo
13that grinning no way
Does anyone die in this movie?
How?
Nittany_Discord: Well tornados kill....So death?
"Losers"? You're down one truck and had no luck with your experiment, yeah no
YOU are the losers, Dusty
Chasing tornadoes is a metaphor for foolhardiness.
dat liability
13CriticKitten: well considering this epic storm system never before seen only produces... eight tornadoes?
wonder how much they get paid :/
... I'm feeling a little foolhardy.
good to know Polydunami
13over the course of two days i think
11,01And this is me.
MahBoi777: To chase tornados? -lol-
MahBoi777: Not enough..
13they picked good vehicles for the heroes convoy
indeed
wtf
11,01Almost got killed? Screw that, more tornadoes to chase.
im going erly to night cya evry pony
11,01Until I'm tired of chasing.
Goodnight geeky-brony :3

geeky-brony: /) later bro.

nith HiImSpike
Tornadoes, Tornadoes everywhere
Night night Polydunami :)
Shizuka: Yeah, that's sorta the point though. They're down one vehicle and are acting like they "won"? What would've happened if the EVIL CORPORATE GUY got the next one?
Then THEY won
/me hugs MahBoi777 cya
I'm not leaving.

11,01There were only 50 of them Shizuka. It's hard.
11,01It's rare
We don't talk about F5's here
HiImSpike: i think all fhe stuff you have installed is slowing it down. i reccomend you back up your important files somewhere and restore to factory settings.
13i linked that map of all the paths from like 1950-2006 right?
Shizuka: you wizard
11,01I saw a rain-wrapped F5.
I heard wizard
/me hasn't seen a tornado
its easy to see F5's... theres always one on our keyboards
13did you know if you google maps Joplin Missouri and go to satellite mode, they've updated in the last year
O U
13you can clearly see the path
11,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: XD
13also, it is such a colossal shame that this song was never released on the soundtrack
I see a whole bunch of tornadoes on my keyboard.
13turn up your speakers, van halen with orchestra

It's midnight in Vancouver
11,01Now I see actual mesos.
13Alchemist: it's based on the TOTO project, drop a package of sensors in front of a tornado to radio back data from inside the funnel
11,01Also, they have NEXRAD realtime.
13aaaand watch the right side

11,01It showed how the did the truck scene at the end.
^
00,02Shizuka, if you get the blu-ray copy, you can see some of that reflecting off the trucks chroming
I knew it
11,01When the F5 throws the tanker at them.
owww doesnt that hurt
13i think this is the bluray copy, but obviously scaled down in size a bit

some day their having
flying boat!
Big sister is watching.
13well they still have to get it out of the bed
11,01You just make it remote.

Matilda is still more crazier than Jo
wish fluttershy was here she could talk some sense in that big mean tornado

11,01Help, I'm in love with the multi-vortex tornado.

13but i suppose without the dorothy base they have nowhere to radio to
sheesh that lady has a death wish -lol-

Go straight to Oz. Do not pass go, do not collect your aunt and uncle.
08,01oh, also, something network security *and* pony related: http://blog.chromium.org/2012/06/tale-of-two-pwnies-part-2.html
what would police be doing?
8,6see, this is why I like Florida, 90% of our weather is predictable
shoot the tornado
11,01Police be policin'
13it's important to serve the whole "we had no warning" thing.. but you'd think you'd get more of a second or two before the scene changed...
oh hey spike did you tell rainbow dash what i sayed?
11,01Tornadoes are predictable.
8,6thunderstorms? 3pm every afternoon in the summer
11,01Except on where it's going.
Indeed Shizuka
twister... why isnt this a rifftrax, that would be awesome
Nittany_Discord: yup... they know that Tornadoes happen every day
save the food!

11,01Damn Screensnapr bugging.
Bye HiImSpike :)
she didnt love you
At least she's honest
13well when you get into your local weather station being geared up for storm tracking, they usually seem to identify the tornado-producing part of the storm and where it'll go, at least in the next hour
and not a bitch
she ain't evenmad
08,01so, um, what are you guys watching?
13unless that's just me in the twin cities cause we're only like 40 miles end to end
11,01Shizuka: The SW quadrant of the storm?
Flutter shy makes a twister
bye bye peace all bronies :$
kirzstryfe... why aint you asleep boi?
why cant most women be like this =/
Spriggals: :D
13i at least remember a year or two ago, one of the storms that had a tornado in hugo
8,6because Shizuka keeps starting movies at 2am
11,01So, aunt Jo has an hour of warning?
I have made my laptop charger into a glowy head. tie. thing
08,01hey Nittany_Discord: i know what your favourite World of Warcraft city is
11,01I was in Hugo.
thats not a good reason kirz...
(:(
11,01NVM
13they'd picked out some part of the storm and was tracking about an hour out where that part would be

Wait, we are talking about birds, right?
It's the same F-5 that killed her father!!!
Shizuka: it could take rust off a bumber
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: but i just did

I wish I knew how to code things...magical things
04Tomorrow I should have my new cooling fan and then I'll try to learn to stream soon ^_^
13oh my
Ghosties: ^^ how come you dont com on more
Ponies47: You haz a kitteh? awesome. ^-^
YAY Ghosties
oh you answered me kinda Ghosties xD
You have that backwards, I'm afraid, Ponies47. Your kitten just got a new human.
11,01Oooh, a new streamer.
13now we're in for it... ghostiestream
Panda: cause Ghosties is a ghost
Ghosties, so Yume Nikki stream will become a reality?
Finally, that freaking window cracked
11,01What will Ghosties stream?
11,01And what pony will he use?
what is this out of context words hour or something
xxMoopyxx: ladys love the mustash
Ghosties: It's a boy. I thinking about naming him Soarin :)
wonder how much pepsi paid to bave their cans be the ones used.
Nittany_Discord: i heard he likes scary shit
xxMoopyxx: he has swag
Nittany_Discord: lol trademark questions of bronystate?
04I probably wouldn't use a desktop pony :P Unless, maybe Vinyl
xxMoopyxx: You should see episode the episode "Boast Busters" of MLP, you'll find out.
Iron_Edge: My second kitty :)
13>biggest storm system ever
13>produces F5
11,01Hi F5.
13>broad daylight, no rain
04And I'd stream "horror" stuff
11,01>Doesn't produce massive outbreak.
Ram the Tornado! Avenge your father! it is your destiny
Ghosties: O_O horror?
Shizuka: seems legit
Ghosties: yay? *trembles in fear*
no rain?
Ghosties: :O
Ghosties: like amnesia and such?
04Oh yeah, I'm a huge horror buff :)
Panda: Jump Scares
Ghosties: hostel?
Iron_Edge: He's six weeks old. HE'S SO CUTE! :)
Ghosties: i will kill you xD dont scare me!
11,01It's probably a large storm.
04I don't think I'd do movies
13watch the road as the camera flies past, you can see the sand and past skidmarks from other takes of that tailspin
Ghosties: y not
Ghosties: games?
Ponies47: haha so much D''awwwwww XD
04But shows like Are You Afraid of the Dark, and Goosebumps would get shown from time to time.
Ghosties: oh neat
Ghosties: i love those shows !
Ghosties: YAY GOOSEBUMPS
04Oh, and Courage if I can find eps
11,01Those skidmarks vanished.
Ghosties: all my yes
Ghosties: want me to find some for you? ^^
Ghosties: I hope you don't mind if i try not to watch your streams (I'm a huge wimp when it comes to horror)
11,01Did you see that?
ERMAHGERD! GERSBERMPS!
wow
11,01The skidmarks vanished shortly after made.
13magic rubber
Ghosties: never saw Are You Afraid Of The Dark :O
13it...um... blew away?
Nittany_Discord: sand was pushed over them i think
Iron_Edge: I'm thing about naming him Soarin. I want to name him after a pony but kind of hard because it's a boy. I think Soarin would be awesome :)
still 24 minutes =/
to light? wont take
04Thanks for the help, Panda. I'll let you know if I have any trouble :)
HAVE A TREE
/me seems legit
13guess there's that too, enough dirt flying around they could conceivably be covered
04Oh, DeathStar, it wouldn't be all that bad
God watching this kinda reminds me of Katrina ):
fluttershy! goddamit what have you done?
Ghosties: no problem ^^ im only here to help everypony
11,01Open it.
Jo you crazy
Ghosties: You gonna scare us? :(
11,01Oh well.
13get us off this thing, something you don't want to hear out of context in that tone....
Trees
FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
DENIED
13oh my you're way behind
LOL
It must be fluttershy
dat CGI
Ghosties: you don't know how huge of a wimp i am
DeathStar: aww goosebumps isnt so scary
11,01Shizuka: We are.
Ghosties: i wonda
!!!
13truck crash
Ghosties: mind i pm u something
HAVE A TRUCK TOO
cow
DeathStar: those shows really aren't dat bad
04But games would be like Yume Nikki, .flow, Lone Survivor, Scratches, and, if I can really get it going, Silent Hill 2. Amnesia would probably throttle any kind of streaming I could do
13waaaaaaay behind X3
Stephen Colbert?
Uboooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
MahBoi777: to you maybe
04Sure, Shane
11,01The truck!
Fluttertroll

Ohai truck
04I'm not sure, haha
MICHAEL BAY'D
KA-BOOOOOOOM
13it was the 90s, can't go a whole movie without at least two splosions
can you do that? can you explode twice?
technically hit by another car. insurance will cover it
That truck must weigh more than a building.
11,01This is the second baynado.
EXPLOSIONS
13how did they drive through it though... did the chassis disintegrate?
Shizuka: lika boss
13WHAT IS YOUR LOCATION
What if she exploded, and then exploded again! and then!
MICHAEL BAYED
paint not even badly scorched
Ponies47: Nice name -lol- what color is he? That should help you pick a name.
no, we didn't
then you aint cool!

Good thing they didn't make six Dorothies.

11,01Swirly!
Cue the morse guy sending the info on how to defeat them!
lol fail
the tornado is angry!!!
13also the beeping noise on the laptop, it's not morse, i think it's RTTY
11,01hen3ry: One mystery solved.
hey everyone
TROLLNADO
Fluttershy is not amused.
nothing that you cant see anyway, wind speed and it goes in a circle... umm bit deal?

8,6am I the only one here that wouldn't run through a cornfield?

YOU DO NOT OUTRUN A TORNADO ON FOOT
13no steam i don't want to update you... and if it turns out you're the reason mips failed earlier i will break you....
/me facepalms at this movie
Dem horses so ded.
COWS

Ponies47: Well the only white Colts I can think of are "Fancy Pants, PipSqueak, Raritys Dad, Shining Armor, and a Royal Canterlot Guard"
catch me if you can sucka
Hello everypony :)
anypony interested in hearing a rough draft of a mashup from Sonic Generations?
dont go chasing toornados!!
RUN
dat poor dead horse.
Nittany_Discord: don't you love how nothing is broken until the twister is IMMEDIATELY on top of it?
11,01But I like chasing tornadoes.
oh this movie
I wanna know how much that poor farmer lost because of this.
MahBoi777: running from a tornado is futile
dem tools and sharp things
They can Outrun a horse?
The wind at that distance would only be. Oh 120mph....
noooooo applejack is in that thing !!!!!!!!!
BEST ROOM EVER
RyunosukeKnT: I know, they so ded
13Om: oh just a bit breezy
STAY OUT OF MY BARN!
lol!
hahah
11,01They could be running through RFD.
stay outta my shed!
Lol
Shizuka: Like a desk fan on high
oh bright idea there dumbasses
get to the shed!
safest place in a tornado. Room full of pointy sharp things
too dumb to live...
dat shed
13notice it's already spared the house
o my god who are these people?... uh theyre farmers
APPLEJACK!!!!!!!!!!!
13at that distance
8,6go Rainbow Dash go! make it bigger!
13an F5
This is Fluttershys shed
lets take shelter in a wooden barn full of sharp implementes
lol
go see the wizard!
11,01An F5 would have lifted the house.
when a tornado can ram a feence post through an oak tree
TROLLNADO
11,01Or part of it.
DAT DODGE
outrunning a tornado!
13a mile wide F5... spares the house... a couple dozen feet away...
Iron_Edge: Ah he is a PipSqueak. But that would be kind of mean. So Soarin's Blue and the kitten is white. Oh well. Soarin is a maybe. :P
this movie is so full of fail tbh
Seems Legit
11,01I wonder if Shizuka will facehoof before this is over.
they'd be ded by now
LOCKING THE DOOR? Really??
Nittany_Discord: at these wind speeds, doesn't grass = knives?
STAY OUTTA ME SHED!
wow thats is a string shed -lol-
11,01Pinkies4thWall: Actually, yes.
11,01Straw becomes arrows.
13remember kids, wind speeds up to / in excess of 300 miles an hour
oh god
I cant help but notice, her hair doesn't move in some shots.
13just hang out on the pipe
Nittany_Discord: ouch
Fear me you sick son of a bitch tornado
grass=knife. board = missile
13strongest plywood shed ever
Shizuka: wouldnt that kinda rip you in half?
Nittany_Discord: Also, don't you love how nothing is broken until the twister is IMMEDIATELY on top of it?
hold on tight
ahhhhh that must be quite exciting RD approoves
if you hand onto a pipe, you are not going to survive you dumb retards
That would not work.
11,01Shizuka: Don't forget, they changed the scale in the US.
00,02and heres the scene
fluttershy reinforced the shed with tears and sorrow.
Ponies47: Did you ping me?
13anyway, this scene is practical, they're hanging on a rotating set
Wait. the tornado is strong enough to lift houses up and they will survive by strapping themselves to a water pipe with a leather belt?
8,6Shamroc, only a little bit
its Raping time!
they'd be ded
RAWRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
13so many stock thunderclaps X3
Iron_Edge: eeyup
HANG ON
11,01F5 is taking it's time destroying the shed.
The belt is mightier than the twister!
Ponies47: saying?
11,01Nom.
kirzstryfe: riped in half only a little? hmmm
more like ctrl-f5
Singing paipz

13and the storm system instantly disappeared
GWAH

this would work but the debris woulda/shoulda killed them
That, is an F-2...Maybe F-3. Not an F-5
13at once
nevermind at those windspeeds, every piece of gravel, not to mention wood and metal debris, is a lethal bullet

MahBoi777: it really has ground coffee on it
Shizuka did you make this movie?
well it takes a lot of money to simulate tornado damage for a wide shot. Gotta hire the artists, paint the matte background...
11,01Your F5 was an F3. You fail.
If that movie was acurate. There would be no movie.
coffee in cheese?
Pinkies4thWall: you like so many of my favorite foods, why???
Shizuka: SO MANY FACTS I DONT REALLY CARE ABOUT BUT FEEL SMARTER FOR KNOWING!.... thats alot of caps

Shamroc: Well, it's SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT AUDIBLE.

xxMoopyxx: :D
There is no royal canterlot voice. Trollestia made it up after Luna came back, and told her they'd been doing it for like 900 years just to mess with her
Kencolt: it is tradition to use THIS MUCH VOLUME WHEN ADDRESSING BRONYSTATE
xxMoopyxx: oh dear :)

Not sure... if I like this song yet...

04Ain't butthurt, bro. Just incredibly juvenile of ya
its okay
waow
OneTrickPony: No links in this chat unless permitted, use #Vinyl_Scratch for requests. :P
Wow. I can't type and listen to music at the same time. Kudos to you, Phase.
00,02i have no clue what most of this code does
04I'll give you this, you're the first person to ever say those words in a sentence like that to me, so congrats
:|
Vordox: thankyou I wasn't sure
Phase4: I took a degree in CompSci when I was much younger (I'd be LOST to day) but yeah-- I remember trying to decompile stuff. COBOL was easier...
:|
00,02wow, massive classes and all thats wrong is unused imports and missing 'serialVersionUID'
Phase4: You kinda need to join #Vinyl_Scratch too. :P
Anyone here have D3?
not sure if eclipse or netbeans
I'm learning C++ right now.
00,02Vordox, its still muted
we need djponi3
oh by the way would you stop getting mad all the time
COBOL had that really nice aspect of "Oh, even my moronic superior in Accounting can understand this" because ti was effectively self-documenting.
Just got through the first class with an A, so the next step will be Advanced, then the final step will be C++ for Game Development.
04Dunno who you're talking to, Moopy
the guy kicked me
So...why is Vinyl muted?
i gona sleep im not in a good state bye
night Dark_of_Max
bye
gnight Dark_of_Max
04Yeah, because you sounded really base and juvenile. I ain't mad at you, it was just really uncalled for and not in a good way
Good night Dark_of_Max
waow sorry bro
04Hey, it's no problem.
04Just be careful and shit

Yea, my mom wouldn't care, its just my dad

04I...hmm...I dunno how to help with that BroKnee. That sounds way too heavy for anyone here...why not talk to a counselor or something?
Cheers CountDoofus.
Right, won't bother you again.
BroKnee....but other than that...my personal opinion would to stop caring about what your dad thinks......i dont care i spout out that im a brony at school all the time
DashWithRainbows: your the new art guy right? congrats!
04@DWR: I'm here because this is my shift :)
Teach me, oh wise one!

Congrats on the new spot, DashWithRainbows. :)
I do it at school too :p but I'm REALLY scared that he will actualy kick me out, I'm only 14 and can't really get a job here
Ninjazz: I don't mind being bothered. I wouldn't be keeping tabs on the chat if something something more words forgot what I was typing
DashWithRainbows: woo another art guy! have fun with kirz and the others
I'm back guys! What are we listening at?
Take your computer to Olly's then. Thanks StupidSexyCJ and Ninjazz.
WB MadSurge
04I'm sorry, man. I dunno what to tell you :/

Om: Got it.
04I wish you the absolute best of luck no matter what though
MahBoi777: http://derpy.me/-FUUy my OC
DashWithRainbows: I'm almost ashamed to ask this, but do you have a dA account?
BroKnee...you think your dad would kick you out for watching a tv show.....hmmm....just stick with your mom then...lol....again what i would do..but i dont half to
Someone got a Bronystate Spot of what?
Shamroc I do hope to have fun with the rest of the art team and cheers.
Ninjazz: You're acting strange >.>
00,02wow, bunch of imports there that were not needed
00,02the function that pulled them in was imposible to run
Ghosties, I don't care about 'qualification" I'm just confused and need a guide
Om: I'm juggling about 5 things right now. I'm trying to keep things short. :$
00,02well, it was imposible for it to run is the better way to say it
DashWithRainbows: YOu got a promotion?
Ninjazz: Fiar enough, I am being the bothersome one then :D BACK TO READING!
Shamroc, its the fact that I want to be soulfully honest with my father thats killing me inside
BroKnee..advice is given....you just gotta choose wether or not to disregard it or use it...
=__=
:D
CountDoofus Of course I do. Although, I prefer to use tumblr more often
Spectrum_Plush: I completely forgot about that picture, still.....awesome OC
yay!!
Fluflu's Lament!
:$ this song!
MahBoi777: silly filly
:$
00,02OtakuTom, you here?
*squees*
BroKnee.........hmm im not really used to this but im really trying to give my honest opinion of what i would do...so again...dont take it fully..
Yep
Vordox I'm the newest member of Bronystate's art team. So I guess it would be some sort of promotion XD
DashWithRainbows: cool, what's it called? I'll follow ya :$
04Eh, it ain't me man. I can't really tell you how to live your life like that since you're not technically doing anything "wrong." If worst came to worst I would suggest staying with you mom ideally but if that doesn't work then try a friend
DashWithRainbows: Oh mai! Hope to see your work performed. =3
Shamroc Alright well thank you
CountDoofus www.dashwithrainbows.tumblr.com
Done.
DashWithRainbows: dem eyes...they are.........uhh moo thats the word
Vordox I hope so too. Definatly going to practice a lot more now.
DashWithRainbows: You got streaming rights?
BroKnee: hope everything goes out great with what ever it is you choose
DashWithRainbows: nice tumblr art :)
Thanks Shamroc, means alot, you to Ghosties
04No problem
moo
BroKnee: you should do what you think is the right thing to do
Vordox Not that I know of. And even so, I wouldn't want to since I'm a bit... nervous when it comes to others watching me draw.
Shamroc: :<
DashWithRainbows: It helped out Wrek big time making other see him while he works.
DashWithRainbows: you ever paintchat here?
also BroKnee dont take everything really srsly as well.......i laugh my ass off when my mom gets angry at me sometimes ;p
StupidSexyCJ Nah. I don't like using paintchat
it lacks ctrl + z
Shamroc: moo
BroKnee: just makes her more angry thou
DashWithRainbows: Impossibru!
My dads not the person to see as humorous when he is angry
cow334: moo!
Who's streaming and what are they coding?
00,02the text i just selected
Hmmm...maybe I'll do that sometime...it'd be nice to practice drawing with someone there to help me refine it.
00,02is bad
Vordox True, but I don't see myself streaming any time in the future.
Shamroc: :< dont.... dont make me go there
00,02and should go far away
BroKnee..yeah thats the part thats hurting my advice giving.....the lack of a father is not really helping me
00,02and be elsewhere
Phase4 What is your work...? Litterally?
BroKnee: Boy when my dad is ticked off. Stay away from him :(
Phase4, you mean like the moon?
00,02moon would be good
00,02Vordox, not employed, uni student

Phase4: So it's an assignment?
hey ghost i have all these floods following me theres to many
00,02Vordox, nope

00,02Vordox, 'Shi-Chan', this is the paintchat
Shi-Chan? Shizuka?
00,02hasnt been touched sence 2003, so i found a decompile and started working

Ninjazz: its a good'n
Shamroc: :< na ah
00,02CupcakeWarrior, you paint, and it shows up on other peoples computers

StupidSexyCJ: It sure is... it's so freakin... mellow.

cow334...my story and im sticking to it
lol
00,02Shamroc, mPoll is a method, taken from a dynamicaly loaded class
Ninjazz: Muzzy - Sapphire (grovestyle remix)
*groovestyle
00,02.invoke runs it with 'tab' as the context and null as the parameter list iirc
Phase4: please dont you'll overload my robotic brain...it has poor memory...

STAR TREK CLASSIC
lol
Are people making requests for music or is he playing randomly?
/me ok now i've to play Star Trek and blast this on the Mic
BroKnee: Yeah, in PM, but don't spam him. :P
That's all for me folks. Good Night, I must give in to Luna light.
/me starts STO
So...what ahppened to ShiChan?
night Om
How do I pm? >.<
Goodnight Om!
broknee /msg name text
Ty
00,02jscontroller.openWindow(null, s3, null, true, false, true, true, false);
Good night, Om!
00,02thats not at all cryptic
BroKnee: double click there name i think
00,02night Om
what language is this PaintChat written in, Phase4?
00,02Java
Ninjazz: MahBoi777 cya
gnight Om! sleep well
:o uhh who is streaming?
night Om
<.< LAWL, you sure a Null should be used in Java, Phase4 ?
oh goodnight Om
00,02Vordox, its valid
Ah, no wonder I had a hard time understanding it...I was terrible at Java...lol
Phase4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnhjWUepaE8
Nighty night, Om
00,02but you get null refference exceptions if you try to use it
A null is pretty suicide what I have noticed,rather give it a neutral standpoint with a 0 instead of a nothing"
Also Phase4 you need two screens for this. XD
00,02stupid mouse wont go fast enough
Maybe I'll do better at it now since it's been a while from when I did Visual Basic (I kept messing up the syntax between the two)
from nearly everyone i asked i heard Java is nothing but pain in the ass ...
00,02Vordox, LAptop
00,02diddutz, it is
Phase4: Damn...I tried to do some sort of mix where I can work, and watch/listen at the same time ot the video on a laptop...IMPOSSIBRY
Phase4 you can have an extra monitor hooked up to a labtop.
Yea, I've gotta see what else my college offers so I can avoid doing Java for my degree.
00,02Vordox, its easier on linux
diddutz: It's good for what it is, but it's not prefered
00,02theres normaly more google while programing (for documentation) but i'm just doing legwork here
00,02removing warnings
ha...dat halo music..
00,02documenting stuff
aahhhh Halo 2
dar Halo 2 music
yesssssss the halo sound track i love it
oh damn Phase4, you're playing one of my favourite halo songs.
uhh what is this.....the library? or somthing else
im a big fan of halo
00,02mouse sensetivity is at max and its not enough
Vordox: any examples for what java is good for?
Yes this is the song I asked him to play
i know me to
diddutz: Web stuff
halo 2 every pony
Halo is an awesome game
I have never played Halo :$
DON'T HATE ME! :'(
hell yeah
diddutz..playing minecraft and other java games in browser..
well, i don't think i am going to have to do something that cannot be solved with php and ajax
well i got the whole halo games over here
I reall ydon't play video games at all :$
Phase4: what did you think of the song
*really don't
and i am sure minecraft would be a lot faster and more stable if written in something like c
00,02cow334, not what i expected from halo
00,02diddutz, it would be
hey phase 4 play the blow me away by a halo soundtrack
Phase4: In a good way or a bad way?
00,02minecraft is exactly the sort of work java fails at
00,02xxMoopyxx, pm me a link and sure

Phase4: its played during a free roam part of the game...not much action..

00,02this a lot of lag
I've never had any artistic ability my entire life but I just spent the past 2 hours freehand sketching Spike licking Big Macintosh's nutsack and it's actually looking pretty good!
i dont play TF2 Ponies47 so would know your pain, just hit it a couple of times :P always does the trick
HatefulWrath: GTFO :|
like, pony porn is seriously motivating me to become a better artist
I'd like to draw Big Macintosh cumming all over Spike's tummy, and then scan it and vector trace it and make it look as cannon as possible.
HatefulWrath: We don't tolorate (squee) like that here :|
that would be grrrrreat
Well i started downloading team fortress two right
HatefulWrath: Your grossing us out. Get outta here you perv :|
now\
cow334: YAY :)
Spike and Big Macintosh are my 2 favorite characters. Spike because of his incredible cuteness, and Big Macintosh because of his insanely large black stallion penis.
Learn to troll better
I want to see it spray cum all over
i dont like pony porn, and when somepony says that its just to weird for me lol
fat ropes of cum running down the walls
Ponies47: it's going to be my first time playing it i cannot wait\
What is server name?

cow334: I'm saving for a new computer :)
Hopefully I can play without much lag
Ponies47: that is good to here i'm saving up for a ipad
Unlikely though due to being in Australia
cow334: Okei doki loki :)
Ponies47: haha

Custom models

Degrrot hale.
I think it's a special character the guy which has the highest score gets
What class, I meant.
Phase4: Why does it seem like there has been so much trolling here recently? We just had some one by the username of HatefulWrath say some really nasty stuff about Spike and Big Macintosh :(

k, fixed
Anyway to counter engi camp. as solider direct hit or mangler. magler charge takes down the sentry direct hit dmgs almost as much as demo nades with more range then sentry so unless they have wrangler.
spy is obvious and so is heavy medic charge.
Demo sheild charge in and spam loch n load or vanilla nades

00,02XD
00,02paintchat is vegas
Eeeyup
00,02allso opinions on the new banner in the twilight room?
Paintchat is my mind. Either very bucked up or sane
Phase4 hmmmm?
:D dat art!
00,02it'll show up on the stream soon
00,02hopefully
Oh Phase4, I heard you like bugs, played Dead Space ever?
Phase4 ah i'll keep a eye out then
00,02Vordox, :<
00,02thin purplish banner instead of the giant image
Just asking if you played Dead Space XD
Streamception.
No banner yet for me
00,02there it is
I see it. Tis very nais.
Phase4 looks good and it will help let the browser run faster?
I like the picture
Yea, I do like that
00,02killerpony7733, it wont make a difference if your browser is any good
13this unknown, yet beautifull (and emptyheaded) girl pinches my bum at school, and tells me how hot i am
00,02OtakuTom, yeah
13i was like "OBHFGOIREGILNERG"
00,02we only have twi and rarity right now
13seems she was using drigs
Sorry chat derped did you respond to what i asked Phase4?
00,02only the twi is up though
00,02"killerpony7733, it wont make a difference if your browser is any good
Phase4 ah ok just thought that having less browser space usage would speed it up but nvm :)
O.o dude what
13i know right? she got excpelled for extreme bullying, drugs and sexual harrasment
00,02killerpony7733, generaly memory usage doesnt effect speed that much
00,02bigger images shouldnt change it that much
Phase4 alright guess i'm more wiser on that then ;)
So Phase4 . How often you play TF2?
00,02usualy once a night, not allways though
Phase4 But it does save you a tiny tiny bit of time by not having the image above instead of the thin banner
Ah ok I feel bad Phloging the unexperianced.
00,02killerpony7733, yeah, loads faster
00,02but its kinda a hack right now
Phase4 Eh? :O
00,02the image is still in the source, its over-ridden by css on the page
13ahw, i was dipping my cookie in a class of milk, it broke off
13soggy cookie ;.;

aaaaaaaat well that one works
it needs to update on every 2 hours maybe?
It updates every 5 minutes iirc
00,02why does windows not have an allways ontop button
^
02Oh, lol
x 100000000
that needs to be changed
00,02sometimes you just want a window to sit there
00,02linux has one
02Night is now starting spam for chatstats
brb getting linux
I'm pretty sure there's 3rd part apps that will do that.
00,02i actualy know the reason and its IMMENSELY stupid
Phase4: Windows was meant to be USED not CHANGED
!chatstats
Loading stats program...
because most people are stupid?
00,02|Discord|, i;d belive that if it was usable
!chatstats
You can only update stats once per minute.
to every 2 hours to actually be not so annoying....
Ah
Phase4: lol
I don't think it auto-updates
02Yes, that's what spam is for
02:'D
No....
02sure it is~
/me slaps BlueFlare
there is a workaround but it can get expensive
NO
02:<
buy more monitors
>:(
00,02the crap is going on
02Of course, I actually missed when people started to boost for being in top 30
02Not
02LOL
00,02somethings thrown an exception
d3rb imagine having a full surround monitor up
Running automatic stats updates. Loading stats program...
d3rb: There is a workaround for everything but it might not always be legal or might be to expensive but for me it is just a snap of the fingers and I get what I want.
00,02and the debugger is lost somewhere in the bowles of the class loader
NOOOO
02I just find the chatstats thing sad and spam encoraging, Imo.
02:[D
soon i will have my tv as a monitor once i have a desk that will fit it :D
oh it does it in like an hour
00,02d3rb, linux uses multiple desktops as well
00,02EXCELENT for laptops
Phase4: My laptop has windows
02incoming spam!
:(
bleh
can't you emulate 2 monitors on 1?
not a fan of laptops
00,02i feel sorry for you
Well Ray, if they do, then I will enable anti-chatstat-spam mechanisms
Or get it to ignore them completely for stats
00,02allso you will never get me to say windows is good
02Please do, lol
02nuuuu
02D:
02that would make stuff much easier in life
Phase4: You just did :)
02I rarely spam tbh
02and save up work for mods
Phase4: May I recommenda video THAT may help you feel better? =3

Anyone know if a single Geforce GTX 570 will be enough to run BF3 on max settings?
maybe not max but high
Phase4: ! I got another video you MAY like.(Let's see if you all know the names and stuff!)

sadly a programmer must see his market, and dat means windows, again sadly
02oh nos
Phase4: uh... more details please?
Shimmer i believe i have that graphics card on my currently broken laptop it will be able to run and medium or low for good speed
00,02Simon, poni pony pony
Yea, I don't think it'll do max, but I wouldn't know off the top of my head.
Simon2: pony, all of it. all.
I will makes you all pay
killerpony7733: It's for my desktop and you can't compare laptop gfx cards to desktops :)
I had 2 460's in SLI, and I don't even think I had it on max.
Phase4: May I send you one video I recommedn EVERYONE here to se? :)
00,02sure
It's a rather "unique" one
Then again, I was also recording with Fraps, so that would've had an effect, too.
Shimmer hmm i know GTX are higher tier graphics cards so may be able to run up to high maybe
Shimmer: what is the rest of yourhardware like?
A simple "pony" isn't gonna help
00,02after this i'm back to programing

Do you have a set price you're looking for with video cards? I'd actually recommend going with something like a GTX 670 if you can find it around $400.
Shimmer: or you get 1 570 now, that should give you good to decent performance, then wait for prices to drop or a new model and get another 570 cheap

/me eats the eaten hammer
Ill see you guys later. I've got to go get half of my foot burned off in surgery
Well Jim I did play Phase in TF2 today think he was lagging cuse i managed to pholg him with no problem
Not bad, Shimmer. The performance difference would be worth the extra cost, IMO, and you won't have to worry about SLI.
/me hugs Sylandest for helping

I'm trying to gauge interest in trying to set up a Minecraft server (or 2...one Survival and one Creative) for the Bronystate community. Would anybody be interested?
blame the zombies
I should enable utf-8 characters for nicks
Maybeh, OtakuTom
so then I can do /nick ♥
|Discord| you don't look good :$
I would if I played minecraft :p
oh...I hit the mute button...explains everything
02you should do that
02derp
I don't play Minecraft, but who cares. Go for it, I say :)
I'm lazy
+ it'll break services
what's the stream guy doing? chat code?
OtakuTom sure i got minecraft
Also
02oh
because you guys probably don't read topics
I don't like this remix :S
derpy_pony: I believe it is code for the Paintchat on the webpage
Nicks no longer expire
oh...never been there
If you want a nick you'll have to ask someone who has the power to drop nicks
Yes, it's for Paintchat
Am I the only one that actually reads topics?
all halfops and above have that power
I heard bears and wolves live there
not sure if they know how to do it but that's fine too
And owls
derpy_pony: that's why Phase4 wants to renovate it, to see if people start using it again :D
He's not the only one writing code right now (I'm at work, and not being very efficient...)
02I read them :&
good luck :)
00,02one of the things thats been requested is a proper login

So I think I've decided what I'm gonna do. I'll build a cheap linux box this weekend and set it up as a Minecraft server. Once I get it set up, I'll start giving out the IP address to anyone who's interested.

Sounds like a plan OtakuTom

/me invislbe~
Which is?
00,02Vordox, what is it?
/me is rocking the bass
Vordox that you may have but you will only reignite a pointless argument :D
or is he saying "bring back the bass"?
"Pft, Computers is better hardware." "Atleast we console users buy finished hardwares instead of faulty ones each year."
/me cuts the mid range and drops the bass
14D: nooo
The story of a man and his long lost bass

Phase4: i hear "bring" so imma go with "bring back the bass"
invisible
stupid keyboatd
..
/me glomps~!
/me brings back the bass instead
aww
Vordox, I already have a response to that...
Just had that thoght, how often do we upgrade PC compared to Consoles? If there's a faulty hardware in Console, they get refund, but if it's pC you have to buy better stuff :P
4 letters...RROD
/me eeks and falls again
yay
OtakuTom: You do know Xbox is a PC right? :P
00,02Jim, dat yatze
14ok ok you win this time >:(
there is wisdom in this pic
LAWL
Vordox: or you get warranty...?
rofl
OtakuTom Deus ex? :O
00,02aparently this video is unlisted, heres de link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36ds_wnyMW0
OtakuTom wait you said RROD
d3rb: Yeah but Xbox is not part of consoles.
Never have been a part of consoles, never will be consoles. :p
:D
How is Xbox not part of consoles?
/me cuddles :3
i mean pc hardware, my graphics card crapped out just before the 3 year warranty ran out so i got a new one, next model up too

Consoles are Nintendo, Sony, Sega, Amiga(Former generations), Jaguar series.
Vordox still have my xbox 360 and ps3 but i don't use them
14great :D
Of course, we have the Handheld COnsoles but they are a unique series.
either you use mouse and keyboard, or you use one of these control pads for the motorically challenged
Still saying the same thing how often do we need to upgrade things on Consoles? :P
o3o
depends, if apple ever makes one, every year :D
^
My PS3 is working awesome, My whole PS library works, My NES still works after 20+ years soon
derpy_pony pc mouse and keyboard users also have a higher typing speed and what not
Stronger wrists too
Also, this was sparked from what Phase4 words said before
I bet your stronger first is gonna win you that bar fight ;D
14oEo
"I5 is like a faulty I7" <-- Isn't that a scam?
wrist*
killerpony7733: when I see console users play fps games...they should try unreal...not a fucking chance
oro
My PS3 worked perfectly until I tried to swap out the hard drive...the screw holding it in place was so tight I ended up breaking the system and had to buy a new one without the backwards compatibility...
Derpy_Ctrax: Who the heck plays FPS on Consoles?
derpy_pony oh unreal ;)
00,02fun fact: the xbox 1 was allmost an ibm compatible machine
(OH yeah XBOX HAHAHA derp..urgh)
Vordox COD players >_>
I know that already Phase. Why do you think I call it a PC and not a console? :p
00,02as in x86 cpu, bios, 1980's interupt controller, the works
My first-run Xbox 360 ran for 4 years before it got the RROD, so I didn't have warranty on that one, so I had to buy a brand new system.
Vordox you sure its the right person?
killerpony7733: Aaand how many of these people join competative gaming scenes? Oh right there's hardly any :P
fun fact, original xbox 1 controlers can crush a child
00,02the bios was the non-standard bit, did some signiture stuff that was hileriously broken
14hi LL
Weren't you programming Phase4? :p
Vordox i never heard of real official ones but COD elite conventions has i think
14oço
14oЯo
12hai
killerpony7733: And then a Cronus user comes and whips all their arses, what's the point of fair game then, killerpony7733 ?
00,02Vordox, i was
Vordox but im kinda and im saying just kinda interested in BLOPS 2
00,02then i started talking
Correction: It's not that I didn't have the warranty...it's that the warranty expired well before the RROD.
Phase4: XD
OH GUYS! I found SOMETHING AMAZING!
show us!
Vordox: what is it?
a unicorn? Vordox
I'm getting it, so I can whop arse on ANY console!
Oh yea, I already read about that.
a compatible usb stick...
hm...yeah
Vordox: wait, whoa whoa whoa. thats actually possible?
Sylandest: YES!
Vordox mouse and keyboard on consoles? LOL
YES killerpony7733
Why do you think i said I lol at the "Console FPS"era? :p
Vordox that is just gonna own anyone
killerpony7733: YES! my point exactly
hm...
Vordox: that's actually pretty awesome.
I know RIGHT!
Vordox: my friend has been doing that for years, but he's been modding his console for longer...
But first I need to buy it and test it out
As soon as I can afford when School starts again <.<
*using a mouse and keyboard that is
Vordox still though you will have to deal with annoying narrow FOV though :'(
This means I can go to ANY gaming scene with my PS3 Controller, FECK YEAH
Vordox: we await your test results :D
lol
"Oh you play Xbox games, WELL FU" :P
Or "Oh you wanna play a competive Mario game on Wii mote, FECK YEAH I have controller" ! <3
i want that thing for pc :D
d3rb: Why? You already have USB control
Full USB control that is
No one appreciated the work pinkie put in this performance :(
oh wait, forgot about the drivers for ps3 controllers, never mind
I hope Cronus gets released soon! <3
i can do what that thingy does already

Hmmm...I keep jumping back and forth between setting up the Minecraft server on a Linux box or if I should just put it on my Windows machine...maybe I'll do a test on Windows first to make sure there's enough interest here for it before I spend a couple hundred dollars on building the linux box...
CountDoofus: congratulations!
congrats CountDoofus
*expects lots of downvotes and hate comments for some reason*
CountDoofus: Nice!! :)
OtakuTom: TL;DR
hope you have good comments on it
What is it about CountDoofus? :P
<3 this song so much
Still, it's the same fic that took third spot in the Bronystate fanfic competition after a big revision, so I guess it's kinda good :p
CountDoofus: just kinda good, huh? :D
:D
mm....
An artist should never be happy with his work, that's when it actually becomes crap.
(Not saying I'm an artist, for the record.)

Phase4: I know that...it's more a matter of how much it would/could tax my system while I'm trying to do other gaming. I'm also considering just finding a server hosting service 'cause I use a lot of bandwidth as it is from making videos and uploading them to Youtube as well as streaming on Twitch TV.

HAPPY NOW?
I'm looking through some server hosting sites right now. I found one that's pretty reasonably priced...$26 per month for a server that should comfortably support up to 64 players simultaneously (and I doubt we'd go that high for simultaneous logins)

>.>
is everyone dead?
My dad thinks im weird :p
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=lz6uYZV5tYY
guess not
so many bad dubs out there
SuperBrony64 should stream something
orly TheHoodyNinja
just saying
11,12I should possibly stream something...
sounds good
or something
Hai all
im one of those
and hi Arentius
hai Arentius
how we all doin
being bored maybe
ergo, nothing
im stuck between staying here and being random or playing a game, which should i do?
lamenes
which game, TheHoodyNinja
you should randomly play a game while staying here
cowvarkian: the ultimate nerd game
which one
DnD
ah, I wanna play
I miss DnD :<
the OG of RP
hmm
im assuming you mean pen and paper DnD, not the computer game >.>
but, the fuck do I know anyways
cowvarkian: the og part yes, but i have computer version to play
nothing like going bard then evolving it into an assassin..those were the days
I meant the one you were playing, yes TheHoodyNinja
Never played paper dnd, but i have played many computer versions
indeed Arentius
My DM always hated me though...I was one of those people that constantly broke the game without breaking the rules
did you use blue dye?
I played ADnD 2nd edition with my dad a few years ago... but I never played it since, and I cant really find anyone else to play it with >.>
*my dad and some other people
I um...might have found a way to instantly kill anything ever
heh
can't remember the name of the spell now
but it reduced anything you touched to 3hp
is it "the spell of fucking douchebaggery"?
imbue it into a dagger which did 1d4 + 4 damage with str modifiere
or something else
modifier*
...1d4 + 4 9/10 would put anything into the "i'm bleeding to death" state
seems legit
it actually was...my Dm hated me for it...so much so that he caused my dagger to be stolen..then the spell was mystically forgotten by everyone everywher.e...at the same time
hmm
seems... fucking silly
wb
ah DnD 3.5 was horrendously easy to break
just make a sorc and blow shit up
it was fun finding new ways to annoy my DM
13thanks :3
13!pokemon
13.3.
!pokemon
Nick, you are a 10Bibarel.
13LOL
NOOOOOOOOOOOO

hmm
...i did it by accident

6!pokemon

Aurora, you are a 4Heatran.

Nick, you are Pootis Man

hmm

/me shoves a crayon up Nick's nose

Gz alexxm
And hi
hey Shimmer
short story: university decided that they void one of my completed classes and fine me for about 500$. and of course its bullshit.
Jim no, but I have a MIDI File for the song on the Piano, and I'm trying to recompose it in LMMS
hey Shimmer hows your day been
hi Shimmer
ahh
Alchemist: that suck's...
Ohai bronystate
ohai Petrified_Discord

hey Petrified_Discord hows your day been
hey Petrified_Discord

Elondras: its not over yet. I appeal to the Dean first, if that fails I will appeal to the ministry of education.
Pretty good alexxm. U?
Alchemist: i wish you good luck with that
thanks. I will need it.
i'm good Petrified_Discord got a trial shift at a cafe i gave my cv to
Alchemist: The Ministry of Education sounds like wizards. Are they wizards? :O
:D
Alchemist: Woot!
alexxm: Woot!
dammit tab... :/
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsJuNQTZhQk
Petrified_Discord: well the ways they operate is cetainly magical :D
Hi.
Alchemist how do they "Void" one of your classes? Do they just say "Nope, you haven't done this class!" And Why the 500$ ?
Hiya SomeRandomPony
Hey SomeRandomPony
ohai SomeRandomPony
Great, now I'm bored.
hi SomeRandomPony
hey SomeRandomPony hows your day been
Shitty, and yours?
I wanna draw, but at the same time I don't want to...
What's a girl to do?
1st world problems?
WindWhistler: Half-draw, half-don't-draw
Petrified_Discord: :|
Draw Schrödinger's Pony
dat ö
You can watch me shuffle the chat
Lil_B: they said that I didnt complete a prerequisite of a certain class, so I couldnt have completed it officially. Thats why they say they void my grade. the 500$ fine is because I actually attended the class and took an exam and the amount supposed to cover the exam and training fees of the professor.
