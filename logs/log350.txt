I'm not sure if it was people getting pissy over the name or legal issues regarding the names origin and possible copyright infringements. Although, Derpy was a character created by Hasbro, just without a name, and fans came her a name.

Thank god it wasn't twilight, she would've gone into a coma.
good thing it's not the NEverending Story
reading a book is only 80% awesome D:
